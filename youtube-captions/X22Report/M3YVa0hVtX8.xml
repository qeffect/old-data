  <text start="37.94" dur="5.37">februari fourth 2016 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="40.97" dur="3.99">the episode is the economy completely</text>
  <text start="43.31" dur="4.38">collapses with a two hundred and</text>
  <text start="44.96" dur="5.34">eighteen percent increase in layoffs</text>
  <text start="47.69" dur="5.13">let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="50.3" dur="4.53">collapse financial news we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="52.82" dur="5.04">head out to Greece and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="54.83" dur="6.27">problems in Greece have not been fixed</text>
  <text start="57.86" dur="7.28">whatsoever even though the central banks</text>
  <text start="61.1" dur="6.42">are piling in debt into the country</text>
  <text start="65.14" dur="5.17">stealing the country of its natural</text>
  <text start="67.52" dur="5.489">resources and stealing basically</text>
  <text start="70.31" dur="6.33">everything from the country we see the</text>
  <text start="73.009" dur="8.071">people have had it they&amp;#39;re done they are</text>
  <text start="76.64" dur="6.06">on a 24-hour strike and it was launched</text>
  <text start="81.08" dur="3.81">by almost all professional groups</text>
  <text start="82.7" dur="5.19">workers public sector employees mass</text>
  <text start="84.89" dur="5.58">transport services they&amp;#39;re saying this</text>
  <text start="87.89" dur="5">is absolutely ridiculous thousands of</text>
  <text start="90.47" dur="7.47">people have taken to the streets and</text>
  <text start="92.89" dur="10.69">they&amp;#39;re protesting about pensions about</text>
  <text start="97.94" dur="9.96">taxes and how they were lied to by the</text>
  <text start="103.58" dur="6.539">government and we see even the offices</text>
  <text start="107.9" dur="4.259">of the ministries the municipal offices</text>
  <text start="110.119" dur="5.551">schools universities public hospitals</text>

  <text start="115.67" dur="6.239">the harbours due to the 48-hour strike</text>
  <text start="118.4" dur="5.43">and we&amp;#39;re seeing that the airports they</text>
  <text start="121.909" dur="4.951">had a reschedule because of what is</text>
  <text start="123.83" dur="8.49">going on there and the sentiment on the</text>
  <text start="126.86" dur="8.34">ground is that tsipras fooled the people</text>
  <text start="132.32" dur="6.87">and promised to reverse austerity cuts</text>
  <text start="135.2" dur="6.12">and he&amp;#39;s doing the opposite he did a 180</text>
  <text start="139.19" dur="5.67">and went along with the central bankers</text>
  <text start="141.32" dur="6.09">and we see right now the people are the</text>
  <text start="144.86" dur="5.7">ones who end up suffering from all this</text>
  <text start="147.41" dur="6.24">the central bankers they&amp;#39;re coming in</text>
  <text start="150.56" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re buying up the ports they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="153.65" dur="4.1">buying up different natural resources in</text>
  <text start="156.17" dur="4.26">the country for pennies on the dollar</text>
  <text start="157.75" dur="4.959">basically they&amp;#39;re robbing the country</text>
  <text start="160.43" dur="4.11">this is what central bankers do they</text>
  <text start="162.709" dur="5.191">load the country&amp;#39;s up with debt</text>
  <text start="164.54" dur="6.3">they swoop on in and basically they take</text>
  <text start="167.9" dur="4.14">whatever they want and this is what</text>
  <text start="170.84" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="172.04" dur="6.779">now now throughout Europe we are</text>
  <text start="175.67" dur="4.709">realizing that the economies in each one</text>
  <text start="178.819" dur="3.691">of these countries now each one is</text>
  <text start="180.379" dur="4.86">different I mean we have Greece and</text>
  <text start="182.51" dur="4.47">Cyprus they&amp;#39;re doing terribly so is</text>
  <text start="185.239" dur="4.771">Italy so as France so it&amp;#39;s Portugal so</text>
  <text start="186.98" dur="4.44">Spain and other countries are on their</text>
  <text start="190.01" dur="3.8">way but each one is at a different level</text>
  <text start="191.42" dur="8.28">but when we look at eurozone as a whole</text>
  <text start="193.81" dur="10">they are continually pushing stimulus to</text>
  <text start="199.7" dur="6.319">fix the problem and guess what it is not</text>
  <text start="203.81" dur="4.879">working as we discussed before</text>
  <text start="206.019" dur="7.33">manufacturing and the service sector</text>
  <text start="208.689" dur="8.23">they are both slowing this is the lowest</text>
  <text start="213.349" dur="6.57">rate in four months and from everything</text>
  <text start="216.919" dur="7.951">that the ECB is trying to do it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="219.919" dur="7.02">going to work it creates bubbles it</text>
  <text start="224.87" dur="4.92">makes it look like things are getting</text>
  <text start="226.939" dur="5.19">better but in reality everything</text>
  <text start="229.79" dur="5.069">continually gets worse here in the</text>
  <text start="232.129" dur="5.431">States what are we saying well we are</text>
  <text start="234.859" dur="8.181">seeing the initial jobless claims we are</text>
  <text start="237.56" dur="8.549">definitely in a trend moving upward</text>
  <text start="243.04" dur="5.97">everything changed course around</text>
  <text start="246.109" dur="5.97">September of 2015 and ever since</text>
  <text start="249.01" dur="5.71">everyone now is filing for initial</text>
  <text start="252.079" dur="3.63">jobless claims now why is this well it</text>
  <text start="254.72" dur="3.449">looks like it&amp;#39;s getting harder and</text>
  <text start="255.709" dur="6.02">harder to manipulate these numbers but</text>
  <text start="258.169" dur="6.151">we are seeing more and more layoffs</text>
  <text start="261.729" dur="4.481">retail stores are closing laying off</text>
  <text start="264.32" dur="4.409">people corporations are laying off</text>
  <text start="266.21" dur="8.85">people credit Swiss they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="268.729" dur="9.87">cutting 4,000 jobs shell confirms 10,000</text>
  <text start="275.06" dur="6">people are going to be laid off so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="278.599" dur="4.921">getting a report in from challenger gray</text>
  <text start="281.06" dur="6.09">because as we know as of 2013 the</text>
  <text start="283.52" dur="6.619">department that basically collected all</text>
  <text start="287.15" dur="7.62">the data on what layoffs there are that</text>
  <text start="290.139" dur="7.87">department was kind of removed because</text>
  <text start="294.77" dur="5.209">of budget cuts so we have a private</text>
  <text start="298.009" dur="6.03">bini that&amp;#39;s looking at this and</text>
  <text start="299.979" dur="8.321">Challenger Gray said the first month of</text>
  <text start="304.039" dur="9.15">2016 which us-based employers reported</text>
  <text start="308.3" dur="6.69">about 75,000 114 plan job cuts this was</text>
  <text start="313.189" dur="6.63">a two hundred and eighteen percent</text>
  <text start="314.99" dur="8.729">increase from December and if we go back</text>
  <text start="319.819" dur="10.38">one year the same month it&amp;#39;s forty-two</text>
  <text start="323.719" dur="9.81">percent higher so we are looking at this</text>
  <text start="330.199" dur="8.46">entire situation and it is getting worse</text>
  <text start="333.529" dur="7.94">and worse as we move forward according</text>
  <text start="338.659" dur="5.82">to challenger we&amp;#39;re seeing heavy</text>
  <text start="341.469" dur="6.7">downsizing in the retail and energy</text>
  <text start="344.479" dur="7.951">sectors January was the largest total</text>
  <text start="348.169" dur="7.95">since 240 1749 job cuts were announced</text>
  <text start="352.43" dur="8.69">during the first month of 2009 retailers</text>
  <text start="356.119" dur="9.241">announced fifty 3968 planned layoffs</text>
  <text start="361.12" dur="6.699">what are we looking at here well we are</text>
  <text start="365.36" dur="5.94">seeing that this entire economy right</text>
  <text start="367.819" dur="4.861">now is collapsing right in front of it</text>
  <text start="371.3" dur="4.019">right in front of our eyes and every</text>
  <text start="372.68" dur="6.12">time we report on this it gets worse and</text>
  <text start="375.319" dur="6.75">worse as we move along it is not getting</text>
  <text start="378.8" dur="5.039">better at all and this is only going to</text>
  <text start="382.069" dur="3.77">accelerate because what all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="383.839" dur="3.75">the economy is going to start producing</text>
  <text start="385.839" dur="5.281">manufacturers are going to pick up</text>
  <text start="387.589" dur="8.37">retail stores are going to reopen no</text>
  <text start="391.12" dur="9.129">we&amp;#39;re going to see none of this this</text>
  <text start="395.959" dur="6.45">trend is downward the trend is layoffs</text>
  <text start="400.249" dur="4.861">the trend is there are no sales the</text>
  <text start="402.409" dur="7.05">trend is no one&amp;#39;s purchasing the trend</text>
  <text start="405.11" dur="6.269">is manufacturing is dead the trend is</text>
  <text start="409.459" dur="4.23">the Baltic Dry Index is continually</text>
  <text start="411.379" dur="8.01">decreasing because there is no demand</text>
  <text start="413.689" dur="9.15">right now that is the trend factory</text>
  <text start="419.389" dur="7.38">orders right now they have tumbled by</text>
  <text start="422.839" dur="6.12">two-point-nine percent in December this</text>
  <text start="426.769" dur="5.091">is the biggest month-on-month drop since</text>
  <text start="428.959" dur="5.531">december of 2014</text>
  <text start="431.86" dur="8.72">this is the 14 monthly drop in</text>
  <text start="434.49" dur="10">year-on-year factory orders and this is</text>
  <text start="440.58" dur="7.269">something that has not happened outside</text>
  <text start="444.49" dur="5.489">of a US economic recession so for all</text>
  <text start="447.849" dur="6.87">intents and purposes we are in a</text>
  <text start="449.979" dur="6.93">recession / depression right now and of</text>
  <text start="454.719" dur="3.241">course no one will admit to it the</text>
  <text start="456.909" dur="2.79">government&amp;#39;s not going to come out and</text>
  <text start="457.96" dur="4.53">say yes we are in a recession /</text>
  <text start="459.699" dur="5.49">depression because they&amp;#39;ve been pushing</text>
  <text start="462.49" dur="5.22">the idea that we&amp;#39;ve recovered so they</text>
  <text start="465.189" dur="4.771">just can&amp;#39;t come out and say yeah yeah we</text>
  <text start="467.71" dur="4.29">reversed and we&amp;#39;re back now they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="469.96" dur="4.38">do that the Fed just increased the</text>
  <text start="472" dur="3.689">interest rates they can&amp;#39;t come out and</text>
  <text start="474.34" dur="3.629">say okay the economy just went into</text>
  <text start="475.689" dur="5.85">recession they&amp;#39;re not going to do it</text>
  <text start="477.969" dur="8.581">they are going to lie until the very end</text>
  <text start="481.539" dur="8.19">and even more concerning is the surge in</text>
  <text start="486.55" dur="6.179">inventories two shipments they are at</text>
  <text start="489.729" dur="7.5">cycle highs seen in two thousand and two</text>
  <text start="492.729" dur="8.731">thousand eight it&amp;#39;s just getting worse</text>
  <text start="497.229" dur="6.3">and worse as time goes on and we should</text>
  <text start="501.46" dur="4.199">all be concerned at this point of what</text>
  <text start="503.529" dur="3.63">is happening here because we&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="505.659" dur="6.301">seeing the economy start to accelerate</text>
  <text start="507.159" dur="6.99">in a downward fashion now I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="511.96" dur="3.54">this will be a problem here and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="514.149" dur="3.961">probably nothing really to look at but</text>
  <text start="515.5" dur="4.949">truck January truck orders they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="518.11" dur="5.58">collapsed by forty-eight percent the</text>
  <text start="520.449" dur="6.841">trucking industry is declining rapidly</text>
  <text start="523.69" dur="5.49">and we understand why because there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="527.29" dur="3.539">demand people are losing their jobs</text>
  <text start="529.18" dur="3.779">people aren&amp;#39;t making the money they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="530.829" dur="3.63">getting laid off they&amp;#39;re not going out</text>
  <text start="532.959" dur="3.301">to the retail stores so the retail</text>
  <text start="534.459" dur="3">stores are closing since the retail</text>
  <text start="536.26" dur="2.91">stores are closing they&amp;#39;re laying off</text>
  <text start="537.459" dur="5.87">more people more people are out of work</text>
  <text start="539.17" dur="6.27">so they apply for unemployment insurance</text>
  <text start="543.329" dur="5.231">so we&amp;#39;re seeing the initial jobless</text>
  <text start="545.44" dur="4.68">claims move upward and since all this</text>
  <text start="548.56" dur="3.779">has happened guess what manufacturers</text>
  <text start="550.12" dur="3.63">don&amp;#39;t have to produce there&amp;#39;s no factory</text>
  <text start="552.339" dur="3.471">orders since they don&amp;#39;t have to produce</text>
  <text start="553.75" dur="4.05">guess what the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="555.81" dur="4">continually Falls because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="557.8" dur="5.49">need the raw materials to create any</text>
  <text start="559.81" dur="5.93">type of goods out there and the trucks</text>
  <text start="563.29" dur="6.33">they&amp;#39;re not delivering anything</text>
  <text start="565.74" dur="8.74">the rail traffic has gone down but right</text>
  <text start="569.62" dur="10.35">now us trucking has not been this bad</text>
  <text start="574.48" dur="7.859">since the financial crisis I mean we</text>
  <text start="579.97" dur="4.739">looked back in November when we reported</text>
  <text start="582.339" dur="5.341">on this that class eight trucking net</text>
  <text start="584.709" dur="6.781">orders they were fifty nine percent</text>
  <text start="587.68" dur="7.769">below a year ago and the lowest since</text>
  <text start="591.49" dur="7.89">sep tember 2012 and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="595.449" dur="8.211">right now is that this is continually</text>
  <text start="599.38" dur="7.29">declining the trucking industry says it</text>
  <text start="603.66" dur="5.77">is not looking good for this year it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="606.67" dur="4.8">not going to be a strong year trucking</text>
  <text start="609.43" dur="6.089">companies right now have been holding</text>
  <text start="611.47" dur="5.309">back on buying new models because</text>
  <text start="615.519" dur="3.781">they&amp;#39;re looking at the situation and</text>
  <text start="616.779" dur="4.711">they&amp;#39;re realizing things are starting to</text>
  <text start="619.3" dur="3.899">fall apart actually we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="621.49" dur="5.82">lots of layoffs in the trucking industry</text>
  <text start="623.199" dur="6.241">and we&amp;#39;re going to see problems in that</text>
  <text start="627.31" dur="4.29">industry just like we&amp;#39;ve been seeing it</text>
  <text start="629.44" dur="6.199">in every single one of these industries</text>
  <text start="631.6" dur="7.41">and it&amp;#39;s just going to get worse I mean</text>
  <text start="635.639" dur="6.64">when we look at this and we look at the</text>
  <text start="639.01" dur="8.49">entire financial picture here what are</text>
  <text start="642.279" dur="7.771">we seeing we are seeing every sector of</text>
  <text start="647.5" dur="5.97">the economy is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="650.05" dur="4.62">yes they can manipulate certain areas to</text>
  <text start="653.47" dur="2.82">make it look good and I know those</text>
  <text start="654.67" dur="3.69">people are out there saying see this one</text>
  <text start="656.29" dur="5.88">little area it&amp;#39;s still good but guess</text>
  <text start="658.36" dur="5.729">what it doesn&amp;#39;t matter they can</text>
  <text start="662.17" dur="4.07">manipulate it all they want eventually</text>
  <text start="664.089" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s not even going to make sense I</text>
  <text start="666.24" dur="4.69">remember a year ago when we were all</text>
  <text start="669.279" dur="3.721">reporting on this people were setting</text>
  <text start="670.93" dur="4.32">the emails about everything saying yes I</text>
  <text start="673" dur="5.01">see this downturn I see that and people</text>

  <text start="678.01" dur="6.09">it&amp;#39;s spreading now it&amp;#39;s getting worse in</text>
  <text start="681.01" dur="5.519">every single sector people are starting</text>
  <text start="684.1" dur="5.88">to realize there is a problem in this</text>
  <text start="686.529" dur="6.961">economy it&amp;#39;s either the data that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="689.98" dur="6.539">talking about it&amp;#39;s not true or the</text>

  <text start="741.61" dur="6.42">Americans and it seems that they have no</text>
  <text start="744.91" dur="6.09">clue or know nothing about their student</text>
  <text start="748.03" dur="5.88">loans whatsoever seven out of ten</text>
  <text start="751" dur="5.37">college graduates are leaving school</text>
  <text start="753.91" dur="4.88">with student loans to pay back and this</text>
  <text start="756.37" dur="5.34">new poll shows that these young people</text>
  <text start="758.79" dur="6.37">have a very low level of knowledge about</text>
  <text start="761.71" dur="5.28">the debt that they owe eight percent of</text>
  <text start="765.16" dur="4.38">those interviewed surveyed know the</text>
  <text start="766.99" dur="6.3">current interest rates on their loans</text>
  <text start="769.54" dur="6.62">and six percent only know how long it</text>
  <text start="773.29" dur="4.89">will take to make the repayments</text>
  <text start="776.16" dur="4.69">fifty-nine percent of the students</text>
  <text start="778.18" dur="6.03">believe that Americans in total only</text>
  <text start="780.85" dur="7.08">about a million or so dollars in student</text>
  <text start="784.21" dur="6.54">debt the actual figure of what all the</text>
  <text start="787.93" dur="6.93">students Oh together is about 1.3</text>
  <text start="790.75" dur="8.37">trillion so many of these people they</text>
  <text start="794.86" dur="8.16">have no idea how much they owe what</text>
  <text start="799.12" dur="6">their payments are going to be and as we</text>
  <text start="803.02" dur="5.7">know the government right now they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="805.12" dur="5.22">modified everything because they realize</text>
  <text start="808.72" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re not finding the jobs they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="810.34" dur="5.16">getting the income so the student loans</text>
  <text start="812.95" dur="4.7">are based off the income that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="815.5" dur="5.1">receiving so if you have a part-time job</text>
  <text start="817.65" dur="4.87">they readjust your payments they spread</text>
  <text start="820.6" dur="4.56">them out over a long longer period of</text>
  <text start="822.52" dur="4.83">time and it might take someone 15-20</text>
  <text start="825.16" dur="6.32">years to pay it back depending on how</text>
  <text start="827.35" dur="6.83">much you owe and we can see that</text>
  <text start="831.48" dur="5.07">the US government central bankers they</text>
  <text start="834.18" dur="4.38">are trying to inflate these bubbles they</text>
  <text start="836.55" dur="3.75">realize the American people are tapped</text>
  <text start="838.56" dur="4.23">out right now they&amp;#39;re losing their jobs</text>
  <text start="840.3" dur="4.95">and the only way to inflate these</text>
  <text start="842.79" dur="4.53">bubbles is to bring in more people into</text>
  <text start="845.25" dur="5.22">the country they need more of these</text>
  <text start="847.32" dur="7.11">people to inflate the auto loan bubble</text>
  <text start="850.47" dur="9.54">the student loan bubble the housing</text>
  <text start="854.43" dur="7.98">bubble this is all they have left they</text>
  <text start="860.01" dur="5.129">can modify loans they can make it easier</text>
  <text start="862.41" dur="5.76">for people but it&amp;#39;d be easier for people</text>
  <text start="865.139" dur="6">to get loans but after a while you run</text>
  <text start="868.17" dur="6.359">out of these people the amount of people</text>
  <text start="871.139" dur="6.991">is finite so they have to bring more in</text>
  <text start="874.529" dur="5.61">from other places and now you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="878.13" dur="5.519">starting to see the picture of why they</text>
  <text start="880.139" dur="5.601">want these illegals in here and why they</text>
  <text start="883.649" dur="5.37">want them to come into the country</text>
  <text start="885.74" dur="8.289">because it allows them to expand the</text>
  <text start="889.019" dur="8.791">debt bubbles we see the TPP we know that</text>
  <text start="894.029" dur="5.55">12 countries sign it they still have to</text>
  <text start="897.81" dur="5.43">ratify it same thing here in the United</text>
  <text start="899.579" dur="5.13">States it was more of more propaganda to</text>
  <text start="903.24" dur="5.25">let everyone know that everyone is in on</text>
  <text start="904.709" dur="8.761">this but in New Zealand huge protests</text>
  <text start="908.49" dur="8.07">out there and New Zealand formally</text>
  <text start="913.47" dur="5.16">signed the free trade agreement and the</text>
  <text start="916.56" dur="5.399">people are saying no we do not want this</text>
  <text start="918.63" dur="7.949">and many of the people out there are</text>
  <text start="921.959" dur="9.031">saying we do not want the TPP but the</text>
  <text start="926.579" dur="8.611">president is out there saying listen we</text>
  <text start="930.99" dur="9.3">need to ratify the TPP today this year</text>
  <text start="935.19" dur="7.32">we can&amp;#39;t wait now why is he pushing so</text>
  <text start="940.29" dur="5.7">hard is this going to create incredible</text>
  <text start="942.51" dur="6.41">jobs for the people no it will bring in</text>
  <text start="945.99" dur="7.709">foreign workers into this country and</text>
  <text start="948.92" dur="7.149">again the manufacturers the corporations</text>
  <text start="953.699" dur="4.44">will only have to pay them the going</text>
  <text start="956.069" dur="4.38">rate of their country which will make it</text>
  <text start="958.139" dur="3.621">hard for the American people but they</text>
  <text start="960.449" dur="4.561">don&amp;#39;t care about the American people</text>
  <text start="961.76" dur="7.03">what do they want they want</text>
  <text start="965.01" dur="6.87">Shh new people in the country because if</text>
  <text start="968.79" dur="5.49">they come over here and they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="971.88" dur="4.02">guess what they&amp;#39;re going to do I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="974.28" dur="4.11">to need a car so we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="975.9" dur="4.35">take out an old alone they might go back</text>
  <text start="978.39" dur="6.9">to school so they&amp;#39;ll take out a student</text>
  <text start="980.25" dur="11.03">loan they will maybe purchase a house if</text>
  <text start="985.29" dur="8.61">it&amp;#39;s possible and this will allow the</text>
  <text start="991.28" dur="7.06">central bankers to continually push</text>
  <text start="993.9" dur="5.58">their debt larger and larger and of</text>
  <text start="998.34" dur="4.41">course we know there&amp;#39;s many other</text>
  <text start="999.48" dur="4.71">agendas associated with the TPP but we</text>
  <text start="1002.75" dur="5.91">can see how all this is playing into</text>
  <text start="1004.19" dur="9.03">each other and it&amp;#39;s getting worse now</text>
  <text start="1008.66" dur="8.76">our students are young children who are</text>
  <text start="1013.22" dur="5.85">going to school we know that they</text>
  <text start="1017.42" dur="4.2">implemented Common Core in many of the</text>
  <text start="1019.07" dur="5.82">states which is not helping the students</text>
  <text start="1021.62" dur="5.459">whatsoever just like No Child Left</text>
  <text start="1024.89" dur="5.48">Behind didn&amp;#39;t do anything for the</text>
  <text start="1027.079" dur="6.691">children and now we have proof of this</text>
  <text start="1030.37" dur="5.62">there is a new report which was released</text>
  <text start="1033.77" dur="6.65">by the network for public education they</text>
  <text start="1035.99" dur="8.49">npe they evaluated schools on a</text>
  <text start="1040.42" dur="8.23">six-point system and they went around</text>
  <text start="1044.48" dur="6.18">the country to all 50 states and these</text>
  <text start="1048.65" dur="5.24">points included resistance to</text>
  <text start="1050.66" dur="7.17">privatization professionalization of</text>
  <text start="1053.89" dur="5.92">teaching school finance allocation of</text>
  <text start="1057.83" dur="5.9">taxpayer resources reliance on</text>
  <text start="1059.81" dur="6.15">high-stakes testing and academic success</text>
  <text start="1063.73" dur="5.05">so they looked at all these points and</text>
  <text start="1065.96" dur="7.08">they started giving grades out well</text>
  <text start="1068.78" dur="9.9">guess what the grades were seized D&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1073.04" dur="10.05">and F&amp;#39;s I mean this is absolutely awful</text>
  <text start="1078.68" dur="9.03">and in their report they noted something</text>
  <text start="1083.09" dur="7.26">very specific of why this happened the</text>
  <text start="1087.71" dur="5.52">report noted that policies and laws</text>
  <text start="1090.35" dur="4.02">enacted by States of course they were</text>
  <text start="1093.23" dur="4.02">forced to do this by the federal</text>
  <text start="1094.37" dur="4.96">government because if they didn&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="1097.25" dur="6.05">they wouldn&amp;#39;t receive the funds</text>
  <text start="1099.33" dur="8.88">was from the implementation of the No</text>
  <text start="1103.3" dur="7.11">Child Left Behind Act this has</text>
  <text start="1108.21" dur="3.85">significantly downgraded the quality of</text>
  <text start="1110.41" dur="5.85">education in the public school system</text>
  <text start="1112.06" dur="6.9">and looking forward the common core</text>
  <text start="1116.26" dur="5.55">system is going to bring the school</text>
  <text start="1118.96" dur="5.67">system down even further remember</text>
  <text start="1121.81" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re implementing a program where</text>
  <text start="1124.63" dur="5.31">they have no proof of it that it that</text>
  <text start="1127.42" dur="5.49">it&amp;#39;s going to work at all they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1129.94" dur="4.23">telling us it&amp;#39;s going to work but from</text>
  <text start="1132.91" dur="4.5">the evidence that we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="1134.17" dur="5.46">we&amp;#39;ve noticed that no it&amp;#39;s not and if</text>
  <text start="1137.41" dur="4.77">you want to hear more about this you can</text>
  <text start="1139.63" dur="4.68">go to the x 22 report spotlight i did an</text>
  <text start="1142.18" dur="4.68">interview with dr. duke pesta you can</text>
  <text start="1144.31" dur="6.03">look for that interview and he explains</text>
  <text start="1146.86" dur="8.33">the entire common core of why it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1150.34" dur="7.92">going to work and how it was created and</text>
  <text start="1155.19" dur="7.42">we see right now they&amp;#39;re doing this on</text>
  <text start="1158.26" dur="8.42">purpose it&amp;#39;s to dumb down the American</text>
  <text start="1162.61" dur="7.59">people because as they passed the TPP</text>
  <text start="1166.68" dur="5.68">bring in foreign workers the foreign</text>
  <text start="1170.2" dur="5.81">workers are receiving the pay from their</text>
  <text start="1172.36" dur="5.97">country the American people cannot work</text>
  <text start="1176.01" dur="5.04">manufacturing has left the country</text>
  <text start="1178.33" dur="5.28">high-paying jobs have left the country</text>
  <text start="1181.05" dur="6.37">they only want to educate the people at</text>
  <text start="1183.61" dur="9.29">a certain level this is what the elite</text>
  <text start="1187.42" dur="8.85">are doing and they&amp;#39;re pushing this as</text>
  <text start="1192.9" dur="5.95">hard as they possibly can and if you</text>
  <text start="1196.27" dur="4.59">notice every time the government the</text>
  <text start="1198.85" dur="5.1">federal government sticks their hands</text>
  <text start="1200.86" dur="4.98">into something and tries to make it</text>
  <text start="1203.95" dur="7.4">better or tells us they&amp;#39;re making it</text>
  <text start="1205.84" dur="9.69">better it only seems to get worse and</text>
  <text start="1211.35" dur="7.02">it&amp;#39;s just a fact it never gets better</text>
  <text start="1215.53" dur="7.98">and this is why the founding fathers</text>
  <text start="1218.37" dur="8.38">wanted people in communities at a local</text>
  <text start="1223.51" dur="6.75">level to decide for their children what</text>
  <text start="1226.75" dur="6.21">type of education and everything else</text>
  <text start="1230.26" dur="6.6">that is surrounding their community</text>
  <text start="1232.96" dur="5.06">what they wanted them to do there they</text>
  <text start="1236.86" dur="4.62">didn&amp;#39;t want the federal government</text>
  <text start="1238.02" dur="6.31">coming in and saying this is best for</text>
  <text start="1241.48" dur="5.09">you no because as we know the local</text>
  <text start="1244.33" dur="5.49">communities the parents of the community</text>
  <text start="1246.57" dur="6.79">know what&amp;#39;s best for their children they</text>
  <text start="1249.82" dur="5.25">know it&amp;#39;s best for their town and this</text>
  <text start="1253.36" dur="2.97">is why the founding fathers created the</text>
  <text start="1255.07" dur="3.03">system the way it is but the federal</text>
  <text start="1256.33" dur="3.329">government is overreaching right now</text>
  <text start="1258.1" dur="4.829">because they want control of everything</text>
  <text start="1259.659" dur="7.38">and this is why they bribe the state&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1262.929" dur="7.771">the city&amp;#39;s the town&amp;#39;s with money to get</text>
  <text start="1267.039" dur="8.151">their way if you want Common Core which</text>
  <text start="1270.7" dur="7.74">sounds great then you have to accept the</text>
  <text start="1275.19" dur="6.459">No Child Left Behind and we will give</text>
  <text start="1278.44" dur="7.339">you money for that as long as you accept</text>
  <text start="1281.649" dur="7.711">common core and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="1285.779" dur="5.471">this is all part of their master plan</text>
