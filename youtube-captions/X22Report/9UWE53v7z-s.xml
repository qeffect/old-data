  <text start="171.709" dur="4.681">for people and many people said you know</text>
  <text start="174.11" dur="4.98">something we don&amp;#39;t need as many gifts</text>
  <text start="176.39" dur="4.83">this holiday season one because we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="179.09" dur="4.799">have the same job or we have a part-time</text>
  <text start="181.22" dur="4.71">job or we have no job and we see right</text>
  <text start="183.889" dur="2.971">now that the retail industry is taking a</text>
  <text start="185.93" dur="3.27">huge hit</text>
  <text start="186.86" dur="3.75">the real estate industry is taking a</text>
  <text start="189.2" dur="3.18">huge hit we&amp;#39;re starting to see prices</text>
  <text start="190.61" dur="4.38">come down the bubbles are popping in</text>
  <text start="192.38" dur="4.98">different areas traffic&amp;#39;s drying up we</text>

  <text start="199.25" dur="6.72">estate it&amp;#39;s starting to hit everywhere</text>
  <text start="202.37" dur="4.89">and it&amp;#39;s going to snowball as we move</text>
  <text start="205.97" dur="5.01">forward now the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="207.26" dur="6.18">starting to recognize that the economy</text>
  <text start="210.98" dur="4.35">is not doing well now this was the this</text>
  <text start="213.44" dur="3.87">is all being done on purpose and this</text>
  <text start="215.33" dur="3.72">was part of their plan was to make sure</text>
  <text start="217.31" dur="3.87">that Trump was in office for a certain</text>
  <text start="219.05" dur="3.48">period of time then start to turn</text>
  <text start="221.18" dur="3.42">everything around saying that the</text>
  <text start="222.53" dur="5.12">economy is not doing well well we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="224.6" dur="6.63">known that the economy has never</text>
  <text start="227.65" dur="6.09">recovered it&amp;#39;s never repaired itself the</text>
  <text start="231.23" dur="6.229">central banks well all they did was</text>
  <text start="233.74" dur="6.67">create currency prop up the banks and</text>
  <text start="237.459" dur="4.601">made themselves very very wealthy that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="240.41" dur="4.86">all that has been done we see right now</text>
  <text start="242.06" dur="4.95">that the dodd-frank provision well it</text>
  <text start="245.27" dur="4.35">looks like it&amp;#39;s going to be overturned</text>
  <text start="247.01" dur="5.66">it has cleared the Senate and we can see</text>
  <text start="249.62" dur="7.14">right now that we might be going and</text>
  <text start="252.67" dur="7.48">repeating what has happened back in 2008</text>
  <text start="256.76" dur="6.33">now prior to that they repealed the</text>
  <text start="260.15" dur="5.28">glass-steagall Act this was Bill Clinton</text>
  <text start="263.09" dur="4.5">who did this and it only took a couple</text>
  <text start="265.43" dur="3.72">of years before the whole system</text>
  <text start="267.59" dur="6.09">completely fell apart because it allowed</text>
  <text start="269.15" dur="7.8">banks to basically deal in risky assets</text>
  <text start="273.68" dur="6.9">and we can see right now we&amp;#39;re headed to</text>
  <text start="276.95" dur="4.95">the same exact thing where now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="280.58" dur="3.21">getting rid of the protection of the</text>
  <text start="281.9" dur="3.48">dodd-frank act even though there are</text>
  <text start="283.79" dur="4.02">some people saying that this is not a</text>
  <text start="285.38" dur="3.03">protection it we&amp;#39;d be better off without</text>
  <text start="287.81" dur="3.93">it</text>
  <text start="288.41" dur="6.45">but at this stage of the game it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="291.74" dur="6.06">going to bring down the entire system</text>
  <text start="294.86" dur="6.5">now remember there is a battle going on</text>
  <text start="297.8" dur="4.71">between Trump and the central banking</text>
  <text start="301.36" dur="3.28">institution</text>
  <text start="302.51" dur="5.37">the Federal Reserve the Rothschild</text>
  <text start="304.64" dur="6.839">banking system and we can see that Trump</text>
  <text start="307.88" dur="6.51">right now is pushing his agenda with</text>
  <text start="311.479" dur="5.701">tariffs starting what they call trade</text>
  <text start="314.39" dur="5.85">wars but what he is doing is he is</text>
  <text start="317.18" dur="3.44">undoing everything the central bank the</text>
  <text start="320.24" dur="2.57">deeps</text>
  <text start="320.62" dur="4.91">is put into place over the many many</text>
  <text start="322.81" dur="5.669">years like NAFTA the World Trade</text>
  <text start="325.53" dur="7.18">Organization and their deals they got</text>
  <text start="328.479" dur="7.081">rid of TPP he has to do this so it can</text>
  <text start="332.71" dur="5.58">allow the United States to survive after</text>
  <text start="335.56" dur="5.52">this whole thing resets and what this</text>
  <text start="338.29" dur="5.129">tells me is that he&amp;#39;s dismantling all of</text>
  <text start="341.08" dur="3.78">this and then he&amp;#39;s going to go after the</text>
  <text start="343.419" dur="4.56">central bank and get rid of the central</text>
  <text start="344.86" dur="5.49">bank now we see right now he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="347.979" dur="3.901">that he would like to get rid of NAFTA</text>
  <text start="350.35" dur="4.47">like he said he was going to do he</text>
  <text start="351.88" dur="5.46">rather have bilateral trade deals with</text>
  <text start="354.82" dur="5.51">different countries instead of this</text>
  <text start="357.34" dur="5.1">globalist version where everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="360.33" dur="4.149">trading with each other and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="362.44" dur="4.5">controlled this is what the central</text>
  <text start="364.479" dur="4.47">bankers wanted he doesn&amp;#39;t want this now</text>
  <text start="366.94" dur="4.949">it&amp;#39;s very interesting about all this is</text>
  <text start="368.949" dur="3.241">he&amp;#39;s going after one of these things at</text>
  <text start="371.889" dur="3.511">a time</text>
  <text start="372.19" dur="5.61">TPP canceled that then it was NAFTA then</text>
  <text start="375.4" dur="6.53">it was tariffs and it was our reciprocal</text>
  <text start="377.8" dur="8.67">taxes now he&amp;#39;s going after Germany and</text>
  <text start="381.93" dur="6.88">trade war with Germany well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="386.47" dur="7.879">saying this could damage the global</text>
  <text start="388.81" dur="8.88">recovery there is no global recovery</text>
  <text start="394.349" dur="6.311">this is an illusion that they created</text>
  <text start="397.69" dur="5.159">that the economies are doing better that</text>
  <text start="400.66" dur="5.16">we&amp;#39;re in this recovery and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="402.849" dur="5.911">saying that Trump putting forth these</text>
  <text start="405.82" dur="4.74">tariffs on metal imports is going to</text>
  <text start="408.76" dur="3.779">start a trade war especially with</text>
  <text start="410.56" dur="2.639">Germany because that&amp;#39;s where he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="412.539" dur="4.88">next</text>
  <text start="413.199" dur="9.211">and this is all part of his strategy</text>
  <text start="417.419" dur="9.06">think about why the central bankers have</text>
  <text start="422.41" dur="7.14">the ability to keep the illusion</text>
  <text start="426.479" dur="5.47">continuing on for many many years</text>
  <text start="429.55" dur="4.44">because they put into place they had</text>
  <text start="431.949" dur="5.4">government&amp;#39;s put into place all these</text>
  <text start="433.99" dur="6.78">laws which allow them to keep the</text>
  <text start="437.349" dur="7.921">illusion alive when you start removing</text>
  <text start="440.77" dur="8.97">their protection laws and you start to</text>
  <text start="445.27" dur="8.37">expose them what happens the truth comes</text>
  <text start="449.74" dur="4.7">out and we can see this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="453.64" dur="4.31">is being done</text>
  <text start="454.44" dur="5.28">now the central bankers they want to</text>
  <text start="457.95" dur="3">control the economy they want to bring</text>
  <text start="459.72" dur="3.57">it down in their way they want to</text>
  <text start="460.95" dur="4.14">control the narrative Trump is doing the</text>
  <text start="463.29" dur="4.8">same exact thing and he&amp;#39;s pushing</text>
  <text start="465.09" dur="4.77">everything to the edge this is why the</text>
  <text start="468.09" dur="5.39">central banks are out there</text>
  <text start="469.86" dur="7.26">Germany is out there the EU is out there</text>
  <text start="473.48" dur="6.97">anyone that is with the globalists</text>
  <text start="477.12" dur="6.06">they&amp;#39;re all out there saying what Trump</text>
  <text start="480.45" dur="5.55">is doing he&amp;#39;s going to hurt the global</text>
  <text start="483.18" dur="5.01">recovery there is no global recovery</text>
  <text start="486" dur="5.88">what they&amp;#39;re really saying is what he is</text>
  <text start="488.19" dur="8.16">doing he&amp;#39;s going to hurt the globalist</text>
  <text start="491.88" dur="7.17">agenda that&amp;#39;s exactly what he wants to</text>
  <text start="496.35" dur="4.35">do and the central banks they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="499.05" dur="4.44">worried about all of this they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="500.7" dur="4.5">worried about crypto currencies they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="503.49" dur="4.89">worried about these tariffs they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="505.2" dur="5.31">worried about dismantling NAFTA and all</text>
  <text start="508.38" dur="4.38">their other trade deals they&amp;#39;re worried</text>
  <text start="510.51" dur="4.29">about the United States having bilateral</text>
  <text start="512.76" dur="3.959">trade deals around the world remember</text>
  <text start="514.8" dur="4.65">once we stop becoming the reserve</text>
  <text start="516.719" dur="5.851">currency of the world we&amp;#39;re gonna we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="519.45" dur="5.73">going to need a mechanism to have trade</text>
  <text start="522.57" dur="5.91">and this is what is being set up right</text>
  <text start="525.18" dur="7.41">now he&amp;#39;s pushing this forth so we can</text>
  <text start="528.48" dur="6.24">have trade once the system resets now JP</text>
  <text start="532.59" dur="7.23">Morgan is out there and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="534.72" dur="8.1">that if Trump continues on with this</text>
  <text start="539.82" dur="6.84">trade war he will bring down and</text>
  <text start="542.82" dur="6.51">destabilize the markets and this opens a</text>
  <text start="546.66" dur="5.37">path to impeachment I mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="549.33" dur="6.68">trying everything in anything to get a</text>
  <text start="552.03" dur="8.03">man of office so if he too stabilizes</text>
  <text start="556.01" dur="6.19">the markets brings down the system</text>
  <text start="560.06" dur="5.71">they&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;re gonna go and</text>
  <text start="562.2" dur="5.61">try to impeach him you can see what is</text>
  <text start="565.77" dur="3.63">happening right now this battle that</text>
  <text start="567.81" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about between the</text>
  <text start="569.4" dur="5.1">central banks and between the Trump</text>
  <text start="572.07" dur="5.73">administration to get rid of the central</text>
  <text start="574.5" dur="6.15">banks it is real it is happening right</text>
  <text start="577.8" dur="6.42">in front of our faces and we can see</text>
  <text start="580.65" dur="6.51">both have fired their shots and Trump is</text>
  <text start="584.22" dur="3.87">continually firing his shots he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="587.16" dur="5.52">to continue</text>
  <text start="588.09" dur="8.61">until this system is brought down the</text>
  <text start="592.68" dur="7.56">central bankers are exposed and people</text>
  <text start="596.7" dur="6.42">realize that we don&amp;#39;t need a central</text>
  <text start="600.24" dur="7.41">banking system that&amp;#39;s what this is all</text>
  <text start="603.12" dur="9.03">about because again you need to cut off</text>
  <text start="607.65" dur="7.1">the funding of the deep state of the</text>
  <text start="612.15" dur="6.48">neocons the corrupt government officials</text>
  <text start="614.75" dur="6.31">you need to cut this off and the root of</text>
  <text start="618.63" dur="5.4">all this evil that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ll call it</text>
  <text start="621.06" dur="6.84">is coming from the central bank</text>
  <text start="624.03" dur="6.57">they&amp;#39;re the ones who fund all of this</text>
  <text start="627.9" dur="4.47">they push a button currency is now</text>
  <text start="630.6" dur="3.24">created out of thin air on a computer</text>
  <text start="632.37" dur="5.37">systems that are printing it with paper</text>
  <text start="633.84" dur="7.53">and ink and they can fund any other</text>
  <text start="637.74" dur="6.21">central bank any government any other</text>
  <text start="641.37" dur="6.69">individual to do what they want them to</text>
  <text start="643.95" dur="7.56">do and we need to remember that the</text>
  <text start="648.06" dur="5.82">central bank the whole system does not</text>
  <text start="651.51" dur="5.88">need to be put in place the way it is</text>
  <text start="653.88" dur="6.24">today there is no reason to have this</text>
  <text start="657.39" dur="5.19">system where they create currency out of</text>
  <text start="660.12" dur="5.7">thin air and they&amp;#39;ll own this currency</text>
  <text start="662.58" dur="6.12">with interest attached to governments it</text>
  <text start="665.82" dur="5.04">makes no sense the founding fathers of</text>
  <text start="668.7" dur="5.1">the United States they didn&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="670.86" dur="7.59">at all actually they fought against it</text>
  <text start="673.8" dur="7.35">Andrew Jackson got rid of the central</text>
  <text start="678.45" dur="7.11">banking system until it was reintroduced</text>
  <text start="681.15" dur="7.19">in 1913 and we&amp;#39;ve had it ever since but</text>
  <text start="685.56" dur="5.34">the whole reason was to get away from</text>
  <text start="688.34" dur="4.96">England get it get away from their</text>
  <text start="690.9" dur="4.68">central banking system get rid of get</text>
  <text start="693.3" dur="3.18">away from their control and this is what</text>
  <text start="695.58" dur="4.47">is happening right</text>
  <text start="696.48" dur="6.05">once again they understand the central</text>
  <text start="700.05" dur="5.61">banking system is the main problem</text>
  <text start="702.53" dur="6.46">that&amp;#39;s the problem that we are dealing</text>
  <text start="705.66" dur="6.48">with and many people those who are</text>
  <text start="708.99" dur="5.55">within the corrupt government those</text>
  <text start="712.14" dur="4.83">individuals that are not elected but are</text>
  <text start="714.54" dur="4.92">within all of this they like the central</text>
  <text start="716.97" dur="4.62">bank if you if you look at a lot of the</text>
  <text start="719.46" dur="4.74">politicians they go into government</text>
  <text start="721.59" dur="5.64">they might not be making that much money</text>
