  <text start="165.48" dur="5.91">talked about quite often and then we</text>
  <text start="167.55" dur="6.81">have the people side if people believe</text>
  <text start="171.39" dur="6.12">the statistics are showing the economies</text>
  <text start="174.36" dur="6.599">doing well people then have confidence</text>

  <text start="211.53" dur="5.49">manipulated this would backfire on them</text>
  <text start="213.87" dur="4.98">this is why they can&amp;#39;t touch it this is</text>

  <text start="230.459" dur="6.75">jobs they can&amp;#39;t look at the unemployment</text>
  <text start="232.44" dur="6.72">rate they&amp;#39;re stuck Trump the Patriots he</text>
  <text start="237.209" dur="5.131">has trapped them trapped the mainstream</text>
  <text start="239.16" dur="6.18">media trapped the establishment trapped</text>
  <text start="242.34" dur="6.48">the central bank they&amp;#39;re controlling it</text>
  <text start="245.34" dur="6.09">all he tweeted out the following the US</text>
  <text start="248.82" dur="4.919">economy is the envy of the world as</text>
  <text start="251.43" dur="4.92">Europe and Asia slide ever toward a</text>
  <text start="253.739" dur="4.68">recession but the left is trying to</text>
  <text start="256.35" dur="5.49">avoid talking points about the Trump</text>
  <text start="258.419" dur="5.701">economy the best is yet to come</text>
  <text start="261.84" dur="4.26">think about what he&amp;#39;s saying here the</text>
  <text start="264.12" dur="5.85">best is yet to come</text>
  <text start="266.1" dur="6.65">why is the best yet to come because once</text>
  <text start="269.97" dur="6.62">there&amp;#39;s another rate cut once</text>
  <text start="272.75" dur="6.51">stimulus starts he just reversed</text>
  <text start="276.59" dur="6.88">everything the deep state</text>
  <text start="279.26" dur="6.37">the central bank tried to do this is</text>
  <text start="283.47" dur="4.29">going to be a drug to the system it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.63" dur="5.43">going to shock the system and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="287.76" dur="5.19">gonna see incredible things happen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="291.06" dur="4.53">already seeing the market go up yes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="292.95" dur="6.54">down a little bit today not really a big</text>
  <text start="295.59" dur="7.5">deal think about where it is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="299.49" dur="6.09">hitting all-time new highs even if it</text>
  <text start="303.09" dur="4.77">hits or when it hits 30,000 and it comes</text>
  <text start="305.58" dur="4.95">down to 28,000 goes back up to 30,000</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s still at all-time new highs now I</text>
  <text start="310.53" dur="4.77">know the market has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="312.63" dur="6.39">the economy but remember the mainstream</text>
  <text start="315.3" dur="6.51">media the central bank for years they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="319.02" dur="4.38">been convincing us that that&amp;#39;s the gauge</text>
  <text start="321.81" dur="3">of the economy and again Trump is using</text>
  <text start="323.4" dur="4.889">this you have to put this into</text>
  <text start="324.81" dur="5.85">perspective of what he&amp;#39;s doing here now</text>
  <text start="328.289" dur="5.121">they tried to push the agenda that</text>
  <text start="330.66" dur="6.33">tariffs are going to ruin the economy</text>
  <text start="333.41" dur="6.759">that people are going to have to pay a</text>
  <text start="336.99" dur="5.73">lot more money for products and the</text>
  <text start="340.169" dur="4.591">everyday person it&amp;#39;s going to hurt them</text>
  <text start="342.72" dur="4.5">and they&amp;#39;re gonna be really upset and</text>
  <text start="344.76" dur="4.88">they&amp;#39;re gonna go after Trump this is</text>
  <text start="347.22" dur="5.699">what the establishment tried to do</text>
  <text start="349.64" dur="5.68">they&amp;#39;ve been pushing this out there for</text>
  <text start="352.919" dur="7.381">a very long time actually the Koch</text>
  <text start="355.32" dur="7.71">Network they&amp;#39;ve been pushing TV ads and</text>
  <text start="360.3" dur="4.83">they emphasized how Americans could</text>
  <text start="363.03" dur="5.58">experience financial pain from the</text>
  <text start="365.13" dur="6.39">tariff fight and how it wasn&amp;#39;t going to</text>
  <text start="368.61" dur="5.73">pan out for the everyday person this is</text>
  <text start="371.52" dur="6.81">the narrative they&amp;#39;ve been pushing since</text>
  <text start="374.34" dur="8.73">Trump introduced tariffs but guess what</text>
  <text start="378.33" dur="8.16">they realized that it didn&amp;#39;t work their</text>
  <text start="383.07" dur="5.88">entire agenda and this is coming from</text>
  <text start="386.49" dur="4.98">billionaire Charles Koch he&amp;#39;s saying we</text>
  <text start="388.95" dur="4.35">have to look for a new strategy what we</text>
  <text start="391.47" dur="5.58">tried to do with the trade war in</text>
  <text start="393.3" dur="5.429">tariffs against China it didn&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="397.05" dur="5.22">effect that we thought it was going to</text>
  <text start="398.729" dur="6.511">have so right there and then they tried</text>
  <text start="402.27" dur="6.51">to push a narrative an economic</text>
  <text start="405.24" dur="7.17">narrative that completely failed</text>
  <text start="408.78" dur="6.93">and guess what it&amp;#39;s a huge failure</text>
  <text start="412.41" dur="6.08">because that means they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="415.71" dur="7.29">ability to control the economic</text>
  <text start="418.49" dur="6.64">narrative they don&amp;#39;t have it why why</text>
  <text start="423" dur="3.92">don&amp;#39;t they have it because remember how</text>
  <text start="425.13" dur="4.56">tariffs are worked</text>
  <text start="426.92" dur="4.54">remember when china produces the product</text>
  <text start="429.69" dur="4.77">or another country produces a product</text>
  <text start="431.46" dur="5.94">the first wholesaler that picks it up</text>
  <text start="434.46" dur="6.17">they&amp;#39;re the ones who pay the tariff</text>
  <text start="437.4" dur="8.66">percentage and remember the cost of</text>
  <text start="440.63" dur="8.74">acquiring that item is not that much</text>
  <text start="446.06" dur="5.68">because when they produce it that TV or</text>
  <text start="449.37" dur="5.1">the iPhone is not a thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="451.74" dur="5.31">when they produce it it&amp;#39;s much much less</text>
  <text start="454.47" dur="4.199">so they&amp;#39;re paying it on that then it</text>
  <text start="457.05" dur="3.54">goes to another hotel another wholesaler</text>
  <text start="458.669" dur="4.641">and eventually it reaches the United</text>
  <text start="460.59" dur="6.65">States and by the time it reaches here</text>
  <text start="463.31" dur="7.359">nobody sees it at all it&amp;#39;s a wash</text>
  <text start="467.24" dur="4.87">companies might feel the pain this is</text>
  <text start="470.669" dur="4.261">why they&amp;#39;re B this is why they&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="472.11" dur="5.85">out of China but the everyday person</text>
  <text start="474.93" dur="4.44">they don&amp;#39;t really realize that anything</text>
  <text start="477.96" dur="5.36">really happened you know what people</text>
  <text start="479.37" dur="7.47">realize they realize when the dollar</text>
  <text start="483.32" dur="5.71">continually loses value over a period of</text>
  <text start="486.84" dur="4.53">time and you have to pay more for food</text>
  <text start="489.03" dur="4.05">and I&amp;#39;m talking about fresh fruit I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="491.37" dur="3.84">not talking about the can chemical food</text>
  <text start="493.08" dur="4.47">where they can keep the prices down if</text>
  <text start="495.21" dur="4.459">you look at meat if you look at fresh</text>
  <text start="497.55" dur="5.94">vegetables if you look at fresh fruit</text>
  <text start="499.669" dur="7.331">that cost quite a bit if you look at</text>
  <text start="503.49" dur="6.57">other things like housing or education</text>
  <text start="507" dur="6.839">or health insurance people realize that</text>
  <text start="510.06" dur="7.919">those costs keep going up your</text>
  <text start="513.839" dur="6.031">electricity bill your cable bill that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="517.979" dur="5.041">because the dollar continually loses</text>
  <text start="519.87" dur="7.08">value they&amp;#39;re not noticing the tariffs</text>
  <text start="523.02" dur="7.11">and since their campaign failed they</text>
  <text start="526.95" dur="6.06">need to move on to the next propaganda</text>
  <text start="530.13" dur="3.57">hit job and that is where they are</text>
  <text start="533.01" dur="3.27">headed</text>
  <text start="533.7" dur="4.86">there they&amp;#39;re strategizing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="536.28" dur="4.2">trying to figure out a way to explain</text>
  <text start="538.56" dur="3.21">this economy now they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="540.48" dur="2.01">mention it and you could tell just by</text>
  <text start="541.77" dur="2.79">trying</text>
  <text start="542.49" dur="5.19">tweet from the beginning of the report</text>
  <text start="544.56" dur="6.87">that they there they&amp;#39;re gonna stay away</text>
  <text start="547.68" dur="6.779">from it completely and Trump the</text>
  <text start="551.43" dur="6.27">Patriots they&amp;#39;re right on track with the</text>
  <text start="554.459" dur="6.091">plan they have complete control of the</text>
  <text start="557.7" dur="6.15">entire economic system and now they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="560.55" dur="5.43">be moving forward to go after the</text>
  <text start="563.85" dur="4.71">central bank and they&amp;#39;re already setting</text>
  <text start="565.98" dur="2.97">up the central bank system to take the</text>

  <text start="568.95" dur="5.31">this is what Trump has been doing all</text>
