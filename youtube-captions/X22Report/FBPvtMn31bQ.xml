  <text start="254.78" dur="8.37">move the entire system from a central</text>
  <text start="258.289" dur="9.031">bank system to a people&amp;#39;s system that</text>
  <text start="263.15" dur="7.11">the people control so that people can</text>
  <text start="267.32" dur="5.87">enjoy the wealth now think about what is</text>
  <text start="270.26" dur="5.159">happening right now global debt is</text>
  <text start="273.19" dur="4.539">officially at a hundred and eighty four</text>
  <text start="275.419" dur="3.901">trillion which is around two hundred</text>
  <text start="277.729" dur="6.391">twenty five percent of global GDP this</text>
  <text start="279.32" dur="6.659">is about 86,000 for every person in the</text>
  <text start="284.12" dur="5.19">world which is two and a half times</text>
  <text start="285.979" dur="6.651">annual income now there are many people</text>
  <text start="289.31" dur="6.62">out there that are saying listen this</text>
  <text start="292.63" dur="4.96">global debt the official figures are</text>
  <text start="295.93" dur="6.46">understated by</text>
  <text start="297.59" dur="8.34">a factor of 2.5 so the debt is actually</text>
  <text start="302.39" dur="6.09">around 460 trillion which is five</text>
  <text start="305.93" dur="5.88">hundred and sixty percent of GDP which</text>
  <text start="308.48" dur="6.75">is two hundred and fifteen thousand per</text>
  <text start="311.81" dur="7.92">person this is how the central bank</text>
  <text start="315.23" dur="5.87">steals your wealth and this is what</text>
  <text start="319.73" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;ve been doing for a very long time</text>
  <text start="321.1" dur="7.35">these numbers are astronomical the</text>
  <text start="325.04" dur="6.21">weight of debt cannot be sustained</text>
  <text start="328.45" dur="3.25">essential bankers know this Trump knows</text>
  <text start="331.25" dur="3.66">this</text>
  <text start="331.7" dur="8.25">the Patriots know this they all know</text>
  <text start="334.91" dur="9.12">that this system will come down why do</text>
  <text start="339.95" dur="7.2">we have to worry about this because debt</text>
  <text start="344.03" dur="8.43">brought the world to its knees in 2008</text>
  <text start="347.15" dur="8.79">and in 2008 the central bank was allowed</text>
  <text start="352.46" dur="5.67">to do things that they were never</text>
  <text start="355.94" dur="5.99">allowed to do before actually it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="358.13" dur="8.73">even in their mandate but certain</text>
  <text start="361.93" dur="9.63">individuals voted and said yes were</text>
  <text start="366.86" dur="9.69">allowing you to do this create currency</text>
  <text start="371.56" dur="10.81">lower the rates control the economy make</text>
  <text start="376.55" dur="9.18">sure it doesn&amp;#39;t crash on our watch and</text>
  <text start="382.37" dur="6.03">when Trump came into office they started</text>
  <text start="385.73" dur="6.6">to raise rates they wanted it to crash</text>
  <text start="388.4" dur="11.21">on his watch this way they could blame</text>
  <text start="392.33" dur="11.4">him for the their failure their collapse</text>
  <text start="399.61" dur="5.41">Trump turned it all around Trump created</text>
  <text start="403.73" dur="3.33">this narrative and we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="405.02" dur="5.67">about this for quite a while he created</text>
  <text start="407.06" dur="7.53">a narrative where he used their system</text>
  <text start="410.69" dur="6.75">their economic system and he showed them</text>
  <text start="414.59" dur="5.67">listen I can do exactly what you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="417.44" dur="5.07">doing for years I can take all your</text>
  <text start="420.26" dur="5.52">statistical numbers and use it to my</text>
  <text start="422.51" dur="5.97">benefit I can use the magic wand to make</text>
  <text start="425.78" dur="5.669">the market go up I can do everything</text>
  <text start="428.48" dur="8.369">that you&amp;#39;ve been doing and I can change</text>
  <text start="431.449" dur="9.18">around and you can&amp;#39;t stop me and I Trump</text>
  <text start="436.849" dur="7.801">will control the economic narrative</text>
  <text start="440.629" dur="6.93">which means all eyes are now shifted</text>
  <text start="444.65" dur="5.489">away from me back on to the central bank</text>
  <text start="447.559" dur="5.16">because now I will be calling out the</text>
  <text start="450.139" dur="5.4">central bank every single day letting</text>
  <text start="452.719" dur="7.051">the people know that if anything goes</text>
  <text start="455.539" dur="7.05">wrong the central bank is to blame now</text>
  <text start="459.77" dur="4.91">the central bank knows this they know</text>
  <text start="462.589" dur="5.82">that there is no escape</text>
  <text start="464.68" dur="9.069">they know that if the system comes down</text>
  <text start="468.409" dur="8.401">right now they are to blame and this is</text>
  <text start="473.749" dur="5.73">why they&amp;#39;re following exactly what Trump</text>
  <text start="476.81" dur="6.75">and the Patriots want the reason why</text>
  <text start="479.479" dur="8.31">they need to lower rates is because the</text>
  <text start="483.56" dur="7.349">debt level is astronomical think about</text>
  <text start="487.789" dur="7.68">it for a second if the rates start</text>
  <text start="490.909" dur="6.75">moving up what happens well those people</text>
  <text start="495.469" dur="5.97">that are looking to buy a home to buy a</text>
  <text start="497.659" dur="7.171">car to go to college that comes to a</text>
  <text start="501.439" dur="4.29">complete stop they can&amp;#39;t do it they</text>
  <text start="504.83" dur="3.899">can&amp;#39;t afford it</text>
  <text start="505.729" dur="6.961">what happens to the debt levels of</text>
  <text start="508.729" dur="7.11">government well the amount that they</text>
  <text start="512.69" dur="7.889">have to repay goes way up not just for</text>
  <text start="515.839" dur="7.74">the United States but the world how will</text>
  <text start="520.579" dur="6.031">countries manage they won&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="523.579" dur="8.07">what happens to the system it comes</text>
  <text start="526.61" dur="9.589">crumbling down are we ready to have a</text>
  <text start="531.649" dur="8.75">collapse of the system not just yet</text>
  <text start="536.199" dur="7.361">Trump the Patriots they need more time</text>
  <text start="540.399" dur="5.351">they&amp;#39;ve been working as fast as they</text>
  <text start="543.56" dur="4.7">possibly can remember Trump came into</text>
  <text start="545.75" dur="6.019">office in 2016 he started working at</text>
  <text start="548.26" dur="8.559">2017 in 2017 he got elected in 2016</text>
  <text start="551.769" dur="10.361">they&amp;#39;ve had two years two and a half two</text>
  <text start="556.819" dur="7.081">and a half years to undo everything the</text>
  <text start="562.13" dur="6.81">globalists have done</text>
  <text start="563.9" dur="10.74">and try to create a new economy create</text>
  <text start="568.94" dur="7.17">new trade deals redo regulations so the</text>
  <text start="574.64" dur="3.57">people not just here in the United</text>

  <text start="584.9" dur="9.39">notice there is change new leaders are</text>
  <text start="589.69" dur="9.01">now being placed into position which</text>
  <text start="594.29" dur="11.04">means new trade deals will be made which</text>
  <text start="598.7" dur="9.96">means the system is being prepared to be</text>
  <text start="605.33" dur="8.69">moved from a central bank system into a</text>
  <text start="608.66" dur="8.82">people system we have no other choice</text>
  <text start="614.02" dur="5.26">Trump understands that we have no other</text>
  <text start="617.48" dur="4.5">choice now a lot of people say well</text>
  <text start="619.28" dur="5.22">before he was president he was saying</text>
  <text start="621.98" dur="6.45">that the stock market&amp;#39;s manipulated we</text>
  <text start="624.5" dur="7.56">have too much debt this is all true if</text>
  <text start="628.43" dur="6.36">he came in as president and told the</text>
  <text start="632.06" dur="5.67">American people the world that this</text>
  <text start="634.79" dur="7.17">system is going to crash what would</text>
  <text start="637.73" dur="10.05">happen it would be a disaster a better</text>

  <text start="647.78" dur="7.95">globalists have done create in parallel</text>
  <text start="651.17" dur="9.03">a new economic system one where we can</text>
  <text start="655.73" dur="10.11">shift from the central bank over to this</text>
  <text start="660.2" dur="7.86">new system and this system is going to</text>
  <text start="665.84" dur="5.67">come online just like it did back in the</text>
  <text start="668.06" dur="6.63">70s throughout the 60s they were</text>
  <text start="671.51" dur="6.99">preparing a petrodollar system in the</text>
  <text start="674.69" dur="8.61">seft 70s to make it go live they had a</text>
  <text start="678.5" dur="9.33">remove the entire economic system off of</text>
  <text start="683.3" dur="6.39">the gold standard and tell the people we</text>
  <text start="687.83" dur="3.51">will no longer use the gold standard</text>
  <text start="689.69" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;re going to use the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="691.34" dur="5.69">system which allows the central bank to</text>
  <text start="694.55" dur="5.92">create currency out of thin air with</text>
  <text start="697.03" dur="5.67">checks and balances that&amp;#39;s how we</text>
  <text start="700.47" dur="5.94">transitioned into a new system now</text>
  <text start="702.7" dur="6.09">remember it was very different back then</text>
  <text start="706.41" dur="6.82">because we&amp;#39;re coming from a sound money</text>
  <text start="708.79" dur="6.93">system moving into a fiat system and</text>
  <text start="713.23" dur="6.36">there were bumps along the way now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="715.72" dur="5.94">moving from this debt-ridden fianc</text>
  <text start="719.59" dur="4.62">system where the value of the dollar has</text>
  <text start="721.66" dur="5.43">decreased and we&amp;#39;re moving into a sound</text>
  <text start="724.21" dur="6.45">money system which is going to be in</text>
  <text start="727.09" dur="8.61">some ways backed by gold what does that</text>
  <text start="730.66" dur="9.93">mean it means since the dollar value has</text>
  <text start="735.7" dur="8.73">decreased gold well that is going to</text>
  <text start="740.59" dur="6.81">increase and it&amp;#39;s going to be a little</text>
  <text start="744.43" dur="6.6">tough for people because we&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="747.4" dur="8.55">from a crappy system into a sound money</text>

  <text start="755.95" dur="4.41">that are working together right now you</text>
  <text start="759.13" dur="3.24">just don&amp;#39;t see the other one just like</text>
  <text start="760.36" dur="3.99">throughout the 60s you didn&amp;#39;t see the</text>

  <text start="780.97" dur="3.87">wasn&amp;#39;t because the speculators it was</text>
  <text start="782.32" dur="6.09">because the central bank was already</text>
  <text start="784.84" dur="7.14">creating currency outside of the gold</text>
