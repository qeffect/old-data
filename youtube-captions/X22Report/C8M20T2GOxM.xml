  <text start="101.14" dur="5.43">corporate media the US government</text>
  <text start="103.24" dur="7.35">they&amp;#39;re continually trying to cover up</text>
  <text start="106.57" dur="6.899">what&amp;#39;s really happening here and what</text>
  <text start="110.59" dur="5.519">we&amp;#39;re seeing is consumer sentiment is</text>
  <text start="113.469" dur="6.36">completely decoupling from the</text>
  <text start="116.109" dur="6.781">illusionary propaganda that the US</text>

  <text start="128.89" dur="5.55">level is reaching near 2000 2015 lows</text>
  <text start="131.94" dur="6.55">but what&amp;#39;s even more interesting about</text>
  <text start="134.44" dur="6.57">this is that we talk about housing quite</text>
  <text start="138.49" dur="5">a bit and when I started mentioning that</text>
  <text start="141.01" dur="5.88">housing was starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="143.49" dur="5.62">housing prices were coming down they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="146.89" dur="6.75">hit the top it&amp;#39;s getting harder and</text>
  <text start="149.11" dur="6.33">harder to sell a home I started to see</text>
  <text start="153.64" dur="4.41">something very interesting something</text>
  <text start="155.44" dur="3.719">that we saw back in two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="158.05" dur="3.18">when everything was starting to fall</text>
  <text start="159.159" dur="3.871">apart remember when the Fed told us that</text>
  <text start="161.23" dur="2.97">everything was contained housing was</text>
  <text start="163.03" dur="4.86">fine</text>
  <text start="164.2" dur="5.61">Larry young from the association of</text>
  <text start="167.89" dur="4.95">realtors was out there saying that</text>
  <text start="169.81" dur="6.48">housing was going to rebound that this</text>
  <text start="172.84" dur="6.11">winter of 2008 was going to be much much</text>
  <text start="176.29" dur="5.279">better this was only a temporary setback</text>
  <text start="178.95" dur="6.069">well we&amp;#39;re starting to see the same</text>
  <text start="181.569" dur="8.071">exact thing occur right now and in the</text>
  <text start="185.019" dur="7.231">corporate media it said that you this is</text>
  <text start="189.64" dur="5.879">the headline US housing starts hit</text>
  <text start="192.25" dur="7.17">seven-month low setback seen as</text>
  <text start="195.519" dur="6.601">temporary now they&amp;#39;re already starting</text>
  <text start="199.42" dur="4.2">the propaganda because they realized</text>
  <text start="202.12" dur="3.03">that people are starting to wake up and</text>
  <text start="203.62" dur="3.839">they&amp;#39;re realizing that why isn&amp;#39;t my</text>
  <text start="205.15" dur="4.199">house selling I put it on the market</text>
  <text start="207.459" dur="6.151">it&amp;#39;s staying on the market longer longer</text>
  <text start="209.349" dur="5.881">and longer and something is going on</text>
  <text start="213.61" dur="3.42">here now of course the corporate media</text>
  <text start="215.23" dur="3.99">has to convince everyone that everything</text>
  <text start="217.03" dur="4.019">is fine so they&amp;#39;re putting it out that</text>
  <text start="219.22" dur="4.799">this is just temporary and we saw this</text>
  <text start="221.049" dur="5.94">back in 2008 with larry young when</text>
  <text start="224.019" dur="6.991">housing was completely imploding on</text>
  <text start="226.989" dur="6.481">itself in october of 2008 he was out</text>
  <text start="231.01" dur="3.68">there saying that the markets going to</text>
  <text start="233.47" dur="2.97">get better during the winter months</text>

  <text start="236.44" dur="4.32">turnaround we&amp;#39;re seeing the same thing</text>
  <text start="238.299" dur="5.16">happen right now and i look around today</text>
  <text start="240.76" dur="6.27">and housing is just getting worse and</text>
  <text start="243.459" dur="5.461">worse and it is spreading and this is</text>
  <text start="247.03" dur="3.66">why this propaganda is coming out right</text>
  <text start="248.92" dur="3.899">now because they&amp;#39;re trying to head it</text>
  <text start="250.69" dur="6.599">off and they&amp;#39;re trying to keep the</text>
  <text start="252.819" dur="8.04">illusion alive and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="257.289" dur="6">more and more economic indicators to let</text>
  <text start="260.859" dur="4.651">us know that whatever the government is</text>

  <text start="726.8" dur="5.1">are telling us it&amp;#39;s five percent and</text>
  <text start="729.1" dur="5.74">when we do the calculation it&amp;#39;s closer</text>
  <text start="731.9" dur="7.14">to thirty percent and we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="734.84" dur="7.37">same thing with gallop so who are all</text>
  <text start="739.04" dur="7.17">these people that don&amp;#39;t have work well</text>
  <text start="742.21" dur="11.17">gallop put this together and there are</text>
  <text start="746.21" dur="9.9">about 3.7 billion people basically not</text>
  <text start="753.38" dur="4.68">working and gallop explains what they</text>
  <text start="756.11" dur="5.64">mean by not working about 1 billion</text>
  <text start="758.06" dur="6.39">people are self-employed about 400</text>
  <text start="761.75" dur="6.33">million work part time and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="764.45" dur="6.21">want to work full time 300 million work</text>
  <text start="768.08" dur="4.68">part time and they would love to work</text>
  <text start="770.66" dur="6.27">and get that full time job they just</text>
  <text start="772.76" dur="7.8">can&amp;#39;t find it 250 million are unemployed</text>
  <text start="776.93" dur="7.23">and they would like to work and the rest</text>
  <text start="780.56" dur="7.11">are out of the workforce this is how</text>
  <text start="784.16" dur="7.97">this breaks down and what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="787.67" dur="6.57">here is out of the self-employed people</text>
  <text start="792.13" dur="4.48">they&amp;#39;re saying half of these</text>
  <text start="794.24" dur="5.1">self-employed people aren&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="796.61" dur="4.65">working right now so they cut that</text>
  <text start="799.34" dur="4.02">number in half and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="801.26" dur="5.28">there&amp;#39;s only 200 million that are</text>
  <text start="803.36" dur="8.36">actually working as a self-employed</text>
  <text start="806.54" dur="10.44">person so the global unemployment is a</text>
  <text start="811.72" dur="11.26">complete and utter disaster this economy</text>
  <text start="816.98" dur="8.85">is completely imploding on itself and we</text>
  <text start="822.98" dur="5.67">know there&amp;#39;s a huge amount of debt out</text>
  <text start="825.83" dur="6.33">there the central banks are continually</text>
  <text start="828.65" dur="4.809">creating more and more money which is</text>
  <text start="832.16" dur="6">adding to the debt low</text>
  <text start="833.459" dur="8.49">good and there is no way out of this</text>
  <text start="838.16" dur="5.799">peter schiff is saying that china is</text>
  <text start="841.949" dur="4.591">preparing for something big right now</text>
  <text start="843.959" dur="6.331">he&amp;#39;s saying it could be a goal back you</text>
  <text start="846.54" dur="5.849">one I I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised because</text>
  <text start="850.29" dur="5.399">that&amp;#39;s what China&amp;#39;s been doing it&amp;#39;s been</text>

  <text start="868.35" dur="7.799">hubs and Russia and uh and Germany just</text>
  <text start="873.209" dur="7.831">basically set up their you one trading</text>
  <text start="876.149" dur="7.44">centers and Russia right now is taking</text>
  <text start="881.04" dur="5.19">all of this to the next level because</text>
  <text start="883.589" dur="7.23">they&amp;#39;re looking at Iran and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="886.23" dur="6.659">going to set up an open joint bank Turan</text>

  <text start="895.589" dur="4.521">projects this could happen soon it</text>
  <text start="898.139" dur="6.29">depends on the technical details and</text>
  <text start="900.11" dur="8.349">basically Russia is going to flip the</text>
  <text start="904.429" dur="9.34">flip that provide the initial capital</text>
  <text start="908.459" dur="7.74">for the banks and basically they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="913.769" dur="6.391">going to bypass the dollar completely</text>
  <text start="916.199" dur="6.3">and remember what I said about a ram we</text>
  <text start="920.16" dur="5.88">understand there&amp;#39;s a p5 plus one deal</text>
  <text start="922.499" dur="4.95">going on right now this nuclear deal and</text>
  <text start="926.04" dur="6.389">this is the cover story that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="927.449" dur="6.151">using what&amp;#39;s really going on is the part</text>
  <text start="932.429" dur="6.361">they don&amp;#39;t want to tell you about and</text>
  <text start="933.6" dur="8.31">that is the US government the central</text>
  <text start="938.79" dur="5.13">bankers working with Iran to make sure</text>
  <text start="941.91" dur="4.729">they&amp;#39;re going to set up a central bank</text>

  <text start="946.639" dur="5.44">the market using the dollar and we see</text>
  <text start="950.369" dur="6.44">Russia stepping in setting up a joint</text>
  <text start="952.079" dur="7.47">bank but Ren and we know as time goes on</text>
  <text start="956.809" dur="4.9">Iran is going to say why are we using</text>
  <text start="959.549" dur="4.26">the dollar it makes no sense and</text>
  <text start="961.709" dur="5.401">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen they</text>
  <text start="963.809" dur="4.65">will not use it and this is when</text>
  <text start="967.11" dur="4.59">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="968.459" dur="9.481">bankers will go into a ram if we get</text>
  <text start="971.7" dur="8.16">that far now we understand the Federal</text>
  <text start="977.94" dur="4.23">Reserve is not part of the government</text>
  <text start="979.86" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s a private corporation they push a</text>
  <text start="982.17" dur="5.69">button they create money out of thin air</text>
  <text start="983.88" dur="6.389">or I should say currency and this really</text>
  <text start="987.86" dur="3.789">is something that the United States</text>
  <text start="990.269" dur="3.151">government doesn&amp;#39;t even need the people</text>
  <text start="991.649" dur="4.471">don&amp;#39;t need the central bank to do that</text>
  <text start="993.42" dur="3.72">the government can do this and guess</text>
  <text start="996.12" dur="6.469">what they don&amp;#39;t have to loan it to</text>
  <text start="997.14" dur="9.9">themselves with interest so moments ago</text>
  <text start="1002.589" dur="9.25">with a vote of 241 to 185 the House</text>
  <text start="1007.04" dur="7.16">passed HR 3189 also known as the federal</text>
  <text start="1011.839" dur="4.68">oversight reform and modernization act</text>
  <text start="1014.2" dur="4.569">the bill would make changes to how the</text>
  <text start="1016.519" dur="4.471">Fed conducts monetary policy and</text>
  <text start="1018.769" dur="4.951">regulatory activities and would direct</text>
  <text start="1020.99" dur="6.449">the Fed to take a rules-based approach</text>
  <text start="1023.72" dur="6.959">to interest rate decisions if we require</text>
  <text start="1027.439" dur="5.671">audits have more fed functions such as</text>
  <text start="1030.679" dur="5.16">monetary policy and place restrictions</text>
  <text start="1033.11" dur="4.16">on its emergency lending powers in other</text>
  <text start="1035.839" dur="3.811">words everything the banks that are</text>
  <text start="1037.27" dur="5.049">direct and indirect stakeholders in the</text>
  <text start="1039.65" dur="9.5">Fed would fight to the death to prevent</text>
  <text start="1042.319" dur="10.321">and guess what Obama is going to veto it</text>
  <text start="1049.15" dur="8.05">now you know who has control of the</text>
  <text start="1052.64" dur="9.12">country now you know who obama answers</text>
  <text start="1057.2" dur="6.39">to the central banking system and this</text>
  <text start="1061.76" dur="5.58">flows all the way up to the Roth trials</text>
  <text start="1063.59" dur="4.829">and what and what&amp;#39;s very interesting and</text>
  <text start="1067.34" dur="7.23">something when you all need to think</text>
  <text start="1068.419" dur="10.461">about a private bank cartel created by</text>
  <text start="1074.57" dur="10.67">Congress doesn&amp;#39;t want Congress to</text>
  <text start="1078.88" dur="6.36">authorize this new bill to audit them</text>
  <text start="1085.57" dur="5.2">what we need to do is we need to get rid</text>
  <text start="1088.309" dur="4.981">of the central bank that&amp;#39;s what we need</text>
  <text start="1090.77" dur="5.039">to do at this point there is no reason</text>
  <text start="1093.29" dur="6.53">for it whatsoever it does not add a</text>
  <text start="1095.809" dur="4.011">benefit to this country</text>
  <text start="1100.49" dur="6.09">if someone can come up with a benefit</text>
  <text start="1102.38" dur="7.11">let me know because so far there is</text>
  <text start="1106.58" dur="5.93">absolutely nothing that they give that</text>
  <text start="1109.49" dur="5.49">the government can&amp;#39;t do without them and</text>
  <text start="1112.51" dur="5.98">everyone says well they create the money</text>
  <text start="1114.98" dur="4.62">they manage the affairs of the United</text>
  <text start="1118.49" dur="3.45">Sates no it&amp;#39;s a private corporation</text>
  <text start="1119.6" dur="5.84">their mandate is completely different</text>
  <text start="1121.94" dur="5.64">than what the government&amp;#39;s mandate is</text>
  <text start="1125.44" dur="4.63">their government mandates supposed to be</text>
  <text start="1127.58" dur="6.3">to the people a private corporation is</text>
  <text start="1130.07" dur="6.96">to themselves it&amp;#39;s to profit why in the</text>
  <text start="1133.88" dur="6.45">world if the government can create their</text>
  <text start="1137.03" dur="8">own currency and use it without interest</text>
  <text start="1140.33" dur="8.82">why would they go to a central bank take</text>
  <text start="1145.03" dur="6.97">this made-up currency and allow this</text>
  <text start="1149.15" dur="5.97">bank to loan it to them with interest</text>
  <text start="1152" dur="6.87">attached to it and then the government</text>
  <text start="1155.12" dur="8.34">go ahead and print up a bond to give it</text>
  <text start="1158.87" dur="7.23">to them it makes no sense because if</text>
  <text start="1163.46" dur="4.26">they can print the bond guess what they</text>
  <text start="1166.1" dur="4.94">can print currency or they can hit a</text>
  <text start="1167.72" dur="6.54">keystroke and create a digital currency</text>
  <text start="1171.04" dur="6.1">with no problem and the Constitution</text>
  <text start="1174.26" dur="6.15">allows the government to do this because</text>
  <text start="1177.14" dur="7.02">our founding fathers knew this is a</text>
  <text start="1180.41" dur="8.46">problem the central bank is the main</text>
  <text start="1184.16" dur="7.71">problem now we understand the US</text>
  <text start="1188.87" dur="6.21">government is continually trying to</text>
  <text start="1191.87" dur="5.61">bring in revenue because as this system</text>
  <text start="1195.08" dur="4.92">collapses they need more and more</text>
  <text start="1197.48" dur="4.23">revenue because of the debt problem and</text>
  <text start="1200" dur="3.15">of course they tried all different</text>
  <text start="1201.71" dur="3.63">things which we discussed many many</text>
  <text start="1203.15" dur="5.73">times before but let me just go off on</text>
  <text start="1205.34" dur="5.46">Obamacare for a second because we see</text>
  <text start="1208.88" dur="3.9">something very interesting we know the</text>
  <text start="1210.8" dur="3.42">health insurance companies created this</text>
  <text start="1212.78" dur="4.41">bill now they thought they were going to</text>
  <text start="1214.22" dur="4.26">profit tremendously from this they were</text>
  <text start="1217.19" dur="4.41">going to get all the American people</text>
  <text start="1218.48" dur="4.47">aunt on board with this they were going</text>
  <text start="1221.6" dur="5.18">to be able to raise the premiums like</text>
  <text start="1222.95" dur="5.79">they have and by using these penalties</text>
  <text start="1226.78" dur="4.029">everyone would have to get health</text>
  <text start="1228.74" dur="3.75">insurance well it&amp;#39;s not working out that</text>
  <text start="1230.809" dur="2.821">way we&amp;#39;re seeing about almost fifty</text>
  <text start="1232.49" dur="1.83">percent of the co-op&amp;#39;s going out of</text>
  <text start="1233.63" dur="7.019">business</text>
  <text start="1234.32" dur="9.959">and now the largest health insurer guess</text>
  <text start="1240.649" dur="6.481">what US health insurer wants to pull out</text>
  <text start="1244.279" dur="5.701">and that&amp;#39;s kind of strange they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="1247.13" dur="6.919">ones who wrote the bill now why would</text>
  <text start="1249.98" dur="7.14">they want to pull out well basically</text>
  <text start="1254.049" dur="7.691">they&amp;#39;re saying that the 2015 earning</text>
  <text start="1257.12" dur="8.37">forecast is absolutely awful and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1261.74" dur="7.919">not worth being included with Obamacare</text>
  <text start="1265.49" dur="7.47">right now and they&amp;#39;re going to scale</text>
  <text start="1269.659" dur="7.321">back marketing efforts for plans for its</text>
  <text start="1272.96" dur="9.15">plans selling this year and quit the</text>
  <text start="1276.98" dur="9">business entirely in 2016 2017 because</text>
  <text start="1282.11" dur="7.62">it&amp;#39;s not worth their while this</text>
  <text start="1285.98" dur="6.419">Obamacare was never ever a benefit to</text>
  <text start="1289.73" dur="4.5">the people how could it be think about</text>
  <text start="1292.399" dur="6.691">it when Obama told us about the</text>
  <text start="1294.23" dur="6.87">Affordable Care Act aka Obamacare he</text>
  <text start="1299.09" dur="4.53">told us that oh the premiums are going</text>
  <text start="1301.1" dur="6.059">to be twenty five hundred dollars per</text>
  <text start="1303.62" dur="7.439">family very inexpensive well they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1307.159" dur="6.451">doubled their 4865 dollars per family</text>
  <text start="1311.059" dur="5.1">and the deductibles are very high these</text>
  <text start="1313.61" dur="5.87">health insurance policies are worthless</text>
  <text start="1316.159" dur="6">you could have gotten this before</text>
  <text start="1319.48" dur="3.52">actually the premiums probably would</text>
  <text start="1322.159" dur="4.26">have been lower because it was</text>
  <text start="1323" dur="4.769">competition but this is not a benefit to</text>
  <text start="1326.419" dur="5.37">the people you could have gotten this</text>
  <text start="1327.769" dur="6.091">before this is not helping anybody and</text>
  <text start="1331.789" dur="6.24">everything the government has tried up</text>
  <text start="1333.86" dur="7.799">to this point has not worked we are</text>
  <text start="1338.029" dur="7.051">heading into a death spiral and the</text>
