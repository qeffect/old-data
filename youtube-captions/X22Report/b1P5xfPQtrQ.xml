  <text start="72.58" dur="6.99">understand that this is all done on</text>
  <text start="74.979" dur="7.95">purpose because they&amp;#39;re trying to keep</text>
  <text start="79.57" dur="5.04">the bank safe from bank runs and we</text>
  <text start="82.929" dur="4.351">could see right now from Armstrong</text>

  <text start="98.56" dur="6.179">advocate the elimination of all cash and</text>
  <text start="102.539" dur="4.301">we can see that they&amp;#39;re moving this</text>
  <text start="104.739" dur="4.44">forward and they&amp;#39;re going to do their</text>
  <text start="106.84" dur="4.74">best the best they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="109.179" dur="6.841">remove all cash and this will definitely</text>
  <text start="111.58" dur="6.989">stop the run on banks it will also allow</text>
  <text start="116.02" dur="7.109">governments to track every single</text>
  <text start="118.569" dur="10.11">purchase we understand that the dollar</text>
  <text start="123.129" dur="9.121">is collapsing Saudi Arabia kind of</text>
  <text start="128.679" dur="7.111">acknowledges that yes the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="132.25" dur="7.92">is ending they&amp;#39;re saying that the petro</text>
  <text start="135.79" dur="6.93">dollar is going to end by 2032 they have</text>
  <text start="140.17" dur="5.52">announced plans to invest by 2032 a</text>
  <text start="142.72" dur="4.95">total of 109 billion in the solar</text>
  <text start="145.69" dur="4.769">industry and become an exporter of</text>
  <text start="147.67" dur="5.55">electricity and of course they&amp;#39;re giving</text>
  <text start="150.459" dur="4.56">us the date of 2032 and we know that</text>
  <text start="153.22" dur="3.239">this is going to happen much sooner</text>
  <text start="155.019" dur="3.991">because every time they tell us</text>
  <text start="156.459" dur="4.081">something it&amp;#39;s normally the opposite</text>
  <text start="159.01" dur="3.6">when they bring it out for a very long</text>
  <text start="160.54" dur="4.01">period of time something is going to</text>
  <text start="162.61" dur="4.13">happen much much sooner and we</text>
  <text start="164.55" dur="4.26">see all the signs that are pointing</text>
  <text start="166.74" dur="3.87">towards the end of the dollar we can see</text>
  <text start="168.81" dur="3.75">these central bankers making</text>
  <text start="170.61" dur="3.81">preparations we see the US government</text>
  <text start="172.56" dur="4.02">making preparations we see the Canadian</text>
  <text start="174.42" dur="4.35">government the European governments the</text>
  <text start="176.58" dur="5.54">Australian Government all making</text>
  <text start="178.77" dur="6.36">preparations for this collapse scenario</text>
  <text start="182.12" dur="7.44">this is why we see these false flag</text>
  <text start="185.13" dur="7.05">events this is why we see everyone um</text>
  <text start="189.56" dur="4.21">giving up their rights because the</text>
  <text start="192.18" dur="3.87">government is telling them we need to</text>
  <text start="193.77" dur="6.24">keep you safe we need more troops on the</text>
  <text start="196.05" dur="6.78">ground we need to spy on you we need to</text>
  <text start="200.01" dur="4.59">make sure that you are safe this is the</text>
  <text start="202.83" dur="3.51">reasons we need to do this they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="204.6" dur="4.68">this on purpose because they need to</text>
  <text start="206.34" dur="8.37">understand who is a threat to their</text>
  <text start="209.28" dur="10.08">authority we see the US Senate has</text>
  <text start="214.71" dur="6.33">passed the fast track for the TPP the</text>
  <text start="219.36" dur="3.48">bill will now head to the house of</text>
  <text start="221.04" dur="4.65">representatives for a vote early next</text>
  <text start="222.84" dur="6.119">month if this is passed it will give the</text>
  <text start="225.69" dur="5.97">power to Obama to negotiate trade pacts</text>
  <text start="228.959" dur="4.921">with other countries and he really</text>
  <text start="231.66" dur="7.62">doesn&amp;#39;t have to inform Congress and get</text>
  <text start="233.88" dur="7.92">their approval this is all being done to</text>
  <text start="239.28" dur="5.52">help the central bank the corporate</text>
  <text start="241.8" dur="4.56">powers and it is not being done to help</text>
  <text start="244.8" dur="5.01">the people this is why it was kept a</text>
  <text start="246.36" dur="6.81">secret from the people this is why they</text>
  <text start="249.81" dur="5.94">say listen no cameras no notes you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="253.17" dur="5.73">discuss it and if you do and you lick it</text>
  <text start="255.75" dur="6.39">you can go to jail anything that is a</text>
  <text start="258.9" dur="5.28">secret like this means that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="262.14" dur="3.69">hiding something even though they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="264.18" dur="3">trying to convince us that no no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="265.83" dur="4.68">really for the people if it&amp;#39;s truly for</text>
  <text start="267.18" dur="4.65">the people and this is democracy then</text>
  <text start="270.51" dur="3.23">the people should be able to read it</text>
  <text start="271.83" dur="6.66">understand it and know what&amp;#39;s in it</text>
  <text start="273.74" dur="9.88">period that&amp;#39;s it because again we the</text>
  <text start="278.49" dur="9.36">people it&amp;#39;s not we the government we see</text>
  <text start="283.62" dur="6">for the second time US senators rejected</text>
  <text start="287.85" dur="4.23">a bill to abolish the National Security</text>
  <text start="289.62" dur="5.91">Agency&amp;#39;s bulk collection of American</text>
  <text start="292.08" dur="6.4">phone records the vote came in at 57 242</text>
  <text start="295.53" dur="5.68">and the US Freedom Act failed on Friday</text>
  <text start="298.48" dur="6.36">well the US Freedom Act or the USA</text>
  <text start="301.21" dur="5.22">Freedom Act doesn&amp;#39;t really stop the bulk</text>
  <text start="304.84" dur="5.07">collection really all it does is it</text>
  <text start="306.43" dur="6.18">transfers it to corporations and they</text>
  <text start="309.91" dur="4.32">will be collecting all this data and</text>
  <text start="312.61" dur="3.66">handing it over to the government and</text>
  <text start="314.23" dur="4.56">this doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the government is</text>
  <text start="316.27" dur="4.29">going to stop spying whatsoever and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="318.79" dur="3.77">a good thing that USA Freedom Act was</text>
  <text start="320.56" dur="7.08">turned down because the Patriot Act</text>
  <text start="322.56" dur="7.57">expires June first and it would be a</text>
  <text start="327.64" dur="6.45">fantastic thing if it does expire</text>
  <text start="330.13" dur="7.53">because it is in complete violation with</text>
  <text start="334.09" dur="8.28">the Fourth Amendment and we could see</text>
  <text start="337.66" dur="7.5">that the US government officials if you</text>
  <text start="342.37" dur="5.49">like to call that they really don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="345.16" dur="7.26">that they&amp;#39;re violating the rights of the</text>
  <text start="347.86" dur="7.47">people they need to let this go and</text>
  <text start="352.42" dur="6.24">expire but they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="355.33" dur="6">possibly can by pushing the USA Freedom</text>
  <text start="358.66" dur="5.4">Act and again any bill that says Freedom</text>
  <text start="361.33" dur="5.31">Act Affordable Care Act Patriot Act it</text>
  <text start="364.06" dur="6.09">is always the opposite and all they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="366.64" dur="6.21">doing is switching everything to the</text>
  <text start="370.15" dur="6.17">corporation&amp;#39;s well it seems like a</text>
  <text start="372.85" dur="6.69">fascistic society to me US government</text>
  <text start="376.32" dur="4.63">corporations melding into one the</text>
  <text start="379.54" dur="4.65">government can say we&amp;#39;re not spying on</text>
  <text start="380.95" dur="4.68">the people because the corporations are</text>
  <text start="384.19" dur="5.91">keeping all the data and just handing it</text>
  <text start="385.63" dur="7.83">over to us very convenient we see the</text>
  <text start="390.1" dur="5.81">Pentagon is getting prepared for a</text>
  <text start="393.46" dur="4.47">missile attack from North Korea and Iran</text>
  <text start="395.91" dur="6.1">which actually what they&amp;#39;re really doing</text>
  <text start="397.93" dur="8.04">is they&amp;#39;re setting up and preparing for</text>
  <text start="402.01" dur="6.06">what is going to happen coming very soon</text>
  <text start="405.97" dur="4.92">which is war and they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="408.07" dur="5.67">preparing for Russia China the more</text>

  <text start="423.34" dur="5.58">enemy threats such as Iran and North</text>
  <text start="426.22" dur="5.21">Korea well the missile shield in Eastern</text>
  <text start="428.92" dur="4.85">Europe is really for Russia</text>
  <text start="431.43" dur="6.09">early detection radar system is really</text>
  <text start="433.77" dur="6.09">for China and Russia they&amp;#39;re saying the</text>
  <text start="437.52" dur="4.35">new lr dr will serve as a mid-course</text>
  <text start="439.86" dur="4.41">sensor to improve target discrimination</text>
  <text start="441.87" dur="4.26">capability for our ballistic missile</text>

  <text start="447.93" dur="7.56">the capacity of ground-based midcourse</text>
  <text start="450.18" dur="8.4">defense what&amp;#39;s happening here is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="455.49" dur="5.91">putting everything into place to prepare</text>
  <text start="458.58" dur="4.74">for this upcoming war they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="461.4" dur="5.07">maneuvering military assets into the</text>

  <text start="478.11" dur="5.55">toward the Pacific they want to bring</text>
  <text start="480.66" dur="7.23">more advanced weapons into Japan we see</text>
  <text start="483.66" dur="7.23">the Middle East is basically now under</text>
  <text start="487.89" dur="4.41">full-blown war in Yemen it&amp;#39;s spreading</text>
  <text start="490.89" dur="3.9">to Libya because the people are taking</text>
  <text start="492.3" dur="4.14">back their countries because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="494.79" dur="5.25">want the puppet governments in their</text>
  <text start="496.44" dur="6.96">countries and we can see that the people</text>
  <text start="500.04" dur="6.81">are making gains in this area even in</text>
  <text start="503.4" dur="6.9">Ukraine they&amp;#39;re having problems there</text>
  <text start="506.85" dur="5.55">this is why they had to bring in u.s.</text>
  <text start="510.3" dur="5.13">trainers to train the military in</text>
  <text start="512.4" dur="5.07">Ukraine because Ukrainian people are</text>
  <text start="515.43" dur="4.65">their hearts are not into this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="517.47" dur="4.77">fighting their own people and we can see</text>
  <text start="520.08" dur="3.87">the poroshenko is not following along</text>
  <text start="522.24" dur="5.12">he&amp;#39;s not sticking to the Minsk to</text>
  <text start="523.95" dur="8.34">agreement even the OSCE is out there</text>
  <text start="527.36" dur="7.75">saying that they have spotted five main</text>
  <text start="532.29" dur="4.53">battle tanks 260 fours in the</text>
  <text start="535.11" dur="3.93">government-controlled areas of eastern</text>
  <text start="536.82" dur="6.96">Ukraine and they&amp;#39;re saying this</text>
  <text start="539.04" dur="6.66">completely violates the Minsk Accord we</text>
  <text start="543.78" dur="5.7">see they&amp;#39;re continually firing on the</text>
  <text start="545.7" dur="5.58">airport in Donetsk and every time they</text>
  <text start="549.48" dur="2.82">fire the people in the southeastern</text>
  <text start="551.28" dur="4.08">region they&amp;#39;re recording it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="552.3" dur="7.56">saying 27 times it was violated but</text>
  <text start="555.36" dur="6.09">there is no penalty for Kiev there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="559.86" dur="5.13">only a penalty for the southeastern</text>
  <text start="561.45" dur="7.98">people or Russia so how is this fair</text>
  <text start="564.99" dur="7.77">it isn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s one-sided and we could see</text>
  <text start="569.43" dur="7.04">right now that the US and other nations</text>
  <text start="572.76" dur="6.93">are in Ukraine training preparing</text>
  <text start="576.47" dur="5.86">getting ready for a major offensive in</text>
  <text start="579.69" dur="7.23">the southeastern area we see out in</text>
  <text start="582.33" dur="6.54">Yemen Iran tried to bring in their Red</text>
  <text start="586.92" dur="5.66">Crescent plane carrying about 20 tons of</text>
  <text start="588.87" dur="5.64">food to Yemen and they were denied in</text>
  <text start="592.58" dur="4.629">Djibouti they would not let them land</text>
  <text start="594.51" dur="5.67">and they&amp;#39;re saying that this is where</text>
  <text start="597.209" dur="6.031">the UN relief hub is we have permission</text>
  <text start="600.18" dur="4.95">from the UN and they will not let the</text>
  <text start="603.24" dur="3.39">plane land so a turn around and went</text>
  <text start="605.13" dur="3.17">back to around the ship they were</text>
  <text start="606.63" dur="6.87">bringing in that they wanted a dock in</text>
  <text start="608.3" dur="7.72">Yemen was diverted to Djibouti it seems</text>
  <text start="613.5" dur="4.47">that the ship is there now un is</text>
  <text start="616.02" dur="3.35">inspecting it Red Cross is inspecting it</text>
  <text start="617.97" dur="4.77">and then they will go ahead and</text>
  <text start="619.37" dur="5.95">hopefully give the humanitarian aid to</text>
  <text start="622.74" dur="6.14">the people of Yemen we see that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="625.32" dur="6.72">going to be talks a un-backed talks with</text>
  <text start="628.88" dur="5.98">the Yemeni people and the president but</text>

  <text start="634.86" dur="4.289">talks on Yemen very interesting you have</text>

  <text start="642.75" dur="6.39">here we want our country back and of</text>
  <text start="645.66" dur="5.97">course now since he was a puppet ruler</text>
  <text start="649.14" dur="5.13">of the United States the United States</text>
  <text start="651.63" dur="6.72">is using Saudi Arabia as a proxy army to</text>
  <text start="654.27" dur="7.47">put him back in power in Ukraine they</text>
  <text start="658.35" dur="6.57">were behind the people to remove the</text>
  <text start="661.74" dur="6.409">elected president in a Kovich and put in</text>
  <text start="664.92" dur="5.76">a puppet government so we could see if</text>
  <text start="668.149" dur="3.94">the US doesn&amp;#39;t have control of the</text>
  <text start="670.68" dur="3.899">country they want a puppet government</text>
  <text start="672.089" dur="4.681">there behind the people if they already</text>
  <text start="674.579" dur="3.601">have a puppet government in there and</text>
  <text start="676.77" dur="3.09">the people decide to kick them out</text>
  <text start="678.18" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re no longer behind the people</text>
  <text start="679.86" dur="4.919">there behind the puppet government and</text>
  <text start="682.29" dur="7.47">the people now are terrorists this is</text>
  <text start="684.779" dur="8.461">how it works we see the UN is saying the</text>
  <text start="689.76" dur="6">situation in Libya is getting worse it</text>
  <text start="693.24" dur="4.58">is a serious threat and the Islamic</text>
  <text start="695.76" dur="6.08">state is making</text>
  <text start="697.82" dur="6">incredible moves in Libya and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="701.84" dur="4.5">going to have to react very quickly to</text>
  <text start="703.82" dur="5.22">the situation or the whole country will</text>
  <text start="706.34" dur="4.32">just deteriorate and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="709.04" dur="5.52">getting prepared to go into Libya very</text>
  <text start="710.66" dur="6.75">very soon we see the u.s. may be sending</text>
  <text start="714.56" dur="5.01">target spotters into Iraq now I know</text>
  <text start="717.41" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re saying Iraq but guess what they</text>
  <text start="719.57" dur="5.31">will be setting targets potters into</text>
  <text start="721.67" dur="6.36">Iraq and Syria but you know what they&amp;#39;re</text>
