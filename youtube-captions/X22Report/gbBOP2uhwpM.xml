  <text start="31.84" dur="4.5">today&amp;#39;s date is March 31st 2014 and the</text>
  <text start="34.809" dur="2.941">title of this episode is Russia and</text>
  <text start="36.34" dur="3.989">trying to make another move that</text>
  <text start="37.75" dur="4.38">threatens the dollar and on Saturday I</text>
  <text start="40.329" dur="3.931">reported what China was doing and making</text>
  <text start="42.13" dur="3.63">all these deals one of their latest one</text>
  <text start="44.26" dur="3.75">was with New Zealand they&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="45.76" dur="5.52">bilateral trade with the yuyuan it will</text>
  <text start="48.01" dur="5.31">completely bypass the dollar Russia now</text>
  <text start="51.28" dur="4.89">is setting up their economy to</text>
  <text start="53.32" dur="4.59">completely bypass the dollar and of</text>
  <text start="56.17" dur="4.02">course the US government the central</text>
  <text start="57.91" dur="4.469">bankers are sitting there saying we need</text>
  <text start="60.19" dur="4.859">to invade more countries to prop up this</text>
  <text start="62.379" dur="5.401">dollar long enough for us to get some</text>
  <text start="65.049" dur="5.67">type of war started so we can cover up</text>
  <text start="67.78" dur="5.339">this entire collapse because this</text>
  <text start="70.719" dur="4.321">collapse has to do with all the private</text>
  <text start="73.119" dur="4.891">western central bank countries I mean</text>
  <text start="75.04" dur="4.59">the Europe is in horrible shape United</text>
  <text start="78.01" dur="3.42">States is in horrible shape of course we</text>
  <text start="79.63" dur="3.57">have an illusion here they&amp;#39;ve changed</text>
  <text start="81.43" dur="3.57">all the calculations and it make</text>
  <text start="83.2" dur="3.209">everyone is believing that we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="85" dur="3.51">recovery when we&amp;#39;re really not</text>
  <text start="86.409" dur="4.231">and now the Census Bureau is getting in</text>
  <text start="88.51" dur="4.26">trouble for fabricating data and</text>
  <text start="90.64" dur="4.95">information and all of it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="92.77" dur="4.47">really come out but if we look at Spain</text>
  <text start="95.59" dur="4.44">right now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is they</text>
  <text start="97.24" dur="5.37">increase their taxes massively because</text>
  <text start="100.03" dur="4.74">they needed more revenue coming in and</text>
  <text start="102.61" dur="4.97">as I said in the past all these</text>
  <text start="104.77" dur="6.389">countries who have a huge amount of debt</text>
  <text start="107.58" dur="5.74">austerity high unemployment they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="111.159" dur="5.521">have a printing press so they need to</text>
  <text start="113.32" dur="5.85">raise taxes raise taxes just to make</text>
  <text start="116.68" dur="5.1">ends meet and right now well Spain</text>
  <text start="119.17" dur="5.58">missed its budget deficit even though</text>
  <text start="121.78" dur="5.22">they raised taxes massively they just</text>
  <text start="124.75" dur="4.2">couldn&amp;#39;t get there and again we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="127" dur="4.379">seeing this in all the countries because</text>
  <text start="128.95" dur="5.61">what we know is the European nations are</text>
  <text start="131.379" dur="6.12">in a recession slash depression in the</text>
  <text start="134.56" dur="5.189">UK we understand that housing is pretty</text>
  <text start="137.499" dur="3.031">much in a bubble and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="139.749" dur="2.611">see a</text>
  <text start="140.53" dur="5.31">slowed-down just like we saw here in the</text>
  <text start="142.36" dur="6.59">United States mortgage approvals have</text>
  <text start="145.84" dur="6.09">slowed in February by more than expected</text>
  <text start="148.95" dur="5.619">possibly reflecting of course bad</text>
  <text start="151.93" dur="5.01">weather during that month and this is</text>
  <text start="154.569" dur="4.5">what they always use they always use the</text>
  <text start="156.94" dur="3.87">bad weather and again it couldn&amp;#39;t be the</text>
  <text start="159.069" dur="2.611">economy it couldn&amp;#39;t be that people just</text>
  <text start="160.81" dur="2.67">can&amp;#39;t afford it</text>
  <text start="161.68" dur="3.33">it just it couldn&amp;#39;t be anything else</text>
  <text start="163.48" dur="2.4">except for the weather but we know</text>
  <text start="165.01" dur="3.12">better than this</text>
  <text start="165.88" dur="5.55">we know the economies around the world</text>
  <text start="168.13" dur="5.03">are starting to fail now here in the</text>
  <text start="171.43" dur="3.9">United States what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="173.16" dur="5.52">pretty much the same thing but what</text>
  <text start="175.33" dur="6.36">they&amp;#39;ve done was they&amp;#39;ve completely</text>
  <text start="178.68" dur="5.65">manipulated the calculation they changed</text>
  <text start="181.69" dur="4.079">the calculations they give us fake data</text>
  <text start="184.33" dur="3.18">and false information which really</text>
  <text start="185.769" dur="3.901">doesn&amp;#39;t fit in to what&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="187.51" dur="4.38">happening in the economy and especially</text>
  <text start="189.67" dur="5.37">all of you and I know myself you can</text>
  <text start="191.89" dur="5.64">actually feel that this economy does not</text>
  <text start="195.04" dur="4.25">make sense you know people who are out</text>
  <text start="197.53" dur="4.08">of work who are trying to get jobs</text>
  <text start="199.29" dur="4.479">students are coming out of college they</text>
  <text start="201.61" dur="3.75">can&amp;#39;t find work the government saying oh</text>
  <text start="203.769" dur="2.401">I understand you can&amp;#39;t find work so what</text>
  <text start="205.36" dur="2.81">we&amp;#39;re going to do is we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="206.17" dur="4.86">modify your student loans help you uh</text>
  <text start="208.17" dur="4.72">pay for these and actually right now</text>
  <text start="211.03" dur="3.48">we&amp;#39;ll defer your payments or we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="212.89" dur="3.27">modify it so your payments are a little</text>
  <text start="214.51" dur="3.84">bit lower because we understand there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="216.16" dur="4.62">just no jobs out there and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="218.35" dur="5.55">this all over the place we understand</text>
  <text start="220.78" dur="5.61">that the occur real economy does not fit</text>
  <text start="223.9" dur="4.29">the illusion but again those people who</text>
  <text start="226.39" dur="4.409">are making a good living who are just</text>
  <text start="228.19" dur="4.32">working everyday are not really seeing</text>
  <text start="230.799" dur="4.261">it they&amp;#39;re just seeing the stock market</text>
  <text start="232.51" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s going up they hear the hype and the</text>
  <text start="235.06" dur="5.25">corporate media they hear the president</text>
  <text start="237.4" dur="4.92">out there they hare the Fed Chairman out</text>
  <text start="240.31" dur="3.959">there all telling everyone that the</text>
  <text start="242.32" dur="3.78">economy is great they hear the corporate</text>
  <text start="244.269" dur="4.201">media the financial stations saying yes</text>
  <text start="246.1" dur="4.859">these policies are working everything is</text>
  <text start="248.47" dur="5.25">fine I don&amp;#39;t see any unemployment here I</text>
  <text start="250.959" dur="5.28">don&amp;#39;t see bread lines I don&amp;#39;t see people</text>
  <text start="253.72" dur="3.81">with no work and everyone is believing</text>
  <text start="256.239" dur="3.661">it but everything doesn&amp;#39;t really make</text>
  <text start="257.53" dur="6.389">sense because what we see is massive</text>
  <text start="259.9" dur="8.22">amount of layoffs we see retail stores</text>
  <text start="263.919" dur="6.361">closing we see the drop-off of people</text>
  <text start="268.12" dur="5.46">taking out mortgages and now the Chicago</text>
  <text start="270.28" dur="3.99">PMI just missed expectations by the most</text>
  <text start="273.58" dur="3.72">in a year</text>
  <text start="274.27" dur="6.57">and tumbled to its lowest since August</text>
  <text start="277.3" dur="7.23">the employment sub-index collapse 250</text>
  <text start="280.84" dur="6.48">from 59.3 prices pay dropped and new</text>
  <text start="284.53" dur="4.92">orders tumbled to the lowest since</text>
  <text start="287.32" dur="5.07">August so it things are just not going</text>
  <text start="289.45" dur="5.55">well and talking about unemployment</text>
  <text start="292.39" dur="5.43">unemployment right now we really have to</text>
  <text start="295" dur="7.7">look at this now teenagers from the ages</text>
  <text start="297.82" dur="8.64">of 16 to 19 less than 17 percent of</text>
  <text start="302.7" dur="5.86">teenagers in Los Angeles have a job and</text>
  <text start="306.46" dur="4.86">if you really break this down the</text>
  <text start="308.56" dur="5.58">employment rate is actually terrible</text>
  <text start="311.32" dur="5.7">across the country for teenagers it is</text>
  <text start="314.14" dur="6">ranging from 35 all the way up to 43</text>
  <text start="317.02" dur="5.07">percent in many different areas because</text>
  <text start="320.14" dur="4.25">they are trying to look for jobs and</text>
  <text start="322.09" dur="5.28">what&amp;#39;s happening is the older population</text>
  <text start="324.39" dur="6.55">are getting these part-time jobs because</text>
  <text start="327.37" dur="6.18">their retirements are completing much</text>
  <text start="330.94" dur="5.01">level they don&amp;#39;t go up with inflation</text>
  <text start="333.55" dur="3.74">and they&amp;#39;re seeing prices of food go up</text>
  <text start="335.95" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="337.29" dur="4.93">expenses go up electric go up they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="339.91" dur="3.87">saying everything go up except their</text>
  <text start="342.22" dur="3.9">retirement so they need to go out and</text>
  <text start="343.78" dur="5.31">get these part-time jobs and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="346.12" dur="5.58">taking them away from the teenagers at</text>
  <text start="349.09" dur="4.71">this time but college graduates you know</text>
  <text start="351.7" dur="3.69">everyone tells you to go out there go to</text>
  <text start="353.8" dur="4.64">college you could come out you get a</text>
  <text start="355.39" dur="6.84">great job and right now we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="358.44" dur="6.49">260,000 graduates in minimum wage jobs</text>
  <text start="362.23" dur="6.81">now why is that because there are no</text>
  <text start="364.93" dur="7.59">jobs in their major at this time and</text>
  <text start="369.04" dur="6">it&amp;#39;s getting tougher and tougher for</text>
  <text start="372.52" dur="5.07">these college graduates to find work and</text>
  <text start="375.04" dur="4.56">this goes on to say that 260,000 people</text>
  <text start="377.59" dur="4.74">who had a college or professional degree</text>
  <text start="379.6" dur="5.37">made at or below the federal minimum</text>
  <text start="382.33" dur="5.58">wage of 725 per hour last year according</text>
  <text start="384.97" dur="5.46">to the BLS and I&amp;#39;m telling you right now</text>
  <text start="387.91" dur="6.15">this number is probably double of what</text>
  <text start="390.43" dur="6.42">they are actually reporting and the only</text>
  <text start="394.06" dur="5.82">jobs that we&amp;#39;re growing are low-wage</text>
  <text start="396.85" dur="4.32">jobs at this time some 58% of the jobs</text>
  <text start="399.88" dur="3.99">created during the recent economic</text>
  <text start="401.17" dur="5.38">recovery has been low wage positions</text>
  <text start="403.87" dur="6.75">like retail and fruit</text>
  <text start="406.55" dur="7.68">prep work and here&amp;#39;s a real-life example</text>
  <text start="410.62" dur="5.35">a fast food worker Bobby who got a</text>
  <text start="414.23" dur="4.23">bachelor&amp;#39;s degree from University of</text>
  <text start="415.97" dur="6.03">Missouri in Kansas City works for</text>
  <text start="418.46" dur="5.73">part-time low-wage jobs just to barely</text>
  <text start="422" dur="4.74">scrape by and pay for all his student</text>
  <text start="424.19" dur="5.4">loans to pay for his car to pay for</text>
  <text start="426.74" dur="6.09">everything he needs for jobs because he</text>
  <text start="429.59" dur="5.37">cannot find a full-time job at this time</text>
  <text start="432.83" dur="4.92">and he went on to say my family told me</text>
  <text start="434.96" dur="7.89">just get your degree and it will be fine</text>
  <text start="437.75" dur="7.08">but as we know it is not fine at all now</text>
  <text start="442.85" dur="5.19">Fed chairman Yellen was out there again</text>
  <text start="444.83" dur="6.45">saying QE taper doesn&amp;#39;t mean reduce</text>
  <text start="448.04" dur="6.48">stimulus commitment hmm now we</text>
  <text start="451.28" dur="5.25">understand that yes on the face of it it</text>
  <text start="454.52" dur="4.14">looks like they&amp;#39;re tapering but through</text>
  <text start="456.53" dur="4.74">backchannels we understand they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="458.66" dur="4.2">sending money off to Belgium to pay for</text>
  <text start="461.27" dur="3.75">these Treasury bonds that foreign</text>
  <text start="462.86" dur="4.44">nations are selling they are picking up</text>
  <text start="465.02" dur="3.69">the slack also the numbers coming out of</text>
  <text start="467.3" dur="2.94">the Fed we don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="468.71" dur="3.33">absolutely true that they were spending</text>
  <text start="470.24" dur="3.42">eighty five billion there&amp;#39;s reports out</text>
  <text start="472.04" dur="4.29">there saying that they were spending</text>
  <text start="473.66" dur="3.96">more than eighty five billion around a</text>
  <text start="476.33" dur="2.94">hundred to one hundred and twenty five</text>
  <text start="477.62" dur="4.62">billion each month and I bet you a was</text>
  <text start="479.27" dur="5.52">around two hundred billion each month</text>
  <text start="482.24" dur="5.43">and not what they were talking about and</text>
  <text start="484.79" dur="4.35">again what they&amp;#39;re saying is that just</text>
  <text start="487.67" dur="2.73">because they&amp;#39;re tapering doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="489.14" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re going to reduce stimulus whether</text>
  <text start="490.4" dur="4.29">or not actually they&amp;#39;re getting ready to</text>
  <text start="492.35" dur="4.17">up it even more because they&amp;#39;re waiting</text>
  <text start="494.69" dur="3.54">for this incredible event and this is</text>
  <text start="496.52" dur="4.65">why they&amp;#39;re out there telling us that</text>
  <text start="498.23" dur="5.61">the economy is recovering we&amp;#39;re on the</text>
  <text start="501.17" dur="5.37">verge everyone can you see all the jobs</text>
  <text start="503.84" dur="4.38">coming can you see the recovery look the</text>
  <text start="506.54" dur="3.78">stock market&amp;#39;s at all-time new highs</text>
  <text start="508.22" dur="3.33">Gold has been pushed down so that</text>
  <text start="510.32" dur="3.96">doesn&amp;#39;t indicate that anything&amp;#39;s wrong</text>
  <text start="511.55" dur="4.62">and this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to prove</text>
  <text start="514.28" dur="4.77">and again they&amp;#39;re always out there</text>
  <text start="516.17" dur="5.79">telling you this and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="519.05" dur="4.32">Fed takes it 2% inflation go very</text>
  <text start="521.96" dur="3.9">seriously I&amp;#39;m telling you right now</text>
  <text start="523.37" dur="4.26">inflation is much higher than that post</text>
  <text start="525.86" dur="4.89">crisis labor market strengthened</text>
  <text start="527.63" dur="5.55">considerably and again what we are</text>
  <text start="530.75" dur="4.92">seeing is them telling us that this</text>
  <text start="533.18" dur="5.04">economy is recovering but we have to</text>
  <text start="535.67" dur="3.9">remember just because they tell us this</text>
  <text start="538.22" dur="2.79">doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="539.57" dur="4.8">happening because we&amp;#39;re seeing other</text>
  <text start="541.01" dur="5.43">indicators like the pool of seven</text>
  <text start="544.37" dur="5.7">million people who work part-time and</text>
  <text start="546.44" dur="6.63">want full-time jobs is much larger than</text>
  <text start="550.07" dur="5.34">should be expected at a 6.7 unemployment</text>
  <text start="553.07" dur="5.19">rate this is a sign that labor</text>
  <text start="555.41" dur="5.4">conditions are worse than unemployment</text>
  <text start="558.26" dur="4.98">rate indicates so you see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="560.81" dur="5.61">happening here they count part-time as</text>
  <text start="563.24" dur="5.22">full-time jobs so if everyone gets a</text>
  <text start="566.42" dur="4.5">part-time job in the country oh my god</text>
  <text start="568.46" dur="4.89">the unemployment rate is 1% but nobody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="570.92" dur="5.55">making money you can&amp;#39;t afford anything</text>
  <text start="573.35" dur="6.63">you can&amp;#39;t support your family it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="576.47" dur="6.03">work and again this is part of the</text>
  <text start="579.98" dur="4.47">illusion to make everyone believe that</text>
  <text start="582.5" dur="5.16">we are in this incredible recovery</text>
  <text start="584.45" dur="5.16">because they understand that the</text>
  <text start="587.66" dur="3.51">collapse is coming and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="589.61" dur="3.12">maintain this they can&amp;#39;t make it</text>
  <text start="591.17" dur="5.06">maintain this much longer and they</text>
  <text start="592.73" dur="6.96">realize this Europe is falling apart</text>
  <text start="596.23" dur="5.41">America is under an illusion they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="599.69" dur="4.68">trying the central bankers US government</text>
  <text start="601.64" dur="5.67">and the European nations are trying to</text>
  <text start="604.37" dur="5.24">provoke countries to start a war and</text>
  <text start="607.31" dur="5.19">this is what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing all</text>
  <text start="609.61" dur="5.56">across the globe we see it in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="612.5" dur="4.92">they made a power play in Ukraine it</text>
  <text start="615.17" dur="5.49">didn&amp;#39;t work out they made a power play</text>

  <text start="661.93" dur="5.86">certain events are going to occur and</text>
  <text start="664.88" dur="5.31">there is going to be rioting there are</text>

  <text start="677.779" dur="4.141">and this is what their biggest fear at</text>
  <text start="680.509" dur="3.301">this time and this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="681.92" dur="3.779">trying to disarm this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="683.81" dur="3.779">been spying on everyone this is why</text>
  <text start="685.699" dur="3.541">they&amp;#39;ve been making the lists they want</text>
  <text start="687.589" dur="4.591">to know where everyone is so they can</text>
  <text start="689.24" dur="6.75">control or contain this situation the</text>
  <text start="692.18" dur="6.12">best they can and if it means bringing</text>
  <text start="695.99" dur="4.32">people to fema camps and keeping them</text>
  <text start="698.3" dur="5.25">there this is what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>

  <text start="703.55" dur="4.92">spying on everyone well a new report</text>
  <text start="705.44" dur="6.93">came out saying that RSA received about</text>

  <text start="724.94" dur="6.569">generator but it had a deliberate floor</text>
  <text start="727.31" dur="6.92">flaw a back door for the NSA so this</text>
  <text start="731.509" dur="7.2">thing over the over the over the counter</text>
  <text start="734.23" dur="7.03">encryption software has backdoors for</text>
  <text start="738.709" dur="4.711">the NSA so if you go out and you get</text>
  <text start="741.26" dur="3.449">encryption software most likely there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="743.42" dur="3.39">a backdoor and it&amp;#39;s really not</text>

  <text start="746.81" dur="5.009">develop your own and keep the method in</text>
  <text start="748.639" dur="7.621">the key and not commercialize or put it</text>
  <text start="751.819" dur="7.71">out there and again the NSA has paid all</text>
  <text start="756.26" dur="5.72">of these companies to get backdoors into</text>
  <text start="759.529" dur="7.381">all the system cell phones computers</text>
  <text start="761.98" dur="7.78">software websites to make sure they have</text>
  <text start="766.91" dur="5.88">the ability to spy on every single</text>
  <text start="769.76" dur="5.879">person and we also have to understand</text>
  <text start="772.79" dur="5.31">that DHS has been going around to all</text>
  <text start="775.639" dur="6.541">the local law enforcement and giving</text>
  <text start="778.1" dur="7.82">them you know grants funds tanks weapons</text>
  <text start="782.18" dur="6.779">as long as they&amp;#39;re in compliance with</text>
  <text start="785.92" dur="5.05">DHS and right now some police</text>
  <text start="788.959" dur="4.201">departments are being outfitted by the</text>
  <text start="790.97" dur="4.169">federal government will expose the</text>

  <text start="795.139" dur="4.741">obliterate local accountability of law</text>

  <text start="799.88" dur="5.73">dependent on the on DHS</text>
  <text start="804.529" dur="4.321">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now the</text>
  <text start="805.61" dur="6.089">funds that these local law enforcement</text>
  <text start="808.85" dur="5.25">are requesting - they&amp;#39;re using that to</text>
  <text start="811.699" dur="4.56">purchase equipment and training that</text>
  <text start="814.1" dur="4.859">supports regional homeland security</text>
  <text start="816.259" dur="5.721">goals again they have to be in compliant</text>
  <text start="818.959" dur="6.36">and they have to do certain things to</text>
  <text start="821.98" dur="5.5">get these grants from DHS specifically</text>
  <text start="825.319" dur="4.02">an automated license plate reading</text>

  <text start="843.939" dur="5.26">additionally for fire departments and</text>
  <text start="846.199" dur="6.99">also what they&amp;#39;re doing is they also</text>
  <text start="849.199" dur="7.05">have to be in compliance or for urban</text>
  <text start="853.189" dur="5.731">control and riots and keeping the</text>
  <text start="856.249" dur="6.9">population controlled and this is why</text>
  <text start="858.92" dur="7.139">they&amp;#39;re all being set up like this DHS</text>
  <text start="863.149" dur="4.971">across the country has completely</text>
  <text start="866.059" dur="5.491">infiltrated all local law enforcement</text>
  <text start="868.12" dur="5.8">they can work with them and they have a</text>
  <text start="871.55" dur="5.339">central command and this is why they</text>
  <text start="873.92" dur="5.07">have all the states they want all the</text>
  <text start="876.889" dur="5.25">states and compliance with the Real ID</text>
  <text start="878.99" dur="5.49">so this way they can track everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="882.139" dur="4.17">movement because the real ID is your</text>
  <text start="884.48" dur="3.959">driver&amp;#39;s license that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="886.309" dur="4.681">fit with an RFID chip they&amp;#39;re also going</text>
  <text start="888.439" dur="5.13">to take a DNA and iris scan and the</text>
  <text start="890.99" dur="4.349">fingerprint scan and all this is going</text>
  <text start="893.569" dur="4.411">to be uploaded to a federal database and</text>
  <text start="895.339" dur="4.891">of course this will be used at certain</text>
  <text start="897.98" dur="4.469">checkpoints and you will be tracked and</text>
  <text start="900.23" dur="3.359">they will know where you are and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="902.449" dur="5.791">happening in the local law enforcement</text>
  <text start="903.589" dur="6.06">they&amp;#39;re getting funds to spy on cell</text>
  <text start="908.24" dur="3.75">phone calls this is part of their</text>
  <text start="909.649" dur="6.571">compliance they&amp;#39;re getting suitcase size</text>
  <text start="911.99" dur="6.599">stingray cell towers to trick cellphones</text>
  <text start="916.22" dur="4.409">into connecting to it and this way they</text>
  <text start="918.589" dur="4.381">can route your cell phone calls through</text>
  <text start="920.629" dur="5.221">it so they can monitor your calls and</text>
  <text start="922.97" dur="5.52">and see what&amp;#39;s going on and all of this</text>
  <text start="925.85" dur="5.039">cost a lot of money but DHS is providing</text>
  <text start="928.49" dur="3.959">it to local law enforcement as long as</text>
  <text start="930.889" dur="4.111">they are in compliance because they are</text>
  <text start="932.449" dur="4.56">getting prepared for what is coming and</text>
  <text start="935" dur="2.68">they need to track every single person</text>
  <text start="937.009" dur="2.561">and</text>
  <text start="937.68" dur="4.53">and what does this have to do with</text>
  <text start="939.57" dur="5.61">terrorism they have found nothing to do</text>
  <text start="942.21" dur="5.37">or they haven&amp;#39;t found any terrorism they</text>
  <text start="945.18" dur="5.49">haven&amp;#39;t stopped any terrorism and if you</text>
  <text start="947.58" dur="5.52">go to the DHS site their site for the</text>
  <text start="950.67" dur="4.56">alert system is always blank there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="953.1" dur="4.77">warnings or anything ever on there</text>
  <text start="955.23" dur="5.669">because again this is not for outside</text>
  <text start="957.87" dur="5.82">terrorism this is for inside the country</text>
  <text start="960.899" dur="4.891">the domestic terrorists because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="963.69" dur="4.89">protecting the government this is the</text>
  <text start="965.79" dur="6">government police force against the</text>
  <text start="968.58" dur="5.91">people this is what that this has been</text>
  <text start="971.79" dur="5.25">developed for not to protect you from</text>
  <text start="974.49" dur="5.19">outside terrorists it&amp;#39;s to protect the</text>
  <text start="977.04" dur="4.35">government from you the domestic</text>
  <text start="979.68" dur="4.469">terrorists so if you don&amp;#39;t agree with</text>
  <text start="981.39" dur="5.55">the government DHS will come down hard</text>
  <text start="984.149" dur="6.091">on you and this is what this they have</text>
  <text start="986.94" dur="6.269">been developed for now the opposition</text>
  <text start="990.24" dur="5.789">party and Turkey kind of lost the</text>
  <text start="993.209" dur="5.19">election by a slim margin looks like</text>
  <text start="996.029" dur="5.161">Oregon is the president again there were</text>
  <text start="998.399" dur="5.731">no International Committee they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1001.19" dur="5.399">watching the votes again Oregon is the</text>
  <text start="1004.13" dur="6.2">puppet regime of the United States and</text>
  <text start="1006.589" dur="6.151">they were going to let no other type of</text>
  <text start="1010.33" dur="4.42">government get in there they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1012.74" dur="4.17">keep the puppet government because they</text>
  <text start="1014.75" dur="3.6">need to control the country and this</text>
  <text start="1016.91" dur="4.369">goes along with all the other countries</text>
  <text start="1018.35" dur="8.28">that they&amp;#39;re controlling like Libya Iraq</text>
  <text start="1021.279" dur="8.68">Lebanon Yemen in South Africa in a lot</text>
  <text start="1026.63" dur="6.12">of the African nations Thailand Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1029.959" dur="5.071">we see the same pattern all over the</text>
  <text start="1032.75" dur="4.709">place they keep the puppet governments</text>
  <text start="1035.03" dur="7.289">in place and the same things happening</text>
  <text start="1037.459" dur="6.72">in Turkey now to provoke North Korea it</text>
  <text start="1042.319" dur="4.38">looks like South Korea and the United</text>
  <text start="1044.179" dur="4.981">States were having drills and North</text>
  <text start="1046.699" dur="4.711">Korea&amp;#39;s a North Korean shells have</text>
  <text start="1049.16" dur="4.41">landed in South Korea waters prompting</text>
  <text start="1051.41" dur="4.89">Seoul to open fire across a disputed</text>
  <text start="1053.57" dur="6.39">border zone and again this is all being</text>
  <text start="1056.3" dur="5.1">played up again to provoke North Korea</text>
  <text start="1059.96" dur="5.04">because they really want them to do</text>
  <text start="1061.4" dur="5.76">something just like in Ukraine they</text>
  <text start="1065" dur="4.14">would really love Russia to do something</text>
  <text start="1067.16" dur="4.32">they continually provoke provoke they</text>
  <text start="1069.14" dur="5.669">keep beating their their chest about war</text>
  <text start="1071.48" dur="4.89">coming about troops massing in size and</text>
  <text start="1074.809" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re keeping this in front of</text>
  <text start="1076.37" dur="5.52">everyone and again the only people that</text>
  <text start="1079.669" dur="5.241">are talking about war are the central</text>
  <text start="1081.89" dur="5.96">bankers the United States government the</text>
  <text start="1084.91" dur="6.79">acting government in Ukraine which is</text>
  <text start="1087.85" dur="5.35">really non electing government so</text>
  <text start="1091.7" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re just put into place and they</text>
  <text start="1093.2" dur="5.82">were put into place way before the coup</text>
  <text start="1095.96" dur="5.31">d&amp;#39;etat in you in the Ukraine and we can</text>
  <text start="1099.02" dur="4.649">see what is happening they will</text>
  <text start="1101.27" dur="4.11">eventually push this to the next level</text>
  <text start="1103.669" dur="4.26">when I said the central bankers US</text>
  <text start="1105.38" dur="5.75">government there will be a false flag</text>
  <text start="1107.929" dur="8.671">event this is being set up right now and</text>
  <text start="1111.13" dur="9.07">this will be something a lot larger a</text>
  <text start="1116.6" dur="5.85">lot more scary than 9/11 because they</text>
  <text start="1120.2" dur="5.31">need to bring the entire country into</text>
  <text start="1122.45" dur="4.859">the fold of what is about to happen</text>
  <text start="1125.51" dur="5.61">because they need the entire country to</text>
  <text start="1127.309" dur="7.561">say yes let&amp;#39;s go to war because they</text>
  <text start="1131.12" dur="7.11">just attacked us and the they could be</text>
  <text start="1134.87" dur="5.82">North Korea Syria Russia China however</text>
  <text start="1138.23" dur="3.78">this false flag goes I&amp;#39;m going to say</text>
  <text start="1140.69" dur="2.729">it&amp;#39;s going to be it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="1142.01" dur="5.19">little bit easier to say it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1143.419" dur="5.671">be Syria or Iran because they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1147.2" dur="4.349">building up the propaganda it&amp;#39;s easier</text>
  <text start="1149.09" dur="4.38">to make the story from Iran or Syria</text>
  <text start="1151.549" dur="3.421">because they&amp;#39;ve been saying Iran has</text>
  <text start="1153.47" dur="2.82">been having you know they&amp;#39;re developing</text>
  <text start="1154.97" dur="2.88">nuclear weapons they&amp;#39;ve been saying this</text>
  <text start="1156.29" dur="5.16">for a very long time they&amp;#39;re very close</text>
  <text start="1157.85" dur="5.819">they&amp;#39;ve been funding terrorists in Syria</text>
  <text start="1161.45" dur="4.05">and they can either make the story about</text>
  <text start="1163.669" dur="3.75">Syria because they&amp;#39;ve been saying that</text>
  <text start="1165.5" dur="5.13">you know the Syrian electronic army has</text>
  <text start="1167.419" dur="4.801">been attacking the United States Assad</text>
  <text start="1170.63" dur="5.22">has hidden chemical or biological</text>
  <text start="1172.22" dur="4.949">weapons and you can see it the story</text>
  <text start="1175.85" dur="3.3">would be a lot easier</text>
  <text start="1177.169" dur="4.771">Russia and China yes there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="1179.15" dur="5.07">cyberattack stories but there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="1181.94" dur="5.22">major that would actually fit into the</text>

  <text start="1187.16" dur="5.37">does fit they&amp;#39;ve been using this</text>
  <text start="1189.5" dur="5.52">propaganda for a very long time and if</text>
  <text start="1192.53" dur="7.529">something does happen it would fit into</text>
  <text start="1195.02" dur="7.98">their story now China as we know is in</text>

  <text start="2047.87" dur="3.96">building up our missile defenses all</text>
  <text start="2050" dur="5.399">over the place and this is coming from</text>
  <text start="2051.83" dur="5.279">Senator Kelly IOT and she believes we</text>
  <text start="2055.399" dur="3.27">should have missiles in the Czech</text>
  <text start="2057.109" dur="4.05">Republic but the Czech Republic says we</text>
  <text start="2058.669" dur="6.271">know we do not want this in our country</text>
  <text start="2061.159" dur="5.791">at this time now to make things worse</text>
  <text start="2064.94" dur="5.27">John McCain is out there telling</text>
  <text start="2066.95" dur="7.83">everyone that he thinks that US firms</text>
  <text start="2070.21" dur="7.03">must pull out from Russia now we have to</text>
  <text start="2074.78" dur="4.98">really look at what&amp;#39;s going on here most</text>
  <text start="2077.24" dur="4.77">of their business is coming from Russia</text>
  <text start="2079.76" dur="5.73">this is how these corporations are</text>
  <text start="2082.01" dur="7.139">surviving if they close up shop and pull</text>
  <text start="2085.49" dur="5.55">out here in the United States there</text>
  <text start="2089.149" dur="5.131">would be major major problems right off</text>
  <text start="2091.04" dur="4.71">the bat and of course the senator is out</text>
  <text start="2094.28" dur="2.52">there saying the US might need to</text>
  <text start="2095.75" dur="3.869">pressure some of its biggest</text>
  <text start="2096.8" dur="3.74">corporations to suspend their operations</text>
  <text start="2099.619" dur="3.781">in Russia</text>
  <text start="2100.54" dur="4.75">McCain told Bloomberg Television that</text>
  <text start="2103.4" dur="3.6">would be a tough call but the companies</text>
  <text start="2105.29" dur="4.35">like ExxonMobil for General Electric</text>
  <text start="2107" dur="5.03">Pepsi might have to pull out or roll</text>
  <text start="2109.64" dur="4.92">back their presence in Russia if</text>
  <text start="2112.03" dur="5.74">President Putin doesn&amp;#39;t withdraw troops</text>
  <text start="2114.56" dur="7.08">from Ukraine and there are no troops</text>
  <text start="2117.77" dur="6.54">there is nothing there and again they</text>
  <text start="2121.64" dur="5.07">are building this propaganda of course</text>
  <text start="2124.31" dur="4.89">yes they do have troops there battalions</text>
  <text start="2126.71" dur="4.889">of troops because again every country</text>
  <text start="2129.2" dur="3.78">has troops along the borders but these</text>
  <text start="2131.599" dur="3.361">are not troops that are on maneuvers</text>
  <text start="2132.98" dur="3.48">getting ready to invade they are</text>
  <text start="2134.96" dur="2.18">stationed there they&amp;#39;ve always been</text>
  <text start="2136.46" dur="2.599">there</text>
  <text start="2137.14" dur="5.04">they weren&amp;#39;t moved into the area and</text>
  <text start="2139.059" dur="5.401">again this is all propaganda and Germany</text>
  <text start="2142.18" dur="4.26">is very worried about these sanctions</text>
  <text start="2144.46" dur="4.47">that are being put on Russia with at</text>
  <text start="2146.44" dur="4.5">least 300,000 German jobs depending on</text>
  <text start="2148.93" dur="4.109">business relations with Russia it is</text>
  <text start="2150.94" dur="4.169">hardly surprising that several top</text>
  <text start="2153.039" dur="4.201">German executives have criticized the</text>
  <text start="2155.109" dur="4.47">strategy of the US and Europe in dealing</text>
  <text start="2157.24" dur="5.819">with Russia fearing the consequences for</text>
  <text start="2159.579" dur="6.061">their businesses and again you know</text>
  <text start="2163.059" dur="5.161">since Europe doesn&amp;#39;t have raw materials</text>
  <text start="2165.64" dur="4.59">we will always be dependent on others</text>
  <text start="2168.22" dur="3.51">and it seems questionable to me whether</text>
  <text start="2170.23" dur="4.02">dependent on the Middle East or</text>
  <text start="2171.73" dur="5.789">Venezuela would be better than that on</text>
  <text start="2174.25" dur="5.309">Russia at this time and Germany is</text>
  <text start="2177.519" dur="4.741">nervous European is looking to get</text>
  <text start="2179.559" dur="4.081">different resources from different areas</text>
  <text start="2182.26" dur="3.509">because they are very dependent on</text>
  <text start="2183.64" dur="4.26">Russia and if they go forth with any</text>
  <text start="2185.769" dur="4.411">type of sanctions it will have a</text>
  <text start="2187.9" dur="5.1">boomerang effect and bring down the</text>
  <text start="2190.18" dur="5.939">economies of Europe United States</text>
  <text start="2193" dur="4.589">Germany and they really understand this</text>
  <text start="2196.119" dur="4.051">and this is why you don&amp;#39;t see them doing</text>
  <text start="2197.589" dur="5.01">putting sanctions on the actual country</text>
  <text start="2200.17" dur="5.639">itself because they understand that this</text>
  <text start="2202.599" dur="4.381">was completely implode the economies of</text>
  <text start="2205.809" dur="3.81">the United States and the European</text>
  <text start="2206.98" dur="5.49">nations and the people would say you did</text>
  <text start="2209.619" dur="5.521">this you just put sanctions on Russia</text>
  <text start="2212.47" dur="4.53">and our economy is suffering and they</text>
  <text start="2215.14" dur="3.149">will not let that happen and this is why</text>
  <text start="2217" dur="1.609">you&amp;#39;re not seeing them do it at this</text>
  <text start="2218.289" dur="5.101">time</text>
  <text start="2218.609" dur="6.541">now the Ukraine government is out there</text>
  <text start="2223.39" dur="4.77">saying that they want to recruit</text>
  <text start="2225.15" dur="5.109">personnel from private foreign military</text>
  <text start="2228.16" dur="3.869">companies in order to maintain law and</text>
  <text start="2230.259" dur="3.871">order so they want the people disarmed</text>
  <text start="2232.029" dur="4.641">and they want to bring in private</text>
  <text start="2234.13" dur="6.239">mercenaries to maintain law and order</text>
  <text start="2236.67" dur="5.83">hmm and this may suggest that Kiev</text>
  <text start="2240.369" dur="4.261">regime wants to suppress civil protest</text>
  <text start="2242.5" dur="4.41">and discontent of course they do because</text>
  <text start="2244.63" dur="6.209">if they do hold an election they will</text>
  <text start="2246.91" dur="6.51">need other paid mercenaries to be out</text>
  <text start="2250.839" dur="4.051">there to control all the people because</text>
  <text start="2253.42" dur="2.76">they&amp;#39;re not going to they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="2254.89" dur="3.75">to like what they&amp;#39;re seeing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2256.18" dur="5.669">starting to stir I mean that the the</text>
  <text start="2258.64" dur="5.28">government of Ukraine right now is not</text>
  <text start="2261.849" dur="4.98">elected they&amp;#39;ve been put into power all</text>
  <text start="2263.92" dur="6.179">the people are saying is higher energy</text>
  <text start="2266.829" dur="4.201">prices lower wages and the economy</text>
  <text start="2270.099" dur="3.301">suffering</text>
  <text start="2271.03" dur="5.16">a huge amount of debt and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2273.4" dur="4.41">going to have elections well we see why</text>
  <text start="2276.19" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re doing this we see why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2277.81" dur="5.34">disarming the people we see why they</text>
  <text start="2279.64" dur="6.66">want to bring in Blackstone to control</text>
  <text start="2283.15" dur="5.43">the situation and again this is what</text>
  <text start="2286.3" dur="4.02">happens in these type of situation if</text>
  <text start="2288.58" dur="4.65">you look at every country they are</text>
  <text start="2290.32" dur="4.23">controlled there&amp;#39;s a dictatorship they</text>
  <text start="2293.23" dur="3.66">don&amp;#39;t want the people to have the right</text>
  <text start="2294.55" dur="5.46">to vote they wanted to psalm the people</text>
  <text start="2296.89" dur="5.04">to keep these people the central bankers</text>
  <text start="2300.01" dur="4.71">the friends of the central bankers in</text>
  <text start="2301.93" dur="4.86">power to keep control of the country and</text>
  <text start="2304.72" dur="4.77">we see this in every single country it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2306.79" dur="7.2">in Lebanon it&amp;#39;s in Libya it&amp;#39;s in Iraq</text>
  <text start="2309.49" dur="7.17">it&amp;#39;s in Yemen it&amp;#39;s in Sudan it is in</text>
  <text start="2313.99" dur="5.73">Thailand and in Ukraine we see this</text>
  <text start="2316.66" dur="5.46">every single place it is the same exact</text>
  <text start="2319.72" dur="6.03">pattern and this is what we are saying</text>
  <text start="2322.12" dur="6.36">now Russia is making deals with Iraq</text>
  <text start="2325.75" dur="4.95">right now Russia&amp;#39;s oil giant Lukoil has</text>
  <text start="2328.48" dur="4.14">begun pumping crude oil from one of the</text>
  <text start="2330.7" dur="4.38">world&amp;#39;s largest undeveloped oil fields</text>
  <text start="2332.62" dur="4.59">in southern Iraq now again this oil is</text>
  <text start="2335.08" dur="4.17">most likely going to be sold using the</text>
  <text start="2337.21" dur="5.46">US dollar because the puppet government</text>
  <text start="2339.25" dur="4.8">of Iraq is controlled by the central</text>
  <text start="2342.67" dur="4.89">bankers United States government and</text>
  <text start="2344.05" dur="5.25">they are going to sell that oil using</text>
  <text start="2347.56" dur="3.69">the US dollar but eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2349.3" dur="4.26">going to happen is the people who are</text>
  <text start="2351.25" dur="2.88">fighting back are going to take over the</text>
  <text start="2353.56" dur="2.16">country</text>
  <text start="2354.13" dur="4.65">just like what&amp;#39;s happening in Libya they</text>
  <text start="2355.72" dur="4.53">have the the Libyan government out of</text>
  <text start="2358.78" dur="3.54">the Parliament building and in a</text>
  <text start="2360.25" dur="3.57">five-star hotel they&amp;#39;ve taken and</text>
  <text start="2362.32" dur="4.38">controlled most of the ports and oil</text>
  <text start="2363.82" dur="5.67">fields and eventually they will take</text>
  <text start="2366.7" dur="4.47">control of the entire country and when</text>
  <text start="2369.49" dur="3.63">this happens like I said this is when</text>
  <text start="2371.17" dur="4.23">the problems really really start but</text>
  <text start="2373.12" dur="3.54">again the central bankers US government</text>
  <text start="2375.4" dur="3.03">are not going to let this happen they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2376.66" dur="5.64">going to push their agenda forward and</text>
  <text start="2378.43" dur="6.63">get this event started now of course we</text>
  <text start="2382.3" dur="5.75">know in Syria that the rebels are</text>
  <text start="2385.06" dur="5.49">keeping the chemical weapons from being</text>
  <text start="2388.05" dur="6.25">sent out of the country they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2390.55" dur="5.16">trying to disrupt the chain of chemical</text>
  <text start="2394.3" dur="4.08">weapons leaving to make it look like</text>
  <text start="2395.71" dur="4.14">Assad is strolling and right now Russia</text>
  <text start="2398.38" dur="4.32">is at they&amp;#39;re claiming that they are</text>
  <text start="2399.85" dur="4.65">seizing coastal territory because Suren</text>
  <text start="2402.7" dur="3.99">rebels are reject reject</text>

  <text start="2408.82" dur="4.44">country&amp;#39;s chemical disarmament but of</text>
  <text start="2410.74" dur="4.59">course we know they were all the proof</text>
  <text start="2413.26" dur="3.96">is there they have all the evidence that</text>
  <text start="2415.33" dur="4.38">they were doing this and we know for a</text>
  <text start="2417.22" dur="4.38">fact this was their whole entire scheme</text>
  <text start="2419.71" dur="3.39">to make it look like Assad was stalling</text>
  <text start="2421.6" dur="3.27">so they can say he wasn&amp;#39;t keeping up</text>
  <text start="2423.1" dur="4.2">with the agreement they tried so many</text>
  <text start="2424.87" dur="4.11">different tactics right now they tried</text>
  <text start="2427.3" dur="4.47">the war crimes they tried the</text>
  <text start="2428.98" dur="4.83">humanitarian route they tried the Geneva</text>
  <text start="2431.77" dur="6.51">two talks to remove them they tried the</text>

  <text start="2438.28" dur="5.79">just trying everything to bring this war</text>
  <text start="2440.98" dur="5.31">forward to get Assad out of there and to</text>
  <text start="2444.07" dur="4.44">bring in a puppet regime but nothing is</text>
  <text start="2446.29" dur="4.65">working at this time and right now the</text>
  <text start="2448.51" dur="4.59">US House legislators are considering new</text>

  <text start="2454.99" dur="5.25">sanctions on because they can&amp;#39;t put the</text>
  <text start="2457.57" dur="4.56">sanctions on Iran due to nuclear but now</text>
  <text start="2460.24" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re going to use sanctions that have</text>
  <text start="2462.13" dur="6.69">to do with Syria where Iran is supplying</text>
  <text start="2465.04" dur="6.15">the Syrian government with weapons and</text>
  <text start="2468.82" dur="4.8">terrorist activities and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="2471.19" dur="3.72">to push this sanctions through on this</text>
  <text start="2473.62" dur="3.06">and right now there&amp;#39;s no word from the</text>
  <text start="2474.91" dur="3.45">Obama administration on these new</text>
  <text start="2476.68" dur="4.47">sanctions and if these new sanctions go</text>
  <text start="2478.36" dur="5.7">through this could start the war with</text>
  <text start="2481.15" dur="5.01">Iran because the only if you remember</text>
  <text start="2484.06" dur="3.99">back when the president said if you do</text>
  <text start="2486.16" dur="3.66">impose sanctions on Iran</text>
  <text start="2488.05" dur="6.03">the only alternative I&amp;#39;ll have right now</text>
  <text start="2489.82" dur="5.61">is to strike Iran at this time now it</text>
  <text start="2494.08" dur="5.13">looks like John Kerry is being</text>
  <text start="2495.43" dur="6.75">implicated in this false flag event with</text>
  <text start="2499.21" dur="5.97">Turkey and with Turkey where they were</text>
  <text start="2502.18" dur="5.37">going to let a couple military personnel</text>
  <text start="2505.18" dur="4.5">sneak into Syria and fire missiles from</text>
  <text start="2507.55" dur="4.74">Syria into Turkey and it looks like</text>
  <text start="2509.68" dur="4.53">Kerry&amp;#39;s name was mentioned and the</text>
  <text start="2512.29" dur="5.25">translation and if you go to this</text>
  <text start="2514.21" dur="5.22">recording Kerry has said to me okay did</text>
  <text start="2517.54" dur="3.6">you make the decision to strike yet and</text>
  <text start="2519.43" dur="3.45">this was in the recording when they were</text>
  <text start="2521.14" dur="5.1">talking about the false flag event and</text>
  <text start="2522.88" dur="5.25">again this just goes to show you they</text>
  <text start="2526.24" dur="4.65">are trying everything and anything to</text>
  <text start="2528.13" dur="4.86">get this event off the ground and they</text>
  <text start="2530.89" dur="5.72">are not going to stop and this brings me</text>
  <text start="2532.99" dur="5.36">to the Malaysian flight 370 and</text>
  <text start="2536.61" dur="3.57">we are seeing here is we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot</text>
  <text start="2538.35" dur="3.78">of information out there I mean we see</text>
  <text start="2540.18" dur="3.21">this picture and it&amp;#39;s black and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2542.13" dur="3.63">saying oh if you download it to your</text>
  <text start="2543.39" dur="5.28">desktop and you look at the exif data it</text>
  <text start="2545.76" dur="5.58">shows the longitude and latitude and yes</text>
  <text start="2548.67" dur="4.47">it does but you can change that there</text>
  <text start="2551.34" dur="3.27">are tools out there and it doesn&amp;#39;t leave</text>
  <text start="2553.14" dur="3.9">any trace I&amp;#39;ve done it three times</text>
  <text start="2554.61" dur="5.04">already it does not leave any trace that</text>
  <text start="2557.04" dur="5.52">you actually changed it it reports that</text>
  <text start="2559.65" dur="6.36">these are the settings so the date the</text>
  <text start="2562.56" dur="6.51">longitude the latitude again do I</text>
  <text start="2566.01" dur="5.7">believe that the plane did land on Diego</text>
  <text start="2569.07" dur="4.29">Garcia yes I do do I believe these</text>
  <text start="2571.71" dur="3.24">people are being held hostage no I</text>
  <text start="2573.36" dur="3.45">believe they&amp;#39;re all dead at this point</text>
  <text start="2574.95" dur="4.56">I believe that this plane was going to</text>
  <text start="2576.81" dur="4.5">be used and still most likely going to</text>
  <text start="2579.51" dur="3.57">be used with as a some type of false</text>
  <text start="2581.31" dur="3.54">flag event here in the United States</text>
  <text start="2583.08" dur="4.32">either carrying a nuclear payload or</text>
  <text start="2584.85" dur="5.28">some other type of chemical weapon or</text>
  <text start="2587.4" dur="4.32">something like that again this is not</text>
  <text start="2590.13" dur="3.6">just going to be the only false flag</text>
  <text start="2591.72" dur="4.32">part of it this is going what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="2593.73" dur="4.8">be part of a bigger bigger widespread</text>
  <text start="2596.04" dur="4.29">false flag event the multi prong that</text>
  <text start="2598.53" dur="3.75">had to do with cyber attacks nuclear and</text>
  <text start="2600.33" dur="4.05">biological because they really needed to</text>
  <text start="2602.28" dur="3.75">bring this home we&amp;#39;ve already seen the</text>
  <text start="2604.38" dur="3.15">planes flying in the building so this is</text>
  <text start="2606.03" dur="2.67">not what this was going to be this is</text>
  <text start="2607.53" dur="3.72">probably going to be some type of dirty</text>
  <text start="2608.7" dur="4.83">nuke or low-grade nuclear weapon</text>
  <text start="2611.25" dur="4.77">probably on the plane coming into the</text>
  <text start="2613.53" dur="5.97">u.s. we also see reports of the</text>
  <text start="2616.02" dur="6.02">Malaysian flight where there are people</text>
  <text start="2619.5" dur="4.98">on there with these semiconductors and</text>
  <text start="2622.04" dur="3.94">for some reason this is not sitting</text>
  <text start="2624.48" dur="3.39">right with me right now and I&amp;#39;m looking</text>
  <text start="2625.98" dur="3.93">into this and I&amp;#39;m sure many many other</text>
  <text start="2627.87" dur="4.23">people are looking into this this story</text>
  <text start="2629.91" dur="4.71">makes no sense whatsoever at this time</text>
  <text start="2632.1" dur="4.02">that they&amp;#39;re you know all these people</text>
  <text start="2634.62" dur="3.84">would be on the flight they were heading</text>
  <text start="2636.12" dur="3.81">to China with this technology and now</text>
  <text start="2638.46" dur="3.59">there&amp;#39;s one person that had the</text>
  <text start="2639.93" dur="4.35">technology and that&amp;#39;s why you know and</text>
  <text start="2642.05" dur="4.68">how to do with the rothschild and it</text>
  <text start="2644.28" dur="6.51">just seems like this is completely</text>
  <text start="2646.73" dur="6.55">trying to distract everyone from the</text>
  <text start="2650.79" dur="6.57">actual evidence that there is a</text>
  <text start="2653.28" dur="8.25">duplicate plane sitting in Israel that</text>
  <text start="2657.36" dur="5.94">could be used in this false flag event</text>
  <text start="2661.53" dur="3.78">and I believe all these pieces in the</text>
  <text start="2663.3" dur="4.14">ocean and all this all of this is</text>
  <text start="2665.31" dur="4.77">distraction to distract us of what is</text>
  <text start="2667.44" dur="3">actually occurring and I noticed this</text>
  <text start="2670.08" dur="2.73">store</text>
  <text start="2670.44" dur="4.26">Raye all of a sudden came out when the</text>

  <text start="2685.14" dur="4.709">it three times with the XF tool and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2687.99" dur="5.19">very easy to do you can&amp;#39;t even tell that</text>
  <text start="2689.849" dur="5.371">it was changed so this evidence does not</text>
  <text start="2693.18" dur="3.899">seem to hold water at this time in this</text>
  <text start="2695.22" dur="4.05">story is not sitting right with me</text>
  <text start="2697.079" dur="4.861">I do believe there is a false flag event</text>
