  <text start="75.229" dur="4.921">understand that the real estate market</text>
  <text start="77.6" dur="4.8">is completely falling apart it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="80.15" dur="4.079">deteriorating right now and we see this</text>
  <text start="82.4" dur="4.62">in the United States we see it in Canada</text>

  <text start="87.02" dur="2.22">market</text>
  <text start="87.56" dur="4.29">well it&amp;#39;s getting rattled the mortgage</text>
  <text start="89.24" dur="5.64">industry is in turmoil banks are</text>

  <text start="94.88" dur="3.18">Sydney and Melbourne and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="95.899" dur="5.97">starting to fall the bubble is popping</text>
  <text start="98.06" dur="7.949">right now and the numbers that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="101.869" dur="7.711">putting out might not be the real</text>
  <text start="106.009" dur="7.351">numbers because we have Lindsey David of</text>
  <text start="109.58" dur="5.76">elif economics in Sydney who is looking</text>
  <text start="113.36" dur="4.11">into this he&amp;#39;s also exposed the</text>
  <text start="115.34" dur="5.82">misconduct and Australia&amp;#39;s banking</text>
  <text start="117.47" dur="6.81">system in early 2016 and what he noticed</text>
  <text start="121.16" dur="5.75">is that the numbers that they&amp;#39;re putting</text>
  <text start="124.28" dur="6">out the official data from CoreLogic</text>
  <text start="126.91" dur="5.95">saying that city fell by 4.6 percent in</text>
  <text start="130.28" dur="5.07">June compared to a year ago with houses</text>
  <text start="132.86" dur="6.209">prices down 6.2 percent and prices of</text>
  <text start="135.35" dur="7.29">condos down by 0.7 percent well he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="139.069" dur="5.731">saying that it is much worse than those</text>
  <text start="142.64" dur="5.73">numbers that the housing market has</text>
  <text start="144.8" dur="6.18">fallen a lot more somewhere between 11</text>
  <text start="148.37" dur="6.54">and 15 percent over the comparison</text>
  <text start="150.98" dur="6.089">period and he went on to say we stand</text>
  <text start="154.91" dur="4.32">with the view the Sydney housing bubble</text>
  <text start="157.069" dur="4.381">appears to have been pricked and we are</text>
  <text start="159.23" dur="4.77">confident that the house prices will</text>
  <text start="161.45" dur="4.38">continue to fall at a moderate to fast</text>
  <text start="164" dur="3.93">pace over the coming months</text>
  <text start="165.83" dur="4.379">this should eventually have a knock-on</text>
  <text start="167.93" dur="3.66">effect to the banking system and its</text>
  <text start="170.209" dur="4.051">stability and the ability to maintain</text>
  <text start="171.59" dur="4.259">profits furthermore we can expect the</text>
  <text start="174.26" dur="4.17">residential construction sector to feel</text>
  <text start="175.849" dur="5.731">the pressure as more developers come to</text>
  <text start="178.43" dur="5.64">the realization that there is now no</text>
  <text start="181.58" dur="4.31">real profit to be made in falling in a</text>
  <text start="184.07" dur="4.85">falling market</text>
  <text start="185.89" dur="5.85">in a feedback loop economy so reliant on</text>
  <text start="188.92" dur="5.6">rising land prices the risk of eventual</text>
  <text start="191.74" dur="4.95">job losses filtering through the Sydney</text>
  <text start="194.52" dur="4.57">economy appears to be on the increase</text>
  <text start="196.69" dur="7.05">which could easily spill into the</text>
  <text start="199.09" dur="7.16">broader Australian economy and this is</text>
  <text start="203.74" dur="5.58">not the only place we are seeing this</text>
  <text start="206.25" dur="5.53">what is happening here is interest rates</text>
  <text start="209.32" dur="7.82">are moving up the LIBOR rate as we know</text>
  <text start="211.78" dur="9.24">is continually moving up and all these</text>
  <text start="217.14" dur="5.92">illusionary areas where they push these</text>
  <text start="221.02" dur="5.1">bubbles up as high as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="223.06" dur="4.59">to make it seem like the world is doing</text>
  <text start="226.12" dur="4.29">a lot better and they started this back</text>
  <text start="227.65" dur="5.309">in 2008 after the financial crisis they</text>
  <text start="230.41" dur="4.799">had to do something so they had to</text>
  <text start="232.959" dur="3.75">create stress test so people look at the</text>
  <text start="235.209" dur="3.631">banks and say oh look they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="236.709" dur="4.591">stress tests are strong so now we have</text>
  <text start="238.84" dur="4.59">confidence in the banking system oh look</text>
  <text start="241.3" dur="4.11">the housing prices they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="243.43" dur="4.529">move up again we have confident in the</text>
  <text start="245.41" dur="5.1">housing market oh look the GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="247.959" dur="4.231">the unemployment numbers they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="250.51" dur="3">a lot better so they created all these</text>
  <text start="252.19" dur="4.71">different type of illusions they</text>
  <text start="253.51" dur="5.759">manipulated the calculations they pumped</text>
  <text start="256.9" dur="4.559">up these certain markets they created</text>
  <text start="259.269" dur="4.171">stress tests and they made it look like</text>
  <text start="261.459" dur="3.091">everything was great in the meantime</text>
  <text start="263.44" dur="2.91">they were lowering interest rates</text>
  <text start="264.55" dur="3.72">lowering it lowering it lowering it in</text>
  <text start="266.35" dur="4.879">some areas we got into the negative</text>
  <text start="268.27" dur="7.05">territory but during this period of time</text>
  <text start="271.229" dur="8.101">we saw that income growth it collapsed</text>
  <text start="275.32" dur="7.8">and we saw austerity all throughout</text>
  <text start="279.33" dur="5.56">Europe and many other areas because a</text>
  <text start="283.12" dur="4.68">lot of countries were in a lot of debt</text>
  <text start="284.89" dur="5.13">we know the global debt has risen to a</text>
  <text start="287.8" dur="4.29">height where it cannot be sustained</text>
  <text start="290.02" dur="5.76">we know the debt in the US is</text>
  <text start="292.09" dur="5.55">continually rising it&amp;#39;s all happening at</text>
  <text start="295.78" dur="4.41">the same time this is what you can</text>
  <text start="297.64" dur="7.02">expect from a central banking system</text>
  <text start="300.19" dur="8.539">where it&amp;#39;s on its last stage of this</text>
  <text start="304.66" dur="7.56">fake fiat system in the beginning stages</text>
  <text start="308.729" dur="6.611">they have hardly any debt and they can</text>
  <text start="312.22" dur="6.27">print as much as they possibly can and</text>
  <text start="315.34" dur="3.789">devalue the dollar the end stage is</text>
  <text start="318.49" dur="2.349">where</text>
  <text start="319.129" dur="4.05">the debt gets to a point where they</text>
  <text start="320.839" dur="5.01">can&amp;#39;t sustain it anymore they have to</text>
  <text start="323.179" dur="5.48">continually print to keep the entire</text>
  <text start="325.849" dur="6.99">system operational they can&amp;#39;t allow this</text>
  <text start="328.659" dur="6.43">fiat money to come into the into the</text>
  <text start="332.839" dur="4.29">public hands because if that happens you</text>
  <text start="335.089" dur="4.29">see inflation so they need to stuff it</text>
  <text start="337.129" dur="6.36">away in certain areas stock market</text>
  <text start="339.379" dur="6">housing market health insurance and they</text>
  <text start="343.489" dur="5.94">put a lot of this money into the banks</text>
  <text start="345.379" dur="6.51">and during this period of time in the</text>
  <text start="349.429" dur="4.95">beginning stages we see that wages they</text>
  <text start="351.889" dur="4.62">increase housing increases we see</text>
  <text start="354.379" dur="4.02">inflation we see higher interest rates</text>
  <text start="356.509" dur="3.481">at the end of the cycle we see the</text>
  <text start="358.399" dur="5.04">opposite that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="359.99" dur="8.009">now and we see that real average hourly</text>
  <text start="363.439" dur="6.99">earnings well they are declining they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="367.999" dur="4.89">not improving they are getting worse in</text>
  <text start="370.429" dur="5.04">fact for the last two months real</text>
  <text start="372.889" dur="6.69">average hourly earnings growth has been</text>
  <text start="375.469" dur="7.98">unchanged on a year-over-year basis so</text>
  <text start="379.579" dur="7.23">at the end part of a central banking</text>
  <text start="383.449" dur="5.82">system we actually see the opposite of</text>
  <text start="386.809" dur="4.26">what happened in the beginning of their</text>
  <text start="389.269" dur="3.12">system and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="391.069" dur="5.97">right now and what they need to do is</text>
  <text start="392.389" dur="7.32">they need to hide or change their data</text>
  <text start="397.039" dur="4.62">and we see the Fed doing this right now</text>
  <text start="399.709" dur="4.85">actually we have manoosh in out there</text>
  <text start="401.659" dur="6.6">saying yield curve is not indicating any</text>
  <text start="404.559" dur="6.4">type of recession now what&amp;#39;s crazy about</text>
  <text start="408.259" dur="5.43">this is we&amp;#39;ve heard this before we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="410.959" dur="5.46">heard individuals back in 2008 like Ben</text>
  <text start="413.689" dur="5.22">Bernanke say that were not forecasting</text>
  <text start="416.419" dur="5.4">any type of recession manoosh ins out</text>
  <text start="418.909" dur="7.44">they are saying the yo curve is not</text>
  <text start="421.819" dur="7.44">indicating any type of recession now of</text>
  <text start="426.349" dur="3.66">course we know it is we know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="429.259" dur="3.51">happening here</text>
  <text start="430.009" dur="4.47">we know the Fed just changed the yield</text>
  <text start="432.769" dur="4.83">curve and there we&amp;#39;ll be able to control</text>
  <text start="434.479" dur="5.37">it they&amp;#39;ll be able to move it in another</text>
  <text start="437.599" dur="4.53">direction they want it to go and people</text>
  <text start="439.849" dur="5.761">will look at this and say ah okay it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="442.129" dur="6.09">not reporting a recession until the</text>
  <text start="445.61" dur="4.139">recession hits just like in 2008 when</text>
  <text start="448.219" dur="3.54">everyone thought there was going to be</text>
  <text start="449.749" dur="2.85">no recession whatsoever reports were</text>
