  <text start="90.5" dur="4.08">out a lot more propaganda and how do you</text>
  <text start="92.3" dur="5.04">know it&amp;#39;s propaganda when you read these</text>
  <text start="94.58" dur="4.5">articles and you really look into it you</text>
  <text start="97.34" dur="3.72">need to look for the proof you need to</text>
  <text start="99.08" dur="3.42">look to what they&amp;#39;re citing and most of</text>
  <text start="101.06" dur="3.21">the times they say well this person said</text>
  <text start="102.5" dur="4.41">this they&amp;#39;re anonymous that person said</text>

  <text start="116.929" dur="3.901">have anything like that which is</text>
  <text start="118.97" dur="3.72">absolutely meaningless and this is what</text>
  <text start="120.83" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;ve been using for a very long time</text>
  <text start="122.69" dur="5.28">their use they use propaganda but they</text>
  <text start="125.84" dur="4.889">never have any type of proof to back</text>
  <text start="127.97" dur="5.099">anything up and the latest article</text>
  <text start="130.729" dur="4.831">that&amp;#39;s out there is that in June of last</text>
  <text start="133.069" dur="5.371">year of Trump demanded count Special</text>
  <text start="135.56" dur="5.759">Counsel Robert Mueller to be fired but</text>
  <text start="138.44" dur="6.03">he changed course after the White House</text>
  <text start="141.319" dur="6.091">Counsel threatened to quit if he ordered</text>
  <text start="144.47" dur="5.91">the firing of Mueller and that comes out</text>
  <text start="147.41" dur="5.4">the New York Times and this is what</text>
  <text start="150.38" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;ve said the west wing confrontation</text>
  <text start="152.81" dur="3.75">marks the first time mr. Trump it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="155.36" dur="3.48">funny how they don&amp;#39;t say President Trump</text>
  <text start="156.56" dur="5.1">is known to have tried to fire the</text>
  <text start="158.84" dur="4.979">special counsel mr. Mueller learned</text>
  <text start="161.66" dur="3.75">about the episode in recent month as his</text>
  <text start="163.819" dur="3.571">investigators interviewed current and</text>
  <text start="165.41" dur="4.14">former senior White House officials in</text>
  <text start="167.39" dur="3.27">his inquiry into whether the president</text>
  <text start="169.55" dur="3.48">obstructed justice</text>
  <text start="170.66" dur="4.68">I mean amid the first wave of news media</text>
  <text start="173.03" dur="4.65">reports that mr. Bueller was examining a</text>
  <text start="175.34" dur="4.649">possible obstruction case the president</text>
  <text start="177.68" dur="4.07">began to argue that mr. Mueller had</text>
  <text start="179.989" dur="4.411">three conflicts of interest that</text>
  <text start="181.75" dur="3.5">disqualified him from overseeing the</text>
  <text start="184.4" dur="3.28">investigation</text>
  <text start="185.25" dur="4.38">two of the people said listen two of the</text>
  <text start="187.68" dur="4.83">people said could be nine of the people</text>
  <text start="189.63" dur="4.89">said show us the recording show us the</text>
  <text start="192.51" dur="4.17">proof show us a written document show</text>
  <text start="194.52" dur="3.84">something now we need to also understand</text>
  <text start="196.68" dur="3.63">that Trump already came out and he said</text>
  <text start="198.36" dur="4.68">this multiple times that he has no</text>
  <text start="200.31" dur="5.37">problem meeting with Muller talking with</text>
  <text start="203.04" dur="4.65">him even under oath makes no difference</text>
  <text start="205.68" dur="4.5">and we know mule why Muller wants this</text>
  <text start="207.69" dur="5.34">because he wants to catch the president</text>
  <text start="210.18" dur="5.94">in a lie but if we go back in time there</text>
  <text start="213.03" dur="4.92">was a congresswoman who claimed that</text>
  <text start="216.12" dur="4.589">Trump was going to fire Robert Mueller</text>
  <text start="217.95" dur="6.36">on December 22nd and we know that</text>
  <text start="220.709" dur="7.5">December 22nd has come and gone and this</text>
  <text start="224.31" dur="6.72">didn&amp;#39;t happen what is the deep state</text>
  <text start="228.209" dur="5.761">doing well they&amp;#39;re throwing out anything</text>
  <text start="231.03" dur="6.48">they possibly can to distract everyone</text>
  <text start="233.97" dur="6.03">away from the fisa memo and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="237.51" dur="3.93">gonna continually push more and more of</text>
  <text start="240" dur="4.38">these ridiculous stories now Trump came</text>
  <text start="241.44" dur="4.76">out less than 12 hours later and said</text>
  <text start="244.38" dur="6.23">that the New York Times report is</text>
  <text start="246.2" dur="8.56">completely fake he denies all of it and</text>
  <text start="250.61" dur="5.83">once again he&amp;#39;s calling them out and if</text>
  <text start="254.76" dur="4.59">all he has to do is where&amp;#39;s the proof</text>
  <text start="256.44" dur="5.64">where did I say this where is the</text>
  <text start="259.35" dur="4.35">recording where is the document where is</text>
  <text start="262.08" dur="3.75">the things that I started to put</text>
  <text start="263.7" dur="4.11">together to fire him where is any of</text>
  <text start="265.83" dur="3.99">that information and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="267.81" dur="4.83">gonna come up with nothing all this he</text>
  <text start="269.82" dur="5.4">said she said all these different things</text>
  <text start="272.64" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re meaningless think about it what</text>
  <text start="275.22" dur="4.77">does it really mean if they come out and</text>
  <text start="277.53" dur="3.51">they say that oh he was thinking about</text>
  <text start="279.99" dur="3.51">firing him</text>
  <text start="281.04" dur="4.98">who cares he&amp;#39;s still there he didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="283.5" dur="6.09">it it makes no difference but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="286.02" dur="6.09">using it to create emotion that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="289.59" dur="4.05">the intelligent agencies do that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="292.11" dur="4.11">the corporate media does that&amp;#39;s what the</text>
  <text start="293.64" dur="5.25">cabal does they put out stories that</text>
  <text start="296.22" dur="5.67">create emotion get everyone emotionally</text>
  <text start="298.89" dur="5.25">charged and that&amp;#39;s all they have and</text>
  <text start="301.89" dur="4.08">then when you cut through the emotional</text>
  <text start="304.14" dur="3.81">part and you say okay let&amp;#39;s put that</text>
  <text start="305.97" dur="4.05">aside and you look at the proof you look</text>
  <text start="307.95" dur="6.96">at the facts that&amp;#39;s where it always</text>
  <text start="310.02" dur="8.63">falls apart now on the other side what</text>
  <text start="314.91" dur="5.75">does Trump have what does these</text>
  <text start="318.65" dur="5.07">individuals in government have that are</text>
  <text start="320.66" dur="4.74">going after the Cabal what do they have</text>
  <text start="323.72" dur="4.23">what they have written documents signed</text>
  <text start="325.4" dur="5.31">by these individuals they have proof</text>
  <text start="327.95" dur="5.61">because they have texts they have a FISA</text>
  <text start="330.71" dur="4.95">memo they have the emails from Clinton</text>
  <text start="333.56" dur="3.84">they have the information from the</text>
  <text start="335.66" dur="3.9">uranium one deal think about what they</text>
  <text start="337.4" dur="4.68">have compared what the corporate media</text>
  <text start="339.56" dur="4.97">is putting out their propaganda with</text>
  <text start="342.08" dur="5.79">nothing to back it up all the</text>
  <text start="344.53" dur="6.82">documentation all the proof all the text</text>
  <text start="347.87" dur="6.66">messages all the information they could</text>
  <text start="351.35" dur="6.36">ever want to show that these people were</text>
  <text start="354.53" dur="6.21">involved in all of this and we see</text>
  <text start="357.71" dur="4.8">already that the FBI lied to</text>
  <text start="360.74" dur="5.55">congressional investigators basically</text>
  <text start="362.51" dur="6.75">the FBI lied to the people under oath</text>
  <text start="366.29" dur="5.79">why did they lie how did they lie they</text>
  <text start="369.26" dur="5.46">said that they could not find that text</text>
  <text start="372.08" dur="4.22">messages between stroke and page it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="374.72" dur="5.46">impossible we don&amp;#39;t know where they are</text>
  <text start="376.3" dur="8.05">we can&amp;#39;t retrieve them but that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="380.18" dur="7.16">true a former FBI Special Agent who</text>
  <text start="384.35" dur="7.53">worked extensively on counterterrorism</text>
  <text start="387.34" dur="8.41">stated the following he was dumbfounded</text>
  <text start="391.88" dur="8.57">by the FBI&amp;#39;s excuse that the text</text>
  <text start="395.75" dur="7.23">messages were irretrievable why because</text>
  <text start="400.45" dur="5.41">even though the servers lost the text</text>
  <text start="402.98" dur="5.21">messages of stroke and page all they</text>
  <text start="405.86" dur="6.27">have to do is go to the actual device</text>
  <text start="408.19" dur="6.48">even if they deleted all the pages guess</text>
  <text start="412.13" dur="5.07">what they still can be recovered</text>
  <text start="414.67" dur="4.89">he says that&amp;#39;s how we catch the bad guys</text>
  <text start="417.2" dur="5.07">we forensic ly search their phones</text>
  <text start="419.56" dur="4.21">nothing disappears off the device the</text>
  <text start="422.27" dur="3.66">only way to make it disappear off the</text>
  <text start="423.77" dur="3.93">device is if you take a hammer to it and</text>
  <text start="425.93" dur="4.74">you smash it into tiny little pieces or</text>
  <text start="427.7" dur="7.68">you microwave it maybe even light it on</text>
  <text start="430.67" dur="9.42">fire so the question is the FBI they</text>
  <text start="435.38" dur="6.33">know this so why did they lie why did</text>
  <text start="440.09" dur="3.6">they mislead Congress why did they</text>
  <text start="441.71" dur="5.04">mislead the American people</text>
  <text start="443.69" dur="5.07">I mean Mueller is out there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="446.75" dur="3.66">saying that man afford and he&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="448.76" dur="3.689">to catch Trump and a lie telling that</text>
  <text start="450.41" dur="5.339">these people lied well</text>
  <text start="452.449" dur="5.821">didn&amp;#39;t they lie shouldn&amp;#39;t they be held</text>
  <text start="455.749" dur="5.6">accountable it&amp;#39;s amazing now out of</text>
  <text start="458.27" dur="6.569">these text messages we&amp;#39;ve come to learn</text>
  <text start="461.349" dur="6.9">that between stroke and page they have</text>
  <text start="464.839" dur="5.85">revealed that the agency&amp;#39;s top brass was</text>
  <text start="468.249" dur="5.17">considering appointing former US</text>
  <text start="470.689" dur="5.25">Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald as Special</text>
  <text start="473.419" dur="4.381">Counsel in the Hillary Clinton email</text>
  <text start="475.939" dur="4.681">investigation they were going to</text>
  <text start="477.8" dur="5.489">actually investigate all of this the</text>
  <text start="480.62" dur="6.68">idea was pitched in March of 26 2016 and</text>
  <text start="483.289" dur="7.74">this was in the text messages and they</text>
  <text start="487.3" dur="6.97">basically backed out of it because why</text>
  <text start="491.029" dur="6.211">they were afraid of the backlash from</text>
  <text start="494.27" dur="7.35">Clinton they were afraid that if she</text>
  <text start="497.24" dur="7.229">became president guess what they would</text>
  <text start="501.62" dur="5.519">be in trouble this is why they backed</text>
  <text start="504.469" dur="3.961">off they recommended to the Department</text>
  <text start="507.139" dur="4.83">of Justice that we shouldn&amp;#39;t investigate</text>
  <text start="508.43" dur="8.459">and we can see right now that all of</text>
  <text start="511.969" dur="8.55">this is tied into everything email the</text>
  <text start="516.889" dur="7.111">pages the Russian collusion the uranium</text>
  <text start="520.519" dur="6.18">one deal the FISA memo everything is all</text>
  <text start="524" dur="6.209">interconnected and it&amp;#39;s the same exact</text>
  <text start="526.699" dur="5.731">players and the whole thing&amp;#39;s starting</text>
  <text start="530.209" dur="3.901">to fall apart even though the corporate</text>
  <text start="532.43" dur="4.529">media is out there saying the walls are</text>
  <text start="534.11" dur="4.349">closing in on Trump no really what</text>
  <text start="536.959" dur="3.391">they&amp;#39;re saying and remember it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="538.459" dur="5">the opposite of what they say the walls</text>
  <text start="540.35" dur="7.26">are closing in on them remember Trump</text>
  <text start="543.459" dur="7.481">they have everything they have the text</text>
  <text start="547.61" dur="6.06">messages they have all emails they have</text>
  <text start="550.94" dur="5.49">everything the NSA has they have all of</text>
  <text start="553.67" dur="5.039">it in documentation they have the FISA</text>
  <text start="556.43" dur="5.459">memo with everyone signing it they have</text>
  <text start="558.709" dur="5.961">all of this information no matter how</text>
  <text start="561.889" dur="5.7">hard they tried to hide it guess what</text>
  <text start="564.67" dur="6.34">you can&amp;#39;t because he has access to</text>
  <text start="567.589" dur="7.351">pretty much everything and everything is</text>
  <text start="571.01" dur="7.35">being presented to him now we can see</text>
  <text start="574.94" dur="5.37">that the cabal over time and we went</text>
  <text start="578.36" dur="3.93">through this you know many many times</text>
  <text start="580.31" dur="5.53">about free speech and how they were</text>
  <text start="582.29" dur="5.53">trying to politically correct us and BAE</text>
  <text start="585.84" dur="4.23">they make us into morons where we</text>
  <text start="587.82" dur="5.88">couldn&amp;#39;t speak the way we really feel</text>
  <text start="590.07" dur="4.35">and make sure that we didn&amp;#39;t speak</text>
  <text start="593.7" dur="2.49">freely</text>
  <text start="594.42" dur="4.02">and that&amp;#39;s why they came up with hate</text>
  <text start="596.19" dur="5.16">speech this is why they said we have to</text>
  <text start="598.44" dur="5.13">control this this was all about getting</text>
  <text start="601.35" dur="4.59">rid of our rights that was the main</text>
  <text start="603.57" dur="4.35">focus of all this because the only way</text>
  <text start="605.94" dur="4.04">they can control the population is to</text>
  <text start="607.92" dur="5.58">make sure the population doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="609.98" dur="6.25">rights now I know we were born with them</text>
  <text start="613.5" dur="4.53">I know that they can&amp;#39;t remove them or</text>
  <text start="616.23" dur="4.68">take them away but for the general</text>
  <text start="618.03" dur="4.53">public they can try to convince you they</text>
  <text start="620.91" dur="3.48">can even put it on the books where</text>
  <text start="622.56" dur="3.51">rights or privileges and the government</text>
  <text start="624.39" dur="3.54">can take them away they can do all of</text>
  <text start="626.07" dur="3.69">that I mean I know it means nothing but</text>
  <text start="627.93" dur="5.25">a lot of people would be convinced of</text>
  <text start="629.76" dur="6">this but once again this was their</text>
  <text start="633.18" dur="4.11">mission and colleges they were on board</text>
  <text start="635.76" dur="3.15">with this I mean look at Berkeley look</text>
  <text start="637.29" dur="3.54">at many of these colleges and we see the</text>
  <text start="638.91" dur="3.3">Department of Justice right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="640.83" dur="5.34">saying that they&amp;#39;re not going to stand</text>
  <text start="642.21" dur="5.76">idly by as these colleges crush free</text>
  <text start="646.17" dur="3.48">speech and they&amp;#39;re going to be looking</text>
  <text start="647.97" dur="4.41">into what they&amp;#39;ve been doing because</text>
  <text start="649.65" dur="4.44">again they&amp;#39;re having these you know free</text>
  <text start="652.38" dur="4.53">speech zones there&amp;#39;s no such thing as</text>
  <text start="654.09" dur="5.13">these things they&amp;#39;re all made up to make</text>
  <text start="656.91" dur="4.83">us believe that this is the only place</text>
  <text start="659.22" dur="5.49">we can have free speech and we need to</text>
  <text start="661.74" dur="5.13">understand that everything that the</text>
  <text start="664.71" dur="4.47">Kabam have been trying to do over a</text>
  <text start="666.87" dur="5.22">period of time get rid of the weapons</text>
  <text start="669.18" dur="4.5">make sure that people won&amp;#39;t speak freely</text>
  <text start="672.09" dur="4.56">make sure they understand they have to</text>
  <text start="673.68" dur="6.72">speak in the free speech zones like in</text>
  <text start="676.65" dur="6.27">the Bundy ranch crisis they had the free</text>
  <text start="680.4" dur="3.81">speech area and they had a fence around</text>
  <text start="682.92" dur="3.36">it and they said this is where you can</text>
  <text start="684.21" dur="4.47">protest and stuff like that which is</text>
  <text start="686.28" dur="4.8">absolutely ridiculous because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="688.68" dur="5.22">nothing like that it doesn&amp;#39;t exist and</text>
  <text start="691.08" dur="5.79">actually nobody even went into it and it</text>
  <text start="693.9" dur="5.28">didn&amp;#39;t work we see out in Ukraine the</text>
  <text start="696.87" dur="4.59">storm clouds are gathering and it looks</text>
  <text start="699.18" dur="4.65">like they&amp;#39;re gonna try to do something</text>
  <text start="701.46" dur="6.26">because the reason the reason I say this</text>
  <text start="703.83" dur="5.97">is because the economy in Ukraine is</text>
  <text start="707.72" dur="5.2">deteriorating very very quickly remember</text>
  <text start="709.8" dur="5.43">the United States the Cabal had regime</text>
  <text start="712.92" dur="4.28">change Victoria Nuland headed it up</text>
  <text start="715.23" dur="3.88">spent about five billion dollars and</text>
  <text start="717.2" dur="5.48">they got</text>
  <text start="719.11" dur="6.45">the elected president yanukovych out of</text>
  <text start="722.68" dur="5.029">office they put the puppet government in</text>
  <text start="725.56" dur="5.37">office right now it&amp;#39;s poroshenko and</text>
  <text start="727.709" dur="6.671">Crimea voted themselves away South the</text>
  <text start="730.93" dur="6">southern the southeast part of Ukraine</text>
  <text start="734.38" dur="3.75">said listen we don&amp;#39;t want to have</text>
  <text start="736.93" dur="2.37">anything to do with the puppet</text>
  <text start="738.13" dur="3.99">government we want to be separate and</text>
  <text start="739.3" dur="5.31">apart and this is how the war all</text>
  <text start="742.12" dur="5.58">started and again</text>
  <text start="744.61" dur="5.219">they stole all their gold they destroyed</text>
  <text start="747.7" dur="5.579">their economy they put them into a huge</text>
  <text start="749.829" dur="5.401">amount of debt and the entire economy is</text>
  <text start="753.279" dur="4.56">falling apart right now they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="755.23" dur="5.19">that inflation is around 12 to 16</text>
  <text start="757.839" dur="3.961">percent and this is of course coming</text>
  <text start="760.42" dur="4.08">from the central bank and things like</text>
  <text start="761.8" dur="5.94">that but the true inflation there is</text>
  <text start="764.5" dur="6.12">most likely around 17 percent or even</text>
  <text start="767.74" dur="6.69">higher and the people are suffering</text>
  <text start="770.62" dur="6.029">they&amp;#39;re even making deals with Russia to</text>
  <text start="774.43" dur="3.54">get coal into the country this is how</text>
  <text start="776.649" dur="3.241">desperate they&amp;#39;re getting and I think</text>
  <text start="777.97" dur="3.859">what&amp;#39;s going to happen right now is as</text>
  <text start="779.89" dur="4.22">the economy deteriorates even further</text>
  <text start="781.829" dur="4.271">they&amp;#39;re gonna have to distract everyone</text>
  <text start="784.11" dur="4.81">probably with going after these</text>
  <text start="786.1" dur="6.38">southeastern people in Ukraine and this</text>
  <text start="788.92" dur="6.21">is why the u.s. the Cabal has placed</text>
  <text start="792.48" dur="4.93">soldiers there to train them and to do</text>
  <text start="795.13" dur="4.5">things so that&amp;#39;s another hot spot that</text>
  <text start="797.41" dur="3.72">we need to look at and that might be the</text>
  <text start="799.63" dur="4.23">next thing that&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="801.13" dur="5.31">Qatar is out there and this is the home</text>
  <text start="803.86" dur="5.099">of CENTCOM headquarters they&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="806.44" dur="5.7">they&amp;#39;re in talks with Russia right now</text>
  <text start="808.959" dur="5.19">to purchase the s400 missile air defense</text>
  <text start="812.14" dur="3.059">system which is very interesting because</text>
  <text start="814.149" dur="3.901">I see Egypt</text>
  <text start="815.199" dur="4.741">I see Iran guitar all these countries</text>
  <text start="818.05" dur="3.99">are purchasing the s400 now maybe</text>
  <text start="819.94" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re looking at the US weapons saying</text>
  <text start="822.04" dur="3.169">uh the u.s. weapons don&amp;#39;t work but I</text>
  <text start="824.05" dur="3.719">think they&amp;#39;re purchasing the</text>
  <text start="825.209" dur="5.38">russian-made weapons because they</text>
  <text start="827.769" dur="4.711">understand that they can really protect</text>
  <text start="830.589" dur="5.161">themselves with these weapons because</text>
  <text start="832.48" dur="5.94">they really work secondly they realize</text>
  <text start="835.75" dur="4.649">that the Cabal might come after them and</text>
  <text start="838.42" dur="4.05">they want to protect their country and</text>
  <text start="840.399" dur="9.3">this is why most of these countries like</text>
  <text start="842.47" dur="9.96">Syria Iran India and guitar now Saudi</text>
  <text start="849.699" dur="5.58">Arabia they&amp;#39;re all purchasing</text>
  <text start="852.43" dur="6.719">the s400 air defense system to protect</text>
  <text start="855.279" dur="6.991">their country from who the Cabal</text>
  <text start="859.149" dur="5.971">because we can see that the Cabal is</text>
  <text start="862.27" dur="5.069">going to be very very angry with these</text>
  <text start="865.12" dur="5.159">countries because they&amp;#39;re going against</text>
  <text start="867.339" dur="5.521">everything they worked for and we can</text>
  <text start="870.279" dur="3.151">see that most likely this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="872.86" dur="2.97">doing it</text>
  <text start="873.43" dur="4.969">we see the Syrian Kurds well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="875.83" dur="7.379">going to share the fate as all the other</text>
  <text start="878.399" dur="7.091">cabal allies it looks like the Syrian</text>
  <text start="883.209" dur="4.861">government will be taking over the Kurd</text>
  <text start="885.49" dur="4.68">region the Cabal will be pushed out of</text>
  <text start="888.07" dur="3.45">there the Kurds have already made the</text>
  <text start="890.17" dur="4.38">call this was the plan from the</text>
  <text start="891.52" dur="7.379">beginning and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="894.55" dur="6.21">this whole entire operation was to get</text>
  <text start="898.899" dur="5.551">rid of the Cabal because how do you get</text>
  <text start="900.76" dur="5.67">rid of the Cabal that is set up in the</text>
  <text start="904.45" dur="4.41">Kurd region with a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="906.43" dur="5.04">weapons Trump already tried to stop the</text>
  <text start="908.86" dur="3.9">funding to all the Kurd soldiers there</text>
  <text start="911.47" dur="2.64">was no more funding going there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="912.76" dur="3">more funding on to the moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="914.11" dur="5.01">the Islamic state was beating the</text>
  <text start="915.76" dur="6.39">al-qaida pretty much gone and the Cabal</text>
  <text start="919.12" dur="4.95">has set up shop inside of the Kurdistan</text>
  <text start="922.15" dur="6.09">region how to get rid of them</text>
  <text start="924.07" dur="7.8">well break them down make the Kurds ask</text>
  <text start="928.24" dur="6.39">for Assad&amp;#39;s help have the Syrian army</text>
  <text start="931.87" dur="6.42">come into the Kurd region and have the</text>
  <text start="934.63" dur="5.97">Kurds admit their part of Syria I mean</text>
  <text start="938.29" dur="4.5">game over that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="940.6" dur="7.4">unless they do something and push</text>
  <text start="942.79" dur="7.38">something now Russia is saying that the</text>
  <text start="948" dur="5.8">equipment that the terrorists have been</text>
  <text start="950.17" dur="6.12">using they are using radio electronic</text>
  <text start="953.8" dur="4.86">equipment made in Europe and we know</text>
  <text start="956.29" dur="3.66">that they get the Toyota trucks we know</text>
  <text start="958.66" dur="3.179">now that they&amp;#39;re getting the radio</text>
  <text start="959.95" dur="2.759">electronic equipment we know that they</text>
  <text start="961.839" dur="3.811">have sarin gas</text>
  <text start="962.709" dur="5.461">we know they have chlorine gas basically</text>
  <text start="965.65" dur="4.41">the US and the coalition forces have</text>
  <text start="968.17" dur="5.76">been supplying the terrorists with</text>
  <text start="970.06" dur="6.87">everything to push their agenda and all</text>
  <text start="973.93" dur="5.19">of it is coming out now now I wanted to</text>
  <text start="976.93" dur="5.37">turn towards the Doomsday Clock right</text>
  <text start="979.12" dur="6.15">now because it moved 30 seconds closer</text>
  <text start="982.3" dur="3.87">to midnight the closest to the symbolic</text>
  <text start="985.27" dur="2.879">point of an</text>
  <text start="986.17" dur="5.64">elation that the clock has been since</text>
  <text start="988.149" dur="5.43">1953 at the height of the Cold War now</text>
  <text start="991.81" dur="4.92">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this is</text>
  <text start="993.579" dur="4.5">that we had the Hawaiian alert system go</text>
  <text start="996.73" dur="4.289">off saying that there was an incoming</text>
  <text start="998.079" dur="4.681">missile we also have the Superbowl</text>
  <text start="1001.019" dur="3.091">coming up and I know every year everyone</text>
  <text start="1002.76" dur="3.66">makes different predictions about the</text>
  <text start="1004.11" dur="4.83">Superbowl because we&amp;#39;ve seen other</text>
  <text start="1006.42" dur="4.859">events happen at you know these big</text>
  <text start="1008.94" dur="5.12">gatherings you know concerts and things</text>
  <text start="1011.279" dur="7.141">like that and certain things happen and</text>
  <text start="1014.06" dur="6.639">we can see that it looks like everything</text>
  <text start="1018.42" dur="4.83">is lining up for a fall flag now not</text>
  <text start="1020.699" dur="5.88">saying it&amp;#39;s going to happen but there</text>
  <text start="1023.25" dur="8.37">are strange things happening with this</text>
  <text start="1026.579" dur="7.581">Super Bowl the US Bank Stadium fired its</text>
  <text start="1031.62" dur="6.89">security provider and replaced it with</text>
  <text start="1034.16" dur="7.69">g4s this is the black ops CIA</text>
  <text start="1038.51" dur="7.6">g4s is the company that employed Omar</text>
  <text start="1041.85" dur="6.39">Mateen remember him Omar Mateen he&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1046.11" dur="6.18">patsy blamed for the orlando nightclub</text>
  <text start="1048.24" dur="6.63">shooting another warning sign the</text>
  <text start="1052.29" dur="7.889">company that engineered u.s. Bank</text>
  <text start="1054.87" dur="7.47">Stadium is into disaster relief SMG</text>
  <text start="1060.179" dur="4.62">which runs venue management for US Bank</text>
  <text start="1062.34" dur="5.91">Stadium also manages events at</text>
  <text start="1064.799" dur="6.681">Manchester Arena the site of the ariana</text>
  <text start="1068.25" dur="6.299">grande concert bombing on May 22nd and</text>
  <text start="1071.48" dur="6.01">you start to look at this and you start</text>
  <text start="1074.549" dur="7.291">to say well wait a minute what is going</text>
  <text start="1077.49" dur="8.46">on here I mean having a switch in</text>
  <text start="1081.84" dur="7.61">security to a security firm that was</text>
  <text start="1085.95" dur="7.219">handling the Orlando nightclub shooting</text>
  <text start="1089.45" dur="8.02">having the same management company that</text>
  <text start="1093.169" dur="7.691">managed the Manchester Arena I mean they</text>
  <text start="1097.47" dur="6.36">were in on it before what what&amp;#39;s not to</text>
  <text start="1100.86" dur="6.48">say that they&amp;#39;re not in it right now we</text>
  <text start="1103.83" dur="5.16">also understand that the Cabal that eve</text>
  <text start="1107.34" dur="5.88">state they&amp;#39;re very desperate at this</text>
  <text start="1108.99" dur="6.96">point they need a huge distraction they</text>
  <text start="1113.22" dur="5.79">need something to distract from what is</text>
  <text start="1115.95" dur="3.95">coming to have the news report on all of</text>
  <text start="1119.01" dur="4.89">this</text>
  <text start="1119.9" dur="6.25">while the FISA memo and all this is</text>
  <text start="1123.9" dur="4.86">released or maybe they will hold off</text>
  <text start="1126.15" dur="6.3">because this event will be so big that</text>
  <text start="1128.76" dur="6.03">they won&amp;#39;t release it as of yet and of</text>
  <text start="1132.45" dur="4.74">course what kind of an event will this</text>
  <text start="1134.79" dur="4.16">be we don&amp;#39;t know will it happen we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1137.19" dur="4.74">know either but these are strange</text>
  <text start="1138.95" dur="6.79">occurrences and things that we need to</text>
  <text start="1141.93" dur="6.12">look at because it does line up with</text>
  <text start="1145.74" dur="5.31">what happened in other places and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1148.05" dur="5.79">seen this pattern before this is not</text>
  <text start="1151.05" dur="4.5">that this is not something new this is</text>
  <text start="1153.84" dur="4.2">something very interesting now the</text>
  <text start="1155.55" dur="3.06">question is if we dig a little bit</text>
  <text start="1158.04" dur="2.75">deeper</text>
  <text start="1158.61" dur="6.75">have they been training for a specific</text>
  <text start="1160.79" dur="9.06">event are they preparing for something</text>
  <text start="1165.36" dur="8.16">like a bomb a nuclear detonation a</text>
  <text start="1169.85" dur="6.85">shooting something like that we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1173.52" dur="7.35">know and I&amp;#39;m sure information will come</text>
  <text start="1176.7" dur="6.9">out that they are you know practicing</text>
  <text start="1180.87" dur="6.03">some type of drill for a certain event</text>
  <text start="1183.6" dur="5.7">and normally these drills are very very</text>
  <text start="1186.9" dur="5.72">specific it&amp;#39;s not like oh let&amp;#39;s try a</text>
  <text start="1189.3" dur="6.06">gun drill a bomb drill a nuclear</text>
  <text start="1192.62" dur="5.52">explosion drill you know missiles</text>
  <text start="1195.36" dur="6.6">hitting the stadium usually they are</text>
  <text start="1198.14" dur="6.61">focused in on one specific type of an</text>
  <text start="1201.96" dur="4.53">event when we saw like all the other</text>
  <text start="1204.75" dur="5.1">places with shootings and stuff they</text>
  <text start="1206.49" dur="5.01">practice with a shooter if it&amp;#39;s someone</text>
  <text start="1209.85" dur="4.74">wearing a bomb they practiced with a</text>
  <text start="1211.5" dur="4.59">bomb the same thing here now they might</text>
  <text start="1214.59" dur="3.9">have been doing this months ahead of</text>
  <text start="1216.09" dur="5.94">time which I believe they most likely</text>
  <text start="1218.49" dur="6.9">are but we can see with the security</text>
  <text start="1222.03" dur="5.52">with the management company with the</text>
  <text start="1225.39" dur="4.95">company that engineered the u.s. Bank</text>
  <text start="1227.55" dur="5.94">Stadium that&amp;#39;s in disaster relief we see</text>
  <text start="1230.34" dur="7.02">that all of this you know makes our</text>

  <text start="1237.36" dur="4.92">all of this happening at the same time</text>
  <text start="1240.06" dur="4.85">and why are all why are all these</text>
  <text start="1242.28" dur="6.45">different companies linked with other</text>
