  <text start="128.959" dur="7.041">including Boris Johnson out in the UK</text>
  <text start="133.63" dur="5.44">think about what has been happening here</text>
  <text start="136" dur="5.019">they had Theresa May that was their</text>
  <text start="139.07" dur="4.199">person she was going to make this</text>
  <text start="141.019" dur="5.671">incredible deal for the EU not for the</text>
  <text start="143.269" dur="4.581">people the Parliament decided no we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="146.69" dur="4.56">not going to go through with this</text>
  <text start="147.85" dur="7.419">so she resigned then Boris Johnson came</text>
  <text start="151.25" dur="6.6">on board and he was not their person he</text>
  <text start="155.269" dur="5.041">goes against the establishment they</text>
  <text start="157.85" dur="5.25">can&amp;#39;t control him not the way they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="160.31" dur="3.6">controlling everyone else and they</text>
  <text start="163.1" dur="2.76">realized</text>
  <text start="163.91" dur="4.43">that they needed a way to stop him now</text>
  <text start="165.86" dur="5.97">remember out in the UK in many countries</text>
  <text start="168.34" dur="5.92">the deep state the swamp is deep and</text>
  <text start="171.83" dur="4.68">wide they control a lot of the</text>
  <text start="174.26" dur="4.65">government a lot of the courts people</text>
  <text start="176.51" dur="5.43">are blackmailed yes it is the same in</text>
  <text start="178.91" dur="7.02">the UK same in the u.s. same in France</text>
  <text start="181.94" dur="7.5">same in many many countries this whole</text>
  <text start="185.93" dur="7.46">system was set up that way and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="189.44" dur="9.84">really not surprised that the top court</text>
  <text start="193.39" dur="9.94">ruled that Bors Johnson well the</text>
  <text start="199.28" dur="7.02">suspension was illegal he wasn&amp;#39;t allowed</text>
  <text start="203.33" dur="5.61">to suspend Parliament why because he</text>
  <text start="206.3" dur="4.53">lied to the Queen now of course this is</text>
  <text start="208.94" dur="4.44">what they&amp;#39;re saying but we need to</text>
  <text start="210.83" dur="4.08">remember that the global is the central</text>
  <text start="213.38" dur="3.33">bank players they have embedded</text>
  <text start="214.91" dur="3.69">themselves in the court system they</text>
  <text start="216.71" dur="5.19">control it all it&amp;#39;s like every other</text>
  <text start="218.6" dur="4.68">country remember how Trump had to change</text>
  <text start="221.9" dur="3.87">the Supreme Court justice</text>
  <text start="223.28" dur="5.16">the federal judge judges across the</text>
  <text start="225.77" dur="5.28">country well Boris Johnson he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="228.44" dur="6.63">have time to do that so what happened</text>
  <text start="231.05" dur="7.41">here in this landmark ruling the top UK</text>
  <text start="235.07" dur="6.33">court says Johnson his suspension of</text>
  <text start="238.46" dur="4.83">Parliament Parliament is illegal now of</text>
  <text start="241.4" dur="3.3">course Johnson is out then he strongly</text>
  <text start="243.29" dur="4.05">disagrees with the decision of the</text>
  <text start="244.7" dur="5.37">Supreme Court and he said of course</text>
  <text start="247.34" dur="5.28">Parliament will come back and he says</text>
  <text start="250.07" dur="5.49">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people that want to</text>
  <text start="252.62" dur="5.489">frustrate the brexit where they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="255.56" dur="5.82">want it to happen or if it does happen</text>
  <text start="258.109" dur="6.361">it has to be on their terms now remember</text>
  <text start="261.38" dur="5.13">those who surround Boris Johnson are not</text>
  <text start="264.47" dur="3.99">actually supporting them either there</text>
  <text start="266.51" dur="4.2">are many individuals that were put into</text>
  <text start="268.46" dur="4.59">place and they really don&amp;#39;t support him</text>
  <text start="270.71" dur="5.4">think of Trump how many people had to</text>
  <text start="273.05" dur="5.07">let go through his term so far and how</text>
  <text start="276.11" dur="4.89">many people were placed in those</text>
  <text start="278.12" dur="5.55">positions to go after Trump Boris</text>
  <text start="281" dur="6.21">Johnson it&amp;#39;s experiencing the same thing</text>
  <text start="283.67" dur="7.74">now Nigel Farage is saying listen this</text>
  <text start="287.21" dur="7.05">was a tactical error and who led you to</text>
  <text start="291.41" dur="4.08">do this this was chief adviser Dominic</text>
  <text start="294.26" dur="3.48">Cummings</text>
  <text start="295.49" dur="5.94">and Nigel Raj is saying that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="297.74" dur="5.399">crossed swords in the past and this</text>
  <text start="301.43" dur="3.93">individual should step down over the</text>
  <text start="303.139" dur="5.37">affair which he is widely thought to</text>
  <text start="305.36" dur="6.089">have engineered and he tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="308.509" dur="5.88">following the calling of a Queen&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="311.449" dur="4.4">Speech and prorogation is the worst</text>
  <text start="314.389" dur="6.93">political decision ever</text>
  <text start="315.849" dur="8.981">Dominic Cummings must go now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="321.319" dur="7.651">hearing the same exact thing that we</text>
  <text start="324.83" dur="8.91">hear from those people that want Trump</text>
  <text start="328.97" dur="7.56">gone since this happened the same exact</text>
  <text start="333.74" dur="4.47">people that didn&amp;#39;t want brexit or they</text>
  <text start="336.53" dur="4.199">wanted bragging in their own way which</text>
  <text start="338.21" dur="7.139">wasn&amp;#39;t really a brexit they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="340.729" dur="8.31">exactly what those who are trying to get</text>
  <text start="345.349" dur="6.6">rid of Trump are doing we have Jeremy</text>
  <text start="349.039" dur="8.641">Corbyn and many others saying because of</text>
  <text start="351.949" dur="8.46">this Boris Johnson should resign now of</text>
  <text start="357.68" dur="6.359">course they&amp;#39;re using this to try to</text>
  <text start="360.409" dur="6.091">force Johnson out they don&amp;#39;t want him in</text>
  <text start="364.039" dur="5.731">there they can&amp;#39;t control him Boris</text>
  <text start="366.5" dur="6.449">Johnson is not going to resign just like</text>
  <text start="369.77" dur="6.119">Trump is not going to resign just like</text>
  <text start="372.949" dur="4.951">he&amp;#39;s not going to be impeached just like</text>
  <text start="375.889" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re not gonna get rid of him the</text>
  <text start="377.9" dur="4.109">same thing goes with Boris Johnson but</text>
  <text start="380.419" dur="4.68">when we take a closer look at the UK</text>
  <text start="382.009" dur="6.9">supreme court president lady Hale she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="385.099" dur="7.431">wearing a spider now that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="388.909" dur="7.35">interesting where have we read about</text>
  <text start="392.53" dur="5.919">spiders before well these are all</text>
  <text start="396.259" dur="5.491">throughout Q&amp;#39;s posts he talks about</text>
  <text start="398.449" dur="7.59">spiders and spider webs let&amp;#39;s go back to</text>
  <text start="401.75" dur="7.919">post 350 for a second Q says find the</text>
  <text start="406.039" dur="6.69">spider or spiders and build the web the</text>
  <text start="409.669" dur="7.8">map remember they consider you to be the</text>
  <text start="412.729" dur="8.131">fly specifically the feeder so remember</text>
  <text start="417.469" dur="7.62">there are many individuals within very</text>
  <text start="420.86" dur="6.779">high positions that are working for the</text>
  <text start="425.089" dur="3.511">swamp which means most of them most</text>
  <text start="427.639" dur="5.761">likely are</text>
  <text start="428.6" dur="8.94">blackmailed and we can see that they do</text>
  <text start="433.4" dur="6.75">not want this to go forward they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="437.54" dur="6">trying to stop the brexit dead in his</text>
  <text start="440.15" dur="6.75">tracks but remember Morris Johnson there</text>
  <text start="443.54" dur="4.86">is a loophole there is that little thing</text>
  <text start="446.9" dur="3.57">where he just has to write a letter</text>
  <text start="448.4" dur="5.43">saying that we do not want an extension</text>
  <text start="450.47" dur="4.59">and he goes through with the No Deal</text>
  <text start="453.83" dur="3.27">brexit now of course now since</text>
  <text start="455.06" dur="3.63">parliament is back in session what are</text>
  <text start="457.1" dur="3.36">they gonna try to do they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="458.69" dur="3.93">try to stop it any way they possibly can</text>
  <text start="460.46" dur="4.8">and we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this all plays</text>
  <text start="462.62" dur="4.77">out does it mean it&amp;#39;s completely dead no</text>
  <text start="465.26" dur="4.68">nothing&amp;#39;s ever completely dead it just</text>
  <text start="467.39" dur="6.36">means you need to step back look at the</text>
  <text start="469.94" dur="6.69">plan and adjust and that is exactly what</text>
  <text start="473.75" dur="4.47">he&amp;#39;s going to do now here in the US we</text>
  <text start="476.63" dur="3.72">can see why the mainstream media the</text>
  <text start="478.22" dur="4.95">financial pundits are all saying that if</text>
  <text start="480.35" dur="5.25">Trump cuts rates and starts stimulus is</text>
  <text start="483.17" dur="5">going to be a recession they were trying</text>
  <text start="485.6" dur="5.82">to stop him before he did this why</text>
  <text start="488.17" dur="8.83">because Trump is using the same weapon</text>
  <text start="491.42" dur="9.92">as Obama did back in 2012 right before</text>
  <text start="497" dur="8.1">the election what happened well in 2012</text>
  <text start="501.34" dur="5.59">right before Obama was reelected the Fed</text>
  <text start="505.1" dur="5.58">under former Chairman Ben Bernanke did</text>
  <text start="506.93" dur="5.609">what Trump is doing now in the press</text>
  <text start="510.68" dur="4.91">release that followed the September 12th</text>
  <text start="512.539" dur="5.101">and September 13 2012 Fed policy meeting</text>
  <text start="515.59" dur="4">Bernanke and his crew announced the</text>
  <text start="517.64" dur="5.19">third QE move since the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="519.59" dur="5.64">took hold specifically the feds press</text>
  <text start="522.83" dur="4.26">release said the following the committee</text>
  <text start="525.23" dur="4.1">agreed today to increase policy</text>
  <text start="527.09" dur="5.16">accommodation by purchasing additional</text>
  <text start="529.33" dur="5.89">agency mortgage based securities at the</text>
  <text start="532.25" dur="5.61">pace of 40 billion a month so what does</text>
  <text start="535.22" dur="4.86">that mean the Fed was printing an extra</text>
  <text start="537.86" dur="3.69">forty billion more month and putting</text>
  <text start="540.08" dur="4.38">that money into the economy so that the</text>
  <text start="541.55" dur="4.47">conditions wouldn&amp;#39;t weaken by doing this</text>
  <text start="544.46" dur="5.16">the Fed guarantee that the interest</text>
  <text start="546.02" dur="5.58">rates would stay low when the Fed</text>
  <text start="549.62" dur="4.68">announced that pre-election QE</text>
  <text start="551.6" dur="5.91">blockbuster in 2012 the economy was</text>
  <text start="554.3" dur="6.9">growing at 2% and in the third quarter</text>
  <text start="557.51" dur="5.01">of 2012 the gdp ended up when all the</text>
  <text start="561.2" dur="6.36">revisions were done</text>
  <text start="562.52" dur="8.61">at 3.1 percent annualized growth think</text>
  <text start="567.56" dur="6.899">about this this is why they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="571.13" dur="6.39">the recession hall out in the mainstream</text>
  <text start="574.459" dur="5.911">media because they knew they only had a</text>
  <text start="577.52" dur="6.72">small window they also know that this</text>
  <text start="580.37" dur="7.86">economy is not going to last but they</text>
  <text start="584.24" dur="5.06">knew that if Trump forces the Fed to do</text>
  <text start="588.23" dur="4.71">what he wants</text>
  <text start="589.3" dur="7.45">cut the rates and then start stimulus</text>
  <text start="592.94" dur="7.32">guess what the economy is going to take</text>
  <text start="596.75" dur="6.18">off this was already proven back during</text>
  <text start="600.26" dur="6.06">the time that Obama was being reelected</text>
  <text start="602.93" dur="8.31">and remember the Fed is supposed to be</text>
  <text start="606.32" dur="8.43">politically neutral so why did burn a</text>
  <text start="611.24" dur="7.56">key do this for Obama think about this</text>
  <text start="614.75" dur="7.459">for a second but we know the Fed they</text>
  <text start="618.8" dur="8.67">have their own agenda and now it seems</text>
  <text start="622.209" dur="9.19">their agenda is Trump&amp;#39;s agenda now Trump</text>
  <text start="627.47" dur="6.69">at the UN just announced that the future</text>
  <text start="631.399" dur="6.961">does not belong to the globalist any</text>

  <text start="670.76" dur="5.16">past leaders causing them to ignore</text>
  <text start="672.95" dur="5.879">their own national interest but as far</text>
  <text start="675.92" dur="3.96">as America is concerned those days are</text>
  <text start="678.829" dur="5.57">over</text>
  <text start="679.88" dur="7.23">Trump letting all those globalist</text>
