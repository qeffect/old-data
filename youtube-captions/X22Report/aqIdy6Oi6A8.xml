  <text start="75.009" dur="4.11">word debt but what happens if I told you</text>

  <text start="100.899" dur="3.931">actually that is what they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>

  <text start="104.83" dur="3.27">the US government is continually</text>
  <text start="106.45" dur="2.97">borrowing they still haven&amp;#39;t paid off</text>

  <text start="156.25" dur="6.18">actually confirmed the plan where they</text>
  <text start="159.4" dur="4.89">are working together to raise the</text>

  <text start="166" dur="3.239">just a bit but I wanted to talk about</text>
  <text start="167.65" dur="4.02">the cryptocurrency market right now</text>
  <text start="169.239" dur="4.411">because as we know the central banks</text>
  <text start="171.67" dur="3.539">they&amp;#39;ve been hitting the cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="173.65" dur="3.39">market just like the precious metals</text>
  <text start="175.209" dur="5.7">market where they&amp;#39;ve been throwing a lot</text>
  <text start="177.04" dur="6.479">of coins at Bitcoin trying to bring down</text>
  <text start="180.909" dur="4.41">the price which they have been doing to</text>
  <text start="183.519" dur="3.72">make people move</text>
  <text start="185.319" dur="3.93">away from the crypto market to say it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="187.239" dur="3.81">volatile it&amp;#39;s unstable</text>
  <text start="189.249" dur="2.94">you shouldn&amp;#39;t be investing in it you</text>
  <text start="191.049" dur="3.931">shouldn&amp;#39;t be using it</text>
  <text start="192.189" dur="5.28">you shouldn&amp;#39;t even go near it and we can</text>
  <text start="194.98" dur="4.679">see that this was the plan and at the</text>
  <text start="197.469" dur="3.841">time they were doing this while the</text>
  <text start="199.659" dur="4.28">central bank was out there demonizing it</text>
  <text start="201.31" dur="6.509">social media platforms like Google</text>
  <text start="203.939" dur="5.231">Twitter Facebook and the rest they</text>
  <text start="207.819" dur="3.931">decided they were going to ban all</text>
  <text start="209.17" dur="5.249">advertisements about cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="211.75" dur="4.799">we&amp;#39;re not going to have it you can&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="214.419" dur="3.63">can&amp;#39;t sell any anything on it because</text>
  <text start="216.549" dur="4.201">they were trying to protect everyone</text>
  <text start="218.049" dur="5.461">from the crypto market but they still</text>
  <text start="220.75" dur="4.709">allow gambling advertisements that was</text>
  <text start="223.51" dur="3.39">no problem they didn&amp;#39;t feel they needed</text>
  <text start="225.459" dur="3.48">to protect people against gambling</text>
  <text start="226.9" dur="4.44">losing or their money losing their life</text>
  <text start="228.939" dur="3.72">savings and remember with gambling there</text>
  <text start="231.34" dur="4.229">are people that have addiction problems</text>
  <text start="232.659" dur="5.491">with it and they go for counseling but</text>
  <text start="235.569" dur="6.15">that&amp;#39;s ok the crypto market is much much</text>
  <text start="238.15" dur="5.97">more scarier or was this a plan to make</text>
  <text start="241.719" dur="4.74">everyone believe the crypto market was</text>
  <text start="244.12" dur="4.649">scary and that&amp;#39;s exactly what this was</text>
  <text start="246.459" dur="6.081">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="248.769" dur="7.351">that hey you can now put ads on Google</text>
  <text start="252.54" dur="6.819">Facebook Twitter there&amp;#39;s no problem with</text>
  <text start="256.12" dur="6.419">it why is that because what they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="259.359" dur="6.201">is they&amp;#39;ve demonized cryptocurrency to</text>
  <text start="262.539" dur="5.461">the point where they believe the</text>
  <text start="265.56" dur="5.47">population doesn&amp;#39;t believe that</text>
  <text start="268" dur="6.96">cryptocurrency is going to be used as</text>
  <text start="271.03" dur="6.169">anything and of course since that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="274.96" dur="4.5">case it&amp;#39;s no problem to have</text>
  <text start="277.199" dur="3.161">advertisements on there now because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="279.46" dur="3.72">not a big deal</text>
  <text start="280.36" dur="3.839">they believe they accomplished what they</text>
  <text start="283.18" dur="4.709">set out to do</text>
  <text start="284.199" dur="6.361">or did they because once people start to</text>
  <text start="287.889" dur="4.111">realize what this was all about people</text>
  <text start="290.56" dur="3.599">are going to run to precious metals</text>
  <text start="292" dur="5.37">people are gonna run to the crypto</text>
  <text start="294.159" dur="5.341">market and it will happen we see in the</text>
  <text start="297.37" dur="3.93">United States pending home sales they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="299.5" dur="3.81">down by negative two point five percent</text>
  <text start="301.3" dur="5.339">year-on-year this is the biggest drop in</text>
  <text start="303.31" dur="7.919">7 months and the decline was across all</text>
  <text start="306.639" dur="8.191">four regions we see the new numbers for</text>
  <text start="311.229" dur="5.31">the second quarter GDP came out and the</text>
  <text start="314.83" dur="3.51">estimates are around four point two</text>
  <text start="316.539" dur="2.391">percent this is the strongest in four</text>
  <text start="318.34" dur="2.21">years</text>
  <text start="318.93" dur="3.75">and of course as we know this is</text>
  <text start="320.55" dur="3.899">completely manipulated to make it look</text>
  <text start="322.68" dur="3.48">like the economy is doing much much</text>
  <text start="324.449" dur="4.681">better than it really is but we</text>
  <text start="326.16" dur="4.8">understand the economy again if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="329.13" dur="3.93">looking at the statistical numbers yes</text>
  <text start="330.96" dur="4.769">the illusion looks great if we go back</text>
  <text start="333.06" dur="5.25">to 2008 the illusion was the subprime</text>
  <text start="335.729" dur="4.141">securities were triple-a rated everyone</text>
  <text start="338.31" dur="4.02">believed it no one ever thought there</text>
  <text start="339.87" dur="3.87">was a problem except a few who looked</text>
  <text start="342.33" dur="3.119">into it and said wait a minute</text>
  <text start="343.74" dur="3.269">these people are defaulting these</text>
  <text start="345.449" dur="5.161">subprime securities are not triple-a</text>
  <text start="347.009" dur="6.331">this is a lie but again the general</text>
  <text start="350.61" dur="4.739">public believed the illusion the same</text>
  <text start="353.34" dur="4.47">thing is happening right now it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="355.349" dur="4.44">easy to convince a population by</text>
  <text start="357.81" dur="5.699">throwing out statistical information and</text>
  <text start="359.789" dur="7.761">telling you if GDP is good if the stock</text>
  <text start="363.509" dur="7.021">market is going up unemployment is low</text>
  <text start="367.55" dur="5.02">everything is great and if the the</text>
  <text start="370.53" dur="4.949">housing prices continually move up that</text>
  <text start="372.57" dur="5.67">means the economy is very strong well</text>
  <text start="375.479" dur="5.341">this is not true because they told us</text>
  <text start="378.24" dur="6.51">all this prior to 2008 and what happened</text>
  <text start="380.82" dur="6.779">in 2008 everything fell apart the</text>
  <text start="384.75" dur="5.159">economy went into a recession but they</text>
  <text start="387.599" dur="4.231">try to make us believe back then that</text>
  <text start="389.909" dur="3.391">everything was fantastic actually the</text>
  <text start="391.83" dur="4.89">stock market was hitting all-time highs</text>
  <text start="393.3" dur="5.64">unemployment was very very low GDP</text>
  <text start="396.72" dur="4.68">numbers look pretty darn good housing</text>
  <text start="398.94" dur="4.44">prices were up there and then everything</text>
  <text start="401.4" dur="4.53">started to fall apart and of course</text>
  <text start="403.38" dur="5.009">behind the scenes nobody realizes how</text>
  <text start="405.93" dur="4.89">bad the financial institutions were how</text>
  <text start="408.389" dur="4.471">bad corporations were how much money</text>
  <text start="410.82" dur="3.839">they needed because if they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="412.86" dur="3.6">receive it they were going to go</text>
  <text start="414.659" dur="5.401">bankrupt they would no longer exist</text>
  <text start="416.46" dur="7.62">today and we need to understand that we</text>
  <text start="420.06" dur="7.889">have a major debt problem more and more</text>
  <text start="424.08" dur="5.19">people today are not working and more</text>
  <text start="427.949" dur="3.121">and more people don&amp;#39;t have that high</text>
  <text start="429.27" dur="4.8">paying job they&amp;#39;re working part-time</text>
  <text start="431.07" dur="4.2">jobs wages are decreasing and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="434.07" dur="5.37">very interesting everyone talks about</text>
  <text start="435.27" dur="6.209">the military budget how high it is that</text>
  <text start="439.44" dur="3.78">the Department of Defense spending a lot</text>
  <text start="441.479" dur="5.12">of money and all these worth which they</text>
  <text start="443.22" dur="5.97">are and a lot of it is the deep state</text>
  <text start="446.599" dur="5.891">creating these wars in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="449.19" dur="4.879">and they are very high</text>
  <text start="452.49" dur="6.75">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this in</text>
  <text start="454.069" dur="9.91">about four to five years the interest on</text>
  <text start="459.24" dur="7.549">the debt will be more than the military</text>
  <text start="463.979" dur="5.821">budget but nobody talks about that</text>
  <text start="466.789" dur="6.19">nobody says wait a minute how much are</text>
  <text start="469.8" dur="6.03">we paying an interest on this debt think</text>
  <text start="472.979" dur="7.321">about it it&amp;#39;s going to be more than the</text>
  <text start="475.83" dur="7.709">military budget that&amp;#39;s how bad it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="480.3" dur="6.239">going to be and this is four to five</text>
  <text start="483.539" dur="3.241">years away we are so close to it right</text>
  <text start="486.539" dur="3.63">now</text>
  <text start="486.78" dur="7.83">and nobody benches any of this</text>
  <text start="490.169" dur="7.771">it&amp;#39;s amazing we see right now the plan</text>
  <text start="494.61" dur="6.54">is moving forward now Trump came out and</text>
  <text start="497.94" dur="5.58">he said he was not happy about the</text>
  <text start="501.15" dur="4.859">Federal Reserve&amp;#39;s decision earlier in</text>
  <text start="503.52" dur="5.429">the day to raise the benchmark interest</text>
  <text start="506.009" dur="6.121">rates he had at the increase was a</text>
  <text start="508.949" dur="6.15">result of a strong economy we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="512.13" dur="4.5">great as a country unfortunately they</text>
  <text start="515.099" dur="3.781">just raised the interest rates because</text>
  <text start="516.63" dur="5.339">we are doing so well I&amp;#39;m not happy about</text>
  <text start="518.88" dur="5.19">that Trump said I&amp;#39;d rather pay down the</text>
  <text start="521.969" dur="5.37">debt so he knows the debt is way too</text>
  <text start="524.07" dur="5.1">high or do other things create more jobs</text>
  <text start="527.339" dur="3.681">and he went on to say so I&amp;#39;m worried</text>
  <text start="529.17" dur="6.419">about the fact that they seemed to like</text>
  <text start="531.02" dur="7.75">raising interest rates and what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="535.589" dur="7.201">saying right here is Powell is doing</text>
  <text start="538.77" dur="6.84">exactly what he wants and this is how</text>
  <text start="542.79" dur="5.489">the game is played now the mainstream</text>
  <text start="545.61" dur="4.05">media came out and they asked Powell you</text>
  <text start="548.279" dur="3.691">know what do you think about Trump</text>
  <text start="549.66" dur="4.89">criticizing the Fed and Powell just</text>
  <text start="551.97" dur="6.989">brushed it off like he didn&amp;#39;t even care</text>
  <text start="554.55" dur="6.51">and we see at this time the mainstream</text>
  <text start="558.959" dur="4.231">media the deep state they&amp;#39;re concerned</text>
  <text start="561.06" dur="5.82">about this why are they concerned about</text>
  <text start="563.19" dur="5.88">this because they know what happens when</text>
  <text start="566.88" dur="4.5">you raise the interest rates when we hit</text>
  <text start="569.07" dur="5.63">a certain point they understand that the</text>
  <text start="571.38" dur="7.47">system&amp;#39;s going to come down now remember</text>
  <text start="574.7" dur="7.09">their plan was to crash the economy and</text>
  <text start="578.85" dur="4.83">blame it on Trump they didn&amp;#39;t expect</text>
  <text start="581.79" dur="4.149">Trump and those that are working with</text>
  <text start="583.68" dur="5.889">him to take the magic</text>
  <text start="585.939" dur="5.94">wand and pump the economy up to Heights</text>
  <text start="589.569" dur="4.62">that we&amp;#39;ve never seen before yes it</text>
  <text start="591.879" dur="7.41">might be fake it&amp;#39;s a gigantic illusion</text>
  <text start="594.189" dur="7.44">but it didn&amp;#39;t allow the deep state and</text>
  <text start="599.289" dur="4.41">the mainstream media to point the finger</text>
  <text start="601.629" dur="3.841">at Trump because how do you point the</text>
  <text start="603.699" dur="5.1">finger when the economy is doing really</text>
  <text start="605.47" dur="5.279">well they were going to use the Fed</text>
  <text start="608.799" dur="4.23">which they&amp;#39;ve done in the past to</text>
  <text start="610.749" dur="6.06">continually raise the rates to get what</text>
  <text start="613.029" dur="8.79">they wanted a disastrous economy blame</text>
  <text start="616.809" dur="8.25">it on Trump and say he is at fault well</text>
  <text start="621.819" dur="4.61">the tables have been turned Trump the</text>
  <text start="625.059" dur="4.92">Patriots they have control of the Fen</text>
  <text start="626.429" dur="6.49">they&amp;#39;re telling everyone that the</text>
  <text start="629.979" dur="4.71">economy is doing fantastically and the</text>
  <text start="632.919" dur="4.17">mainstream media the deep state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="634.689" dur="5.25">kind of stuck right now because what do</text>
  <text start="637.089" dur="4.47">you say remember in the past they had</text>
  <text start="639.939" dur="4.2">all this power they can create vents</text>
  <text start="641.559" dur="4.5">they can create bores they can tell</text>
  <text start="644.139" dur="4.56">everyone the reason why this is</text>
  <text start="646.059" dur="5.64">happening is because of this event or</text>
  <text start="648.699" dur="6.36">this war or they could blame it on Trump</text>
  <text start="651.699" dur="5.64">or somebody else the power has been</text>
  <text start="655.059" dur="5.61">taken away from them and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="657.339" dur="6.381">scrambling right now and we know just</text>
  <text start="660.669" dur="5.13">from looking at the interest on the debt</text>
  <text start="663.72" dur="4.629">looking at what&amp;#39;s going on in this</text>
  <text start="665.799" dur="5.46">country looking at how the economy is</text>
  <text start="668.349" dur="4.89">falling apart very very quickly we can</text>
  <text start="671.259" dur="5.461">see that there&amp;#39;s just a certain amount</text>
  <text start="673.239" dur="5.97">of time before it comes down by itself</text>
  <text start="676.72" dur="4.379">and you really don&amp;#39;t need anyone to</text>
  <text start="679.209" dur="4.92">bring it down but it&amp;#39;s better to have a</text>
  <text start="681.099" dur="5.88">controlled collapse than a freefall</text>
  <text start="684.129" dur="5.43">collapse and I think this is what Trump</text>
  <text start="686.979" dur="4.86">Powell and the rest are trying to do</text>
  <text start="689.559" dur="6.36">because they need to move us into this</text>
  <text start="691.839" dur="6.78">transition and to move us into this</text>
  <text start="695.919" dur="6.78">transition you need to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="698.619" dur="7.31">old system and you have to make it clear</text>
  <text start="702.699" dur="8.22">that the old system was destroyed</text>
  <text start="705.929" dur="7.75">because of what the Fed did and once</text>
  <text start="710.919" dur="5.4">this is done there is no coming back and</text>
  <text start="713.679" dur="5.731">once you get rid of the Fed or take it</text>
  <text start="716.319" dur="6.151">over the funding to the</text>
  <text start="719.41" dur="5.07">state completely dries up all these</text>
  <text start="722.47" dur="3.989">covert operations yes they still can do</text>
  <text start="724.48" dur="3.659">it with with drug money and things like</text>
  <text start="726.459" dur="3.841">that but a lot of these funds that are</text>
  <text start="728.139" dur="3.57">coming out of the central banks which</text>
  <text start="730.3" dur="3.06">they&amp;#39;re not accounted for because we</text>
  <text start="731.709" dur="4.05">can&amp;#39;t see the books we don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="733.36" dur="4.649">really going on this is all gonna come</text>
  <text start="735.759" dur="5.43">to an end and when it does come to an</text>
  <text start="738.009" dur="5.401">end it&amp;#39;s completely game over but one</text>
  <text start="741.189" dur="5.7">thing is for sure we&amp;#39;re gonna be going</text>
  <text start="743.41" dur="4.71">through a transition and the transition</text>
  <text start="746.889" dur="3.481">is going to be very difficult for</text>
  <text start="748.12" dur="3.719">certain people it&amp;#39;s not gonna be you</text>
  <text start="750.37" dur="4.199">know snap your fingers were on a new</text>
  <text start="751.839" dur="4.17">system I mean think about the 1970s when</text>
  <text start="754.569" dur="3.39">we came off the gold standard moving on</text>
  <text start="756.009" dur="4.5">to the petro dollar system and if we go</text>
  <text start="757.959" dur="6.451">back in time the debt was very very low</text>
  <text start="760.509" dur="8.01">and we were much more stable at that</text>
  <text start="764.41" dur="6.659">time and we still had certain hiccups I</text>
  <text start="768.519" dur="5.67">mean unemployment was very high interest</text>
  <text start="771.069" dur="7.291">rates went sky-high because it took more</text>
  <text start="774.189" dur="6.51">dollars to pay for an item so we saw a</text>
  <text start="778.36" dur="5.099">huge inflation because we came off the</text>
  <text start="780.699" dur="6.45">checks and balances the Fed was able to</text>
  <text start="783.459" dur="6.74">create more currency the government was</text>
  <text start="787.149" dur="6.271">able to borrow a lot more currency and</text>
  <text start="790.199" dur="6.791">we were moving from the gold standard</text>
  <text start="793.42" dur="5.82">poor partial gold standard on to an oil</text>
  <text start="796.99" dur="4.349">standard where there were no controls</text>
  <text start="799.24" dur="6.18">over the Fed they could do whatever they</text>
  <text start="801.339" dur="6.541">wanted and in 90 in 2008 it even got</text>
  <text start="805.42" dur="5.43">worse but just that little period of</text>
  <text start="807.88" dur="5.1">time it was a reserve country were a</text>
  <text start="810.85" dur="4.26">reserve currency of the world and we</text>
  <text start="812.98" dur="5.279">were moving to a reserve currency of the</text>
  <text start="815.11" dur="5.459">world but on to a different system and</text>
  <text start="818.259" dur="5.52">it was very difficult for many many</text>
  <text start="820.569" dur="7.111">people this time around we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="823.779" dur="6.36">coming off this central bank debt system</text>
  <text start="827.68" dur="4.95">and moving to a completely different</text>
  <text start="830.139" dur="5.731">system and those people who are heavily</text>
  <text start="832.63" dur="5.22">invested in this debt system a lot of</text>
  <text start="835.87" dur="4.38">these people are going to get hurt when</text>
  <text start="837.85" dur="5.339">we move on to the other system yes we</text>
  <text start="840.25" dur="7.35">might see high unemployment yes we might</text>
  <text start="843.189" dur="7.051">see problems in the credit arena yes the</text>
  <text start="847.6" dur="5.97">market most likely will come down but to</text>
  <text start="850.24" dur="5.66">get us off this old system you need to</text>
  <text start="853.57" dur="7.65">Troian and you need to show the people</text>
  <text start="855.9" dur="7.75">why we are doing this and this time</text>
  <text start="861.22" dur="5.19">around is not going to be like the 70s</text>
  <text start="863.65" dur="5.57">because we&amp;#39;re at the end stage now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="866.41" dur="6.12">going to be a lot more difficult because</text>
  <text start="869.22" dur="6.01">we have no manufacturing many people are</text>
  <text start="872.53" dur="4.53">reporting that we have no gold and for</text>
  <text start="875.23" dur="4.32">the United States it&amp;#39;s going to be very</text>
  <text start="877.06" dur="3.72">very difficult this is why Trump and the</text>
