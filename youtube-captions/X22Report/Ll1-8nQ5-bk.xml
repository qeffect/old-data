  <text start="72.98" dur="5.48">news now the central bankers they do</text>
  <text start="75.11" dur="6.87">what they do best and that is put</text>
  <text start="78.46" dur="6.52">countries the population into debt more</text>
  <text start="81.98" dur="5.88">debt where people can&amp;#39;t really pay it</text>
  <text start="84.98" dur="6.27">off and they&amp;#39;re stuck this is what we</text>
  <text start="87.86" dur="4.83">see during the end game of a system and</text>
  <text start="91.25" dur="4.2">this is what we&amp;#39;re in right now we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="92.69" dur="4.83">the end stages of this system and if we</text>
  <text start="95.45" dur="5.01">look at the UK right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="97.52" dur="6">household debt well it is worse than any</text>
  <text start="100.46" dur="5.94">time on record Brits are living beyond</text>
  <text start="103.52" dur="5.099">their means like never before in 2017</text>
  <text start="106.4" dur="5.73">each household spent or invest at about</text>
  <text start="108.619" dur="6.541">900 pounds that&amp;#39;s about 1187 dollars</text>
  <text start="112.13" dur="5.4">more than they received on average so to</text>
  <text start="115.16" dur="4.31">fund the deficit that people have been</text>
  <text start="117.53" dur="4.32">borrowing more and saving less</text>
  <text start="119.47" dur="5.38">encouraged by years of record low</text>
  <text start="121.85" dur="5.549">interest rates now according to owen as</text>
  <text start="124.85" dur="4.439">figures the poorest 10% of the household</text>
  <text start="127.399" dur="3.811">spent two and a half times their</text>
  <text start="129.289" dur="4.53">disposable income on average in the</text>
  <text start="131.21" dur="6">financial year and in 2017 while their</text>

  <text start="137.21" dur="2.4">of their available income during the</text>
  <text start="138.77" dur="3.99">same period</text>
  <text start="139.61" dur="5.37">Owen has figured Wednesday showed real</text>
  <text start="142.76" dur="5.25">disposable income grew at the slowest</text>
  <text start="144.98" dur="4.68">pace in five years in the twelve months</text>
  <text start="148.01" dur="4.559">through March after the brexit</text>
  <text start="149.66" dur="5.82">referendum slammed the pound and drove</text>
  <text start="152.569" dur="6.75">up inflation and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="155.48" dur="7.41">now is that in the UK in Europe in</text>
  <text start="159.319" dur="6.351">Australia in Canada the everyday person</text>
  <text start="162.89" dur="6.09">they are having a very difficult time</text>
  <text start="165.67" dur="6.49">making ends meet and it&amp;#39;s getting harder</text>
  <text start="168.98" dur="5.82">and harder as time goes on we see here</text>
  <text start="172.16" dur="4.08">in the United States the humid consumer</text>
  <text start="174.8" dur="5.93">sentiment well that slumped to a</text>
  <text start="176.24" dur="8.55">six-month low in June even though the</text>
  <text start="180.73" dur="5.64">statistical data the government is out</text>
  <text start="184.79" dur="4.19">there telling us that be</text>
  <text start="186.37" dur="5.82">economy is doing well people are not</text>
  <text start="188.98" dur="5.61">really believing this now remember what</text>
  <text start="192.19" dur="8.189">is happening here is the economy is</text>
  <text start="194.59" dur="8.67">being pushed to the edge here Trump the</text>
  <text start="200.379" dur="4.92">Patriots they&amp;#39;re using the same exact</text>
  <text start="203.26" dur="4.289">system that has been in place nothing</text>
  <text start="205.299" dur="4.381">has changed yes they are manipulating</text>
  <text start="207.549" dur="4.22">the month the numbers even more but</text>
  <text start="209.68" dur="7.05">really nothing has changed at this point</text>
  <text start="211.769" dur="8.881">but more worrisome is that people well</text>
  <text start="216.73" dur="7.02">they are going to maybe postpone a</text>
  <text start="220.65" dur="7.51">purchase of a vehicle we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="223.75" dur="6.87">seeing that the vehicle buying plans</text>
  <text start="228.16" dur="5.1">well that posted a significant decline</text>
  <text start="230.62" dur="3.47">in July falling to the lowest levels in</text>
  <text start="233.26" dur="4.47">five years</text>
  <text start="234.09" dur="6.16">same thing with houses because of rates</text>
  <text start="237.73" dur="4.229">moving up home purchases well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="240.25" dur="3.299">declining that&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="241.959" dur="3.301">because we&amp;#39;ve been looking at the</text>
  <text start="243.549" dur="4.141">housing bubble and what is the housing</text>
  <text start="245.26" dur="5.4">bubble doing well it&amp;#39;s popping it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="247.69" dur="5.37">deflating and we saw this with existing</text>
  <text start="250.66" dur="5.879">homes we see it with new homes and now</text>
  <text start="253.06" dur="5.549">we see it with pending homes so both new</text>
  <text start="256.539" dur="5.491">and existing homes they are declining</text>
  <text start="258.609" dur="8.341">and pending home sales well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="262.03" dur="7.71">declining also they fell about 2.5</text>
  <text start="266.95" dur="5.12">percent year-on-year this is the sixth</text>
  <text start="269.74" dur="5.76">straight month of decline</text>
  <text start="272.07" dur="5.26">now as a reminder economists consider</text>
  <text start="275.5" dur="4.52">pending sales a leading indicator</text>
  <text start="277.33" dur="5.03">because they track contract signings</text>
  <text start="280.02" dur="4.899">purchases of existing homes are</text>
  <text start="282.36" dur="4.54">tabulated when a deal closes typically a</text>
  <text start="284.919" dur="3.75">month or two later now let&amp;#39;s think about</text>
  <text start="286.9" dur="3.66">this for a second existing home sales</text>
  <text start="288.669" dur="3.541">are declining new home sales are</text>
  <text start="290.56" dur="4.95">declining pending home sales declining</text>
  <text start="292.21" dur="6.239">we&amp;#39;re in the hottest period of real</text>
  <text start="295.51" dur="6.21">estate right now where people should be</text>
  <text start="298.449" dur="5.28">purchasing homes because school is going</text>
  <text start="301.72" dur="4.5">to start they want to be the home before</text>
  <text start="303.729" dur="5.25">the children go to school it&amp;#39;s warm</text>
  <text start="306.22" dur="4.47">flowers are blooming everything looks</text>
  <text start="308.979" dur="5.851">great people are fixing up their houses</text>
  <text start="310.69" dur="6.06">but we&amp;#39;re seeing housing decline what is</text>
  <text start="314.83" dur="2.91">happening here why do we see prices</text>
  <text start="316.75" dur="3.06">declining right now</text>
  <text start="317.74" dur="3.54">well remember when interest rates were</text>
  <text start="319.81" dur="4.07">very very low what do we have</text>
  <text start="321.28" dur="4.77">we had an investment houses hedge funds</text>
  <text start="323.88" dur="4.15">they&amp;#39;ve been purchasing a lot of houses</text>
  <text start="326.05" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;ve been keeping them off the market</text>
  <text start="328.03" dur="3.33">when I say a lot of houses they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="329.29" dur="4.65">purchasing thousands upon thousands of</text>
  <text start="331.36" dur="5.1">homes and they kept them off the market</text>
  <text start="333.94" dur="3.69">to drive prices up now that interest</text>
  <text start="336.46" dur="3.69">rates are moving up what do you think</text>
  <text start="337.63" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re not purchasing the</text>
  <text start="340.15" dur="3.66">same amount of homes actually most of</text>
  <text start="342.43" dur="3.3">them are probably trying to sell right</text>
  <text start="343.81" dur="3.51">now because they&amp;#39;re realizing we hit the</text>
  <text start="345.73" dur="3.63">top of the bubble and things are</text>
  <text start="347.32" dur="5.37">starting to deflate right now so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="349.36" dur="6.47">where we are at and the whole system is</text>
  <text start="352.69" dur="5.85">coming down now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="355.83" dur="6.61">that bricks are working on something</text>
  <text start="358.54" dur="6">really big now Odom one in Turkey he</text>
  <text start="362.44" dur="5.4">decided you know something I would like</text>
  <text start="364.54" dur="5.4">to be part of the BRICS so erna one went</text>
  <text start="367.84" dur="5.04">to the BRICS and said listen I wish to</text>
  <text start="369.94" dur="6.15">join the group I like to do this now</text>
  <text start="372.88" dur="4.11">well the BRICS said well you can&amp;#39;t join</text>
  <text start="376.09" dur="5.4">the group right now</text>
  <text start="376.99" dur="6.54">it cannot be fulfilled and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="381.49" dur="4.08">looking to expand the membership they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="383.53" dur="7.32">looking to change things and it looks</text>
  <text start="385.57" dur="8.31">like they&amp;#39;re ready to do this the BRICS</text>
  <text start="390.85" dur="7.23">they&amp;#39;ve set an agenda for global</text>
  <text start="393.88" dur="6.18">development now we understand that this</text>
  <text start="398.08" dur="3.87">economy can&amp;#39;t continue the way it is</text>
  <text start="400.06" dur="4.17">this is a central bank economy this is</text>
  <text start="401.95" dur="4.05">not a people&amp;#39;s economy it was created by</text>
  <text start="404.23" dur="4.35">the central bank said oh we&amp;#39;ve it always</text>
  <text start="406" dur="4.95">fails and they have to restart it some</text>
  <text start="408.58" dur="4.32">way or another usually it&amp;#39;s with an</text>
  <text start="410.95" dur="3.72">event or war or something like that</text>
  <text start="412.9" dur="2.43">where they can tell everyone to look</text>
  <text start="414.67" dur="3.21">over there</text>
  <text start="415.33" dur="5.61">this is why you have to scrimp and save</text>
  <text start="417.88" dur="4.62">this is why you can&amp;#39;t purchase things in</text>
  <text start="420.94" dur="4.41">the store this is why the store shelves</text>
  <text start="422.5" dur="5.22">are empty it&amp;#39;s because of the war but in</text>
  <text start="425.35" dur="4.53">reality it&amp;#39;s because their economic</text>
  <text start="427.72" dur="4.83">system has failed and they use the war</text>
  <text start="429.88" dur="5.73">to explain why all of this is not</text>
  <text start="432.55" dur="6.33">happening they don&amp;#39;t have that right now</text>
  <text start="435.61" dur="5.01">and what&amp;#39;s happening is they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="438.88" dur="3.66">figure out a way around this now what</text>
  <text start="440.62" dur="4.44">the Trump - what what Trump and the</text>
  <text start="442.54" dur="5.07">Patriots are doing they are bringing</text>
  <text start="445.06" dur="5.76">this economy to the edge why because</text>
  <text start="447.61" dur="7.02">they need to destroy</text>
  <text start="450.82" dur="6.57">this central bank economy already Q has</text>
  <text start="454.63" dur="6.33">acknowledged and confirmed that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="457.39" dur="8.55">time for the Fed to be brought down or</text>
  <text start="460.96" dur="6.54">to be taken over why because the system</text>
  <text start="465.94" dur="4.02">needs to change now everything that</text>
  <text start="467.5" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re seeing the bilateral trades the</text>
  <text start="469.96" dur="6">tariffs and everything that we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="471.94" dur="6.75">is not for the central bank economy what</text>
  <text start="475.96" dur="5.94">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a move to</text>
  <text start="478.69" dur="4.74">bring us to a new system now let&amp;#39;s take</text>
  <text start="481.9" dur="4.01">a look at what Trump of the Patriots</text>
  <text start="483.43" dur="6.15">have been doing they&amp;#39;ve been changing</text>
  <text start="485.91" dur="9.25">everything the deep state a central bank</text>
  <text start="489.58" dur="9.06">has been doing we&amp;#39;ve had a globalists</text>
  <text start="495.16" dur="6.86">system it is all being changed right now</text>
  <text start="498.64" dur="5.64">TPP struck down NAFTA being renegotiated</text>
  <text start="502.02" dur="3.76">because you just can&amp;#39;t cancel it because</text>
  <text start="504.28" dur="4.11">you&amp;#39;d have to go through Congress</text>
  <text start="505.78" dur="5.67">Congress have to vote so they did a</text>
  <text start="508.39" dur="5.55">renegotiation we see there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="511.45" dur="5.279">bilateral trades going on right now and</text>
  <text start="513.94" dur="4.289">there&amp;#39;s a reason for it because it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="516.729" dur="3.961">lot easier to be diversified with</text>
  <text start="518.229" dur="5.19">bilateral trades you&amp;#39;re not centralized</text>
  <text start="520.69" dur="5.22">with one organization controlling it</text>
  <text start="523.419" dur="3.931">Trump has been out there saying that we</text>
  <text start="525.91" dur="3.96">would like to get rid of the World Trade</text>
  <text start="527.35" dur="4.65">Organization yes that would be down the</text>
  <text start="529.87" dur="5.28">line but he&amp;#39;s already laying the</text>
  <text start="532" dur="5.01">groundwork for all this q has mentioned</text>
  <text start="535.15" dur="2.91">that it&amp;#39;s time for the central bank to</text>
  <text start="537.01" dur="4.08">be removed</text>
  <text start="538.06" dur="5.79">Trump is all for in audit if the</text>
  <text start="541.09" dur="6">Congress if they can pass some</text>
  <text start="543.85" dur="4.95">legislation Trump would sign it they</text>
  <text start="547.09" dur="4.62">would go after the central banking</text>
  <text start="548.8" dur="7.05">system this is all being done right now</text>
  <text start="551.71" dur="7.95">because this central banking system it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="555.85" dur="5.37">time to change it so we could see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="559.66" dur="4.38">happening in the Middle East think about</text>
  <text start="561.22" dur="4.95">this for a second the deep state the</text>

  <text start="576.07" dur="5.56">Iraq wants the US troops out of Iraq so</text>
  <text start="579.61" dur="4.93">the petrodollar system is</text>
  <text start="581.63" dur="6.03">threat right now because once the US is</text>
  <text start="584.54" dur="5.73">out of all these areas what happens the</text>
  <text start="587.66" dur="5.79">countries are going to decide what</text>
  <text start="590.27" dur="6">currency they&amp;#39;re going to use to trade</text>
  <text start="593.45" dur="5.19">oil in and most likely it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>

  <text start="605.06" dur="5.49">using another currency everything but</text>
  <text start="607.55" dur="4.92">the dollar and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="610.55" dur="4.98">Trump has consistently rejected the</text>
  <text start="612.47" dur="6.96">world policeman role that the US was</text>
  <text start="615.53" dur="6.48">pushing on the world everything is</text>
  <text start="619.43" dur="5.28">changing right now and eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="622.01" dur="5.79">going to happen is the u.s. is going to</text>
  <text start="624.71" dur="5.46">have to join the new system this new</text>

  <text start="636.41" dur="5.21">be the dollar everything is about the</text>
  <text start="639.86" dur="4.91">change and all this is being done on</text>
  <text start="641.62" dur="5.8">purpose all of this is being done</text>
  <text start="644.77" dur="4.66">because they want to push the central</text>
  <text start="647.42" dur="4.74">banking system to the edge they already</text>
  <text start="649.43" dur="5.16">know that this system is at its end</text>
  <text start="652.16" dur="5.16">stage why do you think interest rates</text>
  <text start="654.59" dur="5.88">are dropping dramatically I mean we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="657.32" dur="3.93">never seen them this slow wages are not</text>
  <text start="660.47" dur="3.33">improving</text>
  <text start="661.25" dur="4.62">we don&amp;#39;t have manufacturing here right</text>
  <text start="663.8" dur="4.11">now even though people want to believe</text>
  <text start="665.87" dur="4.74">that manufacturing is coming back yes</text>
  <text start="667.91" dur="4.32">maybe in the future but right now you</text>
  <text start="670.61" dur="4.35">just can&amp;#39;t bring everything all the way</text>
  <text start="672.23" dur="5.61">back when it took years and years upon</text>
  <text start="674.96" dur="4.56">years to move it out of the US because</text>
  <text start="677.84" dur="3.48">remember the globe was the central</text>
  <text start="679.52" dur="3.69">banking plan was to have the system</text>
  <text start="681.32" dur="4.41">restarted someplace else and they were</text>
