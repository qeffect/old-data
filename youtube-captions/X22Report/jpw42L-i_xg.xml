  <text start="83.19" dur="5.13">hi and welcome you&amp;#39;re listening to the</text>
  <text start="86.31" dur="5.46">x22 report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="88.32" dur="6.42">episode 1368 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="91.77" dur="5.25">August 31st 2017 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="94.74" dur="5.73">episode is economic indicators plunge</text>
  <text start="97.02" dur="5.55">and banks move to the blockchain let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="100.47" dur="4.89">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="102.57" dur="4.53">news now the brexit negotiations they</text>
  <text start="105.36" dur="4.98">are ongoing right now and they&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="107.1" dur="7.2">their third round of brexit talks and</text>
  <text start="110.34" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;ve come to a close today and it</text>
  <text start="114.3" dur="3.57">looks like they&amp;#39;re going absolutely</text>
  <text start="115.89" dur="5.28">nowhere I mean they&amp;#39;re insulting each</text>
  <text start="117.87" dur="5.31">other they can&amp;#39;t agree on anything and</text>
  <text start="121.17" dur="2.73">we need to remember something very</text>
  <text start="123.18" dur="4.77">important</text>
  <text start="123.9" dur="6.96">the central bank they don&amp;#39;t want the UK</text>
  <text start="127.95" dur="4.77">to leave they don&amp;#39;t want this brexit to</text>
  <text start="130.86" dur="6.36">happen and they&amp;#39;re going to do whatever</text>
  <text start="132.72" dur="7.59">they possibly can to keep the UK within</text>
  <text start="137.22" dur="5.55">the central banking system and we can</text>
  <text start="140.31" dur="5.18">see right now that they&amp;#39;re just going</text>
  <text start="142.77" dur="6.78">back and forth they are deadlocked and</text>
  <text start="145.49" dur="7.21">nothing has changed at all so right now</text>
  <text start="149.55" dur="5.939">we are stuck where we are and nothing is</text>
  <text start="152.7" dur="5.82">happening because they know the central</text>
  <text start="155.489" dur="6.031">bankers if they see a country leave</text>
  <text start="158.52" dur="5.79">their system and they start to prosper</text>
  <text start="161.52" dur="4.56">and they do much much better and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="164.31" dur="4.29">not really involved with the central</text>
  <text start="166.08" dur="4.68">banking system guess what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="168.6" dur="3.51">happen people are going to look at this</text>
  <text start="170.76" dur="2.67">just like Iceland and say wait a minute</text>
  <text start="172.11" dur="4.68">why do we need the central banking</text>
  <text start="173.43" dur="7.529">system the central banking system that</text>
  <text start="176.79" dur="6.15">destroys countries countries flourish</text>
  <text start="180.959" dur="3.541">without the central banking system</text>
  <text start="182.94" dur="3.21">because the central banking system is</text>
  <text start="184.5" dur="3.9">separate and apart from the countries</text>
  <text start="186.15" dur="4.23">they create the currency at a thin thin</text>
  <text start="188.4" dur="4.589">air and then they loan the currency to</text>
  <text start="190.38" dur="4.98">the country with interest attached and</text>
  <text start="192.989" dur="4.411">this is what&amp;#39;s been happening for a very</text>
  <text start="195.36" dur="4.74">long time throughout Europe here in the</text>
  <text start="197.4" dur="5.18">United States Canada Australia all these</text>
  <text start="200.1" dur="4.83">countries they&amp;#39;re all part of the system</text>
  <text start="202.58" dur="4.39">now here in the United States we can see</text>
  <text start="204.93" dur="4.65">that the economy is completely falling</text>
  <text start="206.97" dur="4.08">apart and we&amp;#39;re looking at each and</text>
  <text start="209.58" dur="3.93">every indicator and each and every</text>
  <text start="211.05" dur="4.38">indicator is continually imploding on</text>
  <text start="213.51" dur="3.24">itself we see that real personal</text>
  <text start="215.43" dur="3.12">spending wealth at this</text>
  <text start="216.75" dur="3.96">when did in July not really surprised</text>
  <text start="218.55" dur="3.39">about that they thought that they were</text>
  <text start="220.71" dur="4.62">going to see a point four percent</text>
  <text start="221.94" dur="5.52">bounced in July however the spending</text>
  <text start="225.33" dur="4.71">grew a lot less it was around 0.2</text>
  <text start="227.46" dur="5.49">percent month on month in July it was</text>
  <text start="230.04" dur="5.04">way below expectations and we can see</text>
  <text start="232.95" dur="3.9">that a lot of people well they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="235.08" dur="3.06">saving money savings rates are down by</text>
  <text start="236.85" dur="4.2">three point five percent this is the</text>
  <text start="238.14" dur="4.95">lowest since December of 2016 and as we</text>
  <text start="241.05" dur="5.4">move forward we&amp;#39;re starting to see that</text>
  <text start="243.09" dur="5.52">people are making less money people are</text>
  <text start="246.45" dur="4.44">spending less money people are saving</text>
  <text start="248.61" dur="3.99">less money that means retail is not</text>
  <text start="250.89" dur="3.69">going to do well actually this holiday</text>
  <text start="252.6" dur="4.56">season is most likely going to be a</text>
  <text start="254.58" dur="4.98">complete and utter disaster talking</text>
  <text start="257.16" dur="3.6">about retail you know how the corporate</text>
  <text start="259.56" dur="4.05">media is out there and they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="260.76" dur="4.65">you how great Amazon is and how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="263.61" dur="5.16">gonna be the leader in retail and</text>
  <text start="265.41" dur="5.16">everyone is going towards Amazon because</text>
  <text start="268.77" dur="5.97">everyone wants to purchase from Amazon</text>
  <text start="270.57" dur="6.96">well this whole story is kind of fake</text>
  <text start="274.74" dur="5.6">and this is coming out of Moody&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="277.53" dur="6.66">Moody&amp;#39;s Investors Service saying that</text>
  <text start="280.34" dur="7.06">Amazon well they&amp;#39;re not dominating the</text>
  <text start="284.19" dur="6.96">retail sector it is actually the weakest</text>
  <text start="287.4" dur="6.15">of the big us players and they went on</text>
  <text start="291.15" dur="4.829">to say that yes the ax company is doing</text>
  <text start="293.55" dur="4.95">well and it&amp;#39;s because of their other</text>
  <text start="295.979" dur="5.071">things their cloud service and other</text>
  <text start="298.5" dur="5.04">things it&amp;#39;s not just retail if you strip</text>
  <text start="301.05" dur="6.24">everything else away guess what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="303.54" dur="7.11">not doing as well and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="307.29" dur="5.91">right now is that Amazon includes their</text>
  <text start="310.65" dur="4.59">cloud business their Amazon Web Services</text>
  <text start="313.2" dur="4.77">and they&amp;#39;re talking about the entire</text>
  <text start="315.24" dur="4.5">growth altogether from all of this but</text>
  <text start="317.97" dur="4.11">we need to remember that online sales</text>
  <text start="319.74" dur="6.179">they account for 8 to 10 percent of the</text>
  <text start="322.08" dur="6.33">overall US retail sales and we can see</text>
  <text start="325.919" dur="4.921">they&amp;#39;re taking on the grocery segment</text>
  <text start="328.41" dur="3.78">but this is much lower percentage it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="330.84" dur="4.56">not going to be that big of a deal</text>
  <text start="332.19" dur="5.6">and the big brick-and-mortar retailers</text>
  <text start="335.4" dur="5.97">like Walmart and all the others well</text>
  <text start="337.79" dur="7.059">they do a lot more retail than Amazon so</text>
  <text start="341.37" dur="6.359">the whole thing is one gigantic myth</text>
  <text start="344.849" dur="5.581">that everyone is flowing towards Amazon</text>
  <text start="347.729" dur="5.161">it&amp;#39;s the Amazon effect no it is</text>
  <text start="350.43" dur="6.51">not because what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="352.89" dur="6.75">retail is a trillion dollar business and</text>
  <text start="356.94" dur="4.86">if the online business is only eight to</text>
  <text start="359.64" dur="5.31">ten percent that&amp;#39;s just a small little</text>
  <text start="361.8" dur="6.06">piece of what has been going on we see</text>
  <text start="364.95" dur="5.55">the Chicago PMI well they were expecting</text>
  <text start="367.86" dur="6.18">this nice bounce after a plunge in July</text>
  <text start="370.5" dur="6.84">and guess what it did not bounce and we</text>
  <text start="374.04" dur="5.04">are in trouble at this point we see that</text>
  <text start="377.34" dur="3.63">the employment indicator slipped for the</text>
  <text start="379.08" dur="4.53">third consecutive month in August and</text>
  <text start="380.97" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re starting to see a lot of economic</text>
  <text start="383.61" dur="4.47">indicators well they&amp;#39;re starting to fall</text>
  <text start="385.47" dur="4.37">apart we see that rents they are</text>
  <text start="388.08" dur="4.11">starting to plunge right now in Chicago</text>
  <text start="389.84" dur="4.84">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="392.19" dur="4.47">of people leaving Chicago but this is</text>
  <text start="394.68" dur="4.56">coming out of jumpers national rent</text>
  <text start="396.66" dur="5.58">report for August saying that Chicago&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="399.24" dur="5.97">rent it is dropped by thirteen point</text>
  <text start="402.24" dur="4.59">seven percent and when you look at two</text>
  <text start="405.21" dur="2.85">bedrooms that has dropped by fifteen</text>
  <text start="406.83" dur="3.24">point seven percent if you look at New</text>
  <text start="408.06" dur="4.35">York City we&amp;#39;re seeing the same exact</text>
  <text start="410.07" dur="4.71">thing one bedrooms have dropped by eight</text>
  <text start="412.41" dur="5.07">point nine percent and two bedrooms have</text>
  <text start="414.78" dur="4.02">dropped around fifteen percent or so and</text>
  <text start="417.48" dur="4.47">then if we look at other cities like</text>
  <text start="418.8" dur="5.22">Oakland we see that this is down by 16</text>
  <text start="421.95" dur="5.97">percent Honolulu&amp;#39;s down by 18 percent</text>
  <text start="424.02" dur="6.15">and rents are dropping right now and we</text>
  <text start="427.92" dur="5.07">can see that the whole housing industry</text>
  <text start="430.17" dur="5.25">the rental markets they&amp;#39;re all starting</text>
  <text start="432.99" dur="2.97">to implode on each other now the housing</text>
  <text start="435.42" dur="3.78">market</text>
  <text start="435.96" dur="5.52">well this hit a triple whammy we know</text>
  <text start="439.2" dur="4.71">existing home sales are down new home</text>
  <text start="441.48" dur="5.55">sales are down and now we are seeing</text>
  <text start="443.91" dur="6.3">that pending home sales they have</text>
  <text start="447.03" dur="6.48">slumped in July dropping 0.8% month on</text>
  <text start="450.21" dur="7.35">month now they were expecting a rise of</text>
  <text start="453.51" dur="7.71">0.3% completely missed it altogether and</text>
  <text start="457.56" dur="6.63">what&amp;#39;s very important about this is that</text>
  <text start="461.22" dur="4.35">during the summer months this is the hot</text>
  <text start="464.19" dur="4.56">season no pun intended</text>
  <text start="465.57" dur="4.62">for real estate and to have new homes</text>
  <text start="468.75" dur="4.68">existing homes</text>
  <text start="470.19" dur="6.51">pending home sales all dropping at the</text>
  <text start="473.43" dur="6.27">same time there is a major problem in</text>
  <text start="476.7" dur="5.52">the economy because we should see real</text>
  <text start="479.7" dur="4.11">estate booming at this time people want</text>
  <text start="482.22" dur="2.129">to get into their homes before a school</text>
  <text start="483.81" dur="3.18">start</text>
  <text start="484.349" dur="5.79">it&amp;#39;s warm everyone can move in in the</text>
  <text start="486.99" dur="4.649">warm weather everyone is kind of happy</text>
  <text start="490.139" dur="4.321">and they want to move into their new</text>
  <text start="491.639" dur="4.53">house now if it&amp;#39;s this bad during the</text>
  <text start="494.46" dur="3.449">summer what do you think is gonna happen</text>
  <text start="496.169" dur="3.21">during the winter months it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="497.909" dur="4.65">implode on itself it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="499.379" dur="6.15">absolutely horrific now we talked a lot</text>
  <text start="502.559" dur="4.32">about cryptocurrency and we understand</text>
  <text start="505.529" dur="3.09">that the central banks they are going to</text>
  <text start="506.879" dur="4.41">be making their move to get into the</text>
  <text start="508.619" dur="5.7">crypto market and we&amp;#39;re already seeing</text>
  <text start="511.289" dur="6.42">some signs of this the world&amp;#39;s biggest</text>
  <text start="514.319" dur="6">banks well they aren&amp;#39;t immune to the</text>
  <text start="517.709" dur="4.71">cryptocurrency euphoria we can see that</text>
  <text start="520.319" dur="4.08">they are jumping on the bandwagon now</text>
  <text start="522.419" dur="4.521">this is very interesting what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="524.399" dur="5.641">going to do they&amp;#39;re gonna handle their</text>
  <text start="526.94" dur="6.04">transactions using the blockchain and we</text>
  <text start="530.04" dur="5.7">can see Swiss bank giant UBS and ten</text>
  <text start="532.98" dur="5.58">others are going to do this by using the</text>
  <text start="535.74" dur="5.19">blockchain technology and banks like</text>
  <text start="538.56" dur="4.649">Barclays and HSBC are the latest to join</text>
  <text start="540.93" dur="4.98">the utilities settlement coin that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="543.209" dur="4.771">USC this is the project this is what</text>
  <text start="545.91" dur="3.659">they&amp;#39;re calling their project and what</text>
  <text start="547.98" dur="4.799">they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="549.569" dur="4.921">basically use the blockchain to send</text>
  <text start="552.779" dur="4.471">funds back and forth now this is the</text>
  <text start="554.49" dur="3.839">beginning stage of them getting into the</text>
  <text start="557.25" dur="3.029">blockchain and of course they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="558.329" dur="4.141">tell the public that they&amp;#39;re part of the</text>
  <text start="560.279" dur="3.481">blockchain you don&amp;#39;t have to be going to</text>
  <text start="562.47" dur="4.049">Bitcoin you don&amp;#39;t have to be going to</text>
  <text start="563.76" dur="4.259">anywhere else just use us and what</text>
  <text start="566.519" dur="4.021">they&amp;#39;re saying is that each settlement</text>
  <text start="568.019" dur="5.731">coin would represent a fiat currency</text>
  <text start="570.54" dur="5.88">like euros or dollars on a 1:1 basis and</text>
  <text start="573.75" dur="4.829">whether and would thus be 100 percent</text>
  <text start="576.42" dur="5.039">backed by collateral at the domestic</text>
  <text start="578.579" dur="4.861">central bank now we can see what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="581.459" dur="3.451">doing here they&amp;#39;re getting into the</text>
  <text start="583.44" dur="4.44">market they&amp;#39;re going to be convincing</text>
  <text start="584.91" dur="4.919">everyone that it is completely safe that</text>
  <text start="587.88" dur="3.09">the banks are controlling it and it</text>
  <text start="589.829" dur="3.63">looks like this is how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="590.97" dur="4.95">maneuvering their way into this system</text>
  <text start="593.459" dur="6.93">and basically what is happening right</text>
  <text start="595.92" dur="6.21">now is as the economy breaks down and</text>
  <text start="600.389" dur="3.151">there are many other countries where</text>
  <text start="602.13" dur="2.97">they&amp;#39;re looking at crypto currencies and</text>
  <text start="603.54" dur="3.419">they&amp;#39;re saying you know we don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="605.1" dur="4.5">be part of the central banking system we</text>
  <text start="606.959" dur="4.711">can actually take our funds and bring it</text>
  <text start="609.6" dur="3.989">into the crypto world and we can</text>
  <text start="611.67" dur="4.32">exchange using the crypto currency</text>
  <text start="613.589" dur="3.99">outside of the system they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="615.99" dur="2.07">this to catch on right now it&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="617.579" dur="2.671">very</text>
  <text start="618.06" dur="3.78">very beginning stages and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="620.25" dur="3.75">want the rest of the public to start to</text>
  <text start="621.84" dur="4.95">catch on saying you know something why</text>
  <text start="624" dur="4.35">am i keeping my money in the banks there</text>
  <text start="626.79" dur="3.03">is no reason to keep my money in the</text>
  <text start="628.35" dur="3.3">banks first of all they&amp;#39;re not paying</text>
  <text start="629.82" dur="3">any interest whatsoever actually a lot</text>
  <text start="631.65" dur="3.06">of the banks are in negative territory</text>
  <text start="632.82" dur="3.54">so I&amp;#39;m actually losing money they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="634.71" dur="3.54">charging me a checking fee they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="636.36" dur="5.13">charging me you know any other type of</text>
  <text start="638.25" dur="5.19">fee so why would I keep my funds in the</text>
  <text start="641.49" dur="4.65">bank and when I go to the bank I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="643.44" dur="4.82">even get my funds out of the bank so we</text>
  <text start="646.14" dur="4.91">can see right now they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="648.26" dur="5.83">maneuver their way into this system</text>
  <text start="651.05" dur="4.51">because they understand eventually</text>
  <text start="654.09" dur="4.89">what&amp;#39;s going to happen as this breaks</text>
  <text start="655.56" dur="7.11">out as the economy falters as the dollar</text>

  <text start="666.33" dur="3.84">gold and silver they&amp;#39;ll be running into</text>
  <text start="667.71" dur="4.32">the crypto currencies or both and they</text>

  <text start="702.66" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;re breaking down the myth of Amazon</text>
  <text start="705" dur="5.37">we see real estate as a triple whammy</text>
  <text start="706.77" dur="5.88">and as we move further into this year it</text>
  <text start="710.37" dur="4.62">is just going to get worse and worse</text>
  <text start="712.65" dur="5.34">it&amp;#39;s not going to improve whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="714.99" dur="5.49">this is why once again you need to be</text>
  <text start="717.99" dur="3.87">ready for what is coming I know a lot of</text>
  <text start="720.48" dur="2.76">people are out there saying well I don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="723.24" dur="5.49">this is what&amp;#39;s going to happen here well</text>
  <text start="725.81" dur="5.98">you can say that people have said that</text>
  <text start="728.73" dur="4.56">back in 2008 a lot of people say that</text>
  <text start="731.79" dur="2.28">you know storms not going to come</text>
  <text start="733.29" dur="2.34">there&amp;#39;s not going to be an earthquake</text>
  <text start="734.07" dur="3.63">there&amp;#39;s not going to be any type of</text>
  <text start="735.63" dur="5.1">natural disaster but when it hits and</text>
  <text start="737.7" dur="4.14">those people who are saying that you</text>
  <text start="740.73" dur="2.58">know it&amp;#39;s not going to happen and</text>
  <text start="741.84" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re not prepared and guess what</text>
  <text start="743.31" dur="5.85">happens they&amp;#39;re running trying to find</text>

  <text start="752.13" dur="3.87">that wasn&amp;#39;t a good investment and you</text>
  <text start="753.72" dur="4.049">had a house or something and you knew</text>
  <text start="756" dur="3.329">that eventually the housing market was</text>
  <text start="757.769" dur="4.021">going to come down and we were at the</text>
  <text start="759.329" dur="4.74">height of the market you might have sold</text>
  <text start="761.79" dur="4.409">at that time instead of being underwater</text>
  <text start="764.069" dur="4.861">in your mortgage or maybe having a short</text>
  <text start="766.199" dur="4.62">sale or for closing on your home this is</text>
  <text start="768.93" dur="3.659">why we&amp;#39;ve been tracking the economy this</text>
  <text start="770.819" dur="4.171">is why we&amp;#39;ve been looking into it to</text>
  <text start="772.589" dur="5.221">give everyone a heads-up of what is</text>
  <text start="774.99" dur="5.55">happening and again the central bankers</text>
  <text start="777.81" dur="5.279">are going to blow the economy up as high</text>
  <text start="780.54" dur="4.739">as they possibly can and then pull the</text>
  <text start="783.089" dur="4.291">carpet from under everyone and</text>
  <text start="785.279" dur="3.42">everyone&amp;#39;s gonna be left and sitting</text>
  <text start="787.38" dur="5.04">here going what just happened here</text>
  <text start="788.699" dur="5.731">that&amp;#39;s how they do this it doesn&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="792.42" dur="3.659">a day it doesn&amp;#39;t take two days to blow</text>
  <text start="794.43" dur="4.529">up the economy it takes quite a while</text>
  <text start="796.079" dur="5.82">because once you have a crash it takes a</text>
  <text start="798.959" dur="5.161">while for the people to trust this</text>
  <text start="801.899" dur="4.351">system again and this is why they need</text>
  <text start="804.12" dur="4.32">six seven eight years to do this and</text>
  <text start="806.25" dur="5.16">this is what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing now here</text>
  <text start="808.44" dur="5.519">we are at the end stages of this and the</text>
  <text start="811.41" dur="3.75">central bankers realize that they can&amp;#39;t</text>
