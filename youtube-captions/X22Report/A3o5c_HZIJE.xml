  <text start="127.94" dur="6.39">knew this day would come</text>
  <text start="130.099" dur="6.691">we knew the central bankers would have</text>
  <text start="134.33" dur="4.22">to push their agenda forward they</text>
  <text start="136.79" dur="6.21">weren&amp;#39;t just gonna sit back and allow</text>
  <text start="138.55" dur="7.48">their entire global system come to an</text>
  <text start="143" dur="3.5">end and this is going to be a fight to</text>
  <text start="146.03" dur="3.72">the end</text>
  <text start="146.5" dur="5.11">we know that Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="149.75" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re going after the central bank</text>
  <text start="151.61" dur="5.849">most likely in league with China and</text>
  <text start="154.79" dur="5.97">Russia and most likely many other</text>
  <text start="157.459" dur="5.881">countries the central bankers were</text>
  <text start="160.76" dur="3.18">planning on an event at this point in</text>
  <text start="163.34" dur="2.58">time because</text>
  <text start="163.94" dur="4.35">new their system wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="165.92" dur="4.41">continue on because it only lasts for a</text>
  <text start="168.29" dur="3.84">certain period of time yes they could</text>
  <text start="170.33" dur="3.66">continually manipulate me what happens</text>
  <text start="172.13" dur="3.18">when you continually manipulate the</text>
  <text start="173.99" dur="3.81">numbers look fantastic</text>
  <text start="175.31" dur="5.22">stock market looks great the</text>
  <text start="177.8" dur="4.47">unemployment rate looks great they can</text>
  <text start="180.53" dur="5.46">control inflation that looks fantastic</text>
  <text start="182.27" dur="7.32">but in reality when people start losing</text>
  <text start="185.99" dur="6.12">jobs when more manufacturers leave the</text>
  <text start="189.59" dur="3.69">country when everything starts to fall</text>
  <text start="192.11" dur="4.29">apart in the background and people</text>
  <text start="193.28" dur="5.37">aren&amp;#39;t spending money guess what the</text>
  <text start="196.4" dur="4.53">manipulation really doesn&amp;#39;t mean that</text>
  <text start="198.65" dur="4.86">much because when people are out of work</text>
  <text start="200.93" dur="4.14">when people aren&amp;#39;t purchasing homes when</text>
  <text start="203.51" dur="3.78">people aren&amp;#39;t taking out student loans</text>
  <text start="205.07" dur="5.37">when people aren&amp;#39;t purchasing cars when</text>
  <text start="207.29" dur="4.8">stores are closing down yeah you can</text>
  <text start="210.44" dur="4.05">tell everyone that everything&amp;#39;s great by</text>
  <text start="212.09" dur="6.63">showing them statistical numbers but in</text>
  <text start="214.49" dur="5.97">reality it&amp;#39;s not and they know this they</text>
  <text start="218.72" dur="4.41">know they only have a certain period of</text>
  <text start="220.46" dur="4.14">time Trump in the Patriots they know</text>
  <text start="223.13" dur="5.46">they only have a certain period of time</text>
  <text start="224.6" dur="5.79">before everyone starts to realize what</text>
  <text start="228.59" dur="4.86">this economy not just the United States</text>
  <text start="230.39" dur="5.97">economy but the economy is really all</text>
  <text start="233.45" dur="5.13">about now remember their entire plan I</text>
  <text start="236.36" dur="5.7">say they&amp;#39;re the central bank&amp;#39;s entire</text>
  <text start="238.58" dur="5.34">plan was to have an event by now at</text>
  <text start="242.06" dur="4.26">least the beginning stages of an event</text>
  <text start="243.92" dur="5.16">so they can explain away why all this is</text>
  <text start="246.32" dur="5.669">happening why we&amp;#39;re seeing inflation why</text>
  <text start="249.08" dur="4.65">you have to sacrifice why you have to</text>
  <text start="251.989" dur="3.72">tighten your belt why you have to do all</text>
  <text start="253.73" dur="4.979">these things why you don&amp;#39;t see the food</text>
  <text start="255.709" dur="6.541">and other supplies on the shelves they</text>
  <text start="258.709" dur="6.841">don&amp;#39;t have that right now and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="262.25" dur="6.66">moving their system to what they always</text>
  <text start="265.55" dur="5.01">wanted a digital system and this is</text>
  <text start="268.91" dur="3.87">going to be a crypto currency system now</text>
  <text start="270.56" dur="4.41">a lot of people think well see told you</text>
  <text start="272.78" dur="4.29">crypto currencies always the central</text>
  <text start="274.97" dur="4.26">bankers well think about it use logical</text>
  <text start="277.07" dur="6">thinking before the proper one central</text>
  <text start="279.23" dur="6.6">bank came into existence in 1913 didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="283.07" dur="5.31">we have paper money the difference is</text>
  <text start="285.83" dur="5.34">that paper money</text>
  <text start="288.38" dur="4.71">the currency at the time was the</text>
  <text start="291.17" dur="5.73">people&amp;#39;s we didn&amp;#39;t loan it to ourselves</text>
  <text start="293.09" dur="5.33">with interest attached it was attached</text>
  <text start="296.9" dur="3.66">to something</text>
  <text start="298.42" dur="5.95">same thing with crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="300.56" dur="7.17">cryptocurrencies are fantastic but not</text>
  <text start="304.37" dur="6.21">in the hands of the central bank they</text>
  <text start="307.73" dur="5.91">want to centralize it which is actually</text>
  <text start="310.58" dur="6.54">the opposite of the entire blockchain</text>
  <text start="313.64" dur="5.19">system they want to control it which is</text>
  <text start="317.12" dur="6">actually the opposite of the blockchain</text>
  <text start="318.83" dur="7.41">system they&amp;#39;re going to create it out of</text>
  <text start="323.12" dur="6.48">thin air like it is done now but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="326.24" dur="6.42">going to attach interest to it it</text>
  <text start="329.6" dur="6">doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s paper digital it</text>
  <text start="332.66" dur="7.44">makes no difference the problem is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="335.6" dur="7.59">the central bank once they gain control</text>
  <text start="340.1" dur="5.34">of it once government&amp;#39;s sign it over to</text>
  <text start="343.19" dur="5.31">them and say you have the legal right to</text>
  <text start="345.44" dur="6.48">create this and you can attach interest</text>
  <text start="348.5" dur="6.75">to it and allow governments to borrow</text>
  <text start="351.92" dur="7.41">this currency no matter if it&amp;#39;s paper no</text>
  <text start="355.25" dur="6.66">matter if it&amp;#39;s digital that&amp;#39;s where the</text>
  <text start="359.33" dur="5.07">problem comes in and we&amp;#39;ll be talking</text>
  <text start="361.91" dur="4.47">about that in just a minute but first</text>
  <text start="364.4" dur="5.79">let&amp;#39;s talk about what is happening here</text>
  <text start="366.38" dur="6.72">in the economy we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="370.19" dur="4.59">everything start to turn around and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="373.1" dur="3.87">gonna turn around quite quickly</text>
  <text start="374.78" dur="4.29">we know the central bank here in the</text>
  <text start="376.97" dur="4.92">United States the Fed they&amp;#39;re raising</text>
  <text start="379.07" dur="5.31">the interest rates quite quickly and as</text>
  <text start="381.89" dur="4.62">they continually raise the rates you</text>
  <text start="384.38" dur="5.01">know every 25 basis points we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="386.51" dur="3.9">to see more and more of the economy</text>
  <text start="389.39" dur="2.82">break down we&amp;#39;re going to see different</text>
  <text start="390.41" dur="3.84">sectors start to break down and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="392.21" dur="3.18">what we&amp;#39;re starting to see we know that</text>
  <text start="394.25" dur="3.06">brick-and-mortar stores they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="395.39" dur="4.02">having a lot of trouble yes certain</text>
  <text start="397.31" dur="3.77">sales are moving to online but it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="399.41" dur="4.26">a one-to-one ratio</text>
  <text start="401.08" dur="5.62">yes combining the brick and mortars and</text>
  <text start="403.67" dur="5.85">the online sales sales are okay now</text>
  <text start="406.7" dur="5.31">remember these are sales where people</text>
  <text start="409.52" dur="4.89">are using their credit cards remember</text>
  <text start="412.01" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;ve changed the FICO scores people</text>
  <text start="414.41" dur="4.86">have been receiving credit cards people</text>
  <text start="417.41" dur="4.2">have been receiving blank credit cards</text>
  <text start="419.27" dur="2.99">with a nice credit limit on it because</text>
  <text start="421.61" dur="2.81">they move</text>
  <text start="422.26" dur="4.23">to a different bracket with their credit</text>
  <text start="424.42" dur="4.32">scores so they feel very comfortable</text>
  <text start="426.49" dur="4.89">going out spending money money they</text>
  <text start="428.74" dur="5.25">don&amp;#39;t have and we&amp;#39;ve seen this in the</text>
  <text start="431.38" dur="4.44">past this is why debt continually rises</text>
  <text start="433.99" dur="3.84">and people&amp;#39;s salaries they&amp;#39;re not moving</text>
  <text start="435.82" dur="5.79">anywhere maybe a little bit here and</text>
  <text start="437.83" dur="5.16">there but not much it&amp;#39;s not keeping up -</text>
  <text start="441.61" dur="4.79">the amount of debt that is being taken</text>
  <text start="442.99" dur="5.76">on now this Black Friday</text>
  <text start="446.4" dur="5.11">brick-and-mortar stores they&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="448.75" dur="5.43">less traffic they are having problems</text>
  <text start="451.51" dur="4.68">people aren&amp;#39;t purchasing yes there are</text>
  <text start="454.18" dur="3.96">sales that went to online online is</text>
  <text start="456.19" dur="4.29">going to continually increase in sales</text>
  <text start="458.14" dur="4.59">because it&amp;#39;s brand-new and the directory</text>
  <text start="460.48" dur="5.52">is always going to be up right now until</text>
  <text start="462.73" dur="5.19">it levels off just like we saw you know</text>
  <text start="466" dur="5.22">the internet everyone coming online but</text>
  <text start="467.92" dur="5.1">at certain point it levels off so this</text>
  <text start="471.22" dur="4.59">is brand-new more and more stores are</text>
  <text start="473.02" dur="3.9">offering online sales people are taking</text>
  <text start="475.81" dur="2.76">an advantage of this because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="476.92" dur="3.45">want to leave their homes has nothing to</text>
  <text start="478.57" dur="4.38">do with bad weather or anything like</text>
  <text start="480.37" dur="3.87">that they just find it easier to click a</text>
  <text start="482.95" dur="5.39">button and wait for it to come to their</text>
  <text start="484.24" dur="6.57">house and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="488.34" dur="6.27">brick-and-mortar stores even with their</text>
  <text start="490.81" dur="6.69">online presence they&amp;#39;re still having</text>
  <text start="494.61" dur="4.63">problems it&amp;#39;s not a one-to-one ratio</text>
  <text start="497.5" dur="3.3">where everyone decided hey you know what</text>
  <text start="499.24" dur="3.24">I&amp;#39;m not going to stop a shop at brick</text>
  <text start="500.8" dur="5.13">and mortars I&amp;#39;m gonna do all my shopping</text>
  <text start="502.48" dur="6.75">online we&amp;#39;re not seeing that just yet</text>
  <text start="505.93" dur="5.67">and we&amp;#39;re gonna see this holiday season</text>
  <text start="509.23" dur="4.89">well the sales might look a lot better</text>
  <text start="511.6" dur="5.879">but you have to remember this is all</text>
  <text start="514.12" dur="5.25">going to be on credit and after that</text>
  <text start="517.479" dur="3.391">well that&amp;#39;s where the problem comes in</text>
  <text start="519.37" dur="4.38">do I think this is going to be an</text>
  <text start="520.87" dur="4.62">incredible holiday season no I think</text>
  <text start="523.75" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s going to be problems I think</text>
  <text start="525.49" dur="4.77">more stores are gonna close I think even</text>
  <text start="528.25" dur="4.59">though stores with online presence</text>
  <text start="530.26" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re gonna close also because they</text>
  <text start="532.84" dur="6">will not be able to keep up with what is</text>
  <text start="535.78" dur="6.09">going on in the real economy and what</text>
  <text start="538.84" dur="6.72">really going on is that people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="541.87" dur="5.79">have the funds they have credit but they</text>
  <text start="545.56" dur="4.95">don&amp;#39;t have the funds to pay off that</text>
  <text start="547.66" dur="5.13">credit and that&amp;#39;s where it starts to</text>
  <text start="550.51" dur="3.75">fall apart this is why we see credit</text>
  <text start="552.79" dur="2.8">continually moving up and up and up and</text>
  <text start="554.26" dur="4.45">up we</text>
  <text start="555.59" dur="5.94">today that GM they&amp;#39;re going to have mass</text>
  <text start="558.71" dur="4.98">layoffs affecting around 14,000 workers</text>

  <text start="576.89" dur="4.95">manufacturers what are they&amp;#39;ve done in</text>
  <text start="579.05" dur="5.15">the past to make it look like they were</text>
  <text start="581.84" dur="5.85">doing well they channels stuffed</text>
  <text start="584.2" dur="6.61">dealerships and they counted those as</text>
  <text start="587.69" dur="4.32">sales as they brought cars on to the</text>
  <text start="590.81" dur="3.06">dealerships even notice that no one</text>

  <text start="628.43" dur="5.22">apart you have to go back to what the</text>
  <text start="631.61" dur="3.39">illusion actually was I mean people are</text>
  <text start="633.65" dur="3">gonna say well to all the tariffs that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="635" dur="4.74">the problem this is nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="636.65" dur="5.76">the tariffs automobile manufacturers</text>
  <text start="639.74" dur="5.4">they were propped up once again with a</text>
  <text start="642.41" dur="5.97">gigantic illusion just like prior to</text>
  <text start="645.14" dur="4.47">2008 and then they had a call come</text>
  <text start="648.38" dur="3.54">crawling on the hands and knees and</text>
  <text start="649.61" dur="4.26">begged for money because they were</text>
  <text start="651.92" dur="2.9">overextended the same thing is happening</text>
  <text start="653.87" dur="4.17">right now</text>
  <text start="654.82" dur="5.71">now the central bankers realize that</text>
  <text start="658.04" dur="4.35">this economy can&amp;#39;t continue on Trump the</text>

  <text start="662.39" dur="3.81">can&amp;#39;t continue on</text>
  <text start="663.64" dur="6.13">remember we&amp;#39;re coming down to the end</text>
  <text start="666.2" dur="5.25">stage of all of this and again whoever</text>
  <text start="669.77" dur="3.21">has the narrative they&amp;#39;re the winners</text>
  <text start="671.45" dur="3.87">now the central bankers they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="672.98" dur="4.53">continue on with their plan Trump of the</text>
  <text start="675.32" dur="4.47">Patriots they&amp;#39;re continuing with their</text>
  <text start="677.51" dur="4.31">plan now I do believe Trump and the</text>
  <text start="679.79" dur="5.19">Patriots they have the edge right now</text>
  <text start="681.82" dur="5.92">because they have powell pushing the</text>
  <text start="684.98" dur="4.5">interest rates up and Trump out there</text>
  <text start="687.74" dur="3.36">blaming the Fed</text>
  <text start="689.48" dur="4.14">for all of this which then in turn</text>
  <text start="691.1" dur="5.13">blames the IMF which then in turn blames</text>
  <text start="693.62" dur="6.3">the biz that which in turn blames the EU</text>
  <text start="696.23" dur="6.12">and so on and so forth so the general</text>
  <text start="699.92" dur="5.099">bankers right now they&amp;#39;re looking for a</text>
  <text start="702.35" dur="4.919">way out of this and they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="705.019" dur="5.671">ready to transition into their new</text>
  <text start="707.269" dur="6.271">system now the IMF they have recommended</text>
  <text start="710.69" dur="5.19">that all central banks should use their</text>
  <text start="713.54" dur="5.81">own crypto currencies they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="715.88" dur="6.6">everyone turned towards the blockchain</text>
  <text start="719.35" dur="4.96">hmm why would they want to do this well</text>
  <text start="722.48" dur="4.76">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about this for a very</text>
  <text start="724.31" dur="5.7">long time they want a cashless society</text>
  <text start="727.24" dur="3.58">they want an electronic society think</text>
  <text start="730.01" dur="3.509">about what they can do with an</text>
  <text start="730.82" dur="7.129">electronic society that they control</text>
  <text start="733.519" dur="6.151">don&amp;#39;t get confused why do you think</text>
  <text start="737.949" dur="3.611">Bitcoin and all the other</text>
  <text start="739.67" dur="5.659">cryptocurrencies coins have been</text>
  <text start="741.56" dur="8.219">dropping so much because their entire</text>
  <text start="745.329" dur="7.391">agenda was to show everyone that Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="749.779" dur="5.821">and all the other coins they can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="752.72" dur="5.729">maintained they&amp;#39;re volatile and you</text>
  <text start="755.6" dur="6.33">don&amp;#39;t want to you know use those for</text>
  <text start="758.449" dur="6.601">your electronic currency you need a</text>
  <text start="761.93" dur="5.43">central bank to control it and to keep</text>
  <text start="765.05" dur="3.659">it stable that has been their entire</text>
  <text start="767.36" dur="5.52">narrative from the very very beginning</text>
  <text start="768.709" dur="7.5">and what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is</text>
  <text start="772.88" dur="7.8">they&amp;#39;re pushing their agenda to control</text>
  <text start="776.209" dur="6.721">the electronic space and they want it</text>
  <text start="780.68" dur="3.99">right now because they realize their</text>
  <text start="782.93" dur="3.57">systems coming to an end what can they</text>
  <text start="784.67" dur="4.2">do with electronic currency that they</text>
  <text start="786.5" dur="5.699">control that they force governments to</text>
  <text start="788.87" dur="6.6">say hey listen you will use our whatever</text>
  <text start="792.199" dur="5.221">coin it&amp;#39;s called for trade and all the</text>
  <text start="795.47" dur="5.25">people will use this everyone will be</text>
  <text start="797.42" dur="6.479">taxed on this guess what they&amp;#39;ll know</text>
  <text start="800.72" dur="6.33">right off the bat how much you owe in</text>
  <text start="803.899" dur="5.281">taxes they can collect with a snap of a</text>
  <text start="807.05" dur="4.92">finger they can see all your</text>
  <text start="809.18" dur="6.33">transactions they can monitor everything</text>
  <text start="811.97" dur="6.929">that you do because they can take</text>
  <text start="815.51" dur="4.45">control of it they know what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="818.899" dur="4.721">doing</text>
  <text start="819.96" dur="5.61">and they want full control of this</text>
  <text start="823.62" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;re pushing their agenda right now</text>
  <text start="825.57" dur="7.2">to take full control of all of this so</text>
  <text start="829.8" dur="4.68">you can&amp;#39;t hide cash you can&amp;#39;t do any of</text>
  <text start="832.77" dur="5.82">those things because it will be all</text>
  <text start="834.48" dur="6.12">electronic and remember the point of the</text>
  <text start="838.59" dur="4.35">blockchain the point of these crypto</text>
  <text start="840.6" dur="5.72">currencies is to have it decentralized</text>
  <text start="842.94" dur="6.84">and not controlled by a central bank</text>
  <text start="846.32" dur="7.06">that&amp;#39;s the whole purpose of these where</text>
  <text start="849.78" dur="5.46">we become our own banks but remember the</text>
  <text start="853.38" dur="6.14">private one central bank they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="855.24" dur="8.34">that they want full control over the</text>
  <text start="859.52" dur="6.79">currency and I believe they are calling</text>
  <text start="863.58" dur="5.37">for this transitional phase right now to</text>
  <text start="866.31" dur="5.24">get everything on the blockchain why are</text>
  <text start="868.95" dur="6.21">they moving so rapidly why did the IMF</text>
  <text start="871.55" dur="3.88">put the call out there well think about</text>
  <text start="875.16" dur="1.77">it</text>
  <text start="875.43" dur="3.42">if they can get everything on the</text>
  <text start="876.93" dur="4.98">blockchain and everything transitioned</text>
  <text start="878.85" dur="5.1">into this new system and blame Trump and</text>
  <text start="881.91" dur="4.23">the Patriots for the old system dying</text>
  <text start="883.95" dur="5.1">they can say we have this new system</text>
  <text start="886.14" dur="6.57">ready to go and everything can be used</text>
  <text start="889.05" dur="4.95">on it we have it already prepared now</text>
  <text start="892.71" dur="2.94">they&amp;#39;ve been preparing for this for</text>
  <text start="894" dur="3.69">quite a while there have been many</text>
  <text start="895.65" dur="4.8">different banks that have coordinated</text>
  <text start="897.69" dur="5.43">you know and working together to create</text>
  <text start="900.45" dur="5.37">a new cryptocurrency that banks would be</text>
  <text start="903.12" dur="6.06">able to use do we know the exact name of</text>
  <text start="905.82" dur="5.67">it as of yet no we don&amp;#39;t but if they can</text>
  <text start="909.18" dur="4.02">do this this would stop a lot of the</text>
  <text start="911.49" dur="3.48">bank runs this would stop a lot of these</text>
  <text start="913.2" dur="4.08">things from happening and this is why</text>
  <text start="914.97" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re pushing it so hard right now and</text>
  <text start="917.28" dur="4.95">this is not like they decided yesterday</text>
  <text start="919.44" dur="4.28">this has been their agenda there&amp;#39;s plan</text>
  <text start="922.23" dur="3.18">all along</text>
  <text start="923.72" dur="3.67">this is why you see other</text>
  <text start="925.41" dur="3.48">cryptocurrencies dropping like there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="927.39" dur="4.08">no tomorrow why do you think they</text>
  <text start="928.89" dur="5.85">suppress gold and silver anything that</text>
  <text start="931.47" dur="5.91">goes against their currency system or</text>
  <text start="934.74" dur="5">what they want to do they suppress it</text>
  <text start="937.38" dur="5.19">and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="939.74" dur="5.44">now Trump and the Patriots they have</text>
  <text start="942.57" dur="6.63">completely different plans their plan is</text>
  <text start="945.18" dur="6.86">to expose the criminal activity of what</text>
  <text start="949.2" dur="5.09">the central banks have been doing around</text>
  <text start="952.04" dur="4.71">world and once Trump and the Patriots in</text>
  <text start="954.29" dur="4.65">other countries start to do this the</text>
  <text start="956.75" dur="5.49">central bankers are then doomed because</text>
  <text start="958.94" dur="4.649">once that is out there that they are</text>
  <text start="962.24" dur="3.089">criminal doesn&amp;#39;t matter if they have a</text>
  <text start="963.589" dur="3.06">cryptocurrency it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if they</text>
  <text start="965.329" dur="5.911">want us to transition to this because</text>
  <text start="966.649" dur="6.541">it&amp;#39;s a criminal enterprise and once that</text>
  <text start="971.24" dur="4.769">is exposed once that&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="973.19" dur="7.079">transparent to everyone they&amp;#39;ll have no</text>
  <text start="976.009" dur="6.931">place to hide and countries and people</text>
  <text start="980.269" dur="5.25">will be demanding that the central bank</text>
  <text start="982.94" dur="6.06">be removed that they no longer have the</text>
  <text start="985.519" dur="5.76">power to create currency that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="989" dur="5.13">Trump of the Patriots are going for this</text>
  <text start="991.279" dur="5.04">is not just about arrests here arrests</text>
