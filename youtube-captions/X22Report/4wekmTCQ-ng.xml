  <text start="147.92" dur="4.38">economy here and what is happening now</text>
  <text start="150.74" dur="3.9">we just came out of the holiday season</text>
  <text start="152.3" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;re in January right now and the</text>
  <text start="154.64" dur="5.43">holidays the holiday season was brutal</text>
  <text start="156.62" dur="6.78">it was very brutal on US retailers now I</text>
  <text start="160.07" dur="5.249">know it seems like everything was great</text>
  <text start="163.4" dur="5.88">but Macy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="165.319" dur="8.07">Nordstrom Signet and many other stores</text>
  <text start="169.28" dur="7.769">were all reporting that sales slumped</text>
  <text start="173.389" dur="6.451">Macy said that sales fell after Black</text>
  <text start="177.049" dur="5.071">Friday and Cyber Monday until the week</text>
  <text start="179.84" dur="5.06">of Christmas it had a cut at sales</text>
  <text start="182.12" dur="6.509">forecast it had to give discount</text>
  <text start="184.9" dur="7.179">Nordstrom well they confirm this that</text>
  <text start="188.629" dur="6.211">the trend is not going in their favor</text>
  <text start="192.079" dur="5.91">and they had to take their clothing and</text>
  <text start="194.84" dur="5.22">they had to cut the prices on the</text>
  <text start="197.989" dur="6.411">clothing now remember this was</text>
  <text start="200.06" dur="6.929">brick-and-mortar this was online sales</text>
  <text start="204.4" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re telling you that the American</text>
  <text start="206.989" dur="5.31">people they&amp;#39;re no longer out there</text>
  <text start="208.93" dur="5.259">spending the way they used to remember a</text>
  <text start="212.299" dur="4.17">lot of people they took their credit</text>
  <text start="214.189" dur="5.55">cards they used it for the holiday</text>
  <text start="216.469" dur="5.88">season and now the bills are coming due</text>
  <text start="219.739" dur="4.73">and just because you use credit cards</text>
  <text start="222.349" dur="4.17">and the mainstream media has this</text>
  <text start="224.469" dur="4.121">unbelievable way of making you think</text>
  <text start="226.519" dur="4.68">that sales are fantastic when they say</text>
  <text start="228.59" dur="4.56">well MasterCard and Visa they reported</text>
  <text start="231.199" dur="4.081">this is how much people spent no they</text>
  <text start="233.15" dur="5.459">didn&amp;#39;t spend any of this they took out</text>
  <text start="235.28" dur="6.599">loans to purchase the merchandise they</text>
  <text start="238.609" dur="5.25">have to pay this back and what normally</text>
  <text start="241.879" dur="4.56">people do is they pay it over time and</text>
  <text start="243.859" dur="7.141">there&amp;#39;s interest attached so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="246.439" dur="6.33">reporting on credit card spending this</text>
  <text start="251" dur="4.919">is not the money that people actually</text>
  <text start="252.769" dur="7.261">have to spend if we took and stripped</text>
  <text start="255.919" dur="7.611">away all credit cards this economy would</text>
  <text start="260.03" dur="5.819">implode on itself in a matter of seconds</text>
  <text start="263.53" dur="5.74">this is what the central bankers needed</text>
  <text start="265.849" dur="4.891">to do to keep this entire system</text>
  <text start="269.27" dur="2.13">operational because once we came off the</text>
  <text start="270.74" dur="3.51">gold standard</text>
  <text start="271.4" dur="4.92">you noticed going into the 80s because</text>
  <text start="274.25" dur="3.68">the 70s they were trying to figure</text>
  <text start="276.32" dur="5.04">everything out normalize everything</text>
  <text start="277.93" dur="6.789">going into the 80s credit just opened up</text>
  <text start="281.36" dur="5.42">and all of a sudden everyone was able to</text>
  <text start="284.719" dur="5.67">get credit and they can lease or finance</text>
  <text start="286.78" dur="6.669">cars they can take out credit cards and</text>
  <text start="290.389" dur="4.83">this kept on going and it got worse and</text>
  <text start="293.449" dur="4.291">worse and worse until here we are today</text>
  <text start="295.219" dur="5.551">because they need to counteract</text>
  <text start="297.74" dur="5.04">what they have done they&amp;#39;ve taken us off</text>
  <text start="300.77" dur="4.739">the gold standard and they created</text>
  <text start="302.78" dur="4.35">currency devaluating the dollar how do</text>
  <text start="305.509" dur="3.271">you make up for this well yeah a lot of</text>
  <text start="307.13" dur="4.98">people used credit to purchase things</text>
  <text start="308.78" dur="5.94">but over time that has to come to an end</text>
  <text start="312.11" dur="4.86">it can&amp;#39;t go on forever I know a lot of</text>
  <text start="314.72" dur="5.19">people think it can but it really can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="316.97" dur="6.449">if you&amp;#39;re in a home and you&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="319.91" dur="4.979">and you&amp;#39;re spending money and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="323.419" dur="3.361">spending a lot more money than what</text>
  <text start="324.889" dur="2.37">you&amp;#39;re bringing in eventually what</text>
  <text start="326.78" dur="2.669">happens</text>
  <text start="327.259" dur="3.961">it&amp;#39;s called bankruptcy you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="329.449" dur="4.201">continue on because the interest</text>
  <text start="331.22" dur="4.319">payments the principle and everything</text>
  <text start="333.65" dur="4.019">else you can&amp;#39;t make those payments</text>
  <text start="335.539" dur="6.571">because if you&amp;#39;re not getting raises and</text>
  <text start="337.669" dur="7.5">your salary is stuck and fixed there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="342.11" dur="5.929">no place to go it&amp;#39;s the same with the</text>
  <text start="345.169" dur="8.161">government eventually it comes to an end</text>
  <text start="348.039" dur="7.87">eventually something has to give and we</text>
  <text start="353.33" dur="6.869">are at the end of this Central Bank</text>
  <text start="355.909" dur="7.621">cycle the problem is is that the central</text>
  <text start="360.199" dur="6.84">banks have no way out of this it seems</text>
  <text start="363.53" dur="8.25">like it&amp;#39;s a perfect storm because Trump</text>
  <text start="367.039" dur="8.521">the Patriots came into office while all</text>
  <text start="371.78" dur="5.689">this was happening very interesting if</text>
  <text start="375.56" dur="5.82">you really think about it at the end</text>
  <text start="377.469" dur="8.29">cycle of the central bank when they are</text>
  <text start="381.38" dur="7.17">at their weakest I mean let&amp;#39;s go back to</text>
  <text start="385.759" dur="6.69">post 25 75 for a second this was</text>
  <text start="388.55" dur="6.51">December 10 2018 from cue the plan to</text>
  <text start="392.449" dur="4.111">have the Fed raised rates this is in</text>
  <text start="395.06" dur="4.32">brackets and bold steep incline</text>
  <text start="396.56" dur="4.949">beginning March 2019 in an effort to</text>
  <text start="399.38" dur="4.259">kill the economy prior to 2020</text>
  <text start="401.509" dur="7.081">presidential election is known and</text>
  <text start="403.639" dur="6.481">planned for structure change coming so Q</text>
  <text start="408.59" dur="4.74">is telling us that they already knew</text>
  <text start="410.12" dur="4.94">this plan they do that the deep state</text>
  <text start="413.33" dur="4.589">the central bank</text>
  <text start="415.06" dur="6.789">way before anything they were going to</text>
  <text start="417.919" dur="6.99">use this to show that Trump destroyed</text>
  <text start="421.849" dur="5.37">the economy and he should not be</text>
  <text start="424.909" dur="3.69">reelected now remember they didn&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="427.219" dur="3.361">he was going to make it this far they</text>
  <text start="428.599" dur="2.791">thought from all the pressure from the</text>
  <text start="430.58" dur="3.15">mainstream media</text>
  <text start="431.39" dur="4.32">the intelligence organizations from the</text>
  <text start="433.73" dur="3.96">steel dossier from everything they</text>
  <text start="435.71" dur="4.23">thought they would have them out of</text>
  <text start="437.69" dur="3.66">office remember they have multiple plans</text>
  <text start="439.94" dur="5.12">to remove him</text>
  <text start="441.35" dur="6.48">impeachment may be an assassination and</text>
  <text start="445.06" dur="5.23">then their ultimate is destroying the</text>
  <text start="447.83" dur="3.74">economy because they feel that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="450.29" dur="3.42">foolproof I mean except for</text>
  <text start="451.57" dur="3.24">assassination a Pietschmann is never</text>
  <text start="453.71" dur="5.79">going to happen</text>
  <text start="454.81" dur="6.67">but an economic disaster people again</text>
  <text start="459.5" dur="4.62">when you hit them where their money is</text>
  <text start="461.48" dur="4.95">their wallets and you destroy everything</text>
  <text start="464.12" dur="5.7">that they&amp;#39;ve saved up people become</text>
  <text start="466.43" dur="4.89">angry they were hoping to use this but</text>
  <text start="469.82" dur="5.13">they already understand and they know</text>
  <text start="471.32" dur="7.11">this plan they&amp;#39;ve already taken action</text>
  <text start="474.95" dur="4.74">to fight against this who has control</text>
  <text start="478.43" dur="3.51">over the central bank</text>
  <text start="479.69" dur="5.04">well the deep state they do believe they</text>
  <text start="481.94" dur="4.59">have control trump is continually out</text>
  <text start="484.73" dur="5.16">there saying that I have the magic wand</text>
  <text start="486.53" dur="5.01">I have the power to manipulate I have</text>
  <text start="489.89" dur="3.6">the power and it just does this just</text>
  <text start="491.54" dur="4.32">this magic wand just not just doesn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="493.49" dur="4.47">to the stock market it just doesn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="495.86" dur="5.15">to manipulating the statistical numbers</text>
  <text start="497.96" dur="9.42">it encompasses the Federal Reserve also</text>
  <text start="501.01" dur="10.02">so the IMF is out there and they have</text>
  <text start="507.38" dur="8.79">warned that and they&amp;#39;re afraid of</text>
  <text start="511.03" dur="8.44">political rage which will block the</text>
  <text start="516.17" dur="7.44">Federal Reserve&amp;#39;s rescue efforts when</text>
  <text start="519.47" dur="6.57">the next crisis hits now this is coming</text>
  <text start="523.61" dur="5.07">from David Lipton this is the IMF</text>
  <text start="526.04" dur="7.98">second-highest official and what this</text>
  <text start="528.68" dur="7.38">says to me is that they are telegraphing</text>
  <text start="534.02" dur="4.05">that they understand that they&amp;#39;ve lost</text>
  <text start="536.06" dur="5.13">control over the Federal Reserve and</text>
  <text start="538.07" dur="6.12">they&amp;#39;re very worried that if we enter</text>
  <text start="541.19" dur="5.76">this next crisis which they know is</text>
  <text start="544.19" dur="4.83">coming they know full well that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="546.95" dur="3.72">going to be entering into a recession</text>
  <text start="549.02" dur="3.87">depression and their system will fall</text>
  <text start="550.67" dur="6.18">apart they&amp;#39;re worried and afraid that</text>
  <text start="552.89" dur="8.91">the Federal Reserve will not be able to</text>
  <text start="556.85" dur="7.05">bail the other central bankers out he</text>
  <text start="561.8" dur="4.26">said it is unclear</text>
  <text start="563.9" dur="5.81">whether the US Federal Reserve would</text>
  <text start="566.06" dur="8.82">again be able to extend one trillion</text>
  <text start="569.71" dur="10.81">dollars of swap lines to fellow central</text>
  <text start="574.88" dur="7.14">banks why because they know that Trump</text>
  <text start="580.52" dur="6.509">is in control</text>
  <text start="582.02" dur="7.35">remember this entire system was based on</text>
  <text start="587.029" dur="5.25">a gigantic illusion which the central</text>
  <text start="589.37" dur="4.77">bank&amp;#39;s created and of course it was the</text>
  <text start="592.279" dur="4.231">deep state which helped them where they</text>
  <text start="594.14" dur="4.53">manipulated a lot of the data in the</text>
  <text start="596.51" dur="5.79">government which Trump is using against</text>
  <text start="598.67" dur="7.109">them right now they knew and they I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="602.3" dur="9.42">always known that since 2008 they only</text>
  <text start="605.779" dur="9.121">had a short window to move everything</text>
  <text start="611.72" dur="6.9">and cover it up this is what they were</text>
  <text start="614.9" dur="6.84">in the process of doing now they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="618.62" dur="6.659">have that event now the central banks</text>
  <text start="621.74" dur="7.56">are exposed now there are political</text>
  <text start="625.279" dur="6.871">forces that have taken control over the</text>
  <text start="629.3" dur="5.01">Federal Reserve actually if we go back</text>
  <text start="632.15" dur="4.59">in time we know the central bankers</text>
  <text start="634.31" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re worried about their independence</text>
  <text start="636.74" dur="5.45">that government forces might be</text>
  <text start="639.68" dur="4.89">dictating to them what they need to do</text>
  <text start="642.19" dur="3.7">so right now what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="644.57" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re telegraphing them saying listen</text>
  <text start="645.89" dur="4.8">we don&amp;#39;t know if the Federal Reserve is</text>
  <text start="648.11" dur="6.15">going to bail out all the other central</text>
  <text start="650.69" dur="7.26">banks now what happens when the Federal</text>
  <text start="654.26" dur="5.55">Reserve doesn&amp;#39;t bail out the other</text>
  <text start="657.95" dur="4.77">central banks what happened to the other</text>
  <text start="659.81" dur="5.82">central banks well everything implodes</text>
  <text start="662.72" dur="5.55">on itself now maybe the IMF can help out</text>
  <text start="665.63" dur="5.28">maybe the bits can help out but once</text>
  <text start="668.27" dur="4.98">again you can see the control right now</text>
  <text start="670.91" dur="5.09">will they be able to help out no because</text>
  <text start="673.25" dur="7.2">all these different countries they hold</text>
  <text start="676" dur="6.94">the dollar the Federal Reserve is in</text>
  <text start="680.45" dur="4.71">control of all these other central</text>
  <text start="682.94" dur="4.86">bank&amp;#39;s they propped them up in the past</text>
  <text start="685.16" dur="4.08">and they&amp;#39;re hoping they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="687.8" dur="2.67">able to do this again but I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="689.24" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s going to happen and this is why</text>
  <text start="690.47" dur="5.92">they&amp;#39;re nervous and afraid they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="693.32" dur="6.16">letting everyone know that this</text>
  <text start="696.39" dur="5.93">is going to go south really really fast</text>
  <text start="699.48" dur="6.72">and I believe this is part of the plan</text>
  <text start="702.32" dur="6.94">to expose the central banks for what</text>
  <text start="706.2" dur="6.99">they are the only way to get people to</text>
  <text start="709.26" dur="6.3">understand how evil the central banks</text>
  <text start="713.19" dur="5.55">are is to show them what they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="715.56" dur="5.01">about and the only way to do this is to</text>
  <text start="718.74" dur="6.57">point the finger at them</text>
  <text start="720.57" dur="9.15">now as we approach 2020 I do believe</text>
  <text start="725.31" dur="8.34">that Q Trump the Patriots they are going</text>
  <text start="729.72" dur="5.49">to put off this recession now when I say</text>
  <text start="733.65" dur="2.79">put off the recession I mean oh no</text>
  <text start="735.21" dur="2.85">there&amp;#39;s me no recessions everything&amp;#39;s me</text>
  <text start="736.44" dur="3.45">great no I think what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="738.06" dur="4.5">is these statistical numbers like the</text>
  <text start="739.89" dur="6.21">stock market the unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="742.56" dur="6.33">the GDP numbers they&amp;#39;re gonna use that</text>
  <text start="746.1" dur="5.19">to make it seem like everything is still</text>
  <text start="748.89" dur="5.4">good and what&amp;#39;s going to happen is the</text>
  <text start="751.29" dur="6.48">deep state is going to play their last</text>
  <text start="754.29" dur="5.64">card in their hand and it will be</text>
  <text start="757.77" dur="5.07">nothing and I think what&amp;#39;s gonna happen</text>
  <text start="759.93" dur="4.56">is as we move into the next term of</text>
  <text start="762.84" dur="4.47">Trump which I do believe he&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="764.49" dur="5.6">elected once again I think that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="767.31" dur="6.89">the transition will actually take place</text>
  <text start="770.09" dur="6.97">that&amp;#39;s when he&amp;#39;ll have full control over</text>
  <text start="774.2" dur="4.27">everything because during this period of</text>
  <text start="777.06" dur="3.9">time and this is where I do believe that</text>
  <text start="778.47" dur="5.7">everything is going to start to break</text>
  <text start="780.96" dur="5.04">down because of everything that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="784.17" dur="3.06">to happen and this is not gonna all</text>
  <text start="786" dur="3.66">happen at once I think there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="787.23" dur="4.02">be many many different stages because we</text>
  <text start="789.66" dur="4.8">have many parts of the plan all</text>
  <text start="791.25" dur="5.61">happening at once and I think once we</text>
  <text start="794.46" dur="3.99">get into this area I think they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="796.86" dur="4.2">try to make it as easy as possible for</text>
  <text start="798.45" dur="5.1">people transitioning into this new</text>
  <text start="801.06" dur="4.38">system what will they what will they</text>
  <text start="803.55" dur="3.57">tell the people well they&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="805.44" dur="3.21">to point the finger at the Fed they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="807.12" dur="3.3">gonna have to audit the Fed they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="808.65" dur="3.45">gonna have to show the people what the</text>
  <text start="810.42" dur="3.66">central bank is all about and I believe</text>
  <text start="812.1" dur="4.44">this is what they&amp;#39;re planning to do and</text>
  <text start="814.08" dur="3.99">at that point I don&amp;#39;t believe the deep</text>
  <text start="816.54" dur="4.92">state the central banks will have any</text>
  <text start="818.07" dur="4.95">power whatsoever I think he he will have</text>
  <text start="821.46" dur="5.16">all the power the Patriots have all the</text>
  <text start="823.02" dur="5.82">power at that time so I do believe the</text>
  <text start="826.62" dur="3.44">plan is moving forward we can see the</text>
  <text start="828.84" dur="3.26">central banks they are</text>
  <text start="830.06" dur="4.62">worried they&amp;#39;re afraid they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="832.1" dur="3.57">nervous because they understand what is</text>
  <text start="834.68" dur="4.59">happening right now</text>
  <text start="835.67" dur="6">think about what Trump has done since he</text>
  <text start="839.27" dur="5.16">came into office removed all these</text>
  <text start="841.67" dur="5.67">globalist trade deals pointed the finger</text>
  <text start="844.43" dur="6.6">at the World Trade Organization made</text>
  <text start="847.34" dur="6.78">everyone question these trade deals set</text>
  <text start="851.03" dur="5.73">up bilateral trade deals contradicted</text>
  <text start="854.12" dur="4.74">the Fed I mean think about what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="856.76" dur="4.44">been doing here placed tariffs on China</text>
  <text start="858.86" dur="4.26">making new trade deals which China was</text>
  <text start="861.2" dur="4.41">remember I do believe they were moving a</text>
  <text start="863.12" dur="3.96">lot of the stuff over to China because</text>
  <text start="865.61" dur="3.75">they were the manufacturing powerhouse</text>
  <text start="867.08" dur="5.13">and they were going to use this country</text>
  <text start="869.36" dur="4.32">as their base of operation just like</text>
  <text start="872.21" dur="4.92">they used the United States as their</text>
  <text start="873.68" dur="5.76">base of operation before 1940 they used</text>
  <text start="877.13" dur="3.87">the United Kingdom as their base of</text>
  <text start="879.44" dur="2.64">operation and they just moved from</text>
  <text start="881" dur="2.94">country to country they don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="882.08" dur="3.54">care about country they don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="883.94" dur="4.26">allegiance to people or country or</text>
  <text start="885.62" dur="4.68">anything like that they just use the</text>
  <text start="888.2" dur="3.84">countries up and then eventually move on</text>
  <text start="890.3" dur="3.69">to the next phase because their system</text>
  <text start="892.04" dur="2.82">only lasts for a long you know as long</text>
  <text start="893.99" dur="2.88">as possible</text>
  <text start="894.86" dur="4.23">and then it completely breaks down and</text>
  <text start="896.87" dur="4.65">at that point they have to move to the</text>
  <text start="899.09" dur="4.53">next area and restart the whole thing</text>
  <text start="901.52" dur="5.46">all over again but I think this time</text>
  <text start="903.62" dur="5.94">their plan was cut short this time they</text>
  <text start="906.98" dur="5.37">didn&amp;#39;t expect this they never thought</text>
  <text start="909.56" dur="4.62">she would lose so we are going to be</text>
  <text start="912.35" dur="2.79">going through this transition it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="914.18" dur="2.85">get a lot worse</text>
  <text start="915.14" dur="3.63">on the people&amp;#39;s level not the</text>
  <text start="917.03" dur="3.81">statistical level but on the people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="918.77" dur="4.05">level this will allow Trump to bring</text>
  <text start="920.84" dur="4.86">more manufacturing into the country</text>
  <text start="922.82" dur="6.23">build the country back up create better</text>
  <text start="925.7" dur="7.23">trade deals and this is all being done</text>
  <text start="929.05" dur="7.84">to help the United States transition</text>
  <text start="932.93" dur="5.85">into a system which is outside of the</text>
  <text start="936.89" dur="4.47">central bank system remember during</text>
  <text start="938.78" dur="5.01">Andrew Jackson&amp;#39;s time everything was</text>
  <text start="941.36" dur="5.34">much smaller it wasn&amp;#39;t on a global scale</text>
  <text start="943.79" dur="5.07">this is on a global scale this is much</text>
  <text start="946.7" dur="4.44">much larger than when Andrew Jackson</text>
  <text start="948.86" dur="4.32">took down the central bank so it has to</text>
  <text start="951.14" dur="3.81">be done a little differently moving</text>
  <text start="953.18" dur="2.79">forward here and this is what the plan</text>
  <text start="954.95" dur="2.31">is all about</text>
  <text start="955.97" dur="3.03">listen everyone thinks lot for listening</text>
  <text start="957.26" dur="2.71">be well be safe and especially be</text>
  <text start="959" dur="3.18">prepared</text>
