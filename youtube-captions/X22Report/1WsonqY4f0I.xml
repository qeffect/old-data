  <text start="125.45" dur="4.5">to understand what is going on here they</text>

  <text start="129.95" dur="6.24">need to make sure that you don&amp;#39;t realize</text>
  <text start="132.26" dur="6.78">that this system is dying because as</text>
  <text start="136.19" dur="6.09">we&amp;#39;ve been discussing there will be a</text>
  <text start="139.04" dur="5.52">new system it they just can&amp;#39;t show</text>
  <text start="142.28" dur="4.2">themselves as being the ones who lost</text>
  <text start="144.56" dur="3.84">control the system and they&amp;#39;re the ones</text>
  <text start="146.48" dur="6.24">who destroyed the system because this</text>

  <text start="152.72" dur="10.89">40 to 45 years it&amp;#39;s designed that way</text>
  <text start="156.89" dur="8.88">and they need to stop this old system</text>
  <text start="163.61" dur="4.32">and they need to start a new system now</text>
  <text start="165.77" dur="6.45">there is a transition period which will</text>
  <text start="167.93" dur="8.78">be the collapse of the system and during</text>
  <text start="172.22" dur="8.52">this phase people are going to have</text>
  <text start="176.71" dur="6.49">problems because credits going to freeze</text>
  <text start="180.74" dur="4.29">up we not we might not be able to get</text>
  <text start="183.2" dur="5.58">fuel and if you notice they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="185.03" dur="9.21">pumping a lot of oil and there&amp;#39;s a glut</text>
  <text start="188.78" dur="10.07">of oil think about in the 70s we</text>
  <text start="194.24" dur="4.61">couldn&amp;#39;t get the oil now we have a glut</text>
  <text start="199" dur="3.459">most likely they&amp;#39;re doing this on</text>
  <text start="201.05" dur="6.03">purpose to make sure there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="202.459" dur="7.651">oversupply because once the dollar comes</text>
  <text start="207.08" dur="6.99">off oil and the petro dollar is</text>

  <text start="214.07" dur="4.8">have a problem again and we can see</text>
  <text start="216.739" dur="4.591">they&amp;#39;ve been preparing for this but</text>
  <text start="218.87" dur="4.56">during this time they need everyone to</text>
  <text start="221.33" dur="5.04">think that the economy is doing well</text>
  <text start="223.43" dur="5.25">everything is fine but we know that the</text>
  <text start="226.37" dur="6.149">economy is not doing well and it is not</text>
  <text start="228.68" dur="6.77">fine because we see economic indicators</text>
  <text start="232.519" dur="7.951">all over the place which are completely</text>
  <text start="235.45" dur="7.9">declining deteriorating collapsing Fitch</text>
  <text start="240.47" dur="6.329">released its latest auto so prime report</text>
  <text start="243.35" dur="7.23">and they&amp;#39;re saying that we&amp;#39;ve gone from</text>
  <text start="246.799" dur="6.121">bad to worse warning that the seasonably</text>
  <text start="250.58" dur="5.37">slow summer months are translating into</text>
  <text start="252.92" dur="7.129">an increase in annualized losses and</text>
  <text start="255.95" dur="7.92">delinquencies for us subprime auto loans</text>
  <text start="260.049" dur="8.921">so subprime 60-plus day delinquencies</text>
  <text start="263.87" dur="8.91">rose 13-percent month over month from</text>
  <text start="268.97" dur="6.36">this July which was 4.5 nine percent and</text>
  <text start="272.78" dur="6.36">were seventeen percent higher versus a</text>
  <text start="275.33" dur="6.48">year earlier and this rate was just shy</text>
  <text start="279.14" dur="5.51">of the record peak of five point one six</text>
  <text start="281.81" dur="7.68">percent which was earlier this year</text>
  <text start="284.65" dur="7.42">Fitch also adds that the subprime losses</text>
  <text start="289.49" dur="5.28">hit seven point three nine percent in</text>
  <text start="292.07" dur="5.04">July rising seventeen percent which are</text>
  <text start="294.77" dur="6.57">twenty eight percent higher year</text>
  <text start="297.11" dur="9.06">every year so people are having a rough</text>
  <text start="301.34" dur="7.2">time paying off the autos and we have to</text>
  <text start="306.17" dur="4.53">remember anyone walking into a car</text>
  <text start="308.54" dur="3.78">dealership you have a heartbeat they</text>
  <text start="310.7" dur="4.62">don&amp;#39;t care about credit anymore they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="312.32" dur="8.64">give anyone in automobile to pump up</text>
  <text start="315.32" dur="12.27">this bubble we see durable goods well</text>
  <text start="320.96" dur="10.65">they were revised last June and it</text>
  <text start="327.59" dur="6.87">revised much much lower and then July</text>
  <text start="331.61" dur="6.45">came in and they said look durable goods</text>
  <text start="334.46" dur="5.31">just shot up month on month ahead of</text>
  <text start="338.06" dur="5.04">expectations of three point four percent</text>
  <text start="339.77" dur="6.66">they came in at 4.4% this is the biggest</text>
  <text start="343.1" dur="4.86">gain since October of 2015 well they</text>
  <text start="346.43" dur="4.56">just revised the numbers dramatically</text>
  <text start="347.96" dur="4.41">lower to make it look like I mean June&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="350.99" dur="5.15">numbers dramatically though to make it</text>
  <text start="352.37" dur="8.46">look like July&amp;#39;s numbers are much higher</text>
  <text start="356.14" dur="7.17">but when you really look at this durable</text>
  <text start="360.83" dur="5.55">goods which are like washers dryers</text>
  <text start="363.31" dur="5.14">things like that they fell six point</text>
  <text start="366.38" dur="6.26">four percent year-over-year this is the</text>
  <text start="368.45" dur="7.92">second biggest annual drop in a row</text>
  <text start="372.64" dur="5.74">capital good shipments non-defense X</text>
  <text start="376.37" dur="4.71">aircraft fell by point four percent</text>
  <text start="378.38" dur="6.95">month on month which led to a nine point</text>
  <text start="381.08" dur="7.77">five percent collapse year over a year</text>
  <text start="385.33" dur="6.82">the situation is getting worse and worse</text>
  <text start="388.85" dur="5.01">as we move along here and then we know</text>
  <text start="392.15" dur="3.72">manufacturing is that in the water</text>
  <text start="393.86" dur="3.66">because the US government central</text>
  <text start="395.87" dur="4.68">bankers has told us that we&amp;#39;re no longer</text>
  <text start="397.52" dur="5.94">a manufacturing country we are a service</text>
  <text start="400.55" dur="6.51">country we&amp;#39;re all we do is service and</text>
  <text start="403.46" dur="6.53">purchasing service and purchase well we</text>
  <text start="407.06" dur="6.27">have a problem in the service arena</text>
  <text start="409.99" dur="7.57">services dropped to 50.9 this is the</text>
  <text start="413.33" dur="7.29">lowest since februari of 2016 with the</text>
  <text start="417.56" dur="5.18">lowest jobs data in 20 months new orders</text>
  <text start="420.62" dur="6.54">well they are very weak since May and</text>
  <text start="422.74" dur="6.04">market warns GDB growth is failing to</text>
  <text start="427.16" dur="3.6">accelerate in the third quarter from the</text>
  <text start="428.78" dur="6.24">week one-point-two percent pace</text>
  <text start="430.76" dur="6.69">in the second quarter so I guess the</text>
  <text start="435.02" dur="4.95">service economy will not save the</text>
  <text start="437.45" dur="5.88">economy like the central bankers have</text>
  <text start="439.97" dur="5.31">told us because as we can see the</text>
  <text start="443.33" dur="6.39">situation is getting worse and worse as</text>
  <text start="445.28" dur="7.05">time goes on so we need to look at what</text>
  <text start="449.72" dur="5.48">the central banks have done now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="452.33" dur="5.28">telling us they&amp;#39;re out there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="455.2" dur="4.27">managing the economies for the</text>
  <text start="457.61" dur="4.92">government&amp;#39;s because the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="459.47" dur="6.14">can&amp;#39;t do it on their own and they need</text>
  <text start="462.53" dur="6.24">to be there a private cetera bank</text>
  <text start="465.61" dur="5.08">control by all the private banks they</text>
  <text start="468.77" dur="6.93">need to be in control of the people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="470.69" dur="6.81">money and we can see right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="475.7" dur="7.53">not working for the people it&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="555.88" dur="9.03">they are the economy if you remove the</text>
  <text start="562.55" dur="7.05">central bank right now</text>
  <text start="564.91" dur="8.32">this economy would die it is a it&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="584.18" dur="6.09">majority they&amp;#39;re sitting on the</text>
  <text start="587.21" dur="7.53">sidelines I mean think about it the</text>
  <text start="590.27" dur="9.17">central bank how to step in couldn&amp;#39;t let</text>
  <text start="594.74" dur="8.64">any bank or any large corporation fail</text>
  <text start="599.44" dur="6.19">started to print or push a button and</text>
  <text start="603.38" dur="6.21">create electronic currency like crazy</text>
  <text start="605.63" dur="6.78">and has not stopped they had a buy up</text>
  <text start="609.59" dur="5.4">all the toxic real estate which they</text>
  <text start="612.41" dur="6.12">can&amp;#39;t get rid of and they took it off</text>
  <text start="614.99" dur="7.71">all the banks books they had to tell the</text>
  <text start="618.53" dur="6.6">bank&amp;#39;s not to put the foreclosed houses</text>
  <text start="622.7" dur="4.35">on the market that had to tell and give</text>
  <text start="625.13" dur="5.43">hedge funds and investment companies</text>
  <text start="627.05" dur="5.91">free money to purchase up homes they had</text>
  <text start="630.56" dur="6.6">to bring interest rates down to zero and</text>
  <text start="632.96" dur="6.99">into negative territory they needed to</text>
  <text start="637.16" dur="9.17">do all of this then they had the</text>
  <text start="639.95" dur="11.64">statistics manipulated unemployment GDP</text>
  <text start="646.33" dur="8.91">retail housing you name it they needed</text>
  <text start="651.59" dur="8.04">to manipulate all of it just to convince</text>
  <text start="655.24" dur="11.23">everyone around the world that the</text>
  <text start="659.63" dur="9.36">economy is absolutely fine and if you</text>
  <text start="666.47" dur="7.38">take all that away and you let the free</text>
  <text start="668.99" dur="8.76">market go it would all collapse and the</text>
  <text start="673.85" dur="6.57">question we need to ask is why are they</text>
  <text start="677.75" dur="6.69">doing this it&amp;#39;s not making the everyday</text>
  <text start="680.42" dur="6.3">person wealthy a lot of people are out</text>
  <text start="684.44" dur="5.25">of work a lot of retail stores have</text>
  <text start="686.72" dur="6.89">closed a lot of corporations aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="689.69" dur="8.14">making profits sales are down</text>
  <text start="693.61" dur="8.3">manufacturing is almost gone so</text>
  <text start="697.83" dur="6.47">is benefit it benefits them the central</text>
  <text start="701.91" dur="5.91">bankers the elite the one percent it</text>
  <text start="704.3" dur="7.78">does not benefit the people this is why</text>
  <text start="707.82" dur="8.88">they&amp;#39;ve been doing all of this this is</text>
  <text start="712.08" dur="7.16">why they need this illusion and this is</text>
  <text start="716.7" dur="5.93">why they&amp;#39;re going to continually do it</text>
  <text start="719.24" dur="6.13">until they bring down the economy and</text>
  <text start="722.63" dur="5.89">they&amp;#39;re waiting for the right moment so</text>
  <text start="725.37" dur="5.7">they are not blamed because they know</text>
  <text start="728.52" dur="5.66">that this system it&amp;#39;s at its end game</text>
  <text start="731.07" dur="6.9">and it can&amp;#39;t last much longer and</text>
  <text start="734.18" dur="5.95">they&amp;#39;re racing against time because the</text>
  <text start="737.97" dur="7.38">real economy what&amp;#39;s going on is</text>
  <text start="740.13" dur="6.78">completely separate and apart from their</text>
  <text start="745.35" dur="4.14">illusion and they&amp;#39;re getting further and</text>
  <text start="746.91" dur="7.2">further apart soon it won&amp;#39;t even make</text>
  <text start="749.49" dur="7.95">sense and they know this we see right</text>
  <text start="754.11" dur="6.03">now that all international financial</text>
  <text start="757.44" dur="4.92">transactions must pass through the US</text>
  <text start="760.14" dur="5.75">banking system this is how it was</text>
  <text start="762.36" dur="8.34">designed this gives the US government an</text>
  <text start="765.89" dur="6.67">incredible amount of power and believe</text>
  <text start="770.7" dur="5.94">me they&amp;#39;re not shy in using this power</text>
  <text start="772.56" dur="6.77">they can place sanctions they can take a</text>
  <text start="776.64" dur="6.03">country and destroy it like Venezuela or</text>
  <text start="779.33" dur="9.43">any other country that doesn&amp;#39;t abide by</text>
  <text start="782.67" dur="9.72">their rules and we can see that during</text>
  <text start="788.76" dur="5.07">this period of this power that United</text>
  <text start="792.39" dur="5.28">States government central bankers have</text>
  <text start="793.83" dur="5.39">had they enforce sanctions on many</text>
  <text start="797.67" dur="5.49">countries and make countries do things</text>
  <text start="799.22" dur="8.04">they didn&amp;#39;t really want to do and their</text>
  <text start="803.16" dur="7.5">system right now is being threatened by</text>
  <text start="807.26" dur="6.13">blockchain development and many banks</text>

  <text start="828.819" dur="11.52">we can see that these institutions are</text>
  <text start="834.569" dur="7.12">looking to bypass the US dollar when</text>
