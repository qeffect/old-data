  <text start="93.22" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re going to do whatever they</text>

  <text start="114.369" dur="4.14">waged right in front of us right in</text>
  <text start="116.59" dur="5.58">front of our eyes and they are</text>
  <text start="118.509" dur="4.53">distracting the American person a lot of</text>
  <text start="122.17" dur="3.03">people don&amp;#39;t know they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="123.039" dur="5.551">distracted we have to understand how</text>
  <text start="125.2" dur="5.25">propaganda works now we know that the</text>
  <text start="128.59" dur="4.59">central banks around the world the US</text>
  <text start="130.45" dur="4.67">government most of these central banks</text>
  <text start="133.18" dur="4.98">and governments they&amp;#39;re intertwined and</text>
  <text start="135.12" dur="6.4">we see that they&amp;#39;re continually out</text>
  <text start="138.16" dur="4.95">there working in tandem to make us</text>
  <text start="141.52" dur="5.64">believe that the economies are doing</text>
  <text start="143.11" dur="6.66">well everything is fine and if we keep</text>
  <text start="147.16" dur="4.26">going on like this it will just all work</text>
  <text start="149.77" dur="3.81">out I mean they&amp;#39;ve been saying this</text>
  <text start="151.42" dur="4.56">about Greece for quite a while right now</text>
  <text start="153.58" dur="5.07">and they have been in so much debt</text>
  <text start="155.98" dur="4.979">things have been so bad there they can</text>
  <text start="158.65" dur="5.19">continually implement austerity on the</text>
  <text start="160.959" dur="5.521">people they keep cutting programs they</text>
  <text start="163.84" dur="5.31">keep taking on more debt and the problem</text>
  <text start="166.48" dur="5.49">never really goes away actually it gets</text>
  <text start="169.15" dur="5.25">worse because that&amp;#39;s what central banks</text>
  <text start="171.97" dur="4.77">do now when we look at Greece we see the</text>
  <text start="174.4" dur="4.74">IMF new euro zone well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="176.74" dur="4.89">threatening to walk out on Greece over</text>
  <text start="179.14" dur="4.86">the debt relief because they feel and</text>
  <text start="181.63" dur="4.8">they think that Greece hasn&amp;#39;t done</text>
  <text start="184" dur="2.66">enough we haven&amp;#39;t purchased enough of</text>
  <text start="186.43" dur="1.49">your</text>
  <text start="186.66" dur="4.11">assets you need to put more of your</text>
  <text start="187.92" dur="5.16">assets on sale you have it implemented</text>
  <text start="190.77" dur="4.74">enough austerity on the people you need</text>
  <text start="193.08" dur="3.69">to implement more austerity and the</text>
  <text start="195.51" dur="3.81">Greek government is out there saying</text>
  <text start="196.77" dur="4.2">that we met our obligations we&amp;#39;ve made</text>
  <text start="199.32" dur="6.03">the necessary cuts and the bankers</text>
  <text start="200.97" dur="6.84">always want more and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="205.35" dur="4.41">seeing here in the United States what</text>
  <text start="207.81" dur="5.16">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is this gigantic</text>
  <text start="209.76" dur="6.63">illusion of the economy doing well and</text>
  <text start="212.97" dur="6.27">they keep making stories up of oh we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="216.39" dur="4.77">going to hit escape velocity things are</text>
  <text start="219.24" dur="4.05">going to get better we&amp;#39;re raising the</text>
  <text start="221.16" dur="4.08">rates slowly to help the economy no</text>
  <text start="223.29" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re not they&amp;#39;re doing everything</text>
  <text start="225.24" dur="4.85">they possibly can to destroy the economy</text>
  <text start="228.09" dur="5.22">they don&amp;#39;t want to help it whatsoever</text>
  <text start="230.09" dur="6.82">why do they want to destroy it well at</text>
  <text start="233.31" dur="5.19">this point in time they realize that the</text>
  <text start="236.91" dur="4.29">entire economy is breaking down</text>
  <text start="238.5" dur="5.31">I believe they already hit the trigger</text>
  <text start="241.2" dur="4.98">point as they&amp;#39;re raising the rates and</text>
  <text start="243.81" dur="3.93">I&amp;#39;ll explain that in a little bit but</text>
  <text start="246.18" dur="3.06">what we&amp;#39;re seeing and we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="247.74" dur="4.37">talking about the auto loan market once</text>
  <text start="249.24" dur="6.35">again is that the auto loan market is</text>
  <text start="252.11" dur="7.17">actually doing the same thing as the</text>
  <text start="255.59" dur="6.64">home loan market during the 2008 crisis</text>
  <text start="259.28" dur="7.18">now for months we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="262.23" dur="5.939">the doomed Auto bubble in the US and in</text>
  <text start="266.46" dur="4.5">recent weeks there&amp;#39;s been a growing</text>
  <text start="268.169" dur="5.941">concern that consumers order dealers</text>
  <text start="270.96" dur="5.61">banks have been going beyond simply</text>
  <text start="274.11" dur="5.09">relaxing underwriting standards and have</text>
  <text start="276.57" dur="7.65">been instead been forced to commit yes</text>
  <text start="279.2" dur="8.83">outright fraud in order to attract more</text>
  <text start="284.22" dur="7.65">and more individuals to write these auto</text>
  <text start="288.03" dur="6.69">loans now a UBS strategist Matthew mesh</text>
  <text start="291.87" dur="4.95">says something is definitely going on</text>
  <text start="294.72" dur="5.01">under the hood it&amp;#39;s not just smoke and</text>
  <text start="296.82" dur="5.88">mirrors anymore the evidence is growing</text>
  <text start="299.73" dur="5.28">first the explosion of technology makes</text>
  <text start="302.7" dur="4.89">gaining access to information to improve</text>
  <text start="305.01" dur="4.409">credit scores very simple internet</text>
  <text start="307.59" dur="6.36">searches for credit score are at a</text>
  <text start="309.419" dur="6.841">record level second our survey finds 21%</text>
  <text start="313.95" dur="4.77">of auto loan borrowers admitted to some</text>
  <text start="316.26" dur="4.05">form of inaccuracy in their loan</text>
  <text start="318.72" dur="3.69">application third there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="320.31" dur="4.38">groan concern reported among auto</text>
  <text start="322.41" dur="5.25">lenders around fraud which is the</text>
  <text start="324.69" dur="6.38">extreme case of this behavior more</text>
  <text start="327.66" dur="6.9">concerning is that the trend may be</text>
  <text start="331.07" dur="5.65">systemic as twenty-nine percent of other</text>
  <text start="334.56" dur="5.13">consumer loans student loans credit</text>
  <text start="336.72" dur="5.94">cards acknowledge some form of</text>
  <text start="339.69" dur="5.34">inaccuracy in their applications</text>
  <text start="342.66" dur="4.14">now the fraud rates on auto loan</text>
  <text start="345.03" dur="4.74">applications are currently reaching</text>
  <text start="346.8" dur="6.84">levels seen in the mortgage market back</text>
  <text start="349.77" dur="6.57">in 2009 borrow fraud in the US auto</text>
  <text start="353.64" dur="4.56">loans is surging and yeah they may</text>
  <text start="356.34" dur="4.62">approach levels seen in the mortgages</text>
  <text start="358.2" dur="7.07">during the last decade of the housing</text>
  <text start="360.96" dur="7.08">bubble what are we seeing right now</text>
  <text start="365.27" dur="5.8">they&amp;#39;ve moved what they did in the</text>
  <text start="368.04" dur="5.37">housing market to the auto loan sector</text>
  <text start="371.07" dur="5.63">and they&amp;#39;re doing the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="373.41" dur="5.79">this is this explains why the</text>
  <text start="376.7" dur="5.35">delinquencies are surging right now</text>
  <text start="379.2" dur="6.29">didn&amp;#39;t we see delinquency surging in the</text>
  <text start="382.05" dur="8.58">home loan mortgage market during the</text>
  <text start="385.49" dur="8.92">crisis of 2008 yes we&amp;#39;re seeing the same</text>
  <text start="390.63" dur="5.7">thing happening right now again is the</text>
  <text start="394.41" dur="4.08">older loan market going to cause it no</text>
  <text start="396.33" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s going to be the needle that pops</text>
  <text start="398.49" dur="3.81">the bubble and maybe just one of the</text>
  <text start="400.56" dur="5.43">needles because we see a lot of other</text>
  <text start="402.3" dur="6">things happening now we talked about how</text>
  <text start="405.99" dur="7.2">the set is raising rates and they were</text>
  <text start="408.3" dur="6.57">raising rates back in 2005 2006 2007 and</text>
  <text start="413.19" dur="3.84">they started to lower them because they</text>
  <text start="414.87" dur="5.67">triggered that point where the economy</text>
  <text start="417.03" dur="4.83">started to break apart and we know the</text>
  <text start="420.54" dur="3.63">economy is very weak right now</text>
  <text start="421.86" dur="3.75">we know it has never recovered we know</text>
  <text start="424.17" dur="4.23">from all the facts and everything that</text>
  <text start="425.61" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at retail and how all</text>
  <text start="428.4" dur="3.69">the stores are being closed and how</text>
  <text start="429.93" dur="3.54">people are being laid off we know that</text>
  <text start="432.09" dur="3.36">the economy is not strong at all we know</text>
  <text start="433.47" dur="5.67">the numbers are completely manipulated</text>
  <text start="435.45" dur="8.72">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="439.14" dur="9.6">st. Louis Fed Bullard he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="444.17" dur="7.06">maybe we shouldn&amp;#39;t move the rates up</text>
  <text start="448.74" dur="4.59">anymore because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="451.23" dur="5.07">now is an</text>
  <text start="453.33" dur="8.01">verse reaction to the interest rates as</text>
  <text start="456.3" dur="8.489">we continually increase them hmm now</text>
  <text start="461.34" dur="5.039">this makes you think what he&amp;#39;s saying is</text>
  <text start="464.789" dur="4.051">maybe we should reduce the interest</text>
  <text start="466.379" dur="5.1">rates because we already triggered that</text>
  <text start="468.84" dur="4.02">point where the economy now is just</text>
  <text start="471.479" dur="3.321">coming down and it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if the</text>
  <text start="472.86" dur="5.04">interest rates move up anymore because</text>
  <text start="474.8" dur="6.399">it&amp;#39;s already started so what this means</text>
  <text start="477.9" dur="6.539">is that the economy right now is already</text>
  <text start="481.199" dur="5.131">rolling over and it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if</text>
  <text start="484.439" dur="3.45">they raise the interest rates anymore it</text>
  <text start="486.33" dur="3.329">doesn&amp;#39;t matter what they really do all</text>
  <text start="487.889" dur="3.571">they need to do is keep the stock market</text>
  <text start="489.659" dur="4.29">up and he came out and he made this</text>
  <text start="491.46" dur="5.28">announcement and the stock market shot</text>
  <text start="493.949" dur="4.891">up once again and we can see this is</text>
  <text start="496.74" dur="3.87">what they really want to do now we know</text>
  <text start="498.84" dur="4.049">that this is completely manipulated but</text>
  <text start="500.61" dur="5.459">he wanted to give the news and give it</text>
  <text start="502.889" dur="4.111">out to the public to show that yes this</text>
  <text start="506.069" dur="4.051">is what we&amp;#39;re going to do and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="507" dur="6">hinting about QE once again and of</text>
  <text start="510.12" dur="4.469">course those individuals look at this</text>
  <text start="513" dur="3.62">and say okay this is going to be great</text>
  <text start="514.589" dur="5.64">we&amp;#39;re going to make even more money and</text>
  <text start="516.62" dur="8.01">the market went up now we can see that</text>
  <text start="520.229" dur="7.411">there are others like George Soros who</text>
  <text start="524.63" dur="5.53">understands that this economy is not</text>
  <text start="527.64" dur="6.54">going to last much longer the way it is</text>
  <text start="530.16" dur="6.15">and we know George Soros he has insider</text>
  <text start="534.18" dur="2.88">connections he knows exactly what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="536.31" dur="3.81">going on</text>
  <text start="537.06" dur="5.31">he doesn&amp;#39;t want Trump as president he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="540.12" dur="6.06">been trying everything he possibly can</text>
  <text start="542.37" dur="5.579">to get him out of office and we know</text>
  <text start="546.18" dur="3.69">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen of</text>
  <text start="547.949" dur="3.63">everything that the deep state is doing</text>
  <text start="549.87" dur="3.54">can&amp;#39;t and they can&amp;#39;t get Trump out of</text>
  <text start="551.579" dur="4.801">the office well they have a couple of</text>
  <text start="553.41" dur="6.72">options left collapse the economy before</text>
  <text start="556.38" dur="6.54">he does or assassinate him if everything</text>
  <text start="560.13" dur="4.74">else doesn&amp;#39;t work and George Soros right</text>
  <text start="562.92" dur="6.45">now and this is according to Forbes and</text>
  <text start="564.87" dur="8.82">CNBC he is betting against the US stock</text>
  <text start="569.37" dur="6.779">market and he&amp;#39;s gone big now his two</text>
  <text start="573.69" dur="6.06">plays betting on a major downturn have a</text>
  <text start="576.149" dur="7.981">notional or potential value of 764</text>
  <text start="579.75" dur="7.55">billion dollars the plan is to create a</text>
  <text start="584.13" dur="8.11">financial apocalypse</text>
  <text start="587.3" dur="9.63">to basically bring down Trump and have</text>
  <text start="592.24" dur="7.39">everything in financial ruin and this is</text>
  <text start="596.93" dur="6.24">what the central bankers are looking to</text>
  <text start="599.63" dur="6.63">do they want to keep Trump very busy</text>
  <text start="603.17" dur="4.65">while they bring down the economy and at</text>
  <text start="606.26" dur="4.17">that point he&amp;#39;ll be putting out fires</text>
  <text start="607.82" dur="5.18">left and right because at that point the</text>
  <text start="610.43" dur="6.38">central banks would own the narrative</text>
  <text start="613" dur="6.67">they will explain why it came down and</text>
  <text start="616.81" dur="6.61">how they&amp;#39;re going to improve it where</text>
  <text start="619.67" dur="6.659">they stay in charge while the economy is</text>
  <text start="623.42" dur="4.89">down and reeling well Trump is going to</text>
  <text start="626.329" dur="4.411">be very busy putting out fires and</text>
  <text start="628.31" dur="6.209">they&amp;#39;re going to point the finger at him</text>
  <text start="630.74" dur="5.81">and we can see right now that Soros</text>
  <text start="634.519" dur="5.31">right now he has two primary plays</text>
  <text start="636.55" dur="7.06">against large caps via the sp500 and</text>
  <text start="639.829" dur="7.32">small caps via the Russell 2000 and we</text>
  <text start="643.61" dur="5.88">see right now that he understands what</text>
  <text start="647.149" dur="6.151">is going on here he&amp;#39;s part of the</text>
  <text start="649.49" dur="5.82">insider crowd he&amp;#39;s part of this system</text>
  <text start="653.3" dur="5.25">and I&amp;#39;m talking about the deep state</text>
  <text start="655.31" dur="5.19">system and these plays that he has right</text>
  <text start="658.55" dur="5.64">now are through his family office Soros</text>
  <text start="660.5" dur="7.62">Fund management now we need to</text>
  <text start="664.19" dur="6.93">understand that Trump at this point he</text>
  <text start="668.12" dur="7.05">is working with many other countries to</text>
  <text start="671.12" dur="8.25">devise this plan that will help the</text>
  <text start="675.17" dur="7.409">United States after the collapse not</text>
  <text start="679.37" dur="5.459">during this period right now everything</text>
  <text start="682.579" dur="6.091">that he&amp;#39;s doing right now it will not</text>
  <text start="684.829" dur="5.731">work in this model everything needs to</text>
  <text start="688.67" dur="4.229">be reset everything needs to be washed</text>
  <text start="690.56" dur="4.71">away just like his businesses when they</text>
  <text start="692.899" dur="4.321">are failing there&amp;#39;s too much debt not</text>
  <text start="695.27" dur="3.66">enough revenue coming in you got to get</text>
  <text start="697.22" dur="4.2">rid of the debt you got to get rid of</text>
  <text start="698.93" dur="5.219">the problem the problem is a central</text>
  <text start="701.42" dur="4.2">bank the problem is the deep state and</text>
  <text start="704.149" dur="4.591">the only way to do this is to cut off</text>

  <text start="731.52" dur="4.77">countries hold the dollar because they</text>
  <text start="733.41" dur="5.55">needed to purchase oil and when they go</text>

  <text start="757.86" dur="4.86">see right now this is what he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="759.48" dur="5.28">planning on now there&amp;#39;s many different</text>
  <text start="762.72" dur="5.91">levels and many things that he has to do</text>

  <text start="774.6" dur="7.8">this is his he he&amp;#39;s preparing for the</text>
  <text start="778.86" dur="7.05">collapse and shifting us to this</text>
  <text start="782.4" dur="5.91">entirely new model and this model is not</text>
  <text start="785.91" dur="4.83">going to include the globalists it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="788.31" dur="4.98">going to include the deep state it&amp;#39;s not</text>

  <text start="796.02" dur="4.5">to happen are they going to let it</text>
  <text start="797.49" dur="5.25">happen no this is why we see what is</text>
  <text start="800.52" dur="4.17">going on out there now and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="802.74" dur="3.96">continually pushing their agenda to get</text>
  <text start="804.69" dur="3.98">him out of office they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="806.7" dur="5.37">distraction they&amp;#39;re using propaganda</text>
  <text start="808.67" dur="6.91">because they know that if he succeeds</text>
  <text start="812.07" dur="6.9">they&amp;#39;re done for so it&amp;#39;s a race against</text>
  <text start="815.58" dur="5.31">time now one thing is for sure this</text>
  <text start="818.97" dur="3.09">economy is going to be completely</text>
  <text start="820.89" dur="2.76">different we&amp;#39;re going to go through a</text>
  <text start="822.06" dur="3.57">transition period you can call it a</text>
  <text start="823.65" dur="4.59">collapse transition however you want to</text>
  <text start="825.63" dur="5.76">call it but during this period of time</text>
  <text start="828.24" dur="5.36">it&amp;#39;s going to be a rough period of time</text>
  <text start="831.39" dur="4.17">because things are going to be chaotic</text>
  <text start="833.6" dur="4.15">people are not going to understand what</text>
  <text start="835.56" dur="4.32">is going on and people are not going to</text>
  <text start="837.75" dur="3.75">be prepared for it this is why we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="839.88" dur="3.21">been talking about all of this is why</text>
  <text start="841.5" dur="2.91">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking everything this is</text>
  <text start="843.09" dur="3.9">why we&amp;#39;ve been looking at everything</text>
  <text start="844.41" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s not to scare you it&amp;#39;s not to use</text>
  <text start="846.99" dur="3.96">fear-mongering</text>
  <text start="848.16" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s to prepare you for what is coming</text>
  <text start="850.95" dur="4.23">if I told you there&amp;#39;s a hurricane coming</text>
  <text start="853.23" dur="4.86">and it&amp;#39;ll be here in three</text>
  <text start="855.18" dur="5.28">well I would tell you get water get</text>
  <text start="858.09" dur="4.86">batteries get supplies because it is</text>
  <text start="860.46" dur="4.02">coming now you can believe me or not it</text>
  <text start="862.95" dur="3.48">doesn&amp;#39;t make a difference because I will</text>
  <text start="864.48" dur="4.98">be prepared other people will be</text>
  <text start="866.43" dur="5.43">prepared and when the storm hit it will</text>
  <text start="869.46" dur="3.96">be too late you&amp;#39;ll just sit there the</text>
  <text start="871.86" dur="3.57">storm will hit your electrical go out</text>
  <text start="873.42" dur="4.44">there&amp;#39;ll be no fresh water you won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="875.43" dur="4.35">able to get food and you will be stuck</text>
  <text start="877.86" dur="3.12">and at that point if you think well I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="879.78" dur="3.72">just going to run out and get that stuff</text>
  <text start="880.98" dur="5.61">now good luck with that it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="883.5" dur="5.46">very very difficult and this is to get</text>
  <text start="886.59" dur="4.98">people ready and prepared for what is</text>
  <text start="888.96" dur="5.94">coming this is what this is all about</text>
  <text start="891.57" dur="5.16">and you can take it either way I mean if</text>
  <text start="894.9" dur="4.32">you don&amp;#39;t believe it you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="896.73" dur="6.15">listen that&amp;#39;s your choice I mean let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="899.22" dur="5.19">go back to 2008 or prior to 2008 you</text>
  <text start="902.88" dur="3.12">know all those individuals that were</text>
  <text start="904.41" dur="2.96">looking at the subprime securities and</text>
  <text start="906" dur="3.15">looking inside the subprime securities</text>
  <text start="907.37" dur="5.26">saying something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="909.15" dur="6.86">because most of these are rated triple-a</text>
  <text start="912.63" dur="7.5">but we have defaulting loans in them</text>
  <text start="916.01" dur="6.4">subprime individuals some people own 3-4</text>
  <text start="920.13" dur="5.55">houses with no checks how could this</text>
  <text start="922.41" dur="5.13">possibly be this doesn&amp;#39;t make sense now</text>
  <text start="925.68" dur="3.51">a lot of people laughed at them they</text>
  <text start="927.54" dur="5.46">didn&amp;#39;t believe them they thought they</text>
  <text start="929.19" dur="6.3">were crazy and what happened was that</text>
  <text start="933" dur="4.83">what did it happen the next day no it</text>
  <text start="935.49" dur="4.74">happened the next year now it happened</text>
  <text start="937.83" dur="3.54">sometime later when everything that they</text>
  <text start="940.23" dur="4.23">were talking about everything they</text>
  <text start="941.37" dur="4.35">researched came true and all those</text>
  <text start="944.46" dur="4.53">people that were laughing</text>
  <text start="945.72" dur="5.43">well they were out of jobs they lost</text>
  <text start="948.99" dur="4.95">their life savings they lost their home</text>
  <text start="951.15" dur="4.38">and those people made billions and</text>
  <text start="953.94" dur="4.23">billions of dollars because they</text>
  <text start="955.53" dur="5.34">understood now again we do have</text>
  <text start="958.17" dur="6.3">manipulation the central bakers do have</text>
  <text start="960.87" dur="6.42">a way of keeping everything afloat until</text>
  <text start="964.47" dur="5.1">they want to bring it down and these</text>
  <text start="967.29" dur="5.58">individuals they couldn&amp;#39;t understand why</text>
  <text start="969.57" dur="5.4">it wasn&amp;#39;t collapsing sooner it made no</text>
  <text start="972.87" dur="4.53">sense to them well that was because the</text>
  <text start="974.97" dur="6.06">central bank was controlling everything</text>
  <text start="977.4" dur="5.7">just like they&amp;#39;re doing today but you</text>
  <text start="981.03" dur="3.72">know one thing is for sure because we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="983.1" dur="3.48">been looking at the research actually</text>
  <text start="984.75" dur="3.72">when we look at like retail if you go</text>
  <text start="986.58" dur="3.72">back to three years</text>
  <text start="988.47" dur="4.5">said it was online sales people said it</text>
  <text start="990.3" dur="4.92">was the snow well the snow doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>

  <text start="995.22" dur="5.94">create 50 bankruptcies online sales</text>
  <text start="998.37" dur="5.99">which is only 8 percent or so of total</text>
  <text start="1001.16" dur="5.1">retail sales that doesn&amp;#39;t destroy retail</text>
  <text start="1004.36" dur="4.36">people not working</text>
  <text start="1006.26" dur="5.79">destroys retail people not making an</text>
  <text start="1008.72" dur="6.51">income destroys retail because these</text>
  <text start="1012.05" dur="6.3">people can&amp;#39;t spend so we see the same</text>
