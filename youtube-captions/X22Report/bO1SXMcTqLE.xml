  <text start="87.74" dur="6.54">saying that the ultimate goal is to have</text>
  <text start="90.56" dur="5.37">complete control over the system Trump</text>
  <text start="94.28" dur="3.96">has been showing the deep stay in the</text>
  <text start="95.93" dur="4.86">central bank that he has complete</text>
  <text start="98.24" dur="3.93">control the only thing the mainstream</text>
  <text start="100.79" dur="5.07">media the central bank can do right now</text>
  <text start="102.17" dur="6.989">is put out fake stories and this is what</text>
  <text start="105.86" dur="6.48">they normally do to try to control the</text>
  <text start="109.159" dur="7.441">narrative but Trump controls something</text>
  <text start="112.34" dur="6.81">else now he controls these statistical</text>
  <text start="116.6" dur="5.339">numbers he controls the stock market</text>
  <text start="119.15" dur="4.92">think about when Obama was president for</text>
  <text start="121.939" dur="6.151">a minute here and when we were reporting</text>
  <text start="124.07" dur="5.85">on the economy and what Obama was doing</text>
  <text start="128.09" dur="4.47">what the central bank was doing at the</text>
  <text start="129.92" dur="4.92">time they had control over the</text>
  <text start="132.56" dur="5.459">mini-story media they had control over</text>
  <text start="134.84" dur="5.58">the statistics and the stock market so</text>
  <text start="138.019" dur="5.101">they could tell any story they wanted</text>
  <text start="140.42" dur="6.39">and it always turned out to be true</text>
  <text start="143.12" dur="7.339">because they were all in sync we have</text>
  <text start="146.81" dur="5.85">Trump now and the Patriots who are</text>
  <text start="150.459" dur="4.081">controlling and this is why Trump</text>
  <text start="152.66" dur="4.29">continually says he has the magic wand</text>
  <text start="154.54" dur="5.05">controlling the stats which are</text>
  <text start="156.95" dur="5.63">completely manipulated the stock market</text>
  <text start="159.59" dur="7.94">which is completely manipulated</text>
  <text start="162.58" dur="8.45">he controls that portion what is the</text>
  <text start="167.53" dur="6.18">mainstream media now have they have</text>
  <text start="171.03" dur="5.82">propaganda that&amp;#39;s all they have</text>
  <text start="173.71" dur="8.16">the central bank same thing propaganda</text>
  <text start="176.85" dur="6.91">now if the mainstream media is out there</text>
  <text start="181.87" dur="3.63">and they&amp;#39;re saying that the stock</text>
  <text start="183.76" dur="4.68">market&amp;#39;s coming down it looks like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="185.5" dur="4.29">all over the economy&amp;#39;s doomed Trump</text>
  <text start="188.44" dur="3.33">tweets out which he did right before</text>
  <text start="189.79" dur="4.02">Christmas hey watch the market I think</text>
  <text start="191.77" dur="3.69">this is a great time to buy and all of a</text>
  <text start="193.81" dur="3.81">sudden the market shot up a thousand</text>
  <text start="195.46" dur="4.41">points which proved the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="197.62" dur="4.05">to be wrong and it shows that Trump has</text>
  <text start="199.87" dur="3.78">control now the mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="201.67" dur="4.5">telling everyone that we&amp;#39;re heading into</text>
  <text start="203.65" dur="4.41">a recession in 2020 and it&amp;#39;s amazing how</text>
  <text start="206.17" dur="3.39">they can come up with the date they know</text>
  <text start="208.06" dur="4.77">exactly when of course this coincides</text>
  <text start="209.56" dur="6.24">with the election but Trump is going to</text>
  <text start="212.83" dur="5.07">show the world and the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="215.8" dur="5.04">and all those individuals who think that</text>
  <text start="217.9" dur="5.07">they still have control he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="220.84" dur="6.39">show them that they don&amp;#39;t remember going</text>
  <text start="222.97" dur="7.35">back to Q&amp;#39;s posts jool told us that they</text>
  <text start="227.23" dur="6.3">already understand that they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="230.32" dur="5.31">to bring down the economy during the</text>
  <text start="233.53" dur="4.65">2020 election that was their plan</text>
  <text start="235.63" dur="5.639">remember they need to get rid of Trump</text>
  <text start="238.18" dur="3.99">at all costs at this point and they have</text>
  <text start="241.269" dur="4.321">a couple of options</text>
  <text start="242.17" dur="5.4">impeach will not work because who</text>
  <text start="245.59" dur="4.11">controls the Senate well Republicans</text>
  <text start="247.57" dur="5">sold us control the Senate the Senate</text>
  <text start="249.7" dur="5.28">was the key that&amp;#39;s not going to work</text>
  <text start="252.57" dur="5.8">well they could try an assassination</text>
  <text start="254.98" dur="5.759">that could work and we&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of</text>
  <text start="258.37" dur="6.42">code messages messages about that and</text>
  <text start="260.739" dur="6.661">they might attempt it but again Trump</text>
  <text start="264.79" dur="4.08">using military intelligence they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="267.4" dur="3.09">hearing the chatter they understand</text>
  <text start="268.87" dur="5.46">what&amp;#39;s going on and they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="270.49" dur="8.19">prepared for it or they can try to make</text>
  <text start="274.33" dur="7.23">the economy look awful in 2020 now</text>
  <text start="278.68" dur="4.5">remember to get people angry and to get</text>
  <text start="281.56" dur="4.5">people pissed off what do you do you go</text>
  <text start="283.18" dur="5.25">after their wallets you go after their</text>
  <text start="286.06" dur="4.53">money they&amp;#39;re harder than savings so</text>
  <text start="288.43" dur="4.26">they figured listen we still have</text>
  <text start="290.59" dur="3">control the central bank right we still</text>
  <text start="292.69" dur="2.76">have control of the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="293.59" dur="2.59">right well they don&amp;#39;t have control of</text>
  <text start="295.45" dur="3.16">the central bank</text>
  <text start="296.18" dur="5.01">they think they do what we&amp;#39;ll do is</text>
  <text start="298.61" dur="7.13">we&amp;#39;ll tell them that we&amp;#39;re expecting a</text>
  <text start="301.19" dur="7.53">recession in 2020 to show that Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="305.74" dur="5.44">economic policies did not work and he</text>
  <text start="308.72" dur="5.61">should not be President that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="311.18" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re going to try to do now if we go</text>
  <text start="314.33" dur="4.589">to what Powell&amp;#39;s been saying well</text>
  <text start="316.28" dur="6.59">tariffs yeah they might have an effect</text>
  <text start="318.919" dur="6.541">long term but right now we see nothing</text>
  <text start="322.87" dur="4.57">tariffs are not going to bring down the</text>
  <text start="325.46" dur="4.62">economy the economy is built on an</text>
  <text start="327.44" dur="6.42">illusion Trump is controlling the</text>
  <text start="330.08" dur="5.91">illusion and what the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="333.86" dur="4.619">is going to do right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="335.99" dur="4.56">gonna try to make it look like anything</text>
  <text start="338.479" dur="5.581">that Trump is doing it&amp;#39;s going to look</text>
  <text start="340.55" dur="5.85">bad now we&amp;#39;re in there shut down and of</text>
  <text start="344.06" dur="4.44">course everyone&amp;#39;s worrying about the</text>
  <text start="346.4" dur="3.9">shutdown what effect is it going to have</text>
  <text start="348.5" dur="3.479">on the economy and the financial</text>
  <text start="350.3" dur="2.91">pundants in the mainstream media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="351.979" dur="3.81">all over the place and they&amp;#39;re crazy</text>
  <text start="353.21" dur="4.56">about it and we see White House Council</text>
  <text start="355.789" dur="3.781">of Economic Advisers chair Kevin Hassett</text>
  <text start="357.77" dur="4.44">warned that if the government shuts</text>
  <text start="359.57" dur="7.14">shutdown continues there&amp;#39;s a chance of</text>
  <text start="362.21" dur="6.72">zero growth in the first quarter now we</text>
  <text start="366.71" dur="4.56">know that the first quarter of every</text>
  <text start="368.93" dur="4.26">year it is always very low we&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="371.27" dur="3.24">out of the Christmas season people</text>
  <text start="373.19" dur="4.02">aren&amp;#39;t really purchasing remember</text>
  <text start="374.51" dur="5.1">seventy percent or so of GDP is made up</text>
  <text start="377.21" dur="3.42">of people going out and purchasing we</text>
  <text start="379.61" dur="2.64">know a lot of these numbers have been</text>
  <text start="380.63" dur="3.81">manipulated from the very beginning so</text>
  <text start="382.25" dur="4.68">we don&amp;#39;t really know if these numbers</text>
  <text start="384.44" dur="5.52">are true or not but the fake numbers</text>
  <text start="386.93" dur="5.4">show us that it slows in January now</text>
  <text start="389.96" dur="5.85">they&amp;#39;re saying if the government</text>
  <text start="392.33" dur="5.91">shutdown continues GDP will come to a</text>
  <text start="395.81" dur="6.979">screeching halt which shows us that our</text>
  <text start="398.24" dur="7.44">economy is dependent on the government</text>
  <text start="402.789" dur="5.831">well if 70 percent of the GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="405.68" dur="5.489">are spending of everyday Americans and</text>
  <text start="408.62" dur="4.919">only 30 percent and that number is even</text>
  <text start="411.169" dur="3.601">reduced with military spending and</text>
  <text start="413.539" dur="2.97">things like that because we have durable</text>
  <text start="414.77" dur="5.78">goods and other things which are</text>
  <text start="416.509" dur="7.41">separate in part but let&amp;#39;s take the 70%</text>
  <text start="420.55" dur="7.32">70% were dependent on government we have</text>
  <text start="423.919" dur="7.551">a major major problem because that</text>
  <text start="427.87" dur="5.4">the Fed is creating currency the</text>
  <text start="431.47" dur="5.419">government is borrowing that currency</text>
  <text start="433.27" dur="9.32">and the government is spending that</text>
  <text start="436.889" dur="9.581">currency to keep everything operational</text>
  <text start="442.59" dur="7.6">this is a problem now if the GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="446.47" dur="8.97">come in and they&amp;#39;re not zero it shows</text>
  <text start="450.19" dur="8.34">that Trump has the magic wand now of</text>
  <text start="455.44" dur="5.37">course what this individuals saying he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="458.53" dur="4.949">saying that listen the second quarter</text>
  <text start="460.81" dur="4.26">will probably see incredible growth to</text>
  <text start="463.479" dur="4.141">make up a difference in the first</text>
  <text start="465.07" dur="5.04">quarter so depending on how this is</text>
  <text start="467.62" dur="5.359">played they can show that this</text>
  <text start="470.11" dur="6.3">government controls the economy without</text>
  <text start="472.979" dur="6.401">borrowing without being in the central</text>
  <text start="476.41" dur="4.77">bank system this economy wouldn&amp;#39;t exist</text>
  <text start="479.38" dur="4.02">maybe it&amp;#39;s time to get out of this</text>
  <text start="481.18" dur="4.23">economy because this is not a free and</text>
  <text start="483.4" dur="4.829">open economy this means the people of</text>
  <text start="485.41" dur="5.91">the United States they&amp;#39;re not supporting</text>
  <text start="488.229" dur="5.341">the economy it&amp;#39;s only the government now</text>
  <text start="491.32" dur="5.67">if Trump decides to use the magic wand</text>
  <text start="493.57" dur="6.44">it will show all of us that he has</text>
  <text start="496.99" dur="5.64">complete and utter control of the system</text>
  <text start="500.01" dur="6.279">now the mainstream media they are</text>
  <text start="502.63" dur="6.69">pushing out stories that the White House</text>
  <text start="506.289" dur="5.611">is canceling the trade meetings with</text>
  <text start="509.32" dur="4.92">China they refuse to take their offer</text>
  <text start="511.9" dur="4.98">and it looks like the trade deals are</text>
  <text start="514.24" dur="4.95">completely off well right now the White</text>
  <text start="516.88" dur="3.99">House they denied me at the media report</text>
  <text start="519.19" dur="3.12">that it rejected a trade planning</text>
  <text start="520.87" dur="3.75">meeting with the Chinese officials this</text>
  <text start="522.31" dur="3.9">week because of disputes over the</text>
  <text start="524.62" dur="4.95">structural reforms that China had</text>
  <text start="526.21" dur="5.55">promised to make what really happened</text>
  <text start="529.57" dur="5.03">was is that the meetings are not set</text>
  <text start="531.76" dur="7.32">until the end of January</text>
  <text start="534.6" dur="5.739">China confirmed that Liu would travel to</text>
  <text start="539.08" dur="3.6">the Washington by the end of this month</text>
  <text start="540.339" dur="4.62">to hold meetings from January 30th to</text>
  <text start="542.68" dur="4.83">31st and they&amp;#39;re gonna have the meeting</text>
  <text start="544.959" dur="5.911">with Treasury secretary Steve minuchin</text>
  <text start="547.51" dur="6.09">and Robert leitzinger</text>
  <text start="550.87" dur="4.53">so it hasn&amp;#39;t even happened yet but</text>
  <text start="553.6" dur="4.07">they&amp;#39;re trying to put a spin on this</text>
  <text start="555.4" dur="6.239">that the trade talks aren&amp;#39;t going well</text>
  <text start="557.67" dur="6.669">with the United States and</text>
  <text start="561.639" dur="6.031">why because the mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="564.339" dur="6.331">desperately trying to take control they</text>
  <text start="567.67" dur="5.909">don&amp;#39;t have control the central bank does</text>
  <text start="570.67" dur="6.45">not have control the Patriots are in</text>
  <text start="573.579" dur="5.73">control of all of this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="577.12" dur="4.769">trying to figure this out because</text>
  <text start="579.309" dur="5.161">everything that they had planned is not</text>
  <text start="581.889" dur="4.26">working out but everything the Patriots</text>
  <text start="584.47" dur="6.089">have planned everything they have</text>
  <text start="586.149" dur="10.05">planned moving forward well it&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="590.559" dur="9.51">on track Trump is bringing back</text>
  <text start="596.199" dur="5.88">manufacturing Trump is manipulating the</text>
  <text start="600.069" dur="4.171">economy using their weapon against them</text>
  <text start="602.079" dur="4.291">so this way they can&amp;#39;t say anything</text>
  <text start="604.24" dur="4.319">against him about the economy that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="606.37" dur="5.339">they hardly even mention the economy in</text>
  <text start="608.559" dur="5.491">their mainstream media news reports and</text>
  <text start="611.709" dur="4.23">this is why trunk continually tweets out</text>
  <text start="614.05" dur="3.209">there you know the mainstream media they</text>
  <text start="615.939" dur="3.661">used to say the economy was very</text>
  <text start="617.259" dur="6.51">important now they say nothing because</text>
  <text start="619.6" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re hoping that in 2020 with what</text>
  <text start="623.769" dur="4.081">they have planned to bring in a</text>
  <text start="625.99" dur="4.589">recession and bring the economy down</text>
  <text start="627.85" dur="4.349">they&amp;#39;re hoping this will remove Trump</text>
  <text start="630.579" dur="5.641">remember they have all these plans set</text>
  <text start="632.199" dur="6.69">up but I do believe their move is going</text>
  <text start="636.22" dur="5.339">to be countered and they will not be</text>
  <text start="638.889" dur="4.32">able to push this recession because the</text>
  <text start="641.559" dur="2.64">numbers the statistical numbers and this</text>
  <text start="643.209" dur="2.19">is what they really look at they can</text>
  <text start="644.199" dur="2.7">look at set well the stock market still</text>
  <text start="645.399" dur="4.05">up oh look</text>
  <text start="646.899" dur="5.071">unemployment still very low oh look GDP</text>
  <text start="649.449" dur="6.51">numbers look still good it nothing&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="651.97" dur="5.729">happening now if Trump sees the economy</text>
  <text start="655.959" dur="2.701">deteriorate quickly because remember he</text>
  <text start="657.699" dur="3.81">only has a certain amount of time</text>
  <text start="658.66" dur="5.279">because there&amp;#39;s a statistical economy</text>
