  <text start="41.39" dur="4.919">episode is central bankers are now</text>
  <text start="43.4" dur="5.82">pushing the public to accept a cashless</text>

  <text start="58.67" dur="5.01">to have to keep the illusion alive and I</text>
  <text start="61.309" dur="4.201">mentioned back when gold was going up</text>
  <text start="63.68" dur="4.29">that most likely they&amp;#39;re going to push</text>
  <text start="65.51" dur="4.92">it down and we see that gold has been</text>
  <text start="67.97" dur="4.11">pushed down quite a bit I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>

  <text start="82.01" dur="6.12">paper notes and convert them into gold</text>
  <text start="85.22" dur="4.62">or silver and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="88.13" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re going to need to do this</text>
  <text start="89.84" dur="5.88">throughout this year because they are</text>
  <text start="93.08" dur="4.5">pushing as hard as they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="95.72" dur="4.23">keep the illusion alive that the economy</text>
  <text start="97.58" dur="5.73">is doing well but we know that the</text>

  <text start="385.339" dur="6.42">amazingly and actually the economy was</text>
  <text start="387.469" dur="6.81">much much better than and in certain</text>
  <text start="391.759" dur="5.491">areas we saw things completely fall</text>
  <text start="394.279" dur="4.471">apart and I know I lived in New York and</text>
  <text start="397.25" dur="3.27">things were falling apart but I called</text>

  <text start="419.18" dur="7.44">screeching halt and the entire real</text>
  <text start="422.839" dur="6.661">estate market collapsed this is what</text>
  <text start="426.62" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re going to see in each and every one</text>
  <text start="429.5" dur="3.87">of these areas</text>
  <text start="431.6" dur="4.2">it will spread do you think it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="433.37" dur="4.02">isolated to certain areas no most of</text>
  <text start="435.8" dur="4.26">these areas that you&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="437.39" dur="3.99">the central bankers chose okay we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="440.06" dur="3">going to build up this area this area</text>

  <text start="453.2" dur="6.57">come in they&amp;#39;ll pay cash this is why</text>
  <text start="455.33" dur="7.68">back in 2013 Wells Fargo Citibank JP</text>
  <text start="459.77" dur="5.82">Morgan Chase they all laid off their</text>
  <text start="463.01" dur="4.97">mortgage departments thousands upon</text>
  <text start="465.59" dur="4.83">thousands of people because they knew</text>
  <text start="467.98" dur="4.06">those coming in to purchase the home</text>
  <text start="470.42" dur="4.86">they were going to be cash buyers and</text>
  <text start="472.04" dur="6.03">they weren&amp;#39;t the everyday American now</text>
  <text start="475.28" dur="4.98">that is drying up and actually if you</text>
  <text start="478.07" dur="6.18">look at the graph for home sales new</text>
  <text start="480.26" dur="9.15">home sales it&amp;#39;s really flat line since</text>
  <text start="484.25" dur="8.25">the catastrophe of 2008 2009 we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="489.41" dur="7.97">gone anywhere we haven&amp;#39;t even reached</text>
  <text start="492.5" dur="8.82">the area of the 90s and we know that</text>
  <text start="497.38" dur="6.97">home ownership is at its lowest point</text>
  <text start="501.32" dur="5.22">right now we see manufacturing</text>
  <text start="504.35" dur="4.95">completely falling apart the Empire fed</text>
  <text start="506.54" dur="9.02">manufacturing survey has been in</text>
  <text start="509.3" dur="10.23">contraction for seven straight months</text>
  <text start="515.56" dur="6.34">now februari printed a little bit better</text>
  <text start="519.53" dur="6.2">than January it came in at negative</text>
  <text start="521.9" dur="7.76">sixteen point six for January was at-</text>
  <text start="525.73" dur="6.61">19.3 seven I wouldn&amp;#39;t call that better</text>
  <text start="529.66" dur="5.47">but what we&amp;#39;re saying what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="532.34" dur="4.26">right now is that it completely missed</text>
  <text start="535.13" dur="3.5">expectations they thought it was going</text>
  <text start="536.6" dur="4.32">to be negative 10 and we see that</text>
  <text start="538.63" dur="4.75">manufacturing is continually declining</text>
  <text start="540.92" dur="5.22">the Baltic Dry Index popped up a little</text>
  <text start="543.38" dur="4.71">bit to 301 and everyone&amp;#39;s saying oh look</text>
  <text start="546.14" dur="6.81">the Baltic Dry Index is on its way up</text>
  <text start="548.09" dur="7.83">it&amp;#39;s at 301 still the lowest point we</text>
  <text start="552.95" dur="6.24">have ever seen since the Baltic Dry</text>
  <text start="555.92" dur="8.79">Index was started this is not a sign of</text>
  <text start="559.19" dur="6.93">a recovery that everything is fine yes</text>
  <text start="564.71" dur="4.83">the bolt the droid x is going to pop up</text>
  <text start="566.12" dur="5.55">and down when we see the Baltic Dry</text>
  <text start="569.54" dur="6.21">Index hit nine hundred seven hundred a</text>
  <text start="571.67" dur="8.67">thousand then we can talk but right now</text>
  <text start="575.75" dur="8.61">we&amp;#39;re seeing at 301 we see that Russia</text>
  <text start="580.34" dur="7.02">Saudi Arabia Iran and the other OPEC</text>
  <text start="584.36" dur="7.16">members they were in a discussion on</text>
  <text start="587.36" dur="9.78">about freezing or increasing or</text>
  <text start="591.52" dur="7.8">decreasing the oil supplies and what</text>
  <text start="597.14" dur="6.45">they decided on was absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="599.32" dur="8.53">they&amp;#39;re going to freeze right now where</text>
  <text start="603.59" dur="5.61">we are and keep this level and then</text>
  <text start="607.85" dur="5.43">we&amp;#39;ll leave it up to the other OPEC</text>
  <text start="609.2" dur="8.57">members if they like to abide by this</text>
  <text start="613.28" dur="8.76">Iran already says I don&amp;#39;t think so so</text>
  <text start="617.77" dur="6.69">right now oil is going to be kept steady</text>
  <text start="622.04" dur="5.25">so we don&amp;#39;t see the fluctuations in</text>
  <text start="624.46" dur="6.16">prices and we could see at this point</text>
  <text start="627.29" dur="7.56">right now that oil is kept very very low</text>
  <text start="630.62" dur="7.49">and it&amp;#39;s done on purpose for many</text>
  <text start="634.85" dur="7.08">different agendas now we talked about</text>
  <text start="638.11" dur="7.84">how the ECB is trying to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="641.93" dur="7.89">500 euro note and we also talked about</text>
  <text start="645.95" dur="5.1">how that might spread to the US and they</text>
  <text start="649.82" dur="2.75">might come up with something like</text>
  <text start="651.05" dur="6.29">getting rid of the hundred-dollar bill</text>
  <text start="652.57" dur="8.56">well very interestingly Larry Summers</text>
  <text start="657.34" dur="7.02">release an op-ed where he said it&amp;#39;s time</text>
  <text start="661.13" dur="5.7">to kill the 100-dollar bill and</text>
  <text start="664.36" dur="4.09">basically he makes an argument of why we</text>
  <text start="666.83" dur="6.27">don&amp;#39;t need this and how we can stop</text>
  <text start="668.45" dur="6.63">crime well when we really look at this</text>
  <text start="673.1" dur="5.22">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="675.08" dur="4.62">taking the larger bills and I&amp;#39;ve no they</text>
  <text start="678.32" dur="2.67">done this in the past where they got rid</text>
  <text start="679.7" dur="2.94">of the thousand-dollar bill the five</text>
  <text start="680.99" dur="5.34">hundred dollar bill and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="682.64" dur="6.21">keep going just just remember back in</text>
  <text start="686.33" dur="4.2">time when the government said okay we</text>
  <text start="688.85" dur="4.08">need to bring revenue into the country</text>
  <text start="690.53" dur="4.05">we&amp;#39;re only going to tax the super</text>
  <text start="692.93" dur="4.05">wealthy we&amp;#39;re not going to do the</text>
  <text start="694.58" dur="3.93">wealthy the middle class the poor don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="696.98" dur="3.83">you worry about it</text>
  <text start="698.51" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s okay well what they do is they</text>
  <text start="700.81" dur="6.7">slowly do this to bring you in and once</text>
  <text start="704.18" dur="4.95">they have that tax stabilized they say</text>
  <text start="707.51" dur="3.69">okay you know something we don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="709.13" dur="4.05">rough enough right now so we need to</text>
  <text start="711.2" dur="5.46">move down to the next level this is what</text>
  <text start="713.18" dur="6.33">they&amp;#39;re doing at this point so 1.4</text>
  <text start="716.66" dur="6.39">trillion in total US currency is in</text>
  <text start="719.51" dur="6.87">circulation 1.1 trillion is in the form</text>
  <text start="723.05" dur="6.81">of one hundred dollar bills eliminate</text>
  <text start="726.38" dur="5.52">those and suddenly there is nowhere to</text>
  <text start="729.86" dur="6.29">hide from those trillions and negative</text>
  <text start="731.9" dur="7.98">interest rates yielding bank deposits</text>
  <text start="736.15" dur="5.95">Lawrence Summers urged countries around</text>
  <text start="739.88" dur="6.18">the world to agree to stop issuing high</text>
  <text start="742.1" dur="6.09">denomination banknotes even better than</text>
  <text start="746.06" dur="4.02">unilateral measures in Europe would be a</text>
  <text start="748.19" dur="4.65">global agreement to stop issuing notes</text>
