  <text start="76.28" dur="3.78">rapidly and we&amp;#39;ve been looking at all</text>
  <text start="78.259" dur="4.081">the indicators and indicators are</text>
  <text start="80.06" dur="4.38">pointing towards a recession or</text>
  <text start="82.34" dur="3.69">something much much worse than that and</text>
  <text start="84.44" dur="2.76">we know what that&amp;#39;s going to be it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="86.03" dur="4.17">going to be collapsed on the entire</text>
  <text start="87.2" dur="5.85">system now the central bankers know this</text>
  <text start="90.2" dur="6.18">Trump knows this they realize that this</text>
  <text start="93.05" dur="7.2">system is coming down and there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="96.38" dur="7.939">to fix it this is a central banking</text>
  <text start="100.25" dur="7.17">system it is designed and developed to</text>
  <text start="104.319" dur="5.621">basically crash and burn at a certain</text>
  <text start="107.42" dur="4.68">point that&amp;#39;s where we are right now</text>
  <text start="109.94" dur="4.8">there&amp;#39;s nothing else they can do to fix</text>
  <text start="112.1" dur="4.68">this so what is happening right now is</text>
  <text start="114.74" dur="5.1">we are seeing all these economic</text>
  <text start="116.78" dur="4.86">indicators basically showing us that</text>
  <text start="119.84" dur="4.25">we&amp;#39;re already in a recession probably</text>
  <text start="121.64" dur="4.589">heading towards a deep depression and</text>
  <text start="124.09" dur="5.11">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is</text>
  <text start="126.229" dur="5.431">continually manipulating the economy to</text>
  <text start="129.2" dur="4.08">keep everything operational to make</text>
  <text start="131.66" dur="4.26">people believe that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="133.28" dur="4.11">and they manipulate GDP they manipulate</text>
  <text start="135.92" dur="4.23">unemployment they manipulate pretty much</text>
  <text start="137.39" dur="5.189">everything to make us believe everything</text>
  <text start="140.15" dur="7.41">is fine now the stock market is a huge</text>
  <text start="142.579" dur="7.801">gigantic manipulation and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="147.56" dur="5.64">seeing right now is the manipulation is</text>
  <text start="150.38" dur="4.32">about to end now when we look at all</text>
  <text start="153.2" dur="4.14">these different economic indicators we</text>
  <text start="154.7" dur="6.539">see like home sales they&amp;#39;re down 4.4</text>
  <text start="157.34" dur="6.119">percent year over a year and the housing</text>
  <text start="161.239" dur="3.151">market is continually declining if we</text>
  <text start="163.459" dur="4.56">look at the pending home sales</text>
  <text start="164.39" dur="6.48">year-over-year since 2014 as we came out</text>
  <text start="168.019" dur="4.44">of the Great Recession it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="170.87" dur="3.78">declining ever since because what they</text>
  <text start="172.459" dur="4.201">did was they pumped it up they pumped up</text>
  <text start="174.65" dur="3.959">as much as they possibly can and now it</text>
  <text start="176.66" dur="4.199">is not working anymore the central</text>
  <text start="178.609" dur="4.831">bankers they realize this they realize</text>
  <text start="180.859" dur="4.74">that everything that they&amp;#39;ve done is not</text>
  <text start="183.44" dur="3.06">working and everything is starting to</text>
  <text start="185.599" dur="4.651">fall apart very</text>
  <text start="186.5" dur="7.08">that&amp;#39;s why they are now pushing interest</text>
  <text start="190.25" dur="4.8">rates up now the LIBOR is continually</text>
  <text start="193.58" dur="3.24">moving up and up and up</text>
  <text start="195.05" dur="3.54">and as they continually move the</text>
  <text start="196.82" dur="4.16">interest rates up we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="198.59" dur="6">problems in the real estate market the</text>
  <text start="200.98" dur="6.34">auto loan industry the student loan</text>
  <text start="204.59" dur="6.39">industry and you&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot of</text>
  <text start="207.32" dur="5.37">things completely go wrong now when we</text>
  <text start="210.98" dur="4.35">look at what is happening here we</text>
  <text start="212.69" dur="6.75">understand that Trump has already</text>
  <text start="215.33" dur="6.6">implemented tariffs we can see that he</text>
  <text start="219.44" dur="5.19">cancelled the TPP NAFTA&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="221.93" dur="5.01">negotiations and he&amp;#39;s looking to get rid</text>
  <text start="224.63" dur="4.74">of all these like globalist trade type</text>
  <text start="226.94" dur="4.44">of systems and go into bilateral trades</text>
  <text start="229.37" dur="5.49">between countries</text>
  <text start="231.38" dur="5.31">because he realizes that this is the</text>
  <text start="234.86" dur="5.73">approach that the United States needs to</text>
  <text start="236.69" dur="8.37">take and what he needs to do right now</text>
  <text start="240.59" dur="8.07">is he needs to control the narrative of</text>
  <text start="245.06" dur="4.92">the collapsing economy and basically</text>
  <text start="248.66" dur="3.96">then make a move to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="249.98" dur="5.52">central bank so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="252.62" dur="5.19">now with everything that is going on we</text>
  <text start="255.5" dur="4.68">can see this is where he is headed and</text>
  <text start="257.81" dur="3.84">we already see that out in Europe</text>
  <text start="260.18" dur="3.239">they&amp;#39;re short dollars what looks like</text>
  <text start="261.65" dur="4.829">we&amp;#39;re heading towards a liquidity crisis</text>
  <text start="263.419" dur="5.281">we also see right now because of what&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="363.5" dur="7.009">the very beginning and we can see right</text>
  <text start="366.289" dur="8.041">now that as we move forward he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>

  <text start="400.46" dur="6.209">the death of the Fed and we can see by</text>
  <text start="403.969" dur="6.151">doing all of this and by bringing down</text>

  <text start="452" dur="2.76">realize what the pig</text>
  <text start="453.32" dur="4.32">pictures going to be I don&amp;#39;t think they</text>
  <text start="454.76" dur="6.21">realize the scope of all this on what</text>
  <text start="457.64" dur="7.08">Trump Xi Jingping Putin what they are</text>
  <text start="460.97" dur="6.54">preparing to do they&amp;#39;re preparing to get</text>
  <text start="464.72" dur="6.18">rid of the central bank to get rid of</text>
  <text start="467.51" dur="6.66">the Federal Reserve to cut off the deep</text>
  <text start="470.9" dur="6.03">state to cut off pretty much everything</text>
  <text start="474.17" dur="5.31">and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="476.93" dur="4.83">think about what is happening at this</text>
  <text start="479.48" dur="2.91">time everyone was looking at the stock</text>
  <text start="481.76" dur="2.7">market</text>
  <text start="482.39" dur="3.42">everyone thought whoa the stock market&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="484.46" dur="4.38">going to continually move up and up and</text>
  <text start="485.81" dur="5.64">up once you start hitting face but once</text>
  <text start="488.84" dur="4.98">you start hitting Google once you start</text>
  <text start="491.45" dur="5.13">hitting Amazon once you start doing all</text>
  <text start="493.82" dur="5.13">of this stuff it brings the market down</text>
  <text start="496.58" dur="4.41">and this is what we are seeing and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="498.95" dur="6.81">going to continually decline because as</text>
  <text start="500.99" dur="8.28">the FTC investigates Facebook and people</text>
  <text start="505.76" dur="5.88">lose confidence in Facebook and then the</text>
  <text start="509.27" dur="4.53">FTC says okay let&amp;#39;s start looking at</text>
  <text start="511.64" dur="3.75">other social media Giants let&amp;#39;s start</text>
  <text start="513.8" dur="4.08">looking at Amazon let&amp;#39;s look at</text>
  <text start="515.39" dur="3.57">Microsoft let&amp;#39;s look at Google let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="517.88" dur="3.42">look at YouTube</text>
  <text start="518.96" dur="6.09">well these is this is the tech sector</text>
  <text start="521.3" dur="9.27">and the stocks will decline this will</text>
  <text start="525.05" dur="8.1">bring down the stock market and what are</text>
  <text start="530.57" dur="5.01">they gonna say I mean how would you</text>
  <text start="533.15" dur="5.01">manipulate this to make it look like</text>
  <text start="535.58" dur="4.77">that this isn&amp;#39;t happening</text>
  <text start="538.16" dur="5.13">what can the central bankers do even if</text>
  <text start="540.35" dur="4.71">they have a button to push if all these</text>
  <text start="543.29" dur="5.13">tech companies are being investigated</text>
  <text start="545.06" dur="5.4">and the market starts to come down yes</text>
  <text start="548.42" dur="3.57">they can push a button and push these</text>
  <text start="550.46" dur="3.42">stocks back up but that would be</text>
  <text start="551.99" dur="2.76">ridiculous because people would say well</text>
  <text start="553.88" dur="3.47">way to me they&amp;#39;re all in a vet</text>
  <text start="554.75" dur="4.47">investigation they&amp;#39;re being looked into</text>
  <text start="557.35" dur="4.03">people are pulling out of there</text>
  <text start="559.22" dur="5.04">Zuckerberg and the rest they&amp;#39;re selling</text>
  <text start="561.38" dur="4.77">their stocks Facebook might be broken up</text>
  <text start="564.26" dur="4.62">I mean think about what is happening</text>
  <text start="566.15" dur="5.55">here right now everything is being put</text>
  <text start="568.88" dur="5.34">into place to control the narrative to</text>
  <text start="571.7" dur="6.78">bring down the system and it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="574.22" dur="5.73">done one part at a time and when you</text>
  <text start="578.48" dur="4.32">start putting all these pieces together</text>
  <text start="579.95" dur="6.75">you can see how this is being done</text>
  <text start="582.8" dur="6.54">I mean first with tariffs</text>
  <text start="586.7" dur="5.07">with reciprocal taxes by getting rid of</text>
  <text start="589.34" dur="4.98">all the globalists framework that was</text>
  <text start="591.77" dur="4.08">put into place by setting up bilateral</text>
  <text start="594.32" dur="6.33">trades and a lot of this is also being</text>
  <text start="595.85" dur="6.84">done for after the reset we also see a</text>
  <text start="600.65" dur="4.95">liquidity crisis we also see the Middle</text>
  <text start="602.69" dur="4.92">East where the petrol yuyuan will start</text>
  <text start="605.6" dur="4.44">to take over and the petro dollar will</text>
  <text start="607.61" dur="5.4">be dumped we see that China and Russia</text>
  <text start="610.04" dur="6.78">has amassing a huge amount of gold to</text>
  <text start="613.01" dur="6.45">build confidence to protect the pet the</text>
  <text start="616.82" dur="4.23">petrol you want and to protect the new</text>
  <text start="619.46" dur="3.9">system so people say okay you know</text>
  <text start="621.05" dur="4.98">something let me see what the US has</text>
  <text start="623.36" dur="4.11">compared to what China and Russia have</text>
  <text start="626.03" dur="3.27">they have the one belt one road they</text>
  <text start="627.47" dur="5.22">have the manufacturing they have all the</text>
  <text start="629.3" dur="6.15">gold they have this petrol you won they</text>

  <text start="642.07" dur="9.04">the US have well they have no gold the</text>
  <text start="647.36" dur="6.57">US has a huge amount of debt countries</text>
  <text start="651.11" dur="3.57">are dumping the Treasuries dumping the</text>
  <text start="653.93" dur="4.89">petrodollar</text>
  <text start="654.68" dur="7.53">confidence is being lost and right now</text>
  <text start="658.82" dur="4.74">we see that the entire system is being</text>
  <text start="662.21" dur="3.75">dismantled right in front of our eyes</text>
  <text start="663.56" dur="4.74">and we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot more of this</text>
  <text start="665.96" dur="4.86">as we move forward so we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="668.3" dur="4.95">the stock market decline we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="670.82" dur="4.98">a liquidity crisis we&amp;#39;re gonna see a</text>

  <text start="682.61" dur="3.06">they&amp;#39;re gonna be devaluation and the</text>
  <text start="683.96" dur="3.69">dollar that means we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="685.67" dur="5.01">inflation and eventually we&amp;#39;ll turn into</text>
  <text start="687.65" dur="4.74">hyperinflation we&amp;#39;re gonna see gold move</text>
  <text start="690.68" dur="3.81">up yes they&amp;#39;re gonna try to slam it down</text>
  <text start="692.39" dur="3.75">yes they can try to control the central</text>
  <text start="694.49" dur="2.97">banks are gonna think that they still</text>
  <text start="696.14" dur="3.03">have the ability to do what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="697.46" dur="4.41">doing in the past but they will</text>
