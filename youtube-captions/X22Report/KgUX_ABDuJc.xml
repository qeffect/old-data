  <text start="28.679" dur="5.711">hi and welcome to the x 22 report this</text>
  <text start="31.539" dur="5.281">is a special edition of The X 22 report</text>
  <text start="34.39" dur="4.71">we are going to interview Gregory</text>
  <text start="36.82" dur="6.239">Mannarino today and we like to welcome</text>
  <text start="39.1" dur="6.75">Gregory to the x 22 report and we are</text>
  <text start="43.059" dur="9.541">going to start off here with the first</text>
  <text start="45.85" dur="12.24">question for Gregory so basically what I</text>
  <text start="52.6" dur="8.459">wanted to ask you and I don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="58.09" dur="6.359">you think this the financial collapse is</text>
  <text start="61.059" dur="7.35">going to come about but where do you</text>
  <text start="64.449" dur="8.881">think it&amp;#39;s going to happen first and how</text>
  <text start="68.409" dur="7.801">do you think it&amp;#39;s going to you know lay</text>
  <text start="73.33" dur="5.07">out in terms of what are there any signs</text>
  <text start="76.21" dur="7.22">are there is there anything that we</text>
  <text start="78.4" dur="5.03">should be watching in the world oh</text>
  <text start="83.85" dur="5.17">absolutely well a couple of things let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="86.71" dur="4.38">look number one at the action of the</text>
  <text start="89.02" dur="5.879">world&amp;#39;s central banks something I</text>
  <text start="91.09" dur="6.059">address all the time they are trying to</text>
  <text start="94.899" dur="5.031">print their way out of this problem and</text>
  <text start="97.149" dur="6">all they&amp;#39;re doing is making this</text>
  <text start="99.93" dur="5.68">monumentally worse did they distorted</text>
  <text start="103.149" dur="4.4">everything from equity markets the</text>
  <text start="105.61" dur="4.56">currency markets to bond markets</text>
  <text start="107.549" dur="6.731">everything is suffering at this point</text>
  <text start="110.17" dur="6.15">and I always tell people if you really</text>
  <text start="114.28" dur="4.53">want to see what&amp;#39;s happening you got to</text>
  <text start="116.32" dur="5.759">focus not on the Dow Jones Industrial</text>
  <text start="118.81" dur="5.46">Average not on the sp500 but on the bond</text>
  <text start="122.079" dur="4.11">market the bond market is where this</text>
  <text start="124.27" dur="5.04">whole thing in my opinion is going to</text>
  <text start="126.189" dur="5.491">really unfold no we saw some serious</text>
  <text start="129.31" dur="5.73">action and it&amp;#39;s not getting the</text>
  <text start="131.68" dur="4.42">attention it should with regard to to</text>
  <text start="135.04" dur="3.31">bond yields the 10</text>
  <text start="136.1" dur="6.92">you specifically which is kind of like</text>
  <text start="138.35" dur="7.8">the benchmark um it&amp;#39;s fallen off a cliff</text>
  <text start="143.02" dur="4.96">it&amp;#39;s literally crashed and I think</text>
  <text start="146.15" dur="4.59">people started to panic and we saw that</text>
  <text start="147.98" dur="7.5">affected the market but at the same time</text>
  <text start="150.74" dur="8.25">all of this in my opinion it is is an</text>
  <text start="155.48" dur="7.16">incredibly coordinated attempt by the</text>
  <text start="158.99" dur="7.5">Federal Reserve to elicit specific</text>
  <text start="162.64" dur="5.83">actions in the markets I do believe they</text>
  <text start="166.49" dur="4.17">felt the market was getting a little</text>
  <text start="168.47" dur="5.25">head of itself and I&amp;#39;m referring to the</text>
  <text start="170.66" dur="4.89">Dow Jones S&amp;amp;P 100 now so what did they</text>
  <text start="173.72" dur="3.48">do they came out they spook the market</text>
  <text start="175.55" dur="3.57">we pulled back we saw bond yields rise</text>
  <text start="177.2" dur="3.96">they they want this to a certain degree</text>
  <text start="179.12" dur="5.1">they understand and there&amp;#39;s no way they</text>
  <text start="181.16" dur="5.64">can understand this that this issue that</text>
  <text start="184.22" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;ve created regarding debt regarding</text>
  <text start="186.8" dur="6.21">market distortions um it can only end</text>
  <text start="189.53" dur="7.29">one way and that is very very badly for</text>
  <text start="193.01" dur="6.69">most of people again all this boils down</text>
  <text start="196.82" dur="5.94">to is they&amp;#39;re trying to print their way</text>
  <text start="199.7" dur="5.64">out of a debt problem adding debt and</text>
  <text start="202.76" dur="6.15">compounding that problem and by doing so</text>
  <text start="205.34" dur="6.39">I&amp;#39;ve created very dangerous distortions</text>
  <text start="208.91" dur="6">as players I can say it in the market</text>
  <text start="211.73" dur="5.82">and and at one point all of this all of</text>
  <text start="214.91" dur="6">this is going to correct a fair market</text>
  <text start="217.55" dur="5.7">value that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s a fact and when</text>
  <text start="220.91" dur="3.6">that happens i think many people are</text>
  <text start="223.25" dur="3.96">going to be caught off guard especially</text>
  <text start="224.51" dur="5.79">the unsophisticated person and they are</text>
  <text start="227.21" dur="4.62">gonna lose it all everything they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="230.3" dur="3.21">going to be left desperate and destitute</text>
  <text start="231.83" dur="3.21">and some people on the other side of</text>
  <text start="233.51" dur="5.61">that trade are gonna make out like</text>
  <text start="235.04" dur="7.41">bandits do let me ask you this do you do</text>
  <text start="239.12" dur="8.58">you see a Treasury bond sell-off right</text>
  <text start="242.45" dur="9.71">now are you seeing like major investors</text>
  <text start="247.7" dur="6.57">or anyone selling off bonds at that time</text>
  <text start="252.16" dur="3.94">absolutely look at what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="254.27" dur="4.74">we have it we have estimates upward of</text>
  <text start="256.1" dur="7.56">just over the past few weeks i think is</text>
  <text start="259.01" dur="6.27">saying 125 150 billion has fled the bond</text>
  <text start="263.66" dur="4.35">markets over the past few weeks just</text>
  <text start="265.28" dur="4.2">because of these these issues with the</text>
  <text start="268.01" dur="4.08">with the Federal Reserve talking about</text>
  <text start="269.48" dur="4.68">tapering which can never happen it can</text>
  <text start="272.09" dur="4.29">never happen i want you to understand</text>
  <text start="274.16" dur="5.01">that and that&amp;#39;s why the market rallied</text>
  <text start="276.38" dur="4.47">the other day um it wasn&amp;#39;t because of a</text>
  <text start="279.17" dur="3.69">good job she points because of a bad</text>
  <text start="280.85" dur="4.8">jobs report we understand that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="282.86" dur="5.7">bleeding manufacturing jobs so yes money</text>
  <text start="285.65" dur="4.35">is leaving the bond market now and that</text>
  <text start="288.56" dur="3.99">you keep hearing about this great</text>
  <text start="290" dur="4.5">rotation great location you know I hate</text>
  <text start="292.55" dur="3.72">when I hear that because I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="294.5" dur="3.51">these people in didn&amp;#39;t understand what</text>
  <text start="296.27" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re talking about but they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="298.01" dur="3.99">to convince people owe money is leaving</text>
  <text start="300.44" dur="3.36">the bond market is entering equities</text>
  <text start="302" dur="4.61">exactly is a place to be well in many</text>
  <text start="303.8" dur="4.8">ways the Fed is forcing people into</text>
  <text start="306.61" dur="3.58">equities and that&amp;#39;s what scares me the</text>
  <text start="308.6" dur="2.64">most because the average guide the</text>
  <text start="310.19" dur="3.57">average girl is going to get on the</text>
  <text start="311.24" dur="4.02">bandwagon here and and start buying</text>
  <text start="313.76" dur="3.21">leases and that&amp;#39;s all well and good they</text>
  <text start="315.26" dur="3.6">might make money as the market Rises</text>
  <text start="316.97" dur="3.78">because it will at least here in the</text>
  <text start="318.86" dur="3.42">short run because the Fed is going to</text>
  <text start="320.75" dur="4.29">backstop it but they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="322.28" dur="4.8">know when to sell and and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.04" dur="4.19">what the half is the top of every single</text>
  <text start="327.08" dur="5.64">bubble and then the unsophisticated</text>
  <text start="329.23" dur="5.26">investor is going to lose it all and I</text>
  <text start="332.72" dur="3.81">think that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s important for</text>
  <text start="334.49" dur="3.93">people to educate themselves regarding</text>
  <text start="336.53" dur="4.17">this moment have an understanding words</text>
  <text start="338.42" dur="4.95">to going on because in the end in the</text>
  <text start="340.7" dur="4.26">end what this all comes down to and I</text>
  <text start="343.37" dur="3.78">outlined is at length in my book</text>
  <text start="344.96" dur="5.22">depositors of money is a the</text>
  <text start="347.15" dur="6.15">availability of resources for people on</text>
  <text start="350.18" dur="4.98">the one point going to become scarce</text>
  <text start="353.3" dur="3.57">people going to scramble for them are</text>
  <text start="355.16" dur="3.63">going to see already seeing it on a</text>
  <text start="356.87" dur="3.84">global scale social unrest lights if</text>
  <text start="358.79" dur="3.6">you&amp;#39;ve never seen we&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="360.71" dur="3.81">that here in the United States to again</text>
  <text start="362.39" dur="4.53">why because resources are going to</text>
  <text start="364.52" dur="4.32">become scarce as the dollar dies the</text>
  <text start="366.92" dur="4.2">dollar in my opinion is in a terminal</text>
  <text start="368.84" dur="4.71">phase it&amp;#39;s been in a terminal phase for</text>
  <text start="371.12" dur="4.08">a very very long time well despite the</text>
  <text start="373.55" dur="4.35">fact that we&amp;#39;ve seen some strength in</text>
  <text start="375.2" dur="4.08">the dollar lately let&amp;#39;s just go back ten</text>
  <text start="377.9" dur="3.75">years in the customer the dollar was</text>
  <text start="379.28" dur="7.49">then coupee until now it is just a bump</text>
  <text start="381.65" dur="7.62">or a blip in my opinion in in a</text>
  <text start="386.77" dur="6.01">mechanism that is this in many ways is</text>
  <text start="389.27" dur="6.15">designed to kill the dollar and then</text>
  <text start="392.78" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re definitely in a currency war on on</text>
  <text start="395.42" dur="4.05">a global level and all the central banks</text>
  <text start="397.76" dur="4.08">are engaged in this and who&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="399.47" dur="6.15">suffer the people</text>
  <text start="401.84" dur="6.24">now do you let me ask you this since the</text>
  <text start="405.62" dur="5.49">people are selling loft Treasury bonds</text>
  <text start="408.08" dur="6.75">and they&amp;#39;re putting it into the equity</text>
  <text start="411.11" dur="6.48">market do you what do you think is going</text>
  <text start="414.83" dur="3.899">to happen that&amp;#39;s on the United States</text>
  <text start="417.59" dur="3.21">I&amp;#39;d what do you think it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="418.729" dur="6.72">happen with Japan with all their money</text>
  <text start="420.8" dur="7.77">printing its old in bed we you can go</text>
  <text start="425.449" dur="5.071">back to history and just see how all of</text>
  <text start="428.57" dur="4.129">these types of schemes have ended it</text>
  <text start="430.52" dur="5.1">will printing money out of thin air and</text>
  <text start="432.699" dur="6.241">dispersing it just does one thing it</text>
  <text start="435.62" dur="6.39">kills the currency it takes cash away or</text>
  <text start="438.94" dur="5.4">purchasing power away from the many and</text>
  <text start="442.01" dur="4.89">gives it to Anna it&amp;#39;s just a way of</text>
  <text start="444.34" dur="4.66">redistributing wealth and that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="446.9" dur="5.01">what this is all coming down to as well</text>
  <text start="449" dur="6.63">on a global scale we&amp;#39;re seeing things</text>
  <text start="451.91" dur="5.759">that we&amp;#39;ve been never seen before um you</text>
  <text start="455.63" dur="3.96">know it all goes back to when we started</text>
  <text start="457.669" dur="3.181">hearing about the European debt crisis</text>
  <text start="459.59" dur="2.91">European debt crisis is that I think</text>
  <text start="460.85" dur="3.48">that&amp;#39;s when people started to come aware</text>
  <text start="462.5" dur="3.479">of it and how are they trying to solve</text>
  <text start="464.33" dur="3.899">it they&amp;#39;re trying to solve a debt</text>
  <text start="465.979" dur="4.471">problem by adding more debt it won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="468.229" dur="4.381">work it will miss like getting it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="470.45" dur="4.5">taking a drowning man and throwing water</text>
  <text start="472.61" dur="4.98">on them to try to save it it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="474.95" dur="5.76">to it can&amp;#39;t happen the system is is</text>
  <text start="477.59" dur="5.88">malignant and it&amp;#39;s terminal at this</text>
  <text start="480.71" dur="6.179">point again in my opinion and we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="483.47" dur="8.009">watching what i called the side effect</text>
  <text start="486.889" dur="9.601">unfold in again I sincerely believe that</text>
  <text start="491.479" dur="8.581">the crash of 2007-2008 was the party</text>
  <text start="496.49" dur="5.52">over moment what we&amp;#39;re in now is is just</text>
  <text start="500.06" dur="7.41">a side effect and this side of that is</text>
  <text start="502.01" dur="7.08">terminal it cannot end well um well let</text>
  <text start="507.47" dur="5.069">me let me rephrase that is going to end</text>
  <text start="509.09" dur="6.03">very well for some people and by and</text>
  <text start="512.539" dur="5.041">large most people are going to get</text>
  <text start="515.12" dur="4.409">everything they have everything they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="517.58" dur="4.98">worked for taken away and getting</text>
  <text start="519.529" dur="4.891">redistributed to other people who are on</text>
  <text start="522.56" dur="5.31">the other side of that trade it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="524.42" dur="5.76">the same story um and and that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="527.87" dur="4.38">what i&amp;#39;m trying to do with with my blog</text>
  <text start="530.18" dur="3.57">and my book is trying to you know put a</text>
  <text start="532.25" dur="3.48">perspective on this that maybe people</text>
  <text start="533.75" dur="4.23">don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="535.73" dur="6.599">you think Japan is going to fall before</text>
  <text start="537.98" dur="7.979">the collapse here in America you know</text>
  <text start="542.329" dur="5.19">this I think that all of the situation</text>
  <text start="545.959" dur="5.49">at all the central banks have created</text>
  <text start="547.519" dur="5.82">bubbles and dead bubbles it and once one</text>
  <text start="551.449" dur="4.14">starts to crack and you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="553.339" dur="3.421">they&amp;#39;re scrambling here to keep the debt</text>
  <text start="555.589" dur="3.421">the debt problem over here in Europe</text>
  <text start="556.76" dur="4.079">going they&amp;#39;re all going to pop around</text>
  <text start="559.01" dur="3.81">the same time I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="560.839" dur="5.49">to go here and people going to even have</text>
  <text start="562.82" dur="4.62">a chance to look back look at their</text>
  <text start="566.329" dur="4.32">investments or whatever they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="567.44" dur="5.25">and or even from a survivalist</text>
  <text start="570.649" dur="4.291">standpoint and say okay I better do a</text>
  <text start="572.69" dur="5.699">better take action now because when one</text>
  <text start="574.94" dur="4.769">of these things burst and I you know</text>
  <text start="578.389" dur="3.541">it&amp;#39;s hard to say where is it really</text>
  <text start="579.709" dur="5.19">going to start it&amp;#39;s already started in</text>
  <text start="581.93" dur="5.25">my opinion and again we&amp;#39;re just seeing</text>
  <text start="584.899" dur="4.05">this kind of slow roll right now and</text>
  <text start="587.18" dur="4.2">that&amp;#39;s what I really want you to focus</text>
  <text start="588.949" dur="5.551">on the bond mark in the United States</text>
  <text start="591.38" dur="7.319">especially because we&amp;#39;re the biggest</text>
  <text start="594.5" dur="6.329">economy and when we start to see more</text>
  <text start="598.699" dur="4.291">action like we&amp;#39;re seeing now it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="600.829" dur="4.351">to at one point and again again this</text>
  <text start="602.99" dur="4.5">isn&amp;#39;t my thing and snowball and control</text>
  <text start="605.18" dur="4.68">and then we&amp;#39;re going to see bond yields</text>
  <text start="607.49" dur="4.5">rise at an uncontrollable rate and what</text>
  <text start="609.86" dur="3.93">is the Fed going to do the Fed is going</text>
  <text start="611.99" dur="3.51">to try to step in there and buy all the</text>
  <text start="613.79" dur="3.539">bonds to suppress those rich but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="615.5" dur="3.959">not going to work it can have the</text>
  <text start="617.329" dur="3.81">printed cash in thin air to buy these</text>
  <text start="619.459" dur="4.49">bonds and what&amp;#39;s that going to do it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="621.139" dur="6.481">going to start a vicious cycle so as</text>
  <text start="623.949" dur="5.561">that unfolds what is that is going to</text>
  <text start="627.62" dur="3.6">put enormous pressure on equities and</text>
  <text start="629.51" dur="4.11">that&amp;#39;s going to wipe out the stock</text>
  <text start="631.22" dur="4.26">market banks are going to close it was</text>
  <text start="633.62" dur="3.51">going to be bank runs of what bank runs</text>
  <text start="635.48" dur="3.39">and whatever cash people think they have</text>
  <text start="637.13" dur="3.449">in those banks will be done and besides</text>
  <text start="638.87" dur="5.61">that it would be worthless at that point</text>
  <text start="640.579" dur="6.301">so I think um it&amp;#39;s all of this is going</text>
  <text start="644.48" dur="4.74">to come down at around the same time</text>
  <text start="646.88" dur="4.019">period and it&amp;#39;s good and it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="649.22" dur="3.239">to be slow right now we&amp;#39;re seeing I</text>
  <text start="650.899" dur="4.49">guess you would say a small role in</text>
  <text start="652.459" dur="6.11">sense but once we hit that moment where</text>
  <text start="655.389" dur="8.14">this fear and panic well that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="658.569" dur="7.151">there&amp;#39;s going to be no no way to you</text>
  <text start="663.529" dur="3.911">know at that moment step up its okay I</text>
  <text start="665.72" dur="3.4">better do something now so</text>
  <text start="667.44" dur="3.6">people need to understand the mechanism</text>
  <text start="669.12" dur="4.68">behind it all or just in where this is</text>
  <text start="671.04" dur="5.55">going and how they can maybe protect</text>
  <text start="673.8" dur="5.52">themselves again as we move forward let</text>
  <text start="676.59" dur="8.97">me let me just change gears right now</text>
  <text start="679.32" dur="10.44">and let me ask you the Cypress ballon do</text>
  <text start="685.56" dur="8.67">you think that is a template for the</text>
  <text start="689.76" dur="7.88">European and America do you think that</text>
  <text start="694.23" dur="6.21">eventually they will do the balance and</text>
  <text start="697.64" dur="5.8">freeze accounts and take people&amp;#39;s money</text>
  <text start="700.44" dur="4.92">because right now in Cyprus I mean they</text>
  <text start="703.44" dur="4.35">told us two weeks for capital controls</text>
  <text start="705.36" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s been over a hundred days do you</text>
  <text start="707.79" dur="6.21">think this is we&amp;#39;re going to see this in</text>
  <text start="709.92" dur="6.15">Europe and in America I really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="714" dur="5.13">believe that I think this was a test bed</text>
  <text start="716.07" dur="6.45">um and they want to see how people going</text>
  <text start="719.13" dur="6.42">to react to that and again most people</text>
  <text start="722.52" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t even realize what you just said</text>
  <text start="725.55" dur="3.15">and they feel completely disconnected</text>
  <text start="726.87" dur="4.62">from no it doesn&amp;#39;t affect me it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="728.7" dur="4.92">bothering me really well it will in my</text>
  <text start="731.49" dur="4.53">opinion because these bail outs aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="733.62" dur="4.26">working so there will be bail-ins at one</text>
  <text start="736.02" dur="3.81">point and how you&amp;#39;re going to structure</text>
  <text start="737.88" dur="3.72">it they&amp;#39;re probably going to say okay</text>
  <text start="739.83" dur="4.29">you know we&amp;#39;re gonna we&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="741.6" dur="4.41">your money to bail to do this and take</text>
  <text start="744.12" dur="4.14">this action to save this institution but</text>
  <text start="746.01" dur="4.29">in return we&amp;#39;re going to you know give</text>
  <text start="748.26" dur="4.7">you these bonds or whatever so some</text>
  <text start="750.3" dur="6.96">something is going to come out of it</text>
  <text start="752.96" dur="5.95">again it just all plays into everything</text>
  <text start="757.26" dur="3.75">that you know people like you people</text>
  <text start="758.91" dur="4.64">like me at your told you about is</text>
  <text start="761.01" dur="5.85">getting you understand that the system</text>
  <text start="763.55" dur="5.44">cannot stand and without these valiums</text>
  <text start="766.86" dur="4.14">or bailouts or whatever that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="768.99" dur="4.92">going to throw it as next it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="771" dur="6.57">terminal system we&amp;#39;ve reached the point</text>
  <text start="773.91" dur="6.27">where the acquisition of debt it has</text>
  <text start="777.57" dur="7.7">become a poisonous and that is going to</text>
  <text start="780.18" dur="8.55">collapse the entire system globally and</text>
  <text start="785.27" dur="6.97">okay I mean we are we all understand</text>
  <text start="788.73" dur="7.41">that the collapse is coming and I I mean</text>
  <text start="792.24" dur="6.39">a lot of people and like wherever you</text>
  <text start="796.14" dur="5.1">look you actually see things happening</text>
  <text start="798.63" dur="5.28">and people talking about that</text>
  <text start="801.24" dur="5.37">something is not right but a lot of</text>
  <text start="803.91" dur="6.06">times people don&amp;#39;t know what to do with</text>
  <text start="806.61" dur="5.82">their money so let&amp;#39;s say people have</text>
  <text start="809.97" dur="5.07">money in the bank and they&amp;#39;re afraid of</text>
  <text start="812.43" dur="6.15">balance people have money in the stock</text>
  <text start="815.04" dur="5.12">market or the Treasury market and they</text>
  <text start="818.58" dur="3.84">don&amp;#39;t want to keep all of their money</text>
  <text start="820.16" dur="5.38">there at this point or they have</text>
  <text start="822.42" dur="7.859">retirement and they want to move their</text>
  <text start="825.54" dur="6.72">retirement money out of the retirement</text>
  <text start="830.279" dur="4.801">because they&amp;#39;re afraid that you know</text>
  <text start="832.26" dur="6.21">that that might be taken from them in</text>
  <text start="835.08" dur="8.34">your opinion where what should people do</text>
  <text start="838.47" dur="7.26">with their livelihood with their all</text>
  <text start="843.42" dur="4.35">their money depending on which you know</text>
  <text start="845.73" dur="5.1">market they have it in I mean is there</text>
  <text start="847.77" dur="4.74">any safe place you got there was once a</text>
  <text start="850.83" dur="3.9">place in my opinion and I&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="852.51" dur="4.769">this for years I&amp;#39;ve been acquiring hard</text>
  <text start="854.73" dur="5.13">assets if I don&amp;#39;t own a gold mine or a</text>

  <text start="862.89" dur="5.939">and silver are real money there and</text>
  <text start="866.64" dur="5.069">despite what Ben Bernanke wants to say</text>
  <text start="868.829" dur="4.801">about it yeah that they hold this for</text>
  <text start="871.709" dur="5.781">tradition the central bank&amp;#39;s all well</text>
  <text start="873.63" dur="10.05">aware that these are finite assets and</text>
  <text start="877.49" dur="10.75">they are indeed real money I without</text>
  <text start="883.68" dur="6.42">even the slightest doubt can tell people</text>
  <text start="888.24" dur="3.57">that they need to be in that they need</text>
  <text start="890.1" dur="5.1">to be in hard assets they need to get</text>
  <text start="891.81" dur="6.269">out of the fiat currency game that has</text>
  <text start="895.2" dur="7.56">been forced upon them by these</text>
  <text start="898.079" dur="7.801">institutions and start realizing that</text>
  <text start="902.76" dur="5.22">the system is rigged against them period</text>
  <text start="905.88" dur="4.47">and the way to get out of it again it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="907.98" dur="4.799">the whole goal and the whole silver and</text>
  <text start="910.35" dur="3.989">you know these prices that we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="912.779" dur="3.691">I&amp;#39;ve been dollar cost averaging is</text>
  <text start="914.339" dur="4.44">medals for years I will continue to do</text>
  <text start="916.47" dur="3.75">that I can only pray that they go lower</text>
  <text start="918.779" dur="3.451">because I will just keep buying more</text>
  <text start="920.22" dur="4.2">because I understand in the long run</text>
  <text start="922.23" dur="4.859">these have nowhere to go but up but if</text>
  <text start="924.42" dur="5.73">people just want to look at history look</text>
  <text start="927.089" dur="5.281">at every time every single time bar none</text>
  <text start="930.15" dur="4.05">that we&amp;#39;ve seen a correction like this</text>
  <text start="932.37" dur="6.1">with regard to go</text>
  <text start="934.2" dur="7.15">they rebounded hundreds of percent so</text>
  <text start="938.47" dur="5.16">that should tell people something people</text>
  <text start="941.35" dur="4.489">should be big wedding this stuff at</text>
  <text start="943.63" dur="5.34">every chance they get every sphere of</text>
  <text start="945.839" dur="5.231">the Fiat that they have lien around they</text>
  <text start="948.97" dur="4.08">should be investing in gold physical</text>
  <text start="951.07" dur="3.75">gold physical so we&amp;#39;ll forget the paper</text>
  <text start="953.05" dur="3.36">market the paper markets are nonsense</text>
  <text start="954.82" dur="5.13">them uniquely they&amp;#39;re not real snow</text>
  <text start="956.41" dur="7.98">price discovery and and that in my</text>
  <text start="959.95" dur="7.41">opinion is the ultimate safe ayman in</text>
  <text start="964.39" dur="5.28">this environment with then my I mean how</text>
  <text start="967.36" dur="5.22">high do you think gold and silver and</text>
  <text start="969.67" dur="5.46">platinum and play having right now gold</text>
  <text start="972.58" dur="5.73">you know has been smacked down silver</text>
  <text start="975.13" dur="6.33">has been smacked down and do you think</text>
  <text start="978.31" dur="5.7">we&amp;#39;ve hit bottom now do you think that</text>
  <text start="981.46" dur="5.01">we still have further to go down in the</text>
  <text start="984.01" dur="6">metals or do you think metals will start</text>
  <text start="986.47" dur="5.07">rising well you know what&amp;#39;s with the</text>
  <text start="990.01" dur="3.12">boulder manipulation that goes on here</text>
  <text start="991.54" dur="3.06">in the paper marca so let me just</text>
  <text start="993.13" dur="3.54">establish this there are a lot of people</text>
  <text start="994.6" dur="3.87">who gawk at that they do not believe the</text>
  <text start="996.67" dur="4.109">people markets are manipulated but</text>
  <text start="998.47" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re willing to concede that the</text>
  <text start="1000.779" dur="3.81">Federal Reserve is in fact manipulating</text>
  <text start="1002.82" dur="3.54">the bond market by buying bonds and</text>
  <text start="1004.589" dur="4.081">courtesy mothers by printing currency</text>
  <text start="1006.36" dur="4.71">but they won&amp;#39;t believe but the metals</text>
  <text start="1008.67" dur="4.7">markets are manipulated it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1011.07" dur="4.62">beyond me okay there there&amp;#39;s no doubt</text>
  <text start="1013.37" dur="4.87">whatsoever in my mind that they are</text>
  <text start="1015.69" dur="4.38">manipulate be manipulated in there it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1018.24" dur="5.819">done with purpose to affect perception</text>
  <text start="1020.07" dur="6.15">so um are they at the bottom I would</text>
  <text start="1024.059" dur="4.861">like to believe they are very very close</text>
  <text start="1026.22" dur="5.849">why well because we understand that</text>
  <text start="1028.92" dur="5.73">there is a cost of production regarding</text>
  <text start="1032.069" dur="6.421">these metals and we are at that or even</text>
  <text start="1034.65" dur="5.7">below by certain estimates right now but</text>
  <text start="1038.49" dur="4.189">because of the momentum behind it and</text>
  <text start="1040.35" dur="5.16">because of the game that they play uh</text>
  <text start="1042.679" dur="5.171">you know if it may fall somewhat further</text>
  <text start="1045.51" dur="5.46">although I can&amp;#39;t imagine much but again</text>
  <text start="1047.85" dur="4.92">in my opinion I hope it does I will buy</text>
  <text start="1050.97" dur="4.74">more because I understand that the</text>
  <text start="1052.77" dur="5.19">long-term prospects are going to be</text>
  <text start="1055.71" dur="4.86">multiple hundred percent higher than</text>
  <text start="1057.96" dur="4.59">they are now and there are many many</text>
  <text start="1060.57" dur="6.69">ways to gauge this you can look at the</text>
  <text start="1062.55" dur="8.07">gold today ratio over time I</text>
  <text start="1067.26" dur="5.94">I believe that due to the Federal</text>
  <text start="1070.62" dur="7.32">Reserve&amp;#39;s action in in hyper inflating</text>
  <text start="1073.2" dur="8.25">the stock market a major major crash or</text>
  <text start="1077.94" dur="6.45">question is coming we are probably going</text>
  <text start="1081.45" dur="4.83">to see a doubt a goal ratio at least one</text>
  <text start="1084.39" dur="4.2">to one more three two one favoring goal</text>
  <text start="1086.28" dur="4.74">in my book the politics money I outline</text>
  <text start="1088.59" dur="6.03">see everywhere the Dow can go to 4000</text>
  <text start="1091.02" dur="5.34">and gold will go to 8,000 so I have a</text>
  <text start="1094.62" dur="3.99">two to one for your main goal even had a</text>
  <text start="1096.36" dur="4.55">one to one which I you know you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1098.61" dur="6.72">looking at four thousand dollar bill and</text>
  <text start="1100.91" dur="8.95">and and so were 150 to 500 depending on</text>
  <text start="1105.33" dur="7.14">how extreme this goes um you know but</text>
  <text start="1109.86" dur="4.71">there are a lot of people out there more</text>
  <text start="1112.47" dur="4.86">people who are coming up with very</text>
  <text start="1114.57" dur="4.8">similar numbers so you know I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1117.33" dur="5.43">believe that we&amp;#39;re all that far off you</text>
  <text start="1119.37" dur="6.72">know people need to realize is they need</text>
  <text start="1122.76" dur="5.94">to to act on it now while these prices</text>
  <text start="1126.09" dur="4.5">are surprised because at one time again</text>
  <text start="1128.7" dur="4.95">this this goes back to my period that</text>
  <text start="1130.59" dur="6.3">this isn&amp;#39;t going to be a slow burn when</text>
  <text start="1133.65" dur="6">when fear grips the markets it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1136.89" dur="5.31">to be rapid so you get you you may end</text>
  <text start="1139.65" dur="4.95">up seeing moves in gold multiple</text>
  <text start="1142.2" dur="6.63">hundreds of dollars in a day at one</text>
  <text start="1144.6" dur="6.12">point and I really think people need to</text>
  <text start="1148.83" dur="4.53">understand the mechanism behind it all</text>
  <text start="1150.72" dur="4.86">and that the the world&amp;#39;s central banks</text>
  <text start="1153.36" dur="4.35">no matter how much they try they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1155.58" dur="4.23">really not on the side of the people</text>
  <text start="1157.71" dur="4.29">that would love a try to make believe</text>
  <text start="1159.81" dur="4.83">excuse me they&amp;#39;re not on our side these</text>
  <text start="1162" dur="6.15">are private cartels run by the big banks</text>
  <text start="1164.64" dur="6.06">and their bottom line is not the welfare</text>

  <text start="1170.7" dur="4.32">their families and a friends period with</text>
  <text start="1173.52" dur="3.63">that in mind you can understand with the</text>
  <text start="1175.02" dur="5.46">sole going this is a setup in my opinion</text>
  <text start="1177.15" dur="6.15">the Federal Reserve is a serial bubble</text>
  <text start="1180.48" dur="6.72">blower they create boom-and-bust cycles</text>

  <text start="1203.82" dur="5.64">coming and you think they are preparing</text>
  <text start="1206.159" dur="5.52">for some type of collapse because in</text>
  <text start="1209.46" dur="5.219">your latest videos you seem to lead into</text>
  <text start="1211.679" dur="6.3">that that something and the government</text>

  <text start="1220.95" dur="4.409">they&amp;#39;re not stupid they completely</text>
  <text start="1222.33" dur="4.829">understand where this is going there</text>
  <text start="1225.359" dur="3.331">they&amp;#39;ve already said they&amp;#39;re setting up</text>

  <text start="1285.749" dur="3.691">more unhappy and I&amp;#39;ll tell you what</text>
  <text start="1287.729" dur="2.611">that&amp;#39;s going to start my opinion is</text>
  <text start="1289.44" dur="3.719">going to be to youth the youth</text>
  <text start="1290.34" dur="5.009">unemployment it is staggering even here</text>
  <text start="1293.159" dur="4.921">in the United States and these young</text>
  <text start="1295.349" dur="5.851">people are going to realize that hey you</text>
  <text start="1298.08" dur="4.649">know what the American Dream is not real</text>
  <text start="1301.2" dur="4.859">I cannot achieve this under this</text>
  <text start="1302.729" dur="4.861">oppressive environment and government</text>
  <text start="1306.059" dur="4.62">and what they&amp;#39;re trying to do to it so</text>
  <text start="1307.59" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re going to rebound uh and I think</text>
  <text start="1310.679" dur="3.69">that&amp;#39;s for the move in in all countries</text>
  <text start="1311.97" dur="4.769">you start with those young people who</text>
  <text start="1314.369" dur="5.13">are forced to maybe live with their</text>
  <text start="1316.739" dur="4.89">parents or a work at mundane jobs</text>
  <text start="1319.499" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re earning minimum wage or what or</text>
  <text start="1321.629" dur="3.75">whatever they have to do but there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1323.669" dur="3.541">doubt in my mind that the social unrest</text>
  <text start="1325.379" dur="4.23">that we&amp;#39;re seeing all over the world is</text>
  <text start="1327.21" dur="4.199">going to happen here as well the United</text>
  <text start="1329.609" dur="3.651">States is not immune to this despite the</text>
  <text start="1331.409" dur="4.881">fact that that</text>
  <text start="1333.26" dur="4.44">the politicians and and and all of them</text>
  <text start="1336.29" dur="3.57">they want you to believe the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="1337.7" dur="5.01">immune to all these problems which is</text>
  <text start="1339.86" dur="4.94">completely because let me ask you I mean</text>
  <text start="1342.71" dur="6.33">this is I&amp;#39;m going to go back now to</text>
  <text start="1344.8" dur="8.56">videos no it&amp;#39;s probably maybe a year ago</text>
  <text start="1349.04" dur="9.03">and you used to talk about the collapse</text>
  <text start="1353.36" dur="9.36">is going to be like a nuclear explosion</text>
  <text start="1358.07" dur="7.05">or something in that realm them when you</text>
  <text start="1362.72" dur="4.82">said that like what what exactly do you</text>
  <text start="1365.12" dur="7.89">mean that the collapse will be like a</text>
  <text start="1367.54" dur="10.15">nuclear attack on the US well what I</text>
  <text start="1373.01" dur="9.06">really was trying to convey is the the</text>
  <text start="1377.69" dur="6.57">damage or the loss of life that will be</text>
  <text start="1382.07" dur="5.01">inflicted on a global scale because of</text>
  <text start="1384.26" dur="4.74">this collapse will be on par with a</text>
  <text start="1387.08" dur="4.26">nuclear exchange it&amp;#39;s very simple to</text>
  <text start="1389" dur="4.53">understand why again this will this</text>
  <text start="1391.34" dur="4.77">whole thing as we move forward and</text>
  <text start="1393.53" dur="5.16">deeper into this collapse here is going</text>
  <text start="1396.11" dur="5.19">to be the availability of resources for</text>
  <text start="1398.69" dur="5.58">people that how they can feed themselves</text>
  <text start="1401.3" dur="6.45">or support themselves or or have shelter</text>
  <text start="1404.27" dur="5.94">as as this system begins continue to</text>
  <text start="1407.75" dur="5.34">deteriorate these again resources will</text>
  <text start="1410.21" dur="5.52">become scarce people will not be able to</text>
  <text start="1413.09" dur="4.56">acquire basic things to live and this is</text>
  <text start="1415.73" dur="4.23">what people are going to riot in the</text>
  <text start="1417.65" dur="4.65">streets and unfortunately probably</text>
  <text start="1419.96" dur="4.44">resort to violence against each other</text>
  <text start="1422.3" dur="4.14">and that&amp;#39;s why again the police is</text>
  <text start="1424.4" dur="5.69">instead of handing us they understand</text>
  <text start="1426.44" dur="6.42">where this is going I think we are</text>
  <text start="1430.09" dur="6.13">staring into the abyss my friend and and</text>
  <text start="1432.86" dur="6.93">there&amp;#39;s no way out of it I the reset</text>
  <text start="1436.22" dur="6.45">button is going to be one that will be</text>
  <text start="1439.79" dur="5.76">talked about for thousands of years and</text>
  <text start="1442.67" dur="5.61">then the the sad part to this whole</text>
  <text start="1445.55" dur="5.79">thing is it never happened it never had</text>
  <text start="1448.28" dur="5.88">had if they simply would have allowed</text>
  <text start="1451.34" dur="5.67">the market to do its job and that was</text>
  <text start="1454.16" dur="5.46">the sequester 2007-2008 was just a flea</text>
  <text start="1457.01" dur="4.26">market trying to establish fair market</text>
  <text start="1459.62" dur="3.84">value across the board it wasn&amp;#39;t allowed</text>
  <text start="1461.27" dur="3.81">to do that the fitters re-inflated that</text>
  <text start="1463.46" dur="2.35">equity bubble they&amp;#39;re trying to reflate</text>
  <text start="1465.08" dur="3.12">a housing</text>
  <text start="1465.81" dur="4.89">and to doing that defense of the dollar</text>
  <text start="1468.2" dur="4.33">they&amp;#39;re killing develop you can&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="1470.7" dur="3.24">can&amp;#39;t be in cash because if you&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="1472.53" dur="3.06">cash you&amp;#39;re being paid interest less</text>
  <text start="1473.94" dur="4.77">than the rate of inflation if it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="1475.59" dur="4.47">the bank you can&amp;#39;t be in bonds right now</text>
  <text start="1478.71" dur="3.39">you see what&amp;#39;s going on so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1480.06" dur="4.08">forcing people into equities and that</text>
  <text start="1482.1" dur="3.75">tells me something if they were forcing</text>
  <text start="1484.14" dur="3.3">people into equities why do they want</text>
  <text start="1485.85" dur="3.57">you there but when people in the end</text>
  <text start="1487.44" dur="4.08">equities on the forces up market higher</text>
  <text start="1489.42" dur="3.75">because the higher they can inflate that</text>
  <text start="1491.52" dur="4.14">bubble and I think we&amp;#39;re getting copy</text>
  <text start="1493.17" dur="4.53">now the greater the correction is going</text>
  <text start="1495.66" dur="3.81">to be and transferable wealth is going</text>
  <text start="1497.7" dur="3.81">to be that&amp;#39;s really what this whole</text>
  <text start="1499.47" dur="4.62">thing comes down to a resource is a</text>
  <text start="1501.51" dur="4.71">transfer of wealth personally I think</text>
  <text start="1504.09" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;re going back to a feudal system I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1506.22" dur="3.96">been talking about for a very long time</text>
  <text start="1507.69" dur="5.97">the haves and have-nots the middle class</text>
  <text start="1510.18" dur="6.48">will not exist in several years let me</text>
  <text start="1513.66" dur="6.06">for the final question let me ask you do</text>
  <text start="1516.66" dur="6.84">you think the US will be the reserve</text>
  <text start="1519.72" dur="6.03">currency going forward or do you think</text>
  <text start="1523.5" dur="4.23">the the US dollar will be dropped and</text>
  <text start="1525.75" dur="5.34">another currency will be put in its</text>
  <text start="1527.73" dur="5.25">place I think that China wants the</text>
  <text start="1531.09" dur="3.48">world&amp;#39;s reserve currency they want it</text>
  <text start="1532.98" dur="3.3">for a very long time they&amp;#39;ve been trying</text>
  <text start="1534.57" dur="3.09">to position themselves that way that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1536.28" dur="4.95">why they were quarrying will this gold</text>
  <text start="1537.66" dur="6.42">the US dollar is right now as as we know</text>
  <text start="1541.23" dur="6.84">losing its reserve status around the</text>
  <text start="1544.08" dur="6.42">world um I do not believe the US will</text>
  <text start="1548.07" dur="4.11">always be the world reserve it hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1550.5" dur="6.15">always been the world is ever protect</text>
  <text start="1552.18" dur="7.08">civil reserve currencies um the dollar</text>
  <text start="1556.65" dur="4.92">will maybe play some role in it unless</text>
  <text start="1559.26" dur="4.05">is replaced by a completely new system</text>
  <text start="1561.57" dur="6.21">which really isn&amp;#39;t out of the realm of</text>
  <text start="1563.31" dur="5.79">reality at all um there may be a basket</text>
  <text start="1567.78" dur="4.62">of currencies are going to put together</text>
  <text start="1569.1" dur="7.47">as a reserve or may turn out to be in my</text>
  <text start="1572.4" dur="5.7">opinion we&amp;#39;re going back to a currency</text>
  <text start="1576.57" dur="4.32">this is which is either fact or</text>
  <text start="1578.1" dur="5.43">partially back by a hard asset and that</text>
  <text start="1580.89" dur="5.37">us that movie goal why gold because gold</text>
  <text start="1583.53" dur="4.38">is the most stable asset the world has</text>
  <text start="1586.26" dur="4.98">ever seen despite the swings that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1587.91" dur="5.03">seen if you look over time you will see</text>
  <text start="1591.24" dur="6.08">if that plays out to be the truth but</text>
  <text start="1592.94" dur="5.51">the US dollar is being systematically</text>
  <text start="1597.32" dur="4.55">destroy</text>
  <text start="1598.45" dur="5.67">made by the Federal Reserve by</text>
  <text start="1601.87" dur="5.73">policymakers they understand where this</text>
  <text start="1604.12" dur="5.82">is going and believe me they are are</text>
  <text start="1607.6" dur="5.28">well aware of this and I&amp;#39;ll put putting</text>
  <text start="1609.94" dur="5.34">themselves in the right spots as you as</text>
