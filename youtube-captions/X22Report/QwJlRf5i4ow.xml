  <text start="53.29" dur="4.74">hi and welcome you&amp;#39;re listening to the X</text>
  <text start="56.38" dur="5.16">we need to report my name is Dave and</text>
  <text start="58.03" dur="6.24">this is episode 1580 a.n today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.54" dur="6.03">May 30th 2018 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="64.27" dur="6.57">episode is minutia ins name moves up on</text>
  <text start="67.57" dur="5.73">the list let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="70.84" dur="4.74">collapse financial news now it looks</text>
  <text start="73.3" dur="4.44">like the ADP numbers they came out today</text>
  <text start="75.58" dur="5.13">and we know that these employment</text>
  <text start="77.74" dur="4.29">numbers are manipulated we know the BLS</text>
  <text start="80.71" dur="2.82">they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating for a very</text>
  <text start="82.03" dur="4.05">long time they change the calculation</text>
  <text start="83.53" dur="3.839">the same with ADP and we&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="86.08" dur="3.539">through some of the things that the Fed</text>
  <text start="87.369" dur="5.131">has said and what the corporate media</text>
  <text start="89.619" dur="4.351">has said and what is really happening in</text>
  <text start="92.5" dur="2.55">the jobs market because a lot if it</text>
  <text start="93.97" dur="3.66">doesn&amp;#39;t even make sense</text>
  <text start="95.05" dur="3.959">just like the retail market doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="97.63" dur="3.36">sense we&amp;#39;re gonna discuss that also</text>
  <text start="99.009" dur="4.351">because a lot of people think that the</text>
  <text start="100.99" dur="4.86">retail industry is not doing well</text>
  <text start="103.36" dur="4.83">because of online and we&amp;#39;re gonna show</text>
  <text start="105.85" dur="4.71">that online really doesn&amp;#39;t have that</text>
  <text start="108.19" dur="6.84">much to do with what&amp;#39;s going on in the</text>
  <text start="110.56" dur="5.25">brick-and-mortar area or sector and we</text>
  <text start="115.03" dur="3.75">see right now</text>
  <text start="115.81" dur="7.73">Maes ADP employment numbers they printed</text>
  <text start="118.78" dur="7.8">lower than expected around 170,000 and</text>
  <text start="123.54" dur="5.35">this is the second Lotus lowest ADP</text>
  <text start="126.58" dur="4.05">print since October and of course what</text>
  <text start="128.89" dur="4.05">they did was they revised some numbers</text>
  <text start="130.63" dur="5.25">and they&amp;#39;re telling us that the hot job</text>
  <text start="132.94" dur="5.43">market has cooled slightly as the labor</text>
  <text start="135.88" dur="5.43">market continues to tighten and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="138.37" dur="6.54">saying that they can&amp;#39;t find people to</text>
  <text start="141.31" dur="7.5">fill these jobs now this is a simple</text>
  <text start="144.91" dur="7.35">supply and demand situation now if you</text>
  <text start="148.81" dur="6.87">cannot find people to fill the jobs you</text>
  <text start="152.26" dur="7.56">offer more money if you go back to the</text>
  <text start="155.68" dur="6.839">late 90s and the tech boom error moving</text>
  <text start="159.82" dur="4.56">into the 2000s they couldn&amp;#39;t find people</text>
  <text start="162.519" dur="4.291">to take the job so what happened was the</text>
  <text start="164.38" dur="5.669">salaries continually went up and up and</text>
  <text start="166.81" dur="4.44">up to find qualified people for people</text>
  <text start="170.049" dur="3.561">to go back to school they saw the</text>
  <text start="171.25" dur="6.93">salaries what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is that</text>
  <text start="173.61" dur="7.42">the wages they&amp;#39;re not moving up and if</text>
  <text start="178.18" dur="6.6">you can&amp;#39;t find people you have to bring</text>
  <text start="181.03" dur="5.61">them in some way somehow so already this</text>
  <text start="184.78" dur="5.67">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="186.64" dur="5.96">and if we look at this entire situation</text>
  <text start="190.45" dur="6.06">and there&amp;#39;s just not enough people to</text>
  <text start="192.6" dur="6.25">take these jobs then companies would</text>
  <text start="196.51" dur="4.74">want to keep their employees and you</text>
  <text start="198.85" dur="5.07">would see since we&amp;#39;re in this incredible</text>
  <text start="201.25" dur="6.36">recovery since 2008 we would see that</text>
  <text start="203.92" dur="7.2">people would be getting raises so if the</text>
  <text start="207.61" dur="7.74">job market is so great why aren&amp;#39;t many</text>
  <text start="211.12" dur="6.78">people getting pay raises this is kind</text>
  <text start="215.35" dur="4.62">of odd and you really think about it</text>
  <text start="217.9" dur="4.59">why aren&amp;#39;t wages increasing at the same</text>
  <text start="219.97" dur="6">exact time so think about this for a</text>
  <text start="222.49" dur="5.88">second a high percentage of American</text>
  <text start="225.97" dur="5.88">workers still aren&amp;#39;t getting pay raises</text>
  <text start="228.37" dur="6.36">nine years after the end of the Great</text>
  <text start="231.85" dur="5.07">Recession the Kansas City Fed</text>
  <text start="234.73" dur="4.259">researchers found that abnormally high</text>
  <text start="236.92" dur="4.89">share of employees still in the same</text>
  <text start="238.989" dur="5.401">jobs haven&amp;#39;t received a pay raise in the</text>
  <text start="241.81" dur="5.16">last 12 months despite a 3.9 percent</text>
  <text start="244.39" dur="6.39">unemployment rate this is the lowest</text>
  <text start="246.97" dur="5.19">almost in two decades and economists are</text>
  <text start="250.78" dur="3.84">scratching their heads going we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="252.16" dur="5.31">understand this because normally when</text>
  <text start="254.62" dur="4.679">you see this wages tend to rise between</text>
  <text start="257.47" dur="4.31">three and a half and four and a half per</text>
  <text start="259.299" dur="6.091">year and they&amp;#39;re not seeing this</text>
  <text start="261.78" dur="6.61">whatsoever so the question is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="265.39" dur="5.91">going on well before we answer that</text>
  <text start="268.39" dur="4.35">let&amp;#39;s go into the retail industry and</text>
  <text start="271.3" dur="4.83">let&amp;#39;s talk about what&amp;#39;s happening there</text>
  <text start="272.74" dur="6.9">now we know the brick-and-mortar stores</text>
  <text start="276.13" dur="5.25">they are hurting and we know that online</text>
  <text start="279.64" dur="3.24">sales they&amp;#39;ve been picking up and</text>
  <text start="281.38" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;ve been getting stronger and</text>
  <text start="282.88" dur="3.99">stronger and of course on the corporate</text>
  <text start="284.56" dur="5.07">media they continually put out the</text>
  <text start="286.87" dur="4.85">information that everything is being</text>
  <text start="289.63" dur="6.42">demolished and the brick-and-mortar</text>
  <text start="291.72" dur="6.67">sector is imploding because of Amazon so</text>
  <text start="296.05" dur="5.119">in the two decades since Amazon</text>
  <text start="298.39" dur="6.48">streamlined the e-commerce process most</text>
  <text start="301.169" dur="6.31">retailers followed what Amazon did they</text>
  <text start="304.87" dur="5.04">built their online presence and now they</text>
  <text start="307.479" dur="5.401">can sell online in many of the stores</text>
  <text start="309.91" dur="5.129">you have the ability to purchase online</text>
  <text start="312.88" dur="4.89">and go to the store the same day and</text>
  <text start="315.039" dur="5.401">pick it up or you can have it delivered</text>
  <text start="317.77" dur="4.77">for free to the store and we</text>
  <text start="320.44" dur="3.96">for it if you need to wait for it or you</text>
  <text start="322.54" dur="3.06">can deliver it right to your home so</text>
  <text start="324.4" dur="6">they have a little bit of an advantage</text>
  <text start="325.6" dur="7.02">here compared to Amazon and the prices</text>
  <text start="330.4" dur="3.69">aren&amp;#39;t that far off actually when I look</text>
  <text start="332.62" dur="3.99">sometimes Amazon is a little bit more</text>
  <text start="334.09" dur="7.11">expensive than at the brick-and-mortar</text>
  <text start="336.61" dur="7.2">stores so we can see that there is an</text>
  <text start="341.2" dur="5.43">online presence and about 70% of</text>
  <text start="343.81" dur="4.92">Americans about 230 million of them will</text>
  <text start="346.63" dur="4.74">make an online purchase in 2018 and</text>
  <text start="348.73" dur="5.4">sounds like a lot and this will</text>
  <text start="351.37" dur="4.91">contribute about 474 billion to total</text>
  <text start="354.13" dur="6.36">retail sales and this is according to</text>
  <text start="356.28" dur="5.86">statistical marketing outlook now when</text>
  <text start="360.49" dur="6.75">we really look and we break down the</text>
  <text start="362.14" dur="9.15">numbers we see that the retail industry</text>
  <text start="367.24" dur="4.95">is a five trillion dollar industry in</text>
  <text start="371.29" dur="4.44">2017</text>
  <text start="372.19" dur="7.44">and online sales is about four hundred</text>
  <text start="375.73" dur="5.25">and seventy four billion well we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="379.63" dur="2.28">see that one-to-one ratio where</text>
  <text start="380.98" dur="2.7">everyone&amp;#39;s leaving brick-and-mortar</text>
  <text start="381.91" dur="5.04">going to online sales it doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="383.68" dur="7.35">make sense it what this means is is that</text>
  <text start="386.95" dur="4.95">online sales is 10% of all retail sales</text>
  <text start="391.03" dur="4.86">that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="391.9" dur="8.72">10% now people say well in the</text>
  <text start="395.89" dur="7.68">brick-and-mortar sector they include gas</text>
  <text start="400.62" dur="6.61">they include motor vehicle sales</text>
  <text start="403.57" dur="6.45">they include groceries and some other</text>
  <text start="407.23" dur="5.939">categories so you really didn&amp;#39;t count</text>
  <text start="410.02" dur="6.75">that in with this so let&amp;#39;s count that in</text>
  <text start="413.169" dur="7.381">with this and what do we see well if we</text>
  <text start="416.77" dur="7.38">remove all of that and we just look at</text>
  <text start="420.55" dur="7.5">the sales of those items that are online</text>
  <text start="424.15" dur="6.39">online sales makes up around 20% of the</text>
  <text start="428.05" dur="5.79">spending that&amp;#39;s it so the other 80% is</text>
  <text start="430.54" dur="6.45">still brick-and-mortar so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="433.84" dur="5.01">seeing right now is that the retail</text>
  <text start="436.99" dur="3.51">industry is hurting not because of</text>
  <text start="438.85" dur="4.2">online sales not because corporate media</text>
  <text start="440.5" dur="6">keeps on telling you that it&amp;#39;s Amazon</text>
  <text start="443.05" dur="6.51">and Amazon is not the 10% remember</text>
  <text start="446.5" dur="7.659">online sales is 10% Amazon is like 1 or</text>
  <text start="449.56" dur="8.829">1 and a half or 2% of the total sales</text>
  <text start="454.159" dur="6.9">so what they&amp;#39;re telling you doesn&amp;#39;t hold</text>
  <text start="458.389" dur="6.21">water what&amp;#39;s really happening is that</text>
  <text start="461.059" dur="5.67">the everyday person is not purchasing</text>
  <text start="464.599" dur="5.481">like they used to and that brings us</text>
  <text start="466.729" dur="5.52">back to wages jobs and things like that</text>
  <text start="470.08" dur="6.549">what&amp;#39;s been happening is they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="472.249" dur="6.84">manipulating the data the BLS ADP to</text>
  <text start="476.629" dur="4.8">bring the unemployment numbers down and</text>
  <text start="479.089" dur="4.5">this is why we don&amp;#39;t see wages moving up</text>
  <text start="481.429" dur="4.26">because they keep telling us that</text>
  <text start="483.589" dur="4.32">there&amp;#39;s not enough people to fill these</text>
  <text start="485.689" dur="3.72">jobs well if there&amp;#39;s not enough people</text>
  <text start="487.909" dur="3.48">to fill these jobs it&amp;#39;s a supply and</text>
  <text start="489.409" dur="4.68">demand issue and that would mean that</text>
  <text start="491.389" dur="7.02">you would have to pay higher wages to</text>
  <text start="494.089" dur="6.36">get people to attract them but when you</text>
  <text start="498.409" dur="4.11">look at the federal reserve beige book</text>
  <text start="500.449" dur="4.59">you find something else that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="502.519" dur="6.15">interesting because according to the</text>
  <text start="505.039" dur="6.711">beige book wage increases remain modest</text>
  <text start="508.669" dur="5.73">in most districts again which is bizarre</text>
  <text start="511.75" dur="4.659">because of labor shortages they keep</text>
  <text start="514.399" dur="5.31">telling us this just like they told us</text>
  <text start="516.409" dur="5.04">that online sales is taking everything</text>
  <text start="519.709" dur="5.341">away from brick and mortar which is</text>
  <text start="521.449" dur="7.051">again not true what companies are doing</text>
  <text start="525.05" dur="8.269">right now is that they don&amp;#39;t want to pay</text>
  <text start="528.5" dur="9.449">people more money they&amp;#39;re hiring</text>
  <text start="533.319" dur="7.841">low-level individuals and if we have we</text>
  <text start="537.949" dur="4.5">have to go back to what Obama and the</text>
  <text start="541.16" dur="3.81">rest were doing where they were bringing</text>
  <text start="542.449" dur="4.26">in all these illegals they were taking</text>
  <text start="544.97" dur="3.119">up the slack of all these low-paying</text>
  <text start="546.709" dur="4.44">jumps because they were going to bring</text>
  <text start="548.089" dur="5.43">in the TPP where they were going to make</text>
  <text start="551.149" dur="4.92">every single country even and they can</text>
  <text start="553.519" dur="5.43">swap people back and forth and pay them</text>
  <text start="556.069" dur="6.151">very low amounts remember we&amp;#39;re no</text>
  <text start="558.949" dur="5.01">longer a manufacturing country and this</text>
  <text start="562.22" dur="3.84">is going to be a third world nation they</text>
  <text start="563.959" dur="5.25">were ready to set it up as a third world</text>
  <text start="566.06" dur="5.25">nation so employers right now they are</text>
  <text start="569.209" dur="4.951">becoming desperate because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="571.31" dur="6.57">have the amount of illegals in this</text>
  <text start="574.16" dur="7.409">country to pay this low wage so instead</text>
  <text start="577.88" dur="7.04">of paying people a higher wage what are</text>
  <text start="581.569" dur="6.331">they doing well according to this report</text>
  <text start="584.92" dur="6.85">they have been relaxing their</text>
  <text start="587.9" dur="7.32">rules and accepting and hiring convicted</text>
  <text start="591.77" dur="5.25">felons in order to alleviate labor</text>
  <text start="595.22" dur="6.3">shortages actually what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="597.02" dur="8.28">they&amp;#39;re paying them less money to do the</text>
  <text start="601.52" dur="6.99">jobs and they&amp;#39;re basically bypassing</text>
  <text start="605.3" dur="5.7">their drug tests they&amp;#39;re not looking</text>
  <text start="608.51" dur="6.54">into their background now they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="611" dur="8.43">care and they&amp;#39;re paying them a lot less</text>
  <text start="615.05" dur="10.97">money to work in the job now think about</text>
  <text start="619.43" dur="11.28">this for a second employers are hiring</text>
  <text start="626.02" dur="8.08">criminals drug users and anyone else</text>
  <text start="630.71" dur="6.84">they can get their hands on to make sure</text>
  <text start="634.1" dur="10.35">that they don&amp;#39;t have to pay out more</text>
  <text start="637.55" dur="10.2">money to do a job this tells you what is</text>
  <text start="644.45" dur="6.99">happening here this tells you that these</text>
  <text start="647.75" dur="5.49">jobs are very low paying jobs they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="651.44" dur="3.81">not going to increase wages that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="653.24" dur="3.63">we don&amp;#39;t see wages increasing this is</text>
  <text start="655.25" dur="3.93">why they keep when they keep telling you</text>
  <text start="656.87" dur="4.05">that there&amp;#39;s a labor shortage they</text>
  <text start="659.18" dur="4.35">really don&amp;#39;t want qualified people</text>
  <text start="660.92" dur="5.13">because they&amp;#39;re too expensive that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="663.53" dur="5.43">where this country is headed this is not</text>
  <text start="666.05" dur="5.1">what they want and remember the central</text>
  <text start="668.96" dur="4.26">banker is the deep state they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="671.15" dur="4.65">moving straight ahead with what they</text>
  <text start="673.22" dur="4.68">really want and what they really want is</text>
  <text start="675.8" dur="3.96">a one-world government they want to</text>
  <text start="677.9" dur="4.38">blend everything they want a centralized</text>
  <text start="679.76" dur="6.29">system that&amp;#39;s where they&amp;#39;re really going</text>
  <text start="682.28" dur="6.24">and the economy&amp;#39;s not going to improve</text>
  <text start="686.05" dur="4.72">it&amp;#39;s impossible for the economy to</text>
  <text start="688.52" dur="3.84">improve we&amp;#39;ve lost all our manufacturing</text>
  <text start="690.77" dur="4.41">it&amp;#39;s taking years and years and the</text>
  <text start="692.36" dur="3.84">manufacturing is completely gone I mean</text>
  <text start="695.18" dur="2.91">look they just went back and they</text>
  <text start="696.2" dur="3.45">revised the GDP numbers and we know</text>
  <text start="698.09" dur="3.42">these are completely fake phony and</text>
  <text start="699.65" dur="3.9">false because they went back all the way</text>
  <text start="701.51" dur="4.26">down back to the Great Depression they</text>
  <text start="703.55" dur="3.51">had it on you know research and</text>
  <text start="705.77" dur="2.76">development and other things and then</text>

  <text start="708.53" dur="5.52">present day just to get the 2.0 percent</text>
  <text start="711.68" dur="4.98">of the 2.1 percent and then they had to</text>
  <text start="714.05" dur="4.89">manipulate them even further so the</text>
  <text start="716.66" dur="4.71">first quarter GDP came in a 2.3 and</text>
  <text start="718.94" dur="2.7">basically they revised all the numbers</text>
  <text start="721.37" dur="4.59">and</text>
  <text start="721.64" dur="6.17">came in at 2.2 technically 2.17 and the</text>
  <text start="725.96" dur="5.34">economy&amp;#39;s really not going anywhere and</text>
  <text start="727.81" dur="6.97">the problem with GDP with all of this</text>
  <text start="731.3" dur="5.84">70% is what people spend now</text>
  <text start="734.78" dur="5.25">brick-and-mortar is having a problem and</text>

  <text start="752.33" dur="5.96">it&amp;#39;s completely manipulated and if you</text>
  <text start="754.73" dur="6.33">go to shadow stats he uses the older</text>
  <text start="758.29" dur="5.59">calculation and the GDP number is in the</text>
  <text start="761.06" dur="6.09">negative territory and we can see that</text>
  <text start="763.88" dur="5.91">this is the major problem and we know</text>
  <text start="767.15" dur="4.41">that the central banks they realize that</text>
  <text start="769.79" dur="5.19">this economy can&amp;#39;t go any further</text>
  <text start="771.56" dur="5.19">Trump he knows that this economy with</text>
  <text start="774.98" dur="3.93">the Patriots behind him they know that</text>
  <text start="776.75" dur="3.57">this can&amp;#39;t go any further a lot of</text>
  <text start="778.91" dur="3.78">people in his administration he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="780.32" dur="5.07">getting rid of and I believe that the</text>
  <text start="782.69" dur="5.7">next individual who&amp;#39;s moving up on the</text>
  <text start="785.39" dur="4.95">list is going to be minuchin remember</text>
  <text start="788.39" dur="3.6">minuchin was given to him it&amp;#39;s not like</text>

  <text start="791.99" dur="4.32">guy I want just like McMasters just like</text>
  <text start="794.87" dur="5.73">all the other individuals he got rid of</text>
  <text start="796.31" dur="6.57">and it looks like minutia n-- is now</text>
  <text start="800.6" dur="4.59">moving up on the list because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="802.88" dur="4.8">countering everything that Trump is</text>
  <text start="805.19" dur="5.28">doing with China with the ZTE phones</text>
  <text start="807.68" dur="4.59">with tariffs we&amp;#39;re minutia niz saying</text>
  <text start="810.47" dur="2.61">that the trade wars that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="812.27" dur="3.42">put on hold</text>

  <text start="818.66" dur="6.39">telling the corporate media what they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="825.05" dur="6.96">now is Trump and minutia</text>
  <text start="829.37" dur="5.13">they are clashing and eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="832.01" dur="5.37">going to happen is he&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="834.5" dur="5.91">relieved of his duties just like the</text>
  <text start="837.38" dur="4.32">rest or he&amp;#39;ll resign on his own and the</text>
  <text start="840.41" dur="4.62">same thing is going to happen with nikki</text>
  <text start="841.7" dur="6.03">Haley and other individuals and this is</text>
  <text start="845.03" dur="6.9">going to continue on because this is a</text>
  <text start="847.73" dur="6.93">race to crash the economy to gain the</text>
  <text start="851.93" dur="3.58">narrative the economy is dead in the</text>
  <text start="854.66" dur="3.61">water</text>
  <text start="855.51" dur="5.28">and we already see out in Europe there</text>
  <text start="858.27" dur="6.87">are problems and this is going to</text>
  <text start="860.79" dur="6.24">basically have a domino effect and start</text>
  <text start="865.14" dur="5.67">affecting other banks and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="867.03" dur="5.67">end up here in the US and chemic central</text>
  <text start="870.81" dur="4.14">banks can they control the situation of</text>
  <text start="872.7" dur="4.38">course they can for time period for it</text>
  <text start="874.95" dur="2.79">for a time they&amp;#39;ll be able to control</text>
  <text start="877.08" dur="3.03">all of this</text>
  <text start="877.74" dur="4.5">the ECB while they wasted no time</text>
  <text start="880.11" dur="3.96">communicating through unofficial</text>
  <text start="882.24" dur="3.69">channels they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="884.07" dur="3.9">gonna step in for now it&amp;#39;s keeping an</text>
  <text start="885.93" dur="4.08">eye on the Italian bonds but they</text>
  <text start="887.97" dur="4.59">haven&amp;#39;t really plunged all that much yet</text>
  <text start="890.01" dur="5.22">and yields aren&amp;#39;t really that high and</text>
  <text start="892.56" dur="5.28">there are no signs of stress in lending</text>
  <text start="895.23" dur="5.91">between Italian banks and deposits now</text>
  <text start="897.84" dur="6.9">are stable now we know what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="901.14" dur="5.67">saying just like in the year of 2008</text>
  <text start="904.74" dur="5.13">when Ben Bernanke came out and said</text>
  <text start="906.81" dur="4.98">listen everything&amp;#39;s contained housing is</text>
  <text start="909.87" dur="4.95">not gonna fall it&amp;#39;s gonna continually</text>
  <text start="911.79" dur="5.46">rise or stabilize we&amp;#39;re not forecasting</text>
  <text start="914.82" dur="5.73">any type of recession this year so don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="917.25" dur="5.19">worry this is what the ECB is doing</text>
  <text start="920.55" dur="4.49">right now but you know behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="922.44" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re gonna be propping these banks up</text>
  <text start="925.04" dur="5.29">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to contain it and I</text>
  <text start="927.66" dur="4.44">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised in the next couple</text>
  <text start="930.33" dur="4.32">of weeks or a month they come out and</text>
  <text start="932.1" dur="5.36">say this is completely contained now</text>
  <text start="934.65" dur="6.3">that&amp;#39;s the word they like to use and</text>
  <text start="937.46" dur="7.65">they might even let Italy go to</text>
  <text start="940.95" dur="6.9">safeguard the remaining eurozone members</text>
  <text start="945.11" dur="4.84">to try to control the situation so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="947.85" dur="4.56">gonna have to see how they play this all</text>
  <text start="949.95" dur="5.49">out and we see that things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="952.41" dur="5.25">moving forward right now and the system</text>
  <text start="955.44" dur="5.01">is breaking down very very quickly and</text>
  <text start="957.66" dur="5.64">we&amp;#39;re gonna end up in a situation like</text>
  <text start="960.45" dur="5.01">Venezuela where they have hyperinflation</text>
  <text start="963.3" dur="5.49">right now their currency is pretty much</text>
  <text start="965.46" dur="5.58">worthless and if you look at how high</text>
  <text start="968.79" dur="4.65">the inflation has gone which means the</text>
  <text start="971.04" dur="6.2">value of the currency has devalued so</text>
  <text start="973.44" dur="6.48">much it is absolutely ridiculous and</text>
  <text start="977.24" dur="4.93">this is how bad it is they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="979.92" dur="4.38">that inflation is around thirteen</text>
  <text start="982.17" dur="6.99">thousand seven hundred and seventy nine</text>
  <text start="984.3" dur="5.07">percent thirteen thousand so to put this</text>
  <text start="989.16" dur="4.41">in</text>
  <text start="989.37" dur="7.68">to perspective a year ago a cup of</text>
  <text start="993.57" dur="8.519">coffee cost 2,000 Boulevard today it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="997.05" dur="7.41">two hundred thousand Boulevard I mean</text>
  <text start="1002.089" dur="4.381">what does that tell you it tells you</text>
  <text start="1004.46" dur="3.27">that the situation in Venezuela is</text>
  <text start="1006.47" dur="3">getting worse and worse and worse and</text>
  <text start="1007.73" dur="4.47">before you know it these individuals</text>
  <text start="1009.47" dur="4.83">that are going to the supermarket or</text>
  <text start="1012.2" dur="3.78">anywhere else and they bring their cash</text>
  <text start="1014.3" dur="3.87">with them by the time they get there</text>
  <text start="1015.98" dur="6.15">it&amp;#39;s absolutely worthless we saw this in</text>
  <text start="1018.17" dur="5.669">Weimar Germany Argentina and many other</text>
  <text start="1022.13" dur="3.42">countries have had the same exact</text>
  <text start="1023.839" dur="3.181">problem and this is why you need to have</text>
  <text start="1025.55" dur="3.18">gold and silver think about those people</text>
  <text start="1027.02" dur="3.72">that have gold and silver that&amp;#39;s their</text>

  <text start="1047.02" dur="4.36">toilet paper and things like that</text>
  <text start="1048.679" dur="4.951">because y-you can barter those things</text>
  <text start="1051.38" dur="5.76">when things really start to go downhill</text>
  <text start="1053.63" dur="6.54">and we can see that the beginning stages</text>
  <text start="1057.14" dur="5.43">of all this has started and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
