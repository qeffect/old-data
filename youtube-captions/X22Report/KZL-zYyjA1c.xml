  <text start="481.37" dur="4.859">accurate yes that&amp;#39;s right we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="484.31" dur="3.9">found any evidence to substantiate now</text>
  <text start="486.229" dur="4.171">if you noticed he continually avoided</text>
  <text start="488.21" dur="4.56">the questions and some of the questions</text>
  <text start="490.4" dur="4.59">that some of the other individuals that</text>

  <text start="516.649" dur="2.43">the hot seat right now and I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="517.909" dur="5.221">they&amp;#39;re gonna be investigating even</text>
  <text start="519.079" dur="6.481">further and these public testimonies are</text>
  <text start="523.13" dur="5.49">they really public or they scripted and</text>
  <text start="525.56" dur="6.779">these individuals have specific answers</text>
  <text start="528.62" dur="5.61">to these questions and it seems that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="532.339" dur="4.56">the really the way it is because when</text>
  <text start="534.23" dur="3.9">something else is asked and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="536.899" dur="3.111">have the answer to it they just keep</text>
