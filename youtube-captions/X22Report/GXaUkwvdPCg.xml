  <text start="96.54" dur="6.36">privacy is continuing we know the FBI is</text>
  <text start="100.71" dur="4.32">pushing as hard as they possibly can and</text>
  <text start="102.9" dur="3.929">it&amp;#39;s not just here in the US there are</text>
  <text start="105.03" dur="3.449">many countries out there that are doing</text>
  <text start="106.829" dur="4.591">the same exact thing but very</text>
  <text start="108.479" dur="5.491">interesting here in the US where Apple</text>
  <text start="111.42" dur="5.58">is refusing to back down to the FBI /</text>
  <text start="113.97" dur="6.96">encryption amazon on the other hand is</text>
  <text start="117" dur="5.34">doing the opposite there quietly taken</text>
  <text start="120.93" dur="3.869">away the ability to encrypt their</text>
  <text start="122.34" dur="4.889">devices they remove the ability to</text>
  <text start="124.799" dur="6.361">encrypt devices running their fire OS</text>
  <text start="127.229" dur="6.061">operating system now in france which</text>
  <text start="131.16" dur="4.71">i&amp;#39;ve talked about before how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="133.29" dur="5.22">like the poster child of removing the</text>
  <text start="135.87" dur="7.74">rights of the people and we see right</text>
  <text start="138.51" dur="8.009">now that france pushed forward this new</text>
  <text start="143.61" dur="5.43">bill and they&amp;#39;re saying that employees</text>
  <text start="146.519" dur="4.47">of companies and france that refuse to</text>
  <text start="149.04" dur="4.819">decrypt data for police can go to prison</text>
  <text start="150.989" dur="5.551">for five years under new legislation and</text>
  <text start="153.859" dur="4.261">we can see they&amp;#39;re pushing this as hard</text>
  <text start="156.54" dur="4.35">as they possibly can the new proposal</text>
  <text start="158.12" dur="5.59">echoes a bill from january of 2016 that</text>
  <text start="160.89" dur="6.36">would basically mandate</text>
  <text start="163.71" dur="7.5">doors into encryption in France so they</text>
  <text start="167.25" dur="5.46">want backdoors into everything and if</text>
  <text start="171.21" dur="5.25">you don&amp;#39;t allow the government to do</text>
  <text start="172.71" dur="6.39">this guess what you can go to jail you</text>
  <text start="176.46" dur="6.54">can be fined actually you can spend five</text>
  <text start="179.1" dur="5.49">years in prison and your fine would be</text>
  <text start="183" dur="9.14">three hundred and eighty thousand</text>
  <text start="184.59" dur="11.79">dollars these are juco nian laws forcing</text>
  <text start="192.14" dur="6.52">people companies to do what the</text>
  <text start="196.38" dur="5.91">government&amp;#39;s want they want information</text>
  <text start="198.66" dur="7.73">on the public they want to know what</text>
  <text start="202.29" dur="7.32">everyone is doing the question is why</text>
  <text start="206.39" dur="5.05">why do they need to know this because</text>
  <text start="209.61" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re nervous they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re afraid</text>
  <text start="211.44" dur="6.15">of the population in each one of their</text>
  <text start="213.69" dur="8.19">countries they&amp;#39;re afraid that they might</text>
  <text start="217.59" dur="6.06">rise up and say enough is enough we</text>
  <text start="221.88" dur="4.8">can&amp;#39;t take this has happened many many</text>
  <text start="223.65" dur="5.64">times in history and this is what</text>
  <text start="226.68" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re very nervous about in the US</text>
  <text start="229.29" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re trying to basically remove the</text>
  <text start="232.14" dur="4.02">weapons from the people they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="234.3" dur="5.19">to spy on every single person so they</text>
  <text start="236.16" dur="6.15">know who is anti-government we talked</text>
  <text start="239.49" dur="4.95">about this new truth system that the FBI</text>
  <text start="242.31" dur="4.53">is putting into place where they going</text>
  <text start="244.44" dur="6.12">to monitor all these website guess what</text>
  <text start="246.84" dur="6.36">France already has it we see many other</text>
  <text start="250.56" dur="4.98">countries that are doing the same thing</text>
  <text start="253.2" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re chipping away at everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="255.54" dur="5.82">rights a little by little the system is</text>
  <text start="258.72" dur="5.79">falling apart and at the end of the</text>
  <text start="261.36" dur="5.43">system where it completely implodes on</text>
  <text start="264.51" dur="5.52">itself governments go to extreme</text>
  <text start="266.79" dur="6.57">measures to control the entire situation</text>
  <text start="270.03" dur="6">and of course it&amp;#39;s the way they want to</text>
  <text start="273.36" dur="5.94">control it and that means you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="276.03" dur="6.42">your rights you don&amp;#39;t have choices you</text>
  <text start="279.3" dur="4.71">don&amp;#39;t have the freedom to speak out they</text>
  <text start="282.45" dur="4.05">want that gun because they want to keep</text>
  <text start="284.01" dur="4.65">that power they have they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="286.5" dur="4.92">remove that power and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="288.66" dur="4.74">continually pushing and pushing until</text>
  <text start="291.42" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;ll move they&amp;#39;ll basically remove</text>
  <text start="293.4" dur="7.91">all rights now we know that the US</text>
  <text start="297.6" dur="6.74">sanctions on North Korea North Korea has</text>
  <text start="301.31" dur="6.73">reported shot missiles into the water</text>
  <text start="304.34" dur="5.74">which is absolutely meaningless north</text>
  <text start="308.04" dur="4.95">Korea has rejected the UN Security</text>
  <text start="310.08" dur="4.53">Council resolution on sanctions and of</text>
  <text start="312.99" dur="6.75">course we&amp;#39;re hearing a lot of propaganda</text>
  <text start="314.61" dur="7.17">that north korea kim jong hoon get the</text>
  <text start="319.74" dur="4.26">military ready to use nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="321.78" dur="4.47">now we know this is complete propaganda</text>
  <text start="324" dur="3.27">we know the u.s. is pushing this</text>
  <text start="326.25" dur="5.04">actually we don&amp;#39;t even know if this</text>
  <text start="327.27" dur="7.55">really came from North Korea but this is</text>
  <text start="331.29" dur="6.81">all out there and it&amp;#39;s done on purpose</text>
  <text start="334.82" dur="5.02">to basically push the agenda of the</text>
  <text start="338.1" dur="4.11">private wasn&amp;#39;t central bank countries</text>
  <text start="339.84" dur="4.59">because as soon as this happens talks</text>
  <text start="342.21" dur="5.52">between South Korea and the u.s. started</text>
  <text start="344.43" dur="4.8">up again about the fad deployment that</text>
  <text start="347.73" dur="3.3">is the terminal high-altitude air</text>
  <text start="349.23" dur="4.44">defense system they want this</text>
  <text start="351.03" dur="5.46">implemented in South Korea not just for</text>
  <text start="353.67" dur="7.08">North Korea but for China so those talks</text>
  <text start="356.49" dur="8.6">are back on and the White House is out</text>
  <text start="360.75" dur="7.77">there continually provoking and pushing</text>
  <text start="365.09" dur="5.8">North Korea the United States is warning</text>
  <text start="368.52" dur="7.55">North Korea at this point to refrain</text>
  <text start="370.89" dur="7.44">from any further provocation or actions</text>
  <text start="376.07" dur="5.77">basically what we&amp;#39;ve talked about in the</text>
  <text start="378.33" dur="5.61">past about bullying about poking that</text>
  <text start="381.84" dur="7.53">kid in the hole we&amp;#39;re seeing the same</text>
  <text start="383.94" dur="8.22">thing happen once again the US wants one</text>
  <text start="389.37" dur="8.73">of these countries to do something to</text>
  <text start="392.16" dur="9.45">lash out and as soon as they do war will</text>
  <text start="398.1" dur="5.96">begin and this is what they&amp;#39;re doing and</text>
  <text start="401.61" dur="6.99">it will accelerate as we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="404.06" dur="6.57">throughout this year now Moscow is out</text>
  <text start="408.6" dur="5.4">there and they&amp;#39;re telling Ukraine</text>
  <text start="410.63" dur="5.86">specifically Kiev to speed up the</text>
  <text start="414" dur="4.68">implementation of the mint to package</text>
  <text start="416.49" dur="4.32">because they&amp;#39;re noticing Kiev is</text>
  <text start="418.68" dur="5.85">dragging their feet it&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="420.81" dur="5.9">southeastern people but it&amp;#39;s Kiev and in</text>
  <text start="424.53" dur="6.63">the corporate media today I see that</text>
  <text start="426.71" dur="7.54">France Germany they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="431.16" dur="5.51">the Mint&amp;#39;s to cease fire forward but I</text>
  <text start="434.25" dur="6.44">noticed they don&amp;#39;t mention that Kiev is</text>
  <text start="436.67" dur="6.48">the area where things are not moving and</text>
  <text start="440.69" dur="6.85">in the corporate media today they said</text>
  <text start="443.15" dur="7.15">okay yes they&amp;#39;ve agreed on a consensus</text>
  <text start="447.54" dur="5.07">that there will be poles coming up very</text>
  <text start="450.3" dur="3.81">soon maybe in July where the</text>
  <text start="452.61" dur="3.66">southeastern people are going to vote</text>
  <text start="454.11" dur="3.24">well they said this many times in 2015</text>
  <text start="456.27" dur="4.17">actually was supposed to be the end of</text>
  <text start="457.35" dur="5.16">2015 but Russian Foreign Minister Sergey</text>
  <text start="460.44" dur="5.1">Lavrov came out and says no there was no</text>
  <text start="462.51" dur="5.9">consensus consensus whatsoever nobody</text>
  <text start="465.54" dur="6.9">reached anything of the timing of poles</text>
  <text start="468.41" dur="9.18">they pushed they wanted a consensus by</text>
  <text start="472.44" dur="10.65">July but guess what Kiev not cooperating</text>
  <text start="477.59" dur="7.36">whatsoever they opposed the demand so we</text>
  <text start="483.09" dur="8.16">can see what&amp;#39;s really happening at this</text>
  <text start="484.95" dur="11.25">point now the US navy they have deployed</text>
  <text start="491.25" dur="7.86">a small armata headed by the USS Stennis</text>
  <text start="496.2" dur="7.02">to South China to the South China Sea</text>
  <text start="499.11" dur="6.21">and they&amp;#39;re going to provoke china by</text>
  <text start="503.22" dur="4.89">sailing around there so we have the john</text>
  <text start="505.32" dur="6.39">c Stennis two destroyers two cruisers</text>
  <text start="508.11" dur="6.63">and a Jap man japan-based u.s. 7th fleet</text>
  <text start="511.71" dur="5.18">flagship and they&amp;#39;ve sailed into the</text>
  <text start="514.74" dur="8.729">contested waters of the South China Sea</text>
  <text start="516.89" dur="10.09">to push China into doing more provoking</text>
  <text start="523.469" dur="6.421">China so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="526.98" dur="6.3">the u.s. is provoking China in the</text>
  <text start="529.89" dur="5.67">Pacific and as we can see that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="533.28" dur="5.28">accelerating we see the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="535.56" dur="5.94">provoking North Korea and that is</text>
  <text start="538.56" dur="6.9">accelerating we see Obama out there</text>
  <text start="541.5" dur="7.02">telling Moscow a specifically Putin to</text>
  <text start="545.46" dur="5.43">finish up and implement the Mint&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="548.52" dur="6.15">cease fire now think about what Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="550.89" dur="7.86">saying for a minute in Ukraine Putin</text>
  <text start="554.67" dur="6.54">can&amp;#39;t complete anything because it rests</text>
  <text start="558.75" dur="5.79">with Kiev now the United States knows</text>
  <text start="561.21" dur="5.21">this and this is why this is an</text>
  <text start="564.54" dur="4.919">impossibility</text>
  <text start="566.42" dur="5.5">but they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re pushing and letting</text>
  <text start="569.459" dur="5.451">the world know especially the people</text>
  <text start="571.92" dur="7.74">here in the US that it&amp;#39;s Russia&amp;#39;s fault</text>
  <text start="574.91" dur="7.51">but Kiev oppose the demand so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="579.66" dur="4.619">nowhere to go at this point and the</text>
  <text start="582.42" dur="3.81">reason there&amp;#39;s no place to go it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="584.279" dur="5.61">because they do not want the Mint&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="586.23" dur="6.63">cease fire completed this is why ukraine</text>
  <text start="589.889" dur="6.271">right now is going to start up military</text>
  <text start="592.86" dur="5.58">drills massive military drills in this</text>
  <text start="596.16" dur="5.22">area very interesting we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="598.44" dur="5.79">military drills all over the world right</text>
  <text start="601.38" dur="6.48">now and we know what a military drill is</text>
  <text start="604.23" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s a rehearsal for war and this is</text>
  <text start="607.86" dur="2.82">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="609.18" dur="4.709">more military as has moved into these</text>
  <text start="610.68" dur="7.639">positions more troops being sent over</text>
  <text start="613.889" dur="9.331">and more drills because basically</text>
  <text start="618.319" dur="9.431">they&amp;#39;re getting ready for a major war in</text>
  <text start="623.22" dur="8.099">all of these areas now out in Libya Rome</text>
  <text start="627.75" dur="5.37">is going to assume a leading role in the</text>
  <text start="631.319" dur="4.981">international fight against the Islamic</text>
  <text start="633.12" dur="5.43">state which we know this is not what</text>
  <text start="636.3" dur="4.529">it&amp;#39;s all about because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="638.55" dur="3.479">starting to see out in Libya and this</text>
  <text start="640.829" dur="4.161">has been happening for quite a while</text>
  <text start="642.029" dur="7.531">we&amp;#39;re starting to see troops trickle in</text>
  <text start="644.99" dur="6.61">to this area and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="649.56" dur="4.95">Italy is saying listen we&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="651.6" dur="5.19">to go to war unless there&amp;#39;s a unity</text>
  <text start="654.51" dur="4.079">government we will not bring in troops</text>
  <text start="656.79" dur="3.81">until this unity government and we said</text>
  <text start="658.589" dur="4.411">this before they&amp;#39;re waiting for the</text>
  <text start="660.6" dur="4.32">unity government to be put in place so</text>
  <text start="663" dur="5.76">they can say the new government invited</text>
  <text start="664.92" dur="9.24">everyone in but the number of troops</text>
  <text start="668.76" dur="9.139">assets are increasing because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="674.16" dur="7.679">preparing for this invasion of Libya and</text>
  <text start="677.899" dur="6.101">we see right now that this secret war</text>
  <text start="681.839" dur="6.721">that they have going on is going to</text>
  <text start="684" dur="6.6">become very public very soon the Syrian</text>
  <text start="688.56" dur="4.259">Air Force they&amp;#39;ve launched their first</text>
  <text start="690.6" dur="4.65">strikes at Tara&amp;#39;s position since the</text>
  <text start="692.819" dur="5.671">truce we see Russia is continually</text>
  <text start="695.25" dur="5.399">bombing and we&amp;#39;re seeing problems with</text>
  <text start="698.49" dur="3.659">the ceasefire because the Syrian</text>
  <text start="700.649" dur="2.821">opposition is continuing saying there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="702.149" dur="4.831">all these violations but we have to</text>
  <text start="703.47" dur="5.22">remember that Syria Russia they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="706.98" dur="5.43">going after the Islamic state al-nusrah</text>
  <text start="708.69" dur="5.73">al-qaeda and of course when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="712.41" dur="6.45">hitting and attacking these different</text>
  <text start="714.42" dur="6.75">areas as they meld with the Free Syrian</text>
  <text start="718.86" dur="4.74">Army we know there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>

  <text start="741.12" dur="4.26">ninth they were march seven they were</text>
  <text start="742.56" dur="4.71">march first and now we see that this</text>
  <text start="745.38" dur="5.01">date might not hold right now because</text>
  <text start="747.27" dur="6.05">the Syrian opposition has doubts at this</text>
  <text start="750.39" dur="7.29">point about moving forward with this and</text>
  <text start="753.32" dur="7.03">we see at this point that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="757.68" dur="6.23">want these talks to go forward they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="760.35" dur="6.57">moving military assets into position</text>
  <text start="763.91" dur="5.38">we&amp;#39;ve seen Lebanon with the warning</text>
  <text start="766.92" dur="7.08">diplomats being removed we see Jordan</text>
  <text start="769.29" dur="7.59">getting attack helicopters we see</text>

  <text start="795.589" dur="5.891">camped out on the border in Syria right</text>
  <text start="799.35" dur="4.59">next to Turkey so they can continually</text>
  <text start="801.48" dur="7.91">supply them with weapons and</text>
  <text start="803.94" dur="8.97">humanitarian aid now out in Spain we see</text>
  <text start="809.39" dur="10.86">there were 20,000 military uniforms</text>
  <text start="812.91" dur="12.21">hidden inside an aid package for Syria</text>
  <text start="820.25" dur="6.94">now we know what is going on here we</text>
  <text start="825.12" dur="4.5">know that this is part of the operation</text>
  <text start="827.19" dur="4.8">because they&amp;#39;re bringing in more of</text>

  <text start="834.6" dur="6.6">basically supplying them with everything</text>
  <text start="836.82" dur="6.959">they need and at this point we see that</text>
  <text start="841.2" dur="4.8">these uniforms were meant for al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="843.779" dur="6.661">they were meant for the Islamic state in</text>
  <text start="846" dur="8.07">Syria and Iraq and they arrested five</text>
  <text start="850.44" dur="8.49">Spanish nationals a jordanian a Moroccan</text>
  <text start="854.07" dur="6.99">and to Syrians and we can see this was</text>
  <text start="858.93" dur="6.42">part of their operation now all these</text>
  <text start="861.06" dur="8.16">different types of weapons aid assets</text>
  <text start="865.35" dur="8.04">are all being brought in to resupply the</text>
  <text start="869.22" dur="6.72">terrorists in Syria because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="873.39" dur="4.68">taking this time right now because they</text>
  <text start="875.94" dur="3.93">know Russia Syria stop the bombing for a</text>
  <text start="878.07" dur="4.019">little while they know they have the</text>
  <text start="879.87" dur="4.77">ability to send in humanitarian aid to</text>
  <text start="882.089" dur="5.401">resupply the different terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="884.64" dur="7.139">and they&amp;#39;re doing this at this point now</text>
  <text start="887.49" dur="8.4">the US and Israel they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="891.779" dur="6.241">pushing the propaganda that Syria the</text>
  <text start="895.89" dur="5.43">Syrian government is using chemical</text>
  <text start="898.02" dur="5.58">weapons still during the truce Israeli</text>

  <text start="905.13" dur="6.899">chemical weapons against civilians since</text>
  <text start="907.529" dur="6.3">the start of the ceasefire now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="912.029" dur="3.511">saying that they not using chemical</text>
  <text start="913.829" dur="4.95">weapons but they&amp;#39;re using of course the</text>
  <text start="915.54" dur="7.32">chlorine weapons and other types of</text>

  <text start="922.86" dur="11.31">helicopters using barrels now we know</text>
  <text start="930.329" dur="6.661">this is all propaganda once again we</text>
  <text start="934.17" dur="4.71">know that the terrorists have been using</text>
  <text start="936.99" dur="5.31">chlorine we know the terrorists have</text>
  <text start="938.88" dur="5.16">been using mustard gas and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="942.3" dur="5.37">trying to make the case that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="944.04" dur="6.419">doing this to their own civilians and I</text>
  <text start="947.67" dur="5.55">know everyone&amp;#39;s like well no yes this</text>
  <text start="950.459" dur="4.891">leader is doing it well they&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="953.22" dur="5.22">shown the proof yes they&amp;#39;ve shown</text>
  <text start="955.35" dur="6.179">pictures of people in hospitals but</text>
  <text start="958.44" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s not proof that&amp;#39;s the aftermath of</text>
  <text start="961.529" dur="4.321">what has happened now we don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="963.63" dur="4.62">it was the terrorist organization</text>
  <text start="965.85" dur="4.679">or the government all we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="968.25" dur="5.16">people in the hospital I&amp;#39;ll use the</text>
  <text start="970.529" dur="5.901">example again if you&amp;#39;re in a court trial</text>
  <text start="973.41" dur="7.46">and you show a picture of a dead person</text>
  <text start="976.43" dur="9.099">that&amp;#39;s not proof that&amp;#39;s what happened</text>
  <text start="980.87" dur="6.219">you need to have the link because the US</text>
  <text start="985.529" dur="5.31">government likes to play this trick a</text>
  <text start="987.089" dur="6.031">lot let&amp;#39;s bring photos to Congress look</text>
  <text start="990.839" dur="6.451">at all the poor people look at everyone</text>
  <text start="993.12" dur="5.399">suffering well who did this well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="997.29" dur="4.56">gonna point to that person right over</text>
  <text start="998.519" dur="4.231">there well do you have the proof we have</text>
  <text start="1001.85" dur="2.46">the proof right here look at the</text>
  <text start="1002.75" dur="3.75">pictures no no that&amp;#39;s not the proof</text>
  <text start="1004.31" dur="4.709">that&amp;#39;s the aftermath where&amp;#39;s the link</text>
  <text start="1006.5" dur="5.04">and this is where it always falls short</text>
  <text start="1009.019" dur="7.141">this is what they can&amp;#39;t do they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1011.54" dur="7.289">link it because it makes no sense for a</text>
  <text start="1016.16" dur="7.889">leader at this point who&amp;#39;s fighting for</text>
  <text start="1018.829" dur="7.74">the country to basically kill and hurt</text>
  <text start="1024.049" dur="4.5">their own people it&amp;#39;s like the founding</text>
  <text start="1026.569" dur="3.961">fathers of the United States who are</text>
  <text start="1028.549" dur="4.921">fighting for this country to turn around</text>
  <text start="1030.53" dur="6.629">and shoot the cannons at the people it</text>
  <text start="1033.47" dur="10.079">makes no sense so the argument doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1037.159" dur="9.63">hold water and actually with proof we</text>
  <text start="1043.549" dur="7.021">see that no it was the Islamic state no</text>
  <text start="1046.789" dur="6.061">it was the Free Syrian Army that were</text>
  <text start="1050.57" dur="5.729">hurting the people in these areas</text>
  <text start="1052.85" dur="6.62">actually MIT did an experiment back in</text>
  <text start="1056.299" dur="6.12">2013 when they showed the probably</text>
  <text start="1059.47" dur="5.079">projectile of the sarin gas missile that</text>
  <text start="1062.419" dur="4.531">they used they said it was impossible</text>
  <text start="1064.549" dur="4.021">for that missile to come from the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1066.95" dur="3.66">government it actually came from the</text>
  <text start="1068.57" dur="5.13">Free Syrian Army then they found the</text>
  <text start="1070.61" dur="6.059">sarin gas in the caves of the Free</text>
  <text start="1073.7" dur="4.709">Syrian Army and then we find out that</text>
  <text start="1076.669" dur="5.49">yes the Islamic state the Free Syrian</text>
  <text start="1078.409" dur="6.781">Army they were all using sarin gas so</text>
  <text start="1082.159" dur="7.02">this is how the propaganda is used to</text>
  <text start="1085.19" dur="6.18">convince everyone so we see the Senate</text>
  <text start="1089.179" dur="4.831">for Foreign Relations Committee Murphy</text>
  <text start="1091.37" dur="5.52">who&amp;#39;s out there saying that elections in</text>
  <text start="1094.01" dur="5.82">Syria are important but security is more</text>
  <text start="1096.89" dur="6.81">important and he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="1099.83" dur="8.52">we cannot have elections unless their</text>
  <text start="1103.7" dur="8.43">security on the ground in Syria that</text>
  <text start="1108.35" dur="8.52">means they want control of Syria before</text>
  <text start="1112.13" dur="11.19">the elections and then we have Mark</text>
  <text start="1116.87" dur="8.88">Toner out there saying listen if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1123.32" dur="5.76">going to have elections then we need to</text>
  <text start="1125.75" dur="7.95">have all Syrians around the world vote</text>
  <text start="1129.08" dur="6.51">in these elections and we don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="1133.7" dur="4.68">look at their passports they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1135.59" dur="5.37">to prove that they&amp;#39;re Syrians will just</text>
  <text start="1138.38" dur="5.669">take their word for it well don&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="1140.96" dur="6.42">do that here in the US where they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1144.049" dur="5.701">look at ids they don&amp;#39;t look at anyone</text>
  <text start="1147.38" dur="4.649">they don&amp;#39;t have any checks and balances</text>
  <text start="1149.75" dur="6.75">is that voter fraud that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1152.029" dur="8.461">seeing and we can see this is what they</text>
  <text start="1156.5" dur="6.539">want to do they want to take people</text>
  <text start="1160.49" dur="4.35">outside of the country get them together</text>
  <text start="1163.039" dur="5.311">actually they&amp;#39;re proud won&amp;#39;t even be</text>
  <text start="1164.84" dur="7.85">people will just send in ballots to show</text>
  <text start="1168.35" dur="8.09">that we don&amp;#39;t want Assad as president</text>
  <text start="1172.69" dur="9.099">they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="1176.44" dur="8.32">to basically take what is happening</text>
  <text start="1181.789" dur="8.73">right now and remove Assad that&amp;#39;s their</text>
  <text start="1184.76" dur="8.669">goal it has always been their goal so we</text>
  <text start="1190.519" dur="4.711">have the Geneva talks that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1193.429" dur="5.281">trying to put together we&amp;#39;ve had them</text>
  <text start="1195.23" dur="6.27">before their agenda was remove Assad</text>
  <text start="1198.71" dur="5.37">remove Assad oh and remove Assad so the</text>
  <text start="1201.5" dur="4.5">new Geneva talks they&amp;#39;re saying we</text>
  <text start="1204.08" dur="5.04">should really focus on the power of</text>
  <text start="1206" dur="5.7">transition in Syria where we have the</text>
  <text start="1209.12" dur="8.13">removal of Assad so what has changed</text>
  <text start="1211.7" dur="7.02">here absolutely nothing now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1217.25" dur="3.24">interesting about all of this that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1218.72" dur="3.689">going on right now we have the ceasefire</text>
  <text start="1220.49" dur="3.51">where the US and the Russia they got</text>
  <text start="1222.409" dur="5.311">together they hammered out this</text>
  <text start="1224" dur="7.8">ceasefire deal and we&amp;#39;re seeing more and</text>
  <text start="1227.72" dur="8.55">more military assets and troops</text>
  <text start="1231.8" dur="8.94">moved into the area to fight the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1236.27" dur="8.84">state and to go into Syria now before</text>
  <text start="1240.74" dur="6.51">the ceasefire and the peace negotiations</text>
  <text start="1245.11" dur="4.66">none of the country&amp;#39;s wanted to get</text>
  <text start="1247.25" dur="3.69">involved but then we have ashton carter</text>
  <text start="1249.77" dur="4.65">who went around to all the different</text>
  <text start="1250.94" dur="6.33">countries and said listen we need troops</text>
  <text start="1254.42" dur="7.29">we need military assets and we see Italy</text>
  <text start="1257.27" dur="7.4">get involved UK bringing in troops we</text>

  <text start="1271.07" dur="9.9">into Syria they will be sending 400</text>
  <text start="1275.33" dur="9.24">special forces into the area now this is</text>
  <text start="1280.97" dur="7.74">very odd at this point in time because</text>
  <text start="1284.57" dur="5.91">Russia and Assad have not invited any of</text>
  <text start="1288.71" dur="3.99">these countries into Syria to fight the</text>
  <text start="1290.48" dur="7.76">Islamic state they&amp;#39;re handling it fine</text>
  <text start="1292.7" dur="8.64">on their own there&amp;#39;s a ceasefire now and</text>
  <text start="1298.24" dur="6.73">there&amp;#39;s no reason for all of this to be</text>
  <text start="1301.34" dur="7.71">happening at this point unless they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1304.97" dur="6.03">planning for a major offensive in the</text>
  <text start="1309.05" dur="5.28">Middle East and this is what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1311" dur="6.18">right now because Ashton Carter went</text>
  <text start="1314.33" dur="8.4">around recruiting the other countries</text>
  <text start="1317.18" dur="8.25">saying listen we need your personnel we</text>
  <text start="1322.73" dur="4.02">need your weaponry because they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1325.43" dur="3.24">get the authorization for war in the</text>
  <text start="1326.75" dur="4.05">United States past here so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1328.67" dur="4.79">certain limits at this point so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1330.8" dur="6.98">going to depend on Saudi Arabia Qatar</text>
  <text start="1333.46" dur="10.93">United Arab Emirates Jordan Egypt Italy</text>
  <text start="1337.78" dur="10.78">Spain Australia UK Denmark Norway and</text>
  <text start="1344.39" dur="9.14">the rest to bring in their military</text>
