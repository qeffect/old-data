  <text start="62.68" dur="5.79">October 9th 2018 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="65.26" dur="7.38">episode is confirmed contradict the Fed</text>
  <text start="68.47" dur="5.97">economy collapse blame the Fed let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="72.64" dur="4.29">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="74.44" dur="4.65">news now we&amp;#39;ve been getting warnings all</text>
  <text start="76.93" dur="4.67">over the place and we need to think back</text>
  <text start="79.09" dur="5.31">and think about why they are warning</text>
  <text start="81.6" dur="5.08">everyone I mean when Obama was president</text>
  <text start="84.4" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;re going through this recovery no</text>
  <text start="86.68" dur="4.23">warnings the economy was doing great it</text>
  <text start="88.33" dur="4.11">was recovering and those numbers those</text>
  <text start="90.91" dur="4.05">statistical numbers that they manipulate</text>
  <text start="92.44" dur="5.25">they weren&amp;#39;t that great Trump comes into</text>
  <text start="94.96" dur="5.19">the presidency manipulates the numbers</text>
  <text start="97.69" dur="5.22">even more using their methods makes the</text>
  <text start="100.15" dur="4.26">economy look incredible now we have</text>
  <text start="102.91" dur="4.35">warnings all over the place the housing</text>
  <text start="104.41" dur="4.8">markets coming down the global debt is</text>
  <text start="107.26" dur="4.2">too high the interest rates are being</text>
  <text start="109.21" dur="5.07">raised and Trump came out and</text>
  <text start="111.46" dur="6">contradicted the Fed and he did this</text>
  <text start="114.28" dur="5.58">twice saying that he thought that Powell</text>
  <text start="117.46" dur="4.71">was an easy money Fed not an interest</text>
  <text start="119.86" dur="4.47">rate fed and then the second time said</text>
  <text start="122.17" dur="4.41">listen raising the interest rate right</text>
  <text start="124.33" dur="4.47">now is not going to help because we have</text>
  <text start="126.58" dur="5.37">to pay off the debt this is not going to</text>
  <text start="128.8" dur="7.38">help the situation and we know that</text>
  <text start="131.95" dur="6.72">Trump is going to contradict the Fed</text>
  <text start="136.18" dur="6.45">again because they just raised their</text>
  <text start="138.67" dur="8.18">rates and right on cue this is exactly</text>
  <text start="142.63" dur="8.579">what he did now let&amp;#39;s think about this</text>
  <text start="146.85" dur="8.25">what is the plan here the entire plan</text>
  <text start="151.209" dur="6.211">was to delay the collapse of the system</text>
  <text start="155.1" dur="5.68">now why would he have to delay the</text>
  <text start="157.42" dur="5.31">collapse well he became president and he</text>
  <text start="160.78" dur="4.11">needed to reverse everything needed to</text>
  <text start="162.73" dur="4.59">get rid of TPP needed to get rid of</text>
  <text start="164.89" dur="3.42">NAFTA or renegotiate NAFTA because it</text>
  <text start="167.32" dur="3.44">was very difficult to get rid of because</text>
  <text start="168.31" dur="7.14">he had to go through the Congress</text>
  <text start="170.76" dur="7.84">dismantle the globalist system and start</text>
  <text start="175.45" dur="6.5">to reorganize everything now how do you</text>
  <text start="178.6" dur="6.72">delay all of this well you give tax cuts</text>
  <text start="181.95" dur="5.58">this will delay the inevitable because</text>
  <text start="185.32" dur="3.86">it gives disposable income back to the</text>
  <text start="187.53" dur="4.32">people it allows corporations to</text>
  <text start="189.18" dur="6.69">continue on and it gives you this buffer</text>
  <text start="191.85" dur="6.09">area but that buffer area will only last</text>
  <text start="195.87" dur="4.41">a certain period of time and then the</text>
  <text start="197.94" dur="4.47">economy will continue in its downward</text>
  <text start="200.28" dur="4.53">slide remember we&amp;#39;ve been following the</text>
  <text start="202.41" dur="3.69">economy for a very long time and we know</text>
  <text start="204.81" dur="4.11">what&amp;#39;s going to happen we&amp;#39;ve seen it</text>
  <text start="206.1" dur="5.19">time and time again the Fed raises the</text>
  <text start="208.92" dur="4.5">rates and the system implodes that it</text>
  <text start="211.29" dur="5.279">get the debt gets too high you go</text>
  <text start="213.42" dur="6.42">bankrupt I mean it&amp;#39;s a very simple thing</text>
  <text start="216.569" dur="6.89">to understand here so right now we are</text>
  <text start="219.84" dur="6">in the delay phase of the economy why</text>
  <text start="223.459" dur="5.351">because the plan is to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="225.84" dur="6.929">globalist system bring back</text>
  <text start="228.81" dur="6.06">manufacturing bring back everything that</text>
  <text start="232.769" dur="5.701">was taken away can we bring back</text>
  <text start="234.87" dur="7.14">everything most likely not but we can do</text>
  <text start="238.47" dur="6.75">it to a point where at least the US will</text>
  <text start="242.01" dur="7.53">be prepared for this transition and</text>
  <text start="245.22" dur="6.9">that&amp;#39;s where we are right now and we can</text>
  <text start="249.54" dur="4.949">see that global liquidity it&amp;#39;s rapidly</text>
  <text start="252.12" dur="4.92">shrinking right now because each central</text>
  <text start="254.489" dur="3.981">bank they are tightening and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="257.04" dur="3.84">gonna start raising rates a little bit</text>
  <text start="258.47" dur="4.12">because the central banks believed and</text>
  <text start="260.88" dur="3.42">they thought that there was going to be</text>
  <text start="262.59" dur="2.73">someone else in the White House and they</text>
  <text start="264.3" dur="5.489">thought they were going to use an event</text>
  <text start="265.32" dur="6.78">to cover up their entire crash of the</text>
  <text start="269.789" dur="5.761">global system well that didn&amp;#39;t work out</text>
  <text start="272.1" dur="6.6">if you notice the IMF the biz they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="275.55" dur="7.56">all out there blaming Trump&amp;#39;s policy the</text>
  <text start="278.7" dur="8.969">trade war between the US and China and</text>
  <text start="283.11" dur="6.36">they continually do this but when you</text>
  <text start="287.669" dur="3.12">look at the situation and this is why</text>
  <text start="289.47" dur="3.18">we&amp;#39;ve been following the economy for</text>
  <text start="290.789" dur="3.271">such a long time we know that the</text>
  <text start="292.65" dur="4.62">economy was breaking down for a</text>
  <text start="294.06" dur="6.99">completely different reason and the</text>
  <text start="297.27" dur="6.39">purpose of the trade war was not to</text>
  <text start="301.05" dur="7.34">bring down the economy because of the</text>
  <text start="303.66" dur="8.61">trade war it was to set up a system</text>
  <text start="308.39" dur="7.269">where manufacturing can be brought back</text>
  <text start="312.27" dur="5.67">to the United States and tariffs the</text>
  <text start="315.659" dur="4.801">cost of exporting and importing can be</text>
  <text start="317.94" dur="3.6">leveled out where you have an even</text>
  <text start="320.46" dur="2.64">playing field</text>
  <text start="321.54" dur="4.77">amongst the countries because remember</text>
  <text start="323.1" dur="6.69">the globalist system did not help the</text>
  <text start="326.31" dur="5.01">u.s. that wasn&amp;#39;t their plan their plan</text>
  <text start="329.79" dur="4.07">was to make the u.s. a third world</text>
  <text start="331.32" dur="8.01">nation that&amp;#39;s not happening right now</text>
  <text start="333.86" dur="5.92">now we know that China they are in on</text>
  <text start="339.33" dur="3.3">this</text>
  <text start="339.78" dur="5.79">Russia is in on this and as Trump</text>
  <text start="342.63" dur="5.37">continually makes these bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="345.57" dur="4.32">agreements puts tariffs on China try to</text>
  <text start="348" dur="5.01">bring as much manufacturing back to the</text>
  <text start="349.89" dur="5.85">states reduces regulations he&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="353.01" dur="4.53">doing all of this to bring the companies</text>
  <text start="355.74" dur="5.16">back to the US this is why he&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="357.54" dur="5.7">to make all these deals China they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="360.9" dur="6.2">eventually going to help crash the</text>
  <text start="363.24" dur="7.32">system think about what China has a huge</text>
  <text start="367.1" dur="5.32">amount of Treasuries and China has</text>
  <text start="370.56" dur="4.26">already been saying that listen if this</text>
  <text start="372.42" dur="4.08">continues we&amp;#39;re just gonna sell off all</text>
  <text start="374.82" dur="3.93">our Treasuries what happens if they sell</text>
  <text start="376.5" dur="3.99">off all their Treasuries yes the Fed can</text>
  <text start="378.75" dur="4.05">purchase them yes</text>
  <text start="380.49" dur="5.58">maybe&amp;#39;s pension funds can purchase them</text>
  <text start="382.8" dur="5.76">but it&amp;#39;s going to be completely</text>
  <text start="386.07" dur="4.77">disastrous if this happens but this is</text>
  <text start="388.56" dur="5.52">not going to happen as of yet because we</text>
  <text start="390.84" dur="5.81">know that China has been propping up</text>
  <text start="394.08" dur="6.42">their system buying a lot of gold and</text>
  <text start="396.65" dur="6.37">creating the petrol you want and their</text>
  <text start="400.5" dur="6.15">currency that Chinese yuan is tracking</text>
  <text start="403.02" dur="6.42">gold even closer now than any other</text>
  <text start="406.65" dur="7.65">currency market and there&amp;#39;s a reason for</text>
  <text start="409.44" dur="9.51">this and we know that China when the</text>
  <text start="414.3" dur="8.34">time comes they will dump Treasuries not</text>
  <text start="418.95" dur="7.2">by the millions not by the billions most</text>
  <text start="422.64" dur="6.42">likely a trillion now think about what</text>
  <text start="426.15" dur="6.84">the IMF is doing right now the IMF is</text>
  <text start="429.06" dur="7.47">warning that risks are all out there</text>
  <text start="432.99" dur="6.06">that we&amp;#39;re going to see a second Great</text>
  <text start="436.53" dur="5.13">Depression and they&amp;#39;re saying these</text>
  <text start="439.05" dur="7.26">risks are because of China and the</text>
  <text start="441.66" dur="7.14">United States and the Fed as they raise</text>
  <text start="446.31" dur="4.74">rates they&amp;#39;re hurting the emerging</text>
  <text start="448.8" dur="5.85">markets they&amp;#39;re going to be hurting the</text>
  <text start="451.05" dur="4.17">global economy and this is not going to</text>
  <text start="454.65" dur="3.45">work out</text>
  <text start="455.22" dur="6.27">and they&amp;#39;re saying that major economies</text>
  <text start="458.1" dur="5.27">right now they have peaked and we must</text>
  <text start="461.49" dur="4.65">steer away and must resist</text>
  <text start="463.37" dur="6.84">self-sufficiency this is the IMF&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="466.14" dur="7.62">message now right on cue</text>
  <text start="470.21" dur="7.6">Trump double down on his criticism of</text>
  <text start="473.76" dur="6.93">the Fed now he was traveling to Iowa for</text>
  <text start="477.81" dur="4.56">a rally and said the Federal Reserve is</text>
  <text start="480.69" dur="7.65">moving too fast</text>
  <text start="482.37" dur="8.97">with interest rate increases hmm he went</text>
  <text start="488.34" dur="5.19">on to say I don&amp;#39;t like what the Fed is</text>
  <text start="491.34" dur="4.98">doing this is what he told White House</text>
  <text start="493.53" dur="6.63">reporters I think we don&amp;#39;t have to go as</text>
  <text start="496.32" dur="9.54">fast on rate hikes I like low interest</text>
  <text start="500.16" dur="7.74">rates he said already as soon as the Fed</text>
  <text start="505.86" dur="4.71">raised interest rates he&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="507.9" dur="5.37">criticizing the Fed once again</text>
  <text start="510.57" dur="5.94">now Michael Krieger tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="513.27" dur="5.73">following this is exactly why Trump can</text>
  <text start="516.51" dur="6.839">still win in 2020 even if the economy</text>
  <text start="519" dur="8.51">tanks he will blame the Fed and his base</text>
  <text start="523.349" dur="11.001">will eat it up actually this is the plan</text>
  <text start="527.51" dur="10.57">this is the entire plan he&amp;#39;s out there</text>
  <text start="534.35" dur="6.88">criticizing the Fed building the idea</text>
  <text start="538.08" dur="7.68">that the Fed is responsible for the</text>
  <text start="541.23" dur="6.66">economy collapsing Powell is working</text>
  <text start="545.76" dur="4.56">with them what is Powell saying Powell</text>
  <text start="547.89" dur="3.78">is saying listen I&amp;#39;m gonna keep raising</text>
  <text start="550.32" dur="3.63">interest rates and I don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="551.67" dur="5.28">market volatility I don&amp;#39;t care if the</text>
  <text start="553.95" dur="6.99">economy declines we are not going to</text>
  <text start="556.95" dur="6.06">stop because the Fed and Trump and the</text>
  <text start="560.94" dur="4.68">rest of the Patriots they know what</text>
  <text start="563.01" dur="5.79">happens when you raise rates go back in</text>
  <text start="565.62" dur="7.14">time they did it every single time and</text>
  <text start="568.8" dur="7.92">added the 13 times I believe 12 ended up</text>
  <text start="572.76" dur="6.63">in a recession this time isn&amp;#39;t any</text>
  <text start="576.72" dur="6.18">different this time they&amp;#39;re pushing it</text>
  <text start="579.39" dur="4.89">to a certain interest rate and I believe</text>
  <text start="582.9" dur="3.84">this is going to be around two point</text>
  <text start="584.28" dur="4.89">eight three percent once it reaches that</text>
  <text start="586.74" dur="6.42">point everything starts to</text>
  <text start="589.17" dur="8.039">all apart and Trump how to do something</text>
  <text start="593.16" dur="6.72">to delay all of this before he got</text>
  <text start="597.209" dur="4.261">Powell in there because the system was</text>
  <text start="599.88" dur="3.69">not doing well whatsoever everything was</text>
  <text start="601.47" dur="3.929">in a bubble it was going to crash if</text>
  <text start="603.57" dur="4.1">nothing was done the system would have</text>
  <text start="605.399" dur="5.971">come down this is why we got an</text>
  <text start="607.67" dur="6.21">injection of like sugar or a drug and</text>
  <text start="611.37" dur="5.76">all of a sudden the economy took off</text>
  <text start="613.88" dur="5.319">this is why Trump and the Patriots had</text>
  <text start="617.13" dur="4.47">to recalculate the GDP and add a</text>
  <text start="619.199" dur="5.25">trillion to it because he needed to make</text>
  <text start="621.6" dur="5.609">the economy look incredible he needed</text>
  <text start="624.449" dur="5.671">the economy to look like it is doing</text>
  <text start="627.209" dur="7.891">better than anyone could have imagined</text>
  <text start="630.12" dur="8.82">this way the mainstream media all the</text>
  <text start="635.1" dur="6.299">other financial pundits the other Fed</text>
  <text start="638.94" dur="6.199">Chiefs the IMF the biz all of it</text>
  <text start="641.399" dur="6.901">couldn&amp;#39;t say Trump wrote it down because</text>
  <text start="645.139" dur="8.081">Trump knew that he was going to have to</text>
  <text start="648.3" dur="6.599">implement tariffs Trump knew and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="653.22" dur="4.559">just not saying strumpets the group of</text>
  <text start="654.899" dur="4.56">people that working together knew that</text>
  <text start="657.779" dur="4.8">he was going to have to dismantle the</text>
  <text start="659.459" dur="5.341">globalist system and while he was doing</text>
  <text start="662.579" dur="6.361">this he needed a way for the economy to</text>
  <text start="664.8" dur="6.18">look incredible even though in the</text>
  <text start="668.94" dur="3.48">background if you look through all the</text>
  <text start="670.98" dur="3.93">illusionary statistical numbers that</text>
  <text start="672.42" dur="5.93">were manipulated in the background the</text>
  <text start="674.91" dur="5.64">economy is completely dead it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="678.35" dur="4.989">completely dead I mean think about it we</text>
  <text start="680.55" dur="5.159">have over a half a trillion of interest</text>
  <text start="683.339" dur="4.021">that we have to pay and the debt it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="685.709" dur="6.211">not slowing it&amp;#39;s moving up very very</text>
  <text start="687.36" dur="6.63">quickly this is on purpose because when</text>
  <text start="691.92" dur="3.779">we hit a certain point and they feel</text>
  <text start="693.99" dur="3.599">comfortable and I say they Trump the</text>
  <text start="695.699" dur="4.471">Patriots they feel comfortable we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="697.589" dur="7.62">a point where the system can come down</text>
  <text start="700.17" dur="6.029">and blame can be made to the fed showing</text>
  <text start="705.209" dur="2.221">that they&amp;#39;re the ones who are</text>
  <text start="706.199" dur="3.95">responsible for this</text>
  <text start="707.43" dur="6.75">that&amp;#39;s when it&amp;#39;s all going to happen and</text>
  <text start="710.149" dur="6.161">this is why the IMF the biz the</text>
  <text start="714.18" dur="6.48">mainstream media they&amp;#39;re all talking</text>
  <text start="716.31" dur="6.09">about a recession a depression because</text>
  <text start="720.66" dur="3.93">they already knew the economy was</text>
  <text start="722.4" dur="4.77">week they already knew that this was</text>
  <text start="724.59" dur="5.52">going to happen no matter what they</text>
  <text start="727.17" dur="5.01">already knew that this is where we are</text>
  <text start="730.11" dur="4.53">headed now they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="732.18" dur="4.95">control the narrative and blame this on</text>
  <text start="734.64" dur="4.59">Trump you hear the IMF already the IMF</text>
  <text start="737.13" dur="3.81">is already out there saying well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="739.23" dur="3.71">because of the trade wars it&amp;#39;s because</text>
