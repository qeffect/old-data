  <text start="72.35" dur="4.83">get into the economic collapse political</text>
  <text start="74.63" dur="4.5">and geopolitical news now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="77.18" dur="4.56">talking about how the Cabal how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="79.13" dur="4.59">backed against the wall and we said very</text>
  <text start="81.74" dur="4.159">soon they&amp;#39;re going to be pushing their</text>
  <text start="83.72" dur="5.28">agenda very hard creating chaos</text>
  <text start="85.899" dur="6.341">distractions everywhere and even trying</text>
  <text start="89" dur="6.03">to push us into war and we are</text>
  <text start="92.24" dur="7.08">definitely seeing that at this point and</text>
  <text start="95.03" dur="7.77">we see already the distraction with what</text>
  <text start="99.32" dur="4.92">happened with the da CA where the</text>
  <text start="102.8" dur="3.45">corporate media was out there and</text>
  <text start="104.24" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re calling Trump a racist</text>
  <text start="106.25" dur="5.22">well what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that it</text>
  <text start="109.85" dur="4.62">looks like there was a White House</text>
  <text start="111.47" dur="5.939">meeting and democratic lawyers were</text>
  <text start="114.47" dur="5.99">grilling the Department of Homeland</text>
  <text start="117.409" dur="6.75">Security Secretary Kerstin Nielsen and</text>
  <text start="120.46" dur="6.94">she said that she never even heard the</text>
  <text start="124.159" dur="6.39">president make any type of remarks that</text>
  <text start="127.4" dur="6.54">was be that that&amp;#39;s being reported on the</text>
  <text start="130.549" dur="4.951">corporate media she testified she did</text>
  <text start="133.94" dur="3.81">not recall Trump saying shithole</text>
  <text start="135.5" dur="3.799">countries while she spoke under oath</text>
  <text start="137.75" dur="4.44">before the Senate Judiciary Committee</text>
  <text start="139.299" dur="5.051">she described the meeting as heated and</text>
  <text start="142.19" dur="5.67">said many people in the room used coarse</text>
  <text start="144.35" dur="6.21">language now we understand that senator</text>
  <text start="147.86" dur="4.92">dick durbin he is the one who said that</text>
  <text start="150.56" dur="4.08">Trump said this now once again Trump was</text>
  <text start="152.78" dur="3.929">out there and he&amp;#39;s saying that yeah this</text>
  <text start="154.64" dur="5.129">is not true whatsoever I don&amp;#39;t use that</text>
  <text start="156.709" dur="5.101">type of language and we see already that</text>
  <text start="159.769" dur="3.481">this whole story is starting to fall</text>
  <text start="161.81" dur="4.25">apart because again there&amp;#39;s no proof</text>
  <text start="163.25" dur="5.93">it&amp;#39;s he said he said it&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="166.06" dur="5.649">meaningless in this entire thing now</text>
  <text start="169.18" dur="4.93">what is really happening is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="171.709" dur="6.211">getting very upset because they like</text>
  <text start="174.11" dur="4.92">having the DEA ca1 you can see that most</text>
  <text start="177.92" dur="3.719">of the individuals that are being</text>
  <text start="179.03" dur="4.889">brought into the country it was supposed</text>
  <text start="181.639" dur="4.111">to be set up so they would use these</text>
  <text start="183.919" dur="2.761">individuals to blend in with the United</text>
  <text start="185.75" dur="3.599">States so it</text>
  <text start="186.68" dur="4.949">make it easier for the transition into</text>
  <text start="189.349" dur="4.411">becoming a one-world government plus</text>
  <text start="191.629" dur="5.851">they were using these individuals for</text>
  <text start="193.76" dur="5.819">eventually getting Obamacare also</text>
  <text start="197.48" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re gonna use this these individuals</text>
  <text start="199.579" dur="5.19">to have them vote and they were gonna</text>
  <text start="201.92" dur="5.039">vote for their party and there were many</text>
  <text start="204.769" dur="4.381">other agendas associated with this and</text>
  <text start="206.959" dur="3.81">they don&amp;#39;t want this to end there is no</text>
  <text start="209.15" dur="4.14">problem with individuals coming into</text>
  <text start="210.769" dur="5.58">this country if they jump the border it</text>
  <text start="213.29" dur="6.41">doesn&amp;#39;t mean oh they&amp;#39;re here to stay why</text>
  <text start="216.349" dur="7.191">have the border then it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="219.7" dur="8.02">they need to go through proper vetting</text>
  <text start="223.54" dur="7.36">procedures just like every other country</text>
  <text start="227.72" dur="5.21">and we can see that they&amp;#39;re getting very</text>
  <text start="230.9" dur="4.559">very upset very angry because they see</text>
  <text start="232.93" dur="4.929">everything that they&amp;#39;ve done over the</text>
  <text start="235.459" dur="4.441">many many years is being all undone and</text>
  <text start="237.859" dur="3.75">this is why the arguments are heated</text>
  <text start="239.9" dur="3.66">this is why the corporate media is out</text>
  <text start="241.609" dur="4.921">there distracting and we also see that</text>
  <text start="243.56" dur="6.06">things are rapidly falling apart now out</text>
  <text start="246.53" dur="6.179">in Afghanistan we see the President</text>
  <text start="249.62" dur="6.239">Ghani and remember we need to go back in</text>
  <text start="252.709" dur="5.041">time and President Karzai was there</text>
  <text start="255.859" dur="3.3">beforehand he was the puppet government</text>
  <text start="257.75" dur="4.889">he wouldn&amp;#39;t sign the bilateral security</text>
  <text start="259.159" dur="6.451">agreement we had Kerry who was out there</text>
  <text start="262.639" dur="5.731">and he helped the elections along and</text>
  <text start="265.61" dur="4.89">kind of gut Ghani elected pointed</text>
  <text start="268.37" dur="3.359">everyone in that direction because he</text>
  <text start="270.5" dur="3.21">knew that he would sign the bilateral</text>
  <text start="271.729" dur="3.69">security agreement which a lap which</text>
  <text start="273.71" dur="4.709">would allow these soldiers to stay in</text>
  <text start="275.419" dur="6.24">Afghanistan now he was out there and he</text>
  <text start="278.419" dur="6.801">was saying that without the funding from</text>
  <text start="281.659" dur="6.651">the US which is around 90% of</text>
  <text start="285.22" dur="6.37">Afghanistan&amp;#39;s defense budget the entire</text>
  <text start="288.31" dur="6.579">national army wouldn&amp;#39;t last longer than</text>
  <text start="291.59" dur="6.569">six months on its own and the government</text>
  <text start="294.889" dur="6.27">would fall because what is happening</text>
  <text start="298.159" dur="5.94">here the rest of the country they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="301.159" dur="5.01">want this government it&amp;#39;s like every</text>
  <text start="304.099" dur="5.16">other country where we had regime change</text>
  <text start="306.169" dur="4.351">the people do not want this and the only</text>
  <text start="309.259" dur="3">reason they keep the puppet government</text>
  <text start="310.52" dur="5.699">in place is because the puppet</text>
  <text start="312.259" dur="6.511">government does what they want and again</text>
  <text start="316.219" dur="4.281">they don&amp;#39;t touch the poppy fields they</text>
  <text start="318.77" dur="2.96">let the Cabal do</text>
  <text start="320.5" dur="4.08">whatever they want inside the country</text>
  <text start="321.73" dur="5.64">and we see right now that if the funding</text>
  <text start="324.58" dur="5.43">is cut off in Afghanistan the government</text>
  <text start="327.37" dur="4.65">basically will fall and we saw already</text>
  <text start="330.01" dur="4.44">the routes have been blocked already</text>
  <text start="332.02" dur="4.08">from Pakistan into Afghanistan the</text>
  <text start="334.45" dur="4.02">terrorist routes have been blocked and</text>
  <text start="336.1" dur="4.41">supplies aren&amp;#39;t coming in to Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="338.47" dur="4.35">and this is going to be a huge problem</text>
  <text start="340.51" dur="5.01">the next step is to cut off the funding</text>
  <text start="342.82" dur="4.86">to Afghanistan or reduce the funding and</text>
  <text start="345.52" dur="4.65">this is where the problem is going to be</text>
  <text start="347.68" dur="4.35">where they won&amp;#39;t be able to survive and</text>
  <text start="350.17" dur="3.78">we can see that all of this is taking</text>
  <text start="352.03" dur="3.78">place and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if we</text>
  <text start="353.95" dur="6.27">hear this announcement come very very</text>
  <text start="355.81" dur="6.15">soon we see out in Canada Canada and the</text>
  <text start="360.22" dur="2.91">US are hosting a meeting on the Korean</text>
  <text start="361.96" dur="4.14">Peninsula deadlock</text>
  <text start="363.13" dur="7.23">they have diplomats from 20 different</text>
  <text start="366.1" dur="7.17">nations and it didn&amp;#39;t include Russia and</text>
  <text start="370.36" dur="6.12">China they were not invited and they</text>
  <text start="373.27" dur="6.21">border North Korea something doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="376.48" dur="5.85">sound right here and when we look at</text>
  <text start="379.48" dur="6.03">this we can see that this really is the</text>
  <text start="382.33" dur="5.31">coalition forces and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="385.51" dur="4.32">Russia or China involved in this why</text>
  <text start="387.64" dur="5.55">because they want this is all part of</text>
  <text start="389.83" dur="7.02">the Cabal they want war in North Korea</text>
  <text start="393.19" dur="5.34">now they&amp;#39;re going to relay you know</text>
  <text start="396.85" dur="3.42">whatever there is whatever is said in</text>
  <text start="398.53" dur="3.15">the meeting to Russia and China but we</text>
  <text start="400.27" dur="2.94">know that you&amp;#39;re not going to relay</text>
  <text start="401.68" dur="2.91">everything that they said because what</text>
  <text start="403.21" dur="3.959">they&amp;#39;re really trying to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="404.59" dur="5.25">trying to push war now Tillerson he did</text>
  <text start="407.169" dur="6">a complete 180 and now he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="409.84" dur="5.67">we reject the fries or the fries for</text>
  <text start="413.169" dur="4.711">fries approach and we&amp;#39;re not going with</text>
  <text start="415.51" dur="5.37">it why because in this meeting the cabal</text>
  <text start="417.88" dur="6.21">said this is what we are doing and again</text>
  <text start="420.88" dur="5.61">Tillerson Trump they&amp;#39;re playing the game</text>
  <text start="424.09" dur="4.59">both sides again behind the scenes again</text>
  <text start="426.49" dur="3.78">these are words it doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="428.68" dur="4.38">happening we need to look at their</text>
  <text start="430.27" dur="5.91">actions their actions are pushing talks</text>
  <text start="433.06" dur="6.18">between South Korea North Korea United</text>
  <text start="436.18" dur="4.02">States Russia China the Cabal they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="439.24" dur="3.42">want this to happen</text>
  <text start="440.2" dur="4.71">and again Tillerson trump they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="442.66" dur="4.59">playing good cop backup and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="444.91" dur="4.35">trying to balance all this and play the</text>
  <text start="447.25" dur="3.75">game where they say all of these words</text>
  <text start="449.26" dur="3.87">out on the corporate media sounds</text>
  <text start="451" dur="3.37">fantastic but this is not what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="453.13" dur="4.03">really doing</text>
  <text start="454.37" dur="6">but we see the Cabal they are now</text>
  <text start="457.16" dur="5.13">putting everything into place to try to</text>
  <text start="460.37" dur="5.1">start a war we understand there is a</text>
  <text start="462.29" dur="5.129">freeze of the drills in North Korea</text>
  <text start="465.47" dur="4.02">during the Olympics it&amp;#39;s not happening</text>
  <text start="467.419" dur="4.171">unless something changes it is not</text>
  <text start="469.49" dur="4.59">happening right now what we do</text>
  <text start="471.59" dur="5.09">understand is that the Cabal who has</text>
  <text start="474.08" dur="5.46">certain power within the Armed Forces</text>
  <text start="476.68" dur="5.44">they are preparing and getting ready for</text>
  <text start="479.54" dur="5.58">something much much larger they are</text>
  <text start="482.12" dur="6.299">bringing in a u.s. ec130 H comm-pass</text>
  <text start="485.12" dur="5.82">compass call aircraft which is capable</text>
  <text start="488.419" dur="4.321">of issuing a denial of service attack on</text>
  <text start="490.94" dur="3.539">enemy&amp;#39;s planes communication abilities</text>
  <text start="492.74" dur="4.23">and this was deployed through South</text>
  <text start="494.479" dur="6">Korea and we see that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="496.97" dur="5.85">be using this to monitor what is going</text>
  <text start="500.479" dur="5.581">on in the Olympics now will they use</text>
  <text start="502.82" dur="6.42">this to jam something because it is</text>
  <text start="506.06" dur="5.19">capable of noise jamming to disrupt</text>
  <text start="509.24" dur="5.01">enemy command and control communications</text>
  <text start="511.25" dur="5.039">maybe they will use this to kick</text>
  <text start="514.25" dur="5.64">something off because this would be a</text>
  <text start="516.289" dur="6.331">perfect time we also see that out of</text>
  <text start="519.89" dur="4.29">Bloomberg they&amp;#39;re bringing up the North</text>
  <text start="522.62" dur="4.53">Korean hackers and they&amp;#39;re saying yes</text>
  <text start="524.18" dur="6.15">they are completely responsible for the</text>
  <text start="527.15" dur="7.17">ransomware that we had just a couple of</text>
  <text start="530.33" dur="6.9">months ago and all the indicators and</text>
  <text start="534.32" dur="4.92">everything we&amp;#39;re looking at it all fits</text>
  <text start="537.23" dur="4.32">into North Korea because they&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="539.24" dur="5.039">the same exact stuff that they saw with</text>
  <text start="541.55" dur="5.43">Sony Pictures now remember the CIA has</text>
  <text start="544.279" dur="4.741">vault seven they can duplicate anything</text>
  <text start="546.98" dur="5.549">to make it look like it came from</text>
  <text start="549.02" dur="5.13">another country and once again if North</text>
  <text start="552.529" dur="4.321">Korea is really going to do this are</text>
  <text start="554.15" dur="5.25">they really gonna leave a piece of code</text>
  <text start="556.85" dur="6.6">in there or code it a certain way or</text>
  <text start="559.4" dur="6">have an IP tracked no they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="563.45" dur="3.87">to do this it makes no sense plus we</text>
  <text start="565.4" dur="5.25">know what Sony Pictures it was an inside</text>
  <text start="567.32" dur="6.09">job it wasn&amp;#39;t an outside hack it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="570.65" dur="4.11">a cyberattack and again the reason why</text>
  <text start="573.41" dur="2.97">you know this is because when they come</text>
  <text start="574.76" dur="3.329">out very very quickly and they tell you</text>
  <text start="576.38" dur="3.45">exactly who it is where it came from how</text>
  <text start="578.089" dur="3.841">it was done it&amp;#39;s completely impossible</text>
  <text start="579.83" dur="3.749">it&amp;#39;s almost like 9/11 where they came</text>
  <text start="581.93" dur="4.11">out and said okay the towers came down</text>
  <text start="583.579" dur="4.351">and within what a couple of hours they</text>
  <text start="586.04" dur="5.13">knew exactly who did it</text>
  <text start="587.93" dur="5.61">how come on they can&amp;#39;t even they</text>
  <text start="591.17" dur="4.83">can&amp;#39;t even figure out crimes that happen</text>
  <text start="593.54" dur="4.29">on the street in New York or in in</text>
  <text start="596" dur="3.63">Chicago they can&amp;#39;t even find these</text>
  <text start="597.83" dur="3.569">people but they can figure out what a</text>
  <text start="599.63" dur="3.63">state actor is doing very very quickly</text>
  <text start="601.399" dur="3.421">that&amp;#39;s ridiculous</text>
  <text start="603.26" dur="4.56">so they&amp;#39;re putting all the pieces</text>
  <text start="604.82" dur="5.34">together and they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="607.82" dur="5.67">their agenda and we can see that they</text>
  <text start="610.16" dur="6.15">are really pushing hard now we see Putin</text>
  <text start="613.49" dur="5.13">was out there and we understand that</text>
  <text start="616.31" dur="3.87">North Korea said that you know they</text>
  <text start="618.62" dur="3.69">would talk to South Korea they would</text>
  <text start="620.18" dur="4.02">even talk to the United States and Trump</text>
  <text start="622.31" dur="3.839">came out and said yes I would have</text>
  <text start="624.2" dur="4.59">conversations with Kim jong-un and of</text>
  <text start="626.149" dur="5.281">course you know he said he was have some</text>
  <text start="628.79" dur="4.41">type of relationship with him and the</text>
  <text start="631.43" dur="3.9">corporate media tried to spin it a</text>
  <text start="633.2" dur="4.47">different way and Trump was trying to</text>
  <text start="635.33" dur="4.44">correct it and that&amp;#39;s all distraction</text>
  <text start="637.67" dur="5.43">let&amp;#39;s look at what&amp;#39;s really going on</text>
  <text start="639.77" dur="6.59">here Putin had the following to say</text>
  <text start="643.1" dur="6.06">about Kim I think that Kim jong-un has</text>
  <text start="646.36" dur="5.349">obviously won this round he has achieved</text>
  <text start="649.16" dur="5.16">his strategic goal he has a nuclear</text>
  <text start="651.709" dur="5.581">warhead and now he also has a missile</text>
  <text start="654.32" dur="4.86">with a global range of 13,000 kilometers</text>
  <text start="657.29" dur="3.87">and of course he&amp;#39;s building this up</text>
  <text start="659.18" dur="3.84">that&amp;#39;s 8,000 miles keep that in mind</text>
  <text start="661.16" dur="5.16">8,000 miles that&amp;#39;s the distance from</text>
  <text start="663.02" dur="5.569">North Korea to Hawaii so Putin went on</text>
  <text start="666.32" dur="5.76">to say the following</text>
  <text start="668.589" dur="5.771">however we should be realistic and act</text>
  <text start="672.08" dur="4.89">extremely careful if we want to achieve</text>
  <text start="674.36" dur="4.5">the difficult goal of denuclearizing the</text>
  <text start="676.97" dur="4.59">Korean Peninsula we should do this</text>
  <text start="678.86" dur="3.78">through dialogue and talks we can</text>
  <text start="681.56" dur="2.79">accomplish this mission</text>
  <text start="682.64" dur="4.65">if all parties including North Korea</text>
  <text start="684.35" dur="5.07">become convinced that their security can</text>
  <text start="687.29" dur="5.96">be also guaranteed without nuclear</text>
  <text start="689.42" dur="8.64">weapons now when we read all of this</text>
  <text start="693.25" dur="10.079">what is he really saying well Putin is</text>
  <text start="698.06" dur="9.63">telling the cabal that small countries</text>
  <text start="703.329" dur="7.901">that have nuclear weapons can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="707.69" dur="7.82">messed with and if you want to talk</text>
  <text start="711.23" dur="7.77">without regime change we can do this and</text>
  <text start="715.51" dur="6.189">we can see right now he&amp;#39;s sending out a</text>
  <text start="719" dur="4.799">message that these countries</text>
  <text start="721.699" dur="4.62">know exactly what has been going on and</text>
  <text start="723.799" dur="5.19">they know how to protect themselves</text>
  <text start="726.319" dur="5.58">because the only way a small country can</text>
  <text start="728.989" dur="4.59">protect themselves is with a nuclear</text>
  <text start="731.899" dur="5.55">weapon because they just don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="733.579" dur="5.55">forces big enough to fight against the</text>
  <text start="737.449" dur="4.32">United States and the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="739.129" dur="7.411">but with a nuclear weapon they can fire</text>
  <text start="741.769" dur="10.711">this and destroy cities and create a lot</text>
  <text start="746.54" dur="8.639">of havoc and the Cabal noses Putin knows</text>
  <text start="752.48" dur="4.889">this and I believe this was a message to</text>
  <text start="755.179" dur="3.99">Trump letting them know that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="757.369" dur="4.01">sending this out to the Cabal letting</text>
  <text start="759.169" dur="5.04">them know that this is what is happening</text>
  <text start="761.379" dur="4.42">they&amp;#39;re pushing the idea that yes this</text>
  <text start="764.209" dur="3.57">can reach anywhere the corporate media</text>
  <text start="765.799" dur="3.6">is using it in a completely different</text>
  <text start="767.779" dur="3.33">way where they&amp;#39;re telling the world you</text>
  <text start="769.399" dur="2.94">need to be scared that they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="771.109" dur="4.23">attacking and their missiles can reach</text>
  <text start="772.339" dur="5.22">anywhere and the Cabal in their minds</text>
  <text start="775.339" dur="5.1">they think they can get into North Korea</text>
  <text start="777.559" dur="5.101">without North Korea firing a nuclear</text>
  <text start="780.439" dur="4.77">weapon they believe they can take him</text>
  <text start="782.66" dur="6.169">out and Putin is trying to tell him</text>
  <text start="785.209" dur="6.9">listen he has the ability don&amp;#39;t try it</text>
  <text start="788.829" dur="5.891">now we see out in Syria that&amp;#39;s number</text>
  <text start="792.109" dur="6.63">one this is they&amp;#39;re pushing their agenda</text>
  <text start="794.72" dur="6.179">in North Korea Putin is warning them</text>
  <text start="798.739" dur="4.8">sending a message to trump that the</text>
  <text start="800.899" dur="4.74">warning has been sent out there Trump</text>
  <text start="803.539" dur="5.46">has been trying to work on the inside</text>
  <text start="805.639" dur="6.331">with Patriots to talk about peace in</text>
  <text start="808.999" dur="3.99">Korea they want North Korea to become a</text>
  <text start="811.97" dur="3.63">nuclear power</text>
  <text start="812.989" dur="4.95">this is the only way they can have talks</text>
  <text start="815.6" dur="4.979">with North Korea without the Cabal</text>
  <text start="817.939" dur="5.85">coming in and having regime change now</text>
  <text start="820.579" dur="5.43">we move on to Syria and we see that this</text>
  <text start="823.789" dur="4.17">is being driven by McMaster he&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="826.009" dur="4.62">point person on this but the Cabal is</text>
  <text start="827.959" dur="4.021">behind him and they&amp;#39;re pushing forces up</text>
  <text start="830.629" dur="3.06">to the border of Turkey because they</text>
  <text start="831.98" dur="3.839">know that earth Awan he&amp;#39;s kind of a</text>
  <text start="833.689" dur="4.44">hothead and they&amp;#39;re trying to push his</text>
  <text start="835.819" dur="6.21">buttons right now and they want Turkey</text>
  <text start="838.129" dur="6.57">to invade and her Diwan is out there</text>
  <text start="842.029" dur="6.15">saying you know he wants and he Damai</text>
  <text start="844.699" dur="5.94">he&amp;#39;s demanding NATO take a stand on what</text>
  <text start="848.179" dur="6.691">is happening on the border of Syria and</text>
  <text start="850.639" dur="6.39">Turkey what are we doing here because</text>
  <text start="854.87" dur="4.86">the reports are coming out that her Juan</text>
  <text start="857.029" dur="6.331">is building up his forces and he might</text>
  <text start="859.73" dur="6.51">go into Syria now this is what I think</text>
  <text start="863.36" dur="6.6">the Cabal wants to happen here in Syria</text>
  <text start="866.24" dur="6.75">they know that they&amp;#39;re not gonna be able</text>
  <text start="869.96" dur="5.19">to split Syria up that that is out of</text>
  <text start="872.99" dur="4.89">the question right now unless something</text>
  <text start="875.15" dur="5.28">major major happens but right now they</text>
  <text start="877.88" dur="5.22">know the way it stands they can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="880.43" dur="5.72">this what they can do is take those</text>
  <text start="883.1" dur="6.69">forces in the Kurdish territory and</text>
  <text start="886.15" dur="5.62">sacrifice these individuals and this is</text>
  <text start="889.79" dur="5.94">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="891.77" dur="7.17">to use this force to bait her one into</text>
  <text start="895.73" dur="5.85">starting something her one is going to</text>
  <text start="898.94" dur="4.589">turn to NATO they want NATO involved her</text>
  <text start="901.58" dur="4.23">Diwan doesn&amp;#39;t want a war</text>
  <text start="903.529" dur="4.081">but they&amp;#39;re trying to push his buttons</text>
  <text start="905.81" dur="4.23">now I&amp;#39;m sure Putin is on the backend and</text>
  <text start="907.61" dur="5.49">China is on the back end talking to Iran</text>
  <text start="910.04" dur="4.02">saying listen don&amp;#39;t do anything don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="913.1" dur="5.16">fall for it</text>
  <text start="914.06" dur="6.89">don&amp;#39;t go into Syria don&amp;#39;t invade because</text>
  <text start="918.26" dur="7.579">the Cabal what they want is they want</text>
  <text start="920.95" dur="9.31">Turkey to go in there invade Syria and</text>
  <text start="925.839" dur="8.321">the Cabal wants NATO involved how does</text>
  <text start="930.26" dur="9">NATO get involved well if the Kurds</text>
  <text start="934.16" dur="9.69">attack Turkey they can initiate article</text>
  <text start="939.26" dur="8.46">5 which would allow NATO then to come</text>
  <text start="943.85" dur="7.679">into Syria because turkey is fighting</text>
  <text start="947.72" dur="6.45">against the Kurds and they fired</text>
  <text start="951.529" dur="4.531">missiles at Turkey and that is seen as</text>
  <text start="954.17" dur="4.56">an attack they can use article 5 and</text>
  <text start="956.06" dur="5.01">they can bring in NATO so the Cabal just</text>
  <text start="958.73" dur="6.45">got Turkey and NATO involved in this</text>
  <text start="961.07" dur="7.98">fight now once Russia and China see this</text>
  <text start="965.18" dur="7.349">happening well most likely they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="969.05" dur="6.84">get involved and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="972.529" dur="5.011">they&amp;#39;re trying to do so let&amp;#39;s look at</text>
  <text start="975.89" dur="2.43">this whole entire situation of what</text>
  <text start="977.54" dur="3.15">they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="978.32" dur="4.29">they might even push it a step further</text>
  <text start="980.69" dur="4.8">if they can&amp;#39;t get that going out in</text>
  <text start="982.61" dur="5.28">Syria they might even try to have</text>
  <text start="985.49" dur="3.18">something happen in Hawaii like we said</text>
  <text start="987.89" dur="4.56">before</text>
  <text start="988.67" dur="5.43">in our report on Sunday where they might</text>
  <text start="992.45" dur="4.56">have some type of nuclear weapon go off</text>
  <text start="994.1" dur="5.22">maybe in the ocean where they say this</text>
  <text start="997.01" dur="4.23">came from North Korea because let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="999.32" dur="2.96">think about this for a second of what</text>
  <text start="1001.24" dur="3.89">has been happening here</text>
  <text start="1002.28" dur="8.62">we know the Olympics are coming up in</text>
  <text start="1005.13" dur="9.28">February we know they positioned a plane</text>
  <text start="1010.9" dur="5.97">that can jam noise jam different</text>
  <text start="1014.41" dur="4.59">communication centers we know there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="1016.87" dur="5.16">aircraft carrier or maybe two aircraft</text>
  <text start="1019" dur="6.24">carriers out there we understand that we</text>
  <text start="1022.03" dur="5.52">just had a meeting up in Vancouver with</text>
  <text start="1025.24" dur="4.26">all the coalition forces and from</text>
  <text start="1027.55" dur="5.31">Tillerson reaction we can say they are</text>
  <text start="1029.5" dur="7.64">not happy with the drills being frozen</text>
  <text start="1032.86" dur="6.75">in the Korean Peninsula we also see that</text>
  <text start="1037.14" dur="4.72">the corporate media was out there</text>
  <text start="1039.61" dur="5.01">telling us that North Korea can fire a</text>
  <text start="1041.86" dur="5.31">missile and it can fly about 8,000 miles</text>
  <text start="1044.62" dur="6.66">which is the distance to Hawaii Hawaii</text>
  <text start="1047.17" dur="6.09">had a fake nuclear warning which took 40</text>
  <text start="1051.28" dur="3.71">minutes to correct this was their test</text>
  <text start="1053.26" dur="6.69">we see the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="1054.99" dur="7.39">recirculating the ransomware cyberattack</text>
  <text start="1059.95" dur="4.28">and they&amp;#39;re linking it to North Korea</text>
  <text start="1062.38" dur="4.86">this is all happening at the same time</text>
  <text start="1064.23" dur="7.81">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing is they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1067.24" dur="9.33">to do this push this event in two</text>
  <text start="1072.04" dur="9.96">different areas at the same time Turkey</text>
  <text start="1076.57" dur="7.2">NATO Russia China Syria the Kurds up in</text>
  <text start="1082" dur="4.14">that area in the Middle East then we</text>
  <text start="1083.77" dur="5.25">have North Korea where they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="1086.14" dur="5.04">everything they possibly can to make and</text>
  <text start="1089.02" dur="4.28">make everyone believe that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1091.18" dur="4.83">to be firing some type of nuclear weapon</text>
  <text start="1093.3" dur="5.41">now it doesn&amp;#39;t have to hit Hawaii it</text>
  <text start="1096.01" dur="5.94">could be off the coast it maybe it only</text>
  <text start="1098.71" dur="5.67">flew halfway as long as they can show</text>
  <text start="1101.95" dur="3.69">this now how do they do this well you</text>
  <text start="1104.38" dur="3.81">really think North Korea is gonna fire</text>
  <text start="1105.64" dur="5.76">it know they could launch it from a</text>
  <text start="1108.19" dur="6.57">submarine near North Korea and say yes</text>
  <text start="1111.4" dur="6.51">it was from there and they can have it</text>
  <text start="1114.76" dur="5.46">explode Midway and of course the</text>
  <text start="1117.91" dur="4.2">corporate media the Pentagon and those</text>
  <text start="1120.22" dur="4.65">people working with the Cabal</text>
  <text start="1122.11" dur="5.52">say the trajectory was Hawaii and if it</text>
  <text start="1124.87" dur="5.97">didn&amp;#39;t blow up it would have hit this is</text>
  <text start="1127.63" dur="5.64">seen as an attack I mean there&amp;#39;s so many</text>
  <text start="1130.84" dur="4.56">different scenarios here that they could</text>
  <text start="1133.27" dur="4.83">push this where they can make everyone</text>
  <text start="1135.4" dur="5.88">believe that this is happening or they</text>
  <text start="1138.1" dur="6.18">can actually have one reach right</text>
  <text start="1141.28" dur="5.1">outside Hawaii maybe a very tiny warhead</text>
  <text start="1144.28" dur="6.779">and have the explosion and let the</text>
  <text start="1146.38" dur="6.75">people on Hawaii actually see it because</text>
  <text start="1151.059" dur="4.921">this would scare them the alarms would</text>
  <text start="1153.13" dur="5.22">go off this would no longer be a drill</text>
  <text start="1155.98" dur="4.74">and they&amp;#39;d be like oh my god</text>
  <text start="1158.35" dur="4.17">were attacked so all this complaining</text>
  <text start="1160.72" dur="4.65">about what has happened and why it would</text>
  <text start="1162.52" dur="6.98">completely disappear and then the</text>
  <text start="1165.37" dur="7.77">president would have to react and again</text>
  <text start="1169.5" dur="6.52">Congress would vote for war at this</text>
  <text start="1173.14" dur="5.55">point think about what they can do here</text>
  <text start="1176.02" dur="5.39">remember what is happening with the</text>
  <text start="1178.69" dur="5.25">Kabam they&amp;#39;re losing the middle east</text>
