  <text start="90.85" dur="7.41">they&amp;#39;re not taking this existing economy</text>
  <text start="94.87" dur="5.73">and making it better because the central</text>
  <text start="98.26" dur="5.4">bank system is dead in the water there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="100.6" dur="6.24">nothing you can do with it it&amp;#39;s based on</text>
  <text start="103.66" dur="6.09">debt it&amp;#39;s based on a private</text>
  <text start="106.84" dur="5.4">organization creating the currency for</text>
  <text start="109.75" dur="5.97">the people and the big question is how</text>
  <text start="112.24" dur="6.21">do we get from point A to point B what</text>
  <text start="115.72" dur="6.81">has to happen to get from this central</text>
  <text start="118.45" dur="6.9">bank system to a new economy now can it</text>
  <text start="122.53" dur="6.089">just happen I don&amp;#39;t believe it can</text>
  <text start="125.35" dur="6.419">I believe the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="128.619" dur="5.73">bank those in power they&amp;#39;ve made it</text>
  <text start="131.769" dur="6.871">impossible to do this and you wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="134.349" dur="7.5">want to do it why well there&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="138.64" dur="5.429">gap between the wealthy middle-class and</text>
  <text start="141.849" dur="4.681">poor actually the middle class has been</text>
  <text start="144.069" dur="4.111">disappearing and what they&amp;#39;ve done is</text>
  <text start="146.53" dur="4.23">they made a lot of individuals dependent</text>
  <text start="148.18" dur="5.79">on the government there is a wage gap</text>
  <text start="150.76" dur="8.009">here there&amp;#39;s inequality and to move</text>
  <text start="153.97" dur="8.53">forward this inequality the wage gap has</text>
  <text start="158.769" dur="6.551">to be closed it has to be brought back</text>
  <text start="162.5" dur="4.8">where it was and I do believe that Trump</text>
  <text start="165.32" dur="5.34">of the Patriots they are doing this and</text>
  <text start="167.3" dur="8.22">I do believe moving into a new</text>
  <text start="170.66" dur="7.62">transitional government every tax that</text>
  <text start="175.52" dur="8.64">has been placed on us will have to be</text>
  <text start="178.28" dur="10.19">removed one by one slowly but surely to</text>
  <text start="184.16" dur="8.7">enable us to simply move into this new</text>
  <text start="188.47" dur="6.82">economic system and we see it happening</text>
  <text start="192.86" dur="3.45">oh and let me also mention that Trump in</text>
  <text start="195.29" dur="3.32">the Patriots they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="196.31" dur="4.44">reduce the expenses of the government</text>
  <text start="198.61" dur="5.83">and when we look at what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="200.75" dur="6.12">doing it&amp;#39;s happening now look what Trump</text>
  <text start="204.44" dur="5.25">has just done he tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="206.87" dur="5.55">following honor to finally put an end to</text>
  <text start="209.69" dur="4.74">the widows tax and ensure that our</text>
  <text start="212.42" dur="4.68">surviving military spouses receive their</text>
  <text start="214.43" dur="4.559">full benefits the spouses and families</text>
  <text start="217.1" dur="4.08">of our fallen heroes have suffered</text>
  <text start="218.989" dur="5.281">enough and we must do everything in our</text>
  <text start="221.18" dur="5.1">power to ease the burden so what is</text>
  <text start="224.27" dur="4.68">Trump doing here what is he talking</text>
  <text start="226.28" dur="6.72">about he&amp;#39;s talking about the widows tax</text>
  <text start="228.95" dur="6.02">what is the widows tax this tax affects</text>
  <text start="233" dur="5.43">the income of their surviving spouse</text>
  <text start="234.97" dur="7.39">once their partner passes away now the</text>
  <text start="238.43" dur="6.72">IRS tax code treats married people very</text>
  <text start="242.36" dur="4.5">differently than single people we have</text>
  <text start="245.15" dur="4.559">one set of tax rates for single people</text>
  <text start="246.86" dur="4.969">and a separate set of tax rates for</text>
  <text start="249.709" dur="5.851">those that are married because of this</text>
  <text start="251.829" dur="6.13">when a spouse dies the surviving spouse</text>
  <text start="255.56" dur="5.34">will often face an increase in income</text>
  <text start="257.959" dur="6.471">taxes at the same time that their income</text>
  <text start="260.9" dur="6.54">actually declines so think about an</text>
  <text start="264.43" dur="7.63">individual that is in the Armed Forces</text>
  <text start="267.44" dur="7.46">and they&amp;#39;re married they&amp;#39;re young and a</text>
  <text start="272.06" dur="5.3">the person who is out in another country</text>
  <text start="274.9" dur="6.269">he dies or she dies</text>
  <text start="277.36" dur="8.639">what happens then well</text>
  <text start="281.169" dur="9.3">they go to a single tax bracket their</text>
  <text start="285.999" dur="9.361">income declines but they&amp;#39;re still paying</text>
  <text start="290.469" dur="9.75">the taxes and it&amp;#39;s very hard on the</text>
  <text start="295.36" dur="8.609">individuals Trump was able to do away</text>
  <text start="300.219" dur="7.35">with this this is a benefit to the</text>
  <text start="303.969" dur="6.6">people we also have to understand is</text>
  <text start="307.569" dur="5.4">that Trump because over time the central</text>
  <text start="310.569" dur="6.241">bank system the deep state they have</text>
  <text start="312.969" dur="7.521">been pushing inequality in wages a lot</text>
  <text start="316.81" dur="7.919">of the lower-income people couldn&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="320.49" dur="9.19">good-paying jobs the upper echelon the</text>
  <text start="324.729" dur="7.381">1% the 2% the 5% the 10% they have it</text>
  <text start="329.68" dur="4.739">inside information and they&amp;#39;re able to</text>
  <text start="332.11" dur="5.309">make a lot of money this is why you see</text>
  <text start="334.419" dur="7.321">the 1% they have a lot of the wealth and</text>
  <text start="337.419" dur="7.65">the bottom 90% what has been happening</text>
  <text start="341.74" dur="6.66">their wealth has been declining they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="345.069" dur="7.41">moving in opposite directions Trump had</text>
  <text start="348.4" dur="6.6">to fix this this is why you see the jobs</text>
  <text start="352.479" dur="7.321">today that are being created there at</text>
  <text start="355" dur="9.509">the lower end allowing these people to</text>
  <text start="359.8" dur="6.81">work and to make money and you see wages</text>
  <text start="364.509" dur="5.671">increasing we talked about this on</text>
  <text start="366.61" dur="6.72">Friday and II puzzler tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="370.18" dur="5.789">following it&amp;#39;s all but impossible to</text>
  <text start="373.33" dur="5.88">look at this chart and conclude anything</text>
  <text start="375.969" dur="5.73">other that we at real Donald Trump tax</text>
  <text start="379.21" dur="5.069">cuts have unequivocally benefited</text>
  <text start="381.699" dur="6.03">working class Americans it&amp;#39;s the kind of</text>
  <text start="384.279" dur="6.45">benefit that wins elections what is he</text>
  <text start="387.729" dur="6.42">talking about here he&amp;#39;s showing that the</text>
  <text start="390.729" dur="7.62">wages have been increasing over time</text>
  <text start="394.149" dur="6.811">since Trump came into his presidency so</text>
  <text start="398.349" dur="6.421">he&amp;#39;s moving he&amp;#39;s removing more taxes</text>
  <text start="400.96" dur="6.929">actually last year he cut taxes people</text>
  <text start="404.77" dur="5.65">saw a benefit they received more of</text>
  <text start="407.889" dur="6.551">those funds</text>
  <text start="410.42" dur="7.08">and we see that income inequality is</text>
  <text start="414.44" dur="6.78">getting smaller and smaller as wages go</text>
  <text start="417.5" dur="7.8">up the bottom earners are really seeing</text>
  <text start="421.22" dur="7.41">the wages go up the most this is being</text>
  <text start="425.3" dur="6.03">done on purpose we also see Trump in the</text>
  <text start="428.63" dur="5.97">Patriots removing expenses from the</text>
  <text start="431.33" dur="5.64">government cutting slashing this all has</text>
  <text start="434.6" dur="4.89">to be done remember the globalists the</text>
  <text start="436.97" dur="7.05">central bank&amp;#39;s they had a completely</text>
  <text start="439.49" dur="8.21">different plan their plan was to bring</text>
  <text start="444.02" dur="6.47">down the system to make groups on</text>
  <text start="447.7" dur="6.94">opposite sides to keep them divided</text>
  <text start="450.49" dur="6.34">economically this was very important to</text>
  <text start="454.64" dur="5.81">the central bankers the deep state this</text>
  <text start="456.83" dur="7.47">is how they&amp;#39;re able to keep control</text>
  <text start="460.45" dur="6.25">Trump has removed all of this he&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="464.3" dur="5.67">in the process of doing it it has to be</text>
  <text start="466.7" dur="6.06">done for this transition everything that</text>
  <text start="469.97" dur="5.64">we&amp;#39;re watching now we&amp;#39;re watching it in</text>
  <text start="472.76" dur="4.53">real time we&amp;#39;re watching it happen every</text>
  <text start="475.61" dur="5.31">single day yes when you look back in</text>
  <text start="477.29" dur="5.79">history it&amp;#39;s much easier to see but when</text>
  <text start="480.92" dur="4.04">you&amp;#39;re watching it close up and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="483.08" dur="5.04">watching it happen right before our eyes</text>
  <text start="484.96" dur="5.2">it&amp;#39;s hard to see sometimes yes if we</text>
  <text start="488.12" dur="3.36">look back now and we look at what the</text>
  <text start="490.16" dur="3.6">central bank of the deep state have done</text>
  <text start="491.48" dur="6.11">in the past you can see it very clearly</text>
  <text start="493.76" dur="7.44">how they kept the divide economically</text>
  <text start="497.59" dur="7.54">how they kept the 1% increasing their</text>
  <text start="501.2" dur="7.59">wealth and the lower 99% losing their</text>
  <text start="505.13" dur="6.15">wealth couldn&amp;#39;t find jobs and this</text>
  <text start="508.79" dur="5.97">happened over many many years you also</text>
  <text start="511.28" dur="4.86">saw over time how jobs were moved out of</text>
  <text start="514.76" dur="4.05">the Unites States then when this was</text>
  <text start="516.14" dur="5.49">first mentioned people said now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="518.81" dur="6.3">ridiculous manufacturing would never</text>
  <text start="521.63" dur="6.03">leave the United States and what</text>
  <text start="525.11" dur="5.4">happened over time more and more</text>
  <text start="527.66" dur="5.79">manufacturers left the United States</text>
  <text start="530.51" dur="6.33">Trump now is reversing all of this it</text>
  <text start="533.45" dur="6.3">has to be done we know the central bank</text>
  <text start="536.84" dur="6.77">system can&amp;#39;t go on forever it&amp;#39;s in limbo</text>
  <text start="539.75" dur="5.99">right now it&amp;#39;s like an individual</text>
  <text start="543.61" dur="4.77">was being kept alive but there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="545.74" dur="6.539">brain function and eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="548.38" dur="6.57">going to happen is that person they</text>
  <text start="552.279" dur="5.011">won&amp;#39;t survive neither will this central</text>
  <text start="554.95" dur="5.37">bank system the central bankers already</text>
  <text start="557.29" dur="5.039">know this those in power they already</text>
  <text start="560.32" dur="3.99">know that their system only lasts for a</text>
  <text start="562.329" dur="5.221">certain period of time their system is</text>
  <text start="564.31" dur="7.14">not designed to last forever it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="567.55" dur="7.86">designed to control countries it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="571.45" dur="6.78">designed to keep their system alive and</text>
  <text start="575.41" dur="6.33">to control more and more and eventually</text>
  <text start="578.23" dur="5.609">control the world Trump now and other</text>
  <text start="581.74" dur="6.8">Patriots around the world they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="583.839" dur="9">stopping this it got to a point where</text>
  <text start="588.54" dur="8.02">countries the people are saying we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="592.839" dur="6.18">do this anymore and they started to turn</text>
  <text start="596.56" dur="5.67">on these central bankers we see it in</text>
  <text start="599.019" dur="7.591">the UK we see it in Italy we see it in</text>
  <text start="602.23" dur="7.4">France we see it around the world it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="606.61" dur="7.2">very difficult when you put pressure on</text>
  <text start="609.63" dur="6.639">individuals and you keep stripping their</text>
  <text start="613.81" dur="5.43">income away you keep stripping away the</text>
  <text start="616.269" dur="6">possibility of getting a job when you</text>
  <text start="619.24" dur="6.69">continually tax people it is a burden</text>
  <text start="622.269" dur="6.151">and people feel it people feel it when</text>
  <text start="625.93" dur="6.06">they&amp;#39;re not making money when they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="628.42" dur="6.09">have jobs and this is when people say I</text>
  <text start="631.99" dur="6.48">have nothing to lose and you see it</text>
  <text start="634.51" dur="7.29">happening around the world Trump the UK</text>
  <text start="638.47" dur="6.359">and many other countries this is all</text>
  <text start="641.8" dur="6.57">being reversed everything that they</text>
  <text start="644.829" dur="6.12">tried to do now is being reversed and</text>
  <text start="648.37" dur="5.839">every day you&amp;#39;re seeing more and more of</text>
  <text start="650.949" dur="6.181">it and once the us MCA comes online</text>
  <text start="654.209" dur="4.721">you&amp;#39;re going to see jobs flourish here</text>
  <text start="657.13" dur="5.34">in the United States like we&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="658.93" dur="5.82">seen before this is not to repair the</text>
  <text start="662.47" dur="4.26">central bank system this is to create a</text>
  <text start="664.75" dur="4.14">new system which is running parallel to</text>
  <text start="666.73" dur="4.71">a central bank system so when we remove</text>
  <text start="668.89" dur="4.8">the central bank system it&amp;#39;s an easy</text>
  <text start="671.44" dur="4.11">transition into the new system yes</text>
  <text start="673.69" dur="3.83">there&amp;#39;s going to be bumps yes there are</text>
  <text start="675.55" dur="4.1">certain individuals that are going to</text>
  <text start="677.52" dur="4.44">hurt but those who have been preparing</text>
  <text start="679.65" dur="4.89">those who are ready those who understand</text>
  <text start="681.96" dur="6.24">what is coming they&amp;#39;ll be able to</text>
  <text start="684.54" dur="5.34">weather the storm and how do you do this</text>
  <text start="688.2" dur="3.93">well you have some gold you have some</text>
  <text start="689.88" dur="5.61">food you have some supplies just like</text>
  <text start="692.13" dur="3.87">back in 71 when we moved off the gold</text>
  <text start="695.49" dur="3.24">standard</text>
  <text start="696" dur="4.56">onto a petrodollar system a lot of</text>
  <text start="698.73" dur="6.09">individuals got hurt they lost jobs</text>
  <text start="700.56" dur="5.64">couldn&amp;#39;t get fuel in the UK it was awful</text>
  <text start="704.82" dur="4.77">in many other countries it was terrible</text>
  <text start="706.2" dur="6.06">and this time it&amp;#39;s going to be no</text>
  <text start="709.59" dur="6.36">different than it was in the 70s except</text>
  <text start="712.26" dur="6.18">that we&amp;#39;re reversing it all and this</text>
  <text start="715.95" dur="6.39">time the Patriots are going to make sure</text>
  <text start="718.44" dur="5.34">that it&amp;#39;s as easy as possible but that</text>
  <text start="722.34" dur="4.44">doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s going to be perfect</text>
  <text start="723.78" dur="8.7">and we can see that they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="726.78" dur="7.65">it very slowly trying to even out what</text>
  <text start="732.48" dur="4.86">the central bankers what the deep state</text>
  <text start="734.43" dur="6.71">has done over the many many years and I</text>
  <text start="737.34" dur="7.44">do believe once the UK has their brexit</text>
  <text start="741.14" dur="5.17">once other countries catch on and they</text>
  <text start="744.78" dur="3.42">see what&amp;#39;s happening out in the UK and</text>
  <text start="746.31" dur="6.81">they see how well the country is doing</text>
