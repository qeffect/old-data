  <text start="166.65" dur="5.16">well did he really want these</text>
  <text start="169.049" dur="4.801">individuals or was he pressured by the</text>
  <text start="171.81" dur="3.51">Republican Party to put certain people</text>
  <text start="173.85" dur="3.51">in place remember a lot of the</text>

  <text start="180.72" dur="4.83">this and what he&amp;#39;s doing right now</text>
  <text start="183.39" dur="4.14">remember Comey was a banker he worked</text>
  <text start="185.55" dur="4.89">for HSBC</text>
  <text start="187.53" dur="5.79">he knew that there was money-laundering</text>
  <text start="190.44" dur="4.74">from drug traffickers within the bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="193.32" dur="5.52">banking system then he became the head</text>
  <text start="195.18" dur="5.67">of the FBI because that is a huge</text>
  <text start="198.84" dur="3.84">stretch I mean his resume must have been</text>
  <text start="200.85" dur="5.31">incredible no it was because he was a</text>
  <text start="202.68" dur="6.12">banker that why he was allowed to become</text>
  <text start="206.16" dur="5.46">the head of the FBI if you notice they</text>
  <text start="208.8" dur="4.71">like bankers in certain positions and</text>
  <text start="211.62" dur="4.17">I&amp;#39;m talking about the globalist of deep</text>
  <text start="213.51" dur="4.5">State the central bankers and right now</text>
  <text start="215.79" dur="4.919">the corporate media is out there saying</text>
  <text start="218.01" dur="4.77">that Trump is getting ready to basically</text>
  <text start="220.709" dur="4.881">remove many individuals from his</text>
  <text start="222.78" dur="5.52">administration like Reince Priebus maybe</text>
  <text start="225.59" dur="4.35">Spicer and many others and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="228.3" dur="4.05">naming all these different names and</text>
  <text start="229.94" dur="5.23">what we need to understand is eventually</text>
  <text start="232.35" dur="5.79">he will be removing all these</text>
  <text start="235.17" dur="4.56">individuals because he understands that</text>
  <text start="238.14" dur="3.42">most of these individuals are not</text>
  <text start="239.73" dur="4.44">working with him remember he&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="241.56" dur="5.55">stupid man he&amp;#39;s been in business for a</text>
  <text start="244.17" dur="4.86">long time he knows how to work deals he</text>
  <text start="247.11" dur="5.76">knows how to work people he knows how to</text>
  <text start="249.03" dur="6.15">play people yes he&amp;#39;s aggressive yes he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="252.87" dur="5.28">a New Yorker yes he doesn&amp;#39;t do things</text>
  <text start="255.18" dur="4.92">like people like him to do and again the</text>
  <text start="258.15" dur="4.65">globalist the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="260.1" dur="4.56">bank they&amp;#39;re still trying to control him</text>
  <text start="262.8" dur="3.96">in every way possible</text>
  <text start="264.66" dur="4.47">actually they&amp;#39;re trying to bury him if</text>
  <text start="266.76" dur="4.26">they possibly can and this is why</text>
  <text start="269.13" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re continually bringing up the idea</text>
  <text start="271.02" dur="5.76">of Russian collusion the Russians hacked</text>
  <text start="273.93" dur="4.59">the election system Russians Russians</text>
  <text start="276.78" dur="4.65">Russians because they really have</text>
  <text start="278.52" dur="4.8">nothing else at this point and we can</text>
  <text start="281.43" dur="5.13">see that this is all they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="283.32" dur="6.18">about because they&amp;#39;re trying to find one</text>
  <text start="286.56" dur="4.98">little thing and you know maybe there</text>
  <text start="289.5" dur="3.33">was an investment out in a different</text>
  <text start="291.54" dur="3.57">country that might have had ties to</text>
  <text start="292.83" dur="4.53">Russia well yes as business people</text>
  <text start="295.11" dur="4.14">especially billionaires I mean think</text>
  <text start="297.36" dur="4.32">about it someone who is in business</text>
  <text start="299.25" dur="4.11">around the world eventually does</text>
  <text start="301.68" dur="3.69">business with someone who has done</text>
  <text start="303.36" dur="4.38">business with Russia or you have even</text>
  <text start="305.37" dur="5.58">done business with Russia because before</text>
  <text start="307.74" dur="4.86">Putin took over the central bank before</text>
  <text start="310.95" dur="4.23">it was Russian aggression</text>
  <text start="312.6" dur="4.71">there were many individuals many</text>
  <text start="315.18" dur="4.44">millionaires billionaires that were</text>
  <text start="317.31" dur="3.99">doing business in Russia actually there</text>
  <text start="319.62" dur="6.359">are corporations that</text>
  <text start="321.3" dur="7.399">actually have businesses in Russia so we</text>
  <text start="325.979" dur="5.041">can see to create this idea of collusion</text>
  <text start="328.699" dur="4.18">they really have no evidence and if they</text>
  <text start="331.02" dur="2.16">did have evidence they come out with it</text>
  <text start="332.879" dur="2.341">already</text>
  <text start="333.18" dur="3.75">they would just display it all over the</text>
  <text start="335.22" dur="3.96">place believe me The Wall Street Journal</text>
  <text start="336.93" dur="3.6">CNN could be all over the place and</text>
  <text start="339.18" dur="3.18">remember those are the mouthpieces of</text>
  <text start="340.53" dur="5.43">the deep state now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="342.36" dur="5.839">interesting back when the elections were</text>
  <text start="345.96" dur="6.38">happening they needed to show that</text>
  <text start="348.199" dur="7.12">Russia did hack the election systems and</text>
  <text start="352.34" dur="6.579">they actually had a Russian hacker a</text>
  <text start="355.319" dur="6.361">Russian man who was hacking US companies</text>
  <text start="358.919" dur="6">and the FBI knew who he was they knew</text>
  <text start="361.68" dur="5.85">exactly what he was doing and he was</text>
  <text start="364.919" dur="5.22">Russian so they took this individual and</text>
  <text start="367.53" dur="5.91">remember what the FBI does it creates</text>
  <text start="370.139" dur="5.821">patsies they create the individuals they</text>
  <text start="373.44" dur="4.319">need and how do they do this well they</text>
  <text start="375.96" dur="3.959">promise them things and they say listen</text>
  <text start="377.759" dur="4.201">if you do this we will do that and this</text>
  <text start="379.919" dur="5.12">is what they did with this individual</text>
  <text start="381.96" dur="6.66">the individual who was hacking</text>
  <text start="385.039" dur="5.261">corporations now do they have proof of</text>
  <text start="388.62" dur="4.949">this maybe maybe not doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="390.3" dur="6.08">matter what they did is they offered him</text>
  <text start="393.569" dur="5.4">immunity to all of those charges in</text>
  <text start="396.38" dur="6.339">exchange for accepting responsibility</text>
  <text start="398.969" dur="7.38">for the cyber attacks targeting the</text>
  <text start="402.719" dur="8.241">Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton now</text>
  <text start="406.349" dur="7.141">FBI agents promised mr. neukölln money</text>
  <text start="410.96" dur="4.69">American citizenship and a free</text>
  <text start="413.49" dur="5.76">apartment for taking the fall over</text>
  <text start="415.65" dur="7.019">hacking the Clinton campaign now he</text>
  <text start="419.25" dur="7.229">wrote a letter and he laid it out</text>
  <text start="422.669" dur="6.03">exactly how the FBI did this he said</text>
  <text start="426.479" dur="4.47">they told me you&amp;#39;ll have to confess to</text>
  <text start="428.699" dur="4.53">breaking into Clinton&amp;#39;s inbox for</text>
  <text start="430.949" dur="4.891">president Trump on behalf of Russian</text>
  <text start="433.229" dur="5.731">President Putin and according to Google</text>
  <text start="435.84" dur="4.62">in the Russian hacker the proposal was</text>
  <text start="438.96" dur="3.81">made during the conversations between</text>
  <text start="440.46" dur="3.929">the 14th and 15th of November the</text>
  <text start="442.77" dur="4.98">following conversation then took place</text>
  <text start="444.389" dur="5.37">on February 7th and basically they were</text>
  <text start="447.75" dur="5.009">setting them up just like we&amp;#39;ve seen the</text>
  <text start="449.759" dur="5.21">FBI do in the past and the FBI right now</text>
  <text start="452.759" dur="4.76">well they&amp;#39;re not commenting on</text>
  <text start="454.969" dur="5.97">any of this because we can see right now</text>
  <text start="457.519" dur="5.82">they needed a patsy they needed someone</text>
  <text start="460.939" dur="5.25">to blame this on because they were</text>
  <text start="463.339" dur="4.89">trying to create this case that Russia</text>
  <text start="466.189" dur="3.81">was behind all this just like Russia was</text>
  <text start="468.229" dur="3.03">behind the hacking of the French</text>
  <text start="469.999" dur="4.17">elections even though they were done in</text>
  <text start="471.259" dur="4.89">paper ballots and the Russians were</text>
  <text start="474.169" dur="4.65">hacking Germany elections if you notice</text>
  <text start="476.149" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re only hacking those countries</text>
  <text start="478.819" dur="4.23">where they want their candidates the</text>
  <text start="481.129" dur="5.13">central bankers the globalist of these</text>
  <text start="483.049" dur="5.22">state individuals who are empowered to</text>
  <text start="486.259" dur="3.99">stay in power and those people who are</text>
  <text start="488.269" dur="4.38">trying to get into power they want those</text>
  <text start="490.249" dur="5.37">people in power so they need to make up</text>
  <text start="492.649" dur="5.88">the entire story that if things go south</text>
  <text start="495.619" dur="4.26">it was because of Russia and we can see</text>
  <text start="498.529" dur="3.9">right now this is what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="499.879" dur="4.02">doing all along and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="502.429" dur="3.63">there are certain individuals that are</text>
  <text start="503.899" dur="4.35">coming forth saying yet this is the way</text>
  <text start="506.059" dur="4.41">it really happened now we need to go</text>
  <text start="508.249" dur="5.1">back in time where the United States set</text>
  <text start="510.469" dur="4.891">up the coup d&amp;#39;etat in Ukraine where they</text>
  <text start="513.349" dur="4.38">ousted the elected leader they put in a</text>
  <text start="515.36" dur="4.469">puppet government and basically they put</text>
  <text start="517.729" dur="5.071">the country into so much debt that it</text>
  <text start="519.829" dur="4.711">can&amp;#39;t operate and an individual is</text>
  <text start="522.8" dur="3.3">coming forward because we know that the</text>
  <text start="524.54" dur="3.479">central banks this is what they do they</text>
  <text start="526.1" dur="3.299">take over a country and I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="528.019" dur="4.911">about the deep state the central banks</text>
  <text start="529.399" dur="5.761">they basically plunge the country into</text>
  <text start="532.93" dur="3.909">economic turmoil they put them into so</text>
  <text start="535.16" dur="3.51">much debt they can&amp;#39;t operate and then</text>
  <text start="536.839" dur="3.661">they start buying off a lot of their</text>
  <text start="538.67" dur="4.56">assets or taking a lot of their assets</text>
  <text start="540.5" dur="5.85">well the National Bank of Ukraine</text>
  <text start="543.23" dur="5.279">revealed the shocking secrets concerning</text>
  <text start="546.35" dur="4.08">the gold and foreign exchange reserves</text>
  <text start="548.509" dur="4.02">of the country the former head of</text>

  <text start="557.959" dur="6.48">reserves doesn&amp;#39;t belong to the country</text>
  <text start="560.75" dur="6.74">anymore 75% of all Ukrainian reserves</text>
  <text start="564.439" dur="6.9">are under the control of what the IMF as</text>
  <text start="567.49" dur="6.13">repayment of the numerous debts on loans</text>
  <text start="571.339" dur="4.201">granted to the country now I thought the</text>
  <text start="573.62" dur="4.769">central bankers thought gold was a</text>
  <text start="575.54" dur="5.489">complete barbarous relic that it&amp;#39;s not</text>

  <text start="647.4" dur="3.72">proof that this is what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="648.99" dur="4.89">doing now North Korea they have fired</text>
  <text start="651.12" dur="6.45">another missile which is kind of Inglis</text>
  <text start="653.88" dur="5.28">because if you go back to 2007-2008 all</text>
  <text start="657.57" dur="3.63">the way up to the present time they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="659.16" dur="3.72">been testing missiles all along it&amp;#39;s not</text>

  <text start="665.97" dur="4.41">South Korea president says I&amp;#39;m still</text>
  <text start="668.58" dur="3.81">open for dialogue with North Korea it</text>
  <text start="670.38" dur="4.44">makes no difference if this individual</text>
  <text start="672.39" dur="5.22">or the country fired a missile all</text>
  <text start="674.82" dur="7.1">countries fire missiles and they test</text>
  <text start="677.61" dur="8.07">their defensive systems and this is what</text>
  <text start="681.92" dur="5.65">North Korea is doing and of course as we</text>
  <text start="685.68" dur="4.95">can see right now that North Korea is</text>
  <text start="687.57" dur="5.4">still open to having dialogues with the</text>
  <text start="690.63" dur="4.35">Trump administration Trump said yes we</text>

  <text start="694.98" dur="3.84">are right now there is a report out</text>
  <text start="697.17" dur="3.6">there that Trump is looking to place</text>
  <text start="698.82" dur="4.14">more sanctions on North Korea because</text>
  <text start="700.77" dur="4.59">they fired a missile now he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="702.96" dur="4.92">invading and remember he still has to</text>
  <text start="705.36" dur="4.8">play with the deep state he still has to</text>
  <text start="707.88" dur="4.35">make them think that okay yes I would</text>
  <text start="710.16" dur="4.92">still go into North Korea I would still</text>
  <text start="712.23" dur="5.13">go into Syria but placing sanctions on</text>
  <text start="715.08" dur="4.32">North Korea doesn&amp;#39;t really do anything</text>
  <text start="717.36" dur="3.69">at this point because right now North</text>
  <text start="719.4" dur="3.03">Korea well they&amp;#39;re hurting from</text>
  <text start="721.05" dur="3.87">sanctions right now more saying</text>
  <text start="722.43" dur="4.2">guess what it&amp;#39;s not going to make it</text>
  <text start="724.92" dur="3.87">worse for them they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="726.63" dur="6.42">struggling this is why they started to</text>
  <text start="728.79" dur="6.78">sell opium to basically keep the country</text>
  <text start="733.05" dur="4.56">operating and of course as their trade</text>
  <text start="735.57" dur="4.2">grew and grew and grew the CIA was</text>
  <text start="737.61" dur="4.11">taking notice and as more sanctions were</text>
  <text start="739.77" dur="3.9">placed on North Korea the opium trade</text>
  <text start="741.72" dur="4.05">got larger and larger and larger because</text>
  <text start="743.67" dur="5.61">this was a source of what of North Korea</text>
  <text start="745.77" dur="6.75">making funds for the country to operate</text>
  <text start="749.28" dur="5.91">now the Russian missile warning system</text>
  <text start="752.52" dur="6.18">went off and Russia said yes we pick up</text>
  <text start="755.19" dur="6.27">the missile and the missile was twenty</text>
  <text start="758.7" dur="5.07">three minutes in flight and it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="761.46" dur="3.9">head towards Russia it was moving away</text>
  <text start="763.77" dur="4.47">from Russia that was so there was no</text>
  <text start="765.36" dur="6.48">threat there and basically it landed in</text>
  <text start="768.24" dur="5.91">the Sea of Japan we see Japan is looking</text>
  <text start="771.84" dur="3.69">at this and saying okay we need to</text>
  <text start="774.15" dur="2.88">protect ourselves because we could see</text>
  <text start="775.53" dur="3.57">that North Korea well they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="777.03" dur="4.26">continually firing missiles like every</text>

  <text start="804.15" dur="5.61">we know right now that the deep state</text>
  <text start="806.16" dur="5.04">they are continually pushing war if you</text>
  <text start="809.76" dur="3.3">look at the propaganda in the corporate</text>
  <text start="811.2" dur="4.29">media and around the world all they</text>
  <text start="813.06" dur="4.59">continually do is push the propaganda</text>

  <text start="817.65" dur="6.54">Russia&amp;#39;s coming for us and they keep</text>
  <text start="820.17" dur="7.59">this ongoing to keep us all on edge in</text>
  <text start="824.19" dur="6.86">the meantime we can see China South</text>
  <text start="827.76" dur="6.81">Korea parts of the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="831.05" dur="6.67">trying to calm the situation down but</text>
  <text start="834.57" dur="6.09">making the deep state think that yes the</text>
  <text start="837.72" dur="4.35">United States is still on their side and</text>
  <text start="840.66" dur="2.54">I when I say the United States I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="842.07" dur="4.65">talking about the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="843.2" dur="5.8">we see China right now they are going to</text>
  <text start="846.72" dur="4.14">be deploying an AWACS aircraft near the</text>
  <text start="849" dur="3.78">South China Sea and remember these</text>
  <text start="850.86" dur="3.39">nations they&amp;#39;re all on edge because they</text>
  <text start="852.78" dur="3.46">don&amp;#39;t know what the deep state is going</text>
  <text start="854.25" dur="4.029">to what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="856.24" dur="4.079">because they seen in the past what the</text>
  <text start="858.279" dur="4.53">deep space does they understand that</text>
  <text start="860.319" dur="4.671">they will push for war so Beijing right</text>
  <text start="862.809" dur="5.7">now deployed a pair of state-of-the-art</text>

  <text start="869.649" dur="5.43">to be keeping an eye on what the deep</text>
  <text start="872.499" dur="5.34">state is doing and what they are doing</text>
  <text start="875.079" dur="5.76">we see the BBC out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="877.839" dur="5.61">saying that they have evidence that yes</text>
  <text start="880.839" dur="6.23">Syria was behind the Syrian chemical</text>
  <text start="883.449" dur="6.091">weapons attack and you can see right now</text>
  <text start="887.069" dur="4.3">that they&amp;#39;re just continually pushing</text>
  <text start="889.54" dur="3.419">the propaganda out there and the</text>
  <text start="891.369" dur="3">question is why are they continually</text>
  <text start="892.959" dur="3.36">pushing the propaganda out there because</text>
  <text start="894.369" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out a way to</text>
  <text start="896.319" dur="6.36">get this invasion started and again they</text>
  <text start="900.459" dur="6.091">have no proof most of their information</text>
  <text start="902.679" dur="6">from the report is made by individuals</text>
  <text start="906.55" dur="4.079">that remain anonymous they won&amp;#39;t say</text>

  <text start="912.73" dur="3.839">they&amp;#39;re just saying that they have this</text>
  <text start="914.47" dur="4.739">proof and you need to believe us well</text>
  <text start="916.569" dur="4.411">before we invade anywhere before we go</text>
  <text start="919.209" dur="4.891">to war don&amp;#39;t you think it&amp;#39;s time that</text>
  <text start="920.98" dur="5.01">they show us conclusive proof that this</text>
  <text start="924.1" dur="3.63">country actually did and show all the</text>
  <text start="925.99" dur="4.349">evidence and how it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="927.73" dur="4.769">connected instead of saying yes it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="932.499" dur="4.95">have this evidence but we can&amp;#39;t show you</text>
  <text start="934.749" dur="4.83">just please believe us I think that time</text>
  <text start="937.449" dur="4.44">has passed now and now it&amp;#39;s time for</text>
  <text start="939.579" dur="4.831">them to show all the proof they have and</text>
  <text start="941.889" dur="5.82">drop the propaganda and that&amp;#39;s where the</text>
  <text start="944.41" dur="5.369">problem comes in now last report report</text>
  <text start="947.709" dur="3.99">before that we were showing these</text>
  <text start="949.779" dur="5.4">satellite pictures actually pictures</text>
  <text start="951.699" dur="6.51">from a drone showing uh the bases near</text>
  <text start="955.179" dur="6.15">the Syrian border and according to</text>
  <text start="958.209" dur="5.73">reports these the Syrian Armed Forces</text>
  <text start="961.329" dur="5.461">they had a UAV which captured footage of</text>
  <text start="963.939" dur="5.88">a large military buildup believed to be</text>

  <text start="972.009" dur="3.69">footage were released by the various</text>
  <text start="973.42" dur="4.05">media outlets and those images show a</text>
  <text start="975.699" dur="4.17">large buildup of light heavy equipment</text>
  <text start="977.47" dur="5.309">including tanks and APCs and are claimed</text>

  <text start="982.779" dur="5.28">Forces aided with heavy armor alongside</text>
  <text start="985.059" dur="4.621">the Jordanian military presence now when</text>
  <text start="988.059" dur="3.361">we look at this the story</text>
  <text start="989.68" dur="3.719">doesn&amp;#39;t really add up and we take a very</text>
  <text start="991.42" dur="6.03">close look at this something doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="993.399" dur="6.241">seem right now the mention camp is in</text>
  <text start="997.45" dur="4.38">fact one of the largest armed armored</text>
  <text start="999.64" dur="3.9">Depot&amp;#39;s of the Jordanian army and again</text>
  <text start="1001.83" dur="3.93">this is 48 kilometers away from the</text>
  <text start="1003.54" dur="3.69">border of Syria by doing a small</text>
  <text start="1005.76" dur="3.36">comparison between the available</text>
  <text start="1007.23" dur="4.35">satellite images and claimed images</text>
  <text start="1009.12" dur="4.86">taken by the drone the following is</text>
  <text start="1011.58" dur="4.74">observed most of the armor at the camp</text>
  <text start="1013.98" dur="5.16">have not been moved since at least 2015</text>
  <text start="1016.32" dur="6.42">and most likely that the camp has</text>
  <text start="1019.14" dur="5.37">nothing to do with recent US interest in</text>
  <text start="1022.74" dur="4.92">deploying troops to southern Syria to</text>
  <text start="1024.51" dur="5.97">fight Islamic state also if the mention</text>
  <text start="1027.66" dur="5.549">camp really had us and UK troops how</text>
  <text start="1030.48" dur="5.609">could a drone fly 48 kilometres into</text>
  <text start="1033.209" dur="5.701">Jordanian airspace capture the images</text>
  <text start="1036.089" dur="5.461">and leave undetected keep in mind of</text>
  <text start="1038.91" dur="4.26">course that the Jordanian Jordanian</text>
  <text start="1041.55" dur="3.48">airspace has been under US protection</text>
  <text start="1043.17" dur="5.399">since 2012 what we&amp;#39;re looking at right</text>
  <text start="1045.03" dur="5.67">now most likely is a complete diversion</text>
  <text start="1048.569" dur="4.621">and the corporate media is out there</text>
  <text start="1050.7" dur="4.68">saying that this is where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1053.19" dur="4.08">building up the forces this is where the</text>
  <text start="1055.38" dur="3.99">attack is going to happen I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1057.27" dur="4.17">going to happen someplace completely</text>
  <text start="1059.37" dur="4.92">different I think this was put out there</text>
  <text start="1061.44" dur="4.89">as a propaganda technique do I think</text>
  <text start="1064.29" dur="4.019">it&amp;#39;s going to be US soldiers and UK</text>
  <text start="1066.33" dur="3.33">soldiers and the coalition forces no I</text>
  <text start="1068.309" dur="3.361">think it&amp;#39;s going to be paid mercenaries</text>
  <text start="1069.66" dur="4.11">that they&amp;#39;re building up giving them</text>
  <text start="1071.67" dur="6.389">equipment but we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see</text>
  <text start="1073.77" dur="9.05">now if there is an event I believe the</text>
  <text start="1078.059" dur="7.381">invasion will include US soldiers</text>
  <text start="1082.82" dur="4.66">coalition forces because they&amp;#39;ll try to</text>
  <text start="1085.44" dur="3.66">convince the Trump administration that</text>
  <text start="1087.48" dur="3.69">we have to invade because of this</text>
  <text start="1089.1" dur="4.68">gigantic event do I think it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1091.17" dur="4.65">come from this area no I think this was</text>
  <text start="1093.78" dur="4.38">a complete setup because the corporate</text>
  <text start="1095.82" dur="4.59">media was pushing it way too hard</text>
  <text start="1098.16" dur="4.2">showing these pictures and making</text>
  <text start="1100.41" dur="3.63">everyone believe that this is where it</text>
  <text start="1102.36" dur="4.14">was coming from and I think this is a</text>
  <text start="1104.04" dur="4.769">complete diversion of where it will be</text>
  <text start="1106.5" dur="5.49">coming from now we can see that this</text>
  <text start="1108.809" dur="6.361">cyber attack this ransomware well it hit</text>
  <text start="1111.99" dur="5.819">many different areas it hit the and this</text>
  <text start="1115.17" dur="5.639">is the wanna cry ransom where attack</text>
  <text start="1117.809" dur="5.921">which was out there since March actually</text>
  <text start="1120.809" dur="4.871">almost a year ago and the</text>
  <text start="1123.73" dur="3.66">purity holes in all these different</text>
  <text start="1125.68" dur="3.39">systems well that was created by the</text>
  <text start="1127.39" dur="3.99">United States and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1129.07" dur="5.22">interesting about this is that it hit</text>
  <text start="1131.38" dur="5.58">many many countries and it hit many many</text>
  <text start="1134.29" dur="4.23">different places like the British public</text>
  <text start="1136.96" dur="4.02">health services to work the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1138.52" dur="5.55">fifth largest employer with about 1.7</text>

  <text start="1157.63" dur="5.94">telephone giant said it was attacked by</text>
  <text start="1159.64" dur="6.48">the ransomware we see that many many</text>
  <text start="1163.57" dur="5.55">many countries were hit now one country</text>
  <text start="1166.12" dur="5.16">that wasn&amp;#39;t really hit too hard hmm</text>
  <text start="1169.12" dur="4.14">was the United States that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1171.28" dur="5.37">interesting right off the bat</text>
  <text start="1173.26" dur="5.76">yes FedEx did report that they were hit</text>
  <text start="1176.65" dur="3.45">with the malware but they quickly</text>
  <text start="1179.02" dur="3.21">cleaned it up</text>
  <text start="1180.1" dur="3.81">now remember Microsoft had a pact back</text>
  <text start="1182.23" dur="4.08">in March and they&amp;#39;re saying a lot of</text>
  <text start="1183.91" dur="6.96">these companies while they never applied</text>
  <text start="1186.31" dur="8.31">to patch China was also hit very</text>
  <text start="1190.87" dur="6.78">interestingly and they were hit</text>
  <text start="1194.62" dur="5.28">not just in different companies but</text>
  <text start="1197.65" dur="5.82">their ATM machines they were taken</text>

  <text start="1203.47" dur="6.75">hit immigration authorities were hit and</text>
  <text start="1206.19" dur="7.63">we could see that this whole thing was</text>
  <text start="1210.22" dur="6.36">being done across the world so the world</text>
  <text start="1213.82" dur="4.74">is being held for ransom right now so</text>
  <text start="1216.58" dur="4.05">the question is is the deep state</text>
  <text start="1218.56" dur="3.57">sending a message and I believe there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1220.63" dur="4.5">many different agendas associated with</text>
  <text start="1222.13" dur="5.76">this the deep state is sending a message</text>
  <text start="1225.13" dur="5.25">to the world that listen we&amp;#39;re still in</text>
  <text start="1227.89" dur="5.7">control and we can do whatever we want</text>
  <text start="1230.38" dur="5.13">to your systems look at this the second</text>
  <text start="1233.59" dur="3.06">agenda I do believe and I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1235.51" dur="3.48">going to make a really big deal about</text>
  <text start="1236.65" dur="6.66">this maybe later on this week where</text>
  <text start="1238.99" dur="7.08">Bitcoin was used for the currency</text>
  <text start="1243.31" dur="6.6">transfer where they&amp;#39;re going to say okay</text>
  <text start="1246.07" dur="7.32">bitcoin is something that these</text>
  <text start="1249.91" dur="6.21">criminals use and we need to have some</text>
  <text start="1253.39" dur="4.1">type of regulation or we need to outlaw</text>
  <text start="1256.12" dur="3.5">Bitcoin or something</text>
  <text start="1257.49" dur="3.27">like that which I can see this is what</text>
  <text start="1259.62" dur="3.42">the central banks would want because</text>
  <text start="1260.76" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s decentralized they have no control</text>
  <text start="1263.04" dur="4.2">over and I think there&amp;#39;s many different</text>
  <text start="1265.29" dur="3.45">agendas associated with this and when we</text>
  <text start="1267.24" dur="6.3">look at this we can see that the world</text>
  <text start="1268.74" dur="7.2">is basically being held for ransom and I</text>
  <text start="1273.54" dur="4.29">think it&amp;#39;s a message from the deep state</text>
  <text start="1275.94" dur="3">now the United States the deep state</text>
  <text start="1277.83" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re never going to say they&amp;#39;re part</text>
  <text start="1278.94" dur="5.07">of this this will be blamed on someone</text>
  <text start="1281.34" dur="5.37">else but I think this was the message to</text>
  <text start="1284.01" dur="6.99">all of these countries don&amp;#39;t mess with</text>
  <text start="1286.71" dur="6.99">us because we can control every aspect</text>
  <text start="1291" dur="6.3">of your country we can bring it down in</text>
  <text start="1293.7" dur="6.229">a second now something very interesting</text>
  <text start="1297.3" dur="5.19">a UK security researcher has</text>
  <text start="1299.929" dur="3.341">accidentally halted the spread of the</text>
  <text start="1302.49" dur="3.39">ransomware</text>
  <text start="1303.27" dur="5.37">now he was looking at the code he&amp;#39;s 22</text>
  <text start="1305.88" dur="5.13">years old his his name that he goes by</text>
  <text start="1308.64" dur="4.26">his malware Tech and he was looking at</text>
  <text start="1311.01" dur="4.049">the code and said hmm I found something</text>
  <text start="1312.9" dur="4.04">very interesting in the code and it</text>
  <text start="1315.059" dur="5.761">looks like it is a kill switch</text>
  <text start="1316.94" dur="6.28">now basically his discovery</text>
  <text start="1320.82" dur="4.859">well it didn&amp;#39;t repair the damage done by</text>
  <text start="1323.22" dur="5.43">the ransomware but it did stop it from</text>
  <text start="1325.679" dur="4.771">spreading to new computers now what</text>
  <text start="1328.65" dur="3.63">exactly did he discover the researcher</text>
  <text start="1330.45" dur="3.99">first noticed that the malware was</text>
  <text start="1332.28" dur="3.779">trying to contact a specific web address</text>
  <text start="1334.44" dur="3.84">every time it affected a new computer</text>
  <text start="1336.059" dur="4.651">but the web address it was trying to</text>
  <text start="1338.28" dur="5.34">contact along with jumble of letters it</text>
  <text start="1340.71" dur="4.44">has not been registered so malware tech</text>
  <text start="1343.62" dur="3.9">decided to register it and bought it for</text>
  <text start="1345.15" dur="4.77">ten dollars and 69 cents this was a</text>
  <text start="1347.52" dur="3.81">domain that he purchased owning it would</text>
  <text start="1349.92" dur="4.05">let him see where computers were</text>
  <text start="1351.33" dur="5.13">accessing it from and give him an idea</text>
  <text start="1353.97" dur="5.85">of how the widespread brands number was</text>
  <text start="1356.46" dur="5.4">so by doing so he triggered part of the</text>
  <text start="1359.82" dur="4.56">ransom where&amp;#39;s code they told it to</text>
  <text start="1361.86" dur="5.49">continually spread and it stopped it in</text>
  <text start="1364.38" dur="5.25">its tracks so the type of code is known</text>
  <text start="1367.35" dur="3.9">as a kill switch which some attackers</text>
  <text start="1369.63" dur="4.65">used to halt the spread of the software</text>
  <text start="1371.25" dur="6.51">if things get out of hand he tested it</text>
  <text start="1374.28" dur="7.59">and it worked it completely stopped the</text>
  <text start="1377.76" dur="6.06">rants ransomware from spreading now he</text>
  <text start="1381.87" dur="3.96">thinks the code was originally designed</text>
  <text start="1383.82" dur="3.599">to thwart researchers trying to</text>
  <text start="1385.83" dur="4.08">investigate the ransomware but it</text>
  <text start="1387.419" dur="3.931">backfired by letting them remotely</text>
  <text start="1389.91" dur="3.39">disable it</text>
  <text start="1391.35" dur="3.66">and it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the ransomware</text>
  <text start="1393.3" dur="5.49">is defeated because those computers are</text>
  <text start="1395.01" dur="5.7">infected they are still infected so what</text>
  <text start="1398.79" dur="3.33">we&amp;#39;re looking at right now it looks like</text>
  <text start="1400.71" dur="4.68">there&amp;#39;s many different agendas</text>
  <text start="1402.12" dur="4.89">associated with this ransomware and I do</text>
  <text start="1405.39" dur="3.77">believe this is coming from the deep</text>
  <text start="1407.01" dur="6.09">state this is going to be a hit on</text>
  <text start="1409.16" dur="6.61">Bitcoin and they&amp;#39;re sending a message to</text>
  <text start="1413.1" dur="4.92">all of the countries saying listen don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1415.77" dur="3.6">mess with us we will bring you down</text>
