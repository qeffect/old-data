  <text start="136.84" dur="3.149">stories come out of the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="138.01" dur="3.96">and they&amp;#39;re gonna say this is not right</text>
  <text start="139.989" dur="4.941">this shouldn&amp;#39;t be like this and we need</text>
  <text start="141.97" dur="8.15">to understand what is going on here as</text>
  <text start="144.93" dur="8.26">we move into a new economic system and</text>
  <text start="150.12" dur="6.13">everything starts to fall apart the</text>
  <text start="153.19" dur="6.9">government will not be able to support</text>
  <text start="156.25" dur="6.06">what we once had the money printing the</text>
  <text start="160.09" dur="5.789">funny money the creation of this</text>
  <text start="162.31" dur="6.03">currency out of thin air well that is</text>
  <text start="165.879" dur="4.671">not going to happen anymore there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="168.34" dur="6.69">going to have to be checks and balances</text>
  <text start="170.55" dur="6.519">to make sure the economy is strong the</text>
  <text start="175.03" dur="4.8">days of the central bank they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="177.069" dur="4.92">to be coming to an end and this free</text>
  <text start="179.83" dur="4.739">credit card of just creating as much as</text>
  <text start="181.989" dur="3.17">you want out of thin air is also coming</text>
  <text start="184.569" dur="2.371">to an end</text>
  <text start="185.159" dur="4.961">so what we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="186.94" dur="5.07">is we&amp;#39;re going to see the Patriots</text>
  <text start="190.12" dur="4.47">within government they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="192.01" dur="5.13">to cut programs and government is going</text>
  <text start="194.59" dur="4.5">to have to shrink and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="197.14" dur="3.72">are not going to like this and a lot of</text>
  <text start="199.09" dur="4.02">people are gonna actually hate this</text>
  <text start="200.86" dur="4.74">we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot of the regulations</text>
  <text start="203.11" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re gonna be dismantled because all</text>
  <text start="205.6" dur="4.53">these regulations that were built up</text>
  <text start="206.95" dur="5.73">over time they didn&amp;#39;t help the country</text>
  <text start="210.13" dur="3.93">they didn&amp;#39;t help the economy I mean if</text>
  <text start="212.68" dur="3.39">you&amp;#39;re not gonna follow the law</text>
  <text start="214.06" dur="3.72">why create more laws and more</text>
  <text start="216.07" dur="4.65">regulations in the in the first place</text>
  <text start="217.78" dur="5.37">you might as well follow the ones that</text>
  <text start="220.72" dur="6">you have and just because you have more</text>
  <text start="223.15" dur="6.3">laws doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s better safer more</text>
  <text start="226.72" dur="5.97">efficient actually normally what that</text>
  <text start="229.45" dur="7.74">means it&amp;#39;s the opposite and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="232.69" dur="7.38">seeing right now is Trump has suggested</text>
  <text start="237.19" dur="5.7">to cut down on the number of earnings</text>
  <text start="240.07" dur="6.09">reports public companies should present</text>
  <text start="242.89" dur="6.27">to the investing public from quarterly</text>
  <text start="246.16" dur="4.08">to semi-annually and then people are out</text>
  <text start="249.16" dur="1.68">there saying oh my god this is</text>
  <text start="250.24" dur="2.25">ridiculous</text>
  <text start="250.84" dur="3.869">how are we gonna know what the companies</text>
  <text start="252.49" dur="4.2">are doing well remember Enron remember</text>
  <text start="254.709" dur="4.411">all the other companies they were giving</text>
  <text start="256.69" dur="5.97">you fake phony and false information</text>
  <text start="259.12" dur="6.81">anyhow because those in these</text>
  <text start="262.66" dur="7.05">departments weren&amp;#39;t doing their job at</text>
  <text start="265.93" dur="6.54">all so the more regulations didn&amp;#39;t help</text>
  <text start="269.71" dur="5.78">did it but the real reason why this is</text>
  <text start="272.47" dur="7.62">happening is because they found out that</text>
  <text start="275.49" dur="7.54">nobody is reading them and countin</text>
  <text start="280.09" dur="5.61">Brooke Liv asked how many people read</text>
  <text start="283.03" dur="6.84">the financial reports guess what</text>
  <text start="285.7" dur="6.9">not much in fact not many at all well</text>
  <text start="289.87" dur="5.37">take a guess how many people read the</text>
  <text start="292.6" dur="7.68">10k annual report how many downloads</text>
  <text start="295.24" dur="10.74">does it get on average thousands tens of</text>
  <text start="300.28" dur="10.11">thousands how about 28 that&amp;#39;s it there</text>
  <text start="305.98" dur="6.84">are more people working at the FASB the</text>
  <text start="310.39" dur="6.27">accounting regulator then financial</text>
  <text start="312.82" dur="6.24">report readers and we see with the</text>
  <text start="316.66" dur="3.84">bigger companies the large companies the</text>
  <text start="319.06" dur="3">10 Ches</text>
  <text start="320.5" dur="2.76">with many investors and analysts are</text>
  <text start="322.06" dur="4.47">down learn more frequently of course</text>
  <text start="323.26" dur="6.35">more than 28 times but not much more the</text>
  <text start="326.53" dur="7.38">20% largest US companies get on average</text>
  <text start="329.61" dur="6.79">96 point to total 10k downloads during</text>
  <text start="333.91" dur="7.14">the filing day and the subsequent four</text>
  <text start="336.4" dur="7.08">days so what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is that</text>
  <text start="341.05" dur="2.99">not many people even are even looking at</text>
  <text start="343.48" dur="3.72">this</text>
  <text start="344.04" dur="5.32">so it&amp;#39;s meaningless and what it looks</text>
  <text start="347.2" dur="5.19">like to me is that these departments are</text>
  <text start="349.36" dur="6.45">going to be cut down and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="352.39" dur="6.12">see regulations change because we might</text>
  <text start="355.81" dur="4.44">as well follow the regulations that we</text>
  <text start="358.51" dur="3.51">have and the laws that we have instead</text>
  <text start="360.25" dur="3.45">of creating new ones that just ride on</text>
  <text start="362.02" dur="4.94">top of the same ones that we&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="363.7" dur="5.34">following and we need to cut down on</text>
  <text start="366.96" dur="4">government the government is way too big</text>
  <text start="369.04" dur="5.7">too many people are employed there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="370.96" dur="6">reason for all of this and why all this</text>
  <text start="374.74" dur="4.5">is happening is this is all being</text>
  <text start="376.96" dur="4.62">prepared for what is about to happen and</text>
  <text start="379.24" dur="4.89">we talk about inflation we talk about</text>
  <text start="381.58" dur="4.53">the economic conditions we talk about</text>
  <text start="384.13" dur="4.11">what is happening in the real economy</text>
  <text start="386.11" dur="6.36">and we see out in many different</text>
  <text start="388.24" dur="8.31">countries like Canada the u.s. that</text>
  <text start="392.47" dur="6.57">things are changing the Bank of Canada</text>
  <text start="396.55" dur="4.83">right now they nudged up their target</text>
  <text start="399.04" dur="7.2">rate four times starting July a year ago</text>
  <text start="401.38" dur="8.55">from 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent it last</text>
  <text start="406.24" dur="5.81">hiked on July 11th but now it is facing</text>
  <text start="409.93" dur="4.71">inflation that suddenly and unexpectedly</text>
  <text start="412.05" dur="4.54">jumped at twice the Bank of Canada&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="414.64" dur="3.72">current target rate that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="416.59" dur="3.99">interesting now remember the central</text>
  <text start="418.36" dur="3.96">bankers government&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="420.58" dur="2.64">manipulating these numbers to make you</text>
  <text start="422.32" dur="3.3">feel like there&amp;#39;s no inflation</text>
  <text start="423.22" dur="4.59">whatsoever but we know there&amp;#39;s inflation</text>
  <text start="425.62" dur="4.109">we could see thin food we see it in</text>
  <text start="427.81" dur="3.89">colleges I mean they just been stuffing</text>
  <text start="429.729" dur="5.701">it in all different places</text>
  <text start="431.7" dur="6.279">Canada&amp;#39;s consumer pricing desk Index CPI</text>
  <text start="435.43" dur="4.65">rose around 3% in July from a year</text>
  <text start="437.979" dur="5.19">earlier the hottest since September of</text>
  <text start="440.08" dur="6.33">2011 statistics Canada reported on</text>
  <text start="443.169" dur="5.941">Friday that they expected about a 2.5</text>
  <text start="446.41" dur="4.86">percent rise the same as in June but it</text>
  <text start="449.11" dur="5.19">went a little bit higher than that now</text>
  <text start="451.27" dur="6.3">prices rose in all major components</text>
  <text start="454.3" dur="4.95">prices for services the largest part of</text>
  <text start="457.57" dur="3.87">consumer spending jumped around 3.2</text>
  <text start="459.25" dur="4.68">percent year-over-year up from 2.2</text>
  <text start="461.44" dur="6.57">percent increase in June and most of the</text>
  <text start="463.93" dur="8.01">provinces in Canada CPI ran even hotter</text>
  <text start="468.01" dur="8.22">Alberta&amp;#39;s 3.5 Prince Edward Island 3.4</text>
  <text start="471.94" dur="6.18">British Columbia 3.3 and so on and so</text>
  <text start="476.23" dur="2.67">forth and it was much higher than they</text>
  <text start="478.12" dur="3.3">expected</text>
  <text start="478.9" dur="5.61">now like the Fed and other central banks</text>
  <text start="481.42" dur="6.3">the Bank of Canada had its preferred</text>
  <text start="484.51" dur="6.03">measures of inflation and they&amp;#39;re a lot</text>
  <text start="487.72" dur="5.25">lower of course which is the point but</text>
  <text start="490.54" dur="4.62">unlike the Fed it does not use core</text>
  <text start="492.97" dur="5.07">index without food and energy instead it</text>
  <text start="495.16" dur="6.69">has three measures that have been</text>
  <text start="498.04" dur="7.02">statistically trimmed CPI trim CPI</text>
  <text start="501.85" dur="6.18">median and CPI common and this is how</text>
  <text start="505.06" dur="6.24">these three indices stack up in July</text>
  <text start="508.03" dur="7.2">CPI trim is 2.1 percent CPI medium is 2%</text>
  <text start="511.3" dur="6.84">CPI common is 1.9 percent and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="515.23" dur="4.89">seeing here is that they manipulate</text>
  <text start="518.14" dur="5.04">these numbers to make you think that</text>
  <text start="520.12" dur="5.67">there&amp;#39;s no inflation whatsoever but we</text>
  <text start="523.18" dur="6.24">are seeing inflation and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="525.79" dur="6.54">be a big problem and if you look at the</text>
  <text start="529.42" dur="4.65">mortgages in Canada they also have</text>
  <text start="532.33" dur="4.41">different types of mortgages they have</text>
  <text start="534.07" dur="4.2">the fixed-rate mortgage and of course it</text>
  <text start="536.74" dur="3.57">sounds like everything is fixed but</text>
  <text start="538.27" dur="4.14">that&amp;#39;s not really what it is it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="540.31" dur="5.61">not a fixed mortgage the interest rate</text>
  <text start="542.41" dur="5.85">only stays fixed for a set period such</text>
  <text start="545.92" dur="4.59">as five years and then when that period</text>
  <text start="548.26" dur="4.26">is up the rate adjusts to the current</text>
  <text start="550.51" dur="3.93">rate so those people who got a</text>
  <text start="552.52" dur="5.4">fixed-rate mortgage it&amp;#39;s not fixed</text>
  <text start="554.44" dur="5.49">forever adjustable rate mortgages well</text>
  <text start="557.92" dur="3.6">the interest rate adjusts with the moves</text>
  <text start="559.93" dur="3.75">at the banks current prime rate an</text>
  <text start="561.52" dur="4.29">increase in rate causes the monthly</text>
  <text start="563.68" dur="4.08">payment to increase variable rate</text>
  <text start="565.81" dur="3.69">mortgages the interest rate adjusts with</text>
  <text start="567.76" dur="3.51">the prime rate but the monthly payments</text>
  <text start="569.5" dur="3.84">stay the same for the term of the</text>
  <text start="571.27" dur="4.32">mortgage such as five years during that</text>
  <text start="573.34" dur="3.6">time the extra interest that is added to</text>
  <text start="575.59" dur="3.99">the payment replaces the principal</text>
  <text start="576.94" dur="5.22">portion of the payment after the term</text>
  <text start="579.58" dur="4.8">the mortgage is then renewed the</text>
  <text start="582.16" dur="3.93">remaining principal is now higher than</text>
  <text start="584.38" dur="3.33">it would have been and current rates</text>
  <text start="586.09" dur="4.17">apply so</text>
  <text start="587.71" dur="5.22">all three mortgage types and a rising</text>
  <text start="590.26" dur="5.1">interest rate environment homeowners</text>
  <text start="592.93" dur="5.06">will sooner or later face higher</text>
  <text start="595.36" dur="7.41">mortgage payments now we saw this before</text>
  <text start="597.99" dur="7.15">we saw this back in 2007 going into 2008</text>
  <text start="602.77" dur="4.65">here in the United States we are now</text>
  <text start="605.14" dur="4.62">going to see this in Canada</text>
  <text start="607.42" dur="4.68">remember the central banks have been</text>
  <text start="609.76" dur="4.05">manipulating the statistical information</text>
  <text start="612.1" dur="3.24">like inflation and governments have been</text>
  <text start="613.81" dur="3.06">manipulating this making us believe</text>
  <text start="615.34" dur="3.45">there is no inflation and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="616.87" dur="4.2">stuffing it into the stock market into</text>
  <text start="618.79" dur="5.31">health insurance into the housing market</text>
  <text start="621.07" dur="5.91">into education it&amp;#39;s been shoving it off</text>
  <text start="624.1" dur="4.92">seized but eventually what happens you</text>
  <text start="626.98" dur="3.63">can do this only for a period of time</text>
  <text start="629.02" dur="4.08">and then everything starts to break down</text>
  <text start="630.61" dur="4.71">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="633.1" dur="3.81">statistical numbers they&amp;#39;ve been that</text>
  <text start="635.32" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;ve been throwing at us they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="636.91" dur="4.08">starting to break down big time we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="638.89" dur="5.28">seeing it in housing we&amp;#39;re seeing it in</text>
  <text start="640.99" dur="5.72">retail we&amp;#39;re seeing in how people spend</text>
  <text start="644.17" dur="4.92">their money and now we&amp;#39;re seeing it in</text>
  <text start="646.71" dur="3.97">inflation we&amp;#39;re seeing it here already</text>
  <text start="649.09" dur="3.51">in the United States we&amp;#39;re seeing in</text>
  <text start="650.68" dur="3.12">Canada we&amp;#39;re gonna be seeing it out in</text>
  <text start="652.6" dur="3.18">other countries and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="653.8" dur="4.23">interesting about this all these people</text>
  <text start="655.78" dur="3.71">that have been you know getting these</text>
  <text start="658.03" dur="4.62">mortgage rates and things like that</text>
  <text start="659.49" dur="5.56">they&amp;#39;re going to be stuck once again</text>
