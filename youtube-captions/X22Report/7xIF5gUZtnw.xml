  <text start="69.649" dur="2.911">circulation when the price of silver</text>
  <text start="71.06" dur="3.69">went up and the coin itself was worth</text>

  <text start="74.75" dur="3.81">that&amp;#39;s why we don&amp;#39;t have real precious</text>

  <text start="128.84" dur="8.009">has just moved forward as we can see</text>
  <text start="132.79" dur="7.059">everyone was hoping even former Fed</text>
  <text start="136.849" dur="5.791">governors and other Fed officials came</text>
  <text start="139.849" dur="5.25">out and said listen most likely Powell&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="142.64" dur="6.66">not going to be raising rates and look</text>
  <text start="145.099" dur="6.72">what Powell did he raised rates when the</text>
  <text start="149.3" dur="6.56">mainstream media and everyone else was</text>
  <text start="151.819" dur="8.791">telling him don&amp;#39;t do it why did he do it</text>
  <text start="155.86" dur="7.32">why did he decide to raise rates Trump</text>
  <text start="160.61" dur="7.12">has been telling him not to raise rates</text>
  <text start="163.18" dur="7.29">or was he telling him to raise rates and</text>
  <text start="167.73" dur="3.88">using the idea putting it out in the</text>
  <text start="170.47" dur="4.28">mainstream media and everywhere else</text>
  <text start="171.61" dur="6.409">that he doesn&amp;#39;t want him to raise rates</text>

  <text start="178.019" dur="7.631">the Fed is controlled by Trump Trump is</text>
  <text start="183.04" dur="5.039">bringing down the fed and I don&amp;#39;t mean</text>

  <text start="190.54" dur="5.46">planned this whole entire thing out and</text>
  <text start="193.62" dur="4.869">the only way and I said this many times</text>
  <text start="196" dur="9.06">before the only way to bring down the</text>
  <text start="198.489" dur="9.84">Fed is to destroy it to make sure that</text>

  <text start="645.3" dur="7.47">if you look at this you can see that</text>
  <text start="648.17" dur="7.33">this is what the Fed wants to do 2018</text>
  <text start="652.77" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re gonna hit the median rate of</text>
  <text start="655.5" dur="4.8">about two point three seven five percent</text>
  <text start="656.85" dur="8.19">in 2019 they&amp;#39;re gonna hit two point</text>

  <text start="671.79" dur="6.15">the other Fed officials the economists</text>
  <text start="674.64" dur="5.01">they all know this is a bad idea they</text>
  <text start="677.94" dur="5.25">don&amp;#39;t want the Fed to continue because</text>
  <text start="679.65" dur="5.94">it leaves the spotlight right on them</text>
  <text start="683.19" dur="4.74">now if there was something to cover it</text>
  <text start="685.59" dur="4.2">up they wouldn&amp;#39;t care but now the</text>
  <text start="687.93" dur="3.6">spotlight is on them and Trump is</text>
  <text start="689.79" dur="4.289">continually calling them out which is</text>
  <text start="691.53" dur="4.679">going to continue to do but I think</text>
  <text start="694.079" dur="4.95">Powell said something very very</text>
  <text start="696.209" dur="6.451">interesting and this kind of sums up</text>
  <text start="699.029" dur="7.261">everything that is going on right now he</text>
  <text start="702.66" dur="7.01">said nothing will deter us from doing</text>
  <text start="706.29" dur="8.279">the right thing hmm</text>
  <text start="709.67" dur="7.75">think about what he just said from doing</text>

  <text start="729.929" dur="7.77">has told us gold is going to bring down</text>
  <text start="733.259" dur="8.3">the Fed I believe once the economy</text>
  <text start="737.699" dur="6.151">starts to fall apart once Trump</text>
  <text start="741.559" dur="5.921">completely controls the narrative and</text>
  <text start="743.85" dur="6.63">has everyone pointing to the Fed saying</text>
  <text start="747.48" dur="6.599">they are totally responsible for</text>
  <text start="750.48" dur="6.24">bringing down the economic system you</text>
  <text start="754.079" dur="4.411">will see Congress at this point they&amp;#39;ll</text>

  <text start="794.97" dur="5.059">they&amp;#39;ll make a play to audit the Fed and</text>
  <text start="797.699" dur="5.791">guess what Congress is going to do</text>
