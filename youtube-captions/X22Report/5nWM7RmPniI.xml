  <text start="59.38" dur="6.19">1620 a and today&amp;#39;s date is July 21st</text>
  <text start="62.53" dur="6.25">2018 and the Tod of the episode is the</text>
  <text start="65.57" dur="6.03">agenda is set next phase the central</text>
  <text start="68.78" dur="4.86">bank let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="71.6" dur="3.93">collapse financial news now we</text>
  <text start="73.64" dur="4.17">understand the Federal Reserve when they</text>
  <text start="75.53" dur="5.4">come out and they explain what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="77.81" dur="6.24">going to do or what they&amp;#39;re predicting</text>
  <text start="80.93" dur="6.299">it usually means the opposite I mean if</text>
  <text start="84.05" dur="5.94">we go back in time they tell us back in</text>
  <text start="87.229" dur="4.53">2008 we&amp;#39;re not predicting any type of</text>
  <text start="89.99" dur="4.29">recession and of course Ben Bernanke</text>
  <text start="91.759" dur="5.701">said this in the year 2008 when we had</text>
  <text start="94.28" dur="5.55">the recession in that same year of 2008</text>
  <text start="97.46" dur="4.53">the stock market came down and we were</text>
  <text start="99.83" dur="5.61">in a full-blown recession they also he</text>
  <text start="101.99" dur="6.269">also told us that the housing market is</text>
  <text start="105.44" dur="6.14">fine it&amp;#39;s stable housing is not going to</text>
  <text start="108.259" dur="5.941">go down subprime securities that is fine</text>
  <text start="111.58" dur="4.24">corporations there looking good and it</text>
  <text start="114.2" dur="3.119">turned out that everything was</text>
  <text start="115.82" dur="4.29">completely the opposite of what they</text>
  <text start="117.319" dur="6.031">were telling us now the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="120.11" dur="6.63">chair Jerome Powell is out there saying</text>
  <text start="123.35" dur="5.79">that digital assets are not yet big</text>
  <text start="126.74" dur="5.46">enough to present a serious threat to</text>
  <text start="129.14" dur="7.59">financial stability and what he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="132.2" dur="7.56">is that the Fed they are not considering</text>
  <text start="136.73" dur="4.95">digital currency whatsoever now we know</text>
  <text start="139.76" dur="5.01">this is completely fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="141.68" dur="5.16">because they&amp;#39;re looking to put forward</text>
  <text start="144.77" dur="4.11">their own digital currency it might not</text>
  <text start="146.84" dur="4.74">be cryptocurrency which I think this is</text>
  <text start="148.88" dur="4.17">where they would like to go but I think</text>
  <text start="151.58" dur="3.27">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do and this is</text>
  <text start="153.05" dur="5.28">why they were pushing Cancer Society</text>
  <text start="154.85" dur="6.17">they were going to a fully digital type</text>
  <text start="158.33" dur="4.71">of currency and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="161.02" dur="4.24">cryptocurrency was becoming more and</text>
  <text start="163.04" dur="4.2">more popular now cryptocurrency is very</text>
  <text start="165.26" dur="3.059">very small right now and of course what</text>
  <text start="167.24" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re saying is that you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="168.319" dur="4.081">it&amp;#39;s volatile many people many</text>
  <text start="170.63" dur="3.15">corporations are not taking payments in</text>
  <text start="172.4" dur="3.84">it yet and again this is the beginning</text>
  <text start="173.78" dur="5.55">stages this is cryptocurrency blockchain</text>
  <text start="176.24" dur="5.46">1.0 just like the internet if you go</text>
  <text start="179.33" dur="5.73">back in time when we had you know flip</text>
  <text start="181.7" dur="4.48">phones when we had AOL dial-up you know</text>
  <text start="185.06" dur="3.129">no one would ever thought</text>
  <text start="186.18" dur="4.02">but that would be doing so much on the</text>
  <text start="188.189" dur="4.55">Internet where would be actually</text>
  <text start="190.2" dur="4.53">accessing the Internet on our phones</text>
  <text start="192.739" dur="6.431">these little devices that we carry</text>
  <text start="194.73" dur="5.94">around now and once again this is just</text>
  <text start="199.17" dur="5.159">the beginning stages of cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="200.67" dur="6.03">and he went on to say that even the Fed</text>
  <text start="204.329" dur="5.071">coin has received little interest from</text>
  <text start="206.7" dur="4.319">the Fed and they&amp;#39;re not looking to move</text>
  <text start="209.4" dur="4.319">to cryptocurrencies which I think the</text>
  <text start="211.019" dur="4.981">opposite is about to happen there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="213.719" dur="5.1">reason why they demonize cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="216" dur="5.37">so much is there&amp;#39;s a reason why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="218.819" dur="4.081">been telling us that it&amp;#39;s volatile you</text>
  <text start="221.37" dur="3.269">know money laundering and everything but</text>
  <text start="222.9" dur="4.259">you know the dollar and other currencies</text>
  <text start="224.639" dur="5.401">they&amp;#39;re used for money laundering and</text>
  <text start="227.159" dur="4.41">everything else and what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="230.04" dur="3.179">trying to do is they&amp;#39;ve been trying to</text>
  <text start="231.569" dur="3.991">keep the American people in the world</text>
  <text start="233.219" dur="5.1">off track of what crypto currencies on</text>
  <text start="235.56" dur="5.099">the blockchain really are and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="238.319" dur="5.64">seeing is now IBM they&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="240.659" dur="5.791">hook a coin to the dollar and I believe</text>
  <text start="243.959" dur="4.26">in the background as always they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="246.45" dur="4.23">gonna be moving their agenda forward</text>
  <text start="248.219" dur="5.19">while they&amp;#39;re telling us that this</text>
  <text start="250.68" dur="5.64">really isn&amp;#39;t important to them which we</text>
  <text start="253.409" dur="5.101">know this is completely the opposite now</text>
  <text start="256.32" dur="3.96">we know that the global economy right</text>
  <text start="258.51" dur="4.11">now it has so much debt the United</text>
  <text start="260.28" dur="6.15">States has so much debt and the last</text>
  <text start="262.62" dur="7.769">time the US completely paid off the</text>
  <text start="266.43" dur="7.47">national debt was in 1840 it was the</text>
  <text start="270.389" dur="6.571">result of decades of balanced budgets</text>
  <text start="273.9" dur="7.35">under President James Monroe John Quincy</text>
  <text start="276.96" dur="6.5">Adams and Andrew Jackson in the hundred</text>
  <text start="281.25" dur="4.289">and seventy-nine years since 1840</text>
  <text start="283.46" dur="5.65">counting the 2018 budget</text>
  <text start="285.539" dur="6.391">the US has run a deficit a hundred and</text>
  <text start="289.11" dur="6.239">nine times and a surplus or balanced</text>
  <text start="291.93" dur="6.06">budget just 70 times amounting to a</text>
  <text start="295.349" dur="5.011">cumulative net deficit of fourteen point</text>
  <text start="297.99" dur="4.59">two trillion all of these surpluses</text>
  <text start="300.36" dur="5.1">combined in the last 179 years amount to</text>
  <text start="302.58" dur="5.07">about 580 billion less than the deficit</text>
  <text start="305.46" dur="5.13">in 2017 alone which was six hundred and</text>
  <text start="307.65" dur="6.629">six five billion since the national debt</text>
  <text start="310.59" dur="5.639">was last eliminated in 1840 the US has</text>
  <text start="314.279" dur="3.601">paid a cumulative seven point eight</text>
  <text start="316.229" dur="2.591">trillion of interest on the national</text>
  <text start="317.88" dur="2.71">debt</text>
  <text start="318.82" dur="5.16">this interest includes repaying</text>
  <text start="320.59" dur="5.37">principal and if we use arithmetic here</text>
  <text start="323.98" dur="5.97">not common core arithmetic real</text>
  <text start="325.96" dur="6.06">arithmetic it reveals that 55% of the 14</text>
  <text start="329.95" dur="5.07">port trillion in deficit spending since</text>
  <text start="332.02" dur="5.58">1840 has an effect gone toward servicing</text>
  <text start="335.02" dur="4.23">the national debt and if we look at this</text>
  <text start="337.6" dur="4.29">a little differently instead of paying</text>
  <text start="339.25" dur="3.87">down its that what tax revenue the</text>
  <text start="341.89" dur="3.42">federal government has essentially</text>
  <text start="343.12" dur="5.94">rolled over 55 percent of its debt since</text>
  <text start="345.31" dur="5.79">1840 with new debt and as the debt</text>
  <text start="349.06" dur="4.29">continually grows the tax receipts</text>
  <text start="351.1" dur="4.68">coming in the ability to pay off the</text>
  <text start="353.35" dur="5.64">debt is becoming harder and harder if</text>
  <text start="355.78" dur="5.73">you raise interest rates well it&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="358.99" dur="5.16">much harder now we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="361.51" dur="4.98">how both sides and I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="364.15" dur="5.7">central bank and the Patriots behind</text>
  <text start="366.49" dur="6.81">Trump how they are both going to create</text>
  <text start="369.85" dur="5.76">a certain narrative when the system</text>
  <text start="373.3" dur="5.01">comes apart and what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="375.61" dur="4.41">before that period of time they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="378.31" dur="3.84">to lay pred crumbs just like the Fed</text>
  <text start="380.02" dur="4.32">right now they&amp;#39;re changing data hiding</text>
  <text start="382.15" dur="3.45">data they have the mainstream media out</text>
  <text start="384.34" dur="4.11">there saying that we&amp;#39;re heading towards</text>
  <text start="385.6" dur="5.43">a recession most likely before 2020 the</text>
  <text start="388.45" dur="6.3">economy isn&amp;#39;t as good as Trump the IMF</text>
  <text start="391.03" dur="5.97">is out there saying that the trade war</text>
  <text start="394.75" dur="4.56">is going to hurt the economy the Fed is</text>
  <text start="397" dur="5.7">out there saying yes the trade war might</text>
  <text start="399.31" dur="5.61">wreck the economy so on one side you</text>
  <text start="402.7" dur="4.65">have the central bank you have the</text>
  <text start="404.92" dur="5.01">corporate media the deep state they are</text>
  <text start="407.35" dur="5.37">pushing a certain agenda of how the</text>
  <text start="409.93" dur="4.83">economy is going to go in the future and</text>
  <text start="412.72" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re already letting the breadcrumbs</text>
  <text start="414.76" dur="4.89">of saying that it&amp;#39;s because of Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="417.25" dur="4.92">trade policies now we talked about how</text>
  <text start="419.65" dur="5.7">Trump was going to come out and say</text>
  <text start="422.17" dur="6.03">something against the central bank the</text>
  <text start="425.35" dur="5.97">Fed and he came out and we mentioned</text>
  <text start="428.2" dur="5.55">this in a previous report where he said</text>
  <text start="431.32" dur="5.19">he&amp;#39;s not thrilled or happy with the</text>
  <text start="433.75" dur="5.28">interest rate hikes he knows and the</text>
  <text start="436.51" dur="6.3">patriots know exactly what the central</text>
  <text start="439.03" dur="7.92">bank is up to and if you really think</text>
  <text start="442.81" dur="6.84">about it presidents rarely ever comment</text>
  <text start="446.95" dur="5.66">on monetary policy or currency market</text>
  <text start="449.65" dur="5.569">moves at all they don&amp;#39;t even go</text>
  <text start="452.61" dur="5.399">the Fed for Trump to come out and say</text>
  <text start="455.219" dur="6.42">this it seems like he&amp;#39;s letting everyone</text>
  <text start="458.009" dur="5.851">know that he&amp;#39;s not happy with what the</text>
  <text start="461.639" dur="5.37">Fed is doing where they&amp;#39;re raising</text>
  <text start="463.86" dur="4.92">interest rates and he kind of summed it</text>
  <text start="467.009" dur="4.951">up when he was having this interview</text>
  <text start="468.78" dur="6.8">with CNBC where he said the following</text>
  <text start="471.96" dur="6.9">and this basically lays out the</text>
  <text start="475.58" dur="7.54">groundwork for his narrative and how</text>
  <text start="478.86" dur="6.179">he&amp;#39;s setting up the central bank I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="483.12" dur="5.34">necessarily agree with it</text>
  <text start="485.039" dur="5.791">Trump said to CNBC about the feds to</text>
  <text start="488.46" dur="4.229">rate hikes so far this year I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="490.83" dur="4.589">thrilled because every time we go up</text>
  <text start="492.689" dur="5.461">they want to raise the rates again but</text>
  <text start="495.419" dur="7.62">at the same time I&amp;#39;m letting them do</text>
  <text start="498.15" dur="8.879">what they feel is best think about what</text>
  <text start="503.039" dur="6.93">he&amp;#39;s saying here and what he just did he</text>
  <text start="507.029" dur="5.64">let the world know he&amp;#39;s not happy with</text>
  <text start="509.969" dur="4.8">what they&amp;#39;re doing raising interest</text>
  <text start="512.669" dur="6.331">rates he wants them to raise it again</text>
  <text start="514.769" dur="6.81">and again and again and he&amp;#39;s saying I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="519" dur="7.589">letting them do what they feel is best</text>
  <text start="521.579" dur="7.231">he just set up the central bank he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="526.589" dur="5.631">letting everyone know that they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="528.81" dur="7.019">ones who were doing this now later on</text>
  <text start="532.22" dur="5.47">he&amp;#39;s going to come out with more Nuggets</text>
  <text start="535.829" dur="3.12">now of course the White House is gonna</text>
  <text start="537.69" dur="3.75">say no this is not what it really means</text>
  <text start="538.949" dur="5.401">and this is how the game is played this</text>
  <text start="541.44" dur="6.899">whole thing is a game on how you can</text>
  <text start="544.35" dur="7.28">manipulate what is going on in the</text>
  <text start="548.339" dur="6.151">market geopolitically politically and</text>
  <text start="551.63" dur="6.19">get the deep state get the central bank</text>
  <text start="554.49" dur="4.89">sucked into a certain narrative and this</text>
  <text start="557.82" dur="4.05">is what he&amp;#39;s been trying to do and the</text>
  <text start="559.38" dur="3.899">page has been trying to do all along so</text>
  <text start="561.87" dur="6.26">what we&amp;#39;re going to see moving forward</text>
  <text start="563.279" dur="7.771">here is many more how should I say</text>
  <text start="568.13" dur="6.01">messages coming out of Trump and the</text>
  <text start="571.05" dur="8.399">Patriots remember the last time the</text>
  <text start="574.14" dur="8.25">national day was paid off was in 1840</text>
  <text start="579.449" dur="5.101">and that was President James Monroe John</text>
  <text start="582.39" dur="3.79">Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson Andrew</text>
  <text start="584.55" dur="3.7">Jackson ran</text>
  <text start="586.18" dur="5.7">campaign on getting rid of the central</text>
  <text start="588.25" dur="6.12">bank the central bank puts the country</text>
  <text start="591.88" dur="5.79">into debt how do they do this they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="594.37" dur="7.44">own the government currency with</text>
  <text start="597.67" dur="7.56">interest attached we don&amp;#39;t need to have</text>
  <text start="601.81" dur="5.07">a central bank doing that and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="605.23" dur="4.26">trying to convince us the central bank</text>
  <text start="606.88" dur="4.62">the Fed that they need to control the</text>
  <text start="609.49" dur="3.45">economy because they help the dollar</text>
  <text start="611.5" dur="3.839">they help the interest rates they help</text>
  <text start="612.94" dur="4.98">the economy stay stable but if you look</text>
  <text start="615.339" dur="5.641">back in time how many times have has the</text>
  <text start="617.92" dur="5.22">economy fallen apart where we entered a</text>
  <text start="620.98" dur="5.1">recession and depression and people have</text>
  <text start="623.14" dur="5.19">lost their wealth as the dollar really</text>
  <text start="626.08" dur="4.77">maintained its value no it&amp;#39;s gone down</text>
  <text start="628.33" dur="5.22">in value over time it&amp;#39;s now nine worth</text>
  <text start="630.85" dur="5.489">ninety six ninety seven percent what of</text>
  <text start="633.55" dur="4.62">what it was worth back in 1913 when they</text>
  <text start="636.339" dur="4.431">first introduced it especially when we</text>
  <text start="638.17" dur="6.45">came off the gold standard in 1970 so</text>
  <text start="640.77" dur="7.66">right now we are now seeing the first</text>
  <text start="644.62" dur="6.839">shots of this battle and Trump finally</text>
  <text start="648.43" dur="5.22">came out and pointed towards the Fed</text>
  <text start="651.459" dur="3.301">because he understands and just like we</text>
  <text start="653.65" dur="3">understand this is why we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="654.76" dur="4.89">following the economy this is why we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="656.65" dur="4.77">been tracking every little thing looking</text>
  <text start="659.65" dur="5.01">at all the different indicators so</text>
  <text start="661.42" dur="5.07">nobody could say hey all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="664.66" dur="4.14">economy came down it was because of this</text>
  <text start="666.49" dur="4.17">reason no we&amp;#39;ve been following it and</text>
  <text start="668.8" dur="4.74">we&amp;#39;ve been showing how these numbers</text>
  <text start="670.66" dur="6.679">give us the illusion that the economy</text>
  <text start="673.54" dur="7.23">was doing well when it really wasn&amp;#39;t and</text>
  <text start="677.339" dur="6.341">what we&amp;#39;re in today is it&amp;#39;s not a strong</text>
  <text start="680.77" dur="5.28">economy the stress test that the Fed</text>
