  <text start="241.56" dur="5.07">about improving the country this is</text>
  <text start="243.989" dur="5.431">about making the people suffer going in</text>
  <text start="246.63" dur="4.77">and buying up the country&amp;#39;s assets for</text>
  <text start="249.42" dur="5.909">the worse was paper well actually it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="251.4" dur="6.119">digital currency now zeros and ones and</text>
  <text start="255.329" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re going to get the ports they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="260.789" dur="5.041">rail stations they&amp;#39;re going to get all</text>
  <text start="262.56" dur="6.15">of this and this is what central banks</text>
  <text start="265.83" dur="5.04">do private western central banks this is</text>
  <text start="268.71" dur="5.42">what they do because they are private</text>
  <text start="270.87" dur="8.03">and their prop their their product is</text>
  <text start="274.13" dur="8.11">debt put the country into debt and steal</text>
  <text start="278.9" dur="5.59">whatever they have here in the United</text>
  <text start="282.24" dur="5.33">States we are seeing that over the last</text>
  <text start="284.49" dur="6.81">eight years that Obama was in office</text>
  <text start="287.57" dur="8.969">well his plan to spread the wealth</text>
  <text start="291.3" dur="7.53">around to everyone well it didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="296.539" dur="5.231">the data from the US bureau of labor</text>
  <text start="298.83" dur="6.63">statistics reveals he failed miserably</text>
  <text start="301.77" dur="6.75">in fact as Bloomberg points out not only</text>
  <text start="305.46" dur="6.24">did income inequality not decline under</text>
  <text start="308.52" dur="6.06">Obama&amp;#39;s ring it actually surged to</text>
  <text start="311.7" dur="5.67">multi-decade highs with people in the</text>
  <text start="314.58" dur="5.73">90th percentile of all earners bringing</text>
  <text start="317.37" dur="6.349">home over five times the amount paid to</text>
  <text start="320.31" dur="6.53">the people in the 10th percentile</text>
  <text start="323.719" dur="6.7">low-income wages have been stagnant</text>
  <text start="326.84" dur="5.5">since the 70s and despite Obama&amp;#39;s valve</text>
  <text start="330.419" dur="5.191">to spread the wealth around real wages</text>
  <text start="332.34" dur="6.12">for the poor actually suffered under his</text>
  <text start="335.61" dur="5.1">presidency it did not help whatsoever</text>
  <text start="338.46" dur="4.32">and we see the market continually moving</text>
  <text start="340.71" dur="3.179">up and up and up and up and people and</text>
  <text start="342.78" dur="2.789">of course the corporate media is out</text>
  <text start="343.889" dur="4.83">there saying wow look at this look at</text>
  <text start="345.569" dur="4.65">the cow it&amp;#39;s a 20,000 and Wall Street is</text>
  <text start="348.719" dur="6.021">celebrating and everyone thinks is a</text>
  <text start="350.219" dur="9.57">fantastic despite the market moving up</text>
  <text start="354.74" dur="8.26">guess what the wealthiest ten percent of</text>
  <text start="359.789" dur="6">households own roughly eighty percent of</text>
  <text start="363" dur="5.37">the stock market wealth so the rest of</text>
  <text start="365.789" dur="4.711">the people they&amp;#39;re not benefitting from</text>
  <text start="368.37" dur="5.13">any of this most of the Americans don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="370.5" dur="5.58">benefit from this whatsoever this is the</text>
  <text start="373.5" dur="6.18">insiders this is the central bank</text>
  <text start="376.08" dur="7.739">propping it up and it&amp;#39;s good for</text>
  <text start="379.68" dur="5.489">publicity it&amp;#39;s good to show that the</text>
  <text start="383.819" dur="3.21">economy is doing well and this has</text>
  <text start="385.169" dur="3.541">nothing to do with the economy we have</text>
  <text start="387.029" dur="5.13">the stock market and then we have the</text>
  <text start="388.71" dur="6.72">real economy two separate things now we</text>
  <text start="392.159" dur="5.461">see durable goods well the soft data was</text>
  <text start="395.43" dur="6.47">completely wrong the hard data came in</text>
  <text start="397.62" dur="7.919">and durable goods well it was a disaster</text>
  <text start="401.9" dur="7.299">analysts expected about 2.5% surge in</text>
  <text start="405.539" dur="5.461">new orders in December and guess what it</text>
  <text start="409.199" dur="4.321">was absolutely awful it came down</text>
  <text start="411" dur="5.729">negative point four percent and a</text>
  <text start="413.52" dur="7.59">year-on-year was negative point eight</text>
  <text start="416.729" dur="5.31">percent this is absolutely awful because</text>
  <text start="421.11" dur="3">they thought it was just going to</text>
  <text start="422.039" dur="5.761">continually move up and up and up now</text>
  <text start="424.11" dur="5.07">today we saw the headlines come out for</text>
  <text start="427.8" dur="3.75">GDP they were released for the fourth</text>
  <text start="429.18" dur="5.099">quarter and the corporate media is out</text>
  <text start="431.55" dur="5.339">there they are spinning this any which</text>
  <text start="434.279" dur="4.38">way they can some of the headlines our</text>
  <text start="436.889" dur="4.83">US economy expands at one point nine</text>
  <text start="438.659" dur="5.57">percent gdp is up by one point nine</text>
  <text start="441.719" dur="5.25">percent for the fourth quarter and</text>
  <text start="444.229" dur="3.91">they&amp;#39;re spitting this to make it sound</text>
  <text start="446.969" dur="3.091">like the economy</text>
  <text start="448.139" dur="5.03">is actually doing well and this was</text>
  <text start="450.06" dur="6.84">under Obama so look how great it&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="453.169" dur="5.141">well how can it be up because the</text>
  <text start="456.9" dur="2.879">previous quarter was a three-point-five</text>
  <text start="458.31" dur="4.62">percent if we use their manipulated</text>
  <text start="459.779" dur="6.51">numbers so actually it&amp;#39;s down and we can</text>
  <text start="462.93" dur="5.069">see right now that the GDP numbers they</text>
  <text start="466.289" dur="4.951">are completely manipulated they have</text>
  <text start="467.999" dur="5.82">been for a very long time prior to the</text>
  <text start="471.24" dur="5.429">election the gdp was forced up to two</text>
  <text start="473.819" dur="5.791">point nine percent because of exporting</text>
  <text start="476.669" dur="4.351">soybeans then they revised the number at</text>
  <text start="479.61" dur="4.919">the election to make it three point five</text>
  <text start="481.02" dur="8.459">percent and we can see from shadow stats</text>
  <text start="484.529" dur="7.711">the real GDP numbers well they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="489.479" dur="6.12">in the negative range so the entire year</text>
  <text start="492.24" dur="7.56">of 2016 the GDP number is one point six</text>
  <text start="495.599" dur="5.57">percent to have firm growth you need to</text>
  <text start="499.8" dur="5.539">be around three percent actually</text>
  <text start="501.169" dur="8.49">President Obama was the first president</text>
  <text start="505.339" dur="8.83">not to have one year of three percent</text>
  <text start="509.659" dur="8.38">gdp growth eight years as president did</text>
  <text start="514.169" dur="8.49">not have one year what does that tell</text>
  <text start="518.039" dur="7.29">you that tells you that we never had any</text>
  <text start="522.659" dur="4.891">type of recovery there was no recovery</text>
  <text start="525.329" dur="4.771">the whole thing was a complete illusion</text>
  <text start="527.55" dur="4.77">and to keep this illusion alive they had</text>
  <text start="530.1" dur="4.679">to manipulate this number because the</text>
  <text start="532.32" dur="3.99">real GDP number is in the negative range</text>
  <text start="534.779" dur="4.05">actually I think a shadow side ties it</text>
  <text start="536.31" dur="6.6">around negative point two percent that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="538.829" dur="6.601">how bad it is and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="542.91" dur="6">that all of this is starting to fall</text>
  <text start="545.43" dur="5.969">apart the illusion is melting away and</text>
  <text start="548.91" dur="4.859">reality is coming through right now and</text>
  <text start="551.399" dur="6.091">as we move forward we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="553.769" dur="5.19">more reality come through where these</text>
  <text start="557.49" dur="2.909">numbers are not going to be what</text>
  <text start="558.959" dur="5.461">everyone is talking about they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="560.399" dur="5.641">to be actually a lot worse now I know</text>
  <text start="564.42" dur="4.289">the Fed they&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="566.04" dur="5.85">deflation they&amp;#39;re very afraid of this</text>
  <text start="568.709" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re also afraid of inflation well we</text>
  <text start="571.89" dur="4.86">see Atlanta&amp;#39;s fed deflation</text>
  <text start="573.149" dur="5.67">probabilities index well it looks like</text>
  <text start="576.75" dur="4.11">there is no deflation because according</text>
  <text start="578.819" dur="3.031">to Atlanta Fed deflation probabilities</text>
  <text start="580.86" dur="5.37">indicator it</text>
  <text start="581.85" dur="6.479">fallin 20 percent so what we can see</text>
  <text start="586.23" dur="4.049">right now is say hello to inflation</text>
  <text start="588.329" dur="3.661">because that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s coming they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="590.279" dur="4.471">been hiding inflation they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="591.99" dur="5.37">shipping inflation out to the emerging</text>
  <text start="594.75" dur="4.85">markets and we&amp;#39;re going to see all of</text>
  <text start="597.36" dur="4.919">this come back to the United States now</text>
  <text start="599.6" dur="5.38">everyone needs to get ready and prepared</text>
  <text start="602.279" dur="5.31">for the real estate bubble to pop we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="604.98" dur="6.33">already seeing the housing market</text>
  <text start="607.589" dur="5.761">tremble as real estate as our interest</text>
  <text start="611.31" dur="3.329">rates move up just a little bit we see</text>
  <text start="613.35" dur="3.09">mortgage applications they just</text>
  <text start="614.639" dur="3.601">completely imploded on themselves and</text>
  <text start="616.44" dur="3.959">we&amp;#39;re looking around and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="618.24" dur="3.45">that housing prices not in the 20 cities</text>
  <text start="620.399" dur="2.731">but everywhere else you know the</text>
  <text start="621.69" dur="3.959">hundreds and hundreds of other cities</text>
  <text start="623.13" dur="5.459">that the real estate prices are starting</text>
  <text start="625.649" dur="6.99">to come down dramatically and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="628.589" dur="6.721">seeing is that this entire market was</text>
  <text start="632.639" dur="4.351">propped up by keeping house was off the</text>
  <text start="635.31" dur="3.57">market the banks were instructed to keep</text>
  <text start="636.99" dur="4.17">houses off the market when they</text>
  <text start="638.88" dur="4.709">foreclosed hedge funds investment</text>
  <text start="641.16" dur="4.979">companies foreign investment or coming</text>
  <text start="643.589" dur="4.081">in and buying up a lot of homes a lot of</text>
  <text start="646.139" dur="3.481">them didn&amp;#39;t sell it they just kept them</text>
  <text start="647.67" dur="4.08">off the market may be rented them if</text>
  <text start="649.62" dur="6.719">they could but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="651.75" dur="6.209">now is that the Chinese funds that were</text>
  <text start="656.339" dur="2.67">coming in the foreign investment that</text>
  <text start="657.959" dur="2.521">was coming into the United States</text>
  <text start="659.009" dur="4.051">because they were taking their their</text>
  <text start="660.48" dur="4.529">currency from China and spending in here</text>
  <text start="663.06" dur="3.6">in the United States not just the United</text>

  <text start="668.79" dur="6.06">estate boom well it&amp;#39;s coming to an end</text>
  <text start="671.1" dur="8.37">why because China just implemented</text>
  <text start="674.85" dur="6.63">capital controls and what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="679.47" dur="4.049">right now is saying that they cannot</text>
  <text start="681.48" dur="4.74">take their currency outside of the</text>

  <text start="800.85" dur="6.45">cashless society and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="803.279" dur="5.701">right now is that things are not what</text>
  <text start="807.3" dur="3.72">they seem even though the stock market</text>
  <text start="808.98" dur="8.76">is continually moving up corporate</text>
  <text start="811.02" dur="11.27">profits sales revenue everything that</text>
  <text start="817.74" dur="7.52">makes up an economy it&amp;#39;s going one way</text>

  <text start="830.029" dur="6.611">GDP is declining the dow is moving up</text>
  <text start="834.209" dur="5.311">there&amp;#39;s a disconnect right now and</text>
  <text start="836.64" dur="4.65">that&amp;#39;s going to come to an end remember</text>
  <text start="839.52" dur="4.13">when Janet Yellen said that she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="841.29" dur="4.44">worried about the economy overheating</text>
  <text start="843.65" dur="3.49">you know because GDP got to</text>
  <text start="845.73" dur="3.18">two-point-nine percent before the</text>
  <text start="847.14" dur="2.27">election unemployment dropped quite a</text>
  <text start="848.91" dur="3.349">bit</text>
  <text start="849.41" dur="4.71">well that was all a lie because the</text>
  <text start="852.259" dur="4.13">overall GDP if the economy is one point</text>
  <text start="854.12" dur="6.87">six percent where is it heating up</text>
  <text start="856.389" dur="10.211">there&amp;#39;s no heating up of the economy the</text>
  <text start="860.99" dur="7.289">economy flat and we all knew this so</text>
  <text start="866.6" dur="6.39">what we&amp;#39;re looking at is that the</text>
  <text start="868.279" dur="6.6">central bank was lying to the people so</text>
  <text start="872.99" dur="4.26">let&amp;#39;s run down the last eight years in</text>
  <text start="874.879" dur="9.39">numbers since 2009 the u.s. debt has</text>
  <text start="877.25" dur="9.019">risen by nine trillion dollars and Obama</text>
  <text start="884.269" dur="6.51">says that he created 11 million jobs</text>
  <text start="886.269" dur="7.99">well most of them were part-time most of</text>
  <text start="890.779" dur="5.67">them were government jobs and if you</text>
  <text start="894.259" dur="4.651">look at this and we know that a lot of</text>
  <text start="896.449" dur="7.2">its manipulated when you look at this</text>
  <text start="898.91" dur="10.109">you can see that it costs nine hundred</text>
  <text start="903.649" dur="8.911">thousand dollars for each job if we go</text>
  <text start="909.019" dur="6.75">with his numbers so the government spent</text>
  <text start="912.56" dur="7.32">nine hundred thousand dollars to create</text>
  <text start="915.769" dur="5.94">each one of those jobs because when you</text>
  <text start="919.88" dur="3.93">calculate it out you have nine trillion</text>
  <text start="921.709" dur="5.43">dollars worth of debt you have 11</text>
  <text start="923.81" dur="6.75">million jobs and that&amp;#39;s how much they</text>
  <text start="927.139" dur="8.221">spent it&amp;#39;s ridiculous and these jobs are</text>
  <text start="930.56" dur="8.31">part-time so what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="935.36" dur="5.789">this entire economy it went absolutely</text>
  <text start="938.87" dur="4.649">nowhere it&amp;#39;s been flat for eight years</text>
  <text start="941.149" dur="3.87">actually in the background behind all</text>
  <text start="943.519" dur="4.021">the manipulated numbers it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="945.019" dur="6.87">declining so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="947.54" dur="7.89">is that things are rapidly being</text>
  <text start="951.889" dur="5.31">stripped away the numbers like the</text>
  <text start="955.43" dur="4.829">initial jobless claims the continuous</text>
  <text start="957.199" dur="7.26">claims real estate new construction</text>
  <text start="960.259" dur="7.171">declining stores are shutting down the</text>
  <text start="964.459" dur="5.271">debt can&amp;#39;t be sustained I mean</text>
  <text start="967.43" dur="4.949">everything is hitting all at once and</text>
  <text start="969.73" dur="5.049">they&amp;#39;re starting to recognize that there</text>
  <text start="972.379" dur="6.351">is a problem that there&amp;#39;s a major</text>
  <text start="974.779" dur="6.691">problem I mean the storm used to be off</text>
  <text start="978.73" dur="3.65">the coast you could see it in the</text>
  <text start="981.47" dur="3.37">distance</text>
  <text start="982.38" dur="6">then the store move much much closer</text>
  <text start="984.84" dur="8.25">closer to the shore now the storm is</text>
  <text start="988.38" dur="8.06">almost on top of us and it&amp;#39;s approaching</text>
  <text start="993.09" dur="5.73">very very quickly so at this point</text>
  <text start="996.44" dur="5.14">people really need to start to get</text>
  <text start="998.82" dur="5.49">prepared and ready because we can see</text>
  <text start="1001.58" dur="4.23">that the elite well it&amp;#39;s either they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1004.31" dur="3.72">going to bring down the economy in their</text>
  <text start="1005.81" dur="6.03">way or Trump is going to beat them to it</text>
  <text start="1008.03" dur="6.15">and do it his way and we can see there</text>
  <text start="1011.84" dur="5.73">is a battle going on between these two</text>
  <text start="1014.18" dur="6.36">forces but there&amp;#39;s one constant in all</text>
  <text start="1017.57" dur="6.21">of this is that the economy needs to</text>
  <text start="1020.54" dur="5.49">come down we need a reset and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1023.78" dur="3.9">going to see it listen everyone thanks a</text>
  <text start="1026.03" dur="5.659">lot for listening be well be safe and</text>
