  <text start="33.56" dur="4.59">report my name is dave and this is</text>
  <text start="35.39" dur="6.03">episode 731 and today&amp;#39;s date is July</text>
  <text start="38.15" dur="5.339">thirty-first 2015 and the title this</text>
  <text start="41.42" dur="5.43">episode is US government is flat broke</text>
  <text start="43.489" dur="5.491">and the fallout will not end well let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="46.85" dur="4.41">get right into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="48.98" dur="5.94">news now we understand at this point in</text>
  <text start="51.26" dur="6.27">time Europe is not recovering whatsoever</text>
  <text start="54.92" dur="4.56">yes the central bankers can come out and</text>
  <text start="57.53" dur="6.77">tell us that they see an incredible</text>
  <text start="59.48" dur="11.37">improvement inflation is holding steady</text>
  <text start="64.3" dur="9.64">unemployment is right now steady at 11.1</text>
  <text start="70.85" dur="7.5">percent it&amp;#39;s unchanged and it&amp;#39;s looking</text>
  <text start="73.94" dur="6.33">good but what we look closer at this we</text>
  <text start="78.35" dur="4.59">see there are certain countries that are</text>
  <text start="80.27" dur="5.61">ticking up a little bit and their</text>
  <text start="82.94" dur="8.52">unemployment rate is increasing take for</text>
  <text start="85.88" dur="8.04">example Italy Italy unexpectedly their</text>
  <text start="91.46" dur="4.199">unemployment rate rose to twelve point</text>
  <text start="93.92" dur="6.9">seven percent from twelve point five</text>
  <text start="95.659" dur="10.411">percent and we see that the the youth</text>
  <text start="100.82" dur="8.58">unemployment surprisingly jumped nearly</text>
  <text start="106.07" dur="9.75">two percent higher than it was now it is</text>
  <text start="109.4" dur="9.509">at 44.2 percent a record level and we</text>
  <text start="115.82" dur="6.9">can see that they rival other countries</text>
  <text start="118.909" dur="9.661">like Spain and Greece so when we look at</text>
  <text start="122.72" dur="10.17">this entire situation the eurozone is</text>
  <text start="128.57" dur="11.49">not recovering whatsoever I mean Greece</text>
  <text start="132.89" dur="11.31">is at basically 25% Spain 22% Cyprus</text>
  <text start="140.06" dur="6.39">sixteen percent Croatia fifteen percent</text>
  <text start="144.2" dur="7.67">Italy twelve percent Portugal twelve</text>
  <text start="146.45" dur="11.4">percent and it goes on this tells us</text>
  <text start="151.87" dur="9.579">something is not right the austerity on</text>
  <text start="157.85" dur="5.699">the people not working more people you</text>
  <text start="161.449" dur="2.461">put out of work less revenue comes into</text>
  <text start="163.549" dur="3.541">the gov</text>
  <text start="163.91" dur="5.25">in which means they have to get rid of</text>
  <text start="167.09" dur="4.29">more people which is more austerity they</text>
  <text start="169.16" dur="4.65">need to take on more debt to pay their</text>
  <text start="171.38" dur="3.96">bills and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="173.81" dur="6.35">throughout the Europe throughout the</text>
  <text start="175.34" dur="7.68">eurozone and it&amp;#39;s not just the eurozone</text>
  <text start="180.16" dur="7.47">we see this is happening in other places</text>
  <text start="183.02" dur="8.43">like Canada the Canadian economy</text>
  <text start="187.63" dur="6.73">continued to contract in May amid a</text>
  <text start="191.45" dur="4.83">broad-based decline in output and this</text>
  <text start="194.36" dur="5.25">data was released by the statistics of</text>
  <text start="196.28" dur="6.63">canada on friday the real gross domestic</text>
  <text start="199.61" dur="5.94">product shrank by point2 percent in the</text>
  <text start="202.91" dur="5.04">month a worse than expected to climb the</text>
  <text start="205.55" dur="5.7">contraction represents the fifth month</text>
  <text start="207.95" dur="7.2">in a row that the economic activity has</text>
  <text start="211.25" dur="5.64">receded and six of the last seven adding</text>
  <text start="215.15" dur="5.34">to overwhelming evidence that yeah</text>
  <text start="216.89" dur="7.32">Canada has now slipped into another</text>
  <text start="220.49" dur="7.59">recession real factory output declined</text>
  <text start="224.21" dur="7.44">by one point seven percent what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="228.08" dur="4.89">seeing right now is a domino effect now</text>
  <text start="231.65" dur="4.95">starting to hit each one of these</text>
  <text start="232.97" dur="5.76">countries now of course our leaders the</text>
  <text start="236.6" dur="4.2">central banks are going to continually</text>
  <text start="238.73" dur="5.07">tell us that no everything is fine they</text>
  <text start="240.8" dur="4.74">have it contained and this is a word</text>
  <text start="243.8" dur="5.04">they like to use to let everyone know</text>
  <text start="245.54" dur="6.96">that everything is fine basically all</text>
  <text start="248.84" dur="6.18">does is it tricks you into thinking that</text>
  <text start="252.5" dur="7.43">everything is fine when we know it is</text>
  <text start="255.02" dur="8.01">not we see here in the United States</text>
  <text start="259.93" dur="6.76">they will not let go of the illusion of</text>
  <text start="263.03" dur="7.02">a recovery no matter what data comes in</text>
  <text start="266.69" dur="6.36">it doesn&amp;#39;t matter at at this point we</text>
  <text start="270.05" dur="7.38">see the you Mitch consumer hope has</text>
  <text start="273.05" dur="7.65">tumbled consumer sentiment final print</text>
  <text start="277.43" dur="6.84">for July dropped even further to 93.1</text>
  <text start="280.7" dur="7.32">heading back towards the low of the year</text>
  <text start="284.27" dur="7.95">as hope lunch from 87.8 to 84.1 the</text>
  <text start="288.02" dur="6.959">lowest since november of 2014 now of</text>
  <text start="292.22" dur="5.1">course the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="294.979" dur="4.891">are telling us that no will recover</text>
  <text start="297.32" dur="6.36">ring unemployment at five point three</text>
  <text start="299.87" dur="7.5">percent you can tell everyone has a job</text>
  <text start="303.68" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re doing well right retail is</text>
  <text start="307.37" dur="3.99">fantastic I don&amp;#39;t know what everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="309.05" dur="4.98">talking about don&amp;#39;t mind these stories</text>
  <text start="311.36" dur="4.38">that are closing what the prices came</text>
  <text start="314.03" dur="4.47">down and real estate a little bit don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="315.74" dur="6.3">worry about that that&amp;#39;s not a big</text>
  <text start="318.5" dur="6.15">concern because as ben bernanke told us</text>
  <text start="322.04" dur="5.7">back in 2008 real estate real estate</text>
  <text start="324.65" dur="5.57">really doesn&amp;#39;t decline so don&amp;#39;t wear all</text>
  <text start="327.74" dur="6.96">this is contained and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="330.22" dur="7.81">similarities that brings us back to two</text>
  <text start="334.7" dur="6.99">thousand eight even the wage growth here</text>
  <text start="338.03" dur="5.7">in the United States is the weakest</text>
  <text start="341.69" dur="10.11">since records began in nineteen</text>
  <text start="343.73" dur="11.97">eighty-two so what is going on here why</text>
  <text start="351.8" dur="7.74">are wages so low why aren&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="355.7" dur="6.36">increasing I mean we see inflation in</text>
  <text start="359.54" dur="4.89">certain areas I know they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="362.06" dur="6.87">there&amp;#39;s no inflation but it&amp;#39;s very easy</text>
  <text start="364.43" dur="7.08">to hide especially in food I mean you go</text>
  <text start="368.93" dur="5.52">to the supermarket you go to the big</text>
  <text start="371.51" dur="5.4">warehouse places I see increases in</text>
  <text start="374.45" dur="5.61">prices all the time or what do you see</text>
  <text start="376.91" dur="5.94">you see product shrinking you see them</text>
  <text start="380.06" dur="4.62">substituting different ingredients to</text>
  <text start="382.85" dur="4.83">make the product cheaper this is what</text>
  <text start="384.68" dur="5.52">they do to hide what is really going on</text>
  <text start="387.68" dur="5.79">and we have spotted this time and time</text>
  <text start="390.2" dur="5.4">again in ice cream and the amount of</text>
  <text start="393.47" dur="5.91">crackers in a package an amount of</text>
  <text start="395.6" dur="6.54">tissues in a tissue box they make</text>
  <text start="399.38" dur="5.97">products a little bit smaller but they</text>
  <text start="402.14" dur="5.82">charge the same and when that can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="405.35" dur="5.58">continue they raised the price a little</text>
  <text start="407.96" dur="5.88">bit and say say look the ice cream only</text>
  <text start="410.93" dur="5.52">went up you know twenty cents yeah but</text>
  <text start="413.84" dur="5.37">it&amp;#39;s no longer half gallon it&amp;#39;s less</text>
  <text start="416.45" dur="5.88">than a half gallon so really the</text>
  <text start="419.21" dur="4.23">increase in price is a dollar but they</text>
  <text start="422.33" dur="5.85">don&amp;#39;t like to tell you that but why</text>
  <text start="423.44" dur="7.56">having wages gone up well when we look</text>
  <text start="428.18" dur="5.34">back we see what&amp;#39;s been happening</text>
  <text start="431" dur="8.04">we have lost 1.4 million manufacturing</text>
  <text start="433.52" dur="8.04">jobs since 2007 and we have gained 1.4</text>
  <text start="439.04" dur="7.65">million waiters and bartenders since</text>
  <text start="441.56" dur="9.02">2007 the great rotation high-paying</text>
  <text start="446.69" dur="5.94">better jobs for low paying service jobs</text>
  <text start="450.58" dur="4.78">now of course those people who are</text>
  <text start="452.63" dur="7.08">waiters and bartenders nothing against</text>
  <text start="455.36" dur="7.8">anybody who does any type of work but</text>
  <text start="459.71" dur="8.58">what we&amp;#39;re seeing here right now is that</text>
  <text start="463.16" dur="8.16">we are giving up those jobs that produce</text>
  <text start="468.29" dur="6.6">something those jobs that have a future</text>
  <text start="471.32" dur="7.95">those jobs that support the economy of</text>
  <text start="474.89" dur="6.51">the United States they&amp;#39;re gone and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="479.27" dur="4.14">replacing them with lower paying jobs</text>
  <text start="481.4" dur="5.43">this is why wages are continually</text>
  <text start="483.41" dur="6.99">declining think about why they want</text>
  <text start="486.83" dur="6.36">wages to go up in retail why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="490.4" dur="4.59">calling for a new minimum wage I mean is</text>
  <text start="493.19" dur="5.64">this really going to solve the problem</text>
  <text start="494.99" dur="7.77">do you really think raising someone from</text>
  <text start="498.83" dur="7.71">twelve dollars to $15 solves the problem</text>
  <text start="502.76" dur="5.49">in the short run yes it will at that</text>
  <text start="506.54" dur="3.6">point in time people will say okay I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="508.25" dur="5.55">making a little bit more money I can</text>
  <text start="510.14" dur="6.899">breathe a little bit easier but what</text>
  <text start="513.8" dur="9.109">happens a year from now two years from</text>
  <text start="517.039" dur="9.781">now all those people who got an increase</text>
  <text start="522.909" dur="6.911">from minimum wage is there back in the</text>
  <text start="526.82" dur="7.29">same position why because the value of</text>
  <text start="529.82" dur="8.01">the dollar is decreasing rapidly which</text>
  <text start="534.11" dur="6.81">means products are continually going up</text>
  <text start="537.83" dur="6.96">and once these corporations can no</text>
  <text start="540.92" dur="7.14">longer substitute ingredients shrink the</text>
  <text start="544.79" dur="4.65">packages and this usually ends when</text>
  <text start="548.06" dur="4.29">people start saying hey wait a minute</text>
  <text start="549.44" dur="5.67">what is going on here I used to have</text>
  <text start="552.35" dur="5.19">this many tissues in a package and now</text>
  <text start="555.11" dur="6.11">it&amp;#39;s half of that so there&amp;#39;s a certain</text>
  <text start="557.54" dur="7.07">point where they&amp;#39;ll stop doing it and</text>
  <text start="561.22" dur="6">when that time comes</text>
  <text start="564.61" dur="6.49">this is going to be a problem because</text>
  <text start="567.22" dur="5.68">prices will never stop going up the</text>
  <text start="571.1" dur="3.92">value of the dollar is continually</text>
  <text start="572.9" dur="6.09">decreasing here in the United States I</text>
  <text start="575.02" dur="6.43">mean we heard from walmart they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="578.99" dur="3.87">to be raising minimum wage and then all</text>
  <text start="581.45" dur="6.81">of a sudden they&amp;#39;re preparing to fire a</text>
  <text start="582.86" dur="9.33">thousand people so did this help out the</text>
  <text start="588.26" dur="6.99">main problem is the central banking</text>
  <text start="592.19" dur="8.12">system where they loan the money out</text>
  <text start="595.25" dur="10.17">with interest attached if the government</text>
  <text start="600.31" dur="10.42">created this money there would be no</text>
  <text start="605.42" dur="9.39">interest attached but why do we have the</text>
  <text start="610.73" dur="7.77">Federal Reserve what benefit is it to</text>
  <text start="614.81" dur="7.32">the American people what benefit is it</text>
  <text start="618.5" dur="6.3">to the government employees well why</text>
  <text start="622.13" dur="4.95">would they accept this what would be the</text>
  <text start="624.8" dur="5.16">reason they would want something like</text>
  <text start="627.08" dur="4.74">this because the government can easily</text>
  <text start="629.96" dur="4.08">create the money just like they create</text>
  <text start="631.82" dur="6.09">Treasury bonds it&amp;#39;s not that big of a</text>
  <text start="634.04" dur="6.18">deal they create the coins the only</text>
  <text start="637.91" dur="6.24">reason is because they&amp;#39;re getting a</text>
  <text start="640.22" dur="6.42">kickback what other reason could there</text>
  <text start="644.15" dur="6.42">be why cuz the Federal Reserve does such</text>
  <text start="646.64" dur="5.97">a great job balancing the economy no</text>
  <text start="650.57" dur="4.35">they don&amp;#39;t they manipulate the economy</text>
  <text start="652.61" dur="5.85">to their benefit it is a private</text>
  <text start="654.92" dur="5.91">corporation their product is debt and</text>
  <text start="658.46" dur="6.69">when they loan out one dollar they</text>
  <text start="660.83" dur="7.05">expect to back it&amp;#39;s impossible because</text>
  <text start="665.15" dur="4.65">only one dollar was loaned out if that</text>
  <text start="667.88" dur="4.11">was the first dollar where do you get</text>
  <text start="669.8" dur="5.67">the other one oh that&amp;#39;s right you have</text>
  <text start="671.99" dur="6.12">to borrow some more and this is why here</text>
  <text start="675.47" dur="4.95">in this country seven out of 10</text>
  <text start="678.11" dur="7.23">Americans believe that debt is a</text>
  <text start="680.42" dur="8.19">necessity in their lives most Americans</text>
  <text start="685.34" dur="5.94">right now say they cannot live without</text>
  <text start="688.61" dur="4.95">having some type of credit card or some</text>
  <text start="691.28" dur="5.1">type of debt and this is coming from a</text>
  <text start="693.56" dur="4.47">Pew survey saying that 7 out of 10</text>
  <text start="696.38" dur="3.15">Americans believe that debt</text>
  <text start="698.03" dur="3.27">a necessity in their lives and</text>
  <text start="699.53" dur="5.25">approximately eight out of ten Americans</text>
  <text start="701.3" dur="5.67">actually have debt right now most of us</text>
  <text start="704.78" dur="6.9">like to think that yeah someday I&amp;#39;ll pay</text>
  <text start="706.97" dur="7.65">off this debt but very few people</text>
  <text start="711.68" dur="5.82">actually pay it off and if they do they</text>
  <text start="714.62" dur="6.36">run the debt up once again this is</text>
  <text start="717.5" dur="8.73">because the entire system is designed to</text>
  <text start="720.98" dur="7.26">trap us and it starts at an early age</text>
  <text start="726.23" dur="4.26">like in college when they start giving</text>
  <text start="728.24" dur="4.83">you credit cards or when you&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="730.49" dur="6.96">out of high school when you have student</text>
  <text start="733.07" dur="8.93">loans the system has been designed to</text>
  <text start="737.45" dur="7.89">keep you in debt and as your salary</text>
  <text start="742" dur="6.91">continually declines it doesn&amp;#39;t go up to</text>
  <text start="745.34" dur="5.1">keep up with inflation you can&amp;#39;t survive</text>
  <text start="748.91" dur="6.08">on it so what do you need to survive on</text>
  <text start="750.44" dur="6.63">it you need to borrow which creates debt</text>
  <text start="754.99" dur="3.97">forty-three percent of all american</text>
  <text start="757.07" dur="4.65">households spend more money than they</text>
  <text start="758.96" dur="5.82">make each month and US households are</text>
  <text start="761.72" dur="6.93">more than 11 trillion dollars in debt at</text>
  <text start="764.78" dur="6.21">this point according to new data that</text>
  <text start="768.65" dur="6.41">was released the total amount of student</text>
  <text start="770.99" dur="6.98">loan debt is now 1.2 trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="775.06" dur="7.6">this total has doubled over the last</text>
  <text start="777.97" dur="6.13">decade right now there are 40 million</text>
  <text start="782.66" dur="5.96">Americans that are paying off their</text>
  <text start="784.1" dur="8.25">student loan debt and many of them many</text>
  <text start="788.62" dur="6.19">cannot find the job they went to school</text>
  <text start="792.35" dur="4.68">for they&amp;#39;re working part-time living</text>
  <text start="794.81" dur="4.35">with their parents trying to pay this</text>
  <text start="797.03" dur="5.7">debt off a lot of them have modified</text>
  <text start="799.16" dur="6.48">loans at this point but when we look at</text>
  <text start="802.73" dur="8.12">the situation we see there are signs</text>
  <text start="805.64" dur="9.03">everywhere that this government is going</text>
  <text start="810.85" dur="5.86">broke I mean look at this they came out</text>
  <text start="814.67" dur="3.51">with the Social Security disability</text>
  <text start="816.71" dur="4.59">insurance saying it is going to be</text>
  <text start="818.18" dur="4.95">insolvent by 2016 so what does the</text>

  <text start="1276.35" dur="4.89">right now is they&amp;#39;re using a lot of fear</text>
  <text start="1278.87" dur="4.13">scare tactics to push their agenda</text>
  <text start="1281.24" dur="3.96">through and like I said in the past</text>
  <text start="1283" dur="3.58">everyone needs to take their own</text>
  <text start="1285.2" dur="3.87">response everyone needs to take</text>

  <text start="1354.11" dur="5.46">are many many different ways that you</text>
  <text start="1356.12" dur="8.5">can protect yourself at this point now</text>
  <text start="1359.57" dur="8.98">it just so happens that the NSA</text>
  <text start="1364.62" dur="6.72">came out with their secret NSA map the</text>
  <text start="1368.55" dur="7.89">last five years showing the Chinese</text>
  <text start="1371.34" dur="8.7">cyber attacks so what are we seeing</text>
  <text start="1376.44" dur="5.97">right now we&amp;#39;re seeing that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1380.04" dur="4.62">building this up now of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1382.41" dur="3.21">saying yes we are being attacked and</text>
  <text start="1384.66" dur="2.22">these are the countries that are</text>
  <text start="1385.62" dur="5.31">attacking us and it&amp;#39;s always the same</text>
  <text start="1386.88" dur="8.52">players it&amp;#39;s China Russia Iran North</text>

  <text start="1399.15" dur="5.779">are the countries that are hitting the</text>
  <text start="1400.77" dur="7.59">United States and we need to be prepared</text>
  <text start="1404.929" dur="6.671">so basically what is happening here is</text>
  <text start="1408.36" dur="7.02">they&amp;#39;re using fear they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1411.6" dur="11.01">push legislation through and eventually</text>
  <text start="1415.38" dur="8.97">this will be used as the catalyst to</text>
  <text start="1422.61" dur="4.5">blame it on another country because they</text>
  <text start="1424.35" dur="4.92">can say we warned you about this we told</text>
  <text start="1427.11" dur="5.76">you it was China it was North Korea was</text>
  <text start="1429.27" dur="6.03">Iran it was Russia and now look what</text>
  <text start="1432.87" dur="5.58">happened half the country quarter of the</text>

  <text start="1438.45" dur="4.35">destroyed the financial institutions but</text>
  <text start="1441.75" dur="3.51">then you have to think you&amp;#39;re to</text>
  <text start="1442.8" dur="7.71">yourself what is the motivation for</text>
  <text start="1445.26" dur="8.94">Russia China Iran North Korea to do any</text>
  <text start="1450.51" dur="7.26">of this I mean Russia right now Putin is</text>
  <text start="1454.2" dur="5.37">trying to basically stop what the US is</text>
  <text start="1457.77" dur="5.85">trying to do and that&amp;#39;s trying to push</text>

  <text start="1794.159" dur="8.22">surprised if this whole thing is pushed</text>
  <text start="1796.95" dur="7.589">to the next level now out in Ukraine we</text>
  <text start="1802.379" dur="5.25">see that there was a poll taken in</text>
  <text start="1804.539" dur="5.551">Ukraine and eighty-four percent of</text>
  <text start="1807.629" dur="6.601">Ukrainians believe Putin is the best</text>
  <text start="1810.09" dur="6.36">leader for that country now this might</text>
  <text start="1814.23" dur="5.129">have been manipulated but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1816.45" dur="4.469">interesting about this is that the</text>
  <text start="1819.359" dur="3.991">numbers show that Putin has eighty four</text>
  <text start="1820.919" dur="7.1">percent poroshenko has one percent</text>
  <text start="1823.35" dur="8.429">Merkel one percent Obama one percent and</text>
  <text start="1828.019" dur="7.72">if you go back to 2012 they have</text>
  <text start="1831.779" dur="10.051">Yatsenyuk on video praising Putin and</text>
  <text start="1835.739" dur="8.581">his leadership and he even said that</text>
  <text start="1841.83" dur="10.589">Putin is a great example for Ukraine to</text>
  <text start="1844.32" dur="9.569">follow and now he&amp;#39;s working and pushing</text>
  <text start="1852.419" dur="5.88">the agenda for the central bankers</text>
  <text start="1853.889" dur="7.35">because he is a central banker how times</text>
  <text start="1858.299" dur="8.181">have changed especially when you get</text>
  <text start="1861.239" dur="9.53">paid off and your promise certain things</text>
  <text start="1866.48" dur="6.789">now we understand the Kiev is trying to</text>
  <text start="1870.769" dur="5.62">remove itself from getting the supplies</text>
  <text start="1873.269" dur="4.801">of gas from Russia and they&amp;#39;re turning</text>
  <text start="1876.389" dur="3.39">towards other countries to get this gas</text>
  <text start="1878.07" dur="3.66">but what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this</text>
  <text start="1879.779" dur="6.33">whole thing is they&amp;#39;re actually getting</text>
  <text start="1881.73" dur="6.149">Russian gas because Russia pumps the gas</text>
  <text start="1886.109" dur="6.841">to those countries and then those</text>
  <text start="1887.879" dur="7.351">countries supply it to Kiev so basically</text>
  <text start="1892.95" dur="5.729">Ukraine is replacing Russian gas with</text>
  <text start="1895.23" dur="3.9">Russian gas they&amp;#39;re just not getting it</text>
  <text start="1898.679" dur="5.041">to wreck</text>
  <text start="1899.13" dur="6.93">from the source so if something does</text>
  <text start="1903.72" dur="5.22">occur this is how they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1906.06" dur="5.37">protect themselves because Russia most</text>
  <text start="1908.94" dur="3.6">likely will not shut off the gas from</text>
  <text start="1911.43" dur="4.53">those countries because they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1912.54" dur="5.84">continually pay and Ukraine can get the</text>
  <text start="1915.96" dur="6.48">gas siphoned off from those countries</text>
  <text start="1918.38" dur="6.25">now Ukraine&amp;#39;s Constitutional Court they</text>
  <text start="1922.44" dur="4.58">have ruled that the draft</text>
  <text start="1924.63" dur="5.46">decentralization amendments they are</text>
  <text start="1927.02" dur="5.47">constitutional the south eastern areas</text>
  <text start="1930.09" dur="5.16">can have their independence they do not</text>
  <text start="1932.49" dur="6.27">run counter to articles 157 and 158 of</text>
  <text start="1935.25" dur="7.97">the country&amp;#39;s constitution now what has</text>
  <text start="1938.76" dur="7.26">to happen well it goes to poroshenko and</text>
  <text start="1943.22" dur="6.01">Ukraine then would need to adopt the new</text>
  <text start="1946.02" dur="6.15">constitution and give the Donetsk</text>
  <text start="1949.23" dur="4.86">Lugansk people there is regions their</text>

  <text start="1954.09" dur="5.61">agreement and of course poroshenko</text>
  <text start="1958.02" dur="4.35">saying no we&amp;#39;re not going to be doing</text>
  <text start="1959.7" dur="4.65">this the Donetsk and Lugansk Republic&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1962.37" dur="3.72">have said that the draft constitutional</text>
  <text start="1964.35" dur="3.48">amendments prepared by Kiev did not</text>
  <text start="1966.09" dur="3.93">correspond to the Minsk agreements</text>
  <text start="1967.83" dur="5.52">whatsoever so we&amp;#39;re going to have to see</text>
  <text start="1970.02" dur="7.14">what happens to see how poroshenko</text>
  <text start="1973.35" dur="8.34">handles the next step now we are getting</text>

  <text start="2135.77" dur="8.45">for Greece and other countries and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2139.609" dur="7.411">wondering is this dragging on right now</text>
  <text start="2144.22" dur="7">because of the meeting between Erdogan</text>

  <text start="2168.92" dur="3.96">form a coalition yield no results after</text>
  <text start="2170.96" dur="4.47">after the ruling party lost its overall</text>
  <text start="2172.88" dur="5.61">majority and a lot of people are saying</text>
  <text start="2175.43" dur="5.52">well turkey went in to Syria and</text>
  <text start="2178.49" dur="5.55">creating the safe zone this was also</text>
  <text start="2180.95" dur="6.26">hurricane can get an early election to</text>
  <text start="2184.04" dur="5.97">destroy the opposition party well when</text>
  <text start="2187.21" dur="4.75">governments do this it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="2190.01" dur="4.86">because of one agenda it&amp;#39;s because of</text>
  <text start="2191.96" dur="5.85">many different agendas and this might be</text>
  <text start="2194.87" dur="5.25">part of it to stay in power right now</text>
  <text start="2197.81" dur="5.28">turkey is without a full-time government</text>
  <text start="2200.12" dur="5.43">even as it presses cross-border military</text>
  <text start="2203.09" dur="9">operations against militants in Syria</text>
  <text start="2205.55" dur="14.69">and in Iraq so what are we seeing right</text>
  <text start="2212.09" dur="14.27">now well we are seeing turkey using this</text>
  <text start="2220.24" dur="9.76">to get a safe zone to go into Syria</text>
  <text start="2226.36" dur="7.09">they&amp;#39;re trying to create a reason why</text>
  <text start="2230" dur="7.17">they needed to do this and it serves</text>
  <text start="2233.45" dur="6.99">many different purposes and at this</text>
  <text start="2237.17" dur="7.5">point in time we see this was a plan all</text>
  <text start="2240.44" dur="6.9">along it was to create these safe zones</text>
  <text start="2244.67" dur="6.72">to bring troops in because their goal is</text>
  <text start="2247.34" dur="6.6">the same it&amp;#39;s never changed its to get</text>
  <text start="2251.39" dur="5.19">so they could tell you over and over</text>
  <text start="2253.94" dur="6.33">this is not what it&amp;#39;s about but we know</text>
  <text start="2256.58" dur="5.79">turkey is behind the Islamic state they</text>
  <text start="2260.27" dur="4.05">support them they let them go back and</text>
  <text start="2262.37" dur="6.18">forth between the borders of Syria and</text>
  <text start="2264.32" dur="5.58">Turkey we know the u.s. uses the Islamic</text>
  <text start="2268.55" dur="6.15">state as their proxy army they were</text>
  <text start="2269.9" dur="7.47">trained ready to go and we can see at</text>
  <text start="2274.7" dur="10.77">this point in time that all of this is</text>
  <text start="2277.37" dur="12.63">being done for one reason so let&amp;#39;s take</text>
  <text start="2285.47" dur="7.98">a look at this for a second the US and</text>
  <text start="2290" dur="7.44">the coalition forces with millions and</text>

  <text start="2308.059" dur="9.861">started to bomb in a sovereign country</text>
  <text start="2311.71" dur="10.51">and right now after all this bombing</text>
  <text start="2317.92" dur="9.399">billions of dollars spent over a year</text>
  <text start="2322.22" dur="9.66">later what are we seeing we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="2327.319" dur="7.5">the Islamic state is fundamentally no</text>
  <text start="2331.88" dur="5.61">weaker than it then when it was when the</text>
  <text start="2334.819" dur="4.8">us-led bombing campaign began a year ago</text>
  <text start="2337.49" dur="5.97">and this is coming from mounam an</text>

  <text start="2352.28" dur="7.769">the group total strength at 20 to 30,000</text>
  <text start="2356.68" dur="6.57">there at the same exact level and guess</text>
  <text start="2360.049" dur="7.621">what the territory they&amp;#39;ve captured is</text>
  <text start="2363.25" dur="7.65">three times bigger so they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="2367.67" dur="6.629">convince us this is why they&amp;#39;re doing it</text>
  <text start="2370.9" dur="6.28">but all the evidence points to the</text>
  <text start="2374.299" dur="5.931">opposite of what is really happening and</text>
  <text start="2377.18" dur="5.7">like I always said whenever government</text>
  <text start="2380.23" dur="5.17">employees tell you something or central</text>
  <text start="2382.88" dur="4.5">bankers it is always the opposite of</text>
  <text start="2385.4" dur="4.89">what&amp;#39;s really going on even with</text>
  <text start="2387.38" dur="6.3">legislation the Affordable Care Act not</text>

  <text start="2393.68" dur="5.61">patriotic at all the US Freedom Act no</text>
  <text start="2397.79" dur="4.529">it doesn&amp;#39;t give anyone freedom</text>
  <text start="2399.29" dur="6.66">whatsoever if you look at all of this it</text>
  <text start="2402.319" dur="5.911">does not do what it says it&amp;#39;s always the</text>
  <text start="2405.95" dur="6.139">opposite they just put those fancy</text>
  <text start="2408.23" dur="7.29">titles on it to confuse everyone and</text>
  <text start="2412.089" dur="7.951">what we are seeing right now is they are</text>
  <text start="2415.52" dur="8.13">continually making their move into Syria</text>
  <text start="2420.04" dur="8.22">trying to confuse everyone of what is</text>
  <text start="2423.65" dur="10.62">really going on here and we know that</text>
  <text start="2428.26" dur="7.99">the US UK they&amp;#39;re covertly financing the</text>
  <text start="2434.27" dur="3.87">terrorist movement and this is coming</text>
  <text start="2436.25" dur="5.069">from a senior political source in the</text>
  <text start="2438.14" dur="6.57">region US and British oil companies are</text>
  <text start="2441.319" dur="5.461">heavily invested in the murky</text>
  <text start="2444.71" dur="4.29">geopolitical triangle sustaining the</text>
  <text start="2446.78" dur="4.74">Islamic state black market oil sales</text>
  <text start="2449" dur="4.47">because what they&amp;#39;ve done is they bombed</text>
  <text start="2451.52" dur="4.309">the area in Syria destroyed the</text>
  <text start="2453.47" dur="5.99">infrastructure and taking control of</text>
  <text start="2455.829" dur="7.78">their oil and they put it for sale on</text>
  <text start="2459.46" dur="6.82">the black market they have control a</text>
  <text start="2463.609" dur="7.26">have control of sixty percent of Syria&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2466.28" dur="8.76">oil right now and turkey is playing a</text>
  <text start="2470.869" dur="6.031">double game with with Syria strategy the</text>
  <text start="2475.04" dur="3.42">scale of the Islamic state smuggling</text>
  <text start="2476.9" dur="6.53">operation across the turkish-syrian</text>

  <text start="2483.43" dur="8.32">facilitated with the blessing from her</text>
  <text start="2487.369" dur="8.551">digan so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="2491.75" dur="7.2">that this is being done for one reason</text>
  <text start="2495.92" dur="6.87">and that&amp;#39;s to go after Assad all this</text>
  <text start="2498.95" dur="5.849">other stuff is a smokescreen to confuse</text>
  <text start="2502.79" dur="5.819">everyone of what&amp;#39;s really going on this</text>
  <text start="2504.799" dur="5.161">is why they went into Syria and they</text>
  <text start="2508.609" dur="3.21">started the bombing runs because they</text>
  <text start="2509.96" dur="5.389">really wanted to do this back in 2013</text>
  <text start="2511.819" dur="9.691">but it was called off because of Putin</text>
  <text start="2515.349" dur="7.781">he basically put forth a peace plan to</text>
  <text start="2521.51" dur="3.99">destroy the chemical weapons and now of</text>
  <text start="2523.13" dur="3.979">course they&amp;#39;re trying to say that Assad</text>

  <text start="2529.88" dur="7.469">creating them he&amp;#39;s still using them</text>
  <text start="2533.559" dur="6.401">because he had these mobile facilities</text>
  <text start="2537.349" dur="5.611">and they can&amp;#39;t find all of them because</text>
  <text start="2539.96" dur="5.67">he was hiding them so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2542.96" dur="6.869">continually using this excuse they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2545.63" dur="8.939">still using this propaganda because</text>
  <text start="2549.829" dur="9.151">their main mission is to go in to</text>
