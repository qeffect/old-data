  <text start="123.209" dur="3.841">they&amp;#39;re going to be using crypto</text>
  <text start="124.47" dur="4.53">currencies to do this and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="127.05" dur="4.56">see a lot more countries start to do</text>
  <text start="129" dur="4.05">this we know that Russia is looking at</text>
  <text start="131.61" dur="4.05">the blockchain China&amp;#39;s looking at the</text>
  <text start="133.05" dur="3.84">blockchain and basically the central</text>
  <text start="135.66" dur="3.99">bankers are sitting there scratching</text>
  <text start="136.89" dur="6.209">their head saying we cannot let this</text>
  <text start="139.65" dur="5.1">happen we need to stop this this is why</text>
  <text start="143.099" dur="4.5">they created the futures market in</text>
  <text start="144.75" dur="4.56">Bitcoin the same thing that they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="147.599" dur="3.931">with the precious metals market they</text>
  <text start="149.31" dur="4.95">created the futures market it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="151.53" dur="5.819">paper and they&amp;#39;re able to basically</text>
  <text start="154.26" dur="4.89">control the price by selling a lot of</text>
  <text start="157.349" dur="3.991">this paper and they&amp;#39;re able to bring</text>
  <text start="159.15" dur="2.669">this price down they&amp;#39;re also using the</text>
  <text start="161.34" dur="2.759">amount</text>
  <text start="161.819" dur="4.621">GOx proceeds and they&amp;#39;re using those</text>
  <text start="164.099" dur="4.5">funds to bring down Bitcoin when they</text>
  <text start="166.44" dur="4.439">sell a lot of them and they&amp;#39;re using all</text>
  <text start="168.599" dur="3.571">of this to try to control Bitcoin and</text>
  <text start="170.879" dur="3.271">make it look like it&amp;#39;s very volatile</text>
  <text start="172.17" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s not safe you shouldn&amp;#39;t be in it</text>
  <text start="174.15" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s like gambling and the central</text>
  <text start="176.31" dur="3.03">bankers are trying to protect you we</text>
  <text start="178.23" dur="3.48">already see that the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="179.34" dur="4.59">Bank of San Francisco they release an</text>
  <text start="181.71" dur="5.24">economic letter on May 7th suggesting</text>
  <text start="183.93" dur="5.449">that bitcoins decline follow</text>
  <text start="186.95" dur="5.21">it&amp;#39;s $20,000 peak was a result of the</text>
  <text start="189.379" dur="5.371">launch of Bitcoin futures trading not</text>
  <text start="192.16" dur="5.799">necessarily because as we can see on the</text>
  <text start="194.75" dur="5.879">graph it was really brought down by</text>
  <text start="197.959" dur="5.341">those individuals selling all of those</text>
  <text start="200.629" dur="4.501">bitcoins from Mount Cox and each time</text>
  <text start="203.3" dur="3.48">they sold it the price came down and</text>
  <text start="205.13" dur="3.96">this is basically what they&amp;#39;ve done now</text>
  <text start="206.78" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re going to try to control the</text>
  <text start="209.09" dur="5.429">cryptocurrency market with the Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="211.91" dur="5.01">futures and this is why they created it</text>
  <text start="214.519" dur="5.101">and this is what they do all the time</text>
  <text start="216.92" dur="4.62">they use paper to control precious</text>
  <text start="219.62" dur="4.589">metals paper to control the</text>
  <text start="221.54" dur="4.259">cryptocurrency but when all said and</text>
  <text start="224.209" dur="3.271">done it doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="225.799" dur="3.601">able to control it because again this is</text>
  <text start="227.48" dur="5.46">decentralized it&amp;#39;s out of their reach</text>
  <text start="229.4" dur="5.55">and they&amp;#39;re only using it with Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="232.94" dur="4.65">there&amp;#39;s many other crypto currencies out</text>
  <text start="234.95" dur="4.53">there and if people decide not to go at</text>
  <text start="237.59" dur="4.17">Bitcoin and dump it and go with</text>
  <text start="239.48" dur="4.89">something else guess what they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="241.76" dur="5.52">trouble especially with the atomic swaps</text>
  <text start="244.37" dur="6.69">where their people are able to swap</text>
  <text start="247.28" dur="6.12">different crypto coins with each other</text>
  <text start="251.06" dur="5.94">and they don&amp;#39;t have to worry about it it</text>
  <text start="253.4" dur="5.76">might not be that big of a deal but we</text>
  <text start="257" dur="4.169">can see right now that they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="259.16" dur="4.92">their agenda because they want to</text>
  <text start="261.169" dur="5.931">control this area they want to make sure</text>
  <text start="264.08" dur="5.79">that they force people away from it and</text>
  <text start="267.1" dur="5.68">they are trying to figure out a way to</text>
  <text start="269.87" dur="5.28">stop what is happening and more and more</text>
  <text start="272.78" dur="4.62">countries are looking at this more and</text>
  <text start="275.15" dur="5.519">more investors are looking at this and</text>
  <text start="277.4" dur="5.54">their biggest fear right now is the</text>
  <text start="280.669" dur="5.191">exchanges now right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="282.94" dur="5.11">centralized they can control them just</text>
  <text start="285.86" dur="3.63">like they had coin base where they said</text>
  <text start="288.05" dur="4.38">listen you need you need to hand over</text>
  <text start="289.49" dur="5.52">all those individuals that receive funds</text>
  <text start="292.43" dur="4.95">of 20,000 or above we need to tax these</text>
  <text start="295.01" dur="6.42">individuals what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="297.38" dur="7.02">counter is the decentralization of the</text>
  <text start="301.43" dur="5.88">exchanges where they will not have any</text>
  <text start="304.4" dur="6.54">control whatsoever remember the central</text>
  <text start="307.31" dur="5.31">bank system since they create this</text>
  <text start="310.94" dur="3.87">currency with a push of a button it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="312.62" dur="5.07">not like Bitcoin it takes a lot of</text>
  <text start="314.81" dur="5.19">processing power a lot of time to create</text>
  <text start="317.69" dur="2.94">the cryptocurrency the central bankers</text>
  <text start="320" dur="2.01">they</text>
  <text start="320.63" dur="2.73">have the ability just to push the button</text>
  <text start="322.01" dur="5.7">it just created there&amp;#39;s no hard work</text>
  <text start="323.36" dur="7.77">involved whatsoever and what we know is</text>
  <text start="327.71" dur="6.09">that they lend this this currency they</text>
  <text start="331.13" dur="5.07">create out of thin air to governments</text>
  <text start="333.8" dur="4.5">and the government&amp;#39;s have to pay it back</text>
  <text start="336.2" dur="4.02">actually the people have to pay it back</text>
  <text start="338.3" dur="4.14">so there&amp;#39;s interest attached with this</text>
  <text start="340.22" dur="4.41">and the only way to pay this back is</text>
  <text start="342.44" dur="3.75">with taxes because they need to collect</text>
  <text start="344.63" dur="4.14">the money from the people of every</text>
  <text start="346.19" dur="4.47">single country to pay back the Federal</text>
  <text start="348.77" dur="3.32">Reserve Note and this is how they</text>
  <text start="350.66" dur="5.79">enslave the people</text>
  <text start="352.09" dur="8.16">if the cryptocurrency system moves</text>
  <text start="356.45" dur="5.01">forward and there&amp;#39;s these centralized</text>
  <text start="360.25" dur="4.24">exchanges</text>
  <text start="361.46" dur="4.56">there&amp;#39;s no taxes how do they tax</text>
  <text start="364.49" dur="4.05">something like this yes they could</text>
  <text start="366.02" dur="3.57">create a worldwide tax but again they</text>
  <text start="368.54" dur="2.88">would have to get a lot of countries</text>
  <text start="369.59" dur="3.42">involved in this and there are many</text>
  <text start="371.42" dur="3.66">countries saying that we don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="373.01" dur="5.07">be involved in this and this is a lot</text>
  <text start="375.08" dur="4.71">harder to do then having each country</text>
  <text start="378.08" dur="5.13">tax their own people instead of having a</text>
  <text start="379.79" dur="5.58">worldwide tax so they&amp;#39;re afraid of this</text>
  <text start="383.21" dur="5.58">and they&amp;#39;re trying to stop this before</text>
  <text start="385.37" dur="4.95">this becomes a reality and if you want</text>
  <text start="388.79" dur="5.28">to know more about cryptocurrency I do</text>

  <text start="400.28" dur="4.71">starting to catch on now starting to</text>

  <text start="404.99" dur="5.43">see that there is a company that is</text>

  <text start="476.419" dur="5.911">openings so what this report is trying</text>
  <text start="479.12" dur="5.49">to tell us is that we have so many job</text>

  <text start="496.37" dur="4.799">over the place and we just don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="499.189" dur="4.26">enough people to fill these positions</text>
  <text start="501.169" dur="5.071">actually the opposite is happening right</text>
  <text start="503.449" dur="4.44">now corporations they&amp;#39;re really not</text>
  <text start="506.24" dur="4.049">hiring right now they&amp;#39;re buying back</text>
  <text start="507.889" dur="6.84">their stocks profits aren&amp;#39;t coming in</text>
  <text start="510.289" dur="6.63">and they&amp;#39;re laying off retail the</text>
  <text start="514.729" dur="4.62">corporate offices are closing people are</text>
  <text start="516.919" dur="4.23">getting laid off left and right stores</text>
  <text start="519.349" dur="4.711">are closing which means more and more</text>
  <text start="521.149" dur="6.331">people are being laid off so where all</text>
  <text start="524.06" dur="5.49">these jobs coming from again a lot of</text>
  <text start="527.48" dur="4.919">corporations what they do is they keep</text>
  <text start="529.55" dur="5.18">their open wrecks and from the top</text>
  <text start="532.399" dur="5.491">corporate offices they tell them listen</text>
  <text start="534.73" dur="6.4">do not fill these positions but we will</text>
  <text start="537.89" dur="5.43">leave the open wrecks and we could see</text>
  <text start="541.13" dur="5.13">this is what is happening right now now</text>
  <text start="543.32" dur="6.84">if we look at what happened prior to</text>
  <text start="546.26" dur="8.46">2008 we saw we hit a plateau with job</text>
  <text start="550.16" dur="7.44">hires and all of a sudden in 2007 we</text>
  <text start="554.72" dur="7.609">started a decline the same thing is</text>
  <text start="557.6" dur="9.33">happening here in 2018 we are now</text>
  <text start="562.329" dur="7.271">declining in job hires and job openings</text>
  <text start="566.93" dur="6.18">job hires they&amp;#39;re going to start to</text>
  <text start="569.6" dur="4.89">decline rapidly and basically once we</text>
  <text start="573.11" dur="5.4">started this little bit of a decline in</text>
  <text start="574.49" dur="6.539">2007 and we moved into 2008 boy did</text>
  <text start="578.51" dur="4.319">things ramp up and we accelerated to the</text>
  <text start="581.029" dur="5.25">downside and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="582.829" dur="4.811">right now we&amp;#39;re at the plateau and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="586.279" dur="3.911">gonna see this whole thing come</text>
  <text start="587.64" dur="4.68">we fall apart we also see that TVs</text>
  <text start="590.19" dur="5.28">Ameritrade investor movement index</text>
  <text start="592.32" dur="5.94">dropped another 8.2 percent in April</text>
  <text start="595.47" dur="5.4">after plunging 12 percent in March 23</text>
  <text start="598.26" dur="5.04">percent in February this is the biggest</text>
  <text start="600.87" dur="5.22">month over month plunging in the history</text>
  <text start="603.3" dur="6.39">of the index now when we look at the</text>
  <text start="606.09" dur="7.05">graph we can see that normally we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="609.69" dur="5.61">get over 6 on the index and all of a</text>
  <text start="613.14" dur="4.68">sudden with the Trump spike when he was</text>
  <text start="615.3" dur="4.65">elected we moved all the way up close to</text>
  <text start="617.82" dur="6.24">8 and a half and then we took the</text>
  <text start="619.95" dur="6.39">elevator down to about 4 and a half so</text>
  <text start="624.06" dur="3.45">something is going on here and remember</text>
  <text start="626.34" dur="3.45">a lot of these statistics are</text>
  <text start="627.51" dur="3.45">manipulated to make us think that things</text>
  <text start="629.79" dur="2.58">are doing a lot better than they really</text>
  <text start="630.96" dur="3.6">are but when we get down to the</text>
  <text start="632.37" dur="6.09">nitty-gritty we can see that housing</text>
  <text start="634.56" dur="7.17">while that&amp;#39;s falling apart the prices</text>
  <text start="638.46" dur="5.61">aren&amp;#39;t as high as everyone believes they</text>
  <text start="641.73" dur="5.16">are yes maybe in the 20 cities we see</text>

  <text start="653.58" dur="3.15">is going to start to accelerate now if</text>
  <text start="655.53" dur="3.51">you&amp;#39;re not seeing it in your area</text>
  <text start="656.73" dur="6.96">eventually it will hit remember prior to</text>
  <text start="659.04" dur="5.87">2008 Miami the Florida region they were</text>
  <text start="663.69" dur="3.99">seeing a boom in construction</text>
  <text start="664.91" dur="5.98">speculators all over the place up in the</text>
  <text start="667.68" dur="5.52">Northeast what was happening was the</text>
  <text start="670.89" dur="4.61">traffic was drying up now there was a</text>
  <text start="673.2" dur="5.55">six month or eight month lag before</text>
  <text start="675.5" dur="5.68">Florida even saw any of this and when</text>
  <text start="678.75" dur="3.66">they did they were hit really really</text>

  <text start="683.97" dur="4.68">halt and nobody was purchasing anything</text>

  <text start="692.28" dur="4.65">sales and everything just started to</text>
  <text start="694.41" dur="4.89">fall apart and with these 20 cities</text>
  <text start="696.93" dur="5.67">outside of the 20 cities we can see that</text>
  <text start="699.3" dur="4.77">traffic is not the way it used to be we</text>
  <text start="702.6" dur="3.96">see that mortgage rates are rising</text>
  <text start="704.07" dur="4.68">kicking more and more individuals out of</text>
  <text start="706.56" dur="5.04">the market so we see that things are</text>
  <text start="708.75" dur="5.82">rapidly changing right now especially in</text>
  <text start="711.6" dur="5.52">Canada that is going to spread all over</text>
  <text start="714.57" dur="5.64">the place and this is just the beginning</text>
  <text start="717.12" dur="6.6">we see that banks they are prepared</text>
  <text start="720.21" dur="5.58">for an economic catastrophe now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="723.72" dur="3.33">talked about Deutsche Bank before where</text>
  <text start="725.79" dur="4.47">they were gonna lay off about ten</text>
  <text start="727.05" dur="4.53">percent and they decided you know</text>
  <text start="730.26" dur="3.99">something ten percent is not enough</text>
  <text start="731.58" dur="4.62">we&amp;#39;re gonna raise this to 20 percent and</text>
  <text start="734.25" dur="4.08">it looks like they&amp;#39;re closing some</text>
  <text start="736.2" dur="3.449">offices here in the United States and I</text>
  <text start="738.33" dur="3.24">believe what&amp;#39;s going to happen here is a</text>
  <text start="739.649" dur="5.281">lot of banks are gonna do the same exact</text>
  <text start="741.57" dur="6.209">thing they are going to basically shut</text>
  <text start="744.93" dur="6.84">down many many offices lay off a lot of</text>
  <text start="747.779" dur="5.881">people to get ahead of what is about to</text>
  <text start="751.77" dur="5.069">happen and that is an economic</text>
  <text start="753.66" dur="6.75">catastrophe and we might even see these</text>

  <text start="760.41" dur="4.41">are right now they might even go up to</text>
  <text start="761.91" dur="4.98">25 30 percent we saw this back in 2008</text>
  <text start="764.82" dur="3.99">where all of a sudden everyone had a job</text>
  <text start="766.89" dur="3.96">everything was fine all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="768.81" dur="3.3">market came down and the companies were</text>
  <text start="770.85" dur="4.41">out there saying hey we&amp;#39;re just gonna</text>
  <text start="772.11" dur="4.2">lay off thousands of people and you</text>
  <text start="775.26" dur="3.57">don&amp;#39;t think the same thing is gonna</text>
  <text start="776.31" dur="5.13">happen once again I mean these</text>
  <text start="778.83" dur="4.47">corporations their profits they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="781.44" dur="5.399">making any they&amp;#39;re buying back their</text>
  <text start="783.3" dur="6.3">stocks retail corporations going out a</text>
  <text start="786.839" dur="5.881">business like crazy a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="789.6" dur="6">space from retail is opening up the</text>
  <text start="792.72" dur="5.1">housing bubble is popping the rest of</text>

  <text start="797.82" dur="4.8">the GDP and everything else the</text>
  <text start="801.029" dur="5.191">completely fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="802.62" dur="7.37">so basically we&amp;#39;re at that point right</text>
  <text start="806.22" dur="7.14">now where everything is starting to turn</text>
  <text start="809.99" dur="6.219">downward we hit the plateau we&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="813.36" dur="5.64">over the plateau and now we&amp;#39;re declining</text>
  <text start="816.209" dur="5.311">and we&amp;#39;re gonna see things rapidly fall</text>
  <text start="819" dur="5.13">apart Trump and the Patriots they know</text>
  <text start="821.52" dur="4.68">this the central bankers know this they</text>
  <text start="824.13" dur="3.3">know their illusion would only last for</text>
  <text start="826.2" dur="3">a certain period of time before</text>
  <text start="827.43" dur="4.05">everything started to fall apart by</text>
  <text start="829.2" dur="3.81">itself and again the central bankers</text>
  <text start="831.48" dur="4.5">would like to bring the economy down and</text>
