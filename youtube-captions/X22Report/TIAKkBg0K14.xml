  <text start="169.189" dur="9.39">oil using the dollar and this was plan</text>
  <text start="173.54" dur="9.27">in the 60s and in 1971 Nixon came out</text>
  <text start="178.579" dur="6.36">and he said the following accordingly I</text>
  <text start="182.81" dur="4.98">have directed the Secretary of the</text>
  <text start="184.939" dur="4.83">Treasury to take the action necessary to</text>
  <text start="187.79" dur="4.38">defend the dollar against the</text>
  <text start="189.769" dur="4.53">speculators I have directed secretary</text>

  <text start="203.209" dur="7.441">and in the best interest of the United</text>
  <text start="205.79" dur="8.629">States now what is this action which is</text>
  <text start="210.65" dur="6.509">very technical what does it mean for you</text>
  <text start="214.419" dur="8.8">let me rate a rat late arrest the</text>
  <text start="217.159" dur="8.851">Bugaboo of what is called devaluation if</text>
  <text start="223.219" dur="5.431">you want to buy a foreign car or take a</text>
  <text start="226.01" dur="7.289">trip abroad market conditions may cause</text>
  <text start="228.65" dur="7.229">your dollar to buy slightly less but if</text>
  <text start="233.299" dur="5.16">you are among the overwhelming majority</text>
  <text start="235.879" dur="5.94">of Americans who buy american-made</text>
  <text start="238.459" dur="5.34">products in America your dollar will be</text>
  <text start="241.819" dur="5.431">worth just as much tomorrow as it is</text>
  <text start="243.799" dur="6.36">today the effect of this action in other</text>
  <text start="247.25" dur="6.59">words will be to stabilize the dollar</text>
  <text start="250.159" dur="7.92">now what Nixon was saying was we are</text>
  <text start="253.84" dur="8.35">taking the economy and we are now doing</text>
  <text start="258.079" dur="7.441">away with the gold bang economy we are</text>
  <text start="262.19" dur="5.94">now moving to this new economy and he</text>
  <text start="265.52" dur="4.56">explains that the dollar is going to be</text>
  <text start="268.13" dur="3.509">devalued but don&amp;#39;t worry about that</text>
  <text start="270.08" dur="3.6">everything&amp;#39;s going to be fine</text>
  <text start="271.639" dur="3.21">you won&amp;#39;t even notice anything well</text>
  <text start="273.68" dur="3.57">unless you&amp;#39;re traveling outside the</text>
  <text start="274.849" dur="5.211">country but inside the country you will</text>
  <text start="277.25" dur="5.639">notice a thing he didn&amp;#39;t tell us that</text>
  <text start="280.06" dur="5.62">years later it was going to get worse</text>
  <text start="282.889" dur="6.181">and worse and worse he left that whole</text>
  <text start="285.68" dur="6.06">part out now when we look at the economy</text>
  <text start="289.07" dur="5.459">today the central bank economy we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="291.74" dur="4.539">the end stage and when we look at it you</text>
  <text start="294.529" dur="5.19">can see how everything</text>
  <text start="296.279" dur="7.05">has deteriorated very very quickly and</text>
  <text start="299.719" dur="5.98">it accelerates as we get closer and</text>
  <text start="303.329" dur="3.9">closer to the end now of course since</text>
  <text start="305.699" dur="3.2">2008 what they&amp;#39;ve been doing is they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="307.229" dur="4.29">been kicking the can down the street</text>
  <text start="308.899" dur="4.93">they thought they had a different plan</text>
  <text start="311.519" dur="4.95">in mind they never thought that Trump</text>
  <text start="313.829" dur="5.55">was going to win but when you look at</text>
  <text start="316.469" dur="6.24">the central bank system today you can</text>
  <text start="319.379" dur="6.39">see how it&amp;#39;s ripping itself apart just</text>
  <text start="322.709" dur="6.21">look at the real estate market look at</text>
  <text start="325.769" dur="6.12">the retail market remember 71 percent of</text>
  <text start="328.919" dur="5.67">GDP is made up of the everyday person</text>
  <text start="331.889" dur="5.49">spending money and when you look at the</text>
  <text start="334.589" dur="5.61">retail market you can see that it is</text>
  <text start="337.379" dur="6.9">being ripped apart like we&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="340.199" dur="5.34">before and we see there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="344.279" dur="2.67">stores closing you I know a lot of</text>
  <text start="345.539" dur="3.24">people think oh what&amp;#39;s going to online</text>
  <text start="346.949" dur="4.77">but when you look at online sales it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="348.779" dur="3.27">not a 1:1 ratio we&amp;#39;re not seeing this at</text>
  <text start="351.719" dur="3.33">all</text>
  <text start="352.049" dur="5.88">every time a store closes all the sales</text>
  <text start="355.049" dur="7.8">don&amp;#39;t go to Amazon remember all these</text>
  <text start="357.929" dur="6.78">stores have an online presence but the</text>
  <text start="362.849" dur="5.73">stores can&amp;#39;t make it because people</text>
  <text start="364.709" dur="6.21">aren&amp;#39;t purchasing and think about it</text>
  <text start="368.579" dur="6.18">the interest rates are the lowest we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="370.919" dur="7.34">ever seen it forever 21 they filed for</text>
  <text start="374.759" dur="6.54">chapter 11 protection they can&amp;#39;t make it</text>
  <text start="378.259" dur="7.36">now they&amp;#39;re gonna try to make it but</text>
  <text start="381.299" dur="7.89">once again this was a huge chain they</text>
  <text start="385.619" dur="8.01">had many many stores and they&amp;#39;ve been in</text>
  <text start="389.189" dur="6.78">operation since something like 1984 so</text>
  <text start="393.629" dur="7.62">when you look at this you can see that</text>
  <text start="395.969" dur="6.93">in today&amp;#39;s world people are not spending</text>
  <text start="401.249" dur="3.45">a lot of these stores are in a lot of</text>
  <text start="402.899" dur="5.1">debt even though the interest rates are</text>
  <text start="404.699" dur="5.34">very very low they cannot make it and if</text>
  <text start="407.999" dur="4.5">you go back in time and we discussed</text>
  <text start="410.039" dur="4.08">this many times before you can see</text>
  <text start="412.499" dur="4.05">there&amp;#39;s a lot of stores that went</text>
  <text start="414.119" dur="5.13">completely belly-up they went out of</text>
  <text start="416.549" dur="5.37">business and there were going to be more</text>
  <text start="419.249" dur="4.89">and more stores that are gonna go</text>
  <text start="421.919" dur="5.67">completely out of business and many of</text>
  <text start="424.139" dur="4.901">these big chains they do have an online</text>
  <text start="427.589" dur="4.121">presence</text>
  <text start="429.04" dur="4.44">if online was the key they would say you</text>
  <text start="431.71" dur="4.16">know something we&amp;#39;re just gonna stick</text>
  <text start="433.48" dur="5.85">the online and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ll do</text>
  <text start="435.87" dur="7.09">we&amp;#39;ll regroup shut the stores and just</text>
  <text start="439.33" dur="5.85">do online but guess what they know</text>
  <text start="442.96" dur="6.09">that&amp;#39;s not the answer they know that</text>
  <text start="445.18" dur="7.35">people are not purchasing that is the</text>
  <text start="449.05" dur="6.3">main problem and don&amp;#39;t get confused with</text>
  <text start="452.53" dur="4.92">what&amp;#39;s happening today with Trump and</text>
  <text start="455.35" dur="4.71">what he&amp;#39;s trying to do there are two</text>
  <text start="457.45" dur="6.57">separate things just like back in the</text>
  <text start="460.06" dur="6.15">70s we had two separate things now we</text>
  <text start="464.02" dur="3.8">know that the central bank economy has</text>
  <text start="466.21" dur="4.89">been kicked down the road since</text>
  <text start="467.82" dur="6.58">2008-2009 when the entire system came to</text>
  <text start="471.1" dur="5.67">a screeching halt basically the system</text>
  <text start="474.4" dur="4.14">doesn&amp;#39;t work anymore over the years the</text>
  <text start="476.77" dur="3.98">central bank in the government they</text>
  <text start="478.54" dur="6.21">needed to manipulate almost everything</text>
  <text start="480.75" dur="7.14">that we see in the economy they needed</text>
  <text start="484.75" dur="6.21">to manipulate everything think about it</text>
  <text start="487.89" dur="4.9">unemployment the calculation has changed</text>
  <text start="490.96" dur="4.89">many many times why they needed to</text>
  <text start="492.79" dur="5.31">manipulate that the GDP is calculated</text>
  <text start="495.85" dur="3.87">completely differently than it was in</text>
  <text start="498.1" dur="4.62">the past why because they needed to</text>
  <text start="499.72" dur="5.49">manipulate it the stock market that is</text>
  <text start="502.72" dur="5.82">manipulated we have central banks around</text>
  <text start="505.21" dur="6.81">the world that are purchasing stocks we</text>
  <text start="508.54" dur="5.46">have the plunge Protection Team we have</text>
  <text start="512.02" dur="4.17">somewhere in the basement of the Federal</text>
  <text start="514" dur="5.099">Reserve where they&amp;#39;re able to control</text>
  <text start="516.19" dur="6.03">what the stock market does we have the</text>
  <text start="519.099" dur="6.991">manipulation of precious metals they</text>
  <text start="522.22" dur="5.46">manipulate the interest rates and the</text>
  <text start="526.09" dur="7.02">amount of currency that is pumped into</text>
  <text start="527.68" dur="8.61">the economy is ongoing since 2008-2009</text>
  <text start="533.11" dur="7.58">this is what they call stimulus all of</text>
  <text start="536.29" dur="9.6">this is manipulation an open free market</text>
  <text start="540.69" dur="7.27">doesn&amp;#39;t need this type of manipulation</text>
  <text start="545.89" dur="4.2">the only reason you would need this type</text>
  <text start="547.96" dur="6.57">of manipulation is when you&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="550.09" dur="9.54">control it so it doesn&amp;#39;t crash that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="554.53" dur="8.61">why they&amp;#39;re doing this and remember we</text>
  <text start="559.63" dur="7.4">haven&amp;#39;t had an audit of the goal</text>
  <text start="563.14" dur="7.53">reserves in a very very long time</text>
  <text start="567.03" dur="8.11">when was the last time the goal reserves</text>
  <text start="570.67" dur="7.8">were actually audited now back in 74</text>
  <text start="575.14" dur="5.97">they said that they&amp;#39;ve done a complete</text>
  <text start="578.47" dur="7.65">audit but they really didn&amp;#39;t look at all</text>
  <text start="581.11" dur="8.21">the gold in 1953 it was a somewhat</text>
  <text start="586.12" dur="6.48">credible examination of Fort Knox&amp;#39;s gold</text>
  <text start="589.32" dur="4.9">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting his</text>
  <text start="592.6" dur="3.42">representative Alex Mooney</text>
  <text start="594.22" dur="6.05">he introduced the gold reserve</text>
  <text start="596.02" dur="8.19">transparency act and we would like a</text>
  <text start="600.27" dur="9.79">audit of the gold that is in Fort Knox</text>
  <text start="604.21" dur="10.74">now once again why has the central bank</text>
  <text start="610.06" dur="8.97">refused an audit of their accounting</text>
  <text start="614.95" dur="8.66">system and why haven&amp;#39;t we audited the</text>
  <text start="619.03" dur="9.18">gold in Fort Knox what is the purpose of</text>
  <text start="623.61" dur="7.51">keeping it a secret because it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="628.21" dur="7.59">manipulation when you don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="631.12" dur="8.79">gold in that location when the Federal</text>
  <text start="635.8" dur="8.16">Reserve is doing things illegally you</text>
  <text start="639.91" dur="6.11">can&amp;#39;t allow an audit now if the central</text>
  <text start="643.96" dur="5.55">bank system is so fantastic</text>
  <text start="646.02" dur="5.38">why so much manipulation why can&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="649.51" dur="4.65">American people see the inner workings</text>
  <text start="651.4" dur="5.79">of the Fed why can&amp;#39;t the American people</text>
  <text start="654.16" dur="5.9">see the gold in Fort Knox with a full</text>
  <text start="657.19" dur="6.84">audit to make sure all is accounted for</text>
  <text start="660.06" dur="6.94">remember this is a people system the</text>
  <text start="664.03" dur="5.61">people are in control it&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="667" dur="5.24">Federal Reserve it&amp;#39;s not the government</text>
  <text start="669.64" dur="7.58">it&amp;#39;s the people</text>
  <text start="672.24" dur="7.829">the people are the controlling force and</text>
  <text start="677.22" dur="4.2">there&amp;#39;s a reason why we have all the</text>
  <text start="680.069" dur="4.83">secrecy the central bank in the deep</text>
  <text start="681.42" dur="6.87">state their plan was much different than</text>
  <text start="684.899" dur="6.36">what is happening today the plan was to</text>
  <text start="688.29" dur="4.469">cover it all up like they do everything</text>
  <text start="691.259" dur="3.901">else the mainstream media would never</text>
  <text start="692.759" dur="5.58">mention it nobody would bring it up it</text>
  <text start="695.16" dur="7.2">would just all disappear how would this</text>
  <text start="698.339" dur="7.29">happen an event a war but everything has</text>
  <text start="702.36" dur="6.229">changed they are no longer in power all</text>
  <text start="705.629" dur="6.33">the secrecy is about to end and</text>
  <text start="708.589" dur="5.17">transparency is going to take over which</text>
  <text start="711.959" dur="6.81">will lead us to the truth</text>
  <text start="713.759" dur="8.461">remember in Q&amp;#39;s post 33:26 when q talks</text>
  <text start="718.769" dur="6.331">about truth transparency equal justice</text>
  <text start="722.22" dur="4.739">under the law well this just doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="725.1" dur="7.169">have to do with the swamp its</text>
