  <text start="105.53" dur="5.18">economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="107.929" dur="6.48">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about the blockchain</text>
  <text start="110.71" dur="5.89">cryptocurrency and the different corns</text>
  <text start="114.409" dur="4.111">and we know the central bankers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="116.6" dur="5.43">completely opposed to this and this is</text>
  <text start="118.52" dur="6.51">why they created this environment where</text>
  <text start="122.03" dur="5.82">people think that bitcoin and other</text>
  <text start="125.03" dur="5.97">coins and the blockchain they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="127.85" dur="5.22">used in criminal activity terrorists use</text>
  <text start="131" dur="4.799">it and they&amp;#39;ve been building this up</text>
  <text start="133.07" dur="7.08">over time the reason for this is because</text>
  <text start="135.799" dur="7.321">they don&amp;#39;t want people using a different</text>
  <text start="140.15" dur="4.83">system one which they cannot control</text>
  <text start="143.12" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re very nervous and afraid of this</text>
  <text start="144.98" dur="5.759">and the Chinese came out with a report</text>
  <text start="147.98" dur="5.539">saying yeah criminal activity with the</text>
  <text start="150.739" dur="7.051">crypto market really non-existent and</text>
  <text start="153.519" dur="7.181">here in the US an agent of the US Drug</text>
  <text start="157.79" dur="3.81">Enforcement Administration DEA has noted</text>
  <text start="160.7" dur="3.45">that bitcoins</text>
  <text start="161.6" dur="6.479">role in crimes has dropped to just 10%</text>
  <text start="164.15" dur="7.28">of transactions while transactions</text>
  <text start="168.079" dur="8.551">themselves have grown tremendously and</text>
  <text start="171.43" dur="7.48">this is DEA Special Agent Lalita Infante</text>
  <text start="176.63" dur="4.65">who is a member of the 10-person cyber</text>
  <text start="178.91" dur="5.46">investigation Task Force said that the</text>
  <text start="181.28" dur="5.22">ratio of legitimate to illegitimate</text>
  <text start="184.37" dur="4.74">Bitcoin transactions have</text>
  <text start="186.5" dur="5.97">flipped over the past five years because</text>
  <text start="189.11" dur="5.22">y-you can track everything that has been</text>
  <text start="192.47" dur="5.79">done and it makes it very very difficult</text>
  <text start="194.33" dur="6.66">to hide the coins they can be found out</text>
  <text start="198.26" dur="3.51">you know what the address is it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="200.99" dur="3.719">difficult to do</text>
  <text start="201.77" dur="4.5">compared to cash where you don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="204.709" dur="3.781">where any of that is it could be</text>
  <text start="206.27" dur="5.189">anywhere and that&amp;#39;s why you see money</text>
  <text start="208.49" dur="5.43">laundering with cash this is why the</text>
  <text start="211.459" dur="5.401">drug dealers use cash this is why the</text>
  <text start="213.92" dur="4.31">intelligence agencies use cash because</text>
  <text start="216.86" dur="3.99">they know they can get away with it</text>
  <text start="218.23" dur="5.53">really the blockchain the</text>
  <text start="220.85" dur="6.06">cryptocurrencies it&amp;#39;s very difficult to</text>
  <text start="223.76" dur="4.65">use this and to succeed in a criminal</text>
  <text start="226.91" dur="3.42">activity because eventually what will</text>
  <text start="228.41" dur="4.2">happen it could all be traced if you</text>
  <text start="230.33" dur="5.129">really wanted to look for it and the</text>
  <text start="232.61" dur="5.129">central bank&amp;#39;s they knew this all along</text>
  <text start="235.459" dur="3.811">but they use this to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="237.739" dur="4.561">and to demonize it and make everyone</text>
  <text start="239.27" dur="4.65">think that this was a huge problem and</text>
  <text start="242.3" dur="4.17">then of course what they did was they</text>
  <text start="243.92" dur="5.97">manipulated it they and again we said</text>
  <text start="246.47" dur="5.82">this way way back where they were buying</text>
  <text start="249.89" dur="5.129">a lot of the coins and all they had to</text>
  <text start="252.29" dur="6.15">do is sell them to drop the price so</text>
  <text start="255.019" dur="4.951">they really fixed the system just like</text>
  <text start="258.44" dur="4.92">they did with precious metals and they</text>
  <text start="259.97" dur="6.09">do this to force everyone away from it</text>
  <text start="263.36" dur="4.559">now if you want to hear the truth or</text>
  <text start="266.06" dur="4.98">understand what cryptocurrencies are</text>
  <text start="267.919" dur="7.5">what the blockchain is well you can go</text>

  <text start="314.69" dur="4.89">can read all about it here in the United</text>
  <text start="317.15" dur="4.95">States what are we seeing well</text>
  <text start="319.58" dur="4.26">the BLS is out there and the jobs report</text>
  <text start="322.1" dur="6.9">is out there and they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="323.84" dur="6.84">about the development of jobs and there</text>
  <text start="329" dur="5.04">was a surprising development back in</text>
  <text start="330.68" dur="5.37">June when jolts report revealed a</text>
  <text start="334.04" dur="5.43">curious inflection point for the first</text>
  <text start="336.05" dur="6.42">time in reported BLS data the number of</text>
  <text start="339.47" dur="5.73">US job openings surpassed the number of</text>
  <text start="342.47" dur="6.54">unemployed workers now if we fast</text>
  <text start="345.2" dur="6.17">forward two months the BLS reported on</text>
  <text start="349.01" dur="6.54">Friday the number of unemployed workers</text>
  <text start="351.37" dur="7.48">increased from six million to 6.3</text>
  <text start="355.55" dur="5.4">million the question was whether this</text>
  <text start="358.85" dur="5.07">increase would also reverse this opening</text>
  <text start="360.95" dur="5.46">unemployment trend well guess what the</text>
  <text start="363.92" dur="3.33">jolts report came out for the third</text>
  <text start="366.41" dur="3.39">month in a row</text>
  <text start="367.25" dur="5.66">the number of job openings state above</text>
  <text start="369.8" dur="6.21">the total number of unemployed workers</text>
  <text start="372.91" dur="4.96">this means that June was the third</text>
  <text start="376.01" dur="4.68">consecutive month in which the number of</text>
  <text start="377.87" dur="5.46">job openings was higher than the number</text>
  <text start="380.69" dur="4.89">of unemployed Americans in other words</text>
  <text start="383.33" dur="4.29">if an economy in which there was a</text>
  <text start="385.58" dur="4.26">perfect match between worker skills and</text>
  <text start="387.62" dur="4.71">employer needs there would be zero</text>
  <text start="389.84" dur="5.37">unemployed people at this moment which</text>
  <text start="392.33" dur="4.41">of course is not the case according to</text>
  <text start="395.21" dur="3.39">the historical correlation between the</text>
  <text start="396.74" dur="4.68">number of hires and the 12-month</text>
  <text start="398.6" dur="5.16">cumulative job change per the</text>
  <text start="401.42" dur="4.59">establishment survey either the pace of</text>
  <text start="403.76" dur="4.2">hiring needs to drop or else the number</text>
  <text start="406.01" dur="4.14">of new jobs will rise significantly in</text>
  <text start="407.96" dur="5">the coming months now we need to</text>
  <text start="410.15" dur="5.73">understand how this is all figured out</text>
  <text start="412.96" dur="5.41">once again those companies that have</text>
  <text start="415.88" dur="4.17">these open job wrecks and if you ever</text>
  <text start="418.37" dur="3.63">worked in a company in a department you</text>
  <text start="420.05" dur="3.36">understand you don&amp;#39;t like to lose those</text>
  <text start="422" dur="4.59">because you never get them back</text>
  <text start="423.41" dur="5.7">so they might be open but there also</text>
  <text start="426.59" dur="4.17">might be a job freeze from upper</text>
  <text start="429.11" dur="3.93">management where they say you can</text>
  <text start="430.76" dur="5.22">interview keep the job openings there</text>
  <text start="433.04" dur="5.34">keep the recs there but you just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="435.98" dur="5.04">hire anyone so when they come around to</text>
  <text start="438.38" dur="6.48">report how many open wrecks do you have</text>
  <text start="441.02" dur="5.73">well we have 10 oh ok so there&amp;#39;s 10 job</text>
  <text start="444.86" dur="3.54">openings here then they go to the next</text>
  <text start="446.75" dur="3.93">department how many do you have and then</text>
  <text start="448.4" dur="5.2">the company reports it but the problem</text>
  <text start="450.68" dur="5.89">is they didn&amp;#39;t tell you about the freeze</text>
  <text start="453.6" dur="4.29">that means you can&amp;#39;t hire on hire anyone</text>
  <text start="456.57" dur="6.5">even though you have the job</text>
  <text start="457.89" dur="8.4">Rex now once again if there are so many</text>
  <text start="463.07" dur="6.82">openings and not enough employees well</text>
  <text start="466.29" dur="6.81">wouldn&amp;#39;t you see wages move up wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="469.89" dur="5.37">you give some type of incentive to get</text>
  <text start="473.1" dur="3.66">the workers in because there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="475.26" dur="5.58">shortage that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="476.76" dur="5.7">supply demand I mean we saw this back in</text>
  <text start="480.84" dur="4.02">the tech boom there was a shortage of</text>
  <text start="482.46" dur="4.26">tech individuals lot of openings for</text>
  <text start="484.86" dur="2.19">tech jobs you saw them all over the</text>
  <text start="486.72" dur="2.52">place</text>
  <text start="487.05" dur="4.38">salaries went up and up and up and up</text>
  <text start="489.24" dur="4.98">why you needed to attract more and more</text>
  <text start="491.43" dur="5.94">people here we are not seeing that so</text>
  <text start="494.22" dur="5.49">there is a problem now if you look at</text>
  <text start="497.37" dur="4.41">the job hires verse 12-month cumulative</text>
  <text start="499.71" dur="4.44">change in payrolls and you look at the</text>
  <text start="501.78" dur="4.95">graph you can see we are at that point</text>
  <text start="504.15" dur="4.92">in now the graph is really going in a</text>
  <text start="506.73" dur="2.85">weird direction that we&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="509.07" dur="5.27">before</text>
  <text start="509.58" dur="8.97">because right prior to 2008 both the</text>
  <text start="514.34" dur="7.24">12-month job change and hires there were</text>
  <text start="518.55" dur="4.83">pretty closely related they went up they</text>
  <text start="521.58" dur="2.88">hit a certain point they both started to</text>
  <text start="523.38" dur="2.76">come down and come down really really</text>
  <text start="524.46" dur="4.17">fast because we entered a Great</text>
  <text start="526.14" dur="5.13">Recession now they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="528.63" dur="5.67">separate and apart and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="531.27" dur="6.89">here is that the 12-month job change</text>
  <text start="534.3" dur="8.04">it&amp;#39;s starting to decline and the hires</text>
  <text start="538.16" dur="6.36">well that is moving up this is very odd</text>
  <text start="542.34" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;ve never really seen this before and</text>
  <text start="544.52" dur="6.52">what this tells us is that this whole</text>
  <text start="547.68" dur="4.58">thing is completely manipulated to the</text>
  <text start="551.04" dur="3.18">nth degree</text>
  <text start="552.26" dur="5.38">everything that we&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="554.22" dur="6.33">entire economy is manipulated this is</text>
  <text start="557.64" dur="5.25">why the Fed is getting rid of the yield</text>
  <text start="560.55" dur="4.92">curve or changing the calculation</text>
  <text start="562.89" dur="5.1">getting rid of when they dump their</text>
  <text start="565.47" dur="5.01">assets from their balance sheet their</text>
  <text start="567.99" dur="5.55">job indicator graph they got rid of that</text>
  <text start="570.48" dur="4.62">they don&amp;#39;t want anyone to realize what</text>
  <text start="573.54" dur="3.51">is really going on here because things</text>
  <text start="575.1" dur="4.11">really don&amp;#39;t make sense now we have the</text>
  <text start="577.05" dur="4.92">manipulation of GDP savings and</text>
  <text start="579.21" dur="3.84">everything else well everything doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="581.97" dur="3.63">make sense because when you manipulate</text>
  <text start="583.05" dur="4.32">everything and it&amp;#39;s not based on reality</text>
  <text start="585.6" dur="5.22">well nothing makes sense</text>
  <text start="587.37" dur="6.48">but one thing we do know is that the 1%</text>
  <text start="590.82" dur="5.64">of America they haven&amp;#39;t controlled this</text>
  <text start="593.85" dur="5.13">much wealth since before the Great</text>
  <text start="596.46" dur="4.98">Depression now the gap between rich and</text>
  <text start="598.98" dur="5.94">poor in America has ballooned over the</text>
  <text start="601.44" dur="6.06">several decades in 2015 the top 1% of</text>
  <text start="604.92" dur="4.98">American made 26 point three times as</text>
  <text start="607.5" dur="5.25">much income as the bottom 99% an</text>
  <text start="609.9" dur="4.68">increase from 2013 when they earned</text>
  <text start="612.75" dur="3.72">twenty five point three times as much</text>
  <text start="614.58" dur="4.23">according to a recent study released by</text>
  <text start="616.47" dur="4.8">the Economic Policy Institute so when we</text>
  <text start="618.81" dur="4.56">look at this we see that a family needed</text>
  <text start="621.27" dur="3.509">an annual income about four hundred and</text>
  <text start="623.37" dur="3.95">twenty one thousand nine hundred twenty</text>
  <text start="624.779" dur="5.581">six dollars to be part of the 1%</text>
  <text start="627.32" dur="5.38">nationally but in some states the</text>
  <text start="630.36" dur="5.22">threshold was higher the top 1% of</text>
  <text start="632.7" dur="4.29">Americans took home more than 22% of all</text>
  <text start="635.58" dur="5">income in 2015</text>
  <text start="636.99" dur="8.3">that&amp;#39;s the highest share since a peak of</text>
  <text start="640.58" dur="9.49">23.9 just before the Great Depression in</text>
  <text start="645.29" dur="8.58">1928 and we&amp;#39;re back where we started now</text>
  <text start="650.07" dur="7.23">remember most of the people today well</text>
  <text start="653.87" dur="5.29">they have a lot of credit card debt they</text>
  <text start="657.3" dur="5.24">don&amp;#39;t have a lot of savings they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="659.16" dur="6">even have enough for an emergency and</text>
  <text start="662.54" dur="5.32">actually they have less than $1,000 in</text>
  <text start="665.16" dur="4.74">their account even though the savings</text>
  <text start="667.86" dur="3.78">rate was completely revised and</text>
  <text start="669.9" dur="3.629">manipulated to make us think that people</text>
  <text start="671.64" dur="4.02">had a lot more in their accounts this</text>
  <text start="673.529" dur="4.111">way the Fed again would move up the</text>
  <text start="675.66" dur="3.45">interest rates this is the whole plan</text>
  <text start="677.64" dur="5.79">here we talked about this in the last</text>
  <text start="679.11" dur="8.849">report we see that in reality it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="683.43" dur="8.09">jiving what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a</text>
  <text start="687.959" dur="6.511">huge push to control the narrative and</text>
  <text start="691.52" dur="4.18">we talked about both sides and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="694.47" dur="1.44">seeing it play out right in front of our</text>
  <text start="695.7" dur="1.92">eyes</text>
  <text start="695.91" dur="3.03">I mean the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="697.62" dur="2.64">mainstream media they don&amp;#39;t even know</text>
  <text start="698.94" dur="3.78">how to make sense of this anymore</text>
  <text start="700.26" dur="5.46">because they were on the path of saying</text>
  <text start="702.72" dur="5.67">okay Trump the economy&amp;#39;s gonna start to</text>
  <text start="705.72" dur="5.22">fall apart and we&amp;#39;re going to blame it</text>
  <text start="708.39" dur="4.71">on him because we knew that the economy</text>
  <text start="710.94" dur="4.41">was fake phony and false we knew that if</text>
  <text start="713.1" dur="4.109">he put tariffs in place the central</text>
  <text start="715.35" dur="4.25">bankers would bring it down we blame it</text>
  <text start="717.209" dur="4.531">on Trump but things have changed</text>
  <text start="719.6" dur="8.82">everything was recount</text>
  <text start="721.74" dur="9.26">GDP it doubled the savings rate doubled</text>
  <text start="728.42" dur="5.49">unemployment dropping like a rock</text>
  <text start="731" dur="5.41">now the mainstream media&amp;#39;s out there and</text>
  <text start="733.91" dur="4.39">they&amp;#39;re saying okay the economy is not</text>
  <text start="736.41" dur="3.54">doing poorly we can&amp;#39;t blame the Sun</text>
  <text start="738.3" dur="4.11">Trump we thought it&amp;#39;d be collapsing by</text>
  <text start="739.95" dur="5.55">now and this was the plan what is going</text>
  <text start="742.41" dur="6.51">on here so now and you can see this on</text>
  <text start="745.5" dur="5.34">CNN where they&amp;#39;re out there saying well</text>
  <text start="748.92" dur="3.42">the reason why the economy is doing so</text>
  <text start="750.84" dur="4.14">well is because Trump inherited from</text>
  <text start="752.34" dur="5.19">Obama Obama handed off an incredible</text>
  <text start="754.98" dur="5.46">economy and this is why everything is</text>
  <text start="757.53" dur="5.52">going the way it is no that&amp;#39;s not what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="760.44" dur="7.41">happening here what&amp;#39;s happening here is</text>
  <text start="763.05" dur="7.26">a huge push to control the narrative of</text>
  <text start="767.85" dur="4.35">what&amp;#39;s going to happen now is Trump and</text>
  <text start="770.31" dur="2.91">the Patriots themselves going to bring</text>
  <text start="772.2" dur="4.29">down the economy know they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="773.22" dur="6.3">force someone else to bring down the</text>
  <text start="776.49" dur="5.34">economy but they&amp;#39;re going to control the</text>
  <text start="779.52" dur="4.41">narrative we talked about yesterday why</text>
  <text start="781.83" dur="4.17">the GDP numbers the savings rate and</text>
  <text start="783.93" dur="4.17">everything else was manipulated to make</text>
  <text start="786" dur="4.14">it look like the economy is doing the</text>
  <text start="788.1" dur="5.19">best that it&amp;#39;s ever been even in reality</text>
  <text start="790.14" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s not doing that it&amp;#39;s to force the</text>
  <text start="793.29" dur="3.48">central bank it&amp;#39;s to force the Federal</text>
  <text start="794.91" dur="3.6">Reserve to raise interest rates and you</text>
  <text start="796.77" dur="4.23">can see right now the Fed is out there</text>
  <text start="798.51" dur="4.11">and some of the Fed pundants are out</text>
  <text start="801" dur="3.39">there saying well we don&amp;#39;t have to raise</text>
  <text start="802.62" dur="4.17">the interest rates even though the</text>
  <text start="804.39" dur="4.89">economy looks much much stronger than we</text>
  <text start="806.79" dur="4.47">even reported and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="809.28" dur="3.9">figure our way out of this but they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="811.26" dur="4.14">been saying for such a long time they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="813.18" dur="4.01">going to raise rates if the GDP looks</text>
  <text start="815.4" dur="5.04">good unemployment is at the lowest and</text>
  <text start="817.19" dur="6.19">the economy is very strong they fell</text>
  <text start="820.44" dur="4.89">right into this trap and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="823.38" dur="3.87">to get themselves out of it but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="825.33" dur="5.1">going to be very very difficult to do</text>
  <text start="827.25" dur="6.42">this and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is the setup</text>
  <text start="830.43" dur="4.65">what&amp;#39;s coming is the next phase we</text>
  <text start="833.67" dur="3.63">already see coming out of the Wall</text>
  <text start="835.08" dur="5.76">Street Journal and this is about Senator</text>
  <text start="837.3" dur="6.03">Rand Paul where he&amp;#39;s out there pushing</text>
  <text start="840.84" dur="5.01">the idea of an audit once again and of</text>
  <text start="843.33" dur="4.95">course he&amp;#39;s trying to persuade those</text>
  <text start="845.85" dur="5.49">individuals in Congress to go along with</text>
  <text start="848.28" dur="4.2">this and he&amp;#39;s saying that the Fed will</text>
  <text start="851.34" dur="2.4">never know what they&amp;#39;re really doing</text>
  <text start="852.48" dur="3.06">because this</text>
  <text start="853.74" dur="4.2">destroying a lot of their documents and</text>
  <text start="855.54" dur="6.15">we can&amp;#39;t audit them and this is the</text>
  <text start="857.94" dur="5.79">beginning step towards the next phase</text>
  <text start="861.69" dur="4.92">where they&amp;#39;re going to start to make a</text>
  <text start="863.73" dur="6.39">case of why we need to go and look at</text>
  <text start="866.61" dur="5.64">the Fed and this time it is very very</text>
  <text start="870.12" dur="4.8">different from all the other times</text>
  <text start="872.25" dur="5.55">because back then we didn&amp;#39;t have an</text>
  <text start="874.92" dur="5.22">actual individual who really wants to</text>
  <text start="877.8" dur="6.12">audit the Fed who wants to get this done</text>
  <text start="880.14" dur="7.92">to take over the central bank now we do</text>
  <text start="883.92" dur="7.5">it&amp;#39;s already set q has been mentioning</text>
  <text start="888.06" dur="7.14">it Trump already came out and laid the</text>
  <text start="891.42" dur="6.54">groundwork to set up the Fed the Fed has</text>
  <text start="895.2" dur="4.68">no choice right now they&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="897.96" dur="4.35">to probably raise rates the next time</text>
  <text start="899.88" dur="4.38">they froze it this time I mean yes they</text>
  <text start="902.31" dur="3.99">can make excuses they can say oh one</text>
  <text start="904.26" dur="4.59">more time and all they&amp;#39;ll do is they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="906.3" dur="5.4">bring the GDP up to 5% they&amp;#39;ll bring the</text>
  <text start="908.85" dur="4.62">unemployment down to 3% they&amp;#39;ll say the</text>
  <text start="911.7" dur="4.41">savings rate is incredible they&amp;#39;ll make</text>
  <text start="913.47" dur="4.77">the economy look like it has never been</text>
  <text start="916.11" dur="5.13">like this ever ever before in history</text>
  <text start="918.24" dur="6.12">where it&amp;#39;s so incredible why do we have</text>
  <text start="921.24" dur="6.12">such low interest rates and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="924.36" dur="6.66">going to force the Fed into raising the</text>
  <text start="927.36" dur="6.69">rates the Fed is going to crash the</text>
  <text start="931.02" dur="6.21">economy they&amp;#39;re being pushed to crash</text>
  <text start="934.05" dur="7.14">the economy so Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="937.23" dur="7.38">can control the narrative to set them up</text>
  <text start="941.19" dur="6.21">to go in to take control to audit them</text>
  <text start="944.61" dur="5.4">to see what they&amp;#39;ve been doing to find</text>
  <text start="947.4" dur="6.78">out and tell the American people what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="950.01" dur="7.05">really been happening and this is the</text>
  <text start="954.18" dur="8.28">next phase we&amp;#39;re already heading in this</text>
  <text start="957.06" dur="7.26">direction we see the petrol you won it</text>
  <text start="962.46" dur="4.62">is surging right now because of all the</text>
  <text start="964.32" dur="5.04">sanctions on Iran and a lot of countries</text>
