  <text start="109.759" dur="5.191">here in the United States that</text>
  <text start="111.679" dur="6.481">confidence has dipped because people are</text>
  <text start="114.95" dur="6.63">too are beginning to question the long</text>
  <text start="118.16" dur="5.819">drawn-out expansion and the people are</text>
  <text start="121.58" dur="4.2">saying something just doesn&amp;#39;t feel right</text>
  <text start="123.979" dur="3.81">now the CBO they came out with their</text>
  <text start="125.78" dur="3.5">forecasts and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="127.789" dur="4.081">there&amp;#39;s gonna be another ten years of</text>

  <text start="134.269" dur="3.271">upbeat saying yeah we&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="135.89" dur="3.51">another ten years there won&amp;#39;t be any</text>
  <text start="137.54" dur="3.9">type of recession we&amp;#39;re just gonna keep</text>
  <text start="139.4" dur="4.14">adding to the debt everything&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="141.44" dur="4.26">be fine now you know when they come out</text>
  <text start="143.54" dur="4.32">with these reports you either it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="145.7" dur="4.2">government or the central bank it is</text>
  <text start="147.86" dur="5.28">always the opposite of what is really</text>
  <text start="149.9" dur="4.68">happening now we need to look at what</text>
  <text start="153.14" dur="4.709">has been happening here because we know</text>
  <text start="154.58" dur="6.03">there is a race to see who is going to</text>
  <text start="157.849" dur="4.831">control the narrative of the entire</text>
  <text start="160.61" dur="4.68">economic system when it completely</text>
  <text start="162.68" dur="4.35">breaks down we discussed the narrative</text>
  <text start="165.29" dur="4.32">and how the central bankers have a</text>
  <text start="167.03" dur="4.62">narrative back in the 70s where they</text>
  <text start="169.61" dur="4.409">blamed it on gold speculators there was</text>
  <text start="171.65" dur="4.29">no oil this is why we need to come off</text>
  <text start="174.019" dur="3.841">the gold standard they control the</text>
  <text start="175.94" dur="4.2">narrative back then they told you a</text>
  <text start="177.86" dur="4.5">story they made it up and they made</text>
  <text start="180.14" dur="3.37">everyone believe it and why this is all</text>
  <text start="182.36" dur="3.159">happening</text>
  <text start="183.51" dur="3.78">background which came out much much</text>
  <text start="185.519" dur="3.72">later we were moving on to the</text>
  <text start="187.29" dur="3.479">petrodollar system that has been in the</text>
  <text start="189.239" dur="3.481">works for a very long time</text>
  <text start="190.769" dur="4.17">they wore no gold speculators countries</text>
  <text start="192.72" dur="4.409">wanted their gold back because they</text>
  <text start="194.939" dur="3.63">realized that the United States broke</text>
  <text start="197.129" dur="3.39">their promise and they were creating a</text>
  <text start="198.569" dur="4.53">lot more currency than there was gold</text>
  <text start="200.519" dur="4.291">and this was the real problem and there</text>
  <text start="203.099" dur="4.14">was no shortage of oil there was plenty</text>
  <text start="204.81" dur="3.959">of oil but this was the transition</text>
  <text start="207.239" dur="5.161">period so they had to blame it on</text>
  <text start="208.769" dur="6.901">something so this brings us back to the</text>
  <text start="212.4" dur="5.28">narrative whoever controls the entire</text>
  <text start="215.67" dur="4.92">situation and whoever controls the</text>
  <text start="217.68" dur="6.209">economy comes coming down they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="220.59" dur="6.209">control the narrative now we know since</text>
  <text start="223.889" dur="4.831">the financial crisis the Fed has kept</text>
  <text start="226.799" dur="5.791">the cost of borrowing money for banks at</text>
  <text start="228.72" dur="6.06">near 0% interest that allow all these</text>
  <text start="232.59" dur="5.039">banks to borrow money to buy their own</text>
  <text start="234.78" dur="4.709">stock and many corporations did the same</text>
  <text start="237.629" dur="4.411">things you&amp;#39;ve you&amp;#39;ve heard of a lot of</text>
  <text start="239.489" dur="4.89">buybacks they did this to inflate their</text>
  <text start="242.04" dur="4.669">value but not of course the value of</text>
  <text start="244.379" dur="4.89">their services to the everyday person</text>
  <text start="246.709" dur="4.87">when money is cheap because interest</text>
  <text start="249.269" dur="3.991">rates are low or near zero the</text>
  <text start="251.579" dur="3.78">beneficiaries are those with the most</text>
  <text start="253.26" dur="3.99">direct access to it that means of course</text>
  <text start="255.359" dur="5.461">that the biggest banks members of the</text>
  <text start="257.25" dur="6.03">fed since its inception get the largest</text>
  <text start="260.82" dur="5.04">chunk of fabricated money and pay the</text>
  <text start="263.28" dur="5.16">least amount of interest for the lower</text>
  <text start="265.86" dur="5.67">look cost of money the easier it is for</text>
  <text start="268.44" dur="5.46">major companies to borrow it easy money</text>
  <text start="271.53" dur="5.13">means easy speculation for Wall Street</text>
  <text start="273.9" dur="5.04">and its main corporate clients which</text>
  <text start="276.66" dur="4.08">sooner or later will be a threat to the</text>
  <text start="278.94" dur="3.06">rest of us and we can see this in the</text>
  <text start="280.74" dur="3.899">stock market we can see what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="282" dur="4.889">going on since 2009 the Dow Jones</text>
  <text start="284.639" dur="6.991">Industrial Average well that increased</text>
  <text start="286.889" dur="8.34">by 24% and we know this started in 2008</text>
  <text start="291.63" dur="6.36">where they turn up the manipulation we</text>
  <text start="295.229" dur="4.651">know the Fed has a trading desk we know</text>
  <text start="297.99" dur="4.859">that other central banks have been</text>
  <text start="299.88" dur="5.7">buying the Fang stocks we know the Fed</text>
  <text start="302.849" dur="7.38">has been creating currency like crazy</text>
  <text start="305.58" dur="6.03">with qe1 qe2 qe3 QE to infinity we know</text>
  <text start="310.229" dur="2.881">they&amp;#39;ve been transferring the funds to</text>
  <text start="311.61" dur="4.21">other central banks where they took on</text>
  <text start="313.11" dur="5.32">the responsibility of pushing cue</text>
  <text start="315.82" dur="5.22">and all this has been been done since</text>
  <text start="318.43" dur="4.14">2008 and we know that most of these</text>
  <text start="321.04" dur="5.76">statistical numbers have been completely</text>
  <text start="322.57" dur="6.3">manipulated now under Obama&amp;#39;s reign this</text>
  <text start="326.8" dur="4.44">was fantastic for everyone the corporate</text>
  <text start="328.87" dur="5.01">media said this is great let them go let</text>
  <text start="331.24" dur="5.37">them do this and since Trump took office</text>
  <text start="333.88" dur="5.01">what has he really changed nothing</text>
  <text start="336.61" dur="5.82">actually he has pushed everything to the</text>
  <text start="338.89" dur="5.58">extreme so he&amp;#39;s using what the Fed what</text>
  <text start="342.43" dur="4.55">Obama the deep state what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="344.47" dur="6.06">doing before and turned it up a notch</text>
  <text start="346.98" dur="7.21">now why would he do this well think</text>
  <text start="350.53" dur="6.18">about it if you&amp;#39;re in a car and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="354.19" dur="6.33">revving the engine and you go to the</text>
  <text start="356.71" dur="7.38">redline what happens it blows this is</text>
  <text start="360.52" dur="7.35">what he&amp;#39;s trying to do now if we look at</text>
  <text start="364.09" dur="8.39">what is happening here in 2018 we&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="367.87" dur="8.1">quarter way into 2018 and it shadows</text>
  <text start="372.48" dur="6.16">2008 and we can see that there are</text>
  <text start="375.97" dur="5.79">things that are already emerging only</text>
  <text start="378.64" dur="5.76">two months ago the Dow log its worst</text>
  <text start="381.76" dur="5.64">single day point decline in history</text>
  <text start="384.4" dur="5.07">before bouncing back so what has been</text>
  <text start="387.4" dur="4.47">happening in the meantime well the</text>
  <text start="389.47" dur="5.73">countries whose banks caused the latest</text>
  <text start="391.87" dur="6.42">Krait the last crisis well they have</text>
  <text start="395.2" dur="6.39">added more debt they have gotten bigger</text>
  <text start="398.29" dur="5.16">and the whole entire system is worse off</text>
  <text start="401.59" dur="4.53">even though they&amp;#39;re making it look like</text>
  <text start="403.45" dur="5.4">it isn&amp;#39;t the unemployment rate is</text>
  <text start="406.12" dur="4.92">significantly lower than it was at the</text>
  <text start="408.85" dur="4.53">height of the financial crisis but for</text>
  <text start="411.04" dur="6.15">Main Street growth hasn&amp;#39;t been quite so</text>

  <text start="419.74" dur="6.12">poverty line median household income is</text>
  <text start="422.62" dur="6.99">only up by 5.3 percent since 2008 and</text>
  <text start="425.86" dur="7.05">remains well below where it was in 1998</text>
  <text start="429.61" dur="6.42">if you adjust for inflation WorkFirst</text>
  <text start="432.91" dur="5.72">workforce participation remains nearly</text>
  <text start="436.03" dur="6.74">as low as it&amp;#39;s ever been</text>
  <text start="438.63" dur="6.97">meanwhile the top 1% of American earners</text>
  <text start="442.77" dur="4">saw their incomes go up by leaps and</text>
  <text start="445.6" dur="2.92">bounds since the Fed started</text>

  <text start="448.52" dur="6.54">than 40 times that of the bottom 90%</text>
  <text start="451.479" dur="6.241">just as before 2007 2008 financial</text>
  <text start="455.06" dur="7.009">crisis there&amp;#39;s a scary level of</text>
  <text start="457.72" dur="7.84">confidence among politicians regulators</text>
  <text start="462.069" dur="5.891">the corporate media and the banking</text>
  <text start="465.56" dur="4.65">sector and they believe everything is</text>
  <text start="467.96" dur="4.769">fantastic even the new Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="470.21" dur="6.59">chair views the possible need for</text>
  <text start="472.729" dur="6.711">bailouts as a relic of bygone times as</text>
  <text start="476.8" dur="4.929">he said at his confirmation hearing</text>
  <text start="479.44" dur="4.599">generally speaking I think the financial</text>
  <text start="481.729" dur="4.111">system is quite strong when asked if</text>
  <text start="484.039" dur="4.47">there are any US banks that are still</text>
  <text start="485.84" dur="5.49">too big to fail he responded I would say</text>
  <text start="488.509" dur="6">no to that now when we look at the</text>
  <text start="491.33" dur="7.35">situation we know that the banks have</text>
  <text start="494.509" dur="6.96">gotten larger we know that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="498.68" dur="4.95">insolvent we know these stress tests are</text>
  <text start="501.469" dur="4.711">completely fake phony and false the</text>
  <text start="503.63" dur="4.89">risks posed by the largest of the</text>
  <text start="506.18" dur="4.5">private banks still exists only now</text>
  <text start="508.52" dur="6.209">they&amp;#39;re even bigger than they were back</text>
  <text start="510.68" dur="5.25">in 2007-2008 and there&amp;#39;s a lot more debt</text>
  <text start="514.729" dur="4.56">there&amp;#39;s a lot more corporate debt</text>
  <text start="515.93" dur="7.19">there&amp;#39;s a lot more public debt global</text>
  <text start="519.289" dur="6.121">debt and nothing has been repaired</text>
  <text start="523.12" dur="4.12">actually they just placed a big bandaid</text>
  <text start="525.41" dur="4.53">on it and hope for the best they created</text>
  <text start="527.24" dur="5.37">this illusion that we&amp;#39;re in today now</text>
  <text start="529.94" dur="4.5">the next time the crisis hits we know</text>
  <text start="532.61" dur="2.94">that liquidity is gonna die banks are</text>
  <text start="534.44" dur="3.649">gonna close their doors to the public</text>
  <text start="535.55" dur="4.95">and all those people in Wall Street</text>
  <text start="538.089" dur="5.56">corporations they&amp;#39;re all gonna crawl</text>
  <text start="540.5" dur="5.19">back to the government except this time</text>
  <text start="543.649" dur="4.291">it&amp;#39;s a little different Trump is in</text>
  <text start="545.69" dur="4.23">office we know that Andrew Jackson is</text>
  <text start="547.94" dur="3.209">hanging on his wall which means that</text>
  <text start="549.92" dur="6.33">he&amp;#39;s going to be going after the central</text>
  <text start="551.149" dur="8.281">bank so Trump at this point has</text>
  <text start="556.25" dur="7.02">appointed members to the Fed who will</text>
  <text start="559.43" dur="8.04">only increase the danger of those risks</text>
  <text start="563.27" dur="5.819">that he saw in 2008 so basically he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="567.47" dur="3.869">using everything that Obama did</text>
  <text start="569.089" dur="6.091">everything the Fed put into place he</text>
  <text start="571.339" dur="7.231">appointed members to the Fed board to</text>
  <text start="575.18" dur="6.33">continually push the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="578.57" dur="3.83">that was happening before and making</text>
  <text start="581.51" dur="4.64">this go too</text>
  <text start="582.4" dur="7.38">red line he&amp;#39;s pushing the Fed to crash</text>
  <text start="586.15" dur="6.74">the economy everything that is happening</text>
  <text start="589.78" dur="6.72">right now is to push it to the edge and</text>
  <text start="592.89" dur="6.79">when all these individuals come to</text>
  <text start="596.5" dur="4.82">government the government at that time</text>
  <text start="599.68" dur="4.62">is going to have to make a decision</text>
  <text start="601.32" dur="5.31">because we were doing everything the Fed</text>
  <text start="604.3" dur="4.77">said we were using all your policies</text>
  <text start="606.63" dur="4.36">this is what you&amp;#39;ve been telling us to</text>
  <text start="609.07" dur="3.8">do you&amp;#39;re telling us the economy strong</text>
  <text start="610.99" dur="5.76">I mean think about the argument here and</text>

  <text start="621.88" dur="5.19">do all of this what went wrong now the</text>
  <text start="624.85" dur="3.66">Fed is gonna have to explain this and</text>
  <text start="627.07" dur="3.75">there&amp;#39;s going to be an investigation</text>
  <text start="628.51" dur="4.14">Congress is gonna scratch their head and</text>
