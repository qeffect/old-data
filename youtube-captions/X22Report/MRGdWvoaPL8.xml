  <text start="178.68" dur="5.21">I believe what was happening here</text>
  <text start="180.9" dur="6.02">because we need to go back to 2016 2017</text>
  <text start="183.89" dur="6.28">Trump started the voter fraud</text>
  <text start="186.92" dur="6.19">investigation and then kind of stopped</text>
  <text start="190.17" dur="4.95">it because a lot of cities counties a</text>
  <text start="193.11" dur="5.07">lot of the polling areas would not</text>
  <text start="195.12" dur="6">cooperate and I believe this was a sting</text>
  <text start="198.18" dur="4.86">operation at the time where Hugh was</text>
  <text start="201.12" dur="7.26">telling us they heard internal comms and</text>
  <text start="203.04" dur="9.169">what better way to show voter fraud than</text>
  <text start="208.38" dur="8.37">to catch certain individuals in the act</text>
  <text start="212.209" dur="8.381">gather the evidence take pictures show</text>
  <text start="216.75" dur="8.26">what they&amp;#39;re doing and I believe that is</text>
  <text start="220.59" dur="7.78">what is happening right now now</text>
  <text start="225.01" dur="6.809">in Florida in Arizona many different</text>
  <text start="228.37" dur="7.31">states Texas also we&amp;#39;re seeing something</text>
  <text start="231.819" dur="8.271">very interesting happening we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="235.68" dur="8.889">recounts or we&amp;#39;re seeing ballots up here</text>
  <text start="240.09" dur="7.81">from dead voters from ballot from people</text>
  <text start="244.569" dur="5.671">that didn&amp;#39;t even don&amp;#39;t even exist and we</text>
  <text start="247.9" dur="5.04">also see</text>
  <text start="250.24" dur="6.66">ballots being destroyed at the same time</text>
  <text start="252.94" dur="5.46">so in Florida a Florida official who was</text>
  <text start="256.9" dur="3.839">put in charge of counting votes in</text>
  <text start="258.4" dur="4.02">Broward County for the gubernatorial and</text>
  <text start="260.739" dur="4.531">Senate race previously destroyed voter</text>
  <text start="262.42" dur="4.68">ballots a judge ruled and was most</text>
  <text start="265.27" dur="5.7">recently accused of not removing dead</text>
  <text start="267.1" dur="5.55">voters from the voter rolls now this is</text>
  <text start="270.97" dur="4.02">Broward County Board of Elections</text>
  <text start="272.65" dur="5.13">supervisor Brenda Snipes she is in</text>
  <text start="274.99" dur="5.67">charge of vote counting in the area and</text>
  <text start="277.78" dur="4.68">has yet to disclose how many ballots are</text>
  <text start="280.66" dur="3.6">still not count - despite the election</text>
  <text start="282.46" dur="4.77">for governor and Senate occurring two</text>
  <text start="284.26" dur="5.67">days ago now if we go back to May a</text>
  <text start="287.23" dur="4.59">judge ruled that Snipes had violated</text>
  <text start="289.93" dur="5.13">state and federal law after she</text>
  <text start="291.82" dur="7.08">destroyed voter ballots in the 2016</text>
  <text start="295.06" dur="6.21">state congressional election now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="298.9" dur="6.06">just amazing and this was the race for</text>
  <text start="301.27" dur="5.82">former DNC chairwoman representative</text>
  <text start="304.96" dur="4.44">Debbie wasserman-schultz she won</text>
  <text start="307.09" dur="5.81">re-election by less than seven thousand</text>
  <text start="309.4" dur="6.09">votes that&amp;#39;s interesting the next year</text>
  <text start="312.9" dur="5.2">when Canova asked to review the paper</text>
  <text start="315.49" dur="4.95">ballots in the race it was revealed that</text>
  <text start="318.1" dur="4.89">Snipes destroyed the ballots only 12</text>
  <text start="320.44" dur="4.44">months after the primary federal and</text>
  <text start="322.99" dur="4.14">state law mandates the ballots not be</text>
  <text start="324.88" dur="3.839">destroyed until 22 months after an</text>
  <text start="327.13" dur="4.649">election</text>
  <text start="328.719" dur="6.93">so the case exposed that Snipes staff</text>
  <text start="331.779" dur="7.29">had open ballots in a in private in 2016</text>
  <text start="335.649" dur="5.1">on election day now just last year this</text>
  <text start="339.069" dur="3.71">knifes office was taken to federal court</text>
  <text start="340.749" dur="4.35">by the American Civil Rights Union</text>
  <text start="342.779" dur="4.36">represented by the public interest Legal</text>
  <text start="345.099" dur="5.19">Foundation after being accused of</text>
  <text start="347.139" dur="5.4">keeping felons non-citizens and dead</text>
  <text start="350.289" dur="5.22">voters on the voter rolls in Broward</text>
  <text start="352.539" dur="6.09">County and at one point allegedly having</text>
  <text start="355.509" dur="6.39">more voters on the rolls than actually</text>
  <text start="358.629" dur="4.95">voters in the county so this is very</text>
  <text start="361.899" dur="5.85">very interesting that my biggest</text>
  <text start="363.579" dur="7.2">question is how is she still the person</text>
  <text start="367.749" dur="5.48">who&amp;#39;s in charge of all of this with all</text>
  <text start="370.779" dur="6.93">this coming out this makes no sense</text>
  <text start="373.229" dur="7.78">whatsoever so Trump was out there today</text>
  <text start="377.709" dur="5.79">and he was tweeting like crazy so here a</text>
  <text start="381.009" dur="6.84">couple of his tweets and this is on</text>

  <text start="451.809" dur="3.901">and probably getting ready to do a</text>
  <text start="453.46" dur="3.87">number couldn&amp;#39;t do it because not enough</text>
  <text start="455.71" dur="4.53">people live in Broward for them to</text>

  <text start="460.24" dur="7.56">tweet just out in Arizona signatures</text>
  <text start="464.139" dur="5.911">don&amp;#39;t match electoral corruption call</text>
  <text start="467.8" dur="5.579">for new election we must protect our</text>
  <text start="470.05" dur="5.639">democracy now remember what Q said they</text>
  <text start="473.379" dur="5.01">already knew they were internal comms</text>
  <text start="475.689" dur="6.9">they already knew that this was going to</text>
  <text start="478.389" dur="5.25">go down now in Texas nine people have</text>
  <text start="482.589" dur="2.97">been arrested in connection and</text>
  <text start="483.639" dur="5.28">participating in illegal voting scheme</text>
  <text start="485.559" dur="5.371">in Edinburg Texas the arrests following</text>
  <text start="488.919" dur="3.571">an ongoing investigation where political</text>

  <text start="496.449" dur="6.421">city of Edinburgh municipal races so</text>
  <text start="499.99" dur="6.529">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the swamp</text>
  <text start="502.87" dur="8.37">is doing what they do best they are</text>
  <text start="506.519" dur="7.841">pushing their agenda and I believe from</text>
  <text start="511.24" dur="5.489">what Hugh has been telling us this was a</text>
  <text start="514.36" dur="4.65">setup they wanted them to do this</text>
  <text start="516.729" dur="4.68">because how do you investigate something</text>
  <text start="519.01" dur="3.87">where county&amp;#39;s polling areas states</text>
  <text start="521.409" dur="3.12">where they&amp;#39;re not cooperating with you</text>
  <text start="522.88" dur="3.54">if they&amp;#39;re not cooperating and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="524.529" dur="3.841">throwing away the evidence or getting</text>
  <text start="526.42" dur="5.58">rid of the evidence how do you have an</text>
  <text start="528.37" dur="5.25">investigation it&amp;#39;s kind of hard so if</text>
  <text start="532" dur="3.779">you allow the enemy to destroy</text>
  <text start="533.62" dur="5.76">themselves like Q has said many times</text>
  <text start="535.779" dur="4.691">before you allow them to push voter</text>
  <text start="539.38" dur="4.51">fraud</text>
  <text start="540.47" dur="8.61">while they&amp;#39;re doing this you monitored</text>
  <text start="543.89" dur="8.87">them you collect evidence you have the</text>
  <text start="549.08" dur="7.76">proof that&amp;#39;s what you do</text>
  <text start="552.76" dur="4.08">forced exposure</text>
  <text start="557.03" dur="5.31">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="559.36" dur="5.44">Trump did sign the proclamation for</text>
  <text start="562.34" dur="4.65">blocking asylum seekers caught at the</text>
  <text start="564.8" dur="5.55">us-mexico border and we talked about</text>
  <text start="566.99" dur="6.48">this before and he signed this and now</text>
  <text start="570.35" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s going to force and funnel the</text>
  <text start="573.47" dur="3.03">asylum seekers toward the ports of entry</text>
  <text start="575.3" dur="4.32">where they&amp;#39;re supposed to go in the</text>
  <text start="576.5" dur="5.52">first place so the ban will last 90 days</text>
  <text start="579.62" dur="6.24">or until the u.s. strikes a safe third</text>
  <text start="582.02" dur="5.76">country a sound deal with Mexico during</text>
  <text start="585.86" dur="3.87">that time US officials will be ordered</text>
  <text start="587.78" dur="4.29">to consult with the government of Mexico</text>
  <text start="589.73" dur="4.26">to address the issue of large groups of</text>
  <text start="592.07" dur="5.4">aliens traveling through Mexico and</text>
  <text start="593.99" dur="6.27">route to the US so this is in place</text>
  <text start="597.47" dur="7.29">right now now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="600.26" dur="7.11">that Michelle Obama went off on a rant</text>
  <text start="604.76" dur="7.74">about her husband and that is Barack</text>
  <text start="607.37" dur="7.08">Obama now in her forthcoming memoir she</text>
  <text start="612.5" dur="4.62">described Trump&amp;#39;s birther falsehoods as</text>
  <text start="614.45" dur="4.86">crazy and mean-spirited and motivated by</text>
  <text start="617.12" dur="4.38">racist bigotry and she accused him of</text>
  <text start="619.31" dur="4.56">deliberately stoking those conspiracy</text>
  <text start="621.5" dur="2.93">theories to stir up the wingnuts and The</text>
  <text start="623.87" dur="2.93">Kooks</text>
  <text start="624.43" dur="4.57">what if someone with an unstable mind</text>
  <text start="626.8" dur="4.75">loaded a gun and drove to Washington</text>
  <text start="629" dur="5.82">Michelle Obama wrote what if that person</text>
  <text start="631.55" dur="5.58">went looking for our girls Donald Trump</text>

  <text start="637.13" dur="4.35">putting my family&amp;#39;s safety at risk and</text>
  <text start="638.839" dur="6.211">for this I&amp;#39;d never forgive him well</text>
  <text start="641.48" dur="7.76">Trump was asked about this and he said</text>
  <text start="645.05" dur="4.19">the following listen to what he said</text>
  <text start="653.889" dur="3.901">Oh Michelle Obama said that I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="656.319" dur="3.06">seen it I guess you wrote a books you</text>
  <text start="657.79" dur="3.779">got paid a lot of money to write up up</text>
  <text start="659.379" dur="4.02">and they always insist that you come up</text>
  <text start="661.569" dur="3.601">with controversial well I&amp;#39;ll give you a</text>
  <text start="663.399" dur="4.44">little controversy back I&amp;#39;ll never</text>
  <text start="665.17" dur="5.699">forgive him for what he did to our</text>
  <text start="667.839" dur="5.97">United States military by not funding it</text>
  <text start="670.869" dur="5.76">properly it was depleted everything was</text>
  <text start="673.809" dur="4.95">old and tired and I came in and I had to</text>
  <text start="676.629" dur="4.62">fix it and I&amp;#39;m in the process of</text>

  <text start="946.63" dur="5.58">reversed well it looks like this was</text>
  <text start="949.69" dur="6.36">done on purpose so Ron Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="952.21" dur="6.18">wouldn&amp;#39;t move into his position sessions</text>
  <text start="956.05" dur="6.63">resigned so Trump would have the ability</text>
  <text start="958.39" dur="8.82">to choose who he wanted so when we look</text>
  <text start="962.68" dur="8.4">at this we can see this most likely was</text>
  <text start="967.21" dur="6.24">the plan now sessions he didn&amp;#39;t resist</text>
  <text start="971.08" dur="3.66">Trump&amp;#39;s resignation request this is how</text>
  <text start="973.45" dur="3.75">we know that it&amp;#39;s pretty much part of</text>

  <text start="977.2" dur="6.3">wouldn&amp;#39;t matter of sessions had done so</text>
  <text start="979.21" dur="7.1">anyhow because on March 31st 2017 there</text>
  <text start="983.5" dur="7.46">was an executive order that was created</text>

  <text start="1044.53" dur="9.55">2017 this was the plan all along so the</text>

  <text start="1057.23" dur="3.93">Attorney General within the boundaries</text>
  <text start="1058.61" dur="5.88">of the vacancy Act well then we have to</text>
  <text start="1061.16" dur="8.04">look at the vacancy Act v u.s. code at</text>
  <text start="1064.49" dur="7.83">section 33 4:6 it says except in the</text>
  <text start="1069.2" dur="5.52">case of a vacancy caused by sickness the</text>

  <text start="1086" dur="5.88">subject to the subsection B once a first</text>
  <text start="1090.26" dur="3.39">or second nomination for the office is</text>
  <text start="1091.88" dur="3.84">submitted to the Senate for the date of</text>

  <text start="1095.72" dur="7.11">nomination is pending in the Senate</text>
  <text start="1098.42" dur="5.73">Section B 1 if the first nomination for</text>
  <text start="1102.83" dur="3.27">the office is rejected by the Senate</text>

  <text start="1111.23" dur="5.7">than 210 days</text>
  <text start="1113.51" dur="6.81">so basically Trump can have this acting</text>
  <text start="1116.93" dur="6.45">Attorney General in there for 210 days</text>
  <text start="1120.32" dur="7.2">according to his executive order and</text>

  <text start="1207.05" dur="7.8">know is that this was a sting operation</text>
  <text start="1209.24" dur="8.6">and Q and the Trump administration there</text>
  <text start="1214.85" dur="6.33">are allowing them to destroy themselves</text>

  <text start="1222.89" dur="4.77">destroying themselves and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1225.56" dur="5.13">interesting is that the corporate media</text>
  <text start="1227.66" dur="5.97">asked Trump a lot of things don&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="1230.69" dur="6.33">think it&amp;#39;s odd that they&amp;#39;ve never asked</text>
  <text start="1233.63" dur="5.55">do you know who Q is they never asked</text>
  <text start="1237.02" dur="4.92">the question I mean they put out</text>
  <text start="1239.18" dur="6.6">articles they try to you know make it</text>
  <text start="1241.94" dur="6.39">seem like Q&amp;#39;s a conspiracy theory that Q</text>
  <text start="1245.78" dur="4.11">is not connected to Trump at all but</text>
  <text start="1248.33" dur="3.75">they never just came out and just asked</text>
  <text start="1249.89" dur="5.31">a simple question why didn&amp;#39;t they do</text>
  <text start="1252.08" dur="5.46">that it&amp;#39;s very odd and it&amp;#39;s been proven</text>
  <text start="1255.2" dur="4.68">many many times that Q and Trump are</text>
  <text start="1257.54" dur="4.59">working together I mean think about it</text>
  <text start="1259.88" dur="3.71">it can&amp;#39;t be a coincidence anymore</text>
  <text start="1262.13" dur="4.71">because it&amp;#39;s mathematically impossible</text>
  <text start="1263.59" dur="4.96">so the press they&amp;#39;re most likely they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1266.84" dur="5.99">never gonna ask that question because if</text>
  <text start="1268.55" dur="7.38">Trump answers yes I know who Q is</text>
  <text start="1272.83" dur="6.67">everything falls apart for them it&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1275.93" dur="5.91">longer a conspiracy and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1279.5" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re not gonna ask maybe someone will</text>
  <text start="1281.84" dur="7.37">ask eventually but at this point I think</text>
  <text start="1285.26" dur="3.95">they&amp;#39;ve been told not to do it</text>
  <text start="1289.38" dur="6.539">now in Afghanistan we see that the</text>
