  <text start="56.62" dur="6.9">years we know the Rockefeller Foundation</text>
  <text start="59.159" dur="5.921">holds the patent and we know that the</text>
  <text start="63.52" dur="5.82">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="65.08" dur="6.69">they&amp;#39;re pushing an agenda now many</text>
  <text start="69.34" dur="5.16">believe there is a new sign up about to</text>
  <text start="71.77" dur="5.94">happen maybe later this summer into the</text>

  <text start="77.71" dur="4.95">the pre propaganda to build this up now</text>
  <text start="81.52" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;re getting another indicator that</text>
  <text start="82.66" dur="5.43">this might be the case because we can</text>

  <text start="90.7" dur="7.44">clinical trials on the Zika virus</text>
  <text start="94.24" dur="5.609">vaccine and this was developed earlier</text>
  <text start="98.14" dur="5.61">this year by the National Institutes of</text>

  <text start="103.75" dur="4.89">have finished their testing on animals</text>
  <text start="105.869" dur="6.271">which has been very encouraging they say</text>
  <text start="108.64" dur="6.81">and they&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;re pleased</text>
  <text start="112.14" dur="5.679">with everything they&amp;#39;ve done and they</text>
  <text start="115.45" dur="5.52">can proceed with the initial study in</text>

  <text start="137.379" dur="9.72">prepping the people to receive the</text>
  <text start="140.379" dur="11.161">vaccine and we can see already that this</text>
  <text start="147.099" dur="6.72">is a new sign up I mean if this becomes</text>
  <text start="151.54" dur="3.57">huge through the corporate media now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="153.819" dur="3.301">not saying that Zika is going to be all</text>
  <text start="155.11" dur="4.709">over the place but they can make it seem</text>
  <text start="157.12" dur="4.77">like it&amp;#39;s a lot worse than it really is</text>
  <text start="159.819" dur="3.691">now they&amp;#39;ve only found 14 cases how many</text>
  <text start="161.89" dur="2.9">people are there in the United States or</text>
  <text start="163.51" dur="3.75">just in Florida</text>
  <text start="164.79" dur="5.68">but with the corporate media they can</text>
  <text start="167.26" dur="5.67">make people afraid scared you have to</text>
  <text start="170.47" dur="4.83">get this vaccine especially those people</text>
  <text start="172.93" dur="4.31">who want to have children and we know</text>
  <text start="175.3" dur="4.77">that this has nothing to do with that</text>
  <text start="177.24" dur="7.84">this is about the pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="180.07" dur="9">industry vaccines and maybe declaring a</text>
  <text start="185.08" dur="6.06">state of emergency and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="189.07" dur="6.86">have to watch this situation very</text>
  <text start="191.14" dur="7.29">carefully we see that North Korea</text>
  <text start="195.93" dur="5.29">allegedly fired a ballistic missile into</text>
  <text start="198.43" dur="8.31">the sea today South Korea has been</text>
  <text start="201.22" dur="10.05">reporting this so has Japan and Japan is</text>
  <text start="206.74" dur="8.94">saying that the firing of this ballistic</text>
  <text start="211.27" dur="9.45">missile plunged into japan&amp;#39;s exclusive</text>
  <text start="215.68" dur="7.08">economic zone and following this missile</text>
  <text start="220.72" dur="4.56">launch japan&amp;#39;s government submitted a</text>
  <text start="222.76" dur="6.75">protest to the north korean through its</text>
  <text start="225.28" dur="6.09">diplomatic ties in beijing and we can</text>
  <text start="229.51" dur="3.78">see already South Korea and the u.s. and</text>
  <text start="231.37" dur="3.99">Japan are saying okay we mean we need</text>
  <text start="233.29" dur="4.95">more defensive weapons we need to</text>
  <text start="235.36" dur="6.81">increase our military budgets and this</text>
  <text start="238.24" dur="6.24">is what it&amp;#39;s all about preparing for</text>
  <text start="242.17" dur="4.85">this upcoming war this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="244.48" dur="6.48">been moving military assets and troops</text>
  <text start="247.02" dur="5.86">increasing military budgets for the last</text>
  <text start="250.96" dur="3.63">couple of years and we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="252.88" dur="5.16">and tracking this and we can see that</text>
  <text start="254.59" dur="6.09">there&amp;#39;s been a huge buildup in Eastern</text>
  <text start="258.04" dur="6.42">Europe the Middle East and the Pacific</text>
  <text start="260.68" dur="10.83">and this is in preparation for what is</text>
  <text start="264.46" dur="9.48">coming now the UN they are warning about</text>
  <text start="271.51" dur="5.96">the escalating tension in eastern</text>
  <text start="273.94" dur="7.77">Ukraine you&amp;#39;re saying it hit its highest</text>
  <text start="277.47" dur="6.34">casualties since last August and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="281.71" dur="3.72">very worried about this because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="283.81" dur="4.53">looking at the situation at the contact</text>
  <text start="285.43" dur="5.37">line there is more shelling it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="288.34" dur="6.05">heating up and it&amp;#39;s funny how the</text>
  <text start="290.8" dur="5.97">corporate media not even touching this</text>
  <text start="294.39" dur="4.179">they don&amp;#39;t even want you to know what is</text>
  <text start="296.77" dur="4.349">going on in Ukraine because</text>
  <text start="298.569" dur="5.791">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="301.119" dur="7.38">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="304.36" dur="8.029">they&amp;#39;re bombing in Libya bombing in</text>
  <text start="308.499" dur="7.47">Yemen getting prepared to go into Sudan</text>
  <text start="312.389" dur="7.631">there in Iraq bombing and in Syria and</text>
  <text start="315.969" dur="8.581">now we have Ukraine it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="320.02" dur="8.129">feel like a world war because the u.s.</text>
  <text start="324.55" dur="6">is fighting all over the place and let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="328.149" dur="6.181">not forget about the Pacific with the US</text>
  <text start="330.55" dur="8.989">provoking China and North Korea all at</text>
  <text start="334.33" dur="8.569">the same time now do they care about</text>
  <text start="339.539" dur="6.1">getting into a war with China Russia</text>
  <text start="342.899" dur="4.47">North Korea especially those nations</text>
  <text start="345.639" dur="5.34">that have nuclear weapons no they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="347.369" dur="5.98">this is why the Obama administration has</text>
  <text start="350.979" dur="7.381">given the go-ahead for work on upgrading</text>
  <text start="353.349" dur="8.79">the b61 airborne nuclear bomb they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="358.36" dur="7.079">upgrading the nuclear arsenal now the</text>
  <text start="362.139" dur="6.12">decision by the NSA authorized the</text>
  <text start="365.439" dur="4.95">program to enter a post engineering</text>
  <text start="368.259" dur="5.43">phase which comes after four years of</text>
  <text start="370.389" dur="6.27">work to in technical terms preserve a</text>
  <text start="373.689" dur="7.83">critical element of the US nuclear triad</text>
  <text start="376.659" dur="8.19">and the extended deterrent so we can see</text>
  <text start="381.519" dur="8.4">already that as a result of all this</text>
  <text start="384.849" dur="8.31">they&amp;#39;ll be upgrading the bombs now why</text>
  <text start="389.919" dur="5.28">are they doing this I thought Obama was</text>
  <text start="393.159" dur="4.74">out there telling the entire world that</text>
  <text start="395.199" dur="6.09">we should get rid of nuclear weapons but</text>
  <text start="397.899" dur="5.55">here we are upgrading very interesting</text>
  <text start="401.289" dur="7.62">what are they preparing for once again</text>
  <text start="403.449" dur="7.74">they&amp;#39;re preparing for war now a couple</text>
  <text start="408.909" dur="5.451">days ago we reported on a US military</text>
  <text start="411.189" dur="5.76">satellite that was launched it was a</text>
  <text start="414.36" dur="6.729">satellite that they really didn&amp;#39;t talk</text>
  <text start="416.949" dur="6.77">about but now we know it&amp;#39;s the m uo s5</text>
  <text start="421.089" dur="7.47">the mobile user objective system and</text>
  <text start="423.719" dur="6.641">this satellite was a communication</text>
  <text start="428.559" dur="3.301">satellite meant to provide ultra high</text>
  <text start="430.36" dur="2.27">frequency communications for the US</text>
  <text start="431.86" dur="3.809">military</text>
  <text start="432.63" dur="6.25">over areas in the Middle East Africa and</text>
  <text start="435.669" dur="5.641">Asia there was one problem with the</text>
  <text start="438.88" dur="6.06">satellite it failed to reach its</text>
  <text start="441.31" dur="7.829">intended orbit this week and it is not</text>
  <text start="444.94" dur="7.289">functional now this was the last of five</text>
  <text start="449.139" dur="5.041">satellites which are used by the mobile</text>
  <text start="452.229" dur="4.831">US troops as a high-speed global</text>
  <text start="454.18" dur="6.03">cellular network for secure voice data</text>
  <text start="457.06" dur="7.44">and video communications and the whole</text>
  <text start="460.21" dur="7.17">thing did not work out and right now is</text>
  <text start="464.5" dur="5.91">just not functional and this might be a</text>
  <text start="467.38" dur="6.57">problem for the upcoming missions</text>
  <text start="470.41" dur="5.21">throughout the region and this is</text>
  <text start="473.95" dur="3.63">something that we need to keep an eye on</text>
  <text start="475.62" dur="5.53">because we can see that things are</text>
  <text start="477.58" dur="6.089">heating up all across the Middle East at</text>
  <text start="481.15" dur="6.389">this point Eastern Europe and the</text>
  <text start="483.669" dur="8.97">Pacific now as we know Obama has</text>
  <text start="487.539" dur="8.25">authorized the bombing of Libya and the</text>
  <text start="492.639" dur="5.011">Italian defence minister is going to let</text>
  <text start="495.789" dur="3.541">the United States use its basis for</text>
  <text start="497.65" dur="3.87">strikes against the Islamic state but</text>
  <text start="499.33" dur="4.98">they want to make it clear that Italy</text>
  <text start="501.52" dur="5.1">has not been involved so far in any way</text>
  <text start="504.31" dur="5.55">in the u.s. strikes against the Islamic</text>
  <text start="506.62" dur="5.1">state that will come later and we know</text>
  <text start="509.86" dur="5.79">right now there are special op teams</text>
  <text start="511.72" dur="5.999">inside of Libya Frances their UK is</text>
  <text start="515.65" dur="6.259">there the United States is there so</text>
  <text start="517.719" dur="8.821">there are ground troops inside of Libya</text>
  <text start="521.909" dur="6.521">so Obama is out there and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="526.54" dur="6.84">that the libyan air strikes their</text>
  <text start="528.43" dur="8.58">critical to the US security now the</text>
  <text start="533.38" dur="6">airstrikes have continually going on</text>
  <text start="537.01" dur="3.96">it&amp;#39;s on its second day right now and of</text>
  <text start="539.38" dur="2.91">course they&amp;#39;re using the cover story</text>
  <text start="540.97" dur="5.04">that they&amp;#39;re going after the Islamic</text>
  <text start="542.29" dur="5.669">state and he said that the strikes are</text>
  <text start="546.01" dur="3.81">needed to ensure that Libya&amp;#39;s fragile</text>
  <text start="547.959" dur="7.32">new government you know the government</text>
  <text start="549.82" dur="7.769">that the people didn&amp;#39;t elect well we</text>
  <text start="555.279" dur="5.461">need to make sure that this new</text>
  <text start="557.589" dur="6.151">government of national Accord is able to</text>
  <text start="560.74" dur="5.31">finish the job of course as we know</text>
  <text start="563.74" dur="4.32">there&amp;#39;s two other governments in</text>
  <text start="566.05" dur="5.3">of Libya right now in different regions</text>
  <text start="568.06" dur="8.1">the people elected these governments and</text>
  <text start="571.35" dur="9.01">we can see that the u.s. they want</text>
  <text start="576.16" dur="8.9">control of the entire region so Obama</text>
  <text start="580.36" dur="9.93">has authorized 30 days of bombing in</text>
  <text start="585.06" dur="8.019">Libya so it started August first simply</text>
  <text start="590.29" dur="4.14">amazing Congress has been taking their</text>
  <text start="593.079" dur="5.25">break they don&amp;#39;t come back after Labor</text>
  <text start="594.43" dur="9.42">Day and here we have 30 days of bombing</text>
  <text start="598.329" dur="9.421">in Libya now i&amp;#39;m expecting other events</text>
  <text start="603.85" dur="6.66">to occur during this period as we can</text>
  <text start="607.75" dur="4.98">see it always seems to happen where the</text>
  <text start="610.51" dur="4.68">united states government central bankers</text>
  <text start="612.73" dur="6.9">do something during this period when</text>
  <text start="615.19" dur="6.99">congress goes on break we see that the</text>
  <text start="619.63" dur="6.84">Islamic state oil revenues they are down</text>
  <text start="622.18" dur="6.21">by ninety percent so right now the</text>
  <text start="626.47" dur="4.17">Islamic state pretty much they&amp;#39;re done</text>
  <text start="628.39" dur="5.88">for now of course the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="630.64" dur="5.91">still playing them up how they can hit</text>
  <text start="634.27" dur="5.16">us at any time because they need the</text>
  <text start="636.55" dur="5.039">fear factor who do they have left they</text>
  <text start="639.43" dur="5.21">need to use the Islamic state to</text>
  <text start="641.589" dur="6.411">convince us that they&amp;#39;re coming for us</text>
  <text start="644.64" dur="8.08">now Turkish politicians and activists</text>
  <text start="648" dur="9.37">they want Ankara to close the facilities</text>
  <text start="652.72" dur="9">of the Incirlik Air Base they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="657.37" dur="7.17">that NATO and Washington they were using</text>
  <text start="661.72" dur="4.65">this base to destabilize the Middle East</text>
  <text start="664.54" dur="4.56">well that&amp;#39;s exactly what they were using</text>
  <text start="666.37" dur="5.43">it for an earth-1 at the time was</text>
  <text start="669.1" dur="5.7">allowing this now chairman of the</text>
  <text start="671.8" dur="4.92">Freedom and solidary party they</text>
  <text start="674.8" dur="6.029">maintained that inter lick is a major</text>
  <text start="676.72" dur="6.69">stumbling block on Turkey&amp;#39;s way to</text>
  <text start="680.829" dur="4.411">independence since the United States has</text>
  <text start="683.41" dur="3.96">used it to carry out plans in the region</text>
  <text start="685.24" dur="5.37">the main goal of creating the base was</text>
  <text start="687.37" dur="7.05">to redraw the entire map of the Middle</text>
  <text start="690.61" dur="5.76">East he said Incirlik served as a</text>
  <text start="694.42" dur="4.92">command and control center of the coup</text>
  <text start="696.37" dur="8.76">and at this point</text>
  <text start="699.34" dur="10.97">we want the u.s. NATO forces out of this</text>
  <text start="705.13" dur="7.32">base so this is another indicator that</text>
  <text start="710.31" dur="6.4">they understand that the United States</text>
  <text start="712.45" dur="9.03">Glenn they were behind the coup and we</text>
  <text start="716.71" dur="8.7">can see that this is a major problem for</text>
  <text start="721.48" dur="6.75">the neocons the elites in their goal to</text>
  <text start="725.41" dur="5.04">remove Assad and at this point I think</text>
  <text start="728.23" dur="5.52">we should be a little worried about</text>
  <text start="730.45" dur="5.64">what&amp;#39;s going on in Syria now we can all</text>
  <text start="733.75" dur="4.2">say well everything will work out</text>
  <text start="736.09" dur="4.44">there&amp;#39;s a peace deal going on cease fire</text>
  <text start="737.95" dur="6.9">maybe the US doesn&amp;#39;t want Assad removed</text>
  <text start="740.53" dur="7.71">at this point well I think they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="744.85" dur="5.43">at this for so long they have blinders</text>
  <text start="748.24" dur="5.58">on and all they can see is Assad be</text>
  <text start="750.28" dur="7.26">removed unless there&amp;#39;s some way they can</text>
  <text start="753.82" dur="6.63">get Assad to keep that small Alawite</text>
  <text start="757.54" dur="6.9">section in Syria and the u.s. have the</text>
  <text start="760.45" dur="6.87">entire rest of the country so right now</text>
  <text start="764.44" dur="6.51">we understand that the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="767.32" dur="6.6">beaten in Syria the u.s. they&amp;#39;re backed</text>
  <text start="770.95" dur="5.01">against a wall and they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="773.92" dur="8.12">whatever they possibly can to convince</text>
  <text start="775.96" dur="9.66">the world that Assad Russian forces</text>
  <text start="782.04" dur="7.72">there make the they&amp;#39;re creating problems</text>

  <text start="855.07" dur="7.5">in the beginning it&amp;#39;s not going to get</text>
  <text start="857.949" dur="10.83">traction now people are realizing that</text>
  <text start="862.57" dur="8.28">this is complete propaganda so the</text>
  <text start="868.779" dur="6.841">Russians are out there they have</text>

  <text start="910.51" dur="6.09">building two bases along with the French</text>
  <text start="913.899" dur="7.531">the UK and the rest they have no idea</text>
  <text start="916.6" dur="7.38">what&amp;#39;s going on of course they do they</text>
  <text start="921.43" dur="4.909">know exactly what&amp;#39;s going on they know</text>
  <text start="923.98" dur="5.729">exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing at this point</text>
  <text start="926.339" dur="6.851">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is figure out</text>
  <text start="929.709" dur="6.091">a way where they can say this ceasefire</text>
  <text start="933.19" dur="6.209">peace deal is off look what Assad is</text>
  <text start="935.8" dur="6.93">doing Russia is involved in this you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="939.399" dur="6.42">using chemical weapons on the people you</text>
  <text start="942.73" dur="8.01">lied to us and all bets are off we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="945.819" dur="9.361">going after Assad and it seems we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="950.74" dur="6.81">heading down that path and we need to</text>
  <text start="955.18" dur="5.37">watch this situation very closely</text>
  <text start="957.55" dur="5.49">because as we move forward and we move</text>
  <text start="960.55" dur="4.95">throughout this month of August into the</text>
  <text start="963.04" dur="4.08">fall I think things are going to</text>
  <text start="965.5" dur="3.8">accelerate</text>
  <text start="967.12" dur="5.7">a way that we&amp;#39;ve never seen before I</text>
  <text start="969.3" dur="6.91">think these this 30 day bombing in Libya</text>
  <text start="972.82" dur="6.99">will not end in 30 days I think it will</text>
  <text start="976.21" dur="5.4">continue I think this is what Obama has</text>
  <text start="979.81" dur="4.14">the authorization to do I think he has</text>
  <text start="981.61" dur="7.08">up to 90 days or so and I think this</text>
  <text start="983.95" dur="7.95">will see this extended and I see right</text>
  <text start="988.69" dur="4.68">now that the Middle East they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="991.9" dur="3.48">to recapture the entire thing this is</text>
  <text start="993.37" dur="3.27">why ashton carter was out there talking</text>
  <text start="995.38" dur="2.49">about that we&amp;#39;re going to have to go</text>
  <text start="996.64" dur="3.42">into all these different countries to</text>
  <text start="997.87" dur="4.44">maintain control and i think they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1000.06" dur="5.07">already started this because we see the</text>
  <text start="1002.31" dur="4.529">US and the coalition forces they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1005.13" dur="4.59">everywhere now we have to remember</text>
  <text start="1006.839" dur="5.641">something very important here during the</text>
  <text start="1009.72" dur="5.07">time going back a couple of months</text>
  <text start="1012.48" dur="4.95">Ashton Carter went around to all the</text>
  <text start="1014.79" dur="7.14">European nations and they all brought in</text>
  <text start="1017.43" dur="7.68">military equipment troops assets they</text>
  <text start="1021.93" dur="7.529">had drills in Jordan all that stuff is</text>
  <text start="1025.11" dur="6.62">still sitting there and I believe they</text>
  <text start="1029.459" dur="6.661">were trying to have this coup in Turkey</text>
  <text start="1031.73" dur="7.12">to ramp up their plans now since this</text>
  <text start="1036.12" dur="6.089">didn&amp;#39;t go well and it was botched their</text>
  <text start="1038.85" dur="5.489">plans have been pushed back but I think</text>
  <text start="1042.209" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;ll have an alternative plan I think</text>
  <text start="1044.339" dur="3.271">they&amp;#39;re going to move forward with it</text>
  <text start="1045.569" dur="4.711">because they&amp;#39;re running out of time and</text>
  <text start="1047.61" dur="5.4">when I say we&amp;#39;re running out of time is</text>
  <text start="1050.28" dur="5.58">they need something to distract everyone</text>
  <text start="1053.01" dur="6.33">from this economic collapse they need</text>
  <text start="1055.86" dur="5.04">some type of an event and we talked</text>

  <text start="1060.9" dur="5.46">many reports and we&amp;#39;re coming up to this</text>
  <text start="1063.42" dur="6.509">point right now where this is going to</text>
  <text start="1066.36" dur="6.29">continue it&amp;#39;s not going to stop and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1069.929" dur="5.25">just going to get worse as time goes on</text>
  <text start="1072.65" dur="4.75">so we need to watch the situation very</text>
  <text start="1075.179" dur="5.521">very carefully because we renting</text>
