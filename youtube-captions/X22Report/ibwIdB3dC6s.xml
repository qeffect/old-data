  <text start="99.289" dur="6.031">Greece the corporate media is out there</text>
  <text start="102.17" dur="5.699">and they are continually trying to</text>
  <text start="105.32" dur="4.53">convince the world that Greece they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="107.869" dur="3.721">coming out of the recession actually</text>
  <text start="109.85" dur="3.06">they were in a depression if you look at</text>
  <text start="111.59" dur="3.6">the unemployment numbers and you look at</text>
  <text start="112.91" dur="6.09">all the information it is a complete</text>
  <text start="115.19" dur="6.8">disaster but they&amp;#39;re telling the world</text>
  <text start="119" dur="6.84">right now that Greece is improving and</text>
  <text start="121.99" dur="5.95">they&amp;#39;re using statistics and we know</text>
  <text start="125.84" dur="4.229">they manipulate statistics like GDP</text>
  <text start="127.94" dur="4.68">unemployment and we know that the</text>
  <text start="130.069" dur="5.131">unemployment rate in Greece is around 25</text>
  <text start="132.62" dur="5.58">percent or so which means that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="135.2" dur="6.06">on a full recovery but we can see right</text>
  <text start="138.2" dur="5.88">now they&amp;#39;re using GDP and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="141.26" dur="6.12">the gross domestic product increased by</text>
  <text start="144.08" dur="6.769">0.5% in the last three months to</text>
  <text start="147.38" dur="7.56">September from the previous quarter and</text>
  <text start="150.849" dur="6.071">they&amp;#39;re saying that they are getting</text>
  <text start="154.94" dur="4.29">ready to go full steam ahead and most</text>
  <text start="156.92" dur="5.039">likely next year their GDP is going to</text>
  <text start="159.23" dur="6.9">be about two point seven percent which</text>
  <text start="161.959" dur="5.64">is absolutely ridiculous and the reason</text>
  <text start="166.13" dur="2.969">why they&amp;#39;re doing this is because they</text>
  <text start="167.599" dur="4.831">want to show that the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="169.099" dur="6.75">they have the ability to help a country</text>
  <text start="172.43" dur="6.96">make it recover while putting them into</text>
  <text start="175.849" dur="5.281">debt more debt and a lot more depth they</text>
  <text start="179.39" dur="6.03">can handle and remem</text>
  <text start="181.13" dur="7.98">at this point in the world the central</text>
  <text start="185.42" dur="6.72">bank they need to prove that the economy</text>
  <text start="189.11" dur="6.36">is doing well and they need to show</text>
  <text start="192.14" dur="5.4">certain countries that yes see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="195.47" dur="4.35">doing well the economy is okay</text>
  <text start="197.54" dur="4.98">everything is fine this is what they do</text>
  <text start="199.82" dur="5.88">before the system comes down they need</text>
  <text start="202.52" dur="4.8">to show that everything&amp;#39;s fine and we</text>
  <text start="205.7" dur="5.18">can see that Greece&amp;#39;s creditors last</text>
  <text start="207.32" dur="7.08">month released about 2.8 billion euros</text>
  <text start="210.88" dur="6.64">for the country&amp;#39;s 86 billion euro</text>
  <text start="214.4" dur="7.47">bailout program now they just gave them</text>
  <text start="217.52" dur="9">more debt but one thing that we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="221.87" dur="7.65">seeing is that how did they improve the</text>
  <text start="226.52" dur="8.48">economy well we know that there was</text>
  <text start="229.52" dur="8.79">austin tea that they were raising taxes</text>
  <text start="235" dur="7.47">pensions were cut public assets were</text>
  <text start="238.31" dur="14.07">transferred there was privatization and</text>
  <text start="242.47" dur="13">the EU was funding the refugee crisis in</text>
  <text start="252.38" dur="9.54">Greece where if they take more refugees</text>
  <text start="255.47" dur="8.61">in they will pay Greece and some experts</text>
  <text start="261.92" dur="6.39">say the economic growth came partly on</text>
  <text start="264.08" dur="6.9">the back of EU extra funding for Greece</text>
  <text start="268.31" dur="6.54">to cope with the massive influx of</text>
  <text start="270.98" dur="5.21">migrants and we can see right now from</text>
  <text start="274.85" dur="5.25">everything that they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="276.19" dur="7.45">economically it really hasn&amp;#39;t improved</text>
  <text start="280.1" dur="5.22">the country at all it&amp;#39;s all this debt</text>
  <text start="283.64" dur="3.45">that they&amp;#39;re pouring into the country</text>
  <text start="285.32" dur="5.1">and the manipulation of these numbers</text>
  <text start="287.09" dur="5.91">that made it look like Greece is doing</text>
  <text start="290.42" dur="4.14">much much better remember back in 2008</text>
  <text start="293" dur="2.88">going forward when they gave him the</text>
  <text start="294.56" dur="3.96">first tranche and they said everything</text>
  <text start="295.88" dur="5.07">is fine here Greece is back on its feet</text>
  <text start="298.52" dur="9.21">and it&amp;#39;s fine then all of a sudden what</text>
  <text start="300.95" dur="9.12">2011 came 2013 came 2015 came and they</text>
  <text start="307.73" dur="3.66">kept ending up in the same problem well</text>
  <text start="310.07" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re going to end up in the same</text>
  <text start="311.39" dur="5.91">problem nothing has changed</text>
  <text start="314.6" dur="5.88">all they have is more debt they sold off</text>
  <text start="317.3" dur="7.5">their assets they raise taxes on whoever</text>
  <text start="320.48" dur="7.5">is left working they cut public pensions</text>
  <text start="324.8" dur="5.07">and nothing&amp;#39;s really improved here in</text>
  <text start="327.98" dur="4.5">the United States the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="329.87" dur="4.89">making a really big deal about retail</text>
  <text start="332.48" dur="3.78">sales everything&amp;#39;s back on track we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="334.76" dur="3.6">all set for the holiday seasons</text>
  <text start="336.26" dur="4.5">everything is fantastic and they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="338.36" dur="4.68">there saying that US retail sales well</text>
  <text start="340.76" dur="3.96">they beat expectations in October we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="343.04" dur="3.09">up by point eight percent we only</text>
  <text start="344.72" dur="4.89">thought we&amp;#39;re going to hit point six</text>
  <text start="346.13" dur="5.04">percent this is incredible they went</text>
  <text start="349.61" dur="6.5">back to September they revise those</text>
  <text start="351.17" dur="7.89">numbers up and when you look at this and</text>
  <text start="356.11" dur="5.41">you look through everything the</text>
  <text start="359.06" dur="6.3">corporate media is telling us we find</text>
  <text start="361.52" dur="7.08">out why did this really happen well as</text>
  <text start="365.36" dur="8.28">the gas prices once again they shot up</text>
  <text start="368.6" dur="7.02">by 2.2% and all of a sudden they added</text>
  <text start="373.64" dur="4.01">that in they said retail is up but when</text>
  <text start="375.62" dur="5.49">you look at furniture department stores</text>
  <text start="377.65" dur="5.47">food services they all saw declines I</text>
  <text start="381.11" dur="4.56">mean if you look at furniture for</text>
  <text start="383.12" dur="4.23">instance what did you see you saw it</text>
  <text start="385.67" dur="4.23">furniture was down by negative point</text>
  <text start="387.35" dur="5.85">nine percent if you looked at department</text>
  <text start="389.9" dur="4.89">stores we see that was down by negative</text>
  <text start="393.2" dur="3.09">point seven percent food service and</text>
  <text start="394.79" dur="6.03">drinking places down negative point</text>
  <text start="396.29" dur="7.44">seven percent so retail is not doing as</text>
  <text start="400.82" dur="4.92">well as they&amp;#39;re making out to be and</text>
  <text start="403.73" dur="4.8">actually if you look at the money of</text>
  <text start="405.74" dur="5.04">where it is and what people are</text>
  <text start="408.53" dur="3.69">purchasing now it doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="410.78" dur="4.95">taking it out of their pockets this</text>
  <text start="412.22" dur="9.15">could also be loans because the first</text>
  <text start="415.73" dur="10.44">three top categories for sales is more</text>
  <text start="421.37" dur="7.65">to vehicles food and beverage and food</text>
  <text start="426.17" dur="8.7">service and drink places so people like</text>
  <text start="429.02" dur="7.26">to drive drink and eat that&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="434.87" dur="7.14">much it that&amp;#39;s what people are doing</text>
  <text start="436.28" dur="8.07">today and we can see right now that the</text>
  <text start="442.01" dur="5.25">motor vehicles well they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="444.35" dur="4.08">using their own money most of the people</text>
  <text start="447.26" dur="5.28">are getting low</text>
  <text start="448.43" dur="6.39">and with food and beverage most of the</text>
  <text start="452.54" dur="7.44">people are using credit cards to go out</text>
  <text start="454.82" dur="6.36">to eat or just to buy food and what</text>
  <text start="459.98" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that you&amp;#39;re over your</text>
  <text start="461.18" dur="4.5">numbers and non store growth suggests</text>
  <text start="463.79" dur="6.45">that more stores will be closing and</text>
  <text start="465.68" dur="8.22">fewer stores will be opening which means</text>
  <text start="470.24" dur="5.49">less jobs even Tory is going to build up</text>
  <text start="473.9" dur="3.93">and this whole thing is going to be a</text>
  <text start="475.73" dur="4.14">complete disaster when we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="477.83" dur="4.2">about automobiles what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="479.87" dur="5.13">interesting in edmonds in the third</text>
  <text start="482.03" dur="6.12">quarter of 2016 they are a used vehicle</text>
  <text start="485" dur="6">market report it reveals that many of</text>
  <text start="488.15" dur="5.49">the same problems afflict the use auto</text>
  <text start="491" dur="5.28">market as it did the new car market and</text>
  <text start="493.64" dur="4.71">what they&amp;#39;re saying is that the</text>
  <text start="496.28" dur="5.19">percentage of used cars being traded in</text>
  <text start="498.35" dur="5.43">with negative equity values continues to</text>
  <text start="501.47" dur="6.38">spike and currently stands at all-time</text>
  <text start="503.78" dur="10.62">high of 25% most of the people are</text>
  <text start="507.85" dur="7.51">underwater in there used car because</text>
  <text start="514.4" dur="3.42">what people are doing they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="515.36" dur="7.5">rolling their negative equity into their</text>
  <text start="517.82" dur="7.59">new loan and many used car buyers are</text>
  <text start="522.86" dur="4.02">sitting on loans where fifteen to twenty</text>
  <text start="525.41" dur="3.9">percent of their outstanding outstanding</text>
  <text start="526.88" dur="4.35">balance simply reflects their negative</text>
  <text start="529.31" dur="5.7">equity from their previous car and they</text>
  <text start="531.23" dur="6.33">continually do this and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="535.01" dur="5.97">seeing right now is most likely this</text>
  <text start="537.56" dur="5.49">Ponzi scheme well it&amp;#39;s going to come</text>
  <text start="540.98" dur="4.53">crashing down at some point it always</text>
  <text start="543.05" dur="3.99">does I know like the pio people like to</text>
  <text start="545.51" dur="4.88">argue that oh no it&amp;#39;s going to be fine</text>
  <text start="547.04" dur="6.21">it always crashes at some point</text>
  <text start="550.39" dur="5.29">something triggers something else in the</text>
  <text start="553.25" dur="5.01">economy and then all of a sudden it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="555.68" dur="6.09">domino effect and it hits all of these</text>
  <text start="558.26" dur="7.01">economic sectors here we see the Empire</text>
  <text start="561.77" dur="7.41">fed it rebounded after last month&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="565.27" dur="6.94">slide but we see that employment</text>
  <text start="569.18" dur="6.57">indicators have tumbled optimism has</text>
  <text start="572.21" dur="6.42">declined and again we&amp;#39;re seeing this</text>
  <text start="575.75" dur="5.4">bounce around during the holiday season</text>
  <text start="578.63" dur="3.75">and if we go back to last year or the</text>
  <text start="581.15" dur="4.71">previous year or</text>
  <text start="582.38" dur="6.54">year before that the Empire fed was much</text>
  <text start="585.86" dur="4.89">higher right now it&amp;#39;s a little bit over</text>
  <text start="588.92" dur="5.37">zero at one point five because it</text>
  <text start="590.75" dur="9.09">bounced back up but if we go back to the</text>
  <text start="594.29" dur="9.96">same period of 2015 it was around five</text>
  <text start="599.84" dur="6.33">if we go back to 2014 it was at 10 so we</text>
  <text start="604.25" dur="4.85">can see right now we are still in a</text>
  <text start="606.17" dur="7.08">downward trend and most likely it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="609.1" dur="8.41">going to drop considerably right after</text>
  <text start="613.25" dur="8.76">the holidays we see the baylands have</text>
  <text start="617.51" dur="9">started out in Italy Monte Paschi well</text>
  <text start="622.01" dur="9.6">they are beginning the balance and we</text>
  <text start="626.51" dur="9.27">can see right now that this whole thing</text>
  <text start="631.61" dur="6.48">is finally a fact ever since the bank</text>
  <text start="635.78" dur="4.86">failed the ECB&amp;#39;s latest stress test the</text>
  <text start="638.09" dur="6.03">summer when it was advised that it needs</text>
  <text start="640.64" dur="8.19">to raise billions in capital well no one</text>
  <text start="644.12" dur="8.64">was willing to source the money that</text>
  <text start="648.83" dur="6.48">they needed so the bank board met on</text>
  <text start="652.76" dur="4.62">Monday they set the terms for bond to</text>
  <text start="655.31" dur="4.74">Equity Conversion that is part of the</text>
  <text start="657.38" dur="5.4">lenders capital boosting plans as part</text>
  <text start="660.05" dur="5.16">of their are sweeping restructuring</text>
  <text start="662.78" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re planning to lay off about a</text>
  <text start="665.21" dur="8.19">tenth of its staff shut branches sell</text>
  <text start="667.7" dur="8.39">assets and they&amp;#39;re going to do a balun</text>
  <text start="673.4" dur="4.65">where they&amp;#39;re going after bondholders</text>
  <text start="676.09" dur="3.91">and what they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="678.05" dur="3.54">going to offer to target bonds for total</text>
  <text start="680" dur="4.65">outstanding amount of about four point</text>
  <text start="681.59" dur="4.98">two eight nine billion euros will offer</text>
  <text start="684.65" dur="3.92">between twenty to one hundred percent of</text>
  <text start="686.57" dur="6.72">nominal value and bond swap offer</text>
  <text start="688.57" dur="6.64">holders of the 4.5 billion euro of bonds</text>
  <text start="693.29" dur="5.19">will be able to convert them to shares</text>
  <text start="695.21" dur="7.02">so we can see already they&amp;#39;re tapping</text>
  <text start="698.48" dur="6.51">the bond holders and as this Bank sinks</text>
  <text start="702.23" dur="4.98">deeper and deeper they will tap the next</text>
  <text start="704.99" dur="6.78">level then the next level and then</text>
  <text start="707.21" dur="7.29">eventually move into the depositors we</text>
  <text start="711.77" dur="4.38">see right now financial conditions they</text>
  <text start="714.5" dur="4.14">are tightening</text>
  <text start="716.15" dur="6.24">at an alarming pace the biz issued a</text>
  <text start="718.64" dur="7.2">warning that the strong dollar may</text>
  <text start="722.39" dur="7.86">simply signal a far greater financial</text>
  <text start="725.84" dur="9.57">system risk as a result of the global</text>
  <text start="730.25" dur="8.46">dollar fund shortage and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="735.41" dur="7.62">saying is that if the Fed decides to</text>
  <text start="738.71" dur="7.71">raise rates we might have a major</text>
  <text start="743.03" dur="6.32">problem like we saw in 2015 and early</text>
  <text start="746.42" dur="6.96">2016 that sent the market into a sharp</text>
  <text start="749.35" dur="7.15">correction and we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="753.38" dur="5.73">economy is still in trouble nothing&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="756.5" dur="6.84">changed and most likely as we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="759.11" dur="6.93">talking about these individuals in the</text>
  <text start="763.34" dur="6.87">shadow government the central bank they</text>
  <text start="766.04" dur="7.19">understand the economy is doomed and we</text>
  <text start="770.21" dur="7.5">know that they&amp;#39;re preparing for QE 4 and</text>
  <text start="773.23" dur="7.84">who knows Trump most likely will be the</text>
  <text start="777.71" dur="5.46">catalyst for this because as we can see</text>
  <text start="781.07" dur="3.45">they need to change their plans once</text>
  <text start="783.17" dur="3.06">again because everything that we talked</text>
  <text start="784.52" dur="3.48">about it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that these</text>
  <text start="786.23" dur="4.59">individuals their plans are going to</text>

  <text start="790.82" dur="5.4">set on we can see what they&amp;#39;re planning</text>
  <text start="793.13" dur="6.44">to do we can look at the indicators but</text>
  <text start="796.22" dur="6.18">again sometimes their plans don&amp;#39;t go as</text>
  <text start="799.57" dur="4.6">they want the way they want sometimes</text>
  <text start="802.4" dur="3.78">they get messed up like they thought</text>
  <text start="804.17" dur="3.66">that Hillary Clinton was going to get</text>
  <text start="806.18" dur="3.33">into the White House they were</text>
  <text start="807.83" dur="4.32">absolutely sure about it I mean if you</text>
  <text start="809.51" dur="5.84">look at the corporate media and you</text>
  <text start="812.15" dur="5.67">listen to the government Obama and</text>
  <text start="815.35" dur="5.95">everyone out there talking about the</text>
  <text start="817.82" dur="8.16">election they made it like it was a joke</text>
  <text start="821.3" dur="7.86">that Trump even had a chance so they</text>
  <text start="825.98" dur="6.39">were all set to go forward with their</text>
  <text start="829.16" dur="6.75">plan of bringing us into a war covering</text>
  <text start="832.37" dur="7.14">up the economic collapse now that Trump</text>
  <text start="835.91" dur="9.18">is going into the white house plans have</text>
  <text start="839.51" dur="8.07">changed wild card I mean will he move to</text>
  <text start="845.09" dur="4.26">the dark side we don&amp;#39;t know yet but we</text>
  <text start="847.58" dur="2.34">can see right now that a lot of things</text>
  <text start="849.35" dur="4.35">are off the</text>
  <text start="849.92" dur="6.06">table where they were going to use war</text>
  <text start="853.7" dur="5.34">and an event to cover up the collapse</text>
  <text start="855.98" dur="5.37">well they can&amp;#39;t do that right now can</text>
  <text start="859.04" dur="6">they use Trump to blame everything on</text>
  <text start="861.35" dur="5.76">him of course they could and we see</text>
  <text start="865.04" dur="4.14">right now they already mentioned QE for</text>
  <text start="867.11" dur="6.33">the federally came out and said listen</text>
  <text start="869.18" dur="6.81">if we enter an economic crisis we can do</text>
  <text start="873.44" dur="4.56">another round of quantitative easing you</text>
  <text start="875.99" dur="3.149">know between 24 trillion I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="878" dur="3.209">going to be a lot more than that because</text>
  <text start="879.139" dur="3.781">the economy is doing a lot worse than</text>
  <text start="881.209" dur="4.74">they believe they&amp;#39;re already setting it</text>
  <text start="882.92" dur="7.01">up saying that Obama did a incredible</text>
  <text start="885.949" dur="7.921">job recovering the entire economy and</text>
  <text start="889.93" dur="7.659">everything is back on track and this is</text>
  <text start="893.87" dur="7.13">what the central bank shadow government</text>
  <text start="897.589" dur="6.661">those in the inside this is what they do</text>
  <text start="901" dur="5.889">to convince you that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="904.25" dur="5.279">right before the system comes down</text>

  <text start="921.589" dur="5.581">be fake news but when then we come to</text>
  <text start="924.649" dur="5.791">learn that all of that was just talk</text>
  <text start="927.17" dur="5.849">they knew everything was a complete</text>
  <text start="930.44" dur="5.16">disaster they knew the economy was</text>
  <text start="933.019" dur="4.411">coming down and what they do is they</text>
  <text start="935.6" dur="3.27">build it up until the very very last</text>
  <text start="937.43" dur="3.63">minute that everything is fine and they</text>
  <text start="938.87" dur="4.409">bring it down this is what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>

  <text start="947.57" dur="7.199">right now is a huge push to let everyone</text>
  <text start="950.63" dur="7.11">know that we have recovered and we know</text>
  <text start="954.769" dur="6.271">that this is not true whatsoever we know</text>
  <text start="957.74" dur="6.3">that this economy has been deteriorating</text>
  <text start="961.04" dur="5.43">declining collapsing for many years and</text>

  <text start="966.47" dur="3.869">been looking at have gotten worse and</text>
  <text start="968.269" dur="5.31">worse and worse actually we&amp;#39;re following</text>
  <text start="970.339" dur="7.921">the same track that we followed back in</text>
  <text start="973.579" dur="7.141">two thousand eight and at one point all</text>
  <text start="978.26" dur="5.45">of this is just going to collapse in a</text>
  <text start="980.72" dur="5.42">split second but we will know that</text>
