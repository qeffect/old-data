  <text start="149.72" dur="5.04">this yes have they improved over time</text>
  <text start="152.3" dur="5.34">yes because this is a new place to go</text>
  <text start="154.76" dur="4.44">shopping over time and is improved but</text>

  <text start="159.2" dur="5.94">stores absolutely not are we seeing an</text>
  <text start="162.349" dur="6.541">equal move from brick-and-mortar over to</text>
  <text start="165.14" dur="7.769">online absolutely not now over this</text>
  <text start="168.89" dur="7.679">fourth of July vacation period we saw</text>
  <text start="172.909" dur="6.211">that retail traffic during the weekend</text>
  <text start="176.569" dur="4.5">well it completely dried up pronto</text>
  <text start="179.12" dur="4.77">retail traffic analytics</text>
  <text start="181.069" dur="5.611">well they revealed that the US consumer</text>
  <text start="183.89" dur="3.22">continued to hibernate into the 4th of</text>
  <text start="186.68" dur="3.13">July</text>
  <text start="187.11" dur="5.34">weekend and store traffic was down by</text>
  <text start="189.81" dur="6">eight point one percent leading up to</text>
  <text start="192.45" dur="5.7">July fourth now we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="195.81" dur="4.56">that people well they don&amp;#39;t have extra</text>
  <text start="198.15" dur="5.19">funds to go out shopping I mean this has</text>
  <text start="200.37" dur="4.5">been proven time and time again and as</text>
  <text start="203.34" dur="3.99">we can see more people who are losing</text>
  <text start="204.87" dur="4.8">their jobs in retail well these people</text>
  <text start="207.33" dur="4.05">don&amp;#39;t have extra funds that go out</text>
  <text start="209.67" dur="3.96">shopping and we can see that</text>
  <text start="211.38" dur="5.88">corporations well they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="213.63" dur="7.29">laying off people now a couple days ago</text>
  <text start="217.26" dur="5.55">we talked about manufacturing and we had</text>
  <text start="220.92" dur="3.38">two different articles out there come</text>
  <text start="222.81" dur="3.72">one coming from market saying that</text>
  <text start="224.3" dur="4.659">manufacturing is declining we don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="226.53" dur="4.38">full growth there it&amp;#39;s not doing well</text>
  <text start="228.959" dur="3.601">then we had Bloomberg which was out</text>
  <text start="230.91" dur="5.31">there saying that manufacturing is doing</text>
  <text start="232.56" dur="7.05">fantastically now we look at the actual</text>
  <text start="236.22" dur="5.61">factory orders month on month and we see</text>
  <text start="239.61" dur="5.31">May orders they&amp;#39;ve tumbled by 0.8</text>
  <text start="241.83" dur="6.09">percent now this is the hard data and</text>
  <text start="244.92" dur="6">the hard data well that is continually</text>
  <text start="247.92" dur="5.22">declining this is a very big slide now</text>
  <text start="250.92" dur="4.41">what we&amp;#39;re looking at is that defense</text>
  <text start="253.14" dur="6.599">aircraft and parts they&amp;#39;re down by</text>
  <text start="255.33" dur="6.719">negative 30 percent so without war guess</text>
  <text start="259.739" dur="5.281">what the economy completely implodes on</text>
  <text start="262.049" dur="5.701">itself and we see that non-defense</text>
  <text start="265.02" dur="5.79">aircraft in parts they&amp;#39;re down 11 eleven</text>
  <text start="267.75" dur="5.7">point six percent so what does this tell</text>
  <text start="270.81" dur="7.59">us it tells us without these things in</text>
  <text start="273.45" dur="7.92">there factory orders non-existent this</text>
  <text start="278.4" dur="5.01">is what we are seeing now out in</text>
  <text start="281.37" dur="5.609">Illinois they&amp;#39;re having major problems</text>
  <text start="283.41" dur="6.45">now the Senate passed the vote to hike</text>
  <text start="286.979" dur="6.061">the income tax by 32 percent the vote</text>
  <text start="289.86" dur="5.82">went through by 72 to 45 and the</text>
  <text start="293.04" dur="5.01">governor vetoed the bill but the Senate</text>
  <text start="295.68" dur="6.87">decided they were going to override this</text>
  <text start="298.05" dur="7.41">and they basically went ahead and they</text>
  <text start="302.55" dur="7.17">said nope we&amp;#39;re going to make this tax</text>
  <text start="305.46" dur="7.53">hike they also approved with a vote of</text>
  <text start="309.72" dur="7.08">thirty nine to fourteen the spending</text>
  <text start="312.99" dur="6.179">bill and the spending bill is a little</text>
  <text start="316.8" dur="4.35">more than thirty six billion and this is</text>
  <text start="319.169" dur="3.961">where you could tell they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="321.15" dur="4.68">l√©a out-of-touch where a lot of these</text>
  <text start="323.13" dur="4.26">government officials they really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="325.83" dur="4.44">understand what&amp;#39;s going on there because</text>
  <text start="327.39" dur="6.12">this spending bill is about four billion</text>
  <text start="330.27" dur="6.93">more than it currently takes in from</text>
  <text start="333.51" dur="6.75">taxes in other words Illinois just saved</text>
  <text start="337.2" dur="6">itself from default by assuring it would</text>
  <text start="340.26" dur="5.61">end up with even more debt because they</text>
  <text start="343.2" dur="5.07">don&amp;#39;t have the taxes to cover this new</text>
  <text start="345.87" dur="4.82">spending bill so they can have to borrow</text>
  <text start="348.27" dur="5.37">the money I mean this is absolutely</text>
  <text start="350.69" dur="6.88">ridiculous now we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="353.64" dur="6.32">many different indicators and these</text>
  <text start="357.57" dur="4.71">indicators are showing that we are</text>
  <text start="359.96" dur="3.91">approaching or we are in a recession</text>
  <text start="362.28" dur="4.26">from everything I&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="363.87" dur="6.23">everything that I&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="366.54" dur="8.82">we are in this recession but there is</text>
  <text start="370.1" dur="9.28">one predictor a single most accurate</text>
  <text start="375.36" dur="6.63">predictor of the economy that it tells</text>
  <text start="379.38" dur="7.8">us that something bad is about to happen</text>
  <text start="381.99" dur="8.16">and when we look at this it&amp;#39;s very hard</text>
  <text start="387.18" dur="5.55">to massage yes can they massage GDP yes</text>
  <text start="390.15" dur="5.01">Khomeini massage unemployment yes when I</text>
  <text start="392.73" dur="4.41">say massage I really mean manipulate can</text>
  <text start="395.16" dur="3.48">they massage or manipulate the is M</text>
  <text start="397.14" dur="4.73">surveys yeah they can manipulate all of</text>
  <text start="398.64" dur="9.56">this stuff but this one indicator is</text>
  <text start="401.87" dur="10.59">very difficult to manipulate it&amp;#39;s tax</text>
  <text start="408.2" dur="7.84">revenue it&amp;#39;s corporate tax revenue and</text>
  <text start="412.46" dur="9.97">when we look at this we can see we have</text>
  <text start="416.04" dur="8.7">a major problem now the corporate tax</text>
  <text start="422.43" dur="5.39">revenue it&amp;#39;s either the taxes are there</text>
  <text start="424.74" dur="8.34">the revenue is there or it is not</text>
  <text start="427.82" dur="7.9">there&amp;#39;s no in between and if the economy</text>
  <text start="433.08" dur="4.89">is booming the corporate tax revenues</text>
  <text start="435.72" dur="5.88">rise as companies generate greater</text>
  <text start="437.97" dur="5.64">revenue and they pay out more taxes they</text>
  <text start="441.6" dur="5.81">hire more people things are fantastic</text>
  <text start="443.61" dur="6.56">and if the economy is rolling over</text>
  <text start="447.41" dur="5.47">corporate tax revenues plunge as</text>
  <text start="450.17" dur="3.95">companies close up shop and stop paying</text>
  <text start="452.88" dur="3.67">taxes</text>
  <text start="454.12" dur="8.7">guess what we are seeing now this</text>
  <text start="456.55" dur="9.21">started back in 2016 and we reported on</text>
  <text start="462.82" dur="4.379">this and this is why I&amp;#39;m saying most</text>
  <text start="465.76" dur="3.87">likely they&amp;#39;re going to go back to</text>
  <text start="467.199" dur="4.591">probably the middle of 2016 and say this</text>
  <text start="469.63" dur="3.84">is when the recession started according</text>
  <text start="471.79" dur="3.96">to the government according to the Fed</text>
  <text start="473.47" dur="5.25">but we&amp;#39;ve been tracking this we know</text>
  <text start="475.75" dur="5.04">this is when this is started now what</text>
  <text start="478.72" dur="4.14">you&amp;#39;re looking at here is you can see</text>
  <text start="480.79" dur="4.5">that state and local corporate tax</text>
  <text start="482.86" dur="6.75">revenues well they have rolled over in a</text>
  <text start="485.29" dur="7.41">massive way if we were to analyze the</text>
  <text start="489.61" dur="6.36">corporate tax chart we would see the</text>
  <text start="492.7" dur="5.79">uptrend of growth and then all of a</text>
  <text start="495.97" dur="5.16">sudden it was broken and we are now</text>
  <text start="498.49" dur="8.7">trending downward we&amp;#39;ve been trending</text>
  <text start="501.13" dur="9.09">downward since 2016 now why does this</text>
  <text start="507.19" dur="6">matter because it serves as a clear</text>
  <text start="510.22" dur="5.42">signal that the US economy is rolling</text>
  <text start="513.19" dur="5.279">over in a big way indeed the last time</text>
  <text start="515.64" dur="5.41">we saw a state and local corporate tax</text>
  <text start="518.469" dur="9.001">revenues roll over like this guess when</text>
  <text start="521.05" dur="9.09">it was late 2007 early 2008 and we all</text>
  <text start="527.47" dur="5.13">know what happened to stocks after that</text>
  <text start="530.14" dur="8.73">the only difference between then and now</text>
  <text start="532.6" dur="10.5">is that the 2017 stock market is much</text>
  <text start="538.87" dur="8.61">much larger we have bigger bubbles the</text>
  <text start="543.1" dur="8.76">economy is built on a house of cards on</text>
  <text start="547.48" dur="9.03">an illusion which is not going to end</text>
  <text start="551.86" dur="7.86">well we all know what happens when these</text>
  <text start="556.51" dur="7.59">things all point to one thing and one</text>
  <text start="559.72" dur="7.65">thing only a recession a depression a</text>
  <text start="564.1" dur="6.78">collapse now think about what Janet</text>
  <text start="567.37" dur="6.05">Yellen said and it&amp;#39;s amazing when she</text>
  <text start="570.88" dur="6.24">said that the timing is incredible</text>
  <text start="573.42" dur="5.74">remember she said there is unlikely to</text>
  <text start="577.12" dur="4.14">be another financial crisis in our</text>
  <text start="579.16" dur="5.34">lifetimes everything is strong it looks</text>
  <text start="581.26" dur="6.3">great now for those people who have been</text>
  <text start="584.5" dur="5.25">through other cycles we see</text>
  <text start="587.56" dur="6.18">this before we&amp;#39;ve seen it many times</text>
  <text start="589.75" dur="9.779">before and if we look we can see that</text>
  <text start="593.74" dur="9.99">back in 2007 Mervyn King of the Bank of</text>
  <text start="599.529" dur="5.701">England said our banking system is much</text>
  <text start="603.73" dur="3.6">more resilient than in the past</text>
  <text start="605.23" dur="4.92">precisely because many of these risks</text>
  <text start="607.33" dur="4.71">are now are no longer on their balance</text>
  <text start="610.15" dur="4.83">sheets but have been sold off to people</text>
  <text start="612.04" dur="6.299">willing and probably more able to bear</text>
  <text start="614.98" dur="7.95">it well we know how that ended</text>
  <text start="618.339" dur="7.201">we ended in a crash economist Rudy Dorne</text>
  <text start="622.93" dur="5.58">Bush a close associate of the Fed vice</text>
  <text start="625.54" dur="5.97">chair Stanley Fischer he wrote back in</text>
  <text start="628.51" dur="6.99">July of 1998 in the wall street journal</text>
  <text start="631.51" dur="6.75">titled growth forever but possibility of</text>
  <text start="635.5" dur="5.06">an imminent recession is remote and the</text>
  <text start="638.26" dur="8.72">country will not see a recession for</text>
  <text start="640.56" dur="9.88">years to come well what happened in 2001</text>
  <text start="646.98" dur="9.07">we saw the dot-com bust we saw a</text>
  <text start="650.44" dur="7.41">recession in 2005 Milton Friedman when</text>
  <text start="656.05" dur="3.89">he could have been paraphrasing Janet</text>
  <text start="657.85" dur="5.64">Yellen where he concluded that the</text>
  <text start="659.94" dur="6.43">stability of the economy is greater than</text>

  <text start="666.37" dur="5.1">really are in a remarkable shape he went</text>

  <text start="704.56" dur="5.49">and here we are with this signal from</text>
  <text start="707.709" dur="4.221">the Fed where they&amp;#39;re saying okay we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="814.28" dur="5.07">up until about 2006 they were rising</text>
  <text start="817.07" dur="4.35">rising rising they dropped a little bit</text>
  <text start="819.35" dur="3.6">then they rose a little bit in 2007 and</text>
  <text start="821.42" dur="5.82">then they started coming straight down</text>
  <text start="822.95" dur="7.86">and all of a sudden we were in a</text>
  <text start="827.24" dur="8.04">recession what do we see now well in</text>

  <text start="846.41" dur="6.09">heading straight down actually we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="848.77" dur="6.8">below the point now where we were when</text>
  <text start="852.5" dur="5.02">the recession started in 2008</text>
  <text start="855.57" dur="4.2">this is why they&amp;#39;re going to go back in</text>
  <text start="857.52" dur="4.95">time and say okay the recession started</text>
