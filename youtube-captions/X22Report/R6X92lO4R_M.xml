  <text start="132.58" dur="4.409">high frequency traders because most</text>
  <text start="135.16" dur="4.409">likely that you&amp;#39;re going to try to pump</text>
  <text start="136.989" dur="5.431">pump this market up as best they</text>
  <text start="139.569" dur="6.871">possibly can for the labor day weekend</text>

  <text start="152.53" dur="4.23">so we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch that</text>
  <text start="153.43" dur="5.28">very carefully and as we know as we go</text>
  <text start="156.76" dur="6.09">forward we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of these</text>
  <text start="158.71" dur="5.67">highs and lows and the corporate media</text>
  <text start="162.85" dur="4.77">the US government the central</text>
  <text start="164.38" dur="5.07">bankers they&amp;#39;re all out there telling us</text>
  <text start="167.62" dur="4.08">that no it&amp;#39;s not our fault we were in a</text>
  <text start="169.45" dur="5.64">recovery everything is absolutely fine</text>
  <text start="171.7" dur="5.55">don&amp;#39;t worry about a thing just go to</text>
  <text start="175.09" dur="4.62">your barbecues whatever you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="177.25" dur="6.48">do this weekend we will take care of</text>
  <text start="179.71" dur="5.46">everything but we&amp;#39;re not going to do</text>
  <text start="183.73" dur="3.42">that we&amp;#39;re going to look at economic</text>
  <text start="185.17" dur="4.8">indicators and we&amp;#39;re going to see why</text>
  <text start="187.15" dur="5.55">these things are really starting to fall</text>
  <text start="189.97" dur="5.7">apart here and we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="192.7" dur="5.88">this for quite a while now and we see</text>
  <text start="195.67" dur="5.34">that ATP has come out with their numbers</text>
  <text start="198.58" dur="6.09">their job numbers and they missed</text>
  <text start="201.01" dur="7.08">expectations and this is following a</text>
  <text start="204.67" dur="5.01">disappointing July which tumbled down so</text>
  <text start="208.09" dur="4.58">far they&amp;#39;ve missed expectations for</text>
  <text start="209.68" dur="5.96">about six of the last seven months</text>
  <text start="212.67" dur="5.41">August ADP printed another mess of about</text>
  <text start="215.64" dur="7.27">190,000 jobs when they were expecting</text>
  <text start="218.08" dur="9.92">about 200,000 and the manufacturing job</text>
  <text start="222.91" dur="7.43">growth is all related to automobiles</text>
  <text start="228" dur="7.9">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="230.34" dur="7.93">the subprime people are the ones that</text>
  <text start="235.9" dur="9.51">are purchasing the cars the government</text>
  <text start="238.27" dur="11.27">is a huge purchaser of cars and all they</text>
  <text start="245.41" dur="7.64">did was prop up the manufacturing of</text>
  <text start="249.54" dur="7.77">automobiles can this be sustained</text>
  <text start="253.05" dur="6.7">absolutely not a lot of the job growth</text>
  <text start="257.31" dur="4.6">if you like to call that was driven by</text>
  <text start="259.75" dur="6.93">small businesses opposed to large</text>
  <text start="261.91" dur="9.96">businesses and we have noticed that the</text>
  <text start="266.68" dur="8.37">jobs data has dropped year on year for</text>
  <text start="271.87" dur="8.6">the last month&amp;#39;s so when you look back</text>
  <text start="275.05" dur="9.09">you see that the job data is really ugly</text>
  <text start="280.47" dur="7.75">we haven&amp;#39;t gone anywhere and the jobs</text>
  <text start="284.14" dur="6.84">that were created they&amp;#39;re all low-paying</text>
  <text start="288.22" dur="6.18">jobs because think about this for a</text>
  <text start="290.98" dur="6.82">second yesterday reported on how these</text>
  <text start="294.4" dur="5.5">major banks are laying off ten</text>
  <text start="297.8" dur="5.179">of thousands of people we know the</text>
  <text start="299.9" dur="5.82">energy sector has laid off hundreds of</text>
  <text start="302.979" dur="5.081">thousands of people we know the retail</text>
  <text start="305.72" dur="5.21">sector has been laying off tens of</text>
  <text start="308.06" dur="6.889">thousands of people large corporations</text>
  <text start="310.93" dur="8.85">laying off tens of thousands of people</text>
  <text start="314.949" dur="9.101">what jobs are these people getting and</text>
  <text start="319.78" dur="9.669">we see right now that this strong jobs</text>
  <text start="324.05" dur="7.47">recovery is a complete lie ecri notes</text>
  <text start="329.449" dur="4.381">the sustained decline in the official</text>
  <text start="331.52" dur="4.35">jobless rate now approaching the feds</text>
  <text start="333.83" dur="4.92">estimate of full employment is a</text>
  <text start="335.87" dur="4.859">misleading indicator of labor market</text>
  <text start="338.75" dur="5.069">slack the data shows that the so-called</text>
  <text start="340.729" dur="7.051">jobs recovery has been spearheaded by</text>
  <text start="343.819" dur="6.06">cheap labor with no job gains going</text>
  <text start="347.78" dur="6.9">disproportionately to the least educated</text>
  <text start="349.879" dur="6.271">and lowest paid workers and as we know</text>
  <text start="354.68" dur="3.84">those people who are going back to</text>
  <text start="356.15" dur="7.23">college getting themselves into debt</text>
  <text start="358.52" dur="8.759">then graduating they cannot find work in</text>
  <text start="363.38" dur="6.3">their field a lot of people are taking</text>
  <text start="367.279" dur="6.091">part time work still living with their</text>
  <text start="369.68" dur="5.45">parents after dropping two three decade</text>
  <text start="373.37" dur="5.09">lows in the wake of the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="375.13" dur="7.36">the employment population ratio has</text>
  <text start="378.46" dur="6.549">barely improved since the fall of 2013</text>
  <text start="382.49" dur="5.01">reversing only about one-fifth of its</text>
  <text start="385.009" dur="4.981">decline from its procession</text>
  <text start="387.5" dur="5.279">pre-recession highs furthermore as a</text>
  <text start="389.99" dur="6.829">breakdown of the EP ratio by education</text>
  <text start="392.779" dur="8.79">it shows this modest improvement is an</text>
  <text start="396.819" dur="7.9">illusion and it is an illusion there is</text>
  <text start="401.569" dur="5.521">no improvement and they keep saying Oh</text>
  <text start="404.719" dur="5.931">wage growth wage growth well guess what</text>
  <text start="407.09" dur="7.049">there is no wage growth here in the US</text>
  <text start="410.65" dur="4.93">unit unit labor costs dropped one point</text>
  <text start="414.139" dur="4.08">four percent in the second quarter</text>
  <text start="415.58" dur="5.339">missing expectations of a 1.2 drop and</text>
  <text start="418.219" dur="5.281">fallen to the lowest since the second</text>
  <text start="420.919" dur="5.071">quarter of 2014 despite all the sound of</text>
  <text start="423.5" dur="7.72">fury and wage growth looming any minute</text>
  <text start="425.99" dur="7.93">now it isn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s not happening this</text>
  <text start="431.22" dur="4.77">the first consecutive drop in unit labor</text>
  <text start="433.92" dur="5.94">costs since the fourth quarter of two</text>
  <text start="435.99" dur="5.82">thousand eight so those people who are</text>
  <text start="439.86" dur="4.62">working right now sending out their</text>
  <text start="441.81" dur="3.99">resumes and I know many people who are</text>
  <text start="444.48" dur="4.59">doing this right now looking for other</text>
  <text start="445.8" dur="5.82">jobs they cannot find work and if they</text>
  <text start="449.07" dur="5.28">do the pay is a little less than what</text>
  <text start="451.62" dur="6.42">they&amp;#39;re earning doesn&amp;#39;t make sense does</text>
  <text start="454.35" dur="9.81">it and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="458.04" dur="8.19">the ultra poor has doubled since 1996</text>
  <text start="464.16" dur="6.3">they&amp;#39;ve been living on absolutely</text>
  <text start="466.23" dur="7.08">nothing the number of us residents who</text>
  <text start="470.46" dur="7.85">are now struggling to survive they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="473.31" dur="8.13">doing it on two dollars a day it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="478.31" dur="5.83">unbelievable to think of this placing</text>
  <text start="481.44" dur="5.13">1.5 million households and three million</text>
  <text start="484.14" dur="7.89">children in the desperate economic</text>
  <text start="486.57" dur="9.09">situation this is a recovery what is a</text>
  <text start="492.03" dur="6.21">collapse going to look like and of</text>
  <text start="495.66" dur="5.7">course the United States government the</text>
  <text start="498.24" dur="4.89">corporate media they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="501.36" dur="5.76">trying to convince us that everything is</text>
  <text start="503.13" dur="9.15">fine we&amp;#39;re okay but when we look at</text>
  <text start="507.12" dur="9.57">manufacturing what do we see well we see</text>
  <text start="512.28" dur="10.699">manufacturing declining we see factory</text>
  <text start="516.69" dur="10.17">orders they have crashed 14.7 percent I</text>
  <text start="522.979" dur="9.791">mean they pushed it up because Boeing</text>
  <text start="526.86" dur="9.15">had a big order since that time factory</text>
  <text start="532.77" dur="7.14">orders are non-existent new orders</text>
  <text start="536.01" dur="6.72">tumbled by point 6 in July plunging six</text>
  <text start="539.91" dur="6.09">point nine percent year-on-year this is</text>
  <text start="542.73" dur="7.56">the ninth month in a row of year on your</text>
  <text start="546" dur="6.48">drops and is without doubt signaling you</text>
  <text start="550.29" dur="6.27">can say recession you can say depression</text>
  <text start="552.48" dur="5.7">I&amp;#39;m going to say a collapse and when we</text>
  <text start="556.56" dur="4.26">look at this you know where all these</text>
  <text start="558.18" dur="5.98">orders are coming from that that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="560.82" dur="6.999">talking about they&amp;#39;re from autos</text>
  <text start="564.16" dur="6.39">the manufacturers are continually</text>
  <text start="567.819" dur="6.51">pumping out cars channel stuffing the</text>
  <text start="570.55" dur="6.18">Lots the government stepping in buying</text>
  <text start="574.329" dur="6.601">what thirty-eight percent of the autos</text>
  <text start="576.73" dur="7.44">from the American companies this whole</text>
  <text start="580.93" dur="5.159">thing is a complete illusion to make you</text>
  <text start="584.17" dur="3.899">think everything is fine they are</text>
  <text start="586.089" dur="6.06">basically doing whatever they possibly</text>
  <text start="588.069" dur="8.281">can to keep the illusion in front of</text>
  <text start="592.149" dur="8.31">everyone that we&amp;#39;re in a recovery but</text>
  <text start="596.35" dur="8.7">we&amp;#39;re not we are nowhere near any type</text>
  <text start="600.459" dur="9.511">of recovery whatsoever this economy this</text>
  <text start="605.05" dur="7.289">market has been collapsing since 2008 so</text>
  <text start="609.97" dur="5.63">what we have is the illusion of their</text>
  <text start="612.339" dur="6.75">manipulated numbers the government</text>
  <text start="615.6" dur="7.69">spending and borrowing as much as they</text>
  <text start="619.089" dur="7.471">possibly can to keep this economy up and</text>
  <text start="623.29" dur="7.02">running the central bank is doing the</text>
  <text start="626.56" dur="6.42">same while the people are sitting on the</text>
  <text start="630.31" dur="7.92">sidelines going what is this going to</text>
  <text start="632.98" dur="7.68">improve this is why people when the</text>
  <text start="638.23" dur="3.719">Gallup did a poll saying the economy is</text>
  <text start="640.66" dur="3.27">going to get worse fifty-eight percent</text>
  <text start="641.949" dur="4.921">of the people said this when we had the</text>
  <text start="643.93" dur="4.649">sponsored poll by the government they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="646.87" dur="4.649">telling us that everything is fine I</text>
  <text start="648.579" dur="5.971">mean think about it here and we know the</text>
  <text start="651.519" dur="5.82">next crisis is going to be much much</text>
  <text start="654.55" dur="5.25">worse than two thousand eight right now</text>
  <text start="657.339" dur="5.31">the current global monetary system is</text>
  <text start="659.8" dur="4.469">basically based on debt now let&amp;#39;s break</text>
  <text start="662.649" dur="5.851">this down and how this might play out</text>
  <text start="664.269" dur="6.781">here according to the central bank debt</text>
  <text start="668.5" dur="4.47">is money and at the top of the debt</text>
  <text start="671.05" dur="4.019">pyramid our sovereign bonds us</text>
  <text start="672.97" dur="3.989">treasuries german bonds japanese</text>
  <text start="675.069" dur="3.841">government bonds these are the</text>
  <text start="676.959" dur="4.651">senior-most assets used as collateral</text>
  <text start="678.91" dur="5.76">for interbank loans and derivative</text>
  <text start="681.61" dur="6.419">trades this is what makes up our</text>
  <text start="684.67" dur="6.99">financial system so this time around</text>
  <text start="688.029" dur="6.17">when this bubble completely bursts it</text>
  <text start="691.66" dur="6.24">won&amp;#39;t simply just affect a particular</text>
  <text start="694.199" dur="8.471">sector or area or any</text>
  <text start="697.9" dur="7.83">a specific asset class it will it will</text>
  <text start="702.67" dur="5.63">affect the entire system that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="705.73" dur="5.3">we&amp;#39;re going to see happen right now and</text>
  <text start="708.3" dur="6.19">like we saw back with the tech bubble</text>
  <text start="711.03" dur="8.49">which took about three years for it to</text>
  <text start="714.49" dur="8.19">completely unwind the next time around</text>
  <text start="719.52" dur="5.38">it&amp;#39;s going to take the same amount of</text>
  <text start="722.68" dur="4.35">time and it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot worse so</text>
  <text start="724.9" dur="4.44">when it hits there&amp;#39;s not going to be</text>
  <text start="727.03" dur="5.97">recovery that&amp;#39;s going to happen very</text>
  <text start="729.34" dur="6.39">very quickly this bubble is not confined</text>
  <text start="733" dur="5.43">to one country globally the bomb bubble</text>
  <text start="735.73" dur="4.95">is about a hundred trillion in size the</text>
  <text start="738.43" dur="4.86">bubble is not confined to one asset</text>
  <text start="740.68" dur="4.32">class the central banks will do</text>
  <text start="743.29" dur="6.3">everything they can to stop this from</text>
  <text start="745" dur="7.23">happening and basically try to keep</text>
  <text start="749.59" dur="5.61">everything propped up but when the</text>
  <text start="752.23" dur="5.49">bubble bursts they will vary cert that</text>
  <text start="755.2" dur="7.62">they will basically have very serious</text>
  <text start="757.72" dur="8.04">problems here and people are going to</text>
  <text start="762.82" dur="5.88">look at this and say okay who caused</text>
  <text start="765.76" dur="6.18">this to happen and this is where the</text>
  <text start="768.7" dur="5.04">problem comes in because everyone</text>
  <text start="771.94" dur="4.5">realizes at this point that the central</text>
  <text start="773.74" dur="3.69">bank has been pumping all of this up and</text>
  <text start="776.44" dur="2.85">everyone&amp;#39;s going to point the finger at</text>
  <text start="777.43" dur="6.06">the central bank and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="779.29" dur="6">people to realize that it was them so</text>
  <text start="783.49" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re going to try to shift the blame</text>
  <text start="785.29" dur="6.45">which we&amp;#39;re seeing right now I mean</text>
  <text start="788.47" dur="8.78">right now this bubble is larger than</text>
  <text start="791.74" dur="7.89">anything the world has ever seen and</text>
  <text start="797.25" dur="4.42">when you consider that these bonds are</text>
  <text start="799.63" dur="5.97">pledged as collateral for other</text>
  <text start="801.67" dur="8.13">securities like derivatives the full</text>
  <text start="805.6" dur="8.63">impact of his pond bubble is about five</text>
  <text start="809.8" dur="7.41">hundred and fifty five trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="814.23" dur="5.79">let&amp;#39;s put this into perspective the</text>
  <text start="817.21" dur="5.97">credit default swap market net took down</text>
  <text start="820.02" dur="6.58">which nearly i should say took down the</text>
  <text start="823.18" dur="8.49">financial system in 2008 was about 50</text>
  <text start="826.6" dur="9">trillion or so right now it&amp;#39;s 555</text>
  <text start="831.67" dur="10.26">five trillion so you can see this is a</text>
  <text start="835.6" dur="8.1">hundred times worse now what do the</text>
  <text start="841.93" dur="4.41">central banks have done what have they</text>
  <text start="843.7" dur="5.7">done to push this off well the central</text>
  <text start="846.34" dur="7.8">bank&amp;#39;s cut interest rates to make these</text>
  <text start="849.4" dur="8.1">debts more serviceable the central banks</text>
  <text start="854.14" dur="5.34">want target inflation because it makes</text>
  <text start="857.5" dur="4.02">the debts more servable serviceable and</text>
  <text start="859.48" dur="4.65">puts off the innovative inevitable debt</text>
  <text start="861.52" dur="7.65">restructuring the central banks are</text>
  <text start="864.13" dur="7.29">terrified of debt deflation because it</text>
  <text start="869.17" dur="5.28">would burst the bond bubble and bankrupt</text>
  <text start="871.42" dur="6.63">sovereign nations so how is this going</text>
  <text start="874.45" dur="7.77">to play out well when it hits capital</text>
  <text start="878.05" dur="10.19">will fly into high quality bonds us</text>
  <text start="882.22" dur="11.78">treasuries or so and the bond market is</text>
  <text start="888.24" dur="13.6">basically going to accelerate and</text>
  <text start="894" dur="12.61">completely collapse on itself and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="901.84" dur="8.67">going to see a major disaster something</text>
  <text start="906.61" dur="7.29">that we haven&amp;#39;t seen before it will be</text>
  <text start="910.51" dur="7.38">so horrific people will talk about this</text>
  <text start="913.9" dur="10.26">for decades and we can see it&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="917.89" dur="9.93">starting I mean out in Sweden they tried</text>
  <text start="924.16" dur="7.38">QE it completely failed and right now</text>
  <text start="927.82" dur="7.53">banks they&amp;#39;re refusing to open savings</text>
  <text start="931.54" dur="5.79">accounts and they&amp;#39;re saying if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="935.35" dur="5.28">going to open up a savings account we</text>
  <text start="937.33" dur="6.12">want everything your salary deposits</text>
  <text start="940.63" dur="4.47">your savings any of everything that we</text>
  <text start="943.45" dur="4.14">can get our hands on so you just can&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="947.59" dur="6.6">everything over and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="951.85" dur="5.58">see a lot of this where you know the</text>
  <text start="954.19" dur="5.73">banks are looking for more and more to</text>
  <text start="957.43" dur="5.93">bring into the banking system because as</text>
  <text start="959.92" dur="5.52">time goes on what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="963.36" dur="6.1">there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="965.44" dur="6.9">ballons now christine lagarde she was at</text>
  <text start="969.46" dur="6.57">a conference in the indonesian capital</text>
  <text start="972.34" dur="7.56">of asia and she was talking about the</text>
  <text start="976.03" dur="5.79">global economy saying that there are</text>
  <text start="979.9" dur="7.02">many imbalances in the market in Asia</text>
  <text start="981.82" dur="9.06">and this could spread to the rest of the</text>
  <text start="986.92" dur="8.28">world and she&amp;#39;s saying that right now</text>
  <text start="990.88" dur="6.09">the markets are so volatile that this</text>
  <text start="995.2" dur="3.99">whole thing could come down at any</text>
  <text start="996.97" dur="5.97">moment that&amp;#39;s basically what she&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="999.19" dur="7.41">of saying and at the same time she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1002.94" dur="9.14">pointing the finger at China as the</text>
  <text start="1006.6" dur="10.68">cause of all of this and we know that</text>
  <text start="1012.08" dur="7.66">china is not the cause it&amp;#39;s a symptom of</text>
  <text start="1017.28" dur="4.62">what is happening here because this</text>
  <text start="1019.74" dur="4.29">whole thing was put into motion a long</text>
  <text start="1021.9" dur="4.14">time ago back in nineteen seventy</text>
  <text start="1024.03" dur="5.25">actually if we go further back to</text>
  <text start="1026.04" dur="5.279">nineteen thirteen when the central bank</text>
  <text start="1029.28" dur="3.62">was created the Federal Reserve which is</text>
  <text start="1031.319" dur="4.311">not part of the government whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1032.9" dur="5.65">going forward up to nineteen seventy</text>
  <text start="1035.63" dur="4.809">when we came off the gold standard this</text>
  <text start="1038.55" dur="4.05">whole thing was put into motion and they</text>
  <text start="1040.439" dur="6.9">knew at that point in time that this</text>
  <text start="1042.6" dur="7.35">Fiat system would only last for 40 to 45</text>
  <text start="1047.339" dur="4.741">years and then it would collapse now of</text>
  <text start="1049.95" dur="4.62">course they try to back this currency on</text>
  <text start="1052.08" dur="5.19">with the petro dollar but it what</text>
  <text start="1054.57" dur="5.82">happened was that didn&amp;#39;t matter because</text>
  <text start="1057.27" dur="7.2">they continually created more and more</text>
  <text start="1060.39" dur="6.42">money non-stop this is why we see an</text>
  <text start="1064.47" dur="5.64">acceleration of this because every time</text>
  <text start="1066.81" dur="7.13">a Fiat system collapses we see a huge</text>
  <text start="1070.11" dur="9.33">acceleration of printing creation of</text>
  <text start="1073.94" dur="9.61">money or i should say currency and other</text>
  <text start="1079.44" dur="9.81">nations like Russia China brick systems</text>
  <text start="1083.55" dur="8.75">they realize that this dollar is going</text>
  <text start="1089.25" dur="6.33">to collapse and this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1092.3" dur="6.49">purchasing gold not just since yesterday</text>
  <text start="1095.58" dur="3.84">for a very long time they&amp;#39;re separating</text>
  <text start="1098.79" dur="2.79">themselves</text>
  <text start="1099.42" dur="3.99">from everything that has to do with the</text>
  <text start="1101.58" dur="3.71">private western central bank they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1103.41" dur="6.02">creating their own payment system</text>
  <text start="1105.29" dur="9.58">they&amp;#39;re trading in their own currencies</text>
  <text start="1109.43" dur="9.43">Putin is preparing a bill that will dump</text>
  <text start="1114.87" dur="6.38">the dollar in trade because they know</text>
  <text start="1118.86" dur="5.4">eventually this system is coming down</text>
  <text start="1121.25" dur="5.11">and we see the u.s. is continually</text>
  <text start="1124.26" dur="3.39">putting pressure on Russia because</text>
  <text start="1126.36" dur="3.3">what&amp;#39;s happening in Ukraine and they</text>
  <text start="1127.65" dur="8.28">realize eventually they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="1129.66" dur="8.76">to get into war and they just imposed</text>
  <text start="1135.93" dur="4.08">more sanctions on Russia the US</text>
  <text start="1138.42" dur="3.6">Department of Commerce added new</text>
  <text start="1140.01" dur="4.56">entities from Russia on other countries</text>
  <text start="1142.02" dur="5.85">in its list of sanctions over Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1144.57" dur="6.57">conflict 39 people under thirty three</text>
  <text start="1147.87" dur="5.01">entries had been included in the entity</text>
  <text start="1151.14" dur="5.22">list now it&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="1152.88" dur="8.34">this is that they include a MIG aircraft</text>
  <text start="1156.36" dur="6.3">production manufacturer and I think what</text>
  <text start="1161.22" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re trying to do is stop the sales</text>
  <text start="1162.66" dur="4.02">of MiG&amp;#39;s and other weapons to other</text>
  <text start="1165.21" dur="3.39">countries right now and this is why they</text>
  <text start="1166.68" dur="6.81">impose sanctions so other countries</text>
  <text start="1168.6" dur="6.9">cannot deal with Russia and Russia is</text>
  <text start="1173.49" dur="4.41">saying that contracts that are already</text>
  <text start="1175.5" dur="5.7">in existence it will not affect them but</text>
  <text start="1177.9" dur="4.77">maybe it will affect new contracts and</text>
  <text start="1181.2" dur="5.79">Russia is out there saying that they</text>
  <text start="1182.67" dur="7.5">will respond to new to the new US</text>
  <text start="1186.99" dur="6.39">sanctions somehow someway like they did</text>
