  <text start="57.789" dur="6.72">episode 1430 for a n today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.3" dur="5.97">November 28th 2017 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="64.509" dur="4.97">episode is hundreds of European banks</text>
  <text start="67.27" dur="5.94">are in trouble this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="69.479" dur="6.011">disaster let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="73.21" dur="4.29">collapse financial news now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="75.49" dur="3.39">watching the precious metals market and</text>
  <text start="77.5" dur="4.35">we noticed in the last couple of weeks</text>
  <text start="78.88" dur="6.72">there&amp;#39;s been a lot of paper contracts</text>
  <text start="81.85" dur="6.45">thrown at gold and it&amp;#39;s brought down the</text>
  <text start="85.6" dur="5.699">price and we&amp;#39;ve known we&amp;#39;ve noticed that</text>
  <text start="88.3" dur="5.519">this is continually happening and it</text>
  <text start="91.299" dur="5.21">happens around 9:30 or so in the morning</text>
  <text start="93.819" dur="5.66">Eastern Standard Time and once again</text>
  <text start="96.509" dur="6.821">gold was slammed down this morning</text>
  <text start="99.479" dur="8.291">silver was also slammed back below $17</text>
  <text start="103.33" dur="7.739">now these slam downs are now happening</text>
  <text start="107.77" dur="6.51">more often which tells us they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="111.069" dur="5.071">want gold and silver to rise they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="114.28" dur="4.199">trying to keep everyone distracted</text>
  <text start="116.14" dur="5.04">thinking that everything is great that</text>
  <text start="118.479" dur="4.981">the dollar is fantastic gold and silver</text>
  <text start="121.18" dur="4.829">they&amp;#39;re not going anywhere and this</text>
  <text start="123.46" dur="5.189">tells us that we&amp;#39;re getting closer and</text>
  <text start="126.009" dur="4.32">closer to the system completely ripping</text>
  <text start="128.649" dur="3.81">itself apart and if we look at the</text>
  <text start="130.329" dur="4.321">crypto market we can see that the crypto</text>
  <text start="132.459" dur="3.721">currencies they are going up like</text>
  <text start="134.65" dur="2.76">there&amp;#39;s no tomorrow and of course people</text>
  <text start="136.18" dur="3.119">are out there saying there&amp;#39;s a bubble</text>
  <text start="137.41" dur="3.359">happening but again there are many</text>
  <text start="139.299" dur="3.66">people out there that don&amp;#39;t even know</text>
  <text start="140.769" dur="4.081">how to get into the crypto market they</text>
  <text start="142.959" dur="5.101">hear about it they know something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="144.85" dur="6">going on but still it&amp;#39;s a very small</text>
  <text start="148.06" dur="5.549">piece of the pie that are actually</text>
  <text start="150.85" dur="5.1">dealing in crypto currencies and we see</text>
  <text start="153.609" dur="4.831">right now that the crypto market kind of</text>
  <text start="155.95" dur="4.65">emulates what gold and silver should be</text>
  <text start="158.44" dur="3.87">doing right now and I think this is why</text>
  <text start="160.6" dur="3.63">the central bankers and those in power</text>
  <text start="162.31" dur="3.239">getting a little worried and this is why</text>
  <text start="164.23" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re continually keeping the gold and</text>
  <text start="165.549" dur="3.991">silver prices down and once again like I</text>
  <text start="167.65" dur="3.27">said before we should be looking at</text>
  <text start="169.54" dur="3.27">everything not just let move we should</text>
  <text start="170.92" dur="2.58">be in gold and silver we should just be</text>
  <text start="172.81" dur="3.42">encrypt Oh</text>
  <text start="173.5" dur="4.459">currencies we should be in everything a</text>
  <text start="176.23" dur="5.19">little bit here a little bit there</text>
  <text start="177.959" dur="5.89">diversified even dollars because when</text>
  <text start="181.42" dur="4.56">the system comes down you&amp;#39;re gonna need</text>
  <text start="183.849" dur="3.72">dollars what we see inflation</text>
  <text start="185.98" dur="3.81">occurring and people are out there</text>
  <text start="187.569" dur="5.221">trying to purchase their goods you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="189.79" dur="5.04">going to use the dollars first the</text>
  <text start="192.79" dur="3.36">cryptocurrency and the gold will be used</text>
  <text start="194.83" dur="3.78">much later you&amp;#39;ll probably move into</text>
  <text start="196.15" dur="4.35">bartering before you even touch any of</text>
  <text start="198.61" dur="4.68">the other things the other things are to</text>
  <text start="200.5" dur="6.03">maintain your wealth and most likely</text>
  <text start="203.29" dur="5.43">down the line we might go into an</text>
  <text start="206.53" dur="4.59">electronic currency like crypto currency</text>
  <text start="208.72" dur="5.22">where if you have gold you can use it to</text>
  <text start="211.12" dur="5.22">buy some crypto coins and things like</text>
  <text start="213.94" dur="5.21">that so we need to look at the entire</text>
  <text start="216.34" dur="5.67">picture here not just one little thing</text>
  <text start="219.15" dur="4.839">we also see the retail market is a</text>
  <text start="222.01" dur="4.5">complete and utter disaster and I know</text>
  <text start="223.989" dur="4.83">that the corporate media they&amp;#39;re all out</text>
  <text start="226.51" dur="5.729">there and I hear people saying wow this</text>
  <text start="228.819" dur="4.591">Black Friday was fantastic just listen</text>
  <text start="232.239" dur="3.451">to what the news is saying I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="233.41" dur="4.59">believe how much better it is cyber</text>
  <text start="235.69" dur="4.35">monday they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s incredible</text>
  <text start="238" dur="4.65">but once again you need to look at what</text>
  <text start="240.04" dur="5.88">has happened during this year now the</text>
  <text start="242.65" dur="7.53">number of retail store closes in 2017</text>
  <text start="245.92" dur="7.56">has already tripled the number from 2016</text>
  <text start="250.18" dur="5.429">last year there was about 2000 stores</text>
  <text start="253.48" dur="5.159">that closed this year were already up to</text>
  <text start="255.609" dur="5.85">67 hundred and we could see right now</text>
  <text start="258.639" dur="5.761">that this is shattered all-time records</text>
  <text start="261.459" dur="5.64">because in 2008 the all-time record was</text>
  <text start="264.4" dur="5.97">61 hundred stores so if we&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="267.099" dur="4.771">incredible recovery well why are all</text>
  <text start="270.37" dur="2.7">these stores closing now of course I</text>
  <text start="271.87" dur="2.46">know people are gonna be out there</text>
  <text start="273.07" dur="3.659">saying and of course two people listen</text>
  <text start="274.33" dur="4.05">to me are not gonna say it but other</text>
  <text start="276.729" dur="5.041">people are gonna say well it&amp;#39;s all going</text>
  <text start="278.38" dur="7.14">to online again online sales only makes</text>
  <text start="281.77" dur="5.1">up around 10% of the entire retail</text>
  <text start="285.52" dur="3.869">market and it&amp;#39;s not a one-to-one</text>
  <text start="286.87" dur="5.31">transfer over to Amazon Amazon has been</text>
  <text start="289.389" dur="4.561">around for a very long time it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="292.18" dur="3.45">like they just popped up and said hey</text>
  <text start="293.95" dur="3.21">we&amp;#39;re taking all your business they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="295.63" dur="4.59">been around for a very long time yes the</text>
  <text start="297.16" dur="6.3">online market is growing but it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="300.22" dur="6.36">the market yet it&amp;#39;s only ten eleven</text>
  <text start="303.46" dur="5.37">percent of the entire retail market what</text>
  <text start="306.58" dur="5.13">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that all of</text>
  <text start="308.83" dur="5.1">these stores that are closing well they</text>
  <text start="311.71" dur="4.55">just don&amp;#39;t have the traffic they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="313.93" dur="4.979">have the sales people aren&amp;#39;t out there</text>
  <text start="316.26" dur="3.49">purchasing that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="318.909" dur="2.971">happening</text>
  <text start="319.75" dur="3.27">now and we see there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="321.88" dur="2.79">retailers that have gone bankrupt</text>
  <text start="323.02" dur="3.99">already and I&amp;#39;m going to tell you right</text>
  <text start="324.67" dur="4.02">now just from the data that&amp;#39;s coming in</text>
  <text start="327.01" dur="3.48">not what the corporate media is telling</text>
  <text start="328.69" dur="4.14">you not the propaganda about how great</text>
  <text start="330.49" dur="4.71">cyber my cyber monday is in Black Friday</text>
  <text start="332.83" dur="5.61">and once again if these days are so</text>
  <text start="335.2" dur="6.57">great they wouldn&amp;#39;t have to extend any</text>
  <text start="338.44" dur="5.88">of the sales once you hear someone</text>
  <text start="341.77" dur="4.56">saying well we&amp;#39;re going to extend cyber</text>
  <text start="344.32" dur="4.65">monday because it&amp;#39;s been so great now</text>
  <text start="346.33" dur="4.5">that tells you that cyber monday is not</text>
  <text start="348.97" dur="3.99">that great and they&amp;#39;re gonna continue on</text>
  <text start="350.83" dur="4.2">with the sale to try to get more sales</text>
  <text start="352.96" dur="4.44">because it&amp;#39;s not what they thought it</text>
  <text start="355.03" dur="3.54">was going to be and they&amp;#39;re below the</text>
  <text start="357.4" dur="4.08">number of sales that they thought they</text>
  <text start="358.57" dur="4.77">should have so this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="361.48" dur="4.32">hearing right now and this is why they</text>
  <text start="363.34" dur="4.26">started the Black Friday sales way ahead</text>
  <text start="365.8" dur="3.57">of schedule this is why they wanted</text>
  <text start="367.6" dur="3.72">stores open on Thanksgiving which really</text>
  <text start="369.37" dur="3">didn&amp;#39;t work out in the past and they</text>
  <text start="371.32" dur="3.51">continually trying all these different</text>
  <text start="372.37" dur="5.34">things to try to boost sales but what</text>
  <text start="374.83" dur="6">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that people aren&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="377.71" dur="5.37">out and purchasing yes you&amp;#39;re gonna hear</text>
  <text start="380.83" dur="4.92">that oh mobile sales are on the rise of</text>
  <text start="383.08" dur="4.89">course apps are getting better but it</text>
  <text start="385.75" dur="6.15">did it take over the entire retail</text>
  <text start="387.97" dur="5.49">market the brick-and-mortar no just</text>
  <text start="391.9" dur="4.68">because you hear what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="393.46" dur="5.67">that oh it&amp;#39;s doing a lot better or this</text>
  <text start="396.58" dur="5.43">is the most popular online way to</text>
  <text start="399.13" dur="6.81">purchase doesn&amp;#39;t mean that sales are</text>
  <text start="402.01" dur="6.24">great it&amp;#39;s a propaganda move to make you</text>
  <text start="405.94" dur="4.65">think that things are doing better but</text>
  <text start="408.25" dur="4.35">when you look at the hard numbers here</text>
  <text start="410.59" dur="4.46">like the traffic to all these stores</text>
  <text start="412.6" dur="6.03">you&amp;#39;re looking at four to six percent</text>
  <text start="415.05" dur="5.86">decline of traffic compared to last year</text>
  <text start="418.63" dur="4.95">and last year was a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="420.91" dur="4.23">and once we get these retail numbers</text>
  <text start="423.58" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;re gonna see that it&amp;#39;s gonna be a lot</text>
  <text start="425.14" dur="4.11">worse than what they&amp;#39;re saying we see</text>
  <text start="427.36" dur="4.2">that Case Shiller is out there and again</text>
  <text start="429.25" dur="4.38">they have this 20-city composite and</text>
  <text start="431.56" dur="4.169">they&amp;#39;re saying that houses are surging</text>
  <text start="433.63" dur="3.539">like we&amp;#39;ve never seen before they&amp;#39;re up</text>
  <text start="435.729" dur="3.75">by six point one nine percent now</text>
  <text start="437.169" dur="5.041">remember in the 20 cities they can</text>
  <text start="439.479" dur="5.311">control what is going on they can keep</text>
  <text start="442.21" dur="4.2">houses off the market and again this</text>
  <text start="444.79" dur="3.36">doesn&amp;#39;t apply to the rest of the country</text>
  <text start="446.41" dur="3.3">the only can control certain number of</text>
  <text start="448.15" dur="4.45">cities and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="449.71" dur="4.6">in all of these cities like Boston</text>
  <text start="452.6" dur="4.05">like we&amp;#39;re seeing in Seattle we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="454.31" dur="5.52">seeing that the housing bubble housing</text>
  <text start="456.65" dur="5.82">bubble number two is way above housing</text>
  <text start="459.83" dur="5.33">bubble number one now in Boston it&amp;#39;s 13</text>
  <text start="462.47" dur="6.39">percent higher than the housing bubble</text>
  <text start="465.16" dur="7.09">back in 2007 going into 2008 in Seattle</text>
  <text start="468.86" dur="7.23">it&amp;#39;s 20 percent higher than it was back</text>
  <text start="472.25" dur="6.84">in 2007-2008 Denver it&amp;#39;s 44 percent</text>
  <text start="476.09" dur="8.22">higher Dallas it&amp;#39;s 42 percent higher</text>
  <text start="479.09" dur="8.55">Atlanta 2.7 percent higher Portland 20%</text>
  <text start="484.31" dur="6.93">higher San Francisco 27 percent higher</text>
  <text start="487.64" dur="5.94">New York 19 percent higher and what</text>
  <text start="491.24" dur="8.06">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that this</text>
  <text start="493.58" dur="9">housing bubble 22.0 is gigantic and</text>
  <text start="499.3" dur="5.32">again when it comes crashing down and we</text>
  <text start="502.58" dur="4.26">can see across America outside of these</text>
  <text start="504.62" dur="4.29">20 cities there are people that are</text>
  <text start="506.84" dur="4.2">sitting on their homes the value of the</text>
  <text start="508.91" dur="4.439">homes are decreasing it&amp;#39;s getting harder</text>
  <text start="511.04" dur="5.49">to sell the houses and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="513.349" dur="5.13">keep this together as best they can in</text>
  <text start="516.53" dur="3.09">the Central Bank&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="518.479" dur="2.911">to do is they&amp;#39;re trying to keep all this</text>
  <text start="519.62" dur="3.93">together because they know if this whole</text>
  <text start="521.39" dur="4.23">thing falls apart it&amp;#39;s on their watch</text>
  <text start="523.55" dur="4.68">this is why they&amp;#39;re trying to create</text>
  <text start="525.62" dur="5.91">some type of distraction we see that</text>
  <text start="528.23" dur="7.65">wholesale inventories well they plunged</text>
  <text start="531.53" dur="7.29">in October by 0.4 percent and this was</text>
  <text start="535.88" dur="5.55">absolutely awful and we&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="538.82" dur="5.07">going to see a drop in GDP now these GDP</text>
  <text start="541.43" dur="5.22">numbers as we know they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="543.89" dur="4.5">manipulated and even though they come</text>
  <text start="546.65" dur="3.3">out with a three percent or two point</text>
  <text start="548.39" dur="3.33">nine percent when you strip away</text>
  <text start="549.95" dur="3.72">everything else on all the manipulation</text>
  <text start="551.72" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;re really looking at a one point two</text>
  <text start="553.67" dur="4.86">percent a one point three percent if you</text>
  <text start="555.92" dur="4.05">look at John Williams and shadow stat</text>
  <text start="558.53" dur="3.72">when he&amp;#39;s using the calculation going</text>
  <text start="559.97" dur="4.74">back a couple years we&amp;#39;re looking at GDP</text>
  <text start="562.25" dur="4.95">numbers in the negative range and that</text>
  <text start="564.71" dur="5.04">tells us something that all of this had</text>
  <text start="567.2" dur="4.89">to be manipulated just to convince you</text>
  <text start="569.75" dur="4.8">that the economy&amp;#39;s doing well now we</text>
  <text start="572.09" dur="4.08">know that the banks went through all</text>
  <text start="574.55" dur="3.57">these different stress tests we know</text>
  <text start="576.17" dur="3.63">that Europe had their stress test the</text>
  <text start="578.12" dur="4.56">Fed had the stress test here in the</text>
  <text start="579.8" dur="4.35">United States and we know right now</text>
  <text start="582.68" dur="3.57">because been looking at all the European</text>
  <text start="584.15" dur="4.29">banks many of them are in saw</text>
  <text start="586.25" dur="4.43">many of them are in trouble many of them</text>
  <text start="588.44" dur="6.03">have a lot of non-performing loans that</text>
  <text start="590.68" dur="6.61">exceed tangible capital and the ratios</text>
  <text start="594.47" dur="4.32">are above 100% and when we look at Italy</text>
  <text start="597.29" dur="3.33">we can see there&amp;#39;s about a hundred and</text>
  <text start="598.79" dur="3.9">fourteen Italian banks that have</text>
  <text start="600.62" dur="5.33">non-performing loans that exceed</text>
  <text start="602.69" dur="6.72">tangible capital the ratios are above</text>
  <text start="605.95" dur="6.58">100% now when we look at this there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="609.41" dur="5.37">little gauge called the Texas ratio and</text>
  <text start="612.53" dur="5.85">it was developed by Gerard Cassidy and</text>
  <text start="614.78" dur="5.91">and others at RBC Capital Markets it is</text>
  <text start="618.38" dur="4.44">a cow it&amp;#39;s calculated by dividing the</text>
  <text start="620.69" dur="6.06">value of the lenders non-performing</text>
  <text start="622.82" dur="5.73">assets by the sum of its tangible common</text>
  <text start="626.75" dur="5.55">equity capital and loan loss reserves</text>
  <text start="628.55" dur="7.74">and basically what they&amp;#39;re saying is if</text>
  <text start="632.3" dur="6.3">the number is above 100% the bank is in</text>
  <text start="636.29" dur="4.59">trouble now if we look we can see that</text>
  <text start="638.6" dur="4.35">in Italy there is about twenty four</text>
  <text start="640.88" dur="5.3">banks where there non-performing loans</text>
  <text start="642.95" dur="5.36">total two-hundred percent or more and</text>
  <text start="646.18" dur="4.99">when we look at this we can see that</text>
  <text start="648.31" dur="5.05">they are in big big trouble and this is</text>
  <text start="651.17" dur="3.27">going to spread to other banks because</text>
  <text start="653.36" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re all interconnected with</text>
  <text start="654.44" dur="6.09">derivatives now if we go back in time</text>
  <text start="657.2" dur="6.12">and we check out the Texas ratio and see</text>
  <text start="660.53" dur="6.63">how it performed during the 80s during</text>
  <text start="663.32" dur="6.48">the 90s we can see that banks tended to</text>
  <text start="667.16" dur="6.36">fail when the ratio reached one-to-one</text>
  <text start="669.8" dur="6.03">or 100% and if we go back to 1980 we can</text>
  <text start="673.52" dur="5.37">see the yes the banks reach this and</text>
  <text start="675.83" dur="5.79">they fail to go back to the 1990s guess</text>
  <text start="678.89" dur="5.34">what the banks failed because they</text>
  <text start="681.62" dur="4.86">reached this point and he&amp;#39;s out there</text>
  <text start="684.23" dur="3.54">saying that yes we can see this all</text>
  <text start="686.48" dur="3.45">throughout the United States throughout</text>
  <text start="687.77" dur="5.64">Europe that there&amp;#39;s many banks that have</text>
  <text start="689.93" dur="6.36">reached this percentage and they&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="693.41" dur="5.91">the cusp of completely imploding and</text>
  <text start="696.29" dur="6.75">it&amp;#39;s not just in Italy it&amp;#39;s in Spain</text>
  <text start="699.32" dur="5.88">it&amp;#39;s in France it&amp;#39;s in Germany it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="703.04" dur="4.2">the United States and all these banks</text>
  <text start="705.2" dur="4.38">once again are interconnected which</text>
  <text start="707.24" dur="5.31">tells us that we&amp;#39;re headed for this</text>
  <text start="709.58" dur="4.32">great disaster and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="712.55" dur="4.35">central bankers they&amp;#39;ve been preparing</text>
  <text start="713.9" dur="5.46">getting ready for this brand-new system</text>
  <text start="716.9" dur="3.24">we see the bricks they&amp;#39;re establishing</text>
  <text start="719.36" dur="3.33">their own</text>
  <text start="720.14" dur="4.41">gold trading system they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="722.69" dur="4.26">re-evaluate and create a new benchmark</text>
  <text start="724.55" dur="4.76">for gold we can see already that the</text>
  <text start="726.95" dur="4.86">payment system is out in China</text>
  <text start="729.31" dur="4.66">Manufacturing is out in China there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="731.81" dur="3.959">already a petrol yuyuan so when we look</text>
  <text start="733.97" dur="4.32">at this we can see slowly but surely</text>
  <text start="735.769" dur="4.411">doesn&amp;#39;t happen overnight they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="738.29" dur="4.859">planning this for quite a while it took</text>
  <text start="740.18" dur="5.04">them many many years to move everything</text>
  <text start="743.149" dur="4.711">out of the United States and to</text>
  <text start="745.22" dur="5.85">establish it someplace else like China</text>
  <text start="747.86" dur="6.63">Russia and they&amp;#39;re continually doing</text>
  <text start="751.07" dur="4.889">doing this and they haven&amp;#39;t stopped this</text>
  <text start="754.49" dur="4.17">is why you need to be ready and prepared</text>
  <text start="755.959" dur="5.911">you can see from the slamming down of</text>
  <text start="758.66" dur="5.7">the gold and silver prices they are very</text>
  <text start="761.87" dur="6">worried about what is about to happen</text>
  <text start="764.36" dur="8.099">because I think once this breaks once</text>
  <text start="767.87" dur="7.589">the system breaks down we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="772.459" dur="5.31">gold and silver shoot up just like the</text>
  <text start="775.459" dur="4.201">crypto currencies where the central</text>
  <text start="777.769" dur="4.681">bank&amp;#39;s can&amp;#39;t control it it&amp;#39;s like the</text>
  <text start="779.66" dur="5.039">Wild West and people are putting their</text>
  <text start="782.45" dur="4.35">funds into this because this is a free</text>
  <text start="784.699" dur="4.411">and open market it&amp;#39;s not centralized</text>
  <text start="786.8" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s decentralized and they realize that</text>
  <text start="789.11" dur="3.719">no one is really controlling this</text>
  <text start="791.06" dur="4.469">compared to the precious metal precious</text>
  <text start="792.829" dur="4.531">metals market where the central bank the</text>
  <text start="795.529" dur="3.3">bank&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re controlling everything</text>
  <text start="797.36" dur="4.2">the stock market they&amp;#39;re controlling</text>
  <text start="798.829" dur="6.331">that they control the currencies of the</text>
  <text start="801.56" dur="5.73">world and once the precious metals</text>
  <text start="805.16" dur="5.039">market breaks free and it will break</text>
  <text start="807.29" dur="5.909">free we&amp;#39;re gonna see gold and silver</text>
  <text start="810.199" dur="5.401">completely shoot up most likely almost</text>
  <text start="813.199" dur="4.38">like crypto currencies because if you</text>
  <text start="815.6" dur="5.16">take the calculations going all the way</text>
  <text start="817.579" dur="5.671">back prior to the Great Depression gold</text>
  <text start="820.76" dur="4.8">and silver right now should be someplace</text>
  <text start="823.25" dur="4.56">between seven and eight thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="825.56" dur="4.74">for gold and four and five hundred</text>
  <text start="827.81" dur="3.81">dollars around four for silver and we</text>
  <text start="830.3" dur="3.36">can see that this number could be even</text>
  <text start="831.62" dur="3.6">higher because of what is happening</text>
  <text start="833.66" dur="4.08">around the world and how people are</text>
  <text start="835.22" dur="4.859">trying to protect their wealth so you</text>
  <text start="837.74" dur="4.08">need to get prepared because everyone</text>
  <text start="840.079" dur="4.711">when I say everyone I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="841.82" dur="5.699">the central banks the banking system the</text>
  <text start="844.79" dur="6.09">establishment they&amp;#39;re getting prepared</text>
  <text start="847.519" dur="5.911">and ready to move this to a new system</text>
  <text start="850.88" dur="2.819">and you want to weather the storm you</text>
  <text start="853.43" dur="1.769">want</text>
  <text start="853.699" dur="3.24">dollarz you want to have cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="855.199" dur="4.11">you went up gold and silver you wanna</text>
  <text start="856.939" dur="4.83">have food supplies water because when</text>
  <text start="859.309" dur="5.13">this does happen you&amp;#39;re going to need</text>
  <text start="861.769" dur="4.5">all of this and when is it going to</text>
  <text start="864.439" dur="3.601">happen well it could happen tomorrow</text>
