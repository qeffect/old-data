  <text start="42.46" dur="6.9">is ticking down indicators are on track</text>
  <text start="46.379" dur="6.191">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="49.36" dur="5.43">political and geopolitical news now we</text>
  <text start="52.57" dur="3.9">know the government and many of its</text>
  <text start="54.79" dur="2.97">agencies they&amp;#39;ve been spying on the</text>
  <text start="56.47" dur="3.119">American people and we discussed many</text>
  <text start="57.76" dur="3.869">many times before why they are doing</text>
  <text start="59.589" dur="3.96">this and the reason why they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="61.629" dur="5.161">this because the people are a threat to</text>
  <text start="63.549" dur="6.511">their authority but during a PBS town</text>
  <text start="66.79" dur="5.46">hall meeting Obama was asked why he and</text>
  <text start="70.06" dur="4.5">Hillary want to control and restrict</text>
  <text start="72.25" dur="7.159">guns and ammunition to responsible gun</text>
  <text start="74.56" dur="8.16">owners and during this town hall meeting</text>
  <text start="79.409" dur="5.561">he went on about why they have to you</text>
  <text start="82.72" dur="4.41">know do this with weapons and why we</text>
  <text start="84.97" dur="4.53">need to control it but we don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="87.13" dur="7.169">take it away and like I said whatever he</text>
  <text start="89.5" dur="7.53">says is always the opposite but he went</text>
  <text start="94.299" dur="6.481">on to say that he just came from a</text>
  <text start="97.03" dur="6.6">meeting in this situation room in which</text>
  <text start="100.78" dur="5.24">I&amp;#39;ve I which I got people who we know</text>
  <text start="103.63" dur="5.279">have been on the Islamic state websites</text>
  <text start="106.02" dur="5.68">living here in the United States US</text>
  <text start="108.909" dur="4.89">citizens and we&amp;#39;re allowed to put them</text>
  <text start="111.7" dur="4.379">on the no-fly list when it comes to</text>
  <text start="113.799" dur="4.411">Airlines but because of the National</text>
  <text start="116.079" dur="5.04">Rifle Association I cannot prohibit</text>
  <text start="118.21" dur="4.409">those people from buying guns well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="121.119" dur="3.331">not because of the NRA it&amp;#39;s because of</text>
  <text start="122.619" dur="4.32">the Second Amendment and second of all</text>
  <text start="124.45" dur="4.5">you cannot put people on the no-fly list</text>
  <text start="126.939" dur="5.281">because they have the right to travel</text>
  <text start="128.95" dur="5.7">these people haven&amp;#39;t done anything wrong</text>
  <text start="132.22" dur="4.32">can you imagine if you just looked at</text>
  <text start="134.65" dur="4.919">something and they said ah you&amp;#39;re guilty</text>
  <text start="136.54" dur="6.39">that&amp;#39;s what the government is doing now</text>
  <text start="139.569" dur="5.881">the president confirmed that someone</text>
  <text start="142.93" dur="6.27">from the government is noting everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="145.45" dur="7.88">browser history determining which</text>
  <text start="149.2" dur="6.9">websites are not to be visited and</text>
  <text start="153.33" dur="5.26">furthermore if someone does visit the</text>
  <text start="156.1" dur="5.73">website for whatever reason they get put</text>
  <text start="158.59" dur="5.81">on the no-fly list so he confirmed that</text>
  <text start="161.83" dur="8.329">they&amp;#39;re tracking and watching</text>
  <text start="164.4" dur="8.199">now first of all what are these websites</text>
  <text start="170.159" dur="5.14">why don&amp;#39;t you have the freedom to look</text>
  <text start="172.599" dur="4.291">at whatever you want and what is it the</text>
  <text start="175.299" dur="6.391">government&amp;#39;s business if you haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="176.89" dur="7.26">done anything and do they have a warrant</text>
  <text start="181.69" dur="6.269">to surveil what websites people are</text>
  <text start="184.15" dur="6.8">visiting is there any oversight about</text>
  <text start="187.959" dur="5.25">what is going on here and of course the</text>
  <text start="190.95" dur="5.47">the answer to all these questions is</text>
  <text start="193.209" dur="6.181">most likely no so they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="196.42" dur="5.73">every single person very very closely we</text>
  <text start="199.39" dur="3.84">know the Islamic state is a proxy force</text>
  <text start="202.15" dur="4.1">which is created by the US government</text>
  <text start="203.23" dur="5.399">central bankers and they keep telling us</text>
  <text start="206.25" dur="4.51">how people are looking and how people</text>
  <text start="208.629" dur="5.041">are you know going to these sites and</text>
  <text start="210.76" dur="5.46">how people are on social media well just</text>
  <text start="213.67" dur="4.95">because you look and you want to see</text>
  <text start="216.22" dur="6.299">doesn&amp;#39;t mean you&amp;#39;re guilty of something</text>
  <text start="218.62" dur="7.44">and I thought in the u.s. in this</text>
  <text start="222.519" dur="6.33">country you were innocent until proven</text>
  <text start="226.06" dur="10.44">guilty of something looking at something</text>
  <text start="228.849" dur="10.79">is not proving someone as guilty so we</text>
  <text start="236.5" dur="6.739">have a problem here with our government</text>
  <text start="239.639" dur="7.121">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince everyone that</text>
  <text start="243.239" dur="6.43">they have the authority to look at our</text>
  <text start="246.76" dur="5.729">information they have the authority to</text>
  <text start="249.669" dur="5.04">put you on a list just because you</text>
  <text start="252.489" dur="6.421">looked at something they have the</text>
  <text start="254.709" dur="6.361">authority to maybe stop you from buying</text>
  <text start="258.91" dur="6.06">a weapon because you looked at something</text>
  <text start="261.07" dur="9">this is where he&amp;#39;s going with this out</text>
  <text start="264.97" dur="8.04">in the UK we see mi5 they were both</text>
  <text start="270.07" dur="6.9">collecting the public&amp;#39;s data with no</text>
  <text start="273.01" dur="5.969">oversight and we see that mi5 was</text>
  <text start="276.97" dur="3.689">allowed to escape regular scrutiny of</text>
  <text start="278.979" dur="4.171">its bulk collection of communications</text>
  <text start="280.659" dur="4.651">data by the watchdog charged with</text>
  <text start="283.15" dur="3.449">overseeing it this is coming from a</text>
  <text start="285.31" dur="5.18">newly released confidential</text>
  <text start="286.599" dur="7.741">correspondent the privacy international</text>
  <text start="290.49" dur="6.669">has released documents the documents</text>
  <text start="294.34" dur="3.81">detail that all of this was carried out</text>
  <text start="297.159" dur="2.941">in 2004</text>
  <text start="298.15" dur="3.38">war between the Home Office and the</text>
  <text start="300.1" dur="5.64">government communications headquarters</text>
  <text start="301.53" dur="5.59">with Sir Swinton Thomas the interception</text>
  <text start="305.74" dur="5.61">of communication commissioner at the</text>
  <text start="307.12" dur="8.91">time and we see at this point many of</text>
  <text start="311.35" dur="6.74">the countries are doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="316.03" dur="5.49">want and violating the people&amp;#39;s rights</text>
  <text start="318.09" dur="10.36">without getting warrants without having</text>
  <text start="321.52" dur="9.66">oversight without anything and we see at</text>
  <text start="328.45" dur="5.88">this point most of the governments</text>
  <text start="331.18" dur="6.36">around the world it&amp;#39;s time for them to</text>
  <text start="334.33" dur="9.21">be removed and it&amp;#39;s time for people to</text>
  <text start="337.54" dur="8.91">replace our career politicians with real</text>
  <text start="343.54" dur="4.71">people that have real jobs that care</text>
  <text start="346.45" dur="4.5">about the people and it&amp;#39;s time to get</text>
  <text start="348.25" dur="5.51">rid of the central bank this is what</text>
  <text start="350.95" dur="5.4">it&amp;#39;s all coming down to here because</text>
  <text start="353.76" dur="5.88">government&amp;#39;s today are completely out of</text>
  <text start="356.35" dur="7.52">control completely out of touch with the</text>
  <text start="359.64" dur="7.9">people because they&amp;#39;ve been bribed</text>
  <text start="363.87" dur="6.34">they&amp;#39;ve been blackmailed they work for</text>
  <text start="367.54" dur="4.56">foreign governments they work for the</text>
  <text start="370.21" dur="7.23">central bank they work for corporations</text>
  <text start="372.1" dur="6.6">and they want to keep their power you</text>
  <text start="377.44" dur="4.43">have to remember when the country was</text>
  <text start="378.7" dur="7.89">founded there was no such thing as a</text>
  <text start="381.87" dur="7.72">career politician they didn&amp;#39;t get paid</text>
  <text start="386.59" dur="7.95">this enormous salary they didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="389.59" dur="8.73">pensions and medical benefits they were</text>
  <text start="394.54" dur="6.69">there voluntarily because they wanted to</text>
  <text start="398.32" dur="5.43">make the country better they kept their</text>
  <text start="401.23" dur="9.02">other jobs they went back to their other</text>
  <text start="403.75" dur="9.06">jobs after their term was over but today</text>
  <text start="410.25" dur="6.84">none of these people actually had jobs</text>
  <text start="412.81" dur="8.19">most of them they came out of school</text>
  <text start="417.09" dur="6.46">they went right into politics people</text>
  <text start="421" dur="4.26">padded i should say company&amp;#39;s central</text>
  <text start="423.55" dur="6.06">banks governments padded their pockets</text>
  <text start="425.26" dur="6.24">with currency and they lost all touch</text>
  <text start="429.61" dur="6.92">with everything else</text>
  <text start="431.5" dur="8.13">and they wanted more and more and more</text>
  <text start="436.53" dur="7.03">well it&amp;#39;s time to end all of this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="439.63" dur="6.18">time to take the u.s. back it&amp;#39;s time for</text>
  <text start="443.56" dur="8.82">people in other countries to take their</text>
  <text start="445.81" dur="11.67">countries back now out in Ukraine we see</text>
  <text start="452.38" dur="6.78">that Lavrov realizes what&amp;#39;s going on in</text>
  <text start="457.48" dur="4.77">Ukraine and he&amp;#39;s finally out there</text>
  <text start="459.16" dur="5.4">saying it that Ukrainian authorities are</text>
  <text start="462.25" dur="5.55">not ready to make progress on any of the</text>
  <text start="464.56" dur="6.99">Mint&amp;#39;s two provisions that have to be</text>
  <text start="467.8" dur="6.81">coordinated with the Dom bossun and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="471.55" dur="6.57">saying that everything in the mins to</text>
  <text start="474.61" dur="5.94">needs to be coordinated with the Lugansk</text>
  <text start="478.12" dur="5.549">and the Donetsk areas between Kiev and</text>
  <text start="480.55" dur="5.43">those areas and unfortunately the</text>
  <text start="483.669" dur="4.471">Ukrainian authorities they&amp;#39;re not ready</text>
  <text start="485.98" dur="3.96">to make any progress and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="488.14" dur="3.96">ready to push the mints to cease fire</text>
  <text start="489.94" dur="5.09">forward what they&amp;#39;re really doing is</text>
  <text start="492.1" dur="5.04">stalling and this is very noticeable</text>
  <text start="495.03" dur="5.139">when they were sitting at the Normandy</text>
  <text start="497.14" dur="6.06">format and they&amp;#39;re realizing that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="500.169" dur="5.31">going nowhere so what exactly are they</text>
  <text start="503.2" dur="5.91">trying to do well they&amp;#39;re never going to</text>
  <text start="505.479" dur="5.851">give in on the mints to cease fire we</text>
  <text start="509.11" dur="5.9">see things are building up in the</text>
  <text start="511.33" dur="6.06">eastern area with more and more drills</text>
  <text start="515.01" dur="4.75">more and more military assets being</text>
  <text start="517.39" dur="4.68">brought into that region more troops</text>
  <text start="519.76" dur="5.43">being brought right up to the border of</text>
  <text start="522.07" dur="6.75">Russia we see this more shelling going</text>
  <text start="525.19" dur="5.37">on in Donetsk and Lugansk trying to</text>
  <text start="528.82" dur="6.3">provoke the region into doing something</text>
  <text start="530.56" dur="7.47">and we see that for the last many months</text>
  <text start="535.12" dur="5.01">the US UK and other nations have been in</text>
  <text start="538.03" dur="5.72">there providing them with military</text>
  <text start="540.13" dur="5.79">assets and training their forces and</text>
  <text start="543.75" dur="4.839">when we look at all these indicators</text>
  <text start="545.92" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;re getting ready and</text>
  <text start="548.589" dur="5.101">prepared for something much much bigger</text>
  <text start="550.51" dur="7.32">down the line we know that Ukraine is</text>
  <text start="553.69" dur="6.18">now in league with NATO so when we start</text>
  <text start="557.83" dur="3.48">putting these pieces together we start</text>
  <text start="559.87" dur="4.95">to see the picture we start to see</text>
  <text start="561.31" dur="3.95">what&amp;#39;s going on here President Obama he</text>
  <text start="564.82" dur="2.96">is</text>
  <text start="565.26" dur="6.26">be going out to Warsaw next month to</text>
  <text start="567.78" dur="6.59">discuss economic issues and</text>
  <text start="571.52" dur="7.18">international security challenges and</text>
  <text start="574.37" dur="5.5">he&amp;#39;s going to meet with Donald Tusk and</text>
  <text start="578.7" dur="5.25">the European Commission President</text>
  <text start="579.87" dur="5.67">jean-claude Juncker and on the sidelines</text>
  <text start="583.95" dur="3.99">he&amp;#39;s going to be talking to the NATO</text>
  <text start="585.54" dur="5.46">summit in the post capital between july</text>
  <text start="587.94" dur="4.5">eighth and ninth to make sure make sure</text>
  <text start="591" dur="4.34">everything is coordinated for what is</text>
  <text start="592.44" dur="4.83">coming up most likely in august and</text>
  <text start="595.34" dur="4.6">these are the things that we need to</text>
  <text start="597.27" dur="6.15">continually watch we see iron wolf which</text>
  <text start="599.94" dur="6.45">is a NATO drill in Lithuania 5,000</text>
  <text start="603.42" dur="4.92">people are taking part in this and we</text>
  <text start="606.39" dur="4.62">see that Germany Denmark France</text>
  <text start="608.34" dur="5.55">Luxembourg they are going to be joining</text>
  <text start="611.01" dur="4.8">the second phase on jun 12 we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="613.89" dur="4.95">French troops they are going to be there</text>
  <text start="615.81" dur="6.59">also and of course poulan and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="618.84" dur="5.46">continually doing this provoking Russia</text>
  <text start="622.4" dur="5.38">because they&amp;#39;re doing all of these</text>
  <text start="624.3" dur="6.15">things right on the border i&amp;#39;m russia</text>
  <text start="627.78" dur="4.83">and if you notice it&amp;#39;s a poke it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="630.45" dur="4.41">poke and another poke and they&amp;#39;re hoping</text>
  <text start="632.61" dur="3.63">that Russia will do something but at</text>
  <text start="634.86" dur="4.14">this point we can see the actions of</text>
  <text start="636.24" dur="5.34">Russia Russia is not falling into this</text>
  <text start="639" dur="5.58">trap they realize what the US is doing</text>
  <text start="641.58" dur="5.52">and they&amp;#39;ve been holding back quite a</text>
  <text start="644.58" dur="4.95">bit and this is why the u.s. continually</text>
  <text start="647.1" dur="4.74">moves their sights to different</text>
  <text start="649.53" dur="4.23">locations like China hoping to do</text>
  <text start="651.84" dur="4.86">something there in the Pacific or maybe</text>
  <text start="653.76" dur="6.15">to North Korea because that might be a</text>
  <text start="656.7" dur="6.51">better chance for something to occur now</text>
  <text start="659.91" dur="5.58">a couple days ago the German parliament</text>
  <text start="663.21" dur="5.25">adopted a bill recognizing the mass</text>
  <text start="665.49" dur="7.29">killings of Armenians by the Ottoman</text>
  <text start="668.46" dur="11.78">authorities in 1915 as genocide and this</text>
  <text start="672.78" dur="11.58">was put into place most likely to</text>
  <text start="680.24" dur="6.94">blackmail turkey because what we are</text>
  <text start="684.36" dur="4.92">seeing right now Turkey was putting</text>
  <text start="687.18" dur="4.29">pressure on the European Union</text>
  <text start="689.28" dur="6.6">especially Germany about the refugee</text>
  <text start="691.47" dur="5.73">situation germany at this point looks</text>
  <text start="695.88" dur="3.39">like they&amp;#39;re fighting back and saying</text>
  <text start="697.2" dur="4.14">okay you want to play this game</text>
  <text start="699.27" dur="7.86">then we&amp;#39;re going to make it official</text>
  <text start="701.34" dur="7.98">that this was genocide now of course</text>
  <text start="707.13" dur="6.39">irda want is very upset about this and</text>
  <text start="709.32" dur="8.69">he says that they&amp;#39;ll never recognize the</text>
  <text start="713.52" dur="6.9">armenian genocide and he is saying that</text>
  <text start="718.01" dur="5.08">okay it looks like you&amp;#39;re blackmailing</text>
  <text start="720.42" dur="5.19">us well this is exactly what he was</text>
  <text start="723.09" dur="5.04">doing with the European Union and</text>
  <text start="725.61" dur="5.55">Germany so they&amp;#39;re both playing the game</text>
  <text start="728.13" dur="6.87">at this point and using whatever they</text>
  <text start="731.16" dur="5.4">possibly can to get each other to do</text>
  <text start="735" dur="5.34">things the other country really doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="736.56" dur="6.09">want to do now turkey once the European</text>
  <text start="740.34" dur="6.57">Union and Germany and the rest of the</text>
  <text start="742.65" dur="6.99">nation&amp;#39;s to pay turkey for not releasing</text>
  <text start="746.91" dur="5.52">the refugees and they want billions of</text>
  <text start="749.64" dur="4.95">dollars while the European Union Germany</text>
  <text start="752.43" dur="5.4">they don&amp;#39;t want to do this they want</text>

  <text start="761.34" dur="6.45">where we can stop this from happening</text>

  <text start="942.389" dur="4.981">know they&amp;#39;ve been bringing in a lot of</text>
  <text start="944.16" dur="5.849">military assets to this region this is</text>
  <text start="947.37" dur="3.839">all in preparation for most likely what</text>
  <text start="950.009" dur="3.63">is coming in August because all</text>
  <text start="951.209" dur="4.411">indicators right now are still on track</text>
  <text start="953.639" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re pointing to what is about to</text>
  <text start="955.62" dur="4.829">happen we know we have one aircraft</text>
  <text start="958.199" dur="6.33">carrier in the Mediterranean another one</text>
  <text start="960.449" dur="6.541">is on its way and we see there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="964.529" dur="6.451">going on in this area</text>
  <text start="966.99" dur="10.77">we see the UK they have their teams on</text>
  <text start="970.98" dur="9.44">the front line in Syria fighting at the</text>
  <text start="977.76" dur="6">same exact time now a lot of the</text>
  <text start="980.42" dur="7.15">European countries do have special op</text>
  <text start="983.76" dur="5.37">teams in Syria fighting I know it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="987.57" dur="4.11">reported out there in the corporate</text>
  <text start="989.13" dur="4.47">media well most likely they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="991.68" dur="3.42">to report it just yet this is just</text>
  <text start="993.6" dur="5.91">coming out but we can see behind the</text>
  <text start="995.1" dur="6.72">scenes we&amp;#39;re seeing the u.s. the UK and</text>
  <text start="999.51" dur="5.16">the coalition forces they&amp;#39;re all out</text>
  <text start="1001.82" dur="7.019">there directing the terrace on what to</text>
  <text start="1004.67" dur="6.63">do and the reason for all this is</text>
  <text start="1008.839" dur="4.56">because they&amp;#39;re getting ready for what</text>
  <text start="1011.3" dur="3.06">is coming and we know what&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="1013.399" dur="3">because we&amp;#39;ve been looking at the</text>
  <text start="1014.36" dur="4.74">economic indicators we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="1016.399" dur="5.221">what has been going on and everything is</text>
  <text start="1019.1" dur="5.7">still ago nothing has changed as of yet</text>
  <text start="1021.62" dur="6.449">now people right in saying you know is</text>
  <text start="1024.8" dur="5.039">this going to happen definitely can</text>
  <text start="1028.069" dur="4.831">anything change well yes anything can</text>
  <text start="1029.839" dur="5.281">change look back in 2013 the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1032.9" dur="4.439">brought in all the warships into the</text>
  <text start="1035.12" dur="5.689">Mediterranean they were ready to go into</text>
  <text start="1037.339" dur="6.84">Syria with the sarin gas false flag and</text>
  <text start="1040.809" dur="6.161">Russia brokered a peace deal the US</text>
  <text start="1044.179" dur="4.171">couldn&amp;#39;t get any traction from Congress</text>
  <text start="1046.97" dur="5.6">they couldn&amp;#39;t get any traction from the</text>
  <text start="1048.35" dur="7.56">US from the American people to go into</text>
  <text start="1052.57" dur="8.489">Syria and to invade so they had a back</text>
  <text start="1055.91" dur="8.16">off of it and we see at this point that</text>
  <text start="1061.059" dur="5.951">anything could happen but right now the</text>
  <text start="1064.07" dur="6.72">indicators the set up for what is coming</text>
  <text start="1067.01" dur="5.79">is completely on track and ready to go</text>
  <text start="1070.79" dur="4.65">and we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch the</text>
  <text start="1072.8" dur="5.009">situation very closely as we approach</text>
  <text start="1075.44" dur="4.86">the july month and especially to the end</text>
  <text start="1077.809" dur="6.061">of july because we should see things</text>
  <text start="1080.3" dur="6.99">accelerate and we should see certain</text>
  <text start="1083.87" dur="6.59">things evolve during this period where</text>
  <text start="1087.29" dur="5.88">we see more troops where we see more</text>
  <text start="1090.46" dur="5.17">countries admitting they have troops on</text>
  <text start="1093.17" dur="4.56">the front lines will we see more</text>
  <text start="1095.63" dur="5.17">military assets from the United States</text>
  <text start="1097.73" dur="6">appear in Syria</text>
  <text start="1100.8" dur="5.97">we see planes flying into the bases in</text>
  <text start="1103.73" dur="5.86">Syria bringing in more troops bringing</text>
  <text start="1106.77" dur="4.29">in more military assets these are all</text>
  <text start="1109.59" dur="3.3">the different signs as many more than</text>
  <text start="1111.06" dur="3.96">this but these are all the things we</text>
  <text start="1112.89" dur="4.53">need to start looking at and watching</text>
  <text start="1115.02" dur="6.3">very carefully because if we see this</text>
  <text start="1117.42" dur="5.88">happening in July going into August we</text>
  <text start="1121.32" dur="4.98">will then see something occur and</text>
  <text start="1123.3" dur="4.83">eventually most likely to kick this off</text>
  <text start="1126.3" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re going to have some type of an</text>
  <text start="1128.13" dur="3.63">event now what is that event we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1129.99" dur="3.69">know for sure what it&amp;#39;s going to be but</text>
  <text start="1131.76" dur="4.92">we know there&amp;#39;s a travel advisory</text>
  <text start="1133.68" dur="6.15">throughout Europe about some type of</text>
  <text start="1136.68" dur="6.75">Islamic state or terrorist action that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1139.83" dur="6.72">going to hit somewhere we know it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="1143.43" dur="6.03">in Africa it could happen in the United</text>
  <text start="1146.55" dur="3.9">States but these are all the indicators</text>
  <text start="1149.46" dur="2.57">and everything that we&amp;#39;ve been watching</text>
  <text start="1150.45" dur="6.87">that we need to continually watch and</text>
  <text start="1152.03" dur="8.86">make sure we understand now there was a</text>
  <text start="1157.32" dur="6.39">very interesting op-ed article in The</text>
  <text start="1160.89" dur="8.22">New York Times about the new vision of</text>
  <text start="1163.71" dur="8.16">America and how the federal government</text>
  <text start="1169.11" dur="8.94">is very small now and it needs to grow</text>
  <text start="1171.87" dur="9.9">larger and they were talking about the</text>
  <text start="1178.05" dur="5.99">states the state&amp;#39;s sovereignty and they</text>
  <text start="1181.77" dur="5.43">were suggesting the dissolution of the</text>
  <text start="1184.04" dur="6.55">states because of an antiquated</text>
  <text start="1187.2" dur="7.23">political structure of the 50 distinct</text>
  <text start="1190.59" dur="6.36">states which is holding back the grand</text>
  <text start="1194.43" dur="7.59">fantasy of the central planners in</text>
  <text start="1196.95" dur="9.21">Washington DC well we know what this is</text>
  <text start="1202.02" dur="7.53">all about they want control of the</text>
  <text start="1206.16" dur="4.89">entire country when I say they it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1209.55" dur="4.38">central bankers the US government the</text>
  <text start="1211.05" dur="5.1">elites they want control and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1213.93" dur="4.41">want the states to have the control</text>
  <text start="1216.15" dur="4.11">because when the country was found the</text>
  <text start="1218.34" dur="5.28">founding fathers actually really gave</text>
  <text start="1220.26" dur="4.47">the power to the States not to the</text>
  <text start="1223.62" dur="3.48">federal government the federal</text>
  <text start="1224.73" dur="5.76">government was the administrators that</text>
  <text start="1227.1" dur="6.66">carried out the orders of the states of</text>
  <text start="1230.49" dur="4.11">the people what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="1233.76" dur="4.169">here</text>
  <text start="1234.6" dur="6">is there trying to move the power to the</text>
  <text start="1237.929" dur="4.771">federal government and get rid of state</text>
  <text start="1240.6" dur="6.12">sovereignty and this is why they can</text>
  <text start="1242.7" dur="8.49">continually say antiquated or you know</text>
  <text start="1246.72" dur="8.37">it&amp;#39;s obsolete and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1251.19" dur="6.599">right now is their play to try to take</text>
  <text start="1255.09" dur="6">all the power at this point as the</text>
  <text start="1257.789" dur="6.661">system is coming down as everything is</text>
  <text start="1261.09" dur="7.5">collapsing they&amp;#39;ll be making their move</text>
  <text start="1264.45" dur="7.109">and this is exactly what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1268.59" dur="5.25">doing and if you look from everything</text>
  <text start="1271.559" dur="4.11">that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about taking</text>
  <text start="1273.84" dur="3.81">control and taking the power away from</text>
  <text start="1275.669" dur="5.671">education from the states did they do</text>
  <text start="1277.65" dur="5.61">that yes how&amp;#39;d they do that well all the</text>
  <text start="1281.34" dur="5.39">funding now comes from the federal</text>
  <text start="1283.26" dur="7.68">government they threaten schools now</text>
  <text start="1286.73" dur="7.809">with taking away the funding police</text>
  <text start="1290.94" dur="4.59">departments well they&amp;#39;re getting a lot</text>
  <text start="1294.539" dur="3.571">of their funding from the federal</text>
  <text start="1295.53" dur="6.62">government if you do not follow what we</text>
  <text start="1298.11" dur="6.99">do we will we will remove your funding</text>
  <text start="1302.15" dur="5.47">so you can see they&amp;#39;re already making a</text>
  <text start="1305.1" dur="4.23">play they&amp;#39;ve been doing this for quite a</text>
  <text start="1307.62" dur="4.53">while and like I said they do this very</text>
  <text start="1309.33" dur="4.89">slowly very methodically so no one</text>
  <text start="1312.15" dur="6.57">realizes what&amp;#39;s going on until it&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="1314.22" dur="6.87">late and as this system collapses their</text>
  <text start="1318.72" dur="4.77">play will be to try to take away the</text>
  <text start="1321.09" dur="6.78">rights to take away the sovereignty to</text>
  <text start="1323.49" dur="6.03">take full power of everything listen</text>
  <text start="1327.87" dur="4.08">everyone thanks a lot for listening be</text>
