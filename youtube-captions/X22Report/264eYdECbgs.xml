  <text start="132.9" dur="4.92">this more of this chaos this volatility</text>
  <text start="135.12" dur="5.369">as we move throughout this summer and</text>
  <text start="137.82" dur="5.22">into the fall and it&amp;#39;s going to get</text>
  <text start="140.489" dur="4.53">worse and worse as time goes on and we</text>
  <text start="143.04" dur="5.009">can see right now that we are headed</text>
  <text start="145.019" dur="4.261">towards this major correction that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="148.049" dur="3.811">what a lot of people like to call it</text>
  <text start="149.28" dur="4.769">it&amp;#39;s really a collapse of this fake</text>
  <text start="151.86" dur="4.05">economy let&amp;#39;s just call it what it is</text>
  <text start="154.049" dur="5.66">because a lot of the numbers right now</text>
  <text start="155.91" dur="6.69">are a complete illusion they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="159.709" dur="4.961">manipulated to create and paint the</text>
  <text start="162.6" dur="5.639">picture that this economy is doing well</text>
  <text start="164.67" dur="7.47">the san francisco fed right now is out</text>
  <text start="168.239" dur="8.571">there and they&amp;#39;re saying well the job</text>
  <text start="172.14" dur="7.23">market is not as strong as perceived and</text>
  <text start="176.81" dur="5.32">this is coming from the san francisco</text>
  <text start="179.37" dur="4.98">fed quote the labor market</text>
  <text start="182.13" dur="5.19">may not be as tight as the headline</text>
  <text start="184.35" dur="5.49">unemployment rate suggests really</text>
  <text start="187.32" dur="4.2">because we&amp;#39;ve been looking at the</text>
  <text start="189.84" dur="2.85">unemployment market we&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="191.52" dur="3.18">at the unemployment numbers we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="192.69" dur="3.84">looking at what is been going on and we</text>
  <text start="194.7" dur="4.32">know that the numbers are completely</text>
  <text start="196.53" dur="4.65">manipulated and they went on to say that</text>
  <text start="199.02" dur="5.19">between nineteen forty eight and twenty</text>
  <text start="201.18" dur="5.76">fifteen the work rate for us men 20 and</text>
  <text start="204.21" dur="5.58">older fell from eighty five point eight</text>
  <text start="206.94" dur="5.25">percent 268 point two percent the</text>
  <text start="209.79" dur="5.49">participation rate of female workers is</text>
  <text start="212.19" dur="6.12">beginning to decline as well the trend</text>
  <text start="215.28" dur="6.18">in the workplace has not been our friend</text>
  <text start="218.31" dur="6.66">and we know it&amp;#39;s not been our friend</text>
  <text start="221.46" dur="5.64">when we look at the actual calculations</text>
  <text start="224.97" dur="4.65">of unemployment going back in time</text>
  <text start="227.1" dur="4.86">forget about the manipulation we see</text>
  <text start="229.62" dur="4.44">unemployment right now above twenty</text>
  <text start="231.96" dur="4.29">three percent and this is according to</text>
  <text start="234.06" dur="4.71">shadow stats John Williams who&amp;#39;s taken</text>
  <text start="236.25" dur="4.86">that calculation and he&amp;#39;s using the old</text>
  <text start="238.77" dur="4.74">calculation and how they calculated</text>
  <text start="241.11" dur="4.68">unemployment today what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="243.51" dur="3.87">a if you haven&amp;#39;t been on an interview in</text>
  <text start="245.79" dur="3.03">four weeks we just don&amp;#39;t count you&amp;#39;re no</text>
  <text start="247.38" dur="4.17">longer we&amp;#39;re looking for a job you yay</text>
  <text start="248.82" dur="4.23">our people are still looking for jobs</text>
  <text start="251.55" dur="4.26">and when we look at what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="253.05" dur="5.01">around the country we see corporations</text>
  <text start="255.81" dur="5.28">stores they&amp;#39;re all closing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="258.06" dur="4.92">laying off individuals and jobs well</text>
  <text start="261.09" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re just not being created right now</text>
  <text start="262.98" dur="5.22">even though the corporate media the BLS</text>
  <text start="265.86" dur="6.09">numbers Trump keeps telling you the jobs</text>
  <text start="268.2" dur="6.36">are coming back not right now nothing</text>
  <text start="271.95" dur="5.58">has changed things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="274.56" dur="5.25">deteriorating but there is good news the</text>
  <text start="277.53" dur="5.22">too-big-to-fail banks well they just</text>
  <text start="279.81" dur="5.22">topped one trillion dollars for the</text>
  <text start="282.75" dur="4.53">first time ever the market cap of</text>
  <text start="285.03" dur="5.04">America&amp;#39;s big four banks top one</text>
  <text start="287.28" dur="5.73">trillion and they&amp;#39;ve been surging about</text>
  <text start="290.07" dur="6.18">thirty percent since Trump was elected</text>
  <text start="293.01" dur="6.12">now the last time the nation&amp;#39;s big four</text>
  <text start="296.25" dur="5.73">banks top one trillion and market cap it</text>
  <text start="299.13" dur="4.53">all didn&amp;#39;t end well and we know what</text>
  <text start="301.98" dur="3.57">happened back in two thousand eight and</text>
  <text start="303.66" dur="3.66">we can see right now from everything</text>
  <text start="305.55" dur="4.71">that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at from every</text>
  <text start="307.32" dur="4.92">single piece of economic data plowing</text>
  <text start="310.26" dur="3.9">through the stats and looking at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="312.24" dur="4.2">really going on we can see that the</text>
  <text start="314.16" dur="4.47">economy is deteriorating very</text>
  <text start="316.44" dur="4.77">very quickly at this point and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="318.63" dur="4.47">going to happen is the signal to let you</text>
  <text start="321.21" dur="4.5">know that the economy is not doing well</text>
  <text start="323.1" dur="4.17">well the market is all of a sudden going</text>
  <text start="325.71" dur="3.09">to come down and it&amp;#39;s going to come down</text>
  <text start="327.27" dur="3.51">hard and then people are going to say</text>
  <text start="328.8" dur="4.26">whoa hey we&amp;#39;re in a recession this is a</text>
  <text start="330.78" dur="4.23">surprise because we thought the economy</text>
  <text start="333.06" dur="4.68">with doing LA but remember the Fed</text>
  <text start="335.01" dur="5.55">already came out and they warned us that</text>
  <text start="337.74" dur="5.31">the economy isn&amp;#39;t doing as well as they</text>
  <text start="340.56" dur="4.76">thought they&amp;#39;re disappointed but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="343.05" dur="5.07">still raising rates into a weak economy</text>
  <text start="345.32" dur="5.17">Trump has already said the economy is a</text>
  <text start="348.12" dur="5.1">complete mess the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="350.49" dur="5.73">already saying that the economy seems to</text>
  <text start="353.22" dur="5.13">be slowing not doing as well anymore you</text>
  <text start="356.22" dur="3.66">know only like two months after Obama</text>
  <text start="358.35" dur="3.99">left office which is absolutely</text>
  <text start="359.88" dur="4.92">ridiculous what&amp;#39;s been really happening</text>
  <text start="362.34" dur="5.97">here is that the economy has been built</text>
  <text start="364.8" dur="6.17">on this fake recovery now this fake</text>
  <text start="368.31" dur="5.43">recovery is completely disappearing and</text>
  <text start="370.97" dur="4.69">it&amp;#39;s not just happening on its own of</text>
  <text start="373.74" dur="4.35">course the central banks are helping</text>
  <text start="375.66" dur="4.14">along and they&amp;#39;re getting prepared and</text>
  <text start="378.09" dur="4.38">ready to bring this entire system down</text>
  <text start="379.8" dur="5.16">because they want to blame this on</text>
  <text start="382.47" dur="3.6">another party they don&amp;#39;t want themselves</text>
  <text start="384.96" dur="2.97">to be blamed and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="386.07" dur="3.9">something coming out of left field where</text>
  <text start="387.93" dur="4.62">all of a sudden they have no control</text>
  <text start="389.97" dur="4.74">over it they need control and just</text>
  <text start="392.55" dur="3.9">because they create the currency just</text>
  <text start="394.71" dur="3.78">because they could they control the</text>
  <text start="396.45" dur="5.13">stock market they don&amp;#39;t really control</text>
  <text start="398.49" dur="7.59">the individuals who go out and spend</text>
  <text start="401.58" dur="6.81">money who use their funds because they</text>
  <text start="406.08" dur="4.62">don&amp;#39;t have total control they do have</text>
  <text start="408.39" dur="5.04">some control but they&amp;#39;re always nervous</text>
  <text start="410.7" dur="4.28">about something happening and this is</text>
  <text start="413.43" dur="4.29">why they want to bring this down</text>
  <text start="414.98" dur="4.66">themselves now Deutsche Bank is out</text>
  <text start="417.72" dur="4.8">there and they&amp;#39;re saying that the Fed</text>
  <text start="419.64" dur="6.42">just gaped from just enough rope to hang</text>
  <text start="422.52" dur="7.23">himself in outdoor Bank their credit</text>
  <text start="426.06" dur="5.04">derivatives expert Alexander cosec he</text>
  <text start="429.75" dur="3.45">writes that there are basically two</text>
  <text start="431.1" dur="5.16">different possible endings to the</text>
  <text start="433.2" dur="5.67">current economic situation or as he puts</text>
  <text start="436.26" dur="5.46">it the future is bimodal with volatility</text>
  <text start="438.87" dur="6.9">to be found between politics verse</text>
  <text start="441.72" dur="7.92">policy now in the march ethanol FOMC</text>
  <text start="445.77" dur="4.679">package it implies effectively a real</text>
  <text start="449.64" dur="3.329">ray try</text>
  <text start="450.449" dur="4.56">and is most likely bearish for break</text>
  <text start="452.969" dur="4.32">evens which could diminish the effect of</text>
  <text start="455.009" dur="4.351">the border tax on the trade deficit and</text>
  <text start="457.289" dur="4.981">as such reduced the impact on growth</text>
  <text start="459.36" dur="5.04">potential now depending on the interplay</text>
  <text start="462.27" dur="4.38">of politics and policy degree of</text>
  <text start="464.4" dur="3.87">political resolve and the Fed actions we</text>
  <text start="466.65" dur="4.319">could see two distinct paths a</text>
  <text start="468.27" dur="5.639">resolution of the existing pensions in</text>
  <text start="470.969" dur="4.35">the mid or long run on one hand it</text>
  <text start="473.909" dur="3.51">appears that the Fed is removing</text>
  <text start="475.319" dur="5.07">uncertainty around the terminal rate</text>
  <text start="477.419" dur="5.22">while on the other politics is creating</text>
  <text start="480.389" dur="4.74">a binary outcome which could have a</text>
  <text start="482.639" dur="6.15">dramatically different effect on long</text>
  <text start="485.129" dur="6.271">rates put simply the Fed has given Trump</text>
  <text start="488.789" dur="5.071">just enough rope to hang himself with</text>
  <text start="491.4" dur="3.989">and since all that matters now is how</text>
  <text start="493.86" dur="3.779">effective the president will be passing</text>
  <text start="495.389" dur="4.71">his political agenda which is not</text>
  <text start="497.639" dur="4.83">looking good should trump fail the one</text>
  <text start="500.099" dur="4.861">of two possible outcomes that is most</text>
  <text start="502.469" dur="5.37">likely is the one where the curve bear</text>
  <text start="504.96" dur="7.11">flattens or inverts prompting the next</text>
  <text start="507.839" dur="7.171">long collapse that is what we are headed</text>
  <text start="512.07" dur="5.449">for this is what the Fed has done</text>
  <text start="515.01" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re bringing him into a situation</text>
  <text start="517.519" dur="5.591">where they&amp;#39;re going to collapse the</text>
  <text start="519.75" dur="5.699">economy around him and the chaos is</text>
  <text start="523.11" dur="4.38">going to pick up as we move into the</text>
  <text start="525.449" dur="4.5">spring as we move into the summer and</text>
  <text start="527.49" dur="4.649">things are going to get worse if you</text>
  <text start="529.949" dur="4.921">notice the corporate media hasn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="532.139" dur="4.591">really mentioned the debt ceiling as of</text>
  <text start="534.87" dur="3.93">yet doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s going to be a big</text>
  <text start="536.73" dur="4.339">issue but they&amp;#39;re not even mentioning it</text>
  <text start="538.8" dur="5.31">and we know that there are additional</text>
  <text start="541.069" dur="5.71">FOMC meetings coming up and we know that</text>
  <text start="544.11" dur="4.11">the Fed is planning to raise the</text>
  <text start="546.779" dur="4.021">interest rates now if we see them raise</text>
  <text start="548.22" dur="4.799">the interest rate in the spring well</text>
  <text start="550.8" dur="4.71">guess what that is another signal if</text>
  <text start="553.019" dur="5.671">they don&amp;#39;t tackle the debt ceiling that</text>
  <text start="555.51" dur="6.329">is another indicator it&amp;#39;s all letting us</text>
  <text start="558.69" dur="5.759">know that they&amp;#39;re bringing this system</text>
  <text start="561.839" dur="5.19">down and they need to bring it down</text>
  <text start="564.449" dur="5.731">because the system cannot be sustained</text>
  <text start="567.029" dur="5.971">they need to transition into a new</text>
  <text start="570.18" dur="5.219">system now hopefully we transition into</text>
  <text start="573" dur="5.16">a system where the central bank is not</text>
  <text start="575.399" dur="5.37">involved but at this point we don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="578.16" dur="4.83">that happening we do see the painting of</text>
  <text start="580.769" dur="3.431">Andrew Jackson behind Trump we know that</text>
  <text start="582.99" dur="4.57">Andrew Jackson visit</text>
  <text start="584.2" dur="5.55">Andrew Jackson&amp;#39;s tomb this is sending us</text>
  <text start="587.56" dur="4.98">a signal that maybe he&amp;#39;s going to follow</text>
  <text start="589.75" dur="5.76">in the footsteps of Jackson but we need</text>
  <text start="592.54" dur="5.01">to wait to see his actions and so far a</text>
  <text start="595.51" dur="4.71">lot of his actions well they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="597.55" dur="5.28">following suit it looks like the deep</text>
  <text start="600.22" dur="5.46">state has control of a lot of what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="602.83" dur="6.15">doing right now we see there&amp;#39;s this huge</text>
  <text start="605.68" dur="5.64">trade war heading our way between the</text>
  <text start="608.98" dur="4.35">United States and China and right now</text>
  <text start="611.32" dur="3.72">the United States and China that are the</text>
  <text start="613.33" dur="4.11">two largest economies in the world by</text>
  <text start="615.04" dur="5.1">far and the upcoming trade war that is</text>
  <text start="617.44" dur="5.82">about to erupt will be cataclysmic for</text>
  <text start="620.14" dur="5.1">both sides the trump administration and</text>
  <text start="623.26" dur="4.68">the Chinese government well they&amp;#39;re both</text>
  <text start="625.24" dur="5.46">gearing up for the prolonged trade war</text>
  <text start="627.94" dur="5.79">and it&amp;#39;s going to be very severe</text>
  <text start="630.7" dur="6.24">implications for the entire global</text>
  <text start="633.73" dur="7.2">economy now over the past 10 years the</text>
  <text start="636.94" dur="7.05">US has run a trade deficit of over 2</text>
  <text start="640.93" dur="5.76">trillion with China and as a result of</text>
  <text start="643.99" dur="4.71">the inbound trade we have lost tens of</text>
  <text start="646.69" dur="3.87">thousands of manufacturing businesses</text>
  <text start="648.7" dur="4.2">millions of good-paying jobs and</text>
  <text start="650.56" dur="4.98">hundreds of billions of dollars of tax</text>

  <text start="790.21" dur="5.16">the American person it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="792.43" dur="4.85">absolutely awful and we know that the</text>

  <text start="797.28" dur="5.89">offshoring and moving all manufacturing</text>
  <text start="800.23" dur="5.43">jobs to China setting China up because</text>
  <text start="803.17" dur="3.99">the globalist knew that they needed to</text>
  <text start="805.66" dur="3.75">do something with the Treasury buns who</text>
  <text start="807.16" dur="4.05">is going to buy them so they made a deal</text>
  <text start="809.41" dur="4.11">with China listen we&amp;#39;ll move all</text>
  <text start="811.21" dur="4.35">manufacturing over to you as long as you</text>
  <text start="813.52" dur="5.19">buy the Treasury bond this whole deal</text>
  <text start="815.56" dur="5.94">was to keep their system going but</text>
  <text start="818.71" dur="5.99">eventually they knew that the system was</text>
  <text start="821.5" dur="6.18">going to die they knew that the dollar</text>
  <text start="824.7" dur="4.93">well it just couldn&amp;#39;t be devalued right</text>
  <text start="827.68" dur="4.2">off the bat because it would be a</text>
  <text start="829.63" dur="4.8">complete disaster in the United States</text>
  <text start="831.88" dur="5.94">and they knew they were just buying time</text>
  <text start="834.43" dur="6.24">moving everything off to China and then</text>
  <text start="837.82" dur="5.4">having China manufacture all these</text>
  <text start="840.67" dur="4.23">products really really cheap have them</text>
  <text start="843.22" dur="3.36">come back to the United States and make</text>
  <text start="844.9" dur="5.1">people believe that everything is fine</text>
