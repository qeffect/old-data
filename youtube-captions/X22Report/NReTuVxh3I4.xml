  <text start="61.11" dur="5.96">be prepared spring is coming and plans</text>
  <text start="64.47" dur="5.579">are in the works for the next event</text>
  <text start="67.07" dur="6.969">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="70.049" dur="6.811">political mg of political news yesterday</text>
  <text start="74.039" dur="5.58">we talked about Sweden and how there</text>
  <text start="76.86" dur="4.38">were problems with the immigrants where</text>
  <text start="79.619" dur="6.95">they were writing setting cars on fire</text>
  <text start="81.24" dur="8.4">and chain Frick he runs a news outlet</text>
  <text start="86.569" dur="7.451">where he goes around with his camera in</text>
  <text start="89.64" dur="6.869">Sweden around the suburbs and reports on</text>
  <text start="94.02" dur="5.639">what&amp;#39;s really going on because basically</text>
  <text start="96.509" dur="5.31">what is happening is that the mainstream</text>
  <text start="99.659" dur="5.971">media out in Sweden they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="101.819" dur="6.451">reporting almost really going on and he</text>
  <text start="105.63" dur="5.39">says that when he looks and he takes</text>
  <text start="108.27" dur="6.17">pictures and he sees what&amp;#39;s going on and</text>
  <text start="111.02" dur="6.04">he&amp;#39;s inside the migrant dominated areas</text>
  <text start="114.44" dur="5.11">he sees that almost every evening cars</text>
  <text start="117.06" dur="5.49">are set on fire and police officers are</text>
  <text start="119.55" dur="4.769">attacked by criminal gangs and he says</text>
  <text start="122.55" dur="5.159">you don&amp;#39;t read very much about this in</text>
  <text start="124.319" dur="6.481">the Swedish mainstream media and he says</text>
  <text start="127.709" dur="5.161">that the Swedish MSM well they really</text>
  <text start="130.8" dur="6.269">don&amp;#39;t tell the people the whole picture</text>
  <text start="132.87" dur="6.99">they really are leaving a lot of the</text>
  <text start="137.069" dur="6.721">story out and they&amp;#39;re trying to paint a</text>
  <text start="139.86" dur="6.51">picture that everything is fine and we</text>
  <text start="143.79" dur="5.279">can see right now that things are not</text>
  <text start="146.37" dur="5.729">fine and it&amp;#39;s not just in Sweden it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="149.069" dur="7.051">many different countries and we can see</text>
  <text start="152.099" dur="7.951">at this point that there has to be some</text>
  <text start="156.12" dur="7.02">way somehow to look at each individual</text>
  <text start="160.05" dur="5.13">and to make sure that these are the</text>
  <text start="163.14" dur="4.47">people you want in the country and this</text>
  <text start="165.18" dur="7.11">is why there&amp;#39;s borders this is why you</text>
  <text start="167.61" dur="6.81">have a vetting process now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="172.29" dur="5.7">interesting about all of this is that</text>
  <text start="174.42" dur="6.1">there was a poll that was done and it</text>
  <text start="177.99" dur="4.56">was done by Harvard Harris this was</text>
  <text start="180.52" dur="5.49">done for the hill found that an</text>
  <text start="182.55" dur="5.29">overwhelming majority of Americans said</text>
  <text start="186.01" dur="4.32">that eighty percent in fact believe that</text>
  <text start="187.84" dur="4.47">illegal immigrants arrested for crimes</text>
  <text start="190.33" dur="4.05">should be turned over to federal</text>
  <text start="192.31" dur="4.38">immigration authorities rather than</text>
  <text start="194.38" dur="6.06">being harbored in so-called sanctuary</text>
  <text start="196.69" dur="5.85">cities so imagine that Americans do</text>
  <text start="200.44" dur="4.02">believe that local state and federal law</text>
  <text start="202.54" dur="6.18">enforcement officials should actually</text>
  <text start="204.46" dur="5.67">enforce the law meanwhile fifty two</text>
  <text start="208.72" dur="3.66">percent of those surveyed said they</text>
  <text start="210.13" dur="4.98">support Trump&amp;#39;s executive order to build</text>
  <text start="212.38" dur="4.44">a border wall and revoke funding for</text>
  <text start="215.11" dur="3.12">sanctuary cities well fifty-three</text>
  <text start="216.82" dur="4.8">percent say they support this</text>
  <text start="218.23" dur="5.46">immigration ban now of course this is</text>
  <text start="221.62" dur="4.86">undoubtedly unwelcome news for those</text>
  <text start="223.69" dur="6.05">sanctuary cities because we know they</text>
  <text start="226.48" dur="6.48">receive a lot of federal subsidies</text>
  <text start="229.74" dur="5.74">roughly around 2.3 billion dollars every</text>
  <text start="232.96" dur="4.77">year and these are the top ten sanctuary</text>
  <text start="235.48" dur="5.16">cities and they don&amp;#39;t want to give this</text>
  <text start="237.73" dur="5.82">up and we can see at this point the</text>
  <text start="240.64" dur="5.01">corporate media they&amp;#39;re still with the</text>
  <text start="243.55" dur="6.45">agenda with the deep state the elite and</text>
  <text start="245.65" dur="7.44">they&amp;#39;re pushing their agenda saying that</text>
  <text start="250" dur="5.31">you know we&amp;#39;re America we should accept</text>
  <text start="253.09" dur="4.59">all these illegals now they use these</text>
  <text start="255.31" dur="5.19">illegals for many different parts of</text>
  <text start="257.68" dur="4.86">their agenda one for voter fraud they</text>
  <text start="260.5" dur="4.74">bring them in of course with Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="262.54" dur="5.46">executive order when he actually signed</text>
  <text start="265.24" dur="4.5">it right after the mid elections because</text>
  <text start="268" dur="4.8">he knew that the people were not for</text>
  <text start="269.74" dur="5.34">this where people who jumped over the</text>
  <text start="272.8" dur="4.11">border came into this country they were</text>
  <text start="275.08" dur="5.04">allowed to stay in this country now</text>
  <text start="276.91" dur="5.91">these individuals are illegal they came</text>
  <text start="280.12" dur="4.35">into the country illegally there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="282.82" dur="4.26">difference between illegal immigrant and</text>
  <text start="284.47" dur="4.65">immigrant an immigrant who wants to come</text>
  <text start="287.08" dur="3.63">to this country goes through the process</text>
  <text start="289.12" dur="5.67">goes through the through the vetting</text>
  <text start="290.71" dur="8.64">process and gets everything completed</text>
  <text start="294.79" dur="6.12">and is allowed into the country and I</text>
  <text start="299.35" dur="4.89">think what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is</text>
  <text start="300.91" dur="6.66">they&amp;#39;re trying to merge the two illegal</text>
  <text start="304.24" dur="6.45">immigrant and immigrant and you can see</text>
  <text start="307.57" dur="5.559">that they&amp;#39;re playing off of this there</text>
  <text start="310.69" dur="5.369">are two very distinct things</text>
  <text start="313.129" dur="7.11">again they&amp;#39;re using terms like racist</text>
  <text start="316.059" dur="6.43">illegal immigrant is not a race and you</text>
  <text start="320.239" dur="4.44">cannot be racist against an illegal</text>
  <text start="322.489" dur="6.57">immigrant it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m a racist against</text>
  <text start="324.679" dur="6.24">criminals it&amp;#39;s absolutely ridiculous but</text>
  <text start="329.059" dur="3.96">you can see what their plans are and</text>
  <text start="330.919" dur="5.55">this is why they&amp;#39;re out there every</text>
  <text start="333.019" dur="5.07">single time saying well you know if his</text>
  <text start="336.469" dur="3.18">band goes through then all the</text>
  <text start="338.089" dur="3">immigrants in the country they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="339.649" dur="3.931">going to buy houses and that can crash</text>
  <text start="341.089" dur="5.28">the housing market know those people</text>
  <text start="343.58" dur="5.25">here legally they can still buy their</text>
  <text start="346.369" dur="4.17">homes if they&amp;#39;re making enough money and</text>
  <text start="348.83" dur="3.78">they have credit well I guess you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="350.539" dur="3.571">even need credit today they still can</text>
  <text start="352.61" dur="5.399">buy homes but they&amp;#39;re trying to make the</text>
  <text start="354.11" dur="7.739">case what is happening here is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="358.009" dur="6.481">merging the two which it should not be</text>
  <text start="361.849" dur="4.201">done and everyone does the vetting</text>
  <text start="364.49" dur="4.379">process everyone has a door in their</text>
  <text start="366.05" dur="5.669">house do you leave the door open letting</text>
  <text start="368.869" dur="4.95">anyone in no you have a close someone</text>
  <text start="371.719" dur="4.68">knocks at your door you say hello and</text>
  <text start="373.819" dur="4.35">you start the vetting process I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="376.399" dur="4.17">know you who are you what do you want</text>
  <text start="378.169" dur="4.441">what are you doing right now you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="380.569" dur="6.84">protecting your border your vetting the</text>
  <text start="382.61" dur="7.5">person everyone in this country does</text>
  <text start="387.409" dur="5">this I know there&amp;#39;s going to be people</text>
  <text start="390.11" dur="6.089">think oh I just let anyone in my house I</text>
  <text start="392.409" dur="7.72">beg to differ so what we can see right</text>
  <text start="396.199" dur="8.041">now is the deep state the elite they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="400.129" dur="7.861">still pushing their agenda now we know</text>
  <text start="404.24" dur="6.389">that leakers have been exposed in the</text>
  <text start="407.99" dur="6.419">Trump administration Katie Walsh one of</text>
  <text start="410.629" dur="7.44">them previs well it looks like he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="414.409" dur="6.54">another leaker another problem that most</text>
  <text start="418.069" dur="5.58">likely Trump should get rid of him now</text>
  <text start="420.949" dur="4.2">he&amp;#39;s trying to save face right now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="423.649" dur="4.41">out there he&amp;#39;s the White House chief of</text>
  <text start="425.149" dur="5.93">staff he&amp;#39;s out there saying that he</text>
  <text start="428.059" dur="5.61">talked to the top Intel community and</text>
  <text start="431.079" dur="5.8">they assured him that there was no</text>
  <text start="433.669" dur="6.39">collusion between Trump and Russia now</text>
  <text start="436.879" dur="4.861">this is already said and done because we</text>
  <text start="440.059" dur="3.09">could see that everything that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="441.74" dur="3.509">been reporting on is completely fake</text>
  <text start="443.149" dur="3.811">phony and false but it looks like he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="445.249" dur="4.111">out there trying to say no no</text>
  <text start="446.96" dur="7.59">i&amp;#39;m lee Trump imma Trump but we can see</text>
  <text start="449.36" dur="9.33">right now he&amp;#39;s not really with Trump we</text>
  <text start="454.55" dur="7.35">see John McCain he&amp;#39;s the one who gave</text>
  <text start="458.69" dur="6.629">that dossier to the CIA and leaked it to</text>
  <text start="461.9" dur="6.03">the news which was a complete hoax well</text>
  <text start="465.319" dur="5.901">it turns out the White House just</text>
  <text start="467.93" dur="7.049">fingered John McCain as a media leaker</text>
  <text start="471.22" dur="7.509">he&amp;#39;s also been eavesdropping on Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="474.979" dur="6.421">classified phone calls and there are</text>
  <text start="478.729" dur="5.451">others are saying besides McCain who are</text>
  <text start="481.4" dur="6.06">doing a lot of the leaking remember</text>
  <text start="484.18" dur="5.76">those who are in power Democrat</text>
  <text start="487.46" dur="5.31">Republican doesn&amp;#39;t matter who they are</text>
  <text start="489.94" dur="5.949">when their power their control is</text>
  <text start="492.77" dur="8.19">threatened they will go to any lengths</text>
  <text start="495.889" dur="9.361">to stop it and we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="500.96" dur="7.139">that all these individuals well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="505.25" dur="6.15">part of the deep state the elite the</text>
  <text start="508.099" dur="5.791">agenda and Trump doesn&amp;#39;t fit into this</text>
  <text start="511.4" dur="6.389">mold he doesn&amp;#39;t fit into any of this</text>
  <text start="513.89" dur="7.38">actually and this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="517.789" dur="6.691">all of this happen right now and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="521.27" dur="8.189">not done they&amp;#39;re going to be pushing</text>
  <text start="524.48" dur="8.76">their agenda to the next level now back</text>
  <text start="529.459" dur="8.271">in January the Hungarian Prime Minister</text>
  <text start="533.24" dur="7.68">well he lashed out against Soros and</text>
  <text start="537.73" dur="5.56">accused Soros of deploying tons of money</text>
  <text start="540.92" dur="5.25">and international heavy artillery to his</text>
  <text start="543.29" dur="6.45">country and we can see there was an</text>
  <text start="546.17" dur="7.89">attack on Soros in the past we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="549.74" dur="7.26">that soros well he has been using his</text>
  <text start="554.06" dur="7.29">money to fund NGOs and certain groups</text>
  <text start="557" dur="8.73">for certain regime change for protests</text>
  <text start="561.35" dur="7.679">and things like that now just days</text>
  <text start="565.73" dur="5.58">earlier Republican lawmakers in</text>
  <text start="569.029" dur="6.841">Washington had started asking questions</text>
  <text start="571.31" dur="8.41">about whether US tax dollars also we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="575.87" dur="7.509">being used to fund sources projects in</text>
  <text start="579.72" dur="6.39">the country of Macedonia representative</text>
  <text start="583.379" dur="5.58">Christopher Smith let a group of House</text>
  <text start="586.11" dur="5.49">lawmakers in writing to ambassador just</text>
  <text start="588.959" dur="6">Bailey and Obama pointy demanding</text>
  <text start="591.6" dur="6.179">answers Smith voiced concerns that tax</text>
  <text start="594.959" dur="4.951">dollars are supporting Soros activities</text>
  <text start="597.779" dur="3.75">in trying to have a socialist government</text>
  <text start="599.91" dur="5.4">replace the current Conservative</text>
  <text start="601.529" dur="6.74">government in the small nation and they</text>
  <text start="605.31" dur="7.469">started an investigation to look into</text>
  <text start="608.269" dur="6.161">George Soros and his dealings they say</text>
  <text start="612.779" dur="4.11">that they&amp;#39;ve received credit reports</text>
  <text start="614.43" dur="5.06">credible reports that over the past few</text>
  <text start="616.889" dur="5.19">years the US mission to Macedonia has</text>
  <text start="619.49" dur="5.44">actively interviewing intervene in the</text>
  <text start="622.079" dur="5.281">party politics of Macedonia as well as</text>
  <text start="624.93" dur="5.73">shaping of its media environment and</text>
  <text start="627.36" dur="6.12">civil society often favoring groups of</text>
  <text start="630.66" dur="5.489">one political persuasion over another</text>
  <text start="633.48" dur="6.93">and we can see right now they are</text>
  <text start="636.149" dur="6.93">looking into his dealings not just out</text>
  <text start="640.41" dur="5.159">in Macedonia but here in the United</text>
  <text start="643.079" dur="6.781">States because we understand that George</text>
  <text start="645.569" dur="7.921">Soros well he funds a lot of NGOs he</text>
  <text start="649.86" dur="7.199">puts together protests because he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="653.49" dur="6.63">billionaire who wants what he wants he</text>
  <text start="657.059" dur="6.15">wants a one-world government he wants to</text>
  <text start="660.12" dur="5.31">control the people and we can see right</text>

  <text start="814.57" dur="7.62">remove him by getting rid of him by</text>
  <text start="817.42" dur="6.6">assassinating him now Robert steel is</text>
  <text start="822.19" dur="6.36">saying that Trump is not going to make</text>
  <text start="824.02" dur="6.66">it until 2018 we can sue already that</text>
  <text start="828.55" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re building the narrative to blame</text>
  <text start="830.68" dur="6.62">everything that&amp;#39;s happening right now on</text>
  <text start="832.45" dur="9.81">him and we can see at this point that</text>
  <text start="837.3" dur="8.289">people within his administration they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="842.26" dur="4.65">not really with him they&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="845.589" dur="5.371">because</text>
  <text start="846.91" dur="7.02">certain individuals were pointing Trump</text>
  <text start="850.96" dur="6.63">in certain directions to do what they</text>
  <text start="853.93" dur="6.63">wanted and they&amp;#39;re prepared and ready to</text>
  <text start="857.59" dur="7.44">take over once he&amp;#39;s gone one way or</text>
  <text start="860.56" dur="9.18">another so we can see that the plans are</text>
  <text start="865.03" dur="7.56">already in motion and it looks like as</text>
  <text start="869.74" dur="6.24">we move into the spring we move into the</text>
  <text start="872.59" dur="7.46">summer well things are just going to get</text>
  <text start="875.98" dur="7.11">a lot hotter and that&amp;#39;s no pun intended</text>
  <text start="880.05" dur="8.71">because we can see right now these</text>
  <text start="883.09" dur="7.44">individuals they had a plan they still</text>
  <text start="888.76" dur="5.25">are trying to reach their goal they</text>
  <text start="890.53" dur="8.13">haven&amp;#39;t stopped now out in North Korea</text>
  <text start="894.01" dur="8.31">we can see that the u.s. the UN they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="898.66" dur="6.78">making the case that Kim jong-un he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="902.32" dur="4.8">war criminal he&amp;#39;s saying after he killed</text>

  <text start="917.26" dur="8.7">saying that he is isolated right now now</text>
  <text start="920.8" dur="8.06">once again most likely the CIA was</text>
  <text start="925.96" dur="5.91">involved in this entire thing Intel</text>
  <text start="928.86" dur="6.37">Intel agencies were involved in all this</text>
  <text start="931.87" dur="8.91">and we can see why they&amp;#39;ve been pushing</text>
  <text start="935.23" dur="9.3">their agenda quite a bit because Donald</text>
  <text start="940.78" dur="6.9">Trump president Trump they wanted to</text>
  <text start="944.53" dur="6.48">begin talks with North Korea now if you</text>
  <text start="947.68" dur="8.16">remember back North Korea wanted a half</text>
  <text start="951.01" dur="6.87">talks with then President Obama saying</text>
  <text start="955.84" dur="3.75">let&amp;#39;s talk about the nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="957.88" dur="3.81">let&amp;#39;s talk about what is going on here</text>
  <text start="959.59" dur="3.33">and the Obama administration said</text>
  <text start="961.69" dur="4.14">absolutely not we&amp;#39;re not talking to you</text>
  <text start="962.92" dur="6.33">whatsoever we&amp;#39;re bringing in military</text>
  <text start="965.83" dur="4.53">assets into South Korea that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="969.25" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;re doing so there&amp;#39;s no talking</text>
  <text start="970.36" dur="6.87">there&amp;#39;s no conversation Trump wants to</text>
  <text start="974.11" dur="6.19">have a conversation with the North</text>
  <text start="977.23" dur="5.89">Korean leader and guess what</text>
  <text start="980.3" dur="4.2">the deep state the elite they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="983.12" dur="7.95">this this is why all this is happening</text>
  <text start="984.5" dur="8.79">right now we see that China coming from</text>
  <text start="991.07" dur="4.83">the corporate media they&amp;#39;re planning to</text>
  <text start="993.29" dur="4.8">deploy Sam batteries on the South China</text>
  <text start="995.9" dur="4.65">Seas now of course they haven&amp;#39;t done it</text>
  <text start="998.09" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re saying well it looks like this</text>
  <text start="1000.55" dur="3.54">is what they&amp;#39;re going to do it looks</text>
  <text start="1002.44" dur="5.34">like this is what they&amp;#39;re setting it up</text>
  <text start="1004.09" dur="5.01">for and we see tillerson well he told</text>
  <text start="1007.78" dur="3.3">the Senate Foreign Relations Committee</text>
  <text start="1009.1" dur="4.32">that China&amp;#39;s building of islands and</text>
  <text start="1011.08" dur="5.67">putting military assets on them was akin</text>
  <text start="1013.42" dur="5.79">to Russia&amp;#39;s taking Crimea from Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1016.75" dur="5.58">while Crimea was always part of Russia</text>
  <text start="1019.21" dur="5.61">first of all the United States went into</text>
  <text start="1022.33" dur="4.77">Ukraine had a coup d&amp;#39;etat with Victoria</text>
  <text start="1024.82" dur="4.62">Nuland at the helm spent five billion</text>
  <text start="1027.1" dur="5.22">dollars and Crimea decided you know what</text>
  <text start="1029.44" dur="6.63">we want to be part of this this was a</text>
  <text start="1032.32" dur="6.54">regime change in Ukraine and we can see</text>
  <text start="1036.07" dur="4.88">at this point going back in time to</text>
  <text start="1038.86" dur="6.63">World War two with the cairo declaration</text>
  <text start="1040.95" dur="9.52">the United States help China get these</text>
  <text start="1045.49" dur="7.05">islands back from Japan so all of this</text>
  <text start="1050.47" dur="5.58">that they&amp;#39;re telling us is completely</text>
  <text start="1052.54" dur="7.32">fake phony and false they&amp;#39;re building up</text>
  <text start="1056.05" dur="5.94">war propaganda and again those</text>
  <text start="1059.86" dur="4.29">individuals in administration they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1061.99" dur="4.74">part of the problem actually should be</text>
  <text start="1064.15" dur="5.43">all cleaned out in saying this for a</text>
  <text start="1066.73" dur="5.67">very long time and we need to change</text>
  <text start="1069.58" dur="5.49">certain rules in the government where</text>
  <text start="1072.4" dur="5.88">they can&amp;#39;t accept money from lobbyists</text>
  <text start="1075.07" dur="4.53">from certain groups actually to strip</text>
  <text start="1078.28" dur="3.5">away the benefits and everything we</text>
  <text start="1079.6" dur="6.06">shouldn&amp;#39;t even have career politicians</text>
  <text start="1081.78" dur="5.59">now out in Kiev we&amp;#39;re seeing that Kiev</text>
  <text start="1085.66" dur="4.23">is not going to withdraw their weapons</text>
  <text start="1087.37" dur="4.92">from the contact line they were supposed</text>
  <text start="1089.89" dur="5.4">to have a video conference they decline</text>
  <text start="1092.29" dur="6.56">that and we see that poroshenko is out</text>
  <text start="1095.29" dur="7.88">there once again saying that Russia is</text>
  <text start="1098.85" dur="7.69">attempting another revolution in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1103.17" dur="7.24">because right now he&amp;#39;s saying there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1106.54" dur="4.91">going to be a third made on and we can</text>
  <text start="1110.41" dur="3.019">see that there</text>
  <text start="1111.45" dur="4.92">their agenda they&amp;#39;re playing it up</text>
  <text start="1113.429" dur="4.321">because they want to start a war there</text>
  <text start="1116.37" dur="4.2">have been pushing the war we know that</text>
  <text start="1117.75" dur="6.289">McCain and Graham they were out in</text>
  <text start="1120.57" dur="7.02">Ukraine speaking to the leaders Ashley</text>
  <text start="1124.039" dur="6.341">most likely this is a violation of the</text>
  <text start="1127.59" dur="4.579">logan act but he was out there saying</text>
  <text start="1130.38" dur="4.2">this is the year of the offensive</text>
  <text start="1132.169" dur="4.421">letting everyone know we are starting</text>
  <text start="1134.58" dur="3.719">this and what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="1136.59" dur="4.439">all this all this Russian aggression and</text>
  <text start="1138.299" dur="7.201">all this Russian bassant bashing well</text>
  <text start="1141.029" dur="7.801">this was all done through Obama&amp;#39;s term</text>
  <text start="1145.5" dur="5.61">actually back in 2012 before Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1148.83" dur="4.65">second term the favorability rating</text>
  <text start="1151.11" dur="4.919">towards Russia was fifty percent the</text>
  <text start="1153.48" dur="5.579">year before that in 2011 it was 51% and</text>
  <text start="1156.029" dur="6.24">it has been reasonably stable until</text>
  <text start="1159.059" dur="6.781">obama&amp;#39;s reelection where it completely</text>
  <text start="1162.269" dur="7.04">dropped and we can see that during this</text>
  <text start="1165.84" dur="8.78">point of obama&amp;#39;s turned from 2012 on</text>
  <text start="1169.309" dur="9.401">Russia became unfavorable Americans were</text>
  <text start="1174.62" dur="6.88">more hostile towards Russia and this was</text>
  <text start="1178.71" dur="4.5">because the Obama administration the</text>
  <text start="1181.5" dur="3.389">corporate media were playing up that</text>
  <text start="1183.21" dur="5.36">Russia was coming to get us Russia was</text>
  <text start="1184.889" dur="7.591">coming to get us before that time period</text>
  <text start="1188.57" dur="5.91">we didn&amp;#39;t see anything like this and we</text>
  <text start="1192.48" dur="5.37">can see this was part of their agenda</text>
  <text start="1194.48" dur="5.38">now there&amp;#39;s a lot of talks about safe</text>
  <text start="1197.85" dur="4.169">zones where they&amp;#39;re saying that Trump</text>
  <text start="1199.86" dur="5.909">wants a safe zone he wants to put</text>
  <text start="1202.019" dur="7.111">refugees in there and Lavrov is out</text>
  <text start="1205.769" dur="7.951">there saying listen in regards to safe</text>
  <text start="1209.13" dur="8.759">zones if the US wants to do this they</text>
  <text start="1213.72" dur="8.1">need to coordinate with Syria and Russia</text>
  <text start="1217.889" dur="8.551">and Syria would protect those</text>
  <text start="1221.82" dur="8.16">individuals in these safe zones not the</text>
  <text start="1226.44" dur="6.63">United States because the United States</text>
  <text start="1229.98" dur="6.179">would use these safe zones to mount an</text>
  <text start="1233.07" dur="6.27">all-out war against Assad this was the</text>
  <text start="1236.159" dur="8.041">original plan and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1239.34" dur="5.98">right now is that these neocons these</text>
  <text start="1244.2" dur="2.65">elite the deeps</text>
  <text start="1245.32" dur="4.92">eight they&amp;#39;re still pushing their agenda</text>
  <text start="1246.85" dur="6.329">now the UN came out after their</text>
  <text start="1250.24" dur="5.309">fact-finding mission they are showing</text>
  <text start="1253.179" dur="5.49">that Assad is using chemical weapons a</text>
  <text start="1255.549" dur="7.13">new report came out and in the report</text>
  <text start="1258.669" dur="6.72">what do they show well they show that</text>
  <text start="1262.679" dur="4.061">from all the different tweets and all</text>
  <text start="1265.389" dur="4.62">the different entries in facebook</text>
  <text start="1266.74" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;ve compiled all of this and it</text>
  <text start="1270.009" dur="4.17">shows that Assad is using chemical</text>
  <text start="1271.75" dur="5.009">weapons this was their research they</text>
  <text start="1274.179" dur="6.541">didn&amp;#39;t go to Syria they didn&amp;#39;t do a</text>
  <text start="1276.759" dur="7.88">fact-finding mission they cited Twitter</text>
  <text start="1280.72" dur="7.89">posts and WordPress blogs as evidence</text>
  <text start="1284.639" dur="7.75">against Assad I mean this is absolutely</text>
  <text start="1288.61" dur="5.669">ridiculous so they copy and pasted all</text>
  <text start="1292.389" dur="5.01">this and most of them came from the</text>
  <text start="1294.279" dur="4.801">white helmets which is a paid group of</text>
  <text start="1297.399" dur="5.581">the United States government central</text>

  <text start="1362.32" dur="4.109">actually fighting the Islamic state and</text>
  <text start="1364.69" dur="4.38">what would be the purpose at this point</text>

  <text start="1369.07" dur="5.099">there if they truly wanted to fight the</text>
  <text start="1372.129" dur="4.981">Islamic state they would work with</text>
  <text start="1374.169" dur="4.681">Russia right now but we could see at</text>
