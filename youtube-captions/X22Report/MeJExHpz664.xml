  <text start="144" dur="4.2">and we know that the Cabal they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="146.549" dur="3.421">putting pressure on Venezuela because</text>
  <text start="148.2" dur="5.009">again they want their natural resources</text>
  <text start="149.97" dur="6.329">they want the country to implode on</text>
  <text start="153.209" dur="5">itself they want regime change they want</text>
  <text start="156.299" dur="4.261">to take over everything that is there</text>
  <text start="158.209" dur="3.551">meanwhile here in the United States what</text>
  <text start="160.56" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re trying to keep</text>
  <text start="161.76" dur="4.08">up the idea that yeah look the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="164.43" dur="3.6">great Trump is out there telling you</text>
  <text start="165.84" dur="4.32">that the economy is great he has done</text>
  <text start="168.03" dur="4.92">absolutely nothing to the economy right</text>
  <text start="170.16" dur="4.88">now no new manufacturing mysterious</text>
  <text start="172.95" dur="4.289">mysteriously appeared in the country</text>
  <text start="175.04" dur="5.35">where we haven&amp;#39;t made any deals with</text>
  <text start="177.239" dur="5.491">NAFTA nothing has really changed we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="180.39" dur="4.709">on the same exact course as we were with</text>
  <text start="182.73" dur="3.69">Obama what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="185.099" dur="4.47">continually manipul</text>
  <text start="186.42" dur="5.58">all the numbers and when we look at this</text>
  <text start="189.569" dur="5.64">we can see that they expected the</text>
  <text start="192" dur="6.24">payroll numbers to be about 300,000</text>
  <text start="195.209" dur="7.471">after last month&amp;#39;s negative print and</text>
  <text start="198.24" dur="6.18">the numbers hit around 260 1000 now</text>
  <text start="202.68" dur="4.2">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="204.42" dur="5.4">average hourly earnings which was</text>
  <text start="206.88" dur="5.579">expected to rise around 2.7 year-on-year</text>
  <text start="209.82" dur="5.1">also missed printing a 2.4 percent</text>
  <text start="212.459" dur="6.421">instead with September revised lowered</text>
  <text start="214.92" dur="5.88">to 2.8 percent a worse on a monthly</text>
  <text start="218.88" dur="7.2">basis there was no wage increase at all</text>
  <text start="220.8" dur="7.86">printing at 0% so with all that said the</text>
  <text start="226.08" dur="5.22">real action this time was found in the</text>
  <text start="228.66" dur="6.6">previous month September and that was</text>
  <text start="231.3" dur="7.35">revised higher from negative 33,000 to a</text>
  <text start="235.26" dur="5.97">positive 18,000 where August was revised</text>
  <text start="238.65" dur="5.01">up from 169 thousand to two hundred and</text>
  <text start="241.23" dur="5.52">eight thousand for a total two-month</text>
  <text start="243.66" dur="4.829">revision of 90,000 additionally the</text>
  <text start="246.75" dur="3.87">unemployment rate dropped to a new</text>
  <text start="248.489" dur="4.881">psycho low declining to four point one</text>
  <text start="250.62" dur="5.489">percent from four point two percent and</text>
  <text start="253.37" dur="3.85">the underemployment rate declined to</text>
  <text start="256.109" dur="4.021">seven point nine percent the lowest</text>
  <text start="257.22" dur="4.35">since the start of the century now we</text>
  <text start="260.13" dur="3.27">know these numbers are absolutely</text>
  <text start="261.57" dur="4.65">ridiculous we know that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="263.4" dur="6.11">completely manipulated because we have</text>
  <text start="266.22" dur="6.84">not added anything here except for</text>
  <text start="269.51" dur="5.62">waiters waitresses and bartenders and</text>
  <text start="273.06" dur="5.94">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the food</text>
  <text start="275.13" dur="6.69">and service drink places well they had a</text>
  <text start="279" dur="7.669">negative print last month and all of a</text>
  <text start="281.82" dur="7.469">sudden we were pushed up by eighty eight</text>
  <text start="286.669" dur="5.831">thousand five hundred waiters and</text>
  <text start="289.289" dur="7.291">bartenders that all of a sudden found</text>
  <text start="292.5" dur="7.169">jobs now this is very interesting so if</text>
  <text start="296.58" dur="5.22">we put this number into context the</text>
  <text start="299.669" dur="6.391">record increased foodservice and drink</text>
  <text start="301.8" dur="8.369">places draw jobs increased by thirty</text>
  <text start="306.06" dur="6.75">four percent of all the 261 thousand</text>
  <text start="310.169" dur="5.31">jobs added in October now this is all</text>
  <text start="312.81" dur="5.55">very interesting because when we look at</text>
  <text start="315.479" dur="4.381">the retailers and we&amp;#39;re approaching the</text>
  <text start="318.36" dur="5.609">holiday seasons</text>
  <text start="319.86" dur="6.929">retailers cut around 8,000 jobs right</text>
  <text start="323.969" dur="5.19">before the holiday season now normally</text>
  <text start="326.789" dur="4.921">they&amp;#39;re adding on like crazy they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="329.159" dur="6.091">cutting jobs right now because there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="331.71" dur="5.459">lot of stores still closing and they</text>
  <text start="335.25" dur="3.75">understand that if they don&amp;#39;t make it</text>
  <text start="337.169" dur="3.09">through this holiday season and it looks</text>
  <text start="339" dur="2.31">like they&amp;#39;re trying to cut cost anywhere</text>
  <text start="340.259" dur="2.731">they possibly can</text>
  <text start="341.31" dur="3.329">they&amp;#39;re gonna be closing down and I</text>
  <text start="342.99" dur="4.889">think we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot of stores</text>
  <text start="344.639" dur="4.71">closed down after this holiday season</text>
  <text start="347.879" dur="3.121">because we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot reporting</text>
  <text start="349.349" dur="3.481">and last time we saw it during the</text>
  <text start="351" dur="4.139">holiday season and we can see that all</text>
  <text start="352.83" dur="4.32">these stores even the online centers</text>
  <text start="355.139" dur="3.78">like Amazon and the rest they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="357.15" dur="5.16">starting their Black Friday sales</text>
  <text start="358.919" dur="6.15">earlier this time now once again from</text>
  <text start="362.31" dur="5.31">the past all this does not work because</text>
  <text start="365.069" dur="4.261">if the people do not have jobs or they</text>
  <text start="367.62" dur="4.019">have part-time jobs where they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="369.33" dur="3.51">find a full-time job where they find a</text>
  <text start="371.639" dur="3.661">full-time job and they&amp;#39;re making less</text>
  <text start="372.84" dur="3.93">money guess what they&amp;#39;re very nervous to</text>
  <text start="375.3" dur="3.69">go out and spend and they spend a lot</text>
  <text start="376.77" dur="5.13">less now on the holidays this is what</text>
  <text start="378.99" dur="5.01">we&amp;#39;ve seen in the past what&amp;#39;s also very</text>
  <text start="381.9" dur="4.5">interesting is that the u.s. mortgage</text>
  <text start="384" dur="5.009">application slipped to their lowest</text>
  <text start="386.4" dur="5.129">since mid February as a 30 year home bar</text>
  <text start="389.009" dur="4.351">and cost rose to ha to their highest in</text>
  <text start="391.529" dur="4.2">three months and this is coming from the</text>
  <text start="393.36" dur="4.14">mortgage bank Association and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="395.729" dur="5.881">saying that the mortgage activity fell</text>
  <text start="397.5" dur="8.789">by 2.6 percent this was the lowest since</text>
  <text start="401.61" dur="6.899">February 17th of this year and we see</text>
  <text start="406.289" dur="2.731">right now as interest rates move up a</text>
  <text start="408.509" dur="3.21">little bit</text>
  <text start="409.02" dur="5.609">guess what it pushes people out of the</text>
  <text start="411.719" dur="5.461">market now if the Fed comes in and they</text>
  <text start="414.629" dur="4.47">start raising rates guess what the</text>
  <text start="417.18" dur="5.009">housing market is doomed this is why</text>
  <text start="419.099" dur="6.54">they&amp;#39;ve done nothing as of yet now to</text>
  <text start="422.189" dur="5.641">convince everyone that the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="425.639" dur="4.411">doing well that we&amp;#39;re recovering what</text>
  <text start="427.83" dur="3.75">they need to do is they need to boo they</text>
  <text start="430.05" dur="3.419">need to manipulate all these different</text>
  <text start="431.58" dur="3.69">numbers like the unemployment the GDP</text>
  <text start="433.469" dur="3.57">everything they can get their hands on</text>
  <text start="435.27" dur="4.679">the stock market and they need to</text>
  <text start="437.039" dur="6.24">convince everyone that all of this is</text>
  <text start="439.949" dur="5.58">absolutely fine and one of the big ways</text>
  <text start="443.279" dur="3.63">to do this is the stock market because</text>
  <text start="445.529" dur="3.12">people are looking at the stock market</text>
  <text start="446.909" dur="4.44">they feel good if the stock market is up</text>
  <text start="448.649" dur="4.48">they feel like everything is perfect in</text>
  <text start="451.349" dur="5.201">the world but</text>
  <text start="453.129" dur="6.93">what have they done to create the</text>
  <text start="456.55" dur="6.359">illusion that everything is fine well in</text>
  <text start="460.059" dur="4.17">the third quarter of 2017 one in which</text>
  <text start="462.909" dur="3.27">the global economy was supposedly</text>
  <text start="464.229" dur="4.68">undergoing in an unprecedented</text>
  <text start="466.179" dur="4.74">coordinated growth spurt in which the</text>
  <text start="468.909" dur="5.37">central banks were preparing to unveil</text>
  <text start="470.919" dur="5.191">their QE tapering intentions and we know</text>
  <text start="474.279" dur="4.29">that the Fed right now they are gonna</text>
  <text start="476.11" dur="4.47">start unwinding it&amp;#39;s a very small bit of</text>
  <text start="478.569" dur="5.761">unwinding they&amp;#39;re doing right now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="480.58" dur="6.269">not even going to affect their their</text>
  <text start="484.33" dur="6.539">whole entire ledger of about four point</text>
  <text start="486.849" dur="6.481">five trillion dollars but when we look</text>
  <text start="490.869" dur="5.34">at this we can see that they need to</text>
  <text start="493.33" dur="6.569">pump up the stock market how did they do</text>
  <text start="496.209" dur="7.23">this well the central banks they went on</text>
  <text start="499.899" dur="5.16">a buying spree and they boosted the</text>
  <text start="503.439" dur="4.25">markets up now this is coming from the</text>
  <text start="505.059" dur="3.81">Swiss central bank and they have</text>
  <text start="507.689" dur="5.97">aggressively</text>
  <text start="508.869" dur="10.71">bought stocks eighty eight billion</text>
  <text start="513.659" dur="8.62">dollars worth of use a US stock so when</text>
  <text start="519.579" dur="4.08">we look at this we can see in the month</text>
  <text start="522.279" dur="5.25">of September</text>
  <text start="523.659" dur="6.751">they added eighty eight billion dollars</text>
  <text start="527.529" dur="5.04">worth of stock in January of 2017</text>
  <text start="530.41" dur="5.64">they bought eighty four billion dollars</text>
  <text start="532.569" dur="6.57">worth of stock now they&amp;#39;re keeping the</text>
  <text start="536.05" dur="6.33">market up and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="539.139" dur="12.05">their first top 20 holdings are as</text>
  <text start="542.38" dur="13.129">follows Apple Microsoft Facebook Amazon</text>
  <text start="551.189" dur="7.75">Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson AT&amp;amp;T Procter &amp;amp; Gamble</text>
  <text start="555.509" dur="6.121">Verizon and you can see that these</text>
  <text start="558.939" dur="6.601">stocks some of them make up the fangs</text>
  <text start="561.63" dur="7.059">they&amp;#39;ve been pumping this up to convince</text>
  <text start="565.54" dur="5.909">everyone that we have recovered and</text>
  <text start="568.689" dur="5.191">they&amp;#39;re creating currency out of thin</text>
  <text start="571.449" dur="4.471">air they&amp;#39;re pumping it into the stock</text>
  <text start="573.88" dur="3.209">market and everyone&amp;#39;s thinking to</text>
  <text start="575.92" dur="3.81">themselves wow look at the stock</text>
  <text start="577.089" dur="4.44">market&amp;#39;s going up well the stock</text>
  <text start="579.73" dur="3.959">market&amp;#39;s not going up because people are</text>
  <text start="581.529" dur="3.601">like oh let me get that stock let me</text>
  <text start="583.689" dur="3.4">look at the revenue of the corporation</text>
  <text start="585.13" dur="4.089">wow they&amp;#39;re doing great in sales</text>
  <text start="587.089" dur="3.63">so I have to buy their stock know what</text>
  <text start="589.219" dur="4.07">the central bank is doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="590.719" dur="5.7">creating currency out of thin air and</text>
  <text start="593.289" dur="5.05">they&amp;#39;re buying up the stock I mean think</text>
  <text start="596.419" dur="4.83">about it if you could sit in your home</text>
  <text start="598.339" dur="4.47">and just create currency out of thin air</text>
  <text start="601.249" dur="5.28">and just buy stocks</text>
  <text start="602.809" dur="6.03">is that real No</text>
  <text start="606.529" dur="6.81">so let&amp;#39;s think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="608.839" dur="6.3">if we remove the 88 billion that they</text>
  <text start="613.339" dur="4.53">spent in September from the stock market</text>
  <text start="615.139" dur="5.21">and I made a mistake it wasn&amp;#39;t January</text>
  <text start="617.869" dur="4.95">of 2017 it was June of 2017 when they</text>
  <text start="620.349" dur="3.01">purchased 84 billion dollars so if we</text>
  <text start="622.819" dur="4.88">removed</text>
  <text start="623.359" dur="8.67">84 billion dollars in June if we remove</text>
  <text start="627.699" dur="8.2">80 billion in March of this year</text>
  <text start="632.029" dur="7.53">if we remove 63 billion in December of</text>
  <text start="635.899" dur="5.58">2016 and this goes all the way back to</text>
  <text start="639.559" dur="4.35">2014 when they started to purchase these</text>
  <text start="641.479" dur="6.27">stocks so we&amp;#39;re going from 2014 all the</text>
  <text start="643.909" dur="7.71">way up to the seventh 2017 I mean we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="647.749" dur="8.4">talking about almost a trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="651.619" dur="9.3">shoved into the stock market to pump</text>
  <text start="656.149" dur="7.17">this up and if you notice and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="660.919" dur="4.64">looking at this graph the amount that</text>
  <text start="663.319" dur="4.56">they have to spend each time is</text>
  <text start="665.559" dur="4.87">increasing because if we go back to</text>
  <text start="667.879" dur="5.31">let&amp;#39;s say June of 2016</text>
  <text start="670.429" dur="5.52">it was 61 billion then in September of</text>
