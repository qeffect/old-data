  <text start="41.43" dur="5.37">is the current economic collapse news</text>
  <text start="43.92" dur="5.19">brief let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="46.8" dur="5.25">collapse news i hope everyone had a</text>
  <text start="49.11" dur="8.519">happy and healthy new year this is the</text>
  <text start="52.05" dur="7.62">first x22 report of 2016 and we have</text>
  <text start="57.629" dur="5.941">been looking at the economy we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="59.67" dur="6.48">diving deep into the economic indicators</text>
  <text start="63.57" dur="6.15">and we looked at trucking in the last</text>
  <text start="66.15" dur="6.12">report about how the trucking has been</text>
  <text start="69.72" dur="5.34">declining and we&amp;#39;re starting to realize</text>
  <text start="72.27" dur="5.09">that retailers declining manufacturing</text>
  <text start="75.06" dur="4.86">is declining the delivery operations</text>
  <text start="77.36" dur="5.619">they are declining and when we look at</text>
  <text start="79.92" dur="5.28">rail traffic we see that the association</text>
  <text start="82.979" dur="5.701">of american railway they post a free</text>
  <text start="85.2" dur="5.64">report on rail volumes where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="88.68" dur="5.13">transporting all different types of</text>
  <text start="90.84" dur="6.75">things across North America and this</text>
  <text start="93.81" dur="6.51">will give us some clues in what how the</text>
  <text start="97.59" dur="5.88">economy is actually doing in real time</text>
  <text start="100.32" dur="8.28">and the latest report will basically</text>
  <text start="103.47" dur="8.46">give us some insight on the 2015 economy</text>
  <text start="108.6" dur="6.48">and when we look at the rail traffic we</text>
  <text start="111.93" dur="7.17">see in the year of 2015 we&amp;#39;ve gone</text>
  <text start="115.08" dur="8.49">negative now if we go back to 2006</text>
  <text start="119.1" dur="7.22">moving forward we see rail traffic was</text>
  <text start="123.57" dur="7.37">in the negative range starting back in</text>
  <text start="126.32" dur="7.57">2006 the end of 2006 going through 2007</text>
  <text start="130.94" dur="6.579">going really negative in two thousand</text>
  <text start="133.89" dur="5.61">eight and nine then it pumped back up as</text>
  <text start="137.519" dur="4.25">soon as the Fed started to create free</text>
  <text start="139.5" dur="5.459">money which was quantitative easing and</text>
  <text start="141.769" dur="8.05">this has been an up-and-down type of</text>
  <text start="144.959" dur="7.98">scenario all throughout 2009 all the way</text>
  <text start="149.819" dur="4.681">up to 2014 but in the year of 2015 we</text>
  <text start="152.939" dur="4.351">are starting to see the same signs that</text>
  <text start="154.5" dur="5.069">we saw back in two thousand seven where</text>
  <text start="157.29" dur="6.44">we&amp;#39;re seeing many many months in a row</text>
  <text start="159.569" dur="6.291">with negative rail traffic</text>
  <text start="163.73" dur="3.6">and if we look at forest products which</text>
  <text start="165.86" dur="3.39">includes lumber which is a major</text>
  <text start="167.33" dur="7.23">component of house construction in the</text>
  <text start="169.25" dur="8.39">u.s. we see that lumber deliveries have</text>
  <text start="174.56" dur="8.19">completely fallen off the charts and</text>
  <text start="177.64" dur="10.39">they&amp;#39;re declining which tells us that</text>
  <text start="182.75" dur="7.23">the housing sector is declining now they</text>
  <text start="188.03" dur="4.19">can manipulate the numbers any way they</text>
  <text start="189.98" dur="5.009">want they can manipulate everything</text>
  <text start="192.22" dur="5.109">however they want but when we look at</text>
  <text start="194.989" dur="3.931">the actual lumber deliveries for new</text>
  <text start="197.329" dur="3.901">construction and they continually try to</text>
  <text start="198.92" dur="5.429">tell us that new construction is getting</text>
  <text start="201.23" dur="5.039">better and better of course this last</text>
  <text start="204.349" dur="3.661">report we see a decline we see a decline</text>
  <text start="206.269" dur="5.161">in existing home sales we see a decline</text>
  <text start="208.01" dur="4.92">in pending home sales we see a little</text>
  <text start="211.43" dur="4.589">bit of a decline in new construction but</text>
  <text start="212.93" dur="6.41">lumber for some reason we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="216.019" dur="6.481">the volume have fallen off the chart</text>
  <text start="219.34" dur="7.209">which tells us that they&amp;#39;re manipulating</text>
  <text start="222.5" dur="8.37">these numbers and we notice that lumber</text>
  <text start="226.549" dur="8.491">prices are continually declining and the</text>
  <text start="230.87" dur="6.36">demand for lumber is also declining so</text>
  <text start="235.04" dur="5.55">when we look at the economy we can see</text>
  <text start="237.23" dur="6.27">that the economy is starting to fall</text>
  <text start="240.59" dur="5.67">apart and it&amp;#39;s rapidly falling apart and</text>
  <text start="243.5" dur="4.5">no matter how they make it look it</text>
  <text start="246.26" dur="3.9">doesn&amp;#39;t really matter because in the end</text>
  <text start="248" dur="6.18">this whole thing is going to crumble</text>
  <text start="250.16" dur="6.24">around them we see that the u.s. mint</text>
  <text start="254.18" dur="5.19">there&amp;#39;s silver coin sales they&amp;#39;ve hit a</text>
  <text start="256.4" dur="5.88">record in 2015 gold sales were up fifty</text>
  <text start="259.37" dur="5.01">three percent and people are getting</text>
  <text start="262.28" dur="4.74">very nervous they realize the economy is</text>
  <text start="264.38" dur="5.159">not doing well and they&amp;#39;re purchasing</text>
  <text start="267.02" dur="4.11">precious metals no matter how the</text>
  <text start="269.539" dur="5.341">precious metals are continually</text>
  <text start="271.13" dur="6.83">suppressed people realize that is the</text>
  <text start="274.88" dur="5.219">real money the paper currency is</text>
  <text start="277.96" dur="5.56">absolutely meaningless because when it</text>
  <text start="280.099" dur="9.261">comes down to it you need the gold you</text>
  <text start="283.52" dur="11.04">need the silver and case in point I have</text>
  <text start="289.36" dur="8.66">currencies from Germany I have</text>
  <text start="294.56" dur="6.16">currencies from Austria and guess what</text>
  <text start="298.02" dur="6.209">they&amp;#39;re completely worthless I offer I</text>
  <text start="300.72" dur="6.689">also have silver coins from that time</text>
  <text start="304.229" dur="6.451">period and those are still worth</text>
  <text start="307.409" dur="6.51">something and that shows you that the</text>
  <text start="310.68" dur="8.639">silver and the gold they retain their</text>
  <text start="313.919" dur="6.78">value we see that JPMorgan Chase they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="319.319" dur="4.44">saying now that there&amp;#39;s a possibility</text>
  <text start="320.699" dur="5.46">that the US economy is going to slow</text>
  <text start="323.759" dur="4.771">down over the course of the next few</text>
  <text start="326.159" dur="4.681">years and what they&amp;#39;re saying is that</text>
  <text start="328.53" dur="3.569">the US economy is going to slow down</text>
  <text start="330.84" dur="5.449">over the course of the next few years</text>
  <text start="332.099" dur="6.211">and their probability has surged by 75%</text>
  <text start="336.289" dur="4.301">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="338.31" dur="4.47">trying to prime the American people to</text>
  <text start="340.59" dur="3.9">let everyone know that this year the</text>
  <text start="342.78" dur="4.77">economy is going to start to fall apart</text>
  <text start="344.49" dur="5.13">the IMF is also predicting a slowing</text>
  <text start="347.55" dur="4.169">economy which tells you whatever they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="349.62" dur="9.019">saying is going to be about 10 to 20</text>
  <text start="351.719" dur="9.51">times worse we see in Portugal that the</text>
  <text start="358.639" dur="6.011">Portuguese central bank they release</text>
  <text start="361.229" dur="5.011">their results of its banks and basically</text>
  <text start="364.65" dur="3.419">virtually of all the country&amp;#39;s banks</text>
  <text start="366.24" dur="4.859">they&amp;#39;re going to have to boost their</text>
  <text start="368.069" dur="6.511">tier 1 ratios by point two five percent</text>
  <text start="371.099" dur="5.88">to one percent before January of 2017</text>
  <text start="374.58" dur="4.709">now the central bank released these</text>
  <text start="376.979" dur="4.111">results between christmas and new years</text>
  <text start="379.289" dur="4.38">when the trading desks in europe are</text>
  <text start="381.09" dur="4.859">virtually empty and what&amp;#39;s very odd</text>
  <text start="383.669" dur="5.521">about what this data that they released</text>
  <text start="385.949" dur="6.451">is that they release the data with</text>
  <text start="389.19" dur="5.879">percentages and not the absolute capital</text>
  <text start="392.4" dur="5.34">needed which is very suspicious in</text>
  <text start="395.069" dur="4.981">itself and we know that all these ECB</text>
  <text start="397.74" dur="4.289">stress tests and the Fed stress tests on</text>
  <text start="400.05" dur="5.01">the banks we know that all of this is a</text>
  <text start="402.029" dur="6.39">complete sham we know these banks are</text>
  <text start="405.06" dur="5.609">completely ripe to completely fail</text>
  <text start="408.419" dur="4.231">because we know that they&amp;#39;re pushing the</text>
  <text start="410.669" dur="5.31">beylin documents we know they go into</text>
  <text start="412.65" dur="4.889">effect January first of 2016 we know</text>
  <text start="415.979" dur="4.981">that Europe is putting pushing other</text>
  <text start="417.539" dur="5.88">nations to get these banks on the ballon</text>
  <text start="420.96" dur="4.62">documents we know that the UK the United</text>
  <text start="423.419" dur="5.521">States Canada and many other countries</text>
  <text start="425.58" dur="6.389">all have the Ballon documents ready to</text>
  <text start="428.94" dur="4.829">go because we know in the end</text>
  <text start="431.969" dur="5.04">basically they&amp;#39;re going to go inside to</text>
  <text start="433.769" dur="7.74">the banks and take the people&amp;#39;s money to</text>
  <text start="437.009" dur="8.01">save the banks now Obama is moving his</text>
  <text start="441.509" dur="6.42">gun control efforts fast forward ahead</text>
  <text start="445.019" dur="8.03">this year he says this is his main goal</text>
  <text start="447.929" dur="7.74">and basically he is going to direct</text>
  <text start="453.049" dur="5.34">administration officials to explore any</text>
  <text start="455.669" dur="6.84">steps he could take on guns without</text>
  <text start="458.389" dur="5.4">lawmakers help and basically what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="462.509" dur="4.14">going to do he&amp;#39;s going to sit down with</text>
  <text start="463.789" dur="4.27">miss Lynch they&amp;#39;re going to discuss</text>
  <text start="466.649" dur="3.66">their options they&amp;#39;re going to draft</text>
  <text start="468.059" dur="4.28">executive orders and remember the</text>
  <text start="470.309" dur="6.301">executive orders pertained to the</text>
  <text start="472.339" dur="6.4">executive branch and those agencies that</text>
  <text start="476.61" dur="6">report to the executive branch and the</text>
  <text start="478.739" dur="6.66">executive actions that he creates do not</text>
  <text start="482.61" dur="6">affect the American people the American</text>
  <text start="485.399" dur="4.32">people do not have to abide by this but</text>
  <text start="488.61" dur="3.329">of course he&amp;#39;s trying to convince</text>
  <text start="489.719" dur="5.34">everyone that once he&amp;#39;s does this this</text>
  <text start="491.939" dur="5.19">is law these are not laws whatsoever but</text>
  <text start="495.059" dur="4.47">one executive action that will almost</text>
  <text start="497.129" dur="4.8">certainly be unveiled is that tightening</text>
  <text start="499.529" dur="4.91">of rules for firearms sellers by</text>
  <text start="501.929" dur="5.01">requiring more of them to be licensed</text>
  <text start="504.439" dur="5.62">licensed as a result to conduct</text>
  <text start="506.939" dur="4.83">background checks on buyers and many gun</text>
  <text start="510.059" dur="3.811">right groups already have signaled</text>
  <text start="511.769" dur="4.71">opposition to new rules for private</text>
  <text start="513.87" dur="4.769">sellers and an expansion of background</text>
  <text start="516.479" dur="3.96">checks and they have questioned whether</text>
  <text start="518.639" dur="4.92">mr. Obama has legal authority to act</text>
  <text start="520.439" dur="5.7">unilaterally in this type of decision</text>
  <text start="523.559" dur="4.861">the National Rifle Association is out</text>
  <text start="526.139" dur="4.05">there saying listen from all the</text>
  <text start="528.42" dur="4.169">research on the high-profile mass</text>
  <text start="530.189" dur="4.801">shootings they said that most of the</text>
  <text start="532.589" dur="5.461">firearms were not bought by private</text>
  <text start="534.99" dur="5.94">sellers they were stolen from someone</text>
  <text start="538.05" dur="7.769">else so all these executive actions and</text>
  <text start="540.93" dur="7.11">we&amp;#39;ve proven before that if they had all</text>
  <text start="545.819" dur="4.861">these executive actions and all these</text>
  <text start="548.04" dur="4.5">laws on the books would have stopped any</text>
  <text start="550.68" dur="5.879">of these false flag events no it</text>
  <text start="552.54" dur="5.25">wouldn&amp;#39;t have and if these were real it</text>
  <text start="556.559" dur="3.301">wouldn&amp;#39;t have stopped it but we know</text>
  <text start="557.79" dur="4.349">they were false flag events and we can</text>
  <text start="559.86" dur="5.7">see right now the only reason they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="562.139" dur="5.581">doing this is to affect the every</text>
  <text start="565.56" dur="4.02">day person not the criminals the</text>
  <text start="567.72" dur="3.84">criminals go to the black market the</text>
  <text start="569.58" dur="4.83">criminals don&amp;#39;t get fingerprinted they</text>
  <text start="571.56" dur="6">don&amp;#39;t wait the five days it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="574.41" dur="6">like a drug dealer and someone who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="577.56" dur="7.14">looking to get drugs where do they go to</text>
  <text start="580.41" dur="7.29">get them right they&amp;#39;re going to the</text>
  <text start="584.7" dur="6.06">black market they&amp;#39;re going to a place</text>
  <text start="587.7" dur="5.66">where the government has no reach the</text>
  <text start="590.76" dur="5.88">only reach is on the everyday person</text>
  <text start="593.36" dur="6.46">prohibition the everyday person could</text>
  <text start="596.64" dur="6.03">not get alcohol if you went to the black</text>
  <text start="599.82" dur="7.2">market or politicians they had the</text>
  <text start="602.67" dur="6.66">alcohol so all of this is meant to it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="607.02" dur="6.54">meant to keep the weapons out of the</text>
  <text start="609.33" dur="7.5">hands of the everyday person now in</text>
  <text start="613.56" dur="4.77">Texas we see that adults with proper</text>
  <text start="616.83" dur="3.84">permits no longer need to hide the</text>
  <text start="618.33" dur="6.18">handguns they carry in their shoulder or</text>
  <text start="620.67" dur="6.45">belt holders holsters and this is under</text>
  <text start="624.51" dur="5.43">the new open carry law making guns more</text>
  <text start="627.12" dur="6.24">visible and they&amp;#39;re saying that by doing</text>
  <text start="629.94" dur="4.92">this it will deter mass shootings now of</text>
  <text start="633.36" dur="4.16">course not everyone is happy about this</text>
  <text start="634.86" dur="6.57">but I can see their point if you see</text>
  <text start="637.52" dur="5.65">everyone wearing a weapon a mass shooter</text>
  <text start="641.43" dur="4.62">is going to think twice before going</text>
  <text start="643.17" dur="5.85">into a theater into a store shooting up</text>
  <text start="646.05" dur="7.47">the place because in about 2.5 seconds</text>
  <text start="649.02" dur="6.9">they will end up dead now in Oregon we</text>
  <text start="653.52" dur="4.19">see Nevada rancher cliven Bundy and his</text>
  <text start="655.92" dur="4.38">three sons in about 150 militiamen</text>
  <text start="657.71" dur="5.89">they&amp;#39;ve occupied the National Wildlife</text>
  <text start="660.3" dur="5.1">Refuge headquarters to protest the</text>
  <text start="663.6" dur="6.21">penning imprisonment of to Oregon</text>
  <text start="665.4" dur="5.7">ranchers accused of arson and basically</text>
  <text start="669.81" dur="3.86">they&amp;#39;re arguing the federal government</text>
  <text start="671.1" dur="5.46">has no authority in local cases and</text>
  <text start="673.67" dur="6.09">basically what they did is that ranchers</text>
  <text start="676.56" dur="5.34">use fire in Eastern Oregon to burn</text>
  <text start="679.76" dur="4.93">different species that are giving them</text>
  <text start="681.9" dur="4.98">problems around the area and sometimes</text>
  <text start="684.69" dur="7.589">it gets out of hands and sometimes the</text>
  <text start="686.88" dur="8.01">fires they spread and looks like this is</text>
  <text start="692.279" dur="5.43">what happened so basically did they</text>
  <text start="694.89" dur="4.62">really commit arson I don&amp;#39;t know but</text>
  <text start="697.709" dur="5.191">under this long</text>
  <text start="699.51" dur="9.84">back in 1996 they&amp;#39;re trying to punish</text>
  <text start="702.9" dur="8.64">them under domestic terrorists and this</text>
  <text start="709.35" dur="5.78">is how they&amp;#39;re trying to spin the entire</text>
  <text start="711.54" dur="6.69">thing so basically they&amp;#39;re protesting</text>
  <text start="715.13" dur="6.34">cliven Bundy and his sons in front of</text>
  <text start="718.23" dur="6">the headquarters they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="721.47" dur="4.8">these people are not guilty of this this</text>
  <text start="724.23" dur="3.66">is something that we always do and it</text>
  <text start="726.27" dur="5.1">looks like the federal government is</text>

  <text start="873.21" dur="3.87">look like this is the new narrative for</text>
  <text start="875.88" dur="4.92">the United States because as we know</text>
  <text start="877.08" dur="7.68">Saudi Arabia takes its orders from the</text>

  <text start="887.43" dur="6.21">and they were trying to calm everyone</text>
  <text start="890.07" dur="6.99">down and basically what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="893.64" dur="7.86">right now is they&amp;#39;re trying to create an</text>
  <text start="897.06" dur="7.5">instant incident inside of a ram so we</text>
  <text start="901.5" dur="4.68">already see protests Saudi Arabia was</text>
  <text start="904.56" dur="4.16">instructed to do this because they knew</text>
  <text start="906.18" dur="5.64">this was going to cause problems in Iran</text>
  <text start="908.72" dur="6.22">we see the white house right now wanting</text>
  <text start="911.82" dur="6.69">to impose sanctions but having</text>
  <text start="914.94" dur="6.06">difficulty in doing so because what Iran</text>
  <text start="918.51" dur="4.83">was doing was in the framework of the p5</text>
  <text start="921" dur="6.39">plus one deal but we can see right now</text>
  <text start="923.34" dur="6.18">that the White House will breach the p5</text>
  <text start="927.39" dur="5.73">plus one deal this is their main goal</text>
  <text start="929.52" dur="5.55">right now and they&amp;#39;ll eventually do this</text>
  <text start="933.12" dur="4.82">and right now we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="935.07" dur="4.95">being moved the agenda is being moved</text>
  <text start="937.94" dur="4.93">forward because we&amp;#39;re seeing that the</text>
  <text start="940.02" dur="6.09">Saudi Iranian conflict basically is</text>
  <text start="942.87" dur="5.52">going to explode EU is already warning</text>

  <text start="948.39" dur="7.82">tension risks in the Syrian peace deal</text>
  <text start="951.96" dur="7.97">and basically they&amp;#39;re warning that</text>
  <text start="956.21" dur="8.14">renewed tensions between Shiites and</text>
  <text start="959.93" dur="6.88">Sunnis might wreck the efforts that are</text>
  <text start="964.35" dur="3.84">going on in Syria so</text>
  <text start="966.81" dur="5.43">you can see what they&amp;#39;re planning right</text>
  <text start="968.19" dur="6.74">now they&amp;#39;re planning on going after Iran</text>
  <text start="972.24" dur="6.78">they&amp;#39;re planning on creating chaos</text>
  <text start="974.93" dur="8.29">between the Shiites and the Sunnis all</text>
  <text start="979.02" dur="8.85">of this is being done right now to</text>
  <text start="983.22" dur="8.91">create war in this area because they</text>
  <text start="987.87" dur="7.26">know it will be completely impossible to</text>
  <text start="992.13" dur="6.12">fight Russia in Syria and the next step</text>
  <text start="995.13" dur="7.47">at this point is try to go after I ran</text>
  <text start="998.25" dur="7.92">the prize deal and then vet maybe later</text>
  <text start="1002.6" dur="7.17">go after Syria and if war breaks out</text>
  <text start="1006.17" dur="7.71">with Russia and China and North Korea</text>
  <text start="1009.77" dur="6.509">and Iran and Syria so be it because we</text>
  <text start="1013.88" dur="5.64">see already that Saudi Arabia they have</text>
  <text start="1016.279" dur="6.841">cut diplomatic ties with Iran over the</text>
  <text start="1019.52" dur="7.74">embassy storming now I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="1023.12" dur="7.23">surprised inside Iran if the little riot</text>
  <text start="1027.26" dur="6.689">that was going on in there was kind of</text>
  <text start="1030.35" dur="6.719">ginned up by agent provocateurs trying</text>
  <text start="1033.949" dur="5.101">to push the agenda forward we see</text>
  <text start="1037.069" dur="7.86">already that Saudi Arabia has says this</text>
  <text start="1039.05" dur="7.62">ceasefire in Yemen it is now ended of</text>
