  <text start="356.45" dur="5.52">thousand jobs which is a gain in January</text>
  <text start="360.62" dur="3.33">when they expected about a hundred</text>

  <text start="380.15" dur="9.75">which is very interesting we see right</text>
  <text start="384.47" dur="7.28">now this might be a huge warning gen2</text>
  <text start="389.9" dur="5.67">this is coming from Deutsche Bank</text>
  <text start="391.75" dur="6.57">they&amp;#39;re saying that GE might be kicked</text>
  <text start="395.57" dur="7.7">out of the Dow now we need to remember</text>
  <text start="398.32" dur="7.81">ge is one of the original industrial</text>
  <text start="403.27" dur="8.11">founding members which has been in the</text>
  <text start="406.13" dur="7.26">index since 1907 General Electric has</text>
  <text start="411.38" dur="5.28">been an original component of the Dow</text>
  <text start="413.39" dur="6.99">Jones Industrial Average which was</text>
  <text start="416.66" dur="6.18">invented by Charles Dow in 1896 for over</text>
  <text start="420.38" dur="5.25">a hundred and ten years I mean it may</text>
  <text start="422.84" dur="5.19">not be there for long however in a note</text>
  <text start="425.63" dur="4.41">from Deutsche Bank&amp;#39;s John inch the</text>
  <text start="428.03" dur="4.17">analyst writes that he believes the</text>
  <text start="430.04" dur="4.95">chances that GE could be removed from</text>
  <text start="432.2" dur="5.22">the Dow are increasing as GE continues</text>
  <text start="434.99" dur="5.37">to face substantial challenges including</text>

  <text start="447.8" dur="6.35">and SEC investigations and this is how</text>
  <text start="452.45" dur="4.7">they&amp;#39;re saying it could take place</text>
  <text start="454.15" dur="7.46">the Dow is managed by a committee that</text>
  <text start="457.15" dur="7.11">means twice a year in secret to review</text>
  <text start="461.61" dur="5.47">all the different component companies</text>
  <text start="464.26" dur="5.82">the index is intended to represent the</text>
  <text start="467.08" dur="5.13">best large companies in the US the index</text>
  <text start="470.08" dur="4.53">is not market cap weighted but weighted</text>
  <text start="472.21" dur="5.01">by absolute share price consequently</text>
  <text start="474.61" dur="4.17">apart from GES other challenges as the</text>

  <text start="478.78" dur="6.68">continued to drop GE increasingly falls</text>
  <text start="483.04" dur="4.62">into the category of outlier and</text>
  <text start="485.46" dur="6.04">consequently a likely candidate for</text>
  <text start="487.66" dur="6.569">removal we believe headline risk to be</text>
  <text start="491.5" dur="5.55">most significant risk factor if GE were</text>
  <text start="494.229" dur="7.621">to be dropped from the Dow and this is a</text>
  <text start="497.05" dur="8.82">sure sign that something is about to</text>
  <text start="501.85" dur="8.039">happen this might trigger something to</text>
  <text start="505.87" dur="6.479">happen in the market and this is an</text>
  <text start="509.889" dur="5.7">indicator letting us know that all of</text>
  <text start="512.349" dur="6.601">these companies they&amp;#39;re all propped up</text>

  <text start="538.089" dur="6.271">see all these together it&amp;#39;s all dropping</text>
  <text start="540.79" dur="7.44">at the same exact time meanwhile what</text>
  <text start="544.36" dur="8.61">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the national debt</text>

  <text start="835.97" dur="5.37">correct we don&amp;#39;t know but what we do</text>
  <text start="837.95" dur="5.76">know is that when we take a look around</text>
  <text start="841.34" dur="5.52">the world we take a look at what is</text>
  <text start="843.71" dur="6.21">happening we can see there are many</text>
  <text start="846.86" dur="6.09">different forces at play it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="849.92" dur="5.52">the economy it has to do with many</text>
  <text start="852.95" dur="4.11">different factors it has to do</text>
  <text start="855.44" dur="4.11">with the petrodollar in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="857.06" dur="4.649">and their plan to control the Middle</text>
  <text start="859.55" dur="5.37">East and to prop the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="861.709" dur="6.961">up because that is the basis of the</text>
  <text start="864.92" dur="5.76">entire system as we can see well</text>
  <text start="868.67" dur="4.529">there&amp;#39;s problems in the Middle East all</text>
  <text start="870.68" dur="5.459">their plans didn&amp;#39;t go as planned</text>
  <text start="873.199" dur="5.19">and right now countries are looking to</text>
  <text start="876.139" dur="4.771">move away from the petrodollar that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="878.389" dur="6.831">number one that feeds back into the</text>
  <text start="880.91" dur="7.919">economy we all already know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="885.22" dur="5.44">they&amp;#39;re planning for a weaker dollar we</text>
  <text start="888.829" dur="3.961">see the dollar is declining very very</text>
  <text start="890.66" dur="4.5">rapidly and they nudge it along by</text>
  <text start="892.79" dur="4.859">making an announcement you know again</text>
  <text start="895.16" dur="4.469">the world heard this and even though you</text>
  <text start="897.649" dur="4.201">cover it up later saying no no we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="899.629" dur="3.69">want a weaker dollar it&amp;#39;s still out</text>
  <text start="901.85" dur="4.02">there and they can see the dollar</text>
  <text start="903.319" dur="5.401">declining so countries look at this and</text>
  <text start="905.87" dur="5.67">say whoa hold on here this is not a good</text>
  <text start="908.72" dur="5.219">thing we understand there&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="911.54" dur="4.469">agreements between different central</text>
  <text start="913.939" dur="4.89">banks different countries saying that</text>
  <text start="916.009" dur="8.94">the United States wouldn&amp;#39;t weaken the</text>
  <text start="918.829" dur="9.18">dollar it was written and agreed upon we</text>
  <text start="924.949" dur="6.351">also understand that there are other</text>
  <text start="928.009" dur="6.841">things happening within government and</text>
  <text start="931.3" dur="8.35">all of this ties into the same exact</text>
  <text start="934.85" dur="7.38">thing how do you distract the public</text>
  <text start="939.65" dur="6.09">well you can do many different things</text>
  <text start="942.23" dur="6.12">you can have events you can crash the</text>
  <text start="945.74" dur="4.59">economy I mean think about it if the</text>
  <text start="948.35" dur="3.63">economy and the stock market came out</text>
  <text start="950.33" dur="5.64">just maybe just a small correction maybe</text>
  <text start="951.98" dur="6.69">it came down 10% 20% or so that would</text>
  <text start="955.97" dur="4.44">fill the airwaves for quite a while I</text>
  <text start="958.67" dur="4.32">mean if they can if they bring it down</text>
  <text start="960.41" dur="5.79">even further it would clear the airwaves</text>
  <text start="962.99" dur="5.94">for quite a while and companies then</text>
  <text start="966.2" dur="5.01">would say okay hold on here the market</text>
  <text start="968.93" dur="4.409">came down maybe didn&amp;#39;t go back up maybe</text>
  <text start="971.21" dur="3.81">it stayed at that level they would start</text>
  <text start="973.339" dur="4.761">making the case of why they needed to</text>
  <text start="975.02" dur="8.009">layoff individuals just like they did</text>
  <text start="978.1" dur="6.7">back in 2008 and income peas made</text>
  <text start="983.029" dur="4.531">announcement how they&amp;#39;re downsizing and</text>
  <text start="984.8" dur="5.19">the same thing could occur that would be</text>
  <text start="987.56" dur="4.95">a huge distraction of course they can</text>
  <text start="989.99" dur="6.03">have other events but we can see all of</text>
  <text start="992.51" dur="8.46">this is tying in to the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="996.02" dur="8.7">now we know the system cannot continue</text>
  <text start="1000.97" dur="6.869">on it&amp;#39;s built on lies illusion just like</text>
  <text start="1004.72" dur="4.83">Enron just like back in 2008 when they</text>
  <text start="1007.839" dur="3.69">told us you know the subprime securities</text>
  <text start="1009.55" dur="5.7">triple-a everything&amp;#39;s contained and all</text>
  <text start="1011.529" dur="5.371">this other stuff all of its fake I mean</text>
  <text start="1015.25" dur="3.029">no one believes it&amp;#39;s fake until it</text>
  <text start="1016.9" dur="3.57">crashes and then people start looking</text>
  <text start="1018.279" dur="4.591">back going oh yeah look what they did</text>
  <text start="1020.47" dur="5.91">then they start believing but it&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="1022.87" dur="4.86">late then you already lost because you</text>
  <text start="1026.38" dur="3.87">didn&amp;#39;t believe in the first place that</text>
  <text start="1027.73" dur="4.44">it was fake when you believe after it</text>
  <text start="1030.25" dur="3.809">crashes it&amp;#39;s fake what are you gonna do</text>
  <text start="1032.17" dur="4.139">what are you gonna go buy gold buy</text>
  <text start="1034.059" dur="4.65">Kryptos we&amp;#39;re gonna stock up on food</text>
  <text start="1036.309" dur="4.921">it&amp;#39;s gonna be impossible it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="1038.709" dur="4.411">like the storm is over you the hurricane</text>
  <text start="1041.23" dur="3.63">hit and you say you know what maybe I</text>
  <text start="1043.12" dur="3.42">should go out and get batteries and the</text>
  <text start="1044.86" dur="4.56">hundred and ten mile an hour winds I</text>
  <text start="1046.54" dur="5.4">know my electric went out I should go to</text>
  <text start="1049.42" dur="5.61">the store now it&amp;#39;s too late you can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="1051.94" dur="5.369">it and we can see right now this is</text>
  <text start="1055.03" dur="5.55">where we are headed we are headed in</text>
  <text start="1057.309" dur="6.631">this direction we&amp;#39;re headed in a time</text>
  <text start="1060.58" dur="6.36">period where they&amp;#39;re going to have some</text>
  <text start="1063.94" dur="5.43">type of distraction and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1066.94" dur="5.22">include the economy because it cannot be</text>
  <text start="1069.37" dur="3.9">sustained it&amp;#39;s going to include other</text>
  <text start="1072.16" dur="3.24">events</text>
  <text start="1073.27" dur="5.4">and it&amp;#39;s all gonna happen all at once</text>

  <text start="1086.32" dur="6.33">landing or something so bad and so hard</text>
  <text start="1089.67" dur="5.17">that people will not know what to do</text>
  <text start="1092.65" dur="4.65">there&amp;#39;ll be riots in the street people</text>
  <text start="1094.84" dur="5.4">will be running to the markets if we</text>
  <text start="1097.3" dur="5.01">have the other scenario it&amp;#39;ll be a</text>
  <text start="1100.24" dur="4.83">little bit easier you&amp;#39;ll still go</text>
  <text start="1102.31" dur="5.58">through a transition but both of these</text>
  <text start="1105.07" dur="5.85">versions are being done by different</text>
  <text start="1107.89" dur="5.64">groups one by the Trump administration</text>
