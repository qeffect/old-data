  <text start="127.68" dur="6.48">can see it happening right in front of</text>
  <text start="129.33" dur="7.739">our eyes and another sign that things</text>
  <text start="134.16" dur="4.56">are not going well in the economy they</text>
  <text start="137.069" dur="3.331">keep telling us that unemployment&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="138.72" dur="2.24">getting better they they&amp;#39;re showing us</text>
  <text start="140.4" dur="2.75">on</text>
  <text start="140.96" dur="4.23">is continually going down and we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="143.15" dur="5.37">the seven percent range right now and</text>
  <text start="145.19" dur="6.63">and if we go back in time you know back</text>
  <text start="148.52" dur="5.37">in the 80s we saw unemployment much</text>
  <text start="151.82" dur="4.92">higher than seven percent but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="153.89" dur="5.61">interesting here is that President Obama</text>
  <text start="156.74" dur="5.79">came out yesterday saying that he wants</text>
  <text start="159.5" dur="5.7">to extend the emergency unemployment</text>
  <text start="162.53" dur="5.13">again for 2014 because we have to</text>
  <text start="165.2" dur="5.1">remember i reported this on two or three</text>
  <text start="167.66" dur="5.82">reports back that come this december</text>
  <text start="170.3" dur="4.71">28th it was reported that 1.3 million</text>
  <text start="173.48" dur="4.5">people are going to lose their</text>
  <text start="175.01" dur="5.1">unemployment well they just up that 22</text>
  <text start="177.98" dur="4.98">million people are going to lose their</text>
  <text start="180.11" dur="5.46">unemployment benefits come this December</text>
  <text start="182.96" dur="7.38">and they want to extend this because</text>
  <text start="185.57" dur="7.56">they believe that the unemployment arena</text>
  <text start="190.34" dur="4.8">the job situation is not as strong as</text>
  <text start="193.13" dur="3.84">they would like it and it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="195.14" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re using manipulated numbers and</text>
  <text start="196.97" dur="4.53">this is why they really need to extend</text>
  <text start="198.98" dur="5.01">the unemployment because we&amp;#39;ve been in</text>
  <text start="201.5" dur="6">the seven percent range many many many</text>
  <text start="203.99" dur="5.64">many times throughout the years and if</text>
  <text start="207.5" dur="4.74">you look back it was in the 70s it was</text>
  <text start="209.63" dur="4.65">in the 80s it was in the 90s and they</text>
  <text start="212.24" dur="5.28">did not continually extend unemployment</text>
  <text start="214.28" dur="5.66">like they are now and why this is</text>
  <text start="217.52" dur="5.4">happening is because now they are using</text>
  <text start="219.94" dur="5.8">manipulated numbers and the real numbers</text>
  <text start="222.92" dur="5.4">are showing that unemployment is</text>
  <text start="225.74" dur="4.44">reaching twenty-five percent so they</text>
  <text start="228.32" dur="4.68">need to keep the masses happy right now</text>
  <text start="230.18" dur="6.12">so what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re is they</text>
  <text start="233" dur="5.25">want to issue unemployment again and of</text>
  <text start="236.3" dur="4.2">course this will help those people who</text>
  <text start="238.25" dur="4.32">really can&amp;#39;t find a job because there</text>
  <text start="240.5" dur="4.2">are none out there and I know many many</text>
  <text start="242.57" dur="5.04">people who are in different industries</text>
  <text start="244.7" dur="4.77">that having a very tough time finding</text>
  <text start="247.61" dur="3.6">work I mean everything was great in they</text>
  <text start="249.47" dur="3.96">were in their full-time job making a</text>
  <text start="251.21" dur="4.41">good living and all of a sudden they</text>
  <text start="253.43" dur="3.54">were laid off and they you know I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="255.62" dur="2.94">been talking to them and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="256.97" dur="3.81">saying I&amp;#39;ve been looking everywhere I</text>
  <text start="258.56" dur="4.38">cannot find a job is like nothing out</text>
  <text start="260.78" dur="6.21">there they&amp;#39;re sending resumes around</text>
  <text start="262.94" dur="7.29">there is absolutely nothing yes there</text>
  <text start="266.99" dur="5.34">are lower paying lower paying jobs but</text>
  <text start="270.23" dur="3.49">again how do you support your family</text>
  <text start="272.33" dur="3.46">doing this and</text>
  <text start="273.72" dur="3.27">you know at a certain period of time</text>
  <text start="275.79" dur="3.33">these people don&amp;#39;t have to make a</text>
  <text start="276.99" dur="4.74">decision do we sell our house do we</text>
  <text start="279.12" dur="3.54">start selling things you know what of</text>
  <text start="281.73" dur="3.27">course they have to go into their</text>
  <text start="282.66" dur="4.08">savings if they have any and this is a</text>
  <text start="285" dur="4.02">very big problem all across the country</text>
  <text start="286.74" dur="5.93">right now because the unemployment is a</text>
  <text start="289.02" dur="6.51">lot higher than what they are reporting</text>
  <text start="292.67" dur="4.63">now as we know in Syria they are</text>
  <text start="295.53" dur="4.35">dismantling the chemical weapons and</text>
  <text start="297.3" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re trying to truck and move the</text>
  <text start="299.88" dur="5.4">chemical weapons out of Syria and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.76" dur="7.05">happening right now is that the Syrian</text>
  <text start="305.28" dur="7.35">Army is trying to get the chemical</text>
  <text start="309.81" dur="5.79">weapons out of the country and that they</text>
  <text start="312.63" dur="5.85">have to fight along this one passageway</text>
  <text start="315.6" dur="6.32">this one Road in the country because the</text>
  <text start="318.48" dur="6.45">rebels I guess our butt up against this</text>
  <text start="321.92" dur="4.749">road and it&amp;#39;s making it very difficult</text>
  <text start="324.93" dur="4.44">for them to get these chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="326.669" dur="4.891">out and the Syrian forces went on the</text>
  <text start="329.37" dur="5.04">offensive on Saturday against rebels</text>
  <text start="331.56" dur="5.7">position along a major highway linking</text>
  <text start="334.41" dur="4.92">the capital with the coast rebel said a</text>
  <text start="337.26" dur="4.17">strategic road that is likely to be used</text>
  <text start="339.33" dur="3.96">to extract chemical weapons from the</text>
  <text start="341.43" dur="3.78">country and they are afraid that these</text>
  <text start="343.29" dur="5.01">rebels are going to try to get their</text>
  <text start="345.21" dur="8.07">hands on these chemical weapons and this</text>
  <text start="348.3" dur="6.929">is a very big problem now a couple weeks</text>
  <text start="353.28" dur="5.22">ago and I believe this was the end of</text>
  <text start="355.229" dur="8.491">October near Halloween Israel flew in</text>
  <text start="358.5" dur="8.46">and destroyed some missile depots that</text>
  <text start="363.72" dur="6">were on military bases and they I think</text>
  <text start="366.96" dur="8.04">they did this four times as of right now</text>
  <text start="369.72" dur="9.84">and what came out is that before they</text>
  <text start="375" dur="6.69">actually struck into Syria of course you</text>
  <text start="379.56" dur="4.95">know Syria didn&amp;#39;t strike them they just</text>
  <text start="381.69" dur="4.26">flew in with their jets and bombed Syria</text>
  <text start="384.51" dur="3.45">it&amp;#39;s almost like wherever you whatever</text>
  <text start="385.95" dur="3.87">country you&amp;#39;re in right now it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="387.96" dur="3.66">another nation just flying in and</text>
  <text start="389.82" dur="3.72">bombing and of course what what would</text>
  <text start="391.62" dur="5.64">any other country do that would be an</text>
  <text start="393.54" dur="6.689">act of war well they flew in and they</text>
  <text start="397.26" dur="7.29">bombed the missiles in Syria but what</text>
  <text start="400.229" dur="7.321">has come out is that nine hours before</text>
  <text start="404.55" dur="7.26">this happened the US military</text>
  <text start="407.55" dur="9.24">ordered photographs of the exact same</text>
  <text start="411.81" dur="8.28">location that was bombed by Israel so</text>
  <text start="416.79" dur="7.17">what does that tell you basically what</text>
  <text start="420.09" dur="6.39">happened was at 10am nine hours before</text>
  <text start="423.96" dur="4.62">the strike the United States took</text>
  <text start="426.48" dur="4.44">photographs of the basis that were going</text>
  <text start="428.58" dur="5.31">to get hit and then transfer them over</text>
  <text start="430.92" dur="8.99">to Israel to let them know these are the</text>
  <text start="433.89" dur="9.15">targets so the US was / 0 was provoking</text>
  <text start="439.91" dur="5.62">Syria this is what they were doing</text>
  <text start="443.04" dur="8.61">because I&amp;#39;ve said this in many many</text>
  <text start="445.53" dur="10.26">reports the agenda is still the same the</text>
  <text start="451.65" dur="7.08">goal is still the same to get into Syria</text>
  <text start="455.79" dur="6.39">and Iran this these peace talks this</text>
  <text start="458.73" dur="6.81">chemical weapon dismantling is our</text>
  <text start="462.18" dur="5.58">complete illusion right now this is to</text>
  <text start="465.54" dur="6.54">fool everyone to make everyone think</text>
  <text start="467.76" dur="6.51">that the u.s. is looking for peaceful</text>
  <text start="472.08" dur="5.55">central bankers are looking for peace</text>
  <text start="474.27" dur="5.79">and this is completely not true what</text>
  <text start="477.63" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re going to end up doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="480.06" dur="7.53">going to have something happen here in</text>
  <text start="482.58" dur="8.57">the US to get the war started and we can</text>
  <text start="487.59" dur="7.53">see that there has been a buildup of</text>
  <text start="491.15" dur="6.79">information coming out preparing for</text>
  <text start="495.12" dur="4.65">these false flags now the FBI has come</text>
  <text start="497.94" dur="4.58">out now and it&amp;#39;s warning the US</text>
  <text start="499.77" dur="7.34">government that Anonymous hackers</text>
  <text start="502.52" dur="7.54">breached a lot of governmental offices</text>
  <text start="507.11" dur="5.89">businesses banks and financial</text>
  <text start="510.06" dur="4.83">institutions and what they said is that</text>
  <text start="513" dur="6.59">they have stolen sensitive information</text>
  <text start="514.89" dur="8.43">and they have left the back door open</text>
  <text start="519.59" dur="6.4">for anybody else and they&amp;#39;ve left the</text>
  <text start="523.32" dur="6.29">back door open in the department of</text>
  <text start="525.99" dur="7.71">energy in their systems in the financial</text>
  <text start="529.61" dur="7.21">institutions and in businesses and right</text>
  <text start="533.7" dur="5.19">now the FBI is reporting and this is an</text>
  <text start="536.82" dur="4.11">internal email from energy secretary</text>
  <text start="538.89" dur="3.93">Ernest Moniz</text>
  <text start="540.93" dur="3.81">the stolen data included personal</text>
  <text start="542.82" dur="4.2">information on at least one hundred and</text>
  <text start="544.74" dur="5.58">four thousand employees and contractors</text>
  <text start="547.02" dur="5.55">family members and other associated with</text>
  <text start="550.32" dur="5.459">the Department of Energy along with</text>
  <text start="552.57" dur="7.53">information on almost 2000 bank accounts</text>
  <text start="555.779" dur="6.991">and the FBI is saying right now it is</text>
  <text start="560.1" dur="5.22">unknown exactly how many systems have</text>
  <text start="562.77" dur="6.05">been compromised but it is a widespread</text>
  <text start="565.32" dur="7.65">problem and now they have left a</text>
  <text start="568.82" dur="9.16">passageway for other hackers or cyber</text>
  <text start="572.97" dur="6.69">attackers to come in and pretty much do</text>
  <text start="577.98" dur="3.51">whatever they want to the systems</text>
  <text start="579.66" dur="4.47">because they have no security at this</text>
  <text start="581.49" dur="6.03">time and we can see they are paving the</text>
  <text start="584.13" dur="8.6">way for something to occur some type of</text>
  <text start="587.52" dur="9.6">false flag event to happen now on CNN</text>
  <text start="592.73" dur="7.27">Mike Rogers was out there again and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="597.12" dur="7.61">saying that al Qaeda has reinvented</text>
  <text start="600" dur="7.95">itself and and what he&amp;#39;s saying is that</text>
  <text start="604.73" dur="6.37">they are posing the biggest terror</text>
  <text start="607.95" dur="7.139">threat to the US homeland in more than a</text>
  <text start="611.1" dur="9.359">decade and Mike Rogers went on to say</text>
  <text start="615.089" dur="9.451">that al Qaeda is posing a huge threat</text>
  <text start="620.459" dur="8.701">and it can be bigger and more</text>
  <text start="624.54" dur="8.34">devastating than 911 and he goes on to</text>
  <text start="629.16" dur="7.86">say that now they have a different</text>
  <text start="632.88" dur="6.329">attitude and more affiliates they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="637.02" dur="5.67">trying to commit acts of violence in the</text>
  <text start="639.209" dur="5.731">United States and he said to me this</text>
  <text start="642.69" dur="4.53">makes the threat much worse against</text>
  <text start="644.94" dur="7.019">United States today than it was even</text>
  <text start="647.22" dur="7.76">before 911 and the threat from al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="651.959" dur="5.491">affiliate has grown they set up in</text>
  <text start="654.98" dur="4.72">unstable countries in Africa and the</text>
  <text start="657.45" dur="4.68">Middle East where they get safe haven</text>
  <text start="659.7" dur="5.579">from their leaders in those countries</text>
  <text start="662.13" dur="6.66">and they are encouraging smaller attack</text>
  <text start="665.279" dur="6.481">scale attacks by lone wolves more than</text>
  <text start="668.79" dur="5.94">ever before and what he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="671.76" dur="5.639">the next attack here is going to be by</text>
  <text start="674.73" dur="5.25">al-qaeda and these lone wolves and what</text>
  <text start="677.399" dur="4.38">he is saying is that and I have a video</text>

  <text start="695.07" dur="4.73">attacks are going to be much worse than</text>
  <text start="697.68" dur="6.33">911 because they are going to happen in</text>
  <text start="699.8" dur="7.479">different areas in many different areas</text>
  <text start="704.01" dur="5.16">in a much smaller scale in the area and</text>
  <text start="707.279" dur="4.201">this is what I&amp;#39;ve been talking about is</text>
  <text start="709.17" dur="5.01">that these attacks that are going to</text>
  <text start="711.48" dur="5.78">eventually come from Iran ants and Syria</text>
  <text start="714.18" dur="6.81">they are going to be a mixture of</text>
  <text start="717.26" dur="5.379">chemical nuclear and you can see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="720.99" dur="5.25">happening with the cyber attacks and the</text>
  <text start="722.639" dur="5.731">grid x2 drill they are paving the way</text>
  <text start="726.24" dur="4.83">they are getting prepared they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="728.37" dur="5.31">learning how they can completely bring</text>
  <text start="731.07" dur="6.6">down the system and they are going to</text>
  <text start="733.68" dur="6.12">use this as a look anonymous left back</text>
  <text start="737.67" dur="6.02">doors and this is how the Syrian</text>

  <text start="905.73" dur="4.919">they had to figure out a way to get out</text>
