  <text start="118.06" dur="4.71">be roadblocks yes the deep State is</text>
  <text start="120.16" dur="6.239">going to try to do many other things but</text>

  <text start="126.399" dur="4.2">gone</text>
  <text start="127.36" dur="7.04">and we can see that Trump is now moving</text>
  <text start="130.599" dur="7.021">forward with helping to rebuild America</text>
  <text start="134.4" dur="5.08">bringing jobs back changing regulations</text>
  <text start="137.62" dur="5.43">changing the laws bringing manufacturing</text>

  <text start="143.05" dur="7.53">entire system buckles under its own</text>
  <text start="146.53" dur="6.15">weight of debt and we can see that he is</text>
  <text start="150.58" dur="3.659">pushing this to the extreme I mean look</text>
  <text start="152.68" dur="5.52">at the initial jobless claims right now</text>
  <text start="154.239" dur="7.401">they are grinding lower and lower that</text>
  <text start="158.2" dur="5.79">means many people are not applying for</text>
  <text start="161.64" dur="4.15">jobless claims</text>
  <text start="163.99" dur="3.93">the last time this few Americans sought</text>
  <text start="165.79" dur="7.47">the help of the government after losing</text>
  <text start="167.92" dur="6.81">a job was in November 1969 initial</text>
  <text start="173.26" dur="4.32">jobless Kings while that tumbled another</text>
  <text start="174.73" dur="7.35">5,000 from the prior week where it was</text>
  <text start="177.58" dur="7.41">at 197 and now it&amp;#39;s 192 and it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="182.08" dur="6.66">second consecutive sub 200,000 print in</text>
  <text start="184.99" dur="7.14">50 years the lowest print since 1969 I</text>
  <text start="188.74" dur="5.13">mean this is just unbelievable and you</text>
  <text start="192.13" dur="4.56">can see what Trump is trying to do here</text>
  <text start="193.87" dur="4.86">he&amp;#39;s trying to get everyone off of the</text>
  <text start="196.69" dur="3.93">dependency of the government he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="198.73" dur="3.87">want people dependent on the government</text>
  <text start="200.62" dur="4.2">because when we make this move this</text>
  <text start="202.6" dur="4.92">transition guess what</text>
  <text start="204.82" dur="4.77">the government they&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="207.52" dur="4.68">able to help many people now think about</text>
  <text start="209.59" dur="3.63">if many people were still dependent on</text>
  <text start="212.2" dur="2.64">the government I know there&amp;#39;s many</text>
  <text start="213.22" dur="5.1">people that are still on food stamps and</text>
  <text start="214.84" dur="6.09">entitlement programs but what Trump is</text>
  <text start="218.32" dur="6.12">trying to do is get many off as possible</text>
  <text start="220.93" dur="4.92">so there are many that are not dependent</text>
  <text start="224.44" dur="4.68">on the government because the government</text>
  <text start="225.85" dur="6">will not be able to help during this</text>
  <text start="229.12" dur="5.22">major major crisis people are gonna have</text>
  <text start="231.85" dur="3.9">to fend for themselves and the other</text>
  <text start="234.34" dur="5.88">thing that Trump is doing right now</text>
  <text start="235.75" dur="6.9">he is really boxing in the Fed because</text>
  <text start="240.22" dur="4.5">the Fed is going to have a very</text>
  <text start="242.65" dur="4.44">difficult time to explain why it is</text>
  <text start="244.72" dur="4.35">pausing its rate hikes at a time when</text>
  <text start="247.09" dur="4.47">the fewest number of Americans are</text>
  <text start="249.07" dur="4.23">filing for jobless benefits in a half</text>
  <text start="251.56" dur="4.71">century I mean what the Fed is doing</text>
  <text start="253.3" dur="6.439">right now makes no sense when you look</text>
  <text start="256.27" dur="5.96">at the statistical numbers and the Fed</text>
  <text start="259.739" dur="6.161">well they&amp;#39;re boxed in</text>
  <text start="262.23" dur="4.45">Trump has trapped them and this was on</text>
  <text start="265.9" dur="3.39">purpose</text>
  <text start="266.68" dur="5.67">now we can see that retail sales they</text>
  <text start="269.29" dur="4.83">have surged and it looks like a lot of</text>
  <text start="272.35" dur="2.94">people are getting tax refunds even</text>
  <text start="274.12" dur="3.66">though the mainstream media is out there</text>
  <text start="275.29" dur="4.44">saying oh the tax refunds are much lower</text>
  <text start="277.78" dur="6.09">no one&amp;#39;s in this but remember a lot of</text>
  <text start="279.73" dur="6.33">people received their tax cuts in their</text>
  <text start="283.87" dur="5.85">check every month a lot of people who</text>
  <text start="286.06" dur="6.06">applied for their taxes received a tax</text>
  <text start="289.72" dur="4.62">cut and you can see that many people are</text>
  <text start="292.12" dur="4.5">receiving this money and they went out</text>
  <text start="294.34" dur="2.73">and they finally purchased some items</text>
  <text start="296.62" dur="2.67">this mean</text>
  <text start="297.07" dur="4.62">retells bouncing back no it just means</text>
  <text start="299.29" dur="3.93">we have a blip right now showing that</text>
  <text start="301.69" dur="3.03">people went out and they purchased</text>
  <text start="303.22" dur="6.06">because the month prior it was</text>
  <text start="304.72" dur="7.98">absolutely awful at the same time we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="309.28" dur="5.22">seeing that the retail sector the</text>
  <text start="312.7" dur="6.21">brick-and-mortar stores they are taking</text>
  <text start="314.5" dur="6.99">a major major hit right now 5995 stores</text>
  <text start="318.91" dur="4.41">they have closed in the u.s. so far this</text>
  <text start="321.49" dur="4.98">year which is already more than last</text>
  <text start="323.32" dur="6.18">year&amp;#39;s total of 5964 and this is coming</text>
  <text start="326.47" dur="5.79">from the real deal so if we take a look</text>
  <text start="329.5" dur="5.01">at mall vacancy rates they ticked up in</text>
  <text start="332.26" dur="4.47">the first quarter to nine point three</text>
  <text start="334.51" dur="5.13">percent from nine percent in the fourth</text>
  <text start="336.73" dur="5.01">quarter of 2018 and finally one of the</text>
  <text start="339.64" dur="4.59">country&amp;#39;s largest malls destiny USA in</text>
  <text start="341.74" dur="4.74">Syracuse recently saw its mortgage taken</text>
  <text start="344.23" dur="4.23">over by special servicer and even though</text>
  <text start="346.48" dur="3.87">the mall owner pyramid Management Group</text>
  <text start="348.46" dur="4.44">says that it&amp;#39;s trying to discuss an</text>
  <text start="350.35" dur="6.42">extension the servicer is expecting a</text>
  <text start="352.9" dur="6.39">default from the owner in June UBS has</text>

  <text start="359.29" dur="5.79">will have to close by 2026 and we know</text>
  <text start="363.19" dur="4.95">that all of this is not moving to online</text>
  <text start="365.08" dur="4.41">yes online more and more people are</text>
  <text start="368.14" dur="5.01">going to online but it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="369.49" dur="7.02">one-to-one ratio and as a retail as a</text>
  <text start="373.15" dur="5.16">whole we can see retail is not doing</text>
  <text start="376.51" dur="4.89">well and we need to remember something</text>
  <text start="378.31" dur="4.59">very important when we talk about retail</text>

  <text start="527.69" dur="5.55">the people there as long as it is a</text>
  <text start="530.39" dur="5.88">benefit to us and when more and more</text>
  <text start="533.24" dur="6.09">people go to work and the company is</text>
  <text start="536.27" dur="5.52">there guess what people have money other</text>
  <text start="539.33" dur="4.26">businesses pop up in that area and then</text>
  <text start="541.79" dur="3.75">you get the small mom-and-pop storage</text>
  <text start="543.59" dur="4.17">popping up or maybe even chain stores</text>
  <text start="545.54" dur="4.71">because now people have money to spend</text>
  <text start="547.76" dur="5.9">in this area a lot more than they had</text>
  <text start="550.25" dur="6.65">before and this is how you build</text>
  <text start="553.66" dur="6.91">different areas within the United States</text>
  <text start="556.9" dur="5.35">the deep state the central bankers they</text>

  <text start="562.25" dur="5.04">they never did this they were they had a</text>
  <text start="564.26" dur="6.18">completely different plan and Trump</text>
  <text start="567.29" dur="8.79">right now is pushing back and going full</text>
  <text start="570.44" dur="9.18">steam ahead and the Fed well they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="576.08" dur="6.21">trouble and Trump is boxing them and</text>
  <text start="579.62" dur="4.08">putting them in a corner on purpose</text>
  <text start="582.29" dur="3.21">think about why do you think Trump is</text>
  <text start="583.7" dur="3.72">contradicting the Fed all the time well</text>
  <text start="585.5" dur="4.11">he&amp;#39;s doing it so the American people</text>
  <text start="587.42" dur="5.49">know that the Fed is responsible for</text>
  <text start="589.61" dur="4.43">when this economic system implodes on</text>
  <text start="592.91" dur="3.93">itself</text>
  <text start="594.04" dur="5.65">Trump is also contradicting the Fed to</text>
  <text start="596.84" dur="6.54">make sure they stick by their mandate</text>
  <text start="599.69" dur="8.04">what is their mandate well they have</text>
  <text start="603.38" dur="8.16">dual mandates to promote price stability</text>

  <text start="620.99" dur="6.65">it&amp;#39;s not 1% it&amp;#39;s not 2% it&amp;#39;s not 5% and</text>
  <text start="624.61" dur="5.74">Trump is doing this on purpose</text>
  <text start="627.64" dur="5.26">continually keeping the spotlight on the</text>
  <text start="630.35" dur="4.83">Fed and he&amp;#39;s continually contradicting</text>
  <text start="632.9" dur="4.53">them over and over and over to make sure</text>
  <text start="635.18" dur="4.8">that the people understand who is</text>
  <text start="637.43" dur="5.04">responsible for this economy because he</text>
  <text start="639.98" dur="4.41">knows the Patriots know that once they</text>

  <text start="655.13" dur="5.7">blame them for it and then look into</text>
  <text start="657.77" dur="6.6">their books with an audit now we know</text>
  <text start="660.83" dur="6.66">that Trump is trying to get people into</text>
  <text start="664.37" dur="6.3">the Fed and these are outsiders these</text>
