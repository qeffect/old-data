  <text start="124.409" dur="6.931">ticking time bomb now is this to blame I</text>
  <text start="128.39" dur="6">mean are we to blame Canada for all of</text>
  <text start="131.34" dur="6.6">us know this is a symptom of a bigger</text>
  <text start="134.39" dur="7.21">problem and the the main problem is the</text>
  <text start="137.94" dur="6.18">central bank the main problem is the</text>
  <text start="141.6" dur="6.3">issuance of all this debt around the</text>
  <text start="144.12" dur="6.03">world the main problem is a central bank</text>
  <text start="147.9" dur="5.24">where they&amp;#39;re trying to reap all the</text>
  <text start="150.15" dur="7.82">profits and give nothing to the people</text>
  <text start="153.14" dur="7.33">this system can&amp;#39;t work this way and</text>
  <text start="157.97" dur="4.87">they&amp;#39;re just sucking up all the wealth</text>
  <text start="160.47" dur="3.12">at this point because they know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="162.84" dur="3.899">coming</text>
  <text start="163.59" dur="6.03">I mean the Fed chickened out today and</text>
  <text start="166.739" dur="5.551">said you know something we&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="169.62" dur="5.6">to raise interest rates they have failed</text>
  <text start="172.29" dur="5.1">to raise the interest rates for the 55th</text>
  <text start="175.22" dur="5.099">consecutive time what does that tell you</text>
  <text start="177.39" dur="6.09">and they keep making the same excuses oh</text>
  <text start="180.319" dur="6.071">we don&amp;#39;t see the enough inflation right</text>
  <text start="183.48" dur="5.339">now but unemployment looks strong it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="186.39" dur="6.239">getting stronger it&amp;#39;s very low right now</text>
  <text start="188.819" dur="8.221">the economies will expand at a moderate</text>
  <text start="192.629" dur="8.131">pace but we&amp;#39;re just not ready maybe in</text>
  <text start="197.04" dur="7.41">October well we understand right now</text>
  <text start="200.76" dur="5.819">that they cannot cannot raise the</text>
  <text start="204.45" dur="4.349">interest rates and if we get the signal</text>
  <text start="206.579" dur="6.261">that they&amp;#39;re going to do it that is the</text>
  <text start="208.799" dur="6.361">signal that this whole entire economy is</text>
  <text start="212.84" dur="6.94">ready to fall apart and they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="215.16" dur="7.74">ready to have that big event that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="219.78" dur="5.64">signal now will it happen in any other</text>
  <text start="222.9" dur="4.739">way of course it might there&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="225.42" dur="4.62">black swans there&amp;#39;s always things that</text>
  <text start="227.639" dur="4.38">they can&amp;#39;t control but their biggest</text>
  <text start="230.04" dur="3.27">thing is they want to control this</text>
  <text start="232.019" dur="4.741">they&amp;#39;re trying to kick the can down the</text>
  <text start="233.31" dur="5.009">street a little bit longer because they</text>
  <text start="236.76" dur="4.02">don&amp;#39;t want to give up the power they</text>
  <text start="238.319" dur="5.67">love being the reserve currency they</text>
  <text start="240.78" dur="4.65">love being in control they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="243.989" dur="4.58">hand this control over to anyone else</text>
  <text start="245.43" dur="6.08">and guess what if the system dies</text>
  <text start="248.569" dur="6.82">everything dies with it we go to war</text>
  <text start="251.51" dur="5.56">that&amp;#39;s the answer but one of the biggest</text>
  <text start="255.389" dur="7.431">stunners coming out of this meeting is</text>
  <text start="257.07" dur="11.13">that the fed announced that it might go</text>
  <text start="262.82" dur="10">negative in rates maybe by the end of</text>
  <text start="268.2" dur="7.92">2015 going into 2016 so they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="272.82" dur="6.96">go negative interest rates I mean look</text>
  <text start="276.12" dur="5.93">what they need to do to keep this system</text>
  <text start="279.78" dur="4.68">alive because the debt right now is</text>
  <text start="282.05" dur="5.35">unsustainable it just cannot be</text>
  <text start="284.46" dur="4.59">sustained if they raise any any interest</text>
  <text start="287.4" dur="5.88">if there&amp;#39;s any interest rate hike it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="289.05" dur="6.72">impossible they cannot happen the</text>
  <text start="293.28" dur="4.21">housing market would completely fall</text>
  <text start="295.77" dur="4.269">apart</text>
  <text start="297.49" dur="6.17">emerging markets all the emerging</text>
  <text start="300.039" dur="6.301">economies would be a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="303.66" dur="4.72">remember China is a manufacturing</text>
  <text start="306.34" dur="7.139">powerhouse and they&amp;#39;ve been hoarding</text>
  <text start="308.38" dur="7.259">gold the US has no gold actually JP</text>
  <text start="313.479" dur="7.47">Morgan is one delivery away from having</text>
  <text start="315.639" dur="9.541">their entire gold reserves emptied so we</text>
  <text start="320.949" dur="7.201">see right now that this economy is not</text>
  <text start="325.18" dur="6.209">in a recovery it&amp;#39;s in a collapse the Fed</text>
  <text start="328.15" dur="6.87">just proved it the feds showed us that</text>
  <text start="331.389" dur="6.21">yeah even with unemployment down a 5.1</text>
  <text start="335.02" dur="4.23">percent with all these great GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="337.599" dur="3.961">that are completely manipulated and</text>
  <text start="339.25" dur="5.55">revised and manipulate it again and</text>
  <text start="341.56" dur="5.579">massaged we&amp;#39;re still not there so in the</text>
  <text start="344.8" dur="5.22">end when unemployment goes down to four</text>
  <text start="347.139" dur="5.821">point nine percent what in the world are</text>
  <text start="350.02" dur="5.97">they going to use as an excuse think</text>
  <text start="352.96" dur="6.29">about it I mean we&amp;#39;re hearing all these</text>
  <text start="355.99" dur="7.88">layoffs from all these companies</text>
  <text start="359.25" dur="10.24">unicredit Deutsche jpmorgan chase bank</text>
  <text start="363.87" dur="9.16">of america Dell sony and many others</text>
  <text start="369.49" dur="6.56">tens of thousands of jobs but the</text>
  <text start="373.03" dur="5.58">initial jobless claims fell 11,000 to</text>
  <text start="376.05" dur="7.63">264,000 last week hovering near its</text>
  <text start="378.61" dur="7.89">lowest level since 1973 I mean does this</text>
  <text start="383.68" dur="6">even make sense to anybody of course it</text>
  <text start="386.5" dur="7.11">doesn&amp;#39;t but what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="389.68" dur="6.62">the BLS had to admit that at least two</text>
  <text start="393.61" dur="6.359">hundred and eight thousand total jobs</text>
  <text start="396.3" dur="7.66">we&amp;#39;re over estimated in the year ending</text>
  <text start="399.969" dur="6.391">march 2015 this is equivalent to</text>
  <text start="403.96" dur="4.829">eliminating nearly one month of job</text>
  <text start="406.36" dur="5.69">gains in the specified 12-month period</text>
  <text start="408.789" dur="6.271">and spread across the various months so</text>
  <text start="412.05" dur="4.929">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re admitting to and we</text>
  <text start="415.06" dur="5.27">know they completely manipulate all the</text>
  <text start="416.979" dur="8.97">other numbers so they overestimated</text>
  <text start="420.33" dur="10.5">208,000 jobs this whole unemployment</text>
  <text start="425.949" dur="10.181">number you can&amp;#39;t even believe it anymore</text>
  <text start="430.83" dur="7.86">it&amp;#39;s so full of holes it&amp;#39;s so fake I</text>
  <text start="436.13" dur="3.79">mean everything around us all the</text>
  <text start="438.69" dur="4.71">indicators that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="439.92" dur="7.5">manufacturing business inventories</text>
  <text start="443.4" dur="5.55">industrial production all the things</text>
  <text start="447.42" dur="4.65">that we talked about yesterday going</text>
  <text start="448.95" dur="7.83">back to 2008 to the present about</text>
  <text start="452.07" dur="5.97">student loans about money printing about</text>
  <text start="456.78" dur="3.87">how many people are out of the workforce</text>
  <text start="458.04" dur="5.67">I mean all of that is pointing to one</text>
  <text start="460.65" dur="7.05">thing and one thing only a huge gigantic</text>
  <text start="463.71" dur="6.12">bubble that will burst and it will</text>
  <text start="467.7" dur="4.83">collapse the entire system because</text>
  <text start="469.83" dur="7.02">that&amp;#39;s what it is I mean the philly fed</text>
  <text start="472.53" dur="9.62">right now crashes to 31-month lows the</text>
  <text start="476.85" dur="8.97">philly fed went from 8.3 to negative six</text>
  <text start="482.15" dur="8.29">missing expectations by the most in four</text>
  <text start="485.82" dur="8.28">years sounds like a recovery to me</text>
  <text start="490.44" dur="7.28">doesn&amp;#39;t it I saw in the corporate media</text>
  <text start="494.1" dur="7.98">where they&amp;#39;re saying that housing prices</text>
  <text start="497.72" dur="6.16">are starting to cool off in august well</text>
  <text start="502.08" dur="3.75">remember the corporate media&amp;#39;s telling</text>
  <text start="503.88" dur="6.81">you things that have happened in the</text>
  <text start="505.83" dur="9.98">past housing prices started to cool back</text>
  <text start="510.69" dur="8.7">in April May we&amp;#39;re in September now</text>
  <text start="515.81" dur="6.91">there is no cooling the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="519.39" dur="5.04">collapsing and we see mortgage</text>
  <text start="522.72" dur="4.5">applications down by seventeen percent</text>
  <text start="524.43" dur="7.38">and housing starts declined to a</text>
  <text start="527.22" dur="7.37">three-month low so what are we seeing</text>
  <text start="531.81" dur="6.09">here we&amp;#39;re seeing the housing market</text>
  <text start="534.59" dur="6.49">starting to fall apart remember they</text>
  <text start="537.9" dur="5.24">good season for housing is over we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="541.08" dur="6.15">moving into the fall and winter and</text>
  <text start="543.14" dur="6.01">during this whole summer period housing</text>
  <text start="547.23" dur="4.38">never took off actually prices have</text>
  <text start="549.15" dur="6.21">continually come down houses have been</text>
  <text start="551.61" dur="7.8">on the market longer and longer it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="555.36" dur="9.09">working the bubble is at its maximum</text>
  <text start="559.41" dur="11.22">it&amp;#39;s ready to burst the northeast tom</text>
  <text start="564.45" dur="8.19">by thirty four percent I mean this is</text>
  <text start="570.63" dur="4.26">just unbelievable what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="572.64" dur="5.28">right now but they&amp;#39;re still saying the</text>
  <text start="574.89" dur="5.34">housing market is strong this is what a</text>
  <text start="577.92" dur="4.88">recovery looks like when things fall</text>
  <text start="580.23" dur="4.65">apart it means everything is fine now</text>
  <text start="582.8" dur="3.55">when things start to fall apart that</text>
  <text start="584.88" dur="3.99">means things are going downhill very</text>
  <text start="586.35" dur="4.47">quickly but they&amp;#39;re not going to tell</text>
  <text start="588.87" dur="5.49">you this because they want you to</text>
  <text start="590.82" dur="9.12">believe in the recovery they want you to</text>
  <text start="594.36" dur="8.31">believe that everything is fine I mean</text>
  <text start="599.94" dur="4.83">we see that the US Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="602.67" dur="4.89">is never going after the big banks</text>
  <text start="604.77" dur="4.62">actually they just giving them a license</text>
  <text start="607.56" dur="3.09">to steal they&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="609.39" dur="3">going to go after any banks whatsoever</text>
  <text start="610.65" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re going to go after those people</text>
  <text start="612.39" dur="5.46">who took orders from the top and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="615.93" dur="4.2">going to go after those lackeys who</text>
  <text start="617.85" dur="5.28">follow the orders those are the people</text>
  <text start="620.13" dur="5.67">we need to go after not the CEOs not the</text>
  <text start="623.13" dur="5.19">elite of the banks it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="625.8" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;s like in the Armed Forces let&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="628.32" dur="2.76">get let&amp;#39;s not go after the person that</text>
  <text start="629.61" dur="4.26">gave the orders let&amp;#39;s go after the</text>
  <text start="631.08" dur="5.45">person that followed the orders that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="633.87" dur="7.56">not going to the heart of the problem</text>
  <text start="636.53" dur="9.64">well this is what you see in a fascist</text>
  <text start="641.43" dur="7.17">country the head of corporations get a</text>
  <text start="646.17" dur="5.31">free pass all the low-level people</text>
  <text start="648.6" dur="5.48">they&amp;#39;re the ones who get caught up in it</text>
  <text start="651.48" dur="7.55">they&amp;#39;re the ones that are expendable</text>
  <text start="654.08" dur="4.95">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and</text>
  <text start="659.21" dur="4.09">this is going to continue because we see</text>
  <text start="662.04" dur="5.7">with all the laws and everything they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="663.3" dur="8.46">passing more and more companies the</text>
  <text start="667.74" dur="8.34">central banks are controlling what is</text>
  <text start="671.76" dur="8.25">going on in this country and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="676.08" dur="6.12">continually getting larger their</text>
  <text start="680.01" dur="5.94">presence is getting bigger in government</text>
  <text start="682.2" dur="10.05">and their two are intertwined right now</text>
  <text start="685.95" dur="9.06">and this spells a complete disaster now</text>
  <text start="692.25" dur="5.58">we see gold is continually suppressed I</text>
  <text start="695.01" dur="5.79">mean it pops up 10 12 you</text>
  <text start="697.83" dur="5.13">dollars its then pushed down another ten</text>
  <text start="700.8" dur="4.26">twelve dollars so it&amp;#39;s really flat lined</text>
  <text start="702.96" dur="5.58">at this point but when we look around</text>
  <text start="705.06" dur="4.92">the world we see other countries where</text>
  <text start="708.54" dur="5.73">their currencies have been devalued and</text>
  <text start="709.98" dur="6.66">we see in those countries gold has risen</text>
  <text start="714.27" dur="4.95">to near record highs in many of these</text>
  <text start="716.64" dur="3.69">countries and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a lot</text>
  <text start="719.22" dur="5.34">of people in the Middle East South</text>
  <text start="720.33" dur="6.06">Africa Brazil Argentina they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="724.56" dur="4.35">protecting themselves and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="726.39" dur="5.7">continually purchasing precious metals</text>
  <text start="728.91" dur="5.49">because as your currencies devalue your</text>
  <text start="732.09" dur="4.65">currency becomes worthless they realize</text>
  <text start="734.4" dur="6.06">they&amp;#39;d rather have the precious metals</text>
  <text start="736.74" dur="4.71">than have the paper and ink now here in</text>
  <text start="740.46" dur="3.48">the United States we have not</text>
  <text start="741.45" dur="4.02">experienced this yet we don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="743.94" dur="5.15">most people don&amp;#39;t understand this yet</text>
  <text start="745.47" dur="5.37">but when the currency loses its value</text>
