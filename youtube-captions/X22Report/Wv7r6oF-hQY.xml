  <text start="42" dur="5.94">is global corporate defaults on pace to</text>
  <text start="44.85" dur="6.959">pass 2009 record we are seeing an</text>
  <text start="47.94" dur="7.26">economic implosion let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="51.809" dur="6.75">economic collapse financial news now as</text>
  <text start="55.2" dur="5.73">we move into the summer here into the</text>
  <text start="58.559" dur="5.401">middle of the summer we&amp;#39;re realizing</text>
  <text start="60.93" dur="4.62">that the economy is accelerating to the</text>
  <text start="63.96" dur="3.54">downside down the corporate media the US</text>
  <text start="65.55" dur="5.22">government the Fed they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="67.5" dur="5.43">pushing the idea that everything looks</text>
  <text start="70.77" dur="5.37">good i mean the corporate media today</text>
  <text start="72.93" dur="7.68">saying retail sales are up they tell us</text>
  <text start="76.14" dur="7.2">housing is up everything looks good but</text>
  <text start="80.61" dur="4.68">you have to remember when the corporate</text>
  <text start="83.34" dur="5.19">media comes out and says retail is</text>
  <text start="85.29" dur="6.719">surging once again well if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="88.53" dur="7.11">surging from a period of where sales</text>
  <text start="92.009" dur="9.241">have been down maybe in the negative</text>
  <text start="95.64" dur="8.52">range and they surged up to 0 that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="101.25" dur="6.39">a surge when you step back and you look</text>
  <text start="104.16" dur="8.489">at the year-on-year trend of retail</text>
  <text start="107.64" dur="8.069">sales you see the trend is down a little</text>
  <text start="112.649" dur="4.83">bounce gives you absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="115.709" dur="5.39">we&amp;#39;ve seen many different dead cat</text>
  <text start="117.479" dur="7.92">bounces occur but the trend is</text>
  <text start="121.099" dur="7.41">continually declining but they make they</text>
  <text start="125.399" dur="6.661">like to use these small little pops as</text>
  <text start="128.509" dur="4.991">everything is back on track and then of</text>
  <text start="132.06" dur="3.48">course what happens is they revised</text>
  <text start="133.5" dur="3.63">numbers they manipulated the massage it</text>
  <text start="135.54" dur="4.73">and they do whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="137.13" dur="7.14">but when you really look at the numbers</text>
  <text start="140.27" dur="6.07">they&amp;#39;re going nowhere and people are</text>
  <text start="144.27" dur="3.299">starting to realize this because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="146.34" dur="5.16">seeing the you Mitch consumer</text>
  <text start="147.569" dur="8.161">expectations it tumbled to its lowest</text>
  <text start="151.5" dur="7.59">since September of 2014 so we have the</text>
  <text start="155.73" dur="7.2">hope of the people and that hope is</text>
  <text start="159.09" dur="6.14">dying and then we have stocks which is</text>
  <text start="162.93" dur="6.2">continually rising</text>
  <text start="165.23" dur="7.5">we have a problem here it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="169.13" dur="7.93">now I just mentioned retail sales and</text>
  <text start="172.73" dur="7.84">the corporate media is making a huge big</text>
  <text start="177.06" dur="7.05">deal about us retail sales they just</text>
  <text start="180.57" dur="7.08">surged it&amp;#39;s incredible it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s back on</text>
  <text start="184.11" dur="10.26">track they&amp;#39;re up by point six percent</text>
  <text start="187.65" dur="10.11">after the slowdown in May but when we</text>
  <text start="194.37" dur="5.28">look at this what do we say well their</text>
  <text start="197.76" dur="6.35">expectations were a point one percent</text>
  <text start="199.65" dur="8.94">rise it went up by 0.6% but this was due</text>
  <text start="204.11" dur="7.54">to downward revisions from point five</text>
  <text start="208.59" dur="5.28">percent to just point two percent</text>
  <text start="211.65" dur="7.43">year-over-year headline retail sales</text>
  <text start="213.87" dur="11.46">rose 2.7% but continues to hover around</text>
  <text start="219.08" dur="11.56">recessionary area so we step back we</text>
  <text start="225.33" dur="8.66">take a look at where we are I&amp;#39;ll give</text>
  <text start="230.64" dur="8.4">you an example back in two thousand four</text>
  <text start="233.99" dur="6.55">retail sales were at nine and of course</text>
  <text start="239.04" dur="3.21">everyone&amp;#39;s out there wow look at the</text>
  <text start="240.54" dur="5.52">retail it&amp;#39;s incredible it&amp;#39;s doing well</text>
  <text start="242.25" dur="8.37">and it was at that time it dropped down</text>
  <text start="246.06" dur="8.84">in 2005 going into two thousand six to</text>
  <text start="250.62" dur="11.06">five shot back up to about eight and</text>
  <text start="254.9" dur="16.45">then it continued its downward trend 25</text>
  <text start="261.68" dur="14.11">to 32 2.5 it shot up one more time to</text>
  <text start="271.35" dur="11.24">five and then it crashed in 2007 going</text>
  <text start="275.79" dur="14.27">into 2008 back in 2010 we retail sales</text>
  <text start="282.59" dur="11.43">hit around seven or eight in 2012 it</text>
  <text start="290.06" dur="3.96">came down to five</text>
  <text start="294.12" dur="14.46">in 2015 it came down to three it shot</text>
  <text start="301.8" dur="13.64">back up a little bit to about 3.2 and</text>
  <text start="308.58" dur="9.839">then it came down to 2.9 dropped to 2.7</text>
  <text start="315.44" dur="5.83">and when you look at this you see we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="318.419" dur="5.161">in a downward trend actually when you go</text>
  <text start="321.27" dur="4.82">back to two thousand four to two</text>
  <text start="323.58" dur="8.22">thousand eight when you go back to</text>
  <text start="326.09" dur="7.6">nineteen ninety eight to two thousand it</text>
  <text start="331.8" dur="7.399">looks very very similar all on a</text>
  <text start="333.69" dur="10.8">downward trend all heading into a huge</text>
  <text start="339.199" dur="8.861">recession / depression and we know that</text>
  <text start="344.49" dur="8.429">business inventories to sales ratio well</text>
  <text start="348.06" dur="7.26">that is above 1.4 we see us industrial</text>
  <text start="352.919" dur="6.271">production it is decline for the 10th</text>
  <text start="355.32" dur="7.05">straight month now what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="359.19" dur="6.199">right now is that month on month it</text>
  <text start="362.37" dur="7.049">popped up a little bit but year-on-year</text>
  <text start="365.389" dur="9.491">it remains at negative point seven</text>
  <text start="369.419" dur="7.43">percent and again when we look at the</text>
  <text start="374.88" dur="8.13">year on year and what it&amp;#39;s really doing</text>
  <text start="376.849" dur="8.5">it&amp;#39;s declining it it&amp;#39;s not improving</text>
  <text start="383.01" dur="8.81">whatsoever it&amp;#39;s getting worse and worse</text>
  <text start="385.349" dur="11.731">as time goes on the Empire fed</text>
  <text start="391.82" dur="9.61">manufacturing well it declined five</text>
  <text start="397.08" dur="9.35">points from six 2.55 below the five</text>
  <text start="401.43" dur="9.63">expected print so it looks like it</text>
  <text start="406.43" dur="8.65">printed you know at zero then above zero</text>
  <text start="411.06" dur="6.03">then below zero above zero back to zero</text>
  <text start="415.08" dur="5.49">and this has been happening over this</text>
  <text start="417.09" dur="5.22">past six months and we know the US</text>
  <text start="420.57" dur="3.659">government central bankers they have the</text>
  <text start="422.31" dur="4.32">ability to manipulate and each time they</text>
  <text start="424.229" dur="5.401">try to boost certain</text>
  <text start="426.63" dur="6.3">data points but eventually what happens</text>
  <text start="429.63" dur="6.87">is it continually crashes and the trend</text>
  <text start="432.93" dur="6.54">again is down none of this is improving</text>
  <text start="436.5" dur="5.88">right now now we have this indicator of</text>
  <text start="439.47" dur="6.96">global corporate defaults and this is</text>
  <text start="442.38" dur="5.94">very interesting as we know the SP is</text>
  <text start="446.43" dur="4.5">rising two all-time new highs we know</text>
  <text start="448.32" dur="4.05">that&amp;#39;s completely manipulated in the US</text>
  <text start="450.93" dur="3.06">government central bankers they want us</text>
  <text start="452.37" dur="3.72">looking at that saying this is the</text>
  <text start="453.99" dur="4.92">indicator that tells you how the economy</text>
  <text start="456.09" dur="5.82">is doing well no that tells you</text>
  <text start="458.91" dur="5.07">absolutely nothing everything that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="461.91" dur="5.04">been looking at tells you what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="463.98" dur="7.26">going on here so what we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="466.95" dur="7.76">here is that the corporate the global</text>
  <text start="471.24" dur="9.69">corporate defaults well they just hit</text>
  <text start="474.71" dur="9.4">100 what does that mean well when did</text>
  <text start="480.93" dur="9.41">this happen once before well this</text>
  <text start="484.11" dur="14.55">happened back in 2009 and right now</text>
  <text start="490.34" dur="13.48">we&amp;#39;re on pace to surpass the corporate</text>
  <text start="498.66" dur="13.37">default in 2009 and we&amp;#39;re only halfway</text>
  <text start="503.82" dur="12.45">through 2016 this right here shows us</text>
  <text start="512.03" dur="6.43">that we are in big trouble now let&amp;#39;s put</text>
  <text start="516.27" dur="6.079">it all together Manufacturing is</text>
  <text start="518.46" dur="10.56">declining retail is a downward trend</text>
  <text start="522.349" dur="13.211">business inventories above the 1.40 GDP</text>
  <text start="529.02" dur="11.37">declining housing is rolling over what</text>
  <text start="535.56" dur="7.98">are we seeing here a complete implosion</text>
  <text start="540.39" dur="7.11">of the economy right now now let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="543.54" dur="6.53">add on one more thing here because the</text>
  <text start="547.5" dur="7.38">National Association of credit managers</text>
  <text start="550.07" dur="8.84">came out Chris Kuehl and he did not have</text>
  <text start="554.88" dur="7.93">good news what he is saying</text>
  <text start="558.91" dur="9.06">is that the credit cycle is back at its</text>
  <text start="562.81" dur="11.1">weakest since 2009 it is crashed to</text>
  <text start="567.97" dur="10.46">seven-year lows so what we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="573.91" dur="8.97">here is every single economic indicator</text>
  <text start="578.43" dur="8.35">continually tells us that the economy is</text>
  <text start="582.88" dur="5.58">in a downward trend not improving like</text>
  <text start="586.78" dur="5.25">the corporate media wants to make us</text>
  <text start="588.46" dur="4.89">believe not like the Fed the US</text>
  <text start="592.03" dur="4.02">government where they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="593.35" dur="6.99">convince us that everything is fine the</text>
  <text start="596.05" dur="8.1">actual data in all these different</text>
  <text start="600.34" dur="6.72">sectors they&amp;#39;re showing us their</text>
  <text start="604.15" dur="5.79">reporting to us that things are actually</text>
  <text start="607.06" dur="7.35">a lot worse than they&amp;#39;re letting us</text>
  <text start="609.94" dur="6.06">believe and we know the US government</text>
  <text start="614.41" dur="4.5">central bankers they lied to us all the</text>
  <text start="616" dur="7.41">time and they&amp;#39;ll lie to us until the</text>
  <text start="618.91" dur="7.26">very end actually obama lied to the</text>
  <text start="623.41" dur="4.88">people in the UK remember when he was</text>
  <text start="626.17" dur="6.75">out there right before the brexit and</text>
  <text start="628.29" dur="7.93">obama said listen if you vote and you</text>
  <text start="632.92" dur="5.61">vote to leave the EU you&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="636.22" dur="7.62">in the back of the queue for any type of</text>
  <text start="638.53" dur="8.64">trade deal with the u.s. so I&amp;#39;m begging</text>
  <text start="643.84" dur="10.17">you stay in the EU that&amp;#39;s really what he</text>
  <text start="647.17" dur="9.6">said well we come to learn that the UK</text>
  <text start="654.01" dur="5.78">is not in the back of the queue actually</text>
  <text start="656.77" dur="5.7">they&amp;#39;re in the front of the queue Obama</text>
  <text start="659.79" dur="5.74">he has begun preliminary discussions</text>
  <text start="662.47" dur="5.07">with senior UK officials about how they</text>
  <text start="665.53" dur="5.34">might pursue a trade agreement between</text>
  <text start="667.54" dur="8.34">the two countries following the exit</text>
  <text start="670.87" dur="10.29">from the EU so is he lying now or do you</text>

  <text start="681.16" dur="3.69">whatever they had he had to say to</text>
  <text start="683.32" dur="5.85">convince the people to stay with the EU</text>
  <text start="684.85" dur="9.07">and then he turns around and says okay</text>
  <text start="689.17" dur="8.3">let&amp;#39;s get this TP TTIP pass</text>
  <text start="693.92" dur="5.98">he doesn&amp;#39;t care about anything he</text>
  <text start="697.47" dur="4.05">doesn&amp;#39;t care about telling the truth the</text>
  <text start="699.9" dur="3.15">Fed doesn&amp;#39;t care about Tom the truth the</text>
  <text start="701.52" dur="3.75">Fed doesn&amp;#39;t care about telling you if</text>
  <text start="703.05" dur="4.17">the economy is good or bad or anything</text>
  <text start="705.27" dur="3.51">like that they care about themselves</text>
  <text start="707.22" dur="3.33">they don&amp;#39;t care about country they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="708.78" dur="5.16">care about people they have no</text>
  <text start="710.55" dur="5.91">allegiance whatsoever and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="713.94" dur="5.97">seeing right now from all this data is</text>
  <text start="716.46" dur="7.41">that this economy it&amp;#39;s crashing there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="719.91" dur="6.72">no way to look at this yes we&amp;#39;re going</text>
