  <text start="120.239" dur="6">news now as we discussed the reset of</text>
  <text start="123.75" dur="5.97">the economy has begun in Trump he is</text>
  <text start="126.239" dur="6.931">resetting the economy by first tackling</text>
  <text start="129.72" dur="6.3">the trade imbalances and what Trump is</text>
  <text start="133.17" dur="5.58">going to do is he&amp;#39;s going to set the</text>
  <text start="136.02" dur="4.89">trade imbalances straight where there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="138.75" dur="4.65">fair trade between all these countries</text>
  <text start="140.91" dur="4.62">and this needs to be done and it has to</text>
  <text start="143.4" dur="4.89">be done because once we remove the</text>
  <text start="145.53" dur="4.459">petrodollar system this is when the</text>
  <text start="148.29" dur="4.89">United States is going to have to be</text>
  <text start="149.989" dur="5.14">independent with all other countries</text>
  <text start="153.18" dur="6.66">where they&amp;#39;re going to have to have</text>
  <text start="155.129" dur="6.81">something to trade with because if we</text>
  <text start="159.84" dur="4.29">think what happened in the past with the</text>
  <text start="161.939" dur="3.991">petrodollar system these countries that</text>
  <text start="164.13" dur="4.53">keep the petrodollar system in reserve</text>
  <text start="165.93" dur="4.95">they use this to buy goods here in the</text>
  <text start="168.66" dur="4.17">United States well they&amp;#39;re no longer</text>
  <text start="170.88" dur="4.91">going to keep the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="172.83" dur="5.73">system of the petrodollar in reserve so</text>
  <text start="175.79" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;re going to have to have something</text>
  <text start="178.56" dur="6.57">that country&amp;#39;s want we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="181.04" dur="7.12">manufacture things that countries want</text>
  <text start="185.13" dur="6.96">and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to go out to other</text>
  <text start="188.16" dur="8.19">countries and buy what they have and the</text>
  <text start="192.09" dur="7.98">trade has to be fair and balanced this</text>
  <text start="196.35" dur="4.38">is why Trump went after the trade deals</text>
  <text start="200.07" dur="3.81">first</text>
  <text start="200.73" dur="7.53">he knew and he understands that this</text>
  <text start="203.88" dur="8.82">part of it has to be the foundation of</text>
  <text start="208.26" dur="7.92">the reset now moving forward he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="212.7" dur="7.68">to tackle the currency he&amp;#39;s gonna tackle</text>
  <text start="216.18" dur="7.14">the central bank system itself and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="220.38" dur="5.73">said this before the central bank system</text>
  <text start="223.32" dur="5.12">is going to be quite tough to tackle the</text>
  <text start="226.11" dur="5.67">central bankers going back in history</text>
  <text start="228.44" dur="4.54">they don&amp;#39;t give an inch and even if it</text>
  <text start="231.78" dur="4.32">seems like they&amp;#39;re giving an inch</text>
  <text start="232.98" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re really not and Trump knows that</text>
  <text start="236.1" dur="3.54">this is going to be very difficult and</text>
  <text start="237.42" dur="3.87">the central bankers they&amp;#39;re not just</text>
  <text start="239.64" dur="4.38">gonna sit back and just say you know</text>
  <text start="241.29" dur="4.04">what you&amp;#39;re right we should get rid of</text>
  <text start="244.02" dur="3.9">the central bank</text>
  <text start="245.33" dur="4.06">we&amp;#39;re ok with it they&amp;#39;re not going to do</text>
  <text start="247.92" dur="3.93">that they&amp;#39;re never going to give just</text>
  <text start="249.39" dur="3.84">like the deep state operatives do you</text>
  <text start="251.85" dur="2.79">think they&amp;#39;re ever going to admit that</text>
  <text start="253.23" dur="2.76">they were wrong do you ever think</text>
  <text start="254.64" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re going to give an inch do you</text>
  <text start="255.99" dur="6.21">ever think they&amp;#39;re gonna even say that</text>
  <text start="258.69" dur="5.22">yeah we were committing crimes we were</text>
  <text start="262.2" dur="3.93">committing treason they&amp;#39;re never going</text>
  <text start="263.91" dur="5.78">to do this what they&amp;#39;re really good at</text>
  <text start="266.13" dur="7.17">is continuing with the propaganda</text>

  <text start="476.449" dur="3.871">the reset is a little different than</text>
  <text start="478.82" dur="3.84">what we were talking about years ago</text>
  <text start="480.32" dur="5.129">when Obama was president if Clinton was</text>

  <text start="501.62" dur="5.519">bank&amp;#39;s have done over the many many</text>
  <text start="503.27" dur="8.22">years they realized that this point in</text>
  <text start="507.139" dur="7.89">time is the perfect point in time to</text>
  <text start="511.49" dur="6.59">undo everything why because the central</text>
  <text start="515.029" dur="6.151">bank&amp;#39;s system is imploding on itself</text>
  <text start="518.08" dur="7.06">their credibility right now is being</text>
  <text start="521.18" dur="8.12">questioned every single day people are</text>
  <text start="525.14" dur="6.54">being educated on the central bank</text>
  <text start="529.3" dur="4.18">before many people didn&amp;#39;t even know</text>
  <text start="531.68" dur="3.87">about the central bank people didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="533.48" dur="3.359">even know what it was they had no clue</text>
  <text start="535.55" dur="3.87">what the Federal Reserve was they always</text>
  <text start="536.839" dur="5.761">thought hey it&amp;#39;s part of the government</text>
  <text start="539.42" dur="7.13">and they create and they handle the</text>
  <text start="542.6" dur="6.78">economy now people over many many years</text>
  <text start="546.55" dur="4.42">they are waking up to the fact that the</text>
  <text start="549.38" dur="6.18">Federal Reserve is a private corporation</text>
  <text start="550.97" dur="7.23">and they&amp;#39;re realizing that the central</text>
  <text start="555.56" dur="4.62">banks they don&amp;#39;t do things in the best</text>
  <text start="558.2" dur="5.129">interest of the people not just here in</text>
  <text start="560.18" dur="4.829">the United States but around the world</text>
  <text start="563.329" dur="4.32">and Trump with him continually</text>
  <text start="565.009" dur="6.81">contradicting the Fed and pointing to</text>
  <text start="567.649" dur="6.451">the Fed people are now starting to learn</text>
  <text start="571.819" dur="5.43">what the Federal Reserve is all about</text>
  <text start="574.1" dur="5.519">and this is going to continue the the</text>
  <text start="577.249" dur="6.06">central bank they&amp;#39;re very worried about</text>
  <text start="579.619" dur="6.09">being exposed about pushing them from</text>
  <text start="583.309" dur="4.56">behind the curtain to the out in front</text>
  <text start="585.709" dur="2.67">of the curtain they never wanted this to</text>
  <text start="587.869" dur="3.301">happen</text>
  <text start="588.379" dur="4.89">Trump by continually contradicting by</text>
  <text start="591.17" dur="5.579">continually pointing the finger at the</text>
  <text start="593.269" dur="6.72">Fed he is putting the spotlight on them</text>
  <text start="596.749" dur="7.83">think about what Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="599.989" dur="9.6">have done so far they have reworked the</text>
  <text start="604.579" dur="9.36">trade deals he&amp;#39;s created new deals or</text>
  <text start="609.589" dur="8.15">reworked old deals and he is using</text>
  <text start="613.939" dur="9.56">tariffs against the central bank system</text>
  <text start="617.739" dur="8.741">their trade deals and every time</text>
  <text start="623.499" dur="5.65">something happens in the economy every</text>
  <text start="626.48" dur="4.949">time he wants the economy to get better</text>
  <text start="629.149" dur="5.34">and better and better in this central</text>
  <text start="631.429" dur="5.22">bank system he points to the central</text>
  <text start="634.489" dur="5.88">bank and he&amp;#39;s doing this on purpose</text>
  <text start="636.649" dur="7.56">there are no coincidences he is building</text>
  <text start="640.369" dur="7.2">the narrative right now and the central</text>
  <text start="644.209" dur="5.31">banks as we move forward they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="647.569" dur="4.2">just gonna sit down and take this we</text>
  <text start="649.519" dur="4.29">know this the central banks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="651.769" dur="4.201">going to fight back and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="653.809" dur="4.921">fight back dirty they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="655.97" dur="7.289">stop them any way they possibly can and</text>
  <text start="658.73" dur="8.389">yes they use events yes they will to try</text>
  <text start="663.259" dur="7.29">just to destroy these trade deals</text>
  <text start="667.119" dur="5.8">remember each of these countries they</text>
  <text start="670.549" dur="4.861">have a private western central bank in</text>
  <text start="672.919" dur="6.121">these countries there&amp;#39;s also the deep</text>
  <text start="675.41" dur="5.369">state Trump is battling all of this and</text>
  <text start="679.04" dur="3.599">I&amp;#39;m not just saying him alone the</text>
  <text start="680.779" dur="5.55">Patriots are battling all of this and</text>
  <text start="682.639" dur="5.221">this is why during this reset everything</text>
  <text start="686.329" dur="3.781">is going to look like it&amp;#39;s in chaos</text>
  <text start="687.86" dur="6.99">because when you&amp;#39;re making a change from</text>
  <text start="690.11" dur="6.5">one system to another and the other side</text>
  <text start="694.85" dur="5.48">is fighting</text>
  <text start="696.61" dur="6.06">they create chaos and they try to make</text>
  <text start="700.33" dur="4.89">it look like everything that Trump and</text>
  <text start="702.67" dur="5.359">the Patriots are doing is not good for</text>
  <text start="705.22" dur="7.47">the people but again think mirror</text>
  <text start="708.029" dur="8.74">actually it is the opposite and we can</text>
  <text start="712.69" dur="8.82">see it has begun around the world once</text>
  <text start="716.769" dur="9.271">the UK ditches the EU with a No Deal</text>
  <text start="721.51" dur="5.79">brexit once Italy says you know</text>
  <text start="726.04" dur="5.18">something we just watch what happened</text>
  <text start="727.3" dur="7.979">with the UK we are now ditching the EU</text>
  <text start="731.22" dur="6.369">once this starts and I do believe this</text>
  <text start="735.279" dur="4.231">is all part of the plan because you have</text>
