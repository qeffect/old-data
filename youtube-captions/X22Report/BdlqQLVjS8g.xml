  <text start="144.14" dur="5.46">something we do not want to be cyprus</text>
  <text start="146.74" dur="5.44">they&amp;#39;re looking for ways of keeping</text>

  <text start="172.269" dur="5.881">economists are saying that the whole</text>
  <text start="174.76" dur="5.819">thing might just crumble apart and this</text>

  <text start="180.579" dur="4.8">is still working with the ECB the IMF</text>
  <text start="183.34" dur="8.52">they can&amp;#39;t come to any type of decision</text>
  <text start="185.379" dur="9.841">and right now the idea of going inside</text>
  <text start="191.86" dur="7.05">the banks is looking better and better</text>
  <text start="195.22" dur="5.489">to the central bankers some eurozone</text>
  <text start="198.91" dur="5.54">finance ministers are saying you know</text>

  <text start="214.359" dur="4.231">the banks and we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="216.879" dur="4.711">watch this very carefully and see and</text>
  <text start="218.59" dur="4.679">and see how this turns out because at</text>
  <text start="221.59" dur="3.72">this point in time unless they pull</text>
  <text start="223.269" dur="3.451">something out of their magical hat I</text>
  <text start="225.31" dur="5.19">don&amp;#39;t know how they&amp;#39;re going to get</text>
  <text start="226.72" dur="5.82">through all of this according to the</text>
  <text start="230.5" dur="5.489">National Confederation of Hellenic</text>
  <text start="232.54" dur="5.759">commerce what are we seeing in Greece</text>
  <text start="235.989" dur="6.78">right now well greased right now is</text>
  <text start="238.299" dur="8.991">losing 20 2.3 million euros from its</text>

  <text start="262.18" dur="8.48">month it&amp;#39;s 18,000 every year 215,000</text>
  <text start="267.58" dur="7.32">jobs lost nothing created whatsoever</text>

  <text start="274.9" dur="7.829">trade fell by 37.1 and car sales dropped</text>
  <text start="278.889" dur="6.96">by sixty one point nine percent at the</text>
  <text start="282.729" dur="6.181">same time all of this is happening Greek</text>
  <text start="285.849" dur="7.37">banks reject ninety-five percent of loan</text>
  <text start="288.91" dur="8.49">applications so what are we seeing here</text>
  <text start="293.219" dur="5.621">Greece is in a major major collapse</text>
  <text start="297.4" dur="4.109">situation they&amp;#39;ve been collapsing all</text>
  <text start="298.84" dur="4.799">this time even though the IMF the ECB</text>
  <text start="301.509" dur="3.66">every time they kept pouring on more and</text>
  <text start="303.639" dur="5.191">more debt they&amp;#39;ve been telling us that</text>
  <text start="305.169" dur="7.021">no grease is just fine there okay then</text>
  <text start="308.83" dur="8.33">we see positive GDP two percent three</text>
  <text start="312.19" dur="9.63">percent and reality is no all of that is</text>
  <text start="317.16" dur="9.52">completely fake they are in a complete</text>

  <text start="335.38" dur="8.48">can get out a business loan a house loan</text>
  <text start="338.68" dur="5.18">or anything else to help the situation</text>
  <text start="344.34" dur="7.15">basically this is what a collapse looks</text>
  <text start="348.19" dur="7.88">like everything completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="351.49" dur="8.73">and the people there are struggling</text>
  <text start="356.07" dur="6.069">212,000 897 Greeks have so far submitted</text>
  <text start="360.22" dur="5.94">requests to be part of the humanitarian</text>
  <text start="362.139" dur="6.721">crisis relief program the majority of</text>
  <text start="366.16" dur="4.5">the needy seek help with food some need</text>
  <text start="368.86" dur="4.86">financial aid to pay for the rent and</text>
  <text start="370.66" dur="5.49">even a smaller percentage needs some</text>
  <text start="373.72" dur="4.89">electricity to keep the lights on in</text>
  <text start="376.15" dur="5.88">their home and a lot of these people</text>
  <text start="378.61" dur="6.36">aren&amp;#39;t even in their homes because they</text>
  <text start="382.03" dur="5.4">couldn&amp;#39;t keep up with the cost because</text>
  <text start="384.97" dur="5.4">they have no jobs because of the</text>
  <text start="387.43" dur="7.56">austerity that was pushed on the people</text>
  <text start="390.37" dur="7.38">and it&amp;#39;s very very difficult to live</text>
  <text start="394.99" dur="5.33">through this type of situation but</text>
  <text start="397.75" dur="6.87">essential bankers what do they care as</text>
  <text start="400.32" dur="7.12">long as they push dead out and they have</text>
  <text start="404.62" dur="5.34">these countries pay the debt with</text>
  <text start="407.44" dur="5.64">interest on top that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s all I</text>
  <text start="409.96" dur="5.55">care about they come in you can&amp;#39;t pay</text>
  <text start="413.08" dur="4.74">the debt we will take parts of the</text>
  <text start="415.51" dur="5.129">country and we see this happening in</text>
  <text start="417.82" dur="4.409">more and more countries because</text>
  <text start="420.639" dur="3.301">basically what&amp;#39;s happening is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="422.229" dur="5.25">running out of places to push this debt</text>
  <text start="423.94" dur="5.84">this is why you&amp;#39;re seeing regime change</text>
  <text start="427.479" dur="4.791">in a lot of these countries like Ukraine</text>
  <text start="429.78" dur="4.56">they would like it in Venezuela because</text>
  <text start="432.27" dur="5.58">they need more and more countries to</text>
  <text start="434.34" dur="6.329">push this debt here in the United States</text>
  <text start="437.85" dur="7.16">what are we seeing we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="440.669" dur="7.741">college graduates they can&amp;#39;t find jobs</text>
  <text start="445.01" dur="6.04">the student loan delinquency is rising</text>
  <text start="448.41" dur="7.47">and right now there&amp;#39;s a new survey</text>
  <text start="451.05" dur="6.24">saying about half of students expect to</text>
  <text start="455.88" dur="4.94">be supported financially by their</text>
  <text start="457.29" dur="9.12">parents for two years or more after</text>
  <text start="460.82" dur="8.71">graduation what does this tell us the</text>
  <text start="466.41" dur="6.21">kids coming out of college cannot find</text>
  <text start="469.53" dur="5.78">work they have student loans they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="472.62" dur="4.95">make it on their own and their kin the</text>
  <text start="475.31" dur="4">central banker is the US government</text>
  <text start="477.57" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince is that this</text>
  <text start="479.31" dur="5.28">will be the new normal well why does it</text>
  <text start="481.95" dur="5.24">have to be the new normal if we get rid</text>
  <text start="484.59" dur="6.66">of the central bank and we get rid of</text>
  <text start="487.19" dur="7.62">this debt system this doesn&amp;#39;t have to be</text>
  <text start="491.25" dur="7.05">this way because the dollar has devalued</text>
  <text start="494.81" dur="7.27">quite a bit and as the value of the</text>
  <text start="498.3" dur="5.67">dollar continually declines it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="502.08" dur="5.31">to get worse and worse as time goes on</text>
  <text start="503.97" dur="8.449">and we&amp;#39;ve seen this it has not gotten</text>
  <text start="507.39" dur="8.37">better whatsoever is only gotten worse</text>
  <text start="512.419" dur="5.531">look at the elderly those people who are</text>
  <text start="515.76" dur="3.48">retiring at this time they thought they</text>
  <text start="517.95" dur="3.719">were going to have this great retirement</text>
  <text start="519.24" dur="4.38">plan you&amp;#39;re going to be able to live the</text>
  <text start="521.669" dur="4.321">rest of their life you know someplace</text>
  <text start="523.62" dur="4.14">where they didn&amp;#39;t have to worry and most</text>
  <text start="525.99" dur="4.4">of them are getting no returns on their</text>
  <text start="527.76" dur="5.1">money their money doesn&amp;#39;t go that far</text>
  <text start="530.39" dur="4.78">inflation in the supermarket&amp;#39;s is making</text>
  <text start="532.86" dur="6.66">it very tough to continually buy food so</text>
  <text start="535.17" dur="6.84">they have to take on a second job it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="539.52" dur="6.3">getting worse and worse as time goes on</text>
  <text start="542.01" dur="6.06">we see Walmart is out there and their</text>
  <text start="545.82" dur="3.72">revenue is declining now of course they</text>
  <text start="548.07" dur="4.05">had all the excuses that it was the bad</text>
  <text start="549.54" dur="5.01">weather it was because people weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="552.12" dur="4.65">getting their taxes on time while all</text>
  <text start="554.55" dur="5.99">these excuses are completely running out</text>
  <text start="556.77" dur="6.3">and their income their revenue</text>
  <text start="560.54" dur="6.81">continually drops their sales</text>
  <text start="563.07" dur="7.65">are plummeting we see this in McDonald&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="567.35" dur="6.07">why is this well as more and more people</text>
  <text start="570.72" dur="6.18">are being laid off they just don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="573.42" dur="5.91">the disposable income to spend that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="576.9" dur="7.31">the economy is falling apart I mean we</text>
  <text start="579.33" dur="8.55">were seeing more layoffs we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>

  <text start="612.09" dur="5.28">going to be harder and harder for people</text>
  <text start="614.19" dur="5.4">to make it and again we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot</text>
  <text start="617.37" dur="4.5">of retail closures where are these</text>
  <text start="619.59" dur="5.61">people going to get jobs as more retail</text>
  <text start="621.87" dur="6.57">shops close up the jobs are limited but</text>
  <text start="625.2" dur="5.34">of course the US government the central</text>
  <text start="628.44" dur="3.69">bankers are out there they are trying to</text>
  <text start="630.54" dur="5.31">convince us that everything is fine and</text>
  <text start="632.13" dur="7.92">all of a sudden today we see housing</text>
  <text start="635.85" dur="6.66">starts explode to recovery highs the</text>
  <text start="640.05" dur="6.63">highest since november two thousand</text>
  <text start="642.51" dur="5.37">seven jumping 20.2 percent month on</text>
  <text start="646.68" dur="4.14">month this is the second biggest</text>
  <text start="647.88" dur="6.36">month-on-month jump in history now we</text>
  <text start="650.82" dur="6.99">saw this with a gdp and we know that</text>
  <text start="654.24" dur="6.78">this is completely manipulated because</text>
  <text start="657.81" dur="7.89">it really doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense I mean</text>
  <text start="661.02" dur="8.06">housing starts are increasing</text>
  <text start="665.7" dur="5.46">dramatically while lumber prices are</text>
  <text start="669.08" dur="6.22">decreasing they&amp;#39;re going in the opposite</text>
  <text start="671.16" dur="8.07">direction lumber demand is decreasing so</text>
  <text start="675.3" dur="5.94">something is not right here and when we</text>
  <text start="679.23" dur="3.87">look closer at this and of course the</text>
  <text start="681.24" dur="4.47">corporate media is out there saying oh</text>
  <text start="683.1" dur="5.34">my god housings back on track it is</text>

  <text start="696.54" dur="6.24">it&amp;#39;s in many locations but not every</text>
  <text start="698.85" dur="6.81">location and we saw this going into 2007</text>
  <text start="702.78" dur="4.89">going into 2008 where there are certain</text>
  <text start="705.66" dur="4.44">parts of the country where people were</text>
  <text start="707.67" dur="5.1">like a everything is fine we have</text>
  <text start="710.1" dur="6.06">multiple offers everything seems great</text>
  <text start="712.77" dur="8.31">and in other parts traffic completely</text>
  <text start="716.16" dur="7.74">dried up we are seeing this today I</text>
  <text start="721.08" dur="10.2">looked around the country and I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>

  <text start="739.8" dur="7.86">started 800 they came all the way down</text>
  <text start="742.11" dur="7.05">to 675 some houses are still dropping</text>
  <text start="747.66" dur="6">their prices because they can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="749.16" dur="9.32">anyone and this will spread across the</text>
  <text start="753.66" dur="9.56">country when we look closer at the new</text>
  <text start="758.48" dur="8.02">privately-owned housing that where they</text>
  <text start="763.22" dur="6.31">starts we see something very strange</text>
  <text start="766.5" dur="5.64">happening in 2006 at the height of the</text>
  <text start="769.53" dur="7.23">market we see 2.1 million private</text>

  <text start="1177.999" dur="6.81">blame it on another country or group</text>
  <text start="1180.179" dur="7.771">this is what they&amp;#39;re planning to do now</text>
  <text start="1184.809" dur="6.99">we understand the US government is</text>
  <text start="1187.95" dur="5.53">trying to basically control the internet</text>
  <text start="1191.799" dur="4.11">now they have control of the creation of</text>

  <text start="1197.35" dur="4.169">or the propaganda they give us in the</text>
  <text start="1199.84" dur="4.5">corporate media and the last thing they</text>
  <text start="1201.519" dur="4.921">need to tame is the internet the</text>
  <text start="1204.34" dur="7.77">alternative meeting the new media and we</text>
  <text start="1206.44" dur="11.099">understand the FEC came out and they</text>
  <text start="1212.11" dur="9.689">were basically putting together a net</text>
  <text start="1217.539" dur="8.1">neutrality law that says okay the</text>
  <text start="1221.799" dur="6.96">internet now is a utility and all of</text>
  <text start="1225.639" dur="5.541">this is being done to basically limit</text>
  <text start="1228.759" dur="5.151">free speech the FEC</text>

  <text start="1239.13" dur="6.77">such as the drudge report for regulation</text>

  <text start="1245.9" dur="5.86">running a new site or even a chat room</text>
  <text start="1248.64" dur="6.87">could face stifling FEC regulation on</text>

  <text start="1255.51" dur="3.03">go forth with this which it kind of</text>
  <text start="1257.61" dur="2.79">looks like they&amp;#39;re heading in that</text>
  <text start="1258.54" dur="4.68">direction because what other reason</text>
  <text start="1260.4" dur="4.89">would they do this of course one of the</text>
  <text start="1263.22" dur="3.74">reasons would be a tax but what the</text>
  <text start="1265.29" dur="4.14">other reason is to control what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1266.96" dur="4.75">occurring on the internet other</text>
  <text start="1269.43" dur="5.25">countries are already doing this they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1281.27" dur="6.52">the FEC regulation on online political</text>

  <text start="1298.26" dur="5.28">attacks FEC bureaucrats could force even</text>
  <text start="1301.35" dur="4.08">smaller time bloggers and other</text>
  <text start="1303.54" dur="3.99">activists who might be involved in</text>
  <text start="1305.43" dur="6.2">writing about elections or candidates to</text>
  <text start="1307.53" dur="7.14">obey a never-ending deluge of federal</text>
  <text start="1311.63" dur="5.5">regulations and they will never be able</text>
  <text start="1314.67" dur="5.79">to get their message out actually they</text>
  <text start="1317.13" dur="7.17">could just shut me down if they go forth</text>
  <text start="1320.46" dur="8.48">with this and make us follow regulations</text>
  <text start="1324.3" dur="7.65">get licenses they would be impossible to</text>
  <text start="1328.94" dur="5.56">have this YouTube channel and to have</text>
  <text start="1331.95" dur="5.1">this site and have this report I am just</text>
  <text start="1334.5" dur="4.47">one person I do not have the funds to go</text>
  <text start="1337.05" dur="4.23">through all their hoops and keep this</text>
  <text start="1338.97" dur="6.39">going it would be completely impossible</text>
  <text start="1341.28" dur="5.67">and you can see this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1345.36" dur="4.92">trying to do because a lot of the</text>
  <text start="1346.95" dur="6.39">alternative media new media they are one</text>
  <text start="1350.28" dur="6.87">two three maybe four people putting this</text>
  <text start="1353.34" dur="5.85">together giving you reports trying to</text>
  <text start="1357.15" dur="5.82">get the word out there of what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1359.19" dur="6.18">going on and they know they need to stop</text>
  <text start="1362.97" dur="6.089">this and this is why they</text>
  <text start="1365.37" dur="7.64">been pushing for this all along now</text>
  <text start="1369.059" dur="7.111">Obama was visiting Camden New Jersey and</text>
  <text start="1373.01" dur="4.9">he announced plans to put in place new</text>
  <text start="1376.17" dur="5.37">restrictions on the use of military</text>
  <text start="1377.91" dur="6.72">equipment by police departments now of</text>
  <text start="1381.54" dur="4.62">course uh just six months ago President</text>
  <text start="1384.63" dur="3.6">Obama was discussed increasing the</text>
  <text start="1386.16" dur="5.55">funding for militarization of America&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1388.23" dur="5.13">police force but right now Obama is out</text>
  <text start="1391.71" dur="4.2">there and he sees what&amp;#39;s going on and</text>
  <text start="1393.36" dur="5.31">he&amp;#39;s saying that you know oh he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1395.91" dur="5.33">to basically ban police use of certain</text>
  <text start="1398.67" dur="5.07">equipment and some of the equipment is</text>
  <text start="1401.24" dur="5.53">explosive resistant vehicles with</text>
  <text start="1403.74" dur="8.58">tracked wheels like those seen on army</text>
  <text start="1406.77" dur="9.48">tanks and he&amp;#39;s going to basically been</text>
  <text start="1412.32" dur="6.45">other types of weapons and for other</text>
  <text start="1416.25" dur="8.059">types of equipment that are aren&amp;#39;t under</text>
  <text start="1418.77" dur="11.72">this ban such as MRAP riot shield</text>
  <text start="1424.309" dur="8.321">fatigues armored machine guns</text>
  <text start="1430.49" dur="4.87">departments will now have to provide</text>
  <text start="1432.63" dur="4.38">added justification for their use so</text>
  <text start="1435.36" dur="7.05">basically what he did was absolutely</text>
  <text start="1437.01" dur="9.84">nothing he&amp;#39;s still uh militarizing the</text>
  <text start="1442.41" dur="7.68">police he&amp;#39;s still having the police get</text>
  <text start="1446.85" dur="5.22">everything they need and all they have</text>
  <text start="1450.09" dur="3.15">to do is justify why they need it and</text>
  <text start="1452.07" dur="6.3">they can make up any reason whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1453.24" dur="7.29">and that is fine so basically Obama what</text>
  <text start="1458.37" dur="4.05">he&amp;#39;s saying is that police aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1460.53" dur="6.54">allowed to buy the Bradley troop</text>
  <text start="1462.42" dur="7.139">transports and the m1a1 tank but</text>
  <text start="1467.07" dur="6.84">everything else all it needs is an</text>
  <text start="1469.559" dur="7.081">explanation and they could have whatever</text>
  <text start="1473.91" dur="4.26">they want that&amp;#39;s basically what it is</text>
  <text start="1476.64" dur="2.64">and of course the corporate media is out</text>
  <text start="1478.17" dur="4.74">there trying to convince everyone that</text>
  <text start="1479.28" dur="6.36">oh my god see everything is fine no this</text>
  <text start="1482.91" dur="6.84">is furthest from the truth it&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="1485.64" dur="6.69">the same as it was all they have to do</text>
  <text start="1489.75" dur="5.85">is write up a small explanation and</text>
  <text start="1492.33" dur="6.11">they&amp;#39;re back in business the police are</text>
  <text start="1495.6" dur="2.84">militarized</text>
  <text start="1498.53" dur="5.68">we see that obama has just signed into</text>
  <text start="1502.41" dur="4.89">law a measure to create a nationwide</text>
  <text start="1504.21" dur="6.18">alert system to help catch anyone who</text>
  <text start="1507.3" dur="5.73">hurts kills or makes credible threats</text>
  <text start="1510.39" dur="4.23">against police officer it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="1513.03" dur="4.17">the AMBER Alert it will send an alert</text>
  <text start="1514.62" dur="5.46">system around well I have nothing</text>
  <text start="1517.2" dur="6.5">against the police my father was in the</text>
  <text start="1520.08" dur="7.83">auxiliary police my wife&amp;#39;s grandfather</text>
  <text start="1523.7" dur="6.37">uncle police chiefs and they were part</text>
  <text start="1527.91" dur="4.8">of the community they work with the</text>
  <text start="1530.07" dur="5.07">community and what we&amp;#39;re seeing today is</text>
  <text start="1532.71" dur="7.05">something completely opposite now every</text>
  <text start="1535.14" dur="8.37">police officer is not a bad person but</text>
  <text start="1539.76" dur="7.53">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is basically</text>
  <text start="1543.51" dur="6.9">the militarization of local police to</text>
  <text start="1547.29" dur="5.22">come in line with the federal mandate</text>
  <text start="1550.41" dur="4.41">and basically the government wants to</text>
  <text start="1552.51" dur="5.64">control what is going on in the local</text>
  <text start="1554.82" dur="5.67">law enforcement arena here and we can</text>
  <text start="1558.15" dur="6.24">see that they set up this alert system</text>
  <text start="1560.49" dur="5.94">so now if anyone you know makes a thread</text>
  <text start="1564.39" dur="4.23">or talks back to an officer they can set</text>
  <text start="1566.43" dur="4.8">the alert system off what happens when a</text>
  <text start="1568.62" dur="4.53">police officer which we&amp;#39;ve seen in many</text>
  <text start="1571.23" dur="5.1">videos and this is why we see a lot of</text>
  <text start="1573.15" dur="7.62">protesting and Ferguson in Baltimore</text>
  <text start="1576.33" dur="6.21">when a police officer covers up their</text>
  <text start="1580.77" dur="4.74">own crumb should there be an alert</text>
  <text start="1582.54" dur="5.06">system where the people can say okay we</text>
  <text start="1585.51" dur="4.92">just spotted something and guess what</text>
  <text start="1587.6" dur="4.99">they&amp;#39;re covering up a crime they just</text>
  <text start="1590.43" dur="5.04">killed someone for no reason whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1592.59" dur="4.14">because you have to remember if a person</text>
  <text start="1595.47" dur="4.83">does not have a weapon they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1596.73" dur="7.26">shooting back they&amp;#39;re innocent they</text>
  <text start="1600.3" dur="6">haven&amp;#39;t done anything and the police</text>
  <text start="1603.99" dur="5.49">need to respect those people who say I</text>
  <text start="1606.3" dur="6.57">resist I&amp;#39;m not resisting I&amp;#39;m going along</text>
  <text start="1609.48" dur="5.04">with you please don&amp;#39;t hurt me and the</text>
  <text start="1612.87" dur="6.53">police you know put their knee on their</text>
  <text start="1614.52" dur="7.53">heads hit them taser them continuously</text>
  <text start="1619.4" dur="4.54">there needs to be something out there to</text>
  <text start="1622.05" dur="4.38">say listen we just spotted something</text>
  <text start="1623.94" dur="6.96">going on here so it seems there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1626.43" dur="7.17">little bit of a communication problem</text>
  <text start="1630.9" dur="5.54">with what is going on here and that</text>
  <text start="1633.6" dur="7.56">problem is is they want all of this</text>
  <text start="1636.44" dur="8.08">reported to keep an eye on what is going</text>
  <text start="1641.16" dur="6.6">on and who is going to be a threat to</text>
  <text start="1644.52" dur="5.43">their authority and they want to keep</text>
  <text start="1647.76" dur="4.17">track of those people so if you see an</text>
  <text start="1649.95" dur="4.35">incident going down the alert system</text>
  <text start="1651.93" dur="4.23">goes off and who knows maybe something</text>
  <text start="1654.3" dur="5.1">like a kill switch will be tied to this</text>
  <text start="1656.16" dur="5.99">we&amp;#39;re all cameras will just basically</text>
  <text start="1659.4" dur="5.37">blackout and you won&amp;#39;t even see anything</text>
  <text start="1662.15" dur="5.55">so we can see where they&amp;#39;re trying to go</text>
  <text start="1664.77" dur="7.8">with this and what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="1667.7" dur="9">now Morrell who worked for the president</text>
  <text start="1672.57" dur="8.25">uh the former president george w bush as</text>
  <text start="1676.7" dur="6.52">a intelligence briefer in 2001 and was</text>

  <text start="1690.18" dur="7.74">black sites basically every single</text>
  <text start="1693.57" dur="7.11">government knew about it and they went</text>
  <text start="1697.92" dur="5.61">along with it and they knew exactly what</text>
  <text start="1700.68" dur="5.64">was going on and of course all these</text>
  <text start="1703.53" dur="5.16">countries are saying we have no clue we</text>
  <text start="1706.32" dur="4.83">had no idea well I can&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="1708.69" dur="6.03">something like this is ever set up</text>
  <text start="1711.15" dur="6.09">without the certain government bodies</text>
  <text start="1714.72" dur="5.52">understanding and knowing what is going</text>
  <text start="1717.24" dur="7.32">on in their country so we can see at</text>
  <text start="1720.24" dur="8.43">this point that every country absolutely</text>
  <text start="1724.56" dur="8.58">knows if they have a CIA black site in</text>
  <text start="1728.67" dur="8.61">their country now John Kerry is out</text>

  <text start="1748.44" dur="5.43">themselves against China and North Korea</text>
  <text start="1750.75" dur="5.19">this is the fad system and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1753.87" dur="7.17">to give keep it in place at this time</text>
  <text start="1755.94" dur="8.05">and they&amp;#39;re going to basically use this</text>
  <text start="1761.04" dur="4.36">to contain China North Korea</text>
  <text start="1763.99" dur="5.58">and we can see right now they&amp;#39;re placing</text>
  <text start="1765.4" dur="6.659">all the military assets into position we</text>
  <text start="1769.57" dur="4.98">see out in Ukraine that the Ukrainian</text>

  <text start="2106.65" dur="5.669">for an offensive they need some more</text>
  <text start="2108.359" dur="5.641">time it looks strange to the world that</text>
  <text start="2112.319" dur="3.111">the United States wasn&amp;#39;t involved in the</text>

  <text start="2192.18" dur="6.93">lying and still to the end try to get</text>
  <text start="2196.38" dur="5.34">their way and i think this is where they</text>

  <text start="2201.72" dur="6.27">hope and I pray that they will back off</text>
  <text start="2205.2" dur="5.85">they never do even if it looks like they</text>
  <text start="2207.99" dur="5.82">do they just never do it may look at</text>

  <text start="2691.21" dur="7.35">were brought to Israel to seek medical</text>
  <text start="2694.3" dur="7.68">attention so we can see right now they</text>
  <text start="2698.56" dur="6.66">are protecting the proxy army that is</text>
  <text start="2701.98" dur="4.74">what they are doing we see the United</text>
  <text start="2705.22" dur="3.81">States government central bankers are</text>
  <text start="2706.72" dur="9.44">continuing with the propaganda against</text>
  <text start="2709.03" dur="11.28">China they basically indicted these six</text>

  <text start="2731.86" dur="3.51">bringing all these countries into the</text>

  <text start="2748.66" dur="5.07">other players will be brought into this</text>
  <text start="2750.61" dur="5.04">because eventually when all else fails</text>
  <text start="2753.73" dur="3.39">and they can&amp;#39;t prop up the system any</text>
  <text start="2755.65" dur="4.26">longer and it really starts to fall</text>
  <text start="2757.12" dur="4.5">apart they will become desperate they</text>
  <text start="2759.91" dur="3.72">will make their move they will have the</text>
  <text start="2761.62" dur="5.46">event this is why we see the build-up of</text>
  <text start="2763.63" dur="6.57">the Islamic state coming here to the</text>
  <text start="2767.08" dur="5.91">United States because they really need</text>

  <text start="2772.99" dur="4.62">into Iran if the p5 plus one doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
