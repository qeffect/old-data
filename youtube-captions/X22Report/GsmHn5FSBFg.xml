  <text start="60.089" dur="5.791">gonna have to believe President Obama</text>
  <text start="62.25" dur="6.39">when he says we are in recovery now as I</text>
  <text start="65.88" dur="5.25">said before when we&amp;#39;re in a recovery you</text>
  <text start="68.64" dur="5.39">feel it you feel secure in your job</text>
  <text start="71.13" dur="5.699">those coming out of college they have</text>
  <text start="74.03" dur="5.079">the ability to get a job they have the</text>
  <text start="76.829" dur="4.53">ability to pay off their loans we see</text>
  <text start="79.109" dur="4.141">that many people right now don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="81.359" dur="3.391">this ability they&amp;#39;ve been looking and</text>
  <text start="83.25" dur="3.329">looking and looking and there is</text>
  <text start="84.75" dur="3.84">absolutely nothing they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="86.579" dur="4.261">manipulating a lot of the statistics</text>
  <text start="88.59" dur="4.23">right now like unemployment GDP</text>
  <text start="90.84" dur="4.139">inflation they&amp;#39;re telling us that</text>
  <text start="92.82" dur="4.92">manufacturing is doing a lot better</text>
  <text start="94.979" dur="4.801">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us that this</text>
  <text start="97.74" dur="3.57">holiday season is going to be a great</text>
  <text start="99.78" dur="4.259">holiday season of course what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="101.31" dur="4.439">doing is they&amp;#39;re pushing the gas prices</text>
  <text start="104.039" dur="3.421">down trying to make everyone feel like</text>
  <text start="105.749" dur="3.75">they have more money in their pockets so</text>
  <text start="107.46" dur="5.06">they go out and spend this and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="109.499" dur="5.19">going to see once the new year starts</text>
  <text start="112.52" dur="4.479">probably in February March we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="114.689" dur="4.53">to see a lot of stores closing down a</text>
  <text start="116.999" dur="4.171">lot of stores that didn&amp;#39;t make it but</text>
  <text start="119.219" dur="3.241">but the government the central bankers</text>
  <text start="121.17" dur="3.899">and I still try to convince us that</text>
  <text start="122.46" dur="5.339">we&amp;#39;re doing everything the right way</text>
  <text start="125.069" dur="4.681">we&amp;#39;re in a recovery and this is normal</text>
  <text start="127.799" dur="5.371">for a recovery when everything shuts</text>
  <text start="129.75" dur="5.76">down one thing they can&amp;#39;t touch and they</text>
  <text start="133.17" dur="3.899">can&amp;#39;t manipulate is the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="135.51" dur="3.899">and we&amp;#39;ve been covering this for quite a</text>
  <text start="137.069" dur="3.811">while we have been noticing that the</text>
  <text start="139.409" dur="4.591">bolted right index is</text>
  <text start="140.88" dur="4.53">newly falling right now it was at seven</text>
  <text start="144" dur="3.84">hundred and eighty eight points fell</text>
  <text start="145.41" dur="5.01">another six points were at 782 and</text>
  <text start="147.84" dur="4.83">something important to realize is that</text>
  <text start="150.42" dur="5.22">when we were in that Great Recession of</text>
  <text start="152.67" dur="4.8">2008 which we&amp;#39;re really still in we went</text>
  <text start="155.64" dur="3.36">from eleven thousand points all the way</text>
  <text start="157.47" dur="4.77">down to six hundred and forty-seven we</text>
  <text start="159" dur="5.88">are at 782 right now and we have to</text>
  <text start="162.24" dur="4.61">remember the Baltic Dry Index is raw</text>
  <text start="164.88" dur="5.1">material which is used for manufacturing</text>
  <text start="166.85" dur="5.32">the US government and other government</text>
  <text start="169.98" dur="4.23">central banks cannot manipulate the raw</text>
  <text start="172.17" dur="3.63">material and tell us that everything is</text>
  <text start="174.21" dur="4.32">just fine and this is why we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="175.8" dur="4.59">covering this court for quite a bit what</text>
  <text start="178.53" dur="4.14">we&amp;#39;re also seeing is that China and</text>
  <text start="180.39" dur="4.08">Russia has been separating themselves</text>
  <text start="182.67" dur="3.48">from the Western world from the private</text>
  <text start="184.47" dur="3.24">western central banks and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="186.15" dur="4.14">continually doing this of course China</text>
  <text start="187.71" dur="4.68">is making a lot of bilateral trades</text>
  <text start="190.29" dur="3.81">making agreements with many countries</text>
  <text start="192.39" dur="5.09">pumping in billions of dollars into</text>
  <text start="194.1" dur="7.77">their infrastructure bricks goes live in</text>
  <text start="197.48" dur="8.41">2015 and if we really look at this China</text>
  <text start="201.87" dur="6.51">is now the de facto IMF for the BRIC</text>
  <text start="205.89" dur="4.86">nations they&amp;#39;re setting up this bank</text>
  <text start="208.38" dur="6.32">which they&amp;#39;re investing in just like the</text>
  <text start="210.75" dur="8.46">IMF and now China is really acting like</text>
  <text start="214.7" dur="6.4">the IMF to the BRIC nations China offers</text>
  <text start="219.21" dur="4.11">Russia help with currency swap</text>

  <text start="227.82" dur="5.22">one extra step step was necessary the</text>
  <text start="230.97" dur="3.84">launching of the direct FX trade</text>
  <text start="233.04" dur="5.04">involving the Russian and Chinese</text>
  <text start="234.81" dur="6.149">currency either spot or Ford a move away</text>
  <text start="238.08" dur="4.98">from purely theoretical bilateral FX</text>
  <text start="240.959" dur="4.351">trade agreements which would not only</text>
  <text start="243.06" dur="3.78">enable and make direct currency trading</text>
  <text start="245.31" dur="4.17">more efficient by sidestepping the</text>
  <text start="246.84" dur="4.74">dollar entirely but also allow Russian</text>
  <text start="249.48" dur="5.67">companies to budget in Chinese you want</text>
  <text start="251.58" dur="5.94">terms it is no surprise then that this</text>
  <text start="255.15" dur="4.26">is precisely the missing step that was</text>
  <text start="257.52" dur="4.469">announced overnight and will be</text>

  <text start="327.5" dur="7.29">watch this very very carefully as this</text>
  <text start="330.35" dur="6.96">progresses now as we know the US</text>
  <text start="334.79" dur="5.04">government the central bankers have been</text>
  <text start="337.31" dur="4.74">dropping the oil prices trying to put</text>

  <text start="342.05" dur="4.11">much implode their economy but right now</text>
  <text start="344.51" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;re seeing the Russian ruble has</text>
  <text start="346.16" dur="5.55">rallied impressive 34% erasing most of</text>
  <text start="349.16" dur="4.26">the dramatic devaluation in the past</text>
  <text start="351.71" dur="4.26">couple of weeks and it seems like things</text>
  <text start="353.42" dur="5.04">are getting met much much better but we</text>
  <text start="355.97" dur="4.5">see the sanctions are taking place</text>
  <text start="358.46" dur="4.47">because we have to remember Obama signed</text>
  <text start="360.47" dur="4.86">that spending bill and in that in</text>
  <text start="362.93" dur="4.38">include sanctions on Crimea and right</text>
  <text start="365.33" dur="3.75">now MasterCard and Visa have suspended</text>
  <text start="367.31" dur="4.17">service for Russian banks in Crimea</text>
  <text start="369.08" dur="5.31">saying the decision complies with us</text>
  <text start="371.48" dur="5.19">sanctions this means that we can no</text>
  <text start="374.39" dur="5.61">longer issue or accept bank cards in</text>
  <text start="376.67" dur="8.04">Crimea and service them in the atms and</text>
  <text start="380" dur="7.86">we have to remember Russia knew this was</text>
  <text start="384.71" dur="5.16">coming and I can&amp;#39;t believe visa master</text>
  <text start="387.86" dur="3.78">guarded going along with this because we</text>
  <text start="389.87" dur="3.42">thought they might have learned their</text>
  <text start="391.64" dur="4.23">lesson from the last time they tried to</text>
  <text start="393.29" dur="4.29">do this and they lost all they well they</text>
  <text start="395.87" dur="4.62">were going to lose a lot of business in</text>
  <text start="397.58" dur="5.46">Russia and we have to remember Russia</text>
  <text start="400.49" dur="5.66">created their own payment system which</text>
  <text start="403.04" dur="5.75">is the same as the Swift but it is</text>
  <text start="406.15" dur="4.71">question based and seems like right now</text>
  <text start="408.79" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re going to move away from swift</text>
  <text start="410.86" dur="5.96">move away from Visa MasterCard and use</text>
  <text start="413.77" dur="5.4">their own internal payment system and</text>
  <text start="416.82" dur="4.45">Visa MasterCard they&amp;#39;re going to use a</text>
  <text start="419.17" dur="4.68">lot of money now Russia might extend</text>
  <text start="421.27" dur="4.14">this after they learn that you know the</text>
  <text start="423.85" dur="3">United States has placed the sanctions</text>
  <text start="425.41" dur="3.39">and they might be discussing it and say</text>
  <text start="426.85" dur="4.02">listen why don&amp;#39;t we just disconnect</text>
  <text start="428.8" dur="3.87">ourselves completely right now and use</text>
  <text start="430.87" dur="4.62">our own payment system they tested it</text>
  <text start="432.67" dur="5.4">back on the fifteenth of December and</text>
  <text start="435.49" dur="4.29">right now they could be ready to go live</text>
  <text start="438.07" dur="4.14">and completely disassociate themselves</text>
  <text start="439.78" dur="5.25">from mastercard visa and everything else</text>
  <text start="442.21" dur="4.68">and they will lose a lot of money when I</text>
  <text start="445.03" dur="3.72">say they it&amp;#39;s mastercard and visa they</text>
  <text start="446.89" dur="5.22">would lose a lot of money by not</text>
  <text start="448.75" dur="5.73">offering this to Russia now there has</text>
  <text start="452.11" dur="6.36">been a leaked document this is the</text>

  <text start="700.33" dur="4.53">was right it means they created laws to</text>

  <text start="886.65" dur="3.87">the Patriot Act that he&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="888.39" dur="3.66">or they might have another law that is</text>

  <text start="892.05" dur="3.84">and they&amp;#39;re just going to pull it out</text>
  <text start="893.55" dur="4.5">and say ah this is why we need to take</text>
  <text start="895.89" dur="5.16">away your internet freedoms this is why</text>
  <text start="898.05" dur="5.4">we need to ban the new media this is why</text>
  <text start="901.05" dur="4.74">we need to control and fingerprint</text>
  <text start="903.45" dur="4.62">everyone going onto the internet so we</text>

  <text start="928.44" dur="5.76">rival the Panama Canal and we can see</text>
  <text start="931.35" dur="4.98">right now they will probably shift a lot</text>
  <text start="934.2" dur="4.11">of the shipping from that old canal to</text>
  <text start="936.33" dur="5.4">the newer one because that can handle</text>

  <text start="973.02" dur="4.74">of what was agreed in September has been</text>
  <text start="975.779" dur="3.931">achieved and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="977.76" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re having a very tough time they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="979.71" dur="5.879">supposed to withdraw their heavy</text>
  <text start="981.9" dur="6.39">weaponry and bring it back quite a bit</text>
  <text start="985.589" dur="4.5">so they have an 18 mile buffer zone</text>
  <text start="988.29" dur="4.049">between the two of them they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="990.089" dur="4.321">that they&amp;#39;re supposed to be Ukraine is</text>
  <text start="992.339" dur="4.351">supposed to be moving the weapons back</text>
  <text start="994.41" dur="4.85">today but we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch</text>
  <text start="996.69" dur="5.73">this and see if this actually happens</text>
  <text start="999.26" dur="6.37">now it seems like electric was cut off</text>
  <text start="1002.42" dur="6.9">in Crimea train service has been cut off</text>
  <text start="1005.63" dur="5.88">in Crimea and we could be seeing that</text>
  <text start="1009.32" dur="4.01">something is definitely going on the</text>
  <text start="1011.51" dur="4.35">region-wide blackout was first reported</text>
  <text start="1013.33" dur="4.33">Ukraine restored the power until today</text>
  <text start="1015.86" dur="3.9">when moments ago when we learned that</text>
  <text start="1017.66" dur="4.23">Ukraine cut off the electricity to</text>
  <text start="1019.76" dur="4.05">Crimea they&amp;#39;re also halting the train</text>

  <text start="1023.81" dur="4.619">just don&amp;#39;t have enough coal to support</text>
  <text start="1025.97" dur="4.14">all of this but again this could</text>
  <text start="1028.429" dur="4.741">indicate Ukraine is stepping up its</text>

  <text start="1033.17" dur="3.57">pressure on Russia we see the sanctions</text>

  <text start="1211.67" dur="5.31">able to shoot down planes and all this</text>
  <text start="1213.56" dur="6.12">is for is to pretty much create a no-fly</text>
  <text start="1216.98" dur="4.14">zone over this area and we see some</text>
  <text start="1219.68" dur="3.27">conflicting reports coming from the</text>
  <text start="1221.12" dur="3.33">Pentagon and the administration the</text>
  <text start="1222.95" dur="3.93">administration is trying to say yes a</text>
  <text start="1224.45" dur="4.53">plane was shot down armed forces are</text>
  <text start="1226.88" dur="5.58">saying no there was no plane shot down</text>
  <text start="1228.98" dur="5.01">and again we seen this happen many many</text>
  <text start="1232.46" dur="3.96">times where the administration butts</text>
  <text start="1233.99" dur="5.25">heads with Penton with the Pentagon and</text>
  <text start="1236.42" dur="4.86">we can see right now the administration</text>
  <text start="1239.24" dur="4.77">is trying to push their agenda forward</text>
  <text start="1241.28" dur="4.56">they want a no-fly zone they want to set</text>
  <text start="1244.01" dur="4.29">up a buffer zone they want to bring the</text>
  <text start="1245.84" dur="4.71">troops in there they want to get Assad</text>
  <text start="1248.3" dur="6.81">out of power and that is their whole</text>
  <text start="1250.55" dur="6.66">entire goal it is never ever changed now</text>
  <text start="1255.11" dur="6.71">we understand that South Korea they had</text>
  <text start="1257.21" dur="7.11">their nuclear plant cyber attacked and</text>
  <text start="1261.82" dur="4.33">now there&amp;#39;s looking into it saying it</text>
  <text start="1264.32" dur="3.57">could be North Korea and everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1266.15" dur="4.02">going to be blamed on North Korea right</text>
  <text start="1267.89" dur="5.19">after this Sony fiasco and we can see</text>
  <text start="1270.17" dur="6.33">right now the interview that was</text>
  <text start="1273.08" dur="6.24">released it was streamed and it seems</text>
  <text start="1276.5" dur="5.67">like all this was being done to boost</text>
  <text start="1279.32" dur="7.38">the sales of the movie it was also being</text>
  <text start="1282.17" dur="6.66">used to implicate North Korea and doing</text>
  <text start="1286.7" dur="4.8">a cyberattack so they can come down</text>
  <text start="1288.83" dur="6.21">harden them try to provoke them and we</text>
  <text start="1291.5" dur="5.43">see right now that North Korea was also</text>
  <text start="1295.04" dur="3.39">attacked and they&amp;#39;re experiencing</text>
  <text start="1296.93" dur="3.72">trouble with their internet for four</text>
  <text start="1298.43" dur="4.44">consecutive Dave&amp;#39;s already an alleged</text>
  <text start="1300.65" dur="6.45">cyber standoff with the united states</text>
  <text start="1302.87" dur="7.05">and their internet is fluctuating right</text>
  <text start="1307.1" dur="5.85">now the FBI is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1309.92" dur="5.07">saying well maybe the IP really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1312.95" dur="4.98">come from North Korea maybe it was Japan</text>
  <text start="1314.99" dur="5.85">because now we&amp;#39;re seeing that there were</text>
  <text start="1317.93" dur="5.46">Japanese servers used in this cyber</text>
  <text start="1320.84" dur="4.47">attack and we&amp;#39;ve had a lot of hackers</text>
  <text start="1323.39" dur="5.13">come out and say even anonymous come out</text>
  <text start="1325.31" dur="5.52">and say it was no way North Korea</text>
  <text start="1328.52" dur="4.56">because in an advanced actor would not</text>
  <text start="1330.83" dur="3.449">do this whatsoever they they&amp;#39;re even</text>
  <text start="1333.08" dur="3.779">saying they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="1334.279" dur="4.89">capability of doing this but there is no</text>
  <text start="1336.859" dur="5.61">way that North Korea is going to do this</text>
  <text start="1339.169" dur="4.68">and have the IP right outside of North</text>
  <text start="1342.469" dur="3.45">Korea it makes no sense even inside</text>
  <text start="1343.849" dur="3.841">North Korea they would bounce it off</text>
  <text start="1345.919" dur="3.87">many many servers they would cover their</text>
  <text start="1347.69" dur="4.979">tracks they would try to pin it on</text>
  <text start="1349.789" dur="6.72">somebody else and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="1352.669" dur="6.031">the FBI might again be wrong about what</text>
  <text start="1356.509" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;ve been talking about listen</text>
  <text start="1358.7" dur="3.719">everyone thanks a lot for listening be</text>
