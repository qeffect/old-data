  <text start="73.62" dur="6.18">geopolitical news now back a couple of</text>
  <text start="76.59" dur="5.25">weeks cue came out and cue said</text>
  <text start="79.8" dur="5.13">something that was very interesting this</text>
  <text start="81.84" dur="5.13">was back in March 4th it was post 839 do</text>
  <text start="84.93" dur="3.78">you trust the mainstream media do you</text>
  <text start="86.97" dur="6.48">trust Facebook Google YouTube Twitter</text>
  <text start="88.71" dur="7.799">and cue talked about regulation about</text>
  <text start="93.45" dur="5.07">how the social media Giants were</text>
  <text start="96.509" dur="4.741">intertwined with the intelligent agency</text>
  <text start="98.52" dur="4.56">how they were storing your private</text>
  <text start="101.25" dur="3.9">information without your permission and</text>
  <text start="103.08" dur="3.42">then the story broke about Cambridge</text>
  <text start="105.15" dur="3.44">analytical which really the Trump</text>
  <text start="106.5" dur="6.3">campaign really didn&amp;#39;t use that much</text>
  <text start="108.59" dur="8.83">compared to what other elected officials</text>
  <text start="112.8" dur="7.23">were using and the story then shifted to</text>
  <text start="117.42" dur="7.95">what Facebook has been doing all along</text>
  <text start="120.03" dur="7.68">and cue also said that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="125.37" dur="4.589">be regulating and this was way before</text>
  <text start="127.71" dur="3.51">any of this all came out that anyone</text>
  <text start="129.959" dur="4.441">even thought this was going to happen</text>
  <text start="131.22" dur="6.03">and we come to find that yes Facebook</text>
  <text start="134.4" dur="7.26">has been storing logs of phone calls</text>
  <text start="137.25" dur="6.75">text messages for years they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="141.66" dur="5.76">maintained a comprehensive record of</text>
  <text start="144" dur="4.29">phone calls and text messages on Android</text>
  <text start="147.42" dur="4.16">devices</text>
  <text start="148.29" dur="6.03">last week New Zealander Dylan McKay</text>
  <text start="151.58" dur="4.87">requested his data from Facebook upon</text>
  <text start="154.32" dur="3.479">unzipping the downloaded file McKay</text>
  <text start="156.45" dur="3.93">discovered the Facebook had stored</text>
  <text start="157.799" dur="4.791">around two years worth of metadata from</text>
  <text start="160.38" dur="5.04">phone calls he had made or received</text>
  <text start="162.59" dur="5.619">others have reported similar data log</text>
  <text start="165.42" dur="5.73">from their devices and basically they</text>
  <text start="168.209" dur="8.941">also upload and they keep your contacts</text>
  <text start="171.15" dur="8.91">this was used very often now what is</text>
  <text start="177.15" dur="4.739">happening right now is everyone is</text>
  <text start="180.06" dur="2.269">looking at this and saying whoa wait a</text>
  <text start="181.889" dur="2.581">minute</text>
  <text start="182.329" dur="3.581">you&amp;#39;ve been keeping our personal</text>
  <text start="184.47" dur="5.73">information without our permission</text>
  <text start="185.91" dur="7.92">well now just like you predicted the FTC</text>
  <text start="190.2" dur="5.67">is officially investigating Facebook for</text>
  <text start="193.83" dur="3.36">the Cambridge analytical data scandal</text>
  <text start="195.87" dur="3.18">now the Federal Trade Commission</text>
  <text start="197.19" dur="3.66">announced on Monday that has opened an</text>
  <text start="199.05" dur="5.09">investigation into Facebook and whether</text>
  <text start="200.85" dur="7.44">it violated its stated privacy policy</text>
  <text start="204.14" dur="6.94">now we see at this point that this was</text>
  <text start="208.29" dur="6.39">done on purpose noting as a coincidence</text>
  <text start="211.08" dur="6.15">and this is now going to spread to the</text>
  <text start="214.68" dur="5.97">other social media giants then you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="217.23" dur="7.32">gonna hear calls for regulations on</text>
  <text start="220.65" dur="6.45">these social media Giants and this is</text>
  <text start="224.55" dur="4.74">just the beginning so we see at this</text>
  <text start="227.1" dur="4.59">point that everything is coming true</text>
  <text start="229.29" dur="4.58">this is like a boom and it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="231.69" dur="5.37">starting to happen now as we can see</text>
  <text start="233.87" dur="6.13">McMasters was let go now he was a neocon</text>
  <text start="237.06" dur="5.13">wanted war with North Korea he was</text>
  <text start="240" dur="5.31">talking about plans going in starting a</text>
  <text start="242.19" dur="5.61">war and eventually we are now seeing</text>
  <text start="245.31" dur="6.39">peace in North Korea were scheduled for</text>
  <text start="247.8" dur="5.67">peace talks and Q has been telling us</text>
  <text start="251.7" dur="4.92">that yes we are headed in this direction</text>
  <text start="253.47" dur="5.85">we even reported on this before even Q</text>
  <text start="256.62" dur="5.16">mention is that behind the scenes they</text>
  <text start="259.32" dur="5.03">were peace talks going on now let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="261.78" dur="5.79">keep that in mind for a second that</text>
  <text start="264.35" dur="6.45">McMasters was let go we&amp;#39;re not headed to</text>
  <text start="267.57" dur="5.07">war with North Korea yes on April 1st</text>
  <text start="270.8" dur="3.75">supposedly the Pentagon has announced</text>
  <text start="272.64" dur="4.26">that they&amp;#39;re going to resume drills in</text>
  <text start="274.55" dur="5.11">South Korea now remember this is April</text>
  <text start="276.9" dur="5.37">1st as they befooled Day was this put in</text>
  <text start="279.66" dur="5.37">a place to fool the media or it was just</text>
  <text start="282.27" dur="4.71">to show everyone around the world that</text>
  <text start="285.03" dur="3.9">North Korea wasn&amp;#39;t going to fire missile</text>
  <text start="286.98" dur="5.25">was not going to test a nuclear weapon</text>
  <text start="288.93" dur="6.48">and you can see that all of this has</text>
  <text start="292.23" dur="6.66">calmed down completely so instead of</text>
  <text start="295.41" dur="7.35">McMasters we now have John Bolton John</text>
  <text start="298.89" dur="7.2">Bolton as Aniyah come he wants war he is</text>
  <text start="302.76" dur="3.66">just as bad as McMasters no doubt about</text>
  <text start="306.09" dur="3.75">it</text>
  <text start="306.42" dur="6.78">and we have to think about this why</text>
  <text start="309.84" dur="5.43">would Trump put in John Bolton now of</text>
  <text start="313.2" dur="4.92">course everyone is out there talking</text>
  <text start="315.27" dur="3.619">about because he&amp;#39;s setting his cabinet</text>
  <text start="318.12" dur="2.389">up too</text>
  <text start="318.889" dur="3.691">award well that seemed a little</text>
  <text start="320.509" dur="3.571">ridiculous because if we were gonna go</text>
  <text start="322.58" dur="5.28">to war why don&amp;#39;t we just go to war with</text>
  <text start="324.08" dur="5.79">oh wait North Korea right why would we</text>
  <text start="327.86" dur="4.44">have peace there why don&amp;#39;t we just keep</text>
  <text start="329.87" dur="5.37">McMasters why didn&amp;#39;t we just go to war</text>
  <text start="332.3" dur="7.049">they had a plan because that&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="335.24" dur="7.019">plan the plan is to bring these</text>
  <text start="339.349" dur="8.491">individuals up put them in a position to</text>
  <text start="342.259" dur="8.101">observe and watch how they operate who</text>
  <text start="347.84" dur="6.71">they are in contact with who they are</text>
  <text start="350.36" dur="9.119">taking orders from now remember Bolton</text>
  <text start="354.55" dur="8.169">he has been pushing for a regime change</text>
  <text start="359.479" dur="6.78">in Iran now let&amp;#39;s think about this for a</text>
  <text start="362.719" dur="7.741">second cue came out and said North Korea</text>
  <text start="366.259" dur="5.671">peace talks already happened and now</text>
  <text start="370.46" dur="2.989">it&amp;#39;s just a show for the corporate media</text>
  <text start="371.93" dur="5.489">and the rest of the world</text>
  <text start="373.449" dur="6.011">next stop is Iran hmm got rid of</text>
  <text start="377.419" dur="5.101">McMasters who wanted to go into North</text>
  <text start="379.46" dur="5.19">Korea start a war John Bolton has been</text>
  <text start="382.52" dur="4.35">calling for regime change in Iran so</text>
  <text start="384.65" dur="7.019">let&amp;#39;s take out McMasters bring in Bolton</text>
  <text start="386.87" dur="7.71">now phase two let&amp;#39;s have peace and calm</text>
  <text start="391.669" dur="5.761">the situation down in Iran let&amp;#39;s look at</text>
  <text start="394.58" dur="5.069">the deal that was made with Obama let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="397.43" dur="5.31">bring out the truth of why this deal was</text>
  <text start="399.649" dur="5.58">made where this money came from and what</text>
  <text start="402.74" dur="5.94">were the true intentions of pushing this</text>
  <text start="405.229" dur="7.5">deal everything of what we&amp;#39;ve been told</text>
  <text start="408.68" dur="6.599">is not really what it is the idea of oh</text>
  <text start="412.729" dur="5.46">let&amp;#39;s have this deal with Iran was not</text>
  <text start="415.279" dur="6.211">to allow Iran to have their nuclear</text>
  <text start="418.189" dur="5.85">power to allow them to live peacefully</text>
  <text start="421.49" dur="4.049">it was put into place to make sure they</text>
  <text start="424.039" dur="2.13">never got a nuclear weapon it was put</text>
  <text start="425.539" dur="3.47">into place</text>
  <text start="426.169" dur="5.43">so they can be invaded later on and</text>
  <text start="429.009" dur="6.22">basically what we&amp;#39;re looking at right</text>
  <text start="431.599" dur="7.74">now is taking this whole thing apart to</text>
  <text start="435.229" dur="7.231">see what really was done there and we</text>
  <text start="439.339" dur="5.82">can see right now Bolton would be the</text>
  <text start="442.46" dur="5.22">best pick because he is a war monger</text>
  <text start="445.159" dur="3.99">he wants regime change in Iran actually</text>
  <text start="447.68" dur="4.72">he was on video saying that we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="449.149" dur="6.701">have regime change in Iran in 2019 so</text>
  <text start="452.4" dur="7.41">why would Trump now start a war with</text>
  <text start="455.85" dur="8.189">Iran and have peace with North Korea it</text>
  <text start="459.81" dur="7.35">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="464.039" dur="4.981">going to happen most likely it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="467.16" dur="4.41">opposite of what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="469.02" dur="4.35">remember keep your friends close but</text>
  <text start="471.57" dur="4.8">your enemies closer</text>
  <text start="473.37" dur="7.829">how do you learn how the deep state the</text>
  <text start="476.37" dur="7.109">neocons work how do you learn on how</text>
  <text start="481.199" dur="4.431">they operate who they&amp;#39;re in contact with</text>
  <text start="483.479" dur="6.841">and what they are up to</text>
  <text start="485.63" dur="8.68">well you monitor them you listen to what</text>
  <text start="490.32" dur="6.75">they&amp;#39;re doing you understand how they</text>
  <text start="494.31" dur="5.69">work and then you get rid of them and</text>
  <text start="497.07" dur="7.68">you get rid of their whole entire</text>
  <text start="500" dur="8.08">apparatus below and above them that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="504.75" dur="7.919">how this works this is the strategy you</text>
  <text start="508.08" dur="7.589">use to get all these individuals just by</text>
  <text start="512.669" dur="5.821">removing this layer is meaningless you</text>
  <text start="515.669" dur="6.12">gotta go a lot deeper yella you got to</text>
  <text start="518.49" dur="5.76">go to the source always go to the source</text>
  <text start="521.789" dur="4.651">just don&amp;#39;t think of this producer</text>
  <text start="524.25" dur="4.589">spokespeople these aren&amp;#39;t the people</text>
  <text start="526.44" dur="4.92">calling the shots these are the</text>
  <text start="528.839" dur="3.661">mouthpieces of those people who hide in</text>
  <text start="531.36" dur="5.64">the shadows</text>
  <text start="532.5" dur="6.9">remember that and once you find out who</text>
  <text start="537" dur="5.69">these individuals are and you rout them</text>
  <text start="539.4" dur="6.72">out you can get rid of the puppets and</text>
  <text start="542.69" dur="5.41">you push them aside and you get rid of</text>
  <text start="546.12" dur="5.28">them and that&amp;#39;s what Trump has been</text>
  <text start="548.1" dur="7.29">doing and it&amp;#39;s going to continue to do</text>
  <text start="551.4" dur="6.45">this this has not ended by any means</text>
  <text start="555.39" dur="6.18">this is going to continue on because the</text>
  <text start="557.85" dur="6.45">deep state again is deep and you need to</text>
  <text start="561.57" dur="5.04">go to the source and the source is the</text>
  <text start="564.3" dur="3.78">central bank the sources those people</text>
  <text start="566.61" dur="3.27">who are not elected those people who</text>
  <text start="568.08" dur="5.73">stay in the shadows those people who you</text>
  <text start="569.88" dur="6.81">don&amp;#39;t see we see right now it is heating</text>
  <text start="573.81" dur="4.89">up over this scribble poisoning where of</text>
  <text start="576.69" dur="5.07">course the British authorities will not</text>
  <text start="578.7" dur="5.19">hand over anything to Russia because</text>
  <text start="581.76" dur="4.53">they don&amp;#39;t have anything because what</text>
  <text start="583.89" dur="5.639">was done there was done by</text>
  <text start="586.29" dur="5.489">the deep state maybe in the US and the</text>
  <text start="589.529" dur="4.11">British deep state combined the</text>
  <text start="591.779" dur="4.381">intelligence agencies where they used</text>
  <text start="593.639" dur="5.19">some form of poison to try to poison</text>
  <text start="596.16" dur="5.369">these individuals but we could see right</text>
  <text start="598.829" dur="4.74">now the US and other countries they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="601.529" dur="5.01">all out there saying oh yes it was</text>
  <text start="603.569" dur="4.77">definitely Russia and the US has ordered</text>
  <text start="606.539" dur="3.96">the expulsion of about 60 Russian</text>
  <text start="608.339" dur="5.91">diplomats and the closure of the Russian</text>
  <text start="610.499" dur="6.15">consulate consulate in Seattle and the</text>
  <text start="614.249" dur="5.49">u.s. wants other countries to join in on</text>
  <text start="616.649" dur="5.43">this so other countries 15 au member</text>
  <text start="619.739" dur="4.231">states Canada Ukraine also announced the</text>
  <text start="622.079" dur="4.68">expulsion of Russian diplomats Poland</text>
  <text start="623.97" dur="7.199">Lithuania what does this actually do</text>
  <text start="626.759" dur="9.06">this exposes all the countries that are</text>
  <text start="631.169" dur="8.82">still pushing the agenda against Russia</text>
  <text start="635.819" dur="7.92">it brings them out into the open now</text>
  <text start="639.989" dur="6.231">those countries who are not going to go</text>
  <text start="643.739" dur="5.49">through with this those countries well</text>
  <text start="646.22" dur="4.659">they&amp;#39;re thinking in a different way but</text>
  <text start="649.229" dur="3.991">we can see there are many countries out</text>
  <text start="650.879" dur="4.32">there that are still controlled by the</text>
  <text start="653.22" dur="4.109">deep state and to find out who they are</text>
  <text start="655.199" dur="4.17">all you need to do is set them up</text>
  <text start="657.329" dur="3.69">actually the Ukrainian regime used thus</text>
  <text start="659.369" dur="4.38">crippled case to further decrease the</text>
  <text start="661.019" dur="6.99">diplomatic relations with Russia Ukraine</text>
  <text start="663.749" dur="8.58">is full of deep state operatives so this</text>
  <text start="668.009" dur="7.23">whole thing is a test of who is still</text>
  <text start="672.329" dur="5.04">with the deep state who is not call them</text>
  <text start="675.239" dur="5.01">out on it and let&amp;#39;s see how they</text>
  <text start="677.369" dur="4.291">approach the situation now China they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="680.249" dur="3.42">not out there saying yes we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="681.66" dur="3.599">rid of all Russian diplomats they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="683.669" dur="3.931">there saying we would like to see some</text>
  <text start="685.259" dur="5.49">proof here first we would like to see</text>
  <text start="687.6" dur="5.159">some evidence and it is important to</text>
  <text start="690.749" dur="4.92">note that 12 of the 60 diplomats expel</text>
  <text start="692.759" dur="4.56">from the u.s. formed part of the Russian</text>
  <text start="695.669" dur="4.32">mission to the United Nations this move</text>
  <text start="697.319" dur="4.651">is in contrary to the basic norms of the</text>
  <text start="699.989" dur="4.19">international law and there are other</text>
  <text start="701.97" dur="4.319">countries out there in other media</text>
  <text start="704.179" dur="4.47">outlets saying we&amp;#39;ll wait a minute hold</text>
  <text start="706.289" dur="4.62">on here we haven&amp;#39;t seen any facts yet</text>
  <text start="708.649" dur="6.13">surrounding the scriptcase we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="710.909" dur="7.441">seen any evidence any proof and maybe we</text>
  <text start="714.779" dur="4.611">need some evidence to support all of</text>
  <text start="718.35" dur="5.09">this</text>
  <text start="719.39" dur="6.33">you can see that this is the push to get</text>
  <text start="723.44" dur="3.51">everyone to question this now Russia is</text>
  <text start="725.72" dur="4.73">saying that they&amp;#39;re opening up their own</text>
  <text start="726.95" dur="6.84">investigation into this case and Russian</text>
  <text start="730.45" dur="6.07">experts chemical weapons experts say</text>
  <text start="733.79" dur="6.09">that the American database database of</text>

  <text start="766.79" dur="5.3">widely reported that the Western</text>
  <text start="768.35" dur="6.38">chemical weapons expert had created an</text>
  <text start="772.09" dur="5.35">alternative version that is easily</text>
  <text start="774.73" dur="6.22">identifiable from the original Soviet</text>
  <text start="777.44" dur="6.3">design that&amp;#39;s very interesting maybe</text>
  <text start="780.95" dur="5.04">this is the reason they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="783.74" dur="5.13">hand over any samples because they&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="785.99" dur="4.83">able to identify it very easily quickly</text>
  <text start="788.87" dur="6.63">to show that no it didn&amp;#39;t come from</text>
  <text start="790.82" dur="7.23">Russia now the British government will</text>
  <text start="795.5" dur="5.43">not hand over any of this now under</text>
  <text start="798.05" dur="7.76">international law they are supposed to</text>
  <text start="800.93" dur="8.88">hand over all this evidence so the</text>
  <text start="805.81" dur="7.69">Russian Defense Ministry started to look</text>
  <text start="809.81" dur="5.49">at the database and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="813.5" dur="4.98">in this database they have everything</text>
  <text start="815.3" dur="7.35">categorized and the u.s. already had a</text>
  <text start="818.48" dur="9.2">version 80234 on file in 1998 and now</text>
  <text start="822.65" dur="8.43">that they look in there that version</text>
  <text start="827.68" dur="7.57">disappeared from the National Bureau of</text>
  <text start="831.08" dur="5.67">Standards database the exact opposite of</text>
  <text start="835.25" dur="5.16">what the Russian experts said should</text>
  <text start="836.75" dur="6.39">normally happen where that information</text>
  <text start="840.41" dur="4.32">should still be there you keep adding to</text>
  <text start="843.14" dur="4.5">the database you don&amp;#39;t remove</text>
  <text start="844.73" dur="6.06">information but for some reason this</text>
  <text start="847.64" dur="4.91">information does not exist any longer in</text>
  <text start="850.79" dur="5.479">the database some</text>
  <text start="852.55" dur="6.18">thing was tampered with so we can see</text>
  <text start="856.269" dur="6.421">already they&amp;#39;re getting caught up in all</text>
  <text start="858.73" dur="7.289">of this now out in Afghanistan we see</text>
  <text start="862.69" dur="6.54">Iran they are proposing investment in</text>
  <text start="866.019" dur="4.44">Afghan iron ore they wanted work with</text>
  <text start="869.23" dur="3.9">Afghanistan which they&amp;#39;ve been working</text>
  <text start="870.459" dur="5.431">already and they&amp;#39;re saying that they</text>
  <text start="873.13" dur="8.34">would like to bring the or over to Iran</text>
  <text start="875.89" dur="7.59">to basically to process it but</text>
  <text start="881.47" dur="4.32">Afghanistan is saying no no we want all</text>
  <text start="883.48" dur="4.68">processing done here in Afghanistan and</text>
  <text start="885.79" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re trying to work out a deal now</text>
  <text start="888.16" dur="4.34">the United States Geological Survey</text>
  <text start="889.66" dur="6.15">study has estimated that Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="892.5" dur="5.92">deposits are worth over one trillion</text>
  <text start="895.81" dur="4.17">dollars and what do they have well they</text>
  <text start="898.42" dur="4.169">have gold they have silver their</text>
  <text start="899.98" dur="6.349">platinum they have iron and they are</text>
  <text start="902.589" dur="7.861">being held as the Saudi Arabia of</text>
  <text start="906.329" dur="6.341">lithium and lithium is used to make</text>
  <text start="910.45" dur="4.68">batteries for your phone&amp;#39;s electric cars</text>
  <text start="912.67" dur="4.56">and everything else so we see right now</text>
  <text start="915.13" dur="3.54">they have a lot of natural resources and</text>
  <text start="917.23" dur="3.99">we know that China&amp;#39;s already in there</text>
  <text start="918.67" dur="5.039">Russia is already making deals and at</text>
  <text start="921.22" dur="4.679">this point we understand why the deep</text>
  <text start="923.709" dur="4.021">state was in Afghanistan to basically</text>
  <text start="925.899" dur="4.921">control this area so Street took look</text>
  <text start="927.73" dur="4.979">it&amp;#39;s a strategic location they have the</text>
  <text start="930.82" dur="4.65">poppy field they can run their missions</text>
  <text start="932.709" dur="5.761">out of this area but it&amp;#39;s all being</text>
  <text start="935.47" dur="4.77">scrapped right now the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="938.47" dur="4.2">being beaten and hunted down in</text>
  <text start="940.24" dur="4.38">Afghanistan the poppy fields are closing</text>
  <text start="942.67" dur="3.99">down they&amp;#39;re going after those</text>
  <text start="944.62" dur="4.459">individuals that have been controlling</text>
  <text start="946.66" dur="6.929">the fields and everything is being</text>
  <text start="949.079" dur="6.851">basically removed and shut down in this</text>
  <text start="953.589" dur="5.011">area just like it wasn&amp;#39;t Syria just like</text>
  <text start="955.93" dur="5.25">it wasn&amp;#39;t Iraq and pretty soon you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="958.6" dur="5.31">gonna see that there&amp;#39;s no reason to have</text>
  <text start="961.18" dur="3.3">soldiers in afghanistan now kim</text>
  <text start="963.91" dur="2.97">jeong-hoon</text>
  <text start="964.48" dur="5.039">it&amp;#39;s being reported that he&amp;#39;s making</text>
  <text start="966.88" dur="5.519">this unexpected trip to Beijing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="969.519" dur="4.201">taking this armored train and they have</text>
  <text start="972.399" dur="2.25">a picture of it and I don&amp;#39;t believe he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="973.72" dur="3.299">on this train because that may be</text>
  <text start="974.649" dur="5.461">absolutely ridiculous because that would</text>
  <text start="977.019" dur="5.521">give the deep state the ability to maybe</text>
  <text start="980.11" dur="4.5">hit it with some type of missile or have</text>
  <text start="982.54" dur="3.479">the tracks blow up I think this is a</text>
  <text start="984.61" dur="3">diversion</text>
  <text start="986.019" dur="5.31">and people think that he is on this</text>
  <text start="987.61" dur="6">armored train and most likely he&amp;#39;s using</text>
  <text start="991.329" dur="3.841">a different way to get to China for this</text>
  <text start="993.61" dur="4.169">meeting and I think this is all part of</text>
  <text start="995.17" dur="5.039">the peace talks and we already know that</text>
  <text start="997.779" dur="4.261">they had peace negotiations in Finland</text>
  <text start="1000.209" dur="4.17">and things went really really well and</text>
  <text start="1002.04" dur="6.089">we can see that we&amp;#39;re getting closer and</text>
  <text start="1004.379" dur="8.7">closer to this point now Q has made some</text>
  <text start="1008.129" dur="7.38">very interesting posts and we can see</text>
  <text start="1013.079" dur="6.18">right now Q has said that the clock is</text>
  <text start="1015.509" dur="7.32">activated red castle green castle meet</text>

  <text start="1022.829" dur="7.83">wall is a go and Q also said clock</text>
  <text start="1027.029" dur="7.8">activated stage five by five</text>
  <text start="1030.659" dur="7.29">yes now what it looks like to me is that</text>
  <text start="1034.829" dur="7.681">the stage is set the clock is activated</text>
  <text start="1037.949" dur="7.561">for the Hillary Clinton video to be</text>
  <text start="1042.51" dur="6.029">dropped and everything is going to be</text>
  <text start="1045.51" dur="8.039">put into motion I&amp;#39;m thinking very very</text>
  <text start="1048.539" dur="6.75">soon and if Q lives up to what this</text>
