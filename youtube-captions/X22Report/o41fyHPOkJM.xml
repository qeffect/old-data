  <text start="69.95" dur="3.39">bank countries and they want to be</text>
  <text start="72.05" dur="2.7">completely independent because they</text>
  <text start="73.34" dur="4.85">realize eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>

  <text start="84.619" dur="3.931">a war and they realize they need to be</text>
  <text start="86.75" dur="4.14">separate and apart from what is coming</text>
  <text start="88.55" dur="5.129">right now what Russia is doing is that</text>
  <text start="90.89" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re paying down a massive 52.8</text>
  <text start="93.679" dur="5.131">billion in foreign debt as putting d</text>

  <text start="98.81" dur="6.21">reducing external debt to the lowest</text>
  <text start="101.06" dur="7.05">since 2012 and we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="105.02" dur="7.98">ongoing and they realize what is coming</text>
  <text start="108.11" dur="7.53">now with Ebola we see that the West</text>
  <text start="113" dur="5.34">African countries are looking for more</text>
  <text start="115.64" dur="4.649">aid we have the United States and UK</text>
  <text start="118.34" dur="4.619">bringing in military soldiers Sierra</text>
  <text start="120.289" dur="5.25">Leone is calling out for Russian help</text>
  <text start="122.959" dur="4.561">with the virus and we see it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="125.539" dur="5.641">much contained in those countries and</text>
  <text start="127.52" dur="6.45">now Uganda is infected with a ebola-like</text>
  <text start="131.18" dur="4.47">type of hemorrhagic type of fever in</text>
  <text start="133.97" dur="4.44">that area and all these countries have</text>
  <text start="135.65" dur="4.78">had recent oil and natural gas</text>
  <text start="138.41" dur="4.15">discoveries we understand that China</text>
  <text start="140.43" dur="3.69">Russia are both pumping in billions of</text>
  <text start="142.56" dur="4.649">dollars into the infrastructure into</text>
  <text start="144.12" dur="5.25">these countries and now we see Ebola</text>
  <text start="147.209" dur="4.771">inside the United States where we had</text>
  <text start="149.37" dur="4.86">dumped Thomas Edward Duncan who was</text>
  <text start="151.98" dur="4.83">infected who came from West Africa who</text>
  <text start="154.23" dur="4.95">died here in the United States and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="156.81" dur="4.97">seeing a lot of the vaccine companies</text>
  <text start="159.18" dur="5.49">the drug companies like zmapp and</text>
  <text start="161.78" dur="5.049">GlaxoSmithKline really accelerating</text>
  <text start="164.67" dur="4.5">their programs for vaccines usually a</text>
  <text start="166.829" dur="6.121">vaccine takes anywhere from 10 to 30</text>
  <text start="169.17" dur="6.719">years to really create and test and make</text>
  <text start="172.95" dur="5.25">sure it&amp;#39;s safe and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="175.889" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re trying to move this as hard and</text>
  <text start="178.2" dur="4.02">fast as they possibly can with pretty</text>
  <text start="180.359" dur="3.901">much no testing at all what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="182.22" dur="4.129">testing consists of the people that are</text>
  <text start="184.26" dur="5.789">already sick and they give the vaccine</text>
  <text start="186.349" dur="5.5">some people live some people die and</text>
  <text start="190.049" dur="4.55">that&amp;#39;s like a 50-50 chance but you have</text>
  <text start="191.849" dur="5.25">to remember this strain of Ebola is</text>
  <text start="194.599" dur="4.78">fifty-six percent will die forty-four</text>
  <text start="197.099" dur="5.97">percent will live and if your immune</text>
  <text start="199.379" dur="7.83">system is strong and you you keep it up</text>
  <text start="203.069" dur="6.75">to date and taking the eating foods that</text>
  <text start="207.209" dur="5.551">boost your immune system like ginger or</text>
  <text start="209.819" dur="5.31">taking zinc or things like that you have</text>
  <text start="212.76" dur="5.159">a better chance of surviving Ebola and</text>
  <text start="215.129" dur="5.01">what we&amp;#39;re seeing and what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="217.919" dur="3.57">talking about in the last couple days</text>
  <text start="220.139" dur="4.59">and a lot of places been talking about</text>
  <text start="221.489" dur="5.61">this is about vaccines becoming</text>
  <text start="224.729" dur="5.22">mandatory and I see on a common sense</text>
  <text start="227.099" dur="6.331">show dave hodges was discussing this</text>
  <text start="229.949" dur="5.271">about mandatory vaccines and he brought</text>
  <text start="233.43" dur="7.11">up some very interesting points where</text>
  <text start="235.22" dur="7.689">eventually these companies are going to</text>
  <text start="240.54" dur="5.729">most likely make it mandatory they made</text>
  <text start="242.909" dur="6.42">other vaccines mandatory and we see it</text>
  <text start="246.269" dur="4.44">as children go to school to get into the</text>
  <text start="249.329" dur="3.66">school you have to be vaccinated of</text>
  <text start="250.709" dur="3.75">course if you have religious beliefs and</text>
  <text start="252.989" dur="3.42">things like that you do not have to get</text>
  <text start="254.459" dur="3.93">vaccinated but they&amp;#39;ve made it mandatory</text>
  <text start="256.409" dur="4.26">for pretty much everyone and way they</text>
  <text start="258.389" dur="7.171">might even take this a step full-forward</text>
  <text start="260.669" dur="7.8">where they might implement a vaccine ID</text>
  <text start="265.56" dur="5.4">card to make sure that you are up to</text>
  <text start="268.469" dur="5.07">date in your vaccines and it looks like</text>
  <text start="270.96" dur="3.09">DHS is lobbying to have this information</text>
  <text start="273.539" dur="2.28">to be</text>
  <text start="274.05" dur="4.32">included on one&amp;#39;s driver&amp;#39;s license and</text>
  <text start="275.819" dur="4.861">it will be a prerequisite to obtain a</text>
  <text start="278.37" dur="3.96">driver&amp;#39;s license emittance to movie</text>
  <text start="280.68" dur="4.13">theater sporting events or any other</text>
  <text start="282.33" dur="4.799">public place you might have to show a</text>
  <text start="284.81" dur="5.68">vaccine card to show that you were</text>
  <text start="287.129" dur="8.88">vaccinated and we can see even to get a</text>
  <text start="290.49" dur="9.329">job this might also be a produce this to</text>
  <text start="296.009" dur="6.481">get a job of employment so we can see</text>
  <text start="299.819" dur="4.261">what their mission is and from</text>
  <text start="302.49" dur="5.07">everything that they&amp;#39;ve been doing right</text>
  <text start="304.08" dur="6.929">now we can see the fear factor is much</text>
  <text start="307.56" dur="6.199">larger than the spreading of Ebola and</text>
  <text start="311.009" dur="6.421">we can see already Connecticut is taking</text>
  <text start="313.759" dur="6.851">precautions and they implemented a quazy</text>
  <text start="317.43" dur="6.359">martial law type of legislation and</text>
  <text start="320.61" dur="4.98">there is no cases in Connecticut at this</text>
  <text start="323.789" dur="3.901">time and they&amp;#39;re continually pushing us</text>
  <text start="325.59" dur="5.37">and we might see this go from state to</text>
  <text start="327.69" dur="4.469">state to state and eventually the US</text>
  <text start="330.96" dur="3.509">government will come out there and</text>
  <text start="332.159" dur="3.841">they&amp;#39;ll say okay let&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="334.469" dur="3.241">have to declare medical martial law</text>
  <text start="336" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;re going to have to set up in each</text>
  <text start="337.71" dur="4.5">one of these schools a facility where</text>
  <text start="340.59" dur="3.24">everyone gets injected we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="342.21" dur="3.9">have to make it mandatory for every</text>
  <text start="343.83" dur="4.5">single person and again we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="346.11" dur="4.649">what&amp;#39;s in these vaccines we don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="348.33" dur="4.709">know if they work their experimental</text>
  <text start="350.759" dur="4.201">they don&amp;#39;t even work on the people</text>
  <text start="353.039" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s out there and I would be very</text>
  <text start="354.96" dur="7.47">very hesitant in trying to get one of</text>
  <text start="357.599" dur="6.12">these vaccines okay now in Nigeria we</text>
  <text start="362.43" dur="3.329">understand the United States government</text>
  <text start="363.719" dur="4.41">central bankers have been trying to get</text>
  <text start="365.759" dur="3.96">into this country they tried with Boko</text>
  <text start="368.129" dur="4.111">Haram saying that this organization</text>
  <text start="369.719" dur="4.531">kidnapped a hundred girls then it was a</text>
  <text start="372.24" dur="3.539">hundred boys and then I girion</text>
  <text start="374.25" dur="4.319">government came out and said listen we</text>
  <text start="375.779" dur="5.64">killed the leader he was an imposter the</text>
  <text start="378.569" dur="5.07">real one died in 2009 and we can see</text>
  <text start="381.419" dur="3.96">that you&amp;#39;re continually placing a new</text>
  <text start="383.639" dur="2.671">one in its place and they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="385.379" dur="3.481">about the United States government</text>
  <text start="386.31" dur="4.65">central bankers and you can see the</text>
  <text start="388.86" dur="4.29">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="390.96" dur="3.929">have been trying to use terrorism inside</text>
  <text start="393.15" dur="4.199">Nigeria to get in there they even placed</text>
  <text start="394.889" dur="5.041">military soldiers in chat which borders</text>
  <text start="397.349" dur="3.961">up against Nigeria because they thought</text>
  <text start="399.93" dur="3.39">the Nigerian government we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="401.31" dur="3.539">ask the United States government to come</text>

  <text start="673.08" dur="5.67">they are definitely hiding something</text>
  <text start="675.27" dur="5.76">regards this mh17 flight being shot down</text>
  <text start="678.75" dur="4.2">and we pretty much know what it is we</text>
  <text start="681.03" dur="5.16">understand that Kiev was most likely</text>
  <text start="682.95" dur="6.03">responsible with the help of the United</text>
  <text start="686.19" dur="5.4">States government now it seems like</text>
  <text start="688.98" dur="6.06">they&amp;#39;re still pushing the agenda to</text>
  <text start="691.59" dur="5.25">demonize Russia at this time in the</text>
  <text start="695.04" dur="5.34">corporate media they&amp;#39;re saying Russia is</text>
  <text start="696.84" dur="5.97">now moving tactical nuclear weapons into</text>
  <text start="700.38" dur="4.2">Crimea congressman urged the President</text>
  <text start="702.81" dur="3.84">to brief Congress on the threatening</text>
  <text start="704.58" dur="3.93">Russian nuclear deployment in Crimea</text>
  <text start="706.65" dur="4.26">there are also called on the President</text>
  <text start="708.51" dur="4.44">to suspend the NATO Russian accord and</text>
  <text start="710.91" dur="4.07">demand the removal of all Russian</text>
  <text start="712.95" dur="3.9">military personnel from NATO facilities</text>
  <text start="714.98" dur="4.15">additionally they asked the United</text>

  <text start="719.13" dur="3.63">control surveillance flights by Russia</text>
  <text start="721.08" dur="4.68">carried out under the Open Skies treaty</text>
  <text start="722.76" dur="5.61">so basically what they&amp;#39;re doing is they</text>
  <text start="725.76" dur="4.47">are preparing for war they&amp;#39;re removing</text>
  <text start="728.37" dur="4.32">all the treaties they&amp;#39;re removing the</text>
  <text start="730.23" dur="4.68">open sky treaty and they&amp;#39;re demonizing</text>
  <text start="732.69" dur="5.52">demonizing Russia now the first thing we</text>
  <text start="734.91" dur="5.1">have to ask where is the proof they have</text>
  <text start="738.21" dur="3.87">none whatsoever they&amp;#39;re just out there</text>
  <text start="740.01" dur="6.39">telling everyone that this is what they</text>
  <text start="742.08" dur="7.11">believe second why would potent do this</text>
  <text start="746.4" dur="6.24">at this point in the game how would this</text>
  <text start="749.19" dur="7.62">benefit him he already has Crimea it</text>
  <text start="752.64" dur="6.75">makes no sense he already had the peace</text>
  <text start="756.81" dur="6.54">agreement the ceasefire agreement with</text>
  <text start="759.39" dur="6.09">the South Eastern people and the</text>
  <text start="763.35" dur="4.74">Ukrainian government right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="765.48" dur="6.24">under a ceasefire why would he put</text>
  <text start="768.09" dur="6.12">nuclear weapons inside of Crimea at this</text>
  <text start="771.72" dur="4.62">time it makes absolutely no sense it</text>
  <text start="774.21" dur="5.07">would not benefit him in any way</text>
  <text start="776.34" dur="5.43">whatsoever and of course this is a ploy</text>
  <text start="779.28" dur="5.07">to get rid of all the treaties to</text>
  <text start="781.77" dur="4.29">continually demonize Russia and this is</text>
  <text start="784.35" dur="4.74">exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing because they</text>
  <text start="786.06" dur="5.67">realize war is on its way and they are</text>
  <text start="789.09" dur="5.13">getting prepared for it now John Kerry</text>
  <text start="791.73" dur="4.98">is out there and he is saying that the</text>
  <text start="794.22" dur="4.35">u.s. stands alongside Lebanon and the</text>
  <text start="796.71" dur="4.65">fight with the Islamic state because as</text>
  <text start="798.57" dur="4.17">we know wherever the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="801.36" dur="2.64">that&amp;#39;s where the United States</text>
  <text start="802.74" dur="4.47">government&amp;#39;s going to go and we</text>

  <text start="807.21" dur="4.2">in Lebanon</text>
  <text start="808.889" dur="4.26">and we realize that the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="811.41" dur="3.929">going to be spreading to all those</text>
  <text start="813.149" dur="4.56">countries the United States needs to get</text>
  <text start="815.339" dur="4.92">into and we&amp;#39;ve already seen video</text>
  <text start="817.709" dur="5.011">footage of the Islamic state in Libya</text>
  <text start="820.259" dur="4.56">them riding around and we also realize</text>
  <text start="822.72" dur="5.099">now they&amp;#39;ve been reporting that the</text>
  <text start="824.819" dur="6.51">Islamic state has sent set up a a</text>
  <text start="827.819" dur="7.62">recruitment center inside of Libya now</text>
  <text start="831.329" dur="6.75">in Yemen what we are seeing is that the</text>
  <text start="835.439" dur="4.44">tribes in Yemen have seized the office</text>
  <text start="838.079" dur="4.711">of local administration in central</text>

  <text start="846.899" dur="3.87">tribes who are rising up who want their</text>
  <text start="848.639" dur="4.32">country back and they&amp;#39;re making more and</text>
  <text start="850.769" dur="4.98">more gains in Yemen so Libya and Yemen</text>
  <text start="852.959" dur="4.56">are posing a huge huge problem for the</text>
  <text start="855.749" dur="3.481">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="857.519" dur="3.87">and eventually what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="859.23" dur="4.589">is they&amp;#39;re going to say Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="861.389" dur="5.25">all in these countries and we need to go</text>
  <text start="863.819" dur="4.95">after them and there was an article</text>
  <text start="866.639" dur="5.31">saying that the Islamic state is now on</text>
  <text start="868.769" dur="4.86">the move in Libya and of course this is</text>
  <text start="871.949" dur="3.211">exactly what they want everyone to</text>
  <text start="873.629" dur="3.601">believe because wherever the Islamic</text>

  <text start="877.23" dur="4.56">going and again if you notice the</text>
  <text start="879.929" dur="4.32">Islamic state is only going to those</text>
  <text start="881.79" dur="6.089">places where the US government central</text>

  <text start="971.339" dur="3.301">and it will be blamed on the US</text>
  <text start="973.11" dur="3.95">government and central bankers and they</text>
  <text start="974.64" dur="4.68">don&amp;#39;t want this to happen so either they</text>
  <text start="977.06" dur="5.56">take all of these countries or they</text>
  <text start="979.32" dur="8.22">create some type of an event to cover it</text>

  <text start="1037.699" dur="6.23">rid of Assad Russia is on the other side</text>
  <text start="1040.48" dur="6.88">now erik prince who is the founder of</text>
  <text start="1043.929" dur="6.401">Blackwater is out there saying that the</text>
  <text start="1047.36" dur="5.61">Pentagon should hire a mercenary core</text>
  <text start="1050.33" dur="4.77">group to fight the Islamic state and</text>
  <text start="1052.97" dur="3.84">maybe they should hire his I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1055.1" dur="4.079">called the frontier services group now</text>
  <text start="1056.81" dur="4.68">they have so many different names and we</text>
  <text start="1059.179" dur="5.671">can see that he would like the United</text>
  <text start="1061.49" dur="5.01">States to go and use paid mercenaries to</text>
  <text start="1064.85" dur="4.74">fight along the other paid mercenaries</text>
  <text start="1066.5" dur="5.81">that they&amp;#39;re already paying for and to</text>
  <text start="1069.59" dur="5.01">go in and fight Assad and you can see</text>
  <text start="1072.31" dur="3.88">Obama would have kept his promise there</text>
  <text start="1074.6" dur="3">is no boots on the ground there</text>
  <text start="1076.19" dur="4.77">Americans there it&amp;#39;s paid mercenaries</text>
  <text start="1077.6" dur="6.179">and this is again you know a play on</text>
  <text start="1080.96" dur="4.86">words because eventually it still boots</text>
  <text start="1083.779" dur="3.87">on the ground and the United States is</text>
  <text start="1085.82" dur="4.26">still involved in this they&amp;#39;re giving</text>
  <text start="1087.649" dur="4.791">huge sums of money weapons and</text>
  <text start="1090.08" dur="4.709">everything else to these armed forces</text>
  <text start="1092.44" dur="4.599">but it seems like what they want this</text>
  <text start="1094.789" dur="4.86">how do they want this to work is they</text>
  <text start="1097.039" dur="7.02">want Congress to vote on this and pay</text>
  <text start="1099.649" dur="6.451">out of the Congress&amp;#39;s funds to support</text>
  <text start="1104.059" dur="4.74">this type of thing instead of using</text>
  <text start="1106.1" dur="4.65">covert money from you know the opium</text>
  <text start="1108.799" dur="4.35">fields the poppy fields that they sell</text>
  <text start="1110.75" dur="4.649">opium across the country and other drugs</text>

  <text start="1115.399" dur="3.931">been stealing from Syria so you can see</text>
  <text start="1117.409" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re really pushing this very hard</text>
  <text start="1119.33" dur="3.719">because they realize eventually they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1121.759" dur="3.481">going to have to put boots on the ground</text>
  <text start="1123.049" dur="4.26">one way or another they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="1125.24" dur="4.2">to do this and they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="1127.309" dur="4.381">make a case of why they&amp;#39;re going after</text>
  <text start="1129.44" dur="4.02">Assad and they&amp;#39;ve been trying many</text>
