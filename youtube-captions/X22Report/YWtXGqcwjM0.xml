  <text start="52.09" dur="5.75">hi and welcome you listening to the x-22</text>
  <text start="55.42" dur="6.42">report my name is Dave missus episode</text>
  <text start="57.84" dur="6.13">1278 B and today&amp;#39;s date is May 12 2017</text>
  <text start="61.84" dur="3.99">and the top of the episode is the deep</text>
  <text start="63.97" dur="4.399">States government dark secrets will</text>
  <text start="65.83" dur="5.34">destroy the fabric of the United States</text>
  <text start="68.369" dur="6.431">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="71.17" dur="5.94">political and geopolitical news now we</text>
  <text start="74.8" dur="3.75">can see that the corporate media which</text>
  <text start="77.11" dur="5.82">is the mouthpiece for the deep state</text>
  <text start="78.55" dur="6.09">they are out there and they have no idea</text>
  <text start="82.93" dur="4.2">what&amp;#39;s going on now everyone thinks that</text>
  <text start="84.64" dur="4.56">Trump is absolutely nuts and crazy but</text>
  <text start="87.13" dur="6.239">this is all part of the strategy this is</text>
  <text start="89.2" dur="6.33">all part of the chaotic period of time</text>
  <text start="93.369" dur="3.481">that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="95.53" dur="3.449">going to keep throwing things at them</text>
  <text start="96.85" dur="4.11">and they&amp;#39;re not going to know which way</text>
  <text start="98.979" dur="4.381">is up I mean the things are reporting on</text>
  <text start="100.96" dur="3.9">are absolutely ridiculous who said what</text>
  <text start="103.36" dur="3.42">how did he get fired why did he get</text>
  <text start="104.86" dur="4.8">fired doesn&amp;#39;t matter he&amp;#39;s fired</text>
  <text start="106.78" dur="3.42">I mean get it through your heads he is</text>
  <text start="109.66" dur="3.36">fired</text>
  <text start="110.2" dur="4.5">doesn&amp;#39;t matter how it all came down who</text>
  <text start="113.02" dur="4.14">said what it really makes no difference</text>
  <text start="114.7" dur="5.339">that&amp;#39;s not really news I mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="117.16" dur="5.19">missing the important stuff but he wants</text>
  <text start="120.039" dur="4.17">it this way he wants them to keep busy</text>
  <text start="122.35" dur="4.95">on all this stuff he had his lawyer out</text>
  <text start="124.209" dur="5.19">there and he had his lawyer write a</text>
  <text start="127.3" dur="5.519">letter saying that I looked at the tax</text>
  <text start="129.399" dur="6.691">returns there&amp;#39;s no income from Russia</text>
  <text start="132.819" dur="7.471">but there are exceptions he did that on</text>
  <text start="136.09" dur="6.84">purpose to keep the corporate media busy</text>
  <text start="140.29" dur="6.419">to keep them guessing he wants them</text>
  <text start="142.93" dur="6.93">doing this while he works on everything</text>
  <text start="146.709" dur="5.581">else they have no idea what is going on</text>
  <text start="149.86" dur="3.84">right now because if they did they&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="152.29" dur="2.91">reporting on it we know that the</text>
  <text start="153.7" dur="5.369">corporate media they do no investigation</text>
  <text start="155.2" dur="9.539">whatsoever we see that the whole Russian</text>
  <text start="159.069" dur="7.981">collusion thing is fake as we know but</text>
  <text start="164.739" dur="5.631">something very important about it that</text>
  <text start="167.05" dur="7.2">no one is really bringing up the FBI</text>
  <text start="170.37" dur="8.589">Russia gate probe is a counter espionage</text>
  <text start="174.25" dur="10.45">not a criminal probe remember there is</text>
  <text start="178.959" dur="8.471">no alleged or suspected type of</text>
  <text start="184.7" dur="6.39">crime on the part of any US citizen</text>
  <text start="187.43" dur="7.08">there is no FBI probe of the Trump</text>
  <text start="191.09" dur="7.74">campaign there is an FBI probe of the</text>
  <text start="194.51" dur="7.229">alleged role of Russia and how they</text>
  <text start="198.83" dur="5.519">might have done something with the u.s.</text>
  <text start="201.739" dur="5.431">elections so this is not a criminal</text>
  <text start="204.349" dur="4.531">probe carried out by the FBI as law</text>
  <text start="207.17" dur="4.5">enforcement agency but is a counter</text>
  <text start="208.88" dur="5.01">espionage probe carried out by the FBI</text>
  <text start="211.67" dur="6.66">in its capacity as a Counter</text>
  <text start="213.89" dur="7.77">Intelligence Agency so we can see right</text>
  <text start="218.33" dur="6.96">now they keep saying oh we fired the FBI</text>
  <text start="221.66" dur="7.62">well there was no criminal probe against</text>
  <text start="225.29" dur="6.99">Trump so what they keep talking about is</text>
  <text start="229.28" dur="4.92">their melding the two into one just like</text>
  <text start="232.28" dur="3.239">they talked about immigrants and illegal</text>
  <text start="234.2" dur="5.46">immigrants and they just call them</text>
  <text start="235.519" dur="6">immigrants which is completely wrong now</text>
  <text start="239.66" dur="5.79">Trump is out there saying listen call me</text>
  <text start="241.519" dur="7.161">do not leak anything because you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="245.45" dur="6.509">know if I have recordings of our</text>
  <text start="248.68" dur="6.309">discussions now he didn&amp;#39;t say of our</text>
  <text start="251.959" dur="6.571">Russian collusion discussions he just</text>
  <text start="254.989" dur="6.75">said of our discussions which means he</text>
  <text start="258.53" dur="6.75">has something on Comey actually Trump</text>
  <text start="261.739" dur="7.05">has all the dark secrets of the deep</text>
  <text start="265.28" dur="7.83">State he can pull out anything at any</text>
  <text start="268.789" dur="7.081">time and destroy them now people say</text>
  <text start="273.11" dur="4.71">that&amp;#39;s crazy you would never have that</text>
  <text start="275.87" dur="4.47">and even if he did he would use it right</text>
  <text start="277.82" dur="4.86">now and just do it no because the deep</text>
  <text start="280.34" dur="4.65">dark secrets of our government that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="282.68" dur="6.57">been going on for a very long time would</text>
  <text start="284.99" dur="7.14">rip apart the entire United States the</text>
  <text start="289.25" dur="6.03">fabric of the United States what would</text>
  <text start="292.13" dur="4.77">that do to the country well people would</text>
  <text start="295.28" dur="3.359">lose faith in the government and people</text>
  <text start="296.9" dur="3.12">said well let that happen let people</text>
  <text start="298.639" dur="5.311">lose faith let them see what the</text>
  <text start="300.02" dur="7.11">government is all about if he did do</text>
  <text start="303.95" dur="6.39">this it would be so difficult and it</text>
  <text start="307.13" dur="6.45">would take many many years for any type</text>
  <text start="310.34" dur="5.88">of governmental leader to fill the</text>
  <text start="313.58" dur="5.1">position and carry out what needs to be</text>
  <text start="316.22" dur="4.35">done there needs to be some type</text>
  <text start="318.68" dur="4.23">leader especially leader that works for</text>
  <text start="320.57" dur="4.86">the people and I know you&amp;#39;re like well</text>
  <text start="322.91" dur="5.069">he should let all this out and let the</text>
  <text start="325.43" dur="4.68">pieces fall where they may well we have</text>
  <text start="327.979" dur="5.761">to remember what is happening here all</text>
  <text start="330.11" dur="6.929">at the same time we have a collapse of</text>
  <text start="333.74" dur="5.97">the system if he lets out all the deep</text>
  <text start="337.039" dur="5.281">dark secrets well we have a collapse of</text>
  <text start="339.71" dur="5.07">the entire government and people will</text>
  <text start="342.32" dur="6.09">not trust the government ever ever again</text>
  <text start="344.78" dur="5.729">and we&amp;#39;re going to need a government for</text>
  <text start="348.41" dur="3.36">We the People not a government for the</text>
  <text start="350.509" dur="3.931">banks not a government for the</text>
  <text start="351.77" dur="4.739">corporations yes will this all happen</text>
  <text start="354.44" dur="4.08">once again yeah the founding fathers</text>
  <text start="356.509" dur="4.44">weren&amp;#39;t warned us of all this that</text>
  <text start="358.52" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;ve given us freedom temporarily and</text>
  <text start="360.949" dur="4.081">once again you&amp;#39;re going to have to fight</text>
  <text start="362.75" dur="5.16">for your freedom because they knew the</text>
  <text start="365.03" dur="5.79">government would become corrupt it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="367.91" dur="5.37">just inevitable but when the system</text>
  <text start="370.82" dur="4.409">starts all over the government will be</text>
  <text start="373.28" dur="3.54">working for it we the people if he</text>
  <text start="375.229" dur="3.78">destroys the government now with all</text>
  <text start="376.82" dur="4.05">these deep dark secrets like all the</text>
  <text start="379.009" dur="5.371">pedophile rings and all these different</text>
  <text start="380.87" dur="7.35">things it will destroy the fabric of the</text>
  <text start="384.38" dur="6.9">United States now he can use all of this</text>
  <text start="388.22" dur="6.03">as leverage and that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="391.28" dur="5.22">to do later on he&amp;#39;s going to bring it</text>
  <text start="394.25" dur="4.71">out for certain individuals that need to</text>
  <text start="396.5" dur="4.62">be removed maybe not put it out in</text>
  <text start="398.96" dur="4.949">public but mention it and all of a</text>
  <text start="401.12" dur="5.28">sudden these people are resigning or</text>
  <text start="403.909" dur="3.6">he&amp;#39;ll just go out and fire them and they</text>
  <text start="406.4" dur="2.25">will not be able to say anything</text>
  <text start="407.509" dur="4.201">afterwards</text>
  <text start="408.65" dur="6.32">now WikiLeaks they want the recordings</text>
  <text start="411.71" dur="6.019">of the Trump Comey</text>
  <text start="414.97" dur="7.12">conversation and they&amp;#39;re offering</text>
  <text start="417.729" dur="7.03">$100,000 to get those recordings will</text>
  <text start="422.09" dur="5.819">they get it who knows but they put up</text>
  <text start="424.759" dur="5.011">their whole entire Bitcoin thing where</text>
  <text start="427.909" dur="5.491">they&amp;#39;re saying hey listen you have them</text>
  <text start="429.77" dur="6.36">we&amp;#39;ll pay you so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="433.4" dur="4.17">now is that chaos is going to be</text>
  <text start="436.13" dur="3.029">continuing it&amp;#39;s going to accelerate</text>
  <text start="437.57" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;re going to see things get even</text>
  <text start="439.159" dur="6.901">crazier as time goes on and this is</text>
  <text start="442.97" dur="4.8">being done on purpose they he wants all</text>
  <text start="446.06" dur="4.2">of this to happen</text>
  <text start="447.77" dur="4.709">in this way to keep the corporate media</text>
  <text start="450.26" dur="5.209">so busy with nonsense</text>
  <text start="452.479" dur="5.821">that they don&amp;#39;t realize what is going on</text>
  <text start="455.469" dur="4.961">now the Office of the Director of</text>
  <text start="458.3" dur="4.44">National Intelligence they really</text>
  <text start="460.43" dur="4.259">released a report last year showing you</text>
  <text start="462.74" dur="4.769">how many times federal officials</text>
  <text start="464.689" dur="4.56">requested the unmasking of the names of</text>
  <text start="467.509" dur="5.37">Americans captured in the NSA</text>
  <text start="469.249" dur="6.5">surveillance for 2015 the odni reported</text>
  <text start="472.879" dur="7.831">that 654 Americans had their names</text>
  <text start="475.749" dur="7.45">unmasked in NSA surveillance and when we</text>
  <text start="480.71" dur="4.62">look at the report and we break it down</text>
  <text start="483.199" dur="5.071">the actual number really is two thousand</text>
  <text start="485.33" dur="5.88">two hundred and thirty-two people now</text>
  <text start="488.27" dur="4.29">theoretically the masking process is</text>
  <text start="491.21" dur="4.5">supposed to protect the rights and</text>
  <text start="492.56" dur="6.27">identities of Americans in practice it</text>
  <text start="495.71" dur="5.19">does little more than add a small speed</text>
  <text start="498.83" dur="5.699">bump on the road to the surveillance</text>
  <text start="500.9" dur="7.499">state beginning in 2011 Obama well he</text>
  <text start="504.529" dur="8.64">made it very easy for the spy agencies</text>
  <text start="508.399" dur="7.74">by executive order to spy on individuals</text>
  <text start="513.169" dur="7.05">and to unmask American citizens of</text>
  <text start="516.139" dur="6.09">course this was all to fight terrorism</text>
  <text start="520.219" dur="4.521">which we know this is not what it was</text>
  <text start="522.229" dur="5.121">all about this was about spying on</text>
  <text start="524.74" dur="6.849">government officials Americans</text>
  <text start="527.35" dur="6.489">corporations to use this information for</text>
  <text start="531.589" dur="4.68">blackmail purposes to understand what</text>
  <text start="533.839" dur="6.141">individuals are up to this had nothing</text>
  <text start="536.269" dur="7.32">to do with terrorism whatsoever in 2016</text>
  <text start="539.98" dur="7.089">the actual contents of NSA intercepted</text>
  <text start="543.589" dur="5.43">calls and emails reached five thousand</text>
  <text start="547.069" dur="5.07">two hundred and eighty-eight Americans</text>
  <text start="549.019" dur="7.111">an increase of 13% over the prior year</text>
  <text start="552.139" dur="9.771">and a massive spike from the 198 names</text>
  <text start="556.13" dur="11.069">searched in 2013 those 30,000 searches</text>
  <text start="561.91" dur="7.989">ultimately resulted in 3134 NSA</text>
  <text start="567.199" dur="4.801">intelligence reports with unredacted</text>
  <text start="569.899" dur="6.331">u.s. names being distributed across</text>
  <text start="572" dur="9.54">government in 2016 in 2015 the number of</text>
  <text start="576.23" dur="8.18">unmasked Americans was 3354 the report</text>
  <text start="581.54" dur="4.68">also says about half the time u.s.</text>
  <text start="584.41" dur="4.42">identities were under</text>
  <text start="586.22" dur="5.46">in the original reports while the other</text>
  <text start="588.83" dur="5.15">half were unmasked after the fact by</text>
  <text start="591.68" dur="5.61">special request of the obama</text>
  <text start="593.98" dur="7.3">administration officials so this was all</text>
  <text start="597.29" dur="6.42">being done to look at Americans not</text>
  <text start="601.28" dur="6.17">foreigners yes they looked at foreigners</text>
  <text start="603.71" dur="6.65">but mostly to look at certain Americans</text>
  <text start="607.45" dur="6.7">now WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="610.36" dur="7.3">tweeted out something that is going to</text>
  <text start="614.15" dur="8.28">pretty much destroy the narrative of the</text>
  <text start="617.66" dur="8.96">election in 2016 about how Russia was</text>
  <text start="622.43" dur="6.33">meddling in the election the news agency</text>
  <text start="626.62" dur="6.04">detailed the contents of the book</text>
  <text start="628.76" dur="6.06">shattered written by Jonathan Allen now</text>
  <text start="632.66" dur="3.78">WikiLeaks uploaded a picture from the</text>
  <text start="634.82" dur="5.55">page of Alan&amp;#39;s new book which destroys</text>
  <text start="636.44" dur="7.8">the Russian hacking narrative what do I</text>
  <text start="640.37" dur="9.12">mean by this well it shows that the</text>
  <text start="644.24" dur="9.57">blame Russian plan it was hatched within</text>
  <text start="649.49" dur="6.81">24 hours of the election loss the</text>
  <text start="653.81" dur="3.96">Clinton camp put out the notion to</text>
  <text start="656.3" dur="4.29">members of the media which is the</text>
  <text start="657.77" dur="4.62">mouthpiece of the deep state that there</text>
  <text start="660.59" dur="3.66">might have been some type of Russian</text>
  <text start="662.39" dur="5.34">hacking there might have been some type</text>
  <text start="664.25" dur="7.35">of Russian collusion and they got the</text>
  <text start="667.73" dur="8.01">ball rolling and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="671.6" dur="5.67">that they were using cyberattacks before</text>
  <text start="675.74" dur="3.62">the elections and we have to go back in</text>
  <text start="677.27" dur="5.3">time and remember what happened there</text>
  <text start="679.36" dur="6.37">remember Clinton won the popular vote</text>
  <text start="682.57" dur="4.81">that is the vote by the people now of</text>
  <text start="685.73" dur="4.109">course we know this was completely</text>
  <text start="687.38" dur="4.14">manipulated we know this was all done by</text>
  <text start="689.839" dur="4.231">the illegals that were coming into the</text>
  <text start="691.52" dur="4.62">country and this was part of the agenda</text>
  <text start="694.07" dur="6.39">to bring the illegals in to have them</text>
  <text start="696.14" dur="7.62">vote for certain candidates and we can</text>
  <text start="700.46" dur="6.36">see right now that she won the popular</text>
  <text start="703.76" dur="6.54">vote even though it was manipulated but</text>
  <text start="706.82" dur="6.09">Trump won the electoral college and the</text>
  <text start="710.3" dur="4.77">electoral college is completely separate</text>
  <text start="712.91" dur="3.48">and apart from the people voting the</text>
  <text start="715.07" dur="4.08">Electoral College doesn&amp;#39;t go to the</text>
  <text start="716.39" dur="3.66">electronic booths and vote and they come</text>
  <text start="719.15" dur="4.26">up with their vote they meet</text>
  <text start="720.05" dur="5.789">later on and they say okay let&amp;#39;s have a</text>
  <text start="723.41" dur="4.41">voting at that point in time and see if</text>
  <text start="725.839" dur="5.221">it stands the way we want it to be and</text>
  <text start="727.82" dur="5.01">in the beginning they said listen if</text>
  <text start="731.06" dur="3.87">Trump wins and he&amp;#39;s starting to win</text>
  <text start="732.83" dur="4.11">there could be some type of cyber attack</text>
  <text start="734.93" dur="3.899">this was all put into place to make</text>
  <text start="736.94" dur="4.139">everyone believe that if he&amp;#39;s winning</text>
  <text start="738.829" dur="4.26">that Russia was helping him win or</text>
  <text start="741.079" dur="4.171">something was being done to the election</text>
  <text start="743.089" dur="5.391">numbers but they couldn&amp;#39;t use that</text>
  <text start="745.25" dur="5.85">because Clinton won the popular vote</text>
  <text start="748.48" dur="4.78">they couldn&amp;#39;t explain it away how the</text>
  <text start="751.1" dur="5.07">cyber attack helped the Electoral</text>
  <text start="753.26" dur="5.759">College decide who they wanted as</text>
  <text start="756.17" dur="4.349">president that&amp;#39;s where it fell apart</text>
  <text start="759.019" dur="3.421">because they thought if they got the</text>
  <text start="760.519" dur="3.63">popular vote the Electoral College would</text>
  <text start="762.44" dur="3.48">just go along with that and they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="764.149" dur="4.351">and this is where the whole plan</text>
  <text start="765.92" dur="5.82">completely fell apart and they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="768.5" dur="7.14">use that entire plan at that point in</text>
  <text start="771.74" dur="7.14">time that Russia helped with the voting</text>
  <text start="775.64" dur="6.33">because that means that Russia really</text>
  <text start="778.88" dur="5.07">helped Clinton with the popular vote so</text>
  <text start="781.97" dur="4.53">then they had to make it into this whole</text>
  <text start="783.95" dur="3.15">Russian collusion thing and this is all</text>
  <text start="786.5" dur="2.88">they have</text>
  <text start="787.1" dur="5.31">they have really nothing else now</text>
  <text start="789.38" dur="5.31">Condoleezza Rice she&amp;#39;s out there and she</text>
  <text start="792.41" dur="6.33">said something very interesting that the</text>
  <text start="794.69" dur="5.7">u.s. went into Iraq and remember she was</text>
  <text start="798.74" dur="5.25">the national security adviser under</text>
  <text start="800.39" dur="7.11">george w bush she said the goal of the</text>
  <text start="803.99" dur="7.589">United States in the invasion of Iraq</text>
  <text start="807.5" dur="6.24">back in 2003 was to topple Saddam</text>
  <text start="811.579" dur="5.521">Hussein and it was not to bring</text>
  <text start="813.74" dur="5.969">democracy to the Middle East well she</text>
  <text start="817.1" dur="5.16">left off something very important it was</text>
  <text start="819.709" dur="6.12">to make sure that this country kept</text>
  <text start="822.26" dur="8.76">using the dollar on the oil and we went</text>
  <text start="825.829" dur="9.271">into Libya Yemen Sudan Somalia Lebanon</text>
  <text start="831.02" dur="6.66">and now in Syria eventually ending up in</text>
  <text start="835.1" dur="5.94">Iran because the central bankers wanted</text>
  <text start="837.68" dur="6.21">to capture all these countries that were</text>
  <text start="841.04" dur="4.95">able to ship out oil and the oil is</text>
  <text start="843.89" dur="4.83">going to be sold on the dollar now Libya</text>
  <text start="845.99" dur="5.339">Iraq they all wanted it and they started</text>
  <text start="848.72" dur="5.14">to sell the oil not using the dollar</text>
  <text start="851.329" dur="5.951">that&amp;#39;s where the problem came in because</text>
  <text start="853.86" dur="6.6">the dollar needs to be continually</text>
  <text start="857.28" dur="5.31">propped up with the sale of oil which</text>
  <text start="860.46" dur="7.65">allows countries to keep the dollar in</text>
  <text start="862.59" dur="7.47">reserve and if that chain is broken the</text>
  <text start="868.11" dur="4.23">entire system comes crumbling down</text>
  <text start="870.06" dur="6.93">actually their system comes crumbling</text>
  <text start="872.34" dur="8.28">down now we can see that South Korea</text>
  <text start="876.99" dur="6.42">they&amp;#39;re going to attend the China&amp;#39;s Silk</text>
  <text start="880.62" dur="6.99">Road summit the new president of South</text>
  <text start="883.41" dur="7.85">Korea was invited by Xi Jinping and we</text>
  <text start="887.61" dur="8.04">can see that North Korea is also invited</text>
  <text start="891.26" dur="5.98">to the same thing now again if we talk</text>
  <text start="895.65" dur="3.87">about what happened with the trade deal</text>
  <text start="897.24" dur="4.56">between China and the United States the</text>
  <text start="899.52" dur="5.85">United States is looking at the Silk</text>
  <text start="901.8" dur="7.05">Road the United States will eventually</text>
  <text start="905.37" dur="6.81">join the Silk Road the TPP is dead the</text>
  <text start="908.85" dur="6.18">TTIP dead that&amp;#39;s what the globalist</text>
  <text start="912.18" dur="5.73">wanted and we need to remember China</text>
  <text start="915.03" dur="4.89">Russia North Korea Philippines many</text>
  <text start="917.91" dur="3.96">other countries they are joining the</text>
  <text start="919.92" dur="4.38">Silk Road the United States is going to</text>
  <text start="921.87" dur="6.33">be joining the Silk Road when the system</text>
  <text start="924.3" dur="8.46">crashes we will not have trade like we</text>
  <text start="928.2" dur="6.87">have now because using the dollar as the</text>
  <text start="932.76" dur="5.16">reserve currency that&amp;#39;s going to come to</text>
  <text start="935.07" dur="6.39">an end so people are not going to give</text>
  <text start="937.92" dur="7.47">us their goods for dollars that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="941.46" dur="7.05">to completely end so we need to work</text>
  <text start="945.39" dur="5.04">with countries on trade now remember</text>
  <text start="948.51" dur="4.53">China and Russia</text>
  <text start="950.43" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;ve been accumulating gold for a</text>
  <text start="953.04" dur="4.11">long time now they already understand</text>
  <text start="955.32" dur="4.62">they already set up their entire system</text>
  <text start="957.15" dur="6.48">let&amp;#39;s go back in time to all the other</text>
  <text start="959.94" dur="6.96">reports the East right now has set up a</text>
  <text start="963.63" dur="6.12">payment system that is the same as the</text>
  <text start="966.9" dur="5.94">Swift they are working without the</text>
  <text start="969.75" dur="6.39">dollar they&amp;#39;re trading without the</text>
  <text start="972.84" dur="4.8">dollar they have their own gold exchange</text>
  <text start="976.14" dur="6.09">they actually have their own trading</text>
  <text start="977.64" dur="6.3">systems that mimic the West the reason</text>
  <text start="982.23" dur="3.36">for all of this is because when the</text>
  <text start="983.94" dur="6.03">system comes down</text>
  <text start="985.59" dur="7.76">everything will change and this is what</text>
  <text start="989.97" dur="6.15">is happening right now now North Korea</text>
  <text start="993.35" dur="5.71">their Parliament they are writing to the</text>
  <text start="996.12" dur="6">US Congress to protest the new sanctions</text>
  <text start="999.06" dur="5.13">and they&amp;#39;re asking to have a discussion</text>
  <text start="1002.12" dur="4.53">about what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="1004.19" dur="5.01">because right now the US sanctions they</text>
  <text start="1006.65" dur="4.83">ban ships owned or hired by North Korea</text>
  <text start="1009.2" dur="5.22">from operating in US waters or docking</text>
  <text start="1011.48" dur="4.41">at US ports and we can see that of</text>
  <text start="1014.42" dur="4.38">course this is going to hurt the country</text>
  <text start="1015.89" dur="6.48">and they&amp;#39;re looking to have a discussion</text>
  <text start="1018.8" dur="7.41">now the South Korean president moon</text>
  <text start="1022.37" dur="7.14">jae-in well he wants to limit US</text>
  <text start="1026.21" dur="5.22">sanctions on North Korea too and we can</text>
  <text start="1029.51" dur="3.3">see that moon jae-in wants to have a</text>
  <text start="1031.43" dur="6.45">discussion with the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="1032.81" dur="7.77">and talk about reducing the sanctions so</text>
  <text start="1037.88" dur="5.18">we can see right now that things are</text>
  <text start="1040.58" dur="5.58">changing there&amp;#39;s a discussion going on</text>
  <text start="1043.06" dur="7.09">China is working with North Korea this</text>
  <text start="1046.16" dur="7.86">is all part of the plan we see right now</text>
  <text start="1050.15" dur="7.02">that the safe zones in Syria which are</text>
  <text start="1054.02" dur="5.7">established by Syria and Russia they are</text>
  <text start="1057.17" dur="3.72">there to protect the civilians now of</text>
  <text start="1059.72" dur="3.12">course the corporate media here is</text>
  <text start="1060.89" dur="4.59">saying that these people are going to be</text>
  <text start="1062.84" dur="5.58">in trouble there&amp;#39;s this is going to make</text>
  <text start="1065.48" dur="7.35">more war but we see right now that the</text>
  <text start="1068.42" dur="6.9">latest estimations suggest that about 73</text>
  <text start="1072.83" dur="5.52">percent of Syrian civilians already live</text>
  <text start="1075.32" dur="5.96">in the safety provided by the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1078.35" dur="5.91">Armed Forces in the major Syrian cities</text>
  <text start="1081.28" dur="4.42">the Western media right now while</text>
  <text start="1084.26" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re out there and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1085.7" dur="4.98">that these escalation zones well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1088.34" dur="4.95">not de-escalation zones they&amp;#39;re no-fly</text>
  <text start="1090.68" dur="3.21">zones and this is going to be a huge</text>
  <text start="1093.29" dur="3.03">problem</text>
  <text start="1093.89" dur="5.07">well if to establish a no-fly zone over</text>
  <text start="1096.32" dur="4.11">the country what do they have to do they</text>
  <text start="1098.96" dur="3.96">have to destroy the air force they have</text>
  <text start="1100.43" dur="4.17">to destroy the runways to make it a</text>
  <text start="1102.92" dur="4.29">no-fly zone you just can&amp;#39;t tell them hey</text>
  <text start="1104.6" dur="5.55">by the way there&amp;#39;s no fly zone or you</text>
  <text start="1107.21" dur="6.33">set up defensive equipment and destroy</text>
  <text start="1110.15" dur="6.39">the Air Force and all they&amp;#39;ve done was</text>
  <text start="1113.54" dur="4.47">say this is a de-escalation zone the</text>
  <text start="1116.54" dur="2.65">United States cannot fly their planes</text>
  <text start="1118.01" dur="4.39">over this wears</text>
  <text start="1119.19" dur="5.82">setting up a defense system so if anyone</text>
  <text start="1122.4" dur="6.12">tries to do anything they will be shot</text>
  <text start="1125.01" dur="6.3">down now these zones are going to be</text>
  <text start="1128.52" dur="5.01">managed by Syria the Syrian government</text>
  <text start="1131.31" dur="3.3">will provide civil services they will</text>
  <text start="1133.53" dur="2.79">they&amp;#39;re going to rebuild the</text>
  <text start="1134.61" dur="5.67">infrastructure and in facilitate the</text>
  <text start="1136.32" dur="6.87">entry of humanitarian aid and in return</text>
  <text start="1140.28" dur="5.55">the opposition is not allowed to launch</text>
  <text start="1143.19" dur="5.16">any attacks from these zones nor are</text>
  <text start="1145.83" dur="5.07">they follow allowed to mobilize in any</text>
  <text start="1148.35" dur="6.78">way and if they are they&amp;#39;re immediately</text>
  <text start="1150.9" dur="6.5">arrested and they&amp;#39;re taking down so we</text>
  <text start="1155.13" dur="5.49">can see right now that things are</text>
  <text start="1157.4" dur="6.58">happening violence is dropping in this</text>
  <text start="1160.62" dur="7.08">area they&amp;#39;re protecting the west part of</text>
  <text start="1163.98" dur="6.99">Syria and they&amp;#39;re moving east now there</text>
  <text start="1167.7" dur="5.94">is this huge cyber attack that is</text>
  <text start="1170.97" dur="6.24">happening worldwide right now in a</text>
  <text start="1173.64" dur="7.14">matter of hours over 57,000 attacks have</text>
  <text start="1177.21" dur="5.22">been detected worldwide and 74 countries</text>
  <text start="1180.78" dur="4.59">around the globe have been affected and</text>
  <text start="1182.43" dur="5.4">the number of victims still well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1185.37" dur="4.56">growing right now and according to the</text>
  <text start="1187.83" dur="3.06">Russian multinational cyber security and</text>
  <text start="1189.93" dur="4.32">antivirus provider</text>
  <text start="1190.89" dur="7.8">well the ransomware right now is known</text>
  <text start="1194.25" dur="8.22">as one equipped 0r 2.0 or want to cry</text>
  <text start="1198.69" dur="5.58">and it&amp;#39;s believed to have affected the</text>
  <text start="1202.47" dur="3.89">national health services hospitals in</text>
  <text start="1204.27" dur="5.37">the UK and Spain&amp;#39;s biggest national</text>
  <text start="1206.36" dur="5.98">telecommunications firm now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1209.64" dur="3.66">interesting about all of this is that</text>
  <text start="1212.34" dur="3.3">it&amp;#39;s hitting many many different</text>
  <text start="1213.3" dur="6.27">countries but when you look at the</text>
  <text start="1215.64" dur="5.97">ransomware the screen shows that yes</text>
  <text start="1219.57" dur="5.07">your files have been encrypted if you</text>
  <text start="1221.61" dur="5.58">want them decrypted you need to pay now</text>
  <text start="1224.64" dur="5.52">you&amp;#39;re not paying in gold you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1227.19" dur="6.68">paying in silver you&amp;#39;re not paying in</text>
  <text start="1230.16" dur="8.46">dollars you&amp;#39;re paying in Bitcoin a</text>
  <text start="1233.87" dur="9.73">crypto currency now to me when I look at</text>
  <text start="1238.62" dur="8.16">this this shows me that maybe the</text>
  <text start="1243.6" dur="6.17">central bank the deep state might be</text>
  <text start="1246.78" dur="5.019">behind this because they don&amp;#39;t like a</text>
  <text start="1249.77" dur="6.269">decentralized</text>
  <text start="1251.799" dur="7.33">currency system and just lately Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="1256.039" dur="8.39">well that&amp;#39;s been going up in value quite</text>
  <text start="1259.129" dur="9.9">quickly and they can use this to say see</text>
  <text start="1264.429" dur="8.261">cryptocurrency is not good because look</text>
  <text start="1269.029" dur="7.171">what they can do with it and this looks</text>
  <text start="1272.69" dur="6.959">to me like this is part of the plan of a</text>
  <text start="1276.2" dur="7.17">central bank to make everyone not like</text>
  <text start="1279.649" dur="5.4">Bitcoin not like cryptocurrency and we</text>
  <text start="1283.37" dur="3.72">can see that all of this is happening</text>
  <text start="1285.049" dur="5.791">now how did this happen</text>
  <text start="1287.09" dur="6.329">well we know that the NSA we know the</text>
  <text start="1290.84" dur="5.91">deep state they&amp;#39;ve created all of these</text>
  <text start="1293.419" dur="5.941">holes in technology openings where other</text>
  <text start="1296.75" dur="5.82">people can get access to it so it&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="1299.36" dur="6.96">very easy for anyone to do this</text>
  <text start="1302.57" dur="6.42">especially those who know how to get</text>
  <text start="1306.32" dur="6.989">into the system who knows how to get</text>
  <text start="1308.99" dur="7.5">into all of these systems ah the NSA the</text>
  <text start="1313.309" dur="4.921">deep state they know exactly how to get</text>
  <text start="1316.49" dur="3.809">into these systems the intelligence</text>
  <text start="1318.23" dur="4.77">agencies because they&amp;#39;re the ones who</text>
  <text start="1320.299" dur="5.1">created it so it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1323" dur="3.96">holding the world ransom right now and</text>
  <text start="1325.399" dur="5.581">demanding everyone</text>
  <text start="1326.96" dur="7.26">do not use Bitcoin because criminals use</text>
