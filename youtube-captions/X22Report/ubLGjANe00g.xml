  <text start="166.18" dur="9.72">that&amp;#39;s it and everyone knows it</text>
  <text start="170.39" dur="9.12">and where we are today is the point of</text>
  <text start="175.9" dur="6.28">both sides battling out battling it out</text>
  <text start="179.51" dur="5.61">and who is going to control the</text>
  <text start="182.18" dur="4.23">narrative when they bring down the</text>
  <text start="185.12" dur="4.23">economy now</text>
  <text start="186.41" dur="7.77">we have two sides which is the Trump</text>
  <text start="189.35" dur="9.69">administration the central bank and the</text>
  <text start="194.18" dur="7.28">Cabal and the Trump administration with</text>
  <text start="199.04" dur="5.25">many different Patriots on his side are</text>
  <text start="201.46" dur="5.08">trying to lessen the blow when the</text>

  <text start="212.54" dur="5.79">it comes down extremely hard they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="215.39" dur="4.86">care if everyone loses everything and</text>
  <text start="218.33" dur="5.52">there are riots on the street actually</text>

  <text start="223.85" dur="5.88">want this so we&amp;#39;ll be talking about this</text>
  <text start="227.81" dur="4.44">in a little bit but let&amp;#39;s go over what</text>
  <text start="229.73" dur="4.32">is happening out in the economy remember</text>
  <text start="232.25" dur="5.73">I&amp;#39;m not talking about the stock market</text>

  <text start="237.98" dur="4.26">algorithms Trump has full control that</text>
  <text start="240.8" dur="3.21">he can make it go up he can make him go</text>
  <text start="242.24" dur="4.5">down it makes no difference at this</text>
  <text start="244.01" dur="4.65">point and this is why we see the market</text>
  <text start="246.74" dur="5.94">going up and up and up he&amp;#39;s using this</text>
  <text start="248.66" dur="7.44">against the central bank the Cabal he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="554.69" dur="6.69">talked about what is actually happening</text>
  <text start="558.55" dur="6.31">now I wanted to talk about what happened</text>
  <text start="561.38" dur="7.86">yesterday here and US Treasury secretary</text>

  <text start="578" dur="5.1">weak dollar would be good for US trade</text>
  <text start="580.43" dur="5.849">prospects the US dollar plunged to a</text>
  <text start="583.1" dur="5.339">three year low then and he</text>
  <text start="586.279" dur="3.451">try to you know walk it back saying in</text>
  <text start="588.439" dur="3.21">the short-term it really doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="589.73" dur="6.479">and in the long-term don&amp;#39;t worry it will</text>
  <text start="591.649" dur="6.99">be very very strong now everyone was out</text>
  <text start="596.209" dur="4.081">there saying the weak dollar I mean the</text>
  <text start="598.639" dur="3.75">u.s. always said there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="600.29" dur="6">strong dollar what why all of a sudden a</text>
  <text start="602.389" dur="7.411">weak dollar it made no sense munition I</text>
  <text start="606.29" dur="5.399">don&amp;#39;t believe he is part of the Trump</text>
  <text start="609.8" dur="4.529">administration I think he&amp;#39;s part of the</text>
  <text start="611.689" dur="4.531">cabal the central bank system he was</text>
  <text start="614.329" dur="3.841">placed there and this was in the</text>
  <text start="616.22" dur="4.5">beginning stages when Trump was coming</text>
  <text start="618.17" dur="4.109">in and he had to make some concessions</text>
  <text start="620.72" dur="4.109">on who he was gonna put into different</text>
  <text start="622.279" dur="5.25">positions and he&amp;#39;s a goldman sachs boy</text>
  <text start="624.829" dur="6.42">and i don&amp;#39;t believe that he is going to</text>
  <text start="627.529" dur="5.641">do anything that helps the u.s. this is</text>
  <text start="631.249" dur="4.411">why he had to go into the gold vaults to</text>
  <text start="633.17" dur="5.55">show that there was gold remember that</text>
  <text start="635.66" dur="5.13">that was a show to make everyone believe</text>
  <text start="638.72" dur="3.96">yeah look the central bank didn&amp;#39;t steal</text>
  <text start="640.79" dur="4.409">it the treasury didn&amp;#39;t take it it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="642.68" dur="4.829">there don&amp;#39;t worry about it he this was</text>
  <text start="645.199" dur="5.88">done on purpose now there aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="647.509" dur="6.93">important reasons that it is considered</text>
  <text start="651.079" dur="5.161">bad form for a sitting US treasury</text>
  <text start="654.439" dur="4.231">secretary or a sitting president to</text>
  <text start="656.24" dur="4.399">comment on the trading level of the US</text>
  <text start="658.67" dur="6.359">dollar now Trumpton make this comment</text>
  <text start="660.639" dur="7.68">the u.s. treasury secretary did a cheap</text>
  <text start="665.029" dur="5.16">dollar is yes it&amp;#39;s good for us exporters</text>
  <text start="668.319" dur="3.911">because it makes their products more</text>
  <text start="670.189" dur="4.681">competitively priced in foreign markets</text>
  <text start="672.23" dur="6.299">a cheaper dollar is decidedly not good</text>
  <text start="674.87" dur="6.449">for US consumers who have to pay more</text>
  <text start="678.529" dur="6.78">for imports from foreign countries with</text>
  <text start="681.319" dur="5.851">stronger currency i mean think about it</text>
  <text start="685.309" dur="3.241">go to the apparel department of any</text>
  <text start="687.17" dur="3.209">department store in the US and try to</text>
  <text start="688.55" dur="5.19">find an item clothing made in the US and</text>
  <text start="690.379" dur="6.781">you&amp;#39;ll see that most of them i would say</text>
  <text start="693.74" dur="5.519">99% of them are not or go to Lowe&amp;#39;s or</text>
  <text start="697.16" dur="4.729">Home Depot and try to find maybe like a</text>
  <text start="699.259" dur="4.92">lighting fixture or an electronics store</text>
  <text start="701.889" dur="5.86">you&amp;#39;re gonna find that most of the stuff</text>
  <text start="704.179" dur="6.27">is not made here purchases made by</text>
  <text start="707.749" dur="5.52">consumers in the US represent</text>
  <text start="710.449" dur="6.421">approximately two-thirds of total gross</text>
  <text start="713.269" dur="6.781">domestic product GDP a steadily</text>
  <text start="716.87" dur="6.24">weakening dollar presents a hardship</text>
  <text start="720.05" dur="4.71">to the everyday person of America where</text>
  <text start="723.11" dur="3.57">the bulk of their income goes to the</text>
  <text start="724.76" dur="6.15">necessities of life as the dollar</text>
  <text start="726.68" dur="6.99">weakens those costs increase while swage</text>
  <text start="730.91" dur="5.82">--is stagnate which means you see</text>
  <text start="733.67" dur="5.909">inflation you see it takes a lot more</text>
  <text start="736.73" dur="5.76">dollars to get the same loaf of bread it</text>
  <text start="739.579" dur="4.95">takes a lot more dollars to get that TV</text>

  <text start="748.25" dur="9.839">many people won&amp;#39;t be able to afford it</text>
  <text start="751.79" dur="8.789">and these increased consumer costs lead</text>
  <text start="758.089" dur="4.231">to rising inflation which could force</text>

  <text start="794.39" dur="8.22">they would have to raise rates quickly</text>
  <text start="797.38" dur="6.49">can they do this prior to 2008 2006 2007</text>
  <text start="802.61" dur="3.539">where they were raising rates like crazy</text>
  <text start="803.87" dur="7.409">and then all of sudden the economy came</text>

  <text start="867.17" dur="6.84">they they showed their hand they made a</text>

  <text start="889.16" dur="3.9">out of context and added that our</text>

  <text start="893.06" dur="4.65">strong again and strong in other ways</text>
  <text start="895.76" dur="3.99">too and the dollar will get stronger and</text>
  <text start="897.71" dur="5.22">stronger and ultimately I want to see a</text>
  <text start="899.75" dur="5.25">strong dollar he had to do something to</text>
  <text start="902.93" dur="5.25">stop it because he knew what was going</text>

  <text start="908.18" dur="6.69">agenda to shut the economy down now they</text>
  <text start="911" dur="5.52">would then have the narrative of why the</text>
