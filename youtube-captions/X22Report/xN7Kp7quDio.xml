  <text start="107.52" dur="7.03">now I wanted to start off with letting</text>
  <text start="112.06" dur="6.6">everyone know that Q said something very</text>
  <text start="114.55" dur="8.58">interesting that kind of explains the</text>
  <text start="118.66" dur="8.099">much much larger picture of what the</text>
  <text start="123.13" dur="6.42">real plan is and it&amp;#39;s not about just</text>
  <text start="126.759" dur="6.001">arresting people it&amp;#39;s just not about</text>
  <text start="129.55" dur="6.269">saving the economy saving the fed</text>
  <text start="132.76" dur="7.65">economy it&amp;#39;s about restoring the power</text>
  <text start="135.819" dur="7.491">to the people and to do this a lot of</text>
  <text start="140.41" dur="6.51">things have to happen it&amp;#39;s not about a</text>
  <text start="143.31" dur="5.289">four-year run in government and then</text>
  <text start="146.92" dur="3.99">allowing someone else to come in and</text>
  <text start="148.599" dur="7.351">allowing them to undo everything that</text>
  <text start="150.91" dur="8.91">has been done here so this plan is for</text>
  <text start="155.95" dur="4.2">the long haul here and the first part of</text>
  <text start="159.82" dur="3.18">it</text>
  <text start="160.15" dur="4.77">yes it&amp;#39;s making the rest and doing</text>
  <text start="163" dur="4.349">certain things to clean it up</text>
  <text start="164.92" dur="6.78">the other part of the plan is really to</text>
  <text start="167.349" dur="6.841">get rid of what the real problem is and</text>
  <text start="171.7" dur="6.06">that is the central bank and I think</text>
  <text start="174.19" dur="6.24">this is what Q is leading us up to and</text>
  <text start="177.76" dur="7.62">in the very beginning when Q first came</text>
  <text start="180.43" dur="6.33">out it was about the central bank and I</text>
  <text start="185.38" dur="3.24">think that had to go on the back burner</text>
  <text start="186.76" dur="5.28">because there was a lot of other things</text>
  <text start="188.62" dur="6.21">that Q and Trump team administration had</text>
  <text start="192.04" dur="5.25">to get out of the way first because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="194.83" dur="3.9">almost like a football team where you</text>
  <text start="197.29" dur="2.97">have blockers in the front and you have</text>
  <text start="198.73" dur="3.42">to get through them so you can get to</text>
  <text start="200.26" dur="4.5">the quarterback and you have to go</text>
  <text start="202.15" dur="7.53">through all these different stages well</text>
  <text start="204.76" dur="8.1">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people a lot of actors</text>
  <text start="209.68" dur="5.52">that are blocking the central blank the</text>
  <text start="212.86" dur="4.439">central bank so you just can&amp;#39;t go from</text>
  <text start="215.2" dur="5.759">here to there there&amp;#39;s many different</text>
  <text start="217.299" dur="7.011">steps but as we are watching all of this</text>
  <text start="220.959" dur="6.391">we are seeing the entire economic system</text>
  <text start="224.31" dur="6.16">breakdown right in front of us and I</text>
  <text start="227.35" dur="6.72">believe that this is being done as part</text>
  <text start="230.47" dur="5.609">of the plan because Trump is continually</text>
  <text start="234.07" dur="3.84">contradicting the Fed he&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="236.079" dur="4.47">stop actually he&amp;#39;s probably going to</text>
  <text start="237.91" dur="5.27">continue with it and accelerate it as we</text>
  <text start="240.549" dur="5.461">go on and the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="243.18" dur="6.04">economists financial pundits we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="246.01" dur="5.49">starting to see all of them say hey slow</text>
  <text start="249.22" dur="3.78">this down because in the beginning this</text>
  <text start="251.5" dur="4.26">was part of the plan to bring the</text>
  <text start="253" dur="5.16">economy down around Trump and blame it</text>
  <text start="255.76" dur="5.19">on him but now the economy&amp;#39;s doing well</text>
  <text start="258.16" dur="5.04">and the Fed well they have the spotlight</text>
  <text start="260.95" dur="3.9">on them right now they&amp;#39;re the one that</text>
  <text start="263.2" dur="3.39">everyone is looking at and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="264.85" dur="4.35">saying well wait a minute the economy is</text>
  <text start="266.59" dur="6.9">doing really well and the Fed is raising</text>
  <text start="269.2" dur="6.42">rates we see what is really happening</text>
  <text start="273.49" dur="5.34">here the Fed raises rates and things</text>
  <text start="275.62" dur="4.26">start to break down if we look at the</text>
  <text start="278.83" dur="4.11">you Mitch</text>
  <text start="279.88" dur="5.75">we can see that people are starting to</text>
  <text start="282.94" dur="5.49">say you know the economy is not doing</text>
  <text start="285.63" dur="4.99">that great because I can feel it on the</text>
  <text start="288.43" dur="5.16">people level yeah maybe the statistical</text>
  <text start="290.62" dur="6.18">numbers are fine but you Mitch kind of</text>
  <text start="293.59" dur="5.07">explains what is going on here and humid</text>
  <text start="296.8" dur="5.04">starts off with inch</text>
  <text start="298.66" dur="5.72">rate expectations have always traced the</text>
  <text start="301.84" dur="5.52">outlines of economic cycles as</text>
  <text start="304.38" dur="5.35">expansions lengthen more consumers would</text>
  <text start="307.36" dur="4.71">expect interest rate increases pushing</text>
  <text start="309.73" dur="4.26">the series to cyclical lows then</text>
  <text start="312.07" dur="4.14">consumers would suddenly reverse course</text>
  <text start="313.99" dur="3.35">lowering expectations just as downturns</text>
  <text start="316.21" dur="4.83">were about to commence</text>
  <text start="317.34" dur="7.03">note that the recession dating lags but</text>
  <text start="321.04" dur="5.25">by about one year meaning that expected</text>
  <text start="324.37" dur="3.93">declines and rates are recorded about</text>
  <text start="326.29" dur="4.56">one year before the official</text>
  <text start="328.3" dur="4.02">announcement while there is no reason to</text>
  <text start="330.85" dur="2.99">anticipate a sudden change in</text>
  <text start="332.32" dur="4.08">expectations in the months ahead</text>
  <text start="333.84" dur="4.84">consumers have begun to resist rising</text>
  <text start="336.4" dur="5.76">interest rates on purchases of housing</text>
  <text start="338.68" dur="5.22">and vehicles hopefully this time the Fed</text>
  <text start="342.16" dur="3.9">will manage interest rates to avoid</text>
  <text start="343.9" dur="6.84">hitting the threshold that causes</text>
  <text start="346.06" dur="8.24">widespread postponement as has been true</text>
  <text start="350.74" dur="7.04">in the past now they show this graph</text>
  <text start="354.3" dur="7.39">that every time interest rates move up</text>
  <text start="357.78" dur="7.06">we have a recession or a depression a</text>
  <text start="361.69" dur="5.7">crash of the system and then they have</text>
  <text start="364.84" dur="5.19">to drop the interest rates so it is</text>
  <text start="367.39" dur="4.71">starting to show that this is going to</text>
  <text start="370.03" dur="3.84">be a big problem and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="372.1" dur="4.71">interesting is that credit card</text>
  <text start="373.87" dur="6.03">delinquencies they are blowing through</text>
  <text start="376.81" dur="5.22">financial crisis peek at the four</text>
  <text start="379.9" dur="5.49">thousand seven hundred and five smaller</text>
  <text start="382.03" dur="6.03">US banks now the bigger banks they off</text>
  <text start="385.39" dur="6.15">loaded all these credit cards and they</text>
  <text start="388.06" dur="6.45">allowed smaller banks to take on the</text>
  <text start="391.54" dur="4.95">subprime lenders the big banks didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="394.51" dur="3.87">want to take them on because they knew</text>
  <text start="396.49" dur="3.24">eventually what was going to happen the</text>
  <text start="398.38" dur="2.76">system was going to come down and it was</text>
  <text start="399.73" dur="6.17">going to hurt them and I think their</text>
  <text start="401.14" dur="8.15">plan was to have all these smaller banks</text>
  <text start="405.9" dur="6.1">4705 of them most of them go under and</text>
  <text start="409.29" dur="5.02">they would just be acquired by the</text>
  <text start="412" dur="4.77">bigger banks and this way we would only</text>
  <text start="414.31" dur="4.59">have what five or six financial</text>
  <text start="416.77" dur="4.8">institutions a lot easier to control</text>
  <text start="418.9" dur="3.81">than thousands of them and I think this</text>
  <text start="421.57" dur="2.94">was their plan but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="422.71" dur="5.16">right now is that credit card</text>
  <text start="424.51" dur="6.27">delinquencies they have shot up to 6.2</text>
  <text start="427.87" dur="4.24">percent in the smaller banks not so much</text>
  <text start="430.78" dur="4.81">in the larger banks</text>
  <text start="432.11" dur="6.36">what does this mean this means the</text>
  <text start="435.59" dur="4.95">everyday person they are struggling is</text>
  <text start="438.47" dur="4.26">the credit card delinquency is going to</text>
  <text start="440.54" dur="4.83">bring down the banks now what this means</text>
  <text start="442.73" dur="6.75">is that the everyday person the subprime</text>
  <text start="445.37" dur="6.87">people they cannot pay their credit</text>
  <text start="449.48" dur="5.07">cards because most of the time these are</text>
  <text start="452.24" dur="4.65">hooked to about 30% interest they have</text>
  <text start="454.55" dur="5.76">late fees and they just keep piling on</text>
  <text start="456.89" dur="5.22">and before you know it your bill which</text>
  <text start="460.31" dur="3.48">was maybe four or five thousand is now</text>
  <text start="462.11" dur="3.75">seven thousand and you just can&amp;#39;t keep</text>
  <text start="463.79" dur="4.41">up with it because they just keep piling</text>
  <text start="465.86" dur="5.4">it on and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="468.2" dur="4.71">now and this tells us that the consumers</text>
  <text start="471.26" dur="3.57">have been using their credit cards and</text>
  <text start="472.91" dur="3.39">now since the FICO scores you know have</text>
  <text start="474.83" dur="2.67">been readjusted more people gonna get</text>
  <text start="476.3" dur="4.08">credit cards and they&amp;#39;re gonna get more</text>
  <text start="477.5" dur="4.08">from these smaller banks a lot of people</text>
  <text start="480.38" dur="3.93">are going to be in trouble gonna be in a</text>
  <text start="481.58" dur="5.25">lot of debt and they&amp;#39;re not gonna see</text>
  <text start="484.31" dur="4.35">raises they&amp;#39;re not gonna see the help</text>
  <text start="486.83" dur="4.23">that they really need after they start</text>
  <text start="488.66" dur="3.93">putting more of the currency on these</text>
  <text start="491.06" dur="3.21">credit cards they&amp;#39;re gonna put</text>
  <text start="492.59" dur="4.98">themselves further and further into debt</text>
  <text start="494.27" dur="4.98">and all of a sudden with all these late</text>
  <text start="497.57" dur="3.81">fees and interest rate hikes and</text>
  <text start="499.25" dur="3.18">everything else a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="501.38" dur="3.18">going to hurt but this is how the</text>
  <text start="502.43" dur="4.98">central bank works they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="504.56" dur="4.32">people really to get ahead they want the</text>
  <text start="507.41" dur="3.42">majority of the people and yes there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="508.88" dur="4.77">certain people that do get ahead but the</text>
  <text start="510.83" dur="6.45">mass majority of the people they are</text>
  <text start="513.65" dur="7.829">enslaved to debt and they can never get</text>
  <text start="517.28" dur="6.21">out of it now we know the central bank</text>
  <text start="521.479" dur="4.021">the Fed they&amp;#39;ve been raising rates and I</text>
  <text start="523.49" dur="4.8">do believe that Powell is working with</text>
  <text start="525.5" dur="5.3">from we see now and we&amp;#39;ve heard from</text>
  <text start="528.29" dur="5.43">Wall Street Journal Jim Cramer CNBC</text>
  <text start="530.8" dur="4.42">where they said hey maybe we should slow</text>
  <text start="533.72" dur="3.81">down on the interest rate hikes</text>
  <text start="535.22" dur="3.32">maybe we should pause and wait to see</text>
  <text start="537.53" dur="3.62">what happens</text>
  <text start="538.54" dur="5.95">well what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="541.15" dur="6.01">Realtors right now they are urging the</text>
  <text start="544.49" dur="5.1">Fed to stop hiking while existing homes</text>
  <text start="547.16" dur="5.57">right now they have slumped the most</text>
  <text start="549.59" dur="5.72">since 2014 they&amp;#39;re down 5.1 percent</text>
  <text start="552.73" dur="5.17">realtors are starting to realize that</text>
  <text start="555.31" dur="6.36">less and less people are coming out to</text>
  <text start="557.9" dur="7.37">purchase homes it&amp;#39;s going to get worse</text>
  <text start="561.67" dur="6.42">now we have two problems</text>
  <text start="565.27" dur="5.43">the housing prices are way too high and</text>
  <text start="568.09" dur="5.79">you have interest rates moving up</text>
  <text start="570.7" dur="5.16">it throws many many many people out of</text>
  <text start="573.88" dur="4.11">the market we discussed this before in</text>
  <text start="575.86" dur="4.2">many many reports before the Fed even</text>
  <text start="577.99" dur="5.1">started to raise rates we knew that this</text>
  <text start="580.06" dur="6.87">was going to happen and because of all</text>
  <text start="583.09" dur="6.86">this we see us home refinancing it has</text>
  <text start="586.93" dur="7.65">hit an all-time nu low and it&amp;#39;s at an</text>
  <text start="589.95" dur="7.09">18-year low which tells you that what</text>
  <text start="594.58" dur="4.65">the Fed is doing it is hurting the</text>
  <text start="597.04" dur="4.41">economy but we knew this the economy is</text>
  <text start="599.23" dur="4.86">in an illusion it&amp;#39;s fake</text>
  <text start="601.45" dur="6.33">all this stimulus and everything that</text>
  <text start="604.09" dur="6">they did is fake all the statistical</text>
  <text start="607.78" dur="5.94">number is GDP unemployment stock market</text>
  <text start="610.09" dur="6.15">fake because all they had to do is raise</text>
  <text start="613.72" dur="5.55">the rates and you see the true color of</text>
  <text start="616.24" dur="6.48">the economy and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="619.27" dur="6.21">now the Federal Reserve says they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="622.72" dur="4.62">going to be swayed by recent stock</text>
  <text start="625.48" dur="4.95">market declines I wouldn&amp;#39;t expect</text>
  <text start="627.34" dur="5.88">anything less I believe that the plan is</text>
  <text start="630.43" dur="6.09">to move forward continually raising the</text>
  <text start="633.22" dur="6.87">rates non-stop until what the system</text>
  <text start="636.52" dur="6.18">comes down now Trump is out there and he</text>
  <text start="640.09" dur="7.38">does what he does best he&amp;#39;s criticizing</text>
  <text start="642.7" dur="7.61">the Fed he came out yesterday and said</text>
  <text start="647.47" dur="6">the Federal Reserve is the problem and</text>
  <text start="650.31" dur="5.86">the interest rates should not be going</text>
  <text start="653.47" dur="4.5">higher he said I like to see the Fed</text>
  <text start="656.17" dur="4.05">with a lower interest rate</text>
  <text start="657.97" dur="4.5">I think the rates too high I think we</text>
  <text start="660.22" dur="4.23">have much more of a Fed problem than we</text>
  <text start="662.47" dur="6.12">have a problem with anyone else</text>
  <text start="664.45" dur="8.76">whoa we have a Fed problem more than a</text>
  <text start="668.59" dur="7.32">problem with anyone else and think about</text>
  <text start="673.21" dur="6.06">that for a second he&amp;#39;s continually out</text>
  <text start="675.91" dur="5.28">there blaming the Fed this leads us to</text>

  <text start="687.01" dur="4.26">rest of it later in the next report but</text>
  <text start="689.32" dur="6.06">I believe that this fits into this</text>
  <text start="691.27" dur="6.3">section and it reads as follows this</text>
  <text start="695.38" dur="3.14">election was not about fixing the</text>
  <text start="697.57" dur="5.67">economy</text>
  <text start="698.52" dur="8.35">trade borders military protecting our</text>
  <text start="703.24" dur="7.86">children etc also another corrupt</text>
  <text start="706.87" dur="8.34">politician or insider can simply undo it</text>
  <text start="711.1" dur="6.3">with brackets bold band-aid this was not</text>
  <text start="715.21" dur="4.47">simply another four-year election but a</text>
  <text start="717.4" dur="4.62">crossroads in the history of our</text>
  <text start="719.68" dur="5.82">civilization that will determine whether</text>
  <text start="722.02" dur="7.82">or not we the people all caps reclaim</text>
  <text start="725.5" dur="7.05">control over our government which means</text>
  <text start="729.84" dur="6.36">Trump is not in there to fix the Federal</text>
  <text start="732.55" dur="5.91">Reserve economy the central bank economy</text>
  <text start="736.2" dur="2.86">Trump is not in there and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="738.46" dur="4.59">are not in there</text>
  <text start="739.06" dur="7.77">to band-aid everything that the deep</text>
  <text start="743.05" dur="6.75">state has done in the past Trump and the</text>
  <text start="746.83" dur="7.83">Patriots are in there to reset the</text>
  <text start="749.8" dur="7.65">entire system that means the economic</text>
  <text start="754.66" dur="3.63">system that means he&amp;#39;s there to get rid</text>
  <text start="757.45" dur="2.97">of the central bank</text>
  <text start="758.29" dur="4.83">that means he&amp;#39;s there to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="760.42" dur="4.5">deep state that means he&amp;#39;s there to get</text>
  <text start="763.12" dur="3.39">rid of the corrupt individuals in</text>
  <text start="764.92" dur="4.5">government and that means a reset of</text>
  <text start="766.51" dur="7.32">government and that means restoring the</text>
  <text start="769.42" dur="6.69">the power back to the people the way you</text>
  <text start="773.83" dur="5.63">do this is you put the people back in</text>
  <text start="776.11" dur="7.26">control of creating their own currency</text>
  <text start="779.46" dur="7.69">so Q is telling us that this plan is</text>
  <text start="783.37" dur="5.87">much much larger than anyone thinks yes</text>
  <text start="787.15" dur="6.12">it&amp;#39;s great that people will be arrested</text>
  <text start="789.24" dur="6.13">but this is not a band-aid fix this is</text>
  <text start="793.27" dur="6.21">an all-or-nothing fix because as we know</text>
  <text start="795.37" dur="8.969">if Trump the Patriots they don&amp;#39;t succeed</text>
  <text start="799.48" dur="8.76">in this guess what the whole plan is a</text>
  <text start="804.339" dur="8.521">failure because someone else will step</text>
  <text start="808.24" dur="7.17">into the presidency the deep state the</text>
  <text start="812.86" dur="5.37">central bankers will once again fill</text>
  <text start="815.41" dur="8.27">those positions and we&amp;#39;ll be back</text>
  <text start="818.23" dur="9.87">exactly where we were so this is a much</text>
  <text start="823.68" dur="7.9">larger plan then anyone has envisioned</text>
  <text start="828.1" dur="4.5">and this is not a little tiny fix this</text>
  <text start="831.58" dur="6.33">is why when you see</text>
  <text start="832.6" dur="8.01">tariffs you see trade coming into</text>
  <text start="837.91" dur="5.909">question you see all these different</text>
