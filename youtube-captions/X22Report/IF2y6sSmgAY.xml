  <text start="99.44" dur="4.819">before actually if we go back to two</text>
  <text start="101.66" dur="4.47">thousand eight in that month of August</text>
  <text start="104.259" dur="5.22">everything&amp;#39;s starting to look very very</text>
  <text start="106.13" dur="7.219">similar to that with a huge difference</text>
  <text start="109.479" dur="9.401">the difference is is the economy is</text>
  <text start="113.349" dur="7.481">worse off than it was in 2008 and I know</text>
  <text start="118.88" dur="4.11">the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="120.83" dur="5.129">they&amp;#39;re always out there telling us how</text>
  <text start="122.99" dur="4.95">great the economy is how real estate is</text>
  <text start="125.959" dur="5.791">booming retails booming everything is</text>
  <text start="127.94" dur="6.93">fine you&amp;#39;re a nut job if you think that</text>
  <text start="131.75" dur="5.52">the economy is not doing well well the</text>
  <text start="134.87" dur="5.36">question I have is if everything is</text>
  <text start="137.27" dur="7.32">going so well everyone has a job</text>
  <text start="140.23" dur="7.089">everyone&amp;#39;s purchasing houses why in the</text>
  <text start="144.59" dur="6.33">second quarter of this year is home</text>
  <text start="147.319" dur="6.201">ownership in the United States at its</text>
  <text start="150.92" dur="5.399">lowest level in more than 50 years</text>
  <text start="153.52" dur="5.249">there&amp;#39;s a lot more people that are being</text>
  <text start="156.319" dur="6.14">born now the populations and has grown a</text>
  <text start="158.769" dur="5.631">lot of people taking out student loans</text>
  <text start="162.459" dur="4.971">why is home</text>
  <text start="164.4" dur="5.16">ownership solo why are there only</text>
  <text start="167.43" dur="4.639">sixty-three percent of the u.s. homes</text>
  <text start="169.56" dur="5.16">that are owned today by Americans</text>
  <text start="172.069" dur="6.581">because when we look at this you would</text>
  <text start="174.72" dur="6.719">think that we would all be owning homes</text>
  <text start="178.65" dur="4.53">the homeownership rate would be at</text>
  <text start="181.439" dur="3.481">all-time highs if the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="183.18" dur="4.529">so well with the unemployment rate of</text>
  <text start="184.92" dur="6.81">four point nine percent with the economy</text>
  <text start="187.709" dur="7.65">doing so well but when you look at this</text>
  <text start="191.73" dur="5.819">you have to realize there&amp;#39;s 40 countries</text>
  <text start="195.359" dur="4.621">on three continents including China</text>
  <text start="197.549" dur="8.94">Singapore Mexico and Brazil that have</text>
  <text start="199.98" dur="11.64">higher home ownership rates so when we</text>
  <text start="206.489" dur="10.351">look at this the economy cannot be doing</text>
  <text start="211.62" dur="7.289">well if the everyday person is not going</text>
  <text start="216.84" dur="4.41">out saying I have this incredible job on</text>
  <text start="218.909" dur="4.741">making money and now I&amp;#39;m going to go buy</text>
  <text start="221.25" dur="5.459">a house it&amp;#39;s not happening same thing in</text>
  <text start="223.65" dur="4.769">retail retail is contracting stores are</text>
  <text start="226.709" dur="5">closing and it&amp;#39;s not because of the</text>
  <text start="228.419" dur="6.361">online sales because we would see an</text>
  <text start="231.709" dur="6.191">incredible increase in online sales</text>
  <text start="234.78" dur="4.319">which we are not seeing whatsoever so</text>
  <text start="237.9" dur="4.11">when we start to look at all these</text>
  <text start="239.099" dur="6.06">economic indicators they&amp;#39;re all flashing</text>
  <text start="242.01" dur="6.559">a red signal at us saying that we are</text>
  <text start="245.159" dur="7.41">heading towards this Great Depression</text>
  <text start="248.569" dur="6.581">when we look at wholesale inventories we</text>
  <text start="252.569" dur="5.251">see hotel sales they have surged by one</text>
  <text start="255.15" dur="7.62">point nine percent month-on-month most</text>
  <text start="257.82" dur="8.64">since September 2012 and we see that</text>
  <text start="262.77" dur="6">sales right now remain lower at negative</text>
  <text start="266.46" dur="4.86">four point four five percent</text>
  <text start="268.77" dur="4.67">year-on-year and inventories are higher</text>
  <text start="271.32" dur="5.01">at point two four percent year-on-year</text>
  <text start="273.44" dur="5.5">this move notch the wholesale</text>
  <text start="276.33" dur="6">inventories to sales ratio down to one</text>
  <text start="278.94" dur="6.21">point three three but this remains deep</text>
  <text start="282.33" dur="4.2">in recession territory despite this</text>
  <text start="285.15" dur="3.93">little improvement that we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="286.53" dur="8.129">right now and it&amp;#39;s been in this area for</text>
  <text start="289.08" dur="8.37">quite a while now very interestingly us</text>
  <text start="294.659" dur="3.451">productivity it is a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="297.45" dur="4.77">it</text>
  <text start="298.11" dur="8.16">by 0.6% missing the positive point four</text>
  <text start="302.22" dur="9.48">percent expectation this right now is</text>
  <text start="306.27" dur="10.5">the third quarterly decline in a row now</text>
  <text start="311.7" dur="7.38">the first time this happened was back in</text>
  <text start="316.77" dur="4.71">nineteen seventy-nine and this</text>
  <text start="319.08" dur="8.04">three-quarter plunge this is the biggest</text>
  <text start="321.48" dur="8.49">drop in productivity since 1993 and this</text>
  <text start="327.12" dur="6.51">is the first year on year drop since the</text>
  <text start="329.97" dur="6.36">2nd quarter of 2013 so when we look at</text>
  <text start="333.63" dur="6.57">this there&amp;#39;s only one word for this it</text>
  <text start="336.33" dur="8.1">is a complete disaster real worker</text>
  <text start="340.2" dur="10.61">productivity is collapsing but by back</text>
  <text start="344.43" dur="11.4">of the corporate stocks is soaring so</text>
  <text start="350.81" dur="8.89">what are we seeing here America is in</text>
  <text start="355.83" dur="7.98">trouble productivity is dead in the</text>
  <text start="359.7" dur="7.89">water and if we look at this and we go</text>
  <text start="363.81" dur="9.21">back in time we see us productivity it</text>
  <text start="367.59" dur="9.53">has peaked in 1972 this was the period</text>
  <text start="373.02" dur="8.19">we went off the gold standard since then</text>
  <text start="377.12" dur="11.74">productivity has decreased the trend</text>
  <text start="381.21" dur="9.63">line is down and this is not good if we</text>
  <text start="388.86" dur="6">just isolate the 15 years of us</text>
  <text start="390.84" dur="9.12">productivity growth it is on par with a</text>
  <text start="394.86" dur="12.48">slave economy which they were able to</text>
  <text start="399.96" dur="11.01">achieve 200 years ago so are we in a</text>
  <text start="407.34" dur="5.25">slave economy right now it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="410.97" dur="5.04">feel that way it feels like you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="412.59" dur="6.65">continually working more and more making</text>
  <text start="416.01" dur="5.67">less and less paying more and more taxes</text>
  <text start="419.24" dur="3.67">the US government central bankers are</text>
  <text start="421.68" dur="5.04">telling you that you need to pay even</text>
  <text start="422.91" dur="7.05">more than that so in all intensive</text>
  <text start="426.72" dur="5.66">purposes we are in some type of slave</text>
  <text start="429.96" dur="2.42">economy</text>
  <text start="432.84" dur="8.38">because we&amp;#39;re working for the central</text>
  <text start="436.48" dur="9.27">bankers we&amp;#39;re working to pay off the</text>
  <text start="441.22" dur="7.05">interest on their debt because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="445.75" dur="4.56">creating this money out of this currency</text>
  <text start="448.27" dur="7.49">out of thin air loaning it to the</text>
  <text start="450.31" dur="8.82">government and they are all enslaving us</text>
  <text start="455.76" dur="5.79">to pay it all back to pay them where</text>
  <text start="459.13" dur="5.67">then they take this paper currency and</text>
  <text start="461.55" dur="6.73">they go around the world and they</text>
  <text start="464.8" dur="5.25">purchase up the natural resources they</text>
  <text start="468.28" dur="4.47">take the ports from countries for</text>
  <text start="470.05" dur="7.05">pennies on the dollar they buy mines</text>
  <text start="472.75" dur="8.19">they buy land they buy real hard assets</text>
  <text start="477.1" dur="6.87">and they get rid of the paper who keeps</text>
  <text start="480.94" dur="4.95">the paper one of the people keep the</text>
  <text start="483.97" dur="4.44">paper because they believed and they</text>
  <text start="485.89" dur="4.47">were brainwashed over time that this is</text>
  <text start="488.41" dur="3.99">currency it&amp;#39;s backed by The Full Faith</text>
  <text start="490.36" dur="5.49">of the US government this piece of paper</text>
  <text start="492.4" dur="6.06">with ink on it well if you go back in</text>
  <text start="495.85" dur="5.49">time the US has had many pieces of paper</text>
  <text start="498.46" dur="5.55">with ink on it actually one of them</text>
  <text start="501.34" dur="5.07">before 1913 was actually a gold</text>
  <text start="504.01" dur="4.53">certificate where you took it and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="506.41" dur="6.75">able to trade that in for actual gold</text>
  <text start="508.54" dur="6.6">today you can&amp;#39;t do that and a lot of the</text>
  <text start="513.16" dur="4.8">paper currency going back in time is</text>
  <text start="515.14" dur="4.71">completely disappeared because the</text>
  <text start="517.96" dur="5.46">system&amp;#39;s continually reset once a</text>
  <text start="519.85" dur="6.66">central bank is involved if they are in</text>
  <text start="523.42" dur="6.03">control the system is doomed the system</text>
  <text start="526.51" dur="6">was designed to be doomed over time</text>
  <text start="529.45" dur="6.69">because it cannot work because the debt</text>
  <text start="532.51" dur="7.8">continually increases the interest on</text>
  <text start="536.14" dur="5.78">the debt increases and the only way it</text>
  <text start="540.31" dur="5.04">works is to spread more and more debt</text>
  <text start="541.92" dur="9.4">why would you want an economy that is</text>
  <text start="545.35" dur="9.81">based on debt it makes no sense it makes</text>
  <text start="551.32" dur="8.16">no sense to have a country that is based</text>
  <text start="555.16" dur="6.15">on debt but we were convinced that this</text>
  <text start="559.48" dur="4.14">is the way it&amp;#39;s supposed to be well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="561.31" dur="4.44">not because in the beginning when our</text>
  <text start="563.62" dur="4.17">founding fathers found this country</text>
  <text start="565.75" dur="5.04">the entire system was not based on debt</text>
  <text start="567.79" dur="6.99">it was based on a system where was</text>
  <text start="570.79" dur="7.11">backed by gold silver where the</text>
  <text start="574.78" dur="5.4">government individuals in the government</text>
  <text start="577.9" dur="4.05">they just couldn&amp;#39;t create funds out of</text>
  <text start="580.18" dur="4.62">thin air because they had to have the</text>
  <text start="581.95" dur="4.41">gold I had to have the silver and you</text>
  <text start="584.8" dur="4.02">just can&amp;#39;t create gold and silver out of</text>
  <text start="586.36" dur="5.66">thin air that was like checks and</text>
  <text start="588.82" dur="7.89">balances to make sure that the system</text>
  <text start="592.02" dur="10.78">was sound so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="596.71" dur="9.26">is that the entire system is continually</text>
  <text start="602.8" dur="5.73">collapsing it&amp;#39;s not going to improve</text>
  <text start="605.97" dur="4.74">we&amp;#39;ve seen this over time we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="608.53" dur="6.81">tracking it watching it recording it and</text>
  <text start="610.71" dur="6.52">if we go back to three years if we go</text>
  <text start="615.34" dur="5.52">back to two thousand eight the system</text>
  <text start="617.23" dur="5.49">has not improved at all the only thing</text>
  <text start="620.86" dur="5.94">that&amp;#39;s improved is the way the</text>
  <text start="622.72" dur="7.46">government manipulates statistics the</text>
  <text start="626.8" dur="9.45">way they blow up bubbles that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="630.18" dur="10.18">otherwise this system is coming down one</text>
  <text start="636.25" dur="7.29">way or another the system is doomed and</text>
  <text start="640.36" dur="5.31">it will collapse listen everyone thanks</text>
  <text start="643.54" dur="6.049">a lot for listening be well be safe and</text>
  <text start="645.67" dur="3.919">especially be prepared thanks a lot</text>
