  <text start="125.36" dur="2.94">for a very long time</text>
  <text start="126.47" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;ve been in power for a very long</text>
  <text start="128.3" dur="5.1">time and we&amp;#39;re approaching that time</text>

  <text start="133.4" dur="4.02">saying just Trump and Patriots and many</text>
  <text start="135.02" dur="5.7">others who are going to approach the</text>
  <text start="137.42" dur="5.97">central bank and make a move to get rid</text>
  <text start="140.72" dur="4.95">of it now we need to understand that the</text>
  <text start="143.39" dur="5.34">gold price here in the United States and</text>
  <text start="145.67" dur="4.86">around the world has been manipulated by</text>
  <text start="148.73" dur="4.29">the central banks it&amp;#39;s been well</text>
  <text start="150.53" dur="3.39">documented it&amp;#39;s a fact even though the</text>
  <text start="153.02" dur="3.299">corporate media is not out there</text>
  <text start="153.92" dur="5.789">publicizing it banks have gotten into</text>
  <text start="156.319" dur="6.301">trouble and basically the central banks</text>
  <text start="159.709" dur="6.871">have a long and colorful history of</text>
  <text start="162.62" dur="6.39">manipulating the gold price now central</text>
  <text start="166.58" dur="5.4">bankers they&amp;#39;re terrified of gold they</text>
  <text start="169.01" dur="5.58">are terrified of gold because one it is</text>
  <text start="171.98" dur="4.32">an inflation barometer it&amp;#39;s an indicator</text>
  <text start="174.59" dur="4.56">of the relative strength of fine</text>
  <text start="176.3" dur="6.18">currencies the gold price influences</text>
  <text start="179.15" dur="6.39">interest rates and bond prices and the</text>
  <text start="182.48" dur="3.81">central bankers they don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="185.54" dur="4.699">everyday</text>
  <text start="186.29" dur="6.99">person to realize what gold is and</text>
  <text start="190.239" dur="5.56">central bankers are very aware of gold</text>
  <text start="193.28" dur="4.739">they hold large quantities of it in</text>
  <text start="195.799" dur="4.86">their vaults as a store value and as</text>
  <text start="198.019" dur="7.231">financial insurance but they&amp;#39;re always</text>
  <text start="200.659" dur="8.821">on guard against allowing gold to be</text>
  <text start="205.25" dur="6.319">controlled by the free market they need</text>
  <text start="209.48" dur="4.379">to control it now</text>
  <text start="211.569" dur="6.34">the biz which is the Bank of</text>
  <text start="213.859" dur="8.071">International Settlement they have a law</text>
  <text start="217.909" dur="7.311">on to themselves they don&amp;#39;t answer to</text>
  <text start="221.93" dur="7.19">anyone there&amp;#39;s no government that</text>
  <text start="225.22" dur="6.43">controls them they are their own entity</text>
  <text start="229.12" dur="5.319">we need to understand that the central</text>
  <text start="231.65" dur="5.85">bankers they do not report to a</text>
  <text start="234.439" dur="5.401">government to a people to a group they</text>
  <text start="237.5" dur="6.03">have no allegiance except to themselves</text>
  <text start="239.84" dur="7.2">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the</text>
  <text start="243.53" dur="6.539">central banker since the 60s have been</text>
  <text start="247.04" dur="7.259">nipple aiding the Golda Price in the</text>
  <text start="250.069" dur="6.061">public domain back then and still today</text>
  <text start="254.299" dur="5.511">they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating the gold</text>
  <text start="256.13" dur="6.69">through the gully London gold pool and</text>
  <text start="259.81" dur="6.039">it has changed a little bit as we move</text>
  <text start="262.82" dur="7.29">forward because back then gold was held</text>
  <text start="265.849" dur="6.181">at 35,000 hands an ounce and here the US</text>
  <text start="270.11" dur="4.23">Treasury and a consortium of central</text>
  <text start="272.03" dur="5.389">banks from Western Europe explicitly</text>
  <text start="274.34" dur="5.49">kept the gold price near $35 an ounce</text>
  <text start="277.419" dur="3.821">coordinating their operation from the</text>
  <text start="279.83" dur="3.93">Bank of International Settlements in</text>
  <text start="281.24" dur="5.07">Basel Switzerland while using the Bank</text>
  <text start="283.76" dur="6.719">of England in London as a transaction</text>
  <text start="286.31" dur="8.22">agent now this price manipulation broke</text>
  <text start="290.479" dur="7.081">down in 1968 when the Treasury ran out</text>
  <text start="294.53" dur="6.03">of good delivery gold which triggered</text>
  <text start="297.56" dur="5.07">the move to a free market gold price</text>
  <text start="300.56" dur="4.32">this is what also triggered the</text>
  <text start="302.63" dur="4.259">speculators looking for their gold and</text>
  <text start="304.88" dur="4.23">the central banks coming off their gold</text>
  <text start="306.889" dur="5.31">standard and they brought the system on</text>
  <text start="309.11" dur="6.929">to the petro dollar system and we can</text>
  <text start="312.199" dur="5.551">see that since this time back in the 70s</text>
  <text start="316.039" dur="2.37">of the early 70s when we came off the</text>
  <text start="317.75" dur="1.88">gold standard</text>
  <text start="318.409" dur="3.651">they needed a way</text>
  <text start="319.63" dur="6.8">to control the gold prices so what did</text>
  <text start="322.06" dur="7.31">they do they created the paper market</text>
  <text start="326.43" dur="6.52">the gold futures they were launched in</text>
  <text start="329.37" dur="7.53">1975 the primary reason for their</text>
  <text start="332.95" dur="6.6">introduction was what to create an</text>
  <text start="336.9" dur="4.75">alternative to the physical market that</text>
  <text start="339.55" dur="5.13">would siphon off demand for gold</text>
  <text start="341.65" dur="5.55">creating trading that would dwarf the</text>
  <text start="344.68" dur="5.34">physical market which would also ramped</text>
  <text start="347.2" dur="6.87">up volatility which in turn would deter</text>
  <text start="350.02" dur="6.53">investors from investing in gold gold</text>
  <text start="354.07" dur="6.09">futures are also freshly backed and</text>
  <text start="356.55" dur="7.38">overwhelmingly cash settled because they</text>
  <text start="360.16" dur="7.67">don&amp;#39;t have a goal to settle these these</text>
  <text start="363.93" dur="6.96">transactions the gold lending market is</text>
  <text start="367.83" dur="5.83">totally opaque and secretive and though</text>
  <text start="370.89" dur="5.08">obligatory or voluntary reporting by</text>
  <text start="373.66" dur="4.14">either the central bank lenders or the</text>
  <text start="375.97" dur="3.9">bullion bank borrowers the Bank of</text>
  <text start="377.8" dur="4.41">England has a major role in the gold</text>
  <text start="379.87" dur="5.34">lending market as the gold used in</text>
  <text start="382.21" dur="5.28">lending is almost all sourced from the</text>
  <text start="385.21" dur="4.71">central bank custody holding in the Bank</text>
  <text start="387.49" dur="5.22">of England&amp;#39;s vaults there is therefore</text>
  <text start="389.92" dur="5.07">zero informational efficiency in gold</text>
  <text start="392.71" dur="3.84">lending and that&amp;#39;s the way the central</text>
  <text start="394.99" dur="3.12">bankers like it they don&amp;#39;t want anyone</text>
  <text start="396.55" dur="4.02">to know about anything they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="398.11" dur="6.48">anyone to audit them they want everyone</text>
  <text start="400.57" dur="6.93">kept in the dark and if we take this a</text>
  <text start="404.59" dur="5.58">step further even if you ask for a</text>
  <text start="407.5" dur="5.13">Freedom of Information request about</text>
  <text start="410.17" dur="5.22">gold lending they&amp;#39;re always shut down by</text>
  <text start="412.63" dur="5.1">the central banks they will not allow</text>
  <text start="415.39" dur="4.29">this information out they say well this</text>
  <text start="417.73" dur="3.33">is because of national security this is</text>
  <text start="419.68" dur="5.16">why we can&amp;#39;t allow you to have this</text>
  <text start="421.06" dur="6">information Gold is very important in</text>
  <text start="424.84" dur="5.13">the entire system this is why China</text>
  <text start="427.06" dur="6.27">Russia had been amassing a huge amount</text>
  <text start="429.97" dur="6.72">of gold because they&amp;#39;re building that</text>
  <text start="433.33" dur="4.62">system out in the east because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="436.69" dur="4.14">getting ready to move everything from</text>
  <text start="437.95" dur="5.91">the west to the east and this is why</text>
  <text start="440.83" dur="4.74">they spent a very long time keeping the</text>
  <text start="443.86" dur="3.869">gold price I can imagine if they allowed</text>
  <text start="445.57" dur="6.09">the free market to set the price for</text>
  <text start="447.729" dur="5.671">gold it would show the entire world that</text>
  <text start="451.66" dur="6.99">their system</text>
  <text start="453.4" dur="8.37">is a disaster their system does not work</text>
  <text start="458.65" dur="4.5">for the people their system imploded a</text>
  <text start="461.77" dur="5.85">long time ago</text>
  <text start="463.15" dur="7.41">but by controlling everything they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="467.62" dur="5.31">allowed not allowed but they&amp;#39;re able to</text>
  <text start="470.56" dur="5.579">keep everyone in the dark</text>
  <text start="472.93" dur="7.17">and this is what Trump and his</text>
  <text start="476.139" dur="8.881">administration are set out to do to get</text>
  <text start="480.1" dur="8.46">rid of this system Andrew Jackson I said</text>
  <text start="485.02" dur="5.22">there&amp;#39;s so many times he campaigned on</text>
  <text start="488.56" dur="3.419">getting rid of the central bank</text>
  <text start="490.24" dur="4.59">Trump has Andrew Jackson hanging in his</text>
  <text start="491.979" dur="4.771">office there&amp;#39;s a reason for it you just</text>
  <text start="494.83" dur="5.1">don&amp;#39;t hang this individual in your</text>
  <text start="496.75" dur="5.43">office right behind you for no reason</text>
  <text start="499.93" dur="6.12">whatsoever you do it for a specific</text>
  <text start="502.18" dur="6.78">reason because that is exactly what his</text>
  <text start="506.05" dur="4.2">mission is not just his mission and I</text>
  <text start="508.96" dur="3.709">don&amp;#39;t want everyone to think that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="510.25" dur="5.37">just Trump there are many individuals</text>
  <text start="512.669" dur="6.641">Patriots that are behind him that are</text>
  <text start="515.62" dur="6.33">orchestrating and pushing out rogue</text>
  <text start="519.31" dur="4.89">elements within our government that were</text>
  <text start="521.95" dur="6.95">never supposed to be there which took</text>
  <text start="524.2" dur="7.53">control and manipulated everything and</text>
  <text start="528.9" dur="5.5">basically kept the truth from us for a</text>
  <text start="531.73" dur="6.54">very long time so Trump right now is</text>
  <text start="534.4" dur="7.05">pushing tariffs pushing Germany pushing</text>
  <text start="538.27" dur="7.71">the EU pushing the central banks and his</text>
  <text start="541.45" dur="7.829">targets are all these organizations he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="545.98" dur="6.89">dismantling everything right now he has</text>
  <text start="549.279" dur="5.641">put the global economic system on notice</text>
  <text start="552.87" dur="4.839">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening right now now</text>
  <text start="554.92" dur="5.97">who is very nervous about this the</text>
  <text start="557.709" dur="6.541">central bankers they&amp;#39;re nervous all</text>
  <text start="560.89" dur="6.6">those individuals that have built the</text>
  <text start="564.25" dur="5.1">system over the many many years they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="567.49" dur="4.469">nervous it&amp;#39;s going to be taken away and</text>
  <text start="569.35" dur="6.84">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that this</text>
  <text start="571.959" dur="6.991">system is basically dying actually it</text>
  <text start="576.19" dur="4.07">has died but the central banker is by</text>
  <text start="578.95" dur="3.87">putting the World Trade Organization</text>
  <text start="580.26" dur="4.48">NAFTA while they wanted TPP but they</text>
  <text start="582.82" dur="3.57">couldn&amp;#39;t get it and everything else into</text>
  <text start="584.74" dur="2.46">place they&amp;#39;re able to keep the illusion</text>
  <text start="586.39" dur="2.55">alive but</text>
  <text start="587.2" dur="3.51">when you start to break all these down</text>
  <text start="588.94" dur="3.99">and you start to remove each one of them</text>
  <text start="590.71" dur="5.96">and you just mantle it the illusion</text>
  <text start="592.93" dur="7.62">starts to break away the illusion</text>
  <text start="596.67" dur="6.61">disappears the truth then comes out you</text>
  <text start="600.55" dur="5.07">see the real picture of what the economy</text>
  <text start="603.28" dur="3.6">is really made of and when people start</text>
  <text start="605.62" dur="2.85">to see this and people start to</text>
  <text start="606.88" dur="2.81">recognize this and they start to realize</text>
  <text start="608.47" dur="4.41">well wait a minute</text>
  <text start="609.69" dur="6.97">the Fiat system the Fiat system it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="612.88" dur="6.24">destroyed I mean this this is fake the</text>
  <text start="616.66" dur="5.49">dollar is absolutely worth nothing</text>
  <text start="619.12" dur="5.88">because in a free market the gold price</text>
  <text start="622.15" dur="5.07">is what and we don&amp;#39;t know what that is</text>
  <text start="625" dur="5.09">really it could be ten thousand an ounce</text>
  <text start="627.22" dur="6.6">it could be twenty thousand an ounce</text>
  <text start="630.09" dur="8.41">this is what&amp;#39;s going to happen it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="633.82" dur="6.87">if but when the clock is ticking down</text>
  <text start="638.5" dur="3.84">and we&amp;#39;re heading towards that level and</text>
  <text start="640.69" dur="3.69">we have been seeing indicator after</text>
  <text start="642.34" dur="3.9">indicator after indicator that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="644.38" dur="3.84">huge amount of problems in this economy</text>
  <text start="646.24" dur="4.62">and I&amp;#39;m not talking about the stock</text>
  <text start="648.22" dur="4.02">market and all the fake statistical</text>
  <text start="650.86" dur="4.02">numbers if the government puts out the</text>
  <text start="652.24" dur="4.32">Fed follows and lies about because they</text>
  <text start="654.88" dur="3.78">told us a lie back in 2008</text>
  <text start="656.56" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;re not forecasting recession at any</text>
  <text start="658.66" dur="3.75">time everything&amp;#39;s perfect everything was</text>
  <text start="660.25" dur="4.17">contained don&amp;#39;t worry about it</text>
  <text start="662.41" dur="3.84">we got everything under control oh and</text>
  <text start="664.42" dur="3.48">by the way once this whole thing</text>
  <text start="666.25" dur="3.81">disappears and the whole thing implodes</text>
  <text start="667.9" dur="4.08">we&amp;#39;re gonna steal everything you have</text>
  <text start="670.06" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s what they do I mean let&amp;#39;s look at</text>
  <text start="671.98" dur="4.38">another indicator right now if we look</text>
  <text start="673.96" dur="6.15">at US corporate debt levels they stand</text>
  <text start="676.36" dur="5.34">above crisis highs even as default rates</text>
  <text start="680.11" dur="6.06">among the most leveraged firms remain</text>
  <text start="681.7" dur="7.2">subdued now let&amp;#39;s go back to 2007-2008</text>
  <text start="686.17" dur="6.42">around that time period and we look at</text>
  <text start="688.9" dur="9.71">the debt level well we see the debt</text>
  <text start="692.59" dur="9.57">level at around 46% today it&amp;#39;s around</text>
  <text start="698.61" dur="6.4">47% we&amp;#39;re way above there but if we look</text>
