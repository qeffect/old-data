  <text start="74.17" dur="3.39">we&amp;#39;re seeing chaos in the market and we</text>
  <text start="75.82" dur="4.68">have to remember the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="77.56" dur="5.64">they push in there free money into the</text>
  <text start="80.5" dur="4.32">market to prop it up this is a</text>
  <text start="83.2" dur="3.69">manipulated market because if you look</text>
  <text start="84.82" dur="3.6">at all the corporations the sales the</text>
  <text start="86.89" dur="4.08">revenue the profits everything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="88.42" dur="4.92">going on does not support what the</text>
  <text start="90.97" dur="3.72">market is doing right now even with</text>
  <text start="93.34" dur="3.75">Trump saying that he&amp;#39;s bringing back</text>
  <text start="94.69" dur="5.28">jobs bringing back manufacturing jobs</text>
  <text start="97.09" dur="4.71">it still doesn&amp;#39;t support the market</text>
  <text start="99.97" dur="4.35">being at 20,000 points just like it</text>
  <text start="101.8" dur="5.34">didn&amp;#39;t support the market back in 2008</text>
  <text start="104.32" dur="4.71">when I was around 14,000 points and all</text>
  <text start="107.14" dur="5.4">of a sudden it just came crashing down</text>
  <text start="109.03" dur="6.15">but what we&amp;#39;re seeing leading up to the</text>
  <text start="112.54" dur="5.94">market coming down is that behind the</text>
  <text start="115.18" dur="5.61">scenes behind this gauge that the Fed</text>
  <text start="118.48" dur="5.64">uses and a lot of individuals used to</text>
  <text start="120.79" dur="5.36">gauge how the economy is doing we can</text>
  <text start="124.12" dur="4.44">see behind the scenes that things are</text>
  <text start="126.15" dur="3.969">rapidly deteriorating and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="128.56" dur="3.24">looking at many different economic</text>
  <text start="130.119" dur="4.231">indicators and we&amp;#39;ve been tracking them</text>
  <text start="131.8" dur="6.54">day after day week after week year after</text>
  <text start="134.35" dur="7.889">year to show how the Fed how a central</text>
  <text start="138.34" dur="6.39">banker pumps up a market makes everyone</text>
  <text start="142.239" dur="4.321">believe that we&amp;#39;re in a recovery makes</text>
  <text start="144.73" dur="4.47">everyone believe that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="146.56" dur="5.55">makes everyone believe that they fix the</text>
  <text start="149.2" dur="5.4">problem and we&amp;#39;re going to track how</text>
  <text start="152.11" dur="5.49">they bring it down and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="154.6" dur="4.26">show how long it takes and everyone out</text>
  <text start="157.6" dur="3.18">there saying well I haven&amp;#39;t seen a</text>
  <text start="158.86" dur="4.29">collapse yet what are you going to say</text>
  <text start="160.78" dur="5.429">when the collapse hit because the same</text>
  <text start="163.15" dur="6.51">exact people back in 2006 the same</text>
  <text start="166.209" dur="4.951">people in 2007 who said hey all you</text>
  <text start="169.66" dur="2.52">people saying that the credit market is</text>
  <text start="171.16" dur="2.76">going to freeze up and the real estate</text>
  <text start="172.18" dur="3.57">market is going to crash I haven&amp;#39;t seen</text>
  <text start="173.92" dur="4.679">it yet and all of a sudden it crashed in</text>
  <text start="175.75" dur="6.09">2008 well all those people scurried away</text>
  <text start="178.599" dur="5.881">and we never heard from them again until</text>
  <text start="181.84" dur="7.17">now but the whole point of this is to</text>
  <text start="184.48" dur="6.869">show everyone how central bankers how</text>
  <text start="189.01" dur="4.589">they pump it up and while they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="191.349" dur="4.771">pumping it up how the economy in the</text>
  <text start="193.599" dur="5.28">background deteriorates and falls apart</text>
  <text start="196.12" dur="5.64">until we get to that point where the</text>
  <text start="198.879" dur="5.19">system comes down and then we show what</text>
  <text start="201.76" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re going to do as the system comes</text>
  <text start="204.069" dur="5.25">down how bad it&amp;#39;s going to get and what</text>
  <text start="207.22" dur="4.44">they need to do to pump it back up again</text>
  <text start="209.319" dur="4.351">and how they look like heroes when they</text>
  <text start="211.66" dur="5.13">say don&amp;#39;t worry we&amp;#39;re going to step in</text>
  <text start="213.67" dur="5.55">with QE that&amp;#39;s what this is all about</text>
  <text start="216.79" dur="5.16">and we&amp;#39;ve been tracking this and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="219.22" dur="5.849">been seeing the economy fall apart</text>
  <text start="221.95" dur="4.95">quicker and quicker as we approach the</text>
  <text start="225.069" dur="4.051">point in time when the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="226.9" dur="4.229">going to come down I mean we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="229.12" dur="4.05">looking at manipulated data we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="231.129" dur="4.92">looking at manipulated information and</text>
  <text start="233.17" dur="5.31">we know it&amp;#39;s manipulated because when we</text>
  <text start="236.049" dur="4.681">put the entire puzzle together we can</text>
  <text start="238.48" dur="4.77">see it makes no sense whatsoever I mean</text>
  <text start="240.73" dur="5.19">think about it prior to Trump being</text>
  <text start="243.25" dur="4.739">elected initial jobless claims well that</text>
  <text start="245.92" dur="6.78">has just kept on falling falling falling</text>
  <text start="247.989" dur="8.31">falling into like 1973 lows while retail</text>
  <text start="252.7" dur="5.43">stores were closing left and right the</text>
  <text start="256.299" dur="3.901">restaurant Performance Index was</text>
  <text start="258.13" dur="2.789">dropping at the same time traffic was</text>
  <text start="260.2" dur="4.439">drying up</text>
  <text start="260.919" dur="7.021">we&amp;#39;re traffic to home sales well the</text>
  <text start="264.639" dur="6.9">home sales were we&amp;#39;re drying up mortgage</text>
  <text start="267.94" dur="5.099">applications were declining mortgage</text>
  <text start="271.539" dur="9.211">rates were moving up</text>
  <text start="273.039" dur="11.1">GDP went from 2% to 1.8% to 0.9% and</text>
  <text start="280.75" dur="5.55">that is a manipulated number and when we</text>
  <text start="284.139" dur="4.471">look at all this we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="286.3" dur="5.01">how they do it we want to understand</text>
  <text start="288.61" dur="3.929">what they do a lot of people this is</text>
  <text start="291.31" dur="2.91">going to be a big surprise to them</text>
  <text start="292.539" dur="2.761">they&amp;#39;re going to wake up one morning and</text>
  <text start="294.22" dur="3.75">say wait a minute the market just came</text>
  <text start="295.3" dur="4.77">down just like in 2008 people thought</text>
  <text start="297.97" dur="3.39">everything was fine and then all of a</text>
  <text start="300.07" dur="4.56">sudden everything just came crashing</text>
  <text start="301.36" dur="4.95">down people that I know that had one two</text>
  <text start="304.63" dur="3.93">three four homes that they were renting</text>
  <text start="306.31" dur="4.44">out to they purchased it came to an end</text>
  <text start="308.56" dur="4.77">they couldn&amp;#39;t support those anymore</text>
  <text start="310.75" dur="4.98">because they were riding the gravy train</text>
  <text start="313.33" dur="4.41">and it all came to a screeching halt</text>
  <text start="315.73" dur="4.56">the same thing is going to happen now</text>
  <text start="317.74" dur="4.74">but it&amp;#39;s going to be much worse we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="320.29" dur="5.46">already seeing the initial jobless</text>
  <text start="322.48" dur="7.05">claims well they were unchanged since</text>
  <text start="325.75" dur="9.33">February of 2016 and after today they</text>
  <text start="329.53" dur="8.4">moved up 18,000 unemployment claims so</text>
  <text start="335.08" dur="5.28">the last three weeks have seen a 15%</text>
  <text start="337.93" dur="4.95">surge in claims this is the biggest</text>
  <text start="340.36" dur="5.64">spike since May 2016 now what happened</text>
  <text start="342.88" dur="4.77">here did anything change well yeah the</text>
  <text start="346" dur="3.15">economy is getting worse it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="347.65" dur="3.06">been getting worse we&amp;#39;ve been seeing the</text>
  <text start="349.15" dur="4.05">decline in the economy for quite a while</text>
  <text start="350.71" dur="3.57">what about all these jobs coming back I</text>
  <text start="353.2" dur="3.57">guess not</text>
  <text start="354.28" dur="4.53">what&amp;#39;s happening is the manipulation is</text>
  <text start="356.77" dur="3.89">starting to unravel right now and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="358.81" dur="4.41">starting to see the real economic</text>
  <text start="360.66" dur="5.29">indicators come through we talked about</text>
  <text start="363.22" dur="4.2">the art bubble a couple reports back and</text>
  <text start="365.95" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;re seeing that this is worsening</text>
  <text start="367.42" dur="3.96">right now over just the past couple of</text>
  <text start="369.58" dur="3.75">days there have been a litany of</text>
  <text start="371.38" dur="4.41">negative economic data points including</text>
  <text start="373.33" dur="4.23">the crashing bank loan creation the</text>
  <text start="375.79" dur="4.02">surgeon auto loan delinquencies</text>
  <text start="377.56" dur="7.08">continuous deterioration on the retail</text>
  <text start="379.81" dur="7.17">sector the recalculation of GDP and we</text>
  <text start="384.64" dur="4.47">can see that well the mega wealthy folks</text>
  <text start="386.98" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re really not affected by this they</text>
  <text start="389.11" dur="5.88">can skim by all of this but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="392.29" dur="4.92">seeing right now is that the money their</text>
  <text start="394.99" dur="4.38">their large sums of money that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="397.21" dur="4.23">been putting into art but that is now</text>
  <text start="399.37" dur="4.89">effective because what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="401.44" dur="4.59">that suddenly the wealthy while they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="404.26" dur="3.9">taking a breather from purchasing</text>
  <text start="406.03" dur="4.8">multi-million dollar works of fine art</text>
  <text start="408.16" dur="6.72">which have collapsed to the levels not</text>
  <text start="410.83" dur="6.33">recorded since 2009 sales of art and</text>
  <text start="414.88" dur="4.16">antique antiques dropped around 11</text>
  <text start="417.16" dur="4.47">percent to about 50 6.6 billion</text>
  <text start="419.04" dur="3.61">according to a report released on</text>
  <text start="421.63" dur="5.01">Wednesday by UBS</text>
  <text start="422.65" dur="6.89">the decline on top of a 7% slide in 2015</text>
  <text start="426.64" dur="6.72">wipes out the gains seen in 2013 2014</text>
  <text start="429.54" dur="6.73">when sales reached an all-time high of</text>
  <text start="433.36" dur="5.28">68 point 2 billion and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="436.27" dur="5.94">see that this is getting worse auction</text>
  <text start="438.64" dur="5.76">sales declined by 26% sales of post-war</text>
  <text start="442.21" dur="5.43">and contemporary works at auction fell</text>
  <text start="444.4" dur="4.86">18% the high end of the auction market</text>
  <text start="447.64" dur="5.34">where prices for artwork</text>
  <text start="449.26" dur="5.55">see did 1 million fell 34% trophies</text>
  <text start="452.98" dur="5.49">priced at more than 10 million so the</text>
  <text start="454.81" dur="7.44">biggest decline 53% the art bubble is</text>
  <text start="458.47" dur="4.92">popping now the real estate market we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="462.25" dur="4.56">been talking about this for quite a</text>
  <text start="463.39" dur="5.04">while and where we&amp;#39;re seeing that even</text>
  <text start="466.81" dur="3.75">though they&amp;#39;re trying to keep the bubble</text>
  <text start="468.43" dur="4.53">inflated and this is how the central</text>
  <text start="470.56" dur="3.54">bankers work the system they inflate the</text>
  <text start="472.96" dur="3.78">real estate bubble the real estate</text>
  <text start="474.1" dur="6.33">bubble has links into the entire economy</text>
  <text start="476.74" dur="5.67">and they need this bubble blown up and</text>
  <text start="480.43" dur="4.29">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all of</text>
  <text start="482.41" dur="5.43">this is that we have pending home sales</text>
  <text start="484.72" dur="6">decline we have existing home sales</text>
  <text start="487.84" dur="4.71">declining we have mortgage applications</text>
  <text start="490.72" dur="5.61">to climbing we have mortgage rates</text>
  <text start="492.55" dur="6.15">moving up but new home sales they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="496.33" dur="4.95">increasing that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="498.7" dur="5.58">something&amp;#39;s wrong someone&amp;#39;s lying once</text>
  <text start="501.28" dur="6.18">again and it looks like they play with</text>
  <text start="504.28" dur="5.67">this economic data to convince you that</text>
  <text start="507.46" dur="4.86">things are going well we know that</text>
  <text start="509.95" dur="6.09">construction is declining</text>
  <text start="512.32" dur="6.06">we know that Toll Brothers Lennar all of</text>
  <text start="516.04" dur="5.85">them have been been seeing a decrease in</text>
  <text start="518.38" dur="4.71">foot traffic so when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="521.89" dur="4.11">can see that everything else is</text>
  <text start="523.09" dur="4.95">declining except new home sales which</text>
  <text start="526" dur="4.71">doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense whatsoever</text>
  <text start="528.04" dur="5.19">and if we really look at it new home</text>
  <text start="530.71" dur="4.2">sales declined recently and it looks</text>
  <text start="533.23" dur="3.42">like all they do is they keep bobbing</text>
  <text start="534.91" dur="3.6">the numbers up and down but when we look</text>
  <text start="536.65" dur="4.67">at the hard data when we look at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="538.51" dur="6.78">really going on we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="541.32" dur="6.34">no way possibly true just like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="545.29" dur="4.23">telling us that retail is declining</text>
  <text start="547.66" dur="4.44">because of online sales and online sales</text>
  <text start="549.52" dur="5.43">is only one tenth of retail it makes no</text>
  <text start="552.1" dur="4.83">sense but what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the</text>
  <text start="554.95" dur="4.56">home ownership rate in the United States</text>
  <text start="556.93" dur="4.98">economy currently stands at one of the</text>
  <text start="559.51" dur="4.65">lowest level since the 1960s</text>
  <text start="561.91" dur="4.23">it will continue to decline pushing us</text>
  <text start="564.16" dur="4.26">closer to this collapse scenario</text>
  <text start="566.14" dur="4.86">according to a survey published by the</text>
  <text start="568.42" dur="4.92">Employee Benefit Research Institute 6 in</text>

  <text start="614.18" dur="4.26">actually they said there were no bubbles</text>
  <text start="615.71" dur="3.84">back in 2008 also actually they told us</text>
