  <text start="235.51" dur="6.12">wait any longer</text>
  <text start="236.17" dur="8.55">now here in the US the US MCA is the</text>
  <text start="241.63" dur="3.829">starting point for the new economic</text>
  <text start="244.72" dur="5.4">system</text>
  <text start="245.459" dur="7.151">why did Trump start with NAFTA now he</text>
  <text start="250.12" dur="5.25">really wanted to scrap it but it was all</text>
  <text start="252.61" dur="4.71">tied up in Congress and Congress as you</text>
  <text start="255.37" dur="7.17">can see they were they weren&amp;#39;t going to</text>
  <text start="257.32" dur="7.47">do anything the u.s. MCA establishes an</text>
  <text start="262.54" dur="6.33">internal north america manufacturing</text>
  <text start="264.79" dur="6.75">system this provides the alternative for</text>
  <text start="268.87" dur="5.37">Asian manufacturing of goods for the US</text>
  <text start="271.54" dur="7.83">market think about why he wants to do</text>
  <text start="274.24" dur="8.16">this he wants to do this because Trump</text>
  <text start="279.37" dur="6.24">the Patriots they know that once the</text>
  <text start="282.4" dur="6.75">central bank system implode the United</text>
  <text start="285.61" dur="6.809">States needs to manufacture it needs to</text>
  <text start="289.15" dur="5.81">trade because it can&amp;#39;t rely on the</text>
  <text start="292.419" dur="6.231">petrodollar anymore</text>
  <text start="294.96" dur="7.549">this manufacturing system is why Mexico</text>
  <text start="298.65" dur="5.94">is all in to support the US us MCA</text>
  <text start="302.509" dur="4.301">additionally the economic benefits</text>
  <text start="304.59" dur="4.74">within the system are constructed is</text>
  <text start="306.81" dur="5.1">exactly what Mexican president is</text>
  <text start="309.33" dur="5.1">willing to pressure House Democrats to</text>
  <text start="311.91" dur="5.7">ratify and also backup Trump on other</text>
  <text start="314.43" dur="5.549">geopolitical issues we know that Nancy</text>
  <text start="317.61" dur="5.58">Pelosi is going to do everything she can</text>
  <text start="319.979" dur="7.021">to make sure that the u.s. MCA does not</text>
  <text start="323.19" dur="7.08">pass how will she back up her claim of</text>
  <text start="327" dur="6.18">why the u.s. MCA is not good for the US</text>
  <text start="330.27" dur="5.85">and that there are labor issues while</text>
  <text start="333.18" dur="5.489">they do what they always do they bring</text>
  <text start="336.12" dur="6.15">in another party that will agree with</text>
  <text start="338.669" dur="5.611">them to show that they are right it</text>
  <text start="342.27" dur="5.07">doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re right they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="344.28" dur="6.78">setting it up so what did she do she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="347.34" dur="7.109">leveraged the afl-cio union president</text>
  <text start="351.06" dur="7.169">richer Richard Trumka to support her</text>
  <text start="354.449" dur="5.28">false claims trumka is trying to help</text>
  <text start="358.229" dur="3.961">the Democrats politically by agreeing</text>
  <text start="359.729" dur="5.731">with the false narrative about the labor</text>
  <text start="362.19" dur="6.78">concerns this is just like the fake</text>
  <text start="365.46" dur="5.67">impeachment the deep state players they</text>
  <text start="368.97" dur="6">will try to stop Trump in the Patriots</text>
  <text start="371.13" dur="7.77">at every turn this has already failed</text>
  <text start="374.97" dur="6.54">the Patriots hold all the cards now this</text>
  <text start="378.9" dur="5.6">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the deep state players</text>
  <text start="381.51" dur="6.18">the central bank they just give up no</text>
  <text start="384.5" dur="5.94">they keep fighting to the end they keep</text>
  <text start="387.69" dur="6.93">pushing their lives until the end and</text>
  <text start="390.44" dur="6.849">it&amp;#39;s just not going to work because on</text>
  <text start="394.62" dur="6.51">the Patriots side they&amp;#39;re gonna show</text>
  <text start="397.289" dur="7.681">real facts evidence of why what Pelosi</text>
  <text start="401.13" dur="5.4">is saying is not true and people are</text>
  <text start="404.97" dur="3.84">gonna comb through this people gonna</text>
  <text start="406.53" dur="4.109">look at it and people gonna say yeah you</text>
  <text start="408.81" dur="4.829">know what it isn&amp;#39;t true</text>
  <text start="410.639" dur="6.06">actually it was NAFTA that was the</text>
  <text start="413.639" dur="5.821">problem not the u.s. MCA and I believe</text>
  <text start="416.699" dur="5.19">the u.s. MCA is just the starting point</text>
  <text start="419.46" dur="6.509">I think eventually he&amp;#39;s gonna tear this</text>
  <text start="421.889" dur="6.231">down and recreate the entire thing now</text>
  <text start="425.969" dur="4.431">very interestingly</text>
  <text start="428.12" dur="4.799">we know that phase 1 of the China deal</text>
  <text start="430.4" dur="5.61">that is going to be signed and now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="432.919" dur="6.691">come to learn that the intellectual</text>
  <text start="436.01" dur="7.47">property agreement between the US and</text>
  <text start="439.61" dur="7.5">China well it looks like they have</text>
  <text start="443.48" dur="6.78">agreed that they&amp;#39;ve already established</text>
  <text start="447.11" dur="4.65">the groundwork the new measures</text>
  <text start="450.26" dur="3.69">announced by the vice chairman of</text>
  <text start="451.76" dur="5.34">China&amp;#39;s National Development and Reform</text>
  <text start="453.95" dur="5.91">Commission will set up a punitive system</text>
  <text start="457.1" dur="5.879">of damages for infringement infringement</text>
  <text start="459.86" dur="7.16">on intellectual property they&amp;#39;re due to</text>
  <text start="462.979" dur="6.69">come into force on January 1st 2020 and</text>
  <text start="467.02" dur="9.03">it seems that the White House is saying</text>
  <text start="469.669" dur="9.901">yes we have won again against China and</text>
  <text start="476.05" dur="7.45">they are agreeing to this part of the</text>
  <text start="479.57" dur="6.42">deal and like I said as we move forward</text>
  <text start="483.5" dur="5.82">that tariffs are gonna slowly be removed</text>
  <text start="485.99" dur="6.33">the deal is going to be made and what</text>
  <text start="489.32" dur="5.28">does that mean that means the central</text>
  <text start="492.32" dur="5.49">bank they&amp;#39;re exposed the mainstream</text>
  <text start="494.6" dur="6.09">media is exposed those who are pushing</text>
  <text start="497.81" dur="5.4">the idea that it&amp;#39;s the tariffs that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="500.69" dur="5.87">the problem that&amp;#39;s all going to be</text>
  <text start="503.21" dur="6.42">exposed to be fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="506.56" dur="6.13">remember timing is everything optics are</text>
  <text start="509.63" dur="4.62">very important now it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="512.69" dur="4.469">we got that message from the Dutch</text>
  <text start="514.25" dur="6.87">central bank that if the system</text>
  <text start="517.159" dur="6.771">collapses the gold stock can serve as a</text>
  <text start="521.12" dur="5.88">basis to build everything up again and</text>
  <text start="523.93" dur="4.48">people are out there saying well what do</text>
  <text start="527" dur="3.12">you mean if the system collapses well</text>
  <text start="528.41" dur="3.57">the system is going to collapse it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="530.12" dur="3.18">central bank system Trump with the</text>
  <text start="531.98" dur="2.91">Patriots they know that it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="533.3" dur="4.8">collapse they&amp;#39;re just trying to hold</text>
  <text start="534.89" dur="7.13">this together long enough to create the</text>
  <text start="538.1" dur="6.6">transitional economy and the u.s. MCA is</text>
  <text start="542.02" dur="4.259">something that is absolutely needed</text>
  <text start="544.7" dur="3.96">because we need to become a</text>
  <text start="546.279" dur="5.371">manufacturing powerhouse once again not</text>
  <text start="548.66" dur="7.89">just the United States but North America</text>
  <text start="551.65" dur="6.46">to have trade with other countries but</text>
  <text start="556.55" dur="4.07">it&amp;#39;s very interesting about the Dutch</text>
  <text start="558.11" dur="3.89">central bank they are now moving</text>
  <text start="560.62" dur="3.95">thirty-one purse</text>
  <text start="562" dur="5.97">and of their gold into military</text>
  <text start="564.57" dur="8.47">facilities because they&amp;#39;re very nervous</text>
  <text start="567.97" dur="7.83">in what is coming now think about this</text>
  <text start="573.04" dur="5.91">look at Europe right now look what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="575.8" dur="6.45">happening around the world we know the</text>
  <text start="578.95" dur="6.96">central bank system cannot last yes the</text>
  <text start="582.25" dur="5.04">Patriots are creating a new economy for</text>
  <text start="585.91" dur="3.09">the people they&amp;#39;re gonna make the</text>
  <text start="587.29" dur="4.5">transition a lot easier</text>
  <text start="589" dur="4.95">think about the European nations think</text>
  <text start="591.79" dur="5.28">about the ECB and the rest of the</text>
  <text start="593.95" dur="6.99">countries well they&amp;#39;re gonna have a very</text>
  <text start="597.07" dur="6.15">difficult time and there could be riots</text>
  <text start="600.94" dur="6.29">there could be a lot of things happening</text>
  <text start="603.22" dur="8.07">when a system comes down and we can see</text>
  <text start="607.23" dur="7">why the central bank systems why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="611.29" dur="6.63">going to be placing gold in a fortified</text>
  <text start="614.23" dur="8.55">area and have soldiers protect the gold</text>
  <text start="617.92" dur="7.02">they&amp;#39;re protecting their wealth if you</text>
  <text start="622.78" dur="4.35">notice they&amp;#39;re not putting fiat in a</text>
  <text start="624.94" dur="5.52">military facility they&amp;#39;re putting gold</text>
  <text start="627.13" dur="5.18">in a military facility and we need to</text>
  <text start="630.46" dur="4.77">remember that here in the United States</text>
  <text start="632.31" dur="5.8">there is US legislation which was passed</text>
  <text start="635.23" dur="5.19">in 2015 which allows which allows Texas</text>

  <text start="659.02" dur="9.06">necessary in case the monetary reset</text>
  <text start="663.089" dur="9.371">happens and we see that the central</text>

  <text start="677.74" dur="7.349">how do we know this well Mike Mark</text>
  <text start="681.31" dur="7.32">Carney kind of hinted about this in a</text>
  <text start="685.089" dur="6.991">23-page speech where he speaks of</text>
  <text start="688.63" dur="7.74">creating a synthetic hegemonic currency</text>
