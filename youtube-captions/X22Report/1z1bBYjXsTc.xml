  <text start="50.789" dur="5.04">site let&amp;#39;s get started with the economic</text>
  <text start="53.429" dur="5.461">collapse now we understand that a lot of</text>
  <text start="55.829" dur="5.46">countries a lot of corporations are now</text>
  <text start="58.89" dur="6.419">switching over to the yuan and remember</text>
  <text start="61.289" dur="6.121">and a lot of deals are being made around</text>
  <text start="65.309" dur="4.681">the world with China and Russia at this</text>
  <text start="67.41" dur="6.3">time now Christine Lagarde was out there</text>
  <text start="69.99" dur="7.699">and she is saying that one day the</text>
  <text start="73.71" dur="8.339">headquarters for the IMF may shift from</text>
  <text start="77.689" dur="6.851">Washington to Beijing because of what is</text>
  <text start="82.049" dur="5.521">happening with China with their economy</text>
  <text start="84.54" dur="5.579">spandy expanding and with the yuan and</text>
  <text start="87.57" dur="5.13">remember spreading across the world</text>
  <text start="90.119" dur="4.89">Christine Lagarde speaking late today in</text>
  <text start="92.7" dur="4.739">London said IMF rules require the main</text>
  <text start="95.009" dur="4.89">office to be located in the country that</text>
  <text start="97.439" dur="4.051">is the biggest shareholder which the US</text>
  <text start="99.899" dur="3.18">has been since the fun was formed</text>
  <text start="101.49" dur="3.6">seventy years ago and you have to</text>
  <text start="103.079" dur="8.58">remember there is supposed to be a vote</text>
  <text start="105.09" dur="7.98">and and the United States and 2010 said</text>
  <text start="111.659" dur="3.901">that you know they will allow the</text>
  <text start="113.07" dur="4.95">emerging economies to have a larger vote</text>
  <text start="115.56" dur="4.14">in the IMF and it was supposed to be</text>
  <text start="118.02" dur="3.779">brought up in Congress and they let this</text>
  <text start="119.7" dur="4.739">slide it wasn&amp;#39;t they said it will be</text>
  <text start="121.799" dur="4.291">done later in the year of 2014 and it</text>
  <text start="124.439" dur="4.441">seems like they&amp;#39;re continually stalling</text>
  <text start="126.09" dur="6.06">and we can see why they are because once</text>
  <text start="128.88" dur="5.61">the emerging economies start to get more</text>
  <text start="132.15" dur="4.979">and more power and we see that the</text>
  <text start="134.49" dur="4.85">growing economy of China and the</text>
  <text start="137.129" dur="3.931">strength of the you want and remedy</text>
  <text start="139.34" dur="4.93">continually grow</text>
  <text start="141.06" dur="5.179">across the world and more countries do</text>
  <text start="144.27" dur="5.52">bilateral trades and more corporations</text>
  <text start="146.239" dur="5.801">switch over to their currency we can see</text>
  <text start="149.79" dur="5.19">that the IMF might move their</text>
  <text start="152.04" dur="5.79">headquarters from Washington and move</text>
  <text start="154.98" dur="7.8">them over to Beijing and the United</text>
  <text start="157.83" dur="7.769">States would lose pretty much the voting</text>
  <text start="162.78" dur="7.52">power here in the IMF now we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="165.599" dur="7.17">more instances of where companies</text>
  <text start="170.3" dur="4.6">countries are starting to drop the</text>
  <text start="172.769" dur="4.891">dollar and move into different</text>
  <text start="174.9" dur="4.47">currencies right now gasp rom has signed</text>
  <text start="177.66" dur="3.96">additional agreements for clients to</text>
  <text start="179.37" dur="5.94">switch from the dollar to euros now and</text>
  <text start="181.62" dur="5.31">the rim in be so 9 of 10 consumers had</text>
  <text start="185.31" dur="4.08">agreed to switch to these different</text>
  <text start="186.93" dur="5.04">currencies and they decided to drop the</text>
  <text start="189.39" dur="3.78">dollar at this time Gazprom Neft had</text>
  <text start="191.97" dur="3.239">signed additional agreements with</text>
  <text start="193.17" dur="3.48">consumers and a possible switch from</text>
  <text start="195.209" dur="3.991">dollars to euros for payments under</text>
  <text start="196.65" dur="4.89">contract some contracting parties agree</text>
  <text start="199.2" dur="4.259">to switch from dollars to euros and you</text>
  <text start="201.54" dur="5.1">want at this time so now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="203.459" dur="4.831">balancing both euros and you won and we</text>
  <text start="206.64" dur="3.78">can see when this when this starts to</text>
  <text start="208.29" dur="5.1">happen this is when everyone should</text>
  <text start="210.42" dur="5.28">start to worry because we see the IMF</text>
  <text start="213.39" dur="4.11">Christine Lagarde talking about it we</text>
  <text start="215.7" dur="3.36">see corporations here in the United</text>
  <text start="217.5" dur="3.63">States starting to do it we see</text>
  <text start="219.06" dur="4.47">countries continually making bilateral</text>
  <text start="221.13" dur="4.949">agreements with China there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="223.53" dur="4.5">clearing houses being set up in UK in</text>
  <text start="226.079" dur="4.611">Kenya we see New Zealand Australia</text>
  <text start="228.03" dur="4.859">Canada and many other nations</text>
  <text start="230.69" dur="5.199">continually making these agreements and</text>
  <text start="232.889" dur="5.13">the only nation that&amp;#39;s not is the United</text>
  <text start="235.889" dur="3.93">States now this should worry every</text>
  <text start="238.019" dur="4.291">single person because what this means is</text>
  <text start="239.819" dur="4.771">is that since these countries are no</text>
  <text start="242.31" dur="3.69">longer dealing in the dollar and we see</text>
  <text start="244.59" dur="3.869">what&amp;#39;s happening in the Middle East with</text>
  <text start="246" dur="4.29">the people rising up and taking control</text>
  <text start="248.459" dur="4.021">of their country and pushing the private</text>
  <text start="250.29" dur="4.56">western central bankers out this means</text>
  <text start="252.48" dur="4.409">that these countries and central banks</text>
  <text start="254.85" dur="4.83">of these countries do not have to hold</text>
  <text start="256.889" dur="5.491">the US dollar in reserves since they do</text>
  <text start="259.68" dur="5.88">not have to pay for goods using the US</text>
  <text start="262.38" dur="5.52">dollar and this means that that money is</text>
  <text start="265.56" dur="4.62">going to flood back to the United States</text>
  <text start="267.9" dur="5.31">and as we&amp;#39;re seeing right now we are</text>
  <text start="270.18" dur="4.65">seeing inflation and every time I go to</text>
  <text start="273.21" dur="3.6">the market I sifu</text>
  <text start="274.83" dur="4.26">would continually rising and of course</text>
  <text start="276.81" dur="4.65">the manufacturers are trying to shrink</text>
  <text start="279.09" dur="4.44">the products they&amp;#39;re trying to reel in</text>
  <text start="281.46" dur="4.17">the cost to make it look like nothing</text>
  <text start="283.53" dur="3.93">has been going on but it&amp;#39;s getting out</text>
  <text start="285.63" dur="5.16">of control at this point we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="287.46" dur="5.4">prices start to really rise and this is</text>
  <text start="290.79" dur="3.69">because a lot of these dollars are</text>
  <text start="292.86" dur="3.99">starting to head back to the United</text>
  <text start="294.48" dur="5.67">States it&amp;#39;s starting to flood the market</text>
  <text start="296.85" dur="5.37">and it&amp;#39;s starting to decrease the value</text>
  <text start="300.15" dur="5.13">of the dollar and we&amp;#39;re seeing this</text>
  <text start="302.22" dur="6">happen more and more and what this goes</text>
  <text start="305.28" dur="5.82">on to say that the so-called plan B is</text>
  <text start="308.22" dur="4.89">already partially worked out the switch</text>
  <text start="311.1" dur="4.08">of dollar contracts to yours and you</text>
  <text start="313.11" dur="4.74">want is agreed on with some of our</text>
  <text start="315.18" dur="5.28">contract parties under consideration is</text>
  <text start="317.85" dur="5.97">the possibility to switch contracts to</text>
  <text start="320.46" dur="7.02">rules the more economic sanctions it</text>
  <text start="323.82" dur="5.07">lobs at Russia many of the nation&amp;#39;s are</text>
  <text start="327.48" dur="3.69">looking at this and they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="328.89" dur="4.35">worried about what the United States is</text>
  <text start="331.17" dur="4.23">doing and how the United States economy</text>
  <text start="333.24" dur="4.62">is and more of them are starting to</text>
  <text start="335.4" dur="4.44">switch into other currencies now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="337.86" dur="4.08">said this before we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="339.84" dur="4.38">this very closely slowly every day</text>
  <text start="341.94" dur="4.68">incrementally and it&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="344.22" dur="3.84">happening i think more countries are</text>
  <text start="346.62" dur="3.33">worried about what&amp;#39;s happening here in</text>
  <text start="348.06" dur="6.45">the United States and the sanctions on</text>
  <text start="349.95" dur="7.32">Russia or the sanctions on Iran or Syria</text>
  <text start="354.51" dur="5.16">they see what is going on they are</text>
  <text start="357.27" dur="4.74">losing control in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="359.67" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re losing control in Africa they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="362.01" dur="4.71">losing control in Ukraine and many of</text>
  <text start="364.5" dur="5.34">the nation&amp;#39;s are saying oh something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="366.72" dur="5.1">going on here laws are being passed that</text>
  <text start="369.84" dur="4.62">just don&amp;#39;t seem right they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="371.82" dur="4.86">after everyone&amp;#39;s bank account across the</text>
  <text start="374.46" dur="4.11">world they&amp;#39;re trying to bring in as much</text>
  <text start="376.68" dur="6.45">revenue as they possibly can and</text>
  <text start="378.57" dur="7.2">something is not going the way the</text>
  <text start="383.13" dur="5.01">United States and central bankers want</text>
  <text start="385.77" dur="5.64">it to go and they are definitely losing</text>
  <text start="388.14" dur="6.09">control of the entire situation and this</text>
  <text start="391.41" dur="4.44">is a scary type of scenario because when</text>
  <text start="394.23" dur="3.66">they start to lose control and the plans</text>
  <text start="395.85" dur="4.92">don&amp;#39;t go the way they want they get</text>
  <text start="397.89" dur="6.15">desperate and desperate people do stupid</text>
  <text start="400.77" dur="6.63">things and that stupid thing is the</text>
  <text start="404.04" dur="4.23">event the event that will blame all of</text>
  <text start="407.4" dur="4.35">this on</text>
  <text start="408.27" dur="6.36">another country now we can see the mass</text>
  <text start="411.75" dur="5.19">shootings are really ramping up right</text>
  <text start="414.63" dur="4.74">now if you notice we&amp;#39;re seeing many more</text>
  <text start="416.94" dur="4.86">ramp mass shootings they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="419.37" dur="4.41">happening one after another and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="421.8" dur="4.29">doing this on purpose to try to get</text>
  <text start="423.78" dur="4.62">these gun bills passed the more they</text>
  <text start="426.09" dur="4.98">have the better chance they have in</text>
  <text start="428.4" dur="5.7">passing these gun control bills and of</text>
  <text start="431.07" dur="5.46">course they are pushing other bills</text>
  <text start="434.1" dur="4.11">through they&amp;#39;re trying to get these past</text>
  <text start="436.53" dur="4.53">its course I mentioned this before the</text>
  <text start="438.21" dur="4.65">Dianne Feinstein snitch bill where</text>
  <text start="441.06" dur="4.65">people can tell on other people and</text>
  <text start="442.86" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;ll be investigated they can have a</text>
  <text start="445.71" dur="4.35">court order where they can&amp;#39;t purchase</text>
  <text start="447.42" dur="5.4">weapons and this is how it all begins</text>
  <text start="450.06" dur="5.43">they want people telling on other people</text>
  <text start="452.82" dur="4.8">New York City has that law where if you</text>
  <text start="455.49" dur="5.01">report someone and you think they might</text>
  <text start="457.62" dur="4.74">have a stolen weapon you receive five</text>
  <text start="460.5" dur="3.99">hundred dollars it will start an</text>
  <text start="462.36" dur="3.75">investigation doesn&amp;#39;t mean that they</text>
  <text start="464.49" dur="4.65">don&amp;#39;t need proof at all they just have</text>
  <text start="466.11" dur="5.31">to say I believe and this is a very bad</text>
  <text start="469.14" dur="4.47">thing to start to happen here and with</text>
  <text start="471.42" dur="3.45">this new bill coming in we can see and</text>

  <text start="477" dur="3.78">on your family bill that this could</text>
  <text start="479.01" dur="4.14">cause major major problems like I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="480.78" dur="5.52">said before and we&amp;#39;re going to see these</text>
  <text start="483.15" dur="4.53">mass shootings really ramped up because</text>
  <text start="486.3" dur="4.11">I think they&amp;#39;re in the home stretch</text>
  <text start="487.68" dur="5.67">right now I do believe they&amp;#39;re going to</text>

  <text start="497.28" dur="4.56">really need to bring this home with a</text>
  <text start="498.75" dur="5.16">major major mass shooting and I think</text>
  <text start="501.84" dur="3.78">that is on the way it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="503.91" dur="4.68">horrific they really want to shock</text>
  <text start="505.62" dur="5.34">America at this point to say you see we</text>
  <text start="508.59" dur="5.31">need to get this passed and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="510.96" dur="5.55">laying down the framework bypassing all</text>
  <text start="513.9" dur="5.31">the executive orders with mental illness</text>

  <text start="646.29" dur="3.12">talking about you have to remember</text>
  <text start="647.49" dur="3.24">remember a couple months ago when John</text>
  <text start="649.41" dur="3.15">Kerry was out there saying they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="650.73" dur="4.95">captured this person they have</text>

  <text start="674.91" dur="4.32">later turned out there had never been</text>
  <text start="676.92" dur="5.37">any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq</text>
  <text start="679.23" dur="5.85">you know it&amp;#39;s one thing to say that you</text>
  <text start="682.29" dur="5.67">have evidence and it&amp;#39;s another just to</text>
  <text start="685.08" dur="5.42">show it that you actually do and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="687.96" dur="5.04">absolutely right I noticed these</text>
  <text start="690.5" dur="5.05">government officials continually talk</text>
  <text start="693" dur="4.47">talk talk talk talk of all this evidence</text>
  <text start="695.55" dur="3.93">they were waving around pictures of</text>
  <text start="697.47" dur="5.91">people being gassed during the Syria</text>
  <text start="699.48" dur="6.36">crisis in 2013 but they never gave proof</text>
  <text start="703.38" dur="4.77">all they showed was the after effects</text>
  <text start="705.84" dur="4.5">but they never showed who actually did</text>
  <text start="708.15" dur="5.16">it and later it was proved that it was</text>
  <text start="710.34" dur="4.89">the rebels who did it actually MIT ran</text>
  <text start="713.31" dur="3.36">an experiment and they showed with</text>
  <text start="715.23" dur="5.85">calculations that the Assad government</text>
  <text start="716.67" dur="6.15">could have never fired a missile landing</text>
  <text start="721.08" dur="4.23">in the area that it did it had to come</text>
  <text start="722.82" dur="4.83">from the rebels and of course the whole</text>
  <text start="725.31" dur="4.5">story that the United States England</text>
  <text start="727.65" dur="5.64">France that made they made up completely</text>
  <text start="729.81" dur="4.98">fell apart and here we are today now</text>
  <text start="733.29" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re doing the same exact thing with</text>
  <text start="734.79" dur="4.98">the chlorine weapons they can&amp;#39;t figure</text>
  <text start="737.67" dur="4.41">out how to prove this they have no</text>
  <text start="739.77" dur="4.29">evidence because it really didn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="742.08" dur="3.3">from the serious side it happened from</text>
  <text start="744.06" dur="2.94">the rebel side and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="745.38" dur="3.57">having so many problems and the only</text>
  <text start="747" dur="4.92">thing they can do is show the horrific</text>
  <text start="748.95" dur="5.22">pictures of people coughing people dying</text>
  <text start="751.92" dur="5.85">and they&amp;#39;re trying to move people with</text>
  <text start="754.17" dur="6.9">emotion instead of using real hard facts</text>
  <text start="757.77" dur="5.22">now we understand that Iran their</text>
  <text start="761.07" dur="3.42">interim deal runs out July twentieth</text>
  <text start="762.99" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;re getting very close to that time</text>
  <text start="764.49" dur="5.88">period and now the United States and</text>
  <text start="767.22" dur="5.43">Russia are going into private talks with</text>
  <text start="770.37" dur="4.8">Iran and we have to remember there is a</text>
  <text start="772.65" dur="5.01">document that nobody&amp;#39;s allowed to see</text>
  <text start="775.17" dur="4.32">that only a certain number of people are</text>
  <text start="777.66" dur="3.9">allowed to go in you can&amp;#39;t bring a</text>
  <text start="779.49" dur="4.29">camera phone you can&amp;#39;t go in there make</text>
  <text start="781.56" dur="5.46">copies you can read it you leave it in a</text>
  <text start="783.78" dur="6.23">special room and of course first Iran is</text>
  <text start="787.02" dur="5.58">having some talks with United States</text>
  <text start="790.01" dur="5.71">secretly and then they&amp;#39;re having talks</text>
  <text start="792.6" dur="5.64">with Russia afterwards secretly and this</text>
  <text start="795.72" dur="4.77">must be something about the banking</text>
  <text start="798.24" dur="4.98">system having the central bankers trying</text>
  <text start="800.49" dur="5.1">to get into their banks trying to</text>
  <text start="803.22" dur="4.86">maintain control and to sell their</text>
  <text start="805.59" dur="3.26">natural resources using the US dollar</text>
  <text start="808.08" dur="3.17">and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="808.85" dur="5.159">leave that this is going to go through I</text>
  <text start="811.25" dur="4.38">don&amp;#39;t believe that by this July</text>
  <text start="814.009" dur="4.08">twentieth date that anything will</text>
  <text start="815.63" dur="4.86">actually happen and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="818.089" dur="4.05">maneuver different ways of doing this</text>
  <text start="820.49" dur="5.37">and this whole nuclear talk is a</text>
  <text start="822.139" dur="6.331">complete illusion to cover up the real</text>
  <text start="825.86" dur="5.61">issue and what they really want and we</text>
  <text start="828.47" dur="5.58">cannot forget about Syria and what is</text>
  <text start="831.47" dur="4.95">happening there and you have to remember</text>
  <text start="834.05" dur="5.76">the Turkish government right now has cut</text>
  <text start="836.42" dur="6.149">the flow of freshwater from Euphrates</text>
  <text start="839.81" dur="5.279">River into Syria now we&amp;#39;re seeing people</text>

  <text start="845.089" dur="5.55">stopped and the reservoirs are drying up</text>
  <text start="848.72" dur="4.32">people are going to have a tough time</text>
  <text start="850.639" dur="4.56">surviving the United States is going to</text>
  <text start="853.04" dur="4.14">step in and say look what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="855.199" dur="4.2">there in Syria we have to send in</text>
  <text start="857.18" dur="4.95">humanitarian aid we should allow troops</text>
  <text start="859.399" dur="5.161">to go in there maybe UN troops or NATO</text>
  <text start="862.13" dur="5.759">troops to help out they are trying</text>
  <text start="864.56" dur="5.73">everything they possibly can to get into</text>
  <text start="867.889" dur="4.981">Syria because they understand this is</text>
  <text start="870.29" dur="5.82">the end game there is nothing left for</text>
  <text start="872.87" dur="6.6">them the rebels are losing they are they</text>
  <text start="876.11" dur="7.05">will not stop with trying to get into</text>
  <text start="879.47" dur="7.14">and they&amp;#39;ve been setting up every single</text>
  <text start="883.16" dur="5.97">thing to do some type of huge invasion</text>
  <text start="886.61" dur="6.62">into Syria I mean just look at the facts</text>
  <text start="889.13" dur="7.23">is just undeniable at this time we have</text>
  <text start="893.23" dur="5.039">mastered we have advanced sophisticated</text>
  <text start="896.36" dur="6.029">weapons coming in to Jordan</text>
  <text start="898.269" dur="6.701">anti-aircraft anti-tank weapons they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="902.389" dur="6.241">training thousands upon thousands of</text>
  <text start="904.97" dur="5.91">paid mercenaries in bases in Jordan the</text>
  <text start="908.63" dur="4.29">government already admitted yes we are</text>
  <text start="910.88" dur="5.459">giving more aid to them they have</text>
  <text start="912.92" dur="5.58">already removed the government officials</text>
  <text start="916.339" dur="3.87">within the United States they replaced</text>
  <text start="918.5" dur="4.05">him with the paid mercenary as they</text>
  <text start="920.209" dur="4.23">liaisons to the new government or they</text>
  <text start="922.55" dur="6.479">are going to be the new government they</text>
  <text start="924.439" dur="6.27">have already set up some scenario that</text>
  <text start="929.029" dur="4.23">Assad is still using chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="930.709" dur="4.081">and they&amp;#39;re not allowing the arrest of</text>
  <text start="933.259" dur="4.861">the chemical weapons out of the country</text>
  <text start="934.79" dur="6.82">we can see right now that they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="938.12" dur="7.06">to have private talks with Russia to</text>
  <text start="941.61" dur="6.3">Vince them not to help out Syria if the</text>
  <text start="945.18" dur="5.82">United States decides to invade this is</text>
  <text start="947.91" dur="5.16">what&amp;#39;s going on at this time and the</text>
  <text start="951" dur="5.37">reason all of this is happening is</text>

  <text start="956.37" dur="6.42">into Syria remove Assad and put their</text>
  <text start="959.88" dur="5.01">natural resources on the US dollar and</text>
  <text start="962.79" dur="4.2">then eventually get into Iran because</text>
  <text start="964.89" dur="4.5">this will prop it up for a little while</text>
  <text start="966.99" dur="4.89">longer and if they go into Syria and</text>
  <text start="969.39" dur="5.069">that Russia comes in it looks like the</text>
