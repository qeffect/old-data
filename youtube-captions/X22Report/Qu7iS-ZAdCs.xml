  <text start="62.8" dur="5.49">August 31st 2017 and thought of the</text>
  <text start="65.71" dur="6.12">episode is on strong cycle analysis</text>
  <text start="68.29" dur="5.82">predicts a major event this fall let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="71.83" dur="4.83">get into the economic collapse political</text>
  <text start="74.11" dur="4.62">and geopolitical news now in</text>
  <text start="76.66" dur="5.7">Charlottesville where are coming to</text>
  <text start="78.73" dur="6.36">learn that the governor he had advanced</text>
  <text start="82.36" dur="7.259">notice that something was going to</text>
  <text start="85.09" dur="6.81">happen during the protests DHS actually</text>
  <text start="89.619" dur="3.871">warned because they already knew what</text>
  <text start="91.9" dur="3.6">was going to happen because this was all</text>
  <text start="93.49" dur="3.66">pre-planned this was a false flag they</text>
  <text start="95.5" dur="6.02">already warned the governor that</text>
  <text start="97.15" dur="6.81">something might happen in this town and</text>
  <text start="101.52" dur="6.07">the local authorities they were warned</text>
  <text start="103.96" dur="5.79">and yet allowed it and we can see right</text>
  <text start="107.59" dur="5.9">now they allowed to violence-prone</text>
  <text start="109.75" dur="6.84">parties into a very close proximity to</text>
  <text start="113.49" dur="6.4">the protest and they allowed the events</text>
  <text start="116.59" dur="4.95">to unfold now the warning issued to the</text>
  <text start="119.89" dur="3.75">state and city officials was clear that</text>
  <text start="121.54" dur="5.73">the violence in Charlottesville would</text>
  <text start="123.64" dur="5.22">come and when Trump came out and said</text>
  <text start="127.27" dur="4.92">that you know both sides were</text>
  <text start="128.86" dur="4.62">responsible for what happened we knew</text>
  <text start="132.19" dur="5.01">that the corporate media at that point</text>
  <text start="133.48" dur="5.37">in time well they went crazy and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="137.2" dur="3.63">when they started coming out saying that</text>
  <text start="138.85" dur="4.62">you know whites Trump is with white</text>
  <text start="140.83" dur="5.22">supremacist he&amp;#39;s with Nazis he&amp;#39;s with</text>
  <text start="143.47" dur="4.86">all these groups and he&amp;#39;s not denouncing</text>
  <text start="146.05" dur="4.32">these groups and what he was really</text>
  <text start="148.33" dur="3.78">saying was listen there was a protest</text>
  <text start="150.37" dur="4.05">there were two groups there one did not</text>
  <text start="152.11" dur="4.349">have permits whatsoever they came in and</text>
  <text start="154.42" dur="3.569">they were both sides that were</text>
  <text start="156.459" dur="3.421">responsible they were good people there</text>
  <text start="157.989" dur="4.53">also that were just protesting because</text>
  <text start="159.88" dur="4.47">they had a permit to do so and we can</text>
  <text start="162.519" dur="4.291">see that the governor really has to take</text>
  <text start="164.35" dur="4.109">some responsibility for what happened</text>
  <text start="166.81" dur="3.81">there because they were warned the</text>
  <text start="168.459" dur="4.551">police were held back and the whole</text>
  <text start="170.62" dur="5.25">thing really got blown out of proportion</text>
  <text start="173.01" dur="5.53">because this is what they wanted to</text>
  <text start="175.87" dur="5.91">happen we see the u.s. is releasing</text>
  <text start="178.54" dur="5.52">around 500,000 barrels of oil from the</text>
  <text start="181.78" dur="4.92">strategic reserve and this is because of</text>
  <text start="184.06" dur="4.41">Hurricane Harvey in Texas my</text>
  <text start="186.7" dur="3.899">prayers go out to those individuals that</text>
  <text start="188.47" dur="4.349">got caught up in this storm that might</text>
  <text start="190.599" dur="4.201">have lost their home or maybe lost a</text>
  <text start="192.819" dur="5.191">loved one this is a terrible terrible</text>
  <text start="194.8" dur="5.31">disaster that occurred and the reason</text>
  <text start="198.01" dur="5.55">why the US Energy Department released</text>
  <text start="200.11" dur="6.72">the 500,000 barrels of oil is because</text>
  <text start="203.56" dur="5.55">the port author refinery was shut on</text>
  <text start="206.83" dur="4.86">Wednesday due to flooding from tropical</text>
  <text start="209.11" dur="4.349">storm Harvey and they put out around six</text>
  <text start="211.69" dur="4.079">hundred and three thousand barrels per</text>
  <text start="213.459" dur="4.651">day and basically what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="215.769" dur="3.871">do is you know keep everything stable</text>
  <text start="218.11" dur="4.56">make sure that the fuel prices don&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="219.64" dur="5.78">up and this is why this was released we</text>
  <text start="222.67" dur="6.96">can see that the Pentagon now is</text>
  <text start="225.42" dur="8.319">changing the way they calculate how many</text>
  <text start="229.63" dur="6.51">troops are in each country now what they</text>
  <text start="233.739" dur="5.401">used to do is something completely</text>
  <text start="236.14" dur="6.27">different from what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="239.14" dur="5.79">and basically they used an ambiguous</text>
  <text start="242.41" dur="5.46">metric called force management level</text>
  <text start="244.93" dur="4.529">which was often thousands of troops</text>
  <text start="247.87" dur="4.589">lower than the actual numbers deployed</text>
  <text start="249.459" dur="6.271">and we have to remember they kept a lot</text>
  <text start="252.459" dur="4.471">of temp soldiers in these countries and</text>
  <text start="255.73" dur="3.689">they would rotate them out so they</text>
  <text start="256.93" dur="4.95">wouldn&amp;#39;t really count them at all now</text>
  <text start="259.419" dur="4.951">and these temp soldiers didn&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="261.88" dur="3.99">type of expiration date so if they if</text>
  <text start="264.37" dur="3.78">they have you know to say let&amp;#39;s say ten</text>
  <text start="265.87" dur="4.22">soldiers they we would remove those ten</text>
  <text start="268.15" dur="4.2">soldiers bring in ten soldiers and</text>
  <text start="270.09" dur="3.49">basically you know they&amp;#39;re saying oh</text>
  <text start="272.35" dur="3">these are just rotational they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="273.58" dur="3.36">temporary we don&amp;#39;t have to really count</text>
  <text start="275.35" dur="3.78">them and this has been happening in</text>
  <text start="276.94" dur="5.039">Afghanistan and we come to find out that</text>
  <text start="279.13" dur="5.46">during Obama there wasn&amp;#39;t really 8400</text>
  <text start="281.979" dur="4.771">soldiers there there&amp;#39;s 11 thousand right</text>
  <text start="284.59" dur="3.72">now and we can see throughout the rest</text>
  <text start="286.75" dur="3.99">of the countries and we&amp;#39;ll get to that</text>
  <text start="288.31" dur="4.41">in a second there are a lot more there</text>
  <text start="290.74" dur="3.96">than what they&amp;#39;ve been telling us and</text>
  <text start="292.72" dur="3.03">remember with Iraq they have an</text>
  <text start="294.7" dur="4.23">agreement that there can be about</text>
  <text start="295.75" dur="5.82">something like 4,500 permanent troops in</text>
  <text start="298.93" dur="5.37">Iraq the rest are temporary and they had</text>
  <text start="301.57" dur="4.8">something like 12,000 temporary soldiers</text>
  <text start="304.3" dur="4.08">in Iraq but they never talked about that</text>
  <text start="306.37" dur="4.049">because they didn&amp;#39;t count that they just</text>
  <text start="308.38" dur="4.289">pretended it didn&amp;#39;t exist like almost</text>
  <text start="310.419" dur="3.541">like the debt in government well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="312.669" dur="3.331">not going to count you know the war</text>
  <text start="313.96" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;re not going to count this and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="316" dur="3.09">only going to count that key Majan if</text>
  <text start="317.59" dur="2.67">you did that in the household well I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="319.09" dur="3.66">not going to count those two</text>
  <text start="320.26" dur="4.68">credit-card bills I won&amp;#39;t count my car</text>
  <text start="322.75" dur="4.44">payment so I&amp;#39;m doing pretty darn good</text>
  <text start="324.94" dur="6.3">here because I have very few expenses</text>
  <text start="327.19" dur="6.84">this is what the government does I mean</text>
  <text start="331.24" dur="5.43">they use this fake accounting method to</text>
  <text start="334.03" dur="4.44">count troops they use it to count you</text>
  <text start="336.67" dur="4.53">know what money is coming in and out of</text>
  <text start="338.47" dur="5.19">the government and they want us to be</text>
  <text start="341.2" dur="4.92">honest it&amp;#39;s amazing now Russia is</text>
  <text start="343.66" dur="3.84">pushing back against the US and North</text>
  <text start="346.12" dur="3.48">Korea saying the sanctions are</text>
  <text start="347.5" dur="3.39">completely exhausted and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="349.6" dur="2.43">that this is not going to help the</text>
  <text start="350.89" dur="5.28">situation whatsoever</text>
  <text start="352.03" dur="6.36">and right now China they back sanctions</text>
  <text start="356.17" dur="4.41">by the United States but they want the</text>
  <text start="358.39" dur="3.72">United States they want North Korea they</text>
  <text start="360.58" dur="4.29">want South Korea to come together and</text>
  <text start="362.11" dur="5.13">both stop the provocations between the</text>
  <text start="364.87" dur="5.16">two but this didn&amp;#39;t stop the United</text>
  <text start="367.24" dur="6.9">States the Cabal they are pushing their</text>
  <text start="370.03" dur="6.69">agenda they flew in b1 B&amp;#39;s these are</text>
  <text start="374.14" dur="5.73">Lantz bombers the f-35 s the South</text>
  <text start="376.72" dur="5.58">Korean f-15s they were dropping all</text>
  <text start="379.87" dur="6.96">different type of bombs we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="382.3" dur="6.45">the F the ji bu 32 bombs and we can see</text>
  <text start="386.83" dur="4.71">they were dropping them all over the</text>
  <text start="388.75" dur="4.77">place right on the border of North Korea</text>
  <text start="391.54" dur="4.95">but they were dropping in South Korea to</text>
  <text start="393.52" dur="4.68">send a message to North Korea listen</text>
  <text start="396.49" dur="4.56">don&amp;#39;t try to attack with your missiles</text>
  <text start="398.2" dur="5.37">we will bomb you to the end of the earth</text>
  <text start="401.05" dur="4.53">here and once again North Korea I do not</text>
  <text start="403.57" dur="3.33">believe they&amp;#39;re going to do anything I</text>
  <text start="405.58" dur="3.9">don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re gonna start anything</text>
  <text start="406.9" dur="5.01">but I think will it actually happen is</text>
  <text start="409.48" dur="4.56">the kaabah will set up some typos false</text>
  <text start="411.91" dur="4.11">flag they&amp;#39;ll blame it on North Korea</text>
  <text start="414.04" dur="3.93">just like they blamed North Korea for</text>
  <text start="416.02" dur="3.18">hacking Sony which that never really</text>
  <text start="417.97" dur="4.05">happened it was a disgruntled employee</text>
  <text start="419.2" dur="6.66">but they will make the world believe</text>
  <text start="422.02" dur="6.78">that it was North Korea and they will</text>
  <text start="425.86" dur="3.78">try to push us into war hopefully at</text>
  <text start="428.8" dur="2.94">this point</text>
  <text start="429.64" dur="4.5">China and Russia they have their</text>
  <text start="431.74" dur="4.8">satellites overhead they&amp;#39;re monitoring</text>
  <text start="434.14" dur="3.69">the entire situation and a lot of times</text>
  <text start="436.54" dur="2.46">when the corporate media comes out and</text>
  <text start="437.83" dur="4.29">say oh this was a ballistic missile</text>
  <text start="439" dur="6.27">control can hit Chicago Russia does come</text>
  <text start="442.12" dur="5.73">out and say no this was a medium flight</text>
  <text start="445.27" dur="5.7">type of missile it could not it can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="447.85" dur="4.83">reach Chicago this is not a neo</text>
  <text start="450.97" dur="2.82">continental ballistic missile that can</text>
  <text start="452.68" dur="4.32">fly across to the you know</text>
  <text start="453.79" dur="5.76">states can hit Alaska and they pretty</text>
  <text start="457" dur="5.1">much say no that&amp;#39;s wrong that&amp;#39;s wrong</text>
  <text start="459.55" dur="4.44">and hopefully they&amp;#39;re monitoring the</text>
  <text start="462.1" dur="5.22">entire situation which I think they are</text>
  <text start="463.99" dur="5.07">and if something does happen I think</text>
  <text start="467.32" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re gonna be on top of this to make</text>
  <text start="469.06" dur="4.29">sure that yeah this is fake I mean they</text>
  <text start="471.85" dur="4.05">did this in Syria where they said yeah</text>
  <text start="473.35" dur="4.98">these gas attacks these chemical gas</text>
  <text start="475.9" dur="5.07">attacks by Assad completely fake phony</text>
  <text start="478.33" dur="4.38">and false we see Iran they have restored</text>
  <text start="480.97" dur="4.26">their air service to Russia they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="482.71" dur="5.43">gonna restoring it in September now this</text>
  <text start="485.23" dur="6.3">is after 13 years and now Russia&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="488.14" dur="6.9">be flying planes back into Iraq we see</text>
  <text start="491.53" dur="6.18">that the u.s. is striking back at Russia</text>
  <text start="495.04" dur="4.73">we know that Russia shut down some</text>
  <text start="497.71" dur="4.59">consonants and they sent back some</text>
  <text start="499.77" dur="5.62">diplomats the United States but again we</text>
  <text start="502.3" dur="4.71">have to remember Obama shut down things</text>
  <text start="505.39" dur="4.29">here first the United States because</text>
  <text start="507.01" dur="4.95">they used the idea the propaganda that</text>
  <text start="509.68" dur="3.93">Russia hacked the election and this is</text>
  <text start="511.96" dur="3.389">why they shut it down so the United</text>
  <text start="513.61" dur="4.23">States actually started this they made</text>
  <text start="515.349" dur="4.38">up a false flag event that Russia was</text>
  <text start="517.84" dur="5.31">hacking the elections then they close</text>
  <text start="519.729" dur="5.991">down some consulates then Russia decided</text>
  <text start="523.15" dur="5.73">to close down some consulates and</text>
  <text start="525.72" dur="5.77">basically remove the diplomats from</text>
  <text start="528.88" dur="4.44">Russia now the United States is going</text>
  <text start="531.49" dur="4.59">ahead and saying listen we&amp;#39;re closing</text>
  <text start="533.32" dur="5.82">the san francisco consulate and this is</text>
  <text start="536.08" dur="5.43">a tit for tat but right now the playing</text>
  <text start="539.14" dur="4.38">field is now even we have the same</text>
  <text start="541.51" dur="4.29">number on either side same number of</text>
  <text start="543.52" dur="3.54">consulates and I think this is all the</text>
  <text start="545.8" dur="4.2">United States is gonna do at this point</text>
  <text start="547.06" dur="6.33">but remember the United States used a</text>
  <text start="550" dur="5.88">fake narrative and they made the first</text>
  <text start="553.39" dur="4.44">move and the corporate media is trying</text>
  <text start="555.88" dur="4.53">to blame this on Russia like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="557.83" dur="5.7">actually doing it and Lavrov was out</text>
  <text start="560.41" dur="4.98">there saying that he regrets the</text>
  <text start="563.53" dur="4.29">escalation of tensions he would like to</text>
  <text start="565.39" dur="5.1">meet with Tillerson and it looks like</text>
  <text start="567.82" dur="5.54">he&amp;#39;s going to meet with him later on we</text>
  <text start="570.49" dur="6.57">see that Syria right now they have</text>
  <text start="573.36" dur="4.93">basically taken over the mountain routes</text>
  <text start="577.06" dur="3.15">to dare Azure</text>
  <text start="578.29" dur="4.17">the Islamic state can&amp;#39;t move anything in</text>
  <text start="580.21" dur="5.1">or out and we see that the Syrian army</text>
  <text start="582.46" dur="6.36">the Russian army they are making hue</text>
  <text start="585.31" dur="5.04">huge gains in Syria and we see at this</text>
  <text start="588.82" dur="3.75">point this is exactly what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="590.35" dur="4.38">now we talked about the US troop numbers</text>
  <text start="592.57" dur="4.14">in Iraq and Syria and we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="594.73" dur="3.27">these numbers go up by quite a bit</text>
  <text start="596.71" dur="3.15">because they&amp;#39;re changing the way they</text>
  <text start="598" dur="3.93">count how many troops are there and I</text>
  <text start="599.86" dur="4.77">know they said oh there&amp;#39;s only 350 or</text>
  <text start="601.93" dur="4.17">500 troops in Syria we&amp;#39;re gonna see that</text>
  <text start="604.63" dur="2.79">number go up into the thousands because</text>
  <text start="606.1" dur="3.239">I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of temporary</text>
  <text start="607.42" dur="3.87">troops there which they don&amp;#39;t like to</text>
  <text start="609.339" dur="3.391">count same things gonna happen in Iraq</text>
  <text start="611.29" dur="3.54">and we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on this for a</text>
  <text start="612.73" dur="4.14">very long time and we can see already</text>
  <text start="614.83" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re already changing it to let</text>
  <text start="616.87" dur="5.61">everyone know how many troops are</text>
  <text start="618.76" dur="6.03">actually in these areas Assad was out</text>
  <text start="622.48" dur="5.16">there and he&amp;#39;s saying that the Syrian</text>
  <text start="624.79" dur="6.18">army is victorious and he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="627.64" dur="5.13">all the allies who&amp;#39;ve been funding these</text>
  <text start="630.97" dur="3.869">terrorists these paid mercenaries welp</text>
  <text start="632.77" dur="5.73">and guess what they&amp;#39;re giving up their</text>

  <text start="686.47" dur="7.32">great conflict what is the next great</text>
  <text start="689.86" dur="6.479">conflict well one this might be an</text>
  <text start="693.79" dur="6.54">escalation with North Korea it could</text>
  <text start="696.339" dur="8.221">mean more if there is a false flag event</text>
  <text start="700.33" dur="7.08">and the United States goes into North</text>
  <text start="704.56" dur="5.67">Korea we know that China and Russia</text>
  <text start="707.41" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re not just gonna sit by as the</text>
  <text start="710.23" dur="3.359">United States invades North Korea</text>
  <text start="712.24" dur="3.81">because it brings the United States</text>
  <text start="713.589" dur="4.551">their military assets closer to the</text>
  <text start="716.05" dur="4.16">border of Russia and China and there</text>
  <text start="718.14" dur="3.78">going to let this happen and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="720.21" dur="4.44">going to get involved and this is why</text>
  <text start="721.92" dur="6.21">he&amp;#39;s saying that this might occur we</text>
  <text start="724.65" dur="5.55">also see the economy where the economy</text>
  <text start="728.13" dur="5.25">might implode in the month of September</text>
  <text start="730.2" dur="6.96">and October and he&amp;#39;s saying that we must</text>
  <text start="733.38" dur="6.3">be on guard for this prime period where</text>
  <text start="737.16" dur="5.52">we might get into war the economy might</text>
  <text start="739.68" dur="5.04">implode and what they will do and this</text>
  <text start="742.68" dur="4.98">is what central bankers like to do every</text>
  <text start="744.72" dur="6.15">single time is they like to cover up the</text>
  <text start="747.66" dur="5.76">entire economic collapse and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="750.87" dur="4.47">easy to do with war this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="753.42" dur="5.37">been pushing for war trying to make</text>
  <text start="755.34" dur="5.64">Russia the enemy all along so if we see</text>
  <text start="758.79" dur="3.93">the escalation in North Korea pickup or</text>
  <text start="760.98" dur="3.69">anywhere else and we see some type of</text>
  <text start="762.72" dur="5.49">false flag saying that you know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="764.67" dur="5.79">going in there this is a sign that the</text>
  <text start="768.21" dur="3.54">economy is about to come down at the</text>
  <text start="770.46" dur="3.12">same exact time because what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="771.75" dur="3.75">going to say is that because of the war</text>
  <text start="773.58" dur="4.74">we are all going to have to sacrifice</text>
  <text start="775.5" dur="4.95">and we&amp;#39;re going to go on a wartime</text>
  <text start="778.32" dur="4.44">economy which means they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="780.45" dur="3.57">explain away why you can&amp;#39;t get food on</text>
  <text start="782.76" dur="3.36">the shelves they&amp;#39;re gonna explain away</text>
  <text start="784.02" dur="4.05">why you can&amp;#39;t access your funds in the</text>

  <text start="805.68" dur="3.51">bankers are sitting back funding all of</text>
  <text start="807.48" dur="3.93">this and when everything is said and</text>
  <text start="809.19" dur="4.8">done guess what you need to go back to</text>
  <text start="811.41" dur="5.28">the central bank and borrow the funds to</text>
  <text start="813.99" dur="4.92">rebuild everything and they make a deal</text>
