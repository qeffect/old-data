  <text start="82.29" dur="3.84">collapse financial news now the</text>
  <text start="84.54" dur="2.43">narrative with the central bank is</text>
  <text start="86.13" dur="3">continuing</text>
  <text start="86.97" dur="5.009">we know that Trump has been out there</text>
  <text start="89.13" dur="5.519">and he&amp;#39;s been contradicting the Fed for</text>
  <text start="91.979" dur="6.871">a very long time and now we have Judy</text>
  <text start="94.649" dur="5.161">Shelton this is Trump&amp;#39;s pick he wants</text>
  <text start="98.85" dur="3.81">her to be on the board</text>
  <text start="99.81" dur="6.919">she&amp;#39;s a sound money advocate she likes</text>
  <text start="102.66" dur="7.65">gold and she also would like to</text>
  <text start="106.729" dur="5.051">restructure the Fed now that is very</text>
  <text start="110.31" dur="4.47">interesting because we know that Q has</text>
  <text start="111.78" dur="6.869">told us that structure change is coming</text>
  <text start="114.78" dur="6.24">and we know that things need to change</text>
  <text start="118.649" dur="5.401">we&amp;#39;ll be talking about this in a little</text>
  <text start="121.02" dur="6.12">bit but first Trump and G they are</text>
  <text start="124.05" dur="6.36">sending positive message messages out to</text>
  <text start="127.14" dur="5.81">everyone letting everyone know that that</text>
  <text start="130.41" dur="6.45">phase one part of the deal they both</text>
  <text start="132.95" dur="7.899">want it signed they both want this</text>
  <text start="136.86" dur="7.8">signed and they want to move forward now</text>
  <text start="140.849" dur="6.601">of course this has to be done and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="144.66" dur="5.76">have to see if this takes place but I do</text>
  <text start="147.45" dur="7.44">believe that Trump is not going to give</text>
  <text start="150.42" dur="7.11">on any of the sticking points I believe</text>
  <text start="154.89" dur="6.179">he&amp;#39;s going to say hey this is the way it</text>
  <text start="157.53" dur="5">is tarah stay in place unless we sign</text>
  <text start="161.069" dur="4.611">the deal</text>
  <text start="162.53" dur="7.35">and China right now what are they gonna</text>
  <text start="165.68" dur="6.69">do either they can put it off and Trump</text>
  <text start="169.88" dur="3.72">implements more tariffs which makes it</text>
  <text start="172.37" dur="3.21">better for the United States and worse</text>
  <text start="173.6" dur="3.09">for China because more companies would</text>
  <text start="175.58" dur="2.76">move out of China</text>
  <text start="176.69" dur="3.78">maybe not back to the United States</text>
  <text start="178.34" dur="3.72">maybe some will but they&amp;#39;ll move out</text>
  <text start="180.47" dur="4.62">into other countries which makes it a</text>
  <text start="182.06" dur="5.31">lot more expensive to move back in which</text>
  <text start="185.09" dur="8.04">means they&amp;#39;re not going to move back to</text>
  <text start="187.37" dur="9.96">China and we can see that Trump has this</text>
  <text start="193.13" dur="8.67">time perfectly he knows exactly when to</text>
  <text start="197.33" dur="8.97">have the deal made and he&amp;#39;s allowing</text>
  <text start="201.8" dur="7.32">this time for companies to say hey let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="206.3" dur="5.13">go back to the United States plus he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="209.12" dur="3.27">bringing in billions and billions into</text>
  <text start="211.43" dur="4.08">the United States</text>
  <text start="212.39" dur="4.89">now very interestingly Trump continually</text>
  <text start="215.51" dur="3.15">is out there and he&amp;#39;s letting everyone</text>
  <text start="217.28" dur="3.959">know that he wants the Fed to go to</text>
  <text start="218.66" dur="4.44">negative rates now why does he want the</text>
  <text start="221.239" dur="3.631">Fed to go to negative rates because the</text>
  <text start="223.1" dur="4.02">rest of the world is pretty much a</text>
  <text start="224.87" dur="4.98">negative rates and he says we need to be</text>
  <text start="227.12" dur="4.97">competitive how are we going to be</text>
  <text start="229.85" dur="4.53">competitive if we&amp;#39;re not where they are</text>
  <text start="232.09" dur="3.7">and he&amp;#39;s absolutely right he tweeted out</text>
  <text start="234.38" dur="4.26">the following and this was back in</text>
  <text start="235.79" dur="4.65">September the Federal Reserve should get</text>
  <text start="238.64" dur="3.72">our interest rates down to zero or less</text>
  <text start="240.44" dur="4.59">and we should then start to refinance</text>
  <text start="242.36" dur="4.86">our debt interest cost could be brought</text>
  <text start="245.03" dur="4.32">way down while the same type</text>
  <text start="247.22" dur="4.5">substantially lendeth lengthening the</text>
  <text start="249.35" dur="4.889">term we have the great currency power</text>
  <text start="251.72" dur="4.17">and balance sheet the USA should always</text>
  <text start="254.239" dur="5.521">be paying the lowest rate no inflation</text>
  <text start="255.89" dur="6.029">it is only the naivete of Jay Powell and</text>
  <text start="259.76" dur="3.93">the Federal Reserve that doesn&amp;#39;t allow</text>
  <text start="261.919" dur="4.531">us to do what other countries are</text>
  <text start="263.69" dur="5.28">already doing a once-in-a-lifetime</text>
  <text start="266.45" dur="3.69">opportunity that we&amp;#39;re missing because</text>
  <text start="268.97" dur="7.17">of boneheads</text>
  <text start="270.14" dur="7.8">and those bankers they&amp;#39;re a little bit</text>
  <text start="276.14" dur="4.589">nervous about negative interest rates</text>
  <text start="277.94" dur="5.849">and we know the central banks they need</text>
  <text start="280.729" dur="6.091">to bring the rate below zero if they</text>
  <text start="283.789" dur="4.501">allow the rate to move up to zero or</text>
  <text start="286.82" dur="4.77">above</text>
  <text start="288.29" dur="5.22">the debt implodes they won&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="291.59" dur="3.69">pay for the debt because with the</text>
  <text start="293.51" dur="4.95">interest attached it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="295.28" dur="5.67">impossible now the banks and one of them</text>
  <text start="298.46" dur="3.81">is UBS they&amp;#39;re looking at negative</text>
  <text start="300.95" dur="4.23">interest rates and they send sooner or</text>
  <text start="302.27" dur="6.48">later we&amp;#39;re going to have to pass this</text>
  <text start="305.18" dur="5.43">on to the everyday consumer but don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="308.75" dur="4.59">worry we&amp;#39;re not going to do the middle</text>
  <text start="310.61" dur="5.13">class or the poor we&amp;#39;re only gonna pass</text>
  <text start="313.34" dur="5.52">this to the very wealthy who have their</text>
  <text start="315.74" dur="5.43">bank accounts in our banks and everyone</text>
  <text start="318.86" dur="4.05">else when we&amp;#39;re not gonna pass this on</text>
  <text start="321.17" dur="3.63">to them now think about this for a</text>
  <text start="322.91" dur="4.26">second isn&amp;#39;t this what they told us</text>
  <text start="324.8" dur="4.92">about income tax they said they&amp;#39;re only</text>
  <text start="327.17" dur="4.89">gonna tax the wealthy they&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="329.72" dur="4.26">tax the middle class to the poor they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="332.06" dur="4.85">doing the same thing here now you have</text>
  <text start="333.98" dur="7.56">to remember in a negative rate</text>
  <text start="336.91" dur="8.14">environment you are paying to keep your</text>
  <text start="341.54" dur="5.76">funds in the bank they&amp;#39;re not giving</text>
  <text start="345.05" dur="6.93">anything to you they&amp;#39;re taking it away</text>
  <text start="347.3" dur="7.83">so in reality you&amp;#39;re paying to keep your</text>
  <text start="351.98" dur="6.3">funds in that bank and they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="355.13" dur="6.9">your funds maybe to place into the stock</text>
  <text start="358.28" dur="6.84">market or someplace else to try to build</text>
  <text start="362.03" dur="7.02">up more money it&amp;#39;s not going to you it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="365.12" dur="6.59">going back to into the bank and when we</text>
  <text start="369.05" dur="5.67">really look at this picture here keeping</text>
  <text start="371.71" dur="5.74">the rates in the negative area and high</text>
  <text start="374.72" dur="6.39">and Trump telling the Fed listen we want</text>
  <text start="377.45" dur="6.93">to be at zero or negative doesn&amp;#39;t this</text>
  <text start="381.11" dur="6.36">really destroy the central banking the</text>
  <text start="384.38" dur="5.64">banking system because do you really</text>
  <text start="387.47" dur="4.68">think that they&amp;#39;re only gonna pass this</text>
  <text start="390.02" dur="3.54">along to the wealthy people do you</text>
  <text start="392.15" dur="2.85">really think they&amp;#39;re not gonna end up</text>
  <text start="393.56" dur="5.28">going to the middle class to the poor</text>
  <text start="395" dur="5.97">and why would you keep your money in the</text>
  <text start="398.84" dur="5.91">bank at this point you might as well</text>
  <text start="400.97" dur="7.17">just put it into gold silver or some</text>
  <text start="404.75" dur="7.26">other place the stock market it seems</text>
  <text start="408.14" dur="6.99">like they are pushing the destruction of</text>
  <text start="412.01" dur="6.69">the central bank and the way the banking</text>
  <text start="415.13" dur="5.13">system is today now very interestingly</text>
  <text start="418.7" dur="5.58">we know that</text>
  <text start="420.26" dur="7.29">from wants Judy Shelton to be on the</text>
  <text start="424.28" dur="4.8">board of the Federal Reserve and we</text>
  <text start="427.55" dur="3.93">could see already the mainstream media&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="429.08" dur="3.99">out there and they&amp;#39;re a little bit</text>
  <text start="431.48" dur="2.01">worried about her first of all she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="433.07" dur="3.11">sound</text>
  <text start="433.49" dur="4.92">she likes sound money she likes cold and</text>
  <text start="436.18" dur="5.35">she doesn&amp;#39;t believe the central bank</text>
  <text start="438.41" dur="5.1">should be independent and we know the</text>
  <text start="441.53" dur="4.74">mainstream media deep state central</text>
  <text start="443.51" dur="6.99">bankers they do not like this</text>
  <text start="446.27" dur="7.62">and Judy Shelton she says I don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="450.5" dur="5.46">any reference to independence in the</text>
  <text start="453.89" dur="4.23">legislation that has defined the role of</text>
  <text start="455.96" dur="5.01">the Federal Reserve for the United</text>
  <text start="458.12" dur="5.22">States if people were to read the law</text>
  <text start="460.97" dur="3.48">they would see that it demands at the</text>
  <text start="463.34" dur="3">board of governors of the Federal</text>
  <text start="464.45" dur="4.14">Reserve working hand-in-hand with</text>
  <text start="466.34" dur="4.65">Congress and the president to meet</text>
  <text start="468.59" dur="5.94">certain strategic economic goals for the</text>
  <text start="470.99" dur="5.55">US now we need to remember the deep</text>
  <text start="474.53" dur="4.59">state the central bank this is not the</text>
  <text start="476.54" dur="4.89">direction they want to go they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="479.12" dur="4.86">want to work with the president they</text>
  <text start="481.43" dur="3.93">don&amp;#39;t want to work with Congress they</text>
  <text start="483.98" dur="4.77">want to do whatever they want to do and</text>
  <text start="485.36" dur="8.25">they don&amp;#39;t want inaud it she continued</text>
  <text start="488.75" dur="7.92">that the Fed is by nature a creation of</text>
  <text start="493.61" dur="4.8">Congress adding that if it insists on</text>
  <text start="496.67" dur="4.2">independence it should be more</text>
  <text start="498.41" dur="6.24">transparent about its activities with</text>
  <text start="500.87" dur="5.64">lawmakers it&amp;#39;s in some ways healthier</text>
  <text start="504.65" dur="4.8">that criticism from the White House is</text>
  <text start="506.51" dur="6">out in the open at least we know how the</text>
  <text start="509.45" dur="5.37">president feels the Federal Reserve is</text>
  <text start="512.51" dur="6.9">in promised independence under the</text>
  <text start="514.82" dur="8.4">Constitution right there she&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="519.41" dur="8.4">making the point that we need to change</text>
  <text start="523.22" dur="6.3">the structure of the Federal Reserve why</text>
  <text start="527.81" dur="6.6">is she pushing this narrative out there</text>
  <text start="529.52" dur="7.44">right now because they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="534.41" dur="5.19">control the narrative as we move forward</text>
  <text start="536.96" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re going to make the case of why</text>
  <text start="539.6" dur="6.09">the Federal Reserve should not be</text>
  <text start="542.09" dur="6.93">independent and Trump continually</text>
  <text start="545.69" dur="4.62">pointing the finger at the Fed helps him</text>
  <text start="549.02" dur="3.57">with this</text>
  <text start="550.31" dur="6.18">and of course the mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="552.59" dur="7.17">going to try to counter this and if the</text>
  <text start="556.49" dur="4.89">legislation shows that the Federal</text>
  <text start="559.76" dur="3.68">Reserve needs to be working hand in hand</text>
  <text start="561.38" dur="5.28">with Congress and the president</text>
  <text start="563.44" dur="7.12">it looks like restructuring is coming</text>
  <text start="566.66" dur="7.02">and we need to go back to post 2575 the</text>
  <text start="570.56" dur="5.25">plan to have the Fed raised rates steep</text>
  <text start="573.68" dur="4.05">incline beginning March 2019 in an</text>
  <text start="575.81" dur="3.84">effort to kill the economy prior to 2020</text>
  <text start="577.73" dur="5.49">presidential election is known and</text>
  <text start="579.65" dur="6.45">planned for which they&amp;#39;re already doing</text>
  <text start="583.22" dur="5.91">that first part they stopped it in 2019</text>
  <text start="586.1" dur="5.46">and the Fed started stopped started to</text>
  <text start="589.13" dur="5.82">drop rates they were there cutting rates</text>
  <text start="591.56" dur="8.07">right now the next line says structure</text>
  <text start="594.95" dur="8.73">change coming judy shelton is already</text>
  <text start="599.63" dur="6.39">out there laying the groundwork and if</text>
  <text start="603.68" dur="4.08">we go back to what we said about</text>
  <text start="606.02" dur="4.23">negative interest rates and the banks</text>
  <text start="607.76" dur="5.579">passing this along to the wealthy right</text>

  <text start="635.75" dur="6.81">purpose you think they&amp;#39;re all setting it</text>
  <text start="638.45" dur="6.45">up absolutely why are they setting this</text>
  <text start="642.56" dur="5.279">up because they want to go back to sound</text>

  <text start="858.62" dur="5.1">Trump with Judy Shelton and others that</text>
  <text start="861.74" dur="5.07">he&amp;#39;s going to choose this is the</text>

  <text start="875.48" dur="5.609">Patriots well we&amp;#39;re moving in that</text>
  <text start="878.089" dur="5.311">direction but before we get there we</text>
  <text start="881.089" dur="4.801">know there&amp;#39;s a lot more work to do to</text>
  <text start="883.4" dur="4.92">undo everything the globalists the</text>
  <text start="885.89" dur="4.74">central bank has done over the many many</text>
  <text start="888.32" dur="5.46">years and trump of the Patriots they</text>
  <text start="890.63" dur="6.24">need time to do this and they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="893.78" dur="7.26">at an accelerated pace but I do believe</text>
  <text start="896.87" dur="6.33">it will get done and we will see Judy</text>
  <text start="901.04" dur="3.75">Shelton Trump and others and if it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="903.2" dur="3.6">Judy Shelton and it&amp;#39;s gonna be someone</text>
  <text start="904.79" dur="4.56">else we know they&amp;#39;re gonna try to stop</text>
  <text start="906.8" dur="3.84">every single person that trump is gonna</text>
  <text start="909.35" dur="3.179">try to put on the Federal Reserve Board</text>
  <text start="910.64" dur="3.389">because once they real</text>
  <text start="912.529" dur="5.461">why&amp;#39;s that this person likes sound money</text>
  <text start="914.029" dur="5.211">this person likes gold they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="917.99" dur="4.23">believe the Fed should be independent</text>
  <text start="919.24" dur="4.779">they will try to stop this but once</text>
  <text start="922.22" dur="3.96">again as the Patriots gain more and more</text>
  <text start="924.019" dur="3.961">control this will become more and more</text>
  <text start="926.18" dur="5.06">difficult and I think this is why Trump</text>
  <text start="927.98" dur="7.079">is waiting for the right moment to</text>
  <text start="931.24" dur="5.19">present Judy Shelton and say ok let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="935.059" dur="3.84">move on this</text>
