  <text start="213.69" dur="4.89">elections coming up on March seventeenth</text>
  <text start="216.14" dur="4.45">here in the United States what do we say</text>
  <text start="218.58" dur="3.87">well we see the US government the</text>
  <text start="220.59" dur="4.32">central bankers trying to convince us</text>
  <text start="222.45" dur="4.59">that the unemployment rate has gone down</text>
  <text start="224.91" dur="7.44">to five point five percent and we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="227.04" dur="6.419">a recovery everybody is working the BLS</text>
  <text start="232.35" dur="3.99">reported that the labor force</text>
  <text start="233.459" dur="5.641">participation rate fell and the number</text>
  <text start="236.34" dur="4.65">of people not in the labor force rose by</text>
  <text start="239.1" dur="4.44">three hundred and fifty-four thousand in</text>
  <text start="240.99" dur="5.1">other words the unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="243.54" dur="4.2">dropped because the labor force shrunk I</text>
  <text start="246.09" dur="4.59">mean think about what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="247.74" dur="5.82">tell us here if the economy was really</text>
  <text start="250.68" dur="4.32">in a recovery the labor force would be</text>
  <text start="253.56" dur="4.35">growing and the labor force</text>
  <text start="255" dur="7.29">participation rate would be rising at</text>
  <text start="257.91" dur="7.71">this time the 295,000 claimed new jobs</text>
  <text start="262.29" dur="4.89">are highly suspect at this time the</text>
  <text start="265.62" dur="5.99">report claims the</text>
  <text start="267.18" dur="9.09">thirty-two thousand jobs were taken by</text>
  <text start="271.61" dur="6.94">retail section the retail sector but</text>
  <text start="276.27" dur="4.26">when we look at this the Census Bureau</text>
  <text start="278.55" dur="4.83">reports that retail sales declined in</text>
  <text start="280.53" dur="5.49">December and January why would retailers</text>
  <text start="283.38" dur="5.789">hire more people in their stores it</text>
  <text start="286.02" dur="5.58">makes no sense we have all of these</text>
  <text start="289.169" dur="3.84">stores closing laying off people but</text>
  <text start="291.6" dur="4.52">they&amp;#39;re telling us there are hiring</text>
  <text start="293.009" dur="6.241">people something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="296.12" dur="5.65">construction spending declined by 1.1</text>
  <text start="299.25" dur="4.949">percent in January but the payroll jobs</text>
  <text start="301.77" dur="6.899">report says 29,000 construction jobs</text>
  <text start="304.199" dur="7.381">were added in February lumber sales are</text>
  <text start="308.669" dur="7.34">down they&amp;#39;re declining lumber prices are</text>
  <text start="311.58" dur="6.869">falling something just doesn&amp;#39;t jive and</text>
  <text start="316.009" dur="4.211">it&amp;#39;s much easier just to manipulate</text>
  <text start="318.449" dur="3.81">statistical numbers then what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="320.22" dur="4.979">going on here in the United States I</text>
  <text start="322.259" dur="5.16">mean how do they explain away this they</text>
  <text start="325.199" dur="3.991">can&amp;#39;t but it&amp;#39;s easy just to manipulate</text>
  <text start="327.419" dur="3.211">it and put numbers out there and make</text>
  <text start="329.19" dur="4.77">people believe that this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="330.63" dur="4.74">happening because nobody really</text>
  <text start="333.96" dur="3.449">questions it nobody says we&amp;#39;ll wait a</text>
  <text start="335.37" dur="4.59">minute wait a minute we just had</text>
  <text start="337.409" dur="4.141">thousands of stores close tens of</text>
  <text start="339.96" dur="4.5">thousands people tens of thousands of</text>
  <text start="341.55" dur="4.92">people laid off in retail who is hiring</text>
  <text start="344.46" dur="4.26">which let me know which stores let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="346.47" dur="4.29">break it down let&amp;#39;s see which stores are</text>
  <text start="348.72" dur="3.78">actually hiring and where do we get this</text>
  <text start="350.76" dur="6.39">hiring number compared to the amount of</text>
  <text start="352.5" dur="6.72">people that were laid off there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="357.15" dur="4.639">sign in the payroll jobs report of the</text>
  <text start="359.22" dur="5.85">lord layoffs by IBM and hewlett-packard</text>
  <text start="361.789" dur="7.421">they did not report the energy jobs that</text>
  <text start="365.07" dur="6">were lost so you can see all of this is</text>
  <text start="369.21" dur="4.139">completely made up but when we look at</text>
  <text start="371.07" dur="6.45">this we see the u.s. population grew</text>
  <text start="373.349" dur="7.56">from februari 2008 to februari 2015 by</text>
  <text start="377.52" dur="5.01">16.8 million persons or a five point</text>
  <text start="380.909" dur="7.01">five percent increase in total</text>
  <text start="382.53" dur="8.479">population not not a single one of those</text>
  <text start="387.919" dur="6.49">16.8 million persons got a full-time job</text>
  <text start="391.009" dur="7.301">while a net 2.7 million we&amp;#39;re lucky</text>
  <text start="394.409" dur="6.6">enough to get a part-time job this means</text>
  <text start="398.31" dur="4.949">that 14.3 million persons</text>
  <text start="401.009" dur="5.701">4.4 percent of the current u.s.</text>
  <text start="403.259" dur="6.27">population were added without a single</text>
  <text start="406.71" dur="5.039">job among them this makes for a</text>
  <text start="409.529" dur="4.14">fascinating math when a four point four</text>
  <text start="411.749" dur="4.53">percent increase of the total u.s.</text>
  <text start="413.669" dur="5.37">population without jobs can nearly halve</text>
  <text start="416.279" dur="6.181">the ue rate down to five point five</text>
  <text start="419.039" dur="8.25">percent equally to to thousands ue rate</text>
  <text start="422.46" dur="8.759">unemployment rate so something isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="427.289" dur="6.63">right and the math doesn&amp;#39;t jive it</text>
  <text start="431.219" dur="5.04">doesn&amp;#39;t work with what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="433.919" dur="4.31">tell us and we understand that people</text>
  <text start="436.259" dur="4.83">are not spending and there&amp;#39;s proof</text>
  <text start="438.229" dur="4.72">people are trying to keep money in the</text>
  <text start="441.089" dur="3.51">bank this is why we see savings ticking</text>
  <text start="442.949" dur="3.24">up a little bit they don&amp;#39;t want to spend</text>
  <text start="444.599" dur="3.99">this money they&amp;#39;re keeping it in the</text>
  <text start="446.189" dur="4.56">bank because they realize that as time</text>
  <text start="448.589" dur="5.63">goes on gas prices are eventually going</text>
  <text start="450.749" dur="7.771">to go up the cost of food liquor</text>
  <text start="454.219" dur="6.521">clothing rents mortgages they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="458.52" dur="4.41">to go up and they&amp;#39;re protecting</text>
  <text start="460.74" dur="5.25">themselves people aren&amp;#39;t using their</text>
  <text start="462.93" dur="5.969">credit cards right now because either</text>
  <text start="465.99" dur="4.229">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;ve reached their limit or</text>
  <text start="468.899" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re like you know what we need to</text>
  <text start="470.219" dur="3.72">slow down here we can&amp;#39;t go out and</text>
  <text start="472.259" dur="4.83">purchase and we see the consumer credit</text>
  <text start="473.939" dur="5.611">in January crashed from a revised 17.9</text>
  <text start="477.089" dur="5.94">billion to only eleven point six billion</text>
  <text start="479.55" dur="6.509">far below the 414 point seven billion</text>
  <text start="483.029" dur="4.98">expected this is the biggest myth since</text>
  <text start="486.059" dur="5.241">August and the lowest growth and</text>
  <text start="488.009" dur="7.14">consumer credit since november of 2013</text>
  <text start="491.3" dur="7.269">so what does this mean us consumers are</text>
  <text start="495.149" dur="5.49">not only spending not spending but have</text>
  <text start="498.569" dur="5.07">just slammed the brakes on charging on</text>
  <text start="500.639" dur="6.33">their credit cards which in turn</text>
  <text start="503.639" dur="5.911">explains the abysmal retail sales in the</text>
  <text start="506.969" dur="6.211">past two months because people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="509.55" dur="5.339">going out and mine they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="513.18" dur="4.289">their situation they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="514.889" dur="4.231">income coming in anymore people are</text>
  <text start="517.469" dur="4.831">being laid off they&amp;#39;re getting part-time</text>
  <text start="519.12" dur="5.579">jobs and we are just tapped out at this</text>
  <text start="522.3" dur="8.519">point we don&amp;#39;t have the money to go on</text>
  <text start="524.699" dur="9.301">as i reported in chicago the people are</text>
  <text start="530.819" dur="7.431">out there they are rallying to shut down</text>
  <text start="534" dur="6.96">the home on a police black site and</text>
  <text start="538.25" dur="7.78">they&amp;#39;re out there posted protesting</text>

  <text start="604.86" dur="5.31">movement of heavy artillery being moved</text>
  <text start="606.81" dur="4.71">away from the front lines and it seems</text>

  <text start="651.39" dur="4.32">more examples of general Breedlove slips</text>
