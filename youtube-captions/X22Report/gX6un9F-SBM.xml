  <text start="123.27" dur="6.659">bursting looks like things are not going</text>
  <text start="126.6" dur="6.99">well because in Vancouver&amp;#39;s real estate</text>
  <text start="129.929" dur="6.451">market deals are falling through as</text>
  <text start="133.59" dur="5.67">foreign buyers are forfeiting their</text>
  <text start="136.38" dur="6.78">deposits on binding deals right then</text>
  <text start="139.26" dur="6.569">rather pay the new tax there is evidence</text>
  <text start="143.16" dur="4.26">of local buyers withdrawing offers an</text>

  <text start="163.56" dur="3.12">houses saying</text>
  <text start="164.28" dur="6.66">this means the prices are going to come</text>
  <text start="166.68" dur="6.6">way down so people are looking at the</text>
  <text start="170.94" dur="4.65">real estate market not just here in the</text>
  <text start="173.28" dur="5.19">United States not in the UK but in</text>
  <text start="175.59" dur="5.28">Canada and many other areas and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="178.47" dur="6.3">starting to realize that prices are</text>
  <text start="180.87" dur="7.26">going to start to come down and this is</text>
  <text start="184.77" dur="7.35">going to be an event just like we saw</text>
  <text start="188.13" dur="6.96">back in 2008 remember how quickly the</text>
  <text start="192.12" dur="4.35">real estate market fell apart we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="195.09" dur="2.73">going to see the same thing happen but</text>
  <text start="196.47" dur="3.269">this time it&amp;#39;s going to be much much</text>
  <text start="197.82" dur="6.33">worse because last time the people</text>
  <text start="199.739" dur="9.201">actually owned the homes this time the</text>
  <text start="204.15" dur="9.03">American people the Canadian people be</text>
  <text start="208.94" dur="5.799">European people well they don&amp;#39;t own the</text>
  <text start="213.18" dur="3.87">homes there&amp;#39;s a lot of speculators</text>
  <text start="214.739" dur="5.22">there&amp;#39;s a lot of hedge funds investment</text>
  <text start="217.05" dur="5.159">companies there&amp;#39;s a lot of free money</text>
  <text start="219.959" dur="5.671">out there and guess what they all went</text>
  <text start="222.209" dur="9.361">into boosting pumping this real estate</text>
  <text start="225.63" dur="8.449">market up now ADP is out there and they</text>
  <text start="231.57" dur="5.699">just came out with their jobs report and</text>
  <text start="234.079" dur="5.741">they&amp;#39;re saying July&amp;#39;s 179,000 pretty</text>
  <text start="237.269" dur="5.31">beat expectations of a hundred and</text>
  <text start="239.82" dur="6.21">seventy thousand it is still below the</text>
  <text start="242.579" dur="5.611">payroll levels and very interestingly we</text>
  <text start="246.03" dur="5.13">talked about construction construction</text>
  <text start="248.19" dur="6.299">spending the payroll of construction and</text>
  <text start="251.16" dur="6.66">we see that jobs in construction while</text>
  <text start="254.489" dur="6.24">they are sliding and this is not a good</text>
  <text start="257.82" dur="5.34">sign whatsoever so we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="260.729" dur="5.101">construction spending slot declining</text>
  <text start="263.16" dur="6.36">we&amp;#39;re seeing construction jobs following</text>
  <text start="265.83" dur="8.24">that and both of them are declining at</text>
  <text start="269.52" dur="8.01">the same time and right now we see that</text>
  <text start="274.07" dur="5.04">this is going to be a huge problem and</text>
  <text start="277.53" dur="4.08">we know that these numbers are</text>
  <text start="279.11" dur="5.2">manipulated to make the entire economy</text>
  <text start="281.61" dur="6.35">look a lot better and the excuse that</text>
  <text start="284.31" dur="7.109">they&amp;#39;re using today is the biggest</text>
  <text start="287.96" dur="7.329">problem that we&amp;#39;re going to have is the</text>
  <text start="291.419" dur="5.701">lack of available workers maybe hundred</text>
  <text start="295.289" dur="2.951">thousand one hundred million or so</text>
  <text start="297.12" dur="3.93">people</text>
  <text start="298.24" dur="5.85">that want a job but you can&amp;#39;t find one</text>
  <text start="301.05" dur="5.26">we can&amp;#39;t tap any of those people I think</text>
  <text start="304.09" dur="4.829">what they&amp;#39;re really saying here is that</text>
  <text start="306.31" dur="6.15">as wages continually decreasing as we</text>
  <text start="308.919" dur="8.97">approach this third-world type of nation</text>
  <text start="312.46" dur="8.489">scenario we need those people who are</text>
  <text start="317.889" dur="6">going to earn a dollar fifty two dollars</text>
  <text start="320.949" dur="6.511">three dollars an hour because I do</text>
  <text start="323.889" dur="8.551">believe that the powers that be they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="327.46" dur="7.53">preparing this country for a third world</text>
  <text start="332.44" dur="5.34">job market because if we look in the</text>
  <text start="334.99" dur="6.149">past wages continually increase now</text>
  <text start="337.78" dur="5.81">we&amp;#39;re seeing wages decline and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="341.139" dur="5.331">seeing more and more illegal immigrants</text>
  <text start="343.59" dur="4.66">come into this country I have nothing</text>
  <text start="346.47" dur="5.259">against people coming into this country</text>
  <text start="348.25" dur="6.87">there is a process they should follow we</text>
  <text start="351.729" dur="9.891">do have borders for a reason and I</text>
  <text start="355.12" dur="9.84">believe the agenda is to fill those jobs</text>
  <text start="361.62" dur="6.789">with those individuals that are used to</text>
  <text start="364.96" dur="7.44">making very low wages because we know</text>
  <text start="368.409" dur="4.831">the TPP one of the sections there where</text>
  <text start="372.4" dur="2.639">they said they&amp;#39;re going to bring back</text>

  <text start="381.19" dur="5.909">they will be paid in the currency and</text>
  <text start="384.639" dur="5.28">the wages they were making in their</text>
  <text start="387.099" dur="6.06">country how does the u.s. worker compete</text>
  <text start="389.919" dur="5.06">with that they cannot and when we look</text>
  <text start="393.159" dur="5.841">at the situation we see the economic</text>
  <text start="394.979" dur="8.321">indicators they&amp;#39;re just getting worse</text>

  <text start="425.8" dur="3.929">I mean they&amp;#39;ll come up with any reason</text>
  <text start="427.24" dur="5.22">why their sales are declining and the</text>
  <text start="429.729" dur="5.311">real reason is because the people</text>
  <text start="432.46" dur="7.41">have the funds to go out and spend on</text>
  <text start="435.04" dur="7.74">these type of items we see New York</text>

  <text start="457.11" dur="6.13">continually dropping and then we look at</text>

  <text start="473.58" dur="10.78">Chrysler down two percent and we are</text>
  <text start="478.51" dur="8.55">seeing this entire thing implode right</text>
  <text start="484.36" dur="4.71">in front of our eyes GM they managed to</text>
  <text start="487.06" dur="5.94">grow their retail sales by five percent</text>
  <text start="489.07" dur="5.84">but they had incentives and they spent</text>
  <text start="493" dur="4.71">twenty nine percent over the competition</text>
  <text start="494.91" dur="4.11">two fourteen point two percent of total</text>
  <text start="497.71" dur="3.75">retail value</text>
  <text start="499.02" dur="7.18">looks like GM is doing the same thing</text>
  <text start="501.46" dur="5.61">they did prior to 2008 and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="506.2" dur="2.85">going to go over well</text>
  <text start="507.07" dur="6.3">now the biggest winner right now is</text>
  <text start="509.05" dur="6.989">truck sales most of the truck gains for</text>
  <text start="513.37" dur="5.16">Ford came from cargo vans which were up</text>

  <text start="526.47" dur="8.55">when we look at this we can see that the</text>
  <text start="529.39" dur="10.68">truck sales the auto sales that were</text>
  <text start="535.02" dur="7.45">included in the entire calculation most</text>
  <text start="540.07" dur="6.269">of it came from fleet sales and</text>
  <text start="542.47" dur="7.47">government purchases the everyday person</text>
  <text start="546.339" dur="6.361">is not boosting the auto sales and we</text>
  <text start="549.94" dur="5.76">also have to remember how the auto sales</text>
  <text start="552.7" dur="4.98">are actually really calculated when the</text>
  <text start="555.7" dur="7.139">government comes out with these numbers</text>
  <text start="557.68" dur="7.86">and for the customer base whenever they</text>
  <text start="562.839" dur="6.99">channel stuff a lot</text>
  <text start="565.54" dur="6.78">they count that as a sale so when we</text>
  <text start="569.829" dur="5.731">look at this entire situation the auto</text>
  <text start="572.32" dur="7.98">market is declining right now when we</text>
  <text start="575.56" dur="8.82">look at this service economy well this</text>
