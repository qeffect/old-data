  <text start="55.14" dur="6.669">continually gets worse and worse and of</text>
  <text start="59.379" dur="5.011">course the corporate media the US</text>
  <text start="61.809" dur="5.551">government the central bank&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="64.39" dur="4.83">still out there trying to convince the</text>
  <text start="67.36" dur="3.75">world the people of the United States</text>
  <text start="69.22" dur="4.2">that everything is fine here in the</text>
  <text start="71.11" dur="6.27">United States there&amp;#39;s absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="73.42" dur="6.66">wrong the economy is chugging along it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="77.38" dur="6.12">perfect and yes we&amp;#39;re going to be doing</text>
  <text start="80.08" dur="6.899">interest rate hikes very very soon now</text>
  <text start="83.5" dur="6.42">we know if the Fed moves ahead with an</text>
  <text start="86.979" dur="6.09">interest rate hike we know this is a</text>
  <text start="89.92" dur="4.86">signal letting us know that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="93.069" dur="4.491">prepared to take this economy down think</text>
  <text start="94.78" dur="5.76">about it the rest of the world is in</text>
  <text start="97.56" dur="6.72">negative interest rates but the United</text>
  <text start="100.54" dur="5.91">States is preparing to raise rates and</text>
  <text start="104.28" dur="4.75">we know what happened last time they</text>
  <text start="106.45" dur="6.239">raise rates things started to rapidly</text>
  <text start="109.03" dur="8.839">fall apart and when they do it for a</text>
  <text start="112.689" dur="7.261">second time it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot worse</text>
  <text start="117.869" dur="6.011">but of course it&amp;#39;s not going to happen</text>
  <text start="119.95" dur="6.65">right away it might take two or three</text>
  <text start="123.88" dur="6.629">months and they&amp;#39;re prepared for this</text>
  <text start="126.6" dur="6.4">they&amp;#39;re getting ready for this but when</text>
  <text start="130.509" dur="4.711">we look at this economy we see that</text>
  <text start="133" dur="7.85">things are rapidly deteriorating very</text>
  <text start="135.22" dur="8.21">very quickly we see that Americans well</text>
  <text start="140.85" dur="9.3">thirty-four percent of Americans today</text>
  <text start="143.43" dur="9.309">have zero dollars in their savings now</text>
  <text start="150.15" dur="6.52">Americans they&amp;#39;re dipping into their</text>
  <text start="152.739" dur="6.271">savings if they have any even more than</text>
  <text start="156.67" dur="5.49">they did last year and this is coming</text>
  <text start="159.01" dur="5.43">from a new survey nearly seventy percent</text>
  <text start="162.16" dur="6.63">of americans report having less</text>
  <text start="164.44" dur="5.85">one thousand dollars in savings and the</text>
  <text start="168.79" dur="5.55">pattern really touches all age groups</text>
  <text start="170.29" dur="6.48">and we can see a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="174.34" dur="4.68">living on credit a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="176.77" dur="4.41">just getting by a lot of people have</text>
  <text start="179.02" dur="4.38">lost their jobs and this is why they</text>
  <text start="181.18" dur="5.1">have to dip into their savings this is</text>
  <text start="183.4" dur="5.7">why they have to live on credit because</text>
  <text start="186.28" dur="7.4">they cannot find those same high paying</text>
  <text start="189.1" dur="9.33">jobs and we can see the corporate media</text>
  <text start="193.68" dur="7.03">is out there the Fed is out there the US</text>
  <text start="198.43" dur="3.96">government is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="200.71" dur="3.63">giving a lot of statistical information</text>
  <text start="202.39" dur="5.31">to they&amp;#39;re giving us a lot of</text>
  <text start="204.34" dur="5.81">statistical information and we know that</text>
  <text start="207.7" dur="6.21">they manipulate the information they can</text>
  <text start="210.15" dur="8.73">drop people off the workforce they can</text>
  <text start="213.91" dur="7.29">revise the numbers they can we calculate</text>
  <text start="218.88" dur="4.93">different numbers and go back in time</text>
  <text start="221.2" dur="5.34">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is the</text>
  <text start="223.81" dur="5.7">mainstream reported that there was a</text>
  <text start="226.54" dur="8.94">five point two percent gain in the real</text>
  <text start="229.51" dur="8.01">median house household income in 2015 so</text>
  <text start="235.48" dur="5.52">what they&amp;#39;re saying is the u.s.</text>
  <text start="237.52" dur="5.52">household income sword in 2015 this of</text>
  <text start="241" dur="4.83">course is the biggest gain in decades</text>
  <text start="243.04" dur="5.19">the data represents the clearest</text>
  <text start="245.83" dur="4.56">evidence to date that the nation&amp;#39;s long</text>
  <text start="248.23" dur="5.24">slow and topsy-turvy economic recovery</text>
  <text start="250.39" dur="7.26">has finally begun to deliver prosperity</text>
  <text start="253.47" dur="7.299">for many of the people out there now of</text>
  <text start="257.65" dur="7.25">course you&amp;#39;re probably sitting there</text>
  <text start="260.769" dur="9.001">going wait what what are they saying now</text>
  <text start="264.9" dur="8.53">what we are actually seeing is that the</text>
  <text start="269.77" dur="8.36">US government decided to manipulate</text>
  <text start="273.43" dur="9.81">these numbers and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="278.13" dur="7.9">that these numbers make no sense because</text>
  <text start="283.24" dur="4.98">how is this completely possible when the</text>
  <text start="286.03" dur="5.43">nominal gdp increased only by three</text>
  <text start="288.22" dur="6.63">percent during 2015 disposable personal</text>
  <text start="291.46" dur="6.15">income again in nominal terms grew by</text>
  <text start="294.85" dur="3.17">just three point seven percent the fact</text>
  <text start="297.61" dur="3.15">is</text>
  <text start="298.02" dur="5.8">the median income can grow nearly twice</text>
  <text start="300.76" dur="4.95">as fast as aggregate income only if</text>
  <text start="303.82" dur="4.71">gains in the middle and bottom of the</text>
  <text start="305.71" dur="6.15">income ladder grew far faster than the</text>
  <text start="308.53" dur="5.52">total income pie that is if earnings of</text>
  <text start="311.86" dur="4.53">the average worker rose faster than the</text>
  <text start="314.05" dur="4.29">big bucks earned by like bankers and</text>
  <text start="316.39" dur="4.65">athletes lawyers business executives</text>
  <text start="318.34" dur="7.08">that would make sense but it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="321.04" dur="7.38">happen of course the Census Bureau own</text>
  <text start="325.42" dur="5.7">report proves it the median nominal</text>
  <text start="328.42" dur="5.31">earnings of full-time male workers grew</text>
  <text start="331.12" dur="6.63">grew by just one point six percent in</text>
  <text start="333.73" dur="6.45">2015 full-time female workers grew by</text>
  <text start="337.75" dur="6.03">two point eight percent that&amp;#39;s not five</text>
  <text start="340.18" dur="8.4">point seven percent growth what they did</text>
  <text start="343.78" dur="9.27">is they went back to 2014 and they shot</text>
  <text start="348.58" dur="6.51">the data up to make it look like the</text>
  <text start="353.05" dur="4.05">entire country is doing much better and</text>
  <text start="355.09" dur="3.78">of course most likely they did this for</text>
  <text start="357.1" dur="5.34">the election so they went back in time</text>
  <text start="358.87" dur="9.109">and they manipulated the data once again</text>
  <text start="362.44" dur="11.25">and we can see right now they do this</text>
  <text start="367.979" dur="8.581">very often and the CEO of Gallup was</text>
  <text start="373.69" dur="6.09">looking at the data for the recovery and</text>
  <text start="376.56" dur="7.03">he&amp;#39;s saying well there really is no</text>
  <text start="379.78" dur="6.389">recovery it is a lie the percentage of</text>
  <text start="383.59" dur="4.29">Americans who say they are in the middle</text>
  <text start="386.169" dur="3.931">or upper class right now well that is</text>
  <text start="387.88" dur="4.05">fallen by ten percent points from 61</text>
  <text start="390.1" dur="3.51">percent between two thousand eight and</text>
  <text start="391.93" dur="6.23">two thousand two thousand and two</text>
  <text start="393.61" dur="7.95">thousand eight to 51-percent today so</text>
  <text start="398.16" dur="6.13">ten percent of 250 million adults in the</text>
  <text start="401.56" dur="8.609">US is 25 million people whose economic</text>
  <text start="404.29" dur="7.77">lives have crashed and what is missing</text>
  <text start="410.169" dur="7.411">is that these 25 million people are</text>
  <text start="412.06" dur="9.51">invisible in the reported unemployment</text>
  <text start="417.58" dur="7.05">figures which they show us unemployment</text>
  <text start="421.57" dur="5.04">is at four point nine percent the sudden</text>
  <text start="424.63" dur="6.15">loss of household income can cause a</text>
  <text start="426.61" dur="5.07">crash of self-esteem and dignity leading</text>
  <text start="430.78" dur="3.389">to</text>
  <text start="431.68" dur="4.41">environment of desperation that we</text>
  <text start="434.169" dur="5.78">haven&amp;#39;t seen since the Great Depression</text>
  <text start="436.09" dur="7.889">and this is exactly what is happening</text>
  <text start="439.949" dur="6.821">out in the country today people who are</text>
  <text start="443.979" dur="5.611">still looking for work they become</text>
  <text start="446.77" dur="8.01">depressed they feel like there is no</text>
  <text start="449.59" dur="7.919">work out there many people just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="454.78" dur="4.889">deal with it and I&amp;#39;ve seen it when</text>
  <text start="457.509" dur="6.72">people have gotten laid off they go into</text>
  <text start="459.669" dur="7.831">hiding they get very upset and we can</text>
  <text start="464.229" dur="5.581">see right now that most of what the</text>
  <text start="467.5" dur="5.16">government the BLS what they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="469.81" dur="5.19">us it&amp;#39;s all lies I mean according to the</text>
  <text start="472.66" dur="4.5">US bureau of labor statistics the</text>
  <text start="475" dur="4.38">percentage of total US adult population</text>
  <text start="477.16" dur="3.84">that as a full-time job has been</text>
  <text start="479.38" dur="5.34">hovering around forty eight percent</text>
  <text start="481" dur="13.139">since 2010 this is the lowest full-time</text>
  <text start="484.72" dur="12.72">employment level since 1983 so think</text>
  <text start="494.139" dur="6.631">about this for a second we&amp;#39;re back to</text>
  <text start="497.44" dur="5.82">nineteen eighty three levels kind of</text>
  <text start="500.77" dur="6.63">recovery is this when the population is</text>
  <text start="503.26" dur="5.939">much larger than it was in 1983 the</text>
  <text start="507.4" dur="4.38">number of publicly listed companies</text>
  <text start="509.199" dur="4.921">trading on the US exchanges has been cut</text>
  <text start="511.78" dur="7.86">almost in half in the past twenty years</text>
  <text start="514.12" dur="9.63">from about 7,300 to 3,700 why because</text>
  <text start="519.64" dur="7.17">they can&amp;#39;t grow organically they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="523.75" dur="6.15">get new business they can&amp;#39;t bring in</text>
  <text start="526.81" dur="5.79">revenue they can&amp;#39;t keep their existing</text>
  <text start="529.9" dur="5.82">customers and this is why corporations</text>
  <text start="532.6" dur="6.05">are having a major problem today new</text>
  <text start="535.72" dur="5.91">business startups are at historical lows</text>
  <text start="538.65" dur="6.309">Americans have stopped starting small</text>
  <text start="541.63" dur="5.34">businesses and the businesses that do</text>
  <text start="544.959" dur="6.931">start are growing a historically slow</text>
  <text start="546.97" dur="7.8">rates free enterprise is in freefall how</text>
  <text start="551.89" dur="5.52">possibly are we in a recovery because</text>
  <text start="554.77" dur="7.23">small business makes up most of the</text>
  <text start="557.41" dur="7.2">employment today well it&amp;#39;s not true</text>
  <text start="562" dur="3.76">they&amp;#39;re lying to us once again when we</text>
  <text start="564.61" dur="3.73">look at the cast freight</text>
  <text start="565.76" dur="5.19">index for August we see that trucking</text>
  <text start="568.34" dur="4.8">rail traffic it is down by one point one</text>
  <text start="570.95" dur="5.79">percent from a year ago this is the</text>
  <text start="573.14" dur="6.24">worst since august of 2010 this is the</text>
  <text start="576.74" dur="6.18">18th month in a row that we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="579.38" dur="7.95">these declines overall shipment volumes</text>
  <text start="582.92" dur="8.25">well they&amp;#39;re very weak and the situation</text>
  <text start="587.33" dur="6.21">that we&amp;#39;re looking at is deteriorating</text>
  <text start="591.17" dur="5.37">very very quickly the Association of</text>
  <text start="593.54" dur="7.56">American railroads well they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="596.54" dur="6.6">that oil and coal and other commodities</text>
  <text start="601.1" dur="4.76">fell by six point six percent in August</text>
  <text start="603.14" dur="5.55">from a year ago an intermodal traffic</text>
  <text start="605.86" dur="6.73">containers and trailers fell by four</text>
  <text start="608.69" dur="6.75">point eight percent so we can see right</text>
  <text start="612.59" dur="5.52">now that when we&amp;#39;re looking at all the</text>
  <text start="615.44" dur="7.62">different economic indicators we see</text>
  <text start="618.11" dur="8.64">that the system it&amp;#39;s collapsing the</text>
  <text start="623.06" dur="6.77">system is not improving now something</text>
  <text start="626.75" dur="6.27">very interesting is happening right now</text>
  <text start="629.83" dur="5.38">the US dollar just stage its second</text>
  <text start="633.02" dur="7.59">biggest single day rally of the year on</text>
  <text start="635.21" dur="9">Friday the only other day which the US</text>
  <text start="640.61" dur="6.32">dollar rallied more was on the brexit</text>
  <text start="644.21" dur="7.26">when the entire global currency system</text>
  <text start="646.93" dur="7.3">pretty much came unhinged now this kind</text>
  <text start="651.47" dur="5.52">of move is a clear signal that may be</text>
  <text start="654.23" dur="6.98">something major is underway behind the</text>
  <text start="656.99" dur="9.36">scenes and that something might be a</text>
  <text start="661.21" dur="7.69">European bank crisis remember the EU</text>
  <text start="666.35" dur="6.17">banking system is three times the size</text>
  <text start="668.9" dur="6.87">of the US and their leverage 26 to one</text>
  <text start="672.52" dur="10.57">Lehman was leveraged 32 1 when it</text>
  <text start="675.77" dur="11.19">collapsed and when the EU banking system</text>
  <text start="683.09" dur="7.61">collapses it will be a domino effect and</text>
  <text start="686.96" dur="6.86">it will eventually hit the United States</text>
  <text start="690.7" dur="5.77">we saw this back in the Great Depression</text>
  <text start="693.82" dur="6.79">Europe was</text>
  <text start="696.47" dur="7.56">horrific through the 20s and into the</text>
  <text start="700.61" dur="4.77">late 20s Europe was reeling the United</text>
  <text start="704.03" dur="3.33">States was saying woods the good times</text>
  <text start="705.38" dur="3.65">look nothing could ever go about the</text>
  <text start="707.36" dur="4.59">stock market is at all-time highs</text>
  <text start="709.03" dur="4.3">nothing could ever go wrong everyone was</text>
  <text start="711.95" dur="3.84">partying everything when everyone</text>
  <text start="713.33" dur="5.04">thought everything was great and then</text>
  <text start="715.79" dur="7.85">boom snap of a finger everything came to</text>
  <text start="718.37" dur="8.52">a screeching halt here we are in 2016</text>
  <text start="723.64" dur="5.38">same thing everyone is out there</text>
  <text start="726.89" dur="3.72">thinking everything is great the</text>
  <text start="729.02" dur="3.84">corporate media the US government the</text>
  <text start="730.61" dur="5.64">central bank&amp;#39;s telling you how great it</text>
  <text start="732.86" dur="5.82">is we&amp;#39;re continually recovering things</text>
  <text start="736.25" dur="5.97">are looking up and then with the snap of</text>
  <text start="738.68" dur="7.95">a finger boom everything comes tumbling</text>
  <text start="742.22" dur="6.84">down we saw it in 2008 all the way up to</text>
  <text start="746.63" dur="5.07">that point they told us everything was</text>
  <text start="749.06" dur="6.45">contained fine the economy is doing well</text>
  <text start="751.7" dur="9.24">go out and spend everybody we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="755.51" dur="9.06">the same exact signs now a former</text>
  <text start="760.94" dur="7.8">financial advisor and a prominent Saudi</text>
  <text start="764.57" dur="7.44">economist said that Saudi Arabia well</text>
  <text start="768.74" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;re on the verge of collapse and we</text>
  <text start="772.01" dur="7.62">know right now that Saudi Arabia they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="774.32" dur="7.65">in a war with Yemen which Yemen ever</text>
  <text start="779.63" dur="6.69">attacked them Saudi Arabia has been</text>
  <text start="781.97" dur="6.21">pumping oil keeping the price very low</text>
  <text start="786.32" dur="5.25">we have a glut of oil on the market</text>
  <text start="788.18" dur="5.46">right now we know that this has hooked</text>
  <text start="791.57" dur="4.41">too many different agendas one to put</text>
  <text start="793.64" dur="5.22">pressure on Russia didn&amp;#39;t work the other</text>
  <text start="795.98" dur="5.9">is to keep the oil prices very low so</text>
  <text start="798.86" dur="5.99">that people can go out and spend and</text>
  <text start="801.88" dur="7.02">corporations can stay profitable</text>
  <text start="804.85" dur="9.97">remember all the deliveries Airlines</text>
