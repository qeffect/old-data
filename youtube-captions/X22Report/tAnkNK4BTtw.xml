  <text start="123.32" dur="5.88">government has very interestingly the</text>
  <text start="126.469" dur="7.471">Supreme Court declined to hear their</text>
  <text start="129.2" dur="6.84">petition and they were trying to force</text>
  <text start="133.94" dur="4.35">the Department of Homeland Security to</text>
  <text start="136.04" dur="4.53">release the details of this switch and</text>

  <text start="167.17" dur="7.769">received certain documents on what it</text>
  <text start="171.17" dur="8.12">was and the document that they have</text>
  <text start="174.939" dur="7.511">basically shows there is a shutdown and</text>
  <text start="179.29" dur="5.169">restoration process for use by</text>
  <text start="182.45" dur="7.319">commercial and private wireless networks</text>
  <text start="184.459" dur="10.101">during a national crisis so if the</text>
  <text start="189.769" dur="9.741">United States was under some type of</text>
  <text start="194.56" dur="10.929">national crisis some type of an event</text>
  <text start="199.51" dur="9.66">the government can basically kill the</text>
  <text start="205.489" dur="6.541">internet kill the cell phone service and</text>
  <text start="209.17" dur="4.929">people say well why would they want to</text>
  <text start="212.03" dur="4.53">do this well you have to remember if</text>
  <text start="214.099" dur="4.381">they do kill the internet and they do</text>
  <text start="216.56" dur="4.47">kill the self cell phone service if</text>
  <text start="218.48" dur="5.849">we&amp;#39;re under some type of false flag</text>
  <text start="221.03" dur="7.47">event let&amp;#39;s say we&amp;#39;re many different</text>
  <text start="224.329" dur="6.151">cities are being bombed the financial</text>
  <text start="228.5" dur="4.019">institutions are being cyberattack they</text>
  <text start="230.48" dur="3.99">would say listen the only way to stop</text>
  <text start="232.519" dur="4.83">this because we don&amp;#39;t know where the</text>
  <text start="234.47" dur="5.01">next hit will be we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="237.349" dur="3.75">bring down the internet because the</text>
  <text start="239.48" dur="4.589">financial institution the stock market</text>
  <text start="241.099" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re being attacked we don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="244.069" dur="4.411">it&amp;#39;s malware that&amp;#39;s implanted in these</text>
  <text start="245.989" dur="5.131">systems and they will shut it down just</text>
  <text start="248.48" dur="6.03">like they had the procedures to shut the</text>
  <text start="251.12" dur="7.619">entire air traffic over the United</text>
  <text start="254.51" dur="6.409">States down during 9/11 so this would be</text>
  <text start="258.739" dur="5.371">a national crisis and this would be a</text>
  <text start="260.919" dur="6.091">time and place that they would use this</text>
  <text start="264.11" dur="10.47">and remember once they shut this down</text>
  <text start="267.01" dur="12.159">all internet news reporting all videos</text>
  <text start="274.58" dur="9">all cell phone transmissions cease to</text>
  <text start="279.169" dur="6.99">exist and where do you get your news and</text>
  <text start="283.58" dur="6.869">your information at that point the</text>
  <text start="286.159" dur="7.26">corporate media you see what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="290.449" dur="5.251">trying to do here they are basically</text>
  <text start="293.419" dur="5.111">setting it up they&amp;#39;re going to tell you</text>
  <text start="295.7" dur="5.68">it&amp;#39;s in your best interest and</text>
  <text start="298.53" dur="5.13">will this hurt many businesses of course</text>
  <text start="301.38" dur="4.8">it will but we need to remember one</text>
  <text start="303.66" dur="5.49">important fact the system that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="306.18" dur="7.59">created is dead</text>
  <text start="309.15" dur="6.81">it&amp;#39;s collapsing and at this point once</text>
  <text start="313.77" dur="3">this occurs the system completely</text>
  <text start="315.96" dur="5.22">collapsed</text>
  <text start="316.77" dur="7.86">because we know they have what&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="321.18" dur="4.62">the beylin documents we know the</text>
  <text start="324.63" dur="4.23">government&amp;#39;s aren&amp;#39;t going to bail out</text>
  <text start="325.8" dur="4.71">the central bankers we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="328.86" dur="5.67">gonna they&amp;#39;re going to be going into the</text>
  <text start="330.51" dur="6.87">banks so everything can keep operating</text>
  <text start="334.53" dur="5.31">and they will shut down the stock market</text>
  <text start="337.38" dur="4.83">they will shut down the banking system</text>
  <text start="339.84" dur="4.62">they will shut down the internet</text>
  <text start="342.21" dur="5.36">transmission of data they will shut down</text>
  <text start="344.46" dur="6.45">the cell towers and they will control</text>
  <text start="347.57" dur="4.72">that entire arena you will get your</text>
  <text start="350.91" dur="2.79">information from the TV from the</text>
  <text start="352.29" dur="4.53">corporate media from whatever the</text>
  <text start="353.7" dur="5.31">government wants to tell you and at this</text>
  <text start="356.82" dur="5.97">point in time this will be a call for</text>
  <text start="359.01" dur="5.97">war and there will be no way of getting</text>
  <text start="362.79" dur="4.77">any type of information from anywhere</text>
  <text start="364.98" dur="4.35">else especially on the internet now if</text>
  <text start="367.56" dur="3.45">you have shortwave radio and those type</text>
  <text start="369.33" dur="3.839">of things yes you&amp;#39;ll still be able to</text>
  <text start="371.01" dur="4.68">access that and get information but what</text>
  <text start="373.169" dur="6.691">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is they are</text>
  <text start="375.69" dur="8.49">prepared and ready and they will use</text>
  <text start="379.86" dur="6.93">this in a national crisis when</text>
  <text start="384.18" dur="5.85">everything has failed when they have to</text>
  <text start="386.79" dur="5.25">bring on the false flag event and they</text>
  <text start="390.03" dur="5.79">are desperate to start this war to cover</text>
  <text start="392.04" dur="5.64">all of this up they will go ahead and do</text>
  <text start="395.82" dur="4.17">this and of course later on they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="397.68" dur="7.41">bring everything back up once we are in</text>
  <text start="399.99" dur="7.02">the war now in Afghanistan we know the</text>
  <text start="405.09" dur="5.85">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="407.01" dur="5.969">NATO never leaving Afghanistan never</text>
  <text start="410.94" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;re gonna leave even though the</text>
  <text start="412.979" dur="4.261">president told us that the US troops</text>
  <text start="415.35" dur="4.74">were coming home we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="417.24" dur="5.64">opposite occur right now and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="420.09" dur="6.96">interesting about Afghanistan a lot of</text>
  <text start="422.88" dur="7.83">money is thrown in there to the</text>
  <text start="427.05" dur="5.01">Afghanistan government to rebuild to</text>
  <text start="430.71" dur="5.16">build their infrastructure</text>
  <text start="432.06" dur="5.61">and the cigar report found that the</text>
  <text start="435.87" dur="4.86">department defense task force for</text>
  <text start="437.67" dur="6.29">business stability operations and the US</text>
  <text start="440.73" dur="7.08">Agency for International Development us</text>
  <text start="443.96" dur="7.54">are failing to accomplish their</text>
  <text start="447.81" dur="5.37">collective mission and so far there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="451.5" dur="5.67">been about a half a billion dollars</text>
  <text start="453.18" dur="7.88">spent in Afghanistan since 2009 to</text>
  <text start="457.17" dur="6.93">develop the industry in Afghanistan and</text>
  <text start="461.06" dur="7">all of this money that&amp;#39;s been thrown</text>
  <text start="464.1" dur="6.48">into here has kind of disappeared and a</text>
  <text start="468.06" dur="4.109">watchdog group said listen the things</text>
  <text start="470.58" dur="3.66">they wanted to do would only cost about</text>
  <text start="472.169" dur="4.951">three hundred thousand I don&amp;#39;t know why</text>
  <text start="474.24" dur="5.01">this total right now is up to five</text>
  <text start="477.12" dur="4.32">hundred million because we know what</text>
  <text start="479.25" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re doing with it they&amp;#39;re putting it</text>
  <text start="481.44" dur="5.01">into their pockets it&amp;#39;s being siphoned</text>
  <text start="483.45" dur="6.9">off just like everything else the</text>
  <text start="486.45" dur="6.81">government does now out in Ukraine we</text>
  <text start="490.35" dur="6.48">see poroshenko he admits to coordinating</text>
  <text start="493.26" dur="6.71">actions of radicals where they brought</text>
  <text start="496.83" dur="7.37">down the power in Crimea</text>
  <text start="499.97" dur="7.66">he says he&amp;#39;s basically working with them</text>
  <text start="504.2" dur="5.89">for this ongoing energy blockade but we</text>
  <text start="507.63" dur="4.65">know Crimea is now working with Russia</text>
  <text start="510.09" dur="5.19">and they laid power cables through the</text>
  <text start="512.28" dur="5.16">Kerch Strait to bring power into Crimea</text>
  <text start="515.28" dur="3.99">and they&amp;#39;re cutting themselves off from</text>
  <text start="517.44" dur="4.83">Ukraine they&amp;#39;re saying they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="519.27" dur="6.96">the power from Ukraine anymore so it</text>
  <text start="522.27" dur="5.88">really doesn&amp;#39;t matter we know the United</text>
  <text start="526.23" dur="5.19">States government central bankers passed</text>
  <text start="528.15" dur="7.82">the omnibus bill and we know there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="531.42" dur="11.13">lot of aid going towards Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="535.97" dur="11.05">inside the bill we see they were going</text>
  <text start="542.55" dur="8.81">to ban aid to the neo-nazi type of</text>
  <text start="547.02" dur="8.069">groups operating inside Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="551.36" dur="8.53">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is when this</text>
  <text start="555.089" dur="8.611">omnibus bill went to Obama the</text>
  <text start="559.89" dur="5.73">provisions were removed from the final</text>
  <text start="563.7" dur="4.65">version</text>
  <text start="565.62" dur="8.01">of the pentagon funding bill and the</text>
  <text start="568.35" dur="8.51">2016 omnibus budget so the law</text>
  <text start="573.63" dur="6.89">authorized pentagon to provide Kiev with</text>
  <text start="576.86" dur="7.15">anti-armor weapon systems mortars</text>
  <text start="580.52" dur="7">ammunition grenade launchers small arms</text>
  <text start="584.01" dur="7.769">and ammunition counter artillery radars</text>
  <text start="587.52" dur="6.18">drones cyber capabilities and they also</text>
  <text start="591.779" dur="4.861">have in there that they can train the</text>
  <text start="593.7" dur="5.28">Kiev regime forces and will be managed</text>
  <text start="596.64" dur="6.949">by the American 173rd Airborne Brigade</text>
  <text start="598.98" dur="8.549">at Camp in the view in western Ukraine</text>
  <text start="603.589" dur="7.601">so the question is how did this happen</text>
  <text start="607.529" dur="7.381">well last summer as the NDAA was making</text>
  <text start="611.19" dur="6.66">its way through Congress John Conyers</text>
  <text start="614.91" dur="5.73">and Ted Yoho put forth an amendment that</text>
  <text start="617.85" dur="6.239">would have ruled out training or arming</text>
  <text start="620.64" dur="7.38">the notorious Azov battalion which is a</text>
  <text start="624.089" dur="5.94">neo Nazi and fascist unit that operates</text>
  <text start="628.02" dur="6.33">inside of Ukraine which was part of the</text>
  <text start="630.029" dur="6.621">coup d&amp;#39;etat it just so happened when</text>
  <text start="634.35" dur="4.41">Obama signed the omnibus spending bill</text>
  <text start="636.65" dur="7.809">which was also known as the House</text>
  <text start="638.76" dur="7.23">Resolution 2029 in December the two</text>
  <text start="644.459" dur="11.25">thousand plus page</text>
  <text start="645.99" dur="13.26">law that section disappeared it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="655.709" dur="7.861">have anything in there whatsoever and it</text>
  <text start="659.25" dur="7.13">was very specific that weapons and aid</text>
  <text start="663.57" dur="7.139">could not go to any of these groups and</text>
  <text start="666.38" dur="9.579">right now it&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s no exclusions of</text>
  <text start="670.709" dur="9.241">where the aid can go to and this should</text>
  <text start="675.959" dur="8.25">tell you something this tells you that</text>
  <text start="679.95" dur="8.09">they are funding these groups they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="684.209" dur="7.971">using them once again they&amp;#39;re using them</text>
  <text start="688.04" dur="7.09">for this offensive that is coming up and</text>
  <text start="692.18" dur="6.3">all the evidence that we&amp;#39;ve gathered so</text>
  <text start="695.13" dur="8.41">far points in this direction</text>
  <text start="698.48" dur="9.87">now Turkey is going after academics</text>
  <text start="703.54" dur="6.85">professors teachers and more than 1200</text>
  <text start="708.35" dur="5.76">academics are now being investigated</text>
  <text start="710.39" dur="7.41">inside Turkey for criticizing the</text>
  <text start="714.11" dur="5.97">Turkish state and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="717.8" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;re participating in terrorist</text>
  <text start="720.08" dur="5.66">propaganda after all these academics got</text>
  <text start="723.62" dur="5.19">together and they signed a declaration</text>
  <text start="725.74" dur="6.49">condemning military operations against</text>
  <text start="728.81" dur="7.68">the Kurdish rebels in the southeast of</text>
  <text start="732.23" dur="5.82">the country and around 1200 academics</text>
  <text start="736.49" dur="3.57">from 89 universities sign this</text>
  <text start="738.05" dur="5.31">declaration which was tiled we won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="740.06" dur="7.47">part of this crime and basically what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="743.36" dur="7.56">happening right now is kerwin and his</text>
  <text start="747.53" dur="8.07">group are coming down on these people</text>
  <text start="750.92" dur="9.81">for basically criticising disagreeing</text>
  <text start="755.6" dur="8.28">with the government and showing their</text>
  <text start="760.73" dur="5.97">support by banning together and signing</text>
  <text start="763.88" dur="5.18">a document that&amp;#39;s saying that we won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="766.7" dur="5.97">be part of this crime and how does the</text>
  <text start="769.06" dur="8.25">government react well they call them</text>
  <text start="772.67" dur="8.67">terrorists they call it propaganda they</text>
  <text start="777.31" dur="6.37">detain 12 of the academics the others</text>
  <text start="781.34" dur="4.74">are being investigated and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="783.68" dur="5.58">trying to shut all of these people up</text>
  <text start="786.08" dur="7.28">and this is the scary part about freedom</text>

  <text start="856.01" dur="6.79">now the Russian army they have launched</text>
  <text start="858.63" dur="7.05">a humanitarian airdrop into Syria to</text>
  <text start="862.8" dur="4.43">help the civilian population because</text>
  <text start="865.68" dur="4.08">what they&amp;#39;ve reported is that</text>

  <text start="888.81" dur="5.37">that are supporting the terrorists and</text>
  <text start="891.62" dur="5.59">Russia right now is making sure that the</text>
  <text start="894.18" dur="7.73">aid goes directly to the civilian</text>
  <text start="897.21" dur="8.67">population now the u.s. is continually</text>
  <text start="901.91" dur="7.12">bashing Russia and they&amp;#39;re starting on a</text>
  <text start="905.88" dur="5.52">new propaganda track here and what</text>
  <text start="909.03" dur="4.55">they&amp;#39;re saying is that out of all these</text>
  <text start="911.4" dur="5.94">bombings that Russia is doing in Syria</text>
  <text start="913.58" dur="6.61">they are causing hundreds of civilian</text>
  <text start="917.34" dur="5.4">casualties and the displacement of over</text>
  <text start="920.19" dur="5.43">a hundred thousand residents it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="922.74" dur="4.95">awful but we know they&amp;#39;ve liberated</text>
  <text start="925.62" dur="5.88">hundreds and hundreds of towns and</text>
  <text start="927.69" dur="6.45">cities inside Syria where people were</text>
  <text start="931.5" dur="4.74">cheering and saying thank God because</text>
  <text start="934.14" dur="6.42">the terrorists that were holding us</text>
  <text start="936.24" dur="7.74">captive they were brutal and it was very</text>
  <text start="940.56" dur="6.69">very difficult to live so the question</text>
  <text start="943.98" dur="5.73">is where are they getting this</text>
  <text start="947.25" dur="6.54">information and how are they using this</text>
  <text start="949.71" dur="6.06">propaganda so we&amp;#39;re seeing these reports</text>
  <text start="953.79" dur="5.79">come out and we see it&amp;#39;s coming from the</text>
  <text start="955.77" dur="6.75">US State Department but if you read</text>
  <text start="959.58" dur="5.25">carefully you&amp;#39;ll notice however that it</text>
  <text start="962.52" dur="5.37">not actually Savile civilian casualties</text>
  <text start="964.83" dur="7.59">that are on the rise but rather merely</text>
  <text start="967.89" dur="6.78">reports of them that are increasing by</text>
  <text start="972.42" dur="4.77">examining the nature of both the reports</text>
  <text start="974.67" dur="5.97">and those who are making them we can see</text>
  <text start="977.19" dur="9.6">that the latest media campaign pursued</text>
  <text start="980.64" dur="9.6">by the West is guess what fake because</text>
  <text start="986.79" dur="5.97">the question is who is reporting on this</text>
  <text start="990.24" dur="5.1">and where is the State Department</text>
  <text start="992.76" dur="4.32">getting their information well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="995.34" dur="7.14">getting from the Amnesty International</text>
  <text start="997.08" dur="9.38">and their report section called</text>

  <text start="1050.9" dur="6.51">with the very armed terrorist</text>
  <text start="1052.4" dur="9.18">organization and basically the United</text>

  <text start="1077.57" dur="5.82">they use his information and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1080.96" dur="6.09">seeing right now this is a propaganda</text>
  <text start="1083.39" dur="6.27">trick to convince everyone that Russia</text>
  <text start="1087.05" dur="6.39">is displacing hundreds of thousands of</text>
  <text start="1089.66" dur="5.84">people and killing civilians but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1093.44" dur="5.47">very interesting about all this</text>
  <text start="1095.5" dur="6.72">is that actual reports are coming in</text>
  <text start="1098.91" dur="5.23">showing that the United States has</text>
  <text start="1102.22" dur="4.5">killed civilians now we see what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1104.14" dur="5.94">on in Yemen with Saudi Arabia we know we</text>
  <text start="1106.72" dur="5.88">have the human rights watchdog down</text>
  <text start="1110.08" dur="4.98">there and the UN down there saying yes</text>
  <text start="1112.6" dur="4.32">here is the evidence that Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="1115.06" dur="4.08">purposely bombed this area we know in</text>
  <text start="1116.92" dur="5.04">the United States bombed in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="1119.14" dur="4.8">hospital and here we have reports that</text>
  <text start="1121.96" dur="4.83">at least eight civilians were killed in</text>
  <text start="1123.94" dur="6.27">the u.s. airstrikes targeting the</text>
  <text start="1126.79" dur="7.92">Islamic state the US military looked</text>
  <text start="1130.21" dur="6.33">into it and the US Central Command said</text>
  <text start="1134.71" dur="6.45">it had identified five airstrikes in</text>
  <text start="1136.54" dur="7.44">which yes civilians were killed and they</text>
  <text start="1141.16" dur="7.32">are looking into the others so they were</text>
  <text start="1143.98" dur="7.26">brought real evidence they had a look</text>
  <text start="1148.48" dur="4.95">into it and they found out that yes they</text>
  <text start="1151.24" dur="4.71">did this they have brought no real</text>
  <text start="1153.43" dur="5.7">evidence to Russia</text>
  <text start="1155.95" dur="7.44">so they can research this to see if they</text>
  <text start="1159.13" dur="8.43">actually hit civilians they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="1163.39" dur="6.93">propaganda US Defense Secretary Ashton</text>
  <text start="1167.56" dur="5.4">Carter gave the most extensive account</text>
  <text start="1170.32" dur="6.23">of the Pentagon&amp;#39;s plan to escalate the</text>
  <text start="1172.96" dur="5.72">war in Iraq and Syria they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="1176.55" dur="5.02">preparations we already know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1178.68" dur="6.55">soldiers that are heading towards Iraq</text>
  <text start="1181.57" dur="7.77">and Syria special op teams to basically</text>
  <text start="1185.23" dur="6.09">try to get the Iraqi army off of the</text>
  <text start="1189.34" dur="4.4">Islamic state and let the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1191.32" dur="6.54">either slither out of the country or</text>
  <text start="1193.74" dur="8.71">rebuild them and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="1197.86" dur="6.87">all this is being pushed forward to have</text>
  <text start="1202.45" dur="4.35">a major confrontation in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="1204.73" dur="4.62">we know that the president right now is</text>
  <text start="1206.8" dur="4.29">pushing for the authorization for war we</text>
  <text start="1209.35" dur="5.97">know that Ashton Carter has already said</text>
  <text start="1211.09" dur="6.12">that you know the battle on the the war</text>
  <text start="1215.32" dur="4.11">on the Islamic state is not just in Iraq</text>
