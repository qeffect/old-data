  <text start="47.18" dur="5.969">to look like 2008 and if we go back to</text>
  <text start="49.82" dur="5.46">August of 2008 we see very similar</text>
  <text start="53.149" dur="4.381">things where the stock market is</text>
  <text start="55.28" dur="5.16">continually being pushed up we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>

  <text start="60.44" dur="3.419">thinking of themselves a look</text>
  <text start="61.67" dur="3.69">everything&amp;#39;s starting to look okay but</text>
  <text start="63.859" dur="2.941">when we look through all of this we can</text>
  <text start="65.36" dur="3.36">see that there&amp;#39;s a lot of companies that</text>
  <text start="66.8" dur="4.62">are continually laying off more and more</text>
  <text start="68.72" dur="4.77">people the bank&amp;#39;s financials when we</text>

  <text start="104.18" dur="3.869">happening here things are really</text>
  <text start="105.829" dur="4.801">starting to break apart in the housing</text>
  <text start="108.049" dur="5.401">market we know that Canada in Vancouver</text>
  <text start="110.63" dur="7.94">especially their housing market has been</text>
  <text start="113.45" dur="7.44">one gigantic bubble and back a month ago</text>
  <text start="118.57" dur="4.839">realty companies and real estate boards</text>
  <text start="120.89" dur="4.769">were reporting that deals were falling</text>
  <text start="123.409" dur="3.901">through and we reported on this that</text>
  <text start="125.659" dur="4.411">foreign buyers were forfeiting</text>
  <text start="127.31" dur="4.769">forfeiting their deposits and they were</text>
  <text start="130.07" dur="4.77">saying you know something were out well</text>

  <text start="142.13" dur="3.84">sales in West Vancouver between august</text>
  <text start="144.23" dur="6.72">first and the 14th now if you compare</text>
  <text start="145.97" dur="7.29">this to the to the 52 during the same</text>
  <text start="150.95" dur="5.22">period of last year that&amp;#39;s a decrease of</text>
  <text start="153.26" dur="5.34">ninety-four percent and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="156.17" dur="4.68">seeing is that Vancouver average home</text>
  <text start="158.6" dur="5.25">prices are continually dropping if we</text>
  <text start="160.85" dur="6.9">look at January sixteenth we started out</text>
  <text start="163.85" dur="6.9">around 1.4 million it moved up in March</text>
  <text start="167.75" dur="6.66">to about almost 1.5 million and now it</text>
  <text start="170.75" dur="6.3">has dropped to 1.1 million a huge steep</text>
  <text start="174.41" dur="5.22">decline we see the bubble is popping and</text>
  <text start="177.05" dur="4.14">this is going to spread we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="179.63" dur="3.15">this throughout the United States we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="181.19" dur="3.18">seeing it in the Hamptons we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="182.78" dur="5.16">it in New York we&amp;#39;re seeing it in san</text>
  <text start="184.37" dur="6.18">francisco and this is spreading out in</text>
  <text start="187.94" dur="5.46">ukraine we see there were about a</text>
  <text start="190.55" dur="6">hundred shells and 160 mines launched in</text>
  <text start="193.4" dur="6.66">sudan Minsk and this is continuing we</text>
  <text start="196.55" dur="5.61">also see the wall street journal where</text>
  <text start="200.06" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re saying that Ukraine is out there</text>
  <text start="202.16" dur="4.65">saying that Russia has moved troops onto</text>
  <text start="203.93" dur="5.25">the border and they are ready to</text>
  <text start="206.81" dur="4.83">escalate tensions now this is pure</text>
  <text start="209.18" dur="4.62">propaganda because the Pentagon is out</text>
  <text start="211.64" dur="5.94">there saying that there are absolutely</text>
  <text start="213.8" dur="5.88">no signs at this time that we can report</text>
  <text start="217.58" dur="5.85">where Russia is getting ready to attack</text>
  <text start="219.68" dur="7.2">what they have going on in the entire</text>
  <text start="223.43" dur="6.48">area of Crimea is a drill it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="226.88" dur="6.06">military exercise now of course Russia</text>
  <text start="229.91" dur="5.4">Ukraine is using this for propaganda</text>
  <text start="232.94" dur="4.32">purposes we see the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="235.31" dur="3.9">and the corporate media using this for</text>
  <text start="237.26" dur="3.93">propaganda purposes but the satellite</text>
  <text start="239.21" dur="5.22">information and everything that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="241.19" dur="6.51">on this has been planned and the</text>
  <text start="244.43" dur="5.25">Pentagon realizes that this is all it is</text>
  <text start="247.7" dur="5.04">but we can see there are two things</text>
  <text start="249.68" dur="5.64">happening here we have the corporate</text>
  <text start="252.74" dur="4.619">media the neocons who want more Ukraine</text>
  <text start="255.32" dur="4.65">who wants war and we have the other side</text>
  <text start="257.359" dur="4.801">who&amp;#39;s saying no we don&amp;#39;t see any of this</text>
  <text start="259.97" dur="4.32">and we have no proof of any of it and</text>
  <text start="262.16" dur="4.68">Russia has been in contact with us</text>
  <text start="264.29" dur="6.06">saying that these are military exercises</text>
  <text start="266.84" dur="7.2">and that is all it is but of course what</text>
  <text start="270.35" dur="7.29">we can see is that poroshenko the</text>
  <text start="274.04" dur="7.26">neocons their whole plan right now is to</text>
  <text start="277.64" dur="5.28">push war we see that Russia has placed</text>
  <text start="281.3" dur="4.86">electronic and signals intelligence</text>
  <text start="282.92" dur="6.09">systems on the border of Ukraine near</text>
  <text start="286.16" dur="4.64">Kharkov but it is in Russia now the</text>
  <text start="289.01" dur="3.98">question is why is that they&amp;#39;re well</text>
  <text start="290.8" dur="5.47">this mobile electronic intelligence</text>
  <text start="292.99" dur="4.69">appeared in early August when Ukraine</text>
  <text start="296.27" dur="4.41">has started its provocative</text>
  <text start="297.68" dur="4.799">actions in Crimea and we can see right</text>
  <text start="300.68" dur="4.47">now that Russia is leaving this in this</text>
  <text start="302.479" dur="6.091">area because again we can see that</text>
  <text start="305.15" dur="7.139">Ukraine and the neocons and the elite</text>
  <text start="308.57" dur="7.14">they&amp;#39;re pushing war in this area Biden</text>
  <text start="312.289" dur="6.061">is out there with poroshenko and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="315.71" dur="6.5">discussing what is going on in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="318.35" dur="7.319">the surge in fighting in Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="322.21" dur="6.28">Biden is out there and he sent a message</text>
  <text start="325.669" dur="4.861">to Russia saying that the world is</text>
  <text start="328.49" dur="4.83">watching and underscored the need to</text>
  <text start="330.53" dur="4.88">de-escalate the situation pure</text>
  <text start="333.32" dur="7.29">propaganda and we have to remember</text>
  <text start="335.41" dur="7.75">Biden&amp;#39;s son is involved and on the board</text>
  <text start="340.61" dur="5.79">of directors of the gas companies he was</text>
  <text start="343.16" dur="7.41">placed on the board as soon as the coup</text>
  <text start="346.4" dur="7.32">d&amp;#39;etat was completed and Hunter was put</text>
  <text start="350.57" dur="5.58">into place and now we see Biden is out</text>
  <text start="353.72" dur="5.069">there trying to push the war because</text>
  <text start="356.15" dur="5.04">they have investments there they want</text>
  <text start="358.789" dur="4.711">the gas flowing from Russia through</text>
  <text start="361.19" dur="4.349">Ukraine into Europe they don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="363.5" dur="5.22">Turkish stream so we can see all of this</text>
  <text start="365.539" dur="5.94">is happening at once we see Yemen&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="368.72" dur="6.24">former President Abdullah Saleh saying</text>
  <text start="371.479" dur="6.841">that Russia could use the military bases</text>
  <text start="374.96" dur="5.37">in Yemen to fight terrorism he said in</text>
  <text start="378.32" dur="4.62">the fight against terrorism we reach out</text>
  <text start="380.33" dur="5.16">and offer all facilities our airports</text>
  <text start="382.94" dur="4.56">our ports we are ready to provide this</text>
  <text start="385.49" dur="4.799">to the Russian Federation now we</text>
  <text start="387.5" dur="5.25">understand that he really has no clout</text>
  <text start="390.289" dur="5.16">to implement any of these type of things</text>
  <text start="392.75" dur="4.53">but the party he heads now runs a</text>
  <text start="395.449" dur="3.511">political Council that controls much of</text>
  <text start="397.28" dur="4.859">the country along with the hootie</text>
  <text start="398.96" dur="7.32">movement and coincidentally this took</text>
  <text start="402.139" dur="6.351">place after 48 hours where the US and</text>
  <text start="406.28" dur="7.319">the Pentagon they withdrew their</text>
  <text start="408.49" dur="7.63">personnel from Saudi Arabia and sharply</text>
  <text start="413.599" dur="5.431">reduced the number of staff elsewhere</text>
  <text start="416.12" dur="6.63">who assisting in the planning of the</text>
  <text start="419.03" dur="5.79">saudi-led air campaign in Yemen fewer</text>
  <text start="422.75" dur="5.52">than five US service people are now</text>
  <text start="424.82" dur="6.69">assigned full-time to the joint combined</text>
  <text start="428.27" dur="6.18">planning cell finally well</text>
  <text start="431.51" dur="5.31">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the Yemen pivot</text>
  <text start="434.45" dur="5.64">takes place just five days after China</text>
  <text start="436.82" dur="5.58">appears to have finally joined the Syria</text>
  <text start="440.09" dur="4.56">proxy war announcing that it would</text>
  <text start="442.4" dur="4.89">provide aid and military training to the</text>
  <text start="444.65" dur="7.44">Assad government so is the u.s. right</text>
  <text start="447.29" dur="6.54">now pulling out of the entire area well</text>
  <text start="452.09" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s starting to look that way and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="453.83" dur="4.5">starting to look like it&amp;#39;s moving out of</text>
  <text start="456.47" dur="4.95">certain areas and it looks like we have</text>
  <text start="458.33" dur="4.79">Russia and China moving in and the</text>
  <text start="461.42" dur="4.71">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="463.12" dur="5.08">they are losing the Middle East right</text>
  <text start="466.13" dur="5.25">now and again we have to remember what</text>
  <text start="468.2" dur="6.51">this means the entire system is built on</text>
  <text start="471.38" dur="6.06">the petro dollar system and we can see</text>
  <text start="474.71" dur="4.74">that things are drastically changing now</text>
  <text start="477.44" dur="5.28">in the Middle East and once these</text>
  <text start="479.45" dur="4.83">countries take back their governments</text>
  <text start="482.72" dur="4.11">and kick out the puppet governments and</text>
  <text start="484.28" dur="4.2">decide you know something we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="486.83" dur="5.7">to sell the oil using the dollar and</text>
  <text start="488.48" dur="7.11">this is where the main problem comes in</text>
  <text start="492.53" dur="5.25">because if the United States government</text>
  <text start="495.59" dur="5.82">central bankers allow this to happen</text>
  <text start="497.78" dur="6.69">their system collapses automatically so</text>
  <text start="501.41" dur="8.58">they have two choices let it happen let</text>
  <text start="504.47" dur="7.56">it collapse or start a war and then have</text>
  <text start="509.99" dur="4.77">it collapse after that and I think this</text>
  <text start="512.03" dur="6.3">is where they&amp;#39;re moving right now we see</text>
  <text start="514.76" dur="6.089">out in Turkey there was a suicide attack</text>
  <text start="518.33" dur="4.41">at a wedding party and it looks like at</text>
  <text start="520.849" dur="3.961">least 51 people have been killed with</text>
  <text start="522.74" dur="4.05">another sixty nine wounded the</text>
  <text start="524.81" dur="4.26">government right now in Turkey is saying</text>
  <text start="526.79" dur="4.47">that it is Isis who carried out the</text>
  <text start="529.07" dur="5.01">attacks now very interestingly Isis</text>
  <text start="531.26" dur="4.53">never reports that they attacked anyone</text>
  <text start="534.08" dur="3.81">in Turkey it&amp;#39;s always the government</text>
  <text start="535.79" dur="6.75">saying that it was Isis and we have to</text>
  <text start="537.89" dur="7.2">remember her one his son they support</text>
  <text start="542.54" dur="6.06">the Islamic state they supply the</text>
  <text start="545.09" dur="7.29">weapons they supply aid they helping</text>
  <text start="548.6" dur="7.35">them if they&amp;#39;re wounded and a lot of the</text>
  <text start="552.38" dur="5.19">Islamic state is trained in Turkey so we</text>
  <text start="555.95" dur="3.24">have to watch that situation very very</text>
  <text start="557.57" dur="4.05">carefully even though turkey is moving</text>
  <text start="559.19" dur="4.65">closer to Iran and Russia it still seems</text>
  <text start="561.62" dur="3.62">they&amp;#39;re on the same track where they</text>
  <text start="563.84" dur="3.499">want Assad removed</text>
  <text start="565.24" dur="6.96">that seems like it has not changed at</text>
  <text start="567.339" dur="8.971">all as we reported on Saturday there was</text>
  <text start="572.2" dur="8.25">a very close call between us and Syria</text>
  <text start="576.31" dur="7.649">where Syrian su-24 war planes were</text>
  <text start="580.45" dur="5.61">flying in the area near the Kurds they</text>
  <text start="583.959" dur="4.711">were bombing that area the u.s. said</text>
  <text start="586.06" dur="6.75">they hit the moderate rebels they were</text>
  <text start="588.67" dur="5.97">chased off by warplanes by the United</text>
  <text start="592.81" dur="6.57">States and again we have to say the</text>
  <text start="594.64" dur="7.05">United States they have no reason to be</text>
  <text start="599.38" dur="5.07">in Syria they weren&amp;#39;t invited in there</text>
  <text start="601.69" dur="4.649">they invaded a sovereign country and now</text>
  <text start="604.45" dur="5.78">they&amp;#39;re telling the president of his own</text>
  <text start="606.339" dur="6.541">country that he cannot be in this area</text>
  <text start="610.23" dur="4.84">think about this for a second of what</text>
  <text start="612.88" dur="4.019">the United States has just done they</text>
  <text start="615.07" dur="5.4">have separated this area and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="616.899" dur="5.94">protecting it and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="620.47" dur="5.07">Syrian government well they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="622.839" dur="5.31">listening even though the US has warned</text>
  <text start="625.54" dur="4.169">not to fly in this area the Syrian</text>
  <text start="628.149" dur="4.051">government said well we can fly wherever</text>
  <text start="629.709" dur="5.281">we want this is our country and we will</text>
  <text start="632.2" dur="5.79">fly our jets in this area so they flew</text>
  <text start="634.99" dur="7.83">their jets right into that area in the</text>
  <text start="637.99" dur="7.05">Kurdish held area of Hassakeh and it</text>
  <text start="642.82" dur="4.2">didn&amp;#39;t matter what the u.s. said now we</text>
  <text start="645.04" dur="3.84">can see how this is starting to build up</text>
  <text start="647.02" dur="5.309">now and this is something that we need</text>
  <text start="648.88" dur="5.459">to watch very very carefully right now</text>
  <text start="652.329" dur="4.591">we see the Syrian forces and the Kurdish</text>
  <text start="654.339" dur="5.271">fighters they&amp;#39;ve agreed upon a Russian</text>
  <text start="656.92" dur="4.979">brokered cease-fire in that area and</text>
  <text start="659.61" dur="4.21">we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this plays out</text>
  <text start="661.899" dur="3.031">because what we know is that United</text>
  <text start="663.82" dur="2.88">States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="664.93" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="666.7" dur="6.6">to push war and we see on the other side</text>
  <text start="670.18" dur="4.68">Russia is trying to keep the peace now</text>
  <text start="673.3" dur="4.5">the Turkish Prime Minister was out there</text>
  <text start="674.86" dur="5.099">saying that turkey is ready to play a</text>
  <text start="677.8" dur="4.44">more active role in the region and</text>
  <text start="679.959" dur="4.741">they&amp;#39;re ready to accept that the Syrian</text>
  <text start="682.24" dur="4.23">President Assad may be part of the</text>
  <text start="684.7" dur="4.52">transitional period in the country but</text>
  <text start="686.47" dur="5.4">in the future there is no place for him</text>
  <text start="689.22" dur="4.57">so really they&amp;#39;re doing the same exact</text>
  <text start="691.87" dur="3.06">thing that they&amp;#39;ve done before and it</text>
  <text start="693.79" dur="4.47">doesn&amp;#39;t seem like anything has changed</text>
  <text start="694.93" dur="4.08">there whatsoever we see these Syrian</text>
  <text start="698.26" dur="2.88">rebels</text>
  <text start="699.01" dur="6.33">well they quickly endorsed the rebranded</text>
  <text start="701.14" dur="6.06">nusrah front and as soon as the new</text>
  <text start="705.34" dur="3.6">sewer front no longer call themselves</text>
  <text start="707.2" dur="3.75">the nusrah front because now they&amp;#39;re no</text>
  <text start="708.94" dur="3.96">longer on the UN terrorist watchlist</text>
  <text start="710.95" dur="5.19">watch list this is what the United</text>
  <text start="712.9" dur="6.78">States did as a strategic move all of a</text>
  <text start="716.14" dur="6.96">sudden out of nowhere a huge number of</text>
  <text start="719.68" dur="7.56">soldiers appeared and now this new group</text>
  <text start="723.1" dur="7.14">with this new name is stronger than ever</text>
  <text start="727.24" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re saying this was planned from the</text>
  <text start="730.24" dur="5.49">beginning because we have to remember</text>
  <text start="732.4" dur="5.7">Russia wanted the United States to list</text>
  <text start="735.73" dur="5.04">who were the moderate rebels list who</text>
  <text start="738.1" dur="4.35">with the terrorists now the u.s. decided</text>
  <text start="740.77" dur="4.56">to change the name of their terrorist</text>
  <text start="742.45" dur="4.62">group and they don&amp;#39;t have to list the</text>
  <text start="745.33" dur="3.45">terrorists right now and now they can</text>
  <text start="747.07" dur="3.75">bring in the rest of the soldiers that</text>
  <text start="748.78" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;ve been training in Jordan into the</text>
  <text start="750.82" dur="3.39">mix and they can say these are not</text>
  <text start="752.65" dur="3.96">terrorists now they&amp;#39;re part of the</text>
  <text start="754.21" dur="4.5">moderate rebels and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="756.61" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re doing now very interestingly we</text>
  <text start="758.71" dur="5.58">reported that the u.s. was moving their</text>
  <text start="761.47" dur="4.74">nukes from Turkey to Romania and now</text>
  <text start="764.29" dur="3.87">we&amp;#39;re getting contradictory reports</text>
  <text start="766.21" dur="3.66">regarding the relocation of the US</text>
  <text start="768.16" dur="5.07">nuclear weapons from the Incirlik Air</text>
  <text start="769.87" dur="5.25">Base remember on Monday the Stimson</text>

  <text start="775.12" dur="4.59">think tank they released this report</text>
  <text start="777.07" dur="4.5">urging the policymakers in the u.s. to</text>
  <text start="779.71" dur="3.93">remove these nuclear weapons because</text>
  <text start="781.57" dur="3.51">they were afraid that Turkey was going</text>
  <text start="783.64" dur="4.11">to get them or Terrace were going to get</text>
  <text start="785.08" dur="5.4">them and use them later on so later on</text>
  <text start="787.75" dur="4.8">Thursday August eighteenth your active</text>
  <text start="790.48" dur="4.38">said that the US forces have started an</text>
  <text start="792.55" dur="4.02">operation of relocation of its nuclear</text>
  <text start="794.86" dur="3.93">weapons and they were moving them to</text>
  <text start="796.57" dur="3.72">Romania then the Romanian foreign</text>

  <text start="800.29" dur="5.73">country is going to host the US nuclear</text>
  <text start="802.57" dur="5.78">weapons so right now we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="806.02" dur="6.45">reports that the u.s. is actually not</text>
  <text start="808.35" dur="6.52">moving its nuclear weapons so at this</text>
  <text start="812.47" dur="6.09">moment we&amp;#39;re getting reports that the</text>
  <text start="814.87" dur="5.67">nukes are still in Incirlik Air Base and</text>
  <text start="818.56" dur="3.9">we&amp;#39;ll have to follow up on this to see</text>
  <text start="820.54" dur="4.95">what is happening and we have to</text>
  <text start="822.46" dur="4.98">remember something very important many</text>
  <text start="825.49" dur="5.19">many months ago we reported that there</text>
  <text start="827.44" dur="5.49">was a tactical nuke that was snuck into</text>
  <text start="830.68" dur="5.219">Syria into the aleph</text>
  <text start="832.93" dur="6">region now we know there&amp;#39;s a huge battle</text>
  <text start="835.899" dur="5.041">a huge offensive going on still in that</text>
  <text start="838.93" dur="4.77">area we know the United States does not</text>
  <text start="840.94" dur="4.53">want to lose that entire area and we can</text>
  <text start="843.7" dur="5.22">start to see how this all plays into</text>
  <text start="845.47" dur="6.27">each other where when everything looks</text>
  <text start="848.92" dur="6">like it&amp;#39;s not going in the way the US</text>
  <text start="851.74" dur="7.8">wants we can see the u.s. at that point</text>
  <text start="854.92" dur="7.44">the neocons they might explode one of</text>
  <text start="859.54" dur="5.31">these nukes blame it on a terrorist</text>
  <text start="862.36" dur="5.76">group blame it on turkey blame it on</text>
  <text start="864.85" dur="4.77">anyone where then they can bring in more</text>
  <text start="868.12" dur="3.87">and more troops into this area because</text>
  <text start="869.62" dur="5.88">we can see already that the US has built</text>
  <text start="871.99" dur="5.82">two bases in this curd area we know the</text>
  <text start="875.5" dur="4.8">French have also done the same we see</text>
  <text start="877.81" dur="5.219">the u.s. is trying to protect this area</text>
  <text start="880.3" dur="4.65">keeping Syrian forces out of the area</text>
  <text start="883.029" dur="7.62">keeping Russian forces out of the area</text>
  <text start="884.95" dur="9.72">and they are ready to fire upon or use</text>
  <text start="890.649" dur="6.901">force to keep the forces out of this</text>
  <text start="894.67" dur="4.38">area so this is something that we need</text>
  <text start="897.55" dur="2.76">to watch because we can see that things</text>
  <text start="899.05" dur="5.52">are really starting to heat up in this</text>
  <text start="900.31" dur="7.44">area and the u.s. they are totally</text>
  <text start="904.57" dur="5.94">backed in a corner they have no way out</text>

  <text start="910.51" dur="5.79">decide to leave this area the entire</text>
  <text start="913.42" dur="5.97">system just starts to crumble apart the</text>
  <text start="916.3" dur="6.09">petrodollar would be doomed and the</text>
  <text start="919.39" dur="5.91">entire US economy will completely fall</text>
  <text start="922.39" dur="5.19">apart if they decide to make war they</text>
  <text start="925.3" dur="3.78">can cover this entire thing up doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="927.58" dur="3.509">mean the economy is not going to</text>
  <text start="929.08" dur="3.54">collapse they just have a way of</text>
  <text start="931.089" dur="3.721">pointing their finger at some other</text>
  <text start="932.62" dur="4.38">country or group saying that they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="934.81" dur="3.66">ones who caused it so this is something</text>
  <text start="937" dur="3.95">that we need to watch very very</text>
