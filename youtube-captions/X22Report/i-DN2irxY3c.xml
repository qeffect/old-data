  <text start="33.63" dur="4.98">wanted to report my name is dave and</text>
  <text start="35.43" dur="7.26">this is episode 1075 a and today&amp;#39;s date</text>
  <text start="38.61" dur="6.54">is September 14 2016 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="42.69" dur="4.47">episode is central bankers transition</text>
  <text start="45.15" dur="5.64">into the next currency is almost</text>
  <text start="47.16" dur="6.45">complete let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="50.79" dur="5.519">collapse financial news now today we can</text>
  <text start="53.61" dur="6.47">see the market well it has closed down</text>
  <text start="56.309" dur="7.971">once again gold is up a little bit and</text>
  <text start="60.08" dur="7.51">we can see right now that things are</text>
  <text start="64.28" dur="6.15">rapidly falling apart and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="67.59" dur="5.36">continue in a downward trajectory</text>
  <text start="70.43" dur="4.869">because when we look at all the economic</text>
  <text start="72.95" dur="5.5">indicators the different sectors within</text>
  <text start="75.299" dur="6.091">the economy we see that we&amp;#39;re already in</text>
  <text start="78.45" dur="5.849">a recession a deep recession it&amp;#39;s much</text>
  <text start="81.39" dur="4.74">worse than people even realize i mean if</text>
  <text start="84.299" dur="4.981">you&amp;#39;ve been following what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="86.13" dur="5.91">doing here you understand how bad it is</text>
  <text start="89.28" dur="5.729">out there you might not feel it right</text>
  <text start="92.04" dur="6.05">now just like people really didn&amp;#39;t feel</text>
  <text start="95.009" dur="4.61">it before the market crashed in 2008 but</text>
  <text start="98.09" dur="4.69">everything was falling apart</text>
  <text start="99.619" dur="5.201">corporations were laying off housing</text>
  <text start="102.78" dur="3.81">market was a complete disaster but</text>
  <text start="104.82" dur="4.079">people walk around pretending that</text>
  <text start="106.59" dur="5.4">everything was fine and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="108.899" dur="8.28">they&amp;#39;re doing right now and when that</text>
  <text start="111.99" dur="9.239">last signal crashes people will all of a</text>
  <text start="117.179" dur="8.07">sudden feel it because the illusion will</text>
  <text start="121.229" dur="7.831">become completely gone and we can see</text>
  <text start="125.249" dur="5.641">that things are not as good as the</text>
  <text start="129.06" dur="4.5">government the Fed has been telling us</text>
  <text start="130.89" dur="6.27">they are things are rapidly falling</text>
  <text start="133.56" dur="5.67">apart Corporate America well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="137.16" dur="3.75">speaking up they had a Business</text>
  <text start="139.23" dur="4.29">Roundtable this is a lobbying group</text>
  <text start="140.91" dur="4.53">composed of CEOs of the largest members</text>
  <text start="143.52" dur="4.47">of the corporate America and they</text>
  <text start="145.44" dur="6.33">released their third quarter 2016 CEO</text>
  <text start="147.99" dur="6.9">economic outlook survey and yet remember</text>
  <text start="151.77" dur="6.42">these corporations they employ about 16</text>
  <text start="154.89" dur="5.49">million people and what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="158.19" dur="5.97">is that the overall economy remains</text>
  <text start="160.38" dur="6.36">mired in the unfortunate new normal</text>
  <text start="164.16" dur="5.67">what they&amp;#39;re saying is that the economy</text>
  <text start="166.74" dur="7.77">is failing to live up to its potential</text>
  <text start="169.83" dur="9.42">it is going nowhere and what&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="174.51" dur="8.51">worse is that they&amp;#39;re projecting what</text>
  <text start="179.25" dur="7.11">it&amp;#39;s going to be like moving forward and</text>
  <text start="183.02" dur="6.1">right now they&amp;#39;re seeing an employment</text>
  <text start="186.36" dur="9.06">decline of about three point four points</text>
  <text start="189.12" dur="8.85">and in the future they&amp;#39;re saying it</text>
  <text start="195.42" dur="6.51">looks like we&amp;#39;re going to be letting go</text>
  <text start="197.97" dur="5.22">people now thirty-seven percent say</text>
  <text start="201.93" dur="3.93">there&amp;#39;s going to be no change we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="203.19" dur="5.73">going to let anyone go thirty-six</text>
  <text start="205.86" dur="8.61">percent of them expect to cut their</text>
  <text start="208.92" dur="8.73">payrolls so right now we can see there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="214.47" dur="8.46">going to be a lot more cuts then there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="217.65" dur="6.84">going to be hiring and what we know is</text>
  <text start="222.93" dur="5.99">that we&amp;#39;re already in this deep</text>
  <text start="224.49" dur="6.78">recession and every time corporations</text>
  <text start="228.92" dur="5.17">central banks come out with their</text>
  <text start="231.27" dur="5.64">information they try to make it seem</text>
  <text start="234.09" dur="5.58">like it&amp;#39;s okay but it&amp;#39;s not as bad as it</text>
  <text start="236.91" dur="6.63">really is well they did this right</text>
  <text start="239.67" dur="8.7">before Lehman crashed and went bankrupt</text>
  <text start="243.54" dur="7.68">they this before Bear Stearns AIG before</text>
  <text start="248.37" dur="4.02">2008 crash they try to pretend that</text>
  <text start="251.22" dur="2.22">everything was okay if you have things</text>
  <text start="252.39" dur="4.74">might be getting a little bit worse but</text>
  <text start="253.44" dur="7.26">everything is okay and we can see right</text>
  <text start="257.13" dur="6.48">now that with employment with corporate</text>
  <text start="260.7" dur="6.66">sales they&amp;#39;re all declining it is not</text>
  <text start="263.61" dur="6.87">improving whatsoever we see us import</text>
  <text start="267.36" dur="7.67">prices they have tumbled 25 months in a</text>
  <text start="270.48" dur="9.66">row I mean think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="275.03" dur="10.06">during the Great Recession this tumbled</text>
  <text start="280.14" dur="6.86">for about 15 months we are way past that</text>
  <text start="285.09" dur="6.24">actual if we go back to the 2001</text>
  <text start="287" dur="8.11">recession it was like 17 18 months we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="291.33" dur="5.459">past that already now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="295.11" dur="2.91">following the Baltic Dry Index and a</text>
  <text start="296.789" dur="4.201">ball to join X goes up</text>
  <text start="298.02" dur="6.09">down depending on what what resources</text>
  <text start="300.99" dur="5.399">are needed but we&amp;#39;ve seen we see now</text>
  <text start="304.11" dur="5.339">that the Baltic Dry Index it is fallen</text>
  <text start="306.389" dur="7.53">by 40 points I mean this is a huge drop</text>
  <text start="309.449" dur="7.5">and it brought it down to 756 compared</text>
  <text start="313.919" dur="6.691">to other years where at this point we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="316.949" dur="7.141">normally at 900-1000 and we can see</text>
  <text start="320.61" dur="7.019">right now we&amp;#39;re in a downward trajectory</text>
  <text start="324.09" dur="5.22">in the Baltic Dry Index which shows us</text>
  <text start="327.629" dur="3.361">that manufacturers aren&amp;#39;t going to be</text>
  <text start="329.31" dur="3.359">producing and that shows us that</text>
  <text start="330.99" dur="4.079">manufacturers are going to be shipping</text>
  <text start="332.669" dur="3.87">out goods to retail stores which means</text>
  <text start="335.069" dur="4.59">people are not going to be purchasing</text>
  <text start="336.539" dur="5.551">because if people were purchasing guess</text>
  <text start="339.659" dur="4.021">what there be people there be orders</text>
  <text start="342.09" dur="3.949">coming in to the manufacturers</text>
  <text start="343.68" dur="5.82">manufacturers we need the raw material</text>
  <text start="346.039" dur="6.521">but we&amp;#39;re not seeing any of this now</text>
  <text start="349.5" dur="5.819">last week we heard of this scandal with</text>
  <text start="352.56" dur="4.409">Wells Fargo where employees pumped up</text>
  <text start="355.319" dur="4.681">their paychecks by opening up millions</text>
  <text start="356.969" dur="5.13">of false accounts in real customers</text>
  <text start="360" dur="4.139">names and you know they were charging</text>
  <text start="362.099" dur="5.88">fees late fees and things like that and</text>
  <text start="364.139" dur="7.53">we know that 5,000 people were let go</text>
  <text start="367.979" dur="6.901">because of this one thing that we should</text>
  <text start="371.669" dur="8.72">understand and this reminds me of 2008</text>
  <text start="374.88" dur="8.99">leading up to the crash we&amp;#39;re federal</text>
  <text start="380.389" dur="6.131">examiners they weren&amp;#39;t doing their job</text>
  <text start="383.87" dur="5.019">they didn&amp;#39;t care about what was going on</text>
  <text start="386.52" dur="4.739">in the banking system they what they</text>
  <text start="388.889" dur="6.87">didn&amp;#39;t care about anything that was</text>
  <text start="391.259" dur="7.831">going on anywhere actually and when we</text>
  <text start="395.759" dur="7.621">look at this we can see that these</text>
  <text start="399.09" dur="10.049">individuals well guess what they had no</text>
  <text start="403.38" dur="7.11">idea that this was going on and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="409.139" dur="4.861">very interesting i remember when i was</text>
  <text start="410.49" dur="7.079">working for companies like Merrill Lynch</text>
  <text start="414" dur="5.93">here CREF and many others there was</text>
  <text start="417.569" dur="6.451">always this thing called sarbanes-oxley</text>
  <text start="419.93" dur="5.889">law where you had a sign off every</text>
  <text start="424.02" dur="5.459">department signed off moved up the chain</text>
  <text start="425.819" dur="4.561">up to the CEO and they had a sign off</text>
  <text start="429.479" dur="3.481">that</text>
  <text start="430.38" dur="4.47">they were certifying that everything was</text>
  <text start="432.96" dur="3.99">okay they were following the regulations</text>
  <text start="434.85" dur="5.88">and they knew exactly what was going on</text>
  <text start="436.95" dur="7.59">in their company so we can see the CEO</text>
  <text start="440.73" dur="8.04">and the CFO in Wells Fargo they signed</text>
  <text start="444.54" dur="6.78">this document certifying that the bank</text>
  <text start="448.77" dur="6.23">was had adequate financial and</text>
  <text start="451.32" dur="8.79">operational controls and guess what I</text>
  <text start="455" dur="8.31">guess it didn&amp;#39;t or they just signed it</text>
  <text start="460.11" dur="7.5">and they knew exactly what was going on</text>
  <text start="463.31" dur="7.57">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="467.61" dur="6.87">same thing that went on prior to 2008</text>
  <text start="470.88" dur="5.82">and do you really think this is the</text>
  <text start="474.48" dur="3.9">first bank this is the only bank i</text>
  <text start="476.7" dur="4.05">should say do you really think this is</text>
  <text start="478.38" dur="4.29">the only bank that is doing so like this</text>
  <text start="480.75" dur="7.47">and do you really think this is the only</text>
  <text start="482.67" dur="8.79">thing these banks are doing no we know</text>
  <text start="488.22" dur="8.46">they&amp;#39;re doing a lot of other underhanded</text>
  <text start="491.46" dur="9.66">things to prop up their earnings to prop</text>
  <text start="496.68" dur="8.28">up the bank the banking system I mean</text>
  <text start="501.12" dur="5.22">look what happened prior to 2008 when</text>
  <text start="504.96" dur="4.01">everything started to come crashing down</text>
  <text start="506.34" dur="5.43">we figured out what was really going on</text>
  <text start="508.97" dur="6.819">this is just the first taste of it and</text>
  <text start="511.77" dur="5.49">we can see right now that this economy</text>
  <text start="515.789" dur="4.591">when we look at the economic sectors</text>
  <text start="517.26" dur="5.1">when we look at the banking system when</text>
  <text start="520.38" dur="5.64">we look at what the central bank is</text>
  <text start="522.36" dur="6.81">doing this system is really ripping</text>
  <text start="526.02" dur="5.55">itself apart and the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="529.17" dur="5.67">going to continually pull different</text>
  <text start="531.57" dur="6.63">things out of their sleeves because they</text>
  <text start="534.84" dur="7.14">want their system to continually stay</text>
  <text start="538.2" dur="7.53">above water until they have the ability</text>
  <text start="541.98" dur="7.16">to transition into something else and</text>
  <text start="545.73" dur="6.48">that&amp;#39;s going to require a major event</text>
  <text start="549.14" dur="4.96">but does that mean they collapse is not</text>
  <text start="552.21" dur="4.41">going to come now I believe the collapse</text>
  <text start="554.1" dur="4.68">is deftly going to come think about when</text>
  <text start="556.62" dur="3.48">we came off the gold standard in 1970</text>
  <text start="558.78" dur="3.09">and this is the beginning of a new</text>
  <text start="560.1" dur="4.229">system we were on a system that was</text>
  <text start="561.87" dur="4.909">pretty darn stable and</text>
  <text start="564.329" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;re moving into a system that was</text>
  <text start="566.779" dur="4.6">unstable which was the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="568.649" dur="4.711">system where the central banks were able</text>
  <text start="571.379" dur="4.14">to print as much as they want and that</text>
  <text start="573.36" dur="4.019">system was brand new and there was gas</text>
  <text start="575.519" dur="4.651">shortages there was very high</text>
  <text start="577.379" dur="5.221">unemployment they had to raise the</text>
  <text start="580.17" dur="5.219">interest rates to soak up all the excess</text>
  <text start="582.6" dur="5.429">dollars and we can see it took a little</text>
  <text start="585.389" dur="4.2">while for things to stabilize and that</text>
  <text start="588.029" dur="3.331">one that is when we were transitioning</text>
  <text start="589.589" dur="5.99">into a new system from a stable system</text>
  <text start="591.36" dur="8.729">we&amp;#39;re transitioning into a new system</text>
  <text start="595.579" dur="7.901">from a system that is a complete</text>
  <text start="600.089" dur="7.891">disaster trillions and trillions worth</text>
  <text start="603.48" dur="9.659">of debt derivative bubble stock market</text>
  <text start="607.98" dur="8.579">bubble banks are insolvent people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="613.139" dur="7.32">have work right now it&amp;#39;s much much worse</text>
  <text start="616.559" dur="8.161">right now I mean look at Venezuela their</text>
  <text start="620.459" dur="7.081">system is completely crashing now we</text>
  <text start="624.72" dur="4.679">know the reason why a lot of this is</text>
  <text start="627.54" dur="3.149">happening is Venezuela because the</text>
  <text start="629.399" dur="3.12">United States is putting a lot of</text>
  <text start="630.689" dur="5.851">pressure on Venezuela and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="632.519" dur="7.68">actually crashing their economy but last</text>
  <text start="636.54" dur="7.62">reported a dozen eggs cost a hundred and</text>
  <text start="640.199" dur="6.031">fifty dollars and they&amp;#39;re expecting</text>
  <text start="644.16" dur="5.099">their inflation to go to seven hundred</text>
  <text start="646.23" dur="6.06">and twenty percent seventy-five percent</text>
  <text start="649.259" dur="6.75">of Venezuelans they&amp;#39;re suffering right</text>
  <text start="652.29" dur="7.589">now of from extreme poverty so just</text>
  <text start="656.009" dur="6.48">think about this because most likely</text>
  <text start="659.879" dur="8.82">this type of scenario is coming to the</text>
  <text start="662.489" dur="9.121">US now yesterday we reported on Obama</text>
  <text start="668.699" dur="6.961">where he was going to the World Trade</text>
  <text start="671.61" dur="9.689">Organization and he was filing a motion</text>
  <text start="675.66" dur="8.969">saying that China was upping their</text>
  <text start="681.299" dur="5.85">prices on crops and you know fixing</text>
  <text start="684.629" dur="5.52">prices and things like that China came</text>
  <text start="687.149" dur="4.91">back and says they denied that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="690.149" dur="6.651">violating the World Trade Organization</text>
  <text start="692.059" dur="7.141">rules and they&amp;#39;re ready to fight Obama</text>
  <text start="696.8" dur="5.37">on this and we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="699.2" dur="5.579">u.s. is just lashing out in every</text>
  <text start="702.17" dur="5.72">direction because we know why countries</text>
  <text start="704.779" dur="5.641">are not accepting our crops because</text>
  <text start="707.89" dur="7.18">they&amp;#39;re genetically altered and</text>
  <text start="710.42" dur="8.25">countries do not want this food Marc</text>
  <text start="715.07" dur="6.269">Faber is out there and he is saying and</text>
  <text start="718.67" dur="6.09">some people say it&amp;#39;s Marc Faber however</text>
  <text start="721.339" dur="5.94">you want to pronounce it there&amp;#39;s he is</text>
  <text start="724.76" dur="5.519">saying that the central bank could</text>
  <text start="727.279" dur="7.141">essentially monetize everything em we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="730.279" dur="6.151">talked about this before Louis cammisano</text>
  <text start="734.42" dur="4.53">on an interview that we just did we</text>
  <text start="736.43" dur="4.649">talked about how the central bank will</text>
  <text start="738.95" dur="5.43">have full control remember they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="741.079" dur="5.641">want to give up their power they will do</text>
  <text start="744.38" dur="5.97">everything they possibly can to keep the</text>
  <text start="746.72" dur="7.32">system alive because what I think is</text>
  <text start="750.35" dur="6.54">going to happen here is the system is</text>
  <text start="754.04" dur="5.82">getting ready to collapse they want to</text>
  <text start="756.89" dur="7.02">bring it down in their way but they need</text>
  <text start="759.86" dur="5.55">a story to blame this collapse on so</text>
  <text start="763.91" dur="4.26">they need some type of an event and</text>
  <text start="765.41" dur="4.799">usually it&amp;#39;s war something happens we</text>
  <text start="768.17" dur="5.729">got to go to war yes the economy is</text>
  <text start="770.209" dur="5.581">awful everyone has to sacrifice because</text>
  <text start="773.899" dur="5.851">look what this other country or group</text>
  <text start="775.79" dur="6.21">did to this country after the war they</text>
  <text start="779.75" dur="4.41">want to transition into another system</text>
  <text start="782" dur="3.47">now it&amp;#39;s a system that they want it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="784.16" dur="4.35">not a system that the people want</text>
  <text start="785.47" dur="8.22">because they want to restart this entire</text>
  <text start="788.51" dur="7.38">thing again and we talk about blockchain</text>
  <text start="793.69" dur="5.649">currency and i&amp;#39;m not talking about</text>
  <text start="795.89" dur="5.759">bitcoin and i looked into this now and I</text>
  <text start="799.339" dur="5.131">discuss this with a dex the Vulcan on</text>
  <text start="801.649" dur="6.111">one of the interviews I also talked to a</text>
  <text start="804.47" dur="6.27">Lewis cammisano about the blockchain and</text>
  <text start="807.76" dur="7.829">yes this is the direction they are</text>
  <text start="810.74" dur="7.68">moving most likely the next currency</text>
  <text start="815.589" dur="5.711">will probably be digital and the reason</text>
  <text start="818.42" dur="5.46">why I say this is because the is because</text>
  <text start="821.3" dur="4.89">the US House of Representatives they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="823.88" dur="5.04">passed a non-binding resolution that</text>
  <text start="826.19" dur="4.309">highlights the positive potential impact</text>
  <text start="828.92" dur="6.469">for digital currencies</text>
  <text start="830.499" dur="8.85">a blockchain technology that could be</text>
  <text start="835.389" dur="5.37">used here in the US now the resolution</text>
  <text start="839.349" dur="3.81">which calls on the US government to</text>
  <text start="840.759" dur="5.01">establish a national policy for</text>
  <text start="843.159" dur="5.25">technology it was submitted to the house</text>
  <text start="845.769" dur="6.78">of representative in July and passed on</text>
  <text start="848.409" dur="6.6">Monday now the aim of this is to</text>
  <text start="852.549" dur="5.01">increase financial inclusion and the use</text>
  <text start="855.009" dur="5.31">of e-commerce to promote consumer</text>
  <text start="857.559" dur="4.8">empowerment it specifically identifies</text>
  <text start="860.319" dur="3.87">digital currency and blockchain</text>
  <text start="862.359" dur="5.73">technology as a way to potentially</text>
  <text start="864.189" dur="5.64">achieve that goal now the resolution is</text>
  <text start="868.089" dur="6.15">not binding right now it&amp;#39;s the first</text>
  <text start="869.829" dur="6.18">step but it does signal support for</text>
  <text start="874.239" dur="5.13">digital currencies and blockchain</text>
  <text start="876.009" dur="6.36">technologies in the house the next stage</text>
  <text start="879.369" dur="4.92">would be for a detailed bill which</text>
  <text start="882.369" dur="4.74">focuses completely on blockchain and</text>
  <text start="884.289" dur="4.44">digital currencies and they need to put</text>
  <text start="887.109" dur="5.25">this to the house and to the Senate and</text>
  <text start="888.729" dur="6.87">vote on it now if this is passed it</text>
  <text start="892.359" dur="6.41">could spark governmental central banks</text>
  <text start="895.599" dur="8.19">to create a national regulatory</text>
  <text start="898.769" dur="6.97">environment for blockchain technology so</text>
  <text start="903.789" dur="4.14">you can see where they&amp;#39;re headed with</text>
  <text start="905.739" dur="4.35">this now blockchain technology it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="907.929" dur="4.5">going to be centralized the central bank</text>
  <text start="910.089" dur="5.37">will control and we can see why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="912.429" dur="5.7">talking about a cashless society because</text>
  <text start="915.459" dur="6.03">this way they have full control of what</text>
  <text start="918.129" dur="5.46">you do they don&amp;#39;t want you to take out</text>
  <text start="921.489" dur="6.36">money boom they throw a switch they</text>
  <text start="923.589" dur="6.29">track your purchases they know how much</text>
  <text start="927.849" dur="6.03">you spent how much you&amp;#39;ve earned it</text>
  <text start="929.879" dur="10.27">would be very difficult to hide anything</text>
  <text start="933.879" dur="10.23">from them plus they&amp;#39;ll always know what</text>
  <text start="940.149" dur="6.18">you&amp;#39;re doing and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="944.109" dur="4.83">this is where they want to go because</text>
  <text start="946.329" dur="6.36">they&amp;#39;re nervous that if there is some</text>
  <text start="948.939" dur="5.13">type of financial problems they</text>
  <text start="952.689" dur="3.9">understand that people will run to the</text>
  <text start="954.069" dur="4.62">banks and take their cash out if they</text>
  <text start="956.589" dur="5.64">have this system in place there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="958.689" dur="5.4">nothing to take out they can do what</text>
  <text start="962.229" dur="4.65">they want with your money</text>
  <text start="964.089" dur="5.49">they control everything and this is the</text>
  <text start="966.879" dur="4.981">point they want to control all of this</text>
  <text start="969.579" dur="4.17">but I do believe that we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="971.86" dur="4.05">going through this transition to get to</text>
  <text start="973.749" dur="4.351">it because they just can&amp;#39;t pop it on the</text>
  <text start="975.91" dur="3.659">people and say hey tomorrow we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="978.1" dur="2.82">going to stop we&amp;#39;re going to just start</text>
  <text start="979.569" dur="3.39">blockchain we can get rid of the dollar</text>
  <text start="980.92" dur="3.87">because people are going to go why do we</text>
  <text start="982.959" dur="4.201">have to do that why is the government</text>
  <text start="984.79" dur="5.01">telling us we need to do this but after</text>
  <text start="987.16" dur="5.25">some type of war or an event or</text>
  <text start="989.8" dur="5.25">something like that to say oh we went</text>
  <text start="992.41" dur="4.95">through this the other economic system</text>
  <text start="995.05" dur="4.05">was completely destroyed we need to</text>
  <text start="997.36" dur="4.74">restart it I mean we did this back in</text>
  <text start="999.1" dur="7.32">World War two it was a whole brand new</text>
  <text start="1002.1" dur="6.39">system they made up an entire story to</text>
  <text start="1006.42" dur="4.44">come off the gold standard and then in</text>
  <text start="1008.49" dur="4.409">the 70s but this time it&amp;#39;s much much</text>
  <text start="1010.86" dur="5.19">worse we have a huge amount of debt we</text>
  <text start="1012.899" dur="5.1">have a huge derivative problem and the</text>
  <text start="1016.05" dur="4.8">system is rapidly falling apart and</text>
  <text start="1017.999" dur="5.221">they&amp;#39;re running out of time and we can</text>
  <text start="1020.85" dur="7.229">see this is the direction we are moving</text>
  <text start="1023.22" dur="7.89">in this is the transition they want now</text>
  <text start="1028.079" dur="6.33">the question is is this what the people</text>
  <text start="1031.11" dur="6.929">want do we want the central banks to</text>
  <text start="1034.409" dur="6.451">dictate what our currency is going to be</text>
  <text start="1038.039" dur="5.221">I don&amp;#39;t think we should give them that</text>
  <text start="1040.86" dur="4.679">power I think we should take that power</text>
  <text start="1043.26" dur="4.529">back listen everyone thanks a lot for</text>
