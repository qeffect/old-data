  <text start="78.68" dur="5.52">Intel agencies have been spying on the</text>
  <text start="81.53" dur="4.68">American people and of course the</text>
  <text start="84.2" dur="6.38">corporate media never really picked this</text>
  <text start="86.21" dur="7.74">up and we knew that the NSA CIA the FBI</text>
  <text start="90.58" dur="5.399">they all had ways of spying on the</text>
  <text start="93.95" dur="4.949">American people and with WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="95.979" dur="4.78">dropping the bomb a vault seven we</text>
  <text start="98.899" dur="5.131">started to figure out a lot of the</text>
  <text start="100.759" dur="6.301">information and just recently we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="104.03" dur="5.04">gotten some more information and these</text>
  <text start="107.06" dur="4.02">secrets they&amp;#39;re hidden behind fortified</text>
  <text start="109.07" dur="6.719">walls in cities across the United States</text>
  <text start="111.08" dur="7.17">inside towering windowless skyscrapers</text>
  <text start="115.789" dur="4.291">and fortress like concrete structures</text>
  <text start="118.25" dur="6.15">that were built to withstand earthquakes</text>
  <text start="120.08" dur="7.219">and even nuclear tax thousands of people</text>
  <text start="124.4" dur="5.999">passed by these buildings each day and</text>
  <text start="127.299" dur="5.131">really give them a second glance because</text>
  <text start="130.399" dur="4.65">their function is not publicly known</text>
  <text start="132.43" dur="4.809">they are an integral part of the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="135.049" dur="5.731">largest telecommunications network and</text>
  <text start="137.239" dur="6.321">they are also linked to the National</text>

  <text start="159.739" dur="5.22">Internet traffic across the United</text>
  <text start="161.87" dur="6.05">States and the world a body of evidence</text>
  <text start="164.959" dur="5.221">including classified NSA documents</text>
  <text start="167.92" dur="5.56">public records and interviews with</text>
  <text start="170.18" dur="7.14">several former AT&amp;amp;T employees indicates</text>
  <text start="173.48" dur="7.59">that the buildings are central to an NSA</text>
  <text start="177.32" dur="6.84">spying initiative that has for years</text>
  <text start="181.07" dur="5.499">monitored billions of emails phone calls</text>
  <text start="184.16" dur="5.74">and online chats</text>
  <text start="186.569" dur="7.411">across u.s. territory now according to</text>
  <text start="189.9" dur="6">the NSA&amp;#39;s documents it values AT&amp;amp;T not</text>
  <text start="193.98" dur="4.17">only because it has access to</text>
  <text start="195.9" dur="4.949">information that trends that transits</text>
  <text start="198.15" dur="5.64">the nation but also because it maintains</text>
  <text start="200.849" dur="6.12">unique relationship with other phone and</text>
  <text start="203.79" dur="5.55">internet providers the NSA exploits</text>
  <text start="206.969" dur="5.55">these relationships for surveillance</text>
  <text start="209.34" dur="5.34">purposes commandeering ATT&amp;#39;s massive</text>
  <text start="212.519" dur="4.291">infrastructure and using it as a</text>
  <text start="214.68" dur="4.86">platform to covertly tap into</text>
  <text start="216.81" dur="6.81">communications process by other</text>
  <text start="219.54" dur="5.819">companies so all those stories and</text>
  <text start="223.62" dur="5.25">everything but we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on</text>
  <text start="225.359" dur="6.84">saying that the NSA is spying on the</text>
  <text start="228.87" dur="5.489">emails on phone calls on everything well</text>
  <text start="232.199" dur="4.801">it looks like it&amp;#39;s all coming true and</text>
  <text start="234.359" dur="5.25">from these documents we can see that</text>
  <text start="237" dur="7.159">this is what they&amp;#39;ve been doing so once</text>
  <text start="239.609" dur="7.38">again here it is the truth is coming out</text>
  <text start="244.159" dur="6.45">now I just want to go back to the script</text>
  <text start="246.989" dur="6.71">Ori Sergei scribble out in the UK and</text>
  <text start="250.609" dur="7.391">what&amp;#39;s very interesting out there and</text>
  <text start="253.699" dur="8.32">this is according to officials taxpayers</text>
  <text start="258" dur="7.919">will be footing the bill for scruples</text>
  <text start="262.019" dur="10.64">home now the UK government is going to</text>
  <text start="265.919" dur="9.75">purchase scruples home for 350,000 and</text>
  <text start="272.659" dur="5.621">they&amp;#39;re also going to purchase Detective</text>
  <text start="275.669" dur="5.271">Sergeant Nick Bailey he&amp;#39;s the one who</text>
  <text start="278.28" dur="7.02">fell ill after coming into contact with</text>
  <text start="280.94" dur="7.03">the nerve agent Nova Chuck which has</text>
  <text start="285.3" dur="6.6">never been proven and the house is</text>
  <text start="287.97" dur="6.569">expected to cost taxpayers around 430 so</text>
  <text start="291.9" dur="6.81">basically almost a million is going to</text>
  <text start="294.539" dur="7.231">be spent on purchasing these homes now</text>
  <text start="298.71" dur="5.28">the question is why why do they need to</text>
  <text start="301.77" dur="3.829">purchase these homes because I think</text>
  <text start="303.99" dur="4.08">what&amp;#39;s going to happen eventually is</text>
  <text start="305.599" dur="3.701">they&amp;#39;re going to be demolished they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="308.07" dur="3">going to be destroyed and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="309.3" dur="3.69">to make the excuse they have to do this</text>
  <text start="311.07" dur="3.629">because they can&amp;#39;t get the poison under</text>
  <text start="312.99" dur="4.26">the house we don&amp;#39;t want anyone else to</text>
  <text start="314.699" dur="5.371">be infected and most likely they&amp;#39;ll end</text>
  <text start="317.25" dur="4.92">up destroying it and if you notice</text>
  <text start="320.07" dur="5.73">other places have been destroyed also</text>
  <text start="322.17" dur="6.15">when we see these type of events this is</text>
  <text start="325.8" dur="4.29">how they get rid of everything and it</text>
  <text start="328.32" dur="5.25">seems like this is the direction they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="330.09" dur="6.69">going in we see that Merkel well she is</text>
  <text start="333.57" dur="4.77">in trouble she was stunned after the</text>
  <text start="336.78" dur="5.03">Italian Prime Minister called for</text>
  <text start="338.34" dur="6.54">radical change in the EU so-called</text>
  <text start="341.81" dur="6.01">Dublin principle that makes frontline</text>
  <text start="344.88" dur="5.07">countries such as Italy responsible for</text>
  <text start="347.82" dur="4.32">dealing with asylum claims and allows</text>
  <text start="349.95" dur="4.56">for registered asylum seekers that move</text>
  <text start="352.14" dur="5.7">on to another country to be set back to</text>
  <text start="354.51" dur="5.58">the state they landed in now Conte he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="357.84" dur="6.45">calling for severing the link between</text>
  <text start="360.09" dur="7.53">the safe port of disembarkation and the</text>
  <text start="364.29" dur="6.75">competency to examine asylum rights the</text>
  <text start="367.62" dur="6.48">reason why simple Italy along with the</text>
  <text start="371.04" dur="5.64">other European nations tend to be on the</text>
  <text start="374.1" dur="5.55">short end of the trade as Rome ends up</text>
  <text start="376.68" dur="5.9">with any migrants that cross the</text>
  <text start="379.65" dur="5.61">Mediterranean to arrive in Italy and</text>
  <text start="382.58" dur="3.07">Merkel got even more bad news from all</text>
  <text start="385.26" dur="4.17">this</text>
  <text start="385.65" dur="6.18">Conte also proposed the protection</text>
  <text start="389.43" dur="5.34">centers for processing asylum claims</text>
  <text start="391.83" dur="6.3">should be set up in other EU countries</text>
  <text start="394.77" dur="5.37">such as Germany as hotspots to avoid</text>
  <text start="398.13" dur="5.1">overcrowding in frontline states such as</text>
  <text start="400.14" dur="4.5">Italy France and Spain have backed a</text>
  <text start="403.23" dur="4.23">similar plan but the idea has been</text>
  <text start="404.64" dur="5.22">criticised by the Netherlands in other</text>
  <text start="407.46" dur="6.03">words migrants picked up from Libya</text>
  <text start="409.86" dur="5.55">would be processed in Libya and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="413.49" dur="4.8">have to see how Merkel reacts to this</text>
  <text start="415.41" dur="4.98">and Italy now is fighting back</text>
  <text start="418.29" dur="4.59">many of the nations now are fighting</text>
  <text start="420.39" dur="5.55">back because they don&amp;#39;t want this open</text>
  <text start="422.88" dur="5.94">border and many of the countries are</text>
  <text start="425.94" dur="6.06">putting up you know temporary fences</text>
  <text start="428.82" dur="5.79">walls to keep these individuals that now</text>
  <text start="432" dur="6.24">remember this was all being planned by</text>
  <text start="434.61" dur="5.85">Soros and the globalist the deep state</text>
  <text start="438.24" dur="5.34">where they were going to blend the world</text>
  <text start="440.46" dur="5.55">and become one where you couldn&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="443.58" dur="6.63">one nation from another this was all</text>
  <text start="446.01" dur="6.03">part of their one-world strategy where</text>
  <text start="450.21" dur="3.519">they&amp;#39;re going to have the world on an</text>
  <text start="452.04" dur="4.059">even playing field and</text>
  <text start="453.729" dur="5.731">I think they&amp;#39;re still trying to do this</text>
  <text start="456.099" dur="6.451">remember the deep state they don&amp;#39;t give</text>
  <text start="459.46" dur="5.069">up if their goal isn&amp;#39;t met with this</text>
  <text start="462.55" dur="4.339">plan they shift to a different plane</text>
  <text start="464.529" dur="5.01">this is why Soros is down now in Africa</text>
  <text start="466.889" dur="4.45">looking to get refugees to come up into</text>
  <text start="469.539" dur="4.62">Europe because the Middle Eastern</text>
  <text start="471.339" dur="4.55">refugees well they&amp;#39;re returning to their</text>
  <text start="474.159" dur="4.62">countries so he can&amp;#39;t use them anymore</text>
  <text start="475.889" dur="5.17">the wars are coming to an end in the</text>
  <text start="478.779" dur="5.07">Middle Eastern country so they can&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="481.059" dur="5.431">these individuals now they have to shift</text>
  <text start="483.849" dur="5.97">their focus and try to readjust their</text>
  <text start="486.49" dur="5.31">plan to bring other refugees into Europe</text>
  <text start="489.819" dur="4.68">and it looks like they&amp;#39;re having a very</text>
  <text start="491.8" dur="5.82">difficult time and it&amp;#39;s all starting to</text>
  <text start="494.499" dur="5.521">break down we see the Pentagon announced</text>
  <text start="497.62" dur="6.269">on Friday that they basically</text>
  <text start="500.02" dur="7.859">indefinitely suspended all the war games</text>
  <text start="503.889" dur="5.7">in South Korea and this is even</text>
  <text start="507.879" dur="5.671">including the freedom the freedom</text>
  <text start="509.589" dur="6.51">Guardian exercise which happens annually</text>
  <text start="513.55" dur="4.919">this is also being shut down right now</text>
  <text start="516.099" dur="6.151">we also see the Pentagon is sending</text>
  <text start="518.469" dur="6.691">coffins flags to the DMZ to receive the</text>
  <text start="522.25" dur="5.579">war remains from North Korea so this is</text>
  <text start="525.16" dur="5.789">all true here and we also see out in</text>
  <text start="527.829" dur="6.06">South Sudan peace talks have been kicked</text>
  <text start="530.949" dur="6">off by the South Sudanese president and</text>
  <text start="533.889" dur="5.521">the opposition leader and we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="536.949" dur="4.411">these talks before and but the problem</text>
  <text start="539.41" dur="4.83">was the deeps thought the deep state was</text>
  <text start="541.36" dur="5.31">involved in these peace talks John Kerry</text>
  <text start="544.24" dur="4.349">normally would be involved in this and</text>
  <text start="546.67" dur="3.659">whenever they talk about peace talks</text>
  <text start="548.589" dur="3.48">when the deep state was involved there</text>
  <text start="550.329" dur="5.31">was never about peace talks it was about</text>
  <text start="552.069" dur="6.63">one side surrendering and there was no</text>
  <text start="555.639" dur="5.611">other option just like in Ukraine put</text>
  <text start="558.699" dur="4.741">down your weapons we will take over that</text>
  <text start="561.25" dur="4.98">area that was the peace talks</text>

  <text start="566.23" dur="5.549">be president or replace you those were</text>
  <text start="569.26" dur="4.74">the peace talks so it&amp;#39;s almost like a</text>
  <text start="571.779" dur="3.841">Sith have you ever seen Star Wars where</text>
  <text start="574" dur="4.459">everything is black and white there&amp;#39;s no</text>

  <text start="754.7" dur="7.48">reconciliation he said it succeeded this</text>
  <text start="759.27" dur="5.04">is how we could have brought those areas</text>
  <text start="762.18" dur="3.78">back to their normal T where the people</text>
  <text start="764.31" dur="2.76">live a normal life and the government is</text>

  <text start="770.52" dur="4.32">is attacking the attack terrorists</text>
  <text start="772.89" dur="4.29">whenever they don&amp;#39;t give up and join the</text>
  <text start="774.84" dur="5.28">reconciliation we&amp;#39;re going to attack</text>
  <text start="777.18" dur="5.97">them and take control by force which is</text>
  <text start="780.12" dur="4.71">not our favorable way but is the only</text>
  <text start="783.15" dur="5.28">way to gain control of the country if</text>
  <text start="784.83" dur="4.98">they don&amp;#39;t use the first method and I</text>
  <text start="788.43" dur="3.42">think most of the terrorists right now</text>
  <text start="789.81" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re using the first method because</text>
  <text start="791.85" dur="4.23">they realize the support from the US</text>
  <text start="794.55" dur="3.36">from the deep state well the deep state</text>
  <text start="796.08" dur="4.2">is being pushed out and the US</text>

  <text start="817.65" dur="5.43">realize they have no other choice so at</text>
  <text start="820.23" dur="4.53">this point we can see that Assad when he</text>
  <text start="823.08" dur="4.62">says he&amp;#39;s going to be taking back his</text>
  <text start="824.76" dur="5.16">country he will be because the u.s. is</text>

  <text start="986.73" dur="4.289">is going to happen here now it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="989.49" dur="4.2">interesting a lot of people say well how</text>
  <text start="991.019" dur="4.711">come Barack Obama is not nervous why is</text>
  <text start="993.69" dur="6.11">he still traveling the world well he was</text>

  <text start="999.8" dur="6.219">together he calls it the international</text>
  <text start="1003.26" dur="4.769">order but what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="1006.019" dur="3.241">all of this is you can tell that Obama</text>
  <text start="1008.029" dur="1.851">is getting a little bit nervous right</text>

  <text start="1040.85" dur="5.52">what worries him and as the world order</text>
  <text start="1044.03" dur="4.11">remember Obama was following him around</text>

  <text start="1100.46" dur="5.76">gonna be cancelling the nuclear deal</text>

  <text start="1106.22" dur="3.06">right now</text>
  <text start="1106.64" dur="5.88">and a lot of these countries are looking</text>

  <text start="1242.12" dur="4.89">everything is being ripped apart</text>
