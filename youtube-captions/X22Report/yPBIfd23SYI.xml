  <text start="76.17" dur="5.91">nervous about this crypto currency</text>
  <text start="78.899" dur="5.641">market and we&amp;#39;ve talked about this in</text>
  <text start="82.08" dur="6.69">other reports where we said they could</text>
  <text start="84.54" dur="6.45">dump a lot of cryptocurrency to make it</text>
  <text start="88.77" dur="4.65">look like the crypto market is very</text>
  <text start="90.99" dur="4.56">volatile and we said they could purchase</text>
  <text start="93.42" dur="4.949">it or they might use some type of method</text>
  <text start="95.55" dur="4.879">where they have a lot of Bitcoin or any</text>
  <text start="98.369" dur="5.191">other type of coin and they dump it and</text>
  <text start="100.429" dur="4.901">basically bring down the price I had an</text>
  <text start="103.56" dur="3.509">interview a while back with Jeff Nielsen</text>
  <text start="105.33" dur="3.51">who said the same exact thing where the</text>
  <text start="107.069" dur="4.321">central bank they could just print a lot</text>
  <text start="108.84" dur="5.069">of money you buy up a lot of Bitcoin and</text>
  <text start="111.39" dur="4.83">then wait for the right moment and then</text>
  <text start="113.909" dur="4.171">bring it down pump it right up bring it</text>
  <text start="116.22" dur="4.92">right down I mean the central bankers</text>
  <text start="118.08" dur="7.349">they&amp;#39;re experts at this now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="121.14" dur="6.929">seeing that the mount GOx the hoard of</text>
  <text start="125.429" dur="6.001">bitcoins that was produced by that</text>
  <text start="128.069" dur="6.841">they&amp;#39;ve been dumping this we also see</text>
  <text start="131.43" dur="5.85">there was a single Bitcoin whale who</text>
  <text start="134.91" dur="6.39">unloaded 50 million worth of the digital</text>
  <text start="137.28" dur="6.03">currency in one BitFenix trade now the</text>
  <text start="141.3" dur="5.1">drop comes one day after the third</text>
  <text start="143.31" dur="5.13">largest Bitcoin wallet also unloaded</text>
  <text start="146.4" dur="4.47">around 50 million of the digital</text>
  <text start="148.44" dur="5.31">currency so what they&amp;#39;ve done is they</text>
  <text start="150.87" dur="7.199">brought the price down and basically</text>
  <text start="153.75" dur="7.489">they let go about 6600 bitcoins at an</text>
  <text start="158.069" dur="6">average price of about 8,000 26 and</text>
  <text start="161.239" dur="5.291">basically when you combine the two it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="164.069" dur="6.091">about a hundred million dollars worth of</text>
  <text start="166.53" dur="5.16">Bitcoin that was dumped in 24 hours now</text>
  <text start="170.16" dur="3.689">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this is</text>
  <text start="171.69" dur="4.23">that New York Attorney General Eric</text>
  <text start="173.849" dur="4.441">Schneiderman launched an investigation</text>
  <text start="175.92" dur="6.03">into 13 cryptocurrency exchanges</text>
  <text start="178.29" dur="5.94">including coinbase Gemini bit trust and</text>
  <text start="181.95" dur="4.17">the probe seeks information on fees</text>
  <text start="184.23" dur="4.35">volume dater</text>
  <text start="186.12" dur="6.179">governing margin trading among other</text>
  <text start="188.58" dur="7.89">things and the news hit some four hours</text>
  <text start="192.299" dur="6">prior to the sale now the news came out</text>
  <text start="196.47" dur="3.599">they were looking into this they made</text>
  <text start="198.299" dur="4.53">the sale making it look very volatile</text>
  <text start="200.069" dur="7.801">and then christine lagarde comes out and</text>
  <text start="202.829" dur="7.77">says that crypto currencies well we need</text>
  <text start="207.87" dur="6.509">to have regulation there needs to be and</text>
  <text start="210.599" dur="6.991">we should require regulations in the</text>
  <text start="214.379" dur="7.47">crypto space so it looks like they are</text>
  <text start="217.59" dur="6.42">pushing to control the crypto market and</text>
  <text start="221.849" dur="5.491">have government&amp;#39;s step in create</text>
  <text start="224.01" dur="6.18">regulations and basically control the</text>
  <text start="227.34" dur="5.55">entire market remember the central</text>
  <text start="230.19" dur="5.969">bankers if they can get the governments</text>
  <text start="232.89" dur="6.33">to cooperate and place these regulations</text>
  <text start="236.159" dur="5.011">to basically say and in the regulation</text>
  <text start="239.22" dur="4.079">could say these are not currencies these</text>
  <text start="241.17" dur="4.379">are commodities these you know have to</text>
  <text start="243.299" dur="4.05">be traded in this way you can&amp;#39;t use them</text>
  <text start="245.549" dur="4.261">to purchase I mean this is really what</text>
  <text start="247.349" dur="4.351">they want in the end now what we see is</text>
  <text start="249.81" dur="4.019">that this market is very volatile today</text>
  <text start="251.7" dur="4.259">the central bankers are pushing their</text>
  <text start="253.829" dur="4.921">agenda they&amp;#39;re making it seem like you</text>
  <text start="255.959" dur="4.89">shouldn&amp;#39;t own this and really what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="258.75" dur="4.41">happening is that more and more people</text>
  <text start="260.849" dur="4.231">are looking at this in countries and</text>
  <text start="263.16" dur="3.03">other central banks that are not part of</text>
  <text start="265.08" dur="2.79">the private western central banking</text>
  <text start="266.19" dur="4.5">system they&amp;#39;re looking at this and</text>
  <text start="267.87" dur="5.729">saying you know something this is a way</text>
  <text start="270.69" dur="5.099">around the dollar and as we see the</text>
  <text start="273.599" dur="5.211">dollar collapse we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="275.789" dur="5.461">an alternative now the days of just</text>
  <text start="278.81" dur="3.91">holding the cryptocurrency and just</text>
  <text start="281.25" dur="3.72">crossing your fingers that it goes up I</text>
  <text start="282.72" dur="5.04">think those days are over I mean they</text>
  <text start="284.97" dur="4.59">might come back during the period of</text>
  <text start="287.76" dur="5.55">time that the entire system is breaking</text>
  <text start="289.56" dur="5.52">down and crypto currencies are rising</text>
  <text start="293.31" dur="2.97">because the manipulation is gone just</text>
  <text start="295.08" dur="4.14">like with gold and silver and everything</text>
  <text start="296.28" dur="6.569">else but until that time you need to</text>
  <text start="299.22" dur="6.33">navigate around all of this now a lot of</text>
  <text start="302.849" dur="5.401">people have joined the trading room</text>
  <text start="305.55" dur="4.56">where you have traders in there showing</text>
  <text start="308.25" dur="4.139">you and putting up charts and it&amp;#39;s an</text>

  <text start="315.39" dur="4.32">I&amp;#39;m in the room not as often as I like</text>
  <text start="318.18" dur="2.97">to be but I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="321.15" dur="5.48">separate room just for the x-22 people</text>

  <text start="330.53" dur="6.28">purchase cryptocurrency how to sell</text>
  <text start="334.32" dur="4.23">cryptocurrency and then once you learn</text>
  <text start="336.81" dur="3.51">that you can go into the trading room</text>

  <text start="404.22" dur="3.96">in and out of crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="406.23" dur="3.15">now a couple reports ago we talked about</text>
  <text start="408.18" dur="3.57">how Trump was looking at the</text>
  <text start="409.38" dur="6.75">trans-pacific partnership looking at it</text>
  <text start="411.75" dur="8.16">to join the TPP he would like to rewrite</text>
  <text start="416.13" dur="6.27">it he wanted to basically mold it into</text>
  <text start="419.91" dur="4.89">what he wanted it wanted it to be to</text>
  <text start="422.4" dur="6.09">join the one belt one road system with</text>
  <text start="424.8" dur="5.46">China and he looked at the TPP now there</text>
  <text start="428.49" dur="3.48">were individuals that were pushing him</text>
  <text start="430.26" dur="4.14">into this minuchin was one of them</text>
  <text start="431.97" dur="4.65">goldman sachs boy deep state operative</text>
  <text start="434.4" dur="4.26">there were other individuals that were</text>
  <text start="436.62" dur="4.47">also pushing this but i met i noticed a</text>
  <text start="438.66" dur="4.68">lot of the articles that were coming out</text>
  <text start="441.09" dur="3.87">minuchin was saying yes we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="443.34" dur="4.89">the TPP once again yes we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="444.96" dur="5.82">the TPP once again and Trump did assign</text>
  <text start="448.23" dur="4.62">individuals to look at it and they</text>
  <text start="450.78" dur="2.85">looked at it and they said listen it</text>
  <text start="452.85" dur="3.75">doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="453.63" dur="5.55">into what we want to do here I mean they</text>
  <text start="456.6" dur="4.47">looked at it and it just did not fit</text>
  <text start="459.18" dur="4.47">whatsoever now this is coming from Trump</text>
  <text start="461.07" dur="6.24">he said he opposed to the u.s.</text>
  <text start="463.65" dur="5.79">reentering the TPP and instead advocated</text>
  <text start="467.31" dur="5.64">for establishing bilateral trade deals</text>
  <text start="469.44" dur="5.4">with countries he said while Japan and</text>
  <text start="472.95" dur="4.68">South Korea would like us to go back</text>
  <text start="474.84" dur="5.22">into TPP I don&amp;#39;t like the deal if the</text>
  <text start="477.63" dur="6">United States too many contingencies and</text>
  <text start="480.06" dur="5.73">no way to get out if it doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="483.63" dur="4.8">he added that bilateral deals between</text>
  <text start="485.79" dur="4.98">two nations are far more efficient</text>
  <text start="488.43" dur="5.55">profitable and better for American</text>
  <text start="490.77" dur="7.59">workers and we see right now that the</text>
  <text start="493.98" dur="6.9">TPP was not designed to better the</text>
  <text start="498.36" dur="4.44">American people the workers of America</text>
  <text start="500.88" dur="4.83">it was to better the globalists because</text>
  <text start="502.8" dur="5.34">the NAFTA deal the TPP everything that</text>
  <text start="505.71" dur="5.28">was being set up was for the globalist</text>
  <text start="508.14" dur="5.91">system and again he thought he maybe he</text>
  <text start="510.99" dur="4.71">could rewrite it and make it work for</text>
  <text start="514.05" dur="3.48">the United States but it looks like at</text>
  <text start="515.7" dur="3.45">this point it is not going to work for</text>
  <text start="517.53" dur="3.99">the United States and bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="519.15" dur="3.78">deals with each individual country which</text>
  <text start="521.52" dur="3.15">i think is a better approach anyhow</text>
  <text start="522.93" dur="3.39">because this way if one country is not</text>
  <text start="524.67" dur="2.97">doing something it doesn&amp;#39;t affect the</text>
  <text start="526.32" dur="3.33">rest because you have different deals</text>
  <text start="527.64" dur="4.08">with them it&amp;#39;s almost like diversifying</text>
  <text start="529.65" dur="5.61">your portfolio and I think that works</text>
  <text start="531.72" dur="7.05">out a lot better now the IMF they are</text>
  <text start="535.26" dur="6.51">getting very very nervous if we go back</text>
  <text start="538.77" dur="4.95">a year ago they came out with this</text>
  <text start="541.77" dur="5.78">global financial stability report and</text>
  <text start="543.72" dur="8.09">they issued a warning and they saw that</text>
  <text start="547.55" dur="7.45">private sector debt governmental debt</text>
  <text start="551.81" dur="4.87">was rising very very quickly and it</text>
  <text start="555" dur="4.05">found that more than 20% of US</text>
  <text start="556.68" dur="5.67">corporations are at risk of defaults</text>
  <text start="559.05" dur="6.96">once is rates rise and if we move</text>
  <text start="562.35" dur="5.82">forward to today one year later the IMF</text>
  <text start="566.01" dur="4.83">once again sounded the alarm on debt</text>
  <text start="568.17" dur="5.01">only this time on the public side of the</text>
  <text start="570.84" dur="5.34">ledger warning about what else</text>
  <text start="573.18" dur="5.7">excessive global borrowing and noting</text>
  <text start="576.18" dur="5.909">that with a total of 164 trillion of</text>
  <text start="578.88" dur="5.79">debt or 225 percent of global debt to</text>
  <text start="582.089" dur="4.621">GDP the world&amp;#39;s public and private</text>
  <text start="584.67" dur="5.42">sectors are more in debt now</text>
  <text start="586.71" dur="8.37">than at the peak of the 2008 financial</text>
  <text start="590.09" dur="8.92">crisis when global debt peaked at 213</text>
  <text start="595.08" dur="6.57">percent of GDP now it&amp;#39;s at 225 percent</text>
  <text start="599.01" dur="6.66">of GDP I mean we&amp;#39;re almost at the point</text>
  <text start="601.65" dur="7.61">where we&amp;#39;re at the debt-to-gdp of world</text>
  <text start="605.67" dur="6.09">war ii and we were in a war at that time</text>
  <text start="609.26" dur="4.72">but they&amp;#39;re very very nervous about all</text>
  <text start="611.76" dur="6.24">of this they&amp;#39;re saying when looking at</text>
  <text start="613.98" dur="6">the big picture US China and Japan these</text>
  <text start="618" dur="5.61">three countries alone accounted for half</text>
  <text start="619.98" dur="6.96">of the 164 trillion total in global</text>
  <text start="623.61" dur="6.09">public and private sector debt they said</text>
  <text start="626.94" dur="6.18">there&amp;#39;s another third rising and that is</text>
  <text start="629.7" dur="6.15">interest rates the IMF said that the</text>
  <text start="633.12" dur="5.22">interest burden has doubled in the past</text>
  <text start="635.85" dur="5.58">ten years to close to 20 percent of</text>
  <text start="638.34" dur="5.84">taxes and what are they saying to do at</text>
  <text start="641.43" dur="6">this point they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="644.18" dur="8.2">governments right now they should raise</text>
  <text start="647.43" dur="9.11">their taxes lower public spending push</text>
  <text start="652.38" dur="7.83">austerity decrease annual borrowing and</text>
  <text start="656.54" dur="5.56">get the burden of debt on a firmly</text>
  <text start="660.21" dur="4.2">downward path basically what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="662.1" dur="5.52">very worried about is these countries</text>
  <text start="664.41" dur="4.53">imploding under their watch so they want</text>
  <text start="667.62" dur="4.56">to do what they did to Greece and Cyprus</text>
  <text start="668.94" dur="6.63">make the people pay for the countries</text>
  <text start="672.18" dur="5.55">taking on all of this debt and what</text>
  <text start="675.57" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re saying to do is raise the taxes</text>
  <text start="677.73" dur="4.83">on the people so this way you can pay</text>
  <text start="679.35" dur="5.97">the interest on the debt and basically</text>
  <text start="682.56" dur="5.13">cut a lot of your programs yes all this</text>

  <text start="934.699" dur="7.221">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="938.779" dur="6.451">Fed came out with their beige book and</text>
  <text start="941.92" dur="7.57">they are are in a panic right now the</text>
  <text start="945.23" dur="7.919">question is why are they in a panic well</text>
  <text start="949.49" dur="5.279">in March their beige book they never</text>
  <text start="953.149" dur="4.8">even mentioned that we&amp;#39;re tariffs no</text>
  <text start="954.769" dur="5.971">didn&amp;#39;t even show up zero times in this</text>
  <text start="957.949" dur="8.07">latest beige book for April they</text>
  <text start="960.74" dur="7.529">mentioned the word tariff 36 times now</text>
  <text start="966.019" dur="5.67">the Fed appears to be freaking out over</text>
  <text start="968.269" dur="5.211">the inflationary impact of tariffs now</text>
  <text start="971.689" dur="4.051">think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="973.48" dur="4.419">inflationary impact of terrorists</text>
  <text start="975.74" dur="4.529">they&amp;#39;ve been telling us that they can&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="980.269" dur="4.591">they&amp;#39;re barely trying to get the two</text>
  <text start="982.459" dur="5.061">percent but of course</text>
  <text start="984.86" dur="5.31">we can see inflation and food in fuel</text>
  <text start="987.52" dur="4.96">where they pushed it into housing into</text>
  <text start="990.17" dur="6.42">the stock market they pushed inflation</text>
  <text start="992.48" dur="8.04">overseas and there they&amp;#39;re very very</text>
  <text start="996.59" dur="7.13">worried about this so they&amp;#39;re worried</text>
  <text start="1000.52" dur="7.62">about tariffs in a growing vibrant</text>
  <text start="1003.72" dur="6.85">economy now think about this they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1014.29" dur="8.19">growing and everything is fine I mean if</text>
  <text start="1018.79" dur="5.669">this was true there would be no panic</text>
  <text start="1022.48" dur="5.01">because businesses could simply pass on</text>
  <text start="1024.459" dur="6.391">these costs to consumers but the fact</text>
  <text start="1027.49" dur="6.87">that there are no less than 36 instances</text>
  <text start="1030.85" dur="5.64">of tariff panic confirms all you need to</text>
  <text start="1034.36" dur="6.18">know about the pricing power of US</text>
  <text start="1036.49" dur="6.27">businesses there is none and what is</text>
  <text start="1040.54" dur="5.1">more problematic is whether the Fed will</text>
  <text start="1042.76" dur="6.69">view inflationary tariffs as a reason to</text>
  <text start="1045.64" dur="5.58">hike rates again in two months or to</text>
  <text start="1049.45" dur="3.66">keep them unchanged due to the resulting</text>
  <text start="1051.22" dur="5.13">decline in consumer purchasing power now</text>
  <text start="1053.11" dur="6.11">let&amp;#39;s think about the for a second Trump</text>
  <text start="1056.35" dur="6.84">put these tariffs into place</text>
  <text start="1059.22" dur="6.4">remember the push is to bring down the</text>

  <text start="1176.17" dur="6.21">if that is true remember what we said</text>

  <text start="1192.49" dur="7.38">you break an illusion well you force it</text>
  <text start="1196.72" dur="7.02">out into the open so people can see what</text>
  <text start="1199.87" dur="6.45">is really going on and that&amp;#39;s what is</text>
  <text start="1203.74" dur="5.069">happening right here this is why the IMF</text>
  <text start="1206.32" dur="5.64">the Fed this is why they&amp;#39;re panicking</text>
  <text start="1208.809" dur="5.631">right now the amount of debt they need</text>
  <text start="1211.96" dur="4.89">governments to cut back because remember</text>
  <text start="1214.44" dur="4.06">what were they planning on doing they</text>
  <text start="1216.85" dur="4.05">were planning on having an event a war</text>
  <text start="1218.5" dur="6.48">to cover all this up if you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1220.9" dur="6.15">this to cover it up they can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="1224.98" dur="4.05">anything else but acknowledge that</text>
  <text start="1227.05" dur="3.84">there&amp;#39;s problems because with a war you</text>
  <text start="1229.03" dur="4.35">could say hey listen we have something</text>
  <text start="1230.89" dur="6.3">going on here you need to cut back you</text>
  <text start="1233.38" dur="7.799">need to sacrifice all the dollars are</text>

  <text start="1254.68" dur="4.89">later on it&amp;#39;s a little bit more</text>
  <text start="1256.15" dur="5.93">difficult at this point because now the</text>
  <text start="1259.57" dur="5.37">blame is going to be turned towards them</text>
  <text start="1262.08" dur="6.01">because under their rule they&amp;#39;re telling</text>

  <text start="1295.36" dur="4.35">Patriots how can you turn this around</text>
  <text start="1297.4" dur="4.26">well because of the Fed raising interest</text>
