  <text start="101.34" dur="5.309">those leaders and again those leaders</text>

  <text start="108.84" dur="4.949">guard themselves because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="110.85" dur="5.519">to leave what they have and this is what</text>
  <text start="113.789" dur="4.981">happens throughout history and this is</text>
  <text start="116.369" dur="5.161">the clash and this is what we are seeing</text>
  <text start="118.77" dur="5.43">in many many countries I mean right now</text>
  <text start="121.53" dur="6.229">in Romania there are major protests</text>
  <text start="124.2" dur="7.44">because they chevron wants to come in</text>
  <text start="127.759" dur="6.551">extract oil and extract gold people are</text>

  <text start="134.31" dur="5.069">many riots happening right now in</text>
  <text start="136.29" dur="4.29">Romania also and you know we see this</text>
  <text start="139.379" dur="4.411">all over all around</text>
  <text start="140.58" dur="7.62">world in different countries in Greece</text>
  <text start="143.79" dur="8.67">we saw it we see it in Spain and we just</text>
  <text start="148.2" dur="6.99">you know every cumbers Argentina we saw</text>
  <text start="152.46" dur="4.77">it and when people are upset and you</text>
  <text start="155.19" dur="5.31">continually push people and take from</text>
  <text start="157.23" dur="6.3">the people people have nothing else to</text>
  <text start="160.5" dur="5.79">lose and this is what happens and very</text>
  <text start="163.53" dur="5.76">soon you will see this happening in a</text>
  <text start="166.29" dur="6.27">lot of the other European countries in</text>
  <text start="169.29" dur="5.16">the UK in the United States and we will</text>
  <text start="172.56" dur="5.31">definitely see this start to happen and</text>
  <text start="174.45" dur="6.03">spread across the globe now we talk a</text>
  <text start="177.87" dur="4.86">lot about surveillance and I hear a lot</text>
  <text start="180.48" dur="4.47">of people you know saying oh I have</text>
  <text start="182.73" dur="4.86">nothing to hide what&amp;#39;s the big deal the</text>
  <text start="184.95" dur="4.98">spying on my emails they&amp;#39;re spying on my</text>
  <text start="187.59" dur="4.23">texts it&amp;#39;s meaningless if you have</text>
  <text start="189.93" dur="4.95">nothing to hide you have nothing to</text>
  <text start="191.82" dur="5.88">worry about well that is kind of false</text>
  <text start="194.88" dur="6.21">because you don&amp;#39;t realize how many laws</text>
  <text start="197.7" dur="5.64">are on the books actually there are so</text>
  <text start="201.09" dur="5.36">many laws the federal government can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="203.34" dur="5.52">even count how many laws there are and</text>
  <text start="206.45" dur="5.2">if they don&amp;#39;t know how many there are</text>
  <text start="208.86" dur="5.31">how is every individual supposed to know</text>
  <text start="211.65" dur="5.9">what each law is and let me give you a</text>
  <text start="214.17" dur="5.819">sit this is a very simple example if</text>
  <text start="217.55" dur="5.53">they are coming after you and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="219.989" dur="5.25">like well I did nothing wrong let&amp;#39;s use</text>
  <text start="223.08" dur="6.12">for an example and this is a ridiculous</text>
  <text start="225.239" dur="7.621">law but it&amp;#39;s on the books it is a</text>
  <text start="229.2" dur="6.99">federal crime to be in possession of a</text>
  <text start="232.86" dur="5.76">lobster under a certain size so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="236.19" dur="6.66">say in an email you were telling your</text>
  <text start="238.62" dur="6">friend and yes this is an actual law you</text>
  <text start="242.85" dur="3.81">have a lobster doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="244.62" dur="4.71">dead or alive and you give the</text>
  <text start="246.66" dur="7.13">measurement and they are looking for a</text>
  <text start="249.33" dur="7.89">way to get you they will use this</text>
  <text start="253.79" dur="6.699">against you even though you think you</text>
  <text start="257.22" dur="6.39">did nothing wrong they still have you</text>
  <text start="260.489" dur="5.191">and this is the problem with spying and</text>
  <text start="263.61" dur="4.92">there is many many other laws that are</text>
  <text start="265.68" dur="5.7">just like this which are seem like oh</text>
  <text start="268.53" dur="5.82">it&amp;#39;s no big deal but they will use it to</text>
  <text start="271.38" dur="6.12">go after you so even though you think</text>
  <text start="274.35" dur="4.68">you&amp;#39;re not doing something wrong you</text>
  <text start="277.5" dur="3.15">don&amp;#39;t know what you&amp;#39;re doing because you</text>
  <text start="279.03" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t know every single law that&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="280.65" dur="4.92">there and this is why you do not want to</text>
  <text start="283.38" dur="5.25">be spied upon because when the collapse</text>
  <text start="285.57" dur="6.47">comes and we see that there&amp;#39;s a new DHS</text>
  <text start="288.63" dur="8.61">leader who&amp;#39;s been appointed but not yet</text>
  <text start="292.04" dur="9.43">fully into the position and once he does</text>
  <text start="297.24" dur="8.07">get in this person is going to take DHS</text>
  <text start="301.47" dur="6.66">to the next level and that is getting</text>
  <text start="305.31" dur="5.7">everything in order and everything ready</text>
  <text start="308.13" dur="7.26">for what is coming and that looks like</text>
  <text start="311.01" dur="8.58">this new person is going to be a person</text>
  <text start="315.39" dur="8.01">that will go after anyone at any time</text>
  <text start="319.59" dur="6.84">and bring them in or assassinate them or</text>
  <text start="323.4" dur="6.15">drone strike them if they if he believes</text>
  <text start="326.43" dur="6.96">that you are some type of domestic</text>
  <text start="329.55" dur="5.67">terrorists and again they will use these</text>
  <text start="333.39" dur="5.46">laws and everything that you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="335.22" dur="5.4">doing against you any way they can even</text>
  <text start="338.85" dur="4.71">though you don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="340.62" dur="7.46">something wrong and this is why everyone</text>
  <text start="343.56" dur="7.26">should be concerned about this spine and</text>
  <text start="348.08" dur="4.66">we also have to remember all of this is</text>
  <text start="350.82" dur="4.62">a complete violation of the Fourth</text>
  <text start="352.74" dur="4.89">Amendment but again the powers that be</text>
  <text start="355.44" dur="4.23">would like to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="357.63" dur="5.15">Constitution and they&amp;#39;ve been chipping</text>
  <text start="359.67" dur="7.56">and chipping away at it all this time</text>
  <text start="362.78" dur="7.36">now out in Syria we understand that they</text>
  <text start="367.23" dur="6.27">are dismantling the chemical weapons and</text>
  <text start="370.14" dur="6.36">we understand that John Kerry Susan Rice</text>
  <text start="373.5" dur="6.12">President Obama what they really want is</text>
  <text start="376.5" dur="5.88">to remove Assad and put in a puppet</text>
  <text start="379.62" dur="5.31">government to place the US dollar back</text>
  <text start="382.38" dur="4.23">in there as the reserve currency and to</text>
  <text start="384.93" dur="3.21">set up a private western central bank</text>
  <text start="386.61" dur="5.09">and to sell their natural resources</text>
  <text start="388.14" dur="7.62">using the US dollar we understand this</text>
  <text start="391.7" dur="7.06">we also understand that the rebels which</text>
  <text start="395.76" dur="5.03">are the paid mercenaries are fighting</text>
  <text start="398.76" dur="7.26">against Assad and they really work for</text>
  <text start="400.79" dur="6.51">the US central bankers Saudi Arabia who</text>
  <text start="406.02" dur="4.04">have been funding them</text>
  <text start="407.3" dur="6.089">typing them weapons and whatnot since</text>
  <text start="410.06" dur="7.639">this piece talk these rebels these paid</text>
  <text start="413.389" dur="7.831">mercenaries have become very upset and</text>
  <text start="417.699" dur="7.12">they are speaking out now saying that</text>
  <text start="421.22" dur="6.8">the US and the Gulf states are liars</text>
  <text start="424.819" dur="6.57">they are not supporting us anymore and</text>
  <text start="428.02" dur="6.13">this is from Abu Mohammed who says all</text>
  <text start="431.389" dur="5.011">of them are liars all of them I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="434.15" dur="4.38">know how I can express it better and we</text>
  <text start="436.4" dur="4.259">are not hoping anything from them</text>
  <text start="438.53" dur="4.56">meaning the US and the Gulf states</text>
  <text start="440.659" dur="5.16">whatever they say we don&amp;#39;t believe it</text>
  <text start="443.09" dur="5.009">and what is happening is they are</text>
  <text start="445.819" dur="5.82">becoming angry because they are left out</text>
  <text start="448.099" dur="5.85">there and there the support for them is</text>
  <text start="451.639" dur="5.701">kind of dwindling because of what is</text>
  <text start="453.949" dur="5.46">going on because how do you support the</text>
  <text start="457.34" dur="4.199">paid mercenaries when you when the</text>
  <text start="459.409" dur="5.07">president came out there saying that all</text>
  <text start="461.539" dur="6.72">we wanted was the chemical weapons to be</text>
  <text start="464.479" dur="5.821">removed and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="468.259" dur="4.59">contradicting themselves so what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="470.3" dur="5.58">happening now there is a warning now and</text>
  <text start="472.849" dur="4.951">this is perfect for the false flag event</text>
  <text start="475.88" dur="4.92">warning that these terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="477.8" dur="7.979">these paid mercenaries that they</text>
  <text start="480.8" dur="8.489">supported might turn on their allies</text>
  <text start="485.779" dur="6.241">because of how angry they are that they</text>
  <text start="489.289" dur="8.91">just left them with nothing and you know</text>
  <text start="492.02" dur="8.429">we can see that the al Qaeda groups that</text>
  <text start="498.199" dur="4.65">are out there the other paid mercenaries</text>
  <text start="500.449" dur="6.18">the moderates whatever they want to call</text>
  <text start="502.849" dur="5.641">them or becoming angry and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="506.629" dur="6.47">saying now the u.s. is warning that</text>
  <text start="508.49" dur="7.02">these groups might turn on the US and</text>
  <text start="513.099" dur="6.63">this goes on to say that one of the</text>
  <text start="515.51" dur="8.699">other al Qaeda leader says the u.s. arms</text>
  <text start="519.729" dur="6.73">the u.s. arms al-qaeda and forces the</text>
  <text start="524.209" dur="5.401">one hand and on the other sends them to</text>
  <text start="526.459" dur="6.181">their death and you know they were in</text>
  <text start="529.61" dur="5.789">the past the US the CIA and Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="532.64" dur="4.92">were arming the rebels and on the other</text>
  <text start="535.399" dur="3.841">hand they&amp;#39;re not helping out with any</text>
  <text start="537.56" dur="2.87">type of airstrikes that they wanted</text>
  <text start="539.24" dur="3.53">because they could just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="540.43" dur="5.46">get into Assad but you have to remember</text>
  <text start="542.77" dur="6.75">the US government central bankers Saudi</text>
  <text start="545.89" dur="7.8">Arabia Israel they all want Assad</text>
  <text start="549.52" dur="7.68">removed from office and they want to put</text>
  <text start="553.69" dur="6.54">in the puppet regime in into Syria and</text>
  <text start="557.2" dur="5.22">this will enable them because Syria and</text>
  <text start="560.23" dur="5.79">Iran have a treaty with each other will</text>
  <text start="562.42" dur="7.08">enable them to go into Iran once iran or</text>
  <text start="566.02" dur="8.04">Assad I mean Assad asked for help Iran</text>
  <text start="569.5" dur="6.839">comes to Assad aid and this gives the</text>
  <text start="574.06" dur="3.96">green light to start fighting with Iran</text>
  <text start="576.339" dur="7.381">and you can see how this is going to</text>
  <text start="578.02" dur="9.54">play out ok now the UK is warning about</text>
  <text start="583.72" dur="6.059">a cyber attack against their power grid</text>
  <text start="587.56" dur="4.56">their infrastructure and this goes on to</text>
  <text start="589.779" dur="4.021">say a leading security expert whose</text>
  <text start="592.12" dur="3.39">company holds contracts with the</text>
  <text start="593.8" dur="4.08">Ministry of Defense has warned that</text>
  <text start="595.51" dur="5.16">Britain&amp;#39;s energy infrastructure is at</text>
  <text start="597.88" dur="6.45">risk of shut down from cyberattacks and</text>
  <text start="600.67" dur="6.09">the actions of foreign owners and we see</text>
  <text start="604.33" dur="5.61">this happening in the u.s. we see this</text>
  <text start="606.76" dur="5.67">happening in Australia we see this being</text>
  <text start="609.94" dur="6.089">reported in some of the other European</text>
  <text start="612.43" dur="7.62">nations in the South Korea and this is</text>
  <text start="616.029" dur="6.241">going to be a world-wide type of an</text>
  <text start="620.05" dur="5.43">event when this hits because these cyber</text>
  <text start="622.27" dur="5.43">attacks will hit the power grids will</text>
  <text start="625.48" dur="4.14">siphon off the money from the banks not</text>
  <text start="627.7" dur="3.81">just here in the US and you can see</text>
  <text start="629.62" dur="4.7">they&amp;#39;re building this up all the crowd</text>
  <text start="631.51" dur="6">all across the world in many of the</text>
  <text start="634.32" dur="6.4">private western central bank countries</text>
  <text start="637.51" dur="5.1">and they are definitely getting prepared</text>
  <text start="640.72" dur="5.55">for what is coming and we do have to</text>
  <text start="642.61" dur="7.229">remember that Janet Napolitano issue is</text>
  <text start="646.27" dur="5.4">leaving said not if but when a cyber</text>
  <text start="649.839" dur="4.951">attack if they already have a plan and</text>
  <text start="651.67" dur="4.919">they already slipped it&amp;#39;s kind of like</text>
  <text start="654.79" dur="4.08">they slip up when they start to tell you</text>
  <text start="656.589" dur="4.351">these things because you know their egos</text>
  <text start="658.87" dur="4.62">get the best of them and they like to</text>
  <text start="660.94" dur="4.92">say that they know something and they</text>
  <text start="663.49" dur="4.08">know that what&amp;#39;s coming and we already</text>
  <text start="665.86" dur="3.3">know that they&amp;#39;ve been planning this</text>

  <text start="680.37" dur="5.76">with their propaganda Australia was</text>
  <text start="683.57" dur="6.79">reporting a lot of cyber attacks using</text>
  <text start="686.13" dur="6.15">their servers as places where they use</text>
  <text start="690.36" dur="4.56">them as bouncing the the cyber attacks</text>
  <text start="692.28" dur="4.77">off the servers in Australia so we can</text>

  <text start="746.04" dur="4.26">remember this is all part of the private</text>
  <text start="747.48" dur="4.14">western central bank&amp;#39;s because Kenya had</text>
  <text start="750.3" dur="4.62">made a deal but trying to become a</text>
  <text start="751.62" dur="5.43">clearinghouse which would bypass the US</text>
  <text start="754.92" dur="3.75">dollar and the US dollar would not be</text>
  <text start="757.05" dur="4.29">used and this is why they&amp;#39;re positioning</text>
  <text start="758.67" dur="5.01">themselves in Kenya and they do this by</text>
  <text start="761.34" dur="7.11">having terrorist attacks and which kind</text>
  <text start="763.68" dur="6.69">of gives them I don&amp;#39;t know permission to</text>
  <text start="768.45" dur="3.6">say Oh we get to go in there now because</text>
  <text start="770.37" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re terrorists well the same thing</text>
  <text start="772.05" dur="4.25">in Uganda is happening and I started to</text>
  <text start="774.27" dur="5.7">do a little research and we see that</text>
  <text start="776.3" dur="8.52">china is making a deal with Uganda a two</text>
  <text start="779.97" dur="7.89">billion dollar deal to secure a</text>
  <text start="784.82" dur="6.49">petroleum field and develop a petroleum</text>
  <text start="787.86" dur="6.03">field in Uganda and help propel the East</text>

  <text start="793.89" dur="5.4">oil-producing countries and you&amp;#39;ll never</text>
  <text start="796.8" dur="6.15">guess what they&amp;#39;re going to bypass you</text>
  <text start="799.29" dur="6.21">got it the US dollar and now we can see</text>
  <text start="802.95" dur="4.71">if something happens there and these</text>
  <text start="805.5" dur="5.49">threats are real we understand</text>
  <text start="807.66" dur="5.34">why because another country which does</text>
  <text start="810.99" dur="3.36">not have the private western central</text>
  <text start="813" dur="7.08">bank which is part of the BRIC nations</text>
  <text start="814.35" dur="8.73">is making deals to help these African</text>
  <text start="820.08" dur="5.58">Nations become oil-producing nations</text>
  <text start="823.08" dur="5.73">pretty much like the US did with the Mid</text>
  <text start="825.66" dur="5.52">East during the 70&amp;#39;s it seems like China</text>
  <text start="828.81" dur="4.59">is following in the footsteps doing the</text>
  <text start="831.18" dur="7.41">same thing making deal Kenya make a deal</text>
  <text start="833.4" dur="7.83">with Uganda and other different nations</text>
  <text start="838.59" dur="5.3">and sending up many many deals and we</text>
  <text start="841.23" dur="9.45">can see how this is going to turn out</text>
  <text start="843.89" dur="9.55">now there is an FBI warning and the</text>
  <text start="850.68" dur="4.86">responding to threats to a Midwest water</text>
  <text start="853.44" dur="5.37">supply system and they are on high alert</text>
  <text start="855.54" dur="4.83">right now and Reuters reports that the</text>
  <text start="858.81" dur="3.51">FBI and other agencies are in the</text>
  <text start="860.37" dur="5.13">process of investigating multiple</text>
  <text start="862.32" dur="8.49">threats to a water system in the Midwest</text>
  <text start="865.5" dur="8.49">and these water utilities if hackers</text>
  <text start="870.81" dur="5.31">were to take control of the computers</text>
  <text start="873.99" dur="4.2">that maintain safe water levels and</text>
  <text start="876.12" dur="4.25">chemical treatment they could</text>
  <text start="878.19" dur="5.73">potentially poison the water supply of</text>
  <text start="880.37" dur="5.77">millions and what the other thing that</text>
  <text start="883.92" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re very worried about if it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="886.14" dur="5.07">some type of where if it was coupled</text>
  <text start="887.73" dur="6.57">with a cyberattack this water system</text>
  <text start="891.21" dur="6.12">could be poisoned with some type of</text>
  <text start="894.3" dur="4.74">biological agent and they could you know</text>
  <text start="897.33" dur="4.56">if it&amp;#39;s released into the water system</text>
  <text start="899.04" dur="6.57">or chemical type of agent it could</text>
  <text start="901.89" dur="6.81">really kill millions of people actually</text>
  <text start="905.61" dur="4.89">this is I&amp;#39;m sorry this is about 500,000</text>
  <text start="908.7" dur="4.98">people that this plant but if this</text>
  <text start="910.5" dur="8.18">happens in many multiple water systems</text>
  <text start="913.68" dur="9.45">this could have the potential disastrous</text>
  <text start="918.68" dur="7.24">effect of making many people sick or</text>
  <text start="923.13" dur="6.84">killing many more than 500,000 people</text>
  <text start="925.92" dur="6.33">and in the past hackers have already</text>
  <text start="929.97" dur="5.79">broken into water utility computer</text>
  <text start="932.25" dur="7.05">systems recently and made them unsafe</text>
  <text start="935.76" dur="5.8">and we can see this happening more and</text>
  <text start="939.3" dur="7.65">more now we see that there was a war</text>
  <text start="941.56" dur="7.53">curve out in Arkansas that disrupted the</text>
  <text start="946.95" dur="5.29">electric out there by hitting the power</text>
  <text start="949.09" dur="4.68">grid and we understand that there is the</text>
  <text start="952.24" dur="5.07">threat going on with the water systems</text>
  <text start="953.77" dur="7.56">we understand that there is a power grid</text>
  <text start="957.31" dur="6.3">drill coming up in November UK is</text>
  <text start="961.33" dur="4.68">worrying about a hacker attack against</text>
  <text start="963.61" dur="4.62">their power grid infrastructure and we</text>
  <text start="966.01" dur="4.41">see a lot of these warnings coming out</text>
  <text start="968.23" dur="4.56">because they are getting ready we also</text>
  <text start="970.42" dur="7.05">see a lot of glitches happening in many</text>
  <text start="972.79" dur="7.02">of the systems and we saw Amazon we sort</text>
  <text start="977.47" dur="4.86">Netflix we saw vines we see Nasdaq</text>
  <text start="979.81" dur="6.3">having many glitches all of a sudden out</text>
  <text start="982.33" dur="5.52">of the blue one after another and we are</text>
  <text start="986.11" dur="5.28">starting to see this in many different</text>
  <text start="987.85" dur="6.3">places and they are just prepping and</text>
  <text start="991.39" dur="5.19">preparing for something to come and we</text>
  <text start="994.15" dur="5.7">know they have this window of</text>
  <text start="996.58" dur="5.759">opportunity they understand that they</text>
  <text start="999.85" dur="4.65">need to get something started because</text>
  <text start="1002.339" dur="4.981">right now they&amp;#39;re reporting that the</text>
  <text start="1004.5" dur="4.11">economy is in a decline there of course</text>
  <text start="1007.32" dur="2.82">they&amp;#39;re blaming it on the government</text>
  <text start="1008.61" dur="3.42">shutdown the president&amp;#39;s out there</text>
  <text start="1010.14" dur="3.99">blaming it on the government shutdown</text>
  <text start="1012.03" dur="4.17">and we all know from what I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1014.13" dur="5.61">talking about all along this has nothing</text>
  <text start="1016.2" dur="7.35">to do with the shutdown the economy was</text>
  <text start="1019.74" dur="5.599">declining by itself they were pushing it</text>
  <text start="1023.55" dur="4.86">up pushing it up during the summer</text>
  <text start="1025.339" dur="6.071">blowing up bubbles and now they cannot</text>
  <text start="1028.41" dur="4.95">continue with it and right now they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1031.41" dur="5.669">been massaging the data manipulating the</text>
  <text start="1033.36" dur="5.31">data and we&amp;#39;re coming to the end game at</text>
  <text start="1037.079" dur="3.331">this point and they realize this and</text>
  <text start="1038.67" dur="3.899">they thought they were going to have</text>
  <text start="1040.41" dur="5.01">this taken care of already with the</text>
  <text start="1042.569" dur="6.811">Syria war and now the timeline has been</text>
  <text start="1045.42" dur="6.48">pushed back a little bit and we also</text>
  <text start="1049.38" dur="6.42">have to remember the banks are preparing</text>
