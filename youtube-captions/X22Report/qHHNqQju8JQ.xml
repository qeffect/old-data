  <text start="40.55" dur="5.13">episode is us/nato using turkey to</text>
  <text start="43.37" dur="5.82">provoke Russia by downing a jet to start</text>
  <text start="45.68" dur="6.03">the war let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="49.19" dur="5.07">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="51.71" dur="4.98">now pew has just come out with a new</text>
  <text start="54.26" dur="4.53">national survey and this is coming from</text>
  <text start="56.69" dur="3.899">the Pew Research Center and it reveals</text>
  <text start="58.79" dur="4.019">how distrustful the American public</text>
  <text start="60.589" dur="4.47">feels about the media right now</text>
  <text start="62.809" dur="4.411">sixty-five percent say the national news</text>
  <text start="65.059" dur="5.131">media impacts the country in a negative</text>
  <text start="67.22" dur="5.61">way maybe because the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="70.19" dur="5.19">lying to the public they&amp;#39;re not doing</text>
  <text start="72.83" dur="4.7">any investigative reporting they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="75.38" dur="4.14">really digging for facts and the</text>
  <text start="77.53" dur="5.41">following the script from the government</text>
  <text start="79.52" dur="7.23">yes this would pose a problem and to go</text>
  <text start="82.94" dur="6.599">further Americans simply do not trust</text>
  <text start="86.75" dur="5.039">the federal government only nineteen</text>
  <text start="89.539" dur="4.83">percent believe they can trust the</text>
  <text start="91.789" dur="4.801">government in Washington to do the right</text>
  <text start="94.369" dur="4.59">thing well again we have to go back to</text>
  <text start="96.59" dur="4.889">are they telling us the truth are they</text>
  <text start="98.959" dur="5.101">working in the best interest of the</text>
  <text start="101.479" dur="4.291">people and what we found out from all</text>
  <text start="104.06" dur="2.96">our research is that they&amp;#39;re in there</text>
  <text start="105.77" dur="4.26">working in the best interest of</text>
  <text start="107.02" dur="6.76">corporations central banks special</text>
  <text start="110.03" dur="6.27">lobbyists groups and not the American</text>
  <text start="113.78" dur="4.89">people and this is why you see the</text>
  <text start="116.3" dur="5.61">American people not trusting the federal</text>
  <text start="118.67" dur="6.96">government right now for example there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="121.91" dur="6.239">a bill that&amp;#39;s being introduced that</text>
  <text start="125.63" dur="6.51">would view corporate crimes as an honest</text>
  <text start="128.149" dur="5.221">mistake wealthy conservatives are</text>
  <text start="132.14" dur="4.55">pushing a bill that would excuse</text>
  <text start="133.37" dur="5.64">corporate leaders from financial fraud</text>
  <text start="136.69" dur="4.93">environmental pollution and other crimes</text>
  <text start="139.01" dur="5.64">that America&amp;#39;s greatest criminals deemed</text>
  <text start="141.62" dur="4.32">simply reckless or negligent the</text>
  <text start="144.65" dur="3.24">Heritage Foundation attempts to</text>
  <text start="145.94" dur="4.439">rationalize saying someone who simply</text>
  <text start="147.89" dur="4.5">has an accident by being slightly</text>
  <text start="150.379" dur="4.741">careless can hardly be said to have</text>
  <text start="152.39" dur="4.89">acted with a guilty mind well if you</text>
  <text start="155.12" dur="3.78">want to take that rationale you can</text>
  <text start="157.28" dur="3.78">apply to pretty much everything and</text>
  <text start="158.9" dur="3.63">everyone will not commit any type of</text>
  <text start="161.06" dur="2.28">crime basically what they&amp;#39;re doing right</text>
  <text start="162.53" dur="5.61">now</text>
  <text start="163.34" dur="8.6">we are merged melded into a fascist</text>
  <text start="168.14" dur="7.98">government where corporate and</text>
  <text start="171.94" dur="6.79">government melds into one and they</text>
  <text start="176.12" dur="4.86">protect each other and they do things in</text>
  <text start="178.73" dur="5.24">the best interest for each other and</text>
  <text start="180.98" dur="7.259">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing at this point</text>
  <text start="183.97" dur="6.7">now to take this a step further we are</text>
  <text start="188.239" dur="3.75">definitely seeing that everything that</text>
  <text start="190.67" dur="3.89">comes out of the government at this</text>
  <text start="191.989" dur="4.741">point is not a benefit to the people</text>
  <text start="194.56" dur="4.39">they are not a benefit to the people</text>
  <text start="196.73" dur="4.46">look at affordable care act look at the</text>
  <text start="198.95" dur="4.77">Patriot Act look at the USA Freedom Act</text>
  <text start="201.19" dur="4.6">look at everything they push out there</text>
  <text start="203.72" dur="5.34">whatever the titles say they are the</text>
  <text start="205.79" dur="6.93">opposite and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="209.06" dur="6.36">government&amp;#39;s throughout the world here</text>
  <text start="212.72" dur="8.19">in the United States they are trying to</text>
  <text start="215.42" dur="8.19">get the people together and control them</text>
  <text start="220.91" dur="6.389">and they want to make sure that they are</text>
  <text start="223.61" dur="6.029">spying on each other so right now in New</text>
  <text start="227.299" dur="5.16">York what we&amp;#39;re seeing is since the</text>
  <text start="229.639" dur="5.91">Paris attacks New York is taking its</text>
  <text start="232.459" dur="6.481">fight with terrorism to a new level they</text>
  <text start="235.549" dur="6.151">created an app if you see something send</text>
  <text start="238.94" dur="6.15">something take pictures of it and send</text>
  <text start="241.7" dur="6.539">it in to the authorities well I mean it</text>
  <text start="245.09" dur="4.17">sounds like a good idea except people</text>
  <text start="248.239" dur="4.161">are going to be taking pictures of</text>
  <text start="249.26" dur="5.699">pretty much anything and the</text>
  <text start="252.4" dur="3.55">investigators are going to spend are</text>
  <text start="254.959" dur="4.351">going to be spending all their time</text>
  <text start="255.95" dur="6.66">running around doing everything except</text>
  <text start="259.31" dur="6">stopping terrorism and that&amp;#39;s if you</text>
  <text start="262.61" dur="4.65">really believe there are terrorists</text>
  <text start="265.31" dur="3.8">running around in this country which I</text>
  <text start="267.26" dur="4.409">do not I believe these are all</text>
  <text start="269.11" dur="4.809">government-sponsored false flag events</text>
  <text start="271.669" dur="4.411">do I believe there are terrorists out</text>
  <text start="273.919" dur="5.97">there yes but the ones that we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="276.08" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re backed up by governments so</text>
  <text start="279.889" dur="3.061">basically what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="281.12" dur="4.53">basically creating this app and they</text>
  <text start="282.95" dur="5.85">want people to go out and take pictures</text>
  <text start="285.65" dur="6.48">and send it in four different different</text>
  <text start="288.8" dur="5.25">people all around New York City it was</text>
  <text start="292.13" dur="3.06">almost like the law they passed where</text>
  <text start="294.05" dur="2.71">they said listen we&amp;#39;ll give you a five</text>
  <text start="295.19" dur="5.62">hundred dollar reward if you</text>
  <text start="296.76" dur="6.03">someone has a an illegal gun and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="300.81" dur="4.74">start the investigation this is the same</text>
  <text start="302.79" dur="5.52">type of thing and Nazi Germany actually</text>
  <text start="305.55" dur="4.44">use this where they had people blowing</text>
  <text start="308.31" dur="4.65">the whistle on others who pretty much</text>
  <text start="309.99" dur="6.33">are against the government who don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="312.96" dur="5.97">agree with the government and I noticed</text>
  <text start="316.32" dur="5.07">at their promotional advertisement for</text>
  <text start="318.93" dur="5.96">this new app they show a truck with you</text>
  <text start="321.39" dur="6.63">know toxic material propane gas and</text>
  <text start="324.89" dur="6.19">poison which to me this could be</text>
  <text start="328.02" dur="5.97">anything and this could be part of a</text>
  <text start="331.08" dur="5.04">company this is their job they supply</text>
  <text start="333.99" dur="5.25">propane gas and they clean up toxic</text>
  <text start="336.12" dur="5.64">material I mean this makes no sense</text>
  <text start="339.24" dur="7.17">whatsoever but again they want the</text>
  <text start="341.76" dur="9.42">people to tell on each other now the</text>
  <text start="346.41" dur="8.16">White House is pushing the idea of gun</text>
  <text start="351.18" dur="5.19">control this Thanksgiving the Obama</text>
  <text start="354.57" dur="5.52">administration wants Americans to talk</text>
  <text start="356.37" dur="6.96">about why Congress won&amp;#39;t pass more gun</text>
  <text start="360.09" dur="4.59">control well I&amp;#39;m going to turn this</text>
  <text start="363.33" dur="3.3">around and say everyone should be</text>
  <text start="364.68" dur="4.89">talking about why we need a weapon this</text>
  <text start="366.63" dur="6.08">Thanksgiving because they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="369.57" dur="6">get everyone to talk about gun control</text>
  <text start="372.71" dur="7.12">we&amp;#39;re basically we have the Second</text>
  <text start="375.57" dur="8.34">Amendment and it allows us to have</text>
  <text start="379.83" dur="5.79">weapons they&amp;#39;re trying to push everyone</text>
  <text start="383.91" dur="4.53">this Thanksgiving to start a debate</text>
  <text start="385.62" dur="4.41">inside the families and if you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="388.44" dur="4.76">to start a debate make sure you have the</text>
  <text start="390.03" dur="6.42">facts of why people need to keep weapons</text>
  <text start="393.2" dur="6.13">not give up their weapons now Josh</text>
  <text start="396.45" dur="6.51">earnest was talking about enhanced</text>
  <text start="399.33" dur="6.42">national security and he&amp;#39;s insisting</text>
  <text start="402.96" dur="4.17">that since we have all this terror going</text>
  <text start="405.75" dur="3.57">on and they mentioned this once before</text>
  <text start="407.13" dur="4.17">where they wanted to take the terror</text>
  <text start="409.32" dur="5.43">list and anyone that&amp;#39;s on this terror</text>
  <text start="411.3" dur="5.34">list they cannot own a weapon now of</text>
  <text start="414.75" dur="4.17">course we know terrorists they don&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="416.64" dur="4.5">to a store they don&amp;#39;t get fingerprinted</text>
  <text start="418.92" dur="3.63">they don&amp;#39;t go through the system to get</text>
  <text start="421.14" dur="4.53">their weapons they get it on the black</text>
  <text start="422.55" dur="5.61">market they get military weapons as</text>
  <text start="425.67" dur="4.019">we&amp;#39;ve seen across the world if you</text>
  <text start="428.16" dur="3.779">believe the</text>
  <text start="429.689" dur="5.07">men&amp;#39;s official stories but the problem</text>
  <text start="431.939" dur="4.47">with this is that their list you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="434.759" dur="3.69">know how you get on it you don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="436.409" dur="6">how do you get off of it and they can</text>
  <text start="438.449" dur="6.99">just throw anybody on this list and this</text>
  <text start="442.409" dur="5.31">is a problem and there is a message to</text>
  <text start="445.439" dur="4.68">these government officials about taking</text>
  <text start="447.719" dur="4.92">away our freedom of speech taking away</text>
  <text start="450.119" dur="5.58">our right to own a weapon taking away</text>
  <text start="452.639" dur="5.12">our rights of privacy and where they</text>
  <text start="455.699" dur="4.47">can&amp;#39;t search you without a warrant</text>
  <text start="457.759" dur="5.14">government employees need to remember</text>
  <text start="460.169" dur="6.39">and my wife reminded me of this because</text>
  <text start="462.899" dur="10.35">she&amp;#39;s a very smart woman that government</text>
  <text start="466.559" dur="11.52">is a privilege it is not a right we the</text>
  <text start="473.249" dur="11.75">people gave them this privilege to be in</text>
  <text start="478.079" dur="9.5">office this privilege can be taken away</text>
  <text start="484.999" dur="5.95">they need to remind themselves this</text>
  <text start="487.579" dur="7.36">remind themselves of this that this is</text>
  <text start="490.949" dur="6.72">not their right to go along with</text>
  <text start="494.939" dur="6.48">corporate interest foreign government</text>
  <text start="497.669" dur="6.57">interests central bank interests they</text>
  <text start="501.419" dur="6.06">need to remember this is a privilege</text>
  <text start="504.239" dur="6.29">where the people put them into office</text>
  <text start="507.479" dur="9.93">and that privilege can be revoked at any</text>
  <text start="510.529" dur="11.081">time something they need to remember now</text>
  <text start="517.409" dur="8.67">out in Kiev the power was shut down in</text>
  <text start="521.61" dur="8.07">Crimea and Ukraine right now is not</text>
  <text start="526.079" dur="5.581">repairing the sabotage power lines now</text>
  <text start="529.68" dur="4.469">there is certain areas that are back up</text>
  <text start="531.66" dur="5">on emergency power but there is no</text>
  <text start="534.149" dur="5.101">practical repair work going on right now</text>
  <text start="536.66" dur="4.56">extremists will not allow workers to</text>
  <text start="539.25" dur="5.16">repair the damaged power stations and</text>
  <text start="541.22" dur="4.78">it&amp;#39;s strange at this time that the</text>
  <text start="544.41" dur="4.77">authorities in Ukraine cannot provide</text>
  <text start="546" dur="7.37">access to the energy facilities so the</text>
  <text start="549.18" dur="10.2">question is why did the power go out</text>
  <text start="553.37" dur="7.87">what are they preparing for and what is</text>
  <text start="559.38" dur="4.02">the reason for this are they getting</text>
  <text start="561.24" dur="5.8">ready for a major offensive</text>
  <text start="563.4" dur="7.09">most likely yes now the Donetsk and</text>
  <text start="567.04" dur="5.13">Lugansk people they decided that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="570.49" dur="3">going to have to suspend Cole deliveries</text>
  <text start="572.17" dur="4.11">to the rest of Ukraine because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="573.49" dur="5.1">having talks discussing the delivery the</text>
  <text start="576.28" dur="6.42">payment and they&amp;#39;re saying Ukraine right</text>
  <text start="578.59" dur="5.94">now basically are not really talking</text>
  <text start="582.7" dur="5.04">with them the talks have come to a dead</text>
  <text start="584.53" dur="5.52">end and they&amp;#39;re saying that Kiev doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="587.74" dur="4.23">even want to go further with them and</text>
  <text start="590.05" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s not even worth it at</text>
  <text start="591.97" dur="4.58">this time so they&amp;#39;re just going to</text>
  <text start="593.56" dur="6">suspend all deliveries to that area and</text>
  <text start="596.55" dur="5.38">this concerns me right now because what</text>
  <text start="599.56" dur="7.44">we&amp;#39;re seeing is a power outage in Crimea</text>
  <text start="601.93" dur="8.97">the extremists don&amp;#39;t will not let anyone</text>
  <text start="607" dur="7.35">repair the power lines we understand the</text>
  <text start="610.9" dur="5.28">US and other foreign countries are in</text>
  <text start="614.35" dur="5.24">Ukraine training the National Guard the</text>
  <text start="616.18" dur="6.3">Armed Forces and Special Op teams and</text>
  <text start="619.59" dur="7.06">they&amp;#39;ve started shelling the don&amp;#39;t ask</text>
  <text start="622.48" dur="7.08">Lugansk area and the OSCE has proven and</text>
  <text start="626.65" dur="6.18">shown facts that yes Kiev is the one</text>
  <text start="629.56" dur="5.34">doing this and right now they decided to</text>
  <text start="632.83" dur="6.42">break off and not have talks anymore</text>
  <text start="634.9" dur="7.02">with the don Donetsk area secondly we</text>
  <text start="639.25" dur="5.16">see that the Mint&amp;#39;s to ceasefire</text>
  <text start="641.92" dur="6.29">agreement expires the end of this year</text>
  <text start="644.41" dur="7.47">and we understand at this point that</text>
  <text start="648.21" dur="6.82">Russia is in Syria destroying the</text>
  <text start="651.88" dur="5.06">Islamic state which basically hurts the</text>
  <text start="655.03" dur="6.18">united states and their proxy army and</text>
  <text start="656.94" dur="7.9">I&amp;#39;m thinking right now that because of</text>
  <text start="661.21" dur="5.64">this the u.s. is now ready to start</text>
  <text start="664.84" dur="5.49">something in Ukraine and bring this war</text>
  <text start="666.85" dur="5.58">to all fronts it looks like things are</text>
  <text start="670.33" dur="4.35">really starting to escalate and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="672.43" dur="6.9">preparing for something very very major</text>
  <text start="674.68" dur="6.42">at this time now Iran has we is going to</text>
  <text start="679.33" dur="4.11">start receiving their delivery of the</text>
  <text start="681.1" dur="3.72">Russian s-300 anti-missile rocket system</text>
  <text start="683.44" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re saying it has already started</text>
  <text start="684.82" dur="4.68">and they&amp;#39;re receiving the missiles of</text>
  <text start="686.86" dur="5.52">course Washington is real they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="689.5" dur="5.7">happy with this whatsoever and again</text>
  <text start="692.38" dur="4.65">these are defensive missile system and</text>
  <text start="695.2" dur="3.78">every time the u.s. comes out and</text>
  <text start="697.03" dur="3.6">says something about a different country</text>
  <text start="698.98" dur="3.78">where they always say they have the</text>
  <text start="700.63" dur="7.47">right to defend themselves well so does</text>
  <text start="702.76" dur="7.59">a ram now what we are seeing at this</text>
  <text start="708.1" dur="5.88">point and we mentioned this many times</text>
  <text start="710.35" dur="6.18">the u.s. is backed into a corner Russia</text>
  <text start="713.98" dur="4.11">is destroying the proxy army of the</text>
  <text start="716.53" dur="5.67">United States which is the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="718.09" dur="5.37">and al-qaeda and al-nusrah and every</text>
  <text start="722.2" dur="3.96">other terrorist organization inside</text>
  <text start="723.46" dur="4.98">Syria basically they&amp;#39;re funded they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="726.16" dur="4.95">paid for they supply them with military</text>
  <text start="728.44" dur="9.77">assets and they&amp;#39;re using them all to get</text>
  <text start="731.11" dur="13.14">Assad so basically turkey decided to</text>
  <text start="738.21" dur="9.79">basically shoot down a Russian jet they</text>
  <text start="744.25" dur="6.36">took it out because they said that the</text>
  <text start="748" dur="9.72">Russian jet flew into Turkish airspace</text>
  <text start="750.61" dur="11.46">and then the pilot ejected from the</text>
  <text start="757.72" dur="6.12">plane and basically on the ground you</text>
  <text start="762.07" dur="3.69">see the Islamic state and other</text>
  <text start="763.84" dur="5.19">terrorist organization they were</text>
  <text start="765.76" dur="5.97">basically firing at the person</text>
  <text start="769.03" dur="6.99">parachuting now there&amp;#39;s two different</text>
  <text start="771.73" dur="7.26">videos out there one shows them shooting</text>
  <text start="776.02" dur="5.13">at someone from the that&amp;#39;s in the sky</text>
  <text start="778.99" dur="4.59">but they&amp;#39;re coming down with a white</text>
  <text start="781.15" dur="6.35">parachute then there&amp;#39;s another video</text>
  <text start="783.58" dur="7.65">showing them shooting and the person</text>
  <text start="787.5" dur="5.86">coming down is in a red parachute so we</text>
  <text start="791.23" dur="7.32">have two conflicting videos right now</text>
  <text start="793.36" dur="9">which makes no sense so what happened</text>
  <text start="798.55" dur="7.04">here well turkey decided and they</text>
  <text start="802.36" dur="7.11">they&amp;#39;ve given Russia warnings before</text>
  <text start="805.59" dur="6.55">that do not come near our airspace do</text>
  <text start="809.47" dur="7.44">not cross over the border and the</text>
  <text start="812.14" dur="7.92">Russian su-24 as far as turkey is saying</text>
  <text start="816.91" dur="9.03">crossed into the border and violated its</text>
  <text start="820.06" dur="8.88">airspace and then we see that an a</text>
  <text start="825.94" dur="4.8">Russian helicopter was sent to rescue</text>
  <text start="828.94" dur="4.769">the pilot</text>
  <text start="830.74" dur="6.12">and the Syrian opposition said they shot</text>
  <text start="833.709" dur="7.201">it down using a tow missile which is</text>
  <text start="836.86" dur="6.419">supplied by the United States so what</text>
  <text start="840.91" dur="4.65">are we seeing here we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="843.279" dur="8.191">United States and Turkey now provoke</text>
  <text start="845.56" dur="9.719">Russia this is what they are pushing for</text>
  <text start="851.47" dur="5.309">right now they are pushing for a war and</text>
  <text start="855.279" dur="5.93">they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="856.779" dur="4.43">to provoke Russia into doing something</text>
  <text start="861.39" dur="7.9">so something right now doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="865.959" dur="6.811">sense because if you think of this and</text>
  <text start="869.29" dur="5.91">you use common sense Russia didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="872.77" dur="4.86">realize where they were where they were</text>
  <text start="875.2" dur="6.27">flying and let&amp;#39;s say they did maneuver</text>
  <text start="877.63" dur="9.3">into Turkish airspace the first reaction</text>
  <text start="881.47" dur="8.79">is to down a plane you know the Russian</text>
  <text start="886.93" dur="6.3">plane is not there to attack you know</text>
  <text start="890.26" dur="7.47">from the radar feed that it was bombing</text>
  <text start="893.23" dur="6.87">inside of Syria there could have been a</text>
  <text start="897.73" dur="4.95">warning there could have been maybe</text>
  <text start="900.1" dur="5.52">shots fired around the plane to give a</text>
  <text start="902.68" dur="6.029">warning but normally this happens quite</text>
  <text start="905.62" dur="11.73">often where planes go into different</text>
  <text start="908.709" dur="13.171">area so did Russia fly into Turkish</text>
  <text start="917.35" dur="11.359">airspace well we have to remember one</text>
  <text start="921.88" dur="9.18">thing here back on october fifth turkey</text>
  <text start="928.709" dur="4.211">intercepted a Russian jet which said</text>
  <text start="931.06" dur="4.8">they violated its airspace and this was</text>
  <text start="932.92" dur="9.83">this was a setup for what happened today</text>
  <text start="935.86" dur="9.93">and Turkey said that the f16 jets had</text>
  <text start="942.75" dur="4.54">intercepted the Russian fighter which</text>
  <text start="945.79" dur="5.01">violated Turkish airspace and they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="947.29" dur="5.58">given them a warning but what the</text>
  <text start="950.8" dur="5.34">corporate media kind of leaves out of</text>
  <text start="952.87" dur="7.38">this whole thing is that basically</text>
  <text start="956.14" dur="8.01">turkey extended its borders by five</text>
  <text start="960.25" dur="7.53">miles setting up a say</text>
  <text start="964.15" dur="9.84">zone area now they move their borders</text>
  <text start="967.78" dur="9.39">into Syria and basically the Russians</text>
  <text start="973.99" dur="8.7">who are flying around we&amp;#39;re flying</text>
  <text start="977.17" dur="10.92">throughout Syria so what we are seeing</text>
  <text start="982.69" dur="10.92">right now is that Turkey decided to go</text>
  <text start="988.09" dur="8.85">ahead with the okay from the US to fire</text>
  <text start="993.61" dur="7.29">at this plane and bring it down so on</text>
  <text start="996.94" dur="6.27">that October fifth date the US military</text>
  <text start="1000.9" dur="3.93">officials suggested the incident had</text>
  <text start="1003.21" dur="4.08">come close to sparking and on</text>
  <text start="1004.83" dur="4.35">confrontation and when you read the</text>
  <text start="1007.29" dur="4.62">report he said the Russian aircraft had</text>
  <text start="1009.18" dur="4.89">violated Turkish space by five miles and</text>
  <text start="1011.91" dur="3.87">that the Turkish Jets had scrambled but</text>
  <text start="1014.07" dur="3.66">the Russian aircraft had returned to</text>
  <text start="1015.78" dur="4.5">Syrian airspace remember they extended</text>
  <text start="1017.73" dur="4.71">their borders so the Turkish security</text>
  <text start="1020.28" dur="4.02">official said he could not confirm the</text>
  <text start="1022.44" dur="4.649">account whatsoever but the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="1024.3" dur="5.37">saying that yes this did happen so</text>
  <text start="1027.089" dur="7.021">basically the US was kind of pushing</text>
  <text start="1029.67" dur="6.9">Turkey in this direction and they were</text>
  <text start="1034.11" dur="7.77">claiming that their airspace was</text>
  <text start="1036.57" dur="12.93">violated so what we are seeing right now</text>
  <text start="1041.88" dur="9.87">is that the u.s. was directing turkey to</text>
  <text start="1049.5" dur="5.85">go after a Russian jet if it flew</text>
  <text start="1051.75" dur="7.59">anywhere in that five-mile safe zone now</text>
  <text start="1055.35" dur="9.21">this was this area is still inside Syria</text>
  <text start="1059.34" dur="8.79">and the Russian Defense Ministry put out</text>
  <text start="1064.56" dur="7.29">a video the actual radar following the</text>
  <text start="1068.13" dur="5.85">su-24 and when you look at the radar</text>
  <text start="1071.85" dur="5.19">information and remember turkey didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1073.98" dur="7.68">put out radar the US did not put out</text>
  <text start="1077.04" dur="8.82">radar Russia is putting out the radar</text>
  <text start="1081.66" dur="8.4">and when you follow it along the su-24</text>
  <text start="1085.86" dur="7.29">never entered Turkey according to the</text>
  <text start="1090.06" dur="6.71">borders that they had before turkey move</text>
  <text start="1093.15" dur="3.62">them five miles into Syria</text>
  <text start="1097.48" dur="9.22">so President Putin is saying that this</text>
  <text start="1101.72" dur="7.92">is a stab in the back and we&amp;#39;ll Putin go</text>
  <text start="1106.7" dur="5.61">ahead and start a war over this no he is</text>
  <text start="1109.64" dur="6.2">not he is not going to push this of</text>
  <text start="1112.31" dur="6.39">course Russia is upset about this and</text>
  <text start="1115.84" dur="4.42">basically they&amp;#39;re taking precautions</text>
  <text start="1118.7" dur="4.32">right now they&amp;#39;re upping their security</text>
  <text start="1120.26" dur="7.77">and at this point they decided to</text>
  <text start="1123.02" dur="7.94">basically stop all military activity</text>
  <text start="1128.03" dur="6.57">working with the Turkish government and</text>
  <text start="1130.96" dur="7.06">going forward this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="1134.6" dur="6.63">problem now we understand if we believe</text>
  <text start="1138.02" dur="5.28">the Turkish official story and the US</text>
  <text start="1141.23" dur="4.59">official story and if we go with that</text>
  <text start="1143.3" dur="5.16">line of thought that Oh Russia Jed they</text>
  <text start="1145.82" dur="7.41">flew into this area and they you know</text>
  <text start="1148.46" dur="7.46">accessed Turkish airspace but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1153.23" dur="6.18">think about this for a second logically</text>
  <text start="1155.92" dur="5.77">turkey has been bombing the PKK in North</text>
  <text start="1159.41" dur="4.77">Iraq without the permission of the Iraqi</text>
  <text start="1161.69" dur="7.07">government did they shoot down the</text>
  <text start="1164.18" dur="7.86">Turkish plane no Israel regularly</text>
  <text start="1168.76" dur="8.65">violates the airspace of Lebanon and</text>
  <text start="1172.04" dur="9.3">Syria and actually bomb Syria have their</text>
  <text start="1177.41" dur="7.86">planes been shot down no us France</text>
  <text start="1181.34" dur="7.59">Britain Jordan they will violate Syrian</text>
  <text start="1185.27" dur="6.96">airspace under the pretense of course of</text>
  <text start="1188.93" dur="6.89">getting terrorism but the Syria come and</text>
  <text start="1192.23" dur="9.15">shoot their planes down no this was</text>
  <text start="1195.82" dur="7.54">extreme this was uncalled for and it was</text>
  <text start="1201.38" dur="4.56">used of course for many different</text>
  <text start="1203.36" dur="5.79">agendas one was to provoke Russia the</text>
  <text start="1205.94" dur="5.22">other one if we remember Turkey got rid</text>
  <text start="1209.15" dur="4.8">of the Patriot air defense system and</text>
  <text start="1211.16" dur="5.49">this could be part of a part of the</text>
  <text start="1213.95" dur="6.81">agenda to have them bring the system</text>
  <text start="1216.65" dur="8.46">back into the country but we can see the</text>
  <text start="1220.76" dur="8.13">main objective was to provoke Russia at</text>
  <text start="1225.11" dur="5.64">this point so the flight data was</text>
  <text start="1228.89" dur="7.32">released by Russia</text>
  <text start="1230.75" dur="8.4">and it shows that the su-24 never enter</text>
  <text start="1236.21" dur="5.31">turkey airspace and was attacked while</text>
  <text start="1239.15" dur="7.83">performing legitimate maneuvers over</text>
  <text start="1241.52" dur="9.23">Syria and Putin right now is out there</text>
  <text start="1246.98" dur="6.27">saying that this goes far beyond what</text>
  <text start="1250.75" dur="5.86">turkey should be doing they took the</text>
  <text start="1253.25" dur="5.97">sides of the Islamic state and they were</text>
  <text start="1256.61" dur="8.73">protecting them this is why they shot</text>
  <text start="1259.22" dur="8.85">down the plane I mean he said turkey is</text>
  <text start="1265.34" dur="8.13">be hazing behaving as if Russia shut</text>
  <text start="1268.07" dur="7.71">down its own plane he says there is no</text>
  <text start="1273.47" dur="6.24">way that the Russian plane threatened</text>
  <text start="1275.78" dur="7.2">Turkey in any manner whatsoever remember</text>
  <text start="1279.71" dur="5.61">the US and Russia signed an accord with</text>
  <text start="1282.98" dur="7.71">the u.s. to avoid air incidents just</text>
  <text start="1285.32" dur="8.16">like this and Putin is out there saying</text>
  <text start="1290.69" dur="5.43">listen oil from the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="1293.48" dur="4.56">being shipped to Turkey and Turkey then</text>
  <text start="1296.12" dur="5.96">goes ahead and sells it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1298.04" dur="4.04">basically working with the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1302.59" dur="4.36">they get military support from the US</text>
  <text start="1305.03" dur="3.9">they get military support from Turkey</text>
  <text start="1306.95" dur="4.35">and from the other Middle Eastern</text>
  <text start="1308.93" dur="8.94">countries they&amp;#39;re all supporting</text>
  <text start="1311.3" dur="8.82">terrorism at this point so basically</text>
  <text start="1317.87" dur="3.96">Putin is out there saying turkey now</text>
  <text start="1320.12" dur="3.36">supports the Islamic state because</text>
  <text start="1321.83" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;s really what they&amp;#39;re doing they</text>
  <text start="1323.48" dur="5.43">were saving their armed forces on the</text>
  <text start="1326.24" dur="5.64">ground because as we know Russia has</text>
  <text start="1328.91" dur="5.34">been bombing this entire area pushing</text>
  <text start="1331.88" dur="8">the proxy army back and they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="1334.25" dur="8.42">the battle and as we move forward here</text>
  <text start="1339.88" dur="8.16">we&amp;#39;re going to see the provocations</text>
  <text start="1342.67" dur="8.49">continue and get worse as we go on so</text>
  <text start="1348.04" dur="5.25">NATO called an emergency meeting and</text>
  <text start="1351.16" dur="4.18">they wanted to look at the events</text>
  <text start="1353.29" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re saying that everyone should calm</text>
  <text start="1355.34" dur="5.58">down at this point of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1358.45" dur="4.63">absolutely loving this point of it</text>
  <text start="1360.92" dur="3.69">because they&amp;#39;re they brought down a</text>
  <text start="1363.08" dur="6.03">Russian plane</text>
  <text start="1364.61" dur="7.61">and basically you&amp;#39;re going to know that</text>
  <text start="1369.11" dur="7.319">they&amp;#39;re going to try to push this a</text>
  <text start="1372.22" dur="7.06">little bit at a time to try to get the</text>
  <text start="1376.429" dur="6.12">war started Paul Craig Roberts is out</text>
  <text start="1379.28" dur="4.71">there saying that the turkeys unprovoked</text>
  <text start="1382.549" dur="3.931">shoot-down of russian military aircraft</text>
  <text start="1383.99" dur="4.77">over syria raises interesting questions</text>
  <text start="1386.48" dur="4.38">it seems unlikely that the Turkish</text>
  <text start="1388.76" dur="3.81">government would commit an act of war</text>
  <text start="1390.86" dur="6.77">against a much more powerful neighbor</text>
  <text start="1392.57" dur="8.099">unless Washington had cleared the attack</text>
  <text start="1397.63" dur="6.64">well let me just say everything leading</text>
  <text start="1400.669" dur="5.581">up to this they most likely did and now</text>
  <text start="1404.27" dur="7.61">Obama is saying that the moderate Syrian</text>
  <text start="1406.25" dur="8.25">rebels include all the terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="1411.88" dur="5.5">well this is kind of ridiculous because</text>
  <text start="1414.5" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re terrorists and we knew they</text>
  <text start="1417.38" dur="4.62">included all the terrorist groups we</text>
  <text start="1419.21" dur="5.28">knew from the past that they were all</text>
  <text start="1422" dur="4.32">working together there was no such thing</text>
  <text start="1424.49" dur="3.689">as all these separate groups they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="1426.32" dur="4.2">one in the same all being funded by the</text>
  <text start="1428.179" dur="7.591">same thing they&amp;#39;re all getting the</text>

  <text start="1460.49" dur="4.77">would they do this at this point makes</text>
  <text start="1463.669" dur="5.371">no sense unless they&amp;#39;re trying to save</text>

  <text start="1472.76" dur="5.159">intended to destroy all the trucks but</text>
  <text start="1476.33" dur="5.7">what happened was they ran out of</text>
