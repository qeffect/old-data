  <text start="163.03" dur="7.31">entirely and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="166.65" dur="6.7">this is what normally happens the</text>
  <text start="170.34" dur="4.84">establishment pushes back I mean we saw</text>
  <text start="173.35" dur="4.919">it in Greece when the people voted for</text>
  <text start="175.18" dur="6.12">tsipras and Zipporah says you know no</text>

  <text start="185.8" dur="4.04">opposite</text>
  <text start="186.52" dur="7.74">happened he turned on the people and</text>
  <text start="189.84" dur="6.04">made deals with the central banks and we</text>
  <text start="194.26" dur="4.98">can see the same thing is happening in</text>
  <text start="195.88" dur="5.61">the UK so we&amp;#39;ll have to watch this to</text>
  <text start="199.24" dur="4.2">see how this goes but again the people</text>
  <text start="201.49" dur="4.38">voted they didn&amp;#39;t want to be part of the</text>
  <text start="203.44" dur="5.73">EU and they decided you know something</text>
  <text start="205.87" dur="6.03">we voted to remove ourselves and the</text>
  <text start="209.17" dur="3.93">government they are not listening to the</text>
  <text start="211.9" dur="2.34">people and you know what happens to</text>
  <text start="213.1" dur="2.85">governments that don&amp;#39;t listen to the</text>
  <text start="214.24" dur="4.38">people that people finally get pushed</text>
  <text start="215.95" dur="4.44">back into a corner and the people react</text>
  <text start="218.62" dur="5.61">I mean we&amp;#39;ve seen this in history time</text>
  <text start="220.39" dur="6.3">and time again now out in Canada we are</text>
  <text start="224.23" dur="4.95">seeing seeing that the Canadians they</text>
  <text start="226.69" dur="5.73">just set a new record for borrowing</text>
  <text start="229.18" dur="5.1">against their homes and this is not a</text>
  <text start="232.42" dur="3.27">very good sign this is coming from the</text>
  <text start="234.28" dur="4.04">office of the superintendent of</text>
  <text start="235.69" dur="6.36">financial institutions which shows that</text>
  <text start="238.32" dur="5.83">yes after a brief decline in January the</text>
  <text start="242.05" dur="4.17">balance of loans secured by residential</text>
  <text start="244.15" dur="4.59">real estate hit a new high in February</text>
  <text start="246.22" dur="4.38">more interesting is the segment of loans</text>
  <text start="248.74" dur="5.61">being used for the personal consumption</text>
  <text start="250.6" dur="7.199">is growing at the fastest pace in years</text>
  <text start="254.35" dur="5.28">and basically they&amp;#39;re using their homes</text>
  <text start="257.799" dur="4.441">people use over two hundred and eighty</text>
  <text start="259.63" dur="5.64">three billion in home equity to secure</text>
  <text start="262.24" dur="5.85">loans now this is at an all-time high</text>
  <text start="265.27" dur="6.3">right now and what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="268.09" dur="5.67">about all of this is that people are</text>
  <text start="271.57" dur="5.64">taking out loans on their houses the</text>
  <text start="273.76" dur="6.54">houses are at a certain value right now</text>
  <text start="277.21" dur="5.97">and that value is dropping you know what</text>
  <text start="280.3" dur="5.4">happens it puts people underwater as the</text>
  <text start="283.18" dur="3.51">value continually drops and this is what</text>
  <text start="285.7" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;re going to see because the real</text>
  <text start="286.69" dur="5.61">estate market right now is just getting</text>
  <text start="289.39" dur="5.22">worse in Toronto we have seen a thirty</text>
  <text start="292.3" dur="4.83">nine point five percent decline in sales</text>
  <text start="294.61" dur="5.01">over the last year with prices down by</text>
  <text start="297.13" dur="6.06">fourteen percent and falling really fast</text>
  <text start="299.62" dur="5.76">the bubbles are popping right now the</text>
  <text start="303.19" dur="4.44">average price of a house is down around</text>
  <text start="305.38" dur="4.86">nine hundred and fifteen thousand to</text>
  <text start="307.63" dur="6.539">seven hundred and eighty five thousand</text>
  <text start="310.24" dur="5.63">dollars that&amp;#39;s huge and this is just</text>
  <text start="314.169" dur="4.171">going to accelerate to the downside</text>
  <text start="315.87" dur="3.859">London real estate prices have fallen by</text>
  <text start="318.34" dur="5.34">2.6 percent year over</text>
  <text start="319.729" dur="7.56">here and if we look in Miami guess what</text>
  <text start="323.68" dur="7.659">luxury condos in Miami Beach Bal Harbour</text>
  <text start="327.289" dur="6.96">sunny Isle they&amp;#39;re all falling they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="331.339" dur="4.741">declining all these signs point at the</text>
  <text start="334.249" dur="5.551">beginning of the end of this real-estate</text>
  <text start="336.08" dur="9.179">bubble the real-estate storm is now</text>
  <text start="339.8" dur="7.859">hitting the severe stage and moving</text>
  <text start="345.259" dur="4.981">forward guess what things are just going</text>
  <text start="347.659" dur="5.19">to rapidly fall apart and we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="350.24" dur="5.28">lot of these indicators right now where</text>
  <text start="352.849" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;re seeing bubbles pop where people</text>
  <text start="355.52" dur="3.899">are doing the same thing they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="356.539" dur="4.141">back in 2008 where they&amp;#39;re thinking that</text>
  <text start="359.419" dur="2.34">everything is great because most of the</text>
  <text start="360.68" dur="3">people listen to the corporate media and</text>
  <text start="361.759" dur="4.231">they think whoa housing prices are just</text>
  <text start="363.68" dur="4.199">going to keep continually moving up and</text>
  <text start="365.99" dur="3.69">up and up the stock market&amp;#39;s just gonna</text>
  <text start="367.879" dur="4.41">continually moving up everything&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="369.68" dur="4.919">be great and before you know it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="372.289" dur="4.53">taking out loans and investing more into</text>
  <text start="374.599" dur="3.15">the market and everything completely</text>
  <text start="376.819" dur="4.59">falls apart</text>
  <text start="377.749" dur="7.65">these are illusionary bubbles that the</text>
  <text start="381.409" dur="7.31">central banks create to bring people in</text>
  <text start="385.399" dur="6.36">it&amp;#39;s like moths flying towards light</text>
  <text start="388.719" dur="5.98">this is the same thing they want</text>
  <text start="391.759" dur="7.171">everyone in so the big investors who</text>
  <text start="394.699" dur="8.101">pumped these bubbles up they get out the</text>
  <text start="398.93" dur="5.94">small little people get in and they</text>
  <text start="402.8" dur="4.049">bring the market down and all those</text>
  <text start="404.87" dur="3.539">people that got in those are the people</text>
  <text start="406.849" dur="4.35">that are hurt all those people that</text>
  <text start="408.409" dur="5.4">pumped up the bubbles they make out this</text>
  <text start="411.199" dur="5.49">is how they work time and time again and</text>
  <text start="413.809" dur="5.64">they don&amp;#39;t care about who they hurt who</text>
  <text start="416.689" dur="6.301">goes bankrupt who loses their savings</text>
  <text start="419.449" dur="8.101">it&amp;#39;s meaningless to them because their</text>
  <text start="422.99" dur="7.53">system is based on profits it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="427.55" dur="4.679">corporation it&amp;#39;s not they&amp;#39;re not doing</text>
  <text start="430.52" dur="3.359">it for the benefit of the people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="432.229" dur="4.141">doing it for the benefit of themselves</text>
  <text start="433.879" dur="5.46">now Trump is out there and he shot down</text>
  <text start="436.37" dur="6">the TPP he said yeah I looked at it it</text>
  <text start="439.339" dur="5.76">can&amp;#39;t be we worked it&amp;#39;s meant for a</text>
  <text start="442.37" dur="5.37">globalist society we&amp;#39;re going with the</text>
  <text start="445.099" dur="5.16">bile a bilateral trade deals he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="447.74" dur="4.469">meeting with AH BAE and they pretty much</text>
  <text start="450.259" dur="3.341">couldn&amp;#39;t agree on much but they did</text>
  <text start="452.209" dur="4.241">agree on</text>
  <text start="453.6" dur="5.7">trade and Trump right now is sticking to</text>
  <text start="456.45" dur="4.89">the bilateral trade agreement and I</text>
  <text start="459.3" dur="3.69">believe this is the right course right</text>
  <text start="461.34" dur="3.87">now because it keeps everything</text>
  <text start="462.99" dur="3.9">diversified if we have a problem trade</text>
  <text start="465.21" dur="3.6">with this come with this country it</text>
  <text start="466.89" dur="5.22">doesn&amp;#39;t affect trade with another</text>
  <text start="468.81" dur="5.4">country if you&amp;#39;re in the TPP and things</text>
  <text start="472.11" dur="3.72">go wrong it affects almost everything</text>
  <text start="474.21" dur="3.27">but this is what the globalist wanted</text>
  <text start="475.83" dur="4.98">remember they wanted a one-world</text>
  <text start="477.48" dur="5.28">government one currency all countries at</text>
  <text start="480.81" dur="5.43">the same playing level they wanted</text>
  <text start="482.76" dur="5.04">everything exactly the same but we can</text>
  <text start="486.24" dur="3.75">see it&amp;#39;s all being dismantled right now</text>
  <text start="487.8" dur="5.34">that&amp;#39;s the whole point of all of this</text>
  <text start="489.99" dur="6.39">it&amp;#39;s all being dismantled all being set</text>
  <text start="493.14" dur="7.74">up for the major transition now the</text>
  <text start="496.38" dur="6.18">central bankers they know that the</text>
  <text start="500.88" dur="4.11">system is going to be coming down the</text>
  <text start="502.56" dur="3.48">central bankers know exactly what is</text>
  <text start="504.99" dur="2.19">happening because they&amp;#39;re the ones who</text>
  <text start="506.04" dur="3.84">create it they&amp;#39;re the ones who can</text>
  <text start="507.18" dur="5.28">control it and they know what happens</text>
  <text start="509.88" dur="4.11">and they know how to prepare for all</text>
  <text start="512.46" dur="4.11">these things they know what buttons to</text>
  <text start="513.99" dur="5.13">push to make sure that they can get some</text>
  <text start="516.57" dur="4.83">bailouts or some baylin&amp;#39;s or right now</text>
  <text start="519.12" dur="6.03">the European Commission gave its</text>
  <text start="521.4" dur="5.73">blessing to a plan proposed by Italian</text>
  <text start="525.15" dur="4.68">authorities to liquidate small trouble</text>
  <text start="527.13" dur="6.03">banks in Italy with total assets of less</text>
  <text start="529.83" dur="6.18">than three billion euros under the plan</text>
  <text start="533.16" dur="4.89">as a failing bank has resolved its</text>
  <text start="536.01" dur="4.05">assets and his liabilities will be</text>
  <text start="538.05" dur="4.41">transferred to another lender under</text>
  <text start="540.06" dur="4.44">national insolvency proceedings when</text>
  <text start="542.46" dur="4.68">liabilities including deposit exceed the</text>
  <text start="544.5" dur="5.34">value of the good assets mostly loans</text>
  <text start="547.14" dur="4.8">the gap would be dealt with by giving</text>
  <text start="549.84" dur="4.98">haircuts to unsecured creditors</text>
  <text start="551.94" dur="5.13">including insured depositors who would</text>
  <text start="554.82" dur="6.11">then be made whole by a respective</text>
  <text start="557.07" dur="7.89">national deposit guaranteed fund and by</text>
  <text start="560.93" dur="7.51">mobilizing taxpayers now let&amp;#39;s look at</text>
  <text start="564.96" dur="5.67">this for a second by national deposit</text>
  <text start="568.44" dur="7.62">guaranteed fund it&amp;#39;s almost like the</text>
  <text start="570.63" dur="7.68">FDIC now the new resolution plan will be</text>
  <text start="576.06" dur="4.76">available not only for the Italian banks</text>
  <text start="578.31" dur="5.61">but for the eurozone member states and</text>
  <text start="580.82" dur="6.639">each one will have an option to set up</text>
  <text start="583.92" dur="6.269">schemes to support this orderly exit</text>
  <text start="587.459" dur="4.74">small failing banks now the last time</text>
  <text start="590.189" dur="3.661">the European Banking Authority checked</text>
  <text start="592.199" dur="3.901">at the end of 2016</text>
  <text start="593.85" dur="4.32">Italy like Ireland and the Netherlands</text>
  <text start="596.1" dur="5.64">had guaranteed funds equivalent to just</text>
  <text start="598.17" dur="6.539">0.1 percent of covered deposits in Spain</text>
  <text start="601.74" dur="7.56">the figure is around 0.2% in France and</text>
  <text start="604.709" dur="7.92">Germany was around like 0.3% all EU bank</text>
  <text start="609.3" dur="5.94">deposits are guaranteed up to a hundred</text>

  <text start="617.73" dur="4.589">holders are also protected from any</text>
  <text start="619.829" dur="6.091">financial fallout but if a large enough</text>
  <text start="622.319" dur="7.8">Bank collapses in a disorderly enough</text>
  <text start="625.92" dur="6.839">fashion trying to plug this massive</text>
  <text start="630.119" dur="5.22">financial hole it leaves behind can</text>
  <text start="632.759" dur="5.281">suddenly become a very difficult task</text>
  <text start="635.339" dur="5.97">and we&amp;#39;ve seen this in Italy we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="638.04" dur="5.94">in Spain in Spain and we&amp;#39;ve seen it in</text>
  <text start="641.309" dur="6.69">many other countries the problem with</text>
  <text start="643.98" dur="7.169">this is that if things go south there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="647.999" dur="7.411">not gonna be enough in the guaranteed</text>
  <text start="651.149" dur="6.42">fund and we can see yes they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="655.41" dur="4.979">to prepare for this they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="657.569" dur="5.64">prepare for a disaster scenario but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="660.389" dur="4.05">not going to work they don&amp;#39;t have enough</text>
  <text start="663.209" dur="3.09">money and what they think is going to</text>
  <text start="664.439" dur="3.481">happen is maybe one or two banks or</text>
  <text start="666.299" dur="5.16">three banks will go and they&amp;#39;ll be able</text>
  <text start="667.92" dur="6.089">to stop it before there&amp;#39;s a domino</text>
  <text start="671.459" dur="5.25">effect but as we know most of these</text>
  <text start="674.009" dur="4.651">banks are completely insolvent and most</text>
  <text start="676.709" dur="3.54">of these banks are gonna go under and</text>
  <text start="678.66" dur="3.57">they won&amp;#39;t be able to stop it because</text>
  <text start="680.249" dur="3.84">when the ball gets rolling guess what</text>
  <text start="682.23" dur="3.959">it&amp;#39;s gonna get completely out of control</text>
  <text start="684.089" dur="4.55">so what do they do at that point once</text>
  <text start="686.189" dur="5.101">the guaranteed fund is all used up</text>
  <text start="688.639" dur="4.031">they&amp;#39;re gonna shut down the banks close</text>
  <text start="691.29" dur="2.669">everything down it&amp;#39;s going to hit the</text>
  <text start="692.67" dur="3.719">United States the banks are gonna shut</text>
  <text start="693.959" dur="5.13">down here too most of the world that are</text>
  <text start="696.389" dur="5.54">in the private western bank control</text>
  <text start="699.089" dur="5.22">those banks are going to close down and</text>
  <text start="701.929" dur="4.12">most of the governments well they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="704.309" dur="3.81">going to bail out these banks this is</text>
  <text start="706.049" dur="4.801">why they have the bail in documents</text>
  <text start="708.119" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re preparing for this collapse</text>
  <text start="710.85" dur="4.289">scenario so what will do is they&amp;#39;ll shut</text>
  <text start="713.369" dur="5.07">down the banks they&amp;#39;ll tell everyone</text>
  <text start="715.139" dur="5.851">listen you cannot withdraw any of your</text>
  <text start="718.439" dur="4.921">money right now</text>
  <text start="720.99" dur="5.64">we&amp;#39;re putting restrictions on everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="723.36" dur="6.75">accounts you can go to the ATM and take</text>
  <text start="726.63" dur="6.42">out maybe $200 that&amp;#39;s it you can</text>
  <text start="730.11" dur="5.34">transfer to other banks but you cannot</text>
  <text start="733.05" dur="5.52">withdraw your cash because the cash is</text>
  <text start="735.45" dur="5.73">not yours and what we&amp;#39;ll do is we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="738.57" dur="5.07">going to take some of your cash that are</text>
  <text start="741.18" dur="5.58">in these accounts and we&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="743.64" dur="6.48">it to prop up the failing bank that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="746.76" dur="5.94">the key word the failing bank and what</text>
  <text start="750.12" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;ll do is we&amp;#39;ll put a piece of paper</text>
  <text start="752.7" dur="4.32">in your account of course it&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="754.05" dur="4.17">electronic saying that we owe you this</text>
  <text start="757.02" dur="4.11">money I owe you</text>
  <text start="758.22" dur="7.32">once the bank is prosperous once again</text>
  <text start="761.13" dur="7.29">and you know that these Pink&amp;#39;s are going</text>
  <text start="765.54" dur="6.42">to completely collapse on themselves and</text>
  <text start="768.42" dur="6.33">you&amp;#39;re never ever going to see those</text>
  <text start="771.96" dur="5.82">funds they did a test in Cyprus to see</text>
  <text start="774.75" dur="5.4">how people reacted and the test went</text>
  <text start="777.78" dur="3.45">pretty well for the bankers Greece it</text>
  <text start="780.15" dur="2.46">was a little bit more difficult because</text>
  <text start="781.23" dur="3.51">the people realized what happened in</text>
  <text start="782.61" dur="4.71">Cyprus they ran to the banks when their</text>
  <text start="784.74" dur="5.73">country was declining very very rapidly</text>
  <text start="787.32" dur="5.13">at one point and a lot of people started</text>
  <text start="790.47" dur="4.47">to withdraw their funds before it</text>
  <text start="792.45" dur="6.24">happened which made the balance very</text>
  <text start="794.94" dur="6.75">difficult so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="798.69" dur="6.66">is the central bankers they are planning</text>
  <text start="801.69" dur="6.42">for this major collapse scenario we see</text>
  <text start="805.35" dur="6.36">the United States is preparing for a</text>
  <text start="808.11" dur="7.68">collapse a transition and everything is</text>
  <text start="811.71" dur="8.37">being work reworked to accommodate the</text>
  <text start="815.79" dur="6.21">new system and once again you need to be</text>
  <text start="820.08" dur="4.41">prepared and ready for what is coming</text>
  <text start="822" dur="4.05">because again if if you can&amp;#39;t get your</text>
  <text start="824.49" dur="3.21">funds out of the bank and there&amp;#39;s a bank</text>
  <text start="826.05" dur="4.11">holiday that&amp;#39;s what they call it and</text>
  <text start="827.7" dur="5.85">they say you can take out 200 a week or</text>
  <text start="830.16" dur="8.34">300 a week and that&amp;#39;s all you can take</text>
  <text start="833.55" dur="8.79">out and your your actual currency in the</text>
  <text start="838.5" dur="5.73">bank is gone or maybe you only have half</text>
  <text start="842.34" dur="3.69">of it maybe you only have a quarter of</text>
  <text start="844.23" dur="5.73">it they can actually take out the rest</text>
  <text start="846.03" dur="6.36">as an IOU what are you gonna do this is</text>
  <text start="849.96" dur="4.65">why we&amp;#39;ve been saying for the longest</text>
  <text start="852.39" dur="5.28">time make sure you have cash on hand</text>
  <text start="854.61" dur="5.07">make sure you have gold silver to ensure</text>
  <text start="857.67" dur="4.859">your wealth you can have crypto</text>
  <text start="859.68" dur="6.33">currencies which you can move around a</text>
  <text start="862.529" dur="6.031">lot of the stores a lot of the online</text>
  <text start="866.01" dur="4.23">stores they are starting to accept</text>
  <text start="868.56" dur="4.05">cryptocurrency of course the central</text>
  <text start="870.24" dur="3.99">banks are trying to shut the crypto</text>
  <text start="872.61" dur="3.51">market down they&amp;#39;re trying to regulate</text>
  <text start="874.23" dur="3.12">it they&amp;#39;re trying to control it but once</text>
  <text start="876.12" dur="5.67">again it&amp;#39;s gonna be very very difficult</text>
  <text start="877.35" dur="6.78">because as the technology evolves they</text>
  <text start="881.79" dur="4.5">won&amp;#39;t be able to control it because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="884.13" dur="5.49">not centralized everything is not in the</text>
  <text start="886.29" dur="5.609">United States even the exchanges will be</text>
  <text start="889.62" dur="4.32">decentralized around the world</text>
  <text start="891.899" dur="3.331">so regulation is going to be very very</text>
  <text start="893.94" dur="3.54">difficult and this is why the central</text>
  <text start="895.23" dur="5.88">bank the only way they can do it is to</text>
  <text start="897.48" dur="4.919">get every single country in the world to</text>
  <text start="901.11" dur="3.27">have pretty much the same type of</text>
  <text start="902.399" dur="4.141">regulations but those countries that</text>
  <text start="904.38" dur="4.35">aren&amp;#39;t under the Private Western central</text>
  <text start="906.54" dur="3.69">bank rule this is going to be a little</text>
  <text start="908.73" dur="4.62">difficult because they might not agree</text>
  <text start="910.23" dur="4.799">with it and then once again you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="913.35" dur="4.5">control it so it&amp;#39;s going to be very very</text>
  <text start="915.029" dur="6.571">difficult if this was a one-world</text>
  <text start="917.85" dur="6.12">currency globalist type of system yes</text>
  <text start="921.6" dur="6.479">they would have control over all of it</text>
  <text start="923.97" dur="5.64">but because they are not in control and</text>
  <text start="928.079" dur="3.961">they don&amp;#39;t have this system right now</text>
  <text start="929.61" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot more difficult so</text>
  <text start="932.04" dur="4.169">we&amp;#39;re heading towards this transition</text>
  <text start="934.41" dur="3.989">the central bankers are preparing</text>
  <text start="936.209" dur="5.671">themselves everyone is getting prepared</text>
  <text start="938.399" dur="5.731">the economy is declining very very</text>
  <text start="941.88" dur="2.73">rapidly we&amp;#39;re even hearing financial</text>
  <text start="944.13" dur="2.91">pundants</text>
  <text start="944.61" dur="5.58">saying the economy is not doing as well</text>
  <text start="947.04" dur="4.799">as they thought and we know that the Fed</text>
  <text start="950.19" dur="3.329">is very worried about the tariffs we</text>
  <text start="951.839" dur="3.511">know the IMF is very worried about this</text>
  <text start="953.519" dur="4.351">so you could see where this is all</text>
  <text start="955.35" dur="4.83">headed and you could see that the game</text>
  <text start="957.87" dur="5.76">is who&amp;#39;s going to control the narrative</text>
  <text start="960.18" dur="6.54">in the end whoever can force the other</text>
  <text start="963.63" dur="5.19">to collapse the economy and make it look</text>
  <text start="966.72" dur="3.6">like it was their fault they control the</text>
  <text start="968.82" dur="4.259">narrative and I brought that example up</text>
  <text start="970.32" dur="4.86">from 1971 when the central bankers had</text>
  <text start="973.079" dur="3.69">control of everything they were able to</text>
  <text start="975.18" dur="4.099">control the narrative saying that yeah</text>
  <text start="976.769" dur="5.88">the reason why we have a gas shortage</text>
  <text start="979.279" dur="6.731">the reason why you can&amp;#39;t find jobs it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="982.649" dur="4.621">because there&amp;#39;s no fuel it has nothing</text>
  <text start="986.01" dur="2.11">to do with us coming off the gold</text>
  <text start="987.27" dur="2.319">standard</text>
  <text start="988.12" dur="3.75">going onto the petrodollar they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="989.589" dur="3.301">even mention that of course they said</text>
  <text start="991.87" dur="2.52">we&amp;#39;re coming off the gold standard</text>
  <text start="992.89" dur="3.3">because the speculators and then they</text>
  <text start="994.39" dur="3.99">made up stories of why you couldn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="996.19" dur="6.06">fuel why it was very difficult to get</text>
  <text start="998.38" dur="5.67">jobs why it was very difficult to do</text>
  <text start="1002.25" dur="4.32">anything at that point in other</text>
  <text start="1004.05" dur="5.13">countries it was even more difficult so</text>
  <text start="1006.57" dur="5.13">whoever controls the narrative they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1009.18" dur="4.409">control what happens next and this is</text>
  <text start="1011.7" dur="3.889">what Trump is trying to do he&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="1013.589" dur="5.521">to push the central bank in that</text>
  <text start="1015.589" dur="6.071">direction to make it look like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1019.11" dur="3">the cause of all this and of course they</text>
  <text start="1021.66" dur="1.83">are</text>
