  <text start="95.25" dur="4.95">are completely imploding on themselves</text>
  <text start="97.92" dur="4.799">and let&amp;#39;s take a look at the glow at the</text>
  <text start="100.2" dur="5.629">current economic collapse news here now</text>
  <text start="102.719" dur="5.97">we see that the European nations are</text>
  <text start="105.829" dur="5.021">really struggling they&amp;#39;re not doing well</text>
  <text start="108.689" dur="4.201">at all even though the government</text>
  <text start="110.85" dur="3.75">officials are out there telling us that</text>
  <text start="112.89" dur="4.769">everything is fine we&amp;#39;re in a recovery</text>
  <text start="114.6" dur="6.439">the central bankers are telling us we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="117.659" dur="6.99">in a recovery we are not in a recovery</text>
  <text start="121.039" dur="5.021">whatsoever I mean Italy right now they</text>
  <text start="124.649" dur="3.301">are reporting that their unemployment</text>
  <text start="126.06" dur="3.419">rate went from thirteen point six</text>
  <text start="127.95" dur="3.42">percent in the first three months of</text>
  <text start="129.479" dur="4.741">this year and their youth unemployment</text>
  <text start="131.37" dur="4.89">reached forty six percent and this is</text>
  <text start="134.22" dur="4.56">happening to each and every one of the</text>
  <text start="136.26" dur="4.26">countries in the European nations now</text>
  <text start="138.78" dur="4.44">some countries are a little bit worse</text>
  <text start="140.52" dur="4.32">or much worse than others and other</text>
  <text start="143.22" dur="3.78">countries are doing a little bit better</text>
  <text start="144.84" dur="3.93">but eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="147" dur="3.9">this is going to completely spread</text>
  <text start="148.77" dur="4.05">because this debt cannot be sustained</text>
  <text start="150.9" dur="3.66">and those countries that are bringing</text>
  <text start="152.82" dur="4.95">down the rest of the European nations</text>
  <text start="154.56" dur="5.55">need more and more bailouts they need</text>
  <text start="157.77" dur="4.95">more debt which means more austerity</text>
  <text start="160.11" dur="5.67">which means more people without jobs</text>
  <text start="162.72" dur="5.28">which means the country cannot be</text>
  <text start="165.78" dur="4.77">sustained at this time now the EU is</text>
  <text start="168" dur="4.59">warning Greece at this time that they</text>
  <text start="170.55" dur="5.33">are very concerned because of the</text>
  <text start="172.59" dur="6.24">resignation of the top tax collector in</text>
  <text start="175.88" dur="6.43">Greece now we know Greece is having many</text>
  <text start="178.83" dur="5.97">many problems right now many people in</text>
  <text start="182.31" dur="6.41">Greece are finding it very difficult to</text>
  <text start="184.8" dur="6.69">make ends meet the unemployment there is</text>
  <text start="188.72" dur="5.17">very very high the youth unemployment is</text>
  <text start="191.49" dur="5.13">sixty percent and you have to remember</text>
  <text start="193.89" dur="6.15">the youth are the foundation of every</text>
  <text start="196.62" dur="6.87">single country they graduate high school</text>
  <text start="200.04" dur="6.51">or college they move into the working</text>
  <text start="203.49" dur="6.33">sector they find these jobs they bring</text>

  <text start="209.82" dur="7.38">start a family they go to retail markets</text>
  <text start="213.03" dur="6.9">and they buy TVs they buy clothing and</text>
  <text start="217.2" dur="6.42">we are not seeing any of this happen</text>
  <text start="219.93" dur="5.91">because the youth of America just cannot</text>
  <text start="223.62" dur="4.08">find work at this time and in every</text>
  <text start="225.84" dur="4.44">single one of these countries the youth</text>

  <text start="259.83" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re having a very rough time doing</text>
  <text start="262.26" dur="3.9">this now here in the United States</text>
  <text start="263.79" dur="6.09">what&amp;#39;s happening is they are telling us</text>
  <text start="266.16" dur="5.33">right now that the United States is on</text>
  <text start="269.88" dur="4.069">the verge of</text>
  <text start="271.49" dur="5.07">recovering all the jobs that were lost</text>
  <text start="273.949" dur="4.231">during the recession now don&amp;#39;t you feel</text>
  <text start="276.56" dur="3.389">that everything is better at this point</text>

  <text start="303.169" dur="6.021">manipulated numbers that&amp;#39;s it but when</text>
  <text start="306.44" dur="7.349">you look around it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="309.19" dur="7.24">whatsoever if that is true that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="313.789" dur="7.141">only a hundred and thirteen thousand</text>

  <text start="426.35" dur="6.42">market that initial claims now have</text>
  <text start="428.72" dur="7.08">risen by 8,000 and we can see that it</text>

  <text start="452.3" dur="3.9">it didn&amp;#39;t snow in May we know it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="454.31" dur="3.93">the weather because you know May is</text>
  <text start="456.2" dur="5.49">pretty nice it was sunny was getting</text>
  <text start="458.24" dur="6">warmer so we know that layoffs were</text>
  <text start="461.69" dur="4.71">really ramping up from January to now</text>

  <text start="477.02" dur="5.28">biggest annual rise in nine months even</text>

  <text start="482.3" dur="7.14">layoffs around 53,000 was the highest</text>
  <text start="485.45" dur="6.24">since februari 2013 so we can see all</text>

  <text start="494.27" dur="4.41">bombard and come together and what</text>
  <text start="497" dur="3.51">happens is when we go through this</text>

  <text start="520.4" dur="5.97">don&amp;#39;t even meld anymore in the story and</text>
  <text start="523.31" dur="5.58">it makes no sense whatsoever what the</text>
  <text start="526.37" dur="4.83">government is trying to tell us now the</text>
  <text start="528.89" dur="5.22">BRIC nations and many other nations are</text>

  <text start="546.16" dur="5.429">nations are making deals to completely</text>
  <text start="548.379" dur="5.31">bypass the US dollar this is why China</text>

  <text start="567.639" dur="5.64">they realize is now the BRIC nations</text>
  <text start="569.1" dur="7.089">they&amp;#39;re hoping to bankroll a changing</text>

  <text start="603.999" dur="6.541">needs to change this is a dying system</text>
  <text start="607.54" dur="5.07">and we need to completely reset it and</text>
  <text start="610.54" dur="3.779">this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do but</text>
  <text start="612.61" dur="3.779">again the private western central</text>
  <text start="614.319" dur="5.161">vehicles will not let this happen they</text>
  <text start="616.389" dur="6.031">will continue they will continually push</text>
  <text start="619.48" dur="4.649">their agenda trying to put and capture</text>

  <text start="625.99" dur="5.029">western central bank and they will not</text>
  <text start="627.79" dur="6.06">stop doing this now we talked about</text>
  <text start="631.019" dur="4.391">Afghanistan quite often and we realized</text>
  <text start="633.85" dur="3.63">that President Obama was out there and</text>
  <text start="635.41" dur="3.81">he&amp;#39;s like oh yeah we withdrawing the</text>
  <text start="637.48" dur="4.529">troops and we&amp;#39;re going to bring this</text>
  <text start="639.22" dur="5.459">down to hardly any troops and we know</text>
  <text start="642.009" dur="4.74">this is a complete lie we know this is</text>
  <text start="644.679" dur="4.291">not what&amp;#39;s going to happen remember cars</text>
  <text start="646.749" dur="5.46">I would not sign the bilateral security</text>
  <text start="648.97" dur="4.89">deal and if he did sign it that would</text>
  <text start="652.209" dur="4.141">mean the United States would stay in</text>
  <text start="653.86" dur="4.289">Afghanistan for another ten years so at</text>
  <text start="656.35" dur="3.989">this time what they&amp;#39;re waiting for it is</text>
  <text start="658.149" dur="4.23">the election when the new president is</text>
  <text start="660.339" dur="4.141">elected in Afghanistan they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="662.379" dur="4.111">bring up the bilateral security</text>
  <text start="664.48" dur="4.44">agreement once again to the new</text>
  <text start="666.49" dur="5.07">president hoping to force this president</text>

  <text start="671.56" dur="6.51">troops will be there for another 10</text>
  <text start="674.29" dur="6.03">years so you can see what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="678.07" dur="4.44">of course there&amp;#39;s lip service from Obama</text>

  <text start="1035.79" dur="5.039">it doesn&amp;#39;t really seem to work because</text>
  <text start="1037.89" dur="5.64">when you have sanctions for 30 or 40</text>
  <text start="1040.829" dur="6.061">years it pretty much doesn&amp;#39;t work at</text>
  <text start="1043.53" dur="5.67">this point so what are they going to do</text>
  <text start="1046.89" dur="4.169">well the g7 leaders were missing because</text>
  <text start="1049.2" dur="3.75">they kicked Russia out needs to be</text>

  <text start="1322.869" dur="4.861">coming in whatsoever and I believe this</text>

  <text start="1327.73" dur="5.939">they&amp;#39;re closing everything down so they</text>

  <text start="1989.47" dur="5.97">they don&amp;#39;t win this war in Syria they</text>
  <text start="1992.74" dur="6.66">probably most likely will come back to</text>
  <text start="1995.44" dur="6.51">Europe UK United States and we could</text>
  <text start="1999.4" dur="3.99">have a major problem the FBI was already</text>
  <text start="2001.95" dur="2.97">out there telling us that some of them</text>
  <text start="2003.39" dur="2.31">already arrived United States days lost</text>
  <text start="2004.92" dur="3.27">track of that</text>
  <text start="2005.7" dur="6.469">and they know how to make bombs this is</text>
  <text start="2008.19" dur="6.9">why holder has created the homegrown</text>
  <text start="2012.169" dur="5.23">terrorist force searching and looking</text>
  <text start="2015.09" dur="3.78">for domestic terrorism of course that</text>

  <text start="2029.669" dur="5.37">of those who would be a threat to the</text>
  <text start="2032.7" dur="4.709">government powers so we can see they are</text>
  <text start="2035.039" dur="5.941">building this propaganda up continually</text>
  <text start="2037.409" dur="6.061">slowly for this next event and this is</text>
  <text start="2040.98" dur="4.199">exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing and we can</text>
  <text start="2043.47" dur="5.459">see all of this starting to take shape</text>
  <text start="2045.179" dur="7.291">now and pretty much we can say we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2048.929" dur="9.631">already in some type of war with Russia</text>
  <text start="2052.47" dur="8.52">with China with Syria with many of the</text>
  <text start="2058.56" dur="4.859">BRIC nations with China at this time</text>
  <text start="2060.99" dur="4.71">because if you really look around we</text>

  <text start="2085.409" dur="4.381">where you can see what&amp;#39;s happening and</text>
  <text start="2087.3" dur="4.769">the reason why we follow this is to make</text>
