  <text start="53.16" dur="5.04">hi and welcome you listening to the x-22</text>
  <text start="56.76" dur="4.979">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.2" dur="6.33">episode 1363 b and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.739" dur="5.371">August 24th 2017 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="64.53" dur="4.49">episode is it&amp;#39;s so quiet you can hear a</text>
  <text start="67.11" dur="4.44">pin drop is something about to happen</text>
  <text start="69.02" dur="5.47">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="71.55" dur="6.33">political and geopolitical news now as</text>
  <text start="74.49" dur="6.989">we know the Cabal those individuals that</text>
  <text start="77.88" dur="6.599">are trying to make this one-world</text>
  <text start="81.479" dur="5.101">government where the UN has a lot of the</text>
  <text start="84.479" dur="4.261">control of the rights of the people all</text>
  <text start="86.58" dur="4.17">the privileges of the people we know</text>
  <text start="88.74" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to censor everyone</text>
  <text start="90.75" dur="5.399">for quite a while and this is why you</text>
  <text start="92.85" dur="5.28">see YouTube and Google you know putting</text>
  <text start="96.149" dur="3.811">up these algorithms you see Facebook</text>
  <text start="98.13" dur="4.08">Twitter and all these social media sites</text>
  <text start="99.96" dur="4.35">doing the same exact thing and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="102.21" dur="6.75">very interesting about all of this is</text>
  <text start="104.31" dur="6.9">they are pushing censorship quite hard</text>
  <text start="108.96" dur="7.049">right now now The Guardian is out there</text>
  <text start="111.21" dur="8.79">and they are saying that the censoring</text>
  <text start="116.009" dur="6.151">of the Internet is necessary they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="120" dur="4.56">saying some limits must exist and they</text>
  <text start="122.16" dur="3.84">must be enforced but the question we</text>
  <text start="124.56" dur="3.33">always come back to and this is why the</text>
  <text start="126" dur="3.36">founding fathers said you know free</text>
  <text start="127.89" dur="2.789">speech is free speech it doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="129.36" dur="3.18">if it&amp;#39;s hate it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="130.679" dur="4.321">love it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s funny it</text>
  <text start="132.54" dur="4.8">doesn&amp;#39;t matter what it is it&amp;#39;s free you</text>
  <text start="135" dur="5.18">might not like what a person is saying</text>
  <text start="137.34" dur="6.6">but you can&amp;#39;t block it because who</text>
  <text start="140.18" dur="8.47">judges what is free speech and what is</text>
  <text start="143.94" dur="6.75">not free speech so the question the</text>
  <text start="148.65" dur="4.559">Guardian is asking who&amp;#39;s gonna set these</text>
  <text start="150.69" dur="5.72">limits and who then should police them</text>
  <text start="153.209" dur="6.78">now they&amp;#39;re saying the government and</text>
  <text start="156.41" dur="5.1">private companies have a part to play in</text>
  <text start="159.989" dur="8.631">all of this</text>
  <text start="161.51" dur="9.67">no we the people decide what is free and</text>
  <text start="168.62" dur="4.21">what is free speech and what is not and</text>
  <text start="171.18" dur="5.57">according to the United States</text>
  <text start="172.83" dur="6.6">Constitution free speech is any speech</text>
  <text start="176.75" dur="4.87">now of course the government can come</text>
  <text start="179.43" dur="4.2">out with a justification of censorship</text>
  <text start="181.62" dur="4.02">saying oh well we deem that as hate</text>
  <text start="183.63" dur="3.42">speech so that is not allowed well</text>
  <text start="185.64" dur="4.56">hateful to who</text>
  <text start="187.05" dur="6.35">it&amp;#39;s not to every single group again if</text>
  <text start="190.2" dur="7.65">you don&amp;#39;t like it don&amp;#39;t listen</text>
  <text start="193.4" dur="9.04">controlling speech is a very dangerous</text>
  <text start="197.85" dur="7.02">thing especially because who is deciding</text>
  <text start="202.44" dur="6.09">this and this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="204.87" dur="6.18">push by covering statues by taking them</text>
  <text start="208.53" dur="5.94">down telling you what you should see and</text>
  <text start="211.05" dur="4.98">not see next it will be book burning</text>
  <text start="214.47" dur="3.9">because these books are no good it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="216.03" dur="5.34">filled with all hate so let&amp;#39;s burn them</text>
  <text start="218.37" dur="5.25">I mean look at this slippery slope we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="221.37" dur="5.7">headed towards it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="223.62" dur="5.79">scary but a lot of people don&amp;#39;t see it</text>
  <text start="227.07" dur="4.8">this way a lot of people say this is a</text>
  <text start="229.41" dur="4.59">good thing well it&amp;#39;s not a good thing</text>
  <text start="231.87" dur="5.46">this is what the founding fathers fought</text>
  <text start="234" dur="6.09">against this is why they placed all</text>
  <text start="237.33" dur="5.79">these rights in this document so</text>
  <text start="240.09" dur="5.19">soldiers or another government couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="243.12" dur="4.65">come in and just you know look through</text>
  <text start="245.28" dur="4.98">your things that you couldn&amp;#39;t put up you</text>
  <text start="247.77" dur="4.61">couldn&amp;#39;t be put on trial without you</text>
  <text start="250.26" dur="4.44">know due process</text>
  <text start="252.38" dur="5.26">you need a warrant to search someone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="254.7" dur="5.07">house you can freely object to the</text>
  <text start="257.64" dur="3.75">government you can freely say things</text>
  <text start="259.77" dur="4.05">about the government without the</text>
  <text start="261.39" dur="5.279">government arresting you and putting you</text>
  <text start="263.82" dur="4.11">in jail or executing you and this has</text>
  <text start="266.669" dur="4.371">happened in the past and it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="267.93" dur="6.12">happening in many countries now a</text>
  <text start="271.04" dur="4.81">District of Columbia federal judge they</text>
  <text start="274.05" dur="4.38">have approved a government warrant</text>
  <text start="275.85" dur="5.28">seeking information about users and</text>
  <text start="278.43" dur="5.31">subscribers to an anti-trump website</text>
  <text start="281.13" dur="6.6">which has been linked to rioting during</text>
  <text start="283.74" dur="7.32">the presidential inauguration in DC but</text>
  <text start="287.73" dur="5.85">the judge added protections to safeguard</text>
  <text start="291.06" dur="5.42">innocent users now Chief Judge Robert</text>
  <text start="293.58" dur="7.19">Morin rule that DreamHost</text>
  <text start="296.48" dur="8.16">remember they created disrupt j-20 org</text>
  <text start="300.77" dur="7.18">this is part of the anti feh movement</text>
  <text start="304.64" dur="6.19">they&amp;#39;re saying that we want some of</text>
  <text start="307.95" dur="5.43">these individuals data we want their</text>
  <text start="310.83" dur="5.19">names we want the address and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="313.38" dur="5.43">going to be looking into this now we can</text>
  <text start="316.02" dur="4.56">see right now Morin you said he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="318.81" dur="2.819">to oversee and review the data</text>
  <text start="320.58" dur="3.45">also said that the government must</text>
  <text start="321.629" dur="3.811">explain what protocols that we&amp;#39;ll use to</text>
  <text start="324.03" dur="4.25">make sure that the data of innocent</text>
  <text start="325.44" dur="5.099">users is not seized by prosecutors and</text>
  <text start="328.28" dur="4.33">he went on to say that he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="330.539" dur="3.69">balance the First Amendment protections</text>
  <text start="332.61" dur="5.369">and the government needs for this</text>
  <text start="334.229" dur="7.201">information to see who was the cause of</text>
  <text start="337.979" dur="6.78">this who was pushing the agenda who is</text>
  <text start="341.43" dur="5.43">damaging property and this is the first</text>
  <text start="344.759" dur="4.021">stage to look into this group and to see</text>
  <text start="346.86" dur="4.559">what exactly has been going on because</text>
  <text start="348.78" dur="5.789">there are certain individuals that they</text>
  <text start="351.419" dur="5.911">have arrested for this and they want to</text>
  <text start="354.569" dur="4.981">know who else was a part of this and we</text>
  <text start="357.33" dur="3.63">saw this in Charlottesville where all of</text>
  <text start="359.55" dur="3.179">a sudden and Tifa came out of nowhere</text>
  <text start="360.96" dur="4.079">they didn&amp;#39;t have a permit or anything</text>
  <text start="362.729" dur="5.131">like that they came out and they started</text>
  <text start="365.039" dur="5.28">swinging and causing a huge problem in</text>
  <text start="367.86" dur="5.04">this protest which of course escalated</text>
  <text start="370.319" dur="5.91">into something much much larger now we</text>
  <text start="372.9" dur="6.509">see there&amp;#39;s another death of a Russian a</text>
  <text start="376.229" dur="5.961">Russian ambassador to Sudan now he had a</text>
  <text start="379.409" dur="5.671">heart attack he was 62 years old</text>
  <text start="382.19" dur="6.129">appeared to have symptoms of consistent</text>
  <text start="385.08" dur="4.98">with a series of heart seizures and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="388.319" dur="3.991">saying that doctors were immediately</text>
  <text start="390.06" dur="5.009">called to the scene but they were unable</text>
  <text start="392.31" dur="6.449">to resuscitate him we&amp;#39;ll bring them back</text>
  <text start="395.069" dur="6.511">to life and we can see that this has</text>
  <text start="398.759" dur="6.63">happened to many different Russian</text>
  <text start="401.58" dur="7.589">diplomats and we know that the CIA they</text>
  <text start="405.389" dur="8.821">do have a device that can cause a heart</text>
  <text start="409.169" dur="6.511">attack so the question is was this use</text>
  <text start="414.21" dur="2.88">right now there is no proof and it</text>
  <text start="415.68" dur="3.479">doesn&amp;#39;t really leave any evidence</text>
  <text start="417.09" dur="3.99">but they&amp;#39;ve used it in the past actually</text>
  <text start="419.159" dur="4.401">it&amp;#39;s been shown to the public through</text>
  <text start="421.08" dur="5.76">court hearings and we know they have</text>
  <text start="423.56" dur="5.469">more advanced type of weaponry where</text>
  <text start="426.84" dur="5.37">they can pull something like this off</text>
  <text start="429.029" dur="5.101">and they can use it now Lavrov is out</text>
  <text start="432.21" dur="5.94">there and he&amp;#39;s saying that trumps plan</text>
  <text start="434.13" dur="7.68">is the worst possible plan he&amp;#39;s ever</text>
  <text start="438.15" dur="5.699">seen for Afghanistan Lavrov stated the</text>
  <text start="441.81" dur="3.81">main emphasis in the new strategy which</text>
  <text start="443.849" dur="4.38">was announced by Washington has made on</text>
  <text start="445.62" dur="5.4">settlement through use of force we</text>
  <text start="448.229" dur="5.701">believe that it&amp;#39;s a dead end approach he</text>
  <text start="451.02" dur="3.33">continued if I&amp;#39;ve got the new US</text>
  <text start="453.93" dur="2.43">strategy</text>
  <text start="454.35" dur="4.02">right it allows contacts with the</text>
  <text start="456.36" dur="4.32">Taliban without them fulfilling any</text>
  <text start="458.37" dur="4.32">conditions at all I don&amp;#39;t think that is</text>
  <text start="460.68" dur="3.45">go that goes in line with our joint</text>
  <text start="462.69" dur="3.27">interest to follow the negotiated</text>
  <text start="464.13" dur="4.14">coordinated line which is approved by</text>
  <text start="465.96" dur="4.53">the UN Security Council but I hope that</text>
  <text start="468.27" dur="3.84">within the framework of the expert level</text>
  <text start="470.49" dur="4.26">context we have with our American</text>
  <text start="472.11" dur="5.61">colleagues we will be able to clarify</text>
  <text start="474.75" dur="6.96">this apparent contradiction and once</text>
  <text start="477.72" dur="7.88">again I&amp;#39;ll say it I don&amp;#39;t think this</text>
  <text start="481.71" dur="5.07">plan is for the United States to stay in</text>
  <text start="485.6" dur="3.43">Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="486.78" dur="4.62">I believe it is to search and destroy</text>
  <text start="489.03" dur="6.57">and remove the terrorists it is to</text>
  <text start="491.4" dur="5.91">destroy the funding of the paid</text>
  <text start="495.6" dur="6">mercenaries around the world by</text>
  <text start="497.31" dur="7.26">destroying these poppy fields and once</text>
  <text start="501.6" dur="4.86">this all happens everything&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="504.57" dur="3.45">be turned over to the government it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="506.46" dur="6.3">going to be turned over to China to</text>
  <text start="508.02" dur="7.019">Russia to work out some type of deal now</text>
  <text start="512.76" dur="4.529">people have some other opinions about</text>
  <text start="515.039" dur="6.241">this and I agree with those opinions</text>
  <text start="517.289" dur="6.511">also Trump might be compromised he might</text>
  <text start="521.28" dur="4.95">be with the neocons with the Cabal this</text>
  <text start="523.8" dur="6.84">might be a plan to keep the United</text>
  <text start="526.23" dur="7.8">States in Afghanistan forever doing the</text>
  <text start="530.64" dur="4.92">bidding of the Cabal but there are</text>
  <text start="534.03" dur="3.84">certain things that he said and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="535.56" dur="4.17">gonna have to wait and see how this</text>
  <text start="537.87" dur="4.89">turns out because if we look at his</text>
  <text start="539.73" dur="7.35">actions in Syria he stopped the funding</text>
  <text start="542.76" dur="6.81">to the moderate rebels he&amp;#39;s not giving</text>
  <text start="547.08" dur="4.08">the weaponry to the paid mercenaries</text>
  <text start="549.57" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re being destroyed right now yes</text>
  <text start="551.16" dur="5.07">there are factions within the armed</text>
  <text start="554.76" dur="4.59">forces that are still controlled by the</text>
  <text start="556.23" dur="6.44">Cabal and they are trying to help the</text>
  <text start="559.35" dur="6.51">paid mercenaries and we can see that</text>
  <text start="562.67" dur="6.46">they Trump made a deal for a ceasefire</text>
  <text start="565.86" dur="5.28">and it is holding we see the escalation</text>
  <text start="569.13" dur="5.43">zones are being set up in Syria and</text>
  <text start="571.14" dur="6.54">Russia and Syria they&amp;#39;ve almost cleared</text>
  <text start="574.56" dur="9.32">the country and blocked off most of the</text>
  <text start="577.68" dur="10.35">border around Syria so why is</text>
  <text start="583.88" dur="8.44">Afghanistan so important to the Cabal</text>
  <text start="588.03" dur="7.95">remember they have veins of iron copper</text>
  <text start="592.32" dur="5.4">cobalt gold lithium this is a strategic</text>
  <text start="595.98" dur="3.33">raw material which is used in the</text>
  <text start="597.72" dur="2.76">production of high-tech batteries for</text>
  <text start="599.31" dur="5.58">laptop cell phones</text>
  <text start="600.48" dur="7.14">electric cars and we can see that they</text>
  <text start="604.89" dur="5.88">have oil and it&amp;#39;s a strategic location</text>
  <text start="607.62" dur="6.08">Russia and China are there and the US</text>
  <text start="610.77" dur="5.52">the Cabal have been in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="613.7" dur="5.14">protecting the poppy fields and trying</text>
  <text start="616.29" dur="5.01">to stop China and Russia from working</text>
  <text start="618.84" dur="6.27">out deals with Afghanistan but it has</text>
  <text start="621.3" dur="6.03">not worked at all China and Russia</text>
  <text start="625.11" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;ve been setting up infrastructure</text>
  <text start="627.33" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;ve been working with Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="629.61" dur="5.72">they&amp;#39;re helping them mine all these</text>
  <text start="633.09" dur="4.65">different natural resources and the</text>
  <text start="635.33" dur="6.13">United States the Cabal</text>
  <text start="637.74" dur="4.68">they can&amp;#39;t stop them and with the number</text>
  <text start="641.46" dur="2.73">of troops that are going into</text>
  <text start="642.42" dur="3.45">Afghanistan it&amp;#39;s not going to help</text>
  <text start="644.19" dur="3.9">remember Obama he sent something like a</text>
  <text start="645.87" dur="4.83">hundred thousand troops in there it</text>
  <text start="648.09" dur="6.12">didn&amp;#39;t do anything didn&amp;#39;t clear out all</text>
  <text start="650.7" dur="5.04">the terrorists because it was a ruse it</text>
  <text start="654.21" dur="4.05">wasn&amp;#39;t really good they weren&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="655.74" dur="4.44">really going in there to stop terrorists</text>
  <text start="658.26" dur="5.19">they were trying to push Russia and</text>
  <text start="660.18" dur="6.45">China out of the area by having a lot of</text>
  <text start="663.45" dur="7.65">troops there creating chaos in the</text>
  <text start="666.63" dur="6.84">region but it didn&amp;#39;t work and this is</text>
  <text start="671.1" dur="4.68">why we see what is happening today and</text>
  <text start="673.47" dur="5.43">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to wait to see what</text>
  <text start="675.78" dur="5.58">does occur as time goes on what will be</text>
  <text start="678.9" dur="6">the actions of Trump he says one thing</text>
  <text start="681.36" dur="5.82">let&amp;#39;s see what his actions are now we</text>
  <text start="684.9" dur="4.43">can see that North Korea is still a hot</text>
  <text start="687.18" dur="4.68">spot Germany is out there saying listen</text>
  <text start="689.33" dur="4.12">Germany will not automatically sign with</text>
  <text start="691.86" dur="4.71">the US and the war with North Korea</text>
  <text start="693.45" dur="7.41">doesn&amp;#39;t mean if the u.s. starts a war</text>

  <text start="706.56" dur="3.96">certain deals with Russia they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="708.63" dur="4.29">want these sanctions their economies</text>
  <text start="710.52" dur="5.37">hurting because of these sanctions if</text>

  <text start="715.89" dur="4.56">countries they are hurting because of</text>
  <text start="718.53" dur="4.74">the sanctions and we can see</text>
  <text start="720.45" dur="5.82">that the Cabal they want a war with</text>
  <text start="723.27" dur="5.19">North Korea and they&amp;#39;re doing whatever</text>
  <text start="726.27" dur="5.16">they possibly can to start this war now</text>

  <text start="733.92" dur="5.49">borders up against North Korea they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="736.29" dur="5.58">been flying the tupolev 95 m/s bear</text>
  <text start="739.41" dur="4.62">bombers they flew over neutral waters</text>
  <text start="741.87" dur="5.31">and they were accompanied by Russian</text>
  <text start="744.03" dur="6.18">Sukhoi 35 s fighters and they were</text>
  <text start="747.18" dur="4.89">patrolling the area this was a flight</text>
  <text start="750.21" dur="4.35">that was pre-planned it was a scheduled</text>
  <text start="752.07" dur="5.94">flight over neutral waters and we can</text>
  <text start="754.56" dur="4.92">see right now they border North Korea</text>
  <text start="758.01" dur="3.42">and it makes sense that they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="759.48" dur="4.74">flying their bombers over there does it</text>
  <text start="761.43" dur="5.37">mean that we&amp;#39;re going to war no it means</text>
  <text start="764.22" dur="5.19">they are doing a routine flight just</text>
  <text start="766.8" dur="4.86">like they fly between Alaska and Russia</text>
  <text start="769.41" dur="4.2">and of course the United States the</text>
  <text start="771.66" dur="3.42">corporate media is out there saying oh</text>
  <text start="773.61" dur="4.5">my god Russia&amp;#39;s coming for us</text>
  <text start="775.08" dur="5.49">Russia is not going to attack anyone I</text>
  <text start="778.11" dur="5.07">don&amp;#39;t think North Korea is going to</text>
  <text start="780.57" dur="5.61">attack anyone first of all Russia if</text>
  <text start="783.18" dur="4.47">they really wanted to start a war they</text>
  <text start="786.18" dur="3.27">would have done it already I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="787.65" dur="4.77">this many many times before they had</text>
  <text start="789.45" dur="5.97">their chance in Syria back in 2013 they</text>
  <text start="792.42" dur="5.58">had their chance in Syria in 2015-2016</text>
  <text start="795.42" dur="5.88">they had their chance in Ukraine they</text>
  <text start="798" dur="5.88">could have started an all-out war but</text>
  <text start="801.3" dur="5.22">guess what they went the opposite way</text>
  <text start="803.88" dur="6.09">and they talked about peace they</text>
  <text start="806.52" dur="7.05">implemented different deals to have</text>
  <text start="809.97" dur="6.66">peace in the region the United States on</text>
  <text start="813.57" dur="6.45">the other hand the Cabal well they</text>
  <text start="816.63" dur="5.97">wanted war and of course we always heard</text>
  <text start="820.02" dur="5.19">the red line we always heard if somebody</text>
  <text start="822.6" dur="5.22">crosses the red line we are going to war</text>
  <text start="825.21" dur="4.98">now Russia they&amp;#39;re trying to get the</text>
  <text start="827.82" dur="4.71">rival Libyan government&amp;#39;s to sit down at</text>
  <text start="830.19" dur="5.34">a table in Moscow and we have general</text>
  <text start="832.53" dur="4.62">hrothgar who is fighting the puppet</text>
  <text start="835.53" dur="4.29">government that the United States and</text>
  <text start="837.15" dur="5.25">the UN and the coalition forces put into</text>
  <text start="839.82" dur="4.5">Libya without speaking to the Libyan</text>
  <text start="842.4" dur="3.75">people without having elections they</text>
  <text start="844.32" dur="4.56">decided we&amp;#39;re going to form the new</text>
  <text start="846.15" dur="5.85">government without elections democracy</text>
  <text start="848.88" dur="5.05">at its best and we can see there are</text>
  <text start="852" dur="4.3">certain factions within Libya</text>
  <text start="853.93" dur="5.909">you don&amp;#39;t want this the people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="856.3" dur="7.5">want this and right now Russia is trying</text>
  <text start="859.839" dur="6.241">to speak to all sides they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="863.8" dur="6.659">have everyone sit down at a table and</text>
  <text start="866.08" dur="5.73">Trump has said listen hands off on Libya</text>
  <text start="870.459" dur="4.741">we&amp;#39;re not gonna get involved in this</text>
  <text start="871.81" dur="5.79">whatsoever so Russia right now does have</text>
  <text start="875.2" dur="6.36">the upper hand and I believe that</text>
  <text start="877.6" dur="7.739">they&amp;#39;re going to have peace in Libya</text>
  <text start="881.56" dur="6.24">they will have elections they will have</text>
  <text start="885.339" dur="5.581">a government that is chosen by the</text>
  <text start="887.8" dur="5.96">people we see that the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="890.92" dur="5.58">they have asked the Syrian army and</text>
  <text start="893.76" dur="4.87">Hezbollah to let it withdraw from</text>
  <text start="896.5" dur="6">Syria&amp;#39;s border with Lebanon now remember</text>
  <text start="898.63" dur="5.1">Lebanon Jordan Iraq they&amp;#39;re closing</text>
  <text start="902.5" dur="4.589">their borders they&amp;#39;re cutting everything</text>
  <text start="903.73" dur="6.33">off and the Islamic state they have no</text>
  <text start="907.089" dur="6.241">place to go they&amp;#39;re trying to retreat to</text>
  <text start="910.06" dur="5.52">Deir al-zor this is where Russia is</text>
  <text start="913.33" dur="4.29">bombing like crazy with the Syrian armed</text>
  <text start="915.58" dur="4.23">forces and this is a huge problem for</text>
  <text start="917.62" dur="5.219">the Islamic state so what do we see</text>
  <text start="919.81" dur="5.94">happening here well we see Netanyahu who</text>
  <text start="922.839" dur="5.491">is the Prime Minister of Israel he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="925.75" dur="6.57">meeting with Putin and he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="928.33" dur="8.31">convince Putin that Iran&amp;#39;s influence in</text>
  <text start="932.32" dur="6.269">Syria will come with conflict no that is</text>
  <text start="936.64" dur="6.51">not true whatsoever what he&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="938.589" dur="9">saying is listen if Iran and Syria work</text>
  <text start="943.15" dur="7.71">together we can&amp;#39;t get into Syria we can</text>
  <text start="947.589" dur="5.881">then not get into Iran and this is going</text>
  <text start="950.86" dur="6.45">to be a problem in this area remember</text>
  <text start="953.47" dur="6.84">Syria invited Iran into their country to</text>
  <text start="957.31" dur="5.34">help out with the paid mercenaries and</text>
  <text start="960.31" dur="4.95">right now we can see Netanyahu&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="962.65" dur="3.27">to convince Putin that this is not a</text>
  <text start="965.26" dur="2.76">good thing</text>
  <text start="965.92" dur="4.169">Iran is working with China Iran is</text>
  <text start="968.02" dur="5.189">working with Russia Iran is working with</text>
  <text start="970.089" dur="6.961">Syria they&amp;#39;re already making deals by</text>
  <text start="973.209" dur="5.94">passing the dollar and right now we can</text>
  <text start="977.05" dur="5.039">see with the u.s. Netanyahu and the rest</text>
  <text start="979.149" dur="5.011">and the coalition forces the entire plan</text>
  <text start="982.089" dur="5.191">in the Middle East it is completely</text>
  <text start="984.16" dur="5.07">falling apart but we can see the</text>
  <text start="987.28" dur="4.89">deep state the Cabal they haven&amp;#39;t given</text>
  <text start="989.23" dur="7.41">up and we can see that they put a rubber</text>
  <text start="992.17" dur="7.49">stamp on the gas attacks in Syria saying</text>
  <text start="996.64" dur="5.94">that yes it was Assad and Russia</text>
  <text start="999.66" dur="5.59">sakharova she is out there saying listen</text>

  <text start="1005.25" dur="5.81">is guilty of a chemical attack four</text>
  <text start="1006.9" dur="9">years ago and we&amp;#39;re still waiting for</text>
  <text start="1011.06" dur="7.45">the u.s. to present proof you haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1015.9" dur="5.04">shown us any proof but you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1018.51" dur="6.439">automatically saying that this is true</text>
  <text start="1020.94" dur="6.99">you&amp;#39;re saying it without the proof and</text>
  <text start="1024.949" dur="5.951">Russia again is saying we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1027.93" dur="6.42">accepting this the UN should not accept</text>
  <text start="1030.9" dur="6.33">this because you need to back up what</text>
  <text start="1034.35" dur="4.29">you&amp;#39;re saying but propaganda can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="1037.23" dur="4.38">backed up with proof because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1038.64" dur="6.75">propaganda so what I see happening right</text>
