  <text start="96.24" dur="5.609">collapse of the system at this point we</text>
  <text start="98.34" dur="7.25">realize that they&amp;#39;ve created this</text>
  <text start="101.849" dur="6.811">illusion out of bubbles out of creating</text>
  <text start="105.59" dur="6.1">currency out of thin air by propping up</text>
  <text start="108.66" dur="5.79">banks where banks then propped up the</text>
  <text start="111.69" dur="5.489">stock market where the Fed stepped in</text>
  <text start="114.45" dur="5.82">and bought up all that toxic real estate</text>
  <text start="117.179" dur="8.121">took it off the bank&amp;#39;s books where they</text>
  <text start="120.27" dur="6.659">manipulated numbers for unemployment GDP</text>

  <text start="144.54" dur="4.29">layoff now each state is different but</text>
  <text start="146.91" dur="3.87">this is the way the system works GDP</text>
  <text start="148.83" dur="4.5">they went back to nineteen twenty-nine</text>
  <text start="150.78" dur="5.52">they included research and development</text>
  <text start="153.33" dur="5.1">and other things into GDP and then</text>
  <text start="156.3" dur="7.56">recalculated moving up to the present</text>
  <text start="158.43" dur="7.62">day they added Obamacare into this and</text>
  <text start="163.86" dur="6.17">we know they keep revising the numbers</text>
  <text start="166.05" dur="7.62">back and forth to create the illusion of</text>
  <text start="170.03" dur="6.73">this economic recovery well it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="176.76" dur="5.6">there who believe that it were in one</text>
  <text start="179.07" dur="7.14">but we&amp;#39;re not there are too many</text>
  <text start="182.36" dur="7.18">indicators at this point pointing to the</text>
  <text start="186.21" dur="6.09">system collapsing inward it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="189.54" dur="5.78">implosion and it&amp;#39;s not just here in the</text>
  <text start="192.3" dur="5.4">United States we&amp;#39;re seeing it in Britain</text>
  <text start="195.32" dur="4.57">where they&amp;#39;re showing that their retail</text>
  <text start="197.7" dur="5.55">sales they have fallen more than</text>
  <text start="199.89" dur="7.47">expected in February and there are signs</text>
  <text start="203.25" dur="6.48">that the economy in Britain has slowed</text>
  <text start="207.36" dur="4.379">in early 2016 and the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="209.73" dur="5.61">official budget forecasters said you</text>
  <text start="211.739" dur="8.731">know what it doesn&amp;#39;t look good this</text>
  <text start="215.34" dur="8.46">entire year it&amp;#39;s going to be weak for</text>
  <text start="220.47" dur="5.76">the rest of this year we see France is</text>
  <text start="223.8" dur="5.4">out there saying okay our unemployment</text>
  <text start="226.23" dur="5.61">has gone up again by 1.1 percent in the</text>
  <text start="229.2" dur="5.73">month of februari pushing jobless</text>
  <text start="231.84" dur="9.6">numbers to a record 3.59 1 million</text>
  <text start="234.93" dur="9.72">people I remember back in August of 2013</text>
  <text start="241.44" dur="5.34">to be very specific when President</text>
  <text start="244.65" dur="4.71">Hollande came out and this was during</text>
  <text start="246.78" dur="6.53">the time we were having that false flag</text>
  <text start="249.36" dur="6.36">the sarin gas false flag in Syria where</text>
  <text start="253.31" dur="5.38">Obama was out there also saying that</text>
  <text start="255.72" dur="5.87">real estate is improving he was in</text>
  <text start="258.69" dur="6.93">Phoenix president Hollande said listen</text>
  <text start="261.59" dur="6.13">looks like the French economy is taking</text>
  <text start="265.62" dur="4.02">off it&amp;#39;s going to be much much better</text>
  <text start="267.72" dur="6.54">now we&amp;#39;re going to reduce unemployment</text>
  <text start="269.64" dur="7.35">and when we go from that period to this</text>
  <text start="274.26" dur="4.71">period we see that nothing has changed</text>
  <text start="276.99" dur="4.44">at all actually it has changed it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="278.97" dur="7.14">gotten a lot worse everything they told</text>
  <text start="281.43" dur="6.36">us is not working now in certain parts</text>
  <text start="286.11" dur="5.13">of Canada we see the real estate bubble</text>
  <text start="287.79" dur="5.55">is deflating it&amp;#39;s going to pop and</text>
  <text start="291.24" dur="4.2">what&amp;#39;s very interesting in Vancouver</text>
  <text start="293.34" dur="3.16">prices have surged by twenty six percent</text>
  <text start="295.44" dur="4.09">in</text>
  <text start="296.5" dur="6.9">februari and we&amp;#39;re seeing this gigantic</text>
  <text start="299.53" dur="6.66">real estate bubble in Vancouver blowing</text>
  <text start="303.4" dur="6.9">up like crazy and the reason for this is</text>
  <text start="306.19" dur="6.54">that the Chinese are taking their funds</text>
  <text start="310.3" dur="5.61">their currency and they&amp;#39;re stuffing it</text>
  <text start="312.73" dur="6.81">into real estate and Vancouver the</text>
  <text start="315.91" dur="7.65">Chinese right now they have spent twelve</text>
  <text start="319.54" dur="7.86">point seven billion dollars in Greater</text>
  <text start="323.56" dur="6.69">Vancouver area which accounts for thirty</text>
  <text start="327.4" dur="5.19">three percent of total sales in that</text>
  <text start="330.25" dur="4.08">area so it&amp;#39;s not the Canadian people</text>
  <text start="332.59" dur="4.76">that are going out and saying hey I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="334.33" dur="6.39">going to purchase this no its foreign</text>
  <text start="337.35" dur="5.11">investors coming into the country doing</text>
  <text start="340.72" dur="3.72">this we&amp;#39;re seeing this just not in</text>
  <text start="342.46" dur="4.92">Canada we&amp;#39;ve seen this in the United</text>
  <text start="344.44" dur="5.82">States and this is pumped up the market</text>
  <text start="347.38" dur="5.43">we have seen hedge fund&amp;#39;s investment</text>
  <text start="350.26" dur="4.5">companies doing the same thing the</text>
  <text start="352.81" dur="3.57">everyday person in canada the united</text>
  <text start="354.76" dur="6.18">states that are sitting on the sidelines</text>
  <text start="356.38" dur="8.33">right now because guess what they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="360.94" dur="6">have the funds to purchase real estate</text>
  <text start="364.71" dur="4.45">here in the united states we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="366.94" dur="5.42">very odd things the initial jobless</text>
  <text start="369.16" dur="5.79">claims they&amp;#39;re hovering at 43 year lows</text>
  <text start="372.36" dur="5.44">but it&amp;#39;s very interesting about this is</text>
  <text start="374.95" dur="5.94">that this is showing that no one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="377.8" dur="6.57">applying for any type of unemployment</text>
  <text start="380.89" dur="5.96">insurance whatsoever but we see the is M</text>
  <text start="384.37" dur="6.02">composite employing employment index</text>
  <text start="386.85" dur="7.84">doing the opposite we see manufacturing</text>
  <text start="390.39" dur="8.47">doing the opposite we see more layoffs</text>
  <text start="394.69" dur="6.6">coming from these sectors and at the</text>
  <text start="398.86" dur="5.52">same time initial jobless claims are</text>
  <text start="401.29" dur="5.22">falling we see corporations continually</text>
  <text start="404.38" dur="4.41">laying off people but initial jobless</text>
  <text start="406.51" dur="6.12">claims are falling we see the retail</text>
  <text start="408.79" dur="6.8">sector they&amp;#39;re laying off people closing</text>
  <text start="412.63" dur="8.07">stores but the initial jobless claims is</text>
  <text start="415.59" dur="8.47">at 43 year lows so again someone is</text>
  <text start="420.7" dur="5.07">lying and we know who it is we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="424.06" dur="5.07">the government we know it&amp;#39;s the central</text>
  <text start="425.77" dur="4.56">bank now market is out there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="429.13" dur="3.45">warning the US</text>
  <text start="430.33" dur="5.88">is going through its worst growth spell</text>
  <text start="432.58" dur="7.639">for three and a half years the worst may</text>
  <text start="436.21" dur="8.79">come and this is a great concern saying</text>

  <text start="470.979" dur="7.011">dropped by 0.5% and we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>

  <text start="695.11" dur="3.719">no</text>
  <text start="696.61" dur="5.13">but we know at some point that this</text>
  <text start="698.829" dur="6.121">entire thing will come crumbling down it</text>
  <text start="701.74" dur="4.68">will crash and it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot</text>
  <text start="704.95" dur="2.879">worse than two thousand eight now</text>

  <text start="747.49" dur="8.46">down the same exact path and at this</text>
  <text start="751.089" dur="7.971">point at this point in time we can see</text>
  <text start="755.95" dur="6.749">as the market fluctuates at the top here</text>
  <text start="759.06" dur="6.87">to get all the smart money out there</text>
  <text start="762.699" dur="6.421">getting ready to let this completely go</text>

  <text start="792.19" dur="5.25">personal opinion from looking at</text>
  <text start="793.63" dur="7.17">everything and going back in time and</text>
  <text start="797.44" dur="7.28">looking at all the reports and how</text>

  <text start="804.72" dur="9.22">I&amp;#39;m starting to see a lot of</text>
  <text start="807.339" dur="10.051">similarities of 2008 and if everything</text>
  <text start="813.94" dur="6.93">that I&amp;#39;m looking at is correct I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="817.39" dur="6.15">know how much time we have left here yes</text>
  <text start="820.87" dur="5.64">can they pump it up once again can they</text>

  <text start="830.17" dur="5.03">is going to be more companies laying off</text>
  <text start="832.269" dur="6.06">more retail stores shutting down and</text>
  <text start="835.2" dur="7.87">more and more people losing their jobs</text>
  <text start="838.329" dur="8.221">and as this continues and it has a</text>
  <text start="843.07" dur="5.819">compound effect the entire illusion will</text>
  <text start="846.55" dur="7.86">unravel and it will fall apart and they</text>
  <text start="848.889" dur="10.56">know this and it seems like we are so</text>
  <text start="854.41" dur="9.419">close there to that point that I have a</text>
  <text start="859.449" dur="7.351">pit in my stomach because I&amp;#39;m looking at</text>
  <text start="863.829" dur="5.341">all this and I&amp;#39;m seeing it I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="866.8" dur="4.62">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s nothing else they can do</text>
  <text start="869.17" dur="6.27">at this point except cover it up of</text>
  <text start="871.42" dur="6.09">course now I&amp;#39;m not predicting anything</text>

  <text start="892.089" dur="8.25">one of these sectors is trending down</text>
  <text start="895.23" dur="7.719">it&amp;#39;s not improving it hasn&amp;#39;t improved or</text>
  <text start="900.339" dur="6.24">they&amp;#39;re bouncing around because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="902.949" dur="4.861">manipulating all the information and we</text>
  <text start="906.579" dur="3.391">know what happens to manipulation</text>
  <text start="907.81" dur="5.25">eventually they can&amp;#39;t manipulate anymore</text>
  <text start="909.97" dur="6.51">and everything just falls apart so at</text>
  <text start="913.06" dur="5.519">this point we all need to be ready</text>
  <text start="916.48" dur="6.539">because we see what&amp;#39;s happening across</text>
