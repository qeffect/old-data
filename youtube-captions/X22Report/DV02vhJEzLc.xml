  <text start="251.669" dur="4.35">stores closing people losing their jobs</text>
  <text start="254.549" dur="3.24">well they try to manipulate that by</text>
  <text start="256.019" dur="4.321">getting rid of that department that</text>
  <text start="257.789" dur="5.791">counts layoffs back in 2013 they got rid</text>
  <text start="260.34" dur="5.28">of it because of budget cuts but we know</text>
  <text start="263.58" dur="3.839">why they got rid of it because it shows</text>
  <text start="265.62" dur="3.299">that there&amp;#39;s massive layoffs but we do</text>
  <text start="267.419" dur="3.331">have private companies like challenger</text>
  <text start="268.919" dur="5.49">gray &amp;amp; christmas which reports on</text>

  <text start="317.23" dur="4.47">throughout the year remember the stock</text>
  <text start="319.03" dur="4.35">market is completely manipulated it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="321.7" dur="3.96">not based on the revenue of the</text>
  <text start="323.38" dur="5.07">corporations it&amp;#39;s not based on what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.66" dur="5.7">really going on in the country it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="328.45" dur="6.03">based on the central bankers blowing up</text>
  <text start="331.36" dur="6.87">the market bubble period the end that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="334.48" dur="6.75">it they need that to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="338.23" dur="4.14">that everything is doing fine now real</text>
  <text start="341.23" dur="3.18">estate is a little bit harder to</text>
  <text start="342.37" dur="4.95">manipulate but they are able to do it as</text>
  <text start="344.41" dur="4.77">the Fed creates free money they passes</text>
  <text start="347.32" dur="4.59">free money on to the hedge funds the</text>
  <text start="349.18" dur="5.91">investment companies they were told to</text>
  <text start="351.91" dur="4.8">purchase homes and hold on to them they</text>
  <text start="355.09" dur="3.81">don&amp;#39;t purchase one or two they purchase</text>
  <text start="356.71" dur="3.87">thousands of them rent them out if you</text>
  <text start="358.9" dur="3.57">can but do not let them out on the</text>
  <text start="360.58" dur="3.42">market because if they don&amp;#39;t let him out</text>
  <text start="362.47" dur="5.28">on the market guess what the prices go</text>
  <text start="364" dur="8.1">up they also told banks if you have a</text>
  <text start="367.75" dur="5.82">foreclosure try not to foreclose let the</text>
  <text start="372.1" dur="2.73">people live there and I know many many</text>
  <text start="373.57" dur="3.06">people that are living in their homes</text>
  <text start="374.83" dur="3.66">who haven&amp;#39;t paid their mortgages</text>
  <text start="376.63" dur="4.14">whatsoever and the bank is letting them</text>
  <text start="378.49" dur="3.99">live there because the banks are</text>
  <text start="380.77" dur="3.42">figuring well I commit to be taking care</text>
  <text start="382.48" dur="4.08">of their house they could be mowing the</text>
  <text start="384.19" dur="4.92">lawn and we don&amp;#39;t have to worry about</text>
  <text start="386.56" dur="4.17">the home right now and the Fed is giving</text>
  <text start="389.11" dur="3.09">us free money so they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="390.73" dur="3.21">buying up this toxic real estate so</text>
  <text start="392.2" dur="3.21">what&amp;#39;s the big deal anyhow they keep</text>
  <text start="393.94" dur="6.74">those houses off the market guess what</text>
  <text start="395.41" dur="8.01">the prices go up now to bring in us</text>
  <text start="400.68" dur="6.94">everyday people into the real estate</text>
  <text start="403.42" dur="7.11">market what do they need to do well they</text>
  <text start="407.62" dur="5.91">need to allow subprime they need to</text>
  <text start="410.53" dur="5.7">bring down the requirements of the loans</text>
  <text start="413.53" dur="4.2">that they need to get just like they did</text>
  <text start="416.23" dur="3.45">back in two thousand eight and this is</text>
  <text start="417.73" dur="6.05">exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing now but we</text>
  <text start="419.68" dur="7.17">know most of the people in the US are</text>
  <text start="423.78" dur="5.32">not really buying the homes the home</text>
  <text start="426.85" dur="5.46">purchases are coming from foreign</text>
  <text start="429.1" dur="4.56">investors like China as the Wanda values</text>
  <text start="432.31" dur="3.24">guess what they need a place to park</text>
  <text start="433.66" dur="5.04">their money so they park it in real</text>
  <text start="435.55" dur="4.67">estate in the United States we know the</text>
  <text start="438.7" dur="6.42">hedge funds are purchasing the homes</text>
  <text start="440.22" dur="7.99">this is why Morgan a JPMorgan Chase Bank</text>
  <text start="445.12" dur="5.31">of America Wells Fargo City Bank they</text>
  <text start="448.21" dur="4.23">have been laying off tens of thousands</text>
  <text start="450.43" dur="5.94">of people in their mortgage department</text>
  <text start="452.44" dur="6.51">since august of 2013 and its continuing</text>
  <text start="456.37" dur="4.71">so FHA decided you know what let&amp;#39;s try</text>
  <text start="458.95" dur="3.99">to bring in even more people to the real</text>
  <text start="461.08" dur="3.96">estate market so we&amp;#39;re going to ask them</text>
  <text start="462.94" dur="4.32">to put three percent down actually some</text>
  <text start="465.04" dur="5.18">bakes are saying absolutely zero percent</text>
  <text start="467.26" dur="8.1">down and we&amp;#39;ll pay for the closing costs</text>
  <text start="470.22" dur="8.05">but this wasn&amp;#39;t enough still people worn</text>
  <text start="475.36" dur="6.54">out their purchasing homes why because</text>
  <text start="478.27" dur="6.44">they don&amp;#39;t have jobs but don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="481.9" dur="5.34">they came up with a different solution</text>
  <text start="484.71" dur="7.08">now they&amp;#39;re going to offer lower</text>
  <text start="487.24" dur="8.07">mortgage insurance premiums so in</text>
  <text start="491.79" dur="5.5">January of 2015 they reduce the mortgage</text>
  <text start="495.31" dur="6.15">insurance premiums for FHA loans and</text>
  <text start="497.29" dur="6.87">they&amp;#39;re continually doing this and the</text>
  <text start="501.46" dur="6.3">lowered as they lower the cost of these</text>
  <text start="504.16" dur="6.33">home loans they brought in 75,000 new</text>
  <text start="507.76" dur="5.73">bars with credit scores less than 680</text>
  <text start="510.49" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re doing it again this way they can</text>
  <text start="513.49" dur="7.8">bring in people that have credit scores</text>
  <text start="516.49" dur="7.26">lower than 580 and we are starting to</text>
  <text start="521.29" dur="6.48">see that they&amp;#39;re becoming very very</text>
  <text start="523.75" dur="6.24">desperate now the savings from the on</text>
  <text start="527.77" dur="5.16">the borrower&amp;#39;s is around nine hundred</text>
  <text start="529.99" dur="5.16">dollars per year now I don&amp;#39;t know about</text>
  <text start="532.93" dur="6.27">you but if someone has a problem with</text>
  <text start="535.15" dur="5.7">nine hundred dollars a year maybe they</text>
  <text start="539.2" dur="3.93">shouldn&amp;#39;t be purchasing the house right</text>
  <text start="540.85" dur="4.35">now and a lot of these people most</text>
  <text start="543.13" dur="3.66">likely probably shouldn&amp;#39;t be purchasing</text>
  <text start="545.2" dur="5.4">the house because we saw what happened</text>
  <text start="546.79" dur="5.16">back in 2007-2008 when everything</text>
  <text start="550.6" dur="3.09">started to fall apart people just left</text>
  <text start="551.95" dur="6.06">their homes and the whole thing came</text>
  <text start="553.69" dur="9.21">tumbling down but they need to keep us</text>
  <text start="558.01" dur="8.249">in this illusionary world of real estate</text>
  <text start="562.9" dur="6.239">still doing well case-shiller is</text>
  <text start="566.259" dur="5.25">oh my god home prices that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="569.139" dur="6.45">rising incredibly but when we really</text>
  <text start="571.509" dur="5.64">look at this the house prices have</text>
  <text start="575.589" dur="4.65">flattened and they&amp;#39;re actually dropping</text>
  <text start="577.149" dur="5.43">they use a lot of seasonal adjustments</text>
  <text start="580.239" dur="4.26">to make it look like there&amp;#39;s a gain in</text>
  <text start="582.579" dur="5.7">house prices now I&amp;#39;m looking around the</text>
  <text start="584.499" dur="7.02">country and guess what in a lot of the</text>
  <text start="588.279" dur="5.85">cities and a lot of the suburbs these</text>
  <text start="591.519" dur="5.55">house prices have come down quite a bit</text>
  <text start="594.129" dur="6.091">and people are having a very very very</text>
  <text start="597.069" dur="5.341">tough time selling these homes so when</text>
  <text start="600.22" dur="5.599">we look at it we see that case-shiller</text>
  <text start="602.41" dur="7.589">home price rose by a very little bit</text>
  <text start="605.819" dur="7.75">about point one percent if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="609.999" dur="6">manipulate all the numbers and basically</text>
  <text start="613.569" dur="4.2">this is the seventh consecutive miss in</text>
  <text start="615.999" dur="2.911">a row where they fill out the house</text>
  <text start="617.769" dur="3.201">prices we&amp;#39;re going to go much much</text>
  <text start="618.91" dur="5.489">higher now they only look at a certain</text>
  <text start="620.97" dur="6.88">group of cities and they&amp;#39;re reporting</text>
  <text start="624.399" dur="7.11">about two to three months back and we</text>
  <text start="627.85" dur="5.789">can see right now that the real estate</text>
  <text start="631.509" dur="3.63">market the prices and now this is not</text>
  <text start="633.639" dur="4.47">going to hit everywhere at once but it</text>
  <text start="635.139" dur="5.13">does move quite quickly once it starts</text>
  <text start="638.109" dur="4.53">to take off it&amp;#39;s been moving very slow</text>
  <text start="640.269" dur="4.86">and eventually what we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="642.639" dur="5.73">is what we saw back in 2007-2008 where</text>
  <text start="645.129" dur="4.89">all of a sudden housing prices drop</text>
  <text start="648.369" dur="5.01">dramatically and it spreads across the</text>
  <text start="650.019" dur="5.55">United States and it will hit every area</text>
  <text start="653.379" dur="3.96">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see it spread</text>
  <text start="655.569" dur="3.33">right now and we&amp;#39;re starting to see it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="657.339" dur="7.2">getting tougher and tougher and tougher</text>
  <text start="658.899" dur="7.8">to purchase a house now of course the US</text>
  <text start="664.539" dur="4.8">government central banker saintly we</text>
  <text start="666.699" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t eat manufacturing for this economy</text>
  <text start="669.339" dur="3.54">we&amp;#39;re going to depend on the service</text>
  <text start="671.139" dur="3.66">sector now yesterday we discussed that</text>
  <text start="672.879" dur="4.29">the service sector cannot push this</text>
  <text start="674.799" dur="4.08">economy along and they&amp;#39;re saying the</text>
  <text start="677.169" dur="3.301">service sector it&amp;#39;s not even connected</text>
