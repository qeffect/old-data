  <text start="38.02" dur="5.55">September first 2016 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="40.87" dur="4.41">the episode is did Obama create an</text>
  <text start="43.57" dur="5.19">executive order for the collapsing</text>
  <text start="45.28" dur="6.11">economy let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="48.76" dur="5.22">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="51.39" dur="5.32">now in the past week or two we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="53.98" dur="4.68">talking about George Soros and how these</text>
  <text start="56.71" dur="4.59">leaked documents were out there about</text>
  <text start="58.66" dur="5.49">his open society foundation and we</text>
  <text start="61.3" dur="6.179">realized that he was behind and still is</text>
  <text start="64.15" dur="6.57">behind the refugee crisis in Europe with</text>
  <text start="67.479" dur="6.601">Obama at the UN we also realized that</text>
  <text start="70.72" dur="6.06">he&amp;#39;s behind black lives matter these</text>
  <text start="74.08" dur="5.64">documents also show us that he wants to</text>
  <text start="76.78" dur="8.129">regulate the internet and control free</text>
  <text start="79.72" dur="8.46">speech and very interestingly is that</text>
  <text start="84.909" dur="6.991">delete documents also show that he was</text>
  <text start="88.18" dur="7.92">using black lives matter that movement</text>
  <text start="91.9" dur="8.67">to ultimately federalize the America&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="96.1" dur="6.81">police forces now the document is called</text>
  <text start="100.57" dur="4.23">police reform how to take advantage of</text>
  <text start="102.91" dur="3.84">the crisis of the moment and drive</text>
  <text start="104.8" dur="5.43">long-term institutional change and</text>
  <text start="106.75" dur="6.87">police community practice the document</text>
  <text start="110.23" dur="6.18">states that the Foundation&amp;#39;s us programs</text>
  <text start="113.62" dur="5.13">was seeking to use this moment meaning</text>
  <text start="116.41" dur="4.62">the so-called crisis and policing</text>
  <text start="118.75" dur="5.01">following high-profile shootings and</text>
  <text start="121.03" dur="7.53">charges of racism to create a national</text>
  <text start="123.76" dur="9.44">movement for police reform now what they</text>
  <text start="128.56" dur="8.819">want to do is they want to take away the</text>
  <text start="133.2" dur="6.94">local police they want to give them</text>
  <text start="137.379" dur="5.22">grants they want to federalize them and</text>
  <text start="140.14" dur="6.39">have them centrally controlled by the</text>
  <text start="142.599" dur="5.551">government and we can see there are more</text>
  <text start="146.53" dur="3.87">than 30 police departments across the</text>
  <text start="148.15" dur="5.07">nation that have fold that have fallen</text>
  <text start="150.4" dur="6.18">under the federal oversight following</text>
  <text start="153.22" dur="6.829">some of these incidences and what they</text>
  <text start="156.58" dur="6.58">like to do is get the entire country</text>
  <text start="160.049" dur="6.171">controlled by the federal government</text>
  <text start="163.16" dur="4.62">now they do use blackmail where they say</text>
  <text start="166.22" dur="3.45">listen you need to do what we say or</text>
  <text start="167.78" dur="5.31">you&amp;#39;re not going to get your federal</text>
  <text start="169.67" dur="5.91">funds they also do this with education</text>
  <text start="173.09" dur="5.16">but we can see all of these things that</text>
  <text start="175.58" dur="5.19">are being ginned up here they are part</text>
  <text start="178.25" dur="3.81">of an agenda now you have to say to</text>
  <text start="180.77" dur="3.63">yourself why would they want to</text>
  <text start="182.06" dur="4.5">federalize the police forces why would</text>
  <text start="184.4" dur="4.37">they want to control the police forces</text>
  <text start="186.56" dur="5.76">all the way down to the local level and</text>
  <text start="188.77" dur="6.94">we&amp;#39;ll think about it when the system</text>
  <text start="192.32" dur="7.77">implodes which it&amp;#39;s not if but when when</text>
  <text start="195.71" dur="9">it implodes and everything comes to a</text>
  <text start="200.09" dur="9.33">screeching halt they need control of the</text>
  <text start="204.71" dur="6.54">situation the federalized police forces</text>
  <text start="209.42" dur="7.83">will be taking orders from the</text>
  <text start="211.25" dur="7.77">government to control the situation so</text>
  <text start="217.25" dur="4.32">they don&amp;#39;t need to put troops on the</text>
  <text start="219.02" dur="5.85">ground they don&amp;#39;t need to do a lot of</text>
  <text start="221.57" dur="5.97">this because they already have police</text>
  <text start="224.87" dur="6.12">forces already in position to take</text>
  <text start="227.54" dur="5.88">orders and to do what the government</text>
  <text start="230.99" dur="6.75">wants and most of them won&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="233.42" dur="6.48">question it they will just do it and we</text>
  <text start="237.74" dur="4.29">can see this is where they are headed</text>
  <text start="239.9" dur="4.47">because we can see around the world a</text>
  <text start="242.03" dur="3.96">lot of the government&amp;#39;s in many of these</text>
  <text start="244.37" dur="3.81">countries they&amp;#39;re preparing for this</text>
  <text start="245.99" dur="3.75">economic collapse because we know</text>
  <text start="248.18" dur="4.17">there&amp;#39;s going to be riots we know that</text>
  <text start="249.74" dur="3.66">deliveries are going to freeze up people</text>
  <text start="252.35" dur="3.359">are going to be able to get their money</text>
  <text start="253.4" dur="4.019">people are going to understand what is</text>
  <text start="255.709" dur="4.321">happening because we were just in this</text>
  <text start="257.419" dur="4.621">middle of this recovery and everything</text>
  <text start="260.03" dur="6.62">was supposed to be fine where did this</text>
  <text start="262.04" dur="10.47">come from so we can see this is the</text>
  <text start="266.65" dur="9.21">agenda for all of this to control the</text>
  <text start="272.51" dur="7.68">situation now we see from other</text>
  <text start="275.86" dur="7.809">documents that there is a secretive</text>
  <text start="280.19" dur="6.36">warfare occurring in Latin America us</text>
  <text start="283.669" dur="5.25">special operation forces are training in</text>
  <text start="286.55" dur="8.01">Latin America and they have tripled</text>
  <text start="288.919" dur="8.071">between 2007 and 2014 now this document</text>
  <text start="294.56" dur="6.02">was obtained by the Human Rights</text>
  <text start="296.99" dur="6.96">advocacy organization and they are</text>
  <text start="300.58" dur="6.37">realizing that over the past eight years</text>
  <text start="303.95" dur="5.91">nearly 4,000 US Special Forces have</text>
  <text start="306.95" dur="7.98">trained 13,000 Latin American security</text>
  <text start="309.86" dur="12.23">forces at a cost of 73 million now the</text>
  <text start="314.93" dur="12.33">question is is what is this all about</text>
  <text start="322.09" dur="7.57">what is the mission who exactly is the</text>
  <text start="327.26" dur="6.27">u.s. training are they implicated in</text>
  <text start="329.66" dur="6.71">human rights abuses is it now the US</text>
  <text start="333.53" dur="6.06">military crafting US foreign policy and</text>
  <text start="336.37" dur="7.36">where is the public oversight to all of</text>
  <text start="339.59" dur="9.06">this it&amp;#39;s completely non-existent but we</text>
  <text start="343.73" dur="7.08">can see down in South America the reason</text>
  <text start="348.65" dur="4.98">why they might be doing this look what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="350.81" dur="4.32">happening in Venezuela pressure from the</text>
  <text start="353.63" dur="4.97">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="355.13" dur="6.09">to squeeze them until they give and</text>
  <text start="358.6" dur="6.85">hopefully have regime change there look</text>
  <text start="361.22" dur="6.6">what&amp;#39;s happening in Brazil and we can</text>
  <text start="365.45" dur="4.41">see they might have been training all of</text>
  <text start="367.82" dur="5.31">these individuals for these purposes</text>
  <text start="369.86" dur="8.97">they&amp;#39;ve done it in other countries Yemen</text>
  <text start="373.13" dur="8.34">Libya Lebanon Iraq Ukraine and many</text>
  <text start="378.83" dur="5.28">others and that&amp;#39;s a situation we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="381.47" dur="4.95">going to have to watch here we see the</text>
  <text start="384.11" dur="4.53">sole American manufacturer of cluster</text>
  <text start="386.42" dur="4.38">bombs well they stopped producing them</text>
  <text start="388.64" dur="3.75">because they were there was a lot of</text>
  <text start="390.8" dur="4.32">pressure from international rights</text>
  <text start="392.39" dur="5.04">groups which have said that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="395.12" dur="4.29">made munitions were used by Saudi</text>
  <text start="397.43" dur="4.35">military during air strikes in Yemen and</text>
  <text start="399.41" dur="6.03">killed a lot of women a lot of children</text>
  <text start="401.78" dur="6.24">and the company that was making them it</text>
  <text start="405.44" dur="5.01">is called textron systems it&amp;#39;s a Rhode</text>
  <text start="408.02" dur="4.2">Island based company and they decided to</text>
  <text start="410.45" dur="3.63">stop the manufacturing and you have to</text>
  <text start="412.22" dur="4.02">remember something very important the</text>
  <text start="414.08" dur="4.74">United States has neither signed or</text>
  <text start="416.24" dur="6.69">ratified the 2008 Convention on cluster</text>
  <text start="418.82" dur="6.9">munitions so they&amp;#39;re not part of this</text>
  <text start="422.93" dur="5.9">ban they never went ahead and ratified</text>
  <text start="425.72" dur="5.16">it or signed it and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="428.83" dur="5.53">they were using the</text>
  <text start="430.88" dur="6.72">these weapons to put pressure on the</text>
  <text start="434.36" dur="6.24">people inside of Yemen saying listen you</text>
  <text start="437.6" dur="4.89">will do what we say you will install the</text>
  <text start="440.6" dur="6.09">puppet government allow them back into</text>
  <text start="442.49" dur="7.44">the country or we&amp;#39;re going to make you</text>
  <text start="446.69" dur="5.76">suffer this is exactly what was going on</text>
  <text start="449.93" dur="5.07">in Yemen but the who teased the people</text>
  <text start="452.45" dur="6.45">they are fighting back because when you</text>
  <text start="455" dur="6.23">push individuals into a corner end and</text>
  <text start="458.9" dur="5.55">they have nothing else to lose and</text>
  <text start="461.23" dur="8.05">they&amp;#39;re fighting for a cause for their</text>
  <text start="464.45" dur="6.78">country for their fellow citizens they</text>
  <text start="469.28" dur="5.58">will continually fight until the very</text>
  <text start="471.23" dur="6.75">very end and they will not give up Saudi</text>
  <text start="474.86" dur="5.7">Arabia the u.s. they really don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="477.98" dur="5.88">anything in this except for oil control</text>
  <text start="480.56" dur="7.62">of this country the central bank the</text>
  <text start="483.86" dur="6.12">petro dollar and this is why the US is</text>
  <text start="488.18" dur="4.86">having a problem in all of these</text>
  <text start="489.98" dur="7.53">countries because the people are rising</text>
  <text start="493.04" dur="7.11">up and it&amp;#39;s getting harder and harder to</text>
  <text start="497.51" dur="5.72">control this situation now out and</text>
  <text start="500.15" dur="7.26">Ukraine we see that the situation is</text>
  <text start="503.23" dur="6.31">deteriorating right now and of course</text>
  <text start="507.41" dur="3.66">the corporate media the US government</text>
  <text start="509.54" dur="2.97">they&amp;#39;re trying to make it seem like</text>
  <text start="511.07" dur="3.33">nothing&amp;#39;s going on there because they</text>
  <text start="512.51" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t report anything that that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="514.4" dur="5.73">on out in Ukraine but we can see right</text>
  <text start="517.01" dur="5.82">now the US Treasury they have expanded</text>
  <text start="520.13" dur="8.43">their sanctions on Russia for its</text>
  <text start="522.83" dur="9.38">activities in Ukraine and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="528.56" dur="6.72">expanding their sanctions because their</text>
  <text start="532.21" dur="7.27">terrorist attack in Crimea they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="535.28" dur="8.24">shelling in the southeastern area of Don</text>
  <text start="539.48" dur="6.45">bass of Ukraine is not going as planned</text>
  <text start="543.52" dur="5.64">right now the Ukrainian troops they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="545.93" dur="7.02">received a thousand night vision devices</text>
  <text start="549.16" dur="7.06">from the US and we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="552.95" dur="7.85">u.s. is out there and this is a very odd</text>
  <text start="556.22" dur="7.76">thing to say they&amp;#39;ve unveiled a plan</text>
  <text start="560.8" dur="7.83">where if Russia in</text>
  <text start="563.98" dur="9.87">age Ukraine the US says the US and</text>
  <text start="568.63" dur="7.74">Ukraine are ready with this plan they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="573.85" dur="6.18">discussed this with the Germans with the</text>
  <text start="576.37" dur="5.82">French the polls the British and if the</text>
  <text start="580.03" dur="6.95">worst happens and a full-scale invasion</text>
  <text start="582.19" dur="10.05">of Ukraine occurs a plan is ready which</text>
  <text start="586.98" dur="11.71">tells us that the US and Ukraine they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="592.24" dur="10.56">preparing to initiate this fight they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="598.69" dur="7.68">prepared to push this forward with some</text>
  <text start="602.8" dur="6.96">type of false flag hoping that Russia</text>
  <text start="606.37" dur="9.09">will come in and start fighting in</text>
  <text start="609.76" dur="10.1">Ukraine and their plan is war that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="615.46" dur="8.64">their plan we see right now that obama</text>
  <text start="619.86" dur="8.8">he is extending the Libyan war for</text>
  <text start="624.1" dur="8.88">another 30 days all US warships will</text>
  <text start="628.66" dur="6.18">stay in the area the USS Carney well</text>
  <text start="632.98" dur="5.1">that is close enough to be seen from the</text>
  <text start="634.84" dur="4.86">shore and we can see right now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="638.08" dur="3.62">been talking about the United States</text>
  <text start="639.7" dur="4.5">going into Libya for quite a while and</text>
  <text start="641.7" dur="4.72">we knew from all the indicators from the</text>
  <text start="644.2" dur="5.01">French doing reconnaissance from having</text>
  <text start="646.42" dur="6.33">special op teams inside of Libya we can</text>
  <text start="649.21" dur="6.51">see right now they try to put in a unity</text>
  <text start="652.75" dur="4.62">government the unity government really</text>
  <text start="655.72" dur="3.75">can&amp;#39;t do anything in there because the</text>
  <text start="657.37" dur="5.52">parliament rejected them twice already</text>
  <text start="659.47" dur="6.84">and it really should be dissolved but we</text>
  <text start="662.89" dur="7.95">can see right now the u.s. is prepared</text>
  <text start="666.31" dur="7.8">to keep this going until they control</text>
  <text start="670.84" dur="5.88">the country once again and as we look at</text>
  <text start="674.11" dur="4.65">the entire situation we see that the</text>
  <text start="676.72" dur="6.15">United States government and the central</text>
  <text start="678.76" dur="7.41">bankers they cannot control the</text>
  <text start="682.87" dur="7.2">situation in the Middle East and their</text>
  <text start="686.17" dur="6.87">biggest fear is that the people will</text>
  <text start="690.07" dur="5.31">take over the country remove the puppet</text>
  <text start="693.04" dur="4.06">governments get rid of the private</text>
  <text start="695.38" dur="5.83">western central bank and</text>
  <text start="697.1" dur="6.09">stop dealing in the dollar they will no</text>
  <text start="701.21" dur="4.29">longer sell the oil using the dollar</text>
  <text start="703.19" dur="4.2">this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to prevent</text>
  <text start="705.5" dur="6.24">right now because once this happens the</text>
  <text start="707.39" dur="6.78">system implodes automatically no ifs</text>
  <text start="711.74" dur="4.94">ands or buts it just collapses so</text>
  <text start="714.17" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;re holding this off long enough as</text>
  <text start="716.68" dur="5.11">we can see out in Ukraine to get a war</text>
  <text start="719.57" dur="5.16">started as we can see out in the Pacific</text>
  <text start="721.79" dur="7.62">to get a war started as we can see out</text>
  <text start="724.73" dur="7.2">in Syria to get a war started and what</text>
  <text start="729.41" dur="7.86">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is this major</text>
  <text start="731.93" dur="9.33">push now something very interesting with</text>
  <text start="737.27" dur="5.7">this whole voting system where you know</text>
  <text start="741.26" dur="4.65">they were talking about how the voting</text>
  <text start="742.97" dur="5.43">system was hacked it&amp;#39;s coming from North</text>
  <text start="745.91" dur="6.03">Korea it&amp;#39;s Russia and they keep changing</text>
  <text start="748.4" dur="5.34">in a round of who&amp;#39;s doing what but they</text>
  <text start="751.94" dur="4.11">just want people to know that it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="753.74" dur="10.11">foreign entity that is hacking our</text>
  <text start="756.05" dur="11.76">system now prior to this hack DHS came</text>
  <text start="763.85" dur="7.53">up with a plan to centralize and to</text>
  <text start="767.81" dur="9.15">control the voting system and then all</text>
  <text start="771.38" dur="9.39">of a sudden a couple weeks after there</text>
  <text start="776.96" dur="7.53">was a hack now remember they only do</text>
  <text start="780.77" dur="7.1">things to push their agenda along so</text>
  <text start="784.49" dur="8.91">they needed this hack to push DHS plan</text>
  <text start="787.87" dur="8.97">forward and it&amp;#39;s very convenient how the</text>
  <text start="793.4" dur="6.6">the timing and how this occurred because</text>
  <text start="796.84" dur="5.62">we realize that DHS also came out and</text>
  <text start="800" dur="5.4">said listen we will also we will also</text>
  <text start="802.46" dur="6.21">monitor the voting systems while the</text>
  <text start="805.4" dur="7.17">elections going on to detect malware to</text>
  <text start="808.67" dur="5.16">detect anyone inside of the system so</text>
  <text start="812.57" dur="2.94">they&amp;#39;ve had these plans from the</text>
  <text start="813.83" dur="3.81">beginning they want to centralize</text>
  <text start="815.51" dur="4.17">central banks like to centralize things</text>
  <text start="817.64" dur="6.72">which means they like to control</text>
  <text start="819.68" dur="7.62">everything from the top and why would</text>
  <text start="824.36" dur="5.67">they want to control this well they can</text>
  <text start="827.3" dur="3.69">control the outcome of the election it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="830.03" dur="4.17">much easier to</text>
  <text start="830.99" dur="6.27">troll the entire situation and do push</text>
  <text start="834.2" dur="5.79">us even further I see in the corporate</text>
  <text start="837.26" dur="5.22">media they&amp;#39;re still playing up syke of</text>
  <text start="839.99" dur="6.5">course but they&amp;#39;re starting to come out</text>
  <text start="842.48" dur="7.08">with a new term called Zika zones and</text>
  <text start="846.49" dur="5.74">they&amp;#39;re running polls now where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="849.56" dur="6.96">saying Americans are afraid to go into</text>
  <text start="852.23" dur="6.479">the Zika zones and they started going</text>
  <text start="856.52" dur="3.93">into saying well you know the Zika zones</text>
  <text start="858.709" dur="3.721">are in certain states like Florida New</text>
  <text start="860.45" dur="5.06">York and many others that are being</text>
  <text start="862.43" dur="7.14">infected right now through the Gulf and</text>
  <text start="865.51" dur="5.92">this might interfere with elections</text>
  <text start="869.57" dur="5.459">because if we have people that are</text>
  <text start="871.43" dur="9.18">afraid to go into these zones well the</text>
  <text start="875.029" dur="8.581">elections might have to be postponed so</text>
  <text start="880.61" dur="8.46">we already see that propaganda out there</text>
  <text start="883.61" dur="8.61">we also see the propaganda for a cyber</text>
  <text start="889.07" dur="8.63">attack on the voting system now let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="892.22" dur="10.65">take all of that and think about Obama</text>
  <text start="897.7" dur="8.17">well we can see right now that the</text>
  <text start="902.87" dur="5.07">corporate media was playing up hey maybe</text>
  <text start="905.87" dur="5.76">Obama would be in there for a third term</text>
  <text start="907.94" dur="5.94">and of course Obama said no no I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="911.63" dur="4.079">want to have a third term usually when</text>
  <text start="913.88" dur="4.079">people do this type of thing where they</text>
  <text start="915.709" dur="3.901">say no I really wouldn&amp;#39;t want to do it I</text>
  <text start="917.959" dur="5.011">don&amp;#39;t want to but if I was asked of</text>
  <text start="919.61" dur="4.86">course I would continue and out of</text>
  <text start="922.97" dur="3.63">nowhere and this is coming from Rob</text>
  <text start="924.47" dur="5.04">Kirby who heard it from Jim Willie and</text>
  <text start="926.6" dur="5.34">rom Kirby was being interviewed by</text>
  <text start="929.51" dur="5.49">Elijah Johnson on Finance and liberty</text>
  <text start="931.94" dur="5.76">and something very interesting at the</text>
  <text start="935" dur="5.61">end of Obama&amp;#39;s term he created this new</text>
  <text start="937.7" dur="5.4">executive order and the executive order</text>
  <text start="940.61" dur="6.66">is on the order of succession in the</text>
  <text start="943.1" dur="7.95">Treasury Department okay let&amp;#39;s read what</text>
  <text start="947.27" dur="5.49">this says it says section one subject to</text>
  <text start="951.05" dur="4.05">the provisions of section 3 of the</text>
  <text start="952.76" dur="5.25">executive order the officers named in</text>
  <text start="955.1" dur="5.76">Section two in the order listed shall</text>
  <text start="958.01" dur="4.769">act as a as and perform the functions</text>
  <text start="960.86" dur="3.88">and duties of the office of secretary of</text>
  <text start="962.779" dur="4.391">the Treasury during any</text>
  <text start="964.74" dur="4.409">period when both the secretary and the</text>
  <text start="967.17" dur="6.12">deputy secretary of the Treasury have</text>
  <text start="969.149" dur="6.421">died resigned or otherwise unable to</text>
  <text start="973.29" dur="5.43">perform the functions and duties of the</text>
  <text start="975.57" dur="6.3">office of the secretary now the question</text>
  <text start="978.72" dur="7.679">we have to ask is why would Obama do</text>
  <text start="981.87" dur="7.95">this at this point in time he&amp;#39;s at his</text>
  <text start="986.399" dur="7.681">last term here a new president will be</text>
  <text start="989.82" dur="6.51">coming in we know during the fall is</text>
  <text start="994.08" dur="3.569">going to be elections and then come</text>
  <text start="996.33" dur="4.53">January there&amp;#39;s going to be a new</text>
  <text start="997.649" dur="6.661">president why didn&amp;#39;t they wait for the</text>
  <text start="1000.86" dur="6.539">new president and this has to do with</text>
  <text start="1004.31" dur="7.38">the Treasury Department the order of</text>
  <text start="1007.399" dur="9.421">succession so let&amp;#39;s think about this for</text>
  <text start="1011.69" dur="7.5">a second if the economy collapses this</text>
  <text start="1016.82" dur="4.889">fall and I&amp;#39;m just looking at the</text>
  <text start="1019.19" dur="4.889">indicators I&amp;#39;m not saying it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1021.709" dur="8.461">but a lot of the indicators are pointing</text>
  <text start="1024.079" dur="9.75">towards this point in time any postpones</text>
  <text start="1030.17" dur="5.24">the election or lets the elections go</text>
  <text start="1033.829" dur="4.35">through doesn&amp;#39;t make a difference</text>
  <text start="1035.41" dur="7.06">because he&amp;#39;s still president until</text>
  <text start="1038.179" dur="8.25">January and everything falls apart let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1042.47" dur="7.98">say there was some type of blast where</text>
  <text start="1046.429" dur="7.531">the Treasury Department was hit where</text>
  <text start="1050.45" dur="10.14">they can say ah because of this physical</text>
  <text start="1053.96" dur="11.099">attack the economy is suffering this</text>
  <text start="1060.59" dur="8.7">executive order to me stands out as here</text>
  <text start="1065.059" dur="7.651">we go this is for the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="1069.29" dur="6.75">and we&amp;#39;re going to use this executive</text>
  <text start="1072.71" dur="8.06">order because we know something is going</text>
  <text start="1076.04" dur="8.16">to happen in the Treasury Department now</text>
  <text start="1080.77" dur="8.62">maybe the system dies and collapses and</text>
  <text start="1084.2" dur="6.78">the head of treasury resins and maybe</text>
  <text start="1089.39" dur="4.77">something happens to the next person in</text>
  <text start="1090.98" dur="4.3">line and this is why they have this</text>
  <text start="1094.16" dur="3.16">because</text>
  <text start="1095.28" dur="4.14">the entire system is collapsing and</text>
  <text start="1097.32" dur="5.43">people are just running for the hills or</text>
  <text start="1099.42" dur="5.04">there was a physical attack in the</text>
  <text start="1102.75" dur="5.58">Treasury and these individuals who are</text>
  <text start="1104.46" dur="6.3">together got hit which then they can say</text>
  <text start="1108.33" dur="4.35">since they got hit we need to close the</text>
  <text start="1110.76" dur="5.57">banking system we need to close down</text>
  <text start="1112.68" dur="7.47">certain things the economy is suffering</text>
  <text start="1116.33" dur="8.38">so when we look at this it tells us that</text>
  <text start="1120.15" dur="8.13">something is going to happen during this</text>
  <text start="1124.71" dur="6.03">period or maybe they are planning for</text>
  <text start="1128.28" dur="5.82">something and they&amp;#39;re making sure that</text>
  <text start="1130.74" dur="5.88">everything is lined up for this time</text>
  <text start="1134.1" dur="4.25">period now remember these individuals</text>
  <text start="1136.62" dur="4.23">they come up with a lot of plans</text>
  <text start="1138.35" dur="7.99">something work out some of them don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1140.85" dur="7.59">but they always keep their goals and to</text>
  <text start="1146.34" dur="7.14">me if they get the green light we can</text>
  <text start="1148.44" dur="8.58">see something actually happening so when</text>
  <text start="1153.48" dur="8.99">we see this especially now he did this</text>

  <text start="1165.78" dur="8.16">coming up something is off right now and</text>
  <text start="1170.81" dur="7.12">when we look closely at this this is</text>
  <text start="1173.94" dur="7.62">another indicator telling us that</text>
  <text start="1177.93" dur="6.75">something could be happening during this</text>
  <text start="1181.56" dur="5.16">time period because we have DHS who</text>
  <text start="1184.68" dur="4.53">wants to control the elections</text>
  <text start="1186.72" dur="6.03">centralize the elections we have Zika</text>

  <text start="1207.09" dur="8.7">is declining and collapsing very quickly</text>
  <text start="1210" dur="10.65">and we can see all of this is happening</text>
