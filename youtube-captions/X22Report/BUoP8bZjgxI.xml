  <text start="684.4" dur="4.29">have done with their foundation this is</text>
  <text start="686.44" dur="4.71">why Trump has been calling this out</text>
  <text start="688.69" dur="4.71">letting everyone know this is why he</text>
  <text start="691.15" dur="3.34">continually mentions it never even</text>
  <text start="693.4" dur="3.85">looked at the</text>

  <text start="1454.76" dur="4.11">address by your favorite president me</text>
  <text start="1456.77" dur="5.52">now it looks like Trump is getting his</text>
  <text start="1458.87" dur="5.88">wish in early June reports surfaced that</text>

  <text start="1492.53" dur="3.69">expected to make an appearance</text>
  <text start="1493.97" dur="4.14">and Trump who has used a heavy hand in</text>
  <text start="1496.22" dur="4.34">planning the parade even reportedly</text>
  <text start="1498.11" dur="6.03">floated the idea of a surprise f-35</text>
  <text start="1500.56" dur="9.34">flyover now this is very interesting</text>
  <text start="1504.14" dur="7.34">because q kind of let us know that this</text>
  <text start="1509.9" dur="5.37">was going to happen</text>
  <text start="1511.48" dur="6.01">now it&amp;#39;s unclear how much this is going</text>

  <text start="1529.22" dur="5.31">twice as long as previous shows so I</text>
  <text start="1532.46" dur="5.73">think a lot of different corporations</text>
  <text start="1534.53" dur="7.35">are donating all of this and I think</text>
  <text start="1538.19" dur="5.25">this is not going to cost as much as the</text>
  <text start="1541.88" dur="3.24">hundred million dollar price tag I think</text>
  <text start="1543.44" dur="3.36">it&amp;#39;s gonna be much much lower because I</text>
  <text start="1545.12" dur="5.58">think there&amp;#39;s a lot of donations coming</text>
  <text start="1546.8" dur="9.75">in but I want to go back to post 29 87</text>
  <text start="1550.7" dur="7.94">and this was March 2019 and this was</text>

  <text start="1673.67" dur="5.52">where we go one we go all and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1677.33" dur="5.12">very interesting about Trump having this</text>
  <text start="1679.19" dur="7.38">at the Lincoln Memorial remember Obama</text>
  <text start="1682.45" dur="7.09">he looked up to Abraham Lincoln not in</text>
  <text start="1686.57" dur="5.94">the way we think he used Abraham Lincoln</text>
  <text start="1689.54" dur="5.39">and it&amp;#39;s strange that Trump is having</text>
  <text start="1692.51" dur="6.36">this at the Lincoln Memorial Plus</text>
  <text start="1694.93" dur="5.11">Lincoln he issued the greenback because</text>
  <text start="1698.87" dur="4.35">he didn&amp;#39;t want to borrow the money from</text>
  <text start="1700.04" dur="7.2">the central banks and he was</text>
  <text start="1703.22" dur="6.12">assassinated and the greenbacks they</text>
  <text start="1707.24" dur="4.2">were removed from the economy and the</text>

  <text start="1711.44" dur="7.71">in and I find it not coincidental but I</text>
  <text start="1716.6" dur="6.8">think this was planned on Trump&amp;#39;s part</text>
  <text start="1719.15" dur="5.57">to have it here on July 4th Independence</text>
