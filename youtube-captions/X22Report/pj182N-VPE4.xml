  <text start="102.88" dur="5.489">financial news now at this point we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="105.729" dur="6.331">been watching the economy breaking it</text>
  <text start="108.369" dur="5.551">down showing that the economic numbers</text>
  <text start="112.06" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re throwing at us they really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="113.92" dur="5.67">make any sense whatsoever and we know</text>
  <text start="116.47" dur="5.1">that manufacturing cannot all come back</text>
  <text start="119.59" dur="3.33">to United States within a year it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="121.57" dur="4.5">not going to work companies right now</text>
  <text start="122.92" dur="5.49">they have no incentive to come back to</text>
  <text start="126.07" dur="4.29">the United States because of all the</text>
  <text start="128.41" dur="4.32">laws and regulations have been put into</text>
  <text start="130.36" dur="4.35">place and it took many many years to</text>
  <text start="132.73" dur="5.16">push these countries out of the country</text>
  <text start="134.71" dur="5.34">and we see right now that Trump the</text>
  <text start="137.89" dur="4.1">Patriots what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is</text>
  <text start="140.05" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re setting everything up and</text>
  <text start="141.99" dur="6.39">basically planning out everything for</text>
  <text start="145.96" dur="5.73">when the central banking system</text>
  <text start="148.38" dur="5.77">collapses and we need to remember that</text>
  <text start="151.69" dur="4.71">both sides are going to try to control</text>
  <text start="154.15" dur="5.07">the narrative of how this collapse</text>
  <text start="156.4" dur="6.09">proceeds and Trump has already started</text>
  <text start="159.22" dur="4.8">the trade wars with other countries I</text>
  <text start="162.49" dur="3.66">mean of course the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="164.02" dur="4.62">calling a trade wars but once again what</text>
  <text start="166.15" dur="5.64">we&amp;#39;re seeing here is the destruction of</text>
  <text start="168.64" dur="5.61">the globalist model and right now Trump</text>
  <text start="171.79" dur="4.5">is telling the crowds that he&amp;#39;s speaking</text>
  <text start="174.25" dur="3.39">in front of that we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="176.29" dur="4.08">things happen over the coming months</text>
  <text start="177.64" dur="6.12">that are going to really shock you with</text>
  <text start="180.37" dur="5.51">trade now he said you will see things</text>
  <text start="183.76" dur="4.46">happen over the coming months that</text>
  <text start="185.88" dur="4.74">going to really shock you because for so</text>
  <text start="188.22" dur="4.29">many years we felt so badly our jobs</text>
  <text start="190.62" dur="4.05">have been taken our companies have been</text>
  <text start="192.51" dur="5.63">taken like we are a bunch of babies</text>
  <text start="194.67" dur="6.03">those days are gone they&amp;#39;re gone and</text>
  <text start="198.14" dur="4.27">basically what he&amp;#39;s saying is that the</text>
  <text start="200.7" dur="4.14">central banking system the deep state</text>
  <text start="202.41" dur="4.2">system the globalist system all of this</text>
  <text start="204.84" dur="3.69">is going to be destroyed and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="206.61" dur="4.41">going to happen here is everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="208.53" dur="5.7">going to be reworked and jobs eventually</text>
  <text start="211.02" dur="5.13">will come back to the United States but</text>
  <text start="214.23" dur="4.74">once again if you have the central</text>
  <text start="216.15" dur="4.83">banking system in place this will not</text>
  <text start="218.97" dur="3.63">happen because all the central bankers</text>
  <text start="220.98" dur="3.66">are going to do the globalist and</text>
  <text start="222.6" dur="4.86">everyone else they&amp;#39;re just going to</text>
  <text start="224.64" dur="4.56">restart the system now remember both</text>
  <text start="227.46" dur="3.18">sides are going to try to control the</text>
  <text start="229.2" dur="3.75">narrative and what we see coming out of</text>
  <text start="230.64" dur="4.53">the bank of some central bank of all</text>
  <text start="232.95" dur="3.68">central bank&amp;#39;s Lieb is the Bank for</text>
  <text start="235.17" dur="4.14">International Settlements</text>
  <text start="236.63" dur="4.93">we see something very interesting coming</text>
  <text start="239.31" dur="5.49">out of there and this shows you that</text>
  <text start="241.56" dur="4.62">they are preparing a way to control this</text>
  <text start="244.8" dur="4.07">narrative and they&amp;#39;re getting ready to</text>
  <text start="246.18" dur="5.94">point the fingers someplace else and</text>
  <text start="248.87" dur="5.68">coming out of their latest annual</text>
  <text start="252.12" dur="4.35">economic report the Bank of</text>
  <text start="254.55" dur="6.39">International Settlements has confirmed</text>
  <text start="256.47" dur="7.68">that banks may indeed they might be</text>
  <text start="260.94" dur="7.98">disguising their borrowings in a way</text>
  <text start="264.15" dur="9.06">very similar to the way Lehman did right</text>
  <text start="268.92" dur="7.59">before they imploded now this is very</text>
  <text start="273.21" dur="4.71">interesting because from everything that</text>
  <text start="276.51" dur="4.08">we&amp;#39;ve been hearing is that these banks</text>
  <text start="277.92" dur="4.8">are fantastic they&amp;#39;ve passed all the</text>
  <text start="280.59" dur="3.81">stress tests everything was great and we</text>
  <text start="282.72" dur="4.35">have this central bank of all central</text>
  <text start="284.4" dur="4.62">banks saying us not know the banks have</text>
  <text start="287.07" dur="4.05">been manipulating their books that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="289.02" dur="4.02">pretty much what they&amp;#39;re saying here now</text>
  <text start="291.12" dur="4.26">remember the central bank of central</text>
  <text start="293.04" dur="5.07">banks they don&amp;#39;t care if the low-lying</text>
  <text start="295.38" dur="5.43">central banks disappear because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="298.11" dur="5.31">gonna be still in existence there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="300.81" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re putting out the warning and they</text>
  <text start="303.42" dur="4.47">are the main central bank and what</text>
  <text start="305.73" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;ll just do if they can control the</text>
  <text start="307.89" dur="3.69">system is they will start and put</text>
  <text start="309.84" dur="3.72">central bank&amp;#39;s back into the countries</text>
  <text start="311.58" dur="3.63">again and just say don&amp;#39;t worry we got</text>
  <text start="313.56" dur="2.94">rid of the other ones here are the new</text>
  <text start="315.21" dur="3.36">ones to replace them with all new</text>
  <text start="316.5" dur="2.97">leadership and everything like that so</text>
  <text start="318.57" dur="3.18">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="319.47" dur="4.08">now is there trying to figure out a way</text>
  <text start="321.75" dur="5.49">and they&amp;#39;re doing it right now</text>
  <text start="323.55" dur="7.29">to control the narrative now for those</text>
  <text start="327.24" dur="5.64">unfamiliar the bids explains that the</text>
  <text start="330.84" dur="4.41">window dressing refers to the practice</text>
  <text start="332.88" dur="5.37">of adjusting balance sheets around</text>
  <text start="335.25" dur="5.4">regular reporting dates such as year or</text>
  <text start="338.25" dur="4.02">quarter ends and notes that window</text>
  <text start="340.65" dur="4.26">dressing can reflect attempts to</text>
  <text start="342.27" dur="6.66">optimize a firm&amp;#39;s profit and loss for</text>
  <text start="344.91" dur="6.84">taxation purposes so when we look at</text>
  <text start="348.93" dur="6.06">this we can see that what the banks are</text>
  <text start="351.75" dur="7.08">doing is they&amp;#39;re using the repo market</text>
  <text start="354.99" dur="7.23">but why repo because as a form of</text>
  <text start="358.83" dur="5.13">collateral borrowing repos allow banks</text>
  <text start="362.22" dur="4.11">to obtain short-term funding against</text>
  <text start="363.96" dur="5.49">some of their assets a balance sheet</text>
  <text start="366.33" dur="7.95">expanding operation the cash received</text>
  <text start="369.45" dur="7.38">can then be moved into reverse repos and</text>
  <text start="374.28" dur="5.4">the corresponding collateral may be used</text>
  <text start="376.83" dur="4.56">for further borrowing at quarter ends</text>
  <text start="379.68" dur="3.03">banks can reverse the increase in their</text>
  <text start="381.39" dur="4.38">balance sheet by closing part of the</text>
  <text start="382.71" dur="6.36">reverse repo contracts and using the</text>
  <text start="385.77" dur="5.79">cash obtained to repay repos this</text>
  <text start="389.07" dur="5.73">compression raises their reported</text>
  <text start="391.56" dur="5.7">leverage ratio massaging their assets</text>
  <text start="394.8" dur="4.14">lower and boosting leverage ratios</text>
  <text start="397.26" dur="3">allowing the banks to report them as</text>
  <text start="398.94" dur="4.41">being in line with regulatory</text>
  <text start="400.26" dur="7.05">requirements so what did the biz finally</text>
  <text start="403.35" dur="6.35">find well to help banks appear healthier</text>
  <text start="407.31" dur="5.01">than they are for regulatory purposes</text>
  <text start="409.7" dur="5.26">central banks are essentially diluting</text>
  <text start="412.32" dur="5.4">the impact of their own monetary policy</text>
  <text start="414.96" dur="5.01">and this is not a new development we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="417.72" dur="4.41">seen this before the use of repo</text>
  <text start="419.97" dur="5.4">borrowing is similar to a Lehman style</text>
  <text start="422.13" dur="5.7">trick in which the doom bank used repos</text>
  <text start="425.37" dur="4.2">to disguise its borrowing before it</text>
  <text start="427.83" dur="4.17">imploded in 2008 in the biggest-ever</text>
  <text start="429.57" dur="6.69">u.s. bankruptcy so right now what the</text>
  <text start="432" dur="7.68">biz is telling us is that banks might be</text>
  <text start="436.26" dur="6.8">doing this and we&amp;#39;re just out there to</text>
  <text start="439.68" dur="5.52">let you know that we figured it out gee</text>
  <text start="443.06" dur="4.81">you think they didn&amp;#39;t know this all</text>
  <text start="445.2" dur="6.21">along and I&amp;#39;ve said this in in past</text>
  <text start="447.87" dur="5.07">reports we&amp;#39;re gonna see so many things</text>
  <text start="451.41" dur="3.36">come out</text>
  <text start="452.94" dur="4.38">the system crashes you never see it</text>
  <text start="454.77" dur="4.41">before the system crashes you only see</text>
  <text start="457.32" dur="4.02">it after the system crashes just like</text>
  <text start="459.18" dur="5.4">the subprime securities like as I keep</text>
  <text start="461.34" dur="4.98">mentioning they all the way up to the</text>
  <text start="464.58" dur="4.32">crash they were all triple-a when the</text>
  <text start="466.32" dur="4.35">crash hit then everyone said hey by the</text>
  <text start="468.9" dur="4.08">way I don&amp;#39;t know if anyone realized this</text>
  <text start="470.67" dur="4.35">but they weren&amp;#39;t really triple-a the</text>
  <text start="472.98" dur="4.86">central bank right now is projecting</text>
  <text start="475.02" dur="4.83">ahead letting you know that this is</text>
  <text start="477.84" dur="4.17">going to be the reason why these banks</text>
  <text start="479.85" dur="4.8">fail they&amp;#39;re letting you know they</text>
  <text start="482.01" dur="5.07">already figured it out and they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="484.65" dur="4.71">good guys but they&amp;#39;re not they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="487.08" dur="5.01">this because they&amp;#39;re getting ready to</text>
  <text start="489.36" dur="5.67">control the narrative and this is what</text>
  <text start="492.09" dur="5.58">the central banks do they create the</text>
  <text start="495.03" dur="4.35">situations and then they say hey you</text>
  <text start="497.67" dur="3.12">know what we just figured it out we know</text>
  <text start="499.38" dur="3.93">what these banks are doing we know what</text>
  <text start="500.79" dur="5.58">these subprime securities are we know</text>
  <text start="503.31" dur="4.98">this we know that and all along they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="506.37" dur="4.8">the ones who created it they always knew</text>
  <text start="508.29" dur="4.86">it and now they&amp;#39;re turning around so</text>
  <text start="511.17" dur="4.41">basically they&amp;#39;re projecting I went to</text>
  <text start="513.15" dur="3.78">the future what is going to happen and</text>
  <text start="515.58" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re letting everyone know this and</text>
  <text start="516.93" dur="5.039">it it makes them feel less guilty when</text>
  <text start="519.9" dur="4.98">everything starts to implode so what</text>
  <text start="521.969" dur="6.601">we&amp;#39;re seeing at this point is the bank</text>
  <text start="524.88" dur="6.45">of all central banks they are getting</text>
  <text start="528.57" dur="3.99">prepared and ready to control this</text>
  <text start="531.33" dur="3.12">narrative and they&amp;#39;re already putting</text>
  <text start="532.56" dur="3.3">more information out there to let you</text>
  <text start="534.45" dur="3.87">know that these banks are going to fail</text>
  <text start="535.86" dur="4.8">just like Lehman we already knew this</text>
  <text start="538.32" dur="4.77">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about this for a very</text>
  <text start="540.66" dur="6.63">long time we already know the European</text>
  <text start="543.09" dur="6.42">banks well they&amp;#39;re insolvent the US</text>
  <text start="547.29" dur="4.23">banks and the stress test the stress</text>
  <text start="549.51" dur="4.11">test was only put there to convince</text>
  <text start="551.52" dur="3.96">everyone that these banks were strong</text>
  <text start="553.62" dur="3.57">and all they did was manipulate their</text>
  <text start="555.48" dur="5.13">books just like the central banks were</text>
  <text start="557.19" dur="5.37">saying the the biz this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="560.61" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re saying we&amp;#39;ve already known this</text>
  <text start="562.56" dur="5.88">and we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on this for</text>
  <text start="564.81" dur="6.029">many years we&amp;#39;re at the point now where</text>
  <text start="568.44" dur="4.08">the whole system is going to be coming</text>
  <text start="570.839" dur="4.741">down and they&amp;#39;re gonna be out there on</text>
  <text start="572.52" dur="5.73">the front lines telling you that we told</text>
  <text start="575.58" dur="5.96">you this was going to happen and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="578.25" dur="5.25">the bank&amp;#39;s fault or the feds fault or</text>
  <text start="581.54" dur="3.91">whoever they&amp;#39;re going to blame but</text>
  <text start="583.5" dur="3.28">they&amp;#39;re going to look like they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="585.45" dur="3.13">ones who knew</text>
  <text start="586.78" dur="4.29">they already told you it was going to</text>
  <text start="588.58" dur="4.05">happen and they&amp;#39;re the good guys but</text>
  <text start="591.07" dur="3.42">really what&amp;#39;s happening right now is</text>
  <text start="592.63" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re getting prepared and ready to</text>
  <text start="594.49" dur="3.99">control the narrative so they can move</text>
  <text start="596.38" dur="3.9">us into a completely different system on</text>
  <text start="598.48" dur="4.08">the other hand we have the Patriots like</text>
  <text start="600.28" dur="5.34">I&amp;#39;ve always said they are getting ready</text>
  <text start="602.56" dur="4.65">to basically counter everything the</text>
  <text start="605.62" dur="3.48">central bank is doing and I&amp;#39;m sure they</text>
  <text start="607.21" dur="4.35">have a lot evidence and and other</text>
  <text start="609.1" dur="4.65">information to show that they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="611.56" dur="4.92">ones who caused all this but that will</text>
  <text start="613.75" dur="5.91">come out very soon but we can see right</text>
  <text start="616.48" dur="5.04">now things are breaking down rapidly and</text>
  <text start="619.66" dur="4.68">the central banks are now positioning</text>
  <text start="621.52" dur="5.67">themselves to basically control this</text>
  <text start="624.34" dur="4.59">entire narrative so get prepared get</text>
  <text start="627.19" dur="3.51">ready because this system is coming down</text>
