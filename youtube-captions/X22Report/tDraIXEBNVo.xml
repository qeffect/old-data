  <text start="69.33" dur="3.75">looking at the economic indicators for a</text>
  <text start="71.67" dur="4.14">very long time looking at a lot of</text>
  <text start="73.08" dur="5.55">statistics calling out the US government</text>
  <text start="75.81" dur="5.94">essential bankers on how they calculate</text>
  <text start="78.63" dur="5.94">these statistics and most of the time we</text>

  <text start="107.85" dur="3.659">in the dark of what&amp;#39;s really happening</text>
  <text start="109.649" dur="3.871">because if they started to show 10</text>
  <text start="111.509" dur="5.191">cities they started to show people</text>

  <text start="138.12" dur="7.26">this footage of sprawling tent cities</text>
  <text start="141.51" dur="8.18">that is home to an estimated 1,000</text>
  <text start="145.38" dur="7.62">residents now this is just one area and</text>
  <text start="149.69" dur="6.4">you know that there&amp;#39;s many more of these</text>
  <text start="153" dur="7.08">10 these type of 10 cities around the</text>
  <text start="156.09" dur="7.05">country now he&amp;#39;s saying that at one time</text>

  <text start="165.12" dur="5.46">transformed into a tent city rife with</text>
  <text start="167.73" dur="6.229">crime that reeks of garbage and human</text>
  <text start="170.58" dur="6.87">feces and what&amp;#39;s happening here is that</text>

  <text start="191.75" dur="5.34">to leak out and people are starting to</text>
  <text start="194.18" dur="5.37">see what&amp;#39;s really going on instead of</text>

  <text start="265.01" dur="7.409">is what happens over time when people</text>
  <text start="269.57" dur="4.77">lose their jobs nobody sees what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="272.419" dur="4.921">happening they lose their homes they</text>

  <text start="280.789" dur="6.661">others who&amp;#39;ve lost their homes their</text>
  <text start="284.36" dur="6.179">cars but the corporate media will never</text>
  <text start="287.45" dur="6.06">ever report on this this is what they</text>
  <text start="290.539" dur="6.301">keep hidden so you believe in this</text>
  <text start="293.51" dur="8.51">illusion of a recovery that the economy</text>
  <text start="296.84" dur="8.82">is fine now the Department of Commerce</text>
  <text start="302.02" dur="7.42">announced that January trade deficit</text>
  <text start="305.66" dur="6.84">surged in January of 2017 jumping from</text>
  <text start="309.44" dur="8.67">40 4.3 billion in December</text>

  <text start="318.11" dur="7.92">the biggest trade deficit in five years</text>
  <text start="321.47" dur="6.75">going back to 2012 this is not a good</text>
  <text start="326.03" dur="6.42">sign whatsoever we see the Atlanta Fed</text>
  <text start="328.22" dur="9.84">right now well they revived their first</text>
  <text start="332.45" dur="9.51">quarter GDP lower now it was started</text>
  <text start="338.06" dur="6.51">started out at 2.7% then it went down to</text>
  <text start="341.96" dur="7.11">one point eight percent now we&amp;#39;re down</text>
  <text start="344.57" dur="7.349">to one point three percent and as we can</text>
  <text start="349.07" dur="5.7">see this point this is the manipulated</text>
  <text start="351.919" dur="4.981">number the real number if we go to</text>
  <text start="354.77" dur="7.62">shadow steps we&amp;#39;re in the negative</text>
  <text start="356.9" dur="9.53">territory now the OECD they have issued</text>
  <text start="362.39" dur="6.77">a gloomy outlook on global growth and</text>
  <text start="366.43" dur="5.77">what they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s because of</text>
  <text start="369.16" dur="6.19">protectionism and failing trust in</text>
  <text start="372.2" dur="6.12">national governments now we do see this</text>
  <text start="375.35" dur="4.92">around the world where people are rising</text>
  <text start="378.32" dur="4.86">up they&amp;#39;re saying we don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="380.27" dur="5.94">type of government and the OECD is</text>
  <text start="383.18" dur="4.26">saying that yes this is why things are</text>
  <text start="386.21" dur="6.78">starting to fall apart now they were</text>
  <text start="387.44" dur="7.8">falling apart way before that actually</text>
  <text start="392.99" dur="4.32">if you look out in Europe you look here</text>
  <text start="395.24" dur="3.39">in the United States and you go past the</text>
  <text start="397.31" dur="4.32">manipulated numbers which we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="398.63" dur="5.46">reporting on day after day we can see</text>
  <text start="401.63" dur="4.41">what&amp;#39;s really been going on and if you</text>
  <text start="404.09" dur="5.579">notice Europe they lower their</text>
  <text start="406.04" dur="6.45">unemployment number just in time to say</text>
  <text start="409.669" dur="4.951">oh look it was getting better now we</text>
  <text start="412.49" dur="3.87">have this outlook that things are</text>
  <text start="414.62" dur="3.48">starting to fall apart because we can</text>
  <text start="416.36" dur="3.48">see in France we can see in Germany we</text>
  <text start="418.1" dur="3.78">can see in Italy the people are just</text>
  <text start="419.84" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re not cooperating and countries</text>
  <text start="421.88" dur="5.25">want to leave the EU so at this point</text>
  <text start="424.7" dur="6.24">things are going to start to really get</text>
  <text start="427.13" dur="6.78">bad for the people no because the</text>
  <text start="430.94" dur="5.49">economies around the world they were</text>
  <text start="433.91" dur="6.6">awful and they were getting worse as</text>

  <text start="440.51" dur="5.659">debt people had no jobs they were</text>
  <text start="443" dur="5.21">austerity all over the place now</text>
  <text start="446.169" dur="6.78">what we need to do is we need to watch</text>
  <text start="448.21" dur="7.769">out for these catalysts that might</text>
  <text start="452.949" dur="6.72">trigger everything and we can see right</text>

  <text start="534.43" dur="4.17">a domino effect and it&amp;#39;s going to ripple</text>

  <text start="573.519" dur="3.8">syndrome signal and</text>
  <text start="577.47" dur="10.14">this tells us that people should be</text>
  <text start="582.43" dur="10.53">selling off now we can just take this</text>
  <text start="587.61" dur="7.71">specific indicator latch it to the other</text>
  <text start="592.96" dur="6.21">indicators that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="595.32" dur="5.71">where we see the global credit impulse</text>
  <text start="599.17" dur="3.51">below zero and the negative territory</text>
  <text start="601.03" dur="3.93">showing us that the credit markets going</text>

  <text start="616.81" dur="5.28">second half of this year things are</text>
  <text start="619.3" dur="5.85">going to rapidly fall apart and this is</text>
  <text start="622.09" dur="7.82">just another indicator showing that</text>
  <text start="625.15" dur="7.53">people should start to sell off and</text>
  <text start="629.91" dur="4.45">we&amp;#39;re starting to see that a lot of</text>
  <text start="632.68" dur="5.73">these indicators are pointing to the</text>
  <text start="634.36" dur="5.85">same period of time and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="638.41" dur="5.52">looking at the economy for quite a while</text>
  <text start="640.21" dur="6.09">and the reason that we&amp;#39;re documenting</text>
  <text start="643.93" dur="6.84">all of this because we need to</text>
  <text start="646.3" dur="8.58">understand what the central bank&amp;#39;s do to</text>
  <text start="650.77" dur="7.11">keep the economy afloat to keep the</text>
  <text start="654.88" dur="6.48">illusion alive and what indicators to</text>
  <text start="657.88" dur="7.02">look at throughout this time period to</text>
  <text start="661.36" dur="7.62">warn us what is coming now the economy</text>
  <text start="664.9" dur="6.57">just doesn&amp;#39;t collapse overnight it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="668.98" dur="4.59">just one time it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s perfectly fine</text>
  <text start="671.47" dur="3.93">the next minute everything just falls</text>
  <text start="673.57" dur="3.9">apart that&amp;#39;s not how it works it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="675.4" dur="3.81">happen like that in 2008 either everyone</text>
  <text start="677.47" dur="3.45">thinks it does because they remember</text>
  <text start="679.21" dur="3.6">October they remember when the stock</text>
  <text start="680.92" dur="3.6">market came down and they said wow it</text>
  <text start="682.81" dur="4.68">was doing fine and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="684.52" dur="4.11">boom everything just fell apart and the</text>
  <text start="687.49" dur="4.26">corporate media they didn&amp;#39;t even how to</text>
  <text start="688.63" dur="5.7">explain it at that time and then videos</text>
  <text start="691.75" dur="4.29">and people doing research came out with</text>
  <text start="694.33" dur="3.99">oh this is what happened with the</text>
  <text start="696.04" dur="5.79">subprime securities this was going on</text>
  <text start="698.32" dur="5.27">for quite a while I mean the</text>
  <text start="701.83" dur="6.3">deregulation of glass-steagall</text>
  <text start="703.59" dur="6.47">contributed to a lot of this but look at</text>
  <text start="708.13" dur="5.2">the time</text>
  <text start="710.06" dur="6.15">n and this is what we&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="713.33" dur="5.43">we can see how everything has been</text>
  <text start="716.21" dur="5.91">created and how the illusion has been</text>
  <text start="718.76" dur="5.73">pumped up with unemployment or how they</text>
  <text start="722.12" dur="4.35">have manipulated all their numbers with</text>
  <text start="724.49" dur="5.73">GDP how they had to manipulate those</text>
  <text start="726.47" dur="5.43">numbers with the housing market how they</text>
  <text start="730.22" dur="3.93">had to manipulate it where the Fed</text>
  <text start="731.9" dur="5.73">stepped in bought up all the toxic real</text>
  <text start="734.15" dur="6.03">estate told the bank&amp;#39;s not to foreclose</text>
  <text start="737.63" dur="6.06">on homes keep him on the market the Fed</text>
  <text start="740.18" dur="5.1">said the Fed gave money to the banks</text>
  <text start="743.69" dur="5.55">they put it into the stock market pump</text>
  <text start="745.28" dur="6.87">that up I mean think about what they had</text>
  <text start="749.24" dur="6.84">to do to keep the illusion alive how</text>
  <text start="752.15" dur="6.42">much currency they had to create how</text>
  <text start="756.08" dur="4.71">they had a monetized almost everything</text>
  <text start="758.57" dur="6.08">how they had to bring the interest rates</text>
  <text start="760.79" dur="7.41">down to zero and in many areas negative</text>
  <text start="764.65" dur="5.86">look what they had to do to keep this</text>
  <text start="768.2" dur="5.04">system afloat go back to two thousand</text>
