  <text start="180.15" dur="6.12">happened and we see right now that Saudi</text>
  <text start="183.81" dur="6.03">Arabia is continually doing this now the</text>
  <text start="186.27" dur="7.2">behind-the-scenes to all of this Trump</text>
  <text start="189.84" dur="7.92">made this agreement with Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="193.47" dur="6.36">for a specific reason and it&amp;#39;s not for</text>
  <text start="197.76" dur="6.03">those individuals to keep jobs that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="199.83" dur="6.15">just in a benefit to the deal but there</text>
  <text start="203.79" dur="3.87">was a reason why he went to Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="205.98" dur="3.75">there&amp;#39;s a reason why he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="207.66" dur="4.92">Israel there&amp;#39;s a reason why he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="209.73" dur="5.46">to Brussels and to the Vatican because</text>
  <text start="212.58" dur="5.01">behind the scenes behind all of this</text>
  <text start="215.19" dur="4.62">that is happening right now he is going</text>
  <text start="217.59" dur="4.92">to stop the wars in all these countries</text>
  <text start="219.81" dur="4.74">now everyone&amp;#39;s going you are off your</text>
  <text start="222.51" dur="4.44">rocker you are crazy</text>
  <text start="224.55" dur="6">no that&amp;#39;s not why he&amp;#39;s going here it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="226.95" dur="4.68">to create more war that&amp;#39;s what he wants</text>
  <text start="230.55" dur="3.51">you to think</text>
  <text start="231.63" dur="4.38">just like with North Korea he wants</text>
  <text start="234.06" dur="4.29">everyone to think that he&amp;#39;s going to war</text>
  <text start="236.01" dur="4.8">now remember who wants the war the deeps</text>
  <text start="238.35" dur="3.96">a true never said let&amp;#39;s continue with</text>
  <text start="240.81" dur="3.63">the wars let&amp;#39;s make sure they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="242.31" dur="4.92">cross our red lines he doesn&amp;#39;t speak in</text>
  <text start="244.44" dur="4.59">absolutes he&amp;#39;s doing things behind the</text>
  <text start="247.23" dur="4.8">scenes and he needs to do it very</text>
  <text start="249.03" dur="5.64">carefully in the way he does it he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="252.03" dur="5.13">telling these countries right now that</text>
  <text start="254.67" dur="5.069">things are about to come to an end now</text>
  <text start="257.16" dur="3.93">Tillerson was out there and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="259.739" dur="4.261">that the foreign trip is meant to</text>
  <text start="261.09" dur="6.51">confront threat of terrorism what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="264" dur="6.54">saying it is time to basically confront</text>
  <text start="267.6" dur="5.79">those individuals that created the</text>
  <text start="270.54" dur="4.35">terrorists in all of these countries now</text>
  <text start="273.39" dur="3.81">people of course are going to say no</text>
  <text start="274.89" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s not what he&amp;#39;s saying they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="277.2" dur="5.43">telling you right now he is going after</text>
  <text start="280.08" dur="5.52">the terrorists when I say the terrorists</text>
  <text start="282.63" dur="5.67">I&amp;#39;m not talking about Iran he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="285.6" dur="5.04">going after Syria he&amp;#39;s going after the</text>
  <text start="288.3" dur="5.31">paid mercenaries the paid mercenaries</text>
  <text start="290.64" dur="5.64">are the terrorist groups that had been</text>
  <text start="293.61" dur="5.13">created by the neocons by the central</text>
  <text start="296.28" dur="4.77">banks by the deep state now the</text>
  <text start="298.74" dur="4.17">president was giving a speech in Saudi</text>
  <text start="301.05" dur="5.31">Arabia saying he&amp;#39;s going to fight</text>
  <text start="302.91" dur="6.99">Islamist extremism and he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="306.36" dur="6.84">push this agenda and he made a promise</text>
  <text start="309.9" dur="6.54">that America will not seek to impose our</text>
  <text start="313.2" dur="4.98">way of life on others which the deep</text>
  <text start="316.44" dur="3.72">State has been doing and I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="318.18" dur="5.58">explain all this on how he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="320.16" dur="5.85">is behind the scenes so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="323.76" dur="5.31">seeing right now is that he&amp;#39;s out there</text>
  <text start="326.01" dur="5.01">and he&amp;#39;s doing things behind him just</text>
  <text start="329.07" dur="4.62">like North Korea where he continually</text>
  <text start="331.02" dur="4.74">says if the right conditions are met I</text>
  <text start="333.69" dur="5.37">will meet with North Korea North Korea</text>
  <text start="335.76" dur="6.63">is saying listen you know something if</text>
  <text start="339.06" dur="5.16">you stop the hostile provocations</text>
  <text start="342.39" dur="3.69">against our country we will speak to you</text>
  <text start="344.22" dur="3.3">so Trump is looking at this and saying</text>
  <text start="346.08" dur="3.51">maybe these are the right conditions</text>
  <text start="347.52" dur="5.73">maybe this is then we can speak to them</text>
  <text start="349.59" dur="6.15">if you notice he wants to speak to all</text>
  <text start="353.25" dur="4.29">these countries but it&amp;#39;s difficult to do</text>
  <text start="355.74" dur="4.77">when the corporate media and the deep</text>
  <text start="357.54" dur="5.85">state is pushing for war he has to build</text>
  <text start="360.51" dur="7.16">this up to make it look like it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="363.39" dur="7.17">other country who wants to speak to him</text>
  <text start="367.67" dur="4.96">because he can&amp;#39;t come out and do this</text>
  <text start="370.56" dur="5.7">because the deep state would be all over</text>
  <text start="372.63" dur="6.15">them and if they see this happening well</text>
  <text start="376.26" dur="4.74">they would start something it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="378.78" dur="3.02">tricky thing that he needs to do at this</text>
  <text start="381" dur="6.9">point</text>
  <text start="381.8" dur="9.64">now Tillerson is also saying that they</text>
  <text start="387.9" dur="6.24">might speak to Iran he says I&amp;#39;d never</text>
  <text start="391.44" dur="4.35">shut off the phone to anyone that wants</text>
  <text start="394.14" dur="7.46">to talk or have a productive</text>
  <text start="395.79" dur="10.44">conversation that he is open to a new</text>
  <text start="401.6" dur="6.4">dialogue with the Iranians so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="406.23" dur="5.06">open to a dialogue with North Korea</text>
  <text start="408" dur="6.419">they&amp;#39;re open to a dialogue with Iran and</text>
  <text start="411.29" dur="7.6">they&amp;#39;re going after the paid mercenaries</text>
  <text start="414.419" dur="7.681">in all of these countries this is their</text>
  <text start="418.89" dur="5.61">goal right now and we can see that North</text>
  <text start="422.1" dur="4.8">Korea while they fired another missile</text>
  <text start="424.5" dur="4.29">it landed in international waters and</text>
  <text start="426.9" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;ve been firing off missiles going</text>
  <text start="428.79" dur="6.95">all the way back I mean past 2006 up to</text>
  <text start="432.39" dur="7.38">the present day and they never stopped</text>
  <text start="435.74" dur="6.58">pushing their missile testing because</text>
  <text start="439.77" dur="4.5">they realized eventually what the deep</text>
  <text start="442.32" dur="4.11">state is going to do is they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="444.27" dur="4.74">invade North Korea and have regime</text>
  <text start="446.43" dur="6.06">change this has been their plan for</text>
  <text start="449.01" dur="5.01">quite a while now out in Iraq we see</text>
  <text start="452.49" dur="3.12">that the Iraqi special force</text>
  <text start="454.02" dur="4.079">they declared their mission complete in</text>
  <text start="455.61" dur="4.739">muscle right now and they said that they</text>
  <text start="458.099" dur="5.761">will fight again if called on to do so</text>
  <text start="460.349" dur="6.6">we also see that there&amp;#39;s a new region</text>
  <text start="463.86" dur="5.91">force that was deployed at the outcome</text>
  <text start="466.949" dur="5.641">border now remember the deep state wants</text>
  <text start="469.77" dur="4.47">to protect this area right now they want</text>
  <text start="472.59" dur="4.859">the border because this is how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="474.24" dur="5.7">bringing troops into Syria this is where</text>
  <text start="477.449" dur="4.741">they train their paid mercenaries this</text>
  <text start="479.94" dur="4.319">is where they basically give them</text>
  <text start="482.19" dur="5.28">supplies they need they fund them and</text>
  <text start="484.259" dur="5.851">everything else we see that Russia we</text>
  <text start="487.47" dur="4.62">see that Syria they are trying to</text>
  <text start="490.11" dur="5.13">capture this area because it would cut</text>
  <text start="492.09" dur="6.419">them off completely now Russia they</text>
  <text start="495.24" dur="6">might deploy special operation forces to</text>
  <text start="498.509" dur="5.22">this area in the southeastern part of</text>
  <text start="501.24" dur="4.229">Syria now they do have these special</text>
  <text start="503.729" dur="4.171">forces that are working in the central</text>
  <text start="505.469" dur="3.361">and western areas of northern Syria and</text>
  <text start="507.9" dur="2.91">it looks like they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="508.83" dur="4.709">bringing these forces down to this area</text>
  <text start="510.81" dur="5.789">and you can see there&amp;#39;s a big buildup of</text>
  <text start="513.539" dur="5.401">troops of Russian and Syrian troops on</text>
  <text start="516.599" dur="3.93">the border because they understand that</text>
  <text start="518.94" dur="5.01">the deep state they&amp;#39;re going to make a</text>
  <text start="520.529" dur="5.161">move to get into Syria because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="523.95" dur="3.84">still trying to reach their goal they</text>
  <text start="525.69" dur="5.57">still want Assad out they still want a</text>
  <text start="527.79" dur="7.2">war they haven&amp;#39;t stopped doing this now</text>
  <text start="531.26" dur="7.18">behind the scenes right now what we are</text>
  <text start="534.99" dur="6.48">seeing is that Russia and the United</text>
  <text start="538.44" dur="6.87">States they&amp;#39;re going to be working with</text>
  <text start="541.47" dur="7.92">each other to get rid of the paid</text>
  <text start="545.31" dur="7.98">mercenaries a proposal is in the works</text>
  <text start="549.39" dur="7.92">right now to deconflict operations in</text>
  <text start="553.29" dur="6.18">Syria with Russia US forces are legally</text>
  <text start="557.31" dur="3.75">precluded from coordinating with the</text>
  <text start="559.47" dur="3.059">Russians this is coming from General</text>
  <text start="561.06" dur="4.14">Joseph Dunford chairman of the Joint</text>
  <text start="562.529" dur="4.411">Chiefs of Staff but the US and Russian</text>
  <text start="565.2" dur="3.69">militaries have been maintaining</text>
  <text start="566.94" dur="3.99">multiple communication channels to</text>
  <text start="568.89" dur="5.13">deconflict operations in Syria we have a</text>
  <text start="570.93" dur="6.719">proposal that were working on with the</text>
  <text start="574.02" dur="6.03">Russians right now but the details of</text>
  <text start="577.649" dur="5.75">the cooperation and what they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="580.05" dur="7.839">on right now well he cannot offer them</text>
  <text start="583.399" dur="7.88">now the Russians are very enthusiastic</text>
  <text start="587.889" dur="7.17">about this new plan now think about when</text>
  <text start="591.279" dur="7.53">Trump had lavrov and kiss lyac meet him</text>
  <text start="595.059" dur="5.97">in the Oval Office and of course Trump</text>
  <text start="598.809" dur="4.47">gave them some information about what</text>
  <text start="601.029" dur="5.761">the terrorists are doing they have</text>
  <text start="603.279" dur="5.191">already formulated plans on beating the</text>
  <text start="606.79" dur="4.769">terrorists now the president has the</text>
  <text start="608.47" dur="5.01">right to do this and we can see right</text>
  <text start="611.559" dur="4.05">now that general mattis is out there and</text>
  <text start="613.48" dur="4.589">he&amp;#39;s saying that we are going to carry</text>
  <text start="615.609" dur="4.83">out annihilation campaign so we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="618.069" dur="7.14">simply translate the problem from one</text>
  <text start="620.439" dur="8.94">location to another instead our intent</text>
  <text start="625.209" dur="7.261">is that the foreign fighters don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="629.379" dur="6.36">out now it&amp;#39;s funny how we call them the</text>
  <text start="632.47" dur="6.149">foreign fighters because the actual</text>
  <text start="635.739" dur="6.301">terrorist groups in there they are the</text>
  <text start="638.619" dur="6.45">paid mercenaries they&amp;#39;re not part of</text>
  <text start="642.04" dur="4.62">Syria they&amp;#39;re not part I mean the whole</text>
  <text start="645.069" dur="3.6">thing is made up of paid mercenaries</text>
  <text start="646.66" dur="5.82">from the deep state we&amp;#39;ve known this for</text>
  <text start="648.669" dur="6.27">a very long time mattis also reported</text>
  <text start="652.48" dur="5.609">that Trump has delegated the ability to</text>
  <text start="654.939" dur="6.781">authorize military operations to him and</text>
  <text start="658.089" dur="6.631">to commanders on the ground to speed up</text>
  <text start="661.72" dur="5.399">these operations now a lot of people</text>
  <text start="664.72" dur="3.899">saying wow Trump just gave all the power</text>
  <text start="667.119" dur="4.02">to the Pentagon now remember the</text>
  <text start="668.619" dur="3.96">Pentagon is made up of those people that</text>
  <text start="671.139" dur="4.8">are working with them and then there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="672.579" dur="5.82">other individuals who want the war like</text>
  <text start="675.939" dur="5.15">the deep state so there&amp;#39;s two sides here</text>
  <text start="678.399" dur="5.13">the people that he&amp;#39;s giving the power to</text>
  <text start="681.089" dur="4.631">they are working with him they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="706.109" dur="8.38">strategizing to basically I should say</text>
  <text start="710.35" dur="8.399">covertly maneuver a position where he</text>
  <text start="714.489" dur="6.18">controls the entire situation now a lot</text>
  <text start="718.749" dur="2.981">of people are sitting there going how</text>
  <text start="720.669" dur="3.16">could this possibly be</text>
  <text start="721.73" dur="4.38">there&amp;#39;s no ways in this he&amp;#39;s working for</text>
  <text start="723.829" dur="4.141">the bankers actually he isn&amp;#39;t he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="731.57" dur="5.1">working with many countries and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="733.82" dur="4.56">working with many individuals to help</text>
  <text start="736.67" dur="3.659">them through this now the corporate</text>
  <text start="738.38" dur="5.94">media is going to keep everyone busy</text>
  <text start="740.329" dur="5.7">with commis father with what Comey said</text>
  <text start="744.32" dur="4.709">how come he&amp;#39;s going back on his word how</text>
  <text start="746.029" dur="4.711">he lied to Congress and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="749.029" dur="2.881">going to keep up the propaganda because</text>
  <text start="750.74" dur="2.67">they have nothing else they have to keep</text>
  <text start="751.91" dur="3.69">it up with the Russian collusion and</text>
  <text start="753.41" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re going to continually put out all</text>
  <text start="755.6" dur="4.679">this propaganda to try to bring them</text>
  <text start="757.79" dur="4.71">down and this is the part of the deep</text>
  <text start="760.279" dur="4.771">state plan because they know exactly</text>
  <text start="762.5" dur="6.389">that he&amp;#39;s doing something out there he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="765.05" dur="6.029">working to bring them down and they have</text>
  <text start="768.889" dur="5.731">no way of getting at it as well they do</text>
  <text start="771.079" dur="6.721">they can create a huge event which they</text>
  <text start="774.62" dur="4.649">might do and they can assassinate them I</text>
  <text start="777.8" dur="3.089">mean they&amp;#39;re going to try lega li to get</text>
  <text start="779.269" dur="3.991">rid of them but that&amp;#39;s going to be quite</text>
  <text start="780.889" dur="3.721">difficult the mental route I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="783.26" dur="3.09">is going to work the impeachment is</text>
  <text start="784.61" dur="3.39">going to take way too long so they only</text>
  <text start="786.35" dur="5.039">really have two options is to create a</text>
  <text start="788" dur="6.029">huge event or to basically assassinate</text>
  <text start="791.389" dur="3.93">him now we need to remember and everyone</text>
  <text start="794.029" dur="3.24">thinks like well how could this be</text>
  <text start="795.319" dur="5.221">happening behind this doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="797.269" dur="5.88">remember back in 1933 with Major General</text>
  <text start="800.54" dur="5.099">Smedley Butler where the Wall Street</text>
  <text start="803.149" dur="4.021">bankers decided that a fascist</text>
  <text start="805.639" dur="3.901">dictatorship the United States based on</text>
  <text start="807.17" dur="4.229">the one they were basically on the one</text>
  <text start="809.54" dur="4.38">in Italy would be far better for the</text>
  <text start="811.399" dur="5.761">business interests than Roosevelt&amp;#39;s New</text>
  <text start="813.92" dur="5.399">Deal because his deal threatened massive</text>
  <text start="817.16" dur="4.28">wealth redistribution to recapitalize</text>
  <text start="819.319" dur="4.621">the working and middle class of America</text>
  <text start="821.44" dur="6.07">so what happened was the Wall Street</text>
  <text start="823.94" dur="6.149">tycoons back then recruited general</text>
  <text start="827.51" dur="4.889">Butler to lead the overthrow of the US</text>
  <text start="830.089" dur="4.591">government and install a Secretary of</text>
  <text start="832.399" dur="4.831">General Affairs who would be answerable</text>
  <text start="834.68" dur="4.08">to Wall Street and not the people so</text>
  <text start="837.23" dur="4.409">they were using General Smedley Butler</text>
  <text start="838.76" dur="7.35">to do this now he went along with this</text>
  <text start="841.639" dur="6.18">up until a certain point and as he was</text>
  <text start="846.11" dur="3.78">going along with this they thought yes</text>
  <text start="847.819" dur="5.7">he&amp;#39;s doing it but covertly behind the</text>
  <text start="849.89" dur="5.18">scenes he wasn&amp;#39;t going along with it he</text>
  <text start="853.519" dur="5.301">was getting ready to X</text>
  <text start="855.07" dur="6.09">who&amp;#39;s them he was getting ready to show</text>
  <text start="858.82" dur="5.04">that this is what the wall strength Wall</text>
  <text start="861.16" dur="4.35">Street bankers were doing and when he</text>
  <text start="863.86" dur="4.65">did this and he brought it up to</text>
  <text start="865.51" dur="4.98">Congress which were in the pocket of</text>
  <text start="868.51" dur="4.5">Wall Street they didn&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="870.49" dur="5.58">about it they refused to act when</text>
  <text start="873.01" dur="5.36">Roosevelt learned of the planned coup he</text>
  <text start="876.07" dur="7.2">demanded the rest of the plotters but</text>
  <text start="878.37" dur="8.4">the Wall Street plotters well they said</text>
  <text start="883.27" dur="8.19">if you do this we will crash the economy</text>
  <text start="886.77" dur="7.09">so you cannot touch us remember same</text>
  <text start="891.46" dur="6.84">thing with Trump these individuals are</text>
  <text start="893.86" dur="7.29">very powerful Trump wants to own the</text>
  <text start="898.3" dur="4.89">crash he doesn&amp;#39;t want the central</text>
  <text start="901.15" dur="5.79">bankers to own it because they would own</text>
  <text start="903.19" dur="6.81">the narrative so he is working behind</text>
  <text start="906.94" dur="5.16">the scenes right now trying to make it</text>
  <text start="910" dur="3.24">seem like he&amp;#39;s still going along with</text>
  <text start="912.1" dur="4.53">what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="913.24" dur="5.85">he&amp;#39;s not really doing much he&amp;#39;s a bull</text>
  <text start="916.63" dur="5.91">in a china shop he doesn&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="919.09" dur="6.66">he&amp;#39;s doing and he&amp;#39;s a crazy man this is</text>
  <text start="922.54" dur="4.95">all part of his plan and if you notice</text>
  <text start="925.75" dur="3.63">and since we&amp;#39;ve been talking about it</text>
  <text start="927.49" dur="3.6">especially with Harley Schillinger on</text>
  <text start="929.38" dur="4.2">the interview that I did with him we can</text>
  <text start="931.09" dur="5.79">see that he&amp;#39;s manure maneuvering very</text>
  <text start="933.58" dur="5.25">very slowly and quietly because he</text>
  <text start="936.88" dur="3.42">doesn&amp;#39;t want this to really come out and</text>
  <text start="938.83" dur="3.12">we know that the corporate media is not</text>
  <text start="940.3" dur="3.12">going to report on this because they</text>
  <text start="941.95" dur="3.96">don&amp;#39;t do investigating reporting and</text>
  <text start="943.42" dur="5.67">he&amp;#39;s continually doing this and trying</text>
  <text start="945.91" dur="5.76">to gain control of the entire situation</text>
  <text start="949.09" dur="4.95">because if he can gain control out in</text>
  <text start="951.67" dur="5.43">the Middle East control the paid</text>
  <text start="954.04" dur="6.45">mercenaries have them surrounded have</text>
  <text start="957.1" dur="6.78">control within all different parts in</text>
  <text start="960.49" dur="6.99">North Korea in the Middle East he will</text>
  <text start="963.88" dur="6.15">have control over these central bankers</text>
  <text start="967.48" dur="5.94">over the deep state and he will be able</text>
  <text start="970.03" dur="6.6">to basically put his plan forward by</text>
  <text start="973.42" dur="5.73">having us join the Belton Road by</text>
  <text start="976.63" dur="4.86">crashing the system by having a plan to</text>
  <text start="979.15" dur="5.49">restart the Sydenham system do having a</text>
  <text start="981.49" dur="5.01">plan to bring back manufacturing this is</text>
  <text start="984.64" dur="4.14">all in the works does it mean it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="986.5" dur="5.28">to work we don&amp;#39;t know as of yet</text>
  <text start="988.78" dur="5.43">but we can see that he is planning to do</text>
  <text start="991.78" dur="5.79">all of this and he can&amp;#39;t do everything</text>
  <text start="994.21" dur="6.27">at once it has to be done very slowly it</text>
  <text start="997.57" dur="5.73">has to be done behind the scenes so</text>
  <text start="1000.48" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re not really looking at what he is</text>
  <text start="1003.3" dur="4.38">doing now of course they do have some</text>
  <text start="1005.34" dur="4.11">sense of what he&amp;#39;s trying to do and this</text>
  <text start="1007.68" dur="4.5">is the nervous part of this whole plan</text>
  <text start="1009.45" dur="5.13">because as they see what he&amp;#39;s doing and</text>
  <text start="1012.18" dur="4.38">as he continually does this and they get</text>
  <text start="1014.58" dur="3.45">word that we&amp;#39;ll wait a minute the forces</text>
  <text start="1016.56" dur="4.14">are actually destroying the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1018.03" dur="4.47">state the paid mercenaries we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1020.7" dur="3.36">going to war with North Korea this is</text>
  <text start="1022.5" dur="3.6">where the deep state is going to react</text>
  <text start="1024.06" dur="4.32">and they&amp;#39;re going to react in one or two</text>
  <text start="1026.1" dur="4.32">waves either going to assassinate him or</text>
  <text start="1028.38" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re going to create this event that</text>
  <text start="1030.42" dur="3.72">we&amp;#39;ve never seen before</text>
  <text start="1031.71" dur="5.1">maybe this cyber attack we can see they</text>
  <text start="1034.14" dur="5.1">demonstrated their ability to hit almost</text>
  <text start="1036.81" dur="4.14">every single system computer system out</text>
  <text start="1039.24" dur="3.48">there and bring everything to a</text>
  <text start="1040.95" dur="5.49">screeching halt and that was really</text>
  <text start="1042.72" dur="5.58">benign they have other weapons that they</text>
  <text start="1046.44" dur="4.8">can use to actually bring down the</text>
  <text start="1048.3" dur="5.7">system so this whole thing is happening</text>
  <text start="1051.24" dur="5.67">right in front of us and we are watching</text>
  <text start="1054" dur="4.83">it all being played out and a lot of it</text>
  <text start="1056.91" dur="4.23">is behind the scenes a lot of it you</text>
