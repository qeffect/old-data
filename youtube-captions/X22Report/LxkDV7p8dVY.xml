  <text start="132.31" dur="6.6">central bank system going and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="135.22" dur="7.98">about cutting the rates by a full point</text>
  <text start="138.91" dur="8.189">two points that&amp;#39;s not the plan the plan</text>
  <text start="143.2" dur="7.86">is to continually hit at the Fed over</text>
  <text start="147.099" dur="7.551">and over and over again and again Trump</text>
  <text start="151.06" dur="7.65">doesn&amp;#39;t want a full point right away or</text>
  <text start="154.65" dur="8.05">two points right away he wants to do</text>
  <text start="158.71" dur="6.84">this very slowly so he can continually</text>
  <text start="162.7" dur="6.69">at the Fed this is all part of the plan</text>
  <text start="165.55" dur="7.5">as for a point get a half a point looks</text>
  <text start="169.39" dur="7.29">good for optics and Trump right now as</text>
  <text start="173.05" dur="7.13">we know he&amp;#39;s been changing trade deals</text>
  <text start="176.68" dur="6.809">and he&amp;#39;s starting to change regulations</text>
  <text start="180.18" dur="6.58">we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot more of this</text>
  <text start="183.489" dur="5.401">now of course regulations were being put</text>
  <text start="186.76" dur="6.24">into place to make this a third world</text>
  <text start="188.89" dur="7.8">nation they were preparing this entire</text>
  <text start="193" dur="6.63">country California was the poster state</text>
  <text start="196.69" dur="5.07">this is why q continually says watch</text>
  <text start="199.63" dur="5.51">California&amp;#39;s not just about voting I</text>
  <text start="201.76" dur="7.14">think it&amp;#39;s about almost everything and</text>
  <text start="205.14" dur="6.34">Trump right now he revoked an Obama era</text>
  <text start="208.9" dur="5.72">waiver allowing California to set its</text>
  <text start="211.48" dur="6.569">own standards for automobile admissions</text>
  <text start="214.62" dur="6.699">now Trump claims this will lead to more</text>
  <text start="218.049" dur="5.94">jobs safer and less costly vehicles he</text>
  <text start="221.319" dur="4.471">tweeted out the following the Trump</text>
  <text start="223.989" dur="3.991">administration is revoking California&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="225.79" dur="4.949">federal waiver on emissions in order to</text>
  <text start="227.98" dur="5.099">produce far less expensive cars for the</text>
  <text start="230.739" dur="5.701">consumer while at the same time making</text>
  <text start="233.079" dur="5.19">the cars substantially safer this will</text>
  <text start="236.44" dur="4.71">lead to more production because of the</text>
  <text start="238.269" dur="4.951">pricing and safety advantage and also</text>
  <text start="241.15" dur="3.48">due to the fact that older highly</text>
  <text start="243.22" dur="3.389">polluting cars will be replaced by new</text>
  <text start="244.63" dur="3.78">extremely environmentally friendly cars</text>
  <text start="246.609" dur="2.761">will be very little difference in</text>
  <text start="248.41" dur="3.66">emissions between the California</text>
  <text start="249.37" dur="7.02">standard and the new u.s. standard but</text>
  <text start="252.07" dur="6.84">the cars will be far safer and much less</text>
  <text start="256.39" dur="4.89">expensive many more cars will be</text>
  <text start="258.91" dur="5.4">produced under the new and uniform</text>
  <text start="261.28" dur="5.94">standard meaning significantly more jobs</text>
  <text start="264.31" dur="4.62">jobs jobs water makers should seize this</text>
  <text start="267.22" dur="4.29">opportunity because without this</text>
  <text start="268.93" dur="6.239">alternative to California you&amp;#39;ll be out</text>
  <text start="271.51" dur="5.4">of business now this move comes after</text>
  <text start="275.169" dur="3.181">the Department of Justice earlier this</text>
  <text start="276.91" dur="4.29">month launched an antitrust</text>
  <text start="278.35" dur="6.18">investigation into a July deal between</text>
  <text start="281.2" dur="8.45">California and four automakers Ford</text>
  <text start="284.53" dur="7.74">Volkswagen Honda and BMW and Trump</text>
  <text start="289.65" dur="5.32">directly directly attacked the July deal</text>
  <text start="292.27" dur="3.78">with California with the tweet back in</text>
  <text start="294.97" dur="3.78">August</text>
  <text start="296.05" dur="4.89">he tweeted out the following Henry Ford</text>
  <text start="298.75" dur="3.96">would be very disappointed if he saw his</text>
  <text start="300.94" dur="4.5">modern-day descendants wanting to build</text>
  <text start="302.71" dur="4.41">a much more expensive car that is far</text>
  <text start="305.44" dur="4.05">less safe and doesn&amp;#39;t work as well</text>
  <text start="307.12" dur="4.919">because execs don&amp;#39;t want to fight</text>
  <text start="309.49" dur="4.56">California regulators car companies</text>
  <text start="312.039" dur="4.35">should know that when this</text>
  <text start="314.05" dur="3.39">administration&amp;#39;s alternative is no</text>
  <text start="316.389" dur="3.15">longer available</text>
  <text start="317.44" dur="4.949">California will squeeze them to a point</text>
  <text start="319.539" dur="4.741">of business ruin only reason California</text>
  <text start="322.389" dur="4.131">is now talking to them is because the</text>
  <text start="324.28" dur="5.72">feds are giving a far better alternative</text>
  <text start="326.52" dur="6.7">which is much better for consumers</text>
  <text start="330" dur="4.03">now of course California they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="333.22" dur="3.24">to fight this</text>
  <text start="334.03" dur="4.44">they don&amp;#39;t want Trump to remove this</text>
  <text start="336.46" dur="4.26">regulation they&amp;#39;re making deals with</text>
  <text start="338.47" dur="3.78">certain car companies which means many</text>
  <text start="340.72" dur="5.129">of the other car companies we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="342.25" dur="5.28">to be put out of the picture and this is</text>
  <text start="345.849" dur="3.391">why the Department of Justice is looking</text>
  <text start="347.53" dur="4.949">into this and we could see that</text>
  <text start="349.24" dur="5.389">regulations are being changed they have</text>
  <text start="352.479" dur="4.981">to be changed think about how many</text>
  <text start="354.629" dur="5.861">regulations there are in the US and how</text>
  <text start="357.46" dur="4.29">many businesses were driven out of the</text>
  <text start="360.49" dur="4.229">United States because of these</text>
  <text start="361.75" dur="4.979">regulations it didn&amp;#39;t make the country</text>
  <text start="364.719" dur="5.431">stronger or better it didn&amp;#39;t produce</text>
  <text start="366.729" dur="8.37">more jobs actually we lost companies we</text>
  <text start="370.15" dur="6.419">lost manufacturers we lost jobs and this</text>
  <text start="375.099" dur="3.961">is something we cannot afford because</text>
  <text start="376.569" dur="5.041">we&amp;#39;re going down the path where this</text>
  <text start="379.06" dur="4.59">entire system that we&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="381.61" dur="3.48">gigantic illusion that the central bank</text>
  <text start="383.65" dur="4.139">was created where we&amp;#39;re the foot worth</text>
  <text start="385.09" dur="5.66">we&amp;#39;re the reserve currency right now</text>
  <text start="387.789" dur="6.301">that is disappearing</text>
  <text start="390.75" dur="6.49">once it disappears and why is it</text>
  <text start="394.09" dur="6.93">disappearing because the central bank</text>
  <text start="397.24" dur="5.82">system only lasts between 40 to 50 years</text>
  <text start="401.02" dur="4.709">somewhere in that time frame then it</text>
  <text start="403.06" dur="5.909">collapses under its own debt weight and</text>
  <text start="405.729" dur="5.761">they have to restart it and when they</text>
  <text start="408.969" dur="5.161">restart it it&amp;#39;s not the same country</text>
  <text start="411.49" dur="4.039">that&amp;#39;s the reserve currency that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="414.13" dur="4.71">the way their system works</text>
  <text start="415.529" dur="6.04">the Patriots what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="418.84" dur="5.18">they&amp;#39;re making sure that this system is</text>
  <text start="421.569" dur="5.4">not restored it anywhere in this world</text>
  <text start="424.02" dur="4.57">that we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re gonna create a new</text>
  <text start="426.969" dur="4.681">system that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="428.59" dur="6.69">people-driven not private western</text>
  <text start="431.65" dur="5.519">central bank driven big difference why</text>
  <text start="435.28" dur="4.37">do you think Trump is pushing the</text>
  <text start="437.169" dur="5.401">interest rates down to zero makes the</text>
  <text start="439.65" dur="4.87">private western central banks obsolete</text>
  <text start="442.57" dur="6.03">at that point we&amp;#39;re not borrowing money</text>
  <text start="444.52" dur="6.3">anymore which means the interest on the</text>
  <text start="448.6" dur="5.88">debt as it as the interest rate</text>
  <text start="450.82" dur="8.67">continually Falls becomes less and less</text>
  <text start="454.48" dur="7.59">and less which means Trump has more room</text>
  <text start="459.49" dur="4.29">to build the infrastructure with no</text>
  <text start="462.07" dur="6.15">interest think about if the interest</text>
  <text start="463.78" dur="6.72">rates went to negative incredible now</text>
  <text start="468.22" dur="5.3">very interestingly couple reports ago we</text>
  <text start="470.5" dur="5.639">talked about how there is precious metal</text>
  <text start="473.52" dur="4.899">manipulation everyone said it was a</text>
  <text start="476.139" dur="4.951">conspiracy that this is not happening</text>
  <text start="478.419" dur="5.851">but guess what the Justice Department</text>
  <text start="481.09" dur="5">looked at it and they said yeah JP</text>
  <text start="484.27" dur="5.36">Morgan Bear Stearns and many other banks</text>
  <text start="486.09" dur="7.21">you know what they&amp;#39;re doing now they are</text>
  <text start="489.63" dur="7.26">expanding their probe to other markets</text>
  <text start="493.3" dur="6.47">why because there&amp;#39;s manipulation</text>
  <text start="496.89" dur="5.74">everywhere and now they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="499.77" dur="4.899">all different markets not just precious</text>
  <text start="502.63" dur="4.349">metals are still probing into this why</text>
  <text start="504.669" dur="5.281">they still probing into this because</text>
  <text start="506.979" dur="5.161">what they said was for many years there</text>
  <text start="509.95" dur="6">was blatant manipulation of precious</text>
  <text start="512.14" dur="6.54">metals and was precisely that and now</text>
  <text start="515.95" dur="5.639">the participants in said manipulating</text>
  <text start="518.68" dur="5.54">cabal are being treated as a mafia</text>
  <text start="521.589" dur="5.281">syndicate by the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="524.22" dur="4.57">this is just not like one person sitting</text>
  <text start="526.87" dur="5.43">there manipulating the precious metals</text>
  <text start="528.79" dur="6.93">market this is a syndicate that was</text>
  <text start="532.3" dur="7.56">designed to keep gold silver and other</text>
  <text start="535.72" dur="7.02">metals suppressed and that is being</text>
  <text start="539.86" dur="4.349">removed yes you&amp;#39;re going to see gold and</text>
  <text start="542.74" dur="4.2">silver in the reddit the other precious</text>
  <text start="544.209" dur="5.371">metals bob up and down but don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="546.94" dur="5.85">about that because once all manipulation</text>
  <text start="549.58" dur="6.33">is removed and gold and silver they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="552.79" dur="5.49">allowed to do what they do best which is</text>
  <text start="555.91" dur="5.71">the insurance policy against fiat</text>
  <text start="558.28" dur="5.8">currency as fiha d values</text>
  <text start="561.62" dur="4.77">and becomes less and less valuable what</text>
  <text start="564.08" dur="3.78">happens the gold and silver it rises</text>
  <text start="566.39" dur="3.72">actually if you look at us that clock</text>
  <text start="567.86" dur="5.01">dota org they&amp;#39;re saying gold should be</text>
  <text start="570.11" dur="6.66">around 6600 right now and silver should</text>
  <text start="572.87" dur="6.05">be around 800 right now and yes both of</text>
  <text start="576.77" dur="5.72">these metals were suppressed like others</text>
  <text start="578.92" dur="7.18">now Trump is warning China right now</text>
  <text start="582.49" dur="6.97">listen you better make the deal before</text>
  <text start="586.1" dur="6.21">the elections because once I win a</text>
  <text start="589.46" dur="5.4">second term the deal</text>
  <text start="592.31" dur="6.27">it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot worse for you I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="594.86" dur="6.29">gonna be much tougher on what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="598.58" dur="6.27">talking about why would he do this</text>
  <text start="601.15" dur="5.02">because in his second term he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="604.85" dur="3.81">have to Brewer worried about being</text>
  <text start="606.17" dur="5.13">reelected there&amp;#39;s nothing holding him</text>
  <text start="608.66" dur="5.31">back he can go all out and think about</text>
  <text start="611.3" dur="6.2">what he&amp;#39;s done in his first term he has</text>
  <text start="613.97" dur="8.6">removed the swamp removed the blocks</text>
  <text start="617.5" dur="9.01">taken control and once you have control</text>
  <text start="622.57" dur="6.16">guess what the gloves come off and you</text>
  <text start="626.51" dur="5.4">can push forward I mean look what</text>
  <text start="628.73" dur="6.84">happened today we talked about how the</text>
  <text start="631.91" dur="6.78">Fed is going to cut rates and what did</text>
  <text start="635.57" dur="4.86">they do they cut rates now everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="638.69" dur="3.78">gonna say well he wanted a point and</text>
  <text start="640.43" dur="2.82">they only did a quarter point Oh see he</text>
  <text start="642.47" dur="3.989">didn&amp;#39;t get what he wanted</text>
  <text start="643.25" dur="7.35">think about the strategy think about the</text>
  <text start="646.459" dur="6.421">plan ask for a point you get a quarter</text>
  <text start="650.6" dur="4.17">asked for another point you get a quirk</text>
  <text start="652.88" dur="6.38">why would he do this</text>
  <text start="654.77" dur="8.1">remember the plan is to demonize the Fed</text>
  <text start="659.26" dur="7.949">get rid of the Fed and restructure the</text>
  <text start="662.87" dur="7.26">Fed and have gold rise at the same time</text>
  <text start="667.209" dur="5.041">think about what he&amp;#39;s doing if the Fed</text>
  <text start="670.13" dur="5.09">just went ahead and he wanted you know</text>
  <text start="672.25" dur="5.08">zero rate right now and they just did it</text>
  <text start="675.22" dur="5.02">he wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to hit the Fed any</text>
  <text start="677.33" dur="6.78">more yes he might be able to do it with</text>
  <text start="680.24" dur="6.09">stimulus but he wants the ability to</text>
  <text start="684.11" dur="4.32">continually hit the Fed plus he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="686.33" dur="3.69">want to cut rate so much that it</text>
  <text start="688.43" dur="3.3">disrupts anything you do it very slowly</text>
  <text start="690.02" dur="3.87">just like they were raising the rates</text>
