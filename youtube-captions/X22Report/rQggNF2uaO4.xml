  <text start="56.57" dur="5.009">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="57.92" dur="6.66">episode 1618 a and today&amp;#39;s date is July</text>
  <text start="61.579" dur="6.271">18th 2018 and the thought of the episode</text>
  <text start="64.58" dur="6.3">is the plan hi data and bring the stock</text>
  <text start="67.85" dur="5.49">market down let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="70.88" dur="5.25">collapse financial news now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="73.34" dur="4.11">talking about how each side is going to</text>
  <text start="76.13" dur="3.84">try to control the narrative and we</text>
  <text start="77.45" dur="5.07">already see what the central bank is</text>
  <text start="79.97" dur="4.14">doing and they&amp;#39;re really pushing their</text>
  <text start="82.52" dur="2.31">agenda forward because they realized the</text>
  <text start="84.11" dur="3.03">economy</text>
  <text start="84.83" dur="4.59">well it&amp;#39;s falling apart very very</text>
  <text start="87.14" dur="5.13">quickly and they&amp;#39;re very worried that</text>
  <text start="89.42" dur="4.68">they will lose control and they like the</text>
  <text start="92.27" dur="4.56">control because they want to form their</text>
  <text start="94.1" dur="4.32">narrative as the economy falls apart and</text>
  <text start="96.83" dur="4.77">yesterday we talked about how we were in</text>
  <text start="98.42" dur="4.92">stage two of this housing bubble moving</text>
  <text start="101.6" dur="4.049">into stage three and if we look at</text>
  <text start="103.34" dur="4.74">housing right now housing should be</text>
  <text start="105.649" dur="4.11">booming at this time prices should not</text>
  <text start="108.08" dur="3.599">be coming down we should see a huge</text>
  <text start="109.759" dur="4.101">amount of traffic we should see mortgage</text>
  <text start="111.679" dur="5.911">applications moving up we should see</text>
  <text start="113.86" dur="6.399">starts permits all of it moving up now</text>
  <text start="117.59" dur="5.9">in May we saw that building permits they</text>
  <text start="120.259" dur="5.461">plunged and June they expected that</text>
  <text start="123.49" dur="4.18">everything was going to rebound but it</text>
  <text start="125.72" dur="3.149">didn&amp;#39;t hermits dropped two point two</text>
  <text start="127.67" dur="3.39">percent month and month</text>
  <text start="128.869" dur="4.71">housing starts collapsed twelve point</text>
  <text start="131.06" dur="4.41">three percent month on month this is the</text>
  <text start="133.579" dur="4.651">third month of declining permits in a</text>
  <text start="135.47" dur="6.45">row and the biggest drop since November</text>
  <text start="138.23" dur="5.3">of 2016 now total housing starts decline</text>
  <text start="141.92" dur="4.62">year-on-year for the first time since</text>
  <text start="143.53" dur="5.56">2017 of December and what we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="146.54" dur="3.84">at right now is everything is starting</text>
  <text start="149.09" dur="3.929">to break apart and fall apart</text>
  <text start="150.38" dur="5.04">deteriorate and everything is declining</text>
  <text start="153.019" dur="4.801">now again we mentioned it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="155.42" dur="5.039">here in the United States it&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="157.82" dur="4.86">all around the world as the Fed</text>
  <text start="160.459" dur="4.59">continually raises its interest rates</text>
  <text start="162.68" dur="4.649">the LIBOR continually pushes up it</text>
  <text start="165.049" dur="3.66">pushes many many individuals out of the</text>
  <text start="167.329" dur="3.421">market and we&amp;#39;re starting to see the</text>
  <text start="168.709" dur="3.631">effects of this now of course the Fed is</text>
  <text start="170.75" dur="3.48">doing this very very slowly</text>
  <text start="172.34" dur="3.149">they don&amp;#39;t want everyone to catch on and</text>
  <text start="174.23" dur="4.97">what they&amp;#39;re doing if you just look back</text>
  <text start="175.489" dur="6.96">in time and you look back prior to 2008</text>
  <text start="179.2" dur="4.81">2005-2006 then especially into 2007 you</text>
  <text start="182.449" dur="3.841">can see they were raising the rate and</text>
  <text start="184.01" dur="3.15">they quickly then started to drop them</text>
  <text start="186.29" dur="2.52">because they real</text>
  <text start="187.16" dur="3.24">what was happening in the housing market</text>
  <text start="188.81" dur="3.3">and this is when we saw people in</text>
  <text start="190.4" dur="3.72">California with their adjustable</text>
  <text start="192.11" dur="3.81">adjustable rate mortgages they just left</text>
  <text start="194.12" dur="4.62">their homes left everything inside and</text>
  <text start="195.92" dur="4.32">they just couldn&amp;#39;t afford to stay in</text>
  <text start="198.74" dur="3.63">those house and now remember there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="200.24" dur="3.45">lot of speculation out there there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="202.37" dur="2.94">lot of people doing a lot of different</text>
  <text start="203.69" dur="4.86">things and we&amp;#39;re starting to see a</text>
  <text start="205.31" dur="6.03">problem in the housing market now if we</text>
  <text start="208.55" dur="4.41">look at the Fed we know what their plan</text>
  <text start="211.34" dur="4.02">is we know what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="212.96" dur="4.37">here the Fed is saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="215.36" dur="6.12">going to be raising the interest rates</text>
  <text start="217.33" dur="5.53">they&amp;#39;re going to push it up and remember</text>
  <text start="221.48" dur="3.87">everyone&amp;#39;s talking about the Treasury</text>
  <text start="222.86" dur="5.16">yield curve it&amp;#39;s going to invert which</text>
  <text start="225.35" dur="3.93">means it indicates a recession and we</text>
  <text start="228.02" dur="3.87">need to think about what the Fed has</text>
  <text start="229.28" dur="5.07">been doing the Fed has been hiding data</text>
  <text start="231.89" dur="4.92">changing data making everyone think that</text>
  <text start="234.35" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re unimportant and we talked about</text>
  <text start="236.81" dur="4.74">all the different things that they were</text>
  <text start="238.37" dur="7.64">getting rid of or changing their balance</text>
  <text start="241.55" dur="6.93">sheet the change in the yield curve and</text>
  <text start="246.01" dur="6.88">when we start to look at this we can see</text>
  <text start="248.48" dur="7.41">this is the reason why they are changing</text>
  <text start="252.89" dur="5.25">how the yield curve is calculated but of</text>
  <text start="255.89" dur="4.2">course those people in the industry</text>
  <text start="258.14" dur="3.06">they&amp;#39;re gonna continue to calculate the</text>
  <text start="260.09" dur="2.76">yield curve like they have always done</text>
  <text start="261.2" dur="3.15">but the Fed wants to put this</text>
  <text start="262.85" dur="3.45">information out there and they want</text>
  <text start="264.35" dur="4.98">everyone to start looking at the way</text>
  <text start="266.3" dur="6.84">they&amp;#39;re doing it because they understand</text>
  <text start="269.33" dur="6.39">that this is an indicator of a recession</text>
  <text start="273.14" dur="5.79">and this is exactly what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="275.72" dur="5.88">here now when we look at this why is the</text>
  <text start="278.93" dur="4.68">Fed worried about people catching on and</text>
  <text start="281.6" dur="5.76">what the yield curve is doing well their</text>
  <text start="283.61" dur="6.24">plan might be to crash the stock market</text>
  <text start="287.36" dur="4.62">to save the bonds now the single most</text>
  <text start="289.85" dur="4.89">important bond in the world is most</text>
  <text start="291.98" dur="5.46">likely the 10-year US Treasury bond this</text>
  <text start="294.74" dur="5.1">bond represents the risk-free rate of</text>
  <text start="297.44" dur="4.32">return for a total economic cycle</text>
  <text start="299.84" dur="3.93">roughly 10 years to nominate in the</text>
  <text start="301.76" dur="5.22">global reserve currency which is the US</text>
  <text start="303.77" dur="5.34">dollar put simply this is the bond to</text>
  <text start="306.98" dur="5.61">watch if you want to keep an eye on how</text>
  <text start="309.11" dur="7.02">financial systems are acting it is the</text>
  <text start="312.59" dur="5.4">bedrock for all risk and its yield</text>
  <text start="316.13" dur="5.01">represents rate of return against which</text>
  <text start="317.99" dur="6.06">all risk assets are priced and value</text>
  <text start="321.14" dur="4.62">now with all that in mind we need to</text>
  <text start="324.05" dur="3.66">note that they yield on the 10-year US</text>
  <text start="325.76" dur="4.11">Treasury has broken above it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="327.71" dur="5.28">long-term 20-year bull market trendline</text>
  <text start="329.87" dur="6.81">this is a major problem and the Fed is</text>
  <text start="332.99" dur="7.5">going to fix it by crashing stocks so</text>
  <text start="336.68" dur="6">the fact is is that the Fed has to act</text>
  <text start="340.49" dur="4.83">to stop the bond bubble from bursting</text>
  <text start="342.68" dur="5.01">and it&amp;#39;s going to do this by of course</text>
  <text start="345.32" dur="4.71">crushing the stocks and driving capital</text>
  <text start="347.69" dur="5.49">into the bond market to force yields</text>
  <text start="350.03" dur="5.22">lower what does this mean the stock</text>
  <text start="353.18" dur="5.13">market is now on borrowed time and</text>
  <text start="355.25" dur="5.46">remember they have the ability to pump</text>
  <text start="358.31" dur="4.98">the stock market up they already have</text>
  <text start="360.71" dur="5.01">central banks out there purchasing</text>
  <text start="363.29" dur="3.93">stocks they have banks where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="365.72" dur="3.45">receiving the free money they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="367.22" dur="4.8">in and they&amp;#39;re also purchasing stocks</text>
  <text start="369.17" dur="5.67">they have the ability to pump the stock</text>
  <text start="372.02" dur="5.37">market up and they know this so what</text>
  <text start="374.84" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="377.39" dur="5.49">to push the market to the edge bring it</text>
  <text start="381.02" dur="3.39">down and of course when this happens we</text>
  <text start="382.88" dur="3.84">know that certain corporations are going</text>
  <text start="384.41" dur="4.44">to say ok we need to cut back we need to</text>
  <text start="386.72" dur="4.59">layoff and it gives them the excuse to</text>
  <text start="388.85" dur="4.68">do what they like to call restructuring</text>
  <text start="391.31" dur="4.98">which is getting rid of the low lying</text>
  <text start="393.53" dur="4.86">fruit getting rid of a lot of people to</text>
  <text start="396.29" dur="4.02">save a lot of money because we know a</text>
  <text start="398.39" dur="4.59">lot of their books are fake phony and</text>
  <text start="400.31" dur="5.46">false and at this time we can see this</text>
  <text start="402.98" dur="4.74">is part of the plan of what the Fed is</text>
  <text start="405.77" dur="3.84">doing now when that comes down the</text>
  <text start="407.72" dur="3.24">economy is going to be reeling at this</text>
  <text start="409.61" dur="3.63">time but they don&amp;#39;t care about that it</text>
  <text start="410.96" dur="3.81">makes no difference to them if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="413.24" dur="3.63">doing well or not doing well because</text>
  <text start="414.77" dur="4.56">they make money either way and they have</text>
  <text start="416.87" dur="4.89">full control of the system remember</text>
  <text start="419.33" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;re not dealing in paper currency</text>
  <text start="421.76" dur="4.86">they like hard assets and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="424.67" dur="4.32">really care what happens when things</text>
  <text start="426.62" dur="5.1">start to fall apart actually they like</text>
  <text start="428.99" dur="4.56">it they like stealing the wealth from</text>
  <text start="431.72" dur="3.6">the everyday person this is what the</text>
  <text start="433.55" dur="3.54">central banks are all about now there</text>
  <text start="435.32" dur="4.11">are certain countries out there that are</text>
  <text start="437.09" dur="3.72">very nervous about central banks the</text>
  <text start="439.43" dur="3.69">private western central banks they</text>
  <text start="440.81" dur="4.62">understand what is going on and we see</text>
  <text start="443.12" dur="4.95">that Russia they have been liquidating</text>
  <text start="445.43" dur="4.89">the US Treasury holdings and if we look</text>
  <text start="448.07" dur="5.22">at this we can see that Russia they have</text>
  <text start="450.32" dur="4.409">been dumping treasury holdings according</text>
  <text start="453.29" dur="5.159">to the latest just released</text>
  <text start="454.729" dur="5.49">International Capital update tick in May</text>
  <text start="458.449" dur="4.02">the selling of Treasuries by official</text>
  <text start="460.219" dur="4.92">entities continued with another 24</text>
  <text start="462.469" dur="4.95">billion sold in the month of May when</text>
  <text start="465.139" dur="6.33">yields continued to rise and eventually</text>
  <text start="467.419" dur="6.72">hit the 2018 highs of 3.1 1% and this</text>
  <text start="471.469" dur="5.19">was Russia they were dumping Treasuries</text>
  <text start="474.139" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re protecting themselves they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="476.659" dur="4.201">want to be a part of this whole entire</text>
  <text start="478.159" dur="5.37">system when it completely comes down</text>
  <text start="480.86" dur="5.399">remember Russia does not have that much</text>
  <text start="483.529" dur="5.94">debt right now and basically if they get</text>
  <text start="486.259" dur="4.74">rid of these Treasuries they are then</text>
  <text start="489.469" dur="5.04">protecting themselves now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="490.999" dur="5.371">interesting is that powell he was</text>
  <text start="494.509" dur="6.77">testifying in front of the senate</text>
  <text start="496.37" dur="9.389">committee and senator heidi heitkamp</text>
  <text start="501.279" dur="6.73">decided to ask powell a question and she</text>
  <text start="505.759" dur="4.62">cited a speech from former Fed chair Ben</text>
  <text start="508.009" dur="6.57">Bernanke in attempt to get panel to be</text>
  <text start="510.379" dur="6.181">more specific with her question she said</text>
  <text start="514.579" dur="4.56">would you agree with Ben Bernanke when</text>
  <text start="516.56" dur="5.279">he said in 2007 a speech that he made on</text>
  <text start="519.139" dur="5.01">trade that restricting trade by imposing</text>
  <text start="521.839" dur="5.011">tariffs quotas or other barriers is</text>
  <text start="524.149" dur="5.271">exactly the wrong thing to do for the</text>
  <text start="526.85" dur="5.7">economy this is what she asked Powell</text>
  <text start="529.42" dur="5.32">Powell&amp;#39;s response was simple assuming</text>
  <text start="532.55" dur="4.409">you&amp;#39;re talking about them remaining in</text>
  <text start="534.74" dur="4.49">place over a sustained period of time</text>
  <text start="536.959" dur="4.891">absolutely</text>
  <text start="539.23" dur="3.909">Powell also made his most direct warning</text>
  <text start="541.85" dur="4.679">about the risk to the economy as a</text>
  <text start="543.139" dur="5.7">result of escalating trade wars he went</text>
  <text start="546.529" dur="4.86">on to say we hear from our extensive</text>
  <text start="548.839" dur="5.101">network of business contacts a rising</text>
  <text start="551.389" dur="4.471">course of concern as you pointed out</text>
  <text start="553.94" dur="4.74">lots and lots of individual companies</text>
  <text start="555.86" dur="4.8">have been harmed by this we don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="558.68" dur="4.32">this in the aggregate numbers yet</text>
  <text start="560.66" dur="4.71">because it&amp;#39;s a 20 trillion economy and</text>
  <text start="563" dur="4.17">these things take time to show up but we</text>
  <text start="565.37" dur="4.38">hear many many stories of companies that</text>
  <text start="567.17" dur="4.83">are concerned and now beginning to make</text>
  <text start="569.75" dur="5.279">investment decisions or not make them</text>
  <text start="572" dur="4.38">because of this now remember Powell is</text>
  <text start="575.029" dur="2.99">out there and he&amp;#39;s saying that the</text>
  <text start="576.38" dur="3.42">economy is doing fantastically</text>
  <text start="578.019" dur="5.05">everything that they&amp;#39;ve done has</text>
  <text start="579.8" dur="6.539">improved the economy and these tariffs</text>
  <text start="583.069" dur="4.651">and these tax cuts well this is</text>
  <text start="586.339" dur="4.281">uncharted waters</text>
  <text start="587.72" dur="5.82">and it might bring the whole system down</text>
  <text start="590.62" dur="5.589">once again what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="593.54" dur="4.32">trying to create this narrative of why</text>
  <text start="596.209" dur="4.55">this is all going to fall apart and we</text>
  <text start="597.86" dur="7.05">need to remember the central bankers</text>
  <text start="600.759" dur="6.041">this is their system this is what</text>
  <text start="604.91" dur="5.789">they&amp;#39;re protecting and anything that</text>
  <text start="606.8" dur="5.07">goes against what their system is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="610.699" dur="3.57">going to be no it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="611.87" dur="5.159">disaster it&amp;#39;s gonna be no good just like</text>
  <text start="614.269" dur="5.43">when the brexit votes was was being held</text>
  <text start="617.029" dur="5.641">what did they tell us if the people</text>
  <text start="619.699" dur="6.901">decide to vote themselves away from the</text>
  <text start="622.67" dur="7.349">EU the entire economy would completely</text>
  <text start="626.6" dur="6.659">fall apart in the UK and then we had the</text>
  <text start="630.019" dur="5.82">brexit vote and what happened well it</text>
  <text start="633.259" dur="4.801">didn&amp;#39;t it didn&amp;#39;t fall apart they were</text>
  <text start="635.839" dur="5.49">completely wrong even now they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="638.06" dur="6.24">if they go ahead and they detach</text>

  <text start="644.3" dur="4.17">hard brexit not this ridiculous brexit</text>
  <text start="646.339" dur="4.831">that may came up with their economy</text>
  <text start="648.47" dur="4.95">would implode basically the central</text>
  <text start="651.17" dur="4.889">bankers they do the same thing as the</text>

  <text start="656.059" dur="4.741">scare people they put fear into</text>
  <text start="657.939" dur="4.15">individuals because what they really</text>
  <text start="660.8" dur="4.2">want is they want to make sure that</text>
  <text start="662.089" dur="5.281">everyone understands that if you try to</text>
  <text start="665" dur="3.649">leave the central banking system the</text>

  <text start="668.649" dur="4.901">you will not be able to survive why do</text>
  <text start="671.629" dur="4.71">you think the central bank the biz is</text>
  <text start="673.55" dur="6.029">out there and they&amp;#39;re trying to explain</text>
  <text start="676.339" dur="5.911">why you can&amp;#39;t have a different currency</text>
  <text start="679.579" dur="4.771">than the one that they are issuing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="682.25" dur="5.339">completely impossible it won&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="684.35" dur="6.239">don&amp;#39;t even try don&amp;#39;t even try to use</text>
  <text start="687.589" dur="4.831">cryptocurrency don&amp;#39;t even try to create</text>
  <text start="690.589" dur="3.75">your own currency it&amp;#39;s not going to work</text>
  <text start="692.42" dur="4.2">it&amp;#39;s not centralized it has to be a</text>
  <text start="694.339" dur="4.411">centralized currency the central banks</text>
  <text start="696.62" dur="4.05">have to handle everything they have to</text>
  <text start="698.75" dur="3.509">handle everything with trade they have</text>
  <text start="700.67" dur="2.639">to ever handle everything with interest</text>
  <text start="702.259" dur="4.14">rates they have to handle everything</text>
  <text start="703.309" dur="6.181">with the creation of currency why</text>
  <text start="706.399" dur="5.641">because they need total control of the</text>
  <text start="709.49" dur="4.62">system because their system is weak</text>
  <text start="712.04" dur="5.37">their system does not work for the</text>
  <text start="714.11" dur="6.57">people their system would rip apart if</text>
  <text start="717.41" dur="5.13">they didn&amp;#39;t control every aspect and</text>
  <text start="720.68" dur="3.93">controlling every aspect doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="722.54" dur="5.07">the system better actually what it does</text>
  <text start="724.61" dur="5.07">it hurts the everyday person and makes</text>
  <text start="727.61" dur="4.44">them wealthier and wealthier this is why</text>
  <text start="729.68" dur="4.469">we&amp;#39;re seeing wealth inequality right now</text>
  <text start="732.05" dur="4.979">because what their system has done it</text>
  <text start="734.149" dur="5.85">has destroyed everything that we have</text>
  <text start="737.029" dur="4.86">today so they&amp;#39;re laying the groundwork</text>
  <text start="739.999" dur="4.2">right now they&amp;#39;re pushing their agenda</text>
  <text start="741.889" dur="4.95">and we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot more of this</text>
  <text start="744.199" dur="4.68">and they&amp;#39;re going to continue with this</text>
  <text start="746.839" dur="4.74">theme and they&amp;#39;re not going to let up on</text>
  <text start="748.879" dur="4.2">the other side what is Trump and the</text>
  <text start="751.579" dur="3.6">Patriots doing now Trump is out there</text>
  <text start="753.079" dur="3.961">saying that this is the best economy</text>
  <text start="755.179" dur="3.84">ever now this is a pretty darn good</text>
  <text start="757.04" dur="4.649">strategy that he is using think about</text>
  <text start="759.019" dur="5.82">what he&amp;#39;s doing right now pushing the</text>
  <text start="761.689" dur="5.87">agenda to say that this economy is great</text>
  <text start="764.839" dur="5.461">it&amp;#39;s fantastic unemployment is low</text>
  <text start="767.559" dur="7.06">everything is great stock market is</text>
  <text start="770.3" dur="7.5">fantastic when it all falls apart he can</text>
  <text start="774.619" dur="5.731">make the case where the Fed was saying</text>
  <text start="777.8" dur="6.12">the economy was great and he can make</text>
  <text start="780.35" dur="5.429">the case saying well we got this economy</text>
  <text start="783.92" dur="4.109">from Obama the economy was doing</text>
  <text start="785.779" dur="4.35">fantastically all the numbers that you</text>
  <text start="788.029" dur="4.201">were giving us like you were giving</text>
  <text start="790.129" dur="5.4">Obama showed that the economy was doing</text>
  <text start="792.23" dur="5.099">fantastically what happened here now of</text>
  <text start="795.529" dur="3.6">course they&amp;#39;re going to try to blame the</text>
  <text start="797.329" dur="3.541">tariffs and they&amp;#39;re gonna try to make</text>
  <text start="799.129" dur="3.421">the case that it was the tariffs they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="800.87" dur="3.87">gonna come out with some type of story</text>
  <text start="802.55" dur="3.42">just like they did in the 70s where they</text>
  <text start="804.74" dur="2.579">said we had to come off the gold center</text>
  <text start="805.97" dur="2.52">because the speculators but if you</text>
  <text start="807.319" dur="3.21">notice they never really showed any</text>
  <text start="808.49" dur="3.18">proof they really never showed what was</text>
  <text start="810.529" dur="2.521">really going on they just had the</text>
  <text start="811.67" dur="3.93">mainstream media come out and tell us</text>
  <text start="813.05" dur="5.129">that it was speculators that this is why</text>
  <text start="815.6" dur="3.779">we have to do this so what does Trump</text>
  <text start="818.179" dur="3.241">and the Patriots need to do at this</text>
  <text start="819.379" dur="4.491">point and we know that Rand Paul is</text>
  <text start="821.42" dur="7.709">behind this all they need to do is</text>
  <text start="823.87" dur="8.23">present evidence truth to show that the</text>
  <text start="829.129" dur="6.661">tariffs had no effect on the economy</text>
  <text start="832.1" dur="6.179">whatsoever and show what the central</text>
  <text start="835.79" dur="6.63">banks have done it&amp;#39;s very very simple</text>
  <text start="838.279" dur="6.54">and once they do this he could then take</text>
  <text start="842.42" dur="5.399">it to the next level and say well</text>
  <text start="844.819" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;ve done this this and that maybe we</text>
  <text start="847.819" dur="5.051">should look a little bit closer to see</text>
  <text start="849.379" dur="6.311">what else they&amp;#39;ve been doing and</text>
  <text start="852.87" dur="5.28">can get the ball rolling here and of</text>
  <text start="855.69" dur="5.49">course in his position with other</text>
  <text start="858.15" dur="6.18">Patriots they know exactly what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="861.18" dur="6.18">going on they know exactly how the Fed</text>
  <text start="864.33" dur="6.09">works they know exactly what is</text>
  <text start="867.36" dur="8.07">happening here so they do have the</text>
  <text start="870.42" dur="8.51">ability to create their narrative to</text>
  <text start="875.43" dur="6.96">bring it out into the open and to show</text>
  <text start="878.93" dur="5.71">the American people what has really been</text>
  <text start="882.39" dur="4.199">going on because again we have no idea</text>
  <text start="884.64" dur="4.62">what the Fed is doing we have no idea</text>
  <text start="886.589" dur="4.411">what their books look like we have no</text>
  <text start="889.26" dur="3.65">idea about anything and they&amp;#39;re supposed</text>
  <text start="891" dur="4.589">to be working for the people and</text>
  <text start="892.91" dur="5.38">actually controlling the people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="895.589" dur="5.221">economy but they&amp;#39;re a private entity</text>
  <text start="898.29" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;re not part of the government it is</text>
  <text start="900.81" dur="6.09">now time to look inside of the Fed to</text>
  <text start="904.47" dur="5.55">see what they&amp;#39;ve been up to all along</text>
  <text start="906.9" dur="7.35">and I think this is going to be the</text>
  <text start="910.02" dur="7.5">ultimate bombshell and this is going to</text>
  <text start="914.25" dur="6.42">be the ultimate takedown of the central</text>
  <text start="917.52" dur="6.03">bank the deep state but one thing is for</text>
  <text start="920.67" dur="4.68">sure the system&amp;#39;s gonna have to restart</text>
  <text start="923.55" dur="4.5">and we&amp;#39;re gonna go through a transition</text>
  <text start="925.35" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s gonna be a little tough this is why</text>
  <text start="928.05" dur="3">you need to prepare this is why you need</text>
  <text start="929.73" dur="3.24">food and water because when credit</text>
  <text start="931.05" dur="6.63">freezes up when they&amp;#39;re trying to get</text>
  <text start="932.97" dur="8.61">rid of the central bank when you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="937.68" dur="6.18">get supplies from stores when we see</text>
  <text start="941.58" dur="4.83">inflation when we&amp;#39;re moving to a new</text>
  <text start="943.86" dur="5.34">currency it&amp;#39;s gonna take a little while</text>
  <text start="946.41" dur="4.619">for things to calm down think about the</text>
  <text start="949.2" dur="4.259">1970s when we&amp;#39;re coming off the gold</text>
  <text start="951.029" dur="7.471">standard how many people didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="953.459" dur="7.711">jobs how we couldn&amp;#39;t get fuel in the UK</text>
  <text start="958.5" dur="5.339">there were blackouts we were going</text>
  <text start="961.17" dur="4.919">through a major transition at that time</text>
  <text start="963.839" dur="4.471">this time it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot worse</text>
  <text start="966.089" dur="4.44">last time we didn&amp;#39;t have this much debt</text>
  <text start="968.31" dur="5.58">last time we didn&amp;#39;t have all these</text>
  <text start="970.529" dur="5.011">problems last time we&amp;#39;re moving from the</text>
  <text start="973.89" dur="4.34">gold standard on to the Fiat system</text>
  <text start="975.54" dur="4.77">guess what the dollar</text>
  <text start="978.23" dur="4.06">well that was still the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="980.31" dur="3.269">this time I don&amp;#39;t know if the dollars</text>
  <text start="982.29" dur="4.44">going to be the reserve currency most</text>
  <text start="983.579" dur="5.101">likely not and we&amp;#39;re moving to something</text>
  <text start="986.73" dur="5.039">different so we&amp;#39;re gonna go through a</text>
  <text start="988.68" dur="4.649">lot of bumps a lot of hiccups and for</text>
  <text start="991.769" dur="3.331">many people it&amp;#39;s gonna be quite tough</text>
