  <text start="123.06" dur="5.75">know that CNN they filed the lawsuit Fox</text>
  <text start="126.63" dur="5.21">News has joined and many other</text>

  <text start="138.75" dur="4.56">revoked Jim Acosta&amp;#39;s press pass both</text>
  <text start="141.39" dur="4.26">because the Constitution does not allow</text>
  <text start="143.31" dur="4.14">a federal court to issue this kind of</text>
  <text start="145.65" dur="3.93">order to the White House and because the</text>
  <text start="147.45" dur="5.789">First Amendment does not protect what</text>
  <text start="149.58" dur="5.85">Acosta did CNN and Acosta responded by</text>
  <text start="153.239" dur="4.591">filing a federal lawsuit in Washington</text>
  <text start="155.43" dur="4.08">DC alleging violations of the</text>
  <text start="157.83" dur="3.81">Constitution&amp;#39;s First Amendment and Fifth</text>
  <text start="159.51" dur="3.03">Amendment the plaintiffs are suing</text>
  <text start="161.64" dur="2.42">President Trump</text>
  <text start="162.54" dur="4.22">various White House official</text>
  <text start="164.06" dur="4.5">like chief of staff John Kelly White</text>
  <text start="166.76" dur="4.08">House press secretary Sara Huckabee</text>
  <text start="168.56" dur="6.09">Sanders and two officers from the US</text>
  <text start="170.84" dur="6.39">Secret Service director Randolph Ali&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="174.65" dur="5.49">and the and an unnamed agent who</text>
  <text start="177.23" dur="6.66">actually took the pass from Acosta this</text>
  <text start="180.14" dur="5.459">lawsuit hinges on a 1977 president from</text>
  <text start="183.89" dur="5.16">the US Court of Appeals for the DC</text>
  <text start="185.599" dur="6.841">Circuit Cheryl verse Knight so a key</text>
  <text start="189.05" dur="6.2">issue in the DC Circuit which they never</text>
  <text start="192.44" dur="5.19">considered is that this sort of lawsuit</text>
  <text start="195.25" dur="5.049">should be dismissed under the political</text>
  <text start="197.63" dur="5.97">question doctrine in Baker versus Carr</text>
  <text start="200.299" dur="5.101">the Supreme Court in 1962 identifies six</text>
  <text start="203.6" dur="4.44">factors of political cases that cannot</text>
  <text start="205.4" dur="5.1">be decided by the courts one Baker</text>
  <text start="208.04" dur="4.08">factor is that a federal court cannot</text>
  <text start="210.5" dur="4.17">decide the matter without expressing</text>
  <text start="212.12" dur="5.79">lack of respect do coordinate branches</text>
  <text start="214.67" dur="5.34">of government the white house is the</text>
  <text start="217.91" dur="5.49">president&amp;#39;s house he lives there and</text>
  <text start="220.01" dur="6">sleeps there yes it has offices but the</text>
  <text start="223.4" dur="4.35">White House is not a department it is</text>
  <text start="226.01" dur="3.569">not an agency created by Congress and</text>
  <text start="227.75" dur="4.95">subject to stand a congressional</text>
  <text start="229.579" dur="5.521">oversight it is instead the residence of</text>
  <text start="232.7" dur="5.819">the independently elected head of state</text>
  <text start="235.1" dur="6.96">and those who work there do so as part</text>
  <text start="238.519" dur="6.541">of his household staff now CNN and</text>
  <text start="242.06" dur="6.63">Acosta are asking a federal job to give</text>
  <text start="245.06" dur="6.239">the president orders concerning whom he</text>
  <text start="248.69" dur="5.04">must allow into his home the executive</text>
  <text start="251.299" dur="4.47">branch is a separate co-equal branch</text>
  <text start="253.73" dur="5.37">from the judicial branch it would be as</text>
  <text start="255.769" dur="4.951">much of an insult for a federal judge to</text>
  <text start="259.1" dur="4.17">tell the president that he must allow</text>
  <text start="260.72" dur="3.81">someone into his living room as it would</text>
  <text start="263.27" dur="3.09">be for the president to order the</text>
  <text start="264.53" dur="4.22">Supreme Court regarding whom the</text>
  <text start="266.36" dur="5.79">justices must allow into their courtroom</text>
  <text start="268.75" dur="7.15">now this is not about the ability of a</text>
  <text start="272.15" dur="6.139">reporter to cover the president Acosta</text>
  <text start="275.9" dur="5.13">can do that from outside the White House</text>
  <text start="278.289" dur="7.061">nor it is about banning a media outlet</text>
  <text start="281.03" dur="6.72">they didn&amp;#39;t ban CNN CNN right now they</text>
  <text start="285.35" dur="4.98">have about 50 employees with White House</text>
  <text start="287.75" dur="6.36">passes including perhaps a half a dozen</text>
  <text start="290.33" dur="7.559">reporters or more this is about the</text>
  <text start="294.11" dur="7.95">mainstream media going after</text>
  <text start="297.889" dur="6.12">Trump trying to make it seem like he</text>
  <text start="302.06" dur="5.12">doesn&amp;#39;t abide by the First Amendment the</text>
  <text start="304.009" dur="6.87">Fifth Amendment he&amp;#39;s crazy he&amp;#39;s unhinged</text>
  <text start="307.18" dur="5.049">this is what this is about and it looks</text>
  <text start="310.879" dur="4.59">like this might have been done on</text>
  <text start="312.229" dur="5.52">purpose now CNN in a costume</text>
  <text start="315.469" dur="4.581">they&amp;#39;re also asserting a violation of</text>
  <text start="317.749" dur="4.47">the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause</text>
  <text start="320.05" dur="4.299">claiming they have a constitutional</text>
  <text start="322.219" dur="4.26">right to advance notice of what the</text>
  <text start="324.349" dur="4.41">White House would do and a written</text>
  <text start="326.479" dur="5.97">explanation of why the White House did</text>
  <text start="328.759" dur="6.12">it actually no they do not the Due</text>
  <text start="332.449" dur="5.701">Process Clause asserts that no person</text>
  <text start="334.879" dur="6.51">shall be deprived of life liberty or</text>
  <text start="338.15" dur="5.43">property without due process of law they</text>
  <text start="341.389" dur="5.52">have no right to enter the White House</text>
  <text start="343.58" dur="5.459">to harass the president an explanation</text>
  <text start="346.909" dur="5.31">is always nice to have but it is not</text>
  <text start="349.039" dur="5.19">constitutionally required here and it</text>
  <text start="352.219" dur="6.391">looks like this is about the mainstream</text>
  <text start="354.229" dur="6.631">media going after Trump now let&amp;#39;s move</text>

  <text start="975.49" dur="7.28">there&amp;#39;s one more piece that needs to be</text>
  <text start="979" dur="8.06">put in place and once you have that</text>

  <text start="1068.1" dur="6.12">by betraying his or her country now cute</text>
  <text start="1071.97" dur="5.459">put this up on purpose and I&amp;#39;m bringing</text>
  <text start="1074.22" dur="6.06">up on purpose because as we head through</text>
  <text start="1077.429" dur="6.301">these next couple of weeks everything is</text>
  <text start="1080.28" dur="6.27">going to change we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot of</text>
  <text start="1083.73" dur="6.27">things change and the deep state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1086.55" dur="5.7">going to push their events as hard as</text>
  <text start="1090" dur="5.04">they possibly can because they know what</text>
  <text start="1092.25" dur="4.409">is coming but this has been planned from</text>
  <text start="1095.04" dur="2.22">the beginning now again can the plan</text>
  <text start="1096.659" dur="3.781">deviate</text>
  <text start="1097.26" dur="5.4">absolutely plans are not foolproof</text>
  <text start="1100.44" dur="5.25">you&amp;#39;re dealing with the other side where</text>
  <text start="1102.66" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;re going to counter moves so lower</text>
  <text start="1105.69" dur="3.24">your expectations of what you think is</text>
  <text start="1108" dur="5.88">going to happen</text>
  <text start="1108.93" dur="8.1">drop your emotions think logically think</text>
  <text start="1113.88" dur="6.54">about what needs to be done to lock</text>
  <text start="1117.03" dur="6.92">everything in before we go after the</text>
  <text start="1120.42" dur="6.33">deep state the central bank and the rest</text>
  <text start="1123.95" dur="4.69">everything has to be put in place for a</text>
  <text start="1126.75" dur="5.52">reason you can see going all the way</text>
  <text start="1128.64" dur="6.83">back why it was completely impossible to</text>
  <text start="1132.27" dur="5.52">prosecute anyone from the very beginning</text>
  <text start="1135.47" dur="4.21">this is why they had to put everything</text>
  <text start="1137.79" dur="4.38">into place because how do you do</text>
  <text start="1139.68" dur="5.76">anything if you don&amp;#39;t have the right</text>
  <text start="1142.17" dur="7.56">people in the right positions because if</text>

  <text start="1160.05" dur="6.78">those people you have to make it so</text>
  <text start="1162.66" dur="6.06">where this follows the rule of law and</text>
  <text start="1166.83" dur="3.81">there&amp;#39;s no way out of these people</text>
  <text start="1168.72" dur="5.16">because they&amp;#39;re going to have to produce</text>
  <text start="1170.64" dur="6.3">evidence real evidence which they&amp;#39;ve</text>
