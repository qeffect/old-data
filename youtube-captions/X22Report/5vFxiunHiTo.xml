  <text start="80.51" dur="5.58">call let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="82.82" dur="5.909">collapse financial news now everything</text>
  <text start="86.09" dur="6.27">is being put into place and it seems</text>
  <text start="88.729" dur="5.761">like the plan is moving forward not just</text>
  <text start="92.36" dur="6.32">with the deep state not just with the D</text>
  <text start="94.49" dur="7.83">class but with the economic narrative</text>
  <text start="98.68" dur="7.93">Trump in the Patriots they are placing</text>
  <text start="102.32" dur="7.29">all players everything in place to take</text>
  <text start="106.61" dur="6.12">down the central bank this will become</text>
  <text start="109.61" dur="6.27">apparent right after Trump wins the</text>
  <text start="112.73" dur="6.39">election but before that time Trump</text>
  <text start="115.88" dur="6.42">needs to fully control the economic</text>
  <text start="119.12" dur="5.82">narrative because if Trump the Patriots</text>
  <text start="122.3" dur="5.52">if they do not control the entire</text>
  <text start="124.94" dur="5.849">economic narrative it will be game over</text>
  <text start="127.82" dur="8.16">and the reason why I say that is because</text>
  <text start="130.789" dur="8.641">people they vote with their wallets they</text>
  <text start="135.98" dur="7.89">want their money safe they want the</text>
  <text start="139.43" dur="5.729">economy doing well and if everything</text>
  <text start="143.87" dur="4.08">comes to a screeching halt and</text>
  <text start="145.159" dur="6.451">everything collapses it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="147.95" dur="6.84">major problem this is why Trump has been</text>
  <text start="151.61" dur="6.959">positioning everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="154.79" dur="6.99">seeing for a specific purpose that is</text>
  <text start="158.569" dur="4.771">one to win the 2020 election to make</text>
  <text start="161.78" dur="2.2">sure people understand that the economy</text>
  <text start="163.34" dur="4.6">is doing great</text>
  <text start="163.98" dur="4.56">who is to put all eyes on the Fed every</text>
  <text start="167.94" dur="3.84">time</text>
  <text start="168.54" dur="6.839">Trump tweets out or says something about</text>
  <text start="171.78" dur="6.09">the economy he always refers back to the</text>
  <text start="175.379" dur="4.381">Federal Reserve they don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="177.87" dur="4.229">they&amp;#39;re doing I wish they would cut</text>
  <text start="179.76" dur="5.25">rates everyone else is doing it why</text>
  <text start="182.099" dur="6.571">isn&amp;#39;t the Fed this is all being done on</text>
  <text start="185.01" dur="5.729">purpose he tweeted out the following the</text>
  <text start="188.67" dur="3.81">EU and China will further lower interest</text>
  <text start="190.739" dur="3.981">rates and pump money into their systems</text>
  <text start="192.48" dur="4.8">making it much easier for their</text>
  <text start="194.72" dur="4.989">manufacturers to sell product in the</text>
  <text start="197.28" dur="6.45">mean time and with very low inflation</text>
  <text start="199.709" dur="6.301">our Fed does nothing and probably will</text>
  <text start="203.73" dur="6.72">do very little by comparison</text>
  <text start="206.01" dur="6.479">too bad Trump right there is letting</text>
  <text start="210.45" dur="6.17">everyone know that if the Fed does not</text>
  <text start="212.489" dur="8.31">do something guess what they&amp;#39;re to blame</text>
  <text start="216.62" dur="7.479">now we understand that Trump wants the</text>
  <text start="220.799" dur="6.241">rates cut he wants stimulus started</text>
  <text start="224.099" dur="4.591">there&amp;#39;s a reason for this and we know</text>
  <text start="227.04" dur="4.199">that the Fed is getting prepared and</text>
  <text start="228.69" dur="3.35">ready to cut rates they have no other</text>
  <text start="231.239" dur="3.75">choice</text>
  <text start="232.04" dur="4.84">actually the Fed the central banks</text>
  <text start="234.989" dur="5.34">around the world they&amp;#39;ve trapped</text>
  <text start="236.88" dur="6.06">themselves and now there&amp;#39;s no way out</text>
  <text start="240.329" dur="4.801">they have to do what Trump is telling</text>
  <text start="242.94" dur="4.019">them to do why do you think the ECB is</text>
  <text start="245.13" dur="3.96">out there saying hey you know something</text>
  <text start="246.959" dur="3.571">we&amp;#39;re gonna be cutting rates and most</text>
  <text start="249.09" dur="3.45">likely we&amp;#39;re gonna we&amp;#39;re gonna start</text>
  <text start="250.53" dur="4.109">stimulus once again why do you think the</text>
  <text start="252.54" dur="4.71">Fed is out there and why do you think</text>
  <text start="254.639" dur="5.761">they&amp;#39;re gonna be cutting rates most</text>
  <text start="257.25" dur="4.59">likely in the next couple weeks we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="260.4" dur="5.699">going to see the Fed come out and say</text>
  <text start="261.84" dur="7.41">hey we just cut their rates Trump</text>
  <text start="266.099" dur="6.181">tweeted out the following the Fed raised</text>
  <text start="269.25" dur="4.86">way too early and way too much their</text>
  <text start="272.28" dur="3.99">quantitative tightening was another big</text>
  <text start="274.11" dur="4.32">mistake while our country is doing very</text>
  <text start="276.27" dur="3.72">well the potential wealth creation that</text>
  <text start="278.43" dur="4.5">was missed especially when measured</text>
  <text start="279.99" dur="5.399">against our debt is staggering we are</text>
  <text start="282.93" dur="4.2">competing with other countries that know</text>
  <text start="285.389" dur="4.59">how to play the game against the US</text>
  <text start="287.13" dur="5.61">that&amp;#39;s actually why the EU was formed</text>
  <text start="289.979" dur="5.071">and for China until now the US has been</text>
  <text start="292.74" dur="3.819">easy pickins the Fed has made all the</text>
  <text start="295.05" dur="4.329">wrong moves</text>
  <text start="296.559" dur="4.2">a small rate cut is not enough but we</text>
  <text start="299.379" dur="3.75">will win anyway</text>
  <text start="300.759" dur="4.95">now what Trump is trying to say is that</text>
  <text start="303.129" dur="5.16">the Fed right now they&amp;#39;re gonna cut by a</text>
  <text start="305.709" dur="7.26">small amount and he&amp;#39;s saying listen</text>
  <text start="308.289" dur="8.7">other countries are doing exactly what I</text>
  <text start="312.969" dur="7.47">want the Fed to do and the Fed is not</text>
  <text start="316.989" dur="7.89">doing it so if we don&amp;#39;t grow as fast as</text>
  <text start="320.439" dur="6.72">I would like it&amp;#39;s the feds fault and all</text>
  <text start="324.879" dur="6.09">the other countries they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="327.159" dur="6.15">spring ahead now what is happening here</text>
  <text start="330.969" dur="4.76">is Trump is continually letting the</text>
  <text start="333.309" dur="4.29">people know that the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="335.729" dur="3.97">eventually is going to be the problem</text>
  <text start="337.599" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re the ones who are going to</text>
  <text start="339.699" dur="4.2">destroy the economy and the mainstream</text>
  <text start="342.399" dur="5.04">media they&amp;#39;re out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="343.899" dur="5.79">trying to figure out a way and how they</text>
  <text start="347.439" dur="3.51">can play this now this is coming out of</text>
  <text start="349.689" dur="4.71">the New York Post and the headline is</text>
  <text start="350.949" dur="7.62">the Fed is courting disaster by leaving</text>
  <text start="354.399" dur="6.69">interest rates too low now think about</text>
  <text start="358.569" dur="3.9">what is happening in the past and the</text>
  <text start="361.089" dur="3.78">mainstream media knows this the Fed</text>
  <text start="362.469" dur="5.67">knows this because they&amp;#39;re the ones who</text>
  <text start="364.869" dur="4.8">created these recessions they created</text>
  <text start="368.139" dur="3.09">the bubbles then they had the bubbles</text>
  <text start="369.669" dur="4.46">come down and then we entered a</text>
  <text start="371.229" dur="5.43">recession or depression and it was awful</text>
  <text start="374.129" dur="8.44">think about how they did this in the</text>
  <text start="376.659" dur="8.73">past they knew exactly when to stop</text>
  <text start="382.569" dur="5.25">raising rates they raised him and they</text>
  <text start="385.389" dur="5.51">continued to do this until there was a</text>
  <text start="387.819" dur="5.52">tipping point and then at this point</text>
  <text start="390.899" dur="3.04">when nobody was looking nobody was the</text>
  <text start="393.339" dur="4.32">wiser</text>
  <text start="393.939" dur="7.53">they started to drop the rates and that</text>
  <text start="397.659" dur="6.48">was the domino effect we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="401.469" dur="4.98">many many times before we go back to all</text>
  <text start="404.139" dur="5.94">the recessions it&amp;#39;s the same exact</text>
  <text start="406.449" dur="5.37">pattern now what is happening here is</text>
  <text start="410.079" dur="4.97">that the mainstream media is saying</text>
  <text start="411.819" dur="6.44">listen as you can see from the past</text>
  <text start="415.049" dur="5.32">we&amp;#39;ve always had the same exact results</text>
  <text start="418.259" dur="4.45">it&amp;#39;s funny how they didn&amp;#39;t talk about</text>
  <text start="420.369" dur="4.95">this before they&amp;#39;re talking about when</text>
  <text start="422.709" dur="5.401">the Fed raised the rates we always</text>
  <text start="425.319" dur="3.761">entered a recession once we started to</text>
  <text start="428.11" dur="4.45">drop the rates</text>
  <text start="429.08" dur="5.91">the part that they&amp;#39;re missing the part</text>
  <text start="432.56" dur="4.47">that they&amp;#39;re not saying because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="434.99" dur="4.62">hoping that we have this recession</text>
  <text start="437.03" dur="5.22">before the 2020 elections the part that</text>
  <text start="439.61" dur="6.54">they&amp;#39;re missing is that it took like two</text>
  <text start="442.25" dur="6.27">years before that recession hit what we</text>
  <text start="446.15" dur="6.03">saw when the Fed started to drop rates</text>
  <text start="448.52" dur="7.92">we store we still saw the economy chug</text>
  <text start="452.18" dur="6.269">along it gives it a little boost and we</text>
  <text start="456.44" dur="5.21">get this boost and it&amp;#39;s normally a</text>
  <text start="458.449" dur="6.27">two-year period this is why Trump is</text>
  <text start="461.65" dur="5.919">planning this out very very carefully</text>
  <text start="464.719" dur="6.63">think about it it&amp;#39;s about a year until</text>
  <text start="467.569" dur="8.25">elections he wants the Fed to start to</text>
  <text start="471.349" dur="9.201">cut rates now about a year out he knows</text>
  <text start="475.819" dur="9.03">he will have another six to 12 months</text>
  <text start="480.55" dur="6.75">afterwards to start blaming the Fed for</text>
  <text start="484.849" dur="7.43">the entire economic system coming down</text>
  <text start="487.3" dur="8.14">this is the whole entire plan and it is</text>
  <text start="492.279" dur="4.721">working absolutely perfectly</text>
  <text start="495.44" dur="4.44">now the mainstream meeting the deep</text>
  <text start="497" dur="4.08">state they think what is happening here</text>
  <text start="499.88" dur="4.529">is that we&amp;#39;re gonna be heading into a</text>
  <text start="501.08" dur="7.139">recession during 2020 this is not the</text>
  <text start="504.409" dur="6.781">case the more the stock market the</text>
  <text start="508.219" dur="8.01">unemployment numbers GDP numbers are</text>
  <text start="511.19" dur="7.62">going to look amazing once the election</text>
  <text start="516.229" dur="5.94">is over everything will then start to</text>
  <text start="518.81" dur="5.269">fall apart and this is the second part</text>
  <text start="522.169" dur="4.951">of the plan</text>
  <text start="524.079" dur="7.031">most likely we&amp;#39;re going to enter some</text>
  <text start="527.12" dur="6.69">type of currency crisis why do you think</text>
  <text start="531.11" dur="5.849">all these countries are purchasing gold</text>
  <text start="533.81" dur="4.86">why do you think the central banks said</text>
  <text start="536.959" dur="3.721">you know something we don&amp;#39;t need an</text>
  <text start="538.67" dur="3.33">agreement anymore to sell gold cuz we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="540.68" dur="3.87">not gonna do it anymore</text>
  <text start="542" dur="5.88">there&amp;#39;s no reason to do it we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="544.55" dur="6.51">buy gold and hold on to gold there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="547.88" dur="5.37">reason why gold is being brought into</text>
  <text start="551.06" dur="6.719">the pictures as a reason why gold is</text>
  <text start="553.25" dur="7.86">rising now there&amp;#39;s a reason why all of</text>
  <text start="557.779" dur="4.631">this is happening gold is the insurance</text>
  <text start="561.11" dur="4.15">policy</text>
  <text start="562.41" dur="5.37">everything is going to revert back to</text>
  <text start="565.26" dur="5.73">gold because it&amp;#39;s going to expose the</text>
  <text start="567.78" dur="7.77">fiat currency as something that we</text>
  <text start="570.99" dur="7.35">should have never had something that was</text>
  <text start="575.55" dur="7.26">forced upon the people by the central</text>
  <text start="578.34" dur="6.45">bank system and this Fiat system it is</text>
  <text start="582.81" dur="4.59">going to be completely exposed to</text>
  <text start="584.79" dur="5.58">everyone around the world and the</text>
  <text start="587.4" dur="6.51">central bank they&amp;#39;re the ones who are</text>
  <text start="590.37" dur="6.42">going to be blamed for it all and once</text>
  <text start="593.91" dur="5.55">we enter the currency crisis once</text>
  <text start="596.79" dur="4.65">currency starts to drop because</text>
  <text start="599.46" dur="4.11">everyone&amp;#39;s lowering their currency to</text>
  <text start="601.44" dur="4.65">try to keep the system going and as</text>
  <text start="603.57" dur="6.48">rates come down it will be a complete</text>
  <text start="606.09" dur="7.2">and utter disaster gold will be</text>
  <text start="610.05" dur="7.44">introduced Gold doesn&amp;#39;t really have to</text>
  <text start="613.29" dur="7.77">do much except show its shiny face and</text>
  <text start="617.49" dur="6.48">it will destroy the central banks</text>
  <text start="621.06" dur="4.92">because people will see gold as there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="623.97" dur="4.98">the money there&amp;#39;s the insurance policy</text>
  <text start="625.98" dur="6.75">will have certain individuals in place</text>
  <text start="628.95" dur="6.21">to bring in sound money this is all</text>
  <text start="632.73" dur="4.83">planned and the plan is working</text>
  <text start="635.16" dur="5.04">perfectly and we need to remember</text>
  <text start="637.56" dur="5.46">something very very important since</text>
  <text start="640.2" dur="6.42">countries are purchasing gold since</text>
  <text start="643.02" dur="5.73">central banks are purchasing gold every</text>
  <text start="646.62" dur="4.98">single person in the United States</text>
  <text start="648.75" dur="6.3">should have gold should have silver</text>
  <text start="651.6" dur="6.96">should have junk silver that is your</text>
  <text start="655.05" dur="6.68">insurance policy and if you look back</text>
  <text start="658.56" dur="5.97">through history you can see that gold</text>
  <text start="661.73" dur="5.85">well it&amp;#39;s been around for thousands of</text>
  <text start="664.53" dur="7.16">years we&amp;#39;ve been through many many fiat</text>
  <text start="667.58" dur="7">systems and gold has always been there</text>
  <text start="671.69" dur="8.7">everyone always reverts back to gold and</text>
  <text start="674.58" dur="8.13">silver and it&amp;#39;s the insurance policy so</text>
  <text start="680.39" dur="5.05">why don&amp;#39;t we look at the actions of</text>
  <text start="682.71" dur="5.04">countries of central banks and do</text>
  <text start="685.44" dur="4.11">exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
