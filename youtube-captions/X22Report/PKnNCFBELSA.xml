  <text start="64.769" dur="5.611">episode is Syria is slipping through the</text>
  <text start="67.29" dur="4.829">cabal&amp;#39;s fingers let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="70.38" dur="3.779">economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="72.119" dur="3.871">geopolitical news now it looks like</text>
  <text start="74.159" dur="4.081">President Trump just signed an executive</text>
  <text start="75.99" dur="5.19">order deepening the sanctions on</text>
  <text start="78.24" dur="6.12">Venezuela confirming the rumors of a ban</text>
  <text start="81.18" dur="4.799">on trading in Venezuela debt now the US</text>
  <text start="84.36" dur="4.2">government is considering restricting</text>
  <text start="85.979" dur="4.081">trades in Venezuela debt as it seeks to</text>
  <text start="88.56" dur="4.14">punish Maduro</text>
  <text start="90.06" dur="6.93">for undermining the country&amp;#39;s democracy</text>
  <text start="92.7" dur="7.979">and again we can see the push is there</text>
  <text start="96.99" dur="5.73">to put pressure on Venezuela because</text>
  <text start="100.679" dur="4.86">what they really want is a regime change</text>
  <text start="102.72" dur="4.92">now why do they want a regime change in</text>
  <text start="105.539" dur="4.201">Venezuela well we can see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="107.64" dur="5.729">happening out in the Middle East Syria</text>
  <text start="109.74" dur="6.15">Iraq Lebanon it is all slipping through</text>
  <text start="113.369" dur="6.151">the cabal&amp;#39;s fingers and what they really</text>
  <text start="115.89" dur="5.4">want is an oil-producing country they</text>
  <text start="119.52" dur="3.09">had it out in the Middle East they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="121.29" dur="3.39">losing Syria right now</text>
  <text start="122.61" dur="4.77">and it does not look good and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="124.68" dur="6.359">pushing their agenda here we see that US</text>
  <text start="127.38" dur="8.15">taxpayers they spent 50 million dollars</text>
  <text start="131.039" dur="9.091">for luxury cars guns and booze in</text>
  <text start="135.53" dur="7.57">Afghanistan now a foreign company which</text>
  <text start="140.13" dur="5.19">was hired by the US the US government to</text>
  <text start="143.1" dur="5.43">mentor and train Afghan intelligent</text>
  <text start="145.32" dur="6.09">officers billed the United States for 50</text>
  <text start="148.53" dur="5.489">million dollars for like I said luxury</text>
  <text start="151.41" dur="6.449">cars like Porsches Aston Martin and</text>
  <text start="154.019" dur="6.75">Bentley&amp;#39;s they had lucrative salaries</text>
  <text start="157.859" dur="6.271">for the executives and the spouses the</text>
  <text start="160.769" dur="5.761">firm also spent $1,500 on alcohol 42,000</text>
  <text start="164.13" dur="5.01">on automatic weapons and we can see</text>
  <text start="166.53" dur="4.44">right now that in Afghanistan we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="169.14" dur="3.21">having Billy actia I think it&amp;#39;s up to a</text>
  <text start="170.97" dur="4.26">trillion already out in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="172.35" dur="4.109">where they the Pentagon and the rest</text>
  <text start="175.23" dur="3.27">they can&amp;#39;t account for any of this stuff</text>
  <text start="176.459" dur="4.471">they don&amp;#39;t know where it went</text>
  <text start="178.5" dur="4.019">and we could see there had been building</text>
  <text start="180.93" dur="3.54">schools that haven&amp;#39;t been completed they</text>
  <text start="182.519" dur="3.361">bought the wrong uniforms and it looks</text>
  <text start="184.47" dur="5.06">like this money</text>
  <text start="185.88" dur="8.46">is being diverted into different areas</text>
  <text start="189.53" dur="6.37">now like I said the Cabal is losing</text>
  <text start="194.34" dur="4.53">their grip on the Middle East Russia</text>
  <text start="195.9" dur="5.07">right now they&amp;#39;re going to expand their</text>
  <text start="198.87" dur="3.54">economic partnership across the Middle</text>
  <text start="200.97" dur="6.21">East we see Russian Prime Minister</text>
  <text start="202.41" dur="7.59">Dmitry Medvedev well he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="207.18" dur="5.31">discuss investment cooperation with the</text>
  <text start="210" dur="4.62">Lebanese Prime Minister and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="212.49" dur="4.47">looking to make a deal now this is again</text>
  <text start="214.62" dur="5.04">bypassing the United States they want an</text>
  <text start="216.96" dur="3.51">economic partnership so does Iraq so</text>
  <text start="219.66" dur="3.9">does Syria</text>
  <text start="220.47" dur="6">so does Iran and we can see already with</text>
  <text start="223.56" dur="4.59">Egypt and the rest of the Middle Eastern</text>
  <text start="226.47" dur="3.54">countries they&amp;#39;re all same thing with</text>
  <text start="228.15" dur="5.34">Saudi Arabia they&amp;#39;re all moving towards</text>
  <text start="230.01" dur="7.62">Russia and China why because they</text>
  <text start="233.49" dur="7.65">realize the system is coming down they</text>
  <text start="237.63" dur="6.6">realized the dollar will no longer exist</text>
  <text start="241.14" dur="5.52">now remember what happens when all these</text>
  <text start="244.23" dur="5.4">countries stop using the dollar out in</text>
  <text start="246.66" dur="4.98">the Middle East because right now every</text>
  <text start="249.63" dur="5.43">other country needs the dollar to</text>
  <text start="251.64" dur="5.73">purchase the oil if they don&amp;#39;t need the</text>
  <text start="255.06" dur="5.19">dollar to purchase the oil and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="257.37" dur="5.49">selling the oil through maybe the Euro</text>
  <text start="260.25" dur="5.19">maybe through the yuyuan maybe through</text>
  <text start="262.86" dur="5.73">the ruble just like Iran is doing right</text>
  <text start="265.44" dur="4.71">now guess what the countries don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="268.59" dur="5.16">to keep their dollars in reserve</text>
  <text start="270.15" dur="6">remember the central banks has have</text>
  <text start="273.75" dur="5.61">taken inflation and they moved it</text>
  <text start="276.15" dur="4.59">overseas and they used to take these</text>
  <text start="279.36" dur="3.63">dollars that they&amp;#39;re holding in reserves</text>
  <text start="280.74" dur="3.93">and they used to buy the oil and they</text>
  <text start="282.99" dur="3.15">used to go ahead and they used to</text>
  <text start="284.67" dur="3.12">purchase goods from the United States</text>
  <text start="286.14" dur="4.17">but since the United States is not</text>
  <text start="287.79" dur="5.06">producing that much anymore guess what</text>
  <text start="290.31" dur="5.46">it&amp;#39;s just not happening right now</text>
  <text start="292.85" dur="5.61">so these dollars if they don&amp;#39;t need them</text>
  <text start="295.77" dur="5.25">anymore they&amp;#39;re gonna rush back to the</text>
  <text start="298.46" dur="3.73">United States and if they rush back to</text>
  <text start="301.02" dur="3.63">the United States what are we going to</text>
  <text start="302.19" dur="6.51">see well a lot more currency that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="304.65" dur="6.99">actually going to hit the public now</text>
  <text start="308.7" dur="5.49">there&amp;#39;s going to be more currency in the</text>
  <text start="311.64" dur="5.13">public arena which means the value of</text>
  <text start="314.19" dur="4.86">the dollar is going to decrease now the</text>
  <text start="316.77" dur="4.26">central banks they&amp;#39;ve been creating</text>
  <text start="319.05" dur="4.2">currency but they&amp;#39;ve been keeping it in</text>
  <text start="321.03" dur="3.87">housing they&amp;#39;ve been keeping it in the</text>
  <text start="323.25" dur="4.229">stock market they&amp;#39;ve been keeping it in</text>
  <text start="324.9" dur="4.919">the bond market banks they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="327.479" dur="4.981">holding on to it and using it for other</text>
  <text start="329.819" dur="5.97">things this way it didn&amp;#39;t hit the public</text>
  <text start="332.46" dur="6.78">this way we couldn&amp;#39;t see inflation they</text>
  <text start="335.789" dur="6.211">offshored inflation by sending it</text>
  <text start="339.24" dur="4.41">overseas and what we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="342" dur="4.08">eventually and we&amp;#39;re starting to see it</text>
  <text start="343.65" dur="6.419">now this is all going to come back and</text>
  <text start="346.08" dur="7.019">hit the United States and already we see</text>
  <text start="350.069" dur="6.72">countries are pulling away from the</text>
  <text start="353.099" dur="6.78">dollar Russia and Syria right now they</text>
  <text start="356.789" dur="6.03">are creating a joint air defense system</text>
  <text start="359.879" dur="5.671">with the Pansear s units and the S 400</text>
  <text start="362.819" dur="4.47">air defense missile system and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="365.55" dur="4.589">going to be a this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="367.289" dur="5.401">unified air defense system and it has</text>
  <text start="370.139" dur="4.321">been set up by Syria thanks to the</text>
  <text start="372.69" dur="4.68">efforts of the Russian and Syrian</text>
  <text start="374.46" dur="5.4">military experts and pretty much they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="377.37" dur="5.37">going to put this all across the country</text>
  <text start="379.86" dur="6.66">and any anything that tries to enter the</text>
  <text start="382.74" dur="6.45">country it is going to be shot down it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="386.52" dur="4.829">almost like a force field over Syria</text>
  <text start="389.19" dur="4.229">right now so if Israel tries to fly in</text>
  <text start="391.349" dur="5.701">if the United States tries to fly in</text>
  <text start="393.419" dur="5.851">this is going to be very very difficult</text>
  <text start="397.05" dur="4.08">right now they have an agreement where</text>
  <text start="399.27" dur="3.899">these planes can go and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="401.13" dur="4.529">targeted or anything like that this is</text>
  <text start="403.169" dur="6.96">why we had that bombing run that hit the</text>
  <text start="405.659" dur="6.63">Syrian armed forces because Russia knew</text>
  <text start="410.129" dur="3.78">of these planes because they had an</text>
  <text start="412.289" dur="2.94">agreement but they didn&amp;#39;t know that</text>
  <text start="413.909" dur="4.801">these planes were going to hit the</text>
  <text start="415.229" dur="7.47">Syrian armed forces now all these planes</text>
  <text start="418.71" dur="6.419">are being targeted and we&amp;#39;re on a</text>
  <text start="422.699" dur="4.921">different playing field right now we see</text>
  <text start="425.129" dur="5.79">the us back forces they&amp;#39;re preparing a</text>
  <text start="427.62" dur="6.03">major offensive for Syria&amp;#39;s Deir Azur</text>
  <text start="430.919" dur="4.321">and we can see that most likely this is</text>
  <text start="433.65" dur="4.139">not going to go well because Russia has</text>
  <text start="435.24" dur="4.59">been bombing that entire area right now</text>
  <text start="437.789" dur="4.47">Russia their Air Force they have</text>
  <text start="439.83" dur="7.259">destroyed over 1000 terrorist sites in</text>
  <text start="442.259" dur="6.481">Syria this week and according to a</text>
  <text start="447.089" dur="5.251">published paper the Russian aerospace</text>
  <text start="448.74" dur="6.36">forces performed over 360 combat sorties</text>
  <text start="452.34" dur="4.62">the area and we can see they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="455.1" dur="5.22">destroying the Islamic state al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="456.96" dur="5.37">like crazy now Russia is out there and</text>
  <text start="460.32" dur="5.4">they are saying they are not leaving</text>
  <text start="462.33" dur="6.72">Syria until they wipe out all the</text>
  <text start="465.72" dur="6.56">terrorist groups in Syria so the Cabal</text>
  <text start="469.05" dur="7.65">right now they&amp;#39;re in deep deep trouble</text>
  <text start="472.28" dur="7.42">because Russia their mission is to hit</text>
  <text start="476.7" dur="4.95">all the different groups and remove them</text>
  <text start="479.7" dur="4.65">and we can see already they cut off the</text>
  <text start="481.65" dur="5.39">borders they&amp;#39;re stopping the paid</text>
  <text start="484.35" dur="5.28">mercenaries and this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="487.04" dur="5.02">completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="489.63" dur="4.35">the Islamic state they pushed their</text>
  <text start="492.06" dur="5">border offensive on the Lebanese border</text>
  <text start="493.98" dur="6.87">and it was a complete and utter disaster</text>
  <text start="497.06" dur="6.91">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="500.85" dur="6.81">Cabal their grip on the Middle East is</text>
  <text start="503.97" dur="7.23">completely falling apart and we need to</text>
  <text start="507.66" dur="6.75">understand that once this is completely</text>
  <text start="511.2" dur="5.07">done and they have no more power in this</text>
  <text start="514.41" dur="4.5">region and Russia and China start to</text>
  <text start="516.27" dur="5.34">step in which they&amp;#39;re already doing well</text>
  <text start="518.91" dur="5.43">guess what the petro dollar is in</text>
  <text start="521.61" dur="5.94">trouble if Trump and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="524.34" dur="5.04">watch this very carefully if what he</text>
  <text start="527.55" dur="3.63">says he&amp;#39;s going to do in Afghanistan is</text>
  <text start="529.38" dur="4.44">what he&amp;#39;s going to do where he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="531.18" dur="5.52">after the terrace where he&amp;#39;s going after</text>
  <text start="533.82" dur="7.08">the poppy fields if he cuts off the</text>
  <text start="536.7" dur="8.12">funding to the Cabal to the intelligence</text>
  <text start="540.9" dur="8.7">agencies if he does all of these things</text>
  <text start="544.82" dur="7.87">well the Cabal is finished there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="549.6" dur="5.88">nothing else left for them to do except</text>
  <text start="552.69" dur="4.8">maybe some type of gigantic event but we</text>
  <text start="555.48" dur="3.63">can see right now they&amp;#39;re running into</text>
  <text start="557.49" dur="3.48">trouble and I think this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="559.11" dur="3.18">trying to push their agenda here in the</text>
  <text start="560.97" dur="4.04">United States along with George Soros</text>
  <text start="562.29" dur="5.76">where they&amp;#39;re trying to create chaos</text>
  <text start="565.01" dur="5.08">between all the different people here in</text>
  <text start="568.05" dur="4.47">the United States they want some type of</text>
  <text start="570.09" dur="6.3">civil war they want some type of an</text>
  <text start="572.52" dur="6.84">event to happen to occur so they can say</text>
  <text start="576.39" dur="4.23">ah look what&amp;#39;s going on here and they</text>
  <text start="579.36" dur="3.78">can have the corporate media which is</text>
  <text start="580.62" dur="4.92">their mouthpiece they can say see look</text>
  <text start="583.14" dur="3.03">we have a racial divide because we we</text>
  <text start="585.54" dur="2.91">know that the</text>
  <text start="586.17" dur="4.109">uN came out with a warning already and I</text>
  <text start="588.45" dur="4.16">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised because we know</text>
  <text start="590.279" dur="5.331">and Tifa is behind a lot of these things</text>
  <text start="592.61" dur="5.71">because George Soros pays them very well</text>
  <text start="595.61" dur="4.029">that they&amp;#39;re going to try something else</text>
  <text start="598.32" dur="2.88">very very soon</text>
  <text start="599.639" dur="3.831">and they&amp;#39;re gonna try to keep this</text>
  <text start="601.2" dur="4.62">pressure up because what&amp;#39;s happening is</text>
  <text start="603.47" dur="4.72">everything else around the world is</text>
  <text start="605.82" dur="4.759">completely falling apart everything that</text>
  <text start="608.19" dur="4.98">they built up over the many many years</text>
  <text start="610.579" dur="6.221">they just lost it all think about it for</text>
  <text start="613.17" dur="6.33">a second controlling Iraq controlling</text>
  <text start="616.8" dur="4.8">Libya Lebanon Sudan Somalia going into</text>
  <text start="619.5" dur="4.74">Syria than going into Iran that entire</text>
  <text start="621.6" dur="5.429">plan is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="624.24" dur="5.19">starting a war in North Korea has not</text>
  <text start="627.029" dur="5.341">happened as of yet doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="629.43" dur="6.54">going to because I expect them to push</text>
  <text start="632.37" dur="5.969">some type of major event to get us into</text>
  <text start="635.97" dur="4.229">a war hopefully this can be stopped</text>
  <text start="638.339" dur="3.99">this can be stopped before it happens</text>
  <text start="640.199" dur="4.621">but we can see that they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="642.329" dur="4.44">give up and if their backs are against</text>
  <text start="644.82" dur="5.129">the wall and they have no other place to</text>
  <text start="646.769" dur="5.161">go you will see they will come out</text>
  <text start="649.949" dur="4.441">swinging and the corporate media will</text>
  <text start="651.93" dur="4.44">play it up and it will seem like you</text>
  <text start="654.39" dur="5.37">know this just happened naturally this</text>
  <text start="656.37" dur="5.85">is what false flags are so we can see</text>
  <text start="659.76" dur="5.389">here we are in August we&amp;#39;re coming up to</text>
  <text start="662.22" dur="6.39">Labor Day it&amp;#39;s been very very quiet and</text>
  <text start="665.149" dur="5.711">I expecting I&amp;#39;m expecting something big</text>
  <text start="668.61" dur="4.83">to happen within the next two weeks or</text>
  <text start="670.86" dur="4.589">so because I can&amp;#39;t believe that the</text>
  <text start="673.44" dur="3.69">Cabal is just going to lay low let</text>
