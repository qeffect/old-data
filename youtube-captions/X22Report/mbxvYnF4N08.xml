  <text start="73.95" dur="3.87">right into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="75.54" dur="6.149">financial news now throughout the year</text>
  <text start="77.82" dur="9.51">of 2015 the FBI was out there and they</text>
  <text start="81.689" dur="7.11">were using the term war on cops and they</text>
  <text start="87.33" dur="4.95">said it was because of the Ferguson</text>
  <text start="88.799" dur="6.751">effect and the everyday person was out</text>
  <text start="92.28" dur="8.9">there and they were going after police</text>
  <text start="95.55" dur="9.42">officers and very interestingly is that</text>
  <text start="101.18" dur="8.229">according to the bureau according to</text>
  <text start="104.97" dur="7.259">their own records it shows that 41 law</text>
  <text start="109.409" dur="6.511">enforcement officers were killed in the</text>
  <text start="112.229" dur="6.121">line of duty in 2015 this is a decrease</text>
  <text start="115.92" dur="6.18">of almost twenty percent when compared</text>
  <text start="118.35" dur="7.199">with 51 officers killed in 2014 so</text>
  <text start="122.1" dur="6.57">throughout 2015 law enforcement</text>
  <text start="125.549" dur="6.091">officials police unions and even FBI</text>
  <text start="128.67" dur="7.8">director James Comey warned of a war on</text>
  <text start="131.64" dur="6.659">cops and they were saying this was</text>
  <text start="136.47" dur="4.68">because of this outgrowth of the</text>
  <text start="138.299" dur="5.61">Ferguson effect and they were trying to</text>
  <text start="141.15" dur="5.21">convince the entire country that people</text>
  <text start="143.909" dur="5.461">were killing police all over the place</text>
  <text start="146.36" dur="7.15">well it turns out that this is</text>
  <text start="149.37" dur="5.91">completely fake it&amp;#39;s not what they say</text>
  <text start="153.51" dur="6.83">and actually if you look at their</text>
  <text start="155.28" dur="7.74">statistics we see that there were 1,200</text>
  <text start="160.34" dur="3.88">Americans that died in violent</text>
  <text start="163.02" dur="4.71">encounters</text>
  <text start="164.22" dur="5.61">with the police last year so we see</text>
  <text start="167.73" dur="4.02">something very different from what they</text>
  <text start="169.83" dur="5.82">were telling us and again we see this</text>
  <text start="171.75" dur="5.85">happen quite a bit where the FBI these</text>
  <text start="175.65" dur="4.14">agencies they come out they try to push</text>
  <text start="177.6" dur="4.17">propaganda that the police are being</text>
  <text start="179.79" dur="3.99">attacked that the people are coming</text>
  <text start="181.77" dur="4.26">after them well when you look at what</text>
  <text start="183.78" dur="4.5">the police were doing where they were</text>
  <text start="186.03" dur="4.11">using these new techniques where they</text>
  <text start="188.28" dur="3.93">were drawing their weapons shooting</text>
  <text start="190.14" dur="5.22">people for no reason and I remember back</text>
  <text start="192.21" dur="6.57">in time police only drew their weapon if</text>
  <text start="195.36" dur="6.78">a weapon was drawn on them otherwise</text>
  <text start="198.78" dur="7.47">they didn&amp;#39;t do it today it seems like if</text>
  <text start="202.14" dur="6.72">someone flinches your shot and we can</text>
  <text start="206.25" dur="5.01">see from these statistics it does back</text>
  <text start="208.86" dur="4.02">that up where the police are killing</text>
  <text start="211.26" dur="4.17">many more Americans than Americans</text>
  <text start="212.88" dur="6.23">killing police so that war on cops is</text>
  <text start="215.43" dur="7.05">actually fake phony and false once again</text>
  <text start="219.11" dur="5.79">now we understand that the new 2017</text>
  <text start="222.48" dur="5.729">National Defense Authorization Act is</text>
  <text start="224.9" dur="6.55">being pushed through and what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="228.209" dur="5.611">done is they stripped out the draft</text>
  <text start="231.45" dur="4.2">section for women we know a lot of</text>
  <text start="233.82" dur="3.54">people were outraged by this they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="235.65" dur="4.71">want women drafted in the armed forces</text>
  <text start="237.36" dur="5.04">and we have to go back in time a little</text>
  <text start="240.36" dur="5.159">bit here because the Selective Service</text>
  <text start="242.4" dur="6.96">which is completely unconstitutional was</text>
  <text start="245.519" dur="6.991">imposed on Congress in 1917 to raise</text>
  <text start="249.36" dur="7.189">conscripts for World War one and then</text>
  <text start="252.51" dur="8.729">again in 1940 ahead of world war two</text>
  <text start="256.549" dur="7.031">1948 for the Korean War and it was</text>
  <text start="261.239" dur="4.501">brought back by President Carter in 1980</text>
  <text start="263.58" dur="6.78">to warn the Soviet Union over the</text>
  <text start="265.74" dur="6.75">invasion of Afghanistan and we see right</text>
  <text start="270.36" dur="6.27">now that this whole thing was completely</text>
  <text start="272.49" dur="7.38">unconstitutional and people were very</text>
  <text start="276.63" dur="6.539">upset about this whole rider in the end</text>
  <text start="279.87" dur="5.31">a a NDAA of women being drafted now</text>
  <text start="283.169" dur="3.031">everyone&amp;#39;s saying okay women are not</text>
  <text start="285.18" dur="4.489">going to be drafted into the armed</text>
  <text start="286.2" dur="8.089">forces well there&amp;#39;s another bill and</text>
  <text start="289.669" dur="7.06">it&amp;#39;s called draft our daughters act of</text>
  <text start="294.289" dur="7.18">2016</text>
  <text start="296.729" dur="7.381">now it sounds like parents are like okay</text>
  <text start="301.469" dur="4.23">let&amp;#39;s create a bill that&amp;#39;s called draft</text>
  <text start="304.11" dur="5.729">our daughters because it&amp;#39;s a good thing</text>
  <text start="305.699" dur="6.78">to send our children off to war and like</text>
  <text start="309.839" dur="4.711">I said whenever they named a bill it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="312.479" dur="4.62">always the opposite of what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="314.55" dur="4.739">it&amp;#39;s it sounds good but it really isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="317.099" dur="4.53">I mean the Affordable Care Act need i</text>
  <text start="319.289" dur="5.011">say more and what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="321.629" dur="6.9">is they&amp;#39;re trying to force this issue</text>
  <text start="324.3" dur="9.149">they want more Americans to be drafted</text>
  <text start="328.529" dur="8.82">into the armed forces why because we are</text>
  <text start="333.449" dur="7.53">moving towards World War three and they</text>
  <text start="337.349" dur="7.831">need everyone on board this time because</text>
  <text start="340.979" dur="9.84">remember last time the war was fought in</text>
  <text start="345.18" dur="9.919">Europe this time these countries have</text>
  <text start="350.819" dur="8.011">weapons that can reach the United States</text>
  <text start="355.099" dur="5.53">so the United States the physical land</text>
  <text start="358.83" dur="5.28">of the United States will be brought</text>
  <text start="360.629" dur="10.53">into war and this is why they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="364.11" dur="10.649">this so hard now out in Brazil we see</text>
  <text start="371.159" dur="8.22">that the coup d&amp;#39;etat is orchestrated by</text>
  <text start="374.759" dur="8.84">the US so we&amp;#39;ve seen that former vice</text>
  <text start="379.379" dur="6.72">president tammer is going to succeed</text>
  <text start="383.599" dur="5.86">Rousseff and he&amp;#39;s going to head the</text>
  <text start="386.099" dur="7.71">country and remember he&amp;#39;s in u.s.</text>
  <text start="389.459" dur="8.88">embassy informant for Washington we also</text>
  <text start="393.809" dur="7.95">realize that the Senate impeachment</text>
  <text start="398.339" dur="8.91">leader has suspicious ties with the US</text>
  <text start="401.759" dur="8.851">Senator illusio Nunez and he&amp;#39;s part of</text>
  <text start="407.249" dur="6">tamars Brazilian democratic movement who</text>
  <text start="410.61" dur="7.199">led the impeachment in the Senate he</text>
  <text start="413.249" dur="6.241">came to Washington for three days just a</text>
  <text start="417.809" dur="5.19">day afterward to meet with the US</text>
  <text start="419.49" dur="5.489">officials some of the people that knew</text>
  <text start="422.999" dur="4.83">Nia is met with included members of the</text>
  <text start="424.979" dur="4.35">US on Foreign Relations Committee which</text>
  <text start="427.829" dur="3.43">was former Secretary of State Madeleine</text>
  <text start="429.329" dur="7.881">Albright</text>
  <text start="431.259" dur="8.891">Thomas Shannon and among others and what</text>
  <text start="437.21" dur="7.459">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that this was</text>
  <text start="440.15" dur="8.19">completely orchestrated as a coup</text>
  <text start="444.669" dur="6.581">orchestrated by the US and they got</text>
  <text start="448.34" dur="5.1">these corrupt individuals in Brazil to</text>
  <text start="451.25" dur="4.05">go along with this now very</text>
  <text start="453.44" dur="4.65">interestingly the current newest</text>
  <text start="455.3" dur="5.85">ambassador Brazil Liliana ilde she</text>
  <text start="458.09" dur="5.43">served as the ambassador to Paraguay in</text>
  <text start="461.15" dur="5.97">the lead-up to the 2012 coup against</text>
  <text start="463.52" dur="6.929">Lugo who was ousted in a manner similar</text>
  <text start="467.12" dur="4.95">to Rousseff the Ambassador acted with</text>
  <text start="470.449" dur="3.78">great force during the coup that</text>
  <text start="472.07" dur="5.19">happened in Paraguay and she is in</text>
  <text start="474.229" dur="5.011">Brazil doing the same exact thing so</text>
  <text start="477.26" dur="5.1">when we look at the situation here we</text>
  <text start="479.24" dur="7.609">see that yes this was orchestrated by</text>
  <text start="482.36" dur="8.79">the United States to have regime change</text>
  <text start="486.849" dur="5.591">now we see in Venezuela we see Maduro is</text>
  <text start="491.15" dur="4.29">out there and he declared a state of</text>
  <text start="492.44" dur="5.099">emergency we see the same coup occurring</text>
  <text start="495.44" dur="5.009">there we see the opposition controlled</text>
  <text start="497.539" dur="5.961">Congress is urging the country to defy</text>
  <text start="500.449" dur="8.4">the state of emergency and then we have</text>
  <text start="503.5" dur="9.909">this surveillance plane from the US a</text>
  <text start="508.849" dur="7.88">Boeing 707 III century fly over</text>
  <text start="513.409" dur="7.221">Venezuela and the Venezuela military</text>
  <text start="516.729" dur="6.31">detected the illegal entry of this plane</text>
  <text start="520.63" dur="4.06">now this plane is used to support</text>
  <text start="523.039" dur="4.411">communications of armed groups in war</text>
  <text start="524.69" dur="5.22">zones or to prepare actions to disable</text>
  <text start="527.45" dur="7.41">electronic equipment of governments or</text>
  <text start="529.91" dur="6.72">armed forces or the economy and we can</text>
  <text start="534.86" dur="4.59">see that this plane has a radar dish</text>
  <text start="536.63" dur="4.35">known as a rotor dome which revolves</text>
  <text start="539.45" dur="4.65">slowly scanning radio frequencies to</text>
  <text start="540.98" dur="6.359">pick up communications and it just so</text>
  <text start="544.1" dur="6.54">happened that it was there while all</text>
  <text start="547.339" dur="6.531">this is going on in Venezuela where</text>
  <text start="550.64" dur="6.33">they&amp;#39;re having this economic downturn</text>
  <text start="553.87" dur="6.19">where people are rioting where there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="556.97" dur="6.09">state of emergency so you think at this</text>
  <text start="560.06" dur="4.199">point that the u.s. is monitoring the</text>
  <text start="563.06" dur="4.259">situation</text>
  <text start="564.259" dur="5.76">getting ready to go in and do this</text>
  <text start="567.319" dur="5.76">regime change now as we know victoria</text>
  <text start="570.019" dur="6">nuland she is out in russia meeting with</text>
  <text start="573.079" dur="6.06">her counterpart talking about Ukraine</text>
  <text start="576.019" dur="5.16">and Victoria Nuland said that Washington</text>
  <text start="579.139" dur="4.021">will not recognize local elections in</text>
  <text start="581.179" dur="4.37">eastern Ukraine if they are held outside</text>
  <text start="583.16" dur="5.909">the parameters of the Minsk agreement on</text>
  <text start="585.549" dur="6.4">Ukrainian reconciliation and she said</text>
  <text start="589.069" dur="5.91">there needs to be a Ukrainian election</text>
  <text start="591.949" dur="5.79">that meet ukrainian standards and meet</text>
  <text start="594.979" dur="5.22">OSCE standards now of course this is not</text>
  <text start="597.739" dur="5.01">part of the Minsk agreement whatsoever</text>
  <text start="600.199" dur="6.69">this is what she is putting out there</text>
  <text start="602.749" dur="6.9">and she is saying that there can be no</text>
  <text start="606.889" dur="5.4">elections at this point in time because</text>
  <text start="609.649" dur="4.86">it has to meet all the requirements of</text>
  <text start="612.289" dur="4.44">Ukraine now when you read the mints to</text>
  <text start="614.509" dur="4.2">cease fire agreement this is not what it</text>
  <text start="616.729" dur="4.02">says now of course what she&amp;#39;s doing is</text>
  <text start="618.709" dur="3.99">she&amp;#39;s spinning everything and telling</text>
  <text start="620.749" dur="3.601">the world that there&amp;#39;s going to be no</text>
  <text start="622.699" dur="2.76">elections here whatsoever but we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="840.53" dur="9.06">preparing for now we&amp;#39;re getting reports</text>
  <text start="846.59" dur="6.81">and I&amp;#39;m seeing them slowly show up in</text>
  <text start="849.59" dur="7.35">the news feeds and this is coming out of</text>
  <text start="853.4" dur="7.2">Israel and they&amp;#39;re trying to reestablish</text>
  <text start="856.94" dur="6.24">that Assad is using sarin gas now</text>
  <text start="860.6" dur="6">remember sarin gas was removed from his</text>
  <text start="863.18" dur="5.13">country those who were using sarin gas</text>
  <text start="866.6" dur="5.49">was the Free Syrian Army the Islamic</text>
  <text start="868.31" dur="9.32">state al Qaeda the terrorist groups was</text>
  <text start="872.09" dur="10.65">not Assad and the report says that Assad</text>
  <text start="877.63" dur="9.61">for the first time since 2013 is using</text>
  <text start="882.74" dur="7.83">sarin filled bombs on Isis fighters</text>
  <text start="887.24" dur="6.81">outside of Damascus and this is coming</text>
  <text start="890.57" dur="6.9">from a senior is really official this is</text>
  <text start="894.05" dur="8.58">pure propaganda first of all why would</text>
  <text start="897.47" dur="7.86">Assad use a deadly gas in Damascus when</text>
  <text start="902.63" dur="5.42">he&amp;#39;s never used it before when it was</text>
  <text start="905.33" dur="5.94">the Islamic state when it was Al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="908.05" dur="6.01">now of course they can&amp;#39;t say he&amp;#39;s using</text>
  <text start="911.27" dur="4.56">it on their people so they have to say</text>
  <text start="914.06" dur="3.12">that he&amp;#39;s using it on the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="915.83" dur="5.61">which they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="917.18" dur="8.1">everyone is the enemy and this is pure</text>
  <text start="921.44" dur="7.02">propaganda right now they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="925.28" dur="6.93">make it look like he has sarin gas once</text>
  <text start="928.46" dur="7.47">again now let&amp;#39;s go back to when John</text>
  <text start="932.21" dur="7.43">Kerry met with the finance minister in</text>
  <text start="935.93" dur="12.29">Saudi Arabia before he went on to Vienna</text>
  <text start="939.64" dur="12.85">so we see that Saudi Arabia is telling</text>
  <text start="948.22" dur="6.42">Assad he has two choices either he is</text>
  <text start="952.49" dur="5.76">removed from the political process or</text>
  <text start="954.64" dur="7.09">he&amp;#39;ll be removed by force so what</text>
  <text start="958.25" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re saying is step down or we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="961.73" dur="2.7">going to make you step down now remember</text>
  <text start="963.41" dur="4.26">Russia said</text>
  <text start="964.43" dur="6.06">listen it is up to the people to decide</text>
  <text start="967.67" dur="4.97">and the elections were going to be held</text>
  <text start="970.49" dur="4.47">I think it was like 18 months from now</text>

  <text start="974.96" dur="5.85">the Parliament and they voted for his</text>
  <text start="976.82" dur="5.519">party and it was a huge majority of the</text>
  <text start="980.81" dur="4.339">people looking at this and saying okay</text>
  <text start="982.339" dur="7.31">we want Assad Assad invited Russia in</text>
  <text start="985.149" dur="8.051">Assad is liberating towns and villages</text>
  <text start="989.649" dur="7.06">he is a war hero he stuck by his people</text>
  <text start="993.2" dur="8.13">all of these years everything the u.s.</text>
