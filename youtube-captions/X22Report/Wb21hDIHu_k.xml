  <text start="128.35" dur="6">economic collapse financial news now as</text>
  <text start="130.989" dur="4.981">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking the economy here in</text>
  <text start="134.35" dur="3.6">the United States and the global economy</text>
  <text start="135.97" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking other countries and</text>
  <text start="137.95" dur="4.71">how they&amp;#39;re doing we&amp;#39;ve noticed certain</text>
  <text start="140.53" dur="3.81">patterns and we noticed that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="142.66" dur="4.35">seeing the same type of indicators that</text>
  <text start="144.34" dur="5.73">we&amp;#39;ve seen in the past now when we look</text>
  <text start="147.01" dur="5.759">at initial jobless claims we can see</text>
  <text start="150.07" dur="6.24">that this has continually been dropping</text>
  <text start="152.769" dur="6.451">over time and when we look at continuing</text>
  <text start="156.31" dur="6.57">claims we can see now that we&amp;#39;re at the</text>
  <text start="159.22" dur="5.66">point as where we were back in 1974 but</text>
  <text start="162.88" dur="6.15">what we&amp;#39;ve noticed over the time period</text>
  <text start="164.88" dur="6.31">from 1974 moving forward every time the</text>
  <text start="169.03" dur="5.64">initial jobless claims has dropped to</text>
  <text start="171.19" dur="6.18">these low levels we enter a recession</text>
  <text start="174.67" dur="5.28">and this time it has dropped the most</text>
  <text start="177.37" dur="5.19">that we&amp;#39;ve ever seen in our lifetime</text>
  <text start="179.95" dur="5.399">which tells us something&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="182.56" dur="4.79">which is another indicator letting us</text>
  <text start="185.349" dur="5.061">know what is about to have</text>
  <text start="187.35" dur="6.51">in here and we need to understand the</text>
  <text start="190.41" dur="6.78">central banking system has complete</text>
  <text start="193.86" dur="5.82">control over the economy I mean in the</text>
  <text start="197.19" dur="7.77">past they had control but they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="199.68" dur="8.82">learned now how to control every aspect</text>
  <text start="204.96" dur="7.5">of the economy let me put this all into</text>
  <text start="208.5" dur="5.34">perspective in 1970 when we came off the</text>
  <text start="212.46" dur="4.74">gold standard we went onto the petro</text>
  <text start="213.84" dur="5.25">dollar the central banks had the ability</text>
  <text start="217.2" dur="4.05">to create currency and take more control</text>
  <text start="219.09" dur="5.15">of the economy they were able to bring</text>
  <text start="221.25" dur="5.64">it up and bring it down very easily</text>
  <text start="224.24" dur="6.58">sometimes they had trouble keeping the</text>
  <text start="226.89" dur="5.73">economy afloat and they actually had to</text>
  <text start="230.82" dur="4.47">bring the economy or the economy was</text>
  <text start="232.62" dur="7.23">brought down without them actually doing</text>
  <text start="235.29" dur="8.36">it when we hit 2008 they had the ability</text>
  <text start="239.85" dur="10.28">at that point to control the economy but</text>
  <text start="243.65" dur="11.41">after 2008 they took on the ability to</text>
  <text start="250.13" dur="6.88">completely control the economy now you</text>
  <text start="255.06" dur="3.03">you&amp;#39;re probably thinking like what does</text>
  <text start="257.01" dur="3.99">he mean by this</text>
  <text start="258.09" dur="6.89">I thought they had control think about</text>
  <text start="261" dur="7.5">what they were able to get after 2008</text>
  <text start="264.98" dur="6.22">they were able to get a free pass on to</text>
  <text start="268.5" dur="7.11">uh uh on the ability to create as much</text>
  <text start="271.2" dur="6.75">currency as they wanted they also have</text>
  <text start="275.61" dur="7.19">the ability to purchase toxic real</text>
  <text start="277.95" dur="8.19">estate they also have the ability to buy</text>
  <text start="282.8" dur="5.29">stocks in the stock market and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="286.14" dur="4.83">just a Fed it&amp;#39;s the central banks around</text>
  <text start="288.09" dur="6.41">the world so they have the ability right</text>
  <text start="290.97" dur="7.65">now like they&amp;#39;ve never had before and</text>
  <text start="294.5" dur="6.88">with this newfound ability they can keep</text>
  <text start="298.62" dur="6.21">the economy up much much longer in the</text>
  <text start="301.38" dur="5.49">past there were certain times when the</text>
  <text start="304.83" dur="4.4">economy came down without them bringing</text>
  <text start="306.87" dur="5.76">it down because something you know was</text>
  <text start="309.23" dur="5.5">switched on someplace where people like</text>
  <text start="312.63" dur="4.02">okay with just lost confidence and</text>
  <text start="314.73" dur="6.29">people started to realize this and all</text>
  <text start="316.65" dur="4.37">of a sudden the economy came down now</text>
  <text start="321.06" dur="5.91">this can&amp;#39;t happen or maybe it can but</text>
  <text start="324.33" dur="6.62">they have better control over it</text>
  <text start="326.97" dur="9.75">because they have free rein to create</text>
  <text start="330.95" dur="9.939">currency out of thin air to monetize the</text>
  <text start="336.72" dur="7.38">entire system if they need to do so to</text>
  <text start="340.889" dur="6.571">keep the stock market up they now have</text>
  <text start="344.1" dur="5.25">the ability to purchase stocks they have</text>
  <text start="347.46" dur="5.4">the plunder protection team they have</text>
  <text start="349.35" dur="5.61">other countries purchasing stocks even</text>
  <text start="352.86" dur="4.08">if there are no buyers out there they</text>
  <text start="354.96" dur="3.99">can buy it and doesn&amp;#39;t matter if they</text>
  <text start="356.94" dur="5.34">have no no currency I&amp;#39;ll just create</text>
  <text start="358.95" dur="5.34">currency so keep that in mind when we</text>
  <text start="362.28" dur="5.31">talk about the collapse when we talk</text>
  <text start="364.29" dur="7.099">about the economy coming down they can</text>
  <text start="367.59" dur="6.81">keep this up for a longer period of time</text>
  <text start="371.389" dur="5.59">but there will be a period of time where</text>
  <text start="374.4" dur="4.019">everything won&amp;#39;t make sense and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="376.979" dur="4.051">very worried about that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="378.419" dur="4.261">really worried about the world going ok</text>
  <text start="381.03" dur="3.66">this really doesn&amp;#39;t make sense anymore</text>
  <text start="382.68" dur="3.63">because there&amp;#39;s a lot of people out of</text>
  <text start="384.69" dur="3.96">work a lot of stores that are closed</text>
  <text start="386.31" dur="4.05">down the GDP unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="388.65" dur="4.44">nothing is making sense because when we</text>
  <text start="390.36" dur="4.86">look around it it all doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="393.09" dur="3.54">and the dollar is losing value every</text>
  <text start="395.22" dur="3.6">single day we&amp;#39;re creating more and more</text>
  <text start="396.63" dur="5.159">currency people are switching over to</text>
  <text start="398.82" dur="5.64">the petrol yuyuan or not using the</text>
  <text start="401.789" dur="4.681">dollar to trade in oil and things really</text>
  <text start="404.46" dur="5.64">don&amp;#39;t make sense we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="406.47" dur="6.449">all of this and what they keep doing is</text>
  <text start="410.1" dur="5.069">they keep covering it up and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="412.919" dur="6.361">easy for them to do so once you take</text>
  <text start="415.169" dur="5.701">complete control of the system now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="419.28" dur="3.54">looking at all these indicators and</text>
  <text start="420.87" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re just jumping off the chart it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="422.82" dur="4.56">just crazy right now and most of these</text>
  <text start="425.4" dur="4.38">indicators aren&amp;#39;t calling for a</text>
  <text start="427.38" dur="4.23">recession or that we&amp;#39;re already in a</text>
  <text start="429.78" dur="4.83">recession and we&amp;#39;re seeing the same</text>
  <text start="431.61" dur="5.49">exact signals that we saw back in 2008</text>
  <text start="434.61" dur="4.77">where Americans confidence in the system</text>
  <text start="437.1" dur="4.83">you know is way way up there it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="439.38" dur="5.64">17-year highs well we saw this back in</text>
  <text start="441.93" dur="4.92">2008 and it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what the</text>
  <text start="445.02" dur="4.62">American people think because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="446.85" dur="4.77">being lied to and they&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="449.64" dur="5.34">illusion and of course they think</text>
  <text start="451.62" dur="5.55">everything is great but every</text>
  <text start="454.98" dur="4.2">around them could be crashing but if the</text>
  <text start="457.17" dur="3.78">corporate media hides it all the Fed</text>
  <text start="459.18" dur="5.04">hides at all the government hides it all</text>
  <text start="460.95" dur="6.38">nobody really knows until it&amp;#39;s too late</text>
  <text start="464.22" dur="7.1">this is what they like to do Walmart now</text>
  <text start="467.33" dur="6.88">they&amp;#39;re gonna be closing 260 Sam&amp;#39;s Clubs</text>
  <text start="471.32" dur="6.34">they&amp;#39;re gonna be firing thousands on the</text>
  <text start="474.21" dur="6.33">same day now when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="477.66" dur="4.5">know that Sam&amp;#39;s Clubs have about 650</text>
  <text start="480.54" dur="3.75">locations employing more than a hundred</text>
  <text start="482.16" dur="4.2">thousand people and there&amp;#39;s about a</text>
  <text start="484.29" dur="5.4">hundred and seventy-five employees per</text>
  <text start="486.36" dur="5.31">store that&amp;#39;s a lot of people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="489.69" dur="4.49">going to be laying off we also</text>
  <text start="491.67" dur="5.4">understand that IBM right now is</text>
  <text start="494.18" dur="5.83">reassigning 30 percent of the staff in</text>
  <text start="497.07" dur="5.28">its service delivery business and what</text>
  <text start="500.01" dur="4.88">they&amp;#39;re saying is that as they do this</text>
  <text start="502.35" dur="7.14">they&amp;#39;re also going to be cutting around</text>
  <text start="504.89" dur="6.82">10,000 jobs so this number most likely</text>
  <text start="509.49" dur="5.7">will probably go up but we can see right</text>
  <text start="511.71" dur="5.58">now that these this 30% most likely in</text>
  <text start="515.19" dur="4.26">the end they&amp;#39;ll end up losing their jobs</text>
  <text start="517.29" dur="4.05">now again the companies are doing so</text>
  <text start="519.45" dur="4.32">well earnings are so great everything</text>
  <text start="521.34" dur="5.64">looks fantastic why do we see all of</text>
  <text start="523.77" dur="6.23">this happening because we understand</text>
  <text start="526.98" dur="5.94">that all of this is fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="530" dur="5.59">Bank of America put out something that</text>
  <text start="532.92" dur="4.91">says listen there are a couple things</text>
  <text start="535.59" dur="4.47">that can pop the central bank bubble and</text>
  <text start="537.83" dur="4.99">they&amp;#39;re starting to notice that there</text>
  <text start="540.06" dur="5.88">are strange anomalies in the economy and</text>
  <text start="542.82" dur="5.85">they listed for things that could pop</text>
  <text start="545.94" dur="5.1">the bubble one higher than expected</text>
  <text start="548.67" dur="4.62">inflation well we already know that</text>
  <text start="551.04" dur="6.08">inflation is much higher than the Fed is</text>
  <text start="553.29" dur="7.02">reporting number two lack of reflation</text>
  <text start="557.12" dur="5.71">quantitative failure yeah most likely</text>
  <text start="560.31" dur="7.08">number three rising financial stability</text>
  <text start="562.83" dur="7.55">fears number four protectionist politics</text>
  <text start="567.39" dur="6.15">and once again what we&amp;#39;re looking at is</text>
  <text start="570.38" dur="5.17">more and more indicators showing us that</text>
  <text start="573.54" dur="5.01">something is going on here now if we</text>
  <text start="575.55" dur="6.24">look at Barclays US corporate credit</text>
  <text start="578.55" dur="7.27">spreads we noticed we&amp;#39;re at the point</text>
  <text start="581.79" dur="6.28">where we were in 2007</text>
  <text start="585.82" dur="4.68">and we know what happened when we moved</text>
  <text start="588.07" dur="4.53">into 2008 and this is just another</text>
  <text start="590.5" dur="8.37">indicator letting us know that something</text>
  <text start="592.6" dur="9.03">is terribly wrong now marshal swing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="598.87" dur="5.61">been spot-on with all his calls lately</text>
  <text start="601.63" dur="5.91">and if marshal is correct with the</text>
  <text start="604.48" dur="5.97">latest call we have very little time to</text>
  <text start="607.54" dur="5.13">prepare now what he&amp;#39;s saying and what</text>
  <text start="610.45" dur="4.5">he&amp;#39;s noticed is the following and this</text>
  <text start="612.67" dur="4.59">is coming out of silver doctors now he</text>
  <text start="614.95" dur="4.47">said and this is going back in time to</text>
  <text start="617.26" dur="4.83">the beginning of January by the way that</text>
  <text start="619.42" dur="5.46">there&amp;#39;s a war on gold now we know this</text>
  <text start="622.09" dur="5.37">we&amp;#39;ve seen a huge amount of contracts</text>
  <text start="624.88" dur="6.18">being thrown at gold and gold has been</text>
  <text start="627.46" dur="5.28">brought down and he says that yes if you</text>
  <text start="631.06" dur="4.26">notice there was a massive amount of</text>
  <text start="632.74" dur="5.97">contracts expended where the commercials</text>
  <text start="635.32" dur="5.43">made a pointed cone sort of like the tin</text>
  <text start="638.71" dur="4.65">man&amp;#39;s hat with a position reversal flag</text>
  <text start="640.75" dur="5.58">on top he said around 75 thousand</text>
  <text start="643.36" dur="5.49">contracts traded in 90 minutes in gold</text>
  <text start="646.33" dur="4.71">and in that space to the flag top then</text>
  <text start="648.85" dur="4.56">retreated to exactly the price point</text>
  <text start="651.04" dur="5.46">from where they came and he went on to</text>
  <text start="653.41" dur="5.37">say that it looks like we are headed to</text>
  <text start="656.5" dur="5.88">a fake New Year&amp;#39;s full frontal assault</text>
  <text start="658.78" dur="5.25">on silver and somewhat gold as the last</text>
  <text start="662.38" dur="4.86">quarter corporate sales results come in</text>
  <text start="664.03" dur="5.67">to reporting great fake economic news</text>

  <text start="669.7" dur="6.42">and it is always intentional especially</text>
  <text start="672.16" dur="6.15">at option expirations the metals lateral</text>
  <text start="676.12" dur="4.35">movement has all the looks of the same</text>
  <text start="678.31" dur="5.55">old tricks used to create depression in</text>
  <text start="680.47" dur="6.18">small speculators and manage money which</text>
  <text start="683.86" dur="6.18">tarnishes the allure of gold so various</text>

  <text start="696.49" dur="6.87">went on to say that he thinks the date</text>

  <text start="857.88" dur="9.36">he said this on January 26 2017 now if</text>
  <text start="864.24" dur="5.7">we take that date and we do a little bit</text>
  <text start="867.24" dur="6.8">of math we go five hundred and forty</text>
  <text start="869.94" dur="7.829">seven point five days forward</text>
  <text start="874.04" dur="8.44">it looks like he&amp;#39;s talking about July</text>
  <text start="877.769" dur="9.271">27th 2018 but if you use you know each</text>
  <text start="882.48" dur="7.14">month - this is a 30 a 30-day month you</text>
  <text start="887.04" dur="4.83">get 540 days and that gives us a date of</text>
  <text start="889.62" dur="6.18">July 20th but what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="891.87" dur="9.36">about these two dates July 20th and July</text>
  <text start="895.8" dur="11.099">27th is that they are both on a Friday</text>

  <text start="908.76" dur="7.019">globalists they like to push their</text>
  <text start="913.79" dur="5.049">agendas especially when it has to do</text>
  <text start="915.779" dur="4.981">with banking on Fridays because during</text>
  <text start="918.839" dur="4.381">the weekend they can close things down</text>
  <text start="920.76" dur="5.61">people really don&amp;#39;t notice these things</text>
  <text start="923.22" dur="6.69">this happened in Cyprus it happened in</text>
  <text start="926.37" dur="6.45">Greece it happened in India it happened</text>
  <text start="929.91" dur="5.58">in many countries where they closed the</text>

  <text start="935.49" dur="3">little you know something that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="936.779" dur="4.231">reported out in the corporate media and</text>
  <text start="938.49" dur="5.07">they say everything&amp;#39;s fine don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="941.01" dur="4.23">about it ill reopen on Monday and then</text>
  <text start="943.56" dur="3.54">when Monday comes they said oh no we</text>
  <text start="945.24" dur="3.51">have to keep it closed because we still</text>
  <text start="947.1" dur="4.859">have problems it will only be a couple</text>
  <text start="948.75" dur="5.069">more days and this way people are not</text>

  <text start="953.819" dur="6.871">on the weekend and they give it buys</text>
  <text start="956.579" dur="7.861">them time and what he&amp;#39;s saying here is</text>
  <text start="960.69" dur="6.06">that this information was blurted out</text>
  <text start="964.44" dur="5.16">and they always like to tell you when</text>
  <text start="966.75" dur="7.62">things are going to happen 18 months ago</text>
  <text start="969.6" dur="6.87">and here we are coming into 2018 and we</text>
  <text start="974.37" dur="3.719">have to remembers remember the Economist</text>
  <text start="976.47" dur="5.46">magazine when they said things are going</text>
  <text start="978.089" dur="6.261">to be changing in 2018 and here we are</text>

  <text start="987.36" dur="3.779">it&amp;#39;s just very interesting that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="989.519" dur="3.42">pointing this out he&amp;#39;s noticing the</text>
  <text start="991.139" dur="3.841">pattern with gold and silver and if we</text>
  <text start="992.939" dur="2.94">did we didn&amp;#39;t notice and we reported on</text>
  <text start="994.98" dur="3.029">this many times when there were</text>
  <text start="995.879" dur="5.52">thousands upon thousands of contracts</text>
  <text start="998.009" dur="7.2">being thrown at gold you know in the</text>
  <text start="1001.399" dur="7.141">fall of 2017 bringing the price down and</text>
  <text start="1005.209" dur="5.49">we know that China Russia India that</text>
  <text start="1008.54" dur="3.45">they all been you know accumulating a</text>
  <text start="1010.699" dur="3.57">huge amount of gold</text>

  <text start="1019.279" dur="5.87">we know that the walls are closing in</text>
  <text start="1021.649" dur="7.321">around the elite right now and again</text>
  <text start="1025.149" dur="6.221">they want to control everything as it</text>
  <text start="1028.97" dur="5.579">comes down they leave nothing to chance</text>
  <text start="1031.37" dur="6.48">and now they have complete control of</text>
  <text start="1034.549" dur="7.74">the system all they need is something to</text>
  <text start="1037.85" dur="8.01">blame it on that&amp;#39;s it so this could be a</text>
  <text start="1042.289" dur="7.02">possibility that this is the timeframe</text>
  <text start="1045.86" dur="6.96">of when this systems coming down because</text>
  <text start="1049.309" dur="6.271">we know it&amp;#39;s impossible to sustain no</text>
  <text start="1052.82" dur="4.77">matter what we see happening that the</text>
  <text start="1055.58" dur="4.29">debt is going to continually move up</text>
  <text start="1057.59" dur="4.62">twenty trillion twenty five trillion I</text>
  <text start="1059.87" dur="5.429">mean the pattern is there just can&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="1073.25" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s ridiculous and all these indicators</text>
  <text start="1076.82" dur="4.38">that we&amp;#39;ve been saying the entire</text>
  <text start="1078.2" dur="6.05">system&amp;#39;s just ripping itself apart and</text>
  <text start="1081.2" dur="5.04">of course this is all behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="1084.25" dur="3.46">what they want you to see is that</text>
  <text start="1086.24" dur="4.049">everything is great they do this up to</text>
  <text start="1087.71" dur="4.77">the very end and this is why you need to</text>
  <text start="1090.289" dur="5.76">be ready and prepared because they have</text>
  <text start="1092.48" dur="6.26">plans and the plans don&amp;#39;t include you or</text>
  <text start="1096.049" dur="6.211">me or anyone else and includes them and</text>
  <text start="1098.74" dur="5.799">their plans are to restart the system</text>
  <text start="1102.26" dur="4.279">make a lot of money off the crash and</text>
  <text start="1104.539" dur="6.661">who cares what happens to the people</text>
  <text start="1106.539" dur="7.63">this is how they think and we can see</text>
  <text start="1111.2" dur="4.969">there is a rush net right now of who can</text>
  <text start="1114.169" dur="3.251">get there first who can control it and</text>

  <text start="1122.43" dur="3.45">happening right now and this is why</text>
  <text start="1123.51" dur="6.54">Trump has Andrew Jackson hanging in his</text>

  <text start="1137.07" dur="4.02">why you need to be ready and prepared</text>
