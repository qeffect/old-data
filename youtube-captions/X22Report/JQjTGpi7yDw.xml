  <text start="65.54" dur="5.49">this is not about a trade war it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="68.57" dur="5.04">crashing and resetting the economic</text>
  <text start="71.03" dur="4.979">system let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="73.61" dur="5.52">collapse financial news now there&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="76.009" dur="4.86">a battle going on on who&amp;#39;s gonna control</text>
  <text start="79.13" dur="4.29">the narrative as the economy comes down</text>
  <text start="80.869" dur="6.601">and today we can see that Trump was out</text>
  <text start="83.42" dur="6.93">there and he just basically launched a</text>
  <text start="87.47" dur="6.63">missile at the Central Bank at the</text>
  <text start="90.35" dur="7.079">corporate media to let them know no this</text>

  <text start="105.59" dur="5.79">been going on for a very long time I am</text>

  <text start="111.38" dur="4.739">economy falling apart</text>
  <text start="113.09" dur="5.009">because the central bank the deep state</text>
  <text start="116.119" dur="4.56">and those individuals controlling the</text>
  <text start="118.099" dur="6.811">united states since 1913 they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="120.679" dur="6.78">ones who destroyed the economy and you</text>
  <text start="124.91" dur="3.75">can tell that he is pushing this</text>
  <text start="127.459" dur="3.36">narrative right now we&amp;#39;re going to get</text>
  <text start="128.66" dur="5.01">into that a little bit later in this</text>
  <text start="130.819" dur="5.041">report but let&amp;#39;s start off with what is</text>
  <text start="133.67" dur="4.08">happening in the economy and this</text>
  <text start="135.86" dur="4.86">economic system is deteriorating very</text>
  <text start="137.75" dur="6">very quickly it&amp;#39;s accelerating right now</text>
  <text start="140.72" dur="5.94">the housing market is coming down the US</text>
  <text start="143.75" dur="4.83">service sector is slumping we can see</text>
  <text start="146.66" dur="4.32">that everything is starting to fall</text>
  <text start="148.58" dur="6.21">apart very very rapidly now if we look</text>
  <text start="150.98" dur="6.06">out in Toronto we see prices of detached</text>
  <text start="154.79" dur="4.32">houses they have plunged by two hundred</text>
  <text start="157.04" dur="5.669">and seven thousand from a year ago and</text>
  <text start="159.11" dur="7.17">sales they are collapsing right now and</text>
  <text start="162.709" dur="5.761">if we go back like 18 years ago we can</text>
  <text start="166.28" dur="4.38">see that the Toronto housing market</text>
  <text start="168.47" dur="4.17">continually moved up and up and up</text>
  <text start="170.66" dur="4.14">actually barely dipped during the</text>
  <text start="172.64" dur="3.9">financial crisis and what are we seeing</text>
  <text start="174.8" dur="3.689">today well we&amp;#39;re starting to see the</text>
  <text start="176.54" dur="3.839">whole thing start to fall apart home</text>
  <text start="178.489" dur="4.441">sales in the Greater Toronto Area</text>
  <text start="180.379" dur="4.261">plunged by thirty nine point five</text>
  <text start="182.93" dur="3.78">percent in March compared to a year ago</text>
  <text start="184.64" dur="5.15">and we see that detached</text>
  <text start="186.71" dur="6.48">as they plunge by negative 46.3%</text>
  <text start="189.79" dur="7.96">semi-detached houses plunge by negative</text>
  <text start="193.19" dur="6.51">30.6% townhouses negative 34.2% condos</text>
  <text start="197.75" dur="5.07">negative 32.7%</text>
  <text start="199.7" dur="6.21">and new listings of homes for sale down</text>
  <text start="202.82" dur="7.05">twelve point four percent from a year</text>
  <text start="205.91" dur="7.02">ago and this is spreading we talked</text>
  <text start="209.87" dur="6.15">about the New York economy the New York</text>
  <text start="212.93" dur="5.88">real estate economy and it&amp;#39;s all falling</text>
  <text start="216.02" dur="5.64">apart real estate sales and Manhattan</text>
  <text start="218.81" dur="5.58">plunged by twenty five percent in the</text>
  <text start="221.66" dur="4.14">first quarter from a year ago sales in</text>
  <text start="224.39" dur="3.69">the first quarter post of the largest</text>
  <text start="225.8" dur="4.14">drop in nearly a decade and reached</text>
  <text start="228.08" dur="4.89">their lowest level in more than six</text>
  <text start="229.94" dur="4.8">years there were two thousand 180 sales</text>
  <text start="232.97" dur="3.48">in the first quarter compared with two</text>
  <text start="234.74" dur="4.17">thousand eight hundred ninety two last</text>
  <text start="236.45" dur="5.34">year the high end of the market is</text>
  <text start="238.91" dur="5.19">getting hit the hardest because nobody</text>
  <text start="241.79" dur="4.8">is lowering their prices they&amp;#39;re keeping</text>
  <text start="244.1" dur="3.75">them pretty much where they are and the</text>
  <text start="246.59" dur="3.54">reason they&amp;#39;re doing this is because</text>
  <text start="247.85" dur="5.06">they don&amp;#39;t feel they need to lower the</text>
  <text start="250.13" dur="6.57">prices just yet we saw this happen</text>
  <text start="252.91" dur="6.01">during the 2008 crisis prior to this</text>
  <text start="256.7" dur="2.64">where the housing market started to fall</text>
  <text start="258.92" dur="2.58">apart</text>
  <text start="259.34" dur="3.42">and people didn&amp;#39;t understand what was</text>
  <text start="261.5" dur="3.06">going on so they didn&amp;#39;t lower the</text>
  <text start="262.76" dur="3.54">housing prices because they were being</text>
  <text start="264.56" dur="3.75">told that everything is fine real estate</text>
  <text start="266.3" dur="3.24">doesn&amp;#39;t go down and everyone kept the</text>
  <text start="268.31" dur="3.9">real estate prices to where they were</text>
  <text start="269.54" dur="5.25">and then they come to find out later on</text>
  <text start="272.21" dur="3.93">that they needed to lower their rates</text>
  <text start="274.79" dur="3.18">because the real estate market was</text>
  <text start="276.14" dur="4.17">falling apart and basically everyone was</text>
  <text start="277.97" dur="4.65">trying to catch the market at this point</text>
  <text start="280.31" dur="4.17">where the prices were coming down so</text>
  <text start="282.62" dur="3.87">quickly they would lower their price by</text>
  <text start="284.48" dur="3.72">ten thousand but the market came down by</text>
  <text start="286.49" dur="3.72">twenty thousand and they never could</text>
  <text start="288.2" dur="4.14">catch the market this is why a lot of</text>
  <text start="290.21" dur="4.68">people had a very difficult time trying</text>
  <text start="292.34" dur="4.8">to sell their homes now there is a map</text>
  <text start="294.89" dur="4.8">which is the real estate doomsday map</text>
  <text start="297.14" dur="4.77">and it covers the entire United States</text>
  <text start="299.69" dur="5.48">and there&amp;#39;s different portions of it</text>
  <text start="301.91" dur="6.93">where there&amp;#39;s distressed at risk</text>
  <text start="305.17" dur="6.73">mid-tier comfortable and prosperous now</text>
  <text start="308.84" dur="7.14">looking at this map we can see most of</text>
  <text start="311.9" dur="7.019">the Northeast the mid centralized East</text>
  <text start="315.98" dur="4.32">the south east well it looks like</text>
  <text start="318.919" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re either at risk</text>
  <text start="320.3" dur="5.579">or distressed moving out to the Midwest</text>
  <text start="322.699" dur="6.271">same thing at-risk distressed I would</text>
  <text start="325.879" dur="5.811">say eighty-five to ninety percent of the</text>
  <text start="328.97" dur="6.659">country right now is at risk or</text>
  <text start="331.69" dur="7.81">distressed and mid-tier which means that</text>
  <text start="335.629" dur="6.901">since 2008 nothing has been solved the</text>
  <text start="339.5" dur="5.58">people who own their homes they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="342.53" dur="5.819">underwater they&amp;#39;re still having problems</text>
  <text start="345.08" dur="6.299">nothing has been fixed as of yet now</text>
  <text start="348.349" dur="6.241">what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is a system that</text>
  <text start="351.379" dur="6.951">is breaking down right in front of our</text>
  <text start="354.59" dur="8.009">eyes everything they did in 2008 was a</text>
  <text start="358.33" dur="6.339">gigantic illusion by manipulating pretty</text>
  <text start="362.599" dur="4.56">much everything they manipulated the</text>
  <text start="364.669" dur="4.59">housing market by creating bubbles in 20</text>
  <text start="367.159" dur="4.98">different cities they manipulated the</text>
  <text start="369.259" dur="4.321">unemployment rate they manipulated the</text>
  <text start="372.139" dur="3.391">stock market which they&amp;#39;re still doing</text>
  <text start="373.58" dur="3.869">they manipulated the precious metals</text>
  <text start="375.53" dur="3.9">market they manipulated the GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="377.449" dur="3.93">they manipulated every statistical</text>
  <text start="379.43" dur="4.859">number you can think of they manipulated</text>
  <text start="381.379" dur="6.211">it and what was happening was as we can</text>
  <text start="384.289" dur="4.981">see with our own eyes is that the entire</text>
  <text start="387.59" dur="4.29">economic system has been breaking down</text>
  <text start="389.27" dur="5.82">one piece at a time now going back many</text>
  <text start="391.88" dur="6.18">years we said the the retail industry</text>
  <text start="395.09" dur="5.31">would rip itself apart and it slowly</text>
  <text start="398.06" dur="3.84">happened now of course they changed the</text>
  <text start="400.4" dur="3.269">story first they said oh wreath Hills</text>
  <text start="401.9" dur="3.78">not doing well because of the snow the</text>
  <text start="403.669" dur="4.59">bad weather they started out with that</text>
  <text start="405.68" dur="4.56">but then what happened was retail was</text>
  <text start="408.259" dur="3.991">doing poorly during the nice weather and</text>
  <text start="410.24" dur="3.479">they didn&amp;#39;t know what else to say so</text>
  <text start="412.25" dur="3.479">then they started to say hey you know</text>
  <text start="413.719" dur="4.861">what we can use the story that online is</text>
  <text start="415.729" dur="4.921">really having an effect on you know</text>
  <text start="418.58" dur="4.139">what&amp;#39;s going on in the retail market now</text>
  <text start="420.65" dur="4.979">they couldn&amp;#39;t explain away things like</text>
  <text start="422.719" dur="4.711">food and things like that so they just</text>
  <text start="425.629" dur="3.181">pretended that didn&amp;#39;t exist and they</text>
  <text start="427.43" dur="3.479">just said yeah everything&amp;#39;s moving to</text>
  <text start="428.81" dur="3.96">online of course they look at the actual</text>
  <text start="430.909" dur="4.32">numbers to see how many sales there were</text>
  <text start="432.77" dur="4.32">online compared in the per compared to</text>
  <text start="435.229" dur="3.3">the brick-and-mortar stores and you can</text>
  <text start="437.09" dur="4.169">see this is a very very big difference</text>
  <text start="438.529" dur="4.651">everything is not moving as a 1:1 ratio</text>
  <text start="441.259" dur="3.931">and of course then they blamed it on</text>
  <text start="443.18" dur="4.169">Amazon they built Amazon up very very</text>
  <text start="445.19" dur="5.099">big to make it seem like everyone is</text>
  <text start="447.349" dur="6.12">shopping at Amazon that nobody else has</text>
  <text start="450.289" dur="3.951">an online presence everyone is just</text>
  <text start="453.469" dur="3.561">going to am</text>
  <text start="454.24" dur="6.03">which is not true and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="457.03" dur="6.33">right now is the retail market has</text>
  <text start="460.27" dur="6.869">imploded and what&amp;#39;s going on here is</text>
  <text start="463.36" dur="6.66">that every other piece of the economic</text>
  <text start="467.139" dur="4.801">structure is imploding right now and as</text>
  <text start="470.02" dur="4.739">we move forward it&amp;#39;s just going to get</text>
  <text start="471.94" dur="5.28">worse now this brings us to what Trump</text>
  <text start="474.759" dur="4.741">has said out in the corporate media</text>
  <text start="477.22" dur="4.979">saying that we are not in a trade war</text>
  <text start="479.5" dur="7.349">with China that war was lost many years</text>
  <text start="482.199" dur="6.511">ago now remember the economy is dead the</text>
  <text start="486.849" dur="4.35">economy cannot be revived it cannot be</text>
  <text start="488.71" dur="4.829">resuscitated it&amp;#39;s dead in the water</text>
  <text start="491.199" dur="4.44">the central bankers know it Trump knows</text>
  <text start="493.539" dur="4.41">it the individuals and the</text>
  <text start="495.639" dur="4.321">administration know it and we can see</text>
  <text start="497.949" dur="4.801">what is happening right now everything</text>
  <text start="499.96" dur="5.22">is falling apart and he&amp;#39;s trying to tell</text>
  <text start="502.75" dur="7.74">everyone that listen this is not my</text>
  <text start="505.18" dur="8.669">doing we lost the war with China a long</text>
  <text start="510.49" dur="6.57">time ago and he&amp;#39;s going to expand on</text>
  <text start="513.849" dur="7.081">this why did we lose this war who is to</text>
  <text start="517.06" dur="6.719">blame who put us in this situation</text>
  <text start="520.93" dur="5.49">you&amp;#39;re gonna start to hear a lot of this</text>
  <text start="523.779" dur="5.071">information come out because he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="526.42" dur="3.9">to start to build the narrative and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="528.85" dur="4.29">going to say because of what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="530.32" dur="5.009">done we need to be put back on an even</text>
  <text start="533.14" dur="2.88">playing field but of course it&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="535.329" dur="3.031">late already</text>
  <text start="536.02" dur="5.67">what he&amp;#39;s really doing is preparing us</text>
  <text start="538.36" dur="6">for a reset the economic system needs to</text>
  <text start="541.69" dur="5.58">be brought down it needs to be reset it</text>
  <text start="544.36" dur="5.58">needs to be done this way to wipe out</text>
  <text start="547.27" dur="4.62">the central banking system to destroy</text>
  <text start="549.94" dur="5.07">them that&amp;#39;s the only way you can get rid</text>
  <text start="551.89" dur="6.36">of them remember they&amp;#39;re embedded in the</text>
  <text start="555.01" dur="5.97">system for over a hundred something</text>
  <text start="558.25" dur="4.05">years and it&amp;#39;s not that easy to get rid</text>
  <text start="560.98" dur="2.13">of them you just can&amp;#39;t say hey let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="562.3" dur="3.21">just get rid of them</text>
  <text start="563.11" dur="5.37">because most of the government officials</text>
  <text start="565.51" dur="4.71">will not go along with it so you need to</text>
  <text start="568.48" dur="4.109">start to build a case now the central</text>
  <text start="570.22" dur="4.35">bankers they are doing the same exact</text>
  <text start="572.589" dur="4.771">thing they&amp;#39;re gonna try to bring this</text>
  <text start="574.57" dur="4.86">down and basically control the narrative</text>
  <text start="577.36" dur="4.349">try to control the narrative and blame</text>
  <text start="579.43" dur="4.62">it on Trump this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="581.709" dur="5.291">right now and we could see that the</text>
  <text start="584.05" dur="6.37">tariffs the reciprocal taxes</text>
  <text start="587" dur="5.97">the attack on the tech stocks this is</text>
  <text start="590.42" dur="5.07">all part of the plan to bring this</text>
  <text start="592.97" dur="5.37">system down and this is just gonna get</text>
  <text start="595.49" dur="4.17">worse as time goes on now if we throw in</text>
  <text start="598.34" dur="2.97">what is happening out in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="599.66" dur="4.8">which we&amp;#39;re gonna discuss in a little</text>
  <text start="601.31" dur="4.77">while in the next report report be what</text>
  <text start="604.46" dur="5.04">is happening in the Middle East is the</text>
  <text start="606.08" dur="5.34">next phase to all of this where Trump is</text>
  <text start="609.5" dur="4.71">going to bring the troops home and what</text>
  <text start="611.42" dur="5.64">this is going to do is this is going to</text>
  <text start="614.21" dur="5.88">wreak havoc in the Middle East on the</text>
  <text start="617.06" dur="4.83">petro dollar and once this happens I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="620.09" dur="4.05">not talking about the next day in the</text>
  <text start="621.89" dur="5.04">next month or two we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="624.14" dur="4.26">things really ramped up and I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="626.93" dur="2.31">once this happens we&amp;#39;re gonna see in the</text>
  <text start="628.4" dur="5.01">next couple of months</text>
  <text start="629.24" dur="6.87">this plan is to hit the central bank the</text>
  <text start="633.41" dur="5.67">deep state from all sides to make sure</text>
  <text start="636.11" dur="5.76">all bases are covered this is what we</text>
  <text start="639.08" dur="6.54">are seeing right now and the race is on</text>
  <text start="641.87" dur="6.21">and we can see right now Trump needs to</text>
  <text start="645.62" dur="5.52">control the narrative so when we move to</text>
  <text start="648.08" dur="5.19">the next phase which is maybe auditing</text>
  <text start="651.14" dur="4.17">the Fed maybe pushing through one of</text>
  <text start="653.27" dur="4.11">those bills where the dollar is now</text>
  <text start="655.31" dur="4.44">linked to gold maybe won&amp;#39;t even be</text>
  <text start="657.38" dur="5.1">called the dollar at this point but he</text>
