  <text start="79.42" dur="7.19">program that will basically work with</text>

  <text start="105.7" dur="6.98">all starting to feel the pain of this</text>
  <text start="108.85" dur="7.98">global slowdown of this economic</text>
  <text start="112.68" dur="7.84">collapse of the entire system we see</text>
  <text start="116.83" dur="6.06">Canada just maybe two years ago was like</text>
  <text start="120.52" dur="5.58">the poster child of look how great</text>
  <text start="122.89" dur="5.879">everything is Canada is booming look at</text>
  <text start="126.1" dur="5.46">the real estate it&amp;#39;s fantastic Australia</text>
  <text start="128.769" dur="4.591">incredible very low unemployment until</text>
  <text start="131.56" dur="5.01">we figured out that they fix the numbers</text>
  <text start="133.36" dur="4.68">just like the u.s. does but now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="136.57" dur="4.65">getting more information coming out of</text>
  <text start="138.04" dur="7.89">Australia that things are not as good as</text>
  <text start="141.22" dur="7.29">they seem we&amp;#39;re starting to see that in</text>
  <text start="145.93" dur="4.339">Australia which by the way has the</text>
  <text start="148.51" dur="4.71">highest household debt in the world</text>
  <text start="150.269" dur="7.481">homes are so expensive that nearly half</text>
  <text start="153.22" dur="8.45">of all voyages our interests only well</text>
  <text start="157.75" dur="3.92">this is going to be a problem</text>
  <text start="162.11" dur="5.27">and the reason why is because they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="164.54" dur="6.69">been bringing people in to the mortgage</text>
  <text start="167.38" dur="6.49">arena with loosey-goosey lending terms</text>
  <text start="171.23" dur="4.62">now we&amp;#39;ve seen this here in the United</text>
  <text start="173.87" dur="5.28">States and they&amp;#39;re doing the same thing</text>
  <text start="175.85" dur="7.95">in Australia and this is a red flag for</text>
  <text start="179.15" dur="6.71">imminent disaster Jonathan temper CEO at</text>
  <text start="183.8" dur="4.35">the research firm variant perception</text>
  <text start="185.86" dur="6.37">he&amp;#39;s saying it&amp;#39;s not a question of if</text>
  <text start="188.15" dur="6.54">but when they have a mortgage crisis in</text>
  <text start="192.23" dur="4.86">Australia it&amp;#39;s going to be horrific this</text>
  <text start="194.69" dur="7.25">is the guy who predicted the mortgage</text>
  <text start="197.09" dur="7.34">meltdown in the US Ireland and Spain and</text>
  <text start="201.94" dur="4.84">he said the one word that best describes</text>
  <text start="204.43" dur="5.5">Australian housing market is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="206.78" dur="7.53">completely insane and there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="209.93" dur="6.09">be major problems down the road he said</text>
  <text start="214.31" dur="3.81">the flood of interest only mortgages</text>
  <text start="216.02" dur="6.719">with sky-high price to income ratios is</text>
  <text start="218.12" dur="6.99">a sign of a Ponzi financing and now</text>
  <text start="222.739" dur="5.151">banks are heavily exposed to these</text>
  <text start="225.11" dur="5.48">mortgages and any downturn in prices</text>
  <text start="227.89" dur="5.26">it&amp;#39;s going to be a complete disaster and</text>
  <text start="230.59" dur="5.86">they&amp;#39;re already estimating and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="233.15" dur="7.08">already seeing a downturn in prices</text>
  <text start="236.45" dur="6.33">they&amp;#39;re expecting next year or later in</text>
  <text start="240.23" dur="6.75">this year that prices are going to</text>
  <text start="242.78" dur="5.82">plunge by twenty-five percent so those</text>
  <text start="246.98" dur="3.99">people who are out there now in</text>
  <text start="248.6" dur="6.93">Australia thinking that everything is</text>
  <text start="250.97" dur="6.66">fine the domino effect will occur and it</text>
  <text start="255.53" dur="4.53">will hit each city and things will come</text>
  <text start="257.63" dur="4.47">down very very quickly and like I said</text>
  <text start="260.06" dur="3.99">these things seem to spread very quickly</text>
  <text start="262.1" dur="4.08">look what happened in the housing crisis</text>
  <text start="264.05" dur="5.01">back in two thousand eight one day</text>
  <text start="266.18" dur="4.89">everything was fine central bankers were</text>
  <text start="269.06" dur="4.109">telling us it&amp;#39;s fine governments were</text>
  <text start="271.07" dur="5.55">telling us it&amp;#39;s fine and the whole thing</text>
  <text start="273.169" dur="6.511">fell apart in a matter of months and it</text>
  <text start="276.62" dur="4.799">spread very quickly to all parts of the</text>
  <text start="279.68" dur="4.02">United States it happened in cata to</text>
  <text start="281.419" dur="4.761">happen in Europe it was a complete and</text>
  <text start="283.7" dur="6.42">utter disaster here in the United States</text>
  <text start="286.18" dur="8.5">well hope has collapsed now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="290.12" dur="5.37">interesting we have two different boards</text>
  <text start="294.68" dur="5.489">that</text>
  <text start="295.49" dur="7.37">or surveys that record consumer</text>
  <text start="300.169" dur="6.78">confidence we have the conference board</text>
  <text start="302.86" dur="8.02">consumer confidence which is supported</text>
  <text start="306.949" dur="5.431">by the government which is in line with</text>
  <text start="310.88" dur="3.65">the government then we have a Gallup</text>
  <text start="312.38" dur="4.2">poll which is the people poll of</text>
  <text start="314.53" dur="3.78">consumer confidence but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="316.58" dur="7.019">interesting is the conference board</text>
  <text start="318.31" dur="10.829">consumer confidence well that number has</text>
  <text start="323.599" dur="8.731">now dropped it went from 98 97.8 to 92.2</text>
  <text start="329.139" dur="6.581">this is the weakest since july of 2015</text>
  <text start="332.33" dur="7.98">now the Gallup poll is much much lower</text>
  <text start="335.72" dur="7.91">than this and we see that consumer</text>
  <text start="340.31" dur="6.329">confidence is contracting right now</text>
  <text start="343.63" dur="6.759">because think about this why would</text>
  <text start="346.639" dur="5.791">consumers why would they lose hope at</text>
  <text start="350.389" dur="4.741">this point why wouldn&amp;#39;t they be</text>
  <text start="352.43" dur="5.28">confident in the economy because if you</text>
  <text start="355.13" dur="5.46">really think about it we have very low</text>
  <text start="357.71" dur="5.19">gas prices the government is telling us</text>
  <text start="360.59" dur="6.44">how great unemployment is it&amp;#39;s down four</text>
  <text start="362.9" dur="11.22">point nine percent the stock market is</text>
  <text start="367.03" dur="10.81">pretty much at all-time highs so why in</text>
  <text start="374.12" dur="8.28">the world are people nervous because</text>
  <text start="377.84" dur="6.27">they know in their gut they know that</text>
  <text start="382.4" dur="2.84">something&amp;#39;s wrong especially those</text>
  <text start="384.11" dur="3.059">people that are getting laid off</text>
  <text start="385.24" dur="6.19">especially those people that never</text>
  <text start="387.169" dur="5.28">founded on the job especially those</text>
  <text start="391.43" dur="3.359">people who are working two three</text>
  <text start="392.449" dur="5.041">part-time jobs because they can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="394.789" dur="5.521">the job so we&amp;#39;re seeing consumer</text>
  <text start="397.49" dur="7.649">confidence is hovering near a three-year</text>
  <text start="400.31" dur="8.22">low right now and at this point we see</text>
  <text start="405.139" dur="6.21">one in four Americans they&amp;#39;re on the</text>
  <text start="408.53" dur="5.699">verge of financial ruin this is coming</text>
  <text start="411.349" dur="5.04">from bankrate.com of more than a</text>
  <text start="414.229" dur="4.921">thousand adults which were surveyed</text>
  <text start="416.389" dur="4.861">nearly one in four Americans have credit</text>
  <text start="419.15" dur="7.379">card debt that exceeds their emergency</text>
  <text start="421.25" dur="7.86">fund or savings and many people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="426.529" dur="6.301">have any savings at all</text>
  <text start="429.11" dur="8.39">many people don&amp;#39;t have jobs which allow</text>
  <text start="432.83" dur="9.3">them to make it through each month and</text>
  <text start="437.5" dur="6.7">we see right now that this is a huge</text>
  <text start="442.13" dur="6.93">problem because one little hiccup in the</text>
  <text start="444.2" dur="11.07">system these people are in complete</text>
  <text start="449.06" dur="8.19">disaster and everyone it looks like one</text>
  <text start="455.27" dur="4.08">in four Americans i should say they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="457.25" dur="5.76">teetering on the edge of financial</text>
  <text start="459.35" dur="9.21">disaster they&amp;#39;re in their own economic</text>
  <text start="463.01" dur="7.44">collapse and this is going to spread to</text>
  <text start="468.56" dur="4.11">more and more people as time goes on</text>
  <text start="470.45" dur="5.66">because we&amp;#39;re seeing layoffs pick up</text>
  <text start="472.67" dur="6.48">we&amp;#39;re not seeing them slow down and</text>
  <text start="476.11" dur="6.1">we&amp;#39;re starting to see the restaurant</text>
  <text start="479.15" dur="4.77">industry it&amp;#39;s declining so they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="482.21" dur="4.62">going to be hiring waiters waitresses</text>
  <text start="483.92" dur="5.55">bartenders the foot traffic in these</text>
  <text start="486.83" dur="7.01">places are starting to slow retail is</text>
  <text start="489.47" dur="7.95">continually laying off closing up shop</text>
  <text start="493.84" dur="8.34">so where is everyone going to find these</text>
  <text start="497.42" dur="8.73">jobs it&amp;#39;s going to get harder and harder</text>
  <text start="502.18" dur="7.54">now we see existing home sales all of a</text>
  <text start="506.15" dur="5.28">sudden skyrocketed in January where</text>
  <text start="509.72" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re like oh my God look at this home</text>
  <text start="511.43" dur="4.32">sales are doing perfectly well once</text>
  <text start="513.74" dur="4.29">again but then we have to look a little</text>
  <text start="515.75" dur="5.28">bit closer at what&amp;#39;s been really going</text>
  <text start="518.03" dur="5.01">on and guess what it is not the American</text>
  <text start="521.03" dur="5.91">people it&amp;#39;s coming from hedge funds</text>
  <text start="523.04" dur="5.61">investments and foreign investors now</text>
  <text start="526.94" dur="3.99">remember the stock market had dropped</text>
  <text start="528.65" dur="3.63">quite a bit people got nervous they took</text>
  <text start="530.93" dur="5.28">the money out of the stock market and</text>
  <text start="532.28" dur="8.07">they started placing that money in other</text>
  <text start="536.21" dur="6.81">places gold real estate and many other</text>
  <text start="540.35" dur="5.88">areas and most likely this is why we</text>
  <text start="543.02" dur="7.95">seen a surge but we&amp;#39;re not seeing a</text>
  <text start="546.23" dur="8.07">surge from the everyday American because</text>
  <text start="550.97" dur="5.31">right now those people especially those</text>
  <text start="554.3" dur="6.83">people coming out of college they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="556.28" dur="4.85">find jobs they have too much debt</text>
  <text start="562.12" dur="4.8">and at this point they can&amp;#39;t save any</text>
  <text start="564.25" dur="4.47">money but it&amp;#39;s very interesting and</text>
  <text start="566.92" dur="5.16">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about this for quite</text>
  <text start="568.72" dur="4.92">a while we&amp;#39;ve been talking about housing</text>
  <text start="572.08" dur="4.949">prices and I looked around the country</text>
  <text start="573.64" dur="7.38">today and I see many houses many houses</text>
  <text start="577.029" dur="7.051">on the market they&amp;#39;re not selling the</text>
  <text start="581.02" dur="5.28">prices are coming down and many people</text>
  <text start="584.08" dur="4.74">right into me saying well my area</text>
  <text start="586.3" dur="4.83">everything is fine house prices are</text>
  <text start="588.82" dur="5.07">going up we don&amp;#39;t see the housing prices</text>
  <text start="591.13" dur="5.61">coming down look even the corporate</text>
  <text start="593.89" dur="4.35">media case-shiller they&amp;#39;re showing us</text>
  <text start="596.74" dur="3.45">that housing prices are continually</text>
  <text start="598.24" dur="5.28">rising well remember there are always</text>
  <text start="600.19" dur="5.88">three to four months behind what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="603.52" dur="5.79">really going on I&amp;#39;m looking at things</text>
  <text start="606.07" dur="6.18">real time today and it takes a little</text>
  <text start="609.31" dur="7.14">while for them to catch up because</text>
  <text start="612.25" dur="8.39">already we see case-shiller finally</text>
  <text start="616.45" dur="7.62">saying in December actually starting in</text>
  <text start="620.64" dur="9.06">October moving into November going into</text>

  <text start="648.79" dur="9.12">prices drop we&amp;#39;ve seen this before yes</text>
  <text start="655.45" dur="5.34">there are still cities that prices are</text>
  <text start="657.91" dur="5.7">going up and we saw this back in 2007</text>
  <text start="660.79" dur="5.97">going into 2008 prices were coming down</text>
  <text start="663.61" dur="8.13">in New York sales were incredible in</text>
  <text start="666.76" dur="8.75">Florida California was falling apart New</text>
  <text start="671.74" dur="8.67">York was fine we are starting to see</text>
  <text start="675.51" dur="9.07">what is happening here it&amp;#39;s losing</text>
  <text start="680.41" dur="7.32">momentum the bubble is popping but don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="684.58" dur="4.59">worry the bankers have come up with</text>
  <text start="687.73" dur="4.91">other plans because they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="689.17" dur="6.69">realize they&amp;#39;re running out of ideas and</text>
  <text start="692.64" dur="5.98">bullets to keep this system</text>
  <text start="695.86" dur="5.13">alive now we know Freddie and Fannie</text>
  <text start="698.62" dur="4.38">they came up to three percent down we</text>
  <text start="700.99" dur="4.11">know a lot of home builders are paying</text>
  <text start="703" dur="4.04">for a closing cost zero percent down a</text>
  <text start="705.1" dur="5.25">lot of banks went to zero percent down</text>
  <text start="707.04" dur="6.4">well Bank of America is now partnering</text>
  <text start="710.35" dur="4.65">with Freddie Mac on yet another scheme</text>
  <text start="713.44" dur="4.459">that will allow borrowers to get homes</text>
  <text start="715" dur="6.39">with loans as little as three percent</text>
  <text start="717.899" dur="5.741">but the difference here is guess what</text>
  <text start="721.39" dur="8.189">they&amp;#39;re getting rid of the mortgage</text>
  <text start="723.64" dur="8.43">insurance so we can see they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="729.579" dur="7.26">rid of that cost which will make it</text>
  <text start="732.07" dur="7.86">easier to get a mortgage payments will</text>
  <text start="736.839" dur="6.511">be lower and they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="739.93" dur="7.649">possibly can to get more and more</text>
  <text start="743.35" dur="5.88">Americans into the system so of course</text>
  <text start="747.579" dur="4.021">this means a greater percentage of low</text>
  <text start="749.23" dur="5.4">downpayment mortgages will end up being</text>
  <text start="751.6" dur="4.83">guaranteed by Freddie well this is going</text>
  <text start="754.63" dur="4.5">to be a problem it seems like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="756.43" dur="7.019">heading in town the same exact path as</text>
  <text start="759.13" dur="7.49">once we did back in 2007-2008 they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="763.449" dur="6.661">doing the same exact things we see</text>
  <text start="766.62" dur="5.98">manufacturing dropping once again the</text>
