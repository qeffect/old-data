  <text start="108.64" dur="6">look at this from retail necks and we</text>
  <text start="111.61" dur="5.07">look at the data we show that brick and</text>
  <text start="114.64" dur="3.78">mortar stores well their sales have</text>
  <text start="116.68" dur="4.17">fallen about five percent over the two</text>
  <text start="118.42" dur="6.39">days and the number of transactions fell</text>

  <text start="132.85" dur="5.76">one hundred percent of the purchases</text>
  <text start="134.26" dur="7.289">were on sale items now this fits into</text>
  <text start="138.61" dur="5.34">what has been going on where people lost</text>
  <text start="141.549" dur="4.741">their jobs people have part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="143.95" dur="5.759">they don&amp;#39;t have the funds to spend and</text>
  <text start="146.29" dur="5.88">when we look at this Gallup poll well it</text>
  <text start="149.709" dur="5.101">just confirms everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="152.17" dur="6.05">thinking because we can see right now</text>
  <text start="154.81" dur="7.05">that the data the Gallup has received</text>
  <text start="158.22" dur="9.359">shows that overall holiday spending</text>
  <text start="161.86" dur="8.52">plans have plunged in 2016 individuals</text>
  <text start="167.579" dur="6.071">have said this year they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="170.38" dur="8.22">spend a lot less money and it is</text>
  <text start="173.65" dur="7.2">declining so this shows us that people</text>
  <text start="178.6" dur="4.8">are struggling people are nervous</text>
  <text start="180.85" dur="5.22">people don&amp;#39;t have the funds and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="183.4" dur="4.83">not spending their money and we can also</text>
  <text start="186.07" dur="4.35">see it from what the stores are doing</text>
  <text start="188.23" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re trying all different try</text>
  <text start="190.42" dur="5.88">different methods of trying to bring the</text>
  <text start="193.33" dur="5.01">consumer in and they had the black</text>
  <text start="196.3" dur="4.62">friday sales going on like a week ahead</text>
  <text start="198.34" dur="4.74">of time the cyber monday sales are just</text>
  <text start="200.92" dur="3.66">not on Monday anymore and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="203.08" dur="4.11">continually doing this because what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="204.58" dur="5.52">happening is is they&amp;#39;re not getting the</text>
  <text start="207.19" dur="5.73">sales they want this is why a year ago</text>
  <text start="210.1" dur="7.44">or two years ago they tried opening up</text>
  <text start="212.92" dur="7.98">on Thanksgiving and they were open the</text>
  <text start="217.54" dur="6.15">entire day and they found out while</text>
  <text start="220.9" dur="4.77">sales didn&amp;#39;t increase doing that so now</text>
  <text start="223.69" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re trying something else instead of</text>
  <text start="225.67" dur="5.42">looking at what the real cause is the</text>
  <text start="227.59" dur="6.51">real causes the economy is in trouble</text>
  <text start="231.09" dur="5.71">people are being laid off people have</text>
  <text start="234.1" dur="5.88">part-time jobs people don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="236.8" dur="5.28">funds but they&amp;#39;re not looking at this</text>
  <text start="239.98" dur="4.35">and as we go through this holiday season</text>
  <text start="242.08" dur="3.3">it&amp;#39;s not going to improve it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="244.33" dur="3.03">get worse and we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot</text>
  <text start="245.38" dur="3.93">of stores closed down we saw it in the</text>
  <text start="247.36" dur="4.56">last two years where a lot of stores</text>
  <text start="249.31" dur="4.62">closed after the holiday season and what</text>
  <text start="251.92" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;re going to see is that this holiday</text>
  <text start="253.93" dur="6.059">season it&amp;#39;s going to show that the</text>
  <text start="257.14" dur="3.96">economy is really not doing what the</text>
  <text start="259.989" dur="3.421">corporate media what the US government</text>
  <text start="261.1" dur="4.26">what the central bank has been trying to</text>
  <text start="263.41" dur="4.74">convince us of that everything has</text>
  <text start="265.36" dur="5.34">recovered everything is fine because if</text>
  <text start="268.15" dur="4.62">this was so true spending would be up</text>
  <text start="270.7" dur="5.25">people would be comfortable in spending</text>
  <text start="272.77" dur="6.21">their money they wouldn&amp;#39;t be saying I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="275.95" dur="6.51">just looking for sale items they would</text>
  <text start="278.98" dur="6.18">increase their budgets but again we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="282.46" dur="5.01">not going to see this this year we see</text>
  <text start="285.16" dur="3.45">the housing market well it&amp;#39;s in trouble</text>
  <text start="287.47" dur="4.16">and this is coming from the wall street</text>
  <text start="288.61" dur="6.5">journal where it&amp;#39;s pointing out that</text>
  <text start="291.63" dur="7.48">mortgage refinancing their set to drop</text>
  <text start="295.11" dur="6.88">forty six percent in 2017 because the</text>
  <text start="299.11" dur="5.1">interest rates are rising well this</text>
  <text start="301.99" dur="3.75">should tell you something the only</text>
  <text start="304.21" dur="3.3">reason the real estate market is doing</text>
  <text start="305.74" dur="3.75">what it&amp;#39;s doing is because they</text>
  <text start="307.51" dur="4.59">manipulated they kept the interest rates</text>
  <text start="309.49" dur="4.63">very low they had a hedge funds</text>
  <text start="312.1" dur="4.3">investment companies come in</text>
  <text start="314.12" dur="4.68">purchase tons and tons of houses the</text>
  <text start="316.4" dur="6.84">central bank bought up the toxic real</text>
  <text start="318.8" dur="5.91">estate once the manipulation ends the</text>
  <text start="323.24" dur="4.34">real estate market is going to collapse</text>
  <text start="324.71" dur="6.48">and we&amp;#39;re already seeing signs of this</text>
  <text start="327.58" dur="7.119">because the Mortgage Bankers Association</text>
  <text start="331.19" dur="8.52">is saying that yeah if interest rates</text>
  <text start="334.699" dur="7.231">rise mortgage apps refinancing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="339.71" dur="5.25">going to completely implode on</text>
  <text start="341.93" dur="5.76">themselves and when we look at Case</text>
  <text start="344.96" dur="5.07">Shiller and we look at the bubble right</text>
  <text start="347.69" dur="5.82">now in all different areas in Atlanta in</text>
  <text start="350.03" dur="7.47">boston in dallas in denver we can see</text>
  <text start="353.51" dur="9.42">that right now housing prices in these</text>
  <text start="357.5" dur="14.87">select areas well the bubbles are larger</text>
  <text start="362.93" dur="12.989">than they were in 2007-2008 which means</text>
  <text start="372.37" dur="6.609">that when this crashes it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="375.919" dur="4.651">a complete disaster and when we look at</text>
  <text start="378.979" dur="3.931">all these different cities atlanta</text>
  <text start="380.57" dur="7.469">boston dallas denver north carolina</text>
  <text start="382.91" dur="6.93">Portland San Francisco Seattle we can</text>
  <text start="388.039" dur="3.871">see that this is part of the 20 cities</text>
  <text start="389.84" dur="4.44">this is where they&amp;#39;re having the hedge</text>
  <text start="391.91" dur="5.1">funds the investment companies come in</text>
  <text start="394.28" dur="5.13">foreign investors they&amp;#39;re doing whatever</text>
  <text start="397.01" dur="4.74">they possibly can to pump the bubbles up</text>
  <text start="399.41" dur="5.43">to make it look like real estate is</text>
  <text start="401.75" dur="4.62">really doing well right now and what</text>
  <text start="404.84" dur="4.109">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that when this whole</text>
  <text start="406.37" dur="7.019">thing comes crumbling apart it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="408.949" dur="10.44">to fall fast and hard there&amp;#39;s a new</text>
  <text start="413.389" dur="10.741">proposal now being whispered around the</text>
  <text start="419.389" dur="10.701">central banks in Europe to impose a tax</text>
  <text start="424.13" dur="5.96">on withdrawing your money from an ATM</text>
  <text start="430.539" dur="7.211">the banks say yeah this is a great idea</text>
  <text start="433.91" dur="7.229">of course it&amp;#39;s a great idea because this</text>
  <text start="437.75" dur="4.8">will prevent bank runs what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="441.139" dur="3.661">going to do is they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="442.55" dur="4.83">do whatever they possibly can to stop</text>
  <text start="444.8" dur="3.089">the bank runs why are they why do they</text>
  <text start="447.38" dur="2.789">want to</text>
  <text start="447.889" dur="5.46">up the bank runs why do they need a tax</text>
  <text start="450.169" dur="5.49">on withdrawing cash well first of all it</text>
  <text start="453.349" dur="6.63">gives them revenue secondly people think</text>
  <text start="455.659" dur="6.63">twice about using cash and you can be</text>
  <text start="459.979" dur="6.541">taxed quite a bit depending on how much</text>
  <text start="462.289" dur="5.91">money how much cash you take out so</text>
  <text start="466.52" dur="5.04">we&amp;#39;re heading into a very dangerous</text>
  <text start="468.199" dur="6.18">period where the central bank&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="471.56" dur="6.389">government&amp;#39;s they are becoming desperate</text>
  <text start="474.379" dur="6.871">and the war on cash right now is in full</text>
  <text start="477.949" dur="8.881">swing we see right now that India urgh</text>
  <text start="481.25" dur="8.849">way Australia and now Spain well they</text>
  <text start="486.83" dur="5.179">put their war on cash into overdrive the</text>
  <text start="490.099" dur="5.04">minister of finance and public service</text>
  <text start="492.009" dur="6.071">has reportedly announced in Spain that</text>
  <text start="495.139" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re going to put forth these</text>
  <text start="498.08" dur="6.209">measures in order to reduce the use of</text>
  <text start="500.449" dur="8.011">cash so Spain is going to make cash</text>
  <text start="504.289" dur="8.101">transactions even more difficult and we</text>
  <text start="508.46" dur="5.61">can see why this is happening Europe</text>
  <text start="512.39" dur="5.85">right now has negative interest rates</text>
  <text start="514.07" dur="6.659">Japan has negative interest rates people</text>
  <text start="518.24" dur="6.12">are saying why should I keep my cash in</text>
  <text start="520.729" dur="5.251">the bank it makes no sense many people</text>
  <text start="524.36" dur="4.14">are so nervous about the banking system</text>
  <text start="525.98" dur="6.09">that they&amp;#39;re removing their cash they</text>
  <text start="528.5" dur="5.82">get it in Greece they&amp;#39;re doing it now</text>
  <text start="532.07" dur="4.92">and they realize once the system comes</text>
  <text start="534.32" dur="4.92">down they need a way to lock in the cash</text>
  <text start="536.99" dur="3.839">this is why they would like to ban cash</text>
  <text start="539.24" dur="3.15">this is why they&amp;#39;re looking for all</text>
  <text start="540.829" dur="6.061">different methods to keep the cash</text>
  <text start="542.39" dur="7.98">inside of the banks because they want to</text>
  <text start="546.89" dur="5.52">use the bail in documents and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="550.37" dur="6.48">seeing right now is they&amp;#39;re making these</text>
  <text start="552.41" dur="7.4">last attempts to try to firm everything</text>
  <text start="556.85" dur="6.9">up before the entire system comes down</text>
  <text start="559.81" dur="6.58">we see out in Italy well there is the</text>
  <text start="563.75" dur="4.41">referendum that is looming and we see</text>
  <text start="566.39" dur="3.93">the bankers well they&amp;#39;re using their</text>
  <text start="568.16" dur="4.71">scare tactics telling you that</text>
  <text start="570.32" dur="5.25">everything&amp;#39;s going to fall apart if the</text>
  <text start="572.87" dur="5.04">referendum goes through that the banks</text>
  <text start="575.57" dur="6.03">are going to fail and this is what they</text>
  <text start="577.91" dur="6.21">did in the UK and this is what they do</text>
  <text start="581.6" dur="4.169">when things aren&amp;#39;t going their way when</text>
  <text start="584.12" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re trying to scare everyone into</text>
  <text start="585.769" dur="6.361">doing what they want and we can see that</text>
  <text start="588.5" dur="5.61">the Italian banks they are hurting we</text>
  <text start="592.13" dur="4.889">understand that they&amp;#39;re not doing well</text>
  <text start="594.11" dur="5.099">and we can see there&amp;#39;s a lot of bad</text>
  <text start="597.019" dur="5.521">loans Italy&amp;#39;s banks have about three</text>
  <text start="599.209" dur="7.5">hundred and sixty billion of 360 billion</text>
  <text start="602.54" dur="6.599">euros of problem loans and there are</text>
  <text start="606.709" dur="6.06">many banks that are having this problem</text>
  <text start="609.139" dur="6.18">and of course all these central bankers</text>
  <text start="612.769" dur="4.351">have to do is give the green light and</text>
  <text start="615.319" dur="4.281">they can bring anything down they want</text>
  <text start="617.12" dur="7.05">they have full control of the system</text>
  <text start="619.6" dur="6.25">everything is manipulated many people</text>
  <text start="624.17" dur="4.589">think that oh this is just a free market</text>
  <text start="625.85" dur="6.15">no it&amp;#39;s not today it is completely</text>
  <text start="628.759" dur="6.841">manipulated the central bank&amp;#39;s hold all</text>
  <text start="632" dur="7.62">the cards they can bring the system down</text>
  <text start="635.6" dur="7.469">whenever they want they can keep it</text>
  <text start="639.62" dur="5.459">going the only problem with that is that</text>
  <text start="643.069" dur="5.221">there could be some type of Black Swan</text>
  <text start="645.079" dur="5.221">that they didn&amp;#39;t figure on because as</text>
  <text start="648.29" dur="4.62">you know the central bankers plans they</text>
  <text start="650.3" dur="4.32">don&amp;#39;t always go as planned something can</text>
  <text start="652.91" dur="4.729">come out of left field right field and</text>
  <text start="654.62" dur="5.37">everything could completely fall apart</text>
  <text start="657.639" dur="5.591">so what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="659.99" dur="5.699">to keep everything alive they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="663.23" dur="5.849">to keep everything going until the right</text>
  <text start="665.689" dur="6.27">moment and what they&amp;#39;re waiting for is</text>
  <text start="669.079" dur="4.95">something to blame this entire crash</text>
  <text start="671.959" dur="5.421">shot now they were heading in the</text>
  <text start="674.029" dur="6.901">direction of blaming this all on Russia</text>
  <text start="677.38" dur="6.61">blaming it all on China blaming all on</text>
  <text start="680.93" dur="5.579">North Korea maybe Syria the Islamic</text>
  <text start="683.99" dur="5.699">state but we can see that&amp;#39;s all falling</text>
  <text start="686.509" dur="4.5">apart it&amp;#39;s going to be very difficult to</text>
  <text start="689.689" dur="4.351">do this at this point that can they</text>
  <text start="691.009" dur="5.58">still do it yes but then there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="694.04" dur="4.95">wild card which is Trump now we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="696.589" dur="3.87">know if he&amp;#39;s an insider and outsider we</text>
  <text start="698.99" dur="3.06">understand that rampal saying if you</text>
  <text start="700.459" dur="3.541">want to make America great once again</text>
  <text start="702.05" dur="4.92">get rid of the Fed I completely agree</text>
  <text start="704" dur="6.11">with him and we have to see the actions</text>
  <text start="706.97" dur="6.77">of Trump if he makes it that far and</text>
  <text start="710.11" dur="4.99">he&amp;#39;s actually sworn in in January</text>
  <text start="713.74" dur="3.49">because we</text>
  <text start="715.1" dur="4.14">can see the establishment a central bank</text>
  <text start="717.23" dur="7.5">the shadow government they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="719.24" dur="7.5">whatever they can to stop this and what</text>

  <text start="779.27" dur="6.8">again he&amp;#39;s done nothing and we also have</text>
  <text start="782.3" dur="6.45">to realize is that these globalists</text>
  <text start="786.07" dur="7.09">they&amp;#39;ve been working on their plans for</text>
  <text start="788.75" dur="8.91">a very long time they were molding the</text>
  <text start="793.16" dur="9.54">world into what they wanted they were</text>
  <text start="797.66" dur="8.61">creating the world in the image of what</text>

  <text start="832.85" dur="6.06">will go full throttle and trying to get</text>
  <text start="834.98" dur="5.46">their way and at this point everyone</text>
  <text start="838.91" dur="3.57">should be a little bit nervous everyone</text>
