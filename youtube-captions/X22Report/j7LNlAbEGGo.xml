  <text start="105.59" dur="5.22">moving transitioning into a new system</text>
  <text start="109.46" dur="2.64">now a lot of people don&amp;#39;t realize that</text>
  <text start="110.81" dur="4.979">this is actually happening</text>
  <text start="112.1" dur="6.6">just like they didn&amp;#39;t realize that we</text>
  <text start="115.789" dur="5.31">were entering the age of the internet no</text>
  <text start="118.7" dur="4.38">one really knew what it was no knew that</text>
  <text start="121.099" dur="4.91">the infrastructure was being built out</text>
  <text start="123.08" dur="5.28">new technology was coming online and</text>
  <text start="126.009" dur="4.42">people did not see the potential at that</text>
  <text start="128.36" dur="4.65">time of what it was really going to be</text>
  <text start="130.429" dur="4.861">and then eventually everyone realized it</text>
  <text start="133.01" dur="4.74">but those people that gone in on the</text>
  <text start="135.29" dur="3.66">ground floor they knew exactly what it</text>
  <text start="137.75" dur="3.39">was going to be now think about all</text>
  <text start="138.95" dur="4.38">those individuals back then who started</text>
  <text start="141.14" dur="4.83">to purchase all these domain names I</text>
  <text start="143.33" dur="4.8">mean for like pennies on the dollar I</text>
  <text start="145.97" dur="5.3">mean they were worth you know absolutely</text>
  <text start="148.13" dur="6.3">nothing at the time and they purchased</text>
  <text start="151.27" dur="5.77">thousands of them thousands upon</text>
  <text start="154.43" dur="4.38">thousands of domain names because these</text>
  <text start="157.04" dur="3.05">individuals knew eventually what was</text>
  <text start="158.81" dur="5.929">going to happen</text>
  <text start="160.09" dur="7.78">companies corporations stores people</text>
  <text start="164.739" dur="5.561">bloggers they were gonna want those</text>
  <text start="167.87" dur="4.47">names and they try to think of the most</text>
  <text start="170.3" dur="3.63">common names used out there they look at</text>
  <text start="172.34" dur="4.289">different businesses and they started to</text>
  <text start="173.93" dur="7.16">purchase them all up and what happened</text>
  <text start="176.629" dur="8.911">as time went on the internet evolved and</text>
  <text start="181.09" dur="5.74">these corporations bloggers they wanted</text>
  <text start="185.54" dur="4.65">these names</text>
  <text start="186.83" dur="5.67">and they would sell it to them for a</text>
  <text start="190.19" dur="4.77">huge profit all right you want this name</text>
  <text start="192.5" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s $10,000 I bought it for a dollar</text>

  <text start="205.16" dur="5.67">killing I mean a lot of money off the</text>
  <text start="208.34" dur="5.16">internet the same thing is happening</text>
  <text start="210.83" dur="5.31">right now a lot of people don&amp;#39;t realize</text>
  <text start="213.5" dur="5.19">that we have entered a transitional</text>
  <text start="216.14" dur="3.75">phase and everything that you see around</text>
  <text start="218.69" dur="5.3">you when you hear all these new</text>
  <text start="219.89" dur="6.39">cryptocurrencies being built developed</text>
  <text start="223.99" dur="4.12">for a specific reason there&amp;#39;s a reason</text>
  <text start="226.28" dur="5.07">why this is happening now just like the</text>
  <text start="228.11" dur="5.16">internet a lot of the sites that we once</text>
  <text start="231.35" dur="4.95">knew completely disappeared because they</text>
  <text start="233.27" dur="6.29">were worthless and those that stayed</text>
  <text start="236.3" dur="6.84">those are the ones that stuck around and</text>
  <text start="239.56" dur="6.91">became may be profitable or people use</text>
  <text start="243.14" dur="4.95">them same thing with cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="246.47" dur="3.27">there&amp;#39;s a lot of cryptocurrencies out</text>
  <text start="248.09" dur="4.59">there a lot of them are going to</text>
  <text start="249.74" dur="8.61">disappear but a lot of them are going to</text>
  <text start="252.68" dur="10.14">stay because they&amp;#39;re needed in this new</text>
  <text start="258.35" dur="6.63">transition and that is what we are</text>
  <text start="262.82" dur="4.44">seeing right now I&amp;#39;m gonna be talking</text>
  <text start="264.98" dur="5.64">about this a little while later in the</text>
  <text start="267.26" dur="6.99">report but let&amp;#39;s get into the risk of</text>
  <text start="270.62" dur="7.34">pension funds now back in the last</text>
  <text start="274.25" dur="6.33">financial crisis we saw that there were</text>
  <text start="277.96" dur="4.54">pension funds that lost hundreds of</text>
  <text start="280.58" dur="6.66">billions during the last financial</text>
  <text start="282.5" dur="9.21">crisis and right now the pensions there</text>
  <text start="287.24" dur="7.8">is a huge risk right now that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="291.71" dur="7.29">gonna be losing a lot more money why</text>
  <text start="295.04" dur="7.7">because a lot of them are in the stock</text>
  <text start="299" dur="7.11">market they based their pension</text>
  <text start="302.74" dur="8.02">projections on an interest rates between</text>
  <text start="306.11" dur="7.44">six to eight percent well with zerp</text>
  <text start="310.76" dur="6.27">they&amp;#39;re not getting that so they started</text>
  <text start="313.55" dur="5.46">to invest in the market and we can see</text>
  <text start="317.03" dur="4.06">right now as the market came down just a</text>
  <text start="319.01" dur="6.07">little bit it hurt a lot of the</text>
  <text start="321.09" dur="6.06">pension funds during the last crisis a</text>
  <text start="325.08" dur="4.74">lot of pension funds disappeared a lot</text>
  <text start="327.15" dur="6.42">of people lost their wealth and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="329.82" dur="8.64">going to see this again now what they</text>
  <text start="333.57" dur="7.71">did going back in time is this is about</text>
  <text start="338.46" dur="4.709">30 or so years ago state and local</text>
  <text start="341.28" dur="5.58">politicians and leaders of their public</text>
  <text start="343.169" dur="7.5">employee unions had a shared epiphany if</text>
  <text start="346.86" dur="6.69">they offered workers hyper generous</text>
  <text start="350.669" dur="4.651">pensions they could buy labor peace the</text>
  <text start="353.55" dur="3.69">labor piece without having to grant i</text>
  <text start="355.32" dur="3.81">popping headline and grabbing wage</text>
  <text start="357.24" dur="3.87">increases and if they made</text>
  <text start="359.13" dur="3.81">unrealistically high assumptions about</text>
  <text start="361.11" dur="3.9">the returns they could generate on</text>
  <text start="362.94" dur="4.86">pension plan assets they could keep</text>
  <text start="365.01" dur="4.86">required contributions nice and low thus</text>
  <text start="367.8" dur="4.29">making both workers and taxpayers happy</text>
  <text start="369.87" dur="4.919">the result jobs security for the</text>
  <text start="372.09" dur="5.31">politicians and union leaders and a full</text>
  <text start="374.789" dur="5.281">sense of affluence for workers and</text>
  <text start="377.4" dur="5.7">taxpayers this scam worked beautifully</text>
  <text start="380.07" dur="5.159">for for as long as it needed to which is</text>
  <text start="383.1" dur="4.23">to say until the architects of the</text>
  <text start="385.229" dur="5.16">over-generous benefits and unrealistic</text>
  <text start="387.33" dur="6.75">assumptions retired rich and happy but</text>
  <text start="390.389" dur="6.481">now the unworkable math is coming to</text>
  <text start="394.08" dur="5.73">light and pension funds are responding</text>
  <text start="396.87" dur="5.22">with two strategies roll the dice by</text>
  <text start="399.81" dur="4.5">loading up on equities the most volatile</text>
  <text start="402.09" dur="3.81">asset class available along with real</text>
  <text start="404.31" dur="3.06">estate commodities hedge funds and</text>
  <text start="405.9" dur="5.1">private equity holdings</text>
  <text start="407.37" dur="5.669">number two buy the dips stocks have been</text>
  <text start="411" dur="4.919">going up so steadily for so long that</text>
  <text start="413.039" dur="6.361">pension fund managers now see volatility</text>
  <text start="415.919" dur="5.341">as an investing opportunity when the</text>
  <text start="419.4" dur="5.01">next downturn hits they&amp;#39;ll throw good</text>
  <text start="421.26" dur="7.02">money after bad magnifying their losses</text>
  <text start="424.41" dur="8.569">now eventually a real bear market is</text>
  <text start="428.28" dur="7.17">going to hit and this is when pensions</text>
  <text start="432.979" dur="5.881">completely fall apart the pension</text>
  <text start="435.45" dur="6.029">machine comes to a screeching hole and</text>
  <text start="438.86" dur="5.32">the several trillion dollars of</text>
  <text start="441.479" dur="5.16">obligations will migrate from state and</text>
  <text start="444.18" dur="5.64">local governments to Washington which is</text>
  <text start="446.639" dur="6.61">to say taxpayers in general at a time</text>
  <text start="449.82" dur="6.759">when federal debts are already soaring</text>
  <text start="453.249" dur="7.86">this time is quickly approaching the</text>
  <text start="456.579" dur="7.5">system that we are in right now can no</text>
  <text start="461.109" dur="5.28">way be sustained it&amp;#39;s like a corporation</text>
  <text start="464.079" dur="4.26">that has a huge amount of debt and a lot</text>
  <text start="466.389" dur="3.78">of corporations out there have a huge</text>
  <text start="468.339" dur="4.29">amount of that retail stores have a huge</text>
  <text start="470.169" dur="4.77">amount of debt and when they can&amp;#39;t pay</text>
  <text start="472.629" dur="5.49">the debt when they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="474.939" dur="6.48">revenue coming in and the debt is rising</text>
  <text start="478.119" dur="5.31">at a faster pace than the revenue coming</text>
  <text start="481.419" dur="3.75">in and the revenue can&amp;#39;t pay for the</text>
  <text start="483.429" dur="4.11">interest even when the interest is</text>
  <text start="485.169" dur="4.05">brought down close to zero there is a</text>
  <text start="487.539" dur="4.74">major problem and that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="489.219" dur="5.4">right now they know this in government</text>
  <text start="492.279" dur="4.8">Trump knows this the central bankers</text>
  <text start="494.619" dur="5.37">know this yes to the everyday person</text>
  <text start="497.079" dur="5.25">they come out on the corporate media</text>
  <text start="499.989" dur="4.26">they make announcement that everything</text>
  <text start="502.329" dur="4.14">is fine don&amp;#39;t worry about it</text>
  <text start="504.249" dur="3.99">I remember during the 2008 crisis when I</text>
  <text start="506.469" dur="3.45">went into the bank bank of america and</text>
  <text start="508.239" dur="3.75">the tellers were down there and i asked</text>
  <text start="509.919" dur="3.631">the question at the time when we heard</text>
  <text start="511.989" dur="2.82">different banks having troubled house</text>
  <text start="513.55" dur="4.2">bank of america doing their there</text>
  <text start="514.809" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re fun right oh we&amp;#39;re solid nothing</text>
  <text start="517.75" dur="4.68">to worry about everything is fantastic</text>
  <text start="519.729" dur="5.85">and then two weeks later you find out oh</text>
  <text start="522.43" dur="5.94">they need a bailout people really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="525.579" dur="5.01">understand what is going on behind the</text>
  <text start="528.37" dur="3.54">scenes and this is what we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="530.589" dur="3.031">right now we&amp;#39;re looking behind the</text>
  <text start="531.91" dur="5.09">scenes and we&amp;#39;re seeing that there are</text>
  <text start="533.62" dur="6.449">major problems headed our way the system</text>
  <text start="537" dur="4.809">cannot continue on the way it is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="540.069" dur="3.63">completely impossible and they already</text>
  <text start="541.809" dur="3.51">know this so behind the scenes they know</text>
  <text start="543.699" dur="4.651">it but everyone out in the front like</text>
  <text start="545.319" dur="7.5">those tellers have no clue they have no</text>
  <text start="548.35" dur="7.429">idea and this is what is happening right</text>
  <text start="552.819" dur="6.091">now we have two transitions coming up</text>
  <text start="555.779" dur="5.591">one that the central bankers one the</text>
  <text start="558.91" dur="4.799">other one is what the people want and</text>
  <text start="561.37" dur="3.779">other governments who don&amp;#39;t want to deal</text>
  <text start="563.709" dur="4.56">with the dollar this is what they want</text>
  <text start="565.149" dur="4.531">the transition and I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="568.269" dur="5.341">people transition and the central bank</text>
  <text start="569.68" dur="5.61">transition it has already begun I mean</text>
  <text start="573.61" dur="3.229">the central bank transition has begun a</text>
  <text start="575.29" dur="3.75">long time ago when they started moving</text>
  <text start="576.839" dur="4.18">manufacturing when they started to</text>
  <text start="579.04" dur="4.649">duplicate the systems out in China and</text>
  <text start="581.019" dur="5.221">Russia when China and Russia were</text>
  <text start="583.689" dur="3.21">ramping up gold the central bankers</text>
  <text start="586.24" dur="2.579">that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="586.899" dur="4.44">where they wanted a set up shop that was</text>
  <text start="588.819" dur="4.861">their plan have the manufacturing have</text>
  <text start="591.339" dur="4.771">the gold had the petrol yuyuan have</text>
  <text start="593.68" dur="6.12">everything that was duplicated from the</text>
  <text start="596.11" dur="7.649">west to the east 2008 crisis we have</text>
  <text start="599.8" dur="6.959">cryptocurrencies we see over a very very</text>
  <text start="603.759" dur="4.77">short period of time there is a lot of</text>
  <text start="606.759" dur="5.31">cryptocurrencies there is like salt</text>
  <text start="608.529" dur="5.97">which allows you to lend just like a</text>
  <text start="612.069" dur="5.3">bank but you don&amp;#39;t need a bank there is</text>
  <text start="614.499" dur="5.221">litecoin where Amazon Facebook and other</text>
  <text start="617.369" dur="4.78">corporations they&amp;#39;re looking to use this</text>
  <text start="619.72" dur="5.7">so people can use their cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="622.149" dur="5.901">to pay for merchandise employers are</text>
  <text start="625.42" dur="5.94">looking to pay individuals in</text>
  <text start="628.05" dur="6.029">cryptocurrency and we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="631.36" dur="5.25">now that there&amp;#39;s a lot of good</text>
  <text start="634.079" dur="5.29">cryptocurrency especially the etherium</text>
  <text start="636.61" dur="5.37">platform where a lot of it can be built</text>
  <text start="639.369" dur="7.111">on we can see that there are countries</text>
  <text start="641.98" dur="8.399">now that have already started to create</text>
  <text start="646.48" dur="6.56">their own currency system outside of the</text>
  <text start="650.379" dur="6.45">banking system outside of the dollar</text>
  <text start="653.04" dur="7.18">what this means is that this transition</text>
  <text start="656.829" dur="5.341">is off and running and it doesn&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="660.22" dur="4.89">that long yesterday we mentioned that</text>

  <text start="678.37" dur="6.48">cryptocurrency not buy all by oil but</text>
  <text start="681.61" dur="7.229">buy gold and the reason they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="684.85" dur="7.469">this is to show the world that it is</text>
  <text start="688.839" dur="5.85">stable you can have confidence in it</text>
  <text start="692.319" dur="6.421">that&amp;#39;s why you use gold it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="694.689" dur="7.531">confidence builder the country or the</text>
  <text start="698.74" dur="7.139">entity that has the gold they control</text>
  <text start="702.22" dur="6.619">the currency and this is what we are</text>
  <text start="705.879" dur="6.15">seeing right now that transition is</text>
  <text start="708.839" dur="4.571">already moving forward a lot of people</text>

  <text start="840.55" dur="3.3">why the central bankers are getting very</text>
  <text start="842.59" dur="2.49">very worried and this is why you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="843.85" dur="3.24">seeing all the corporate media news</text>
  <text start="845.08" dur="3.87">stories come out because what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="847.09" dur="4.71">trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="848.95" dur="5.4">people away from this a lot of countries</text>
  <text start="851.8" dur="4.74">right now we&amp;#39;ll be looking at venez</text>
  <text start="854.35" dur="4.13">they&amp;#39;re gonna watch them see how the</text>

  <text start="858.48" dur="5.2">successfully guess what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="860.62" dur="6.81">happen many more countries are going to</text>
  <text start="863.68" dur="6.09">jump on the bandwagon at the same time</text>
  <text start="867.43" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re going to be dumping the dollar</text>
  <text start="869.77" dur="5.7">so what happens when the dollar is</text>
  <text start="871.9" dur="5.67">dumped when the dollar is dumped that</text>
  <text start="875.47" dur="4.08">means they don&amp;#39;t have to hold it in</text>
  <text start="877.57" dur="4.08">reserve that means they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="879.55" dur="5.25">using a different currency to allow</text>
  <text start="881.65" dur="5.42">other countries to pay for the oil and</text>
  <text start="884.8" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;ll be using their cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="887.07" dur="7.57">Venezuela for perfect example I mean</text>
  <text start="890.53" dur="7.62">next could be Syria then Iran then Libya</text>
  <text start="894.64" dur="5.1">then Lebanon and more and more of these</text>
  <text start="898.15" dur="4.14">countries as they keep doing this</text>
  <text start="899.74" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re gonna say okay wait a minute I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="902.29" dur="4.44">using their cryptocurrency to purchase</text>
  <text start="904.6" dur="6.06">the oil why don&amp;#39;t we start our own</text>
  <text start="906.73" dur="7.41">cryptocurrency for our own country why</text>
  <text start="910.66" dur="5.7">are we using dollar or paper or anything</text>
  <text start="914.14" dur="4.05">like that and they start developed</text>
  <text start="916.36" dur="3.99">developing their own cryptocurrency it</text>
  <text start="918.19" dur="6.33">only takes a couple of months then they</text>
  <text start="920.35" dur="5.82">have their own and this is what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="924.52" dur="2.94">to happen and it&amp;#39;s going to happen very</text>
  <text start="926.17" dur="3.78">very quickly</text>
  <text start="927.46" dur="6">now all those dollars all these paper</text>
  <text start="929.95" dur="6.84">electronic blips guess what they come</text>
  <text start="933.46" dur="5.37">back to the United States and the United</text>
  <text start="936.79" dur="5.61">States then is flooded with this</text>
  <text start="938.83" dur="6.09">worthless paper blips that nobody wants</text>
  <text start="942.4" dur="4.74">and as it comes back to the United</text>
  <text start="944.92" dur="6.3">States there&amp;#39;s a lot more dollars in</text>
  <text start="947.14" dur="7.41">circulation which means the dollar loses</text>
  <text start="951.22" dur="7.11">value which means it&amp;#39;s much more</text>
  <text start="954.55" dur="5.52">difficult to purchase goods because you</text>
  <text start="958.33" dur="4.68">need a lot more dollars to pay for that</text>
  <text start="960.07" dur="5.4">piece of I mean that loaf of bread or to</text>
  <text start="963.01" dur="4.41">purchase oil and then when everyone</text>
  <text start="965.47" dur="4.56">stops using the dollar and using</text>
  <text start="967.42" dur="4.92">cryptocurrency the United States has a</text>
  <text start="970.03" dur="4.56">choice use cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="972.34" dur="6.3">or not or you&amp;#39;re not going to get</text>
  <text start="974.59" dur="6.99">anything the shelves will go bare credit</text>
  <text start="978.64" dur="4.67">will freeze up and here in the United</text>
  <text start="981.58" dur="4.26">States will be a very difficult time</text>
  <text start="983.31" dur="4.18">that&amp;#39;s if the central bankers stay in</text>
  <text start="985.84" dur="5.01">power and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="987.49" dur="5.61">with the crypto system here in the</text>
  <text start="990.85" dur="4.049">United States if we see a lot of other</text>
  <text start="993.1" dur="4.979">countries like the BRIC nations starting</text>
  <text start="994.899" dur="6.63">to move away from the dollar and start</text>
