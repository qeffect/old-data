  <text start="140.609" dur="3.961">they&amp;#39;re really more interested in</text>
  <text start="141.959" dur="4.231">propaganda and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="144.57" dur="3.6">now is that the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="146.19" dur="3.48">already showing that the housing market</text>
  <text start="148.17" dur="5.33">is fizzling they&amp;#39;re saying it started to</text>
  <text start="149.67" dur="7.11">fizzle back in 2017 and here we are</text>
  <text start="153.5" dur="7.269">reporting about how the housing market</text>

  <text start="173.16" dur="6.24">well I mean Trump inherited a complete</text>
  <text start="176.43" dur="5.85">disaster and it&amp;#39;s still a complete</text>
  <text start="179.4" dur="6.48">disaster because it&amp;#39;s a central bank</text>
  <text start="182.28" dur="4.65">economy it&amp;#39;s not a president economy the</text>
  <text start="185.88" dur="3.15">president</text>
  <text start="186.93" dur="3.96">makes laws about taxes and things like</text>
  <text start="189.03" dur="6.709">that but that all filters back to the</text>
  <text start="190.89" dur="8.459">central bank remember the government is</text>
  <text start="195.739" dur="7.511">controlled by the central bank because</text>
  <text start="199.349" dur="7.381">they have to borrow all the currency I</text>
  <text start="203.25" dur="4.859">mean we have talks of the government</text>
  <text start="206.73" dur="2.759">shutting down because they&amp;#39;re running</text>
  <text start="208.109" dur="3.511">out of money the government ran out of</text>
  <text start="209.489" dur="6.87">money a long time ago they&amp;#39;re borrowing</text>
  <text start="211.62" dur="6.3">money they don&amp;#39;t have any money but of</text>
  <text start="216.359" dur="2.731">course they&amp;#39;re making us believe that</text>
  <text start="217.92" dur="3.719">the government is going to be running</text>
  <text start="219.09" dur="5.7">out of money this is all borrowed money</text>
  <text start="221.639" dur="7.47">from the central bank so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="224.79" dur="6.029">real it&amp;#39;s completely fake now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="229.109" dur="3.121">gonna start to see is and this is not</text>
  <text start="230.819" dur="3">going to happen all at once we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="232.23" dur="3.42">see a lot of stories from the corporate</text>
  <text start="233.819" dur="4.021">media on how different parts of the</text>
  <text start="235.65" dur="4.319">economy aren&amp;#39;t doing as well anymore and</text>
  <text start="237.84" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re gonna make this known to</text>
  <text start="239.969" dur="6.6">everyone now we already see that the</text>
  <text start="242.28" dur="6.389">housing market has been slowly crashing</text>
  <text start="246.569" dur="4.2">and this is from the bubbles that the</text>
  <text start="248.669" dur="4.141">central banks have pumped up over a</text>
  <text start="250.769" dur="3.81">period of time now housing starts</text>
  <text start="252.81" dur="4.079">theya plunged by eight point two percent</text>
  <text start="254.579" dur="4.741">month a month in December this is five</text>
  <text start="256.889" dur="4.581">times worse than expected and the</text>
  <text start="259.32" dur="6.33">biggest drop since November 2016 and</text>
  <text start="261.47" dur="8.53">remember November was now revised lower</text>
  <text start="265.65" dur="7.41">and we could see at this point that was</text>
  <text start="270" dur="4.71">there really a recovery in housing no</text>
  <text start="273.06" dur="3.72">because when we look at housing starts</text>
  <text start="274.71" dur="6.06">you&amp;#39;re on your change it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="276.78" dur="7.16">declining since the pump up around mid</text>
  <text start="280.77" dur="5.85">2012 and it&amp;#39;s been declining ever since</text>
  <text start="283.94" dur="6.039">which shows us there was never a</text>
  <text start="286.62" dur="6.21">recovery it was an inflation of a bubble</text>
  <text start="289.979" dur="4.951">and the bubble is losing air and what</text>
  <text start="292.83" dur="4.429">happens with people losing their job</text>
  <text start="294.93" dur="5.239">people not making enough money and</text>
  <text start="297.259" dur="7.84">housing prices going through the roof</text>
  <text start="300.169" dur="8.141">people can&amp;#39;t afford it that leaves hedge</text>
  <text start="305.099" dur="5.401">funds investors getting free money from</text>
  <text start="308.31" dur="4.829">the Fed foreign investors and when</text>
  <text start="310.5" dur="5.82">foreign investors leave it leaves less</text>
  <text start="313.139" dur="6.27">individuals or less groups in the mix</text>
  <text start="316.32" dur="4.679">now Chinese investors they been leaving</text>
  <text start="319.409" dur="3.9">because they&amp;#39;ve been told to take their</text>
  <text start="320.999" dur="6.03">and put it back into the one belt one</text>
  <text start="323.309" dur="5.43">road and invest in themselves housing is</text>
  <text start="327.029" dur="3.39">now falling the American people have</text>
  <text start="328.739" dur="4.77">been on the sidelines for a very long</text>
  <text start="330.419" dur="6.71">time so we see housing falling apart in</text>
  <text start="333.509" dur="6.99">Canada Australia the United States</text>
  <text start="337.129" dur="5.62">countries throughout Europe and once</text>
  <text start="340.499" dur="5.43">this goes it&amp;#39;s going to be absolutely</text>
  <text start="342.749" dur="7.17">awful now we see the Philly Fed well</text>
  <text start="345.929" dur="7.17">this has slumped also it has reached its</text>
  <text start="349.919" dur="5.16">highest since 2014 in mid 2017 where</text>
  <text start="353.099" dur="5.4">they still called it the Obama economy</text>
  <text start="355.079" dur="6.51">and the Philly Fed has been sliding</text>
  <text start="358.499" dur="6.361">since that period of time like I said</text>
  <text start="361.589" dur="6.66">we&amp;#39;re going to sit this was all everyone</text>
  <text start="364.86" dur="6.569">getting in pushing it up bubbles moving</text>
  <text start="368.249" dur="6.48">up and then slowly bringing it down</text>
  <text start="371.429" dur="6.78">making it look like now the economy is</text>
  <text start="374.729" dur="5.25">failing we see this happening right in</text>
  <text start="378.209" dur="3.84">front of our eyes and we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="379.979" dur="4.68">the corporate media come out with more</text>
  <text start="382.049" dur="5.22">information on this saying how the</text>
  <text start="384.659" dur="5.4">economy&amp;#39;s not doing as well as it was</text>
  <text start="387.269" dur="4.38">during Obama&amp;#39;s time because of</text>
  <text start="390.059" dur="3.78">everything that Trump has been doing</text>
  <text start="391.649" dur="4.401">which is completely fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="393.839" dur="4.83">the economy never really went anywhere</text>
  <text start="396.05" dur="4.929">this was just bubbles being pumped up</text>
  <text start="398.669" dur="5.07">free money pushed in to make it look</text>
  <text start="400.979" dur="4.8">like things were great and then they</text>
  <text start="403.739" dur="4.65">gave it some time Trump brought it down</text>
  <text start="405.779" dur="3.78">this is the setup right now and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="408.389" dur="3.3">gonna see the corporate media start to</text>
  <text start="409.559" dur="4.53">report on this now it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="411.689" dur="5.79">we talked about NAFTA and Trump when he</text>
  <text start="414.089" dur="5.271">he was out there campaigning he said he</text>
  <text start="417.479" dur="3.87">was gonna get rid of NAFTA and of course</text>
  <text start="419.36" dur="5.079">everything that you say on the campaign</text>
  <text start="421.349" dur="5.13">sometimes you have to do other things</text>
  <text start="424.439" dur="4.59">before you get to it now there are other</text>
  <text start="426.479" dur="4.41">presidents that they just say things in</text>
  <text start="429.029" dur="4.2">their campaign just to say them and they</text>
  <text start="430.889" dur="4.95">never do anything with it they just lied</text>
  <text start="433.229" dur="4.05">now we&amp;#39;re looking at Trump a month</text>
  <text start="435.839" dur="3.96">saying that he&amp;#39;s doing everything that</text>
  <text start="437.279" dur="4.65">he says I&amp;#39;m not saying that he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="439.799" dur="4.5">to be doing everything he says but what</text>
  <text start="441.929" dur="4.74">we can see right now is that his actions</text>
  <text start="444.299" dur="4.32">and what he&amp;#39;s doing is moving in that</text>
  <text start="446.669" dur="4.47">direction and we also need to remember</text>
  <text start="448.619" dur="5.1">is that he&amp;#39;s fighting against the deep</text>
  <text start="451.139" dur="3.601">state the Cabal which is very very</text>
  <text start="453.719" dur="2.311">difficult</text>
  <text start="454.74" dur="4.26">because they&amp;#39;re so entrenched in</text>
  <text start="456.03" dur="4.859">government and we see that with NAFTA</text>
  <text start="459" dur="4.97">they started out saying we&amp;#39;re gonna get</text>
  <text start="460.889" dur="6.15">rid of NAFTA and that there was a lot of</text>
  <text start="463.97" dur="4.87">Republicans Democrats within the</text>
  <text start="467.039" dur="4.171">government all part of the same thing</text>
  <text start="468.84" dur="4.53">saying that no you can&amp;#39;t do this we need</text>
  <text start="471.21" dur="4.769">discussions and so we said okay you know</text>
  <text start="473.37" dur="4.949">what let&amp;#39;s make a new deal out of NAFTA</text>
  <text start="475.979" dur="4.711">let&amp;#39;s discuss it now and I&amp;#39;ve said this</text>
  <text start="478.319" dur="4.261">a couple of reports ago eventually what</text>
  <text start="480.69" dur="5.31">I think he&amp;#39;s going to do is he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="482.58" dur="6.059">give them this to read discuss NAFTA and</text>
  <text start="486" dur="5.52">then slowly push them into cancelling</text>
  <text start="488.639" dur="5.52">NAFTA altogether and it looks like right</text>
  <text start="491.52" dur="4.2">now Trump said that terminating the</text>
  <text start="494.159" dur="5.491">North American Free Trade Agreement</text>
  <text start="495.72" dur="6.12">would result in the best deal and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="499.65" dur="4.829">saying that hey listen we might have to</text>
  <text start="501.84" dur="5.009">terminate NAFTA and I think this is the</text>
  <text start="504.479" dur="5.131">direction he&amp;#39;s going in and I think he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="506.849" dur="5.43">going to actually get rid of it in the</text>
  <text start="509.61" dur="6.479">end just like the TPP and the rest boom</text>
  <text start="512.279" dur="8.461">gone we see the dollar index broke down</text>
  <text start="516.089" dur="8.221">to its weakest level since 2014 and even</text>
  <text start="520.74" dur="5.49">though the Fed is raising rates and the</text>
  <text start="524.31" dur="4.7">stock market&amp;#39;s going up and everything</text>
  <text start="526.23" dur="6.03">seems great the dollar index is</text>
  <text start="529.01" dur="6.21">weakening right now and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="532.26" dur="6.319">seeing is that the economy the dollar</text>
  <text start="535.22" dur="7.059">it&amp;#39;s been weakening for a very long time</text>
  <text start="538.579" dur="7.151">this is the end game this is the end of</text>
  <text start="542.279" dur="7.411">a system the end of the dollar as we</text>
  <text start="545.73" dur="6.33">know it today and we can see that China</text>
  <text start="549.69" dur="5.639">right now they know exactly what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="552.06" dur="6.149">happening why because the entire system</text>
  <text start="555.329" dur="6.51">is going to be moved from the u.s. to</text>
  <text start="558.209" dur="6.271">China the central bank does not care</text>
  <text start="561.839" dur="4.44">they have no allegiance to a country</text>
  <text start="564.48" dur="4.71">group of people they could care less</text>
  <text start="566.279" dur="6.331">about that the only reason the Cabal</text>
  <text start="569.19" dur="5.19">likes the Fed is because they make a</text>
  <text start="572.61" dur="3.63">huge amount of money they can sanction</text>
  <text start="574.38" dur="4.68">other countries they can control</text>
  <text start="576.24" dur="4.62">countries but the actual central by</text>
  <text start="579.06" dur="4.05">central bank of all central banks the</text>
  <text start="580.86" dur="4.68">Rothschilds they don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="583.11" dur="6.44">countries they don&amp;#39;t care about the</text>
  <text start="585.54" dur="8.13">people they care about controlling this</text>
  <text start="589.55" dur="7.3">loaning this currency out with interest</text>
  <text start="593.67" dur="8.57">attached which could never ever be</text>
  <text start="596.85" dur="8.46">repaid it&amp;#39;s completely impossible and</text>
  <text start="602.24" dur="6.46">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="605.31" dur="6.05">setting everything up and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="608.7" dur="6.63">be moved away from the United States and</text>
  <text start="611.36" dur="7.979">the central bank doesn&amp;#39;t care this is</text>
  <text start="615.33" dur="6.9">why the Chinese credit rating agency</text>
  <text start="619.339" dur="5.261">downgraded the United States S&amp;amp;P Moody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="622.23" dur="4.68">Fitch they didn&amp;#39;t do anything because</text>
  <text start="624.6" dur="4.739">they understand this debt cannot be</text>
  <text start="626.91" dur="5.31">sustained everything is being put into</text>
  <text start="629.339" dur="7.921">place and we see it happening right now</text>
  <text start="632.22" dur="7.35">now China we see them dumping Treasuries</text>
  <text start="637.26" dur="4.53">according to the just released Treasury</text>
  <text start="639.57" dur="2.97">International Capital data for the month</text>
  <text start="641.79" dur="2.97">of November</text>
  <text start="642.54" dur="5.43">Chinese Treasury Holdings dropped from</text>
  <text start="644.76" dur="6.269">one point one eight nine billion in</text>
  <text start="647.97" dur="5.7">October to one point one seven six</text>
  <text start="651.029" dur="6.091">billion in December this is the lowest</text>
  <text start="653.67" dur="7.77">since July this might be accelerated if</text>
  <text start="657.12" dur="6.42">the US and China enter a trade war China</text>
  <text start="661.44" dur="4.47">is that they&amp;#39;re saying listen we will</text>
  <text start="663.54" dur="5.489">dump more Treasuries if we go into a</text>
  <text start="665.91" dur="5.7">trade war and I think China is gonna end</text>
  <text start="669.029" dur="5.841">up dumping a lot more because as the</text>
  <text start="671.61" dur="5.94">system is being prepared and ready to be</text>
  <text start="674.87" dur="5.55">transitioned to over to China there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="677.55" dur="6.15">reason for China to have Treasuries</text>
  <text start="680.42" dur="5.77">especially when they just downgraded the</text>
  <text start="683.7" dur="3.389">United States think about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="686.19" dur="3.39">happening here</text>
  <text start="687.089" dur="4.62">Japan they hold about one point zero</text>
  <text start="689.58" dur="3.87">eight trillion worth of Treasuries they</text>
  <text start="691.709" dur="4.261">decreased it by nine point nine billion</text>
  <text start="693.45" dur="5.4">from last month so we see countries</text>

  <text start="892.74" dur="4.65">this is what&amp;#39;s going to happen but Trump</text>
  <text start="894.21" dur="6.99">does know he needs to get out of this</text>
  <text start="897.39" dur="6.9">old system this old system is death this</text>
  <text start="901.2" dur="6.21">old system is spiraling downwards he</text>
  <text start="904.29" dur="6.24">knows this and he&amp;#39;s trying to transition</text>
  <text start="907.41" dur="5.94">us into a new system prepare us for the</text>
  <text start="910.53" dur="3.75">new system that is what is happening</text>
  <text start="913.35" dur="1.98">right now and this is why all these</text>
  <text start="914.28" dur="4.5">trade agreements that we have right now</text>
  <text start="915.33" dur="6.24">need to be completely eradicated because</text>
  <text start="918.78" dur="4.8">they don&amp;#39;t benefit the United States or</text>
  <text start="921.57" dur="5.52">the people of the United States it</text>
  <text start="923.58" dur="7.05">benefits the deep state the Cabal at the</text>
  <text start="927.09" dur="5.01">time it worked to benefit them it didn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="932.1" dur="5.31">jobs it didn&amp;#39;t help the country out and</text>
  <text start="934.55" dur="4.6">this is why this is being done and this</text>
  <text start="937.41" dur="4.26">is why Trump has been speaking to</text>
  <text start="939.15" dur="5.46">Jinping about the one belt one road and</text>
  <text start="941.67" dur="5.7">most likely we the United States will be</text>
  <text start="944.61" dur="5.34">joining these this new trade system</text>
  <text start="947.37" dur="5.06">because this new trade system this is</text>
  <text start="949.95" dur="8.46">going to be throughout Asia Europe</text>
  <text start="952.43" dur="8.92">Africa South Africa and eventually the</text>
  <text start="958.41" dur="4.56">United States and we&amp;#39;re seeing this is</text>
  <text start="961.35" dur="3.21">what this is all being set up for but</text>
  <text start="962.97" dur="5.49">we&amp;#39;re going to go through a transition a</text>
  <text start="964.56" dur="6.51">transition from this dying system into a</text>
  <text start="968.46" dur="4.47">new system that is completely separate</text>
  <text start="971.07" dur="3.17">and apart from the United States will</text>
  <text start="972.93" dur="4.83">not be the reserve currency of the world</text>
  <text start="974.24" dur="5.14">unless the people around the world can</text>
  <text start="977.76" dur="3.72">stand up and say you know we do we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="979.38" dur="3.87">want the central bank system we would</text>
  <text start="981.48" dur="4.02">like to have maybe the blockchain a</text>
  <text start="983.25" dur="5.1">crypto currency of our own where we can</text>
  <text start="985.5" dur="4.529">can control it we don&amp;#39;t need banks we</text>
  <text start="988.35" dur="3.929">there&amp;#39;s no reason for them</text>
  <text start="990.029" dur="5.67">and you know what the currency can be</text>
  <text start="992.279" dur="5.521">issued without interest there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="995.699" dur="4.651">reason to have the central bank they</text>
  <text start="997.8" dur="4.92">really don&amp;#39;t do anything if this is how</text>
  <text start="1000.35" dur="4.409">they manage the global economy the</text>
  <text start="1002.72" dur="4.559">economies of countries most of them are</text>

  <text start="1023.24" dur="4.819">seeing right now is a push and I do</text>
  <text start="1025.52" dur="5.7">believe this is going to be a huge push</text>
  <text start="1028.059" dur="6.911">to get rid of the central banking system</text>
  <text start="1031.22" dur="5.91">and we see at this point just maybe just</text>

  <text start="1037.13" dur="5.459">to get rid of it and this is the push</text>
  <text start="1039.679" dur="5.671">but we will go through a transition the</text>
  <text start="1042.589" dur="6.09">transition will either be a hard fall if</text>
  <text start="1045.35" dur="5.55">it&amp;#39;s created by the central bank if we</text>
  <text start="1048.679" dur="3.961">go through this collapse the central</text>
