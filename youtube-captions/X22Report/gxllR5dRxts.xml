  <text start="1355.34" dur="6.84">being set up now very interestingly</text>
  <text start="1358.69" dur="6.45">remember when the San Francisco and the</text>
  <text start="1362.18" dur="6.72">Board of Supervisors they decided to</text>
  <text start="1365.14" dur="6.13">declare the NRA as a domestic terrorist</text>

  <text start="1378.74" dur="4.02">declaring it a domestic terrorist</text>
  <text start="1380.78" dur="5.64">organization and this is what the NRA</text>
  <text start="1382.76" dur="5.52">argued regrettably this court to must</text>
  <text start="1386.42" dur="4.05">step in to instruct elected officials</text>
  <text start="1388.28" dur="4.68">that freedom of speech means you cannot</text>
  <text start="1390.47" dur="6.87">silence or punish those with whom you</text>
  <text start="1392.96" dur="7.2">disagree they went on to say therefore</text>
  <text start="1397.34" dur="5.82">the resolutions terrorist designation is</text>
  <text start="1400.16" dur="5.36">a frivolous insult but San Francisco</text>
  <text start="1403.16" dur="5.61">actions pose a non-frivolous</text>
  <text start="1405.52" dur="5.74">constitutional threat and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>

  <text start="1422.75" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this all plays out</text>
  <text start="1424.73" dur="4.8">and I do believe the NRA has the upper</text>

  <text start="1429.53" dur="5.55">how this all plays out now we have</text>
  <text start="1432.05" dur="6.09">always known that Trump keeps people in</text>
  <text start="1435.08" dur="5.97">positions for specific reasons and once</text>
  <text start="1438.14" dur="5.43">he doesn&amp;#39;t need them anymore he gets rid</text>
  <text start="1441.05" dur="4.1">of them think about this for a second we</text>
  <text start="1443.57" dur="4.11">mentioned this many many times before</text>
  <text start="1445.15" dur="5.38">when everyone said oh look at Bolton</text>

  <text start="1473.21" dur="4.95">what we want to happen Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="1476.12" dur="4.26">something not just Trump himself but</text>
  <text start="1478.16" dur="4.31">Trump in the end is and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="1480.38" dur="5.779">they&amp;#39;re doing something completely</text>
  <text start="1482.47" dur="6.24">different they&amp;#39;re working out deals that</text>
  <text start="1486.159" dur="6.871">Bolton and those other individuals have</text>
  <text start="1488.71" dur="8.55">no knowledge of they&amp;#39;re keeping the</text>
  <text start="1493.03" dur="7.649">cover story out there while in the</text>
  <text start="1497.26" dur="8.97">background the real work is being done</text>
  <text start="1500.679" dur="7.11">and Trump decided to fire Bolton he</text>

  <text start="1514.03" dur="4.29">many of his suggestions and as did</text>
  <text start="1516.7" dur="3.089">others in the administration and</text>
  <text start="1518.32" dur="3.45">therefore I asked John for his</text>

  <text start="1541.48" dur="3.809">said I was gonna resign and then Trump</text>
  <text start="1543.25" dur="3.57">said wait which I believe Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1545.289" dur="3.26">version more so than bowling because</text>
  <text start="1546.82" dur="4.41">Bolton is a liar</text>
  <text start="1548.549" dur="6.37">we know that Trump kept in there on</text>
  <text start="1551.23" dur="7.04">purpose the question is why is he</text>
  <text start="1554.919" dur="6.811">letting go now does that mean something</text>
  <text start="1558.27" dur="5.139">has been completed because when we go</text>
  <text start="1561.73" dur="4.53">back in time and we look at McMasters</text>
  <text start="1563.409" dur="5.281">who was there during North Korea who was</text>
  <text start="1566.26" dur="4.08">saying that we&amp;#39;re going to invade Trump</text>

  <text start="1589.419" dur="5.49">been there for quite a while do you</text>
  <text start="1592.09" dur="7.2">think the deal with Iran is now complete</text>
  <text start="1594.909" dur="9.091">and Trump doesn&amp;#39;t need Bolton anymore</text>
  <text start="1599.29" dur="7.65">I believe that is what happened and I do</text>
  <text start="1604" dur="6">believe that Trump has full control now</text>
  <text start="1606.94" dur="4.8">and doesn&amp;#39;t need Bolton out there for</text>
  <text start="1610" dur="5.82">optics just like he didn&amp;#39;t need</text>
