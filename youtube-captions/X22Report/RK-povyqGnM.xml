  <text start="58.51" dur="6.78">episode 1641 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="62.23" dur="5.55">August 17th 2018 and the tot of the</text>
  <text start="65.29" dur="5.72">episode is the establishment is now</text>
  <text start="67.78" dur="5.55">pushing the economic recession agenda</text>
  <text start="71.01" dur="5.26">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="73.33" dur="4.86">financial news well it looks like the</text>
  <text start="76.27" dur="6">time has come where the establishment is</text>
  <text start="78.19" dur="6.42">going full throttle on saying that the</text>
  <text start="82.27" dur="5.55">economy is headed towards a recession</text>
  <text start="84.61" dur="4.92">and it&amp;#39;s because of the tariffs and it</text>
  <text start="87.82" dur="3.689">looks like through the corporate media</text>
  <text start="89.53" dur="5.16">as we know they&amp;#39;re gonna continually</text>
  <text start="91.509" dur="5.791">push this idea now this has been planned</text>
  <text start="94.69" dur="5.49">from the start we know that certain</text>
  <text start="97.3" dur="5.34">mainstream media outlets put out that by</text>
  <text start="100.18" dur="3.84">2020 the economy will be in a recession</text>
  <text start="102.64" dur="3.54">now we need to remember something very</text>
  <text start="104.02" dur="6.06">very important we&amp;#39;ve been tracking this</text>
  <text start="106.18" dur="7.62">economy since 2008 and we know that this</text>
  <text start="110.08" dur="6.27">entire system never recovered we know</text>
  <text start="113.8" dur="4.89">that it was built up on an illusion we</text>
  <text start="116.35" dur="5.1">know that the numbers like GDP</text>
  <text start="118.69" dur="6.06">unemployment and the rest they have been</text>
  <text start="121.45" dur="6.029">manipulated to make you think a certain</text>
  <text start="124.75" dur="4.259">way to make you think that the economy</text>
  <text start="127.479" dur="3.811">is improving it&amp;#39;s getting better and</text>
  <text start="129.009" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s very easy to change statistics</text>
  <text start="131.29" dur="4.38">numbers that we see today are the same</text>
  <text start="133.599" dur="3.931">numbers that we saw back in 2008 they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="135.67" dur="4.08">using the same exact calculations and</text>
  <text start="137.53" dur="5.52">all we&amp;#39;re doing is pushing this to the</text>
  <text start="139.75" dur="5.04">extreme now Trump and the Patriots what</text>
  <text start="143.05" dur="4.04">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re trying to show</text>
  <text start="144.79" dur="5.04">using the same method that they used</text>
  <text start="147.09" dur="5.38">that the economy&amp;#39;s doing a lot better</text>
  <text start="149.83" dur="5.39">what they want the central bank&amp;#39;s to do</text>
  <text start="152.47" dur="6.15">is they want them to raise the rates and</text>
  <text start="155.22" dur="6.97">unwind faster and faster this will bring</text>
  <text start="158.62" dur="6.18">the system down what the central bank</text>
  <text start="162.19" dur="4.53">and the establishment want they want the</text>
  <text start="164.8" dur="4.98">system to come down so they can blame it</text>
  <text start="166.72" dur="5.129">on Trump now what&amp;#39;s happening here is we</text>
  <text start="169.78" dur="4.47">can see from many different indicators</text>
  <text start="171.849" dur="4.441">that things are rapidly falling apart</text>
  <text start="174.25" dur="3.75">and it&amp;#39;s not because of the tariffs or</text>
  <text start="176.29" dur="3.99">things like that has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="178" dur="6.06">that the economy again is built on a</text>
  <text start="180.28" dur="6.33">house of cards and it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="184.06" dur="2.85">wobble and it&amp;#39;s going to come down it</text>
  <text start="186.61" dur="2.52">was</text>
  <text start="186.91" dur="4.17">never built on a foundation that can</text>
  <text start="189.13" dur="4.47">support what is going on here</text>
  <text start="191.08" dur="5.07">that is the main problem now Trump knew</text>
  <text start="193.6" dur="6.24">this when he came into office before the</text>
  <text start="196.15" dur="5.31">campaign while he was in office he he</text>
  <text start="199.84" dur="4.14">understands he realized he was briefed</text>
  <text start="201.46" dur="5.64">on it he knows that the economy is not</text>
  <text start="203.98" dur="5.13">strong and he knows that this system</text>
  <text start="207.1" dur="4.14">cannot continue the way it is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="209.11" dur="4.95">completely impossible it&amp;#39;s a central</text>
  <text start="211.24" dur="5.58">bank system which they designed to</text>
  <text start="214.06" dur="6.78">benefit them not the everyday person and</text>
  <text start="216.82" dur="7.28">we&amp;#39;re starting to see cracks in this</text>
  <text start="220.84" dur="6.18">whole entire system now the humic</text>
  <text start="224.1" dur="5.08">sentiment this is dropping very very</text>
  <text start="227.02" dur="4.92">quickly right now and consumers are</text>
  <text start="229.18" dur="5.37">worried now yes you can push the</text>
  <text start="231.94" dur="4.95">statistical numbers up to Heights that</text>
  <text start="234.55" dur="4.02">we&amp;#39;ve never seen before and say the</text>
  <text start="236.89" dur="5.16">economy is doing great everything looks</text>
  <text start="238.57" dur="7.11">great but remember that&amp;#39;s hope that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="242.05" dur="6.96">feeling good but reality always sets in</text>
  <text start="245.68" dur="7.74">because those people know that you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="249.01" dur="5.67">live on hope and feeling good and then</text>
  <text start="253.42" dur="3.51">the people go back to their everyday</text>
  <text start="254.68" dur="3.96">lives of where&amp;#39;s my manufacturing job</text>
  <text start="256.93" dur="5.67">how come I can&amp;#39;t find a full-time job</text>
  <text start="258.64" dur="6.36">and reality then hits home and what</text>
  <text start="262.6" dur="5.1">we&amp;#39;re seeing here is that consumers well</text>
  <text start="265" dur="6.57">they have a drop in confidence about</text>
  <text start="267.7" dur="5.76">major purchases and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="271.57" dur="3.48">we can&amp;#39;t make a major purchase right now</text>
  <text start="273.46" dur="3.209">for a couple of years we don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="275.05" dur="4.77">funds we don&amp;#39;t have the job we&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="276.669" dur="5.881">little bit worried right now and we can</text>
  <text start="279.82" dur="3.99">see this in the data the real hard data</text>
  <text start="282.55" dur="3.3">I&amp;#39;m not talking about the surveys and</text>
  <text start="283.81" dur="6.63">all that other stuff you can see that</text>
  <text start="285.85" dur="8.55">this is actually declining there are</text>
  <text start="290.44" dur="6.18">certain signs that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="294.4" dur="4.41">and there&amp;#39;s many many more that show</text>
  <text start="296.62" dur="4.74">that we are headed towards a bear market</text>
  <text start="298.81" dur="4.23">now we know that the stock market has</text>
  <text start="301.36" dur="3.809">been completely manipulated we know the</text>
  <text start="303.04" dur="4.32">Swiss National Bank has been purchasing</text>
  <text start="305.169" dur="3.75">a lot of the Fang stocks to pump it up</text>
  <text start="307.36" dur="3.72">we know the banks they were receiving</text>
  <text start="308.919" dur="4.261">free money they were pumping up the</text>
  <text start="311.08" dur="4.23">stock market we know the Fed has been</text>
  <text start="313.18" dur="3.96">pumping up the stock market and when you</text>
  <text start="315.31" dur="3.6">look at the stock market it really makes</text>
  <text start="317.14" dur="3.54">no sense whatsoever and they just</text>
  <text start="318.91" dur="4.53">pushing it up because that</text>
  <text start="320.68" dur="4.799">makes everyone feel great but everything</text>
  <text start="323.44" dur="5.009">around the stock market just like in</text>
  <text start="325.479" dur="5.31">2008 it&amp;#39;s all coming down and the last</text>
  <text start="328.449" dur="4.321">thing that comes down is the stock</text>
  <text start="330.789" dur="4.231">market and then people say wow we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="332.77" dur="6.269">a recession no we were in a recession</text>
  <text start="335.02" dur="6.89">way before that that&amp;#39;s just the signal</text>
  <text start="339.039" dur="6.271">to let everyone know that it&amp;#39;s here and</text>
  <text start="341.91" dur="6.97">it allows the mainstream media and the</text>
  <text start="345.31" dur="5.16">Fed to talk about it because they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="348.88" dur="3.87">been planning on this for a while and</text>
  <text start="350.47" dur="5.669">that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now so</text>
  <text start="352.75" dur="6.36">here are some signs that we&amp;#39;re headed</text>
  <text start="356.139" dur="6.15">towards a bear market global stocks have</text>
  <text start="359.11" dur="5.64">now fallen beneath a key moving all key</text>
  <text start="362.289" dur="4.171">moving averages those key moving</text>
  <text start="364.75" dur="5.22">averages are important psychological</text>
  <text start="366.46" dur="6.389">thresholds for investors and if we have</text>
  <text start="369.97" dur="4.68">a few more days like Wednesday we could</text>
  <text start="372.849" dur="5.551">see global financial markets go into</text>

  <text start="378.4" dur="3.84">have now officially entered a bear</text>
  <text start="380.32" dur="5.49">market and all major European stock</text>
  <text start="382.24" dur="7.2">indexes are now red for the year global</text>
  <text start="385.81" dur="5.789">banking stocks are down a whopping 23%</text>
  <text start="389.44" dur="4.92">from the peak established earlier this</text>
  <text start="391.599" dur="5.961">year that means that they have</text>
  <text start="394.36" dur="7.2">officially entered a bear market</text>
  <text start="397.56" dur="6.55">emerging market stocks have fallen 20%</text>
  <text start="401.56" dur="6.389">from the peak and that means that they</text>
  <text start="404.11" dur="6.899">are also in a bear market when demand</text>
  <text start="407.949" dur="5.671">for industrial metals Falls that</text>
  <text start="411.009" dur="5.461">indicates that an economic slowdown is</text>
  <text start="413.62" dur="4.019">coming on Wednesday prices for</text>
  <text start="416.47" dur="4.68">industrial metals fell to their lowest</text>
  <text start="417.639" dur="7.411">level in almost a year if the financial</text>
  <text start="421.15" dur="6.63">carnage continues and that is a big if</text>
  <text start="425.05" dur="4.29">this could be the beginning of another</text>
  <text start="427.78" dur="3.93">financial crisis like we like we</text>
  <text start="429.34" dur="5.88">experienced in 2008 but it would be much</text>
  <text start="431.71" dur="6.81">much worse because this whole system was</text>
  <text start="435.22" dur="6.06">built on an illusion and this would go</text>
  <text start="438.52" dur="4.23">globally and the whole system is going</text>
  <text start="441.28" dur="4.259">to come down now we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>

  <text start="650.74" dur="6.43">globally all the people into as much</text>
  <text start="654.23" dur="5.13">debt as they possibly could why do they</text>

  <text start="673.97" dur="7.32">credit cards are charging you know 18%</text>
  <text start="676.52" dur="6.33">20% 30% I mean if you didn&amp;#39;t hook this</text>

  <text start="686.6" dur="4.44">sharking I mean if you really want to</text>
  <text start="688.94" dur="3.63">think of it that way but if you hook it</text>
