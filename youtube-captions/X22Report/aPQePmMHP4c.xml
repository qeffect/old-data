  <text start="270.099" dur="5.281">the mainstream media who&amp;#39;ve been trying</text>
  <text start="273.55" dur="3">to push a recession remember in the</text>
  <text start="275.38" dur="2.94">beginning phases because they were</text>
  <text start="276.55" dur="3.27">trying to raise the rates and they were</text>
  <text start="278.32" dur="4.23">gonna try to bring down the economic</text>
  <text start="279.82" dur="4.89">system blame it on Trump then we had the</text>
  <text start="282.55" dur="5.1">central bankers out there blaming the</text>
  <text start="284.71" dur="4.98">trade wars and the tariffs saying that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="287.65" dur="3.66">gonna bring down the entire system</text>

  <text start="291.31" dur="5.94">talking about that in just a</text>

  <text start="297.25" dur="9.21">going to be a recession and it was going</text>
  <text start="302.56" dur="7.77">to happen in the year 2020 now they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="314.13" dur="10.02">he made it&amp;#39;s not signed yet but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="318.85" dur="8.1">an agreement that phase one is done and</text>
  <text start="324.15" dur="8.5">there&amp;#39;s going to be no additional</text>
  <text start="326.95" dur="8.19">tariffs hmm very interesting and as they</text>
  <text start="332.65" dur="7.35">move forward he&amp;#39;s going to reduce</text>
  <text start="335.14" dur="5.73">tariffs remember timing is very very</text>
  <text start="340" dur="5.81">important</text>
  <text start="340.87" dur="7.98">why did Trump push this the way he did</text>
  <text start="345.81" dur="6.19">why did he walk away because he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="348.85" dur="6.06">want it to happen too soon he wanted it</text>
  <text start="352" dur="5.46">to happen by the end of this year wait</text>
  <text start="354.91" dur="4.05">until we see what happens next year but</text>
  <text start="357.46" dur="5.79">this is coming out of the Washington</text>

  <text start="363.25" dur="6.12">recession fears in striking turnaround</text>
  <text start="366.1" dur="7.14">since August so everything just turned</text>
  <text start="369.37" dur="5.79">around and this is what it says the US</text>
  <text start="373.24" dur="4.17">economy is heading into 2020 at a pace</text>
  <text start="375.16" dur="4.29">of steady sustained growth after a</text>
  <text start="377.41" dur="4.379">series of interest rate cuts and the</text>
  <text start="379.45" dur="5.279">apparent resolution of two trade related</text>
  <text start="381.789" dur="8.701">threats mostly eliminated the risk of a</text>
  <text start="384.729" dur="9.631">recession once again Trump is using all</text>
  <text start="390.49" dur="5.67">their weapons against them now remember</text>
  <text start="394.36" dur="4.44">there were economists out there</text>
  <text start="396.16" dur="4.98">Financial pundits saying if Trump does</text>
  <text start="398.8" dur="7.739">this the entire system is going to come</text>
  <text start="401.14" dur="8.339">down yes eventually it will but we all</text>
  <text start="406.539" dur="5.491">know how this works we know it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="409.479" dur="5.671">illusion we know that the drug will keep</text>
  <text start="412.03" dur="5.1">the system going long enough and you</text>
  <text start="415.15" dur="5.13">really think Trump is gonna just bring</text>
  <text start="417.13" dur="7.43">down the system and let it crash on his</text>
  <text start="420.28" dur="8.54">watch no what is he doing right now</text>
  <text start="424.56" dur="8.02">he&amp;#39;s building the new economic system a</text>
  <text start="428.82" dur="5.98">system without a central bank a system</text>
  <text start="432.58" dur="5.91">where the United States is energy</text>
  <text start="434.8" dur="7.8">independent a system that has a</text>
  <text start="438.49" dur="6.54">manufacturing base a system that can go</text>
  <text start="442.6" dur="4.86">up against the central bank globalist</text>
  <text start="445.03" dur="3.8">system that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s doing now think</text>
  <text start="447.46" dur="4.079">about the brexit right now</text>
  <text start="448.83" dur="6.67">think about what happened with borz</text>
  <text start="451.539" dur="7.141">johnson q confirmed that this is exactly</text>
  <text start="455.5" dur="7.05">what needed to happen Boris Johnson is</text>
  <text start="458.68" dur="7.64">going to push a brexit deal they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="462.55" dur="3.77">going to separate themselves from the EU</text>
  <text start="466.349" dur="6.94">Trump and Boris Johnson are going to</text>
  <text start="469.33" dur="7.41">make a trade deal now let&amp;#39;s step back</text>
  <text start="473.289" dur="8.521">for a second we have the u.s. MCA Canada</text>
  <text start="476.74" dur="8.91">Mexico the United States ad in the UK</text>
  <text start="481.81" dur="9.539">now if we have the UK you know Australia</text>
  <text start="485.65" dur="10.519">is next in line then you have the EU all</text>
  <text start="491.349" dur="9.781">trade is going to go through the UK</text>
  <text start="496.169" dur="7.271">bypassing the EU once other countries</text>
  <text start="501.13" dur="5.039">see how well the UK is doing and how</text>
  <text start="503.44" dur="6.84">well the United States is doing how well</text>
  <text start="506.169" dur="6.18">Canada Mexico are doing what do you</text>
  <text start="510.28" dur="5.4">think the other EU nations are going to</text>
  <text start="512.349" dur="5.401">do did they&amp;#39;re gonna say hey we love it</text>
  <text start="515.68" dur="5.94">with the EU we&amp;#39;re in debt we have</text>
  <text start="517.75" dur="6.51">austerity it&amp;#39;s fantastic we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="521.62" dur="5.63">the same trade deals do you think</text>
  <text start="524.26" dur="8">they&amp;#39;re going to want to leave the EU</text>
  <text start="527.25" dur="8.079">all of this has been put into motion one</text>
  <text start="532.26" dur="8.139">piece of the puzzle builds on the other</text>
  <text start="535.329" dur="9.811">piece and by the people speaking out in</text>
  <text start="540.399" dur="9.18">the UK it allows the entire plan to move</text>
  <text start="545.14" dur="8.47">forward now once we have trade with the</text>
  <text start="549.579" dur="7.991">UK we have the u.s. MCA</text>
  <text start="553.61" dur="9.12">we have Australia working economically</text>
  <text start="557.57" dur="8.88">with trade and manufacturing this will</text>
  <text start="562.73" dur="7.14">put pressure on the globalists system</text>
  <text start="566.45" dur="8.91">what is but Trump is doing he&amp;#39;s setting</text>
  <text start="569.87" dur="8.399">up his own economic system to compete</text>
  <text start="575.36" dur="6.27">and actually to bring down the</text>
  <text start="578.269" dur="5.611">globalists system remember before there</text>
  <text start="581.63" dur="8.84">was only the globalists system that was</text>
  <text start="583.88" dur="10.5">it and now everything is changing and</text>
  <text start="590.47" dur="6.369">once you have control once you have the</text>
  <text start="594.38" dur="5.54">ability to compete against the globalist</text>
  <text start="596.839" dur="6.781">the central bank system that allows you</text>
  <text start="599.92" dur="7.21">to start to march towards bringing down</text>
  <text start="603.62" dur="7.909">the central bank system and this is</text>
  <text start="607.13" dur="9.329">exactly what Trump is doing right now</text>
  <text start="611.529" dur="6.521">this is not to rebuild or to patch or to</text>
  <text start="616.459" dur="5.041">make the central bank system where the</text>
  <text start="618.05" dur="8.7">global system work it&amp;#39;s about removing</text>
  <text start="621.5" dur="8.67">it bringing the economic system back to</text>
  <text start="626.75" dur="7.579">the level of Main Street not to Wall</text>
  <text start="630.17" dur="8.039">Street not to the wealthy speculators</text>
  <text start="634.329" dur="9.491">bringing it back to the people the</text>
  <text start="638.209" dur="9">people drive the system the people need</text>
  <text start="643.82" dur="6.54">jobs and manufacturers we need small</text>
  <text start="647.209" dur="4.891">businesses to drive this system because</text>
  <text start="650.36" dur="4.919">the more people that are employed the</text>
  <text start="652.1" dur="7.08">more money you&amp;#39;re making that drives the</text>
  <text start="655.279" dur="5.881">system this is why he made the u.s. MCA</text>
  <text start="659.18" dur="5.219">without Wall Street and the big</text>
  <text start="661.16" dur="6.84">corporations this is why he made this</text>
  <text start="664.399" dur="6.091">deal the best he could because it was</text>
  <text start="668" dur="4.56">still attached to NAFTA I think</text>
  <text start="670.49" dur="5.039">eventually when everything&amp;#39;s said and</text>
  <text start="672.56" dur="6.12">done I think US MCA will eventually</text>
  <text start="675.529" dur="6.87">completely go away I think this was a</text>
  <text start="678.68" dur="5.73">temporary fix to allow the Patriots to</text>
  <text start="682.399" dur="4.111">have time to have</text>
  <text start="684.41" dur="3.51">a manufacturing base to compete against</text>
  <text start="686.51" dur="3.63">the globalists and the central bank</text>
  <text start="687.92" dur="4.98">system and I think eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="690.14" dur="4.32">going to happen once the United States</text>
  <text start="692.9" dur="5.34">has a lot of the manufacturing back</text>
  <text start="694.46" dur="6.84">deregulate remove taxes remove the</text>
  <text start="698.24" dur="8.43">central bank system a lot of what we see</text>
  <text start="701.3" dur="8.63">today won&amp;#39;t even exist just like you</text>
  <text start="706.67" dur="7.97">heard of the TPP doesn&amp;#39;t exist anymore</text>
  <text start="709.93" dur="9.72">NAFTA won&amp;#39;t exist at all the u.s. MCA</text>
  <text start="714.64" dur="8.2">most likely will go to the wayside</text>
  <text start="719.65" dur="5.08">everything that the globalists the</text>
  <text start="722.84" dur="5.49">central banks have put into place will</text>
  <text start="724.73" dur="6.57">completely disappear we&amp;#39;re entering a</text>
