  <text start="101.46" dur="6.6">financial news now on Friday we saw the</text>
  <text start="105.03" dur="6.36">market come down it was like 660 so on</text>
  <text start="108.06" dur="5.49">points and everyone is looking at this</text>
  <text start="111.39" dur="4.769">you know saying wow look how quickly</text>
  <text start="113.55" dur="5.04">that drop we also see the cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="116.159" dur="6.121">market where Bitcoin dropped quite</text>
  <text start="118.59" dur="5.79">quickly also now the thing is when the</text>
  <text start="122.28" dur="4.92">crash hits when everything starts to</text>
  <text start="124.38" dur="4.41">fall apart it&amp;#39;s going to come down very</text>
  <text start="127.2" dur="4.05">very fast and people aren&amp;#39;t going to</text>
  <text start="128.79" dur="3.93">know what&amp;#39;s going on yes it looks great</text>
  <text start="131.25" dur="3.51">when it&amp;#39;s being pushed up</text>
  <text start="132.72" dur="4.68">everyone thinks that it could never end</text>
  <text start="134.76" dur="5.55">but all of a sudden with a snap of a</text>
  <text start="137.4" dur="4.92">finger things can change and this is a</text>
  <text start="140.31" dur="5.31">warning to everyone that things can</text>
  <text start="142.32" dur="7.77">change very very rapidly now this was a</text>
  <text start="145.62" dur="10.32">very tiny small drop but just coming</text>
  <text start="150.09" dur="9.36">down 660 points there was 68 point five</text>
  <text start="155.94" dur="6.96">billion that was lost to the very very</text>
  <text start="159.45" dur="6.81">wealthy and yes is this a lot of money</text>
  <text start="162.9" dur="5.49">no but what we can see is when the</text>
  <text start="166.26" dur="3.15">market comes down and it comes down hard</text>
  <text start="168.39" dur="2.129">and those people who aren&amp;#39;t in the</text>
  <text start="169.41" dur="3.359">inside who are shorting the market</text>
  <text start="170.519" dur="3.931">they&amp;#39;re gonna lose a lot of money now a</text>
  <text start="172.769" dur="4.261">lot of people out there say well I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="174.45" dur="5.4">really care I&amp;#39;m not in the market it</text>
  <text start="177.03" dur="4.17">doesn&amp;#39;t affect me there&amp;#39;s I don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="179.85" dur="3.78">if it goes up I don&amp;#39;t care if it goes</text>
  <text start="181.2" dur="4.8">down but for those people who are</text>
  <text start="183.63" dur="4.95">working in companies</text>
  <text start="186" dur="6.12">the stock market reflects how the</text>
  <text start="188.58" dur="6.15">company is doing and allows the company</text>
  <text start="192.12" dur="4.92">to continue on the way it is even though</text>
  <text start="194.73" dur="6.48">it&amp;#39;s illusionary when the market comes</text>
  <text start="197.04" dur="7.47">down it gives corporations an excuse to</text>
  <text start="201.21" dur="6.03">start laying off people to shut plants</text>
  <text start="204.51" dur="6.24">to shut certain departments down and</text>
  <text start="207.24" dur="6.09">this is what corporations use to what</text>
  <text start="210.75" dur="4.98">they call restructure or to minimize</text>
  <text start="213.33" dur="5.22">costs and things like that so even</text>
  <text start="215.73" dur="6.12">though you&amp;#39;re not invested in the stock</text>
  <text start="218.55" dur="5.85">market this is a way where it&amp;#39;s the end</text>
  <text start="221.85" dur="4.5">of the economic cycle where the stock</text>
  <text start="224.4" dur="4.05">market is the Flair that is shot up into</text>
  <text start="226.35" dur="3.66">the sky to let everyone know because</text>
  <text start="228.45" dur="3.9">everyone follows the stock market that</text>
  <text start="230.01" dur="4.98">the economy has turned down even though</text>
  <text start="232.35" dur="5.43">the economy has turned down way way</text>
  <text start="234.99" dur="5.1">before this it allows the companies the</text>
  <text start="237.78" dur="4.35">excuse to start laying off people and</text>
  <text start="240.09" dur="4.17">even though you&amp;#39;re not invested in the</text>
  <text start="242.13" dur="6.09">market guess what you could lose your</text>
  <text start="244.26" dur="6.72">job plants can close pensions declined</text>
  <text start="248.22" dur="6.269">there&amp;#39;s a lot that goes on with this and</text>
  <text start="250.98" dur="5.189">this is why they keep the market up up</text>
  <text start="254.489" dur="3.81">to a certain point and then they&amp;#39;re able</text>
  <text start="256.169" dur="4.651">to drop it at a certain point because</text>
  <text start="258.299" dur="6.571">they can affect a lot of different areas</text>
  <text start="260.82" dur="6.09">and allow corporations to restructure</text>
  <text start="264.87" dur="4.74">cut their costs because they know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="266.91" dur="4.74">one gigantic illusion and even maybe</text>
  <text start="269.61" dur="3.84">have bailouts and we&amp;#39;ve seen this in the</text>
  <text start="271.65" dur="4.59">past now what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="273.45" dur="6.66">all of this is that this is looking very</text>
  <text start="276.24" dur="5.97">much like 2008 and we have to say that</text>
  <text start="280.11" dur="5.67">Friday&amp;#39;s market plunge marked the start</text>
  <text start="282.21" dur="6.06">of the next crash economic and market</text>
  <text start="285.78" dur="5.88">conditions are very very similar</text>
  <text start="288.27" dur="5.55">to late 2007 early 2008 remember back</text>
  <text start="291.66" dur="4.05">then everything was going great home</text>
  <text start="293.82" dur="4.349">prices were soaring jobs were plentiful</text>
  <text start="295.71" dur="4.32">the great cultural marketing machine was</text>
  <text start="298.169" dur="4.741">busy proclaiming that new era permanent</text>
  <text start="300.03" dur="4.889">prosperity had gone thanks to the steady</text>
  <text start="302.91" dur="5.16">leadership of Alan Greenspan and then</text>
  <text start="304.919" dur="5.25">Ben Bernanke and of course the financial</text>
  <text start="308.07" dur="5.909">crisis arrived in late 2008 even though</text>
  <text start="310.169" dur="5.341">prior to 2008 that crash when it came in</text>
  <text start="313.979" dur="3.151">October they were telling us they</text>
  <text start="315.51" dur="3.689">weren&amp;#39;t forecasting a recession</text>
  <text start="317.13" dur="4.11">everything is contained</text>
  <text start="319.199" dur="5.791">there&amp;#39;s no problems housing does not go</text>
  <text start="321.24" dur="6.149">down everything was great and they were</text>
  <text start="324.99" dur="3.989">raising the rates all throughout this</text>
  <text start="327.389" dur="3.39">period of time and they realized when</text>
  <text start="328.979" dur="3.18">they hit a certain area things started</text>
  <text start="330.779" dur="5.01">to fall apart so they dropped the rates</text>
  <text start="332.159" dur="6.901">and ben bernanke drop interest rates to</text>
  <text start="335.789" dur="6.66">1% this provided an unprecedented</text>
  <text start="339.06" dur="7.319">incentive for investors institutions to</text>
  <text start="342.449" dur="6.541">borrow igniting a massive housing bubble</text>
  <text start="346.379" dur="6.66">as well as an outsized equity and bond</text>
  <text start="348.99" dur="6.179">gains they did this on purpose and this</text>
  <text start="353.039" dur="4.921">is coming from Chris Martenson from Peak</text>
  <text start="355.169" dur="5.67">prosperity saying that this is very</text>
  <text start="357.96" dur="5.609">similar to what happened in 2008</text>
  <text start="360.839" dur="4.471">now it&amp;#39;s worth taking a moment to</text>
  <text start="363.569" dur="3.6">understand the mechanism the Federal</text>
  <text start="365.31" dur="5.52">Reserve used back then to lower interest</text>
  <text start="367.169" dur="6.691">rates it did so by flooding the banking</text>
  <text start="370.83" dur="3.989">system with enough liquidity and of</text>
  <text start="373.86" dur="3.239">course this is done through</text>
  <text start="374.819" dur="4.41">electronically printed digital currency</text>
  <text start="377.099" dur="4.29">units until all the banks felt</text>
  <text start="379.229" dur="3.87">comfortable lending or borrowing from</text>
  <text start="381.389" dur="5.34">each other at an average rate of about</text>
  <text start="383.099" dur="5.94">1% the knock-on effect of flooding the</text>
  <text start="386.729" dur="4.05">US banking system in this way creating</text>
  <text start="389.039" dur="3.3">an echo bubble to replace the one</text>
  <text start="390.779" dur="5.04">created early during an Alan Greenspan</text>
  <text start="392.339" dur="6.69">tenure known as the dot-com bubble now</text>
  <text start="395.819" dur="4.62">when we look at this we can see how they</text>
  <text start="399.029" dur="4.831">have created their bubbles because we</text>
  <text start="400.439" dur="5.25">could see this huge surge and it reaches</text>
  <text start="403.86" dur="4.169">the top and then everything drops off</text>
  <text start="405.689" dur="5.551">again we saw that back in the dot-com</text>
  <text start="408.029" dur="6.45">era then we saw the echo bubble and here</text>
  <text start="411.24" dur="6.539">we are where where twice as high as we</text>
  <text start="414.479" dur="6">were from the other prior two bubbles</text>
  <text start="417.779" dur="4.35">and it tells us something is going on</text>
  <text start="420.479" dur="5.97">here and we know what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="422.129" dur="7.47">it&amp;#39;s one gigantic illusion now the</text>
  <text start="426.449" dur="5.27">warning signs in 2007 were abundant and</text>
  <text start="429.599" dur="6.9">for most completely obvious in hindsight</text>
  <text start="431.719" dur="6.91">again when you&amp;#39;re in 2007 in 2008</text>
  <text start="436.499" dur="3.57">you&amp;#39;re really not seeing it because</text>
  <text start="438.629" dur="2.94">again you&amp;#39;re here in the corporate media</text>
  <text start="440.069" dur="3.21">you&amp;#39;re here in the central bank and</text>
  <text start="441.569" dur="4.981">everyone thinks that this is going to</text>
  <text start="443.279" dur="5.73">continue on forever and when we look</text>
  <text start="446.55" dur="5.28">back we see that yes there were many</text>
  <text start="449.009" dur="3.96">many signs and there are many peril</text>
  <text start="451.83" dur="4.999">features</text>
  <text start="452.969" dur="8.88">that we see today - going back to</text>
  <text start="456.829" dur="7.84">2007-2008 now in 2007 people were</text>
  <text start="461.849" dur="5.61">borrowing heavily against their rising</text>
  <text start="464.669" dur="5.93">home prices today we have record</text>
  <text start="467.459" dur="6.3">household debt record auto loan balances</text>
  <text start="470.599" dur="7.35">record corporate debt and a record</text>
  <text start="473.759" dur="6.27">sovereign bomb debt in 2007 the Fed was</text>
  <text start="477.949" dur="4.03">carefully raising the rates to see if</text>
  <text start="480.029" dur="6.39">they could build up an interest rate</text>
  <text start="481.979" dur="7.41">buffer today we also have rising rates</text>
  <text start="486.419" dur="6.51">and declining market liquidity due to</text>
  <text start="489.389" dur="6.81">reduced central bank QE activity now the</text>
  <text start="492.929" dur="6.181">raising rates today it&amp;#39;s not exactly the</text>
  <text start="496.199" dur="6">same as it was in 2007 now unlike the</text>
  <text start="499.11" dur="5.069">mechanism the Fed used in 2007 today</text>
  <text start="502.199" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s not driving interest rates higher</text>
  <text start="504.179" dur="4.98">by withdrawing liquidity instead it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="506.369" dur="5.1">doing so by simply offering a rate of</text>
  <text start="509.159" dur="5.1">interest to banks on their excess</text>
  <text start="511.469" dur="6.24">reserves and that drags the overall rate</text>
  <text start="514.259" dur="5.01">of interest up why because if you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="517.709" dur="3.541">bank and you have the choice between</text>
  <text start="519.269" dur="4.5">either lending overnight to another bank</text>
  <text start="521.25" dur="4.199">or lending money to the Fed then you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="523.769" dur="4.711">going to take the best deal right now</text>
  <text start="525.449" dur="6.81">the Fed is offering a pretty darn sweet</text>
  <text start="528.48" dur="5.969">deal and we can see this with the chart</text>
  <text start="532.259" dur="4.95">we can see that interest rates on excess</text>
  <text start="534.449" dur="3.87">reserves are moving up and if we go back</text>
  <text start="537.209" dur="4.38">to 2016</text>
  <text start="538.319" dur="7.95">it was around point zero four and today</text>
  <text start="541.589" dur="7.891">in 2018 it&amp;#39;s around 1.5 now without this</text>
  <text start="546.269" dur="6.271">little feature and by the way this was</text>
  <text start="549.48" dur="4.74">authorized by Congress back in 2008 the</text>
  <text start="552.54" dur="3.93">Fed would have to drain many hundreds of</text>
  <text start="554.22" dur="5.07">billions of dollars from their system to</text>
  <text start="556.47" dur="5.099">hike interest as instead now they can</text>
  <text start="559.29" dur="4.56">just set the interest to banks on their</text>
  <text start="561.569" dur="5.13">excess reserves higher as if it were</text>
  <text start="563.85" dur="5.9">magic dial that sets the price of money</text>
  <text start="566.699" dur="6.481">it&amp;#39;s pretty darn cool trick but its</text>
  <text start="569.75" dur="6.699">newness prevents us from looking to past</text>
  <text start="573.18" dur="5.519">interest hiking cycles for clues as to</text>
  <text start="576.449" dur="4.801">how this current one will play out</text>
  <text start="578.699" dur="4.651">because the dynamics are totally</text>
  <text start="581.25" dur="4.47">different now the Fed is starting to</text>
  <text start="583.35" dur="3.419">drain liquidity from the system it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="585.72" dur="4.039">using a process</text>
  <text start="586.769" dur="5.701">whereas reducing its balance sheet on</text>
  <text start="589.759" dur="4.961">that front we see that the Fed has</text>
  <text start="592.47" dur="5.19">allowed some 30 billion of Treasuries to</text>
  <text start="594.72" dur="5.25">roll over on its balance sheets this</text>
  <text start="597.66" dur="4.769">simply means that when these instrument</text>
  <text start="599.97" dur="5.01">instruments mature the Treasury</text>
  <text start="602.429" dur="4.71">Department returned the principal to the</text>
  <text start="604.98" dur="3.99">Fed instead of seeing the Fed replaced</text>
  <text start="607.139" dur="3.781">the bonds by printing up more money to</text>
  <text start="608.97" dur="4.789">buy more of the same securities at the</text>
  <text start="610.92" dur="5.819">next treasury auction so here we are</text>
  <text start="613.759" dur="4.721">nine years into the recovery and the</text>
  <text start="616.739" dur="5.4">central bank&amp;#39;s printed the largest</text>
  <text start="618.48" dur="5.87">amount of emergency money ever so are we</text>
  <text start="622.139" dur="4.89">still experiencing an emergency of</text>
  <text start="624.35" dur="5.199">historically unprecedented magnitude or</text>
  <text start="627.029" dur="5.22">are we years into a joying</text>
  <text start="629.549" dur="5.79">a robust recovery as the corporate media</text>
  <text start="632.249" dur="7.25">is trying to convince us of as the Fed</text>
  <text start="635.339" dur="7.771">is trying to convince us of which is it</text>
  <text start="639.499" dur="7.18">well the markets cannot withstand any</text>
  <text start="643.11" dur="6.81">reduction in stimulus if the projected</text>
  <text start="646.679" dur="5.041">tightening actually occurs asset prices</text>
  <text start="649.92" dur="4.519">will begin to fall violently in response</text>
  <text start="651.72" dur="5.279">when that occurs all the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="654.439" dur="6.01">promised plans will be tossed in the</text>
  <text start="656.999" dur="5.611">trash the ensuing rescue efforts will</text>
  <text start="660.449" dur="3.901">unleash a tidal wave of liquidity that</text>
  <text start="662.61" dur="4.229">will dwarf the efforts of the past</text>
  <text start="664.35" dur="4.56">decade and very likely destroy the</text>
  <text start="666.839" dur="4.831">remaining purchase power of the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="668.91" dur="6.149">major Phi Act currencies so to allow the</text>
  <text start="671.67" dur="5.159">central banks to do all this what</text>
  <text start="675.059" dur="4.44">happens what needs to happen first well</text>
  <text start="676.829" dur="5.07">the markets need to fall very very hard</text>
  <text start="679.499" dur="5.34">this will allow the central banks enough</text>
  <text start="681.899" dur="5.67">political air cover to do their drastic</text>
  <text start="684.839" dur="6.48">action of pushing the interest rates</text>
  <text start="687.569" dur="6.51">back down creating more stimulus because</text>
  <text start="691.319" dur="5.76">they know that this is not going to work</text>
  <text start="694.079" dur="5.25">and we&amp;#39;re probably going to see that Dow</text>
  <text start="697.079" dur="5.37">closed between 500 to a thousand points</text>
  <text start="699.329" dur="5.73">in a single day just like today and</text>
  <text start="702.449" dur="6.39">we&amp;#39;re gonna see this happen more often</text>
  <text start="705.059" dur="7.051">and once again this could be the</text>
  <text start="708.839" dur="7.771">beginning of the economic crisis and</text>
  <text start="712.11" dur="7.099">like we said in Prior reports minuchin</text>
  <text start="716.61" dur="3.96">was out there and he was pushing a</text>
  <text start="719.209" dur="3.851">weaker dollar</text>
  <text start="720.57" dur="4.38">which I believe he nudged the world to</text>
  <text start="723.06" dur="3.33">think that this is the approach the</text>
  <text start="724.95" dur="3.72">United States has taken even though</text>
  <text start="726.39" dur="4.26">there&amp;#39;s agreements with other central</text>
  <text start="728.67" dur="3.69">banks saying that the US would never do</text>
  <text start="730.65" dur="4.26">this and I think this was pushed out</text>
  <text start="732.36" dur="5.42">there on purpose to try to start the</text>
  <text start="734.91" dur="4.71">avalanche of the system coming down and</text>
  <text start="737.78" dur="3.85">here we are today</text>
  <text start="739.62" dur="3.96">where we&amp;#39;re seeing that things are</text>
  <text start="741.63" dur="4.26">rapidly changing now I&amp;#39;m not saying that</text>
  <text start="743.58" dur="4.77">the markets gonna come down another five</text>
  <text start="745.89" dur="4.32">hundred to a thousand points coming up</text>
  <text start="748.35" dur="3.93">this week most likely it will probably</text>
  <text start="750.21" dur="5.1">shoot back up because remember the</text>
  <text start="752.28" dur="7.92">central banks they don&amp;#39;t push their</text>
  <text start="755.31" dur="9.69">agenda unless their plan is ready to go</text>
  <text start="760.2" dur="6.6">and they need to blame they need to have</text>
  <text start="765" dur="4.32">the news come out that there are</text>
  <text start="766.8" dur="4.89">problems in the economy they need all of</text>
  <text start="769.32" dur="4.59">this to happen before they start doing</text>
  <text start="771.69" dur="5.91">so what they do in the beginning is they</text>
  <text start="773.91" dur="6.03">begin their entire process they push the</text>
  <text start="777.6" dur="3.96">news out in the corporate media they</text>
  <text start="779.94" dur="4.86">push their news about a weaker dollar</text>
  <text start="781.56" dur="5.49">and they head down this path and you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="784.8" dur="4.29">hear more and more news come out and of</text>
  <text start="787.05" dur="3.6">course we might even see Trump trying to</text>
  <text start="789.09" dur="3.57">correct what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="790.65" dur="3.6">because remember there is a fight of who</text>
  <text start="792.66" dur="3.48">is going to bring down the economy now</text>
  <text start="794.25" dur="3.57">on one hand the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="796.14" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t care about the people just like</text>
  <text start="797.82" dur="4.02">look at the past they&amp;#39;ll bring it down</text>
  <text start="799.86" dur="3.87">hard and fast they don&amp;#39;t care how many</text>
  <text start="801.84" dur="4.08">people are hurt they don&amp;#39;t care how many</text>
  <text start="803.73" dur="5.13">people lose their wealth because their</text>
  <text start="805.92" dur="3.96">idea is profit their idea is take the</text>
  <text start="808.86" dur="2.88">wealth from the people when them</text>
  <text start="809.88" dur="4.11">everything crashes buy things up on</text>
  <text start="811.74" dur="5.34">penny on the dollar and this is what</text>
  <text start="813.99" dur="4.95">they do on the other hand we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="817.08" dur="4.59">for a softer transition we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="818.94" dur="6.15">for a softer crash the economy right now</text>
  <text start="821.67" dur="5.13">is falling apart it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what</text>
  <text start="825.09" dur="3.84">the corporate media saying it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="826.8" dur="3.39">matter what the Fed is saying it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="828.93" dur="3.87">matter what anyone is saying because</text>
  <text start="830.19" dur="4.56">they said all of this back prior to 2008</text>
  <text start="832.8" dur="4.95">when the whole system fell apart they</text>
  <text start="834.75" dur="5.43">told us back then that everything was</text>

  <text start="904.509" dur="6.06">making us believe to get us to this</text>
  <text start="907.54" dur="5.12">point because they want everyone all in</text>
