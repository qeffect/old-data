  <text start="86.939" dur="4.71">troubles and you can see that this is</text>
  <text start="89.399" dur="5.461">pretty much increasing as we go</text>
  <text start="91.649" dur="5.341">throughout the year as retail sales are</text>
  <text start="94.86" dur="4.98">completely imploding on themselves and</text>

  <text start="114.329" dur="5.04">loans see a sudden jump in late payments</text>
  <text start="117.899" dur="5.64">and we knew this was going to happen</text>
  <text start="119.369" dur="7.591">because those people who have subprime</text>
  <text start="123.539" dur="5.101">credit can&amp;#39;t find a job or have a</text>
  <text start="126.96" dur="3.63">part-time job they&amp;#39;re getting loans</text>
  <text start="128.64" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re going out to get a car and of</text>
  <text start="130.59" dur="3.45">course they&amp;#39;re saying to themselves let</text>
  <text start="132.18" dur="4.32">me get the car I can go to a job I can</text>
  <text start="134.04" dur="4.38">you know and whatever they&amp;#39;re doing here</text>
  <text start="136.5" dur="4.29">and it&amp;#39;s really starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="138.42" dur="4.59">and a three year</text>
  <text start="140.79" dur="4.08">lending boom to car buyers with spotty</text>
  <text start="143.01" dur="4.08">credit that helped push auto sales to</text>
  <text start="144.87" dur="3.78">six-year high is starting to show signs</text>
  <text start="147.09" dur="4.679">of overheating the percentage of loans</text>
  <text start="148.65" dur="5.669">packed packaged into securities that are</text>
  <text start="151.769" dur="6.75">more than 30 days late rose by one point</text>
  <text start="154.319" dur="6.48">four three percent to 7.5 nine percent</text>
  <text start="158.519" dur="4.711">in the 12 months and deceptive or 30th</text>
  <text start="160.799" dur="4.91">and we can see that this is actually</text>
  <text start="163.23" dur="4.77">getting worse the percentage is</text>
  <text start="165.709" dur="4.12">increasing and we&amp;#39;re going to see this</text>
  <text start="168" dur="3.45">go throughout the year just like we see</text>
  <text start="169.829" dur="4.291">real estate falling apart they were</text>
  <text start="171.45" dur="4.649">giving 0% down or they lower the down</text>
  <text start="174.12" dur="3.449">payments from twenty to twenty-five</text>
  <text start="176.099" dur="2.941">percent down to five percent and they</text>
  <text start="177.569" dur="3.75">loaded the three percent I see some</text>
  <text start="179.04" dur="4.8">places that actually have zero percent</text>
  <text start="181.319" dur="5.191">down one hundred percent financing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="183.84" dur="4.59">seeing it all fall apart people just</text>
  <text start="186.51" dur="5.46">can&amp;#39;t make it today people are having</text>
  <text start="188.43" dur="6.059">troubles finding work and it is just</text>
  <text start="191.97" dur="5.939">falling apart and what we&amp;#39;re seeing now</text>
  <text start="194.489" dur="8.25">is that people are homeless people are</text>
  <text start="197.909" dur="9.181">going hungry and there are 33 US cities</text>
  <text start="202.739" dur="7.291">that say that it is a crime if you feed</text>
  <text start="207.09" dur="5.039">the homeless and you could be fined if</text>
  <text start="210.03" dur="4.379">they catch you feeding the homeless</text>
  <text start="212.129" dur="5.1">person and this is absolutely ridiculous</text>
  <text start="214.409" dur="6.871">and it&amp;#39;s really unbelievable now we</text>
  <text start="217.229" dur="7.73">understand that they&amp;#39;re trying to paint</text>
  <text start="221.28" dur="6.629">a picture of what an anti-government</text>
  <text start="224.959" dur="4.21">homegrown extremists actually looks like</text>
  <text start="227.909" dur="3.36">and this is what they&amp;#39;re using jerod</text>
  <text start="229.169" dur="5.46">Miller for they&amp;#39;re also using it for the</text>
  <text start="231.269" dur="6.71">gun grab that this is a two-pronged</text>
  <text start="234.629" dur="6.121">approach to get those people who are</text>
  <text start="237.979" dur="4.93">conspiracy theorists who are against the</text>
  <text start="240.75" dur="4.5"> of the government who don&amp;#39;t agree</text>
  <text start="242.909" dur="4.561">with the government views and also to</text>
  <text start="245.25" dur="3.93">get those guns and disarm the American</text>
  <text start="247.47" dur="3.269">people that&amp;#39;s what it still what that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="249.18" dur="3.929">what&amp;#39;s happening right now and what</text>
  <text start="250.739" dur="5.041">we&amp;#39;re seeing though in New York right</text>
  <text start="253.109" dur="4.291">now there is a leaked document new york</text>
  <text start="255.78" dur="6.15">state intelligence center the document</text>
  <text start="257.4" dur="6.72">entitled CTB 1407 recent spike in</text>
  <text start="261.93" dur="4.29">violence targeting law enforcement</text>
  <text start="264.12" dur="4.019">details several recent shootings while</text>
  <text start="266.22" dur="4.46">warning police to be on the lookout for</text>
  <text start="268.139" dur="6.181">people displaying anti-government</text>
  <text start="270.68" dur="5.5">viewpoints over the last week there</text>
  <text start="274.32" dur="3.51">three attacks one in Canada and two in</text>
  <text start="276.18" dur="3.24">the united states in which law</text>
  <text start="277.83" dur="3.6">enforcement officers were targeted</text>
  <text start="279.42" dur="4.11">leading to the death of five officers</text>
  <text start="281.43" dur="4.83">and one civilian the bulletin states</text>
  <text start="283.53" dur="4.62">based upon reporting it appears all the</text>
  <text start="286.26" dur="4.68">suspects in these incidents were</text>
  <text start="288.15" dur="5.97">motivated by elements of far-right</text>
  <text start="290.94" dur="5.24">anti-government ideology with a</text>
  <text start="294.12" dur="4.86">particular fixation on law enforcement</text>
  <text start="296.18" dur="5.68">so here we are they&amp;#39;re already starting</text>
  <text start="298.98" dur="4.59">to paint the picture of look out for</text>
  <text start="301.86" dur="3.84">these anti-government people if you hear</text>
  <text start="303.57" dur="4.44">someone speaking about it we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="305.7" dur="6.36">about it and with friends just be on the</text>
  <text start="308.01" dur="6.51">lookout and they might be causing</text>
  <text start="312.06" dur="4.2">problems in the near future and of</text>
  <text start="314.52" dur="4.14">course we have to understand that Eric</text>
  <text start="316.26" dur="4.68">Holder has created the task force for</text>
  <text start="318.66" dur="3.6">finding those homegrown extremists</text>
  <text start="320.94" dur="4.83">domestic terrorists those</text>
  <text start="322.26" dur="6.69">anti-government people and this is all</text>
  <text start="325.77" dur="5.49">starting to really spread now across the</text>
  <text start="328.95" dur="4.17">country and they&amp;#39;re really painting the</text>
  <text start="331.26" dur="4.44">picture and they are getting ready to go</text>
  <text start="333.12" dur="4.47">after these types of people of course I</text>
  <text start="335.7" dur="3.66">am one of them and I guess you people</text>
  <text start="337.59" dur="4.17">who are listening to me you are one of</text>
  <text start="339.36" dur="4.29">these people also because you do have a</text>
  <text start="341.76" dur="4.2">different viewpoint than the government</text>
  <text start="343.65" dur="6.3">and of course the government doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="345.96" dur="6.66">like this whatsoever now out in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="349.95" dur="6.06">what&amp;#39;s happening the the whole situation</text>
  <text start="352.62" dur="6.33">is really intensifying it is getting</text>
  <text start="356.01" dur="5.28">worse poroshenko&amp;#39;s promises so far</text>
  <text start="358.95" dur="5.22">haven&amp;#39;t been coming true and everything</text>
  <text start="361.29" dur="4.89">is really escalating in Ukraine and we</text>
  <text start="364.17" dur="4.14">can see the United States central</text>
  <text start="366.18" dur="4.92">bankers are out there and they are</text>
  <text start="368.31" dur="4.8">really pushing to provoke Russia at this</text>
  <text start="371.1" dur="4.29">time of course we heard news reports</text>
  <text start="373.11" dur="4.83">that you know Russia is bringing tanks</text>
  <text start="375.39" dur="5.01">in to Ukraine and they found like one or</text>
  <text start="377.94" dur="4.47">two or I guess three tanks you know New</text>
  <text start="380.4" dur="4.26">York Times was out there saying that</text>
  <text start="382.41" dur="4.44">Russian sent tanks to separatists in</text>
  <text start="384.66" dur="4.77">Ukraine and I just have to say this out</text>
  <text start="386.85" dur="5.16">of everything that we&amp;#39;ve seen and the</text>
  <text start="389.43" dur="4.92">actions that Putin has done do you</text>
  <text start="392.01" dur="5.52">really think he&amp;#39;s going to send in one</text>
  <text start="394.35" dur="5.76">two three tanks into Ukraine but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="397.53" dur="5.7">very funny is that the United States has</text>
  <text start="400.11" dur="6.75">no problem with Ukraine driving a tank</text>
  <text start="403.23" dur="4.68">over the border into Russia now of</text>
  <text start="406.86" dur="2.85">course</text>
  <text start="407.91" dur="3.54">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="409.71" dur="4.5">New York Times the corporate media they</text>
  <text start="411.45" dur="6.33">are out there saying that yes we have</text>
  <text start="414.21" dur="4.92">fact we have a pictures we know for a</text>
  <text start="417.78" dur="2.94">fact they&amp;#39;ve been doing this of course</text>
  <text start="419.13" dur="3.69">they haven&amp;#39;t produced anything they</text>
  <text start="420.72" dur="4.38">haven&amp;#39;t really shown any tanks from</text>
  <text start="422.82" dur="4.26">Russia inside Ukraine just like every</text>
  <text start="425.1" dur="3.93">other thing they&amp;#39;ve said we have proof</text>
  <text start="427.08" dur="5.31">yes we have this but if you ever notice</text>
  <text start="429.03" dur="4.74">they never show the proof because you</text>
  <text start="432.39" dur="2.88">know what they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re giving</text>
  <text start="433.77" dur="3.93">you lip service and if they say it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="435.27" dur="5.31">true then it has to be true but we know</text>
  <text start="437.7" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s the actual opposite that it isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="440.58" dur="5.04">true but we have to remember and go back</text>
  <text start="442.44" dur="5.73">to the time where we saw tanks from</text>
  <text start="445.62" dur="5.1">Ukraine all in the southeastern region</text>
  <text start="448.17" dur="6.75">some were being abandoned and this is</text>
  <text start="450.72" dur="5.85">exactly where these groups got the tanks</text>
  <text start="454.92" dur="3.09">they didn&amp;#39;t get them from Russia they</text>
  <text start="456.57" dur="3.09">got it from the Ukraine side because</text>
  <text start="458.01" dur="3.93">they brought him into and there&amp;#39;s actual</text>
  <text start="459.66" dur="5.37">video all over the place showing</text>
  <text start="461.94" dur="5.25">Ukrainian tanks in the southeastern</text>
  <text start="465.03" dur="4.92">region some of them were abandoned and</text>
  <text start="467.19" dur="6.57">left there and the people there took</text>
  <text start="469.95" dur="5.88">them and use them now we understand that</text>
  <text start="473.76" dur="3.93">Ukrainian government the puppet regime</text>
  <text start="475.83" dur="5.22">of United States central bankers have</text>
  <text start="477.69" dur="6.17">been using white phosphorus on the</text>
  <text start="481.05" dur="5.82">people in Donetsk and slavonski and</text>

  <text start="486.87" dur="3.69">the White House and they are completely</text>
  <text start="488.58" dur="3.839">sidestepping it they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="490.56" dur="3.84">answer about anything that was going on</text>
  <text start="492.419" dur="4.021">with white phosphorus right now and you</text>
  <text start="494.4" dur="4.71">can see that is a complete cover-up they</text>
  <text start="496.44" dur="4.74">are now provoking Russia anyway they</text>
  <text start="499.11" dur="4.98">possibly can and how else are they</text>

  <text start="547.29" dur="3.09">exactly what they do now on the other</text>
  <text start="548.55" dur="4.05">breath the United States is out there</text>
  <text start="550.38" dur="3.9">saying the u.s. condemned the attack on</text>

  <text start="579.93" dur="3.96">positions and that&amp;#39;s what they did they</text>
  <text start="581.85" dur="5.01">brought those people in then they had an</text>
  <text start="583.89" dur="5.04">election when there was the southeast</text>
  <text start="586.86" dur="4.14">section was trying to remove itself from</text>

  <text start="629.61" dur="4.59">and they had no problems there that we</text>
  <text start="631.38" dur="4.83">have to remember if the United States</text>

  <text start="641.13" dur="3.12">terrorists if it&amp;#39;s on the other foot and</text>
  <text start="642.81" dur="4.02">they don&amp;#39;t have control the government</text>
  <text start="644.25" dur="6.06">then the people have the right and they</text>
  <text start="646.83" dur="4.95">they say that they need freedom</text>
  <text start="650.31" dur="3.96">democracy and they should have the right</text>
  <text start="651.78" dur="4.74">to count to kick out the government so</text>
  <text start="654.27" dur="4.59">we can see what is going on here they</text>
  <text start="656.52" dur="4.71">are really pushing this agenda here to</text>
  <text start="658.86" dur="4.2">get Russia involved somehow and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="661.23" dur="7.02">not going to stop and so far what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="663.06" dur="8.88">seen is they haven&amp;#39;t stopped one bit now</text>
  <text start="668.25" dur="6.69">out in Iraq the allow channels reporting</text>
  <text start="671.94" dur="4.2">that the Iraq army has been trained for</text>
  <text start="674.94" dur="3.06">years by the United States</text>
  <text start="676.14" dur="4.41">but many of the soldiers through their</text>
  <text start="678" dur="4.11">weapons and fled the reason for that is</text>
  <text start="680.55" dur="3.93">they do not have something to fight for</text>
  <text start="682.11" dur="4.59">and again the United States and central</text>
  <text start="684.48" dur="4.71">bankers they can send billions and</text>
  <text start="686.7" dur="4.83">billions of dollars into Iraq they can</text>
  <text start="689.19" dur="7.38">send weapons they can send aircraft but</text>
  <text start="691.53" dur="7.59">if the people decide not to fight that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="696.57" dur="5.07">where the problem is they always have a</text>
  <text start="699.12" dur="4.14">choice and it seems like a lot of the</text>
  <text start="701.64" dur="3.75">forces in Iraq right now is saying you</text>
  <text start="703.26" dur="4.17">know what I&amp;#39;m not fighting for this I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="705.39" dur="4.11">not going to die for this because I</text>
  <text start="707.43" dur="5.07">really have no reason at this time and</text>
  <text start="709.5" dur="5.4">this is the problem that&amp;#39;s going on in</text>
  <text start="712.5" dur="3.99">Iraq and we can see the forces in Iraq</text>
  <text start="714.9" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re taking over more and more cities</text>
  <text start="716.49" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re moving into Baghdad they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="719.04" dur="4.65">pushed back a little bit but of course</text>
  <text start="720.75" dur="5.7">the US spy drones failed to predict rise</text>
  <text start="723.69" dur="4.86">of Iraq militants a secret US drone</text>
  <text start="726.45" dur="5.73">program proved little used to American</text>
  <text start="728.55" dur="6.6">and Iraqi officials to really see this</text>
  <text start="732.18" dur="5.22">coming well for one thing I think they</text>
  <text start="735.15" dur="4.59">let it happen I think they wanted it to</text>
  <text start="737.4" dur="5.16">happen I think they wanted to create</text>
  <text start="739.74" dur="4.74">this case where they can say yes these</text>
  <text start="742.56" dur="4.23">people these groups are coming down from</text>
  <text start="744.48" dur="4.35">Syria and we are definitely going to get</text>
  <text start="746.79" dur="3.36">in there and bomb Syria and I think this</text>
  <text start="748.83" dur="3.09">is what their plan was from the</text>
  <text start="750.15" dur="4.11">beginning yes these are people there</text>
  <text start="751.92" dur="4.8">fighting back they want their country</text>
  <text start="754.26" dur="5.25">back they want to remove the United</text>
  <text start="756.72" dur="4.77">States the central bankers and this is</text>
  <text start="759.51" dur="4.23">going to be a problem but I think part</text>
  <text start="761.49" dur="4.2">of this is the United States central</text>
  <text start="763.74" dur="3.51">bankers wanted this to happen because</text>
  <text start="765.69" dur="3.9">they knew they were going to need to</text>
  <text start="767.25" dur="4.5">bring in forces somehow someway and</text>
  <text start="769.59" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re going to need to bring them in</text>
  <text start="771.75" dur="4.11">and get into Syria and I think this is</text>
  <text start="773.88" dur="4.74">what they&amp;#39;ve been planning now the</text>
  <text start="775.86" dur="5.52">Pentagon right now as we know is</text>
  <text start="778.62" dur="6.18">bringing in the George HW Bush aircraft</text>
  <text start="781.38" dur="5.76">or aircraft carrier and that is</text>
  <text start="784.8" dur="4.38">accompanied by a guided missile cruiser</text>
  <text start="787.14" dur="4.74">USS Philippine Sea and the</text>

  <text start="798.03" dur="4.26">still out there is an assault ship with</text>
  <text start="799.68" dur="4.59">a thousand Marines on there we also</text>

  <text start="808.839" dur="4.92">mercenaries so we can see they are</text>
  <text start="810.699" dur="5.64">really ramping up to do something in</text>
