  <text start="127.149" dur="4.351">people will take this because eventually</text>
  <text start="129.759" dur="6.061">what will happen is that the Greek</text>
  <text start="131.5" dur="6.87">population their backs will be pushed</text>
  <text start="135.82" dur="5.82">against the wall they will not be able</text>
  <text start="138.37" dur="7.44">to take much more of this and we might</text>
  <text start="141.64" dur="6.24">see a Greek revolution happen in Greece</text>
  <text start="145.81" dur="5.13">and this is something that we need to</text>
  <text start="147.88" dur="4.889">watch in that area now we talk about</text>
  <text start="150.94" dur="4.919">real estate not just here in the United</text>
  <text start="152.769" dur="5.701">States but in the rest of the world and</text>
  <text start="155.859" dur="5.16">we talked about Vancouver how housing</text>
  <text start="158.47" dur="5.4">prices are coming down the MLS we see</text>
  <text start="161.019" dur="4.351">sales or dropping traffic driving up</text>
  <text start="163.87" dur="6.119">the United States we&amp;#39;re seeing the same</text>
  <text start="165.37" dur="8.58">thing out in the UK the biggest estate</text>
  <text start="169.989" dur="6.541">agent says that economic weakness will</text>
  <text start="173.95" dur="6.36">hit the property market they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="176.53" dur="8.16">that the housing prices they will fall</text>
  <text start="180.31" dur="5.789">next year as the economy weakens now of</text>
  <text start="184.69" dur="3.689">course they&amp;#39;re blaming this on the</text>
  <text start="186.099" dur="4.831">brexit but this has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="188.379" dur="5.311">the brexit this was going to happen no</text>
  <text start="190.93" dur="5.04">matter what this was already in the</text>
  <text start="193.69" dur="3.87">works where housing prices are dropping</text>
  <text start="195.97" dur="5.4">this is why we see it dropping in the</text>
  <text start="197.56" dur="5.97">United States out in Canada in the UK</text>
  <text start="201.37" dur="6.089">throughout Europe and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="203.53" dur="6.629">spread so they&amp;#39;re saying that the prices</text>
  <text start="207.459" dur="5.161">are going to fall by 1% in 2017 the</text>
  <text start="210.159" dur="4.8">second half of 2016 we&amp;#39;ll start to see</text>
  <text start="212.62" dur="5.429">prices come down and I&amp;#39;m saying that</text>
  <text start="214.959" dur="6.39">this is going to be much much worse it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="218.049" dur="5.52">almost like the IMF and the Fed making</text>
  <text start="221.349" dur="4.021">their predictions of how countries are</text>
  <text start="223.569" dur="4.381">going to grow well they&amp;#39;re going to grow</text>
  <text start="225.37" dur="5.28">by three point five percent gdp and they</text>
  <text start="227.95" dur="4.98">always bring them down to two 1.5% and</text>
  <text start="230.65" dur="4.86">when they tell you that housing prices</text>
  <text start="232.93" dur="6.57">are going to come down they always start</text>
  <text start="235.51" dur="5.789">with the lowest percentage it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="239.5" dur="3.75">opposite it&amp;#39;s only going to come down by</text>
  <text start="241.299" dur="4.651">point five percent one percent which</text>
  <text start="243.25" dur="4.65">means that it&amp;#39;s going to drop by four</text>
  <text start="245.95" dur="7.23">five six seven eight even more</text>
  <text start="247.9" dur="8.76">percentage points and they&amp;#39;re just out</text>
  <text start="253.18" dur="5.429">there giving a warning because what</text>
  <text start="256.66" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re saying is the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="258.609" dur="7.521">weakening the consumer confidence is</text>
  <text start="262.21" dur="8.179">declining household spending is</text>
  <text start="266.13" dur="8.19">declining and is rising unemployment</text>
  <text start="270.389" dur="7.481">which we&amp;#39;ve been covering and following</text>
  <text start="274.32" dur="6.129">we have to remember they like to blame</text>
  <text start="277.87" dur="6.359">everything that&amp;#39;s happening right now on</text>
  <text start="280.449" dur="9.021">the brexit but remember they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="284.229" dur="7.951">left the EU yet nothing&amp;#39;s really changed</text>
  <text start="289.47" dur="4.24">except they had a referendum which was</text>
  <text start="292.18" dur="4.799">an advisory referendum but they actually</text>
  <text start="293.71" dur="3.96">didn&amp;#39;t leave but remember back when the</text>
  <text start="296.979" dur="3.871">central bed</text>
  <text start="297.67" dur="5.85">in the UK the government was fear</text>
  <text start="300.85" dur="5.49">mongering they were predicting an</text>
  <text start="303.52" dur="5.46">economic meltdown if Britain would leave</text>
  <text start="306.34" dur="3.75">as soon as I came in and they vote to</text>
  <text start="308.98" dur="5.67">leave the whole thing would just</text>
  <text start="310.09" dur="8.64">collapse we would see job losses the</text>
  <text start="314.65" dur="7.17">markets crashing what happened to all</text>
  <text start="318.73" dur="5.13">that fear mongering well again it was</text>
  <text start="321.82" dur="3.93">the opposite remember whenever the US</text>
  <text start="323.86" dur="3.24">government whenever any government or</text>
  <text start="325.75" dur="4.8">central bank tells you what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="327.1" dur="4.86">happen it&amp;#39;s always the opposite actually</text>
  <text start="330.55" dur="3.63">it&amp;#39;s the best thing that they leave the</text>
  <text start="331.96" dur="6.14">EU actually the economy will most likely</text>
  <text start="334.18" dur="8.61">improve but the problem is the entire</text>
  <text start="338.1" dur="7.6">private western central bank system is</text>
  <text start="342.79" dur="6.14">collapsing and it will bring that down</text>
  <text start="345.7" dur="8.49">with it so everything they told us about</text>
  <text start="348.93" dur="10.36">did not come true it was a lie once</text>
  <text start="354.19" dur="7.64">again and remember they said to invert</text>
  <text start="359.29" dur="5.64">to avoid all this doom and gloom</text>
  <text start="361.83" dur="7.74">everyone would have to vote to stay in</text>
  <text start="364.93" dur="6.81">the EU well the people didn&amp;#39;t listen and</text>
  <text start="369.57" dur="3.88">they decided you know what we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="371.74" dur="4.83">to be part of the EU and nothing</text>
  <text start="373.45" dur="6.15">happened once again so who does the</text>
  <text start="376.57" dur="5.55">fear-mongering the central bank the</text>
  <text start="379.6" dur="5.25">government&amp;#39;s the whole thing backfired</text>
  <text start="382.12" dur="6.12">now Sweden is out there warning the UK</text>
  <text start="384.85" dur="6.51">against aggressive tax cuts amid the</text>
  <text start="388.24" dur="5.22">brexit talks they&amp;#39;re worried that the UK</text>
  <text start="391.36" dur="5.91">will do something smart like lower</text>
  <text start="393.46" dur="7.71">corporate taxes again so this is the</text>
  <text start="397.27" dur="5.73">actual opposite if the UK cuts taxes</text>
  <text start="401.17" dur="7.65">most likely more business will come into</text>
  <text start="403" dur="9.66">that area and they know this so we can</text>
  <text start="408.82" dur="7.2">see right now that the banks the</text>
  <text start="412.66" dur="6.03">government&amp;#39;s the central bank&amp;#39;s whatever</text>
  <text start="416.02" dur="4.85">they say it&amp;#39;s always the opposite they</text>
  <text start="418.69" dur="5.37">like to lie to the people quite a bit</text>
  <text start="420.87" dur="5.23">the Baltic Dry Index it is around six</text>
  <text start="424.06" dur="3.81">hundred and eighty seven points and when</text>
  <text start="426.1" dur="3.69">we look at the Baltic Dry Index money go</text>
  <text start="427.87" dur="3.36">back a couple of years we can see the</text>
  <text start="429.79" dur="3.81">Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="431.23" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s in a downward trend if we go back</text>
  <text start="433.6" dur="4.56">just to last year we saw the Baltic Dry</text>
  <text start="435.22" dur="5.13">Index was around 940 so points around</text>
  <text start="438.16" dur="4.29">this time frame and then it dropped off</text>
  <text start="440.35" dur="4.89">significantly the same thing is going to</text>
  <text start="442.45" dur="5.67">happen once again and the Baltic Dry</text>
  <text start="445.24" dur="4.74">Index is going to continually drop as we</text>
  <text start="448.12" dur="4.83">move throughout this year and most</text>
  <text start="449.98" dur="4.83">likely we&amp;#39;re going to hit lower lows now</text>
  <text start="452.95" dur="4.23">when we look at corporate defaults in</text>
  <text start="454.81" dur="4.38">just a month ago we looked at the</text>
  <text start="457.18" dur="4.02">corporate defaults and we notice that</text>
  <text start="459.19" dur="4.34">the tongue the total number of global</text>
  <text start="461.2" dur="5.91">defaults hit around 100 according to S&amp;amp;P</text>
  <text start="463.53" dur="5.08">calculations and that rose about fifty</text>
  <text start="467.11" dur="4.2">percent from the number of bankruptcy at</text>
  <text start="468.61" dur="5.42">this time last year and the highest</text>
  <text start="471.31" dur="6.48">level since the financial crisis and</text>
  <text start="474.03" dur="7.66">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now one month</text>
  <text start="477.79" dur="5.79">later we have learned that another 13</text>
  <text start="481.69" dur="5.01">companies have filed for bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="483.58" dur="5.94">protection bringing the grand total to a</text>
  <text start="486.7" dur="4.86">hundred and thirteen matching the number</text>
  <text start="489.52" dur="6.93">of companies which defaulted globally in</text>
  <text start="491.56" dur="9.09">all of 2015 the last time the global</text>
  <text start="496.45" dur="7.62">tally was higher at this point in the</text>
  <text start="500.65" dur="5.49">year was in 2009 when it reached 208</text>
  <text start="504.07" dur="8.88">during the financial crisis so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="506.14" dur="9.54">midway through 2016 we were at 113 again</text>
  <text start="512.95" dur="6.6">where is this recovery it&amp;#39;s not out</text>
  <text start="515.68" dur="5.34">there an S &amp;amp; S &amp;amp; P their estimating that</text>
  <text start="519.55" dur="3.6">the US corporate default rate is</text>
  <text start="521.02" dur="6.29">expected to jump thirty percent and hit</text>
  <text start="523.15" dur="7.47">five point six percent by June of 2017</text>
  <text start="527.31" dur="5.14">we&amp;#39;re looking at 99 US companies with</text>
  <text start="530.62" dur="4.32">the lowest credit ratings are expected</text>
  <text start="532.45" dur="6.36">to default in the 12-month period ending</text>
  <text start="534.94" dur="7.05">june 2017 and this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="538.81" dur="6.87">complete disaster and every time we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="541.99" dur="7.11">seen this guess what happens we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="545.68" dur="5.76">recession / depression we saw it back in</text>
  <text start="549.1" dur="4.56">nineteen ninety one we saw it back in</text>
  <text start="551.44" dur="5.25">two thousand one we saw it back in two</text>
  <text start="553.66" dur="8.61">thousand eight and here we are once</text>
  <text start="556.69" dur="7.87">again we&amp;#39;re on the same track we see</text>
  <text start="562.27" dur="5.77">Merkel halong</text>
  <text start="564.56" dur="7.32">renzi they&amp;#39;re all meeting together to</text>
  <text start="568.04" dur="8.489">relaunch the European Union they are now</text>
  <text start="571.88" dur="9.84">going into Africa they&amp;#39;re going to give</text>
  <text start="576.529" dur="7.951">them incentives to join the EU because</text>
  <text start="581.72" dur="5.52">for their system to work they need more</text>
  <text start="584.48" dur="5.97">countries in their system so they can</text>
  <text start="587.24" dur="5.789">spread the debt out further without this</text>
  <text start="590.45" dur="6.9">the system comes to a screeching halt</text>
  <text start="593.029" dur="7.171">and we can see that the EU wants to</text>
  <text start="597.35" dur="5.61">bring in more and more countries to</text>
  <text start="600.2" dur="4.71">spread the debt just like the United</text>
  <text start="602.96" dur="3.84">States they need to continually spread</text>
  <text start="604.91" dur="3.81">the debt they need to capture countries</text>
  <text start="606.8" dur="4.65">place the dollar on their natural</text>

  <text start="618.47" dur="6.119">the Middle East things are getting worse</text>
  <text start="621.73" dur="5.609">as time goes on it looks like the</text>
  <text start="624.589" dur="8.841">petrodollar most likely is doomed and</text>

  <text start="647.3" dur="6.51">an economic shock we know something is</text>
  <text start="651.29" dur="4.32">about to happen especially when the Fed</text>
  <text start="653.81" dur="3.6">comes out and tells us that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="655.61" dur="3.78">forecasting recession but they don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="661.04" dur="4.38">be heading right to uh towards another</text>
  <text start="662.75" dur="6.6">financial crisis what they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="665.42" dur="6.84">about is what they would do if there was</text>
  <text start="669.35" dur="6.72">an economic shock which means they have</text>
  <text start="672.26" dur="6.15">plans for when this collapse comes they</text>

  <text start="684.95" dur="4.97">it&amp;#39;s going to be much worse than a</text>
  <text start="686.839" dur="6.931">recession but let&amp;#39;s go with recession</text>
  <text start="689.92" dur="7.48">there already factoring in a scenario in</text>

  <text start="697.4" dur="7.02">dish</text>
  <text start="698.06" dur="9.24">qe of around 4 trillion this would</text>

  <text start="732.77" dur="7.53">this going to work most likely not and</text>
  <text start="737.17" dur="5.02">we&amp;#39;re going to see people start to</text>
  <text start="740.3" dur="4.02">realize that okay what just happened</text>
  <text start="742.19" dur="5.27">here they&amp;#39;re going to create another</text>
  <text start="744.32" dur="6.15">four trillion to save this economy</text>

  <text start="762.32" dur="5.37">looking at everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="764.8" dur="5.29">researching all the indicators that</text>
  <text start="767.69" dur="6.11">we&amp;#39;ve been following it&amp;#39;s showing us</text>

  <text start="773.8" dur="7.06">there&amp;#39;s no reason for the Fed to look at</text>
  <text start="778.04" dur="5.28">this and analyze and come up with a plan</text>
  <text start="780.86" dur="5.69">for another economic shock because</text>
  <text start="783.32" dur="6.69">aren&amp;#39;t they in control of the economy</text>
  <text start="786.55" dur="7.03">don&amp;#39;t they know how the economy is doing</text>

  <text start="809.6" dur="5.12">no just to make it hold on long enough</text>
  <text start="814.81" dur="7.36">to start the next event this is all</text>
  <text start="819.59" dur="6.24">they&amp;#39;re going to do then they&amp;#39;ll point</text>
  <text start="822.17" dur="6.99">their fingers because when the system</text>
  <text start="825.83" dur="5.73">comes crumbling down you can expect</text>
  <text start="829.16" dur="3.96">certain events to occur</text>
  <text start="831.56" dur="4.86">was likely a cyberattack on the</text>

  <text start="848.839" dur="6.571">now we need to start QE up once again</text>
  <text start="852.2" dur="5.579">and first we&amp;#39;ll start off by maybe</text>
  <text start="855.41" dur="5.55">creating one trillion that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ll</text>

  <text start="860.96" dur="3.66">trillion before you know it they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="863.12" dur="3.6">up to four trillion so this number four</text>
  <text start="864.62" dur="3.96">trillion most likely will be about 16</text>
  <text start="866.72" dur="5.34">trillion by that by the time this is all</text>
  <text start="868.58" dur="5.22">done because this next shock is not</text>
