  <text start="81.04" dur="5.12">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="83.17" dur="6.03">news now we know the plan is to</text>
  <text start="86.16" dur="5.41">contradict the Fed and blame the Fed</text>
  <text start="89.2" dur="3.51">when the economy comes down and what</text>
  <text start="91.57" dur="3.99">we&amp;#39;ve been watching and what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="92.71" dur="4.98">seeing is exactly that Trump is out</text>
  <text start="95.56" dur="3.899">there contradicting the Fed pointing the</text>
  <text start="97.69" dur="4.26">finger saying the Fed is going to be</text>
  <text start="99.459" dur="4.951">responsible if the economy falls apart</text>
  <text start="101.95" dur="5.16">other presidents have done this in the</text>
  <text start="104.41" dur="5.58">past and some of them have been</text>
  <text start="107.11" dur="5.94">assassinated others have been shot at</text>
  <text start="109.99" dur="5.46">and they never mentioned it again so</text>
  <text start="113.05" dur="5.849">this is a definite risk but we can see</text>
  <text start="115.45" dur="6.33">right now that the plan is to box the</text>
  <text start="118.899" dur="4.95">Fed in and it looks like the Fed is</text>
  <text start="121.78" dur="4.44">boxed in and remember I do believe that</text>
  <text start="123.849" dur="4.86">Powell is working with Trump they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="126.22" dur="6.45">both on the same side he chose Powell to</text>
  <text start="128.709" dur="6.421">be in power and he is now the Fed chair</text>
  <text start="132.67" dur="4.02">and Trump looks like he&amp;#39;s using the same</text>
  <text start="135.13" dur="3.51">exact strategy that he used what</text>
  <text start="136.69" dur="3.03">sessions oh I don&amp;#39;t really want him in</text>
  <text start="138.64" dur="3.42">there I thought he was going to be an</text>
  <text start="139.72" dur="4.44">easy money Fed he knew exactly who this</text>
  <text start="142.06" dur="4.97">individual was he knew that he was going</text>
  <text start="144.16" dur="7.11">to push the interest rates higher every</text>
  <text start="147.03" dur="5.65">single time and it looks like the plan</text>
  <text start="151.27" dur="3.299">is working and we&amp;#39;ll be talking about</text>
  <text start="152.68" dur="4.29">that a little bit later in this report</text>
  <text start="154.569" dur="3.871">but I wanted to go out to the UK right</text>
  <text start="156.97" dur="3.93">now because we know the brexit deal is</text>
  <text start="158.44" dur="5.31">going on and it looks like Theresa May</text>
  <text start="160.9" dur="4.05">it looks like she might finally be close</text>
  <text start="163.75" dur="3.48">to securing a</text>
  <text start="164.95" dur="5.64">deal that stands a chance of winning</text>
  <text start="167.23" dur="5.66">parliamentary approval thanks to a major</text>
  <text start="170.59" dur="5.1">concession from the European Union now</text>
  <text start="172.89" dur="6.97">the only problem with this deal is that</text>
  <text start="175.69" dur="6.21">it&amp;#39;s secret and a lot of the individuals</text>
  <text start="179.86" dur="4.44">that voted for the brexit they really</text>
  <text start="181.9" dur="3.9">don&amp;#39;t know what this deals about now Mae</text>
  <text start="184.3" dur="4.74">has reportedly developed a detailed</text>
  <text start="185.8" dur="4.89">fifty page plan for a brexit treaty that</text>
  <text start="189.04" dur="4.05">will allow the entire UK to remain</text>
  <text start="190.69" dur="4.29">within the EU customs union that is</text>
  <text start="193.09" dur="5.04">until a final deal can be hammered out</text>
  <text start="194.98" dur="6.81">during the transition area period now</text>
  <text start="198.13" dur="7.199">that is the key word transitionary</text>
  <text start="201.79" dur="5.88">period because the brexit errs you know</text>
  <text start="205.329" dur="4.791">what they are fearing the most that this</text>
  <text start="207.67" dur="6.12">transitioning this transitionary period</text>
  <text start="210.12" dur="6.61">will last forever and the country will</text>
  <text start="213.79" dur="4.289">be in limbo forever and I think this is</text>
  <text start="216.73" dur="2.819">what they&amp;#39;re actually trying to do I</text>
  <text start="218.079" dur="4.5">think this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="219.549" dur="5.611">push here because they figure you know</text>
  <text start="222.579" dur="5.75">what let&amp;#39;s say we&amp;#39;re going forward with</text>
  <text start="225.16" dur="5.94">this deal we&amp;#39;ll keep it in limbo and</text>
  <text start="228.329" dur="6.101">we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll say we&amp;#39;re working out the</text>
  <text start="231.1" dur="4.139">logistics to the entire deal and what do</text>
  <text start="234.43" dur="2.97">you get out of it</text>
  <text start="235.239" dur="4.5">well the UK is really still part of the</text>
  <text start="237.4" dur="4.47">EU the brexit errs didn&amp;#39;t get what they</text>
  <text start="239.739" dur="3.951">wanted they can&amp;#39;t really argue because</text>
  <text start="241.87" dur="4.679">it&amp;#39;s right in the middle of the</text>
  <text start="243.69" dur="4.21">transition period and they&amp;#39;re worried</text>
  <text start="246.549" dur="4.53">that there&amp;#39;s never going to be an</text>
  <text start="247.9" dur="6.57">outcome from this transitionary period</text>
  <text start="251.079" dur="5.101">and it looks like this is one way they</text>
  <text start="254.47" dur="2.819">might be trying to get around this the</text>
  <text start="256.18" dur="4.08">other thing is we have to ask ourselves</text>
  <text start="257.289" dur="4.401">why is it secret I mean the people came</text>
  <text start="260.26" dur="3.33">out and they voted and they said listen</text>
  <text start="261.69" dur="4.539">we don&amp;#39;t want to be part of the EU</text>
  <text start="263.59" dur="5.97">anymore why does the deal have to be</text>
  <text start="266.229" dur="6.901">secret the people should know what this</text>
  <text start="269.56" dur="4.829">deal is about and you know what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="273.13" dur="3.78">to happen with a transitionary period</text>
  <text start="274.389" dur="4.021">there&amp;#39;s never gonna be a deal and you</text>
  <text start="276.91" dur="3.689">can see that the central banks are still</text>
  <text start="278.41" dur="4.439">pushing their agenda we see out in the</text>
  <text start="280.599" dur="4.5">United States that the entire housing</text>
  <text start="282.849" dur="3.781">market well it&amp;#39;s starting to implode</text>
  <text start="285.099" dur="3.721">right now out in California</text>
  <text start="286.63" dur="5.4">homes in California they&amp;#39;re plunging</text>
  <text start="288.82" dur="5.4">very quickly like it&amp;#39;s 2008 now</text>
  <text start="292.03" dur="3.99">CoreLogic we mentioned San Francisco and</text>
  <text start="294.22" dur="3.18">other areas in California before but</text>
  <text start="296.02" dur="2.619">core logic is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="297.4" dur="4.57">saying that they</text>
  <text start="298.639" dur="6.151">the housing market is plummeting I mean</text>
  <text start="301.97" dur="5.25">it is fallen by 18 percent now we know</text>
  <text start="304.79" dur="5.01">why this is happening we understand why</text>
  <text start="307.22" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s happening because the Fed is</text>
  <text start="309.8" dur="2.91">raising the interest rates what happens</text>
  <text start="311.21" dur="3.179">when you raise the interest rates we</text>
  <text start="312.71" dur="3.48">spoke about this many many times before</text>
  <text start="314.389" dur="3.81">and we knew that this was going to</text>
  <text start="316.19" dur="3.47">happen once the rates started to move up</text>
  <text start="318.199" dur="4.071">it pushed people out of the market</text>
  <text start="319.66" dur="5.05">because they now can&amp;#39;t afford the house</text>
  <text start="322.27" dur="3.82">the prices are too high yes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="324.71" dur="3.12">coming down in many different areas</text>
  <text start="326.09" dur="4.41">people are gonna start taking their</text>
  <text start="327.83" dur="4.98">houses off the market and people are</text>
  <text start="330.5" dur="5.01">gonna wait it out this is what happened</text>
  <text start="332.81" dur="4.68">prior to 2008 2009 with the housing</text>
  <text start="335.51" dur="4.56">market there&amp;#39;s no difference really well</text>
  <text start="337.49" dur="6.48">there is one difference back then it was</text>
  <text start="340.07" dur="6.21">a people driven bubble today it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="343.97" dur="4.02">central bank bubble of the housing</text>
  <text start="346.28" dur="3.96">market and they only blew up the bubble</text>
  <text start="347.99" dur="4.17">in 20 cities and when this comes</text>
  <text start="350.24" dur="4.47">tumbling down and actually they blew the</text>
  <text start="352.16" dur="4.979">bubbles in many many places twice as</text>
  <text start="354.71" dur="6.51">large and when this system comes down</text>
  <text start="357.139" dur="8.551">it&amp;#39;s going to be a disaster now remember</text>
  <text start="361.22" dur="8.73">the plan here is to box the feted and</text>
  <text start="365.69" dur="5.729">make the Fed take the blame and we can</text>
  <text start="369.95" dur="2.88">see with what is happening in the</text>
  <text start="371.419" dur="3.18">economy right now I know Trump is out</text>
  <text start="372.83" dur="3.98">there pushing the idea that the economy</text>
  <text start="374.599" dur="4.531">is doing great everything&amp;#39;s fantastic</text>
  <text start="376.81" dur="4.87">the mainstream media is having a very</text>
  <text start="379.13" dur="5.099">difficult time combating what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="381.68" dur="3.75">saying I mean Obama is out there trying</text>
  <text start="384.229" dur="3.151">to convince everyone that it&amp;#39;s his</text>
  <text start="385.43" dur="4.65">economy the reason why he&amp;#39;s doing this</text>
  <text start="387.38" dur="6.06">is to basically take the blame off of</text>
  <text start="390.08" dur="5.339">him and make the blame go to the Fed</text>
  <text start="393.44" dur="3.96">this is why he&amp;#39;s contradicting the Fed</text>
  <text start="395.419" dur="3.361">this is why he&amp;#39;s out there but one thing</text>
  <text start="397.4" dur="3.36">that we can see right now is the</text>
  <text start="398.78" dur="4.08">manipulation it&amp;#39;s not making sense</text>
  <text start="400.76" dur="4.77">anymore because if you look at markets</text>
  <text start="402.86" dur="5.369">manufacturing and the is M manufacturing</text>
  <text start="405.53" dur="5.669">surveys they&amp;#39;re all over the place it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="408.229" dur="6.331">complete confusion right now because</text>
  <text start="411.199" dur="5.521">it&amp;#39;s all manipulated and as we move</text>
  <text start="414.56" dur="3.75">forward a lot of the numbers aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="416.72" dur="3.629">going to make sense and when things</text>
  <text start="418.31" dur="4.68">start to break down the numbers aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="420.349" dur="5.461">really going to make sense at all just</text>
  <text start="422.99" dur="5.1">like we saw back in 2008 really go back</text>
  <text start="425.81" dur="3.9">to that time period and really think</text>
  <text start="428.09" dur="3">about what happened here</text>
  <text start="429.71" dur="4.35">even if you were one of those people</text>
  <text start="431.09" dur="4.65">that you know hey back in 2008 I still</text>
  <text start="434.06" dur="3.39">had my job there were no problems</text>
  <text start="435.74" dur="3.27">everything looked great yes people</text>
  <text start="437.45" dur="4.08">around me were getting laid off I saw</text>
  <text start="439.01" dur="5.01">the companies closing but I was safe I</text>
  <text start="441.53" dur="5.28">didn&amp;#39;t get raises for a couple of years</text>
  <text start="444.02" dur="4.47">but I was safe but even if you&amp;#39;re one of</text>
  <text start="446.81" dur="3.75">those people or you&amp;#39;re one of those</text>
  <text start="448.49" dur="4.65">people that got hit really hard think</text>
  <text start="450.56" dur="5.4">about what happened back then when you</text>
  <text start="453.14" dur="4.62">saw the entire system start to fall</text>
  <text start="455.96" dur="3.69">apart you heard layoffs were coming</text>
  <text start="457.76" dur="4.26">you heard corporations they needed</text>
  <text start="459.65" dur="3.93">bailouts at that time the stock market</text>
  <text start="462.02" dur="4.44">was around 14,000 points and it was</text>
  <text start="463.58" dur="5.88">going higher lower higher lower but it</text>
  <text start="466.46" dur="5.25">was pretty darn high when you look back</text>
  <text start="469.46" dur="4.44">in time the housing market there were</text>
  <text start="471.71" dur="3.93">telling you that it was contained</text>
  <text start="473.9" dur="3.51">everything was fine the subprime</text>
  <text start="475.64" dur="3.21">securities at that time they were</text>
  <text start="477.41" dur="4.74">telling you they were triple-a</text>
  <text start="478.85" dur="4.77">so on paper but all the statistics that</text>
  <text start="482.15" dur="3.15">you looked at it looked like everything</text>
  <text start="483.62" dur="3.36">was great and then you had these</text>
  <text start="485.3" dur="3.69">anomalies with these companies like know</text>
  <text start="486.98" dur="3.42">what&amp;#39;s going on with Bear Stearns what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="488.99" dur="2.85">going on with AIG it&amp;#39;s a one-off thing</text>
  <text start="490.4" dur="3.3">they just need a little bit of money to</text>
  <text start="491.84" dur="3.26">get by and everything will be fine and</text>
  <text start="493.7" dur="4.62">then what happened</text>
  <text start="495.1" dur="4.96">everything started to fall apart company</text>
  <text start="498.32" dur="4.56">after company after company needed a</text>
  <text start="500.06" dur="6.63">bailout the entire autumn of automotive</text>
  <text start="502.88" dur="7.56">industry needed a bailout I mean going</text>
  <text start="506.69" dur="6.54">back in June of that year of 2008 no one</text>
  <text start="510.44" dur="4.26">would have even seen this coming because</text>
  <text start="513.23" dur="2.88">everyone was looking at the mainstream</text>
  <text start="514.7" dur="5.04">media ever was listening to the Fed and</text>
  <text start="516.11" dur="4.86">no one even realized it today the same</text>
  <text start="519.74" dur="3.54">things happening but it&amp;#39;s much much</text>
  <text start="520.97" dur="4.88">worse because they didn&amp;#39;t make anything</text>
  <text start="523.28" dur="7.59">better the whole thing is an illusion</text>
  <text start="525.85" dur="8.71">Trump&amp;#39;s using this illusion to point the</text>
  <text start="530.87" dur="5.64">finger at the organization that is going</text>
  <text start="534.56" dur="5.12">to be blamed and that is the central</text>
  <text start="536.51" dur="6.03">bank now we know the market has been</text>
  <text start="539.68" dur="5.68">moving up moving down eight trillion</text>
  <text start="542.54" dur="6.48">dollars poof gone that was the largest</text>
  <text start="545.36" dur="5.46">drop since 2008 and Trump came out and</text>
  <text start="549.02" dur="5.13">he tweeted the following and this is</text>
  <text start="550.82" dur="5.97">very important if the Fed backs off and</text>
  <text start="554.15" dur="4.53">starts talking a little more dovish I</text>
  <text start="556.79" dur="5.61">think we&amp;#39;re going to be right back to</text>
  <text start="558.68" dur="4.59">our 2800 to 2900 target range that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="562.4" dur="5.64">had for the</text>
  <text start="563.27" dur="6.99">and p500 Scott Ren Wells Fargo Donald</text>
  <text start="568.04" dur="5.49">Trump so what is Trump actually saying</text>
  <text start="570.26" dur="5.75">here he&amp;#39;s basically setting up the</text>
  <text start="573.53" dur="6.48">argument that it&amp;#39;s the feds fault if</text>
  <text start="576.01" dur="7.3">markets can&amp;#39;t advance okay so the Fed is</text>
  <text start="580.01" dur="4.62">raising rates Trump is contradicting</text>
  <text start="583.31" dur="4.59">that saying that they shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="584.63" dur="5.67">raising rates Trump is blaming the Fed</text>
  <text start="587.9" dur="4.89">for the market falling and if they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="590.3" dur="3.96">advance it&amp;#39;s the feds fault and when we</text>
  <text start="592.79" dur="3.69">look at what is going on here especially</text>
  <text start="594.26" dur="4.92">with the interest rates we can see that</text>
  <text start="596.48" dur="5.49">the Fed is continually raising rates</text>
  <text start="599.18" dur="4.41">they are at around two point five</text>
  <text start="601.97" dur="3.6">percent and we know the magic number is</text>
  <text start="603.59" dur="3.57">three percent and when we reach three</text>
  <text start="605.57" dur="3.93">percent that&amp;#39;s when things start to fall</text>
  <text start="607.16" dur="4.92">apart I mean if we go back in time and</text>
  <text start="609.5" dur="5.22">we look at the magic numbers back then</text>
  <text start="612.08" dur="6.18">when we had the recession we look at you</text>
  <text start="614.72" dur="6.51">know 2006 2007 we saw that the interest</text>
  <text start="618.26" dur="4.17">rates hit around 5% and then things</text>
  <text start="621.23" dur="3.57">started to fall apart so the magic</text>
  <text start="622.43" dur="4.29">number back then was 5% if we look back</text>
  <text start="624.8" dur="4.62">prior to 2001 when we had the recession</text>
  <text start="626.72" dur="4.83">then we look at that magic number I mean</text>
  <text start="629.42" dur="4.8">we were looking at something around six</text>
  <text start="631.55" dur="4.47">point seven five percent close to seven</text>
  <text start="634.22" dur="4.26">percent that was the magic number then</text>
  <text start="636.02" dur="4.92">if we go back to the 90s we can see that</text>
  <text start="638.48" dur="5.31">magic number back then was about six</text>
  <text start="640.94" dur="3.99">percent or so so at this point and</text>
  <text start="643.79" dur="2.85">actually if you go all the way back</text>
  <text start="644.93" dur="3.39">you&amp;#39;ll notice that the interest rates</text>
  <text start="646.64" dur="4.98">continually drop drop drop and drop</text>
  <text start="648.32" dur="7.76">since the 80s and the reason for this is</text>
  <text start="651.62" dur="6.42">because the entire system cannot operate</text>
  <text start="656.08" dur="3.1">anymore with high interest rates</text>
  <text start="658.04" dur="4.56">especially with the amount of debt that</text>
  <text start="659.18" dur="6.51">is being poured onto the global planet</text>
  <text start="662.6" dur="6.48">it&amp;#39;s ompletely impossible so we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="665.69" dur="6.18">the lowest point that we&amp;#39;ve seen ever</text>
  <text start="669.08" dur="6.24">and out in Europe there a negative</text>
  <text start="671.87" dur="5.91">territory so what is happening while</text>
  <text start="675.32" dur="5.19">this is all going on here well growth is</text>
  <text start="677.78" dur="7.74">slowing globally and this is with</text>
  <text start="680.51" dur="7.02">negative rates South Korea growth is</text>
  <text start="685.52" dur="4.35">slowing Japan growth is slowing China</text>
  <text start="687.53" dur="5.49">growth too slow and Europe growth is</text>
  <text start="689.87" dur="5.55">slowing every single place growth is</text>
  <text start="693.02" dur="4.11">slowing in the United States debt</text>
  <text start="695.42" dur="5.1">serviceability</text>
  <text start="697.13" dur="5.43">well that&amp;#39;s very difficult because as</text>
  <text start="700.52" dur="4.08">the debt continually moves up which we</text>
  <text start="702.56" dur="4.98">see happening right now I mean in what</text>
  <text start="704.6" dur="5.67">up something like 8 trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="707.54" dur="4.26">since Obama came into office and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="710.27" dur="4.02">going up even further that&amp;#39;s part of the</text>
  <text start="711.8" dur="5.49">plan didn&amp;#39;t keep the debt rising as fast</text>
  <text start="714.29" dur="4.16">as possible when Obama was president it</text>
  <text start="717.29" dur="3.12">was for a different reason</text>
  <text start="718.45" dur="3.91">because they were getting prepared to</text>
  <text start="720.41" dur="3.51">move the system to another country</text>
  <text start="722.36" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re going to have war to cover it up</text>
  <text start="723.92" dur="4.8">now they&amp;#39;re setting up the narrative to</text>
  <text start="726.59" dur="5.16">blame it on the Fed and they want to</text>
  <text start="728.72" dur="4.89">push the economy to the very edge while</text>
  <text start="731.75" dur="4.5">keeping the illusion that the economy is</text>
  <text start="733.61" dur="5.13">doing well so the economy is doing well</text>
  <text start="736.25" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re pushing the debt as far as they</text>
  <text start="738.74" dur="4.2">can go and we know that Bolton came out</text>
  <text start="740.15" dur="5.19">and he said that debt the United States</text>
  <text start="742.94" dur="5.34">that is an economic threat setting up</text>
  <text start="745.34" dur="5.85">the narrative and what they&amp;#39;ve done here</text>
  <text start="748.28" dur="5.66">is they boxed in the Fed how how did</text>
  <text start="751.19" dur="6.24">they box in the Fed well first of all</text>
  <text start="753.94" dur="6.64">corporations they&amp;#39;re on the same debt</text>
  <text start="757.43" dur="7.65">expansion model and they have huge</text>
  <text start="760.58" dur="8.94">problems but the Fed they are in trouble</text>
  <text start="765.08" dur="6.39">and no matter what they do there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="769.52" dur="5.1">nothing they can do to help the</text>
  <text start="771.47" dur="6.18">situation so think about it and this was</text>
  <text start="774.62" dur="4.29">part of the plan and when I say the Fed</text>
  <text start="777.65" dur="3.33">I&amp;#39;m talking about all the bad guys in</text>
  <text start="778.91" dur="4.08">the Fed not those people who are trying</text>
  <text start="780.98" dur="3.6">to get rid of the Fed but the others who</text>
  <text start="782.99" dur="4.02">want the Fed to continue that&amp;#39;s the deep</text>
  <text start="784.58" dur="6.06">state and the rest of the group so if</text>
  <text start="787.01" dur="7.08">Powell doesn&amp;#39;t raise rates in December</text>
  <text start="790.64" dur="5.67">the feds independence will be questioned</text>
  <text start="794.09" dur="3.87">having been perceived to have succumbed</text>
  <text start="796.31" dur="4.32">to political pressure and perhaps</text>
  <text start="797.96" dur="5.43">admitting that the market contra can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="800.63" dur="5.79">handle higher interest rates if Powell</text>
  <text start="803.39" dur="6.27">does raise rates and markets freaking</text>
  <text start="806.42" dur="5.97">break their 2009 trends the ensuing</text>
  <text start="809.66" dur="6.03">market calamity may force the Fed to cut</text>
  <text start="812.39" dur="8.52">rates again in 2019 and they&amp;#39;re blamed</text>
  <text start="815.69" dur="7.02">either way they are stuck and this is</text>
  <text start="820.91" dur="4.26">why the IMF Christine Lagarde was out</text>
  <text start="822.71" dur="4.23">there in the beginning saying the Fed is</text>
  <text start="825.17" dur="3.63">raising rates too quickly slow it down</text>
  <text start="826.94" dur="3.45">maybe we shouldn&amp;#39;t raise it anymore</text>
  <text start="828.8" dur="3.48">some other the</text>
  <text start="830.39" dur="3.38">the other Fed heads said you know maybe</text>
  <text start="832.28" dur="5.13">we shouldn&amp;#39;t be raising rates right now</text>
  <text start="833.77" dur="7.63">but this is part of the plan Trump wants</text>
  <text start="837.41" dur="6.12">Powell to raise rates continue with</text>
  <text start="841.4" dur="4.5">raising rates because he knows and those</text>
  <text start="843.53" dur="5.64">behind him know this will destroy the</text>
  <text start="845.9" dur="4.86">entire system once the system is</text>
  <text start="849.17" dur="3.78">destroyed and I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="850.76" dur="4.62">central bank system it will be blamed on</text>
  <text start="852.95" dur="5.28">them and right now the Fed no matter</text>
  <text start="855.38" dur="7.29">what they do he set it up so they are</text>
  <text start="858.23" dur="6.72">blamed either way he has controlled the</text>
  <text start="862.67" dur="3.78">narrative and other countries are</text>
  <text start="864.95" dur="3.63">starting to realize what is happening</text>
  <text start="866.45" dur="3.78">here and what are they doing well</text>
  <text start="868.58" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re getting out of the central bank</text>
  <text start="870.23" dur="6.26">dollar the Fed dollar this is not a US</text>
  <text start="872.6" dur="9.62">dollar this is a Federal Reserve Note</text>
  <text start="876.49" dur="8.89">backed by nothing and the central bank</text>
  <text start="882.22" dur="6.01">continually pushes the idea that it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="885.38" dur="5.25">stable form of currency of course they</text>
  <text start="888.23" dur="5.34">have to do this it&amp;#39;s their currency but</text>
  <text start="890.63" dur="5.58">it&amp;#39;s been devalued over time like 98</text>
  <text start="893.57" dur="4.59">percent and once all these dollars come</text>
  <text start="896.21" dur="5.79">rushing back to the United States you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="898.16" dur="6.72">gonna see a volatile currency like we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="902" dur="6.06">never seen before but Russia China India</text>
  <text start="904.88" dur="5.24">Japan Turkey Venezuela Iran they have</text>
  <text start="908.06" dur="4.44">all made moves away from the dollar</text>
  <text start="910.12" dur="5.29">including dumping their holdings of US</text>
  <text start="912.5" dur="4.14">debt they know exactly what is going on</text>
  <text start="915.41" dur="3.69">and most of these countries have been</text>
  <text start="916.64" dur="5.13">increasing their gold reserves they</text>
  <text start="919.1" dur="4.83">understand what is going to happen here</text>
  <text start="921.77" dur="4.53">they understand the path that we&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="923.93" dur="5.85">and they&amp;#39;re taking precautions and</text>
  <text start="926.3" dur="6.12">moving away from the old system this is</text>
  <text start="929.78" dur="4.95">the old system we&amp;#39;re headed towards a</text>
  <text start="932.42" dur="5.43">new system we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="934.73" dur="4.98">transitioning to a new system a system</text>
  <text start="937.85" dur="3.63">that is backed by the people and</text>
  <text start="939.71" dur="3.18">remember when we get rid of the Federal</text>
  <text start="941.48" dur="2.58">Reserve it&amp;#39;s not oh we just got rid of</text>
  <text start="942.89" dur="4.22">the central bank in the United States</text>
  <text start="944.06" dur="6.57">we&amp;#39;re talking about getting rid of the</text>
  <text start="947.11" dur="7.29">central banking system the Rothschild</text>
  <text start="950.63" dur="8.1">central bank system this is the entire</text>
  <text start="954.4" dur="8.78">plan that they&amp;#39;re shooting for to get</text>
  <text start="958.73" dur="7.45">rid of those individuals that are behind</text>
  <text start="963.18" dur="6.39">most everything and once you get rid of</text>
  <text start="966.18" dur="6.06">that and you cut off the control of the</text>
  <text start="969.57" dur="4.53">central banks that&amp;#39;s when you&amp;#39;ve removed</text>
  <text start="972.24" dur="3.36">the deep state that&amp;#39;s when you remove</text>
  <text start="974.1" dur="6.6">the corruption that&amp;#39;s when you removed</text>
  <text start="975.6" dur="9.57">all of it and that is the ultimate goal</text>
  <text start="980.7" dur="6.89">and that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re headed and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="985.17" dur="5.04">why it takes so long because remember</text>
  <text start="987.59" dur="6.13">these systems have been been in place</text>
  <text start="990.21" dur="5.99">for a very long time and most of the</text>
  <text start="993.72" dur="5.4">mainstream media most of the countries</text>
  <text start="996.2" dur="4.99">those leaders that are in power now they</text>
  <text start="999.12" dur="4.17">go along with the central bank the</text>
