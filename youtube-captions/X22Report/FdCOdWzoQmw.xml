  <text start="38.8" dur="4.95">saturday let&amp;#39;s get right into the</text>
  <text start="40.78" dur="5.91">economic collapse news now Obamacare is</text>
  <text start="43.75" dur="6.03">completely falling apart we realize that</text>
  <text start="46.69" dur="4.95">premiums are going up of course Obama</text>
  <text start="49.78" dur="4.47">doesn&amp;#39;t want anyone to see the premiums</text>
  <text start="51.64" dur="4.829">until after the elections they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="54.25" dur="4.02">things like there&amp;#39;s a glitch and we</text>
  <text start="56.469" dur="3.061">don&amp;#39;t know why it&amp;#39;s not showing premiums</text>
  <text start="58.27" dur="3.27">but the real reason is because the</text>
  <text start="59.53" dur="4.5">premiums are going to be going up a lot</text>
  <text start="61.54" dur="6.48">more but what we&amp;#39;re seeing now and as we</text>
  <text start="64.03" dur="6.449">know 30,000 walmart employees are going</text>
  <text start="68.02" dur="6.09">to be losing their health insurance but</text>
  <text start="70.479" dur="5.941">they&amp;#39;re not alone 13 states and the</text>
  <text start="74.11" dur="4.52">District of Columbia are canceling plans</text>

  <text start="80.89" dur="5.67">hit with about 250,000 families losing</text>
  <text start="84.04" dur="4.53">their health insurance of course all of</text>
  <text start="86.56" dur="4.2">these plans being canceled now weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="88.57" dur="4.83">in compliance a year ago but back then</text>
  <text start="90.76" dur="4.13">what did President Obama do well he</text>
  <text start="93.4" dur="5.039">asked that they be granted a reprieve</text>
  <text start="94.89" dur="6.39">from the enforcement that is now coming</text>
  <text start="98.439" dur="5.341">to an end as a result hundreds of</text>
  <text start="101.28" dur="4.33">thousands more people will lose their</text>
  <text start="103.78" dur="4.32">health insurance and according to the</text>
  <text start="105.61" dur="4.98">top executive of H&amp;amp;R Block the nation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="108.1" dur="5.1">largest tax preparer Obamacare will add</text>
  <text start="110.59" dur="5.13">significant complexity to next year&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="113.2" dur="4.529">tax season CEO William Cobb warned</text>
  <text start="115.72" dur="4.35">depending on their situation there are</text>
  <text start="117.729" dur="4.89">instances where filers may need to file</text>
  <text start="120.07" dur="5.009">multiple new tax forms and complete</text>
  <text start="122.619" dur="4.29">additional worksheets beginning January</text>
  <text start="125.079" dur="3.36">anyone who does not have health</text>
  <text start="126.909" dur="3.33">insurance that meets the Obamacare</text>
  <text start="128.439" dur="3.63">requirements will be subject to</text>
  <text start="130.239" dur="4.2">penalties as we know there&amp;#39;s penalties</text>
  <text start="132.069" dur="4.2">taxes and everything else intertwined</text>
  <text start="134.439" dur="4.23">into the health insurance and of course</text>
  <text start="136.269" dur="3.931">this is not a benefit for the people if</text>
  <text start="138.669" dur="5.79">you look what&amp;#39;s happening here</text>
  <text start="140.2" dur="7.23">how could this possibly be a benefit for</text>
  <text start="144.459" dur="4.621">the people when you add penalties taxes</text>
  <text start="147.43" dur="3.33">you&amp;#39;re losing your health insurance</text>
  <text start="149.08" dur="3.239">you&amp;#39;re losing your doctor there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="150.76" dur="5.91">nothing that&amp;#39;s benefiting the people</text>
  <text start="152.319" dur="6.39">whatsoever people who receive a subsidy</text>
  <text start="156.67" dur="4.26">for health insurance could be in for a</text>
  <text start="158.709" dur="4.471">shock if calculation show they received</text>
  <text start="160.93" dur="4.86">a larger subsidy than they were entitled</text>
  <text start="163.18" dur="5.07">to well guess what they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="165.79" dur="4.83">to repay the federal government for any</text>
  <text start="168.25" dur="4.98">overage they got and this is going to</text>
  <text start="170.62" dur="6">cause a complete nightmare for many many</text>
  <text start="173.23" dur="5.88">people and we can see Obamacare is not a</text>
  <text start="176.62" dur="4.44">benefit for the people whatsoever it is</text>
  <text start="179.11" dur="3.9">a disaster for the people and this is</text>
  <text start="181.06" dur="3.92">why the government officials decided to</text>
  <text start="183.01" dur="4.44">completely exempt themselves from</text>
  <text start="184.98" dur="4.42">receiving Obamacare they decided to stay</text>
  <text start="187.45" dur="4.59">with their own health insurance and they</text>
  <text start="189.4" dur="5.58">didn&amp;#39;t go ahead and take it and of</text>
  <text start="192.04" dur="7.05">course as our leaders they did not lead</text>
  <text start="194.98" dur="6.27">by action they led by listen this is</text>
  <text start="199.09" dur="3.989">good enough for the people we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="201.25" dur="4.29">it because we know it&amp;#39;s injured time</text>
  <text start="203.079" dur="4.5">with penalties taxes and it&amp;#39;s really not</text>
  <text start="205.54" dur="3.9">beneficial for us because there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="207.579" dur="4.801">benefits involved in this and this is</text>
  <text start="209.44" dur="4.65">why they didn&amp;#39;t take it whatsoever now</text>
  <text start="212.38" dur="3.63">in a previous report i mentioned that</text>
  <text start="214.09" dur="3.869">ohio i think this might have been</text>
  <text start="216.01" dur="6.39">yesterday day before that they were</text>
  <text start="217.959" dur="6.84">doing a no refusal blood draw checking</text>
  <text start="222.4" dur="4.95">for those people who are intoxicated and</text>
  <text start="224.799" dur="4.44">if you refused a breathalyzer test they</text>
  <text start="227.35" dur="3.539">would be allowed to take blood from you</text>
  <text start="229.239" dur="4.201">as long as they got a warrant and they</text>
  <text start="230.889" dur="3.871">were already set up to do this but</text>
  <text start="233.44" dur="3.72">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this</text>
  <text start="234.76" dur="4.11">entire thing is that the National</text>
  <text start="237.16" dur="5.31">Highway Traffic Safety Administration</text>
  <text start="238.87" dur="5.82">has been offering grants and toolkits to</text>
  <text start="242.47" dur="3.93">state and local government agencies in</text>
  <text start="244.69" dur="4.409">an effort to encourage them to begin</text>
  <text start="246.4" dur="4.08">conducting these no refusal weekend</text>
  <text start="249.099" dur="2.7">checkpoints which is very interesting</text>
  <text start="250.48" dur="3.72">where they&amp;#39;re collecting your blood your</text>
  <text start="251.799" dur="5.071">DNA and all the information to be fed</text>
  <text start="254.2" dur="4.469">into their databases and you could see</text>
  <text start="256.87" dur="5.7">this is starting at a federal level</text>
  <text start="258.669" dur="9.331">which actually when you look at it works</text>
  <text start="262.57" dur="7.38">in accordance with the Real ID that DHS</text>
  <text start="268" dur="3.69">is doing right now we can see that DHS</text>
  <text start="269.95" dur="3.44">has been infiltrating all the local law</text>
  <text start="271.69" dur="4.85">enforcement by giving them grants</text>
  <text start="273.39" dur="5.94">gifts and money and technology machine</text>
  <text start="276.54" dur="4.35">guns armored vehicles and we can see the</text>
  <text start="279.33" dur="4.11">same things happening right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="280.89" dur="4.44">giving them grants and saying yes do</text>
  <text start="283.44" dur="3.78">this you&amp;#39;ll receive more money and it</text>
  <text start="285.33" dur="5.1">looks like they&amp;#39;re in the process of</text>
  <text start="287.22" dur="4.83">getting people used to the idea that yes</text>
  <text start="290.43" dur="3.81">if you&amp;#39;re stopped and you refuse a</text>
  <text start="292.05" dur="4.65">breathalyzer test they could just take</text>
  <text start="294.24" dur="4.65">your blood and they can detain you even</text>
  <text start="296.7" dur="4.35">though you are not driving intoxicated</text>
  <text start="298.89" dur="4.2">you don&amp;#39;t show any signs of it</text>
  <text start="301.05" dur="4.71">whatsoever and it seems like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="303.09" dur="4.77">trying to kind of brainwash everyone and</text>
  <text start="305.76" dur="4.83">get us convinced that this is okay it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="4.83">not in violation of any of your rights</text>
  <text start="310.59" dur="6.39">whatsoever and it seems like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="312.69" dur="6.96">really pushing this hard okay now as we</text>
  <text start="316.98" dur="5.16">can see new york and new jersey were</text>
  <text start="319.65" dur="4.41">like kinda in lockdown where they had a</text>
  <text start="322.14" dur="4.53">couple of Ebola patients and the doctor</text>
  <text start="324.06" dur="4.14">that was coming from Liberia came up</text>
  <text start="326.67" dur="2.67">here they went through the enhanced</text>
  <text start="328.2" dur="2.7">screening and they found absolutely</text>
  <text start="329.34" dur="3.66">nothing that was allowed to roam around</text>
  <text start="330.9" dur="4.08">New York and of course how good is the</text>
  <text start="333" dur="4.23">hint how good is the enhanced screening</text>
  <text start="334.98" dur="4.71">if they couldn&amp;#39;t find anything actually</text>
  <text start="337.23" dur="5.4">not that good and the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="339.69" dur="5.64">they knew that he was coming from an</text>
  <text start="342.63" dur="5.34">area where there was a bola he was</text>
  <text start="345.33" dur="4.26">treating Ebola patients and they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="347.97" dur="3.78">have the common sense to say you know</text>
  <text start="349.59" dur="5.16">what let&amp;#39;s keep him for a little while</text>
  <text start="351.75" dur="5.61">and check them out to make sure but from</text>
  <text start="354.75" dur="5.28">all of this and everything that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="357.36" dur="6.21">on we see very strange things of course</text>
  <text start="360.03" dur="5.01">the CDC all the protocols that they have</text>
  <text start="363.57" dur="3.48">completely make no sense whatsoever</text>
  <text start="365.04" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;ve been dealing this for about a</text>
  <text start="367.05" dur="3.75">year in West Africa and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="369.12" dur="3.92">figure out that ebolas contagious but</text>
  <text start="370.8" dur="4.77">the other thing is is that Obama of</text>
  <text start="373.04" dur="5.86">course everyone realizes this he creates</text>
  <text start="375.57" dur="5.73">a strike team to come in after the fact</text>
  <text start="378.9" dur="5.66">almost like the police force or the SWAT</text>
  <text start="381.3" dur="6.78">team they&amp;#39;re not going to protect you</text>
  <text start="384.56" dur="6.85">from getting Ebola what they do is they</text>
  <text start="388.08" dur="6.69">come in afterwards and they clean up the</text>
  <text start="391.41" dur="6.06">situation so how does this prevent</text>
  <text start="394.77" dur="7.29">anything from going on here it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="397.47" dur="6.06">and again what happens this winter when</text>
  <text start="402.06" dur="3.72">we have a lot of flu victims who have</text>
  <text start="403.53" dur="3.37">temperature you&amp;#39;re going to see military</text>
  <text start="405.78" dur="3.91">task force</text>
  <text start="406.9" dur="5.04">show up on everyone&amp;#39;s door step because</text>
  <text start="409.69" dur="4.8">they might have Ebola what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="411.94" dur="4.11">right now makes no sense now we have to</text>
  <text start="414.49" dur="4.35">look at the agendas what are they</text>
  <text start="416.05" dur="5.459">actually doing here it seems like the</text>
  <text start="418.84" dur="4.5">CDC seems like they&amp;#39;re taking their</text>
  <text start="421.509" dur="3.391">direction from the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="423.34" dur="3.75">this is why things seems very very</text>
  <text start="424.9" dur="3.93">confused and they&amp;#39;re not telling people</text>
  <text start="427.09" dur="3.57">to cover up to take precautions of</text>
  <text start="428.83" dur="4.14">course now they are because of the</text>
  <text start="430.66" dur="3.66">public outcry but before they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="432.97" dur="3.12">think of it on their own but it looked</text>
  <text start="434.32" dur="3.06">like they were confused in what they</text>
  <text start="436.09" dur="3.329">were saying it looks like they were</text>
  <text start="437.38" dur="5.06">getting instructions from another area</text>
  <text start="439.419" dur="5.431">and we can see this is most likely an</text>
  <text start="442.44" dur="5.349">agenda where they&amp;#39;re pushing it very</text>
  <text start="444.85" dur="5.069">hard to convince everyone that Ebola is</text>
  <text start="447.789" dur="4.951">here in the United States now one of the</text>
  <text start="449.919" dur="4.291">agendas is to vaccinate everyone and</text>
  <text start="452.74" dur="3.57">make it mandatory and we can see right</text>
  <text start="454.21" dur="5.01">now the drug companies are trying to get</text>
  <text start="456.31" dur="5.1">their vaccines indemnified where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="459.22" dur="4.68">not held responsible for whatever</text>
  <text start="461.41" dur="4.62">happens to you or whatever is inside of</text>
  <text start="463.9" dur="4.26">these vaccines and it seems like the</text>
  <text start="466.03" dur="3.84">drug companies are pushing that right</text>
  <text start="468.16" dur="4.08">now and they have to keep the fear up in</text>
  <text start="469.87" dur="4.65">America because without the fear you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="472.24" dur="4.02">not going to want to get the vaccine so</text>
  <text start="474.52" dur="3.929">we can see how this agenda is being</text>
  <text start="476.26" dur="4.62">pushed really really hard right now in</text>
  <text start="478.449" dur="3.631">this strike team makes no sense</text>
  <text start="480.88" dur="2.64">whatsoever because it doesn&amp;#39;t prevent</text>
  <text start="482.08" dur="4.019">anything if you really wanted to prevent</text>
  <text start="483.52" dur="5.61">something he would put a travel ban on</text>
  <text start="486.099" dur="5.371">the flights coming from West Africa they</text>
  <text start="489.13" dur="3.45">would track those patients because you</text>
  <text start="491.47" dur="2.4">know where they&amp;#39;re coming from because</text>
  <text start="492.58" dur="3.269">you have the tickets you know what</text>
  <text start="493.87" dur="4.769">flights they took before because you</text>
  <text start="495.849" dur="5.25">have the database of their flight</text>
  <text start="498.639" dur="6">itinerary and you can track yes they</text>
  <text start="501.099" dur="4.831">flew from West Africa up to Japan and</text>
  <text start="504.639" dur="3.331">then over to the United States you can</text>
  <text start="505.93" dur="3.93">easily find this information out but</text>
  <text start="507.97" dur="3.629">again they&amp;#39;re not doing this because</text>
  <text start="509.86" dur="4.109">they don&amp;#39;t want to stop the flow of</text>
  <text start="511.599" dur="4.981">traffic to West Africa because as we can</text>
  <text start="513.969" dur="4.651">see Ebola is hitting only those</text>
  <text start="516.58" dur="3.78">countries where China and Russia are and</text>
  <text start="518.62" dur="3.9">there is huge amount of natural resource</text>
  <text start="520.36" dur="4.95">discoveries and of course in Liberia as</text>
  <text start="522.52" dur="5.55">we know that is open for bidding for</text>
  <text start="525.31" dur="5.13">companies to come in and extract their</text>
  <text start="528.07" dur="4.17">natural resources and we can see troops</text>
  <text start="530.44" dur="4.589">are on the standby they are ready</text>
  <text start="532.24" dur="4.65">outside of Liberia some are already in</text>
  <text start="535.029" dur="5.761">their UK has troops coming in there and</text>
  <text start="536.89" dur="6.57">the real test of all this is when all</text>
  <text start="540.79" dur="6.33">this is all said and done and Ebola is</text>
  <text start="543.46" dur="5.25">contained do those troops come out of</text>
  <text start="547.12" dur="3.72">these countries and this is something we</text>
  <text start="548.71" dur="4.5">have to watch very carefully because i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="550.84" dur="4.86">going to say they&amp;#39;re probably the most</text>
  <text start="553.21" dur="3.66">likely going to be staying inside of</text>
  <text start="555.7" dur="3.6">this country and again we have to</text>
  <text start="556.87" dur="5.85">remember that remark of that UN</text>
  <text start="559.3" dur="5.07">Ambassador to Liberia where that</text>
  <text start="562.72" dur="3.69">ambassador was out there saying listen</text>
  <text start="564.37" dur="4.29">these troops are coming here not to</text>
  <text start="566.41" dur="4.8">overthrow the government ally of Liberia</text>
  <text start="568.66" dur="5.31">and that is a very strange remark to say</text>
  <text start="571.21" dur="6.72">and what would make bu ambassador even</text>
  <text start="573.97" dur="6.09">think this or to say that now NATO is</text>
  <text start="577.93" dur="4.32">still out there and they are claiming</text>
  <text start="580.06" dur="4.41">that Russia still has troops on the</text>
  <text start="582.25" dur="5.13">border of Ukraine they haven&amp;#39;t withdraw</text>
  <text start="584.47" dur="4.59">all their troops and of course Russia is</text>
  <text start="587.38" dur="3.87">allowed to keep troops wherever they</text>
  <text start="589.06" dur="3.54">want especially on the border United</text>
  <text start="591.25" dur="4.5">States has troops on the border and</text>
  <text start="592.6" dur="5.07">again they show no proof to say look</text>
  <text start="595.75" dur="3.9">look how many troops there are they just</text>
  <text start="597.67" dur="4.95">continually out there saying this a NATO</text>
  <text start="599.65" dur="4.56">continues to claims continues their</text>
  <text start="602.62" dur="3.63">claims that Russia still has troops</text>

  <text start="699.43" dur="4.83">assets in their building the wall which</text>

  <text start="706.269" dur="4.101">to happen already yachts in York was out</text>
  <text start="708.01" dur="5.22">there saying they are planning on</text>
  <text start="710.37" dur="4.54">terrorist attacks during the election of</text>

  <text start="714.91" dur="6.799">not going to be voting in the election</text>
  <text start="717.36" dur="9.039">now it looks like the Washington Post is</text>
  <text start="721.709" dur="6.671">a basically going on that propaganda of</text>
  <text start="726.399" dur="4.081">chemical weapons used by the Islamic</text>
  <text start="728.38" dur="6.3">state and they&amp;#39;re trying to merge that</text>
  <text start="730.48" dur="7.14">with Assad the Post editorial titled</text>
  <text start="734.68" dur="6.24">Obama gives syria&amp;#39;s assad another pass</text>
  <text start="737.62" dur="5.219">on chemical weapons seizes on the recent</text>
  <text start="740.92" dur="4.32">reports for use of chlorine weapons by</text>
  <text start="742.839" dur="3.99">the Islamic state to press for the</text>
  <text start="745.24" dur="4.289">overthrow of the Assad regime in Syria</text>
  <text start="746.829" dur="4.831">the paper states quite bluntly that the</text>
  <text start="749.529" dur="4.56">Assad regime is once again blatantly</text>
  <text start="751.66" dur="4.11">violating the red line drawn by mr.</text>
  <text start="754.089" dur="3.511">Obama against the use of chemical</text>
  <text start="755.77" dur="4.53">weapons so what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="757.6" dur="5.19">right now is they&amp;#39;re trying to make the</text>
  <text start="760.3" dur="5.22">case that the Islamic state and a start</text>
  <text start="762.79" dur="4.799">are working together they have the</text>
  <text start="765.52" dur="4.41">chlorine weapons they&amp;#39;re being used in</text>
  <text start="767.589" dur="4.5">this area and they&amp;#39;re trying to link in</text>
  <text start="769.93" dur="4.11">any way they possibly can but they</text>
  <text start="772.089" dur="4.111">really can&amp;#39;t do it because it really</text>
  <text start="774.04" dur="4.799">makes no sense at this point and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="776.2" dur="5.73">still out there doing this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="778.839" dur="7.981">trying to find some links somehow some</text>
  <text start="781.93" dur="6.779">way so they can go in and remove Assad</text>
  <text start="786.82" dur="4.829">and of course they&amp;#39;re putting everything</text>
  <text start="788.709" dur="4.591">into place right now and that shows me</text>
  <text start="791.649" dur="3.901">that they&amp;#39;re getting ready for some</text>
  <text start="793.3" dur="4.32">major major event just like the Islamic</text>
  <text start="795.55" dur="4.349">state has warned the journalists that</text>
  <text start="797.62" dur="4.469">they&amp;#39;re going to be kidnapped if they</text>
  <text start="799.899" dur="4.351">anywhere in the world and especially if</text>
  <text start="802.089" dur="3.75">they come to Iraq and Syria and to me it</text>
  <text start="804.25" dur="3.26">seems like they&amp;#39;re trying to make the</text>
  <text start="805.839" dur="3.651">journalist very nervous about</text>
  <text start="807.51" dur="4.98">going into this area because it seems</text>
  <text start="809.49" dur="4.62">like the United States UK Israel the</text>
  <text start="812.49" dur="3.6">other Arab nations are planning</text>
  <text start="814.11" dur="4.23">something very very big because we</text>
  <text start="816.09" dur="4.83">already see the troop buildup in Iraq</text>
  <text start="818.34" dur="4.47">they kicked out the Iraqi forces from an</text>
  <text start="820.92" dur="3.48">airbase the United States have taken it</text>
  <text start="822.81" dur="3.3">over they&amp;#39;re setting up a division</text>
  <text start="824.4" dur="3.51">headquarters that can support 10 30</text>
  <text start="826.11" dur="3.78">thousand soldiers we have word that</text>
  <text start="827.91" dur="4.65">thirteen thousand soldiers are headed</text>
  <text start="829.89" dur="6.24">towards Iraq and we can sue already they</text>
  <text start="832.56" dur="7.5">are training the Free Syrian Army rebels</text>
  <text start="836.13" dur="7.32">to be on defense only and this way they</text>
  <text start="840.06" dur="6.48">can bring in US forces to help them in</text>
  <text start="843.45" dur="5.07">the area inside of Syria and we can see</text>
  <text start="846.54" dur="3.09">exactly what they&amp;#39;re trying to do and of</text>
  <text start="848.52" dur="3.51">course they&amp;#39;re still trying to convince</text>
  <text start="849.63" dur="5.04">everyone they need a no-fly zone even</text>
  <text start="852.03" dur="5.19">though Syria kind of did a little bit</text>
  <text start="854.67" dur="4.26">you know check to the United States</text>
  <text start="857.22" dur="3.09">saying listen we destroyed those planes</text>
  <text start="858.93" dur="4.11">so there&amp;#39;s no reason for a no-fly zone</text>
  <text start="860.31" dur="6.24">because now the Islamic state has no air</text>
  <text start="863.04" dur="5.76">force whatsoever now with this whole</text>
  <text start="866.55" dur="3.24">Ebola crisis what&amp;#39;s very interesting it</text>
  <text start="868.8" dur="3.69">seems like there&amp;#39;s a lot of propaganda</text>
  <text start="869.79" dur="6.27">coming out there now and it says that</text>
  <text start="872.49" dur="6.77">the Ebola crisis is rekindles concerns</text>
  <text start="876.06" dur="6.21">about secret research in Russian</text>
  <text start="879.26" dur="5.5">military labs and it seems like now</text>
  <text start="882.27" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re trying to link Ebola to Russia</text>
  <text start="884.76" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re doing everything they possibly</text>
  <text start="886.53" dur="6.06">can to demonize Russia make Russia</text>
  <text start="889.98" dur="4.74">responsible for Ebola the question is</text>
  <text start="892.59" dur="4.56">what would be the purpose of Russia</text>

  <text start="913.68" dur="5.28">murud and Tulane University carried out</text>
  <text start="916.35" dur="5.28">research that is illegal in the US they</text>
