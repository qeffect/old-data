  <text start="101.909" dur="5.791">into the economic collapse news and</text>
  <text start="105.21" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;re going to head out to Greece and we</text>
  <text start="107.7" dur="5.58">know that Greece is having major major</text>
  <text start="110.1" dur="7.17">problems with dead with unemployment and</text>
  <text start="113.28" dur="7.11">right now the Greek people are forty</text>
  <text start="117.27" dur="8.489">percent poorer than they were in 2008</text>
  <text start="120.39" dur="10.47">and we have to remember the eurozone is</text>
  <text start="125.759" dur="8.431">been giving them bailout money but</text>
  <text start="130.86" dur="6.75">asking them to provide cuts lay off</text>
  <text start="134.19" dur="6.48">people and we can see this model does</text>
  <text start="137.61" dur="6.45">not work they are not</text>
  <text start="140.67" dur="5.1">better off than they were when they</text>
  <text start="144.06" dur="5.24">weren&amp;#39;t getting bailouts actually</text>
  <text start="145.77" dur="6.63">they&amp;#39;re much much worse unemployment is</text>
  <text start="149.3" dur="6.22">continually rising they have so much</text>
  <text start="152.4" dur="5.25">debt now they can&amp;#39;t pay it back and what</text>
  <text start="155.52" dur="5.42">they&amp;#39;ve done is they&amp;#39;ve really bankrupt</text>
  <text start="157.65" dur="6.57">the country and we are definitely seeing</text>
  <text start="160.94" dur="4.78">this happen not just in Greece it will</text>
  <text start="164.22" dur="3.239">be happening in Cyprus it will be</text>
  <text start="165.72" dur="4.29">happening in France and Spain and</text>
  <text start="167.459" dur="6.151">Portugal all across Europe and then</text>
  <text start="170.01" dur="8.33">eventually in the u.s. because we are</text>
  <text start="173.61" dur="7.82">all following the same exact model and</text>
  <text start="178.34" dur="6.1">because of people not working in Greece</text>
  <text start="181.43" dur="7.33">their disposable incomes fell by almost</text>
  <text start="184.44" dur="6.93">thirty percent and since they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="188.76" dur="5.28">extra money those businesses that sell</text>
  <text start="191.37" dur="4.47">TVs and all those other things no one is</text>
  <text start="194.04" dur="3.96">going to go out and buy those so those</text>
  <text start="195.84" dur="5.49">stores closed down and you pretty much</text>
  <text start="198" dur="6.09">have a domino effect and it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="201.33" dur="5.1">completely unsustainable and cannot be</text>
  <text start="204.09" dur="4.35">sustained and this is why we see this</text>
  <text start="206.43" dur="4.74">happening and they can get another 12</text>
  <text start="208.44" dur="6">different bailouts it would not make any</text>
  <text start="211.17" dur="5.939">type of difference at this time here in</text>
  <text start="214.44" dur="5.16">the US I&amp;#39;ve been discussing in my</text>
  <text start="217.109" dur="8.311">various reports that retail sales are</text>
  <text start="219.6" dur="8.85">slowing and Deutsche Bank they have done</text>
  <text start="225.42" dur="7.379">an analysis and they&amp;#39;re seeing that mall</text>
  <text start="228.45" dur="7.2">traffic is declining and it is much</text>
  <text start="232.799" dur="4.981">lower than it was compared to other</text>
  <text start="235.65" dur="6.2">years because what they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="237.78" dur="6.84">stores like Macy&amp;#39;s Kohl&amp;#39;s JC Penney</text>
  <text start="241.85" dur="5.199">Nordstrom&amp;#39;s the big anchor source that</text>
  <text start="244.62" dur="5.369">you see in malls are reporting that</text>
  <text start="247.049" dur="5.791">their sales are declining and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="249.989" dur="6.271">seeing is people are not shopping at</text>
  <text start="252.84" dur="6.54">those stores but shopping at discount</text>
  <text start="256.26" dur="7.08">stores instead because their money goes</text>
  <text start="259.38" dur="5.67">further and all of this that you can see</text>
  <text start="263.34" dur="6.03">that you know what what is going on here</text>
  <text start="265.05" dur="7.77">is that here in the US disposable income</text>
  <text start="269.37" dur="5.01">is being reduced because of high</text>
  <text start="272.82" dur="5.12">unemployment</text>
  <text start="274.38" dur="6.69">hi underemployment and people who have</text>
  <text start="277.94" dur="5.68">that used to have full time jobs are now</text>
  <text start="281.07" dur="5.16">working one two or three part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="283.62" dur="4.35">and still not making the same amount of</text>
  <text start="286.23" dur="3.81">money that they were making when they</text>
  <text start="287.97" dur="3.66">had the full time job and then you have</text>
  <text start="290.04" dur="3.72">those who just do not look anymore</text>
  <text start="291.63" dur="6.42">because there are just no jobs out there</text>
  <text start="293.76" dur="6.48">that that that they can find at this</text>
  <text start="298.05" dur="5.46">time and right now we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="300.24" dur="6.15">department store revenues have fallen by</text>
  <text start="303.51" dur="6.78">a negative three-point-two percent and</text>
  <text start="306.39" dur="6.84">we&amp;#39;re seeing that many retail stores and</text>
  <text start="310.29" dur="6.33">many financial analysts are saying that</text>
  <text start="313.23" dur="5.28">this holiday season these stores are not</text>
  <text start="316.62" dur="5.4">going to do well and we&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="318.51" dur="7.43">going to see many many of them closed</text>
  <text start="322.02" dur="8.01">down now we got the unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="325.94" dur="7.03">they came out and lo and behold they</text>
  <text start="330.03" dur="5.31">were below expectation and but</text>
  <text start="332.97" dur="5.79">unemployment rate drops by seven point</text>
  <text start="335.34" dur="5.64">two percent so they expected a hundred</text>
  <text start="338.76" dur="4.32">and eighty thousand jobs but they only</text>
  <text start="340.98" dur="3.71">received one hundred and forty eight and</text>
  <text start="343.08" dur="4.65">we know this is all completely rigged</text>
  <text start="344.69" dur="5.11">and the unemployment rate now has</text>
  <text start="347.73" dur="5.46">dropped and this was before the shutdown</text>
  <text start="349.8" dur="5.61">of the government so now what what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="353.19" dur="4.14">going to see next time is they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="355.41" dur="4.08">to make the case that because of the</text>
  <text start="357.33" dur="3.99">shutdown unemployment is either going to</text>
  <text start="359.49" dur="4.92">stay the same or inch up a little bit</text>
  <text start="361.32" dur="6.33">showing that the shutdown really had an</text>
  <text start="364.41" dur="5.85">effect you know those 16 days really had</text>
  <text start="367.65" dur="5.22">an effect on the economy because let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="370.26" dur="4.23">use our common sense here the government</text>
  <text start="372.87" dur="3.93">was shut down and only about six percent</text>
  <text start="374.49" dur="5.07">of it was actually shut down all the</text>
  <text start="376.8" dur="5.19">non-essential people were shut down and</text>
  <text start="379.56" dur="4.98">they didn&amp;#39;t give the payout to the</text>
  <text start="381.99" dur="5.1">employees that they furloughed but they</text>
  <text start="384.54" dur="5.22">gave them back pay and some employees</text>
  <text start="387.09" dur="5.13">even got to receive unemployment and</text>
  <text start="389.76" dur="5.46">keep the unemployment plus their back</text>
  <text start="392.22" dur="4.53">pay so yeah that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense why</text>
  <text start="395.22" dur="5.94">that would have any effect on the</text>
  <text start="396.75" dur="6.66">economy for 16 days and let&amp;#39;s see they</text>
  <text start="401.16" dur="3.93">paid people to move barriers back and</text>
  <text start="403.41" dur="3.33">forth to close the national monuments</text>
  <text start="405.09" dur="2.79">where there were no one there was no one</text>
  <text start="406.74" dur="3.45">there anyhow so</text>
  <text start="407.88" dur="4.68">that didn&amp;#39;t do anything they kept the</text>
  <text start="410.19" dur="4.74">servers running for all the websites and</text>
  <text start="412.56" dur="4.29">put up a splash page and I proved that</text>
  <text start="414.93" dur="3.54">all these servers and everything we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="416.85" dur="3.9">running so they didn&amp;#39;t even shut that</text>
  <text start="418.47" dur="5.4">down to to save money so everything was</text>
  <text start="420.75" dur="5.25">up and running and so what effect does</text>
  <text start="423.87" dur="4.68">this have on the economy wait the Fed</text>
  <text start="426" dur="4.8">nope the Fed was still printing 85</text>
  <text start="428.55" dur="3.87">billion dollars a month pouring actually</text>
  <text start="430.8" dur="3.96">probably a lot more but that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="432.42" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re telling us pouring that money</text>
  <text start="434.76" dur="5.48">buying up the toxic real estate buying</text>
  <text start="436.62" dur="8.13">the Treasury bonds so what actually is</text>
  <text start="440.24" dur="7.42">the problem here of these 16 days I mean</text>
  <text start="444.75" dur="5.52">the Fed is even blaming the September</text>
  <text start="447.66" dur="6.75">taper on the shutdown that happened in</text>
  <text start="450.27" dur="7.86">October it doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense this</text>
  <text start="454.41" dur="6.15">is all baloney it&amp;#39;s an illusion to throw</text>
  <text start="458.13" dur="5.55">everyone off the track and make people</text>
  <text start="460.56" dur="6.36">believe that the economy is declining</text>
  <text start="463.68" dur="6.32">right now but we know better we know</text>
  <text start="466.92" dur="6.18">this was happening back in the summer</text>
  <text start="470" dur="5.49">even back further than that and this is</text>
  <text start="473.1" dur="6.45">why they were out there using propaganda</text>
  <text start="475.49" dur="6.07">them to convince everyone that this was</text>
  <text start="479.55" dur="4.35">get the economy was getting better</text>
  <text start="481.56" dur="5.16">because they thought they had the Syrian</text>
  <text start="483.9" dur="4.8">event in the bag and this is what they</text>
  <text start="486.72" dur="4.85">were going to use for the collapse and</text>
  <text start="488.7" dur="7.14">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="491.57" dur="8.77">they&amp;#39;re back in July and August there</text>
  <text start="495.84" dur="7.17">were 80 9.9 million people who are no</text>
  <text start="500.34" dur="6.63">longer in the labor force and that grew</text>
  <text start="503.01" dur="9.36">in August to 90 million to 90.4 million</text>
  <text start="506.97" dur="8.67">and now in September it grew from 90.4</text>
  <text start="512.37" dur="5.79">million to 90 point six million and that</text>
  <text start="515.64" dur="6.63">is an increase of 136 thousand people</text>
  <text start="518.16" dur="6.21">and we have to look at this these people</text>
  <text start="522.27" dur="4.41">are no longer in the labor force because</text>
  <text start="524.37" dur="3.84">there is no job they&amp;#39;ve given up there</text>
  <text start="526.68" dur="3.96">is nothing out there that continually</text>
  <text start="528.21" dur="4.41">sending resumes out getting no responses</text>
  <text start="530.64" dur="5.07">I know a couple of people that are in</text>
  <text start="532.62" dur="6.87">the technology industry and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="535.71" dur="5.02">sending resumes out like five to ten a</text>
  <text start="539.49" dur="4.18">week</text>
  <text start="540.73" dur="5.07">and most of them are headhunters or</text>
  <text start="543.67" dur="4.38">consulting firms that you know place you</text>
  <text start="545.8" dur="4.68">in jobs and it seems like they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="548.05" dur="4.77">collecting people&amp;#39;s names and resumes</text>
  <text start="550.48" dur="5.75">but never coming back and responding to</text>
  <text start="552.82" dur="6.72">these people with any type of job and</text>
  <text start="556.23" dur="6.31">this is just this just goes to show you</text>
  <text start="559.54" dur="4.68">that there is no work out there and we</text>
  <text start="562.54" dur="6.419">have to remember when President Obama</text>
  <text start="564.22" dur="8.45">took office back in January 2009 it was</text>
  <text start="568.959" dur="9.301">80 point five million people that were</text>
  <text start="572.67" dur="10.779">not in the labor force and today it is</text>
  <text start="578.26" dur="8.16">increased by 10.1 million during Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="583.449" dur="7.771">presidency so we can see what the</text>
  <text start="586.42" dur="9.479">problem is here now I said in the past</text>
  <text start="591.22" dur="8.07">that the United States is using military</text>
  <text start="595.899" dur="5.341">might to keep the dollar prompt up and</text>
  <text start="599.29" dur="3.84">we understand this that we&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="601.24" dur="4.44">United States is in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="603.13" dur="4.17">moving into Africa to capture the</text>
  <text start="605.68" dur="2.73">natural resources we understand this and</text>
  <text start="607.3" dur="4.95">we understand that China and Russia</text>
  <text start="608.41" dur="5.58">right now are using their negotiation</text>
  <text start="612.25" dur="7.47">abilities and they&amp;#39;re making deals</text>
  <text start="613.99" dur="9">without using soldiers to usher in the</text>
  <text start="619.72" dur="5.94">next world reserve currency and what</text>
  <text start="622.99" dur="5.849">we&amp;#39;re seeing and just to say this the</text>
  <text start="625.66" dur="5.039">u.s. did this in the 70s where they</text>
  <text start="628.839" dur="4.321">actually made deals they didn&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="630.699" dur="5.64">military might they were making deals</text>
  <text start="633.16" dur="6.84">all over the place and to become the</text>
  <text start="636.339" dur="6.99">u.s. reserve currency in 1971 when uh</text>
  <text start="640" dur="6.3">Nixon took the country off the gold</text>
  <text start="643.329" dur="7.38">standard and stole all the other nations</text>
  <text start="646.3" dur="6.93">gold and at that time they were making</text>
  <text start="650.709" dur="4.32">deals all over the place to back it up</text>
  <text start="653.23" dur="5.039">with the petro dollar now it was that</text>
  <text start="655.029" dur="6.571">the right thing no but we can see China</text>
  <text start="658.269" dur="6.081">right now making deals all over the</text>
  <text start="661.6" dur="6.12">place and they have just made another</text>
  <text start="664.35" dur="5.56">deal with Singapore and they have agreed</text>
  <text start="667.72" dur="6.52">to trade their currencies directly</text>
  <text start="669.91" dur="7.03">making South East Asian city</text>
  <text start="674.24" dur="4.349">offshore hub for the Chinese you want</text>
  <text start="676.94" dur="3.87">and we have to remember they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="678.589" dur="4.741">this with Kenya also where they are a</text>
  <text start="680.81" dur="5.73">clearinghouse and what this means is</text>
  <text start="683.33" dur="9.24">they are going to bypass the US dollar</text>
  <text start="686.54" dur="10.02">and right now the UK is easing their</text>
  <text start="692.57" dur="7.17">rules for Chinese banks and they want</text>
  <text start="696.56" dur="6.54">them to come in and set up in London</text>
  <text start="699.74" dur="6.45">because they understand mmm I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="703.1" dur="6.06">how much longer the US dollar is going</text>
  <text start="706.19" dur="5.91">to be the reserve currency so we better</text>
  <text start="709.16" dur="4.86">cover ourselves and bring in the Chinese</text>
  <text start="712.1" dur="4.23">banks the same things happening with</text>
  <text start="714.02" dur="4.74">Australia the same thing in North Korea</text>
  <text start="716.33" dur="6.449">Brazil all these different areas</text>
  <text start="718.76" dur="5.94">everyone is making deals and doing</text>
  <text start="722.779" dur="4.921">things that they normally would not do</text>
  <text start="724.7" dur="6.18">and another move to promote the yuan</text>
  <text start="727.7" dur="6.42">globally the country agreed on a current</text>
  <text start="730.88" dur="7.29">currency swap with the you the EU</text>
  <text start="734.12" dur="8.07">earlier in the month and this was a 350</text>

  <text start="1102.8" dur="5.33">have lots of weapons because we have to</text>

  <text start="1566.99" dur="5.16">propped up it will become it will start</text>
  <text start="1570.17" dur="4.41">to collapse and they understand this and</text>
  <text start="1572.15" dur="5.13">this is why they need to get into Syria</text>
  <text start="1574.58" dur="7.77">and Iran and now they&amp;#39;re making the move</text>
  <text start="1577.28" dur="7.86">saying they need Assad out okay let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1582.35" dur="5.79">move on here now we understand that</text>
  <text start="1585.14" dur="5.52">sistah is still pending in the Senate</text>
  <text start="1588.14" dur="5.13">that bill is waiting for the perfect</text>
  <text start="1590.66" dur="5.31">event to happen and it&amp;#39;s just sitting</text>
  <text start="1593.27" dur="8.46">there waiting and what is happening</text>
  <text start="1595.97" dur="8.28">right now is that is that cyber attack</text>
  <text start="1601.73" dur="5.94">information is only supposed to be</text>
  <text start="1604.25" dur="4.83">shared in emergency so they would have</text>
  <text start="1607.67" dur="5.04">to wait</text>
  <text start="1609.08" dur="5.4">were a cyber attack to occur and then</text>
  <text start="1612.71" dur="5.34">the private companies can share their</text>
  <text start="1614.48" dur="6.66">information what this bill wants to do</text>
  <text start="1618.05" dur="6.39">is make it so these companies are</text>
  <text start="1621.14" dur="5.46">legally protected and they&amp;#39;re able to</text>
  <text start="1624.44" dur="4.89">share the information before the attack</text>
  <text start="1626.6" dur="5.43">happens so we can kind of figure out</text>
  <text start="1629.33" dur="5.94">what they&amp;#39;re going to try to do they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1632.03" dur="5.04">going to create a cyber attack event and</text>
  <text start="1635.27" dur="4.95">we know this is coming do we know</text>
  <text start="1637.07" dur="7.11">exactly one no we don&amp;#39;t but we do know</text>
  <text start="1640.22" dur="7.5">that something is in the works with this</text>
  <text start="1644.18" dur="7.74">event it will allow them to say listen</text>
  <text start="1647.72" dur="6.81">we just had an event if we were able to</text>
  <text start="1651.92" dur="6.42">share information from all these</text>
  <text start="1654.53" dur="6.36">companies and if we passed sista we</text>
  <text start="1658.34" dur="4.65">could have prevented this cyber attack</text>
  <text start="1660.89" dur="4.14">from happening and this is how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1662.99" dur="4.11">probably going to play this because</text>
  <text start="1665.03" dur="4.47">right now they have to wait for after</text>
  <text start="1667.1" dur="4.68">the cyber attack to share the private</text>
  <text start="1669.5" dur="4.23">information of individuals from the</text>
  <text start="1671.78" dur="4.41">companies so this is how they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1673.73" dur="5.25">to try to rework this and we do have to</text>
  <text start="1676.19" dur="6.36">remember that the president has already</text>
  <text start="1678.98" dur="6.75">created the executive orders to support</text>
  <text start="1682.55" dur="7.14">the SIS pible and you know even though</text>
  <text start="1685.73" dur="6.63">he says he&amp;#39;s going to veto it why would</text>
  <text start="1689.69" dur="5.01">he create to the executive orders to</text>
  <text start="1692.36" dur="4.62">support it because guess what guess</text>
  <text start="1694.7" dur="5.97">what&amp;#39;s going to happen when the cyber</text>
  <text start="1696.98" dur="5.67">attack hits and it&amp;#39;s a huge event and it</text>
  <text start="1700.67" dur="3.72">brings down the financial institution</text>
  <text start="1702.65" dur="3.81">which will be the first part of the mini</text>
  <text start="1704.39" dur="3.69">collapse I&amp;#39;ve been talking about coming</text>
  <text start="1706.46" dur="4.14">up you know this late fall early winter</text>
  <text start="1708.08" dur="3.96">or maybe you know into January their</text>
  <text start="1710.6" dur="3.42">deadline has been pushed back a little</text>
  <text start="1712.04" dur="5.67">bit but it&amp;#39;s going to happen don&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="1714.02" dur="5.94">worry the president was going to say he</text>
  <text start="1717.71" dur="4.98">was going to veto it but because of</text>
  <text start="1719.96" dur="5.19">these circumstances right now with this</text>
  <text start="1722.69" dur="6">horrific cyber attack that brought the</text>
  <text start="1725.15" dur="6.6">economy to its knees I am going to have</text>
  <text start="1728.69" dur="6.87">to I&amp;#39;m going to have to pass this bill</text>
  <text start="1731.75" dur="8.55">because we need the American people to</text>
  <text start="1735.56" dur="7.18">feel secure in their banking in the</text>
  <text start="1740.3" dur="5.23">financial industry and we cannot allow</text>
  <text start="1742.74" dur="6.42">another country to do this to us again</text>
  <text start="1745.53" dur="7.38">and that&amp;#39;s why he has the executive</text>
  <text start="1749.16" dur="6.99">order already set up to support the</text>
  <text start="1752.91" dur="5.22">sista bill and this is what he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1756.15" dur="5.7">to but this is the move he is going to</text>
  <text start="1758.13" dur="6.86">make and don&amp;#39;t worry it will all be for</text>
  <text start="1761.85" dur="5.94">the people and this is why he&amp;#39;s doing it</text>
  <text start="1764.99" dur="6.63">now there are many many more glitches</text>
  <text start="1767.79" dur="6.9">happening in the East Coast internet</text>
  <text start="1771.62" dur="7.689">hemisphere right here and we see Time</text>
  <text start="1774.69" dur="7.77">Warner had a massive outage in the New</text>
  <text start="1779.309" dur="6.571">York Northeast region and that included</text>
  <text start="1782.46" dur="5.94">like New York Brooklyn Astoria albany</text>
  <text start="1785.88" dur="5.76">portland flushing this whole entire area</text>
  <text start="1788.4" dur="5.43">and they had some type of outage and it</text>
  <text start="1791.64" dur="3.78">was like a glitch and people couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1793.83" dur="4.17">get their data it was just everything</text>
  <text start="1795.42" dur="4.889">was just down and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="1798" dur="4.74">due to technical issues was one of our</text>
  <text start="1800.309" dur="4.201">network backbone providers these issues</text>
  <text start="1802.74" dur="5.58">affected other internet providers in the</text>
  <text start="1804.51" dur="7.86">area also and what we did not what they</text>
  <text start="1808.32" dur="6.66">did was they rerouted the traffic and</text>
  <text start="1812.37" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re using a different system right</text>
  <text start="1814.98" dur="5.55">now the fun and they&amp;#39;re still looking</text>
  <text start="1816.51" dur="6.36">into what exactly happened now we</text>
  <text start="1820.53" dur="6.529">understand that we&amp;#39;ve been seeing many</text>
  <text start="1822.87" dur="8.28">many glitches in the Nasdaq in many huge</text>
  <text start="1827.059" dur="5.681">website companies where they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1831.15" dur="3.99">down for a little bit then they came</text>
  <text start="1832.74" dur="5.13">back up the Nasdaq has had a couple of</text>
  <text start="1835.14" dur="4.83">glitches and we can see all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="1837.87" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re all happening in the same time</text>
  <text start="1839.97" dur="4.5">period and this could have been an</text>
  <text start="1842.7" dur="4.08">introduction of some type of malware</text>
  <text start="1844.47" dur="5.01">which they it was it would cause a</text>
  <text start="1846.78" dur="4.23">hiccup for a couple seconds and then</text>
  <text start="1849.48" dur="3.93">once everything is in place everything</text>
  <text start="1851.01" dur="6.27">goes back to normal and we can see that</text>
  <text start="1853.41" dur="6.06">something is definitely getting ready</text>
  <text start="1857.28" dur="6.33">and they&amp;#39;re positioning things to happen</text>
  <text start="1859.47" dur="6.15">and a National Academies report pointed</text>
  <text start="1863.61" dur="6.15">out that cyber attacks are unlikely to</text>
  <text start="1865.62" dur="6.98">cause extended outages but if a</text>
  <text start="1869.76" dur="2.84">well-coordinated</text>
  <text start="1873.33" dur="4.98">they were well coordinated they could</text>
  <text start="1875.46" dur="5.67">magnify the damage of a physical attack</text>
  <text start="1878.31" dur="5.25">a hacker attack on the power system</text>
  <text start="1881.13" dur="4.62">could deny large regions of the country</text>
  <text start="1883.56" dur="4.64">access to bulk system power for weeks or</text>
  <text start="1885.75" dur="5.43">even months which would generate turmoil</text>
  <text start="1888.2" dur="5.38">widespread public fear and an image of</text>
  <text start="1891.18" dur="6.18">helplessness that would play directly</text>
  <text start="1893.58" dur="7.32">into the hands of the terrorists and we</text>
  <text start="1897.36" dur="6.21">see many different organizations coming</text>
  <text start="1900.9" dur="5.19">out explaining the same exact things and</text>
  <text start="1903.57" dur="6.03">we&amp;#39;re seeing we just recently saw that</text>
  <text start="1906.09" dur="6.38">there is a huge vulnerabilities in the</text>
  <text start="1909.6" dur="6.42">power grid it was brought to the DEA DHS</text>
  <text start="1912.47" dur="5.26">DHS attention and they pretty much did</text>
  <text start="1916.02" dur="5.25">nothing about it they didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1917.73" dur="7.71">acknowledge it and we can see how this</text>
  <text start="1921.27" dur="8.16">whole entire false flag event is going</text>
  <text start="1925.44" dur="8.82">to play out now we do understand that</text>
  <text start="1929.43" dur="7.68">the Food Stamp amount is going to be</text>
  <text start="1934.26" dur="4.59">reduced come November first and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1937.11" dur="5.19">approximately about forty seven point</text>
  <text start="1938.85" dur="5.75">six million Americans on food stamps and</text>
  <text start="1942.3" dur="4.74">we saw what happened when there was a</text>
  <text start="1944.6" dur="6.37">time period when there was just a little</text>
  <text start="1947.04" dur="5.97">glitch of the food stamps system and you</text>
  <text start="1950.97" dur="4.32">know they said how to do with backups</text>
  <text start="1953.01" dur="4.14">and things like that but who knows again</text>
  <text start="1955.29" dur="4.62">I mean there could have been something</text>
  <text start="1957.15" dur="5.4">being implanted at the time and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1959.91" dur="7.05">just seeing another glitch happen and we</text>
  <text start="1962.55" dur="8.79">saw how people reacted now that that</text>
  <text start="1966.96" dur="6.69">food as we know is rising it&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="1971.34" dur="5.22">food is not going down or the products</text>
  <text start="1973.65" dur="4.35">are being shrunk down in size to keep</text>
  <text start="1976.56" dur="4.02">the price the same so people are</text>
  <text start="1978" dur="4.59">receiving less of the same product and</text>
  <text start="1980.58" dur="5.25">that&amp;#39;s good example of as a browser ice</text>
  <text start="1982.59" dur="5.58">cream it&amp;#39;s no longer a half gallon it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1985.83" dur="4.59">much smaller than that and other people</text>
  <text start="1988.17" dur="3.84">have been telling me that other products</text>
  <text start="1990.42" dur="3.78">have been shrinking down I also noticed</text>
  <text start="1992.01" dur="6.09">issues where I used to get a family pack</text>
  <text start="1994.2" dur="7.32">is I took out a box compared it to the</text>
  <text start="1998.1" dur="5.87">new family size and it is much much</text>
  <text start="2001.52" dur="4.659">smaller but the price is the same and</text>
  <text start="2003.97" dur="4.65">for those</text>
  <text start="2006.179" dur="6.311">products that they have introduced sizes</text>
  <text start="2008.62" dur="6.419">we&amp;#39;ve seen prices move up so now they</text>
  <text start="2012.49" dur="6.02">are reducing the amount of money that</text>
  <text start="2015.039" dur="7.02">these people are going to receive and</text>
  <text start="2018.51" dur="6.159">right now some people have explained to</text>
  <text start="2022.059" dur="5.37">me that the food stamp money only lasts</text>
  <text start="2024.669" dur="4.89">until like the third week of October you</text>
  <text start="2027.429" dur="6.87">imagine what it would be like to have</text>
  <text start="2029.559" dur="6.99">less of the food stamp money they might</text>
  <text start="2034.299" dur="4.291">only make it two weeks now or two and a</text>
  <text start="2036.549" dur="5.191">half weeks and what everyone is</text>
  <text start="2038.59" dur="4.949">concerned about is that these people who</text>
  <text start="2041.74" dur="4.679">are on food stamps to forty seven point</text>
  <text start="2043.539" dur="9.421">six million people this might turn into</text>
  <text start="2046.419" dur="9.571">a riot type of a event where people you</text>
  <text start="2052.96" dur="6.119">know March and people demand their food</text>
  <text start="2055.99" dur="5.7">stamp money back and what is amazing is</text>
  <text start="2059.079" dur="6.981">that they cut back the food stamp</text>
  <text start="2061.69" dur="8.34">program but they have no problem sending</text>
  <text start="2066.06" dur="6.22">billions of dollars to Israel billions</text>
  <text start="2070.03" dur="4.71">of dollars to Saudi Arabia they were</text>
  <text start="2072.28" dur="4.819">sending billions of dollars to Egypt and</text>
  <text start="2074.74" dur="5.909">I think still some is still going there</text>
  <text start="2077.099" dur="7.391">they&amp;#39;re spending billions of dollars in</text>
  <text start="2080.649" dur="6.091">Yemen in Pakistan and this is what</text>
  <text start="2084.49" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re cutting out I don&amp;#39;t know about</text>
  <text start="2086.74" dur="5.22">you but i do not want my tax money going</text>
  <text start="2090.01" dur="4.74">to these other countries and we do</text>
  <text start="2091.96" dur="5.73">understand why they are sending this aid</text>
  <text start="2094.75" dur="6.03">out there it is to keep the puppet</text>
  <text start="2097.69" dur="6.419">governments in power to keep the US</text>
  <text start="2100.78" dur="6.089">dollar as a reserve currency and to keep</text>
  <text start="2104.109" dur="6.24">these governments happy and to keep</text>
  <text start="2106.869" dur="5.671">those people in the country from rising</text>
  <text start="2110.349" dur="5.371">up and overthrowing the government in</text>
  <text start="2112.54" dur="4.95">those countries and we can see what is</text>
  <text start="2115.72" dur="6.119">happening and why they are doing it</text>
  <text start="2117.49" dur="8.25">because they are losing that the dollar</text>
  <text start="2121.839" dur="7.081">is declining they are losing the battle</text>
  <text start="2125.74" dur="5.64">and it&amp;#39;s getting tougher and tougher to</text>
  <text start="2128.92" dur="3.96">keep the US dollar propped up in these</text>
  <text start="2131.38" dur="3.9">countries and this is why we see these</text>
  <text start="2132.88" dur="5.189">drone strikes and all this happening it</text>
  <text start="2135.28" dur="4.53">because it&amp;#39;s to keep the other people in</text>
  <text start="2138.069" dur="4.021">the country from rising up and over</text>
  <text start="2139.81" dur="3.63">throwing the puppet governments in these</text>
  <text start="2142.09" dur="4.47">countries and that&amp;#39;s why we see it</text>
  <text start="2143.44" dur="6.33">happening in Yemen Pakistan and all</text>
  <text start="2146.56" dur="6.09">these other countries but going back to</text>
  <text start="2149.77" dur="5.19">the food stamps we could see something</text>
  <text start="2152.65" dur="5.94">and something might happen and let me</text>
  <text start="2154.96" dur="5.91">tell you the government would really</text>
  <text start="2158.59" dur="4.89">probably want this to happen at this</text>
  <text start="2160.87" dur="4.59">point so they could declare martial law</text>
  <text start="2163.48" dur="4.47">they would enough they were like nothing</text>
  <text start="2165.46" dur="5.88">better than to do that and switch and</text>
  <text start="2167.95" dur="5.31">move all power and invoke the executive</text>
  <text start="2171.34" dur="4.8">orders and move the power to President</text>

  <text start="2197.55" dur="5.65">what he goes on to say is some political</text>
  <text start="2200.29" dur="5.31">forces are using Islam to be more</text>
  <text start="2203.2" dur="4.92">precise it&amp;#39;s radical movements that have</text>
  <text start="2205.6" dur="5.25">never been popular among Russian Russian</text>
  <text start="2208.12" dur="4.59">Muslims to weaken our state and to</text>
  <text start="2210.85" dur="6.36">create regions with foreign manage</text>
  <text start="2212.71" dur="9">conflicts on Russian territory well what</text>
  <text start="2217.21" dur="9.33">I&amp;#39;m seeing here is that central bankers</text>
  <text start="2221.71" dur="9.51">Saudi Arabia are very angry for what</text>
  <text start="2226.54" dur="7.88">Russia did with Syria that they derailed</text>
  <text start="2231.22" dur="7.41">the plan of having a war started and</text>
  <text start="2234.42" dur="9.7">they are now moving these terrorists</text>
  <text start="2238.63" dur="8.94">into Russia as a warning of not to do</text>
  <text start="2244.12" dur="7.14">this again and what we are seeing is</text>
  <text start="2247.57" dur="6.26">that back of my report oh no must have</text>
  <text start="2251.26" dur="5.76">been when ken yet when the Kenya attack</text>
  <text start="2253.83" dur="7.93">hit in the kenya mall and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="2257.02" dur="7.47">that the White Widow is the newest um</text>
  <text start="2261.76" dur="6.9">bin Laden who&amp;#39;s the leader of the AL</text>
  <text start="2264.49" dur="6.51">shappa al-shabaab a terrorist group well</text>
  <text start="2268.66" dur="4.28">right they&amp;#39;re saying now is that the</text>
  <text start="2271" dur="5.03">White Widow is suspect</text>
  <text start="2272.94" dur="7.889">did in this blast and they are building</text>
  <text start="2276.03" dur="7.98">up the case that this white wet a white</text>
  <text start="2280.829" dur="8.01">widow has reached all over the world and</text>
  <text start="2284.01" dur="6.3">can get terrorists into Russia and they</text>
  <text start="2288.839" dur="3.811">are building this up because we</text>
  <text start="2290.31" dur="4.559">understand that there is going to be a</text>
  <text start="2292.65" dur="5.58">major event and there&amp;#39;s also that</text>
  <text start="2294.869" dur="6.361">warning in Uganda that there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="2298.23" dur="5.19">be another terrorist threat and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2301.23" dur="5.18">imminent and it&amp;#39;s going to happen so we</text>
  <text start="2303.42" dur="8.85">can see how they&amp;#39;re playing this out and</text>
  <text start="2306.41" dur="9.52">the question is what is going to be the</text>
  <text start="2312.27" dur="6.059">next false flag event and I said in my</text>
  <text start="2315.93" dur="4.23">other reports that it is going to be a</text>
  <text start="2318.329" dur="4.711">multiple event will probably a cyber</text>
  <text start="2320.16" dur="5.1">attack with a nuclear type of explosion</text>
  <text start="2323.04" dur="3.569">or maybe biological or chemical don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2325.26" dur="4.38">know but it looks like it might be</text>
  <text start="2326.609" dur="5.191">moving to New clear at this point and</text>
  <text start="2329.64" dur="4.65">the reason why I say this we have to</text>
  <text start="2331.8" dur="4.95">look at all the facts that we see right</text>
  <text start="2334.29" dur="5.039">now we understand that nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="2336.75" dur="7.98">were transferred without paperwork we</text>
  <text start="2339.329" dur="8.911">understand that high US Armed Forces</text>
  <text start="2344.73" dur="7.5">personnel were relieved of command that</text>
  <text start="2348.24" dur="7.23">handled the nuclear arsenals and they</text>
  <text start="2352.23" dur="5.52">were removed from their command we had</text>
  <text start="2355.47" dur="5.55">Lindsey Graham out there screaming on</text>
  <text start="2357.75" dur="7.109">the top of his lungs that Iran could be</text>
  <text start="2361.02" dur="5.79">sending over a nuclear bomb into the</text>
  <text start="2364.859" dur="8.281">harbor of Charleston or maybe into</text>
  <text start="2366.81" dur="8.519">Manhattan and we understand that they</text>
  <text start="2373.14" dur="5.219">they&amp;#39;re in the process of going through</text>
  <text start="2375.329" dur="5.01">the peace talks with Iran and Iran is</text>
  <text start="2378.359" dur="5.911">actually making a deal with the brick</text>
  <text start="2380.339" dur="7.5">nation which would then allow them to</text>
  <text start="2384.27" dur="6.72">bypass the sanctions of the u.s. so</text>
  <text start="2387.839" dur="4.711">there&amp;#39;s a small window right here and we</text>
  <text start="2390.99" dur="3.089">understand that also that Iran is not</text>
  <text start="2392.55" dur="5.279">going to go and give up their nuclear</text>
  <text start="2394.079" dur="6.931">program and there is a small window I</text>
  <text start="2397.829" dur="6.331">don&amp;#39;t sorry there&amp;#39;s also Israel who is</text>
  <text start="2401.01" dur="5.34">looking to do a a preemptive strike on</text>
  <text start="2404.16" dur="4.35">Iran without the US</text>
  <text start="2406.35" dur="4.92">but again the US has a treaty with with</text>
  <text start="2408.51" dur="4.53">Israel that if they&amp;#39;re fighting Iran us</text>
  <text start="2411.27" dur="5.58">would help out so you can see how all</text>
  <text start="2413.04" dur="8.19">this plays out so right now what is</text>
  <text start="2416.85" dur="10.05">happening is that malware has infected</text>
  <text start="2421.23" dur="8.85">the UN nuclear agency computer malicious</text>
  <text start="2426.9" dur="6.21">software infected some UN nuclear agency</text>
  <text start="2430.08" dur="6.39">computers in recent months but they</text>
  <text start="2433.11" dur="7.83">believe no data was compromised they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2436.47" dur="8.4">not exactly sure and what is what what</text>
  <text start="2440.94" dur="6.36">does this UN nuclear agency do well the</text>
  <text start="2444.87" dur="6.24">knee the UN International Atomic Energy</text>
  <text start="2447.3" dur="6.33">Agency plays a key role in global</text>
  <text start="2451.11" dur="4.35">efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear</text>
  <text start="2453.63" dur="7.94">weapons they keep track of everything</text>
  <text start="2455.46" dur="9.78">and it just so happens that they had a</text>
  <text start="2461.57" dur="6.4">malicious piece of malware introduced</text>
  <text start="2465.24" dur="7.95">into their computer networked which</text>
  <text start="2467.97" dur="8.82">either erased moved destroyed retrieved</text>
  <text start="2473.19" dur="5.91">this critical information but they</text>
  <text start="2476.79" dur="7.95">believe nothing has got or maybe it just</text>
  <text start="2479.1" dur="9.27">copied it who knows but something is</text>
  <text start="2484.74" dur="6">definitely happening right now and we</text>
  <text start="2488.37" dur="5.31">can definitely see that something is</text>
  <text start="2490.74" dur="6.84">ramping up and I&amp;#39;ve said this in many</text>
  <text start="2493.68" dur="6.84">many reports that all of this is leading</text>
  <text start="2497.58" dur="5.85">to something that&amp;#39;s going to be very big</text>
  <text start="2500.52" dur="5.91">because they understand that they tried</text>
  <text start="2503.43" dur="6.48">using false flag events in other</text>
  <text start="2506.43" dur="8.13">countries the American people just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2509.91" dur="6.78">care to go to war you can have 1700</text>
  <text start="2514.56" dur="4.92">chemical attacks biological attacks in</text>
  <text start="2516.69" dur="4.83">Syria or Iran they can scream on the top</text>
  <text start="2519.48" dur="4.11">of their lungs that Iran is going to</text>
  <text start="2521.52" dur="4.61">have a nuclear weapon and they can say</text>
  <text start="2523.59" dur="6.6">this for over 25 years but guess what</text>
  <text start="2526.13" dur="5.65">the American people don&amp;#39;t care and guess</text>
  <text start="2530.19" dur="3.87">what they have been saying it for over</text>
  <text start="2531.78" dur="4.02">25 years they&amp;#39;ve been telling us that</text>
  <text start="2534.06" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;ll have a bomb in three to five</text>
  <text start="2535.8" dur="3.51">years and they just recently came out</text>
  <text start="2538.29" dur="4.74">and said it again</text>
  <text start="2539.31" dur="7.67">but they don&amp;#39;t care the only way that</text>
  <text start="2543.03" dur="9.69">Americans will be shocked is if</text>
  <text start="2546.98" dur="8.98">something happens here on American soil</text>
  <text start="2552.72" dur="5.85">and it would have to be something that</text>
  <text start="2555.96" dur="11.1">is horrific it would be it would have to</text>
  <text start="2558.57" dur="11.82">be in the the way 911 happened it would</text>
  <text start="2567.06" dur="5.94">have to be catastrophic the building&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2570.39" dur="7.71">coming down the planes hitting planes</text>
  <text start="2573" dur="9.21">around the country creating fear that</text>
  <text start="2578.1" dur="8.75">terrorists are all over the place they</text>
  <text start="2582.21" dur="7.95">have already reported that al-qaeda are</text>
  <text start="2586.85" dur="5.52">now in lone wolf groups they can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="2590.16" dur="5.43">traced they&amp;#39;re around the country</text>
  <text start="2592.37" dur="5.86">al-shabaab has been recruiting from the</text>
  <text start="2595.59" dur="4.26">US and they are growing growing and</text>
  <text start="2598.23" dur="5.01">getting more sophisticated along with</text>
  <text start="2599.85" dur="5.88">al-qaeda the al-qaeda leader has already</text>
  <text start="2603.24" dur="6.72">issued a warning that they are going to</text>
  <text start="2605.73" dur="8.61">do small attacks on US soil now we see</text>
  <text start="2609.96" dur="7.47">all of this evidence about nuclear</text>
  <text start="2614.34" dur="6.69">weapons being moved without paperwork</text>
  <text start="2617.43" dur="6.93">we&amp;#39;re seeing US military being relieved</text>
  <text start="2621.03" dur="7.2">of command we&amp;#39;re seeing the UN nuclear</text>
  <text start="2624.36" dur="7.83">agency computer infected with a malware</text>
  <text start="2628.23" dur="8.16">type of piece of software that they are</text>
  <text start="2632.19" dur="9.09">not sure exactly what happened and we</text>
  <text start="2636.39" dur="10.11">can see that something is being set up</text>
  <text start="2641.28" dur="11.37">to create this terror that will be</text>
  <text start="2646.5" dur="8.34">coming to the US and again this is not</text>
  <text start="2652.65" dur="5.43">going to be a one-off thing we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="2654.84" dur="5.97">to most likely see a cyber attack on the</text>
  <text start="2658.08" dur="5.28">financial system and the power grid we</text>
  <text start="2660.81" dur="5.88">will see most likely some type of</text>
  <text start="2663.36" dur="6.14">nuclear detonation and it could be in</text>
  <text start="2666.69" dur="5.52">two places there could be a chemical</text>
  <text start="2669.5" dur="3.73">that nation to go along with this I mean</text>
  <text start="2672.21" dur="3.21">if we look at nine</text>
  <text start="2673.23" dur="4.65">we look at that we saw anthrax we saw</text>
  <text start="2675.42" dur="6.24">many different things happen all at once</text>
  <text start="2677.88" dur="6.6">so we need to be ready we need to</text>
  <text start="2681.66" dur="5.61">understand what is going on and we need</text>
  <text start="2684.48" dur="6.18">to call them out on this and get more</text>
  <text start="2687.27" dur="5.849">and more people to understand that these</text>
  <text start="2690.66" dur="4.59">events are coming and the more that we</text>
