  <text start="116.73" dur="6.84">into place so we can move into this new</text>
  <text start="119.97" dur="5.76">economy and the reset has already begun</text>

  <text start="125.73" dur="6.509">for it he&amp;#39;s already activated the reset</text>
  <text start="129.92" dur="5.8">now let&amp;#39;s take a look at what is really</text>
  <text start="132.239" dur="6.811">going on here when we look at the global</text>
  <text start="135.72" dur="5.82">economy the globalist ran the entire</text>
  <text start="139.05" dur="4.92">system they had all their trade deals</text>
  <text start="141.54" dur="5.88">the World Trade Organization they were</text>
  <text start="143.97" dur="6.989">trying to push the TPP and they were</text>
  <text start="147.42" dur="5.97">moving companies manufacturers out of</text>
  <text start="150.959" dur="5.011">the United States and we&amp;#39;ve known this</text>
  <text start="153.39" dur="5.16">for a very long time Trump came into</text>
  <text start="155.97" dur="4.59">office and he got rid of the TPP right</text>
  <text start="158.55" dur="3.57">off the bat he wanted to get rid of</text>
  <text start="160.56" dur="2.82">NAFTA but it would be tied up in</text>
  <text start="162.12" dur="3.48">Congress</text>
  <text start="163.38" dur="3.51">and he decided okay instead of doing</text>
  <text start="165.6" dur="4.14">that right now because that would take</text>
  <text start="166.89" dur="4.77">forever let&amp;#39;s renegotiate the deal and</text>
  <text start="169.74" dur="4.17">make it the best deal we can possibly</text>
  <text start="171.66" dur="4.59">can make it he also went out and he</text>
  <text start="173.91" dur="5.39">started to make new deals with different</text>
  <text start="176.25" dur="6.99">countries bilateral trade agreements</text>
  <text start="179.3" dur="7.35">this is the beginning stages of the</text>
  <text start="183.24" dur="7.56">reset what is happening right now the</text>
  <text start="186.65" dur="7.57">entire system of global trade and supply</text>
  <text start="190.8" dur="7.77">chain economics it has entered a state</text>
  <text start="194.22" dur="6.63">of flux now think about what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="198.57" dur="5.4">and this is why you hear the mainstream</text>
  <text start="200.85" dur="7.85">media the financial pundits the central</text>
  <text start="203.97" dur="8.37">bank system this is why they&amp;#39;re rallying</text>
  <text start="208.7" dur="6.31">against him because he&amp;#39;s taking their</text>
  <text start="212.34" dur="6.56">system and he&amp;#39;s ripping it apart right</text>
  <text start="215.01" dur="6.51">now and they&amp;#39;re starting to catch on and</text>
  <text start="218.9" dur="4.81">there&amp;#39;s getting worried of course</text>
  <text start="221.52" dur="5.58">because what they&amp;#39;re doing what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="223.71" dur="7.52">doing I should say is he&amp;#39;s ripping the</text>
  <text start="227.1" dur="8.64">entire global trade system apart and</text>
  <text start="231.23" dur="9.27">replacing it with a brand new trade</text>
  <text start="235.74" dur="8.34">system and guess what they don&amp;#39;t like it</text>
  <text start="240.5" dur="5.86">the media pundits the central bank the</text>
  <text start="244.08" dur="6.48">financial puns they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="246.36" dur="6.99">realize that Trump is struck</text>
  <text start="250.56" dur="7.19">structurally resetting the entire</text>
  <text start="253.35" dur="7.47">landscape of us-china trade</text>
  <text start="257.75" dur="7.03">relationships and trade relationships</text>
  <text start="260.82" dur="5.46">with other countries now this is coming</text>
  <text start="264.78" dur="4.23">out of the conservative tree house we</text>
  <text start="266.28" dur="5.64">read this before what Trump has done and</text>
  <text start="269.01" dur="5.58">he quietly has done this he went around</text>
  <text start="271.92" dur="5.37">to all the different countries South</text>
  <text start="274.59" dur="6.21">Korea Vietnam Philippines Japan and</text>
  <text start="277.29" dur="6.72">India and others and he met face to face</text>
  <text start="280.8" dur="8.12">with all these leaders he met eBay he</text>
  <text start="284.01" dur="9.03">met moon jae-in in South Korea he met</text>
  <text start="288.92" dur="7.66">President duarte in Philippines and they</text>
  <text start="293.04" dur="3.879">struck a deal and this was his November</text>
  <text start="296.58" dur="3.399">20</text>
  <text start="296.919" dur="5.641">17 tour of Asia and he met directly</text>
  <text start="299.979" dur="5.52">face-to-face one-on-one with the</text>
  <text start="302.56" dur="7.71">manufacturing heavyweights of Southeast</text>
  <text start="305.499" dur="7.17">Asia he set up trade deals with all of</text>
  <text start="310.27" dur="4.56">these countries because he knew that he</text>
  <text start="312.669" dur="5.28">was gonna be going after China he had to</text>
  <text start="314.83" dur="7.739">undo everything that was put into place</text>
  <text start="317.949" dur="9">to have China be the manufacturing China</text>
  <text start="322.569" dur="6.801">to be the power when the entire system</text>
  <text start="326.949" dur="5.701">imploded and everything was moved over</text>
  <text start="329.37" dur="7.24">he needed to undo this but before he did</text>
  <text start="332.65" dur="5.94">this he needed to make sure that once he</text>
  <text start="336.61" dur="4.23">placed tariffs on China and China</text>
  <text start="338.59" dur="7.53">retaliated he needed to make sure that</text>
  <text start="340.84" dur="8.669">he had other trading options and this is</text>
  <text start="346.12" dur="6.409">why he did the Asian tour first before</text>
  <text start="349.509" dur="7.38">he went and before he went after China</text>
  <text start="352.529" dur="6.22">so China they&amp;#39;re going to try to hold</text>
  <text start="356.889" dur="4.411">out as long as possible I do believe</text>
  <text start="358.749" dur="4.44">that GE and Trump still have some type</text>
  <text start="361.3" dur="4.679">of deal in mind that they&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="363.189" dur="6.66">made but they&amp;#39;re holding back right now</text>
  <text start="365.979" dur="6.511">and again this is all in preparation to</text>
  <text start="369.849" dur="5.79">get rid of the central bank system but</text>
  <text start="372.49" dur="6.269">Trump he understands that the United</text>
  <text start="375.639" dur="6">States needs to have new trade deals</text>
  <text start="378.759" dur="7.051">because once we come off the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="381.639" dur="7.65">system their countries no longer are</text>
  <text start="385.81" dur="6.99">going to keep the Federal Reserve Note</text>
  <text start="389.289" dur="6.331">as a reserve currency because they used</text>
  <text start="392.8" dur="5.549">to trade those for our goods once that</text>
  <text start="395.62" dur="6.18">is gone we&amp;#39;re gonna actually have to</text>
  <text start="398.349" dur="6">manufacture we&amp;#39;re actually gonna have to</text>
  <text start="401.8" dur="6.269">have trade deals that benefit the United</text>
  <text start="404.349" dur="6.57">States and this is exactly what Trump is</text>
  <text start="408.069" dur="5.58">doing right now Trump knows the strength</text>
  <text start="410.919" dur="5.78">of our US position is that our economy</text>
  <text start="413.649" dur="5.971">is deep and wide the u.s. is a</text>
  <text start="416.699" dur="4.12">self-sustaining economy almost 80% of</text>
  <text start="419.62" dur="3.96">our international production and</text>
  <text start="420.819" dur="6.45">manufacturing is purchased within our</text>
  <text start="423.58" dur="5.85">own market and the big picture economic</text>
  <text start="427.269" dur="3.581">strength is an outcome of the ability of</text>
  <text start="429.43" dur="3.84">a nation any nation</text>
  <text start="430.85" dur="4.89">to support itself first and foremost if</text>
  <text start="433.27" dur="4.84">nation&amp;#39;s economy is dependent on other</text>
  <text start="435.74" dur="4.56">nations to survive it is less strong</text>
  <text start="438.11" dur="5.42">than a nation whose economy is more</text>
  <text start="440.3" dur="5.24">independent now President Trump is</text>
  <text start="443.53" dur="4.93">executing one of the most brilliant</text>
  <text start="445.54" dur="6.97">geopolitical economic resets in the</text>
  <text start="448.46" dur="7.62">history of global trade and when you</text>
  <text start="452.51" dur="8.07">watch this it&amp;#39;s unbelievable what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="456.08" dur="5.94">doing and the reset phase has begun and</text>
  <text start="460.58" dur="4.41">I&amp;#39;m talking about the reset phase of</text>
  <text start="462.02" dur="5.16">trade because he needs to cement this</text>
  <text start="464.99" dur="5.22">first before he moves on</text>
  <text start="467.18" dur="4.62">now it&amp;#39;s fascinating that the financial</text>
  <text start="470.21" dur="4.02">pundants the mainstream media the</text>
  <text start="471.8" dur="4.2">central bank they didn&amp;#39;t see any of this</text>
  <text start="474.23" dur="5.67">coming remember Trump is a businessman</text>
  <text start="476" dur="6.3">he&amp;#39;s not a politician he understands the</text>
  <text start="479.9" dur="6">bottom dollar he understands how to get</text>
  <text start="482.3" dur="5.88">things done remember going presidents</text>
  <text start="485.9" dur="4.23">before him they were politicians they</text>
  <text start="488.18" dur="3.36">never wanted to get anything done they</text>
  <text start="490.13" dur="3.9">just made a lot of promises they never</text>
  <text start="491.54" dur="4.95">kept any promises and one of the best</text>
  <text start="494.03" dur="5.97">indicators of where things are going is</text>
  <text start="496.49" dur="5.73">the quote from the South China Post the</text>
  <text start="500" dur="4.53">administration&amp;#39;s section 301 tariffs and</text>
  <text start="502.22" dur="5.52">China retaliatory tariffs will now</text>
  <text start="504.53" dur="5.97">further disrupt or even break many</text>
  <text start="507.74" dur="7.23">thousands of supply chains in both</text>
  <text start="510.5" dur="8.91">countries this is exactly what he wants</text>
  <text start="514.97" dur="8.61">to do he wants to break the system it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="519.41" dur="6.96">being done on purpose he needs to do</text>
  <text start="523.58" dur="6.36">this and re-establish new trade deals</text>
  <text start="526.37" dur="8.37">new supply routes this is all being done</text>
  <text start="529.94" dur="8.79">as part of the plan and this quote by</text>
  <text start="534.74" dur="6.33">Nelson dung is stated as if shifting</text>
  <text start="538.73" dur="5.49">breaking supply chains is a flaw in the</text>
  <text start="541.07" dur="5.88">approach it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s actually it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.22" dur="6.03">actually the opposite this is a feature</text>
  <text start="546.95" dur="6.84">of the strategic reset a specific and</text>
  <text start="550.25" dur="6.57">purposeful feature designed by Trump now</text>
