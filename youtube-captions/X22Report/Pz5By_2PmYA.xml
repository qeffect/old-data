  <text start="247.65" dur="6.75">this all this austerity was a complete</text>
  <text start="251.22" dur="7.05">cover story for conducting class war</text>
  <text start="254.4" dur="5.97">against the poor and an economics</text>
  <text start="258.27" dur="4.56">professor who served on the Greece&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="260.37" dur="4.2">finance minister also said the same</text>
  <text start="262.83" dur="6.99">exact thing yes this is what we are</text>

  <text start="306.63" dur="7.14">down bringing in more wealth to the</text>
  <text start="309.84" dur="6.78">wealthy because they realize that this</text>
  <text start="313.77" dur="5.4">whole system can&amp;#39;t be maintained the way</text>
  <text start="316.62" dur="3.93">it is so they might as well get as much</text>

  <text start="409.68" dur="7.59">signal alerting that at least for now</text>
  <text start="412.47" dur="7.29">the bull market is completely over for</text>
  <text start="417.27" dur="5.67">now we are still in the classic crash</text>
  <text start="419.76" dur="6.48">season and that season lasts from</text>
  <text start="422.94" dur="5.55">mid-august to mid-october during this</text>
  <text start="426.24" dur="5.19">time the markets are most likely to make</text>
  <text start="428.49" dur="3.78">large movements down we&amp;#39;ve seen it in</text>
  <text start="431.43" dur="2.64">1973</text>
  <text start="432.27" dur="3.33">nineteen seventy-four nineteen eighty to</text>

  <text start="435.6" dur="4.23">two thousand one to two thousand to two</text>
  <text start="437.85" dur="4.5">thousand eight and two thousand eleven</text>
  <text start="439.83" dur="6.18">and here we are right now we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="442.35" dur="7.98">the same exact thing occur and we know</text>
  <text start="446.01" dur="8.94">that eventually this system that we are</text>
  <text start="450.33" dur="10.23">in today is not going to go much further</text>
  <text start="454.95" dur="7.47">we are seeing similar or almost exactly</text>
  <text start="460.56" dur="4.08">the same things that we saw back in two</text>
  <text start="462.42" dur="5.4">thousand eight but this time it is much</text>
  <text start="464.64" dur="6.84">much worse remember back then people had</text>
  <text start="467.82" dur="5.58">jobs people owned homes they&amp;#39;re able to</text>
  <text start="471.48" dur="4.86">refinance their home take some equity</text>
  <text start="473.4" dur="6.12">out of it well the American people we</text>
  <text start="476.34" dur="4.53">know they don&amp;#39;t own the homes we know</text>
  <text start="479.52" dur="6.42">that people don&amp;#39;t have those full-time</text>
  <text start="480.87" dur="8.37">jobs we know that these numbers of</text>
  <text start="485.94" dur="5.31">unemployment GDP housing retail are all</text>
  <text start="489.24" dur="3.54">completely fake and phony a lot of</text>
  <text start="491.25" dur="3.23">people lost their credit a lot of people</text>
  <text start="492.78" dur="5.76">lost their wealth saving their wealth</text>
  <text start="494.48" dur="6.37">their retirement funds so when this hits</text>
  <text start="498.54" dur="5.04">this time it&amp;#39;s going to be much much</text>
  <text start="500.85" dur="5.76">worse now we know the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="503.58" dur="5.46">continually pushing their agenda because</text>
  <text start="506.61" dur="3.99">they do believe when this comes crashing</text>
  <text start="509.04" dur="2.97">down and they blame it on some other</text>
  <text start="510.6" dur="2.82">country or group they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="512.01" dur="3.69">restart the whole thing and they wanted</text>
  <text start="513.42" dur="5.37">the way they want it and that is</text>
  <text start="515.7" dur="7.65">complete control of the people and they</text>
  <text start="518.79" dur="6.09">keep pushing Common Core out to everyone</text>
  <text start="523.35" dur="3.3">in the United States but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="524.88" dur="5.07">interesting about this the edge of the</text>
  <text start="526.65" dur="5.25">Education Secretary Arne Duncan first of</text>
  <text start="529.95" dur="6.18">all he&amp;#39;s not even educator he&amp;#39;s he</text>
  <text start="531.9" dur="5.97">majored in sociology and he went to a</text>
  <text start="536.13" dur="4.68">private school called University of</text>

  <text start="540.81" dur="8.22">school is from pre-k all the way up to</text>
  <text start="542.88" dur="8.82">12 grade and his children are going to</text>
  <text start="549.03" dur="4.68">attend this school actually Obama&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="553.71" dur="5.67">attended the school Rahm Emanuel his</text>
  <text start="557.22" dur="4.38">children attended the school and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="559.38" dur="5.09">so interesting about this school is that</text>
  <text start="561.6" dur="4.5">first of all is expensive second of all</text>
  <text start="564.47" dur="4.359">their whole thing</text>
  <text start="566.1" dur="7.02">about nurture and enduring spirit of</text>
  <text start="568.829" dur="10.141">scholarship curiosity creativity and the</text>
  <text start="573.12" dur="8.699">one thing they don&amp;#39;t abide by is what</text>
  <text start="578.97" dur="6.809">the public schools are doing today it</text>
  <text start="581.819" dur="9.351">does not follow the key school reform</text>
  <text start="585.779" dur="9.24">policies that the Education Department</text>
  <text start="591.17" dur="6.55">you know Arne Duncan&amp;#39;s department who</text>
  <text start="595.019" dur="4.171">created common core who says that</text>
  <text start="597.72" dur="4.71">everyone should be using it these are</text>
  <text start="599.19" dur="5.67">the new standards but guess what they</text>
  <text start="602.43" dur="5.61">don&amp;#39;t use it in this private school now</text>
  <text start="604.86" dur="6.419">here we are once again with our leader</text>
  <text start="608.04" dur="5.34">saying this is good for you but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="611.279" dur="5.011">not going to use it they did this was</text>
  <text start="613.38" dur="5.61">Obamacare all the government employees</text>
  <text start="616.29" dur="4.38">the president said Obamacare is great</text>
  <text start="618.99" dur="4.5">everyone should have it and then they</text>
  <text start="620.67" dur="6.12">exempted themselves here common core and</text>
  <text start="623.49" dur="6.18">this is the head of the who&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="626.79" dur="5.25">education secretary saying yes these are</text>
  <text start="629.67" dur="5.039">the standards you should be happy with</text>
  <text start="632.04" dur="4.409">them they&amp;#39;re much better they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="634.709" dur="3.721">to make your children smarter which we</text>
  <text start="636.449" dur="4.44">know this is completely fake phony and</text>
  <text start="638.43" dur="3.959">false and everyone should be happy with</text>
  <text start="640.889" dur="4.26">it and then they go off and they send</text>
  <text start="642.389" dur="5.43">their children to a private school that</text>
  <text start="645.149" dur="4.68">doesn&amp;#39;t adhere to these standards</text>
  <text start="647.819" dur="4.801">whatsoever they&amp;#39;re on different</text>
  <text start="649.829" dur="4.88">standards because they probably looked</text>
  <text start="652.62" dur="6.569">at him and said we&amp;#39;re not doing this and</text>
  <text start="654.709" dur="6.31">we see this time and time again not just</text>
  <text start="659.189" dur="5.161">with this but with the First Amendment</text>
  <text start="661.019" dur="5.581">with the Second Amendment they always</text>

  <text start="666.6" dur="8.12">for them it&amp;#39;s always different now we</text>
  <text start="671.639" dur="8.19">understand that the u.s. government</text>
  <text start="674.72" dur="10.539">wants to control the internet and we see</text>

  <text start="765.31" dur="6.21">solution is to censor everything and</text>
  <text start="767.98" dur="5.94">license the speech so there are</text>
  <text start="771.52" dur="6.56">parameters in the license that you</text>
  <text start="773.92" dur="7.95">receive just like hmm the television</text>
  <text start="778.08" dur="6.97">again they&amp;#39;re under control of an agency</text>
  <text start="781.87" dur="4.92">and they&amp;#39;re allowed to say certain words</text>
  <text start="785.05" dur="5.85">they can&amp;#39;t say certain things they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="786.79" dur="9.9">show whatever they want to show so</text>
  <text start="790.9" dur="7.71">political and governmental bodies need</text>
  <text start="796.69" dur="4.59">to use their licensing prerogative and</text>
  <text start="798.61" dur="5.63">only grant licenses to those telecoms</text>
  <text start="801.28" dur="10.74">and search engines that supervised</text>
  <text start="804.24" dur="11.349">content and its dissemination so what</text>
  <text start="812.02" dur="6.3">are we seeing here we are seeing that</text>
  <text start="815.589" dur="6.061">they&amp;#39;re going to control and censor the</text>
  <text start="818.32" dur="9.69">internet this has been their plan for a</text>
  <text start="821.65" dur="8.58">long time and why are they doing this</text>
  <text start="828.01" dur="5.519">because right now the internet is</text>
  <text start="830.23" dur="6.209">completely open it&amp;#39;s like the Wild West</text>
  <text start="833.529" dur="5.1">and they don&amp;#39;t like that people can go</text>
  <text start="836.439" dur="4.5">on their show different videos</text>
  <text start="838.629" dur="5.46">photographs and talk about anything</text>
  <text start="840.939" dur="5.94">especially things that don&amp;#39;t match up to</text>
  <text start="844.089" dur="3.99">the government propaganda and this is</text>
  <text start="846.879" dur="4.77">why they want to control everything at</text>
  <text start="848.079" dur="5.461">this point now out in Ukraine we</text>
  <text start="851.649" dur="4.401">understand that they are imposing</text>
  <text start="853.54" dur="6.419">sanctions on Russia they pretty much</text>
  <text start="856.05" dur="6.009">decided that two airlines cannot fly</text>
  <text start="859.959" dur="4.29">over the Ukraine and Russia right now is</text>
  <text start="862.059" dur="3.9">going to retaliate against these type of</text>
  <text start="864.249" dur="3.301">sanctions what they&amp;#39;re going to do we</text>
  <text start="865.959" dur="5">don&amp;#39;t know yet but they said something</text>
  <text start="867.55" dur="6.599">is coming because this is ridiculous and</text>
  <text start="870.959" dur="5.201">uncalled for at this time Russia Iran</text>
  <text start="874.149" dur="4.29">Iraq and Syria they&amp;#39;ve agreed to</text>
  <text start="876.16" dur="5.549">establish a joint information center in</text>
  <text start="878.439" dur="5.491">Baghdad to coordinate their operations</text>
  <text start="881.709" dur="5.57">against the Islamic state that&amp;#39;s right a</text>
  <text start="883.93" dur="5.49">coalition to go after the terrorists</text>
  <text start="887.279" dur="4.05">completely different and separate than</text>
  <text start="889.42" dur="6.06">the United States and that coalition</text>
  <text start="891.329" dur="6.041">this is going to pose a problem so the</text>
  <text start="895.48" dur="4.409">main goal of this Center will be</text>
  <text start="897.37" dur="5.1">gathering processing and analyzing all</text>
  <text start="899.889" dur="5.43">the information about the situation in</text>
  <text start="902.47" dur="5.76">the Middle East and we know what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="905.319" dur="6.931">to happen they&amp;#39;re picking up all the</text>
  <text start="908.23" dur="6.419">Intel finding out where all the all the</text>
  <text start="912.25" dur="4.17">troops are for the proxy army which is</text>
  <text start="914.649" dur="2.79">the Islamic state which is created by</text>
  <text start="916.42" dur="3.69">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="917.439" dur="4.5">bankers and they will eliminate them and</text>
  <text start="920.11" dur="3.63">once they eliminate them there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="921.939" dur="6.301">reason for the United States to be in</text>
  <text start="923.74" dur="7.38">the country right now Assad is using the</text>
  <text start="928.24" dur="5.13">Russian Jets they launched airstrikes</text>
  <text start="931.12" dur="6.209">above Aleppo&amp;#39;s eastern country side</text>
  <text start="933.37" dur="7.73">hitting specifically the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="937.329" dur="7.291">and nobody else no infrastructure and</text>
  <text start="941.1" dur="5.079">they&amp;#39;re hitting them hard now it would</text>
  <text start="944.62" dur="3.809">look kind of suspicious of all of a</text>
  <text start="946.179" dur="6.061">sudden the Islamic state received you</text>
  <text start="948.429" dur="5.491">know ground-to-air missiles that would</text>
  <text start="952.24" dur="3.75">be kind of strange where do they get</text>
  <text start="953.92" dur="4.169">them all of a sudden but I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="955.99" dur="6.659">surprised of all of a sudden they come</text>
  <text start="958.089" dur="7.92">by them we see that the u.s. train</text>
  <text start="962.649" dur="4.181">Syrian rebels just hand it over trucks</text>
  <text start="966.009" dur="4.211">ammo</text>
  <text start="966.83" dur="5.73">to al-qaeda now CENTCOM denied this</text>
  <text start="970.22" dur="4.74">report sigh no no it didn&amp;#39;t happen but</text>
  <text start="972.56" dur="3.87">then they came out and said yes this</text>
  <text start="974.96" dur="5.46">might have happened they might have</text>
  <text start="976.43" dur="5.37">handed over all this equipment well</text>
  <text start="980.42" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;ve been doing this for a very long</text>
  <text start="981.8" dur="4.62">time they&amp;#39;ve been handing over all of</text>
  <text start="984.02" dur="5.61">this equipment because as we know the</text>
  <text start="986.42" dur="5.76">Train Free Syrian Army is really the</text>
  <text start="989.63" dur="3.99">Islamic state al Qaeda and whatever</text>
  <text start="992.18" dur="3.75">other terrorist organization you want to</text>
  <text start="993.62" dur="5.67">throw in there because the whole purpose</text>
  <text start="995.93" dur="6.39">of this is to create confusion to have</text>
  <text start="999.29" dur="5.94">the proxy armies to go after Assad this</text>
  <text start="1002.32" dur="5.73">is the main goal at this point and Putin</text>
  <text start="1005.23" dur="5.19">now is pushing back the United States is</text>
  <text start="1008.05" dur="3.51">looking at Russia of course just saying</text>

  <text start="1011.56" dur="5.52">Russian aggression and pretty soon this</text>
  <text start="1015.7" dur="4.17">whole thing is going to come to a head</text>

  <text start="1019.87" dur="5.07">is the big question will this be the</text>
  <text start="1022.18" dur="6.6">start of World War three will the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1024.94" dur="6.98">back down they might back down at this</text>
  <text start="1028.78" dur="5.809">point but as we know they never give up</text>
  <text start="1031.92" dur="6.279">because once the Islamic state is</text>

  <text start="1038.199" dur="7.081">Russia of Syria of a rack of Iran is to</text>
  <text start="1043.12" dur="4.829">get rid of the Islamic state the goal of</text>
