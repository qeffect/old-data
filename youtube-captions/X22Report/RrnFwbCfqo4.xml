  <text start="1558.67" dur="3.51">want this confusion at this point</text>
  <text start="1560.47" dur="3.99">because eventually what they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1562.18" dur="5.4">do is they&amp;#39;re most likely going to use</text>
  <text start="1564.46" dur="4.95">this to create some type of an event</text>
  <text start="1567.58" dur="4.35">because the government officials just</text>
  <text start="1569.41" dur="4.26">won&amp;#39;t let us forget that the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1571.93" dur="3.84">state is very very dangerous and they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1579.16" dur="4.56">like sista but it&amp;#39;s pretty much the same</text>
  <text start="1581.92" dur="3.83">thing but Dianne Feinstein created it</text>
  <text start="1583.72" dur="5.7">and you know it allows companies to</text>
  <text start="1585.75" dur="6.64">share information personal information</text>
  <text start="1589.42" dur="5.58">voluntarily without being subject to any</text>
  <text start="1592.39" dur="6.02">type of lawsuit or liability but here</text>
  <text start="1595" dur="6.33">are a couple things that sissa or sista</text>
  <text start="1598.41" dur="4.6">what the US government needs to see your</text>
  <text start="1601.33" dur="4.08">data what they need right now to see</text>
  <text start="1603.01" dur="3.93">your data is this they need to suspect</text>
  <text start="1605.41" dur="4.2">you have a crime they need to get a</text>
  <text start="1606.94" dur="5.19">warrant they need they need to request</text>
  <text start="1609.61" dur="7.08">data from each company separately</text>
  <text start="1612.13" dur="8.7">once sissa or specific passes they need</text>
  <text start="1616.69" dur="7.16">absolutely nothing nothing US government</text>
  <text start="1620.83" dur="7.14">agencies can spy on you which ones well</text>
  <text start="1623.85" dur="10.24">NSA but they do it illegally if sissa or</text>
  <text start="1627.97" dur="9">sista passes IRS FBI FEMA NSA Interpol</text>
  <text start="1634.09" dur="5.06">US Army veterans affair Homeland</text>
  <text start="1636.97" dur="5.7">Security used US Postal Service</text>
  <text start="1639.15" dur="5.92">immigration pretty much everybody what</text>
  <text start="1642.67" dur="5.07">law enforcement needs to spy on you well</text>
  <text start="1645.07" dur="5.01">what right now they need a warrant they</text>
  <text start="1647.74" dur="6.41">need a subpoena they need a national</text>
  <text start="1650.08" dur="7.77">security letter if cissa or sis bypasses</text>
  <text start="1654.15" dur="6.73">nothing they don&amp;#39;t need anything I mean</text>
  <text start="1657.85" dur="5.7">you could see how damaging this really</text>
  <text start="1660.88" dur="5.1">is it&amp;#39;s pretty much removing everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1663.55" dur="6">rights places online where you can</text>
  <text start="1665.98" dur="8.55">expect privacy currently its Facebook</text>
  <text start="1669.55" dur="7.32">Google Yahoo amazon kind of private NSA</text>
  <text start="1674.53" dur="5.28">still has backdoors into these companies</text>
  <text start="1676.87" dur="5.1">but in the most part many of the other</text>
  <text start="1679.81" dur="5.51">government agencies can&amp;#39;t access it if</text>
  <text start="1681.97" dur="5.58">sis but anticipa-- passes guess what</text>
  <text start="1685.32" dur="3.58">your information is not private anymore</text>
  <text start="1687.55" dur="3.93">because they can hand it over to the</text>
  <text start="1688.9" dur="5.37">government so there is no privacy</text>
  <text start="1691.48" dur="9.98">whatsoever and we can see why this is so</text>
  <text start="1694.27" dur="10.68">so dangerous okay now we understand that</text>
  <text start="1701.46" dur="5.53">Syria has pretty much gotten rid of all</text>
  <text start="1704.95" dur="4.2">its chemical weapons and it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="1706.99" dur="4.35">brought out into the ocean and destroyed</text>

  <text start="1724.99" dur="4.86">sitting there waiting to be destroyed</text>
  <text start="1727.15" dur="5.91">and who knows we might see some type of</text>
  <text start="1729.85" dur="6.54">incident where they say these terrorists</text>
  <text start="1733.06" dur="5.43">attacked the area stole the chemicals</text>
  <text start="1736.39" dur="4.05">and now we&amp;#39;re running around the country</text>
  <text start="1738.49" dur="3.9">in lone wolf groups and we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1740.44" dur="4.08">where they are but it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="1742.39" dur="3.45">that the chemicals are in Texas we had</text>
  <text start="1744.52" dur="5.13">the crisis actors</text>
  <text start="1745.84" dur="6.54">being advertised for Texas and pretty</text>
