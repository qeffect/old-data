  <text start="113.51" dur="7.08">time this is coming from a report from</text>
  <text start="117.05" dur="5.879">the Executive Council and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="120.59" dur="4.74">looking to do and what is happening here</text>
  <text start="122.929" dur="6.181">is that as this country continually</text>
  <text start="125.33" dur="6.47">takes on more debt well there&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="129.11" dur="5.97">enough revenue to support the debt and</text>

  <text start="142.819" dur="4.681">Greece is going to be in a huge amount</text>
  <text start="145.31" dur="4.8">of trouble now they&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="147.5" dur="6.51">next elections they&amp;#39;re looking at more</text>
  <text start="150.11" dur="6.69">austerity and everything these countries</text>
  <text start="154.01" dur="4.5">are doing should be the opposite of what</text>
  <text start="156.8" dur="4.019">the central banks want they should write</text>
  <text start="158.51" dur="4.83">off the debt saying listen we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="160.819" dur="4.561">not going to pay you and they should put</text>
  <text start="163.34" dur="5.07">people back to work they should get out</text>

  <text start="168.41" dur="4.53">own currency they should create their</text>
  <text start="170.69" dur="3.629">own currency without interest because</text>
  <text start="172.94" dur="4.019">remember every time they give them a</text>
  <text start="174.319" dur="6.541">trench there&amp;#39;s interest attached to this</text>
  <text start="176.959" dur="7.831">this is a no-win situation and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="180.86" dur="5.25">just Greece it&amp;#39;s the entire world and</text>
  <text start="184.79" dur="4.35">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="186.11" dur="6.45">is a complete breakdown of the system</text>
  <text start="189.14" dur="5.85">and it&amp;#39;s not just with these countries</text>
  <text start="192.56" dur="4.37">it&amp;#39;s with corporations remember a lot of</text>
  <text start="194.99" dur="3.09">these corporations around the world and</text>
  <text start="196.93" dur="3.52">banks</text>
  <text start="198.08" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating fudging their</text>
  <text start="200.45" dur="4.11">information and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="203" dur="4.65">that a lot of corporations are coming</text>
  <text start="204.56" dur="5.55">out saying listen revenues they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="207.65" dur="5.64">not their sales they&amp;#39;re just not there</text>
  <text start="210.11" dur="6.2">and our companies are doing much worse</text>
  <text start="213.29" dur="7.669">than we were in the last couple of years</text>
  <text start="216.31" dur="6.97">because this fake illusion is now dying</text>
  <text start="220.959" dur="4.991">harley-davidson right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="223.28" dur="5.58">announcing layoffs and they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="225.95" dur="6.33">to close some factories and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="228.86" dur="5.79">seeing right now is that sales are down</text>
  <text start="232.28" dur="4.05">by nine point three percent in the</text>
  <text start="234.65" dur="4.92">second quarter compared to a year ago</text>
  <text start="236.33" dur="6.69">and they have a couple of reasons why</text>
  <text start="239.57" dur="5.61">this is happening right now and their</text>
  <text start="243.02" dur="4.469">reasons are is that more of its</text>
  <text start="245.18" dur="5.059">customers are getting financially</text>
  <text start="247.489" dur="6.681">distressed they&amp;#39;re seeing rising</text>
  <text start="250.239" dur="7.78">delinquencies losses on its loan book</text>
  <text start="254.17" dur="6.039">yes this is what is happening as more</text>
  <text start="258.019" dur="4.231">and more people lose their job they</text>
  <text start="260.209" dur="4.02">can&amp;#39;t pay for their motorcycle they</text>
  <text start="262.25" dur="3.72">can&amp;#39;t pay for their car they can&amp;#39;t pay</text>
  <text start="264.229" dur="3.75">for the electricity they can&amp;#39;t pay for</text>
  <text start="265.97" dur="5.93">their home they can&amp;#39;t pay for these</text>
  <text start="267.979" dur="7.44">things they&amp;#39;re also saying that the a</text>
  <text start="271.9" dur="6.13">hot B ha the motorcycle is an iconic</text>
  <text start="275.419" dur="4.741">motorcycle for the baby boomers and the</text>
  <text start="278.03" dur="5.31">baby boomers are moving on right now yes</text>
  <text start="280.16" dur="5.85">this is true also the other thing</text>
  <text start="283.34" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re seeing is that motorcycle sales</text>
  <text start="286.01" dur="6.68">in the US have been a nightmare since</text>
  <text start="288.71" dur="8.31">the peak in 2005 and when we hit that</text>
  <text start="292.69" dur="8.62">recession in 2008 sales plunged and they</text>
  <text start="297.02" dur="7.62">never really recovered sales have always</text>
  <text start="301.31" dur="6.3">been down since that time and they could</text>
  <text start="304.64" dur="4.8">never boost it back up and now it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="307.61" dur="6.27">sliding and getting worse and worse</text>
  <text start="309.44" dur="7.2">actually sales at dealers globally they</text>
  <text start="313.88" dur="5.039">fell by 6.7% and they&amp;#39;re saying looking</text>
  <text start="316.64" dur="3.32">forward it&amp;#39;s not going to get any better</text>
  <text start="318.919" dur="5.12">it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="319.96" dur="6.929">to get worse and the fourth problem that</text>
  <text start="324.039" dur="4.591">they have here is that the prices of</text>
  <text start="326.889" dur="5.4">these motorcycles they&amp;#39;re too expensive</text>
  <text start="328.63" dur="6.86">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is as</text>
  <text start="332.289" dur="5.31">the the dollar continually devalues</text>
  <text start="335.49" dur="3.64">products are going to become more and</text>
  <text start="337.599" dur="3.271">more expensive and this is what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="339.13" dur="3.75">been seeing over time why do you think</text>
  <text start="340.87" dur="4.35">when you go to purchase car used to be</text>
  <text start="342.88" dur="4.439">able to buy a car in cash and then they</text>
  <text start="345.22" dur="3.87">went to financing you could finance it</text>
  <text start="347.319" dur="4.171">for three years then they had to go to</text>
  <text start="349.09" dur="5.16">five years then they had to go to seven</text>
  <text start="351.49" dur="4.98">years then they had to create leasing</text>
  <text start="354.25" dur="4.41">because the financing was just way too</text>
  <text start="356.47" dur="4.5">expensive to get people in and to</text>
  <text start="358.66" dur="3.629">purchase cars so they had to go to</text>
  <text start="360.97" dur="3.449">leasing which means you&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="362.289" dur="4.47">renting it you&amp;#39;re only when you get for</text>
  <text start="364.419" dur="4.59">a certain period of time and now that</text>
  <text start="366.759" dur="3.421">even becoming too expensive and of</text>
  <text start="369.009" dur="3.09">course then they had to bring it down to</text>
  <text start="370.18" dur="4.079">the subprime level just to get anyone in</text>
  <text start="372.099" dur="4.471">there to purchase these automobiles and</text>
  <text start="374.259" dur="5.521">the reason for this and this is why they</text>
  <text start="376.57" dur="5.73">had to do all these tricky finance type</text>
  <text start="379.78" dur="5.91">of maneuvers is because the value of the</text>
  <text start="382.3" dur="3.89">dollar continually decreases IBM right</text>
  <text start="385.69" dur="5.31">now</text>
  <text start="386.19" dur="7.81">well IBM is reporting the 21st</text>
  <text start="391" dur="8.18">consecutive quarter of declining sales</text>
  <text start="394" dur="8.219">now remember IBM is a master at</text>
  <text start="399.18" dur="4.56">manipulation fudging their books now</text>
  <text start="402.219" dur="5.911">last quarter</text>
  <text start="403.74" dur="6.94">IBM well they manipulated their books</text>
  <text start="408.13" dur="5.279">and they were showing the world that</text>
  <text start="410.68" dur="6.69">look they beat expectations well they</text>
  <text start="413.409" dur="8.82">used the lowest effective non-gaap tax</text>
  <text start="417.37" dur="8.25">rate to pull this off and we can see at</text>
  <text start="422.229" dur="6.301">this time that at this rate IBM will</text>
  <text start="425.62" dur="5.13">soon need to go negative non-gaap tax</text>
  <text start="428.53" dur="5.79">rate to make its negative non-gaap</text>
  <text start="430.75" dur="5.909">earnings turn positive what is happening</text>
  <text start="434.32" dur="3.899">here is they&amp;#39;re bringing down their tax</text>
  <text start="436.659" dur="4.651">rate and they&amp;#39;re getting to the point</text>
  <text start="438.219" dur="5.19">where there is no other place to go and</text>
  <text start="441.31" dur="5.039">we&amp;#39;ve seen this before in other</text>
  <text start="443.409" dur="6.51">corporations we&amp;#39;ve seen that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="446.349" dur="5.281">used these tricky accounting methods to</text>
  <text start="449.919" dur="3.391">make the companies look like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="451.63" dur="2.28">doing a lot better than they really are</text>
  <text start="453.31" dur="1.74">and</text>
  <text start="453.91" dur="2.7">a lot of times what they do is they</text>
  <text start="455.05" dur="3.81">closed a lot of factories lay off people</text>
  <text start="456.61" dur="3.9">they buy back their stock they use this</text>
  <text start="458.86" dur="4.53">tricky accounting method and they say</text>
  <text start="460.51" dur="5.04">everything is fine until a couple months</text>
  <text start="463.39" dur="4.25">later or maybe even a year later we find</text>
  <text start="465.55" dur="4.68">out that things are absolutely horrific</text>
  <text start="467.64" dur="5.17">we&amp;#39;ve seen this with Enron and many</text>
  <text start="470.23" dur="3.63">other corporations we&amp;#39;re seeing the same</text>
  <text start="472.81" dur="2.76">thing right now because what is</text>
  <text start="473.86" dur="4.65">happening is we&amp;#39;re coming to the end</text>
  <text start="475.57" dur="7.08">game here where there&amp;#39;s nothing else for</text>
  <text start="478.51" dur="7.92">them to do the magic of this illusionary</text>
  <text start="482.65" dur="7.16">economy is coming to an end remember we</text>
  <text start="486.43" dur="7.71">talked about this before you cannot fake</text>
  <text start="489.81" dur="7.27">sales I mean you can fake the numbers</text>
  <text start="494.14" dur="4.32">but that&amp;#39;s very easy to spot and you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="497.08" dur="3.75">get caught in a second and those people</text>
  <text start="498.46" dur="4.74">faking that information will eventually</text>
  <text start="500.83" dur="5.88">go to jail so this is something very</text>
  <text start="503.2" dur="7.13">hard to fake and revenue is also very</text>
  <text start="506.71" dur="7.2">difficult to fake corporate tax receipts</text>
  <text start="510.33" dur="6.82">this is also very hard to fake and all</text>
  <text start="513.91" dur="7.319">of this has been declining across the</text>
  <text start="517.15" dur="7.86">board which shows us that this economy</text>
  <text start="521.229" dur="6.661">that we&amp;#39;re in well it&amp;#39;s fake and the</text>
  <text start="525.01" dur="5.34">true economy is now breaking through</text>
  <text start="527.89" dur="4.53">people are starting to realize something</text>
  <text start="530.35" dur="5.52">is terribly wrong here</text>
  <text start="532.42" dur="4.83">now in the housing market we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="535.87" dur="3.75">all this information and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="537.25" dur="4.17">wow housing starts are up permits</text>
  <text start="539.62" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;ve rebound but we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="541.42" dur="5.1">before and what happens is people apply</text>
  <text start="543.76" dur="5.49">for these permits then nothing really</text>
  <text start="546.52" dur="4.62">happens the housing starts yes people</text>
  <text start="549.25" dur="3.6">start their houses and then they cancel</text>
  <text start="551.14" dur="5.55">them this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing this</text>
  <text start="552.85" dur="6.09">up-and-down motion of permitir up</text>
  <text start="556.69" dur="4.44">housing starts are up and then the next</text>
  <text start="558.94" dur="4.2">month they decline as much as they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="561.13" dur="4.53">gone up or sometimes even more so and</text>
  <text start="563.14" dur="6.48">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now following</text>
  <text start="565.66" dur="6.36">three straight monthly declines housing</text>
  <text start="569.62" dur="4.68">starts miraculously rose by eight point</text>
  <text start="572.02" dur="4.47">three percent month a month in June now</text>
  <text start="574.3" dur="5.88">this is the biggest jump since December</text>
  <text start="576.49" dur="5.79">of 2016 and what we&amp;#39;re going to see most</text>
  <text start="580.18" dur="4.59">likely the next month is all those</text>
  <text start="582.28" dur="5.19">starts and all those permits guess what</text>
  <text start="584.77" dur="3.06">it&amp;#39;s going to decrease rapidly we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="587.47" dur="2.37">seen</text>
  <text start="587.83" dur="4.65">before and when we look at the graph we</text>
  <text start="589.84" dur="5.76">can see that every time they push it up</text>
  <text start="592.48" dur="6.27">we have the same coming down or even</text>
  <text start="595.6" dur="5.25">more than it went up so we see that</text>
  <text start="598.75" dur="4.65">there&amp;#39;s going to be major major problems</text>
  <text start="600.85" dur="6.53">now if we look if we look at quarter</text>
  <text start="603.4" dur="8.76">comparisons starts are really down 6%</text>
  <text start="607.38" dur="8.11">permits are down 3.4% so all of this</text>
  <text start="612.16" dur="5.97">talk of housing is rebounding now these</text>
  <text start="615.49" dur="6.99">are words they use to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="618.13" dur="6.51">that the economy is still a ok and what</text>
  <text start="622.48" dur="5.19">we&amp;#39;re really seeing is we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="624.64" dur="5.4">major breakdown in the entire economy I</text>
  <text start="627.67" dur="4.83">mean think about all the things I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="630.04" dur="4.47">talking about the true economy where the</text>

  <text start="670.72" dur="6.9">they&amp;#39;re starting to fall apart and this</text>
  <text start="675.19" dur="5.31">is going to accelerate actually it has</text>

  <text start="690.04" dur="6.38">into October of 2008 and it started in</text>
  <text start="693.31" dur="6.03">the summer of 2008 when corporations</text>
  <text start="696.42" dur="4.8">needed to be bailed out and more</text>

  <text start="706.03" dur="4.89">needed to be bailed out we&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="708.25" dur="6.48">we&amp;#39;re seeing the same exact thing happen</text>
  <text start="710.92" dur="6.81">once again now we&amp;#39;re seeing many many</text>
  <text start="714.73" dur="5.25">people and as this become more and more</text>
  <text start="717.73" dur="3.9">popular more and more people are</text>
  <text start="719.98" dur="3.029">flooding into cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="721.63" dur="3.209">now I know there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="723.009" dur="3.031">cryptocurrencies out there some like 700</text>
  <text start="724.839" dur="4.771">to 900 different cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="726.04" dur="6.029">they&amp;#39;re not all going to be around most</text>
  <text start="729.61" dur="5.49">of them are complete junk but there are</text>
  <text start="732.069" dur="7.32">a few that are going to be a benefit to</text>
  <text start="735.1" dur="7.799">the world economy and if we stick to the</text>
  <text start="739.389" dur="5.491">decentralized systems the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="742.899" dur="4.231">well they kind of oppose this because</text>
  <text start="744.88" dur="4.86">they will then have no control over it</text>
  <text start="747.13" dur="4.98">they won&amp;#39;t be able to use currency to</text>
  <text start="749.74" dur="3.899">sanction different countries they will</text>
  <text start="752.11" dur="3.45">not be able to use the currency to have</text>
  <text start="753.639" dur="4.5">regime change they will not be able to</text>
  <text start="755.56" dur="5.279">do anything because a decentralized</text>
  <text start="758.139" dur="5.19">cryptocurrency is a truth machine it</text>
  <text start="760.839" dur="4.62">keeps everyone US and corporations or</text>
  <text start="763.329" dur="5.93">financial institutions like JP Morgan</text>
  <text start="765.459" dur="6.421">Chase Bank of America Goldman Sachs</text>
  <text start="769.259" dur="4.181">guess what all this manipulation and all</text>
  <text start="771.88" dur="4.319">this insider trading and everything</text>
  <text start="773.44" dur="8.009">they&amp;#39;ve been doing this will come to an</text>
  <text start="776.199" dur="8.671">end now we need to move forward in going</text>
  <text start="781.449" dur="6.81">in this direction to make sure that the</text>
  <text start="784.87" dur="5.219">next system is separate and apart from</text>
  <text start="788.259" dur="3.18">any central banking system because we</text>
  <text start="790.089" dur="3.69">really don&amp;#39;t need the central banking</text>
  <text start="791.439" dur="5.371">system they don&amp;#39;t add any type of</text>
  <text start="793.779" dur="5.881">benefit to the everyday person the</text>
  <text start="796.81" dur="5.73">benefit is to those in government the</text>
  <text start="799.66" dur="5.369">benefit is to all the banks that again</text>
  <text start="802.54" dur="6.149">most of these banks sit on the board of</text>
  <text start="805.029" dur="4.92">the central bank the Fed and they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="808.689" dur="3.661">ones who manipulate everything so</text>
  <text start="809.949" dur="5.461">they&amp;#39;re always making tons and tons of</text>
  <text start="812.35" dur="5.609">money and if you notice this is what</text>
  <text start="815.41" dur="7.2">they&amp;#39;ve been doing year after year after</text>
  <text start="817.959" dur="8.341">year and at this point there is no</text>
  <text start="822.61" dur="6.12">reason for them to even exist the</text>
  <text start="826.3" dur="4.8">founding fathers knew this they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="828.73" dur="4.919">create the Constitution saying and also</text>
  <text start="831.1" dur="4.44">let&amp;#39;s make room for a central bank which</text>
  <text start="833.649" dur="4.56">is privately owned which will control</text>
  <text start="835.54" dur="7.26">the currency no they didn&amp;#39;t have that in</text>
  <text start="838.209" dur="6.771">there and we can see right now this is</text>
  <text start="842.8" dur="7.339">their biggest fear their biggest fear is</text>
  <text start="844.98" dur="8.409">to have the people control the currency</text>
  <text start="850.139" dur="4.291">now they are going to try to control it</text>
  <text start="853.389" dur="2.51">they are</text>
  <text start="854.43" dur="4.26">going to try to use though as we know</text>
  <text start="855.899" dur="4.651">Goldman Sachs has already filed a patent</text>
  <text start="858.69" dur="4.29">for their trading system because they</text>
  <text start="860.55" dur="3.87">want to be in control of the trading</text>
  <text start="862.98" dur="4.44">system we know there&amp;#39;s other</text>
  <text start="864.42" dur="5.28">cryptocurrencies that will be used as a</text>
  <text start="867.42" dur="4.14">trading system type of blockchain system</text>
  <text start="869.7" dur="4.05">which will be a truth machine because it</text>
  <text start="871.56" dur="4.23">keeps track of all the different</text>
  <text start="873.75" dur="4.649">transactions going all the way back to</text>
  <text start="875.79" dur="6.81">the beginning of time and we see right</text>
  <text start="878.399" dur="7.141">now that there are many countries that</text>
  <text start="882.6" dur="4.109">are looking to do this and I just want</text>
  <text start="885.54" dur="2.489">to be very clear about this I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="886.709" dur="3.361">talking about the private western</text>
  <text start="888.029" dur="4.321">central bank I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="890.07" dur="4.05">people of the country I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="892.35" dur="3.299">the government that is working for the</text>
  <text start="894.12" dur="4.409">people where they&amp;#39;re saying yes a</text>
  <text start="895.649" dur="6.091">decentralized system is the way to go</text>
  <text start="898.529" dur="7.051">and a decentralized system well it</text>
  <text start="901.74" dur="7.02">allows the people to be free of the</text>
  <text start="905.58" dur="6.33">central bank or a bank where they can</text>
  <text start="908.76" dur="5.19">freeze your account where they can say</text>
  <text start="911.91" dur="4.88">you know something you can&amp;#39;t withdraw</text>
  <text start="913.95" dur="6.6">you can&amp;#39;t do anything with your funds or</text>
  <text start="916.79" dur="8.08">it also allows you not to have balance</text>
  <text start="920.55" dur="8.7">of your currency so this does allow a</text>
  <text start="924.87" dur="6.06">lot of freedom for the people and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="929.25" dur="3.72">not that big of a stretch to go to</text>
  <text start="930.93" dur="4.56">cryptocurrency because we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="932.97" dur="5.6">using you know credit cards we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="935.49" dur="6.24">already using phones we&amp;#39;re already using</text>
  <text start="938.57" dur="6.61">electronic banking so we&amp;#39;re already in</text>
  <text start="941.73" dur="5.31">the electronic rina all we need to do is</text>
  <text start="945.18" dur="4.349">take it to the next step and the next</text>
  <text start="947.04" dur="4.739">step is to take control of it have a</text>
  <text start="949.529" dur="4.56">decentralized and make sure that the</text>
  <text start="951.779" dur="4.291">banks the central banks have nothing to</text>
  <text start="954.089" dur="5.071">do with it and eventually you won&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="956.07" dur="5.97">need a bank to keep your funds there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="959.16" dur="6.33">no reason for it and we could see that</text>
  <text start="962.04" dur="5.97">this is definitely a movement now once</text>
  <text start="965.49" dur="4.849">this happens and once we start breaking</text>
  <text start="968.01" dur="6.09">down the system through this transition</text>
  <text start="970.339" dur="6.611">well then gold and silver there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="974.1" dur="5.21">reason to manipulate it because once the</text>
  <text start="976.95" dur="5.79">dollar is no longer the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="979.31" dur="6.279">once people around the world are using</text>
  <text start="982.74" dur="5.13">some other type of currency there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="985.589" dur="2.711">absolutely no reason to manipulate gold</text>
  <text start="987.87" dur="2.71">and silver</text>
  <text start="988.3" dur="4.23">right now gold and silver is being</text>
  <text start="990.58" dur="5.04">manipulated by the central banking</text>
  <text start="992.53" dur="5.16">system and suppressing it all the time</text>
  <text start="995.62" dur="4.02">to make the dollar look better and they</text>
  <text start="997.69" dur="4.32">don&amp;#39;t want people piling into gold and</text>
  <text start="999.64" dur="4.26">silver but we can see that times are</text>
  <text start="1002.01" dur="5.61">changing and if you look at the crypto</text>
  <text start="1003.9" dur="5.97">market it does show you what gold and</text>
  <text start="1007.62" dur="4.62">silver should be doing right now they</text>
  <text start="1009.87" dur="4.35">should be moving up against the dollar</text>
  <text start="1012.24" dur="4.53">this is what&amp;#39;s happening to Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="1014.22" dur="4.83">because you see Bitcoin you know</text>
  <text start="1016.77" dur="4.92">dropping yes in value moving up in value</text>
  <text start="1019.05" dur="5.13">but we can see that one Bitcoin is</text>
  <text start="1021.69" dur="6.24">anywhere from 2,000 to 2,500 right now</text>
  <text start="1024.18" dur="7.02">and we see that it&amp;#39;s continually moving</text>
  <text start="1027.93" dur="5.79">up over time showing you that people are</text>
  <text start="1031.2" dur="5.22">saying you know something I need to</text>
  <text start="1033.72" dur="3.27">place my funds someplace where should I</text>
  <text start="1036.42" dur="2.79">put it</text>
  <text start="1036.99" dur="5.16">let me put it into cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="1039.21" dur="6.03">because I&amp;#39;m not too keen on the dollar</text>
  <text start="1042.15" dur="4.74">anymore and a lot of people are making</text>
  <text start="1045.24" dur="3.3">the switch now are there a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1046.89" dur="4.56">that know about cryptocurrency right now</text>
  <text start="1048.54" dur="4.02">no not really a lot of people never even</text>
  <text start="1051.45" dur="2.79">heard of it actually if you heard your</text>
  <text start="1052.56" dur="2.94">name or maybe they heard of it but they</text>
  <text start="1054.24" dur="3.21">really don&amp;#39;t understand it they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1055.5" dur="3.56">in it and right now this is the</text>
  <text start="1057.45" dur="4.05">beginning stage just like the internet</text>
  <text start="1059.06" dur="4.44">when it first came out you know everyone</text>
  <text start="1061.5" dur="8.49">was like will the World Wide Web</text>
  <text start="1063.5" dur="8.38">www everyone knows what it is they used</text>
  <text start="1069.99" dur="4.14">it every single day but when it was</text>
  <text start="1071.88" dur="4.89">first introduced there weren&amp;#39;t that many</text>
  <text start="1074.13" dur="5.21">people using it the same thing is</text>
  <text start="1076.77" dur="5.31">happening with the crypto industry and</text>
  <text start="1079.34" dur="4.57">once again there&amp;#39;s a lot of crypto</text>
  <text start="1082.08" dur="5.4">currencies out there a lot of them are</text>
  <text start="1083.91" dur="5.82">not even currencies their technology to</text>
  <text start="1087.48" dur="4.04">be used with something else and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1089.73" dur="5.52">going to go through this period of</text>
  <text start="1091.52" dur="6.82">removing a lot of the garbage and there</text>
  <text start="1095.25" dur="6.06">will be a few that will rise to the top</text>
  <text start="1098.34" dur="5.94">and we can see as we get closer and</text>
  <text start="1101.31" dur="6.47">closer to the economy imploding this is</text>
  <text start="1104.28" dur="6.66">a chance for the people around the world</text>
  <text start="1107.78" dur="5.23">to say you know something we&amp;#39;re done</text>
  <text start="1110.94" dur="4.29">with the banks we&amp;#39;re done with the</text>
  <text start="1113.01" dur="4.92">central banking system we are taking</text>
  <text start="1115.23" dur="6.96">charge we actually have something now</text>
  <text start="1117.93" dur="6.869">where we can control what we do</text>
  <text start="1122.19" dur="5.239">and we can see right now that once this</text>
  <text start="1124.799" dur="5.181">happens and the people around the world</text>
  <text start="1127.429" dur="4.96">decides this and it&amp;#39;s not a very big</text>
  <text start="1129.98" dur="4.84">jump to do this because all they have to</text>
  <text start="1132.389" dur="4.02">do is say I&amp;#39;m not dealing with this I&amp;#39;m</text>
