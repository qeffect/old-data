  <text start="61.34" dur="4.68">episode is the covert plan is working in</text>
  <text start="64.13" dur="5.64">conjunction with the collapse of the</text>
  <text start="66.02" dur="6.38">economy let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="69.77" dur="5.85">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="72.4" dur="5.59">now the corporate media the neocons the</text>
  <text start="75.62" dur="4.38">central bank the deep state they are</text>
  <text start="77.99" dur="6.06">continually pushing their investigation</text>
  <text start="80" dur="6.06">to find something that can be sent out</text>
  <text start="84.05" dur="3.9">on the airwaves to let everyone know</text>
  <text start="86.06" dur="3.75">that Trump has been colluding with</text>
  <text start="87.95" dur="3.54">Russia or at least someone in his</text>
  <text start="89.81" dur="3.72">administration has been colluding with</text>
  <text start="91.49" dur="4.53">Russia and they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="93.53" dur="5.58">possibly can to find something now in</text>
  <text start="96.02" dur="7.31">regards to Michael Flynn they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="99.11" dur="6.18">that yes he has colluded with Russia</text>
  <text start="103.33" dur="5.38">because what they&amp;#39;re saying is he</text>
  <text start="105.29" dur="6.81">received funds and he didn&amp;#39;t disclose</text>
  <text start="108.71" dur="5.76">these funds for a speaking engagement in</text>
  <text start="112.1" dur="5.43">Russia and lobbying activities on behalf</text>
  <text start="114.47" dur="4.89">of Turkey and Chaffetz confirmed that</text>
  <text start="117.53" dur="5.25">Flynn had failed to reveal more than</text>
  <text start="119.36" dur="8.459">45,000 as he was paid to speak at a 2015</text>
  <text start="122.78" dur="7.5">gala for RT so as of right now this is</text>
  <text start="127.819" dur="4.141">what they have and this is what the</text>
  <text start="130.28" dur="3.18">corporate media is out there publishing</text>
  <text start="131.96" dur="4.38">The Wall Street Journal the Washington</text>
  <text start="133.46" dur="6.03">Post and the rest are pushing this out</text>
  <text start="136.34" dur="4.89">there to see see look there is Russian</text>
  <text start="139.49" dur="4.14">collusion I don&amp;#39;t really consider this</text>
  <text start="141.23" dur="5.46">Russian collusion but we can see that</text>
  <text start="143.63" dur="6.87">many politicians many individuals do a</text>
  <text start="146.69" dur="6.95">lot of speeches I mean think about Tim</text>
  <text start="150.5" dur="6.84">Geithner when he was being brought into</text>
  <text start="153.64" dur="8.5">the government as the Treasury secretary</text>
  <text start="157.34" dur="6.78">he didn&amp;#39;t pay his taxes of $100,000 and</text>
  <text start="162.14" dur="4.2">nobody had him and he was going to run</text>
  <text start="164.12" dur="4.35">the Treasury and nobody had a problem</text>
  <text start="166.34" dur="4.74">and you have to remember most of</text>
  <text start="168.47" dur="4.59">Congress right now they receive funds</text>
  <text start="171.08" dur="5.43">from all over the place and if we really</text>
  <text start="173.06" dur="5.82">go into any of these individuals like</text>
  <text start="176.51" dur="4.47">Maxine Waters who&amp;#39;s been giving funds to</text>
  <text start="178.88" dur="3.67">her daughter or many others like Dianne</text>
  <text start="180.98" dur="3.7">Feinstein with her</text>
  <text start="182.55" dur="4.23">husband and getting all these contracts</text>
  <text start="184.68" dur="3.72">you will find things that you will not</text>
  <text start="186.78" dur="2.61">believe but they&amp;#39;re going along with</text>
  <text start="188.4" dur="3.63">this and they&amp;#39;re saying that the White</text>
  <text start="189.39" dur="4.5">House denies us House committee requests</text>
  <text start="192.03" dur="4.17">for internal fund documents and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="193.89" dur="5.01">really building this up now yesterday we</text>
  <text start="196.2" dur="4.14">talked about how Trump and sessions</text>
  <text start="198.9" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;re going after wiki leak</text>
  <text start="200.34" dur="4.41">even though that Trump said that he</text>
  <text start="202.2" dur="4.59">loves WikiLeaks then he flip-flopped and</text>
  <text start="204.75" dur="5.73">says she doesn&amp;#39;t love WikiLeaks let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="206.79" dur="5.85">get them and we made a mention of maybe</text>
  <text start="210.48" dur="5.51">this is being used for another reason</text>
  <text start="212.64" dur="5.46">now Attorney General Jeff session is</text>
  <text start="215.99" dur="4.09">reportedly prepping to throw the book at</text>
  <text start="218.1" dur="3.66">WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange for</text>
  <text start="220.08" dur="3.96">allegedly aiding Edward Snowden in</text>
  <text start="221.76" dur="4.47">disclosing a trove of classified</text>
  <text start="224.04" dur="4.14">documents until now bringing charges</text>
  <text start="226.23" dur="3.78">against WikiLeaks had given Justice</text>
  <text start="228.18" dur="5.45">Department officials heartburn because</text>
  <text start="230.01" dur="7.14">other media outlets had hmm similarly</text>
  <text start="233.63" dur="5.89">published stolen materials but new</text>
  <text start="237.15" dur="3.99">revelations about Snowden had been</text>
  <text start="239.52" dur="4.47">accompanied by an attorney general who</text>
  <text start="241.14" dur="6.59">also might be willing to widen the scope</text>
  <text start="243.99" dur="7.59">of such prosecutions to other news</text>
  <text start="247.73" dur="5.35">outlets very interesting does this mean</text>
  <text start="251.58" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re going to be looking into other</text>
  <text start="253.08" dur="6.69">news outlets and they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="255.78" dur="7.65">investigating on their connections on</text>
  <text start="259.77" dur="6.18">how they receive certain leaks because</text>
  <text start="263.43" dur="5.52">if they do it to one they have to do it</text>
  <text start="265.95" dur="5.1">to others or is the corporate media</text>
  <text start="268.95" dur="4.56">going to come out and support WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="271.05" dur="4.619">and say no this is against the First</text>
  <text start="273.51" dur="5.88">Amendment you cannot do this because</text>
  <text start="275.669" dur="7.741">once they do this they can never say</text>
  <text start="279.39" dur="7.77">anything about WikiLeaks again so is</text>
  <text start="283.41" dur="6.48">this a plan to trap the corporate media</text>
  <text start="287.16" dur="5.22">because they have them trapped on either</text>
  <text start="289.89" dur="4.83">side here because if they allow the</text>
  <text start="292.38" dur="5.91">investigation they will be investigate</text>
  <text start="294.72" dur="6.15">if they support WikiLeaks well now</text>
  <text start="298.29" dur="6.27">they&amp;#39;re supporting WikiLeaks this seems</text>
  <text start="300.87" dur="7.2">like a very good move now we see that</text>
  <text start="304.56" dur="6.63">the Wall Street Journal and many other</text>
  <text start="308.07" dur="6.06">corporate media publications are out</text>
  <text start="311.19" dur="5.199">there saying that it looks like Russia</text>
  <text start="314.13" dur="4.809">is cyber attacking</text>
  <text start="316.389" dur="5.49">the French presidential frontrunner and</text>
  <text start="318.939" dur="6.931">maybe the elections and this is coming</text>
  <text start="321.879" dur="6.871">from a security firm Trend Micro saying</text>
  <text start="325.87" dur="4.259">that there are digital fingerprints that</text>
  <text start="328.75" dur="4.229">it looks like it could be Russian</text>
  <text start="330.129" dur="6.711">hacking maybe we&amp;#39;re not sure because it</text>
  <text start="332.979" dur="7.53">matches the fingerprints of the DNC</text>
  <text start="336.84" dur="6.099">hacking now we know from vault seven the</text>
  <text start="340.509" dur="4.921">CIA does have the ability to make it</text>
  <text start="342.939" dur="4.5">look like Russia did hack something and</text>
  <text start="345.43" dur="3.81">if Russia was going to actually hack</text>
  <text start="347.439" dur="3.51">something why would they leave</text>
  <text start="349.24" dur="4.26">breadcrumbs why would they leave any</text>
  <text start="350.949" dur="5.101">information and to track this back</text>
  <text start="353.5" dur="5.099">through servers completely impossible</text>
  <text start="356.05" dur="5.22">now they&amp;#39;re saying if a Russian</text>
  <text start="358.599" dur="4.861">connection is proved the hacking would</text>
  <text start="361.27" dur="4.53">add two mounting allegations that Moscow</text>
  <text start="363.46" dur="4.62">is backing attempts to influence Western</text>
  <text start="365.8" dur="4.769">elections in favor of candidates with</text>
  <text start="368.08" dur="5.339">policies potentially more friendly to</text>
  <text start="370.569" dur="6.03">the Kremlin now this is because macron</text>
  <text start="373.419" dur="5.46">and lepen they are now running against</text>
  <text start="376.599" dur="5.85">each other and they&amp;#39;re very nervous that</text>
  <text start="378.879" dur="7.551">lepen might win as we know Obama called</text>
  <text start="382.449" dur="7.231">macron and he supported macron and</text>
  <text start="386.43" dur="5.53">basically he kind of interfered with the</text>
  <text start="389.68" dur="5.039">elections because he threw his support</text>
  <text start="391.96" dur="4.019">for this candidate very interesting and</text>
  <text start="394.719" dur="3.26">this is the same thing they blame Russia</text>
  <text start="395.979" dur="4.831">in doing but of course they added the</text>
  <text start="397.979" dur="4.69">Russian hacking part of it but something</text>
  <text start="400.81" dur="5.639">very interesting we need to understand</text>
  <text start="402.669" dur="6.42">about all of this that on March 6 France</text>
  <text start="406.449" dur="4.59">announced that internet voting which had</text>
  <text start="409.089" dur="4.2">previously been offered to citizens</text>
  <text start="411.039" dur="5.1">abroad would not be permitted in the</text>
  <text start="413.289" dur="7.261">2017 legislative elections due to cyber</text>
  <text start="416.139" dur="7.231">security concerns now there are 40 5.7</text>
  <text start="420.55" dur="5.579">million registered voters in France the</text>
  <text start="423.37" dur="5.909">vast majority of voting in France is</text>
  <text start="426.129" dur="5.31">going to be done by paper ballot and</text>
  <text start="429.279" dur="5.371">counted by hand</text>
  <text start="431.439" dur="8.311">each paper ballot will be dropped into a</text>
  <text start="434.65" dur="8.87">clear glass box there is no electronic</text>
  <text start="439.75" dur="6.839">voting and very few voting machines</text>
  <text start="443.52" dur="6.55">nothing can be hacked here so when</text>
  <text start="446.589" dur="6.081">whatever story you&amp;#39;re hearing about</text>
  <text start="450.07" dur="6.27">her attacks on the French election or</text>
  <text start="452.67" dur="4.18">hacking into McCrone or anything like</text>
  <text start="456.34" dur="3.36">that</text>
  <text start="456.85" dur="5.37">well that is completely fake phony and</text>
  <text start="459.7" dur="4.95">false yep maybe they&amp;#39;re hacking into his</text>
  <text start="462.22" dur="4.83">servers but this is not going to help</text>
  <text start="464.65" dur="5.1">with the elections whatsoever now they</text>
  <text start="467.05" dur="4.86">tried pushing the idea of fake news they</text>
  <text start="469.75" dur="4.23">had the a terrorist attack to stop the</text>
  <text start="471.91" dur="3.18">elections and you can see what is</text>
  <text start="473.98" dur="3.65">happening right now</text>
  <text start="475.09" dur="7.89">they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="477.63" dur="7.66">to sway the elections to make sure their</text>
  <text start="482.98" dur="4.71">candidate wins and I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="485.29" dur="5.91">deep state the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="487.69" dur="6.39">neocons they want macron they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="491.2" dur="5.67">lepen and you could see this is what</text>
  <text start="494.08" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to do and we can see</text>
  <text start="496.87" dur="5.43">right now that all this cyber attacks</text>
  <text start="499.33" dur="5.54">and all this hacking is absolutely</text>
  <text start="502.3" dur="5.49">meaningless once again it is completely</text>
  <text start="504.87" dur="7.299">made-up and they have no evidence</text>
  <text start="507.79" dur="7.95">whatsoever and the elections cannot be</text>
  <text start="512.169" dur="6.121">altered because it&amp;#39;s paper ballots now</text>
  <text start="515.74" dur="5.4">Alan Venezuela we see things are really</text>
  <text start="518.29" dur="6.27">heating up the people are struggling the</text>
  <text start="521.14" dur="6.39">country not doing well whatsoever</text>
  <text start="524.56" dur="6.21">and according to the leader the US</text>
  <text start="527.53" dur="6.87">government wrote up a coup scenario for</text>
  <text start="530.77" dur="6.27">opposition leader julio bore hayes a day</text>
  <text start="534.4" dur="4.65">before opposition leader convene more</text>
  <text start="537.04" dur="4.29">protests in Caracas calling for the</text>
  <text start="539.05" dur="4.35">ouster of Venezuela&amp;#39;s government the</text>
  <text start="541.33" dur="4.26">country leader has accused the United</text>
  <text start="543.4" dur="6">States of working with the right wing</text>
  <text start="545.59" dur="6.12">leaders towards a coup and Maduro is out</text>
  <text start="549.4" dur="4.26">there saying that the US government the</text>
  <text start="551.71" dur="4.77">State Department has given the green</text>
  <text start="553.66" dur="6.15">light the approval for a coup process to</text>
  <text start="556.48" dur="4.77">intervene in Venezuela now we know the</text>
  <text start="559.81" dur="3.81">United States has been trying to get</text>
  <text start="561.25" dur="4.98">into Venezuela for a very long time they</text>
  <text start="563.62" dur="4.17">want the oil there they want the natural</text>
  <text start="566.23" dur="3.84">resources and we&amp;#39;ve seen happen in</text>
  <text start="567.79" dur="7.11">Ukraine we seen happen in Libya Yemen</text>
  <text start="570.07" dur="8.58">Somalia Iraq ongoing in Syria Somalia</text>
  <text start="574.9" dur="6.18">Sudan Yemen we see it all over the place</text>
  <text start="578.65" dur="5.19">and we see right now that Maduro is</text>
  <text start="581.08" dur="3.72">saying that he realizes this</text>
  <text start="583.84" dur="3.45">is what they&amp;#39;ve been trying to do</text>
  <text start="584.8" dur="4.05">because the central banks they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="587.29" dur="3.86">putting a lot of pressure on Venezuela</text>
  <text start="588.85" dur="4.77">trying to squeeze the country</text>
  <text start="591.15" dur="5.14">economically and they&amp;#39;ve been doing this</text>
  <text start="593.62" dur="5.55">for a quite for quite a while right now</text>
  <text start="596.29" dur="5.16">to try to get the leader out from his</text>
  <text start="599.17" dur="5.55">position and we could see right now that</text>
  <text start="601.45" dur="6.15">Maduro is fighting back he&amp;#39;s saying no</text>
  <text start="604.72" dur="3.84">more coos and he&amp;#39;s going to stop this</text>
  <text start="607.6" dur="2.73">now we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch this</text>
  <text start="608.56" dur="3.93">very carefully to see what happens but</text>
  <text start="610.33" dur="4.05">we can see that the United States the</text>
  <text start="612.49" dur="4.2">intelligence agencies of the deep state</text>
  <text start="614.38" dur="5.79">they are still pushing their agenda yes</text>
  <text start="616.69" dur="5.13">they do exist and they still are pushing</text>
  <text start="620.17" dur="4.59">their agenda it&amp;#39;s almost like the</text>
  <text start="621.82" dur="5.31">Islamic state in Syria they still exist</text>
  <text start="624.76" dur="3.69">but they&amp;#39;re there Network and what</text>
  <text start="627.13" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re doing is getting smaller and</text>
  <text start="628.45" dur="4.05">smaller and smaller and just like the</text>
  <text start="631.12" dur="2.94">Russian forces and the Syrian forces</text>
  <text start="632.5" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re gaining more ground in the</text>
  <text start="634.06" dur="5.01">becoming stronger and stronger wiping</text>
  <text start="636.07" dur="5.25">out the Islamic site the the individuals</text>
  <text start="639.07" dur="3.6">behind Trump who are trying to get rid</text>
  <text start="641.32" dur="3.15">of the deep State the neocons in the</text>
  <text start="642.67" dur="3.63">Central Bank they are getting stronger</text>
  <text start="644.47" dur="3.96">and stronger and the deep state is</text>
  <text start="646.3" dur="4.47">getting smaller and smaller and once</text>
  <text start="648.43" dur="3.81">they become more and more as they get</text>
  <text start="650.77" dur="3.78">smaller and smaller I should say they</text>
  <text start="652.24" dur="3.96">become desperate and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="654.55" dur="4.02">looking at right now they still have the</text>
  <text start="656.2" dur="5.58">ability to create events they still have</text>
  <text start="658.57" dur="6.03">the ability to push agendas but as time</text>
  <text start="661.78" dur="4.92">goes on and as the base shrinks it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="664.6" dur="3.9">going to be more more difficult to do</text>
  <text start="666.7" dur="4.29">this and this is what we&amp;#39;re watching and</text>
  <text start="668.5" dur="5.43">as when they reach a point where okay</text>
  <text start="670.99" dur="6.15">they say listen we either pull this</text>
  <text start="673.93" dur="5.85">event off and get us into war or we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="677.14" dur="4.65">done for that&amp;#39;s the point that we need</text>
  <text start="679.78" dur="3.78">to be nervous about this is the point</text>
  <text start="681.79" dur="4.17">where they&amp;#39;re going to use everything</text>
  <text start="683.56" dur="5.43">they possibly have to try to bring us to</text>
  <text start="685.96" dur="6.36">war now out in Kiev we understand that</text>
  <text start="688.99" dur="4.95">Graham and McCain they visited Kiev they</text>
  <text start="692.32" dur="3.57">said this is the year the offensive and</text>
  <text start="693.94" dur="4.35">we see that Kiev they just cut off the</text>
  <text start="695.89" dur="4.35">electricity to lagoons right now and</text>

  <text start="930.25" dur="5.1">China make a big deal about it</text>
  <text start="932.32" dur="5.4">no why is the United States making such</text>
  <text start="935.35" dur="5.34">a big deal about North Korea well</text>
  <text start="937.72" dur="5.43">because they have an opium market and</text>
  <text start="940.69" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re cutting into the business of the</text>
  <text start="943.15" dur="5.04">CIA with Afghanistan with their opium</text>

  <text start="950.65" dur="5.04">see right now they&amp;#39;re pushing their</text>
  <text start="952.42" dur="5.58">agenda now Secretary of Defense Fallon</text>
  <text start="955.69" dur="5.1">out in Britain he said something very</text>
  <text start="958" dur="5.4">interesting saying that under the most</text>
  <text start="960.79" dur="5.61">extreme circumstances even if Britain</text>
  <text start="963.4" dur="7.38">itself was not under attack we would use</text>
  <text start="966.4" dur="6.42">nuclear weapons as a first strike now as</text>
  <text start="970.78" dur="5.13">we can see these neocons the deep state</text>
  <text start="972.82" dur="5.46">they are trigger-happy and they want to</text>
  <text start="975.91" dur="4.44">fire nuclear weapons really really bad I</text>
  <text start="978.28" dur="5.4">mean you could just see it that they</text>
  <text start="980.35" dur="4.859">just want war now they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="983.68" dur="3.689">wait and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="985.209" dur="4.05">listen we will strike first even if no</text>
  <text start="987.369" dur="3.45">one fired a nuclear weapon at us and we</text>
  <text start="989.259" dur="2.88">feel that we&amp;#39;re under threat we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="990.819" dur="4.38">going to fire nuclear weapons at this</text>
  <text start="992.139" dur="6.75">country I mean this is how insane it has</text>
  <text start="995.199" dur="5.31">gotten now China they have launched</text>
  <text start="998.889" dur="4.44">their first domestically built aircraft</text>
  <text start="1000.509" dur="4.38">carrier and they&amp;#39;re putting it to the</text>
  <text start="1003.329" dur="5.12">test and they&amp;#39;re gonna be selling this</text>
  <text start="1004.889" dur="7.411">into the South China Seas and again</text>
  <text start="1008.449" dur="6.19">China is building up their Navy they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1012.3" dur="5.49">building more and more ships and the</text>
  <text start="1014.639" dur="4.831">question again is why why are they doing</text>
  <text start="1017.79" dur="3.51">this because they see what United States</text>
  <text start="1019.47" dur="4.049">has been doing throughout the years</text>
  <text start="1021.3" dur="3.21">bringing in military assets into the</text>
  <text start="1023.519" dur="3.121">South China Sea</text>
  <text start="1024.51" dur="4.5">bringing military assets into the Middle</text>
  <text start="1026.64" dur="4.59">East into Africa bringing military</text>
  <text start="1029.01" dur="4.079">assets into Eastern Europe and this is</text>
  <text start="1031.23" dur="3.419">why Russia and China they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1033.089" dur="3.33">building their military because they</text>
  <text start="1034.649" dur="4.02">realized eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1036.419" dur="4.441">happen is the dollar is going to die the</text>
  <text start="1038.669" dur="4.86">neocons a deep state the central bankers</text>
  <text start="1040.86" dur="5.25">they are going to try to start a war and</text>
  <text start="1043.529" dur="5.071">we can see that everything that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1046.11" dur="4.559">happening in Syria well the plan hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1048.6" dur="4.23">been going very well now we need to</text>
  <text start="1050.669" dur="4.14">understand that they&amp;#39;ve had this plan</text>
  <text start="1052.83" dur="5.43">for a very long time to go into Syria</text>
  <text start="1054.809" dur="5.61">then Iran and the plan did not work out</text>
  <text start="1058.26" dur="5.279">whatsoever and what is happening right</text>
  <text start="1060.419" dur="6.211">now is that they are trying to figure</text>
  <text start="1063.539" dur="4.681">out a way of completing their plan</text>
  <text start="1066.63" dur="3.87">because they thought they were going to</text>
  <text start="1068.22" dur="3.6">have the entire Middle East they were</text>
  <text start="1070.5" dur="3">going to have regime change in all these</text>
  <text start="1071.82" dur="3.54">countries all these countries were going</text>
  <text start="1073.5" dur="4.08">to be using the dollar to sell their oil</text>
  <text start="1075.36" dur="3.689">and everything was going to be happily</text>
  <text start="1077.58" dur="3.089">ever after and again they were going to</text>
  <text start="1079.049" dur="3.961">have Iran they&amp;#39;re gonna have Syria and</text>
  <text start="1080.669" dur="5.87">the rest of the nations right now they</text>
  <text start="1083.01" dur="6.419">can&amp;#39;t even get Syria now they saw this</text>
  <text start="1086.539" dur="4.691">during Obama&amp;#39;s term and this is why they</text>
  <text start="1089.429" dur="3.661">decided to push the p5 plus 1 deal</text>
  <text start="1091.23" dur="3.54">because remember they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="1093.09" dur="4.14">invading those countries that have</text>
  <text start="1094.77" dur="5.07">nuclear weapons for regime change and</text>
  <text start="1097.23" dur="5.22">they thought okay listen maybe we can</text>
  <text start="1099.84" dur="4.86">try this plan p5 plus one will have</text>
  <text start="1102.45" dur="6.089">inspectors come in make sure that Iran</text>
  <text start="1104.7" dur="5.969">never develops a nuclear weapon during</text>
  <text start="1108.539" dur="4.981">the same period since we&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="1110.669" dur="5.581">trouble with Syria let&amp;#39;s see if they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1113.52" dur="4.98">go along with this dáil and we&amp;#39;ll remove</text>
  <text start="1116.25" dur="2.83">the sanctions and we&amp;#39;ll try to get the</text>
  <text start="1118.5" dur="2.44">IMF</text>
  <text start="1119.08" dur="4.709">there to manage their central bank and</text>
  <text start="1120.94" dur="5.39">the spirit of the deal is that they will</text>
  <text start="1123.789" dur="5.791">use the dollar to sell their oil and</text>
  <text start="1126.33" dur="5.469">what happened was Iran didn&amp;#39;t use the</text>
  <text start="1129.58" dur="4.5">dollar to sell their oil they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1131.799" dur="4.201">want the IMF to manage the central bank</text>
  <text start="1134.08" dur="3.78">they decided to use the euro and then</text>
  <text start="1136" dur="4.86">eventually switch most likely to the</text>
  <text start="1137.86" dur="4.71">ruble whether you want and we can see</text>
  <text start="1140.86" dur="4.62">this was all set up because they knew</text>
  <text start="1142.57" dur="4.65">eventually once they got into into a</text>
  <text start="1145.48" dur="4.559">Syria they were going to go into Iran</text>
  <text start="1147.22" dur="5.1">but there were two parts of the deal one</text>
  <text start="1150.039" dur="4.98">to take control of the central bank and</text>
  <text start="1152.32" dur="4.8">have them forced into using the dollar</text>
  <text start="1155.019" dur="5.581">to sell their oil if that didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="1157.12" dur="6.39">well at least they made sure they never</text>
  <text start="1160.6" dur="5.34">developed a nuclear weapon and here we</text>
  <text start="1163.51" dur="4.98">are today where they&amp;#39;re still trying to</text>
  <text start="1165.94" dur="5.489">make their move in Syria and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1168.49" dur="5.549">the p5 plus 1 deal was created now</text>
  <text start="1171.429" dur="4.35">Russia and the other countries around</text>

  <text start="1337.539" dur="4.531">yesterday I talked about Trump and all</text>
  <text start="1340.509" dur="4.951">the indicators that were looking at and</text>
  <text start="1342.07" dur="6">the purpose of that was to see if Trump</text>
  <text start="1345.46" dur="4.919">was part of a deep State or not part of</text>
  <text start="1348.07" dur="4.829">the deep State and this is what we are</text>

  <text start="1352.899" dur="4.38">collapse in front of our eyes just like</text>
  <text start="1355.119" dur="5.461">the Islamic state is collapsing out in</text>
  <text start="1357.279" dur="6.36">Syria as the deep state collapses they</text>
  <text start="1360.58" dur="6.12">become more and more desperate as those</text>
  <text start="1363.639" dur="5.13">individuals who are in power to get rid</text>
  <text start="1366.7" dur="4.049">of them which I believe is the Trump</text>

  <text start="1385.989" dur="3.631">up all the</text>
  <text start="1387.07" dur="4.26">to bring down this economy he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1389.62" dur="3.87">along with what the deep state wants</text>
  <text start="1391.33" dur="3.75">geopolitically we can see that he has</text>
  <text start="1393.49" dur="3.63">done nothing with Syria but we</text>
  <text start="1395.08" dur="3.33">understand that Mike cirrage has said</text>
  <text start="1397.12" dur="4.35">that there could be something happening</text>
  <text start="1398.41" dur="5.28">June 1st if I was going to do this and I</text>
  <text start="1401.47" dur="4.47">was going to file a deep state plan I</text>
  <text start="1403.69" dur="4.56">believe that they would have done this</text>
  <text start="1405.94" dur="3.83">most likely around August 1st because</text>
  <text start="1408.25" dur="4.89">this is when Congress goes on vacation</text>
  <text start="1409.77" dur="4.99">now we need to look at all other aspects</text>

  <text start="1414.76" dur="3.75">is not part of the deep state or is part</text>

  <text start="1418.51" dur="4.14">indicators and from what I&amp;#39;m seeing</text>
  <text start="1419.65" dur="5.73">right now I see that the plan is being</text>
  <text start="1422.65" dur="4.74">pushed to bring the economy down to call</text>
  <text start="1425.38" dur="4.29">out the deep state to call out the</text>
  <text start="1427.39" dur="4.71">central bank and to restart the system</text>
  <text start="1429.67" dur="4.41">does this mean that this is not going to</text>
