  <text start="88.619" dur="5.321">we have to see if sessions continues on</text>
  <text start="91.63" dur="4.59">this path but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="93.94" dur="5.789">now is that the corporate media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="96.22" dur="6.06">just going crazy over this and when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="99.729" dur="4.411">going to happen is that McCabe is going</text>
  <text start="102.28" dur="4.5">to be brought up on criminal charges and</text>
  <text start="104.14" dur="5.85">I think the last thing he needs to worry</text>
  <text start="106.78" dur="5.64">about is his pension now we can see</text>
  <text start="109.99" dur="3.9">already the go fund me accounts have</text>

  <text start="116.2" dur="3.269">saying oh I can get you a job so you can</text>
  <text start="118.119" dur="4.171">keep your pension I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="119.469" dur="6.72">how it works but we see right now that</text>
  <text start="122.29" dur="6.09">they are pushing this very hard trying</text>
  <text start="126.189" dur="6.511">to make it seem like McCabe is the</text>
  <text start="128.38" dur="8.97">victim and we&amp;#39;re going to see criminal</text>
  <text start="132.7" dur="8.22">charges brought up against Andrew McCabe</text>

  <text start="140.92" dur="4.23">lists boom boom boom what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="143.079" dur="4.111">interesting is that cue was out there</text>
  <text start="145.15" dur="6.72">and he was talking about March Madness</text>
  <text start="147.19" dur="9.63">and The Wall Street Journal called the</text>
  <text start="151.87" dur="7.11">McCabe March Madness which I find very</text>
  <text start="156.82" dur="4.53">interesting because that&amp;#39;s exactly what</text>
  <text start="158.98" dur="4.319">Q said get ready for March Madness and</text>

  <text start="390.76" dur="4.32">quite a while a lot of the alternative</text>
  <text start="392.71" dur="4.26">media channels have been reporting on</text>

  <text start="410.65" dur="4.44">United States where we thought that oh</text>
  <text start="413.2" dur="3.87">the deep state they weren&amp;#39;t going to be</text>
  <text start="415.09" dur="4.71">drained the swamp wasn&amp;#39;t going to be</text>
  <text start="417.07" dur="4.74">drained we&amp;#39;re actually seeing the swamp</text>
  <text start="419.8" dur="4.53">drained this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing all</text>
  <text start="421.81" dur="6.63">these firings this is why we see all</text>
  <text start="424.33" dur="5.88">this information coming out and the</text>
  <text start="428.44" dur="3.68">corporate media is trying to make head</text>
  <text start="430.21" dur="4.05">to tail this and try to explain it away</text>
  <text start="432.12" dur="3.7">Putin is out there saying that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="434.26" dur="4.32">going to reduce his military spending</text>
  <text start="435.82" dur="4.65">during his new term as the leader saying</text>
  <text start="438.58" dur="4.44">there&amp;#39;s no reason to have the military</text>
  <text start="440.47" dur="5.07">buildup anymore and do I think he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="443.02" dur="4.71">gonna cut it to zero no but I think they</text>
  <text start="445.54" dur="3.51">do have very advanced weaponry a lot</text>
  <text start="447.73" dur="4.469">more advanced than the United States</text>
  <text start="449.05" dur="6.989">they kind of proved it and he announced</text>
  <text start="452.199" dur="7.141">and he told the deep state listen don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="456.039" dur="6.69">try anything and we could see right now</text>
  <text start="459.34" dur="5.879">that this is the message they wanted out</text>
  <text start="462.729" dur="6.21">there now there are certain lawmakers</text>
  <text start="465.219" dur="7.35">like Senator Bob Menendez where they are</text>
  <text start="468.939" dur="6.66">trying to stop Russia from selling the</text>
  <text start="472.569" dur="5.46">s400 air defense system they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="475.599" dur="5.34">no they can&amp;#39;t do this because it&amp;#39;s under</text>
  <text start="478.029" dur="5.54">the sanctions so they should not be</text>
  <text start="480.939" dur="5.551">allowed to sell their s400 to countries</text>
  <text start="483.569" dur="4.6">why do you think they are doing this</text>
  <text start="486.49" dur="5.959">think about the countries that are</text>
  <text start="488.169" dur="10.821">purchasing the s400 system Iran Syria</text>
  <text start="492.449" dur="9.43">Egypt Turkey Iraq is looking into it and</text>
  <text start="498.99" dur="5.229">you&amp;#39;re going to see many other countries</text>
  <text start="501.879" dur="4.38">looking to purchase the system the</text>
  <text start="504.219" dur="5.07">reason they&amp;#39;re doing this is because</text>
  <text start="506.259" dur="6.69">they realize that this system will</text>
  <text start="509.289" dur="6.841">protect their country from an air</text>
  <text start="512.949" dur="6.09">invasion and those people that are</text>
  <text start="516.13" dur="5.219">within the inside the neocons the deep</text>
  <text start="519.039" dur="3.66">state they don&amp;#39;t want these countries to</text>
  <text start="521.349" dur="5.071">have it and if more and more countries</text>
  <text start="522.699" dur="7.231">get this system they are protected from</text>
  <text start="526.42" dur="8.669">the deep state now it was revealed that</text>
  <text start="529.93" dur="7.519">a Russian nuclear sub quietly traveled</text>
  <text start="535.089" dur="6.75">to the u.s. coast line completely</text>
  <text start="537.449" dur="7.211">undetected and is a story true well</text>
  <text start="541.839" dur="5.761">Russia is saying that it is true and</text>
  <text start="544.66" dur="5.31">they were completely undetected no one</text>
  <text start="547.6" dur="5.76">picked up on it and they were able to</text>
  <text start="549.97" dur="7.89">get very close to the u.s. Shores and</text>
  <text start="553.36" dur="7.669">this was a Sukkah B submarine it was</text>
  <text start="557.86" dur="5.729">built in 1986 nuclear-powered sub</text>
  <text start="561.029" dur="5.141">capable of launching caliber cruise</text>
  <text start="563.589" dur="5.19">missiles staying submerged for up to a</text>
  <text start="566.17" dur="5.01">hundred days and they&amp;#39;re saying it was</text>
  <text start="568.779" dur="5.37">completely successful now we need to go</text>
  <text start="571.18" dur="5.61">back in time and look what Russia had</text>
  <text start="574.149" dur="4.44">the ability to do they were able to shut</text>
  <text start="576.79" dur="4.44">down a lot of the Aegis ships in the</text>
  <text start="578.589" dur="3.961">Black Sea they had to be towed away they</text>
  <text start="581.23" dur="4.22">jammed like pretty much all the</text>
  <text start="582.55" dur="6.24">electronics they have</text>
  <text start="585.45" dur="4.87">cruise missiles ballistic missiles which</text>
  <text start="588.79" dur="5.73">are not ballistic missiles that can</text>
  <text start="590.32" dur="6.78">maneuver and they can speed up they can</text>
  <text start="594.52" dur="6.3">slow down they can fly at hypersonic</text>
  <text start="597.1" dur="7.26">speed they can get around the defenses</text>
  <text start="600.82" dur="6.209">of the United States so can they have a</text>
  <text start="604.36" dur="5.88">sub reach the shores of the u.s. being</text>
  <text start="607.029" dur="6.241">undetected I believe so I believe they</text>
  <text start="610.24" dur="7.17">have the technology right now to do this</text>
  <text start="613.27" dur="7.86">and we can see how far beyond behind the</text>
  <text start="617.41" dur="9.9">u.s. is in technology compared to what</text>
  <text start="621.13" dur="10.97">Russia has today now out in Syria we see</text>
  <text start="627.31" dur="9.149">the deep state the neocons they are</text>
  <text start="632.1" dur="8.47">basically in panic mode the Kurdish area</text>
  <text start="636.459" dur="6.271">well that is not going well we see there</text>
  <text start="640.57" dur="4.29">are helicopters coming in there are</text>
  <text start="642.73" dur="5">evacuating the Islamic state commanders</text>
  <text start="644.86" dur="4.95">from the eastern portion of Syria and</text>
  <text start="647.73" dur="5.109">they&amp;#39;re bringing them to different</text>
  <text start="649.81" dur="5.46">locations probably Afghanistan probably</text>
  <text start="652.839" dur="5.101">different parts of Asia and we can see</text>
  <text start="655.27" dur="6.27">right now they&amp;#39;re getting those paid</text>
  <text start="657.94" dur="5.85">mercenary commanders out of the area</text>
  <text start="661.54" dur="4.73">there&amp;#39;s a reason why now the deep state</text>
  <text start="663.79" dur="4.89">they are pushing their agenda right now</text>
  <text start="666.27" dur="4.38">we&amp;#39;re hearing reports that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="668.68" dur="4.77">getting ready for this huge chemical</text>
  <text start="670.65" dur="5.32">attack in Syria do I think it&amp;#39;s gonna go</text>
  <text start="673.45" dur="5.49">well no I don&amp;#39;t I think there&amp;#39;s too much</text>
  <text start="675.97" dur="4.68">on this we know where everything is we</text>
  <text start="678.94" dur="2.97">know who&amp;#39;s going to be doing it we know</text>
  <text start="680.65" dur="3.6">the white helmets have been preparing</text>
  <text start="681.91" dur="3.869">but what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="684.25" dur="3.51">Syrian army they have intercepted a</text>
  <text start="685.779" dur="5.581">truck full of goodies including smoke</text>
  <text start="687.76" dur="8.76">grenades they they include other weapons</text>
  <text start="691.36" dur="8.099">ammunition small arms you name it it had</text>
  <text start="696.52" dur="6.71">it in there and they captured it it was</text>
  <text start="699.459" dur="7.44">headed towards the Ghouta area where the</text>

  <text start="803.82" dur="5.61">more inflation which means the system</text>
  <text start="806.55" dur="4.38">completely falls apart so when you look</text>

  <text start="823.89" dur="7.86">same exact time cut off the funding and</text>
  <text start="827.07" dur="6.48">stop their system completely and we can</text>
  <text start="831.75" dur="6.41">see we&amp;#39;re getting very very close to</text>
  <text start="833.55" dur="8.46">this point in time because once they</text>
  <text start="838.16" dur="8.62">cross this line and they bring the</text>
  <text start="842.01" dur="6.63">troops home the deep state is pretty</text>
  <text start="846.78" dur="4.17">much finished at that point the</text>
  <text start="848.64" dur="3.75">petrodollar system is pretty much</text>
  <text start="850.95" dur="3.42">finished at that point</text>
  <text start="852.39" dur="5.759">and you&amp;#39;ll see it started to create</text>
  <text start="854.37" dur="6.209">degrade over time and it&amp;#39;ll just get</text>
  <text start="858.149" dur="4.281">worse and worse and worse and this is</text>
  <text start="860.579" dur="4.32">where we&amp;#39;ll be entering the transition</text>
  <text start="862.43" dur="5.86">so we can see right now we are in the</text>
  <text start="864.899" dur="5.461">month of March Madness those individuals</text>
