  <text start="39.4" dur="5.28">episode is the current economic collapse</text>
  <text start="41.47" dur="4.62">news brief let&amp;#39;s get right into the</text>
  <text start="44.68" dur="4.199">economic collapse now is now out in</text>
  <text start="46.09" dur="4.86">Greece we see the situation is starting</text>
  <text start="48.879" dur="4.68">to ramp up here we&amp;#39;re seeing that the</text>
  <text start="50.95" dur="5.67">Greek government the central bankers no</text>
  <text start="53.559" dur="6.121">agreement whatsoever we see that the</text>
  <text start="56.62" dur="5.91">Greek Prime Minister tsipras he called a</text>
  <text start="59.68" dur="5.46">referendum on the outcome of the Greek</text>
  <text start="62.53" dur="5.22">bailout talks with the creditors and we</text>
  <text start="65.14" dur="5.55">see just on Saturday people were so</text>
  <text start="67.75" dur="7.38">nervous scared they ran to the banks the</text>
  <text start="70.69" dur="9">atms and just on Saturday they withdrew</text>
  <text start="75.13" dur="5.91">1 billion euros and this is continuing</text>
  <text start="79.69" dur="5.219">because they&amp;#39;re very nervous that come</text>
  <text start="81.04" dur="7.11">Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday whenever</text>
  <text start="84.909" dur="7.14">they decide banks might not reopen it</text>
  <text start="88.15" dur="5.85">they could be Cyprus and we know what</text>
  <text start="92.049" dur="4.311">happened in Cyprus where the bank shut</text>
  <text start="94" dur="6.719">down people couldn&amp;#39;t get their money out</text>
  <text start="96.36" dur="6.64">the banks did a bail and they took their</text>
  <text start="100.719" dur="5.97">money replace it with worthless bank</text>
  <text start="103" dur="8.009">stock now this entire thing if Greece</text>
  <text start="106.689" dur="8.161">does default on their debt this might</text>
  <text start="111.009" dur="5.671">cause and trigger default clauses of</text>
  <text start="114.85" dur="4.11">about a hundred and thirty point nine</text>
  <text start="116.68" dur="6.929">billion euros that Greece owes the euro</text>
  <text start="118.96" dur="8.579">and we might see this occur now this</text>
  <text start="123.609" dur="6.841">might then cascade into a credit default</text>
  <text start="127.539" dur="3.871">swap into a derivative problem and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="130.45" dur="3.36">going to have to watch this very</text>
  <text start="131.41" dur="6.21">carefully we see right now that Vera</text>
  <text start="133.81" dur="7.35">focus the greek Finance Minister is out</text>
  <text start="137.62" dur="8.49">there saying listen banks might be</text>
  <text start="141.16" dur="9">closed we see the ECB freezes the ELA</text>
  <text start="146.11" dur="7.11">for Greece and we see capital controls</text>
  <text start="150.16" dur="5.73">we see in bank closures and so far there</text>
  <text start="153.22" dur="4.56">is no agreement whatsoever it looks like</text>
  <text start="155.89" dur="6.2">the Greek government is leaving it up to</text>
  <text start="157.78" dur="6.27">the people what do you want to do and</text>
  <text start="162.09" dur="5.14">the Greek government</text>
  <text start="164.05" dur="6.21">is looking to have this Greek referendum</text>
  <text start="167.23" dur="7.71">on July fifth and the people are going</text>
  <text start="170.26" dur="6.72">to decide will they go and say okay</text>
  <text start="174.94" dur="4.35">listen we understand it&amp;#39;s bad but we</text>
  <text start="176.98" dur="4.83">want to stay with the euro will take the</text>
  <text start="179.29" dur="5.25">bailout will impose more austerity on</text>
  <text start="181.81" dur="5.55">ourselves we want more taxes we want you</text>
  <text start="184.54" dur="4.59">to cut our pensions or will they go</text>
  <text start="187.36" dur="5.46">ahead and say you know something enough</text>
  <text start="189.13" dur="6.03">is enough we need to exit there is no</text>
  <text start="192.82" dur="6.53">agreement now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="195.16" dur="6.27">that they did a preliminary poll and</text>
  <text start="199.35" dur="5.17">they&amp;#39;re showing that the Greek people</text>
  <text start="201.43" dur="4.41">want the deal with the central bankers</text>
  <text start="204.52" dur="5.42">which makes no sense whatsoever because</text>
  <text start="205.84" dur="6.39">they voted for the tsipras government</text>
  <text start="209.94" dur="5.05">where they said we do not want more</text>
  <text start="212.23" dur="4.71">austerity we don&amp;#39;t want these type of</text>
  <text start="214.99" dur="4.05">agreements anymore it does not spur</text>
  <text start="216.94" dur="4.38">economic growth in our country and here</text>
  <text start="219.04" dur="5.19">they have the initial polls showing that</text>
  <text start="221.32" dur="5.19">the Greek people want this so something</text>
  <text start="224.23" dur="6.36">here doesn&amp;#39;t make sense that I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="226.51" dur="7.62">be surprised if there are other hands in</text>
  <text start="230.59" dur="5.7">this manipulating the poll numbers but</text>
  <text start="234.13" dur="4.14">we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this plays out now</text>
  <text start="236.29" dur="4.83">Greek does have a way out of this I mean</text>
  <text start="238.27" dur="7.62">right now the troika is basically</text>
  <text start="241.12" dur="7.83">blackmailing Greece they&amp;#39;re applying</text>
  <text start="245.89" dur="5.16">strategies of reverse objectives the EU</text>
  <text start="248.95" dur="4.289">does not want grease or any other member</text>
  <text start="251.05" dur="4.92">no matter how weak economically to leave</text>
  <text start="253.239" dur="5.25">the eurozone a Greek exit may risk</text>
  <text start="255.97" dur="8.31">causing a chain reaction which we talked</text>
  <text start="258.489" dur="7.861">about quite a bit the IMF which is the</text>
  <text start="264.28" dur="4.8">extending arm really of the US Treasury</text>
  <text start="266.35" dur="8.64">is really calling the shots in Brussels</text>
  <text start="269.08" dur="8.28">and right now there are two ways of</text>
  <text start="274.99" dur="4.38">going about this one would be the</text>
  <text start="277.36" dur="4.05">traditional one which is defaulting and</text>
  <text start="279.37" dur="4.38">a lot of people don&amp;#39;t realize this I</text>
  <text start="281.41" dur="4.35">mean there are other countries that have</text>
  <text start="283.75" dur="6.18">defaulted before it&amp;#39;s not like this is</text>
  <text start="285.76" dur="7.14">something new and we see that Argentina</text>
  <text start="289.93" dur="6.17">defaulted Bolivia Ecuador and even</text>
  <text start="292.9" dur="3.2">Germany has defaulted</text>
  <text start="296.249" dur="5.76">if Greece decides to default on their</text>
  <text start="298.169" dur="6.9">debt simultaneously they would exit the</text>
  <text start="302.009" dur="5.55">eurozone taking back monetary and fiscal</text>
  <text start="305.069" dur="5.9">autonomy and returning to its own</text>
  <text start="307.559" dur="6.12">currency which is the drachma and we</text>
  <text start="310.969" dur="6.34">understand and we reported on this that</text>
  <text start="313.679" dur="5.76">they redesigned the drachma we also</text>
  <text start="317.309" dur="4.5">understand that Greece has signed the</text>
  <text start="319.439" dur="5.94">agreement with Russia to support the</text>
  <text start="321.809" dur="6.81">Turkish pipeline and which were they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="325.379" dur="7.08">receiving two billion euros they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="328.619" dur="5.64">go with the eurozone and the United</text>
  <text start="332.459" dur="3.24">States government central bankers they</text>
  <text start="334.259" dur="4.41">went with Russia they&amp;#39;re in talks with</text>
  <text start="335.699" dur="6.24">the brick system saying you know what</text>
  <text start="338.669" dur="5.34">maybe we will become a member the next</text>
  <text start="341.939" dur="4.95">step would be to nationalizing and</text>
  <text start="344.009" dur="5.09">regulating Greek banks activating the</text>
  <text start="346.889" dur="5.94">Greek central bank as a sovereign</text>
  <text start="349.099" dur="7.24">institution they will make the monetary</text>
  <text start="352.829" dur="5.64">policy now using local banks to</text>
  <text start="356.339" dur="5.04">jumpstart the local economy followed by</text>
  <text start="358.469" dur="6.03">negotiating Greece&amp;#39;s 360 million euro</text>
  <text start="361.379" dur="4.65">debt with the central bank&amp;#39;s the private</text>
  <text start="364.499" dur="4.59">western central bank system the</text>
  <text start="366.029" dur="6.24">creditors and they will do this with</text>
  <text start="369.089" dur="7.92">their devalued drachma but this will all</text>
  <text start="372.269" dur="6">be on Greece&amp;#39;s terms and conditions so</text>
  <text start="377.009" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch this</text>
  <text start="378.269" dur="6.27">situation because we&amp;#39;re seeing that it</text>
  <text start="380.939" dur="6.45">is ramping up central bankers are</text>
  <text start="384.539" dur="5.73">nervous other countries are watching</text>
  <text start="387.389" dur="4.98">like France Italy Spain to see what</text>
  <text start="390.269" dur="5.31">happens here the United States is</text>
  <text start="392.369" dur="6.96">nervous and this could cause a domino</text>
  <text start="395.579" dur="7.8">effect now we understand here in the</text>
  <text start="399.329" dur="9.33">United States those people who had</text>
  <text start="403.379" dur="8.49">subsidies for Obamacare have and are</text>
  <text start="408.659" dur="4.98">able to keep their subsidies but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="411.869" dur="3.12">very interesting about Obamacare it was</text>
  <text start="413.639" dur="3.24">put into place to tell everyone they</text>
  <text start="414.989" dur="3">were going to get these benefits it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="416.879" dur="3">going to make it better for everybody</text>
  <text start="417.989" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;s going to be low-cost insurance</text>
  <text start="419.879" dur="3.93">where everyone can afford it and</text>
  <text start="421.649" dur="4.38">actually we&amp;#39;ve seen the complete</text>
  <text start="423.809" dur="4.98">opposite of all of this but a recent</text>
  <text start="426.029" dur="4.061">study came out and stated that repealing</text>
  <text start="428.789" dur="3.311">Obamacare</text>
  <text start="430.09" dur="5.04">would cost hundreds of billions of</text>
  <text start="432.1" dur="5.25">dollars to implement this is what they</text>
  <text start="435.13" dur="3.81">keep throwing in our faces that listen</text>
  <text start="437.35" dur="4.8">if we get rid of Obamacare is going to</text>
  <text start="438.94" dur="4.949">cause a lot more money you mean opposed</text>
  <text start="442.15" dur="3.66">to the billions of dollars that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="443.889" dur="4.741">spending to keep Obamacare but let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="445.81" dur="5.91">if this is true the CBO and the JCT</text>
  <text start="448.63" dur="5.15">found that repealing Obamacare would</text>
  <text start="451.72" dur="6.27">increase the gross domestic product by</text>
  <text start="453.78" dur="7.66">0.7% and that effect alone would reduce</text>
  <text start="457.99" dur="8.19">projected deficits by 216 billion over</text>
  <text start="461.44" dur="7.65">the 20 16 to 20 25 period this may sound</text>
  <text start="466.18" dur="5.76">trivial but a point seven percent</text>
  <text start="469.09" dur="5.13">increase in GDP is equivalent to an</text>
  <text start="471.94" dur="6.27">additional 14 hundred dollars in the</text>
  <text start="474.22" dur="6.57">pocket of each household per year the</text>
  <text start="478.21" dur="5.01">CBO also found that repealing Obamacare</text>
  <text start="480.79" dur="5.34">would increase capital stocks and the</text>
  <text start="483.22" dur="4.56">number of people working over the next</text>
  <text start="486.13" dur="5.069">ten years because as we know with</text>
  <text start="487.78" dur="6.359">Obamacare they started limiting the</text>
  <text start="491.199" dur="5.161">number of hours that people worked they</text>
  <text start="494.139" dur="4.441">went from full-time to part-time they</text>
  <text start="496.36" dur="4.08">realize they can hire certain people or</text>
  <text start="498.58" dur="4.559">they&amp;#39;ll be penalized now that option is</text>
  <text start="500.44" dur="5.22">not enforced right now but when it does</text>
  <text start="503.139" dur="3.84">come in force more people are going to</text>
  <text start="505.66" dur="3.18">be let go from work and this is why the</text>
  <text start="506.979" dur="4.291">illegals are coming in because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="508.84" dur="4.56">not covered under this option the</text>
  <text start="511.27" dur="7.41">corporation&amp;#39;s do not have to pay the</text>
  <text start="513.4" dur="7.86">$3,000 penalty so right now Obamacare</text>
  <text start="518.68" dur="5.34">gives no benefit whatsoever and the</text>
  <text start="521.26" dur="4.56">costs because it is a monopoly if you</text>
  <text start="524.02" dur="5.25">really think about it all the insurance</text>
  <text start="525.82" dur="5.55">companies are linked together their</text>
  <text start="529.27" dur="5.4">costs now are linked together there is</text>
  <text start="531.37" dur="5.339">no competition and if they all decide at</text>
  <text start="534.67" dur="5.52">one time to rot to raise the prices</text>
  <text start="536.709" dur="5.971">guess what everyone is brought up to the</text>
  <text start="540.19" dur="5.49">next level and there&amp;#39;s no competition</text>
  <text start="542.68" dur="5.159">anymore this is what we are seeing here</text>
  <text start="545.68" dur="5.55">because we are not in a capitalistic</text>
  <text start="547.839" dur="6.571">society anymore Rene fash cystic society</text>
  <text start="551.23" dur="6.24">right now now we understand that the</text>
  <text start="554.41" dur="5.13">government and certain corporations are</text>
  <text start="557.47" dur="4.71">spying on the people we know the NSA has</text>
  <text start="559.54" dur="4.05">backdoors into pretty much everything</text>
  <text start="562.18" dur="4.59">and news broke that Google</text>
  <text start="563.59" dur="5.58">has been stealth downloading audio</text>
  <text start="566.77" dur="6.87">listeners on to every computer that runs</text>
  <text start="569.17" dur="6.48">chrome and they transmit audio data back</text>
  <text start="573.64" dur="3.81">to Google effectively this means that</text>
  <text start="575.65" dur="4.38">google has taken itself the right to</text>
  <text start="577.45" dur="4.86">listen to everyone&amp;#39;s conversation in</text>
  <text start="580.03" dur="4.53">their room so if you&amp;#39;re running Google</text>
  <text start="582.31" dur="5.16">Chrome this is a problem now of course</text>
  <text start="584.56" dur="4.83">Google went out and they responded to</text>
  <text start="587.47" dur="4.35">this and they said well what you can do</text>
  <text start="589.39" dur="4.8">you can go ahead and shut this option</text>
  <text start="591.82" dur="4.64">off by default it&amp;#39;s on so you can go</text>
  <text start="594.19" dur="5.13">into google chrome and shut it off or</text>
  <text start="596.46" dur="4.99">you can switch browsers this is not</text>
  <text start="599.32" dur="4.49">their response this is my response you</text>
  <text start="601.45" dur="5.46">can use other browsers like Firefox or</text>
  <text start="603.81" dur="5.26">any other browser look through your</text>

  <text start="609.07" dur="5.55">sending data to places you don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="611.53" dur="5.64">your data to go and we understand that</text>
  <text start="614.62" dur="4.53">the NSA continually has back doors and</text>
  <text start="617.17" dur="3.99">corporations now under the new USA</text>
  <text start="619.15" dur="3.6">Freedom Act they&amp;#39;re going to continually</text>
  <text start="621.16" dur="4.5">spy on the people because all they did</text>
  <text start="622.75" dur="4.2">was take the spying from the US</text>
  <text start="625.66" dur="2.82">government and moved it onto the</text>
  <text start="626.95" dur="4.05">corporation&amp;#39;s they want the corporations</text>
  <text start="628.48" dur="4.83">to spy on the people that information</text>
  <text start="631" dur="4.14">will now be transmitted over to the</text>
  <text start="633.31" dur="3.66">government so the government can say we</text>
  <text start="635.14" dur="5.55">are no longer spying on you now you can</text>
  <text start="636.97" dur="5.94">take responsibility into your own hands</text>
  <text start="640.69" dur="4.32">because if you want things to be private</text>

  <text start="759.42" dur="4.59">browser so there&amp;#39;s many different ways</text>
  <text start="760.86" dur="4.62">you can do this to protect yourself now</text>
  <text start="764.01" dur="2.61">we understand the united states</text>
  <text start="765.48" dur="4.14">government central bankers are</text>
  <text start="766.62" dur="4.14">continually trying to remove the weapons</text>
  <text start="769.62" dur="3.48">from the people and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="770.76" dur="4.89">starting with guns the UK has already</text>
  <text start="773.1" dur="6.66">have they already have a tight gun</text>
  <text start="775.65" dur="6.6">control ban on the people while they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="779.76" dur="4.83">taking it a step forward they&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="782.25" dur="6.18">the next step and now they want to ban</text>
  <text start="784.59" dur="7.22">all knives we know the US government has</text>
  <text start="788.43" dur="8.7">drawn up plans for knife regulations and</text>
  <text start="791.81" dur="10.09">in the UK it is already begun for the UK</text>
  <text start="797.13" dur="6.81">gun control is just not enough now the</text>
  <text start="801.9" dur="4.86">program involved several weeks of</text>
  <text start="803.94" dur="4.11">amnesty for pointed knives civilians can</text>
  <text start="806.76" dur="2.97">turn in these apparently dangerous</text>
  <text start="808.05" dur="3.78">weapons in their local police stations</text>
  <text start="809.73" dur="4.65">in exchange for amnesty apparently even</text>
  <text start="811.83" dur="4.35">though knives rounded or pointed aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="814.38" dur="3.33">illegal in the United Kingdom they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="816.18" dur="3.9">trying to get everyone to give in their</text>
  <text start="817.71" dur="5.61">weapons now we know why this is because</text>
  <text start="820.08" dur="6.3">when a society is closed down they have</text>
  <text start="823.32" dur="5.49">to remove the weapons from the people</text>
  <text start="826.38" dur="4.53">anyway they possibly can</text>
  <text start="828.81" dur="5.19">there is however right now a ban on</text>
  <text start="830.91" dur="6.09">people under 18 buying knives going so</text>
  <text start="834" dur="7.23">far on the absurdity scale as to Ben</text>
  <text start="837" dur="6.48">underage purchases of plastic knives so</text>
  <text start="841.23" dur="5.16">as time goes on we can see with all</text>
  <text start="843.48" dur="4.23">these draconian laws removing the rights</text>
  <text start="846.39" dur="4.05">of the people removing the weapons of</text>
  <text start="847.71" dur="5.61">the people they know something is about</text>
  <text start="850.44" dur="4.62">to occur they realize that things are</text>
  <text start="853.32" dur="3.87">going to go down when this entire system</text>
  <text start="855.06" dur="4.5">collapse collapses and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="857.19" dur="4.589">people to have weapons because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="859.56" dur="4.5">easier to control the population without</text>
  <text start="861.779" dur="4.951">weapons and to make them do things they</text>
  <text start="864.06" dur="4.469">don&amp;#39;t really want to do then if people</text>
  <text start="866.73" dur="4.32">had weapons and this is why the founding</text>
  <text start="868.529" dur="5.011">fathers in the United States here gave</text>
  <text start="871.05" dur="4.82">us the Second Amendment this is why they</text>
  <text start="873.54" dur="5.97">included it because they know eventually</text>
  <text start="875.87" dur="5.95">government&amp;#39;s become tyrannical they</text>
  <text start="879.51" dur="4.8">realize eventually and this is coming</text>
  <text start="881.82" dur="4.62">from Thomas Jefferson that the freedom</text>
  <text start="884.31" dur="4.32">they gave us once again the people are</text>
  <text start="886.44" dur="6.54">going to have to fight for do you really</text>
  <text start="888.63" dur="7.55">want freedom do you really want the</text>
  <text start="892.98" dur="6.09">government controlling you anymore</text>
  <text start="896.18" dur="4.99">dictating what you can or cannot say and</text>
  <text start="899.07" dur="4.41">they knew this they knew the time would</text>
  <text start="901.17" dur="5.1">come and they knew the system would only</text>
  <text start="903.48" dur="4.65">last a hundred years but actually it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="906.27" dur="3.45">gone on for two hundred and we can see</text>
  <text start="908.13" dur="4.97">the entire thing is starting to break</text>
  <text start="909.72" dur="8.01">down but if you look at the murder rates</text>
  <text start="913.1" dur="6.52">in the UK gun ban we can see that the</text>
  <text start="917.73" dur="4.02">murder rates according to this graph</text>
  <text start="919.62" dur="3.719">continually rise coming from the</text>
  <text start="921.75" dur="4.61">nineteen sixty eight gun control law</text>
  <text start="923.339" dur="6.201">murder rates continually moved up in</text>
  <text start="926.36" dur="6.25">1997 there was a new gun control law and</text>
  <text start="929.54" dur="6.34">murder rates continually went up it&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="932.61" dur="4.95">an upward trend because again if people</text>
  <text start="935.88" dur="5.459">do not have weapons they will resort to</text>
  <text start="937.56" dur="6.84">knives bats anything else to commit a</text>
  <text start="941.339" dur="7.891">crime the only reason they&amp;#39;re banning</text>
  <text start="944.4" dur="6.99">weapons is not to protect you it&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="949.23" dur="4.95">protect themselves they want to get rid</text>
  <text start="951.39" dur="6.569">of everything so they can control the</text>
  <text start="954.18" dur="4.89">people now out in Venezuela we</text>
  <text start="957.959" dur="2.671">understand that the United States</text>
  <text start="959.07" dur="2.64">government central bankers were trying</text>
  <text start="960.63" dur="3.27">to</text>
  <text start="961.71" dur="4.41">have a color revolution they wanted to</text>
  <text start="963.9" dur="3.69">get and remove the government there and</text>
  <text start="966.12" dur="4.89">stick in a puppet government like that</text>
  <text start="967.59" dur="5.76">doing in Ukraine Libya Yemen Lebanon</text>
  <text start="971.01" dur="4.02">they want to do it in Syria they want to</text>
  <text start="973.35" dur="4.41">do it in Iran and many other countries</text>
  <text start="975.03" dur="4.47">and we see right now that Venezuela</text>
  <text start="977.76" dur="4.38">actually is turning towards Russia and</text>
  <text start="979.5" dur="4.47">China China turned over the first batch</text>
  <text start="982.14" dur="5.73">of about five hundred and fifty seven</text>
  <text start="983.97" dur="6.81">mil 557 military vehicles to Venezuela</text>

  <text start="993.42" dur="4.74">assault breacher vehicle and other</text>
  <text start="996.06" dur="4.41">vehicles and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="998.16" dur="5.19">Venezuela has planned to buy a total of</text>
  <text start="1000.47" dur="8.51">about 2,100 military vehicles for its</text>
