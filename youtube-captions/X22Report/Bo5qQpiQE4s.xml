  <text start="148.9" dur="4.08">to show up food lines were starting to</text>
  <text start="151" dur="4.5">form because people couldn&amp;#39;t feed</text>
  <text start="152.98" dur="7.61">themselves but Europe was feeling it</text>
  <text start="155.5" dur="11.19">they were in this really deep recession</text>
  <text start="160.59" dur="8.89">depression and when they looked over at</text>
  <text start="166.69" dur="4.62">the US all they saw was how well the</text>
  <text start="169.48" dur="3.9">stock market was doing and all the</text>
  <text start="171.31" dur="5.34">reports were saying that everything was</text>
  <text start="173.38" dur="5.79">fine and we&amp;#39;re seeing the same thing</text>
  <text start="176.65" dur="5.04">happen we&amp;#39;re seeing that Europe is</text>
  <text start="179.17" dur="5.3">struggling they&amp;#39;re using countries that</text>
  <text start="181.69" dur="6.03">are in deep debt to bail out countries</text>
  <text start="184.47" dur="6.13">who already have debt so it&amp;#39;s dead upon</text>
  <text start="187.72" dur="5.25">that upon dead upon debt and you can</text>
  <text start="190.6" dur="5.91">only do this for so long and everything</text>
  <text start="192.97" dur="6.87">just completely collapses now the S&amp;amp;P</text>
  <text start="196.51" dur="10.05">just down roads Italy from triple B plus</text>
  <text start="199.84" dur="9.869">to triple B and as we can see that more</text>
  <text start="206.56" dur="5.34">and more European countries are being</text>
  <text start="209.709" dur="5.341">downgraded now you don&amp;#39;t really see that</text>
  <text start="211.9" dur="7.68">much in the u.s. we have a huge amount</text>
  <text start="215.05" dur="6.54">of debt 17 trillion or so and they</text>
  <text start="219.58" dur="4.59">changed all the calculations so it&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="221.59" dur="6.66">know they don&amp;#39;t say anything and S&amp;amp;P was</text>
  <text start="224.17" dur="8.34">sued so they could not report on the the</text>
  <text start="228.25" dur="6.959">rating of the United States Moody&amp;#39;s has</text>
  <text start="232.51" dur="6.21">been bought and paid for so they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="235.209" dur="7.951">going to do anything and some of the</text>
  <text start="238.72" dur="7.83">other rating agencies were forbidden to</text>
  <text start="243.16" dur="6.93">rate the United States and you have to</text>
  <text start="246.55" dur="6.09">remember S&amp;amp;P downgraded the US and the</text>
  <text start="250.09" dur="4.71">government central bankers the Fed were</text>
  <text start="252.64" dur="4.61">really pissed off at that time when they</text>
  <text start="254.8" dur="5.28">did this so to stop them from</text>
  <text start="257.25" dur="5.98">downgrading them again they decided to</text>
  <text start="260.08" dur="7.23">create this lawsuit against S&amp;amp;P and</text>
  <text start="263.23" dur="7.17">stopped SP in their tracks and they</text>
  <text start="267.31" dur="6.169">didn&amp;#39;t rate anything but</text>
  <text start="270.4" dur="7.5">in Europe countries are being downgraded</text>
  <text start="273.479" dur="7.75">because things are not going well over</text>
  <text start="277.9" dur="6.75">there and what&amp;#39;s funny is they</text>
  <text start="281.229" dur="5.821">downgraded Cyprus to default but when</text>
  <text start="284.65" dur="4.829">they did their bomb swap and they the</text>
  <text start="287.05" dur="5.85">bond swap and they got more debt they up</text>
  <text start="289.479" dur="6.151">them back up to Triple C and that just</text>
  <text start="292.9" dur="7.079">goes to show you you know the more debt</text>
  <text start="295.63" dur="7.56">you have the higher your rating which</text>
  <text start="299.979" dur="9.031">makes no sense now there was an article</text>
  <text start="303.19" dur="8.009">that says US dollar is screwed Toronto</text>
  <text start="309.01" dur="5.04">Switzerland to become you one currency</text>
  <text start="311.199" dur="4.53">trading hub China radio the US and</text>
  <text start="314.05" dur="6.589">Europe have always suppressed the rising</text>
  <text start="315.729" dur="4.91">price of gold and they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="321.75" dur="6.37">they&amp;#39;re talking about Switzerland will</text>
  <text start="325.87" dur="5.519">join the race to be the trading hub for</text>
  <text start="328.12" dur="5.22">China&amp;#39;s yuan Switzerland plans to a bid</text>
  <text start="331.389" dur="4.771">to become an offshore want you want</text>
  <text start="333.34" dur="4.74">trading center in Europe competing with</text>
  <text start="336.16" dur="4.56">Frankfurt and London to corner trade in</text>
  <text start="338.08" dur="5.369">the Chinese currency now why is everyone</text>
  <text start="340.72" dur="5.729">doing this why are these countries you</text>
  <text start="343.449" dur="6.931">know looking to do this because in the</text>
  <text start="346.449" dur="8.4">long run China will eventually become</text>
  <text start="350.38" dur="7.92">the world reserve currency the</text>
  <text start="354.849" dur="7.971">Bundesbank reported this China has huge</text>
  <text start="358.3" dur="8.7">amounts of gold to back up their economy</text>
  <text start="362.82" dur="7.54">and the Western banks are all fiat and</text>
  <text start="367" dur="6.599">they have little or no gold to back up</text>
  <text start="370.36" dur="6.299">their systems and Russia and China right</text>
  <text start="373.599" dur="7.951">now have huge amounts of gold to back up</text>
  <text start="376.659" dur="10.201">their systems so they&amp;#39;re looking to get</text>
  <text start="381.55" dur="9.149">in line and get on board with China at</text>
  <text start="386.86" dur="6.089">this point and I hate to say it the US</text>
  <text start="390.699" dur="4.311">and Europe they&amp;#39;ve been suppressing gold</text>
  <text start="392.949" dur="6.72">because they&amp;#39;re trying to catch up in</text>
  <text start="395.01" dur="6.7">buying gold central banks bankers all</text>
  <text start="399.669" dur="3.75">these people are trying to rush to</text>
  <text start="401.71" dur="2.4">purchase goal because they know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="403.419" dur="4.561">going to happen</text>
  <text start="404.11" dur="6.24">and what they did was let&amp;#39;s smack down</text>
  <text start="407.98" dur="4.41">the price of gold and silver and this</text>
  <text start="410.35" dur="3.6">way we can buy more but what has</text>
  <text start="412.39" dur="4.68">happened is since they&amp;#39;ve done that</text>
  <text start="413.95" dur="4.89">China comes in Russia comes in other</text>
  <text start="417.07" dur="3.6">countries come in and they start</text>
  <text start="418.84" dur="7.41">purchasing it up because it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="420.67" dur="9.33">inexpensive now let move on here Obama</text>

  <text start="430" dur="4.65">don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m pronouncing that right</text>
  <text start="431.22" dur="6.49">u.s. considers total Afghanistan pull</text>

  <text start="437.71" dur="6.6">Afghanistan pull out they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="441.73" dur="7.14">to pull out of again Afghanistan first</text>
  <text start="444.31" dur="6.45">of all they have a huge opium market</text>
  <text start="448.87" dur="4.65">where they grow poppies and the US</text>
  <text start="450.76" dur="5.84">government is involved in this where</text>

  <text start="492.58" dur="5.1">u.s. the central bankers are going to</text>
  <text start="494.98" dur="6.12">pull out when there&amp;#39;s all these natural</text>
  <text start="497.68" dur="6.27">resources and they are there and they</text>
  <text start="501.1" dur="5.37">are going to take it in the end so this</text>
  <text start="503.95" dur="5.04">is all doublespeak there is no way</text>
  <text start="506.47" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re going to do it they continue if</text>
  <text start="508.99" dur="4.59">you notice throughout the years they</text>
  <text start="511.09" dur="5.7">always say oh they&amp;#39;re going to pull out</text>
  <text start="513.58" dur="7.59">and guess what happens they never do</text>
  <text start="516.79" dur="7.1">because they want all of these natural</text>
  <text start="521.17" dur="5.9">resources the gold the lithium</text>
  <text start="523.89" dur="9.22">especially the copper China is making</text>
  <text start="527.07" dur="10.13">their case and coming in and wanting to</text>
  <text start="533.11" dur="7.75">do the mining and and get the copper</text>
  <text start="537.2" dur="11.43">from Afghanistan so the US is in no way</text>
  <text start="540.86" dur="12">going to let this happen now the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="548.63" dur="10.02">still preparing for nuclear war and I</text>
  <text start="552.86" dur="9.03">know you know back in when the the pres</text>
  <text start="558.65" dur="6.51">Obama was running you know he gave you</text>
  <text start="561.89" dur="5.7">no speeches where he stated that the US</text>
  <text start="565.16" dur="5.88">government was committed to building a</text>
  <text start="567.59" dur="12.47">nuclear weapons free world if that is</text>
  <text start="571.04" dur="12.06">the case why is the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="580.06" dur="6.31">going to their spending ten billion</text>
  <text start="583.1" dur="5.43">dollars on a makeover and the new s</text>
  <text start="586.37" dur="5.34">nuclear weapons activities including</text>
  <text start="588.53" dur="6.21">upgrading nuclear warheads like the b61</text>
  <text start="591.71" dur="7.62">gravity bomb and modernizing nuclear</text>
  <text start="594.74" dur="6.69">weapons production facilities they are</text>
  <text start="599.33" dur="6.23">proceeding with this because they know</text>
  <text start="601.43" dur="8.97">in the end and they know for a fact that</text>
  <text start="605.56" dur="9.52">eventually we will end up in a world war</text>
  <text start="610.4" dur="11.58">and most likely nuclear weapons will be</text>
  <text start="615.08" dur="10.23">used okay now Syrian government claims</text>
  <text start="621.98" dur="5.63">massive seizure of toxic chemicals</text>
  <text start="625.31" dur="5.28">controlled by anti-government forces</text>
  <text start="627.61" dur="6.97">basically the serious this serious the</text>
  <text start="630.59" dur="7.31">Syrian government confiscated a cache of</text>
  <text start="634.58" dur="9.42">toxic chemicals which were left behind</text>
  <text start="637.9" dur="9.82">by the paid mercenaries now I know there</text>
  <text start="644" dur="5.97">were reports that the u.s. the UK and</text>
  <text start="647.72" dur="3.78">France came out to say that the Syrian</text>
  <text start="649.97" dur="4.95">government was using chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="651.5" dur="5.58">but the UN did their own report and the</text>
  <text start="654.92" dur="4.74">first report said that they it was the</text>
  <text start="657.08" dur="6.75">rebels that were actually using chemical</text>
  <text start="659.66" dur="6.66">weapons and then the US and the other</text>
  <text start="663.83" dur="5.7">countries said we want a second report</text>
  <text start="666.32" dur="4.68">and the UN finally caved and said okay</text>
  <text start="669.53" dur="8.12">both sides were using it</text>
  <text start="671" dur="10.17">but in reality why would a revolution if</text>
  <text start="677.65" dur="7.81">it&amp;#39;s a true revolution and it was true</text>
  <text start="681.17" dur="7.5">Syrian people they are using chemical</text>
  <text start="685.46" dur="10.53">weapons on the Syrian people this is a</text>
  <text start="688.67" dur="9.6">fact why would Syrians use the weapons</text>
  <text start="695.99" dur="4.32">on their own people if we look back</text>
  <text start="698.27" dur="3.72">let&amp;#39;s just use the American Revolution</text>
  <text start="700.31" dur="4.17">George Washington Benjamin Franklin</text>
  <text start="701.99" dur="7.53">Thomas Jefferson would they go around</text>
  <text start="704.48" dur="9.33">using weapons on the people of the</text>
  <text start="709.52" dur="5.69">Americas at the time of the colonies no</text>
  <text start="713.81" dur="6.03">they wouldn&amp;#39;t it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="715.21" dur="8.08">they&amp;#39;re their fight is to have freedom</text>
  <text start="719.84" dur="7.02">their fight is to break away from the</text>
  <text start="723.29" dur="7.7">existing government their fight was for</text>
  <text start="726.86" dur="8.97">freedom well the Syrian revolutionists</text>
  <text start="730.99" dur="6.97">if they were truly Syrian that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="735.83" dur="5.82">they would be fighting for just like if</text>
  <text start="737.96" dur="6.09">we looked over in Egypt Egypt the people</text>
  <text start="741.65" dur="4.26">rose up and they didn&amp;#39;t use they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="744.05" dur="3.36">use chemical weapons on each other to</text>
  <text start="745.91" dur="5.7">prove their point that would be</text>
  <text start="747.41" dur="5.94">ridiculous no most of the time a true</text>
  <text start="751.61" dur="4.38">revolution because nobody wants war</text>
  <text start="753.35" dur="6">nobody in their right want right mind</text>
  <text start="755.99" dur="7.29">wants war at all the Egyptian people</text>
  <text start="759.35" dur="6.51">came out and protested peacefully they</text>
  <text start="763.28" dur="5.15">held up signs they showed their concerns</text>
  <text start="765.86" dur="7.01">they came out in the masses and</text>
  <text start="768.43" dur="8.86">supported each other to get more see out</text>
  <text start="772.87" dur="8.98">and this is what happened in the</text>
  <text start="777.29" dur="7.49">Revolutionary War not everyone but the</text>
  <text start="781.85" dur="7.02">people they supported each other they</text>
  <text start="784.78" dur="8.11">did everything they could peacefully</text>
  <text start="788.87" dur="5.91">first until the British came and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="792.89" dur="4.68">going after their weapons and they knew</text>
  <text start="794.78" dur="4.74">during the American Revolution if they</text>
  <text start="797.57" dur="4.139">got the weapons the people would be</text>
  <text start="799.52" dur="5.83">screwed and they would have no way to</text>
  <text start="801.709" dur="8.071">fight and that&amp;#39;s why that turned</text>
  <text start="805.35" dur="8.13">into a war but the Syrian Revolution</text>
  <text start="809.78" dur="6.97">didn&amp;#39;t it started out as a fighting war</text>
  <text start="813.48" dur="5.34">right in the beginning and also you</text>
  <text start="816.75" dur="6.18">would see hundreds of thousands of</text>
  <text start="818.82" dur="7.76">people in the syrian of all the Syrian</text>
  <text start="822.93" dur="7.05">people protesting against the government</text>
  <text start="826.58" dur="6.52">just like here in the US or in any</text>
  <text start="829.98" dur="6.3">country if the people get to the point</text>
  <text start="833.1" dur="7.38">where they cannot take it anymore you</text>
  <text start="836.28" dur="8.34">will see a massive rally of people</text>
  <text start="840.48" dur="9.42">getting together and wanting a real</text>
  <text start="844.62" dur="11.19">change okay let&amp;#39;s move on here now it</text>
  <text start="849.9" dur="10.89">looks like drones could be weaponized on</text>
  <text start="855.81" dur="7.89">American soil now they&amp;#39;re using they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="860.79" dur="5.55">using a non-lethal weapons like tasers</text>
  <text start="863.7" dur="8.52">and things like that but we have to</text>

  <text start="1077.01" dur="4.9">people are seeing a different side of</text>
  <text start="1079.57" dur="3.96">the story now the central bankers and</text>
  <text start="1081.91" dur="4.23">the government do not like this because</text>
  <text start="1083.53" dur="4.17">way way back in nineteen thirteen when</text>

  <text start="1093.309" dur="3.781">you have to control the money and can</text>

  <text start="1104.2" dur="8.04">executive order which supposedly which</text>
  <text start="1108.04" dur="7.5">is not really a law it&amp;#39;s a guideline to</text>
  <text start="1112.24" dur="5.67">help them with the law and I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1115.54" dur="4.139">what law there is that this helps with</text>

  <text start="1124.27" dur="6.149">completely false it&amp;#39;s supposed to</text>
  <text start="1126.61" dur="7.62">support an existing law that was voted</text>

  <text start="1134.23" dur="5.189">of is they are reading waiting for sis</text>
  <text start="1137.35" dur="4.709">but because he already had a one</text>

  <text start="1142.059" dur="6.231">is another executive order and when this</text>

  <text start="1148.29" dur="11.83">support sista and the only way you know</text>
  <text start="1156.48" dur="5.829">this is really great because when not</text>

  <text start="1399.15" dur="7.56">or more think about that so if you had</text>
  <text start="1402.84" dur="8.48">130 manual 30 round magazine you now</text>
  <text start="1406.71" dur="9.48">need three how does this weigh you down</text>

  <text start="1690.83" dur="4.47">military and well-known private</text>
  <text start="1693.2" dur="3.78">investigative network the military</text>
  <text start="1695.3" dur="3.03">source decided to come forward because</text>

  <text start="1711.68" dur="6.57">the national scout jamboree has been</text>
  <text start="1714.86" dur="5.37">moved to a different location and i put</text>
  <text start="1718.25" dur="3.75">the maps here and the explanation of</text>

  <text start="1722" dur="6.85">saying is if there is a</text>
  <text start="1724.06" dur="7.38">or terrorist attack as the government</text>

  <text start="1739.9" dur="8.12">navigate through and it looks like it it</text>
  <text start="1745.12" dur="8.49">could be a complete set up for this</text>
  <text start="1748.02" dur="8.92">biological type of drill and we are</text>
  <text start="1753.61" dur="5.73">going to see other drills coming up we</text>
