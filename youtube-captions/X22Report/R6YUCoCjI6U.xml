  <text start="177.89" dur="8.49">of all the stories and everything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="180.44" dur="9.24">going on I do believe that Obama the</text>
  <text start="186.38" dur="7.44">central banks they still are going to</text>
  <text start="189.68" dur="6.48">push and push to know to get the guns</text>
  <text start="193.82" dur="5.43">away from the people and to know who has</text>
  <text start="196.16" dur="6.87">what so they can go ahead and take the</text>
  <text start="199.25" dur="7.26">guns when they&amp;#39;re good and ready and you</text>
  <text start="203.03" dur="8.28">can see some of this in New Yorker ready</text>
  <text start="206.51" dur="7.89">where there are matching the gun permits</text>
  <text start="211.31" dur="5.91">up to medical records of people who</text>
  <text start="214.4" dur="5.58">might have mental illness or might be on</text>
  <text start="217.22" dur="5.46">some type of drug and they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="219.98" dur="4.259">the people you know please give your gun</text>
  <text start="222.68" dur="3.99">back because you&amp;#39;re not allowed to have</text>
  <text start="224.239" dur="5.25">it and don&amp;#39;t forget New York still has</text>
  <text start="226.67" dur="7.17">that law that you know if you suspect</text>
  <text start="229.489" dur="6.511">someone that having a illegal gun report</text>
  <text start="233.84" dur="5.55">them and then they&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;ll start an</text>
  <text start="236" dur="6.63">investigation and they&amp;#39;ll see if you are</text>
  <text start="239.39" dur="4.92">innocent or guilty with it without any</text>
  <text start="242.63" dur="3.66">proof there will dig up the proof for</text>
  <text start="244.31" dur="4.26">you and the person reporting it if you</text>
  <text start="246.29" dur="4.02">are guilty of having an illegal gun they</text>
  <text start="248.57" dur="4.199">will get five hundred dollars and this</text>
  <text start="250.31" dur="4.41">brings us back to back in the days of</text>
  <text start="252.769" dur="4.47">the Nazis where people were reporting on</text>
  <text start="254.72" dur="6.06">each other and getting rewarded for it</text>
  <text start="257.239" dur="6.691">and I even discussed this in my episodes</text>
  <text start="260.78" dur="6.48">with the Great Depression I even had a</text>
  <text start="263.93" dur="4.98">little part where it said Obama was</text>
  <text start="267.26" dur="4.92">giving clothes</text>
  <text start="268.91" dur="6.66">food to people who saw people talking in</text>
  <text start="272.18" dur="6">groups talking about rebelling against</text>
  <text start="275.57" dur="4.94">the government and things like that so</text>
  <text start="278.18" dur="8.13">you can see this is starting already and</text>
  <text start="280.51" dur="10.33">this is not a good sign and even people</text>
  <text start="286.31" dur="6.96">in the states where where we have the</text>
  <text start="290.84" dur="5.34">strict gun laws are the new gun laws</text>
  <text start="293.27" dur="5.88">like Colorado a sheriff is actually</text>
  <text start="296.18" dur="7.01">suing because he&amp;#39;s saying the new gun</text>
  <text start="299.15" dur="7.92">laws are unconstitutional finally</text>
  <text start="303.19" dur="6.43">someone is coming out and is looking at</text>
  <text start="307.07" dur="5.48">this and saying no you can&amp;#39;t do any of</text>
  <text start="309.62" dur="6.81">these laws these are these laws are</text>
  <text start="312.55" dur="5.74">completely unconstitutional and if you</text>
  <text start="316.43" dur="5.01">read the Second Amendment and I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="318.29" dur="7.49">to repeat myself again the word bear is</text>
  <text start="321.44" dur="7.82">to carry arms is weapons ammunition</text>
  <text start="325.78" dur="7.24">armaments armament means military-grade</text>
  <text start="329.26" dur="6.49">weapons infringe means you cannot limit</text>
  <text start="333.02" dur="8.55">you can you cannot undermine or you</text>
  <text start="335.75" dur="8.52">cannot encroach on every single law that</text>
  <text start="341.57" dur="5.91">comes out that has to do with guns is</text>
  <text start="344.27" dur="5.58">infringing is lit let&amp;#39;s put this to</text>
  <text start="347.48" dur="4.17">common sense telling you how many</text>
  <text start="349.85" dur="4.86">bullets in a magazine is that limiting</text>
  <text start="351.65" dur="7.35">of course it is telling that you have to</text>
  <text start="354.71" dur="6.75">go and get a background check or</text>
  <text start="359" dur="5.04">fingerprinted or photographed is that</text>
  <text start="361.46" dur="6.86">limiting and crouching on or undermining</text>
  <text start="364.04" dur="7.97">yes this is why our forefathers</text>
  <text start="368.32" dur="8.02">constructed this sentence in this way</text>
  <text start="372.01" dur="7.12">it&amp;#39;s simple it&amp;#39;s easy and it covers all</text>
  <text start="376.34" dur="6.77">bases now of course you can ignore it</text>
  <text start="379.13" dur="6.96">like everyone is but where are all these</text>
  <text start="383.11" dur="6.79">constitutional lawyers I mean this is</text>
  <text start="386.09" dur="9.18">not brain surgery here they put this</text>
  <text start="389.9" dur="9">together and made it really easy so we</text>
  <text start="395.27" dur="5.42">couldn&amp;#39;t f it up and we need more people</text>
  <text start="398.9" dur="4.02">like this sheriff coming out and saying</text>
  <text start="400.69" dur="5.26">these laws are</text>
  <text start="402.92" dur="4.53">sweetly unconstitutional they are</text>
  <text start="405.95" dur="7.11">completely against the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="407.45" dur="11.31">and these laws are null and void and do</text>
  <text start="413.06" dur="9.24">not represent anything now talking about</text>
  <text start="418.76" dur="6.36">the guns DHS the Department of Homeland</text>
  <text start="422.3" dur="5.79">Security you know the Obama who wanted</text>
  <text start="425.12" dur="6.84">to set up the private civilian armed</text>
  <text start="428.09" dur="9.29">forces and he wanted them to be funded</text>
  <text start="431.96" dur="10.83">just as armed as the military they are</text>
  <text start="437.38" dur="9.13">right now creating they have a contract</text>
  <text start="442.79" dur="7.91">with this company who is creating drones</text>
  <text start="446.51" dur="10.05">that can detect if you have a gun or not</text>
  <text start="450.7" dur="8.44">now I place on my website a video so you</text>
  <text start="456.56" dur="5.79">can see and what they what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="459.14" dur="7.07">talking about but you know why in the</text>
  <text start="462.35" dur="8.1">world would you need a hovering drone</text>
  <text start="466.21" dur="5.44">detecting who has what because when</text>
  <text start="470.45" dur="3.09">you&amp;#39;re in a crew I mean think about</text>
  <text start="471.65" dur="7.29">let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s think about this for a</text>
  <text start="473.54" dur="9.84">second if you are in a crowd and the</text>
  <text start="478.94" dur="6.45">drone is flying above and a pinpoint</text>
  <text start="483.38" dur="4.41">this person has a gun this person is</text>
  <text start="485.39" dur="5.49">concealed this person has a gun I mean</text>
  <text start="487.79" dur="9.42">think how much easier it is it will be</text>
  <text start="490.88" dur="9.03">for the DHS forces to go directly to</text>
  <text start="497.21" dur="5.19">those people or what happens if the</text>
  <text start="499.91" dur="4.56">drone is flying over your home this</text>
  <text start="502.4" dur="5.04">house has a gun that house has a gun</text>
  <text start="504.47" dur="5.36">this house has a gun let&amp;#39;s just think</text>
  <text start="507.44" dur="6.9">about this for a second why in the world</text>
  <text start="509.83" dur="7.32">do they need this again I said this in</text>
  <text start="514.34" dur="6.63">my previous episode when have we seen</text>
  <text start="517.15" dur="7.71">terrorists armies invade the United</text>
  <text start="520.97" dur="6.68">States terrorists usually do one-off</text>
  <text start="524.86" dur="6.34">type of things they blow up something</text>
  <text start="527.65" dur="6.01">could be a car bomb it I mean 911</text>
  <text start="531.2" dur="4.77">supposedly they flew planes in and if</text>
  <text start="533.66" dur="3.119">you really think about 911 and use</text>
  <text start="535.97" dur="3.029">common sense</text>
  <text start="536.779" dur="3.6">I got on the planes with box cutters and</text>
  <text start="538.999" dur="4.52">nobody could stop them but that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="540.379" dur="4.77">whole nother story but we&amp;#39;ve usually</text>
  <text start="543.519" dur="5.081">terrorists and we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="545.149" dur="5.341">throughout history they do one off</text>
  <text start="548.6" dur="3.69">things that they&amp;#39;re not marching into</text>
  <text start="550.49" dur="4.86">the United States with hundreds of</text>
  <text start="552.29" dur="9.69">thousands of soldiers so what does the</text>
  <text start="555.35" dur="9.5">DHS need this for only one reason they</text>
  <text start="561.98" dur="6.329">would need something like this is if</text>
  <text start="564.85" dur="6.099">militias and militias are on the rise in</text>
  <text start="568.309" dur="5.161">this country I think in my other episode</text>
  <text start="570.949" dur="6.39">there like up two hundred percent to</text>
  <text start="573.47" dur="6.719">find out which militias have guns which</text>
  <text start="577.339" dur="5.881">ones you know where are you know if</text>
  <text start="580.189" dur="5.791">militias are grouped together they can</text>
  <text start="583.22" dur="7.65">spot them in a house or anything using</text>
  <text start="585.98" dur="11.539">this type of technology okay let&amp;#39;s move</text>
  <text start="590.87" dur="9.959">on now today with this so called a</text>
  <text start="597.519" dur="5.831">missile test that the North Korea was</text>
  <text start="600.829" dur="5.041">supposed to do today which really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="603.35" dur="4.919">occur and Japan would you know fire and</text>
  <text start="605.87" dur="4.829">shoot down the missiles and my question</text>
  <text start="608.269" dur="4.11">is you know if they did fire a missile</text>
  <text start="610.699" dur="5.971">and it was within the borders of the</text>
  <text start="612.379" dur="7.58">country which it would Japan fire a</text>
  <text start="616.67" dur="6.75">missile into North Korea to shoot them</text>
  <text start="619.959" dur="4.901">their missile test I I mean think about</text>
  <text start="623.42" dur="4.109">it in the United States if we were</text>
  <text start="624.86" dur="4.8">testing a missile in you know Nevada and</text>
  <text start="627.529" dur="5.881">then we saw another missile fly in and</text>
  <text start="629.66" dur="6.119">destroy it is that an act of war or is</text>
  <text start="633.41" dur="4.279">he is with the United States be to blame</text>
  <text start="635.779" dur="4.201">where is someone else from the outside</text>
  <text start="637.689" dur="4.57">shooting something overs but this is the</text>
  <text start="639.98" dur="4.88">same thing we&amp;#39;re seeing and Japan is</text>
  <text start="642.259" dur="6.39">saying in North Korean for North Korea</text>
  <text start="644.86" dur="5.68">but I mean they continually the</text>
  <text start="648.649" dur="5.79">propaganda with North Korea in the war</text>
  <text start="650.54" dur="5.849">is continually ongoing and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="654.439" dur="5.34">continually that they haven&amp;#39;t stopped</text>
  <text start="656.389" dur="6">with it but we still and if anyone knows</text>
  <text start="659.779" dur="6.091">this and I asked it on the people and so</text>
