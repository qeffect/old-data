  <text start="56.89" dur="5.579">is November 28 2016 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="60.01" dur="5.28">episode is Jule Stynes vote recount is</text>
  <text start="62.469" dur="6.091">not a vote recount it&amp;#39;s something much</text>
  <text start="65.29" dur="5.75">worse let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="68.56" dur="7.38">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="71.04" dur="9.07">now as Obama approaches his last couple</text>
  <text start="75.94" dur="7.739">of days in office he is rushing through</text>
  <text start="80.11" dur="5.91">a final set of executive actions in his</text>
  <text start="83.679" dur="4.591">final two months here now we know that</text>
  <text start="86.02" dur="5.25">Congress they voted to block his ability</text>
  <text start="88.27" dur="5.25">to pass any new laws or policies but he</text>
  <text start="91.27" dur="4.769">is doing whatever he possibly can to get</text>
  <text start="93.52" dur="4.56">everything through at once he&amp;#39;s put</text>
  <text start="96.039" dur="5.901">pushing through new regulations on</text>
  <text start="98.08" dur="7.11">commodities speculation air pollution</text>
  <text start="101.94" dur="7.81">he&amp;#39;s pushing regulations about Medicare</text>
  <text start="105.19" dur="8.19">drug payments high-skilled immigrants in</text>
  <text start="109.75" dur="5.99">order to cement his legacy he&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="113.38" dur="5.699">worried about his legacy but of course</text>
  <text start="115.74" dur="5.949">when Trump gets into office most likely</text>
  <text start="119.079" dur="7.61">all this will be reversed at least we</text>
  <text start="121.689" dur="10.89">hope so we see that the establishment</text>
  <text start="126.689" dur="9.101">well they don&amp;#39;t want to accept that the</text>
  <text start="132.579" dur="5.97">people of the United States decided that</text>
  <text start="135.79" dur="5.34">Trump is going to be the new president</text>
  <text start="138.549" dur="5.071">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="141.13" dur="4.229">throughout the election they kept on</text>
  <text start="143.62" dur="4.739">saying to trump you know when you lose</text>
  <text start="145.359" dur="6.451">are you going to concede and take it</text>
  <text start="148.359" dur="7.111">like a man well he didn&amp;#39;t lose he won</text>
  <text start="151.81" dur="5.6">and Hillary lost and it seemed like she</text>
  <text start="155.47" dur="6.57">really didn&amp;#39;t take her own advice and</text>
  <text start="157.41" dur="9.75">then we have Jill Stein who started this</text>
  <text start="162.04" dur="8.569">entire campaign to have recounts in</text>
  <text start="167.16" dur="8.74">pennsylvania wisconsin and michigan and</text>
  <text start="170.609" dur="7.781">she started to create this campaign to</text>
  <text start="175.9" dur="4.53">have people donate now it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="178.39" dur="3.49">interesting about all this is that the</text>
  <text start="180.43" dur="4.63">donations came in very</text>
  <text start="181.88" dur="6.09">very quickly and it looks like this was</text>
  <text start="185.06" dur="4.65">not just a grassroots uprising where</text>
  <text start="187.97" dur="4.2">people are saying oh let me just donate</text>
  <text start="189.71" dur="5.1">to have these recounts done it looks</text>
  <text start="192.17" dur="5.22">like these were big donors because at</text>
  <text start="194.81" dur="4.02">one point the donations were coming in</text>
  <text start="197.39" dur="5.58">at four thousand eight hundred eighty</text>
  <text start="198.83" dur="6.6">three dollars per minute and we see</text>
  <text start="202.97" dur="5.55">right now that she&amp;#39;s trying to get</text>
  <text start="205.43" dur="6.93">Pennsylvania Michigan and Wisconsin to</text>
  <text start="208.52" dur="9.24">recount now the question is why is she</text>
  <text start="212.36" dur="7.44">doing this why is she pushing a recount</text>
  <text start="217.76" dur="4.5">vote now people are saying well even if</text>
  <text start="219.8" dur="5.16">they recount all the electorate is going</text>
  <text start="222.26" dur="4.95">to change anything what is all this</text>
  <text start="224.96" dur="7.29">about well we know the electors they</text>
  <text start="227.21" dur="7.77">meet on December nineteenth and before</text>
  <text start="232.25" dur="5.85">that time period Trump is not the</text>
  <text start="234.98" dur="6.21">president-elect just yet and we</text>
  <text start="238.1" dur="5.52">discussed this many times before we see</text>
  <text start="241.19" dur="4.08">that two states right now Michigan they</text>
  <text start="243.62" dur="3.81">just certify that Donald Trump was the</text>
  <text start="245.27" dur="6.9">winner of the state&amp;#39;s electoral votes</text>
  <text start="247.43" dur="7.86">and we see that Wisconsin denies the</text>
  <text start="252.17" dur="7.71">request for the recount to be done by</text>
  <text start="255.29" dur="6.89">hand but they will recount and we see</text>
  <text start="259.88" dur="5.48">the Wisconsin&amp;#39;s elections commissioner</text>
  <text start="262.18" dur="5.56">chairman Mark Thompson who is a Democrat</text>
  <text start="265.36" dur="4.09">announced earlier that the committee</text>
  <text start="267.74" dur="3.36">would follow through with Stein&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="269.45" dur="4.26">recount request but denied a request</text>
  <text start="271.1" dur="7.35">that the recount be conducted by hand</text>
  <text start="273.71" dur="7.32">and he also said that this recount is</text>
  <text start="278.45" dur="7.53">very unlikely to change anything that</text>
  <text start="281.03" dur="7.71">stands right now so the question is why</text>
  <text start="285.98" dur="5.3">is she pushing this so hard I mean she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="288.74" dur="6.66">raised almost seven million dollars now</text>
  <text start="291.28" dur="7.45">it keeps going up and up and up is this</text>
  <text start="295.4" dur="4.65">for personal interest no because she has</text>
  <text start="298.73" dur="3.24">less than one percent of the vote in</text>
  <text start="300.05" dur="7.5">these states and this wouldn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="301.97" dur="9.3">help her in any way well is she hoping</text>
  <text start="307.55" dur="7.2">that the recount would maybe tip it</text>
  <text start="311.27" dur="4.59">towards Hillary well multiple experts</text>
  <text start="314.75" dur="3.18">and even the hill</text>
  <text start="315.86" dur="4.2">campaign insiders have emitted that</text>
  <text start="317.93" dur="4.079">overturning election results with a</text>
  <text start="320.06" dur="4.65">margin of victory of several one as</text>
  <text start="322.009" dur="6.66">several thousand votes is kind of</text>
  <text start="324.71" dur="6.09">unlikely is she trying to expose voting</text>
  <text start="328.669" dur="6.361">machine hacking well that&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="330.8" dur="6.75">not true is she going to keep all the</text>
  <text start="335.03" dur="4.77">funds that she&amp;#39;s raised and keep the no</text>
  <text start="337.55" dur="5.609">date the donations of millions of</text>
  <text start="339.8" dur="4.679">dollars maybe but people might call her</text>
  <text start="343.159" dur="3.211">out on that I know there was fight in</text>
  <text start="344.479" dur="3.93">print saying that she might not be able</text>
  <text start="346.37" dur="6.659">to get the recount and the money will be</text>
  <text start="348.409" dur="7.801">used for other purposes so what is she</text>
  <text start="353.029" dur="6.241">really trying to do well we have to go</text>
  <text start="356.21" dur="7.199">back to the electoral college and they</text>
  <text start="359.27" dur="7.23">meet on December nineteenth now they</text>
  <text start="363.409" dur="6.361">know they can&amp;#39;t push Hillary&amp;#39;s electoral</text>
  <text start="366.5" dur="6.33">votes up past trumps they know this is</text>
  <text start="369.77" dur="5.699">not going to work but what they can do</text>
  <text start="372.83" dur="5.04">and this is according to Edward Foley</text>
  <text start="375.469" dur="5.7">who is an expert in election law at</text>
  <text start="377.87" dur="7.039">Moritz College of Law at Ohio State</text>
  <text start="381.169" dur="7.86">University while these states are</text>
  <text start="384.909" dur="8.29">recounting they are like in limbo right</text>
  <text start="389.029" dur="8.64">now and Trump will not have those</text>
  <text start="393.199" dur="7.02">electoral votes and they&amp;#39;re hoping to</text>
  <text start="397.669" dur="4.5">keep thee stand this is why she wanted</text>
  <text start="400.219" dur="4.891">the votes done by hand because it will</text>
  <text start="402.169" dur="7.201">take longer they&amp;#39;re hoping to have these</text>
  <text start="405.11" dur="8.429">votes counted past the December</text>
  <text start="409.37" dur="7.229">nineteenth date now what would that give</text>
  <text start="413.539" dur="7.35">them well that would mean that Trump</text>
  <text start="416.599" dur="10.07">only has 260 electoral votes and hilary</text>
  <text start="420.889" dur="11.84">has 232 and they can say ah nobody won</text>
  <text start="426.669" dur="8.74">no one has the 270 electoral votes and</text>
  <text start="432.729" dur="6.91">then this would be then that this would</text>
  <text start="435.409" dur="7.49">then move to Congress to decide and we</text>
  <text start="439.639" dur="7.291">know that right now that Congress is</text>
  <text start="442.899" dur="5.95">made up of Republicans the Senate and</text>
  <text start="446.93" dur="3.989">the house</text>
  <text start="448.849" dur="5.46">and most likely they would choose Trump</text>
  <text start="450.919" dur="5.27">or Pence but I think what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="454.309" dur="5.82">to try to do is say well wait a minute</text>
  <text start="456.189" dur="5.65">Hillary has the popular vote she should</text>
  <text start="460.129" dur="6.391">actually be the winner of all of this</text>
  <text start="461.839" dur="7.14">and we can see it is a stall tactic now</text>
  <text start="466.52" dur="7.56">they&amp;#39;re trying to do all of this within</text>
  <text start="468.979" dur="6.8">the law well kind of in the law and it</text>
  <text start="474.08" dur="4.849">looks like they have multiple phases</text>
  <text start="475.779" dur="6.7">leading up to when Trump is sworn in and</text>
  <text start="478.929" dur="6.64">we can see they&amp;#39;re pushing and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="482.479" dur="6.03">preparing for Phase two now this is</text>
  <text start="485.569" dur="4.5">phase one they have phase two which is</text>
  <text start="488.509" dur="4.351">in January where they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="490.069" dur="4.7">protests we&amp;#39;re most likely they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="492.86" dur="5.22">to try to break it out into riots and</text>
  <text start="494.769" dur="5.35">maybe go from there maybe have it spread</text>
  <text start="498.08" dur="5.059">across the nation we don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="500.119" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re let&amp;#39;s call them sleeper cells in</text>
  <text start="503.139" dur="7.54">different cities preparing to push</text>
  <text start="506.509" dur="9.39">riding to bring martial law into the</text>
  <text start="510.679" dur="9.571">picture and we can see right now this is</text>
  <text start="515.899" dur="6.54">their plan they&amp;#39;re not conceding they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="520.25" dur="4.41">not saying okay Trump is going to be the</text>
  <text start="522.439" dur="7.561">president it looks like they have</text>
  <text start="524.66" dur="9.359">multiple phases of trying to stop Trump</text>
  <text start="530" dur="5.61">from being the president and this is</text>
  <text start="534.019" dur="4.05">something that we need to watch because</text>
  <text start="535.61" dur="6.029">we can see they are definitely pushing</text>
  <text start="538.069" dur="6.181">their agenda we see today the corporate</text>
  <text start="541.639" dur="7.411">media was out there and they were saying</text>
  <text start="544.25" dur="8.399">there were a active shooter which was</text>
  <text start="549.05" dur="7.709">happening in Ohio that people are being</text>
  <text start="552.649" dur="10.261">shot the person is opening firing and it</text>
  <text start="556.759" dur="10.531">turns out there was no guns no one was</text>
  <text start="562.91" dur="8.039">shot the person had a butcher knife the</text>
  <text start="567.29" dur="6.719">person took their red SUV drove their</text>
  <text start="570.949" dur="6.811">SUV into a building and started to stab</text>
  <text start="574.009" dur="7.26">people now the person is a 20 year old</text>
  <text start="577.76" dur="4.95">Somali refugee they are saying that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="581.269" dur="4.171">a legal citizen</text>
  <text start="582.71" dur="5.52">and there are very conflicting news</text>
  <text start="585.44" dur="6.27">stories about his age what we see really</text>
  <text start="588.23" dur="5.73">doing there what is his motive and we</text>
  <text start="591.71" dur="5.82">see that site Intel&amp;#39;s read accounts</text>
  <text start="593.96" dur="6.81">which is a propaganda outlet she&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="597.53" dur="8.82">there tweeting like crazy that this</text>
  <text start="600.77" dur="9.39">could be the Islamic state and these</text>
  <text start="606.35" dur="7.74">attacks look consistent with the Islamic</text>
  <text start="610.16" dur="6.93">state and most likely it is the Islamic</text>
  <text start="614.09" dur="5.7">state and again with all these different</text>
  <text start="617.09" dur="5.1">things there&amp;#39;s always different agendas</text>
  <text start="619.79" dur="4.29">associated with what&amp;#39;s going on now the</text>
  <text start="622.19" dur="4.35">corporate media they wanted this to be</text>
  <text start="624.08" dur="5.43">an act of shooting they wanted to show</text>
  <text start="626.54" dur="6.18">that guns are bad but here we are with a</text>
  <text start="629.51" dur="4.89">butcher knife and what are they going to</text>
  <text start="632.72" dur="5.58">say they&amp;#39;re gonna have to outlaw butcher</text>
  <text start="634.4" dur="8.31">knives again it is not the weapon that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="638.3" dur="7.11">the problem it&amp;#39;s the person someone gets</text>
  <text start="642.71" dur="6.6">behind the wheel of a car decides to mow</text>
  <text start="645.41" dur="7.68">down 20 people it&amp;#39;s not the car it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="649.31" dur="5.61">person driving the car same thing with</text>
  <text start="653.09" dur="3.27">someone who&amp;#39;s using a knife but they</text>
  <text start="654.92" dur="4.17">don&amp;#39;t want to go with the knife because</text>
  <text start="656.36" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s not a good story for them because</text>
  <text start="659.09" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re trying to get rid of the weapons</text>
  <text start="660.29" dur="4.92">from the people but again it&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="662.6" dur="5.25">knife it&amp;#39;s not the inanimate object it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="665.21" dur="5.19">the person using it and when people</text>
  <text start="667.85" dur="5.16">think well people you know if we get rid</text>
  <text start="670.4" dur="5.16">of the weapons people won&amp;#39;t kill anymore</text>
  <text start="673.01" dur="4.41">really so throughout time when there</text>
  <text start="675.56" dur="4.64">were no such thing as guns people didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="677.42" dur="5.79">kill which is absolutely ridiculous and</text>
  <text start="680.2" dur="5.23">if we get rid of weapons and make them</text>
  <text start="683.21" dur="5.43">illegal guess what they won&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="685.43" dur="5.36">get a weapon really well drugs are</text>
  <text start="688.64" dur="4.71">illegal people can still get drugs</text>
  <text start="690.79" dur="5.14">during the Prohibition alcohol was</text>
  <text start="693.35" dur="6.18">illegal and people were able to get</text>
  <text start="695.93" dur="5.13">alcohol on the black market so whatever</text>
  <text start="699.53" dur="5.43">the government is trying to convince you</text>
  <text start="701.06" dur="7.35">of guess what it is always the opposite</text>
  <text start="704.96" dur="6.3">so we see out in the Philippines Duterte</text>
  <text start="708.41" dur="5.16">he is pulling away from the United</text>
  <text start="711.26" dur="4.26">States and we know back on november</text>
  <text start="713.57" dur="3.09">eighth birthday claimed that he was</text>
  <text start="715.52" dur="4.14">going to cancel in order</text>
  <text start="716.66" dur="5.039">6000 us made m16 rifles saying that we</text>
  <text start="719.66" dur="5.549">can get this type of hardware someplace</text>
  <text start="721.699" dur="8.13">else we can get it domestically and what</text>
  <text start="725.209" dur="7.231">he&amp;#39;s doing right now is he&amp;#39;s moving away</text>
  <text start="729.829" dur="6.24">from the United States and moving closer</text>
  <text start="732.44" dur="4.889">and closer to Russia and China and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="736.069" dur="5.181">out there saying that the Philippines</text>
  <text start="737.329" dur="7.771">are ready to buy arms from Russia and</text>
  <text start="741.25" dur="7.48">they&amp;#39;re looking to go ahead and start</text>
  <text start="745.1" dur="8.07">making purchases from Russia and even</text>
  <text start="748.73" dur="7.77">maybe China we see Ukraine is out there</text>
  <text start="753.17" dur="6.63">and they are pushing the propaganda hard</text>
  <text start="756.5" dur="5.49">we see they&amp;#39;re saying that the Russian</text>
  <text start="759.8" dur="4.649">authorities while they&amp;#39;re preparing for</text>
  <text start="761.99" dur="7.5">a large scale propagation against</text>
  <text start="764.449" dur="8.461">Ukraine and Belarus and Ukraine they are</text>
  <text start="769.49" dur="6.719">doing everything they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="772.91" dur="7.94">provoke Russia before Trump gets into</text>
  <text start="776.209" dur="8.671">office they&amp;#39;re having a missile drill</text>
  <text start="780.85" dur="6.25">over Crimea they&amp;#39;re continually using</text>
  <text start="784.88" dur="4.41">propaganda to say that Russia is</text>
  <text start="787.1" dur="5.4">building up its troops why in the world</text>
  <text start="789.29" dur="5.82">would washa do this at this point there</text>
  <text start="792.5" dur="6.319">is no reason for them to do this right</text>

  <text start="988.42" dur="8.56">Russia Syria they have the upper hand in</text>

  <text start="1000.339" dur="5.79">tactical nuke they might try to use an</text>
  <text start="1002.999" dur="5.801">event around the world and they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="1006.129" dur="4.82">pushing the idea that the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1008.8" dur="4.949">is planning attacks across Europe</text>
  <text start="1010.949" dur="4.99">because what they&amp;#39;re putting out there</text>
  <text start="1013.749" dur="3.991">is that this British general has claimed</text>
  <text start="1015.939" dur="5.64">that they found and they seized</text>
  <text start="1017.74" dur="6.209">intelligence saying that the Islamic</text>

  <text start="1031.75" dur="4.64">us-led operations against terrorist</text>
  <text start="1033.49" dur="5.969">group and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="1036.39" dur="4.899">they&amp;#39;re pushing the idea that these</text>
  <text start="1039.459" dur="4.321">events are coming now why would they do</text>
  <text start="1041.289" dur="4.8">this at this point well the first reason</text>
  <text start="1043.78" dur="4.74">is what we&amp;#39;ve been talking about this</text>
  <text start="1046.089" dur="4.891">economy is deteriorating very very</text>
  <text start="1048.52" dur="4.98">quickly this holiday season is not going</text>
  <text start="1050.98" dur="6.6">well and how do you explain away an</text>
  <text start="1053.5" dur="6.419">economy where retail is dying people are</text>
  <text start="1057.58" dur="3.63">losing their jobs people who are trying</text>
  <text start="1059.919" dur="3.39">to look for a job only can find</text>
  <text start="1061.21" dur="4.52">part-time jobs it is very difficult to</text>
  <text start="1063.309" dur="5.011">convince the world that everything is</text>
  <text start="1065.73" dur="5.189">a-okay and they know this because it as</text>
  <text start="1068.32" dur="5.55">things deteriorate quicker and quicker</text>
  <text start="1070.919" dur="5.201">it&amp;#39;s getting harder and harder for them</text>
  <text start="1073.87" dur="3.9">to explain why this is all happening now</text>
  <text start="1076.12" dur="4.35">they can only have the people look at</text>
  <text start="1077.77" dur="5.46">the stock market for so long until they</text>
  <text start="1080.47" dur="4.41">say well wait a minute the sales the</text>
  <text start="1083.23" dur="5.929">revenue from all these companies it</text>
  <text start="1084.88" dur="6.48">really makes no sense whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="1089.159" dur="4.26">something could come out of left field</text>
  <text start="1091.36" dur="4.53">that brings the entire system down and</text>
  <text start="1093.419" dur="4.931">they&amp;#39;ll have no control over which they</text>
  <text start="1095.89" dur="5.58">don&amp;#39;t want to happen they want full</text>
  <text start="1098.35" dur="7.38">control and what they really want to do</text>
  <text start="1101.47" dur="6.329">is bring us into war now hopefully we</text>
  <text start="1105.73" dur="4.71">won&amp;#39;t enter into war but they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1107.799" dur="5.551">to try to bring us into war remember</text>
  <text start="1110.44" dur="4.979">they have certain goals they want to</text>
  <text start="1113.35" dur="3.75">reduce the population they want to reset</text>
  <text start="1115.419" dur="3.241">the system</text>
  <text start="1117.1" dur="5.61">and they want to control the flow of</text>
  <text start="1118.66" dur="6.3">information and again start this whole</text>
  <text start="1122.71" dur="4.37">thing over again and maybe move remove</text>
  <text start="1124.96" dur="4.2">the people&amp;#39;s rights all at the same time</text>
  <text start="1127.08" dur="5.44">this is what they&amp;#39;ve been trying to do</text>
  <text start="1129.16" dur="7.44">for a very long time and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1132.52" dur="7.14">to bring the world under one rule that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1136.6" dur="4.77">the globalist plan and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1139.66" dur="3.81">working on this for a very very long</text>
  <text start="1141.37" dur="4.049">time and they&amp;#39;re not just going to say</text>
  <text start="1143.47" dur="4.5">you know what it didn&amp;#39;t work out well</text>
  <text start="1145.419" dur="5.101">what are you gonna do no they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1147.97" dur="4.53">to push their plan as hard as they</text>
  <text start="1150.52" dur="5.22">possibly can until they get their way</text>
  <text start="1152.5" dur="6.96">and look what they&amp;#39;ve done in the past</text>
  <text start="1155.74" dur="5.25">with 911 with the other events that you</text>
  <text start="1159.46" dur="7.67">see throughout Europe and the United</text>
  <text start="1160.99" dur="8.429">States well these were small events</text>
  <text start="1167.13" dur="4.929">they&amp;#39;re going to push this to the next</text>
  <text start="1169.419" dur="6.421">level because we&amp;#39;re at the end game here</text>
  <text start="1172.059" dur="7.471">they&amp;#39;re becoming desperate desperate</text>
  <text start="1175.84" dur="8.67">people do really horrific things and</text>
  <text start="1179.53" dur="8.91">they don&amp;#39;t care who they hurt so what</text>
  <text start="1184.51" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a push to</text>
  <text start="1188.44" dur="4.53">reach their goal and these people are</text>
  <text start="1189.85" dur="5.309">very goal-oriented we&amp;#39;ve been reporting</text>
  <text start="1192.97" dur="4.439">on this for a very long time they have</text>
  <text start="1195.159" dur="4.861">not given up getting into Syria I mean</text>
  <text start="1197.409" dur="4.89">go back to 2013 when they said all we</text>
  <text start="1200.02" dur="5.399">want is sorta sod to have no chemical</text>
  <text start="1202.299" dur="6.921">weapons that was a complete lie they</text>
