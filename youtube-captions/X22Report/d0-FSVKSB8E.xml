  <text start="313.16" dur="5.41">this is why they&amp;#39;re pushing so hard and</text>
  <text start="316.98" dur="4.8">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all of</text>
  <text start="318.57" dur="6.96">this is there&amp;#39;s one thing that this</text>
  <text start="321.78" dur="6.9">shows us is that the establishment those</text>
  <text start="325.53" dur="6.99">individuals in government they do not</text>
  <text start="328.68" dur="9.33">listen to the people they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="332.52" dur="6.36">following the people&amp;#39;s instructions what</text>
  <text start="338.01" dur="4.14">does that tell you</text>
  <text start="338.88" dur="7.59">it tells you they&amp;#39;re really not working</text>
  <text start="342.15" dur="7.83">for the people it exposes who they</text>
  <text start="346.47" dur="6.3">really are now here in the US Trump is</text>
  <text start="349.98" dur="5.31">now tweeting out how strong the economy</text>
  <text start="352.77" dur="6.27">is this is about controlling the</text>
  <text start="355.29" dur="5.67">economic narrative yes we all know that</text>
  <text start="359.04" dur="4.02">the economic indicators show a recession</text>
  <text start="360.96" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;ve been showing a recession for a</text>
  <text start="363.06" dur="5.43">very long time if I go back to the Obama</text>
  <text start="366.57" dur="4.53">administration the economic indicators</text>
  <text start="368.49" dur="6.35">have shown us we were in a recession</text>
  <text start="371.1" dur="8.85">we&amp;#39;re still in a recession but remember</text>
  <text start="374.84" dur="10.66">the magic wand allows whoever is in</text>
  <text start="379.95" dur="9.75">control to hide the recession think</text>
  <text start="385.5" dur="7.38">about how powerful the central bank is</text>
  <text start="389.7" dur="7.49">when they completely control the</text>
  <text start="392.88" dur="7.8">economic system through stimulus through</text>
  <text start="397.19" dur="6.82">interest rates and the manipulation of</text>
  <text start="400.68" dur="7.62">the statistical numbers Trump is using</text>
  <text start="404.01" dur="5.79">this to his advantage even though the</text>
  <text start="408.3" dur="3.09">mainstream media is out there and</text>
  <text start="409.8" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re talking about a recession and</text>
  <text start="411.39" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re saying that indicators are</text>
  <text start="413.13" dur="3.87">showing that we&amp;#39;re headed towards a</text>
  <text start="414.93" dur="4.68">recession we have Elizabeth Warren out</text>
  <text start="417" dur="5.13">there and she&amp;#39;s saying that a stock</text>
  <text start="419.61" dur="5.64">market correction is coming much sooner</text>
  <text start="422.13" dur="5.16">than you think now of course she must be</text>
  <text start="425.25" dur="4.68">she she is most likely being</text>
  <text start="427.29" dur="6.21">this information from certain</text>
  <text start="429.93" dur="4.71">individuals that think because the</text>
  <text start="433.5" dur="3.15">mainstream media has been pushing</text>
  <text start="434.64" dur="5.25">recession that there&amp;#39;s going to be this</text>
  <text start="436.65" dur="7.89">major correction which is going to lead</text>
  <text start="439.89" dur="8.1">to a recession but again who&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="444.54" dur="7.73">control of all of this Trump and the</text>
  <text start="447.99" dur="7.53">Patriots remember what happened in</text>
  <text start="452.27" dur="7.96">2008-2009 and then again in 2010 and</text>

  <text start="490.56" dur="5.97">has been doing it for a very long time</text>
  <text start="492.29" dur="7.57">Trump understands this and he realizes</text>
  <text start="496.53" dur="5.43">that he needs the Fed to cut the</text>
  <text start="499.86" dur="4.83">interest rate way down remember they</text>
  <text start="501.96" dur="6.15">were raising them he needs them to come</text>

  <text start="599.29" dur="5.97">short period of time and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="602.26" dur="5.82">continually pushing the globalists</text>

  <text start="647.47" dur="6.93">that wealth gap that was created by the</text>
  <text start="650.86" dur="6.48">central bank and the deep state now</text>
  <text start="654.4" dur="6.48">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the Fed</text>
  <text start="657.34" dur="5.999">is already projecting and preparing for</text>
  <text start="660.88" dur="5.459">what is coming because they already know</text>
  <text start="663.339" dur="5.971">that the mainstream media is going to</text>
  <text start="666.339" dur="5.491">hit the Fed and Trump very hard saying</text>
  <text start="669.31" dur="6.18">that Trump forced the Fed to cut rates</text>
  <text start="671.83" dur="6.78">again Trump forced the Fed to start</text>
  <text start="675.49" dur="3.96">stimulus and the Fed is supposed to be</text>
  <text start="678.61" dur="3.979">independent</text>
  <text start="679.45" dur="6.62">now remember optics are very important</text>
  <text start="682.589" dur="7.661">Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell</text>
  <text start="686.07" dur="7.34">pushback against Trump and his pressure</text>
  <text start="690.25" dur="6.849">to aggressively slash interest rates</text>
  <text start="693.41" dur="5.189">starting stimulus and saying listen we</text>
  <text start="697.099" dur="4.8">don&amp;#39;t take orders from you</text>
  <text start="698.599" dur="7.13">we are completely independent and he</text>
  <text start="701.899" dur="8.4">went back in time to a former chairman</text>
  <text start="705.729" dur="8.65">that headed the Fed back in 1934 to 1948</text>
  <text start="710.299" dur="7.35">and this Chairman back then said that</text>
  <text start="714.379" dur="6.62">the Fed needs to be independent</text>
  <text start="717.649" dur="5.73">now think about why he is doing this I</text>
  <text start="720.999" dur="5.26">said it a little while ago the</text>
  <text start="723.379" dur="5.04">mainstream media the deep state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="726.259" dur="3.2">out there saying listen the Fed has to</text>
  <text start="728.419" dur="5.82">be independent</text>
  <text start="729.459" dur="9.34">Trump can&amp;#39;t politicize the Fed so Powell</text>
  <text start="734.239" dur="6.96">a head of the Fed fund rate cut ahead of</text>
  <text start="738.799" dur="6.72">the stimulus is letting everyone know</text>
  <text start="741.199" dur="7.2">and he is stressing that the Fed is free</text>
  <text start="745.519" dur="4.23">to do whatever they want if they want to</text>
  <text start="748.399" dur="3.09">lower rates that has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="749.749" dur="4.08">Trump that they want to raise rates it</text>
  <text start="751.489" dur="7.41">has nothing to do with Trump this is</text>
  <text start="753.829" dur="7.95">being done on purpose so this way nobody</text>
  <text start="758.899" dur="5.49">can point Trump or the Fed and say that</text>
  <text start="761.779" dur="5.1">Trump is controlling the Fed but guess</text>
  <text start="764.389" dur="5.28">what the Fed is going to do they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="766.879" dur="6.45">going to lower their rates again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="769.669" dur="5.84">going to start stimulus and this is when</text>
  <text start="773.329" dur="5.85">we see everything completely changed</text>
  <text start="775.509" dur="6.82">Trump is just waiting for the Fed to get</text>
  <text start="779.179" dur="6.06">to that sweet spot where the rates are</text>
  <text start="782.329" dur="6.63">low enough and stimulus get started</text>
  <text start="785.239" dur="5.91">because once this happens everything is</text>
  <text start="788.959" dur="5.4">going to change now is this going to</text>
  <text start="791.149" dur="5.04">make the economy all better is it going</text>
  <text start="794.359" dur="6.09">to fix everything that&amp;#39;s been happening</text>
  <text start="796.189" dur="7.13">now all this is is a drug to the</text>
  <text start="800.449" dur="5.46">economic system to keep it pumped up</text>
  <text start="803.319" dur="5.91">long enough for Trump to get reelected</text>
  <text start="805.909" dur="6.36">in 2020 that&amp;#39;s all he needs</text>
  <text start="809.229" dur="5.5">after this the whole system can come</text>
  <text start="812.269" dur="5.4">down which it will this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="814.729" dur="6">preparing for now of course there are</text>
  <text start="817.669" dur="5.34">those who want this to come down way</text>
  <text start="820.729" dur="5.91">before that because if the economy</text>
  <text start="823.009" dur="4.711">implodes on itself it&amp;#39;ll be a very</text>
  <text start="826.639" dur="3.841">difficult</text>
  <text start="827.72" dur="5.46">for Trump to get reelected he can&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="830.48" dur="4.5">everyone is better off because people</text>
  <text start="833.18" dur="3.72">are gonna be saying hey I lost my job</text>
  <text start="834.98" dur="4.89">hey I lost my money in the stock market</text>
  <text start="836.9" dur="7.74">hey what happened to my pension this is</text>
  <text start="839.87" dur="6.99">why Trump is pushing the Fed to lower</text>
  <text start="844.64" dur="5.55">interest rates and start stimulus he</text>
  <text start="846.86" dur="6.96">needs to hit a certain point and once he</text>
  <text start="850.19" dur="5.7">does this all of a sudden everything</text>
  <text start="853.82" dur="4.86">changes remember the Fed was raising</text>
  <text start="855.89" dur="5.03">rates they held it steady to the mid</text>
  <text start="858.68" dur="4.95">year of 2019 then they started lowering</text>
  <text start="860.92" dur="5.53">quarter-point quarter point I think once</text>
  <text start="863.63" dur="4.77">we get down another point we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="866.45" dur="3.99">see things completely change and I think</text>
