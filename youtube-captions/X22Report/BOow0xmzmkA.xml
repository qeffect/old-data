  <text start="103.57" dur="5.22">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="106.33" dur="4.38">as we can see the economy well it really</text>
  <text start="108.79" dur="3.6">has not improved at all even though</text>
  <text start="110.71" dur="3.51">Trump is out there and I understand this</text>
  <text start="112.39" dur="4.589">he&amp;#39;s out there telling everyone that</text>
  <text start="114.22" dur="4.11">jobs are coming back he is pumping up</text>
  <text start="116.979" dur="3.511">the stock market look how good</text>
  <text start="118.33" dur="4.11">everything is and we need to remember</text>
  <text start="120.49" dur="4.439">that this is part of the plan because</text>
  <text start="122.44" dur="5.489">the only tools he has is to use what the</text>
  <text start="124.929" dur="5.791">central bankers have to use what has</text>
  <text start="127.929" dur="5.401">been used all along to basically pop</text>
  <text start="130.72" dur="6.66">these bubbles he needs to push the</text>
  <text start="133.33" dur="6.36">agenda to create a circumstance where</text>
  <text start="137.38" dur="4.95">the economy comes down under their</text>
  <text start="139.69" dur="4.95">system and then turn around and blame</text>
  <text start="142.33" dur="4.83">them now I do believe that this is part</text>
  <text start="144.64" dur="4.14">of the plan and this is why we see</text>
  <text start="147.16" dur="3.54">things happening the way they are</text>
  <text start="148.78" dur="4.05">happening now we know that the stock</text>
  <text start="150.7" dur="4.23">market has nothing to do with Trump we</text>
  <text start="152.83" dur="4.47">know that all these jobs they can&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="154.93" dur="4.7">back to the United States right now the</text>
  <text start="157.3" dur="4.83">United States is actually losing jobs</text>
  <text start="159.63" dur="4.03">Manufacturing&amp;#39;s manufacturers are not</text>
  <text start="162.13" dur="3.54">coming back to the United States right</text>
  <text start="163.66" dur="4.23">now it makes no sense for them to come</text>
  <text start="165.67" dur="5.52">back to the United States because of the</text>
  <text start="167.89" dur="6.53">tax laws the regulations and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="171.19" dur="5.49">cheaper labor overseas so why would</text>
  <text start="174.42" dur="4.39">manufacturing come back to the US right</text>
  <text start="176.68" dur="5.699">now now remember when they were pushing</text>
  <text start="178.81" dur="4.77">forward the TPP and the TTIP what they</text>
  <text start="182.379" dur="3.511">were going to do is they were going to</text>
  <text start="183.58" dur="3.98">bring foreign workers to the United</text>
  <text start="185.89" dur="4.56">States and pay them</text>
  <text start="187.56" dur="4.509">what they were going to be uh making in</text>
  <text start="190.45" dur="3.119">those countries here in the United</text>
  <text start="192.069" dur="4.651">States so they would be getting paid</text>
  <text start="193.569" dur="5.671">their wages from their country which</text>
  <text start="196.72" dur="3.989">would then put out most of the American</text>
  <text start="199.24" dur="3.329">workers because the American worker</text>
  <text start="200.709" dur="4.291">wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to compete and they</text>
  <text start="202.569" dur="3.901">would bring down the cost of living here</text>
  <text start="205" dur="2.76">in the United States and make the United</text>
  <text start="206.47" dur="2.97">States a third-world country because</text>
  <text start="207.76" dur="3.99">this is where we were headed</text>
  <text start="209.44" dur="4.32">now since the TPP has gone absolutely</text>
  <text start="211.75" dur="4.86">nowhere it&amp;#39;s dead in the water what</text>
  <text start="213.76" dur="6">needs to be done right now everything</text>
  <text start="216.61" dur="5.849">needs to be changed the system cannot</text>
  <text start="219.76" dur="5.4">operate the way it is right now we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="222.459" dur="5.701">have real trade with most of the world</text>
  <text start="225.16" dur="6.9">we use dollars at because with a reserve</text>
  <text start="228.16" dur="7.2">currency of the world to control nations</text>
  <text start="232.06" dur="7.17">to force nations to give that to give us</text>
  <text start="235.36" dur="7.95">their goods while in return they get</text>
  <text start="239.23" dur="6.539">dollars and this system is coming to an</text>
  <text start="243.31" dur="6.03">end this is why Trump is out there and</text>
  <text start="245.769" dur="6.961">he&amp;#39;s saying that trade is so important</text>
  <text start="249.34" dur="5.929">and we can see right now that as the</text>
  <text start="252.73" dur="5.55">economy deteriorates and falls apart</text>
  <text start="255.269" dur="5.47">well it&amp;#39;s going to be very very</text>
  <text start="258.28" dur="4.47">important later on now out in Canada</text>
  <text start="260.739" dur="5.661">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about home capital</text>
  <text start="262.75" dur="5.97">group and their entire business is</text>
  <text start="266.4" dur="4.12">completely falling apart actually Canada</text>
  <text start="268.72" dur="4.86">is saying that they haven&amp;#39;t seen a bank</text>
  <text start="270.52" dur="4.35">run such as this in decades and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="273.58" dur="4.26">looking at it and we know there&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="274.87" dur="6.78">95% of all retail deposits they have</text>
  <text start="277.84" dur="6.21">left the business and we can see the</text>
  <text start="281.65" dur="5.13">company now is struggling so right now</text>
  <text start="284.05" dur="5.73">it looks like that they might be getting</text>
  <text start="286.78" dur="4.62">some type of bailout because Canada is</text>
  <text start="289.78" dur="3.96">looking at the situation and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="291.4" dur="4.56">want this to spread even though under</text>
  <text start="293.74" dur="3.42">the covers it&amp;#39;s already spreading it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="295.96" dur="3.15">almost like Bear Stearns</text>
  <text start="297.16" dur="2.91">and AIG and the rest of the companies</text>
  <text start="299.11" dur="2.79">where they said oh no this is an</text>
  <text start="300.07" dur="3.63">isolated incident don&amp;#39;t worry about this</text>
  <text start="301.9" dur="5.07">one&amp;#39;s an isolated incident no they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="303.7" dur="5.15">all connected and sooner or later the</text>
  <text start="306.97" dur="4.62">whole thing is just going to be a</text>
  <text start="308.85" dur="5.97">complete mess it&amp;#39;s going to implode on</text>
  <text start="311.59" dur="5.13">itself we&amp;#39;re also seeing auto loans and</text>
  <text start="314.82" dur="3.099">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about the auto</text>
  <text start="316.72" dur="3.98">industry for a very long time we</text>
  <text start="317.919" dur="4.281">understand how they channel stuffed</text>
  <text start="320.7" dur="4.32">dealerships where they continually</text>
  <text start="322.2" dur="4.89">produce cars and then of course when</text>
  <text start="325.02" dur="5.01">they channel stuff the dealership lots</text>
  <text start="327.09" dur="5.1">those are counted as sales and then the</text>
  <text start="330.03" dur="3.3">dealerships have a lot of cars and then</text>
  <text start="332.19" dur="3.06">the manufacturers have to offer</text>
  <text start="333.33" dur="5.19">incentives to move those cars off a lot</text>
  <text start="335.25" dur="5.7">so they can bring more cars in but to do</text>
  <text start="338.52" dur="4.5">this they needed a way to allow</text>
  <text start="340.95" dur="3.93">individuals with really bad credit to</text>
  <text start="343.02" dur="3.54">come in and purchase these cars and this</text>
  <text start="344.88" dur="3.54">is why they kept on reducing the</text>
  <text start="346.56" dur="4.05">requirements for those individuals to</text>
  <text start="348.42" dur="4.56">come in and purchase these cars and what</text>
  <text start="350.61" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the backlash</text>
  <text start="352.98" dur="5.34">to all of this we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="355.59" dur="6.27">delinquencies right now they are surging</text>
  <text start="358.32" dur="5.13">like crazy they&amp;#39;re at the highest point</text>
  <text start="361.86" dur="5.91">actually we&amp;#39;re almost to the point where</text>
  <text start="363.45" dur="7.62">we were back in 2008-2009 that&amp;#39;s how bad</text>
  <text start="367.77" dur="5.94">it has gotten and as we move forward we</text>
  <text start="371.07" dur="7.02">can see that things are just going to</text>
  <text start="373.71" dur="6.63">get worse now ironically lenders well</text>
  <text start="378.09" dur="5.34">they haven&amp;#39;t pulled back at all they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="380.34" dur="5.55">actually accelerating how much they are</text>
  <text start="383.43" dur="4.59">lending out for automobiles because what</text>
  <text start="385.89" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="388.02" dur="6.06">subprime deals they have increased from</text>
  <text start="390.3" dur="6.27">five point one percent back from 2010</text>
  <text start="394.08" dur="6.69">all the way up to thirty two point five</text>
  <text start="396.57" dur="5.22">percent and this whole thing is going to</text>
  <text start="400.77" dur="4.44">be a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="401.79" dur="7.59">morgan stanley reveal that 60 plus state</text>
  <text start="405.21" dur="7.38">delinquencies at 266 subprime auto abs</text>
  <text start="409.38" dur="5.7">deals were surging despite low</text>
  <text start="412.59" dur="5.61">unemployment again something that</text>
  <text start="415.08" dur="4.95">doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense we have low</text>
  <text start="418.2" dur="4.44">unemployment actually the Fed assailing</text>
  <text start="420.03" dur="4.62">work at full employment and where the</text>
  <text start="422.64" dur="4.26">economy is working above its potential</text>
  <text start="424.65" dur="4.26">right now but again we see strange</text>
  <text start="426.9" dur="5.33">things happening we see retail stores</text>
  <text start="428.91" dur="7.05">closing with low unemployment we see the</text>
  <text start="432.23" dur="5.59">delinquency rate in auto loans rising</text>
  <text start="435.96" dur="4.8">like there&amp;#39;s no tomorrow with low</text>
  <text start="437.82" dur="5.52">unemployment which tells us something</text>
  <text start="440.76" dur="3.93">again is off and we know what&amp;#39;s off</text>
  <text start="443.34" dur="3.87">these unemployment numbers are</text>
  <text start="444.69" dur="4.92">completely fake phony and false now</text>
  <text start="447.21" dur="3.57">what&amp;#39;s happening here is the automakers</text>
  <text start="449.61" dur="4.29">they have flooded the market with</text>
  <text start="450.78" dur="6.33">automobiles and they were just too</text>
  <text start="453.9" dur="5.34">any autos that are out on the market</text>
  <text start="457.11" dur="5.36">right now and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="459.24" dur="6.72">now is that there is an estimated around</text>
  <text start="462.47" dur="6.64">2012 million low mileage vehicles that</text>
  <text start="465.96" dur="4.32">are coming off leases and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="469.11" dur="3.149">hit the market which is going to make</text>
  <text start="470.28" dur="4.979">used-car prices continually full and</text>
  <text start="472.259" dur="5.91">we&amp;#39;re seeing used-car prices falling</text>
  <text start="475.259" dur="4.141">just like we did back in 2008 and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="478.169" dur="3.361">very interesting about all of this is</text>
  <text start="479.4" dur="4.65">that we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of the same</text>
  <text start="481.53" dur="5.55">similarities that happened back in 2008</text>
  <text start="484.05" dur="5.22">and remember nothing has been fixed</text>
  <text start="487.08" dur="4.05">since that time all the central banks</text>
  <text start="489.27" dur="5.25">have done all the US government is done</text>
  <text start="491.13" dur="5.49">has covered up what happened back in</text>
  <text start="494.52" dur="4.86">2008 and they kept covering it up</text>
  <text start="496.62" dur="5.37">covering it up until here we are in 2017</text>
  <text start="499.38" dur="5.46">where things are so out of whack right</text>
  <text start="501.99" dur="4.799">now where things are so bad but no one</text>
  <text start="504.84" dur="4.53">really notices because they&amp;#39;re keeping</text>
  <text start="506.789" dur="5.011">the illusion alive and they want to keep</text>
  <text start="509.37" dur="4.169">it alive until the system comes down and</text>
  <text start="511.8" dur="3.6">like I said there&amp;#39;s a battle of who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="513.539" dur="4.5">going to bring the system down now we</text>
  <text start="515.4" dur="4.71">know that trade well trade is very</text>
  <text start="518.039" dur="4.141">important for the United States and</text>
  <text start="520.11" dur="4.77">Trump continually mentions trade he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="522.18" dur="4.409">saying yes trade is very important we</text>
  <text start="524.88" dur="3.99">need trade and the reason why he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="526.589" dur="5.551">saying this is because this is exactly</text>
  <text start="528.87" dur="5.31">what we&amp;#39;re going to need once the u.s.</text>
  <text start="532.14" dur="5.069">is no longer the reserve currency of the</text>
  <text start="534.18" dur="5.34">world we will need to establish trade</text>
  <text start="537.209" dur="4.801">now remember the globalists they had a</text>
  <text start="539.52" dur="5.04">completely different plan they wanted</text>
  <text start="542.01" dur="4.53">the TPP because they wanted the system</text>
  <text start="544.56" dur="3.57">to continually operate the way they</text>
  <text start="546.54" dur="3.12">wanted it to operate and they knew the</text>
  <text start="548.13" dur="2.94">United States was never going to bring</text>
  <text start="549.66" dur="4.44">back manufacturing under their system</text>
  <text start="551.07" dur="4.709">they knew that the way the system was it</text>
  <text start="554.1" dur="3.56">was going to completely fall apart and</text>
  <text start="555.779" dur="5.731">break apart and collapse eventually</text>
  <text start="557.66" dur="6.15">which we knew that after every 40 45</text>
  <text start="561.51" dur="5.25">years the current fayette system</text>
  <text start="563.81" dur="4.21">normally breaks down and this is what</text>
  <text start="566.76" dur="2.49">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and they knew</text>
  <text start="568.02" dur="3.81">this was going to happen and this is why</text>
  <text start="569.25" dur="4.62">they wanted the TPP in place because</text>
  <text start="571.83" dur="3.42">this way they knew that the United</text>
  <text start="573.87" dur="2.67">States was going to become a third world</text>
  <text start="575.25" dur="3.029">country this is why they were bringing</text>
  <text start="576.54" dur="3.66">in all the illegal immigrants this is</text>
  <text start="578.279" dur="3.361">why they wanted the TPP to bring in</text>
  <text start="580.2" dur="3.03">other people from other places to</text>
  <text start="581.64" dur="3.449">manufacturer here yeah they were going</text>
  <text start="583.23" dur="3.69">to bring back manufacturing but not the</text>
  <text start="585.089" dur="2.941">way you thought it was going to be it</text>
  <text start="586.92" dur="3">was going to be with</text>
  <text start="588.03" dur="4.8">those individuals from other countries</text>
  <text start="589.92" dur="4.41">making income from their countries here</text>
  <text start="592.83" dur="4.2">in the United States which would compete</text>
  <text start="594.33" dur="3.99">with the everyday worker here and the</text>
  <text start="597.03" dur="3.63">everyday worker would not be able to</text>
  <text start="598.32" dur="7.17">compete and we would have to lower our</text>
  <text start="600.66" dur="7.8">way of life now remember their idea of</text>
  <text start="605.49" dur="5.22">trade their idea of the way it should be</text>
  <text start="608.46" dur="4.74">is completely different than what Trump</text>
  <text start="610.71" dur="5.04">wants to do now McCain is out there he</text>
  <text start="613.2" dur="5.34">does not agree with Trump whatsoever</text>
  <text start="615.75" dur="5.01">he does not want any type of trade deal</text>
  <text start="618.54" dur="5.97">that goes against the globalist because</text>
  <text start="620.76" dur="5.61">he understands that if Trump establishes</text>
  <text start="624.51" dur="4.26">these trade deals and the system</text>
  <text start="626.37" dur="5.34">collapses it&amp;#39;s not going to be the way</text>
  <text start="628.77" dur="4.77">the globalists wanted where they are in</text>
  <text start="631.71" dur="4.23">control where the United States is a</text>
  <text start="633.54" dur="4.56">third world country what Trump is trying</text>
  <text start="635.94" dur="3.27">to do is he&amp;#39;s trying to establish trade</text>
  <text start="638.1" dur="3">because eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="639.21" dur="3.84">happen is that we will be able to use</text>
  <text start="641.1" dur="3.81">the dollars anymore where Pete where</text>
  <text start="643.05" dur="4.05">countries are going to be giving their</text>
  <text start="644.91" dur="4.32">products to us as we give them dollars</text>
  <text start="647.1" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;re going to have to trade oh we have</text>
  <text start="649.23" dur="4.32">grain you give us something and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="651.3" dur="5.039">how it&amp;#39;s going to have to work yes we do</text>
  <text start="653.55" dur="4.74">have that right now but not on a grand</text>
  <text start="656.339" dur="4.681">scale of the way we&amp;#39;re going to need it</text>
  <text start="658.29" dur="5.4">when the whole thing comes down now</text>
  <text start="661.02" dur="5.67">Trump&amp;#39;s appointed manufacturing czar</text>
  <text start="663.69" dur="7.95">well he is supporting NAFTA now this is</text>
  <text start="666.69" dur="7.05">GE CEO Jeff Immelt and he sits on</text>
  <text start="671.64" dur="5.52">Trump&amp;#39;s appointed manufacturing Council</text>
  <text start="673.74" dur="5.43">and he is all for NAFTA and we can see</text>
  <text start="677.16" dur="4.679">right now that Trump right now he is</text>
  <text start="679.17" dur="5.76">getting ready to we need renegotiate</text>
  <text start="681.839" dur="5.431">NAFTA and if the negotiations don&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="684.93" dur="5.01">the way he wants well he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="687.27" dur="4.35">scrap it now he&amp;#39;s negotiating because a</text>
  <text start="689.94" dur="3.93">lot of laws are intertwined into</text>
  <text start="691.62" dur="5.19">Congress and Congress would have to get</text>
  <text start="693.87" dur="4.38">involved in in removing NAFTA completely</text>
  <text start="696.81" dur="3.029">and that&amp;#39;s going to be very very</text>
  <text start="698.25" dur="4.5">difficult this point in time because the</text>
  <text start="699.839" dur="4.471">globalist they are still in charge so we</text>
  <text start="702.75" dur="3.06">can see right now that this is going to</text>
  <text start="704.31" dur="3.75">be a battle and I don&amp;#39;t know if this</text>
  <text start="705.81" dur="5.88">individual Jeff Immelt</text>
  <text start="708.06" dur="5.64">is going to last as the Trump appointed</text>
  <text start="711.69" dur="3.6">manufacturing Council because we can see</text>
  <text start="713.7" dur="3.15">right now he&amp;#39;s not on the same page</text>
  <text start="715.29" dur="3.98">whatsoever actually I&amp;#39;m going to see</text>
  <text start="716.85" dur="5.13">we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot of individuals</text>
  <text start="719.27" dur="6.73">within the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="721.98" dur="6.99">likely be removed as time goes on now</text>
  <text start="726" dur="4.77">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that states</text>
  <text start="728.97" dur="3.93">have been preparing we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="730.77" dur="5.4">about this for a while where they have</text>
  <text start="732.9" dur="5.7">brought up these bills to end income</text>
  <text start="736.17" dur="5.19">taxation on gold silver to make gold and</text>
  <text start="738.6" dur="4.56">silver sound money to set up certain</text>
  <text start="741.36" dur="4.02">areas where you can store gold and</text>
  <text start="743.16" dur="6.03">silver and we can see out in Arizona</text>
  <text start="745.38" dur="6.33">well the Senate voted 16 to 13 to remove</text>
  <text start="749.19" dur="5.31">all income taxation on precious metals</text>
  <text start="751.71" dur="5.52">at the state level now under the House</text>
  <text start="754.5" dur="6.69">bill 2014 introduced by representative</text>
  <text start="757.23" dur="6.42">mark kitchen Arizona taxpayers will</text>
  <text start="761.19" dur="5.22">simply back out all precious metal gains</text>
  <text start="763.65" dur="4.77">and losses reported on their federal tax</text>
  <text start="766.41" dur="4.62">returns from the calculation on their</text>
  <text start="768.42" dur="5.97">Arizona adjusted gross income now Ron</text>
  <text start="771.03" dur="5.49">Paul noted that HB 2014 is a very</text>
  <text start="774.39" dur="3.99">important and timely piece of</text>
  <text start="776.52" dur="3.9">legislation the Federal Reserve&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="778.38" dur="4.17">failure to reignite the economy with</text>
  <text start="780.42" dur="4.92">record low interest since the last crash</text>
  <text start="782.55" dur="4.89">is a sign that we may soon see that</text>
  <text start="785.34" dur="5.88">dollars collapse it is therefore</text>
  <text start="787.44" dur="6.03">imperative the law protect people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="791.22" dur="3.78">right to use alternatives to what may</text>
  <text start="793.47" dur="4.53">soon be virtually worthless Federal</text>
  <text start="795" dur="4.95">Reserve notes we ought not to tax money</text>
  <text start="798" dur="5.16">and that&amp;#39;s a good idea he says it makes</text>
  <text start="799.95" dur="5.85">no sense to tax money paper is not money</text>
  <text start="803.16" dur="5.49">it&amp;#39;s a substitute for money and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="805.8" dur="4.71">fraud and what he means by that is is</text>
  <text start="808.65" dur="4.62">that he&amp;#39;s referring to the fractional</text>
  <text start="810.51" dur="5.13">reserve banking practices by the Federal</text>
  <text start="813.27" dur="6.87">Reserve and other central banks now as a</text>
  <text start="815.64" dur="8.97">reminder in 1813 Thomas Jefferson warned</text>
  <text start="820.14" dur="6.63">paper money is liable to be abused has</text>
  <text start="824.61" dur="5.01">been is and forever</text>
  <text start="826.77" dur="5.43">will be abused in every country in which</text>
  <text start="829.62" dur="4.71">it is permitted this is also why the men</text>
  <text start="832.2" dur="5.82">who drafted the Constitution and powered</text>
  <text start="834.33" dur="6.03">Congress to mint gold and silver and we</text>
  <text start="838.02" dur="5.76">can see right now that as the economy</text>
  <text start="840.36" dur="6.03">falls apart as the u.s. eventually loses</text>
  <text start="843.78" dur="4.71">the reserve currency of the world as the</text>
  <text start="846.39" dur="4.41">dollar then is devalued and their new</text>
  <text start="848.49" dur="5.19">currency is born most likely backed by</text>
  <text start="850.8" dur="4.76">gold silver we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="853.68" dur="5">the system</text>
  <text start="855.56" dur="4.98">don&amp;#39;t to radically change and we can see</text>
  <text start="858.68" dur="3.81">that there are states getting prepared</text>
  <text start="860.54" dur="3.239">for this we also see that many</text>
  <text start="862.49" dur="3.57">individuals are looking towards</text>
  <text start="863.779" dur="4.711">cryptocurrency many individuals are</text>
  <text start="866.06" dur="5.37">still purchasing gold and silver</text>
  <text start="868.49" dur="4.74">countries like China and Russia India</text>
  <text start="871.43" dur="4.32">and many other countries they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="873.23" dur="5.16">buying gold and silver for a very long</text>
  <text start="875.75" dur="6.029">time and we can see why because they</text>
  <text start="878.39" dur="4.889">understand that the dollar well time is</text>
  <text start="881.779" dur="3.81">running out and they know eventually</text>
  <text start="883.279" dur="4.201">it&amp;#39;s going to fail this is why China is</text>
  <text start="885.589" dur="3.841">creating the Silk Road this is why the</text>
  <text start="887.48" dur="4.17">United States is looking at the Silk</text>
  <text start="889.43" dur="5.01">Road and looking to join the Silk Road</text>
  <text start="891.65" dur="4.77">now the globalist they do not want to</text>
  <text start="894.44" dur="3.6">join the Silk Road actually we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="896.42" dur="3.51">through the Obama administration they</text>
  <text start="898.04" dur="4.65">wanted to have nothing to do with this</text>
  <text start="899.93" dur="5.43">they had their TPP it was going against</text>
  <text start="902.69" dur="5.399">the Silk Road they didn&amp;#39;t want to join</text>
  <text start="905.36" dur="4.979">that at all Trump right now is looking</text>
  <text start="908.089" dur="3.721">at it and saying listen we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="910.339" dur="4.081">need this trade when the system comes</text>
  <text start="911.81" dur="3.93">down we&amp;#39;re going to need to trade with</text>
  <text start="914.42" dur="3.75">other countries we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="915.74" dur="4.8">be part of this we feel already that</text>
  <text start="918.17" dur="5.49">many countries have already jumped on</text>
  <text start="920.54" dur="5.76">board with the Silk Road and we can see</text>
  <text start="923.66" dur="4.05">that this is going to be huge and for</text>
  <text start="926.3" dur="3.84">the United States not to be a part of</text>
  <text start="927.71" dur="4.71">this this is going to be a huge problem</text>
  <text start="930.14" dur="5.31">so what we see coming right now is a</text>
  <text start="932.42" dur="5.4">complete collapse of the system we see</text>
  <text start="935.45" dur="5.19">that Trump right now is preparing the</text>
  <text start="937.82" dur="4.92">economy to weather this storm now the</text>
  <text start="940.64" dur="3.6">storm is going to be fierce it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="942.74" dur="4.32">going to be easy for many individuals</text>
  <text start="944.24" dur="5.67">and I like I said before you need to be</text>
