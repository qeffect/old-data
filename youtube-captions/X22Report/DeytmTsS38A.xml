  <text start="60.87" dur="3.869">going to de-escalate as soon as it was</text>
  <text start="62.609" dur="5.131">over they decided to start up the</text>
  <text start="64.739" dur="5.011">anti-terrorism forces and intensify what</text>
  <text start="67.74" dur="7.08">they were doing they even tried a false</text>

  <text start="74.82" dur="5.13">Russian pro-russian people inside the</text>

  <text start="79.95" dur="4.44">Russia into doing something and Russia</text>
  <text start="82.079" dur="4.351">just condemned what they did in that</text>
  <text start="84.39" dur="5.25">area so that false flag did not work</text>
  <text start="86.43" dur="5.46">people died for it but they couldn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="89.64" dur="4.89">any traction and they couldn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="91.89" dur="4.769">anything to happen at that point they</text>
  <text start="94.53" dur="5.339">are continuing with the anti-terrorism</text>

  <text start="117.18" dur="4.14">understand that there are paid</text>
  <text start="118.649" dur="5.58">mercenaries being filtered into Ukraine</text>
  <text start="121.32" dur="4.979">with other groups like Blackwater and we</text>
  <text start="124.229" dur="5.821">can see that they&amp;#39;re using these forces</text>
  <text start="126.299" dur="5.941">to push these small false flag events in</text>
  <text start="130.05" dur="4.44">the country trying to get Russia to do</text>
  <text start="132.24" dur="4.529">something at this point while we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="134.49" dur="3.96">watching Ukraine things have been</text>
  <text start="136.769" dur="4.231">happening in the middle east but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="138.45" dur="4.14">kind of downplayed no one&amp;#39;s really talk</text>
  <text start="141" dur="4.83">about it you see little blurbs coming</text>
  <text start="142.59" dur="6.33">out I mention it and we see in Iraq we</text>
  <text start="145.83" dur="5.67">see in Yemen we see in Libya the people</text>
  <text start="148.92" dur="5.01">are rising up there now especially in</text>
  <text start="151.5" dur="5.46">Syria what&amp;#39;s been happening is weapons</text>
  <text start="153.93" dur="5.46">have been filtering in to Syria from the</text>
  <text start="156.96" dur="4.41">United States anti-aircraft anti-tank</text>
  <text start="159.39" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;ve been in the process of training</text>
  <text start="161.37" dur="6.839">many many forces to go into Syria and it</text>
  <text start="164.64" dur="5.67">looks like as of right now that Assad</text>
  <text start="168.209" dur="4.981">has been winning the rebels have been</text>
  <text start="170.31" dur="5.67">retreating and of course the government</text>
  <text start="173.19" dur="5.58">came out and they said we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="175.98" dur="5.46">treat the opposition as the government</text>
  <text start="178.77" dur="3.78">of Syria at this point and you can see</text>
  <text start="181.44" dur="3.69">from everything that&amp;#39;s been happening</text>
  <text start="182.55" dur="5.46">all these little things they&amp;#39;re not done</text>
  <text start="185.13" dur="6.12">as a coincidence they&amp;#39;re done on purpose</text>
  <text start="188.01" dur="5.19">as a plan and they&amp;#39;re building on it</text>
  <text start="191.25" dur="4.83">every single day because something</text>
  <text start="193.2" dur="4.47">really big is about to happen in this</text>
  <text start="196.08" dur="3.93">area and we&amp;#39;re going to get into that a</text>
  <text start="197.67" dur="3.75">little bit more later in this report but</text>
  <text start="200.01" dur="4.32">let&amp;#39;s get started with the economic</text>
  <text start="201.42" dur="5.849">collapse news and Greece we understand</text>
  <text start="204.33" dur="5.55">their unemployment is horrific but what</text>
  <text start="207.269" dur="4.981">I find very interesting is that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="209.88" dur="3.78">starting to manipulate the numbers just</text>
  <text start="212.25" dur="3.15">like they do in United States they go</text>
  <text start="213.66" dur="4.41">back to revise it they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="215.4" dur="5.55">unemployment is falling look it&amp;#39;s better</text>
  <text start="218.07" dur="4.62">and when I&amp;#39;ve been seeing here is that</text>
  <text start="220.95" dur="3.18">back in January they told us the</text>
  <text start="222.69" dur="3.87">unemployment rate was about twenty six</text>
  <text start="224.13" dur="4.56">point seven percent now they went back</text>
  <text start="226.56" dur="4.769">and they revised its twenty seven point</text>
  <text start="228.69" dur="4.53">two percent and this month they lowered</text>
  <text start="231.329" dur="3.781">it to twenty six point seven percent and</text>
  <text start="233.22" dur="3.57">now they&amp;#39;re all out there going oh my</text>
  <text start="235.11" dur="4.53">god unemployment is getting better in</text>
  <text start="236.79" dur="5.009">Greece it just dropped down but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="239.64" dur="4.409">revising the numbers there each time</text>
  <text start="241.799" dur="3.931">they&amp;#39;re faking it to make it look better</text>
  <text start="244.049" dur="3.951">for this month for that for the current</text>
  <text start="245.73" dur="4.89">month and they&amp;#39;re continually doing this</text>
  <text start="248" dur="7.69">unemployment is absolutely terrible they</text>
  <text start="250.62" dur="7.95">can say it&amp;#39;s 26.7 or 27.2 it is getting</text>
  <text start="255.69" dur="5.19">closer and closer to thirty percent the</text>
  <text start="258.57" dur="3.78">youth unemployment is around fifty six</text>
  <text start="260.88" dur="4.92">point eight percent this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="262.35" dur="5.879">reporting and this is completely awful</text>
  <text start="265.8" dur="4.89">this is not getting better and they can</text>
  <text start="268.229" dur="6.3">they can you know move their centage is</text>
  <text start="270.69" dur="5.249">between no 1.1 the 1.2 up or down</text>
  <text start="274.529" dur="4.61">it makes no difference at this point</text>
  <text start="275.939" dur="7.47">yeah they&amp;#39;re uh people are unemployed</text>
  <text start="279.139" dur="6.49">it&amp;#39;s going to get worse they have no way</text>
  <text start="283.409" dur="6">of getting out of this they are too much</text>
  <text start="285.629" dur="6.84">into debt people have no jobs how are</text>
  <text start="289.409" dur="5.88">they going to spur job growth they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="292.469" dur="4.29">do it and this is their problem and this</text>
  <text start="295.289" dur="3.3">is why they&amp;#39;re playing with the numbers</text>
  <text start="296.759" dur="4.11">like this now because this is all they</text>
  <text start="298.589" dur="5.25">got they have nothing else just like the</text>
  <text start="300.869" dur="5.07">United States now here in the United</text>
  <text start="303.839" dur="4.29">States they&amp;#39;re saying that the initial</text>
  <text start="305.939" dur="4.32">claims have dropped and at this point</text>
  <text start="308.129" dur="4.74">does anyone really believe them anymore</text>
  <text start="310.259" dur="3.99">about the unemployment numbers and how</text>
  <text start="312.869" dur="3.36">many people are actually claiming</text>
  <text start="314.249" dur="4.23">unemployment because we have to remember</text>
  <text start="316.229" dur="4.8">the long-term unemployment was</text>
  <text start="318.479" dur="4.29">completely cut off all those people fell</text>
  <text start="321.029" dur="4.05">off and they&amp;#39;re not counted anymore and</text>
  <text start="322.769" dur="4.62">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is each</text>
  <text start="325.079" dur="3.87">month they tell us it&amp;#39;s you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="327.389" dur="3.48">less people applying for unemployment</text>
  <text start="328.949" dur="3.78">there&amp;#39;s more people and then they</text>
  <text start="330.869" dur="2.91">manipulate the numbers anyway anyway</text>
  <text start="332.729" dur="3.09">they want and they bring the</text>
  <text start="333.779" dur="3.45">unemployment numbers down so really at</text>
  <text start="335.819" dur="3.93">this point makes no difference</text>
  <text start="337.229" dur="5.01">whatsoever but what we are actually</text>
  <text start="339.749" dur="4.92">seeing is they&amp;#39;re getting to the point</text>
  <text start="342.239" dur="4.98">where all their numbers are starting</text>
  <text start="344.669" dur="4.35">really not to make sense anymore because</text>
  <text start="347.219" dur="3.75">every time they tell us something and</text>
  <text start="349.019" dur="4.83">they tell us the story about how</text>
  <text start="350.969" dur="4.53">unemployment is going lower things just</text>
  <text start="353.849" dur="4.89">don&amp;#39;t make sense in each one of the</text>
  <text start="355.499" dur="5.82">states and it&amp;#39;s getting worse and worse</text>
  <text start="358.739" dur="4.5">as time goes on here and what this says</text>
  <text start="361.319" dur="3.96">is the highest insured unemployment</text>
  <text start="363.239" dur="4.8">rates in the weekend in April nineteenth</text>

  <text start="375.389" dur="5.73">seeing layoffs and I said there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="378.299" dur="6.39">to be a lot more layoffs coming and here</text>
  <text start="381.119" dur="6.59">we go barclays their total layoffs is</text>
  <text start="384.689" dur="8.13">going to be about 19,000 people over</text>
  <text start="387.709" dur="8.38">this year 2015 and 2016 so they&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="392.819" dur="5.1">constant layoff pattern and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="396.089" dur="4.89">to see this from every single financial</text>
  <text start="397.919" dur="4.62">institution more and more going to come</text>

  <text start="410.569" dur="5.16">estimates for so it is not getting</text>
  <text start="413.509" dur="5.011">better it is actually getting worse and</text>
  <text start="415.729" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s going to be very very difficult for</text>
  <text start="418.52" dur="3.69">people to find work especially in this</text>

  <text start="1739.789" dur="6.851">actions russia says sanctions not</text>
  <text start="1742.8" dur="7.08">our method so what is their method well</text>
  <text start="1746.64" dur="6.63">we kind of know what it is it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="1749.88" dur="7.08">the destruction of the dollar they</text>

  <text start="2077.88" dur="7.41">really out of control coming in a very</text>
  <text start="2081.72" dur="6.84">short period of time at this time and we</text>
  <text start="2085.29" dur="4.77">can see that Syria right now only has</text>
  <text start="2088.56" dur="2.82">about eight percent of their chemical</text>
  <text start="2090.06" dur="3.57">weapons that they need to remove</text>

  <text start="2093.63" dur="4.83">what they can&amp;#39;t remove them how</text>
  <text start="2096.21" dur="6">interesting we also have to keep in mind</text>
  <text start="2098.46" dur="6.48">of the chemical and biological weapons</text>
  <text start="2102.21" dur="5.91">that they&amp;#39;re trying to convince everyone</text>

  <text start="2116.19" dur="5.13">using the propaganda that Assad has done</text>
  <text start="2118.71" dur="5.01">something like 60 chemical attacks with</text>

  <text start="2125.43" dur="3.72">which makes no sense whatsoever and I</text>
  <text start="2127.23" dur="4.05">discussed this many times what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2129.15" dur="3.81">happening right now the head of the</text>

  <text start="2167.08" dur="6.66">chemicals that they can&amp;#39;t get to this is</text>
  <text start="2170.56" dur="6.03">a setup they are planning to do</text>
  <text start="2173.74" dur="5.88">something at this time there is no doubt</text>
  <text start="2176.59" dur="6.27">about it whatsoever because all of these</text>
  <text start="2179.62" dur="5.28">indicators are showing us that something</text>

  <text start="2280.84" dur="5.82">building and building upon all of this</text>
  <text start="2283.42" dur="5.52">because we need to understand that the</text>
  <text start="2286.66" dur="5.04">economic collapse is comming this whole</text>
  <text start="2288.94" dur="4.02">entire system cannot be sustained and</text>

  <text start="2315.22" dur="4.68">the rights of the people and one last</text>
  <text start="2317.83" dur="5.31">thing I like to mention is that come</text>

  <text start="2330.88" dur="5.76">can see that might occur there might be</text>
  <text start="2333.61" dur="5.04">agent provocateurs within the crowd and</text>
  <text start="2336.64" dur="3.6">they might try to start something</text>
