  <text start="87.99" dur="5.879">news now for a very long time we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="90.659" dur="5.401">talking about how the central bank&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="93.869" dur="5.311">deep state how they&amp;#39;ve been pumping up</text>
  <text start="96.06" dur="5.31">this entire economy what they did was</text>
  <text start="99.18" dur="4.38">they created this illusion and they did</text>
  <text start="101.37" dur="5.46">this right after the financial crisis of</text>
  <text start="103.56" dur="5.43">2008 this is why the Fed went crazy they</text>
  <text start="106.83" dur="4.29">printed a lot of money transferred a lot</text>
  <text start="108.99" dur="4.35">of their currency overseas to many</text>
  <text start="111.12" dur="6.96">different banks propped up the banking</text>
  <text start="113.34" dur="7.319">system and they did a lot of underhanded</text>
  <text start="118.08" dur="5.219">things and they&amp;#39;re pretending like</text>
  <text start="120.659" dur="6.32">they&amp;#39;ve done nothing wrong and what they</text>
  <text start="123.299" dur="7.55">did was they created a gigantic</text>
  <text start="126.979" dur="7.471">illusionary economy how did they do this</text>
  <text start="130.849" dur="7.961">they needed to control a stock market</text>
  <text start="134.45" dur="6.34">precious metals real estate and they</text>
  <text start="138.81" dur="4.38">needed the government to work with them</text>
  <text start="140.79" dur="4.83">and manipulate all the statistical</text>
  <text start="143.19" dur="5.07">numbers so during this period what they</text>
  <text start="145.62" dur="4.83">did was they changed calculations they</text>
  <text start="148.26" dur="5.07">manipulated the numbers unemployment</text>
  <text start="150.45" dur="4.649">those people that are no longer looking</text>
  <text start="153.33" dur="3.689">for a job what that really means is they</text>
  <text start="155.099" dur="4.981">haven&amp;#39;t gone in on an interview in four</text>
  <text start="157.019" dur="5.311">weeks we just won&amp;#39;t count them GDP</text>
  <text start="160.08" dur="3.63">numbers well let&amp;#39;s go back to 1929</text>
  <text start="162.33" dur="3.78">recalculate it</text>
  <text start="163.71" dur="3.6">and put research and development into it</text>
  <text start="166.11" dur="1.89">recalculated all the way up to the</text>
  <text start="167.31" dur="3.27">present day</text>
  <text start="168" dur="5.13">and that will be the new GDP numbers and</text>
  <text start="170.58" dur="5.93">they did this with many different things</text>
  <text start="173.13" dur="7.11">they just kept adjusting everything why</text>
  <text start="176.51" dur="5.8">because they knew that time was going to</text>
  <text start="180.24" dur="4.14">come when they were going to have to</text>
  <text start="182.31" dur="3.72">switch out of the system because it was</text>
  <text start="184.38" dur="5.07">going to collapse now remember the</text>
  <text start="186.03" dur="5.85">central bank they never wanted to look</text>
  <text start="189.45" dur="4.44">like it is their fault because how do</text>
  <text start="191.88" dur="3.63">you start a new system if everyone is</text>
  <text start="193.89" dur="3.63">blaming them it&amp;#39;s completely impossible</text>
  <text start="195.51" dur="4.28">so they always had to make it look like</text>
  <text start="197.52" dur="4.8">they were doing a fantastic job and</text>
  <text start="199.79" dur="5.44">these are the other reasons why the</text>
  <text start="202.32" dur="5.46">economy failed and once the economy</text>
  <text start="205.23" dur="4.92">started to collapse they were going to</text>
  <text start="207.78" dur="3.75">blame this on of course a war this would</text>
  <text start="210.15" dur="4.08">cover up pretty much everything think</text>
  <text start="211.53" dur="5.61">about what it war does it makes everyone</text>
  <text start="214.23" dur="4.71">sacrifice it explains away why you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="217.14" dur="5.4">get materials on the shore on the store</text>
  <text start="218.94" dur="7.14">shelves it explains a lot everything has</text>
  <text start="222.54" dur="7.58">changed since Trump came into office we</text>
  <text start="226.08" dur="8.28">are now witnessing the destruction of</text>
  <text start="230.12" dur="7.9">the central bank system this is what it</text>
  <text start="234.36" dur="5.52">looks like without an event what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="238.02" dur="5.1">experiencing right now with the stock</text>
  <text start="239.88" dur="5.91">market with the mainstream media with</text>
  <text start="243.12" dur="6.02">everything else is what happens when</text>
  <text start="245.79" dur="6.06">their system starts to implode on itself</text>
  <text start="249.14" dur="4.12">now of course they&amp;#39;re trying to point</text>
  <text start="251.85" dur="3.36">the finger still at Trump with his</text>
  <text start="253.26" dur="4.11">tariffs and everything else but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="255.21" dur="4.86">not the reason this is why we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="257.37" dur="5.88">following the economy for such a long</text>
  <text start="260.07" dur="4.59">time it wasn&amp;#39;t to predict when it was</text>
  <text start="263.25" dur="2.16">going to happen when the collapse was</text>
  <text start="264.66" dur="2.79">going to happen</text>
  <text start="265.41" dur="3.75">it wasn&amp;#39;t gonna we weren&amp;#39;t there to say</text>
  <text start="267.45" dur="3.9">oh look it&amp;#39;s gonna happen on this day</text>
  <text start="269.16" dur="4.86">the stock market&amp;#39;s gonna come down this</text>
  <text start="271.35" dur="6.03">was about gathering all the information</text>
  <text start="274.02" dur="6.78">over a long period of time to show</text>
  <text start="277.38" dur="6.15">exactly what they have done in the past</text>
  <text start="280.8" dur="5.19">so when we&amp;#39;re here today it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="283.53" dur="4.53">surprise we know exactly what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="285.99" dur="5.94">done think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="288.06" dur="6.33">we talked about Auto Sales and we went</text>
  <text start="291.93" dur="4.87">back many many years on this where we</text>
  <text start="294.39" dur="4.779">talked about channel stuffing where the</text>
  <text start="296.8" dur="4.519">automobile dealers they would take their</text>
  <text start="299.169" dur="5.15">cars and they would channel stuff Lots</text>
  <text start="301.319" dur="5.831">they would count that as a sale so</text>
  <text start="304.319" dur="5.081">everyone thought automobile sales were</text>
  <text start="307.15" dur="3.84">doing fantastically and then they would</text>
  <text start="309.4" dur="4.32">give incentives to try to move the cars</text>
  <text start="310.99" dur="6.989">off the lot it also made manufacturing</text>
  <text start="313.72" dur="8.129">look fantastic well those days are over</text>
  <text start="317.979" dur="7.081">and what do the automobile industry what</text>
  <text start="321.849" dur="6.931">do they have to do to cover up their</text>
  <text start="325.06" dur="5.639">declining sales well they have to make</text>
  <text start="328.78" dur="4.859">an excuse and tell you well we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="330.699" dur="7.351">gonna be reporting monthly sales anymore</text>
  <text start="333.639" dur="8.881">guess who started this GM guess who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="338.05" dur="8.94">doing it now Ford Ford says they will no</text>
  <text start="342.52" dur="7.769">longer put out monthly sales anymore now</text>
  <text start="346.99" dur="6.209">remember Ford reported its sales for</text>
  <text start="350.289" dur="5.28">December and they were down 9% and if we</text>
  <text start="353.199" dur="6.511">look at Ford&amp;#39;s fleet sales and car sales</text>
  <text start="355.569" dur="7.791">they both created falling well into the</text>
  <text start="359.71" dur="8.699">double digits or negative 19.5% and</text>
  <text start="363.36" dur="8.919">negative 27.8% SUV sales they&amp;#39;re down</text>
  <text start="368.409" dur="7.681">negative 4% truck down negative 3.8 and</text>
  <text start="372.279" dur="7.351">it goes on and on and on so they decided</text>
  <text start="376.09" dur="6.479">just like GM we&amp;#39;re no longer going to</text>
  <text start="379.63" dur="6.48">report on monthly sales they know</text>
  <text start="382.569" dur="7.41">exactly what is happening we see the</text>
  <text start="386.11" dur="7.2">labor market it is just trying to stay</text>
  <text start="389.979" dur="4.981">afloat here we&amp;#39;re seeing layoffs all</text>
  <text start="393.31" dur="3.599">over the place I know the unemployment</text>
  <text start="394.96" dur="3.66">number is at three point eight percent</text>
  <text start="396.909" dur="2.79">three point seven percent three point</text>
  <text start="398.62" dur="3.18">whatever it is it doesn&amp;#39;t make a</text>
  <text start="399.699" dur="4.5">difference it&amp;#39;s a made-up number we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="401.8" dur="5.79">been following that for many many years</text>
  <text start="404.199" dur="5.911">we&amp;#39;ve explained a way on how the</text>
  <text start="407.59" dur="4.949">government continually manipulates the</text>
  <text start="410.11" dur="5.119">numbers now remember Trump is using all</text>
  <text start="412.539" dur="6.901">of these weapons to his advantage</text>
  <text start="415.229" dur="6.671">because he knows the economy was never</text>
  <text start="419.44" dur="5.37">going to last so he made it look like</text>
  <text start="421.9" dur="4.53">the economy&amp;#39;s doing fantastically this</text>
  <text start="424.81" dur="3.81">way it keeps the mainstream media and</text>
  <text start="426.43" dur="3.87">the rest away from him because what are</text>
  <text start="428.62" dur="3.87">they gonna do they&amp;#39;re gonna say hey look</text>
  <text start="430.3" dur="4.619">you manipulated everything all you do is</text>
  <text start="432.49" dur="3.959">point the finger at Obama Bush Clinton</text>
  <text start="434.919" dur="4.171">and the rest and say they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="436.449" dur="4.881">manipulating for this entire time then</text>
  <text start="439.09" dur="5.549">because I&amp;#39;m following their calculations</text>
  <text start="441.33" dur="7.66">now we&amp;#39;ve been following challenger gray</text>
  <text start="444.639" dur="5.971">and Christmas and we see something</text>
  <text start="448.99" dur="4.649">completely different now</text>
  <text start="450.61" dur="4.92">challengers job report found that seven</text>
  <text start="453.639" dur="4.321">of 28 industries tracked by challenger</text>
  <text start="455.53" dur="6.72">had 3,000 or more layoffs in December</text>
  <text start="457.96" dur="8.28">the most since April 2015 the December</text>
  <text start="462.25" dur="7.169">2018 layoff total was about 43,000 884</text>
  <text start="466.24" dur="5.69">was nearly 29 percent higher than last</text>
  <text start="469.419" dur="6.78">year and the highest since 2015</text>
  <text start="471.93" dur="7.9">additionally in 2018 538 thousand jobs</text>
  <text start="476.199" dur="5.641">were cut twenty eight point six percent</text>
  <text start="479.83" dur="4.95">higher than the four hundred and</text>
  <text start="481.84" dur="5.25">eighteen thousand announced in 2017 this</text>
  <text start="484.78" dur="4.289">is the highest annual total since five</text>
  <text start="487.09" dur="4.77">hundred ninety eight thousand cuts were</text>
  <text start="489.069" dur="4.621">recorded in 2015 and the second highest</text>
  <text start="491.86" dur="4.35">total since 2011 which was around six</text>
  <text start="493.69" dur="5.009">hundred and six thousand even more</text>
  <text start="496.21" dur="3.959">troubling is that the number of layoffs</text>
  <text start="498.699" dur="4.291">incan in the construction industry</text>
  <text start="500.169" dur="5.49">jumped by eight thousand eight hundred</text>
  <text start="502.99" dur="4.649">twenty two and this was not only more</text>
  <text start="505.659" dur="6.301">than all fifteen prior months combined</text>
  <text start="507.639" dur="6.69">but it was the most since October 2006</text>
  <text start="511.96" dur="5.939">when challenger started tracking the</text>
  <text start="514.329" dur="5.88">industry now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="517.899" dur="4.56">the mainstream media would like us to</text>
  <text start="520.209" dur="6.351">believe that trumps tariffs they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="522.459" dur="9.181">hurting the job industry but Challenger</text>
  <text start="526.56" dur="10.24">only tracked around 798 jobs that were</text>
  <text start="531.64" dur="8.37">cut specifically due to tariffs hmm what</text>
  <text start="536.8" dur="6.17">does that tell you the tariffs really</text>
  <text start="540.01" dur="5.79">have no effect on what is happening here</text>
  <text start="542.97" dur="4.45">the tariffs were put into place for</text>
  <text start="545.8" dur="3.96">something completely different which</text>
  <text start="547.42" dur="4.109">we&amp;#39;re going to go into what is happening</text>
  <text start="549.76" dur="4.47">here is we&amp;#39;re watching the total</text>
  <text start="551.529" dur="6.571">destruction of the central bank system</text>
  <text start="554.23" dur="7.59">do you see what is happening here you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="558.1" dur="5.669">witnessing the entire implosion of a</text>
  <text start="561.82" dur="4.859">central bank system in</text>
  <text start="563.769" dur="5.281">time and there&amp;#39;s nothing the central</text>
  <text start="566.679" dur="3.361">bank can do right now they were hoping</text>
  <text start="569.05" dur="4.439">they were gonna have a completely</text>
  <text start="570.04" dur="6.539">different plan but now it&amp;#39;s out in the</text>
  <text start="573.489" dur="4.5">open do you think Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="576.579" dur="3.961">wanted it this way</text>
  <text start="577.989" dur="6.06">do you think they wanted all of this to</text>
  <text start="580.54" dur="5.25">be seen out in the open so we can point</text>
  <text start="584.049" dur="3.66">the finger at who is responsible for</text>
  <text start="585.79" dur="3.839">this why do you think Trump has been</text>
  <text start="587.709" dur="4.651">contradicting the Fed why do you think</text>
  <text start="589.629" dur="4.8">he continually says listen I made the</text>
  <text start="592.36" dur="4.11">economy great look at unemployment look</text>
  <text start="594.429" dur="3.69">at GDP look at a stock market every time</text>
  <text start="596.47" dur="4.679">the Fed raises the rates what happens</text>
  <text start="598.119" dur="5.101">everything starts to fall apart look at</text>
  <text start="601.149" dur="3.511">manufacturing right now we wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="603.22" dur="4.049">reporting her manufacturing has been</text>
  <text start="604.66" dur="4.529">declining for a very long time yes Trump</text>
  <text start="607.269" dur="4.74">is trying to bring back the jobs he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="609.189" dur="5.01">only had two years to do this can he do</text>
  <text start="612.009" dur="4.77">this when the within a two year span no</text>
  <text start="614.199" dur="4.74">but he can give companies reassurances</text>
  <text start="616.779" dur="5.4">that things are going to change once we</text>
  <text start="618.939" dur="5.34">go through a transition and this is</text>
  <text start="622.179" dur="3.72">exactly what is going to happen but</text>
  <text start="624.279" dur="3.451">we&amp;#39;re seeing manufacturing this is</text>
  <text start="625.899" dur="5.13">declining I mean look at Apple for</text>
  <text start="627.73" dur="6.69">instance Apple shares they plunge by 37</text>
  <text start="631.029" dur="6.381">percent in three months we see China</text>
  <text start="634.42" dur="5.699">their economy is deteriorating</text>
  <text start="637.41" dur="5.619">everything is going to fall apart all at</text>
  <text start="640.119" dur="5.13">once why because global growth is</text>
  <text start="643.029" dur="4.77">slowing who&amp;#39;s responsible for that</text>
  <text start="645.249" dur="5.161">the central bank how did they make this</text>
  <text start="647.799" dur="4.38">possible because of the debt load as you</text>
  <text start="650.41" dur="4.799">continually add more and more debt guess</text>
  <text start="652.179" dur="6.57">what it slows growth there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="655.209" dur="7.55">around this so again we&amp;#39;re watching this</text>
  <text start="658.749" dur="6.21">happen in real time now Kevin Hassett</text>

  <text start="689.139" dur="4.271">on them</text>
  <text start="691.1" dur="4.74">Trump was out there today and he tweeted</text>
  <text start="693.41" dur="4.23">out the following United States Treasury</text>
  <text start="695.84" dur="4.14">has taken in many billions of dollars</text>
  <text start="697.64" dur="3.84">from the tariffs we are charging China</text>
  <text start="699.98" dur="4.02">and other countries that have not</text>
  <text start="701.48" dur="4.62">treated us fairly in the meantime we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="704" dur="4.59">doing well in various trade negotiations</text>
  <text start="706.1" dur="7.35">currently going on at some point this</text>
  <text start="708.59" dur="7.86">had to be done yes the tariffs were put</text>
  <text start="713.45" dur="6.03">into place for certain reasons one to</text>
  <text start="716.45" dur="6.18">bring in money to keep the country the</text>
  <text start="719.48" dur="6.3">economy operational - to even the</text>
  <text start="722.63" dur="4.95">playing field throughout the world and</text>
  <text start="725.78" dur="2.94">especially with China because you have</text>
  <text start="727.58" dur="4.05">to remember how this whole thing was</text>
  <text start="728.72" dur="6.15">created we were in a globalist system so</text>
  <text start="731.63" dur="8.04">everything had to be reversed the other</text>
  <text start="734.87" dur="8.45">reason was to scare stores companies</text>
  <text start="739.67" dur="8.67">into buying as much as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="743.32" dur="9.01">before everything collapses we talked</text>
  <text start="748.34" dur="6.42">about this where these retailers and</text>
  <text start="752.33" dur="3.57">companies they believe that tariffs are</text>
  <text start="754.76" dur="3.56">going to hit and it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="755.9" dur="5.28">complete and utter disaster in 2019 and</text>
  <text start="758.32" dur="5.95">they&amp;#39;ve been purchasing and stocking up</text>
  <text start="761.18" dur="7.02">the warehouses like crazy how else do</text>
  <text start="764.27" dur="7.41">you make the country prep for the</text>
  <text start="768.2" dur="5.01">collapse of the central bank well you</text>
  <text start="771.68" dur="3.48">can do it in many different ways Trump</text>
  <text start="773.21" dur="5.88">decided you know what I can use tariffs</text>
  <text start="775.16" dur="6.5">and the money that is coming in through</text>
  <text start="779.09" dur="6.21">the tariffs has surged in recent months</text>
  <text start="781.66" dur="5.73">so in other words if Congress were to</text>
  <text start="785.3" dur="5.07">simply monetize the tower&amp;#39;s revenues</text>
  <text start="787.39" dur="6.16">this could pay for the wall if you</text>
  <text start="790.37" dur="5.19">really think about it now the Federal</text>
  <text start="793.55" dur="3.81">Reserve they understand now remember</text>
  <text start="795.56" dur="3.18">there&amp;#39;s bad guys they&amp;#39;re good guys</text>
  <text start="797.36" dur="4.29">within the Federal Reserve I believe</text>
  <text start="798.74" dur="4.71">Powell is working with Trump and this is</text>
  <text start="801.65" dur="3.78">why he&amp;#39;s continually raising the rates I</text>
  <text start="803.45" dur="3.36">know he put out there that oh and said</text>
  <text start="805.43" dur="4.95">three times we&amp;#39;re gonna maybe do it two</text>
  <text start="806.81" dur="5.52">times in 2019 the rest of the Fed heads</text>
  <text start="810.38" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re really worried because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="812.33" dur="6.48">part of the old system where they like</text>
  <text start="815.48" dur="5.49">what they&amp;#39;re doing they like the central</text>
  <text start="818.81" dur="3.39">bank system a lot of companies like</text>
  <text start="820.97" dur="3.78">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people like this the</text>

  <text start="827.24" dur="4.23">message he believes the Fed should hold</text>
  <text start="829.49" dur="5.88">off on its next interest rate hike until</text>
  <text start="831.47" dur="4.41">the second half of 2019 now does this</text>
  <text start="835.37" dur="3.78">mean</text>
  <text start="835.88" dur="5.88">Powell&amp;#39;s going to listen to him or is he</text>
  <text start="839.15" dur="4.2">gonna do what Trump wants where I think</text>
  <text start="841.76" dur="4.5">Trump does want the interest rates</text>
  <text start="843.35" dur="4.77">moving up remember queue has already let</text>
  <text start="846.26" dur="3.45">us know they already know the plan of</text>
  <text start="848.12" dur="5.61">the central bank I do believe that this</text>
  <text start="849.71" dur="6.36">is their plan and I believe that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="853.73" dur="4.23">trying to bring down the central bank</text>
  <text start="856.07" dur="4.35">system because how do you transition</text>
  <text start="857.96" dur="5">into something completely different you</text>
  <text start="860.42" dur="4.8">destroy the old and bring in the new</text>
  <text start="862.96" dur="4.6">it&amp;#39;s almost like having a company go</text>

  <text start="885.68" dur="3.54">of Powell second he better not interrupt</text>
  <text start="887.99" dur="3.27">what the Fed is doing because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="889.22" dur="5.61">supposed to be independent and we have</text>
  <text start="891.26" dur="6.06">some quotes here where certain</text>
  <text start="894.83" dur="4.95">individuals are out there saying that</text>
  <text start="897.32" dur="4.92">the Fed needs to be independent now this</text>
  <text start="899.78" dur="4.17">is from Mark Zandi if investors don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="902.24" dur="4.38">believe the Fed is independent they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="903.95" dur="4.86">going to bail an independent central</text>
