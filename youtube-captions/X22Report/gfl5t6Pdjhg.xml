  <text start="56.88" dur="5.01">report my name is Dave and the zip sewed</text>
  <text start="59.27" dur="5.23">1,500 for a and today&amp;#39;s date is February</text>
  <text start="61.89" dur="5.22">21st 2018 and the thought of the episode</text>
  <text start="64.5" dur="5.45">is as the old economic system breaks</text>
  <text start="67.11" dur="5.13">down a new one is born from the ashes</text>
  <text start="69.95" dur="4.93">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="72.24" dur="4.56">financial news now we know the central</text>
  <text start="74.88" dur="3.78">bankers they&amp;#39;re very worried about the</text>
  <text start="76.8" dur="4.26">crypto market and and we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="78.66" dur="5.73">about it with the biz the IMF the New</text>
  <text start="81.06" dur="4.919">York Fed the - economist Christine</text>
  <text start="84.39" dur="4.11">Lagarde where they&amp;#39;re all out there</text>
  <text start="85.979" dur="4.081">telling us you know cryptocurrencies is</text>
  <text start="88.5" dur="4.41">used by terrorists it&amp;#39;s used by</text>
  <text start="90.06" dur="4.59">criminals it&amp;#39;s very volatile it&amp;#39;s backed</text>
  <text start="92.91" dur="3.3">by nothing and they keep making all</text>
  <text start="94.65" dur="4.32">these different arguments to steer</text>
  <text start="96.21" dur="4.44">everyone away from crypto currencies we</text>
  <text start="98.97" dur="3.81">can see right now that they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="100.65" dur="4.02">make the case that you don&amp;#39;t want to get</text>
  <text start="102.78" dur="3.449">in to crypto currencies because the</text>
  <text start="104.67" dur="4.14">exchanges they&amp;#39;re not secure you know</text>
  <text start="106.229" dur="4.921">just like the Swift system that is just</text>
  <text start="108.81" dur="4.71">so secure the banking system just so</text>
  <text start="111.15" dur="5.219">secure the whole entire Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="113.52" dur="4.89">which has been hacked which is so secure</text>
  <text start="116.369" dur="3.541">they&amp;#39;re continually doing this and</text>
  <text start="118.41" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re pushing their agenda I mean back</text>
  <text start="119.91" dur="5.489">in about a month ago Japan they had a</text>
  <text start="123.36" dur="6.179">cyber attack and over 400 million worth</text>
  <text start="125.399" dur="6.271">of nem coins was stolen from the Tokyo</text>
  <text start="129.539" dur="3.451">based coin check exchange and remember</text>
  <text start="131.67" dur="3.3">these are links that link up to the</text>
  <text start="132.99" dur="4.65">blockchain where people keep their</text>
  <text start="134.97" dur="4.86">accounts they keep wallets on these</text>
  <text start="137.64" dur="6.2">exchanges I think it&amp;#39;s better to have an</text>
  <text start="139.83" dur="7.2">offline wallet then keeping your your</text>
  <text start="143.84" dur="6.04">cryptocurrency on an online wallet I</text>
  <text start="147.03" dur="4.2">think it&amp;#39;s a little bit safer and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="149.88" dur="4.56">little bit harder for people to access</text>
  <text start="151.23" dur="4.53">but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="154.44" dur="3.51">seeing a lot of these different glitches</text>
  <text start="155.76" dur="6.09">that are occurring and it looks like</text>
  <text start="157.95" dur="6.27">there was another glitch where traders</text>
  <text start="161.85" dur="5.4">were able to purchase about 20 trillion</text>
  <text start="164.22" dur="4.8">in Bitcoin for free it lasted about 18</text>
  <text start="167.25" dur="4.44">minutes they tried to cash in on it and</text>
  <text start="169.02" dur="4.74">again nothing really happened here but</text>
  <text start="171.69" dur="5.37">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="173.76" dur="5.4">trying to build this case that crypto</text>
  <text start="177.06" dur="4.8">currencies these exchanges they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="179.16" dur="5.07">secure and you can see there are so many</text>
  <text start="181.86" dur="4.59">problems with it but again if you look</text>
  <text start="184.23" dur="2.85">at the everyday banking system and you</text>
  <text start="186.45" dur="1.8">look at all</text>
  <text start="187.08" dur="3.87">systems around the world anything</text>
  <text start="188.25" dur="5.3">electronic is not going to be 100%</text>
  <text start="190.95" dur="5.97">secure it&amp;#39;s completely impossible</text>
  <text start="193.55" dur="6.16">especially when the CIA is building</text>
  <text start="196.92" dur="5.28">backdoors into all the computer chips</text>
  <text start="199.71" dur="4.8">where they have access to all these</text>
  <text start="202.2" dur="3.81">different systems now we know that</text>
  <text start="204.51" dur="2.64">Russia and China and many other</text>
  <text start="206.01" dur="3.45">countries they&amp;#39;re building their own</text>
  <text start="207.15" dur="4.26">computer systems to be separate and</text>
  <text start="209.46" dur="3.45">apart from what the CIA has been doing</text>
  <text start="211.41" dur="5.28">but we could see right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="212.91" dur="6.27">building their their propaganda to make</text>
  <text start="216.69" dur="4.02">you think that the crypto market is not</text>
  <text start="219.18" dur="3.93">a safe place to be and you need to be</text>
  <text start="220.71" dur="3.96">someplace else and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="223.11" dur="4.11">pushing this agenda now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="224.67" dur="5.039">seeing right now are there are many many</text>
  <text start="227.22" dur="5.64">countries that are looking at crypto</text>
  <text start="229.709" dur="6.991">currencies to use as their currency for</text>
  <text start="232.86" dur="6.3">their country or to sell oil in some</text>
  <text start="236.7" dur="3.69">type of crypto coin and we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="239.16" dur="4.049">to see countries starting to produce</text>
  <text start="240.39" dur="4.47">these we know that in Russia they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="243.209" dur="4.921">Parliament right now they&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="244.86" dur="5.22">push the Russian ruble coin we know</text>
  <text start="248.13" dur="4.65">China probably is going to fold and look</text>
  <text start="250.08" dur="5.25">at the crypto market South Korea right</text>
  <text start="252.78" dur="5.94">now they&amp;#39;re making individuals go to the</text>
  <text start="255.33" dur="4.98">bank to exchange or purchase any type of</text>
  <text start="258.72" dur="4.11">cryptocurrency because they want to know</text>
  <text start="260.31" dur="3.93">who is doing it and of course the only</text>
  <text start="262.83" dur="2.91">reason they&amp;#39;re doing that is because the</text>
  <text start="264.24" dur="4.02">central bankers they have control of the</text>
  <text start="265.74" dur="5.22">system and they want to keep track of</text>
  <text start="268.26" dur="4.74">who has what now the ledger does keep</text>
  <text start="270.96" dur="3.72">track of all this but it keeps your</text>
  <text start="273" dur="4.65">address and your name pretty much</text>
  <text start="274.68" dur="5.7">anonymous and they don&amp;#39;t like this they</text>
  <text start="277.65" dur="6.15">don&amp;#39;t like not knowing who&amp;#39;s doing what</text>
  <text start="280.38" dur="5.28">and we can see right now that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="283.8" dur="7.23">continually pushing this agenda now</text>
  <text start="285.66" dur="8.52">we&amp;#39;re going to see a new system born out</text>
  <text start="291.03" dur="4.59">of the ashes of the old system and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="294.18" dur="3.51">already starting it&amp;#39;s almost like a</text>
  <text start="295.62" dur="5.1">Phoenix where the Phoenix reaches a</text>
  <text start="297.69" dur="5.85">certain point in in its lifespan where</text>
  <text start="300.72" dur="5.58">it starts to break down and it burns out</text>
  <text start="303.54" dur="4.98">turns into ashes and a new Phoenix is</text>
  <text start="306.3" dur="5.34">born this is what we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="308.52" dur="5.459">happen here now the new economic system</text>
  <text start="311.64" dur="4.14">that is born is that going to be a</text>
  <text start="313.979" dur="4.321">central bank system or is it going to be</text>
  <text start="315.78" dur="4.59">a cryptocurrency type of system outside</text>
  <text start="318.3" dur="6.06">of the banking system</text>
  <text start="320.37" dur="6.21">and being very optimistic that when all</text>
  <text start="324.36" dur="5.97">said and done that the central bankers</text>
  <text start="326.58" dur="6.03">will lose this time hopefully and again</text>
  <text start="330.33" dur="4.44">the central bankers they play dirty they</text>
  <text start="332.61" dur="4.71">don&amp;#39;t like to lose but what we do see</text>
  <text start="334.77" dur="5.16">happening here is that the economy is</text>
  <text start="337.32" dur="3.93">rapidly deteriorating and I know a lot</text>
  <text start="339.93" dur="3.9">of people think that the economy&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="341.25" dur="4.199">fine everything looks great and of</text>
  <text start="343.83" dur="3.21">course this is part of the illusion I</text>
  <text start="345.449" dur="2.28">mean everyone thought the economy was</text>
  <text start="347.04" dur="4.379">fantastic</text>
  <text start="347.729" dur="4.741">in 2008 until October hit and all of a</text>
  <text start="351.419" dur="2.281">sudden everything started to fall apart</text>
  <text start="352.47" dur="2.82">I mean they were telling us that</text>
  <text start="353.7" dur="3.779">everything was great everything was</text>
  <text start="355.29" dur="3.99">sustained everything was fantastic the</text>
  <text start="357.479" dur="3.031">subprime securities were a triple a back</text>
  <text start="359.28" dur="3.21">don&amp;#39;t worry about it</text>
  <text start="360.51" dur="5.25">same things happening that but it&amp;#39;s much</text>
  <text start="362.49" dur="5.04">worse people are so in the dark they</text>
  <text start="365.76" dur="5.659">don&amp;#39;t realize what is happening why do</text>
  <text start="367.53" dur="7.08">you think interest rates are at close or</text>
  <text start="371.419" dur="5.951">lower than 0% negative in certain parts</text>
  <text start="374.61" dur="6.54">of the world it&amp;#39;s because we&amp;#39;re at the</text>
  <text start="377.37" dur="5.03">end of the system why do you think wages</text>
  <text start="381.15" dur="4.2">are falling why do you think</text>
  <text start="382.4" dur="5.86">manufacturing has been moved out of this</text>
  <text start="385.35" dur="6.48">country why do you think they were</text>
  <text start="388.26" dur="5.909">bringing in third-world illegals into</text>
  <text start="391.83" dur="3.87">this country I mean there are many</text>
  <text start="394.169" dur="4.191">different agendas associated with but</text>
  <text start="395.7" dur="6.51">they thought and this was going back</text>
  <text start="398.36" dur="6.13">when Obama was president and they had</text>
  <text start="402.21" dur="4.079">the power there and of course they still</text>
  <text start="404.49" dur="4.799">think they have the power but they</text>
  <text start="406.289" dur="7.021">thought they were going to create a</text>
  <text start="409.289" dur="5.641">brand new economic system and they were</text>
  <text start="413.31" dur="3.96">going to make all the countries on a</text>
  <text start="414.93" dur="4.59">level playing field and everyone was</text>
  <text start="417.27" dur="4.11">going to get paid the same rate now all</text>
  <text start="419.52" dur="3.269">the other countries were not going to</text>
  <text start="421.38" dur="3.719">come up to the level of the United</text>
  <text start="422.789" dur="4.021">States the United States had to come</text>
  <text start="425.099" dur="4.591">down to the level of all the other</text>
  <text start="426.81" dur="4.44">countries and this is the reason they</text>
  <text start="429.69" dur="2.76">were bringing in a lot of illegals this</text>
  <text start="431.25" dur="2.639">is one of the reasons there&amp;#39;s many other</text>
  <text start="432.45" dur="2.25">reasons associated with it you know</text>
  <text start="433.889" dur="3.301">elections</text>
  <text start="434.7" dur="3.149">Obamacare and other things but we see</text>
  <text start="437.19" dur="4.89">right now</text>
  <text start="437.849" dur="4.861">they knew the economy wasn&amp;#39;t going to</text>
  <text start="442.08" dur="3.12">last</text>
  <text start="442.71" dur="4.019">they knew eventually they were going to</text>
  <text start="445.2" dur="2.85">have to switch it over into something</text>
  <text start="446.729" dur="3.541">completely different this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="448.05" dur="4.049">been moving everything out to China</text>
  <text start="450.27" dur="3.869">manufacturing this is why China has been</text>
  <text start="452.099" dur="4.261">building up their gold reserves</text>
  <text start="454.139" dur="4.02">this way it builds confidence in the</text>
  <text start="456.36" dur="4.799">system this is why they started the</text>
  <text start="458.159" dur="4.861">petrol you won their whole plan and this</text>
  <text start="461.159" dur="4.94">is the central bankers plan was to have</text>
  <text start="463.02" dur="6.03">this system out in the East and then</text>
  <text start="466.099" dur="4.391">cryptocurrencies were born back in 2008</text>
  <text start="469.05" dur="3.209">a lot of people didn&amp;#39;t realize what it</text>
  <text start="470.49" dur="3.479">was and they didn&amp;#39;t know what it was and</text>
  <text start="472.259" dur="3.69">it started to grow and then people</text>
  <text start="473.969" dur="4.891">started to realize wow this is something</text>
  <text start="475.949" dur="4.47">amazing and we can see right now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="478.86" dur="4.41">at this point but when we look at the</text>
  <text start="480.419" dur="5.31">economy we see that it is falling apart</text>
  <text start="483.27" dur="3.929">existing home sales tumbled by three</text>
  <text start="485.729" dur="3.72">point two percent month-on-month this is</text>
  <text start="487.199" dur="5.551">the lowest level since August of 2016</text>
  <text start="489.449" dur="7.411">now year-on-year home sales are down by</text>
  <text start="492.75" dur="7.409">4.8% now think about this when we look</text>
  <text start="496.86" dur="6.359">at home sales we have to wonder why</text>
  <text start="500.159" dur="5.671">we&amp;#39;re seeing this up-and-down type of</text>
  <text start="503.219" dur="4.651">situation in home sales and we have to</text>
  <text start="505.83" dur="4.019">understand why this is happening</text>
  <text start="507.87" dur="5.7">remember hedge funds investment</text>
  <text start="509.849" dur="5.791">companies they were receiving free money</text>
  <text start="513.57" dur="3.93">from the Fed they were instructed to</text>
  <text start="515.64" dur="3.66">purchase as many houses as possible</text>
  <text start="517.5" dur="6.39">banks were instructed to keep houses off</text>
  <text start="519.3" dur="7.05">the market to drive prices up China was</text>
  <text start="523.89" dur="4.259">investing in the United States many</text>
  <text start="526.35" dur="3.72">other countries were investing in the</text>
  <text start="528.149" dur="6">United States a lot of these investors</text>
  <text start="530.07" dur="6.389">have left and China now is reversing and</text>
  <text start="534.149" dur="4.081">they&amp;#39;re taking their funds and investing</text>
  <text start="536.459" dur="4.981">in the one belt one Road this is why</text>
  <text start="538.23" dur="6.12">Canada their housing crisis is upon them</text>
  <text start="541.44" dur="4.829">Australia seeing the same thing and we</text>
  <text start="544.35" dur="4.859">are seeing u.s. mortgage applications</text>
  <text start="546.269" dur="5.461">well they are tumbling right now and</text>
  <text start="549.209" dur="5.37">it&amp;#39;s getting worse as time goes on why</text>
  <text start="551.73" dur="5.52">well the interest rates are slowly</text>
  <text start="554.579" dur="4.591">creeping up and every time you have the</text>
  <text start="557.25" dur="4.11">interest rates move up you see mortgage</text>
  <text start="559.17" dur="6.06">applications decline you see sales and</text>
  <text start="561.36" dur="5.76">homes decline this is a pattern that</text>
  <text start="565.23" dur="4.08">we&amp;#39;ve seen before now the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="567.12" dur="5.399">this is how they kick a lot of this off</text>
  <text start="569.31" dur="6">what they do is they slowly move the</text>
  <text start="572.519" dur="4.591">interest rates up now back prior to 2008</text>
  <text start="575.31" dur="3.69">they were able to do this a lot faster</text>
  <text start="577.11" dur="4.8">because the economy was actually much</text>
  <text start="579" dur="4.74">stronger now the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="581.91" dur="4.08">completely built on an illusion and</text>
  <text start="583.74" dur="3.99">never got stronger the housing market</text>
  <text start="585.99" dur="3.839">was propped up you</text>
  <text start="587.73" dur="4.56">American everyday person is sitting on</text>
  <text start="589.829" dur="4.2">the sidelines retails a disaster GDP</text>
  <text start="592.29" dur="3.299">numbers are a disaster the unemployment</text>
  <text start="594.029" dur="3.65">numbers are completely fake</text>
  <text start="595.589" dur="5.37">so are the GDP numbers by the way and</text>
  <text start="597.679" dur="5.47">everything is starting to implode on</text>
  <text start="600.959" dur="4.65">itself and what we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="603.149" dur="4.59">happen here is it&amp;#39;s going to get worse</text>
  <text start="605.609" dur="5.48">as time goes on it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="607.739" dur="6.21">improve actually the Fed president is</text>
  <text start="611.089" dur="5.5">panicking over the level of US debt</text>
  <text start="613.949" dur="5.13">saying the u.s. may need to more</text>
  <text start="616.589" dur="4.62">actively consider policy actions that</text>
  <text start="619.079" dur="4.081">would moderate the path of projected US</text>
  <text start="621.209" dur="5.28">government debt growth he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="623.16" dur="6.209">the government is responsible for the</text>
  <text start="626.489" dur="6.06">u.s. debt now think about what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="629.369" dur="6.08">saying right here that the Fed had no</text>
  <text start="632.549" dur="7.41">problem during the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="635.449" dur="7.12">which really completely doubled the debt</text>
  <text start="639.959" dur="6.48">in this country Trump has been president</text>
  <text start="642.569" dur="6.48">now for a year or so and the debt level</text>
  <text start="646.439" dur="5.281">went up 1 trillion compared to what 10</text>
  <text start="649.049" dur="4.98">trillion so let&amp;#39;s think about this for a</text>
  <text start="651.72" dur="5.219">second why are they so worried about</text>
  <text start="654.029" dur="5.49">this right now because if the system</text>
  <text start="656.939" dur="5.4">comes down without the central bank</text>
  <text start="659.519" dur="5.25">bringing it down blaming it on someone</text>
  <text start="662.339" dur="4.92">else and it comes down under this debt</text>
  <text start="664.769" dur="5.61">level they&amp;#39;re to blame</text>
  <text start="667.259" dur="5.33">they don&amp;#39;t want countries to implode on</text>
  <text start="670.379" dur="4.71">themselves look at Greece look at Cyprus</text>
  <text start="672.589" dur="4.84">look at France look at all these</text>
  <text start="675.089" dur="6.06">countries what the central bankers like</text>
  <text start="677.429" dur="6.09">to do is they like to keep it on an even</text>
  <text start="681.149" dur="5.88">playing field where they have a lot of</text>
  <text start="683.519" dur="6.51">debt but they can still get by they</text>
  <text start="687.029" dur="6">never want to crash a country because</text>
  <text start="690.029" dur="5.1">that would be too obvious of what</text>
  <text start="693.029" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re trying to do and everyone would</text>
  <text start="695.129" dur="5.4">point the finger at them and saying hey</text>
  <text start="697.199" dur="5.61">you just crashed this country why so if</text>
  <text start="700.529" dur="5.52">they put them into debt they push</text>
  <text start="702.809" dur="5.13">austerity on the government saying you</text>
  <text start="706.049" dur="4.44">have to do these things people lose</text>
  <text start="707.939" dur="5.911">their jobs they take on more credit they</text>
  <text start="710.489" dur="5.7">can keep this balance this the seesaw of</text>
  <text start="713.85" dur="5.099">making sure it doesn&amp;#39;t tilt to one side</text>
  <text start="716.189" dur="5.371">and they can continually add more and</text>
  <text start="718.949" dur="4.111">more and more debt to the country</text>
  <text start="721.56" dur="3.24">and eventually what the country has to</text>
  <text start="723.06" dur="4.469">do is they have to sell off assets</text>
  <text start="724.8" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s their main goal they want hard</text>
  <text start="727.529" dur="3.601">assets because they&amp;#39;re creating currency</text>
  <text start="729.06" dur="5.64">out of thin air they don&amp;#39;t want the fake</text>
  <text start="731.13" dur="7.02">money the fake currency they want assets</text>
  <text start="734.7" dur="6.53">and that&amp;#39;s why they do this and this is</text>
  <text start="738.15" dur="5.52">why the Fed is so worried right now and</text>
  <text start="741.23" dur="6.25">we can see that other countries right</text>
  <text start="743.67" dur="5.88">now who are sanctioned who are looking</text>
  <text start="747.48" dur="3.54">at the dollar they&amp;#39;re saying you know</text>

  <text start="855.79" dur="5.14">Venezuela which is heavenly sanctioned</text>
  <text start="858.41" dur="5.34">the United States the deep state wanted</text>

  <text start="863.75" dur="4.5">cryptocurrency and think about this go</text>
  <text start="866.63" dur="3.39">back in time when all the other</text>
  <text start="868.25" dur="4.17">countries were sanctioned there was</text>
  <text start="870.02" dur="4.43">really no way to do anything because</text>
  <text start="872.42" dur="4.8">cryptocurrencies didn&amp;#39;t exist so</text>
  <text start="874.45" dur="6.52">cryptocurrencies now exist and it</text>
  <text start="877.22" dur="9.75">allowed this country to create its own</text>
  <text start="880.97" dur="9.71">currency have it sold to other investors</text>
  <text start="886.97" dur="8.18">around the world attach it to aisle</text>
  <text start="890.68" dur="8.44">which bypasses the dollar completely and</text>
  <text start="895.15" dur="7.3">the US government the deep state can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="899.12" dur="5.12">do anything about it I mean yeah they</text>
  <text start="902.45" dur="4.95">can attack the country and all that but</text>
  <text start="904.24" dur="7.539">in regards to the petrol it is theirs</text>
  <text start="907.4" dur="8.18">and it&amp;#39;s on the blockchain now other</text>
  <text start="911.779" dur="6.691">countries are going to look at this and</text>
  <text start="915.58" dur="5.44">they&amp;#39;re gonna be watching Venezuela as</text>
  <text start="918.47" dur="4.35">time goes on and if they are which I do</text>
  <text start="921.02" dur="4.7">believe they will be very successful</text>
  <text start="922.82" dur="5.73">with this and they&amp;#39;ll start making sales</text>
  <text start="925.72" dur="6.28">other countries are going to say why</text>
  <text start="928.55" dur="7.77">don&amp;#39;t we do the same exact thing this is</text>
  <text start="932" dur="5.58">a template to allow other countries to</text>
  <text start="936.32" dur="6.6">do the same thing now think about this</text>
  <text start="937.58" dur="9.9">for a second if Iran Iraq Syria Lebanon</text>
  <text start="942.92" dur="6.81">Libya Saudi Arabia all these different</text>
  <text start="947.48" dur="4.74">countries that have oil or maybe gold</text>
  <text start="949.73" dur="4.5">deposits and things like that look at</text>
  <text start="952.22" dur="5.22">this model and say you know something</text>
  <text start="954.23" dur="5.9">let&amp;#39;s follow it let&amp;#39;s get rid of the</text>
  <text start="957.44" dur="6.769">dollar let&amp;#39;s go onto the blockchain</text>
  <text start="960.13" dur="9.61">let&amp;#39;s create our own and sell it and</text>
  <text start="964.209" dur="9.521">trade on the blockchain this is a brand</text>
  <text start="969.74" dur="8.34">new economic system separate and apart</text>
  <text start="973.73" dur="6.21">from the dollar and the country the deep</text>
  <text start="978.08" dur="4.259">state was trying to put a lot of</text>
  <text start="979.94" dur="5.73">pressure on actually started the whole</text>
  <text start="982.339" dur="5.581">thing off I mean think about this person</text>
  <text start="985.67" dur="3.35">yes there&amp;#39;s a lot of coins out there but</text>
  <text start="987.92" dur="2.66">this is</text>
  <text start="989.02" dur="4.319">the first countries that attach it to</text>
  <text start="990.58" dur="6.509">aisle and they&amp;#39;re actually going to use</text>
  <text start="993.339" dur="7.44">this to bring in income to the country</text>
  <text start="997.089" dur="6.841">and once other countries see this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1000.779" dur="5.791">not gonna take that much time it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1003.93" dur="4.37">to happen very very quickly because</text>
  <text start="1006.57" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re gonna use the etherium</text>

  <text start="1016.14" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s not going to take three years four</text>
  <text start="1018.149" dur="4.711">years five years it&amp;#39;s going to take a</text>
  <text start="1020.73" dur="5.31">couple of months if these countries</text>
  <text start="1022.86" dur="7.589">start to do this which it&amp;#39;s very easy to</text>
  <text start="1026.04" dur="7.1">do guess what within six to eight months</text>
  <text start="1030.449" dur="7.23">you&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot of countries</text>
  <text start="1033.14" dur="7.569">completely bypassing the dollar they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1037.679" dur="7.13">on the crypto currency system the</text>
  <text start="1040.709" dur="8.821">blockchain system which leads us back to</text>
  <text start="1044.809" dur="7.601">the transition the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="1049.53" dur="4.95">don&amp;#39;t like the blockchain they hate it</text>
  <text start="1052.41" dur="3.81">they can&amp;#39;t control it they want to</text>
  <text start="1054.48" dur="5.01">control it but I don&amp;#39;t think they can</text>
  <text start="1056.22" dur="5.82">unless they create their own coin and</text>
  <text start="1059.49" dur="4.83">they force governments to pass a law to</text>
  <text start="1062.04" dur="4.35">say you&amp;#39;re only allowed to use this one</text>
  <text start="1064.32" dur="4.29">yes then they would have control this is</text>
  <text start="1066.39" dur="5.52">what they did with the currency the</text>
  <text start="1068.61" dur="5.58">paper currency they had the government</text>
  <text start="1071.91" dur="3.6">passed a law and say you will use the</text>
  <text start="1074.19" dur="2.91">Federal Reserve Note this is the only</text>
  <text start="1075.51" dur="3.78">currency you can use and then other</text>
  <text start="1077.1" dur="4.1">countries followed suit and they joined</text>
  <text start="1079.29" dur="3.69">in with the central banking system</text>
  <text start="1081.2" dur="5.109">that&amp;#39;s the only way they can do it</text>
  <text start="1082.98" dur="7.35">otherwise they have no control over this</text>
  <text start="1086.309" dur="9.241">whatsoever and we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="1090.33" dur="8.46">the start of the transition and we can</text>
  <text start="1095.55" dur="5.9">see that the central bankers they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1098.79" dur="5.46">want this and they will play dirty and</text>
  <text start="1101.45" dur="5.05">they will try to steer everyone away</text>
  <text start="1104.25" dur="4.98">from it they might even try to destroy</text>
  <text start="1106.5" dur="7.94">it somehow some way but we can see right</text>
  <text start="1109.23" dur="8.76">now we&amp;#39;re heading to a brand new system</text>
  <text start="1114.44" dur="6.31">separate and apart from the old system</text>
  <text start="1117.99" dur="4.65">and countries are going to jump on this</text>
  <text start="1120.75" dur="4.17">bandwagon very very quickly</text>
  <text start="1122.64" dur="4.05">and you&amp;#39;re gonna see announcements all</text>
  <text start="1124.92" dur="4.29">over the place that countries are</text>
  <text start="1126.69" dur="5.64">creating their own it&amp;#39;s outside of the</text>
  <text start="1129.21" dur="6.6">system and it has nothing to do with the</text>
  <text start="1132.33" dur="6.09">dollar and once countries start to ramp</text>
  <text start="1135.81" dur="5.37">up on this it&amp;#39;s game over for the</text>
  <text start="1138.42" dur="4.41">central bank and we&amp;#39;re gonna be going</text>
  <text start="1141.18" dur="3.15">through this transition because again</text>
  <text start="1142.83" dur="4.59">this will affect the United States</text>
  <text start="1144.33" dur="4.38">because the dollar they&amp;#39;re all gonna</text>
  <text start="1147.42" dur="3.36">flow back the United States we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1148.71" dur="5.57">see inflation and then this really means</text>
  <text start="1150.78" dur="6.18">that nobody needs the dollar anymore</text>
  <text start="1154.28" dur="6.94">nobody needs to sell their oil in the</text>
  <text start="1156.96" dur="6.93">petro dollar anymore that means we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1161.22" dur="5.07">going to have to adjust that means the</text>
  <text start="1163.89" dur="5.31">transition is going to be into a new</text>
  <text start="1166.29" dur="4.74">currency that means that the value of</text>
  <text start="1169.2" dur="4.86">the dollar is going to decrease rapidly</text>
  <text start="1171.03" dur="6.84">and cryptocurrencies are going to</text>
  <text start="1174.06" dur="6.81">increase in value gold silver is going</text>
  <text start="1177.87" dur="4.08">to increase in value because gold and</text>
  <text start="1180.87" dur="2.01">silver is really not attached to the</text>
  <text start="1181.95" dur="2.91">dollar whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1182.88" dur="3.66">yes it&amp;#39;s manipulated right now but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1184.86" dur="5.06">not has nothing to do with the dollar</text>
  <text start="1186.54" dur="6.74">really and that will increase in value</text>
  <text start="1189.92" dur="5.77">because there&amp;#39;ll be no reason to</text>
  <text start="1193.28" dur="6.55">manipulate it anymore because the dollar</text>
  <text start="1195.69" dur="5.94">is destroyed and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="1199.83" dur="5.25">this is something the central banks</text>
  <text start="1201.63" dur="6.03">don&amp;#39;t want this is something the people</text>
  <text start="1205.08" dur="5.25">want so no matter what we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="1207.66" dur="4.17">going through a transition so you need</text>
  <text start="1210.33" dur="4.11">to be prepared and ready because when</text>
  <text start="1211.83" dur="4.68">the system breaks down it&amp;#39;s gonna be a</text>
  <text start="1214.44" dur="4.97">very difficult time because the dollar</text>
  <text start="1216.51" dur="5.31">is going to lose value very very quickly</text>
  <text start="1219.41" dur="5.41">credit most likely is going to freeze up</text>
  <text start="1221.82" dur="4.83">until we&amp;#39;re on board onto the new system</text>
  <text start="1224.82" dur="4.53">and that might take a couple of months</text>
  <text start="1226.65" dur="4.47">it might take a year before everything</text>
  <text start="1229.35" dur="4.77">is ironed out I mean look at when we</text>
  <text start="1231.12" dur="5.15">came off the gold standard in 1971 when</text>
  <text start="1234.12" dur="5.52">we had the oil shortages a lot of jobs</text>
  <text start="1236.27" dur="5.19">no one could find jobs I mean people are</text>
  <text start="1239.64" dur="5.16">having a very difficult time in the 70s</text>
  <text start="1241.46" dur="5.98">yes we saw incredible inflation at that</text>
  <text start="1244.8" dur="5.52">time people love the CDs at that time</text>
  <text start="1247.44" dur="5.45">but that was coming off a a a system</text>
  <text start="1250.32" dur="4.68">that was backed by gold moving on to a</text>
  <text start="1252.89" dur="3.1">system that was backed by pretty much</text>
  <text start="1255" dur="3.87">nothing</text>
  <text start="1255.99" dur="4.38">and we didn&amp;#39;t have that much debt now</text>
  <text start="1258.87" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re coming off a system where the</text>
  <text start="1260.37" dur="5.73">dollar is devalued so much and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1263.85" dur="3.75">going to be devalued even more where we</text>
