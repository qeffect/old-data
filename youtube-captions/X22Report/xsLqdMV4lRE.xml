  <text start="93.46" dur="6.299">they tried to use Moeller and what he</text>
  <text start="96.88" dur="6.69">said in his press conference they tried</text>
  <text start="99.759" dur="5.25">to use it to push impeachment and those</text>

  <text start="105.009" dur="5.911">starting to realize they have absolutely</text>
  <text start="108.28" dur="5.129">nothing because when you look at the</text>
  <text start="110.92" dur="6.54">rule of law and you look at what Muller</text>
  <text start="113.409" dur="6.57">was saying he doesn&amp;#39;t decide if someone</text>
  <text start="117.46" dur="4.829">is innocent or guilty and these</text>
  <text start="119.979" dur="5.551">individuals are starting to realize</text>
  <text start="122.289" dur="5.311">there&amp;#39;s going to be no evidence provided</text>
  <text start="125.53" dur="4.29">to them for them to follow through on</text>
  <text start="127.6" dur="4.62">impeachment so the deep state is</text>
  <text start="129.82" dur="5.4">cornered and the deep state is going to</text>
  <text start="132.22" dur="5.1">be exposed through video documentation</text>
  <text start="135.22" dur="5.4">and everything else they won&amp;#39;t be able</text>
  <text start="137.32" dur="5.76">to hide behind saying it is a fake video</text>
  <text start="140.62" dur="5.94">and we&amp;#39;re gonna be talking about that in</text>
  <text start="143.08" dur="6.45">just a minute well first let&amp;#39;s go back</text>
  <text start="146.56" dur="6.09">to Muller here and during his statement</text>
  <text start="149.53" dur="4.59">mother said he based his decision on the</text>
  <text start="152.65" dur="4.02">fact that via the office of legal</text>
  <text start="154.12" dur="3.87">counsel a president cannot be charged</text>
  <text start="156.67" dur="4.74">with a federal crime while he is in</text>
  <text start="157.99" dur="5.78">office that is unconstitutional but this</text>
  <text start="161.41" dur="4.43">was a lie author and legal expert</text>
  <text start="163.77" dur="4.17">gregg jarrett later revealed that this</text>
  <text start="165.84" dur="4.59">is the exact opposite of what mother</text>
  <text start="167.94" dur="4.98">told Attorney General Bill Bar back in</text>
  <text start="170.43" dur="4.29">March according to reports Muller told</text>
  <text start="172.92" dur="4.47">the Attorney General that the office of</text>
  <text start="174.72" dur="4.53">legal counsel opinion played no role in</text>
  <text start="177.39" dur="5.13">the special counsels decision-making or</text>
  <text start="179.25" dur="5.28">lack thereof now according to Bill Barr</text>
  <text start="182.52" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s not what mother told the Attorney</text>
  <text start="184.53" dur="4.89">General and others during a meeting on</text>
  <text start="186.42" dur="6">March 5th 2017 here&amp;#39;s what Bart told</text>
  <text start="189.42" dur="5.31">senators during his May first testimony</text>
  <text start="192.42" dur="4.38">we were frankly surprised that they were</text>
  <text start="194.73" dur="4.23">not going to reach a decision on</text>
  <text start="196.8" dur="4.29">obstruction and we asked them a lot</text>
  <text start="198.96" dur="3.87">about the reasoning behind this Muller</text>
  <text start="201.09" dur="4.68">stated three times to us in the meeting</text>
  <text start="202.83" dur="5.67">in response to our questioning that he</text>
  <text start="205.77" dur="4.95">emphatically was not saying that but for</text>
  <text start="208.5" dur="5.07">the OLC opinion he would have found</text>
  <text start="210.72" dur="4.26">obstruction Barr said there were others</text>
  <text start="213.57" dur="4.2">in the meeting who heard mothers say the</text>
  <text start="214.98" dur="4.77">same thing that the OLC opinion played</text>
  <text start="217.77" dur="4.23">no role in the special counsels</text>
  <text start="219.75" dur="4.59">decision-making or lack thereof the</text>
  <text start="222" dur="4.14">Attorney General repeated this in the</text>
  <text start="224.34" dur="3.54">news conference the day Muller&amp;#39;s report</text>
  <text start="226.14" dur="3.81">was released to the public we</text>
  <text start="227.88" dur="4.26">specifically asked him about the OLC</text>
  <text start="229.95" dur="4.2">opinion and whether or not he was taking</text>
  <text start="232.14" dur="4.44">the position that he would have found a</text>
  <text start="234.15" dur="4.8">crime but the but for the existence of</text>
  <text start="236.58" dur="5.1">the OLC opinion he made it very clear</text>
  <text start="238.95" dur="6.39">several times that this was not his</text>
  <text start="241.68" dur="6.87">position yet on Wednesday Muller was</text>
  <text start="245.34" dur="9.18">telling a different tale so it&amp;#39;s either</text>
  <text start="248.55" dur="9.21">that bill Barr lied or Muller lied and I</text>
  <text start="254.52" dur="5.82">do believe that Muller is the liar now</text>
  <text start="257.76" dur="4.59">this is coming out of the Federalist and</text>
  <text start="260.34" dur="5.55">it says Muller just proved his entire</text>
  <text start="262.35" dur="6.69">operation was a political hit job that</text>
  <text start="265.89" dur="6.75">trampled the rule of law so let&amp;#39;s start</text>
  <text start="269.04" dur="6.96">with Muller&amp;#39;s team his unique take on</text>
  <text start="272.64" dur="5.49">the nature of a prosecutor&amp;#39;s job the</text>
  <text start="276" dur="4.05">standard american view of justice</text>
  <text start="278.13" dur="4.71">affirmed and enforced by the US</text>
  <text start="280.05" dur="5.7">Constitution is that all are presumed</text>
  <text start="282.84" dur="4.56">innocent absent conviction by a jury of</text>
  <text start="285.75" dur="5.07">a specific charge of criminal wrongdoing</text>
  <text start="287.4" dur="5.28">that is the natural legal state of an</text>
  <text start="290.82" dur="5.19">image individual in this country is</text>
  <text start="292.68" dur="4.799">innocent it is not a state or a nature</text>
  <text start="296.01" dur="4.2">bestowed by cops</text>
  <text start="297.479" dur="5.041">or attorneys innocent is not granted by</text>
  <text start="300.21" dur="5.699">an unelected bureaucrats or federal</text>
  <text start="302.52" dur="5.669">prosecutors at one point in his remarks</text>
  <text start="305.909" dur="3.84">Muller seemed to agree referring to</text>
  <text start="308.189" dur="3.6">indictments against various Russian</text>
  <text start="309.749" dur="4.23">individuals and institutions for</text>
  <text start="311.789" dur="5.25">allegedly hacking American service</text>
  <text start="313.979" dur="6.511">during the 2016 election Muller said the</text>
  <text start="317.039" dur="5.91">indictment contain allegations and we</text>
  <text start="320.49" dur="4.739">are not commenting on the guilt or</text>
  <text start="322.949" dur="4.71">innocence of any specific defendant</text>
  <text start="325.229" dur="6.601">every defendant is presumed innocent</text>
  <text start="327.659" dur="6.421">unless and until proven guilty now he</text>
  <text start="331.83" dur="4.23">had stopped there he would have been</text>
  <text start="334.08" dur="4.559">correct but then he crafted a brand new</text>
  <text start="336.06" dur="4.02">standard the order appointing the</text>
  <text start="338.639" dur="3.721">special counsel authorized us to</text>
  <text start="340.08" dur="4.859">investigate actions that could obstruct</text>
  <text start="342.36" dur="4.829">the investigation we conducted that</text>
  <text start="344.939" dur="4.051">investigation and kept the office of the</text>
  <text start="347.189" dur="4.35">acting Attorney General apprised of our</text>
  <text start="348.99" dur="4.769">work this is what Muller said after the</text>
  <text start="351.539" dur="3.93">investigation if we had confidence that</text>
  <text start="353.759" dur="5.16">the president clearly did not commit a</text>
  <text start="355.469" dur="6.991">crime we would have said so now</text>
  <text start="358.919" dur="5.73">according to Muller and his team charged</text>
  <text start="362.46" dur="5.1">Russians are presumed innocent an</text>
  <text start="364.649" dur="5.341">American president however is presumed</text>
  <text start="367.56" dur="5.609">guilty unless and until Muller&amp;#39;s team</text>
  <text start="369.99" dur="5.669">determines he is innocent such a</text>
  <text start="373.169" dur="4.65">standard is an obscene abomination</text>
  <text start="375.659" dur="4.021">against the rule of law one that would</text>
  <text start="377.819" dur="4.02">never be committed by independent</text>
  <text start="379.68" dur="4.169">attorneys who place a fidelity to their</text>
  <text start="381.839" dur="4.44">oaths an impartial enforcement of the</text>
  <text start="383.849" dur="4.8">law ahead of their political motivations</text>
  <text start="386.279" dur="3.66">the contradictions and double standards</text>
  <text start="388.649" dur="4.8">didn&amp;#39;t stop there</text>
  <text start="389.939" dur="5.31">it would be unfair he said to</text>
  <text start="393.449" dur="4.231">potentially accuse somebody of a crime</text>
  <text start="395.249" dur="5.611">when there can be no court resolution of</text>
  <text start="397.68" dur="4.5">the actual charge after all but stating</text>
  <text start="400.86" dur="3.389">that Trump committed a crime for which</text>
  <text start="402.18" dur="4.139">Muller never charged him just as</text>
  <text start="404.249" dur="4.111">mother&amp;#39;s own words and actions at the</text>
  <text start="406.319" dur="4.171">press conference prove that he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="408.36" dur="2.549">want his team&amp;#39;s report to speak for</text>
  <text start="410.49" dur="3.63">itself</text>
  <text start="410.909" dur="6">the report itself proves that Muller and</text>
  <text start="414.12" dur="5.339">his team don&amp;#39;t believe it&amp;#39;s unfair to</text>
  <text start="416.909" dur="6.421">accuse somebody of something a court</text>
  <text start="419.459" dur="6.601">cannot resolve the prosecutor in a</text>
  <text start="423.33" dur="5.639">criminal case shall refrain from making</text>
  <text start="426.06" dur="4.97">extrajudicial comments that have a</text>

  <text start="437.15" dur="4.65">Association Bulls a Professional Conduct</text>
  <text start="439.42" dur="5.41">Muller&amp;#39;s performance made it clear for</text>
  <text start="441.8" dur="5.46">all to see that what he ran for the last</text>
  <text start="444.83" dur="4.35">two years was in an independent</text>
  <text start="447.26" dur="4.62">investigation pursuant to the rule of</text>
  <text start="449.18" dur="5.94">law so much as an inquisition motivated</text>
  <text start="451.88" dur="5.4">by political animus Muller and his team</text>
  <text start="455.12" dur="3.9">refused to charge prominent Democrats</text>
  <text start="457.28" dur="3.84">for crimes he charged against</text>

  <text start="482.27" dur="6.45">ignored and why were they ignored</text>
  <text start="484.22" dur="5.87">because this whole agenda was to set up</text>

  <text start="499.49" dur="4.76">all about because they wanted to have it</text>
  <text start="501.53" dur="5.76">on record that Clinton did nothing and</text>

  <text start="510.95" dur="4.11">didn&amp;#39;t get that so the whole report</text>
  <text start="513.589" dur="3.531">right now if you really look at it and</text>

  <text start="525.95" dur="5.1">this works it&amp;#39;s the opposite a</text>

  <text start="1422.559" dur="7.021">whatsoever now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="1425.17" dur="7.25">is that researchers are turning to</text>
  <text start="1429.58" dur="6.03">artificial intelligence to thwart</text>

  <text start="1443.41" dur="8.13">of yet but I do believe that the NSA and</text>
  <text start="1447.91" dur="7.71">others already mastered this problem</text>
  <text start="1451.54" dur="8.91">right now they can tell if a video is</text>
  <text start="1455.62" dur="6.45">fake or not so audio I do believe in the</text>
  <text start="1460.45" dur="4.14">private sector is being worked on but I</text>
  <text start="1462.07" dur="5.08">do believe the NSA already has that</text>
  <text start="1464.59" dur="4.81">technology so just wart</text>
  <text start="1467.15" dur="5.52">sophisticated methods of altering photos</text>

  <text start="1528.62" dur="4.95">what does that tell us</text>
  <text start="1529.87" dur="5.62">q has been telling us that this is not</text>
  <text start="1533.57" dur="4.35">going to help the deep state and guess</text>
  <text start="1535.49" dur="4.29">what it will not help the deep state</text>
  <text start="1537.92" dur="4.29">they will be exposed and I believe the</text>
  <text start="1539.78" dur="5.61">technology in the NSA they have the</text>
  <text start="1542.21" dur="6.99">technology already to detect fake videos</text>
  <text start="1545.39" dur="7.26">that detect fake audio and this is going</text>
  <text start="1549.2" dur="6.51">to be used when all this information</text>
  <text start="1552.65" dur="6.06">comes out and once this information</text>
  <text start="1555.71" dur="5.099">comes out the deep state they will try</text>
  <text start="1558.71" dur="4.74">to say hey these are fakes this is not</text>
  <text start="1560.809" dur="6.991">me that&amp;#39;s not my voice and then we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1563.45" dur="8.22">gonna see the detection process work and</text>
  <text start="1567.8" dur="7.68">show that this is original it is not a</text>
  <text start="1571.67" dur="7.41">fake it is exactly what we are seeing</text>
  <text start="1575.48" dur="6.44">the deep state they are going to be</text>
  <text start="1579.08" dur="5.31">exposed now I just wanted to bring up</text>
  <text start="1581.92" dur="6.22">something because I saw a Bill Mitchell</text>
  <text start="1584.39" dur="7.14">he tweeted out something and I think we</text>
  <text start="1588.14" dur="5.73">need to remember how the deep state how</text>
  <text start="1591.53" dur="4.92">the central banks have worked over the</text>
  <text start="1593.87" dur="6.78">many many years remember they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1596.45" dur="7.5">brainwashed the public into thinking a</text>

  <text start="1607.33" dur="7.33">whenever we deviate from what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1611.21" dur="6.92">been telling us they get all crazy now</text>
  <text start="1614.66" dur="5.94">this is bill Mitchell&amp;#39;s tweet being</text>
  <text start="1618.13" dur="5.68">presidential is about getting things</text>
  <text start="1620.6" dur="5.55">done for America not giving slick</text>
  <text start="1623.81" dur="5.76">speeches and saying all the polite</text>
  <text start="1626.15" dur="6.93">things being presidential means pissing</text>
  <text start="1629.57" dur="6.96">the bad guys off and inspiring the good</text>
  <text start="1633.08" dur="7.8">guys being presidential means winning</text>
  <text start="1636.53" dur="7.38">Trump is as presidential as it gets now</text>
  <text start="1640.88" dur="5.76">when you read this we need to understand</text>
  <text start="1643.91" dur="5.49">we need to remember throughout all the</text>
  <text start="1646.64" dur="5.37">different presidents they&amp;#39;ve made us</text>
  <text start="1649.4" dur="5.31">believe that oh if this president speaks</text>
  <text start="1652.01" dur="6.02">beautifully it makes an incredible</text>
  <text start="1654.71" dur="6.03">speech and is politically correct that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1658.03" dur="6.46">presidential well that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1660.74" dur="6.92">presidential if we&amp;#39;re in an economy that</text>
  <text start="1664.49" dur="6.15">has a lot of debt and we monitor</text>
  <text start="1667.66" dur="4.96">MasterCard and Visa and we show more</text>
  <text start="1670.64" dur="5.01">debt piling up that means it&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="1672.62" dur="4.8">Christmas season no that means more</text>
  <text start="1675.65" dur="4.68">people are going to debt what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1677.42" dur="6.69">done in the past is they tried to shape</text>
  <text start="1680.33" dur="5.46">us into thinking this is what it looks</text>
  <text start="1684.11" dur="3.93">like to be presidential this is what it</text>
  <text start="1685.79" dur="3.27">looks like to have a great economy this</text>
  <text start="1688.04" dur="3.45">is what it looks like</text>
  <text start="1689.06" dur="6.78">when the mainstream media puts out a</text>
  <text start="1691.49" dur="5.01">story guess what that&amp;#39;s not what it</text>
  <text start="1695.84" dur="2.88">looks like</text>
  <text start="1696.5" dur="6.45">that&amp;#39;s what they want it to look like</text>
  <text start="1698.72" dur="7.5">and everyone is now waking up to the</text>
