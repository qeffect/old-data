  <text start="235.87" dur="7.92">means crashing the economy we will do it</text>
  <text start="239.28" dur="6.19">look at the UK we&amp;#39;re seeing smoke and</text>
  <text start="243.79" dur="2.069">mirrors the same as here in the United</text>
  <text start="245.47" dur="4.23">States</text>
  <text start="245.859" dur="6.031">what is Boris Johnson trying to do he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="249.7" dur="4.2">trying to have a no deal brexit what is</text>
  <text start="251.89" dur="7.409">the establishment what is the EU trying</text>
  <text start="253.9" dur="6.839">to do they&amp;#39;re trying to stop him now we</text>
  <text start="259.299" dur="4.531">see all over the place they came out</text>
  <text start="260.739" dur="5.341">with their articles and we see that</text>
  <text start="263.83" dur="5.87">they&amp;#39;re saying that oh he must have lied</text>
  <text start="266.08" dur="7.85">to the Queen the Scottish courts are</text>
  <text start="269.7" dur="7.33">saying that he cannot go through with</text>
  <text start="273.93" dur="5.89">suspending Parliament they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="277.03" dur="5.1">whatever they possibly can but euro</text>

  <text start="284.71" dur="6.57">brexit now we discussed how Boris</text>
  <text start="288.4" dur="5.67">Johnson can send a letter and it seems</text>
  <text start="291.28" dur="5.58">that this is exactly what Boris Johnson</text>
  <text start="294.07" dur="4.27">is going to do Johnson is required by</text>
  <text start="296.86" dur="3.19">the Act to send a letter to</text>
  <text start="298.34" dur="5.01">the European Council requesting an</text>
  <text start="300.05" dur="5.88">extension until January 31st 2020 but</text>
  <text start="303.35" dur="6.24">the Act only requires that he send this</text>
  <text start="305.93" dur="6.06">letter on October 19th even then he only</text>
  <text start="309.59" dur="4.889">has to send the letter if Parliament</text>
  <text start="311.99" dur="6.12">hasn&amp;#39;t agreed to either a deal or a No</text>
  <text start="314.479" dur="5.731">Deal exit by that date both scenarios</text>
  <text start="318.11" dur="5.309">being explicitly allowed by the</text>
  <text start="320.21" dur="5.22">legislation moreover it allows Johnson</text>
  <text start="323.419" dur="4.351">to withdraw the letter if the House of</text>
  <text start="325.43" dur="5.1">Commons votes in favor of either a</text>
  <text start="327.77" dur="5.31">withdrawal agreement or a No Deal brexit</text>
  <text start="330.53" dur="5.01">between the 19th of October and the 31st</text>
  <text start="333.08" dur="6.24">of October the central bank</text>
  <text start="335.54" dur="7.77">establishment they committed a strategic</text>
  <text start="339.32" dur="6.72">error it was a mistake to leave the</text>
  <text start="343.31" dur="7.47">machinery of government in Johnson&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="346.04" dur="6.57">hands between now and October 31st he</text>
  <text start="350.78" dur="5.07">will be the only person in the room</text>
  <text start="352.61" dur="10.14">negotiating and speaking to other heads</text>
  <text start="355.85" dur="10.86">of government the establishment the</text>
  <text start="362.75" dur="6.93">central bank the EU they&amp;#39;re in trouble</text>
  <text start="366.71" dur="6.889">they know this they&amp;#39;re trying to stop</text>
  <text start="369.68" dur="7.38">Boris Johnson and the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="373.599" dur="6.19">the establishment the EU they&amp;#39;re towing</text>
  <text start="377.06" dur="5.039">everything in their power to stop him</text>
  <text start="379.789" dur="6.091">they don&amp;#39;t want this to go through</text>
  <text start="382.099" dur="8.69">because once it goes through it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="385.88" dur="9">disaster for who the central bank</text>
  <text start="390.789" dur="7.141">because people around the world in other</text>
  <text start="394.88" dur="6.75">countries they&amp;#39;re going to realize that</text>
  <text start="397.93" dur="5.65">the central bank was not good for the</text>
  <text start="401.63" dur="5.49">people it was not good for the country</text>
  <text start="403.58" dur="7.38">it didn&amp;#39;t benefit anyone except the non</text>
  <text start="407.12" dur="6.6">elected leaders and once the UK with the</text>
  <text start="410.96" dur="6.09">interim deal with the US that Trump is</text>
  <text start="413.72" dur="6.6">going to make with Boris Johnson guess</text>
  <text start="417.05" dur="6.48">what the UK is going to do very very</text>
  <text start="420.32" dur="4.5">well now in the beginning yes it might</text>
  <text start="423.53" dur="2.699">be a little tough they might have to go</text>
  <text start="424.82" dur="3.33">through bumps but whenever you</text>
  <text start="426.229" dur="4.041">transition out of something into</text>
  <text start="428.15" dur="3.3">something else there&amp;#39;s always bumps</text>
  <text start="430.27" dur="2.62">that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="431.45" dur="3.65">but they&amp;#39;re worried about yes they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="432.89" dur="4.8">play that up and say Oh see we told you</text>
  <text start="435.1" dur="4.9">what they&amp;#39;re worried about is a couple</text>
  <text start="437.69" dur="5">months down the line what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="440" dur="6.87">worried about is a year down the line</text>
  <text start="442.69" dur="6.79">this is when things get scary this is</text>
  <text start="446.87" dur="3.66">when they panic because now other</text>
  <text start="449.48" dur="2.76">countries are gonna say we&amp;#39;ll wait a</text>
  <text start="450.53" dur="5.52">minute went through a couple bumps but</text>
  <text start="452.24" dur="6.03">now the country is thriving look how</text>
  <text start="456.05" dur="6.02">great they&amp;#39;re doing they have these free</text>
  <text start="458.27" dur="8.19">trade deals they work outside of the EU</text>
  <text start="462.07" dur="8.08">this is incredible we should follow in</text>
  <text start="466.46" dur="5.94">their footsteps and guess what we can</text>
  <text start="470.15" dur="5.87">create our own currency we won&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="472.4" dur="7.11">the EU this is what they&amp;#39;re afraid of</text>
  <text start="476.02" dur="5.77">now back in the u.s. we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="479.51" dur="5.28">about how Trump controls the economic</text>
  <text start="481.79" dur="5.01">narrative remember the Fed handed him</text>
  <text start="484.79" dur="3.96">the ability to say that there is no</text>
  <text start="486.8" dur="4.98">recession in sight and the mainstream</text>
  <text start="488.75" dur="5.7">media is not going to go up against the</text>
  <text start="491.78" dur="4.05">Fed yes they might say well we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="494.45" dur="2.85">think the Fed is doing this the right</text>
  <text start="495.83" dur="2.64">way but we&amp;#39;ll go along with the Fed</text>
  <text start="497.3" dur="4.68">because they&amp;#39;re the masters of the</text>
  <text start="498.47" dur="5.99">economy and you know that Trump and the</text>
  <text start="501.98" dur="5.31">Patriots they are in complete control</text>
  <text start="504.46" dur="4.27">how do you know this well in the</text>
  <text start="507.29" dur="3.42">beginning they started put it out they</text>
  <text start="508.73" dur="3.66">started to put out all these recession</text>
  <text start="510.71" dur="4.05">articles and it was repeated on the</text>
  <text start="512.39" dur="5.22">mainstream media then they backtracked</text>
  <text start="514.76" dur="4.98">then the Fed came out and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="517.61" dur="3.93">mention recession anymore because every</text>
  <text start="519.74" dur="4.68">time Trump comes up with new numbers</text>
  <text start="521.54" dur="6.39">they look better and better the market</text>
  <text start="524.42" dur="6.99">didn&amp;#39;t crash when the Fed lowered the</text>
  <text start="527.93" dur="7.41">rate it didn&amp;#39;t plummet it wasn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="531.41" dur="6.45">disaster when the Fed cuts rates again</text>
  <text start="535.34" dur="4.2">and starts stimulus they said</text>
  <text start="537.86" dur="3.93">everything&amp;#39;s going to fall apart you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="539.54" dur="5.34">gonna see the opposite happen they know</text>
  <text start="541.79" dur="5.1">this they&amp;#39;re trying to get ahead of this</text>
  <text start="544.88" dur="5.07">and they&amp;#39;re trying to cause it but it</text>
  <text start="546.89" dur="4.95">won&amp;#39;t work and the reason why you can</text>
  <text start="549.95" dur="5.34">tell that Trump of the Patriots they are</text>
  <text start="551.84" dur="7.41">in complete control is because we had a</text>
  <text start="555.29" dur="8.91">democratic debate and the candidates the</text>
  <text start="559.25" dur="5.76">moderators they never ever mentioned the</text>
  <text start="564.2" dur="3.47">economy</text>
  <text start="565.01" dur="4.8">now during the three hour debate</text>
  <text start="567.67" dur="3.82">Democrats talked about free healthcare</text>
  <text start="569.81" dur="3.779">climate trained gun control and</text>
  <text start="571.49" dur="5.67">everything else that they want to get</text>
  <text start="573.589" dur="5.94">rid of but one topic you would think</text>
  <text start="577.16" dur="5.13">would be very important and it is very</text>
  <text start="579.529" dur="5.401">important because anyone that controls</text>
  <text start="582.29" dur="6.15">the economy anyone that can make</text>
  <text start="584.93" dur="6.019">people&amp;#39;s lives better by allowing them</text>
  <text start="588.44" dur="6.079">to get a job allowing them to keep a job</text>
  <text start="590.949" dur="6.64">allowing their investments to grow and</text>
  <text start="594.519" dur="7.57">not bringing the u.s. into a recession</text>
  <text start="597.589" dur="7.62">or a depression that person controls the</text>
  <text start="602.089" dur="6.091">economy that&amp;#39;s what Trump is doing right</text>
  <text start="605.209" dur="5.401">now and they know they can&amp;#39;t go up</text>
  <text start="608.18" dur="4.56">against this because what are they gonna</text>
  <text start="610.61" dur="4.919">say they&amp;#39;re gonna say we&amp;#39;re gonna make</text>
  <text start="612.74" dur="4.89">it better than it is today what are they</text>
  <text start="615.529" dur="5.731">going to do to improve it I mean look</text>
  <text start="617.63" dur="5.639">what happened when Trump cut taxes they</text>
  <text start="621.26" dur="3.72">tried to put out stories that this</text>
  <text start="623.269" dur="3.661">wasn&amp;#39;t really happening and it was</text>
  <text start="624.98" dur="4.229">actually hurting people and people</text>
  <text start="626.93" dur="5.219">weren&amp;#39;t getting the tax cuts which was</text>
  <text start="629.209" dur="6.87">fake phony and false for those people</text>
  <text start="632.149" dur="6.091">that own businesses they saw them I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="636.079" dur="5.661">been in touch with many people and they</text>
  <text start="638.24" dur="6.149">said oh yeah we saw it and guess what</text>
  <text start="641.74" dur="3.88">Trump knows he needs to keep this</text>
  <text start="644.389" dur="4.621">economy going</text>
  <text start="645.62" dur="6.06">he understands the only way to keep it</text>
  <text start="649.01" dur="6.66">going is to cut rates to add stimulus</text>
  <text start="651.68" dur="7.709">and to put more money in the pockets of</text>
  <text start="655.67" dur="8.539">the everyday person why does he need to</text>
  <text start="659.389" dur="9.781">do this because 70 percent of GDP is</text>
  <text start="664.209" dur="8.07">spending so how do you give people more</text>
  <text start="669.17" dur="7.14">money to spend or to feel good about</text>
  <text start="672.279" dur="7.42">their household can you force a raise</text>
  <text start="676.31" dur="5.25">and give them a raise no can you just</text>
  <text start="679.699" dur="4.291">create currency and just throw it at</text>
  <text start="681.56" dur="3.6">them no but even though the central bank</text>
  <text start="683.99" dur="3.69">does want to do that it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="685.16" dur="5.1">helicopter money and we know that the</text>
  <text start="687.68" dur="7.589">deep state the Dems they&amp;#39;re all for that</text>
  <text start="690.26" dur="7.889">but right now how do you get more money</text>

  <text start="740.18" dur="4.86">to use it and he&amp;#39;s gonna take this</text>
  <text start="742.88" dur="4.35">economy and he&amp;#39;s gonna put it over the</text>
  <text start="745.04" dur="4.02">edge and I don&amp;#39;t mean to collapse I mean</text>
  <text start="747.23" dur="4.62">he&amp;#39;s gonna bring it to Heights that</text>
  <text start="749.06" dur="6.63">we&amp;#39;ve never seen before where people</text>
  <text start="751.85" dur="5.85">feel incredible now remember this is all</text>
  <text start="755.69" dur="4.35">smoke and mirrors but he has to do it</text>
  <text start="757.7" dur="6.9">because this is a central bank smoke and</text>
  <text start="760.04" dur="8.16">mirrors economy but he&amp;#39;s going to do</text>
  <text start="764.6" dur="10.08">this in 2020 he said he will unveil a</text>
  <text start="768.2" dur="9.29">middle income tax plan in 2020 and this</text>
  <text start="774.68" dur="4.98">is control</text>
  <text start="777.49" dur="3.84">because once he does that and remember</text>
  <text start="779.66" dur="5.43">timing is everything</text>
  <text start="781.33" dur="8.17">he&amp;#39;s waiting until 2020 why oh it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="785.09" dur="7.74">elections timing is very important think</text>
  <text start="789.5" dur="7.86">about it the tax period is gonna be</text>
  <text start="792.83" dur="7.56">coming up in April of 2020 he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="797.36" dur="6">propose a tax cut hopefully he can get</text>
  <text start="800.39" dur="7.47">it in before that period so people will</text>
  <text start="803.36" dur="7.4">feel it if people feel it they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="807.86" dur="5.91">feel good who are they gonna vote for</text>
  <text start="810.76" dur="5.92">well he kept the economy up you have</text>
  <text start="813.77" dur="5.22">more money in your pocket well people</text>
  <text start="816.68" dur="3.69">like that my investments are still there</text>
  <text start="818.99" dur="3.78">the stock market&amp;#39;s going higher and</text>
  <text start="820.37" dur="5.07">higher which means my investments are ok</text>
  <text start="822.77" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re safe even though we even though</text>
  <text start="825.44" dur="6.43">we know they&amp;#39;re never safe but people</text>
  <text start="827.54" dur="5.92">will feel this and he needs to do this</text>
  <text start="831.87" dur="4.59">because he needs to keep the system</text>
  <text start="833.46" dur="5.88">going long enough to move to the next</text>
  <text start="836.46" dur="5.78">phase and that is removing the central</text>
  <text start="839.34" dur="6.68">bank and that is where we are headed</text>
  <text start="842.24" dur="7.81">remember what he&amp;#39;s doing he&amp;#39;s recreating</text>
  <text start="846.02" dur="7.42">the entire economic system</text>
  <text start="850.05" dur="5.43">piece by piece yes it would be great if</text>
  <text start="853.44" dur="4.74">we could do it all at once but we know</text>
  <text start="855.48" dur="4.74">there are certain blocks we know there</text>
  <text start="858.18" dur="3.72">are certain individuals that won&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="860.22" dur="4.2">this to happen look what happened when</text>
  <text start="861.9" dur="4.35">he tried to get rid of Obamacare for</text>
  <text start="864.42" dur="4.41">instance remember Obamacare that was a</text>
  <text start="866.25" dur="5.22">drain on people premiums continually</text>
  <text start="868.83" dur="3.99">went higher and higher and people had</text>
  <text start="871.47" dur="3.45">less to spend and they were just</text>
  <text start="872.82" dur="4.47">spending it on insurance this was not</text>
  <text start="874.92" dur="5.49">affordable at all most of the middle</text>
  <text start="877.29" dur="7.5">class who had their own businesses they</text>
  <text start="880.41" dur="7.38">paid a fortune for health care yes for</text>
  <text start="884.79" dur="6.51">the poor they got subsidized but</text>
  <text start="887.79" dur="6.27">remember the population as a whole</text>
  <text start="891.3" dur="5.7">that system cannot be sustained that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="894.06" dur="5.43">why it was collapsing that&amp;#39;s why the</text>
  <text start="897" dur="4.83">exchanges were going bankrupt left and</text>
  <text start="899.49" dur="4.59">right and this was enduring Trump&amp;#39;s term</text>
  <text start="901.83" dur="5.46">this was during Obama&amp;#39;s term that the</text>
  <text start="904.08" dur="6.87">exchanges were going bankrupt and we</text>
  <text start="907.29" dur="7.8">reported on that very often during this</text>
  <text start="910.95" dur="6.93">entire period of time but you have to</text>
  <text start="915.09" dur="5.01">remember if Trump could do it all he</text>
  <text start="917.88" dur="4.14">would do it all but there are certain</text>
  <text start="920.1" dur="5.25">blocks that they have to get rid of</text>
  <text start="922.02" dur="5.79">first and what they do is they tackle</text>
  <text start="925.35" dur="4.77">this problem they they fix that problem</text>
  <text start="927.81" dur="4.59">they go after the next problem block</text>
  <text start="930.12" dur="4.05">they go after another problem fix it</text>
  <text start="932.4" dur="4.83">come back to the block get rid of that</text>
  <text start="934.17" dur="5.13">block fix that problem this is how</text>
  <text start="937.23" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;ve been working and Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="939.3" dur="5.22">this with the economy this is why he</text>
  <text start="942.84" dur="3.18">changed NAFTA I think eventually what</text>
  <text start="944.52" dur="3.75">he&amp;#39;s going to do he&amp;#39;s just gonna scrap</text>
  <text start="946.02" dur="4.65">the whole thing but it was so tied up</text>
  <text start="948.27" dur="4.26">with Congress that he could only make</text>
  <text start="950.67" dur="4.71">changes and I believe what he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="952.53" dur="5.13">do eventually is completely get out of</text>
  <text start="955.38" dur="4.95">it because he wants something completely</text>
  <text start="957.66" dur="4.92">different just like he&amp;#39;s making the</text>
  <text start="960.33" dur="6.15">deals around the world</text>
  <text start="962.58" dur="6.629">and what he&amp;#39;s doing he&amp;#39;s recreating this</text>
  <text start="966.48" dur="5.49">economic system a new economic system</text>
  <text start="969.209" dur="5.491">that will work in the benefit of the</text>
  <text start="971.97" dur="4.65">people here in the United States not for</text>
  <text start="974.7" dur="5.73">the benefit of the globalist of the</text>
  <text start="976.62" dur="5.64">central bank of the elite that&amp;#39;s the big</text>
  <text start="980.43" dur="4.95">difference and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="982.26" dur="6.17">trying to stop him at every turn because</text>
  <text start="985.38" dur="6.72">he&amp;#39;s undoing what they have</text>
  <text start="988.43" dur="6.19">remember what when he does this he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="992.1" dur="6.479">affecting the way these people make</text>
  <text start="994.62" dur="6.36">money they have the inside track they</text>
  <text start="998.579" dur="5.521">know how the system works and they have</text>
  <text start="1000.98" dur="7.109">inside information when he removes all</text>
  <text start="1004.1" dur="7.32">this what happens to these people they</text>
  <text start="1008.089" dur="5.521">lose the inside track they lose the</text>
  <text start="1011.42" dur="6.359">ability to speculate they lose the</text>
  <text start="1013.61" dur="7.229">ability to do all of this that&amp;#39;s why he</text>
  <text start="1017.779" dur="4.5">is a threat to them listen everyone</text>
