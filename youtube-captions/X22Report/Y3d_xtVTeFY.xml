  <text start="93.25" dur="8.38">retail sales and sales of our products</text>
  <text start="98.45" dur="4.94">continually decline now of course they</text>
  <text start="101.63" dur="4.86">can&amp;#39;t blame this on the weather anymore</text>
  <text start="103.39" dur="5.339">the only thing left at this point is</text>
  <text start="106.49" dur="7.879">this something wrong with the economy I</text>
  <text start="108.729" dur="9.64">mean if we look at the middle class and</text>
  <text start="114.369" dur="6.43">how much they&amp;#39;re earning it has fallen</text>
  <text start="118.369" dur="5.671">to forty three percent from fifty five</text>
  <text start="120.799" dur="5.46">percent since the 1970s and those</text>
  <text start="124.04" dur="6.3">households in the middle tier haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="126.259" dur="6.961">gotten a raise since 1999 after</text>
  <text start="130.34" dur="7.77">adjusting for inflation us meeting</text>
  <text start="133.22" dur="9.87">household income is around 50 3657 in</text>
  <text start="138.11" dur="7.83">2014 it is six point five percent lower</text>
  <text start="143.09" dur="5.429">than pre-recession levels in 2000 see</text>
  <text start="145.94" dur="5.82">two thousand seven and seven point two</text>
  <text start="148.519" dur="5.071">percent lower than its peak in 1999 and</text>
  <text start="151.76" dur="6.87">this is according to the US census</text>
  <text start="153.59" dur="8.01">bureau and all these people that are</text>
  <text start="158.63" dur="6.06">being laid off right now they are having</text>
  <text start="161.6" dur="8.28">a very very difficult time finding</text>
  <text start="164.69" dur="7.44">a job now I&amp;#39;m talking about the job that</text>
  <text start="169.88" dur="6.48">they had before finding something that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="172.13" dur="6.54">equivalent or better going from a sixty</text>
  <text start="176.36" dur="5.63">seventy eighty ninety a hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="178.67" dur="8.94">dollar job to a part-time position is</text>
  <text start="181.99" dur="7.33">not the same thing going from sixty</text>
  <text start="187.61" dur="6.15">seventy eighty ninety thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="189.32" dur="6.86">to 30,000 it is not the same thing so</text>
  <text start="193.76" dur="6.99">when I say job I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="196.18" dur="7.06">equivalent or better now there was a</text>
  <text start="200.75" dur="4.8">time that you could do this but at this</text>
  <text start="203.24" dur="4.35">point in time it is getting more and</text>
  <text start="205.55" dur="7.53">more difficult and people are being laid</text>
  <text start="207.59" dur="7.29">off by the thousands and where again are</text>
  <text start="213.08" dur="2.88">they supposed to find this work and this</text>
  <text start="214.88" dur="2.9">is why they have to continually</text>
  <text start="215.96" dur="4.05">manipulate the unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="217.78" dur="5.35">because there&amp;#39;s no other way to explain</text>
  <text start="220.01" dur="4.8">it except to say yeah they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="223.13" dur="3.42">work so we&amp;#39;re just going to remove them</text>
  <text start="224.81" dur="3.6">and if you notice that number</text>
  <text start="226.55" dur="3.81">continually Rises and they keep saying</text>
  <text start="228.41" dur="4.829">oh yeah more you know hundreds of</text>
  <text start="230.36" dur="5.19">thousands of people fell off our</text>
  <text start="233.239" dur="4.441">statistical numbers which we calculate</text>
  <text start="235.55" dur="3.09">and it&amp;#39;s they don&amp;#39;t want anything they</text>
  <text start="237.68" dur="3.09">don&amp;#39;t want to provide for the family</text>
  <text start="238.64" dur="3.93">they don&amp;#39;t want health benefits they</text>
  <text start="240.77" dur="4.86">don&amp;#39;t want to have funds where they can</text>
  <text start="242.57" dur="5.43">go on vacation pay for their home pay</text>
  <text start="245.63" dur="6.06">for their cars they don&amp;#39;t want any of</text>
  <text start="248" dur="6.3">that which is absolutely ridiculous now</text>
  <text start="251.69" dur="4.29">as we go further into this year actually</text>
  <text start="254.3" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;re coming up to the end of this year</text>
  <text start="255.98" dur="7.68">we see from the beginning to now the</text>
  <text start="258.62" dur="9.75">economy is a complete disaster I mean</text>
  <text start="263.66" dur="9.84">factory orders have fallen for 11 months</text>
  <text start="268.37" dur="8.64">in a row I mean this is absolutely awful</text>
  <text start="273.5" dur="5.97">and the most recent drop was negative</text>
  <text start="277.01" dur="4.92">six point nine percent something which</text>
  <text start="279.47" dur="5.22">has not happened outside a recession in</text>
  <text start="281.93" dur="4.59">history in fact adjusting for the</text>
  <text start="284.69" dur="4.02">one-off Boeing surge that we had back in</text>
  <text start="286.52" dur="6.09">July of 2014 this is the biggest</text>
  <text start="288.71" dur="7.459">year-on-year drop since 2008 and we all</text>
  <text start="292.61" dur="5.91">know what happened in October of 2008 I</text>
  <text start="296.169" dur="6.011">mean factory orders fell to</text>
  <text start="298.52" dur="6.72">point one percent in August revised from</text>
  <text start="302.18" dur="5.28">the one point seven percent drop so they</text>
  <text start="305.24" dur="6.989">already are going back and revising the</text>
  <text start="307.46" dur="6.48">numbers and this does make sense as we</text>
  <text start="312.229" dur="7.201">see more and more people being laid off</text>
  <text start="313.94" dur="10.37">and they can&amp;#39;t find jobs they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="319.43" dur="7.35">bringing in income we&amp;#39;re seeing retail</text>
  <text start="324.31" dur="4.78">continually decline which mean which</text>
  <text start="326.78" dur="5.729">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing even though they tell</text>
  <text start="329.09" dur="5.91">us the unemployment is going down we</text>
  <text start="332.509" dur="4.621">should see retail sales going up but</text>
  <text start="335" dur="4.62">actually we see retails heading in the</text>
  <text start="337.13" dur="5.3">same direction as the unemployment</text>
  <text start="339.62" dur="4.829">numbers which is kind of strange because</text>
  <text start="342.43" dur="4.479">what the government is trying to tell us</text>
  <text start="344.449" dur="5.19">is that everyone is working everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="346.909" dur="7.621">making an income but no one wants to buy</text>
  <text start="349.639" dur="6.451">anything and the reason for this is</text>
  <text start="354.53" dur="4.53">because they&amp;#39;re not making the same</text>
  <text start="356.09" dur="5.96">income if they found a part-time job if</text>
  <text start="359.06" dur="5.909">they found no job there is no income and</text>
  <text start="362.05" dur="5.89">we can see by the raw materials which is</text>
  <text start="364.969" dur="6.211">used to create the products this is</text>
  <text start="367.94" dur="6.479">continually dropping I mean right now</text>
  <text start="371.18" dur="7.47">the Baltic Dry Index fell to 680 points</text>
  <text start="374.419" dur="9.3">down another 26 points it is a complete</text>
  <text start="378.65" dur="8.43">disaster now of course the stock market</text>
  <text start="383.719" dur="4.98">is continually rising because we know</text>
  <text start="387.08" dur="2.79">the US government central bankers they</text>
  <text start="388.699" dur="2.071">have control over this they can</text>
  <text start="389.87" dur="2.519">manipulate this they have the</text>
  <text start="390.77" dur="4.019">high-frequency trading the plunge</text>
  <text start="392.389" dur="5.701">protection team and they can keep this</text>
  <text start="394.789" dur="6.651">baby going all night long and all day</text>
  <text start="398.09" dur="6.6">long and keep it up in the positive area</text>
  <text start="401.44" dur="4.81">until that one black swan or event</text>
  <text start="404.69" dur="3.479">occurs for the whole thing just</text>
  <text start="406.25" dur="5.639">completely falls apart and no matter how</text>
  <text start="408.169" dur="7.171">much money they print or create they</text>
  <text start="411.889" dur="5.881">can&amp;#39;t push the market up but everything</text>
  <text start="415.34" dur="6.389">around the market is completely falling</text>
  <text start="417.77" dur="7.59">apart and if we go back in time we have</text>
  <text start="421.729" dur="6.901">to remember the biggest bank in the</text>
  <text start="425.36" dur="4.97">Western world HSBC they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="428.63" dur="3.84">saying we&amp;#39;re in a dollar recession</text>

  <text start="459.77" dur="6.12">air inside the United States guess what</text>
  <text start="462.11" dur="8.07">it&amp;#39;s been falling every single month on</text>
  <text start="465.89" dur="7.11">a year-over-year basis so if less stuff</text>

  <text start="540.98" dur="5.76">seen layoffs like this since 2009 and</text>
  <text start="543.589" dur="5.791">actually we&amp;#39;re very very close to the</text>
  <text start="546.74" dur="5.49">amount of people laid off back in 2009</text>
  <text start="549.38" dur="4.47">what does that tell you and the number</text>
  <text start="552.23" dur="5.43">of job openings in the United States is</text>
  <text start="553.85" dur="5.52">continually declining I mean just in</text>
  <text start="557.66" dur="6.48">August they&amp;#39;ve declined by five point</text>
  <text start="559.37" dur="6.719">three percent one of the largest plunges</text>
  <text start="564.14" dur="4.559">for a month</text>
  <text start="566.089" dur="7.201">so this system that we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="568.699" dur="7.14">right now it is slowly dying and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="573.29" dur="6.51">reaching the point right now that we</text>
  <text start="575.839" dur="8.401">just hit rock bottom and there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="579.8" dur="5.639">out of this the Fed just can&amp;#39;t create</text>
  <text start="584.24" dur="5.13">more money that&amp;#39;s not going to create</text>
  <text start="585.439" dur="7.77">jobs I mean we have a connect a case</text>
  <text start="589.37" dur="5.459">scenario in Greece give them money give</text>
  <text start="593.209" dur="3.091">them currency give them currency give</text>
  <text start="594.829" dur="4.05">them currency put them into debt put</text>
  <text start="596.3" dur="7.289">them into debt where does it leave the</text>
  <text start="598.879" dur="7.981">country more debt less jobs collapse of</text>
  <text start="603.589" dur="5.43">the system sell off all the assets that</text>
  <text start="606.86" dur="5.94">the country has just to pay the debt and</text>
  <text start="609.019" dur="5.73">where the people the people are left out</text>
  <text start="612.8" dur="5.159">in the street this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="614.749" dur="4.621">right now so of course the United States</text>
  <text start="617.959" dur="4.44">government central bankers they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="619.37" dur="5.339">whatever they possibly can to bring in</text>
  <text start="622.399" dur="5.461">as much as they possibly can to take</text>
  <text start="624.709" dur="6.451">from the people it reminds me back in</text>
  <text start="627.86" dur="7.769">the day when we had kings and queens and</text>
  <text start="631.16" dur="8.58">they continually say well we have no</text>
  <text start="635.629" dur="6.031">gold we have no funds for the war tax</text>
  <text start="639.74" dur="3.48">the people again and they would say well</text>
  <text start="641.66" dur="4.049">that people have nothing left less</text>
  <text start="643.22" dur="6.869">nothing left to give it doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="645.709" dur="7.951">hit him again and you know what happens</text>
  <text start="650.089" dur="6.75">in the end the people can&amp;#39;t take it</text>
  <text start="653.66" dur="5.64">anymore and normally they storm the</text>
  <text start="656.839" dur="4.951">castle they behead the quaint the king</text>
  <text start="659.3" dur="6.479">and the Queen they say we&amp;#39;ve had enough</text>
  <text start="661.79" dur="7.859">of this and we&amp;#39;re heading down this path</text>
  <text start="665.779" dur="6.54">am I saying to do this no but we are</text>
  <text start="669.649" dur="4.461">heading down this path where the people</text>
  <text start="672.319" dur="5.221">are going to say you know something</text>
  <text start="674.11" dur="6.969">we&amp;#39;re done with this now has everyone</text>
  <text start="677.54" dur="5.609">felt this at this point no we&amp;#39;ve had the</text>
  <text start="681.079" dur="6.81">first group back in two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="683.149" dur="9.201">who really felt the Great Recession now</text>
  <text start="687.889" dur="9.361">for a lot of people it never went away</text>
  <text start="692.35" dur="7.45">it got worse they most people couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="697.25" dur="6.089">recover they lost a lot of their wealth</text>
  <text start="699.8" dur="5.64">and for other people they were lucky</text>
  <text start="703.339" dur="5">enough to keep their jobs they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="705.44" dur="6.48">chugging along like nothing&amp;#39;s wrong and</text>
  <text start="708.339" dur="6.761">here we are in the second wave where</text>
  <text start="711.92" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re going to experience what people</text>
  <text start="715.1" dur="3.6">fell in two thousand eight and this is</text>
  <text start="716.66" dur="4.29">going to bring a lot more people into</text>
  <text start="718.7" dur="5.94">the fold and this is where the problem</text>
  <text start="720.95" dur="6.509">is going to be because they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="724.64" dur="4.65">get a rude awakening of what it feels</text>
  <text start="727.459" dur="5.041">like to lose a job and can&amp;#39;t get one</text>
  <text start="729.29" dur="7.44">then to lose your home to lose your</text>
  <text start="732.5" dur="6.42">wealth and a lot of people are not going</text>

  <text start="808.94" dur="6.389">they say and if we believe what they say</text>
  <text start="811.39" dur="6.16">then what they need to do is let people</text>

  <text start="817.55" dur="5.25">to reproduce whatever they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="819.44" dur="5.67">over and over and over again instead of</text>
  <text start="822.8" dur="4.77">them telling us that the science is</text>
  <text start="825.11" dur="4.53">settled normally when people say that</text>
  <text start="827.57" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;re in the wrong and</text>
  <text start="829.64" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re hiding something if you have the</text>
  <text start="832.19" dur="3.75">truth behind you</text>

  <text start="835.94" dur="5.36">give the people the data you would let</text>
  <text start="838.37" dur="5.7">them run the experiments over and over</text>
  <text start="841.3" dur="5.289">because there&amp;#39;s nothing to hide when you</text>

  <text start="855.23" dur="3.87">they only see what they want and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="856.76" dur="6.15">it and if you question it there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="859.1" dur="6.57">problem I remember back hundreds and</text>
  <text start="862.91" dur="5.729">hundreds of years ago if you questioned</text>
  <text start="865.67" dur="6.24">if the earth was flat if you questioned</text>

  <text start="874.31" dur="4.2">prison for a very long time it seems</text>
  <text start="876.889" dur="5.06">like we&amp;#39;re heading down that path once</text>
  <text start="878.51" dur="8.069">again but there was a new poll that was</text>
  <text start="881.949" dur="8.26">created and this is an AP poll that</text>
  <text start="886.579" dur="7.26">Americans right now are not bothered by</text>
  <text start="890.209" dur="6.18">global warming most Americans know the</text>

  <text start="896.389" dur="5.851">they&amp;#39;re just not that worried about it</text>
  <text start="898.13" dur="5.31">and they aren&amp;#39;t worried about it because</text>
  <text start="902.24" dur="3.349">a lot of people are starting to wake up</text>
  <text start="903.44" dur="4.53">and starting to realize wait a minute</text>
  <text start="905.589" dur="4.421">why are we getting more and more snow</text>
  <text start="907.97" dur="5.91">why is it getting colder and colder out</text>
  <text start="910.01" dur="5.28">if we&amp;#39;re supposedly in this global</text>
  <text start="913.88" dur="4.35">warming where the earth is heating up</text>
  <text start="915.29" dur="6.83">and why is it such a problem where these</text>
  <text start="918.23" dur="7.44">people don&amp;#39;t want to give the raw data</text>
  <text start="922.12" dur="6.909">to reproduce all the experiments they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="925.67" dur="6.479">been doing remember the main objective</text>
  <text start="929.029" dur="7.981">of our government is to lie to the</text>
  <text start="932.149" dur="5.971">people well really it&amp;#39;s supposed to but</text>
  <text start="937.01" dur="2.819">really what the government supposed to</text>
  <text start="938.12" dur="4.829">do is it supposed to support the people</text>

  <text start="942.949" dur="4.051">they&amp;#39;re supposed to do things that</text>
  <text start="944.81" dur="3.509">benefit the people but our government</text>
  <text start="947" dur="4.8">and governments around the world are</text>
  <text start="948.319" dur="5.671">doing the opposite their main focus is</text>
  <text start="951.8" dur="6.12">lying and getting as much as they</text>
  <text start="953.99" dur="8.36">possibly can from you this is what they</text>
  <text start="957.92" dur="6.57">are doing now we know Obama is</text>
