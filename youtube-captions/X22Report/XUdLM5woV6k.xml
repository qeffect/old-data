  <text start="183.23" dur="4.11">because we know this economy is based on</text>
  <text start="185.84" dur="4.74">an illusion so</text>
  <text start="187.34" dur="6.72">Obama is taking credit for an illusion</text>
  <text start="190.58" dur="5.879">that he created with the help of course</text>
  <text start="194.06" dur="4.14">the central bank and others and they</text>
  <text start="196.459" dur="4.321">kept it going now</text>
  <text start="198.2" dur="5.789">Trump and those working with him they</text>
  <text start="200.78" dur="5.01">are using the same manipulation actually</text>
  <text start="203.989" dur="3.991">they manipulated a little bit further to</text>
  <text start="205.79" dur="4.259">really get the economy looking fantastic</text>
  <text start="207.98" dur="3.149">and remember this is all statistical</text>
  <text start="210.049" dur="3.121">numbers when you start breaking it down</text>
  <text start="211.129" dur="3.841">and you start looking at you know the</text>
  <text start="213.17" dur="3.33">GDP numbers which was shifted by a</text>
  <text start="214.97" dur="4.019">trillion dollars and you start looking</text>
  <text start="216.5" dur="3.87">at unemployment when you start you know</text>
  <text start="218.989" dur="3.481">you don&amp;#39;t take those people that are</text>
  <text start="220.37" dur="4.11">falling off you don&amp;#39;t count them the</text>
  <text start="222.47" dur="3.84">unemployment numbers come down when you</text>
  <text start="224.48" dur="3.9">look at the stock market you know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="226.31" dur="4.38">completely manipulated yes when you look</text>
  <text start="228.38" dur="5.4">at all the statistical information the</text>
  <text start="230.69" dur="4.92">economy is doing fantastically but when</text>
  <text start="233.78" dur="3.45">you really look at the population and</text>
  <text start="235.61" dur="2.969">how they&amp;#39;re doing and you look at the</text>
  <text start="237.23" dur="3.24">empty factories and you look at the</text>
  <text start="238.579" dur="4.651">factories that not that have not yet</text>
  <text start="240.47" dur="4.47">come back here to United States it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="243.23" dur="3.69">completely different story when you look</text>
  <text start="244.94" dur="3.75">at the retail stores and how many are</text>
  <text start="246.92" dur="3.289">going on a business not just the brick</text>
  <text start="248.69" dur="4.379">and mortars but their online</text>
  <text start="250.209" dur="4.481">counterparts you see that these stores</text>
  <text start="253.069" dur="3.72">are not doing well they have to declare</text>
  <text start="254.69" dur="3.539">bankruptcy they&amp;#39;re not closing the</text>
  <text start="256.789" dur="3.211">stores and saying you know something</text>
  <text start="258.229" dur="3.391">we&amp;#39;re doing fantastically on the</text>
  <text start="260" dur="3.45">internet side and that&amp;#39;s making that in</text>
  <text start="261.62" dur="4.08">the entire difference that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="263.45" dur="4.32">happening when you start to look at</text>
  <text start="265.7" dur="3.899">people and how much they&amp;#39;re making and</text>
  <text start="267.77" dur="5.34">what jobs they&amp;#39;re getting it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="269.599" dur="6.271">completely different story but what has</text>
  <text start="273.11" dur="5.91">to be done here is the illusion has to</text>
  <text start="275.87" dur="6.9">be kept alive and the reason for this is</text>
  <text start="279.02" dur="6.06">because when the system comes down you</text>
  <text start="282.77" dur="5.1">need to show the world that the economy</text>
  <text start="285.08" dur="5.28">is fine and the central bankers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="287.87" dur="6.03">the ones who brought this entire system</text>
  <text start="290.36" dur="7.559">down now we did mention that Sweden&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="293.9" dur="7.26">most influential family the Wallenberg&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="297.919" dur="6.541">in Sweden they are getting ready for the</text>
  <text start="301.16" dur="6.03">next economic crisis one of China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="304.46" dur="6.47">largest funds is getting ready to dump</text>
  <text start="307.19" dur="6.72">stocks and they&amp;#39;re getting ready to</text>
  <text start="310.93" dur="6.46">protect themselves against the next</text>
  <text start="313.91" dur="6.569">crisis now one of China&amp;#39;s largest state</text>
  <text start="317.39" dur="3.97">backed asset manager which runs about 18</text>
  <text start="320.479" dur="3.761">billion</text>
  <text start="321.36" dur="5.85">and which said it was preparing to sell</text>
  <text start="324.24" dur="5.85">shares in as many as 30 stocks on</text>
  <text start="327.21" dur="5.91">concern that the valuations worldwide</text>
  <text start="330.09" dur="6.06">have peaked so there are 20 to 30</text>
  <text start="333.12" dur="5.789">companies in China ever brights global</text>
  <text start="336.15" dur="4.53">portfolio that are ripe for exit after</text>
  <text start="338.909" dur="4.651">they went through the initial public</text>
  <text start="340.68" dur="6.359">offerings and they&amp;#39;re getting out of</text>
  <text start="343.56" dur="6.06">them and many other stocks so we have</text>
  <text start="347.039" dur="5.28">Sweden&amp;#39;s family the Wallenberg&amp;#39;s we have</text>
  <text start="349.62" dur="4.799">one of China&amp;#39;s largest funds they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="352.319" dur="4.801">getting ready for the next economic</text>
  <text start="354.419" dur="5.49">crisis and I think at this point we</text>
  <text start="357.12" dur="6.57">realize that there&amp;#39;s going to be another</text>
  <text start="359.909" dur="6.54">crisis do we know the exact date no but</text>
  <text start="363.69" dur="5.64">we know there&amp;#39;s going to be one and we</text>
  <text start="366.449" dur="4.141">know that there are two sides that are</text>
  <text start="369.33" dur="2.429">going to try to control the narrative</text>
  <text start="370.59" dur="3.419">we&amp;#39;ve been saying this for a very long</text>
  <text start="371.759" dur="4.681">time and Trump has been speaking out</text>
  <text start="374.009" dur="5.28">against the Fed more and more so as time</text>
  <text start="376.44" dur="4.77">goes on here because he&amp;#39;s preparing the</text>
  <text start="379.289" dur="3.241">narrative to blame this all on the</text>
  <text start="381.21" dur="4.17">central bank and this is why he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="382.53" dur="4.68">propping up the economy using the</text>
  <text start="385.38" dur="3.029">manipulation tactics that the central</text>
  <text start="387.21" dur="3.359">bank the deep state used in the past</text>
  <text start="388.409" dur="3.841">they&amp;#39;re using them now of course Obama</text>
  <text start="390.569" dur="3.69">is trying to get in on this of course</text>
  <text start="392.25" dur="3.9">for the elections trying to say hey</text>
  <text start="394.259" dur="4.38">don&amp;#39;t forget who started the recovery I</text>
  <text start="396.15" dur="7.769">mean started the manipulation to fool</text>
  <text start="398.639" dur="10.041">the public but the entire plan the</text>
  <text start="403.919" dur="8.911">entire strategy in all of this is to</text>
  <text start="408.68" dur="6.669">bring back manufacturing to the United</text>
  <text start="412.83" dur="5.519">States and we need to understand that</text>
  <text start="415.349" dur="6.451">over time the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="418.349" dur="6.991">banks they were moving manufacturing out</text>
  <text start="421.8" dur="7.41">of the United States corporations were</text>
  <text start="425.34" dur="6.24">moving their headquarters their base of</text>
  <text start="429.21" dur="4.29">operations out of the United States now</text>
  <text start="431.58" dur="3.869">of course they moved them into</text>
  <text start="433.5" dur="4.65">developing countries China was a</text>
  <text start="435.449" dur="4.261">developing country their labour costs</text>
  <text start="438.15" dur="4.139">were the lowest in the world</text>
  <text start="439.71" dur="4.919">it also offered massive subsidies and</text>
  <text start="442.289" dur="5.91">readily turned a blind eye to labor</text>
  <text start="444.629" dur="5.46">abuse and environmental degradation but</text>
  <text start="448.199" dur="3.75">the plan of the deep plate in the</text>
  <text start="450.089" dur="4.44">central bankers and what they were doing</text>
  <text start="451.949" dur="3.241">behind the scenes they were trying to</text>
  <text start="454.529" dur="3.511">reduce the</text>
  <text start="455.19" dur="4.98">to a third-world country trying to make</text>
  <text start="458.04" dur="4.35">it so they didn&amp;#39;t have a military try to</text>
  <text start="460.17" dur="3.99">make it so they couldn&amp;#39;t win a war once</text>
  <text start="462.39" dur="3.84">a war broke out because this was part of</text>
  <text start="464.16" dur="4.53">the plan trying to bring the United</text>
  <text start="466.23" dur="6.03">States down to the level of every other</text>
  <text start="468.69" dur="6.48">country and this plan was set into</text>
  <text start="472.26" dur="4.65">motion a very long time ago and what the</text>
  <text start="475.17" dur="4.89">central bank&amp;#39;s what the deep state have</text>
  <text start="476.91" dur="6.33">done over this time is they slowly moved</text>
  <text start="480.06" dur="5.22">out the manufacturing the companies and</text>
  <text start="483.24" dur="4.53">everything else from this country and</text>
  <text start="485.28" dur="3.93">they did it very very slowly so no one</text>
  <text start="487.77" dur="2.7">really noticed that yes you heard news</text>
  <text start="489.21" dur="1.74">reports that the middle class would be</text>
  <text start="490.47" dur="2.79">gone</text>
  <text start="490.95" dur="4.56">that manufacturing is moving off but no</text>
  <text start="493.26" dur="4.47">one really said hey we should stop this</text>
  <text start="495.51" dur="4.02">maybe we shouldn&amp;#39;t be doing this because</text>
  <text start="497.73" dur="3.21">all they saw was one company here a</text>
  <text start="499.53" dur="3.45">couple of years later another company</text>
  <text start="500.94" dur="3.75">there and they didn&amp;#39;t really recognize</text>
  <text start="502.98" dur="4.05">that this was happening all over the</text>
  <text start="504.69" dur="4.41">place and they did this on purpose and</text>
  <text start="507.03" dur="5.129">in this manner so no one would really</text>
  <text start="509.1" dur="7.65">catch on and understand what the</text>
  <text start="512.159" dur="8.281">ultimate goal was and today China is the</text>
  <text start="516.75" dur="5.969">world&amp;#39;s second largest economy it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="520.44" dur="4.02">labor real estate energy costs have</text>
  <text start="522.719" dur="4.681">increased so much that they are</text>
  <text start="524.46" dur="6.75">comparable to those in some parts of the</text>
  <text start="527.4" dur="5.94">United States by 2014 China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="531.21" dur="6.57">manufacturing caused advantage over the</text>
  <text start="533.34" dur="7.23">US had shrunk to less than 5% add to</text>
  <text start="537.78" dur="5.19">that the intellectual property theft and</text>
  <text start="540.57" dur="5.97">unfair trade practices that China has</text>
  <text start="542.97" dur="5.7">engaged in and it becomes clear why it</text>
  <text start="546.54" dur="5.79">makes sense for companies to bring</text>
  <text start="548.67" dur="5.36">manufacturing back to America so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="552.33" dur="5.63">think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="554.03" dur="8.23">China has been built up over time</text>
  <text start="557.96" dur="6.37">they&amp;#39;ve been stealing information</text>
  <text start="562.26" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;ve been stealing information from</text>
  <text start="564.33" dur="5.009">corporations they&amp;#39;ve been stealing</text>
  <text start="566.43" dur="4.17">information from the government here in</text>
  <text start="569.339" dur="4.081">the United States or maybe I shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="570.6" dur="6.78">say steal they were sold this</text>
  <text start="573.42" dur="8.49">information they were sold all of this</text>
  <text start="577.38" dur="6.51">and over the many years the deep state</text>
  <text start="581.91" dur="5.67">the central bankers they were able to</text>
  <text start="583.89" dur="6.27">build this country up</text>
  <text start="587.58" dur="6.09">from absolutely nothing to what it is</text>
  <text start="590.16" dur="5.52">today I mean think about what has been</text>
  <text start="593.67" dur="5.88">done here and we go back to the Clinton</text>
  <text start="595.68" dur="6.09">server and how China many others have</text>
  <text start="599.55" dur="6.03">access to it how they embedded chips</text>
  <text start="601.77" dur="6.66">into a lot of the technology this was</text>
  <text start="605.58" dur="6.21">all being done on purpose now</text>
  <text start="608.43" dur="7.02">corporations they&amp;#39;re starting to realize</text>
  <text start="611.79" dur="6.18">what China and others behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="615.45" dur="6.96">have been doing over the many many years</text>
  <text start="617.97" dur="9.18">and how their information has been sold</text>
  <text start="622.41" dur="6.69">and China is able to produce and to</text>
  <text start="627.15" dur="3.99">build their military and to do a lot of</text>
  <text start="629.1" dur="4.92">other things from this stolen</text>
  <text start="631.14" dur="5.1">information so then we need to go back</text>
  <text start="634.02" dur="4.86">to what Trump has been saying and what</text>
  <text start="636.24" dur="4.8">he&amp;#39;s been talking about all along first</text>
  <text start="638.88" dur="6.06">of all we already discuss this we know</text>
  <text start="641.04" dur="7.47">the trade imbalances amongst other</text>
  <text start="644.94" dur="5.73">countries are very lopsided and they</text>
  <text start="648.51" dur="3.66">don&amp;#39;t favor the United States because</text>
  <text start="650.67" dur="4.02">this was the plan of the deep state a</text>

  <text start="753.52" dur="4.86">manufacturers telling them what has been</text>
  <text start="756.43" dur="3.84">going on telling the public what has</text>
  <text start="758.38" dur="3.95">been going on this is why Trump has been</text>
  <text start="760.27" dur="4.83">pushing this out there so hard and</text>
  <text start="762.33" dur="5.2">continually saying that China is dealing</text>
  <text start="765.1" dur="5.58">in unfair practices remember it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="767.53" dur="5.16">China itself it&amp;#39;s those individuals the</text>
  <text start="770.68" dur="5.49">central bank the deep state that had</text>
  <text start="772.69" dur="5.4">been trying to destroy the United States</text>
  <text start="776.17" dur="4.29">I mean for a better word I mean they</text>
  <text start="778.09" dur="5.01">were destroying the United States I mean</text>
  <text start="780.46" dur="6.29">there are many empty factories I mean</text>
  <text start="783.1" dur="5.85">look at Detroit look around the country</text>
  <text start="786.75" dur="5.92">this has been going on for a very long</text>
  <text start="788.95" dur="8.04">time and right now the narrative is</text>
  <text start="792.67" dur="8.12">being flipped he&amp;#39;s exposing what these</text>
  <text start="796.99" dur="7.56">individuals have done and showing them</text>
  <text start="800.79" dur="5.34">what has been done and for companies</text>
  <text start="804.55" dur="4.65">this is very risky</text>
  <text start="806.13" dur="5.71">forget about cheap labor forget about</text>
  <text start="809.2" dur="7.02">subsidies if you know a country is</text>
  <text start="811.84" dur="9.09">stealing your information and they know</text>
  <text start="816.22" dur="7.05">your business information do you really</text>
  <text start="820.93" dur="7.02">want to be in that country you trust</text>
  <text start="823.27" dur="6.48">them no you don&amp;#39;t and this is what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="827.95" dur="4.2">trying to do right now not just him but</text>
  <text start="829.75" dur="4.47">others that are working with him to</text>
  <text start="832.15" dur="5.82">bring companies back to the United</text>
  <text start="834.22" dur="6.869">States so this is why we will eventually</text>
  <text start="837.97" dur="6.06">see manufacturers return to the US and</text>
  <text start="841.089" dur="6.091">this will take some time it will be over</text>
  <text start="844.03" dur="5.64">the next few years and there&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="847.18" dur="6.51">companies that are coming back more then</text>
  <text start="849.67" dur="8.16">will come back and there will be tax and</text>
  <text start="853.69" dur="7.32">maybe there&amp;#39;ll be subsidies but they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="857.83" dur="5.939">make it worth their while and Trump</text>
  <text start="861.01" dur="4.56">needs to do this this is why I got rid</text>
  <text start="863.769" dur="4.44">of the globalist system this is why he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="865.57" dur="4.5">been doing all of this because when this</text>
  <text start="868.209" dur="5.211">system comes down the central banking</text>
  <text start="870.07" dur="8.06">system when it comes down we need a base</text>
  <text start="873.42" dur="7.06">to produce we need this in place and</text>
  <text start="878.13" dur="6.37">this is what he&amp;#39;s trying to do this is</text>
  <text start="880.48" dur="6.72">why he wants guarantees from these</text>
  <text start="884.5" dur="5.94">manufacturers that they will be coming</text>
  <text start="887.2" dur="4.97">back because if there&amp;#39;s no guarantee and</text>
  <text start="890.44" dur="3.78">these manufacturers aren&amp;#39;t coming back</text>
  <text start="892.17" dur="4.15">when we get written once we get rid of</text>
  <text start="894.22" dur="3.9">the central bank system the United</text>
  <text start="896.32" dur="3.48">States is going to be sitting here</text>
  <text start="898.12" dur="4.62">without producing anything and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="899.8" dur="4.38">gonna be an awful situation now remember</text>
  <text start="902.74" dur="4.8">this has been going on for a very long</text>
  <text start="904.18" dur="6.63">time he has what two years now that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="907.54" dur="5.01">been working on this and he has to do</text>
  <text start="910.81" dur="5.76">this very very quickly because this</text>
  <text start="912.55" dur="6.39">system is at its end stage so right now</text>
  <text start="916.57" dur="4.259">he&amp;#39;s flipping the narrative using</text>
  <text start="918.94" dur="4.19">everything the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="920.829" dur="4.621">banks were using before against them</text>
  <text start="923.13" dur="6.79">showing the world what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="925.45" dur="8.28">doing and these individuals were just</text>
  <text start="929.92" dur="6.3">giving away all this information you can</text>
  <text start="933.73" dur="5.7">call stealing you can say it was sold to</text>
  <text start="936.22" dur="6.809">them whatever term you want to use they</text>
  <text start="939.43" dur="6.56">were doing it on purpose to get the</text>
  <text start="943.029" dur="5.731">manufacturers out of the United States</text>
  <text start="945.99" dur="5.14">because when the new system was going to</text>
  <text start="948.76" dur="4.61">be switched they needed to bring the</text>
  <text start="951.13" dur="5.459">United States down to a certain level</text>
  <text start="953.37" dur="5.589">now everything is switched switched up</text>
