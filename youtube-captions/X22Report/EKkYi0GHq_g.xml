  <text start="45.51" dur="3.18">with Greece at this time we realize</text>
  <text start="46.98" dur="4.95">there&amp;#39;s a payment coming up on April 9th</text>
  <text start="48.69" dur="4.56">we understand right now Greece is saying</text>
  <text start="51.93" dur="3.75">to Germany hey you know something</text>
  <text start="53.25" dur="4.02">you owe us about two hundred and seventy</text>
  <text start="55.68" dur="4.59">eight billion euros from World War two</text>
  <text start="57.27" dur="4.769">reparations that is more than the two</text>

  <text start="62.039" dur="7.171">you so actually you owe us money and of</text>
  <text start="66.78" dur="4.26">course we can see what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="69.21" dur="4.019">right now they&amp;#39;re trying to use this as</text>
  <text start="71.04" dur="4.89">leverage will they get that money from</text>
  <text start="73.229" dur="6.151">Germany I don&amp;#39;t know but we can see</text>
  <text start="75.93" dur="5.189">they&amp;#39;re also using Russia as leverage we</text>
  <text start="79.38" dur="3.599">have to remember that tsipras is going</text>
  <text start="81.119" dur="3.981">to be meeting with Putin on Wednesday</text>
  <text start="82.979" dur="6.661">and there is a chance that the Greek</text>
  <text start="85.1" dur="5.94">might maneuver and try to pivot towards</text>
  <text start="89.64" dur="4.53">Russia because you have to remember</text>
  <text start="91.04" dur="4.75">Putin extended his hand and said you</text>
  <text start="94.17" dur="3.9">know something we might be able to</text>
  <text start="95.79" dur="5.939">remove the ban you get out of the</text>
  <text start="98.07" dur="6.299">eurozone and we can help you out</text>
  <text start="101.729" dur="5.491">financially we can spur economic growth</text>
  <text start="104.369" dur="4.951">we can help your banks and we can see</text>
  <text start="107.22" dur="3.78">right now Greece is kind of setting</text>
  <text start="109.32" dur="3.39">themselves up for this because they</text>
  <text start="111" dur="4.13">redesign the drachma they said they were</text>
  <text start="112.71" dur="5.519">going to nationalize their banks and</text>
  <text start="115.13" dur="6.22">they&amp;#39;re using this to threaten the EU at</text>
  <text start="118.229" dur="7.591">this point and we have to understand if</text>
  <text start="121.35" dur="8.519">they do leave the eurozone it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="125.82" dur="7.2">default but don&amp;#39;t worry the banks Wall</text>
  <text start="129.869" dur="4.091">Street they&amp;#39;ve already decided how</text>
  <text start="133.02" dur="3.58">they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="133.96" dur="4.38">handle this and we have to remember the</text>
  <text start="136.6" dur="4.35">credit default swaps involved in Greek</text>
  <text start="138.34" dur="5.6">debt they are the same kind of financial</text>
  <text start="140.95" dur="5.73">instruments that triggered 2008 disaster</text>
  <text start="143.94" dur="5.68">as the negotiations over the write down</text>
  <text start="146.68" dur="5.97">of Greek debt unfolded one of the big</text>
  <text start="149.62" dur="5.73">questions that seemed to be hovering</text>
  <text start="152.65" dur="4.29">over all the markets was who bought the</text>
  <text start="155.35" dur="4.61">credit default swaps on the Greek debt</text>
  <text start="156.94" dur="5.82">and who would owe the big sums to cover</text>
  <text start="159.96" dur="8.05">the CD s obligations if there were a</text>
  <text start="162.76" dur="8.37">default and what happened was there was</text>
  <text start="168.01" dur="4.89">a special committee that governs credit</text>
  <text start="171.13" dur="4.62">default swaps they got together and said</text>
  <text start="172.9" dur="4.74">the Greek bailout a write down a 50% of</text>
  <text start="175.75" dur="4.17">the value of the Greek debt is voluntary</text>
  <text start="177.64" dur="4.5">and thus does not trigger the</text>
  <text start="179.92" dur="5.58">contractual terms of the credit default</text>
  <text start="182.14" dur="6.69">swaps that means the companies that sold</text>
  <text start="185.5" dur="5.79">the CD s&amp;#39;s will not have to cover the</text>
  <text start="188.83" dur="5.28">losses they had insured the decline in</text>
  <text start="191.29" dur="5.55">value of the Greek bonds so wait a</text>
  <text start="194.11" dur="5.49">minute who votes on this committee and</text>
  <text start="196.84" dur="6.93">who is this committee where did this</text>
  <text start="199.6" dur="6.84">come from guess where this entire</text>
  <text start="203.77" dur="7.29">committee was created it was created by</text>
  <text start="206.44" dur="9.03">Wall Street the banks Goldman Sachs JP</text>

  <text start="219.15" dur="5.47">included this in all the bank&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="221.56" dur="5.07">decided oh wait it&amp;#39;s voluntary they</text>
  <text start="224.62" dur="3.8">defaulted we don&amp;#39;t have to do anything</text>
  <text start="226.63" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;re out we&amp;#39;re good to go</text>

  <text start="270.83" dur="4.05">basically all they do is they just</text>
  <text start="273.29" dur="3.45">change the rules whenever they want and</text>
  <text start="274.88" dur="4.98">of course whenever they change the rules</text>
  <text start="276.74" dur="5.52">that benefit to them only period it</text>

  <text start="341.27" dur="4.59">saving to own their own home the main</text>
  <text start="343.64" dur="5.46">reasons to give up the hope of owning a</text>
  <text start="345.86" dur="6.12">home is the amount of money they have to</text>
  <text start="349.1" dur="4.59">put down they don&amp;#39;t make enough they</text>
  <text start="351.98" dur="3.3">can&amp;#39;t save enough and they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="353.69" dur="3.12">the money to put down on this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="355.28" dur="5.81">also saying that the high property</text>
  <text start="356.81" dur="6.9">prices and low income is also a problem</text>
  <text start="361.09" dur="5.59">over 80% of the people between the age</text>

  <text start="374.18" dur="7.11">Financial Times is reporting this they</text>
  <text start="377.6" dur="7.32">are saying that the British economy is a</text>
  <text start="381.29" dur="5.97">ticking time bomb so what&amp;#39;s the problem</text>
  <text start="384.92" dur="5.79">quite simply the key numbers are</text>
  <text start="387.26" dur="6.18">terrible according to the OECD after</text>
  <text start="390.71" dur="5.88">five years of austerity the UK&amp;#39;s budget</text>
  <text start="393.44" dur="5.22">deficit is 5.3 percent down from 11</text>
  <text start="396.59" dur="3.75">point 2 percent in 2009 in other words</text>
  <text start="398.66" dur="4.2">it has gone from being</text>
  <text start="400.34" dur="5.52">close to meltdown too too close to a</text>
  <text start="402.86" dur="5.52">meltdown situation to completely</text>
  <text start="405.86" dur="4.92">disastrous since the government is</text>
  <text start="408.38" dur="4.23">spending more than it burns it is hardly</text>
  <text start="410.78" dur="4.56">surprising that it is barring more and</text>
  <text start="412.61" dur="4.76">that the debt to GDP has risen from</text>
  <text start="415.34" dur="5.359">sixty eight point nine five percent in</text>
  <text start="417.37" dur="6.609">2009 to ninety three point three zero</text>
  <text start="420.699" dur="7.181">percent in 2013 according to OECD</text>
  <text start="423.979" dur="5.461">figures and we could see right now the</text>
  <text start="427.88" dur="4.95">people are struggling people can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="429.44" dur="5.94">purchase homes in the UK stores are</text>
  <text start="432.83" dur="6.42">closing in the UK just like in Canada</text>
  <text start="435.38" dur="6.18">just like in the US and we see here in</text>
  <text start="439.25" dur="2.82">the United States the situation is not</text>
  <text start="441.56" dur="4.38">getting better</text>
  <text start="442.07" dur="7.08">whatsoever for many Americans the rise</text>
  <text start="445.94" dur="5.46">in food and housing prices is a tough</text>
  <text start="449.15" dur="5.19">squeeze that&amp;#39;s because even in an era</text>
  <text start="451.4" dur="5.76">with low overall inflation low income</text>
  <text start="454.34" dur="6.99">Americans spent a disproportionate share</text>
  <text start="457.16" dur="6.3">of their money on food and housing new</text>
  <text start="461.33" dur="4.589">data from the Labor Department show the</text>
  <text start="463.46" dur="5.49">extent of the discrepancy the bottom 10</text>
  <text start="465.919" dur="5.461">percent of Americans by income devote 42</text>
  <text start="468.95" dur="5.37">percent of their spending to housing and</text>
  <text start="471.38" dur="5.13">an additional 17 percent to food nearly</text>
  <text start="474.32" dur="3.87">60 percent of their total spending</text>
  <text start="476.51" dur="5.219">according to the Consumer Expenditure</text>
  <text start="478.19" dur="6">survey by contrast the wealthiest 10% of</text>
  <text start="481.729" dur="4.651">Americans dedicate only 31 percent of</text>
  <text start="484.19" dur="5.159">their spending to housing and 11% to</text>
  <text start="486.38" dur="6.87">food closer to 40 percent of total</text>
  <text start="489.349" dur="6.781">spending and we can see yes this is true</text>
  <text start="493.25" dur="5.669">because those people who are having a</text>
  <text start="496.13" dur="7.23">tough time making it who are receiving a</text>
  <text start="498.919" dur="6.331">certain amount of dollars it goes to</text>
  <text start="503.36" dur="5.279">housing and food and they have a little</text>
  <text start="505.25" dur="6.599">bit left over when something goes wrong</text>
  <text start="508.639" dur="5.671">and/or prices go up with food they</text>
  <text start="511.849" dur="4.86">notice it right away because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="514.31" dur="5.64">have that extra money the wealthier</text>
  <text start="516.709" dur="5.13">people don&amp;#39;t care because they have a</text>
  <text start="519.95" dur="3.3">huge amount of disposable income so</text>
  <text start="521.839" dur="4.101">they&amp;#39;re spending they&amp;#39;re not they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="523.25" dur="5.4">feel like they&amp;#39;re spending as much</text>
  <text start="525.94" dur="4.45">because they still have the money and it</text>
  <text start="528.65" dur="4.41">really doesn&amp;#39;t hit them as hard when</text>
  <text start="530.39" dur="5.04">someone is making it day to day to day</text>
  <text start="533.06" dur="6.09">and you&amp;#39;re paying for something and it</text>
  <text start="535.43" dur="7.099">goes up by $1 or $2 it really affects</text>
  <text start="539.15" dur="6.51">your budget and it makes it harder to</text>
  <text start="542.529" dur="5.831">continue on and you try to figure out</text>
  <text start="545.66" dur="5.52">ways where you can cut back even further</text>
  <text start="548.36" dur="3.69">and before you know it you can&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="551.18" dur="2.94">back anymore</text>
  <text start="552.05" dur="5.7">you just run out of things to cut back</text>
  <text start="554.12" dur="4.77">on and this is their big big difference</text>
  <text start="557.75" dur="3.45">so when people are out there saying oh</text>
  <text start="558.89" dur="4.41">there&amp;#39;s no inflation I see nothing going</text>
  <text start="561.2" dur="5.76">on well I see as products getting</text>
  <text start="563.3" dur="5.43">smaller I see prices going up and if</text>
  <text start="566.96" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re not going up the prices the</text>
  <text start="568.73" dur="5.79">products are getting smaller so you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="571.79" dur="6.39">really getting less for the same amount</text>
  <text start="574.52" dur="7.08">of money so in reality the prices have</text>
  <text start="578.18" dur="5.28">gone up you see it with cereal you see</text>
  <text start="581.6" dur="5.52">it with ice cream you see it with</text>
  <text start="583.46" dur="6.15">crackers you see it with napkins you see</text>
  <text start="587.12" dur="4.74">it with a lot of different products and</text>
  <text start="589.61" dur="4.47">a lot of these companies are shrinking</text>
  <text start="591.86" dur="4.05">everything and we have to remember</text>
  <text start="594.08" dur="4.44">people are still being laid off</text>
  <text start="595.91" dur="4.44">companies are looking at their bottom</text>
  <text start="598.52" dur="4.23">line saying listen we&amp;#39;re not receiving</text>
  <text start="600.35" dur="3.69">the profits that we once had we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="602.75" dur="3.69">have to let people go we&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="604.04" dur="5.16">to reorganize eyes reorganize reorganize</text>
  <text start="606.44" dur="4.86">and we see Viacom right now they are</text>
  <text start="609.2" dur="4.61">announcing layoffs they haven&amp;#39;t given a</text>
  <text start="611.3" dur="7.289">number but they&amp;#39;re looking to cut about</text>
  <text start="613.81" dur="6.55">785 million dollars and we can see that</text>
  <text start="618.589" dur="5.011">once the number comes out there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="620.36" dur="6">to be more people out of work we see</text>

  <text start="941.79" dur="6.51">getting away from the dollar completely</text>
  <text start="943.89" dur="7.5">and we have to remember this year the</text>
  <text start="948.3" dur="6.96">IMF is gonna look at the yuan to see if</text>
  <text start="951.39" dur="6.29">it meets the reserve status and of</text>
  <text start="955.26" dur="5.46">course US Treasury secretary Jack Lew</text>
  <text start="957.68" dur="4.54">says the Chinese you want is not ready</text>
  <text start="960.72" dur="4.98">to be included in the basket reserve</text>
  <text start="962.22" dur="4.95">currencies and they need to have further</text>
  <text start="965.7" dur="3">reforms and they&amp;#39;re saying whatever they</text>
  <text start="967.17" dur="6.93">possibly can because you have to</text>
  <text start="968.7" dur="8.01">remember the US did not remove their</text>
  <text start="974.1" dur="4.35">voting rights from the IMF like they</text>
  <text start="976.71" dur="3.36">said they were going to do back in 2010</text>
  <text start="978.45" dur="4.05">they were going to give more of the</text>
  <text start="980.07" dur="5.52">emerging economies more voting power</text>
  <text start="982.5" dur="5.55">they didn&amp;#39;t do it because they knew what</text>
  <text start="985.59" dur="3.87">was happening here they understood that</text>
  <text start="988.05" dur="3.24">the dollar was collapsing and they</text>
  <text start="989.46" dur="4.95">didn&amp;#39;t want to give away these voting</text>
  <text start="991.29" dur="5.24">rights they see that the yuan has been</text>
  <text start="994.41" dur="5.64">built up they see that the ruble and</text>
  <text start="996.53" dur="6.31">Russia Russia&amp;#39;s economy has been getting</text>
  <text start="1000.05" dur="6.21">stronger and the US economy has been</text>
  <text start="1002.84" dur="6.84">declining right now Germany and France</text>
  <text start="1006.26" dur="6.12">are supporting the idea of making the</text>
  <text start="1009.68" dur="4.95">you want a reserve currency the IMF</text>
  <text start="1012.38" dur="5.46">Christine Lagarde said that yeah it</text>
  <text start="1014.63" dur="6.26">might be right now a good time to make</text>
  <text start="1017.84" dur="7.59">the you want a reserve currency a</text>
  <text start="1020.89" dur="7.87">currency that is already a settlement</text>
  <text start="1025.43" dur="6.48">currency is in which a people keep in</text>
  <text start="1028.76" dur="5.52">their savings so if countries and people</text>
  <text start="1031.91" dur="4.77">start to keep the yuan remember in their</text>
  <text start="1034.28" dur="5.34">savings the IMF doesn&amp;#39;t have to say it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1036.68" dur="4.77">a reserve currency by default it becomes</text>
  <text start="1039.62" dur="3.93">a reserve currency because people are</text>
  <text start="1041.45" dur="7.86">holding on to it because they trust it</text>
  <text start="1043.55" dur="9.21">they keep it in reserve so we can see</text>
  <text start="1049.31" dur="6.03">right now that the United States</text>
  <text start="1052.76" dur="4.62">government central bankers they realize</text>
  <text start="1055.34" dur="4.38">that the dollar is collapsing they</text>
  <text start="1057.38" dur="4.83">realize it&amp;#39;s the end game and if the</text>
  <text start="1059.72" dur="5.01">yuan starts to displace the dollar the</text>
  <text start="1062.21" dur="5.13">dollar sphere will diminish and dollar</text>
  <text start="1064.73" dur="4.68">supplies will turn out to be excessive</text>
  <text start="1067.34" dur="5.13">as a result the dollar rate will start</text>
  <text start="1069.41" dur="6.09">to fall and countries and people will</text>
  <text start="1072.47" dur="6.36">say why do we need the dollar we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1075.5" dur="5.19">we don&amp;#39;t have to hold it in reserve and</text>
  <text start="1078.83" dur="4.56">you know what happens when people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1080.69" dur="4.83">hold it in reserve it floods back to the</text>
  <text start="1083.39" dur="5.28">United States and if people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1085.52" dur="7.32">holding it in reserve it ceases to be a</text>
  <text start="1088.67" dur="7.34">reserve currency and we are seeing this</text>
  <text start="1092.84" dur="7.41">right now more and more countries are</text>
  <text start="1096.01" dur="8.23">bypassing the dollar they don&amp;#39;t want it</text>
  <text start="1100.25" dur="5.91">it&amp;#39;s toxic and they realize the US</text>
  <text start="1104.24" dur="5.19">government central bankers are pushing</text>
  <text start="1106.16" dur="4.77">war as hard as they possibly can because</text>
  <text start="1109.43" dur="4.53">there is no alternative</text>
  <text start="1110.93" dur="6.3">they don&amp;#39;t care who&amp;#39;s it with as long as</text>
  <text start="1113.96" dur="5.94">they can get a war started now we</text>
  <text start="1117.23" dur="6.6">understand Obama created that new</text>
  <text start="1119.9" dur="7.02">executive order on cybercrime and we</text>
  <text start="1123.83" dur="5.67">realized that there&amp;#39;s problems with it</text>
  <text start="1126.92" dur="5.73">and we know what he&amp;#39;s trying to do here</text>
  <text start="1129.5" dur="6.39">we know that sisse was not pushed</text>
  <text start="1132.65" dur="6.09">through it was not voted on yet it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1135.89" dur="4.17">still pending they tried to height they</text>
  <text start="1138.74" dur="3.24">tried to hype it up with all these</text>
  <text start="1140.06" dur="3.51">cyberattacks with Neiman Marcus Target</text>
  <text start="1141.98" dur="3.39">and everything like that and these were</text>
  <text start="1143.57" dur="3.78">all surface attempts they weren&amp;#39;t deep</text>
  <text start="1145.37" dur="4.08">the attacks and most of the information</text>
  <text start="1147.35" dur="3.63">that was leaked out you could have</text>
  <text start="1149.45" dur="3.21">gotten anywhere and of course they said</text>
  <text start="1150.98" dur="3.3">oh yeah it was a credit card beach but</text>
  <text start="1152.66" dur="4.62">they never really proved that to the</text>
  <text start="1154.28" dur="4.5">people they just mentioned it to make</text>
  <text start="1157.28" dur="6.53">everyone believe that this is what</text>
  <text start="1158.78" dur="8.25">happened but section one section B</text>
  <text start="1163.81" dur="5.53">allows the Secretary of the Treasury in</text>
  <text start="1167.03" dur="4.23">consultation with the Attorney General</text>
  <text start="1169.34" dur="4.89">and Secretary of State to make a</text>

  <text start="1179.39" dur="5.82">services and support of any of these</text>
  <text start="1181.85" dur="6.99">malicious attacks that is very broad in</text>
  <text start="1185.21" dur="5.16">general and we can see right now most</text>
  <text start="1188.84" dur="3.66">people think oh this is for other</text>
  <text start="1190.37" dur="5.69">countries other people outside the</text>
  <text start="1192.5" dur="8.28">country but when we look at it closely</text>
  <text start="1196.06" dur="9.88">there are concerns because this section</text>
  <text start="1200.78" dur="9">it doesn&amp;#39;t say where it takes place who</text>
  <text start="1205.94" dur="7.88">is involved with this it could be people</text>
  <text start="1209.78" dur="6.96">or organizations inside the country and</text>
  <text start="1213.82" dur="7.18">this section all also brings up</text>
  <text start="1216.74" dur="8.25">constitutional process concerns that if</text>
  <text start="1221" dur="5.61">it were to apply to people protected by</text>
  <text start="1224.99" dur="4.05">the US Constitution it could violate the</text>
  <text start="1226.61" dur="5.46">Fifth Amendment right to due process and</text>
  <text start="1229.04" dur="5.52">we can see right now that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1232.07" dur="5.16">care about the rights of the people they</text>
  <text start="1234.56" dur="6.18">want to go after anybody that is leaking</text>
  <text start="1237.23" dur="6.24">any type of information that is trying</text>
  <text start="1240.74" dur="4.98">to put the truth out there if they can</text>
  <text start="1243.47" dur="6.12">use this to close down websites they</text>
  <text start="1245.72" dur="7.56">will do it and you can see right now</text>
  <text start="1249.59" dur="7.5">they&amp;#39;re becoming desperate they realize</text>
  <text start="1253.28" dur="6.6">that this system is crashing them when</text>
  <text start="1257.09" dur="5.1">we look around the country and we look</text>
  <text start="1259.88" dur="4.02">around the world we see that every day</text>
  <text start="1262.19" dur="3.84">it gets worse and worse that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1263.9" dur="4.86">getting better and this is why London</text>
  <text start="1266.03" dur="4.98">ordered the water cannons this is why</text>
  <text start="1268.76" dur="4.56">there&amp;#39;s a European police that can be</text>
  <text start="1271.01" dur="4.56">dispatched to any European country to</text>
  <text start="1273.32" dur="4.5">help out in the situation this is why in</text>
  <text start="1275.57" dur="5.16">Spain they&amp;#39;re training their officers</text>
  <text start="1277.82" dur="6.69">for civil disobedience this is why they</text>
  <text start="1280.73" dur="5.34">implemented all the draconian laws that</text>

  <text start="1298.46" dur="4.77">why they&amp;#39;re setting up cages to say this</text>
  <text start="1301.13" dur="5.13">is where you have free speech this is</text>
  <text start="1303.23" dur="6.42">why they&amp;#39;re continually doing all of</text>
  <text start="1306.26" dur="5.79">this because they realize that the</text>
  <text start="1309.65" dur="7.25">system is crumbling and breaking apart</text>

  <text start="2356.66" dur="5.43">with cowards they would never ever do</text>
  <text start="2359.87" dur="5.91">that they want everyone else fighting</text>
  <text start="2362.09" dur="6">for them and behind them is the central</text>
  <text start="2365.78" dur="7.05">bankers who are orchestrating all of</text>
  <text start="2368.09" dur="6.12">this and we see out in England it seems</text>
  <text start="2372.83" dur="4.32">that hackers clone themselves</text>
  <text start="2374.21" dur="4.92">the Moroccan Islamic Union male have</text>
  <text start="2377.15" dur="3.93">launched an audacious cyber attack on</text>

  <text start="2383.51" dur="4.71">quality page and this happened around</text>
  <text start="2385.73" dur="4.08">7:00 a.m. on Tuesday morning it became</text>
  <text start="2388.22" dur="4.02">apparent that someone had replaced the</text>
  <text start="2389.81" dur="5.31">existent page with a photo of late Iraqi</text>
  <text start="2392.24" dur="4.83">despot Saddam Hussein and a garbled</text>
  <text start="2395.12" dur="4.44">warning it&amp;#39;s time to remind the British</text>
  <text start="2397.07" dur="4.32">government what you did with Assam with</text>
  <text start="2399.56" dur="3.6">Saddam Hussein will not</text>
  <text start="2401.39" dur="4.44">forget and we are ready to sacrifice</text>
  <text start="2403.16" dur="4.98">with everything it is not to give up a</text>
  <text start="2405.83" dur="4.62">rack and stay alert for coming for the</text>
  <text start="2408.14" dur="5.66">coming so it looks like they are getting</text>
  <text start="2410.45" dur="5.67">ready for a false flag event inside of</text>
  <text start="2413.8" dur="4.24">England and this will spread because</text>
  <text start="2416.12" dur="4.5">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is get the</text>
  <text start="2418.04" dur="5.52">people all riled up to believe that we</text>
  <text start="2420.62" dur="7.02">need to go to war and we will see these</text>
  <text start="2423.56" dur="8.19">events occur we see in Washington DC</text>
  <text start="2427.64" dur="6.54">there was a power outage and of course</text>
  <text start="2431.75" dur="3.96">the US government came right out so no</text>
  <text start="2434.18" dur="4.26">this was not terrorism and it looks like</text>
  <text start="2435.71" dur="3.39">there was an explosion at the power</text>
  <text start="2438.44" dur="2.88">plant</text>
  <text start="2439.1" dur="5.09">they&amp;#39;re still investigating this but</text>
  <text start="2441.32" dur="7.02">this is something that everyone needs to</text>
  <text start="2444.19" dur="8.08">understand and notice that when they</text>
  <text start="2448.34" dur="8.04">push this event to get people to go</text>
  <text start="2452.27" dur="8.28">along with war to cover up this economic</text>
  <text start="2456.38" dur="9.6">collapse they will use tactics like</text>
  <text start="2460.55" dur="7.8">blowing up a power plant they did this</text>
  <text start="2465.98" dur="5.37">out in California it was like a drop</text>
  <text start="2468.35" dur="5.94">trial run where they had people with</text>
  <text start="2471.35" dur="5.7">weapons they were taking down the power</text>
  <text start="2474.29" dur="4.29">plant we see in Washington there was an</text>
  <text start="2477.05" dur="4.23">explosion and it&amp;#39;s very easy to bring</text>
  <text start="2478.58" dur="4.11">the whole system down we can also see</text>
  <text start="2481.28" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;ll use cyberattacks</text>
  <text start="2482.69" dur="4.98">of course this will be an inside job it</text>
  <text start="2485.93" dur="4.14">will be our governor but government</text>
  <text start="2487.67" dur="7.95">officials convincing us that it was</text>
  <text start="2490.07" dur="8.34">another country or group and as we go</text>
  <text start="2495.62" dur="5.13">forward at that point in time we have to</text>
  <text start="2498.41" dur="6.24">say listen we know what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="2500.75" dur="5.49">we are not going to war you have to</text>
  <text start="2504.65" dur="6.77">remember they tried to get us into war</text>

  <text start="2523.67" dur="4.05">stopped it Putin once again not once but</text>
  <text start="2527.09" dur="4.38">twice</text>
