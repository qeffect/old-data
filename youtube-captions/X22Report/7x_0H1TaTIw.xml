  <text start="100.08" dur="5.27">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="101.91" dur="7.2">news now as we can see the crypto</text>
  <text start="105.35" dur="5.2">demonization is continuing the Bank for</text>
  <text start="109.11" dur="4.02">International Settlements they came out</text>
  <text start="110.55" dur="3.66">and they pretty much explain why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="113.13" dur="3.81">very nervous and afraid of</text>
  <text start="114.21" dur="5.76">cryptocurrency 1 they&amp;#39;re nervous that</text>
  <text start="116.94" dur="5.37">cryptocurrency will basically push fiat</text>
  <text start="119.97" dur="4.289">currency completely out the window and</text>
  <text start="122.31" dur="3.66">there is no reason to have a bank</text>
  <text start="124.259" dur="3.961">there&amp;#39;s no reason to have a central bank</text>
  <text start="125.97" dur="4.98">that&amp;#39;s one of their worries the other</text>
  <text start="128.22" dur="5.46">worry is that when they bring down the</text>
  <text start="130.95" dur="4.68">entire system they&amp;#39;re worried that</text>
  <text start="133.68" dur="5.22">people will be able to push a button and</text>
  <text start="135.63" dur="6.63">send all their digital currency into the</text>
  <text start="138.9" dur="5.49">crypto exchanges and remove their funds</text>
  <text start="142.26" dur="4.56">from the banking system that remember</text>
  <text start="144.39" dur="6.18">the beylin documents that they created</text>
  <text start="146.82" dur="5.729">was to go into the banks and take your</text>
  <text start="150.57" dur="3.75">currency because there are no more</text>
  <text start="152.549" dur="3.631">bailouts and this is the only way they</text>
  <text start="154.32" dur="3.24">can save all these banks because all</text>
  <text start="156.18" dur="3.99">these banks are insolvent they just</text>
  <text start="157.56" dur="5.33">don&amp;#39;t have the funds to give out to the</text>
  <text start="160.17" dur="7.349">people when there&amp;#39;s a crash and the FDIC</text>
  <text start="162.89" dur="7.54">that institution cannot come to anyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="167.519" dur="5.821">aid because they just don&amp;#39;t have enough</text>
  <text start="170.43" dur="5.25">funds to cover everyone and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="173.34" dur="4.29">worried about this now they did a test</text>
  <text start="175.68" dur="5.88">in Cyprus like we said yesterday where</text>
  <text start="177.63" dur="7.289">they basically had a bail in they shut</text>
  <text start="181.56" dur="5.34">down the banks they imposed rules where</text>
  <text start="184.919" dur="5.521">you couldn&amp;#39;t take your funds out</text>
  <text start="186.9" dur="5.28">and this lasted for over a year and they</text>
  <text start="190.44" dur="3.54">thought everything was all said and done</text>
  <text start="192.18" dur="4.77">then all of a sudden cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="193.98" dur="6.99">came out and people have figured out I</text>
  <text start="196.95" dur="7.8">can now move my funds out of the banking</text>
  <text start="200.97" dur="6.06">system completely before this was very</text>
  <text start="204.75" dur="4.47">difficult to do you could transfer your</text>
  <text start="207.03" dur="5.549">funds from bank to bank to bank but now</text>
  <text start="209.22" dur="7.7">you can move them out of the banking</text>
  <text start="212.579" dur="7.74">system this is why it is such a threat</text>
  <text start="216.92" dur="6.429">to their existence now what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="220.319" dur="6.271">there is the g20 meeting that&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="223.349" dur="5.97">up the central bankers they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="226.59" dur="5.759">discussing Bitcoin the crypto market we</text>
  <text start="229.319" dur="5.551">see Google and Facebook they have now</text>
  <text start="232.349" dur="5.28">banned online a ver - advertisements</text>
  <text start="234.87" dur="5.489">promoting crypto currencies and initial</text>
  <text start="237.629" dur="3.841">coin offerings they don&amp;#39;t want to have</text>
  <text start="240.359" dur="2.731">anything to do with it they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="241.47" dur="3.21">people to know about it they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="243.09" dur="4.44">anyone to know anything about it</text>
  <text start="244.68" dur="6.29">whatsoever and the reason for this is</text>
  <text start="247.53" dur="6.929">because they know what would happen and</text>
  <text start="250.97" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to demonize it by</text>
  <text start="254.459" dur="4.801">telling everyone that it&amp;#39;s very volatile</text>
  <text start="256.43" dur="4.359">terrorists use it it&amp;#39;s not really gonna</text>
  <text start="259.26" dur="4.23">be currency it&amp;#39;s create out of thin air</text>
  <text start="260.789" dur="4.801">and they kept doing this to try to</text>
  <text start="263.49" dur="4.049">convince everyone that you don&amp;#39;t need it</text>
  <text start="265.59" dur="3.63">now I speak to people out on the street</text>
  <text start="267.539" dur="4.261">and when you mention Bitcoin some people</text>
  <text start="269.22" dur="4.919">laugh and they say oh yeah you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="271.8" dur="4.86">not that great I hear it&amp;#39;s used by</text>
  <text start="274.139" dur="5.491">criminals the younger generation well</text>
  <text start="276.66" dur="4.2">they really like it so we have a mixed</text>
  <text start="279.63" dur="3.75">bag right now and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="280.86" dur="5.67">convince the entire population not to</text>
  <text start="283.38" dur="6.12">use it we see that February retail sales</text>
  <text start="286.53" dur="5.94">they have slipped now US retail slip by</text>
  <text start="289.5" dur="4.949">0.1% in February there are fewer sales</text>
  <text start="292.47" dur="5.069">at auto dealers and gas stations and</text>
  <text start="294.449" dur="6.03">department stores in February causing</text>
  <text start="297.539" dur="4.44">the overall retail sales to decline now</text>
  <text start="300.479" dur="3.331">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all of</text>
  <text start="301.979" dur="3.87">this and I&amp;#39;m starting to see this in the</text>
  <text start="303.81" dur="4.789">corporate media where they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="305.849" dur="6.661">listen the retail market is declining</text>
  <text start="308.599" dur="7.421">GDP is declining and even though Trump</text>
  <text start="312.51" dur="4.74">had his tax cuts signed into law even</text>
  <text start="316.02" dur="4.739">though they&amp;#39;re you know they&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="317.25" dur="5.939">effect the economy is now decline</text>
  <text start="320.759" dur="6.9">and slipping and they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="323.189" dur="6.54">retail sales arena has been declining</text>
  <text start="327.659" dur="6.57">for the third consecutive month in a row</text>
  <text start="329.729" dur="6.69">and they are comparing it to last year</text>
  <text start="334.229" dur="5.43">where they&amp;#39;re saying that it was 4%</text>
  <text start="336.419" dur="4.53">higher from a year ago now let&amp;#39;s think</text>
  <text start="339.659" dur="3.271">about what they&amp;#39;re doing and we</text>
  <text start="340.949" dur="5.3">mentioned this before the corporate</text>
  <text start="342.93" dur="6.629">media is starting to place the blame on</text>
  <text start="346.249" dur="5.35">Trump and they&amp;#39;re moving and pivoting</text>
  <text start="349.559" dur="3.63">very very slowly if you notice out of</text>
  <text start="351.599" dur="4.171">the corporate media they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="353.189" dur="4.95">show that the economy is not doing as</text>
  <text start="355.77" dur="4.53">well as they were reporting you know two</text>
  <text start="358.139" dur="4.471">three years ago it&amp;#39;s starting to break</text>
  <text start="360.3" dur="4.979">down they needed Trump in office they</text>
  <text start="362.61" dur="5.94">needed him to press policies so they can</text>
  <text start="365.279" dur="4.831">start this agenda to show that the</text>
  <text start="368.55" dur="3.839">economy is not doing well this would</text>
  <text start="370.11" dur="5.429">feed into the central bank bringing down</text>
  <text start="372.389" dur="5.34">the system we see already the GDP well</text>
  <text start="375.539" dur="3.571">that has fallen it started out at five</text>
  <text start="377.729" dur="3.78">point four percent which we knew which</text>
  <text start="379.11" dur="5.16">was absolutely ridiculous it is down now</text>
  <text start="381.509" dur="4.731">to 1.9 percent now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="384.27" dur="4.439">interesting about all this Lacey Hunt</text>
  <text start="386.24" dur="5.859">from strategic investment conference in</text>
  <text start="388.709" dur="6.031">2018 an economist and EVP of Hoisington</text>
  <text start="392.099" dur="5.1">Investment Management claimed that</text>
  <text start="394.74" dur="3.389">economics is a science and today it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="397.199" dur="2.28">more important than ever</text>
  <text start="398.129" dur="3.931">although economics is not you know</text>
  <text start="399.479" dur="4.5">precise as physics and chemistry he</text>
  <text start="402.06" dur="4.589">added our understanding in this domain</text>
  <text start="403.979" dur="6.33">gradually advances and then he moved</text>
  <text start="406.649" dur="5.461">into the economic situation first he</text>
  <text start="410.309" dur="4.14">started with the debt situation said</text>
  <text start="412.11" dur="3.959">it&amp;#39;s absolutely terrible looking for my</text>
  <text start="414.449" dur="2.61">debt perspective the situation looks</text>
  <text start="416.069" dur="3.301">terrible</text>
  <text start="417.059" dur="4.61">citing the law of diminishing returns he</text>
  <text start="419.37" dur="6.93">showed how more and more debt is</text>
  <text start="421.669" dur="8.37">required to boost output in 2007 global</text>
  <text start="426.3" dur="8.639">debt was 276 percent of global GDP today</text>
  <text start="430.039" dur="10">global debt is 327 percent of global GDP</text>
  <text start="434.939" dur="9.241">in 2007 a dollar in debt generated 37</text>
  <text start="440.039" dur="8.28">cents in GDP growth in 2017 a dollar in</text>
  <text start="444.18" dur="6.44">debt created only 31 cents in GDP money</text>
  <text start="448.319" dur="6.331">supply and bank credit they are</text>
  <text start="450.62" dur="6.639">collapsing and Bill halter and I</text>
  <text start="454.65" dur="4.62">had an interview yesterday I put it up</text>
  <text start="457.259" dur="3.66">today and we talked about the credit</text>
  <text start="459.27" dur="2.7">markets and how they&amp;#39;re going to freeze</text>
  <text start="460.919" dur="2.881">up so if you want to listen to that</text>
  <text start="461.97" dur="3.99">interview just go over to the x-22</text>
  <text start="463.8" dur="4.98">report spotlight and you can listen to</text>
  <text start="465.96" dur="6.12">the interview there he went on to say</text>
  <text start="468.78" dur="8.19">that meanwhile money velocity is at its</text>
  <text start="472.08" dur="7.559">lowest rate since 1949 adjusting GDP for</text>
  <text start="476.97" dur="4.89">vehicles now we know that we had natural</text>
  <text start="479.639" dur="3.9">disasters and there were a lot of</text>
  <text start="481.86" dur="3.779">automobiles that were destroyed about</text>
  <text start="483.539" dur="3.871">600 to 700 thousand cars were destroyed</text>
  <text start="485.639" dur="4.351">and they had to be replaced in the</text>
  <text start="487.41" dur="5.85">aftermath of these hurricanes that we</text>
  <text start="489.99" dur="6.6">had and the GDP was then you know</text>
  <text start="493.26" dur="5.01">adjusted it creeped up and everyone</text>
  <text start="496.59" dur="4.56">thought wow look how great the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="498.27" dur="6.119">doing but it didn&amp;#39;t hold this is</text>
  <text start="501.15" dur="5.37">temporary what this phenomenon did was</text>
  <text start="504.389" dur="4.921">to pull future auto sales into the</text>
  <text start="506.52" dur="4.829">present and it adds very little value to</text>
  <text start="509.31" dur="3.919">the economy it&amp;#39;s a good example of the</text>
  <text start="511.349" dur="4.86">broken window fallacy</text>
  <text start="513.229" dur="7.12">so the bump in GDP growth was due to an</text>
  <text start="516.209" dur="7.351">up to an anomaly and the overall trend</text>
  <text start="520.349" dur="7.771">remains constrained the yield curve it</text>
  <text start="523.56" dur="8.85">completely matters saying that the yield</text>
  <text start="528.12" dur="7.53">curve is an important indicator to let</text>
  <text start="532.41" dur="5.369">us know what is happening here he used</text>
  <text start="535.65" dur="4.53">the spread between long term Treasuries</text>
  <text start="537.779" dur="5.401">and in three-month bill which were which</text>
  <text start="540.18" dur="5.37">has been falling over the 90 months he</text>
  <text start="543.18" dur="4.11">suspected that if we get further rate</text>
  <text start="545.55" dur="5.4">hikes this year which they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="547.29" dur="7.23">about right now the spread will approach</text>
  <text start="550.95" dur="6.06">zero and could invert whether or not it</text>
  <text start="554.52" dur="4.74">actually inverts is not important he</text>
  <text start="557.01" dur="5.94">said what&amp;#39;s important is the similar</text>
  <text start="559.26" dur="9.03">conditions have preceded six of the last</text>
  <text start="562.95" dur="8.27">seven recessions basically what is</text>
  <text start="568.29" dur="7.16">happening right now is the entire</text>
  <text start="571.22" dur="7.75">economic system has been set up to fail</text>
  <text start="575.45" dur="7.9">this is what central bankers do they</text>
  <text start="578.97" dur="6.57">bring down the system and by raising the</text>
  <text start="583.35" dur="5.04">rates by doing everything the central</text>
  <text start="585.54" dur="5.19">bankers have done they are now</text>
  <text start="588.39" dur="6.54">in the process of shutting down the</text>
  <text start="590.73" dur="7.83">system Trump is doing the same exact</text>
  <text start="594.93" dur="6.719">thing they&amp;#39;re in a battle right now to</text>
  <text start="598.56" dur="4.62">control the narrative now the central</text>
  <text start="601.649" dur="4.44">bank they&amp;#39;re looking to raise the</text>
  <text start="603.18" dur="3.36">interest rates once again if they do do</text>
  <text start="606.089" dur="2.37">this</text>
  <text start="606.54" dur="3.51">it is another indicator showing that</text>
  <text start="608.459" dur="5.041">we&amp;#39;re heading in the same exact</text>
  <text start="610.05" dur="6.93">direction as we did back in 2008 where</text>
  <text start="613.5" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re going to push the rates even</text>
  <text start="616.98" dur="2.94">higher each and every single time and</text>
  <text start="618.93" dur="3.86">they&amp;#39;re probably going to raise them a</text>
  <text start="619.92" dur="5.25">lot faster than they&amp;#39;ve been doing and</text>
  <text start="622.79" dur="4.72">there&amp;#39;s a reason for this because they</text>
  <text start="625.17" dur="6.12">need to control the narrative of the</text>
  <text start="627.51" dur="6.42">crash Trump is doing the same thing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="631.29" dur="6.51">starting but everyone is calling the</text>
  <text start="633.93" dur="5.58">trade war but basically he he&amp;#39;s setting</text>
  <text start="637.8" dur="3.93">up the entire economic structure</text>
  <text start="639.51" dur="5.009">remember this economy it can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="641.73" dur="5.609">repaired the way it is the system is</text>
  <text start="644.519" dur="6.481">doomed the system is a central banking</text>
  <text start="647.339" dur="7.44">system so what he did was he enacted</text>
  <text start="651" dur="6.72">section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act which</text>
  <text start="654.779" dur="5.761">allows the President to do among other</text>
  <text start="657.72" dur="5.19">things impose duties or other import</text>
  <text start="660.54" dur="5.43">restrictions on the products of foreign</text>
  <text start="662.91" dur="4.98">countries if the president determines</text>
  <text start="665.97" dur="4.739">that the country is violating a trade</text>
  <text start="667.89" dur="4.939">agreement or engages in discriminatory</text>
  <text start="670.709" dur="5.07">or other acts or policies which are</text>
  <text start="672.829" dur="4.481">unjustifiable or unreasonable and which</text>
  <text start="675.779" dur="4.74">burden or restrict United States</text>
  <text start="677.31" dur="5.88">commerce the president has the ability</text>
  <text start="680.519" dur="5.701">to impose those duties or tariffs</text>
  <text start="683.19" dur="7.759">restrictions on other countries this is</text>
  <text start="686.22" dur="9.6">exactly what he is doing now this</text>
  <text start="690.949" dur="9.671">section 301 hasn&amp;#39;t really been relied on</text>
  <text start="695.82" dur="7.86">heavily since the Reagan era because</text>
  <text start="700.62" dur="5.7">what happened was they enacted the World</text>
  <text start="703.68" dur="6.96">Trade Organization which was formed in</text>
  <text start="706.32" dur="5.25">1995 why did they form the World Trade</text>
  <text start="710.64" dur="3.09">Organization</text>
  <text start="711.57" dur="3.629">well the central bankers wanted to make</text>
  <text start="713.73" dur="3.96">sure that each and every one of these</text>
  <text start="715.199" dur="4.62">countries there around the world didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="717.69" dur="4.14">do something like Trump is doing right</text>
  <text start="719.819" dur="4.351">now because it would</text>
  <text start="721.83" dur="7.85">mess up their system remember they were</text>
  <text start="724.17" dur="9.51">planning to create a one-world one</text>
  <text start="729.68" dur="6.52">monetary controlled system where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="733.68" dur="6.39">going to bring every country to the same</text>
  <text start="736.2" dur="6.45">exact level and enslave everyone under</text>
  <text start="740.07" dur="4.98">their system and the only way to do this</text>
  <text start="742.65" dur="3.42">is to take control of each and every one</text>
  <text start="745.05" dur="2.79">of these countries and they were going</text>
  <text start="746.07" dur="3.33">to do this through the TPP where they</text>
  <text start="747.84" dur="3.57">were going to have a court system which</text>
  <text start="749.4" dur="4.77">was on top of the gut which was above</text>
  <text start="751.41" dur="6.42">the government which would which could</text>
  <text start="754.17" dur="6.54">overrule any government&amp;#39;s decision while</text>
  <text start="757.83" dur="6.68">that was swept away remember everything</text>
  <text start="760.71" dur="8.34">that they&amp;#39;ve done was in preparation to</text>
  <text start="764.51" dur="8.53">control the entire Earth and to enslave</text>
  <text start="769.05" dur="5.28">everyone in their system and this is why</text>
  <text start="773.04" dur="3">they set up the World Trade Organization</text>
  <text start="774.33" dur="3.84">this is why they had these trade deals</text>
  <text start="776.04" dur="7.98">because they were in the process of</text>
  <text start="778.17" dur="7.98">moving things around and right now the</text>
  <text start="784.02" dur="4.77">central bankers they don&amp;#39;t like what</text>
  <text start="786.15" dur="4.83">Trump is doing it goes against</text>
  <text start="788.79" dur="4.17">everything that they&amp;#39;ve been planning</text>
  <text start="790.98" dur="3.81">for this is why the corporate media</text>
  <text start="792.96" dur="4.17">which is the mouthpiece for the central</text>
  <text start="794.79" dur="3.72">bank the deep state it&amp;#39;s the mouthpiece</text>
  <text start="797.13" dur="3.48">for all of them this is why they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="798.51" dur="4.35">there screaming and yelling trade wars</text>
  <text start="800.61" dur="4.29">are coming but I think behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="802.86" dur="5.07">just like in North Korea I think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="804.9" dur="4.8">other plans going on right now and from</text>
  <text start="807.93" dur="4.05">everything that I&amp;#39;ve been looking at and</text>
  <text start="809.7" dur="6.41">everything that I see I do believe that</text>
  <text start="811.98" dur="8.19">Russia China the United States Trump</text>
  <text start="816.11" dur="6.13">they are in talks behind the scenes this</text>
  <text start="820.17" dur="3.51">is not out in the corporate media they</text>
  <text start="822.24" dur="5.04">know the White House is bugged they know</text>
  <text start="823.68" dur="5.76">the phone systems bugged so they meet in</text>
  <text start="827.28" dur="3.18">private they have private conversations</text>
  <text start="829.44" dur="4.29">just like Trump had a private</text>
  <text start="830.46" dur="6.96">conversation with Kim jong-un to have</text>
  <text start="833.73" dur="5.43">this peace Dale in North Korea and I do</text>
  <text start="837.42" dur="4.29">believe because Putin has taken control</text>
  <text start="839.16" dur="4.44">of his private western central bank the</text>
  <text start="841.71" dur="3.45">Rothschilds do not make the decision</text>
  <text start="843.6" dur="6.69">there anymore this is why they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="845.16" dur="9.99">enemy that they&amp;#39;re in agreement to bring</text>
  <text start="850.29" dur="7.95">down the central banking system together</text>
  <text start="855.15" dur="5.85">they know it&amp;#39;s a problem they know the</text>
  <text start="858.24" dur="5.43">central banking system causes Wars they</text>
  <text start="861" dur="6.45">know that the central banking system</text>
  <text start="863.67" dur="6.57">does not need to exist and what I see</text>
  <text start="867.45" dur="5.25">happening right now is they are pushing</text>
  <text start="870.24" dur="4.62">this move now Trump keeps coming out</text>
  <text start="872.7" dur="6.48">saying he&amp;#39;s going to face - now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="874.86" dur="8.27">going to be even more tariffs against</text>
  <text start="879.18" dur="8.43">China China I from what I&amp;#39;m seeing is</text>
  <text start="883.13" dur="6.79">not going to react they might react a</text>
  <text start="887.61" dur="6.02">little bit but they&amp;#39;re really not going</text>
  <text start="889.92" dur="6.78">to react whatsoever they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="893.63" dur="5.17">start or have a trade war they know</text>
  <text start="896.7" dur="4.44">where this leads if they do and they</text>
  <text start="898.8" dur="3.45">know that when everything is all said</text>
  <text start="901.14" dur="5.16">and done and they can get rid of the</text>
  <text start="902.25" dur="7.11">central banking system a new system will</text>
  <text start="906.3" dur="4.68">emerge and I believe this is what</text>
  <text start="909.36" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re trying to do now the central</text>
  <text start="910.98" dur="5.76">bankers on the other hand they still</text>
  <text start="913.71" dur="5.28">want their system and this is why we see</text>
  <text start="916.74" dur="3.36">this battle going on right now now many</text>
  <text start="918.99" dur="3.63">people are saying well what happened to</text>
  <text start="920.1" dur="3.93">cryptocurrencies what how does that play</text>
  <text start="922.62" dur="4.23">any type of role in the new economic</text>
  <text start="924.03" dur="5.76">system well I do believe that countries</text>
  <text start="926.85" dur="5.25">are going to be trading at a higher</text>
  <text start="929.79" dur="3.87">level and they&amp;#39;re not going to use</text>
  <text start="932.1" dur="4.5">crypto currencies maybe some countries</text>
  <text start="933.66" dur="5.22">will and they might move into that realm</text>
  <text start="936.6" dur="4.65">but at a lower level for everyday</text>
  <text start="938.88" dur="5.52">purchases for every day things like that</text>
  <text start="941.25" dur="6.12">I think each one of these countries is</text>
  <text start="944.4" dur="5.52">going to allow the people to use crypto</text>
  <text start="947.37" dur="4.29">currencies to do this and I think</text>
  <text start="949.92" dur="3.09">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is all</text>
  <text start="951.66" dur="3.63">these crypto currencies will be</text>
  <text start="953.01" dur="4.65">interchangeable and you&amp;#39;ll be able to</text>
  <text start="955.29" dur="4.71">use whatever cryptocurrency you want to</text>
  <text start="957.66" dur="4.08">make a purchase now some companies some</text>
  <text start="960" dur="3.48">employers will pay you in the ones they</text>
  <text start="961.74" dur="3.9">like and others will pay you in</text>
  <text start="963.48" dur="3.51">different ones and I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="965.64" dur="3.63">going to be thousands of them there&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="966.99" dur="4.38">be a little basket of them what they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="969.27" dur="4.23">be using and they&amp;#39;ll all be at different</text>
  <text start="971.37" dur="5.01">rates and you can hold different ones</text>
  <text start="973.5" dur="4.95">and I do believe that at a lower level</text>
  <text start="976.38" dur="4.29">the people will use this this will not</text>
  <text start="978.45" dur="4.02">be controlled by the central banks they</text>
  <text start="980.67" dur="4.23">will not control whatsoever and at a</text>
  <text start="982.47" dur="5.49">higher level I think the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="984.9" dur="3.91">will then use whatever currency system</text>
  <text start="987.96" dur="5.319">am I</text>
  <text start="988.81" dur="6.42">might be a cryptocurrency system that</text>
  <text start="993.279" dur="4.591">they&amp;#39;ve developed where they can control</text>
  <text start="995.23" dur="3.45">the trade between you know countries and</text>
  <text start="997.87" dur="2.73">things like that</text>
  <text start="998.68" dur="4.65">where they&amp;#39;re selling oil and things</text>
  <text start="1000.6" dur="3.72">like that just like we see the petros in</text>
  <text start="1003.33" dur="2.91">Venezuela</text>
  <text start="1004.32" dur="5.58">but we can see right now we are</text>
  <text start="1006.24" dur="7.14">definitely headed to a very very big</text>
  <text start="1009.9" dur="5.46">change and how this turns out</text>
  <text start="1013.38" dur="4.83">well we hopefully it turns out where the</text>
  <text start="1015.36" dur="5.76">people control the currency hopefully</text>
  <text start="1018.21" dur="6.65">the central banks are no longer in</text>
  <text start="1021.12" dur="7.38">existence because if the central banks</text>
  <text start="1024.86" dur="8.29">stay if the central banks win this</text>
  <text start="1028.5" dur="6.99">battle we&amp;#39;re back on their system</text>
  <text start="1033.15" dur="6.36">nothing has changed we start all over</text>
  <text start="1035.49" dur="8.79">again and this is why we need to make</text>
  <text start="1039.51" dur="11.4">sure that the central bank system is not</text>
  <text start="1044.28" dur="9.87">allowed to live on we see that Rand Paul</text>
  <text start="1050.91" dur="4.8">he&amp;#39;s pushing his audit the Fed bill now</text>
  <text start="1054.15" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s gonna be very very difficult to get</text>
  <text start="1055.71" dur="6.84">the votes for this bill because a lot of</text>
  <text start="1059.04" dur="5.88">these congees government officials these</text>
  <text start="1062.55" dur="5.64">government employees they&amp;#39;re you know</text>
  <text start="1064.92" dur="4.8">paid for they&amp;#39;re corrupt and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1068.19" dur="4.71">want to go up against the central</text>
  <text start="1069.72" dur="7.32">banking system and think about it if</text>
  <text start="1072.9" dur="6.21">these governmental employees if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1077.04" dur="3.99">working for the people and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1079.11" dur="4.95">working for the United States and the</text>
  <text start="1081.03" dur="7.85">people come first why wouldn&amp;#39;t they want</text>
  <text start="1084.06" dur="9.33">to audit this organization that controls</text>
  <text start="1088.88" dur="7.24">the economy the creation of currency for</text>
  <text start="1093.39" dur="5.45">the United States what are they afraid</text>
  <text start="1096.12" dur="5.01">of why wouldn&amp;#39;t they want to do this</text>
  <text start="1098.84" dur="3.82">when it makes sense to order them to</text>
  <text start="1101.13" dur="6.14">make sure that everything is the way</text>
  <text start="1102.66" dur="8.37">it&amp;#39;s supposed to be because they are</text>
  <text start="1107.27" dur="5.56">controlling the entire economy the</text>
  <text start="1111.03" dur="3.84">creation of currency controlling</text>
  <text start="1112.83" dur="4.23">interest rates controlling pretty much</text>
  <text start="1114.87" dur="4.83">everything wouldn&amp;#39;t you want to make</text>
  <text start="1117.06" dur="5.64">sure that everything is on the up-and-up</text>
  <text start="1119.7" dur="5.52">in this organization</text>
  <text start="1122.7" dur="3.93">it makes no sense to me or pretty much</text>
  <text start="1125.22" dur="4.62">anyone else that I know of</text>
  <text start="1126.63" dur="6.09">why you wouldn&amp;#39;t want it audited it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1129.84" dur="4.44">like a company you know you go in and</text>
  <text start="1132.72" dur="5.16">you have an audit to make sure that the</text>
  <text start="1134.28" dur="5.61">books are all in order the only reason I</text>
  <text start="1137.88" dur="4.2">can think of is because these</text>
  <text start="1139.89" dur="5.1">individuals are being paid off they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1142.08" dur="6.18">corrupt they&amp;#39;re in line with the central</text>
  <text start="1144.99" dur="5.4">banking system and they know if anyone</text>
  <text start="1148.26" dur="5.3">goes and audits the central banking</text>
  <text start="1150.39" dur="7.26">system we&amp;#39;re gonna find out a lot more</text>
  <text start="1153.56" dur="7.14">than they want everyone to know so as we</text>

  <text start="1165.9" dur="4.26">gonna go one or two ways and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
