  <text start="85.81" dur="8.27">is just warming up for this late summer</text>

  <text start="94.08" dur="5.95">full-throttle right now and we can see</text>
  <text start="97.42" dur="4.41">by looking at what they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="100.03" dur="4.949">trying to convince everyone that the</text>
  <text start="101.83" dur="3.39">Zika virus is spreading and it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="104.979" dur="3.75">worse</text>
  <text start="105.22" dur="6.45">as time goes on and the ruling elite</text>
  <text start="108.729" dur="5.911">they know very well that when it comes</text>
  <text start="111.67" dur="5.25">to scaring the general public the tactic</text>
  <text start="114.64" dur="5.88">works more effectively when you build it</text>
  <text start="116.92" dur="5.94">up rather than hit the audience with a</text>
  <text start="120.52" dur="6.599">sudden story so they&amp;#39;ve been building</text>
  <text start="122.86" dur="6.36">this up over time saying oh look it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="127.119" dur="5.79">Puerto Rico oh look there&amp;#39;s one case in</text>
  <text start="129.22" dur="6.03">my in Florida it&amp;#39;s spreading and it</text>
  <text start="132.909" dur="7.021">started out in Brazil and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="135.25" dur="8.34">continually using this now Zika virus is</text>
  <text start="139.93" dur="6.63">a classic example of this we can see it</text>
  <text start="143.59" dur="6.929">real time right now now before the Zika</text>
  <text start="146.56" dur="8.97">virus then we have the Ebola scare then</text>
  <text start="150.519" dur="7.11">we have the swine flu scare then the CDC</text>
  <text start="155.53" dur="4.109">come out with all their computer models</text>
  <text start="157.629" dur="3.54">telling us within six months</text>
  <text start="159.639" dur="3.871">millions of people were going to be</text>
  <text start="161.169" dur="4.591">infected unless we do something</text>
  <text start="163.51" dur="5.28">whatever happened to that it just</text>
  <text start="165.76" dur="7.559">disappeared out of thin air they got it</text>
  <text start="168.79" dur="7.65">under control but pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="173.319" dur="6.841">companies they got money from the</text>
  <text start="176.44" dur="5.75">government to create vaccines and who</text>
  <text start="180.16" dur="4.14">knows this most likely be used later on</text>
  <text start="182.19" dur="4.299">now the first thing that we should note</text>
  <text start="184.3" dur="4.98">about the Zika virus is that the</text>
  <text start="186.489" dur="5.821">American Medical Association is now</text>
  <text start="189.28" dur="6.84">officially on board with this because</text>
  <text start="192.31" dur="6.42">they&amp;#39;re saying that the Zika the Zika</text>
  <text start="196.12" dur="5.49">virus which has been around since 1969</text>
  <text start="198.73" dur="6.27">the patent is held by the Rockefeller</text>
  <text start="201.61" dur="7.439">Foundation they are now calling it a</text>
  <text start="205" dur="6.51">sexually transmitted virus right now</text>
  <text start="209.049" dur="7.05">this is just another layer of the Zika</text>
  <text start="211.51" dur="6.42">virus like psychological operation so</text>
  <text start="216.099" dur="3.571">they&amp;#39;re making it seem like it is much</text>
  <text start="217.93" dur="6.899">much worse than it really is</text>
  <text start="219.67" dur="9.09">now when you hear this they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="224.829" dur="7.41">proof that it is what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="228.76" dur="6.449">they&amp;#39;re assuming it could be transmitted</text>
  <text start="232.239" dur="5.671">sexually they&amp;#39;re not showing any links</text>
  <text start="235.209" dur="5.761">or any way of this actually happening</text>
  <text start="237.91" dur="8.04">they haven&amp;#39;t run any tests but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="240.97" dur="6.75">just using this to build the SIOP up the</text>
  <text start="245.95" dur="4.14">New York Times even jumped in on the</text>
  <text start="247.72" dur="5.82">signup with a recent article making a</text>
  <text start="250.09" dur="5.76">spectacle of the new form of Zika sexual</text>
  <text start="253.54" dur="5.129">transmission and they&amp;#39;re trying to sell</text>
  <text start="255.85" dur="4.889">it like a new product to convince</text>
  <text start="258.669" dur="4.351">everyone that this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="260.739" dur="3.091">major problem now the question is why</text>
  <text start="263.02" dur="2.369">are they doing this</text>
  <text start="263.83" dur="5.01">well there&amp;#39;s many different agendas</text>
  <text start="265.389" dur="6.171">associated with this one to get funding</text>
  <text start="268.84" dur="5.84">for vaccines to have people vaccinated</text>
  <text start="271.56" dur="6.419">to make people scared to control them</text>
  <text start="274.68" dur="6.4">maybe to declare a state of emergency</text>
  <text start="277.979" dur="4.631">maybe the postpone the elections and we</text>
  <text start="281.08" dur="4.35">can see they&amp;#39;re doing this with many</text>
  <text start="282.61" dur="7.65">different things happening right now we</text>
  <text start="285.43" dur="6.68">see Milwaukee George Soros is now linked</text>
  <text start="290.26" dur="4.35">to what is happening in Milwaukee</text>
  <text start="292.11" dur="5.29">they&amp;#39;re trying to start a race war</text>
  <text start="294.61" dur="6.36">they&amp;#39;ve done this many many times before</text>
  <text start="297.4" dur="7.739">and they&amp;#39;re trying to push this very</text>
  <text start="300.97" dur="8.28">hard they want a reason to postpone</text>
  <text start="305.139" dur="8.671">these elections and it will be very easy</text>
  <text start="309.25" dur="6.57">for them to say listen Zika virus or</text>
  <text start="313.81" dur="5.55">these race Wars that are going on it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="315.82" dur="6.71">completely out of our control and we</text>
  <text start="319.36" dur="5.82">would love to have these elections held</text>
  <text start="322.53" dur="5.609">but we can see what&amp;#39;s happening in this</text>
  <text start="325.18" dur="7.049">country we just can&amp;#39;t let it happen</text>
  <text start="328.139" dur="6.851">because of what is going on here and we</text>
  <text start="332.229" dur="4.56">need to declare a state of emergency we</text>
  <text start="334.99" dur="4.38">need to postpone the elections until we</text>
  <text start="336.789" dur="5.551">get the situation under control now this</text>
  <text start="339.37" dur="5.609">will be temporary remember that word</text>
  <text start="342.34" dur="4.44">temporary I like to use that a lot like</text>
  <text start="344.979" dur="4.681">we&amp;#39;re gonna go off the gold standard in</text>
  <text start="346.78" dur="6.72">1971 this will be temporary it was 40</text>
  <text start="349.66" dur="8.039">years of temporary and we can see right</text>
  <text start="353.5" dur="6.99">now they&amp;#39;d rather do it this way then</text>
  <text start="357.699" dur="5.371">have the elections move forward because</text>
  <text start="360.49" dur="8.19">they are very nervous right now and they</text>
  <text start="363.07" dur="8.67">don&amp;#39;t want the people to decide on who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="368.68" dur="6.03">going to be President I know everyone</text>
  <text start="371.74" dur="5.7">believes that this is a free democratic</text>
  <text start="374.71" dur="5.04">society where we all vote and the votes</text>
  <text start="377.44" dur="5.25">are counted up and it&amp;#39;s all aboveboard</text>
  <text start="379.75" dur="5.61">and the person gets elected no that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="382.69" dur="5.52">not what it is they have a certain</text>
  <text start="385.36" dur="4.559">candidate they manipulate whatever they</text>
  <text start="388.21" dur="3.72">have to manipulate they get that person</text>
  <text start="389.919" dur="4.56">inside to take instructions from the</text>
  <text start="391.93" dur="5.06">shadow government the elite and then</text>
  <text start="394.479" dur="5.791">they call the shots and that person</text>
  <text start="396.99" dur="4.989">follows what they&amp;#39;re saying now if they</text>
  <text start="400.27" dur="4.44">get someone in there that doesn&amp;#39;t follow</text>
  <text start="401.979" dur="6.781">along they have to be removed</text>
  <text start="404.71" dur="7.44">later on and if a person does get into</text>
  <text start="408.76" dur="5.939">office most likely if they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="412.15" dur="7.29">following along they will be removed</text>
  <text start="414.699" dur="7.411">later on so it&amp;#39;ll be a lot easier to say</text>
  <text start="419.44" dur="5.07">listen this is completely out of our</text>
  <text start="422.11" dur="6.359">control and this is why the elections</text>
  <text start="424.51" dur="6.27">are postponed and we need to watch very</text>
  <text start="428.469" dur="3.991">closely how all this on</text>
  <text start="430.78" dur="3">rivals as we get closer and closer to</text>
  <text start="432.46" dur="3.42">the elections am I saying</text>
  <text start="433.78" dur="4.29">this is gonna definitely happen no but</text>
  <text start="435.88" dur="5.789">we can see they&amp;#39;re trying to push this</text>
  <text start="438.07" dur="6.72">type of an agenda now we know for a fact</text>
  <text start="441.669" dur="5.25">that their agendas their goals don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="444.79" dur="5.07">always work out their plans don&amp;#39;t always</text>
  <text start="446.919" dur="6.361">work out and things completely fall</text>
  <text start="449.86" dur="5.85">apart so we&amp;#39;ll be watching this very</text>
  <text start="453.28" dur="5.58">very closely as we get closer and closer</text>
  <text start="455.71" dur="6.09">to the elections we see out in</text>
  <text start="458.86" dur="5.34">Afghanistan the United States has called</text>
  <text start="461.8" dur="4.86">on India to step up its military aid to</text>
  <text start="464.2" dur="5.82">Afghanistan they want them to supply</text>
  <text start="466.66" dur="5.37">attack helicopters to help out there a</text>
  <text start="470.02" dur="6.649">lot of the other nations are not allowed</text>
  <text start="472.03" dur="8.21">to bring in any type of equipment</text>
  <text start="476.669" dur="5.741">because the sanctions imposed on Russia</text>
  <text start="480.24" dur="3.85">following US military involvement in</text>
  <text start="482.41" dur="3.81">Ukraine have prevented numerous donors</text>
  <text start="484.09" dur="8.25">from supplying Afghanistan with Russian</text>
  <text start="486.22" dur="8.43">made aircraft or spares so India was not</text>
  <text start="492.34" dur="4.86">constrained by any such consideration</text>
  <text start="494.65" dur="4.74">and it has no sanctions in place against</text>
  <text start="497.2" dur="5.52">Moscow and this is why they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="499.39" dur="7.74">India you must supply the equipment that</text>
  <text start="502.72" dur="10.68">we need in Afghanistan we see out in</text>
  <text start="507.13" dur="9.98">Ukraine Kiev admits Russia does have</text>
  <text start="513.4" dur="9.319">evidence of what took place in Crimea</text>
  <text start="517.11" dur="8.979">they admit that yes we were involved and</text>
  <text start="522.719" dur="5.411">the sabotage attempt really took place</text>
  <text start="526.089" dur="3.75">and we know the United States was out</text>
  <text start="528.13" dur="4.43">there saying we have no information</text>
  <text start="529.839" dur="7.141">about this and we know once Russia</text>
  <text start="532.56" dur="7.15">supplies the evidence it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="536.98" dur="3.99">over for the United States because</text>
  <text start="539.71" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re gonna look like fools</text>
  <text start="540.97" dur="6.33">the US government and Kiev finally came</text>
  <text start="544.75" dur="6.93">out and said okay listen quietly don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="547.3" dur="7.68">supply the evidence yes we know we did</text>
  <text start="551.68" dur="4.5">this and they&amp;#39;re admitting it now of</text>
  <text start="554.98" dur="2.97">course it&amp;#39;s not gonna be plastered all</text>
  <text start="556.18" dur="8.02">over the corporate media it was done</text>
  <text start="557.95" dur="8.05">very quietly we see out in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="564.2" dur="3.12">there&amp;#39;s a huge problem now we know the</text>
  <text start="566" dur="4.47">United States had this coup d&amp;#39;etat in</text>
  <text start="567.32" dur="4.49">Ukraine we know the economy was</text>
  <text start="570.47" dur="6.3">completely destroyed</text>
  <text start="571.81" dur="8.98">we know Russia is no longer supplying a</text>
  <text start="576.77" dur="6.66">lot of the energy to Ukraine we see this</text>
  <text start="580.79" dur="7.28">austerity the currency is collapsing</text>
  <text start="583.43" dur="8.13">utility bills are very high and the u.s.</text>
  <text start="588.07" dur="6.61">nato-ukraine they want to start this war</text>
  <text start="591.56" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;re trying and they need more</text>
  <text start="594.68" dur="7.55">individuals to join up to the armed</text>
  <text start="597.65" dur="7.07">forces so there&amp;#39;s a flyer going around</text>
  <text start="602.23" dur="5.71">saying that they will pay for the</text>
  <text start="604.72" dur="6">utility bills there&amp;#39;s an opportunity to</text>
  <text start="607.94" dur="5.82">take part in a NATO peacekeeping</text>
  <text start="610.72" dur="8.28">contingent and wages are a thousand to</text>
  <text start="613.76" dur="10.47">1200 euros and you&amp;#39;ll be able to pay</text>
  <text start="619" dur="7.57">your utility bills with this so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="624.23" dur="6.86">asking people to enroll in the Ukraine&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="626.57" dur="8.19">Armed Forces and get paid by NATO and</text>
  <text start="631.09" dur="5.68">they&amp;#39;re using the utility bill as like</text>
  <text start="634.76" dur="5.01">the hook to say listen we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="636.77" dur="6.42">very high this will pay it off just join</text>
  <text start="639.77" dur="6">the armed forces and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="643.19" dur="6.42">get more and more people involved</text>
  <text start="645.77" dur="5.76">because they need a bigger force for</text>
  <text start="649.61" dur="5.04">this major major offensive that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="651.53" dur="6.39">trying to push and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="654.65" dur="5.97">watch that very closely now out in Libya</text>
  <text start="657.92" dur="4.38">the United States is continually bombing</text>
  <text start="660.62" dur="4.95">in that country the unity government is</text>
  <text start="662.3" dur="5.49">falling apart and we see that Italy is</text>
  <text start="665.57" dur="4.58">out there saying listen we will train</text>
  <text start="667.79" dur="4.62">these security forces inside of Libya</text>
  <text start="670.15" dur="4.81">Germany says will it will now</text>
  <text start="672.41" dur="5.97">participate in the training of the</text>
  <text start="674.96" dur="5.33">Libyan Coast Guard so we already see all</text>
  <text start="678.38" dur="6.63">these countries getting into Libya</text>
  <text start="680.29" dur="7.78">bringing advisors trainers into the</text>
  <text start="685.01" dur="5.19">country and they use this as an excuse</text>
  <text start="688.07" dur="3.78">that yes we&amp;#39;re in here to train the</text>
  <text start="690.2" dur="6.23">security forces we&amp;#39;re in here to train</text>
  <text start="691.85" dur="6.12">the Coast Guard and this is why we have</text>
  <text start="696.43" dur="3.74">to</text>
  <text start="697.97" dur="5.14">inside of this area and we have to</text>
  <text start="700.17" dur="4.919">remember NATO and the rest of these</text>
  <text start="703.11" dur="5.55">European countries remember they were</text>
  <text start="705.089" dur="6.361">sailing their warships helping out with</text>
  <text start="708.66" dur="5.429">the refugee situation well all of these</text>
  <text start="711.45" dur="4.92">warships were in place for what is going</text>
  <text start="714.089" dur="6.091">on in Libya soon to be what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="716.37" dur="8.52">in Syria because that is not over just</text>
  <text start="720.18" dur="6.69">yet we see right now that turkey is</text>
  <text start="724.89" dur="5.73">still contemplating if they should close</text>
  <text start="726.87" dur="6.09">the border with Syria I know Russia came</text>
  <text start="730.62" dur="5.1">out and said listen you need to close</text>
  <text start="732.96" dur="5.61">this off and if turkey does close the</text>
  <text start="735.72" dur="5.309">border this is definitely a indicator a</text>
  <text start="738.57" dur="6.05">sign that they are moving closer and</text>

  <text start="821.01" dur="4.38">States and the coalition forces have</text>
  <text start="823.5" dur="4.35">been using the story that Assad must go</text>
  <text start="825.39" dur="4.439">because he&amp;#39;s a dictator he&amp;#39;s torturing</text>
  <text start="827.85" dur="3.42">his people then they changed the story</text>
  <text start="829.829" dur="3.121">saying that we</text>
  <text start="831.27" dur="4.29">have to go into Syria because there&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="835.56" dur="5.55">help the moderate rebels and we realize</text>
  <text start="837.99" dur="6.63">this story continually changes and what</text>
  <text start="841.11" dur="6.33">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="844.62" dur="5.97">United States government the central</text>
  <text start="847.44" dur="7.2">bankers well this is a very tough</text>
  <text start="850.59" dur="7.53">situation since China has joined in on</text>
  <text start="854.64" dur="6.54">all of this where does this leave the</text>
  <text start="858.12" dur="5.37">United States now we know their main</text>
  <text start="861.18" dur="4.8">objective here is the start of war we</text>
  <text start="863.49" dur="6.96">know China and Russia have been trying</text>
  <text start="865.98" dur="7.92">to step aside and create an atmosphere</text>
  <text start="870.45" dur="5.28">of peace because they realize the United</text>
  <text start="873.9" dur="5.46">States government central bankers their</text>
  <text start="875.73" dur="6.36">idea right now is to provoke some type</text>
  <text start="879.36" dur="4.56">of war Putin has already came out and</text>
  <text start="882.09" dur="4.2">said this when he was speaking to</text>
  <text start="883.92" dur="6.33">journalists saying don&amp;#39;t you realize how</text>
  <text start="886.29" dur="7.68">close we are to a world war don&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="890.25" dur="4.71">see what&amp;#39;s happening and we can see</text>
  <text start="893.97" dur="4.2">right now the United States government</text>
  <text start="894.96" dur="7.17">central bankers they have what are the</text>
  <text start="898.17" dur="6.51">two alternatives right now peace join up</text>
  <text start="902.13" dur="5.97">with China and Russia get rid of the</text>
  <text start="904.68" dur="7.8">terrorism in the country and leave Syria</text>
  <text start="908.1" dur="9.24">alone leave Iraq alone leave Libya alone</text>
  <text start="912.48" dur="9.57">leave Yemen alone or try to reach their</text>
  <text start="917.34" dur="8.42">goal and our goal is to have Syria to</text>
  <text start="922.05" dur="6.99">have Iran to control the Middle East and</text>
  <text start="925.76" dur="4.9">we can see right now I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="929.04" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re going to give up on this goal</text>
  <text start="930.66" dur="4.17">I know Russia has been trying to</text>
  <text start="932.94" dur="4.49">convince the United States government</text>
  <text start="934.83" dur="7.58">trying to box them into a corner</text>
  <text start="937.43" dur="8.91">because we&amp;#39;re getting reports that the</text>
  <text start="942.41" dur="7.66">Russian Defense Minister is saying that</text>
  <text start="946.34" dur="8.25">United States and Russia they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="950.07" dur="7.14">close enjoining together and battling in</text>
  <text start="954.59" dur="5.56">Aleppo to remove the terrorists there</text>
  <text start="957.21" dur="5.1">now of course the United States is</text>
  <text start="960.15" dur="4.74">saying the United States Department</text>
  <text start="962.31" dur="5.04">spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau</text>
  <text start="964.89" dur="4.85">well she refused to confirm any</text>
  <text start="967.35" dur="4.8">collaboration whatsoever now Russia</text>
  <text start="969.74" dur="5.86">continually tries to push them in this</text>
  <text start="972.15" dur="6.78">direction if terrorism is the problem</text>
  <text start="975.6" dur="5.91">then we should have a united force to go</text>
  <text start="978.93" dur="4.89">after terrorism this is why Russia has</text>
  <text start="981.51" dur="5.13">been asking the United States give us a</text>
  <text start="983.82" dur="4.89">list of the moderates and give us a list</text>
  <text start="986.64" dur="4.77">of who the terrorists are this way we</text>
  <text start="988.71" dur="4.41">will hit the terrorists we will not hit</text>
  <text start="991.41" dur="3.33">the moderates but we know the United</text>
  <text start="993.12" dur="4.95">States has them all intertwine because</text>
  <text start="994.74" dur="6.54">they pay them they supply them with</text>
  <text start="998.07" dur="6.36">weapons and they&amp;#39;re all terrorists</text>
  <text start="1001.28" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re all paid mercenaries so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1004.43" dur="6.12">see what the United States does at this</text>
  <text start="1006.74" dur="6.93">point are they going to go along with</text>
  <text start="1010.55" dur="5.19">Russia or is something going to happen</text>
  <text start="1013.67" dur="5.82">where that&amp;#39;s completely off the table</text>
  <text start="1015.74" dur="5.16">and we see the next event occur and this</text>
  <text start="1019.49" dur="4.53">is something that we really need to</text>
  <text start="1020.9" dur="4.77">watch because this is all intertwined</text>
  <text start="1024.02" dur="5.13">into the economy they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="1025.67" dur="6.72">there in Syria because the economy is</text>
  <text start="1029.15" dur="5.49">falling apart it&amp;#39;s the petrodollar they</text>
  <text start="1032.39" dur="4.47">need to continually go into these</text>
  <text start="1034.64" dur="4.2">countries spread debt put the natural</text>
  <text start="1036.86" dur="4.16">resources on the dollar and every</text>
  <text start="1038.84" dur="7.59">country has to sell oil using the dollar</text>
  <text start="1041.02" dur="8.29">if they lose this their system dies snap</text>
  <text start="1046.43" dur="5.01">of a finger boom dead this is why the</text>
  <text start="1049.31" dur="5.39">u.s. went into Libya in the first place</text>
  <text start="1051.44" dur="6.42">went into Lebanon went into Iraq and</text>
  <text start="1054.7" dur="5.02">into all these countries because some of</text>
  <text start="1057.86" dur="4.77">these countries they were getting ready</text>
  <text start="1059.72" dur="4.95">to use other currencies or even gold to</text>
  <text start="1062.63" dur="5.82">sell the oil and guess what the US could</text>
  <text start="1064.67" dur="5.37">not stand for this so when we look at</text>
  <text start="1068.45" dur="6.77">what&amp;#39;s going on here we see everything</text>
  <text start="1070.04" dur="10.86">is connected and the entire system the</text>
  <text start="1075.22" dur="11.77">entire rights of the people the way we</text>
  <text start="1080.9" dur="8.13">live here in America well it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1086.99" dur="5.58">deteriorating and we&amp;#39;ve seen it over</text>
  <text start="1089.03" dur="8.25">time and let&amp;#39;s look at some of the signs</text>
  <text start="1092.57" dur="6.06">that point to the American people going</text>
  <text start="1097.28" dur="5.82">back to a</text>
  <text start="1098.63" dur="8.7">global feudalist type of society I mean</text>
  <text start="1103.1" dur="6.33">we see arbitrary arrests incarceration</text>
  <text start="1107.33" dur="4.7">without regards to individual human</text>
  <text start="1109.43" dur="4.83">rights or civil liberties or</text>
  <text start="1112.03" dur="5.32">constitutional protections yes we do see</text>
  <text start="1114.26" dur="5.04">this we also see the ability of the</text>
  <text start="1117.35" dur="4.2">international banking cartels to plunder</text>
  <text start="1119.3" dur="5.81">the global populations personal bank</text>
  <text start="1121.55" dur="6.84">accounts and savings yes we do see this</text>
  <text start="1125.11" dur="9.79">we see the increased militarization of</text>
  <text start="1128.39" dur="9.45">police yes we see debtor prisons that is</text>
  <text start="1134.9" dur="5.49">happening right now we see the</text>
  <text start="1137.84" dur="5.25">privatization of Prisons making it</text>
  <text start="1140.39" dur="6.03">profitable to arrest and incarcerate</text>
  <text start="1143.09" dur="4.74">people even if they&amp;#39;re innocent we see</text>
  <text start="1146.42" dur="3.24">the refusal of the three separate</text>
  <text start="1147.83" dur="2.31">branches of government to watch each</text>
  <text start="1149.66" dur="3.65">other</text>
  <text start="1150.14" dur="6.27">intervene during times of overreach and</text>
  <text start="1153.31" dur="5.35">these branches of government well</text>
  <text start="1156.41" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re not loyal to the people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1158.66" dur="6.57">loyal to central banker bankers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1162.41" dur="6.45">loyal to foreign governments they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1165.23" dur="6.42">loyal to corporations they&amp;#39;re loyal to</text>
  <text start="1168.86" dur="4.56">everyone but the people we see the</text>
  <text start="1171.65" dur="4.38">refusal of the appellate or federal</text>
  <text start="1173.42" dur="5.42">courts to review or investigate state</text>
  <text start="1176.03" dur="7.2">court corruption police corruption</text>
  <text start="1178.84" dur="7.93">judicial corruption we see those in</text>
  <text start="1183.23" dur="7.7">power they are defined by different set</text>
  <text start="1186.77" dur="6.6">of laws compared to the everyday person</text>
  <text start="1190.93" dur="7.48">we see the refuse of the government to</text>
  <text start="1193.37" dur="7.44">punish or jail individual bankers they</text>
  <text start="1198.41" dur="6.6">have control of the monetary system they</text>
  <text start="1200.81" dur="10.59">have control of the media they have</text>
  <text start="1205.01" dur="11.69">control of the population so have we</text>
  <text start="1211.4" dur="9.63">returned to a global feudalist society</text>
  <text start="1216.7" dur="7.72">it&amp;#39;s starting to look that way it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1221.03" dur="5.16">starting to feel that way from</text>
