  <text start="95.17" dur="5.49">june fifth and we&amp;#39;re seeing that Greece</text>
  <text start="97.569" dur="5.731">right now they are saying they are very</text>
  <text start="100.66" dur="5.81">very close to making a deal now of</text>
  <text start="103.3" dur="6.45">course this deal does not include a</text>
  <text start="106.47" dur="5.56">compromise on labor a compromise on</text>
  <text start="109.75" dur="4.289">pensions but they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="112.03" dur="5.22">close to this deal but when we look at</text>
  <text start="114.039" dur="6.681">this this is what the ECB and the IMF</text>
  <text start="117.25" dur="6.45">want they want them to make a deal on</text>
  <text start="120.72" dur="5.649">basically austerity and Greece is saying</text>
  <text start="123.7" dur="5.279">no we can make a deal but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="126.369" dur="4.891">everything but that and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="128.979" dur="5.73">have to watch this situation and see how</text>
  <text start="131.26" dur="6.38">this turns out and in addition to all of</text>
  <text start="134.709" dur="6.061">this we have a German Finance Minister</text>
  <text start="137.64" dur="5.77">he&amp;#39;s conceded the possibility that</text>
  <text start="140.77" dur="4.74">Greece may need a parallel currency</text>
  <text start="143.41" dur="5.34">alongside the euro of the country talks</text>
  <text start="145.51" dur="5.58">with the creditors fail and maybe this</text>
  <text start="148.75" dur="4.92">is why they have the drachma already</text>
  <text start="151.09" dur="5.34">printed and I mean already designed and</text>
  <text start="153.67" dur="5.58">ready to go because we can see at this</text>
  <text start="156.43" dur="5.43">point in time the government was elected</text>
  <text start="159.25" dur="4.319">because the people did not want more</text>
  <text start="161.86" dur="3.93">austerity and</text>
  <text start="163.569" dur="4.59">the government gives in to the demands</text>
  <text start="165.79" dur="4.74">of the ECB and the IMF the people are</text>
  <text start="168.159" dur="4.651">going to be very very angry and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="170.53" dur="3.539">going to have to see what type of deal</text>
  <text start="172.81" dur="3.989">they come out with because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="174.069" dur="4.711">saying in the next 10 days there is</text>
  <text start="176.799" dur="4.56">going to be some type of deal now is</text>
  <text start="178.78" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re definitely going to be a deal we</text>
  <text start="181.359" dur="3.36">don&amp;#39;t know they&amp;#39;re giving us a lot of</text>
  <text start="182.98" dur="3.929">lip service at this point in time we</text>
  <text start="184.719" dur="4.981">know Greece is broke they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="186.909" dur="4.621">ability to raise the revenue and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="189.7" dur="4.5">kind of stuck in the situation at this</text>
  <text start="191.53" dur="4.679">point in time and when we look at this</text>
  <text start="194.2" dur="5.179">we see that Greece owes about three</text>
  <text start="196.209" dur="6.601">hundred and twelve billion dollars</text>
  <text start="199.379" dur="6.69">Greece will need another 42 years to pay</text>
  <text start="202.81" dur="5.329">back what it owes to its lenders</text>
  <text start="206.069" dur="6.191">provided that there&amp;#39;s no new debt and</text>
  <text start="208.139" dur="7.21">there is no added interest and we can</text>
  <text start="212.26" dur="4.86">see right now they are really in a tight</text>
  <text start="215.349" dur="4.381">line because what they&amp;#39;re going to get</text>
  <text start="217.12" dur="4.829">if they do make a deal is more debt</text>
  <text start="219.73" dur="5.729">period that&amp;#39;s it they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="221.949" dur="7.26">see economic growth whatsoever the</text>
  <text start="225.459" dur="8.851">central banking system does not know how</text>
  <text start="229.209" dur="7.65">to produce economic growth all they know</text>
  <text start="234.31" dur="5.849">how to do is continually put countries</text>
  <text start="236.859" dur="6.63">into debt rob them of their natural</text>
  <text start="240.159" dur="7.14">resources and give them more debt that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="243.489" dur="5.191">it period the end we see out in the</text>
  <text start="247.299" dur="4.351">eurozone we understand that things are</text>
  <text start="248.68" dur="6.149">completely falling apart countries are</text>
  <text start="251.65" dur="5.73">having a very tough time making it</text>
  <text start="254.829" dur="5.19">through and we see the eurozone consumer</text>
  <text start="257.38" dur="5.58">confidence now has deteriorated for a</text>
  <text start="260.019" dur="5.011">second straight month in May and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="262.96" dur="5.28">faster than expected the flash consumer</text>
  <text start="265.03" dur="5.84">confidence index drop to negative 5.5</text>
  <text start="268.24" dur="5.85">from negative 4.6 in April and we</text>
  <text start="270.87" dur="5.26">understand the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="274.09" dur="3.299">central bank&amp;#39;s the government&amp;#39;s are out</text>
  <text start="276.13" dur="3.93">there trying to convince us that the</text>
  <text start="277.389" dur="6.481">eurozone looks like it&amp;#39;s picking up once</text>
  <text start="280.06" dur="6.75">again but it is below the 2008 recession</text>

  <text start="1799.73" dur="5.43">people had no idea what was going on the</text>
  <text start="1802.91" dur="4.02">FBI is also seeing an increase in the</text>
  <text start="1805.16" dur="3.75">encryption remember the FBI does what</text>
  <text start="1806.93" dur="6.11">does not want encryption because they</text>
  <text start="1808.91" dur="8.06">can&amp;#39;t spy on the American people and</text>
  <text start="1813.04" dur="7.06">again I see encryption just like a safe</text>

  <text start="1820.1" dur="5.4">home no you wouldn&amp;#39;t wouldn&amp;#39;t you let</text>
  <text start="1823.85" dur="2.46">why wouldn&amp;#39;t you let the FBI just walk</text>
  <text start="1825.5" dur="3.18">through your home and look through all</text>
  <text start="1826.31" dur="5.37">your stuff it&amp;#39;s the same with encryption</text>
  <text start="1828.68" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s your private information there is</text>
  <text start="1831.68" dur="5.94">no reason for them to see your private</text>
  <text start="1833.57" dur="7.44">information and they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="1837.62" dur="4.65">terrorists now are using encryption well</text>
  <text start="1841.01" dur="3.87">what happens if the terrorists didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1842.27" dur="6.3">use the internet and they passed notes</text>
  <text start="1844.88" dur="6.33">around and then burn them afterwards how</text>
  <text start="1848.57" dur="5.88">would the FBI figure out what to do I</text>
  <text start="1851.21" dur="6.87">mean think about all this what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1854.45" dur="5.58">saying is absolutely ridiculous what</text>
  <text start="1858.08" dur="5.27">they really want to do is they really</text>
  <text start="1860.03" dur="6.09">want to spy on the American people and</text>
  <text start="1863.35" dur="6.76">they&amp;#39;re saying that since they&amp;#39;re all</text>

  <text start="1875.36" dur="6.21">say there was no encryption because they</text>
  <text start="1878.69" dur="6.09">had all the keys and methods in the past</text>
  <text start="1881.57" dur="6.469">and they didn&amp;#39;t stop any terrorism</text>
  <text start="1884.78" dur="6.229">whatsoever there was no terrorism</text>
  <text start="1888.039" dur="6.57">this is a production to convince</text>
  <text start="1891.009" dur="6.331">everyone that there are terrorists that</text>
  <text start="1894.609" dur="8.461">we should be afraid to give up our</text>

  <text start="1909.249" dur="5.43">becoming desperate at this time they</text>
  <text start="1912.549" dur="4.47">need to push the authorization for war</text>
  <text start="1914.679" dur="4.35">they need to push the people in to fear</text>
  <text start="1917.019" dur="3.99">they need the people they need people to</text>

  <text start="1922.96" dur="5.13">everything needs to be open you need to</text>
  <text start="1924.639" dur="6.9">find these terrorists but again they</text>

  <text start="1931.539" dur="5.76">terrorists here in the United States</text>
  <text start="1934.59" dur="4.539">wouldn&amp;#39;t be wouldn&amp;#39;t the best security</text>
  <text start="1937.299" dur="5.401">to give everyone a weapon and protect</text>
  <text start="1939.129" dur="5.821">themselves because you know the police</text>
  <text start="1942.7" dur="4.199">you know the armed forces they can&amp;#39;t be</text>
