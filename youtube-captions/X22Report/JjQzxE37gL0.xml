  <text start="30.41" dur="4.829">hi and welcome you listening to the x 22</text>
  <text start="33.86" dur="4.35">report my name is dave and this is</text>
  <text start="35.239" dur="5.041">episode 961 a and today&amp;#39;s date is made</text>
  <text start="38.21" dur="4.77">their 2016 and the title of the episode</text>
  <text start="40.28" dur="4.83">is the US government central bankers are</text>
  <text start="42.98" dur="5.25">now preparing to unleash the economic</text>
  <text start="45.11" dur="5.909">crash let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="48.23" dur="4.2">collapse financial news today we see it</text>
  <text start="51.019" dur="2.821">wasn&amp;#39;t a very good day on the market the</text>
  <text start="52.43" dur="3.6">market was down about a hundred and so</text>
  <text start="53.84" dur="4.859">points but we also see something very</text>
  <text start="56.03" dur="4.529">interesting happening today Tuesday the</text>
  <text start="58.699" dur="3.031">gold was suppressed now I thought it was</text>
  <text start="60.559" dur="3.09">going to be on Monday but I knew it was</text>
  <text start="61.73" dur="4.44">going to be sometime very very soon and</text>
  <text start="63.649" dur="4.381">they brought the goal down a little bit</text>
  <text start="66.17" dur="4.08">now most likely they&amp;#39;ll probably try</text>
  <text start="68.03" dur="4.71">tomorrow and I don&amp;#39;t think the gold is</text>
  <text start="70.25" dur="4.92">going to be suppressed as much as it has</text>
  <text start="72.74" dur="4.23">gone up and this is something that we</text>
  <text start="75.17" dur="4.83">need to look at every single time</text>
  <text start="76.97" dur="7.77">because as we move forward this is a</text>
  <text start="80" dur="8.64">signal that is telling us that they are</text>
  <text start="84.74" dur="7.35">losing control of the gold market of the</text>
  <text start="88.64" dur="8.31">silver market of the entire system and</text>
  <text start="92.09" dur="7.229">as people see gold continually rise and</text>
  <text start="96.95" dur="3.54">continually make moves like this where</text>
  <text start="99.319" dur="2.91">it&amp;#39;s going to go up fifty dollars a</text>
  <text start="100.49" dur="4.769">hundred dollars a hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="102.229" dur="4.471">dollars two hundred dollars people are</text>
  <text start="105.259" dur="4.86">going to say okay what is going on here</text>
  <text start="106.7" dur="5.07">let me start putting my currency into</text>
  <text start="110.119" dur="3.511">this hard asset we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="111.77" dur="3.269">sellers coming out of the market saying</text>
  <text start="113.63" dur="3.45">you know something I just want to go to</text>
  <text start="115.039" dur="4.53">the market at this point and take my</text>
  <text start="117.08" dur="3.659">funds and put it someplace else on a lot</text>
  <text start="119.569" dur="4.11">of people putting it into precious</text>
  <text start="120.739" dur="4.921">metals and when a lot more start to do</text>
  <text start="123.679" dur="3.151">this this is one gold is really going to</text>
  <text start="125.66" dur="3.87">start to move but this is something that</text>
  <text start="126.83" dur="5.55">we need to watch because every single</text>
  <text start="129.53" dur="4.56">day going forward we need to see by how</text>
  <text start="132.38" dur="4.5">much gold goes up how much they can</text>
  <text start="134.09" dur="5.58">suppress it by and where we go from here</text>
  <text start="136.88" dur="5.82">and this will give you a signal of how</text>
  <text start="139.67" dur="5.76">close we are to this crash coming up</text>
  <text start="142.7" dur="5.22">because once they lose control you will</text>
  <text start="145.43" dur="4.559">not be able to get gold supplies are</text>
  <text start="147.92" dur="4.23">going to run dry people are going to be</text>
  <text start="149.989" dur="4.89">scrambling so whatever whatever you have</text>
  <text start="152.15" dur="4.74">to do right now my advice and this is</text>
  <text start="154.879" dur="4.201">only my opinion and this is what i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="156.89" dur="4.56">doing is every time i see the gold price</text>
  <text start="159.08" dur="4.2">go up I don&amp;#39;t purchase just yet I wait</text>
  <text start="161.45" dur="2.7">for the suppression price to come down a</text>
  <text start="163.28" dur="2.7">little bit then</text>
  <text start="164.15" dur="3.839">I purchase then I watch it once again</text>
  <text start="165.98" dur="3.36">and I see it go up and we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="167.989" dur="4.321">going to come down just wait a day or</text>
  <text start="169.34" dur="5.94">two or three and go ahead and make your</text>
  <text start="172.31" dur="5.16">purchase and do this all the way up</text>
  <text start="175.28" dur="4.159">until eventually you will not be able to</text>
  <text start="177.47" dur="5.34">get any of the supplies whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="179.439" dur="4.991">it will be a mad rush into gold so this</text>
  <text start="182.81" dur="4.379">is something that we need to watch and</text>
  <text start="184.43" dur="6.54">this will give us a signal of how close</text>
  <text start="187.189" dur="5.461">we are getting now out in the EU we see</text>
  <text start="190.97" dur="3.54">that they&amp;#39;re continually pushing the</text>
  <text start="192.65" dur="4.47">idea that they&amp;#39;re in a complete recovery</text>
  <text start="194.51" dur="5.67">and everything is fine but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="197.12" dur="8.009">seeing right now is the EU has already</text>
  <text start="200.18" dur="7.559">slashed their growth from 1.7 to 1.6 but</text>
  <text start="205.129" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re saying in 2017 don&amp;#39;t worry the</text>
  <text start="207.739" dur="3.42">eurozone&amp;#39;s going to expand its going to</text>
  <text start="209.599" dur="4.86">expand by one point eight percent now</text>
  <text start="211.159" dur="4.5">they do this quite a bit where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="214.459" dur="4.021">trying to convince you that everything</text>
  <text start="215.659" dur="5.25">is fine we saw this happen in 2013 when</text>
  <text start="218.48" dur="5.789">they believed that something big was</text>
  <text start="220.909" dur="5.25">going to happen in Syria and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="224.269" dur="3.481">doing it once again where they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="226.159" dur="3.66">to convince everyone that the United</text>
  <text start="227.75" dur="4.41">States is doing well Europe is doing</text>
  <text start="229.819" dur="4.35">well and they&amp;#39;re trying to push the idea</text>
  <text start="232.16" dur="4.59">that everything is fine and things are</text>
  <text start="234.169" dur="5.04">going swimmingly well here and the</text>
  <text start="236.75" dur="4.859">market is continually moving up but what</text>
  <text start="239.209" dur="6.12">we need to watch is every time they do</text>
  <text start="241.609" dur="6.3">this this is in preparation for when the</text>
  <text start="245.329" dur="4.321">economy crashes we saw this happen in</text>
  <text start="247.909" dur="4.26">2008 where they try to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="249.65" dur="4.649">up to the last minute even during the</text>
  <text start="252.169" dur="3.841">crisis that everything was fine and we</text>
  <text start="254.299" dur="5.011">see right now they&amp;#39;re pushing this quite</text>
  <text start="256.01" dur="6.27">a bit now we see a lot more layoffs</text>
  <text start="259.31" dur="5.55">coming up right now and this is going to</text>

  <text start="307.05" dur="6.19">this is something that we need to watch</text>
  <text start="309.639" dur="8.67">because as we know as we move forward</text>
  <text start="313.24" dur="7.41">into 2016 going into 2017 going you know</text>
  <text start="318.309" dur="6.53">further than that we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="320.65" dur="6.75">this entire economy rip itself apart and</text>
  <text start="324.839" dur="5.531">we&amp;#39;re already seeing it we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="327.4" dur="5.609">everything decline yes we had this happy</text>
  <text start="330.37" dur="4.949">little cat dead cat bounce in April</text>
  <text start="333.009" dur="3.66">where the corporate media was out there</text>
  <text start="335.319" dur="3.21">telling you that everything is fixed</text>
  <text start="336.669" dur="3.661">it&amp;#39;s fine everything is great but of</text>
  <text start="338.529" dur="3.62">course we know there was an emergency</text>
  <text start="340.33" dur="5.04">meeting by the Fed who met with</text>
  <text start="342.149" dur="5.77">obama-biden bankers finance ministers</text>
  <text start="345.37" dur="4.829">and the only reason you have that type</text>
  <text start="347.919" dur="5.881">of meeting is if there is problems and</text>
  <text start="350.199" dur="6.96">there are problems now we understand</text>
  <text start="353.8" dur="6.329">that the central bank the bankers their</text>
  <text start="357.159" dur="5.22">system is built on debt and they</text>
  <text start="360.129" dur="4.59">continually want to spread their debt</text>
  <text start="362.379" dur="3.991">now with the Millennials what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="364.719" dur="3.63">been doing is they&amp;#39;ve been sending them</text>
  <text start="366.37" dur="4.199">back to school they&amp;#39;ve been putting them</text>
  <text start="368.349" dur="5.16">in debt which student loans and of</text>
  <text start="370.569" dur="4.65">course those young individuals who come</text>
  <text start="373.509" dur="3.541">out of college they can&amp;#39;t find jobs and</text>
  <text start="375.219" dur="4.021">living with their parents they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="377.05" dur="4.589">find the high paying job and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="379.24" dur="4.679">seeing right now is visa they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="381.639" dur="5.131">up with a plan to add infinitely more</text>
  <text start="383.919" dur="5.761">debt to the Millennials who are working</text>
  <text start="386.77" dur="4.619">as bartenders waiters who can&amp;#39;t find the</text>
  <text start="389.68" dur="4.44">full time job working at other part-time</text>
  <text start="391.389" dur="4.89">jobs or not working at all and visa</text>
  <text start="394.12" dur="4.289">right now has unveiled a detailed</text>
  <text start="396.279" dur="6.961">timeline by which they can accomplish</text>
  <text start="398.409" dur="7.951">this task now first visa estimates that</text>
  <text start="403.24" dur="4.469">all of those minimum wage jobs will be</text>
  <text start="406.36" dur="2.94">adding up to about eight point three</text>
  <text start="407.709" dur="4.89">trillion now this doesn&amp;#39;t mean that</text>
  <text start="409.3" dur="6.209">people have income where they can take</text>
  <text start="412.599" dur="5.21">it and use it but they see that oh maybe</text>
  <text start="415.509" dur="4.921">they can use it to make payments and</text>
  <text start="417.809" dur="4.09">they believe that the Millennials they</text>
  <text start="420.43" dur="4.199">use their cards around fifty-seven</text>
  <text start="421.899" dur="5.55">percent of their spending making them an</text>
  <text start="424.629" dur="7.081">attractive target because the</text>
  <text start="427.449" dur="7.771">Millennials they use revolving credit</text>
  <text start="431.71" dur="8.01">more than any generation so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="435.22" dur="7.08">going to market and sell credit to the</text>
  <text start="439.72" dur="6.84">Millennials with this new marketing</text>
  <text start="442.3" dur="6.78">campaign of how great it is and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="446.56" dur="4.59">hoping since they&amp;#39;re not making the</text>
  <text start="449.08" dur="6.39">funds and they want to go out and get</text>
  <text start="451.15" dur="8.46">you know items that they&amp;#39;ll use these</text>
  <text start="455.47" dur="7.23">credit cards and increase the debt now</text>
  <text start="459.61" dur="4.71">will this work most likely not there&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="462.7" dur="3.33">be a couple that will do this but others</text>
  <text start="464.32" dur="4.13">will say you know something I&amp;#39;m just not</text>
  <text start="466.03" dur="6.63">making enough or I don&amp;#39;t even have a job</text>
  <text start="468.45" dur="7.3">it&amp;#39;s not even worth it at this time now</text>
  <text start="472.66" dur="5.13">it looks like Fannie and Freddie they</text>
  <text start="475.75" dur="4.44">are quickly approaching the point where</text>
  <text start="477.79" dur="5.49">they won&amp;#39;t be able to weather the</text>
  <text start="480.19" dur="6.62">quarterly losses without going back to</text>
  <text start="483.28" dur="6.21">the Treasury for some type of bailout</text>
  <text start="486.81" dur="5.83">Freddie will hold about 1.2 billion in</text>
  <text start="489.49" dur="9.06">2016 it will drop them to 600 million in</text>
  <text start="492.64" dur="9.45">2017 and zero by 2018 and what we can</text>
  <text start="498.55" dur="6.03">see right now is that Freddie it there</text>
  <text start="502.09" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s done at this point fannie and</text>
  <text start="504.58" dur="5.88">freddie they&amp;#39;re not going to survive</text>
  <text start="506.53" dur="7.5">they will need a bailout and here we are</text>
  <text start="510.46" dur="5.01">once again just like in 2008 we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="514.03" dur="5.19">repeating everything all over again</text>
  <text start="515.47" dur="6.69">because nothing has changed yes the</text>
  <text start="519.22" dur="4.53">central bank the US government through</text>
  <text start="522.16" dur="3.27">the corporate media through their</text>
  <text start="523.75" dur="3.54">propaganda try to convince everyone that</text>
  <text start="525.43" dur="4.83">everything is different this time but it</text>
  <text start="527.29" dur="6.09">isn&amp;#39;t all they did was create this</text>
  <text start="530.26" dur="5.61">gigantic illusion with all these bubbles</text>
  <text start="533.38" dur="4.05">to make everyone believe that this time</text>
  <text start="535.87" dur="4.41">it&amp;#39;s completely different but what they</text>
  <text start="537.43" dur="6.38">did is all they did exist is extend what</text>
  <text start="540.28" dur="6.72">happened in 2008 into 2016 right now and</text>
  <text start="543.81" dur="5.62">actually it is much worse it is not</text>
  <text start="547" dur="4.35">better at this point because you have to</text>
  <text start="549.43" dur="6">remember all those people who are</text>
  <text start="551.35" dur="7.08">foreclosures four trillion dollars worth</text>
  <text start="555.43" dur="7.2">of foreclosures then we have short sales</text>
  <text start="558.43" dur="7.02">then we have all those people who lost</text>
  <text start="562.63" dur="4.8">their jobs that never got back</text>
  <text start="565.45" dur="4.05">up on their feet that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;ve all</text>
  <text start="567.43" dur="6.21">fallen off the market that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="569.5" dur="7.53">don&amp;#39;t count them anymore all the retail</text>
  <text start="573.64" dur="5.84">that is contracted so we can see nothing</text>
  <text start="577.03" dur="6.26">is the same now out in china</text>
  <text start="579.48" dur="5.92">manufacturing is declining contraction</text>
  <text start="583.29" dur="5.86">contracting for the 14th straight month</text>
  <text start="585.4" dur="6.99">in a row now this tells us that the</text>
  <text start="589.15" dur="5.85">other countries they&amp;#39;re not purchasing</text>
  <text start="592.39" dur="6.42">like they used to the people because</text>
  <text start="595" dur="6.57">china manufacturers for western</text>
  <text start="598.81" dur="3.93">countries for europe and then they take</text>
  <text start="601.57" dur="3">those products and they sell them back</text>
  <text start="602.74" dur="5.01">to those countries that&amp;#39;s what the</text>
  <text start="604.57" dur="5.31">manufacturing occurs if they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="607.75" dur="4.85">manufacturing that means people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="609.88" dur="4.68">purchasing that means the economy</text>
  <text start="612.6" dur="4.39">throughout the private western central</text>
  <text start="614.56" dur="4.02">bank countries is not doing well now</text>
  <text start="616.99" dur="3.15">because of this we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="618.58" dur="3.99">manufacturing down in the United States</text>
  <text start="620.14" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;re seeing it in China we&amp;#39;re seeing it</text>
  <text start="622.57" dur="3.48">all throughout the private wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="623.77" dur="4.62">central bank countries and we see the</text>
  <text start="626.05" dur="6.63">Baltic Dry Index when it hit that height</text>
  <text start="628.39" dur="7.98">of around 700 plus it is now down 602</text>
  <text start="632.68" dur="5.67">682 points down 21 points and it looks</text>
  <text start="636.37" dur="6.18">like we are back on the downward trend</text>
  <text start="638.35" dur="7.14">and what we saw in April was just this</text>
  <text start="642.55" dur="4.56">little tiny dead cat bounce where they</text>
  <text start="645.49" dur="3.63">try to convince her us that everything</text>
  <text start="647.11" dur="4.5">was fine but we know it is not things</text>
  <text start="649.12" dur="7.14">are rapidly deteriorating at this point</text>
  <text start="651.61" dur="8.01">and we&amp;#39;re seeing that clients of Bank of</text>
