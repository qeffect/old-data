  <text start="56.81" dur="4.83">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.22" dur="6.869">episode 1600 a.n today&amp;#39;s date is June</text>
  <text start="61.64" dur="6.03">25th 2018 and the top of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.089" dur="6.211">the Fed just released big news regarding</text>
  <text start="67.67" dur="5.76">the collapse but no one noticed let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="71.3" dur="4.319">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="73.43" dur="5.16">news now a couple days ago we talked</text>
  <text start="75.619" dur="6.991">about how the Supreme Court they voted</text>
  <text start="78.59" dur="5.61">on an online tax and we know that</text>
  <text start="82.61" dur="5.009">brick-and-mortar stores they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="84.2" dur="6.809">trouble on long stores if this tax goes</text>
  <text start="87.619" dur="7.071">through that&amp;#39;s going to destroy the</text>
  <text start="91.009" dur="5.761">entire online system of purchasing and</text>
  <text start="94.69" dur="5.98">we need to look at this very very</text>
  <text start="96.77" dur="5.97">carefully because the Supreme Court they</text>
  <text start="100.67" dur="4.589">basically totally rejected everything</text>
  <text start="102.74" dur="4.59">that the United States was built upon no</text>
  <text start="105.259" dur="4.831">taxation without representation instead</text>
  <text start="107.33" dur="4.47">of the greed of the states being</text>
  <text start="110.09" dur="4.529">confined to their own citizens the</text>
  <text start="111.8" dur="4.98">Supreme Court has ruled that if you are</text>
  <text start="114.619" dur="5.371">not a citizen of the state the state</text>
  <text start="116.78" dur="5.97">still has jurisdiction to compel you to</text>
  <text start="119.99" dur="5.879">collect taxes as an economic slave</text>
  <text start="122.75" dur="6.679">without any right to be represented in</text>
  <text start="125.869" dur="5.821">that state to oppose such legislation</text>
  <text start="129.429" dur="4.301">this is exactly what the American</text>
  <text start="131.69" dur="4.53">Revolution was all about the English</text>
  <text start="133.73" dur="5.52">Parliament would pass legislation that</text>
  <text start="136.22" dur="5.85">compelled colonists to pay taxes yet</text>
  <text start="139.25" dur="5.61">they were not represented in the English</text>
  <text start="142.07" dur="5.87">Parliament to object this is the most</text>
  <text start="144.86" dur="5.219">fundamentally unconstitutional</text>
  <text start="147.94" dur="4.12">anti-democratic decision ever handed</text>
  <text start="150.079" dur="4.861">down by the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="152.06" dur="4.8">all because of the hunt for money by the</text>
  <text start="154.94" dur="4.98">states and we know that the states they</text>
  <text start="156.86" dur="6.39">are in trouble and we can see at this</text>
  <text start="159.92" dur="6.78">point that the Supreme Court voted ok</text>
  <text start="163.25" dur="6.12">let&amp;#39;s go ahead let&amp;#39;s allow the states to</text>
  <text start="166.7" dur="4.47">collect the sales tax now this doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="169.37" dur="3.54">mean that every single state right now</text>
  <text start="171.17" dur="3.15">is going to be collecting sales tacking</text>
  <text start="172.91" dur="3.75">the sales tax and they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="174.32" dur="5.1">putting legislation moving forward</text>
  <text start="176.66" dur="5.189">because Congress well they can still act</text>
  <text start="179.42" dur="5.88">they can overrule this with clear</text>
  <text start="181.849" dur="4.231">legislation but if they don&amp;#39;t this will</text>
  <text start="185.3" dur="4.53">be</text>
  <text start="186.08" dur="6.6">a complete and utter disaster for</text>
  <text start="189.83" dur="4.02">e-commerce going forward just where the</text>
  <text start="192.68" dur="3.12">corporate media was out there saying</text>
  <text start="193.85" dur="4.05">online sales is taking away all the</text>
  <text start="195.8" dur="4.62">sales from brick-and-mortar no online</text>
  <text start="197.9" dur="4.47">sales is gonna go down the tubes brick</text>
  <text start="200.42" dur="3.66">and mortars going down the tubes both</text>
  <text start="202.37" dur="4.92">together are gonna be going down the</text>
  <text start="204.08" dur="6.57">tubes and remember 70% of the GDP is</text>
  <text start="207.29" dur="4.8">made up of individuals purchasing goods</text>
  <text start="210.65" dur="4.74">and this is not going to help because</text>
  <text start="212.09" dur="5.73">we&amp;#39;ve seen a sales tax in Japan we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="215.39" dur="4.89">seen it on soda we&amp;#39;ve seen it whenever</text>
  <text start="217.82" dur="6.96">the government gets involved and they</text>
  <text start="220.28" dur="6.87">impose taxes sales go down it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="224.78" dur="4.8">help the situation and this is just</text>
  <text start="227.15" dur="4.98">going to make it a lot worse we see</text>
  <text start="229.58" dur="4.44">things out in the housing market well</text>
  <text start="232.13" dur="4.38">things are not going well whatsoever we</text>
  <text start="234.02" dur="5.97">no existing home sales pending home</text>
  <text start="236.51" dur="6.66">sales and now new home sales they are</text>
  <text start="239.99" dur="8.01">plunging now there&amp;#39;s only one area where</text>
  <text start="243.17" dur="8.849">new home sales moved up around 6.7% and</text>
  <text start="248" dur="6.239">this was in the south all other areas it</text>
  <text start="252.019" dur="5.4">is plunging but you need to remember</text>
  <text start="254.239" dur="7.47">something very important there was a</text>
  <text start="257.419" dur="8.371">major downward revision in April to make</text>
  <text start="261.709" dur="7.351">the sales look a lot better in May but</text>
  <text start="265.79" dur="6.06">it really didn&amp;#39;t help that well because</text>
  <text start="269.06" dur="5.31">when we look new home sales were flat or</text>
  <text start="271.85" dur="5.37">negative in three of the four regions</text>
  <text start="274.37" dur="7.08">the Northeast they were down by negative</text>
  <text start="277.22" dur="7.98">10% the Midwest 0% flat line West down</text>
  <text start="281.45" dur="6.3">negative 8 point 7 percent and the south</text>
  <text start="285.2" dur="5.73">that is the only place where it&amp;#39;s surged</text>
  <text start="287.75" dur="6.06">and that is surging by seventeen point</text>
  <text start="290.93" dur="4.11">nine percent now when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="293.81" dur="3.359">can see that there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="295.04" dur="4.05">speculators in the south especially in</text>
  <text start="297.169" dur="4.411">Florida where they&amp;#39;re coming up from</text>
  <text start="299.09" dur="5.31">South America and many other areas where</text>
  <text start="301.58" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re speculating on the condos that</text>
  <text start="304.4" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re building houses that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="306.29" dur="4.2">building and we saw this back prior to</text>
  <text start="308.15" dur="5.19">2008 and once everything started to</text>
  <text start="310.49" dur="6">crash apartment buildings condos</text>
  <text start="313.34" dur="5.97">everything was just left there and that</text>
  <text start="316.49" dur="3.46">was that right now we&amp;#39;re seeing the same</text>
  <text start="319.31" dur="3.01">exact thing</text>
  <text start="319.95" dur="4.11">the same things happening in Miami in</text>
  <text start="322.32" dur="4.02">many different areas but we can see</text>
  <text start="324.06" dur="5.04">right now this push is not going to last</text>
  <text start="326.34" dur="3.42">whatsoever because the entire rest of</text>
  <text start="329.1" dur="3.09">the country</text>
  <text start="329.76" dur="5.04">well that is plunging and we know that</text>
  <text start="332.19" dur="5.04">pending home sales we know that existing</text>
  <text start="334.8" dur="5.13">home sales and as prices of homes</text>
  <text start="337.23" dur="5.22">continually rise and the interest rates</text>
  <text start="339.93" dur="4.35">continually move up it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="342.45" dur="4.2">last things are going to come tumbling</text>
  <text start="344.28" dur="4.68">down and we&amp;#39;ve seen this before now the</text>
  <text start="346.65" dur="4.35">strategy that Trump and the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="348.96" dur="2.94">putting forward it seems to be working</text>
  <text start="351" dur="2.88">right now</text>
  <text start="351.9" dur="5.46">and we need to remember what this</text>
  <text start="353.88" dur="6.57">strategy is remember the EU was created</text>
  <text start="357.36" dur="5.76">by the central bank the globalist to</text>
  <text start="360.45" dur="4.83">basically have a one currency system</text>
  <text start="363.12" dur="5.19">within this area that was the beginning</text>
  <text start="365.28" dur="5.25">stages of basically letting everyone</text>
  <text start="368.31" dur="4.98">know that hey look at work there now</text>
  <text start="370.53" dur="5.67">maybe we can expand this and have a one</text>
  <text start="373.29" dur="5.13">currency system for the complete world</text>
  <text start="376.2" dur="4.56">and this was just the beginning stages</text>
  <text start="378.42" dur="4.35">where they had a show that it would work</text>
  <text start="380.76" dur="4.26">and they created you know the World</text>
  <text start="382.77" dur="6.2">Trade Organization they were putting</text>
  <text start="385.02" dur="6.51">together a globalist trading system and</text>
  <text start="388.97" dur="4.21">European officials well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="391.53" dur="6.15">struggling to do everything they can to</text>
  <text start="393.18" dur="7.23">save the WTO which appears headed for an</text>
  <text start="397.68" dur="5.4">all but certain demise thanks to Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="400.41" dur="5.37">aggressive trade policies EU leaders</text>
  <text start="403.08" dur="5.46">have apparently circulated an internal</text>
  <text start="405.78" dur="5.34">memo drafted by the European Commission</text>
  <text start="408.54" dur="5.67">that accuses the u.s. of deliberately</text>
  <text start="411.12" dur="6.84">instigating the collapse of the global</text>
  <text start="414.21" dur="7.95">trade order and warns of an upcoming</text>
  <text start="417.96" dur="6.06">trade apocalypse and short if this</text>
  <text start="422.16" dur="4.71">document is any guy the trade war is</text>
  <text start="424.02" dur="5.87">about to get worse and this is what this</text>
  <text start="426.87" dur="7.71">is all about this is about breaking up</text>
  <text start="429.89" dur="7.78">the globalist system and it went on to</text>
  <text start="434.58" dur="6.03">say that our our world will go back to a</text>
  <text start="437.67" dur="5.43">trading environment where rules are only</text>
  <text start="440.61" dur="4.83">enforced where convenient and where</text>
  <text start="443.1" dur="4.71">strength replaces rules as the basis for</text>
  <text start="445.44" dur="5.01">trade relations according to this memo</text>
  <text start="447.81" dur="5.31">and what is happening right now is that</text>
  <text start="450.45" dur="4.86">one body is not going to control this</text>
  <text start="453.12" dur="4.38">there&amp;#39;s going to be bilateral trades all</text>
  <text start="455.31" dur="4.71">over the place so if this trade goes bad</text>
  <text start="457.5" dur="4.38">that trade is still good and we could</text>
  <text start="460.02" dur="2.79">see right now it&amp;#39;s not one body just</text>
  <text start="461.88" dur="4.59">controlling it</text>
  <text start="462.81" dur="6.6">it&amp;#39;s diversified and China&amp;#39;s doing it</text>
  <text start="466.47" dur="5.25">the u.s. is doing it now and the</text>
  <text start="469.41" dur="4.56">European countries they are moving in</text>
  <text start="471.72" dur="5.729">this direction also now something very</text>
  <text start="473.97" dur="6.509">strange minuchin was out there and in a</text>
  <text start="477.449" dur="4.801">bizarre development 1/2 one day after</text>
  <text start="480.479" dur="4.44">the Financial Times The Wall Street</text>
  <text start="482.25" dur="4.26">Journal Bloomberg all reported that the</text>
  <text start="484.919" dur="3.991">u.s. is preparing restrictions on</text>
  <text start="486.51" dur="4.2">Chinese investments in the US steve</text>
  <text start="488.91" dur="5.79">minuchin came out and he tweeted on</text>
  <text start="490.71" dur="9">behalf of donald trump that the stories</text>
  <text start="494.7" dur="7.77">are false fake news and this tweet went</text>
  <text start="499.71" dur="5.19">something like this on behalf of real</text>
  <text start="502.47" dur="4.29">Donald Trump the stories on investment</text>
  <text start="504.9" dur="5.73">restrictions in Bloomberg The Wall</text>
  <text start="506.76" dur="6.69">Street Journal are false fake news the</text>
  <text start="510.63" dur="5.25">leaker either doesn&amp;#39;t exist or know the</text>
  <text start="513.45" dur="4.829">subject very well now this is very</text>
  <text start="515.88" dur="5.36">interesting because venusian who came</text>
  <text start="518.279" dur="6.541">out and said things about China about</text>
  <text start="521.24" dur="6.46">the TPP where Trump is looking into it</text>
  <text start="524.82" dur="5.58">that all turned out to be fake and false</text>
  <text start="527.7" dur="6.24">so I don&amp;#39;t know why Trump would have</text>
  <text start="530.4" dur="6.45">minutia n-- come out and do this for him</text>
  <text start="533.94" dur="5.7">that kind of doesn&amp;#39;t make sense but</text>
  <text start="536.85" dur="4.92">we&amp;#39;ll have to see what comes out of this</text>
  <text start="539.64" dur="4.139">or maybe he&amp;#39;s setting minutiae up I</text>
  <text start="541.77" dur="5.939">don&amp;#39;t know remember minuchin is a</text>
  <text start="543.779" dur="7.351">goldman sachs boy and in the past he has</text>
  <text start="547.709" dur="6">been called out on certain things so</text>
  <text start="551.13" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this goes and what</text>
  <text start="553.709" dur="4.531">happens from this point on now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="556.47" dur="3.35">very interesting we mentioned yesterday</text>
  <text start="558.24" dur="5.84">about the Bank of International</text>
  <text start="559.82" dur="7.84">Settlement how they are telling us that</text>
  <text start="564.08" dur="6.1">the banking system well it&amp;#39;s not as</text>
  <text start="567.66" dur="4.83">strong as we all might think they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="570.18" dur="4.349">been manipulating their books and they</text>
  <text start="572.49" dur="3.63">basically explained how they were doing</text>
  <text start="574.529" dur="4.68">this now it looks like they are</text>
  <text start="576.12" dur="6.3">separating themselves from what is about</text>
  <text start="579.209" dur="5.641">to happen where the entire system is</text>
  <text start="582.42" dur="4.56">going to implode they don&amp;#39;t want to be a</text>
  <text start="584.85" dur="4.8">part of it because again</text>
  <text start="586.98" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re the Rothschild banking system</text>
  <text start="589.65" dur="5.04">they need to be above this they can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="592.26" dur="4.95">implicated in destroying the economies</text>
  <text start="594.69" dur="5.1">this way they can restart the entire</text>
  <text start="597.21" dur="4.26">system and then again put in other</text>
  <text start="599.79" dur="3.57">Senate private Western central banks</text>
  <text start="601.47" dur="3.24">into the countries and start the whole</text>
  <text start="603.36" dur="3.57">thing all over again they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="604.71" dur="4.08">about the Fed the ECB they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="606.93" dur="4.89">about that they&amp;#39;re destroyed it makes no</text>
  <text start="608.79" dur="6.09">difference as long as they kept as long</text>
  <text start="611.82" dur="4.59">as they&amp;#39;re kept separate from what is</text>
  <text start="614.88" dur="3.99">going on and that&amp;#39;s why they came out</text>
  <text start="616.41" dur="5.46">with that report now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="618.87" dur="6.84">interesting is that the Fed they just</text>
  <text start="621.87" dur="6.23">made a very interesting announcement and</text>
  <text start="625.71" dur="6.06">it&amp;#39;s kind of under the radar</text>
  <text start="628.1" dur="5.86">chairman Jerome Powell he delivered an</text>
  <text start="631.77" dur="5.55">important message that went largely</text>
  <text start="633.96" dur="6.66">unreported and when we look at this</text>
  <text start="637.32" dur="7.76">message he&amp;#39;s telling us that he intends</text>
  <text start="640.62" dur="7.02">to pop the bubbles both asset price and</text>
  <text start="645.08" dur="5.53">credit bubbles now he didn&amp;#39;t communicate</text>
  <text start="647.64" dur="5.97">a precise threshold for bubble popping</text>
  <text start="650.61" dur="4.77">but I believe he meant not just big</text>
  <text start="653.61" dur="4.86">bubbles but potentially little bubbles</text>
  <text start="655.38" dur="5.04">and possibly even pre bubbles if they</text>
  <text start="658.47" dur="6.87">become necessary to contain the risks of</text>
  <text start="660.42" dur="8.82">financial instability now basically we</text>
  <text start="665.34" dur="6.87">had in the past all different Fed</text>
  <text start="669.24" dur="6.66">Chairman and if we go back in time</text>
  <text start="672.21" dur="7.56">it was Janet Yellen Ben Bernanke and</text>
  <text start="675.9" dur="6.95">Alan Greenspan and in their speeches</text>
  <text start="679.77" dur="5.49">that they gave or when they had these</text>
  <text start="682.85" dur="6.07">meetings they never talked about</text>
  <text start="685.26" dur="6.3">financial excess and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="688.92" dur="5.52">interesting book because Powell actually</text>
  <text start="691.56" dur="5.85">mentioned this he went on to say we are</text>
  <text start="694.44" dur="5.94">aware that raising rates too slowly</text>
  <text start="697.41" dur="5.61">might raise the risk that monetary</text>
  <text start="700.38" dur="5.01">policy would need to tighten abruptly</text>
  <text start="703.02" dur="5.28">down the road in response to an</text>
  <text start="705.39" dur="7.32">unexpectedly sharp increase in inflation</text>
  <text start="708.3" dur="8.25">or financial excesses jeopardizing the</text>
  <text start="712.71" dur="6.42">economic expansion now the language in</text>
  <text start="716.55" dur="3.92">this sentence might seem ordinary if</text>
  <text start="719.13" dur="4.01">read very quickly</text>
  <text start="720.47" dur="5.61">but comparisons to what we would have</text>
  <text start="723.14" dur="6.78">heard from Yellen show it was a clear</text>
  <text start="726.08" dur="6.96">departure so Powell&amp;#39;s opening statement</text>
  <text start="729.92" dur="6.87">wasn&amp;#39;t just boilerplate language those</text>
  <text start="733.04" dur="6.66">three words or financial excesses never</text>
  <text start="736.79" dur="6.09">appeared in the same context in any of</text>
  <text start="739.7" dur="5.82">yellen&amp;#39;s 16 press conferences let alone</text>
  <text start="742.88" dur="5.88">in the opening statement here&amp;#39;s the UH</text>
  <text start="745.52" dur="6.06">next excerpt this one is in response to</text>
  <text start="748.76" dur="7.29">a question about wage growth our role</text>
  <text start="751.58" dur="7.53">though is also to you know to make sure</text>
  <text start="756.05" dur="6.03">that the maximum employment happens in a</text>
  <text start="759.11" dur="5.85">context of price stability and financial</text>
  <text start="762.08" dur="6.06">stability which is why were gradually</text>
  <text start="764.96" dur="4.68">raising rates now Yellen never define</text>
  <text start="768.14" dur="3.54">the feds role in the same way</text>
  <text start="769.64" dur="4.35">she never elevated financial stability</text>
  <text start="771.68" dur="4.53">to a position alongside the traditional</text>
  <text start="773.99" dur="5.73">goals of full employment and stable</text>
  <text start="776.21" dur="5.55">prices and take note Powell was</text>
  <text start="779.72" dur="4.47">answering a question about wage growth</text>
  <text start="781.76" dur="4.74">there was no prompting whatsoever</text>
  <text start="784.19" dur="4.2">the next questionnaire asked about</text>
  <text start="786.5" dur="3.99">inflation overshooting the feds target</text>
  <text start="788.39" dur="4.74">and here&amp;#39;s Powell&amp;#39;s response to this</text>
  <text start="790.49" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re going ahead and moving gradually</text>
  <text start="793.13" dur="5.16">and trying to navigate between two risks</text>
  <text start="795.47" dur="5.13">really one would be moving too quickly</text>
  <text start="798.29" dur="4.77">inflation never gets back to target if</text>
  <text start="800.6" dur="5.55">we do that and the other is moving too</text>
  <text start="803.06" dur="6.42">slowly and then we have we have too much</text>
  <text start="806.15" dur="5.91">inflation or financial instability and</text>
  <text start="809.48" dur="4.37">we have to raise quickly and that can</text>
  <text start="812.06" dur="6.03">also have bad outcomes</text>
  <text start="813.85" dur="6.67">once again Powell cited financial risks</text>
  <text start="818.09" dur="5.31">as a potential trigger for monetary</text>
  <text start="820.52" dur="6.57">tightening and once again his phrasing</text>
  <text start="823.4" dur="6">namely the conjunction or suggested he</text>
  <text start="827.09" dur="5.82">could raise rates quickly even without</text>
  <text start="829.4" dur="7.68">an inflation threat so what does this</text>
  <text start="832.91" dur="6.93">mean Powell announced he&amp;#39;s not afraid to</text>
  <text start="837.08" dur="5.43">pop bubbles meaning both asset and</text>
  <text start="839.84" dur="5.16">credit bubbles depending on how far he</text>
  <text start="842.51" dur="5.55">decides to take it he could even act to</text>
  <text start="845" dur="6.3">prevent bubbles before they inflate so</text>
  <text start="848.06" dur="5.47">what he&amp;#39;s saying here is that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="851.3" dur="5.75">preparing and pushing</text>
  <text start="853.53" dur="7.54">this system to the edge to pop these</text>
  <text start="857.05" dur="7.44">bubbles this is why the Fed is doing</text>
  <text start="861.07" dur="5.25">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now and I think</text>
  <text start="864.49" dur="4.32">what he&amp;#39;s going to be doing is pushing</text>
  <text start="866.32" dur="5.34">this even harder to bring down the</text>
  <text start="868.81" dur="5.28">system and he&amp;#39;s laying it out right in</text>
  <text start="871.66" dur="4.53">front of us saying yes he will do this</text>
  <text start="874.09" dur="3.66">because he sees that inflation will get</text>
  <text start="876.19" dur="5.04">out of hand they won&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="877.75" dur="6.45">control it and it will end up in a bad</text>
  <text start="881.23" dur="4.65">way and if they don&amp;#39;t do enough it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="884.2" dur="3.81">going to add up in a bad way because</text>
  <text start="885.88" dur="4.8">what&amp;#39;s happening here is the economy is</text>
  <text start="888.01" dur="5.58">built on an illusion there&amp;#39;s nowhere for</text>
  <text start="890.68" dur="6.15">the Fed to go at this point it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="893.59" dur="7.95">no-win situation why because it was</text>
  <text start="896.83" dur="6.75">never meant to go this long they never</text>
  <text start="901.54" dur="4.08">thought they would have to keep the</text>
  <text start="903.58" dur="4.08">system going this long they thought they</text>
  <text start="905.62" dur="3.57">were going to have their event which</text>
  <text start="907.66" dur="3.98">most likely was going to be some type of</text>
  <text start="909.19" dur="5.7">war to cover up this entire collapse</text>
  <text start="911.64" dur="5.31">plans change things changed they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="914.89" dur="5.13">know what to do at this point and</text>
  <text start="916.95" dur="6.43">they&amp;#39;re preparing right now to create</text>
  <text start="920.02" dur="6.75">this whole entire story to create this</text>
  <text start="923.38" dur="5.73">narrative of why this system came down</text>
  <text start="926.77" dur="4.23">and they&amp;#39;re in the position where they</text>
  <text start="929.11" dur="3.9">can pop the bubbles and if they do pop</text>
  <text start="931" dur="4.2">the bubbles it&amp;#39;s not going to be</text>
  <text start="933.01" dur="4.02">oh let&amp;#39;s inflate it very slowly it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="935.2" dur="4.62">going to be a pop and it&amp;#39;s gonna just</text>
  <text start="937.03" dur="5.55">completely deflate and things are gonna</text>
  <text start="939.82" dur="4.86">come down very very quickly we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="942.58" dur="5.24">this happen before in the past with</text>
  <text start="944.68" dur="5.91">Greenspan with Ben Bernanke with Yellen</text>
  <text start="947.82" dur="4.63">they just let the bubbles go and go and</text>
  <text start="950.59" dur="4.32">go and go and they pop by themselves</text>
  <text start="952.45" dur="5.04">they knew they were going to pop but</text>
  <text start="954.91" dur="4.29">they didn&amp;#39;t force them to pop here I</text>
  <text start="957.49" dur="3.75">think what they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="959.2" dur="4.86">to force them to pop because they have</text>
  <text start="961.24" dur="4.89">no choice right now because they need to</text>
  <text start="964.06" dur="5.13">control the narrative they need to</text>
  <text start="966.13" dur="6.39">control what is going on and they need</text>
  <text start="969.19" dur="6.38">to blame it on another party and I think</text>
  <text start="972.52" dur="6.69">this is why the biz right now is</text>
  <text start="975.57" dur="6.43">separating themselves saying the banks</text>
  <text start="979.21" dur="4.2">are insolvent they&amp;#39;re the ones who did</text>
  <text start="982" dur="4.26">this they&amp;#39;re the ones who manipulated</text>
  <text start="983.41" dur="3.64">their books the Fed right now is pushing</text>
  <text start="986.26" dur="2.98">towards</text>
  <text start="987.05" dur="4.86">bringing the system down the biz knows</text>
  <text start="989.24" dur="4.5">this they know exactly what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="991.91" dur="4.17">here and they don&amp;#39;t care if the Fed</text>
  <text start="993.74" dur="5.25">doesn&amp;#39;t exist after this they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="996.08" dur="4.77">if the ECB doesn&amp;#39;t exist after this</text>
  <text start="998.99" dur="4.5">because all they do is they can restart</text>
  <text start="1000.85" dur="6.81">and put another central bank in as long</text>
  <text start="1003.49" dur="5.82">as the biz and stays intact they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1007.66" dur="4.89">care what happens to the other central</text>
  <text start="1009.31" dur="7.05">banks that they can control so we see</text>
  <text start="1012.55" dur="6.27">right now there&amp;#39;s a push to bring the</text>
  <text start="1016.36" dur="5.7">system down the Rothschilds are</text>
  <text start="1018.82" dur="4.74">positioning themselves away from the</text>
  <text start="1022.06" dur="4.17">other central banks because they know</text>
  <text start="1023.56" dur="6.57">they can&amp;#39;t be associated with any of</text>
  <text start="1026.23" dur="6.66">this stuff and Powell he is pushing to</text>
  <text start="1030.13" dur="5.579">bring the system down and pop the</text>
