  <text start="302.07" dur="7.23">movement to break apart the central bank</text>
  <text start="305.88" dur="7.17">system started with the brexit because</text>
  <text start="309.3" dur="6.45">once the UK moves away other EU</text>
  <text start="313.05" dur="4.68">countries are going to look at this and</text>
  <text start="315.75" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;re gonna watch them and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="317.73" dur="6.15">gonna see wow they are really doing well</text>
  <text start="321.33" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;ve renegotiated all these trade</text>
  <text start="323.88" dur="4.98">agreements with other countries their</text>
  <text start="326.16" dur="7.41">bilateral trade agreements open and free</text>
  <text start="328.86" dur="6.81">trade and the UK is prospering other</text>
  <text start="333.57" dur="5.34">countries are gonna follow suit what</text>
  <text start="335.67" dur="6.48">happens to the EU well it starts to fall</text>
  <text start="338.91" dur="4.67">apart what happens to the ECB well it</text>
  <text start="342.15" dur="4.74">starts to fall apart</text>
  <text start="343.58" dur="6.07">this is the beginning of a movement and</text>
  <text start="346.89" dur="4.11">it started a while aback and this is why</text>
  <text start="349.65" dur="3.57">the central bankers are gonna be doing</text>
  <text start="351" dur="6.35">everything they possibly can to keep</text>
  <text start="353.22" dur="8.01">this deal in limbo that&amp;#39;s their agenda</text>
  <text start="357.35" dur="7.33">the people&amp;#39;s agenda I do believe is to</text>
  <text start="361.23" dur="5.91">break apart with a No Deal and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="364.68" dur="3.93">when you&amp;#39;re gonna see the EU completely</text>
  <text start="367.14" dur="5.49">start to fall apart now I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="368.61" dur="4.47">surprised if we saw events or something</text>
  <text start="372.63" dur="3.63">like that</text>
  <text start="373.08" dur="6.03">if the move started to pick up where</text>
  <text start="376.26" dur="4.74">there was a call to say listen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="379.11" dur="4.59">going with the known deal if we start to</text>
  <text start="381" dur="7.38">hear that we can expect to see many many</text>
  <text start="383.7" dur="7.5">events in the UK to scare the UK to go</text>
  <text start="388.38" dur="7.71">along with the EU deal or to stay with</text>
  <text start="391.2" dur="5.88">the EU now this is the beginning and I</text>
  <text start="396.09" dur="4.23">do believe they&amp;#39;re gonna be breaking</text>
  <text start="397.08" dur="5.76">apart with a No Deal and I think this is</text>
  <text start="400.32" dur="3.84">going to lead to many other things and I</text>
  <text start="402.84" dur="3.03">think this is what trumpet the Patriots</text>
  <text start="404.16" dur="5.15">are working on right now so Trump is</text>
  <text start="405.87" dur="7.02">working on the trade deal with China and</text>

  <text start="460.43" dur="6.01">everything is not going as planned but</text>
  <text start="463.23" dur="4.89">as we know Trump he likes to put the</text>
  <text start="466.44" dur="3.33">message out there that everything is</text>
  <text start="468.12" dur="3.24">going great and then he always says</text>
  <text start="469.77" dur="4.02">we&amp;#39;ll see what happens which means</text>
  <text start="471.36" dur="3.93">there&amp;#39;s a plan within a plan and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="473.79" dur="3.3">trying to keep the mainstream media off</text>

  <text start="478.62" dur="6.21">central banks off balance and when all</text>
  <text start="482.22" dur="4.2">of this is said and done there will be a</text>
  <text start="484.83" dur="6.15">deal with China</text>
  <text start="486.42" dur="7.8">what comes next why doesn&amp;#39;t the IMF the</text>
  <text start="490.98" dur="5.46">mainstream media the deep state players</text>
  <text start="494.22" dur="5.37">why don&amp;#39;t they want a deal with China</text>
  <text start="496.44" dur="5.04">why didn&amp;#39;t they want NAFTA renegotiated</text>
  <text start="499.59" dur="5.76">why didn&amp;#39;t they want Trump to get rid of</text>
  <text start="501.48" dur="7.11">TPP why didn&amp;#39;t they want Trump to get</text>
  <text start="505.35" dur="6.15">rid of the globalist trade plans why do</text>
  <text start="508.59" dur="6.33">they react when he contradicts the Fed</text>

  <text start="514.92" dur="4.59">they so afraid of there are afraid of</text>
  <text start="517.71" dur="4.29">their system falling apart</text>
  <text start="519.51" dur="4.65">remember Trump tweeted out about the</text>
  <text start="522" dur="5.07">brexit deal with the EU he said this</text>
  <text start="524.16" dur="7.11">would not be a good deal for it the UK</text>
  <text start="527.07" dur="7.14">it would limit them on trade he</text>
  <text start="531.27" dur="7.64">understands that there needs to be a</text>
  <text start="534.21" dur="7.88">clean break in the UK with a no deal</text>
  <text start="538.91" dur="6.73">because this will start the ball rolling</text>
  <text start="542.09" dur="5.89">he is pushing the agenda here in the</text>
  <text start="545.64" dur="4.74">United States and once the deal is made</text>
  <text start="547.98" dur="5.4">in China the mainstream media the deep</text>
  <text start="550.38" dur="5.01">state they are completely stuck remember</text>
  <text start="553.38" dur="4.05">the name of the game is to control the</text>
  <text start="555.39" dur="5.4">narrative he&amp;#39;s controlling the economy</text>
  <text start="557.43" dur="5">he has the magic wand he understands how</text>
  <text start="560.79" dur="4.37">all of this works</text>
  <text start="562.43" dur="4.77">and you can see those people who are</text>
  <text start="565.16" dur="4.5">running for the 2020 election they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="567.2" dur="6.06">trying to figure out a way on how to</text>
  <text start="569.66" dur="5.46">gain the narrative and talk about the</text>
  <text start="573.26" dur="5.4">economy but they can&amp;#39;t do it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="575.12" dur="5.64">completely impossible without trying to</text>
  <text start="578.66" dur="4.11">call out that there&amp;#39;s been manipulation</text>
  <text start="580.76" dur="5.4">they can&amp;#39;t take it too far</text>
  <text start="582.77" dur="6.48">or it turns on them and they understand</text>
  <text start="586.16" dur="5.88">this they do believe that there was a</text>
  <text start="589.25" dur="5.61">plan and there&amp;#39;s still a plan to bring</text>
  <text start="592.04" dur="4.859">the economy down in 2020 they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="594.86" dur="4.919">going to be shocked when the economy</text>
  <text start="596.899" dur="6.421">doesn&amp;#39;t come down and this leads me to</text>
  <text start="599.779" dur="7.051">what the next plan is the next plan is</text>
  <text start="603.32" dur="6.959">to make the deal and stop the mainstream</text>
  <text start="606.83" dur="7.47">media stop the IMF stop the central</text>
  <text start="610.279" dur="6.75">banks from saying the reason why global</text>
  <text start="614.3" dur="6.84">growth is slowing it&amp;#39;s because of the</text>
  <text start="617.029" dur="6.331">trade deal with China and the u.s. once</text>
  <text start="621.14" dur="3.389">he makes that deal that is out of the</text>
  <text start="623.36" dur="3.93">picture now think about this for a</text>
  <text start="624.529" dur="6.06">second what do the central banks have</text>
  <text start="627.29" dur="5.16">left to blame it on well if there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="630.589" dur="4.951">deal with China they can&amp;#39;t blame it on</text>
  <text start="632.45" dur="4.59">that all they have left is the debt in</text>
  <text start="635.54" dur="4.049">the world and what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="637.04" dur="6.09">is they&amp;#39;re going to try to spin this on</text>
  <text start="639.589" dur="5.911">that it&amp;#39;s the country&amp;#39;s fault for taking</text>
  <text start="643.13" dur="6.66">out all this debt it&amp;#39;s the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="645.5" dur="7.08">fault for taking out all this debt well</text>
  <text start="649.79" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s not really the countries fault it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="652.58" dur="5.07">not really the government&amp;#39;s fault</text>
  <text start="654.29" dur="8.31">because there&amp;#39;s no other way to run your</text>
  <text start="657.65" dur="8.82">system but to borrow the funds if they</text>
  <text start="662.6" dur="6.84">loan you one dollar or one euro and they</text>
  <text start="666.47" dur="5.85">attach interest to it how do you pay</text>
  <text start="669.44" dur="7.7">back the interest if you only received</text>
  <text start="672.32" dur="8.31">one of their pieces of paper currency</text>
  <text start="677.14" dur="6.34">you can&amp;#39;t create it yourself you have to</text>
  <text start="680.63" dur="6.09">borrow more so it really comes back to</text>
  <text start="683.48" dur="5.549">the central bank once again these are</text>
  <text start="686.72" dur="4.38">gonna try to spin this but I do believe</text>
  <text start="689.029" dur="4.471">that Trump and the Patriots and those</text>
  <text start="691.1" dur="3.87">fighting for the brexit they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="693.5" dur="2.34">start turning this around especially</text>
  <text start="694.97" dur="3.48">with China</text>
  <text start="695.84" dur="4.71">Andrusha all of this is going to be</text>
