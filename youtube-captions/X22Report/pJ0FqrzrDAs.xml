  <text start="52.78" dur="5.099">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="56.44" dur="5.369">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="57.879" dur="6.75">episode 1574 a-and today&amp;#39;s date is May</text>
  <text start="61.809" dur="6.511">22nd 2018 and the thought of the episode</text>
  <text start="64.629" dur="7.171">is European banks are in trouble it will</text>
  <text start="68.32" dur="6.15">spread like a disease let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="71.8" dur="5.849">economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="74.47" dur="5.64">there seems to be two camps out there</text>
  <text start="77.649" dur="5.01">one for cryptocurrency the other one for</text>
  <text start="80.11" dur="6.39">precious metals and when I look at it I</text>
  <text start="82.659" dur="5.221">believe one goes with the other and I</text>
  <text start="86.5" dur="3.929">believe eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="87.88" dur="5.46">happen is they&amp;#39;re going to support each</text>
  <text start="90.429" dur="5.071">other as we move forward as we move</text>
  <text start="93.34" dur="6.389">through the transition as we get rid of</text>
  <text start="95.5" dur="7.17">the Fayette central bank currency it</text>
  <text start="99.729" dur="5.551">will all change now the blockchain has</text>
  <text start="102.67" dur="5.1">the potential to revolutionize how gold</text>
  <text start="105.28" dur="7.68">and precious metals are manufactured and</text>
  <text start="107.77" dur="7.799">delivered consider the journey of a gold</text>
  <text start="112.96" dur="5.759">nugget and what it must go through and</text>
  <text start="115.569" dur="6.571">the supply chain from when they mine it</text>
  <text start="118.719" dur="5.521">to the end consumer it cuts through</text>
  <text start="122.14" dur="3.72">several other industries and practices</text>
  <text start="124.24" dur="5.04">including legal or regulatory of</text>
  <text start="125.86" dur="5.37">financial manufacturing and retail each</text>
  <text start="129.28" dur="5.34">of which might have its own ledger</text>
  <text start="131.23" dur="5.84">system these Ledger&amp;#39;s are vulnerable to</text>
  <text start="134.62" dur="4.95">hacking fraud errors misinterpretations</text>
  <text start="137.07" dur="4.87">they can be forged for example to</text>
  <text start="139.57" dur="6.11">conceal how the metal or mineral was</text>
  <text start="141.94" dur="9.079">sourced if they use blockchain</text>
  <text start="145.68" dur="8.23">technology to handle the mining of gold</text>
  <text start="151.019" dur="5.321">there&amp;#39;s no hiding anything remember</text>
  <text start="153.91" dur="6.53">it&amp;#39;s a ledger system it&amp;#39;s decentralized</text>
  <text start="156.34" dur="6.72">it&amp;#39;s a truth machine decentralization</text>
  <text start="160.44" dur="5.889">guarantees complete transparency meaning</text>
  <text start="163.06" dur="5.67">anyone along the supply chain can see</text>
  <text start="166.329" dur="5.19">how when where the metal is produced and</text>
  <text start="168.73" dur="3.62">who was involved in every step of the</text>
  <text start="171.519" dur="7.981">way</text>
  <text start="172.35" dur="10.809">so blockchain technology can be used for</text>
  <text start="179.5" dur="5.64">precious metals from when they mine it</text>
  <text start="183.159" dur="3.191">all the way to when it reaches the end</text>
  <text start="185.14" dur="4.27">consumer</text>
  <text start="186.35" dur="5.13">and this will give the industry a huge</text>
  <text start="189.41" dur="5.36">shot of trust not to mention</text>
  <text start="191.48" dur="7.38">dramatically increase efficiency</text>
  <text start="194.77" dur="5.86">now many producers tech firms and entire</text>
  <text start="198.86" dur="3.57">jurisdictions have already adopted or</text>
  <text start="200.63" dur="6.21">planned to adopt blockchain technology</text>
  <text start="202.43" dur="6.57">for this very reason we see I am gold a</text>
  <text start="206.84" dur="3.99">Toronto based producer announced last</text>
  <text start="209" dur="4.02">month that it partnered with tradewind</text>
  <text start="210.83" dur="3.57">markets a fin tech firm that uses</text>
  <text start="213.02" dur="5.09">blockchain technology to facilitate</text>
  <text start="214.4" dur="6.6">digital gold trading and we can see that</text>
  <text start="218.11" dur="6.85">blockchain can be used for finance</text>
  <text start="221" dur="8.61">healthcare insurance energy and a lot</text>
  <text start="224.96" dur="8.97">more and what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is a</text>
  <text start="229.61" dur="6.9">merging of the blockchain technology</text>
  <text start="233.93" dur="4.59">with precious metals and like I said in</text>
  <text start="236.51" dur="4.74">the beginning I believe these are gonna</text>
  <text start="238.52" dur="4.41">go hand in hand and I believe the</text>
  <text start="241.25" dur="4.2">blockchain is gonna be used for many</text>
  <text start="242.93" dur="4.8">different things not just for currency</text>
  <text start="245.45" dur="5.58">trade but for many other things because</text>
  <text start="247.73" dur="5.54">it is a truth machine you can always</text>
  <text start="251.03" dur="5.459">backtrack and find out what happened</text>
  <text start="253.27" dur="5.38">compared to today that is very difficult</text>
  <text start="256.489" dur="5.401">especially when you have a centralized</text>
  <text start="258.65" dur="5.58">system where maybe a central bank is</text>
  <text start="261.89" dur="4.62">controlling everything and there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="264.23" dur="4.02">transparency whatsoever you can&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="266.51" dur="5.82">their books you can&amp;#39;t see how everything</text>
  <text start="268.25" dur="6.81">is run you can&amp;#39;t see anything and with</text>
  <text start="272.33" dur="5.52">this it allows everyone to see</text>
  <text start="275.06" dur="7.17">everything so we can see that this could</text>
  <text start="277.85" dur="5.87">be used for both and everything and I</text>
  <text start="282.23" dur="4.59">believe this is where we&amp;#39;re headed and</text>
  <text start="283.72" dur="4.66">many individuals believe this is where</text>
  <text start="286.82" dur="3.54">we&amp;#39;re headed and I think eventually</text>
  <text start="288.38" dur="5.7">what&amp;#39;s going to happen this is going to</text>
  <text start="290.36" dur="6.06">take over everything and those companies</text>
  <text start="294.08" dur="4.98">that were doing business one way they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="296.42" dur="5.9">going to move slowly over to blockchain</text>
  <text start="299.06" dur="6.12">technology now the economy is</text>
  <text start="302.32" dur="3.52">continually breaking down yes we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="305.18" dur="3.06">going to be going through this</text>
  <text start="305.84" dur="3.96">transition yes we have new technologies</text>
  <text start="308.24" dur="4.17">yes we&amp;#39;re going to be moving away from</text>
  <text start="309.8" dur="4.35">the central bank eventually I think when</text>
  <text start="312.41" dur="4.05">the people start to wake up and realize</text>
  <text start="314.15" dur="4.47">that the central banks the corporate</text>
  <text start="316.46" dur="3.78">media have been demonizing blockchain</text>
  <text start="318.62" dur="3.81">cryptocurrencies and they start</text>
  <text start="320.24" dur="4.62">realize what it is as more corporations</text>
  <text start="322.43" dur="6">use it people then are gonna say whoa</text>
  <text start="324.86" dur="6.36">wait a minute why are we using a central</text>
  <text start="328.43" dur="7.29">bank why are we using a banking system</text>
  <text start="331.22" dur="6.15">that has fraud that has corruption why</text>
  <text start="335.72" dur="4.949">are we using a central bank that has no</text>
  <text start="337.37" dur="7.889">transparency but right now the economy</text>
  <text start="340.669" dur="6.03">is slowly dying and the central bankers</text>
  <text start="345.259" dur="5.071">they&amp;#39;ve been doing everything possible</text>
  <text start="346.699" dur="5.581">to keep the economy propped up and we</text>
  <text start="350.33" dur="3.48">know a little bit what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="352.28" dur="4.08">doing we know that they&amp;#39;ve been using</text>
  <text start="353.81" dur="5.699">quantitative easing they we know that</text>
  <text start="356.36" dur="5.459">they control the stock market we know</text>
  <text start="359.509" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;ve been creating bubbles but a lot</text>
  <text start="361.819" dur="3.361">of the work behind the scenes that</text>
  <text start="363.319" dur="4.741">they&amp;#39;ve been doing we just don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="365.18" dur="5.19">and I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s quite a bit this is</text>
  <text start="368.06" dur="4.68">why they don&amp;#39;t want anyone to audit what</text>
  <text start="370.37" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re doing but we see in the economy</text>
  <text start="372.74" dur="4.769">more and more stores they&amp;#39;re closing</text>
  <text start="374.33" dur="5.19">down and this is the first sign of how</text>
  <text start="377.509" dur="3.75">the economy starts to break apart you</text>
  <text start="379.52" dur="4.049">start to see it in retail you started to</text>
  <text start="381.259" dur="4.47">see it in restaurants you started to see</text>
  <text start="383.569" dur="3.871">it in housing you see it everywhere</text>
  <text start="385.729" dur="3.901">where the people are transacting</text>
  <text start="387.44" dur="4.05">business every single day this is where</text>
  <text start="389.63" dur="5.159">it breaks down first and then it spreads</text>
  <text start="391.49" dur="5.04">to the stock market and everywhere else</text>
  <text start="394.789" dur="3.06">and of course the stock market is</text>
  <text start="396.53" dur="2.91">usually when everyone goes oh my god it</text>
  <text start="397.849" dur="3.421">came down there must be something wrong</text>
  <text start="399.44" dur="3.93">no there&amp;#39;s been something wrong for</text>
  <text start="401.27" dur="3.449">quite a while just that no one really</text>
  <text start="403.37" dur="3.99">noticed it Sears right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="404.719" dur="6.42">closing about 40 stores including 31</text>
  <text start="407.36" dur="6.239">stores and 9k Mart&amp;#39;s and this the</text>
  <text start="411.139" dur="4.201">closing of the stores spans 24 states</text>
  <text start="413.599" dur="5.22">including Arizona California Florida</text>
  <text start="415.34" dur="5.97">Missouri Ohio and Minnesota and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="418.819" dur="4.621">closing a lot of stores they&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="421.31" dur="5.19">lot of troubles just like JC Penney and</text>
  <text start="423.44" dur="5.279">many of the other stores and once again</text>
  <text start="426.5" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re saying well this has to do with</text>
  <text start="428.719" dur="4.73">online and everything like that and if</text>
  <text start="430.55" dur="5.72">it truly was online we would see</text>
  <text start="433.449" dur="5.77">everyone taking their purchases and</text>
  <text start="436.27" dur="6.549">purchasing these items online and we</text>
  <text start="439.219" dur="5.161">would see online business doing much</text>
  <text start="442.819" dur="3.301">much better than it is today</text>
  <text start="444.38" dur="3.569">I mean it&amp;#39;s doing well and of course</text>
  <text start="446.12" dur="3.69">that&amp;#39;s going to gain ground as time goes</text>
  <text start="447.949" dur="3.9">on especially when we start introducing</text>
  <text start="449.81" dur="4.24">crypto currencies and other payment</text>
  <text start="451.849" dur="4.211">methods it&amp;#39;s going to really sky</text>
  <text start="454.05" dur="3.39">get but again you&amp;#39;re dealing with</text>
  <text start="456.06" dur="3.449">physical products you still have to get</text>
  <text start="457.44" dur="3.96">the physical products to the people and</text>
  <text start="459.509" dur="3.66">still people like to go to the stores</text>
  <text start="461.4" dur="3.049">and get their physical products they</text>
  <text start="463.169" dur="3.511">don&amp;#39;t want to wait for them</text>
  <text start="464.449" dur="4.391">yes delivery is getting a little bit</text>
  <text start="466.68" dur="4.65">better but once again it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="468.84" dur="3.99">physical it still takes a day or two to</text>
  <text start="471.33" dur="5.07">get your merchandise but we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="472.83" dur="5.809">many other stores they&amp;#39;re hurt by what</text>
  <text start="476.4" dur="5.22">is happening in the economy we see</text>

  <text start="489.87" dur="5.43">with that they just they&amp;#39;ve reached the</text>

  <text start="495.3" dur="5.19">is not going well for the stores they</text>
  <text start="498.539" dur="4.891">don&amp;#39;t know what to do and I think what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="500.49" dur="5.399">happening is people or not purchasing</text>
  <text start="503.43" dur="4.889">like they used to and they&amp;#39;re holding</text>

  <text start="512.61" dur="4.59">you know what I can do without this is</text>
  <text start="514.709" dur="4.351">what a lot of people start to do when</text>
  <text start="517.2" dur="3.57">they lose their jobs when they lose</text>

  <text start="680.069" dur="4.171">central bank they&amp;#39;re getting ready to</text>
  <text start="682.11" dur="5.39">raise interest rates once again here in</text>
  <text start="684.24" dur="7.199">the United States the LIBOR rate is</text>
  <text start="687.5" dur="6.67">rising very very quickly and this is a</text>
  <text start="691.439" dur="4.95">complete and utter disaster but this is</text>
  <text start="694.17" dur="5.39">the trajectory that we&amp;#39;re headed in this</text>
  <text start="696.389" dur="6.57">is being pushed in that direction to</text>
  <text start="699.56" dur="7.209">actually crash the central banking</text>
  <text start="702.959" dur="6.661">system everyone needs to understand that</text>
  <text start="706.769" dur="5.041">this is not a people driven system this</text>
  <text start="709.62" dur="5.399">is a system that the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="711.81" dur="6.81">created and convinced us over the many</text>
  <text start="715.019" dur="6.301">many many years that this is a great</text>
  <text start="718.62" dur="5.19">system we don&amp;#39;t need to be</text>
  <text start="721.32" dur="5.49">in this system this is their system</text>
  <text start="723.81" dur="5.49">where they enslave us where we have to</text>
  <text start="726.81" dur="5.76">pay taxes because we borrow the money</text>
  <text start="729.3" dur="6.57">with interest attached they convinced us</text>
  <text start="732.57" dur="5.61">over the many years to believe that this</text>
  <text start="735.87" dur="4.04">is normal that when debt Rises</text>
  <text start="738.18" dur="4.97">everything&amp;#39;s great</text>
  <text start="739.91" dur="5.35">you&amp;#39;re prosperous when debt Rises and</text>
  <text start="743.15" dur="3.94">that&amp;#39;s why the corporate media is out</text>
  <text start="745.26" dur="3.39">there always telling you well a lot of</text>
  <text start="747.09" dur="3.39">people spent a lot of money and put it</text>
  <text start="748.65" dur="4.26">on their credit cards debt is rising</text>
  <text start="750.48" dur="5.37">that&amp;#39;s good for the economy no it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="752.91" dur="5">as we can see in other countries it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="755.85" dur="5.85">terrible for the economy</text>
  <text start="757.91" dur="7.33">yes spending is good but not debt</text>
  <text start="761.7" dur="5.31">spending because you spend that money</text>
  <text start="765.24" dur="4.32">then you owe money with interest</text>
  <text start="767.01" dur="6.23">attached and guess what you can&amp;#39;t pay it</text>
  <text start="769.56" dur="6.42">so this is a complete and utter disaster</text>
  <text start="773.24" dur="5.71">for the United States for Canada</text>
  <text start="775.98" dur="6.24">Australia Europe for all the private</text>
  <text start="778.95" dur="6.03">Western Central Bank countries it cannot</text>
  <text start="782.22" dur="5.55">be sustained it&amp;#39;s impossible so how do</text>
  <text start="784.98" dur="5.82">you get out of this system well you can</text>
  <text start="787.77" dur="5.82">have all the states vote and say we do</text>
  <text start="790.8" dur="5.55">not want the central bank anymore you</text>
  <text start="793.59" dur="3.96">can go through the Congress they can</text>
  <text start="796.35" dur="4.5">vote but do you think they&amp;#39;re gonna vote</text>
  <text start="797.55" dur="6.9">in that way at this point no the</text>
  <text start="800.85" dur="6.18">corporate media the government officials</text>
  <text start="804.45" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re intertwined into the central</text>
  <text start="807.03" dur="4.38">banking system this is why the central</text>
  <text start="809.64" dur="4.47">banking system is lasted for such a long</text>
  <text start="811.41" dur="5.85">time how else can you get rid of it well</text>
  <text start="814.11" dur="6.96">you can crash their system and then say</text>
  <text start="817.26" dur="6.72">we have to restart it and say since it</text>
  <text start="821.07" dur="4.92">crashed we need to find out what the</text>
  <text start="823.98" dur="5.16">central bank has been doing all this</text>
  <text start="825.99" dur="4.38">time let&amp;#39;s maybe audit them remember</text>
  <text start="829.14" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re taking care of the country we</text>
  <text start="830.37" dur="6">should know what they&amp;#39;re doing it&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="832.47" dur="6.63">simple and the only way out right now is</text>
  <text start="836.37" dur="5.19">to crash it and this is why it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="839.1" dur="4.05">pushed to the edge and it will</text>
  <text start="841.56" dur="3.21">continually be pushed to the edge now</text>
  <text start="843.15" dur="4.35">the central bank&amp;#39;s they know their</text>
  <text start="844.77" dur="5.04">system can&amp;#39;t last that much longer they</text>
  <text start="847.5" dur="5.49">understand their system has a lifespan</text>
  <text start="849.81" dur="4.47">of 40 to 45 years maybe can maybe they</text>
  <text start="852.99" dur="2.19">can stretch it a little bit longer but</text>
  <text start="854.28" dur="3.06">that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="855.18" dur="4.38">and they know once the debt level</text>
  <text start="857.34" dur="6.45">reaches a certain point in an interest</text>
  <text start="859.56" dur="7.08">rates rise it&amp;#39;s game over as you can see</text>
  <text start="863.79" dur="4.98">the whole system&amp;#39;s breaking down people</text>
  <text start="866.64" dur="4.32">are living in an illusion right now if</text>
  <text start="868.77" dur="4.77">they think this system is going to last</text>
  <text start="870.96" dur="5.52">forever it doesn&amp;#39;t go back throughout</text>
  <text start="873.54" dur="4.95">history it&amp;#39;s been the same system it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="876.48" dur="3.87">been the central banking system there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="878.49" dur="3.81">been pockets when we didn&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="880.35" dur="3.9">central bank the private western central</text>
  <text start="882.3" dur="3.99">bank I should say but if you go back</text>
  <text start="884.25" dur="5.19">throughout time you can see that their</text>
  <text start="886.29" dur="5.34">system when they&amp;#39;re in control it</text>
  <text start="889.44" dur="4.14">doesn&amp;#39;t last and we see that the</text>
  <text start="891.63" dur="5.94">European banks right now they are in</text>
  <text start="893.58" dur="6.21">trouble and there is one problem for the</text>
  <text start="897.57" dur="5.04">euro that keeps on growing</text>
  <text start="899.79" dur="6.54">that&amp;#39;s the unresolved banking crisis in</text>
  <text start="902.61" dur="5.4">Europe and it&amp;#39;s not a small problem the</text>
  <text start="906.33" dur="3.93">euro system in your bank balance sheet</text>
  <text start="908.01" dur="4.92">total around 30 trillion euros in</text>

  <text start="915.9" dur="5.01">banks are in trouble trouble for several</text>
  <text start="918.09" dur="4.08">reasons first banking regulation has</text>
  <text start="920.91" dur="4.38">become tighter after the financial</text>
  <text start="922.17" dur="6.81">crisis second there are risks hidden in</text>
  <text start="925.29" dur="8.01">banks balance sheets third low interest</text>
  <text start="928.98" dur="7.59">rates have contributed to increase asset</text>
  <text start="933.3" dur="5.13">prices stocks and bonds have increased</text>
  <text start="936.57" dur="4.29">due to the monetary policy of the ECB</text>
  <text start="938.43" dur="4.83">thereby leading to accounting profits</text>
  <text start="940.86" dur="4.71">for banks monetary policy has thereby</text>
  <text start="943.26" dur="5.76">artificially propped up banking profits</text>
  <text start="945.57" dur="6.66">during the last years for according to</text>
  <text start="949.02" dur="4.86">the ECB non-performing loans loans where</text>
  <text start="952.23" dur="5.94">borrowers have fallen behind in their</text>
  <text start="953.88" dur="7.13">payments amount to 759 billion euros</text>
  <text start="958.17" dur="5.55">that is 30 percent of the bank&amp;#39;s equity</text>
  <text start="961.01" dur="5.38">when the interest rates increase in the</text>
  <text start="963.72" dur="4.86">future banks will be confronted with</text>
  <text start="966.39" dur="4.38">several difficulties and we see with the</text>
  <text start="968.58" dur="4.23">LIBOR with the Fed continually</text>
  <text start="970.77" dur="4.8">increasing rates they&amp;#39;re gonna be faced</text>
  <text start="972.81" dur="4.89">with this non-performing loans will</text>
  <text start="975.57" dur="5.1">increase and zombie companies will go</text>
  <text start="977.7" dur="4.44">bust banks long term low interest rate</text>
  <text start="980.67" dur="5.4">loans will become more difficult to</text>
  <text start="982.14" dur="6.629">refinance profitably asset prices will</text>
  <text start="986.07" dur="4.769">fall leading to losses government</text>
  <text start="988.769" dur="4.62">may get into trouble which they will</text>
  <text start="990.839" dur="5.1">this will then spread to other banks</text>
  <text start="993.389" dur="6.24">remember the derivatives are all tied</text>
  <text start="995.939" dur="6.661">into the entire system as a result of</text>
  <text start="999.629" dur="5.43">all this of all these losses banks will</text>
  <text start="1002.6" dur="4.469">be forced to restrict credits as their</text>
  <text start="1005.059" dur="5.551">equity shrinks this is where we get into</text>
  <text start="1007.069" dur="6.661">the credit crisis this is a no-win</text>
  <text start="1010.61" dur="3.899">situation central bankers understand</text>
  <text start="1013.73" dur="4.169">this why do you think they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1014.509" dur="5.55">keeping the interest rates so low it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1017.899" dur="4.17">not because oh they want to benefit the</text>
  <text start="1020.059" dur="4.5">everyday person they want to make it</text>
  <text start="1022.069" dur="4.791">easier for the everyday person no</text>
  <text start="1024.559" dur="6.331">they&amp;#39;re keeping their system together</text>
  <text start="1026.86" dur="6.76">long enough where they can move it to a</text>
