  <text start="118.1" dur="5.43">has no alternative well they actually do</text>
  <text start="121.7" dur="3.69">have an alternative but they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="123.53" dur="5.01">going to go against the central bankers</text>
  <text start="125.39" dur="4.61">it looks like sybaris back down he</text>
  <text start="128.54" dur="4.979">didn&amp;#39;t care what the people had to say</text>
  <text start="130" dur="6.01">so he didn&amp;#39;t push on this and he folded</text>
  <text start="133.519" dur="5.19">and we see right now he is ready to</text>
  <text start="136.01" dur="4.47">clean out the government and make a</text>
  <text start="138.709" dur="4.081">clean start he wants all those people</text>
  <text start="140.48" dur="4.319">who do not agree with him out of</text>
  <text start="142.79" dur="6.449">government and it&amp;#39;s starting to look</text>
  <text start="144.799" dur="6.601">like this is what is happening and we</text>
  <text start="149.239" dur="5.191">see right now which I reported on</text>
  <text start="151.4" dur="6.75">yesterday from the Greek reporter where</text>
  <text start="154.43" dur="6.12">sybaris and Vera Farkas both said that</text>
  <text start="158.15" dur="4.02">they went to Putin and they said listen</text>
  <text start="160.55" dur="2.9">we would like 10 billion dollars to back</text>
  <text start="162.17" dur="3.959">the drachma</text>
  <text start="163.45" dur="4.569">this way we can leave the eurozone we</text>
  <text start="166.129" dur="3.871">can have our own currency but we need</text>
  <text start="168.019" dur="4.231">the backing they went to China it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="170" dur="4.319">happen Russia is out there right now</text>
  <text start="172.25" dur="5.489">saying they did they&amp;#39;re denying all this</text>
  <text start="174.319" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;re saying tsipras never asked Putin</text>
  <text start="177.739" dur="5.881">for 10 billion to print the drachma so</text>
  <text start="180.829" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re saying this never happened now</text>
  <text start="183.62" dur="6.57">maybe what this was their plan maybe</text>
  <text start="186.019" dur="5.58">this is what they wanted to do but there</text>
  <text start="190.19" dur="5.6">seems to be a little bit of a confusion</text>
  <text start="191.599" dur="8.25">we know that Putin was going to advance</text>
  <text start="195.79" dur="6.309">greece five billion and Greece was</text>
  <text start="199.849" dur="3.841">looking for the other five billion in</text>
  <text start="202.099" dur="4.681">other places but they just couldn&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="203.69" dur="5.219">it and it seems at this point in time</text>
  <text start="206.78" dur="6.829">they had no other he had no other place</text>
  <text start="208.909" dur="7.561">to go he had no other alternatives and</text>
  <text start="213.609" dur="5.291">basically went along with a deal which</text>
  <text start="216.47" dur="5.28">was much much worse than what the people</text>
  <text start="218.9" dur="6.3">were voting on and right now he&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="221.75" dur="6.78">there telling the syriza party listen if</text>
  <text start="225.2" dur="6.81">you have a better plan and you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="228.53" dur="6">like this deal show it to me but you</text>
  <text start="232.01" dur="6.15">know what everyone is too afraid to do</text>
  <text start="234.53" dur="5.31">this I personally think they should go</text>
  <text start="238.16" dur="5.219">out on their own take their chances</text>
  <text start="239.84" dur="7.86">because you know why this situation is a</text>
  <text start="243.379" dur="6.33">dead end its debt piled on debt it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="247.7" dur="5.249">more austerity the country&amp;#39;s being sold</text>
  <text start="249.709" dur="7.191">off it&amp;#39;s a no-win situation the only</text>
  <text start="252.949" dur="7.021">winners are the creditors that&amp;#39;s it and</text>
  <text start="256.9" dur="5.62">Greece is not the only country that has</text>
  <text start="259.97" dur="8.37">a huge amount of debt I mean the</text>
  <text start="262.52" dur="7.709">European debt just hit a record high it</text>
  <text start="268.34" dur="4.53">went from nine point three trillion</text>
  <text start="270.229" dur="6.06">euros up to nine point four trillion</text>
  <text start="272.87" dur="6.299">euros it&amp;#39;s a new record high now if we</text>
  <text start="276.289" dur="6.031">look at debt to GDP think about this for</text>

  <text start="343.149" dur="4.23">move along this way when we go back to</text>
  <text start="345.039" dur="4.14">2013 and we heard the eurozone out there</text>
  <text start="347.379" dur="3.03">telling us that we were in this recovery</text>

  <text start="436.189" dur="4.26">time quite a while this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="438.619" dur="3.51">losing manufacturing this is why</text>
  <text start="440.449" dur="4.86">companies are moving out of the United</text>

  <text start="449.029" dur="4.23">economic indicators they&amp;#39;re pointing to</text>
  <text start="451.399" dur="5.07">something and that is a complete</text>
  <text start="453.259" dur="6.78">collapse of the system I mean we talked</text>
  <text start="456.469" dur="6.361">about caterpillar quite a bit and when</text>
  <text start="460.039" dur="4.8">we look at caterpillar back in June we</text>
  <text start="462.83" dur="6.899">saw a negative nineteen percent drop in</text>
  <text start="464.839" dur="7.021">asian pacific sales US retail sales</text>
  <text start="469.729" dur="4.98">posted their first year to year decline</text>
  <text start="471.86" dur="4.949">since februari dropping five percent but</text>
  <text start="474.709" dur="4.95">the real depression is in Latin America</text>
  <text start="476.809" dur="5.85">where cat retail sales plummeted by</text>
  <text start="479.659" dur="6.66">fifty percent the most in reported</text>
  <text start="482.659" dur="7.201">history and then we saw an eighteen</text>
  <text start="486.319" dur="5.52">percent drop earlier this year but</text>
  <text start="489.86" dur="8.759">what&amp;#39;s more disturbing about all of this</text>
  <text start="491.839" dur="10.2">is that the sales for Caterpillar they</text>
  <text start="498.619" dur="6.3">are now worse than they were back in the</text>
  <text start="502.039" dur="10.47">collapse when it happened in 2008 they</text>
  <text start="504.919" dur="14.52">had 19 months of sales declining now we</text>
  <text start="512.509" dur="12.901">have 31 months during the recovery so</text>
  <text start="519.439" dur="9.781">during 2008 going to about 2010 almost</text>
  <text start="525.41" dur="9.15">2011 it was 19 months during that Great</text>
  <text start="529.22" dur="8.94">Recession the end of 2012 to the present</text>
  <text start="534.56" dur="8.73">day during this incredible recovery we</text>
  <text start="538.16" dur="8.099">have 31 months of negative sales does</text>
  <text start="543.29" dur="8.669">this sound like a recovery no it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="546.259" dur="9.33">and we understand retail is not doing</text>
  <text start="551.959" dur="6.36">any better whatsoever retail in America</text>
  <text start="555.589" dur="6.031">is completely collapsing on itself and</text>
  <text start="558.319" dur="5.341">of course they&amp;#39;re making excuses that no</text>
  <text start="561.62" dur="5.46">it was the weather</text>
  <text start="563.66" dur="5.97">the Sun is too hot in the summer online</text>
  <text start="567.08" dur="3.75">sales are picking up the slack well if</text>
  <text start="569.63" dur="3.84">that is true we&amp;#39;d see a direct</text>
  <text start="570.83" dur="4.47">correlation between the reducing the</text>
  <text start="573.47" dur="3.72">decline in sales in brick and mortar</text>
  <text start="575.3" dur="4.08">shops and we would see the rise in</text>
  <text start="577.19" dur="5.33">online sales but we do not see that</text>
  <text start="579.38" dur="5.99">whatsoever that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s missing and</text>
  <text start="582.52" dur="4.96">right now the National Retail Federation</text>
  <text start="585.37" dur="4.45">they&amp;#39;ve already told us that you had</text>
  <text start="587.48" dur="3.24">these back-to-school sales they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="589.82" dur="3.03">going to be good they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="590.72" dur="3.57">about nine percent below they gave some</text>
  <text start="592.85" dur="4.71">excuses of why this is going to happen</text>
  <text start="594.29" dur="4.98">because people are just you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="597.56" dur="4.23">just not going out and purchasing right</text>
  <text start="599.27" dur="5.28">now because of the heat or whatever</text>
  <text start="601.79" dur="5.85">other excuse they&amp;#39;re using but right now</text>
  <text start="604.55" dur="7.11">they&amp;#39;re slashing their outlook for the</text>
  <text start="607.64" dur="5.61">rest of the year by fifteen percent so</text>
  <text start="611.66" dur="4.98">they went from a four point one percent</text>
  <text start="613.25" dur="6.06">growth now to a three and a half percent</text>
  <text start="616.64" dur="6.45">growth and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if</text>
  <text start="619.31" dur="6.54">they go lower than that the excuse</text>
  <text start="623.09" dur="4.98">reason for this markdown spending has</text>
  <text start="625.85" dur="5.52">been hampered by lackluster growth in</text>
  <text start="628.07" dur="7.88">our economy I guess they just admitted</text>
  <text start="631.37" dur="7.47">that the economy is not doing well of</text>
  <text start="635.95" dur="6.01">course as we know the US government</text>
  <text start="638.84" dur="5.19">central bankers they push gas prices</text>
  <text start="641.96" dur="3.96">down we know this was for many different</text>

  <text start="645.92" dur="4.98">economies of Russia they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="648.53" dur="5.13">get people to use that extra money they</text>
  <text start="650.9" dur="5.1">have and go out and purchase these goods</text>
  <text start="653.66" dur="8.06">at the retail shops but it is not</text>
  <text start="656" dur="10.41">working we see that all of this is</text>
  <text start="661.72" dur="6.13">falling apart people are not taking</text>
  <text start="666.41" dur="4.17">their extra money because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="667.85" dur="4.71">have extra money most of the people are</text>

  <text start="1182.97" dur="4.68">up now you now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="1184.559" dur="5.941">about this is lawrence yun the national</text>
  <text start="1187.65" dur="5.7">association of realtors chief economist</text>
  <text start="1190.5" dur="4.11">and he predicted everything prior to two</text>

  <text start="1194.61" dur="4.02">wrong saying that real estate is going</text>
  <text start="1196.59" dur="3.469">to pick up at the end of two thousand</text>

  <text start="1206.82" dur="4.05">thousand eight going forward all those</text>
  <text start="1209.49" dur="3.86">predictions were completely wrong and</text>
  <text start="1210.87" dur="5.28">don&amp;#39;t worry he&amp;#39;s out there once again</text>
  <text start="1213.35" dur="5.949">he&amp;#39;s saying that this wave of demand is</text>

  <text start="1225.63" dur="4.65">wherewithal and incentive to buy well</text>
  <text start="1229.14" dur="2.55">that&amp;#39;s very interesting that he said</text>
  <text start="1230.28" dur="4.2">this because</text>
  <text start="1231.69" dur="4.41">what confuses me is that while he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1234.48" dur="5.85">saying that and American people are out</text>
  <text start="1236.1" dur="8.699">there purchasing why aren&amp;#39;t mortgage</text>
  <text start="1240.33" dur="7.92">applications skyrocketing hmm we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1244.799" dur="5.1">missing that piece of the puzzle today</text>
  <text start="1248.25" dur="4.799">they came out and said all mortgage</text>
  <text start="1249.899" dur="8.041">applications they&amp;#39;ve gone up they went</text>
  <text start="1253.049" dur="9.901">up point one percent a week ago they</text>
  <text start="1257.94" dur="8.579">dropped double-digit something isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1262.95" dur="5.64">right because if Americans are out there</text>
  <text start="1266.519" dur="4.65">and i&amp;#39;m sure most Americans do not have</text>
  <text start="1268.59" dur="5.13">cash on hand just to go out and put down</text>
  <text start="1271.169" dur="5.401">300 400 500 thousand dollars on a house</text>
