  <text start="57.38" dur="5.64">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.85" dur="6.93">episode 1298 a and today&amp;#39;s date is June</text>
  <text start="63.02" dur="6.38">5th 2017 and the thought of the episode</text>
  <text start="65.78" dur="7.92">is IMF warns US economy uncertain as</text>
  <text start="69.4" dur="6.43">China&amp;#39;s credit growth poses a risk let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="73.7" dur="4.02">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="75.83" dur="3.84">news now we&amp;#39;ve been looking at many</text>
  <text start="77.72" dur="3.45">different sectors in the economy one of</text>
  <text start="79.67" dur="4.08">them being real estate why because real</text>
  <text start="81.17" dur="5.93">estate affects a lot of different things</text>
  <text start="83.75" dur="8.46">it affects electricians construction</text>
  <text start="87.1" dur="6.85">production of lumber cement steel I mean</text>
  <text start="92.21" dur="2.94">there&amp;#39;s a lot associated with real</text>
  <text start="93.95" dur="4.41">estate especially when you&amp;#39;re building a</text>
  <text start="95.15" dur="5.28">new home and it also goes with what</text>
  <text start="98.36" dur="5.1">people are doing how people feel</text>
  <text start="100.43" dur="5.88">comfortable and what they think of the</text>
  <text start="103.46" dur="5.159">economy and of course the central</text>
  <text start="106.31" dur="4.47">bankers use real estate as a gate and</text>
  <text start="108.619" dur="5.25">they blow up bubbles to make people</text>
  <text start="110.78" dur="6.089">think and feel good about their housing</text>
  <text start="113.869" dur="5.971">their houses appreciating in value and</text>
  <text start="116.869" dur="6">when your house appreciates in value you</text>
  <text start="119.84" dur="4.71">feel a lot better about doing different</text>
  <text start="122.869" dur="3.03">things even though the appreciation is</text>
  <text start="124.55" dur="3.75">on paper and it&amp;#39;s really meaningless</text>
  <text start="125.899" dur="4.441">until you go to sell people just feel</text>
  <text start="128.3" dur="3.81">really good about themselves when they</text>
  <text start="130.34" dur="3.69">say oh look my house went up fifty</text>
  <text start="132.11" dur="3.959">thousand dollars I feel a lot better</text>
  <text start="134.03" dur="3.48">because those individuals who have their</text>
  <text start="136.069" dur="3">house you know decrease by a hundred</text>
  <text start="137.51" dur="2.67">thousand they don&amp;#39;t feel too good</text>
  <text start="139.069" dur="3.781">because they feel like they&amp;#39;re paying a</text>
  <text start="140.18" dur="4.65">mortgage on a home where they paid a lot</text>
  <text start="142.85" dur="4.89">more than they should have and now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="144.83" dur="5.52">worth less twenty people don&amp;#39;t feel like</text>
  <text start="147.74" dur="4.41">that with a car because as soon as you</text>
  <text start="150.35" dur="3.27">drive the car off the lot it devalues</text>
  <text start="152.15" dur="3.99">but a lot of people rent their car</text>
  <text start="153.62" dur="4.83">through leasing today but that&amp;#39;s a whole</text>
  <text start="156.14" dur="6.209">different story what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="158.45" dur="8.34">now in the housing market and this is up</text>
  <text start="162.349" dur="6.241">in Canada the Toronto area this is one</text>
  <text start="166.79" dur="5.49">of the areas where there is this huge</text>
  <text start="168.59" dur="5.7">real estate bubble and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="172.28" dur="3.569">right now that residential property</text>
  <text start="174.29" dur="4.89">sales in Greater Toronto plunge by</text>
  <text start="175.849" dur="6.601">twenty percent this month last month May</text>
  <text start="179.18" dur="7.2">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="182.45" dur="6.21">things are rapidly turning around</text>
  <text start="186.38" dur="4.32">and the Toronto real estate board</text>
  <text start="188.66" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re looking at the sales and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="190.7" dur="5.04">dropped condos have dropped by six point</text>
  <text start="193.07" dur="5.46">four six point four percent and detached</text>
  <text start="195.74" dur="6.39">homes they plunged by twenty six point</text>
  <text start="198.53" dur="7.29">three percent which is quite a bit now</text>
  <text start="202.13" dur="5.67">at the same time new listings the new</text>
  <text start="205.82" dur="4.47">supply suddenly coming out of the</text>
  <text start="207.8" dur="5.61">Woodworks soared nearly fifty percent</text>
  <text start="210.29" dur="6.63">year-over-year now the report that came</text>
  <text start="213.41" dur="6.24">out they try to put a very positive spin</text>
  <text start="216.92" dur="5.04">on all the same homeowners after a</text>
  <text start="219.65" dur="4.11">protracted delay or starting to react to</text>
  <text start="221.96" dur="4.05">the strong price growth we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="223.76" dur="4.14">experienced over the past year by</text>
  <text start="226.01" dur="5.85">listing their home for sale to take</text>
  <text start="227.9" dur="6.63">advantage of these equity gains now when</text>
  <text start="231.86" dur="4.59">we look at this there&amp;#39;s a lot of people</text>
  <text start="234.53" dur="4.98">putting their house up for sale and I</text>
  <text start="236.45" dur="4.92">see this in my area in the United States</text>
  <text start="239.51" dur="4.59">where all of a sudden all these homes</text>
  <text start="241.37" dur="5.64">are for sale and guess what they are not</text>
  <text start="244.1" dur="5.73">selling no traffic is coming to these</text>
  <text start="247.01" dur="4.68">homes right now but there&amp;#39;s a lot on one</text>
  <text start="249.83" dur="4.59">block the same thing we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="251.69" dur="4.14">same exact thing in Toronto but there</text>
  <text start="254.42" dur="3.75">are three things that are happening in</text>
  <text start="255.83" dur="4.76">Canada right now one we talked about is</text>
  <text start="258.17" dur="5.85">the home Capital Group now this</text>
  <text start="260.59" dur="5.89">financial institution caters to subprime</text>
  <text start="264.02" dur="5.07">borrowers and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="266.48" dur="6.75">a lot of the deposits in this financial</text>
  <text start="269.09" dur="5.64">institution well they have left and we</text>
  <text start="273.23" dur="4.29">can see that they can&amp;#39;t get any more</text>
  <text start="274.73" dur="5.01">funding and we can see this is one</text>
  <text start="277.52" dur="4.26">particular thing in Canada right now</text>
  <text start="279.74" dur="3.99">which is troubling because what is</text>
  <text start="281.78" dur="4.95">happening is they&amp;#39;re very nervous that</text>
  <text start="283.73" dur="6.21">this is going to spread now the other</text>
  <text start="286.73" dur="5.7">thing is that the provincial government</text>
  <text start="289.94" dur="5.7">of Ontario announced a laundry list of</text>
  <text start="292.43" dur="5.91">measures including a 15 percent tax on</text>
  <text start="295.64" dur="5.1">purchases by non-resident foreign</text>
  <text start="298.34" dur="5.46">investors and this has caused a problem</text>
  <text start="300.74" dur="6.06">in the area and again what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="303.8" dur="5.46">right now is out in Toronto which it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="306.8" dur="4.47">starting to look like 2008 when you walk</text>
  <text start="309.26" dur="3.84">down the street and you see this houses</text>
  <text start="311.27" dur="4.44">for the sale this house is for sale this</text>
  <text start="313.1" dur="4.98">house is for sale and there&amp;#39;s no one</text>
  <text start="315.71" dur="4.229">coming to purchase these homes</text>
  <text start="318.08" dur="4.53">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is the same thing</text>
  <text start="319.939" dur="4.051">happening in Toronto and if you go onto</text>
  <text start="322.61" dur="3.929">Zillow and you look at many different</text>
  <text start="323.99" dur="4.709">neighborhoods around the country you can</text>
  <text start="326.539" dur="4.801">see the same thing actually you can zoom</text>
  <text start="328.699" dur="5.4">in and you can see how many houses are</text>
  <text start="331.34" dur="6.479">for sale on the one block and then you</text>
  <text start="334.099" dur="7.021">can see how they drop the prices over a</text>
  <text start="337.819" dur="6.541">certain period of time and still they</text>
  <text start="341.12" dur="6.06">haven&amp;#39;t sold so we&amp;#39;re seeing a major</text>
  <text start="344.36" dur="6.42">major problem and this is going to</text>
  <text start="347.18" dur="4.65">spread just like it did in 2008 and when</text>
  <text start="350.78" dur="4.41">we start to put everything together</text>
  <text start="351.83" dur="5.73">where we see retail which is completely</text>
  <text start="355.19" dur="4.65">contracting on itself it&amp;#39;s imploding</text>
  <text start="357.56" dur="5.039">right now with all these stores closing</text>
  <text start="359.84" dur="4.979">down with stores going bankrupt and</text>
  <text start="362.599" dur="4.261">pretty soon we&amp;#39;re going to see empty</text>
  <text start="364.819" dur="5.011">malls we&amp;#39;re going to see empty strip</text>
  <text start="366.86" dur="5.13">malls and a lot of these stores will no</text>
  <text start="369.83" dur="4.739">longer exist that you&amp;#39;ve been shopping</text>
  <text start="371.99" dur="4.049">at for a very long time now it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="374.569" dur="4.681">mean that everyone&amp;#39;s taking their cash</text>
  <text start="376.039" dur="4.5">and going to the online market where</text>
  <text start="379.25" dur="3.509">they&amp;#39;re going to Amazon and all these</text>
  <text start="380.539" dur="7.5">places because again online sales is</text>
  <text start="382.759" dur="9.361">only 8% of the entire retail industry</text>
  <text start="388.039" dur="6.451">what this tells us is that people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="392.12" dur="5.669">have the funds to go out and purchase</text>
  <text start="394.49" dur="6.06">like they used to they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="397.789" dur="5.49">extra funds because they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="400.55" dur="4.919">high paying job they&amp;#39;re getting laid off</text>
  <text start="403.279" dur="3.621">maybe they can find a job maybe they</text>
  <text start="405.469" dur="3.781">can&amp;#39;t maybe they take a part-time job</text>
  <text start="406.9" dur="4.9">maybe as a bartender a waiter or</text>
  <text start="409.25" dur="4.71">waitress and they just have enough to</text>
  <text start="411.8" dur="4.26">live and many times it&amp;#39;s not even enough</text>
  <text start="413.96" dur="5.31">to live so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="416.06" dur="7.38">is an incredible implosion of the entire</text>
  <text start="419.27" dur="7.04">system and we can see that since 2008 up</text>
  <text start="423.44" dur="5.339">into this point things have gotten worse</text>
  <text start="426.31" dur="4.81">over time I mean think about it</text>
  <text start="428.779" dur="4.711">go back to 2008 for a second yes we had</text>
  <text start="431.12" dur="4.56">bankruptcies we had stores closing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="433.49" dur="3.72">in this recovery right they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="435.68" dur="3.989">telling us how great the economy has</text>
  <text start="437.21" dur="4.379">been doing under Obama and the central</text>
  <text start="439.669" dur="3.12">bank is saying go unemployment is very</text>
  <text start="441.589" dur="3.54">low we&amp;#39;re going to be raising the</text>
  <text start="442.789" dur="4.651">interest rates and here we are in 2017</text>
  <text start="445.129" dur="5.22">have you ever seen a recovery where we</text>
  <text start="447.44" dur="4.26">had so many stores going bankrupt so</text>
  <text start="450.349" dur="4.921">many stores closed in</text>
  <text start="451.7" dur="5.85">so many businesses laying off I mean</text>
  <text start="455.27" dur="4.44">does it make any sense where the</text>
  <text start="457.55" dur="5.64">productivity of the United States</text>
  <text start="459.71" dur="5.4">continually declines during a recovery</text>
  <text start="463.19" dur="4.05">like this where they&amp;#39;re telling us that</text>
  <text start="465.11" dur="4.14">everything is fine and the stock market</text>
  <text start="467.24" dur="6.24">continually moves up and up and up</text>
  <text start="469.25" dur="7.44">no we&amp;#39;re living in this world which is a</text>
  <text start="473.48" dur="5.58">complete illusion the central bank can</text>
  <text start="476.69" dur="4.8">create an illusion make everyone believe</text>
  <text start="479.06" dur="5.1">in the illusion and then they can crash</text>
  <text start="481.49" dur="5.58">the illusion and this is what they have</text>
  <text start="484.16" dur="5.85">done they&amp;#39;ve created this illusion and</text>
  <text start="487.07" dur="6.03">people really believe that this economy</text>
  <text start="490.01" dur="7.35">is strong and it&amp;#39;s going to be okay</text>
  <text start="493.1" dur="6.3">forever and it&amp;#39;s not we see something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="497.36" dur="5.22">all over the place where things are</text>
  <text start="499.4" dur="6.09">rapidly falling apart all you need to do</text>
  <text start="502.58" dur="5.22">is open your eyes take a look and see</text>
  <text start="505.49" dur="4.95">and think to yourself why would this be</text>
  <text start="507.8" dur="5.04">happening now I mean really look at the</text>
  <text start="510.44" dur="4.14">numbers I know the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="512.84" dur="3.42">saying oh it&amp;#39;s all because of online</text>
  <text start="514.58" dur="4.44">they keep saying that to convince you</text>
  <text start="516.26" dur="5.7">over and over and over but look at the</text>
  <text start="519.02" dur="6.09">numbers wouldn&amp;#39;t we see all those</text>
  <text start="521.96" dur="4.59">dollars going into online businesses</text>
  <text start="525.11" dur="4.71">limit doesn&amp;#39;t all the brick-and-mortar</text>
  <text start="526.55" dur="5.88">stores have online businesses we would</text>
  <text start="529.82" dur="5.19">see the dollars maybe not all of it move</text>
  <text start="532.43" dur="4.95">right into online businesses but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="535.01" dur="6.63">not seeing that whatsoever we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="537.38" dur="7.95">that us productivity well it is stalled</text>
  <text start="541.64" dur="6.8">right now and this is the second quarter</text>
  <text start="545.33" dur="5.34">in a row where it is not improved and</text>
  <text start="548.44" dur="6.16">eventually what is going to happen just</text>
  <text start="550.67" dur="6.45">like in 2008 it&amp;#39;s going to decline now</text>
  <text start="554.6" dur="5.58">we&amp;#39;ve been following Banco Popular and</text>
  <text start="557.12" dur="5.28">we understand from well they told the</text>
  <text start="560.18" dur="3.87">employees don&amp;#39;t panic the central bank</text>
  <text start="562.4" dur="3.69">is saying don&amp;#39;t panic everything&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="564.05" dur="4.53">to be okay and we know when they come</text>
  <text start="566.09" dur="4.95">out with don&amp;#39;t panic and need things are</text>
  <text start="568.58" dur="5.88">really bad and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="571.04" dur="5.67">now is that the banks credit curve well</text>
  <text start="574.46" dur="5.75">it has inverted for the first time since</text>
  <text start="576.71" dur="7.11">2012 and this is a huge red flag that</text>
  <text start="580.21" dur="5.08">Spain&amp;#39;s banking crisis is systemic and</text>
  <text start="583.82" dur="5.46">about to test</text>
  <text start="585.29" dur="7.68">the --use bail-in laws and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="589.28" dur="6.21">seeing is that the bank is imploding on</text>
  <text start="592.97" dur="6.66">itself but there are rumors right now</text>
  <text start="595.49" dur="6.48">that there might be a consortium of</text>
  <text start="599.63" dur="4.38">Latin American investors which are</text>
  <text start="601.97" dur="5.97">planning to take over the bank they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="604.01" dur="6.54">just waiting for their share price to be</text>
  <text start="607.94" dur="6.03">very very low before they step in and</text>
  <text start="610.55" dur="5.79">again this is rumors but I can tell</text>
  <text start="613.97" dur="5.55">already that they&amp;#39;re looking for some</text>
  <text start="616.34" dur="5.76">type of funding to take over this</text>
  <text start="619.52" dur="5.97">banking system because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="622.1" dur="5.13">this to crash just yet they want to keep</text>
  <text start="625.49" dur="3.33">the system alive and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="627.23" dur="3.96">try to save as much as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="628.82" dur="5.7">the point where we see Banco Popular</text>
  <text start="631.19" dur="5.85">Deutsche Bank and air in an Italian Bank</text>
  <text start="634.52" dur="4.56">all start to go at the same time this is</text>
  <text start="637.04" dur="4.35">when the big problems going to be so</text>
  <text start="639.08" dur="4.95">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is what we</text>
  <text start="641.39" dur="8.45">saw here in the US with like Bear</text>
  <text start="644.03" dur="7.92">Stearns with Lehman AIG where oh</text>
  <text start="649.84" dur="2.59">something&amp;#39;s failing but don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="651.95" dur="3.21">about it</text>
  <text start="652.43" dur="4.53">oh that home mortgage company up in</text>
  <text start="655.16" dur="3.84">Canada it&amp;#39;s failing don&amp;#39;t worry about it</text>
  <text start="656.96" dur="4.68">these are all the signs that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="659" dur="5.07">looking at right now and we can see if</text>
  <text start="661.64" dur="3.9">this is going to fail another one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="664.07" dur="2.64">going to fail and if that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="665.54" dur="3">fail another one it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
