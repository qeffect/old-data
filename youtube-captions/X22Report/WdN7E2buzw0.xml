  <text start="151.989" dur="6.801">they just pay their student loans what&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="188.8" dur="4.95">month but they just can&amp;#39;t do it this is</text>

  <text start="193.75" dur="3.96">listen we&amp;#39;ll adjust the payments</text>
  <text start="195.88" dur="5.12">according to what you&amp;#39;re making and</text>
  <text start="197.71" dur="6.39">we&amp;#39;ll spread it out maybe 20 25 years</text>

  <text start="278.35" dur="7.23">home those who are coming out of college</text>
  <text start="281.56" dur="8.79">why can&amp;#39;t they find jobs because once</text>
  <text start="285.58" dur="8.25">again it&amp;#39;s not what it seems and we can</text>
  <text start="290.35" dur="7.11">see right now that this is what happened</text>
  <text start="293.83" dur="6.899">after the depression they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="297.46" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;re in a recovery well everything that</text>

  <text start="314.889" dur="8.34">jobs are going to completely disappear</text>
  <text start="317.71" dur="8.91">and we see right now that things are not</text>
  <text start="323.229" dur="9.171">getting better where we&amp;#39;re going to that</text>
  <text start="326.62" dur="8.34">area where we were in 2008 where</text>
  <text start="332.4" dur="5.889">economic indicators are showing that</text>

  <text start="343.21" dur="5.669">that Americans they&amp;#39;re going to exceed</text>
  <text start="346.81" dur="4.979">the amount of credit card debt they</text>
  <text start="348.879" dur="6.81">racked up during the Great Recession so</text>
  <text start="351.789" dur="6.541">we have the young adults living with mom</text>

  <text start="370.629" dur="4.56">cards and racked up the same amount same</text>
  <text start="372.729" dur="5.581">amount of debt that they did during the</text>
  <text start="375.189" dur="7.35">Great Recession right now the average</text>
  <text start="378.31" dur="8.039">household debt is about 16,000 61 up ten</text>
  <text start="382.539" dur="5.49">percent from 14,000 546 ten years ago</text>

  <text start="388.029" dur="4.35">sixty-two last year and this is coming</text>
  <text start="390.61" dur="3.72">from an analysis from the federal</text>
  <text start="392.379" dur="5.01">reserve bank of new york and the US</text>
  <text start="394.33" dur="5.1">census bureau data the total debt</text>
  <text start="397.389" dur="5.01">including mortgages auto loan student</text>
  <text start="399.43" dur="4.229">loans is expected to surpass the amount</text>
  <text start="402.399" dur="5.911">owed at the beginning of the Great</text>
  <text start="403.659" dur="8.1">Recession by the end of 2016 and we can</text>
  <text start="408.31" dur="8.31">see right now that the amount of total</text>
  <text start="411.759" dur="10.47">household debt is twelve point four</text>
  <text start="416.62" dur="10.049">trillion in 2010 it was eleven point</text>
  <text start="422.229" dur="7.951">seven trillion we&amp;#39;re heading back to the</text>
  <text start="426.669" dur="5.22">same exact problems why is credit card</text>
  <text start="430.18" dur="3.659">debt moving up because people are having</text>
  <text start="431.889" dur="4.59">a very difficult time surviving they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="433.839" dur="4.35">not making enough money with their</text>
  <text start="436.479" dur="5.011">part-time jobs remember when you have a</text>
  <text start="438.189" dur="5.28">full-time job you have a certain way of</text>
  <text start="441.49" dur="4.5">life you have your car payment you have</text>
  <text start="443.469" dur="4.98">your house payment you have your other</text>
  <text start="445.99" dur="2.76">monthly payments and when you lose that</text>
  <text start="448.449" dur="2.011">job</text>
  <text start="448.75" dur="3.33">and you can&amp;#39;t find the job making the</text>
  <text start="450.46" dur="3.75">same amount of money and you take a part</text>
  <text start="452.08" dur="4.98">time job or the same type of job making</text>
  <text start="454.21" dur="5.04">less money your problems affording all</text>
  <text start="457.06" dur="6">of these things now yes you can cut down</text>
  <text start="459.25" dur="6.42">on Netflix you can get rid of that you</text>
  <text start="463.06" dur="5.1">can get rid of amazon prime and get rid</text>
  <text start="465.67" dur="4.86">of that but the water bill stays the</text>
  <text start="468.16" dur="4.56">electric bill stays if you&amp;#39;re living in</text>
  <text start="470.53" dur="4.68">a house the mortgage stays if you have</text>
  <text start="472.72" dur="5.64">cars that your financing or leasing</text>
  <text start="475.21" dur="6.18">those payments stay insurance stays</text>
  <text start="478.36" dur="5.52">health insurance stays and it becomes</text>
  <text start="481.39" dur="4.83">very very difficult to get through all</text>
  <text start="483.88" dur="4.74">of this and this is what people are</text>
  <text start="486.22" dur="4.11">finding out right now today in the</text>
  <text start="488.62" dur="4.62">corporate media they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="490.33" dur="5.64">pushing the idea that existing home</text>
  <text start="493.24" dur="5.28">sales while they&amp;#39;re surging like we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="495.97" dur="3.6">never seen before which is strange</text>
  <text start="498.52" dur="4.02">because mortgage rates are increasing</text>
  <text start="499.57" dur="5.22">morge applications have declined quite a</text>
  <text start="502.54" dur="5.51">bit but existing home sales aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="504.79" dur="6.12">increasing now one explanation is that</text>
  <text start="508.05" dur="4.78">well they only look at 20 cities and</text>
  <text start="510.91" dur="3.27">they look at this and they say okay</text>
  <text start="512.83" dur="3.81">let&amp;#39;s see what&amp;#39;s happening in this area</text>
  <text start="514.18" dur="3.659">and of course they do have hedge fund</text>
  <text start="516.64" dur="3.959">investment companies out there</text>
  <text start="517.839" dur="5.041">purchasing homes to create this type of</text>
  <text start="520.599" dur="4.711">information but when we look outside of</text>
  <text start="522.88" dur="6.87">the 20 cities what do we say we see</text>
  <text start="525.31" dur="6.87">houses on the market for a very long</text>
  <text start="529.75" dur="5.94">time and people are lowering their</text>
  <text start="532.18" dur="6.72">prices 10,000 12,000 15,000 houses are</text>
  <text start="535.69" dur="5.25">on the market eight nine months the</text>
  <text start="538.9" dur="4.26">other explanation is people are saying</text>
  <text start="540.94" dur="4.2">okay I see the interest rates rising let</text>
  <text start="543.16" dur="6.35">me just lock in where I am and purchase</text>
  <text start="545.14" dur="7.41">this house before rates go up once again</text>
  <text start="549.51" dur="4.39">now these are the two arguments I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="552.55" dur="3.36">going to go with the first one because</text>
  <text start="553.9" dur="4.29">right now I know from looking at the</text>
  <text start="555.91" dur="4.38">data that when interest rates moved up</text>
  <text start="558.19" dur="4.77">mortgage applications decline quite a</text>
  <text start="560.29" dur="5.73">bit and it kicked many individuals out</text>
  <text start="562.96" dur="5.22">of the market millions of people so what</text>
  <text start="566.02" dur="3.63">I&amp;#39;m seeing here right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="568.18" dur="3.45">manipulating these numbers looking at</text>
  <text start="569.65" dur="9.42">the 20 cities and just looking at that</text>
  <text start="571.63" dur="10.649">only we see out in Europe well the</text>
  <text start="579.07" dur="6.9">Italian banks they are in big trouble</text>
  <text start="582.279" dur="5.91">looks like the government in Italy</text>
  <text start="585.97" dur="3.779">they&amp;#39;re going to be stepping in looks</text>
  <text start="588.189" dur="5.25">like they&amp;#39;re going to be using about 20</text>
  <text start="589.749" dur="7.53">billion euros to bail out some of the</text>
  <text start="593.439" dur="6.931">junior bondholders and we can see this</text>
  <text start="597.279" dur="5.43">is not enough because the bank needs</text>
  <text start="600.37" dur="5.25">about three hundred and sixty billion</text>
  <text start="602.709" dur="5.88">euros and the government is throwing 20</text>
  <text start="605.62" dur="6.089">billion at the problem it doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="608.589" dur="6.48">seem like it&amp;#39;s enough and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="611.709" dur="7.531">seeing is Italy most likely is going to</text>
  <text start="615.069" dur="8.75">nationalize monte dei paschi and instead</text>
  <text start="619.24" dur="7.469">of taking a small stake in the bank</text>
  <text start="623.819" dur="5.74">where they thought maybe for ten percent</text>
  <text start="626.709" dur="5.79">or so well it&amp;#39;s going to be between</text>
  <text start="629.559" dur="6.121">fifty and seventy percent of the bank</text>
  <text start="632.499" dur="6.241">now the corporate media the central</text>
  <text start="635.68" dur="4.8">banks and everyone around the country</text>
  <text start="638.74" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re looking at the stock market this</text>
  <text start="640.48" dur="3.209">is where they want everyone to look they</text>
  <text start="642.22" dur="4.44">want them to look at the stock market</text>
  <text start="643.689" dur="5.07">because to them this shows how the</text>
  <text start="646.66" dur="3.599">economy is doing and we know that this</text>
  <text start="648.759" dur="4.44">has nothing to do with the economy</text>
  <text start="650.259" dur="5.971">whatsoever and we can see that they want</text>
  <text start="653.199" dur="6.63">this to reach 20,000 points that is</text>
  <text start="656.23" dur="6.95">their goal and I want to go back in time</text>
  <text start="659.829" dur="6.11">here a little bit about 44 years ago</text>
  <text start="663.18" dur="6.73">when the Dow Jones Industrial Average</text>
  <text start="665.939" dur="7.181">closed above the 1,000 mark for the</text>
  <text start="669.91" dur="6.599">first time in history it finished around</text>
  <text start="673.12" dur="6.99">one thousand three and people were</text>
  <text start="676.509" dur="7.05">celebrating brokers were waving like</text>
  <text start="680.11" dur="7.38">fans at a football game and everything</text>
  <text start="683.559" dur="8.82">seemed fantastic Wow it finally hit a</text>
  <text start="687.49" dur="6.839">thousand points and when we look at this</text>
  <text start="692.379" dur="4.77">and we go back in time even further to</text>
  <text start="694.329" dur="5.94">1929 when the stock market hit 400</text>
  <text start="697.149" dur="5.87">points back then people were celebrating</text>
  <text start="700.269" dur="7.521">once again but you know what happened</text>
  <text start="703.019" dur="10.75">after it hit a thousand points 9 months</text>
  <text start="707.79" dur="8.26">later there u.s. entered a recession the</text>
  <text start="713.769" dur="6.541">stock market plunged over</text>
  <text start="716.05" dur="7.43">forty-four percent so it hit a high of a</text>
  <text start="720.31" dur="7.8">thousand and it was almost cut in half</text>
  <text start="723.48" dur="8.65">with a snap of a finger what are we</text>
  <text start="728.11" dur="8.27">seeing today the drive to put this up</text>
  <text start="732.13" dur="6.36">over 20,000 seems very similar to me</text>
  <text start="736.38" dur="4.269">what do you think is going to happen in</text>
  <text start="738.49" dur="5.01">the next couple of months do you really</text>
  <text start="740.649" dur="6.87">think that this is going to continually</text>
  <text start="743.5" dur="6.39">move up and up and up no what&amp;#39;s</text>
