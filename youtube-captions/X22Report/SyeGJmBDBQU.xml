  <text start="101.799" dur="5.041">and they wanted it to pass Trump was out</text>
  <text start="105.1" dur="3.93">there saying that he&amp;#39;s going to back it</text>
  <text start="106.84" dur="4.139">Paul Ryan had seven years with the</text>
  <text start="109.03" dur="5.009">Republicans to create this incredible</text>
  <text start="110.979" dur="6.331">health care bill and guess what happened</text>
  <text start="114.039" dur="5.4">they tried to push crap that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="117.31" dur="3.78">what happened but when we look at what</text>
  <text start="119.439" dur="3.511">is going on here and I know Trump was</text>
  <text start="121.09" dur="3.989">out there trying to say that this is an</text>
  <text start="122.95" dur="4.47">incredible health care but from his</text>
  <text start="125.079" dur="5.04">actions in what he&amp;#39;s doing right now it</text>
  <text start="127.42" dur="5.069">seems like he had a completely different</text>
  <text start="130.119" dur="6.601">mission now we all understand that out</text>
  <text start="132.489" dur="6.84">of the 25 or so exchanges through</text>
  <text start="136.72" dur="4.739">Obamacare more than half have closed</text>
  <text start="139.329" dur="3.511">down already we&amp;#39;ve lost billions and</text>
  <text start="141.459" dur="4.111">billions of dollars many of the states</text>
  <text start="142.84" dur="4.14">only have one choice for insurance we</text>
  <text start="145.57" dur="3.33">also understand in many of the states</text>
  <text start="146.98" dur="3.42">the premiums are rising anywhere between</text>
  <text start="148.9" dur="3.75">twenty five percent all up to a hundred</text>
  <text start="150.4" dur="5.64">and something percent and we can see</text>
  <text start="152.65" dur="5.76">that Obamacare is completely imploding</text>
  <text start="156.04" dur="3.93">on itself right now and I know that they</text>
  <text start="158.41" dur="2.85">come out with numbers saying that you</text>
  <text start="159.97" dur="2.91">know 20 million people are going to lose</text>
  <text start="161.26" dur="3.27">their insurance but you really need to</text>
  <text start="162.88" dur="3.27">break down these numbers understand</text>
  <text start="164.53" dur="3.63">where they&amp;#39;re getting the numbers from I</text>
  <text start="166.15" dur="3.78">hate when they just pull out numbers and</text>
  <text start="168.16" dur="3.359">tell you oh it&amp;#39;s 20 million people but</text>
  <text start="169.93" dur="3.389">they didn&amp;#39;t tell you that you know eight</text>
  <text start="171.519" dur="3.451">million of them were already I Medicaid</text>
  <text start="173.319" dur="3.6">they didn&amp;#39;t tell you that six million</text>
  <text start="174.97" dur="3.81">already had insurance policies and those</text>
  <text start="176.919" dur="3.451">policy got canceled and they had to move</text>
  <text start="178.78" dur="3.359">on to Obamacare it&amp;#39;s not like they</text>
  <text start="180.37" dur="2.01">didn&amp;#39;t have insurance they already had</text>
  <text start="182.139" dur="1.861">it</text>
  <text start="182.38" dur="4.05">but they had to move on to it they</text>
  <text start="184" dur="3.96">didn&amp;#39;t tell you that 7.5 million people</text>
  <text start="186.43" dur="2.79">decided that it was just too expensive</text>
  <text start="187.96" dur="3.06">and they couldn&amp;#39;t afford it so they took</text>
  <text start="189.22" dur="3.98">the penalty and said they leave that</text>
  <text start="191.02" dur="5.25">part out of it but we can see right now</text>
  <text start="193.2" dur="4.75">what is happening with Obamacare is more</text>
  <text start="196.27" dur="3.87">and more people saying i just cannot pay</text>
  <text start="197.95" dur="3.45">for this if someone was making forty or</text>
  <text start="200.14" dur="3.9">fifty thousand dollars and they have</text>
  <text start="201.4" dur="4.2">four kids or three kids or two kids and</text>
  <text start="204.04" dur="3.33">they have to spend twelve hundred</text>
  <text start="205.6" dur="3.96">fourteen hundred fifteen hundred dollars</text>
  <text start="207.37" dur="5.46">a month without getting subsidies and</text>
  <text start="209.56" dur="6">pay for the premiums they just can&amp;#39;t pay</text>
  <text start="212.83" dur="5.25">for it it&amp;#39;s too expensive so that whole</text>
  <text start="215.56" dur="5.16">Affordable Care Act thing it makes no</text>
  <text start="218.08" dur="4.14">sense and I think Trump realizes that</text>
  <text start="220.72" dur="3.54">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="222.22" dur="5.91">this thing is going to implode and we</text>
  <text start="224.26" dur="6.29">realize that Paul Ryan he&amp;#39;s had what</text>
  <text start="228.13" dur="5.3">seven years or so to think of an</text>
  <text start="230.55" dur="6.58">incredible along with the Republicans an</text>
  <text start="233.43" dur="6.04">incredible health care plan and what he</text>
  <text start="237.13" dur="5.37">put forth was complete garbage I mean it</text>
  <text start="239.47" dur="4.83">was terrible and I know Trump was out</text>
  <text start="242.5" dur="4.02">there saying yes I back it we should</text>
  <text start="244.3" dur="4.53">vote for this and I think this was part</text>
  <text start="246.52" dur="5.31">of his plan because we know that Paul</text>
  <text start="248.83" dur="5.49">Ryan he&amp;#39;s not really with Trump on</text>
  <text start="251.83" dur="4.86">anything just like McCain and all the</text>
  <text start="254.32" dur="6.27">others and I think what was happening is</text>
  <text start="256.69" dur="6.51">he wanted this failure he wanted this to</text>
  <text start="260.59" dur="4.2">happen it&amp;#39;s part of his strategy and I</text>
  <text start="263.2" dur="3.3">know people going to say well no this</text>
  <text start="264.79" dur="2.94">whole thing came around down him and</text>
  <text start="266.5" dur="3.3">it&amp;#39;s all his fault and blah blah blah</text>
  <text start="267.73" dur="3.36">blah blah but really look at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="269.8" dur="2.67">happening right now because he tweeted</text>
  <text start="271.09" dur="4.47">down he says he wanted everyone to watch</text>
  <text start="272.47" dur="4.65">judge Jeanine and her show that she puts</text>
  <text start="275.56" dur="3.75">on and Trump was going to be on there</text>
  <text start="277.12" dur="4.74">and she&amp;#39;s calling for the resignation of</text>
  <text start="279.31" dur="4.89">Paul Ryan and Trump is saying that yes</text>
  <text start="281.86" dur="3.81">you know I I back her and of course now</text>
  <text start="284.2" dur="3.39">there&amp;#39;s other reports saying the White</text>
  <text start="285.67" dur="4.2">House is saying that Trump never said</text>
  <text start="287.59" dur="4.95">this but we can see it was put out there</text>
  <text start="289.87" dur="4.47">and the way Trump works in the way he</text>
  <text start="292.54" dur="3.48">talks about things in a way he puts</text>
  <text start="294.34" dur="4.08">things out there is to get people</text>
  <text start="296.02" dur="4.65">thinking is to get people to say we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="298.42" dur="4.38">wait a minute who really did this he had</text>
  <text start="300.67" dur="5.1">seven years to put this together he put</text>
  <text start="302.8" dur="5.73">together crap he presented crap and it</text>
  <text start="305.77" dur="5.58">didn&amp;#39;t pass and it wasn&amp;#39;t for the people</text>
  <text start="308.53" dur="5.37">at all and I believe when looking at</text>
  <text start="311.35" dur="4.77">this this was a complete set up on his</text>
  <text start="313.9" dur="4.53">part now we understand that Robert David</text>
  <text start="316.12" dur="4.829">who was an ex-cia operative he talked</text>
  <text start="318.43" dur="4.29">about rinse Priebus he talked about Paul</text>
  <text start="320.949" dur="4.561">Ryan and many others are saying that</text>
  <text start="322.72" dur="4.77">they are not working for him they are</text>
  <text start="325.51" dur="3.87">working against him and we can see</text>
  <text start="327.49" dur="5.82">already that they&amp;#39;re starting to blame</text>
  <text start="329.38" dur="6.63">Priebus on this also about how this new</text>
  <text start="333.31" dur="5.88">health plan didn&amp;#39;t get through and to me</text>
  <text start="336.01" dur="6.629">this looks like it was a complete set up</text>
  <text start="339.19" dur="6.3">to try to make a maneuver to get these</text>
  <text start="342.639" dur="4.59">individuals out of office right now now</text>
  <text start="345.49" dur="3.12">does this mean that Trump is going to go</text>
  <text start="347.229" dur="3.601">back on his word he&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="348.61" dur="4.2">repeal Obamacare know what I think is</text>
  <text start="350.83" dur="4.68">happening right now he wanted to get</text>
  <text start="352.81" dur="4.68">through this terrible health care bill</text>
  <text start="355.51" dur="3.54">that was already being presented the</text>
  <text start="357.49" dur="3.36">Republicans were completely behind it</text>
  <text start="359.05" dur="3.72">they wanted it this is what they thought</text>
  <text start="360.85" dur="3.18">was great and I think what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="362.77" dur="3.39">happen now is they&amp;#39;re going to really</text>
  <text start="364.03" dur="4.199">work on something that is going to be</text>
  <text start="366.16" dur="3.15">hopefully beneficial to the people now</text>
  <text start="368.229" dur="3.301">if they put something out there that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="369.31" dur="4.139">absolutely terrible we need to call them</text>
  <text start="371.53" dur="3.24">on it this is awful this is terrible</text>
  <text start="373.449" dur="3.421">this is not going to work for the people</text>
  <text start="374.77" dur="4.53">there should be no penalties there</text>
  <text start="376.87" dur="5.01">should be no forcing of individuals on</text>
  <text start="379.3" dur="4.32">to this new plan if this plan is going</text>
  <text start="381.88" dur="3.78">to stand on its own and it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="383.62" dur="3.87">good for the people then everyone in</text>
  <text start="385.66" dur="3.66">Congress needs to take it there should</text>
  <text start="387.49" dur="5.67">be no penalties whatsoever it should be</text>
  <text start="389.32" dur="6.71">affordable and it should fit America and</text>
  <text start="393.16" dur="6.03">we&amp;#39;ll have to wait to see how this goes</text>
  <text start="396.03" dur="5.38">McCain right now he is talking about how</text>
  <text start="399.19" dur="5.61">the new world order is under enormous</text>
  <text start="401.41" dur="6.42">strain right now and he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="404.8" dur="6.179">things aren&amp;#39;t going the way the New</text>
  <text start="407.83" dur="7.17">World Order once and we need to bring</text>
  <text start="410.979" dur="6.211">everything together to continue on with</text>
  <text start="415" dur="4.82">our agenda for a one world government</text>
  <text start="417.19" dur="5.58">that&amp;#39;s pretty much what he&amp;#39;s saying and</text>
  <text start="419.82" dur="5.8">right now McCain is desperate and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="422.77" dur="5.34">urged Trump to meet with him because we</text>
  <text start="425.62" dur="3.69">can see right now McCain he&amp;#39;s in a</text>
  <text start="428.11" dur="3.989">little bit of a trouble because remember</text>
  <text start="429.31" dur="4.95">the senator revealed that he passed the</text>
  <text start="432.099" dur="4.681">fake Russian dossier claiming that Trump</text>
  <text start="434.26" dur="4.62">was into golden showers over the FBI in</text>
  <text start="436.78" dur="4.259">order to try and overturn his election</text>
  <text start="438.88" dur="4.409">when this was followed by a series of</text>
  <text start="441.039" dur="4.771">embarrassing career destroying scandals</text>
  <text start="443.289" dur="4.741">that has seen his future as a politician</text>
  <text start="445.81" dur="3.66">come under question these revelations</text>
  <text start="448.03" dur="3.21">include make</text>
  <text start="449.47" dur="4.26">closest aides being arrested for raping</text>
  <text start="451.24" dur="4.11">children became leaking national</text>
  <text start="453.73" dur="3.87">security information to Russian hackers</text>
  <text start="455.35" dur="5.91">McCain accusing Rand Paul of working</text>
  <text start="457.6" dur="6.18">directly for Vladimir Putin and we can</text>
  <text start="461.26" dur="4.86">see that McCain is in a lot of trouble</text>
  <text start="463.78" dur="5.58">right now and what is happening is these</text>
  <text start="466.12" dur="6.18">individuals who are in our government</text>
  <text start="469.36" dur="4.59">they are showing their true colors right</text>
  <text start="472.3" dur="3.72">now they&amp;#39;re showing them showing the</text>
  <text start="473.95" dur="4.77">world what they&amp;#39;re really about because</text>
  <text start="476.02" dur="6.2">they&amp;#39;re drowning here and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="478.72" dur="7.05">showing what they&amp;#39;re really all about</text>
  <text start="482.22" dur="7.24">now out in Macedonia we know that soros</text>
  <text start="485.77" dur="5.76">was pushing his agenda out there and</text>
  <text start="489.46" dur="4.05">hundreds of thousands of people in the</text>
  <text start="491.53" dur="4.23">cities across Macedonia have rejected</text>
  <text start="493.51" dur="5.28">George show us and EU and the biggest</text>
  <text start="495.76" dur="4.92">display of anti globalism ever seen for</text>
  <text start="498.79" dur="3.51">26 days straight thousands of people</text>
  <text start="500.68" dur="3.57">have taken to the streets in order to</text>
  <text start="502.3" dur="4.31">send the message to Soros and European</text>
  <text start="504.25" dur="4.65">leaders that the people of Macedonia our</text>
  <text start="506.61" dur="7.119">sovereign are a sovereign nation who</text>
  <text start="508.9" dur="7.53">utterly reject Soros the EU and we can</text>
  <text start="513.729" dur="4.381">see right now that people around the</text>
  <text start="516.43" dur="2.909">world are starting to catch on people</text>
  <text start="518.11" dur="4.83">around the world to start and realize</text>
  <text start="519.339" dur="6.301">that soros is behind a lot of what is</text>
  <text start="522.94" dur="5.1">going on here and the central bankers</text>
  <text start="525.64" dur="4.92">are behind and what is going on here now</text>
  <text start="528.04" dur="4.98">out in ukraine we understand that things</text>
  <text start="530.56" dur="6.81">are really heating up there we see this</text>
  <text start="533.02" dur="6.12">at a munitions depot well it exploded in</text>
  <text start="537.37" dur="4.469">ukraine of course poroshenko&amp;#39;s pointing</text>
  <text start="539.14" dur="5.1">the finger at russia saying that putin</text>
  <text start="541.839" dur="4.771">sabotaged it and when you look at the</text>
  <text start="544.24" dur="4.26">video it looks like there might have</text>
  <text start="546.61" dur="3.18">been some type of nuclear weapon that</text>
  <text start="548.5" dur="3.3">went off because when you look at the</text>
  <text start="549.79" dur="3.81">explosion and you look what happened you</text>
  <text start="551.8" dur="3.87">can see that it does look like some type</text>
  <text start="553.6" dur="5.61">of nuclear weapon you see a mushroom</text>
  <text start="555.67" dur="4.65">cloud you see plasma rain falling so it</text>

  <text start="560.32" dur="3.36">weapons in there who actually did this</text>
  <text start="562.48" dur="4.1">we don&amp;#39;t know but we can see that</text>
  <text start="563.68" dur="6.03">poroshenko is blaming this on Russia and</text>
  <text start="566.58" dur="6.13">we can see that he is pushing the agenda</text>
  <text start="569.71" dur="5.73">to go to war to against the</text>
  <text start="572.71" dur="4.77">south-eastern people and every time he</text>
  <text start="575.44" dur="4.32">points the finger at Russia he wants</text>

  <text start="762.579" dur="4.231">that point that the u.s. was going to be</text>
  <text start="764.829" dur="5.07">heading back into Libya because they</text>
  <text start="766.81" dur="5.76">cannot let the Libyan people take</text>
  <text start="769.899" dur="4.981">control of the oil port so these troops</text>

  <text start="852.11" dur="3.84">markings on it whatsoever well you might</text>
  <text start="854.78" dur="2.85">want to give it a little bit of space</text>
  <text start="855.95" dur="3.9">because there could be nuclear weapons</text>

  <text start="890.66" dur="4.05">things around the country does it mean</text>
  <text start="892.49" dur="4.71">anything no but we know that they do</text>
  <text start="894.71" dur="5.16">move them around on purpose for a</text>
  <text start="897.2" dur="5.16">specific reason we understand that the</text>
  <text start="899.87" dur="4.83">elite and the ultra-wealthy well they</text>

  <text start="924.02" dur="5.01">there are riots or anything like that</text>
