  <text start="314.44" dur="7.349">central bank system is coming to an end</text>
  <text start="316.199" dur="8.381">everything needs to change now what we</text>
  <text start="321.789" dur="5.761">have noticed is that more countries are</text>
  <text start="324.58" dur="4.649">moving away from the dollar now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="327.55" dur="4.56">said this before Trump even came into</text>
  <text start="329.229" dur="5.19">office and we knew that this was part of</text>
  <text start="332.11" dur="4.649">the central bank plan they were going to</text>
  <text start="334.419" dur="4.051">move everything someplace else the</text>
  <text start="336.759" dur="3.771">United States was no longer going to be</text>
  <text start="338.47" dur="4.8">the reserve currency of the world</text>
  <text start="340.53" dur="5.259">Russia is selling its oil outside the</text>
  <text start="343.27" dur="5.22">dollar China Iran Venezuela and the</text>
  <text start="345.789" dur="5.641">Middle Eastern countries they are now</text>
  <text start="348.49" dur="5.28">selling outside of the dollar Saudi</text>
  <text start="351.43" dur="4.019">Arabia made a deal with Russia and guess</text>
  <text start="353.77" dur="6.299">what they&amp;#39;re not using the dollar in</text>
  <text start="355.449" dur="5.641">that trade Trump is ending the endless</text>
  <text start="360.069" dur="4.261">wars in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="361.09" dur="6.21">remember this was set up for the petro</text>
  <text start="364.33" dur="5.28">dollar if we go back to 1971 we had</text>
  <text start="367.3" dur="4.38">Henry Kissinger he was making the deals</text>
  <text start="369.61" dur="5.04">throughout the 60s with the Middle East</text>
  <text start="371.68" dur="6.959">and said to them listen we will use our</text>
  <text start="374.65" dur="7.859">military to protect you as long as you</text>
  <text start="378.639" dur="8.601">sell the oil using the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="382.509" dur="8.4">Note which we call the petro dollar and</text>
  <text start="387.24" dur="6.97">these countries kept the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="390.909" dur="6.391">note in their reserves they use this to</text>
  <text start="394.21" dur="6.03">buy goods from the United States this is</text>
  <text start="397.3" dur="4.799">why we didn&amp;#39;t need fair trade deals</text>
  <text start="400.24" dur="4.26">because they were using their reserves</text>
  <text start="402.099" dur="4.62">to buy our goods this is when we had</text>
  <text start="404.5" dur="5.099">quite a bit of manufacturing here in the</text>
  <text start="406.719" dur="5.461">United States but everything changed of</text>
  <text start="409.599" dur="4.831">course now think about this and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="412.18" dur="6.299">said this back during the period of</text>
  <text start="414.43" dur="6.9">Obama we knew eventually countries were</text>
  <text start="418.479" dur="5.31">going to move away from the Federal</text>
  <text start="421.33" dur="4.889">Reserve Note and those notes that were</text>
  <text start="423.789" dur="4.321">held in reserve they were going to flow</text>
  <text start="426.219" dur="4.801">back to the United States and</text>
  <text start="428.11" dur="4.17">would see inflation like we&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="431.02" dur="5.7">seen inflation it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="432.28" dur="7.92">hyperinflation now the Patriots they</text>
  <text start="436.72" dur="6.15">know this the Patriots decided to do</text>
  <text start="440.2" dur="7.49">something very very interesting and it</text>
  <text start="442.87" dur="7.2">is happening right now Trump mentioned</text>
  <text start="447.69" dur="6.1">that the United States is becoming</text>
  <text start="450.07" dur="9.15">energy independent we are producing</text>
  <text start="453.79" dur="8.4">shale oil we are selling this oil to</text>
  <text start="459.22" dur="5.13">other areas around the world and those</text>
  <text start="462.19" dur="6.18">countries that want to buy this oil have</text>
  <text start="464.35" dur="7.05">to have US dollars now the shale oil</text>
  <text start="468.37" dur="5.22">industry well it doesn&amp;#39;t really make a</text>
  <text start="471.4" dur="4.83">profit right now it did when the oil</text>
  <text start="473.59" dur="7.95">prices were much higher but as they came</text>
  <text start="476.23" dur="10.59">down it kind of clobbered them so the</text>
  <text start="481.54" dur="6.32">government is subsidizing the shale oil</text>
  <text start="486.82" dur="4.26">business</text>
  <text start="487.86" dur="6.67">now all these dollars because we know</text>
  <text start="491.08" dur="6.33">around the world that countries are</text>
  <text start="494.53" dur="4.86">moving away from the dollar the dollars</text>
  <text start="497.41" dur="4.8">have to go someplace they just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="499.39" dur="5.45">disappear into thin air those dollars</text>
  <text start="502.21" dur="6.87">are coming back to the United States and</text>
  <text start="504.84" dur="6.76">they&amp;#39;re using this to subsidize the oil</text>
  <text start="509.08" dur="5.25">industry and they&amp;#39;re telling other</text>
  <text start="511.6" dur="6.39">countries to use their dollars to</text>
  <text start="514.33" dur="7.649">purchase this oil they can&amp;#39;t allow the</text>
  <text start="517.99" dur="6.93">dollar to hit Main Street if the dollar</text>
  <text start="521.979" dur="6.961">hits Main Street we will see</text>
  <text start="524.92" dur="8.04">hyperinflation now think about what is</text>
  <text start="528.94" dur="9.21">happening here we are moving away from</text>
  <text start="532.96" dur="8.28">the Middle Eastern oil we are moving</text>
  <text start="538.15" dur="5.84">away from the petro dollar system and</text>
  <text start="541.24" dur="6.54">when you start to put all this together</text>
  <text start="543.99" dur="6.07">you get new trade deals we&amp;#39;re not paying</text>
  <text start="547.78" dur="4.86">for NATO we&amp;#39;re not going to be the sole</text>
  <text start="550.06" dur="5.639">supplier of NATO we&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="552.64" dur="5.879">the sole supplier of the UN</text>
  <text start="555.699" dur="5.07">and we need to produce energy we also</text>
  <text start="558.519" dur="3.12">need companies manufacturers coming back</text>
  <text start="560.769" dur="2.97">to the United States</text>
  <text start="561.639" dur="3.93">we need to deregulate which I believe</text>
  <text start="563.739" dur="4.801">we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot more deregulation</text>
  <text start="565.569" dur="5.43">coming up very very soon and we need to</text>
  <text start="568.54" dur="5.909">cut taxes to allow the people to have</text>
  <text start="570.999" dur="7.38">more and more spending currency to keep</text>
  <text start="574.449" dur="9">the economy alive all of this is being</text>
  <text start="578.379" dur="8.221">prepped for the transition that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="583.449" dur="7.17">we see happening right now actually we</text>
  <text start="586.6" dur="7.5">are in the middle of the pre transition</text>
  <text start="590.619" dur="7.77">into the new economy it is being set up</text>
  <text start="594.1" dur="6.719">right now and there&amp;#39;s going to be more</text>
  <text start="598.389" dur="5.401">and more countries that will move away</text>
  <text start="600.819" dur="4.2">from the Federal Reserve Note now this</text>
  <text start="603.79" dur="3.899">doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re moving away from</text>

  <text start="615.97" dur="5.969">backed by gold q has told us that gold</text>
  <text start="619.269" dur="7.56">is going to destroy the Fed yesterday we</text>
  <text start="621.939" dur="8.61">reported that Trump his team tweeted out</text>
  <text start="626.829" dur="6.93">the gold standard letting us know that</text>
  <text start="630.549" dur="5.97">this is where we are headed and we also</text>

  <text start="636.519" dur="6.211">removed from Fort Knox that has been</text>
  <text start="639.309" dur="5.7">recovered but we see that there are more</text>
  <text start="642.73" dur="4.699">and more countries that are making deals</text>
  <text start="645.009" dur="6.841">outside of the central bank note why</text>
  <text start="647.429" dur="7.57">because they understand that this system</text>
  <text start="651.85" dur="5.719">is about to implode they know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="654.999" dur="4.68">going on they might not tell the people</text>
  <text start="657.569" dur="4.151">because think about it if you went out</text>
  <text start="659.679" dur="4.53">and you told the people listen you know</text>
  <text start="661.72" dur="4.5">the system we&amp;#39;re in right now well this</text>
