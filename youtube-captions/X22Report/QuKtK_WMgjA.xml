  <text start="43.379" dur="6.691">players together for World War 3 let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="47.01" dur="5.85">get into the economic collapse political</text>
  <text start="50.07" dur="5.339">and geopolitical news now the US</text>
  <text start="52.86" dur="5.159">government is continually trying to chip</text>
  <text start="55.409" dur="5.011">away at our rights of course through</text>
  <text start="58.019" dur="5.491">common core they&amp;#39;re telling the children</text>
  <text start="60.42" dur="4.769">that the rights are actually privileges</text>
  <text start="63.51" dur="4.44">and the government can take them away</text>
  <text start="65.189" dur="4.771">they&amp;#39;re rewriting a lot of the Bill of</text>
  <text start="67.95" dur="3.48">Rights of course they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="69.96" dur="3.479">make it simpler for the P for the</text>
  <text start="71.43" dur="4.079">children to understand but what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="73.439" dur="3.511">really doing is changing it so they</text>
  <text start="75.509" dur="4.411">don&amp;#39;t understand what the real</text>
  <text start="76.95" dur="8.51">definition of the rights are and we see</text>
  <text start="79.92" dur="7.949">that the government is moving quickly to</text>
  <text start="85.46" dur="3.97">chip away at the First Amendment the</text>
  <text start="87.869" dur="6.151">Second Amendment the Fourth Amendment</text>
  <text start="89.43" dur="8.55">and the rest of our rights and we see</text>
  <text start="94.02" dur="8.37">that the house of Democrats and the</text>
  <text start="97.98" dur="7.74">Attorney General are looking to censor</text>
  <text start="102.39" dur="4.8">free speech and of course the First</text>
  <text start="105.72" dur="4.83">Amendment allows us for free speech now</text>
  <text start="107.19" dur="5.37">remember the First Amendment doesn&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="110.55" dur="5.31">you know anything about hate speech it</text>
  <text start="112.56" dur="6.599">doesn&amp;#39;t say anything about what speech</text>
  <text start="115.86" dur="5.97">is allowed because it&amp;#39;s free you can say</text>
  <text start="119.159" dur="5.101">whatever you want if somebody doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="121.83" dur="6.239">like it they don&amp;#39;t have to listen but</text>
  <text start="124.26" dur="5.91">its your right to speak freely when the</text>
  <text start="128.069" dur="5.071">government steps in and creates</text>
  <text start="130.17" dur="5.789">legislation that says well you can&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="133.14" dur="6.75">these words you can&amp;#39;t say that to that</text>
  <text start="135.959" dur="6.961">group we forbid you from saying that</text>
  <text start="139.89" dur="6.39">over there and if you do say these</text>
  <text start="142.92" dur="5.7">things it&amp;#39;s a crime that&amp;#39;s no longer</text>
  <text start="146.28" dur="6.019">free speech that&amp;#39;s controlled or</text>
  <text start="148.62" dur="6.42">permitted speech and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="152.299" dur="5.5">what our government is trying to do now</text>
  <text start="155.04" dur="6.779">I are not on the side of Republican</text>
  <text start="157.799" dur="6.77">Democrat or any other group the side I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="161.819" dur="6.5">on is the everyday person</text>
  <text start="164.569" dur="7.23">who lives here in the US who supports</text>
  <text start="168.319" dur="4.801">the Constitution who believes the</text>
  <text start="171.799" dur="5.64">government should be working for the</text>
  <text start="173.12" dur="9.39">people period the end that&amp;#39;s it but our</text>
  <text start="177.439" dur="8.211">government seems they have the right to</text>
  <text start="182.51" dur="5.399">tell us what we can and cannot say and</text>
  <text start="185.65" dur="8.259">they&amp;#39;re trying to pass original</text>
  <text start="187.909" dur="10.431">resolution H resolution 569 condemning</text>
  <text start="193.909" dur="8.461">violence bigotry and hateful rhetoric</text>
  <text start="198.34" dur="6.399">towards Muslims in the United States now</text>
  <text start="202.37" dur="9.72">if you commit a violent crime that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="204.739" dur="10.95">crime I agree but hateful speech or</text>
  <text start="212.09" dur="5.849">anything like that is trying to control</text>
  <text start="215.689" dur="5.61">people and what they can and cannot say</text>
  <text start="217.939" dur="7.44">and that is an infringement on the First</text>
  <text start="221.299" dur="5.61">Amendment the resolution goes on to the</text>
  <text start="225.379" dur="4.11">announced in the strongest terms the</text>
  <text start="226.909" dur="4.08">increase of hate speech and this is what</text>
  <text start="229.489" dur="4.291">they&amp;#39;re trying to use to convince</text>
  <text start="230.989" dur="6.541">everyone they have the right to control</text>
  <text start="233.78" dur="6.449">or permit certain speech and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="237.53" dur="6.09">saying what hey speech is is</text>
  <text start="240.229" dur="5.82">intimidation violence vandalism arson</text>
  <text start="243.62" dur="5.699">and other hate crimes target against</text>
  <text start="246.049" dur="6.481">mosques Muslims or those perceived to be</text>
  <text start="249.319" dur="5.491">Muslims so they&amp;#39;re using this in the</text>
  <text start="252.53" dur="5.579">beginning to try to control what people</text>
  <text start="254.81" dur="5.429">are saying now do we really need another</text>
  <text start="258.109" dur="5.221">law that&amp;#39;s saying anyone that commits</text>
  <text start="260.239" dur="5.911">violence vandalism arson against another</text>
  <text start="263.33" dur="5.459">group of people is a crime no we already</text>
  <text start="266.15" dur="4.769">have those laws why do we have to</text>
  <text start="268.789" dur="3.72">continually rewrite them it makes no</text>
  <text start="270.919" dur="5.131">sense the reason why they&amp;#39;re rewriting</text>
  <text start="272.509" dur="6.121">them is to stick in the hate speech part</text>
  <text start="276.05" dur="7.859">the part where they want to control</text>
  <text start="278.63" dur="6.779">speech and what you say so the part of</text>
  <text start="283.909" dur="4.621">the house resolution that should most</text>
  <text start="285.409" dur="4.82">concern all Americans is the urging of</text>
  <text start="288.53" dur="4.109">local and federal law enforcement</text>
  <text start="290.229" dur="5.771">authorities to work to prevent hate</text>
  <text start="292.639" dur="6.061">crimes and to prosecute to the fullest</text>
  <text start="296" dur="6.05">extent of the law those perpetrators</text>
  <text start="298.7" dur="6.66">of hate crimes so what is a hate crime</text>
  <text start="302.05" dur="5.74">the law already prohibits violence</text>
  <text start="305.36" dur="5.04">threats of violence and law enforcement</text>
  <text start="307.79" dur="6.48">authorities already know what to do in</text>
  <text start="310.4" dur="7.41">that case imitate intimidation</text>
  <text start="314.27" dur="5.36">destruction damage vandalism oh we</text>
  <text start="317.81" dur="7.76">already have laws on the book for that</text>
  <text start="319.63" dur="9.61">however bigotry and hateful rhetoric in</text>
  <text start="325.57" dur="6.64">its title Americans should be worried</text>
  <text start="329.24" dur="4.59">about this so what the government is</text>
  <text start="332.21" dur="5.94">doing is they&amp;#39;re creating this</text>
  <text start="333.83" dur="7.14">legislation to coincide with UNHRC</text>
  <text start="338.15" dur="6.57">resolution 1618 which was passed in</text>
  <text start="340.97" dur="5.91">March of 2011 without a vote resolution</text>
  <text start="344.72" dur="4.41">1618 seeks to limit speech that is</text>
  <text start="346.88" dur="4.76">viewed as discriminatory or which</text>
  <text start="349.13" dur="5.12">involves the defamation of a religion</text>
  <text start="351.64" dur="5.86">specifically that which can be viewed as</text>
  <text start="354.25" dur="4.75">incitement to imminent violence this</text>
  <text start="357.5" dur="3.33">latest version which includes the</text>
  <text start="359" dur="4.47">incitement to imminent violence phrase</text>
  <text start="360.83" dur="4.65">that is which criminalizes speech which</text>
  <text start="363.47" dur="4.02">incites violence against others on the</text>
  <text start="365.48" dur="4.59">basis of religion race or national</text>
  <text start="367.49" dur="4.95">origin origin has succeeded in winning</text>
  <text start="370.07" dur="6.39">us approval despite the fact that it</text>
  <text start="372.44" dur="10.35">indirectly places limitations on speech</text>
  <text start="376.46" dur="10.41">and basically what they&amp;#39;re saying right</text>
  <text start="382.79" dur="5.7">now is they will tell you through these</text>
  <text start="386.87" dur="7.29">laws and this is always the first step</text>
  <text start="388.49" dur="14.57">what you can and cannot say and through</text>
  <text start="394.16" dur="15.78">this legislation 569 they can basically</text>
  <text start="403.06" dur="10.65">hit you with a crime if your speech is</text>
  <text start="409.94" dur="7.13">considered hateful if your speech</text>
  <text start="413.71" dur="5.56">doesn&amp;#39;t agree with the government&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="417.07" dur="7.63">narrative of what free speech should be</text>
  <text start="419.27" dur="7.83">and they can press charges but the</text>
  <text start="424.7" dur="4.77">question is who decides to see this is</text>
  <text start="427.1" dur="3.36">the problem with all this because</text>
  <text start="429.47" dur="2.73">everyone comes from a different</text>
  <text start="430.46" dur="4.92">background ever</text>
  <text start="432.2" dur="5.52">has a different religion everyone has</text>
  <text start="435.38" dur="4.44">different viewpoints everyone has</text>
  <text start="437.72" dur="6.08">different views on what is free speech</text>
  <text start="439.82" dur="8.73">and what is controlled speech and the</text>
  <text start="443.8" dur="7.24">Constitution says all speech is</text>
  <text start="448.55" dur="4.32">completely free there&amp;#39;s nothing in there</text>
  <text start="451.04" dur="3.39">that says you can say this or you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="452.87" dur="5.1">say that that&amp;#39;s why they put that in</text>
  <text start="454.43" dur="7.35">there where they said the people have</text>
  <text start="457.97" dur="7.14">the right to free speech and everyone</text>
  <text start="461.78" dur="5.73">has to realize that once you start</text>
  <text start="465.11" dur="4.62">controlling the speech just like</text>
  <text start="467.51" dur="3.45">political correctness because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="469.73" dur="3.09">really what it is they&amp;#39;re controlling</text>
  <text start="470.96" dur="3.06">and giving you permitted speech because</text>
  <text start="472.82" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re telling you which words you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="474.02" dur="5.73">allowed to use and which words your you</text>
  <text start="476.15" dur="8.25">aren&amp;#39;t allowed to use and what they do</text>
  <text start="479.75" dur="6.72">is they slowly create these laws saying</text>
  <text start="484.4" dur="4.8">now it&amp;#39;s a crime to say that it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="486.47" dur="4.65">crime to say this and they expand it</text>
  <text start="489.2" dur="5.28">they expand it and this is what is</text>
  <text start="491.12" dur="7.08">happening right now because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="494.48" dur="6.06">pushing their agenda their agenda is to</text>
  <text start="498.2" dur="8.19">get rid of the Bill of Rights it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="500.54" dur="8.31">thorn in their side now yesterday Obama</text>
  <text start="506.39" dur="5.07">came out with his gun control laws and</text>
  <text start="508.85" dur="6.54">they started throwing around statistics</text>
  <text start="511.46" dur="6.84">and a journalist Emily Miller went on</text>
  <text start="515.39" dur="5.339">Twitter to say we&amp;#39;ll wait a minute Obama</text>
  <text start="518.3" dur="4.41">came out with Josh earnest and they</text>
  <text start="520.729" dur="4.831">delivered some statistics saying that</text>
  <text start="522.71" dur="9.09">there are 30,000 gun deaths in america</text>
  <text start="525.56" dur="7.65">and we need to stop this well Emily went</text>
  <text start="531.8" dur="4.71">a little bit further to look at these</text>
  <text start="533.21" dur="5.82">statistics and she found that well</text>
  <text start="536.51" dur="5.04">twenty thousand of those were from</text>
  <text start="539.03" dur="4.62">suicides so if the people didn&amp;#39;t commit</text>
  <text start="541.55" dur="3.69">suicide by a gun they would have chose</text>
  <text start="543.65" dur="3.75">poison they would have hung themselves</text>
  <text start="545.24" dur="4.14">thrown themselves out of a building so</text>
  <text start="547.4" dur="5.25">can you really count those and then when</text>
  <text start="549.38" dur="8.01">you look closely at this and you</text>
  <text start="552.65" dur="8.34">subtract the 20 1175 you get eight</text>
  <text start="557.39" dur="8.64">thousand from homicides and the FBI</text>
  <text start="560.99" dur="7.71">actually says yes it&amp;#39;s 8124</text>
  <text start="566.03" dur="4.65">so the administration is just throwing</text>
  <text start="568.7" dur="5.55">around statistics and if you don&amp;#39;t look</text>
  <text start="570.68" dur="7.62">closely at the statistics they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="574.25" dur="6.78">misleading now DHS is pushing the Real</text>
  <text start="578.3" dur="4.68">ID they want all states to come on board</text>
  <text start="581.03" dur="4.62">and they&amp;#39;ve given other states like</text>
  <text start="582.98" dur="6.51">California another 10 months to come in</text>
  <text start="585.65" dur="6.81">line with their real ID act and DHS is</text>
  <text start="589.49" dur="4.68">out there and they&amp;#39;re saying that no</text>
  <text start="592.46" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;re not setting up a central database</text>
  <text start="594.17" dur="5.49">of everyone&amp;#39;s information that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="596.57" dur="5.07">completely fake phony and falls not what</text>
  <text start="599.66" dur="4.71">we&amp;#39;re now that&amp;#39;s a rumor what we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="601.64" dur="6.02">doing that and it&amp;#39;s funny because when</text>
  <text start="604.37" dur="8.28">you look at the text of the Real ID Act</text>
  <text start="607.66" dur="7.66">title to section 202 d12 there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="612.65" dur="6.72">section in there that says provide</text>
  <text start="615.32" dur="6.27">electronic access to all other states to</text>
  <text start="619.37" dur="6.89">information contained in the motor</text>
  <text start="621.59" dur="7.7">vehicle database of the state which says</text>
  <text start="626.26" dur="5.89">they are collecting all that information</text>
  <text start="629.29" dur="6.61">to be brought into a centralized</text>
  <text start="632.15" dur="9.27">database and this information will then</text>
  <text start="635.9" dur="10.95">be shared with all the agencies so what</text>
  <text start="641.42" dur="10.46">they&amp;#39;re really saying is fake phony and</text>
  <text start="646.85" dur="8.76">false it is a lie they are creating a</text>
  <text start="651.88" dur="7.18">centralized database system now out in</text>
  <text start="655.61" dur="6.21">Oregon we see the situation is heating</text>
  <text start="659.06" dur="6.45">up we know the FBI is there and oath</text>
  <text start="661.82" dur="7.71">keepers put out kind of a statement here</text>
  <text start="665.51" dur="5.97">and they have received credible</text>
  <text start="669.53" dur="4.26">information from an active duty source</text>
  <text start="671.48" dur="5.31">within the Special Operations community</text>
  <text start="673.79" dur="5.73">that at least one reserved National</text>
  <text start="676.79" dur="4.08">Guard Special Operations attachment unit</text>
  <text start="679.52" dur="3.93">under the command of Joint Special</text>
  <text start="680.87" dur="6.05">Operations Command has been tasked for</text>
  <text start="683.45" dur="7.56">the standoff at the wildlife reserve and</text>
  <text start="686.92" dur="6.58">they moved into the area and I&amp;#39;ve always</text>
  <text start="691.01" dur="6.21">said that we need to be very worried</text>
  <text start="693.5" dur="4.83">about agent provocateurs and it looks</text>
  <text start="697.22" dur="2.25">like they&amp;#39;re going to be cutting off the</text>
  <text start="698.33" dur="3.6">power to</text>
  <text start="699.47" dur="5.1">the wildlife reserve to try to force the</text>
  <text start="701.93" dur="7.02">people out of this area but it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="704.57" dur="7.83">interesting is from oath keepers Stewart</text>
  <text start="708.95" dur="6.33">roads he said the following that oath</text>
  <text start="712.4" dur="4.95">keepers opposes the armed occupation of</text>
  <text start="715.28" dur="6.3">the wildlife refuge for the reasons</text>
  <text start="717.35" dur="6.06">already stated last Friday and he went</text>
  <text start="721.58" dur="5.31">on to say that we cannot force ourselves</text>
  <text start="723.41" dur="6.15">or our protection on people who do not</text>
  <text start="726.89" dur="4.2">want it Dwight and Steven Hammond have</text>
  <text start="729.56" dur="3.24">made it clear through their attorney</text>
  <text start="731.09" dur="4.32">that they just want to turn themselves</text>
  <text start="732.8" dur="4.23">in and serve out their sentence and that</text>
  <text start="735.41" dur="4.02">clear statement of their intent should</text>
  <text start="737.03" dur="4.14">be the end of the discussion on this no</text>
  <text start="739.43" dur="3.48">Patriot group or individual has the</text>
  <text start="741.17" dur="4.83">right or authority to force an armed</text>
  <text start="742.91" dur="5.79">standoff on this family or around them</text>
  <text start="746" dur="5.06">against their wishes you cannot help</text>
  <text start="748.7" dur="4.98">someone who does not want your help and</text>
  <text start="751.06" dur="6.4">who are not willing and ready to take a</text>
  <text start="753.68" dur="10.37">hard stand themselves but we can see em</text>
  <text start="757.46" dur="11.13">in money and Ryan pain basically are</text>
  <text start="764.05" dur="9.22">making a stand I heard the press</text>
  <text start="768.59" dur="9.6">conference with Ammon Bundy and we can</text>
  <text start="773.27" dur="8.66">see that they are very upset that the</text>
  <text start="778.19" dur="8.45">BLM has been stealing the land around</text>
  <text start="781.93" dur="8.38">Oregon Nevada and many other states and</text>
  <text start="786.64" dur="5.32">when we look at the big picture we see</text>
  <text start="790.31" dur="4.61">that the federal government has come in</text>
  <text start="791.96" dur="7.38">and has taken most of the land and</text>
  <text start="794.92" dur="7.87">basically under the Enclave Act federal</text>
  <text start="799.34" dur="6.21">government cannot own land they can only</text>
  <text start="802.79" dur="6.39">own the land under federal buildings</text>
  <text start="805.55" dur="6.81">armories and as such but it seems that</text>
  <text start="809.18" dur="6.3">they are gobbling up as much land as</text>
  <text start="812.36" dur="7.71">possible and most likely they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="815.48" dur="6.24">this as collateral for the debt and this</text>
  <text start="820.07" dur="3.3">is why they need more and more of this</text>
  <text start="821.72" dur="5.22">land but the federal government does not</text>
  <text start="823.37" dur="8.4">own this land and we can see at this</text>
  <text start="826.94" dur="6.45">point that this is a set up which is</text>
  <text start="831.77" dur="4.19">perfect for Obama</text>
  <text start="833.39" dur="7.89">to use this situation to demonize</text>
  <text start="835.96" dur="9.61">Patriots constitutionalists and it seems</text>
  <text start="841.28" dur="8.31">like they would like this whole entire</text>
  <text start="845.57" dur="6.14">scenario to go south very quickly but</text>
  <text start="849.59" dur="7.05">they need to make it look like the</text>
  <text start="851.71" dur="10.63">people in the Wildlife Refuge started it</text>
  <text start="856.64" dur="7.47">and Stewart Rhodes is saying that he has</text>
  <text start="862.34" dur="3.57">a warning to the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="864.11" dur="5.67">that there this is not going to be</text>
  <text start="865.91" dur="6.63">another Waco he says we oppose that what</text>
  <text start="869.78" dur="4.35">ammon bundy and ryan pain have done we</text>
  <text start="872.54" dur="4.74">must warn the obama administration that</text>
  <text start="874.13" dur="5.55">it does not have free rein to waco the</text>
  <text start="877.28" dur="6.12">people in the standoff by using deadly</text>
  <text start="879.68" dur="7.38">military force such as the force that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="883.4" dur="5.13">coming in right now or the FBI he says</text>
  <text start="887.06" dur="4.59">the federal government must respect</text>
  <text start="888.53" dur="4.71">their right to due process and the do</text>
  <text start="891.65" dur="5.25">all it can to end this standoff</text>
  <text start="893.24" dur="6.09">peacefully without loss of life and it</text>
  <text start="896.9" dur="4.38">must treat it like the Freeman standoff</text>
  <text start="899.33" dur="3.54">not the wake of standoff and I agree</text>
  <text start="901.28" dur="4.47">with him completely there&amp;#39;s no reason to</text>
  <text start="902.87" dur="4.92">go in there with guns blazing but as we</text>
  <text start="905.75" dur="4.74">know the government the way they do</text>
  <text start="907.79" dur="5.49">things they want a standoff they want a</text>
  <text start="910.49" dur="5.31">big shootout they want to demonize the</text>
  <text start="913.28" dur="4.74">Patriots the people who are standing up</text>
  <text start="915.8" dur="5.28">for the Constitution the rights of the</text>
  <text start="918.02" dur="4.2">people and they don&amp;#39;t want these people</text>
  <text start="921.08" dur="3.42">showing that the federal government</text>
  <text start="922.22" dur="4.5">doesn&amp;#39;t have authorization to take the</text>
  <text start="924.5" dur="4.86">land from the people because nowhere in</text>
  <text start="926.72" dur="4.74">the Constitution does it say the federal</text>
  <text start="929.36" dur="6.48">government has the right to take the</text>
  <text start="931.46" dur="7.14">land so we&amp;#39;re gonna have to watch this</text>
  <text start="935.84" dur="6.27">very carefully to see what is going to</text>
  <text start="938.6" dur="8.37">occur what&amp;#39;s going to happen because as</text>
  <text start="942.11" dur="7.11">things go on we need to look at who is</text>
  <text start="946.97" dur="4.59">the agent provocateur what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="949.22" dur="5.76">trying to accomplish and how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="951.56" dur="5.67">going to make this scenario evolve into</text>
  <text start="954.98" dur="5.25">a big shootout and this is what we need</text>
  <text start="957.23" dur="4.86">to look for now out North Korea it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="960.23" dur="4.26">been all over the corporate media and</text>
  <text start="962.09" dur="4.13">they&amp;#39;re really blowing this out of</text>
  <text start="964.49" dur="4.22">proportion</text>
  <text start="966.22" dur="8.61">and basically they&amp;#39;re saying that North</text>
  <text start="968.71" dur="8.55">Korea basically set off a hydrogen bomb</text>
  <text start="974.83" dur="7.76">underground which caused a man-made</text>
  <text start="977.26" dur="9.54">earthquake but the problem is is that</text>
  <text start="982.59" dur="7.74">the estimated explosive yield from North</text>
  <text start="986.8" dur="6.6">Korea&amp;#39;s nuclear explosion was smaller</text>
  <text start="990.33" dur="5.26">then what even a failed H bomb</text>
  <text start="993.4" dur="4.92">detonation would produce so at this</text>
  <text start="995.59" dur="6.51">point we really don&amp;#39;t have the evidence</text>
  <text start="998.32" dur="6.09">that they actually detonated an h-bomb</text>
  <text start="1002.1" dur="5.16">now of course nATO Secretary General</text>
  <text start="1004.41" dur="5.28">Jens Stoltenberg says the nuclear</text>
  <text start="1007.26" dur="4.59">weapons test and announced by North</text>
  <text start="1009.69" dur="4.59">Korea is a clear breach of UN Security</text>
  <text start="1011.85" dur="4.29">Council resolution and undermines</text>
  <text start="1014.28" dur="2.64">regional and international security now</text>
  <text start="1016.14" dur="3.33">of course there&amp;#39;s no proof whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1016.92" dur="4.41">they haven&amp;#39;t shown any proof everyone is</text>
  <text start="1019.47" dur="4.62">just screaming and yelling that this is</text>
  <text start="1021.33" dur="4.77">a breach Russia said we&amp;#39;ll wait a minute</text>
  <text start="1024.09" dur="4.83">hold on everyone it hasn&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="1026.1" dur="5.34">confirmed that North Korea has carried</text>
  <text start="1028.92" dur="3.84">out in actual nuclear tests now I know</text>
  <text start="1031.44" dur="2.79">they&amp;#39;re out there saying that yes</text>
  <text start="1032.76" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re admitting that they did this</text>
  <text start="1034.23" dur="5.04">test but again we have to look at the</text>
  <text start="1036.24" dur="5.43">propaganda aspect of this now the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1039.27" dur="4.38">is out there saying well all the</text>
  <text start="1041.67" dur="4.58">information doesn&amp;#39;t point to an h-bomb</text>
  <text start="1043.65" dur="6.3">but it there was some type of nuclear</text>
  <text start="1046.25" dur="6.27">explosion or something and we can see</text>
  <text start="1049.95" dur="5.7">why this is taking place at this time</text>
  <text start="1052.52" dur="4.54">they&amp;#39;re using this propaganda to bring</text>
  <text start="1055.65" dur="2.58">all the players together and we have to</text>
  <text start="1057.06" dur="3.51">remember the players are always the same</text>
  <text start="1058.23" dur="4.76">it&amp;#39;s going to be Iran Syria North Korea</text>
  <text start="1060.57" dur="5.58">China Russia and the other BRIC nations</text>
  <text start="1062.99" dur="5.29">for this great war and this is what</text>
  <text start="1066.15" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re doing at this point South Korea</text>
  <text start="1068.28" dur="3.57">is already out there saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1069.93" dur="3.99">going to increase its monitoring of</text>
  <text start="1071.85" dur="5.7">North Korea they&amp;#39;re going to increase</text>
  <text start="1073.92" dur="7.8">their military budgets that they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="1077.55" dur="5.91">angry with the North Koreans and the UN</text>
  <text start="1081.72" dur="3.93">Security Council condemned North Korea&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1083.46" dur="4.47">nuclear test but of course no one has</text>
  <text start="1085.65" dur="4.53">given any proof that it was a nuclear</text>
  <text start="1087.93" dur="3.93">test whatsoever everyone is just</text>
  <text start="1090.18" dur="4.32">screaming and yelling and saying this is</text>
  <text start="1091.86" dur="4.14">what it was and already the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="1094.5" dur="2.97">saying well because of this because of</text>
  <text start="1096" dur="2.76">this nuclear explosion we don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="1097.47" dur="2.16">it&amp;#39;s an h-bomb or whatever it is but it</text>
  <text start="1098.76" dur="3.54">doesn&amp;#39;t really matter</text>
  <text start="1099.63" dur="6.11">we&amp;#39;re going to impose more sanctions on</text>
  <text start="1102.3" dur="5.94">North Korea this is what it&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="1105.74" dur="4.3">this is what all this propaganda is</text>
  <text start="1108.24" dur="4.74">about just like the cyber attacks on</text>
  <text start="1110.04" dur="4.53">Sony boom they knew exactly it was North</text>
  <text start="1112.98" dur="5.31">Korea and they had a place sanctions</text>
  <text start="1114.57" dur="5.88">they need to bring in the players into</text>
  <text start="1118.29" dur="5.07">the fold because at this point the</text>
  <text start="1120.45" dur="5.31">economy is collapsing the entire system</text>
  <text start="1123.36" dur="5.22">is imploding and they need the players</text>
  <text start="1125.76" dur="7.17">ready to go they need to provoke each</text>
  <text start="1128.58" dur="6.39">one of these countries now I say let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1132.93" dur="4.29">wait for the proof I mean they&amp;#39;ve had an</text>
  <text start="1134.97" dur="4.53">earthquake and right now they jump to</text>
  <text start="1137.22" dur="3.75">yes this there was an h-bomb then it</text>
  <text start="1139.5" dur="2.94">wasn&amp;#39;t an h-bomb then it was some type</text>
  <text start="1140.97" dur="3.39">of nuclear explosion but we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1142.44" dur="5.18">really sure and they continually go on</text>
  <text start="1144.36" dur="7.25">and on and on about this now out in</text>

  <text start="1323.41" dur="5.74">everything is starting to move down this</text>

  <text start="1359.51" dur="6.769">talks with Russia and Syria might not go</text>

  <text start="1395.739" dur="5.07">Iran it has to do with Saudi Arabia it</text>
  <text start="1398.769" dur="4.89">has to do with coalition forces and this</text>
  <text start="1400.809" dur="7.47">next plan can&amp;#39;t be small I mean they</text>
