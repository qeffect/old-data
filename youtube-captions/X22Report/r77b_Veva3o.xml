  <text start="62.01" dur="5.37">June 26th 2017 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="65.04" dur="5.85">episode is the plan the plot and how the</text>
  <text start="67.38" dur="5.79">deep state is being outmaneuvered let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="70.89" dur="5.16">get into the economic collapse political</text>
  <text start="73.17" dur="6.3">and geopolitical news now Trump has been</text>
  <text start="76.05" dur="5.76">trying to get his travel ban through the</text>
  <text start="79.47" dur="4.59">court system and we know that the 9th</text>
  <text start="81.81" dur="5.76">Circuit Court they keep shooting it down</text>
  <text start="84.06" dur="6.66">so he decided to rewrite it he submitted</text>
  <text start="87.57" dur="4.98">it and now he&amp;#39;s taking it to the US</text>
  <text start="90.72" dur="4.2">Supreme Court and they&amp;#39;ve agreed to hear</text>
  <text start="92.55" dur="4.2">arguments in favor and against the</text>
  <text start="94.92" dur="3.54">executive order banning entry into the</text>
  <text start="96.75" dur="3.96">United States of passport holders from</text>
  <text start="98.46" dur="5.519">Libya Yemen Syria Somalia Sudan and Iran</text>
  <text start="100.71" dur="6.15">the highest court in the u.s. found that</text>
  <text start="103.979" dur="5.911">prior decisions by lower court&amp;#39;s pausing</text>
  <text start="106.86" dur="4.98">the band were not in order and that</text>
  <text start="109.89" dur="3.81">until October when the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="111.84" dur="3.389">will hear arguments the majority of</text>
  <text start="113.7" dur="3.57">points from the executive order</text>
  <text start="115.229" dur="4.171">including the banning entry into the</text>
  <text start="117.27" dur="4.11">u.s. of all individuals without travel</text>
  <text start="119.4" dur="5.67">documents including self proclaimed</text>
  <text start="121.38" dur="5.76">refugees can be enforced the only</text>
  <text start="125.07" dur="4.079">exceptions granted will be to</text>
  <text start="127.14" dur="4.95">individuals from countries in question</text>
  <text start="129.149" dur="4.981">who have family or other connections</text>
  <text start="132.09" dur="4.26">with the u.s. such as employment or</text>
  <text start="134.13" dur="4.56">enrollment in proper educational</text>
  <text start="136.35" dur="5.31">facilities now we see right now that</text>
  <text start="138.69" dur="5.64">Trump is out there he&amp;#39;s saying well as</text>
  <text start="141.66" dur="5.43">predicted the Ninth Circuit did it again</text>
  <text start="144.33" dur="5.49">ruled against the travel ban at such a</text>
  <text start="147.09" dur="6.33">dangerous time in history of our country</text>
  <text start="149.82" dur="6.18">and you can see at this point that this</text>
  <text start="153.42" dur="4.65">was completely legal and we went over</text>
  <text start="156" dur="4.94">this again and again and you can see</text>
  <text start="158.07" dur="6.449">that this was used as a political move</text>
  <text start="160.94" dur="6.519">against the Trump administration and the</text>
  <text start="164.519" dur="4.651">deep state which is intertwined into</text>
  <text start="167.459" dur="3.78">government which is really deep into</text>
  <text start="169.17" dur="5.58">government right now they were using</text>
  <text start="171.239" dur="5.791">their power to basically stop whatever</text>
  <text start="174.75" dur="4.26">he wanted to do and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="177.03" dur="5.19">doing this but we can see that tide is</text>
  <text start="179.01" dur="5.129">now turning now very interestingly the</text>
  <text start="182.22" dur="5.08">Supreme Court Supreme Court Justice</text>
  <text start="184.139" dur="6.701">Clarence Thomas he had some stir</text>
  <text start="187.3" dur="5.46">earn words for his colleagues when the</text>
  <text start="190.84" dur="5.22">court declined to hear a case</text>
  <text start="192.76" dur="5.58">challenging California&amp;#39;s handgun law</text>
  <text start="196.06" dur="4.49">saying that that jurists do not</text>
  <text start="198.34" dur="5.61">understand the importance of</text>
  <text start="200.55" dur="5.38">self-defense now this case supported by</text>
  <text start="203.95" dur="5.82">the National Rifle Association involves</text>
  <text start="205.93" dur="6.9">a San Diego resident Edward perotta who</text>
  <text start="209.77" dur="4.86">challenged his County&amp;#39;s refusal to grant</text>
  <text start="212.83" dur="4.5">him permission to carry a concealed</text>
  <text start="214.63" dur="6.18">firearm outside of his home now Clarence</text>
  <text start="217.33" dur="7.11">Thomas said the following after the</text>
  <text start="220.81" dur="6.99">other individuals declined to hear the</text>
  <text start="224.44" dur="5.88">California case he said for those of us</text>
  <text start="227.8" dur="5.43">who work in marbled halls guarded</text>
  <text start="230.32" dur="4.95">constantly by vigilant and dedicated</text>
  <text start="233.23" dur="4.23">police force the guarantees of the</text>
  <text start="235.27" dur="7.05">second amendment might seem antiquated</text>
  <text start="237.46" dur="6.96">and superfluous but the framers made a</text>
  <text start="242.32" dur="3.99">clear choice they reserved to all</text>
  <text start="244.42" dur="4.17">Americans the right to bear arms for</text>
  <text start="246.31" dur="5.55">self-defense I do not think we should</text>
  <text start="248.59" dur="6.03">stand by idly while a state denies its</text>
  <text start="251.86" dur="5.9">citizens that right particularly when</text>
  <text start="254.62" dur="8.73">their very lives may be dependent on it</text>
  <text start="257.76" dur="8.68">now justice Neel Gorsuch he backs Thomas</text>
  <text start="263.35" dur="6.03">and says yes we should hear this case</text>
  <text start="266.44" dur="5.13">now a case needs to be approved by at</text>
  <text start="269.38" dur="4.53">least four justices in order to get on</text>
  <text start="271.57" dur="4.29">the Supreme Court&amp;#39;s docket and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="273.91" dur="4.08">have to see if this actually does make</text>
  <text start="275.86" dur="4.95">it because again they&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="277.99" dur="7.23">that yes the Second Amendment allows</text>
  <text start="280.81" dur="7.62">every single person to have and to carry</text>
  <text start="285.22" dur="5.43">a weapon and it&amp;#39;s good that this is</text>
  <text start="288.43" dur="4.32">being pushed through the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="290.65" dur="3.78">and they should hear it and there should</text>
  <text start="292.75" dur="2.97">be a ruling on actually this doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="294.43" dur="3.06">even really need to be a ruling on it</text>
  <text start="295.72" dur="3.54">because right now he should have said</text>
  <text start="297.49" dur="5.1">that they&amp;#39;re actually violating the</text>
  <text start="299.26" dur="5.01">Second Amendment but again we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="302.59" dur="4.26">through what the deep state has set up</text>
  <text start="304.27" dur="4.71">over a very long time where their push</text>
  <text start="306.85" dur="4.53">was to remove weapons from every single</text>
  <text start="308.98" dur="4.77">person and we can see that things are</text>
  <text start="311.38" dur="3.96">now starting to head the other way and</text>
  <text start="313.75" dur="2.85">we can see that never really worked out</text>
  <text start="315.34" dur="3.87">anyhow because every time they try to</text>
  <text start="316.6" dur="3.83">push their agenda what happened people</text>
  <text start="319.21" dur="4.67">bought more</text>
  <text start="320.43" dur="5.7">weapons now we see that the chairman of</text>
  <text start="323.88" dur="6.03">the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph</text>
  <text start="326.13" dur="6.09">Dunford he arrived in Afghanistan he is</text>
  <text start="329.91" dur="4.74">looking at Afghanistan looking at what</text>
  <text start="332.22" dur="5.01">needs to be done there and again we have</text>
  <text start="334.65" dur="4.47">to look at this and say okay now is this</text>
  <text start="337.23" dur="2.94">still part of the deep state where</text>
  <text start="339.12" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re going to be bringing in these</text>
  <text start="340.17" dur="3.87">troops if they are are they going to be</text>
  <text start="342.51" dur="3.51">going after the Islamic state are they</text>
  <text start="344.04" dur="4.65">be going after the deep state are they</text>
  <text start="346.02" dur="6.51">going to be moving to allow Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="348.69" dur="6">to operate on its own or are they going</text>
  <text start="352.53" dur="3.45">in there to control Afghanistan with</text>
  <text start="354.69" dur="3.84">more troops this is what we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="355.98" dur="4.71">at right now and the the big question is</text>
  <text start="358.53" dur="4.83">you know what are they going to do there</text>
  <text start="360.69" dur="4.26">now we need to understand is that they</text>
  <text start="363.36" dur="3.98">keep saying that they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="364.95" dur="5.04">coming up with a completely new plan a</text>
  <text start="367.34" dur="5.14">fundamental change from the Obama</text>
  <text start="369.99" dur="4.14">administration&amp;#39;s policy now we know what</text>
  <text start="372.48" dur="3.84">Obama was doing he was working with the</text>
  <text start="374.13" dur="3.66">deep state we know they supported the</text>
  <text start="376.32" dur="2.73">Islamic state they were never bombing</text>
  <text start="377.79" dur="3.36">the Islamic state no matter where they</text>
  <text start="379.05" dur="4.44">were they put the Islamic state where</text>
  <text start="381.15" dur="4.5">they wanted them and they use them in</text>
  <text start="383.49" dur="4.44">each one of these countries now we see</text>
  <text start="385.65" dur="3.99">the opposite happening where they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="387.93" dur="4.47">going to be using those policies the</text>
  <text start="389.64" dur="4.11">Pentagon this certain division is going</text>
  <text start="392.4" dur="3.99">to be calling the shots because we know</text>
  <text start="393.75" dur="4.47">that the Pentagon and many of the</text>
  <text start="396.39" dur="4.77">government agencies they have rogue</text>
  <text start="398.22" dur="5.19">elements within them and again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="401.16" dur="5.1">not all controlled they&amp;#39;re doing things</text>
  <text start="403.41" dur="5.01">on their own and we can see this out in</text>
  <text start="406.26" dur="4.23">Syria we can see it out in Iraq we can</text>
  <text start="408.42" dur="4.58">see it in Afghanistan and we see right</text>
  <text start="410.49" dur="7.35">now that they&amp;#39;re pushing an agenda to</text>
  <text start="413" dur="7.81">basically route out the deep state to</text>
  <text start="417.84" dur="6.21">remove the Islamic state now mattis is</text>
  <text start="420.81" dur="5.4">supposedly going to Ukraine now we know</text>
  <text start="424.05" dur="5.04">in Ukraine it was a coup d&amp;#39;etat we know</text>
  <text start="426.21" dur="5.1">the u.s. came in removed the elected</text>
  <text start="429.09" dur="4.95">leader put in a puppet government and</text>
  <text start="431.31" dur="6.06">this started the whole problem with</text>
  <text start="434.04" dur="5.45">Russia and right now the Pentagon right</text>
  <text start="437.37" dur="4.8">now has no comment regarding a</text>
  <text start="439.49" dur="5.74">possibility of US Defense Secretary Jim</text>
  <text start="442.17" dur="5.04">mattis visiting the Ukraine but there</text>
  <text start="445.23" dur="4.41">are some saying that it is scheduled and</text>
  <text start="447.21" dur="4.53">we need to realize that he&amp;#39;s going there</text>
  <text start="449.64" dur="3.86">for a specific reason is he going there</text>
  <text start="451.74" dur="4.43">to give arms to</text>
  <text start="453.5" dur="5.61">crane to go after the southeastern</text>
  <text start="456.17" dur="5.91">nation or is he going there to try to</text>
  <text start="459.11" dur="6.42">reverse things from the coup d&amp;#39;etat and</text>
  <text start="462.08" dur="8.16">this is again what we are looking at now</text>
  <text start="465.53" dur="7.02">it looks like some congressmen have</text>
  <text start="470.24" dur="4.23">urged the White House to pull out from</text>
  <text start="472.55" dur="5.61">the intermediate-range nuclear forces</text>
  <text start="474.47" dur="5.64">treaty the INF treaty between Washington</text>
  <text start="478.16" dur="3.33">and Moscow now they&amp;#39;ve been trying to</text>
  <text start="480.11" dur="4.38">make this point that Russia has violated</text>
  <text start="481.49" dur="5.1">the treaty Russia is saying no it was</text>
  <text start="484.49" dur="3.63">the u.s. that violated the treaty and</text>
  <text start="486.59" dur="3.6">they turned it around to make it look</text>
  <text start="488.12" dur="3.84">like Russia violated the treaty but we</text>
  <text start="490.19" dur="3.24">can see that the United States through</text>
  <text start="491.96" dur="4.56">the deep state and we have to remember</text>
  <text start="493.43" dur="5.82">Democrats Republican they are part of</text>
  <text start="496.52" dur="4.98">the same system the neocons the deep</text>
  <text start="499.25" dur="5.16">state and a lot of the Republicans are</text>
  <text start="501.5" dur="5.88">not working with Trump but we could see</text>
  <text start="504.41" dur="5.009">right now they want to pull out of the</text>
  <text start="507.38" dur="4.68">INF treaty want to get rid of all the</text>
  <text start="509.419" dur="5.281">treaties and the way they do this is</text>
  <text start="512.06" dur="5.94">they make it look like the other country</text>
  <text start="514.7" dur="5.13">violated violated the treaty so they can</text>
  <text start="518" dur="3.56">get out of it and this is what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="519.83" dur="4.86">been doing then Russia is saying listen</text>
  <text start="521.56" dur="5.38">we know what is going on here we</text>
  <text start="524.69" dur="5.91">understand and if you pull out of the</text>
  <text start="526.94" dur="6.69">treaty the US will be the country that</text>
  <text start="530.6" dur="6.18">violated everything that we had in the</text>
  <text start="533.63" dur="5.19">treaty and we know this is what the deep</text>
  <text start="536.78" dur="5.07">state has been doing because eventually</text>
  <text start="538.82" dur="4.74">what they want is a war with Russia</text>
  <text start="541.85" dur="5.04">this is what they&amp;#39;ve been trying to do</text>
  <text start="543.56" dur="5.58">for a very long time now United States</text>
  <text start="546.89" dur="4.5">senator bob Corker chairman of the</text>
  <text start="549.14" dur="4.53">Senate Foreign Relations Committee said</text>
  <text start="551.39" dur="4.98">that he&amp;#39;s going to withhold consent for</text>
  <text start="553.67" dur="5.64">us arms sales to members of the Gulf</text>
  <text start="556.37" dur="4.86">Cooperation Council until there is a</text>
  <text start="559.31" dur="3.39">path forward to resolving the dispute in</text>
  <text start="561.23" dur="4.26">the region and we know this is the</text>
  <text start="562.7" dur="5.34">dispute with guitar now what is</text>
  <text start="565.49" dur="6.69">happening out there is many different</text>

  <text start="572.18" dur="6.96">right now is working with Iran and it</text>
  <text start="576.11" dur="5.52">looks like they want closer relations we</text>
  <text start="579.14" dur="5.25">see that the Iranian president Hassan</text>
  <text start="581.63" dur="5.8">rouhani is saying that yes we want to</text>
  <text start="584.39" dur="5.92">bolster ties with guitar we also seek</text>
  <text start="587.43" dur="6.87">car has ease restrictions for Russians</text>
  <text start="590.31" dur="5.969">entering the country now we need to</text>
  <text start="594.3" dur="4.77">think about what is happening here and</text>
  <text start="596.279" dur="4.921">look at all the different agendas we see</text>
  <text start="599.07" dur="4.889">that Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates</text>
  <text start="601.2" dur="5.16">Bahrain and the rest have called out</text>
  <text start="603.959" dur="4.801">Qatar and said you need to stop</text>
  <text start="606.36" dur="5.4">supporting the terrasse well at this</text>
  <text start="608.76" dur="4.47">point they don&amp;#39;t need the terrorist</text>
  <text start="611.76" dur="4.32">groups anymore because they are now</text>
  <text start="613.23" dur="4.859">being beat in Syria and we can see that</text>
  <text start="616.08" dur="4.23">the Trump administration they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="618.089" dur="5.37">actually going to be going after the</text>
  <text start="620.31" dur="5.43">terrorist groups they know who supports</text>
  <text start="623.459" dur="5.101">them they know who funds then they know</text>
  <text start="625.74" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s the deep state and this is why they</text>
  <text start="628.56" dur="4.469">keep saying that we&amp;#39;re going to go off</text>
  <text start="630.27" dur="6.569">on a different plan right now than what</text>
  <text start="633.029" dur="6.571">Obama had so let&amp;#39;s think about this for</text>
  <text start="636.839" dur="7.44">a second the reason they always wanted</text>
  <text start="639.6" dur="7.679">Syria is to build a pipeline through</text>
  <text start="644.279" dur="8.101">Syria into Europe the pipeline was going</text>
  <text start="647.279" dur="7.68">to originate in Qatar now we have Russia</text>
  <text start="652.38" dur="4.95">working with Turkey and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="654.959" dur="3.451">be building the Turkish pipeline which</text>
  <text start="657.33" dur="2.82">has already started going to be</text>
  <text start="658.41" dur="4.71">completed one of the pipes are going to</text>
  <text start="660.15" dur="7.08">be completed in 2018 so there&amp;#39;s a race</text>
  <text start="663.12" dur="8.04">against time in Syria we see that Russia</text>
  <text start="667.23" dur="7.2">the Iranian forces the Syrian forces</text>
  <text start="671.16" dur="5.73">they are decimating the Islamic state al</text>
  <text start="674.43" dur="4.11">Qaeda al sham and moderate rebels they</text>
  <text start="676.89" dur="4.65">are liberating more and more towns and</text>
  <text start="678.54" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re pushing east and south we see</text>
  <text start="681.54" dur="5.04">that the United States has lost the</text>
  <text start="683.73" dur="4.95">border to the Syrian government and the</text>

  <text start="871.259" dur="6.39">National Defense Forces and everything</text>
  <text start="874.5" dur="5.579">is happening all at once so we can see</text>
  <text start="877.649" dur="4.11">that things are really being played out</text>
  <text start="880.079" dur="4.471">right in front of us there&amp;#39;s a battle</text>
  <text start="881.759" dur="4.621">between what Trump is doing and the deep</text>
  <text start="884.55" dur="3.63">state and you can see it all happening</text>
  <text start="886.38" dur="6.12">right in front of us now something very</text>
  <text start="888.18" dur="7.139">interestingly since Russia since Syria</text>
  <text start="892.5" dur="5.67">has liberated and cleared out many</text>
  <text start="895.319" dur="5.431">cities towns villages provinces we see</text>
  <text start="898.17" dur="4.74">right now that tens of thousands of</text>
  <text start="900.75" dur="5.88">Syrians have been lining up at the</text>
  <text start="902.91" dur="7.08">border to return to the liberated areas</text>
  <text start="906.63" dur="5.67">in Syria now there are thousands upon</text>
  <text start="909.99" dur="3.899">thousands of individuals who want to</text>
  <text start="912.3" dur="3.659">return actually they&amp;#39;re estimating about</text>
  <text start="913.889" dur="5.341">a hundred and eleven thousand Syrians</text>
  <text start="915.959" dur="6.331">who crossed back into Syria from Turkey</text>
  <text start="919.23" dur="5.459">and we can see at this point that people</text>
  <text start="922.29" dur="3.96">are now ready to return because the</text>
  <text start="924.689" dur="4.231">Islamic state has been cleared out of</text>
  <text start="926.25" dur="4.199">many of these areas and as more and more</text>

  <text start="930.449" dur="4.08">going to see more of these individuals</text>
  <text start="932.009" dur="4.591">come back so this is what really needs</text>
  <text start="934.529" dur="3.93">to happen we don&amp;#39;t need to accept all</text>
  <text start="936.6" dur="3.419">these refugees we have to remember the</text>
  <text start="938.459" dur="3.331">reason why we have all these refugees is</text>
  <text start="940.019" dur="3.451">because of the deeps say what United</text>
  <text start="941.79" dur="5.01">States deep state has done over the</text>
  <text start="943.47" dur="7.229">years to Somalia Sudan Iraq Lebanon</text>
  <text start="946.8" dur="6.24">Libya and Syria Ukraine this is where</text>
  <text start="950.699" dur="3.99">all the refugees came from if we let</text>
  <text start="953.04" dur="3.899">these people have their countries back</text>
  <text start="954.689" dur="3.75">they would go back to their country they</text>
  <text start="956.939" dur="3">don&amp;#39;t want to leave their country they</text>
  <text start="958.439" dur="4.38">want to make a life as long as there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="959.939" dur="4.32">no war they could live happily in their</text>
  <text start="962.819" dur="4.981">own countries like they did before</text>
  <text start="964.259" dur="6.361">before the deep state went in we see now</text>
  <text start="967.8" dur="5.94">that al-qaeda well they&amp;#39;re defecting to</text>
  <text start="970.62" dur="5.19">al sham now remember al sham was created</text>
  <text start="973.74" dur="4.289">because they weren&amp;#39;t on the terrorist</text>
  <text start="975.81" dur="3.629">list al Qaeda was on the terrorist list</text>
  <text start="978.029" dur="4.321">the Islamic state was on the terrorist</text>
  <text start="979.439" dur="4.71">list so we see right now al Qaeda a lot</text>
  <text start="982.35" dur="4.2">of members there they&amp;#39;re defecting to al</text>
  <text start="984.149" dur="4.441">sham because they realize what is</text>
  <text start="986.55" dur="3.18">happening they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="988.59" dur="2.97">through and they&amp;#39;re getting rid of all</text>
  <text start="989.73" dur="3.06">the terrorist groups and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="991.56" dur="2.43">well no no you can&amp;#39;t touch I&amp;#39;ll sham</text>
  <text start="992.79" dur="2.51">because we&amp;#39;re not a terrorist group</text>
  <text start="993.99" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re not listed as a terrorist group</text>
  <text start="995.3" dur="5.41">but Russia understands and they realize</text>
  <text start="998.49" dur="3.81">that this is the same exact terrorist</text>
  <text start="1000.71" dur="3.03">group they can rename all these groups</text>
  <text start="1002.3" dur="5.52">all they want it makes no difference</text>
  <text start="1003.74" dur="7.53">these are the same terrorist groups now</text>
  <text start="1007.82" dur="5.91">the head of the us-led coalition well he</text>
  <text start="1011.27" dur="5.55">just admitted that they&amp;#39;ve lost the race</text>
  <text start="1013.73" dur="7.14">for the border with Iraq to the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1016.82" dur="5.7">army and we can see at this point that</text>
  <text start="1020.87" dur="2.43">the United States does not control the</text>
  <text start="1022.52" dur="4.23">border anymore</text>
  <text start="1023.3" dur="7.44">and what is happening right now is the</text>
  <text start="1026.75" dur="6.99">deep state they&amp;#39;re losing a piece here a</text>
  <text start="1030.74" dur="5.28">piece there a paid mercenary terrorist</text>
  <text start="1033.74" dur="5.1">group over here and is happening very</text>
  <text start="1036.02" dur="5.19">very quickly and you can tell the deep</text>
  <text start="1038.84" dur="3.66">state doesn&amp;#39;t like this because remember</text>
  <text start="1041.21" dur="3.45">the corporate media is the mouthpiece</text>
  <text start="1042.5" dur="5.37">for the deep state and when you start to</text>
  <text start="1044.66" dur="6.93">hear stories like Donald Trump is</text>
  <text start="1047.87" dur="6.75">reckless on Syria it&amp;#39;s his most</text>
  <text start="1051.59" dur="5.22">dangerous foreign policy folly and when</text>
  <text start="1054.62" dur="3.87">they start saying that Trump has no idea</text>
  <text start="1056.81" dur="5.28">what he&amp;#39;s doing out there what this</text>
  <text start="1058.49" dur="7.68">really means is that they are losing the</text>
  <text start="1062.09" dur="6.54">battle in this area where he&amp;#39;s not doing</text>
  <text start="1066.17" dur="4.68">what they want it&amp;#39;s almost like when</text>
  <text start="1068.63" dur="4.71">they had the brexit and the central</text>
  <text start="1070.85" dur="4.86">bankers came out and said listen if you</text>
  <text start="1073.34" dur="5.25">vote YES for the referendum the entire</text>
  <text start="1075.71" dur="4.89">economic system in the UK is going to</text>
  <text start="1078.59" dur="3.48">completely crash and that was coming</text>
  <text start="1080.6" dur="3.36">from the central bank&amp;#39;s this is coming</text>
  <text start="1082.07" dur="4.68">from the deep state where they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1083.96" dur="4.68">the whole entire farm foreign policy is</text>
  <text start="1086.75" dur="2.25">a complete mess and he has no idea what</text>
  <text start="1088.64" dur="2.97">he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="1089" dur="5.01">no no he knows what he&amp;#39;s doing the</text>
  <text start="1091.61" dur="4.71">individuals in his administration that</text>
  <text start="1094.01" dur="4.47">are orchestrating all this they know</text>
  <text start="1096.32" dur="5.16">exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1098.48" dur="6.09">maneuvering to box the deep state in</text>
  <text start="1101.48" dur="4.76">they&amp;#39;re maneuvering to take control of</text>
  <text start="1104.57" dur="4.26">the situation</text>
  <text start="1106.24" dur="3.91">remember the deep state has been around</text>
  <text start="1108.83" dur="2.91">for a very long time they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1110.15" dur="1.89">pushing these policies for a very long</text>
  <text start="1111.74" dur="3.36">time</text>
  <text start="1112.04" dur="5.52">and you can see once these stories start</text>
  <text start="1115.1" dur="6.39">to come out and this was coming out of</text>
  <text start="1117.56" dur="4.239">the usatoday.com site they push these</text>
  <text start="1121.49" dur="3.37">two</text>
  <text start="1121.799" dur="4.431">ways to make it seem like they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1124.86" dur="5.72">know they don&amp;#39;t have a foreign policy</text>
  <text start="1126.23" dur="7.389">doesn&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on yes he does</text>
  <text start="1130.58" dur="6.429">these things are being done on purpose</text>
  <text start="1133.619" dur="6.03">just like firing the missiles into Syria</text>
  <text start="1137.009" dur="4.831">he knew there was no chemical attack I</text>
  <text start="1139.649" dur="4.47">mean think about the alternative media</text>
  <text start="1141.84" dur="3.899">knew there was no chemical attack he</text>
  <text start="1144.119" dur="4.38">knew there was no chemical attack this</text>
  <text start="1145.739" dur="5.52">is why he warned Syria and Russia ahead</text>
  <text start="1148.499" dur="6.351">of time yes through backchannels to</text>
  <text start="1151.259" dur="6.42">clear the base of planes soldiers and</text>
  <text start="1154.85" dur="4.209">they also had Russia shoot down some of</text>
  <text start="1157.679" dur="5.13">the missiles that&amp;#39;s why a lot of them</text>
  <text start="1159.059" dur="4.881">never even made it this was all done on</text>
  <text start="1162.809" dur="5.55">purpose</text>
  <text start="1163.94" dur="7">to control the narrative to control what</text>
  <text start="1168.359" dur="5.371">was going on there to show that he was</text>
  <text start="1170.94" dur="4.979">in control now of course the corporate</text>
  <text start="1173.73" dur="4.559">media they went on like oh yes he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1175.919" dur="3.63">doing exactly what we want he&amp;#39;s firing</text>
  <text start="1178.289" dur="3.151">he&amp;#39;s going to be bringing troops we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1179.549" dur="7.31">going to be invading Syria it never</text>
  <text start="1181.44" dur="8.359">happened this was planned as a complete</text>
  <text start="1186.859" dur="6.13">diversion of what was really going on</text>
  <text start="1189.799" dur="5.5">the same thing is happening out in Qatar</text>
  <text start="1192.989" dur="2.88">the same thing is happening in Syria</text>
  <text start="1195.299" dur="2.161">right now</text>
  <text start="1195.869" dur="4.4">the same thing will be happening now in</text>
  <text start="1197.46" dur="7.26">Afghanistan and all of these areas</text>
  <text start="1200.269" dur="6.941">things are changing very slowly because</text>
  <text start="1204.72" dur="6.839">again the deep state still has control</text>
  <text start="1207.21" dur="8.37">the deep state still has its claws in</text>
  <text start="1211.559" dur="8.07">the system and it takes a very long and</text>
  <text start="1215.58" dur="6.449">very tedious task of removing them and</text>
  <text start="1219.629" dur="4.5">you could see he tried doing this in the</text>
  <text start="1222.029" dur="4.98">beginning and it didn&amp;#39;t work out that</text>
  <text start="1224.129" dur="5.61">well but you can see the narrative is</text>
  <text start="1227.009" dur="5.28">now switching and moving to his side</text>
  <text start="1229.739" dur="3.93">look what happened with Comey look</text>
  <text start="1232.289" dur="3.301">what&amp;#39;s happening with the travel ban</text>

  <text start="1240.299" dur="3.901">to see a lot of things change now the</text>
  <text start="1242.639" dur="4.801">only thing we need to worry about is</text>
  <text start="1244.2" dur="5.459">what the deep state is going to do are</text>
  <text start="1247.44" dur="4.859">they going to sit back and just say okay</text>
  <text start="1249.659" dur="5.611">we lost this no they&amp;#39;re most likely</text>
  <text start="1252.299" dur="5.191">going to create an event of all</text>
  <text start="1255.27" dur="3.81">Vence and this is what we&amp;#39;re monitoring</text>
  <text start="1257.49" dur="4.38">this is what we&amp;#39;re looking at because we</text>
  <text start="1259.08" dur="5.31">can see right now things are going to</text>
  <text start="1261.87" dur="4.35">get to a point where they&amp;#39;ll have no</text>
