  <text start="121.35" dur="2.969">the corporate media and everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="122.789" dur="3.991">trying to make it seem like everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="124.319" dur="6.031">all better the capital controls are</text>
  <text start="126.78" dur="5.34">coming up this spring in may will be</text>
  <text start="130.35" dur="3.3">completely gone and we&amp;#39;ll have to see if</text>
  <text start="132.12" dur="4.979">that actually happens because they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="133.65" dur="5.91">said this many times before during the</text>
  <text start="137.099" dur="3.101">whole year of 2013 and nothing has ever</text>
  <text start="139.56" dur="3.1">happened</text>
  <text start="140.2" dur="4.8">here we are in the spring they said late</text>
  <text start="142.66" dur="3.39">May they&amp;#39;re going to remove all capital</text>
  <text start="145" dur="5.22">controls and we&amp;#39;ll see if they actually</text>
  <text start="146.05" dur="7.5">do this but Cyprus has been hit very</text>
  <text start="150.22" dur="4.83">hard and I understand you know we all</text>
  <text start="153.55" dur="3.45">understand that they&amp;#39;re getting bailouts</text>
  <text start="155.05" dur="4.049">and bail and they had balance where they</text>
  <text start="157" dur="5.01">took the people&amp;#39;s money but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="159.099" dur="5.551">seeing now is people really don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="162.01" dur="6.57">work unemployment is continually rising</text>
  <text start="164.65" dur="7.05">and right now the register of companies</text>
  <text start="168.58" dur="5.82">has been reported as saying that one in</text>
  <text start="171.7" dur="4.71">for construction firms in Cyprus are</text>
  <text start="174.4" dur="3.99">going bankrupt due to the pressure</text>
  <text start="176.41" dur="5.13">caused by the islands financial crisis</text>
  <text start="178.39" dur="5.48">so they&amp;#39;re having a very rough time</text>
  <text start="181.54" dur="6">making ends meet and this crisis is</text>
  <text start="183.87" dur="5.44">nowhere over just like in Greece when</text>
  <text start="187.54" dur="3.419">they receive the first bailout everyone</text>
  <text start="189.31" dur="5.67">thought oh it&amp;#39;s all over everything is</text>
  <text start="190.959" dur="6.09">great it is not done this is going to</text>
  <text start="194.98" dur="5.43">wreak havoc on the people because as</text>
  <text start="197.049" dur="5.671">they take on more debt and they have to</text>
  <text start="200.41" dur="4.68">implement austerity we&amp;#39;re going to see a</text>
  <text start="202.72" dur="4.32">lot more businesses closed we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="205.09" dur="4.14">to see a lot more people out of work and</text>
  <text start="207.04" dur="4.289">all of a sudden we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="209.23" dur="3.839">unemployment continually rise and this</text>
  <text start="211.329" dur="3.961">is what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing and this does</text>
  <text start="213.069" dur="3.931">not stop it continually gets worse I</text>
  <text start="215.29" dur="3.539">mean Spain they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="217" dur="3.959">take a decade for unemployment to get</text>
  <text start="218.829" dur="4.5">better Greece they&amp;#39;re not seeing any</text>
  <text start="220.959" dur="4.411">improvement whatsoever actually it is</text>
  <text start="223.329" dur="4.141">getting worse now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="225.37" dur="3.78">interesting and I talked about how we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="227.47" dur="5.04">headed towards this economic collapse</text>
  <text start="229.15" dur="7.5">and I report on it every day about real</text>
  <text start="232.51" dur="8.069">estate retail and pretty much everything</text>
  <text start="236.65" dur="6.03">else about unemployment and people</text>
  <text start="240.579" dur="3.69">losing and getting laid off but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="242.68" dur="3.929">very interesting and I understand the</text>
  <text start="244.269" dur="5.22">elections are coming up and I am NOT</text>
  <text start="246.609" dur="5.641">before republic or Democrat I could care</text>
  <text start="249.489" dur="5.521">less I am for the people and this is</text>
  <text start="252.25" dur="5.94">what everyone should be for I mean these</text>
  <text start="255.01" dur="6.39">that feels like these two groups kind of</text>
  <text start="258.19" dur="6.3">divide us I rather us come together but</text>
  <text start="261.4" dur="5.22">right now before the elections they are</text>
  <text start="264.49" dur="5.04">saying that the Democrats should not</text>
  <text start="266.62" dur="6.18">discuss the economic recovery it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="269.53" dur="4.37">political loser and that should tell us</text>
  <text start="272.8" dur="3.679">something</text>
  <text start="273.9" dur="5.82">should tell us that there really isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="276.479" dur="6.601">an economic recovery and this goes on to</text>
  <text start="279.72" dur="6.6">say as a start Democrats should bury any</text>
  <text start="283.08" dur="6.99">mention of the recovery that message was</text>
  <text start="286.32" dur="7.099">tested and it lost why because the real</text>
  <text start="290.07" dur="6.99">everyday person who is out there</text>
  <text start="293.419" dur="7.361">understands it is very hard for them to</text>
  <text start="297.06" dur="7.59">make ends meet it is difficult for them</text>
  <text start="300.78" dur="7.02">to survive it is very hard to find jobs</text>
  <text start="304.65" dur="7.26">and yes you can find jobs but they are</text>
  <text start="307.8" dur="7.47">low paying jobs and this goes continues</text>
  <text start="311.91" dur="5.25">skip over how much trouble people are in</text>
  <text start="315.27" dur="4.88">and it doesn&amp;#39;t convince them that</text>
  <text start="317.16" dur="5.58">policymakers really understand or even</text>
  <text start="320.15" dur="4.72">focusing on the problems they continue</text>
  <text start="322.74" dur="5.459">to face many of the jobs that have been</text>
  <text start="324.87" dur="8">created our low-paying than the ones</text>
  <text start="328.199" dur="7.65">that preceded them how interesting</text>
  <text start="332.87" dur="7">because this is what we&amp;#39;ve been saying</text>
  <text start="335.849" dur="7.621">all along the jobs that are created now</text>
  <text start="339.87" dur="6.56">our lower-level jobs they do not have</text>
  <text start="343.47" dur="6.509">the same pay they do not have the same</text>
  <text start="346.43" dur="6.31">quality of jobs they are part-time or</text>
  <text start="349.979" dur="4.741">lower level jobs that people are getting</text>
  <text start="352.74" dur="6.299">at this time and we have to look at this</text>
  <text start="354.72" dur="8.85">because we are seeing that these huge</text>
  <text start="359.039" dur="6.901">companies barclays rps Bank of America</text>
  <text start="363.57" dur="4.17">JPMorgan Wells Fargo I mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="365.94" dur="5.159">laying off thousands upon thousands</text>
  <text start="367.74" dur="6.45">bedell sony where is we&amp;#39;re good we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="371.099" dur="5.07">all these people going to find work it</text>
  <text start="374.19" dur="4.68">is going to be very difficult they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="376.169" dur="4.591">going to find lower level work and those</text>
  <text start="378.87" dur="3.66">big houses that they have or those</text>
  <text start="380.76" dur="4.14">houses that they&amp;#39;re trying to support</text>
  <text start="382.53" dur="4.35">those are going to go into foreclosure</text>
  <text start="384.9" dur="4.019">because the jobs that they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="386.88" dur="6.45">will not be able to support this and we</text>
  <text start="388.919" dur="7.321">saw this happen during 2007 2002 2008 I</text>
  <text start="393.33" dur="7.2">reported on that the median income is</text>
  <text start="396.24" dur="7.02">continually falling prices inflation are</text>
  <text start="400.53" dur="5.189">is going up and this is not a good</text>
  <text start="403.26" dur="4.62">mixture for anything turning out well</text>
  <text start="405.719" dur="5.041">for any of us because as you</text>
  <text start="407.88" dur="5.16">salary goes down and energy and food</text>
  <text start="410.76" dur="5.04">continually Rises and other products it</text>
  <text start="413.04" dur="5.7">continually rises we know there is</text>
  <text start="415.8" dur="4.68">something wrong and this went on to say</text>
  <text start="418.74" dur="4.08">that a message about the benefits of</text>
  <text start="420.48" dur="5.46">recovery doesn&amp;#39;t really reflect their</text>
  <text start="422.82" dur="6.36">lives currently and of course it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="425.94" dur="7.59">because we understand this recovery is a</text>
  <text start="429.18" dur="6.99">complete illusion it is fake it is made</text>
  <text start="433.53" dur="4.74">up it is made up with manipulated</text>
  <text start="436.17" dur="4.32">numbers in GDP unemployment inflation</text>
  <text start="438.27" dur="4.08">and now the Census Bureau is going to</text>
  <text start="440.49" dur="4.95">manipulate Obamacare to make that look</text>
  <text start="442.35" dur="5.31">better this whole thing was completely</text>
  <text start="445.44" dur="5.19">created to convince the majority of the</text>
  <text start="447.66" dur="5.19">people that everything is fine and this</text>
  <text start="450.63" dur="4.08">is why they had to continually pump up</text>
  <text start="452.85" dur="4.17">the stock market to make everyone</text>
  <text start="454.71" dur="4.38">believe that we were in some type of</text>
  <text start="457.02" dur="6.27">recovery and this happened back in 1929</text>
  <text start="459.09" dur="6.42">and prior to 2008 where the stock market</text>
  <text start="463.29" dur="3.75">was hitting all-time new highs people</text>
  <text start="465.51" dur="2.94">believe that everything was fine they</text>
  <text start="467.04" dur="2.85">believe what the Fed was saying they</text>
  <text start="468.45" dur="4.59">believe what the government was saying</text>
  <text start="469.89" dur="5.46">and then all of a sudden everything just</text>
  <text start="473.04" dur="4.32">came crashing down the same things going</text>
  <text start="475.35" dur="6.24">to happen here and they know it they</text>
  <text start="477.36" dur="7.26">understand what is happening okay now</text>
  <text start="481.59" dur="7.4">Obama just signed the terrorist activity</text>
  <text start="484.62" dur="6.72">law aimed at boring Iranian UN envoy and</text>
  <text start="488.99" dur="4.98">what is really happening here this</text>
  <text start="491.34" dur="4.68">reminds me of the NDAA it seems like</text>
  <text start="493.97" dur="4.39">anyone that they want to say is a</text>
  <text start="496.02" dur="4.74">terrorist or had terrorist activities</text>
  <text start="498.36" dur="5.91">they don&amp;#39;t want them becoming a UN envoy</text>
  <text start="500.76" dur="5.7">at this time and they put this law into</text>
  <text start="504.27" dur="4.23">place not just for Iran but I think for</text>
  <text start="506.46" dur="4.68">many other countries I think they were</text>
  <text start="508.5" dur="6.18">using Iran to get this going because</text>
  <text start="511.14" dur="6.41">they you know Washington understands</text>
  <text start="514.68" dur="6.21">that most of the people in Washington</text>
  <text start="517.55" dur="4.84">fear Iran they fear that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="520.89" dur="3.75">to attack the United States with a</text>
  <text start="522.39" dur="4.02">nuclear weapon they fear that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="524.64" dur="4.02">going to do some type of terrorist act</text>
  <text start="526.41" dur="4.38">and again Iran hasn&amp;#39;t you know attacked</text>
  <text start="528.66" dur="3.6">anyone in the last 200 years they</text>
  <text start="530.79" dur="3.57">haven&amp;#39;t bombed anyone they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="532.26" dur="5.22">attacked anyone they have they&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="534.36" dur="5.34">used terrorist activities in the United</text>
  <text start="537.48" dur="4.049">States or pretty much anywhere else at</text>
  <text start="539.7" dur="4.86">this point so really</text>
  <text start="541.529" dur="8.281">we&amp;#39;re looking at I believed they use</text>
  <text start="544.56" dur="8.219">this Iran envoy who was involved in the</text>
  <text start="549.81" dur="5.1">coup in Iran in 1979 to remove this</text>
  <text start="552.779" dur="4.771">private western central bankers and to</text>
  <text start="554.91" dur="4.049">remove the United States from there</text>
  <text start="557.55" dur="4.769">because they didn&amp;#39;t want them</text>
  <text start="558.959" dur="6.06">controlling the money supply in the</text>
  <text start="562.319" dur="5.19">country anymore and they are using this</text>
  <text start="565.019" dur="5.07">to apply to every other country because</text>
  <text start="567.509" dur="5.341">as time goes on they&amp;#39;re going to say you</text>
  <text start="570.089" dur="4.92">know what this Russian you un envoy we</text>
  <text start="572.85" dur="3.779">do not want he&amp;#39;s a terrorist this North</text>
  <text start="575.009" dur="3.031">Korean is a terrorist and I think this</text>
  <text start="576.629" dur="4.01">is what they&amp;#39;re going to start doing and</text>
  <text start="578.04" dur="5.339">this is why they wanted this law passed</text>
  <text start="580.639" dur="6.221">now I&amp;#39;ve discussed this in many reports</text>
  <text start="583.379" dur="5.94">and and we understand that the United</text>
  <text start="586.86" dur="6.539">States the central bankers love to</text>
  <text start="589.319" dur="6.721">slowly take away our rights and they do</text>
  <text start="593.399" dur="4.86">this one step at a time so you really</text>
  <text start="596.04" dur="4.32">can&amp;#39;t notice it happening and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="598.259" dur="5.221">seeing is we&amp;#39;re seeing that they are</text>
  <text start="600.36" dur="6.06">taking away our rights very slowly they</text>
  <text start="603.48" dur="5.49">they make it seem like they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="606.42" dur="4.76">help us when they really aren&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="608.97" dur="5.64">give you an example the clive in bundy</text>
  <text start="611.18" dur="5.469">crisis that was happening in nevada they</text>
  <text start="614.61" dur="4.469">set up the First Amendment or the free</text>
  <text start="616.649" dur="4.62">speech area and they&amp;#39;re slowly trying to</text>
  <text start="619.079" dur="3.93">convince us that this is for our safety</text>
  <text start="621.269" dur="3.63">this is the area that you need to go on</text>
  <text start="623.009" dur="4.62">and soon they&amp;#39;ll say well you know what</text>
  <text start="624.899" dur="4.41">in this in this entire area there is no</text>
  <text start="627.629" dur="5">free speech you have to go to the next</text>
  <text start="629.309" dur="5.22">state and they do this very slowly very</text>
  <text start="632.629" dur="3.971">incrementally and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="634.529" dur="4.591">that a lot of our rights have been taken</text>
  <text start="636.6" dur="5.219">away and if we look at this that the</text>
  <text start="639.12" dur="4.889">federal government has set up its secret</text>
  <text start="641.819" dur="4.591">FISA courts to rubber-stamp NSA</text>

  <text start="820.62" dur="7.95">say oh my god what just happened now we</text>
  <text start="825.57" dur="4.86">understand in Ukraine they had this</text>

  <text start="835.95" dur="6.06">de-escalation I mean let&amp;#39;s look at this</text>
  <text start="838.8" dur="5.52">we have the protesters in Donetsk and</text>
  <text start="842.01" dur="5.22">other regions who occupy the government</text>

  <text start="861.98" dur="6.49">Crimea and more sanctions are on the way</text>
  <text start="865.17" dur="6.42">we have the CIA director in Ukraine</text>

  <text start="876.84" dur="5.82">equipment and military asses and</text>
  <text start="878.79" dur="7.41">bringing more in so where is the</text>
  <text start="882.66" dur="6.87">de-escalation I don&amp;#39;t see it and right</text>
  <text start="886.2" dur="5.31">now the EU the opposite the I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>
  <text start="889.53" dur="3.81">the opposition leader has cold on the</text>
  <text start="891.51" dur="4.53">European Union to impose more sanctions</text>
  <text start="893.34" dur="4.74">on Russia in the event of what she</text>

  <text start="907.29" dur="3.69">level of sanctions on Moscow of the</text>
  <text start="909" dur="4.53">Russian troops which there aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="910.98" dur="6.09">Russian troops they are allowed to be in</text>
  <text start="913.53" dur="5.19">Crimea because it&amp;#39;s now with Russia they</text>
  <text start="917.07" dur="3.66">don&amp;#39;t believe it&amp;#39;s with Russia they</text>
  <text start="918.72" dur="4.74">still think it&amp;#39;s with three Ukraine but</text>
  <text start="920.73" dur="4.92">those troops are there they have a base</text>
  <text start="923.46" dur="4.5">there there are no troops being built up</text>
  <text start="925.65" dur="4.5">on the borders there&amp;#39;s no troops in</text>
  <text start="927.96" dur="4.38">Donetsk and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="930.15" dur="4.32">continually with the continually using</text>
  <text start="932.34" dur="5.13">this propaganda to convince people but</text>
  <text start="934.47" dur="6.87">what I see I&amp;#39;m seeing NATO maneuvering I</text>
  <text start="937.47" dur="5.46">see more troops being spread around now</text>
  <text start="941.34" dur="3.99">US has gone to the</text>
  <text start="942.93" dur="3.93">ployed troops to Poland Poland and the</text>
  <text start="945.33" dur="4.11">United States will announce next week</text>
  <text start="946.86" dur="4.95">the deployment of us ground forces to</text>
  <text start="949.44" dur="5.76">Poland as part of an expansion of NATO</text>
  <text start="951.81" dur="5.88">and in their bringing in at least I</text>
  <text start="955.2" dur="6.12">think it&amp;#39;s around 10,000 troops into</text>
  <text start="957.69" dur="5.55">this area the role there there will also</text>
  <text start="961.32" dur="5.13">be intensified cooperation in air</text>
  <text start="963.24" dur="5.64">defence special forces cyber defense and</text>
  <text start="966.45" dur="5.4">other areas Poland will play a leading</text>
  <text start="968.88" dur="4.709">regional role under us patronage so we</text>
  <text start="971.85" dur="3.69">can see that this is not being</text>
  <text start="973.589" dur="5.611">deescalate it and now let me just say</text>
  <text start="975.54" dur="6.72">this when a country continually brings</text>
  <text start="979.2" dur="5.46">in more military assets when a country</text>
  <text start="982.26" dur="5.04">continually brings in more troops and</text>
  <text start="984.66" dur="6.119">puts it in Poland puts it in Romania</text>
  <text start="987.3" dur="6.21">brings ships into the Black Sea enhances</text>
  <text start="990.779" dur="5.93">the missile shield in Poland down to</text>
  <text start="993.51" dur="6.63">Romania this is not a peaceful</text>
  <text start="996.709" dur="7.69">de-escalation this is a slow buildup of</text>
  <text start="1000.14" dur="8.76">troops over weeks and months this leads</text>
  <text start="1004.399" dur="8.341">to war this does not lead to peace and</text>
  <text start="1008.9" dur="6.09">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the u.s. may</text>
  <text start="1012.74" dur="4.68">adjust its missile defense in Europe and</text>
  <text start="1014.99" dur="4.469">made a rising tensions with Russia the</text>
  <text start="1017.42" dur="4.02">US Defense chief said Washington its</text>
  <text start="1019.459" dur="5.13">allies may adjust the timing for</text>
  <text start="1021.44" dur="6.93">fielding anti-missile systems in Europe</text>
  <text start="1024.589" dur="6.531">the Secretary has also emphasized that a</text>
  <text start="1028.37" dur="6.209">US missile defense system in Europe</text>
  <text start="1031.12" dur="6.01">though are not a threat to Russia so</text>
  <text start="1034.579" dur="4.531">they&amp;#39;re saying that they do have the US</text>
  <text start="1037.13" dur="4.26">missile defense system in Europe but</text>
  <text start="1039.11" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s really not pointing to Russia which</text>
  <text start="1041.39" dur="4.02">we know it really is they have it there</text>
  <text start="1043.64" dur="4.41">for North Korea they had it there for</text>
  <text start="1045.41" dur="5.64">Iran and for Russia this is why this</text>
  <text start="1048.05" dur="5.58">system was set up now Senator corkers</text>
  <text start="1051.05" dur="5.64">out there and he&amp;#39;s saying it&amp;#39;s time to</text>
  <text start="1053.63" dur="5.64">consider sending weapons to Ukraine well</text>
  <text start="1056.69" dur="7.59">I&amp;#39;m going to say most likely they are</text>
  <text start="1059.27" dur="8.76">already being maneuvered and placed into</text>
  <text start="1064.28" dur="6.69">Ukraine and this is being covertly done</text>
  <text start="1068.03" dur="5.54">that&amp;#39;s why the CIA is there they did the</text>
  <text start="1070.97" dur="5.25">same thing in Syria they had other</text>
  <text start="1073.57" dur="4.39">factions do this for the</text>
  <text start="1076.22" dur="4.319">united states so unit united states</text>
  <text start="1077.96" dur="4.98">couldn&amp;#39;t be implicated in it the CIA is</text>
  <text start="1080.539" dur="4.321">directing the whole entire operation and</text>
  <text start="1082.94" dur="4.53">this is what&amp;#39;s happening right now but</text>
  <text start="1084.86" dur="4.17">and corker goes on to say it is time for</text>
  <text start="1087.47" dur="4.89">the united states to provide lethal</text>
  <text start="1089.03" dur="6.779">weapons for ukraine&amp;#39;s military and he</text>
  <text start="1092.36" dur="5.97">said that it&amp;#39;s time for us to consider</text>
  <text start="1095.809" dur="6.451">anti take weaponry anti-aircraft</text>
  <text start="1098.33" dur="6.209">weaponry rather than wait for a russian</text>

  <text start="1109.88" dur="4.59">action now that will help prevent this</text>
  <text start="1112.49" dur="4.35">worst-case scenario before it becomes a</text>
