  <text start="139.2" dur="6.08">of its branches across the country and</text>
  <text start="141.65" dur="7.87">we understand that banks are struggling</text>
  <text start="145.28" dur="6.96">we&amp;#39;re realizing that banks are coming in</text>
  <text start="149.52" dur="5.31">with their revenues and they are down</text>
  <text start="152.24" dur="6.4">we&amp;#39;re seeing that IBM&amp;#39;s revenues are</text>
  <text start="154.83" dur="6.54">down but that doesn&amp;#39;t matter they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="158.64" dur="4.32">buying back their stock they&amp;#39;re pumping</text>
  <text start="161.37" dur="3.45">up the market</text>

  <text start="164.82" dur="6.63">global default rise around the world the</text>
  <text start="169.56" dur="4.5">stock market is soaring to all-time new</text>
  <text start="171.45" dur="4.32">highs and a lot of the financial pundits</text>
  <text start="174.06" dur="3.51">are scratching the head saying you know</text>
  <text start="175.77" dur="4.44">son this is not really making sense</text>
  <text start="177.57" dur="5.15">right now it makes no sense that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="180.21" dur="5.73">rising but we&amp;#39;ll just go along with it</text>
  <text start="182.72" dur="7.3">now we understand there are bubbles all</text>
  <text start="185.94" dur="6.06">over the place now the central bank the</text>
  <text start="190.02" dur="4.83">US government they do have the ability</text>
  <text start="192" dur="4.8">to create these bubbles through loaning</text>
  <text start="194.85" dur="3.93">people money they can they can do it</text>
  <text start="196.8" dur="3.9">with the housing market they can do it</text>
  <text start="198.78" dur="4.35">with soon loan market they can do it</text>
  <text start="200.7" dur="4.98">with the auto loan market they have</text>
  <text start="203.13" dur="4.02">trouble in the retail area because many</text>
  <text start="205.68" dur="2.76">people do have credit cards but those</text>
  <text start="207.15" dur="4.59">are maxed out and you can&amp;#39;t really go</text>
  <text start="208.44" dur="5.04">for a loan to buy goods because we have</text>
  <text start="211.74" dur="3.96">to remember people are tapped out</text>
  <text start="213.48" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re losing their job their credit</text>
  <text start="215.7" dur="5.49">cards are maxed and this is why retail</text>
  <text start="218.37" dur="4.11">is contracting now the White House came</text>
  <text start="221.19" dur="3.24">out with a report because they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="222.48" dur="5.88">to convince everyone that getting a</text>
  <text start="224.43" dur="6.87">student loan is a good thing and their</text>
  <text start="228.36" dur="5.97">President Obama&amp;#39;s top economist they</text>
  <text start="231.3" dur="6.57">came out with this report saying that</text>
  <text start="234.33" dur="7.11">everyone has the student debt all wrong</text>
  <text start="237.87" dur="6.26">it&amp;#39;s completely wrong and that the</text>
  <text start="241.44" dur="6.74">massive increase in student debt is</text>
  <text start="244.13" dur="6.76">actually good for the economy it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="248.18" dur="5.92">reducing spending it&amp;#39;s not hurting</text>
  <text start="250.89" dur="4.83">retail and they came up with this</text>
  <text start="254.1" dur="4.17">conclusion that over a period of time</text>
  <text start="255.72" dur="4.59">these people that go to college they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="258.27" dur="4.68">make a lot more money than what their</text>
  <text start="260.31" dur="5.19">student debt is now of course that is</text>
  <text start="262.95" dur="5.37">true except for one factor this might</text>
  <text start="265.5" dur="10.23">have been the case back in the 70s the</text>
  <text start="268.32" dur="12.84">80s the 90s but right now you can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="275.73" dur="7.74">that job this is the problem I know many</text>
  <text start="281.16" dur="4.59">people that are graduating school a lot</text>
  <text start="283.47" dur="4.2">of debt they cannot find work actually a</text>
  <text start="285.75" dur="4.08">lot of people are emailing me letting me</text>
  <text start="287.67" dur="6.54">know the same problem is happening to</text>
  <text start="289.83" dur="6.93">them and there are other reports saying</text>
  <text start="294.21" dur="6.75">well this report is kind of</text>
  <text start="296.76" dur="7.59">the mark because what they&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="300.96" dur="6.38">that since these students can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="304.35" dur="5.91">those high-paying jobs after college</text>
  <text start="307.34" dur="5.08">they&amp;#39;re not really saving money and</text>
  <text start="310.26" dur="4.47">since they can&amp;#39;t get the jobs they have</text>
  <text start="312.42" dur="3.42">to live with their parents so if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="314.73" dur="3.21">living with their parents they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="315.84" dur="4.68">save money they&amp;#39;re not buying houses</text>
  <text start="317.94" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re not going out and buying things</text>
  <text start="320.52" dur="4.32">in the retail stores it&amp;#39;s becoming very</text>
  <text start="322.8" dur="7.32">difficult for them to make it every</text>
  <text start="324.84" dur="8.82">single day and we&amp;#39;re seeing that as the</text>
  <text start="330.12" dur="5.07">debt rises for these students it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="333.66" dur="4.17">becoming more and more difficult and</text>
  <text start="335.19" dur="6.06">it&amp;#39;s having a negative effect on the</text>
  <text start="337.83" dur="6.6">economy now of course they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="341.25" dur="5.04">convince everyone that student loan is a</text>
  <text start="344.43" dur="4.38">good thing because they want more people</text>
  <text start="346.29" dur="5.4">to take out student loans they want them</text>
  <text start="348.81" dur="5.73">to continually increase the bubble</text>
  <text start="351.69" dur="7.44">because remember there can&amp;#39;t be bailouts</text>
  <text start="354.54" dur="7.53">at this point for student loans the</text>
  <text start="359.13" dur="4.32">government can&amp;#39;t come in and say okay we</text>
  <text start="362.07" dur="3.96">have billions of dollars that are</text>
  <text start="363.45" dur="4.92">defaulted will just create more currency</text>
  <text start="366.03" dur="5.04">from the Fed will borrow it and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="368.37" dur="4.44">pay this off they can&amp;#39;t do that and this</text>
  <text start="371.07" dur="5.28">is why they need the student loan bubble</text>
  <text start="372.81" dur="7.26">to continually inflate as high and as</text>
  <text start="376.35" dur="7.89">big as it possibly can get now we talk a</text>
  <text start="380.07" dur="7.23">lot about the housing market and we are</text>
  <text start="384.24" dur="4.38">starting to see that these housing</text>
  <text start="387.3" dur="3.63">markets in all these different cities</text>
  <text start="388.62" dur="4.89">when we look at San Francisco we look at</text>
  <text start="390.93" dur="7.23">Dallas we look at Boston Atlanta Denver</text>
  <text start="393.51" dur="7.56">North Carolina Seattle and many other</text>
  <text start="398.16" dur="4.95">areas we&amp;#39;re starting to see the same</text>
  <text start="401.07" dur="4.56">thing that happened in 2008 it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="403.11" dur="5.22">deja vu all over again because when we</text>
  <text start="405.63" dur="8.06">look at Atlanta we saw it back in the</text>
  <text start="408.33" dur="7.76">peak of 06 05 and 06 we saw that Oh</text>
  <text start="413.69" dur="5.64">housing prices reached all-time highs</text>
  <text start="416.09" dur="8.4">we&amp;#39;re almost at that point once again in</text>
  <text start="419.33" dur="8.77">Boston were above the peak of 05 06 in</text>
  <text start="424.49" dur="5.6">Dallas were above the peak San Francisco</text>
  <text start="428.1" dur="3.91">were pretty much at the p</text>
  <text start="430.09" dur="4.43">and it&amp;#39;s the same for the rest of the</text>
  <text start="432.01" dur="6.45">cities so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="434.52" dur="6.33">exactly the same thing that we saw back</text>
  <text start="438.46" dur="8.22">in two thousand eight right before</text>
  <text start="440.85" dur="8.59">everything fell apart now before the</text>
  <text start="446.68" dur="5.459">financial crisis home prices jumped to</text>
  <text start="449.44" dur="5.28">do too easy credit no documentation no</text>
  <text start="452.139" dur="5.161">down payment record high work first</text>
  <text start="454.72" dur="5.729">numbers a four percent unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="457.3" dur="5.16">and this was for all intents and</text>
  <text start="460.449" dur="4.771">purposes the real unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="462.46" dur="6.57">where people actually had jobs and we</text>
  <text start="465.22" dur="6.93">had rising wages at the time today it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="469.03" dur="5.34">completely different the unemployment</text>
  <text start="472.15" dur="4.23">numbers are completely fake home</text>
  <text start="474.37" dur="4.62">ownership is down to nineteen seventy</text>
  <text start="476.38" dur="6.12">levels housing starts are back to</text>
  <text start="478.99" dur="5.1">nineteen ninety-one levels and the banks</text>
  <text start="482.5" dur="3.15">were instructed to keep houses off the</text>
  <text start="484.09" dur="5.329">market to increase the bubbles in</text>
  <text start="485.65" dur="8.34">certain cities so all those foreclosures</text>
  <text start="489.419" dur="6.851">do not put them on the market the Fed</text>
  <text start="493.99" dur="6.72">came in and is continually buying up</text>
  <text start="496.27" dur="6.75">toxic real estate so the high-end market</text>
  <text start="500.71" dur="5.55">right now is getting hit very hard a</text>
  <text start="503.02" dur="5.28">record of 95 homes for 2.5 million and</text>
  <text start="506.26" dur="4.02">above or on the market up forty-two</text>
  <text start="508.3" dur="5.82">percent from the prior year and they</text>
  <text start="510.28" dur="7.559">cannot move them a record 75 luxury</text>
  <text start="514.12" dur="5.159">condos are for sale and this is a</text>
  <text start="517.839" dur="5.791">forty-four percent increase and they</text>
  <text start="519.279" dur="6.18">cannot move them we&amp;#39;re seeing luxury</text>
  <text start="523.63" dur="5.78">home sales decline in the first five</text>
  <text start="525.459" dur="7.411">months of 2016 the first time since 2010</text>
  <text start="529.41" dur="5.14">this tells us that we have a major</text>
  <text start="532.87" dur="4.74">problem and yesterday I mentioned the</text>
  <text start="534.55" dur="5.37">Hamptons and when I look around the</text>
  <text start="537.61" dur="4.349">Northeast I look at the South I look at</text>
  <text start="539.92" dur="4.44">the Midwest the West we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="541.959" dur="3.721">see this spread quite a bit now actually</text>
  <text start="544.36" dur="2.76">many people are taking their houses off</text>
  <text start="545.68" dur="3.45">the market because they&amp;#39;ve been lowering</text>
  <text start="547.12" dur="3.75">at 10,000 another fifteen thousand</text>
  <text start="549.13" dur="3.06">another ten thousand and after a while</text>
  <text start="550.87" dur="3.99">what they do is they give up and they</text>
  <text start="552.19" dur="5.399">say you know something I&amp;#39;m done so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="554.86" dur="4.65">seeing retail contract housing is</text>
  <text start="557.589" dur="5.221">rapidly falling apart and remember this</text>
  <text start="559.51" dur="4.34">is the hot season for real estate no pun</text>
  <text start="562.81" dur="3.66">intended</text>
  <text start="563.85" dur="5.59">because people like to get into their</text>
  <text start="566.47" dur="6.24">new homes before school starts when the</text>
  <text start="569.44" dur="6.78">winter comes housing really declines</text>
  <text start="572.71" dur="6.48">quite a bit so we&amp;#39;re in the middle right</text>
  <text start="576.22" dur="4.679">now and we&amp;#39;re seeing major problems and</text>
  <text start="579.19" dur="6.209">as we go forward it&amp;#39;s just going to get</text>
  <text start="580.899" dur="6.931">worse now the IMF is continually out</text>
  <text start="585.399" dur="4.981">there making predictions and of course</text>
  <text start="587.83" dur="3.6">and during the brexit they said the</text>
  <text start="590.38" dur="3.14">whole thing is going to be falling apart</text>
  <text start="591.43" dur="3.96">doom and gloom our predictions that</text>
  <text start="593.52" dur="5.35">everything&amp;#39;s going to crash and of</text>
  <text start="595.39" dur="5.88">course we had the referendum and they</text>
  <text start="598.87" dur="4.83">kind of backtrack on that saying well</text>
  <text start="601.27" dur="4.8">maybe not so much it&amp;#39;s going to crash as</text>
  <text start="603.7" dur="4.139">much as we said and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="606.07" dur="3.78">doing this and their predictions are all</text>
  <text start="607.839" dur="4.881">over the place actually the IMF is</text>
  <text start="609.85" dur="5.31">losing their credibility at this point</text>
  <text start="612.72" dur="4.179">they&amp;#39;ve been seriously wronged for many</text>
  <text start="615.16" dur="4.17">years they start off with high</text>
  <text start="616.899" dur="5.25">predictions and they continually change</text>
  <text start="619.33" dur="4.199">them over time they start off with GDP</text>
  <text start="622.149" dur="3.361">at three percent and they go down to two</text>
  <text start="623.529" dur="3.451">point five and two percent then one</text>
  <text start="625.51" dur="4.17">point five percent depending on which</text>
  <text start="626.98" dur="7.07">country it is and they continually do</text>
  <text start="629.68" dur="9.75">this and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="634.05" dur="7.96">that the central bank&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="639.43" dur="5.67">trying to keep this system going the</text>
  <text start="642.01" dur="5.91">debt has reached a level where it cannot</text>
  <text start="645.1" dur="5.489">be sustained now they brought interest</text>
  <text start="647.92" dur="4.71">rates down to zero many places it&amp;#39;s gone</text>
  <text start="650.589" dur="4.351">negative think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="652.63" dur="5.7">why would you have to do that the only</text>
  <text start="654.94" dur="5.399">reason is to keep those payments very</text>
  <text start="658.33" dur="5.67">very low on the trillions and trillions</text>
  <text start="660.339" dur="7.561">worth of debt but there will come a time</text>
  <text start="664" dur="5.25">as the debt keeps piling up it won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="667.9" dur="3.3">matter what the interest rates are</text>
  <text start="669.25" dur="4.829">because the government&amp;#39;s will not be</text>
  <text start="671.2" dur="5.43">able to make the payments think about it</text>
  <text start="674.079" dur="3.781">if we&amp;#39;re turning into a part-time nation</text>
  <text start="676.63" dur="4.769">that the world is turning into a</text>
  <text start="677.86" dur="5.49">part-time world and Europe is decimated</text>
  <text start="681.399" dur="5.88">with unemployment I mean it&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="683.35" dur="7.77">awful where is the revenue going to come</text>
  <text start="687.279" dur="6.901">from and this is what they&amp;#39;re fighting</text>
