  <text start="289.04" dur="5.939">counting the layoffs they got rid of</text>
  <text start="291.89" dur="5.37">that department back in 2013 and as we</text>
  <text start="294.979" dur="8.331">move forward the</text>
  <text start="297.26" dur="9.62">situation today mimics 2008 with a twist</text>
  <text start="303.31" dur="7">where things are a lot worse for example</text>
  <text start="306.88" dur="7.03">food stamp beneficiaries they have</text>
  <text start="310.31" dur="8.1">exceeded 45 million for fifty six</text>
  <text start="313.91" dur="8.52">straight months in a row I mean that is</text>
  <text start="318.41" dur="8.31">a lot of people on food stamps for a</text>
  <text start="322.43" dur="6.83">very long time and this data was</text>
  <text start="326.72" dur="7.35">released by Department of Agriculture</text>
  <text start="329.26" dur="11.02">now as we move forward the government</text>
  <text start="334.07" dur="8.28">will continually try to collect taxes to</text>
  <text start="340.28" dur="6.03">bring in revenue why because take</text>
  <text start="342.35" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;re not bringing in enough so on the</text>
  <text start="346.31" dur="4.77">corporate media we see the US government</text>
  <text start="348.86" dur="5.57">has collected a record 1.2 trillion in</text>
  <text start="351.08" dur="8.46">taxes now remember they have Obamacare</text>
  <text start="354.43" dur="9.15">they have FATCA bringing in revenue</text>
  <text start="359.54" dur="6.48">without that there&amp;#39;d be no record number</text>
  <text start="363.58" dur="5.4">so they brought in one point two four</text>
  <text start="366.02" dur="5.58">eight trillion dollars worth of taxes</text>
  <text start="368.98" dur="6.52">for the first five months of the fiscal</text>
  <text start="371.6" dur="8.61">year of 2016 in the same five month</text>
  <text start="375.5" dur="8.82">period the government spent 1.6 billion</text>

  <text start="386.42" dur="9.87">total tax revenue we have a problem we</text>
  <text start="393.35" dur="5.1">have a major problem because where else</text>
  <text start="396.29" dur="6.3">are they going to get the additional</text>
  <text start="398.45" dur="8.67">revenue they&amp;#39;ve been taxing everything</text>
  <text start="402.59" dur="6.87">and the spending is increasing the debt</text>
  <text start="407.12" dur="6.11">on the country is increasing the</text>
  <text start="409.46" dur="8.43">interest payments will be increasing</text>
  <text start="413.23" dur="7.17">it&amp;#39;s not just going to disappear yes</text>
  <text start="417.89" dur="5.87">they&amp;#39;ll be able to cover it up and</text>
  <text start="420.4" dur="6.16">pretend that someone else caused it but</text>
  <text start="423.76" dur="6.85">we&amp;#39;re still going to go through the pain</text>
  <text start="426.56" dur="8.25">the pain of this collapse will not</text>
  <text start="430.61" dur="7.049">disappear and we see that there are many</text>
  <text start="434.81" dur="7.979">warning signs that this stock market is</text>
  <text start="437.659" dur="7.891">a complete illusion we see the decline</text>
