  <text start="170.459" dur="6.151">on Mays plan which is really the --use</text>
  <text start="173.19" dur="5.67">plan well today it seems like they</text>
  <text start="176.61" dur="4.02">changed their mind they said if the</text>
  <text start="178.86" dur="4.44">withdrawal agreement is not approved by</text>
  <text start="180.63" dur="4.859">the House of Commons next week the</text>

  <text start="207.78" dur="6.45">extension May is trying to figure out a</text>
  <text start="211.26" dur="6.36">way for the people to accept her plan</text>
  <text start="214.23" dur="7.56">and most likely we&amp;#39;re gonna end up with</text>
  <text start="217.62" dur="5.67">maybe a No Deal type of scenario we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="221.79" dur="2.419">have to wait and see but it seems like</text>
  <text start="223.29" dur="3.72">we might be heading in that direction</text>
  <text start="224.209" dur="5.321">now very interestingly we are starting</text>
  <text start="227.01" dur="3.66">to see the deep state they are now being</text>
  <text start="229.53" dur="3.42">exposed</text>
  <text start="230.67" dur="5.069">now remember they&amp;#39;ve been pushing</text>
  <text start="232.95" dur="5.25">climate change we know that has to do</text>
  <text start="235.739" dur="5.631">with taxing everyone on their carbon</text>
  <text start="238.2" dur="5.58">footprint taxing people maybe on rain</text>
  <text start="241.37" dur="5.89">taxing people anywhere they possibly can</text>
  <text start="243.78" dur="6.179">and making the people responsible for</text>
  <text start="247.26" dur="4.789">absolutely nothing well it looks like</text>
  <text start="249.959" dur="6.601">New Jersey is heading in that direction</text>
  <text start="252.049" dur="7.78">the New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy sign</text>
  <text start="256.56" dur="7.59">19 bills into law on Monday one of which</text>
  <text start="259.829" dur="6.661">was the rain tax now how does this work</text>
  <text start="264.15" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re gonna calculate how much rain</text>
  <text start="266.49" dur="5.07">runs off your property and you will be</text>
  <text start="268.83" dur="4.98">responsible for that rain water and</text>
  <text start="271.56" dur="4.32">you&amp;#39;ll be taxed on it do you really</text>
  <text start="273.81" dur="6.81">think that money is gonna go for you</text>
  <text start="275.88" dur="6.44">know the climate change agenda where do</text>
  <text start="280.62" dur="4.25">you think all this money&amp;#39;s gonna go to</text>
  <text start="282.32" dur="5.14">well no we&amp;#39;re good</text>
  <text start="284.87" dur="5.019">Assemblyman Christopher de Philips has</text>
  <text start="287.46" dur="4.17">said the rain Tenex bill permits local</text>
  <text start="289.889" dur="4.201">communities to tax based on weather and</text>
  <text start="291.63" dur="4.14">allows unlimited bonding and debt to be</text>
  <text start="294.09" dur="3.96">placed on the backs of property tax</text>
  <text start="295.77" dur="4.56">payers not that bond</text>
  <text start="298.05" dur="5.489">and debt aren&amp;#39;t already on the backs of</text>
  <text start="300.33" dur="5.399">taxpayers it is but now New Jersey gets</text>
  <text start="303.539" dur="4.53">to carry the financial burden when it</text>
  <text start="305.729" dur="5.19">rains the last thing this state needs is</text>
  <text start="308.069" dur="4.231">more debt and another runaway tax</text>
  <text start="310.919" dur="5.131">because you know what happens next</text>
  <text start="312.3" dur="6.75">they place a tax on the tax and before</text>
  <text start="316.05" dur="7.679">you know it everything is taxed so here</text>
  <text start="319.05" dur="8.04">we are today and they&amp;#39;re now taxing rain</text>
  <text start="323.729" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re taxing the weather which nobody</text>
  <text start="327.09" dur="3.389">has any control oh and this is not the</text>
  <text start="328.889" dur="3.541">only area where the deep state is being</text>
  <text start="330.479" dur="4.56">exposed and we&amp;#39;ll be talking about that</text>
  <text start="332.43" dur="5.97">in just a bit in the next report but</text>
  <text start="335.039" dur="5.22">first we&amp;#39;re seeing existing home sales</text>
  <text start="338.4" dur="3.299">they&amp;#39;ve been declining for a very long</text>
  <text start="340.259" dur="4.291">time and the news is out there and</text>
  <text start="341.699" dur="5.84">they&amp;#39;re saying that home sales soar in</text>
  <text start="344.55" dur="6.54">February these are existing home sales</text>
  <text start="347.539" dur="4.93">now you really need to look at these</text>
  <text start="351.09" dur="4.079">numbers they&amp;#39;re saying existing home</text>
  <text start="352.469" dur="7.111">sales soared in February it&amp;#39;s up 11.8%</text>
  <text start="355.169" dur="8.55">month-on-month most since 2015 but when</text>
  <text start="359.58" dur="7.55">you really dive down deep and you look</text>
  <text start="363.719" dur="7.56">at this you see that well on a</text>
  <text start="367.13" dur="6.969">year-over-year basis a six existing home</text>
  <text start="371.279" dur="5.461">sales were down for the 12th month in a</text>
  <text start="374.099" dur="5.671">row right now home sales in the negative</text>
  <text start="376.74" dur="6.299">territory it&amp;#39;s barely getting up to the</text>
  <text start="379.77" dur="6.329">zero percent mark which tells you</text>
  <text start="383.039" dur="6.391">something home sales are not soaring</text>
  <text start="386.099" dur="6.57">actually Redfin put together a monthly</text>
  <text start="389.43" dur="6.18">home sales report contains a lot of data</text>
  <text start="392.669" dur="5.22">and the chart shows February of 2018</text>
  <text start="395.61" dur="5.16">year-over-year price growth and when you</text>
  <text start="397.889" dur="7.83">look at it you can see that price growth</text>
  <text start="400.77" dur="8.73">is way way down sales are way way down</text>
  <text start="405.719" dur="6.021">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="409.5" dur="4.62">the real estate market is imploding now</text>
  <text start="411.74" dur="5.32">Trump the Patriots what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="414.12" dur="4.769">to do is they&amp;#39;re trying to stabilize the</text>
  <text start="417.06" dur="3.27">people&amp;#39;s economy and I separate the</text>
  <text start="418.889" dur="4.441">economy on purpose because we have a</text>
  <text start="420.33" dur="4.739">statistical economy where the government</text>
  <text start="423.33" dur="4.769">can manipulate the numbers like the</text>
  <text start="425.069" dur="5.22">stock market GDP unemployment we have</text>
  <text start="428.099" dur="3.421">the real people&amp;#39;s economy where this is</text>
  <text start="430.289" dur="3.301">based on retail</text>
  <text start="431.52" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s based on housing sales car sales</text>
  <text start="433.59" dur="5.46">and things like that and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="435.96" dur="6.03">seeing right now is that Trump is trying</text>
  <text start="439.05" dur="4.589">to stabilize the people&amp;#39;s economy now</text>
  <text start="441.99" dur="3.72">remember this is all a central bank</text>
  <text start="443.639" dur="5.25">economy all of this is wrapped up into</text>
  <text start="445.71" dur="4.38">one but the people&amp;#39;s economy they need</text>
  <text start="448.889" dur="2.4">the stabilizer because if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="450.09" dur="3.66">stabilize it</text>
  <text start="451.289" dur="5.1">it will implode on itself and everything</text>
  <text start="453.75" dur="3.75">will just go down and Trump the Patriots</text>
  <text start="456.389" dur="2.701">they don&amp;#39;t want this to happen because</text>
  <text start="457.5" dur="3.63">they know that 2020 elections are coming</text>
  <text start="459.09" dur="5.009">up and they need to keep everything</text>
  <text start="461.13" dur="6.569">stable because they need to push their</text>
  <text start="464.099" dur="6.181">plan and they need to make sure they</text>
  <text start="467.699" dur="5.34">have everything in place so what are</text>
  <text start="470.28" dur="5.129">they doing they are broadcasting out to</text>
  <text start="473.039" dur="4.261">everyone that the economy is doing great</text>
  <text start="475.409" dur="5.07">this way the mainstream media the new</text>
  <text start="477.3" dur="5.28">candidates and the people of America and</text>
  <text start="480.479" dur="5.91">people around the world think that</text>
  <text start="482.58" dur="5.459">America is doing fantastically and later</text>
  <text start="486.389" dur="2.971">on what he&amp;#39;s going to do he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="488.039" dur="2.28">blame this on the Fed we&amp;#39;ll get into</text>
