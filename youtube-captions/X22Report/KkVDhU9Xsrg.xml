  <text start="51.57" dur="5.129">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="53.01" dur="6.779">episode 1269 a and today&amp;#39;s date is May</text>
  <text start="56.699" dur="4.981">2nd 2017 and the title of the episode is</text>
  <text start="59.789" dur="5.401">as the date of the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="61.68" dur="6.78">just been leaked let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="65.19" dur="5.34">economic collapse financial news now as</text>
  <text start="68.46" dur="4.71">we know up in Toronto Vancouver</text>
  <text start="70.53" dur="4.619">there are huge real estate bubbles that</text>
  <text start="73.17" dur="4.83">are getting ready to pump and we also</text>
  <text start="75.149" dur="5.28">understand at home Capital Group well we</text>
  <text start="78" dur="5.369">know they are in big trouble we know</text>
  <text start="80.429" dur="5.25">that there&amp;#39;s a lot of money leaving this</text>
  <text start="83.369" dur="5.371">Bank and people are taking their money</text>
  <text start="85.679" dur="6.08">out of the system and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="88.74" dur="6.59">right now is that this might spread to</text>
  <text start="91.759" dur="6.821">another Canadian mortgage lender and</text>
  <text start="95.33" dur="5.739">again these things are never isolated</text>
  <text start="98.58" dur="4.95">even though they continually tell us</text>
  <text start="101.069" dur="5.431">that these things are isolated it never</text>
  <text start="103.53" dur="5.039">seems to be isolated in one area it</text>
  <text start="106.5" dur="5.1">seems that something is always connected</text>
  <text start="108.569" dur="5.28">to someplace else and so on and so on</text>
  <text start="111.6" dur="4.769">and before you know it there are many</text>
  <text start="113.849" dur="4.561">different mortgage lender banks that are</text>
  <text start="116.369" dur="5.851">affected by what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="118.41" dur="6.659">and red flags were being waved and they</text>
  <text start="122.22" dur="6.72">were very worried about the possible</text>
  <text start="125.069" dur="5.431">contagion hitting Canadians equitable</text>
  <text start="128.94" dur="5.61">group this is another alternative</text>
  <text start="130.5" dur="6.629">mortgage lender and it starts started to</text>
  <text start="134.55" dur="5.34">see an elevated but manageable decrease</text>
  <text start="137.129" dur="5.161">in deposit balances now the company said</text>
  <text start="139.89" dur="5.28">that the customers have withdrawn an</text>
  <text start="142.29" dur="6.75">average of 75 million each day between</text>
  <text start="145.17" dur="6.27">Wednesday and Friday and when we look at</text>
  <text start="149.04" dur="5.19">this situation we need to understand</text>
  <text start="151.44" dur="5.64">that this is how it all begins now they</text>
  <text start="154.23" dur="4.649">might be able to stop this they we know</text>
  <text start="157.08" dur="4.32">there&amp;#39;s a bailout we know that other</text>
  <text start="158.879" dur="5.011">things are happening right now and they</text>
  <text start="161.4" dur="6.18">might contain this for a short period of</text>
  <text start="163.89" dur="6.629">time but as we know these things never</text>
  <text start="167.58" dur="5.42">stay contained we also know there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="170.519" dur="5.521">housing bubble in Toronto Vancouver</text>
  <text start="173" dur="5.59">throughout the United States and in</text>
  <text start="176.04" dur="5.83">other areas around the world and we know</text>
  <text start="178.59" dur="5.89">once one pops well it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="181.87" dur="4.949">to spread rapidly throughout each</text>
  <text start="184.48" dur="5.369">country and we&amp;#39;ve seen this before this</text>
  <text start="186.819" dur="6.211">is nothing new and we can see that we</text>
  <text start="189.849" dur="5.67">all need to understand and realize that</text>
  <text start="193.03" dur="6.569">this whole thing can go at any moment</text>
  <text start="195.519" dur="7.14">now in Greece it looks like Greece made</text>
  <text start="199.599" dur="5.341">a deal with their lenders and they</text>
  <text start="202.659" dur="6.571">promised even more austerity now Athens</text>
  <text start="204.94" dur="6.45">promised to cut pensions in 2019 and we</text>
  <text start="209.23" dur="4.08">know that it always comes back to the</text>
  <text start="211.39" dur="4.89">people and we know what the central</text>
  <text start="213.31" dur="6.69">banks want they want the real assets of</text>
  <text start="216.28" dur="7.26">the country so what did Greece promise</text>
  <text start="220" dur="7.62">well they promised more austerity they</text>
  <text start="223.54" dur="7.89">also promised to sell coal-fired plants</text>
  <text start="227.62" dur="6.539">and coal mines equal to about 40% of its</text>
  <text start="231.43" dur="5.369">dominant power utility Public Power Corp</text>
  <text start="234.159" dur="6.061">capacity so basically the central</text>
  <text start="236.799" dur="7.321">bankers have come in and they&amp;#39;re buying</text>
  <text start="240.22" dur="6.359">real assets from the country on pennies</text>
  <text start="244.12" dur="5.64">on the dollar and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="246.579" dur="4.621">that the people might not just be</text>
  <text start="249.76" dur="3.839">sitting down for this they might</text>
  <text start="251.2" dur="4.59">eventually give when you push them far</text>
  <text start="253.599" dur="3.661">enough against the wall and you keep</text>
  <text start="255.79" dur="3.689">pushing them and pushing them and</text>
  <text start="257.26" dur="6.48">pushing them and taking things away</text>
  <text start="259.479" dur="7.981">eventually there is a revolt and the</text>
  <text start="263.74" dur="5.79">Greek people they&amp;#39;ve been hit hard over</text>
  <text start="267.46" dur="5.459">the many many years and with more</text>
  <text start="269.53" dur="6.48">austerity imposed on them on them well</text>
  <text start="272.919" dur="6.571">the current government they should be</text>
  <text start="276.01" dur="6.06">worried because we don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="279.49" dur="6.12">going to happen because as we can see</text>
  <text start="282.07" dur="6.719">everything the central bankers have done</text>
  <text start="285.61" dur="5.76">for Greece has not helped at all this</text>
  <text start="288.789" dur="5.88">has been going on for years and years</text>
  <text start="291.37" dur="5.9">and years like seven years now actually</text>
  <text start="294.669" dur="5.641">longer about eight to nine years and</text>
  <text start="297.27" dur="5.05">every time they tell us it&amp;#39;s better they</text>
  <text start="300.31" dur="4.32">need more austerity they need to sell</text>
  <text start="302.32" dur="3.84">more assets off from the country and it</text>
  <text start="304.63" dur="5.099">just gets worse for the people not</text>
  <text start="306.16" dur="6.66">better here in the United States well we</text>
  <text start="309.729" dur="6.19">see something happening in the subprime</text>
  <text start="312.82" dur="6.159">market of the auto industry</text>
  <text start="315.919" dur="5.31">and we know that stocks have never been</text>
  <text start="318.979" dur="6.72">more overvalued than they are today</text>
  <text start="321.229" dur="9.21">and we see that something is lurking in</text>
  <text start="325.699" dur="7.28">the subprime auto lending arena auto</text>
  <text start="330.439" dur="6.241">loan generation has gone absolutely</text>
  <text start="332.979" dur="6.791">vertical since 2009 rising an incredible</text>
  <text start="336.68" dur="5.16">56 percent in seven years even more</text>
  <text start="339.77" dur="6.419">incredibly roughly one third of those</text>
  <text start="341.84" dur="5.46">loans their subprime their garbage so in</text>
  <text start="346.189" dur="6.421">the simplest terms</text>
  <text start="347.3" dur="8.94">this is subprime 2.0 and the fuse well</text>
  <text start="352.61" dur="6.929">it has been lit there is a one point two</text>
  <text start="356.24" dur="6.06">trillion debt bomb here and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="359.539" dur="5.011">watching this for quite a while and we</text>
  <text start="362.3" dur="5.94">can see that there&amp;#39;s going to be major</text>
  <text start="364.55" dur="6.479">problems now we just got a red flag to</text>
  <text start="368.24" dur="4.38">tell us that something has gone wrong</text>
  <text start="371.029" dur="4.11">because auto sales</text>
  <text start="372.62" dur="6.569">they have peaked and are now rolling</text>
  <text start="375.139" dur="6.421">over so when we look at this we can see</text>
  <text start="379.189" dur="4.561">that we&amp;#39;re starting to see a repeat of</text>
  <text start="381.56" dur="4.889">what happened in late 2007 right before</text>
  <text start="383.75" dur="3.96">the economy fell off a cliff and the</text>
  <text start="386.449" dur="3.78">stock market crashed</text>
  <text start="387.71" dur="4.139">so which what it means is is that</text>
  <text start="390.229" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re not going to be able to lend</text>
  <text start="391.849" dur="6">much more out there and this is the</text>
  <text start="394.909" dur="5.461">signal that we&amp;#39;ve been looking for when</text>
  <text start="397.849" dur="6.511">auto sales rollover it shows that</text>
  <text start="400.37" dur="5.549">consumer is tapped out so the fact that</text>
  <text start="404.36" dur="3.35">this is happening at a time when auto</text>
  <text start="405.919" dur="4.23">lenders are making subprime loans and</text>
  <text start="407.71" dur="4.15">people aren&amp;#39;t buying even when the offer</text>
  <text start="410.149" dur="4.77">is ridiculous and they&amp;#39;re giving all</text>
  <text start="411.86" dur="6.329">these incentives means this industry has</text>
  <text start="414.919" dur="4.77">turned it&amp;#39;s now just a matter of months</text>
  <text start="418.189" dur="3.03">before the defaults start hitting and</text>
  <text start="419.689" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;re already starting to see the</text>
  <text start="421.219" dur="4.891">delinquencies and when were when we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="423.889" dur="4.351">looking at this we see there&amp;#39;s about a</text>
  <text start="426.11" dur="5.01">hundred and twenty billion in garbage</text>
  <text start="428.24" dur="5.19">loans out there and this could very well</text>
  <text start="431.12" dur="6.81">be the needle that burst a Fed fueled</text>
  <text start="433.43" dur="5.669">sixty trillion dollar debt bubble and we</text>
  <text start="437.93" dur="4.259">need to watch this very carefully</text>
  <text start="439.099" dur="3.93">because this could all come down with a</text>
  <text start="442.189" dur="3.9">snap of a finger</text>
  <text start="443.029" dur="5.461">now JPMorgan Chase they are out there</text>
  <text start="446.089" dur="3.721">saying that they are seeing different</text>
  <text start="448.49" dur="2.91">red flags</text>
  <text start="449.81" dur="3">and this is why they&amp;#39;re starting to sell</text>
  <text start="451.4" dur="4.23">their stocks and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="452.81" dur="5.76">that the retail investor is stepping in</text>
  <text start="455.63" dur="6.3">and they are buying stocks like crazy</text>
  <text start="458.57" dur="8.52">the insiders they are selling the stocks</text>
  <text start="461.93" dur="8.22">like crazy this is a scenario that there</text>
  <text start="467.09" dur="5.61">is a huge bubble going on right now and</text>
  <text start="470.15" dur="3.989">this is the top of the bubble and this</text>
  <text start="472.7" dur="4.439">is how it all ends</text>
  <text start="474.139" dur="5.581">because once the insiders finish selling</text>
  <text start="477.139" dur="5.971">what they need to sell that&amp;#39;s when they</text>
  <text start="479.72" dur="6.48">crash the system and JP Morgan is saying</text>
  <text start="483.11" dur="5.22">the risk reward is worsening so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="486.2" dur="4.439">looking at the Citigroup economic</text>
  <text start="488.33" dur="4.559">surprise index and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="490.639" dur="3.931">has rolled over sharply now the</text>
  <text start="492.889" dur="4.441">Citigroup economic surprises in Dex</text>
  <text start="494.57" dur="6.3">rolled over sharply recently and is now</text>
  <text start="497.33" dur="5.85">in the negative territory and the other</text>
  <text start="500.87" dur="5.7">times they&amp;#39;ve seen this this is when</text>
  <text start="503.18" dur="5.91">we&amp;#39;ve gone into a recession they see the</text>
  <text start="506.57" dur="5.25">impact of the Chinese stimulus well that</text>
  <text start="509.09" dur="5.999">is fading this is seen in the sharp</text>
  <text start="511.82" dur="5.58">decline in new project starts seasonals</text>
  <text start="515.089" dur="3.991">are now turning negative April was</text>
  <text start="517.4" dur="4.5">typically the best month in Europe but</text>
  <text start="519.08" dur="6.03">from May onwards the returns tended to</text>
  <text start="521.9" dur="6.12">be poor summer seasonality was typically</text>
  <text start="525.11" dur="4.38">negative equities posted below average</text>
  <text start="528.02" dur="4.49">negative returns on most occasions</text>
  <text start="529.49" dur="6">during the May September period</text>
  <text start="532.51" dur="5.07">commodity prices right now are weaker</text>
  <text start="535.49" dur="4.43">which hurts the reflation trade</text>
  <text start="537.58" dur="6.52">inflation forwards have rolled over</text>
  <text start="539.92" dur="8.11">Chinese PPI is likely peaking and Italy</text>
  <text start="544.1" dur="5.61">could be the next curveball so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="548.03" dur="3.96">getting out of stocks because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="549.71" dur="4.92">very very worried with what is coming</text>
  <text start="551.99" dur="5.34">and normally these insiders they know</text>
  <text start="554.63" dur="5.52">exactly what is happening now Trump is</text>
  <text start="557.33" dur="5.19">preparing to replace the top banking</text>
  <text start="560.15" dur="5.07">regulator and yesterday you have to</text>
  <text start="562.52" dur="4.77">remember he basically blurted out you</text>
  <text start="565.22" dur="3.51">know maybe we should break up the big</text>
  <text start="567.29" dur="3.84">banks and he was referring to</text>
  <text start="568.73" dur="4.71">glass-steagall and we have to remember</text>
  <text start="571.13" dur="4.74">glass-steagall really kept the banks</text>
  <text start="573.44" dur="5.34">separated from risky investments from</text>
  <text start="575.87" dur="5.07">the people&amp;#39;s deposits and we can see</text>
  <text start="578.78" dur="4.17">right now that he wants to go back to</text>
  <text start="580.94" dur="3.199">that type of model and actually break up</text>
  <text start="582.95" dur="4.579">the big</text>
  <text start="584.139" dur="5.851">that are manipulating along with the</text>
  <text start="587.529" dur="6.18">central bank everything that we see in</text>
  <text start="589.99" dur="7.829">the economy right now and his first move</text>
  <text start="593.709" dur="6">is to get a new banking regulator now</text>
  <text start="597.819" dur="5.31">who is he going to pick we don&amp;#39;t know as</text>
  <text start="599.709" dur="7.68">of yet but he&amp;#39;s looking at maybe mr.</text>
  <text start="603.129" dur="7.14">Norika and he basically volunteered his</text>
  <text start="607.389" dur="5.88">time when he was on the Trump when he</text>
  <text start="610.269" dur="6.271">was on Trump&amp;#39;s transition team and he</text>
  <text start="613.269" dur="6.63">worked as the treasurer at that point in</text>
  <text start="616.54" dur="5.25">time so there are rumors about that but</text>
  <text start="619.899" dur="5.281">we don&amp;#39;t know where he&amp;#39;s going with this</text>
  <text start="621.79" dur="7.14">as of yet now Trump blurted out</text>
  <text start="625.18" dur="7.409">something else today where he said we</text>
  <text start="628.93" dur="5.639">need a good shutdown in September to fix</text>
  <text start="632.589" dur="3.721">this mess now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="634.569" dur="3">about all of this and all these</text>
  <text start="636.31" dur="3.149">different things that he&amp;#39;s saying right</text>
  <text start="637.569" dur="3.361">now where he&amp;#39;s saying that maybe we</text>
  <text start="639.459" dur="3.091">should break up the banking system he</text>
  <text start="640.93" dur="4.74">has Andrew Jackson hanging on the wall</text>
  <text start="642.55" dur="5.7">inside the Oval Office where he broke up</text>
  <text start="645.67" dur="5.729">the central banking system we also</text>
  <text start="648.25" dur="6.149">understand that he is trying to bring</text>
  <text start="651.399" dur="5.071">down the economy where he wants more</text>
  <text start="654.399" dur="4.261">spending he wants to blow up more of</text>
  <text start="656.47" dur="4.859">these bubbles so he&amp;#39;s able to bring the</text>
  <text start="658.66" dur="4.739">system down to show everyone that under</text>
  <text start="661.329" dur="4.26">this system that we have right now it</text>
  <text start="663.399" dur="4.351">cannot last if you notice when he first</text>
  <text start="665.589" dur="5.25">came into the White House he started to</text>
  <text start="667.75" dur="5.309">cut things and he started to uh you know</text>
  <text start="670.839" dur="4.831">work the budget a little bit and then</text>
  <text start="673.059" dur="5.64">all of a sudden he just stopped and he</text>
  <text start="675.67" dur="5.7">basically went in a completely different</text>
  <text start="678.699" dur="5.461">direction and then he started out with</text>
  <text start="681.37" dur="7.709">all these different reviews review of</text>
  <text start="684.16" dur="7.799">the land where Obama Bush Clinton put</text>
  <text start="689.079" dur="6.031">the land as collateral for the debt that</text>
  <text start="691.959" dur="6.11">we have right now he started to review</text>
  <text start="695.11" dur="5.699">the federal overreach into education and</text>
  <text start="698.069" dur="4.601">he started to sign different executive</text>
  <text start="700.809" dur="3.991">orders dismantling a lot of the things</text>
  <text start="702.67" dur="3.659">that Obama has done and there&amp;#39;s just so</text>
  <text start="704.8" dur="4.019">many things you can do with with an</text>
  <text start="706.329" dur="4.141">executive order and all of this</text>
  <text start="708.819" dur="3.57">everything that he&amp;#39;s been doing right</text>

  <text start="714.37" dur="6.5">preparation for the collapse</text>
  <text start="716.94" dur="6.11">the system and the question is is he</text>
  <text start="720.87" dur="5">trying to tell everyone that listen</text>
  <text start="723.05" dur="5.62">during this timeframe September October</text>
  <text start="725.87" dur="5.77">this is when most likely the system will</text>
  <text start="728.67" dur="6.14">come down do I know this for sure no we</text>
  <text start="731.64" dur="6.71">know that they approved a spending</text>

  <text start="759.96" dur="6.87">getting ready and preparing for this</text>

  <text start="777.6" dur="4.68">complete mess in his mind maybe he</text>
  <text start="779.94" dur="4.38">thought he could fix it but with the</text>

  <text start="939.77" dur="5.31">20s 30s to 40s many people how to do it</text>
  <text start="943.19" dur="4.62">on their own there were no real</text>
  <text start="945.08" dur="5.88">government handouts there were a few but</text>
  <text start="947.81" dur="5.91">we all had to do things to make to get</text>
  <text start="950.96" dur="5.4">by there was no one to depend on there</text>
  <text start="953.72" dur="4.92">was no government and when we go through</text>
