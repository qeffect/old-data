  <text start="57.78" dur="6.029">getting worse and worse the people are</text>
  <text start="60.629" dur="5.641">definitely paying the price here and we</text>
  <text start="63.809" dur="6.751">hear nothing from the government we hear</text>
  <text start="66.27" dur="7.61">nothing from Congress we here absolutely</text>
  <text start="70.56" dur="8.01">nothing it&amp;#39;s like crickets and we know</text>
  <text start="73.88" dur="8.409">13 exchanges have already defaulted and</text>
  <text start="78.57" dur="7.79">closed and we see at this point that</text>
  <text start="82.289" dur="7.411">there are more than 92,000 people in</text>
  <text start="86.36" dur="5.11">Colorado that are going to be losing</text>
  <text start="89.7" dur="5.46">their obamacare health care coverage in</text>

  <text start="127.289" dur="7.17">still a disaster and it is getting worse</text>
  <text start="129.539" dur="7.591">and at this point I think the people of</text>
  <text start="134.459" dur="5.191">the United States should stand up and</text>
  <text start="137.13" dur="4.89">say okay we&amp;#39;ve had enough of this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="139.65" dur="6">time to get rid of this let&amp;#39;s get rid of</text>

  <text start="150.36" dur="5.67">there going this doesn&amp;#39;t work it&amp;#39;s time</text>
  <text start="152.94" dur="5.58">to remove it we need to go back or do</text>
  <text start="156.03" dur="5.52">something completely different but of</text>
  <text start="158.52" dur="4.77">course we&amp;#39;re not hearing much and i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="161.55" dur="2.31">not talking about oh you know what I</text>
  <text start="163.29" dur="1.95">have a</text>
  <text start="163.86" dur="2.64">better plan and let&amp;#39;s go with this plan</text>
  <text start="165.24" dur="4.2">which is pretty much the same thing but</text>
  <text start="166.5" dur="5.64">wrapped up in a different package and as</text>
  <text start="169.44" dur="7.77">we know as Obamacare started this was</text>
  <text start="172.14" dur="7.77">never a benefit to the people and we</text>
  <text start="177.21" dur="6.93">continually get proof of this every</text>
  <text start="179.91" dur="7.17">single day now there were some leaked</text>
  <text start="184.14" dur="6.18">documents about the British police</text>
  <text start="187.08" dur="6.84">teaching Saudi officers high-tech crime</text>
  <text start="190.32" dur="6.54">detection techniques that might lead to</text>
  <text start="193.92" dur="6.14">torture and execution and this is coming</text>
  <text start="196.86" dur="5.55">from activists Human Rights charities</text>
  <text start="200.06" dur="4.03">they&amp;#39;re saying that internal police</text>

  <text start="215.79" dur="6.18">college bosses recognized there was a</text>
  <text start="218.67" dur="5.4">risk the skills being trained are used</text>
  <text start="221.97" dur="5.28">to identify individuals who later go on</text>
  <text start="224.07" dur="5.58">to be tortured or subjected to other</text>
  <text start="227.25" dur="4.53">human rights abuses and we start to</text>
  <text start="229.65" dur="4.589">realize that many of the private was</text>
  <text start="231.78" dur="6.72">central bank countries they&amp;#39;re involved</text>
  <text start="234.239" dur="6.06">in this type of activity where they have</text>
  <text start="238.5" dur="3.959">these countries or they have a country</text>
  <text start="240.299" dur="5.791">where they have regime change and they</text>
  <text start="242.459" dur="7.351">use torture as a device to keep the</text>
  <text start="246.09" dur="5.64">people in line and we know that the</text>
  <text start="249.81" dur="3.57">United States has many different areas</text>
  <text start="251.73" dur="5.46">around the world where they have secret</text>
  <text start="253.38" dur="6.59">areas where they hold people of course</text>
  <text start="257.19" dur="7.86">they&amp;#39;re guilty until proven innocent</text>
  <text start="259.97" dur="7.03">they torture them and it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="265.05" dur="4.56">outside of the US and we know it</text>
  <text start="267" dur="5.49">happened in Chicago and there&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="269.61" dur="5.27">other areas inside the united states</text>
  <text start="272.49" dur="6.81">that we just haven&amp;#39;t found out about yet</text>
  <text start="274.88" dur="8.41">now something very interesting about the</text>
  <text start="279.3" dur="7.49">sanctions with Russia the American</text>
  <text start="283.29" dur="7.74">government is pushing for more sanctions</text>
  <text start="286.79" dur="7.27">against Russia and what is happening</text>
  <text start="291.03" dur="5.49">here is the US wants to extend the</text>
  <text start="294.06" dur="3.509">sanctions and add a couple of more and</text>
  <text start="296.52" dur="3.179">then</text>
  <text start="297.569" dur="4.74">we have assistant secretary Bureau of</text>
  <text start="299.699" dur="5.25">European and Eurasian affairs Victoria</text>
  <text start="302.309" dur="6.15">Nuland she is at the Senate Foreign</text>
  <text start="304.949" dur="7.59">Relations Committee and trying to</text>
  <text start="308.459" dur="7.68">convince countries that we need these</text>
  <text start="312.539" dur="6.87">sanctions we need to band together we</text>
  <text start="316.139" dur="6.78">need to add some more and very</text>
  <text start="319.409" dur="6.451">interestingly in France the French</text>
  <text start="322.919" dur="5.881">Senate has voted in favor of a</text>
  <text start="325.86" dur="5.82">resolution designed to lift EU imposed</text>
  <text start="328.8" dur="8.009">sanctions which they placed on Russia</text>
  <text start="331.68" dur="9.359">back in 2014 and the proposal calls for</text>
  <text start="336.809" dur="7.56">a gradual relief and there there was a</text>
  <text start="341.039" dur="8.4">huge majority of senators 302 voted for</text>
  <text start="344.369" dur="8.94">the move and 16 were against it now the</text>
  <text start="349.439" dur="6.301">u.s. is going to dispatch an envoy which</text>
  <text start="353.309" dur="6.15">I believe they already did to keep the</text>
  <text start="355.74" dur="7.5">EU in line and keep them together on</text>
  <text start="359.459" dur="8.1">Russian sanctions so when we look at</text>
  <text start="363.24" dur="9.389">this situation right now France might be</text>
  <text start="367.559" dur="6.81">a target for another terror attack it</text>
  <text start="372.629" dur="4.38">goes right now they want to lift the</text>
  <text start="374.369" dur="5.22">sanctions on Russia we know that the</text>
  <text start="377.009" dur="5.101">u.s. cannot have this they cannot have</text>
  <text start="379.589" dur="5.67">the rest of the EU countries say okay</text>
  <text start="382.11" dur="6.089">let&amp;#39;s join in with France and remove the</text>
  <text start="385.259" dur="8.36">sanctions on Russia this would destroy</text>
  <text start="388.199" dur="10.05">their plan so we&amp;#39;ve been hearing all</text>
  <text start="393.619" dur="9.61">this information about terrorism how not</text>
  <text start="398.249" dur="7.98">to travel in Europe and we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="403.229" dur="7.23">to get a clear picture of what is going</text>
  <text start="406.229" dur="7.321">on here because of what is happening in</text>
  <text start="410.459" dur="4.86">the EU because of France saying listen</text>
  <text start="413.55" dur="5.459">we don&amp;#39;t want these sanctions it is</text>
  <text start="415.319" dur="8.49">hurting our economy France at this point</text>
  <text start="419.009" dur="7.65">might be a prime target for the next</text>
  <text start="423.809" dur="6.72">terror attack and we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="426.659" dur="7.26">watch this situation very very closely</text>
  <text start="430.529" dur="6.02">now a US State Department official which</text>
  <text start="433.919" dur="4.77">this person does not want to be named</text>
  <text start="436.549" dur="4.21">they are out there saying that North</text>
  <text start="438.689" dur="6.65">Korea has restarted production of</text>
  <text start="440.759" dur="7.92">plutonium fuel they&amp;#39;ve went in and they</text>
  <text start="445.339" dur="7.21">restarted their production of nuclear</text>
  <text start="448.679" dur="7.98">bombs and the proof they have is we</text>
  <text start="452.549" dur="6.36">suspect this that&amp;#39;s the proof they have</text>
  <text start="456.659" dur="4.56">no other proof whatsoever they just</text>
  <text start="458.909" dur="3.96">think this is what North Korea is doing</text>
  <text start="461.219" dur="3.3">now this is all part of the propaganda</text>
  <text start="462.869" dur="4.29">because they want everyone to believe</text>
  <text start="464.519" dur="4.5">that North Korea is going to be the</text>
  <text start="467.159" dur="5.13">loose cannon now they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="469.019" dur="5.31">north korea into becoming the the loose</text>
  <text start="472.289" dur="5.04">cannon where they can say look look what</text>
  <text start="474.329" dur="5.16">they just did we need to go to war now</text>
  <text start="477.329" dur="4.32">it doesn&amp;#39;t mean this is the only country</text>
  <text start="479.489" dur="5.58">they are trying this with because all</text>
  <text start="481.649" dur="7.77">the players are the same we see that the</text>
  <text start="485.069" dur="6.57">u.s. is deliberately provoking China now</text>
  <text start="489.419" dur="5.46">we had another incidents the US Air</text>
  <text start="491.639" dur="5.61">Force rc-135 reconnaissance plane was</text>
  <text start="494.879" dur="5.49">again intercepted by two Chinese j10</text>
  <text start="497.249" dur="6.361">fighter planes during a routine patrol</text>
  <text start="500.369" dur="7.32">in international airspace very close to</text>
  <text start="503.61" dur="6.299">the border of China now the u.s. is out</text>
  <text start="507.689" dur="6">there saying that the intercept was done</text>
  <text start="509.909" dur="6.87">in an unsafe manner and China is saying</text>
  <text start="513.689" dur="6.301">absolutely not this is not true</text>
  <text start="516.779" dur="6.93">whatsoever the u.s. is using this to</text>
  <text start="519.99" dur="5.699">hype up the situation which I kind of</text>
  <text start="523.709" dur="6.271">agree because we&amp;#39;ve seen this before</text>
  <text start="525.689" dur="7.2">where the u.s. takes their spy planes or</text>
  <text start="529.98" dur="6.419">their ships and they bring them into an</text>
  <text start="532.889" dur="7.44">area where they know the country is</text>
  <text start="536.399" dur="6.12">going to send up their jets and send</text>
  <text start="540.329" dur="5.75">them over to see what&amp;#39;s going on just</text>
  <text start="542.519" dur="7.44">like if China was flying a spy plane</text>
  <text start="546.079" dur="7.68">ride on the East Coast where New York is</text>
  <text start="549.959" dur="7.17">where Virginia is where Washington DC is</text>
  <text start="553.759" dur="5.64">what would happen the US would send up</text>
  <text start="557.129" dur="4.89">fighter jets fighter jets</text>
  <text start="559.399" dur="4.86">instantaneously they would intercept</text>
  <text start="562.019" dur="7.23">what is going on here</text>
  <text start="564.259" dur="6.52">well the US is doing this to each and</text>
  <text start="569.249" dur="3.361">every one of these countries to try to</text>
  <text start="570.779" dur="4.831">provoke them into doing something and</text>
  <text start="572.61" dur="5.789">trying to build their story over time to</text>
  <text start="575.61" dur="5.25">convince the people that these countries</text>
  <text start="578.399" dur="4.17">are going to be the enemies of the</text>
  <text start="580.86" dur="6.12">United States because they need this</text>
  <text start="582.569" dur="7.56">when we go to war now the UK media had a</text>
  <text start="586.98" dur="6.779">very interesting story all over the</text>
  <text start="590.129" dur="8.25">place where they held the Royal Navy and</text>
  <text start="593.759" dur="6.841">NATO about tracking and intercepting a</text>
  <text start="598.379" dur="5.971">Russian submarine off the coast of the</text>
  <text start="600.6" dur="8.089">UK and the news created a lot of stir in</text>
  <text start="604.35" dur="7.019">the UK and they had headlines like</text>
  <text start="608.689" dur="5.95">Vladimir Putin sends attack submarine</text>
  <text start="611.369" dur="6.03">into English Channel the Daily Mail had</text>
  <text start="614.639" dur="4.62">Putin sends submarine into English</text>
  <text start="617.399" dur="5.79">Channel days before England verse Russia</text>
  <text start="619.259" dur="5.401">at Euro 2016 and they continually went</text>
  <text start="623.189" dur="5.34">on with this but what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="624.66" dur="7.619">about this is that the submarine was</text>
  <text start="628.529" dur="12.081">above water first of all and it was</text>
  <text start="632.279" dur="11.66">being tugged around by a vessel and</text>
  <text start="640.61" dur="5.979">Russia is very surprised about this</text>
  <text start="643.939" dur="5.68">because they&amp;#39;re saying okay first of all</text>
  <text start="646.589" dur="7.201">the sub wasn&amp;#39;t under water it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="649.619" dur="10.041">towed around and it took the Royal Navy</text>
  <text start="653.79" dur="8.849">and NATO allies to find this sub it</text>
  <text start="659.66" dur="6.339">seems a little ridiculous but this was</text>
  <text start="662.639" dur="7.05">used as a propaganda stunt to make it</text>
  <text start="665.999" dur="7.291">seem like they were continuous Russian</text>
  <text start="669.689" dur="5.971">subs coming into this area and most of</text>
  <text start="673.29" dur="7.889">these type of stories turn out to be</text>
  <text start="675.66" dur="8.07">pure propaganda and the private western</text>
  <text start="681.179" dur="5.16">central bank countries love to use this</text>
  <text start="683.73" dur="6.51">now the question is why are they doing</text>
  <text start="686.339" dur="7.23">this well they need to prepare the</text>
  <text start="690.24" dur="7.019">people they need for the people to</text>
  <text start="693.569" dur="4.411">understand that Russia China North Korea</text>
  <text start="697.259" dur="3.541">array</text>
  <text start="697.98" dur="5.4">in Syria many of the BRIC nations these</text>
  <text start="700.8" dur="5.67">are the enemies that will be going to</text>
  <text start="703.38" dur="4.8">war with now the United States looks to</text>
  <text start="706.47" dur="5.03">increase the pace of joint exercises</text>
  <text start="708.18" dur="6.18">with the George Georgie and military and</text>
  <text start="711.5" dur="4.81">we can see right now they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="714.36" dur="3.81">bringing in military assets and military</text>
  <text start="716.31" dur="5.03">troops into this area but they say don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="718.17" dur="5.88">worry they&amp;#39;re not going to be permanent</text>
  <text start="721.34" dur="4.27">well we know when they say they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="724.05" dur="2.76">going to be permanent what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="725.61" dur="4.26">to do is they&amp;#39;re going to bring in</text>
  <text start="726.81" dur="5.52">temporary troops and there&amp;#39;ll be no</text>
  <text start="729.87" dur="7.1">expiration date or they will bring in</text>
  <text start="732.33" dur="8.45">troops and rotate them in this area so</text>
  <text start="736.97" dur="8.47">when you look at this they&amp;#39;re permanent</text>
  <text start="740.78" dur="6.97">but they use this type of doublespeak to</text>
  <text start="745.44" dur="4.47">make everyone believe that no we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="747.75" dur="5.22">putting per minute troops here we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="749.91" dur="4.5">just rotating troops around or we have</text>
  <text start="752.97" dur="4.5">these are temporary but we have no</text>
  <text start="754.41" dur="6.6">expiration date ever now out in turkey</text>
  <text start="757.47" dur="6.27">we see the lawmakers in Turkey they are</text>
  <text start="761.01" dur="4.44">now subject to prosecution after a bill</text>
  <text start="763.74" dur="3.24">allowing criminal charges to be brought</text>
  <text start="765.45" dur="4.23">against legislators was signed by</text>
  <text start="766.98" dur="6.9">President Erdogan they loan no longer</text>
  <text start="769.68" dur="5.61">have immunity and we see that irda one</text>
  <text start="773.88" dur="6.27">is going to be going after these people</text>
  <text start="775.29" dur="8.22">now of course this new law is a</text>
  <text start="780.15" dur="4.98">violation of free speech and he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="783.51" dur="5.1">after certain parties like the Kurds</text>
  <text start="785.13" dur="5.52">like the Kurdistan Workers Party because</text>
  <text start="788.61" dur="7.04">he believes that these are terrorist</text>
  <text start="790.65" dur="7.44">organizations now of course leaders that</text>
  <text start="795.65" dur="4.57">take different parties and say these are</text>
  <text start="798.09" dur="4.59">terrorists these are the parties that</text>
  <text start="800.22" dur="4.65">they are most afraid of they are</text>
  <text start="802.68" dur="5.22">threatened by them and they need to get</text>
  <text start="804.87" dur="4.41">rid of them and sometimes it&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="807.9" dur="4.74">difficult just to come out and wipe them</text>
  <text start="809.28" dur="5.97">out so they use other methods where they</text>
  <text start="812.64" dur="6.2">can get them imprison them and keep them</text>
  <text start="815.25" dur="5.97">away from removing their authority and</text>
  <text start="818.84" dur="6.28">this is exactly what&amp;#39;s happening in</text>
  <text start="821.22" dur="7.29">Turkey now we see the USS dwight</text>
  <text start="825.12" dur="6.78">eisenhower and their strike group that</text>

  <text start="833.67" dur="7.92">joining the USS harry s truman in this</text>
  <text start="837.78" dur="5.31">area and we can see that along with the</text>

  <text start="843.09" dur="6.18">missile cruiser there&amp;#39;s destroyers and</text>
  <text start="846.95" dur="3.82">they&amp;#39;re saying that all this is to go</text>
  <text start="849.27" dur="4.1">after the islamic state now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="850.77" dur="6.18">amazing is that the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="853.37" dur="7.3">continually being reduced in size by</text>
  <text start="856.95" dur="5.01">Russia and we know that the United</text>

  <text start="868.11" dur="8.49">bring them over to Lebanon but at this</text>
  <text start="871.98" dur="7.62">point we see that they have brought</text>
  <text start="876.6" dur="7.05">another aircraft carrier into this area</text>
  <text start="879.6" dur="6.21">and they&amp;#39;re trying to use it as they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="883.65" dur="4.08">going after the Islamic state now the</text>
  <text start="885.81" dur="5.21">Islamic state has been losing a huge</text>
  <text start="887.73" dur="6.39">amount of territory why at this point</text>
  <text start="891.02" dur="6.7">would they bring in another ship like</text>
  <text start="894.12" dur="6.21">this if the Islamic state is losing</text>
  <text start="897.72" dur="8.37">territory their forces have been cut in</text>
  <text start="900.33" dur="6.9">half we see at this time that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="906.09" dur="4.68">preparing for something completely</text>
  <text start="907.23" dur="7.05">different they&amp;#39;re preparing for some</text>
  <text start="910.77" dur="6.21">type of offensive to back the moderate</text>
  <text start="914.28" dur="6.36">rebels to back al-qaeda to back el</text>
  <text start="916.98" dur="6">nusrah this is why everything that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="920.64" dur="5.94">been looking at the missile set up on</text>
  <text start="922.98" dur="7.59">the border of Turkey the u.s. coming in</text>
  <text start="926.58" dur="8.07">and helping Turkey put up surveillance</text>
  <text start="930.57" dur="5.61">on the border the building of bases the</text>
  <text start="934.65" dur="6.3">military assets that have been flowing</text>
  <text start="936.18" dur="6.99">in and we see right now is that the US</text>
  <text start="940.95" dur="5.45">and Turkey they need to defend the</text>
  <text start="943.17" dur="7.38">corridor the oz oz count corridor</text>
  <text start="946.4" dur="6.34">leading to Aleppo and if they can&amp;#39;t hold</text>
  <text start="950.55" dur="6.6">that and the Syrian armed forces and</text>
  <text start="952.74" dur="8.61">Russia capture this area the flow of</text>
  <text start="957.15" dur="8.22">military assets the flow of terrorist</text>
  <text start="961.35" dur="6.3">groups coming into Syria is going to</text>
  <text start="965.37" dur="4.77">stop and this is going to put the United</text>
  <text start="967.65" dur="6.66">States into a corner and this is going</text>
  <text start="970.14" dur="6.99">to be a major major problem and we see</text>
  <text start="974.31" dur="7.219">already there&amp;#39;s a huge buildup of</text>
  <text start="977.13" dur="4.399">terrorist organizations in Aleppo and</text>
  <text start="981.56" dur="4.24">they&amp;#39;re continually bringing in more and</text>
  <text start="984.21" dur="4.7">more military assets because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="985.8" dur="8.13">seeing right now this is the preparation</text>
  <text start="988.91" dur="7.929">for what is about to come and we see</text>
  <text start="993.93" dur="7.32">right now that everything is starting to</text>
  <text start="996.839" dur="8.551">build Israel is flying into Syria right</text>
  <text start="1001.25" dur="7.98">now and they hit a military base in</text>
  <text start="1005.39" dur="6.51">homes because they&amp;#39;re doing whatever</text>
  <text start="1009.23" dur="4.23">they possibly can to set everything up</text>
  <text start="1011.9" dur="3.42">for what is coming because you have to</text>
  <text start="1013.46" dur="4.23">remember the coalition forces they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1015.32" dur="4.11">been preparing getting ready for what is</text>
  <text start="1017.69" dur="3.98">coming most likely in August all</text>
  <text start="1019.43" dur="5.399">indicators right now are still on track</text>
  <text start="1021.67" dur="6.7">nothing has changed up to this point we</text>
  <text start="1024.829" dur="7.141">see that Syria Russia and Iran they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1028.37" dur="8.4">having a meeting tomorrow about the</text>
  <text start="1031.97" dur="7.68">situation in Syria so they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="1036.77" dur="5.309">this situation they&amp;#39;re seeing military</text>
  <text start="1039.65" dur="5.88">assets being moved in they&amp;#39;re seeing new</text>
  <text start="1042.079" dur="7.441">ships arrive we know that NATO Germany</text>
  <text start="1045.53" dur="6.63">the other coalition forces all have</text>
  <text start="1049.52" dur="4.289">ships around this area of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1052.16" dur="2.94">using the excuse that they&amp;#39;re helping</text>
  <text start="1053.809" dur="3.891">the refugees but they&amp;#39;re there on</text>
  <text start="1055.1" dur="5.28">purpose so they can use them later on</text>
  <text start="1057.7" dur="6.58">they&amp;#39;re very close to the situation of</text>
  <text start="1060.38" dur="6.9">Libya of Syria of the entire area and</text>
  <text start="1064.28" dur="4.8">they can have these ships in in where</text>
  <text start="1067.28" dur="6.84">they need them in a matter of moments</text>
  <text start="1069.08" dur="7.26">and we can see right now that all this</text>
  <text start="1074.12" dur="4.74">is being prepared now to get this off</text>
  <text start="1076.34" dur="5.19">the ground most likely they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1078.86" dur="5.04">need some type of an event we see that</text>
  <text start="1081.53" dur="5.31">their reports coming out and this is</text>
  <text start="1083.9" dur="4.23">mostly propaganda to scare everyone to</text>
  <text start="1086.84" dur="3.81">let everyone know that this is coming</text>
  <text start="1088.13" dur="6.48">where the Islamic state has kill lists</text>
  <text start="1090.65" dur="6.54">of thousands of Americans we&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="1094.61" dur="4.439">getting a report which I find very</text>
  <text start="1097.19" dur="3.809">interesting is that</text>
  <text start="1099.049" dur="5.25">a large number of Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1100.999" dur="6.77">militants have already been trained for</text>
  <text start="1104.299" dur="6.031">suicide tax with chemical bombs and</text>
  <text start="1107.769" dur="5.591">they&amp;#39;re saying that the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1110.33" dur="6.36">has already equipped these people they</text>
  <text start="1113.36" dur="5.069">already have the chemical bombs and they</text>
  <text start="1116.69" dur="5.699">fear they&amp;#39;re going to be using them in</text>
  <text start="1118.429" dur="6.99">Iraq and Syria or maybe some other</text>
  <text start="1122.389" dur="6.77">country we don&amp;#39;t know for sure now if</text>
  <text start="1125.419" dur="6.99">they do do this this could be an event</text>
  <text start="1129.159" dur="7.21">where the US says okay enough&amp;#39;s enough</text>
  <text start="1132.409" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re using chemical weapons and they</text>
  <text start="1136.369" dur="3.63">could use this as an event to say we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1137.899" dur="4.921">going into Syria we&amp;#39;re going into a rack</text>
  <text start="1139.999" dur="5.841">full fledge to stop this because now</text>
  <text start="1142.82" dur="5.039">they&amp;#39;re killing people using these</text>
  <text start="1145.84" dur="4.179">dangerous chemical weapons then of</text>
  <text start="1147.859" dur="3.601">course as we know this was a complete</text>
  <text start="1150.019" dur="4.26">set up by the US government central</text>
  <text start="1151.46" dur="4.679">bankers and the coalition forces to</text>
  <text start="1154.279" dur="3.51">convince everyone this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1156.139" dur="4.321">going to do we also have to remember</text>
  <text start="1157.789" dur="5.61">that France most likely is ripe for a</text>
  <text start="1160.46" dur="8.299">terrorist attack so we might see events</text>
  <text start="1163.399" dur="8.51">occur in many different places at once</text>
  <text start="1168.759" dur="8.591">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="1171.909" dur="8.59">DHS they are preparing very hard right</text>
  <text start="1177.35" dur="5.85">now for something that is coming now</text>
  <text start="1180.499" dur="5.101">what is that well a recent report which</text>
  <text start="1183.2" dur="3.99">was released says that the Department of</text>
  <text start="1185.6" dur="3.299">Homeland Security and Emergency</text>
  <text start="1187.19" dur="5.88">Management command center has been</text>
  <text start="1188.899" dur="5.22">monitoring metro and area roads now</text>
  <text start="1193.07" dur="3">they&amp;#39;re saying this could be for a</text>
  <text start="1194.119" dur="4.29">natural disaster or a terrorist attack</text>
  <text start="1196.07" dur="5.809">if something should happen in a city</text>
  <text start="1198.409" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re setting up evacuation routes and</text>
  <text start="1201.879" dur="4.78">they&amp;#39;re saying we are working on a plan</text>
  <text start="1204.379" dur="4.62">where we can get people out of the city</text>
  <text start="1206.659" dur="7.49">very very quickly and control the</text>
  <text start="1208.999" dur="5.15">traffic this is very interesting and</text>
  <text start="1214.929" dur="6.511">during this time period they will</text>
  <text start="1217.82" dur="7.349">control all security cameras in</text>
  <text start="1221.44" dur="5.739">different areas of the cities and of</text>
  <text start="1225.169" dur="4.35">course what they want is they want to</text>
  <text start="1227.179" dur="4.47">make sure that this false flag isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1229.519" dur="3.251">reported as a false flag and if they</text>
  <text start="1231.649" dur="3.281">spot something</text>
  <text start="1232.77" dur="4.97">they can go after that person and cover</text>
  <text start="1234.93" dur="7.26">up what is happening because as we know</text>
  <text start="1237.74" dur="6.16">when this event occurs it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="1242.19" dur="4.35">a false flag it&amp;#39;s something that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
