  <text start="30.68" dur="5.49">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="34.61" dur="4.11">rapport my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="36.17" dur="5.49">episode 1093 b and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="38.72" dur="4.92">October 5th 2016 and the time of the</text>
  <text start="41.66" dur="4.14">episode is the US government central</text>
  <text start="43.64" dur="5.94">bankers are very close to closing down</text>
  <text start="45.8" dur="6.27">our society let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="49.58" dur="5.46">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="52.07" dur="6.239">now a couple reports back we talked</text>
  <text start="55.04" dur="6.659">about how the internet was being shipped</text>
  <text start="58.309" dur="6.24">off to the UN and it happened the United</text>
  <text start="61.699" dur="5.881">States now is not in control of the icon</text>
  <text start="64.549" dur="5.341">service and we see the UN has full</text>
  <text start="67.58" dur="5.31">control and we understand that the UN</text>
  <text start="69.89" dur="6.99">has their own rules and what they</text>
  <text start="72.89" dur="6.659">consider free speech what they consider</text>
  <text start="76.88" dur="4.77">what should be censored what should not</text>
  <text start="79.549" dur="5.211">be censored and we see here in the</text>
  <text start="81.65" dur="8.1">United States there were 77 US senators</text>
  <text start="84.76" dur="7.749">that voted yes to give away the Internet</text>
  <text start="89.75" dur="5.76">to the UN and we understand that this is</text>
  <text start="92.509" dur="6.171">part of the process of creating a</text>
  <text start="95.51" dur="7.77">one-world government taking control of</text>
  <text start="98.68" dur="8.44">the internet so this way they can censor</text>
  <text start="103.28" dur="5.94">anything they want at any time and the</text>
  <text start="107.12" dur="5.61">US government central bankers can say</text>
  <text start="109.22" dur="6.27">hey it&amp;#39;s the UN we we want to give you</text>
  <text start="112.73" dur="5.16">free speech but it&amp;#39;s the UN that decided</text>
  <text start="115.49" dur="5.25">to censor it and where are you going to</text>
  <text start="117.89" dur="6.36">argue the case that how dare you censor</text>
  <text start="120.74" dur="5.94">this website or this podcast or this</text>
  <text start="124.25" dur="5.489">video it&amp;#39;s going to be very difficult</text>
  <text start="126.68" dur="5.37">and this is exactly what they want is it</text>
  <text start="129.739" dur="6.481">going to happen by tomorrow no but it</text>
  <text start="132.05" dur="6.78">will happen over time and you&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="136.22" dur="4.2">going surfing the internet and all of a</text>
  <text start="138.83" dur="4.92">sudden you&amp;#39;ll come up with - a message</text>
  <text start="140.42" dur="6.84">that says sorry this website is censored</text>
  <text start="143.75" dur="8.76">sorry this video is censored by the UN</text>
  <text start="147.26" dur="9.39">and that will be that there was a survey</text>
  <text start="152.51" dur="8.97">that was done and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="156.65" dur="8.12">United States is not the freest country</text>
  <text start="161.48" dur="6.48">in the world</text>
  <text start="164.77" dur="6.28">according to the lagano prosperity index</text>
  <text start="167.96" dur="5.4">it found that the US has dropped to the</text>
  <text start="171.05" dur="4.17">15th most free country in the world</text>
  <text start="173.36" dur="6.15">behind Costa Rica</text>
  <text start="175.22" dur="6">ergh way among others perhaps even more</text>
  <text start="179.51" dur="5">staggering is that the u.s. dropped to</text>
  <text start="181.22" dur="8.19">33rd in terms of safety and security</text>
  <text start="184.51" dur="8.2">raking behind Slovakia and just ahead of</text>
  <text start="189.41" dur="4.92">United Arab Emirates and of course as we</text>
  <text start="192.71" dur="4.08">know the United States government</text>
  <text start="194.33" dur="5.97">central bankers continually tell us how</text>
  <text start="196.79" dur="6.57">they have to keep us safe how we need</text>
  <text start="200.3" dur="7.73">more security how it&amp;#39;s going to make it</text>
  <text start="203.36" dur="11.19">better and they&amp;#39;ve been doing this since</text>
  <text start="208.03" dur="9.91">2001 the last 15 years and the US has</text>
  <text start="214.55" dur="6.51">dropped to 33 because the US government</text>
  <text start="217.94" dur="6.15">central bankers they&amp;#39;re not keeping the</text>
  <text start="221.06" dur="6.6">people safe they&amp;#39;re controlling the</text>
  <text start="224.09" dur="7.679">people we have to remember most of these</text>
  <text start="227.66" dur="6.15">events are created by the government to</text>
  <text start="231.769" dur="5.481">scare the people to take away their</text>
  <text start="233.81" dur="7.26">rights to scare them into submission</text>
  <text start="237.25" dur="7.95">that&amp;#39;s what this is about and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="241.07" dur="6.33">proof that whatever they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="245.2" dur="3.819">doesn&amp;#39;t work if you want to believe the</text>
  <text start="247.4" dur="7.44">official story that they need to keep us</text>
  <text start="249.019" dur="9.21">safe so we can see right now that all of</text>
  <text start="254.84" dur="6.81">this where were the freest in the world</text>
  <text start="258.229" dur="6.861">we&amp;#39;re the safest in the world well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.65" dur="6.23">just not true actually</text>
  <text start="265.09" dur="4.9">maybe if we remove the government and</text>
  <text start="267.88" dur="3.19">put in a smaller government</text>
  <text start="269.99" dur="4.07">that&amp;#39;s not controlled by foreign</text>
  <text start="271.07" dur="5.4">entities corporations central banks</text>
  <text start="274.06" dur="5.08">maybe we would be the freest country</text>
  <text start="276.47" dur="6.35">maybe we would be the safest country</text>
  <text start="279.14" dur="7.589">where we wouldn&amp;#39;t see all these events</text>
  <text start="282.82" dur="6">most likely yes we see John Kerry is out</text>
  <text start="286.729" dur="5.491">in Brussels he was giving a speech and</text>
  <text start="288.82" dur="5.98">he came out and said the US remains</text>
  <text start="292.22" dur="5.31">committed to protecting Ukraine from</text>
  <text start="294.8" dur="5.85">Russian aggression now we have to</text>
  <text start="297.53" dur="4.68">what&amp;#39;s happening in Ukraine we realized</text>
  <text start="300.65" dur="4.08">that the central bankers had a coup</text>
  <text start="302.21" dur="5.07">d&amp;#39;etat in Ukraine they didn&amp;#39;t debt they</text>
  <text start="304.73" dur="4.05">didn&amp;#39;t get the entire country they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="307.28" dur="4.44">have the southeastern area where they</text>
  <text start="308.78" dur="5.13">have coal production manufacturing they</text>
  <text start="311.72" dur="5.64">didn&amp;#39;t get Crimea where there&amp;#39;s the port</text>
  <text start="313.91" dur="7.08">and right now all they have is the west</text>
  <text start="317.36" dur="4.89">of Ukraine and this is a problem for the</text>
  <text start="320.99" dur="3.18">central bankers this is why the United</text>
  <text start="322.25" dur="4.2">States and other nations are in there</text>
  <text start="324.17" dur="6.33">supplying one them with non-lethal and</text>
  <text start="326.45" dur="6.81">now lethal weapons and training their</text>
  <text start="330.5" dur="7.56">National Guard their Armed Forces police</text>
  <text start="333.26" dur="6.659">forces bringing in US advisors because</text>
  <text start="338.06" dur="5.19">what we can see right now this is the</text>
  <text start="339.919" dur="5.071">build-up for another offensive they</text>
  <text start="343.25" dur="3.99">tried to get something kicked off the</text>
  <text start="344.99" dur="5.4">ground when they had their agent</text>
  <text start="347.24" dur="5.13">provocateurs go into Crimea tried to</text>
  <text start="350.39" dur="3.84">have some type of false flag and the</text>
  <text start="352.37" dur="6.15">whole thing just completely fell apart</text>
  <text start="354.23" dur="8.34">to try to start the war with Russia and</text>
  <text start="358.52" dur="5.91">Crimea and the southeastern area we see</text>
  <text start="362.57" dur="4.29">US Secretary of State John Kerry called</text>
  <text start="364.43" dur="5.1">for Russia China Pakistan India and Iran</text>
  <text start="366.86" dur="5.91">to help Afghanistan overcome its</text>
  <text start="369.53" dur="4.53">problems well we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="372.77" dur="3.81">United States is having a very tough</text>
  <text start="374.06" dur="5.55">time because the people but the people</text>
  <text start="376.58" dur="5.37">of Afghanistan are saying we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="379.61" dur="4.47">enough of the United States government</text>
  <text start="381.95" dur="4.32">central bankers in our country remember</text>
  <text start="384.08" dur="7.05">Afghanistan is a very very strategic</text>
  <text start="386.27" dur="7.5">area they have oil lithium copper Russia</text>
  <text start="391.13" dur="5.31">China are in there working with the</text>
  <text start="393.77" dur="4.709">government United States is growing</text>
  <text start="396.44" dur="4.979">poppies protecting the poppy fields</text>
  <text start="398.479" dur="6.541">using the poppies to sell overseas to</text>
  <text start="401.419" dur="7.051">pay for their covert missions their</text>
  <text start="405.02" dur="5.49">covert military operations around the</text>
  <text start="408.47" dur="4.8">world and this is what they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="410.51" dur="6.719">protecting they&amp;#39;re not doing it for the</text>
  <text start="413.27" dur="7.05">people they&amp;#39;re doing it for themselves</text>
  <text start="417.229" dur="8.851">for the profit to wage war on other</text>
  <text start="420.32" dur="7.68">countries we see Russia is calling on</text>
  <text start="426.08" dur="4.63">the u.s. to return to intermediate-range</text>
  <text start="428" dur="5.11">nuclear forces treaty</text>
  <text start="430.71" dur="4.47">now this treaty was signed in 1987 the</text>
  <text start="433.11" dur="3.84">treaty prohibits the development testing</text>
  <text start="435.18" dur="4.56">or fielding of ground-based cruise</text>
  <text start="436.95" dur="6.51">missiles with a range of 300 to 3400</text>
  <text start="439.74" dur="5.4">miles and we can see right now both</text>
  <text start="443.46" dur="4.68">countries are pointing at each other</text>
  <text start="445.14" dur="4.53">saying listen you&amp;#39;re not abiding by this</text>
  <text start="448.14" dur="3.78">treaty because we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="449.67" dur="3.9">US government central bankers they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="451.92" dur="4.47">want to abide by this treaty because</text>
  <text start="453.57" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re getting ready for war they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="456.39" dur="6.78">getting ready to create some type of an</text>
  <text start="459.36" dur="7.52">event to bring us to war now the u.s.</text>
  <text start="463.17" dur="6.36">right now since they didn&amp;#39;t get Crimea</text>
  <text start="466.88" dur="7.32">to have ships on the Black Sea</text>
  <text start="469.53" dur="9.51">they&amp;#39;re building a deep sea port in</text>
  <text start="474.2" dur="8.38">Georgia and we can see right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="479.04" dur="7.95">telling us that it&amp;#39;s for cargo transit</text>
  <text start="482.58" dur="7.05">from Asia to Europe but there might be a</text>
  <text start="486.99" dur="4.29">hidden agenda behind all this most</text>
  <text start="489.63" dur="4.26">likely they&amp;#39;re building this port right</text>
  <text start="491.28" dur="5.64">on the Black Sea so they can turn it</text>
  <text start="493.89" dur="6.87">into a US naval base and it would be</text>
  <text start="496.92" dur="7.68">right near Russia this is actually why</text>
  <text start="500.76" dur="7.68">they wanted Ukraine so we can see right</text>
  <text start="504.6" dur="6.24">now they&amp;#39;re continually preparing for</text>
  <text start="508.44" dur="4.29">the next stage and they&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="510.84" dur="4.08">military assets all over the world</text>
  <text start="512.73" dur="4.62">moving troops all over the world it has</text>
  <text start="514.92" dur="6.3">not died down it has actually</text>
  <text start="517.35" dur="6.9">accelerated we see Iraq is warning</text>
  <text start="521.22" dur="6.17">Turkey that they need to withdraw their</text>
  <text start="524.25" dur="7.26">troops from Iraq remember Turkey invaded</text>
  <text start="527.39" dur="5.29">Iraq Iraq has been telling Turkey to get</text>
  <text start="531.51" dur="4.08">out of their country</text>
  <text start="532.68" dur="6.5">turkey has invaded Syria the United</text>
  <text start="535.59" dur="8.31">States has invaded Syria the UK France</text>
  <text start="539.18" dur="6.61">all have invaded these countries they</text>
  <text start="543.9" dur="3.72">did not get permission to be in Syria</text>
  <text start="545.79" dur="3.93">turkey didn&amp;#39;t get permission to be in</text>
  <text start="547.62" dur="4.56">Iraq and they&amp;#39;re warning that this might</text>
  <text start="549.72" dur="5.91">trigger a regional war by keeping the</text>
  <text start="552.18" dur="5.19">troops in their territory and this is</text>
  <text start="555.63" dur="3.9">exactly what the US government central</text>
  <text start="557.37" dur="5.1">bankers want they want a war to break</text>
  <text start="559.53" dur="5.38">out anyway anywhere they possibly can</text>
  <text start="562.47" dur="4.96">make it happen they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="564.91" dur="5.6">because they&amp;#39;ll just ramp it up because</text>
  <text start="567.43" dur="8.73">the players are all the same</text>
  <text start="570.51" dur="9.25">now John Kerry is slamming Russia for</text>
  <text start="576.16" dur="7.58">backing the Syrian government he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="579.76" dur="5.94">criticizing Russia for supporting Assad</text>
  <text start="583.74" dur="5.62">describing it as irresponsible</text>
  <text start="585.7" dur="5.15">profoundly ill-advised well the only</text>
  <text start="589.36" dur="4.44">reason he&amp;#39;s saying this is because</text>
  <text start="590.85" dur="4.69">Russia and Syria are kicking out the</text>
  <text start="593.8" dur="5.1">United States kicking out their</text>
  <text start="595.54" dur="5.97">terrorist groups they&amp;#39;re winning the war</text>
  <text start="598.9" dur="4.32">and you can see right now the United</text>
  <text start="601.51" dur="4.44">States is using any type of propaganda</text>
  <text start="603.22" dur="5.46">they possibly can to try to get back</text>
  <text start="605.95" dur="6.99">into the game remember all this is about</text>
  <text start="608.68" dur="7.16">is the petro dollar building a oil</text>
  <text start="612.94" dur="5.97">pipeline through Syria Assad objected a</text>
  <text start="615.84" dur="6.91">couple months later all of a sudden we</text>
  <text start="618.91" dur="7.02">had riots protests a civil war all</text>
  <text start="622.75" dur="4.56">funded by the United States the moderate</text>
  <text start="625.93" dur="3.99">rebels weren&amp;#39;t even model rebels back</text>
  <text start="627.31" dur="4.23">then they were al-qaeda and then all of</text>
  <text start="629.92" dur="3.57">a sudden broke that the United States</text>
  <text start="631.54" dur="3.8">was supporting al-qaeda and then they</text>
  <text start="633.49" dur="5.03">started calling them the moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="635.34" dur="8.35">but we know they&amp;#39;re all one in the same</text>
  <text start="638.52" dur="7.78">and we can see right now that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="643.69" dur="5.13">pushing war as hard as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="646.3" dur="6.84">and they&amp;#39;re going to be using more and</text>
  <text start="648.82" dur="6.69">more propaganda to get this started now</text>
  <text start="653.14" dur="5.28">we know out in Syria the battle is</text>
  <text start="655.51" dur="5.67">continuing in Aleppo and we see right</text>
  <text start="658.42" dur="4.35">now the Syrian government the Russian</text>
  <text start="661.18" dur="3.33">government they&amp;#39;re going to be reducing</text>
  <text start="662.77" dur="4.71">their airstrikes and shelling in eastern</text>
  <text start="664.51" dur="4.89">Aleppo they&amp;#39;re gonna allow civilians to</text>
  <text start="667.48" dur="4.32">leave this area they want all the</text>
  <text start="669.4" dur="4.53">civilians out because they want to clean</text>
  <text start="671.8" dur="3">up the rest of the terrorists and this</text>
  <text start="673.93" dur="2.85">is what the United States government</text>
  <text start="674.8" dur="6.99">central bankers this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="676.78" dur="7.35">worried about that Russia and Syria are</text>
  <text start="681.79" dur="4.38">going to have all these civilians or</text>
  <text start="684.13" dur="4.92">most of them leave so this way they can</text>
  <text start="686.17" dur="7.08">go all out on their terrorists</text>
  <text start="689.05" dur="8.55">mercenaries and once they clear Aleppo</text>
  <text start="693.25" dur="5.709">and they take Aleppo back the United</text>
  <text start="697.6" dur="4.469">States government Central</text>
  <text start="698.959" dur="5.341">they are in a corner right now this is</text>
  <text start="702.069" dur="5.83">something they probably didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="704.3" dur="6.51">expect and now they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="707.899" dur="5.37">do something else most likely some type</text>
  <text start="710.81" dur="4.5">of an event and most likely this is</text>
  <text start="713.269" dur="3.99">something we&amp;#39;re going to see we see</text>
  <text start="715.31" dur="5.25">Russia is taking no chances whatsoever</text>
  <text start="717.259" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re bringing in two warships these</text>
  <text start="720.56" dur="4.05">are armed with caliber cruise missiles</text>
  <text start="722.569" dur="3.811">they&amp;#39;ll join the permanent grouping of</text>
  <text start="724.61" dur="4.169">Russians Russia&amp;#39;s Navy and the</text>
  <text start="726.38" dur="4.139">Mediterranean Sea and we can see right</text>
  <text start="728.779" dur="4.201">now they have the aircraft carrier there</text>
  <text start="730.519" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re bringing in more warships they</text>
  <text start="732.98" dur="4.7">realized that the United States well</text>

  <text start="855.68" dur="6.779">contributed to the unrest and a civil</text>
  <text start="859.76" dur="4.59">war broke out well I guess he forgot to</text>
  <text start="862.459" dur="4.371">mention that they wanted to build a gas</text>
  <text start="864.35" dur="5.429">pipeline through Syria they asked aside</text>

  <text start="873.02" dur="5.97">out of nowhere and then that didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="876.35" dur="4.02">so all of a sudden a civil war broke out</text>
  <text start="878.99" dur="4.95">because the United States brought in</text>
  <text start="880.37" dur="7.01">al-qaeda and paid mercenaries to fight</text>
  <text start="883.94" dur="7.019">in the Civil War to remove Assad that</text>

  <text start="903.529" dur="7.111">moderate rebels so we have nothing to do</text>
  <text start="907.52" dur="5.55">with al-qaeda then we find out they were</text>
  <text start="910.64" dur="5.34">having all these false flags saying that</text>
  <text start="913.07" dur="6.99">Assad gassed his own people which turned</text>

  <text start="1044.47" dur="11.07">into Sudan into Libya into Lebanon into</text>
  <text start="1049.72" dur="8.1">Iraq into Syria then into a ran they</text>
  <text start="1055.54" dur="5.82">already had it planned out this has</text>
  <text start="1057.82" dur="9.33">nothing to do with global warming the</text>
  <text start="1061.36" dur="7.92">whole thing is made up now in past</text>
  <text start="1067.15" dur="4.23">reports we always do a check to see</text>
  <text start="1069.28" dur="3.59">where we are because we understand the</text>
  <text start="1071.38" dur="4.29">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="1072.87" dur="6.49">they&amp;#39;re in the process of closing down</text>
  <text start="1075.67" dur="10.11">our society an Amy Naomi Wolf created a</text>
  <text start="1079.36" dur="8.04">ten step breakdown of how a society is</text>
  <text start="1085.78" dur="6.27">closed down and she did research and</text>
  <text start="1087.4" dur="8.76">this ten steps fits into every model of</text>
  <text start="1092.05" dur="7.71">every society closing down and the first</text>
  <text start="1096.16" dur="3.99">one is invoke a terrifying internal or</text>
  <text start="1099.76" dur="3.48">ex</text>
  <text start="1100.15" dur="5.87">Journal enemy which they did create they</text>
  <text start="1103.24" dur="7.23">created the Islamic state al-qaeda and</text>
  <text start="1106.02" dur="6.19">they made us believe that we are under</text>
  <text start="1110.47" dur="2.75">threat and the Islamic state is all over</text>
  <text start="1112.21" dur="6.36">the place</text>
  <text start="1113.22" dur="7.75">create a gulag so basically once you</text>
  <text start="1118.57" dur="4.47">have everyone scared the next step is to</text>
  <text start="1120.97" dur="5.01">create a prison system outside the rule</text>
  <text start="1123.04" dur="6.95">of law which they did go katana MoBay</text>
  <text start="1125.98" dur="7.8">and this way all those people out there</text>
  <text start="1129.99" dur="6.4">they were able to arrest them detain</text>
  <text start="1133.78" dur="5.01">them without due process we know we had</text>
  <text start="1136.39" dur="4.59">one in Chicago where they were doing it</text>
  <text start="1138.79" dur="4.41">and most likely others around the</text>
