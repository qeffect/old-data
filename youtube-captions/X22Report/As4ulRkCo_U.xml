  <text start="65.14" dur="4.47">the episode is d dollarization continues</text>
  <text start="68.02" dur="5.07">as more countries separate themselves</text>
  <text start="69.61" dur="5.789">from the dollar let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="73.09" dur="4.23">economic collapse financial news now we</text>
  <text start="75.399" dur="4.321">understand that the central bank they</text>
  <text start="77.32" dur="5.37">work on depth and what they need to do</text>
  <text start="79.72" dur="4.95">is they need to expand the amount of</text>
  <text start="82.69" dur="3.929">debt because if they don&amp;#39;t do this their</text>
  <text start="84.67" dur="3.69">system falls apart and this is why there</text>
  <text start="86.619" dur="2.79">are continually expanding auto loans</text>
  <text start="88.36" dur="3.09">this is why they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="89.409" dur="3.481">expanding student loans this is why</text>
  <text start="91.45" dur="3.479">they&amp;#39;re continually expanding housing</text>
  <text start="92.89" dur="3.899">loans this is why they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="94.929" dur="3.961">pushing credit this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="96.789" dur="3.961">letting countries borrow because what</text>
  <text start="98.89" dur="4.05">they need to do is they need to spread</text>
  <text start="100.75" dur="4.2">debt further and further this is why</text>
  <text start="102.94" dur="4.739">they bring in subprime people because if</text>
  <text start="104.95" dur="5.43">they stop doing all this what happens</text>
  <text start="107.679" dur="5.19">the entire system completely falls apart</text>
  <text start="110.38" dur="5.37">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="112.869" dur="5.821">consumer borrowing well it has surged in</text>
  <text start="115.75" dur="5.52">July total consumer credit increased by</text>
  <text start="118.69" dur="6.06">eighteen point five billion in July to</text>
  <text start="121.27" dur="5.25">three point seven five trillion growing</text>
  <text start="124.75" dur="3.179">at an annual rate of six point nine</text>
  <text start="126.52" dur="3.15">percent this is coming from the Federal</text>
  <text start="127.929" dur="2.97">Reserve now remember the corporate media</text>
  <text start="129.67" dur="3.209">is out they are the Federal Reserve is</text>
  <text start="130.899" dur="4.351">out there and most of the time they tell</text>
  <text start="132.879" dur="4.561">you the economy is doing well because</text>
  <text start="135.25" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re looking at the debt portion of</text>
  <text start="137.44" dur="3.51">it oh look more people are spending</text>
  <text start="139.09" dur="3.27">money well they&amp;#39;re not actually spending</text>
  <text start="140.95" dur="3.3">the money they have what they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="142.36" dur="4.379">saying is they&amp;#39;re taking out more debt</text>
  <text start="144.25" dur="5.879">because this is exactly what they like</text>
  <text start="146.739" dur="5.401">now it has increased since June and what</text>
  <text start="150.129" dur="4.321">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing is that the debt</text>
  <text start="152.14" dur="4.65">levels for the everyday American is</text>
  <text start="154.45" dur="3.75">continually increasing and this is</text>
  <text start="156.79" dur="3.51">something that they look at and it</text>
  <text start="158.2" dur="5.1">sounds great on the news in the way they</text>
  <text start="160.3" dur="5.159">you know basically tell the story but</text>
  <text start="163.3" dur="3.96">it&amp;#39;s not really good for the everyday</text>
  <text start="165.459" dur="4.291">person because what that really means is</text>
  <text start="167.26" dur="4.979">they don&amp;#39;t have cash on hand and they</text>
  <text start="169.75" dur="4.26">need debt to survive and as things</text>
  <text start="172.239" dur="3.841">become more and more expensive and as</text>
  <text start="174.01" dur="4.5">the value of the dollar decreases what</text>
  <text start="176.08" dur="4.739">happens you need to take out that loans</text>
  <text start="178.51" dur="3.93">I mean think about it with a purchase of</text>
  <text start="180.819" dur="2.871">a car no one&amp;#39;s going into a car</text>
  <text start="182.44" dur="4.3">dealership and saying here here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="183.69" dur="4.79">$42,000 here&amp;#39;s 38,000</text>
  <text start="186.74" dur="3.54">house no one&amp;#39;s going saying hey here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="188.48" dur="3.51">300 thousand four hundred thousand in</text>
  <text start="190.28" dur="3.87">cash know what everyone needs to do</text>
  <text start="191.99" dur="4.92">right now is they need to take out debt</text>
  <text start="194.15" dur="5.19">and this whole thing has been created to</text>
  <text start="196.91" dur="4.47">make people use the debt because this</text>
  <text start="199.34" dur="3.96">keeps their system chugging along but</text>
  <text start="201.38" dur="3.75">what happens is is when more and more</text>
  <text start="203.3" dur="4.38">people lose their jobs when people are</text>
  <text start="205.13" dur="4.77">making less money they start slowing</text>
  <text start="207.68" dur="5.34">down they don&amp;#39;t purchase things on</text>
  <text start="209.9" dur="4.74">credit anymore maybe the necessities but</text>
  <text start="213.02" dur="3">everything else they don&amp;#39;t do and this</text>
  <text start="214.64" dur="4.56">is why we&amp;#39;re seeing this draw this</text>
  <text start="216.02" dur="5.91">pullback from retail because people they</text>
  <text start="219.2" dur="4.95">just can&amp;#39;t afford it right now we see</text>
  <text start="221.93" dur="4.83">wholesale inventories they&amp;#39;ve they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="224.15" dur="5.97">jumped to the highest since November</text>
  <text start="226.76" dur="4.79">sales are sliding right now now what</text>
  <text start="230.12" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that host sales</text>
  <text start="231.55" dur="4.9">wholesale sales they have fallen for</text>
  <text start="234.08" dur="4.35">four of the last five months with July</text>
  <text start="236.45" dur="6.54">sales dropping by 0.1% month on month</text>
  <text start="238.43" dur="7.65">and as these sales drop and hotel</text>
  <text start="242.99" dur="6.66">inventories increase we are running into</text>
  <text start="246.08" dur="6.48">major problems now this will add to the</text>
  <text start="249.65" dur="5.22">GDP for the next quarter but we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="252.56" dur="3.81">have a hangover going down the line</text>
  <text start="254.87" dur="3.929">because the Atlanta Fed right now is</text>
  <text start="256.37" dur="4.35">reporting that the third quarter GDP</text>
  <text start="258.799" dur="5.071">well they&amp;#39;re forecasting at three</text>
  <text start="260.72" dur="4.85">percent now we know these GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="263.87" dur="5.64">are completely fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="265.57" dur="6.22">seventy percent of it is based on retail</text>
  <text start="269.51" dur="4.8">spending now just thinking and also</text>
  <text start="271.79" dur="3.78">health insurance is included in this but</text>
  <text start="274.31" dur="5.79">think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="275.57" dur="6.09">retail is imploding on itself stores are</text>
  <text start="280.1" dur="4.32">going out of business they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="281.66" dur="4.71">the sales so how are they getting this</text>
  <text start="284.42" dur="3.9">GDP number up now they used to include</text>
  <text start="286.37" dur="3.96">Obama care with this and they were able</text>
  <text start="288.32" dur="4.77">to manipulate it very very well well</text>
  <text start="290.33" dur="4.92">that is also imploding and we can see</text>
  <text start="293.09" dur="4.74">right now that this number right now is</text>
  <text start="295.25" dur="3.24">completely fake phony and false and what</text>
  <text start="297.83" dur="2.73">they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="298.49" dur="4.58">continually manipulate it make it seem</text>
  <text start="300.56" dur="5.07">like it&amp;#39;s better than it ever was and</text>
  <text start="303.07" dur="4.78">nothing has changed actually I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>
  <text start="305.63" dur="4.38">things have changed things have gotten a</text>
  <text start="307.85" dur="3.48">lot worse and as we move throughout this</text>
  <text start="310.01" dur="2.79">year we&amp;#39;re going to see things</text>
  <text start="311.33" dur="3.3">deteriorate I&amp;#39;m talking about the real</text>
  <text start="312.8" dur="3.99">economy I&amp;#39;m not talking about the fake</text>
  <text start="314.63" dur="3.42">economy with all these statistical</text>
  <text start="316.79" dur="2.67">numbers where they can manipulate it</text>
  <text start="318.05" dur="2.46">really really well to make it look like</text>
  <text start="319.46" dur="2.58">everything is fine</text>
  <text start="320.51" dur="4.2">just like the stock market now talking</text>
  <text start="322.04" dur="5.82">about the stock market we understand</text>
  <text start="324.71" dur="5.91">that the central banks they manipulate</text>
  <text start="327.86" dur="4.41">the stock market and in this latest flow</text>
  <text start="330.62" dur="4.74">report from Bank of America Michael</text>
  <text start="332.27" dur="6.33">Hartnett looks at the disconnect myth</text>
  <text start="335.36" dur="6.27">between rising stocks and bonds and what</text>
  <text start="338.6" dur="5.85">the central bank is doing and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="341.63" dur="6.18">seeing right now is as the central bank</text>
  <text start="344.45" dur="6.03">adds more and more to their balance</text>
  <text start="347.81" dur="5.28">sheet and we need to understand that the</text>
  <text start="350.48" dur="5.76">central bank is at as has purchased two</text>
  <text start="353.09" dur="6.3">trillion in assets in 2017 and the stock</text>
  <text start="356.24" dur="5.7">market has gone up well in this report</text>
  <text start="359.39" dur="5.43">there is a correlation showing that the</text>
  <text start="361.94" dur="6.45">central bank has been buying these</text>
  <text start="364.82" dur="5.61">stocks and they point out that yes that</text>
  <text start="368.39" dur="4.08">as the central bank as their balance</text>
  <text start="370.43" dur="3.45">sheet increases so does the stock market</text>
  <text start="372.47" dur="3.15">they&amp;#39;re purchasing a lot of stocks and</text>
  <text start="373.88" dur="3.96">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that in</text>
  <text start="375.62" dur="5.04">2017 there has been one point six one</text>
  <text start="377.84" dur="6.42">point nine six trillion of central bank</text>
  <text start="380.66" dur="5.52">purchases of financial assets in 2017</text>
  <text start="384.26" dur="3.87">alone as central bank balance sheets</text>
  <text start="386.18" dur="4.5">have grown by eleven point two six</text>
  <text start="388.13" dur="5.07">trillion since Lehman to fifteen point</text>
  <text start="390.68" dur="4.44">six trillion right now so we can see</text>
  <text start="393.2" dur="4.92">that the central banks they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="395.12" dur="5.4">propping up the stock market making it</text>
  <text start="398.12" dur="4.11">look a lot better than it really is and</text>
  <text start="400.52" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re doing this on purpose just like</text>
  <text start="402.23" dur="3.27">the all the other numbers are</text>
  <text start="403.61" dur="3.6">manipulated they need to keep the</text>
  <text start="405.5" dur="2.19">illusion alive and this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="407.21" dur="4.14">doing</text>
  <text start="407.69" dur="5.88">now we understand that India they were</text>
  <text start="411.35" dur="3.99">this test case where they were going</text>
  <text start="413.57" dur="5.31">after cash and they saying this is a war</text>
  <text start="415.34" dur="6.15">on cash and Indian Prime Minister Modi</text>
  <text start="418.88" dur="4.08">well he launched a surprise attack on</text>
  <text start="421.49" dur="4.77">cash in like twenty sixteen</text>
  <text start="422.96" dur="5.25">he gave the people of India a few days</text>
  <text start="426.26" dur="4.2">to convert the two largest denomination</text>
  <text start="428.21" dur="4.08">bills and they wanted everyone to go</text>
  <text start="430.46" dur="4.35">electronic now was a little difficult to</text>
  <text start="432.29" dur="4.35">do this in this country and they of</text>
  <text start="434.81" dur="3.93">course said well we need to go after</text>
  <text start="436.64" dur="6.65">cash because you know there&amp;#39;s black</text>
  <text start="438.74" dur="7.23">markets there&amp;#39;s drug dealers there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="443.29" dur="5.17">money laundering I mean they just made</text>
  <text start="445.97" dur="7.05">up anything they possibly could and what</text>
  <text start="448.46" dur="7.35">we find out now is that this war on cash</text>
  <text start="453.02" dur="5.97">well it is backfiring right now the</text>
  <text start="455.81" dur="6.33">economy is reeling at this point growth</text>
  <text start="458.99" dur="5.34">has slowed significantly and some</text>
  <text start="462.14" dur="4.98">estimates as many as 5 million jobs have</text>
  <text start="464.33" dur="5.25">been destroyed by the D monetization of</text>
  <text start="467.12" dur="4.8">cash and more and more of the Indian</text>
  <text start="469.58" dur="6.69">people they are becoming very very angry</text>
  <text start="471.92" dur="7.05">so this whole experiment well it is gone</text>
  <text start="476.27" dur="5.85">really really wrong and things are not</text>
  <text start="478.97" dur="5.28">going well in the country we see there</text>
  <text start="482.12" dur="4.64">are additional countries that are</text>
  <text start="484.25" dur="4.65">looking to step away from the dollar</text>
  <text start="486.76" dur="3.46">Venezuela now we know the United States</text>
  <text start="488.9" dur="3.57">is putting a lot of pressure on</text>
  <text start="490.22" dur="3.99">Venezuela they have sanctions they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="492.47" dur="4.2">trying to replace the government they</text>
  <text start="494.21" dur="4.17">want the oil they want to place the</text>
  <text start="496.67" dur="2.82">dollar on their natural resources is</text>
  <text start="498.38" dur="3.48">what they&amp;#39;ve done throughout the Middle</text>
  <text start="499.49" dur="4.53">East and we see right now Maduro said</text>
  <text start="501.86" dur="4.65">that Venezuela will be looking to free</text>
  <text start="504.02" dur="5.07">itself from the US dollar next week</text>
  <text start="506.51" dur="4.44">Maduro will look to the to use the</text>
  <text start="509.09" dur="3.6">weakest of two official foreign exchange</text>
  <text start="510.95" dur="3.93">regimes they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="512.69" dur="4.65">looking at the ruble they might trade in</text>
  <text start="514.88" dur="4.71">the yuan they might even trade in the</text>
  <text start="517.34" dur="4.02">yen and they&amp;#39;re gonna do this where</text>
  <text start="519.59" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re gonna bypass the dollar</text>
  <text start="521.36" dur="3.66">completely now this is not the only</text>
  <text start="523.28" dur="3.39">country that is doing this there are</text>
  <text start="525.02" dur="3.84">other countries that are looking at this</text>
  <text start="526.67" dur="4.92">and we need to remember the BRICS they</text>
  <text start="528.86" dur="5.07">are building their entire economic model</text>
  <text start="531.59" dur="6.72">up we have the belton road and we have</text>
  <text start="533.93" dur="4.89">the oil yujuan gold triad in China right</text>
  <text start="538.31" dur="2.1">now</text>
  <text start="538.82" dur="2.82">so we can see there&amp;#39;s a lot of countries</text>
  <text start="540.41" dur="4.88">looking at this saying you know</text>
  <text start="541.64" dur="5.85">something maybe we can bypass the dollar</text>
  <text start="545.29" dur="5.89">protect ourselves because what do we see</text>
  <text start="547.49" dur="5.58">happening we see the dollar crashing now</text>
  <text start="551.18" dur="2.82">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all this</text>
  <text start="553.07" dur="2.43">and we talked about many different</text>
  <text start="554" dur="4.65">countries that are moving away from the</text>
  <text start="555.5" dur="6.36">dollar we have Iran and South Korea now</text>
  <text start="558.65" dur="4.89">we know Iran has working with China and</text>
  <text start="561.86" dur="3.75">Russia and we know that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="563.54" dur="4.2">completely bypassing the dollar well it</text>
  <text start="565.61" dur="4.14">looks like private lenders from Iran and</text>
  <text start="567.74" dur="5.07">South Korea they&amp;#39;ve signed an agreement</text>
  <text start="569.75" dur="5.72">to cooperate over banking issue with</text>
  <text start="572.81" dur="6.84">each other an agreement which basically</text>
  <text start="575.47" dur="7.69">will bypass the dollar and they&amp;#39;ll deal</text>
  <text start="579.65" dur="6.39">in their own currencies and here we have</text>
  <text start="583.16" dur="4.799">it again where countries are</text>
  <text start="586.04" dur="4.59">moving away from the dollar now all of</text>
  <text start="587.959" dur="6.12">these countries understand that the</text>
  <text start="590.63" dur="4.949">dollar is dying and we can see that</text>
  <text start="594.079" dur="3.57">everything is moving from the west to</text>
  <text start="595.579" dur="3.69">the east and this is just more evidence</text>
  <text start="597.649" dur="4.231">that this is slowly happening now</text>
  <text start="599.269" dur="5.01">remember this doesn&amp;#39;t happen all at once</text>
  <text start="601.88" dur="4.11">because we&amp;#39;ve been following all of this</text>
  <text start="604.279" dur="4.441">for quite a while and as you can see</text>
  <text start="605.99" dur="4.409">this is continually building up I mean</text>
  <text start="608.72" dur="4.41">you can look at this and you can see</text>
  <text start="610.399" dur="4.531">like going back you know a couple of</text>
  <text start="613.13" dur="3.66">years when people said well you have you</text>
  <text start="614.93" dur="4.17">one that will be never in the basket of</text>
  <text start="616.79" dur="4.38">STRs and it was in the basket of STRs</text>
  <text start="619.1" dur="3.419">when we said that China and Russia</text>
  <text start="621.17" dur="2.849">they&amp;#39;re creating their own payment</text>
  <text start="622.519" dur="2.641">system people said no they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="624.019" dur="2.671">to be creating their own payment system</text>
  <text start="625.16" dur="3.239">well they have created their own payment</text>
  <text start="626.69" dur="3.449">system when we said that they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="628.399" dur="4.05">be dealing outside of the dollar well</text>
  <text start="630.139" dur="3.901">guess what they are dealing outside of</text>
  <text start="632.449" dur="3.781">the dollar and we can see that belton</text>
  <text start="634.04" dur="5.25">road is growing more and more countries</text>
  <text start="636.23" dur="4.979">are joining the BRICS the Belton Road</text>
  <text start="639.29" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re dealing outside of the dollar</text>
  <text start="641.209" dur="3.99">because they&amp;#39;re getting prepped and</text>
  <text start="643.19" dur="4.17">ready for what is coming and the</text>
  <text start="645.199" dur="5.041">question is what is coming well we can</text>
  <text start="647.36" dur="5.01">see that the central bank the Cabal they</text>
  <text start="650.24" dur="4.289">are finished right now they&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="652.37" dur="4.8">down this path where they have really</text>
  <text start="654.529" dur="5.61">nothing left and many of the countries</text>
  <text start="657.17" dur="6.419">out there are realizing and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="660.139" dur="7.2">standing up to the sanctions by the</text>
  <text start="663.589" dur="5.911">Cabal the you know the pressures that</text>
  <text start="667.339" dur="4.171">they had once before they are now</text>
  <text start="669.5" dur="3.3">understanding what is going on and they</text>
  <text start="671.51" dur="2.699">are gaining strength and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="672.8" dur="3.18">standing up and saying you know</text>
  <text start="674.209" dur="4.32">something we don&amp;#39;t have to go along with</text>
  <text start="675.98" dur="5.82">this anymore so what this really means</text>
  <text start="678.529" dur="6">is they are almost ready to separate</text>
  <text start="681.8" dur="5.25">themselves from the reserve currency of</text>
  <text start="684.529" dur="4.981">the world and deal in their own</text>
  <text start="687.05" dur="5.519">currencies and this is not a good sign</text>
  <text start="689.51" dur="5.069">for the United States because as we move</text>
  <text start="692.569" dur="4.2">along and the system starts to really</text>
  <text start="694.579" dur="3.421">break down the people here in the United</text>
  <text start="696.769" dur="3.601">States well they&amp;#39;re going to see massive</text>
  <text start="698" dur="3.63">inflation because all those dollars and</text>
  <text start="700.37" dur="2.31">reserves around the world they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="701.63" dur="3.48">to come back the United States it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="702.68" dur="3.959">going to devalue the dollar and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="705.11" dur="3.149">going to see shortages because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="706.639" dur="4.26">really not part of the belt and road</text>
  <text start="708.259" dur="4.38">system that the new trading system we</text>
  <text start="710.899" dur="3.06">can&amp;#39;t place sanctions on countries that</text>
  <text start="712.639" dur="3.3">don&amp;#39;t use the dollar</text>
  <text start="713.959" dur="5.37">we can&amp;#39;t exert pressure on countries</text>
  <text start="715.939" dur="7.2">that don&amp;#39;t use the dollar that trade</text>
  <text start="719.329" dur="5.49">outside of the dollar completely where</text>
  <text start="723.139" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re you know using the Belton Road</text>
  <text start="724.819" dur="4.95">to manufacture products to have trade</text>
  <text start="727.369" dur="6.27">using their own currency the United</text>
  <text start="729.769" dur="7.86">States will be left outside of all of</text>
  <text start="733.639" dur="5.82">this and if this does happen the United</text>
  <text start="737.629" dur="3.06">States will not be able to survive</text>
  <text start="739.459" dur="3.66">because right now we are not a</text>
  <text start="740.689" dur="6.06">manufacturing country we are a service</text>
  <text start="743.119" dur="6.72">country we buy the products from China</text>
  <text start="746.749" dur="4.8">and many other countries yes we export a</text>
  <text start="749.839" dur="5.15">little bit but we bring in a lot more</text>
  <text start="751.549" dur="6.45">and if we stop bringing this stuff in</text>
  <text start="754.989" dur="5.53">guess what happens the shelves are</text>
  <text start="757.999" dur="4.53">completely empty we will not be able to</text>
  <text start="760.519" dur="4.081">make it we are a service country right</text>
  <text start="762.529" dur="4.321">now this is why manufacturing needs to</text>
  <text start="764.6" dur="3.57">come back to the United States and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="766.85" dur="2.039">very difficult because we need to get</text>
  <text start="768.17" dur="2.49">rid of all these trade agreements</text>
  <text start="768.889" dur="3.93">actually we probably should just wipe</text>
  <text start="770.66" dur="4.469">mat just like Trump got rid of the TPP</text>
  <text start="772.819" dur="4.471">he needs to get rid of NAFTA we need to</text>
  <text start="775.129" dur="3.841">start preparing for what is coming and</text>
  <text start="777.29" dur="3.479">we started to do this and then of course</text>
  <text start="778.97" dur="4.589">everything got sidetracked the Cabal is</text>
  <text start="780.769" dur="4.461">pushing and pulling and pushing and</text>
  <text start="783.559" dur="5.01">pulling and putting a lot of pressure on</text>
  <text start="785.23" dur="5.259">the entire system because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="788.569" dur="3.21">want their system to disappear they like</text>
  <text start="790.489" dur="2.91">this system they make a lot of money</text>
  <text start="791.779" dur="3.15">from the system they can control the</text>
  <text start="793.399" dur="3.36">world with the system but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="794.929" dur="3.33">seeing right now is things are really</text>
  <text start="796.759" dur="3.75">deteriorating right now things are</text>
  <text start="798.259" dur="3.99">falling apart things are crashing and</text>
  <text start="800.509" dur="3.51">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen the</text>
  <text start="802.249" dur="3.42">whole system&amp;#39;s going to implode and</text>
  <text start="804.019" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;re gonna go through a transition</text>
  <text start="805.669" dur="4.23">period where it&amp;#39;s gonna be quite rough</text>
