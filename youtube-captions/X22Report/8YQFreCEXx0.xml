  <text start="208.15" dur="6.03">hours after this came out its</text>
  <text start="211.599" dur="5.521">credibility has been called into</text>
  <text start="214.18" dur="5.49">question because the two journalists who</text>
  <text start="217.12" dur="4.8">wrote the story while they gave vastly</text>
  <text start="219.67" dur="7.62">different answers as to whether they had</text>
  <text start="221.92" dur="8.37">actually seen the evidence and one of</text>
  <text start="227.29" dur="6.09">the reporters Jason Leopold he kind of</text>
  <text start="230.29" dur="8.539">has a dubious past he came under fire</text>
  <text start="233.38" dur="7.65">for a 2006 truth out org article</text>
  <text start="238.829" dur="4.99">incorrectly reporting that Karl Rove</text>

  <text start="248.23" dur="6.589">Rove&amp;#39;s indictment is imminent and we</text>
  <text start="251.829" dur="5.431">learned that this wasn&amp;#39;t true whatsoever</text>
  <text start="254.819" dur="5.401">the whole thing was completely fake</text>
  <text start="257.26" dur="6.75">phony and false the other journalists</text>
  <text start="260.22" dur="6.16">Anthony Cormier and made it to CNN&amp;#39;s new</text>
  <text start="264.01" dur="5.67">day that he hadn&amp;#39;t actually seen the</text>
  <text start="266.38" dur="6.06">evidence in the case at all but Leopold</text>
  <text start="269.68" dur="5.359">told msnbc we have seen the documents</text>
  <text start="272.44" dur="6.75">and we&amp;#39;ve been briefed on the documents</text>
  <text start="275.039" dur="6.641">so both individuals who worked on this</text>
  <text start="279.19" dur="5.099">have completely different stories and</text>
  <text start="281.68" dur="6.83">one has one of the reporters has a</text>
  <text start="284.289" dur="6.511">dubious pass of lying about the sources</text>
  <text start="288.51" dur="6.04">does this make any sense</text>
  <text start="290.8" dur="5.94">no it&amp;#39;s called propaganda so Trump</text>
  <text start="294.55" dur="2.94">tweeted out the following reminding</text>
  <text start="296.74" dur="3.929">everyone</text>
  <text start="297.49" dur="6.239">that michael cohen has already been</text>
  <text start="300.669" dur="6.03">convicted of perjury and fraud and as</text>
  <text start="303.729" dur="4.771">recently as this week The Wall Street</text>
  <text start="306.699" dur="3.741">Journal has just said that he may have</text>

  <text start="310.44" dur="6.37">lying to reduce his jail time</text>
  <text start="312.849" dur="5.311">watch father in law so here are the</text>
  <text start="316.81" dur="4.59">problems with this whole story</text>
  <text start="318.16" dur="4.95">BuzzFeed sources are all anonymous right</text>
  <text start="321.4" dur="4.38">there if you have to question the story</text>
  <text start="323.11" dur="5.25">because anonymous sources usually means</text>
  <text start="325.78" dur="5.49">fake propaganda stories but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="328.36" dur="6.54">continue no documentation or evidence is</text>
  <text start="331.27" dur="5.82">provided we all know Cohen is a liar and</text>
  <text start="334.9" dur="4.65">he&amp;#39;ll say anything to save himself right</text>
  <text start="337.09" dur="4.859">now plus Trump just let us know that</text>
  <text start="339.55" dur="4.44">he&amp;#39;s a convicted liar doing business</text>
  <text start="341.949" dur="4.611">with Russia or any other country is not</text>
  <text start="343.99" dur="6.419">illegal you&amp;#39;re allowed to do business</text>
  <text start="346.56" dur="4.919">yes and the Trump Tower project never</text>
  <text start="350.409" dur="4.801">really went anywhere</text>
  <text start="351.479" dur="6.34">it looks like Cohen is just releasing</text>
  <text start="355.21" dur="6.15">these stories and the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="357.819" dur="6.72">the deep state are trying to use them to</text>
  <text start="361.36" dur="5.91">make everyone believe that Trump has</text>
  <text start="364.539" dur="4.41">been colluding with Russia but we know</text>
  <text start="367.27" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s all fake phony and false now</text>
  <text start="368.949" dur="5.641">yesterday fitten tweeted out and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="371.86" dur="4.47">the head of judicial watch that he was</text>
  <text start="374.59" dur="4.049">put to take a series of depositions that</text>
  <text start="376.33" dur="4.95">a federal judge authorized this week to</text>
  <text start="378.639" dur="4.381">explore Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s use of private</text>
  <text start="381.28" dur="4.41">email account and a Secretary of State</text>
  <text start="383.02" dur="5.34">and him and this whole thing has been</text>
  <text start="385.69" dur="6.659">put on ice because of the partial</text>
  <text start="388.36" dur="7.2">government shutdown and US District</text>
  <text start="392.349" dur="4.981">Court Judge Royce Lamberth granted a</text>
  <text start="395.56" dur="4.62">request from Justice Department lawyers</text>
  <text start="397.33" dur="6.089">to put the discovery process on hold</text>
  <text start="400.18" dur="4.68">until after the shutdown so the deep</text>
  <text start="403.419" dur="3.93">state they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="404.86" dur="6.089">possibly can to stall this but again</text>
  <text start="407.349" dur="7.021">it&amp;#39;s a stall tactic which is going to</text>
  <text start="410.949" dur="5.671">expire once the government reopens and</text>
  <text start="414.37" dur="3.87">yes the eventually the government will</text>
  <text start="416.62" dur="3.45">reopen and they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="418.24" dur="6.209">figure out some other way but right now</text>
  <text start="420.07" dur="6.93">they have stalled the depositions that</text>
  <text start="424.449" dur="6.391">Judicial Watch wants to take now</text>
  <text start="427" dur="7.41">yesterday with Trump and ANSI Pelosi</text>
  <text start="430.84" dur="7.35">as we know canceled the flight of pelosi</text>
  <text start="434.41" dur="6.06">and her team they were heading out to</text>
  <text start="438.19" dur="6.24">Afghanistan and many other places and</text>
  <text start="440.47" dur="5.85">they were very angry and they&amp;#39;re pissed</text>
  <text start="444.43" dur="4.56">off and they&amp;#39;re bringing up all these</text>
  <text start="446.32" dur="5.85">different things that Trump his</text>
  <text start="448.99" dur="4.83">administration exposed their itinerary</text>
  <text start="452.17" dur="3.39">and we&amp;#39;ll get into that in just a minute</text>
  <text start="453.82" dur="4.11">but first Trump tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="455.56" dur="4.11">following and he said why would Nancy</text>
  <text start="457.93" dur="3.66">Pelosi leave the country with other</text>
  <text start="459.67" dur="4.44">Democrats on seven day excursion what</text>
  <text start="461.59" dur="4.26">800,000 great people are not getting</text>
  <text start="464.11" dur="4.44">paid also could somebody please explain</text>
  <text start="465.85" dur="4.89">to Nancy and her big donors in one</text>
  <text start="468.55" dur="6.75">country that people working on farms</text>
  <text start="470.74" dur="8.49">grapes will have easy access in so the</text>
  <text start="475.3" dur="7.68">question is what&amp;#39;s so vital about Pelosi</text>
  <text start="479.23" dur="6.27">going to Afghanistan anyway and remember</text>
  <text start="482.98" dur="5.13">Schiff and many other other individuals</text>
  <text start="485.5" dur="4.62">were with her so what is the big rush do</text>
  <text start="488.11" dur="4.44">you really think she&amp;#39;s going out there</text>
  <text start="490.12" dur="5.19">to see the troops and to wish them well</text>
  <text start="492.55" dur="6.63">no they were going out there for a very</text>
  <text start="495.31" dur="10.29">specific reason to meet with deep state</text>
  <text start="499.18" dur="9.33">operatives now Pelosi&amp;#39;s team has blamed</text>
  <text start="505.6" dur="6.15">the White House for leaking sensitive</text>
  <text start="508.51" dur="5.52">travel information now the White House</text>
  <text start="511.75" dur="4.729">came out and said listen that is a</text>
  <text start="514.03" dur="8.16">flat-out lie</text>
  <text start="516.479" dur="8.651">we did not leak anything and the White</text>
  <text start="522.19" dur="4.98">House said the following we rejected the</text>
  <text start="525.13" dur="4.62">accusation from Speaker Nancy Pelosi</text>
  <text start="527.17" dur="4.74">that the administration leaked sensitive</text>
  <text start="529.75" dur="4.95">travel information for her foreign trip</text>
  <text start="531.91" dur="4.26">calling it a flat-out lie when the</text>
  <text start="534.7" dur="3.87">Speaker of the House and about 20 other</text>
  <text start="536.17" dur="3.9">from Capitol Hill decided to book their</text>
  <text start="538.57" dur="4.71">own commercial flights to Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="540.07" dur="4.95">the world is going to find out and this</text>
  <text start="543.28" dur="3.93">is what the White House said which I</text>
  <text start="545.02" dur="5.19">agree if they&amp;#39;re going to go and book</text>
  <text start="547.21" dur="5.07">their flights give their names they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="550.21" dur="4.38">gonna know where they&amp;#39;re flying to it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="552.28" dur="4.26">really not a secret the White House</text>
  <text start="554.59" dur="3.63">continued the idea we would leak</text>
  <text start="556.54" dur="3.27">anything that would put the safety and</text>
  <text start="558.22" dur="4.56">security of any American at risk is a</text>
  <text start="559.81" dur="4.43">flat-out lie now they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="562.78" dur="5.69">a really really big deal</text>
  <text start="564.24" dur="5.61">this but we need to go back in time</text>
  <text start="568.47" dur="5.04">remember yesterday we talked about</text>
  <text start="569.85" dur="9.06">Judicial Watch and they uncovered way</text>
  <text start="573.51" dur="8.639">back in 2010 that Pelosi was abusing</text>
  <text start="578.91" dur="7.11">military travel and using taxpayer money</text>
  <text start="582.149" dur="6.781">to bring members or families aboard</text>
  <text start="586.02" dur="6.87">these planes and serving them top-shelf</text>
  <text start="588.93" dur="8.37">liquor and this is all documented and</text>
  <text start="592.89" dur="7.83">one of policies trips between May 15th</text>
  <text start="597.3" dur="6.659">and May 20th 2008 included Johnnie</text>

  <text start="608.1" dur="6.45">whiskey and the list goes on and on and</text>
  <text start="611.07" dur="6.12">on now and Annan pointed out something</text>
  <text start="614.55" dur="5.52">very interesting about the congressional</text>
  <text start="617.19" dur="4.8">delegation and the Speaker of the House</text>
  <text start="620.07" dur="4.139">and her responsibilities let me just</text>
  <text start="621.99" dur="3.99">read this from the Annin POTUS has made</text>
  <text start="624.209" dur="4.801">a subtle point with regard to Nancy&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="642.87" dur="3.959">if not it is really disingenuous to</text>
  <text start="645.36" dur="4.14">leave the country without making this</text>
  <text start="646.829" dur="4.681">appointment you know here&amp;#39;s the Speaker</text>

  <text start="984.66" dur="4.77">wall he tweeted and the caravan is</text>
  <text start="987.36" dur="6">coming up to the border and I believe</text>
  <text start="989.43" dur="5.64">that Trump would like the caravan to</text>
  <text start="993.36" dur="3.15">come up to the border and this is why</text>
  <text start="995.07" dur="5.97">he&amp;#39;s continually tweeting it out letting</text>
  <text start="996.51" dur="8.28">everyone know that this caravan is the</text>
  <text start="1001.04" dur="7.05">second one since the elections and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1004.79" dur="8.19">making the case of why we need a wall</text>
  <text start="1008.09" dur="6.96">and Soros the deep state they&amp;#39;re playing</text>
  <text start="1012.98" dur="6.21">right into this this will allow him to</text>
  <text start="1015.05" dur="7.71">declare a national emergency now it</text>
  <text start="1019.19" dur="6">looks like Trump is looking to have</text>
  <text start="1022.76" dur="4.5">another meeting with North Korean</text>
  <text start="1025.19" dur="3.899">leaders looks like they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>

  <text start="1029.089" dur="5.161">Young Cheol he is going to be getting</text>
  <text start="1032.06" dur="4.71">together with Trump and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1034.25" dur="6.15">have another summit so the peace deal</text>
  <text start="1036.77" dur="6.96">with North Korea is moving forward now I</text>
  <text start="1040.4" dur="5.66">want to go back to what Pelosi said and</text>
  <text start="1043.73" dur="5.52">when she wrote her letter to Trump about</text>
  <text start="1046.06" dur="6.19">security concerns at the State of the</text>
  <text start="1049.25" dur="5.64">Union and she would like to cancel it</text>
  <text start="1052.25" dur="5.19">and she said he can write into</text>
  <text start="1054.89" dur="4.02">everything that he has to say and we</text>
  <text start="1057.44" dur="3.86">don&amp;#39;t need to have this big production</text>
  <text start="1058.91" dur="6.99">because of security concerns</text>
  <text start="1061.3" dur="7.33">well the question is are they projecting</text>
  <text start="1065.9" dur="5.18">that something might happen if he goes</text>
  <text start="1068.63" dur="5.7">forward with the State of the Union</text>
  <text start="1071.08" dur="5.77">during the shutdown now I know the</text>
  <text start="1074.33" dur="4.37">Secret Service DHS came out and said</text>
  <text start="1076.85" dur="5.97">security is not a problem</text>
  <text start="1078.7" dur="6.64">she waved them off and she says I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1082.82" dur="5.91">care what they said so the question is</text>
  <text start="1085.34" dur="7.68">why is she projecting this out there is</text>
  <text start="1088.73" dur="6.63">she betting on Trump to go ahead with</text>
  <text start="1093.02" dur="2.88">the State of the Union now according to</text>
  <text start="1095.36" dur="3.24">the</text>
  <text start="1095.9" dur="5.16">institution section 3 of the</text>
  <text start="1098.6" dur="6.03">Constitution and if we look at this it</text>
  <text start="1101.06" dur="7.08">gives the president the authority to</text>
  <text start="1104.63" dur="7.32">give the State of the Union now if she</text>
  <text start="1108.14" dur="6.09">betting on Trump saying you&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="1111.95" dur="4.47">tell me what to do I am going to give</text>
  <text start="1114.23" dur="4.65">the State of the Union and this is why</text>
  <text start="1116.42" dur="6.45">she waved off DHS and Secret Service</text>
  <text start="1118.88" dur="6.6">because they have an event planned where</text>
  <text start="1122.87" dur="4.89">they can say we warned him and something</text>
  <text start="1125.48" dur="6">happens where maybe somebody takes a</text>
  <text start="1127.76" dur="6.93">shot or they kill him assassinate him</text>
  <text start="1131.48" dur="5.64">where something happens and we can see</text>
  <text start="1134.69" dur="4.92">that she said this on purpose this is</text>
  <text start="1137.12" dur="4.05">just not about hey you know what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1139.61" dur="3.63">canceling this because of the shutdown</text>
  <text start="1141.17" dur="5.43">because you won&amp;#39;t negotiate this is</text>
  <text start="1143.24" dur="6.63">projecting something out there and this</text>
  <text start="1146.6" dur="6.06">is why she&amp;#39;s waving off DHS and the</text>
  <text start="1149.87" dur="5.87">Secret Service so this is something that</text>
  <text start="1152.66" dur="7.08">we need to watch and be aware of now</text>
  <text start="1155.74" dur="5.95">blueprint q kind of laid out what is</text>
  <text start="1159.74" dur="3.87">happening and I think it makes a lot of</text>
