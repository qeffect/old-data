  <text start="151.73" dur="5.1">financial crash and would unleash a</text>
  <text start="154.15" dur="6.91">property crash that could see house</text>

  <text start="206.15" dur="6.84">we&amp;#39;ll see high inflation high interest</text>
  <text start="210.05" dur="6.6">rates and this is all going to happen</text>
  <text start="212.99" dur="5.27">because of the hard or No Deal brexit no</text>
  <text start="216.65" dur="5.88">this is all going to happen because</text>
  <text start="218.26" dur="7.99">their system is designed to crash now</text>
  <text start="222.53" dur="5.58">they have no out right now so it looks</text>
  <text start="226.25" dur="6.6">like what they&amp;#39;re saying is listen if</text>
  <text start="228.11" dur="6.99">you vote away from the EU this is going</text>
  <text start="232.85" dur="3.81">to happen you know it&amp;#39;s funny if they</text>
  <text start="235.1" dur="2.78">stayed with the EU it was going to</text>
  <text start="236.66" dur="4.29">happen no matter what</text>
  <text start="237.88" dur="4.9">then they then Mark Carney was asked</text>
  <text start="240.95" dur="3.63">about the banking system and he said</text>
  <text start="242.78" dur="3.24">well yeah the economy&amp;#39;s gonna crash but</text>
  <text start="244.58" dur="3.24">the banks will be fine because we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="246.02" dur="3.9">done stress tests on them so wait a</text>
  <text start="247.82" dur="3.63">minute the banks will be fine they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="249.92" dur="4.38">gonna weather the storm but everything</text>
  <text start="251.45" dur="4.83">else is going to crash it&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="254.3" dur="3.54">ridiculous and we could see right now</text>
  <text start="256.28" dur="3.45">the central bankers are becoming very</text>
  <text start="257.84" dur="4.52">very desperate because they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="259.73" dur="6.45">an out right now they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="262.36" dur="6.55">anywhere to blame what is about to</text>
  <text start="266.18" dur="4.44">happen in the global economy yes they</text>
  <text start="268.91" dur="4.11">can blame the brexit but that&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="270.62" dur="4.47">little isolated area they&amp;#39;re gonna try</text>
  <text start="273.02" dur="4.5">to blame Trump but it looks like Trump</text>
  <text start="275.09" dur="4.23">has building the economy up to all-time</text>
  <text start="277.52" dur="3.72">highs that it&amp;#39;s gonna be very very</text>
  <text start="279.32" dur="5.099">difficult to say yeah his tariffs did</text>
  <text start="281.24" dur="5.73">this or his tax deal did this because</text>
  <text start="284.419" dur="7.201">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is these statistical</text>
  <text start="286.97" dur="6">numbers that are unbelievable he&amp;#39;s taken</text>
  <text start="291.62" dur="3.6">it to the next level</text>
  <text start="292.97" dur="3.81">I mean they&amp;#39;ve done manipulation before</text>
  <text start="295.22" dur="5.16">but he&amp;#39;s taking what they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="296.78" dur="6.42">brought it up to the next level this way</text>
  <text start="300.38" dur="5.13">they can&amp;#39;t say anything it&amp;#39;s being done</text>
  <text start="303.2" dur="3.57">on purpose but when we look at the</text>
  <text start="305.51" dur="3.12">people&amp;#39;s economy and we look at the</text>
  <text start="306.77" dur="2.91">economy all around us we can see that</text>
  <text start="308.63" dur="3.93">things are really starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="309.68" dur="4.71">quite quickly and I believe Trump of the</text>
  <text start="312.56" dur="4.35">Patriots know that this economy is not</text>
  <text start="314.39" dur="4.8">going to last much longer they know that</text>
  <text start="316.91" dur="3.39">the stock markets in a bubble they know</text>
  <text start="319.19" dur="3.21">that everything is minute</text>
  <text start="320.3" dur="5.19">they know what the central bank has done</text>
  <text start="322.4" dur="4.74">they know where all this money has been</text>
  <text start="325.49" dur="4.92">going they&amp;#39;ve been tracking it down all</text>
  <text start="327.14" dur="6.03">this time and we can see with retail and</text>
  <text start="330.41" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at retail quite a bit</text>
  <text start="333.17" dur="5.51">and we&amp;#39;ve been looking at retail way</text>
  <text start="335.3" dur="5.76">before the retail apocalypse way before</text>
  <text start="338.68" dur="5.17">stores were even closing we were</text>
  <text start="341.06" dur="5.28">reporting on how each holiday season</text>
  <text start="343.85" dur="6.96">sales were dropping dropping dropping</text>
  <text start="346.34" dur="7.53">and stores or struggling and at the time</text>
  <text start="350.81" dur="5.85">how did the mainstream media explain</text>
  <text start="353.87" dur="5.43">this all away that he used the weather</text>
  <text start="356.66" dur="5.73">of course I mean if they saw a snowstorm</text>
  <text start="359.3" dur="4.89">in January or February or December it</text>
  <text start="362.39" dur="4.59">was because of all the snow but remember</text>
  <text start="364.19" dur="5.94">the snow only happened in an isolated</text>
  <text start="366.98" dur="5.55">area maybe it happened in New York maybe</text>
  <text start="370.13" dur="5.96">it happened in New Jersey but the rest</text>
  <text start="372.53" dur="6">of the country they were not seeing snow</text>
  <text start="376.09" dur="3.64">well they used the weather up to a</text>
  <text start="378.53" dur="2.82">certain point where they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="379.73" dur="4.5">explain it anymore because during the</text>
  <text start="381.35" dur="5.16">nice weather when it was sunny or we had</text>
  <text start="384.23" dur="3.87">a winter where we didn&amp;#39;t have that much</text>
  <text start="386.51" dur="4.47">snow during the holiday season or</text>
  <text start="388.1" dur="4.53">January yes it was very cold but it was</text>
  <text start="390.98" dur="3.69">getting harder and harder to explain why</text>
  <text start="392.63" dur="3.54">more and more stores were struggling and</text>
  <text start="394.67" dur="3.99">a lot of stores were starting to shut</text>
  <text start="396.17" dur="4.68">down so then they moved their whole</text>
  <text start="398.66" dur="4.59">entire argument to online sales now I</text>
  <text start="400.85" dur="4.65">remember when I was younger we had</text>
  <text start="403.25" dur="3.66">catalogs you can get a catalog delivered</text>
  <text start="405.5" dur="2.82">to your house you&amp;#39;d have all the</text>
  <text start="406.91" dur="3.12">pictures there you can order by phone</text>
  <text start="408.32" dur="4.53">and they thought this was going to be</text>
  <text start="410.03" dur="6.27">the next thing they thought the catalog</text>
  <text start="412.85" dur="4.86">shopping was going to be a revolution</text>
  <text start="416.3" dur="3.78">where everyone was going to do it you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="417.71" dur="4.62">just gonna get a catalog at home and you</text>
  <text start="420.08" dur="4.14">were going to order your stuff a member</text>
  <text start="422.33" dur="4.05">of the Sears catalog it was very thick</text>
  <text start="424.22" dur="3.05">and big and everyone was gonna order in</text>
  <text start="426.38" dur="3.96">that fashion</text>
  <text start="427.27" dur="6.04">well isn&amp;#39;t that what the internet is one</text>
  <text start="430.34" dur="6">big gigantic catalog where you can order</text>
  <text start="433.31" dur="4.68">and have it delivered and they thought</text>
  <text start="436.34" dur="4.62">back then that retail stores were gonna</text>
  <text start="437.99" dur="5.37">go away it was pretty much that was it</text>
  <text start="440.96" dur="6.3">everyone was gonna use catalogs instead</text>
  <text start="443.36" dur="5.67">and that didn&amp;#39;t happen what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="447.26" dur="3.69">right now is they&amp;#39;re trying to figure</text>
  <text start="449.03" dur="3.18">out a way to explain what is happening</text>
  <text start="450.95" dur="2.86">in the economy they&amp;#39;ve been trying to do</text>
  <text start="452.21" dur="3.55">this for quite a while</text>
  <text start="453.81" dur="4.68">and what&amp;#39;s been happening is the people</text>
  <text start="455.76" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;ve been losing jobs the high-paying</text>
  <text start="458.49" dur="5.899">jobs are disappearing the jobs that we</text>
  <text start="461.4" dur="5.94">once knew of with manufacturing</text>
  <text start="464.389" dur="4.241">high-paying jobs they&amp;#39;re disappearing</text>
  <text start="467.34" dur="4.11">and they&amp;#39;ve been disappearing quicker</text>
  <text start="468.63" dur="4.74">and quicker as each year passes which</text>
  <text start="471.45" dur="5.13">means a lot of people don&amp;#39;t have extra</text>
  <text start="473.37" dur="6.33">funds to go out shopping this is why we</text>
  <text start="476.58" dur="5.73">see a drop in food stores this is why we</text>
  <text start="479.7" dur="4.38">see a drop in restaurants this is why we</text>
  <text start="482.31" dur="4.23">see stores closing</text>
  <text start="484.08" dur="6.38">I mean Sears right now they are doing</text>
  <text start="486.54" dur="8.7">absolutely awful sears they&amp;#39;re on track</text>
  <text start="490.46" dur="6.4">for zero sales by 2020 and mostly all</text>
  <text start="495.24" dur="6.29">their store is going to be shutting down</text>
  <text start="496.86" dur="7.17">and at the end of 2017 Sears had about</text>
  <text start="501.53" dur="4.59">1,250 stores at the end of the second</text>
  <text start="504.03" dur="6.93">quarter of 2018 the count was down by</text>
  <text start="506.12" dur="7.51">384 stores to 866 and we could see that</text>
  <text start="510.96" dur="4.59">it is happening very very quickly and if</text>
  <text start="513.63" dur="6.27">you look at this you can see the trend</text>
  <text start="515.55" dur="6.51">is going to zero by 2020 2021</text>
  <text start="519.9" dur="4.35">where Sears most likely will have no</text>
  <text start="522.06" dur="4.68">stores whatsoever and most likely they</text>
  <text start="524.25" dur="3.589">will just close up shop way before that</text>
  <text start="526.74" dur="3.81">because they won&amp;#39;t be able to operate</text>
  <text start="527.839" dur="5.351">but when we look at retail sales we can</text>
  <text start="530.55" dur="4.83">see retail sales they are not doing that</text>
  <text start="533.19" dur="4.47">well yes we have little bump ups here</text>
  <text start="535.38" dur="5.34">and there but overall retail sales have</text>
  <text start="537.66" dur="5.73">been dropping I mean retail sales were</text>
  <text start="540.72" dur="5.88">expected to come in at 0.5% and they</text>
  <text start="543.39" dur="6.21">came in at point 1 percent and what</text>
  <text start="546.6" dur="5.76">happened here well we see that food</text>
  <text start="549.6" dur="6.239">services auto dealers building material&amp;#39;</text>
  <text start="552.36" dur="6.93">stores gas elation stations it only rose</text>
  <text start="555.839" dur="5.281">by 0.1 percent far below the point 5</text>
  <text start="559.29" dur="4.44">percent that they thought was going to</text>
  <text start="561.12" dur="4.469">happen and we can see that sales are</text>
  <text start="563.73" dur="3.87">continually dropping now if we look at</text>
  <text start="565.589" dur="4.651">the number of stores that have closed I</text>
  <text start="567.6" dur="5.76">mean it is unbelievable and remember all</text>
  <text start="570.24" dur="6.51">these stores have catalogs they have an</text>
  <text start="573.36" dur="4.86">internet presence on I mean they have</text>
  <text start="576.75" dur="3.6">websites on the internet they have a</text>
  <text start="578.22" dur="4.65">presence there people do go shopping</text>
  <text start="580.35" dur="4.17">using this so they have the best of both</text>
  <text start="582.87" dur="4.05">worlds they have a retail shop</text>
  <text start="584.52" dur="3.09">they have online sales but these stores</text>

  <text start="811.93" dur="6.27">seeing today and this is what the</text>
  <text start="815.22" dur="5.44">establishment is so afraid of the</text>
  <text start="818.2" dur="4.59">central banks are afraid they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="820.66" dur="4.89">you to get rid of them they have</text>
  <text start="822.79" dur="6.78">embedded themselves into the world not</text>
  <text start="825.55" dur="7.89">just the US the world and what they fear</text>
  <text start="829.57" dur="5.58">is that they will be obsolete people</text>
  <text start="833.44" dur="4.02">will figure out what they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="835.15" dur="4.71">all this time this is why they demonize</text>
  <text start="837.46" dur="4.5">gold and silver this is why they</text>
  <text start="839.86" dur="3.75">demonize the crypto market they brought</text>
  <text start="841.96" dur="4.44">the crypto market right down to the</text>
  <text start="843.61" dur="4.95">level of gold and silver this was done</text>
  <text start="846.4" dur="3.84">on purpose actually if you listen to the</text>
  <text start="848.56" dur="5.28">interview with Jeff Nielsen going back a</text>
  <text start="850.24" dur="4.8">couple of months we discussed this how</text>
  <text start="853.84" dur="2.88">they were building</text>
  <text start="855.04" dur="4.77">Bitcoin and they were going to dump</text>
  <text start="856.72" dur="5.55">Bitcoin to make it look just like</text>
  <text start="859.81" dur="4.8">precious metals where they take paper</text>
  <text start="862.27" dur="4.47">contracts they dump it and say nothing</text>
  <text start="864.61" dur="4.08">to see here our system is the only</text>
  <text start="866.74" dur="5.49">system this is what they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="868.69" dur="6.33">throughout history they&amp;#39;re very nervous</text>
  <text start="872.23" dur="5.73">and afraid and now there&amp;#39;s a wild card</text>
  <text start="875.02" dur="6.9">in the White House and if the Fed goes</text>
  <text start="877.96" dur="6.87">and China and Russia don&amp;#39;t cooperate</text>
  <text start="881.92" dur="3.9">with the IMF or the biz and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="884.83" dur="2.34">want to have anything to do with them</text>
  <text start="885.82" dur="3.66">and they&amp;#39;re going to use their own</text>
  <text start="887.17" dur="5.07">national currencies taking control of</text>
  <text start="889.48" dur="3.33">their own system think about what that</text>
  <text start="892.24" dur="2.72">means</text>
  <text start="892.81" dur="5.31">forget about moving away from the dollar</text>
  <text start="894.96" dur="7.21">if everyone decides to use their</text>
  <text start="898.12" dur="8.28">national currencies and not use you know</text>
  <text start="902.17" dur="7.86">the Euro and not use a global currency</text>
  <text start="906.4" dur="5.31">but their own currency by taking control</text>
  <text start="910.03" dur="5.73">of their private western central bank</text>
  <text start="911.71" dur="7.35">and removing those central bankers what</text>
  <text start="915.76" dur="7.14">happens to the central bank it ceases to</text>
