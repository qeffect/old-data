  <text start="89.09" dur="4.919">down the central bank&amp;#39;s system and there</text>
  <text start="91.909" dur="4.38">are many individuals working on this</text>
  <text start="94.009" dur="4.53">with Trump and the Patriots and we know</text>
  <text start="96.289" dur="4.95">the central bankers they&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="98.539" dur="4.351">very difficult time trying to control</text>
  <text start="101.239" dur="5.281">the narrative now remember their whole</text>
  <text start="102.89" dur="6.539">game their whole mission is to control</text>
  <text start="106.52" dur="4.379">countries to control the people and they</text>
  <text start="109.429" dur="3.901">thought they&amp;#39;d be able to do this with</text>
  <text start="110.899" dur="6.151">the brexit to make sure that no other</text>
  <text start="113.33" dur="9.569">country left their system and it looks</text>
  <text start="117.05" dur="8.97">like the lies have been exposed now we</text>
  <text start="122.899" dur="4.411">know the brexit was voted on the people</text>
  <text start="126.02" dur="4.32">said you know something we want to be</text>
  <text start="127.31" dur="4.83">separate and apart from the EU we knew</text>
  <text start="130.34" dur="5.759">the central bankers were never going to</text>
  <text start="132.14" dur="7.38">accept this well we find out that</text>
  <text start="136.099" dur="6.961">Theresa May she refused to publish the</text>
  <text start="139.52" dur="6.48">complete legal analysis of the agreement</text>
  <text start="143.06" dur="7.86">she signed and the leaked analysis</text>
  <text start="146" dur="7.16">proves she lied now this is the part</text>
  <text start="150.92" dur="6.3">which she didn&amp;#39;t want out there</text>
  <text start="153.16" dur="7">no individual member state has a veto</text>
  <text start="157.22" dur="5.76">however member states are very likely to</text>
  <text start="160.16" dur="3.81">have a veto over any future arrangement</text>
  <text start="162.98" dur="2.85">agreement</text>
  <text start="163.97" dur="5.25">rating the possibility that a member</text>
  <text start="165.83" dur="6.99">state disgruntled at the W a could</text>
  <text start="169.22" dur="5.31">decide in the future to veto the FAA</text>
  <text start="172.82" dur="7.32">which is the future arrangements</text>
  <text start="174.53" dur="8.37">agreement so back on November 26 Trump</text>
  <text start="180.14" dur="4.77">proclaim the brexit agreement sounds</text>
  <text start="182.9" dur="6.81">like a great deal for the EU and we knew</text>
  <text start="184.91" dur="6.6">it was weighted towards the EU not</text>
  <text start="189.71" dur="4.59">towards the people who voted for the</text>
  <text start="191.51" dur="4.38">brexit and Trump came out and said yeah</text>
  <text start="194.3" dur="3.15">this does not look like a good deal</text>
  <text start="195.89" dur="4.02">actually yesterday we talked about</text>
  <text start="197.45" dur="5.009">Jeremy Corbyn he said this is going to</text>
  <text start="199.91" dur="6.57">make it a lot worse off for the people</text>
  <text start="202.459" dur="7.171">of the UK and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="206.48" dur="4.92">Theresa May refused over a week to post</text>
  <text start="209.63" dur="4.8">a legal review of the brexit arrangement</text>
  <text start="211.4" dur="5.76">she signed instead she posted allegedly</text>
  <text start="214.43" dur="7.2">sufficient excerpts on which Parliament</text>
  <text start="217.16" dur="7.71">could make a decision now here is the</text>
  <text start="221.63" dur="5.49">leaked commons legal analysis of the</text>
  <text start="224.87" dur="4.47">brexit deal which completely vindicates</text>
  <text start="227.12" dur="5.7">what Trump said which indicates almost</text>
  <text start="229.34" dur="8.16">what everyone said about where this deal</text>
  <text start="232.82" dur="8.639">stands and who it benefits here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="237.5" dur="6.03">first part the note mark not for general</text>
  <text start="241.459" dur="5.101">distribution and attained by brexit</text>
  <text start="243.53" dur="5.88">central is dated November 26 and states</text>
  <text start="246.56" dur="5.55">that the UK EU customs union which would</text>
  <text start="249.41" dur="4.889">come into effect if the backstop is</text>
  <text start="252.11" dur="3.93">triggered would be a practical barrier</text>
  <text start="254.299" dur="3.631">to the UK entering separate trade</text>
  <text start="256.04" dur="3.81">Arrangements on goods with third</text>
  <text start="257.93" dur="4.41">countries this is in direct</text>
  <text start="259.85" dur="4.77">contradiction to the prime minister who</text>
  <text start="262.34" dur="4.56">has insisted that her deal will allow</text>
  <text start="264.62" dur="5.7">the UK to have an entirely independent</text>
  <text start="266.9" dur="5.93">trade policy the legal note also appears</text>
  <text start="270.32" dur="6.09">to suggest that Prime Minister&amp;#39;s claim</text>
  <text start="272.83" dur="5.77">that her deal takes back control of our</text>
  <text start="276.41" dur="4.86">laws by ending the jurisdiction of the</text>
  <text start="278.6" dur="4.68">European Court of Justice in the UK with</text>
  <text start="281.27" dur="4.77">our laws being made in our Parliament</text>
  <text start="283.28" dur="5">enforced by our courts does not entirely</text>
  <text start="286.04" dur="7.17">stand up to scrutiny</text>
  <text start="288.28" dur="8.98">basically Theresa May lied</text>
  <text start="293.21" dur="6.66">the control is with the EU and this is</text>
  <text start="297.26" dur="5.13">why the EU is out there threatening the</text>
  <text start="299.87" dur="5.49">people saying this is a great deal you</text>
  <text start="302.39" dur="7.01">better accept it or else and this is how</text>
  <text start="305.36" dur="7.5">you know that this is not a good deal</text>
  <text start="309.4" dur="6.82">the central bankers were just exposed</text>
  <text start="312.86" dur="7.86">Theresa May is in line with the central</text>
  <text start="316.22" dur="6.42">bankers as you can see those people who</text>
  <text start="320.72" dur="3.72">profit from the central bankers who take</text>
  <text start="322.64" dur="4.95">orders from the central bankers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="324.44" dur="5.7">not working for the people but this is</text>
  <text start="327.59" dur="4.5">all changing around the world why do you</text>
  <text start="330.14" dur="4.47">why do you think we see protests in</text>
  <text start="332.09" dur="4.68">France Germany Sweden which will</text>
  <text start="334.61" dur="5.49">beginning to that later in the next</text>
  <text start="336.77" dur="7.95">report but there is change coming to</text>
  <text start="340.1" dur="7.11">this world and nothing can stop it Trump</text>
  <text start="344.72" dur="5.58">tweeted out the following with President</text>
  <text start="347.21" dur="6.6">Xi president G and I have a strong and</text>
  <text start="350.3" dur="4.56">personal relationship he and I are the</text>
  <text start="353.81" dur="3.33">only two people that can bring about</text>
  <text start="354.86" dur="5.58">massive and very positive change on</text>
  <text start="357.14" dur="6">trade and far beyond between our two</text>
  <text start="360.44" dur="6.27">great nations a solution for North Korea</text>
  <text start="363.14" dur="6.06">is a great thing for China and all think</text>
  <text start="366.71" dur="5.6">about what he just said here China and</text>
  <text start="369.2" dur="8">the United States can bring about</text>
  <text start="372.31" dur="7.54">massive and very positive change</text>
  <text start="377.2" dur="4.57">Trump is already signaling that</text>
  <text start="379.85" dur="4.2">everything is about to change everything</text>
  <text start="381.77" dur="4.56">is about to change with the central bank</text>

  <text start="386.33" dur="5.64">know it today with the economy how do we</text>
  <text start="389.9" dur="4.14">know that things are changing how do we</text>
  <text start="391.97" dur="3.36">know that this is true</text>
  <text start="394.04" dur="4.68">well we&amp;#39;re starting to see a lot of</text>
  <text start="395.33" dur="5.25">countries maneuver away from the dollar</text>
  <text start="398.72" dur="3.57">now why do you think they&amp;#39;re maneuvering</text>
  <text start="400.58" dur="4.5">away from the dollar why do you think</text>
  <text start="402.29" dur="4.56">Russia China they&amp;#39;ve been moving away</text>
  <text start="405.08" dur="4.11">from the dot now we need to go back in</text>
  <text start="406.85" dur="5.52">time a little bit and understand that</text>
  <text start="409.19" dur="5.97">the central bankers they had a different</text>
  <text start="412.37" dur="6.6">plan altogether they were planning on</text>
  <text start="415.16" dur="8.22">this major event which was war to</text>
  <text start="418.97" dur="6.99">explain away why we have to tighten our</text>
  <text start="423.38" dur="3.35">belts why you&amp;#39;re not seeing food on the</text>
  <text start="425.96" dur="3.03">shelves</text>
  <text start="426.73" dur="3.49">and there are many other agendas</text>
  <text start="428.99" dur="2.73">associated with war with you know</text>
  <text start="430.22" dur="4.19">reducing the population and things like</text>
  <text start="431.72" dur="8.13">that so they can we start their system</text>
  <text start="434.41" dur="8.52">now they have a problem now their plan</text>
  <text start="439.85" dur="7.53">is out the window and you can see that</text>
  <text start="442.93" dur="6.82">Trump Xi Jinping and Putin they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="447.38" dur="5.28">working together to remove the central</text>
  <text start="449.75" dur="5.76">bank now what has Russia and China been</text>
  <text start="452.66" dur="6.81">doing now in the beginning China they</text>
  <text start="455.51" dur="6.38">were preparing to take on the reserve</text>
  <text start="459.47" dur="7.11">currency or to be the powerhouse of the</text>
  <text start="461.89" dur="7">new economic system the central bank was</text>
  <text start="466.58" dur="7.08">going to move in on this and control the</text>
  <text start="468.89" dur="8.73">entire system and now it seems that Xi</text>
  <text start="473.66" dur="6.78">Jinping has broken free of that Putin</text>
  <text start="477.62" dur="4.08">has already taken over his private</text>
  <text start="480.44" dur="4.65">western central bank they have hardly</text>
  <text start="481.7" dur="8.76">any debt and right now Trump is</text>
  <text start="485.09" dur="10.05">signaling that positive change is coming</text>
  <text start="490.46" dur="6.54">not a trade war not a real war but</text>
  <text start="495.14" dur="3.99">everything that we know as what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="497" dur="5.13">seeing today is going to change now we</text>
  <text start="499.13" dur="5.34">know that China and Russia they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="502.13" dur="4.8">working to set up their own payment</text>
  <text start="504.47" dur="4.32">system they set up their own trade</text>
  <text start="506.93" dur="3.75">systems they&amp;#39;re moving away from the</text>
  <text start="508.79" dur="3.9">dollar eventually all countries were</text>
  <text start="510.68" dur="3.93">going to move away from the dollar now</text>
  <text start="512.69" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re gonna move away because they</text>
  <text start="514.61" dur="5.13">knew that war was coming and a new</text>
  <text start="517.01" dur="5.55">system was being developed today they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="519.74" dur="5.58">moving away for a completely different</text>
  <text start="522.56" dur="7.17">reason the reason is is that the central</text>
  <text start="525.32" dur="7.38">bank Federal note it&amp;#39;s dying and now the</text>
  <text start="529.73" dur="5.85">European Commission has reportedly form</text>
  <text start="532.7" dur="6.75">a formulated a plan to reduce the role</text>
  <text start="535.58" dur="6.45">of a dollar in international trade all</text>
  <text start="539.45" dur="4.59">the leaders around the world understand</text>
  <text start="542.03" dur="4.95">that the Federal Reserve is it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="544.04" dur="6.21">to fail the Federal Reserve fails the</text>
  <text start="546.98" dur="5.19">Federal note goes with it at federal</text>
  <text start="550.25" dur="3.66">note goes with it so does the petro</text>
  <text start="552.17" dur="3.81">dollar we see what&amp;#39;s happening out in</text>
  <text start="553.91" dur="4.17">the Middle East things are changing very</text>
  <text start="555.98" dur="4.33">rapidly the D State has lost complete</text>
  <text start="558.08" dur="4.299">control out in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="560.31" dur="4.62">so right now the European Commission</text>
  <text start="562.379" dur="4.14">they decided to move away because they</text>
  <text start="564.93" dur="3.63">know they can&amp;#39;t stay with the dollar</text>
  <text start="566.519" dur="3.601">most of the countries can&amp;#39;t stay with</text>
  <text start="568.56" dur="4.259">the dollar they already know that this</text>
  <text start="570.12" dur="4.829">was planned but they were gonna do it</text>
  <text start="572.819" dur="3.361">under the cover of night of war and no</text>
  <text start="574.949" dur="3.39">one really would have noticed what was</text>
  <text start="576.18" dur="5.759">really going on now it&amp;#39;s out in the</text>
  <text start="578.339" dur="5.011">public people see it happening so right</text>
  <text start="581.939" dur="4.471">now they&amp;#39;re saying that Member States</text>
  <text start="583.35" dur="6.239">should promote wider use of the euro in</text>
  <text start="586.41" dur="8.849">relations with third countries in field</text>
  <text start="589.589" dur="9.36">of energy hmm this is another indicator</text>
  <text start="595.259" dur="5">to let you know everything is about to</text>
  <text start="598.949" dur="4.26">change</text>
  <text start="600.259" dur="5.77">so the Commission calls on member states</text>
  <text start="603.209" dur="5.641">to include in their intergovernmental</text>
  <text start="606.029" dur="4.41">agreements with third countries a Model</text>
  <text start="608.85" dur="4.2">Clause developed by the Commission</text>

  <text start="613.05" dur="5.88">default currency to participants in</text>
  <text start="616.92" dur="4.74">European energy markets should use more</text>
  <text start="618.93" dur="6.69">energy related contracts denominated in</text>

  <text start="657.6" dur="4.859">the late seventeen 50s it was France</text>
  <text start="660.12" dur="3.149">then if you move into the 1800&amp;#39;s into</text>
