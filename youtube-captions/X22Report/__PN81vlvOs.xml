  <text start="146.3" dur="5.61">was gonna be used for they had no clue</text>
  <text start="148.79" dur="5.4">and then all of a sudden everyone was</text>
  <text start="151.91" dur="4.62">using it the same things happening with</text>
  <text start="154.19" dur="3.48">cryptocurrencies people hear things on</text>
  <text start="156.53" dur="2.94">the corporate media but they really</text>
  <text start="157.67" dur="5.459">don&amp;#39;t understand what it really is now</text>
  <text start="159.47" dur="6.06">out of the Wall Street Journal they put</text>
  <text start="163.129" dur="4.321">up an article where they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="165.53" dur="4.679">terrorists are using Bitcoin for</text>
  <text start="167.45" dur="5.819">anonymous donations and they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="170.209" dur="4.591">this whole entire case that terrorist</text>
  <text start="173.269" dur="5.131">groups are beginning to take advantage</text>
  <text start="174.8" dur="5.749">of the anonymity of cryptocurrency to</text>
  <text start="178.4" dur="4.38">raise funds to carry out attacks</text>
  <text start="180.549" dur="4.47">according to the report terror</text>
  <text start="182.78" dur="3.99">organizations such as the North Syrian</text>
  <text start="185.019" dur="3.641">military group</text>
  <text start="186.77" dur="5.03">used Twitter to encourage supporters to</text>
  <text start="188.66" dur="5.97">donate cryptocurrency anonymously and</text>
  <text start="191.8" dur="5.47">they keep going on and on about this</text>
  <text start="194.63" dur="5.37">saying that yes the blockchain is made</text>
  <text start="197.27" dur="6.06">up of Ledger&amp;#39;s and people can stay</text>
  <text start="200" dur="5.76">anonymous and they&amp;#39;re using this type of</text>
  <text start="203.33" dur="4.92">function to support their terror</text>
  <text start="205.76" dur="6.81">activities and they never really</text>
  <text start="208.25" dur="8.28">mentioned that cash is also used for</text>
  <text start="212.57" dur="6.47">this banks are also laundering money</text>
  <text start="216.53" dur="5.52">there&amp;#39;s already been cases against HSBC</text>
  <text start="219.04" dur="6.94">terror organizations crime syndicates</text>
  <text start="222.05" dur="7.26">have been using cash all along to push</text>
  <text start="225.98" dur="4.92">their criminal activities so their case</text>
  <text start="229.31" dur="4.59">doesn&amp;#39;t really make sense but what</text>
  <text start="230.9" dur="7.29">they&amp;#39;re trying to say is that the</text>
  <text start="233.9" dur="6.69">blockchain system without relying on the</text>
  <text start="238.19" dur="3.83">banks or exchanges or some type of</text>
  <text start="240.59" dur="4.31">entity that&amp;#39;s centrally controlled</text>
  <text start="242.02" dur="5.41">you&amp;#39;re going to have this type of</text>
  <text start="244.9" dur="4.21">problem now they&amp;#39;re doing this on</text>
  <text start="247.43" dur="4.89">purpose because they realize how quickly</text>
  <text start="249.11" dur="4.95">this can move and really take over the</text>
  <text start="252.32" dur="2.79">currency system that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="254.06" dur="4.739">really worried about now think about</text>
  <text start="255.11" dur="6.81">this us Olympians they&amp;#39;ve turned to</text>
  <text start="258.799" dur="5.581">Bitcoin to offset their competition</text>
  <text start="261.92" dur="5.01">related costs because everything costs a</text>
  <text start="264.38" dur="5.13">lot of money they realized if they</text>
  <text start="266.93" dur="4.23">invest in Bitcoin Bitcoin has been going</text>
  <text start="269.51" dur="4.29">up yes it&amp;#39;s come down a little bit and</text>
  <text start="271.16" dur="4.95">it goes right back up they can make some</text>
  <text start="273.8" dur="4.38">money and they can use this to offset</text>
  <text start="276.11" dur="5.16">some of their costs and we see right now</text>
  <text start="278.18" dur="6.63">the luge team out in the current</text>
  <text start="281.27" dur="6.57">Olympics they&amp;#39;ve been using Bitcoin to</text>
  <text start="284.81" dur="5.13">basically allow them to do all the</text>
  <text start="287.84" dur="5.87">things they need to do to get to the</text>
  <text start="289.94" dur="8.1">Olympics and we see right now we have</text>
  <text start="293.71" dur="7.99">individuals corporations countries all</text>
  <text start="298.04" dur="5.97">moving to the crypto market the reason</text>
  <text start="301.7" dur="5.25">for this is because they realize how</text>
  <text start="304.01" dur="5.46">easy it is to establish I mean think</text>
  <text start="306.95" dur="4.17">about everyone has a computer a everyone</text>
  <text start="309.47" dur="3.66">pretty much has a some type of</text>
  <text start="311.12" dur="4.44">smartphone if you&amp;#39;re doing any type of</text>
  <text start="313.13" dur="5.67">banking most of the people use a</text>
  <text start="315.56" dur="4.83">smartphone they use a computer or ready</text>
  <text start="318.8" dur="5.28">to do their banking</text>
  <text start="320.39" dur="7.86">and that&amp;#39;s all you need because once you</text>
  <text start="324.08" dur="7.38">join up to an exchange all you need to</text>
  <text start="328.25" dur="6.63">do is take your phone everywhere to pay</text>
  <text start="331.46" dur="6.12">for things even online you can pay for</text>
  <text start="334.88" dur="4.59">things using your computer or your phone</text>
  <text start="337.58" dur="4.35">and you don&amp;#39;t really need to make that</text>
  <text start="339.47" dur="5.4">many different adjustments to move to</text>
  <text start="341.93" dur="4.62">this new crypto system plus companies</text>
  <text start="344.87" dur="5.85">they really don&amp;#39;t have to spend that</text>
  <text start="346.55" dur="5.43">much money to bring on the crypto system</text>
  <text start="350.72" dur="3.84">the blockchain to join the blockchain</text>
  <text start="351.98" dur="5.1">and to accept payments it&amp;#39;s really not</text>
  <text start="354.56" dur="4.47">that difficult and the central bankers</text>
  <text start="357.08" dur="5.1">they realize this and they understand</text>
  <text start="359.03" dur="5.04">that if this takes off which it is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="362.18" dur="4.29">going to happen very very quickly</text>
  <text start="364.07" dur="6.56">remember the system is coming down</text>
  <text start="366.47" dur="8.31">remember the system right now is dead</text>
  <text start="370.63" dur="6.67">the entire system is deteriorating very</text>
  <text start="374.78" dur="4.92">very quickly and when Trump comes out</text>
  <text start="377.3" dur="4.29">and he tells you about you know the</text>
  <text start="379.7" dur="3.69">infrastructure tells you about all these</text>
  <text start="381.59" dur="4.68">different things everyone is still</text>
  <text start="383.39" dur="5.94">thinking that he&amp;#39;s doing this for the</text>
  <text start="386.27" dur="6.48">current system he is not I mean the</text>
  <text start="389.33" dur="4.8">corporate media continually is you know</text>
  <text start="392.75" dur="3.09">looking at what he&amp;#39;s doing with his tax</text>
  <text start="394.13" dur="3.63">reform and all this stuff and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="395.84" dur="3.09">comparing it and using it saying all</text>
  <text start="397.76" dur="2.16">this is not going to help the current</text>
  <text start="398.93" dur="2.4">system this is not gonna do anything</text>
  <text start="399.92" dur="3.69">with the current system this is gonna</text>
  <text start="401.33" dur="3.6">damage the current system he&amp;#39;s not doing</text>
  <text start="403.61" dur="3.63">it for the current system you need to</text>
  <text start="404.93" dur="4.61">step back a little bit and understand</text>
  <text start="407.24" dur="5.76">that he is doing this for the next</text>
  <text start="409.54" dur="5.62">system and everything that he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="413" dur="4.44">right now has nothing to do with the</text>
  <text start="415.16" dur="3.51">system that were in today I mean we can</text>
  <text start="417.44" dur="2.82">see there are so many different</text>
  <text start="418.67" dur="4.2">indicators out there right now I mean</text>
  <text start="420.26" dur="5.46">the credit markets they are flashing red</text>
  <text start="422.87" dur="4.35">right now and if people you know those</text>
  <text start="425.72" dur="5.7">who don&amp;#39;t understand what that means is</text>
  <text start="427.22" dur="7.19">bond spreads well that&amp;#39;s an economic</text>
  <text start="431.42" dur="6.12">indicator in terms of business cycles</text>
  <text start="434.41" dur="5.89">widening spreads indicate a slowing</text>
  <text start="437.54" dur="4.95">economy since companies are more likely</text>
  <text start="440.3" dur="3.96">to default in a slowing economy the</text>
  <text start="442.49" dur="3.75">credit risk related to their bond Rises</text>
  <text start="444.26" dur="4.05">for this reason investors command</text>
  <text start="446.24" dur="4.71">additional interest on corporate bonds</text>
  <text start="448.31" dur="4.83">now in the last few days we&amp;#39;ve seen an</text>
  <text start="450.95" dur="3.03">ominous reawakening in the credit</text>
  <text start="453.14" dur="2.04">markets</text>
  <text start="453.98" dur="4.65">where we&amp;#39;re starting to see these</text>
  <text start="455.18" dur="5.79">spreads start to widen and we see the</text>
  <text start="458.63" dur="6.45">European credit spreads or back to near</text>
  <text start="460.97" dur="7.08">cycle wides we also see it in the United</text>
  <text start="465.08" dur="5.16">States the same exact thing and this is</text>
  <text start="468.05" dur="6.02">another indicator to let us know</text>
  <text start="470.24" dur="6.45">something is going on Trump right now</text>
  <text start="474.07" dur="4.48">his administration is looking to clarify</text>
  <text start="476.69" dur="3.68">the rules which govern whether a person</text>
  <text start="478.55" dur="4.92">can discharge student loans in</text>
  <text start="480.37" dur="5.23">bankruptcy and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="483.47" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re looking at this and the only way</text>
  <text start="485.6" dur="5.43">to do it is if your bank rip if you show</text>
  <text start="487.67" dur="5.01">hardship right now you can readjust your</text>
  <text start="491.03" dur="4.65">student loans and what we need to</text>
  <text start="492.68" dur="4.71">understand that nearly 40% of student</text>
  <text start="495.68" dur="4.8">loan borrowers from the mid-2000s</text>
  <text start="497.39" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re gonna be defaulting by 2023 this</text>
  <text start="500.48" dur="4.56">is according to Brookings and this is a</text>
  <text start="503.18" dur="3.69">huge problem now people are saying that</text>
  <text start="505.04" dur="4.2">the job market is absolutely fine if</text>
  <text start="506.87" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s absolutely fine why are all these</text>
  <text start="509.24" dur="3.96">individuals going to default on their</text>
  <text start="511.43" dur="4.11">student loans because they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="513.2" dur="4.32">getting the high paying jobs or a lot of</text>
  <text start="515.54" dur="3.57">them can&amp;#39;t even find jobs when they come</text>
  <text start="517.52" dur="3.63">out of school now</text>
  <text start="519.11" dur="4.11">Brookings released another study</text>
  <text start="521.15" dur="3.78">revealing that most borrowers who left</text>
  <text start="523.22" dur="4.35">school owing at least fifty thousand in</text>
  <text start="524.93" dur="5.49">student loans in 2010 had failed to pay</text>
  <text start="527.57" dur="4.98">down any of their debt four years later</text>
  <text start="530.42" dur="4.74">and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="532.55" dur="4.47">those with floating rate loans the pool</text>
  <text start="535.16" dur="4.29">of those drowning in debt will only get</text>
  <text start="537.02" dur="5.88">worse as the Fed continues to hike</text>
  <text start="539.45" dur="6.45">interest rates and this is a no-win</text>
  <text start="542.9" dur="5.58">situation remember I think where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="545.9" dur="5.79">headed here and from all the actions is</text>
  <text start="548.48" dur="6.21">to write off all this debt get rid of</text>
  <text start="551.69" dur="5.58">the central bank to move us to a brand</text>
  <text start="554.69" dur="5.04">new system what is that new system well</text>
  <text start="557.27" dur="5.52">I do believe it&amp;#39;s going to involve</text>
  <text start="559.73" dur="4.94">crypto currencies I do believe that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="562.79" dur="5.1">going to be the belt and road system and</text>
  <text start="564.67" dur="4.42">I know the central bank&amp;#39;s behind the</text>
  <text start="567.89" dur="4.65">scenes which they&amp;#39;re really never</text>
  <text start="569.09" dur="5.91">mentioned they want their system they</text>
  <text start="572.54" dur="5.85">want their currency to be issued around</text>
  <text start="575" dur="5.04">the world they want a fiat currency</text>
  <text start="578.39" dur="3.24">system that they can control they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="580.04" dur="3.42">gonna make it seem fantastic in the</text>
  <text start="581.63" dur="4.56">beginning they&amp;#39;re gonna back it with</text>
  <text start="583.46" dur="4.29">gold or you know give confidence to the</text>
  <text start="586.19" dur="3.39">system with gold</text>
  <text start="587.75" dur="3.69">to say that you know we&amp;#39;re on the petrol</text>
  <text start="589.58" dur="4.71">you one or whatever they&amp;#39;re gonna do use</text>
  <text start="591.44" dur="4.95">STRs but they don&amp;#39;t want anyone using</text>
  <text start="594.29" dur="3.81">the cryptosystem because that they have</text>
  <text start="596.39" dur="4.08">no control over the only way they can</text>
  <text start="598.1" dur="5.16">have control over it is if governments</text>
  <text start="600.47" dur="4.86">passed laws and they say yes this is the</text>
  <text start="603.26" dur="4.74">currency you need to use this is the</text>
  <text start="605.33" dur="4.62">coin that you need to use and every</text>
  <text start="608" dur="4.2">person needs to use it and it will be</text>
  <text start="609.95" dur="3.84">issued by the central bank that is the</text>
  <text start="612.2" dur="4.41">only way and if they get governments to</text>
  <text start="613.79" dur="6.23">do this yes we are then screwed but we</text>
  <text start="616.61" dur="6.57">can see right now China&amp;#39;s New Silk Road</text>

  <text start="668.24" dur="5.45">they&amp;#39;re joining the belt in road and</text>
  <text start="671.3" dur="6.06">this is not only because China imports</text>
  <text start="673.69" dur="6.13">commodities such as iron ore soy corn</text>
  <text start="677.36" dur="3.63">and all that the reason they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="679.82" dur="4.019">be joining is because they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="680.99" dur="5.03">beginning investment dollars from the</text>
  <text start="683.839" dur="6.031">Asian infrastructure investment bank and</text>
  <text start="686.02" dur="6.1">the lending will increase and we can see</text>
  <text start="689.87" dur="4.35">right now that Latin American countries</text>
  <text start="692.12" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re moving away from the United</text>
  <text start="694.22" dur="8.1">States the approval of u.s. foreign</text>
  <text start="697.64" dur="8.4">policy in Latin America was around 49%</text>
  <text start="702.32" dur="6.93">it is dropped to 24% and we can see</text>
  <text start="706.04" dur="5.94">right now that the belton road this is</text>
  <text start="709.25" dur="6.12">the new trading system this is the</text>
  <text start="711.98" dur="6">future of trade and we can see already</text>
  <text start="715.37" dur="5.4">that China is putting a lot of money</text>
  <text start="717.98" dur="3.52">into this system a lot of countries are</text>
  <text start="720.77" dur="3.43">joining up</text>
  <text start="721.5" dur="6.29">and they&amp;#39;re not being forced to they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="724.2" dur="7.05">giving the proposal they&amp;#39;re gonna get</text>
  <text start="727.79" dur="6.13">money to do what they need to do to join</text>
  <text start="731.25" dur="5.82">to build the infrastructure meanwhile</text>
  <text start="733.92" dur="5.88">the united states they&amp;#39;re stuck the</text>
  <text start="737.07" dur="5.52">united states cannot offer these</text>
  <text start="739.8" dur="7.11">countries anything the only thing they</text>
  <text start="742.59" dur="6.45">had to offer was the TPP and back then</text>
  <text start="746.91" dur="3.93">the offer wasn&amp;#39;t that great that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="749.04" dur="4.41">it was shot down by so many different</text>
  <text start="750.84" dur="4.2">countries because they realized they</text>
  <text start="753.45" dur="4.17">wanted to control the countries or the</text>
  <text start="755.04" dur="4.8">court system that laid above the</text>
  <text start="757.62" dur="4.17">government&amp;#39;s so if the government you</text>
  <text start="759.84" dur="5.46">know wanted to do something that court</text>
  <text start="761.79" dur="6.27">system could reject it china and russia</text>
  <text start="765.3" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re not doing that they&amp;#39;re allowing</text>
  <text start="768.06" dur="4.44">the countries to be independent you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="769.77" dur="4.65">just joining a trade system and they</text>
  <text start="772.5" dur="3.87">want it to be a win-win type of</text>
  <text start="774.42" dur="4.62">situation I think Trump has been talking</text>
  <text start="776.37" dur="4.26">to J Jinping because what they really</text>
  <text start="779.04" dur="4.23">want to do in the background of what is</text>
  <text start="780.63" dur="4.5">all going on right now is to join this</text>
  <text start="783.27" dur="4.71">new trade system because he realizes</text>
  <text start="785.13" dur="5.28">that we need to build our infrastructure</text>
  <text start="787.98" dur="4.29">here that&amp;#39;s why he put forth the</text>
  <text start="790.41" dur="4.89">infrastructure bill it&amp;#39;s not for today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="792.27" dur="4.86">system it&amp;#39;s not because he&amp;#39;s gonna you</text>
  <text start="795.3" dur="3.81">know all of a sudden take what we have</text>
  <text start="797.13" dur="4.11">today and rebuild it and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="799.11" dur="3.93">become a manufacturing powerhouse he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="801.24" dur="3.87">rebuilding the infrastructure bringing</text>
  <text start="803.04" dur="4.65">back as much manufacturing as they</text>
  <text start="805.11" dur="5.64">possibly can to the country preparing</text>
  <text start="807.69" dur="5.34">the country for a transition into a</text>
  <text start="810.75" dur="4.08">brand-new system this is why I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="813.03" dur="3.27">think he cares about writing off the</text>
  <text start="814.83" dur="4.26">debt remember he&amp;#39;s a master of</text>
  <text start="816.3" dur="6">bankruptcy he understands when something</text>
  <text start="819.09" dur="5.91">needs to completely go away and it has</text>
  <text start="822.3" dur="6.27">to be reborn this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="825" dur="6.06">right now he realizes and he knows all</text>
  <text start="828.57" dur="6.03">the stats just like we do the country is</text>
  <text start="831.06" dur="6.09">in big big trouble now imagine if he</text>
  <text start="834.6" dur="5.85">tell the population that were bankrupt</text>
  <text start="837.15" dur="5.28">we have nothing the country we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="840.45" dur="4.05">keeping it alive by manipulating all the</text>
  <text start="842.43" dur="5.28">statistics actually the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="844.5" dur="4.83">fake the country would implode right now</text>
  <text start="847.71" dur="5.16">and he wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to do anything</text>
  <text start="849.33" dur="5.39">so what he&amp;#39;s doing right now is using</text>
  <text start="852.87" dur="5.329">their system using their</text>
  <text start="854.72" dur="6.599">techniques to build and to prepare the</text>
  <text start="858.199" dur="5.58">country for a transition into a brand</text>
  <text start="861.319" dur="4.77">new system and that&amp;#39;s why he keeps</text>
  <text start="863.779" dur="7.021">saying let&amp;#39;s make America great again</text>
  <text start="866.089" dur="8.131">and this is exactly what he is doing he</text>
  <text start="870.8" dur="5.789">is bringing us to the next level now the</text>
  <text start="874.22" dur="5.789">central bankers on the other hand they</text>
  <text start="876.589" dur="4.74">want the system to be moved to their new</text>
  <text start="880.009" dur="2.52">system and they don&amp;#39;t care what happens</text>
  <text start="881.329" dur="3.901">to the country they can care less</text>
  <text start="882.529" dur="4.62">because this is their garbage system</text>
  <text start="885.23" dur="3.719">right now they don&amp;#39;t care about it they</text>
  <text start="887.149" dur="2.851">know it&amp;#39;s dead in the water they just</text>
  <text start="888.949" dur="2.401">don&amp;#39;t want to be blamed for it because</text>
  <text start="890" dur="3.089">then they can&amp;#39;t set up shop someplace</text>
  <text start="891.35" dur="3.81">else they don&amp;#39;t care if it comes down</text>
  <text start="893.089" dur="5.701">hard they don&amp;#39;t care how many people are</text>
  <text start="895.16" dur="7.049">ruined it makes no difference to them so</text>
  <text start="898.79" dur="5.609">here we are there is a transition headed</text>
  <text start="902.209" dur="6.271">our way there&amp;#39;s a new trade system the</text>
  <text start="904.399" dur="5.61">question is when will the u.s. join when</text>
  <text start="908.48" dur="3.479">will it happen</text>
  <text start="910.009" dur="6.481">I think as we&amp;#39;re going through the</text>
  <text start="911.959" dur="7.341">transition at that time the announcement</text>
  <text start="916.49" dur="7.349">will be made that we need to join</text>
  <text start="919.3" dur="6.909">China&amp;#39;s belt and Road and everyone in</text>
  <text start="923.839" dur="3.81">Congress and everyone around they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="926.209" dur="4.38">be able to say anything because this</text>
  <text start="927.649" dur="6.93">will be the only alternative at this</text>
  <text start="930.589" dur="5.85">point and we could see that time is</text>
  <text start="934.579" dur="4.62">coming very very quickly and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="936.439" dur="4.62">have to be ready for this because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="939.199" dur="3.63">gonna go through a period of time</text>
  <text start="941.059" dur="3.921">depending on how this all plays out</text>
  <text start="942.829" dur="4.2">where we&amp;#39;re gonna be transitioning into</text>
  <text start="944.98" dur="3.49">something completely different which</text>
  <text start="947.029" dur="3.78">means the credit markets most likely</text>
  <text start="948.47" dur="5.13">going to freeze up we&amp;#39;ll probably oil</text>
  <text start="950.809" dur="4.351">shortages unless we use whatever we have</text>
  <text start="953.6" dur="4.229">here in the States and I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="955.16" dur="3.989">what they&amp;#39;ve been preparing for we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="957.829" dur="4.171">gonna see that people are going to be</text>
  <text start="959.149" dur="4.831">losing a lot of their wealth things that</text>
  <text start="962" dur="3.059">we thought that we had that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="963.98" dur="3.539">completely disappear</text>
  <text start="965.059" dur="5.4">a lot of that debt is going to disappear</text>
  <text start="967.519" dur="4.141">as we move to a brand new system so you</text>
  <text start="970.459" dur="2.82">need to be ready and prepared and you</text>
  <text start="971.66" dur="3.27">need to protect yourself how do you</text>
  <text start="973.279" dur="4.081">protect yourself well you can invest in</text>
  <text start="974.93" dur="4.11">crypto currencies you can also have gold</text>
  <text start="977.36" dur="4.26">and silver because that is going to</text>
  <text start="979.04" dur="5.669">increase in value and you&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="981.62" dur="5.13">able to use this to maybe purchase the</text>
  <text start="984.709" dur="3.931">cryptocurrency purchase the new currency</text>
  <text start="986.75" dur="4.32">you also need food</text>
  <text start="988.64" dur="3.93">supplies because as inflation hits</text>
  <text start="991.07" dur="3.66">because as we know it&amp;#39;s going to hit</text>
  <text start="992.57" dur="4.62">because the dollars going to lose value</text>
  <text start="994.73" dur="3.84">very very quickly and we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="997.19" dur="3.45">the credit markets freeze there&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="998.57" dur="4.05">be a lot less on the shelves just like</text>
  <text start="1000.64" dur="4.41">when we came off of the system the gold</text>
  <text start="1002.62" dur="4.35">system back in the 70s and we&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="1005.05" dur="4.53">on to the petro dollar system there was</text>
  <text start="1006.97" dur="5.25">a little bit of turmoil during that</text>
  <text start="1009.58" dur="5.34">period where there were gas lines jobs</text>
  <text start="1012.22" dur="4.05">nobody could find a job at that time yes</text>
  <text start="1014.92" dur="2.93">interest rates were very high because</text>
  <text start="1016.27" dur="5.07">they started to print a lot of money</text>
  <text start="1017.85" dur="5.92">currency I should say and we can see</text>
  <text start="1021.34" dur="4.38">right now that was a small hiccup this</text>
  <text start="1023.77" dur="4.71">is gonna be a little bit larger because</text>
  <text start="1025.72" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;re coming off this reserve currency</text>
  <text start="1028.48" dur="4.38">and we will no longer be the reserve</text>
  <text start="1030.61" dur="4.26">currency so things are going to change</text>
  <text start="1032.86" dur="4.32">rapidly and this is what you need to be</text>
