  <text start="43.68" dur="5.909">seeing is that all of these countries</text>
  <text start="46.559" dur="5.221">since the central bankers you know have</text>

  <text start="70.71" dur="3.99">you that we&amp;#39;re in a recovery things are</text>
  <text start="72.96" dur="3.99">getting better but if you actually look</text>
  <text start="74.7" dur="6.3">at what&amp;#39;s happening unemployment is</text>
  <text start="76.95" dur="7.61">continually going up each country needs</text>
  <text start="81" dur="6.24">more and more bailouts they they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="84.56" dur="4.75">letting go more and more people because</text>
  <text start="87.24" dur="5.04">of austerity to get the debt they have</text>
  <text start="89.31" dur="4.65">to cut costs and when they do cut costs</text>
  <text start="92.28" dur="4.799">they&amp;#39;re cutting the jobs the people that</text>
  <text start="93.96" dur="4.89">bring in the tax revenue and what</text>
  <text start="97.079" dur="3.93">happens is they don&amp;#39;t have enough</text>
  <text start="98.85" dur="3.6">revenue to pay for this debt and since</text>
  <text start="101.009" dur="2.761">they don&amp;#39;t have enough revenue what they</text>
  <text start="102.45" dur="3.36">have to do is they have to go back to</text>
  <text start="103.77" dur="4.529">the central banks and say hey we need</text>
  <text start="105.81" dur="4.349">another bailout and this is a continuous</text>
  <text start="108.299" dur="3.57">cycle which will never end of course</text>
  <text start="110.159" dur="4.5">until the current ill that country</text>
  <text start="111.869" dur="4.341">completely collapses and what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="114.659" dur="4.261">seeing since the beginning of this year</text>
  <text start="116.21" dur="5.619">right after the holiday season since the</text>
  <text start="118.92" dur="5.07">retail industry took a huge huge hit</text>
  <text start="121.829" dur="4.021">because again the people don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="123.99" dur="5.22">disposable income they can&amp;#39;t spend money</text>
  <text start="125.85" dur="5.129">on gifts so what happened sales were</text>
  <text start="129.21" dur="4.77">completely down and right after the</text>
  <text start="130.979" dur="5.01">holiday season what we saw was many many</text>
  <text start="133.98" dur="5.67">retail stores starting to close and</text>
  <text start="135.989" dur="4.621">again laying off people and now we are</text>
  <text start="139.65" dur="3.69">seeing</text>
  <text start="140.61" dur="5.94">big companies start to lay off company</text>
  <text start="143.34" dur="5.7">we see barclays dell sony laying off</text>
  <text start="146.55" dur="5.58">thousands upon thousands of people and</text>
  <text start="149.04" dur="5.16">this is starting to spread and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="152.13" dur="4.61">going to see this spread to other</text>
  <text start="154.2" dur="7.44">companies and financial institutions</text>
  <text start="156.74" dur="9.04">just like back in August all the way to</text>
  <text start="161.64" dur="5.7">October the main financial companies</text>
  <text start="165.78" dur="4.02">where they had their mortgage</text>
  <text start="167.34" dur="4.74">departments they laid off thousands upon</text>
  <text start="169.8" dur="5.19">thousands of people in the mortgage</text>
  <text start="172.08" dur="4.77">division because they understood that</text>
  <text start="174.99" dur="4.44">there would be no one coming for</text>
  <text start="176.85" dur="5.07">mortgage applications so what has</text>
  <text start="179.43" dur="4.559">happened is during that time in 2013</text>
  <text start="181.92" dur="3.69">from august to october they laid off</text>
  <text start="183.989" dur="4.681">their mortgage department and a lot of</text>
  <text start="185.61" dur="5.16">mortgage companies like 100 east coast</text>
  <text start="188.67" dur="5.58">mortgages completely closed down because</text>
  <text start="190.77" dur="7.14">they knew that the mortgage applications</text>
  <text start="194.25" dur="7.14">were plunging and they understood that</text>
  <text start="197.91" dur="5.49">the housing is in a bubble and was</text>
  <text start="201.39" dur="3.99">pumped up by the fed and they knew this</text>
  <text start="203.4" dur="3.869">beforehand even though the even though</text>
  <text start="205.38" dur="3.24">the president was out there letting</text>
  <text start="207.269" dur="3.541">everyone know in August he was in</text>
  <text start="208.62" dur="4.589">Arizona he went to that state because</text>
  <text start="210.81" dur="4.56">that was the the biggest increase in</text>
  <text start="213.209" dur="3.451">housing and he was telling everyone you</text>
  <text start="215.37" dur="3.24">know everything is in a recovery and</text>
  <text start="216.66" dur="3.12">even during the State of the Union he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="218.61" dur="3.06">letting everyone know that we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="219.78" dur="2.88">recovery which we are not and this is</text>
  <text start="221.67" dur="3">why they started laying off people</text>
  <text start="222.66" dur="3.359">because they knew that mortgage</text>
  <text start="224.67" dur="3.66">applications were going to plunge</text>
  <text start="226.019" dur="4.621">sixty-six percent and every since ever</text>
  <text start="228.33" dur="4.77">since that time in October all we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="230.64" dur="6">seen is mortgage applications decline</text>
  <text start="233.1" dur="5.37">sales decline housing prices start in a</text>
  <text start="236.64" dur="5.19">level off and starting to decline and</text>
  <text start="238.47" dur="5.22">this is all because everything is in a</text>
  <text start="241.83" dur="4.68">bubble Canada has a housing bubble the</text>
  <text start="243.69" dur="6.06">UK has a housing bubble and everything</text>
  <text start="246.51" dur="5.61">is about to pop here and we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="249.75" dur="5.16">back then now what we are seeing our</text>
  <text start="252.12" dur="5.1">banks other financial institutions</text>
  <text start="254.91" dur="4.109">saying you know what we understand the</text>
  <text start="257.22" dur="5.55">collapse is coming and what we need to</text>
  <text start="259.019" dur="5.4">do is we need to start trimming down the</text>
  <text start="262.77" dur="4.77">corporate offices and getting rid of</text>
  <text start="264.419" dur="6.091">people cutting buying back our stock and</text>
  <text start="267.54" dur="4.95">we we better do this now and we see</text>
  <text start="270.51" dur="3.93">Barclays already laying off 12,000</text>
  <text start="272.49" dur="3.27">people we&amp;#39;ve seen other</text>
  <text start="274.44" dur="3.42">but he&amp;#39;s not financial but other</text>
  <text start="275.76" dur="3.51">companies saying listen sales are just</text>
  <text start="277.86" dur="2.79">not there and they&amp;#39;re not going to get</text>
  <text start="279.27" dur="3.09">better so we need to start laying off</text>

  <text start="287.1" dur="4.56">thousands of people and what we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="289.41" dur="4.59">to see in the financial industry right</text>
  <text start="291.66" dur="5.55">now is we&amp;#39;re going to see those mass</text>
  <text start="294" dur="6.18">layoffs they are coming if you remember</text>
  <text start="297.21" dur="4.95">back in September or so Meredith Whitney</text>
  <text start="300.18" dur="6.15">said there&amp;#39;s going to be hundreds of</text>
  <text start="302.16" dur="7.5">thousands of people laid off during the</text>
  <text start="306.33" dur="6.9">fall winter of 2013 and this was at the</text>
  <text start="309.66" dur="6.84">same time she said this when the whole</text>
  <text start="313.23" dur="5.55">Syria Fiasco was going on where the</text>
  <text start="316.5" dur="4.29">government created this false flag event</text>
  <text start="318.78" dur="4.95">saying that Assad used chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="320.79" dur="4.83">in Syria and we were about to go to war</text>
  <text start="323.73" dur="3.72">and this is when they were going to do</text>
  <text start="325.62" dur="3.81">the taper and all of a sudden they</text>
  <text start="327.45" dur="5.67">called everything off and everything was</text>
  <text start="329.43" dur="6.96">pushed back but now here we are in 2014</text>
  <text start="333.12" dur="5.46">and we are seeing this all now I all</text>
  <text start="336.39" dur="3.96">completely being ramped up because they</text>
  <text start="338.58" dur="3.39">understand that we are getting very</text>
  <text start="340.35" dur="5.13">close to collapse this is why the</text>
  <text start="341.97" dur="6.63">markets continually hovering going down</text>
  <text start="345.48" dur="5.939">going up going down and we can see from</text>
  <text start="348.6" dur="5.28">the graph from 1929 compared to now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="351.419" dur="4.861">almost identical and it looks like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="353.88" dur="4.23">in a dead cat type of bounce right now</text>
  <text start="356.28" dur="5.52">and it looks like we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="358.11" dur="5.94">heading down from this point on so we</text>
  <text start="361.8" dur="4.08">can see exactly what is happening and if</text>
  <text start="364.05" dur="5.07">we look across the world right now and</text>
  <text start="365.88" dur="7.71">we go to Australia let&amp;#39;s say they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="369.12" dur="7.92">jobless rate has jumped unexpectedly to</text>
  <text start="373.59" dur="5.22">a decade high in January and they their</text>
  <text start="377.04" dur="4.41">unemployment rose to six percent in</text>
  <text start="378.81" dur="5.64">January the highest level since january</text>
  <text start="381.45" dur="6.21">of july two thousand three and of course</text>
  <text start="384.45" dur="6.69">they forecasted it at 5.8 but is now</text>
  <text start="387.66" dur="6.39">risen to 6.0 so we can see it&amp;#39;s starting</text>
  <text start="391.14" dur="5.07">to affect other places because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.05" dur="6.45">spreads it starts in a location like</text>
  <text start="396.21" dur="7.56">Europe where they are where things are</text>
  <text start="400.5" dur="5.61">horrific and then it spreads outward and</text>
  <text start="403.77" dur="3.88">what&amp;#39;s funny is we saw this happen in</text>
  <text start="406.11" dur="3.82">1929</text>
  <text start="407.65" dur="4.41">Europe was in a recession / depression</text>
  <text start="409.93" dur="4.56">of course we had Germany the whiner y</text>
  <text start="412.06" dur="6.78">Mar Republic and you know hyperinflation</text>
  <text start="414.49" dur="7.11">but here in the US we saw the wrong 20s</text>
  <text start="418.84" dur="6.389">and then all of a sudden during nineteen</text>
  <text start="421.6" dur="5.73">twenty nine to nineteen whatever when</text>
  <text start="425.229" dur="4.711">the war started it was just the Great</text>
  <text start="427.33" dur="5.25">Depression things couldn&amp;#39;t get any</text>
  <text start="429.94" dur="4.41">better they tried everything and the</text>
  <text start="432.58" dur="5.28">only thing that helped to cover the</text>
  <text start="434.35" dur="5.76">entire thing up was a war and after the</text>
  <text start="437.86" dur="5.25">war they completely reset the system</text>
  <text start="440.11" dur="5.4">with Bretton Woods so we are going to</text>
  <text start="443.11" dur="7.04">see the same thing happen now but this</text>
  <text start="445.51" dur="7.89">time it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot worse and if</text>
  <text start="450.15" dur="6.25">we look again across the world</text>
  <text start="453.4" dur="6.57">especially in the Europe area which is</text>
  <text start="456.4" dur="7.769">mimicking what happened in 1929 we are</text>
  <text start="459.97" dur="7.08">seeing unemployment reaching numbers</text>
  <text start="464.169" dur="5.731">that are so high right now that there is</text>
  <text start="467.05" dur="5.31">absolutely no real revenue coming into</text>
  <text start="469.9" dur="5.19">the government to sustain the debt of</text>
  <text start="472.36" dur="6.27">the government and this is why you see</text>
  <text start="475.09" dur="5.91">France Spain raising taxes hitting the</text>
  <text start="478.63" dur="5.069">Social Security reserves looking at</text>
  <text start="481" dur="4.979">pensions looking at ballons looking any</text>
  <text start="483.699" dur="4.771">place they can to get money and believe</text>
  <text start="485.979" dur="5.18">me the US is doing the same thing and if</text>
  <text start="488.47" dur="5.97">we look at Greece right now Greece is</text>
  <text start="491.159" dur="6.911">terrible their unemployment shot up now</text>
  <text start="494.44" dur="7.219">to twenty eight percent and the Greek</text>
  <text start="498.07" dur="6.12">youth unemployment rate is now at sixty</text>
  <text start="501.659" dur="5.44">one-point-four percent and this is</text>
  <text start="504.19" dur="7.17">supposed to be the future generation</text>
  <text start="507.099" dur="7.291">coming in and they&amp;#39;re almost all</text>
  <text start="511.36" dur="6.33">unemployed so how is this going to work</text>
  <text start="514.39" dur="6.089">it cannot and we are seeing this happen</text>
  <text start="517.69" dur="6.44">all over the place so what is Europe</text>
  <text start="520.479" dur="7.741">planning to do well we understand that</text>
  <text start="524.13" dur="6.16">they said they decided to create a balun</text>
  <text start="528.22" dur="4.17">document of course all the private</text>
  <text start="530.29" dur="4.41">western central countries have done this</text>
  <text start="532.39" dur="5.639">they copied the FDIC Bank of England</text>
  <text start="534.7" dur="6.18">document that the US and the UK created</text>
  <text start="538.029" dur="3.25">back in December of 2012 and em all the</text>
  <text start="540.88" dur="2.17">countries</text>
  <text start="541.279" dur="3.87">haven&amp;#39;t of course they created this for</text>
  <text start="543.05" dur="6.949">one reason and one reason only to take</text>
  <text start="545.149" dur="4.85">your money and right now Europe is</text>
  <text start="550.029" dur="6.22">deciding what to do and the European</text>
  <text start="553.339" dur="5.131">Union&amp;#39;s 500 million citizens could be</text>
  <text start="556.249" dur="4.471">used to fund long-term investments to</text>
  <text start="558.47" dur="4.919">boost the economy and help plug the gap</text>
  <text start="560.72" dur="6.51">left by banks since the financial crisis</text>
  <text start="563.389" dur="5.731">and this is from an EU document and what</text>
  <text start="567.23" dur="5.909">they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="569.12" dur="6.629">look inside the banks and the pension</text>
  <text start="573.139" dur="6.031">savings and they want to see if they can</text>
  <text start="575.749" dur="5.791">take that money and use it to fund the</text>
  <text start="579.17" dur="5.669">EU and this is what they are looking to</text>
  <text start="581.54" dur="5.489">do at this time and this document goes</text>
  <text start="584.839" dur="5.1">on to say that the usage will be on a</text>
  <text start="587.029" dur="5.43">purely in voluntary basis at the</text>
  <text start="589.939" dur="5.551">discretion of the Union and can thus be</text>
  <text start="592.459" dur="7.05">described as pretty much a confiscation</text>
  <text start="595.49" dur="5.61">of your money and again you know they</text>
  <text start="599.509" dur="3.75">throw a lot of different words in there</text>
  <text start="601.1" dur="5.7">and of course they&amp;#39;re out there saying</text>
  <text start="603.259" dur="6.481">that they want to mobilize more personal</text>
  <text start="606.8" dur="4.979">pension savings for long-term financing</text>
  <text start="609.74" dur="5.31">and mobilized really means confiscate</text>
  <text start="611.779" dur="5.701">and you know they use all these words</text>
  <text start="615.05" dur="5.25">that to make it sound really great but</text>
  <text start="617.48" dur="5.159">when you you cut through all the the BS</text>
  <text start="620.3" dur="4.139">and all of this what it comes down to is</text>
  <text start="622.639" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re going to take your money and</text>
  <text start="624.439" dur="4.71">this is what they have planned all along</text>
  <text start="626.059" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;re going to look at who has what</text>
  <text start="629.149" dur="3.93">and they want to take everyone&amp;#39;s money</text>
  <text start="631.399" dur="3.24">they want to look inside the bank&amp;#39;s they</text>
  <text start="633.079" dur="3.06">want to look inside your pensions they</text>
  <text start="634.639" dur="4.56">want to steal from Social Security</text>
  <text start="636.139" dur="4.591">anywhere they can they need to take the</text>
  <text start="639.199" dur="4.98">money and they are prepping and</text>
  <text start="640.73" dur="5.13">preparing to do this and eventually one</text>
  <text start="644.179" dur="4.681">day you&amp;#39;re going to wake up and guess</text>
  <text start="645.86" dur="5.49">what&amp;#39;s going to happen your bank&amp;#39;s your</text>
  <text start="648.86" dur="4.919">pension your retirement funds you&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="651.35" dur="4.799">completely locked out of them they&amp;#39;ll be</text>

  <text start="1301.539" dur="5.43">Senate and we need to pass these right</text>
  <text start="1303.759" dur="5.85">now and this is how this is going to</text>
  <text start="1306.969" dur="4.65">play out but right now in Connecticut it</text>
  <text start="1309.609" dur="4.23">looks like tens of thousands of people</text>
  <text start="1311.619" dur="4.17">in Connecticut are saying no to the gun</text>
  <text start="1313.839" dur="4.53">registration now there have been people</text>
  <text start="1315.789" dur="4.71">who went in and registered their guns</text>
  <text start="1318.369" dur="5.3">under the new laws and they said about</text>
  <text start="1320.499" dur="5.52">50,000 residents went in and actually</text>
  <text start="1323.669" dur="4.151">registered register their guns but</text>
  <text start="1326.019" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re saying about ten to 20,000</text>
  <text start="1327.82" dur="4.169">people have not and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1330.429" dur="3.57">understand why they&amp;#39;re not going to do</text>
  <text start="1331.989" dur="3.84">it and the reason is because they really</text>
  <text start="1333.999" dur="5.01">don&amp;#39;t have to because if you actually</text>
  <text start="1335.829" dur="5.19">read the Second Amendment it says the</text>
  <text start="1339.009" dur="3.211">right of the people to keep and bear</text>
  <text start="1341.019" dur="4.441">Arms shall not</text>
  <text start="1342.22" dur="6.87">fringed now if you really read this its</text>
  <text start="1345.46" dur="6.12">your right to keep and bear to carry</text>
  <text start="1349.09" dur="5.16">arms ammunition weapon military-style</text>
  <text start="1351.58" dur="5.16">weapons shall not be infringed which is</text>
  <text start="1354.25" dur="4.47">limit shall not be limited and if you</text>
  <text start="1356.74" dur="5.189">look at the court case the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="1358.72" dur="6.48">case of Marbury vs. Madison any law that</text>
  <text start="1361.929" dur="9.301">is repugnant to the Constitution is null</text>
  <text start="1365.2" dur="10.92">and void so again you can see these laws</text>
  <text start="1371.23" dur="6.96">are completely null and void according</text>
  <text start="1376.12" dur="4.32">to the Second Amendment you do not have</text>
  <text start="1378.19" dur="5.04">to they&amp;#39;re limiting your ability to have</text>
  <text start="1380.44" dur="7.44">certain weapons they&amp;#39;re limiting your</text>
  <text start="1383.23" dur="7.949">ability to have ammunition or a weapon</text>
  <text start="1387.88" dur="7.049">that has a certain number of bullets in</text>
  <text start="1391.179" dur="6.48">the magazine so again all of these laws</text>
  <text start="1394.929" dur="4.351">are completely null and void according</text>
  <text start="1397.659" dur="4.351">to the Second Amendment and these people</text>
  <text start="1399.28" dur="6">actually don&amp;#39;t have to go register their</text>
  <text start="1402.01" dur="6.27">weapons because according to the law it</text>
  <text start="1405.28" dur="7.1">says they don&amp;#39;t have to do this because</text>
  <text start="1408.28" dur="8.25">you have the right to own this weapon</text>
  <text start="1412.38" dur="8.26">okay now DHS as i reported yesterday</text>
  <text start="1416.53" dur="7.83">they&amp;#39;re purchasing about 141,000 rounds</text>
  <text start="1420.64" dur="6.39">of sniper ammo and DHS is also put in an</text>
  <text start="1424.36" dur="5.28">order for 75 point 1 million rounds of</text>
  <text start="1427.03" dur="5.91">ammunition this year now this is a this</text>
  <text start="1429.64" dur="4.44">is an addition to the billions of rounds</text>
  <text start="1432.94" dur="2.55">that they already have and of course</text>
  <text start="1434.08" dur="4.26">they say they need it for training and</text>
  <text start="1435.49" dur="6.21">and whatnot but this is a lot of</text>
  <text start="1438.34" dur="7.02">ammunition for terrorists that actually</text>
  <text start="1441.7" dur="7.109">bomb things well allegedly Blum bomb</text>
  <text start="1445.36" dur="6.66">things and you know what do they need</text>
  <text start="1448.809" dur="5.581">all this for they need sniper rounds</text>
  <text start="1452.02" dur="4.68">hundreds of thousands of sniper rounds</text>
  <text start="1454.39" dur="5.1">they need millions billions rounds of</text>
  <text start="1456.7" dur="5.43">ammunition what is this for have you</text>
  <text start="1459.49" dur="5.13">ever seen terrorists roaming around the</text>
  <text start="1462.13" dur="5.13">streets of a thousand people with</text>
  <text start="1464.62" dur="7.65">terrorist weapons and bombs I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1467.26" dur="7.77">seen it no they are doing this because</text>
  <text start="1472.27" dur="6.51">they understand when the collapse comes</text>
  <text start="1475.03" dur="7.29">they need all of this material tanks</text>
  <text start="1478.78" dur="6.51">weapons sniper rounds to control the</text>
  <text start="1482.32" dur="6.27">people of the United States and this is</text>
  <text start="1485.29" dur="6.02">why they are doing it now the DHS is</text>
  <text start="1488.59" dur="6.75">also seeking the next generation</text>
  <text start="1491.31" dur="6.1">checkpoint screening system and what</text>
  <text start="1495.34" dur="4.23">that&amp;#39;s going to be is they want to just</text>
  <text start="1497.41" dur="6.12">look through the top layer of your</text>
  <text start="1499.57" dur="6.39">clothing your shoes your socks to find</text>
  <text start="1503.53" dur="6.06">out if you have weapons or bombs and</text>
  <text start="1505.96" dur="5.67">things like that and they want to use</text>
  <text start="1509.59" dur="4.8">this and they want the checkpoint</text>
  <text start="1511.63" dur="5.34">imaging which screen more than 250</text>
  <text start="1514.39" dur="4.2">people per hour and detective you have</text>
  <text start="1516.97" dur="2.91">any type of explosive or weapons and</text>
  <text start="1518.59" dur="3.27">things like that but I find it very</text>
  <text start="1519.88" dur="4.95">interesting now that they are using the</text>
  <text start="1521.86" dur="5.01">word checkpoint and I&amp;#39;ve been saying</text>
  <text start="1524.83" dur="4.44">this for quite a while that they are</text>
  <text start="1526.87" dur="5.25">trying to get the American people used</text>
  <text start="1529.27" dur="5.13">to the word checkpoint because this is</text>
  <text start="1532.12" dur="5.73">what they&amp;#39;ve used in let&amp;#39;s say Nazi</text>
  <text start="1534.4" dur="5.4">Germany where you had to you reached a</text>
  <text start="1537.85" dur="4.47">checkpoint where they said give me your</text>
  <text start="1539.8" dur="4.65">paperwork they checked it out and they</text>
  <text start="1542.32" dur="4.05">let you pass the same thing that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1544.45" dur="3.03">to happen here in the US we understand</text>
  <text start="1546.37" dur="3.63">that they have license plate scanners</text>
  <text start="1547.48" dur="4.74">that&amp;#39;s being fed into a federal database</text>
  <text start="1550" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re taking your DNA they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="1552.22" dur="6.03">taking your fingerprint those may be</text>
  <text start="1554.02" dur="6.06">taking your iris scan they have an</text>
  <text start="1558.25" dur="7.16">agreement with most of the states right</text>
  <text start="1560.08" dur="5.33">now to have all your license information</text>
  <text start="1565.56" dur="6.37">processed up to a federal database and</text>
  <text start="1568.27" dur="5.73">your license will be a real ID and again</text>
  <text start="1571.93" dur="4.29">if you look at the United States there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1574" dur="5.16">a hundred-mile constitutional free zone</text>
  <text start="1576.22" dur="5.91">which is completely non-existent but it</text>
  <text start="1579.16" dur="5.37">is a exists in the in the eyes of the</text>
  <text start="1582.13" dur="4.86">federal government but in real life in</text>
  <text start="1584.53" dur="3.84">the way the Constitution is written</text>
  <text start="1586.99" dur="3.3">there is no such thing as a</text>
  <text start="1588.37" dur="4.5">constitutional free zone but we&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="1590.29" dur="4.5">say that they have their constitutional</text>
  <text start="1592.87" dur="4.41">free zone which is a hundred miles in</text>
  <text start="1594.79" dur="5.73">from any bordering nation or the ocean</text>
  <text start="1597.28" dur="5.19">and again they will have checkpoints in</text>
  <text start="1600.52" dur="4.13">these areas because these are the most</text>
  <text start="1602.47" dur="7.1">populated areas I mean you look</text>
  <text start="1604.65" dur="9.04">Washington New York Marilyn</text>
  <text start="1609.57" dur="9.01">Chicago LA San Francisco Texas Houston</text>
  <text start="1613.69" dur="8.869">Dallas Miami you know Atlanta you look</text>
  <text start="1618.58" dur="7.44">at all this this is a huge population</text>
  <text start="1622.559" dur="5.021">area and it covers most of the United</text>
  <text start="1626.02" dur="4.17">States and the population of the United</text>
  <text start="1627.58" dur="4.49">States and in all these areas they are</text>
  <text start="1630.19" dur="4.71">getting everyone used to the word</text>
  <text start="1632.07" dur="5.98">checkpoint because you will be checked</text>
  <text start="1634.9" dur="5.04">at every single point to make sure you</text>
  <text start="1638.05" dur="3.81">are not doing something to make sure</text>
  <text start="1639.94" dur="5.28">that you&amp;#39;re being tracked to make sure</text>
  <text start="1641.86" dur="6.24">they know where you are going every step</text>
  <text start="1645.22" dur="4.98">of the way and this is what the Nazis</text>
  <text start="1648.1" dur="4.74">used to make sure that people weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1650.2" dur="4.229">roaming free and to account for everyone</text>
  <text start="1652.84" dur="6.36">and this is why they always check your</text>
  <text start="1654.429" dur="6.781">papers ok now the Syrian opposition is</text>
  <text start="1659.2" dur="4.83">not going to meet with the government</text>

  <text start="1667.54" dur="3.3">meeting with the government delegation</text>
  <text start="1668.73" dur="4.42">the government took a very</text>
  <text start="1670.84" dur="5.61">unconstructive position and they do not</text>
  <text start="1673.15" dur="6.02">conduct negotiations well the opposition</text>
  <text start="1676.45" dur="9.359">controlled by the United States CIA</text>
  <text start="1679.17" dur="7.96">Saudi Arabia Israel wants Assad removed</text>
  <text start="1685.809" dur="3.541">and they gave them a five-page document</text>

  <text start="1689.35" dur="3.78">Assad to step down we want to put a</text>
  <text start="1691.27" dur="3.659">puppet regime in there and we like to</text>
  <text start="1693.13" dur="3.9">take over the entire country and put all</text>
  <text start="1694.929" dur="5.481">the natural resources on US dollar as a</text>
  <text start="1697.03" dur="6.6">reserve currency that was their</text>
  <text start="1700.41" dur="5.019">negotiation and of course the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1703.63" dur="4.62">government said no we&amp;#39;re not doing that</text>
  <text start="1705.429" dur="5.611">we&amp;#39;re a sovereign nation and the only</text>
  <text start="1708.25" dur="5.58">way that Assad will step down is if he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1711.04" dur="5.22">voted out of office now you have to</text>
  <text start="1713.83" dur="4.79">remember the United States has been</text>
  <text start="1716.26" dur="6.39">funding along with other countries</text>
  <text start="1718.62" dur="7.21">funding the rebels in Syria these are</text>
  <text start="1722.65" dur="5.73">the paid mercenaries that most of them</text>
  <text start="1725.83" dur="4.8">aren&amp;#39;t even syria syrian there can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1728.38" dur="5.82">they have come from all over the world</text>
  <text start="1730.63" dur="5.64">to fight for the freedom of the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1734.2" dur="3.96">people and again these are all paid</text>
  <text start="1736.27" dur="3.54">mercenaries they&amp;#39;re there because</text>
  <text start="1738.16" dur="3.85">they&amp;#39;re getting paid they&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="1739.81" dur="4.39">because they&amp;#39;ve been made they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1742.01" dur="6.33">promised certain things once they</text>
  <text start="1744.2" dur="7.59">overthrow the government and what we see</text>
  <text start="1748.34" dur="7.8">right now is that the United States is</text>
  <text start="1751.79" dur="7.5">playing up the war crime scenario that</text>
  <text start="1756.14" dur="5.46">the people in Syria need humanitarian</text>
  <text start="1759.29" dur="4.47">aid now we have to think about this for</text>
  <text start="1761.6" dur="5.1">a second the United States along with</text>
  <text start="1763.76" dur="5.76">Israel Saudi Arabia put these people</text>
  <text start="1766.7" dur="4.53">into place to fight against the</text>
  <text start="1769.52" dur="3.54">government there to pretty much we all</text>
  <text start="1771.23" dur="4.32">know what it is they want to overthrow</text>
  <text start="1773.06" dur="5.01">Assad and they want to put a puppet</text>
  <text start="1775.55" dur="4.2">regime into place to pay for all the</text>
  <text start="1778.07" dur="3.48">natural resources using the US dollar</text>
  <text start="1779.75" dur="3.42">same thing they&amp;#39;re doing in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1781.55" dur="4.01">there&amp;#39;s no difference they did it all in</text>
  <text start="1783.17" dur="5.7">the other countries Libya Lebanon Yemen</text>
  <text start="1785.56" dur="6.07">Iraq all those countries the same thing</text>
  <text start="1788.87" dur="4.59">happened now the United States with</text>
  <text start="1791.63" dur="5.04">other nations have created this problem</text>
  <text start="1793.46" dur="5.61">and again these rebels are not Syrian</text>
  <text start="1796.67" dur="4.53">most of them are not and they have</text>
  <text start="1799.07" dur="4.53">committed horrific crimes we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="1801.2" dur="5.91">them on videos ripping people&amp;#39;s hearts</text>
  <text start="1803.6" dur="9.03">out decapitating people and they were</text>
  <text start="1807.11" dur="8.22">actually the ones who did the attack of</text>
  <text start="1812.63" dur="5.49">the chemical weapons in August that that</text>
  <text start="1815.33" dur="4.92">pretty much hurt all those people and we</text>
  <text start="1818.12" dur="9.45">have to use common sense here why would</text>
  <text start="1820.25" dur="12.18">the Syrian president okay use weapons on</text>
  <text start="1827.57" dur="8.04">his own people it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="1832.43" dur="4.65">whatsoever his people support him why</text>
  <text start="1835.61" dur="5.04">would he actually use the weapons</text>
  <text start="1837.08" dur="8.03">against his own people it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="1840.65" dur="7.41">especially when he invited with Russia</text>
  <text start="1845.11" dur="7.51">invited the UN Security Council in in</text>
  <text start="1848.06" dur="6.24">August to inspect the country for</text>
  <text start="1852.62" dur="4.56">chemical weapons for a different</text>
  <text start="1854.3" dur="5.04">chemical attack at the same time that</text>
  <text start="1857.18" dur="4.53">happened all of a sudden there was a</text>
  <text start="1859.34" dur="4.89">chemical weapon attack which crossed a</text>
  <text start="1861.71" dur="6.51">red line of President Obama it makes</text>
  <text start="1864.23" dur="7.44">absolutely no sense that he would do</text>
  <text start="1868.22" dur="7.02">anything like that a sane person who</text>
  <text start="1871.67" dur="4.2">runs the country wouldn&amp;#39;t invite the UN</text>
  <text start="1875.24" dur="2.43">Council</text>
  <text start="1875.87" dur="3.9">in there and then say you know what</text>
  <text start="1877.67" dur="5.67">let&amp;#39;s fire some chemical weapons off it</text>
  <text start="1879.77" dur="6.9">makes no sense whatsoever and we can see</text>
  <text start="1883.34" dur="6.42">what is happening here so what happened</text>
  <text start="1886.67" dur="6.33">now is the u.s. is going out to the UN</text>
  <text start="1889.76" dur="6.66">saying listen we need humanitarian aid</text>
  <text start="1893" dur="6.51">and here is a draft for the UN Security</text>
  <text start="1896.42" dur="6.24">Council on how we&amp;#39;re going to handle the</text>
  <text start="1899.51" dur="5.25">humanitarian aid access to Syria and</text>
  <text start="1902.66" dur="4.59">this is what it looks like and this is</text>
  <text start="1904.76" dur="4.74">what it says and Russia said absolutely</text>
  <text start="1907.25" dur="4.28">not we&amp;#39;re going to veto this because</text>
  <text start="1909.5" dur="5.34">basically what it says in this</text>
  <text start="1911.53" dur="5.95">humanitarian UN resolution that Assad</text>
  <text start="1914.84" dur="6.589">has committed war crimes and we need to</text>
  <text start="1917.48" dur="3.949">go the UN needs to go in there and</text>
  <text start="1921.76" dur="5.56">supply humanitarian aid access to the</text>
  <text start="1925.19" dur="4.95">people and Russia said we&amp;#39;ll wait a</text>
  <text start="1927.32" dur="4.98">minute you&amp;#39;re accusing and if we all</text>
  <text start="1930.14" dur="4.59">sign off on this it says that he is</text>
  <text start="1932.3" dur="6.24">committed war crimes and now you can go</text>
  <text start="1934.73" dur="6.72">in there and this looks like you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1938.54" dur="6.15">setting up a way to get in and remove</text>
  <text start="1941.45" dur="5.729">Assad know this we are not going to sign</text>
  <text start="1944.69" dur="4.83">this we are going to veto this and we</text>
  <text start="1947.179" dur="4.051">will not allow this to happen and this</text>
  <text start="1949.52" dur="4.44">is what is happening right now because</text>
  <text start="1951.23" dur="5.67">they the US government the central</text>
  <text start="1953.96" dur="5.64">bankers are going to try every single</text>
  <text start="1956.9" dur="6.24">trick in the book to try to get Assad</text>
  <text start="1959.6" dur="6.24">removed until they go ahead with their</text>
  <text start="1963.14" dur="5.34">false flag event and will see this ramp</text>

  <text start="1995.66" dur="5.64">more tax in Iran here and again we know</text>
  <text start="1998.9" dur="7.08">that Stuxnet was committed by the US</text>

  <text start="2075.28" dur="4.59">against the growing threat of cyber</text>
  <text start="2077.32" dur="4.29">attacks and cyber threats posed one of</text>
  <text start="2079.87" dur="4.11">the greatest national security dangers</text>
  <text start="2081.61" dur="4.26">of the United States faces and this is</text>
  <text start="2083.98" dur="5.7">what President President Barack Obama</text>
  <text start="2085.87" dur="5.82">said a report report called framework</text>
  <text start="2089.68" dur="4.41">for improving critical infrastructure of</text>
  <text start="2091.69" dur="3.78">cyber security is the latest step in the</text>
  <text start="2094.09" dur="3.18">federal government efforts to better</text>
  <text start="2095.47" dur="3.99">coordinate and share information on</text>
  <text start="2097.27" dur="4.38">cyber threats right now it&amp;#39;s voluntary</text>
  <text start="2099.46" dur="5.73">they want all the companies to give them</text>
  <text start="2101.65" dur="5.16">their information and they want this</text>
  <text start="2105.19" dur="3.66">information passed to the government</text>
  <text start="2106.81" dur="4.11">this is actually what Cisco says but</text>
  <text start="2108.85" dur="4.53">right now it&amp;#39;s voluntary because what</text>
  <text start="2110.92" dur="4.5">have we seen in the past well we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="2113.38" dur="4.41">cyber attacks on target Neiman Marcus</text>
  <text start="2115.42" dur="5.13">and other retail stores we&amp;#39;ve seen cyber</text>
  <text start="2117.79" dur="5.34">attacks on news agencies like CNN we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2120.55" dur="5.37">seen cyber attacks on paypal and ebay</text>
  <text start="2123.13" dur="4.02">and now they&amp;#39;re coming out of course</text>
  <text start="2125.92" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re using all these cyber attack</text>
  <text start="2127.15" dur="3.72">saying hey all you companies you need to</text>
  <text start="2129.25" dur="3.78">start sharing information with us so we</text>
  <text start="2130.87" dur="4.44">can protect you and eventually we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2133.03" dur="3.96">going to see more cyber attacks and this</text>
  <text start="2135.31" dur="4.2">is when we&amp;#39;re going to see sis by being</text>
  <text start="2136.99" dur="5.01">brought up and it will no longer be</text>
  <text start="2139.51" dur="3.63">voluntary to share the information every</text>
  <text start="2142" dur="3.059">company will have to</text>
  <text start="2143.14" dur="3.84">share their information all to the</text>
  <text start="2145.059" dur="4.591">federal government and they will</text>
  <text start="2146.98" dur="6.299">completely take control of the internet</text>
  <text start="2149.65" dur="5.639">at this point now there is an energy</text>
  <text start="2153.279" dur="4.861">expert out there and we understand the</text>
  <text start="2155.289" dur="5.101">power grid did get hit and it was a</text>
  <text start="2158.14" dur="5.28">physical attack by professionals and</text>
  <text start="2160.39" dur="5.25">right now the energy expert welling off</text>
  <text start="2163.42" dur="3.599">is saying that the United States remains</text>
  <text start="2165.64" dur="3.689">vulnerable to a terrorist attack that</text>
  <text start="2167.019" dur="4.32">could cripple its power grid and throw</text>
  <text start="2169.329" dur="3.69">the nation into chaos and we understand</text>
  <text start="2171.339" dur="3.561">they&amp;#39;ve been planning this they know</text>
  <text start="2173.019" dur="5.191">it&amp;#39;s going to happen Janet Napolitano</text>
  <text start="2174.9" dur="4.84">said not if but when and many other</text>
  <text start="2178.21" dur="3.899">people have come out over the year</text>
  <text start="2179.74" dur="5.19">saying that the power grid is very</text>
  <text start="2182.109" dur="5.01">vulnerable and this goes on to say that</text>
  <text start="2184.93" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s been demonstrated to us now that</text>
  <text start="2187.119" dur="5.4">there are people who have been training</text>
  <text start="2189.46" dur="5.399">for this type of attack they have the</text>
  <text start="2192.519" dur="6.111">ability to perpetrate this type of</text>
  <text start="2194.859" dur="7.26">attack and execute it with precision and</text>
  <text start="2198.63" dur="5.02">this goes on to say even more than what</text>
  <text start="2202.119" dur="4.021">I know this is well enough saying this</text>
  <text start="2203.65" dur="5.159">way I know is what was an attack that</text>
  <text start="2206.14" dur="5.79">was purposeful done with intention to</text>
  <text start="2208.809" dur="4.29">destroy a very high value very important</text>
  <text start="2211.93" dur="3.45">part of our electric grid and</text>
  <text start="2213.099" dur="4.621">infrastructure which were high voltage</text>
  <text start="2215.38" dur="4.86">substations that attack was extremely</text>
  <text start="2217.72" dur="5.039">well-planned and was then very very well</text>
  <text start="2220.24" dur="4.319">executed in a professional manner by</text>
  <text start="2222.759" dur="5.28">people who have a high degree of</text>
  <text start="2224.559" dur="5.641">training so that&amp;#39;s what I know now of</text>
  <text start="2228.039" dur="5.161">course jeh Johnson the head of Homeland</text>
  <text start="2230.2" dur="5.52">Security had to step in and what he was</text>
  <text start="2233.2" dur="4.5">saying is that the attackers of April 16</text>
  <text start="2235.72" dur="4.22">substation North Carolina we&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="2237.7" dur="4.26">to describe power to Silicon Valley</text>
  <text start="2239.94" dur="4.3">Johnson said the public needs to</text>
  <text start="2241.96" dur="5.549">understand that such events could be</text>
  <text start="2244.24" dur="5.43">carried out by a cyber attack a cyber</text>
  <text start="2247.509" dur="4.711">attack could cause similar and in some</text>
  <text start="2249.67" dur="4.02">cases far greater damage by taking</text>
  <text start="2252.22" dur="3.66">several facilities offline</text>
  <text start="2253.69" dur="5.639">simultaneously and potentially leaving</text>
  <text start="2255.88" dur="6.06">millions of Americans in the dark and we</text>
  <text start="2259.329" dur="5.28">are being hit by cyber attacks every day</text>
  <text start="2261.94" dur="6.359">to these power grid infrastructure</text>
  <text start="2264.609" dur="6.541">systems and the risk is very high and</text>
  <text start="2268.299" dur="4.831">also went on to say our critical</text>
  <text start="2271.15" dur="4.98">infrastructure continues to be at risk</text>
  <text start="2273.13" dur="6.3">from threats in cyberspace and our</text>
  <text start="2276.13" dur="5.76">economy might be harmed from them now</text>
  <text start="2279.43" dur="4.89">this is the second time I heard</text>
  <text start="2281.89" dur="5.37">something about the economy being harmed</text>
  <text start="2284.32" dur="5.27">the first one was yesterday when I said</text>
  <text start="2287.26" dur="6.21">that the target and the Neiman Marcus</text>
  <text start="2289.59" dur="7.99">were not directed toward harming the</text>
  <text start="2293.47" dur="8.94">economy now Homeland Security jeh</text>
  <text start="2297.58" dur="8.46">Johnson say says that these threats and</text>
  <text start="2302.41" dur="6.81">cyber seis cyberspace could harm the</text>
  <text start="2306.04" dur="6.06">economy so this is the second time I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2309.22" dur="4.71">been hearing this and now I can see what</text>

  <text start="2313.93" dur="6.27">bringing in and now letting the people</text>
  <text start="2316.09" dur="7.68">know that cyber attacks could hurt the</text>
  <text start="2320.2" dur="6.48">economy they are building the propaganda</text>
  <text start="2323.77" dur="4.89">for the next cyber attack we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2326.68" dur="4.59">coming we understand they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
