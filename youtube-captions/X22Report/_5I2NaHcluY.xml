  <text start="78.97" dur="5.429">sides to the economy one which are these</text>
  <text start="82.57" dur="3.329">statistical numbers which give us this</text>
  <text start="84.399" dur="4.11">great illusion that the economy is doing</text>

  <text start="101.59" dur="4.68">maybe not working and they are realizing</text>
  <text start="105.009" dur="3.631">and they are understanding what is going</text>
  <text start="106.27" dur="5.279">on here and we&amp;#39;ve been talking about the</text>
  <text start="108.64" dur="4.92">housing market middle class the housing</text>
  <text start="111.549" dur="4.5">market is very important to the middle</text>
  <text start="113.56" dur="5.069">class because this is really their store</text>
  <text start="116.049" dur="4.08">of wealth and when house prices go up</text>
  <text start="118.629" dur="3.66">they feel very comfortable when house</text>
  <text start="120.129" dur="4.981">prices come down they feel like things</text>
  <text start="122.289" dur="5.161">are not going their way and a lot of</text>
  <text start="125.11" dur="4.709">individuals take home equity line of</text>

  <text start="129.819" dur="5.191">purchase or send their children to</text>
  <text start="132.099" dur="5.131">college or do other things and if your</text>
  <text start="135.01" dur="3.66">house is not appreciating you just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="137.23" dur="3.06">do these things and you might even have</text>
  <text start="138.67" dur="2.34">to do it to repair a roof or something</text>
  <text start="140.29" dur="3.839">like that</text>
  <text start="141.01" dur="5.49">we are starting to see now that the</text>
  <text start="144.129" dur="8.461">housing market the prices are coming</text>
  <text start="146.5" dur="8.64">down and the sales of pending existing</text>
  <text start="152.59" dur="4.71">and new home sales they are declining</text>
  <text start="155.14" dur="5.34">now yesterday we talked about existing</text>
  <text start="157.3" dur="5.46">home sales they&amp;#39;ve declined and the</text>
  <text start="160.48" dur="4.89">outlook does not look good this is the</text>
  <text start="162.76" dur="4.559">very very popular time of the year where</text>
  <text start="165.37" dur="4.53">people like to sell their homes make</text>
  <text start="167.319" dur="4.291">sure their kids get in the home before</text>

  <text start="171.61" dur="3.989">so they can register their children so</text>
  <text start="173.62" dur="3.66">they can go to school it&amp;#39;s warm weather</text>
  <text start="175.599" dur="3.961">people like to move in at this time if</text>
  <text start="177.28" dur="6.84">flowers are blooming it feels great but</text>
  <text start="179.56" dur="5.91">we are not seeing the housing market do</text>
  <text start="184.12" dur="2.97">what it&amp;#39;s supposed to do during the</text>
  <text start="185.47" dur="3.54">summer months and we saw this</text>
  <text start="187.09" dur="4.5">during last summer and the summer before</text>
  <text start="189.01" dur="5.46">this and when we look at it it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="191.59" dur="4.77">worse and worse as time goes on now new</text>
  <text start="194.47" dur="4.62">home sales that were expected to rebound</text>
  <text start="196.36" dur="6.78">by 2.2 percent month on month after</text>
  <text start="199.09" dur="6.69">crashing over five percent in June but</text>
  <text start="203.14" dur="5.03">guess what it didn&amp;#39;t happen the sales</text>
  <text start="205.78" dur="6">tumbled to 1.7 percent month on month</text>
  <text start="208.17" dur="7.03">after an upward revision so it&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="211.78" dur="6.75">worse than we even think it is so June&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="215.2" dur="6.24">5.3 percent drop was revised up to 2.4</text>
  <text start="218.53" dur="6.66">percent drop which impacted the miss in</text>
  <text start="221.44" dur="6.99">July and we could see that this whole</text>
  <text start="225.19" dur="8.189">entire situation with the housing market</text>
  <text start="228.43" dur="7.08">it&amp;#39;s not going to turn out well if we</text>
  <text start="233.379" dur="4.771">look at the humic home buying condition</text>
  <text start="235.51" dur="5.19">we see that people are looking at this</text>
  <text start="238.15" dur="4.74">and saying listen it&amp;#39;s not a good time</text>
  <text start="240.7" dur="5.19">to purchase a house interest rates are</text>
  <text start="242.89" dur="4.47">moving up a lot of the houses aren&amp;#39;t for</text>
  <text start="245.89" dur="3.51">sale anymore people are taking them off</text>
  <text start="247.36" dur="5.49">the market prices on homes are coming</text>
  <text start="249.4" dur="6.57">down and it just doesn&amp;#39;t look good we</text>
  <text start="252.85" dur="5.52">see that the PMI is there signaling that</text>
  <text start="255.97" dur="5.75">the US economy has cooled second quarter</text>
  <text start="258.37" dur="5.7">manufacturing has led to a slowdown and</text>
  <text start="261.72" dur="4.81">when we start to look at this we can see</text>
  <text start="264.07" dur="4.8">that US manufacturing and services PMI</text>
  <text start="266.53" dur="5.009">they miss their expectations and drop</text>
  <text start="268.87" dur="6.12">for the third month in a row and it</text>
  <text start="271.539" dur="6.271">looks like manufacturing is slowing</text>
  <text start="274.99" dur="5.19">right now I know the plan is to bring</text>
  <text start="277.81" dur="4.35">manufacturing back to the United States</text>
  <text start="280.18" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s a great plan but you need to</text>
  <text start="282.16" dur="4.08">remember that the central banker is the</text>
  <text start="284.41" dur="4.86">deep state they&amp;#39;ve had many many many</text>
  <text start="286.24" dur="6.149">many years I mean everything since 1913</text>
  <text start="289.27" dur="7.68">to move everything out of this country</text>
  <text start="292.389" dur="6.811">and once 1970 came they had the ability</text>
  <text start="296.95" dur="3.089">to push their agenda to the extreme</text>
  <text start="299.2" dur="3.149">where they were able to move</text>
  <text start="300.039" dur="4.711">manufacturing corporations and many</text>
  <text start="302.349" dur="4.32">other things out of this country so they</text>
  <text start="304.75" dur="4.11">had many years to do this and to bring</text>
  <text start="306.669" dur="3.991">it all back within a year two years</text>
  <text start="308.86" dur="2.88">three years is completely impossible</text>
  <text start="310.66" dur="2.819">first of all we don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="311.74" dur="4.25">infrastructure second of all we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="313.479" dur="6.391">have the manufacturing plans ready to go</text>
  <text start="315.99" dur="4.69">also we don&amp;#39;t have the individuals to</text>
  <text start="319.87" dur="2.91">work</text>
  <text start="320.68" dur="3.75">in these areas because most of the</text>
  <text start="322.78" dur="3.24">people that have been laid off they have</text>
  <text start="324.43" dur="3.57">been working in manufacturing for quite</text>
  <text start="326.02" dur="5.119">a while remember we lost about 2.3</text>
  <text start="328" dur="6.21">million jobs or so in manufacturing so</text>
  <text start="331.139" dur="5.59">to bring it all back in a year or two is</text>
  <text start="334.21" dur="5.19">quite impossible but I understand the</text>
  <text start="336.729" dur="5.071">long term plan where we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="339.4" dur="5.639">bring back manufacturing for the future</text>
  <text start="341.8" dur="4.05">yes that does make sense how do we get</text>
  <text start="345.039" dur="2.731">to the future</text>
  <text start="345.85" dur="4.289">well you need to bring the current</text>
  <text start="347.77" dur="5.04">system down and restart the entire thing</text>
  <text start="350.139" dur="6">and all these signs that we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="352.81" dur="5.37">at home sales new home sales retail and</text>
  <text start="356.139" dur="3.96">things like that these are all</text>
  <text start="358.18" dur="4.109">indicators which is the you know</text>
  <text start="360.099" dur="3.63">everyday person on the street where</text>
  <text start="362.289" dur="2.791">they&amp;#39;re realizing that listen I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="363.729" dur="4.321">have enough money to go out and purchase</text>
  <text start="365.08" dur="5.64">in retail online or brick-and-mortar I</text>
  <text start="368.05" dur="4.77">don&amp;#39;t have enough saved up I don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="370.72" dur="3.81">a good enough job to purchase a house</text>
  <text start="372.82" dur="4.23">especially if interest rates move up</text>
  <text start="374.53" dur="6.02">remember they created this housing boom</text>
  <text start="377.05" dur="7.589">with very very low interest rates and</text>
  <text start="380.55" dur="6.19">they started the you know 0% down 3%</text>
  <text start="384.639" dur="4.111">down just to try to get people in same</text>
  <text start="386.74" dur="4.799">thing with the automobiles they went all</text>
  <text start="388.75" dur="4.44">the way down past subprime to anyone</text>
  <text start="391.539" dur="4.35">with a heartbeat just to bring people in</text>
  <text start="393.19" dur="5.36">to sell the automobiles that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="395.889" dur="4.861">coming to an end running out of people</text>
  <text start="398.55" dur="4.39">hmm maybe that&amp;#39;s why they wanted to</text>
  <text start="400.75" dur="4.62">bring all these illegals into the</text>
  <text start="402.94" dur="6.3">country because you have fresh new</text>
  <text start="405.37" dur="5.82">people to take out loans and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="409.24" dur="4.41">the central bank likes that&amp;#39;s part of</text>
  <text start="411.19" dur="7.08">their agenda we see right now that loan</text>
  <text start="413.65" dur="6.15">demand has suddenly tumbled and what is</text>
  <text start="418.27" dur="4.53">happening here is as interest rates move</text>
  <text start="419.8" dur="6.78">up companies it looks like they are</text>
  <text start="422.8" dur="7.89">reaching a point where they can&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="426.58" dur="6.24">out any more money now what is causing</text>
  <text start="430.69" dur="3.06">the unexpected slump well according to</text>
  <text start="432.82" dur="3.36">Bank of America</text>
  <text start="433.75" dur="4.71">it appears that despite such favorable</text>
  <text start="436.18" dur="4.32">survey results commercial banks are</text>
  <text start="438.46" dur="5.37">having an unusually slow summer in terms</text>
  <text start="440.5" dur="4.979">of lending activity to companies this is</text>
  <text start="443.83" dur="3.63">troubling and probably indicates that</text>
  <text start="445.479" dur="3.93">companies this year are finally</text>
  <text start="447.46" dur="4.92">responding to the increase in the</text>
  <text start="449.409" dur="5.051">relative cost of debt by using less of</text>
  <text start="452.38" dur="4.66">it and if rates continue to</text>
  <text start="454.46" dur="4.8">as they most likely will absent in</text>
  <text start="457.04" dur="4.41">unexpected dovish turned by the Fed in</text>
  <text start="459.26" dur="4.14">the coming months it would indicate that</text>
  <text start="461.45" dur="5.07">for the majority of the US corporations</text>
  <text start="463.4" dur="5.76">the clearing level of rates has finally</text>
  <text start="466.52" dur="5.22">been hit and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="469.16" dur="4.67">loan domain expectations well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="471.74" dur="4.92">going to accelerate to the downside</text>
  <text start="473.83" dur="4.84">hitting not only bank interest income</text>
  <text start="476.66" dur="4.41">but also the broader economy as the</text>
  <text start="478.67" dur="6.71">average US company hits a growth plateau</text>
  <text start="481.07" dur="6.84">and this is going to have an effect on</text>
  <text start="485.38" dur="5.11">corporate earnings growth the broader</text>
  <text start="487.91" dur="4.14">economy and everything else now one</text>
  <text start="490.49" dur="2.7">thing we need to understand everything</text>
  <text start="492.05" dur="3.39">that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at these are</text>
  <text start="493.19" dur="3.96">just all different indicators and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="495.44" dur="4.71">been looking at all these indicators for</text>
  <text start="497.15" dur="5.61">a very long time and we&amp;#39;ve been showing</text>
  <text start="500.15" dur="5.01">that the economy was built up on an</text>
  <text start="502.76" dur="4.61">illusion the numbers were manipulated</text>
  <text start="505.16" dur="4.8">the economy has been slowly</text>
  <text start="507.37" dur="5.8">deteriorating they continually try to</text>
  <text start="509.96" dur="5.19">pump it up but the people&amp;#39;s economy is</text>
  <text start="513.17" dur="3.54">deteriorating very very quickly and you</text>
  <text start="515.15" dur="4.56">can see it in many different areas</text>
  <text start="516.71" dur="6.15">especially in retail now in real estate</text>
  <text start="519.71" dur="6.06">in manufacturing and many other areas</text>
  <text start="522.86" dur="5.37">that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at and the</text>
  <text start="525.77" dur="5.55">reason is that this economy was never</text>
  <text start="528.23" dur="6.8">meant to go this far the central banking</text>
  <text start="531.32" dur="5.79">system was not designed to go this far</text>
  <text start="535.03" dur="4.15">because they know there&amp;#39;s a certain</text>
  <text start="537.11" dur="4.44">point in time where there&amp;#39;s just way too</text>
  <text start="539.18" dur="4.5">much debt they can&amp;#39;t do anything with it</text>
  <text start="541.55" dur="3.81">and they have to restart it one way or</text>
  <text start="543.68" dur="4.02">another and this is why we see this</text>
  <text start="545.36" dur="5.79">battle between the Patriots and the</text>
  <text start="547.7" dur="6.15">central bank we need to keep one thing</text>
  <text start="551.15" dur="5.46">in mind people are looking at what is</text>
  <text start="553.85" dur="5.58">going on with Trump looking at cue</text>
  <text start="556.61" dur="6">looking at exposing everything and</text>
  <text start="559.43" dur="7.98">that&amp;#39;s coming up very very soon and once</text>
  <text start="562.61" dur="6.81">this does happen the economy is going to</text>
  <text start="567.41" dur="5.07">hit I see today Trump is out there and</text>
  <text start="569.42" dur="5.49">he&amp;#39;s saying listen if I&amp;#39;m impeached the</text>
  <text start="572.48" dur="5.31">stock market&amp;#39;s going to come down let me</text>
  <text start="574.91" dur="5.1">ask you this if all this information</text>
  <text start="577.79" dur="6.24">comes out that the mainstream media has</text>
  <text start="580.01" dur="7.34">been lying that Clinton Comey and the</text>
  <text start="584.03" dur="5.45">rest they are treasonous</text>
  <text start="587.35" dur="3.72">and we have documentation to back all</text>
  <text start="589.48" dur="5.19">this up and then declassify the IG</text>
  <text start="591.07" dur="4.86">report we know from Q that people are</text>
  <text start="594.67" dur="3.66">going to reject this people gonna be</text>
  <text start="595.93" dur="5.31">very angry what do you think is going to</text>
  <text start="598.33" dur="5.94">happen to the economy what do you think</text>
  <text start="601.24" dur="5.91">is going to happen to this country it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="604.27" dur="5.61">all going to fall apart and it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="607.15" dur="4.65">come down pretty down rapidly because</text>
  <text start="609.88" dur="5.04">people are going to be angry pissed off</text>
  <text start="611.8" dur="4.83">and once this information comes out</text>
  <text start="614.92" dur="3.39">people are going to look into other</text>
  <text start="616.63" dur="4.26">information like maybe the central bank</text>
  <text start="618.31" dur="5.61">the Fed what are they up to what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="620.89" dur="4.86">on with all of this and this is going to</text>
  <text start="623.92" dur="5.73">be this is going to bring down the</text>
  <text start="625.75" dur="6.18">entire system this is not just oh let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="629.65" dur="3.63">just you know take these people send</text>
  <text start="631.93" dur="2.52">them to jail and the rest of the country</text>
  <text start="633.28" dur="3.87">is going to be fine because remember</text>
  <text start="634.45" dur="4.38">most of the country they&amp;#39;re sleeping</text>
  <text start="637.15" dur="3.66">right now they don&amp;#39;t know that this</text>
  <text start="638.83" dur="4.41">economy is a gigantic illusion they</text>
  <text start="640.81" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t know that these individuals have</text>
  <text start="643.24" dur="3.69">been running this economy for their</text>
  <text start="644.95" dur="5.25">benefit not for the people&amp;#39;s benefit and</text>
  <text start="646.93" dur="7.58">when all this information comes out the</text>
  <text start="650.2" dur="7.77">whole house of cards comes down and that</text>
  <text start="654.51" dur="8.23">includes the economy that includes</text>
  <text start="657.97" dur="7.11">everything and this will be the</text>
  <text start="662.74" dur="6">transition this will be the transition</text>

  <text start="723.029" dur="5.261">businesses are saying that they have to</text>
  <text start="725.019" dur="6.451">layoff and all of a sudden we start to</text>
  <text start="728.29" dur="5.789">get the real information about what the</text>
  <text start="731.47" dur="4.619">economy is really doing and a lot more</text>
  <text start="734.079" dur="4.291">stores closed a lot more businesses</text>

  <text start="752.829" dur="5.43">you won&amp;#39;t be able to get so if you</text>
  <text start="755.889" dur="5.82">haven&amp;#39;t started to prepare now I would</text>
  <text start="758.259" dur="5.791">start you can go to any of the warehouse</text>
  <text start="761.709" dur="4.711">type stores like Costco BJ&amp;#39;s or whatever</text>
  <text start="764.05" dur="4.95">you want to do and you can stock up on</text>
  <text start="766.42" dur="5.609">supplies you can keep gold and silver</text>
  <text start="769" dur="4.92">you know in your home someplace say if</text>
  <text start="772.029" dur="3.961">you can keep cash someplace in your home</text>
  <text start="773.92" dur="7.169">safe this is my opinion this is what I</text>
  <text start="775.99" dur="8.579">do and you can keep certain materials</text>
  <text start="781.089" dur="6.151">within your possession to make sure that</text>
  <text start="784.569" dur="5.341">you have everything that you need water</text>
  <text start="787.24" dur="4.829">medical medication things like that</text>
  <text start="789.91" dur="4.35">because once everything starts to fall</text>
  <text start="792.069" dur="3.63">apart and yes they&amp;#39;re gonna try to bring</text>
  <text start="794.26" dur="3.75">it up as quickly as possible</text>
  <text start="795.699" dur="3.601">will that be easy when I say quickly as</text>
  <text start="798.01" dur="3.18">possible I don&amp;#39;t mean like the next day</text>
  <text start="799.3" dur="4.05">I mean it might take three four or five</text>
  <text start="801.19" dur="3.69">months I mean think about it go back to</text>
  <text start="803.35" dur="2.82">the 70s when we were the reserve</text>
  <text start="804.88" dur="3.12">currency and we came off the gold</text>
  <text start="806.17" dur="3.21">standard and you&amp;#39;re moving us on onto</text>
  <text start="808" dur="3.329">the petro dollar system for those people</text>
  <text start="809.38" dur="3.63">that remember I mean how long did you</text>
  <text start="811.329" dur="4.2">have to go to the gas station and wait</text>
  <text start="813.01" dur="5.129">for fuel on those odd/even days or the</text>
  <text start="815.529" dur="4.261">green flag red flag for those people</text>
  <text start="818.139" dur="3.44">that were trying to get a job in the 70s</text>
  <text start="819.79" dur="3.75">how long did it take you to get a job I</text>
  <text start="821.579" dur="3.671">mean these are the things that you have</text>
  <text start="823.54" dur="3.57">to think of yes in the later 70s move</text>
  <text start="825.25" dur="4.139">into the 80s when things started to even</text>
  <text start="827.11" dur="3.839">out and interest rate started to come</text>
  <text start="829.389" dur="4.111">down again and things like that and</text>
  <text start="830.949" dur="5.541">credit opened up it was a whole new</text>
  <text start="833.5" dur="4.949">world but that transition period of time</text>
  <text start="836.49" dur="5.62">remember back and if he can&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="838.449" dur="7.111">back to that time because you&amp;#39;re not old</text>
  <text start="842.11" dur="5.479">enough asks someone ask them what</text>
  <text start="845.56" dur="5.759">happened during that period of time and</text>
  <text start="847.589" dur="5.74">they will tell you and that was a time</text>
  <text start="851.319" dur="3.631">when we were the reserve currency and</text>
  <text start="853.329" dur="3.181">were coming off the gold soon and we had</text>
  <text start="854.95" dur="5.04">a little bit of that and we&amp;#39;re moving on</text>
  <text start="856.51" dur="6.06">to a new system now we&amp;#39;re at the end</text>
  <text start="859.99" dur="4.35">cycle of a central banking system we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="862.57" dur="4.08">not coming off the gold standard we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="871.54" dur="7.53">gigantic illusionary statistical number</text>
  <text start="875.11" dur="6.27">nightmare and once all this falls apart</text>
