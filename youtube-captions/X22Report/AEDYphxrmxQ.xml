  <text start="35.87" dur="6.41">episode 1029 be and today&amp;#39;s date is july</text>
  <text start="38.899" dur="5.971">22nd 2016 and thought of the episode is</text>
  <text start="42.28" dur="5.14">DHS is enforcing the 100-mile</text>
  <text start="44.87" dur="5.149">constitutional free zone which is a</text>
  <text start="47.42" dur="5.58">complete violation of the Constitution</text>
  <text start="50.019" dur="6.31">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="53" dur="6.449">political and geopolitical news now we</text>
  <text start="56.329" dur="5.73">understand that the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="59.449" dur="5.941">believe they&amp;#39;re above the law actually</text>
  <text start="62.059" dur="6.301">christine lagarde as the chief of IMF</text>
  <text start="65.39" dur="6.03">she doesn&amp;#39;t even pay taxes but we can</text>
  <text start="68.36" dur="6.75">see in france it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="71.42" dur="5.94">gonna put her on trial for a four</text>
  <text start="75.11" dur="6.3">hundred million dollar euro payout case</text>
  <text start="77.36" dur="5.549">and we can see this was back in 2008</text>
  <text start="81.41" dur="4.379">she&amp;#39;s accused of negligence which</text>
  <text start="82.909" dur="7.081">resulted in a misuse of public funds by</text>
  <text start="85.789" dur="6.061">a third party so it looks like she&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="89.99" dur="4.26">standing trial we&amp;#39;ll have to see how</text>
  <text start="91.85" dur="4.26">this goes but at this point with all the</text>
  <text start="94.25" dur="4.35">central bankers they should all be</text>
  <text start="96.11" dur="6.78">arrested like Iceland did throw them</text>
  <text start="98.6" dur="6.54">into jail and continue on with this</text>
  <text start="102.89" dur="4.89">country without the central banking</text>
  <text start="105.14" dur="3.99">system and those people who are in</text>
  <text start="107.78" dur="3.6">government who are in line with the</text>
  <text start="109.13" dur="5.879">central bank those people should also</text>
  <text start="111.38" dur="6.059">leave office and we the people should</text>
  <text start="115.009" dur="5.07">take control of our country once again</text>
  <text start="117.439" dur="5.1">that is the endgame here for we the</text>
  <text start="120.079" dur="5.851">people actually the founding fathers has</text>
  <text start="122.539" dur="7.321">done this before Thomas Jefferson was</text>
  <text start="125.93" dur="5.339">out there telling us that once again we</text>
  <text start="129.86" dur="3.27">will have to do this they have given us</text>
  <text start="131.269" dur="3.571">freedom I think you said for about a</text>
  <text start="133.13" dur="3.54">hundred years actually it lasted a</text>
  <text start="134.84" dur="4.95">little bit longer than that and he said</text>
  <text start="136.67" dur="5.97">once again you will have to fight to be</text>
  <text start="139.79" dur="5.58">free and it looks like we&amp;#39;re reaching</text>
  <text start="142.64" dur="4.439">that point once again and we can see</text>
  <text start="145.37" dur="3.989">that the government is continually</text>
  <text start="147.079" dur="4.5">taking away as many rights as they</text>
  <text start="149.359" dur="5.041">possibly can even though it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="151.579" dur="4.711">violation of the Constitution now very</text>
  <text start="154.4" dur="5.01">interestingly a Wall Street Journal</text>
  <text start="156.29" dur="6.27">reporter who covers the Middle East had</text>
  <text start="159.41" dur="4.5">a bit of a trouble when coming back into</text>
  <text start="162.56" dur="5.04">the United States Murray</text>
  <text start="163.91" dur="5.94">yeah Abby Habib well she was detained by</text>
  <text start="167.6" dur="5.97">federal agents at Los Angeles</text>
  <text start="169.85" dur="5.88">International Airport they demanded they</text>
  <text start="173.57" dur="5.34">demanded her to hand over her cell</text>
  <text start="175.73" dur="5.82">phones and she was shocked to learn that</text>
  <text start="178.91" dur="6.33">border agents have the authority to do</text>
  <text start="181.55" dur="6.27">that the reporter has both us and</text>
  <text start="185.24" dur="4.98">Lebanese citizenship and was traveling</text>
  <text start="187.82" dur="5.67">on American passport she was flying to</text>
  <text start="190.22" dur="5.07">Los Angeles from Beirut and she was</text>
  <text start="193.49" dur="5.07">taken out of the line and immigration</text>
  <text start="195.29" dur="5.52">the agents asked her for her cell phone</text>
  <text start="198.56" dur="5.13">cell phones in order to collect some</text>
  <text start="200.81" dur="5.4">information and she said you know</text>
  <text start="203.69" dur="5.46">something no you cannot have my cell</text>
  <text start="206.21" dur="4.77">phones she said she had the First</text>
  <text start="209.15" dur="5.31">Amendment right behind her as a</text>
  <text start="210.98" dur="8.07">journalist and she was protected under</text>
  <text start="214.46" dur="6.9">this now the agents presented a DHS</text>
  <text start="219.05" dur="3.45">document which explained the government</text>
  <text start="221.36" dur="6.03">had the right to confiscate phones</text>
  <text start="222.5" dur="10.74">within that 100-mile constitutional free</text>
  <text start="227.39" dur="12.93">zone around the country and we can see</text>
  <text start="233.24" dur="9.57">right now this law is null and void it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="240.32" dur="4.71">in violation of the Constitution there</text>
  <text start="242.81" dur="8.91">is no such thing as a constitutional</text>
  <text start="245.03" dur="9.09">free zone they made this up now she went</text>
  <text start="251.72" dur="4.2">on and said listen you cannot have these</text>
  <text start="254.12" dur="5.48">phones the property of the Wall Street</text>
  <text start="255.92" dur="6.15">Journal I would have to call my boss and</text>
  <text start="259.6" dur="7.12">they will have to get their lawyers down</text>
  <text start="262.07" dur="7.95">here to discuss with you why you need</text>
  <text start="266.72" dur="5.22">these two cell phones now of course DHS</text>
  <text start="270.02" dur="4.17">one off they talk to their management</text>
  <text start="271.94" dur="3.9">and they said okay you can go then now</text>
  <text start="274.19" dur="5.46">everyone doesn&amp;#39;t have this ability I</text>
  <text start="275.84" dur="6">know this but we all need to fight back</text>
  <text start="279.65" dur="4.23">and say no under the Constitution which</text>
  <text start="281.84" dur="5.31">is the law land there&amp;#39;s no law above</text>
  <text start="283.88" dur="7.2">this you do not have the right to go</text>
  <text start="287.15" dur="6.329">ahead and take my personal belongings</text>
  <text start="291.08" dur="6.3">you don&amp;#39;t have the right to search me if</text>
  <text start="293.479" dur="5.551">you are a citizen of the United States</text>
  <text start="297.38" dur="5.55">you are protected this is why the</text>
  <text start="299.03" dur="7.35">founding fathers did this so we wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="302.93" dur="4.53">have things like this but we can see</text>
  <text start="306.38" dur="5.61">what the government is doing at this</text>
  <text start="307.46" dur="8.34">point again slowly but surely they want</text>
  <text start="311.99" dur="5.79">everyone to understand and believe that</text>
  <text start="315.8" dur="5.13">there are constitutional reasons this is</text>
  <text start="317.78" dur="5.61">why they started in colleges oh you can</text>
  <text start="320.93" dur="4.62">go over here and talk about anything you</text>
  <text start="323.39" dur="4.35">want this is the free speech zone when</text>
  <text start="325.55" dur="5.49">people want a protest this is a free</text>
  <text start="327.74" dur="6.21">speech zone what we as a people have to</text>
  <text start="331.04" dur="5.04">do is say absolutely not we will not go</text>
  <text start="333.95" dur="5.85">into those areas because the entire</text>
  <text start="336.08" dur="6.77">country is protected under the</text>
  <text start="339.8" dur="10.29">Constitution and it is free speech</text>
  <text start="342.85" dur="11.14">everywhere now Obama has come out and he</text>
  <text start="350.09" dur="7.26">has said that because of these shootings</text>
  <text start="353.99" dur="5.46">with police they&amp;#39;re going to authorize</text>
  <text start="357.35" dur="4.98">the police agencies once again to</text>
  <text start="359.45" dur="5.16">acquire military equipment as we can see</text>
  <text start="362.33" dur="8.04">this was part of the agenda because as</text>
  <text start="364.61" dur="11.22">we know out in the open they put this</text>
  <text start="370.37" dur="9.36">ban on police not to purchase military</text>
  <text start="375.83" dur="6.87">equipment but covertly they were still</text>
  <text start="379.73" dur="5.96">being given to the police now Obama</text>
  <text start="382.7" dur="6.33">wants to accelerate this process and</text>
  <text start="385.69" dur="5.02">they&amp;#39;re getting riot gear armored</text>
  <text start="389.03" dur="4.76">vehicles once again military grade</text>
  <text start="390.71" dur="6.72">equipment and the question once again</text>
  <text start="393.79" dur="6.28">why do the police need this type of</text>
  <text start="397.43" dur="4.59">equipment what are they expecting to</text>
  <text start="400.07" dur="5.7">happen here in the United States why is</text>
  <text start="402.02" dur="7.1">this happening in Europe because they</text>
  <text start="405.77" dur="7.5">understand they realize what is coming</text>
  <text start="409.12" dur="8.17">when this system starts to deteriorate</text>
  <text start="413.27" dur="6.18">very very quickly people are going to be</text>
  <text start="417.29" dur="4.38">shocked people are not going to</text>
  <text start="419.45" dur="5.34">understand what&amp;#39;s going on people are</text>
  <text start="421.67" dur="6.32">going to riot so what they need to do is</text>
  <text start="424.79" dur="6.59">they need to maintain control and order</text>
  <text start="427.99" dur="6.67">now can they do this everywhere now</text>
  <text start="431.38" dur="7.69">can it be used to protect certain</text>
  <text start="434.66" dur="6.42">government offices yes and we can see</text>
  <text start="439.07" dur="4.2">what they&amp;#39;re most likely going to do and</text>
  <text start="441.08" dur="5.07">this is why there&amp;#39;s FEMA camps they will</text>
  <text start="443.27" dur="4.62">round people up and bring them to these</text>
  <text start="446.15" dur="5.97">camp telling you that it&amp;#39;s a good place</text>
  <text start="447.89" dur="8.69">for you to go and we can see as things</text>
  <text start="452.12" dur="8.73">start to fall apart this is the agenda</text>
  <text start="456.58" dur="6.22">that they have planned for and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="460.85" dur="3.6">just the United States many countries</text>
  <text start="462.8" dur="5.4">are doing this this is why we see so</text>
  <text start="464.45" dur="5.13">many of these draconian laws this is why</text>
  <text start="468.2" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re enacted this is why we see state</text>
  <text start="469.58" dur="6.75">of emergencies in France in Turkey now</text>
  <text start="473.42" dur="5.54">this is why we see false flag events</text>
  <text start="476.33" dur="5.72">like this newest one in Munich Germany</text>
  <text start="478.96" dur="5.89">what do you think is going to happen</text>
  <text start="482.05" dur="6.04">well most likely they&amp;#39;ll blame this on a</text>
  <text start="484.85" dur="6.51">terrace they&amp;#39;ll say they need new laws</text>
  <text start="488.09" dur="4.83">they need new troops on the ground they</text>
  <text start="491.36" dur="4.56">need to control the people to keep them</text>
  <text start="492.92" dur="4.68">safe this is what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="495.92" dur="3.39">and this is going to spread we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="497.6" dur="3.06">saying this for quite a while that this</text>
  <text start="499.31" dur="6.8">is going to accelerate we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="500.66" dur="8.82">see more of this because this is what</text>
  <text start="506.11" dur="4.75">they&amp;#39;re going to use to convince the</text>
  <text start="509.48" dur="4.62">people that the government needs to</text>
  <text start="510.86" dur="7.05">protect them and we know this doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="514.1" dur="9.51">work because most of this is fake phony</text>
  <text start="517.91" dur="8.4">or false it was planned and even if it</text>
  <text start="523.61" dur="6.78">wasn&amp;#39;t planned and there is some type of</text>
  <text start="526.31" dur="7.59">an event they&amp;#39;ll spin the story to make</text>
  <text start="530.39" dur="7.05">you believe that it was terrorism so</text>
  <text start="533.9" dur="5.61">they can push their agenda now out in</text>
  <text start="537.44" dur="4.53">Japan we understand that there&amp;#39;s been a</text>
  <text start="539.51" dur="4.65">huge amount of protest where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="541.97" dur="4.32">protesting against the military bases in</text>
  <text start="544.16" dur="4.2">Okinawa but it looks like the</text>
  <text start="546.29" dur="5.28">construction of the helipad for the US</text>
  <text start="548.36" dur="5.07">military forces it has resumed and it</text>
  <text start="551.57" dur="3.75">looks like they&amp;#39;re continuing on with</text>
  <text start="553.43" dur="4.35">this base which wait we kind of knew</text>
  <text start="555.32" dur="4.89">this was going to happen because the</text>
  <text start="557.78" dur="5.1">encirclement of China is taking place</text>
  <text start="560.21" dur="4.8">right now and they need things built and</text>
  <text start="562.88" dur="2.55">ready for what is coming because as we</text>
  <text start="565.01" dur="3.69">know</text>
  <text start="565.43" dur="5.7">the naval encirclement of China well</text>
  <text start="568.7" dur="7.62">it&amp;#39;s been underway for over a decade now</text>
  <text start="571.13" dur="8.72">and the United States has been pushing</text>
  <text start="576.32" dur="5.91">this for quite a while and we can see</text>
  <text start="579.85" dur="5.32">just the last couple of years it is</text>
  <text start="582.23" dur="5.88">accelerated in this area because we have</text>
  <text start="585.17" dur="6.84">Australia South Korea we have the</text>
  <text start="588.11" dur="9.69">Philippines we have Vietnam we have</text>
  <text start="592.01" dur="8.18">Japan encircling China Russia and North</text>
  <text start="597.8" dur="4.67">Korea and we understand that they</text>
  <text start="600.19" dur="5.44">created this missile shield they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="602.47" dur="7.21">placing the fad missile system in South</text>
  <text start="605.63" dur="7.14">Korea and there are many systems in many</text>
  <text start="609.68" dur="4.89">of the islands around China and we can</text>
  <text start="612.77" dur="5.31">see right now that the United States</text>
  <text start="614.57" dur="5.82">used the Philippines to push a lawsuit</text>
  <text start="618.08" dur="5.49">in The Hague allowing the United States</text>
  <text start="620.39" dur="6.27">to sail ships around the islands even</text>
  <text start="623.57" dur="7.05">though the United States didn&amp;#39;t sign the</text>
  <text start="626.66" dur="5.04">freedom of navigation but we can see</text>
  <text start="630.62" dur="4.25">right now they&amp;#39;re getting other</text>
  <text start="631.7" dur="5.88">countries into this we see the French</text>
  <text start="634.87" dur="5.409">they will be bringing ships into the</text>
  <text start="637.58" dur="6.18">area and like I said what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="640.279" dur="4.711">is they&amp;#39;re provoking China and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="643.76" dur="2.94">going to continually do this and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="644.99" dur="4.23">going to see accelerate and we are</text>
  <text start="646.7" dur="6.81">seeing this right now we think we see</text>
  <text start="649.22" dur="8.76">things building up in Ukraine it is</text>
  <text start="653.51" dur="7.29">heating up dramatically right now the</text>
  <text start="657.98" dur="6.18">southeastern people have left the osc</text>
  <text start="660.8" dur="7.74">the OSCE come in take a look at the</text>
  <text start="664.16" dur="6.24">borders they can visit the borders that</text>
  <text start="668.54" dur="3.57">are not controlled by Kiev but they</text>
  <text start="670.4" dur="4.32">can&amp;#39;t stay there so they went they took</text>
  <text start="672.11" dur="5.3">a look and we don&amp;#39;t know what they</text>
  <text start="674.72" dur="7.91">reported we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see</text>
  <text start="677.41" dur="9.7">Russia has put out a warning Churkin has</text>
  <text start="682.63" dur="6.93">written a letter to the UN SC explaining</text>
  <text start="687.11" dur="6.99">the latest developments in Don bass</text>
  <text start="689.56" dur="6.76">about the increased shelling about what</text>
  <text start="694.1" dur="4.26">is happening with Kiev that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="696.32" dur="3">making concrete steps aimed at</text>
  <text start="698.36" dur="4.68">de-escalating</text>
  <text start="699.32" dur="6.9">tensions and they&amp;#39;re showing clear</text>
  <text start="703.04" dur="6.17">evidence that the Ukrainian military is</text>
  <text start="706.22" dur="4.98">preparing a military operation there and</text>
  <text start="709.21" dur="6.88">Russia is calling on the international</text>
  <text start="711.2" dur="8.13">partners to convince Kiev to prevent and</text>
  <text start="716.09" dur="6.63">stop this offensive that&amp;#39;s about to</text>
  <text start="719.33" dur="5.82">happen and we can see that Russia is at</text>
  <text start="722.72" dur="4.8">the UN saying listen we see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="725.15" dur="8.37">happening here and it&amp;#39;s going to go</text>
  <text start="727.52" dur="7.92">fully live any day at this point and we</text>
  <text start="733.52" dur="5.01">know we knew that this was going to</text>
  <text start="735.44" dur="5.91">happen so we see the acceleration in the</text>
  <text start="738.53" dur="5.07">South China Sea we see the acceleration</text>
  <text start="741.35" dur="6.71">in Ukraine where everything is starting</text>
  <text start="743.6" dur="9.33">to heat up and we see that there is a</text>
  <text start="748.06" dur="7.24">naval exercise in the Black Sea the USS</text>
  <text start="752.93" dur="4.71">Ross an Aegis carrying guided missile</text>

  <text start="757.64" dur="5.78">is taken part of the sea breeze 2016</text>
  <text start="760.46" dur="5.73">exercise and this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="763.42" dur="5.68">combined force of the US and Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="766.19" dur="5.43">Navy&amp;#39;s the same time they&amp;#39;re preparing</text>
  <text start="769.1" dur="4.05">for a major offensive and it seems like</text>
  <text start="771.62" dur="4.29">they always have these type of drills</text>
  <text start="773.15" dur="5.31">during the same period so we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="775.91" dur="5.22">have to watch the situation in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="778.46" dur="4.53">very very carefully because we can see</text>
  <text start="781.13" dur="5.1">things are going to get out of control</text>
  <text start="782.99" dur="5.97">there we see France is going to supply</text>
  <text start="786.23" dur="4.29">weapons to Iraq they will be there next</text>
  <text start="788.96" dur="3.9">month and we know they charles de gaulle</text>
  <text start="790.52" dur="4.77">the aircraft carrier right now it looks</text>
  <text start="792.86" dur="6.99">like it will actually get into the</text>
  <text start="795.29" dur="9.3">Mediterranean by September now Turkey</text>
  <text start="799.85" dur="7.56">has said to Russia listen flights can</text>
  <text start="804.59" dur="5.36">continue on into Russia it&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="807.41" dur="5.43">completely safe don&amp;#39;t worry about it</text>
  <text start="809.95" dur="5.74">Electric has been supplied and restored</text>
  <text start="812.84" dur="5.34">to the Incirlik base and they are off</text>
  <text start="815.69" dur="3.96">the generators right now so things look</text>
  <text start="818.18" dur="6.36">like they&amp;#39;re turning back to normal at</text>
  <text start="819.65" dur="9.15">that base and we see that early one he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="824.54" dur="7.71">using the coup as we know to purge a lot</text>
  <text start="828.8" dur="6.27">of the military judges academia</text>
  <text start="832.25" dur="4.62">teachers you name it this is what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="835.07" dur="5.61">doing but what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="836.87" dur="10.47">all this is that this is a very big list</text>
  <text start="840.68" dur="10.83">and for someone just to all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="847.34" dur="8.69">come out from a coup and have the list</text>
  <text start="851.51" dur="8.88">of people ready and standing by to purge</text>
  <text start="856.03" dur="10.42">this many people the lists must have</text>
  <text start="860.39" dur="8.78">been pre-planned because as we know even</text>
  <text start="866.45" dur="5.91">from the United States when 911 happened</text>
  <text start="869.17" dur="5.44">they already had the Patriot Act written</text>
  <text start="872.36" dur="5.78">ready to go because they already knew</text>
  <text start="874.61" dur="7.35">that this was a planned event this in</text>
  <text start="878.14" dur="6.43">Turkey was completely planned and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="881.96" dur="4.35">still waiting for indicators now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="884.57" dur="3.57">a lot of people out there saying that</text>
  <text start="886.31" dur="6.5">turkey now is siding with Russia and</text>
  <text start="888.14" dur="9">that might be Putin as we know needs to</text>
  <text start="892.81" dur="7.33">strategically get turkey on his side we</text>
  <text start="897.14" dur="5.4">know the United States and NATO want</text>
  <text start="900.14" dur="5.79">Turkey to do something they want full</text>
  <text start="902.54" dur="6.21">power in Turkey so they can push their</text>
  <text start="905.93" dur="5.28">agenda in Syria now we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="908.75" dur="4.29">indicators on both sides them and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="911.21" dur="6.42">going to have to wait to see how this</text>
  <text start="913.04" dur="7.62">turns out and I know many people have</text>
  <text start="917.63" dur="5.64">different theories I have my theories</text>
  <text start="920.66" dur="6.41">where I still believe that this is being</text>
  <text start="923.27" dur="5.85">used for a major operation in Syria</text>
  <text start="927.07" dur="4.59">because the United States government</text>
  <text start="929.12" dur="5.4">central bankers are stuck now Putin</text>
  <text start="931.66" dur="6.49">might be pushing the agenda to bring</text>
  <text start="934.52" dur="6.63">turkey over to his side because we saw</text>
  <text start="938.15" dur="7.29">earlier one call Putin we saw earlier</text>
  <text start="941.15" dur="8.58">one make a move to apologize for the</text>
  <text start="945.44" dur="7.05">down jet but other than that we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="949.73" dur="4.64">seen other actions from ered one and</text>
  <text start="952.49" dur="5.49">this is something that we&amp;#39;re waiting for</text>
  <text start="954.37" dur="6.31">now IRDA one has said there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="957.98" dur="5.58">obstacle to extending turkeys state of</text>
  <text start="960.68" dur="5.08">emergency that they can extend it at any</text>
  <text start="963.56" dur="4.75">time</text>
  <text start="965.76" dur="4.62">and this should be a very big concern</text>
  <text start="968.31" dur="3.99">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="970.38" dur="5.16">that he has full control of the country</text>
  <text start="972.3" dur="5.22">he has full power of the country just</text>
  <text start="975.54" dur="5.07">like France where they&amp;#39;re under state of</text>
  <text start="977.52" dur="5.34">emergency and if you notice most likely</text>
  <text start="980.61" dur="4.89">Germany will go under state of emergency</text>
  <text start="982.86" dur="4.38">i think munich has declared a state of</text>
  <text start="985.5" dur="3.99">emergency and i&amp;#39;ll probably expanded to</text>
  <text start="987.24" dur="4.59">germany because if you notice each one</text>
  <text start="989.49" dur="5.31">of these countries are declaring state</text>
  <text start="991.83" dur="5.88">of emergency and it looks like this is</text>
  <text start="994.8" dur="5.58">spreading for something much larger to</text>
  <text start="997.71" dur="7.35">control the population to give the</text>
  <text start="1000.38" dur="7.26">leaders more power now when we look at</text>
  <text start="1005.06" dur="4.38">what the united states has done they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1007.64" dur="7.74">been bombing the islamic state for two</text>
  <text start="1009.44" dur="9">years and they have spent 11.5 million</text>
  <text start="1015.38" dur="6.63">dollars a day for the past five hundred</text>
  <text start="1018.44" dur="7.68">and forty-two days they&amp;#39;ve dropped fifty</text>
  <text start="1022.01" dur="6.78">thousand bombs and the islamic state</text>
  <text start="1026.12" dur="6.15">during this period expanded their</text>
  <text start="1028.79" dur="5.4">territory to give a comparison the</text>
  <text start="1032.27" dur="6.36">us-led forces in Afghanistan they only</text>
  <text start="1034.19" dur="8.759">drop 16,000 bombs so we can see right</text>
  <text start="1038.63" dur="5.73">now that the United States uses the</text>
  <text start="1042.949" dur="3.901">Islamic state like we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="1044.36" dur="5.76">about for a very long time and in</text>
  <text start="1046.85" dur="5.61">October of 2015 the US military claimed</text>
  <text start="1050.12" dur="6.03">it had killed 20,000 Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1052.46" dur="6.57">fighters in that year but somehow the</text>
  <text start="1056.15" dur="6.75">Islamic state force was the same size</text>
  <text start="1059.03" dur="7.37">and growing which again makes no sense</text>
  <text start="1062.9" dur="6.12">it was only until Russia came in and</text>
  <text start="1066.4" dur="5.17">actually started bombing the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1069.02" dur="6.54">state where they had the problem now</text>
  <text start="1071.57" dur="6.66">Lavrov is saying that turkey the Russian</text>
  <text start="1075.56" dur="6.63">turkey relations will depend on the</text>
  <text start="1078.23" dur="8.39">cooperation on Syria now this is the</text>
  <text start="1082.19" dur="8.15">part where we have to watch if turkey</text>
  <text start="1086.62" dur="7.42">turns towards Russia they will no longer</text>
  <text start="1090.34" dur="5.79">have the goal of removing Assad from</text>
  <text start="1094.04" dur="2.09">power</text>
  <text start="1096.29" dur="5.25">this is what we need to watch we need to</text>
  <text start="1098.42" dur="5.13">watch the actions because Lavrov has</text>
  <text start="1101.54" dur="4.26">said we have presented a lot of evidence</text>
  <text start="1103.55" dur="4.71">that indicates that turkeys territory is</text>
  <text start="1105.8" dur="5.46">widely used to finance terrorists and</text>
  <text start="1108.26" dur="5.1">redeploy gunmen to Syria now that we</text>
  <text start="1111.26" dur="3.6">have resumed our relations it will be</text>
  <text start="1113.36" dur="3.84">difficult to ignore the fact that our</text>
  <text start="1114.86" dur="4.74">Turkish partners will have no will have</text>
  <text start="1117.2" dur="5.88">to answer these questions now and not</text>
  <text start="1119.6" dur="6.23">only answer but also take steps as they</text>
  <text start="1123.08" dur="6.47">use their territory to support this war</text>
  <text start="1125.83" dur="6.46">let&amp;#39;s see what turkey does at this point</text>
  <text start="1129.55" dur="5.83">are they still under the power of the</text>
  <text start="1132.29" dur="6.06">West or now are they under the power of</text>
  <text start="1135.38" dur="5.37">Russia and if they are under the power</text>
  <text start="1138.35" dur="6.38">of Russia the United States just lost</text>
  <text start="1140.75" dur="7.47">the strategic location which is turkey</text>
  <text start="1144.73" dur="7.24">now Kerry is continually talking to</text>
  <text start="1148.22" dur="7.53">Russia Lavrov trying to put together the</text>
  <text start="1151.97" dur="6.63">ceasefire deal and every time during the</text>
  <text start="1155.75" dur="8.22">discussion Kerry continually raises the</text>
  <text start="1158.6" dur="8.64">issue of assads fate and Russia</text>
  <text start="1163.97" dur="6.36">continually tells Kerry it&amp;#39;s not up to</text>
  <text start="1167.24" dur="8.64">us it&amp;#39;s up to the people of Syria and</text>
  <text start="1170.33" dur="7.23">this has always been the problem because</text>
  <text start="1175.88" dur="6.51">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="1177.56" dur="7.32">bankers their goal is always the same to</text>
  <text start="1182.39" dur="3.93">remove Assad their tactics might change</text>
  <text start="1184.88" dur="3.03">and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="1186.32" dur="5.7">the only reason they&amp;#39;re changing is</text>
  <text start="1187.91" dur="5.97">because Russia got involved now the US</text>
  <text start="1192.02" dur="4.68">and I see it all over the corporate</text>
  <text start="1193.88" dur="5.7">media is using the story that Russian</text>
  <text start="1196.7" dur="5.1">planes bombed a secret military base in</text>
  <text start="1199.58" dur="4.62">Syria used by elite american and british</text>
  <text start="1201.8" dur="4.98">forces last month now Russia&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="1204.2" dur="5.04">well we&amp;#39;re completely unaware of this</text>
  <text start="1206.78" dur="5.7">secret base in Syria and we have no</text>
  <text start="1209.24" dur="5.61">knowledge of the incident now this is</text>
  <text start="1212.48" dur="4.98">very interesting it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1214.85" dur="5.4">trying to make a move to blame Russia on</text>
  <text start="1217.46" dur="5.55">hitting a secret base in Syria but the</text>
  <text start="1220.25" dur="6.48">question is why is there a secret base</text>
  <text start="1223.01" dur="6.65">in Syria who gave the United States the</text>
  <text start="1226.73" dur="8.06">UK permission to have a secret base</text>
  <text start="1229.66" dur="8.69">in Syria the US the UK the coalition</text>
  <text start="1234.79" dur="7.65">forces have invaded a sovereign country</text>
  <text start="1238.35" dur="6.85">they built a base they built airfields</text>
  <text start="1242.44" dur="5.82">and now they&amp;#39;re trying to use it to</text>
  <text start="1245.2" dur="5.69">blame Russia we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="1248.26" dur="6.59">watch that situation very very carefully</text>
  <text start="1250.89" dur="7.96">now we&amp;#39;ve seen another false flag in</text>
  <text start="1254.85" dur="6.01">Germany and it looks like the reporting</text>
  <text start="1258.85" dur="5.85">that six people have died one of the</text>
  <text start="1260.86" dur="5.28">shooters has committed suicide a state</text>
  <text start="1264.7" dur="4.74">of emergency as the book has been</text>
  <text start="1266.14" dur="7.95">declared in Munich and we can see right</text>
  <text start="1269.44" dur="6.63">now most likely they will expand the</text>
  <text start="1274.09" dur="4.29">state of emergency they&amp;#39;ll create new</text>
  <text start="1276.07" dur="4.8">laws they&amp;#39;ll say they need new troops on</text>
  <text start="1278.38" dur="4.77">the ground to protect the people we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1280.87" dur="4.56">been seeing this in Belgium we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="1283.15" dur="5.91">it in France we&amp;#39;re going to see it in</text>
  <text start="1285.43" dur="6.84">Germany and this is all part of the</text>
  <text start="1289.06" dur="6.54">system completely falling apart because</text>
  <text start="1292.27" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re going to continually do this to</text>
  <text start="1295.6" dur="4.62">take away more and more rights of the</text>
  <text start="1297.37" dur="4.92">people to maintain control and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1300.22" dur="4.83">going to see this pop up in many other</text>
  <text start="1302.29" dur="5.37">countries as we move towards the endgame</text>
  <text start="1305.05" dur="5.76">we&amp;#39;re going to see more of these false</text>
  <text start="1307.66" dur="4.77">flag types now most likely they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1310.81" dur="3.45">to blame this on the Islamic state I</text>
  <text start="1312.43" dur="3.9">think the Islamic state is already taken</text>
  <text start="1314.26" dur="4.14">credit for it and we know most of the</text>
  <text start="1316.33" dur="6.86">time this is completely fake phony and</text>
  <text start="1318.4" dur="7.89">false the US is warning its citizens in</text>
  <text start="1323.19" dur="8.17">Saudi Arabia about an imminent threat</text>
  <text start="1326.29" dur="8.22">and they&amp;#39;re warning people not to go out</text>
  <text start="1331.36" dur="4.77">in certain areas and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="1334.51" dur="5.36">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="1336.13" dur="7.32">are ready to create chaos in the entire</text>
  <text start="1339.87" dur="6.31">region and eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1343.45" dur="5.76">happen is they will create chaos here in</text>
  <text start="1346.18" dur="6.63">the United States in the way of physical</text>
  <text start="1349.21" dur="6.44">attacks cyber attacks it will blame the</text>
  <text start="1352.81" dur="5.43">entire thing either on the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1355.65" dur="6.34">they&amp;#39;ll blame the cyber attacks maybe</text>
  <text start="1358.24" dur="5.02">North Korea China Russia to all the same</text>
  <text start="1361.99" dur="4.72">players</text>
  <text start="1363.26" dur="6.57">and this is how they will try to get us</text>
  <text start="1366.71" dur="7.28">into a major war this is how they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1369.83" dur="9.18">explain away the financial system</text>
