  <text start="484.81" dur="3.6">take a rocket scientist to figure out</text>
  <text start="486.61" dur="6.81">that this economy is going absolutely</text>
  <text start="488.41" dur="8.58">nowhere now the oil prices are</text>
  <text start="493.42" dur="5.46">continually being suppressed down we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="496.99" dur="5.31">seeing that oil has dropped below thirty</text>
  <text start="498.88" dur="5.58">dollars per barrel and the last time we</text>
  <text start="502.3" dur="5.61">had a crisis back in two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="504.46" dur="6.45">it was the subprime mortgages but this</text>
  <text start="507.91" dur="4.71">time it is oil that is playing a</text>
  <text start="510.91" dur="7.53">starring role in the global financial</text>
  <text start="512.62" dur="8.52">crisis since the start of 2015 42 North</text>

  <text start="529.41" dur="5.65">fifty percent of all energy junk bonds</text>
  <text start="532.51" dur="6.24">are distressed and this is coming from</text>
  <text start="535.06" dur="8.01">Standard and Poor&amp;#39;s but this oil crash</text>
  <text start="538.75" dur="8.57">is nothing to cheer about as far as the</text>
  <text start="543.07" dur="7.47">big banks are concerned and these banks</text>
  <text start="547.32" dur="8.41">gave out billions upon billions of</text>
  <text start="550.54" dur="8.76">dollars in loans to fund expensive</text>
  <text start="555.73" dur="6.66">drilling projects all over the world now</text>
  <text start="559.3" dur="5.85">those firms are dropping like flies and</text>
  <text start="562.39" dur="3.54">the big banks could potentially be</text>
  <text start="565.15" dur="6.3">facing</text>
  <text start="565.93" dur="8.099">a complete catastrophic loss which is</text>
  <text start="571.45" dur="5.55">going to impact their balance sheet for</text>
  <text start="574.029" dur="5.911">instance Wells Fargo is sitting on more</text>
  <text start="577" dur="5.73">than 17 billion in loans to the oil and</text>
  <text start="579.94" dur="5.06">gas sector the bank is setting aside 1.2</text>
  <text start="582.73" dur="4.859">billion in reserves to cover losses</text>
  <text start="585" dur="5.44">because of the deterioration in the</text>
  <text start="587.589" dur="6.451">energy sector JPMorgan Chase is setting</text>
  <text start="590.44" dur="5.94">aside an extra 124 million to come to</text>
  <text start="594.04" dur="5.489">cover potential losses in its oil and</text>
  <text start="596.38" dur="7.29">gas loans it warned that the figure</text>
  <text start="599.529" dur="5.941">could rise to about 750 million so</text>
  <text start="603.67" dur="5.16">everything that they&amp;#39;re giving us right</text>
  <text start="605.47" dur="7.59">now I would double it we&amp;#39;re also see</text>
  <text start="608.83" dur="6.99">Citigroup they&amp;#39;re up to 300 million and</text>
  <text start="613.06" dur="5.7">they&amp;#39;re also saying this number could go</text>
  <text start="615.82" dur="5.22">much much higher so right now the banks</text>
  <text start="618.76" dur="4.94">are telling the public that everything</text>
  <text start="621.04" dur="6.06">is contained now we&amp;#39;ve heard this before</text>
  <text start="623.7" dur="6.19">back in 2008 with the subprime crisis</text>
  <text start="627.1" dur="4.26">where the Fed came out the banks came</text>
  <text start="629.89" dur="4.29">out and said don&amp;#39;t worry about it</text>
  <text start="631.36" dur="7.83">everything is contained which tells us</text>
  <text start="634.18" dur="8.04">it&amp;#39;s not contained and what this means</text>
  <text start="639.19" dur="6.12">is that this is going to be a complete</text>
  <text start="642.22" dur="5.7">and full breakdown of the entire banking</text>
  <text start="645.31" dur="4.56">system there&amp;#39;s going to be huge losses</text>
  <text start="647.92" dur="5.46">because we&amp;#39;re seeing the oil prices</text>
  <text start="649.87" dur="6.06">continually drop and I don&amp;#39;t see it</text>
  <text start="653.38" dur="6.09">going up anytime soon at this point the</text>
  <text start="655.93" dur="6.45">IMF is out there and they are basically</text>
  <text start="659.47" dur="6.51">we were reworking their global outlook</text>
  <text start="662.38" dur="7.5">for 2016 and they&amp;#39;ve cut it once again</text>
  <text start="665.98" dur="5.46">by 0.2% so instead of having an economic</text>
  <text start="669.88" dur="3">growth of three-point-six percent they</text>
  <text start="671.44" dur="4.019">lowered at the three point four percent</text>
  <text start="672.88" dur="5.94">but we have to look at the IMF record</text>
  <text start="675.459" dur="7.591">when have they ever been right with</text>
  <text start="678.82" dur="5.579">their predictions not once and every</text>
  <text start="683.05" dur="4.349">time they come out with a prediction for</text>
  <text start="684.399" dur="4.351">the new year it is always the opposite</text>
  <text start="687.399" dur="4.351">so if we&amp;#39;re seeing three-point-four</text>
  <text start="688.75" dur="6.93">percent we can expect it to be about 1.7</text>
  <text start="691.75" dur="5.779">percent or lower and we can see that we</text>
  <text start="695.68" dur="4.14">are definitely heading in this direction</text>
  <text start="697.529" dur="4.511">very very fast</text>
  <text start="699.82" dur="3.6">collapse right now is moving a lot</text>
  <text start="702.04" dur="4.29">faster than I believe the central</text>
  <text start="703.42" dur="5.64">bankers want it to happen and they are</text>
  <text start="706.33" dur="7.94">definitely realizing that this moving</text>
  <text start="709.06" dur="8.22">forward at a rapid accelerated speed and</text>
  <text start="714.27" dur="7.24">they&amp;#39;re worried about this because they</text>
  <text start="717.28" dur="7.32">realize that they have to control what</text>
  <text start="721.51" dur="5.67">is going to happen in this economy they</text>
  <text start="724.6" dur="4.32">need to bring it down when they want to</text>
  <text start="727.18" dur="4.92">bring it down and when they do bring it</text>
  <text start="728.92" dur="5.54">down or it falls by itself because they</text>
  <text start="732.1" dur="6.21">lose control it&amp;#39;s going to be worse than</text>
  <text start="734.46" dur="9.07">2008 much much worse because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="738.31" dur="10.5">seeing right now is that many of the</text>
  <text start="743.53" dur="12.39">bank lenders and bondholders are going</text>
  <text start="748.81" dur="11.55">to default and this might come in 2016</text>
  <text start="755.92" dur="6.81">of this year and when these bank lenders</text>
  <text start="760.36" dur="5.48">and bondholders default it will create</text>
  <text start="762.73" dur="6.36">cross defaults with other securities</text>
  <text start="765.84" dur="8.23">even more importantly most oil price</text>
  <text start="769.09" dur="9.06">hedges price swaps derivatives have also</text>
  <text start="774.07" dur="8.79">cross default provisions so right now</text>
  <text start="778.15" dur="9.06">the counterparty credit risk when it</text>
  <text start="782.86" dur="10.62">begins to escalate is going to see this</text>
  <text start="787.21" dur="8.49">entire system fall apart and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="793.48" dur="5.78">to accelerate and it&amp;#39;s going to have a</text>
  <text start="795.7" dur="6.54">domino effect throughout the economy and</text>
  <text start="799.26" dur="6.85">was very interesting is that zero hedge</text>
  <text start="802.24" dur="8.22">had a story where banks were told by the</text>
  <text start="806.11" dur="6.93">Fed to continually mark oil at 49 to 50</text>
  <text start="810.46" dur="8.09">nine dollars and keep it on their books</text>
  <text start="813.04" dur="8.96">at this price and the Dallas Fed Reserve</text>
  <text start="818.55" dur="7.39">denied this but it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter</text>
  <text start="822" dur="8.38">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that they</text>
  <text start="825.94" dur="7.41">are actually marking their books with</text>
  <text start="830.38" dur="9.06">this oil price</text>
  <text start="833.35" dur="9.63">and they&amp;#39;re doing it and what this means</text>
  <text start="839.44" dur="6.03">is is that they are cooking the books</text>
  <text start="842.98" dur="7.22">they&amp;#39;re lying about what&amp;#39;s really going</text>
  <text start="845.47" dur="7.53">on and when this whole thing falls apart</text>
  <text start="850.2" dur="5.44">the whole thing is going to come</text>
  <text start="853" dur="5.82">crashing down so we seen many many</text>
  <text start="855.64" dur="6.51">aspects of this economy where it&amp;#39;s built</text>
  <text start="858.82" dur="6.92">up on lies it&amp;#39;s built up on manipulation</text>
  <text start="862.15" dur="6.51">it&amp;#39;s built up on a interconnected</text>
  <text start="865.74" dur="5.29">scenario where once it comes down the</text>
  <text start="868.66" dur="5.07">whole thing is going to completely fall</text>
  <text start="871.03" dur="5.46">apart so let&amp;#39;s take this one step</text>
  <text start="873.73" dur="6.18">further a report they came out on</text>
  <text start="876.49" dur="5.91">January eighth was quite shocking</text>
  <text start="879.91" dur="4.67">because the total international reserves</text>
  <text start="882.4" dur="4.44">held by the central banks excluding gold</text>
  <text start="884.58" dur="4.84">expressed in u.s. dollars amounts to</text>
  <text start="886.84" dur="5.67">about 11 trillion dollars as of that</text>
  <text start="889.42" dur="5.46">date the decrease in reserves us amounts</text>
  <text start="892.51" dur="5.16">to precisely one trillion dollars as of</text>
  <text start="894.88" dur="4.95">January eighth this gigantic full of</text>
  <text start="897.67" dur="5.64">about 8.3 one percent of the maximum</text>
  <text start="899.83" dur="6.17">amount of reserves which is 12 trillion</text>
  <text start="903.31" dur="6.44">dollars recorded on August first of 2014</text>
  <text start="906" dur="6.46">took place over the course of 17 months</text>
  <text start="909.75" dur="7.21">whereas the growth of the reserves to</text>
  <text start="912.46" dur="8.67">its maximum figure took 70 years this</text>
  <text start="916.96" dur="7.08">fall in international reserves which one</text>
  <text start="921.13" dur="6.51">from 12 trillion in 17 months to 11</text>
  <text start="924.04" dur="7.02">trillion is an indicator of a worldwide</text>
  <text start="927.64" dur="6.96">economic slump which will become a</text>
  <text start="931.06" dur="6.54">severe depression so when we put all</text>
  <text start="934.6" dur="7.35">these pieces together we see everything</text>
  <text start="937.6" dur="8.37">right now coming to a head now as we</text>
  <text start="941.95" dur="7.41">know the United States plus Germany plus</text>
  <text start="945.97" dur="6.78">Fran&amp;#39;s plus Russia made a deal with Iran</text>
  <text start="949.36" dur="4.88">the p5 plus one and we know that this</text>
  <text start="952.75" dur="5.61">had nothing to do with nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="954.24" dur="5.74">we see already the Iranian banks because</text>
  <text start="958.36" dur="3.12">we have the head of the International</text>
  <text start="959.98" dur="4.77">Affairs of Iranian banks they have</text>
  <text start="961.48" dur="4.92">gathered in Iran central bank and they</text>
  <text start="964.75" dur="2.37">are now preparing to join the Swift</text>
  <text start="966.4" dur="4.74">banking</text>
  <text start="967.12" dur="6.48">system and we can see already the u.s.</text>
  <text start="971.14" dur="5.91">the IMF the central banking staff</text>
  <text start="973.6" dur="6.63">they&amp;#39;re all ready to go in to this</text>
  <text start="977.05" dur="6.33">system and place their natural reserves</text>
  <text start="980.23" dur="4.89">their oil on the US dollar this is what</text>
  <text start="983.38" dur="4.2">the deal was really about this was the</text>
  <text start="985.12" dur="4.43">backroom deal that they were making this</text>
  <text start="987.58" dur="4.47">is why they wanted this so badly</text>
  <text start="989.55" dur="6.43">remember John Kerry came out listen if</text>
  <text start="992.05" dur="7.14">we don&amp;#39;t make this deal with Iran the</text>
  <text start="995.98" dur="4.83">dollar is going to collapse I think at</text>
  <text start="999.19" dur="5.399">this point we&amp;#39;re a little too late for</text>
  <text start="1000.81" dur="8.25">this and I think at this point they</text>
  <text start="1004.589" dur="6.721">realize it that it took way too long the</text>
  <text start="1009.06" dur="5.52">deal was made and this will not prop up</text>
  <text start="1011.31" dur="4.71">the system at this point and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1014.58" dur="3.3">still going to try to get Syria because</text>
  <text start="1016.02" dur="4.44">they believe if they can get Iran if</text>
  <text start="1017.88" dur="4.11">they can get Syria and they can go back</text>
  <text start="1020.46" dur="4.349">into all the Middle Eastern countries</text>
  <text start="1021.99" dur="9.209">they can keep this system propped up and</text>
  <text start="1024.809" dur="9.63">operating long enough to start some type</text>
  <text start="1031.199" dur="6.51">of war this is what they&amp;#39;ve been trying</text>
  <text start="1034.439" dur="7.951">to do and we can see at this point that</text>
  <text start="1037.709" dur="6.781">the economy is deteriorating so fast</text>
  <text start="1042.39" dur="4.77">that they will not be able to stop this</text>
  <text start="1044.49" dur="4.26">and for those who have not prepared you</text>
  <text start="1047.16" dur="4.019">need to start preparing for those who</text>
  <text start="1048.75" dur="5.87">are preparing continue to prepare</text>
