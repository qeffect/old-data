  <text start="62.21" dur="5.49">is October 9th 2017 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="64.909" dur="5.701">the episode is the Cabal just hit a</text>
  <text start="67.7" dur="5.19">brick wall here&amp;#39;s what happened let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="70.61" dur="4.47">get into the economic collapse political</text>
  <text start="72.89" dur="4.32">and geopolitical news now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="75.08" dur="3.51">following Obamacare for quite a while</text>
  <text start="77.21" dur="3.689">and I know the corporate media is trying</text>
  <text start="78.59" dur="3.69">to make it seem like oh all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="80.899" dur="3.061">Obamacare is not going to be doing well</text>
  <text start="82.28" dur="4.53">because they&amp;#39;re trying to get rid of it</text>
  <text start="83.96" dur="5.1">but we know that Obamacare the exchanges</text>
  <text start="86.81" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;ve been all going bankrupt people</text>
  <text start="89.06" dur="4.05">are not joining up premiums have been</text>
  <text start="90.86" dur="4.05">skyrocketing and this is why we track</text>
  <text start="93.11" dur="3.21">these things so they can&amp;#39;t fool us into</text>
  <text start="94.91" dur="3.48">thinking that it&amp;#39;s just happening now</text>
  <text start="96.32" dur="3.53">we&amp;#39;ve been watching all the exchanges</text>
  <text start="98.39" dur="4.14">and half of them have gone bankrupt</text>
  <text start="99.85" dur="5.5">there are a lot more that are on the</text>
  <text start="102.53" dur="5.61">verge of going bankrupt and people just</text>
  <text start="105.35" dur="5.7">cannot afford this insurance it is not</text>
  <text start="108.14" dur="5.429">affordable even though they named the</text>
  <text start="111.05" dur="4.709">bill the Affordable Care Act it&amp;#39;s far</text>
  <text start="113.569" dur="4.59">from it and then we&amp;#39;ve learned that when</text>
  <text start="115.759" dur="4.171">Obama was in office he was manipulating</text>
  <text start="118.159" dur="3.661">the accounting methods he was using</text>
  <text start="119.93" dur="3.54">funds from different areas to fund</text>
  <text start="121.82" dur="3.6">Obamacare to make it look a lot better</text>
  <text start="123.47" dur="5.459">than it really is and we come to find</text>
  <text start="125.42" dur="5.159">out that it&amp;#39;s not as great as they told</text>
  <text start="128.929" dur="5.611">us and we know it wasn&amp;#39;t that great</text>
  <text start="130.579" dur="9.241">because why Congress the government</text>
  <text start="134.54" dur="7.8">officials never took it they kept their</text>
  <text start="139.82" dur="5.16">own if it was so great they would have</text>
  <text start="142.34" dur="4.489">taken it so over the weekend it was</text>
  <text start="144.98" dur="4.5">announced that Trump was going to ditch</text>
  <text start="146.829" dur="5.261">restrictions that ban people from buying</text>
  <text start="149.48" dur="4.77">health insurance across state lines now</text>
  <text start="152.09" dur="4.41">he&amp;#39;s going to allow competition and not</text>
  <text start="154.25" dur="5.43">force you to buy from the state monopoly</text>
  <text start="156.5" dur="6.42">this is going to really basically</text>
  <text start="159.68" dur="5.75">destroy Obamacare right now it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="162.92" dur="5.159">to expedite the death of Obamacare and</text>
  <text start="165.43" dur="4.42">of course this is probably what the game</text>
  <text start="168.079" dur="4.231">is all about it&amp;#39;s to get rid of it</text>
  <text start="169.85" dur="4.199">because we can see that Congress didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="172.31" dur="4.08">vote to get rid of it they decided to</text>
  <text start="174.049" dur="5.871">keep it get let those people pay a</text>
  <text start="176.39" dur="7.379">penalty give the American population</text>
  <text start="179.92" dur="6.31">terrible terrible health coverage now of</text>
  <text start="183.769" dur="3.271">course the argument is well the</text>
  <text start="186.23" dur="2.819">government is paying</text>
  <text start="187.04" dur="5.009">for all these people and these people</text>
  <text start="189.049" dur="5.97">can get health insurance well that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="192.049" dur="4.681">small select group what about all the</text>
  <text start="195.019" dur="4.621">other groups I mean you can&amp;#39;t create</text>
  <text start="196.73" dur="5.58">something that only helps a certain</text>
  <text start="199.64" dur="4.65">group of individuals if you&amp;#39;re gonna do</text>
  <text start="202.31" dur="4.53">something for the people you have to</text>
  <text start="204.29" dur="5.039">look at the entire picture and you have</text>
  <text start="206.84" dur="3.72">to say okay so the people who couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="209.329" dur="3.061">get insurance who can&amp;#39;t afford insurance</text>
  <text start="210.56" dur="4.2">and the government the taxpayers I</text>
  <text start="212.39" dur="5.429">should say they&amp;#39;re paying for the</text>
  <text start="214.76" dur="5.22">insurance that group loves it the middle</text>
  <text start="217.819" dur="4.861">class where they might have their own</text>
  <text start="219.98" dur="4.349">business or their employers not paying</text>
  <text start="222.68" dur="4.8">for it they can&amp;#39;t afford it and that</text>
  <text start="224.329" dur="6.03">group is gigantic millions and millions</text>
  <text start="227.48" dur="5.039">and millions of people and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="230.359" dur="3.69">seeing here is we need something that</text>
  <text start="232.519" dur="3.211">works for the people and the only way</text>
  <text start="234.049" dur="3.84">that we&amp;#39;ll find something that works for</text>
  <text start="235.73" dur="4.439">the people is if the government</text>
  <text start="237.889" dur="5.761">officials I&amp;#39;m talking about the people</text>
  <text start="240.169" dur="6.96">in Congress the President and the rest</text>
  <text start="243.65" dur="5.61">take it once it&amp;#39;s established if they</text>
  <text start="247.129" dur="4.411">don&amp;#39;t take it you know right off the bat</text>
  <text start="249.26" dur="3.3">it is not good for the people whatsoever</text>
  <text start="251.54" dur="3.659">because if they want to keep their own</text>
  <text start="252.56" dur="4.649">you know right there and then that</text>
  <text start="255.199" dur="4.801">theirs is better than what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="257.209" dur="4.941">trying to sell you we see that Google</text>
  <text start="260" dur="5.669">has all of a sudden discovered</text>
  <text start="262.15" dur="6.22">questionable Russian ads and they said</text>
  <text start="265.669" dur="4.861">these ads were running door during the</text>
  <text start="268.37" dur="3.72">election and they&amp;#39;re saying that there</text>
  <text start="270.53" dur="3.9">was a hundred thousand dollars worth of</text>
  <text start="272.09" dur="3.87">questionable ads and of course all of a</text>
  <text start="274.43" dur="3.66">sudden they&amp;#39;re finding all this</text>
  <text start="275.96" dur="4.11">information out and we know what is</text>
  <text start="278.09" dur="5.46">really going on here they&amp;#39;re just trying</text>
  <text start="280.07" dur="6.089">to find anything to show that Russia was</text>
  <text start="283.55" dur="3.69">pushing the agenda to manipulate the</text>
  <text start="286.159" dur="3.69">elections and I&amp;#39;m gonna tell you right</text>
  <text start="287.24" dur="5.429">now there&amp;#39;s no way by running these ads</text>
  <text start="289.849" dur="4.951">that they convinced anyone of who to</text>
  <text start="292.669" dur="3.901">vote for because people saw what was</text>
  <text start="294.8" dur="4.589">really going on people understood what</text>
  <text start="296.57" dur="4.529">was really going on and they voted the</text>
  <text start="299.389" dur="3.931">way they wanted to voted that the way</text>
  <text start="301.099" dur="3.721">they wanted to vote and even if you look</text>
  <text start="303.32" dur="4.14">at this we know the whole election was</text>
  <text start="304.82" dur="5.339">completely manipulated because Clinton</text>
  <text start="307.46" dur="5.31">she got the popular vote so if you</text>
  <text start="310.159" dur="4.771">really look at this the popular vote</text>
  <text start="312.77" dur="5.34">went to Clinton these ads did nothing</text>
  <text start="314.93" dur="5.73">it was the Electoral College that</text>
  <text start="318.11" dur="6.03">allowed Trump to become</text>
  <text start="320.66" dur="5.64">and again the people really don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="324.14" dur="3.93">say because the Electoral College kind</text>
  <text start="326.3" dur="4.95">of went the opposite direction of what</text>
  <text start="328.07" dur="6.15">the popular vote said so we could see</text>
  <text start="331.25" dur="5.1">right down this is meaningless of what</text>
  <text start="334.22" dur="4.82">they&amp;#39;re saying here now we know that</text>
  <text start="336.35" dur="5.79">catalonia they&amp;#39;re going to be trying to</text>
  <text start="339.04" dur="5.08">separate themselves from Spain France</text>
  <text start="342.14" dur="6.33">right now is saying they will not</text>
  <text start="344.12" dur="7.44">recognize Catalonia if it unilaterally</text>
  <text start="348.47" dur="5.04">declares independence and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="351.56" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re not going to recognize it we see</text>
  <text start="353.51" dur="3.78">that big banks they&amp;#39;re moving their</text>
  <text start="355.13" dur="4.02">headquarters out of Catalonia right now</text>
  <text start="357.29" dur="2.88">Spain third largest bank has said it</text>
  <text start="359.15" dur="3.39">will move its headquarters from</text>
  <text start="360.17" dur="6.15">Catalonia and it&amp;#39;s going to be moving to</text>
  <text start="362.54" dur="5.91">different areas inside of Spain we see</text>
  <text start="366.32" dur="3.72">there&amp;#39;s about three different banks that</text>
  <text start="368.45" dur="3.33">are gonna be doing this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="370.04" dur="3.45">getting prepared for what is coming it</text>
  <text start="371.78" dur="3.18">this is what it looks like now Martin</text>
  <text start="373.49" dur="4.08">Armstrong is out there and saying listen</text>
  <text start="374.96" dur="5.64">you see the way the Spanish government</text>
  <text start="377.57" dur="5.19">reacted when Catalonia wanted to have a</text>
  <text start="380.6" dur="6.36">referendum and you saw how they came</text>
  <text start="382.76" dur="6.42">down and they forced people into you</text>
  <text start="386.96" dur="4.38">know forced them away from the</text>
  <text start="389.18" dur="6.54">referendum and they came down hard on</text>
  <text start="391.34" dur="6.51">the people he says when things in the</text>
  <text start="395.72" dur="5.22">world the global economy starts to break</text>
  <text start="397.85" dur="5.1">down and the people aren&amp;#39;t doing what</text>
  <text start="400.94" dur="3.84">the government says that you you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="402.95" dur="3.96">going to see how the government reacts</text>
  <text start="404.78" dur="5.21">they&amp;#39;re gonna come down on the people he</text>
  <text start="406.91" dur="7.31">says this is a blueprint of how all</text>
  <text start="409.99" dur="6.22">governments will act during stressful</text>
  <text start="414.22" dur="4.18">situations they&amp;#39;re not gonna work with</text>
  <text start="416.21" dur="4.59">the people they&amp;#39;re gonna come down hard</text>
  <text start="418.4" dur="4.62">on the people if you don&amp;#39;t do what they</text>
  <text start="420.8" dur="4.14">say now remember governments they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="423.02" dur="4.65">supposed to be elected while they are</text>
  <text start="424.94" dur="5.37">elected most in some cases some are</text>
  <text start="427.67" dur="4.97">manipulated but they&amp;#39;re so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="430.31" dur="5.04">supposed to be working for the people</text>
  <text start="432.64" dur="4.48">they&amp;#39;re supposed to be part of the</text>
  <text start="435.35" dur="4.2">people they&amp;#39;re not supposed to be going</text>
  <text start="437.12" dur="4.8">against the people but you can see at</text>
  <text start="439.55" dur="5.85">this point our governments today around</text>
  <text start="441.92" dur="6.33">the world well they&amp;#39;re preparing they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="445.4" dur="4.32">always been preparing for when the</text>
  <text start="448.25" dur="2.85">economy comes down because they know</text>
  <text start="449.72" dur="2.97">that there&amp;#39;s going to be certain</text>
  <text start="451.1" dur="3.149">situation especially in big cities where</text>
  <text start="452.69" dur="3.629">people are going to</text>
  <text start="454.249" dur="3.33">people going to be very upset and things</text>
  <text start="456.319" dur="4.17">are going to get out of hand and this is</text>
  <text start="457.579" dur="6.57">why you see them ramping up on weapons</text>
  <text start="460.489" dur="7.29">on water cannons and having the police</text>
  <text start="464.149" dur="6.15">look like military we see German</text>
  <text start="467.779" dur="4.44">Chancellor Angela Merkel admitted last</text>
  <text start="470.299" dur="5.13">year that she had lost control of the</text>
  <text start="472.219" dur="4.65">German refugee crisis after adopting an</text>
  <text start="475.429" dur="3.75">open-door policy</text>
  <text start="476.869" dur="4.41">now as the refugees came into Germany</text>
  <text start="479.179" dur="5.34">there was a spike in crime there was</text>
  <text start="481.279" dur="5.7">rioting and we see right now that with</text>
  <text start="484.519" dur="5.91">her new coalition they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="486.979" dur="5.01">implement other rules where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="490.429" dur="4.44">still going to be bringing in these</text>
  <text start="491.989" dur="4.14">refugees but they&amp;#39;re gonna cap it well</text>
  <text start="494.869" dur="3.42">this is what they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="496.129" dur="3.99">gonna be capping it at 200 thousand</text>
  <text start="498.289" dur="4.11">people a year and what did they see</text>
  <text start="500.119" dur="5.43">happen during this period of time they</text>
  <text start="502.399" dur="4.83">see that this open-door policy there was</text>
  <text start="505.549" dur="3.33">about one hundred and forty two thousand</text>
  <text start="507.229" dur="4.65">crimes during the first six months of</text>
  <text start="508.879" dur="5.88">2016 including several high-profile</text>
  <text start="511.879" dur="5.01">sexual assaults during all of this and</text>
  <text start="514.759" dur="4.351">the country kind of ignored it because</text>
  <text start="516.889" dur="3.96">they didn&amp;#39;t want to recognize that this</text>
  <text start="519.11" dur="3.69">was a problem and we understand and we</text>
  <text start="520.849" dur="4.381">talked about the refugee crisis in depth</text>
  <text start="522.8" dur="4.979">in other reports where this was all</text>
  <text start="525.23" dur="6.089">planned because you have to remember the</text>
  <text start="527.779" dur="5.971">globalists plan was to make all the</text>
  <text start="531.319" dur="5.13">countries look the same remember where</text>
  <text start="533.75" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re passing the TTIP the TPP and the</text>
  <text start="536.449" dur="5.041">globalist plan in the end was to have a</text>
  <text start="539.36" dur="4.409">one-world government and they wanted to</text>
  <text start="541.49" dur="4.289">blend all the countries into one and</text>
  <text start="543.769" dur="4.081">this is why they were pushing their</text>
  <text start="545.779" dur="6.24">agenda this is why they were releasing</text>
  <text start="547.85" dur="5.4">the refugees from Turkey and other areas</text>
  <text start="552.019" dur="4.56">and of course the only reason we had</text>
  <text start="553.25" dur="5.91">refugees is because the Cabal was in</text>
  <text start="556.579" dur="4.74">these areas creating war but they were</text>
  <text start="559.16" dur="4.71">trying to blend everything so when they</text>
  <text start="561.319" dur="4.89">took full control the identity of each</text>
  <text start="563.87" dur="4.05">country would have been lost and people</text>
  <text start="566.209" dur="3.75">revolted against us this is not what</text>
  <text start="567.92" dur="3.599">people wanted but they didn&amp;#39;t care what</text>
  <text start="569.959" dur="4.591">people wanted they were pushing their</text>
  <text start="571.519" dur="5.94">agenda now out in North Korea we can see</text>

  <text start="644.95" dur="6.15">at this point I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="648.01" dur="5.19">so it looks like behind all of this</text>
  <text start="651.1" dur="4.53">behind all the propaganda that&amp;#39;s coming</text>

  <text start="672.779" dur="7.511">NATO should get involved in Libya</text>

  <text start="683.2" dur="4.02">factions and we don&amp;#39;t want the same</text>
  <text start="685.66" dur="4.56">thing happening in Syria now what</text>
  <text start="687.22" dur="6.3">they&amp;#39;re really saying is that Russia is</text>
  <text start="690.22" dur="6.27">trying to formulate and create peace in</text>
  <text start="693.52" dur="5.46">Libya and get rid of the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="696.49" dur="4.08">which basically they&amp;#39;re not really there</text>
  <text start="698.98" dur="4.95">that much anymore they&amp;#39;re being wiped</text>
  <text start="700.57" dur="5.4">out left and right they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="703.93" dur="4.409">to happen and Stoltenberg is saying that</text>
  <text start="705.97" dur="7.23">NATO should get involved in the</text>
  <text start="708.339" dur="6.75">situation now again we have Trump who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="713.2" dur="3.72">saying that we are not doing anything</text>
  <text start="715.089" dur="4.111">with Libya we still have a cabal that</text>
  <text start="716.92" dur="3.16">still wants Libya they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="719.2" dur="2.98">lose</text>
  <text start="720.08" dur="4.35">all the different countries where they</text>
  <text start="722.18" dur="4.62">had regime change because again they</text>
  <text start="724.43" dur="4.68">still think and in their heads they</text>
  <text start="726.8" dur="3.99">still believe that they&amp;#39;re gonna be able</text>
  <text start="729.11" dur="4.26">to have this one-world government this</text>
  <text start="730.79" dur="4.71">is just a minor setback and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="733.37" dur="5.1">still pushing for it they haven&amp;#39;t given</text>
  <text start="735.5" dur="7.04">up we see the Islamic state they are</text>
  <text start="738.47" dur="8.09">collapsing in Syria and Iraq and it is</text>
  <text start="742.54" dur="8.17">accelerating right now they are losing</text>
  <text start="746.56" dur="7.06">swaths of land right now there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="750.71" dur="7.23">that can stop this Russia and Syria the</text>
  <text start="753.62" dur="6.45">Iraqi forces they are removing the paid</text>
  <text start="757.94" dur="4.5">mercenaries from all over the place we</text>
  <text start="760.07" dur="4.56">see that more than a thousand fled their</text>
  <text start="762.44" dur="4.77">crumbling Iraqi stronghold they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="764.63" dur="4.47">fleeing Syria and they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="767.21" dur="4.95">looking back they&amp;#39;re just running now</text>
  <text start="769.1" dur="6.72">something very very interesting happen</text>
  <text start="772.16" dur="7.77">and this is where the Cabal hits the</text>
  <text start="775.82" dur="7.46">brick wall now during Obama&amp;#39;s term where</text>
  <text start="779.93" dur="6.39">they were trying to set up the Kurds and</text>
  <text start="783.28" dur="4.96">they were trying to separate Syria Iraq</text>
  <text start="786.32" dur="3.96">and they&amp;#39;re still trying to do this they</text>
  <text start="788.24" dur="3.93">had the referendum the independence</text>
  <text start="790.28" dur="4.25">referendum and you know they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="792.17" dur="5.94">yes we voted to separate ourselves from</text>
  <text start="794.53" dur="6.79">Syria and Iraq and set up our own Kurd</text>
  <text start="798.11" dur="5.07">territory we know back then during the</text>
  <text start="801.32" dur="5.84">Obama administration in July of 2016 the</text>
  <text start="803.18" dur="7.2">United States agreed to pay salaries to</text>
  <text start="807.16" dur="4.78">36,000 Kurdish fighters and of course</text>
  <text start="810.38" dur="3.03">they said well we&amp;#39;re paying them to</text>
  <text start="811.94" dur="4.11">battle the Islamic state but we know</text>
  <text start="813.41" dur="5.91">today and we knew back then that the</text>
  <text start="816.05" dur="4.56">Islamic state was created and paid for</text>
  <text start="819.32" dur="5.07">by the United States and the coalition</text>
  <text start="820.61" dur="5.28">forces and the Kurds were being paid by</text>
  <text start="824.39" dur="4.17">the United States and the coalition</text>
  <text start="825.89" dur="5.73">forces and they weren&amp;#39;t really fighting</text>
  <text start="828.56" dur="6.08">the Islamic state they were paying them</text>
  <text start="831.62" dur="6">because they were creating an army</text>
  <text start="834.64" dur="6.52">because they needed an army when they</text>
  <text start="837.62" dur="5.22">separated these pieces of land this is</text>
  <text start="841.16" dur="4.26">why they created the bases this is why</text>
  <text start="842.84" dur="5.16">the United States forces were there to</text>
  <text start="845.42" dur="6.09">protect this area what is happening</text>
  <text start="848" dur="5.67">right now is Trump is saying we are not</text>
  <text start="851.51" dur="6.15">paying these</text>
  <text start="853.67" dur="7.2">it has come to an end and we are not</text>
  <text start="857.66" dur="6.57">renewing it so all these military</text>
  <text start="860.87" dur="5.25">soldiers in the Kurd areas they are no</text>
  <text start="864.23" dur="4.29">longer getting paid by the United States</text>
  <text start="866.12" dur="5.79">now the intelligent agencies they might</text>
  <text start="868.52" dur="6.42">be doing this covertly but out in front</text>
  <text start="871.91" dur="5.91">they are no longer getting paid secondly</text>
  <text start="874.94" dur="6.93">the Trump administration said they will</text>
  <text start="877.82" dur="7.26">not recognize last month&amp;#39;s non-binding</text>
  <text start="881.87" dur="6">referendum that the Kurds held they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="885.08" dur="7.02">taken Baghdad side in the dispute and</text>
  <text start="887.87" dur="7.85">refused to recognize the results so this</text>
  <text start="892.1" dur="6.75">means that the Kurds at this point</text>
  <text start="895.72" dur="5.71">unless something happens will not be</text>
  <text start="898.85" dur="5.13">declaring independence Russia&amp;#39;s against</text>
  <text start="901.43" dur="3.93">it china&amp;#39;s against it syria&amp;#39;s against it</text>
  <text start="903.98" dur="4.05">the people of these countries are</text>
  <text start="905.36" dur="5.85">against it the only people that were</text>
  <text start="908.03" dur="4.83">four were the Cabal and the 36 thousand</text>
  <text start="911.21" dur="3.81">people they were paying now they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="912.86" dur="4.38">getting paid we have a completely</text>
  <text start="915.02" dur="6.06">different story so it looks like the</text>
  <text start="917.24" dur="7.26">Cabal has hit a brick wall what are they</text>
  <text start="921.08" dur="5.88">going to do next because it looks like</text>
  <text start="924.5" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re losing the Middle East and every</text>
  <text start="926.96" dur="5.73">day that passes it&amp;#39;s getting worse and</text>
  <text start="929.18" dur="5.22">worse for them North Korea they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="932.69" dur="4.17">gotten the war they wanted it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="934.4" dur="5.66">worse and worse as time goes on now</text>
  <text start="936.86" dur="7.11">something very interesting happen the</text>
  <text start="940.06" dur="7.51">drone program of the United States the</text>
  <text start="943.97" dur="6.66">u.s. reaper and Predator drones they</text>
  <text start="947.57" dur="6.8">have a major problem now they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="950.63" dur="8.34">there is a virus in these systems and</text>
  <text start="954.37" dur="7.75">the virus is recording the keystrokes</text>
  <text start="958.97" dur="4.92">and recording what is going on now this</text>
  <text start="962.12" dur="4.05">virus was discovered and of course</text>
  <text start="963.89" dur="4.65">Kaspersky is being blamed for this</text>
  <text start="966.17" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re saying I see they got into our</text>
  <text start="968.54" dur="4.65">systems they&amp;#39;re recording what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="970.28" dur="6.48">doing but I really believe that this is</text>
  <text start="973.19" dur="5.76">the intelligent agencies where they</text>
  <text start="976.76" dur="6.69">wanted to always have control of these</text>
  <text start="978.95" dur="6.75">systems now what they&amp;#39;ve done they tried</text>
  <text start="983.45" dur="3.96">to wipe out the virus and every time</text>
  <text start="985.7" dur="4.53">they do the virus comes</text>
  <text start="987.41" dur="5.52">back so it must be hard-coded into the</text>
  <text start="990.23" dur="4.469">chips or something it&amp;#39;s not I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="992.93" dur="3.75">think it&amp;#39;s just software based I think</text>
  <text start="994.699" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s hard-coded and this is why they</text>
  <text start="996.68" dur="5.69">can&amp;#39;t wipe it out because it&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="998.779" dur="6.3">some type of backdoor system buried</text>
  <text start="1002.37" dur="5.44">beneath anything that they know of and</text>
  <text start="1005.079" dur="4.86">once the system&amp;#39;s rebooted and maybe</text>
  <text start="1007.81" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s wiped out and rebooted back up the</text>
  <text start="1009.939" dur="4.921">whole system the virus all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="1012.43" dur="4.769">comes back and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="1014.86" dur="5.43">maybe the intelligence agencies were</text>
  <text start="1017.199" dur="5.521">using this to control what was going on</text>
  <text start="1020.29" dur="5.909">monitor what was going on and maybe one</text>
  <text start="1022.72" dur="5.099">day take control of the drones if needed</text>
  <text start="1026.199" dur="3.6">to create maybe some type of false flag</text>
  <text start="1027.819" dur="4.02">or something like that but this is very</text>
  <text start="1029.799" dur="4.051">interesting that this is happening of</text>
  <text start="1031.839" dur="3.36">course what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1033.85" dur="3">turning around and saying this must be</text>
  <text start="1035.199" dur="3.301">Russia of course is what they do I</text>
  <text start="1036.85" dur="3.3">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if they even say</text>
  <text start="1038.5" dur="4.319">it was North Korea but I think Russia</text>
  <text start="1040.15" dur="5.909">they&amp;#39;re trying to blame this on Russia</text>
  <text start="1042.819" dur="5.071">Kaspersky and this is what Kaspersky is</text>
  <text start="1046.059" dur="6.391">doing they&amp;#39;re infiltrating the drone</text>
  <text start="1047.89" dur="6.69">systems but once again we know that the</text>
  <text start="1052.45" dur="4.83">NSA the intelligence agencies they</text>
  <text start="1054.58" dur="5.13">created through vault 7 all of these</text>
  <text start="1057.28" dur="5.269">different malware&amp;#39;s and viruses that are</text>
  <text start="1059.71" dur="5.64">not just software based but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1062.549" dur="5.801">hard-coded into the system because the</text>
  <text start="1065.35" dur="6.12">manufacturers got instructions from them</text>
  <text start="1068.35" dur="6.78">to plant these things in there for of</text>
  <text start="1071.47" dur="6.18">course national security now this again</text>
  <text start="1075.13" dur="4.799">might be used for something in the</text>
  <text start="1077.65" dur="4.47">future and they&amp;#39;ve been trying to get</text>
  <text start="1079.929" dur="4.021">rid of it and they cannot get rid of it</text>
  <text start="1082.12" dur="5.309">whatsoever they don&amp;#39;t know who created</text>
  <text start="1083.95" dur="4.83">the virus and again the virus they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1087.429" dur="4.681">get rid of it they can&amp;#39;t clean the</text>
  <text start="1088.78" dur="5.93">systems and they can&amp;#39;t operate the</text>
  <text start="1092.11" dur="5.04">drones without the virus present so</text>
  <text start="1094.71" dur="4.66">again we&amp;#39;re on the lookout to see if</text>
  <text start="1097.15" dur="4.2">something does happen something might</text>
  <text start="1099.37" dur="4.41">happen they might blame maybe they were</text>
  <text start="1101.35" dur="4.14">planning on saying that Russia took</text>
  <text start="1103.78" dur="4.529">control of the drones and the drones</text>
  <text start="1105.49" dur="4.71">turned around and fired on the American</text>
  <text start="1108.309" dur="5.341">soldiers or anything like that but we</text>
  <text start="1110.2" dur="5.07">see right now that everything that the</text>
  <text start="1113.65" dur="4.47">Cabal has been doing over the many many</text>
  <text start="1115.27" dur="5.039">years a lot of it is coming out now a</text>
  <text start="1118.12" dur="3.19">lot of people are recognizing it a lot</text>
