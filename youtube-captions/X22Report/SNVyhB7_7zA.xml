  <text start="52.719" dur="5.491">hi and welcome you&amp;#39;re listening to the</text>
  <text start="55.93" dur="7.369">x22 report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.21" dur="8.4">episode 1274 and today&amp;#39;s date is May 8th</text>
  <text start="63.299" dur="5.441">2017 and part of the episode is central</text>
  <text start="66.61" dur="4.89">bank&amp;#39;s prep for the collapse by shifting</text>
  <text start="68.74" dur="5.519">the narrative let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="71.5" dur="4.38">economic collapse financial news now in</text>
  <text start="74.259" dur="4.831">the last couple of reports we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="75.88" dur="5.279">talking about home Capital Group and we</text>
  <text start="79.09" dur="4.86">understand they received a bailout of</text>
  <text start="81.159" dur="4.531">about 2 billion or so they already went</text>
  <text start="83.95" dur="4.35">through the 1 billion already and</text>
  <text start="85.69" dur="5.7">they&amp;#39;re almost halfway through the other</text>
  <text start="88.3" dur="5.459">billion at this point but something very</text>
  <text start="91.39" dur="6.72">interesting is that people are realizing</text>
  <text start="93.759" dur="7.201">that this financial institution is in</text>
  <text start="98.11" dur="5.97">big big trouble and people are pulling</text>
  <text start="100.96" dur="6.51">their funds out of this system right</text>
  <text start="104.08" dur="5.459">here because they understand that when</text>
  <text start="107.47" dur="5.31">this goes down they&amp;#39;re going to lose</text>
  <text start="109.539" dur="5.521">their money now those people who are not</text>
  <text start="112.78" dur="4.319">pulling it out well they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="115.06" dur="4.08">lose pretty much everything if they</text>
  <text start="117.099" dur="5.211">don&amp;#39;t do this right now and why wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="119.14" dur="5.759">you why would you leave your funds there</text>
  <text start="122.31" dur="6.88">because when we look at this and we go</text>
  <text start="124.899" dur="7.17">back to April 28th there was about five</text>
  <text start="129.19" dur="7.4">hundred and twenty-one million dollars</text>
  <text start="132.069" dur="9.601">in the system May 1st it dropped down to</text>
  <text start="136.59" dur="7.03">391 million as of May 8th today people</text>
  <text start="141.67" dur="4.89">have been taking their funds their</text>
  <text start="143.62" dur="4.74">currency out of the bank and it has</text>
  <text start="146.56" dur="5.28">dropped to a hundred and ninety two</text>
  <text start="148.36" dur="6.959">million and you can see just from May</text>
  <text start="151.84" dur="6.869">1st to May 8th well it has really</text>
  <text start="155.319" dur="8.341">changed actually right now the bank is</text>
  <text start="158.709" dur="7.051">down by 90 percent since March 28th this</text>
  <text start="163.66" dur="4.2">is what a bank run looks like where</text>
  <text start="165.76" dur="4.02">people come in and they try to get as</text>
  <text start="167.86" dur="4.53">much as they possibly can before the</text>
  <text start="169.78" dur="5.73">system collapses and we&amp;#39;re watching this</text>
  <text start="172.39" dur="6.209">right now and we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="175.51" dur="5.1">that most likely this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="178.599" dur="5.731">going to collapse unless they get an</text>
  <text start="180.61" dur="5.58">influx of some other type of bailout to</text>
  <text start="184.33" dur="3.18">help it along here because as</text>
  <text start="186.19" dur="3.96">more and more individuals take their</text>
  <text start="187.51" dur="4.14">funds out of the system the system will</text>
  <text start="190.15" dur="4.38">not be able to survive we saw this in</text>
  <text start="191.65" dur="4.8">Greece where the people realize may</text>
  <text start="194.53" dur="2.55">understood that okay we see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="196.45" dur="2.67">happening here</text>
  <text start="197.08" dur="5.25">let&amp;#39;s get as much as we can out of the</text>
  <text start="199.12" dur="6">system Cyprus wasn&amp;#39;t as lucky so when</text>
  <text start="202.33" dur="4.65">the system starts to come down you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="205.12" dur="3.57">want to be on the end we&amp;#39;re like oh you</text>
  <text start="206.98" dur="3.72">know should I go to the bank and should</text>
  <text start="208.69" dur="4.44">I take my currency out because at that</text>
  <text start="210.7" dur="5.46">point most likely it&amp;#39;s going to be too</text>
  <text start="213.13" dur="4.56">late because once just one bank and then</text>
  <text start="216.16" dur="5.1">another bank and another bank start to</text>
  <text start="217.69" dur="6.3">fail you know right there and then the</text>
  <text start="221.26" dur="5.12">first number of people who run to the</text>
  <text start="223.99" dur="4.98">bank they will get their funds the rest</text>
  <text start="226.38" dur="5.2">they will never get it and we can see</text>
  <text start="228.97" dur="4.38">already the 192 million most likely</text>
  <text start="231.58" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re going to shut it down and say</text>
  <text start="233.35" dur="4.65">okay nobody can take out anymore they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="235.9" dur="3.54">probably going to stop it at some point</text>
  <text start="238" dur="3.63">and it looks like we&amp;#39;re getting very</text>
  <text start="239.44" dur="3.72">close to that so you don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="241.63" dur="3.18">behind the curve you want to be ahead of</text>
  <text start="243.16" dur="4.74">the curve and you want to make sure that</text>
  <text start="244.81" dur="5.28">you have the ability to take your funds</text>
  <text start="247.9" dur="4.05">out of it this is why my personal</text>
  <text start="250.09" dur="4.68">opinion is is that you only keep as much</text>
  <text start="251.95" dur="4.71">as you need in the system because once</text>
  <text start="254.77" dur="3.719">it collapses once the whole thing starts</text>
  <text start="256.66" dur="5.16">to fall apart it&amp;#39;s going to be very</text>
  <text start="258.489" dur="5.611">difficult to get to your funds we are</text>
  <text start="261.82" dur="4.08">now seeing that because of what is</text>
  <text start="264.1" dur="5.52">happening in retail which we discussed</text>
  <text start="265.9" dur="5.4">that no online sales is not taking over</text>
  <text start="269.62" dur="4.14">for brick-and-mortar just yet it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="271.3" dur="4.92">about eight percent or so of the total</text>
  <text start="273.76" dur="4.95">retail sales what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="276.22" dur="4.74">is retail is collapsing on itself</text>
  <text start="278.71" dur="4.22">because people won&amp;#39;t they don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="280.96" dur="5.01">job they don&amp;#39;t have the extra money and</text>
  <text start="282.93" dur="5.38">people are not spending this is the big</text>
  <text start="285.97" dur="4.59">problem even though they tell us that</text>
  <text start="288.31" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;re at four point four percent this is</text>
  <text start="290.56" dur="4.14">a manipulated number to make you believe</text>
  <text start="292.24" dur="5.55">that we&amp;#39;re at full employment which we</text>
  <text start="294.7" dur="4.62">are not and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="297.79" dur="2.73">because of all these stories that have</text>
  <text start="299.32" dur="3.69">been closing and you have to remember</text>
  <text start="300.52" dur="3.93">how retail is calculated remember</text>
  <text start="303.01" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re going to tell you that retail</text>
  <text start="304.45" dur="4.17">sales are still doing well because just</text>
  <text start="306.85" dur="3.15">because stores closed down and you see</text>
  <text start="308.62" dur="3">them go out of business and let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="310" dur="3.12">they go out of business next week they</text>
  <text start="311.62" dur="3.87">don&amp;#39;t just cut off the sales and say</text>
  <text start="313.12" dur="4.44">okay this store no longer has sales they</text>
  <text start="315.49" dur="3.94">take those sales and they project it out</text>
  <text start="317.56" dur="4.54">for the rest of the year and</text>
  <text start="319.43" dur="4.71">remove it slowly over the year so it</text>
  <text start="322.1" dur="4.2">looks like the economy still doing</text>
  <text start="324.14" dur="3.93">really well when it really isn&amp;#39;t and</text>
  <text start="326.3" dur="2.7">because all these stores that are</text>
  <text start="328.07" dur="3.33">closing we&amp;#39;re going to have a lot of</text>
  <text start="329" dur="4.38">retail space a lot of commercial space</text>
  <text start="331.4" dur="3.39">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="333.38" dur="3.03">commercial real estate loan</text>
  <text start="334.79" dur="3.99">delinquencies well they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="336.41" dur="4.38">rise we&amp;#39;re having a lot of space the</text>
  <text start="338.78" dur="3.9">retailers won&amp;#39;t they can&amp;#39;t pay for this</text>
  <text start="340.79" dur="5.22">space anymore and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="342.68" dur="5.7">a lot of delinquencies and as more and</text>
  <text start="346.01" dur="4.5">more of these retail shops to clare</text>
  <text start="348.38" dur="5.46">bankruptcy it&amp;#39;s just going to grow and</text>
  <text start="350.51" dur="5.46">grow and grow and this is like a domino</text>
  <text start="353.84" dur="4.2">effect we just clicked off clicked off</text>
  <text start="355.97" dur="3.75">the first domino it hit the second</text>
  <text start="358.04" dur="5.64">domino and it&amp;#39;s just going to continue</text>
  <text start="359.72" dur="6.24">on the same thing in Canada with the</text>
  <text start="363.68" dur="5.61">home capital goods this is just the</text>
  <text start="365.96" dur="6.93">first domino to fall and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="369.29" dur="5.46">accelerate as we move forward because we</text>
  <text start="372.89" dur="3.69">have to remember there are so many</text>
  <text start="374.75" dur="4.29">things going on in the economy right now</text>
  <text start="376.58" dur="4.68">where we&amp;#39;re looking at each one of these</text>
  <text start="379.04" dur="6.78">economic sectors and each one has its</text>
  <text start="381.26" dur="6.72">own problems I mean GDP came in at 0.7%</text>
  <text start="385.82" dur="4.53">even if it was one percent or one point</text>
  <text start="387.98" dur="4.11">one percent that is the manipulated</text>
  <text start="390.35" dur="4.29">number that is a disaster</text>
  <text start="392.09" dur="5.67">industrial production down manufacturing</text>
  <text start="394.64" dur="6.42">down we know retail sales down housing</text>
  <text start="397.76" dur="6.27">it has come to a standstill</text>
  <text start="401.06" dur="5.01">the bubbles have reached the top and the</text>
  <text start="404.03" dur="5.34">whole thing&amp;#39;s going to be disaster then</text>
  <text start="406.07" dur="5.1">we have the student loan problem where</text>
  <text start="409.37" dur="4.65">more and more individuals are taking out</text>
  <text start="411.17" dur="4.89">these loans they can&amp;#39;t pay for them they</text>
  <text start="414.02" dur="4.86">can&amp;#39;t find jobs and if they can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="416.06" dur="4.74">jobs they can&amp;#39;t pay for them they modify</text>
  <text start="418.88" dur="3.06">the loans but they still can&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="420.8" dur="2.7">those payments a lot of these</text>
  <text start="421.94" dur="3.93">individuals are living with their</text>
  <text start="423.5" dur="5.49">parents and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="425.87" dur="5.49">is at the Department of Education well</text>
  <text start="428.99" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re having a problem collecting on</text>
  <text start="431.36" dur="3.87">defaulted student loans</text>
  <text start="432.83" dur="5.28">and it has come to a complete standstill</text>
  <text start="435.23" dur="6.21">in the last month leaving an estimated</text>
  <text start="438.11" dur="5.37">91 thousand accounts in limbo when the</text>
  <text start="441.44" dur="3.96">agency ordered the debt collectors under</text>
  <text start="443.48" dur="3.96">contract to stop making collections on</text>
  <text start="445.4" dur="5.37">the accounts now why did this happen</text>
  <text start="447.44" dur="5.91">well it&amp;#39;s a strange turn of events which</text>
  <text start="450.77" dur="4.86">began with a lawsuit filed by two</text>
  <text start="453.35" dur="5.37">collector companies who claimed they</text>
  <text start="455.63" dur="4.53">were unfairly fired by the Obama era</text>
  <text start="458.72" dur="4.26">education department for poor</text>
  <text start="460.16" dur="4.44">performance on March 29th the judge</text>
  <text start="462.98" dur="3.09">issued a temporary restraining order</text>
  <text start="464.6" dur="3.45">that prevented any new defaulted</text>
  <text start="466.07" dur="4.22">borrowers from being assigned to debt</text>
  <text start="468.05" dur="5.52">collectors and put into rehabilitation</text>
  <text start="470.29" dur="5.05">programs on April 21st the government</text>
  <text start="473.57" dur="3.72">ordered the debt collectors involved in</text>
  <text start="475.34" dur="4.5">the suit to stop work altogether on</text>
  <text start="477.29" dur="3.93">default that accounts the Education</text>
  <text start="479.84" dur="3.87">Department and the Justice Department</text>
  <text start="481.22" dur="4.89">are partly to blame for the</text>
  <text start="483.71" dur="5.21">unnecessarily throwing a wrench into the</text>
  <text start="486.11" dur="5.97">entire defaulted loan system meanwhile</text>
  <text start="488.92" dur="6.82">these individuals they are racking up</text>
  <text start="492.08" dur="6.69">ton of charges as more interest accrues</text>
  <text start="495.74" dur="5.13">on their loans and they are going to be</text>
  <text start="498.77" dur="4.32">responsible for this because they are</text>
  <text start="500.87" dur="4.77">not taking it out of their bank accounts</text>
  <text start="503.09" dur="4.65">right now which is completely unfair at</text>
  <text start="505.64" dur="6.06">this point but we can see this whole</text>
  <text start="507.74" dur="6.51">student loan system where individuals</text>
  <text start="511.7" dur="5.37">cannot find high-paying jobs they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="514.25" dur="5.88">pay back their loans it is in trouble</text>
  <text start="517.07" dur="5.279">and it is collapsing right in front of</text>
  <text start="520.13" dur="5.64">us and this is going to be a huge</text>
  <text start="522.349" dur="5.881">problem now Ben Bernanke former Fed</text>
  <text start="525.77" dur="5.13">Chairman he is out there and he is</text>
  <text start="528.23" dur="6.66">trying to explain to us why Trump&amp;#39;s tax</text>
  <text start="530.9" dur="6.69">cuts well it&amp;#39;s not a very good time for</text>
  <text start="534.89" dur="4.47">him to do this now</text>
  <text start="537.59" dur="3.99">does it really matter at this point now</text>
  <text start="539.36" dur="4.71">the economy is collapsing the tax cuts</text>
  <text start="541.58" dur="4.41">aren&amp;#39;t going to do anything and he said</text>
  <text start="544.07" dur="6.69">it would have made more sense to have</text>
  <text start="545.99" dur="7.74">these tax cuts back in 2012 or 2013 very</text>
  <text start="550.76" dur="4.98">interesting but he says I admit there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="553.73" dur="5.22">a lot of people left out of the recovery</text>
  <text start="555.74" dur="6.48">yes just a few were left out of the</text>
  <text start="558.95" dur="5.94">recovery basically it was all done for</text>
  <text start="562.22" dur="4.62">the 1% or above the 1% and the rest of</text>
  <text start="564.89" dur="4.92">the country was completely left out of</text>
  <text start="566.84" dur="5.1">it but he&amp;#39;s trying to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="569.81" dur="5.25">and this was during an interview that</text>
  <text start="571.94" dur="5.07">things look pretty darn good and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="575.06" dur="5.58">saying that the first quarter of this</text>
  <text start="577.01" dur="6.21">year was an aberration and that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="580.64" dur="6.21">the true strength of the economy right</text>
  <text start="583.22" dur="6.66">now and when we look at the u.s. GDP</text>
  <text start="586.85" dur="6.33">growth quarter-on-quarter we and we go</text>
  <text start="589.88" dur="6.66">back to when he was the chairman in the</text>
  <text start="593.18" dur="8.399">Federal Reserve we can see that the GDP</text>
  <text start="596.54" dur="8.669">was around 2% and we entered a recession</text>
  <text start="601.579" dur="5.37">and we look now and we see that the GDP</text>
  <text start="605.209" dur="4.651">numbers the first quarter came in at</text>
  <text start="606.949" dur="5.37">point seven percent and he&amp;#39;s saying this</text>
  <text start="609.86" dur="3.93">is just an aberration now we need to</text>
  <text start="612.319" dur="5.371">remember and we need to go back in time</text>
  <text start="613.79" dur="6.27">to 2008 where he was during this</text>
  <text start="617.69" dur="4.23">enduring an interview he was telling</text>
  <text start="620.06" dur="5.55">everyone how great the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="621.92" dur="5.399">how the economy was strong how people</text>
  <text start="625.61" dur="4.349">don&amp;#39;t have to worry about housing prices</text>
  <text start="627.319" dur="5.25">going down how people don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="629.959" dur="4.771">worry about the economy because there is</text>
  <text start="632.569" dur="4.291">no forecast of any type of recession</text>
  <text start="634.73" dur="4.44">going on whatsoever and if you want to</text>
  <text start="636.86" dur="5.729">see that interview it is on the x-23</text>
  <text start="639.17" dur="4.74">Broadcom site and you can play it right</text>
  <text start="642.589" dur="3.541">on the site or if you want to click you</text>
  <text start="643.91" dur="5.22">can play it on youtube and he explains</text>
  <text start="646.13" dur="5.79">how strong the economy is and when I was</text>
  <text start="649.13" dur="5.49">listening to this it almost sounds</text>
  <text start="651.92" dur="6">exactly what they are saying right now</text>

  <text start="657.92" dur="5.399">convince us of how great the economy is</text>
  <text start="661.189" dur="4.65">and don&amp;#39;t worry about these ridiculous</text>
  <text start="663.319" dur="3.841">manipulated low numbers because we try</text>
  <text start="665.839" dur="3.331">to manipulate them higher and then we</text>
  <text start="667.16" dur="3.479">just couldn&amp;#39;t and don&amp;#39;t worry about them</text>
  <text start="669.17" dur="2.64">because it&amp;#39;s transitory it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="670.639" dur="3.241">aberration</text>
  <text start="671.81" dur="3.899">they really don&amp;#39;t matter because you</text>
  <text start="673.88" dur="4.699">need to believe us the economy is strong</text>
  <text start="675.709" dur="5.88">so we&amp;#39;ve heard from all different Fed</text>
  <text start="678.579" dur="5.5">individuals Fed governors telling us how</text>
  <text start="681.589" dur="5.791">great the economy is how we&amp;#39;re at full</text>
  <text start="684.079" dur="5.671">employment how were the economy&amp;#39;s way</text>
  <text start="687.38" dur="4.62">above its potential how we need these</text>
  <text start="689.75" dur="6.019">interest rate hikes and then we have</text>
  <text start="692" dur="6.63">former Fed governor Kevin wash and he</text>
  <text start="695.769" dur="4.3">basically slammed the Fed during a</text>
  <text start="698.63" dur="3.78">speech delivered at the Hoover Fed</text>
  <text start="700.069" dur="6.57">conference omitting the central bank had</text>
  <text start="702.41" dur="7.2">no real normalization strategy and when</text>
  <text start="706.639" dur="5.521">he looks at the situation and he sees</text>
  <text start="709.61" dur="5.94">what is going on he said the last time I</text>
  <text start="712.16" dur="7.07">saw such uniformity of opinion was just</text>
  <text start="715.55" dur="6.26">before the 2007 crash</text>
  <text start="719.23" dur="4.77">so what is happening here is that the</text>
  <text start="721.81" dur="4.95">Fed they&amp;#39;re trying to get their act</text>
  <text start="724" dur="5.67">together they&amp;#39;re creating this narrative</text>
  <text start="726.76" dur="4.95">to convince us of why the economy is</text>
  <text start="729.67" dur="4.38">strong because what is happening in the</text>
  <text start="731.71" dur="5.91">background right now is that the economy</text>
  <text start="734.05" dur="6.72">is ripping itself apart and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="737.62" dur="5.34">to get worse a lot worse as we move</text>
  <text start="740.77" dur="5.04">throughout this spring into summer and</text>
  <text start="742.96" dur="5.61">then into fall and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="745.81" dur="5.4">build this narrative right now of how</text>
  <text start="748.57" dur="5.24">great things are it&amp;#39;s almost like when</text>
  <text start="751.21" dur="7.05">Bernanke came out prior to the crash in</text>
  <text start="753.81" dur="6.01">2008 while he was in 2008 speaking in</text>
  <text start="758.26" dur="3.33">this interview about how great the</text>
  <text start="759.82" dur="3.87">economy was doing and how strong it was</text>
  <text start="761.59" dur="3.72">and how it&amp;#39;s impossible for anything of</text>
  <text start="763.69" dur="4.59">these things to happen where the housing</text>
  <text start="765.31" dur="5.67">prices come down or anything else we can</text>
  <text start="768.28" dur="6.78">see they&amp;#39;re doing the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="770.98" dur="7.11">the question is why they&amp;#39;re doing it</text>
  <text start="775.06" dur="6.24">because they need to set up the</text>
  <text start="778.09" dur="6.3">narrative for the collapse they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="781.3" dur="4.89">to begin well they they have started but</text>
  <text start="784.39" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re going to continue on throughout</text>
  <text start="786.19" dur="4.8">the spring and summer where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="788.17" dur="7.47">going to convince everyone that the</text>
  <text start="790.99" dur="6.81">economy is very strong and as the</text>
  <text start="795.64" dur="4.26">economy deteriorates they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="797.8" dur="4.38">try to push the stock market up they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="799.9" dur="3.9">going to explain away why all these are</text>
  <text start="802.18" dur="3">things are happening they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="803.8" dur="4.5">say please don&amp;#39;t believe these numbers</text>
  <text start="805.18" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s an aberration it&amp;#39;s transitory it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="808.3" dur="4.8">just going to get a lot better as we get</text>
  <text start="810.37" dur="4.38">to the latter part of this year and this</text>
  <text start="813.1" dur="3.96">is all part of their plan to convince</text>
  <text start="814.75" dur="3.84">everyone and the corporate media that</text>
  <text start="817.06" dur="3.57">believing is going to spew this all out</text>
  <text start="818.59" dur="3.24">there whatever the Fed saying they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="820.63" dur="3.63">going to be out there saying the same</text>
  <text start="821.83" dur="4.44">exact thing where they&amp;#39;re trying to tell</text>
  <text start="824.26" dur="4.98">you that everything is fine until the</text>
  <text start="826.27" dur="8.07">last moment when the system comes down</text>
  <text start="829.24" dur="9.6">and they will have in place o neither an</text>
  <text start="834.34" dur="7.71">individual a country or a group to blame</text>
  <text start="838.84" dur="7.08">why the economy fell apart all of a</text>
  <text start="842.05" dur="6.96">sudden and when this system does fall</text>
  <text start="845.92" dur="5.61">apart just like we saw at home capital</text>
  <text start="849.01" dur="4.14">goods they&amp;#39;re going to quickly react</text>
  <text start="851.53" dur="3.15">they&amp;#39;re not going to wait and say okay</text>
  <text start="853.15" dur="3.48">see how many people take their money out</text>
  <text start="854.68" dur="4.2">of the bank know what they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="856.63" dur="4.14">do is they&amp;#39;re going to say okay bank</text>
  <text start="858.88" dur="3.78">holiday actually most likely they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="860.77" dur="3.35">probably do this on a Friday because</text>
  <text start="862.66" dur="4.71">this way it will catch people off-guard</text>
  <text start="864.12" dur="5.56">where they say okay all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="867.37" dur="3.93">things started to happen we need a bank</text>
  <text start="869.68" dur="3.57">holiday but don&amp;#39;t worry it will only be</text>
  <text start="871.3" dur="3.84">through the weekend and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="873.25" dur="3.96">put capital controls where we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="875.14" dur="4.08">to shut it down right now and maybe when</text>
  <text start="877.21" dur="3.6">we open on Monday things might be fine</text>
  <text start="879.22" dur="3.96">or we might have one or two days of</text>
  <text start="880.81" dur="4.469">capital controls and we know that this</text>
  <text start="883.18" dur="4.74">is not going to last to one or two days</text>
  <text start="885.279" dur="4.591">when you hear that</text>
  <text start="887.92" dur="4.05">okay we need to close the banks because</text>
  <text start="889.87" dur="4.8">something some type of an event happened</text>
  <text start="891.97" dur="4.89">you are too late you will not be able to</text>
  <text start="894.67" dur="5.52">get your funds out of the bank they are</text>
  <text start="896.86" dur="6.9">stuck in there and according from many</text>
  <text start="900.19" dur="5.399">sources and individuals the electronic</text>
  <text start="903.76" dur="3.99">currency is just going to disappear</text>
  <text start="905.589" dur="4.711">actually it actually did disappear when</text>
  <text start="907.75" dur="4.65">you look at the people in Cyprus those</text>
  <text start="910.3" dur="4.86">accounts they were replaced with</text>
  <text start="912.4" dur="4.5">worthless Bank stock so their funds</text>
  <text start="915.16" dur="3.54">actually really did disappear because</text>
  <text start="916.9" dur="4.17">what do you do with Bank stock you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="918.7" dur="4.98">do anything with it and the same things</text>
  <text start="921.07" dur="4.95">going to happen where the electronic</text>
  <text start="923.68" dur="3.96">currency just going to disappear and yes</text>
  <text start="926.02" dur="4.02">people are going to be very very angry</text>
  <text start="927.64" dur="6.29">and this is why I do believe they have</text>
  <text start="930.04" dur="7.65">something planned to shift everyone to</text>
  <text start="933.93" dur="5.74">point the finger at someone else maybe</text>
  <text start="937.69" dur="3.96">it will be a trump maybe it will be at</text>
  <text start="939.67" dur="6.12">North Korea maybe they&amp;#39;ll point the</text>
  <text start="941.65" dur="6.54">finger at Iran Syria China and they will</text>
  <text start="945.79" dur="4.86">blame these other groups or person and</text>
  <text start="948.19" dur="4.2">say we were not responsible for this</text>
  <text start="950.65" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;ve been telling you all along how</text>
  <text start="952.39" dur="6.24">great the economy has been and we can</text>
  <text start="955.99" dur="5.43">see from their actions or Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="958.63" dur="6.26">actions or from China or from maybe even</text>
  <text start="961.42" dur="7.02">Russia North Korea they&amp;#39;re the ones who</text>
  <text start="964.89" dur="4.9">turn the economy upside down and now</text>
  <text start="968.44" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;re going to do everything we possibly</text>
  <text start="969.79" dur="6.03">can to help out which means lowering the</text>
  <text start="973.24" dur="5.01">interest rates which means creating more</text>
  <text start="975.82" dur="4.98">stimulus which means we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="978.25" dur="4.65">a huge amount of inflation which means</text>
  <text start="980.8" dur="4.59">that people are not going to believe</text>
  <text start="982.9" dur="3.599">this anymore because what are they going</text>
  <text start="985.39" dur="2.369">to do just create</text>
  <text start="986.499" dur="4.02">more and more currency and give it to</text>
  <text start="987.759" dur="7.17">the banks but at this point what does</text>
  <text start="990.519" dur="5.94">that do it inflates the bubbles and once</text>
  <text start="994.929" dur="3.54">the bubbles come down they will inflate</text>
  <text start="996.459" dur="5.01">it as much as they possibly can and then</text>
  <text start="998.469" dur="4.53">the bubbles will pop again so I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="1001.469" dur="3.21">this from the beginning for a long time</text>
  <text start="1002.999" dur="3.9">ago where I believe this is going to</text>
  <text start="1004.679" dur="4.17">happen in two phases where we&amp;#39;ll get the</text>
  <text start="1006.899" dur="4.2">initial collapse which will allow the</text>
  <text start="1008.849" dur="6.03">central bank to lower the rates which</text>
  <text start="1011.099" dur="6.78">will allow the central bank to start</text>
  <text start="1014.879" dur="4.92">creating currency like crazy they&amp;#39;ll try</text>
  <text start="1017.879" dur="5.52">to inflate as much as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="1019.799" dur="6.75">and we will hit will be hit with another</text>
  <text start="1023.399" dur="5.19">event of some type what that is we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1026.549" dur="4.59">know yet but then the economy will come</text>
  <text start="1028.589" dur="5.31">down once again and this time it will be</text>
  <text start="1031.139" dur="4.68">pretty much done and they will have the</text>
  <text start="1033.899" dur="4.201">proof and they&amp;#39;ll have all the</text>
  <text start="1035.819" dur="6.33">information of who did it why they did</text>
  <text start="1038.1" dur="6.179">it and we need to go after them so if</text>
  <text start="1042.149" dur="6.24">you haven&amp;#39;t prepared and you&amp;#39;re not</text>
