  <text start="35.61" dur="5.88">episode 837 be and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="38.67" dur="4.92">December 8th 2015 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="41.49" dur="4.08">episode is the US government central</text>
  <text start="43.59" dur="5.55">bankers are preparing for another false</text>
  <text start="45.57" dur="6.09">flag event let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="49.14" dur="5.91">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="51.66" dur="6.75">now we realize Obama has stated many</text>
  <text start="55.05" dur="6.12">many times that his mission is to remove</text>
  <text start="58.41" dur="6.69">the weapons of the people and he will go</text>
  <text start="61.17" dur="6.12">and do whatever he needs to do to get</text>
  <text start="65.1" dur="4.89">the guns away from the people which</text>
  <text start="67.29" dur="5.1">means more false flags which means more</text>
  <text start="69.99" dur="4.98">mass shootings which means he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="72.39" dur="6.93">ramp them up because he has what is it</text>
  <text start="74.97" dur="6.54">nine months left to do this so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="79.32" dur="5.19">going to see many many more false flag</text>
  <text start="81.51" dur="6.87">events occur and not just for gun</text>
  <text start="84.51" dur="5.19">control to bring us into war but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="88.38" dur="5.25">very interesting is that the New York</text>
  <text start="89.7" dur="6.3">Times the editorial board took their</text>
  <text start="93.63" dur="5.7">plea for gun bans to the front page on</text>
  <text start="96" dur="6.03">Saturday calling our nation&amp;#39;s in action</text>
  <text start="99.33" dur="6.45">on gun control a moral outrage and a</text>
  <text start="102.03" dur="7.64">national disgrace and they are telling</text>
  <text start="105.78" dur="7.74">the American people to give up their</text>
  <text start="109.67" dur="8.68">weapons for their for the good of their</text>
  <text start="113.52" dur="9.66">fellow citizens well I&amp;#39;m sorry we have a</text>
  <text start="118.35" dur="8.99">right to own and carry weapons the</text>
  <text start="123.18" dur="8.699">Second Amendment allows us to do this if</text>
  <text start="127.34" dur="6.19">the government would like to remove the</text>
  <text start="131.879" dur="3.901">rights that we have of course these</text>
  <text start="133.53" dur="5.88">rights that we are born with so can they</text>
  <text start="135.78" dur="6.959">really be removed no but to remove an</text>
  <text start="139.41" dur="6.6">amendment they just can&amp;#39;t create a law</text>
  <text start="142.739" dur="7.021">they can&amp;#39;t just beg people to do it the</text>
  <text start="146.01" dur="8.61">people have to decide and come together</text>
  <text start="149.76" dur="6.059">and say okay let&amp;#39;s change this and what</text>
  <text start="154.62" dur="3.869">they need to do is they have to have a</text>
  <text start="155.819" dur="6.031">majority of the states do this but when</text>
  <text start="158.489" dur="5.371">you look at the poll which is done by</text>
  <text start="161.85" dur="2.58">Gallup which is a people&amp;#39;s poll and</text>
  <text start="163.86" dur="2.849">we&amp;#39;re not looking</text>
  <text start="164.43" dur="4.169">the government polls because when you</text>
  <text start="166.709" dur="4.25">look at the governmental polls those</text>
  <text start="168.599" dur="7.2">pollsters are paid the corporate media</text>
  <text start="170.959" dur="6.971">polls are paid for by the government but</text>
  <text start="175.799" dur="5.821">when you look at gallop they asked a</text>
  <text start="177.93" dur="5.369">question and this basically is the</text>
  <text start="181.62" dur="4.89">support for ban on possession of</text>
  <text start="183.299" dur="6.181">handguns from 1959 to 2015 and the</text>
  <text start="186.51" dur="5.25">question is as follows do you think</text>
  <text start="189.48" dur="4.56">there should or should not be a law that</text>
  <text start="191.76" dur="4.71">would ban the possession of handguns</text>
  <text start="194.04" dur="8.94">except by the police and other</text>
  <text start="196.47" dur="9.389">authorized persons now there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="202.98" dur="7.459">answers that the guns should be banned</text>
  <text start="205.859" dur="8.88">and should not be banned well in 2015</text>
  <text start="210.439" dur="6.61">seventy-two percent said no we should</text>
  <text start="214.739" dur="5.821">not ban handguns everyone has the right</text>
  <text start="217.049" dur="6.151">to have them twenty-seven percent said</text>
  <text start="220.56" dur="6.48">yes it should be banned so right now the</text>
  <text start="223.2" dur="5.73">people are saying that people have the</text>
  <text start="227.04" dur="5.819">right to have weapons and actually was</text>
  <text start="228.93" dur="10.679">very interesting from the year nineteen</text>
  <text start="232.859" dur="11.041">eighty this percentage has gone up back</text>
  <text start="239.609" dur="8.071">in nineteen eighty it was around 51% 89</text>
  <text start="243.9" dur="7.86">it was at fifty nine percent 98 it was</text>
  <text start="247.68" dur="5.85">at sixty-two percent 2010 was at 71</text>
  <text start="251.76" dur="3.869">percent and now we&amp;#39;re up to seventy-two</text>
  <text start="253.53" dur="4.25">percent so whatever the government is</text>
  <text start="255.629" dur="5.341">doing under having the opposite effect</text>
  <text start="257.78" dur="5.949">actually every time they have this false</text>
  <text start="260.97" dur="6.81">flag event they show a mass shooter more</text>
  <text start="263.729" dur="5.551">people purchase weapons because that</text>
  <text start="267.78" dur="3.18">makes sense to people wait a minute</text>
  <text start="269.28" dur="3.72">there&amp;#39;s people running around with</text>
  <text start="270.96" dur="4.59">weapons then I need a weapon to protect</text>
  <text start="273" dur="3.93">myself everyone should have a weapon to</text>
  <text start="275.55" dur="3.75">protect themselves and if they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="276.93" dur="6.03">this story that there are terrorists</text>
  <text start="279.3" dur="5.13">running around in this country why</text>
  <text start="282.96" dur="4.019">wouldn&amp;#39;t you want to protect yourself</text>
  <text start="284.43" dur="8.91">from the terrace why would you hand your</text>
  <text start="286.979" dur="8.731">gun in it makes no sense this is when we</text>
  <text start="293.34" dur="4.59">need to bring common sense into the</text>
  <text start="295.71" dur="5.269">formula</text>
  <text start="297.93" dur="6.39">government common sense makes no sense</text>
  <text start="300.979" dur="6.28">the everyday person&amp;#39;s common sense makes</text>
  <text start="304.32" dur="5.61">perfect sense wait shooters terrorists</text>
  <text start="307.259" dur="4.921">and if you believe their official story</text>
  <text start="309.93" dur="4.26">I need a weapon I need to protect my</text>
  <text start="312.18" dur="4.23">family I&amp;#39;m not getting caught up in this</text>
  <text start="314.19" dur="3.84">where I have a pair of scissors and I</text>
  <text start="316.41" dur="5.31">have to go around stabbing someone that</text>
  <text start="318.03" dur="5.43">has a weapon that makes no sense but of</text>
  <text start="321.72" dur="5.789">course the government wants you to think</text>
  <text start="323.46" dur="5.459">the other way there&amp;#39;s mass shootings we</text>
  <text start="327.509" dur="4.19">need to get rid of the weapons to make</text>
  <text start="328.919" dur="7.051">everyone safe but we know for a fact</text>
  <text start="331.699" dur="7.211">criminals always find a way to get</text>
  <text start="335.97" dur="6.84">things illegally well let me say drugs</text>
  <text start="338.91" dur="6.41">are illegal cocaine heroin we don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="342.81" dur="6.06">any of that on the streets oh wait we do</text>
  <text start="345.32" dur="7.9">during the Prohibition times alcohol was</text>
  <text start="348.87" dur="6.389">illegal did we see that oh wait yes they</text>
  <text start="353.22" dur="4.62">smuggle that in the black market well</text>
  <text start="355.259" dur="4.021">the law abiding citizens it was hard for</text>
  <text start="357.84" dur="5.13">them to get it except if they went to</text>
  <text start="359.28" dur="5.97">the black market so all of this talk is</text>
  <text start="362.97" dur="4.35">not going to stop those people that</text>
  <text start="365.25" dur="4.5">really want to get it and once those</text>
  <text start="367.32" dur="5.27">people have the weapons and the law</text>
  <text start="369.75" dur="7.229">abiding citizen doesn&amp;#39;t have the weapons</text>
  <text start="372.59" dur="13.27">they&amp;#39;re open to more crime more killing</text>
  <text start="376.979" dur="12.451">and everything else now there are four</text>
  <text start="385.86" dur="6">former Air Force drone operators that</text>
  <text start="389.43" dur="5.22">turn whistleblowers and they went public</text>
  <text start="391.86" dur="4.89">this week to let everyone know about</text>
  <text start="394.65" dur="4.199">what has been going on with drones that</text>
  <text start="396.75" dur="4.159">they&amp;#39;ve been killing innocent people and</text>
  <text start="398.849" dur="4.741">they were sick and tired of this and</text>
  <text start="400.909" dur="5.741">this was done through a documentary</text>
  <text start="403.59" dur="5.759">called drone and when they went public</text>
  <text start="406.65" dur="6.47">this week their credit cards and bank</text>
  <text start="409.349" dur="6.181">accounts were frozen by the government</text>
  <text start="413.12" dur="4.9">this was done despite the fact they done</text>
  <text start="415.53" dur="4.83">nothing wrong and they haven&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="418.02" dur="5.45">charged with anything everything was</text>
  <text start="420.36" dur="6.39">just frozen Michael Hoss Brandon Bryant</text>
  <text start="423.47" dur="5.4">see on Westmore Westmoreland and Stephen</text>
  <text start="426.75" dur="2.12">Lewis</text>
  <text start="429.23" dur="5.76">and they served as drone operators in</text>
  <text start="432.41" dur="4.35">the US Air Force and they were giving</text>
  <text start="434.99" dur="4.05">detailed accounts of the widespread</text>
  <text start="436.76" dur="5">corruption and institutionalized</text>
  <text start="439.04" dur="5.34">indifference to civilian casualties that</text>
  <text start="441.76" dur="4.06">characterized the program some of those</text>
  <text start="444.38" dur="4.31">disclosures were made in the recent</text>
  <text start="445.82" dur="5.46">documentary like I said in drone and</text>
  <text start="448.69" dur="5.38">they came to the realization that they</text>
  <text start="451.28" dur="5.13">were just killing innocent people and as</text>
  <text start="454.07" dur="6.24">they did this people were getting angry</text>
  <text start="456.41" dur="8.99">and they were getting the feeling of</text>
  <text start="460.31" dur="7.71">hatred from the surrounding people and</text>
  <text start="465.4" dur="6.06">this is why the countries and the people</text>
  <text start="468.02" dur="6.3">of these countries don&amp;#39;t like the u.s.</text>
  <text start="471.46" dur="7.21">well not the people specifically but the</text>
  <text start="474.32" dur="6.33">government of the United States and the</text>
  <text start="478.67" dur="5.31">administration and its predators they</text>
  <text start="480.65" dur="5.97">built this drone program and it is one</text>
  <text start="483.98" dur="6.39">of the most devastating driving forces</text>
  <text start="486.62" dur="6.03">for the destabilization around the world</text>
  <text start="490.37" dur="7.44">where people in these countries are</text>
  <text start="492.65" dur="8.13">rising up pushing the u.s. out of their</text>
  <text start="497.81" dur="5.07">countries and every time the u.s. comes</text>
  <text start="500.78" dur="3.03">in and uses drones on the civilians</text>
  <text start="502.88" dur="4.89">because you have to remember how this</text>
  <text start="503.81" dur="7.17">works al-qaeda in each one of these</text>
  <text start="507.77" dur="6.5">countries refers to the people of the</text>
  <text start="510.98" dur="9.29">country because this is how it&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="514.27" dur="10.24">al-qaeda is the terrorist group when</text>
  <text start="520.27" dur="7.53">they need to get into a country we have</text>
  <text start="524.51" dur="6.51">to remove al-qaeda we have to get them</text>
  <text start="527.8" dur="6.28">once the puppet government is in and</text>
  <text start="531.02" dur="5.91">installed in that country the people who</text>
  <text start="534.08" dur="4.92">do not agree with the new us papa</text>
  <text start="536.93" dur="5.45">government they are called al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="539" dur="7.05">because of the authorization for war</text>
  <text start="542.38" dur="6.45">going back during the Iraqi war that</text>
  <text start="546.05" dur="5.82">authorization allows them to go after</text>
  <text start="548.83" dur="6.22">terrorism especially al Qaeda and their</text>
  <text start="551.87" dur="4.95">authorized to use drones on these people</text>
  <text start="555.05" dur="5.13">and most of these people are just</text>
  <text start="556.82" dur="6.269">civilians for example in Ukraine when we</text>
  <text start="560.18" dur="5.37">had the coup d&amp;#39;etat the US government</text>
  <text start="563.089" dur="5.79">85 billion dollars to switch out the</text>
  <text start="565.55" dur="5.67">government all those people did that</text>
  <text start="568.879" dur="4.471">that did not agree with the new puppet</text>
  <text start="571.22" dur="4.71">government they were labeled as</text>
  <text start="573.35" dur="6.419">terrorists one day they were everyday</text>
  <text start="575.93" dur="5.55">citizens of Ukraine and now those people</text>
  <text start="579.769" dur="3.57">who wanted to fight back against this</text>
  <text start="581.48" dur="4.32">regime change they were labeled</text>
  <text start="583.339" dur="5.19">terrorists and this is what we see all</text>
  <text start="585.8" dur="5.909">across the Middle East Ukraine and many</text>
  <text start="588.529" dur="6.211">other countries now the US has been</text>
  <text start="591.709" dur="4.32">provoking Russia and China I mean</text>
  <text start="594.74" dur="5.819">they&amp;#39;ve been provoking Russia and</text>
  <text start="596.029" dur="7.081">Ukraine and Syria they want a war they</text>
  <text start="600.559" dur="4.77">provoking China in the Pacific around</text>
  <text start="603.11" dur="4.8">the Spratly Islands selling the warships</text>
  <text start="605.329" dur="4.591">around there flying planes over the</text>
  <text start="607.91" dur="4.5">Spratly Islands and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="609.92" dur="4.2">continually do this until they hit a</text>
  <text start="612.41" dur="3.779">nerve where one of these countries</text>
  <text start="614.12" dur="4.92">actually does something and if they</text>
  <text start="616.189" dur="4.171">don&amp;#39;t do something it will be a false</text>
  <text start="619.04" dur="4.469">flag where the United States will turn</text>
  <text start="620.36" dur="5.089">around and say they actually did it but</text>
  <text start="623.509" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re taking this to the next step</text>
  <text start="625.449" dur="4.81">singapore right now has permitted a US</text>
  <text start="628.399" dur="4.38">spy aircraft to conduct surveillance</text>
  <text start="630.259" dur="5.281">operations from its territory to support</text>
  <text start="632.779" dur="5.37">maritime security efforts while keeping</text>
  <text start="635.54" dur="6.479">a close watch on Beijing&amp;#39;s activities in</text>
  <text start="638.149" dur="6.99">the South China Sea under the agreement</text>
  <text start="642.019" dur="5.851">reached by Washington and Singapore the</text>
  <text start="645.139" dur="4.26">American p8 Poseidon military aircraft</text>
  <text start="647.87" dur="5.49">will be deployed to Singapore later this</text>
  <text start="649.399" dur="6.81">month to fly in this region and all of</text>
  <text start="653.36" dur="6.18">this is being done to continually</text>
  <text start="656.209" dur="6.211">provoke China and they&amp;#39;re going to ramp</text>
  <text start="659.54" dur="6.83">this up as time goes on because they</text>
  <text start="662.42" dur="8.37">need this work they&amp;#39;re desperate for it</text>
  <text start="666.37" dur="7.809">now the IMF needs to keep Ukraine funded</text>
  <text start="670.79" dur="5.729">and right now Ukraine doesn&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="674.179" dur="4.08">funds to pay back the three billion</text>
  <text start="676.519" dur="6">dollars worth of bonds that they owe</text>
  <text start="678.259" dur="7.05">Russia and under the IMF laws and their</text>
  <text start="682.519" dur="4.651">lending rules i should say they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="685.309" dur="4.801">lend to a country that will be in</text>
  <text start="687.17" dur="5.58">default so but that what they&amp;#39;ll do is</text>
  <text start="690.11" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;ll just change their rules and now</text>
  <text start="692.75" dur="3.689">they can lend to a country that is in</text>
  <text start="694.73" dur="2.169">default so basically what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="696.439" dur="3.281">telling</text>
  <text start="696.899" dur="6.48">us is that Ukraine is going to default</text>
  <text start="699.72" dur="6.029">on the three billion and the IMF will</text>
  <text start="703.379" dur="5.791">keep them funded and keep them in debt</text>
  <text start="705.749" dur="4.861">of course now that I guess they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="709.17" dur="3.779">to have to do this to every country and</text>
  <text start="710.61" dur="5.969">put more and more countries into debt so</text>
  <text start="712.949" dur="7.11">all bets are off they need to keep the</text>
  <text start="716.579" dur="5.581">IMF every Ukraine funded because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="720.059" dur="6.51">getting ready for a major offensive and</text>
  <text start="722.16" dur="7.919">this is why they cannot stop funding the</text>
  <text start="726.569" dur="8.81">Kiev government Biden is still out there</text>
  <text start="730.079" dur="8.1">and one of his other statements is that</text>
  <text start="735.379" dur="5.26">he has assured Ukraine lawmakers that</text>
  <text start="738.179" dur="5.27">the US will only step up pressure on</text>
  <text start="740.639" dur="5.581">Moscow if Russian aggression continues</text>
  <text start="743.449" dur="4.841">well there is no Russian aggression the</text>
  <text start="746.22" dur="6.69">aggression is coming from Kiev from the</text>
  <text start="748.29" dur="9.169">United States Crimea right now after</text>

  <text start="1155.67" dur="8.64">nine missiles that were used when they</text>
