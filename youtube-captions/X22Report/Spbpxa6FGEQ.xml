  <text start="222.23" dur="5.429">prepared and ready the whole thing just</text>
  <text start="224.359" dur="4.19">fell apart and now they&amp;#39;re left with</text>
  <text start="227.659" dur="4.11">nothing</text>
  <text start="228.549" dur="5.231">what is Nadler doing now he issued a</text>
  <text start="231.769" dur="5.101">subpoena to the Department of Homeland</text>
  <text start="233.78" dur="5.4">Security for documents over a joke Trump</text>
  <text start="236.87" dur="4.29">made about pardoning DHS officials and</text>
  <text start="239.18" dur="4.44">of course this is not true whatsoever</text>
  <text start="241.16" dur="5.52">Trump is saying I never said anything</text>
  <text start="243.62" dur="7.17">like this but he&amp;#39;s looking for document</text>
  <text start="246.68" dur="7.949">and documentation on this to help his</text>
  <text start="250.79" dur="6.96">impeachment investigation he&amp;#39;s looking</text>
  <text start="254.629" dur="6.871">for anything and everything and guess</text>
  <text start="257.75" dur="5.76">what there&amp;#39;s nothing why because when</text>
  <text start="261.5" dur="6.51">Trump came into this position and he was</text>
  <text start="263.51" dur="7.86">asked by the military to be the guy in</text>
  <text start="268.01" dur="6.33">the front they went through everything</text>
  <text start="271.37" dur="5.64">they made sure there was nothing there</text>
  <text start="274.34" dur="5.4">nothing the deep stake could get their</text>
  <text start="277.01" dur="4.98">hands on and I said before the reason</text>
  <text start="279.74" dur="4.89">why is keeping back the tax returns is</text>
  <text start="281.99" dur="6.06">because there is no law and he&amp;#39;s showing</text>
  <text start="284.63" dur="6.69">them I don&amp;#39;t have to do what you tell me</text>
  <text start="288.05" dur="6.63">to do there&amp;#39;s no law here and just</text>
  <text start="291.32" dur="4.92">because all of you have done it we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="294.68" dur="4.32">heading in a different direction</text>
  <text start="296.24" dur="4.38">and we know eventually once the tax</text>
  <text start="299" dur="3.53">returns comes out and maybe he&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="300.62" dur="5.16">produce them there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="302.53" dur="4.509">absolutely nothing there why because</text>

  <text start="941.35" dur="5.6">something it pisses judges off now when</text>
  <text start="945.49" dur="4.26">we look at the Jeffrey Epstein case</text>
  <text start="946.95" dur="4.98">things are starting to heat up now and</text>
  <text start="949.75" dur="4.44">there&amp;#39;s a lot more people that are</text>
  <text start="951.93" dur="4.33">associated with Jeffrey Epstein and we</text>
  <text start="954.19" dur="4.32">know that there was a mystery man who</text>

  <text start="958.51" dur="4.21">you&amp;#39;re gonna ruin people&amp;#39;s reputations</text>
  <text start="960.64" dur="3.97">and we can</text>
  <text start="962.72" dur="6.63">that Jeffrey Epstein was connected to</text>
  <text start="964.61" dur="8.63">very high-profile individuals political</text>
  <text start="969.35" dur="7.95">Hollywood royalty and the latest is</text>
  <text start="973.24" dur="7.449">Dubin and we can see that with</text>
  <text start="977.3" dur="6.149">everything that&amp;#39;s going on this is just</text>
  <text start="980.689" dur="4.59">the beginning just because Epstein&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="987.589" dur="5.43">not pursuing all these under individuals</text>

  <text start="1015.16" dur="6.9">feel the pain but like we said before</text>
  <text start="1017.819" dur="8.531">this is all being done at the same time</text>
  <text start="1022.06" dur="11.099">that the Patriots are releasing the</text>
