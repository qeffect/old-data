  <text start="59.44" dur="4.77">is doing well because this is what the</text>
  <text start="62.11" dur="3.93">US government central bankers are you</text>
  <text start="64.21" dur="5.04">are using the stock market for they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="66.04" dur="5.52">trying to convince the entire public in</text>
  <text start="69.25" dur="5.01">the world that the economy is doing well</text>
  <text start="71.56" dur="5.43">now if you take what we just saw in the</text>
  <text start="74.26" dur="6.3">stock market and you take the four point</text>
  <text start="76.99" dur="7.23">seven percent unemployment everyone will</text>
  <text start="80.56" dur="7.44">believe that everything is fine now in</text>
  <text start="84.22" dur="7.469">the background well we are seeing a</text>
  <text start="88" dur="6.509">completely different story and in the</text>
  <text start="91.689" dur="7.621">background leading up to the 2008 crash</text>
  <text start="94.509" dur="7.831">we are seeing the same type of story but</text>
  <text start="99.31" dur="4.769">no one likes to talk about it the US</text>
  <text start="102.34" dur="3.75">government the corporate media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="104.079" dur="3.15">not going to be talking about it because</text>
  <text start="106.09" dur="4.919">they want you to believe that everything</text>
  <text start="107.229" dur="7.441">is fine now today we saw a consumer</text>
  <text start="111.009" dur="7.5">credit it didn&amp;#39;t do as well as it did in</text>
  <text start="114.67" dur="6.659">March and it only increased by thirteen</text>
  <text start="118.509" dur="5.551">point four billion well below the 18</text>
  <text start="121.329" dur="4.74">billion that was expected and the</text>
  <text start="124.06" dur="4.949">biggest culprit in this entire thing was</text>
  <text start="126.069" dur="5.761">the revolving credit and we can see</text>
  <text start="129.009" dur="6.391">there&amp;#39;s been a lot of people being laid</text>
  <text start="131.83" dur="5.61">off a lot of people that are in jobs are</text>
  <text start="135.4" dur="4.559">very nervous because they see their</text>
  <text start="137.44" dur="4.11">colleagues being laid off and many</text>
  <text start="139.959" dur="3.631">people most likely are not out there</text>
  <text start="141.55" dur="4.38">going to spend money and those people</text>
  <text start="143.59" dur="4.53">that are being laid off they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="145.93" dur="4.71">trying to spend any money at this point</text>
  <text start="148.12" dur="5.97">either and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="150.64" dur="5.31">is slow down and remember when we talked</text>
  <text start="154.09" dur="4.86">about revolving credit it&amp;#39;s really not</text>
  <text start="155.95" dur="6.06">the people&amp;#39;s money this is all borrowed</text>
  <text start="158.95" dur="5.369">money and it&amp;#39;s amazing how they use this</text>
  <text start="162.01" dur="6.089">to gauge how the economy</text>
  <text start="164.319" dur="6.06">is doing because anybody can get a</text>
  <text start="168.099" dur="5.01">credit card actually today all you need</text>
  <text start="170.379" dur="5.131">is a heartbeat and you can borrow money</text>
  <text start="173.109" dur="5.88">to buy things the problem is that people</text>
  <text start="175.51" dur="5.759">don&amp;#39;t have money to pay these cards off</text>
  <text start="178.989" dur="5.67">they just keep charging and living off</text>
  <text start="181.269" dur="5.64">of them take away the cards it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="184.659" dur="6.181">completely different story if we had a</text>
  <text start="186.909" dur="8.19">strong economy we wouldn&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="190.84" dur="8.459">borrow money to pay for food to live and</text>
  <text start="195.099" dur="8.191">pay for our everyday expenses a strong</text>
  <text start="199.299" dur="7.17">vibrant economy all you would need is</text>
  <text start="203.29" dur="5.809">the money that you earned but today we</text>
  <text start="206.469" dur="7.17">live in a completely different world and</text>
  <text start="209.099" dur="6.491">we see right now as we move forward it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="213.639" dur="4.32">just going to get worse and worse now</text>
  <text start="215.59" dur="4.47">everyone thought well you know if we</text>
  <text start="217.959" dur="4.89">could only increase minimum wage this</text>
  <text start="220.06" dur="5.849">would solve all our problems because</text>
  <text start="222.849" dur="5.521">that is the problem people are just not</text>
  <text start="225.909" dur="5.01">making enough money and of course what</text>
  <text start="228.37" dur="4.53">they did is they won from 8,000 25 cents</text>
  <text start="230.919" dur="4.1">they increase it to 1150 and then they</text>
  <text start="232.9" dur="5.489">brought it up to fifteen dollars an hour</text>
  <text start="235.019" dur="10">now we know what companies do when this</text>
  <text start="238.389" dur="10.8">occurs well they lay off people they go</text>
  <text start="245.019" dur="6.47">ahead and they remove the living person</text>
  <text start="249.189" dur="6.931">from the job and then replace it with an</text>
  <text start="251.489" dur="7.72">electronic kiosk type of system that can</text>
  <text start="256.12" dur="7.829">do the same job and all of these minimum</text>
  <text start="259.209" dur="7.561">wage people are out of work and this is</text>
  <text start="263.949" dur="4.621">starting to come true according to</text>
  <text start="266.77" dur="5.369">report from the employment policy</text>
  <text start="268.57" dur="5.64">institute nearly half of Washington DC</text>
  <text start="272.139" dur="3.9">employer said they have either laid off</text>
  <text start="274.21" dur="5.489">employees or reduce the hours of</text>
  <text start="276.039" dur="7.44">employees to adapt to the new wage hikes</text>
  <text start="279.699" dur="5.97">since 2014 the District of Columbia has</text>
  <text start="283.479" dur="6.12">been I&amp;#39;ve seen the minimum wage go from</text>
  <text start="285.669" dur="7.951">my gate 25 in 2014 to 1150 all the way</text>
  <text start="289.599" dur="5.581">up to $15 and to offset this they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="293.62" dur="4.56">been laying off people reducing the</text>
  <text start="295.18" dur="8.01">hours and going electronic</text>
  <text start="298.18" dur="8.37">now our problem is not that people</text>
  <text start="303.19" dur="7.11">aren&amp;#39;t making enough money well that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="306.55" dur="6.51">little piece of it and yes everyone</text>
  <text start="310.3" dur="5.61">would love to make more money the</text>
  <text start="313.06" dur="6.15">problem is the central bank the problem</text>
  <text start="315.91" dur="5.36">is the devaluation of the dollar which</text>
  <text start="319.21" dur="6.39">makes things a lot more expensive and</text>
  <text start="321.27" dur="6.369">we&amp;#39;re continually seeing this and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.6" dur="6.72">going to continue on as we move forward</text>
  <text start="327.639" dur="7.741">so doing this band-aid fix of raising</text>
  <text start="332.32" dur="5.25">the minimum wage it&amp;#39;s not going to do</text>
  <text start="335.38" dur="4.55">anything maybe in the short run people</text>
  <text start="337.57" dur="5.61">will feel happy I&amp;#39;m making more money</text>
  <text start="339.93" dur="5.549">but in the long run it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="343.18" dur="5.25">solve anything and we can see already</text>
  <text start="345.479" dur="7.181">it&amp;#39;s not really helping it&amp;#39;s like at</text>
  <text start="348.43" dur="6.93">work if you get your raise does it</text>
  <text start="352.66" dur="6.03">really help you or does it just keep you</text>
  <text start="355.36" dur="7.35">level on the playing field and when that</text>
  <text start="358.69" dur="5.699">Ray stops guess what happens things are</text>
  <text start="362.71" dur="4.709">getting more expensive or i should say</text>
  <text start="364.389" dur="5.52">the dollar is being devalued it makes it</text>
  <text start="367.419" dur="7.081">harder for you so we need to go to the</text>
  <text start="369.909" dur="7.831">source to the disease and that is the</text>
  <text start="374.5" dur="7.5">central bank that&amp;#39;s the thing we need to</text>
  <text start="377.74" dur="9.2">get rid of we need to get rid of a bank</text>
  <text start="382" dur="11.669">that creates money out of thin air and</text>
  <text start="386.94" dur="8.979">then attaches interest to it and gives</text>
  <text start="393.669" dur="6.18">it to the government and the government</text>
  <text start="395.919" dur="6.961">prints up a bond that it gives to the</text>
  <text start="399.849" dur="5.431">Federal Reserve and now the government</text>
  <text start="402.88" dur="6.99">owes interest on the money they just</text>
  <text start="405.28" dur="6.21">borrowed and of course they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="409.87" dur="6.03">the funds to pay the interest so they</text>
  <text start="411.49" dur="7.62">have to borrow more and this situation</text>
  <text start="415.9" dur="5.97">is a no-win situation now in the</text>
  <text start="419.11" dur="8.76">corporate media they&amp;#39;re pushing the idea</text>
  <text start="421.87" dur="9.72">that hiring is tumbling even know the</text>
  <text start="427.87" dur="4.139">job openings are record highs now the</text>
  <text start="431.59" dur="2.549">big</text>
  <text start="432.009" dur="3.9">this number of job openings were in the</text>
  <text start="434.139" dur="4.471">leisure and hospitality services</text>
  <text start="435.909" dur="5.22">industries followed by accommodation and</text>
  <text start="438.61" dur="4.38">food services retail trade education and</text>
  <text start="441.129" dur="5.01">health services and of course these are</text>
  <text start="442.99" dur="5.459">all low minimum wage jobs professional</text>
  <text start="446.139" dur="6.78">and business services while their</text>
  <text start="448.449" dur="9.9">openings fell to 275 274,000 in April</text>
  <text start="452.919" dur="7.8">and we need to remember one thing you</text>
  <text start="458.349" dur="5.761">can have millions and millions of</text>
  <text start="460.719" dur="6.69">openings that&amp;#39;s absolutely meaningless</text>
  <text start="464.11" dur="6.359">because when I was working for a</text>
  <text start="467.409" dur="6.72">corporation in Manhattan and it was a</text>
  <text start="470.469" dur="7.641">financial institution we had many many</text>
  <text start="474.129" dur="6.93">openings but we were on a hiring freeze</text>
  <text start="478.11" dur="5.44">now the openings stay there and they</text>
  <text start="481.059" dur="6.811">kept on adding more openings but we</text>
  <text start="483.55" dur="7.44">weren&amp;#39;t allowed to hire people this is</text>
  <text start="487.87" dur="5.189">to make it look good out in the</text>
  <text start="490.99" dur="5.219">workforce look at all these jobs that</text>
  <text start="493.059" dur="5.25">are opening but no one is hiring and</text>
  <text start="496.209" dur="6.11">this is exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="498.309" dur="9.51">now actually if we go back in time and</text>
  <text start="502.319" dur="13.03">we go back to the year of 2006 leading</text>
  <text start="507.819" dur="11.431">into 2007 the job openings look very</text>
  <text start="515.349" dur="11.941">very similar to what we are seeing now</text>
  <text start="519.25" dur="11.61">and at that 2007 area it started to</text>
  <text start="527.29" dur="7.62">decline and we are seeing the same thing</text>
  <text start="530.86" dur="8.43">right now and we can see right now is</text>
  <text start="534.91" dur="7.77">that from the job numbers there are no</text>
  <text start="539.29" dur="6.33">jobs out there those people that are</text>
  <text start="542.68" dur="5.31">coming out of college who are saying oh</text>
  <text start="545.62" dur="4.949">I get this great job I&amp;#39;m going to make a</text>
  <text start="547.99" dur="5.18">nice living I&amp;#39;m going to buy a house I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="550.569" dur="7.02">going to buy a car well guess what</text>
  <text start="553.17" dur="7.96">that&amp;#39;s not working either the US</text>
  <text start="557.589" dur="6.24">government over the last 15 years made a</text>
  <text start="561.13" dur="5">trillion dollar investment to improve</text>
  <text start="563.829" dur="5.731">the nation&amp;#39;s workforce</text>
  <text start="566.13" dur="6.21">now a big portion of that investment yes</text>
  <text start="569.56" dur="7.41">that it went into the student loan</text>
  <text start="572.34" dur="7.6">market to get people back into school so</text>
  <text start="576.97" dur="7.47">they can get these incredible jobs now</text>
  <text start="579.94" dur="7.32">they invested in human capital and the</text>
  <text start="584.44" dur="5.76">government helped tens of millions you</text>
  <text start="587.26" dur="7.5">know pay for their tuition with through</text>
  <text start="590.2" dur="8.25">loans and graduate schools sword twenty</text>
  <text start="594.76" dur="6.6">four percent in 2002 to 2012 and we saw</text>
  <text start="598.45" dur="4.94">it everything increase and everyone see</text>
  <text start="601.36" dur="3.87">so everyone&amp;#39;s going back to school</text>
  <text start="603.39" dur="4.03">everything is going to be fine</text>
  <text start="605.23" dur="7.08">everyone&amp;#39;s going to find an incredible</text>
  <text start="607.42" dur="8.54">job well new research that came out said</text>
  <text start="612.31" dur="7.26">this entire plan completely backfired</text>
  <text start="615.96" dur="8.14">millions of students are worse off now</text>
  <text start="619.57" dur="6.36">for having to go to school many never</text>
  <text start="624.1" dur="6.93">learn new skills because they dropped</text>
  <text start="625.93" dur="8.85">out many who stayed in school learned no</text>
  <text start="631.03" dur="7.5">skills whatsoever and guess what they</text>
  <text start="634.78" dur="10.58">got at the end of graduation a huge debt</text>
  <text start="638.53" dur="12.17">bill and they&amp;#39;re unable to repay it now</text>
  <text start="645.36" dur="8.62">we can see that many of these graduates</text>
  <text start="650.7" dur="6.69">they&amp;#39;re working part-time jobs they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="653.98" dur="7.07">going for loan modification because</text>
  <text start="657.39" dur="6.84">there&amp;#39;s nothing out there for them and</text>
  <text start="661.05" dur="8.2">these graduates are going to be trapped</text>
  <text start="664.23" dur="7.3">in this debt arena for a very long time</text>
  <text start="669.25" dur="4.26">and it&amp;#39;s not going to help the nation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="671.53" dur="4.41">economy actually it&amp;#39;s going to hurt it</text>
  <text start="673.51" dur="5.61">in the long run and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="675.94" dur="6.15">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and as we move</text>
  <text start="679.12" dur="5.28">forward there are no jobs and</text>
  <text start="682.09" dur="6.57">continually going to school is not going</text>
  <text start="684.4" dur="6.75">to help a lot of the manufacturing jobs</text>
  <text start="688.66" dur="4.86">have left a lot of the big businesses</text>
  <text start="691.15" dur="5.25">are leaving and that&amp;#39;s all that&amp;#39;s left</text>
  <text start="693.52" dur="5.85">are these minimum wage low-paying jobs</text>
  <text start="696.4" dur="7.77">and we can see it by the job</text>
  <text start="699.37" dur="7.95">numbers so what we&amp;#39;re looking at right</text>
  <text start="704.17" dur="7.2">now is the economy is continually</text>
  <text start="707.32" dur="7.709">deteriorating America isn&amp;#39;t what it was</text>
  <text start="711.37" dur="8.25">once like manufacturing is left jabs</text>
  <text start="715.029" dur="9.721">have left we&amp;#39;re turning into a minimum</text>
  <text start="719.62" dur="7.92">wage service type of country and there</text>
  <text start="724.75" dur="6.42">is no improvement at this point and we</text>
  <text start="727.54" dur="6.84">can see that the dollar at this time it</text>
  <text start="731.17" dur="5.22">is collapsing many countries are out</text>
  <text start="734.38" dur="4.77">there they are dumping it from their</text>
  <text start="736.39" dur="5.91">reserves many countries are out there</text>
  <text start="739.15" dur="6.45">dumping Treasuries and we see that</text>
  <text start="742.3" dur="7.02">Russia and China they are building a new</text>
  <text start="745.6" dur="5.31">economic system and this has been in the</text>
  <text start="749.32" dur="5.13">works for quite a while it just didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="750.91" dur="5.64">happen yesterday they&amp;#39;ve been separating</text>
  <text start="754.45" dur="3.63">themselves from the dollar they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="756.55" dur="2.91">separating themselves from the Swift</text>
  <text start="758.08" dur="4.74">payment system creating their own</text>
  <text start="759.46" dur="6.379">mimicking everything that we have in the</text>
  <text start="762.82" dur="5.49">West and they&amp;#39;re creating it in the east</text>
  <text start="765.839" dur="6.521">well China is going to take the next</text>
  <text start="768.31" dur="8.219">step right now and they want the you</text>
  <text start="772.36" dur="6.96">want to go global and we see China is</text>
  <text start="776.529" dur="6.331">going to grant the u.s. a 250 billion</text>
