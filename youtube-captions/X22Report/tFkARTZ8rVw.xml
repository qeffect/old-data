  <text start="182.84" dur="3.39">countries are turning towards China</text>
  <text start="184.37" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re turning towards Russia and</text>
  <text start="186.23" dur="6.72">looking away from Europe and the United</text>
  <text start="189.56" dur="6.78">States now we understand in Sandy Hook</text>
  <text start="192.95" dur="5.4">we had that mass shooting and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="196.34" dur="4.77">lot of information coming out of there</text>
  <text start="198.35" dur="4.74">that it was a staged event which I do</text>
  <text start="201.11" dur="4.05">believe it was completely stage from all</text>
  <text start="203.09" dur="5.55">the evidence that i see this does not</text>
  <text start="205.16" dur="4.44">look like a real scenario of a mass</text>
  <text start="208.64" dur="3.33">shooting but what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="209.6" dur="6">about this is that the lead investigator</text>
  <text start="211.97" dur="7.17">of Sandy Hook Major William Potter</text>

  <text start="221.78" dur="4.5">report yet of how he died but it always</text>
  <text start="224.57" dur="4.77">seems like the people that are working</text>
  <text start="226.28" dur="4.86">on these type of mass shootings or</text>
  <text start="229.34" dur="4.739">different type of cases that are</text>
  <text start="231.14" dur="7.43">completely staged the certain people end</text>
  <text start="234.079" dur="7.231">up dying for some reason or another now</text>

  <text start="261.169" dur="5.461">manufacturers his bill has two parts to</text>
  <text start="264.68" dur="3.84">it the first part is any action by the</text>
  <text start="266.63" dur="4.59">federal deposit deposit insurance</text>

  <text start="292.31" dur="4.86">dealer or importer of firearms or</text>
  <text start="294.59" dur="4.32">ammunition the Senators amendment was</text>
  <text start="297.17" dur="3.24">aimed at protecting firearms and</text>
  <text start="298.91" dur="3.96">ammunition manufacturers and dealers</text>
  <text start="300.41" dur="5.04">from the Justice Department&amp;#39;s operation</text>
  <text start="302.87" dur="6.66">choke point now what is operation choke</text>
  <text start="305.45" dur="8.84">point well they&amp;#39;re putting together a a</text>
  <text start="309.53" dur="8.22">plan to stop credit from flowing to</text>
  <text start="314.29" dur="7.18">ammunition dealers and gun dealers the</text>
  <text start="317.75" dur="6.42">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation at</text>
  <text start="321.47" dur="6.3">the behest of Barack Obama has declared</text>
  <text start="324.17" dur="5.97">that gun stores are high-risk businesses</text>
  <text start="327.77" dur="5.48">and before the high-risk businesses were</text>
  <text start="330.14" dur="5.37">pretty much drug drug paraphernalia</text>
  <text start="333.25" dur="4.87">pornographers and payday loan lenders</text>
  <text start="335.51" dur="5.13">now they&amp;#39;ve added other industries into</text>
  <text start="338.12" dur="4.47">this high-risk where banks can decide</text>
  <text start="340.64" dur="4.02">like oh okay I don&amp;#39;t want to give any</text>
  <text start="342.59" dur="5.19">type of processing of credit to these</text>
  <text start="344.66" dur="6.96">people and now they&amp;#39;re include gun and</text>
  <text start="347.78" dur="6.51">ammunition and coin dealers which is</text>
  <text start="351.62" dur="5.34">very interesting so those people trading</text>
  <text start="354.29" dur="5.07">coins that have to do a gold and silver</text>
  <text start="356.96" dur="6.09">they are high-risk businesses and you</text>
  <text start="359.36" dur="6.18">can see this is they work around to get</text>
  <text start="363.05" dur="4.71">ammunition out of the hands of the</text>
  <text start="365.54" dur="5.19">people because without ammunition the</text>
  <text start="367.76" dur="4.71">gun is kind of worthless and you can see</text>
  <text start="370.73" dur="3.98">this has nothing to do with the safety</text>
  <text start="372.47" dur="5.64">of the people this has to do with</text>
  <text start="374.71" dur="6.13">stopping the flow of arms and ammunition</text>
  <text start="378.11" dur="3.9">to everyday law-abiding citizens and you</text>
  <text start="380.84" dur="3.6">can see the amount of laws that the</text>
  <text start="382.01" dur="3.84">putting in place and this has nothing to</text>
  <text start="384.44" dur="3.15">do with safety because ever really have</text>
  <text start="385.85" dur="3.78">to do with safety you would see things</text>
  <text start="387.59" dur="3.57">that had to do with the schools if they</text>
  <text start="389.63" dur="4.08">really wanted to keep the schools safe</text>
  <text start="391.16" dur="4.62">they would have armed guards inside the</text>
  <text start="393.71" dur="5.49">school&amp;#39;s keeping them safe because it is</text>
  <text start="395.78" dur="6.84">shown that people with weapons in a</text>
  <text start="399.2" dur="6.24">certain place those criminal types</text>
  <text start="402.62" dur="4.5">usually stay away from that area and if</text>
  <text start="405.44" dur="3.539">we look at many of the mass shoot</text>
  <text start="407.12" dur="4.049">what are we seeing here well most of</text>
  <text start="408.979" dur="4.831">them on stage but those that haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="411.169" dur="5.071">been are in areas of gun-free zones I</text>
  <text start="413.81" dur="3.9">mean look at Chicago Chicago is a</text>
  <text start="416.24" dur="3.899">gun-free zone they have lots of</text>
  <text start="417.71" dur="5.19">legislation and the gun crime there is</text>
  <text start="420.139" dur="6.06">completely out of control because</text>
  <text start="422.9" dur="5.519">criminals know how to get the guns they</text>
  <text start="426.199" dur="4.171">don&amp;#39;t go to the stores they buy it on</text>
  <text start="428.419" dur="8.22">the black market it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="430.37" dur="8.85">completely unrealistic to think by</text>
  <text start="436.639" dur="4.471">putting all this all these bills and</text>
  <text start="439.22" dur="4.38">legislation into place that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="441.11" dur="5.429">going to you know keep the people safe</text>
  <text start="443.6" dur="5.31">this is the illusion that they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="446.539" dur="4.651">everyone believe in but when in reality</text>
  <text start="448.91" dur="4.56">what it really is is they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="451.19" dur="4.229">arms and ammunition going to the people</text>
  <text start="453.47" dur="3.21">because we understand the collapse is</text>
  <text start="455.419" dur="5.011">coming and they&amp;#39;re trying to keep this</text>
  <text start="456.68" dur="7.35">away from the people now we understand</text>
  <text start="460.43" dur="5.609">that DHS is pretty much bringing in all</text>
  <text start="464.03" dur="4.41">local law enforcement into compliance</text>
  <text start="466.039" dur="5.911">with DHS they&amp;#39;re giving them a lot of</text>
  <text start="468.44" dur="6.33">material like armament tanks weapons</text>
  <text start="471.95" dur="6.06">ammunition and electronic spy equipment</text>
  <text start="474.77" dur="5.07">and right now it seems like police have</text>
  <text start="478.01" dur="4.469">been using this new stingray mobile</text>
  <text start="479.84" dur="5.94">phone snooping device where it simulates</text>
  <text start="482.479" dur="5.071">a phone tower and allows phone calls to</text>
  <text start="485.78" dur="4.44">be intercepted into this and this way</text>
  <text start="487.55" dur="5.13">the police can spy on you and right now</text>
  <text start="490.22" dur="4.5">it seems like they&amp;#39;re trying to hide the</text>
  <text start="492.68" dur="3.63">fact that they&amp;#39;re actually using this of</text>
  <text start="494.72" dur="2.52">course this is against the Fourth</text>
  <text start="496.31" dur="3.09">Amendment they&amp;#39;re not allowed to use</text>
  <text start="497.24" dur="4.26">this unless they have a warm the ACLU</text>
  <text start="499.4" dur="5.28">came out with perhaps the most explosive</text>
  <text start="501.5" dur="4.71">information so far a set of internal</text>
  <text start="504.68" dur="3.75">police emails showing that the US</text>
  <text start="506.21" dur="4.62">Marshals have been instructing police to</text>
  <text start="508.43" dur="4.739">lie to courts about the use of such</text>
  <text start="510.83" dur="3.99">devices specifically rather than</text>
  <text start="513.169" dur="3.691">revealing the use of the tool they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="514.82" dur="3.63">told just to tell the court they got the</text>
  <text start="516.86" dur="4.559">information from a confidential source</text>
  <text start="518.45" dur="4.68">while affidavits may initially note the</text>
  <text start="521.419" dur="4.321">use of such device the police are told</text>
  <text start="523.13" dur="4.53">to submit a new affidavit after the fact</text>
  <text start="525.74" dur="4.8">without mentioning this stingray device</text>
  <text start="527.66" dur="5.61">and seal the old one so that the that</text>
  <text start="530.54" dur="4.38">never becomes public this is the federal</text>
  <text start="533.27" dur="3.51">government loaning out equipment to</text>
  <text start="534.92" dur="4.67">spoof mobile phone towers to spy on</text>
  <text start="536.78" dur="5.27">people and then instructing the pull</text>
  <text start="539.59" dur="3.66">to hide or suppress this information by</text>
  <text start="542.05" dur="3.21">claiming that it came from a</text>
  <text start="543.25" dur="3.45">confidential source now of course</text>
  <text start="545.26" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;re doing this because they know</text>
  <text start="546.7" dur="3.12">this is completely against the Fourth</text>
  <text start="548.5" dur="3.45">Amendment they&amp;#39;re not allowed to do this</text>
  <text start="549.82" dur="4.68">and they&amp;#39;re trying to hide the fact that</text>
  <text start="551.95" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re spying on every single person in</text>
  <text start="554.5" dur="5.85">every single town in every single City</text>
  <text start="557.74" dur="6.81">and this is going on everywhere because</text>
  <text start="560.35" dur="7.29">most of the local law enforcement police</text>
  <text start="564.55" dur="5.88">are now in compliance with DHS and this</text>
  <text start="567.64" dur="5.07">is exactly how the government wants it</text>
  <text start="570.43" dur="5.04">because when everything starts to fall</text>
  <text start="572.71" dur="5.4">apart they&amp;#39;re going to activate DHS</text>
  <text start="575.47" dur="5.61">local law enforcement will be activated</text>
  <text start="578.11" dur="4.8">they will become in compliance with DHS</text>
  <text start="581.08" dur="4.62">and you will see a completely different</text>
  <text start="582.91" dur="8.55">side you will see a militarized force</text>
  <text start="585.7" dur="7.53">going after people now in Ukraine what</text>
  <text start="591.46" dur="4.38">are we seeing we&amp;#39;re seeing that the</text>
  <text start="593.23" dur="4.44">fighting is continuing even though</text>
  <text start="595.84" dur="4.95">poroshenko says I have a unilateral</text>
  <text start="597.67" dur="4.38">peace deal which means that you pretty</text>
  <text start="600.79" dur="3.12">much laid down your weapons and</text>
  <text start="602.05" dur="4.2">surrender and we&amp;#39;ll just call it peace</text>
  <text start="603.91" dur="4.74">well that&amp;#39;s ridiculous if we&amp;#39;re in war</text>
  <text start="606.25" dur="3.66">and one side says to the other hey</text>
  <text start="608.65" dur="3.3">listen here this is what this is my</text>
  <text start="609.91" dur="5.94">peace plan we&amp;#39;ll keep our weapons and</text>
  <text start="611.95" dur="5.49">everything you lay them down and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="615.85" dur="3.54">good to go if you don&amp;#39;t we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="617.44" dur="3.9">destroy you I mean this is the most</text>
  <text start="619.39" dur="3.84">ridiculous thing I&amp;#39;ve ever heard well</text>
  <text start="621.34" dur="3.81">the fighting is continuing East Ukraine</text>
  <text start="623.23" dur="4.02">despite the temporary ceasefire declared</text>
  <text start="625.15" dur="5.07">by ukrainian President poroshenko it</text>
  <text start="627.25" dur="5.4">seems like the Ukraine side is still</text>
  <text start="630.22" dur="4.77">shelling and still bombarding the</text>
  <text start="632.65" dur="6.06">Southeast region and of course</text>
  <text start="634.99" dur="6.66">poroshenko&amp;#39;s out there saying that if</text>
  <text start="638.71" dur="6.15">the southeast region of Donetsk starts</text>

  <text start="655.9" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re going to destroy you anyway and</text>
  <text start="657.61" dur="4.5">again you have to remember these people</text>
  <text start="659.92" dur="4.77">are fighting for their freedom for their</text>
  <text start="662.11" dur="4.92">their right to be separate and apart</text>
  <text start="664.69" dur="4.35">from the government if you really think</text>
  <text start="667.03" dur="3.51">back to the revolution here in the</text>
  <text start="669.04" dur="4.019">United States it&amp;#39;s really the same type</text>
  <text start="670.54" dur="4.079">of thing I mean the people</text>
  <text start="673.059" dur="3.33">here in the United States we&amp;#39;re fighting</text>

  <text start="679.809" dur="5.64">be part of you you can&amp;#39;t tell us what to</text>
  <text start="681.189" dur="6.66">do and again those people probably today</text>
  <text start="685.449" dur="3.96">they would be called terrorists and they</text>
  <text start="687.849" dur="4.83">would be committing terrorist acts just</text>
  <text start="689.409" dur="6.15">like the people in Donetsk they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="692.679" dur="5.7">the same exact scenario and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="695.559" dur="5.4">calling them terrorists today so I mean</text>
  <text start="698.379" dur="4.8">what are we seeing here we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="700.959" dur="4.56">people who want to be separate and apart</text>

  <text start="714.249" dur="4.92">to remember who is calling the shots it</text>
  <text start="715.929" dur="5.76">is the bankers they saying we need this</text>
  <text start="719.169" dur="5.7">country intact you better do it or</text>

  <text start="729.579" dur="3.87">said this is not a plan whatsoever</text>
  <text start="731.199" dur="4.71">you&amp;#39;re not going to have talks with us</text>
  <text start="733.449" dur="4.56">and you&amp;#39;re just saying you know lay down</text>
  <text start="735.909" dur="3.87">your weapons or to be destroyed there is</text>
  <text start="738.009" dur="4.65">no negotiation here so you know what</text>

  <text start="742.659" dur="4.62">freedom and that&amp;#39;s exactly what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="745.419" dur="4.38">doing now Russia on the other hand they</text>
  <text start="747.279" dur="4.95">are building up their troops for a</text>
  <text start="749.799" dur="4.86">surprise drill they have about sixty</text>

  <text start="763.869" dur="6.72">of Russia to Ukraine because Ukraine</text>
  <text start="766.719" dur="6.57">continually pass passes into Russia into</text>
  <text start="770.589" dur="4.74">over the border and you know of course</text>
  <text start="773.289" dur="4.89">if this happened to anywhere else that</text>
  <text start="775.329" dur="4.98">country would retaliate but Russia they</text>
  <text start="778.179" dur="4.08">step back right now they&amp;#39;re flexing</text>
  <text start="780.309" dur="3.42">their muscles just like NATO fluxes</text>
  <text start="782.259" dur="3.69">their muscles the United States fluxes</text>
  <text start="783.729" dur="5.19">their muscles and it&amp;#39;s a you know big</text>
  <text start="785.949" dur="6.93">show here to show that yes we have</text>
  <text start="788.919" dur="7.26">forces now the fighting is intensifying</text>
  <text start="792.879" dur="6.3">in Iraq at this time and thousands of</text>
  <text start="796.179" dur="4.71">Iraqis are parading in Baghdad they are</text>
  <text start="799.179" dur="4.41">and this is hundreds of thousands of</text>
  <text start="800.889" dur="5.46">Shiites parade in Baghdad and several</text>
  <text start="803.589" dur="3.331">other Shiite cities to show that yes we</text>
  <text start="806.349" dur="3.05">are ready</text>
  <text start="806.92" dur="5.58">battle they have weapons the Sunnis are</text>
  <text start="809.399" dur="4.541">approaching Baghdad and Baghdad is</text>
  <text start="812.5" dur="4.649">getting ready now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="813.94" dur="6.51">interesting is that in the midst of all</text>
  <text start="817.149" dur="5.31">this Isis the Sunnis they have time to</text>
  <text start="820.45" dur="4.47">tweet and we&amp;#39;ve seen this with the</text>
  <text start="822.459" dur="4.651">Syrian electronic army where of course</text>
  <text start="824.92" dur="4.289">when they were attacking CNN the</text>
  <text start="827.11" dur="5.43">government websites and other websites</text>
  <text start="829.209" dur="5.221">and they&amp;#39;re posting remarks like China</text>
  <text start="832.54" dur="4.44">is going to be dumping the dollar we</text>
  <text start="834.43" dur="5.04">kind of realize that this is really not</text>
  <text start="836.98" dur="4.77">the Syrian electronic army it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="839.47" dur="6.419">more propaganda and now we&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="841.75" dur="6.81">that Isis set up a tweet mocking</text>
  <text start="845.889" dur="4.771">Michelle Obama I mean is this the most</text>
  <text start="848.56" dur="5.43">ridiculous thing you ever heard of there</text>
  <text start="850.66" dur="6.119">in a battle in Iraq they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="853.99" dur="4.08">take over the country but they have time</text>
  <text start="856.779" dur="5.461">to sit around and say you know what</text>
  <text start="858.07" dur="7.23">let&amp;#39;s set up a tweak to to to mock</text>
  <text start="862.24" dur="5.37">Michelle Obama you can completely tell</text>
  <text start="865.3" dur="4.44">this is complete propaganda they are</text>
  <text start="867.61" dur="4.53">setting this up and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="869.74" dur="4.68">unbelievable now the Obama</text>
  <text start="872.14" dur="3.689">administration yesterday said that they</text>
  <text start="874.42" dur="3.69">have the ability to go wherever they</text>
  <text start="875.829" dur="4.471">want to do airstrikes the geographical</text>
  <text start="878.11" dur="4.53">locations are meaningless and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="880.3" dur="3.75">continuing on this type of stance the</text>
  <text start="882.64" dur="3.75">Obama administration is considering</text>
  <text start="884.05" dur="4.349">treating the crisis in Iraq and Syria in</text>
  <text start="886.39" dur="6.42">regards to the Islamic State of Iraq and</text>
  <text start="888.399" dur="8.041">Syria as a single challenge now it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="892.81" dur="5.639">same thing that&amp;#39;s going on really now</text>
  <text start="896.44" dur="5.31">how could that be we have the Sunni</text>
  <text start="898.449" dur="6.601">fighters in Iraq trying to overthrow the</text>
  <text start="901.75" dur="6.72">government we have the Isis and al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="905.05" dur="4.769">and the paid mercenaries all in Syria</text>
  <text start="908.47" dur="4.049">backed by the United States government</text>
  <text start="909.819" dur="4.89">trying to remove Assad but this is all</text>
  <text start="912.519" dur="4.231">the same thing no this is propaganda</text>
  <text start="914.709" dur="4.951">because they&amp;#39;re real motivation is to</text>
  <text start="916.75" dur="4.56">get into Syria the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="919.66" dur="3.06">has begun to consider the conflicts in</text>
  <text start="921.31" dur="5.16">Syria and Iraq as a single challenge</text>
  <text start="922.72" dur="6.119">with an al-qaeda-inspired in certain see</text>
  <text start="926.47" dur="3.9">threatening both countries governments</text>
  <text start="928.839" dur="3.171">and the region&amp;#39;s broader stability</text>
  <text start="930.37" dur="4.11">according to senior administration</text>
  <text start="932.01" dur="5.35">officials us can possibly approach the</text>
  <text start="934.48" dur="5.16">situation with one strategy and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="937.36" dur="2.51">also taking this one step further they</text>
  <text start="939.64" dur="3.83">are</text>
  <text start="939.87" dur="6.93">starting to blame Assad on the ISIS</text>
  <text start="943.47" dur="6.809">problem they&amp;#39;re saying that serious</text>
  <text start="946.8" dur="5.4">Assad helped Forge Isis so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="950.279" dur="3.331">really pushing this propaganda because</text>
  <text start="952.2" dur="4.8">we can see what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="953.61" dur="5.13">they need to get into Syria eventually</text>
  <text start="957" dur="3.9">what&amp;#39;s going to happen they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="958.74" dur="4.5">bring in well anyway they possibly can</text>
  <text start="960.9" dur="4.56">of course President Obama has a pen and</text>
  <text start="963.24" dur="3.27">a paper he can do whatever he wants but</text>
  <text start="965.46" dur="4.08">he really can&amp;#39;t because of the</text>
  <text start="966.51" dur="5.61">Constitution but they will try to bring</text>
  <text start="969.54" dur="5.43">war to Syria because this is their main</text>
  <text start="972.12" dur="4.89">focus right now and the only way I see</text>
  <text start="974.97" dur="4.05">them doing this is with some type of an</text>
  <text start="977.01" dur="3.15">event unless Congress declares war and</text>
  <text start="979.02" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re all of a sudden they have</text>
  <text start="980.16" dur="5.07">airstrikes in Iraq and they say the</text>
  <text start="983.01" dur="3.69">fighting has to continue into Syria but</text>
  <text start="985.23" dur="4.53">it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter how they do</text>
  <text start="986.7" dur="5.52">this there will be some type of an event</text>
  <text start="989.76" dur="4.56">I mean there&amp;#39;s just no way around this</text>
  <text start="992.22" dur="4.92">at this time they will have to gin</text>
  <text start="994.32" dur="5.1">something up and make the people say you</text>
  <text start="997.14" dur="4.56">know what we had enough we need to go to</text>
  <text start="999.42" dur="4.23">war and it seems like they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="1001.7" dur="4.02">pushing this agenda at this time but</text>
  <text start="1003.65" dur="4.02">again anything can happen but we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="1005.72" dur="5.28">to see how this plays out now we</text>
  <text start="1007.67" dur="6.12">understand a lot of children are coming</text>
  <text start="1011" dur="4.589">across the border in Texas from Mexico</text>
  <text start="1013.79" dur="4.11">and the United States is housing them</text>
  <text start="1015.589" dur="5.971">and we&amp;#39;re just saying droves and droves</text>
  <text start="1017.9" dur="6.14">of these immigrants and of course this</text>
  <text start="1021.56" dur="4.83">is all planned by the administration</text>
  <text start="1024.04" dur="5.47">again you have to remember they want to</text>
  <text start="1026.39" dur="4.919">legalize all these people they want to</text>
  <text start="1029.51" dur="4.14">give them medical benefits they want</text>
  <text start="1031.309" dur="5.611">them to vote and they want to keep the</text>
  <text start="1033.65" dur="5.789">cost of corporation labor way way down</text>
  <text start="1036.92" dur="5.039">and these people coming across will work</text>
  <text start="1039.439" dur="4.321">for peanuts and we can see this is</text>
  <text start="1041.959" dur="4.051">really starting to build up and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1043.76" dur="3.78">happening right now is military groups</text>
  <text start="1046.01" dur="3.21">in Texas and across the nation or</text>
  <text start="1047.54" dur="4.65">responding to the Texas border surge</text>
  <text start="1049.22" dur="4.53">announced Wednesday night by the offices</text>
  <text start="1052.19" dur="3.81">of the governor lieutenant governor and</text>
  <text start="1053.75" dur="3.84">Texas House Speaker an announcement was</text>
  <text start="1056" dur="3.99">made on several new media outlets</text>
  <text start="1057.59" dur="4.74">including Facebook it&amp;#39;s the alert to the</text>
  <text start="1059.99" dur="7.65">civilian militia groups that they should</text>
  <text start="1062.33" dur="7.59">come down and create a wall of men to</text>
  <text start="1067.64" dur="5.06">stop all these immigrants coming into</text>
  <text start="1069.92" dur="4.31">the country and turn them around and</text>
  <text start="1072.7" dur="3.87">worse United States government is out</text>
  <text start="1074.23" dur="4.02">there saying well we really shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="1076.57" dur="4.62">doing this because this could turn into</text>
  <text start="1078.25" dur="4.2">something really really bad and yes the</text>
  <text start="1081.19" dur="3.39">only way it would turn into something</text>
  <text start="1082.45" dur="4.23">bad is if the government gets involved</text>
  <text start="1084.58" dur="4.08">and makes it look like something really</text>
  <text start="1086.68" dur="3.3">happened when it really didn&amp;#39;t and of</text>
  <text start="1088.66" dur="3.33">course then they can blame it on the</text>
  <text start="1089.98" dur="3.84">militia and then we can see martial law</text>
  <text start="1091.99" dur="4.14">and we can see how they could turn this</text>
  <text start="1093.82" dur="4.59">entire thing around but all these people</text>
  <text start="1096.13" dur="3.48">coming into the country they should be</text>
  <text start="1098.41" dur="2.73">turned around because they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1099.61" dur="2.85">allowed in the country if they want to</text>
  <text start="1101.14" dur="4.02">come through the cut into the country</text>
  <text start="1102.46" dur="4.32">they have to do it legally and right now</text>
  <text start="1105.16" dur="2.88">they&amp;#39;re trying to block because the</text>
  <text start="1106.78" dur="3.96">United States government is not doing</text>
  <text start="1108.04" dur="5.04">their job actually we&amp;#39;ve heard that they</text>
  <text start="1110.74" dur="4.56">haven&amp;#39;t been instructed not to do</text>
  <text start="1113.08" dur="3.96">anything and let them through and there</text>
  <text start="1115.3" dur="3.9">have been reports that every time all</text>
  <text start="1117.04" dur="3.72">these people come through it seems like</text>
  <text start="1119.2" dur="4.14">the border agents are leaving their</text>
  <text start="1120.76" dur="6.09">posts and going someplace else so now</text>
  <text start="1123.34" dur="5.82">we&amp;#39;re going to have a wall of men made</text>
  <text start="1126.85" dur="4.23">up of the militia and who knows what the</text>
  <text start="1129.16" dur="5.1">government is going to going to try to</text>
