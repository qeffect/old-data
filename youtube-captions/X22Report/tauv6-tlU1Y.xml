  <text start="58.899" dur="4.081">go back and take a listen to that why I</text>
  <text start="60.969" dur="3.891">said that I have no clue I guess I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="62.98" dur="4.889">still in the mindset that it&amp;#39;s October</text>
  <text start="64.86" dur="6.31">but let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="67.869" dur="6.391">news what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that France</text>
  <text start="71.17" dur="4.98">their credit rating has been lowered SP</text>
  <text start="74.26" dur="4.8">came out and said we are going from a</text>
  <text start="76.15" dur="6.149">a-plus to AAA and you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="79.06" dur="5.46">citing poor economic growth and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="82.299" dur="4.981">seeing that the government may fail to</text>
  <text start="84.52" dur="4.5">spur medium-term growth and I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="87.28" dur="5.61">tell you this right now they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="89.02" dur="6.889">fail to create any type of growth these</text>
  <text start="92.89" dur="7.979">countries in the eurozone and the US</text>
  <text start="95.909" dur="7.511">have huge amount of debt very high</text>
  <text start="100.869" dur="5.761">unemployment and they&amp;#39;re implementing</text>
  <text start="103.42" dur="6.69">austerity they&amp;#39;re trying to put tax more</text>
  <text start="106.63" dur="8.04">taxes on the people and this is a no-win</text>
  <text start="110.11" dur="8.28">situation this will not end well and we</text>
  <text start="114.67" dur="6.51">will see nothing of nothing like what</text>
  <text start="118.39" dur="6.689">anyone thinks the illusion is completely</text>
  <text start="121.18" dur="7.77">gone these economies are in a recession</text>
  <text start="125.079" dur="6.931">slash depression and so is the u.s. I</text>
  <text start="128.95" dur="6.42">mean really if you go back and you look</text>
  <text start="132.01" dur="5.089">at everything and you get rid of all the</text>
  <text start="135.37" dur="5.19">manipulation and everything like that</text>
  <text start="137.099" dur="10.091">the u.s. is really heading into a</text>
  <text start="140.56" dur="10.2">depression at this time but here in out</text>
  <text start="147.19" dur="5.97">in Greece they are having major major</text>
  <text start="150.76" dur="4.74">problems prices of goods in Greece from</text>
  <text start="153.16" dur="4.92">milk and bread and medicine have fallen</text>
  <text start="155.5" dur="8.73">by two percent in the last year and now</text>
  <text start="158.08" dur="10.37">are at their lowest since 1962 they have</text>
  <text start="164.23" dur="7.589">been in a deep recession for six years</text>
  <text start="168.45" dur="6.31">unemployment and wage cuts have eroded</text>
  <text start="171.819" dur="8.011">demand and push prices to fifty year</text>
  <text start="174.76" dur="7.77">lows Greeks are nearly 40% poorer than</text>
  <text start="179.83" dur="5.31">five years ago and what did they do five</text>
  <text start="182.53" dur="6.36">years ago what did the central banks do</text>
  <text start="185.14" dur="8.819">they gave them more debt they pushed</text>
  <text start="188.89" dur="9.75">them they push the government to get rid</text>
  <text start="193.959" dur="6.541">of more jobs to cut programs so they can</text>
  <text start="198.64" dur="5.629">get more debt</text>
  <text start="200.5" dur="6.54">so debt piled upon debt unemployment</text>
  <text start="204.269" dur="6.521">continually going higher and what do</text>
  <text start="207.04" dur="6.78">they have today a collapsing society</text>
  <text start="210.79" dur="7.199">that is what we are going to see all</text>
  <text start="213.82" dur="7.139">across the eurozone and in the US</text>
  <text start="217.989" dur="6.261">because this is what debt does it</text>
  <text start="220.959" dur="7.141">doesn&amp;#39;t make things better for example</text>
  <text start="224.25" dur="7.959">take a regular family who&amp;#39;s living every</text>
  <text start="228.1" dur="5.609">day making $50,000 a year and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="232.209" dur="6.541">dead I&amp;#39;m not talking about their home</text>
  <text start="233.709" dur="9.481">their credit card debt is around 200,000</text>
  <text start="238.75" dur="10.079">on a $50,000 income there&amp;#39;s no way to</text>
  <text start="243.19" dur="8.82">support the payments on a debt that high</text>
  <text start="248.829" dur="6.181">so what does the family do they take out</text>
  <text start="252.01" dur="8.909">another credit card to give them a lump</text>
  <text start="255.01" dur="8.01">sum cash to help out with the huge</text>
  <text start="260.919" dur="6.75">amount of debt but eventually what</text>
  <text start="263.02" dur="6.75">happens that cash runs out and they</text>
  <text start="267.669" dur="4.531">still have the same revenue come in and</text>
  <text start="269.77" dur="4.47">now they are in worse shape because they</text>
  <text start="272.2" dur="4.71">had the debt and they just added</text>
  <text start="274.24" dur="4.709">more debt with no increase in revenue</text>
  <text start="276.91" dur="6.2">and what do we see in all of these</text>
  <text start="278.949" dur="7.291">countries the same exact thing in Greece</text>
  <text start="283.11" dur="6.88">debt another bailout debt</text>
  <text start="286.24" dur="5.37">let&amp;#39;s cut people from work so they have</text>
  <text start="289.99" dur="4.89">higher unemployment higher unemployment</text>
  <text start="291.61" dur="5.489">less revenue coming in now we need more</text>
  <text start="294.88" dur="4.62">debt now we have higher interest</text>
  <text start="297.099" dur="6.121">payments we have to cut more jobs cut</text>
  <text start="299.5" dur="7.139">more jobs we have less revenue nobody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="303.22" dur="7.8">working but we have these huge huge</text>
  <text start="306.639" dur="7.71">payments it cannot be sustained there is</text>
  <text start="311.02" dur="6.299">no way out here in the US it is</text>
  <text start="314.349" dur="6.121">happening the same exact way just think</text>
  <text start="317.319" dur="5.94">about it for a second the amount of</text>
  <text start="320.47" dur="5.22">people who are working the amount of</text>
  <text start="323.259" dur="5.101">people who have part-time jobs and the</text>
  <text start="325.69" dur="5.159">amount of debt the United States has as</text>
  <text start="328.36" dur="4.95">the debt continually Rises and if you</text>
  <text start="330.849" dur="5.731">notice the debt is going up faster and</text>
  <text start="333.31" dur="8.31">faster and faster I mean just take the</text>
  <text start="336.58" dur="12.11">time from 1913 to 2008 and then take the</text>
  <text start="341.62" dur="15.359">time from 2008 to 2013 from 2008 to 2013</text>
  <text start="348.69" dur="10.449">the debt has increased by eight to nine</text>
  <text start="356.979" dur="4.951">trillion dollars and when President</text>
  <text start="359.139" dur="6.09">Obama took office it was at something</text>
  <text start="361.93" dur="6.239">like nine trillion dollars so from 1913</text>
  <text start="365.229" dur="6.211">all the way up to 2008 the debt was nine</text>
  <text start="368.169" dur="6.361">trillion from 2008 to 2013</text>
  <text start="371.44" dur="5.61">it rose another eight to nine trillion</text>
  <text start="374.53" dur="4.77">and it&amp;#39;s expected to go much much higher</text>
  <text start="377.05" dur="4.5">and as soon as the government reopened</text>
  <text start="379.3" dur="5.04">they put on what is it between three to</text>
  <text start="381.55" dur="5.549">four hundred billion dollars just like</text>
  <text start="384.34" dur="4.889">that and it&amp;#39;s continually and right now</text>
  <text start="387.099" dur="4.201">they do not have a debt ceiling so they</text>
  <text start="389.229" dur="3.361">have a credit card with no limit and you</text>
  <text start="391.3" dur="3.299">know what happens with a credit card</text>
  <text start="392.59" dur="7.59">with no limit they just keep putting</text>
  <text start="394.599" dur="8.07">things on there okay so what else are we</text>
  <text start="400.18" dur="5.07">seeing around the world well we</text>
  <text start="402.669" dur="3.431">understand that most of the countries</text>
  <text start="405.25" dur="4.27">have</text>
  <text start="406.1" dur="5.45">a huge amount of people in poverty we</text>
  <text start="409.52" dur="5.04">understand the middle class is being</text>
  <text start="411.55" dur="4.9">completely wiped out we understand that</text>
  <text start="414.56" dur="3.93">unemployment is very high and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="416.45" dur="4.71">showing up in different areas it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="418.49" dur="5.28">showing up in retail sales it&amp;#39;s showing</text>
  <text start="421.16" dur="6.39">up in housing and now it&amp;#39;s showing up in</text>
  <text start="423.77" dur="7.2">fast-food McDonald&amp;#39;s right now is saying</text>
  <text start="427.55" dur="6.6">that their sales have missed estimates</text>
  <text start="430.97" dur="5.88">and McDonald&amp;#39;s Corp reported lower than</text>
  <text start="434.15" dur="6.75">expected comparable restaurant sales for</text>
  <text start="436.85" dur="7.7">October as their sales have fallen and</text>
  <text start="440.9" dur="8.28">what they expected they expected that</text>
  <text start="444.55" dur="6.85">October would be around 0.5 percent but</text>
  <text start="449.18" dur="6.99">the gross head was below the average</text>
  <text start="451.4" dur="7.41">analysts estimated at 0.6 percent so we</text>
  <text start="456.17" dur="6.24">can see what is happening here that the</text>
  <text start="458.81" dur="6.51">people just can&amp;#39;t afford anything right</text>
  <text start="462.41" dur="5.97">now and this is what we are seeing and</text>
  <text start="465.32" dur="5.43">if we look at the payroll and this came</text>
  <text start="468.38" dur="6.3">out today the October payroll they were</text>
  <text start="470.75" dur="5.28">they were expecting the unemployment to</text>
  <text start="474.68" dur="5.13">be much much different than what</text>
  <text start="476.03" dur="5.64">happened they expected 120,000 and it</text>
  <text start="479.81" dur="5.97">was nearly double that of two hundred</text>
  <text start="481.67" dur="7.41">and four thousand and the unemployment</text>
  <text start="485.78" dur="6.78">rate went from 7.2 to 7.3%</text>
  <text start="489.08" dur="10.08">so what are we seeing here we are seeing</text>
  <text start="492.56" dur="11.76">that 932 thousand Americans dropped out</text>
  <text start="499.16" dur="10.62">of the labor force in October this is a</text>
  <text start="504.32" dur="8.81">huge amount of people and the the labor</text>
  <text start="509.78" dur="4.86">force participation rate plunged from</text>
  <text start="513.13" dur="5.71">63.2%</text>
  <text start="514.64" dur="11.46">to 62.8% this is the lowest since 1978</text>
  <text start="518.84" dur="9.96">and right now this was the third highest</text>
  <text start="526.1" dur="5.4">monthly increase in people falling at a</text>
  <text start="528.8" dur="5.1">label force in US history</text>
  <text start="531.5" dur="6.51">so again we have to remember let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="533.9" dur="8.7">think here for a second the government</text>
  <text start="538.01" dur="8.76">does not count the people who fall off</text>
  <text start="542.6" dur="7.77">and are no longer looking for work they</text>
  <text start="546.77" dur="6.87">change this in 1994 and this is why the</text>
  <text start="550.37" dur="6.78">unemployment rate is around seven</text>
  <text start="553.64" dur="5.82">percent or so 7.3 percent if we look at</text>
  <text start="557.15" dur="6.87">the real calculation of unemployment it</text>
  <text start="559.46" dur="6.72">is around 25 percent right now and this</text>
  <text start="564.02" dur="5.13">is the huge difference and just to let</text>
  <text start="566.18" dur="6.21">you know if we keep this pace up right</text>
  <text start="569.15" dur="9.81">now of this many people falling off the</text>
  <text start="572.39" dur="10.56">labor force it will surpass the working</text>
  <text start="578.96" dur="7.2">Americans in four years so we will have</text>
  <text start="582.95" dur="5.76">more people out of work then people are</text>
  <text start="586.16" dur="4.5">actually working in four years of this</text>
  <text start="588.71" dur="5.49">keeps up and the trend right now is</text>
  <text start="590.66" dur="6.03">headed that way and guess what</text>
  <text start="594.2" dur="4.68">the globalists the elite essential</text>
  <text start="596.69" dur="4.65">bankers the US government they</text>
  <text start="598.88" dur="5.51">understand this they understand what is</text>
  <text start="601.34" dur="6.45">going to happen here they understand and</text>
  <text start="604.39" dur="7.03">we know they understand by their actions</text>
  <text start="607.79" dur="7.79">what have they been doing they have been</text>
  <text start="611.42" dur="7.65">implementing more taxes they have been</text>
  <text start="615.58" dur="7.36">implementing more laws like facta they</text>
  <text start="619.07" dur="6.63">have been creating capital controls in</text>
  <text start="622.94" dur="7.26">banks where you can&amp;#39;t move money out of</text>
  <text start="625.7" dur="8.25">the US they are going after people who</text>
  <text start="630.2" dur="6.15">have dual passports dual citizenship who</text>
  <text start="633.95" dur="5.04">are working outside of the United States</text>
  <text start="636.35" dur="6.57">in another country they want their money</text>
  <text start="638.99" dur="5.7">if you want to leave the US and turn in</text>
  <text start="642.92" dur="4.56">your passport and you&amp;#39;re no longer a</text>
  <text start="644.69" dur="7.35">citizen they are there&amp;#39;s a bill on the</text>
  <text start="647.48" dur="10.35">books right now to tax you 30% of your</text>
  <text start="652.04" dur="8.01">wealth so they are scrambling to prop up</text>
  <text start="657.83" dur="4.29">their revenue stream because they</text>
  <text start="660.05" dur="4.71">understand the amount of people that are</text>
  <text start="662.12" dur="6.18">actually going to be working is dropping</text>
  <text start="664.76" dur="7.11">dramatically every year and you can only</text>
  <text start="668.3" dur="7.8">keep the fake unemployment number</text>
  <text start="671.87" dur="11.159">going for so long now</text>
  <text start="676.1" dur="9.51">last month a whopping six hundred and</text>
  <text start="683.029" dur="8.31">twenty-three thousand full-time workers</text>
  <text start="685.61" dur="8.76">lost their jobs in October what does</text>
  <text start="691.339" dur="5.521">that that is a huge amount of people who</text>
  <text start="694.37" dur="4.98">are not working right now but where are</text>
  <text start="696.86" dur="4.5">the jobs like where we&amp;#39;re from all these</text>
  <text start="699.35" dur="5.28">full-time jobs and I in my other reports</text>
  <text start="701.36" dur="5.61">I continually let you know the layoffs</text>
  <text start="704.63" dur="4.26">and what huge companies are laying off</text>
  <text start="706.97" dur="3.53">and I kept on saying once these</text>
  <text start="708.89" dur="4.62">positions are gone</text>
  <text start="710.5" dur="5.23">these positions are gone for good they</text>
  <text start="713.51" dur="5.4">are not hiring anymore so these people</text>
  <text start="715.73" dur="5.85">who lost these jobs have to go find work</text>
  <text start="718.91" dur="6.27">someplace else and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="721.58" dur="6.75">that leisure hospitality retail and temp</text>
  <text start="725.18" dur="6.12">help namely minimum wage hotel workers</text>
  <text start="728.33" dur="8.34">and retailers amounted roughly half of</text>
  <text start="731.3" dur="8.37">all job gains so we lost a huge amount</text>
  <text start="736.67" dur="7.2">of full-time positions and we are</text>
  <text start="739.67" dur="6.66">gaining temp low-paying jobs at this</text>
  <text start="743.87" dur="4.77">time so you can see what is happening</text>
  <text start="746.33" dur="4.59">right now just to show you leisure and</text>
  <text start="748.64" dur="5.49">hospitality it was an increase of fifty</text>
  <text start="750.92" dur="5.55">fifty three thousand jobs retail was an</text>
  <text start="754.13" dur="4.77">increase of forty four thousand jobs</text>
  <text start="756.47" dur="4.68">right now so we can see what is</text>
  <text start="758.9" dur="6.09">happening right now if we go and we look</text>
  <text start="761.15" dur="8.93">at the youth unemployment the government</text>
  <text start="764.99" dur="7.38">is saying this is around 22 percent and</text>
  <text start="770.08" dur="6.52">now you know why we&amp;#39;re having a problem</text>
  <text start="772.37" dur="5.94">with student loans because people cannot</text>
  <text start="776.6" dur="3.66">find work and this is the government</text>
  <text start="778.31" dur="3.96">figures if we really look at the</text>
  <text start="780.26" dur="5.94">unmanipulated numbers the youth</text>
  <text start="782.27" dur="7.08">unemployment is around 50% approaching</text>
  <text start="786.2" dur="5.37">50% very close so we can see that things</text>
  <text start="789.35" dur="4.5">are not right and this is why you see</text>
  <text start="791.57" dur="4.59">them coming out and saying you know</text>
  <text start="793.85" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;ll help you modify your student loans</text>
  <text start="796.16" dur="4.74">we&amp;#39;ll make payments a lot lower maybe in</text>
  <text start="798.41" dur="4.919">some cases you will not have to pay</text>
  <text start="800.9" dur="4.11">because they&amp;#39;re realizing all these kids</text>
  <text start="803.329" dur="2.461">coming out of school who paid a lot of</text>
  <text start="805.01" dur="3.18">money to go to</text>

  <text start="949.319" dur="4.351">was all about and I said in my past</text>
  <text start="951.689" dur="4.05">reports that the way it was really</text>
  <text start="953.67" dur="3.509">developed was you know Obama went to the</text>
  <text start="955.739" dur="4.1">insurance companies and they said listen</text>
  <text start="957.179" dur="5.34">I like to create this fantastic a</text>
  <text start="959.839" dur="4.631">program where everyone get insurance and</text>
  <text start="962.519" dur="4.29">the insurance company says no problem is</text>

  <text start="995.939" dur="3.9">we&amp;#39;ll put a tax on the people and this</text>
  <text start="998.339" dur="3.75">way they&amp;#39;ll be forced to do it because</text>
  <text start="999.839" dur="4.41">they don&amp;#39;t want to be paying more taxes</text>
  <text start="1002.089" dur="4.201">they&amp;#39;d rather have health insurance yes</text>
  <text start="1004.249" dur="3.93">this is the perfect plan and for those</text>
  <text start="1006.29" dur="4.169">businesses that don&amp;#39;t give it to the</text>

  <text start="1021.019" dur="7.32">deductible so high then we will not have</text>
  <text start="1024.289" dur="5.341">to pay out hardly any insurance the</text>
  <text start="1028.339" dur="3.24">people because they have to meet these</text>

  <text start="1032.99" dur="5.25">deductibles reset year after year so</text>
  <text start="1035.839" dur="5.37">this is incredible and guess what</text>
  <text start="1038.24" dur="6.809">President President Obama you can use</text>
  <text start="1041.209" dur="6.36">this as a great program for every single</text>
  <text start="1045.049" dur="4.051">American showing them that you care</text>
  <text start="1047.569" dur="3.661">about them that you&amp;#39;re going to give</text>
  <text start="1049.1" dur="4.23">them insurance and no one will be the</text>
  <text start="1051.23" dur="4.079">wiser and you can put other stuff in</text>
  <text start="1053.33" dur="3.54">that you know document of 3,500 pages</text>
  <text start="1055.309" dur="4.651">and no one will even read it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1056.87" dur="5.22">fantastic this is great all there&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="1059.96" dur="4.29">problem what about the military how what</text>
  <text start="1062.09" dur="3.959">are we going to do with them President</text>
  <text start="1064.25" dur="5.929">Obama said don&amp;#39;t worry about this I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1066.049" dur="6.921">handle this and what he did right now is</text>
  <text start="1070.179" dur="5.671">he is tripling the fee</text>
  <text start="1072.97" dur="8.06">on the military health insurance program</text>
  <text start="1075.85" dur="9.72">called TRICARE forcing the military</text>
  <text start="1081.03" dur="9.94">forcing veterans out of the program and</text>
  <text start="1085.57" dur="8.46">forcing them to go to Obamacare the</text>
  <text start="1090.97" dur="5.24">exchange or the affordable care act it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1094.03" dur="5.4">the same thing the administration</text>
  <text start="1096.21" dur="5.95">officials told Congress that one goal of</text>
  <text start="1099.43" dur="5.61">the increased fees is to force military</text>
  <text start="1102.16" dur="5.64">retirees to reduce their involvement in</text>
  <text start="1105.04" dur="6.02">TRICARE and eventually opt out of the</text>
  <text start="1107.8" dur="5.52">program in favor of alternatives</text>
  <text start="1111.06" dur="6.16">established by the 2010 Patient</text>
  <text start="1113.32" dur="6.42">Protection and Affordable Care Act you</text>
  <text start="1117.22" dur="5.34">can see what they are doing they are</text>
  <text start="1119.74" dur="5.34">doing this on purpose the government</text>
  <text start="1122.56" dur="4.77">knew that all of these people would lose</text>
  <text start="1125.08" dur="6.05">their health insurance so really what</text>
  <text start="1127.33" dur="8.28">they have done was they have created a</text>
  <text start="1131.13" dur="5.77">cash grab the government realizes from</text>
  <text start="1135.61" dur="2.88">those people who are not going to take</text>
  <text start="1136.9" dur="3.81">the insurance and just take the</text>
  <text start="1138.49" dur="4.77">penalties they will have a revenue</text>
  <text start="1140.71" dur="4.95">increase of two hundred billion and like</text>
  <text start="1143.26" dur="4.65">I said when a government is at the</text>
  <text start="1145.66" dur="4.32">endgame they increase taxes</text>
  <text start="1147.91" dur="3.96">anywhere they can and you can see what</text>
  <text start="1149.98" dur="4.68">is happening right now they are also</text>
  <text start="1151.87" dur="5.22">trying to create attacks on the stock</text>
  <text start="1154.66" dur="4.14">market where every single trade there</text>
  <text start="1157.09" dur="3.42">will be a tax and that&amp;#39;s another bill</text>
  <text start="1158.8" dur="4.74">that is introduced into the legislation</text>
  <text start="1160.51" dur="5.31">so you can see that every country I mean</text>
  <text start="1163.54" dur="5.25">France was having a protest and rioting</text>
  <text start="1165.82" dur="5.52">because of their echo tax every country</text>
  <text start="1168.79" dur="5.91">who is in trouble will try to create</text>
  <text start="1171.34" dur="6.87">more and more taxes to create revenue</text>
  <text start="1174.7" dur="6.75">because as there are less people working</text>
  <text start="1178.21" dur="5.34">that is less revenue to pay off the debt</text>
  <text start="1181.45" dur="4.8">so the only way to do this is to take</text>
  <text start="1183.55" dur="4.86">those people who are working and make</text>
  <text start="1186.25" dur="8.31">them pay more and this is what we are</text>
  <text start="1188.41" dur="8.43">seeing right now now to prepare for all</text>
  <text start="1194.56" dur="4.56">of this we see many things happening we</text>
  <text start="1196.84" dur="4.83">see DHS buying you know billions around</text>
  <text start="1199.12" dur="4.59">the bullets buying armored tanks there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1201.67" dur="3.75">a report in Canada that they&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="1203.71" dur="3.15">started buying tanks to do the same</text>
  <text start="1205.42" dur="3.119">exact thing</text>
  <text start="1206.86" dur="4.53">in Europe they&amp;#39;re creating their</text>
  <text start="1208.539" dur="5.551">eurozone Armed Forces just like DHS</text>
  <text start="1211.39" dur="4.71">right now we see TSA wants to be armed</text>
  <text start="1214.09" dur="3.9">they want to put them not just in the</text>
  <text start="1216.1" dur="4.29">airports they want to put them in the</text>
  <text start="1217.99" dur="5.16">malls the train station sporting events</text>
  <text start="1220.39" dur="6.09">and we are seeing this all over the</text>
  <text start="1223.15" dur="5.22">place and we are seeing that they are</text>
  <text start="1226.48" dur="3.179">pushing to have drones in the air</text>
  <text start="1228.37" dur="4.169">because this will make it a lot easier</text>
  <text start="1229.659" dur="4.441">for them to spot and to control the</text>
  <text start="1232.539" dur="3.541">people and especially when the drones</text>
  <text start="1234.1" dur="6.93">are armed it will make it a lot easier</text>
  <text start="1236.08" dur="9.209">for them to to control an area so right</text>
  <text start="1241.03" dur="7.74">now the FAA proposes widespread drones</text>
  <text start="1245.289" dur="5.25">in the US airspace by 2015 so that means</text>
  <text start="1248.77" dur="4.35">we&amp;#39;ll have drones flying around all over</text>
  <text start="1250.539" dur="6.181">the place and they are trying to push</text>
  <text start="1253.12" dur="6.6">this through and they are right now</text>
  <text start="1256.72" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re selecting six possible drone</text>
  <text start="1259.72" dur="5.52">test sites will be selected out of 26</text>
  <text start="1261.58" dur="7.2">proposed ones by the end of 2013 to test</text>
  <text start="1265.24" dur="5.669">all of this and someone came up with how</text>
  <text start="1268.78" dur="6.18">many drones will be flying in the air</text>
  <text start="1270.909" dur="7.711">and they are estimating about once this</text>
  <text start="1274.96" dur="6.599">all goes live about 7500 drones to</text>
  <text start="1278.62" dur="4.5">invade the skies over America now some</text>
  <text start="1281.559" dur="6.091">of them will be commercial and some will</text>
  <text start="1283.12" dur="6.39">be controlled by the DHS and what that</text>
  <text start="1287.65" dur="3.269">really turns out to be if you really</text>
  <text start="1289.51" dur="3.6">think about and you break it down per</text>
  <text start="1290.919" dur="7.441">state we&amp;#39;re looking at a hundred and</text>
  <text start="1293.11" dur="7.04">fifty drones in every state not counting</text>
  <text start="1298.36" dur="6.689">the ones that we don&amp;#39;t even know about</text>
  <text start="1300.15" dur="6.279">so at this point you can see the control</text>
  <text start="1305.049" dur="4.021">that they&amp;#39;re trying to put in place</text>
  <text start="1306.429" dur="5.73">because they realize they have a short</text>
  <text start="1309.07" dur="5.76">window here because they understand the</text>
  <text start="1312.159" dur="7.471">economy is falling apart and collapsing</text>
  <text start="1314.83" dur="5.849">at this time and they understand this</text>
  <text start="1319.63" dur="3.09">and what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is</text>
  <text start="1320.679" dur="5.071">increase the funding to DHS increase the</text>
  <text start="1322.72" dur="5.97">funding to TSA and increase the FEMA</text>
  <text start="1325.75" dur="5.82">funding and at the same time they are</text>
  <text start="1328.69" dur="6.15">decreasing the funds of the US military</text>
  <text start="1331.57" dur="6.69">and purging the people in the military</text>
  <text start="1334.84" dur="5.37">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1338.26" dur="5.67">administration defense policy</text>
  <text start="1340.21" dur="7.11">Miller Undersecretary of defense chuck</text>
  <text start="1343.93" dur="8.04">hagel on Friday is leaving his position</text>
  <text start="1347.32" dur="6.87">so this is another high-level departure</text>
  <text start="1351.97" dur="4.8">at the Pentagon and you can see there</text>
  <text start="1354.19" dur="6.96">are just many of these happening right</text>
  <text start="1356.77" dur="7.41">now and what I&amp;#39;ve said in previous</text>
  <text start="1361.15" dur="6.45">reports they are trying to purge the</text>
  <text start="1364.18" dur="6.33">military this will allow them eventually</text>
  <text start="1367.6" dur="4.65">to disarm the people of the United</text>
  <text start="1370.51" dur="5.73">States because their end goal right now</text>
  <text start="1372.25" dur="6">is to get rid of this pesky Constitution</text>
  <text start="1376.24" dur="4.77">and in the past what we&amp;#39;ve heard is</text>
  <text start="1378.25" dur="6">we&amp;#39;ve heard Mayor Bloomberg Harvard</text>
  <text start="1381.01" dur="5.91">professors and others saying that this</text>
  <text start="1384.25" dur="4.65">Constitution might be out of date at</text>
  <text start="1386.92" dur="5.85">this time and maybe we should look into</text>
  <text start="1388.9" dur="6.36">replacing it and this is their end goal</text>
  <text start="1392.77" dur="5.55">to get rid of it and the only way to do</text>
  <text start="1395.26" dur="4.89">this is to remove the weapons from the</text>
  <text start="1398.32" dur="6.6">people because when the people are not</text>
  <text start="1400.15" dur="7.35">armed what are they going to do to stop</text>
  <text start="1404.92" dur="4.56">them from removing the Constitution and</text>
  <text start="1407.5" dur="4.05">getting rid of it and we can see they</text>
  <text start="1409.48" dur="4.59">have already on that track to do this</text>
  <text start="1411.55" dur="5.4">the NDAA the Patriot Act all the other</text>
  <text start="1414.07" dur="5.04">HR bills that they put out there that</text>
  <text start="1416.95" dur="4.53">attack the First Amendment the Second</text>

  <text start="1421.48" dur="4.02">New York City I mean there are just so</text>
  <text start="1423.16" dur="4.86">many of these laws out there it is</text>
  <text start="1425.5" dur="6.44">absolutely ridiculous and we can see</text>
  <text start="1428.02" dur="8.94">where this is all completely heading now</text>
  <text start="1431.94" dur="8.29">we know that Saudi Arabia is looking to</text>
  <text start="1436.96" dur="4.95">acquire a nuclear weapon and for some</text>
  <text start="1440.23" dur="3.57">reason in my head I was thinking the</text>
  <text start="1441.91" dur="4.08">other day and I meant to mention this in</text>
  <text start="1443.8" dur="5.04">my other report let&amp;#39;s just think about</text>
  <text start="1445.99" dur="7.28">this for a second Saudi Arabia has no</text>
  <text start="1448.84" dur="8.13">problem acquiring an atomic bomb Iran</text>
  <text start="1453.27" dur="5.89">who have they been saying for over 25</text>
  <text start="1456.97" dur="4.14">years close to 30 years I guess right</text>
  <text start="1459.16" dur="3.72">now since 1979 whatever that calculation</text>
  <text start="1461.11" dur="4.26">turns out to be they&amp;#39;ve been saying Iran</text>
  <text start="1462.88" dur="4.02">is you know close to developing a</text>
  <text start="1465.37" dur="3.69">nuclear weapon and they&amp;#39;re about three</text>
  <text start="1466.9" dur="3.99">to five months out and this has been</text>
  <text start="1469.06" dur="3.63">going on for a very long time so what</text>
  <text start="1470.89" dur="3.01">happened was the United States went and</text>
  <text start="1472.69" dur="3.1">said you know what we&amp;#39;re going to put</text>
  <text start="1473.9" dur="3.75">on them we&amp;#39;re going to squeeze them</text>
  <text start="1475.79" dur="6.12">until they you know give up their</text>
  <text start="1477.65" dur="7.41">nuclear program and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1481.91" dur="5.97">going to do but Saudi Arabia which is</text>
  <text start="1485.06" dur="5.34">another Middle East country can just</text>
  <text start="1487.88" dur="4.47">acquire an atomic bomb so you have to</text>
  <text start="1490.4" dur="4.98">ask yourself what&amp;#39;s the difference the</text>
  <text start="1492.35" dur="5.76">difference is Saudi Arabia uses the US</text>
  <text start="1495.38" dur="5.4">dollar as a reserve currency they have a</text>
  <text start="1498.11" dur="5.55">private western central bank the United</text>
  <text start="1500.78" dur="7.22">States has a puppet government in Saudi</text>
  <text start="1503.66" dur="7.17">Arabia right now Syria and Iran do not</text>
  <text start="1508" dur="5.2">sell their natural resources using the</text>
  <text start="1510.83" dur="4.53">EU s dollar as a reserve currency and</text>
  <text start="1513.2" dur="4.2">they do not have a private western</text>
  <text start="1515.36" dur="2.88">central bank in their country neither</text>
  <text start="1517.4" dur="3.33">does Russia</text>
  <text start="1518.24" dur="6.45">neither does China neither does North</text>
  <text start="1520.73" dur="6.69">Korea and many other nations any country</text>
  <text start="1524.69" dur="4.05">that does not have a private western</text>
  <text start="1527.42" dur="3.66">central bank and not using the US</text>
  <text start="1528.74" dur="4.86">currency of the reserve currency is an</text>
  <text start="1531.08" dur="5.58">enemy to the globalists the elite the</text>
  <text start="1533.6" dur="7.29">central bankers so you can see what is</text>
  <text start="1536.66" dur="6.42">really going on here and why this is</text>
  <text start="1540.89" dur="5.12">happening now there are peace talks now</text>
  <text start="1543.08" dur="6.39">with Iran and this is a complete</text>
  <text start="1546.01" dur="8.5">smokescreen they want the people around</text>
  <text start="1549.47" dur="10.17">the world to believe that they really</text>
  <text start="1554.51" dur="8.52">want peace but before this happened long</text>
  <text start="1559.64" dur="5.79">before the nuclear deal was was was</text>
  <text start="1563.03" dur="4.5">talked about or anything the u.s. was</text>
  <text start="1565.43" dur="4.38">quietly lifting some of the financial</text>
  <text start="1567.53" dur="4.35">pressures on Iran the Obama</text>
  <text start="1569.81" dur="5.07">administration began softening sanctions</text>
  <text start="1571.88" dur="6.93">on Iran after the elections of Iran&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1574.88" dur="5.4">new president now why we and I said this</text>
  <text start="1578.81" dur="4.89">in my other reports why did he do that</text>
  <text start="1580.28" dur="5.64">because Iran is joining the BRIC nations</text>
  <text start="1583.7" dur="4.65">this is what they&amp;#39;re in the process of</text>
  <text start="1585.92" dur="4.86">doing right now where they might already</text>
  <text start="1588.35" dur="5.09">finish the process and once they are in</text>
  <text start="1590.78" dur="5.82">the sanctions will not work anymore and</text>
  <text start="1593.44" dur="5.53">this is why they are using this</text>
  <text start="1596.6" dur="4.65">smokescreen to show that they really</text>
  <text start="1598.97" dur="6.21">want peace and it&amp;#39;s all about their</text>
  <text start="1601.25" dur="6.24">nuclear weapons and we have to</text>
  <text start="1605.18" dur="5.16">understand that Obama&amp;#39;s strategy</text>
  <text start="1607.49" dur="5.46">was to squeeze Iran&amp;#39;s economy until Iran</text>
  <text start="1610.34" dur="4.5">would be willing to trade relief from</text>
  <text start="1612.95" dur="5.94">sanctions for abandoned key elements of</text>
  <text start="1614.84" dur="6.48">its nuclear program and Obama you know</text>
  <text start="1618.89" dur="4.32">he&amp;#39;s pressured I ran through isolating</text>
  <text start="1621.32" dur="3.96">the country&amp;#39;s banks from the global</text>
  <text start="1623.21" dur="3.93">financial sector the networks that make</text>
  <text start="1625.28" dur="4.02">modern international commerce possible</text>
  <text start="1627.14" dur="4.05">and that was his main goal but he</text>
  <text start="1629.3" dur="4.65">realized in the administration realized</text>
  <text start="1631.19" dur="4.44">that this will not be possible so they</text>
  <text start="1633.95" dur="5.75">understand what is happening so under</text>
  <text start="1635.63" dur="7.53">the pretense of easing sanctions and</text>
  <text start="1639.7" dur="6.16">going along with peace and this is what</text>
  <text start="1643.16" dur="5.37">we want it is an illusion it is a</text>
  <text start="1645.86" dur="7.38">smokescreen to make make people believe</text>
  <text start="1648.53" dur="6.39">that this is actually happening so what</text>
  <text start="1653.24" dur="4.2">does Iran want well</text>
  <text start="1654.92" dur="4.47">Iran has told Western powers that it</text>
  <text start="1657.44" dur="4.2">wants them to consider easing oil and</text>
  <text start="1659.39" dur="6.32">banking sanctions during the first phase</text>
  <text start="1661.64" dur="10.65">of the nuclear deal they agree to and</text>
  <text start="1665.71" dur="8.469">right now who Ralph Peters a retired</text>
  <text start="1672.29" dur="5.31">lieutenant colonel is out there saying</text>
  <text start="1674.179" dur="7.021">that Iran is losing nothing in the peace</text>
  <text start="1677.6" dur="5.25">Dale they are giving up nothing and what</text>
  <text start="1681.2" dur="4.17">he went on to say is based on the</text>
  <text start="1682.85" dur="4.47">details we know thus far the Iranians</text>
  <text start="1685.37" dur="5.01">give up nothing they destroy no</text>
  <text start="1687.32" dur="5.58">centrifuges they reverse no processes</text>
  <text start="1690.38" dur="4.23">they take a brief timeout while we</text>
  <text start="1692.9" dur="7.47">loosen sanctions enough to rescue their</text>
  <text start="1694.61" dur="8.55">collapsing economy and prime is Prime</text>
  <text start="1700.37" dur="4.95">Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told</text>
  <text start="1703.16" dur="3.96">reporters that Iran got the deal of the</text>
  <text start="1705.32" dur="5.37">century and the international community</text>
  <text start="1707.12" dur="7.559">got up bad deal and we can see how this</text>
  <text start="1710.69" dur="7.86">is playing out they are making you</text>
  <text start="1714.679" dur="6.721">believe that this is in the best</text>
  <text start="1718.55" dur="7.44">interest and that they are going for</text>
  <text start="1721.4" dur="6.74">peace but they are not and Netanyahu is</text>
  <text start="1725.99" dur="6.42">urging</text>
  <text start="1728.14" dur="7.68">US Secretary of State John Kerry not to</text>
  <text start="1732.41" dur="9.12">rush in and sign the deal with Iran but</text>
  <text start="1735.82" dur="9.28">this all of this right now is completely</text>
  <text start="1741.53" dur="6">a complete setup for what is coming and</text>
  <text start="1745.1" dur="4.71">you can and I&amp;#39;ll explain this as we go</text>
  <text start="1747.53" dur="7.8">further into this now at the same time</text>
  <text start="1749.81" dur="8.3">that Iran and the US are talking about</text>
  <text start="1755.33" dur="7.17">peace and about their nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="1758.11" dur="8.26">Israel comes out and says that Iran just</text>
  <text start="1762.5" dur="7.02">put up a video on how they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1766.37" dur="5.85">strike Israel and how they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1769.52" dur="5.13">use their nuclear weapons to strike</text>
  <text start="1772.22" dur="6.66">Israel they&amp;#39;re going to strike the</text>
  <text start="1774.65" dur="7.08">cities the IDF base headquarters and</text>
  <text start="1778.88" dur="5.31">they went on to say you know this is</text>
  <text start="1781.73" dur="9.66">this is what they&amp;#39;re really planning to</text>
  <text start="1784.19" dur="9.93">do so what we see right now is that the</text>
  <text start="1791.39" dur="3.41">US is in there talking peace and things</text>
  <text start="1794.12" dur="3.33">like that</text>
  <text start="1794.8" dur="8.11">everyone&amp;#39;s believing it Israel looks</text>
  <text start="1797.45" dur="8.73">upset and we&amp;#39;re relieving sanctions Iran</text>
  <text start="1802.91" dur="7.59">is getting everything and how can they</text>
  <text start="1806.18" dur="6.81">spin this well Iran didn&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="1810.5" dur="5.88">remove anything they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="1812.99" dur="4.8">doing what they&amp;#39;re doing so since</text>
  <text start="1816.38" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re doing what they&amp;#39;re doing and</text>
  <text start="1817.79" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re still you know they still have</text>
  <text start="1819.86" dur="4.77">their nuclear program</text>
  <text start="1821.12" dur="7.41">they now still have the ability to</text>
  <text start="1824.63" dur="6.9">create a nuclear weapon this will set up</text>
  <text start="1828.53" dur="7.68">the false flag because all these little</text>
  <text start="1831.53" dur="7.2">breadcrumbs of Iran using missiles to</text>
  <text start="1836.21" dur="5.16">strike Israel Iran a month away from</text>
  <text start="1838.73" dur="7.05">creating a nuclear weapon the United</text>
  <text start="1841.37" dur="6.63">States not not having Iran do anything</text>
  <text start="1845.78" dur="4.77">but keep their program not lose anything</text>
  <text start="1848" dur="5.28">they are setting this up completely</text>
  <text start="1850.55" dur="6">where the u.s. is saying we were looking</text>
  <text start="1853.28" dur="7.14">at peace and all of a sudden Iran came</text>
  <text start="1856.55" dur="7.35">out and planted a nuclear weapon in the</text>
  <text start="1860.42" dur="6.54">u.s. created and this this will be a</text>
  <text start="1863.9" dur="5.99">false flag completely and we can see how</text>
  <text start="1866.96" dur="6.54">this is definitely going to play out</text>
  <text start="1869.89" dur="5.169">into their game it is almost like the</text>
  <text start="1873.5" dur="5.19">false flag that happened in</text>
  <text start="1875.059" dur="5.73">Syria they gave you some breadcrumbs</text>
  <text start="1878.69" dur="4.89">they said they were talking peace they</text>
  <text start="1880.789" dur="4.14">were trying to help out and you know</text>
  <text start="1883.58" dur="2.969">they gave you the red lines of the</text>
  <text start="1884.929" dur="5.641">chemical weapons and things like that</text>
  <text start="1886.549" dur="6.391">and since the alternative media the</text>
  <text start="1890.57" dur="5.069">people of the US the Congress were all</text>
  <text start="1892.94" dur="6.18">on to this Russia was out there telling</text>
  <text start="1895.639" dur="5.28">what was going on and the UN inspectors</text>
  <text start="1899.12" dur="2.939">were out there and we know it was a</text>
  <text start="1900.919" dur="3.451">complete lie</text>
  <text start="1902.059" dur="3.75">because we understand that Assad invited</text>
  <text start="1904.37" dur="3.029">the new inspectors in and all of a</text>
  <text start="1905.809" dur="4.08">sudden he used chemical weapons I mean</text>
  <text start="1907.399" dur="5.041">it was all false so they lied the US</text>
  <text start="1909.889" dur="5.331">government lied to the people about the</text>
  <text start="1912.44" dur="6.27">chemical weapons and they understand</text>
  <text start="1915.22" dur="6.339">they can&amp;#39;t use this tactic anymore so</text>
  <text start="1918.71" dur="6.48">now they are switching it up they are</text>
  <text start="1921.559" dur="6.45">using the peace tactic well let&amp;#39;s go in</text>
  <text start="1925.19" dur="3.989">and look like the good guy we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1928.009" dur="2.91">in because you have to remember these</text>
  <text start="1929.179" dur="3.84">are the central bankers they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1930.919" dur="5.551">going to just let things collapse and</text>
  <text start="1933.019" dur="7.201">and not push their their agenda forward</text>
  <text start="1936.47" dur="6">no way this is never never going to stop</text>
  <text start="1940.22" dur="5.22">them so now they had to switch it up</text>
  <text start="1942.47" dur="6.27">because they realized it will never work</text>
  <text start="1945.44" dur="6.15">the other way so now they have to go and</text>
  <text start="1948.74" dur="8.519">pretend that they&amp;#39;re looking for peace</text>
  <text start="1951.59" dur="7.799">and then use the false flag at this time</text>
  <text start="1957.259" dur="4.11">and they&amp;#39;re going to try a different</text>
  <text start="1959.389" dur="3.63">tactic and that&amp;#39;s what they are moving</text>
  <text start="1961.369" dur="5.19">and doing right now</text>
  <text start="1963.019" dur="5.85">and they understand that this war will</text>
  <text start="1966.559" dur="5.61">eventually come and right now you know</text>
  <text start="1968.869" dur="5.91">Obama wants Japan to be able to wage war</text>
  <text start="1972.169" dur="6.72">against China so what is happening right</text>
  <text start="1974.779" dur="6.87">now is that we understand that Oh Japan</text>
  <text start="1978.889" dur="5.88">is re-examining the legal basis for</text>
  <text start="1981.649" dur="5.311">article 9 which allows them to not go to</text>

  <text start="2095.89" dur="7.2">strike Syria and they are doing the same</text>

  <text start="2151.16" dur="8.37">emails the stock exchange banks</text>
  <text start="2154.9" dur="8.32">companies Google Yahoo they had to</text>
  <text start="2159.53" dur="6.9">create and open a passageway a back door</text>
  <text start="2163.22" dur="8.12">for them for them to get in and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2166.43" dur="9.36">happening now is that cyber hackers are</text>
  <text start="2171.34" dur="6.94">finding these these backdoor backdoors</text>
  <text start="2175.79" dur="4.5">into the systems and we can see this was</text>
  <text start="2178.28" dur="4.67">actually done on purpose because this</text>
  <text start="2180.29" dur="6.93">will make it easier for a cyber attack</text>
  <text start="2182.95" dur="8.04">to occur as as things progress because</text>
  <text start="2187.22" dur="7.43">we understand that a cyber attack will</text>
  <text start="2190.99" dur="7.33">happen and it will be a false flag and</text>
  <text start="2194.65" dur="6.67">what we are seeing now is we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="2198.32" dur="7.83">who is doing this but we can you know we</text>
  <text start="2201.32" dur="6.45">can guess who is doing this the Google</text>
  <text start="2206.15" dur="5.15">web crawler I don&amp;#39;t know if everyone</text>
  <text start="2207.77" dur="6.72">knows what that is the web crawler is a</text>
  <text start="2211.3" dur="6.88">little bot that goes out from Google and</text>
  <text start="2214.49" dur="5.94">it visits sites and it reports how many</text>
  <text start="2218.18" dur="4.74">pages you have on your site and it</text>
  <text start="2220.43" dur="5.01">reports back to Google and it puts it in</text>
  <text start="2222.92" dur="4.56">their database so it can say you&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="2225.44" dur="3.6">the search engines so these little BOTS</text>
  <text start="2227.48" dur="2.76">go out all the day and they&amp;#39;re all over</text>
  <text start="2229.04" dur="4.17">the place all over the internet</text>
  <text start="2230.24" dur="4.98">searching and indexing your site and</text>
  <text start="2233.21" dur="3.45">recording all the pages and things like</text>
  <text start="2235.22" dur="3.6">that and they have different BOTS that</text>
  <text start="2236.66" dur="3.71">do different things and this is how they</text>
  <text start="2238.82" dur="4.56">were able to build their database</text>
  <text start="2240.37" dur="5.08">because they do not have to go out</text>
  <text start="2243.38" dur="5.45">themselves to find things these little</text>
  <text start="2245.45" dur="5.43">BOTS follow the links so if a site is</text>
  <text start="2248.83" dur="3.91">indexed and it has a link to another</text>
  <text start="2250.88" dur="3.66">site the little bot just hops onto the</text>
  <text start="2252.74" dur="4.05">link travels till the next site and</text>
  <text start="2254.54" dur="4.38">indexes that site and if that site has</text>
  <text start="2256.79" dur="3.63">another link to another site it follows</text>
  <text start="2258.92" dur="3.72">that link and this is how it works and</text>
  <text start="2260.42" dur="6.08">they&amp;#39;re able to index the entire web</text>
  <text start="2262.64" dur="7.83">this way so what they have realized</text>
  <text start="2266.5" dur="4.99">someone was able to modify these little</text>
  <text start="2270.47" dur="3.78">BOTS to</text>
  <text start="2271.49" dur="6.15">perform what&amp;#39;s called sequel injections</text>
  <text start="2274.25" dur="6.15">that attack sites and they do not</text>
  <text start="2277.64" dur="5.729">understand how this has happened but</text>
  <text start="2280.4" dur="6.63">they are turning these BOTS into like</text>
  <text start="2283.369" dur="6.451">little attack drones which go to a site</text>
  <text start="2287.03" dur="5.46">and they attack the database of the site</text>
  <text start="2289.82" dur="5.16">mostly every site has a database I mean</text>
  <text start="2292.49" dur="5.37">x-22 has a database the people has a</text>
  <text start="2294.98" dur="5.94">database and I get sequel injection</text>
  <text start="2297.86" dur="7.53">attacks all day long I&amp;#39;ve probably</text>
  <text start="2300.92" dur="7.38">blocked probably probably 80 or 90 IP</text>
  <text start="2305.39" dur="5.55">addresses since I&amp;#39;ve started this from</text>
  <text start="2308.3" dur="5.34">accessing the site because every day I</text>
  <text start="2310.94" dur="5.37">get an alert because I have a firewall</text>
  <text start="2313.64" dur="4.229">set up that someone is trying to inject</text>
  <text start="2316.31" dur="3.96">something into the database and bring</text>
  <text start="2317.869" dur="4.141">the site down and many many sites you</text>
  <text start="2320.27" dur="3.57">know have this done and if I look at the</text>
  <text start="2322.01" dur="3.42">IP addresses they&amp;#39;re coming from Russia</text>
  <text start="2323.84" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re coming from North Korea they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2325.43" dur="5.52">coming from China but that&amp;#39;s again that</text>
  <text start="2327.8" dur="7.11">is the last server I can see I can&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="2330.95" dur="7.02">where they came from before that so this</text>
  <text start="2334.91" dur="4.89">is what I&amp;#39;m seeing at this time and this</text>
  <text start="2337.97" dur="3.78">could be used whoever is doing this</text>
  <text start="2339.8" dur="5.64">could be used to get through the</text>
  <text start="2341.75" dur="8.91">backdoor and to be used with the cyber</text>
  <text start="2345.44" dur="7.86">attack now mi5 has come out and mi6 has</text>
  <text start="2350.66" dur="4.29">come out and they are giving a warning</text>
  <text start="2353.3" dur="5.96">that the jihadist threats are</text>
  <text start="2354.95" dur="7.77">multiplying as hundreds of terror</text>
  <text start="2359.26" dur="7.12">tourists head abroad for training and</text>
  <text start="2362.72" dur="7.56">they are saying that many terrorists now</text>
  <text start="2366.38" dur="7.11">are out there being trained and they are</text>
  <text start="2370.28" dur="5.7">very worried about this and another</text>
  <text start="2373.49" dur="5.76">warning that is out there is that al</text>
  <text start="2375.98" dur="7.4">Qaeda and its affiliate al-shabaab is</text>
  <text start="2379.25" dur="7.2">out there and they&amp;#39;re hiding among us in</text>
  <text start="2383.38" dur="5.5">our own communities a US military</text>
  <text start="2386.45" dur="6.6">official has worked in various parts of</text>
  <text start="2388.88" dur="7.05">Africa on counter terrorism has reported</text>
  <text start="2393.05" dur="4.2">that many times terror recruiters do</text>
  <text start="2395.93" dur="4.439">their jobs without drawing suspicion</text>
  <text start="2397.25" dur="6.18">from federal law enforcement&amp;#39;s community</text>
  <text start="2400.369" dur="4.291">leaders or the very families of those</text>
  <text start="2403.43" dur="3.57">they bring in</text>
  <text start="2404.66" dur="4.409">and there&amp;#39;s very worried about the</text>
  <text start="2407" dur="4.289">terrorist threat and there&amp;#39;s a warning</text>
  <text start="2409.069" dur="4.74">that Western nation should remain</text>
  <text start="2411.289" dur="4.951">vigilant against future planned attacks</text>
  <text start="2413.809" dur="7.411">and ones that could possibly carried out</text>
  <text start="2416.24" dur="7.4">by American or European recruits so we</text>
  <text start="2421.22" dur="5.04">can see what is happening at this time</text>
  <text start="2423.64" dur="5.409">they are setting the stage they are</text>
  <text start="2426.26" dur="7.47">setting everything up for the next false</text>
  <text start="2429.049" dur="6.57">flag event to bring us into war and we</text>
  <text start="2433.73" dur="3.839">could see what is happening right now we</text>
  <text start="2435.619" dur="4.261">can see from the picture and from all</text>
  <text start="2437.569" dur="4.53">the warnings and from everything that is</text>
  <text start="2439.88" dur="6.659">being done that something is definitely</text>
  <text start="2442.099" dur="7.171">on the horizon and with that we should</text>
  <text start="2446.539" dur="5.25">all be prepared for whatever could come</text>
  <text start="2449.27" dur="5.13">I mean if there is a blackout if there</text>
  <text start="2451.789" dur="6.121">is something to happen it just just</text>
  <text start="2454.4" dur="11.04">reminds me that many of the banks and</text>
  <text start="2457.91" dur="10.47">many retail stores are starting to move</text>
  <text start="2465.44" dur="6.24">their retail stores and banks off the</text>
  <text start="2468.38" dur="5.34">grid and supply their own electric</text>
  <text start="2471.68" dur="4.77">electricity to themselves with solar</text>
  <text start="2473.72" dur="8.01">panels and other technology because they</text>
  <text start="2476.45" dur="8.089">are saying that the the grid is unstable</text>
  <text start="2481.73" dur="7.109">at this time and they want to avoid</text>
  <text start="2484.539" dur="6.731">power outages so this gives us a little</text>
  <text start="2488.839" dur="5.25">glimmer into what they believe is going</text>
  <text start="2491.27" dur="6.39">to happen and you know and they believe</text>
  <text start="2494.089" dur="5.881">that some type of an attack might occur</text>
  <text start="2497.66" dur="4.169">and this is why they are getting off the</text>
  <text start="2499.97" dur="4.139">grid and we do understand that we do</text>
  <text start="2501.829" dur="4.681">have the grid extra coming up in</text>
  <text start="2504.109" dur="5.161">November we also understand that there</text>
  <text start="2506.51" dur="4.559">is a bank drill in England pretty much</text>
  <text start="2509.27" dur="6.36">at the same time and I said this</text>
  <text start="2511.069" dur="6">yesterday if we start seeing reports</text>
  <text start="2515.63" dur="3.929">that there have been cyber attacks</text>
  <text start="2517.069" dur="5.641">hitting certain banking certain</text>
  <text start="2519.559" dur="6.421">utilities ahead of time and you know</text>
  <text start="2522.71" dur="6.45">denial of service attacks we should get</text>
  <text start="2525.98" dur="3.75">ready but if we do not see anything like</text>
  <text start="2529.16" dur="3.03">that</text>
  <text start="2529.73" dur="4.02">I don&amp;#39;t believe something will occur do</text>
  <text start="2532.19" dur="5.23">I believe something will occur down the</text>
  <text start="2533.75" dur="6.309">line yes I do I do believe that</text>
  <text start="2537.42" dur="5.01">this is being set up people are being</text>
  <text start="2540.059" dur="3.841">trained people are getting ready and</text>
  <text start="2542.43" dur="3.72">they want to understand the inner</text>
  <text start="2543.9" dur="6.84">workings of how it will work out before</text>
  <text start="2546.15" dur="5.1">they unleash the next false flag listen</text>
