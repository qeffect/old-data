  <text start="56.86" dur="5.16">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.27" dur="7.02">episode 1602 a.n today&amp;#39;s date is June</text>
  <text start="62.02" dur="6.63">27th 2018 and the thought of the episode</text>
  <text start="65.29" dur="6.54">is IMF and China prepare for financial</text>
  <text start="68.65" dur="5.91">shocks and economic panic let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="71.83" dur="5.1">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="74.56" dur="5.55">for the past couple of months maybe in a</text>
  <text start="76.93" dur="5.97">year now the central banks and the</text>
  <text start="80.11" dur="5.28">corporate media and everyone else has</text>
  <text start="82.9" dur="5.85">been saying how dangerous crypto</text>
  <text start="85.39" dur="5.43">currencies were that this is coming from</text>
  <text start="88.75" dur="4.47">the banks and the central banks we need</text>
  <text start="90.82" dur="4.53">to protect the people they cannot</text>
  <text start="93.22" dur="5.819">purchase these using their credit cards</text>
  <text start="95.35" dur="5.519">their debit cards and this is very very</text>
  <text start="99.039" dur="2.461">scary for the people because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="100.869" dur="4.561">know what they&amp;#39;re getting themselves</text>
  <text start="101.5" dur="7.38">into and then all of a sudden we started</text>
  <text start="105.43" dur="5.18">to see crypto currency manipulated in a</text>
  <text start="108.88" dur="5.129">way that we&amp;#39;ve never seen before where</text>
  <text start="110.61" dur="7.84">certain entities were throwing a huge</text>
  <text start="114.009" dur="7.59">amount of cryptocurrency mainly Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="118.45" dur="5.85">and selling it and bringing down the</text>
  <text start="121.599" dur="5.671">price now remember they accumulated a</text>
  <text start="124.3" dur="6.299">lot of this cryptocurrency from mount</text>
  <text start="127.27" dur="6.36">cogs and they use this to basically look</text>
  <text start="130.599" dur="5.22">make cryptocurrency look volatile now</text>
  <text start="133.63" dur="4.02">let&amp;#39;s put all this together here because</text>
  <text start="135.819" dur="4.741">they were telling us as Bitcoin was</text>
  <text start="137.65" dur="6.54">going up that this is something very</text>
  <text start="140.56" dur="5.52">scary Facebook Google and many others</text>
  <text start="144.19" dur="4.89">said we&amp;#39;re not gonna allow anyone to</text>
  <text start="146.08" dur="4.379">advertise crypto currencies the central</text>
  <text start="149.08" dur="3.51">bank was out there telling you that</text>
  <text start="150.459" dur="6.061">criminals are using it terrorists are</text>
  <text start="152.59" dur="5.91">using it it&amp;#39;s absolutely awful and all</text>
  <text start="156.52" dur="4.02">of a sudden weeks we saw crypto</text>
  <text start="158.5" dur="3.54">currencies become very very volatile and</text>
  <text start="160.54" dur="2.809">they went up and they went down they</text>
  <text start="162.04" dur="4.89">went up when they went down and</text>
  <text start="163.349" dur="5.981">basically mission accomplished they made</text>
  <text start="166.93" dur="4.919">everyone feel that Oh crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="169.33" dur="6.39">this is too volatile it&amp;#39;s dangerous you</text>
  <text start="171.849" dur="6.811">shouldn&amp;#39;t be in it now we see since that</text>
  <text start="175.72" dur="5.4">whole entire episode is over the same</text>
  <text start="178.66" dur="5.16">exact companies are saying now that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="181.12" dur="4.23">ok to advertise crypto currencies they</text>
  <text start="183.82" dur="3.21">still have a ban on icos</text>
  <text start="185.35" dur="4.17">but crypto currencies like</text>
  <text start="187.03" dur="5.7">Facebook right now is saying that they</text>
  <text start="189.52" dur="5.13">will allow people to advertise and of</text>
  <text start="192.73" dur="5.01">course they work they rework their terms</text>
  <text start="194.65" dur="4.5">of service and you know they&amp;#39;ve that</text>
  <text start="197.74" dur="3.03">they&amp;#39;re letting people and warning</text>
  <text start="199.15" dur="3.54">people that these are dangerous of</text>
  <text start="200.77" dur="3.84">course they allow gambling on there and</text>
  <text start="202.69" dur="4.19">that&amp;#39;s not dangerous but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="204.61" dur="6.3">seeing right now is a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="206.88" dur="7.45">manipulation of this market and they put</text>
  <text start="210.91" dur="5.43">fear into almost everyone and this is</text>
  <text start="214.33" dur="5.73">what they wanted to do because this is</text>
  <text start="216.34" dur="5.64">how they move everyone away from maybe</text>
  <text start="220.06" dur="4.8">another currency another asset that</text>
  <text start="221.98" dur="6.33">would go up against the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="306.07" dur="6.75">economy continually break down right now</text>
  <text start="309.97" dur="6.629">we&amp;#39;re seeing core durable goods they are</text>
  <text start="312.82" dur="6.719">declining right now now once again we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="316.599" dur="4.001">seen this two times now this is the</text>
  <text start="319.539" dur="3.731">second month in</text>
  <text start="320.6" dur="4.29">rrrow that core durable goods have</text>
  <text start="323.27" dur="4.94">slumped and this is you know you washer</text>
  <text start="324.89" dur="6.51">your dryers the big-ticket items and</text>
  <text start="328.21" dur="5.35">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is these big-ticket</text>
  <text start="331.4" dur="3.84">items where you&amp;#39;re normally not taking</text>
  <text start="333.56" dur="3.54">out a loan to purchases yes they have</text>
  <text start="335.24" dur="3.33">finance plans and things like that but</text>
  <text start="337.1" dur="3.69">normally you&amp;#39;re just paying cash for</text>
  <text start="338.57" dur="4.56">these people are not going out and</text>
  <text start="340.79" dur="2.97">purchasing these big-ticket items</text>
  <text start="343.13" dur="3.27">anymore</text>
  <text start="343.76" dur="4.38">and there&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re slowing up because</text>
  <text start="346.4" dur="2.91">they realize they need to hold on to</text>
  <text start="348.14" dur="2.64">their funds and they really don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="349.31" dur="3.44">to put this on their credit card they</text>
  <text start="350.78" dur="4.98">don&amp;#39;t want to take another loan out and</text>
  <text start="352.75" dur="4.39">we see that this is starting to slow up</text>
  <text start="355.76" dur="4.26">right now if we look at the housing</text>
  <text start="357.14" dur="5">market what do we see well we know that</text>
  <text start="360.02" dur="5.82">new home sales they were revised and</text>
  <text start="362.14" dur="6.58">every other place was declining except</text>
  <text start="365.84" dur="6.24">for the south we saw existing homes</text>
  <text start="368.72" dur="7.47">declining and now we see pending homes</text>
  <text start="372.08" dur="7.35">declining so we&amp;#39;re starting to see that</text>
  <text start="376.19" dur="5.13">the housing market is in a downward</text>
  <text start="379.43" dur="3.78">trajectory what else do we see happening</text>
  <text start="381.32" dur="3.3">in the housing market prices are</text>
  <text start="383.21" dur="2.58">starting to come down you know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="384.62" dur="3.6">going to happen when prices come down</text>
  <text start="385.79" dur="3.69">people get nervous traffic&amp;#39;s gonna dry</text>
  <text start="388.22" dur="2.4">up people are gonna say you know</text>
  <text start="389.48" dur="4.7">something I&amp;#39;m not gonna sell my house</text>
  <text start="390.62" dur="5.94">right now this is how it all begins and</text>
  <text start="394.18" dur="6.1">we need to remember something very</text>
  <text start="396.56" dur="8.85">important about pending home sales they</text>
  <text start="400.28" dur="7.32">are an indicator on what the housing</text>
  <text start="405.41" dur="5.64">market is going to do it&amp;#39;s a sales</text>
  <text start="407.6" dur="6.6">leading indicator because they they</text>
  <text start="411.05" dur="6.99">track the contract signings so purchases</text>
  <text start="414.2" dur="5.64">of existing homes are tabulated when a</text>
  <text start="418.04" dur="3.75">deal closes typically a month or two</text>
  <text start="419.84" dur="3.9">later and this is how they can judge</text>
  <text start="421.79" dur="3.69">what&amp;#39;s going to happen right now and</text>
  <text start="423.74" dur="6.81">when we look at us pending home sales</text>
  <text start="425.48" dur="7.2">they did reach a peak around 2015-2016</text>
  <text start="430.55" dur="6.96">and ever since then they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="432.68" dur="6.54">declining every single month and again</text>
  <text start="437.51" dur="3.84">we&amp;#39;ve seen this before this is what</text>
  <text start="439.22" dur="3.54">happened back in 2006 when everything</text>
  <text start="441.35" dur="3.87">peaked everything started to come down</text>
  <text start="442.76" dur="4.44">prices started to come down existing</text>
  <text start="445.22" dur="4.29">home sales started to come down pending</text>
  <text start="447.2" dur="5.64">home sales contract signings declined</text>
  <text start="449.51" dur="6.57">now remember this is all declining</text>
  <text start="452.84" dur="5.19">during a period when real estate is</text>
  <text start="456.08" dur="5.01">supposed to be booming this is the</text>
  <text start="458.03" dur="4.5">summer months the flowers are out people</text>
  <text start="461.09" dur="3.15">are mowing their lawn the houses are</text>
  <text start="462.53" dur="3.57">looking great it&amp;#39;s warm to go look at</text>
  <text start="464.24" dur="3.42">homes people want to get in their homes</text>
  <text start="466.1" dur="3.599">before school starts so they can move</text>
  <text start="467.66" dur="4.35">their whole entire family it&amp;#39;s easier to</text>
  <text start="469.699" dur="5.611">move when you have warm weather and</text>
  <text start="472.01" dur="5.7">guess what everything&amp;#39;s going the</text>
  <text start="475.31" dur="4.38">opposite way now on top of that as</text>
  <text start="477.71" dur="4.53">everyone knows we have interest rates</text>
  <text start="479.69" dur="4.699">moving up mortgage applications or</text>
  <text start="482.24" dur="4.47">declining reef eyes are declining and</text>
  <text start="484.389" dur="4.301">this whole thing is just gonna end in</text>
  <text start="486.71" dur="4.4">one gigantic disaster like it did back</text>
  <text start="488.69" dur="4.77">in 2008-2009</text>
  <text start="491.11" dur="6.9">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="493.46" dur="9.42">that this whole thing is one gigantic</text>
  <text start="498.01" dur="7.77">bubble now minuchin is out there and he</text>
  <text start="502.88" dur="6">is saying that the market got their</text>
  <text start="505.78" dur="4.9">messages mixed up when he came out and</text>
  <text start="508.88" dur="3.12">said that he&amp;#39;s going to be putting or</text>
  <text start="510.68" dur="4.95">trump is gonna be putting the ban on</text>
  <text start="512" dur="4.86">China&amp;#39;s investment in the US and he is</text>
  <text start="515.63" dur="3.45">out there saying that</text>
  <text start="516.86" dur="5.01">yeah the messages got mixed up he</text>
  <text start="519.08" dur="5.46">apologized saying that this is not what</text>
  <text start="521.87" dur="4.62">he really meant to say and it seems like</text>
  <text start="524.54" dur="4.44">this is the second time he&amp;#39;s doing this</text>
  <text start="526.49" dur="4.71">where these things just got mixed up and</text>
  <text start="528.98" dur="4.92">he said something that might not have</text>
  <text start="531.2" dur="5.88">been true or he wasn&amp;#39;t on the same page</text>
  <text start="533.9" dur="6.66">as everyone else which I find very</text>
  <text start="537.08" dur="6.42">interesting Lagarde is out there and she</text>
  <text start="540.56" dur="5.61">is saying the eurozone countries they</text>
  <text start="543.5" dur="6.54">must prepare for financial shocks</text>
  <text start="546.17" dur="6.12">together now I thought coming from the</text>
  <text start="550.04" dur="4.68">IMF if we go back a couple of months</text>
  <text start="552.29" dur="4.95">that the economy was doing fantastically</text>
  <text start="554.72" dur="3.989">that&amp;#39;s gonna grow tremendously I mean</text>
  <text start="557.24" dur="4.2">you know they put out their projections</text>
  <text start="558.709" dur="5.041">of course they&amp;#39;re always wrong and now</text>
  <text start="561.44" dur="4.17">she&amp;#39;s on the other end and we discussed</text>
  <text start="563.75" dur="4.14">this a little bit before where she</text>
  <text start="565.61" dur="4.8">saying that the eurozone countries they</text>
  <text start="567.89" dur="5.43">should work together to build resilience</text>
  <text start="570.41" dur="5.25">against future economic downturns now</text>
  <text start="573.32" dur="5.04">why would there be future economic</text>
  <text start="575.66" dur="4.35">downturns if they&amp;#39;re telling us the</text>
  <text start="578.36" dur="4.32">economy and all the countries are doing</text>
  <text start="580.01" dur="6.36">fantastically because they understand</text>
  <text start="582.68" dur="6.33">this is this whole thing was</text>
  <text start="586.37" dur="5.31">supposed to happen we were supposed to</text>
  <text start="589.01" dur="5.25">be in some type of an event right now</text>
  <text start="591.68" dur="4.11">where the world was going to be engulfed</text>
  <text start="594.26" dur="3.36">in some type of war something else to</text>
  <text start="595.79" dur="4.65">cover up this whole entire system</text>
  <text start="597.62" dur="5.88">breaking up and collapsing so she&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="600.44" dur="5.64">there saying that the EU countries with</text>
  <text start="603.5" dur="4.5">the euro they should have a rainy day</text>
  <text start="606.08" dur="3.24">fund and we discussed this before where</text>
  <text start="608" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re saying that all the country</text>
  <text start="609.32" dur="6.33">should you know raise taxes cut spending</text>
  <text start="612.05" dur="6.479">and put money into a rainy day fund when</text>
  <text start="615.65" dur="4.71">everything falls apart she also added</text>
  <text start="618.529" dur="4.531">that it was critical for European</text>
  <text start="620.36" dur="4.89">countries to prepare for taking on any</text>
  <text start="623.06" dur="5.1">industries that might move from Britain</text>
  <text start="625.25" dur="5.4">following the brexit so we have the</text>
  <text start="628.16" dur="4.619">brexit going on we have Italy pulling</text>
  <text start="630.65" dur="3.18">away and they&amp;#39;re very nervous about this</text>
  <text start="632.779" dur="2.851">what they&amp;#39;re really saying and what</text>
  <text start="633.83" dur="5.1">she&amp;#39;s really saying is that what they</text>
  <text start="635.63" dur="5.97">once had is breaking apart and the</text>
  <text start="638.93" dur="5.25">remaining EU countries if you want this</text>
  <text start="641.6" dur="5.4">to continue on well you&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="644.18" dur="6.27">support it somehow someway now there was</text>
  <text start="647" dur="6.3">a leaked report from a Chinese</text>
  <text start="650.45" dur="5.61">government backed think-tank which is</text>
  <text start="653.3" dur="5.85">warning of a potential financial panic</text>
  <text start="656.06" dur="6.54">in the world&amp;#39;s second largest economy</text>
  <text start="659.15" dur="5.61">which is China a sign that some members</text>

  <text start="713.57" dur="6">bank and other regulators and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="717.53" dur="2.78">saying they should even maybe contact</text>
  <text start="719.57" dur="3.53">the Polly</text>
  <text start="720.31" dur="4.86">or other government ministries to</text>
  <text start="723.1" dur="5.67">prepare to prepare for what is coming</text>
  <text start="725.17" dur="7.04">now it&amp;#39;s very interesting because when</text>
  <text start="728.77" dur="6.63">we look at Obama&amp;#39;s presidency the IMF</text>
  <text start="732.21" dur="4.63">thus the main central banks the biz they</text>
  <text start="735.4" dur="4.02">never talked about this they just told</text>
  <text start="736.84" dur="5.16">us how this recovery was do it was was</text>
  <text start="739.42" dur="4.38">fantastic that things were moving in the</text>
  <text start="742" dur="4.67">right direction everything was great</text>
  <text start="743.8" dur="4.98">then Trump came in became president and</text>
  <text start="746.67" dur="3.97">basically all of us on everything</text>
  <text start="748.78" dur="4.41">started to turn a little bit that the</text>
  <text start="750.64" dur="4.17">economy is not doing that well and of</text>
  <text start="753.19" dur="4.8">course they&amp;#39;re blaming it on the tariffs</text>
  <text start="754.81" dur="5.28">that everything is breaking apart that</text>
  <text start="757.99" dur="4.8">the EU nation should protect themselves</text>
  <text start="760.09" dur="4.53">the biz is which is the central bank of</text>
  <text start="762.79" dur="4.14">all central banks is separating</text>
  <text start="764.62" dur="4.32">themselves from the banking industry</text>
  <text start="766.93" dur="4.92">saying that yet they&amp;#39;re insolvent and</text>
  <text start="768.94" dur="6.3">we&amp;#39;re starting to hear a lot of this out</text>
  <text start="771.85" dur="5.97">there and at the same time they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="775.24" dur="5.7">telling us that the world economy is</text>
  <text start="777.82" dur="5.07">going to grow so basically what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="780.94" dur="3.93">doing right now is they&amp;#39;re letting you</text>
  <text start="782.89" dur="3.12">know that something is coming and this</text>
  <text start="784.87" dur="3.9">is what they like to do they like the</text>
  <text start="786.01" dur="4.08">Telegraph this in advance to say hey we</text>
  <text start="788.77" dur="3.09">told you that this was coming</text>
  <text start="790.09" dur="3.89">we also told you that everything was</text>
  <text start="791.86" dur="5.01">fine but we told you this was coming so</text>
  <text start="793.98" dur="4.84">we&amp;#39;re not to blame well they are to</text>
  <text start="796.87" dur="4.49">blame this is their system they created</text>
  <text start="798.82" dur="5.4">it we are under a central banking system</text>
  <text start="801.36" dur="5.46">where they spread debt to every single</text>
  <text start="804.22" dur="5.37">country but every country into debt and</text>
  <text start="806.82" dur="4.05">basically the central bank owns these</text>
  <text start="809.59" dur="3.48">countries because they can dictate</text>
  <text start="810.87" dur="5.26">anything they want to these countries</text>
  <text start="813.07" dur="5.58">they can even push them into war so</text>
  <text start="816.13" dur="5.34">right now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="818.65" dur="6.54">these central banks are very worried</text>
  <text start="821.47" dur="6.12">about this system that we&amp;#39;re in because</text>
  <text start="825.19" dur="4.23">their system is breaking down that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="827.59" dur="5.07">what they&amp;#39;re worried about and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="829.42" dur="5.25">looking to protect it in any way they</text>
  <text start="832.66" dur="4.11">possibly can now the central bank of all</text>
  <text start="834.67" dur="3.75">central banks the biz they&amp;#39;re separating</text>
  <text start="836.77" dur="4.59">themselves from all of this and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="838.42" dur="5.04">a reason for this is because they sit on</text>
  <text start="841.36" dur="4.77">the top it&amp;#39;s like the main Rothschild</text>
  <text start="843.46" dur="4.41">banking system where they oversee</text>
  <text start="846.13" dur="4.17">everything and they don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="847.87" dur="3.93">their little piddly you know branches of</text>
  <text start="850.3" dur="2.85">central banks around the world because</text>
  <text start="851.8" dur="1.89">they can be replaced in a second and</text>
  <text start="853.15" dur="2.01">they&amp;#39;ll just call it</text>
  <text start="853.69" dur="3.29">therefore name they&amp;#39;ve done this in the</text>
  <text start="855.16" dur="3.9">past even here in the United States</text>
  <text start="856.98" dur="3.96">where they where they&amp;#39;ve had many</text>
  <text start="859.06" dur="3.72">different central banks in America</text>
  <text start="860.94" dur="3.58">wasn&amp;#39;t called the Federal Reserve they</text>
  <text start="862.78" dur="3.15">were called by other names and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="864.52" dur="3.72">also had central banks in other</text>
  <text start="865.93" dur="4.02">countries so they don&amp;#39;t care about that</text>
  <text start="868.24" dur="4.71">because they understand if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="869.95" dur="5.67">intact on the very top level all they</text>
  <text start="872.95" dur="5.22">need to do at that point they say yeah</text>
  <text start="875.62" dur="4.44">those systems are corrupt you know this</text>
  <text start="878.17" dur="3.99">is why it happened they&amp;#39;ll separate</text>
  <text start="880.06" dur="5.19">themselves and then they&amp;#39;ll basically</text>
  <text start="882.16" dur="4.35">create a new system and that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="885.25" dur="2.43">what they wanted to do now they were</text>
  <text start="886.51" dur="4.23">gonna do it in a completely different</text>
  <text start="887.68" dur="5.49">way but now they have no alternative but</text>
  <text start="890.74" dur="4.68">to embrace what is happening and point</text>
  <text start="893.17" dur="3.78">the finger most likely at Trump and</text>
  <text start="895.42" dur="3.39">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="896.95" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re pointing the finger in that</text>
  <text start="898.81" dur="4.02">direction they&amp;#39;re preparing for what is</text>
  <text start="901.21" dur="3.57">coming and they know eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="902.83" dur="4.8">going to happen is the system&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="904.78" dur="5.13">be ripped apart that&amp;#39;s the whole plan is</text>
  <text start="907.63" dur="4.62">to rip the globalists the central</text>
  <text start="909.91" dur="4.56">banking system completely apart and the</text>
  <text start="912.25" dur="3.99">central banks they are warning about</text>
  <text start="914.47" dur="3.54">this right now so we are going to be</text>
  <text start="916.24" dur="3.9">going through this transition it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="918.01" dur="4.2">approaching because the warning cries</text>
  <text start="920.14" dur="3.72">are getting louder</text>
