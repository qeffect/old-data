  <text start="1002.57" dur="7.62">something he&amp;#39;s there to coordinate</text>
  <text start="1005.72" dur="7.44">something much larger and we all know</text>

  <text start="1013.16" dur="6.69">the US their backs are against the wall</text>
  <text start="1016.51" dur="7.69">we know that Russia and Syria they&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="1024.2" dur="7.259">City town after town after town the US</text>
  <text start="1028.52" dur="4.59">will not coordinate with Russia because</text>
  <text start="1031.459" dur="4.861">as we know Russia extended their hand</text>
  <text start="1033.11" dur="6.229">and say listen let&amp;#39;s join forces when we</text>
  <text start="1036.32" dur="5.67">go after the Islamic state and Rocca and</text>
  <text start="1039.339" dur="5.531">we can get the terrorist group out of</text>
  <text start="1041.99" dur="6.53">this area but the US decided to decline</text>
  <text start="1044.87" dur="6.87">this and of course this is a huge</text>
  <text start="1048.52" dur="5.83">strategic move by Russia because they</text>
  <text start="1051.74" dur="4.98">would know exactly what the US was doing</text>
  <text start="1054.35" dur="4.2">where they were bombing but of course</text>
  <text start="1056.72" dur="6.51">the US doesn&amp;#39;t want to be any part of</text>
  <text start="1058.55" dur="9.27">this so we see right now that the</text>
  <text start="1063.23" dur="6.45">situation is falling apart rapidly that</text>
  <text start="1067.82" dur="5.81">they&amp;#39;re losing a lot of territory in</text>
  <text start="1069.68" dur="8.97">Syria a senior general had to visit and</text>
  <text start="1073.63" dur="7.12">if we put all of this together turkey</text>
  <text start="1078.65" dur="4.97">got missile systems that were put on the</text>

  <text start="1083.62" dur="5.53">reinforcing the border we know that</text>
  <text start="1086.42" dur="8.25">they&amp;#39;re building bases in Syria in Iraq</text>
  <text start="1089.15" dur="8.28">in Lebanon Libya and Yemen we know that</text>
  <text start="1094.67" dur="5.4">there&amp;#39;s been many different war drills</text>
  <text start="1097.43" dur="5.46">going on in this area there&amp;#39;s one going</text>
  <text start="1100.07" dur="5.4">right now they&amp;#39;re going to leave the</text>
  <text start="1102.89" dur="6.9">equipment there they&amp;#39;re practicing a</text>
  <text start="1105.47" dur="6.45">ground invasion into Syria we see that</text>
  <text start="1109.79" dur="5.7">ships are being sailed out into edge</text>
  <text start="1111.92" dur="5.34">into the Aegean Sea of course under the</text>
  <text start="1115.49" dur="4.29">illusion that they&amp;#39;re going after the</text>
  <text start="1117.26" dur="4.74">refugees trying to keep control of all</text>
  <text start="1119.78" dur="4.44">this but we see German ships NATO ships</text>
  <text start="1122" dur="6.42">the u.s. is going to be selling their</text>
  <text start="1124.22" dur="9.93">ships over all of this is being planned</text>
  <text start="1128.42" dur="8.64">and readied for August now irda one is</text>
  <text start="1134.15" dur="6.92">very angry because it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1137.06" dur="7.08">going to postpone the visa-free travel</text>
  <text start="1141.07" dur="5.2">to Turkey was supposed to have in July</text>
  <text start="1144.14" dur="5.31">first and it looks like it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="1146.27" dur="6.33">delayed because right now the EU</text>
  <text start="1149.45" dur="5.52">believes that turkey is not ready for</text>
  <text start="1152.6" dur="4.38">this now of course her Dhawan is going</text>
  <text start="1154.97" dur="4.02">to throw a fit he&amp;#39;s probably going to</text>
  <text start="1156.98" dur="4.77">release the refugees into the entire</text>
  <text start="1158.99" dur="6.63">area unless the EU gives more money to</text>
  <text start="1161.75" dur="7.23">him but this kind of looks planned if</text>
  <text start="1165.62" dur="5.61">you really look at it because Turkey has</text>
  <text start="1168.98" dur="5.78">been working on something much larger</text>
  <text start="1171.23" dur="7.29">they&amp;#39;ve been working on their safe zone</text>
  <text start="1174.76" dur="7.63">now Turkey has mobilized its ground</text>
  <text start="1178.52" dur="7.35">forces right up to their border because</text>
  <text start="1182.39" dur="5.19">their plan is to create a safe zone now</text>
  <text start="1185.87" dur="4.77">we know they use the propaganda that</text>
  <text start="1187.58" dur="6.03">Assad was hitting the refugees in the</text>
  <text start="1190.64" dur="5.61">northern part of Syria and we can see</text>
  <text start="1193.61" dur="4.08">right now turkey wants to establish the</text>
  <text start="1196.25" dur="3.39">safe zone now of course the US is saying</text>
  <text start="1197.69" dur="3.9">no no no this is not going to work we</text>
  <text start="1199.64" dur="4.86">don&amp;#39;t want this but in the background</text>
  <text start="1201.59" dur="4.2">behind all of this is this is exactly</text>
  <text start="1204.5" dur="3.9">what they want because it will make it</text>
  <text start="1205.79" dur="5.04">easier to have elite forces ground</text>
  <text start="1208.4" dur="8.55">forces move in and out between Turkey</text>
  <text start="1210.83" dur="8.22">and Syria and we see right now that they</text>
  <text start="1216.95" dur="4.62">can plant their soldiers in this area</text>
  <text start="1219.05" dur="4.26">because these are all refugees you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1221.57" dur="6.99">not going to bomb the refugee areas and</text>
  <text start="1223.31" dur="6.93">it acts as some type of cover so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1228.56" dur="3.24">going to have to continually watch this</text>
  <text start="1230.24" dur="3.57">because we see things that are building</text>
  <text start="1231.8" dur="5.34">up getting ready and prepare</text>
  <text start="1233.81" dur="6.36">for something much much larger than what</text>
  <text start="1237.14" dur="6">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and when we</text>
  <text start="1240.17" dur="5.37">continually add up all these indicators</text>
  <text start="1243.14" dur="5.91">we see that yes something is building</text>
  <text start="1245.54" dur="5.19">something is growing here and most</text>
  <text start="1249.05" dur="5.82">likely it&amp;#39;s going to be this major</text>
  <text start="1250.73" dur="6.99">ground offensive in August now to</text>
  <text start="1254.87" dur="4.29">continually move the agenda along the US</text>
  <text start="1257.72" dur="3.15">government central bankers and the rest</text>
  <text start="1259.16" dur="3.12">of the coalition forces they have to</text>
  <text start="1260.87" dur="4.38">make it seem like the terrorists are</text>
  <text start="1262.28" dur="5.64">coming to get us so they every so often</text>
  <text start="1265.25" dur="6.12">they say okay let&amp;#39;s have one of these</text>
  <text start="1267.92" dur="6.36">individuals come out and say yes we need</text>

  <text start="1274.28" dur="5.55">to attack Europe we need to attack</text>
  <text start="1276.58" dur="6.16">everywhere now this is happening once</text>
  <text start="1279.83" dur="5.58">again now of course this is the strike</text>
