  <text start="193.5" dur="5.62">Trump most likely will start to tweet</text>
  <text start="196.66" dur="4.26">out that the Fed needs to cut rates why</text>
  <text start="199.12" dur="4.35">because when we start to look at the</text>
  <text start="200.92" dur="5.16">housing market it is a complete and</text>
  <text start="203.47" dur="3.59">utter disaster Case Shiller came out and</text>
  <text start="206.08" dur="4.32">you know they look at the twenty</text>
  <text start="207.06" dur="5.68">metropolitan regions and they track the</text>
  <text start="210.4" dur="5.15">prices of homes guess what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="212.74" dur="6.87">well the prices are starting to fall</text>
  <text start="215.55" dur="5.74">that&amp;#39;s not all the starts and permits</text>
  <text start="219.61" dur="5.16">data that is a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="221.29" dur="6.38">disaster and the mortgage applications</text>
  <text start="224.77" dur="6.689">that is a complete and utter disaster</text>
  <text start="227.67" dur="7.96">we&amp;#39;ve reached a point where even keeping</text>
  <text start="231.459" dur="6.451">the the Fed rate where it is it is not</text>
  <text start="235.63" dur="3.9">going to help now remember what the deep</text>
  <text start="237.91" dur="3.69">state the central banks were planning</text>
  <text start="239.53" dur="3.87">they were planning to raise the rates</text>
  <text start="241.6" dur="3.84">and raise the rates and bring the</text>
  <text start="243.4" dur="6.809">economy down this is what they did in</text>
  <text start="245.44" dur="7.14">2016 2017 2018 and Trump stopped it in</text>
  <text start="250.209" dur="4.891">2019 where he continually said listen</text>
  <text start="252.58" dur="3.87">every time you do something the economy</text>
  <text start="255.1" dur="3.27">falls apart look at the stock market</text>
  <text start="256.45" dur="4.77">look at the stock market you just raise</text>
  <text start="258.37" dur="4.65">rates the stock market came down he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.22" dur="4.08">going to do the same thing again the</text>
  <text start="263.02" dur="4.59">markets coming down he&amp;#39;s going to tweet</text>
  <text start="265.3" dur="4.38">out who the Fed needs to do something</text>
  <text start="267.61" dur="4.74">maybe they should cut rates because</text>
  <text start="269.68" dur="6.239">their policy is not working right now</text>
  <text start="272.35" dur="7.05">I&amp;#39;m making be the economy look great</text>
  <text start="275.919" dur="6.151">look at all the other numbers and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="279.4" dur="5.22">gonna start tweeting out once again that</text>
  <text start="282.07" dur="4.5">the Fed needs to cut rates and what is</text>
  <text start="284.62" dur="4.95">this going to do well the Fed is gonna</text>
  <text start="286.57" dur="5.31">have to cut rates and once they do the</text>
  <text start="289.57" dur="3.69">housing market will start to pick up</text>
  <text start="291.88" dur="3.63">again because what does this do when it</text>
  <text start="293.26" dur="3.55">cuts rates the mortgage rate comes down</text>
  <text start="295.51" dur="3.49">which means more</text>
  <text start="296.81" dur="4.89">people come into the market more people</text>
  <text start="299" dur="5.85">can afford homes when the rates go up it</text>
  <text start="301.7" dur="5.46">pushes people out of the market and this</text>
  <text start="304.85" dur="4.56">is why this needs to happen the bubbles</text>
  <text start="307.16" dur="3.9">right now they&amp;#39;re deflating and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="309.41" dur="3.99">happening very quickly we see it in Las</text>
  <text start="311.06" dur="4.38">Vegas Denver Portland Seattle San</text>

  <text start="318.59" dur="3.06">games people are starting to lose money</text>
  <text start="320.57" dur="3">and when people lose money in the</text>
  <text start="321.65" dur="5.16">housing market guess what they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="323.57" dur="5.64">feel comfortable and we also see that</text>
  <text start="326.81" dur="5.49">the mortgage applications they have also</text>
  <text start="329.21" dur="3.769">plunged why because the rates are too</text>
  <text start="332.3" dur="3.45">high</text>
