  <text start="53.18" dur="6.56">hi and welcome you listening to the x-22</text>
  <text start="57.05" dur="5.52">report my name is dave in this episode</text>
  <text start="59.74" dur="5.56">1507 a and today&amp;#39;s date is February 26</text>
  <text start="62.57" dur="5.09">2018 and the top of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.3" dur="6.57">economic indicators are being triggered</text>
  <text start="67.66" dur="5.98">signaling a major bear market let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="71.87" dur="4.08">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="73.64" dur="4.05">news now over the many many reports we</text>
  <text start="75.95" dur="3.96">talk about manipulation on how they</text>
  <text start="77.69" dur="4.47">manipulate the statistics to make us</text>
  <text start="79.91" dur="4.08">believe that everything is fantastic</text>
  <text start="82.16" dur="2.85">like the unemployment numbers where</text>
  <text start="83.99" dur="3.239">they&amp;#39;re saying that the unemployment</text>
  <text start="85.01" dur="4.38">numbers are around you know four or four</text>
  <text start="87.229" dur="5.221">point one percent around that range and</text>
  <text start="89.39" dur="6.06">we&amp;#39;re at full employment right now and</text>
  <text start="92.45" dur="4.86">over the many many years since the 2008</text>
  <text start="95.45" dur="3.96">financial crisis and even before that</text>
  <text start="97.31" dur="5.61">they have been manipulating the</text>
  <text start="99.41" dur="5.7">unemployment numbers and basically not</text>
  <text start="102.92" dur="5.46">counting those individuals they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="105.11" dur="5.31">find a job and of course they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="108.38" dur="4.08">that that&amp;#39;s not true but it&amp;#39;s turning</text>
  <text start="110.42" dur="4.77">out and this is coming from a Fed report</text>
  <text start="112.46" dur="7.409">saying that listen most of the</text>
  <text start="115.19" dur="8.19">working-age men will never return to the</text>
  <text start="119.869" dur="6.721">labor force those individuals that</text>
  <text start="123.38" dur="5.549">haven&amp;#39;t found jobs well they&amp;#39;re pretty</text>
  <text start="126.59" dur="5.399">much out of luck and we can see that</text>
  <text start="128.929" dur="6.391">this trend has accelerated over time</text>
  <text start="131.989" dur="6.78">where they said the middle class was</text>
  <text start="135.32" dur="6.449">being lost and it has been lost now the</text>
  <text start="138.769" dur="5.851">labor force participation rate for prime</text>
  <text start="141.769" dur="5.19">aged men 25 to 54 has declined</text>
  <text start="144.62" dur="5.7">dramatically in the u.s. since the 60s</text>
  <text start="146.959" dur="6">but in the last couple of years it is</text>
  <text start="150.32" dur="6.12">accelerated and it has intensified and</text>
  <text start="152.959" dur="5.131">we could see right now in 1996 there</text>
  <text start="156.44" dur="3.6">were four point six million prime aged</text>
  <text start="158.09" dur="6.45">men did not participate in the labor</text>
  <text start="160.04" dur="7.41">force by 2016 this number is now at 7.1</text>
  <text start="164.54" dur="4.71">million and continually rising and if</text>
  <text start="167.45" dur="4.5">you look at this you could see that the</text>
  <text start="169.25" dur="4.89">entire middle class has been wiped out</text>
  <text start="171.95" dur="5.37">completely and what they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="174.14" dur="5.31">that these jobs well they&amp;#39;re not coming</text>
  <text start="177.32" dur="4.41">back once they&amp;#39;re lost most of them</text>
  <text start="179.45" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re not going to see a return of</text>
  <text start="181.73" dur="5.19">these type of jobs and we see at this</text>
  <text start="184.88" dur="3.87">point this is why they wanted</text>
  <text start="186.92" dur="4.8">illegals coming into this country</text>
  <text start="188.75" dur="4.319">because they realized the only jobs in</text>
  <text start="191.72" dur="3.629">this country and they were setting it up</text>
  <text start="193.069" dur="6.03">and getting prepared for a third-world</text>
  <text start="195.349" dur="6.75">nation that was their entire plan now</text>
  <text start="199.099" dur="5.61">what we need to do is we need to start</text>
  <text start="202.099" dur="4.681">creating some of these jobs how do we do</text>
  <text start="204.709" dur="5.551">this well the Fed can&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="206.78" dur="7.22">we just can&amp;#39;t create currency and create</text>
  <text start="210.26" dur="6.839">jobs we have to bring some form of</text>
  <text start="214" dur="4.48">manufacturing some type of production</text>
  <text start="217.099" dur="4.291">back to this country</text>
  <text start="218.48" dur="7.47">that is the only way we need to increase</text>
  <text start="221.39" dur="8.55">trade trade items that we produce here</text>
  <text start="225.95" dur="6.63">in this country and we can see this is</text>
  <text start="229.94" dur="5.01">the path that we&amp;#39;re on right now but it</text>
  <text start="232.58" dur="4.26">is a long path and there are other</text>
  <text start="234.95" dur="4.71">forces that are stopping this from</text>
  <text start="236.84" dur="6.29">happening at the same time this is all</text>
  <text start="239.66" dur="6.15">happening we see that there are</text>
  <text start="243.13" dur="5.169">different indicators all around us</text>
  <text start="245.81" dur="4.649">showing us that there are signs that</text>
  <text start="248.299" dur="4.741">this economy is not doing well at all</text>
  <text start="250.459" dur="4.891">and it&amp;#39;s deteriorating very very quickly</text>
  <text start="253.04" dur="5.1">and we know that the housing market</text>
  <text start="255.35" dur="5.46">right now well it is not doing well at</text>
  <text start="258.14" dur="5.25">all the housing market is doing terribly</text>
  <text start="260.81" dur="5.609">yes they have the 20 cities yes they can</text>
  <text start="263.39" dur="5.22">blow up the bubbles we know that Fannie</text>
  <text start="266.419" dur="4.981">and Freddie they&amp;#39;re asking for a bailout</text>
  <text start="268.61" dur="4.35">already and the whole thing is a</text>
  <text start="271.4" dur="4.41">complete mess actually</text>
  <text start="272.96" dur="5.13">we&amp;#39;re back to where we were prior to</text>
  <text start="275.81" dur="5.07">2008 there&amp;#39;s really no difference the</text>
  <text start="278.09" dur="5.04">big difference is is that they created</text>
  <text start="280.88" dur="4.56">the situation to be even worse than it</text>
  <text start="283.13" dur="4.23">was back in 2008 of course they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="285.44" dur="3.87">acknowledging this yet but eventually</text>
  <text start="287.36" dur="4.08">what will happen is that all this</text>
  <text start="289.31" dur="4.05">information will come out eventually and</text>
  <text start="291.44" dur="3.93">people will be looking at it just like</text>
  <text start="293.36" dur="4.13">they did in 2008 when everyone believed</text>
  <text start="295.37" dur="4.32">that the real estate market was</text>
  <text start="297.49" dur="3.85">continually move up and everything was</text>
  <text start="299.69" dur="3.81">going to be great the subprime</text>
  <text start="301.34" dur="4.17">securities were triple-a everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="303.5" dur="5.37">going to be looking back at all of this</text>
  <text start="305.51" dur="4.89">saying how did we get here and of course</text>
  <text start="308.87" dur="4.46">we&amp;#39;ve been mapping this we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="310.4" dur="5.25">watching it and we can see and we know</text>
  <text start="313.33" dur="4.89">exactly how we got here because the</text>
  <text start="315.65" dur="4.919">whole thing has been one gigantic</text>
  <text start="318.22" dur="5.559">illusion now Fannie and Fred</text>
  <text start="320.569" dur="5.25">they guarantee around four trillion in</text>
  <text start="323.779" dur="4.7">residential mortgages accounting for</text>
  <text start="325.819" dur="5.94">some forty percent of the US market and</text>
  <text start="328.479" dur="5.14">Fannie and Freddie today they are broke</text>
  <text start="331.759" dur="5.791">remember back during the financial</text>
  <text start="333.619" dur="5.431">crisis they were bailed out at the tune</text>
  <text start="337.55" dur="3.449">of about a hundred and eighty seven</text>
  <text start="339.05" dur="4.649">billion dollars from the taxpayers</text>
  <text start="340.999" dur="5.581">they were nationalized at this point the</text>
  <text start="343.699" dur="5.131">Senate tried to replace these two</text>
  <text start="346.58" dur="5.25">because they knew that this whole thing</text>
  <text start="348.83" dur="4.829">was ridiculous nothing was solved but</text>
  <text start="351.83" dur="3.539">that failed that plan completely failed</text>
  <text start="353.659" dur="4.35">and they kept them in place and now</text>
  <text start="355.369" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;re completely broke they need</text>
  <text start="358.009" dur="7.83">another bailout the housing industry is</text>
  <text start="361.399" dur="8.76">a house of cards waiting to come down</text>
  <text start="365.839" dur="6.06">and the entire financial system is based</text>
  <text start="370.159" dur="3.51">upon this because once the housing</text>
  <text start="371.899" dur="3.12">market comes down there are so many</text>
  <text start="373.669" dur="3.48">things that are interconnected with the</text>
  <text start="375.019" dur="4.68">housing market especially the everyday</text>
  <text start="377.149" dur="5.13">person when the housing market is</text>
  <text start="379.699" dur="4.47">increasing in value people have</text>
  <text start="382.279" dur="3.78">confidence they feel good about it they</text>
  <text start="384.169" dur="3.93">say you know something my house is now</text>
  <text start="386.059" dur="3.72">worth you know three hundred thousand or</text>
  <text start="388.099" dur="4.05">five hundred thousand or seven hundred</text>
  <text start="389.779" dur="4.11">thousand even though it&amp;#39;s on paper and</text>
  <text start="392.149" dur="4.651">the only way you can collect is by</text>
  <text start="393.889" dur="4.74">selling your home or taking or taking</text>
  <text start="396.8" dur="3.599">out a home equity line of credit but</text>
  <text start="398.629" dur="5.49">that&amp;#39;s not really your money you have to</text>
  <text start="400.399" dur="6.27">pay it back so people have this false</text>
  <text start="404.119" dur="5.91">sense of security when the housing</text>
  <text start="406.669" dur="6.12">market comes down that sense of security</text>
  <text start="410.029" dur="4.771">completely disappears and what that</text>
  <text start="412.789" dur="3.451">means is people don&amp;#39;t go out and say hey</text>
  <text start="414.8" dur="5.279">I&amp;#39;m gonna spend money because my house</text>
  <text start="416.24" dur="6.209">has gone up in value they kind of keep</text>
  <text start="420.079" dur="3.84">all their funds they don&amp;#39;t like to spend</text>
  <text start="422.449" dur="4.411">anything they get very nervous and</text>
  <text start="423.919" dur="5.071">afraid and that hurts retail that hurt</text>
  <text start="426.86" dur="3.719">the restaurant industry that hurts</text>
  <text start="428.99" dur="3.029">everything and then all of a sudden what</text>
  <text start="430.579" dur="3.33">happens is people see the housing prices</text>
  <text start="432.019" dur="3.841">coming down they don&amp;#39;t want to purchase</text>
  <text start="433.909" dur="5.28">homes that hurts the lumber industry</text>
  <text start="435.86" dur="7.799">that hurts the electricians the plumbers</text>
  <text start="439.189" dur="6.63">the construction workers you name it it</text>
  <text start="443.659" dur="5.22">affects almost everything this is why</text>
  <text start="445.819" dur="4.861">the Fed understands or realizes they</text>
  <text start="448.879" dur="4.68">need to continually pump up the bubble</text>
  <text start="450.68" dur="3.79">to make it look like housing is doing a</text>
  <text start="453.559" dur="2.771">lot better than a real</text>
  <text start="454.47" dur="3.9">and this is what they did prior to 2008</text>
  <text start="456.33" dur="2.82">until that until the whole thing started</text>
  <text start="458.37" dur="2.67">to fall apart</text>
  <text start="459.15" dur="3.84">this is what they&amp;#39;ve been doing to 20</text>
  <text start="461.04" dur="3.42">cities that they keep reporting on</text>
  <text start="462.99" dur="3.39">saying that the housing prices are going</text>
  <text start="464.46" dur="3.87">up because once you hear that you feel</text>
  <text start="466.38" dur="4.08">really good about it but outside the 20</text>
  <text start="468.33" dur="3.87">cities a lot of people well up they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="470.46" dur="3.96">having a very difficult difficult time</text>
  <text start="472.2" dur="3.72">selling their homes or getting the price</text>
  <text start="474.42" dur="3.57">that they want they&amp;#39;re lowering the</text>
  <text start="475.92" dur="5.03">prices and we could see right now that</text>
  <text start="477.99" dur="6.15">the housing market is not doing well as</text>
  <text start="480.95" dur="5.1">as everyone thinks it is we see existing</text>
  <text start="484.14" dur="5.1">home sales new construction all</text>
  <text start="486.05" dur="6.66">declining right now we also see that</text>
  <text start="489.24" dur="7.38">Bank of America is out there and saying</text>
  <text start="492.71" dur="7.09">listen 13 of the 19 bear market</text>
  <text start="496.62" dur="6.72">indicators have been triggered now let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="499.8" dur="6.21">go back a month ago just as the SP hit</text>
  <text start="503.34" dur="4.77">all-time high Bank of America caused a</text>
  <text start="506.01" dur="3.96">stir when it announced that one of its</text>
  <text start="508.11" dur="4.049">proprietary guaranteed bear market</text>
  <text start="509.97" dur="5.85">indicators created by the Bank of</text>
  <text start="512.159" dur="6.51">America Kwan&amp;#39;s was just triggered and we</text>
  <text start="515.82" dur="6.48">can see that once they came out with</text>
  <text start="518.669" dur="6.421">this all of a sudden we saw a drop in</text>
  <text start="522.3" dur="5.04">the market and it was pretty darn</text>
  <text start="525.09" dur="4.44">accurate it was correct on eleven out of</text>
  <text start="527.34" dur="4.44">the 11 previous occasions that it was</text>
  <text start="529.53" dur="3.51">triggered that something was going to</text>
  <text start="531.78" dur="3.63">happen there was going to be some type</text>
  <text start="533.04" dur="6.6">of Correction and there actually was</text>
  <text start="535.41" dur="6.18">fast forward to today guess what well</text>
  <text start="539.64" dur="4.94">they&amp;#39;re saying that their crash</text>
  <text start="541.59" dur="6.06">indicator was triggered once again and</text>
  <text start="544.58" dur="7.57">they&amp;#39;re saying that we are much closer</text>
  <text start="547.65" dur="7.26">to a major disaster another two</text>
  <text start="552.15" dur="6.21">indicators have been triggered meeting</text>
  <text start="554.91" dur="6.24">that no less than 13 of the 19 bear</text>
  <text start="558.36" dur="6.33">market signposts are now flashing red</text>
  <text start="561.15" dur="6.6">and this tells us that were headed</text>
  <text start="564.69" dur="6.06">towards something really really big and</text>
  <text start="567.75" dur="7.89">they&amp;#39;re saying that this might occur in</text>
  <text start="570.75" dur="7.08">the March time frame so we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="575.64" dur="4.65">watch this very carefully because when</text>
  <text start="577.83" dur="6.77">we look back in time we can see that</text>
  <text start="580.29" dur="6.96">every time there was a trigger of their</text>
  <text start="584.6" dur="3.7">signal that tells you that there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="587.25" dur="3.36">to be a bear market</text>
  <text start="588.3" dur="5.34">all of a sudden the market came down and</text>
  <text start="590.61" dur="7.8">it looks like we have hit that once</text>
  <text start="593.64" dur="8.31">again and like I said once this start to</text>
  <text start="598.41" dur="4.83">come down yes the central bank&amp;#39;s yes the</text>
  <text start="601.95" dur="3.42">plunge Protection Team yes the</text>
  <text start="603.24" dur="3.84">high-frequency traders they will do</text>
  <text start="605.37" dur="5.43">whatever they have to to keep the market</text>
  <text start="607.08" dur="6.18">up but if there&amp;#39;s a lot of individuals</text>
  <text start="610.8" dur="4.95">in there selling and there&amp;#39;s other black</text>
  <text start="613.26" dur="4.26">swans and other things that occur guess</text>
  <text start="615.75" dur="4.23">what the whole thing comes tumbling down</text>
  <text start="617.52" dur="5.22">and they will not be able to stop at</text>
  <text start="619.98" dur="6.26">this time they will try but it will</text>
  <text start="622.74" dur="7.77">continually fall and fall and fall and</text>
  <text start="626.24" dur="6.96">once that happens other things are going</text>
  <text start="630.51" dur="5.31">to occur just like it did back in 2008</text>
  <text start="633.2" dur="4.87">we&amp;#39;re gonna see corporations saying you</text>
  <text start="635.82" dur="3.99">know something we can lay off now you</text>
  <text start="638.07" dur="4.41">know something we&amp;#39;re gonna have to cut</text>
  <text start="639.81" dur="4.86">costs and everything is going to be a</text>
  <text start="642.48" dur="5.07">domino effect now we do have this battle</text>
  <text start="644.67" dur="6.66">going on between the central bank which</text>
  <text start="647.55" dur="6.39">right now they want the system down they</text>
  <text start="651.33" dur="6.15">want to place more pressure on Trump as</text>
  <text start="653.94" dur="5.91">you can see they have their event moving</text>
  <text start="657.48" dur="4.83">forward they&amp;#39;re still trying to push the</text>
  <text start="659.85" dur="5.88">narrative they&amp;#39;re keeping the new cycle</text>
  <text start="662.31" dur="5.55">busy with what is going on if they can</text>
  <text start="665.73" dur="5.25">bring down the economy that would add to</text>
  <text start="667.86" dur="4.59">it and we can see right now this is what</text>
  <text start="670.98" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re trying to do they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="672.45" dur="3.9">push us as hard as they possibly can now</text>
  <text start="674.52" dur="3.54">it&amp;#39;s very interesting we know that</text>
  <text start="676.35" dur="3.99">Puerto Rico is having a very difficult</text>
  <text start="678.06" dur="3.75">time and the president of the Federal</text>
  <text start="680.34" dur="4.2">Reserve Bank of New York William C</text>
  <text start="681.81" dur="5.16">Dudley held a press conference to</text>
  <text start="684.54" dur="5.07">effectively tell Puerto Ricans to suck</text>
  <text start="686.97" dur="4.83">it up as they attempt to recover from</text>
  <text start="689.61" dur="6.48">the humanitarian crisis caused by the</text>
  <text start="691.8" dur="6.06">hurricane Maria which devastated the</text>
  <text start="696.09" dur="4.65">infrastructure and wiped out electricity</text>
  <text start="697.86" dur="4.32">and everything else and we could see</text>
  <text start="700.74" dur="5.61">right now that they really don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="702.18" dur="8.58">about what happens there as long as they</text>
  <text start="706.35" dur="7.74">get paid on their debt and we see right</text>
  <text start="710.76" dur="6.09">now this is a good example of how the</text>
  <text start="714.09" dur="6.09">Federal Reserve will react when there</text>
  <text start="716.85" dur="4.7">are problems in the country their first</text>
  <text start="720.18" dur="4.04">order of business</text>
  <text start="721.55" dur="5.99">is to make sure they can get repayment</text>
  <text start="724.22" dur="5.16">of their debt or their interest payments</text>
  <text start="727.54" dur="4.87">everything else they could care less</text>
  <text start="729.38" dur="4.92">they could care less about anything else</text>
  <text start="732.41" dur="5.01">that happens in this country because</text>
  <text start="734.3" dur="6.36">remember central bankers they have no</text>
  <text start="737.42" dur="6.63">allegiance to a people a group a country</text>
  <text start="740.66" dur="5.97">the allegiance is to themselves and we</text>
  <text start="744.05" dur="4.8">could see this with Puerto Rico I mean</text>
  <text start="746.63" dur="2.94">they haven&amp;#39;t even recovered from the</text>
  <text start="748.85" dur="2.87">hurricane</text>
  <text start="749.57" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re still struggling down there and</text>
  <text start="751.72" dur="5.59">they&amp;#39;re just worried about getting their</text>
  <text start="754.79" dur="6.71">payments on the debt now remember</text>
  <text start="757.31" dur="7.92">central bankers they will not bankrupt a</text>
  <text start="761.5" dur="5.709">country or a province or state or</text>
  <text start="765.23" dur="5.88">anything like that they will make sure</text>
  <text start="767.209" dur="6">they keep it in limbo where they can</text>
  <text start="771.11" dur="4.229">barely get by but they can still make</text>
  <text start="773.209" dur="4.711">their interest payments but they have to</text>
  <text start="775.339" dur="5.551">push austerity that&amp;#39;s where they like</text>
  <text start="777.92" dur="6.419">these countries these states these</text>
  <text start="780.89" dur="6.15">provinces these areas because if they go</text>
  <text start="784.339" dur="4.861">under then all eyes are on the central</text>
  <text start="787.04" dur="6.39">bank saying look what you&amp;#39;ve done here</text>
  <text start="789.2" dur="6.78">you destroyed the country you destroyed</text>
  <text start="793.43" dur="4.62">this area they don&amp;#39;t want that to happen</text>
  <text start="795.98" dur="3.84">and that doesn&amp;#39;t benefit them in any way</text>
  <text start="798.05" dur="3.36">because what they like to do is keep</text>
  <text start="799.82" dur="3.63">them operational having the interest</text>
  <text start="801.41" dur="7.02">payments come in and it allows them to</text>
  <text start="803.45" dur="7.829">buy their real assets using pennies on</text>
  <text start="808.43" dur="4.8">the dollar that&amp;#39;s their whole strategy</text>
  <text start="811.279" dur="4.37">that&amp;#39;s their strategy from the beginning</text>
  <text start="813.23" dur="5.16">of time and it allows them to control</text>
  <text start="815.649" dur="6.461">the country it allows them to control</text>
  <text start="818.39" dur="6.54">the area control what is going on there</text>
  <text start="822.11" dur="5.789">and we can see right now that the</text>
  <text start="824.93" dur="5.13">central bankers it looks like they&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="827.899" dur="4.8">the point where they&amp;#39;re trying to bring</text>
  <text start="830.06" dur="5.19">the system down they want the system</text>
  <text start="832.699" dur="4.83">down they want it crashed they want it</text>
  <text start="835.25" dur="6.029">moved but they need to make sure they</text>
  <text start="837.529" dur="5.701">have the blame where it needs to go and</text>
  <text start="841.279" dur="3.511">that&amp;#39;s off of them and on to someplace</text>
  <text start="843.23" dur="3.87">else the other thing that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="844.79" dur="4.5">worried about is the crypto market and</text>
  <text start="847.1" dur="4.47">for those people that are writing in and</text>
  <text start="849.29" dur="4.62">asking me questions about the crypto</text>
  <text start="851.57" dur="3.91">market again I am NOT an expert in</text>
  <text start="853.91" dur="4.06">crypto currency yes I do</text>
  <text start="855.48" dur="4.83">you have cryptocurrencies and I can tell</text>
  <text start="857.97" dur="6.239">you what I do and I have no connection</text>
  <text start="860.31" dur="4.98">to any of this so what I do is I use an</text>
  <text start="864.209" dur="3.721">offline wallet</text>
  <text start="865.29" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s called Exodus IO so if you go onto</text>
  <text start="867.93" dur="5.58">your browser and you type in Exodus IO</text>
  <text start="870.54" dur="4.53">you&amp;#39;ll see this offline wallet which</text>

  <text start="929.069" dur="4.411">cryptocurrency into PayPal and then you</text>
  <text start="931.47" dur="3.359">can take it from PayPal and dump it into</text>
  <text start="933.48" dur="4.44">your account I believe they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="934.829" dur="4.44">rid of PayPal and they&amp;#39;re gonna only</text>

  <text start="943.29" dur="4.529">things like that you purchase any of</text>
  <text start="946.56" dur="3.54">these things you would have to go</text>
  <text start="947.819" dur="5.181">through like coinbase for instance you</text>
  <text start="950.1" dur="6.77">would have to take your dollars and</text>

  <text start="1000.68" dur="3.99">what I do this is I have no connection</text>
  <text start="1002.54" dur="5.73">to this whatsoever I&amp;#39;ve been using it it</text>
  <text start="1004.67" dur="6.69">works very very well and I haven&amp;#39;t had</text>
  <text start="1008.27" dur="5.34">any problems whatsoever and you can</text>
  <text start="1011.36" dur="5.49">download the software you can see how it</text>
  <text start="1013.61" dur="5.22">works make sure you take a copy of your</text>
  <text start="1016.85" dur="4.89">private key and you put it someplace</text>
  <text start="1018.83" dur="4.11">safe in a fireproof safe or something</text>
  <text start="1021.74" dur="2.88">like that and make sure it doesn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="1022.94" dur="3.99">damaged almost like if you get your bank</text>
  <text start="1024.62" dur="3.93">account you want to put that you know</text>
  <text start="1026.93" dur="2.85">someplace safe so you keep it and you</text>
  <text start="1028.55" dur="3.33">remember it and you know where it is</text>
  <text start="1029.78" dur="3.69">same thing with this you want to do the</text>
  <text start="1031.88" dur="3.6">same thing so those people who are</text>
  <text start="1033.47" dur="4.77">asking about the crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="1035.48" dur="5.43">that&amp;#39;s what I do I don&amp;#39;t have a lot of</text>
  <text start="1038.24" dur="6.54">them but you can see how it works you</text>
  <text start="1040.91" dur="6.84">can play with it you can purchase some</text>
  <text start="1044.78" dur="6.48">of them and through coinbase and through</text>
  <text start="1047.75" dur="6.24">bit tricks it allows you to use your</text>
  <text start="1051.26" dur="4.89">dollars and go out and purchase Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="1053.99" dur="3.66">and then from that point on then you can</text>
  <text start="1056.15" dur="3.78">you know exchange them or do whatever</text>
  <text start="1057.65" dur="4.56">you want to do and I do believe that</text>
  <text start="1059.93" dur="5.22">everyone should have some crypto</text>
  <text start="1062.21" dur="4.71">currencies because I think this is going</text>
  <text start="1065.15" dur="3.72">to be the wave of the future just like</text>
  <text start="1066.92" dur="4.08">the internet was the wave of the future</text>
  <text start="1068.87" dur="5.13">I do believe that you need to have gold</text>
  <text start="1071" dur="6.93">and silver still to safeguard your</text>
  <text start="1074" dur="5.48">wealth because over time thousands and</text>
  <text start="1077.93" dur="4.77">thousands of years</text>
  <text start="1079.48" dur="6.01">silver gold other precious metals have</text>
  <text start="1082.7" dur="5.58">been used to ensure your wealth do I</text>
  <text start="1085.49" dur="4.8">think we&amp;#39;re gonna be using it as some</text>
  <text start="1088.28" dur="5.52">type of currency no I think it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1090.29" dur="8.03">to be used to ensure to protect your</text>
  <text start="1093.8" dur="7.56">wealth from paper currency devaluing and</text>
  <text start="1098.32" dur="5.8">then you can take the gold the silver</text>
  <text start="1101.36" dur="5.52">and when everything is all said and done</text>
  <text start="1104.12" dur="5.07">you&amp;#39;ll be able to use that then and put</text>
  <text start="1106.88" dur="4.95">that into cryptocurrency or whatever the</text>
  <text start="1109.19" dur="4.8">next currency is going to be so I do</text>
  <text start="1111.83" dur="4.41">believe that you&amp;#39;re going to need cash</text>
