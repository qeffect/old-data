  <text start="61.34" dur="5.64">August 14th 2018 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="64.1" dur="3.96">episode is the central bank has taken</text>
  <text start="66.98" dur="4.32">its foot off the pedal</text>
  <text start="68.06" dur="5.37">we are coasting to the collapse let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="71.3" dur="4.92">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="73.43" dur="6.24">news now yesterday we talked about how</text>
  <text start="76.22" dur="5.7">Kim calm was saying that the dollar is</text>
  <text start="79.67" dur="4.32">going to collapse and everyone should</text>
  <text start="81.92" dur="5.16">move out of the dollar and move into</text>
  <text start="83.99" dur="4.62">gold or crypto currencies and we know</text>
  <text start="87.08" dur="3.42">that there&amp;#39;s a lot of countries out</text>
  <text start="88.61" dur="6.09">there where they are moving away from</text>
  <text start="90.5" dur="6.81">the dollar and putting their resources</text>
  <text start="94.7" dur="4.919">into the crypto market to avoid</text>
  <text start="97.31" dur="5.52">sanctions and Venezuela is one of these</text>
  <text start="99.619" dur="6.061">countries where Venezuela right now has</text>
  <text start="102.83" dur="6.33">created a cryptocurrency called the el</text>
  <text start="105.68" dur="6.96">petrol and right now they are</text>
  <text start="109.16" dur="6.09">state-owned oil company PDVSA they will</text>
  <text start="112.64" dur="6.63">start using the local cryptocurrency for</text>
  <text start="115.25" dur="6.03">all of its transactions on August 20th</text>
  <text start="119.27" dur="5.34">now we need to remember the central</text>
  <text start="121.28" dur="7.11">banks they do not like the crypto market</text>
  <text start="124.61" dur="7.409">it is way too hard to control something</text>
  <text start="128.39" dur="5.52">that is completely decentralized and NL</text>
  <text start="132.019" dur="3.841">if you like oh no it&amp;#39;s centralized no it</text>
  <text start="133.91" dur="3.66">is decentralized the only thing that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="135.86" dur="4.44">centralised right now are the exchanges</text>
  <text start="137.57" dur="6">and very soon those will be</text>
  <text start="140.3" dur="7.23">decentralized and a central bank needs</text>
  <text start="143.57" dur="6.27">to control the creation of that currency</text>
  <text start="147.53" dur="4.41">or the coin or whatever you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="149.84" dur="4.679">have they need centralization where</text>
  <text start="151.94" dur="6.63">everything comes from them they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="154.519" dur="5.401">have it where it&amp;#39;s decentralized they</text>
  <text start="158.57" dur="3.03">don&amp;#39;t have control over it</text>
  <text start="159.92" dur="4.89">they can&amp;#39;t push the button stop the</text>
  <text start="161.6" dur="5.76">button from creating currency they just</text>
  <text start="164.81" dur="5.31">can&amp;#39;t do it this is why countries this</text>
  <text start="167.36" dur="4.95">is why people this is why businesses are</text>
  <text start="170.12" dur="6.72">looking at this because they realize</text>
  <text start="172.31" dur="8.22">this takes the control out of the</text>
  <text start="176.84" dur="6.509">central bankers hands and we are seeing</text>
  <text start="180.53" dur="5.24">the beginning stages of this and this</text>
  <text start="183.349" dur="7.131">will move forward</text>
  <text start="185.77" dur="7.5">as the Fiat system dies now his gold and</text>
  <text start="190.48" dur="4.47">silver important of course it is gold</text>
  <text start="193.27" dur="3.48">and silver has been around for thousands</text>
  <text start="194.95" dur="3.66">and thousands of years I mean many</text>
  <text start="196.75" dur="4.83">people think like oh you can either have</text>
  <text start="198.61" dur="5.97">one or the other no that&amp;#39;s not true you</text>
  <text start="201.58" dur="5.1">can have both crypto currencies is a</text>
  <text start="204.58" dur="5.91">form of transacting</text>
  <text start="206.68" dur="5.91">on a low level Gold is retaining your</text>
  <text start="210.49" dur="5.55">wealth and this can be used on a higher</text>
  <text start="212.59" dur="6.84">level that gives people confidence it is</text>
  <text start="216.04" dur="5.49">backed by something and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="219.43" dur="5.46">you know think you can&amp;#39;t have both but</text>
  <text start="221.53" dur="7.26">you can now what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is</text>
  <text start="224.89" dur="6.09">that this entire system it&amp;#39;s breaking</text>
  <text start="228.79" dur="4.35">down and we&amp;#39;ve been following all the</text>
  <text start="230.98" dur="5.61">different indicators and we&amp;#39;ve looked in</text>
  <text start="233.14" dur="6.54">the past at the credit impulse and China</text>
  <text start="236.59" dur="6.72">China&amp;#39;s credit impulse has been</text>
  <text start="239.68" dur="7.44">shrinking and their shadow banking debt</text>
  <text start="243.31" dur="6.15">is collapsing now the latest data showed</text>
  <text start="247.12" dur="5.01">that China&amp;#39;s credit impulse is still</text>
  <text start="249.46" dur="5.22">negative and remains at the lowest level</text>
  <text start="252.13" dur="3.75">it has been for two years now people say</text>
  <text start="254.68" dur="3.179">what what are you talking about what is</text>
  <text start="255.88" dur="4.71">the credit impulse well the credit</text>
  <text start="257.859" dur="5.221">impulse is a term coined by Michael</text>
  <text start="260.59" dur="5.22">Biggs then economist at Deutsche Bank</text>
  <text start="263.08" dur="6.2">when in 2008 he defined it as the change</text>
  <text start="265.81" dur="5.91">a new credit issued as a percent of GDP</text>
  <text start="269.28" dur="4.09">now when we look at the credit impulse</text>
  <text start="271.72" dur="3.66">we can see that it has been declining</text>
  <text start="273.37" dur="3.9">for quite a while it&amp;#39;s been the negative</text>
  <text start="275.38" dur="3.3">territory and a lot of people look at</text>
  <text start="277.27" dur="1.98">this and say well if it&amp;#39;s in negative</text>
  <text start="278.68" dur="3.51">territory</text>
  <text start="279.25" dur="6.18">everything must crash well that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="282.19" dur="6.08">exactly true when the credit impulse</text>
  <text start="285.43" dur="5.79">turns negative it&amp;#39;s very similar to</text>
  <text start="288.27" dur="5.17">taking your foot off the gas pedal now</text>
  <text start="291.22" dur="4.65">you&amp;#39;re moving forward at say let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="293.44" dur="4.83">60 miles per hour you take your foot off</text>
  <text start="295.87" dur="4.98">the gas pedal does your car come to a</text>
  <text start="298.27" dur="6.12">complete stop no it does not what does</text>
  <text start="300.85" dur="4.38">it do it rolls forward for a period of</text>
  <text start="304.39" dur="3.63">time</text>
  <text start="305.23" dur="5.04">the central bank&amp;#39;s right now they are</text>
  <text start="308.02" dur="4.14">taking their foot off the gas pedal and</text>
  <text start="310.27" dur="3.66">we&amp;#39;re starting to see certain things</text>
  <text start="312.16" dur="3.41">happen the credit impulse is declining</text>
  <text start="313.93" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;re starting to see real estate</text>
  <text start="315.57" dur="4.039">implode on itself retail is a complete</text>
  <text start="318.34" dur="2.979">and utter design</text>
  <text start="319.609" dur="2.79">the job situation even though the</text>
  <text start="321.319" dur="4.35">numbers show us that we&amp;#39;re at full</text>
  <text start="322.399" dur="5.04">employment is absolutely ridiculous we</text>
  <text start="325.669" dur="5.39">have a lot of part-time people wages are</text>
  <text start="327.439" dur="6.33">declining the Fed now is unwinding and</text>
  <text start="331.059" dur="5.29">they&amp;#39;ve taken their foot off the gas</text>
  <text start="333.769" dur="5.31">pedal now we were going at a certain</text>
  <text start="336.349" dur="4.89">speed and since the central bank took</text>
  <text start="339.079" dur="5.13">their foot off the gas pedal we are</text>
  <text start="341.239" dur="4.77">going to coast towards a collapse that</text>
  <text start="344.209" dur="3.45">is what has been happening and a lot of</text>
  <text start="346.009" dur="3.39">people think well if they just start to</text>
  <text start="347.659" dur="3.27">unwind if they just start to do this we</text>
  <text start="349.399" dur="4.08">should hit the collapse right away no</text>
  <text start="350.929" dur="4.02">what happens is we were moving at a</text>
  <text start="353.479" dur="5.19">certain speed they were pumping</text>
  <text start="354.949" dur="6.72">everything up now they&amp;#39;ve stopped now</text>
  <text start="358.669" dur="5.1">everything&amp;#39;s starting to decline the</text>
  <text start="361.669" dur="4.38">opposite way now they were trying to</text>
  <text start="363.769" dur="5.13">push this forward and accelerate the</text>
  <text start="366.049" dur="4.74">process with raising interest rates and</text>
  <text start="368.899" dur="4.83">pushing this entire system to the edge</text>
  <text start="370.789" dur="4.98">now we both have the central bank and</text>
  <text start="373.729" dur="4.14">the Patriots fighting this out and who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="375.769" dur="4.23">going to control the narrative on the</text>
  <text start="377.869" dur="4.05">other hand we see there are countries</text>
  <text start="379.999" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re moving away from the dollar now</text>
  <text start="381.919" dur="4.14">a lot of people think well China needs</text>
  <text start="384.349" dur="3.81">to have the reserve currency and once</text>
  <text start="386.059" dur="4.801">their reserve currency is set up then</text>
  <text start="388.159" dur="5.76">the dollar will collapse not necessarily</text>
  <text start="390.86" dur="5.009">because as we can see Russia and many</text>
  <text start="393.919" dur="4.62">other countries all they have to do is</text>
  <text start="395.869" dur="4.92">turn towards their own currency which</text>
  <text start="398.539" dur="5.071">they&amp;#39;ve been doing now think about this</text>
  <text start="400.789" dur="5.4">for a second and Lavrov actually even</text>
  <text start="403.61" dur="4.829">said this that the u.s. with their gross</text>
  <text start="406.189" dur="4.62">misuse of the dollar will lead to its</text>
  <text start="408.439" dur="6.72">weakening and force a switch to other</text>
  <text start="410.809" dur="7.35">national currencies if countries lose</text>
  <text start="415.159" dur="5.85">faith and believe the United States is</text>
  <text start="418.159" dur="6.42">misusing the dollar for nefarious</text>
  <text start="421.009" dur="5.19">purposes and placing sanctions on</text>
  <text start="424.579" dur="3.48">countries starting wars which they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="426.199" dur="4.23">been doing for a very long time this has</text>
  <text start="428.059" dur="6.15">been the deep state countries all they</text>
  <text start="430.429" dur="6.06">need to do is dump the dollar and go to</text>
  <text start="434.209" dur="3.42">their national currencies and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="436.489" dur="3.75">even have to use their national</text>
  <text start="437.629" dur="4.08">currencies some other countries like</text>
  <text start="440.239" dur="2.97">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing with Venezuela and</text>
  <text start="441.709" dur="3.63">there&amp;#39;s going to speak certainly others</text>
  <text start="443.209" dur="3.66">they might even switch to crypto</text>
  <text start="445.339" dur="4.25">currencies and they can deal in crypto</text>
  <text start="446.869" dur="6.241">currencies some countries might use gold</text>
  <text start="449.589" dur="5.771">the point is for the dollar to</text>
  <text start="453.11" dur="4.8">collapse we don&amp;#39;t have to have a</text>
  <text start="455.36" dur="5.4">collapse of the economy we don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="457.91" dur="7.5">have China say we are the reserve</text>
  <text start="460.76" dur="7.02">currency the world all these different</text>
  <text start="465.41" dur="4.92">countries all they have to do is say you</text>
  <text start="467.78" dur="4.26">know something we don&amp;#39;t like what the US</text>
  <text start="470.33" dur="3.21">is doing with the dollar we don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="472.04" dur="2.76">the pressure they&amp;#39;re putting on</text>
  <text start="473.54" dur="3.42">different countries they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="474.8" dur="3.9">this for a very long time and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="476.96" dur="6.24">going to start using our national</text>
  <text start="478.7" dur="7.14">currencies Russia China India Syria Iran</text>
  <text start="483.2" dur="6.36">Egypt you name it</text>
  <text start="485.84" dur="6.69">Venezuela Brazil Argentina and the rest</text>
  <text start="489.56" dur="7.52">of the world all they need to do is then</text>
  <text start="492.53" dur="6.99">use their national currency the EU</text>
  <text start="497.08" dur="3.82">countries will look at this and say you</text>
  <text start="499.52" dur="2.76">know something why are we using the euro</text>
  <text start="500.9" dur="3.96">we don&amp;#39;t need to use this anymore</text>
  <text start="502.28" dur="6.54">let&amp;#39;s use our national currencies the</text>
  <text start="504.86" dur="7.23">Euro completely falls apart the euro the</text>
  <text start="508.82" dur="6.53">dollar this is all part of the central</text>
  <text start="512.09" dur="7.32">banking system and we can see the call</text>
  <text start="515.35" dur="6.99">to move away from the dollar is already</text>
  <text start="519.41" dur="5.37">out there and for a lot of countries</text>
  <text start="522.34" dur="4.51">they can easily do this actually the</text>
  <text start="524.78" dur="4.2">African nations are already saying</text>
  <text start="526.85" dur="4.8">there&amp;#39;s no reason and these all the</text>
  <text start="528.98" dur="5.82">emergency merging markets down in Africa</text>
  <text start="531.65" dur="5.37">there&amp;#39;s no reason to use the dollar we</text>
  <text start="534.8" dur="3.9">deal with China we deal with the yuan</text>
  <text start="537.02" dur="3.51">why we have why don&amp;#39;t we use the dollar</text>
  <text start="538.7" dur="4.85">why do we keep it in reserves there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="540.53" dur="6.12">reason for it do you purchase oil</text>
  <text start="543.55" dur="6.67">countries can use the petrol you want or</text>
  <text start="546.65" dur="7.38">they can use gold or with Venezuela they</text>
  <text start="550.22" dur="6.66">can use a cryptocurrency and you can see</text>
  <text start="554.03" dur="6">how quickly everything starts to fall</text>
  <text start="556.88" dur="4.44">apart now once countries stop using the</text>
  <text start="560.03" dur="3.51">dollar and they&amp;#39;re starting to use their</text>
  <text start="561.32" dur="4.91">national currencies they don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="563.54" dur="5.82">have to keep the dollar in reserves</text>
  <text start="566.23" dur="4.72">there&amp;#39;s no reason for it I mean we can</text>
  <text start="569.36" dur="3.51">see that Russia China they&amp;#39;re dealing</text>
  <text start="570.95" dur="3.75">outside the dollar India is dealing</text>
  <text start="572.87" dur="3.48">outside the dollar Iran is dealing</text>
  <text start="574.7" dur="4.05">outside the dollar Venezuela is doing</text>
  <text start="576.35" dur="3.9">and dealing outside the dollar all these</text>
  <text start="578.75" dur="3.99">countries are dealing outside the dollar</text>
  <text start="580.25" dur="5.01">yes in some fashion they&amp;#39;re still using</text>
  <text start="582.74" dur="3.6">dollar but it&amp;#39;s very easy to switch and</text>
  <text start="585.26" dur="1.53">I know a lot of people think well this</text>
  <text start="586.34" dur="2.19">is a very</text>
  <text start="586.79" dur="3.36">difficult thing and it will take a lot</text>
  <text start="588.53" dur="4.02">of time to switch and not not really I</text>
  <text start="590.15" dur="3.54">mean think about how quickly everyone</text>
  <text start="592.55" dur="4.29">got on board</text>
  <text start="593.69" dur="5.79">with the dollar in the 70s to pay for</text>
  <text start="596.84" dur="5.7">oil it&amp;#39;s because they were forced to do</text>
  <text start="599.48" dur="8.1">it if they were forced to move the other</text>
  <text start="602.54" dur="7.83">way guess what they will do it and once</text>
  <text start="607.58" dur="5.49">this happens and these countries don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="610.37" dur="4.38">have the dollar in their reserves where</text>
  <text start="613.07" dur="4.41">do those dollars go they come back to</text>
  <text start="614.75" dur="6.26">the US if they come back to the US we</text>
  <text start="617.48" dur="5.7">see hyperinflation what happens to the</text>
  <text start="621.01" dur="5.77">economy here in the United States it</text>
  <text start="623.18" dur="5.52">collapses so there&amp;#39;s many ways for the</text>
  <text start="626.78" dur="4.05">economy to a collapse here in the United</text>
  <text start="628.7" dur="5.88">States throughout Europe and again this</text>
  <text start="630.83" dur="7.35">is the central bankers economy this is</text>
  <text start="634.58" dur="5.34">an economy that needs to be crashed one</text>
  <text start="638.18" dur="4.29">way or another and if one plan doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="639.92" dur="4.71">work they will resort to a different</text>
  <text start="642.47" dur="3.75">plan now when we look at this and we can</text>
  <text start="644.63" dur="3.3">see all the different sanctions and all</text>
  <text start="646.22" dur="4.32">the pressure being put on all these</text>
  <text start="647.93" dur="5.06">different countries it seems like they</text>
  <text start="650.54" dur="5.76">might be doing this on purpose just like</text>
  <text start="652.99" dur="5.56">pushing the central bank to raise rates</text>
  <text start="656.3" dur="5.19">and it looks like they have planned</text>
  <text start="658.55" dur="5.4">after plan to make sure that this system</text>
  <text start="661.49" dur="5.4">comes down that&amp;#39;s the whole point of</text>
  <text start="663.95" dur="5.16">this is having the system come down to</text>
  <text start="666.89" dur="6.06">get out of the central banking system</text>
  <text start="669.11" dur="8.07">now remember before their entire push</text>
  <text start="672.95" dur="5.94">was to move to war and have the war mask</text>
  <text start="677.18" dur="3.21">everything else that was going on</text>
  <text start="678.89" dur="3.84">because the central banks the deep state</text>
  <text start="680.39" dur="4.26">they had full control of what was going</text>
  <text start="682.73" dur="4.53">on and they were ready to move to a</text>
  <text start="684.65" dur="5.4">brand new system there was no way out of</text>
  <text start="687.26" dur="5.19">it and we could see that this was their</text>
  <text start="690.05" dur="4.44">plan before and they were going to have</text>
  <text start="692.45" dur="4.02">the TPP and the rest where they can</text>
  <text start="694.49" dur="4.95">control all the countries and most</text>
  <text start="696.47" dur="6.05">likely once after this event that</text>
  <text start="699.44" dur="7.2">occurred they would usher in a new</text>
  <text start="702.52" dur="7.39">system and it looks like they were going</text>
  <text start="706.64" dur="4.89">to make the entire world use this system</text>
  <text start="709.91" dur="4.28">and not have all these different</text>
  <text start="711.53" dur="5.01">currencies because when you are</text>
  <text start="714.19" dur="3.55">diversified throughout the world and you</text>
  <text start="716.54" dur="3.959">have all these different national</text>
  <text start="717.74" dur="4.739">currencies very difficult to control you</text>
  <text start="720.499" dur="3.84">a central bank in each place you have to</text>
  <text start="722.479" dur="5.4">manage the country you have to put them</text>
  <text start="724.339" dur="5.94">into debt if you have one currency the</text>
  <text start="727.879" dur="4.14">central banks well its centralized it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="730.279" dur="3.93">much easier to control all these</text>
  <text start="732.019" dur="4.29">countries they don&amp;#39;t like countries</text>
  <text start="734.209" dur="3.45">having their own currency if they have</text>
  <text start="736.309" dur="3.75">their own currency it&amp;#39;s a little bit</text>
  <text start="737.659" dur="6.6">difficult to control think about the</text>
  <text start="740.059" dur="7.2">euro or all the countries in Europe most</text>
  <text start="744.259" dur="4.53">of them signed on to this well they have</text>
  <text start="747.259" dur="3.45">the ability to control all these</text>
  <text start="748.789" dur="3.81">countries they can put them into debt</text>
  <text start="750.709" dur="4.02">they can make them you know push</text>
  <text start="752.599" dur="4.95">austerity on the people they can make</text>
  <text start="754.729" dur="5.4">them pass certain laws they can you know</text>
  <text start="757.549" dur="4.71">bribe certain individuals in government</text>
  <text start="760.129" dur="3.81">to go along with this agenda and this</text>
  <text start="762.259" dur="6.21">was the beginning stages of it all</text>
  <text start="763.939" dur="8.34">but as we can see everything is changing</text>
  <text start="768.469" dur="6.69">right now countries now are looking at</text>
  <text start="772.279" dur="4.74">their national currencies they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="775.159" dur="5.16">you know something it&amp;#39;s more important</text>
  <text start="777.019" dur="5.79">that we use our national currency it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="780.319" dur="4.17">more important than having the Euro it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="782.809" dur="4.95">more important than anything else</text>
  <text start="784.489" dur="5.52">because when you use your own currency</text>
  <text start="787.759" dur="5.01">and you&amp;#39;re not dependent on a reserve</text>
  <text start="790.009" dur="3.48">currency you can control your country a</text>
  <text start="792.769" dur="2.46">lot better</text>
  <text start="793.489" dur="3.69">remember the central banks don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="795.229" dur="3.84">this they don&amp;#39;t like others having</text>
  <text start="797.179" dur="4.08">control because they want full control</text>
  <text start="799.069" dur="4.95">when I say they it&amp;#39;s the central bank</text>
  <text start="801.259" dur="4.5">and how do they control the world well</text>
  <text start="804.019" dur="4.26">they were doing it through sanctions</text>
  <text start="805.759" dur="5.13">this was coming out of the United States</text>
  <text start="808.279" dur="4.29">the deep state because everyone used the</text>
  <text start="810.889" dur="3.57">dollar it was very easy to play</text>
  <text start="812.569" dur="3.6">sanctions on these countries and to try</text>
  <text start="814.459" dur="4.17">to control the world in this fashion</text>
  <text start="816.169" dur="4.65">when countries started to move away from</text>
  <text start="818.629" dur="6.12">the dollar and maybe they wanted to sell</text>
  <text start="820.819" dur="7.23">oil using something else well force was</text>
  <text start="824.749" dur="6.57">used to push them back on the dollar and</text>
  <text start="828.049" dur="5.49">say no you will transact with the dollar</text>
  <text start="831.319" dur="4.5">you will sell all the oil using the</text>
  <text start="833.539" dur="4.62">dollar everything is changing right now</text>
  <text start="835.819" dur="5.43">and we can see already with Russia</text>
  <text start="838.159" dur="4.86">saying that listen it&amp;#39;s time to move</text>
  <text start="841.249" dur="3.48">away from the dollar it&amp;#39;s time to use</text>
  <text start="843.019" dur="3.72">the national currency there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="844.729" dur="4.5">to have the reserve currency we have</text>
  <text start="846.739" dur="5.34">other means of paying for oil other</text>
  <text start="849.229" dur="5.121">means of transacting we have other</text>
  <text start="852.079" dur="5.241">payment systems we have other</text>
  <text start="854.35" dur="5.97">we have everything set up in other</text>
  <text start="857.32" dur="5.97">places there&amp;#39;s no reason to continue on</text>
  <text start="860.32" dur="4.95">with the system the way it was this way</text>
  <text start="863.29" dur="3.66">if we move away from the system the</text>
  <text start="865.27" dur="3.9">central bankers the deep state they lose</text>
  <text start="866.95" dur="5.49">control and it looks like this is the</text>
  <text start="869.17" dur="5.67">push as we can see it that one way of</text>
  <text start="872.44" dur="4.59">getting rid of the central banks one way</text>
  <text start="874.84" dur="5.46">of getting rid of the deep state is to</text>
  <text start="877.03" dur="7.68">have every country go back to their</text>
  <text start="880.3" dur="9">national currencies don&amp;#39;t depend on a</text>
  <text start="884.71" dur="7.35">reserve currency pay for oil using</text>
  <text start="889.3" dur="5.37">everything but the dollar any other</text>
  <text start="892.06" dur="4.89">currency crypto currency gold silver</text>
  <text start="894.67" dur="4.47">doesn&amp;#39;t make a difference and we can see</text>
  <text start="896.95" dur="5.28">that this is a very big push right now</text>
  <text start="899.14" dur="5.61">and it looks like Russia along with</text>
  <text start="902.23" dur="5.37">China along with the United States the</text>
  <text start="904.75" dur="4.92">pushes to get rid of the central banks</text>
  <text start="907.6" dur="4.08">and I believe these countries are</text>
  <text start="909.67" dur="3.87">working together remember Putin took</text>
  <text start="911.68" dur="3.42">over the private western central bank</text>
  <text start="913.54" dur="3.6">he&amp;#39;s called the shots in his country</text>
  <text start="915.1" dur="4.05">right now I believe Trump is going to be</text>
  <text start="917.14" dur="4.92">doing the same thing and I think all of</text>
  <text start="919.15" dur="5.25">this together is going the move is to</text>
  <text start="922.06" dur="5.01">try to push out the central banking</text>
  <text start="924.4" dur="5.25">system yes it&amp;#39;s not going to be good</text>
  <text start="927.07" dur="4.38">times for many people many of the</text>
  <text start="929.65" dur="3.66">countries because there&amp;#39;s going to be an</text>
  <text start="931.45" dur="3.3">adjustment period a transition period</text>
  <text start="933.31" dur="3.96">where it&amp;#39;s going to be very very</text>
  <text start="934.75" dur="4.35">difficult and the debt that we&amp;#39;ve known</text>
  <text start="937.27" dur="4.62">for a very long time and the dollar that</text>
  <text start="939.1" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;ve used for a very long time well the</text>
  <text start="941.89" dur="3.39">value is going to continually decline</text>
  <text start="943.75" dur="4.65">and eventually it&amp;#39;s going to probably</text>
  <text start="945.28" dur="4.89">get so bad that no one would even want</text>
  <text start="948.4" dur="3.69">to use the dollar because of inflation</text>
  <text start="950.17" dur="4.14">which means it takes a lot more dollars</text>
  <text start="952.09" dur="3.78">to buy the piece of merchandise and we</text>
  <text start="954.31" dur="4.68">can see where now with the credit</text>
  <text start="955.87" dur="5.25">impulse at a negative area for a very</text>
  <text start="958.99" dur="4.2">long time now it&amp;#39;s not just like the</text>
  <text start="961.12" dur="4.44">last month or so it&amp;#39;s been there for</text>
  <text start="963.19" dur="3.69">quite a while it means that the central</text>
  <text start="965.56" dur="2.82">banks they&amp;#39;ve taken their foot off the</text>
  <text start="966.88" dur="3.3">gas pedal we&amp;#39;re coasting towards the</text>
  <text start="968.38" dur="4.74">collapse they&amp;#39;ve been trying to push</text>
  <text start="970.18" dur="5.03">this agenda by speeding it up with</text>
