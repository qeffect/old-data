  <text start="207.04" dur="6.27">huge buildup you can see it being</text>
  <text start="209.74" dur="6.21">created you can see it happening until</text>
  <text start="213.31" dur="4.89">that point that point where everything</text>
  <text start="215.95" dur="4.11">starts to fall apart and this is what</text>
  <text start="218.2" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at we&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="220.06" dur="4.89">at all the things that make up or</text>
  <text start="223.18" dur="5.58">collapse all the things that make up a</text>
  <text start="224.95" dur="5.67">war and we&amp;#39;re seeing it today and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="228.76" dur="4.47">getting to that point where you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="230.62" dur="4.35">to snap your finger and things are going</text>
  <text start="233.23" dur="5.82">to change your life is going to change</text>
  <text start="234.97" dur="6.72">the world is going to change and the</text>
  <text start="239.05" dur="5.79">jobs are not coming back to America as</text>
  <text start="241.69" dur="6.66">of yet Manufacturing is not coming back</text>
  <text start="244.84" dur="7.41">to America as of yet which we still we</text>
  <text start="248.35" dur="6.63">are still in this collapse scenario and</text>
  <text start="252.25" dur="5.13">we can see right now that the</text>
  <text start="254.98" dur="4.7">information that&amp;#39;s coming out and the</text>
  <text start="257.38" dur="5.85">BLS just put out information and</text>
  <text start="259.68" dur="5.71">compared to the adb adp report we can</text>
  <text start="263.23" dur="4.26">see that well they&amp;#39;ve gone in two</text>
  <text start="265.39" dur="5.79">opposite directions the BLS confirmed</text>
  <text start="267.49" dur="6.18">that something snapped in March when</text>
  <text start="271.18" dur="5.04">only 98 dot ninety eight thousand jobs</text>
  <text start="273.67" dur="5.25">were added roughly half of the hundred</text>
  <text start="276.22" dur="4.86">and eighty thousand suspected this was</text>
  <text start="278.92" dur="4.8">the lowest monthly job numbers since</text>
  <text start="281.08" dur="6.93">2016 and what we&amp;#39;re looking at right now</text>
  <text start="283.72" dur="7.35">is a decline and the unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="288.01" dur="5.07">because of this scratch our head came</text>
  <text start="291.07" dur="4.32">down to four point five percent it was</text>
  <text start="293.08" dur="5.79">at four point seven percent so again</text>
  <text start="295.39" dur="6.99">does that sound right to you know so</text>
  <text start="298.87" dur="6">what happened well things started to</text>
  <text start="302.38" dur="4.74">rapidly fall apart and I just wanted to</text>
  <text start="304.87" dur="4.29">go and talk about retail for a second</text>
  <text start="307.12" dur="4.049">and how bad retail is because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="309.16" dur="3.74">seeing all these economic economic</text>
  <text start="311.169" dur="3.511">indicators and they&amp;#39;re going from bad to</text>
  <text start="312.9" dur="4">worse now</text>
  <text start="314.68" dur="5.43">the retail sector right now slashed</text>
  <text start="316.9" dur="6.06">30,000 jobs in March this is coming from</text>
  <text start="320.11" dur="5.369">the BLS on Friday that brings the total</text>
  <text start="322.96" dur="4.079">number of jobs lost in retail and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="325.479" dur="3.121">not finished yet because remember</text>
  <text start="327.039" dur="4.051">there&amp;#39;s going to be about 3,500 stores</text>
  <text start="328.6" dur="6">closing so the number of jobs lost in</text>
  <text start="331.09" dur="6.299">march in February is around 60 1,000</text>
  <text start="334.6" dur="4.409">jobs in retail in March employment in</text>
  <text start="337.389" dur="4.441">general merchandise stores decline by</text>
  <text start="339.009" dur="4.591">35,000 the BLS said employment and</text>
  <text start="341.83" dur="4.83">general merchandise has fallen by eighty</text>
  <text start="343.6" dur="6.27">nine thousand jobs since its most recent</text>
  <text start="346.66" dur="7.56">high in October retail leads all sectors</text>
  <text start="349.87" dur="7.41">this year with 38 thousand 464 announced</text>
  <text start="354.22" dur="5.729">cuts 4000 of which occurred in March</text>
  <text start="357.28" dur="4.83">point of out placement consultancy</text>
  <text start="359.949" dur="4.821">challenger grand Christmas confirmed</text>
  <text start="362.11" dur="6.989">pneus first quarter retail job cuts are</text>
  <text start="364.77" dur="7.57">nineteen percent higher than the 31,000</text>
  <text start="369.099" dur="5.401">cuts in the same period of last year so</text>
  <text start="372.34" dur="6.109">when we look at this we can see that</text>
  <text start="374.5" dur="7.74">things have gotten worse and these</text>
  <text start="378.449" dur="6.701">stores the rest of the stores they</text>
  <text start="382.24" dur="6.33">haven&amp;#39;t even closed down yet this is a</text>
  <text start="385.15" dur="6.18">disaster in the making and it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="388.57" dur="6.24">worse the UK&amp;#39;s Telegraph just published</text>
  <text start="391.33" dur="6.03">an analysis of global debt and it sums</text>
  <text start="394.81" dur="5.4">up the crisis completely here&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="397.36" dur="5.01">they said global debt was climbed at an</text>

  <text start="428.409" dur="6.061">global gross domestic product what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="431.229" dur="5.881">happening here is we have this debt bomb</text>
  <text start="434.47" dur="5.91">and this debt bomb is about to go off</text>
  <text start="437.11" dur="6.72">and they&amp;#39;re warning us saying that this</text>
  <text start="440.38" dur="4.83">debt cannot be sustained and what is</text>
  <text start="443.83" dur="4.87">happening is we&amp;#39;re continually putting</text>
  <text start="445.21" dur="6.19">on more debt this tells us right now</text>
  <text start="448.7" dur="4.79">that things are rapidly falling apart</text>
  <text start="451.4" dur="5.1">and they&amp;#39;re telling you right now</text>
  <text start="453.49" dur="5.89">they&amp;#39;re noticing and there&amp;#39;s no way to</text>
  <text start="456.5" dur="5.16">avoid it anymore we have to report on it</text>
  <text start="459.38" dur="4.98">because people are bringing it up and</text>
  <text start="461.66" dur="4.59">there&amp;#39;s no end in sight Japan just</text>
  <text start="464.36" dur="3.57">passed a record high government budget</text>

  <text start="476.93" dur="4.77">corporate debt alone exceeds a hundred</text>
  <text start="479.12" dur="5.51">and seventy percent of GDP which leads</text>
  <text start="481.7" dur="5.73">to three in X capable conclusions</text>
  <text start="484.63" dur="4.48">interest rates can never rise because</text>
  <text start="487.43" dur="4.08">rolling over this much debt with</text>
  <text start="489.11" dur="4.14">historically normal rates would blow up</text>
  <text start="491.51" dur="4.32">the budgets of both the developed and</text>
  <text start="493.25" dur="5.25">developing worlds the only solution</text>
  <text start="495.83" dur="6.99">right now if you can call it that is a</text>
  <text start="498.5" dur="6.93">massive currency devaluation to make</text>
  <text start="502.82" dur="6.12">these debts manageable what does that</text>
  <text start="505.43" dur="5.88">mean if they devalue the dollar that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="508.94" dur="5.34">inflation it&amp;#39;s going to cost you a lot</text>
  <text start="511.31" dur="5.13">more of those pieces of paper to</text>
  <text start="514.28" dur="4.35">purchase your goods and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="516.44" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;re going to see here we already see</text>
  <text start="518.63" dur="4.77">the Atlanta Fed they have lowered now</text>
  <text start="521.69" dur="4.98">and this is an estimate they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="523.4" dur="6.12">predicting from all their data that GDP</text>
  <text start="526.67" dur="6.24">now is that point six percent and this</text>
  <text start="529.52" dur="6.84">is the manipulated number which means</text>
  <text start="532.91" dur="6.54">the real GDP is a negative territory and</text>
  <text start="536.36" dur="6.57">we know that Treasuries around the world</text>
  <text start="539.45" dur="8.19">are being dumped I mean listen to this</text>
  <text start="542.93" dur="6.63">from 1776 through 2007 the US issued</text>
  <text start="547.64" dur="4.26">just over nine trillion and US Treasury</text>
  <text start="549.56" dur="5.34">debt to pay for stuff which we wanted</text>
  <text start="551.9" dur="6.15">but we were unwilling to tax ourselves</text>
  <text start="554.9" dur="5.37">to pay for the majority buyer of this</text>
  <text start="558.05" dur="6.24">debt was the intra government surplus</text>
  <text start="560.27" dur="5.19">funds primarily Social Security you know</text>
  <text start="564.29" dur="3.51">all that money you put into Social</text>
  <text start="565.46" dur="5.03">Security these funds were mandated to by</text>
  <text start="567.8" dur="5.7">governmental accounting series</text>
  <text start="570.49" dur="5.08">non-marketable debt the remainder of the</text>
  <text start="573.5" dur="4.08">issuance and holding were fairly evenly</text>
  <text start="575.57" dur="4.74">split between foreigners and domestic</text>
  <text start="577.58" dur="4.56">buyers with a minor portion of primarily</text>
  <text start="580.31" dur="6.33">short-term notes and bills held by</text>
  <text start="582.14" dur="6.33">Federal Reserve from 2008 to 2014 the US</text>
  <text start="586.64" dur="5.58">Treasury nearly issued as much debt as</text>
  <text start="588.47" dur="6.36">it had in the previous 230 years but the</text>
  <text start="592.22" dur="4.62">proportions bought and held by these</text>
  <text start="594.83" dur="4.44">creditors significantly changed the</text>
  <text start="596.84" dur="6.06">intragovernmental surplus funds were</text>
  <text start="599.27" dur="6.48">dwindling social security so the buyer</text>
  <text start="602.9" dur="6.39">of nearly half of all the Treasury debt</text>
  <text start="605.75" dur="5.34">up to that point took a backseat buying</text>
  <text start="609.29" dur="4.2">only eight percent of the new issuance</text>
  <text start="611.09" dur="6.06">no surprise it was the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="613.49" dur="6.99">that stepped in and foreigners who</text>
  <text start="617.15" dur="5.49">bought the rest now since QE ended in</text>
  <text start="620.48" dur="4.17">late 2014 well we know it&amp;#39;s covertly</text>
  <text start="622.64" dur="3.84">happening in the background the makeup</text>
  <text start="624.65" dur="4.47">of the new buyers holders of the US</text>
  <text start="626.48" dur="5.45">Treasury debt is completely different</text>
  <text start="629.12" dur="6">the Federal Reserve has purchased</text>
  <text start="631.93" dur="5.47">nothing since the feds see spying and</text>
  <text start="635.12" dur="6">everyone saying well no that&amp;#39;s not true</text>
  <text start="637.4" dur="7.08">hold on foreigners has sworn off the US</text>
  <text start="641.12" dur="5.31">Treasury debt and sold 200 billion so</text>
  <text start="644.48" dur="3.99">the only buyers for the continuing</text>
  <text start="646.43" dur="4.23">issued issuance and the portion not</text>
  <text start="648.47" dur="4.44">rolled over by foreigners is the</text>
  <text start="650.66" dur="4.17">domestic public now this is where it</text>
  <text start="652.91" dur="5.1">gets a little interesting so the</text>
  <text start="654.83" dur="6">question is who among the domestic</text>
  <text start="658.01" dur="5.37">public is buying all those still near</text>
  <text start="660.83" dur="5.1">record low yielding Treasuries according</text>
  <text start="663.38" dur="5.43">to the latest Treasury Bolton well we</text>
  <text start="665.93" dur="5.4">found our answer and it&amp;#39;s clear as day</text>
  <text start="668.81" dur="4.38">not really it&amp;#39;s called other investors</text>
  <text start="671.33" dur="4.91">so you say well who are the other</text>
  <text start="673.19" dur="6.09">investors who are these primary buyers</text>
  <text start="676.24" dur="6.1">interestingly the other category has</text>
  <text start="679.28" dur="5.79">nearly doubled since 2014 from less than</text>
  <text start="682.34" dur="5.3">a trillion to 1.8 trillion so the</text>
  <text start="685.07" dur="5.13">Treasury market is supported by other</text>
  <text start="687.64" dur="5.32">investors which unfortunately the</text>

  <text start="698.18" dur="7.95">intragovernmental surplus again coming</text>
  <text start="701.9" dur="7.38">from the Treasury so we can see that</text>
  <text start="706.13" dur="6.39">most likely it&amp;#39;s coming from the</text>
  <text start="709.28" dur="4.68">Treasury and this is a main problem</text>
  <text start="712.52" dur="3.43">because the Treasuries were normally</text>
  <text start="713.96" dur="4.87">sold two countries and now</text>
  <text start="715.95" dur="6.06">the United States not even the Federal</text>
  <text start="718.83" dur="5.28">Reserve they&amp;#39;re buying the Treasuries I</text>
  <text start="722.01" dur="4.59">mean think about what&amp;#39;s happening right</text>
  <text start="724.11" dur="4.14">now it&amp;#39;s a complete disaster and this</text>
  <text start="726.6" dur="3.87">will think it&amp;#39;s even worse because we</text>
  <text start="728.25" dur="4.32">know that the market is not going to</text>

  <text start="732.57" dur="7.46">not based on anything and traders now</text>
  <text start="735.75" dur="8.49">are selling insurance to protect against</text>
  <text start="740.03" dur="8.14">volatility using a feedback loop theory</text>
  <text start="744.24" dur="6.96">now if they do this and there&amp;#39;s a shock</text>
  <text start="748.17" dur="5.97">in the system and the system collapses</text>
  <text start="751.2" dur="4.74">this is a terrible scenario because all</text>
  <text start="754.14" dur="4.26">those who are supplying the insurance</text>
  <text start="755.94" dur="4.17">guess what happens they&amp;#39;re going out of</text>
  <text start="758.4" dur="4.53">business they&amp;#39;re not going to be able to</text>
  <text start="760.11" dur="5.85">pay up people can pretend that the</text>
  <text start="762.93" dur="6.57">insurance is there and it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="765.96" dur="5.85">the FDIC when the system includes the</text>

  <text start="774.15" dur="5.46">that&amp;#39;s why they created the bail in</text>

  <text start="779.61" dur="5.22">right now this entire system from</text>
  <text start="782.4" dur="5.61">everywhere we look cannot be sustained</text>
