  <text start="52.549" dur="4.781">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse now</text>
  <text start="55.589" dur="4.171">we understand the US government the</text>
  <text start="57.33" dur="4.77">central bankers they need to control the</text>
  <text start="59.76" dur="5.16">flow of information I mean according to</text>
  <text start="62.1" dur="5.16">Naomi Wolf&amp;#39;s ten steps and how did that</text>
  <text start="64.92" dur="4.739">closed down a society we understand that</text>
  <text start="67.26" dur="5.609">this is one of the steps we understand</text>
  <text start="69.659" dur="4.95">they issue propaganda to the corporate</text>
  <text start="72.869" dur="4.591">media and the poor but media goes out</text>
  <text start="74.609" dur="4.171">and publish it reports on it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="77.46" dur="2.46">matter if it&amp;#39;s true of to lie or</text>
  <text start="78.78" dur="3.6">anything like that it&amp;#39;s complete</text>
  <text start="79.92" dur="4.769">propaganda to make the American people</text>
  <text start="82.38" dur="5.279">and the world think in a certain way and</text>
  <text start="84.689" dur="5.43">they cannot stand the alternative / new</text>
  <text start="87.659" dur="6.17">media and they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out</text>
  <text start="90.119" dur="5.85">all different ways to shut it down and</text>
  <text start="93.829" dur="3.941">of course we&amp;#39;ve seen it in the past</text>
  <text start="95.969" dur="4.231">where they shut down sites that shut</text>
  <text start="97.77" dur="5.19">down like YouTube Facebook if the</text>
  <text start="100.2" dur="5.129">reporting really goes on and they hit a</text>
  <text start="102.96" dur="4.17">subject all of a sudden something is</text>
  <text start="105.329" dur="4.951">completely shut down but there have been</text>
  <text start="107.13" dur="5.869">laws and bills i should say bills not</text>
  <text start="110.28" dur="5.189">really laws that have been proposed and</text>
  <text start="112.999" dur="4.421">here&amp;#39;s one of them and you can see the</text>
  <text start="115.469" dur="3.271">direction that they are going by the</text>
  <text start="117.42" dur="3.75">bills that they&amp;#39;re trying to propose</text>
  <text start="118.74" dur="5.489">there is a bill that was proposed by</text>
  <text start="121.17" dur="6.509">Senator John McCain in which he proposed</text>
  <text start="124.229" dur="6.241">that bloggers be fined up to 300,000</text>
  <text start="127.679" dur="5.431">dollars for offensive statements photos</text>
  <text start="130.47" dur="6.299">videos posted by visitors on comment</text>
  <text start="133.11" dur="6.659">boards I mean does that go against free</text>
  <text start="136.769" dur="4.421">speech I mean it certainly does it</text>
  <text start="139.769" dur="4.121">violates our right</text>
  <text start="141.19" dur="5.55">but this is the things that they propose</text>
  <text start="143.89" dur="5.46">so you can see their mindset you can see</text>
  <text start="146.74" dur="7.77">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do here now the</text>
  <text start="149.35" dur="7.32">FCC as we know they are working to make</text>
  <text start="154.51" dur="3.75">the internet a public utility and the</text>
  <text start="156.67" dur="3.12">first step for them controlling</text>
  <text start="158.26" dur="6.6">something without people knowing about</text>
  <text start="159.79" dur="7.53">it is to tax and to issue licenses and</text>
  <text start="164.86" dur="5.46">we&amp;#39;ve discussed this before and we can</text>
  <text start="167.32" dur="8.88">see that the FCC is heading down that</text>
  <text start="170.32" dur="7.95">road because they need to control what</text>
  <text start="176.2" dur="4.02">is being said on the internet because it</text>
  <text start="178.27" dur="4.44">is countering everything the government</text>
  <text start="180.22" dur="4.5">is trying to do with their propaganda</text>
  <text start="182.71" dur="4.35">and we understand from a met amendment</text>
  <text start="184.72" dur="5.13">11 for the Smith month Act of 2012</text>
  <text start="187.06" dur="6.03">section 501 the United States government</text>
  <text start="189.85" dur="5.34">is now allowed to use propaganda against</text>
  <text start="193.09" dur="4.89">the American people and they have been</text>
  <text start="195.19" dur="8.31">doing this for quite a while and we can</text>
  <text start="197.98" dur="7.83">see that it&amp;#39;s just not the government</text>
  <text start="203.5" dur="6">that is shutting us down their</text>
  <text start="205.81" dur="7.14">connections with search engines with</text>
  <text start="209.5" dur="5.94">other Internet companies they are kind</text>
  <text start="212.95" dur="5.64">of helping because if they report</text>
  <text start="215.44" dur="5.34">something those companies kind of block</text>
  <text start="218.59" dur="4.17">certain sites we seen it with Google</text>
  <text start="220.78" dur="4.11">many times before where they all say</text>
  <text start="222.76" dur="3.96">others malware and you see that page</text>
  <text start="224.89" dur="3.18">where it comes out you know enter at</text>
  <text start="226.72" dur="2.55">your own risk because there could be</text>
  <text start="228.07" dur="4.52">malware and it could infect your</text>
  <text start="229.27" dur="5.969">computer this is a way of blocking a</text>
  <text start="232.59" dur="7.09">site where they don&amp;#39;t want people to go</text>
  <text start="235.239" dur="6.451">to now sometimes the website owner has</text>
  <text start="239.68" dur="4.5">to prove that no there is no malware</text>
  <text start="241.69" dur="5.61">whatsoever it is perfectly safe and it</text>
  <text start="244.18" dur="5.339">comes down sometimes YouTube channels</text>
  <text start="247.3" dur="3.6">are brought down and then people</text>
  <text start="249.519" dur="3.121">complain saying why did you bring me</text>
  <text start="250.9" dur="3.15">down give me the reason I&amp;#39;ve never had</text>
  <text start="252.64" dur="4.379">any strikes against me and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="254.05" dur="6.39">brought back up but they continually try</text>
  <text start="257.019" dur="7.711">to censor what people are trying to say</text>
  <text start="260.44" dur="8.13">and what people are trying to see right</text>
  <text start="264.73" dur="7.47">now we see the TSA they are getting more</text>
  <text start="268.57" dur="6.09">power US Representative John Catco</text>
  <text start="272.2" dur="4.5">introduced two bills he&amp;#39;s looking to a</text>
  <text start="274.66" dur="4.89">effectively closed the borders using</text>
  <text start="276.7" dur="4.8">terrorism cacos bill will direct the TSA</text>
  <text start="279.55" dur="6.06">office of inspection Accountability Act</text>
  <text start="281.5" dur="6.45">HR 719 requiring TSA now to conduct</text>
  <text start="285.61" dur="3.89">criminal investigations spending at</text>
  <text start="287.95" dur="4.53">least fifty percent of their time</text>
  <text start="289.5" dur="5.17">investigating apprehending or detaining</text>
  <text start="292.48" dur="5.16">individuals individual suspected of</text>
  <text start="294.67" dur="7.74">committing a crime or tax evasion and</text>
  <text start="297.64" dur="8.22">like we said before the government needs</text>
  <text start="302.41" dur="6.75">to find revenue and they will stop</text>
  <text start="305.86" dur="6.33">people from leaving this country they</text>
  <text start="309.16" dur="8.61">will close down the borders and have the</text>
  <text start="312.19" dur="8.37">TSA DHS or any other law enforcement to</text>
  <text start="317.77" dur="5.34">stop people from leaving and we see this</text>
  <text start="320.56" dur="5.1">is started already we see that this is</text>
  <text start="323.11" dur="4.95">on way the bill will now result in the</text>
  <text start="325.66" dur="5.33">arrest of anyone for any alleged crime</text>
  <text start="328.06" dur="6.12">whatsoever that will apply to taxes</text>
  <text start="330.99" dur="5.62">Catco is constructing a highly dangerous</text>
  <text start="334.18" dur="4.56">version of the berlin wall around all</text>
  <text start="336.61" dur="4.77">american citizen he is converting the</text>
  <text start="338.74" dur="4.47">tsa into a police force less concerned</text>
  <text start="341.38" dur="4.58">about air safety and focus more on</text>
  <text start="343.21" dur="5.88">catching anyone the government can argue</text>
  <text start="345.96" dur="6.22">violate some law federal or state it is</text>
  <text start="349.09" dur="6.75">a bro it is so broad this would apply to</text>
  <text start="352.18" dur="7.59">domestic disputes as well so you can see</text>
  <text start="355.84" dur="7.47">the path we are heading down a complete</text>
  <text start="359.77" dur="6.51">police state and they&amp;#39;re creating or</text>
  <text start="363.31" dur="5.19">proposing bills that will close the</text>
  <text start="366.28" dur="5.73">system down and this goes right to our</text>
  <text start="368.5" dur="6.96">ten steps of closing down a society in</text>
  <text start="372.01" dur="6.51">the EU what do we see well the EU wants</text>
  <text start="375.46" dur="5.52">to snoop on skype to combat terrorist</text>
  <text start="378.52" dur="4.649">threats that we know this is not what</text>
  <text start="380.98" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s about whatsoever they want to</text>
  <text start="383.169" dur="4.681">listen on listen into everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="385.51" dur="5.12">conversation they&amp;#39;re keeping track of</text>
  <text start="387.85" dur="6.45">the people making social profiles and</text>
  <text start="390.63" dur="6.52">making a list of those people who are a</text>
  <text start="394.3" dur="4.26">threat to their authority and we can see</text>
  <text start="397.15" dur="2.61">when we look across the world and we</text>
  <text start="398.56" dur="4.35">understand what&amp;#39;s going on here that</text>
  <text start="399.76" dur="5.46">they are creating police forces to deal</text>
  <text start="402.91" dur="5.499">with civil disputes it&amp;#39;s happening in</text>
  <text start="405.22" dur="6.429">France and Spain in Italy in</text>
  <text start="408.409" dur="5.13">UK the entire eurozone they have their</text>
  <text start="411.649" dur="5.61">own special police force and here in the</text>
  <text start="413.539" dur="7.38">United States they are trying to close</text>
  <text start="417.259" dur="7.86">down all of these countries to keep the</text>
  <text start="420.919" dur="7.14">people in fear and to ramp up with their</text>
  <text start="425.119" dur="4.59">militarized police force and this is on</text>
  <text start="428.059" dur="5.64">gun because they realize what&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="429.709" dur="5.94">they realize the collapse is right</text>
  <text start="433.699" dur="4.8">around the corner they realize there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="435.649" dur="5.461">nothing they can do to stop this yes</text>
  <text start="438.499" dur="4.71">will they try to cover it up with more</text>
  <text start="441.11" dur="5.369">with an event yes but it will not stop</text>
  <text start="443.209" dur="5.97">the collapse so at the same time these</text>
  <text start="446.479" dur="5.37">systems are collapsing people are</text>
  <text start="449.179" dur="5.97">rioting people are struggling to find</text>
  <text start="451.849" dur="5.64">food to find water to protect their</text>
  <text start="455.149" dur="4.41">families to try to understand what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="457.489" dur="3.35">going on and a lot of these people will</text>
  <text start="459.559" dur="4.23">not be able to handle the situation</text>
  <text start="460.839" dur="5.62">they&amp;#39;re not prepared for this and it</text>
  <text start="463.789" dur="5.13">reminds me of the matrix when they first</text>
  <text start="466.459" dur="4.95">released neo from the matrix and he</text>
  <text start="468.919" dur="4.2">started to realize what was going on and</text>
  <text start="471.409" dur="3.96">they said he&amp;#39;s going to pop he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="473.119" dur="4.23">pop and a lot of people will pop a lot</text>
  <text start="475.369" dur="4.71">of people will have a nervous breakdown</text>
  <text start="477.349" dur="5.13">because they don&amp;#39;t understand what just</text>
  <text start="480.079" dur="6.36">happened one day you are fine you can go</text>
  <text start="482.479" dur="5.73">to the market you have a job and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="486.439" dur="4.38">thinking about going on vacation you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="488.209" dur="5.07">thinking about everything else except</text>
  <text start="490.819" dur="3.81">what is really coming because the United</text>
  <text start="493.279" dur="4.8">States government the central bankers</text>
  <text start="494.629" dur="5.04">has kept everyone in the dark and of</text>
  <text start="498.079" dur="6.59">course they&amp;#39;re gonna try to cover this</text>
  <text start="499.669" dur="7.5">up with Oh Russia China North Korea Iran</text>
  <text start="504.669" dur="4.33">you name it it&amp;#39;s the same players all</text>
  <text start="507.169" dur="4.47">the time they&amp;#39;re the ones who did this</text>
  <text start="508.999" dur="5.16">to us and i forgot the islamic state of</text>
  <text start="511.639" dur="4.44">course which is a proxy from before the</text>
  <text start="514.159" dur="5.19">United States government Israel UK and</text>
  <text start="516.079" dur="4.82">other nations so we can see where we are</text>
  <text start="519.349" dur="4.98">headed and this is why they have</text>
  <text start="520.899" dur="6.49">increased the spying on all the people</text>
  <text start="524.329" dur="5.581">because they need to understand who you</text>
  <text start="527.389" dur="4.981">know who you&amp;#39;ve been talking to where</text>
  <text start="529.91" dur="5.25">you are going if you have extra money</text>
  <text start="532.37" dur="5.04">are you hiding money are you prepping</text>
  <text start="535.16" dur="5.13">they need to know all this information</text>
  <text start="537.41" dur="4.679">and we can see out in Eastern Europe in</text>
  <text start="540.29" dur="4.049">Ukraine they</text>
  <text start="542.089" dur="5.94">are pushing for more and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="544.339" dur="5.16">stopping you can see that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="548.029" dur="3.72">government central mangers they only</text>
  <text start="549.499" dur="4.741">think in one way and that is war at this</text>
  <text start="551.749" dur="4.621">point in time Putin put forth a peace</text>
  <text start="554.24" dur="5.159">plan did you see a peace plan from the</text>
  <text start="556.37" dur="5.43">Nobel Peace Prize winner the President</text>
  <text start="559.399" dur="4.88">of the United States who got the Nobel</text>
  <text start="561.8" dur="6.99">Peace Prize for Peace where was his</text>
  <text start="564.279" dur="7.3">peace plan non-existent where was any of</text>
  <text start="568.79" dur="6.149">the peace plans from Europe or from the</text>
  <text start="571.579" dur="5.19">United States non-existent and we could</text>
  <text start="574.939" dur="3.661">see Biden is out there Joe Biden said</text>
  <text start="576.769" dur="4.17">that Kiev had a right to defend itself</text>
  <text start="578.6" dur="3.81">against Russia and that the United</text>
  <text start="580.939" dur="3.75">States would provide it with the means</text>
  <text start="582.41" dur="5.76">to do so well the thing he&amp;#39;s leaving out</text>
  <text start="584.689" dur="6.45">is that Ukraine is the one that is</text>
  <text start="588.17" dur="4.669">attacking so really it&amp;#39;s the actual</text>
  <text start="591.139" dur="3.93">opposite and I always said this</text>
  <text start="592.839" dur="4.031">government officials whenever they speak</text>
  <text start="595.069" dur="3.96">think about what they&amp;#39;re saying and</text>
  <text start="596.87" dur="6.24">think in the opposite way what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="599.029" dur="5.761">saying is that ah those south eastern</text>
  <text start="603.11" dur="4.11">people they have a right to defend</text>
  <text start="604.79" dur="4.589">themselves but he&amp;#39;s trying to switch it</text>
  <text start="607.22" dur="3.659">around and make it seem like oh they</text>
  <text start="609.379" dur="3.721">were attacking us so we have the right</text>
  <text start="610.879" dur="4.26">to defend ourselves we&amp;#39;re actually the</text>
  <text start="613.1" dur="4.02">opposite is happening they&amp;#39;re the ones</text>
  <text start="615.139" dur="5.281">they&amp;#39;re the aggressors they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="617.12" dur="4.86">attackers and they will not let up and</text>
  <text start="620.42" dur="3.599">he went on to say that too many times</text>
  <text start="621.98" dur="4.829">President Putin has promised peace and</text>
  <text start="624.019" dur="7.5">delivered tanks troops and weapons again</text>
  <text start="626.809" dur="6.63">saying this without proof he&amp;#39;s putting</text>
  <text start="631.519" dur="4.44">out propaganda to convince everyone that</text>
  <text start="633.439" dur="5.671">this is what&amp;#39;s happening but when you</text>
  <text start="635.959" dur="5.85">look and you look past his propaganda</text>
  <text start="639.11" dur="4.889">where are the satellite images in 3d</text>
  <text start="641.809" dur="4.681">color showing the insignias of these</text>
  <text start="643.999" dur="4.44">tanks where are the troops they have</text>
  <text start="646.49" dur="5.61">absolutely no proof and believe me if</text>
  <text start="648.439" dur="5.221">Russia was in there of course again they</text>
  <text start="652.1" dur="3.719">would use air power in the beginning and</text>
  <text start="653.66" dur="6.179">it would be over and probably what two</text>
  <text start="655.819" dur="5.82">three days Kiev would be crushed but at</text>
  <text start="659.839" dur="3.93">this point in time we can see they have</text>
  <text start="661.639" dur="4.14">no proof so they have to continually use</text>
  <text start="663.769" dur="3.841">propaganda to convince everyone and many</text>
  <text start="665.779" dur="4.65">people do believe this is if that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="667.61" dur="5.819">they say it has to be true no at this</text>
  <text start="670.429" dur="4.961">point we need proof and guess what they</text>
  <text start="673.429" dur="7.001">can&amp;#39;t provide it</text>
  <text start="675.39" dur="8.89">and we can see that Angela Merkel and</text>
  <text start="680.43" dur="6.73">president hon they are trying to broker</text>
  <text start="684.28" dur="6.03">peace because they realize that without</text>
  <text start="687.16" dur="6.72">peace this war is going to go hot and</text>
  <text start="690.31" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s going to involve Europe and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="693.88" dur="3.12">scratching their heads thinking</text>
  <text start="695.05" dur="4.77">themselves do we really want this and</text>
  <text start="697" dur="6.9">they&amp;#39;re saying no there we have to go</text>
  <text start="699.82" dur="6.05">with peace here but again NATO the</text>
  <text start="703.9" dur="4.29">United States the central banking system</text>
  <text start="705.87" dur="3.82">they know the system is collapsing they</text>
  <text start="708.19" dur="4.62">don&amp;#39;t want peace and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="709.69" dur="4.95">pushing for war the chief commander of</text>
  <text start="712.81" dur="4.23">NATO said the proposal made by Russian</text>
  <text start="714.64" dur="4.2">President Putin to end the conflict in</text>
  <text start="717.04" dur="3.81">eastern Ukraine was completely</text>
  <text start="718.84" dur="4.79">unacceptable and we have to push for war</text>
  <text start="720.85" dur="5.16">I mean this is absolutely ridiculous</text>
  <text start="723.63" dur="4.96">because if they really wanted peace if</text>
  <text start="726.01" dur="5.07">you really want something like peace</text>
  <text start="728.59" dur="6">where you want to stop the killing you</text>
  <text start="731.08" dur="6.54">would make every single effort to stop</text>
  <text start="734.59" dur="7.8">the killing it&amp;#39;s very easy to do it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="737.62" dur="6.81">only when you don&amp;#39;t that&amp;#39;s when you</text>
  <text start="742.39" dur="5.91">don&amp;#39;t have peace and we can see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="744.43" dur="5.88">on their way Sergey Lavrov has lashed</text>
  <text start="748.3" dur="3.84">out at the US for their double standards</text>
  <text start="750.31" dur="4.65">over Ukraine and taking steps that only</text>
  <text start="752.14" dur="4.41">promoted further aggression one of the</text>
  <text start="754.96" dur="3.78">major sticking points of the crisis so</text>
  <text start="756.55" dur="3.81">far has been the failure of Kiev to</text>
  <text start="758.74" dur="4.11">engage in talks with the militia leaders</text>
  <text start="760.36" dur="5.34">in east of the country they are</text>
  <text start="762.85" dur="6">excluding the people in the southeastern</text>
  <text start="765.7" dur="5.52">section because and they&amp;#39;re dodging all</text>
  <text start="768.85" dur="6.09">these peace meetings they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="771.22" dur="7.38">peace their attention is for war only</text>
  <text start="774.94" dur="6">and that is eat that is it so we see</text>
  <text start="778.6" dur="4.77">France and Germany they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="780.94" dur="4.98">push forward this peace initiative this</text>
  <text start="783.37" dur="4.86">is the last ditch attempt to end the war</text>
  <text start="785.92" dur="6.18">in Ukraine and French president Hollande</text>
  <text start="788.23" dur="8.37">said with Angela Merkel that the crisis</text>
  <text start="792.1" dur="7.02">cannot be solved militarily well depends</text>
  <text start="796.6" dur="3.99">on how you looking at this will it cover</text>
  <text start="799.12" dur="3.42">up the collapse will it bring us into</text>
  <text start="800.59" dur="5.79">World War three well this is what the</text>
  <text start="802.54" dur="5.85">central bankers want olam described the</text>
  <text start="806.38" dur="2.62">peace talks he and Merkel hell with the</text>

  <text start="811.07" dur="6.03">the last chances for peace if we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="813.98" dur="5.1">fall if we don&amp;#39;t find not just a</text>
  <text start="817.1" dur="4.56">compromise but a lasting peace agreement</text>
  <text start="819.08" dur="6.45">we know perfectly well what the scenario</text>
  <text start="821.66" dur="6.96">will be it has a name it&amp;#39;s called war</text>
  <text start="825.53" dur="5.73">and this is coming from present oman he</text>
  <text start="828.62" dur="4.76">understands what is coming he realizes</text>
  <text start="831.26" dur="7.17">that this war is going to be fought not</text>
  <text start="833.38" dur="9.94">just in russia not just in ukraine but</text>
  <text start="838.43" dur="7.11">in Germany in France in Italy in Europe</text>
  <text start="843.32" dur="5.64">and today&amp;#39;s with and with today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="845.54" dur="6.27">technology with ballistic missiles it</text>
  <text start="848.96" dur="6.06">will be fought in the United States this</text>
  <text start="851.81" dur="5.34">is not World War two they have the</text>
  <text start="855.02" dur="4.32">ability to launch missiles that will</text>
  <text start="857.15" dur="7.08">reach the united states that will</text>
  <text start="859.34" dur="9.6">explode in the cities and kill many many</text>
  <text start="864.23" dur="8.28">people times have changed the weapons</text>
  <text start="868.94" dur="6.09">are more advanced this war will be like</text>
  <text start="872.51" dur="5.34">none we have ever seen in our lifetime</text>
  <text start="875.03" dur="5.4">and eventually when the central bankers</text>
  <text start="877.85" dur="7.31">aren&amp;#39;t winning they will use nuclear</text>
  <text start="880.43" dur="7.5">weapons in the end biden went on to say</text>
  <text start="885.16" dur="4.24">because of these peace talks and because</text>
  <text start="887.93" dur="3.45">the europeans are questioning the</text>
  <text start="889.4" dur="5.33">sanctions he says they&amp;#39;re inappropriate</text>
  <text start="891.38" dur="8.31">and annoying does that sound like peace</text>
  <text start="894.73" dur="6.31">or does he say europe get in line you</text>
  <text start="899.69" dur="3.54">have to be in line with the united</text>
  <text start="901.04" dur="3.51">states because we are going to war stop</text>
  <text start="903.23" dur="4.1">with your complaining about these</text>
  <text start="904.55" dur="5.52">sanctions stop it you&amp;#39;re annoying us</text>
  <text start="907.33" dur="5.009">because we&amp;#39;re going in one direction and</text>
  <text start="910.07" dur="5.82">one direction only and that is to war</text>
  <text start="912.339" dur="5.411">mccain is out there he is saying and he</text>
  <text start="915.89" dur="4.35">has criticized the German Chancellor</text>
  <text start="917.75" dur="4.23">Angela Merkel for not yielding and</text>
  <text start="920.24" dur="5.25">supplying arms to Ukraine Tina what</text>
  <text start="921.98" dur="5.13">piece one might think she does not know</text>
  <text start="925.49" dur="4.32">or does not care that the people are</text>
  <text start="927.11" dur="4.77">being slaughtered in Ukraine yes John</text>
  <text start="929.81" dur="4.86">McCain they are being slaughtered so</text>
  <text start="931.88" dur="6.57">stop shelling the civilian areas it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="934.67" dur="7.73">very simple but again they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="938.45" dur="7.52">to the peace talks right now are</text>
  <text start="942.4" dur="5.13">not working out poroshenko is doing</text>
  <text start="945.97" dur="3.75">exactly what the central bankers want</text>
  <text start="947.53" dur="6.21">John Kerry was in Ukraine his</text>
  <text start="949.72" dur="6.09">instructions are start the war do</text>
  <text start="953.74" dur="4.23">whatever you have to but start the war</text>
  <text start="955.81" dur="4.83">poroshenko says Ukraine doesn&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="957.97" dur="6.78">peacekeepers now poroshenko says</text>
  <text start="960.64" dur="6.3">priority is ceasefire and rush and pull</text>
  <text start="964.75" dur="6.06">out but you see how they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="966.94" dur="7.02">using something that isn&amp;#39;t true so they</text>
  <text start="970.81" dur="5.19">can push the war Russia is not there so</text>
  <text start="973.96" dur="4.62">they can&amp;#39;t pull out basically what they</text>
  <text start="976" dur="5.52">really want is the return of Crimea and</text>
  <text start="978.58" dur="5.67">the southeastern section this is what</text>
  <text start="981.52" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re really saying to Russia and this</text>
  <text start="984.25" dur="4.59">is not going to happen because the</text>
  <text start="986.98" dur="4.68">people have the right to fight for</text>
  <text start="988.84" dur="4.92">freedom for democracy just like the</text>

  <text start="998.37" dur="5.35">according to the United States to fight</text>
