  <text start="268.57" dur="6.659">unbearably personally and unattainable</text>
  <text start="272.44" dur="6.16">professionally sounds like our</text>

  <text start="278.6" dur="5.67">impeachment disgruntled individuals and</text>

  <text start="293.3" dur="5.46">job numbers stock market and</text>
  <text start="296.71" dur="4.09">statistically this is exactly what Trump</text>
  <text start="298.76" dur="5.22">wants remember he&amp;#39;s using the central</text>
  <text start="300.8" dur="4.53">bank system using all the tools against</text>
  <text start="303.98" dur="3.6">them against the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="305.33" dur="4.92">against the deep state he tweeted out</text>
  <text start="307.58" dur="6.06">the following stock market&amp;#39;s up record</text>
  <text start="310.25" dur="5.73">numbers for this year alone Dow up 18.65</text>
  <text start="313.64" dur="5.49">percent SP up twenty four point three</text>
  <text start="315.98" dur="5.34">six percent Nasdaq Composite up twenty</text>
  <text start="319.13" dur="5.76">nine point one seven percent it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="321.32" dur="5.76">economy stupid and he knows it he knows</text>
  <text start="324.89" dur="4.41">he needs to control the economic</text>
  <text start="327.08" dur="4.02">narrative and guess what Trump of the</text>
  <text start="329.3" dur="5.85">Patriots have done they are now</text>
  <text start="331.1" dur="6.72">controlling the narrative and it looks</text>
  <text start="335.15" dur="6.3">like China is going to waive some</text>
  <text start="337.82" dur="7.11">tariffs on some US soybeans pork in a</text>
  <text start="341.45" dur="8.13">goodwill gesture and as we can see over</text>
  <text start="344.93" dur="7.56">time the exports to China have increased</text>
  <text start="349.58" dur="7.2">and I do believe this is all part of</text>
  <text start="352.49" dur="6.84">phase one and I believe that Trump China</text>
  <text start="356.78" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;ll come to an understanding now</text>
  <text start="359.33" dur="5.34">remember the mission is not just to have</text>
  <text start="361.82" dur="5.94">a trade deal the mission is to move as</text>
  <text start="364.67" dur="5.58">many manufacturers out of China and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="367.76" dur="4.38">not against China itself it&amp;#39;s against</text>
  <text start="370.25" dur="3.69">the central bank system remember the</text>
  <text start="372.14" dur="4.65">central bank system was orchestrating</text>
  <text start="373.94" dur="6.09">all of this who was going to be the next</text>
  <text start="376.79" dur="5.42">country that was going to have maybe the</text>
  <text start="380.03" dur="5.07">reserve currency or control the system</text>
  <text start="382.21" dur="5.14">this is why everything was being moved</text>
  <text start="385.1" dur="5.01">out of the United States and moved into</text>
  <text start="387.35" dur="6.54">China Trump right now is putting a lot</text>
  <text start="390.11" dur="5.91">of pressure on the central bankers and</text>
  <text start="393.89" dur="4.62">this is why we had Kissinger this is why</text>
  <text start="396.02" dur="4.65">we had the IMF saying listen if you</text>
  <text start="398.51" dur="3.57">don&amp;#39;t make a deal with China the whole</text>
  <text start="400.67" dur="4.05">system is gonna fall apart is gonna be</text>
  <text start="402.08" dur="5.28">worse than World War one no their system</text>
  <text start="404.72" dur="5.16">is going to fall to fall apart that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="407.36" dur="4.26">what they&amp;#39;re talking about everything</text>
  <text start="409.88" dur="5.97">that they established over the many many</text>
  <text start="411.62" dur="7.14">years their entire globalist system will</text>
  <text start="415.85" dur="6.56">fall apart that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re worried</text>
  <text start="418.76" dur="7.35">about now when we look at manufacturing</text>
  <text start="422.41" dur="5.86">Trump has been doing a fantastic job</text>
  <text start="426.11" dur="6.51">bringing back as many manufacturers as</text>
  <text start="428.27" dur="6">possible Trump has added 348 thousand</text>
  <text start="432.62" dur="2.42">manufacturing jobs since Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="434.27" dur="4.44">election</text>
  <text start="435.04" dur="6.42">those include 263,000 durable goods</text>
  <text start="438.71" dur="5.04">manufacturing jobs and one year ago</text>
  <text start="441.46" dur="4.03">durable good employment hit more than</text>
  <text start="443.75" dur="3.2">eight million for the first time since</text>
  <text start="445.49" dur="4.29">the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="446.95" dur="5.14">now Axios and many other mainstream</text>
  <text start="449.78" dur="4.95">media outlets are out there saying that</text>
  <text start="452.09" dur="7.07">the manufacturing Renaissance has come</text>
  <text start="454.73" dur="7.32">to a close well not exactly the</text>
  <text start="459.16" dur="6.49">government reported that the economy had</text>
  <text start="462.05" dur="6.15">added 54,000 jobs more than undoing the</text>
  <text start="465.65" dur="5.46">October drop total manufacturing jobs</text>
  <text start="468.2" dur="5.3">are up by 76,000 compared with a year</text>
  <text start="471.11" dur="4.67">ago over the last six months</text>
  <text start="473.5" dur="5.74">manufacturing employment is up nearly</text>
  <text start="475.78" dur="7.51">20,000 jobs and when you look at the</text>
  <text start="479.24" dur="6.56">graph of Obama when he was president up</text>
  <text start="483.29" dur="5.07">to the point where Trump was president</text>
  <text start="485.8" dur="3.25">manufacturing jobs were pretty much</text>
  <text start="488.36" dur="2.52">flatlined</text>
  <text start="489.05" dur="4.23">they bobbed up and down but pretty much</text>
  <text start="490.88" dur="6.51">there were flatline soon as Trump came</text>
  <text start="493.28" dur="6.71">into office and he had the tax cuts he</text>
  <text start="497.39" dur="4.38">reduced regulations all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="499.99" dur="4.15">manufacturers started to come back to</text>
  <text start="501.77" dur="4.32">the United States and I do believe he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="504.14" dur="5.22">gonna cut even more regulations he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="506.09" dur="5.81">gonna cut even more taxes because the</text>
  <text start="509.36" dur="5.55">plan is to bring back as many</text>
  <text start="511.9" dur="5.05">manufacturers as possible now once again</text>
  <text start="514.91" dur="4.319">like we said yesterday there&amp;#39;s just not</text>
  <text start="516.95" dur="5.19">enough time to do all of this this is</text>
  <text start="519.229" dur="4.771">why Trump is using the u.s. MCA this is</text>
  <text start="522.14" dur="5.37">why he wants to answer Pelosi and the</text>
  <text start="524" dur="6.81">house to pass it this way we can compete</text>
  <text start="527.51" dur="5.49">using Canada and Mexico all together</text>
  <text start="530.81" dur="4.86">with the United States we can compete</text>
  <text start="533" dur="6.33">with other countries I mean it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="535.67" dur="6.21">brilliant plan and over time while we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="539.33" dur="5.31">competing with these other countries we</text>
  <text start="541.88" dur="5.28">can slowly bring back the manufacturers</text>
  <text start="544.64" dur="5.91">remember what Trump is doing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="547.16" dur="6.6">preparing the entire economic system for</text>
  <text start="550.55" dur="6.05">a transition using the central bank</text>
  <text start="553.76" dur="5.94">system all tools against them right now</text>
  <text start="556.6" dur="5.96">statistics they look fantastic</text>
  <text start="559.7" dur="5.23">behind-the-scenes he&amp;#39;s rebuilding</text>
  <text start="562.56" dur="5.76">America he&amp;#39;ll be rebuilding the</text>
  <text start="564.93" dur="6.3">infrastructure now the central bank they</text>
  <text start="568.32" dur="3.9">have been trying to stop him remember</text>
  <text start="571.23" dur="2.85">they&amp;#39;re not just going to sit on the</text>
  <text start="572.22" dur="7.11">sidelines and say hey you know what we</text>
  <text start="574.08" dur="6.81">give Central Bank they play dirty and we</text>
  <text start="579.33" dur="5.15">know they&amp;#39;re not just gonna sit around</text>

  <text start="584.48" dur="6.4">brings manufacturers back brings America</text>
  <text start="588.75" dur="3.96">back to the way it was and then go after</text>
  <text start="590.88" dur="3.75">the central bank we know they&amp;#39;re just</text>

  <text start="594.63" dur="4.38">say hey what are we gonna do they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="596.79" dur="5.34">going to fight back just like the EU is</text>
  <text start="599.01" dur="4.86">fighting back with the UK they tried</text>
  <text start="602.13" dur="4.08">many times think about what they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="603.87" dur="5.67">when Trump came into office they were</text>
  <text start="606.21" dur="6.12">raising rates on purpose to shut down</text>
  <text start="609.54" dur="4.53">the system blame it on Trump when Trump</text>
  <text start="612.33" dur="3.71">took control of that the mainstream</text>
  <text start="614.07" dur="4.41">media went out of their way to</text>
  <text start="616.04" dur="5.74">continually put out the message that a</text>

  <text start="629.88" dur="6.54">is no longer going to cut rates that</text>
  <text start="632.49" dur="6.3">they&amp;#39;re done and we can see out of many</text>
  <text start="636.42" dur="5.58">mainstream media outlets they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="638.79" dur="5.04">the same story the Fed is super glued to</text>
  <text start="642" dur="4.59">its seat until after the election</text>
  <text start="643.83" dur="6.48">because they know and this is very</text>
  <text start="646.59" dur="5.6">important they know that if Trump gets</text>

  <text start="694.03" dur="4.74">don&amp;#39;t even have cash most people are</text>
  <text start="696.52" dur="5.25">living on credit and if you feel</text>
  <text start="698.77" dur="6.5">comfortable and confident to use credit</text>

  <text start="720.55" dur="1.8">believe the Patriots have a plan for</text>
  <text start="722.08" dur="3.36">this</text>
  <text start="722.35" dur="6.48">I do believe they&amp;#39;re gonna have to show</text>
  <text start="725.44" dur="6.59">there was some criminal intent with the</text>
  <text start="728.83" dur="5.1">Federal Reserve to nullify the debt I</text>
  <text start="732.03" dur="4.48">don&amp;#39;t think this is just about</text>
  <text start="733.93" dur="5.25">restructuring I think this is about</text>
  <text start="736.51" dur="5.28">removing the debt here in the United</text>
  <text start="739.18" dur="4.59">States it&amp;#39;s about destroying what they</text>
  <text start="741.79" dur="8.75">did and the only way to really do this</text>
  <text start="743.77" dur="9.69">is to show that the Fed was criminal and</text>
  <text start="750.54" dur="5.26">in they were not working within their</text>
  <text start="753.46" dur="4.74">mandate and the only way to do this is</text>
  <text start="755.8" dur="5.31">with an audit how do you get to the</text>
  <text start="758.2" dur="4.89">audit you need a crisis we have audit</text>
  <text start="761.11" dur="3.92">bills they&amp;#39;re waiting in the house we</text>
  <text start="763.09" dur="4.17">know that Trump would sign it actually</text>
  <text start="765.03" dur="5.37">he tweeted out before he was in</text>
  <text start="767.26" dur="6.06">president that we should audit the Fed</text>
  <text start="770.4" dur="6.79">we know that he will take that next step</text>
  <text start="773.32" dur="6.6">and I do believe the Fed is going to go</text>
  <text start="777.19" dur="7.74">through a structure change and this debt</text>
  <text start="779.92" dur="7.62">that we have most likely once everything</text>
  <text start="784.93" dur="7.02">is all said and done a lot of it is</text>
  <text start="787.54" dur="8.16">going to disappear and he has to do this</text>
  <text start="791.95" dur="7.38">to restart the system to reset it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="795.7" dur="5.52">almost like a bankruptcy where you say</text>
  <text start="799.33" dur="3.15">listen the company just has too much</text>

  <text start="807.7" dur="8.61">do they get rid of the debt pull the</text>
  <text start="812.02" dur="6.81">debt that they had it&amp;#39;s gone they reset</text>
  <text start="816.31" dur="5.22">the system and they&amp;#39;re allowed to</text>
  <text start="818.83" dur="4.59">proceed forward yes I know there&amp;#39;s inner</text>
  <text start="821.53" dur="3.6">workings to different types of</text>
  <text start="823.42" dur="2.82">bankruptcies and things like that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="825.13" dur="3.11">using a very simple</text>
  <text start="826.24" dur="4.8">sample it&amp;#39;s almost like a personal</text>
  <text start="828.24" dur="5.02">bankruptcy yes I know there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="831.04" dur="3.96">different personal bankruptcies but what</text>
  <text start="833.26" dur="4.35">happens here is let&amp;#39;s say you lose your</text>
  <text start="835" dur="5.64">job and you have to declare bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="837.61" dur="5.669">all the credit card debt everything that</text>
  <text start="840.64" dur="6.99">you had gone you have to give back all</text>

  <text start="847.63" dur="4.649">lot of people before they declare</text>
  <text start="849.85" dur="4.65">bankruptcy they start to purchase quite</text>
  <text start="852.279" dur="4.56">a bit because they understand how the</text>
  <text start="854.5" dur="5.82">system works remember Trump has gone</text>
  <text start="856.839" dur="5.401">through bankruptcy this is not something</text>
