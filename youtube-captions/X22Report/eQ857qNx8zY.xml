  <text start="176.15" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re also kind of jumping ship at</text>
  <text start="179.09" dur="4.56">this point because everyone is pretty</text>
  <text start="181.91" dur="3.14">much looking out for themselves each</text>
  <text start="183.65" dur="4.44">government is saying you know something</text>
  <text start="185.05" dur="4.3">we see what&amp;#39;s coming we understand it we</text>

  <text start="189.35" dur="3.78">government central bankers are trying to</text>
  <text start="190.76" dur="4.32">do they&amp;#39;re trying to provoke war to</text>
  <text start="193.13" dur="5.73">cover up the collapse of the dollar but</text>
  <text start="195.08" dur="6.54">we have to protect the country and we</text>
  <text start="198.86" dur="5.76">can see that each country is going going</text>
  <text start="201.62" dur="5.79">to pretty much protect themselves when</text>
  <text start="204.62" dur="7.86">things start falling apart and we see</text>
  <text start="207.41" dur="10.91">that Germany France Australia Italy all</text>
  <text start="212.48" dur="5.84">decided to join the Chinese</text>
  <text start="218.98" dur="5.38">infrastructure investment bank and we</text>
  <text start="222.47" dur="5.13">see Luxembourg also decided you know</text>
  <text start="224.36" dur="5.52">what we better do this also we see</text>
  <text start="227.6" dur="5.93">Switzerland is out there saying yeah</text>
  <text start="229.88" dur="5.88">we&amp;#39;re going to sign on to this bank also</text>
  <text start="233.53" dur="4.959">because they&amp;#39;re going to protect</text>
  <text start="235.76" dur="5.82">themselves from what is happening we</text>
  <text start="238.489" dur="8.191">understand that the Chinese you want and</text>
  <text start="241.58" dur="9.18">remember the IMF is now in talks with</text>
  <text start="246.68" dur="7.5">China to add their currency to the</text>
  <text start="250.76" dur="5.789">reserve status of currencies we</text>
  <text start="254.18" dur="6.059">understand that China has been making</text>
  <text start="256.549" dur="6.421">deals all around the world because we</text>
  <text start="260.239" dur="5.131">can see what is going on here the dollar</text>
  <text start="262.97" dur="4.68">is on its way out and this is why we see</text>
  <text start="265.37" dur="6.63">military operations all over the world</text>
  <text start="267.65" dur="6.48">and the brick system is on its way in</text>
  <text start="272" dur="5.28">and this is why they&amp;#39;re making economic</text>
  <text start="274.13" dur="6.509">deals all over the world instead of</text>
  <text start="277.28" dur="6.979">using their military and whenever a</text>
  <text start="280.639" dur="7.701">nation is trying to protect their dying</text>
  <text start="284.259" dur="7.991">currency they use military force</text>
  <text start="288.34" dur="8.23">everywhere just to keep it where it is</text>
  <text start="292.25" dur="7.889">until they can get a war started to</text>
  <text start="296.57" dur="8.43">cover up the entire thing and as these</text>
  <text start="300.139" dur="6.451">countries go down the tubes because the</text>
  <text start="305" dur="5.13">whole thing is falling apart I mean</text>
  <text start="306.59" dur="6.27">Europe is still falling apart the United</text>
  <text start="310.13" dur="5.759">States is falling apart everything is</text>
  <text start="312.86" dur="5.58">collapsing they implement more and more</text>
  <text start="315.889" dur="3.9">taxes this is quite evident with what</text>
  <text start="318.44" dur="4.13">the United States is doing and what</text>
  <text start="319.789" dur="5.94">Europe is doing one of the newest taxes</text>
  <text start="322.57" dur="5.469">that they&amp;#39;ve created is in Italy and it</text>
  <text start="325.729" dur="5.611">kind of sounds like a joke but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="328.039" dur="7.651">scary about this it&amp;#39;s serious Italy</text>
  <text start="331.34" dur="7.29">decided to implement a tax on shadows</text>
  <text start="335.69" dur="5.43">and I know when I first heard this I go</text>
  <text start="338.63" dur="5.19">oh this has to be a joke no way but an</text>
  <text start="341.12" dur="5.6">Italian newspaper Lego reports Storn</text>
  <text start="343.82" dur="5.67">store owners are now faced with the</text>
  <text start="346.72" dur="6.37">unfortunate proposition of paying taxes</text>
  <text start="349.49" dur="5.609">on shadows the rationale appears to go</text>
  <text start="353.09" dur="4.65">something like this if there is an</text>
  <text start="355.099" dur="8.281">awning that casts a shadow on public</text>
  <text start="357.74" dur="9.81">property you must pay taxes because you</text>
  <text start="363.38" dur="6">are using public property this is why</text>
  <text start="367.55" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;re seeing all of these ridiculous</text>
  <text start="369.38" dur="5.13">taxes because they&amp;#39;re trying to raise</text>
  <text start="370.97" dur="6.84">revenue to keep the system going as</text>
  <text start="374.51" dur="6.27">these countries continually implement</text>
  <text start="377.81" dur="5.7">austerity the people are not working</text>
  <text start="380.78" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re not bringing in revenue so they</text>
  <text start="383.51" dur="3.839">need to find revenue in other areas the</text>
  <text start="386.33" dur="4.74">United States is doing this with</text>
  <text start="387.349" dur="5.85">Obamacare with FATCA they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="391.07" dur="3.81">whatever they possibly can to try to</text>
  <text start="393.199" dur="5.311">bring in more and more revenue because</text>
  <text start="394.88" dur="5.46">as they continually pile on debt like</text>
  <text start="398.51" dur="2.83">the United States is doing like the</text>
  <text start="400.34" dur="5.41">European countries</text>
  <text start="401.34" dur="6.51">doing it cannot be sustained and we see</text>
  <text start="405.75" dur="5.31">that everything is really starting to</text>
  <text start="407.85" dur="8.28">fall apart now here in the United States</text>
  <text start="411.06" dur="7.41">we see that in Chicago there was a black</text>
  <text start="416.13" dur="5.73">site there where basically they violated</text>
  <text start="418.47" dur="5.49">every American right as they brought</text>
  <text start="421.86" dur="3.75">them into this black site they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="423.96" dur="4.56">allowed to call a lawyer they were</text>
  <text start="425.61" dur="5.49">detained and this is a complete</text>
  <text start="428.52" dur="6.54">violation and there were protests</text>
  <text start="431.1" dur="6.75">outside of home on square and we can see</text>
  <text start="435.06" dur="5.579">right now that Chicago Police Commander</text>
  <text start="437.85" dur="6.78">has resigned in the wake of home on</text>
  <text start="440.639" dur="5.731">square now he wouldn&amp;#39;t have resigned if</text>
  <text start="444.63" dur="6.45">they&amp;#39;re all on the up and up but you can</text>
  <text start="446.37" dur="7.65">see that this story was uh was out in</text>
  <text start="451.08" dur="4.35">the open now it&amp;#39;s out there people are</text>
  <text start="454.02" dur="5.13">looking into it people are protesting</text>
  <text start="455.43" dur="5.1">and as of right now Nicholas wrote to</text>
  <text start="459.15" dur="4.829">the chief of the Bureau of organized</text>
  <text start="460.53" dur="6.75">crime resigned because of what has been</text>
  <text start="463.979" dur="7.051">going on there because they are looking</text>
  <text start="467.28" dur="5.46">into it and I&amp;#39;m sure that this is not</text>
  <text start="471.03" dur="4.889">the only black site in the United States</text>
  <text start="472.74" dur="4.609">I&amp;#39;m sure they&amp;#39;re in the big cities we</text>
  <text start="475.919" dur="3.511">just don&amp;#39;t know about them yet and</text>
  <text start="477.349" dur="4.661">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="479.43" dur="6.54">going to see others pop up in all</text>
  <text start="482.01" dur="6.779">different places now out in the Arctic</text>
  <text start="485.97" dur="4.47">we understand that Russia is having</text>
  <text start="488.789" dur="4.261">drills in the Arctic there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="490.44" dur="4.56">petroleum out there it&amp;#39;s a strategic</text>
  <text start="493.05" dur="4.71">location and a lot of countries are</text>
  <text start="495" dur="4.53">going to be maneuvering into the Arctic</text>
  <text start="497.76" dur="4.26">and we see Canada they&amp;#39;re armed forces</text>
  <text start="499.53" dur="4.8">have started the nor x 2015 military</text>
  <text start="502.02" dur="4.619">exercises aimed at advancing Lee</text>
  <text start="504.33" dur="5.07">servicemen capabilities in the Arctic</text>
  <text start="506.639" dur="5.911">operations and we can see they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="509.4" dur="6.03">to continue to have these drills until</text>
  <text start="512.55" dur="5.669">March 30th and every single country is</text>
  <text start="515.43" dur="5.76">trying to get into this area because</text>
  <text start="518.219" dur="5.931">there&amp;#39;s a huge amount of oil natural</text>
  <text start="521.19" dur="7.2">resources and it is a strategic location</text>
  <text start="524.15" dur="5.47">for the upcoming war we see the United</text>
  <text start="528.39" dur="5.43">States is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="529.62" dur="5.73">deploying additional military assets and</text>
  <text start="533.82" dur="3.69">soldiers into</text>
  <text start="535.35" dur="5.82">South Korea the US military is sending</text>
  <text start="537.51" dur="5.79">it an additional 400 soldiers with</text>
  <text start="541.17" dur="5.34">multiple launch rocket systems to South</text>
  <text start="543.3" dur="4.8">Korea a battalion from the 20th field</text>
  <text start="546.51" dur="4.92">artillery brigade will be deployed in</text>
  <text start="548.1" dur="6.6">June for a ninth month rotation they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="551.43" dur="5.7">going to keep the missile system in</text>
  <text start="554.7" dur="4.59">South Korea they&amp;#39;re not going to take</text>
  <text start="557.13" dur="4.77">that out so as the soldiers rotate the</text>
  <text start="559.29" dur="4.71">military assets will stay there and</text>
  <text start="561.9" dur="4.02">we&amp;#39;re seeing this occur all throughout</text>
  <text start="564" dur="4.74">Europe they&amp;#39;re having all of these</text>
  <text start="565.92" dur="5.64">different drills in different countries</text>
  <text start="568.74" dur="7.53">and all of these military assets will</text>
  <text start="571.56" dur="6.42">stay in the country they use this method</text>
  <text start="576.27" dur="4.26">so people think are now they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="577.98" dur="3.84">having a drill but they never take the</text>
  <text start="580.53" dur="3.18">equipment out of there because they know</text>
  <text start="581.82" dur="5.22">eventually when they provoke this war</text>
  <text start="583.71" dur="6.96">they&amp;#39;re going to need it now in</text>
  <text start="587.04" dur="6.51">Afghanistan we understand that the troop</text>
  <text start="590.67" dur="5.25">removal process is slowing up and</text>
  <text start="593.55" dur="4.23">actually they&amp;#39;re going to add troops and</text>
  <text start="595.92" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;ve been doing this for quite a bit</text>
  <text start="597.78" dur="5.25">now because they got the bilateral</text>

  <text start="614.34" dur="3.3">Ghani is supposed to be visiting the</text>
  <text start="615.87" dur="3.03">United States and of course as he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="617.64" dur="2.73">coming to the United States he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="618.9" dur="3.48">that we need more troops in this area</text>
  <text start="620.37" dur="4.95">because the Islamic state is there and</text>

  <text start="625.32" dur="3.69">going to close all the bases they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="627.12" dur="4.17">actually keeping two of them now open</text>
  <text start="629.01" dur="4.14">and as time goes on they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="631.29" dur="4.05">open the other one the other one it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="633.15" dur="4.04">very slow process so people don&amp;#39;t catch</text>
  <text start="635.34" dur="4.29">on what&amp;#39;s really going on here and</text>
  <text start="637.19" dur="5.05">they&amp;#39;re never going to leave Afghanistan</text>

  <text start="706.68" dur="4.98">was a pickup and they had the wrong</text>
  <text start="709.23" dur="5.07">person and they let them go later on</text>
  <text start="711.66" dur="5.88">very interesting to see their tactics</text>
  <text start="714.3" dur="5.789">and what they&amp;#39;re doing now the LPR</text>
  <text start="717.54" dur="5.88">leader is saying listen this Minsk</text>

  <text start="731.339" dur="7.291">see that yes they are making strides to</text>
  <text start="735.39" dur="7.139">pretty much start the offensive once</text>
  <text start="738.63" dur="6.48">again Russia is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="742.529" dur="7.5">saying Kiev has violated the Minsk</text>

  <text start="761.52" dur="4.5">all they&amp;#39;re doing is taking their</text>
  <text start="764.07" dur="4.68">weapons back they&amp;#39;re moving them around</text>
  <text start="766.02" dur="5.939">and we can see they bring them right</text>
  <text start="768.75" dur="6.54">back to the contact line and we can see</text>
  <text start="771.959" dur="6.181">that there are videos showing the heavy</text>
  <text start="775.29" dur="6.57">weaponry of Ukraine army by the line of</text>
  <text start="778.14" dur="7.05">contact at Ukraine&amp;#39;s southeast and we</text>
  <text start="781.86" dur="7.56">can see that they&amp;#39;re getting ready for a</text>
  <text start="785.19" dur="7.05">major major offensive Kiev right now has</text>

  <text start="796.26" dur="4.76">the Ukrainian army is increasing troops</text>
  <text start="798.03" dur="5.08">along the whole line of contact in</text>
  <text start="801.02" dur="4.28">recent weeks the number of service</text>
  <text start="803.11" dur="3.599">of Ukraine&amp;#39;s Regular Army and the</text>
  <text start="805.3" dur="4.49">National Guard has considerably</text>
  <text start="806.709" dur="6.661">increased in the adjoining areas and</text>
  <text start="809.79" dur="5.739">they&amp;#39;re seeing weapons being supplied</text>
  <text start="813.37" dur="3.899">these are weapons they&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="815.529" dur="6.021">before so where are they getting them</text>
  <text start="817.269" dur="7.5">from it&amp;#39;s amazing it&amp;#39;s all happening</text>
  <text start="821.55" dur="5.289">right now they&amp;#39;re getting ready they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="824.769" dur="5.19">building up there using the Minsk</text>
  <text start="826.839" dur="6.211">agreement to get everything prepared for</text>
  <text start="829.959" dur="5.221">this major offensive now out in Yemen we</text>
  <text start="833.05" dur="3.33">understand the Yemeni people are taking</text>
  <text start="835.18" dur="2.94">back their government and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="836.38" dur="5.67">continually doing this we see about a</text>
  <text start="838.12" dur="7.23">hundred US military personnel these</text>
  <text start="842.05" dur="7.56">special forces commandos they evacuated</text>
  <text start="845.35" dur="6.33">the airbase in Yemen the troops left</text>
  <text start="849.61" dur="5.31">late Friday for an unknown destination</text>
  <text start="851.68" dur="4.98">and basically what&amp;#39;s happening is the</text>
  <text start="854.92" dur="4.65">government there has no power whatsoever</text>
  <text start="856.66" dur="6.96">the people have taken over the entire</text>
  <text start="859.57" dur="7.28">area and out of nowhere all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="863.62" dur="7.26">we&amp;#39;re seeing the Islamic state taking</text>
  <text start="866.85" dur="8.02">responsibility for the mosque explosion</text>
  <text start="870.88" dur="9.149">there and we see that now the Islamic</text>
  <text start="874.87" dur="7.829">state is in Yemen and it&amp;#39;s just amazing</text>
  <text start="880.029" dur="5.401">the timing is so perfect and as we know</text>
  <text start="882.699" dur="5.521">the authorization for war allows the</text>
  <text start="885.43" dur="6.269">United States to go wherever the Islamic</text>
  <text start="888.22" dur="5.549">state is and Washington is out there</text>
  <text start="891.699" dur="4.861">because as we know the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="893.769" dur="5.221">in Libya and Washington before we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="896.56" dur="5.279">saying well we don&amp;#39;t really know if they</text>
  <text start="898.99" dur="4.92">really have a stronghold in Libya but as</text>
  <text start="901.839" dur="4.44">they were selling the people of Libya</text>
  <text start="903.91" dur="4.98">selling the oil not using the US dollar</text>
  <text start="906.279" dur="5.791">we see the story out of Washington is</text>
  <text start="908.89" dur="5.699">now changing Washington is voicing</text>
  <text start="912.07" dur="4.889">strong concerns over the growing</text>
  <text start="914.589" dur="3.901">influence of the Islamic state in the</text>
  <text start="916.959" dur="3.841">country the US State Department is that</text>
  <text start="918.49" dur="4.409">between a thousand to three thousand</text>
  <text start="920.8" dur="5.43">militants in Libya are now fighting for</text>
  <text start="922.899" dur="6.81">the Islamic state and of course the</text>
  <text start="926.23" dur="6.51">Islamic state trained those people who</text>
  <text start="929.709" dur="6.391">blew up who I mean who had the gun</text>
  <text start="932.74" dur="3.96">battle in Tunisia they came right out of</text>
  <text start="936.1" dur="3.42">Libya</text>
  <text start="936.7" dur="6.09">yeah and we can see they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="939.52" dur="5.31">ready for a major offensive in Libya</text>
  <text start="942.79" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re having the puppet government in</text>
  <text start="944.83" dur="6.09">whatever&amp;#39;s left of their armed forces</text>
  <text start="946.66" dur="7.91">fire and fly into Tripoli to get rid of</text>
  <text start="950.92" dur="7.38">the people and the new government and</text>
  <text start="954.57" dur="7.15">this is all being done right now because</text>
  <text start="958.3" dur="7.16">they can&amp;#39;t have the people sell the oil</text>
  <text start="961.72" dur="6.78">using the natural using the dollar and</text>
  <text start="965.46" dur="6.34">this is why we see the European</text>
  <text start="968.5" dur="6.27">countries like England France saying</text>
  <text start="971.8" dur="5.85">listen we will stop any tanker that</text>
  <text start="974.77" dur="6.39">leaves the Libyan area and we will bring</text>
  <text start="977.65" dur="6.24">it back to port they will not let this</text>
  <text start="981.16" dur="5.37">happen I mean we think back when the</text>
  <text start="983.89" dur="4.74">Navy SEALs dropped out jumped on to that</text>
  <text start="986.53" dur="3.39">tanker that left the Libyan port and</text>
  <text start="988.63" dur="4.47">they brought it right back because they</text>
  <text start="989.92" dur="5.43">were sailing out to sell this oil not</text>
  <text start="993.1" dur="6.39">using the dollar and I have to say once</text>
  <text start="995.35" dur="7.17">this does occur other countries will not</text>
  <text start="999.49" dur="5.91">need to keep the dollar in reserves if</text>
  <text start="1002.52" dur="5.07">they don&amp;#39;t keep the dollar they can send</text>
  <text start="1005.4" dur="4.02">back to the United States as the dollar</text>
  <text start="1007.59" dur="3.78">comes back the United States there are</text>
  <text start="1009.42" dur="4.14">more dollars in circulation if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1011.37" dur="4.83">more dollars in circulations we see</text>
  <text start="1013.56" dur="5.04">inflation or the devaluation of the</text>
  <text start="1016.2" dur="4.5">dollar and this is what we are going to</text>
  <text start="1018.6" dur="3.78">see because they are completely losing</text>
  <text start="1020.7" dur="4.139">control and they want this authorization</text>
  <text start="1022.38" dur="4.98">of war passed so they can go after all</text>
  <text start="1024.839" dur="3.721">these people now as we know we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1027.36" dur="6.93">reporting that the United States</text>
  <text start="1028.56" dur="9.99">government central bankers they use the</text>
  <text start="1034.29" dur="8.21">Islamic state as a proxy army along with</text>
  <text start="1038.55" dur="7.83">UK Israel and other countries and Iraq</text>
  <text start="1042.5" dur="5.8">has shown photographs videos of us</text>
  <text start="1046.38" dur="3.3">planes dropping the supplies and they</text>
  <text start="1048.3" dur="5.7">keep saying it&amp;#39;s a mistake it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1049.68" dur="6.12">mistake Iraq also wiretapped the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1054" dur="3.75">state and they picked up the</text>
  <text start="1055.8" dur="5.52">communications between the United States</text>
  <text start="1057.75" dur="7.44">and Iraq well there is more evidence out</text>
  <text start="1061.32" dur="8.31">there right now we also see US Special</text>
  <text start="1065.19" dur="7.71">Forces they are in Syria there</text>
  <text start="1069.63" dur="6">in kobane II troops are guiding us</text>
  <text start="1072.9" dur="5.55">airstrikes as part of us support for the</text>
  <text start="1075.63" dur="5.4">Kurdish separatist group a photo was</text>
  <text start="1078.45" dur="5.28">taken which shows three US soldiers one</text>
  <text start="1081.03" dur="4.74">of them Peter is carrying a bushnell</text>
  <text start="1083.73" dur="6.42">laser rangefinder and instrument</text>
  <text start="1085.77" dur="6.44">designed to mark targets for us jets we</text>
  <text start="1090.15" dur="5.7">can see right now this is all being done</text>
  <text start="1092.21" dur="8.17">to go after Assad it makes no sense that</text>
  <text start="1095.85" dur="8.43">the United States the UK Australia and</text>
  <text start="1100.38" dur="7.98">other countries which with incredible</text>
  <text start="1104.28" dur="6.99">technology and the ability to bomb the</text>
  <text start="1108.36" dur="5.01">area the Islamic state was able to</text>
  <text start="1111.27" dur="4.65">expand their area and Syria for three</text>
  <text start="1113.37" dur="5.13">times from when they started bombing the</text>
  <text start="1115.92" dur="5.6">area it makes no sense what does make</text>
  <text start="1118.5" dur="7.14">sense is they&amp;#39;re clearing the path</text>
  <text start="1121.52" dur="8.74">making it easier for the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1125.64" dur="8.4">the Free Syrian Army the US troops to go</text>
  <text start="1130.26" dur="8.3">after Assad because they&amp;#39;ve maintained</text>
  <text start="1134.04" dur="6.96">control over that entire region and</text>
  <text start="1138.56" dur="4.93">things are really starting to heat up</text>
  <text start="1141" dur="7.34">around the world we understand that</text>
  <text start="1143.49" dur="9.81">Putin with other nations like Kyrgyzstan</text>
  <text start="1148.34" dur="8.47">Armenia Uzbekistan they started the</text>
  <text start="1153.3" dur="6.48">Eurasian Union and right now Washington</text>
  <text start="1156.81" dur="5.25">has sent Victoria Nuland to Armenia to</text>
  <text start="1159.78" dur="5.34">organize a color revolution or a coup</text>
  <text start="1162.06" dur="5.54">there Richard miles as ambassador to</text>

  <text start="1171.44" dur="5.41">Uzbekistan to purchase that governments</text>
  <text start="1174.45" dur="4.17">allegiance away from Russia the result</text>
  <text start="1176.85" dur="4.2">would be a break up the collective</text>
  <text start="1178.62" dur="4.83">security treaty organization and present</text>
  <text start="1181.05" dur="4.86">Russia and China with destabilization</text>
  <text start="1183.45" dur="5.34">where they can least afford it remember</text>
  <text start="1185.91" dur="4.71">all these countries are part of the</text>
  <text start="1188.79" dur="5.39">Eurasian Union they signed on at</text>

  <text start="1213.74" dur="8.319">Argentina because they understand they</text>
  <text start="1218.1" dur="6.15">need to stop this system the system that</text>
  <text start="1222.059" dur="4.431">is not aligned with the private western</text>
  <text start="1224.25" dur="4.74">central bank system and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="1226.49" dur="5.169">what they&amp;#39;re doing at this point because</text>
  <text start="1228.99" dur="5.13">you have to remember all those countries</text>
  <text start="1231.659" dur="4.951">that do not go along with the private</text>

  <text start="1248.58" dur="5.79">war is provoked by the end of this year</text>
  <text start="1251.07" dur="4.739">or the beginning of next year because it</text>
  <text start="1254.37" dur="4.08">seems like they&amp;#39;re trying harder and</text>
  <text start="1255.809" dur="5.011">harder to do this because of all other</text>
  <text start="1258.45" dur="3.809">methods fail they will push it as hard</text>
