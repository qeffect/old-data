  <text start="67.159" dur="4.771">the Middle East breaking down the plan</text>
  <text start="69.369" dur="5.591">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="71.93" dur="4.59">political and geopolitical news now it</text>
  <text start="74.96" dur="4.38">seems like everything is completely</text>
  <text start="76.52" dur="5.22">going wrong for the deep state and more</text>
  <text start="79.34" dur="4.5">information is being brought up more</text>
  <text start="81.74" dur="4.89">information is coming out about what</text>
  <text start="83.84" dur="6.479">they&amp;#39;ve done and the walls are closing</text>
  <text start="86.63" dur="5.43">in around them McCain finally omits he</text>
  <text start="90.319" dur="4.141">is the source that gave former FBI</text>
  <text start="92.06" dur="5.61">director James Comey the unverified</text>
  <text start="94.46" dur="4.949">dossier which we kind of knew because we</text>
  <text start="97.67" dur="4.589">pretty much mapped it out in Prior</text>
  <text start="99.409" dur="4.531">reports but he&amp;#39;s out there saying that</text>
  <text start="102.259" dur="4.351">yes he was the one who did it</text>
  <text start="103.94" dur="5.789">we also see that judicial watch</text>
  <text start="106.61" dur="6.24">uncovered emails that revealed that</text>
  <text start="109.729" dur="5.31">James Comey coordinated his June 8th</text>
  <text start="112.85" dur="4.259">2017 testimony in front of the Senate</text>
  <text start="115.039" dur="6.18">Intel committee with Special Counsel</text>
  <text start="117.109" dur="6.12">Robert Mueller so as we can see all</text>
  <text start="121.219" dur="4.711">these things are starting to come out</text>
  <text start="123.229" dur="5.491">and things are not going that well for</text>
  <text start="125.93" dur="5.1">the deep state we see North Korea for</text>
  <text start="128.72" dur="4.62">instance those peace deals are moving</text>
  <text start="131.03" dur="4.38">forward Trump was able to get hostages</text>
  <text start="133.34" dur="5.22">released we see right now that Trump</text>
  <text start="135.41" dur="5.04">basically tweeted out that the summit is</text>
  <text start="138.56" dur="4.53">going to be held in Singapore on June</text>
  <text start="140.45" dur="5.28">12th and like I said before we need to</text>
  <text start="143.09" dur="4.649">keep our eyes open because I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="145.73" dur="4.08">surprised if the deep State try</text>
  <text start="147.739" dur="4.831">something in this area maybe there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="149.81" dur="5.16">bombing maybe something happens where</text>
  <text start="152.57" dur="4.86">they can&amp;#39;t have the summit or maybe</text>
  <text start="154.97" dur="5.34">something happens while they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="157.43" dur="5.55">the summit but again I would not count</text>
  <text start="160.31" dur="5.009">the deep state out just yet because we</text>
  <text start="162.98" dur="5.339">can see they&amp;#39;re getting ready to push</text>
  <text start="165.319" dur="5.07">events like we&amp;#39;ve never seen before we</text>
  <text start="168.319" dur="4.741">see right now at the US Treasury since</text>
  <text start="170.389" dur="6.57">Trump has pretty much nixed the Iranian</text>
  <text start="173.06" dur="6.209">deal they have now placed sanctions on</text>
  <text start="176.959" dur="4.17">Iran they blacklisted six individuals</text>
  <text start="179.269" dur="3.991">and we&amp;#39;ve seen this before</text>
  <text start="181.129" dur="5.101">we&amp;#39;ve seen this with North Korea as</text>
  <text start="183.26" dur="5.729">North Korea continually tested their MS</text>
  <text start="186.23" dur="4.74">systems their nuclear systems they</text>
  <text start="188.989" dur="3.121">continually place sanctions on the</text>
  <text start="190.97" dur="3.45">country and we know that sanctions</text>
  <text start="192.11" dur="4.92">really don&amp;#39;t work these countries are</text>
  <text start="194.42" dur="5.099">able to survive over the many many years</text>
  <text start="197.03" dur="3.84">with sanctions so they really don&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="199.519" dur="4.621">anything but what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="200.87" dur="6.929">is that Europe they&amp;#39;re trying to keep</text>
  <text start="204.14" dur="6.06">the deal together and Merkel right now</text>
  <text start="207.799" dur="3.27">says Europe can no longer rely on the US</text>
  <text start="210.2" dur="3.42">to protect it</text>
  <text start="211.069" dur="4.441">Makran is running around saying we need</text>
  <text start="213.62" dur="4.47">to keep this deal together will work</text>
  <text start="215.51" dur="5.28">with Iran will work with anyone we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="218.09" dur="4.289">let this deal die and they&amp;#39;re very very</text>
  <text start="220.79" dur="5.1">worried about this deal and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="222.379" dur="6.571">about Iran creating nuclear weapons it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="225.89" dur="4.56">not about keeping peace in the region</text>
  <text start="228.95" dur="3.81">because we know they don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="230.45" dur="5.849">peace I mean look at Lebanon look at</text>
  <text start="232.76" dur="5.91">Syria look at Iraq look at Sudan look at</text>
  <text start="236.299" dur="3.78">Ukraine they were all part of this so</text>
  <text start="238.67" dur="4.83">they really don&amp;#39;t care about that</text>
  <text start="240.079" dur="6.181">they&amp;#39;re worried about what will happen</text>
  <text start="243.5" dur="6.54">if the world finds out what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="246.26" dur="6.33">doing with this deal the slush funds the</text>
  <text start="250.04" dur="5.15">uranium that&amp;#39;s being smuggled in what</text>
  <text start="252.59" dur="5.489">they&amp;#39;ve been doing all this time now</text>
  <text start="255.19" dur="4.63">Israel is saying that Iran has crossed</text>
  <text start="258.079" dur="3.69">the red line now this is deep state</text>
  <text start="259.82" dur="3.36">speak this is what the deep state</text>
  <text start="261.769" dur="3.841">usually uses you know you&amp;#39;re crossing</text>
  <text start="263.18" dur="4.919">red lines and they see black and white</text>
  <text start="265.61" dur="4.16">and that&amp;#39;s all they see and basically</text>
  <text start="268.099" dur="4.711">Iran is sitting here like okay you</text>
  <text start="269.77" dur="5.769">cancelled the deal and you&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="272.81" dur="6.329">say we cross the red line what are you</text>
  <text start="275.539" dur="6.771">talking about so basically Israel is</text>
  <text start="279.139" dur="6.691">saying that Iran fired missiles at</text>
  <text start="282.31" dur="5.38">Israel and Iran is out there saying yeah</text>
  <text start="285.83" dur="4.5">this is a false flag we did no such</text>
  <text start="287.69" dur="4.289">thing whatsoever and normally what</text>
  <text start="290.33" dur="4.8">Israel does to create these false flags</text>
  <text start="291.979" dur="6.391">is they fire missiles back into Israel</text>
  <text start="295.13" dur="5.19">and the missiles never hit anything they</text>
  <text start="298.37" dur="2.609">always land far off in the desert or</text>
  <text start="300.32" dur="3.36">something like that</text>
  <text start="300.979" dur="3.631">and they&amp;#39;re really noting that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="303.68" dur="4.169">no damage ever</text>
  <text start="304.61" dur="7.17">nothing is ever hit and again why would</text>
  <text start="307.849" dur="6.241">I ran wanna attack Israel right now it</text>
  <text start="311.78" dur="5.4">makes no sense especially when Iran</text>
  <text start="314.09" dur="5.67">hasn&amp;#39;t attacked anyone in 200 years to</text>
  <text start="317.18" dur="3.44">start a war it makes no sense that</text>
  <text start="319.76" dur="3.57">they would move in this direction</text>
  <text start="320.62" dur="4.51">because they know that the United States</text>
  <text start="323.33" dur="3.96">would join in and they would be</text>
  <text start="325.13" dur="4.17">obliterated so it makes no sense for</text>
  <text start="327.29" dur="3.84">them to start attacking especially when</text>
  <text start="329.3" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re trying to work out the deal with</text>
  <text start="331.13" dur="4.71">the European nations so this makes no</text>
  <text start="333.38" dur="5.55">sense whatsoever Russia is out there</text>
  <text start="335.84" dur="6.27">saying listen Israel and Iran they must</text>
  <text start="338.93" dur="4.77">show restraint and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="342.11" dur="4.17">coming in saying listen we need to have</text>
  <text start="343.7" dur="4.92">peace let&amp;#39;s calm the situation down and</text>
  <text start="346.28" dur="4.41">we need to understand what has happened</text>
  <text start="348.62" dur="4.14">here because Israel is saying that you</text>
  <text start="350.69" dur="3.96">know they fired missiles and this is why</text>
  <text start="352.76" dur="4.41">we fired missiles back at the Iranian</text>
  <text start="354.65" dur="3.93">bases the Iranians are saying we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="357.17" dur="2.94">have bases there so I don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="358.58" dur="3.9">you&amp;#39;re talking about Syria is out there</text>
  <text start="360.11" dur="5.28">saying no you didn&amp;#39;t hit Iranian bases</text>
  <text start="362.48" dur="4.65">you&amp;#39;re hitting the Syrian army so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="365.39" dur="4.23">break this down a little bit to see</text>
  <text start="367.13" dur="4.05">what&amp;#39;s really going on here at least 20</text>
  <text start="369.62" dur="3.75">rockets were launched from southern</text>
  <text start="371.18" dur="3.87">Syria at positions of the Israeli</text>
  <text start="373.37" dur="4.11">military in the Golan Heights the</text>
  <text start="375.05" dur="3.89">Rockets they were reportedly aimed at</text>
  <text start="377.48" dur="4.41">the following Israeli targets</text>
  <text start="378.94" dur="5.17">headquarters of the border Brigade 9,900</text>
  <text start="381.89" dur="4.83">headquarters of the border Brigade 8:10</text>
  <text start="384.11" dur="5.82">a technical and electronic survey</text>
  <text start="386.72" dur="5.46">facility headquarters of the e-w jamming</text>
  <text start="389.93" dur="5.52">facility communication and transmission</text>
  <text start="392.18" dur="6.12">facility helicopters airfield outpost at</text>
  <text start="395.45" dur="5.15">Hermon mount and another unit</text>
  <text start="398.3" dur="6.09">headquarters that was supposedly</text>
  <text start="400.6" dur="6.07">targeted not one got hit now they have</text>
  <text start="404.39" dur="6.27">pictures out there showing missiles and</text>
  <text start="406.67" dur="7.23">stuff like that showing there is bases</text>
  <text start="410.66" dur="6">or certain areas that were being hit by</text>
  <text start="413.9" dur="4.17">the Syrian missiles and if you look at</text>
  <text start="416.66" dur="4.74">the pictures and you go back in time</text>
  <text start="418.07" dur="7.74">they&amp;#39;re not from today or yesterday</text>
  <text start="421.4" dur="6.27">they&amp;#39;re from 2016 so already we can see</text>
  <text start="425.81" dur="5.16">that the pictures that are being moved</text>
  <text start="427.67" dur="8.31">around about Israel getting hit in this</text>
  <text start="430.97" dur="7.59">area it&amp;#39;s not true now again Syria is</text>
  <text start="435.98" dur="5.04">saying that the missiles that were fired</text>
  <text start="438.56" dur="4.86">into their country most of them were</text>
  <text start="441.02" dur="5.01">intercepted and according to the Syrian</text>
  <text start="443.42" dur="5.22">state-run news agency the serene air</text>
  <text start="446.03" dur="4.86">defense forces intercepted about ten of</text>
  <text start="448.64" dur="3.63">the Israeli missiles preventing most of</text>
  <text start="450.89" dur="2.25">them from reaching their targets whoever</text>
  <text start="452.27" dur="3.06">part of the</text>
  <text start="453.14" dur="4.8">a number of air defense battalions</text>
  <text start="455.33" dur="3.9">radars and ammo Depot the Lebanese</text>
  <text start="457.94" dur="4.26">military said that four Israeli</text>
  <text start="459.23" dur="4.8">warplanes violated the Lebanese airspace</text>
  <text start="462.2" dur="3.81">at that&amp;#39;s at the same time when Israel</text>
  <text start="464.03" dur="5.79">was carrying out the strikes and Israel</text>
  <text start="466.01" dur="6.39">also targeted areas near Damascus the</text>
  <text start="469.82" dur="6.48">countryside there the province of Homs</text>
  <text start="472.4" dur="6.63">and basically the Syrian army have</text>
  <text start="476.3" dur="4.38">picked up these pieces of the missiles</text>
  <text start="479.03" dur="3.78">that they intercepted and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="480.68" dur="4.08">displaying them showing that yeah we</text>
  <text start="482.81" dur="3.9">intercepted these missiles now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="484.76" dur="5.19">very interesting about this is that</text>
  <text start="486.71" dur="7.14">while Israel was firing these missiles</text>
  <text start="489.95" dur="6.87">at this fake Iranian base the moderate</text>
  <text start="493.85" dur="6.12">rebels the Syrian democratic forces took</text>
  <text start="496.82" dur="5.85">advantage of these missile attacks and</text>
  <text start="499.97" dur="4.68">they mounted an offensive now how did</text>
  <text start="502.67" dur="4.14">they know that this was coming and how</text>
  <text start="504.65" dur="4.89">are they prepared to mount an offense</text>
  <text start="506.81" dur="5.22">especially when these missiles were</text>
  <text start="509.54" dur="5.16">hitting Iranian bases or were they</text>
  <text start="512.03" dur="5.31">hitting the Syrian Armed Forces that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="514.7" dur="5.43">what they were really hitting so Israel</text>
  <text start="517.34" dur="6.09">is on a different agenda they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="520.13" dur="6.93">the Iranian deal to push their agenda</text>
  <text start="523.43" dur="5.25">and basically hit the goal they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="527.06" dur="4.53">always trying to hit in that is to</text>
  <text start="528.68" dur="4.94">remove Assad I mean they keep saying we</text>
  <text start="531.59" dur="4.08">want to get rid of Assad I mean other</text>
  <text start="533.62" dur="4.24">countries are saying yeah we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="535.67" dur="5.37">Assad to go we don&amp;#39;t care now it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="537.86" dur="6.42">too late but it seems like this is still</text>
  <text start="541.04" dur="6.21">part of the agenda now we need to</text>
  <text start="544.28" dur="6.21">remember the deep state they don&amp;#39;t give</text>
  <text start="547.25" dur="5.94">up they always try to reach their goal</text>
  <text start="550.49" dur="4.2">and we know that the economic system is</text>
  <text start="553.19" dur="5.88">completely falling apart we know the</text>
  <text start="554.69" dur="6.48">central bankers they need an excuse to</text>
  <text start="559.07" dur="5.07">say that a country brought down the</text>
  <text start="561.17" dur="4.29">financial institutions or an individual</text>
  <text start="564.14" dur="2.79">brought down the institution&amp;#39;s they need</text>
  <text start="565.46" dur="3.9">someone to blame and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="566.93" dur="4.83">interesting is since Trump canceled the</text>
  <text start="569.36" dur="3.99">Iranian deal we see that the deep state</text>
  <text start="571.76" dur="4.59">is kind of taken advantage of this and</text>
  <text start="573.35" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re making their moves now again is</text>
  <text start="576.35" dur="4.41">this a trap that has been set</text>
  <text start="578.39" dur="5.94">maybe but what&amp;#39;s coming out of this is</text>
  <text start="580.76" dur="5.739">that they&amp;#39;re saying that Iran is likely</text>
  <text start="584.33" dur="4.419">to launch cyber attacks on</text>
  <text start="586.499" dur="4.44">Western businesses within months and</text>
  <text start="588.749" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re gonna hit financial services</text>
  <text start="590.939" dur="5.28">critical infrastructure providers energy</text>
  <text start="594.029" dur="4.35">companies along with government</text>
  <text start="596.219" dur="5.19">departments so it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="598.379" dur="5.94">building the case once again that Iran</text>
  <text start="601.409" dur="5.7">is going to be responsible for basically</text>
  <text start="604.319" dur="5.22">the destruction of the economy now if we</text>
  <text start="607.109" dur="4.62">go back in time weren&amp;#39;t they saying the</text>
  <text start="609.539" dur="4.56">same thing about North Korea that they</text>
  <text start="611.729" dur="4.29">were preparing to use cyberattacks</text>
  <text start="614.099" dur="3.72">against the financial institutions it</text>
  <text start="616.019" dur="4.86">seems like they&amp;#39;re doing the same exact</text>
  <text start="617.819" dur="7.59">thing now queue dropped some more Intel</text>
  <text start="620.879" dur="8.43">post 3 1 3 2 3 May 9th and basically put</text>
  <text start="625.409" dur="7.05">up this article about Raza Tom and Raza</text>
  <text start="629.309" dur="5.88">Tom basically is a Russian nuclear</text>
  <text start="632.459" dur="6.27">company and they were contracted by Iran</text>
  <text start="635.189" dur="5.73">to build nuclear reactors and what do we</text>
  <text start="638.729" dur="4.29">know about Rosa Tom well we know that</text>
  <text start="640.919" dur="4.32">Raza Tom is the Russian link to uranium</text>
  <text start="643.019" dur="4.5">one we know uranium one involves</text>
  <text start="645.239" dur="4.08">treasonous action by a deep state the</text>
  <text start="647.519" dur="5.25">Cabal to make money and to divert</text>
  <text start="649.319" dur="5.22">American product towards their agenda we</text>
  <text start="652.769" dur="3.69">know the Iran deal can be assumed as</text>
  <text start="654.539" dur="3.78">hush money to the Iranians to keep their</text>

  <text start="765.089" dur="5.821">about this uranium one deal the NRC in</text>
  <text start="768.089" dur="5.821">2012 authorized an amendment to an</text>

  <text start="787.199" dur="6.351">the deals that Clinton Obama made and</text>
  <text start="790.89" dur="7.53">this is why all this money was kept</text>
  <text start="793.55" dur="8.07">secret if to keep Iran quiet to keep all</text>
  <text start="798.42" dur="7.89">the players happy and basically</text>
  <text start="801.62" dur="6.85">eventually use this to blame the war on</text>
  <text start="806.31" dur="4.41">Russia that they used a nuclear device</text>
  <text start="808.47" dur="5.309">and this is what they&amp;#39;ve been trying to</text>
  <text start="810.72" dur="3.54">do now let&amp;#39;s talk about what is going on</text>
  <text start="813.779" dur="2.971">here</text>
  <text start="814.26" dur="5.28">because everyone is talking about war</text>
  <text start="816.75" dur="4.86">and if we do enter war World War three</text>
  <text start="819.54" dur="4.5">like everyone is talking about it&amp;#39;s game</text>
  <text start="821.61" dur="5.849">over anyhow and everyone was talking</text>
  <text start="824.04" dur="4.83">about war with North Korea and we</text>
  <text start="827.459" dur="4.5">actually have peace now</text>
  <text start="828.87" dur="4.8">so let&amp;#39;s look at this plan and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="831.959" dur="3.721">supposed to trust the plan according to</text>
  <text start="833.67" dur="4.74">q let&amp;#39;s look at what is happening right</text>
  <text start="835.68" dur="5.88">now the United States said we are no</text>
  <text start="838.41" dur="6.299">longer going to be included in this</text>
  <text start="841.56" dur="5.79">Iranian deal because Q has said many</text>
  <text start="844.709" dur="5.37">many times that there are players within</text>
  <text start="847.35" dur="5.46">this deal that have been funneling money</text>
  <text start="850.079" dur="3.841">have funneling uranium it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="852.81" dur="3.719">connected</text>
  <text start="853.92" dur="4.94">during money keeping the Iranians quiet</text>
  <text start="856.529" dur="5.941">because they&amp;#39;re receiving the funds and</text>
  <text start="858.86" dur="5.02">basically Q is saying that now since the</text>
  <text start="862.47" dur="3.69">funding isn&amp;#39;t happening</text>
  <text start="863.88" dur="5.22">Iran is free they can speak freely</text>
  <text start="866.16" dur="6.539">because they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re not being held</text>
  <text start="869.1" dur="5.82">by this agreement now basically we knew</text>
  <text start="872.699" dur="3.841">once this happened the deep state was</text>
  <text start="874.92" dur="3.51">gonna go crazy they&amp;#39;re gonna run around</text>
  <text start="876.54" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re gonna visit Trump they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="878.43" dur="3.57">try to make the deal because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="880.32" dur="4.8">want anything coming out from this area</text>
  <text start="882" dur="5.519">so while this is happening we have</text>
  <text start="885.12" dur="4.469">Israel now and they&amp;#39;re pushing their</text>
  <text start="887.519" dur="4.081">events in Syria blaming it all on Iran</text>
  <text start="889.589" dur="4.231">now their motive I think is completely</text>
  <text start="891.6" dur="5.099">different than what Trump is trying to</text>
  <text start="893.82" dur="5.009">do Israel is still under the push of</text>
  <text start="896.699" dur="4.621">getting rid of Assad moving into Syria</text>
  <text start="898.829" dur="4.26">then eventually going to Iran and we</text>
  <text start="901.32" dur="5.879">have to think back a little bit because</text>
  <text start="903.089" dur="6.961">Russia did say listen if these attacks</text>
  <text start="907.199" dur="6.51">keep up by Israel we&amp;#39;re going to give</text>
  <text start="910.05" dur="5.46">Syria the s-300 missile system and we</text>
  <text start="913.709" dur="3.721">might even gift it to them they might we</text>
  <text start="915.51" dur="3.509">might we might not even let them pay for</text>
  <text start="917.43" dur="3.63">it we might just give it to them and</text>
  <text start="919.019" dur="4.201">this will be for the whole southern area</text>
  <text start="921.06" dur="5.16">and I believe this why Netanyahu went up</text>
  <text start="923.22" dur="6.35">to Putin many many times before to talk</text>
  <text start="926.22" dur="6.57">him out of it and I think right now with</text>
  <text start="929.57" dur="5.17">Israel using the excuse of this Iranian</text>
  <text start="932.79" dur="3.09">deal to attack Syria which makes no</text>
  <text start="934.74" dur="3.63">sense saying that they&amp;#39;re attacking</text>
  <text start="935.88" dur="4.47">Iranian bases which still makes no sense</text>
  <text start="938.37" dur="3.69">because Iran is saying well we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="940.35" dur="3.15">have bases there and Syria is saying</text>
  <text start="942.06" dur="3.36">well you&amp;#39;re not hitting bases you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="943.5" dur="3.899">hitting our armed forces and then the</text>
  <text start="945.42" dur="4.169">moderate rebels they mounted an</text>
  <text start="947.399" dur="4.951">offensive at the same exact time do you</text>
  <text start="949.589" dur="6.81">think this will now push Russia into</text>
  <text start="952.35" dur="7.29">giving Syria the s-300 missile system to</text>
  <text start="956.399" dur="5.491">protect the southern area I I do I do</text>
  <text start="959.64" dur="5.79">believe this I believe this was a</text>
  <text start="961.89" dur="6.03">calculated move and I think Trump wanted</text>
  <text start="965.43" dur="5.399">Russia to bring this missile system in</text>
  <text start="967.92" dur="6.599">to protect the southern area of Syria to</text>
  <text start="970.829" dur="7.38">block Israel to shut down the push into</text>
  <text start="974.519" dur="6.331">Syria now remember if Iran is the</text>
  <text start="978.209" dur="6.24">problem why isn&amp;#39;t Israel and the United</text>
  <text start="980.85" dur="6.81">States attacking Iran well they have the</text>
  <text start="984.449" dur="5.551">Russian missile system and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="987.66" dur="4.2">fully functional and it&amp;#39;s protecting</text>
  <text start="990" dur="4.83">their airspace so they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="991.86" dur="5.22">fire at Iran that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="994.83" dur="4.17">Syria and I believe this was part of the</text>
  <text start="997.08" dur="4.47">plan now the other part of the plan is</text>
  <text start="999" dur="4.77">to expose the deep state on how the</text>
  <text start="1001.55" dur="4.32">uranium deal was delivered and used to</text>
  <text start="1003.77" dur="3.86">set up Russia and how the money was</text>
  <text start="1005.87" dur="4.41">funneled and things like that and</text>
  <text start="1007.63" dur="6.67">basically what this is doing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1010.28" dur="7.2">allowing Iran to speak freely now again</text>
  <text start="1014.3" dur="7.38">if Europe comes together and actually</text>
  <text start="1017.48" dur="7.29">ends up paying Iran with the deal then</text>
  <text start="1021.68" dur="5.88">Trump lost his calculated move didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1024.77" dur="5.73">work because now Iran stays quiet do you</text>
  <text start="1027.56" dur="5.19">really think at this point Europe is so</text>
  <text start="1030.5" dur="4.89">together that they&amp;#39;re gonna work on this</text>
  <text start="1032.75" dur="4.439">together to keep Iran silent I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1035.39" dur="4.62">think so and I think what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1037.189" dur="5.52">happen is that Russia is going to give</text>
  <text start="1040.01" dur="4.74">the s-300 missile system to block the</text>
  <text start="1042.709" dur="3.99">attack from the southern area because</text>
  <text start="1044.75" dur="4.29">that was the only area that was kind of</text>
  <text start="1046.699" dur="4.471">open they pretty much have the northern</text>
  <text start="1049.04" dur="4.77">area the mid section of Syria pretty</text>
  <text start="1051.17" dur="4.71">much locked down and we see right now</text>
  <text start="1053.81" dur="3.6">that they need to lock down some more</text>
  <text start="1055.88" dur="4.74">now I think this is all in preparation</text>
  <text start="1057.41" dur="4.77">to bring the troops home eventually but</text>
  <text start="1060.62" dur="4.35">certain things had to happen</text>
  <text start="1062.18" dur="5.1">and by bringing the troops home you</text>
  <text start="1064.97" dur="4.5">needed to expose what was going on and</text>
  <text start="1067.28" dur="5.46">he needed to expose that this Iranian</text>
  <text start="1069.47" dur="5.55">deal was actually not good and I think</text>
  <text start="1072.74" dur="4.5">this is why all of this is happening now</text>
  <text start="1075.02" dur="5.52">we know that the deep state is panicking</text>
  <text start="1077.24" dur="5.99">q dropped some more Intel post 132 for</text>
  <text start="1080.54" dur="5.94">May 10th saying that the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1083.23" dur="5.62">individuals the five most wanted they</text>
  <text start="1086.48" dur="4.95">were captured and basically what they</text>
  <text start="1088.85" dur="5.49">did for this was out of the blue on</text>
  <text start="1091.43" dur="4.83">Thursday morning Trump tweeted that the</text>
  <text start="1094.34" dur="5.84">most wanted leaders of Isis had been</text>
  <text start="1096.26" dur="7.14">captured and they used an app on</text>
  <text start="1100.18" dur="4.48">Baghdadi&amp;#39;s smartphone to lure four</text>
  <text start="1103.4" dur="3.33">commanders from the terrorist</text>

  <text start="1110.27" dur="5.13">where they were captured by officials</text>
  <text start="1112.67" dur="5.79">now normally you don&amp;#39;t see the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1115.4" dur="4.8">state leaders which are they really the</text>
  <text start="1118.46" dur="3.16">Islamic state leaders or they paid</text>
  <text start="1120.2" dur="4.57">mercenaries put</text>
  <text start="1121.62" dur="5.13">thereby the united states deep state by</text>
  <text start="1124.77" dur="4.44">the coalition deep state forces and</text>
  <text start="1126.75" dur="3.99">israel and they&amp;#39;re out of the picture</text>
  <text start="1129.21" dur="2.099">they&amp;#39;re the ones who were calling the</text>
  <text start="1130.74" dur="2.1">shots</text>
  <text start="1131.309" dur="3.901">remember they kept on saying back daddy</text>
  <text start="1132.84" dur="4.65">he was killed oh then he was found alive</text>
  <text start="1135.21" dur="5.25">and he was killed well he&amp;#39;s a fictional</text>
  <text start="1137.49" dur="5.31">character that&amp;#39;s not really who that is</text>
  <text start="1140.46" dur="4.77">and this is why they keep saying this</text>
  <text start="1142.8" dur="5.07">over and over and over and I do believe</text>
  <text start="1145.23" dur="5.25">that black daddy is a Mossad agent and</text>
  <text start="1147.87" dur="7.01">moves in and out of different areas is</text>
  <text start="1150.48" dur="6.87">in disguise and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="1154.88" dur="4.929">basically all this was set up by the</text>
  <text start="1157.35" dur="4.47">deep state all of this was set up to</text>
  <text start="1159.809" dur="4.141">make us believe that the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1161.82" dur="6.359">is a real terrorist group al-qaeda is a</text>
  <text start="1163.95" dur="8.19">real terrorist group and in cues post it</text>
  <text start="1168.179" dur="6.991">says names no-name previous meetings</text>
  <text start="1172.14" dur="5.789">remember no name is McCain McCain met</text>
  <text start="1175.17" dur="5.73">with all the al-qaeda leaders all of</text>
  <text start="1177.929" dur="5.701">this was coordinated right now no name</text>
  <text start="1180.9" dur="5.46">is panicking and of course if you listen</text>
  <text start="1183.63" dur="6.56">to what he&amp;#39;s saying he&amp;#39;s really pushing</text>
  <text start="1186.36" dur="6.3">death funerals I think he&amp;#39;s using his</text>
  <text start="1190.19" dur="6.61">medical condition if he really does have</text>
  <text start="1192.66" dur="6.75">one to escape and Q says now comes the</text>
  <text start="1196.8" dur="5.49">pain because all of this is going to be</text>
  <text start="1199.41" dur="3.72">exposed and it looks like it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1202.29" dur="3.51">bad right now</text>
  <text start="1203.13" dur="4.89">and I think it looks a lot worse than it</text>
  <text start="1205.8" dur="4.65">is and I think things are gonna get a</text>
  <text start="1208.02" dur="4.32">lot better and clearer as time goes on</text>
  <text start="1210.45" dur="3.51">just like with North Korea when we</text>
  <text start="1212.34" dur="3.69">talked about North Korea where we</text>
  <text start="1213.96" dur="3.599">everyone was out there and the corporate</text>
  <text start="1216.03" dur="3.42">media was out there saying we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="1217.559" dur="3.841">towards war we were actually talking</text>
  <text start="1219.45" dur="3.87">about peace what was going on behind the</text>
  <text start="1221.4" dur="3.9">scenes and I do believe this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1223.32" dur="3.93">going on behind the scenes because Trump</text>
  <text start="1225.3" dur="4.14">keeps on saying he wants to bring the</text>
  <text start="1227.25" dur="5.1">troops home how do you get them home</text>
  <text start="1229.44" dur="6.03">yeah it&amp;#39;s the deep state will</text>
  <text start="1232.35" dur="5.579">continually push in Syria unless you</text>
  <text start="1235.47" dur="4.11">lock down Syria Syria is not locked down</text>
  <text start="1237.929" dur="2.911">right now and I think they have the</text>
  <text start="1239.58" dur="4.14">southern section and I think they need</text>
  <text start="1240.84" dur="5.79">the s-300 system there which would lock</text>
  <text start="1243.72" dur="6.06">down the airspace in that entire area</text>
  <text start="1246.63" dur="5.28">and we can see right now this looks like</text>
  <text start="1249.78" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s a push Iran is locked down with the</text>
  <text start="1251.91" dur="3.33">air their airspace and I think this is</text>
  <text start="1254.52" dur="2.73">part of the plan</text>
  <text start="1255.24" dur="5.52">and to shut all of this down and expose</text>
  <text start="1257.25" dur="5.49">what is going on with the uranium one</text>
  <text start="1260.76" dur="4.11">deal I think this is the main focus of</text>
