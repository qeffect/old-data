  <text start="123.46" dur="6.36">know when they lose control we will see</text>
  <text start="126.1" dur="5.1">it because after the first day and we</text>

  <text start="131.2" dur="6.63">day the market will drop dramatically it</text>
  <text start="134.83" dur="7.08">will drop by like 700 800 points by a</text>
  <text start="137.83" dur="5.82">thousand points and we will see the</text>

  <text start="146.32" dur="4.5">every time they try to push it up it</text>
  <text start="148.57" dur="4.229">moves further and further down this is</text>
  <text start="150.82" dur="4.41">how we&amp;#39;re going to know that we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="152.799" dur="4.761">the end game period of it so we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="155.23" dur="6.21">to have to watch to see what happens</text>
  <text start="157.56" dur="5.92">going into Monday but when we look at</text>
  <text start="161.44" dur="6.379">the entire economy</text>
  <text start="163.48" dur="9.149">we see that the system it is rapidly</text>
  <text start="167.819" dur="6.67">falling apart and we can look at the</text>
  <text start="172.629" dur="5.431">economy and compare it to a damn i mean</text>
  <text start="174.489" dur="6.091">there&amp;#39;s a hole that pops open they patch</text>
  <text start="178.06" dur="5.31">it and they continually do this until</text>
  <text start="180.58" dur="5.51">they run out of hands to cover up all</text>
  <text start="183.37" dur="5.729">the holes and patches and the damn</text>
  <text start="186.09" dur="6.039">continually leaks and eventually what</text>
  <text start="189.099" dur="5.661">happens is it breaks open and anything</text>
  <text start="192.129" dur="5.461">in its path when the waters come is</text>
  <text start="194.76" dur="4.36">completely destroyed and this is what</text>
  <text start="197.59" dur="4.7">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now because we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="199.12" dur="5.489">been watching the economic indicators</text>
  <text start="202.29" dur="4.779">we&amp;#39;re watching them contract we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="204.609" dur="5.25">watching them decline an economic</text>
  <text start="207.069" dur="5.371">collapse does not happen overnight I</text>
  <text start="209.859" dur="4.321">know many people think well I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="212.44" dur="3.24">seen the economic collapse you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="214.18" dur="3.3">talking about it everyone&amp;#39;s been talking</text>
  <text start="215.68" dur="5.55">about it and we haven&amp;#39;t seen it well</text>
  <text start="217.48" dur="8.52">think about what happened in 2008 do you</text>
  <text start="221.23" dur="7.86">really think that the day before all of</text>
  <text start="226" dur="6.51">a sudden the economic collapse just</text>
  <text start="229.09" dur="7.32">happened and then showed up the next day</text>
  <text start="232.51" dur="5.849">in the market no it was building all</text>
  <text start="236.41" dur="7.199">along actually there was an illusion</text>
  <text start="238.359" dur="8.81">that was set up for many years and the</text>
  <text start="243.609" dur="6.451">illusion kept everyone in the dark and</text>
  <text start="247.169" dur="4.271">the way they used the illusion was to</text>
  <text start="250.06" dur="3.6">say that these subprime securities were</text>
  <text start="251.44" dur="5.519">triple-a rated even know in the</text>
  <text start="253.66" dur="5.79">background millions of people were</text>
  <text start="256.959" dur="5.601">defaulting on their mortgages but they</text>
  <text start="259.45" dur="5.88">kept the subprime securities at triple-a</text>
  <text start="262.56" dur="5.95">we knew that a lot of companies were</text>
  <text start="265.33" dur="4.709">laying off a lot of people a lot of</text>
  <text start="268.51" dur="5.219">companies were going under at the same</text>
  <text start="270.039" dur="6.06">time that was all part of the collapse</text>
  <text start="273.729" dur="6.62">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="276.099" dur="7.44">same exact thing there is a process that</text>
  <text start="280.349" dur="4.931">goes along with the collapse it is the</text>
  <text start="283.539" dur="4.5">deterioration the contraction of the</text>
  <text start="285.28" dur="5.43">economy not to stock market the stock</text>
  <text start="288.039" dur="4.981">market has nothing to do with it the</text>
  <text start="290.71" dur="5.28">stock market is the last thing that they</text>
  <text start="293.02" dur="4.44">allow to completely collapse and that</text>
  <text start="295.99" dur="4.17">signals everyone</text>
  <text start="297.46" dur="5.13">and okay we&amp;#39;re in a collapse but</text>
  <text start="300.16" dur="6.539">everything that happens prior to this is</text>
  <text start="302.59" dur="6.479">what has brought us to this point when</text>
  <text start="306.699" dur="4.981">we look at unemployment when we look at</text>
  <text start="309.069" dur="6.901">retail when we look at housing and all</text>
  <text start="311.68" dur="7.32">the bubbles all of this is leading up to</text>
  <text start="315.97" dur="6.69">what is about to come and we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="319" dur="6.74">more and more of these indicators if we</text>
  <text start="322.66" dur="6.21">look at Germany their trade activity</text>
  <text start="325.74" dur="6.28">well we know it&amp;#39;s the largest European</text>
  <text start="328.87" dur="5.76">economy but their trade activity is</text>
  <text start="332.02" dur="5.119">shrinking and this is according to</text>
  <text start="334.63" dur="5.129">Germany&amp;#39;s federal statistical office</text>
  <text start="337.139" dur="5.861">exports showed their biggest decrease in</text>
  <text start="339.759" dur="6.541">seven years down by ten percent against</text>
  <text start="343" dur="6.56">the same period a year ago imports</text>
  <text start="346.3" dur="5.88">dropped by six point five percent and</text>
  <text start="349.56" dur="4.99">what they&amp;#39;re saying is that exports and</text>
  <text start="352.18" dur="5.34">imports they&amp;#39;re much lower than they</text>
  <text start="354.55" dur="5.79">actually expected we see here in the</text>
  <text start="357.52" dur="5.389">United States well up the Labor</text>
  <text start="360.34" dur="6.93">Department they&amp;#39;re playing games with</text>
  <text start="362.909" dur="7.75">the job numbers all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="367.27" dur="7.32">Labor Department decided the 150,000</text>
  <text start="370.659" dur="7.29">newly created jobs well we need to get</text>
  <text start="374.59" dur="7.379">rid of those and remove it and revise</text>
  <text start="377.949" dur="7.71">the numbers so basically they were just</text>
  <text start="381.969" dur="7.641">revised out of existence so if you go</text>
  <text start="385.659" dur="9.991">back in time and you subtract the</text>
  <text start="389.61" dur="9.69">150,000 jobs from all the job data we</text>
  <text start="395.65" dur="7.25">can see that it changes the information</text>
  <text start="399.3" dur="5.799">for each month where a lot of those</text>
  <text start="402.9" dur="3.819">months where they&amp;#39;re saying oh look they</text>
  <text start="405.099" dur="4.831">beat expectations actually they missed</text>
  <text start="406.719" dur="4.771">and we can see right now that the</text>
  <text start="409.93" dur="5.76">corporate media really doesn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="411.49" dur="6.899">tell you tell you about this so when we</text>
  <text start="415.69" dur="5.909">look at like August may-july April we</text>
  <text start="418.389" dur="5.37">can see that it&amp;#39;s changing the</text>
  <text start="421.599" dur="4.471">information now we know this is</text>
  <text start="423.759" dur="3.871">completely manipulated we know they</text>
  <text start="426.07" dur="3.87">change these numbers to make the</text>
  <text start="427.63" dur="3.58">upcoming months look a lot better than</text>
  <text start="429.94" dur="2.71">they really are and this is</text>
  <text start="431.21" dur="3.359">really what they&amp;#39;re planning on doing</text>
  <text start="432.65" dur="4.68">right now they&amp;#39;re trying to bring all</text>
  <text start="434.569" dur="4.591">the other numbers down lower so when we</text>
  <text start="437.33" dur="4.05">get the next job numbers that come out</text>
  <text start="439.16" dur="3.81">they can bring the unemployment down a</text>
  <text start="441.38" dur="3.36">notch because we know the elections are</text>
  <text start="442.97" dur="3.03">coming up we know they need to keep the</text>
  <text start="444.74" dur="4.2">illusion alive that the economy is</text>
  <text start="446" dur="4.259">strong and we&amp;#39;re full employment and we</text>
  <text start="448.94" dur="4.8">can see they&amp;#39;re preparing for this</text>
  <text start="450.259" dur="7.711">already we see that auto loans they have</text>
  <text start="453.74" dur="6.899">hit 2.4 trillion dollars student loans</text>
  <text start="457.97" dur="7.759">were at one point four trillion the</text>
  <text start="460.639" dur="9.601">bubbles are growing and we know that itt</text>
  <text start="465.729" dur="7.931">while they closed down 29 29,000</text>
  <text start="470.24" dur="6.239">students there a limbo right now and we</text>
  <text start="473.66" dur="6.68">see the US Department of Education well</text>
  <text start="476.479" dur="7.291">they&amp;#39;re trying to stop the students from</text>
  <text start="480.34" dur="7.75">applying for debt cancellations because</text>
  <text start="483.77" dur="6.48">once a college or school closes its not</text>
  <text start="488.09" dur="5.449">the fault of the student and the student</text>
  <text start="490.25" dur="6">has the right to tent to cancel the debt</text>
  <text start="493.539" dur="4.781">but we can see right now the Department</text>
  <text start="496.25" dur="3.87">of Education they&amp;#39;re trying to say well</text>
  <text start="498.32" dur="3.089">you can go to another school we really</text>
  <text start="500.12" dur="4.95">don&amp;#39;t want to cancel the debt right now</text>
  <text start="501.409" dur="4.771">and we can see most of the students are</text>
  <text start="505.07" dur="2.67">saying well you know something let me</text>
  <text start="506.18" dur="4.829">cancel the debt right now because I</text>
  <text start="507.74" dur="5.609">don&amp;#39;t need this debt and once it is</text>
  <text start="511.009" dur="4.291">canceled it looks like the American</text>
  <text start="513.349" dur="5.73">people are going to pick up the tab for</text>
  <text start="515.3" dur="8.31">this we can see right now that this</text>
  <text start="519.079" dur="5.851">situation is a complete disaster now</text>
  <text start="523.61" dur="5.15">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about real estate</text>
  <text start="524.93" dur="7.59">quite a bit and on Martin Armstrong&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="528.76" dur="6.819">website he has an article where it says</text>
  <text start="532.52" dur="5.61">real estate is turning down and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="535.579" dur="4.831">looking at the real estate market right</text>
  <text start="538.13" dur="5.49">now and he is seeing the same exact</text>
  <text start="540.41" dur="5.16">thing that we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="543.62" dur="4.25">saying New York Miami Los Angeles all</text>
  <text start="545.57" dur="4.98">three markets have begun to decline and</text>
  <text start="547.87" dur="6.39">we are now watching other markets like</text>
  <text start="550.55" dur="7.5">Chicago Vancouver London Hong Kong</text>
  <text start="554.26" dur="7.449">regions in Britain they&amp;#39;re all starting</text>
  <text start="558.05" dur="6.98">to decline and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="561.709" dur="7.451">home ownership has fallen to a 51.6 year</text>
  <text start="565.03" dur="7.5">lo from the nineteen sixty five high and</text>
  <text start="569.16" dur="7.05">we&amp;#39;re seeing an overall decline in the</text>
  <text start="572.53" dur="7.32">core markets and this is going to spread</text>
  <text start="576.21" dur="6.1">to the peripheral to other markets and</text>
  <text start="579.85" dur="6.39">this is exactly what we&amp;#39;ve been tracking</text>
  <text start="582.31" dur="6.75">and following and the market is rolling</text>
  <text start="586.24" dur="4.62">over right now the entire real estate</text>
  <text start="589.06" dur="5.06">market is going to be a complete</text>
  <text start="590.86" dur="6.45">disaster and we&amp;#39;re watching it unfold</text>
  <text start="594.12" dur="6.4">right in front of our eyes we see</text>
  <text start="597.31" dur="5.55">wholesale sales they slump two point</text>
  <text start="600.52" dur="4.29">four percent month on month this is the</text>
  <text start="602.86" dur="3.9">biggest drop since January and this is</text>
  <text start="604.81" dur="5.19">the 19th consecutive month of declines</text>
  <text start="606.76" dur="5.03">for wholesale sales and auto sales</text>
  <text start="610" dur="5.7">dropped for the third month in a row</text>
  <text start="611.79" dur="8.05">hardware has dropped farm products have</text>
  <text start="615.7" dur="7.76">dropped and when we look at each one of</text>
  <text start="619.84" dur="8.64">these areas we are seeing everything</text>
  <text start="623.46" dur="7.54">contract at the same time the illusion</text>
  <text start="628.48" dur="6.99">is falling apart the dam is getting</text>
  <text start="631" dur="7.83">ready to burst we see it might be game</text>
  <text start="635.47" dur="4.65">over for the ECB and for Europe think</text>
  <text start="638.83" dur="4.44">about what&amp;#39;s happening in Europe right</text>
  <text start="640.12" dur="5.34">now the ECB has cut interest rates into</text>
  <text start="643.27" dur="6.21">negative territory for four times right</text>
  <text start="645.46" dur="7.68">now it is also spent one trillion euros</text>
  <text start="649.48" dur="8.97">in QE and their balance sheet is at a</text>
  <text start="653.14" dur="7.26">record high the ECB its downgraded its</text>
  <text start="658.45" dur="7.29">growth forecast for the next two years</text>
  <text start="660.4" dur="6.9">and the ECB they&amp;#39;re admitting that</text>
  <text start="665.74" dur="5.7">they&amp;#39;re not going to hit their inflation</text>
  <text start="667.3" dur="9.18">target this decade and we can see right</text>
  <text start="671.44" dur="8.79">now that the situation in the EU it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="676.48" dur="8.67">disaster EU banks right now they were</text>
  <text start="680.23" dur="6.45">leveraged 26 to one with EU sovereign</text>
  <text start="685.15" dur="5.94">bonds being used as the senior-most</text>
  <text start="686.68" dur="6.21">assets on their balance sheets I mean</text>
  <text start="691.09" dur="4.32">you only need a four percent drop in au</text>
  <text start="692.89" dur="5.83">bon levels to render most large EU banks</text>
  <text start="695.41" dur="6.9">completely insolvent right now</text>
  <text start="698.72" dur="7.049">and we&amp;#39;re talking about a banking system</text>
  <text start="702.31" dur="6.43">that is worth more than forty six</text>
  <text start="705.769" dur="6.961">trillion dollars in size that&amp;#39;s twice</text>
  <text start="708.74" dur="5.49">the size of the US banking system and we</text>
  <text start="712.73" dur="4.02">know that all these banks are</text>
  <text start="714.23" dur="6.12">interconnected and when it goes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="716.75" dur="5.73">going to spread and like I said when</text>
  <text start="720.35" dur="5.179">you&amp;#39;re in front of that damn and that</text>
  <text start="722.48" dur="5.64">dam bursts and that water rushes out</text>
  <text start="725.529" dur="4.331">everything in its path is going to be</text>
  <text start="728.12" dur="6.409">destroyed and this is exactly what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="729.86" dur="9.24">seeing we&amp;#39;re seeing that central banks</text>
  <text start="734.529" dur="7.331">they understand that this system is not</text>
  <text start="739.1" dur="5.52">going to last and they know they need to</text>
  <text start="741.86" dur="6.99">get precious metals and they&amp;#39;re doing it</text>
  <text start="744.62" dur="7.13">kind of covertly in a stealthy way we</text>
  <text start="748.85" dur="5.479">see that the central banks many of them</text>
  <text start="751.75" dur="4.629">they&amp;#39;re trying to accumulate metals</text>
  <text start="754.329" dur="4.3">they&amp;#39;re doing it behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="756.379" dur="5.281">making sure that no one realizes it</text>
  <text start="758.629" dur="7.08">they&amp;#39;re printing up there fiat currency</text>
  <text start="761.66" dur="5.789">and we can see that two of them two of</text>
  <text start="765.709" dur="4.74">the central bank&amp;#39;s the Swiss and the</text>
  <text start="767.449" dur="4.801">Norwegian central banks well they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="770.449" dur="6.06">printed close to 1 billion dollars of</text>
  <text start="772.25" dur="6.48">fiat money and they&amp;#39;re not buying the</text>
  <text start="776.509" dur="5.101">physical precious metals because if they</text>
  <text start="778.73" dur="6.75">did that they would probably blow up the</text>
  <text start="781.61" dur="9.24">market so what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="785.48" dur="10.049">buying mining stocks they&amp;#39;re going ahead</text>
  <text start="790.85" dur="8.839">and purchasing mining shares so they are</text>
  <text start="795.529" dur="8.73">prepared and ready for what is coming</text>
  <text start="799.689" dur="7.21">it&amp;#39;s just a backdoor approach we see</text>
  <text start="804.259" dur="5.82">right now Deutsche Bank Jim Reed of</text>
  <text start="806.899" dur="5.43">Deutsche Bank is saying that well it</text>
  <text start="810.079" dur="7.351">looks like the 35-year economic super</text>
  <text start="812.329" dur="6.69">cycle is officially ending and when it</text>
  <text start="817.43" dur="4.23">ends it&amp;#39;s going to be a complete</text>
  <text start="819.019" dur="7.43">disaster because we have Jim Rogers mark</text>
  <text start="821.66" dur="8.88">Farber Andrew Smithers they are all</text>
  <text start="826.449" dur="5.391">warning that this system is about to</text>
  <text start="830.54" dur="3.79">collapse there</text>
  <text start="831.84" dur="6.15">saying that the stock market could crash</text>
  <text start="834.33" dur="5.52">by eighty percent even the Royal Bank of</text>
  <text start="837.99" dur="7.62">Scotland says the markets are flashing</text>
  <text start="839.85" dur="8.64">stress alerts similar to 2008 they told</text>
  <text start="845.61" dur="6.66">their clients sell everything get out</text>
  <text start="848.49" dur="6.86">now actually Jim Rickards came out and</text>
  <text start="852.27" dur="6.21">he actually put a date on the system</text>
  <text start="855.35" dur="5.56">falling apart collapsing and he said</text>
  <text start="858.48" dur="4.59">this is going to be September 30th of</text>
  <text start="860.91" dur="4.8">2016 now I don&amp;#39;t know how true this is</text>
  <text start="863.07" dur="7.77">but he actually put a date actually put</text>
  <text start="865.71" dur="7.2">a time on it he said 4pm so this is</text>
  <text start="870.84" dur="5.13">something that we need to watch and we</text>
  <text start="872.91" dur="5.84">know no matter what the date is going to</text>
  <text start="875.97" dur="5.67">be we know that this system is</text>
  <text start="878.75" dur="6.25">deteriorating contracting collapsing</text>
  <text start="881.64" dur="8.49">falling apart and we can see that this</text>
  <text start="885" dur="8.25">system eventually will collapse the dam</text>
  <text start="890.13" dur="5.01">will burst something will come out of</text>
  <text start="893.25" dur="4.32">left field something the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="895.14" dur="7.62">didn&amp;#39;t expect and we&amp;#39;ll bring the system</text>
  <text start="897.57" dur="7.59">down or the central banks will bring it</text>
  <text start="902.76" dur="4.23">down themselves before that happens and</text>
  <text start="905.16" dur="5.1">I think this is what they&amp;#39;re planning</text>
  <text start="906.99" dur="4.59">for I think they know exactly when</text>
  <text start="910.26" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re going to bring down the markets</text>
  <text start="911.58" dur="5.64">and I believe it&amp;#39;s going to be very very</text>
