  <text start="27.14" dur="5.349">hi welcome to the x 22 report my name is</text>
  <text start="30.15" dur="5.4">dave and this is episode 238 and today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="32.489" dur="5.25">date is December 13 2013 and the title</text>
  <text start="35.55" dur="3.96">this episode is Iran makes a move to</text>
  <text start="37.739" dur="4.111">replace the US military presence in the</text>
  <text start="39.51" dur="4.92">Middle East and we understand what is</text>
  <text start="41.85" dur="4.41">happening here the central bankers along</text>
  <text start="44.43" dur="3.299">with the US are trying to make a deal</text>
  <text start="46.26" dur="3.18">with Iran of course they have the</text>
  <text start="47.729" dur="4.531">illusion out there that it&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="49.44" dur="5.789">the nuclear program but behind the</text>
  <text start="52.26" dur="5.67">scenes we understand the main motive of</text>
  <text start="55.229" dur="5.461">the US and the central bankers they want</text>
  <text start="57.93" dur="4.86">to get inside the country to sell the</text>
  <text start="60.69" dur="4.77">natural resources using the US dollar</text>
  <text start="62.79" dur="5.43">and if we just look at that we can see</text>
  <text start="65.46" dur="5.899">past the nuclear illusion and see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="68.22" dur="7.259">going on here now yesterday I reported</text>
  <text start="71.359" dur="6.701">that the sanctions and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="75.479" dur="5.46">find those oil companies or any other</text>
  <text start="78.06" dur="5.339">business that does business with Iran at</text>
  <text start="80.939" dur="6.21">this point because the central bankers</text>
  <text start="83.399" dur="8.131">do not want Iran to sell their natural</text>
  <text start="87.149" dur="6.691">resources with these companies because</text>
  <text start="91.53" dur="3.899">they will be losing a lot of money and</text>
  <text start="93.84" dur="5.55">this is the purpose and this is the</text>
  <text start="95.429" dur="6.51">reason they place these sanctions in</text>
  <text start="99.39" dur="5.31">place right now now this has nothing to</text>
  <text start="101.939" dur="5.22">do with nuclear right now it has</text>
  <text start="104.7" dur="6.209">everything to do with the central</text>
  <text start="107.159" dur="7.111">bankers using the US dollar to pay for</text>
  <text start="110.909" dur="5.7">the natural resources inside Iran to</text>
  <text start="114.27" dur="4.949">other countries who are buying their</text>
  <text start="116.609" dur="6.661">natural resources and this is the</text>
  <text start="119.219" dur="6.631">problem right now now the question is</text>
  <text start="123.27" dur="5.61">has we understand the net the</text>
  <text start="125.85" dur="4.799">Revolutionary Guard has seen what the</text>
  <text start="128.88" dur="4.71">Western powers are doing and gave a</text>
  <text start="130.649" dur="5.4">warning to rohini is rohini looking at</text>
  <text start="133.59" dur="5.55">it and saying hold just a minute here I</text>
  <text start="136.049" dur="5.16">can see what&amp;#39;s going on or did the</text>
  <text start="139.14" dur="6.45">central bankers US government kind of</text>
  <text start="141.209" dur="6.931">set up iran to say hey listen they are</text>
  <text start="145.59" dur="4.86">not going along with this deal they just</text>
  <text start="148.14" dur="4.8">backed out and we were doing everything</text>
  <text start="150.45" dur="4.319">in our power and then eventually what</text>
  <text start="152.94" dur="3.96">will happen is there will be some type</text>
  <text start="154.769" dur="4.53">of false flag event because the only</text>
  <text start="156.9" dur="4.38">alternative they&amp;#39;ll have is to strike</text>
  <text start="159.299" dur="3.36">iran and they&amp;#39;ll make the case that they</text>
  <text start="161.28" dur="4.289">didn&amp;#39;t want us to go in and inspect</text>
  <text start="162.659" dur="5.16">their nuclear weapons and they&amp;#39;re hiding</text>
  <text start="165.569" dur="4.23">something and we need to take action now</text>
  <text start="167.819" dur="4.23">and then all of a sudden will have a</text>
  <text start="169.799" dur="4.89">false flag event here in the united</text>
  <text start="172.049" dur="4.41">states and then all bets are off and we</text>
  <text start="174.689" dur="3.601">understand this that the president the</text>
  <text start="176.459" dur="5.461">obama administration said to Congress</text>
  <text start="178.29" dur="6.27">listen we have these peace talks if you</text>
  <text start="181.92" dur="5.909">implement new sanctions the alternative</text>
  <text start="184.56" dur="5.129">is a military strike and this is what</text>
  <text start="187.829" dur="3.511">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now but let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="189.689" dur="4.711">into the economic collapse news and then</text>
  <text start="191.34" dur="5.31">we&amp;#39;ll work our way down and discuss what</text>
  <text start="194.4" dur="5.07">is happening with Iran and what they</text>
  <text start="196.65" dur="6.39">would like to do in the middle east area</text>

  <text start="218.37" dur="4.709">everything and everything to make things</text>
  <text start="220.86" dur="5.159">better but everything if you listen to</text>

  <text start="317.76" dur="4.47">to six million people are without health</text>
  <text start="319.95" dur="4.92">insurance at this time because they were</text>
  <text start="322.23" dur="5.07">canceled we are seeing the same exact</text>
  <text start="324.87" dur="6.06">thing we have high unemployment so all</text>
  <text start="327.3" dur="5.67">of this is not good for any nation and</text>
  <text start="330.93" dur="5.27">the United States right now is</text>
  <text start="332.97" dur="5.7">continually printing creating money</text>
  <text start="336.2" dur="4.93">faster the pace is getting faster and</text>
  <text start="338.67" dur="4.41">faster it is escalating and they cannot</text>
  <text start="341.13" dur="6.45">slow this down because if they slow this</text>
  <text start="343.08" dur="6.839">down the entire private western central</text>
  <text start="347.58" dur="6.53">bank world which is the eurozone</text>
  <text start="349.919" dur="8.131">Australia Canada UK United States</text>
  <text start="354.11" dur="6.79">completely implode on itself and that is</text>
  <text start="358.05" dur="4.53">it so when you hear taper they are not</text>
  <text start="360.9" dur="3.12">going to taper because they realize</text>
  <text start="362.58" dur="4.83">what&amp;#39;s going to happen when I taper</text>
  <text start="364.02" dur="6">because they are the market they are the</text>
  <text start="367.41" dur="5.19">ones who are controlling unemployment</text>
  <text start="370.02" dur="5.07">the manipulated numbers GDP the</text>
  <text start="372.6" dur="5.46">manipulated numbers inflation the minute</text>
  <text start="375.09" dur="6.36">the manipulated numbers they are pumping</text>
  <text start="378.06" dur="5.79">in 85 billion which to other sources it</text>
  <text start="381.45" dur="5.28">is a lot more to run 125 billion every</text>
  <text start="383.85" dur="4.65">single month to buy the Treasury bonds</text>
  <text start="386.73" dur="3.99">from other countries that are rejecting</text>
  <text start="388.5" dur="4.32">the Treasury bonds for in those</text>
  <text start="390.72" dur="5.22">countries that are selling the Treasury</text>
  <text start="392.82" dur="6.599">bonds and the only buyer is the Fed so</text>
  <text start="395.94" dur="5.82">the Fed is creating the money letting</text>
  <text start="399.419" dur="3.361">the the United States government borrow</text>
  <text start="401.76" dur="4.17">the money the United States government</text>
  <text start="402.78" dur="3.9">is creating these Treasury bonds and the</text>
  <text start="405.93" dur="3.35">Fed is</text>
  <text start="406.68" dur="6.57">taking these Treasury bonds back and</text>
  <text start="409.28" dur="8.29">it&amp;#39;s just a complete you know Ponzi</text>
  <text start="413.25" dur="8.37">scheme circle here and it just cannot be</text>
  <text start="417.57" dur="7.59">sustained at this time now Ireland is</text>
  <text start="421.62" dur="7.2">looking to exit the bailout from the EU</text>
  <text start="425.16" dur="6.15">and there are some reports that are</text>
  <text start="428.82" dur="5.73">saying that this is very misleading</text>
  <text start="431.31" dur="6.59">because the banks in Ireland are sitting</text>
  <text start="434.55" dur="6.27">on a stock pile of unreported or</text>
  <text start="437.9" dur="6.43">unrecognized debt and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="440.82" dur="7.11">hiding this in the banks and eventually</text>
  <text start="444.33" dur="6.72">what they&amp;#39;re going to do is turn inward</text>
  <text start="447.93" dur="6.329">and look at the depositors and creditors</text>
  <text start="451.05" dur="5.76">and do a ballon so what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="454.259" dur="6.481">some tricky accounting saying that where</text>
  <text start="456.81" dur="5.97">are you know we&amp;#39;re coming out of the the</text>
  <text start="460.74" dur="4.28">debt that we have with the EU and</text>
  <text start="462.78" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re coming out of the bailouts and</text>
  <text start="465.02" dur="7.81">this report is saying that the banks are</text>
  <text start="468.03" dur="6.93">hiding vast amount of unreported dead in</text>
  <text start="472.83" dur="4.53">the banks and eventually it will come</text>
  <text start="474.96" dur="5.16">out that they&amp;#39;re going to go into a</text>
  <text start="477.36" dur="6.15">bail-in mode and we know this is going</text>
  <text start="480.12" dur="6">to happen because the eurozone with your</text>
  <text start="483.51" dur="4.83">document has been set up and they are</text>
  <text start="486.12" dur="4.35">ready to go tomorrow the United States</text>
  <text start="488.34" dur="4.44">have the as the FDIC Bank of England</text>
  <text start="490.47" dur="4.65">document they are ready to go for a</text>
  <text start="492.78" dur="4.59">ballon Canada has a ballon documents</text>
  <text start="495.12" dur="4.289">Switzerland has a ballon document</text>
  <text start="497.37" dur="5.91">Australia has a ballon document and</text>
  <text start="499.409" dur="6.781">guess what they are ready to go because</text>
  <text start="503.28" dur="5.759">what they understand is they understand</text>
  <text start="506.19" dur="5.25">that this entire model cannot be</text>
  <text start="509.039" dur="4.44">sustained and unless they get some type</text>
  <text start="511.44" dur="5.399">of war going and we have to understand</text>
  <text start="513.479" dur="5.19">what does this word do well it it allows</text>
  <text start="516.839" dur="4.62">the countries to borrow more money</text>
  <text start="518.669" dur="4.92">because there&amp;#39;s a war going on it allows</text>
  <text start="521.459" dur="3.721">them to cancel that like if there is a</text>
  <text start="523.589" dur="5.701">war with China and Russia they can</text>
  <text start="525.18" dur="6.33">cancel the Treasury bond debt that we</text>
  <text start="529.29" dur="5.28">have the United States has with these</text>
  <text start="531.51" dur="5.819">countries and these central bankers what</text>
  <text start="534.57" dur="5.34">they do is they profit off of either</text>
  <text start="537.329" dur="4.441">side of of the war here</text>
  <text start="539.91" dur="4.71">and off of all the countries because</text>
  <text start="541.77" dur="4.68">they profit during the war and all eyes</text>
  <text start="544.62" dur="3.12">are off of the collapse that is</text>
  <text start="546.45" dur="3.15">happening within the country this</text>
  <text start="547.74" dur="4.02">collapse are still happening as the war</text>
  <text start="549.6" dur="4.38">is getting started but your mind and</text>
  <text start="551.76" dur="4.65">everything is readjusted to someplace</text>
  <text start="553.98" dur="4.68">else so you don&amp;#39;t see the collapse and</text>
  <text start="556.41" dur="3.5">they can say listen we&amp;#39;re in a war time</text>
  <text start="558.66" dur="4.71">right now everyone has to sacrifice</text>
  <text start="559.91" dur="5.5">everyone has to give up a lot because we</text>
  <text start="563.37" dur="4.53">are in war because they collapsed our</text>
  <text start="565.41" dur="6.36">economy and we need to do what we need</text>
  <text start="567.9" dur="5.91">to do and this is what war does and we</text>
  <text start="571.77" dur="5.1">can see how they are pushing this and</text>
  <text start="573.81" dur="4.86">trying to get something started and they</text>
  <text start="576.87" dur="5.46">need this to get started because they</text>
  <text start="578.67" dur="7.68">need to have your eyes looking someplace</text>
  <text start="582.33" dur="8.01">else for the blame and the blame will be</text>
  <text start="586.35" dur="8.61">on Iran Syria Russia China North Korea</text>
  <text start="590.34" dur="9">any of these other countries now here in</text>
  <text start="594.96" dur="7.35">the US the consumer consumerism is</text>
  <text start="599.34" dur="4.56">starting to slow down people are slowing</text>
  <text start="602.31" dur="4.11">down their purchases they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="603.9" dur="5.22">purchasing as much as they&amp;#39;ve done in</text>
  <text start="606.42" dur="5.58">the past and we&amp;#39;re hitting a peak right</text>
  <text start="609.12" dur="5.78">now and it&amp;#39;s starting to decrease and</text>
  <text start="612" dur="7.59">what we&amp;#39;re seeing on a 12 month average</text>
  <text start="614.9" dur="6.91">annual percentage retail sales even</text>
  <text start="619.59" dur="4.23">though you know they report that during</text>
  <text start="621.81" dur="4.74">the holiday season you know we&amp;#39;re up</text>
  <text start="623.82" dur="5.22">whatever it is point six percent if you</text>
  <text start="626.55" dur="6.75">look the overall at the overall trend</text>
  <text start="629.04" dur="8.16">the retail sales starting this year has</text>
  <text start="633.3" dur="6.15">decreased from seven percent down to</text>
  <text start="637.2" dur="6.09">four percent now we have to remember</text>
  <text start="639.45" dur="7.32">back in the crisis of 2008 2009 when it</text>
  <text start="643.29" dur="5.94">really hit retail sales drop to negative</text>
  <text start="646.77" dur="5.82">ten percent and it was pumped all the</text>
  <text start="649.23" dur="7.23">way back up to about seven percent and</text>
  <text start="652.59" dur="5.52">now we are in a decline from seven</text>
  <text start="656.46" dur="2.76">percent down to four percent and if you</text>
  <text start="658.11" dur="3.87">look at the graph you want to come to</text>

  <text start="666.96" dur="5.01">you can see the graph we are in a</text>
  <text start="669.15" dur="4.35">decline in retail sales and what else</text>
  <text start="671.97" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;re seeing here is that</text>
  <text start="673.5" dur="7.65">u.s. economic growth gauge is slips in</text>
  <text start="676.56" dur="8.85">the latest weeks and a the weekly index</text>

  <text start="685.41" dur="8.04">december six from a revised 130 2.7 so</text>
  <text start="690.84" dur="8.33">the economic growth gauge is declining</text>
  <text start="693.45" dur="9.36">also now we understand that the</text>
  <text start="699.17" dur="7.75">government has come out with a budget</text>
  <text start="702.81" dur="7.34">plan and Ben Swann was reporting on the</text>

  <text start="722.28" dur="6.81">sounds pretty good doesn&amp;#39;t it the plan</text>
  <text start="725.45" dur="7.24">okay well the plan calls for raising</text>
  <text start="729.09" dur="6.21">fees but then we have to look at what do</text>
  <text start="732.69" dur="5.49">they mean by raising fees well the plan</text>
  <text start="735.3" dur="5.37">reportedly calls for increases in higher</text>
  <text start="738.18" dur="6.06">airline fees which if that is the case</text>
  <text start="740.67" dur="6.87">is a tax and that is just one of the</text>
  <text start="744.24" dur="6.3">fees there are many many other fees part</text>
  <text start="747.54" dur="4.68">of the plan is to reduce a the 23</text>
  <text start="750.54" dur="4.23">billion dollars in the spending over ten</text>
  <text start="752.22" dur="5.64">years is to first do away with those</text>
  <text start="754.77" dur="7.62">pesky automatic sequester cuts to the</text>
  <text start="757.86" dur="6.479">tune of 65 billion dollars and what</text>
  <text start="762.39" dur="7.02">they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="764.339" dur="8.281">reduce all of this by using taxpayer fee</text>
  <text start="769.41" dur="5.82">so really their taxes and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="772.62" dur="4.5">changing the name of what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="775.23" dur="5.67">here now they&amp;#39;re calling them fees and</text>
  <text start="777.12" dur="7.01">they&amp;#39;re really taxpayer taxes and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="780.9" dur="6.21">what they are and ultimately it will cut</text>
  <text start="784.13" dur="5.91">23 billion dollars in spending over the</text>
  <text start="787.11" dur="6.27">next ten years which is really nothing</text>
  <text start="790.04" dur="7.84">but it will do so by increasing spending</text>
  <text start="793.38" dur="6.9">by 65 billion dollars right now so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="797.88" dur="5.16">say they&amp;#39;re going to spend sixty five</text>
  <text start="800.28" dur="6">billion right now and over the next ten</text>
  <text start="803.04" dur="3.99">years is going to be 23 billion dollars</text>
  <text start="806.28" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="807.03" dur="5.1">and that comes out to be about 2.3</text>
  <text start="810.03" dur="4.32">billion dollars each year that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="812.13" dur="4.56">cutting but if we look at the amount</text>
  <text start="814.35" dur="7.56">that they&amp;#39;re boring they were boring a</text>
  <text start="816.69" dur="8.69">trillion dollars every single year so</text>
  <text start="821.91" dur="7.65">with this it does absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="825.38" dur="7.33">it&amp;#39;s almost like saying okay here I&amp;#39;m in</text>
  <text start="829.56" dur="4.68">a household right now and my monthly</text>
  <text start="832.71" dur="3.72">bills come out to I don&amp;#39;t know four or</text>
  <text start="834.24" dur="4.08">five thousand dollars and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="836.43" dur="4.97">cut this you know because it&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="838.32" dur="7.11">too high by ten bucks every single month</text>

  <text start="971.73" dur="6.27">of mass shootings we have had in the</text>
  <text start="974.76" dur="6.75">last what is it for five months four</text>
  <text start="978" dur="5.64">months i mean there are just one after</text>
  <text start="981.51" dur="4.769">another because they are building and</text>
  <text start="983.64" dur="4.949">building and building and the one that</text>
  <text start="986.279" dur="4.801">is really horrific is going to be the</text>
  <text start="988.589" dur="8.041">one where they&amp;#39;re going to push this</text>
  <text start="991.08" dur="8.129">agenda fast forward and get the UN arms</text>
  <text start="996.63" dur="5.31">treaty and the dianne feinstein bill</text>
  <text start="999.209" dur="5.221">that are pending in the senate passed</text>
  <text start="1001.94" dur="4.53">this is what they are trying to do and</text>
  <text start="1004.43" dur="4.02">what they do is they build it up they</text>
  <text start="1006.47" dur="4.14">build it up they mass shooting mass</text>
  <text start="1008.45" dur="5.49">shooting mass shooting mass shooting big</text>
  <text start="1010.61" dur="6.419">mass shooting you see we need to do</text>
  <text start="1013.94" dur="5.04">something to confiscate all the weapons</text>
  <text start="1017.029" dur="4.011">and it will be very easy for them to</text>
  <text start="1018.98" dur="5.01">confiscate and people don&amp;#39;t believe this</text>
  <text start="1021.04" dur="5.529">because you have to remember most of the</text>
  <text start="1023.99" dur="5.339">people about eighty percent of them will</text>
  <text start="1026.569" dur="4.89">abide by the new law just like is</text>
  <text start="1029.329" dur="4.561">happening in New York a letter went out</text>
  <text start="1031.459" dur="5.13">and anyone who has a weapon with more</text>

  <text start="1036.589" dur="4.171">return has to turn them in to the police</text>
  <text start="1038.449" dur="4.291">stations and guess what eighty percent</text>
  <text start="1040.76" dur="4.98">of the people will do it twenty percent</text>
  <text start="1042.74" dur="4.8">will not but they will get majority of</text>
  <text start="1045.74" dur="6.84">the weapons and this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1047.54" dur="8.34">trying to do at this point now we heard</text>
  <text start="1052.58" dur="5.099">a lot about the government wanting to</text>
  <text start="1055.88" dur="5.37">collect our DNA because they want to</text>
  <text start="1057.679" dur="6.75">create this huge DNA database and keep</text>
  <text start="1061.25" dur="5.82">track of people well they&amp;#39;ve they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1064.429" dur="4.081">coming up with ways to do this and one</text>
  <text start="1067.07" dur="6.21">of the ways to do this because we</text>
  <text start="1068.51" dur="5.55">understand that the NSA the DHS TSA CIA</text>
  <text start="1073.28" dur="4.23">s</text>
  <text start="1074.06" dur="6.39">I are all spying on everyone they are</text>
  <text start="1077.51" dur="6.6">keeping social profiles and they like to</text>
  <text start="1080.45" dur="6.36">get everyone&amp;#39;s DNA on record in the</text>
  <text start="1084.11" dur="4.44">database so they can track people a lot</text>
  <text start="1086.81" dur="3.62">easier and it will make it easier to</text>
  <text start="1088.55" dur="4.23">identify people they&amp;#39;re also using</text>
  <text start="1090.43" dur="5.08">facial recognition to make it easier to</text>
  <text start="1092.78" dur="4.56">identify people and what we are seeing</text>
  <text start="1095.51" dur="4.56">right now is the United States is</text>
  <text start="1097.34" dur="5.61">seeking devices to scan the bodies of</text>
  <text start="1100.07" dur="5.88">terrorist suspects for signs of possible</text>
  <text start="1102.95" dur="6.03">work with with met weapons of mass</text>
  <text start="1105.95" dur="6.18">destruction now again who are these</text>
  <text start="1108.98" dur="6.96">terrorist suspects well the potential</text>
  <text start="1112.13" dur="6.42">bio intelligence chips would ID ideally</text>
  <text start="1115.94" dur="5.28">be able to scan people within a half an</text>
  <text start="1118.55" dur="4.86">hour for minute my new quantities of</text>
  <text start="1121.22" dur="3.9">materials that could indicate whether</text>
  <text start="1123.41" dur="7.2">they have handled biological or chemical</text>
  <text start="1125.12" dur="7.74">arms but again how do they get this and</text>
  <text start="1130.61" dur="4.35">how they how do they know who the</text>
  <text start="1132.86" dur="5.12">terrorist suspects are well it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="1134.96" dur="6.03">much everybody so what they need to do</text>
  <text start="1137.98" dur="4.63">and what they&amp;#39;re going to say that this</text>
  <text start="1140.99" dur="4.62">is mandatory now just like it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1142.61" dur="4.68">mandatory pat down because we have this</text>
  <text start="1145.61" dur="3.05">new scanning what we will need the</text>
  <text start="1147.29" dur="4.4">device should be able to examine</text>
  <text start="1148.66" dur="5.58">multiple biomarkers found in a</text>
  <text start="1151.69" dur="6.46">physiological fluids such as blood</text>
  <text start="1154.24" dur="5.71">saliva sweat feces or urine so as you go</text>
  <text start="1158.15" dur="4.47">through the airport they will be</text>
  <text start="1159.95" dur="5.13">swabbing you asking you to pee in a cup</text>
  <text start="1162.62" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;ll collect your sweat and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1165.08" dur="5.73">have your DNA information because again</text>
  <text start="1168.02" dur="5.43">how do they know who the terrorist</text>
  <text start="1170.81" dur="4.83">suspect is and how do they know which</text>
  <text start="1173.45" dur="4.47">person will have this on them well they</text>
  <text start="1175.64" dur="5.33">don&amp;#39;t so we have to do it to everyone</text>
  <text start="1177.92" dur="6.6">and this is how they will be able to</text>
  <text start="1180.97" dur="6.99">create their DNA database that they want</text>
  <text start="1184.52" dur="6.36">to create so they can match everyone up</text>
  <text start="1187.96" dur="5.23">whoever everyone where everyone is with</text>
  <text start="1190.88" dur="5.22">facial recognition social profile and</text>
  <text start="1193.19" dur="5.76">now they have DNA markers to keep track</text>
  <text start="1196.1" dur="4.65">of everyone and this is where what</text>
  <text start="1198.95" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re trying to do and this is how</text>
  <text start="1200.75" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re trying to push this forward</text>
  <text start="1202.16" dur="5.34">because we are definitely turning into a</text>
  <text start="1204.44" dur="7.31">police state</text>
  <text start="1207.5" dur="11.64">now we understand out in North Korea Kim</text>
  <text start="1211.75" dur="9.76">Jong Un&amp;#39;s uncle was killed and right now</text>
  <text start="1219.14" dur="5.22">the New York Times is reporting I</text>

  <text start="1226.55" dur="5.25">right now is undergoing a period of</text>
  <text start="1229.04" dur="5.91">instability and they are playing this up</text>
  <text start="1231.8" dur="4.74">big time and this goes on to say if two</text>
  <text start="1234.95" dur="3.93">weeks ago we thought that North Korea</text>
  <text start="1236.54" dur="4.32">was somewhat stable I think today people</text>
  <text start="1238.88" dur="4.65">feel that it&amp;#39;s not stable as we thought</text>
  <text start="1240.86" dur="5.13">it was and I think if we continue to</text>
  <text start="1243.53" dur="4.71">wait for him to do things he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1245.99" dur="4.17">continue to shoot missiles and probably</text>
  <text start="1248.24" dur="5.73">at some point decided to test a nuclear</text>
  <text start="1250.16" dur="5.79">weapon using his missiles and they are</text>
  <text start="1253.97" dur="5.19">building this up the propaganda is</text>
  <text start="1255.95" dur="6.12">moving forward because again the central</text>
  <text start="1259.16" dur="4.59">bankers need to start war with a country</text>

  <text start="1268.04" dur="10.32">collapse that is coming now we</text>
  <text start="1273.74" dur="7.89">understand that the United States is</text>

  <text start="1293.78" dur="4.26">this will make it easier because if</text>
  <text start="1295.46" dur="5.34">there is a time where they cannot refuel</text>

  <text start="1499.409" dur="6.961">bankers will lose a lot of money so</text>
  <text start="1501.5" dur="7.659">right now Iran said okay we are holding</text>
  <text start="1506.37" dur="4.919">the nuclear talks at this point and of</text>
  <text start="1509.159" dur="4.711">course they keep the sharada out there</text>
  <text start="1511.289" dur="5.39">that it is for nuclear talks but we have</text>
  <text start="1513.87" dur="8.299">to remember one thing if it was truly</text>
  <text start="1516.679" dur="8.74">for nuclear talks why does the u.s. have</text>
  <text start="1522.169" dur="5.171">no problem with Iran testing a ballistic</text>

  <text start="1548.7" dur="5.67">especially oil companies it doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="1551.94" dur="5.699">any sense well it does make sense if you</text>
  <text start="1554.37" dur="5.669">look at at it from the perspective of</text>

  <text start="1560.039" dur="2.88">bankers are like well we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>

  <text start="1568.71" dur="4.29">that at this time because we are still</text>
  <text start="1570.96" dur="4.41">working out this you know this whole</text>
  <text start="1573" dur="4.169">deal but the illusion of the nuclear</text>
  <text start="1575.37" dur="5.45">talks they&amp;#39;re ok with the ballistic</text>
  <text start="1577.169" dur="6.781">missile they&amp;#39;re ok with them having</text>
  <text start="1580.82" dur="5.62">enriched uranium because they understand</text>

  <text start="1586.44" dur="6.9">nuclear a nuclear bomb or anything like</text>
  <text start="1590.61" dur="7.049">that and this is what is happening right</text>
  <text start="1593.34" dur="6.51">now and again we have to go back to what</text>
  <text start="1597.659" dur="5.461">the president the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="1599.85" dur="6.12">said M Congress the Obama said to</text>
  <text start="1603.12" dur="4.83">Congress listen no new sanctions because</text>
  <text start="1605.97" dur="4.29">if he put sanctions on Iran right now</text>
  <text start="1607.95" dur="4.29">I only have one course of action and</text>
  <text start="1610.26" dur="5.159">that&amp;#39;s a military strike so right now</text>
  <text start="1612.24" dur="5.069">Iran is backing out now the US could do</text>
  <text start="1615.419" dur="3.6">one or two things they can point a</text>
  <text start="1617.309" dur="4.35">finger and said listen we were going for</text>
  <text start="1619.019" dur="4.89">peace we wanted peace and Iran decided</text>
  <text start="1621.659" dur="3.99">to back out and this has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="1623.909" dur="4.471">with the nuclear talks of why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1625.649" dur="4.711">backing out and see Iran doesn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1628.38" dur="4.95">peace and now they&amp;#39;re building up their</text>
  <text start="1630.36" dur="5.699">nuclear arsenal and we&amp;#39;re very nervous</text>
  <text start="1633.33" dur="5.91">about them attacking the United States I</text>
  <text start="1636.059" dur="9.931">mean they could take that maneuver and</text>
  <text start="1639.24" dur="8.429">go with you know that that angle or they</text>
  <text start="1645.99" dur="4.559">can continue with the peace talks and</text>
  <text start="1647.669" dur="5.22">try to work it out but if you look at</text>
  <text start="1650.549" dur="4.26">what&amp;#39;s happening right now the White</text>
  <text start="1652.889" dur="5.221">House claims that they might now</text>
  <text start="1654.809" dur="5.34">implement new Iran sanctions they are it</text>
  <text start="1658.11" dur="6.12">is possible and white house press</text>
  <text start="1660.149" dur="6.361">secretary John Jay Carney said that new</text>
  <text start="1664.23" dur="4.74">sanctions for a run Iran could be</text>
  <text start="1666.51" dur="4.62">possible today in the White House press</text>
  <text start="1668.97" dur="5.64">briefing now why would he say that all</text>
  <text start="1671.13" dur="6">of a sudden when the White House said no</text>
  <text start="1674.61" dur="5.909">no new sanctions and they put the kibosh</text>
  <text start="1677.13" dur="5.58">on it and now they&amp;#39;re saying that you</text>
  <text start="1680.519" dur="4.53">know they might do it and this goes on</text>
  <text start="1682.71" dur="3.809">to say that this revelation was somewhat</text>
  <text start="1685.049" dur="5.37">surprising considering the</text>
  <text start="1686.519" dur="6.451">administration was very public it with</text>
  <text start="1690.419" dur="4.821">the push against additional sanctions so</text>
  <text start="1692.97" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s a very confusing message because</text>
  <text start="1695.24" dur="3.789">what does it mean it means that the</text>
  <text start="1697.47" dur="5.88">central bankers aren&amp;#39;t getting their way</text>
  <text start="1699.029" dur="6.36">Iran woke up rohini understood now what</text>
  <text start="1703.35" dur="3.809">is going on and now they&amp;#39;re backing off</text>
  <text start="1705.389" dur="4.111">because they see the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="1707.159" dur="4.711">trying to maneuver their way in and they</text>
  <text start="1709.5" dur="4.799">are saying ho hold it I mean we will</text>
  <text start="1711.87" dur="5.37">have to wait to see what is going on but</text>
  <text start="1714.299" dur="6.891">at the same time Iran is saying you know</text>
  <text start="1717.24" dur="8.58">what what we should do right now is</text>
  <text start="1721.19" dur="7.3">remove the US as the military presence</text>
  <text start="1725.82" dur="4.62">here in the Middle East and Iran has</text>
  <text start="1728.49" dur="4.5">proposed a regional cooperation council</text>
  <text start="1730.44" dur="5.19">that would focus on military and</text>

  <text start="1755.76" dur="6.9">they&amp;#39;re really saying is is that we need</text>
  <text start="1759.66" dur="5.76">to get rid of the US and this the</text>
  <text start="1762.66" dur="4.68">central bankers have the US military</text>
  <text start="1765.42" dur="3.99">there to protect their interest and keep</text>
  <text start="1767.34" dur="5.31">the US dollar as a reserve currency and</text>
  <text start="1769.41" dur="7.14">Iran is making the move to remove the</text>
  <text start="1772.65" dur="6.42">u.s. from the entire region and I said</text>
  <text start="1776.55" dur="4.71">this in my other reports that the United</text>
  <text start="1779.07" dur="6.63">States is losing control in the Middle</text>
  <text start="1781.26" dur="6.84">East Egypt Saudi Arabia are talking to</text>
  <text start="1785.7" dur="6.36">other countries like Russia and China</text>
  <text start="1788.1" dur="6.42">making deals buying weapons and Turkey</text>
  <text start="1792.06" dur="5.7">tried to do this but the United States</text>
  <text start="1794.52" dur="7.26">came in and forced Turkey not to buy</text>
  <text start="1797.76" dur="6">Chinese missiles and put a lot of</text>
  <text start="1801.78" dur="4.59">pressure on them and they didn&amp;#39;t do this</text>
  <text start="1803.76" dur="6.21">and we&amp;#39;re seeing many things happen</text>
  <text start="1806.37" dur="5.67">right now we see in Yemen of course the</text>
  <text start="1809.97" dur="4.62">people who do not want the central</text>
  <text start="1812.04" dur="4.98">bankers in their country are rising up</text>
  <text start="1814.59" dur="4.53">but they&amp;#39;re a drone attacks to keep them</text>
  <text start="1817.02" dur="4.65">suppressed and right now there was a</text>
  <text start="1819.12" dur="4.5">drone attack which attacked a wedding</text>
  <text start="1821.67" dur="4.08">which had nothing to do with anything</text>
  <text start="1823.62" dur="3.57">they were having a wedding and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1825.75" dur="5.22">saying that there was some type of</text>
  <text start="1827.19" dur="4.92">al-qaeda person in the area so they blew</text>
  <text start="1830.97" dur="3.54">up the entire wedding in the wedding</text>
  <text start="1832.11" dur="6.18">party a lot of them were killed and hurt</text>
  <text start="1834.51" dur="7.08">and we can see that this whole entire</text>
  <text start="1838.29" dur="6.18">force of the United States is to keep</text>
  <text start="1841.59" dur="5.79">the central bankers interest in tact</text>
  <text start="1844.47" dur="4.77">across the Middle East and there slowly</text>
  <text start="1847.38" dur="5.25">but surely have to remember that Yemen</text>
  <text start="1849.24" dur="6.21">is a strategic location in the Middle</text>
  <text start="1852.63" dur="6.15">East is a choke point right there for</text>
  <text start="1855.45" dur="5.85">cargo to go back and forth and oil to go</text>
  <text start="1858.78" dur="4.83">back and forth in the sea but we can see</text>
  <text start="1861.3" dur="5.1">what&amp;#39;s happening here is there can the</text>
  <text start="1863.61" dur="5.28">Empire is continually pushing and trying</text>
  <text start="1866.4" dur="5.43">to make control maintain control in this</text>
  <text start="1868.89" dur="6.39">area and they are losing control at this</text>
  <text start="1871.83" dur="6.51">time and this goes on to say</text>
  <text start="1875.28" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s time we focus on rise of terrorism</text>
  <text start="1878.34" dur="3.81">and extreme ideologies under the banner</text>
  <text start="1880.14" dur="4.62">of al-qaeda in the region including</text>

  <text start="1890.07" dur="5.43">that they see all over the place is not</text>
  <text start="1892.95" dur="6.42">real terrorism it&amp;#39;s manufactured</text>
  <text start="1895.5" dur="5.7">terrorism to keep the US government</text>

  <text start="1901.2" dur="8.22">interest protected by the US government</text>
  <text start="1903.39" dur="8.7">and the Western forces okay now there is</text>

  <text start="1921.09" dur="6.3">breach will occur every month in 2014</text>
  <text start="1925.14" dur="5.67">the question is how do they know this</text>
  <text start="1927.39" dur="6.51">well we see the sophistication of</text>
  <text start="1930.81" dur="5.75">threats expanding at a rapid pace which</text>
  <text start="1933.9" dur="6.05">will impact individuals businesses and</text>

  <text start="1939.95" dur="5.44">completely being set up for what is</text>
  <text start="1942.78" dur="6.51">coming and i believe and i know that</text>
  <text start="1945.39" dur="5.82">this entire nuclear deal with iran is</text>
  <text start="1949.29" dur="4.59">I&amp;#39;ve said this many times is a complete</text>
  <text start="1951.21" dur="6.48">illusion this will eventually break down</text>
  <text start="1953.88" dur="7.65">this will be a setup to create some type</text>
  <text start="1957.69" dur="6.9">of false flag we see the central bankers</text>
  <text start="1961.53" dur="5.16">are tricky they like to maneuver they</text>

  <text start="1966.69" dur="6.27">they like to start something and we can</text>
  <text start="1969.75" dur="5.67">see how they operate and they are doing</text>
