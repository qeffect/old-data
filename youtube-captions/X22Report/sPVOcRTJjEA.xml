  <text start="163.99" dur="6.21">is going to push the No Deal brexit</text>
  <text start="166.99" dur="5.61">October 31st there was a point in time</text>
  <text start="170.2" dur="4.94">where the Parliament was not in session</text>
  <text start="172.6" dur="5.28">they decided hey we&amp;#39;re gonna vote and</text>
  <text start="175.14" dur="6.94">we&amp;#39;re going to be in session during this</text>
  <text start="177.88" dur="7.62">period of time to maybe stop or vote for</text>
  <text start="182.08" dur="6.33">Boris to push through this No Deal</text>
  <text start="185.5" dur="6.84">brexit now if Boris doesn&amp;#39;t follow</text>
  <text start="188.41" dur="6.48">through the people have already spoken</text>
  <text start="192.34" dur="5.34">and said listen you might as well just</text>
  <text start="194.89" dur="5.22">resign because this is not what we</text>
  <text start="197.68" dur="5.37">wanted we wanted to break off from the</text>
  <text start="200.11" dur="6.54">EU this is why we had the referendum now</text>
  <text start="203.05" dur="6.54">the EU has already come out and they</text>
  <text start="206.65" dur="5.79">broadcasted their message to Boris</text>
  <text start="209.59" dur="5.01">Johnson the Europeans ed it would not</text>
  <text start="212.44" dur="4.95">heed his election promises of</text>
  <text start="214.6" dur="6.63">renegotiating brexit this is coming out</text>
  <text start="217.39" dur="5.76">of the blocks negotiator we look forward</text>
  <text start="221.23" dur="4.289">to working constructively with Prime</text>
  <text start="223.15" dur="4.86">Minister Johnson when he takes office to</text>
  <text start="225.519" dur="4.771">facilitate the ratification of the Ridge</text>
  <text start="228.01" dur="5.1">oral agreement and achieve an orderly</text>
  <text start="230.29" dur="5.37">brexit and they are not looking to</text>
  <text start="233.11" dur="5.55">renegotiate they already have a deal and</text>
  <text start="235.66" dur="5.28">this is the deal they want think about</text>
  <text start="238.66" dur="5.79">what the central bank the EU is doing</text>
  <text start="240.94" dur="8.9">right now they&amp;#39;re presenting the same</text>
  <text start="244.45" dur="8.099">exact deal which continually failed and</text>
  <text start="249.84" dur="5.619">what they&amp;#39;re saying is there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="252.549" dur="6.841">to discuss this is what we want and you</text>
  <text start="255.459" dur="7.591">better do it now I would think that the</text>
  <text start="259.39" dur="7.08">EU realizes that Boris if he stands firm</text>
  <text start="263.05" dur="6.24">and what he promised he will exit with</text>
  <text start="266.47" dur="6.12">no deal which means the central bank the</text>
  <text start="269.29" dur="6.09">EU is going to try to use fear maybe</text>
  <text start="272.59" dur="4.8">events to try to push him in a different</text>
  <text start="275.38" dur="5.13">direction this is something that we have</text>
  <text start="277.39" dur="8.91">to watch now we know that the tariffs</text>
  <text start="280.51" dur="8.46">are not causing the global slowdown yes</text>
  <text start="286.3" dur="4.95">I know the IMF the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="288.97" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re all blaming it on Trump in the</text>
  <text start="291.25" dur="3.61">tariffs he&amp;#39;s the one who&amp;#39;s causing the</text>
  <text start="293.5" dur="4.08">global</text>
  <text start="294.86" dur="5.19">that is the only explanation for this</text>
  <text start="297.58" dur="5.95">well we&amp;#39;ve been looking at this we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="300.05" dur="4.92">been following it we understand what has</text>
  <text start="303.53" dur="4.74">been happening in the past and this is</text>
  <text start="304.97" dur="7.26">why we&amp;#39;ve been following this every</text>
  <text start="308.27" dur="6.24">single day so this way all the</text>
  <text start="312.23" dur="6.3">mainstream media outlets the central</text>
  <text start="314.51" dur="7.08">banks can&amp;#39;t come out of nowhere and tell</text>
  <text start="318.53" dur="6.15">us that it&amp;#39;s because of this one reason</text>
  <text start="321.59" dur="6.06">that&amp;#39;s why this is happening and this is</text>
  <text start="324.68" dur="7.32">the reason we&amp;#39;ve been doing this to make</text>
  <text start="327.65" dur="6.6">sure that we understand what is really</text>
  <text start="332" dur="3.69">going on now think about what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="334.25" dur="4.17">saying they&amp;#39;re saying the whole entire</text>
  <text start="335.69" dur="6.48">global slowdown is because of the</text>
  <text start="338.42" dur="4.38">tariffs now we discussed this many many</text>
  <text start="342.17" dur="4.2">times before</text>
  <text start="342.8" dur="9.05">and if we go back in time right after</text>
  <text start="346.37" dur="10.35">the financial crisis the IMF has</text>
  <text start="351.85" dur="7.96">continually forecasted incredible GDP</text>
  <text start="356.72" dur="4.92">numbers if we go back to 2011 they said</text>
  <text start="359.81" dur="3.84">the GDP numbers are gonna be like four</text>
  <text start="361.64" dur="4.2">point five percent if we go back to 2012</text>
  <text start="363.65" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re talking about five percent if we</text>
  <text start="365.84" dur="4.14">go back to 2013 it&amp;#39;s the same thing</text>
  <text start="368.24" dur="5.1">these high numbers and what they do is</text>
  <text start="369.98" dur="5.28">they say well we were a little off or</text>
  <text start="373.34" dur="4.59">they don&amp;#39;t even say that would you we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="375.26" dur="5.91">just going to recalculate and here are</text>
  <text start="377.93" dur="6.38">the real GDP numbers now when you look</text>
  <text start="381.17" dur="8.73">at what has been happening with the IMF</text>
  <text start="384.31" dur="9.43">since the financial crisis world GDP</text>
  <text start="389.9" dur="6.87">numbers have been declining now in 2010</text>
  <text start="393.74" dur="6.39">they are around 5% growth a little bit</text>
  <text start="396.77" dur="6.72">over five point one or so in 2011 they</text>
  <text start="400.13" dur="5.43">came down to three point nine in 2012</text>
  <text start="403.49" dur="6.54">we&amp;#39;re looking at three point four in</text>
  <text start="405.56" dur="8.34">2013 three point three moved back up to</text>
  <text start="410.03" dur="8.97">three point four in 2014 2015 it dropped</text>
  <text start="413.9" dur="7.38">to three point two and then 2016 3.2</text>
  <text start="419" dur="5.31">popped up to three point three and then</text>
  <text start="421.28" dur="5.81">dropped the three point one around 2017</text>
  <text start="424.31" dur="6.109">2018 but of course</text>
  <text start="427.09" dur="6.9">their forecasts were way up there so if</text>
  <text start="430.419" dur="7.141">you look they&amp;#39;ve been declining since</text>
  <text start="433.99" dur="7.86">the financial crisis Trump wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="437.56" dur="8.49">president in 2011 in 2012 13 14 15 and</text>
  <text start="441.85" dur="10.319">actually if you look at 2013 2014 2015</text>
  <text start="446.05" dur="9.03">2016 they&amp;#39;re around between 3.1 and 3.4</text>
  <text start="452.169" dur="6.651">percent where are they today the same</text>
  <text start="455.08" dur="6.75">exact area but the trajectory is</text>
  <text start="458.82" dur="5.86">declining and it&amp;#39;s been declining way</text>
  <text start="461.83" dur="5.94">before Trump and the tariffs so we know</text>
  <text start="464.68" dur="5.43">the IMF is not really being truthful</text>
  <text start="467.77" dur="3.119">about this but think about what has</text>
  <text start="470.11" dur="3.39">happened here</text>
  <text start="470.889" dur="5.701">once again they&amp;#39;re trapped they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="473.5" dur="5.58">trapped in this narrative because once</text>
  <text start="476.59" dur="6.799">the deal is made the tariffs are removed</text>
  <text start="479.08" dur="8.25">one by one what is the IMF going to say</text>
  <text start="483.389" dur="6.311">now the IMF came out and they said</text>
  <text start="487.33" dur="4.92">listen we&amp;#39;re gonna recalculate the GDP</text>
  <text start="489.7" dur="5.79">numbers they were at three point six</text>
  <text start="492.25" dur="4.49">percent there now 3.2 percent would</text>
  <text start="495.49" dur="4.26">probably go a little bit lower than that</text>
  <text start="496.74" dur="4.81">but what they&amp;#39;re saying is that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="499.75" dur="3.63">slowing and they&amp;#39;re trying to blame it</text>
  <text start="501.55" dur="3.96">on tariffs the only good news here is</text>
  <text start="503.38" dur="4.14">that while they&amp;#39;re saying the tariffs</text>
  <text start="505.51" dur="2.88">are affecting the rest of the world the</text>
  <text start="507.52" dur="4.829">United States</text>
  <text start="508.39" dur="8.25">it looks like the forecast for the u.s.</text>
  <text start="512.349" dur="5.671">is a lot better why well they cited the</text>
  <text start="516.64" dur="4.5">expectations that the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="518.02" dur="5.55">will cut interest rates so cutting</text>
  <text start="521.14" dur="5.76">interest rates of the IMF is a good</text>
  <text start="523.57" dur="6.21">thing or is it another trap yes we know</text>
  <text start="526.9" dur="5.9">that Trump needs the rates cut to keep</text>
  <text start="529.78" dur="5.64">the economy moving along the IMF</text>
  <text start="532.8" dur="4.96">realizes that if they cut rates the</text>
  <text start="535.42" dur="5.13">economy will continually will continue</text>
  <text start="537.76" dur="4.68">on chugging along it won&amp;#39;t crash so</text>
  <text start="540.55" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;re off the hook for a little while</text>
  <text start="542.44" dur="7.17">but once he&amp;#39;s reelected in 2020</text>
  <text start="546.43" dur="5.55">and things change and there&amp;#39;s no tariffs</text>
  <text start="549.61" dur="6.21">and there&amp;#39;s trade with other countries</text>
  <text start="551.98" dur="6.27">and the rates start to move up what is</text>
  <text start="555.82" dur="4.38">the IMF going to do at this time</text>
  <text start="558.25" dur="2.279">what is the Fed going to do what is the</text>
  <text start="560.2" dur="3.66">main</text>
  <text start="560.529" dur="5.31">Media going to do actually if you really</text>
  <text start="563.86" dur="4.86">look at it and you step back they are</text>
  <text start="565.839" dur="4.891">completely trapped now because of this</text>
  <text start="568.72" dur="5.25">global slowdown and this is to how the</text>
  <text start="570.73" dur="5.64">central bank system works it&amp;#39;s great in</text>
  <text start="573.97" dur="6.239">the beginning because everyone feels the</text>
  <text start="576.37" dur="7.17">effect of inflation so they think wow my</text>
  <text start="580.209" dur="5.341">salary went up my home went up this is</text>
  <text start="583.54" dur="6.06">fantastic and the interest rates there</text>
  <text start="585.55" dur="6.449">at 15 16 17 % I love it but at the end</text>
  <text start="589.6" dur="4.649">of the system it is absolutely awful</text>
  <text start="591.999" dur="6.21">people can&amp;#39;t find jobs wages are</text>
  <text start="594.249" dur="8.82">declining inflation there is inflation</text>
  <text start="598.209" dur="9.141">but it&amp;#39;s hidden and no one&amp;#39;s earning</text>
  <text start="603.069" dur="6.601">anything on their savings everything is</text>
  <text start="607.35" dur="5.709">completely opposite of what it was like</text>
  <text start="609.67" dur="7.44">when the system first came out line and</text>
  <text start="613.059" dur="6.541">what we see is jobs being lost across</text>
