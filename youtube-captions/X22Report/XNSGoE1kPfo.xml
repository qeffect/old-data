  <text start="42.19" dur="6.45">is US government economic recovery is</text>
  <text start="44.98" dur="5.85">one big manipulation let&amp;#39;s get right</text>
  <text start="48.64" dur="5.22">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="50.83" dur="4.65">news now as we know the US government</text>
  <text start="53.86" dur="3.93">continually puts out their unemployment</text>
  <text start="55.48" dur="3.87">numbers and they try to convince the</text>
  <text start="57.79" dur="3.03">United States the people of the United</text>
  <text start="59.35" dur="2.91">States in the world that everything is</text>
  <text start="60.82" dur="3.39">fine here unemployment down to five</text>
  <text start="62.26" dur="3.57">percent I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if it</text>
  <text start="64.21" dur="3.329">drops down to four point nine four point</text>
  <text start="65.83" dur="3.48">eight percent once again right before</text>
  <text start="67.539" dur="3.72">elections to make it look really really</text>
  <text start="69.31" dur="4.77">good and the US government</text>
  <text start="71.259" dur="7.171">continually tells us that they keep</text>
  <text start="74.08" dur="7.53">adding jobs to retail as we keep</text>
  <text start="78.43" dur="6.56">reporting there&amp;#39;s bankruptcies store</text>
  <text start="81.61" dur="5.819">closures and those numbers make no sense</text>
  <text start="84.99" dur="5.26">well we&amp;#39;re starting to get information</text>
  <text start="87.429" dur="6.561">that&amp;#39;s coming out from credit Swiss that</text>
  <text start="90.25" dur="6.33">this year in 2016 there were more than</text>
  <text start="93.99" dur="6.7">24,000 retail sector jobs that were cut</text>
  <text start="96.58" dur="9.48">in 2016 now we haven&amp;#39;t finished 2016</text>
  <text start="100.69" dur="8.33">right now we&amp;#39;re only in April so when we</text>
  <text start="106.06" dur="7.74">look at this number and we compare it to</text>
  <text start="109.02" dur="7.689">2009-2010 we had about 30,000 273</text>
  <text start="113.8" dur="5.76">layoffs right now we&amp;#39;re at 24,000 a</text>
  <text start="116.709" dur="8.03">credit Swiss is saying that their</text>
  <text start="119.56" dur="10.44">projections for this year could be over</text>
  <text start="124.739" dur="8.651">37,000 layoffs or it could be much much</text>
  <text start="130" dur="6.15">higher because as we discussed on Friday</text>
  <text start="133.39" dur="4.709">there are a lot of stores that are</text>
  <text start="136.15" dur="5.04">filing for bankruptcy there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="138.099" dur="6.511">stores that are closing so what this</text>
  <text start="141.19" dur="6.09">shows us is that something is not right</text>
  <text start="144.61" dur="3.93">once again now it&amp;#39;s either credit sis&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="147.28" dur="3.09">lying because they just came out and</text>
  <text start="148.54" dur="3.21">said hey you know we&amp;#39;re seeing all these</text>
  <text start="150.37" dur="3.39">layoffs from retail why would they lie</text>
  <text start="151.75" dur="5.459">about that it makes no sense or the</text>
  <text start="153.76" dur="4.979">government is lying to the people now we</text>
  <text start="157.209" dur="3.42">hear a lot of people out there saying</text>
  <text start="158.739" dur="4.381">yeah these unemployment numbers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="160.629" dur="4.08">fake phony and false and we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="163.12" dur="3.39">to get a</text>
  <text start="164.709" dur="2.911">this information that&amp;#39;s coming in and</text>
  <text start="166.51" dur="3.809">we&amp;#39;re starting to put the pieces</text>
  <text start="167.62" dur="5.28">together and it&amp;#39;s forming this picture</text>
  <text start="170.319" dur="5.241">and it shows us that yeah the government</text>
  <text start="172.9" dur="6.869">is lying to the people because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="175.56" dur="6.519">completely impossible for retail to be</text>
  <text start="179.769" dur="4.381">expanding with all these employees</text>
  <text start="182.079" dur="4.89">especially during this period of the</text>
  <text start="184.15" dur="5.489">year anyhow which is the slow period of</text>
  <text start="186.969" dur="4.651">time when we see the bankruptcies when</text>
  <text start="189.639" dur="3.72">we see the store closures when we see</text>
  <text start="191.62" dur="4.83">everything starting to shut down</text>
  <text start="193.359" dur="4.8">and then here we have credit Swiss out</text>
  <text start="196.45" dur="5.489">there showing us a completely different</text>
  <text start="198.159" dur="6.811">story so this shows us that this entire</text>
  <text start="201.939" dur="4.97">economy is one big manipulation actually</text>
  <text start="204.97" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re exposed right now of</text>
  <text start="206.909" dur="5.741">manipulating the entire economy we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="210.01" dur="4.349">starting to see cracks in the housing</text>
  <text start="212.65" dur="4.649">recovery actually there was never a</text>
  <text start="214.359" dur="4.921">housing recovery it was one gigantic</text>
  <text start="217.299" dur="5.071">bubble they were able to keep the</text>
  <text start="219.28" dur="5.28">recovery alive and the bubble alive in</text>
  <text start="222.37" dur="4.47">certain cities now they couldn&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="224.56" dur="5.069">for the entire country because it would</text>
  <text start="226.84" dur="4.709">just be way way too hard to do this and</text>
  <text start="229.629" dur="4.021">also they would need the help of the</text>
  <text start="231.549" dur="3.451">American person now the American person</text>
  <text start="233.65" dur="2.85">is completely tapped out we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="235" dur="4.019">more and more layoffs coming down the</text>
  <text start="236.5" dur="4.079">pike these people cannot find jobs and</text>
  <text start="239.019" dur="2.761">believe me the last thing on their minds</text>
  <text start="240.579" dur="3.69">is saying hey you know what I want to go</text>
  <text start="241.78" dur="4.349">out and buy a house this is why Bank of</text>
  <text start="244.269" dur="3.42">America Wells Fargo and all the other</text>
  <text start="246.129" dur="4.08">financial institutions decided to lay</text>
  <text start="247.689" dur="4.92">off thousands upon people thousands and</text>
  <text start="250.209" dur="4.74">thousands of people in their mortgage</text>
  <text start="252.609" dur="6">departments and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="254.949" dur="5.25">now is that permits and starts well</text>
  <text start="258.609" dur="4.141">they&amp;#39;re starting to roll over new home</text>
  <text start="260.199" dur="4.051">sales they printed at about a five</text>
  <text start="262.75" dur="2.61">hundred and eleven thousand verse to</text>
  <text start="264.25" dur="4.199">five hundred and twenty thousand</text>
  <text start="265.36" dur="5.369">expected there was a drop of about 1.5</text>
  <text start="268.449" dur="6.301">percent month on month this is the third</text>
  <text start="270.729" dur="5.581">month in a row that it has declined now</text>
  <text start="274.75" dur="5.19">this is the longest such streak since</text>
  <text start="276.31" dur="5.16">July 2011 the West saw new home sales</text>
  <text start="279.94" dur="4.44">plunged by twenty three point six</text>
  <text start="281.47" dur="4.89">percent and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that</text>
  <text start="284.38" dur="4.469">prices are coming down now I took a look</text>
  <text start="286.36" dur="4.559">around the entire country yes there are</text>
  <text start="288.849" dur="2.491">still hot spots in the country but guess</text>
  <text start="290.919" dur="3.75">what</text>
  <text start="291.34" dur="5.579">those are disappearing very very quickly</text>
  <text start="294.669" dur="4.261">I&amp;#39;m starting to see the outskirts in</text>
  <text start="296.919" dur="5.52">those areas start to</text>
  <text start="298.93" dur="5.04">come inward into those cities and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="302.439" dur="3.57">starting to see that houses are on the</text>
  <text start="303.97" dur="4.319">market longer and longer prices are</text>
  <text start="306.009" dur="6.991">coming down and the whole entire housing</text>
  <text start="308.289" dur="8.06">recovery is just that it&amp;#39;s manipulated</text>
  <text start="313" dur="6.689">it&amp;#39;s fake it&amp;#39;s phony it&amp;#39;s false and</text>
  <text start="316.349" dur="6.461">we&amp;#39;re starting to see that this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="319.689" dur="6.57">going to last that much longer it</text>
  <text start="322.81" dur="6.03">reminds me once again of 2007 going into</text>
  <text start="326.259" dur="5.31">2008 it feels like we&amp;#39;re duplicating</text>
  <text start="328.84" dur="5.549">what happened there now we know the</text>
  <text start="331.569" dur="4.141">Philly Fed the Empire State they have</text>
  <text start="334.389" dur="4.261">their their numbers are completely</text>
  <text start="335.71" dur="5.82">declining we know we had that one little</text>
  <text start="338.65" dur="3.87">pump up with the Philly Fed and now we</text>
  <text start="341.53" dur="4.979">look at the Dallas Fed Manufacturing</text>
  <text start="342.52" dur="7.049">survey well they were only expecting a</text>
  <text start="346.509" dur="5.91">negative 10 which is terrible in itself</text>
  <text start="349.569" dur="5.31">but it declined by negative 13 point 9</text>
  <text start="352.419" dur="6.571">now this is the 16th consecutive month</text>
  <text start="354.879" dur="6.72">in contraction and this is a very bad</text>
  <text start="358.99" dur="5.97">time for manufacturing agriculture</text>
  <text start="361.599" dur="5.66">mining and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that</text>
  <text start="364.96" dur="5.579">things are really starting to break down</text>
  <text start="367.259" dur="5.201">the Dallas Fed says most of our clients</text>
  <text start="370.539" dur="4.38">are reporting slower sales heading into</text>
  <text start="372.46" dur="7.23">the second quarter and expect further</text>
  <text start="374.919" dur="6.78">slowing into the next quarters so this</text>
  <text start="379.69" dur="5.699">shows us right now that things are</text>
  <text start="381.699" dur="4.321">rapidly rapidly falling apart it is not</text>
  <text start="385.389" dur="3.09">getting better</text>
  <text start="386.02" dur="4.739">yes are we gonna see these seasonally</text>
  <text start="388.479" dur="5.55">adjusted numbers are we gonna see</text>
  <text start="390.759" dur="5.13">seasonally adjusted sales we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="394.029" dur="3.42">see little bump ups here and there but</text>
  <text start="395.889" dur="3.59">when you really look at the bump ups</text>
  <text start="397.449" dur="4.56">that we do see coming down the line</text>
  <text start="399.479" dur="3.91">they&amp;#39;re not gonna really do anything</text>
  <text start="402.009" dur="2.641">because what&amp;#39;s gonna happen is right</text>
  <text start="403.389" dur="3">after that little bump up like we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="404.65" dur="5.639">been seeing it comes straight back down</text>
  <text start="406.389" dur="7.231">and this shows us that this economy is</text>
  <text start="410.289" dur="7.74">struggling at this point it shows us</text>
  <text start="413.62" dur="6.269">that consistently over time it is</text>
  <text start="418.029" dur="4.711">declining it is not getting better</text>
  <text start="419.889" dur="4.83">whatsoever now the US government central</text>
  <text start="422.74" dur="4.229">bankers they can tell us that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="424.719" dur="3.42">getting better they can say yes in the</text>
  <text start="426.969" dur="3.87">fourth quarter everything&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="428.139" dur="4.141">picking up and then in 2017 it</text>
  <text start="430.839" dur="4.281">everything&amp;#39;s going to be fantastic</text>
  <text start="432.28" dur="6.48">they&amp;#39;ve been saying this since 2008 and</text>
  <text start="435.12" dur="6.54">they pumped it up with all their free</text>
  <text start="438.76" dur="6.57">money they created all these bubbles and</text>
  <text start="441.66" dur="5.29">since 2013 or so they&amp;#39;ve been saying it</text>
  <text start="445.33" dur="3.39">2014 it&amp;#39;s gonna be the year the economy</text>
  <text start="446.95" dur="3.87">takes off 2015 is gonna be the year the</text>
  <text start="448.72" dur="3.419">economy takes off 2016 is gonna be the</text>
  <text start="450.82" dur="3.93">year the economy takes off and guess</text>
  <text start="452.139" dur="5.161">what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing decline decline</text>
  <text start="454.75" dur="5.1">again getting worse er decline again</text>
  <text start="457.3" dur="6">getting even worse decline again and</text>
  <text start="459.85" dur="5.88">it&amp;#39;s continually happening so everything</text>
  <text start="463.3" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re telling us we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="465.73" dur="5.939">opposite effect now we realize here in</text>
  <text start="469.27" dur="5.07">the United States the central bank the</text>
  <text start="471.669" dur="4.621">banking system they have been given free</text>
  <text start="474.34" dur="5.85">money or they&amp;#39;re creating free money and</text>
  <text start="476.29" dur="5.85">they&amp;#39;re purchasing stocks to pump up the</text>
  <text start="480.19" dur="3.51">market we know the plunge Protection</text>
  <text start="482.14" dur="3">team that&amp;#39;s exactly what they do they</text>
  <text start="483.7" dur="2.94">get the free money from the Fed they</text>
  <text start="485.14" dur="5.22">pump it into the market they buy stocks</text>
  <text start="486.64" dur="5.999">and they keep the market alive well</text>
  <text start="490.36" dur="4.05">Japan they&amp;#39;ve been doing this for quite</text>
  <text start="492.639" dur="5.881">a while and then we come to find out</text>
  <text start="494.41" dur="6.63">that the Bank of Japan is now a top ten</text>
  <text start="498.52" dur="6.42">holder in ninety percent of the Japanese</text>
  <text start="501.04" dur="7.26">stock they&amp;#39;ve been purchasing stock left</text>
  <text start="504.94" dur="6.59">and right to keep the market alive this</text>
  <text start="508.3" dur="9.03">whole thing is one gigantic manipulation</text>
  <text start="511.53" dur="10.15">it&amp;#39;s a bubble that is going to pop now</text>
  <text start="517.33" dur="9.72">Mario Draghi he was out there and he</text>
  <text start="521.68" dur="9.99">said something very interesting that the</text>
  <text start="527.05" dur="6.87">ECB has the right the means and the</text>
  <text start="531.67" dur="6.12">wherewithal to purchase corporate debt</text>
  <text start="533.92" dur="7.65">as it sees fit so why is this such a</text>
  <text start="537.79" dur="7.41">concern well we saw this happen here in</text>
  <text start="541.57" dur="6.96">the United States with GM but GM was a</text>
  <text start="545.2" dur="5.1">little different GM was like an isolated</text>
  <text start="548.53" dur="5.1">event I know we did with AIG with the</text>
  <text start="550.3" dur="6.9">bailouts and things like that but what</text>
  <text start="553.63" dur="9.95">he is saying is that he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="557.2" dur="6.38">decide which companies and how much</text>
  <text start="564.02" dur="6.72">and what he&amp;#39;s doing right now is trying</text>
  <text start="567.68" dur="6.8">to continually prop up the entire system</text>
  <text start="570.74" dur="6.81">because everything else is failing and</text>
  <text start="574.48" dur="5.859">this is going to fail also because she</text>
  <text start="577.55" dur="5.28">just can&amp;#39;t create money and buy things</text>
  <text start="580.339" dur="5.071">up you just create bubble after bubble</text>
  <text start="582.83" dur="6.54">after bubble and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="585.41" dur="5.369">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="589.37" dur="3.54">going to end well when this whole thing</text>
  <text start="590.779" dur="3.661">pops actually it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="592.91" dur="3.69">complete disaster and we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="594.44" dur="3.959">closer and closer to this now there are</text>
  <text start="596.6" dur="3.299">certain people that are already feeling</text>
  <text start="598.399" dur="2.911">the effects of the collapse other people</text>
  <text start="599.899" dur="2.94">that has still have their jobs they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="601.31" dur="2.82">scratching their head saying I don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="612.61" dur="4.3">economy and what it&amp;#39;s like in the job</text>
  <text start="615.589" dur="3.81">market because I have a lot of people</text>

  <text start="651.8" dur="6.18">right now we see Russia and China</text>
  <text start="655.31" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re taking their oil Alliance to a</text>
  <text start="657.98" dur="5.729">whole new level right now China is going</text>
  <text start="660.44" dur="4.26">to be purchasing purchasing part of</text>
  <text start="663.709" dur="2.431">Rosneft</text>
  <text start="664.7" dur="7.65">they&amp;#39;re gonna be coming a major</text>
  <text start="666.14" dur="9.9">shareholder to have access to more of it</text>
  <text start="672.35" dur="5.97">and Ross Neff is Russia&amp;#39;s biggest oil</text>
  <text start="676.04" dur="4.85">producer so we see Russia and China</text>
  <text start="678.32" dur="4.8">moving closer and closer together</text>
  <text start="680.89" dur="4.75">separating themselves from the u.s.</text>
  <text start="683.12" dur="3.6">separating themselves from the US dollar</text>
  <text start="685.64" dur="3.3">now</text>
  <text start="686.72" dur="4.679">many nations have been actively turning</text>
  <text start="688.94" dur="3.899">their back on the dollar now why would</text>
  <text start="691.399" dur="2.43">they do this why would they turn their</text>
  <text start="692.839" dur="2.521">back on the dollar because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="693.829" dur="3.331">starting to realize that the United</text>
  <text start="695.36" dur="2.25">States the central bank of the United</text>
  <text start="697.16" dur="3.26">States</text>
  <text start="697.61" dur="7.38">they benefit the most from the dollar</text>
  <text start="700.42" dur="7.62">and the smaller countries other</text>
  <text start="704.99" dur="5.76">countries they are added this advantage</text>
  <text start="708.04" dur="4.66">so why would nations want to pay for the</text>
  <text start="710.75" dur="4.529">privilege of having to settle</text>
  <text start="712.7" dur="5.91">international trade in dollars when they</text>
  <text start="715.279" dur="7.951">can use their own currency or maybe gold</text>
  <text start="718.61" dur="6.12">or something else and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="723.23" dur="4.109">see that countries are saying you know</text>
  <text start="724.73" dur="5.039">something what do I even get from my</text>
  <text start="727.339" dur="5.911">dollars the u.s. really doesn&amp;#39;t produce</text>
  <text start="729.769" dur="7.32">that much there&amp;#39;s nothing there that I</text>
  <text start="733.25" dur="6.54">want so why am I using the dollar for</text>
  <text start="737.089" dur="5.94">international trade it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="739.79" dur="3.69">why don&amp;#39;t I use my own currency and this</text>
  <text start="743.029" dur="4.771">way</text>
  <text start="743.48" dur="7.53">I don&amp;#39;t have to pay it works out better</text>
  <text start="747.8" dur="5.94">for me and this is why we see the BRIC</text>
  <text start="751.01" dur="5.46">system doing this and many other</text>
  <text start="753.74" dur="5.94">countries are now latching on to this</text>
  <text start="756.47" dur="5.13">and this is going to continue as time</text>
  <text start="759.68" dur="3.81">goes on and this is what the US</text>
  <text start="761.6" dur="3.84">government central bankers are very</text>
  <text start="763.49" dur="4.86">worried about because as more and more</text>
  <text start="765.44" dur="5.73">countries do this as the Middle Eastern</text>
  <text start="768.35" dur="6.239">countries step away from using the petro</text>
  <text start="771.17" dur="5.7">dollar on their natural resources which</text>
  <text start="774.589" dur="4.081">affects the dollar because that means</text>
  <text start="776.87" dur="3.899">countries don&amp;#39;t have to hold the dollar</text>
  <text start="778.67" dur="3.69">in reserves that means more dollars flow</text>
  <text start="780.769" dur="3.271">back to the United States which means</text>
  <text start="782.36" dur="3.659">more dollars in circulation which means</text>
  <text start="784.04" dur="3.87">the value of the dollar decreases which</text>
  <text start="786.019" dur="4.621">means we see hyperinflation here or</text>
  <text start="787.91" dur="7.26">inflation and then it turns into</text>
  <text start="790.64" dur="5.819">hyperinflation and we are already seeing</text>
  <text start="795.17" dur="4.26">this in the United States government</text>
  <text start="796.459" dur="4.801">central bankers once this happens they</text>
  <text start="799.43" dur="4.44">know that this whole entire system is</text>
  <text start="801.26" dur="5.16">doomed they know it&amp;#39;s going to collapse</text>
  <text start="803.87" dur="3.659">and we can see already through all the</text>
  <text start="806.42" dur="3.21">economic indicators that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="807.529" dur="4.981">looking at is that things are starting</text>
  <text start="809.63" dur="5.069">to rapidly fall apart there&amp;#39;s no way of</text>
  <text start="812.51" dur="3.689">pretending that the economy&amp;#39;s doing well</text>
  <text start="814.699" dur="3.361">yes they can keep the stock market</text>
  <text start="816.199" dur="4.441">pumped up they&amp;#39;re even having trouble</text>
  <text start="818.06" dur="3.99">now suppressing gold and silver they</text>
  <text start="820.64" dur="3.66">suppress it a little bit and it rises</text>
  <text start="822.05" dur="4.769">right back up so we&amp;#39;re already seeing</text>
  <text start="824.3" dur="5.07">signs that this is getting harder and</text>
  <text start="826.819" dur="4.761">harder to manipulate and this makes them</text>
  <text start="829.37" dur="5.3">very very worried</text>
  <text start="831.58" dur="5.58">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now as we go</text>
  <text start="834.67" dur="4.38">into more and more of the months in this</text>
  <text start="837.16" dur="3.39">year we&amp;#39;re starting to see that things</text>
  <text start="839.05" dur="4.92">are really starting to accelerate things</text>
  <text start="840.55" dur="5.46">are not improving and the collapse it is</text>
  <text start="843.97" dur="3.84">just right there right in front of us</text>
  <text start="846.01" dur="3.54">when the whole entire system just</text>
  <text start="847.81" dur="5.58">completely comes to a screeching halt</text>
  <text start="849.55" dur="4.77">and this is why you need to be prepared</text>
