  <text start="91.94" dur="5.039">changing rules for the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="93.86" dur="5.579">and the bad guys within the Federal</text>

  <text start="101.899" dur="5.22">and you can see there&amp;#39;s a battle going</text>
  <text start="104.81" dur="4.26">on between what Trump and his</text>
  <text start="107.119" dur="4.801">administration wants to do and how they</text>
  <text start="109.07" dur="4.619">want to restructure the Fed and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="111.92" dur="4.65">starting off with these beginning phases</text>
  <text start="113.689" dur="5.671">of okay we&amp;#39;re changing laws here you</text>
  <text start="116.57" dur="5.49">need to follow this but guess what they</text>
  <text start="119.36" dur="4.679">don&amp;#39;t want to do this we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="122.06" dur="3.36">talking about that in just a minute but</text>
  <text start="124.039" dur="2.701">first I wanted to talk about what is</text>
  <text start="125.42" dur="3.03">happening in the economy and we know</text>
  <text start="126.74" dur="3.51">that there&amp;#39;s two things happening in the</text>
  <text start="128.45" dur="3.48">economy one we have the central bank</text>
  <text start="130.25" dur="3.57">economy which Trump is trying to keep</text>
  <text start="131.93" dur="4.589">alive long enough so he can get</text>
  <text start="133.82" dur="5.85">reelected the other thing he&amp;#39;s doing is</text>
  <text start="136.519" dur="6.931">he&amp;#39;s changing everything that we know</text>
  <text start="139.67" dur="7.349">about the economy because the economy is</text>
  <text start="143.45" dur="5.52">based on the central bank system we are</text>
  <text start="147.019" dur="4.831">going to be moving out of the central</text>
  <text start="148.97" dur="5.519">bank system into a people&amp;#39;s economy</text>
  <text start="151.85" dur="6.06">where people control the economy not a</text>
  <text start="154.489" dur="6.481">private organization but what we see</text>
  <text start="157.91" dur="6.6">happening is is that personal spending</text>
  <text start="160.97" dur="5.879">it has gone up by 0.9% now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="164.51" dur="3.509">good people are out going out there that</text>
  <text start="166.849" dur="3.75">feeling comfortable they&amp;#39;re going out</text>
  <text start="168.019" dur="6.931">and they&amp;#39;re spending the problem is is</text>
  <text start="170.599" dur="7.17">that people are taking their currency</text>
  <text start="174.95" dur="4.89">out of the banking system their savings</text>
  <text start="177.769" dur="4.881">and they&amp;#39;re using it to spend which</text>
  <text start="179.84" dur="5.91">means they&amp;#39;re not bringing in enough</text>
  <text start="182.65" dur="5.77">where they can save and spend at the</text>
  <text start="185.75" dur="5.909">same time now this is the biggest rise</text>
  <text start="188.42" dur="5.849">since August 2009 I mean on a</text>
  <text start="191.659" dur="5.101">year-over-year basis spending has</text>
  <text start="194.269" dur="4.05">accelerated beyond income growth once</text>
  <text start="196.76" dur="5.759">again so people are out there spending</text>
  <text start="198.319" dur="5.581">and income growth is not keeping up now</text>
  <text start="202.519" dur="3.541">this is going to be a problem moving</text>
  <text start="203.9" dur="5.04">forward but this is how the central bank</text>
  <text start="206.06" dur="5.34">system works in the beginning when we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="208.94" dur="6.659">coming off a sound money system where</text>
  <text start="211.4" dur="5.91">we&amp;#39;re connected to gold well the central</text>
  <text start="215.599" dur="5.551">bank creates a lot of currency which</text>
  <text start="217.31" dur="5.73">creates inflation people think that they</text>
  <text start="221.15" dur="4.679">have a lot more than they really do and</text>
  <text start="223.04" dur="5.039">they see their house price go up they</text>
  <text start="225.829" dur="3.601">see their wages go up they see a lot of</text>
  <text start="228.079" dur="3.541">things happening so they feel good in</text>
  <text start="229.43" dur="4.29">the beginning stages and during this</text>
  <text start="231.62" dur="3.6">period of time the central bank then has</text>
  <text start="233.72" dur="4.37">to introduce credit and they feel even</text>
  <text start="235.22" dur="6.389">better but at the end stage of the</text>
  <text start="238.09" dur="5.259">central bank system wages well they</text>
  <text start="241.609" dur="3.151">really don&amp;#39;t move anywhere it pretty</text>
  <text start="243.349" dur="4.2">much stay flattened a lot of times they</text>
  <text start="244.76" dur="6">decline why because all the high paying</text>
  <text start="247.549" dur="5.31">jobs were moved out of this country the</text>
  <text start="250.76" dur="3.36">reason for this is because the central</text>
  <text start="252.859" dur="3.78">bank system only lasts for a certain</text>
  <text start="254.12" dur="4.5">period of time and what they need to do</text>
  <text start="256.639" dur="3.75">is they need to shift everything to</text>
  <text start="258.62" dur="3.66">another country and this is what they</text>
  <text start="260.389" dur="3.331">were planning to do they were planning</text>
  <text start="262.28" dur="3.78">to shift everything out of the United</text>
  <text start="263.72" dur="5.49">States Trump is doing the opposite of</text>
  <text start="266.06" dur="5.4">what the central bank wants he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="269.21" dur="4.05">bringing everything back to this country</text>
  <text start="271.46" dur="3.269">he&amp;#39;s doing everything the opposite the</text>
  <text start="273.26" dur="3.42">deep state was trying to do he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="274.729" dur="4.741">bringing manufacturing back</text>
  <text start="276.68" dur="5.94">he&amp;#39;s deregulating he&amp;#39;s making it a</text>
  <text start="279.47" dur="5.37">better environment so businesses can do</text>
  <text start="282.62" dur="4.95">business in the United States and once</text>
  <text start="284.84" dur="5.97">they do this guess what happens other</text>
  <text start="287.57" dur="6.39">businesses open but we need to get out</text>
  <text start="290.81" dur="5.64">of this central bank system so Trump he</text>
  <text start="293.96" dur="4.42">has this mission where he needs to keep</text>
  <text start="296.45" dur="4.51">the central bank system</text>
  <text start="298.38" dur="5.49">operational and this is what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="300.96" dur="5.49">right now this is his plan at the same</text>
  <text start="303.87" dur="5.1">time he needs to start bringing and</text>
  <text start="306.45" dur="5.25">deregulating and changing the laws so</text>
  <text start="308.97" dur="3.96">corporations manufacturers they all look</text>
  <text start="311.7" dur="3.24">at this and say you know something we</text>
  <text start="312.93" dur="3.99">want to come back here this is the right</text>
  <text start="314.94" dur="4.8">environment for us and he&amp;#39;s doing this</text>
  <text start="316.92" dur="5.25">but he needs to keep the system alive</text>
  <text start="319.74" dur="4.95">and this is what he&amp;#39;s trying to do</text>
  <text start="322.17" dur="4.53">actually he is doing it he&amp;#39;s keeping the</text>
  <text start="324.69" dur="4.77">system alive and the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="326.7" dur="5.4">the deep state they can&amp;#39;t even touch the</text>
  <text start="329.46" dur="3.87">economy I mean think about it they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="332.1" dur="3.87">even know what to do every time</text>

  <text start="356.61" dur="4.89">completely wrong I mean it wasn&amp;#39;t too</text>

  <text start="491.76" dur="4.44">Trump he is pushing for change in the</text>
  <text start="494.729" dur="3.87">Federal Reserve we know this because of</text>
  <text start="496.2" dur="5.54">Q we know this because he has a lot of</text>
  <text start="498.599" dur="5.491">seats open on the Federal Reserve and</text>
  <text start="501.74" dur="4.51">Trump in the Federal Reserve they</text>
  <text start="504.09" dur="5.13">continue to clash over interest rates</text>
  <text start="506.25" dur="5.16">but another simmering dispute concerns</text>
  <text start="509.22" dur="4.05">the regulatory burden the Federal</text>

  <text start="651.18" dur="4.11">banks that have the biggest trading</text>

  <text start="670.41" dur="6.51">conflicts with the law indeed that is an</text>
  <text start="674.579" dur="6.331">illegal encroachment on the legislative</text>
  <text start="676.92" dur="6.84">authority of Congress do you think Trump</text>

  <text start="763.67" dur="4.05">in every country we were there where</text>
  <text start="765.65" dur="6.56">they were fighting off all those people</text>
  <text start="767.72" dur="7.88">that didn&amp;#39;t want a puppet government now</text>
  <text start="772.21" dur="6.16">everything is starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="775.6" dur="6.28">everything that the deep state has done</text>
  <text start="778.37" dur="6.03">is going to be reversed which means once</text>
  <text start="781.88" dur="5.4">the people take control of their</text>
  <text start="784.4" dur="6.21">countries they will know you&amp;#39;ll longer</text>

  <text start="790.61" dur="6.45">oil using whatever currency maybe gold</text>
  <text start="794.54" dur="4.11">silver doesn&amp;#39;t matter they will no</text>
  <text start="797.06" dur="3.27">longer use the petro dollar and this is</text>
  <text start="798.65" dur="5.43">what the central banks are talking about</text>
  <text start="800.33" dur="6.57">the days of the reserve currency which</text>
  <text start="804.08" dur="5.34">is hooked to oil in the Middle East that</text>
  <text start="806.9" dur="6.81">is coming to an end everything that they</text>
  <text start="809.42" dur="8.07">put together in the 70s is now coming to</text>
  <text start="813.71" dur="6.24">an end now the central banks the deep</text>

  <text start="819.95" dur="3.54">going to be an event everything was</text>
  <text start="821.9" dur="3.81">going to be switched away from the</text>
  <text start="823.49" dur="6.18">United States and they were going to</text>
  <text start="825.71" dur="5.05">restart this entire system now they</text>
  <text start="829.67" dur="4.33">don&amp;#39;t have this</text>
  <text start="830.76" dur="4.59">vent this is a problem the central banks</text>
  <text start="834" dur="4.17">are trying to figure out and trying to</text>
  <text start="835.35" dur="5.46">control the narrative and explain what</text>
  <text start="838.17" dur="4.98">is about to happen they can&amp;#39;t explain</text>
  <text start="840.81" dur="4.23">the slowing growth they can&amp;#39;t explain</text>
  <text start="843.15" dur="3.78">why all this is happening yes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="845.04" dur="5.07">using Trump right now to blame this on</text>
  <text start="846.93" dur="5.37">but soon once the China deal is made and</text>
  <text start="850.11" dur="6.27">a couple months after that once the</text>
  <text start="852.3" dur="5.61">tariffs are dropped or reduced they</text>
  <text start="856.38" dur="2.76">can&amp;#39;t even use that and we know that the</text>

  <text start="862.5" dur="6.99">central bank&amp;#39;s system that they created</text>
  <text start="865.67" dur="7.33">their system was never meant to last</text>
  <text start="869.49" dur="5.37">this long their system is driven by debt</text>
  <text start="873" dur="3.75">and when you continually pile on debt</text>
  <text start="874.86" dur="3.78">think about a household if you add debt</text>
  <text start="876.75" dur="4.62">debt debt debt debt and your income</text>
  <text start="878.64" dur="4.35">stays the same what happens it collapses</text>
  <text start="881.37" dur="4.59">if you have a business and they keep</text>
  <text start="882.99" dur="4.71">adding debt and their sales and</text>
  <text start="885.96" dur="3.42">everything else that&amp;#39;s coming in stays</text>

  <text start="899.52" dur="5.61">happens to the central bank system they</text>
  <text start="902.4" dur="4.35">keep adding debt it grows and it grows</text>
  <text start="905.13" dur="4.2">and it grows and guess what the</text>
  <text start="906.75" dur="4.47">population of the world cannot support</text>
  <text start="909.33" dur="6.15">this debt why do you think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="911.22" dur="7.77">looking for more taxes why do you think</text>
  <text start="915.48" dur="7.32">they want carbon tax why do you think</text>
  <text start="918.99" dur="5.73">they want other taxes because this is</text>
  <text start="922.8" dur="5.39">the only way they can keep their system</text>
  <text start="924.72" dur="6.54">going plus keep the people enslaved</text>
