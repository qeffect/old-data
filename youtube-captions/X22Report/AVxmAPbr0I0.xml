  <text start="86.72" dur="3.66">news you know as we know on Friday</text>
  <text start="88.82" dur="4.08">normally the US government central</text>
  <text start="90.38" dur="4.56">bankers they love to push the market up</text>
  <text start="92.9" dur="3.81">as high as they possibly can they using</text>
  <text start="94.94" dur="3.84">the plunge protection team the</text>
  <text start="96.71" dur="3.93">high-frequency traders and they like</text>
  <text start="98.78" dur="5.19">people going into the weekend with a</text>
  <text start="100.64" dur="5.46">feel-good feeling that everything&amp;#39;s okay</text>
  <text start="103.97" dur="4.17">but today it looks like the market</text>
  <text start="106.1" dur="5.16">really didn&amp;#39;t reach where they wanted it</text>
  <text start="108.14" dur="5.82">to go up a little bit gold is up a</text>
  <text start="111.26" dur="4.29">little bit and from yesterday being down</text>
  <text start="113.96" dur="3.66">really the market really has gone</text>
  <text start="115.55" dur="3.96">nowhere at this point and we can see</text>
  <text start="117.62" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s becoming more and more difficult to</text>
  <text start="119.51" dur="3.87">keep this market alive it&amp;#39;s fluctuating</text>
  <text start="121.34" dur="4.97">on top we saw this back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="123.38" dur="5.73">eight we saw it back in 2001 1929 and</text>
  <text start="126.31" dur="6.85">we&amp;#39;re heading down that road right once</text>
  <text start="129.11" dur="9.48">again where the market and the entire</text>
  <text start="133.16" dur="7.82">economy is going to eventually just fall</text>
  <text start="138.59" dur="6.57">apart people are going to notice and</text>
  <text start="140.98" dur="6.899">we&amp;#39;re starting to see that there are</text>
  <text start="145.16" dur="6.27">certain officials in cities where</text>
  <text start="147.879" dur="7.631">they&amp;#39;re trying to hide the homeless</text>
  <text start="151.43" dur="8.22">people because they&amp;#39;re passing crazy</text>
  <text start="155.51" dur="6.87">laws and they&amp;#39;re hoping that the</text>
  <text start="159.65" dur="4.75">homeless would leave the cities now I</text>
  <text start="162.38" dur="3.969">know there&amp;#39;s a lot of cleanup where</text>
  <text start="164.4" dur="3.21">cities are coming in trying to push the</text>
  <text start="166.349" dur="3.271">homeless in all different areas and</text>
  <text start="167.61" dur="5.25">remember these are people that had jobs</text>
  <text start="169.62" dur="5.449">before they lost their job they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="172.86" dur="5.549">trying to get a job and what happens</text>
  <text start="175.069" dur="5.471">they lose their homes and there are</text>
  <text start="178.409" dur="5.401">others that you know have other problems</text>
  <text start="180.54" dur="6.449">mental drugs and things like that but la</text>
  <text start="183.81" dur="6.179">is passing this new law saying that the</text>
  <text start="186.989" dur="6.151">homeless person must fit everything into</text>
  <text start="189.989" dur="6.89">a trash can and only can be a 60 gallon</text>
  <text start="193.14" dur="5.819">trash can and the lid must close now</text>
  <text start="196.879" dur="4.541">most of the time homeless people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="198.959" dur="3.81">have that much anyhow but what you see</text>
  <text start="201.42" dur="4.08">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="202.769" dur="6.511">to force people out of the area now</text>
  <text start="205.5" dur="5.37">there are other parts of this law where</text>
  <text start="209.28" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re saying that they cannot have</text>
  <text start="210.87" dur="8.759">tents and they want tends to be taken</text>
  <text start="214.92" dur="7.319">down and they&amp;#39;re saying that we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="219.629" dur="5.61">have this in the city now taking away</text>
  <text start="222.239" dur="5.941">people&amp;#39;s belongings taking away a tent</text>
  <text start="225.239" dur="5.4">or anything else that they you know put</text>
  <text start="228.18" dur="4.5">up to live in at this point is not going</text>
  <text start="230.639" dur="4.47">to help them because what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="232.68" dur="4.769">right now is that the homeless epidemic</text>
  <text start="235.109" dur="6.3">in LA and it&amp;#39;s not just LA to New York</text>
  <text start="237.449" dur="7.29">it&amp;#39;s in Detroit and many other cities</text>
  <text start="241.409" dur="5.79">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now out in</text>
  <text start="244.739" dur="5.071">LA that there&amp;#39;s been an increase of</text>
  <text start="247.199" dur="6.361">about twenty percent over the last two</text>
  <text start="249.81" dur="6.419">years of homeless people and of course</text>
  <text start="253.56" dur="5.34">as we can see as the economy continually</text>
  <text start="256.229" dur="4.021">declines as the economy gets worse we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="258.9" dur="3.03">going to see more and more homeless</text>
  <text start="260.25" dur="4.139">people on the street and they know this</text>
  <text start="261.93" dur="4.5">because they&amp;#39;ve been tracking it they</text>
  <text start="264.389" dur="3.691">realized what&amp;#39;s going on and just like</text>
  <text start="266.43" dur="4.169">New York and Detroit and all these other</text>
  <text start="268.08" dur="4.74">places they want to hide what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="270.599" dur="5.221">going on nobody can see the bread lines</text>
  <text start="272.82" dur="4.95">nobody can see unemployment lines nobody</text>
  <text start="275.82" dur="4.5">can see anything what homeless people</text>
  <text start="277.77" dur="4.38">nubbed is not over here now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="280.32" dur="5.909">starting to see that consumer spending</text>
  <text start="282.15" dur="6.199">that has fallen and bank of america has</text>
  <text start="286.229" dur="4.981">looked at credit and debit cards and</text>
  <text start="288.349" dur="6.07">they look at the spending data and they</text>
  <text start="291.21" dur="5.4">reveal that spending is down once again</text>
  <text start="294.419" dur="3.041">point one percent year-on-year now they</text>
  <text start="296.61" dur="4.42">removed</text>
  <text start="297.46" dur="6.39">auto sales from this and the spending is</text>
  <text start="301.03" dur="5.85">now declining now what are the</text>
  <text start="303.85" dur="5.51">households spend on well they found that</text>
  <text start="306.88" dur="7.2">the biggest expense is food and</text>
  <text start="309.36" dur="9.809">beverages and that was the first item</text>
  <text start="314.08" dur="7.98">the second item was healthcare</text>
  <text start="319.169" dur="5.981">healthcare and I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="322.06" dur="6.9">Obamacare was the second biggest</text>
  <text start="325.15" dur="7.41">category now electronics furniture and</text>
  <text start="328.96" dur="7.29">all those things well that is the least</text>
  <text start="332.56" dur="6.69">of what people have spent on so this</text>
  <text start="336.25" dur="4.889">shows you at this point that people are</text>
  <text start="339.25" dur="5.34">spending money on things that they need</text>
  <text start="341.139" dur="8.971">they need food they need something to</text>
  <text start="344.59" dur="9.48">drink maybe clothing and it&amp;#39;s mandatory</text>
  <text start="350.11" dur="6.48">to have Obamacare and those premiums</text>
  <text start="354.07" dur="4.95">continually rise that is counted in the</text>
  <text start="356.59" dur="4.41">spending calculation and it shows that</text>
  <text start="359.02" dur="3.6">people are spending their money but</text>
  <text start="361" dur="2.97">they&amp;#39;re really not because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="362.62" dur="2.639">really not going out and getting the</text>
  <text start="363.97" dur="4.61">things they really need they are</text>
  <text start="365.259" dur="6.291">spending their money in health care</text>
  <text start="368.58" dur="6.399">where that just completely disappears</text>
  <text start="371.55" dur="5.549">because as we know people have to use</text>
  <text start="374.979" dur="7.141">the deductibles first to get any</text>
  <text start="377.099" dur="8.021">benefits now the most troubling part of</text>
  <text start="382.12" dur="6.169">this is the sharp drop-off in services</text>
  <text start="385.12" dur="6.78">in the past year and we see that</text>
  <text start="388.289" dur="8.011">restaurants hotels airlines the spending</text>
  <text start="391.9" dur="9.199">there has dropped off considerably and</text>
  <text start="396.3" dur="7.54">this shows us that things are actually</text>
  <text start="401.099" dur="5.111">declining at this point and we know</text>
  <text start="403.84" dur="4.859">through the is M services manufacturing</text>
  <text start="406.21" dur="5.04">it is all declining we know from the</text>
  <text start="408.699" dur="6.421">restaurant performance index that it is</text>
  <text start="411.25" dur="8.639">also declining so all signs are pointing</text>
  <text start="415.12" dur="6.829">to this economy collapsing I mean</text>
  <text start="419.889" dur="4.921">everything that we look at it</text>
  <text start="421.949" dur="4.601">continually shows us that things are</text>
  <text start="424.81" dur="4.5">getting worse and worse as time goes on</text>
  <text start="426.55" dur="4.77">the Department of Commerce has reported</text>
  <text start="429.31" dur="3.75">that the latest inventory data</text>
  <text start="431.32" dur="4.29">following major historical reversions</text>
  <text start="433.06" dur="4.95">not only was last month&amp;#39;s inventory</text>
  <text start="435.61" dur="5.88">print / from point three percent to</text>
  <text start="438.01" dur="5.91">point negative 2 percent but the</text>
  <text start="441.49" dur="5.22">februari inventory numbers was a</text>
  <text start="443.92" dur="5.49">dramatic negative point five percent</text>
  <text start="446.71" dur="5.1">drop now it was way below the negative</text>
  <text start="449.41" dur="5.25">point to that they expected and this is</text>
  <text start="451.81" dur="5.82">the biggest sequential drop since 2013</text>
  <text start="454.66" dur="6.6">so once again we are seeing things</text>
  <text start="457.63" dur="6.42">completely fall apart now the Atlanta</text>
  <text start="461.26" dur="4.89">Fed came out and they said hmmm we had</text>
  <text start="464.05" dur="3.42">an estimate and we&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="466.15" dur="3.84">lowering it they were at one percent</text>
  <text start="467.47" dur="5.07">they came at point seven percent they</text>
  <text start="469.99" dur="4.53">were down two-point-four percent and now</text>
  <text start="472.54" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re looking at it and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="474.52" dur="6.24">okay we are now down to point one</text>
  <text start="477.49" dur="5.55">percent of GDP and this is getting worse</text>
  <text start="480.76" dur="4.59">and worse as time goes on now does that</text>
  <text start="483.04" dur="3.44">mean that the u.s. government central</text>
  <text start="485.35" dur="3.6">bankers are going to come out and say oh</text>
  <text start="486.48" dur="3.52">GDP is point one percent now what</text>
  <text start="488.95" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="490" dur="4.08">manipulate these numbers quite a bit to</text>
  <text start="492.52" dur="3.39">make it look like things are doing a lot</text>
  <text start="494.08" dur="3.9">better than might revise the previous</text>
  <text start="495.91" dur="4.29">number way way down to bring this number</text>
  <text start="497.98" dur="4.32">up shift over Obamacare shift over</text>
  <text start="500.2" dur="4.14">inventories do whatever they possibly</text>
  <text start="502.3" dur="4.62">can to keep this number alive but what</text>
  <text start="504.34" dur="4.29">we can see right now is that if we go</text>
  <text start="506.92" dur="5.059">back just I don&amp;#39;t know two three months</text>
  <text start="508.63" dur="8.099">you know what their forecast was for</text>
  <text start="511.979" dur="8.051">2016 the first quarter 2.7% that was</text>
  <text start="516.729" dur="5.701">their forecast because they told us in</text>
  <text start="520.03" dur="4.38">2015 actually if we go back to 24 to</text>
  <text start="522.43" dur="4.05">actually we go back 2013 actually if you</text>
  <text start="524.41" dur="4.53">go back to 2012 they continually say the</text>
  <text start="526.48" dur="4.32">same thing next year the economy&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="528.94" dur="3.42">economy is going to be taking off oh the</text>
  <text start="530.8" dur="4.05">next year the economy is going to be</text>
  <text start="532.36" dur="5.94">taking off it&amp;#39;s going to have liftoff so</text>
  <text start="534.85" dur="5.43">in 2015 as everything started to decline</text>
  <text start="538.3" dur="5.04">at the end of the year they say well one</text>
  <text start="540.28" dur="5.97">2016 comes it&amp;#39;s just going to completely</text>
  <text start="543.34" dur="5.31">lift off it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s going to do much much</text>
  <text start="546.25" dur="4.41">better and we&amp;#39;re predicting that GDP is</text>
  <text start="548.65" dur="6.21">going to be around 2.7% and guess what</text>
  <text start="550.66" dur="8.28">it is not it actually has declined once</text>
  <text start="554.86" dur="6.18">again so Jen&amp;#39;s Albert Edwards is saying</text>
  <text start="558.94" dur="5.19">that you know we really can&amp;#39;t look at</text>
  <text start="561.04" dur="4.19">these fabricated goal seeking data like</text>
  <text start="564.13" dur="3.63">GDP</text>
  <text start="565.23" dur="6.16">inflation unemployment and everything</text>
  <text start="567.76" dur="7.22">else and he discovered precisely what he</text>
  <text start="571.39" dur="6.48">calls a fail-safe recession indicator</text>
  <text start="574.98" dur="5.98">one which has stopped flashing amber and</text>
  <text start="577.87" dur="7.11">now has turned to a red flashing light</text>
  <text start="580.96" dur="6.81">and he&amp;#39;s saying that we need to look at</text>
  <text start="584.98" dur="5.549">the whole economy profits data because</text>
  <text start="587.77" dur="4.74">when we look at this we see five of the</text>
  <text start="590.529" dur="5.161">past six times when corporate profits</text>
  <text start="592.51" dur="7.17">dropped by sixty percent the economy</text>
  <text start="595.69" dur="9.57">entered a recession and we are seeing</text>
  <text start="599.68" dur="10.5">this right now now the Fed was out there</text>
  <text start="605.26" dur="7.94">Janet Yellen and reporters financial</text>
  <text start="610.18" dur="6.48">pundants were asking her questions and</text>
  <text start="613.2" dur="5.92">we&amp;#39;re starting to see what happened back</text>
  <text start="616.66" dur="5.34">in two thousand eight she&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="619.12" dur="4.98">about the economy and I asked if you</text>
  <text start="622" dur="5.01">know the economy is doing fine is it in</text>
  <text start="624.1" dur="5.88">a bubble and she went on to say and I</text>
  <text start="627.01" dur="5.73">quote so I would say the US economy has</text>
  <text start="629.98" dur="4.56">made tremendous progress in recovering</text>
  <text start="632.74" dur="5.19">from the damage from the financial</text>
  <text start="634.54" dur="6.51">crisis uh slowly but surely the labor</text>
  <text start="637.93" dur="6.45">market is healing um for well over a</text>
  <text start="641.05" dur="5.46">year we&amp;#39;ve averaged about 225,000 jobs a</text>
  <text start="644.38" dur="4.32">month the unemployment rate now stands</text>
  <text start="646.51" dur="4.14">at five percent so we&amp;#39;re coming close to</text>
  <text start="648.7" dur="4.62">where our signed congressional goal of</text>
  <text start="650.65" dur="6.18">maximum employment so I think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="653.32" dur="7.11">making progress there as well and this</text>
  <text start="656.83" dur="6.93">is an economy on solid course um not a</text>
  <text start="660.43" dur="5.31">bubble economy um we tried carefully to</text>
  <text start="663.76" dur="4.079">look at the evidence of potential</text>
  <text start="665.74" dur="3.69">financial instability that might be</text>
  <text start="667.839" dur="5.101">brewing and some of the hallmarks of</text>
  <text start="669.43" dur="6.12">that clearly over valued asset prices</text>
  <text start="672.94" dur="5.82">high leverage rising leverage and rapid</text>
  <text start="675.55" dur="7.68">credit growth and we certainly don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="678.76" dur="8.18">those imbalances whatsoever the economy</text>
