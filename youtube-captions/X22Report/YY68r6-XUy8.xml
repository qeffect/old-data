  <text start="72.06" dur="3.72">go as well we&amp;#39;ll talk about that a</text>
  <text start="73.59" dur="6.38">little bit later but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="75.78" dur="8.369">right now is that the illusionary</text>
  <text start="79.97" dur="6.28">economic data is completely going the</text>
  <text start="84.149" dur="5.821">opposite way of the hard data right now</text>
  <text start="86.25" dur="5.7">and those good times after the election</text>
  <text start="89.97" dur="3.87">well if they&amp;#39;re coming to an end and</text>
  <text start="91.95" dur="4.08">we&amp;#39;re still continually seeing the</text>
  <text start="93.84" dur="4.949">fluctuation in the market what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="96.03" dur="4.92">seeing right now is that things are</text>
  <text start="98.789" dur="2.731">rapidly disintegrating right in front of</text>
  <text start="100.95" dur="2.88">our eyes</text>
  <text start="101.52" dur="4.65">now core durable goods with like washers</text>
  <text start="103.83" dur="5.429">dryers the big-ticket items plus there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="106.17" dur="4.77">also military equipment included in this</text>
  <text start="109.259" dur="4.291">and if you strip that out you can see</text>
  <text start="110.94" dur="6.12">core durable goods well it&amp;#39;s a complete</text>
  <text start="113.55" dur="6.689">disaster and what we&amp;#39;ve seen is for 21</text>
  <text start="117.06" dur="6.24">months we&amp;#39;ve seen a huge decline of core</text>
  <text start="120.239" dur="6.211">durable goods except for February where</text>
  <text start="123.3" dur="5.64">all of a sudden it shot up and what</text>
  <text start="126.45" dur="5.49">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now well it is</text>
  <text start="128.94" dur="6.54">heading right back down and it looks</text>
  <text start="131.94" dur="5.909">like it&amp;#39;s a one-off dead cat type of</text>
  <text start="135.48" dur="5.43">bounce and we&amp;#39;re seeing that things are</text>
  <text start="137.849" dur="5.491">starting to disintegrate very quickly</text>
  <text start="140.91" dur="4.439">we&amp;#39;re seeing that the soft data and the</text>
  <text start="143.34" dur="4.05">hard data well they&amp;#39;re going their</text>
  <text start="145.349" dur="5.101">separate ways right now and if we look</text>
  <text start="147.39" dur="4.98">at the manufacturing PMI s we see that</text>
  <text start="150.45" dur="3.78">things are rapidly falling apart both</text>
  <text start="152.37" dur="3.96">manufacturing PMI while they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="154.23" dur="4.11">disappointing they&amp;#39;re tumbling to the</text>
  <text start="156.33" dur="5.129">lowest level since before the election</text>
  <text start="158.34" dur="6">simply put the soft data is converging</text>
  <text start="161.459" dur="6.631">back lower to the dismal reality of the</text>
  <text start="164.34" dur="7.47">hard data and we see manufacturing PMI</text>
  <text start="168.09" dur="6.6">services PMI and all of it well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="171.81" dur="6.09">starting to decline once again output</text>
  <text start="174.69" dur="5.82">has slowed dramatically and we can see</text>
  <text start="177.9" dur="3.3">from market Chris Williams and chief</text>
  <text start="180.51" dur="5.16">business</text>
  <text start="181.2" dur="8.61">animus the US economy shifted to a down</text>
  <text start="185.67" dur="6.12">gear in March and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="189.81" dur="4.74">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now things are</text>
  <text start="191.79" dur="3.99">rapidly deteriorating and falling apart</text>
  <text start="194.55" dur="3.799">right in front of our eyes</text>
  <text start="195.78" dur="6.15">and when we look at the entire situation</text>
  <text start="198.349" dur="5.731">we need to understand that this system</text>
  <text start="201.93" dur="4.32">has been deteriorating and the</text>
  <text start="204.08" dur="6.129">acceleration of the deterioration has</text>
  <text start="206.25" dur="6.78">been faster and faster and faster and as</text>
  <text start="210.209" dur="4.981">we approach the summer months the fall</text>
  <text start="213.03" dur="4.23">months here in United States and around</text>
  <text start="215.19" dur="5.28">the world we&amp;#39;re going to see things</text>
  <text start="217.26" dur="4.53">rapidly change and this is why for a</text>
  <text start="220.47" dur="3.69">very long time we&amp;#39;ve been telling</text>
  <text start="221.79" dur="5.19">everyone to get prepared for what is</text>
  <text start="224.16" dur="6.6">coming because we have to understand</text>
  <text start="226.98" dur="6.78">that the central bank Trump the entire</text>
  <text start="230.76" dur="6.39">system everyone knows that the system</text>
  <text start="233.76" dur="5.61">cannot continue one I mean if you really</text>
  <text start="237.15" dur="3.899">think that we&amp;#39;re in a recovery if you</text>
  <text start="239.37" dur="5.339">really think that the economy is strong</text>
  <text start="241.049" dur="8.791">well you&amp;#39;re going to be in for a rude</text>
  <text start="244.709" dur="7.59">awakening because the system is ripe to</text>
  <text start="249.84" dur="5.61">come down right now we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot</text>
  <text start="252.299" dur="7.53">of the similar signs that we saw back</text>
  <text start="255.45" dur="5.939">prior to 2008 and I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="259.829" dur="4.321">going to come crashing down in a split</text>
  <text start="261.389" dur="5.101">second all at once the economy most</text>
  <text start="264.15" dur="5.25">likely will have some type of Correction</text>
  <text start="266.49" dur="6">maybe 1020 percent where the market does</text>
  <text start="269.4" dur="4.829">come down and of course what the central</text>
  <text start="272.49" dur="4.44">bankers really want to do is they want</text>
  <text start="274.229" dur="5.281">to step back in with QE and I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="276.93" dur="4.56">try to pump it up once again and as the</text>
  <text start="279.51" dur="3.719">market comes down we&amp;#39;re going to see a</text>
  <text start="281.49" dur="4.5">lot of things and I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="283.229" dur="4.861">real economic data the reality of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.99" dur="5.63">going on here well it&amp;#39;s going to start</text>
  <text start="288.09" dur="5.699">to come out and for this first drop down</text>
  <text start="291.62" dur="5.049">they&amp;#39;re going to have to blame someone</text>
  <text start="293.789" dur="4.771">and I believe that will be Trump he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="296.669" dur="2.37">the perfect scapegoat they will blame</text>
  <text start="298.56" dur="3.44">him</text>
  <text start="299.039" dur="5.85">they will then pump it back up by</text>
  <text start="302" dur="5.5">creating money currency I shouldn&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="304.889" dur="5.251">money currency out of thin air telling</text>
  <text start="307.5" dur="4.68">everyone that they saved the day but</text>
  <text start="310.14" dur="3.3">they know this is temporary because the</text>
  <text start="312.18" dur="2.78">rest of the world is going to look at</text>
  <text start="313.44" dur="4.22">this and say oK we&amp;#39;ve been to the</text>
  <text start="314.96" dur="4.14">before it hasn&amp;#39;t created jobs we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="317.66" dur="3.75">putting countries more into more and</text>
  <text start="319.1" dur="5.129">more debt this is not going to work and</text>
  <text start="321.41" dur="5.189">they need the second wave to be</text>
  <text start="324.229" dur="4.921">something completely different so when</text>
  <text start="326.599" dur="5.07">we see what is coming the first ways</text>
  <text start="329.15" dur="4.44">here will be blamed on Trump and</text>
  <text start="331.669" dur="3.601">whatever economic policies that he puts</text>
  <text start="333.59" dur="3.78">forth that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re waiting for</text>
  <text start="335.27" dur="4.619">they just can&amp;#39;t do it today or tomorrow</text>
  <text start="337.37" dur="4.62">they need to wait a couple of months to</text>
  <text start="339.889" dur="4.801">make sure that they have enough</text>
  <text start="341.99" dur="5.94">information to shape the narrative to</text>
  <text start="344.69" dur="5.46">blame Trump then once they pump it up</text>
  <text start="347.93" dur="4.47">they can say that the economy is still</text>
  <text start="350.15" dur="5.43">weak because of what Trump did the</text>
  <text start="352.4" dur="6">financial institutions are weak and the</text>
  <text start="355.58" dur="4.98">next wave most likely will be some type</text>
  <text start="358.4" dur="4.769">of an attack a cyber attack like we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="360.56" dur="5.82">talked about before nothing has changed</text>
  <text start="363.169" dur="4.291">here I&amp;#39;m a lot of people think that</text>
  <text start="366.38" dur="2.969">things have changed</text>
  <text start="367.46" dur="3.87">they think that Oh since Trump came into</text>
  <text start="369.349" dur="3.241">office everything was going to be fixed</text>
  <text start="371.33" dur="3.57">everything was going to get better and</text>
  <text start="372.59" dur="5.009">everything was going to be okay no the</text>
  <text start="374.9" dur="5.34">crash is still going to happen now if</text>
  <text start="377.599" dur="4.41">Trump brings it down before the central</text>
  <text start="380.24" dur="3.269">bank it makes no difference at this</text>
  <text start="382.009" dur="3.63">point because the economy is still</text>
  <text start="383.509" dur="4.321">coming down so no matter which way you</text>
  <text start="385.639" dur="4.56">look at it we&amp;#39;re still headed to the</text>
  <text start="387.83" dur="4.8">same exact point in time where the</text>
  <text start="390.199" dur="4.71">economy comes down now if Trump brings</text>
  <text start="392.63" dur="3.839">it down most likely he&amp;#39;s going to try to</text>
  <text start="394.909" dur="3.841">maneuver this and blame this on the</text>
  <text start="396.469" dur="3.781">central bank it&amp;#39;s a central bank and the</text>
  <text start="398.75" dur="3.27">deep state bring it down they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="400.25" dur="3.389">to be bringing us to war because they</text>
  <text start="402.02" dur="3.42">don&amp;#39;t want to be blamed for this so we</text>
  <text start="403.639" dur="5.791">can see there is a battle going on right</text>
  <text start="405.44" dur="8.159">now now other countries they realize</text>
  <text start="409.43" dur="6.769">that this entire dollar centric system</text>
  <text start="413.599" dur="6.12">well it can&amp;#39;t be sustained they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="416.199" dur="6.071">depend on the Western banking system</text>
  <text start="419.719" dur="6.991">this is why and we reported on this many</text>
  <text start="422.27" dur="7.769">many times before the Russian China BRIC</text>
  <text start="426.71" dur="6.72">system they&amp;#39;ve been working on a plan to</text>
  <text start="430.039" dur="6.93">sever ties with the international</text>
  <text start="433.43" dur="4.919">banking system and right now Russia we</text>
  <text start="436.969" dur="2.88">knew they were this was in development</text>
  <text start="438.349" dur="3.841">they knew they we knew they were doing</text>
  <text start="439.849" dur="5.161">this we knew that Russia and China and</text>
  <text start="442.19" dur="4.979">many of the ins were dealing outside of</text>
  <text start="445.01" dur="3.37">the dollar well right now Russia has</text>
  <text start="447.169" dur="3.971">successfully de</text>
  <text start="448.38" dur="4.98">helped and implemented an alternative</text>
  <text start="451.14" dur="4.62">should it be excluded from the</text>
  <text start="453.36" dur="5.31">international banking system and this is</text>
  <text start="455.76" dur="6.51">according to a recent report as far as</text>
  <text start="458.67" dur="5.76">Western sanctions go by for Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="462.27" dur="4.92">largest vulnerability is in its banking</text>
  <text start="464.43" dur="4.92">sector which for better or worse is tied</text>
  <text start="467.19" dur="4.59">to the hip with international banking if</text>
  <text start="469.35" dur="4.74">Russia wishes to maintain the status quo</text>
  <text start="471.78" dur="4.59">there&amp;#39;s not much that can be done about</text>
  <text start="474.09" dur="4.08">this dependency but surely after</text>
  <text start="476.37" dur="3.99">sanctions were announced in 2014</text>
  <text start="478.17" dur="4.23">Moscow set out to prepare for the</text>
  <text start="480.36" dur="3.81">worst-case scenario being cut off from</text>
  <text start="482.4" dur="3.45">the worldwide international financial</text>
  <text start="484.17" dur="3.66">telecommunication system which is the</text>
  <text start="485.85" dur="2.49">swift system and what is the Swiss</text>
  <text start="487.83" dur="3.11">system</text>
  <text start="488.34" dur="5.79">well the Swift system allows for fast</text>
  <text start="490.94" dur="5.35">secure allegedly secure international</text>
  <text start="494.13" dur="4.83">financial transfers and what Russia</text>
  <text start="496.29" dur="3.99">realized and what China has realized and</text>
  <text start="498.96" dur="3.96">this is why they&amp;#39;ve been duplicating</text>
  <text start="500.28" dur="6.03">everything that is here in the West out</text>
  <text start="502.92" dur="5.34">to the east they realized that if we got</text>
  <text start="506.31" dur="3.78">into a like a war if something should</text>
  <text start="508.26" dur="3.96">happen like sanctions or they&amp;#39;re cut off</text>
  <text start="510.09" dur="5.1">and banking system they needed a way to</text>
  <text start="512.22" dur="6.12">survive and this is why they set out on</text>
  <text start="515.19" dur="6.33">the task of creating a separate system</text>
  <text start="518.34" dur="6.63">now I do believe that they&amp;#39;re creating</text>
  <text start="521.52" dur="6.9">the system also to become maybe the next</text>
  <text start="524.97" dur="5.13">reserve status or handle a lot of what</text>
  <text start="528.42" dur="4.05">the West is doing right now when the</text>
  <text start="530.1" dur="4.56">system comes apart and falls apart but</text>
  <text start="532.47" dur="5.31">Washington in Europe they realize that</text>
  <text start="534.66" dur="5.28">if they actually cut Russia off from the</text>
  <text start="537.78" dur="4.89">Swift system it would be a complete</text>
  <text start="539.94" dur="5.76">disaster and we can see that European</text>
  <text start="542.67" dur="5.46">Central Bank policymaker a walled knot</text>
  <text start="545.7" dur="4.17">when he warned against kicking Russia</text>
  <text start="548.13" dur="5">banks out of the Swift payment transfer</text>
  <text start="549.87" dur="6.33">system as part of tighter sanctions on</text>
  <text start="553.13" dur="5.32">Moscow but this doesn&amp;#39;t stop Europe and</text>
  <text start="556.2" dur="5.76">Washington from threatening to pull the</text>
  <text start="558.45" dur="7.05">Swift plug so we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="561.96" dur="6.84">Russia is prepared and they are ready to</text>
  <text start="565.5" dur="6.81">deal outside of the Swift system and</text>
  <text start="568.8" dur="5.85">China has created many different markets</text>
  <text start="572.31" dur="6.54">and they&amp;#39;ve created their own payment</text>
  <text start="574.65" dur="6.9">system to deal outside of the Western</text>
  <text start="578.85" dur="6">banking system because they knew</text>
  <text start="581.55" dur="5.49">one day they were going to need this now</text>
  <text start="584.85" dur="4.739">they don&amp;#39;t spend all this time and all</text>
  <text start="587.04" dur="5.28">these funds to create a separate system</text>
  <text start="589.589" dur="4.321">if they if they think that this will</text>
  <text start="592.32" dur="3.75">never happen they do it on purpose</text>
  <text start="593.91" dur="4.919">because they realize what is happening</text>
  <text start="596.07" dur="4.709">with the dollar think about this out in</text>
  <text start="598.829" dur="3.621">the Middle East where they thought they</text>
  <text start="600.779" dur="4.62">were going to have complete control of</text>
  <text start="602.45" dur="4.99">all the Middle Eastern countries even</text>
  <text start="605.399" dur="3.661">including Iran where they would have</text>
  <text start="607.44" dur="5.91">control of the oil system the only</text>
  <text start="609.06" dur="8.19">reason we are out there is because they</text>
  <text start="613.35" dur="6.9">have oil and they want the oil to be</text>
  <text start="617.25" dur="5.37">sold using the dollar if the oil dried</text>
  <text start="620.25" dur="4.47">up in the Middle East they would have no</text>
  <text start="622.62" dur="3.899">use for all of these countries what</text>
  <text start="624.72" dur="5.609">would they have there that they would</text>
  <text start="626.519" dur="7.921">need nothing the entire system is based</text>
  <text start="630.329" dur="7.981">on oil that&amp;#39;s why the United States</text>
  <text start="634.44" dur="7.5">central bankers the deep state wanted</text>
  <text start="638.31" dur="6.48">the entire area so they can control the</text>
  <text start="641.94" dur="5.91">flow of oil and make sure that every</text>
  <text start="644.79" dur="5.85">country was purchasing it using at the</text>
  <text start="647.85" dur="4.229">dollar now there&amp;#39;s problems because we</text>
  <text start="650.64" dur="4.439">can see that things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="652.079" dur="5.76">disintegrating out in this area and they</text>
  <text start="655.079" dur="5.191">know it they realize it that they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="657.839" dur="5.281">reach their goal they didn&amp;#39;t reach their</text>
  <text start="660.27" dur="6.03">goal of having everything which tells us</text>
  <text start="663.12" dur="5.64">right now that things are going to</text>
