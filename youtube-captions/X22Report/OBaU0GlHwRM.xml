  <text start="93.299" dur="5.371">where this actually goes from this point</text>
  <text start="96.509" dur="4.411">because as we can see it does look like</text>
  <text start="98.67" dur="4.26">Greece is trying to pivot away from the</text>
  <text start="100.92" dur="5.46">eurozone and this is not the only</text>
  <text start="102.93" dur="5.13">country in Europe that is looking at the</text>

  <text start="396.89" dur="3.519">indicator shows there&amp;#39;s no bubble</text>
  <text start="399.53" dur="5.52">forming bulb we</text>
  <text start="400.409" dur="7.201">her this before from the central bank</text>

  <text start="440.129" dur="3.81">propaganda for the housing market it was</text>
  <text start="442.229" dur="4.98">clear that Bloomberg did not research</text>

  <text start="464.36" dur="4.839">although nationwide offers no detail</text>
  <text start="467.519" dur="4.26">regarding the sources for the data it</text>

  <text start="512.689" dur="6.4">the housing bubble burst in 2005-2006</text>
  <text start="516.269" dur="5.221">that bubble was never allowed to fully</text>
  <text start="519.089" dur="5.641">deflate what occurred since the Fed</text>
  <text start="521.49" dur="5.55">began pumping in 3.6 trillion of printed</text>
  <text start="524.73" dur="6.659">money into the banking system is a dead</text>
  <text start="527.04" dur="6.96">cat bounce in the housing market this is</text>
  <text start="531.389" dur="4.591">all due to the series of a dead cat</text>
  <text start="534" dur="4.65">in sales volume which occurred primarily</text>
  <text start="535.98" dur="4.85">from fed and government intervention</text>
  <text start="538.65" dur="5.4">policies for instance the spike in</text>
  <text start="540.83" dur="5.71">2009-2010 was triggered when the</text>
  <text start="544.05" dur="5.64">government implemented a first time</text>
  <text start="546.54" dur="4.59">homebuyer tax credit effective between</text>
  <text start="549.69" dur="4.5">two thousand eight and two thousand ten</text>
  <text start="551.13" dur="5.16">the balance that occurred after 2010 was</text>
  <text start="554.19" dur="4.32">primarily feud by big investment funds</text>
  <text start="556.29" dur="4.2">buying hundreds of thousands of</text>
  <text start="558.51" dur="4.32">foreclosed and distressed homes the</text>
  <text start="560.49" dur="5.76">government offers 0% financing to any</text>
  <text start="562.83" dur="7.31">big fund home owned right now home</text>
  <text start="566.25" dur="7.44">ownership rate in the United States</text>
  <text start="570.14" dur="7.63">basically has plunged we are back to</text>
  <text start="573.69" dur="7.35">nineteen ninety four levels so when we</text>
  <text start="577.77" dur="6.45">look at all this in reality the housing</text>
  <text start="581.04" dur="6.54">market is deteriorating it&amp;#39;s not getting</text>
  <text start="584.22" dur="6.78">better home prices right now have driven</text>
  <text start="587.58" dur="6.06">higher since 2010 but by a combination</text>
  <text start="591" dur="4.2">of the Fed artificially driving interest</text>
  <text start="593.64" dur="5.19">rates to a record low levels and the</text>
  <text start="595.2" dur="5.25">direct injection of 1.7 trillion into</text>
  <text start="598.83" dur="4.62">the housing market via the feds mortgage</text>
  <text start="600.45" dur="5.85">QE policy in its attempt to stimulate</text>
  <text start="603.45" dur="6.15">the housing market well guess what they</text>
  <text start="606.3" dur="5.85">stimulated housing prices they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="609.6" dur="6.12">stimulate people going out and</text>
  <text start="612.15" dur="5.85">purchasing homes home builders have</text>
  <text start="615.72" dur="4.35">built up a record level of inventory on</text>
  <text start="618" dur="3.96">their balance sheets moreover the</text>
  <text start="620.07" dur="5.31">artificially induced rising home prices</text>
  <text start="621.96" dur="6.78">is a massive wealth transfer mechanism</text>
  <text start="625.38" dur="5.43">from home buyers to home sellers ninety</text>
  <text start="628.74" dur="3.57">percent of all home buyers and</text>
  <text start="630.81" dur="4.38">ninety-three percent of all new</text>
  <text start="632.31" dur="7.68">construction home buyers use a mortgage</text>
  <text start="635.19" dur="9.06">the question is if the real estate</text>
  <text start="639.99" dur="7.23">industry is improving people would go</text>
  <text start="644.25" dur="5.64">out and use mortgages to buy them</text>
  <text start="647.22" dur="5.13">correct yes that is correct because I</text>
  <text start="649.89" dur="4.11">can&amp;#39;t believe that everyone has four</text>
  <text start="652.35" dur="4.92">five six hundred thousand dollars in</text>
  <text start="654" dur="4.74">cash just laying around and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="657.27" dur="4.08">going to go ahead and use it to purchase</text>
  <text start="658.74" dur="4.68">a house so basically the mortgage</text>
  <text start="661.35" dur="5.62">bankers association reports mortgage</text>
  <text start="663.42" dur="4.899">applications on a weekly basis</text>
  <text start="666.97" dur="3.119">and according to their most recent</text>
  <text start="668.319" dur="3.991">weekly report mortgage purchases</text>
  <text start="670.089" dur="7.23">applications are thirty one percent</text>
  <text start="672.31" dur="7.709">lower than in 2001 in the context of</text>
  <text start="677.319" dur="5.31">nearly 14 years of population growth and</text>
  <text start="680.019" dur="5.61">near record-low mortgage rates this</text>
  <text start="682.629" dur="4.621">metric represents a housing market which</text>
  <text start="685.629" dur="4.471">sales volume has significantly</text>
  <text start="687.25" dur="7.379">deteriorated in comparison to the market</text>
  <text start="690.1" dur="8.4">in 2001 so basically the housing market</text>
  <text start="694.629" dur="6">is not in recovery people are not taking</text>
  <text start="698.5" dur="4.5">out the mortgages people are not going</text>
  <text start="700.629" dur="4.77">out and purchasing the homes all the</text>
  <text start="703" dur="6.029">government did the central bankers all</text>
  <text start="705.399" dur="6.391">they did was inflate prices by telling</text>
  <text start="709.029" dur="5.011">the banks listen keep those houses off</text>
  <text start="711.79" dur="5.01">the market hedge funds investment</text>
  <text start="714.04" dur="6.239">companies pump up the market purchase</text>
  <text start="716.8" dur="6.42">those homes don&amp;#39;t sell them but the rest</text>
  <text start="720.279" dur="6.12">of America is sitting on the sidelines</text>
  <text start="723.22" dur="5.039">they don&amp;#39;t have the funds to go in and</text>
  <text start="726.399" dur="5.341">purchase these homes and this is why</text>
  <text start="728.259" dur="6.18">back in August of 2013 going forward</text>
