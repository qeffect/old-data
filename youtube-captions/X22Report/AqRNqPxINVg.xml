  <text start="43.12" dur="6.66">the spark to kick off World War 3 let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="46.72" dur="5.82">get into the economic collapse political</text>
  <text start="49.78" dur="6">and geopolitical news now over the past</text>
  <text start="52.54" dur="5.55">week we know that the government</text>
  <text start="55.78" dur="5.13">officials were out in Paris talking</text>
  <text start="58.09" dur="4.739">about global warming trying to tax the</text>
  <text start="60.91" dur="4.11">people and basically they spent millions</text>
  <text start="62.829" dur="5.391">of dollars spread a lot of pollution</text>
  <text start="65.02" dur="7.62">flying in their private jets over to</text>
  <text start="68.22" dur="6.429">Paris but out of all of this they keep</text>
  <text start="72.64" dur="3.119">hitting us with things like ninety seven</text>
  <text start="74.649" dur="3.33">percent of the world&amp;#39;s scientists</text>
  <text start="75.759" dur="6.091">supposedly believe in catastrophic</text>
  <text start="77.979" dur="5.701">global warming and you know they this</text>
  <text start="81.85" dur="4.53">whole thing requires massive government</text>
  <text start="83.68" dur="5.54">invent intervention and out of the</text>
  <text start="86.38" dur="6.96">natural news he breaks down basically</text>
  <text start="89.22" dur="8.02">where this 97% consensus of scientists</text>
  <text start="93.34" dur="6.959">came from and the percentage derives</text>
  <text start="97.24" dur="7.29">from a survey conducted for a thesis by</text>
  <text start="100.299" dur="6.93">mr k zimmerman the survey was a to</text>
  <text start="104.53" dur="5.1">question online questionnaire sent to</text>
  <text start="107.229" dur="4.591">about ten thousand two hundred or so or</text>
  <text start="109.63" dur="7.19">scientists of whom three thousand</text>
  <text start="111.82" dur="9.089">responded of the responding scientists</text>
  <text start="116.82" dur="6.58">96.2 percent came from North America</text>
  <text start="120.909" dur="5.221">only six point two percent came from</text>
  <text start="123.4" dur="4.56">Canada so the United States is over</text>
  <text start="126.13" dur="6.75">representative even within the North</text>
  <text start="127.96" dur="6.57">American sample nine percent of us</text>
  <text start="132.88" dur="4.5">respondents are from California so</text>
  <text start="134.53" dur="5.519">California is over representative within</text>
  <text start="137.38" dur="5.13">within not just the US sample it has</text>
  <text start="140.049" dur="4.711">over twice as large a share as the</text>
  <text start="142.51" dur="6.21">sample as Europe Asia Australia Pacific</text>
  <text start="144.76" dur="8.88">Latin America Africa combined of the ten</text>
  <text start="148.72" dur="7.769">percent of non-us respondents Canada has</text>
  <text start="153.64" dur="5.25">sixty-two percent not content with such</text>
  <text start="156.489" dur="6.151">a distorted sample the researchers then</text>
  <text start="158.89" dur="4.69">selected 79 of their sample and declared</text>
  <text start="162.64" dur="6.91">them</text>
  <text start="163.58" dur="7.44">experts of those 79 two were excluded</text>
  <text start="169.55" dur="5.34">from a second supplementary</text>
  <text start="171.02" dur="5.97">questionnaire so they have 75 out of 77</text>
  <text start="174.89" dur="4.11">made it through the final round and</text>
  <text start="176.99" dur="4.98">ninety seven point four percent were</text>
  <text start="179" dur="7.23">found to agree with the consensus that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="181.97" dur="6.36">where the 97% comes from so a couple of</text>
  <text start="186.23" dur="5.82">dozen California scientists can</text>
  <text start="188.33" dur="6.54">determine the consensus of the world out</text>
  <text start="192.05" dur="6.72">of all the hundreds of thousands of</text>
  <text start="194.87" dur="6.57">scientists in the world only 75 of them</text>
  <text start="198.77" dur="7.11">were selected to count for the climate</text>
  <text start="201.44" dur="7.86">change survey well as we can see this</text>
  <text start="205.88" dur="6.42">whole thing is completely fake phony and</text>
  <text start="209.3" dur="6.18">false just like everything else the</text>
  <text start="212.3" dur="7.11">government talks about basically lies</text>
  <text start="215.48" dur="8.31">about this is just another lie in their</text>
  <text start="219.41" dur="7.74">cap and they continually lie to the</text>
  <text start="223.79" dur="8.97">people we know that San Bernardino was a</text>
  <text start="227.15" dur="8.1">complete false flag the witnesses</text>
  <text start="232.76" dur="7.56">continually say there were three white</text>
  <text start="235.25" dur="9.33">men in military fatigues carrying</text>
  <text start="240.32" dur="6.83">military styled weapons and we can see</text>
  <text start="244.58" dur="6.24">whatever agenda they had gun control</text>
  <text start="247.15" dur="5.26">terrorism it all got confused and this</text>
  <text start="250.82" dur="3.48">is why they&amp;#39;re continually pushing the</text>
  <text start="252.41" dur="3.93">story right now but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="254.3" dur="7.1">interesting about this is that the FBI</text>
  <text start="256.34" dur="7.14">is still out there and still pushing</text>
  <text start="261.4" dur="4.42">encryption and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="263.48" dur="5.85">encryption played a role in San</text>
  <text start="265.82" dur="7.11">Bernardino attacks and there are two</text>
  <text start="269.33" dur="6.36">stories that came out one which says the</text>
  <text start="272.93" dur="5.79">Fed challenged by encrypted devices on</text>
  <text start="275.69" dur="5.91">San Bernardino attackers and another one</text>
  <text start="278.72" dur="5.97">lawmakers no evidence San Bernardino</text>
  <text start="281.6" dur="4.74">shooters used encryption now the first</text>
  <text start="284.69" dur="4.22">story the one claiming that San</text>
  <text start="286.34" dur="5.61">Bernardino attackers had encryption</text>
  <text start="288.91" dur="6.67">actually came out before the second</text>
  <text start="291.95" dur="4.89">story saying they did not it appears the</text>
  <text start="295.58" dur="4.89">same an</text>
  <text start="296.84" dur="6.42">anonymous senior US official who were</text>
  <text start="300.47" dur="6.54">whispering in ABC&amp;#39;s ear we&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="303.26" dur="5.969">same to CBS because all of a sudden they</text>
  <text start="307.01" dur="5.61">posted a ridiculously vague tweet</text>
  <text start="309.229" dur="6.75">without any follow-up story any research</text>
  <text start="312.62" dur="5.6">or anything else and what they wrote and</text>
  <text start="315.979" dur="5.011">what they tweeted I should say new</text>
  <text start="318.22" dur="5.35">investigators find levels of built-in</text>
  <text start="320.99" dur="6.63">encryption and San Bernardino shooters</text>
  <text start="323.57" dur="7.5">phones and this came from senior law</text>
  <text start="327.62" dur="5.94">enforcement officials tells CBS News so</text>
  <text start="331.07" dur="5.099">let me read that again new investigators</text>
  <text start="333.56" dur="6.45">find levels of built-in encryption in</text>
  <text start="336.169" dur="6.75">San Bernardino shooters phones well when</text>
  <text start="340.01" dur="5.67">you first hear it you say yeah whoa hey</text>
  <text start="342.919" dur="4.261">and then this spread across to all the</text>
  <text start="345.68" dur="3.959">news agencies and they just ran with it</text>
  <text start="347.18" dur="6.12">without any type of research or anything</text>
  <text start="349.639" dur="7.981">like that but when you look into this</text>
  <text start="353.3" dur="6.81">and look at the phrase built in well</text>
  <text start="357.62" dur="6.09">that&amp;#39;s very vague because all of our</text>
  <text start="360.11" dur="7.429">phones have built-in encryption think</text>
  <text start="363.71" dur="7.32">about it for a second every phone and</text>
  <text start="367.539" dur="8.111">computing device currently sold in the</text>
  <text start="371.03" dur="6.9">US has levels of built-in encryption if</text>
  <text start="375.65" dur="4.11">they didn&amp;#39;t criminals would be able to</text>
  <text start="377.93" dur="4.83">easily intercept your calls and</text>
  <text start="379.76" dur="5.82">everything else so it&amp;#39;s every phone is</text>
  <text start="382.76" dur="6.96">built in this story is completely fake</text>
  <text start="385.58" dur="7.83">it&amp;#39;s phony it&amp;#39;s misleading but they do</text>
  <text start="389.72" dur="5.759">this to convince you that these people</text>
  <text start="393.41" dur="4.41">are using encryption because what they</text>
  <text start="395.479" dur="6.991">really want is you to give up your</text>
  <text start="397.82" dur="7.59">rights and allow them into your email to</text>
  <text start="402.47" dur="5.28">your tweets to your phone calls to your</text>
  <text start="405.41" dur="6.39">Facebook page you name it they want</text>
  <text start="407.75" dur="5.789">access and every single person needs to</text>
  <text start="411.8" dur="4.92">say you know something I&amp;#39;m supporting my</text>
  <text start="413.539" dur="5.491">rights you don&amp;#39;t have the right to spy</text>
  <text start="416.72" dur="3.84">on me so guess what i&amp;#39;m not using google</text>
  <text start="419.03" dur="4.859">for my searches i&amp;#39;m going to be using</text>
  <text start="420.56" dur="5.159">start page and i&amp;#39;m going to use the</text>
  <text start="423.889" dur="4.201">proxies there so you can&amp;#39;t track my</text>
  <text start="425.719" dur="4.441">location i&amp;#39;m going to use an email</text>
  <text start="428.09" dur="4.53">encryption service</text>
  <text start="430.16" dur="6.33">you can&amp;#39;t get my email I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="432.62" dur="5.88">protect my phone my iPad my credit cards</text>
  <text start="436.49" dur="5.19">with the RFID chip in them I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="438.5" dur="5.31">protect my real ID which is my license</text>
  <text start="441.68" dur="4.65">which everyone will assume most likely</text>
  <text start="443.81" dur="5.22">get because DHS is pushing this all</text>
  <text start="446.33" dur="5.88">across the country where they will have</text>
  <text start="449.03" dur="5.73">RFID chips in i will use some type of</text>
  <text start="452.21" dur="5.43">device to pluck this signal you can use</text>
  <text start="454.76" dur="5.19">block it pocket calm these are sleeves</text>
  <text start="457.64" dur="3.78">where you can slide your credit cards</text>
  <text start="459.95" dur="3.51">your license into them you can slide</text>
  <text start="461.42" dur="4.56">your phone into them there in 20 van</text>
  <text start="463.46" dur="6.06">with silver copper it blocks the signal</text>
  <text start="465.98" dur="5.1">so nobody can track you on my site if</text>
  <text start="469.52" dur="3.84">you scroll down a little bit on the</text>
  <text start="471.08" dur="5.52">right hand side there&amp;#39;s open source code</text>
  <text start="473.36" dur="7.65">for pi encryption you can use this to</text>
  <text start="476.6" dur="8.31">encrypt messages but we have to</text>
  <text start="481.01" dur="6.12">reinforce our rights because what the</text>
  <text start="484.91" dur="5.31">government is doing right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="487.13" dur="5.46">trying to have the corporations now spy</text>
  <text start="490.22" dur="5.28">on the American people and transfer that</text>
  <text start="492.59" dur="7.29">information over to the government using</text>
  <text start="495.5" dur="6.75">cissa they will not they will not hold</text>
  <text start="499.88" dur="3.9">the corporation&amp;#39;s liable for the</text>
  <text start="502.25" dur="3.69">information they pass to the government</text>
  <text start="503.78" dur="6.36">and how are they trying to get this</text>
  <text start="505.94" dur="6.06">passed well it looks like sources that</text>
  <text start="510.14" dur="5.37">are close to the legislative</text>
  <text start="512" dur="8.419">negotiations they have indicated there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="515.51" dur="9.12">a final version of the sissa bill and</text>
  <text start="520.419" dur="8.141">it&amp;#39;s been gutted um of all the privacy</text>
  <text start="524.63" dur="7.59">protections and it has been added to the</text>
  <text start="528.56" dur="5.85">Omnibus the must-pass budget bill that</text>
  <text start="532.22" dur="5.7">congress is expected to take up this</text>

  <text start="537.92" dur="7.11">in the budget bill now Obama has said</text>
  <text start="541.49" dur="6.95">many many times that he would veto this</text>
  <text start="545.03" dur="6.3">type of bill if it came across his desk</text>
  <text start="548.44" dur="5.26">let&amp;#39;s see if he&amp;#39;s telling the truth or</text>
  <text start="551.33" dur="6.63">he&amp;#39;s lying because if it does pass his</text>
  <text start="553.7" dur="6.03">desk he should be to it correct just</text>
  <text start="557.96" dur="4.5">like he was going to reform the NSA</text>

  <text start="562.46" dur="3.719">happens</text>
  <text start="563.329" dur="5.25">when this bill passes his desk or does</text>
  <text start="566.179" dur="5.28">he sign it at the middle in the middle</text>

  <text start="821.75" dur="4.29">in the country have not gone to school</text>
  <text start="823.189" dur="6.9">since the conflict began the air strikes</text>

  <text start="856.639" dur="5.851">these are fighting the people are</text>
  <text start="858.74" dur="7.349">getting angry and right now they have</text>
  <text start="862.49" dur="7.17">proposed a ceasefire to bring in</text>
  <text start="866.089" dur="6.481">humanitarian aid and to assist those</text>
  <text start="869.66" dur="5.76">that are suffering and we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="872.57" dur="4.079">before and as soon as it was over they</text>
  <text start="875.42" dur="3.3">started the bombing again actually</text>
  <text start="876.649" dur="3.06">during the ceasefire they were bombing</text>
  <text start="878.72" dur="3.239">actually they weren&amp;#39;t letting in</text>
  <text start="879.709" dur="4.32">humanitarian aid in through some of the</text>
  <text start="881.959" dur="4.44">ports so we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this</text>
  <text start="884.029" dur="4.881">works out we&amp;#39;ll have to see if the</text>
  <text start="886.399" dur="7.471">people actually get humanitarian aid</text>
  <text start="888.91" dur="7.96">because we know time is running out now</text>
  <text start="893.87" dur="5.25">Russia is saying that you the u.s.</text>
  <text start="896.87" dur="4.76">failed to prevent turkey from downing a</text>
  <text start="899.12" dur="5.88">Russian jet because they signed an</text>
  <text start="901.63" dur="6.76">agreement the two countries the US and</text>
  <text start="905" dur="5.25">Russia it was a memorandum on ensuring</text>
  <text start="908.39" dur="4.53">the safety of military aviation flights</text>
  <text start="910.25" dur="4.74">in Syria and this went to the coalition</text>
  <text start="912.92" dur="5.55">forces and turkey is part of the</text>
  <text start="914.99" dur="6.75">coalition forces and the u.s. did</text>
  <text start="918.47" dur="6.69">absolutely nothing to prevent this from</text>
  <text start="921.74" dur="4.98">occurring which is true because they</text>
  <text start="925.16" dur="3.359">wanted it to happen because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="926.72" dur="3.359">trying to spark World War three and</text>
  <text start="928.519" dur="6.121">they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="930.079" dur="9.57">to do this now we know that turkey has</text>
  <text start="934.64" dur="8.09">been caught smuggling oil through Iraq</text>
  <text start="939.649" dur="5.911">and Syria up into Turkey we know that</text>
  <text start="942.73" dur="4.87">erdo wan&amp;#39;s son and I&amp;#39;ve been pronouncing</text>
  <text start="945.56" dur="4.709">his name wrong its not ur de gan it&amp;#39;s er</text>
  <text start="947.6" dur="5.25">de juan and I thank you to one of the</text>
  <text start="950.269" dur="5.25">listeners that help me with this the G</text>
  <text start="952.85" dur="5.429">is silent and i will now pronounce his</text>
  <text start="955.519" dur="6.481">name correctly and basically his son</text>
  <text start="958.279" dur="5.881">below was orchestrating all of this and</text>
  <text start="962" dur="4.44">right now us and</text>
  <text start="964.16" dur="6.02">turkey have been caught covering up the</text>
  <text start="966.44" dur="6.66">ISIS oil trade and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="970.18" dur="6.519">that they&amp;#39;re in violation of UN</text>
  <text start="973.1" dur="5.64">resolution 2199 which states bandung</text>
  <text start="976.699" dur="6.031">financing of the terrorist organization</text>
  <text start="978.74" dur="7.38">and basically what this means is the you</text>
  <text start="982.73" dur="5.609">the resolution 2199 adopted on our</text>
  <text start="986.12" dur="4.55">initiative in February countries are</text>
  <text start="988.339" dur="4.831">obliged to provide information about</text>
  <text start="990.67" dur="4.209">financing terrorists to the Security</text>
  <text start="993.17" dur="4.05">Council if they have such information</text>
  <text start="994.879" dur="4.471">that means the Americans had to provide</text>
  <text start="997.22" dur="4.229">such information and of course turkey</text>
  <text start="999.35" dur="4.849">which should have been reported as</text>
  <text start="1001.449" dur="6">illegal oil trade but they didn&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="1004.199" dur="8.2">why because they&amp;#39;re in charge of all of</text>
  <text start="1007.449" dur="8.01">this that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;ve been using this</text>
  <text start="1012.399" dur="6.841">oil to fund the operation of the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1015.459" dur="9.021">state and now we&amp;#39;ve learned that turkey</text>
  <text start="1019.24" dur="9.48">is the main provider of the sarin gas in</text>
  <text start="1024.48" dur="8.55">Syria they are complicit in the</text>
  <text start="1028.72" dur="9">smuggling of banned chemical weapons and</text>
  <text start="1033.03" dur="6.49">of course Assad was blamed for this so</text>
  <text start="1037.72" dur="4.619">coming out of the Turkish Republican</text>
  <text start="1039.52" dur="8.549">People&amp;#39;s Party CHP the opposition member</text>
  <text start="1042.339" dur="7.71">aaron air deem accused ankara of</text>
  <text start="1048.069" dur="3.36">covering up a major war crime likely</text>
  <text start="1050.049" dur="3.691">direct directed at high-level</text>
  <text start="1051.429" dur="5.161">involvement in smuggling materials used</text>
  <text start="1053.74" dur="5.669">to make deadly sarin gas to the islamic</text>
  <text start="1056.59" dur="5.01">state and other terrorists Syria&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1059.409" dur="5.341">government had nothing to do with the</text>
  <text start="1061.6" dur="5.449">sarin gas episode but it was blamed on</text>
  <text start="1064.75" dur="4.559">them so they can try to bring in</text>
  <text start="1067.049" dur="5.951">military assets and equipment and</text>
  <text start="1069.309" dur="7.891">basically have an air force to be used</text>

  <text start="1077.2" dur="4.02">bomb certain areas to bring them closer</text>
  <text start="1079.659" dur="4.411">to removing Assad but that didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="1081.22" dur="4.41">out in 2013 the US government central</text>
  <text start="1084.07" dur="2.969">bankers couldn&amp;#39;t get any traction from</text>
  <text start="1085.63" dur="5.61">the people the people didn&amp;#39;t want to go</text>
  <text start="1087.039" dur="6.211">into Syria whatsoever and basically they</text>
  <text start="1091.24" dur="4.26">had to go with Putin who said listen if</text>
  <text start="1093.25" dur="3.63">we get rid of the chemical weapons will</text>

  <text start="1096.88" dur="2.79">okay let&amp;#39;s do this</text>
  <text start="1098.02" dur="4.29">but their goal was always the same and</text>
  <text start="1099.67" dur="6.36">that was to remove a son and right now</text>
  <text start="1102.31" dur="7.05">we&amp;#39;re seeing that there&amp;#39;s a there is</text>
  <text start="1106.03" dur="6.57">data in this new indictment against</text>
  <text start="1109.36" dur="5.13">Ankara where chemical weapon materials</text>
