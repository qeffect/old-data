  <text start="100.15" dur="4.95">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="103" dur="4.35">the corporate media the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="105.1" dur="6.3">they are out there and they are</text>
  <text start="107.35" dur="8.25">explaining why spending is going to drop</text>
  <text start="111.4" dur="6.81">in February and maybe into March because</text>
  <text start="115.6" dur="6.269">what they&amp;#39;re saying is that the federal</text>
  <text start="118.21" dur="5.939">tax refunds well they have tumbled by</text>
  <text start="121.869" dur="5.191">78% in the early part of February</text>
  <text start="124.149" dur="4.5">compared to 2016 and they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="127.06" dur="3.57">the result of this new law which</text>
  <text start="128.649" dur="4.801">requires the IRS to delay the printing</text>
  <text start="130.63" dur="5.61">of checks to households claiming</text>
  <text start="133.45" dur="6.78">specific tax credits and the reason for</text>
  <text start="136.24" dur="6.3">the slowdown is because of this 2015 law</text>
  <text start="140.23" dur="4.74">that Congress passed forcing the IRS to</text>
  <text start="142.54" dur="5.25">hold back refund checks related to the</text>
  <text start="144.97" dur="5.82">Earned Income Tax Credit and the child</text>
  <text start="147.79" dur="5.19">tax credit until at least February 15th</text>
  <text start="150.79" dur="5.01">and what they&amp;#39;re saying is because of</text>
  <text start="152.98" dur="4.8">this this is going to have an effect on</text>
  <text start="155.8" dur="5.01">people spending money in the stores</text>
  <text start="157.78" dur="4.71">people purchasing homes and things like</text>
  <text start="160.81" dur="4.23">that now of course they&amp;#39;re using this as</text>
  <text start="162.49" dur="4.079">an excuse because we saw from the prior</text>
  <text start="165.04" dur="3.27">years even when people were receiving</text>
  <text start="166.569" dur="3.781">their tax refunds guess what they</text>
  <text start="168.31" dur="4.29">weren&amp;#39;t going out and spending but</text>
  <text start="170.35" dur="5.66">they&amp;#39;re trying to use this as an excuse</text>
  <text start="172.6" dur="6.089">of why retail won&amp;#39;t be doing as well as</text>
  <text start="176.01" dur="4.66">everyone thought it was going to do now</text>
  <text start="178.689" dur="2.721">they usually blame this on the weather</text>
  <text start="180.67" dur="3.23">which they know</text>
  <text start="181.41" dur="4.56">likely probably will and remember even</text>
  <text start="183.9" dur="5.34">during the good weather days retail</text>
  <text start="185.97" dur="7.4">sales are dropping and we have to</text>
  <text start="189.24" dur="7.67">understand that the number of refunds</text>
  <text start="193.37" dur="7.66">they are less right now than they were</text>
  <text start="196.91" dur="7.48">last year because a lot less people are</text>
  <text start="201.03" dur="6.48">working or they have jobs that are</text>
  <text start="204.39" dur="5.28">paying less right now and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="207.51" dur="6.39">expecting a decline of about 40 to 50</text>
  <text start="209.67" dur="8.79">percent in February of people receiving</text>
  <text start="213.9" dur="7.26">refunds and that&amp;#39;s quite large because</text>
  <text start="218.46" dur="4.53">we have to remember the tax receipts the</text>
  <text start="221.16" dur="3.39">federal tax receipts coming to the</text>
  <text start="222.99" dur="3.68">government estate tax receipts coming to</text>
  <text start="224.55" dur="5.25">the government they have been declining</text>
  <text start="226.67" dur="5.11">every single year they&amp;#39;re bringing in</text>
  <text start="229.8" dur="4.34">less and less and when people are out of</text>
  <text start="231.78" dur="5.55">work when people have jobs that are</text>
  <text start="234.14" dur="6.55">where they&amp;#39;re making less money well</text>
  <text start="237.33" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re not sending in money to the</text>
  <text start="240.69" dur="4.62">government they&amp;#39;re also going to get a</text>
  <text start="242.4" dur="5.04">lot less back and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="245.31" dur="3.3">seeing right now now there was an</text>
  <text start="247.44" dur="3.99">interesting story coming out of</text>
  <text start="248.61" dur="4.08">Bloomberg which is not even interesting</text>
  <text start="251.43" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s ridiculous because they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="252.69" dur="4.919">that fake news drives the fake markets</text>
  <text start="256.14" dur="3.3">well we know the market is completely</text>
  <text start="257.609" dur="5.281">fake and we know that the corporate</text>
  <text start="259.44" dur="6.33">media puts out fake news and we know</text>
  <text start="262.89" dur="5.58">that the market really has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="265.77" dur="4.77">with corporate earnings anymore sales</text>
  <text start="268.47" dur="3.51">revenue or anything like that because</text>
  <text start="270.54" dur="4.23">they have the high-frequency traders the</text>
  <text start="271.98" dur="4.38">plunge Protection Team and we see that</text>
  <text start="274.77" dur="5.22">the free money from the Fed is coming</text>
  <text start="276.36" dur="5.34">into the market to pump this up and we</text>
  <text start="279.99" dur="4.89">see that a lot of the training is done</text>
  <text start="281.7" dur="5.55">by computers so we know that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="284.88" dur="3.66">completely fake but it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="287.25" dur="4.02">interesting that they come out with this</text>
  <text start="288.54" dur="4.47">story trying to explain you know why all</text>
  <text start="291.27" dur="4.29">this is happening why the markets moving</text>
  <text start="293.01" dur="5.13">up we can see that they&amp;#39;re creating a</text>
  <text start="295.56" dur="5.16">narrative right now trying to explain</text>
  <text start="298.14" dur="5.19">away why the markets going up while</text>
  <text start="300.72" dur="5.49">Trump is being president and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="303.33" dur="6.3">creating the narrative that as he puts</text>
  <text start="306.21" dur="6.15">forth his economic policies the entire</text>
  <text start="309.63" dur="5.07">economy most likely is not going to do</text>
  <text start="312.36" dur="3.04">well as we move further into this year</text>
  <text start="314.7" dur="2.499">because</text>
  <text start="315.4" dur="3.66">we know that mario draghi is out there</text>
  <text start="317.199" dur="4.411">saying this we understand that Fitch</text>
  <text start="319.06" dur="4.859">came out and said this and we see right</text>
  <text start="321.61" dur="6.149">now that they&amp;#39;re continually doing this</text>
  <text start="323.919" dur="6.391">trying to create this picture now what</text>
  <text start="327.759" dur="5.041">we&amp;#39;re seeing here is they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="330.31" dur="4.829">blaming all of this on Trump one thing</text>
  <text start="332.8" dur="4.739">after another and there&amp;#39;s a reason for</text>
  <text start="335.139" dur="4.471">this because we know right now from many</text>
  <text start="337.539" dur="6.781">different individuals like Charles men</text>
  <text start="339.61" dur="6.36">are cliff high Jim Rogers Harry dent</text>
  <text start="344.32" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re all calling for the same thing</text>
  <text start="345.97" dur="3.06">that something is going to happen the</text>
  <text start="347.74" dur="2.64">third quarter of this year and we can</text>
  <text start="349.03" dur="3.03">see that the corporate media the elite</text>
  <text start="350.38" dur="5.159">the central bankers they&amp;#39;re picking up</text>
  <text start="352.06" dur="7.28">on their story telling that Trump is to</text>
  <text start="355.539" dur="6.541">blame now we know that Japan China and</text>
  <text start="359.34" dur="5.35">many other countries Russia they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="362.08" dur="5.79">dumping Treasuries now Japan has dumped</text>
  <text start="364.69" dur="6.69">quite a bit of Treasuries since May of</text>
  <text start="367.87" dur="7.639">2013 and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="371.38" dur="6.99">Bloomberg again put out a story about</text>
  <text start="375.509" dur="6.551">creditors that are selling Treasuries</text>
  <text start="378.37" dur="8.07">because of Trump now creditors they</text>
  <text start="382.06" dur="8.19">don&amp;#39;t have as much Treasuries as Japan</text>
  <text start="386.44" dur="8.43">China Russia but they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="390.25" dur="9.18">create the idea that Treasuries are</text>
  <text start="394.87" dur="6.21">being dumped because of Trump and it</text>
  <text start="399.43" dur="3.299">went on to say that across the world</text>
  <text start="401.08" dur="3.589">foreigners are pulling back from the US</text>
  <text start="402.729" dur="5.131">debt like never before</text>
  <text start="404.669" dur="5.56">nevertheless any consistent drop-off in</text>
  <text start="407.86" dur="4.559">foreign demand could have lasting</text>
  <text start="410.229" dur="4.41">consequences on America&amp;#39;s ability to</text>
  <text start="412.419" dur="4.411">finance itself cheaply particularly in</text>
  <text start="414.639" dur="4.65">light of Trump&amp;#39;s ambitious plans to</text>
  <text start="416.83" dur="5.76">boost infrastructure spending cut taxes</text>
  <text start="419.289" dur="7.921">and put American first notice how they</text>
  <text start="422.59" dur="6.359">gloss over the fact that China Japan and</text>
  <text start="427.21" dur="3.78">Russia well they&amp;#39;ve been dumping</text>
  <text start="428.949" dur="3.9">Treasuries actually China has been</text>
  <text start="430.99" dur="4.98">calling its treasury holdings for seven</text>
  <text start="432.849" dur="6.151">years and that was all under Obama but</text>
  <text start="435.97" dur="5.79">they left that part out which is very</text>
  <text start="439" dur="4.44">interesting so you can see everything is</text>
  <text start="441.76" dur="3.48">being put together right now because</text>
  <text start="443.44" dur="5.15">they know what&amp;#39;s going to happen later</text>
  <text start="445.24" dur="5.36">on this year where the Econo</text>
  <text start="448.59" dur="5.04">starts deteriorating sorts to fall apart</text>
  <text start="450.6" dur="4.86">and they shut the spicket off and the</text>
  <text start="453.63" dur="3.36">Fed no longer is giving free money to</text>
  <text start="455.46" dur="3.57">the market and everything else when we</text>
  <text start="456.99" dur="4.59">see things start to really accelerate</text>
  <text start="459.03" dur="6.23">and everything start to rapidly decline</text>
  <text start="461.58" dur="6.66">now we know that Germany&amp;#39;s Bundeswehr</text>
  <text start="465.26" dur="6.22">ated all their gold 300 tons of gold and</text>
  <text start="468.24" dur="4.47">came from the Fed now the Fed originally</text>
  <text start="471.48" dur="3.69">said you know it&amp;#39;s going to take many</text>
  <text start="472.71" dur="6.33">many years to get this back to you now</text>
  <text start="475.17" dur="8.52">something very interesting happened with</text>
  <text start="479.04" dur="6.72">the gold bars they receive the gold but</text>
  <text start="483.69" dur="6.05">they noticed something very interesting</text>
  <text start="485.76" dur="8.16">that the gold bars they had different</text>
  <text start="489.74" dur="7.6">labels on them and what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="493.92" dur="7.62">is that these gold bars came from</text>
  <text start="497.34" dur="8.87">somewhere else which shows that the Fed</text>
  <text start="501.54" dur="6.75">most likely doesn&amp;#39;t have the gold</text>
  <text start="506.21" dur="4.36">because they&amp;#39;re saying that this wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="508.29" dur="6.48">the gold that we actually gave the Fed</text>
  <text start="510.57" dur="6.63">and we can see right now that this has</text>
  <text start="514.77" dur="4.26">been a conspiracy theory if you want to</text>
  <text start="517.2" dur="3.6">go down that path that the Fed really</text>
  <text start="519.03" dur="4.89">doesn&amp;#39;t have gold because every time</text>
  <text start="520.8" dur="5.43">they wanted to audit the gold guess what</text>
  <text start="523.92" dur="4.29">it was not allowed now if they actually</text>
  <text start="526.23" dur="5.67">have the gold what would be the problem</text>
  <text start="528.21" dur="6.12">in auditing it here it is see we told</text>
  <text start="531.9" dur="3.81">you but for them to say we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="534.33" dur="3.63">this to happen just like you don&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="535.71" dur="4.59">don&amp;#39;t want you to order the Fed well</text>
  <text start="537.96" dur="5.16">this is a major problem this shows that</text>
  <text start="540.3" dur="5.46">you&amp;#39;re hiding something and this should</text>
  <text start="543.12" dur="6.96">be open to the people of the United</text>
  <text start="545.76" dur="7.8">States because we are the people of this</text>
  <text start="550.08" dur="6.51">country and a private central bank</text>
  <text start="553.56" dur="6.98">should not be running the country its</text>
  <text start="556.59" dur="7.05">monetary system it should be removed now</text>
  <text start="560.54" dur="6.55">we see Christine Lagarde is out there</text>
  <text start="563.64" dur="4.95">and she is saying that trumps plans for</text>
  <text start="567.09" dur="3.84">additional investment in u.s.</text>
  <text start="568.59" dur="4.83">infrastructure and his likely tax</text>
  <text start="570.93" dur="6.21">reforms might boost America&amp;#39;s economic</text>
  <text start="573.42" dur="6.36">fortunes but Trump&amp;#39;s policies likely</text>
  <text start="577.14" dur="4.89">will squeeze international markets and</text>
  <text start="579.78" dur="5.46">things might start to unravel</text>
  <text start="582.03" dur="4.86">Avel and that&amp;#39;s a tightening that is</text>
  <text start="585.24" dur="3.69">going to be difficult on the global</text>
  <text start="586.89" dur="4.92">economy so we already have the IMF now</text>
  <text start="588.93" dur="5.25">saying that Trump&amp;#39;s policies well</text>
  <text start="591.81" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re going to have a prakrit a</text>
  <text start="594.18" dur="3.72">problem with the global economy so we</text>
  <text start="596.37" dur="5.16">have the IMF saying we&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="597.9" dur="6.12">a global economic problem because of</text>
  <text start="601.53" dur="4.2">Trump we have Fitch saying that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="604.02" dur="3.42">gonna have a problem here in the United</text>
  <text start="605.73" dur="4.38">States if he puts his economic policies</text>
  <text start="607.44" dur="5.52">forth we have Mario Draghi saying that</text>
  <text start="610.11" dur="5.19">yes if Trump puts his policies forth</text>
  <text start="612.96" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;re gonna have a problem in Europe you</text>
  <text start="615.3" dur="4.44">can see where they&amp;#39;re going with all</text>
  <text start="617.07" dur="4.59">this now of course Christine Lagarde is</text>
  <text start="619.74" dur="4.71">saying that centralization worked</text>
  <text start="621.66" dur="5.37">perfectly everything is fantastic we</text>
  <text start="624.45" dur="4.2">have free trade everywhere except for</text>
  <text start="627.03" dur="5.91">this really high unemployment except for</text>
  <text start="628.65" dur="7.4">these countries that are hugely in a lot</text>
  <text start="632.94" dur="6.12">of debt and they can&amp;#39;t service the debt</text>
  <text start="636.05" dur="5.08">but besides that besides all the people</text>
  <text start="639.06" dur="3.81">suffering who can&amp;#39;t find work can&amp;#39;t feed</text>
  <text start="641.13" dur="4.92">their families and these countries in a</text>
  <text start="642.87" dur="5.04">huge amount of debt and everything else</text>
  <text start="646.05" dur="4.14">that&amp;#39;s going on with negative interest</text>
  <text start="647.91" dur="3.99">rates it&amp;#39;s worked out absolutely</text>
  <text start="650.19" dur="3.47">perfectly and the reason why these</text>
  <text start="651.9" dur="3.9">people can&amp;#39;t find jobs because of</text>
  <text start="653.66" dur="4.93">technology robots they&amp;#39;re taking the</text>
  <text start="655.8" dur="5.34">jobs that&amp;#39;s exactly what she said quote</text>
  <text start="658.59" dur="5.31">we have been saying globalization is</text>
  <text start="661.14" dur="5.64">great international trade is great and</text>
  <text start="663.9" dur="5.07">it is she said but we have not looked at</text>
  <text start="666.78" dur="4.5">those who were badly negative impacted</text>
  <text start="668.97" dur="4.62">she blamed those negative impacts in</text>
  <text start="671.28" dur="4.98">part on the rise of robots taking jobs</text>
  <text start="673.59" dur="5.79">as well as the shrinking games of the</text>
  <text start="676.26" dur="5.16">global middle class well first of all</text>
  <text start="679.38" dur="7.2">the robots are they really taking the</text>
