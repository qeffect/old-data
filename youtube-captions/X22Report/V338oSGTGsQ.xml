  <text start="59.129" dur="4.56">unemployment is down by down to five</text>
  <text start="61.44" dur="5.46">percent and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>

  <text start="66.9" dur="6.06">the brick-and-mortar sales are not doing</text>
  <text start="70.83" dur="3.539">what everyone thought they were supposed</text>
  <text start="72.96" dur="4.409">to do because if you really think about</text>
  <text start="74.369" dur="4.741">it as unemployment continually drops you</text>
  <text start="77.369" dur="3.661">would think the sales would go up</text>

  <text start="91.56" dur="4.01">everyone has a job but this is not</text>

  <text start="127.68" dur="6.029">from the prior year&amp;#39;s third quarter and</text>

  <text start="133.709" dur="4.86">holiday season they&amp;#39;ll they won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="136.68" dur="5.16">able to pull out of where they&amp;#39;re headed</text>
  <text start="138.569" dur="5.31">and that is directly into a disaster the</text>
  <text start="141.84" dur="3.81">same with sears and there&amp;#39;s many other</text>
  <text start="143.879" dur="4.89">retailers are going to be reporting in</text>
  <text start="145.65" dur="5.58">that this holiday season was not good</text>

  <text start="152.34" dur="5.789">stores close coming 2016 just like we</text>
  <text start="154.95" dur="5.909">saw in 2015 and we&amp;#39;ll have to watch this</text>
  <text start="158.129" dur="6.421">very carefully as we go forward now</text>
  <text start="160.859" dur="6.121">Obama did something very interesting</text>
  <text start="164.55" dur="5.52">we know the government uses and has been</text>
  <text start="166.98" dur="7.41">creating all different type of stealth</text>
  <text start="170.07" dur="5.91">programs like FATCA the PFI see where</text>
  <text start="174.39" dur="5.01">the US government has steadily and</text>
  <text start="175.98" dur="7.23">quietly limit Americans ability to take</text>
  <text start="179.4" dur="7.44">cash out of the country and invest it in</text>
  <text start="183.21" dur="6.36">other areas and what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="186.84" dur="4.92">do is keep the cash here in the United</text>
  <text start="189.57" dur="5.52">States they&amp;#39;re going across the ocean</text>
  <text start="191.76" dur="5.85">looking for this cash trying to tax it</text>
  <text start="195.09" dur="5.34">to bring in revenue now the Federal</text>
  <text start="197.61" dur="5.22">Reserve went full ahead in the process</text>
  <text start="200.43" dur="5.34">of withdrawing about one trillion of</text>
  <text start="202.83" dur="5.25">liquidity to achieve the Fed rate</text>
  <text start="205.77" dur="5.67">decision of increasing it by point two</text>
  <text start="208.08" dur="7.65">five percent to counteract this policy</text>
  <text start="211.44" dur="8.22">initiative and basically the alarming</text>
  <text start="215.73" dur="5.94">collapse in the hy an IG bond market the</text>
  <text start="219.66" dur="4.65">US government immediately opened the</text>
  <text start="221.67" dur="6.11">floodgates to easy foreign credit in a</text>
  <text start="224.31" dur="5.73">major policy reversal a policy decision</text>
  <text start="227.78" dur="5.65">which was rushed through the Congress</text>
  <text start="230.04" dur="8.79">with almost no time for congressional</text>
  <text start="233.43" dur="7.71">debate fi our pta which is the foreign</text>
  <text start="238.83" dur="6.18">investment in real property tax act</text>
  <text start="241.14" dur="7.2">which was created back in nineteen</text>
  <text start="245.01" dur="5.76">eighty and it was in response to</text>
  <text start="248.34" dur="5.31">international investors in the 80s and</text>
  <text start="250.77" dur="5.63">early 90s from buying us farmland as</text>
  <text start="253.65" dur="7.26">well as the more publicly visible buying</text>
  <text start="256.4" dur="7.66">trophy us properties by the Japanese and</text>
  <text start="260.91" dur="7.65">the US government has now basically</text>
  <text start="264.06" dur="6.9">waived this so clearly the foreigners</text>
  <text start="268.56" dur="5.7">the one percent and property owners will</text>
  <text start="270.96" dur="5.43">all gain from this but most Americans</text>
  <text start="274.26" dur="4.86">will simply face significantly</text>
  <text start="276.39" dur="4.44">increasing property taxes so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="279.12" dur="4.2">seeing right now is they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="280.83" dur="5.339">open the floodgates for foreigners to</text>
  <text start="283.32" dur="6.36">come in and they&amp;#39;re going to have the</text>
  <text start="286.169" dur="5.311">ability to purchase all of this which is</text>
  <text start="289.68" dur="3.239">basically what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="291.48" dur="3.809">they&amp;#39;re trying to get the real estate</text>
  <text start="292.919" dur="4.891">moving they&amp;#39;re trying to send property</text>
  <text start="295.289" dur="3.181">values sky-high which means property</text>
  <text start="297.81" dur="2.64">taxes</text>
  <text start="298.47" dur="4.56">are going to increase and this is going</text>
  <text start="300.45" dur="3.93">to affect the everyday person this is</text>
  <text start="303.03" dur="4.47">how they&amp;#39;re trying to keep the system</text>
  <text start="304.38" dur="6.72">going because if we are in a recovery</text>
  <text start="307.5" dur="6.54">and everything was fine and real estate</text>
  <text start="311.1" dur="5.49">was doing well they wouldn&amp;#39;t need to do</text>
  <text start="314.04" dur="6.12">this we wouldn&amp;#39;t need 0% down we</text>
  <text start="316.59" dur="6.03">wouldn&amp;#39;t need the mortgage program where</text>
  <text start="320.16" dur="5.01">you where it allows other people to be</text>
  <text start="322.62" dur="5.1">included in your mortgage we wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="325.17" dur="5.46">need the closing costs covered we</text>
  <text start="327.72" dur="6.42">wouldn&amp;#39;t need other banks giving the</text>
  <text start="330.63" dur="7.02">zero percent down we wouldn&amp;#39;t need this</text>
  <text start="334.14" dur="6.36">law waived if we were truly in a</text>
  <text start="337.65" dur="6.63">recovery now everyone believes that the</text>
  <text start="340.5" dur="5.91">Fed has discontinued QE completely which</text>
  <text start="344.28" dur="5.01">is completely fake phony and false once</text>
  <text start="346.41" dur="5.34">again now under the meme that the</text>
  <text start="349.29" dur="4.67">economy is recovering Emily wait and</text>
  <text start="351.75" dur="4.169">they fed raised the interest rates</text>
  <text start="353.96" dur="3.73">basically what the Federal Reserve is</text>
  <text start="355.919" dur="4.441">doing now is saying they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="357.69" dur="4.89">continue to reinvest in the proceeds of</text>
  <text start="360.36" dur="4.44">the maturing agency debt and mortgage</text>
  <text start="362.58" dur="5.01">backed securities as well as the ink em</text>
  <text start="364.8" dur="5.58">on existing securities into new ones</text>
  <text start="367.59" dur="5.34">basically they are continuing</text>
  <text start="370.38" dur="7.23">quantitative easing and if you actually</text>
  <text start="372.93" dur="6.48">take a close look the total of value the</text>
  <text start="377.61" dur="3.33">total value of the mortgage backed</text>
  <text start="379.41" dur="5.03">securities on the balance sheet of the</text>
  <text start="380.94" dur="7.14">Federal Reserve continues to increase</text>
  <text start="384.44" dur="6.88">yes it&amp;#39;s slowed a little bit but if you</text>
  <text start="388.08" dur="5.64">look very closely on the one year chart</text>
  <text start="391.32" dur="5.7">you can clearly see the fed&amp;#39;s balance</text>
  <text start="393.72" dur="6.509">sheet is expanding since the first week</text>
  <text start="397.02" dur="7.41">of May the balance sheet has increased</text>
  <text start="400.229" dur="5.701">by additional two percent and if you</text>
  <text start="404.43" dur="3.42">look at the size of the total balance</text>
  <text start="405.93" dur="3.69">sheet of the Federal Reserve you clearly</text>
  <text start="407.85" dur="3.33">see the balance sheet hasn&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="409.62" dur="4.5">reduced at all but actually has</text>
  <text start="411.18" dur="6.66">increased in the past few months so</text>
  <text start="414.12" dur="7.83">they&amp;#39;re continually using QE they have</text>
  <text start="417.84" dur="7.77">not stopped whatsoever and again if we</text>
  <text start="421.95" dur="6.06">are in this incredible recovery all of</text>
  <text start="425.61" dur="6.119">this would not be needed at this time</text>
  <text start="428.01" dur="4.29">now out in Ukraine Ukrainian Air Force</text>
  <text start="431.729" dur="3.991">is</text>
  <text start="432.3" dur="6.66">ceiving military equipment from the</text>
  <text start="435.72" dur="6.09">United States government because we</text>
  <text start="438.96" dur="6.72">understand at this point everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="441.81" dur="5.639">fitting into place the travel warning</text>
  <text start="445.68" dur="4.229">from the United States for US citizens</text>
  <text start="447.449" dur="4.44">to get out of Crimea and the</text>
  <text start="449.909" dur="4.831">southeastern regions and not to travel</text>
  <text start="451.889" dur="4.921">there we see that military assets have</text>
  <text start="454.74" dur="4.79">been moved up to the contact lines we</text>
  <text start="456.81" dur="5.729">know the mints to cease fire agreement</text>
  <text start="459.53" dur="5.65">expires at the end of this year we know</text>
  <text start="462.539" dur="4.981">there&amp;#39;s extremists that are going to do</text>
  <text start="465.18" dur="4.109">something on the Kerch Strait we see</text>
  <text start="467.52" dur="4.92">that Ukraine has already defaulted on</text>
  <text start="469.289" dur="5.85">the Russian government bond it looks</text>
  <text start="472.44" dur="4.729">like at this point they&amp;#39;re preparing</text>
  <text start="475.139" dur="7.02">they&amp;#39;re getting ready for another</text>
  <text start="477.169" dur="7.391">offensive now Iran will export 9,000</text>
  <text start="482.159" dur="5.581">tons of enriched uranium to Russia</text>
  <text start="484.56" dur="5.94">within the next couple of days and this</text>
  <text start="487.74" dur="5.91">is all part of the agreement Iran has</text>
  <text start="490.5" dur="5.19">made with other nations and under the</text>
  <text start="493.65" dur="4.5">nuclear deal Turan has to limit its</text>
  <text start="495.69" dur="5.069">stockpile of enriched uranium to around</text>
  <text start="498.15" dur="4.29">300 kilograms the enriched uranium</text>
  <text start="500.759" dur="4.291">stockpile will be swapped for yellowcake</text>
  <text start="502.44" dur="4.74">unenriched uranium compound already</text>
  <text start="505.05" dur="6.619">supplied by Russia the yellow cake is a</text>
  <text start="507.18" dur="7.59">non military use only which ensures</text>
  <text start="511.669" dur="6.851">Iran&amp;#39;s nuclear program is completely</text>
  <text start="514.77" dur="6.269">peaceful now the United States</text>
  <text start="518.52" dur="4.86">government central bankers they are</text>
  <text start="521.039" dur="4.501">trying to get more drone pilots because</text>
  <text start="523.38" dur="6.06">what they&amp;#39;re having now is a huge huge</text>
  <text start="525.54" dur="7.59">problem because drone pilots have been</text>
  <text start="529.44" dur="6">hitting civilians and a lot of the drone</text>
  <text start="533.13" dur="4.92">pilots are having a problem with this</text>
  <text start="535.44" dur="4.98">and some of the pilots are complaining</text>
  <text start="538.05" dur="4.039">of anguish and emotional damage that</text>
  <text start="540.42" dur="3.84">comes with murdering women and children</text>
  <text start="542.089" dur="6.37">while pretending to be in a video game</text>
  <text start="544.26" dur="6.84">type of scenario and we can see at this</text>
  <text start="548.459" dur="4.681">point the Air Force has offered a</text>
  <text start="551.1" dur="3.929">retention bonus of fifteen thousand</text>
  <text start="553.14" dur="4.29">dollars a year for drone pilots</text>
  <text start="555.029" dur="5.93">apparently $15,000 was out enough to</text>
  <text start="557.43" dur="8.42">bring them back in so they upped it to</text>
  <text start="560.959" dur="8.771">125,000 so those who reenlist can</text>
  <text start="565.85" dur="8.58">125,000 in 25,000 installments over five</text>
  <text start="569.73" dur="8.4">years or get the first 62,500 up front</text>
  <text start="574.43" dur="5.35">so we can see right now many of the</text>
  <text start="578.13" dur="4.65">pilots are really having a problem with</text>
  <text start="579.78" dur="4.5">this because they don&amp;#39;t know if these</text>
  <text start="582.78" dur="5.49">people are actually terrorists and</text>
  <text start="584.28" dur="7.8">you&amp;#39;re killing women children and anyone</text>
  <text start="588.27" dur="6.72">else who&amp;#39;s in that area and again this</text>
  <text start="592.08" dur="5.52">is no trial there&amp;#39;s no real evidence</text>
  <text start="594.99" dur="5.49">that they&amp;#39;ve done anything these are</text>
  <text start="597.6" dur="6.21">targets that are just handed down from</text>
  <text start="600.48" dur="8.39">the government now a newly leaked report</text>
  <text start="603.81" dur="8.31">from Norway basically proves that</text>
  <text start="608.87" dur="7.48">Erdogan and his family have been</text>
  <text start="612.12" dur="8.64">smuggling oil from Iraq and Syria into</text>
  <text start="616.35" dur="6.84">Turkey and what has happened here is</text>
  <text start="620.76" dur="5.61">that this report was compiled by Norway</text>
  <text start="623.19" dur="6.27">and it revealed that most of the Islamic</text>

  <text start="657.78" dur="4.71">implicated turkish President her one and</text>
  <text start="660.78" dur="3.9">the oil trade with the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="662.49" dur="5.22">according to our data the top political</text>
  <text start="664.68" dur="6.45">leaders of the country president Erdogan</text>
  <text start="667.71" dur="7.23">and his family are involved in this</text>
  <text start="671.13" dur="7.04">criminal business so we can see again</text>
  <text start="674.94" dur="6.24">the United States knew all about this</text>
  <text start="678.17" dur="4.06">the Islamic state is the proxy army for</text>

  <text start="682.23" dur="4.26">bankers they knew exactly where this oil</text>
  <text start="684.75" dur="3.99">was going and this is why the convoys</text>

  <text start="692.13" dur="5.13">where they are where they&amp;#39;re going but</text>
  <text start="694.23" dur="5.04">they were never hit until Russia pointed</text>
  <text start="697.26" dur="4.68">this out</text>
  <text start="699.27" dur="6.93">now the Iraqi government is complaining</text>
  <text start="701.94" dur="7.98">that US has deliberately hindering the</text>

  <text start="968.399" dur="7.111">has to go around to fight the terrorism</text>
  <text start="971.85" dur="4.92">now of course Germany turkey and the</text>
  <text start="975.51" dur="4.23">other coalition&amp;#39;s are saying they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="976.77" dur="5.49">fighting the terrorists but they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="979.74" dur="6.96">allow Russia to fly their bombers across</text>

  <text start="986.7" dur="4.17">stopped Russia whatsoever they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="988.56" dur="3.899">carried out 145 sorties against the</text>
  <text start="990.87" dur="4.92">terrorists using their long-range</text>
  <text start="992.459" dur="7.171">bombers hitting many of their targets</text>
  <text start="995.79" dur="7.049">now earlier this month Israel has been</text>
  <text start="999.63" dur="6.45">conducting tests against the s-300</text>
  <text start="1002.839" dur="5.31">missile system in Crete Israel has</text>
  <text start="1006.08" dur="4.64">quietly tested ways of defeating an</text>
  <text start="1008.149" dur="5.071">advanced air defense system by Russia</text>
  <text start="1010.72" dur="4.989">which was deployed in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="1013.22" dur="6.42">and that could limit Israel&amp;#39;s ability to</text>
  <text start="1015.709" dur="6.331">strike in Syria or a ram Russia&amp;#39;s s-300</text>
  <text start="1019.64" dur="4.919">anti-aircraft system sold to Cyprus 18</text>
  <text start="1022.04" dur="4.56">years ago but now located on the Greek</text>
  <text start="1024.559" dur="4.38">island of Crete has been activated</text>
  <text start="1026.6" dur="4.829">during joint drills between Greek and</text>
  <text start="1028.939" dur="6.451">Israeli forces in April and May of this</text>
  <text start="1031.429" dur="8.16">year Russia is set the supply I ran with</text>
  <text start="1035.39" dur="6.39">the s-300s or maybe the 400s worth some</text>
  <text start="1039.589" dur="5.73">800 million and we know they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="1041.78" dur="6.779">receiving it and Israel is continually</text>
  <text start="1045.319" dur="6.001">testing to see if there&amp;#39;s a way to get</text>
  <text start="1048.559" dur="6.091">into Syria to hit certain targets</text>
  <text start="1051.32" dur="5.73">without getting shot down by the Russian</text>
  <text start="1054.65" dur="4.95">defence system because we know in Syria</text>
  <text start="1057.05" dur="4.59">right now that Assad has been receiving</text>
  <text start="1059.6" dur="6.57">the s-300 and Russia has set up their</text>
  <text start="1061.64" dur="6.3">more advanced as 400 in Syria and Israel</text>
  <text start="1066.17" dur="3.54">is trying to figure out ways of getting</text>
  <text start="1067.94" dur="5.61">around this now since they set up this</text>
  <text start="1069.71" dur="7.05">no-fly zone basically in Syria British</text>
  <text start="1073.55" dur="5.52">planes us planes French planes have</text>
  <text start="1076.76" dur="4.919">really not been flying in Syria and</text>
  <text start="1079.07" dur="4.68">hitting their targets one reason is</text>
  <text start="1081.679" dur="4.741">because Russia is watching very closely</text>
  <text start="1083.75" dur="4.29">and what they hit secondly they&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="1086.42" dur="3.69">little nervous about the air defense</text>
  <text start="1088.04" dur="3.93">system because if they&amp;#39;re flying in</text>
  <text start="1090.11" dur="3.36">areas where they&amp;#39;re not supposed to be</text>
  <text start="1091.97" dur="3.12">and hitting targets are not supposed to</text>
  <text start="1093.47" dur="4.08">be there going to be shot down</text>
  <text start="1095.09" dur="4.949">especially with Assad receiving the</text>
  <text start="1097.55" dur="6.15">s-300s he&amp;#39;ll def</text>
  <text start="1100.039" dur="7.561">we shoot them down because again England</text>
