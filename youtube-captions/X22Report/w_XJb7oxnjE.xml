  <text start="108.94" dur="5.76">financial news now we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="111.759" dur="5.881">about the retail market where retail</text>
  <text start="114.7" dur="4.529">stores they&amp;#39;re taking a huge hit and a</text>
  <text start="117.64" dur="3.539">lot of stores that they&amp;#39;ve been going</text>
  <text start="119.229" dur="4.051">bankrupt they&amp;#39;ve been closing down and</text>
  <text start="121.179" dur="3.841">what we need to understand it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="123.28" dur="3.72">that it&amp;#39;s not just happening here in the</text>
  <text start="125.02" dur="4.019">United States it is happening in</text>
  <text start="127" dur="4.92">Australia it&amp;#39;s happening in Canada it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="129.039" dur="5.641">happening out in the UK and it looks</text>
  <text start="131.92" dur="4.319">like right now retailer new look looks</text>
  <text start="134.68" dur="5.25">like they&amp;#39;re gonna be closing about 60</text>
  <text start="136.239" dur="5.371">stores and we see right now that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="139.93" dur="3.27">having difficulties now of course</text>
  <text start="141.61" dur="3.06">they&amp;#39;re saying because of online and</text>
  <text start="143.2" dur="3.6">everything like that but what is</text>
  <text start="144.67" dur="4.47">happening right now is that this is</text>
  <text start="146.8" dur="4.29">spreading to many many countries where</text>
  <text start="149.14" dur="4.709">the retailers that have a</text>
  <text start="151.09" dur="5.07">brick-and-mortar store plus they have an</text>
  <text start="153.849" dur="3.481">online presence they can&amp;#39;t make it</text>
  <text start="156.16" dur="4.89">Toys R Us right now is completely</text>
  <text start="157.33" dur="6.42">liquidating and the situation is getting</text>
  <text start="161.05" dur="4.26">worse and worse and worse and this has</text>
  <text start="163.75" dur="4.47">nothing to do with the brexit or</text>
  <text start="165.31" dur="6.66">anything like that what they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="168.22" dur="6.45">you to know is that the people who don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="171.97" dur="5.73">have jobs or they&amp;#39;ve gotten a new job</text>
  <text start="174.67" dur="5.28">but they&amp;#39;re making a lot less money they</text>
  <text start="177.7" dur="4.2">can&amp;#39;t go out and spend these funds</text>
  <text start="179.95" dur="3.84">because they just don&amp;#39;t have it they</text>
  <text start="181.9" dur="3.479">don&amp;#39;t want people to know this so what</text>
  <text start="183.79" dur="2.97">they do is they make up cover up the</text>
  <text start="185.379" dur="3.421">maker they make cover stories</text>
  <text start="186.76" dur="4.229">sometimes they use the weather oh it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="188.8" dur="4.14">been bad weather so this is why retail</text>
  <text start="190.989" dur="4.321">is getting hit and of course bad weather</text>
  <text start="192.94" dur="4.049">is not across the globe yeah maybe we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="195.31" dur="4.17">have a snow storm in the Northeast but</text>
  <text start="196.989" dur="4.17">the rest of the country is fine and</text>
  <text start="199.48" dur="3.72">while it&amp;#39;s snowing here in the Northeast</text>
  <text start="201.159" dur="4.201">it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that Canada is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="203.2" dur="3.78">snowing it doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s bad weather</text>
  <text start="205.36" dur="4.14">in Australia it doesn&amp;#39;t mean there&amp;#39;s bad</text>
  <text start="206.98" dur="5.759">weather in the UK and what they tried to</text>
  <text start="209.5" dur="5.489">do is they continually use the idea that</text>
  <text start="212.739" dur="4.67">it&amp;#39;s bad weather and then they switch to</text>
  <text start="214.989" dur="4.59">online well online is taking over and</text>
  <text start="217.409" dur="6.461">this is why we see all this happening</text>
  <text start="219.579" dur="5.611">but again the numbers don&amp;#39;t add up now</text>
  <text start="223.87" dur="4.02">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="225.19" dur="5.639">seeing a lot of indicators and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="227.89" dur="5.04">been watching the credit card usage it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="230.829" dur="4.47">skyrocketed during the holiday season</text>
  <text start="232.93" dur="3.54">and most likely because people just</text>
  <text start="235.299" dur="2.701">couldn&amp;#39;t afford to go out and purchase</text>
  <text start="236.47" dur="3.629">gifts but they still wanted to get gifts</text>
  <text start="238" dur="4.23">for their families so they use the</text>
  <text start="240.099" dur="5.22">credit cards and of course now we see</text>
  <text start="242.23" dur="7.379">credit card usage slowing down but when</text>
  <text start="245.319" dur="6.6">we look at what happened back in 2008 we</text>
  <text start="249.609" dur="6.051">see that credit card usage increased</text>
  <text start="251.919" dur="7.56">increased increased until it hit a</text>
  <text start="255.66" dur="5.859">breaking point in 2008 and it started to</text>
  <text start="259.479" dur="4.5">decline and then it declined a little</text>
  <text start="261.519" dur="5.281">bit more we had a like a little dead cat</text>
  <text start="263.979" dur="5.461">bounce and it just came crashing down we</text>
  <text start="266.8" dur="5.4">are at that point now remember the</text>
  <text start="269.44" dur="6.75">revolving consumer credit rate right now</text>
  <text start="272.2" dur="7.13">is higher than it was in 2008 and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="276.19" dur="6.479">already started the trajectory of</text>
  <text start="279.33" dur="6.459">declining downward now we might see a</text>
  <text start="282.669" dur="5.611">dead count bounce but this is going to</text>
  <text start="285.789" dur="5.161">pick up steam we&amp;#39;re seeing the same</text>
  <text start="288.28" dur="5.19">thing happen once again remember student</text>
  <text start="290.95" dur="3.81">loans automobile loans they&amp;#39;re hitting</text>
  <text start="293.47" dur="4.62">all-time highs</text>
  <text start="294.76" dur="6.93">now the sharp slowdown in consumer</text>
  <text start="298.09" dur="9">credit growth is a red flag that the US</text>
  <text start="301.69" dur="8.43">economy is not doing well at all now if</text>
  <text start="307.09" dur="5.6">the economy&amp;#39;s doing well then US</text>
  <text start="310.12" dur="4.53">companies would be doing fantastic</text>
  <text start="312.69" dur="3.64">because they&amp;#39;ve been telling us that</text>
  <text start="314.65" dur="2.67">we&amp;#39;re in this incredible economic</text>
  <text start="316.33" dur="2.61">recovery</text>
  <text start="317.32" dur="4.11">now baroque live</text>
  <text start="318.94" dur="3.9">is the Philip bards professor of</text>
  <text start="321.43" dur="5.7">accounting of finance at the Stern</text>
  <text start="322.84" dur="8.97">School of Business NYU and he started to</text>
  <text start="327.13" dur="6.39">look at how companies were doing now of</text>
  <text start="331.81" dur="4.02">course the corporate media is out there</text>
  <text start="333.52" dur="4.19">and they&amp;#39;re telling us no the stock</text>
  <text start="335.83" dur="3.93">market is hitting all-time highs</text>
  <text start="337.71" dur="4.84">unemployment is the lowest we&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="339.76" dur="4.95">seen consumer confidence is the highest</text>
  <text start="342.55" dur="3.72">I mean actually if you look at this this</text>
  <text start="344.71" dur="3.96">is exactly what was happening back in</text>
  <text start="346.27" dur="6.39">2008 when we went right into a recession</text>
  <text start="348.67" dur="6.98">and the market crashed so they started</text>
  <text start="352.66" dur="6.6">to look at different numbers here on</text>
  <text start="355.65" dur="6.19">corporations and most likely you were</text>
  <text start="359.26" dur="5.67">going to be shocked to see the following</text>
  <text start="361.84" dur="5.04">figures which really hasn&amp;#39;t been seen</text>
  <text start="364.93" dur="4.92">anywhere else nor mentioned by</text>
  <text start="366.88" dur="6.96">economists or pundits now the figure</text>
  <text start="369.85" dur="7.8">shows that US public companies they are</text>
  <text start="373.84" dur="6.21">reporting annual losses we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="377.65" dur="4.89">the technology firms and all other firms</text>
  <text start="380.05" dur="5.82">and what he did is he went back in time</text>
  <text start="382.54" dur="5.78">and he went back to 1960 and since that</text>
  <text start="385.87" dur="6.299">time from 1960 moving forward</text>
  <text start="388.32" dur="6.04">corporations have been losing money now</text>
  <text start="392.169" dur="5.431">if we look at this we can see that all</text>
  <text start="394.36" dur="5.76">firms back in the 90s will go back to</text>
  <text start="397.6" dur="6.15">that point in time they had about a 30%</text>
  <text start="400.12" dur="6.03">loss today the losses around 45% now</text>
  <text start="403.75" dur="5.25">that&amp;#39;s all firms science-based</text>
  <text start="406.15" dur="5.37">and technology firms back in the 90s</text>
  <text start="409" dur="8.88">they were losing money around 45% and</text>
  <text start="411.52" dur="8.94">today it&amp;#39;s closer to 69% so we can see</text>
  <text start="417.88" dur="5.67">right now that the percent losses from</text>
  <text start="420.46" dur="7.56">all companies increased from 18% in 1980</text>
  <text start="423.55" dur="5.82">to 46% in 2016 for high-tech and</text>
  <text start="428.02" dur="6.36">science-based companies a loser&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="429.37" dur="7.53">reached 69% in 2016 so where is the</text>
  <text start="434.38" dur="5.34">economic recovery if half the companies</text>
  <text start="436.9" dur="5.46">are reporting losses shouldn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="439.72" dur="4.92">recovery be reflected by an increasing</text>
  <text start="442.36" dur="4.29">number of profitable companies we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="444.64" dur="4.35">just not seeing it now there was a</text>
  <text start="446.65" dur="5.69">strategic investment conference that was</text>
  <text start="448.99" dur="5.63">kicked off in 2018 in San Diego</text>
  <text start="452.34" dur="6.39">the keynote speech was given by David</text>
  <text start="454.62" dur="7.92">Rosenberg and Rosenberg began by running</text>
  <text start="458.73" dur="6.51">through a list of his own metrics Ford</text>
  <text start="462.54" dur="6.75">PE price sales price book value</text>
  <text start="465.24" dur="6.209">enterprise value and he started to point</text>
  <text start="469.29" dur="4.56">out certain things when he started to</text>
  <text start="471.449" dur="5.371">look at the economy and what has been</text>
  <text start="473.85" dur="5.819">going on he pointed out that even the</text>
  <text start="476.82" dur="4.89">Fed admits that valuations are high our</text>
  <text start="479.669" dur="4.821">policymakers themselves believe this</text>
  <text start="481.71" dur="6.84">can&amp;#39;t continue for long in fact Shiller</text>
  <text start="484.49" dur="6.28">the Shiller Cape ratio now stands at its</text>
  <text start="488.55" dur="4.74">second highest level in decades history</text>
  <text start="490.77" dur="4.44">shows that high p/e ratios are usually</text>
  <text start="493.29" dur="5.01">followed by years of low returns in</text>
  <text start="495.21" dur="5.61">equities in fact even the San Francisco</text>
  <text start="498.3" dur="5.04">fed now predicts that equity returns</text>
  <text start="500.82" dur="6.96">over the next decade will be at best</text>
  <text start="503.34" dur="7.139">zero percent he&amp;#39;s also saying that there</text>
  <text start="507.78" dur="5.55">are credit warnings what does he mean by</text>
  <text start="510.479" dur="5.25">this well he&amp;#39;s saying that credit is one</text>
  <text start="513.33" dur="5.519">of the biggest recession threats to be</text>
  <text start="515.729" dur="5.971">observed in this late cycle behavior by</text>
  <text start="518.849" dur="4.74">looking at the erosion of the credit</text>
  <text start="521.7" dur="5.09">quality as one of the warning signals</text>
  <text start="523.589" dur="6.331">and we&amp;#39;ve talked about credit before</text>
  <text start="526.79" dur="6.669">that there&amp;#39;s going to be a huge problem</text>
  <text start="529.92" dur="6.39">he says that the former big buyers of</text>
  <text start="533.459" dur="6.021">corporate debt have started to pull back</text>
  <text start="536.31" dur="6.96">the situation on retail side isn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="539.48" dur="6.13">better he pointed out that consumers</text>
  <text start="543.27" dur="4.8">begin to struggle to make credit card</text>
  <text start="545.61" dur="5.82">payments and this is a sure sign that</text>
  <text start="548.07" dur="5.459">things are completely breaking apart now</text>
  <text start="551.43" dur="4.74">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all of</text>
  <text start="553.529" dur="6.091">this and the Fed has gone to great</text>
  <text start="556.17" dur="9.539">lengths to let us know that our banking</text>
  <text start="559.62" dur="10.86">system is solid that every major bank</text>
  <text start="565.709" dur="8.011">the credit unions they&amp;#39;re good to go but</text>
  <text start="570.48" dur="6.75">when we start to look at certain numbers</text>
  <text start="573.72" dur="5.22">and we start to delve into them we see a</text>
  <text start="577.23" dur="4.229">completely different picture it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="578.94" dur="5.25">like going back to the subprime security</text>
  <text start="581.459" dur="4.19">market when those coupled with a couple</text>
  <text start="584.19" dur="4.119">of individuals start</text>
  <text start="585.649" dur="5.821">to look inside and say hmm wait a minute</text>
  <text start="588.309" dur="5.171">these people haven&amp;#39;t made payments these</text>
  <text start="591.47" dur="4.559">people have defaulted the subprime</text>
  <text start="593.48" dur="4.62">securities they are not rated triple-a</text>
  <text start="596.029" dur="4.35">they shouldn&amp;#39;t be why are they this</text>
  <text start="598.1" dur="5.909">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense whatsoever now</text>
  <text start="600.379" dur="8.55">remember if we go and look at the bank</text>
  <text start="604.009" dur="7.17">in Latvia that just got bailed out they</text>
  <text start="608.929" dur="7.801">had a bank run and it collapsed their</text>
  <text start="611.179" dur="8.1">cash to deposit ratio was 13% now let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="616.73" dur="9.389">think about this for a second their cash</text>
  <text start="619.279" dur="10.23">to deposit ratio was 13% JPMorgan if we</text>
  <text start="626.119" dur="7.351">look at what they have here 98 percent</text>
  <text start="629.509" dur="8.851">of deposits are not covered so they</text>
  <text start="633.47" dur="6.51">cover about 1.7 4 % Wells Fargo 98</text>
  <text start="638.36" dur="4.469">percent of their deposits are not</text>
  <text start="639.98" dur="6.81">covered so about 1.5 9 is covered with</text>
  <text start="642.829" dur="6.54">cash on him goldman sachs 98.76 or their</text>
  <text start="646.79" dur="4.2">deposits are not covered alpha bank in</text>

  <text start="662.959" dur="7.081">system is completely insolvent yes they</text>
  <text start="667.16" dur="4.89">had their stress tests yes they make us</text>
  <text start="670.04" dur="3.899">believe that everything is great just</text>
  <text start="672.05" dur="4.68">like they told us that AIG would only</text>
  <text start="673.939" dur="4.681">need one bailout they had all the other</text>
  <text start="676.73" dur="3.209">companies there fine the financial</text>
  <text start="678.62" dur="2.909">solutions they&amp;#39;re fine they don&amp;#39;t need</text>

  <text start="681.529" dur="6">that everyone needed a bailout what</text>
  <text start="685.37" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re keeping us in</text>
  <text start="687.529" dur="7.17">this illusion it is time to wake up</text>
  <text start="691.04" dur="6.899">and we can see right now that Trump is</text>
  <text start="694.699" dur="5.82">pushing his agenda by pushing tariffs</text>
  <text start="697.939" dur="3.39">right now Coen decided that he couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="700.519" dur="3.66">take it anymore</text>
  <text start="701.329" dur="4.95">I mean Trump even made a joke that he</text>
  <text start="704.179" dur="4.77">still likes him even though he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="706.279" dur="4.74">globalist and we can see that there are</text>
  <text start="708.949" dur="4.291">going to be many individuals that are</text>
  <text start="711.019" dur="4.651">gonna jump ship right now because this</text>
  <text start="713.24" dur="4.409">is not what they want they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="715.67" dur="3.6">this they&amp;#39;d like their system they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="717.649" dur="3.901">they made a lot Cohen is</text>
  <text start="719.27" dur="5.73">made a lot of money off of this system</text>
  <text start="721.55" dur="6.3">and they like it they don&amp;#39;t want it to</text>
  <text start="725" dur="7.05">end because they have the insider</text>
  <text start="727.85" dur="5.88">information and the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="732.05" dur="3.42">all out there and they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="733.73" dur="3.96">sense of this and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="735.47" dur="4.41">it&amp;#39;s going to ruin the economy because</text>
  <text start="737.69" dur="4.2">what he&amp;#39;s doing and we&amp;#39;re not gonna it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="739.88" dur="4.8">not gonna help you economy his plan is</text>
  <text start="741.89" dur="6.09">not to help this economy his plan is to</text>
  <text start="744.68" dur="5.64">take down their economy the central</text>
  <text start="747.98" dur="4.62">banking economy now of course the</text>
  <text start="750.32" dur="5.01">throwing numbers out there like America</text>
  <text start="752.6" dur="5.34">imports 90% of the aluminum that US</text>
  <text start="755.33" dur="4.47">companies used to make products and this</text>
  <text start="757.94" dur="4.98">is coming out of the Washington Post the</text>
  <text start="759.8" dur="6.78">New York Times and looking into these</text>
  <text start="762.92" dur="8.19">numbers well it&amp;#39;s not exactly true</text>
  <text start="766.58" dur="6.96">in 2016 the United States imported five</text>
  <text start="771.11" dur="5.73">times as much primary aluminum on</text>
  <text start="773.54" dur="6.15">tonnage basis as it produced the report</text>
  <text start="776.84" dur="5.67">explains the import penetration level</text>
  <text start="779.69" dur="6.3">was about 90 percent up from 66 percent</text>
  <text start="782.51" dur="6.36">in 2012 but what reporting by these</text>
  <text start="785.99" dur="6.21">outlets overlooked is that the figure</text>
  <text start="788.87" dur="5.25">does not capture the entire US unlimite</text>
  <text start="792.2" dur="4.77">market it only reflects the production</text>
  <text start="794.12" dur="5.07">and trade of primary aluminum or</text>
  <text start="796.97" dur="5.58">aluminium that has been smelted from raw</text>
  <text start="799.19" dur="5.46">ore most unwrought or unfinished</text>
  <text start="802.55" dur="4.41">aluminum that the US produces on the</text>
  <text start="804.65" dur="5.7">other hand is recycled and remote and</text>
  <text start="806.96" dur="7.05">scrap or secondary aluminum which means</text>
  <text start="810.35" dur="6.93">that the u.s. imports about a little</text>
  <text start="814.01" dur="5.28">over 50 percent it&amp;#39;s not ninety percent</text>
  <text start="817.28" dur="4.2">but of course the corporate media is out</text>
  <text start="819.29" dur="5.1">there they&amp;#39;re out there telling you how</text>
  <text start="821.48" dur="4.59">bad this is now of course whatever</text>
  <text start="824.39" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re saying whatever the corporate</text>
  <text start="826.07" dur="4.59">media says whatever the central bank</text>
  <text start="827.51" dur="6.87">says whatever the government says always</text>
  <text start="830.66" dur="5.97">take it as the opposite because just</text>
  <text start="834.38" dur="4.65">like the Patriot Act the Patriot Act is</text>
  <text start="836.63" dur="5.61">not for the Patriots the u.s. Freedom</text>
  <text start="839.03" dur="5.43">Act the Affordable Care Act it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="842.24" dur="4.62">the opposite of what they&amp;#39;re telling you</text>
  <text start="844.46" dur="3.99">the Fed says they&amp;#39;re not gonna let</text>
  <text start="846.86" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re not forecasting recession in the</text>
  <text start="848.45" dur="4.41">year 2008 we had a recession it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="851.21" dur="4.17">the opposite</text>
  <text start="852.86" dur="4.44">we see already the central banks because</text>
  <text start="855.38" dur="3.72">of what Trump is doing they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="857.3" dur="3.75">their moves we know that the Fed they</text>
  <text start="859.1" dur="3.39">were trying to bring down the economy by</text>
  <text start="861.05" dur="2.52">raising the interest rates they might</text>
  <text start="862.49" dur="3.39">stop that right now</text>
  <text start="863.57" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re unwinding the ECB is saying that</text>
  <text start="865.88" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re gonna start unwinding and we</text>
  <text start="867.86" dur="4.8">could see right now that they are</text>
  <text start="869.51" dur="6.18">pushing their agenda Trump is pushing</text>
  <text start="872.66" dur="6.53">his agenda and we see that we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="875.69" dur="6.54">be heading to a faceoff eventually</text>
  <text start="879.19" dur="6.37">someone needs to control the narrative</text>
  <text start="882.23" dur="7.38">and the only way to do that is to take</text>
  <text start="885.56" dur="6.99">control of the economy to force it in</text>
  <text start="889.61" dur="6.57">the direction that you want the central</text>
  <text start="892.55" dur="5.729">bankers throughout all these years have</text>
  <text start="896.18" dur="4.26">been pushing the economy in their</text>
  <text start="898.279" dur="4.471">direction in the direction of the deep</text>
  <text start="900.44" dur="5.37">state in the direction that they want so</text>
  <text start="902.75" dur="5.37">they can move the system to their brand</text>
  <text start="905.81" dur="6.899">new system that they&amp;#39;re creating out in</text>
  <text start="908.12" dur="6.81">the East this is what they want Trump is</text>
  <text start="912.709" dur="6.63">trying to take the narrative away from</text>
  <text start="914.93" dur="6.18">them and push the blame on them</text>
  <text start="919.339" dur="4.111">eventually that&amp;#39;s what is going to</text>
  <text start="921.11" dur="4.65">happen just like when we talked about</text>
  <text start="923.45" dur="4.949">North Korea and everyone thought we were</text>
  <text start="925.76" dur="5.37">going to war and we kept on reporting</text>
  <text start="928.399" dur="5.041">that no there are peace talks happening</text>
  <text start="931.13" dur="4.53">behind the scenes of course people a lot</text>
  <text start="933.44" dur="5.19">of people wrote in and laughed and did</text>
  <text start="935.66" dur="4.98">whatever but that is exactly what was</text>
  <text start="938.63" dur="6.209">happening at that time the same thing is</text>
  <text start="940.64" dur="7.35">happening right now and the central</text>
  <text start="944.839" dur="5.431">banks they are worried they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="947.99" dur="4.77">nervous they&amp;#39;re very afraid we have this</text>
  <text start="950.27" dur="4.68">audit bill that&amp;#39;s going to be voted on</text>
  <text start="952.76" dur="4.92">hopefully it gets through because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="954.95" dur="5.37">now as an amendment on the Senate</text>
  <text start="957.68" dur="3.96">Banking bill which most likely it will</text>
  <text start="960.32" dur="3.209">go through and we know that Trump is</text>
  <text start="961.64" dur="3.33">going to sign it he has Andrew Jackson</text>
  <text start="963.529" dur="4.741">hanging on the wall in the White House</text>
  <text start="964.97" dur="6.27">which means he&amp;#39;s gonna go through the</text>
  <text start="968.27" dur="5.1">Fed and of course an independent agency</text>
  <text start="971.24" dur="5.61">is gonna go through it and find out what</text>
  <text start="973.37" dur="6.3">they&amp;#39;ve been up to this is about a reset</text>
  <text start="976.85" dur="5.07">a reset just doesn&amp;#39;t mean the economy is</text>
  <text start="979.67" dur="6.659">gonna crash and then a new ones going to</text>
  <text start="981.92" dur="8.399">start up a reset means that the entire</text>
  <text start="986.329" dur="5.73">system needs to be reset because if the</text>
  <text start="990.319" dur="4.351">economy just crashes and it&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="992.059" dur="5.671">group of individuals running it</text>
  <text start="994.67" dur="5.969">there was no reset it just crashed and</text>
  <text start="997.73" dur="5.969">came back up we&amp;#39;re exactly in the same</text>
  <text start="1000.639" dur="5.281">spot a reset is get rid of getting rid</text>
  <text start="1003.699" dur="4.14">of the central bank a reset is removing</text>
  <text start="1005.92" dur="4.68">those corrupt individuals from</text>
  <text start="1007.839" dur="5.28">government a reset is bringing us to a</text>
  <text start="1010.6" dur="5.219">brand new system resetting everything</text>
  <text start="1013.119" dur="4.62">and that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re headed right now</text>
  <text start="1015.819" dur="3.45">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="1017.739" dur="4.921">corporate media has been out there and</text>
  <text start="1019.269" dur="6.991">we know the IMF the biz the the New York</text>
  <text start="1022.66" dur="5.46">Fed minutia and the rest they cannot</text>
  <text start="1026.26" dur="3.269">stand crypto currencies the banks have</text>
  <text start="1028.12" dur="4.169">already said this is a threat to their</text>
  <text start="1029.529" dur="4.92">business and every time Bitcoin goes</text>
  <text start="1032.289" dur="3.331">down they say see it&amp;#39;s in a bubble the</text>
  <text start="1034.449" dur="2.551">whole thing&amp;#39;s in a bubble and of course</text>
  <text start="1035.62" dur="3.12">you know the central bank&amp;#39;s all of a</text>
  <text start="1037" dur="3.12">sudden they can spot bubbles they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1038.74" dur="4.589">spot their own bubbles but they can spot</text>
  <text start="1040.12" dur="6.149">everyone else&amp;#39;s bubbles now what&amp;#39;s come</text>
  <text start="1043.329" dur="4.22">to light is that there is an individual</text>
  <text start="1046.269" dur="3.87">I&amp;#39;m going to try to pronounce his name</text>
  <text start="1047.549" dur="6.521">nobuaki Kobashi</text>
  <text start="1050.139" dur="5.821">and he is the bankruptcy trustee of</text>
  <text start="1054.07" dur="4.44">Mount GOx the largest Bitcoin exchange</text>
  <text start="1055.96" dur="4.38">in the world before hackers went in and</text>
  <text start="1058.51" dur="4.5">stole tens of thousands of customers</text>
  <text start="1060.34" dur="7.079">bitcoins worth billions at recent prices</text>
  <text start="1063.01" dur="7.379">and what was revealed was that he sold</text>
  <text start="1067.419" dur="7.411">off about 400 million in Bitcoin and</text>
  <text start="1070.389" dur="6.39">Bitcoin cash since late September and if</text>
  <text start="1074.83" dur="5.79">I remember correctly he has something</text>
  <text start="1076.779" dur="7.041">like 1 billion plus left to sell off now</text>
  <text start="1080.62" dur="8.1">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this is</text>
  <text start="1083.82" dur="7.63">the times that he was selling off and it</text>
  <text start="1088.72" dur="5.73">looks like it corresponds to when</text>
  <text start="1091.45" dur="7.14">Bitcoin dropped in price</text>
  <text start="1094.45" dur="8.189">when he sold 2,000 bitcoins Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="1098.59" dur="6.63">dropped 6,000 Bitcoin dropped and so on</text>
  <text start="1102.639" dur="4.65">and so forth and we can see and we</text>
  <text start="1105.22" dur="4.319">mentioned this before and Jeff Nielsen</text>
  <text start="1107.289" dur="6.211">actually mentioned this that yes the</text>
  <text start="1109.539" dur="7.02">central bankers if they have a huge</text>
  <text start="1113.5" dur="6.34">amount of cryptocurrencies to to</text>
  <text start="1116.559" dur="5.531">manipulate cryptocurrencies or to try to</text>
  <text start="1119.84" dur="4.98">populated they could sell it off and</text>
  <text start="1122.09" dur="5.64">actually this is proof that if you have</text>
  <text start="1124.82" dur="6.54">a lot of Bitcoin you can sell it off to</text>
  <text start="1127.73" dur="5.67">bring the price down doesn&amp;#39;t mean that</text>
  <text start="1131.36" dur="4.98">the price is going to stay down because</text>
  <text start="1133.4" dur="5.04">with an open and free market it should</text>
  <text start="1136.34" dur="4.319">shoot right back up which we&amp;#39;ve seen in</text>
  <text start="1138.44" dur="4.619">the past and it&amp;#39;s in the process of</text>
  <text start="1140.659" dur="4.26">moving up once again yes it comes down a</text>
  <text start="1143.059" dur="5.131">little bit but we can see that it moves</text>
  <text start="1144.919" dur="7.171">up and down but these huge drops in</text>
  <text start="1148.19" dur="7.5">prices was coming from this individual</text>
  <text start="1152.09" dur="6.36">that was selling the Bitcoin so we can</text>
  <text start="1155.69" dur="4.109">see right now this economy is in one</text>
  <text start="1158.45" dur="4.38">gigantic illusion</text>
  <text start="1159.799" dur="5.61">the bankers hate cryptocurrency Trump</text>
  <text start="1162.83" dur="5.579">the central bank there on either side</text>
  <text start="1165.409" dur="6.031">trying to gain the narrative of what is</text>
  <text start="1168.409" dur="6.24">going to happen in the economy and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1171.44" dur="5.07">headed towards a period of time where</text>
  <text start="1174.649" dur="5.731">we&amp;#39;re going to enter a transition and</text>
  <text start="1176.51" dur="8.19">whoever controls a narrative well that</text>
  <text start="1180.38" dur="7.26">will determine how hard this transition</text>
  <text start="1184.7" dur="4.68">is going to be will it be easier on the</text>
  <text start="1187.64" dur="2.88">people or very hard on the people very</text>
  <text start="1189.38" dur="3.6">hard on the people it would be the</text>
  <text start="1190.52" dur="5.55">central bankers a little bit easier will</text>
  <text start="1192.98" dur="5.61">be Trump bringing down the system and</text>
