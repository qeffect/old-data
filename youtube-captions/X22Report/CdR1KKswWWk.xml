  <text start="36.48" dur="6.84">now providing lethal aid to Ukraine</text>
  <text start="37.91" dur="7.12">major offensive soon to follow let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="43.32" dur="3.48">right into the economic collapse now we</text>
  <text start="45.03" dur="3.959">understand that Greece and the ECB</text>
  <text start="46.8" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re still in discussions actually</text>
  <text start="48.989" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;re in a holding pattern nothing has</text>
  <text start="50.64" dur="5.009">actually happened at this point but</text>
  <text start="53.399" dur="4.741">there is one thing happening the people</text>
  <text start="55.649" dur="4.89">in Greece the businesses in Greece</text>
  <text start="58.14" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re nervous they&amp;#39;re scared they</text>
  <text start="60.539" dur="4.65">don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going to happen and we</text>
  <text start="62.85" dur="5.339">see already that depositors they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="65.189" dur="5.61">taking their money out deposits have</text>
  <text start="68.189" dur="4.771">declined in the Greek banks by around</text>
  <text start="70.799" dur="5.401">seven point six billion euros in</text>

  <text start="78.479" dur="4.981">hundred and forty point five billion</text>
  <text start="81.299" dur="5.07">euros in February which is the lowest</text>
  <text start="83.46" dur="5.4">level in 10 years and I believe that</text>
  <text start="86.369" dur="4.411">these depositors are going to</text>
  <text start="88.86" dur="3.869">continually take out their money because</text>
  <text start="90.78" dur="4.229">again they don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="92.729" dur="4.051">happen and they don&amp;#39;t want to be cyprus</text>
  <text start="95.009" dur="3.93">and if you don&amp;#39;t know what cyprus does</text>
  <text start="96.78" dur="7.47">that is a balun this is what the site</text>
  <text start="98.939" dur="7.621">Cypriot people experienced back in 2013</text>
  <text start="104.25" dur="4.649">we&amp;#39;re all of a sudden they want to sleep</text>
  <text start="106.56" dur="5.55">they went to sleep on Friday they woke</text>
  <text start="108.899" dur="4.201">up on Saturday and the banks were closed</text>
  <text start="112.11" dur="3.299">they couldn&amp;#39;t get their money out</text>
  <text start="113.1" dur="3.9">capital controls were in effect and the</text>
  <text start="115.409" dur="3.121">government was out there telling them</text>
  <text start="117" dur="3.38">that yeah we&amp;#39;re going to take about</text>
  <text start="118.53" dur="4.17">eight to ten percent of your money and</text>
  <text start="120.38" dur="4.629">you won&amp;#39;t be able to take out your money</text>
  <text start="122.7" dur="3.84">or transfer it and what actually</text>
  <text start="125.009" dur="3.631">happened is they ended up taking about</text>
  <text start="126.54" dur="4.109">forty seven percent of their money and</text>
  <text start="128.64" dur="4.46">they were under capital controls for</text>
  <text start="130.649" dur="4.761">over a year and</text>
  <text start="133.1" dur="4.74">Greek people have seen this they know</text>
  <text start="135.41" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s a possibility and they are making</text>
  <text start="137.84" dur="5.43">sure that none of their money is in the</text>
  <text start="140.6" dur="5.37">banks and we know that these balint</text>
  <text start="143.27" dur="5.43">documents especially the one in the</text>
  <text start="145.97" dur="5.16">United States which was created with the</text>
  <text start="148.7" dur="6.86">help of the Bank of England and the</text>
  <text start="151.13" dur="8.01">United Kingdom that was created before</text>
  <text start="155.56" dur="5.62">the balance in Cyprus that one was</text>
  <text start="159.14" dur="6.87">created back in November December of</text>
  <text start="161.18" dur="7.05">2012 so they already were preparing for</text>
  <text start="166.01" dur="6">what was coming then all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="168.23" dur="6.63">eurozone New Zealand Switzerland Canada</text>
  <text start="172.01" dur="6.12">they all started taking on the bail-in</text>
  <text start="174.86" dur="4.59">document and we can see that all of</text>
  <text start="178.13" dur="3.78">these countries are ready because as</text>
  <text start="179.45" dur="4.44">they know and as we know when this</text>
  <text start="181.91" dur="3.75">collapse comes the governments are not</text>
  <text start="183.89" dur="4.59">going to bail them out they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="185.66" dur="5.64">have to look inward and take the money</text>
  <text start="188.48" dur="5.7">from the people because there is no</text>
  <text start="191.3" dur="7.14">money left anywhere and this is the only</text>
  <text start="194.18" dur="6.81">way they can keep these banks afloat now</text>
  <text start="198.44" dur="5.79">we see the Greek deputy finance minister</text>
  <text start="200.99" dur="5.52">he is ready and he is prepared for a</text>
  <text start="204.23" dur="4.5">rift with Europe he&amp;#39;s ready to go and</text>
  <text start="206.51" dur="4.53">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to wait to see how this</text>
  <text start="208.73" dur="4.95">all turns out to see if anything really</text>
  <text start="211.04" dur="5.04">comes about on this whole entire issue</text>
  <text start="213.68" dur="3.87">if things really go in the direction</text>
  <text start="216.08" dur="4.65">that we think it&amp;#39;s going to go and i do</text>
  <text start="217.55" dur="5.01">believe and I really think that Greece</text>
  <text start="220.73" dur="4.41">is looking to exit because they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="222.56" dur="3.99">visiting with Russia and there are</text>
  <text start="225.14" dur="3.54">certain signs like they&amp;#39;ve created a</text>
  <text start="226.55" dur="4.77">drachma and they know if they go to</text>
  <text start="228.68" dur="5.22">Russia that they will remove the food</text>
  <text start="231.32" dur="5.16">ban they will help with the economic</text>
  <text start="233.9" dur="5.91">situation they will not put them</text>
  <text start="236.48" dur="6.06">continuously into debt and asking them</text>
  <text start="239.81" dur="5.25">to impose austerity because again this</text>
  <text start="242.54" dur="4.68">is what the syriza party ran on and we</text>
  <text start="245.06" dur="3.48">can see that they&amp;#39;re leaning towards</text>
  <text start="247.22" dur="3.51">that direction but we&amp;#39;ll have to wait</text>
  <text start="248.54" dur="4.26">and see and watch what happens now out</text>
  <text start="250.73" dur="5.79">in London we see the number of people</text>
  <text start="252.8" dur="6.749">sleeping on the streets has risen by</text>
  <text start="256.52" dur="7.74">over one third in the past year twice</text>
  <text start="259.549" dur="6.851">the national average so why is all of</text>
  <text start="264.26" dur="7.71">this happening</text>
  <text start="266.4" dur="8.4">well it&amp;#39;s because the economic system is</text>
  <text start="271.97" dur="4.419">completely falling apart and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="274.8" dur="4.35">starting to see this in every single</text>
  <text start="276.389" dur="5.071">country where there are more and more</text>
  <text start="279.15" dur="5.04">homeless people they can&amp;#39;t pay for these</text>
  <text start="281.46" dur="5.13">expensive homes or pay for the expense</text>
  <text start="284.19" dur="4.8">of rent and a lot of these people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="286.59" dur="4.98">have the proper jobs in the proper</text>
  <text start="288.99" dur="3.989">income coming in data from the</text>
  <text start="291.57" dur="3.03">Department of Communities and Local</text>
  <text start="292.979" dur="3.901">Government found that levels of</text>
  <text start="294.6" dur="4.77">homelessness in the capital rose by</text>
  <text start="296.88" dur="5.22">thirty-seven percent between 2013 and</text>
  <text start="299.37" dur="4.89">2014 the rest of the country also rises</text>
  <text start="302.1" dur="3.72">on averaging about fourteen percent</text>
  <text start="304.26" dur="4.95">we&amp;#39;re seeing this here also in the</text>
  <text start="305.82" dur="4.83">United States those people who&amp;#39;ve lost</text>
  <text start="309.21" dur="4.59">their jobs who are only can find a</text>
  <text start="310.65" dur="5.489">part-time job they can&amp;#39;t support the way</text>
  <text start="313.8" dur="3.839">they used to live so if they were in a</text>
  <text start="316.139" dur="3.691">place where they were making a certain</text>
  <text start="317.639" dur="4.081">amount of money paying their rent their</text>
  <text start="319.83" dur="3.99">mortgage and they got something where</text>
  <text start="321.72" dur="3.569">they&amp;#39;re making less money they just</text>
  <text start="323.82" dur="4.23">can&amp;#39;t support it and eventually what</text>
  <text start="325.289" dur="5.31">happens is they either short sale they</text>
  <text start="328.05" dur="5.28">foreclose or they&amp;#39;re kicked out of their</text>
  <text start="330.599" dur="4.981">apartment and we see a lot more people</text>
  <text start="333.33" dur="5.13">sending up ten cities we see a lot more</text>
  <text start="335.58" dur="4.53">people on the streets and we can see</text>
  <text start="338.46" dur="3.66">that people are starting to wake up now</text>
  <text start="340.11" dur="5.94">and say something is definitely wrong</text>
  <text start="342.12" dur="7.109">with this economy I mean the humic ensue</text>
  <text start="346.05" dur="6.48">mer sentiment drop once again this is</text>
  <text start="349.229" dur="6.75">the second month in a row for the first</text>
  <text start="352.53" dur="4.83">time since October 2013 the Yuma</text>
  <text start="355.979" dur="5.071">consumer sentiment dropped four</text>
  <text start="357.36" dur="5.57">consecutive months it printed at 93 they</text>
  <text start="361.05" dur="5.82">thought they were going to get around</text>
  <text start="362.93" dur="6.09">95.4 but again it seems like all their</text>
  <text start="366.87" dur="6.18">estimates are always completely off</text>
  <text start="369.02" dur="5.56">going forward I mean of course they can</text>
  <text start="373.05" dur="3.42">manipulate everything but everything</text>
  <text start="374.58" dur="3.6">can&amp;#39;t be manipulated because when we</text>
  <text start="376.47" dur="3.629">look at what&amp;#39;s really going on we see</text>
  <text start="378.18" dur="4.169">that yeah the unemployment doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="380.099" dur="3.721">sense people are starting to realize</text>
  <text start="382.349" dur="3.091">that the unemployment doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="383.82" dur="3.69">people are coming out and speaking out</text>
  <text start="385.44" dur="4.8">that these statistical numbers don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="387.51" dur="4.409">make sense under the surface there are</text>
  <text start="390.24" dur="3.81">concerns with an increasing number of</text>
  <text start="391.919" dur="5.25">respondents noting that the household</text>
  <text start="394.05" dur="4.47">finance are worse than five years ago so</text>
  <text start="397.169" dur="3.151">people are starting to say wait a minute</text>
  <text start="398.52" dur="3.45">I lost my job I</text>
  <text start="400.32" dur="4.68">fine one I&amp;#39;m putting out a resume or I</text>
  <text start="401.97" dur="4.38">have a job and I would like a new one</text>
  <text start="405" dur="4.08">making more money I&amp;#39;m putting out my</text>
  <text start="406.35" dur="4.41">resume I can&amp;#39;t find that same job making</text>
  <text start="409.08" dur="4.2">the same amount of money forget about</text>
  <text start="410.76" dur="6">making more I can&amp;#39;t find the same job</text>
  <text start="413.28" dur="5.82">and we can see that this is starting to</text>
  <text start="416.76" dur="4.65">spread out where is this spreading well</text>
  <text start="419.1" dur="4.11">we see it in retail stores are closing</text>
  <text start="421.41" dur="4.2">people getting laid off we know that</text>
  <text start="423.21" dur="5.31">retail sales are way way down the</text>
  <text start="425.61" dur="5.7">holiday season was a complete bust and a</text>
  <text start="428.52" dur="6.03">lot more people are out there saying</text>
  <text start="431.31" dur="7.17">that this is a bad time to buy a house</text>
  <text start="434.55" dur="6.6">or a car and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="438.48" dur="5.61">government is trying to push anyone they</text>
  <text start="441.15" dur="6.69">possibly can into the housing market and</text>
  <text start="444.09" dur="6.3">into the automobile market and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="447.84" dur="4.85">accepting anyone that would like a house</text>
  <text start="450.39" dur="4.89">I don&amp;#39;t get no credit for closure</text>
  <text start="452.69" dur="4.66">bankrupt makes note you have no job</text>
  <text start="455.28" dur="5.46">makes no difference you can buy a house</text>
  <text start="457.35" dur="5.07">oh you don&amp;#39;t even need money down will</text>
  <text start="460.74" dur="3.57">even cover the closing costs some of</text>
  <text start="462.42" dur="4.59">these banks are saying and builders are</text>
  <text start="464.31" dur="4.35">making up the difference they just want</text>
  <text start="467.01" dur="5.07">to keep the system going and this is why</text>
  <text start="468.66" dur="5.28">they create these new programs yes a lot</text>
  <text start="472.08" dur="3.27">of people look at it and say ah this is</text>
  <text start="473.94" dur="4.95">my chance to purchase and this is what</text>
  <text start="475.35" dur="5.58">happened back in 2007-2008 and they went</text>
  <text start="478.89" dur="4.02">ahead and they purchased the house a lot</text>
  <text start="480.93" dur="5.31">of them used the adjustable rate</text>
  <text start="482.91" dur="6.42">mortgage programs where they were only</text>
  <text start="486.24" dur="5.73">paying the interest and not the</text>
  <text start="489.33" dur="4.74">principal at a very low interest rate</text>
  <text start="491.97" dur="4.05">and then all of a sudden things started</text>
  <text start="494.07" dur="4.17">to change and the interest rate started</text>
  <text start="496.02" dur="3.84">to tick up and this caused many many</text>
  <text start="498.24" dur="4.65">problems and then all of a sudden people</text>
  <text start="499.86" dur="6.6">started losing jobs the same things</text>
  <text start="502.89" dur="6.48">going to occur once again we&amp;#39;re not out</text>
  <text start="506.46" dur="5.52">of the woods actually at this point in</text>
  <text start="509.37" dur="3.99">time things are much much worse because</text>
  <text start="511.98" dur="5.16">what the government has been doing is</text>
  <text start="513.36" dur="6.33">they&amp;#39;ve been going with these</text>
  <text start="517.14" dur="4.709">statistical numbers and changing them to</text>
  <text start="519.69" dur="4.77">make you believe that we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="521.849" dur="5.781">recovery so right now the economy is</text>
  <text start="524.46" dur="7.35">much much much much worse than it was</text>
  <text start="527.63" dur="4.96">prior to two thousand eight and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="531.81" dur="4.92">headed</text>
  <text start="532.59" dur="7.25">towards a major collapse scenario and we</text>
  <text start="536.73" dur="6.93">can see by unemployment GDP inflation</text>
  <text start="539.84" dur="7.15">they&amp;#39;re continually manipulating all of</text>
  <text start="543.66" dur="8.63">these numbers and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="546.99" dur="9.48">fourth quarter GDP is unchanged at 2.2%</text>
  <text start="552.29" dur="7.75">way below the expectations and then we</text>
  <text start="556.47" dur="6.84">take a closer look at what has really</text>
  <text start="560.04" dur="5.61">made up the gdp in 2014 the fourth</text>
  <text start="563.31" dur="5.31">quarter the third quarter and when we</text>
  <text start="565.65" dur="6.57">look closer at it we see it was</text>
  <text start="568.62" dur="6">Obamacare this is where people were</text>
  <text start="572.22" dur="5.4">spending their money Obamacare was</text>
  <text start="574.62" dur="8.67">included in the GDP numbers to boost</text>
  <text start="577.62" dur="9.09">them up in q3 gdp some were shocked to</text>
  <text start="583.29" dur="5.28">learn that the u.s. GDB posted a five</text>
  <text start="586.71" dur="5.88">percent surge and that was due to</text>
  <text start="588.57" dur="7.17">obamacare and now in the fourth quarter</text>
  <text start="592.59" dur="6.36">guess what history has just repeated</text>
  <text start="595.74" dur="6.6">itself nothing has changed whatsoever</text>
  <text start="598.95" dur="5.7">all those people that were saving money</text>
  <text start="602.34" dur="4.98">because the gas prices came down it all</text>
  <text start="604.65" dur="8.15">went to health care so does it sound</text>
  <text start="607.32" dur="5.48">like we have a robust economy if</text>
  <text start="613.31" dur="7.74">Obamacare was the biggest contributor to</text>
  <text start="617.37" dur="6.84">the GDP numbers I mean if we remove</text>
  <text start="621.05" dur="5.5">Obamacare the GDP numbers would be low</text>
  <text start="624.21" dur="5.01">would be way way down are probably in</text>
  <text start="626.55" dur="6.54">the negative area but they included it</text>
  <text start="629.22" dur="5.25">why to convince everyone that we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="633.09" dur="4.47">recovery and I hate to say it health</text>
  <text start="634.47" dur="4.86">care doesn&amp;#39;t show that the economy is</text>
  <text start="637.56" dur="5.91">improving it shows that people are</text>
  <text start="639.33" dur="8.25">spending money for air nothing because</text>
  <text start="643.47" dur="6.12">with Obamacare the deductibles are very</text>
  <text start="647.58" dur="4.11">high so you can be paying five six seven</text>
  <text start="649.59" dur="4.35">hundred dollars every single month and</text>
  <text start="651.69" dur="4.74">then you go to the doctor and you expect</text>
  <text start="653.94" dur="5.88">Obamacare to pay for that doctor&amp;#39;s visit</text>
  <text start="656.43" dur="6.39">know you have a deductible of two three</text>
  <text start="659.82" dur="4.95">four five thousand dollars and you have</text>
  <text start="662.82" dur="3.17">to pay out of pocket until you reach</text>
  <text start="664.77" dur="3.989">that number</text>
  <text start="665.99" dur="5.589">so this is definitely not a benefit to</text>
  <text start="668.759" dur="4.531">the people whatsoever and if we look at</text>
  <text start="671.579" dur="3.781">this we see that Obamacare was the</text>

  <text start="693.81" dur="5.49">tells us this economy is dead in the</text>

  <text start="2368.91" dur="6.93">nuclear weapons on Crimea to protect</text>
  <text start="2371.78" dur="7.78">Russia because we can see that they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="2385.53" dur="6.75">want is the southeastern portion of</text>
  <text start="2387.69" dur="8.58">Ukraine and Crimea we see they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2392.28" dur="8.01">parading a convoy of military equipment</text>

  <text start="2407.55" dur="6.09">at all the weapons we are ready you are</text>
  <text start="2410.13" dur="7.49">protected and as we know they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="2413.64" dur="9.3">military drills on going in all of these</text>
  <text start="2417.62" dur="7.6">countries now out in Israel Israel</text>
  <text start="2422.94" dur="5.13">continually says that they do not have</text>
  <text start="2425.22" dur="7.43">any nuclear weapons whatsoever and there</text>
  <text start="2428.07" dur="7.86">was a report which was Declassified</text>
  <text start="2432.65" dur="6.13">detailing Israel&amp;#39;s nuclear program the</text>
  <text start="2435.93" dur="4.92">US government has chosen to declassify a</text>
  <text start="2438.78" dur="4.5">top-secret document that pulls the lid</text>
  <text start="2440.85" dur="6.54">off of Israel&amp;#39;s nuclear weapons program</text>
  <text start="2443.28" dur="6.9">and according to this document which was</text>
  <text start="2447.39" dur="4.44">written in 1987 was released in early</text>
  <text start="2450.18" dur="4.41">februari it is believed to be the first</text>
  <text start="2451.83" dur="6.27">time the US has publicly acknowledged</text>
  <text start="2454.59" dur="5.04">Israel has nuclear arms the 386 page</text>
  <text start="2458.1" dur="3.93">document provides a detailed breakdown</text>
  <text start="2459.63" dur="5.04">of how Israel developed nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="2462.03" dur="5.13">in the 70s and 80s Israel is developing</text>
  <text start="2464.67" dur="4.83">the kind of codes which will enable them</text>
  <text start="2467.16" dur="6.18">to make hydrogen bombs so basically they</text>
  <text start="2469.5" dur="7.29">already have it right now so we can see</text>
  <text start="2473.34" dur="8.01">right now they have nuclear weapons and</text>
  <text start="2476.79" dur="8.91">there is a problem with this because</text>
  <text start="2481.35" dur="6.33">when we look at this we see that they</text>
  <text start="2485.7" dur="4.59">have nuclear weapons they don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="2487.68" dur="4.97">IAEA inspections and they have not</text>
  <text start="2490.29" dur="5.58">signed the non-proliferation treaty and</text>
  <text start="2492.65" dur="6.13">if you notice everything that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2495.87" dur="6.18">been talking about how Iran is keeping</text>
  <text start="2498.78" dur="5.07">and I mean keeping their nuclear project</text>
  <text start="2502.05" dur="4.29">their nuclear weapon project a secret</text>
  <text start="2503.85" dur="4.68">and they&amp;#39;re making nuclear weapons well</text>
  <text start="2506.34" dur="5.49">basically it&amp;#39;s the opposite this is what</text>
  <text start="2508.53" dur="6.9">Israel has been doing and because of</text>
  <text start="2511.83" dur="5.25">this under the foreign assistance act of</text>

  <text start="2605.03" dur="8.46">now out in Yemen as we said yesterday it</text>
  <text start="2609.45" dur="6.45">is a double standard right now because</text>
  <text start="2613.49" dur="4.42">Saudi Arabia which is controlled by the</text>

  <text start="2631.29" dur="3.78">democracy to overthrow the government</text>
  <text start="2632.79" dur="7.43">there well the reason for this is</text>
  <text start="2635.07" dur="7.74">because in Ukraine they wanted to remove</text>
  <text start="2640.22" dur="6.28">the government there and place their</text>
