  <text start="130.209" dur="4.711">threw his hat into the arena he even</text>
  <text start="132.91" dur="5.1">said this whole impeachment thing has</text>
  <text start="134.92" dur="4.89">completely backfired and it&amp;#39;s not having</text>
  <text start="138.01" dur="4.71">the effect that they all thought it was</text>
  <text start="139.81" dur="5.64">going to have now of course there&amp;#39;s many</text>
  <text start="142.72" dur="6.96">different agendas within this entire</text>
  <text start="145.45" dur="6.84">fake impeachment push because we have</text>
  <text start="149.68" dur="4.02">different levels of corruption certain</text>
  <text start="152.29" dur="3.9">individuals are looking out for</text>
  <text start="153.7" dur="4.98">themselves and then we have the major</text>
  <text start="156.19" dur="4.98">major players the deep state players and</text>
  <text start="158.68" dur="4.74">I&amp;#39;m not talking about Maxine Waters I do</text>
  <text start="161.17" dur="5.52">believe those are low-level</text>
  <text start="163.42" dur="5.91">corrupt individuals I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="166.69" dur="7.11">the higher level that were pushing and</text>
  <text start="169.33" dur="7.95">directing a complete agenda to destroy</text>
  <text start="173.8" dur="7.05">the United States and this is what the</text>
  <text start="177.28" dur="5.85">Patriots are stopping now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="180.85" dur="6.14">interesting is that Bloomberg he threw</text>
  <text start="183.13" dur="6.62">his hat into the presidential ring and</text>
  <text start="186.99" dur="6.999">his news organization Bloomberg</text>
  <text start="189.75" dur="7.84">announced it won&amp;#39;t investigate Michael</text>
  <text start="193.989" dur="7.5">Bloomberg but they&amp;#39;ll still investigate</text>
  <text start="197.59" dur="7.53">and still report on Trump now a former</text>
  <text start="201.489" dur="6.451">FEC member said that the outlets</text>
  <text start="205.12" dur="6.27">editorial policy raises serious campaign</text>
  <text start="207.94" dur="5.16">finance concerns if they&amp;#39;re not willing</text>
  <text start="211.39" dur="5.34">to do any negative stories that might</text>
  <text start="213.1" dur="6.66">come up about Mike whereas they are</text>
  <text start="216.73" dur="7.289">about Trump then they&amp;#39;re directly</text>
  <text start="219.76" dur="7.229">helping his campaign and this violates</text>
  <text start="224.019" dur="5.071">their rules and we&amp;#39;ll have to see how</text>
  <text start="226.989" dur="6.421">this all plays out now we know the fake</text>
  <text start="229.09" dur="6.119">impeachment it is falling apart and many</text>
  <text start="233.41" dur="4.62">of the Republicans were saying you know</text>
  <text start="235.209" dur="6.421">something we had a lot of closed-door</text>
  <text start="238.03" dur="7.44">secret meetings we have the testimony of</text>
  <text start="241.63" dur="5.73">certain individuals but Schiff Pelosi</text>
  <text start="245.47" dur="3">they were holding them back they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="247.36" dur="4.71">want them out there because it would</text>
  <text start="248.47" dur="5.16">ruin their public hearings and we know</text>
  <text start="252.07" dur="4.979">that Lee Zeldin was out there saying</text>
  <text start="253.63" dur="6.5">this and many others moat seems we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="257.049" dur="5.971">gotten the transcript of Mark&amp;#39;s Andy and</text>
  <text start="260.13" dur="6.58">his closed-door deposition sheds light</text>
  <text start="263.02" dur="7.35">on why the foreign aid was being held</text>
  <text start="266.71" dur="6.75">back and it wasn&amp;#39;t four quid whoa quid</text>
  <text start="270.37" dur="5.64">pro quo it wasn&amp;#39;t for a bribe it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="273.46" dur="5.1">for anything that they were trying to</text>
  <text start="276.01" dur="4.279">convince the American people of and as</text>
  <text start="278.56" dur="4.169">we can see from the fake and patron</text>
  <text start="280.289" dur="5.681">nobody had any evidence of anything</text>
  <text start="282.729" dur="5.19">anyhow so mark sandy testified that</text>
  <text start="285.97" dur="4.38">Trump began asking questions about the</text>
  <text start="287.919" dur="4.321">eight On June 19th he learned about the</text>
  <text start="290.35" dur="5.1">president&amp;#39;s decision to withhold the aid</text>
  <text start="292.24" dur="5.1">on July 18th when he returned from leave</text>
  <text start="295.45" dur="4.32">he sought advice from the om</text>
  <text start="297.34" dur="4.95">be counseled because the terms of the</text>
  <text start="299.77" dur="5.25">impoundment Control Act set a limit to</text>
  <text start="302.29" dur="5.28">how long funds could be held when he</text>
  <text start="305.02" dur="5.01">asked for the reason for the hold his</text>
  <text start="307.57" dur="4.5">supervisor did not know nor did anyone</text>
  <text start="310.03" dur="4.949">else finally he said there was an email</text>
  <text start="312.07" dur="5.879">in early September that explained the</text>
  <text start="314.979" dur="5.131">reasoning I recall in early September an</text>
  <text start="317.949" dur="4.201">email that attributed the hole to the</text>
  <text start="320.11" dur="4.77">president&amp;#39;s concern about other</text>
  <text start="322.15" dur="3.86">countries not contributing more to</text>
  <text start="324.88" dur="3.99">Ukraine</text>
  <text start="326.01" dur="5.29">sandy testified that another official</text>
  <text start="328.87" dur="5.519">took over the approval process for the</text>
  <text start="331.3" dur="5.13">appointments on July 30th the Dems tried</text>
  <text start="334.389" dur="5.521">to repeatedly to probe for evidence of</text>
  <text start="336.43" dur="6.12">why this decision was made and was it</text>
  <text start="339.91" dur="5.34">related to Ukraine and Mark Zandi said</text>
  <text start="342.55" dur="4.47">no had nothing to do with Ukraine the</text>
  <text start="345.25" dur="4.65">mainstream media like the Washington</text>
  <text start="347.02" dur="5.64">Post and many others led with the story</text>
  <text start="349.9" dur="5.43">that sandy testified that to OMB</text>
  <text start="352.66" dur="6.12">officials had resigned over the hold on</text>
  <text start="355.33" dur="5.22">Ukraine a but sandy testified that one</text>
  <text start="358.78" dur="4.05">resigned because of frustrations about</text>
  <text start="360.55" dur="4.8">not understanding the reason for the</text>
  <text start="362.83" dur="7.11">hold and that the other resign because</text>
  <text start="365.35" dur="6.39">of concerns about actions visa vie the</text>
  <text start="369.94" dur="3.9">impoundment Control Act</text>
  <text start="371.74" dur="4.679">neither resigned because of reasons</text>
  <text start="373.84" dur="3.71">specific to the president&amp;#39;s approach to</text>
  <text start="376.419" dur="6.271">Ukraine</text>
  <text start="377.55" dur="7.06">once again this completely clears Trump</text>
  <text start="382.69" dur="4.229">now why didn&amp;#39;t they release this</text>
  <text start="384.61" dur="6.15">transcript or why didn&amp;#39;t they have mark</text>
  <text start="386.919" dur="7.021">sandy testify in these public hearings</text>
  <text start="390.76" dur="4.86">because he would have said this and it</text>
  <text start="393.94" dur="4.17">would have blown everyone out of the</text>
  <text start="395.62" dur="5.07">water because all of them saying I</text>
  <text start="398.11" dur="3.809">assume this is what I believed the two</text>
  <text start="400.69" dur="3.96">plus two equals four</text>
  <text start="401.919" dur="4.381">that makes sense that would have been</text>
  <text start="404.65" dur="4.68">completely wiped it would have been</text>
  <text start="406.3" dur="6.48">countered and they would have no</text>
  <text start="409.33" dur="6.18">hearings because why have anyone else he</text>
  <text start="412.78" dur="4.68">already explained that it was because he</text>
  <text start="415.51" dur="3.45">wanted to see how much other people were</text>
  <text start="417.46" dur="3.329">paying I mean other countries how much</text>
  <text start="418.96" dur="5.76">they were paying and why weren&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="420.789" dur="5.37">paying a lot more and even if he wanted</text>
  <text start="424.72" dur="3.99">to look into Ukraine to see if there was</text>
  <text start="426.159" dur="4.101">corruption he has the right to do that</text>
  <text start="428.71" dur="8.25">which he did</text>
  <text start="430.26" dur="11.56">now we know the fake impeachment cannot</text>
  <text start="436.96" dur="7.38">move ahead without the three cases now</text>
  <text start="441.82" dur="8.22">yesterday we talked about how this judge</text>
  <text start="444.34" dur="7.17">said yes McGann has to testify and of</text>
  <text start="450.04" dur="4.379">course Schiff and Heather were walking</text>
  <text start="451.51" dur="6.87">around like yes we got it he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="454.419" dur="6.271">testify now all of a sudden the judge</text>
  <text start="458.38" dur="6.21">has granted a temporary hold this is the</text>
  <text start="460.69" dur="7.53">same exact judge judge Kent on G Brown</text>
  <text start="464.59" dur="6.03">Jackson said she will allow a brief stay</text>
  <text start="468.22" dur="4.38">to consider whether her previous ruling</text>
  <text start="470.62" dur="4.47">should be kept on hold as the Justice</text>
  <text start="472.6" dur="4.77">Department appeals the decision and like</text>
  <text start="475.09" dur="6.18">we said we knew the Justice Department</text>
  <text start="477.37" dur="6.5">was going to appeal so right now just</text>
  <text start="481.27" dur="6.8">like the taxes they have nothing and</text>
  <text start="483.87" dur="6.13">they know they&amp;#39;re not gonna get anything</text>
  <text start="488.07" dur="3.28">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="490" dur="3.47">going to go to the Supreme Court which</text>
  <text start="491.35" dur="5.93">these cases are in the Supreme Court and</text>
  <text start="493.47" dur="8.35">the Supreme Court is going to rule that</text>
  <text start="497.28" dur="10.509">yeah you can&amp;#39;t have any of this and once</text>
  <text start="501.82" dur="9.15">they do this it all falls apart now the</text>
  <text start="507.789" dur="7.401">house they might not even vote on</text>
  <text start="510.97" dur="8.309">impeachment they will most likely</text>
  <text start="515.19" dur="8.1">censure Trump now this is their escape</text>
  <text start="519.279" dur="7.801">clause because under House Resolution</text>
  <text start="523.29" dur="6.669">661 AO preparing a report summarizing</text>
  <text start="527.08" dur="5.009">the evidence that they found which is</text>
  <text start="529.959" dur="3.601">really no evidence this will be</text>
  <text start="532.089" dur="3.481">transmitted to the Judiciary Committee</text>
  <text start="533.56" dur="5.49">soon after Congress returns from</text>
  <text start="535.57" dur="4.92">Thanksgiving now chairman Nadler and the</text>
  <text start="539.05" dur="3.72">members and staff of the Judiciary</text>
  <text start="540.49" dur="5.219">Committee will proceed in the next phase</text>
  <text start="542.77" dur="5.49">of the impeachment inquiry so if the</text>
  <text start="545.709" dur="5.491">house votes down impeachment Trump wins</text>
  <text start="548.26" dur="6.69">if the house holds no vote on the issue</text>
  <text start="551.2" dur="5.67">Trump wins if the house votes for</text>
  <text start="554.95" dur="4.139">censure and we&amp;#39;re starting to hear that</text>
  <text start="556.87" dur="5.219">word quite a bit now so if the house</text>
  <text start="559.089" dur="4.421">votes for censure Trump will have won on</text>
  <text start="562.089" dur="4.12">points and the issue</text>
  <text start="563.51" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;ll be over if the House votes for</text>
  <text start="566.209" dur="5.041">impeachment the case goes to the Senate</text>
  <text start="568.19" dur="4.92">for a trial now the Republican senators</text>
  <text start="571.25" dur="3.81">would immediately call up a number of</text>
  <text start="573.11" dur="5.7">people for questioning these would</text>
  <text start="575.06" dur="6.209">include Joe Biden hunter Biden his</text>
  <text start="578.81" dur="4.649">business partner Devin Archer John Kerry</text>

  <text start="588.38" dur="4.56">call in the whistleblower it would also</text>
  <text start="590.93" dur="3.99">be of interest to hear how deep the</text>
  <text start="592.94" dur="5.25">former CIA director John Brennan was</text>
  <text start="594.92" dur="5.25">involved in the issue the senators can</text>
  <text start="598.19" dur="5.16">use the impeachment trial to dig into</text>
  <text start="600.17" dur="6.09">all the crimes the Dems under Obama</text>
  <text start="603.35" dur="5.729">committed in Ukraine they would</text>
  <text start="606.26" dur="5.55">concentrate not only on the Maidan coup</text>
  <text start="609.079" dur="6.021">but on the aftermath when the deals were</text>
  <text start="611.81" dur="7.26">made there surely is a lot of dirt and</text>
  <text start="615.1" dur="7.989">it is not only Joe Biden what happens if</text>
  <text start="619.07" dur="7.85">it&amp;#39;s going to expose the entire system</text>

  <text start="1370.22" dur="6.45">had to do with Obama Eric Holder they</text>
  <text start="1373.549" dur="5.791">were taking weapons and they were</text>
  <text start="1376.67" dur="6.18">putting these weapons in the hands of</text>
  <text start="1379.34" dur="5.9">criminals south of the border and it was</text>
  <text start="1382.85" dur="6.9">thousands upon thousands of weapons and</text>
  <text start="1385.24" dur="8.02">these weapons were used to kill many</text>
  <text start="1389.75" dur="5.88">many people why do you think Trump is</text>
  <text start="1393.26" dur="5.49">doing this he&amp;#39;s starting the</text>
  <text start="1395.63" dur="6.03">investigations to understand or let the</text>
  <text start="1398.75" dur="5.04">American people understand what was</text>
  <text start="1401.66" dur="4.889">really going on what these operations</text>

  <text start="1416" dur="4.2">come into the United States and bring</text>
  <text start="1418.22" dur="6.06">the drugs here remember the war on drugs</text>
  <text start="1420.2" dur="7.8">is not about stopping all drug running</text>
  <text start="1424.28" dur="8.99">it&amp;#39;s about stopping the competition for</text>
  <text start="1428" dur="9.53">the CIA so the CIA is the sole</text>
  <text start="1433.27" dur="6.88">organization that pushes the drugs</text>
  <text start="1437.53" dur="5.23">that&amp;#39;s what the war on drugs is all</text>
  <text start="1440.15" dur="6.269">about and this is why Trump is putting</text>
  <text start="1442.76" dur="7.62">up a wall he&amp;#39;s closing down all of these</text>
  <text start="1446.419" dur="5.521">operations now very interestingly we</text>

  <text start="1466.91" dur="5.61">you eat turkey on Thanksgiving but</text>
  <text start="1470.299" dur="6.51">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is the names of</text>
  <text start="1472.52" dur="6.84">the turkeys bread and butter and this is</text>
  <text start="1476.809" dur="5.701">coming from stormy Patriot Joe</text>

  <text start="1482.51" dur="6.419">message for butter the turkey for got</text>
  <text start="1485.36" dur="6.84">pardoned my thought is Assange will be</text>
  <text start="1488.929" dur="6.051">eventually pardoned found a few articles</text>
  <text start="1492.2" dur="6.52">with Assange and butter in them</text>
  <text start="1494.98" dur="7.14">and Trump says he named butter and</text>
  <text start="1498.72" dur="6.85">there&amp;#39;s also bread and he pardoned one</text>
  <text start="1502.12" dur="8.19">of the turkeys stormy Patriot Joe</text>
  <text start="1505.57" dur="7.44">continued ah I think this has legs the</text>
  <text start="1510.31" dur="4.89">other turkey was named bread so bread</text>
  <text start="1513.01" dur="5.19">and butter both were in these articles</text>
  <text start="1515.2" dur="6.3">about Julian Assange so let&amp;#39;s take a</text>
  <text start="1518.2" dur="5.36">look at this for a sec this is the first</text>
  <text start="1521.5" dur="6.14">article where it says Julian Assange</text>
  <text start="1523.56" dur="7.21">roommate from hell we both like raw meat</text>
  <text start="1527.64" dur="5.23">steak tartare with onions the fact that</text>
  <text start="1530.77" dur="4.77">I took longer to eat my share was</text>
  <text start="1532.87" dur="3.93">because I ate it with whole-grain bread</text>
  <text start="1535.54" dur="4.11">and butter</text>
  <text start="1536.8" dur="5.13">now the other article is an attempt</text>
  <text start="1539.65" dur="4.1">password crack was enough for a u.s.</text>
  <text start="1541.93" dur="5.16">indictment against Julian Assange and</text>
  <text start="1543.75" dur="5.65">this reads as follows this is very</text>
  <text start="1547.09" dur="4.26">simply that Chelsea Manning had a</text>
  <text start="1549.4" dur="4.44">certain level of access because of a</text>
  <text start="1551.35" dur="5.82">clearance Manning was giving information</text>
  <text start="1553.84" dur="5.49">already Manning and Assange made an</text>
  <text start="1557.17" dur="4.8">agreement to get more information he</text>
  <text start="1559.33" dur="6.18">said to do that they had to break the</text>
  <text start="1561.97" dur="9.06">password and that&amp;#39;s the bread and butter</text>
  <text start="1565.51" dur="8.16">of the CFAA so both of these articles</text>
  <text start="1571.03" dur="5.28">mentioned bread or butter one of them</text>
  <text start="1573.67" dur="4.98">mentions bread and butter and I do</text>
  <text start="1576.31" dur="5.13">believe that Trump is making a reference</text>
  <text start="1578.65" dur="5.36">to Julian Assange letting everyone know</text>
  <text start="1581.44" dur="6.75">that he is going to be pardoned and</text>
  <text start="1584.01" dur="5.56">remember he is the key and I do believe</text>
  <text start="1588.19" dur="3.36">he&amp;#39;s gonna be extradited back here to</text>
  <text start="1589.57" dur="5.03">the United States and he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1591.55" dur="6.09">present the evidence how do we know this</text>
  <text start="1594.6" dur="9.22">well today Trump tweeted out a picture</text>
  <text start="1597.64" dur="8.99">of his head on Rocky&amp;#39;s body now we need</text>
  <text start="1603.82" dur="5.4">to remember that rocky made many</text>
  <text start="1606.63" dur="5.17">different Rocky movies there was rocky</text>
  <text start="1609.22" dur="4.14">one there was two three four I think</text>
  <text start="1611.8" dur="5.04">there was five and maybe even more than</text>
  <text start="1613.36" dur="5.85">that I lost count but this particular</text>
  <text start="1616.84" dur="6.24">movie when he was fighting Drago this</text>
  <text start="1619.21" dur="6.3">was in Russia rocky had to fly out to</text>
  <text start="1623.08" dur="4.25">Russia because he lost the initial fight</text>
  <text start="1625.51" dur="4.31">to Drago</text>
  <text start="1627.33" dur="6.33">and he flew out there and he trained out</text>
  <text start="1629.82" dur="6.09">in Russia and if you remember and if you</text>
  <text start="1633.66" dur="4.64">remember the fight in the movie rocky</text>
  <text start="1635.91" dur="6.48">allowed Drago to throw all the punches</text>
  <text start="1638.3" dur="8.58">Rocky sat back and took each punch by</text>
  <text start="1642.39" dur="7.41">defending his body Drago started to tire</text>
  <text start="1646.88" dur="5.89">it seemed like he had the upper hand he</text>
  <text start="1649.8" dur="6.51">was beating Rocky he was a lot taller</text>
  <text start="1652.77" dur="7.2">than him he was much more muscular and</text>
  <text start="1656.31" dur="6.96">he towered over rocky and his punches</text>
  <text start="1659.97" dur="6.63">were very very hard he hit rocky really</text>
  <text start="1663.27" dur="7.2">hard but rocky put up his hands and he</text>
  <text start="1666.6" dur="7.22">protected his body he got hit and after</text>
  <text start="1670.47" dur="6.51">while this big guy started to tire out</text>
  <text start="1673.82" dur="6.16">he couldn&amp;#39;t throw any more punches the</text>
  <text start="1676.98" dur="6.84">punches they were coming but the impact</text>
  <text start="1679.98" dur="8.94">it just wasn&amp;#39;t there and on this day</text>
  <text start="1683.82" dur="8.52">November 27th 1985 this is when the</text>
  <text start="1688.92" dur="9.98">movie was released Trump tweeted out</text>
  <text start="1692.34" dur="11.04">this picture on November 27th 2019 why</text>
  <text start="1698.9" dur="9.01">because rocky knocked out Drago in the</text>
  <text start="1703.38" dur="8.81">15th round remember Trump is a counter</text>
  <text start="1707.91" dur="7.94">puncher like Rocky he doesn&amp;#39;t hit first</text>
  <text start="1712.19" dur="6.37">but when he fights back the punch is</text>
  <text start="1715.85" dur="6.7">powerful it&amp;#39;s harder than anything</text>
  <text start="1718.56" dur="7.23">before and if you really compare this to</text>
  <text start="1722.55" dur="6.09">the deep state the deep state was large</text>
  <text start="1725.79" dur="6.09">wasn&amp;#39;t it the swamp was gigantic it was</text>
  <text start="1728.64" dur="6.45">wide it was deep they had all the power</text>
  <text start="1731.88" dur="6.42">and in the beginning their punches were</text>
  <text start="1735.09" dur="5.61">very very hard they hit Trump very hard</text>
  <text start="1738.3" dur="7.11">they had the Russian collusion but as</text>
  <text start="1740.7" dur="7.94">time went on the punches the events were</text>
  <text start="1745.41" dur="6.07">not that hard they were getting tired</text>
  <text start="1748.64" dur="5.81">they were weakening</text>
  <text start="1751.48" dur="7.559">and over time they continued to weaken</text>
  <text start="1754.45" dur="7.65">just like Drago and here we are Trump</text>
  <text start="1759.039" dur="7.441">put this picture out there to let us all</text>
