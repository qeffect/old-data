  <text start="76.2" dur="4.709">are really falling apart I mean it is a</text>
  <text start="78.21" dur="4.65">complete disaster in Greece of course</text>
  <text start="80.909" dur="4.35">the central bankers they think this is</text>
  <text start="82.86" dur="4.399">amazing but we know the stock market</text>
  <text start="85.259" dur="5.79">opened and we see that Greek bank stocks</text>
  <text start="87.259" dur="7.42">completely crashed I mean there are</text>
  <text start="91.049" dur="6.21">signs of economic disintegration all</text>

  <text start="114.99" dur="4.649">deal of the central bankers say they</text>
  <text start="117.45" dur="6.119">expect the bailout deal to be done by</text>

  <text start="123.569" dur="4.771">is not going to help the people</text>
  <text start="125.069" dur="6.331">whatsoever and what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="128.34" dur="5.369">is that the people of Greece they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="131.4" dur="3.75">very upset first of all the referendum</text>
  <text start="133.709" dur="3.841">was absolutely meaningless the</text>
  <text start="135.15" dur="5.419">government didn&amp;#39;t listen to them second</text>
  <text start="137.55" dur="6.33">of all austerities being imposed on them</text>
  <text start="140.569" dur="6.841">this does not help the economy does not</text>
  <text start="143.88" dur="8.37">help the people with food rent income</text>
  <text start="147.41" dur="7.84">jobs medical supplies it does nothing</text>
  <text start="152.25" dur="5.819">for them basically there&amp;#39;s one Greek</text>
  <text start="155.25" dur="6.87">person out there as many of them but one</text>
  <text start="158.069" dur="6.361">of them has said I just don&amp;#39;t care it</text>
  <text start="162.12" dur="5.729">doesn&amp;#39;t affect my life not even a time</text>
  <text start="164.43" dur="6.6">little bit I give neither a whole damn</text>
  <text start="167.849" dur="6.411">nor half of it for this so-called Greek</text>
  <text start="171.03" dur="5.28">political agenda after July thirteenth</text>
  <text start="174.26" dur="3.94">he doesn&amp;#39;t care about what the</text>
  <text start="176.31" dur="4.89">government is doing right now he says</text>
  <text start="178.2" dur="5.55">what I do care about is to watch my</text>
  <text start="181.2" dur="5.369">country and the people falling into</text>
  <text start="183.75" dur="4.519">pieces I see our Greek life suffering</text>
  <text start="186.569" dur="4.28">another internal devaluation</text>
  <text start="188.269" dur="5.8">minute-by-minute day-by-day week-by-week</text>
  <text start="190.849" dur="5.89">others played by long-term unemployment</text>
  <text start="194.069" dur="5.01">and no perspective to get a job or even</text>
  <text start="196.739" dur="5.131">a pension felt obliged to sell their</text>
  <text start="199.079" dur="5.731">home that&amp;#39;s not possible under capital</text>
  <text start="201.87" dur="6">controls the selling amount will remain</text>
  <text start="204.81" dur="6.629">in the bank and it may even fall victim</text>
  <text start="207.87" dur="5.489">to deposit haircut by the end of the</text>
  <text start="211.439" dur="4.53">year another friend who needs to sell</text>
  <text start="213.359" dur="4.651">her second flat and inheritance so that</text>
  <text start="215.969" dur="3.39">she has money to live cannot sell it</text>
  <text start="218.01" dur="2.61">either because when they sell it the</text>
  <text start="219.359" dur="4.891">money goes into the bank and guess what</text>
  <text start="220.62" dur="6.06">they cannot access it this is the</text>
  <text start="224.25" dur="7.199">problem with capital controls you cannot</text>
  <text start="226.68" dur="7.139">live you cannot access your money he</text>
  <text start="231.449" dur="4.65">said with the new value-added tax hikes</text>
  <text start="233.819" dur="4.95">the amount we need to spend for our</text>
  <text start="236.099" dur="6.48">weekly basic groceries now extra now our</text>
  <text start="238.769" dur="5.46">extra 15 to 20 euros just 15 euros it</text>
  <text start="242.579" dur="4.951">doesn&amp;#39;t sound like a much doesn&amp;#39;t sound</text>
  <text start="244.229" dur="5.82">like that much but yeah that&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="247.53" dur="8.639">amount if you don&amp;#39;t have it and you have</text>
  <text start="250.049" dur="10.5">kids to feed and bills to pay so at this</text>
  <text start="256.169" dur="8.611">point in time the people are suffering</text>
  <text start="260.549" dur="7.411">in Greece and capital controls it does</text>
  <text start="264.78" dur="6.54">not help the people it keeps them in</text>
  <text start="267.96" dur="5.63">limbo they cannot survive and this is</text>
  <text start="271.32" dur="4.62">why everyone has to take responsibility</text>
  <text start="273.59" dur="4.509">to make sure that you&amp;#39;re prepared</text>
  <text start="275.94" dur="3.81">because look one day they were able to</text>
  <text start="278.099" dur="3.81">access their money they were able to</text>
  <text start="279.75" dur="4.28">take it out they can sell their house</text>
  <text start="281.909" dur="6.151">take out the money whenever they need it</text>
  <text start="284.03" dur="6.37">today it&amp;#39;s completely different and</text>
  <text start="288.06" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s with a snap of a finger I mean</text>
  <text start="290.4" dur="4.23">they knew it was coming they saw what</text>
  <text start="291.96" dur="4.709">happened in Cyprus and we know</text>
  <text start="294.63" dur="3.659">eventually because with all the bail and</text>
  <text start="296.669" dur="4.98">documents were created</text>
  <text start="298.289" dur="6.15">back in 2012 going forward we know they</text>
  <text start="301.649" dur="4.711">are prepared and getting ready to do</text>
  <text start="304.439" dur="6.21">something here throughout the eurozone</text>
  <text start="306.36" dur="7.799">in Canada in New Zealand UK we</text>
  <text start="310.649" dur="5.97">understand that and this is why at this</text>
  <text start="314.159" dur="6.15">point in time people need to stock up on</text>
  <text start="316.619" dur="5.82">supplies you need food you need</text>

  <text start="365.279" dur="7.14">wit mean we see things basically</text>
  <text start="369.529" dur="7.301">accelerating at this time we see things</text>
  <text start="372.419" dur="7.11">moving along and we see at this point in</text>
  <text start="376.83" dur="5.16">time it&amp;#39;s not going to slow down at any</text>
  <text start="379.529" dur="6.66">time I mean look at Puerto Rico for</text>
  <text start="381.99" dur="6.419">instance they just defaulted the</text>
  <text start="386.189" dur="5.85">government development bank for Puerto</text>
  <text start="388.409" dur="5.04">Rico President melba acosta febo issued</text>
  <text start="392.039" dur="3.78">the following statement on the surface</text>
  <text start="393.449" dur="4.5">of public finance corporation bonds due</text>
  <text start="395.819" dur="4.83">to the lack of appropriate funds for the</text>
  <text start="397.949" dur="7.8">fiscal year the entirety of the PFC Bay</text>
  <text start="400.649" dur="7.83">payment was not made so basically</text>
  <text start="405.749" dur="7.98">Moody&amp;#39;s view Puerto Rico is in default</text>
  <text start="408.479" dur="8.16">and this is a Commonwealth of the United</text>
  <text start="413.729" dur="5.19">States of America you know the richest</text>
  <text start="416.639" dur="7.71">most powerful nation in the world we had</text>
  <text start="418.919" dur="8.821">a Commonwealth default I mean following</text>
  <text start="424.349" dur="6.78">in the footsteps of Greece and you think</text>
  <text start="427.74" dur="4.41">it ends there look at our cities in the</text>
  <text start="431.129" dur="3.421">United States</text>
  <text start="432.15" dur="6.95">look at Detroit look at Baltimore look</text>
  <text start="434.55" dur="8.4">at Chicago they are in the verge of</text>
  <text start="439.1" dur="7.15">collapsing and when we look closely at</text>
  <text start="442.95" dur="7.44">what&amp;#39;s going on here we see the economy</text>
  <text start="446.25" dur="8.49">is getting worse and worse every single</text>
  <text start="450.39" dur="8.34">day I mean the US consumer spending has</text>
  <text start="454.74" dur="7.47">declined now and we talked about this</text>
  <text start="458.73" dur="6.42">yesterday of course the US government</text>
  <text start="462.21" dur="5.85">the central bankers continually revised</text>
  <text start="465.15" dur="5.42">the number they massaged it and they</text>
  <text start="468.06" dur="6.69">make it look like no everything&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="470.57" dur="7.75">consumers are still spending but Gallup</text>
  <text start="474.75" dur="6.3">did a poll of about 15,000 217 US adults</text>
  <text start="478.32" dur="5.67">who were asked to self-report on their</text>
  <text start="481.05" dur="6.36">daily spending patterns according to the</text>
  <text start="483.99" dur="5.76">Gallup data July was the third month in</text>
  <text start="487.41" dur="4.53">a row in which the average American</text>
  <text start="489.75" dur="6.06">spent less than i did in the same month</text>
  <text start="491.94" dur="6.42">a year ago confirming that the US</text>
  <text start="495.81" dur="4.41">economy is heading into a recession or</text>
  <text start="498.36" dur="3.54">if you believe we&amp;#39;d never left the</text>
  <text start="500.22" dur="5.67">recession we&amp;#39;re heading into a</text>
  <text start="501.9" dur="7.53">depression because what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="505.89" dur="6.63">here is that retail spending data of the</text>
  <text start="509.43" dur="5">seven months in 2015 5 have seen a</text>
  <text start="512.52" dur="5.33">decline in consumer spending</text>
  <text start="514.43" dur="8.88">year-over-year what does this tell us</text>
  <text start="517.85" dur="8.74">this tells us something is wrong here</text>
  <text start="523.31" dur="6.9">because we we have to understand that</text>
  <text start="526.59" dur="7.17">consumers spent spending is important</text>
  <text start="530.21" dur="7.33">because it dictates seventy percent of</text>
  <text start="533.76" dur="5.88">the direction of u.s. gdp and with five</text>
  <text start="537.54" dur="6.06">out of seven months now posting yura</text>
  <text start="539.64" dur="7.02">near declines one wonders just where is</text>
  <text start="543.6" dur="7.47">this two-and-a-half percent gdp growth</text>
  <text start="546.66" dur="9.48">going to come from think about this for</text>
  <text start="551.07" dur="10.68">a second the only way to basically push</text>
  <text start="556.14" dur="8.28">gdp up is to increase your population by</text>
  <text start="561.75" dur="3.96">giving birth more and of course there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="564.42" dur="5.97">factory output and things like that</text>
  <text start="565.71" dur="8.1">or to bring in illegal aliens</text>
  <text start="570.39" dur="6.06">immigration to increase the population</text>
  <text start="573.81" dur="5.79">increase the spending increase the</text>
  <text start="576.45" dur="5.22">people who are working this is how it</text>
  <text start="579.6" dur="5.04">works right now because we know there is</text>
  <text start="581.67" dur="5.79">an agenda here we know this is why</text>
  <text start="584.64" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;re bringing in the illegals to pump</text>
  <text start="587.46" dur="5.16">up the system I mean is that really</text>
  <text start="590.79" dur="3.51">going to pump up the system no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="592.62" dur="3.48">going to give us the illusion that</text>
  <text start="594.3" dur="6.6">everything is fine but when we look at</text>
  <text start="596.1" dur="11.52">factory orders right now they have</text>
  <text start="600.9" dur="9">plunged for eight consecutive months us</text>
  <text start="607.62" dur="4.98">factory orders fell year-on-year down</text>
  <text start="609.9" dur="5.16">six point two percent in June this is</text>
  <text start="612.6" dur="5.12">the longest streak of declining factory</text>
  <text start="615.06" dur="5.67">orders outside of a recession in history</text>
  <text start="617.72" dur="6.7">much of the month a month gain was</text>
  <text start="620.73" dur="8.6">driven by a twenty one percent rise and</text>
  <text start="624.42" dur="8.61">defense aircraft shipments while we know</text>
  <text start="629.33" dur="10.36">we have wars going on everywhere we know</text>
  <text start="633.03" dur="11.07">we&amp;#39;re shipping war materials strip that</text>
  <text start="639.69" dur="10.68">out factory orders are about ten times</text>
  <text start="644.1" dur="11.76">worse this is not a robust economy this</text>
  <text start="650.37" dur="7.17">economy is completely falling apart yes</text>
  <text start="655.86" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re going to keep the illusion alive</text>
  <text start="657.54" dur="3.75">yes they&amp;#39;re going to convince you not to</text>
  <text start="659.34" dur="5.46">take gold because they continually</text>
  <text start="661.29" dur="4.5">suppress it we see this every day but</text>
  <text start="664.8" dur="4.32">there&amp;#39;s something I want to talk about</text>
  <text start="665.79" dur="8.46">here I want to talk about gold I mean</text>
  <text start="669.12" dur="7.35">gold has about a 5,000 year of tradition</text>
  <text start="674.25" dur="4.32">behind it and people look at this little</text>
  <text start="676.47" dur="6.57">short term graph and say oh look it went</text>
  <text start="678.57" dur="6.57">down a little bit okay over 5,000 years</text>
  <text start="683.04" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s been around how long is the dollar</text>
  <text start="685.14" dur="6.12">been around how long has any of these</text>
  <text start="687.54" dur="5.7">paper currencies been around so when</text>
  <text start="691.26" dur="3.24">people say oh I wouldn&amp;#39;t buy gold it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="693.24" dur="4.23">not a good investment well gold is not</text>
  <text start="694.5" dur="5.21">an investment whoever said gold was an</text>
  <text start="697.47" dur="7.83">investment</text>
  <text start="699.71" dur="7.62">Gold is a store of wealth so when we</text>
  <text start="705.3" dur="5.39">look at gold we see countries</text>
  <text start="707.33" dur="6.54">continually taking it on China Russia</text>
  <text start="710.69" dur="7.84">other central banks around the world are</text>
  <text start="713.87" dur="7.06">taking on gold not the United States so</text>
  <text start="718.53" dur="5.58">we understand that China with this low</text>
  <text start="720.93" dur="8.06">gold prices continually purchasing tons</text>
  <text start="724.11" dur="7.38">and tons of gold and we all understand</text>
  <text start="728.99" dur="9.67">when we look at gold over a long period</text>
  <text start="731.49" dur="12.99">of time that gold basically keeps your</text>
  <text start="738.66" dur="8.55">wealth I mean we have to remember why we</text>
  <text start="744.48" dur="5.82">own gold to begin with Gold is a very</text>
  <text start="747.21" dur="5.16">long term store of value paper</text>
  <text start="750.3" dur="3.93">currencies come and go they get to</text>
  <text start="752.37" dur="4.83">valued revalued and extinguished all</text>
  <text start="754.23" dur="5.07">together I mean think about this how</text>
  <text start="757.2" dur="4.05">much would you be able to buy today with</text>
  <text start="759.3" dur="6.15">a paper money issued by the 7th century</text>
  <text start="761.25" dur="7.23">tang dynasty nothing it no longer exists</text>
  <text start="765.45" dur="6.12">but guess what gold was around then and</text>

  <text start="784.32" dur="7.16">1817 is worth over two hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="786.72" dur="7.17">dollars today so what are we seeing here</text>
  <text start="791.48" dur="4.12">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us with</text>
  <text start="793.89" dur="3.93">continually suppressing the gold that</text>
  <text start="795.6" dur="6.45">that is not where you want to be you</text>
  <text start="797.82" dur="6.21">want to be in the dollar well actually</text>
  <text start="802.05" dur="3.6">you want to be in both because we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="804.03" dur="3.33">know how this is going to play or how</text>
  <text start="805.65" dur="2.88">long it&amp;#39;s going to play out and you want</text>
  <text start="807.36" dur="4.29">to maintain your wealth and you know</text>
  <text start="808.53" dur="6.09">gold silver is the way to do it because</text>
  <text start="811.65" dur="6.6">we know paper currencies come and go</text>
  <text start="814.62" dur="7.26">they don&amp;#39;t stick around and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="818.25" dur="7.65">always re-evaluated or drop completely</text>
  <text start="821.88" dur="7.29">into something else and this is why</text>
  <text start="825.9" dur="5.61">everybody today needs to have some type</text>
  <text start="829.17" dur="4.23">of precious metal and people say oh I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="831.51" dur="5.88">not going to do that gold content</text>
  <text start="833.4" dur="7.05">drops it&amp;#39;s not worth it whatsoever well</text>
  <text start="837.39" dur="4.65">if I told you today then HDTV was going</text>
  <text start="840.45" dur="2.64">on sale it&amp;#39;s going to be a hundred or</text>
  <text start="842.04" dur="3.24">one hundred and fifty dollars less</text>
  <text start="843.09" dur="3.96">people will go really I better go out</text>
  <text start="845.28" dur="3.96">and buy it so you just went out your</text>
  <text start="847.05" dur="5.07">board a depreciating asset that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="849.24" dur="6.63">to be worth absolutely nothing in the</text>
  <text start="852.12" dur="7.17">end if I tell you that gold is on sale</text>
  <text start="855.87" dur="4.8">today and it it&amp;#39;s on sale for you know</text>
  <text start="859.29" dur="4.17">came down and prized about one hundred</text>
  <text start="860.67" dur="4.86">and hundred fifty dollars you can look</text>
  <text start="863.46" dur="3.72">back in time and say okay this is</text>
  <text start="865.53" dur="5.58">something that I should do now because</text>
  <text start="867.18" dur="7.44">I&amp;#39;m getting in at the bottom level and I</text>
  <text start="871.11" dur="7.35">know eventually it&amp;#39;s going to go up and</text>
  <text start="874.62" dur="7.55">even if it doesn&amp;#39;t and it goes down a</text>
  <text start="878.46" dur="6.93">little bit it goes up a little bit</text>
  <text start="882.17" dur="4.81">eventually over time because we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="885.39" dur="4.95">going to go sell it like the paper gold</text>
  <text start="886.98" dur="5.55">it&amp;#39;s a store of wealth you hold on to it</text>
  <text start="890.34" dur="5.04">for a long period of time because when</text>
  <text start="892.53" dur="7.71">that situation comes and we have a</text>
  <text start="895.38" dur="7.2">collapse you pull the gold out just like</text>
  <text start="900.24" dur="4.38">when there&amp;#39;s a storm and you have a</text>
