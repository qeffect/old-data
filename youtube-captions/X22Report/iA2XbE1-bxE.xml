  <text start="62.6" dur="4.64">US government central bankers have</text>
  <text start="64.519" dur="5.88">placed on the precious metal market and</text>
  <text start="67.24" dur="5.2">something very interesting with all</text>

  <text start="93.2" dur="5.729">survive without the government money and</text>
  <text start="96.459" dur="5.171">we don&amp;#39;t know why this is occurring at</text>
  <text start="98.929" dur="5.31">this point in time it could be some type</text>
  <text start="101.63" dur="6.03">of glitch it could be some type of</text>
  <text start="104.239" dur="6.75">malware it could be the government may</text>

  <text start="110.989" dur="7.171">don&amp;#39;t know at this point but this should</text>
  <text start="114.2" dur="7.38">show us something that if we are in some</text>
  <text start="118.16" dur="6.659">type of economic collapse scenario which</text>
  <text start="121.58" dur="6.69">we know we&amp;#39;re headed into the government</text>
  <text start="124.819" dur="6.361">will not have the ability to pay certain</text>
  <text start="128.27" dur="6.12">things and all those that all those</text>
  <text start="131.18" dur="5.669">people that are depending on this we</text>
  <text start="134.39" dur="5.819">might they might have to figure</text>
  <text start="136.849" dur="6.661">something else out and when we talk</text>
  <text start="140.209" dur="7.591">about the economic collapse we realize</text>
  <text start="143.51" dur="6.54">that many of the people that are</text>
  <text start="147.8" dur="5.79">depending who can&amp;#39;t get food any other</text>
  <text start="150.05" dur="5.85">way who haven&amp;#39;t been prepping they might</text>
  <text start="153.59" dur="5.25">become desperate and I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="155.9" dur="3.78">these are bad people I&amp;#39;m not saying you</text>
  <text start="158.84" dur="3.03">know these are the people that you</text>
  <text start="159.68" dur="4.139">should be afraid of but it could be</text>
  <text start="161.87" dur="3.869">anyone not just people on EBT</text>
  <text start="163.819" dur="3.331">it could be people that are just going</text>
  <text start="165.739" dur="3.991">about their business working every</text>
  <text start="167.15" dur="4.199">single day at their job all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="169.73" dur="3.81">everything comes to a screeching halt</text>
  <text start="171.349" dur="4.56">they get laid off there is no</text>
  <text start="173.54" dur="5.789">unemployment insurance they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="175.909" dur="5.101">what to do the dollar is devaluing their</text>
  <text start="179.329" dur="3.3">running around trying to find food they</text>
  <text start="181.01" dur="4.679">become desperate they don&amp;#39;t know what to</text>
  <text start="182.629" dur="4.86">do with their family and people resort</text>
  <text start="185.689" dur="3.27">to other methods and this is not</text>
  <text start="187.489" dur="3.84">something that&amp;#39;s just being made up we</text>
  <text start="188.959" dur="4.89">have seen this in other countries I mean</text>
  <text start="191.329" dur="3.871">take it for example Venezuela we see</text>
  <text start="193.849" dur="3.87">people standing on line for a</text>
  <text start="195.2" dur="6.06">supermarket and people rushing and</text>
  <text start="197.719" dur="5.94">fighting over meat we see it here in the</text>
  <text start="201.26" dur="3.509">United States during the Christmas</text>
  <text start="203.659" dur="4.26">holiday when everyone supposed to be</text>
  <text start="204.769" dur="4.64">happy joyful as soon as Walmart opens</text>
  <text start="207.919" dur="4.65">their door people are running in</text>
  <text start="209.409" dur="6.431">stepping on people punching people to</text>
  <text start="212.569" dur="7.32">get a good deal on some piece of</text>
  <text start="215.84" dur="8.22">electronic or other device but with this</text>
  <text start="219.889" dur="6.901">EBT system we see the down detector</text>
  <text start="224.06" dur="5.37">which is down to Tector calm it has</text>
  <text start="226.79" dur="7.86">reported that the US government has had</text>
  <text start="229.43" dur="9.119">over 2700 reports of being down or late</text>
  <text start="234.65" dur="5.549">loading money onto the EBT cards so this</text>
  <text start="238.549" dur="3.93">is something that we need to watch very</text>
  <text start="240.199" dur="4.32">carefully and look at this problem</text>
  <text start="242.479" dur="6.18">because as we move forward we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="244.519" dur="6.631">to see a lot more of this now wholesale</text>
  <text start="248.659" dur="4.401">inventories they rose more than expected</text>
  <text start="251.15" dur="4.35">in April they&amp;#39;re up by point-six percent</text>
  <text start="253.06" dur="6.34">month a month is the biggest monthly</text>
  <text start="255.5" dur="7.199">jump in ten months but sales they have</text>
  <text start="259.4" dur="5.67">disappointed rising only about 1.0</text>
  <text start="262.699" dur="4.53">percent and they expected about 1.1</text>
  <text start="265.07" dur="5.31">percent increase but when we look at the</text>
  <text start="267.229" dur="5.22">inventory to sales ratio it remains at</text>
  <text start="270.38" dur="6.11">one point three five times this is the</text>
  <text start="272.449" dur="7.381">highest level since Lehman and</text>
  <text start="276.49" dur="7.72">inventories keep building even no sales</text>
  <text start="279.83" dur="6.089">are declining year over a year which is</text>
  <text start="284.21" dur="3.959">a concern because we&amp;#39;ve seen this once</text>
  <text start="285.919" dur="4.8">before we&amp;#39;ve seen this during the Great</text>
  <text start="288.169" dur="7.081">Recession of 2008 and we&amp;#39;re headed right</text>
  <text start="290.719" dur="6.901">into that area now everyone talks about</text>
  <text start="295.25" dur="5.24">growth and how the central bank</text>
  <text start="297.62" dur="7.2">can create growth by spreading more debt</text>
  <text start="300.49" dur="8.83">well when we look at growth and we look</text>
  <text start="304.82" dur="8.94">at debt we see the first quarter of this</text>
  <text start="309.32" dur="7.409">year it costs ten dollars in new debt to</text>
  <text start="313.76" dur="6.93">generate one not one dollar in new</text>
  <text start="316.729" dur="11.961">economic growth and when we look over</text>
  <text start="320.69" dur="12.53">time showing credit verse GDP since 1950</text>
  <text start="328.69" dur="8.41">we see the trend it doesn&amp;#39;t look good</text>
  <text start="333.22" dur="7.87">because we see the amount of debt rising</text>
  <text start="337.1" dur="8.01">very very rapidly GDP not really going</text>
  <text start="341.09" dur="7.34">anywhere and this is why the central</text>
  <text start="345.11" dur="6.75">banker system with all of this debt is</text>
  <text start="348.43" dur="5.769">never ever going to work and actually</text>
  <text start="351.86" dur="5.55">when you look at the graph and you go</text>
  <text start="354.199" dur="5.011">back to 1971 this is when it started to</text>
  <text start="357.41" dur="3.479">separate when we when we came off the</text>
  <text start="359.21" dur="5.579">gold standard and the central bank</text>
  <text start="360.889" dur="7.021">started to print currency out of thin</text>
  <text start="364.789" dur="4.831">air as much as they wanted and as we</text>
  <text start="367.91" dur="4.35">move through the 80s and 90s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="369.62" dur="5.49">separating even more when we hit 2014</text>
  <text start="372.26" dur="6.36">going forward it is at its widest point</text>
  <text start="375.11" dur="7.19">and we&amp;#39;ve never seen it wider than this</text>
  <text start="378.62" dur="8.28">since going all the way back to the 50s</text>
  <text start="382.3" dur="6.61">now we hear a lot about the US</text>
  <text start="386.9" dur="2.97">government the central bankers how</text>
  <text start="388.91" dur="2.819">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us that</text>
  <text start="389.87" dur="4.38">unemployment is down at four-point-seven</text>
  <text start="391.729" dur="4.681">percent how we&amp;#39;re in full recovery</text>
  <text start="394.25" dur="3.93">everything is fine don&amp;#39;t worry about it</text>
  <text start="396.41" dur="3.78">you have to believe us and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="398.18" dur="3.299">looking at the job numbers and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="400.19" dur="3.86">been looking at retail we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="401.479" dur="5.431">looking at all the economic sectors and</text>
  <text start="404.05" dur="4.119">we keep countering what the US</text>
  <text start="406.91" dur="5.67">government central bankers have been</text>
  <text start="408.169" dur="6.841">saying and one other indicator that has</text>
  <text start="412.58" dur="5.67">come out is the US federal personal tax</text>
  <text start="415.01" dur="5.279">receipts and this is a very good</text>
  <text start="418.25" dur="4.62">indicator because it shows us that</text>
  <text start="420.289" dur="5.401">people either have very low paying jobs</text>
  <text start="422.87" dur="6.15">which are part-time jobs or no jobs at</text>
  <text start="425.69" dur="5.35">all and these tax receipts they are</text>
  <text start="429.02" dur="6.12">falling fast</text>
  <text start="431.04" dur="8.04">so is the Evercore is I state tax survey</text>
  <text start="435.14" dur="7.48">the last time actually the last two</text>
  <text start="439.08" dur="8.25">times the survey plunged this much the</text>
  <text start="442.62" dur="6.78">US was already in a recession now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="447.33" dur="5.25">very interesting about this you would</text>
  <text start="449.4" dur="5.37">think that as the government continually</text>
  <text start="452.58" dur="4.41">comes out and says you know where</text>
  <text start="454.77" dur="4.32">unemployment at nine percent bread</text>
  <text start="456.99" dur="4.83">unemployment at eight percent we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="459.09" dur="4.65">unemployment at seven six five here we</text>
  <text start="461.82" dur="3.99">are at four-point-seven percent we would</text>
  <text start="463.74" dur="4.53">see the tax receipts increase wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="465.81" dur="6.21">you more people are working more people</text>
  <text start="468.27" dur="6.93">are making money more taxes are coming</text>
  <text start="472.02" dur="6.23">into the government well we actually see</text>
  <text start="475.2" dur="6.15">the opposite which is a head-scratcher</text>
  <text start="478.25" dur="5.95">why would that be so let&amp;#39;s put all this</text>
  <text start="481.35" dur="8.67">together here we see tax receipts</text>
  <text start="484.2" dur="7.68">falling as unemployment is dropping the</text>
  <text start="490.02" dur="5.37">percentage of unemployed people it</text>
  <text start="491.88" dur="5.58">continually drops makes no sense we see</text>
  <text start="495.39" dur="7.2">the unemployment rate continually drop</text>
  <text start="497.46" dur="7.16">and we see retail contracting hmm as the</text>
  <text start="502.59" dur="5.88">unemployment number continually drops</text>
  <text start="504.62" dur="6.75">CEOs of retail stores are saying their</text>
  <text start="508.47" dur="7.1">sales are declining very interesting as</text>
  <text start="511.37" dur="9.52">the unemployment rate drops we see GDP</text>
  <text start="515.57" dur="9.34">declining as the unemployment rate drops</text>
  <text start="520.89" dur="13.43">we see the production of manufactured</text>
  <text start="524.91" dur="9.41">goods dropping as unemployment decreases</text>
  <text start="534.71" dur="5.91">we see the service sector to climb</text>
  <text start="541.37" dur="6.7">there&amp;#39;s something wrong here the</text>
  <text start="544.44" dur="5.22">statistical information which is being</text>
  <text start="548.07" dur="8.15">produced by the government and the</text>
  <text start="549.66" dur="9.12">central bank makes no sense because what</text>
  <text start="556.22" dur="6.16">they&amp;#39;re telling us we should see the</text>
  <text start="558.78" dur="5.88">opposite happening actually we should</text>
  <text start="562.38" dur="4.47">see incredible</text>
  <text start="564.66" dur="5.789">revenue coming into the government we</text>
  <text start="566.85" dur="5.88">should see it increasing over time but</text>
  <text start="570.449" dur="5.461">when we look at the information we see</text>
  <text start="572.73" dur="4.859">the opposite happening and actually we</text>
  <text start="575.91" dur="3.63">saw this back in two thousand eight when</text>
  <text start="577.589" dur="3.75">people started to lose their jobs and</text>
  <text start="579.54" dur="6">they were laid off like we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="581.339" dur="8.881">seeing here in 2015 2016 the tax</text>
  <text start="585.54" dur="8">receipts plunged and going into 2009 to</text>
  <text start="590.22" dur="5.669">2010 they were at their lowest point</text>
  <text start="593.54" dur="7.029">well we&amp;#39;ve hit that point right now</text>
  <text start="595.889" dur="6.18">where the economy is already in a</text>
  <text start="600.569" dur="4.14">recession when we hit this point and</text>
  <text start="602.069" dur="5.52">we&amp;#39;re at it right now so we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="604.709" dur="5.641">in a recession heading towards a</text>
  <text start="607.589" dur="6.06">collapse so we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="610.35" dur="6.45">president is continually lying to the</text>
  <text start="613.649" dur="5.761">people actually he&amp;#39;s the one peddling</text>
  <text start="616.8" dur="4.11">this fiction once again because</text>
  <text start="619.41" dur="3.45">everything that comes out of the</text>
  <text start="620.91" dur="3.989">government is always the opposite they</text>
  <text start="622.86" dur="3.63">tell you the economy&amp;#39;s doing well you</text>
  <text start="624.899" dur="4.56">better prepare yourself because it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="626.49" dur="4.589">if they&amp;#39;re telling you that Obamacare is</text>
  <text start="629.459" dur="5.671">going to be affordable guess what</text>
  <text start="631.079" dur="7.711">absolutely not patriot act opposite USA</text>
  <text start="635.13" dur="6.149">Freedom Act opposite no boots on the</text>
  <text start="638.79" dur="5.489">ground opposite we&amp;#39;re not going to put</text>
  <text start="641.279" dur="7.29">boots into Syria the opposite it is</text>
  <text start="644.279" dur="8.941">always the opposite of what they say now</text>
  <text start="648.569" dur="7.01">out in Japan we see that Japan&amp;#39;s second</text>
  <text start="653.22" dur="4.95">quarter is off to a disastrous start as</text>
  <text start="655.579" dur="5.771">machinery orders crash by eleven percent</text>
  <text start="658.17" dur="7.71">month on month in April and this is the</text>
  <text start="661.35" dur="7.44">worst start since April of 2009 and it</text>
  <text start="665.88" dur="6.6">looks like Japan might be going into the</text>
  <text start="668.79" dur="5.96">seventh recessionary GDP since the</text>
  <text start="672.48" dur="5.69">crisis and this does not look good</text>
  <text start="674.75" dur="5.98">something very interesting coming out of</text>
  <text start="678.17" dur="5.769">Mervyn King former governor of the Bank</text>
  <text start="680.73" dur="7.38">of England and he believes that in</text>
  <text start="683.939" dur="7.26">certain circumstances China&amp;#39;s assets in</text>
  <text start="688.11" dur="5.459">the u.s. could be annulled the US would</text>
  <text start="691.199" dur="7.211">not want to renege on its debt but if</text>
  <text start="693.569" dur="7.871">some awful instance should happen</text>
  <text start="698.41" dur="4.909">china&amp;#39;s assets in the US there&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="701.44" dur="4.949">possibility that they could be an old</text>
  <text start="703.319" dur="6.07">now the choice of the word an old</text>
  <text start="706.389" dur="6.361">suggests some kind of deliberate action</text>
  <text start="709.389" dur="8.581">and under what scenario could this</text>
  <text start="712.75" dur="9.06">happen well it could be maybe war if the</text>
  <text start="717.97" dur="6.809">US gets into war with China the US could</text>
  <text start="721.81" dur="5.87">turn around and say okay we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="724.779" dur="6.781">cancel the treasury&amp;#39;s that china owns</text>
  <text start="727.68" dur="7.509">we&amp;#39;re not going to repay and all of the</text>
  <text start="731.56" dur="9.48">assets that china owns were gonna take</text>
  <text start="735.189" dur="8.221">and this is a strong possibility now</text>
  <text start="741.04" dur="5.039">Deutsche Bank they are out there and</text>
  <text start="743.41" dur="5.969">they are continually warning about</text>
  <text start="746.079" dur="7.26">social unrest and another Great</text>
  <text start="749.379" dur="5.46">Depression heading our way and it seems</text>
  <text start="753.339" dur="3.721">like they&amp;#39;re continually out there</text>
  <text start="754.839" dur="6.99">letting everyone know that yes something</text>
