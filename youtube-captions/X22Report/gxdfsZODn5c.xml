  <text start="97.659" dur="5.221">something they expected they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="100.21" dur="5.4">expect the people to say let&amp;#39;s leave</text>
  <text start="102.88" dur="5.76">this wasn&amp;#39;t part of their plan their</text>
  <text start="105.61" dur="6.54">plan was to remain to bring down the</text>
  <text start="108.64" dur="5.31">economy when they were ready now that</text>
  <text start="112.15" dur="5.009">they want to leave this is like</text>
  <text start="113.95" dur="4.559">something out of left field and we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="125.799" dur="5.371">because remember the economy is going to</text>
  <text start="129.31" dur="3.51">be brought down by them they know</text>
  <text start="131.17" dur="3.51">exactly when they&amp;#39;re going to bring it</text>
  <text start="132.82" dur="4.35">down they know who they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="134.68" dur="5.58">blame we know they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="137.17" dur="4.83">bring us to war and something like this</text>
  <text start="140.26" dur="6.3">this does not fit into their playbook</text>
  <text start="142" dur="6.45">and we can see right now they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="146.56" dur="5.04">to make it look like that everything is</text>
  <text start="148.45" dur="5.91">fine that the economy is still doing</text>
  <text start="151.6" dur="4.47">well this is nothing to be worried about</text>
  <text start="154.36" dur="4.589">but this is something very big to be</text>
  <text start="156.07" dur="5.039">worried about because this just adds to</text>
  <text start="158.949" dur="4.471">the problems of what&amp;#39;s going on right</text>
  <text start="161.109" dur="4.141">now and</text>
  <text start="163.42" dur="4.35">we know the economy&amp;#39;s been failing all</text>
  <text start="165.25" dur="4.739">along we&amp;#39;ve been looking at many</text>
  <text start="167.77" dur="4.469">different economic indicators and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="169.989" dur="4.741">been tracking layoffs I mean there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="172.239" dur="5.311">layoffs after layoffs I mean look at Dow</text>
  <text start="174.73" dur="4.92">Chemical they&amp;#39;re laying off 2,500 people</text>
  <text start="177.55" dur="4.5">I know they&amp;#39;re merging with Corning and</text>
  <text start="179.65" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re letting people go but still</text>
  <text start="182.05" dur="4.29">these people will not have jobs just</text>
  <text start="184.87" dur="3.42">like the rest of the people will not</text>
  <text start="186.34" dur="5.04">have jobs this is four percent of their</text>
  <text start="188.29" dur="8.1">workforce and we&amp;#39;re getting word there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="191.38" dur="7.26">more layoffs coming now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="196.39" dur="5.01">talking about real estate quite a bit</text>
  <text start="198.64" dur="6.599">and we&amp;#39;ve been talking about housing</text>
  <text start="201.4" dur="7.29">prices coming down the bubble is popping</text>
  <text start="205.239" dur="5.671">and we know the central bankers they set</text>
  <text start="208.69" dur="4.32">up a certain number of cities they blew</text>
  <text start="210.91" dur="4.049">the bubbles up in those cities and the</text>
  <text start="213.01" dur="4.62">rest of the outlying areas they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="214.959" dur="5.34">seeing not what these cities are saying</text>
  <text start="217.63" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re seeing the opposite well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="220.299" dur="7.981">starting to spread now case-shiller and</text>
  <text start="223.54" dur="8.94">we know they have their 20 city 20-city</text>
  <text start="228.28" dur="6.45">index now it rose by point four five</text>
  <text start="232.48" dur="3.84">percent month on month and they thought</text>
  <text start="234.73" dur="3.99">it was going to rise point eight five</text>
  <text start="236.32" dur="5.009">percent now people say well it did rise</text>
  <text start="238.72" dur="4.95">a little bit but this shows us it&amp;#39;s slow</text>
  <text start="241.329" dur="4.741">it&amp;#39;s starting to slow down in out in San</text>
  <text start="243.67" dur="5.039">Francisco which we&amp;#39;ve reported on before</text>
  <text start="246.07" dur="5.669">we talked about how prices are starting</text>
  <text start="248.709" dur="5.691">to come down and now we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="251.739" dur="8.06">see a picture of what&amp;#39;s really happening</text>
  <text start="254.4" dur="8.41">in San Francisco right now year-on-year</text>
  <text start="259.799" dur="6.611">housing prices have fallen by eighteen</text>
  <text start="262.81" dur="5.19">percent I mean do you hear the sound of</text>
  <text start="266.41" dur="3.81">air flowing out of the bubble right now</text>
  <text start="268" dur="6">because this is exactly what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="270.22" dur="6.78">and when we look at the situation we see</text>
  <text start="274" dur="6.51">that New York San Francisco and many</text>
  <text start="277" dur="5.97">different areas are all starting to feel</text>
  <text start="280.51" dur="6.3">the same thing because what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="282.97" dur="6.569">right now is that the economic decline</text>
  <text start="286.81" dur="5.16">is starting to spread just like we</text>
  <text start="289.539" dur="3.961">thought it was going to do of course</text>
  <text start="291.97" dur="3.75">everyone&amp;#39;s looking like well in my city</text>
  <text start="293.5" dur="3.87">it seems like everything is fine but i</text>
  <text start="295.72" dur="5.43">did a little</text>
  <text start="297.37" dur="6.18">poking around today to see how the East</text>
  <text start="301.15" dur="4.17">was doing how the southwest was doing</text>
  <text start="303.55" dur="4.47">and you know what I see it&amp;#39;s very easy</text>
  <text start="305.32" dur="4.98">to do just going to Zillow take a look</text>
  <text start="308.02" dur="4.29">at your neighborhood look at the people</text>
  <text start="310.3" dur="4.53">that are selling and what you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="312.31" dur="3.72">to find out is that a lot of the people</text>
  <text start="314.83" dur="3.42">almost the majority of the people</text>
  <text start="316.03" dur="4.919">they&amp;#39;ve been lowering their price you</text>
  <text start="318.25" dur="5.729">can see how long their house has been on</text>
  <text start="320.949" dur="4.97">the market now I&amp;#39;ve been looking all</text>
  <text start="323.979" dur="5.81">around and I&amp;#39;m seeing this spread</text>
  <text start="325.919" dur="7.331">further and further to different areas</text>
  <text start="329.789" dur="5.531">and this is what happened prior to two</text>
  <text start="333.25" dur="5.58">thousand eight and we&amp;#39;re seeing it</text>
  <text start="335.32" dur="7.11">happen right now now the richmond fed</text>
  <text start="338.83" dur="6.27">well it is collapsed to negative 7 this</text>
  <text start="342.43" dur="5.609">is the lowest since january of 2013 new</text>
  <text start="345.1" dur="6.539">order that volume has completely crashed</text>
  <text start="348.039" dur="5.961">and we&amp;#39;re seeing that future</text>
  <text start="351.639" dur="5.34">expectations of hiring and work week is</text>
  <text start="354" dur="4.69">plunging right now so when we look at</text>
  <text start="356.979" dur="5.131">all these economic indicators what are</text>
  <text start="358.69" dur="7.74">we seeing we are seeing there going from</text>
  <text start="362.11" dur="7.71">bad to worse and it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="366.43" dur="5.7">improve it&amp;#39;s impossible and we see that</text>
  <text start="369.82" dur="4.77">this is impossible yes do we see little</text>
  <text start="372.13" dur="4.71">bounce ups but when we step back and we</text>
  <text start="374.59" dur="5.639">look at the trend it is a downward trend</text>
  <text start="376.84" dur="6.27">now of course the b EA they came out</text>
  <text start="380.229" dur="5.19">with their first quarter GDP you know</text>
  <text start="383.11" dur="5.07">they manipulated it they revised and</text>
  <text start="385.419" dur="7.051">they went from point 5 to point 8 2 1</text>
  <text start="388.18" dur="7.56">now 2 1 point 1 look we&amp;#39;ve recovered we</text>
  <text start="392.47" dur="6.36">hit one point one percent in GDP well</text>
  <text start="395.74" dur="5.1">that&amp;#39;s absolutely awful for a recovery</text>
  <text start="398.83" dur="4.35">with employment at four-point-seven</text>
  <text start="400.84" dur="3.9">percent people should be spending like</text>
  <text start="403.18" dur="5.489">crazy which is seventy percent of the</text>
  <text start="404.74" dur="7.92">gdp we should she GDP skyrocketing but</text>
  <text start="408.669" dur="4.861">we don&amp;#39;t why is that well when we look</text>
  <text start="412.66" dur="4.92">at the numbers and we look at</text>
  <text start="413.53" dur="6.69">unemployment these are all fake people</text>
  <text start="417.58" dur="4.29">are not out there working this is why</text>
  <text start="420.22" dur="4.199">they&amp;#39;re not spending this is why</text>
  <text start="421.87" dur="5.64">factories aren&amp;#39;t producing it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="424.419" dur="6.811">simple it&amp;#39;s common sense but when we</text>
  <text start="427.51" dur="6.36">look at GDP what brought GDP</text>
  <text start="431.23" dur="5.34">this is the big question how are they</text>
  <text start="433.87" dur="4.86">continually getting a positive GDP</text>
  <text start="436.57" dur="6.68">number we know they manipulate that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="438.73" dur="9.93">fact but when we look at this we see</text>
  <text start="443.25" dur="11.08">Obamacare Obamacare accounted for</text>
  <text start="448.66" dur="9.48">fifty-eight percent of us growth is this</text>
  <text start="454.33" dur="9.84">really growth people spending money on</text>
  <text start="458.14" dur="12.63">health care no this is not growth if you</text>
  <text start="464.17" dur="9.12">strip this out GDP is negative we are in</text>
  <text start="470.77" dur="8.06">disaster mode right now now when we look</text>
  <text start="473.29" dur="10.5">at the numbers gdp grew by 44 billion or</text>
  <text start="478.83" dur="9.16">1.1 percent annual eyes and when we look</text>
  <text start="483.79" dur="9.09">at this 26 billion of it was from health</text>
  <text start="487.99" dur="9.54">care so this shows us that the economy</text>
  <text start="492.88" dur="7.53">is not really growing this economy is</text>
  <text start="497.53" dur="5.85">doomed and it&amp;#39;s getting harder and</text>
  <text start="500.41" dur="5.55">harder to manipulate these numbers</text>
  <text start="503.38" dur="6.54">because when you look through them and</text>
  <text start="505.96" dur="5.85">you look through all the propaganda from</text>
  <text start="509.92" dur="4.26">the government and the corporate media</text>
  <text start="511.81" dur="6.06">and you look through all that stuff and</text>
  <text start="514.18" dur="5.4">you see the root of the problem and you</text>
  <text start="517.87" dur="4.59">see what&amp;#39;s really going on you see that</text>
  <text start="519.58" dur="6.93">there&amp;#39;s no way that this economy can</text>
  <text start="522.46" dur="7.14">survive actually CNN did a poll and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="526.51" dur="6.69">sure that they&amp;#39;re shocked at the results</text>
  <text start="529.6" dur="5.46">so they asked people which of the</text>
  <text start="533.2" dur="4.22">following comes closer to your opinion</text>
  <text start="535.06" dur="4.77">on the economic system in the US and</text>
  <text start="537.42" dur="4.45">people had the choice to select three</text>
  <text start="539.83" dur="4.14">different options the economic system is</text>
  <text start="541.87" dur="4.5">rigged in favor of certain groups the</text>
  <text start="543.97" dur="6.36">economy system is fair to all Americans</text>
  <text start="546.37" dur="6.24">I just don&amp;#39;t know and 71 percent of the</text>
  <text start="550.33" dur="6.24">people said that the economy is</text>
  <text start="552.61" dur="6.74">completely rigged it didn&amp;#39;t matter if</text>
  <text start="556.57" dur="5.4">the person was white black Hispanic</text>
  <text start="559.35" dur="4.58">didn&amp;#39;t matter if the Republican Democrat</text>
  <text start="561.97" dur="5.17">or independent</text>
  <text start="563.93" dur="6.42">matter they believed the economy is</text>
  <text start="567.14" dur="5.4">rigged now this is very interesting</text>
  <text start="570.35" dur="3.989">because if the people believe the</text>
  <text start="572.54" dur="4.56">economy&amp;#39;s rig that means they believe</text>
  <text start="574.339" dur="5.491">the government must be lying to them if</text>
  <text start="577.1" dur="9.179">the government is lying to them what</text>
  <text start="579.83" dur="8.52">else are they lying about now because of</text>
  <text start="586.279" dur="5.941">the brexit we know this is all being</text>
  <text start="588.35" dur="5.7">blamed on the people of the UK they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="592.22" dur="4.05">caused this this is their problem and</text>
  <text start="594.05" dur="4.92">the corporate media is out there and</text>
  <text start="596.27" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re pushing the idea that the</text>
  <text start="598.97" dur="5.28">sterling is continually dropping it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="601.82" dur="4.94">historic collapse we&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="604.25" dur="7.38">anything like this in our lifetime well</text>
  <text start="606.76" dur="6.22">that isn&amp;#39;t really true now although it</text>
  <text start="611.63" dur="3.36">is the biggest drop since the collapse</text>
  <text start="612.98" dur="5.52">of the Bretton Woods system in the 70s</text>
  <text start="614.99" dur="8.34">there have been eight bigger daily down</text>
  <text start="618.5" dur="8.7">moves since 1862 the bigger moves were</text>
  <text start="623.33" dur="9.03">in September of 1949 negative thirty</text>
  <text start="627.2" dur="9.21">percent we see September 1931 negative</text>
  <text start="632.36" dur="7.89">twenty-three percent September 1869</text>
  <text start="636.41" dur="8.01">negative eighteen percent November 1967</text>
  <text start="640.25" dur="8.04">negative thirteen percent March 1863</text>
  <text start="644.42" dur="6.84">negative ten percent so we can see there</text>
  <text start="648.29" dur="5.669">are many different instances where the</text>
  <text start="651.26" dur="5.67">Sterling has dropped and dropped much</text>
  <text start="653.959" dur="5.311">further than it has during this brexit</text>
  <text start="656.93" dur="3.57">but of course the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="659.27" dur="4.02">government&amp;#39;s the central banks they</text>
  <text start="660.5" dur="6.329">really want to play this up and we see</text>
  <text start="663.29" dur="5.039">right now as the UK leaves the EU which</text>
  <text start="666.829" dur="4.231">they haven&amp;#39;t really done yet this was a</text>
  <text start="668.329" dur="8.551">referendum the Parliament hasn&amp;#39;t voted</text>
  <text start="671.06" dur="9.44">yet we see the currency is declining</text>
  <text start="676.88" dur="7.11">actually this is going to improve trade</text>
  <text start="680.5" dur="5.55">for the country and this is what the</text>
  <text start="683.99" dur="4.849">central bankers are really worried about</text>
  <text start="686.05" dur="6.88">that they&amp;#39;re going you&amp;#39;re going to see a</text>
  <text start="688.839" dur="6.131">country do much much better when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="692.93" dur="3.899">not part of the EU central banking</text>
  <text start="694.97" dur="2.99">system this is what they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="696.829" dur="5.191">worried about</text>
  <text start="697.96" dur="7.42">so during this time we see Moody&amp;#39;s S&amp;amp;P</text>
  <text start="702.02" dur="5.82">and now itch they have downgraded the</text>
  <text start="705.38" dur="5.73">bank of england&amp;#39;s rating from AAA + 2</text>
  <text start="707.84" dur="5.85">AAA just to get onto the bandwagon here</text>
  <text start="711.11" dur="4.14">and we know the central bankers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="713.69" dur="5.67">doing whatever they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="715.25" dur="6.03">reverse this entire decision now first</text>
  <text start="719.36" dur="4.08">they came up with this do-over petition</text>
  <text start="721.28" dur="4.71">where they&amp;#39;re saying there&amp;#39;s 3.5 million</text>
  <text start="723.44" dur="4.02">signatories and we can have it do-over</text>
  <text start="725.99" dur="3.48">and of course the corporate media was</text>
  <text start="727.46" dur="3.66">out there saying yes look at this this</text>
  <text start="729.47" dur="3.12">is unbelievable all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="731.12" dur="5.19">people are just rallying together just</text>
  <text start="732.59" dur="8.61">stay with the EU well it turns out this</text>
  <text start="736.31" dur="9.03">is completely fabricated and when we</text>
  <text start="741.2" dur="8.37">look at this we see that a hacker that</text>
  <text start="745.34" dur="8.52">goes by for Chen and someone who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="749.57" dur="9.81">pretending to be anonymous wrote a</text>
  <text start="753.86" dur="10.41">script and basically had these</text>
  <text start="759.38" dur="7.44">signatures inputted into the site so</text>
  <text start="764.27" dur="3.72">they track the IP addresses and they</text>
  <text start="766.82" dur="8.84">were coming from all over the place</text>
  <text start="767.99" dur="9.51">Vietnam ghana Uganda turkey Vatican City</text>
  <text start="775.66" dur="4.81">actually in the vatican city the</text>
  <text start="777.5" dur="5.31">population is 800 and they got thirty</text>
  <text start="780.47" dur="4.98">thousand signatures from their North</text>
  <text start="782.81" dur="5.73">Korea so what what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="785.45" dur="6.15">now is they were bouncing this off of</text>
  <text start="788.54" dur="7.08">all different servers having it go to</text>
  <text start="791.6" dur="6.99">the UK website and try to make it look</text>
  <text start="795.62" dur="6.6">like look all these people are rallying</text>
  <text start="798.59" dur="5.31">together well it didn&amp;#39;t work it turns</text>
  <text start="802.22" dur="6.06">out it is completely fake phony and</text>
  <text start="803.9" dur="6.36">false and right now they have to move on</text>
  <text start="808.28" dur="4.77">to something else so what are they</text>
  <text start="810.26" dur="5.7">moving on to well now they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="813.05" dur="4.92">about protests anti brexit protests and</text>
  <text start="815.96" dur="3.3">we know the central bankers and the</text>
  <text start="817.97" dur="3.06">government&amp;#39;s that are intertwined with</text>
  <text start="819.26" dur="3.87">the central bankers they love getting</text>
  <text start="821.03" dur="5.13">people together and having protests and</text>
  <text start="823.13" dur="6.71">if a peaceful protest doesn&amp;#39;t work what</text>
  <text start="826.16" dur="6.5">do they do well they ramp that up we see</text>
  <text start="829.84" dur="8.2">people starting to</text>
  <text start="832.66" dur="7.479">get a little wild there&amp;#39;s riots and we</text>
  <text start="838.04" dur="4.95">might see this so this is something that</text>
  <text start="840.139" dur="4.68">we really need to look at now the</text>
  <text start="842.99" dur="3.42">European Parliament they&amp;#39;re calling for</text>
  <text start="844.819" dur="4.68">an immediate trigger on the brexit</text>
  <text start="846.41" dur="5.549">protocol and of course as we know the</text>
  <text start="849.499" dur="6.33">Parliament of the UK they need to go</text>
  <text start="851.959" dur="8.07">ahead and push article 50 and they need</text>
  <text start="855.829" dur="6.57">to initiate it but we can see the</text>
  <text start="860.029" dur="4.021">European Parliament they want this done</text>
  <text start="862.399" dur="3.69">very very quickly they&amp;#39;re saying let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="864.05" dur="4.8">just do it let&amp;#39;s just do it now the</text>
  <text start="866.089" dur="5.25">question is why why are they pushing so</text>
  <text start="868.85" dur="4.769">hard to get this done well we have to</text>
  <text start="871.339" dur="6.66">remember this all came out of left field</text>
  <text start="873.619" dur="7.171">they thought the UK was going to remain</text>
  <text start="877.999" dur="7.52">in the EU they thought they had this it</text>
  <text start="880.79" dur="10.519">was already fixed was already done and</text>
  <text start="885.519" dur="8.86">this whole thing they lost control of</text>
  <text start="891.309" dur="6.13">now they&amp;#39;re worried because remember</text>
  <text start="894.379" dur="4.83">they want to bring this economy down the</text>
  <text start="897.439" dur="4.5">way they want it to be brought down they</text>
  <text start="899.209" dur="4.86">have their story they know exactly what</text>
  <text start="901.939" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re going to do step by step who are</text>
  <text start="904.069" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re going to blame this on and if</text>
  <text start="905.959" dur="5.22">the economy comes down now because of</text>
  <text start="908.449" dur="6.841">this this is not going to end well for</text>
  <text start="911.179" dur="7.32">them and we can see right now that David</text>
  <text start="915.29" dur="7.039">Cameron he&amp;#39;s resisting any pressure to</text>
  <text start="918.499" dur="7.02">begin the two-year talks about</text>
  <text start="922.329" dur="5.2">initiating article 50 he says maybe I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="925.519" dur="4.29">just leave it up to the next person that</text>
  <text start="927.529" dur="4.05">comes in and that will be down the line</text>
  <text start="929.809" dur="5.041">now it seems like they&amp;#39;re stalling right</text>
  <text start="931.579" dur="5.82">now and the question is why would they</text>
  <text start="934.85" dur="5.159">stall at this point are they creating</text>
  <text start="937.399" dur="5.37">some type of an event where they can say</text>
  <text start="940.009" dur="5.13">oh look what just happened here the UK</text>
  <text start="942.769" dur="3.81">can&amp;#39;t leave sorry about that people but</text>
  <text start="945.139" dur="4.95">we&amp;#39;re going to have to stay in the EU</text>
  <text start="946.579" dur="5.7">right now and we know as we move further</text>
  <text start="950.089" dur="4.201">and further into this year the collapse</text>
  <text start="952.279" dur="3.451">is comming things are getting worse we</text>
  <text start="954.29" dur="3.419">know they have certain things planned</text>
  <text start="955.73" dur="5.519">and this is something that we need to</text>
  <text start="957.709" dur="6.271">really watch because as this economy</text>
  <text start="961.249" dur="4.351">continually deteriorates and I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="963.98" dur="4.169">this many times we all need to</text>
  <text start="965.6" dur="5.34">be prepared and we can see from just</text>
  <text start="968.149" dur="5.221">going back a year how many things have</text>
  <text start="970.94" dur="4.589">happened already and how much closer we</text>
  <text start="973.37" dur="5.85">are to this collapse but very</text>
  <text start="975.529" dur="6.29">interestingly the US government there</text>
  <text start="979.22" dur="5.94">was a time they told every American to</text>
  <text start="981.819" dur="6.221">stockpile fooled make sure you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="985.16" dur="5.729">prepared make sure you&amp;#39;re reading if you</text>
  <text start="988.04" dur="4.969">go back to the 50s and the 60s the US</text>
  <text start="990.889" dur="4.56">government actually encourage people to</text>
  <text start="993.009" dur="3.971">create fold-out shelters to make sure</text>
  <text start="995.449" dur="7.291">they had water to make sure they had</text>
  <text start="996.98" dur="9.33">food to prepare for a nuclear war now</text>
  <text start="1002.74" dur="6.12">today they are saying that those are the</text>
  <text start="1006.31" dur="4.98">people that are crazy there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="1008.86" dur="3.83">to prepare now remember back then the US</text>
  <text start="1011.29" dur="4.26">government was telling you to do this</text>
  <text start="1012.69" dur="5.68">today they&amp;#39;re not which means</text>
  <text start="1015.55" dur="5.25">something&amp;#39;s going to happen because we</text>
  <text start="1018.37" dur="4.26">do the opposite of what the government</text>
  <text start="1020.8" dur="4.8">tells us if they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="1022.63" dur="4.559">everything&amp;#39;s going to be okay we know</text>
  <text start="1025.6" dur="3.15">right now things are not going to be</text>
  <text start="1027.189" dur="4.23">okay if they tell us in our forecasting</text>
  <text start="1028.75" dur="5.309">any type of recession or crash we know</text>
  <text start="1031.419" dur="5.341">there&amp;#39;s going to be one so we can see</text>
  <text start="1034.059" dur="7.5">right now that since the government is</text>
  <text start="1036.76" dur="6.63">not really out there telling us to make</text>
  <text start="1041.559" dur="5.221">sure that you have stockpiles of food</text>
  <text start="1043.39" dur="5.19">and water they do tell you yeah be</text>
  <text start="1046.78" dur="5.43">prepared maybe for a month or a couple</text>
  <text start="1048.58" dur="6.62">weeks just in case is the storm but for</text>
  <text start="1052.21" dur="5.18">an economic collapse for a World War</text>
  <text start="1055.2" dur="6.55">they&amp;#39;re not going in that direction and</text>
  <text start="1057.39" dur="5.86">this tells us that this is exactly where</text>
  <text start="1061.75" dur="3.929">we&amp;#39;re headed and everyone does need to</text>
  <text start="1063.25" dur="4.83">be prepared and ready because this</text>
  <text start="1065.679" dur="5.671">collapse is coming it&amp;#39;s building right</text>
