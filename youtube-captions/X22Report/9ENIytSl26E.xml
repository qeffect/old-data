  <text start="190.209" dur="6.17">to touch this they don&amp;#39;t want to go near</text>
  <text start="192.43" dur="7.08">it so they&amp;#39;re gonna stick with the</text>
  <text start="196.379" dur="5.58">headline and they&amp;#39;re going to use that</text>
  <text start="199.51" dur="5.61">what is their headline oh yeah</text>

  <text start="205.12" dur="4.5">start the investigation not a big deal</text>
  <text start="207.219" dur="3.6">and there was no biased will be talking</text>
  <text start="209.62" dur="3.479">about that in just a minute but first</text>
  <text start="210.819" dur="5.88">let&amp;#39;s talk about this fake impeachment</text>
  <text start="213.099" dur="7.081">hearing and the Republicans they were</text>
  <text start="216.699" dur="5.701">demanding that they have a hearing day</text>
  <text start="220.18" dur="4.259">now it&amp;#39;s in the rules it&amp;#39;s not that</text>
  <text start="222.4" dur="3.899">Jerry Nadler has to decide shit away</text>
  <text start="224.439" dur="4.95">allow him to do it right not allow him</text>
  <text start="226.299" dur="5.97">to do it it&amp;#39;s in the rules that says the</text>
  <text start="229.389" dur="5.81">Republicans have a right to have a</text>
  <text start="232.269" dur="6.69">hearing day and call their own witnesses</text>
  <text start="235.199" dur="5.861">but Nadler he continually pushes back</text>
  <text start="238.959" dur="4.95">why does Nadler continually push back</text>
  <text start="241.06" dur="4.859">because he knows if they call in their</text>
  <text start="243.909" dur="4.53">own witnesses everything that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="245.919" dur="5.581">been trying to do completely falls apart</text>
  <text start="248.439" dur="5.67">and we had Collins and many different</text>
  <text start="251.5" dur="5.579">Republicans representatives arguing with</text>
  <text start="254.109" dur="5.85">Nadler today and you can see how they</text>
  <text start="257.079" dur="6.751">continually change the rules but there</text>
  <text start="259.959" dur="6.33">are five indisputable facts about this</text>
  <text start="263.83" dur="5.7">fake impeachment Stephanie Griffin</text>
  <text start="266.289" dur="6.991">tweeted out the following no evidence of</text>
  <text start="269.53" dur="6.53">wrongdoing by POTUS Ukraine said there</text>
  <text start="273.28" dur="6.479">was no pressure lethal aid Ukraine</text>
  <text start="276.06" dur="6.729">wouldn&amp;#39;t exist without real Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="279.759" dur="5.761">there&amp;#39;s no obstruction whatsoever this</text>
  <text start="282.789" dur="6.601">is an unfair unprecedented impeachment</text>
  <text start="285.52" dur="6.38">process and she&amp;#39;s absolutely right</text>
  <text start="289.39" dur="6.12">and this is what they&amp;#39;re afraid of and</text>
  <text start="291.9" dur="6.46">this revolves around Ukraine around</text>
  <text start="295.51" dur="6.63">Biden around what Rudy Giuliani has</text>
  <text start="298.36" dur="6.39">found out now Joe Biden is claiming that</text>
  <text start="302.14" dur="4.68">staffers never warned that his youngest</text>
  <text start="304.75" dur="5.28">son&amp;#39;s roll with Purisima Holdings a</text>
  <text start="306.82" dur="7.41">Ukraine natural gas conglomerate posed a</text>
  <text start="310.03" dur="8.37">conflict of interest and this is</text>
  <text start="314.23" dur="7.59">contradicting one of his top advisors so</text>
  <text start="318.4" dur="7.32">Amos Hochstein once a type advisor to</text>
  <text start="321.82" dur="7.02">the former vice president said yeah I</text>
  <text start="325.72" dur="8.46">told him about this back in December of</text>
  <text start="328.84" dur="10.08">2015 and it seems that Biden is lying</text>
  <text start="334.18" dur="7.71">about this and we know that the truth is</text>
  <text start="338.92" dur="7.62">eventually going to come out how do we</text>
  <text start="341.89" dur="7.17">know this we know this because Rudy</text>
  <text start="346.54" dur="6.99">Giuliani is going to present the</text>
  <text start="349.06" dur="6">findings to Congress and Bill Barr Rudy</text>
  <text start="353.53" dur="7.05">Giuliani has been collecting this</text>
  <text start="355.06" dur="7.68">information and Ukraine right now they</text>
  <text start="360.58" dur="6.48">just revealed that they&amp;#39;re working on</text>
  <text start="362.74" dur="9.48">six criminal cases and it involves the</text>
  <text start="367.06" dur="8.34">Biden&amp;#39;s now Jason Miller came out and</text>
  <text start="372.22" dur="5.04">confirmed that Rudy Giuliani is going to</text>
  <text start="375.4" dur="4.29">release this information he tweeted out</text>
  <text start="377.26" dur="4.14">the following report from Rudy Giuliani</text>
  <text start="379.69" dur="4.05">will be likely be a little later than</text>
  <text start="381.4" dur="5.42">Wednesday to be clear but this evidence</text>
  <text start="383.74" dur="5.4">will definitely be put forward soon and</text>
  <text start="386.82" dur="5.71">once he starts to present this evidence</text>
  <text start="389.14" dur="5.63">and hand over the documentation this is</text>
  <text start="392.53" dur="6.12">when things start to really fall apart</text>
  <text start="394.77" dur="8.14">now the mainstream media they are in</text>
  <text start="398.65" dur="6">full spin mode today and they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="402.91" dur="4.56">not digging into the report because</text>
  <text start="404.65" dur="5.22">there is nothing that they really want</text>
  <text start="407.47" dur="4.05">to report on so they&amp;#39;re using the</text>
  <text start="409.87" dur="4.37">high-level headlines to convince</text>
  <text start="411.52" dur="5.13">everyone that this is a nothing burger</text>
  <text start="414.24" dur="5.2">here are some of the headlines from</text>
  <text start="416.65" dur="5.89">Yahoo inspector general finds FBI probe</text>
  <text start="419.44" dur="5.8">into Trump campaign was justified but</text>
  <text start="422.54" dur="4.35">perfect Huffington Post Department of</text>
  <text start="425.24" dur="3.57">Justice watchdog FBI justified in</text>
  <text start="426.89" dur="5.7">opening Trump probe but problems with</text>
  <text start="428.81" dur="6.63">FISA apps CNN report start of Russia</text>
  <text start="432.59" dur="7.98">probe was justified but had significant</text>
  <text start="435.44" dur="7.62">errors really just errors that it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="440.57" dur="5.01">perfect well let&amp;#39;s go through some of it</text>
  <text start="443.06" dur="4.08">and there&amp;#39;s a lot of pages and each day</text>
  <text start="445.58" dur="3.18">we&amp;#39;re gonna go through a lot more</text>
  <text start="447.14" dur="5.73">because there&amp;#39;s a lot to cover and</text>
  <text start="448.76" dur="6.63">there&amp;#39;s a lot of juicy information so</text>
  <text start="452.87" dur="5.07">the mainstream media they&amp;#39;re pushing two</text>
  <text start="455.39" dur="6.42">narratives opening the probe was</text>
  <text start="457.94" dur="6.24">justified and there was no bias so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="461.81" dur="6.35">go with the first so let&amp;#39;s think about</text>
  <text start="464.18" dur="9.39">this that the probe was justified</text>
  <text start="468.16" dur="9.25">logical thinking so if the FBI started a</text>
  <text start="473.57" dur="6.63">probe and they found out that they</text>
  <text start="477.41" dur="4.2">really didn&amp;#39;t have anything they should</text>
  <text start="480.2" dur="5.34">have stopped the probe right there and</text>
  <text start="481.61" dur="7.98">then because all they needed to start</text>
  <text start="485.54" dur="6.66">the probe was some other foreign</text>
  <text start="489.59" dur="4.08">government saying that ooh we found</text>
  <text start="492.2" dur="3.99">something and yes they could have</text>
  <text start="493.67" dur="5.22">started a probe but is this really how</text>
  <text start="496.19" dur="5.82">they started Durham is telling us</text>
  <text start="498.89" dur="5.49">otherwise he doesn&amp;#39;t agree with the IG</text>
  <text start="502.01" dur="6.57">Pfizer report remember the IG Pfizer</text>
  <text start="504.38" dur="7.92">report doesn&amp;#39;t go into intent it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="508.58" dur="5.31">explain why they started Durham is gonna</text>
  <text start="512.3" dur="4.23">let us know that we&amp;#39;ll talk about that</text>
  <text start="513.89" dur="6.089">in a little bit but they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="516.53" dur="6.389">about how they were justified in doing</text>
  <text start="519.979" dur="7.201">this and that the the report showed that</text>
  <text start="522.919" dur="7.741">there was really nothing there but when</text>
  <text start="527.18" dur="7.35">we look at the report we see that the</text>
  <text start="530.66" dur="7.14">FBI withheld exculpatory evidence to get</text>
  <text start="534.53" dur="5.31">the FISA warrants and Durham he put out</text>
  <text start="537.8" dur="4.35">a statement today this is what he said I</text>
  <text start="539.84" dur="3.9">have the utmost respect for the mission</text>
  <text start="542.15" dur="3.84">of the Office of Inspector General and</text>

  <text start="566.98" dur="2.46">ongoing</text>
  <text start="567.49" dur="4.14">last month we advise the Inspector</text>
  <text start="569.44" dur="4.56">General that we do not agree with some</text>
  <text start="571.63" dur="5.52">of the reports conclusions as to the</text>
  <text start="574" dur="4.89">predication and how the FBI case was</text>
  <text start="577.15" dur="4.86">open which we&amp;#39;ll be getting into a</text>
  <text start="578.89" dur="5.91">little bit from now so now as we know</text>
  <text start="582.01" dur="5.04">the IG report has been released and with</text>
  <text start="584.8" dur="4.62">it we get a couple of QED proofs here</text>

  <text start="589.42" dur="6.72">account posted the IgE the IG Pfizer</text>
  <text start="592.54" dur="7.32">report at 129 Eastern Standard Time</text>
  <text start="596.14" dur="5.76">now if we go back to post 636 42 there</text>
  <text start="599.86" dur="8.51">was a picture of a watch and the watch</text>
  <text start="601.9" dur="9.9">said 1:29 coincidence I don&amp;#39;t think so</text>
  <text start="608.37" dur="5.47">so the report was posted at that time</text>
  <text start="611.8" dur="4.23">and we have another QED proof which</text>
  <text start="613.84" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;ll talk about in a couple minutes but</text>
  <text start="616.03" dur="3.6">first let&amp;#39;s start off with Devin Nunez</text>
  <text start="617.53" dur="3.87">he tweeted out the following American</text>

  <text start="2060.21" dur="6.18">people Horowitz didn&amp;#39;t do that he was</text>
  <text start="2063.51" dur="6.57">just looking at the violations people</text>
  <text start="2066.39" dur="6.9">are going to be held accountable now</text>
  <text start="2070.08" dur="5.91">this is very important the IG could not</text>
  <text start="2073.29" dur="5.1">determine the intention or justification</text>
  <text start="2075.99" dur="6.419">for the blatant abuse of the FISA</text>
  <text start="2078.39" dur="7.35">process this then leads us to why Durham</text>
  <text start="2082.409" dur="6">needed to make this statement today he</text>
  <text start="2085.74" dur="6.98">has that part he will bring that part</text>
  <text start="2088.409" dur="9.511">out of the darkness and into the light</text>
  <text start="2092.72" dur="10.41">this is the conclusion of IG that the</text>
  <text start="2097.92" dur="8.81">FISA Court was misled AG bar says report</text>
  <text start="2103.13" dur="6.61">substantiates clear abuse of FISA</text>
  <text start="2106.73" dur="5.47">process and when you go through this</text>
  <text start="2109.74" dur="3.84">report and remember we only scratched</text>
  <text start="2112.2" dur="3.63">the surface it only came out today</text>
  <text start="2113.58" dur="4.59">people are going through this I mean the</text>
  <text start="2115.83" dur="4.02">digital soldiers they&amp;#39;re going through</text>
  <text start="2118.17" dur="3.96">this with a fine-tooth comb</text>
  <text start="2119.85" dur="5.1">looking at the footnotes looking at each</text>
  <text start="2122.13" dur="5.7">section and when you really start to put</text>
  <text start="2124.95" dur="6.27">it all together you can see why this</text>
  <text start="2127.83" dur="6.78">report was needed because this is the</text>
  <text start="2131.22" dur="7.59">foundation this shows the violations</text>
  <text start="2134.61" dur="6.81">now derm is going to give the why Durham</text>
  <text start="2138.81" dur="5.58">is going to show the criminality that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2141.42" dur="5.88">his job remember he&amp;#39;s been speaking to</text>
  <text start="2144.39" dur="5.34">people all around the world he knows</text>
  <text start="2147.3" dur="6.75">their plan this is why he doesn&amp;#39;t agree</text>
  <text start="2149.73" dur="7.56">with Horowitz because he has the rest of</text>
  <text start="2154.05" dur="4.77">the information he understands the</text>
  <text start="2157.29" dur="4.08">bigger picture</text>
  <text start="2158.82" dur="7.31">and he&amp;#39;s putting together all the pieces</text>
  <text start="2161.37" dur="6.96">remember this was compartmentalised</text>
  <text start="2166.13" dur="4.81">Horowitz doesn&amp;#39;t know anything that</text>
  <text start="2168.33" dur="5.31">Durham&amp;#39;s doing Durham knows it all and</text>
  <text start="2170.94" dur="5.55">he sees all the pieces and he&amp;#39;s putting</text>
  <text start="2173.64" dur="5.91">it all together and this is why this was</text>
  <text start="2176.49" dur="6.12">so important to just focus on the</text>
  <text start="2179.55" dur="5.34">violations to show how they manipulated</text>
  <text start="2182.61" dur="5.25">the system and how they kept exculpatory</text>
  <text start="2184.89" dur="4.46">information from the courts this is very</text>
  <text start="2187.86" dur="5.4">important didn&amp;#39;t they do this with Flynn</text>
  <text start="2189.35" dur="6.31">didn&amp;#39;t the DOJ hold back information</text>
  <text start="2193.26" dur="3.15">that would have shown that Flynn was</text>
  <text start="2195.66" dur="5.49">innocent</text>
  <text start="2196.41" dur="6.81">ah now take that same logic and apply it</text>
  <text start="2201.15" dur="4.92">to the FBI didn&amp;#39;t they hold back</text>
  <text start="2203.22" dur="6.06">information that would show the FISA</text>
  <text start="2206.07" dur="6.15">courts that the information that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2209.28" dur="7.65">presenting was not cooperated that there</text>
  <text start="2212.22" dur="7.23">should be no warrant ah yes see how this</text>
  <text start="2216.93" dur="4.89">is all coming together and now Durham is</text>
  <text start="2219.45" dur="6.53">going to take all of it and show</text>
  <text start="2221.82" dur="8.31">everyone the criminality aspect of it</text>
