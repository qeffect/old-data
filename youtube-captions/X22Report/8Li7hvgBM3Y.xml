  <text start="51.91" dur="5.43">need to report my name is Dave and this</text>
  <text start="53.56" dur="6.66">is episode 1266 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="57.34" dur="6.06">April 28th 2017 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="60.22" dur="6.42">episode is the Fed goes all in to crash</text>
  <text start="63.4" dur="6.42">the economy let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="66.64" dur="5.88">collapse financial news now we know the</text>
  <text start="69.82" dur="5.52">central bankers they have been pushing</text>
  <text start="72.52" dur="5.88">their agenda for many many years</text>
  <text start="75.34" dur="6.66">actually since 1913 but it is</text>
  <text start="78.4" dur="6.9">accelerated since 2008 but they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="82" dur="4.89">trucking along since 1971 when we came</text>
  <text start="85.3" dur="4.2">off the gold standard and this is where</text>
  <text start="86.89" dur="6.21">they really pushed their agenda</text>
  <text start="89.5" dur="6.78">throughout the years and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="93.1" dur="4.59">seeing right now is they have certain</text>
  <text start="96.28" dur="4.68">goals they want to reach they want to</text>
  <text start="97.69" dur="5.28">reach this cashless society and this</text>
  <text start="100.96" dur="5.01">makes it better for them because they</text>
  <text start="102.97" dur="6.12">have full control of your currency then</text>
  <text start="105.97" dur="4.02">you can&amp;#39;t hide the cash you can&amp;#39;t hide</text>
  <text start="109.09" dur="4.41">the coins</text>
  <text start="109.99" dur="5.1">you can&amp;#39;t hide all this stuff because</text>
  <text start="113.5" dur="4.34">everything&amp;#39;s electronic in the bank</text>
  <text start="115.09" dur="6.87">under the control of the central bank</text>
  <text start="117.84" dur="8.46">now we can see that there are countries</text>
  <text start="121.96" dur="7.079">right now moving in this direction India</text>
  <text start="126.3" dur="4.93">Europe would like to do this the United</text>
  <text start="129.039" dur="3.481">States would like to do this and many</text>
  <text start="131.23" dur="3.27">other countries are going to jump on</text>
  <text start="132.52" dur="4.92">board if the central bankers get their</text>
  <text start="134.5" dur="5.7">way and we can see that South Korea</text>
  <text start="137.44" dur="5.58">right now they are actually heading in</text>
  <text start="140.2" dur="5.13">this direction and they&amp;#39;re already among</text>
  <text start="143.02" dur="4.97">the least cash dependant countries in</text>
  <text start="145.33" dur="6.72">the world and they started a trial</text>
  <text start="147.99" dur="6.43">phase-out of coins and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="152.05" dur="5.31">get rid of all coins now instead of</text>
  <text start="154.42" dur="4.26">making change and giving you coins what</text>
  <text start="157.36" dur="4.349">they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="158.68" dur="6.21">have a prepaid card so if you get change</text>
  <text start="161.709" dur="5.491">it goes on to this prepaid card and then</text>
  <text start="164.89" dur="3.569">you use that and eventually what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="167.2" dur="3.32">to happen is they&amp;#39;ll get rid of the</text>
  <text start="168.459" dur="5.25">paper money and everything will be just</text>
  <text start="170.52" dur="5.2">credit debit and however else they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="173.709" dur="4.23">going to do it but for the interim</text>
  <text start="175.72" dur="4.379">portion of this going into a cashless</text>
  <text start="177.939" dur="4.301">society they&amp;#39;re going to be using a</text>
  <text start="180.099" dur="5.471">prepaid card and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised</text>
  <text start="182.24" dur="5.31">if other countries follow suit and they</text>
  <text start="185.57" dur="5.1">do the same exact thing because we know</text>
  <text start="187.55" dur="5.87">the central bankers goal is to have a</text>
  <text start="190.67" dur="6.24">Cancer Society to take control of</text>
  <text start="193.42" dur="8.59">everyone&amp;#39;s accounts and to basically</text>
  <text start="196.91" dur="6.99">control track the everyday person that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="202.01" dur="5.97">the main objective to all this because</text>
  <text start="203.9" dur="7.2">in the end the central bankers and this</text>
  <text start="207.98" dur="5.52">is the Rothschild bank this is the Bank</text>
  <text start="211.1" dur="3.99">of International Settlements and most of</text>
  <text start="213.5" dur="4.11">the countries do have central banks</text>
  <text start="215.09" dur="4.05">today some have the and I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="217.61" dur="3.66">about the private western central bank</text>
  <text start="219.14" dur="4.62">let&amp;#39;s not be confused here others have</text>
  <text start="221.27" dur="5.28">central banks where the people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="223.76" dur="4.77">government control it like in Russia it</text>
  <text start="226.55" dur="4.71">was a private west central bank where</text>
  <text start="228.53" dur="5.07">the Rothschilds did control it Putin</text>
  <text start="231.26" dur="5.13">came in and actually took control of</text>
  <text start="233.6" dur="6.51">that central bank and he calls the shots</text>
  <text start="236.39" dur="6.45">in Russia we can see do-dirty he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="240.11" dur="4.44">getting ready to get rid of the central</text>
  <text start="242.84" dur="4.11">bank there that&amp;#39;s run by the Rothschild</text>
  <text start="244.55" dur="5.1">we see Hungary the same thing they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="246.95" dur="4.14">gotten rid of their central bank that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="249.65" dur="3.75">run by the Rothschild</text>
  <text start="251.09" dur="5.7">Iceland has taken control and actually</text>
  <text start="253.4" dur="7.29">jailed bankers for their complete mess</text>
  <text start="256.79" dur="6.69">in 2008 and most of the countries today</text>
  <text start="260.69" dur="5.55">yes they do have a private western</text>
  <text start="263.48" dur="5.16">central bank run by the Rothschild bank</text>
  <text start="266.24" dur="4.23">and this is something that we need to</text>
  <text start="268.64" dur="4.05">break apart this is something that we</text>
  <text start="270.47" dur="6.12">need to get rid of here in the United</text>
  <text start="272.69" dur="7.14">States and this is what we need to focus</text>
  <text start="276.59" dur="6.24">on because the central bank this is the</text>
  <text start="279.83" dur="5.28">major problem of all our problems when</text>
  <text start="282.83" dur="4.47">it comes down to what is happening with</text>
  <text start="285.11" dur="6.63">the monetary system all the way through</text>
  <text start="287.3" dur="6.87">to war now here in the United States we</text>
  <text start="291.74" dur="5.07">see that this central banking system it</text>
  <text start="294.17" dur="4.98">is completely deteriorating it&amp;#39;s falling</text>
  <text start="296.81" dur="5.15">apart it&amp;#39;s accelerating and every time</text>
  <text start="299.15" dur="7.86">we report on this we see things rapidly</text>
  <text start="301.96" dur="6.79">getting worse and worse and worse but we</text>
  <text start="307.01" dur="4.14">can see that they&amp;#39;re continually trying</text>
  <text start="308.75" dur="4.11">to make it seem like everything well</text>
  <text start="311.15" dur="4.31">it&amp;#39;s still chugging along and they come</text>
  <text start="312.86" dur="3.98">out with their consumer confidence</text>
  <text start="315.46" dur="2.64">and they say everything is fine and</text>
  <text start="316.84" dur="2.46">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that every</text>
  <text start="318.1" dur="3.63">time they come out with consumer</text>
  <text start="319.3" dur="4.62">confidence they tell you that the</text>
  <text start="321.73" dur="4.44">consumers are feeling good everything</text>
  <text start="323.92" dur="4.86">looks great but when you really look at</text>
  <text start="326.17" dur="5.07">what&amp;#39;s going on you see real wage growth</text>
  <text start="328.78" dur="5.79">well that is declined over the years</text>
  <text start="331.24" dur="6.51">people are making less now people are</text>
  <text start="334.57" dur="5.52">spending less now stores are closing</text>
  <text start="337.75" dur="8.06">people are losing their part-time and</text>
  <text start="340.09" dur="9.3">full-time jobs GDP is in the dumper and</text>
  <text start="345.81" dur="7">how can everyone say that consumer</text>
  <text start="349.39" dur="5.46">confidence is holding steady or moving</text>
  <text start="352.81" dur="3.48">up at this point it&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="354.85" dur="3.75">ridiculous when you come to think about</text>
  <text start="356.29" dur="4.05">it it doesn&amp;#39;t even make sense</text>
  <text start="358.6" dur="4.29">especially when you see corporate</text>
  <text start="360.34" dur="5.45">defaults when we see credit card</text>
  <text start="362.89" dur="5.55">defaults on the rise more people putting</text>
  <text start="365.79" dur="4.81">expenses on credit cards because they</text>
  <text start="368.44" dur="4.44">just don&amp;#39;t have the cash because they</text>
  <text start="370.6" dur="4.41">don&amp;#39;t have the jobs so when we look at</text>
  <text start="372.88" dur="4.2">this we can see that what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="375.01" dur="4.2">putting out there makes no sense</text>
  <text start="377.08" dur="3.96">whatsoever and the stock market keeps</text>
  <text start="379.21" dur="3.93">going higher and higher and higher and</text>
  <text start="381.04" dur="5.19">we can tell that this is all completely</text>
  <text start="383.14" dur="4.89">manipulated to keep us in this illusion</text>
  <text start="386.23" dur="5.61">and we&amp;#39;ve been kept in this illusion for</text>
  <text start="388.03" dur="8.39">a very long time and this illusion it is</text>
  <text start="391.84" dur="9.21">dying right now and we understand that</text>
  <text start="396.42" dur="7.45">70% of GDP is made up of US consumer</text>
  <text start="401.05" dur="5.97">spending and we are continually seeing</text>
  <text start="403.87" dur="6.99">spending decline over time it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="407.02" dur="7.47">moving up it&amp;#39;s not getting better</text>
  <text start="410.86" dur="6.21">it&amp;#39;s actually declining and US consumer</text>
  <text start="414.49" dur="5.55">spending is at point two three percent</text>
  <text start="417.07" dur="8.55">annualized this was the worst print</text>
  <text start="420.04" dur="8.82">going back to 2009 and according to beas</text>
  <text start="425.62" dur="5.88">gold sikh models even as retail sales</text>
  <text start="428.86" dur="5.73">have tumbled as Obamacare continued to</text>
  <text start="431.5" dur="7.55">drain disposable income people did spend</text>
  <text start="434.59" dur="8.82">their funds on something and that was</text>
  <text start="439.05" dur="7.78">recreational vehicles now they spent</text>
  <text start="443.41" dur="4.87">less on cars less on clothing less on</text>
  <text start="446.83" dur="4.24">housing and</text>
  <text start="448.28" dur="6.18">spent more on recreational goods and</text>
  <text start="451.07" dur="8.76">vehicles which falls into the category</text>
  <text start="454.46" dur="8.28">of weapons RVs camping equipment and you</text>
  <text start="459.83" dur="5.43">start to wonder are they doing this</text>
  <text start="462.74" dur="6.03">because they understand what is going on</text>
  <text start="465.26" dur="5.28">they understand that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="468.77" dur="3.99">need to be on the move</text>
  <text start="470.54" dur="4.98">that they&amp;#39;re going to need a weapon</text>
  <text start="472.76" dur="5.3">they&amp;#39;re going to need supplies when</text>
  <text start="475.52" dur="6.54">things start to really fall apart and</text>
  <text start="478.06" dur="7.33">the last time spending on recreational</text>
  <text start="482.06" dur="8.19">vehicles and goods went up like this was</text>
  <text start="485.39" dur="8.1">last year at this time and last year</text>
  <text start="490.25" dur="4.89">they knew that the economy really wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="493.49" dur="3.54">doing well we were being lied to</text>
  <text start="495.14" dur="3.57">jobs weren&amp;#39;t coming back we were</text>
  <text start="497.03" dur="6.42">continually losing jobs and people were</text>
  <text start="498.71" dur="8.37">preparing for the worst today with Trump</text>
  <text start="503.45" dur="6.6">in the presidency people are still</text>
  <text start="507.08" dur="6.06">feeling the same way where nothing is</text>
  <text start="510.05" dur="6.03">improved jobs aren&amp;#39;t coming back and</text>
  <text start="513.14" dur="5.85">we&amp;#39;re headed towards a huge financial</text>
  <text start="516.08" dur="5.009">crisis now the Atlanta Fed was</text>
  <text start="518.99" dur="4.26">continually putting out their estimates</text>
  <text start="521.089" dur="5.161">over time and they went from all the way</text>
  <text start="523.25" dur="6.87">from 3% all the way down to point what</text>
  <text start="526.25" dur="6.03">was a 2.2 percent or so and the final</text>
  <text start="530.12" dur="6">numbers came in and most likely these</text>
  <text start="532.28" dur="7.47">will be revised lower the final GDP</text>
  <text start="536.12" dur="7.65">number came in around 0.7 percent down</text>
  <text start="539.75" dur="6.6">from 2.1 in the last quarter and of</text>
  <text start="543.77" dur="3.84">course below the expected 1% which they</text>
  <text start="546.35" dur="4.65">thought they were going to get now</text>
  <text start="547.61" dur="6.18">remember this is the manipulated number</text>
  <text start="551" dur="6.99">that the government is putting out there</text>
  <text start="553.79" dur="5.82">and if you look at shadow stats or any</text>
  <text start="557.99" dur="3.45">other calculation besides the</text>
  <text start="559.61" dur="4.56">government&amp;#39;s calculation you can see</text>
  <text start="561.44" dur="5.22">that the GDP numbers are in the negative</text>
  <text start="564.17" dur="6.75">range they&amp;#39;re not in the positive range</text>
  <text start="566.66" dur="7.62">this is the collapse of the system now</text>
  <text start="570.92" dur="5.85">the Fed does believe that things are</text>
  <text start="574.28" dur="5.22">going to improve throughout this year</text>
  <text start="576.77" dur="3.8">and they think that things are going to</text>
  <text start="579.5" dur="3.17">get better</text>
  <text start="580.57" dur="5.52">and they think that we&amp;#39;re going to hit</text>
  <text start="582.67" dur="9.48">the target of a great GDP number of</text>
  <text start="586.09" dur="8.04">maybe 2.8 percent or so which is hard to</text>
  <text start="592.15" dur="4.2">believe because what is going to change</text>
  <text start="594.13" dur="5.64">in the next quarter</text>
  <text start="596.35" dur="7.05">are re all of a sudden going to see</text>
  <text start="599.77" dur="5.22">people spend like crazy retail stores</text>
  <text start="603.4" dur="6.69">are going to start to open up instead of</text>
  <text start="604.99" dur="11.4">closed down because remember 70% of GDP</text>
  <text start="610.09" dur="7.95">is you u.s. consumer spending so how is</text>
  <text start="616.39" dur="3.84">this going to change in the second</text>
  <text start="618.04" dur="5.04">quarter in the third quarter in the</text>
  <text start="620.23" dur="5.57">fourth quarter because as we are seeing</text>
  <text start="623.08" dur="5.88">right now as healthcare premiums go up</text>
  <text start="625.8" dur="4.93">this is included in the spending more</text>
  <text start="628.96" dur="5.12">and more individuals are taking the tax</text>
  <text start="630.73" dur="7.23">penalty instead of purchasing insurance</text>
  <text start="634.08" dur="6.19">so that plus people not actually</text>
  <text start="637.96" dur="4.77">spending in retail we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="640.27" dur="4.83">these numbers drop even further so what</text>
  <text start="642.73" dur="6.24">the Fed is telling us doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="645.1" dur="6.6">make that much sense at all now we can</text>
  <text start="648.97" dur="5.1">see that the government well they on</text>
  <text start="651.7" dur="4.79">they are on the precipice of shutting</text>
  <text start="654.07" dur="5.61">down but don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="656.49" dur="5.38">Congress figured out a way to keep the</text>
  <text start="659.68" dur="4.62">government open and we talked about the</text>
  <text start="661.87" dur="5.7">government shutdown yesterday it really</text>
  <text start="664.3" dur="6">means absolutely nothing it&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="667.57" dur="6.48">they use to scare the American people</text>
  <text start="670.3" dur="6.15">into doing what they want so Congress</text>
  <text start="674.05" dur="6.63">decided to pass this stopgap spending</text>
  <text start="676.45" dur="6.99">bill for seven days and it goes to the</text>
  <text start="680.68" dur="6.12">President&amp;#39;s desk and most likely he will</text>
  <text start="683.44" dur="4.83">sign it and we can see that we&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="686.8" dur="3.36">going to come up with the same exact</text>
  <text start="688.27" dur="3.87">problem where they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="690.16" dur="4.89">debate about keeping the government open</text>
  <text start="692.14" dur="4.14">and if it does shut down it will</text>
  <text start="695.05" dur="4.29">probably just be shut down for a little</text>
  <text start="696.28" dur="6.99">while we&amp;#39;ll have to see if Trump uses</text>
  <text start="699.34" dur="9.57">the same tactics as Obama to prove his</text>
  <text start="703.27" dur="8.43">point where he had the federal employees</text>
  <text start="708.91" dur="4.43">bring out those gates put him in front</text>
  <text start="711.7" dur="3.5">of monuments shut</text>
  <text start="713.34" dur="5.1">things down to make it look really good</text>
  <text start="715.2" dur="6.3">while everyone kept their limousines</text>
  <text start="718.44" dur="4.77">there are private jets and everything</text>
  <text start="721.5" dur="4.02">else their restaurant the golf course</text>
  <text start="723.21" dur="4.11">and everything else they have and of</text>
  <text start="725.52" dur="2.82">course that was done on purpose to make</text>
  <text start="727.32" dur="2.91">everyone see that</text>
  <text start="728.34" dur="5.61">this is what happens when the government</text>
  <text start="730.23" dur="6.93">shuts down and of course this was a dog</text>
  <text start="733.95" dur="5.49">and pony show and really when the</text>

  <text start="739.44" dur="3.72">even notice it it shut down many many</text>
  <text start="741.57" dur="4.89">times in the past which we discussed</text>
  <text start="743.16" dur="7.47">yesterday now the Fed is looking at this</text>
  <text start="746.46" dur="7.82">entire economy and they have just</text>
  <text start="750.63" dur="6.12">signaled that they are not going to stop</text>
  <text start="754.28" dur="6.03">raising interest rates they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="756.75" dur="6.12">if GDP is at 0.7% point two percent</text>
  <text start="760.31" dur="4.87">negative point five percent it makes no</text>
  <text start="762.87" dur="4.59">difference because their models show</text>
  <text start="765.18" dur="4.83">that the economy is going to improve</text>
  <text start="767.46" dur="4.77">this is just temporary and we are going</text>
  <text start="770.01" dur="6.45">to raise rates rapidly throughout this</text>
  <text start="772.23" dur="6.87">year and this is coming from the Federal</text>
  <text start="776.46" dur="5.97">Reserve and they&amp;#39;re saying that they</text>
  <text start="779.1" dur="5.94">expect in the second quarter and they</text>
  <text start="782.43" dur="3.84">might get it they expect 2.8 percent now</text>
  <text start="785.04" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;ll probably get this if they</text>
  <text start="786.27" dur="4.35">manipulate the numbers but this is what</text>
  <text start="788.4" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re expecting and it&amp;#39;s even going to</text>
  <text start="790.62" dur="4.11">get better as we go throughout this year</text>
  <text start="792.99" dur="4.77">and this is why we can raise interest</text>
  <text start="794.73" dur="3.33">rates what they&amp;#39;re really doing right</text>
  <text start="797.76" dur="5.37">now</text>
  <text start="798.06" dur="6.27">and go back to 2008 go back before that</text>
  <text start="803.13" dur="3.15">when they started to raise interest</text>
  <text start="804.33" dur="3.51">rates where they told you that</text>
  <text start="806.28" dur="2.97">everything was fine even though the</text>
  <text start="807.84" dur="3.24">subprime securities they were complete</text>
  <text start="809.25" dur="3.51">garbage even though the rated triple-a</text>
  <text start="811.08" dur="3">and they started to raise interest rates</text>
  <text start="812.76" dur="3.45">saying say the economy is fine</text>
  <text start="814.08" dur="3.96">everything&amp;#39;s back on track we have the</text>
  <text start="816.21" dur="3.48">subprime securities the triple-a people</text>
  <text start="818.04" dur="3.6">are buying houses this is why we can</text>
  <text start="819.69" dur="3.96">raise rates right now even when things</text>
  <text start="821.64" dur="4.5">were falling apart they told you that</text>
  <text start="823.65" dur="8.16">everything was contained that this is</text>
  <text start="826.14" dur="7.17">going to turn out ok for everyone we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="831.81" dur="3.69">not even forecasting any type of</text>
  <text start="833.31" dur="5.13">recession this is what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="835.5" dur="5.46">right now they know this economy is done</text>
  <text start="838.44" dur="6.51">and what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="840.96" dur="5.97">all-in and they&amp;#39;re pushing the agenda to</text>
  <text start="844.95" dur="2.16">shut the system down now I said this in</text>
  <text start="846.93" dur="4.02">a</text>
  <text start="847.11" dur="6.33">fast this is a race on who&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="850.95" dur="5.46">crash the economy and who is going to</text>
  <text start="853.44" dur="4.1">tell the story of who is to blame for</text>
  <text start="856.41" dur="3.75">this</text>
  <text start="857.54" dur="5.2">because Trump&amp;#39;s mission right now which</text>
  <text start="860.16" dur="5.31">I do believe is to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="862.74" dur="6.18">Federal Reserve what other reason would</text>
  <text start="865.47" dur="5.91">he hang up Andrew Jackson in the White</text>
  <text start="868.92" dur="5.76">House because Andrew Jackson campaigned</text>
  <text start="871.38" dur="6.72">on getting rid of the central banking</text>
  <text start="874.68" dur="8.25">system which he did and yes they tried</text>
  <text start="878.1" dur="8.01">to assassinate him which failed and we</text>
  <text start="882.93" dur="7.23">can see right now that as we move</text>
  <text start="886.11" dur="6.479">forward throughout this year the Fed is</text>
  <text start="890.16" dur="6">going to accelerate their plans to crash</text>
  <text start="892.589" dur="7.771">the system Trump most likely is going to</text>
  <text start="896.16" dur="7.26">do the same and this is a race now there</text>
  <text start="900.36" dur="5.61">is no question that this system is going</text>
  <text start="903.42" dur="5.099">to come down it&amp;#39;s not going to improve</text>
  <text start="905.97" dur="3.6">and as we&amp;#39;ve been tracking it and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="908.519" dur="4.411">been looking at everything that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="909.57" dur="5.82">going on the only thing that has kind of</text>
  <text start="912.93" dur="6.06">improved and it looks like it&amp;#39;s improved</text>
  <text start="915.39" dur="5.67">is the stock market moving up but when</text>
  <text start="918.99" dur="4.43">we talk about retail and we talk about</text>
  <text start="921.06" dur="6.36">everything else these are all bubbles</text>
  <text start="923.42" dur="5.979">housing it&amp;#39;s a bubble student loan it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="927.42" dur="3.599">a bubble autos it&amp;#39;s a bubble stock</text>
  <text start="929.399" dur="5.25">market it&amp;#39;s a bubble bond it&amp;#39;s a bubble</text>
  <text start="931.019" dur="6.241">and the race is on to blow these bubbles</text>
  <text start="934.649" dur="9.241">up as fast as they possibly can so they</text>
  <text start="937.26" dur="11.75">can pop and when they do pop it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="943.89" dur="9.72">to be a nightmare situation no matter</text>
  <text start="949.01" dur="7.72">who brings the economy down because when</text>
  <text start="953.61" dur="4.919">the economy comes down it doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="956.73" dur="3.599">if it&amp;#39;s the central bank or if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="958.529" dur="5.521">Trump because the situation is is</text>
  <text start="960.329" dur="6.331">exactly the same everyone is going to</text>
  <text start="964.05" dur="6.93">most likely lose their job lose their</text>
  <text start="966.66" dur="6.96">life savings lose their pension food is</text>
  <text start="970.98" dur="4.01">going to be hard to get currency is</text>
  <text start="973.62" dur="5.67">going to be worthless</text>
  <text start="974.99" dur="5.44">the only difference there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="979.29" dur="3.45">between the</text>
  <text start="980.43" dur="6.69">central bank and Trump bringing down the</text>
  <text start="982.74" dur="8.73">system is how its brought back up how we</text>
