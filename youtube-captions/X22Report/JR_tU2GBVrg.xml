  <text start="76.11" dur="4.92">like to keep everyone confused and this</text>
  <text start="78.6" dur="4.62">is why over the many many years they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="81.03" dur="3.51">been suppressing precious metals they</text>
  <text start="83.22" dur="2.94">want they don&amp;#39;t want people to pick up</text>
  <text start="84.54" dur="4.71">that hey you know something</text>
  <text start="86.16" dur="4.5">gold silver this is real money the paper</text>
  <text start="89.25" dur="4.17">currency that we&amp;#39;re printing out of thin</text>
  <text start="90.66" dur="4.44">air it&amp;#39;s absolutely worthless and if you</text>
  <text start="93.42" dur="4.14">ever notice the central banks they</text>
  <text start="95.1" dur="7.379">create the currencies they put countries</text>
  <text start="97.56" dur="8.76">into debt they buy up all their hard</text>
  <text start="102.479" dur="6.331">assets pennies on the dollar when their</text>
  <text start="106.32" dur="4.53">system starts to implode because they</text>
  <text start="108.81" dur="4.26">want the hard assets they don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="110.85" dur="5.49">paper money it&amp;#39;s meaningless to them and</text>
  <text start="113.07" dur="6.9">they know it but they use it as leverage</text>
  <text start="116.34" dur="6.089">to get the hard assets this is how they</text>
  <text start="119.97" dur="5.13">work everything now with precious metals</text>
  <text start="122.429" dur="6.961">or crypto currencies anything that</text>
  <text start="125.1" dur="6.69">challenges their paper dollar well they</text>
  <text start="129.39" dur="4.11">have to demonize it and of course with</text>
  <text start="131.79" dur="2.91">crypto currencies they&amp;#39;ve been out there</text>
  <text start="133.5" dur="3.06">and they&amp;#39;ve been saying you know</text>
  <text start="134.7" dur="4.17">criminals use it it&amp;#39;s for money</text>
  <text start="136.56" dur="4.86">laundering but when you really look at</text>
  <text start="138.87" dur="5.55">what the banks have been doing like HSBC</text>
  <text start="141.42" dur="5.19">and Danske Bank we see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="144.42" dur="4.47">caught up in money laundering Wells</text>
  <text start="146.61" dur="5.73">Fargo they&amp;#39;re caught up in changing</text>
  <text start="148.89" dur="5.91">documentation and we see that dance Bank</text>
  <text start="152.34" dur="4.44">right now well they&amp;#39;re in a little bit</text>
  <text start="154.8" dur="4.56">of trouble what type of trouble well</text>
  <text start="156.78" dur="4.709">they&amp;#39;ve been caught laundering money how</text>
  <text start="159.36" dur="3.84">much have they laundered well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="161.489" dur="4.651">estimated that they laundered about two</text>
  <text start="163.2" dur="4.58">hundred billion euros which is about two</text>
  <text start="166.14" dur="5.429">hundred and thirty four billion dollars</text>
  <text start="167.78" dur="6.37">now to put all of this in context that</text>
  <text start="171.569" dur="3.78">means that&amp;#39;s many times the roughly</text>
  <text start="174.15" dur="4.08">seventeen billion that flows through</text>
  <text start="175.349" dur="5.78">Estonia banks during an average year</text>
  <text start="178.23" dur="5.369">meaning that the money-laundering</text>
  <text start="181.129" dur="4.241">perpetrated by dansk effectively</text>
  <text start="183.599" dur="3.331">transformed the estonia banking system</text>
  <text start="185.37" dur="4.009">into a giant</text>
  <text start="186.93" dur="5.639">front for organized crime groups and</text>
  <text start="189.379" dur="4.511">these individuals didn&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="192.569" dur="2.881">they were investigations that were</text>
  <text start="193.89" dur="4.53">internal there were investigations that</text>
  <text start="195.45" dur="7.05">were external and nothing was done now</text>
  <text start="198.42" dur="6.84">we see that dansk CEO Thomas Morgan has</text>
  <text start="202.5" dur="5.819">decided to step down because why they</text>
  <text start="205.26" dur="4.649">needed a sacrificial lamb to take the</text>
  <text start="208.319" dur="3.661">blame for all of this and of course as</text>
  <text start="209.909" dur="4.23">CEO he should have known what was going</text>
  <text start="211.98" dur="4.53">on which most likely he did and he was</text>
  <text start="214.139" dur="4.291">orchestrating a lot of this now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="216.51" dur="4.17">very interesting is that the central</text>
  <text start="218.43" dur="5.07">banks they keep telling us that well</text>
  <text start="220.68" dur="5.85">it&amp;#39;s really cryptocurrency that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="223.5" dur="4.169">problem criminals use it terrorists use</text>
  <text start="226.53" dur="3.72">it it&amp;#39;s used for money laundering</text>
  <text start="227.669" dur="4.71">extortion you name it but when we look</text>
  <text start="230.25" dur="4.439">at the banking system throughout the</text>
  <text start="232.379" dur="4.92">many years what is the banking system</text>
  <text start="234.689" dur="4.47">done they&amp;#39;ve done the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="237.299" dur="3.81">actually what if the central banking</text>
  <text start="239.159" dur="4.83">system what have they&amp;#39;ve done they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="241.109" dur="5.97">created a gigantic Ponzi scheme they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="243.989" dur="5.43">lied to governments and to the people in</text>
  <text start="247.079" dur="5.16">those countries about what is really</text>
  <text start="249.419" dur="5.341">going on so when you really want to see</text>
  <text start="252.239" dur="5.4">what&amp;#39;s going on and you hear the central</text>
  <text start="254.76" dur="4.979">bankers screaming at gold and silver</text>
  <text start="257.639" dur="4.141">it&amp;#39;s a barbarous relic you don&amp;#39;t need it</text>
  <text start="259.739" dur="4.021">it&amp;#39;s not worth anything it&amp;#39;s not real</text>
  <text start="261.78" dur="4.41">money maybe back a thousand years it was</text>
  <text start="263.76" dur="5.43">today the paper currency that&amp;#39;s the real</text>
  <text start="266.19" dur="4.949">money you have to think yourself are</text>
  <text start="269.19" dur="4.409">they telling us the truth when they tell</text>
  <text start="271.139" dur="5.731">us crypto currencies they&amp;#39;re used by</text>
  <text start="273.599" dur="7.04">terrorists they&amp;#39;re used by criminals</text>
  <text start="276.87" dur="6.66">they&amp;#39;re used for laundering money or</text>
  <text start="280.639" dur="5.171">blackmailing different companies you</text>
  <text start="283.53" dur="4.46">have to think to yourself is this really</text>
  <text start="285.81" dur="4.32">true because when you start to really</text>
  <text start="287.99" dur="3.609">look at what&amp;#39;s been going on and you</text>
  <text start="290.13" dur="3.42">flip everything that they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="291.599" dur="5.85">actually mirror everything that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="293.55" dur="5.67">saying you realize that they lie about</text>
  <text start="297.449" dur="4.051">everything it&amp;#39;s actually what they are</text>
  <text start="299.22" dur="3.99">doing and they don&amp;#39;t want you to see</text>
  <text start="301.5" dur="4.11">what they are doing so they use</text>
  <text start="303.21" dur="5.91">projection and they project it out onto</text>
  <text start="305.61" dur="6.36">cryptocurrency and precious metals we</text>
  <text start="309.12" dur="6.21">see here in the US the housing market is</text>
  <text start="311.97" dur="5.49">continually imploding on itself permits</text>
  <text start="315.33" dur="5.309">have plunged and we see permanence a</text>
  <text start="317.46" dur="4.799">plunge about 5.7 percent month on month</text>
  <text start="320.639" dur="4.56">the plunge in permanent is the worst</text>
  <text start="322.259" dur="5.97">month since February of 2017 and this</text>
  <text start="325.199" dur="5.43">suggests a rough time ahead for housing</text>
  <text start="328.229" dur="6.09">as permits plummet to the lowest since</text>
  <text start="330.629" dur="6.211">May 2017 and home builder stocks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="334.319" dur="4.291">gonna fall even further and the Fed as</text>
  <text start="336.84" dur="4.47">we know they&amp;#39;re going to be meet meeting</text>
  <text start="338.61" dur="3.69">very very soon and when they raise the</text>
  <text start="341.31" dur="2.97">interest rates what do you think is</text>
  <text start="342.3" dur="3.63">gonna happen to housing well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="344.28" dur="3.81">going to implode on itself</text>
  <text start="345.93" dur="5.1">and we&amp;#39;re gonna see things start to</text>
  <text start="348.09" dur="5.16">really fall apart remember everything is</text>
  <text start="351.03" dur="6.18">really wrapped around the housing market</text>
  <text start="353.25" dur="6.87">the middle-class America this is where</text>
  <text start="357.21" dur="4.859">most of their wealth is stored they save</text>
  <text start="360.12" dur="4.71">up they get a house the house</text>
  <text start="362.069" dur="4.201">appreciates and this is where they have</text>
  <text start="364.83" dur="3.929">everything and it&amp;#39;s also attached to</text>
  <text start="366.27" dur="8.429">many different economic sectors I mean</text>
  <text start="368.759" dur="9.601">lumber steel tar asphalt electrical</text>
  <text start="374.699" dur="6.09">plumbing copper you name it I mean</text>
  <text start="378.36" dur="6.959">furnishings you name it it&amp;#39;s tied to</text>
  <text start="380.789" dur="7.171">this and once this implodes on itself it</text>
  <text start="385.319" dur="5.671">then sends shockwaves to all the other</text>
  <text start="387.96" dur="6.329">economic sectors and those implode and</text>
  <text start="390.99" dur="5.099">you can&amp;#39;t stop it and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="394.289" dur="4.171">going to see happen because what happens</text>
  <text start="396.089" dur="3.44">when the interest rates rise people who</text>
  <text start="398.46" dur="4.53">are making a certain amount of money</text>
  <text start="399.529" dur="6.19">they&amp;#39;re knocked out of the market they</text>
  <text start="402.99" dur="4.679">can&amp;#39;t afford those houses anymore even</text>
  <text start="405.719" dur="5.1">if they have the downpayment even if</text>
  <text start="407.669" dur="5.851">they&amp;#39;re paying 0% down they still don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="410.819" dur="4.671">have enough to afford that house because</text>
  <text start="413.52" dur="3.84">the interest rates have moved up and</text>
  <text start="415.49" dur="4.139">those people who are looking to</text>
  <text start="417.36" dur="5.01">refinance they&amp;#39;re not going to do it and</text>
  <text start="419.629" dur="5.47">this is going to be a major problem and</text>
  <text start="422.37" dur="5.699">then also if we count auto loans student</text>
  <text start="425.099" dur="4.38">loans it&amp;#39;s going to affect every single</text>
  <text start="428.069" dur="2.701">area and this is why I believe that</text>
  <text start="429.479" dur="3.271">Trump and Powell they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="430.77" dur="4.049">together and the Fed is going to be</text>
  <text start="432.75" dur="4.259">raising the rent rates this time most</text>
  <text start="434.819" dur="4.681">likely in December if not the beginning</text>
  <text start="437.009" dur="5.611">of next year remember everything is</text>
  <text start="439.5" dur="5.279">timed and planned for a specific reason</text>
  <text start="442.62" dur="3.99">Trump this whole entire time but the</text>
  <text start="444.779" dur="4.411">Patriots behind him they have been</text>
  <text start="446.61" dur="5.789">pumping up this economy using the same</text>
  <text start="449.19" dur="3.48">manipulation that Obama was using prior</text>
  <text start="452.399" dur="2.311">to</text>
  <text start="452.67" dur="5.03">him that the central bank was using</text>
  <text start="454.71" dur="6.69">prior to him he just continuing this</text>
  <text start="457.7" dur="5.11">using their weapon against them for a</text>
  <text start="461.4" dur="3.78">specific reason what is that specific</text>
  <text start="462.81" dur="5.46">reason well the specific reason is that</text>
  <text start="465.18" dur="4.67">the system can no longer function it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="468.27" dur="5.76">falling apart very very quickly</text>
  <text start="469.85" dur="7">countries are losing faith in the u.s.</text>
  <text start="474.03" dur="5.19">dollar now this is not the United States</text>
  <text start="476.85" dur="5.85">remember it&amp;#39;s separate and apart the US</text>
  <text start="479.22" dur="6.36">dollar is not the people&amp;#39;s US dollar the</text>
  <text start="482.7" dur="7.26">US dollar is a central bank dollar that</text>
  <text start="485.58" dur="7.26">they created and told us to use this is</text>
  <text start="489.96" dur="6.21">their system America was completely</text>
  <text start="492.84" dur="6.62">co-opted back in 1913 and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="496.17" dur="5.52">forced to use this debt note ever since</text>
  <text start="499.46" dur="5.44">brainwashing us into thinking debt is a</text>
  <text start="501.69" dur="5.1">good thing which it is not and we know</text>
  <text start="504.9" dur="4.17">that countries around the world like</text>
  <text start="506.79" dur="4.5">Russia China and many others they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="509.07" dur="3.69">been dumping Treasuries now they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="511.29" dur="3.15">gonna dump them all at once because it</text>
  <text start="512.76" dur="2.64">would hurt themselves they&amp;#39;d dump a</text>
  <text start="514.44" dur="3">little bit at a time</text>
  <text start="515.4" dur="4.47">actually Russia has accelerated its</text>
  <text start="517.44" dur="4.92">process and when we look at this we can</text>
  <text start="519.87" dur="4.74">see that foreign private sector</text>
  <text start="522.36" dur="4.53">investors and foreign official investors</text>
  <text start="524.61" dur="4.2">central bank&amp;#39;s governments they have</text>
  <text start="526.89" dur="4.86">whittled down their holdings of US</text>
  <text start="528.81" dur="6.54">Treasury securities by 21 billion at the</text>
  <text start="531.75" dur="6.18">end of July compared to a year ago to</text>
  <text start="535.35" dur="5.04">6.25 trillion according to the Treasury</text>
  <text start="537.93" dur="6.66">Department tick data which was released</text>
  <text start="540.39" dur="7.26">a day ago so with foreigners having shed</text>
  <text start="544.59" dur="5.04">21 billion over the 12-month period who</text>
  <text start="547.65" dur="6.24">bought this one point four six eight</text>
  <text start="549.63" dur="6.36">trillion in new US Treasury debt well we</text>
  <text start="553.89" dur="4.98">know it was in Russia we know it was in</text>
  <text start="555.99" dur="5.61">Japan we know it was in China</text>
  <text start="558.87" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;ve been dumping Japan dumped quite</text>
  <text start="561.6" dur="3.78">a bit purchased a little bit then dumped</text>
  <text start="563.4" dur="6.33">some more but if you look at the graph</text>
  <text start="565.38" dur="7.17">their trajectory is downward when we</text>
  <text start="569.73" dur="4.77">start to really break this down we can</text>
  <text start="572.55" dur="4.71">start to see where most of the</text>
  <text start="574.5" dur="5.37">Treasuries are so we have foreign</text>
  <text start="577.26" dur="5.76">holders we have US government entities</text>
  <text start="579.87" dur="5.73">Federal Reserve and US institutions and</text>
  <text start="583.02" dur="5.999">individuals now foreign holders</text>
  <text start="585.6" dur="7.89">they have about 6.2 trillion worth of</text>
  <text start="589.019" dur="8.851">Treasury&amp;#39;s out of the 20 1.3 trillion US</text>
  <text start="593.49" dur="7.56">government entities have 5.7 Federal</text>
  <text start="597.87" dur="4.469">Reserve has about 2.3 so if we look at</text>
  <text start="601.05" dur="5.159">that number right now that&amp;#39;s about 8</text>
  <text start="602.339" dur="7.291">trillion for the US us institutions and</text>
  <text start="606.209" dur="7.5">individuals has overtaken the foreign</text>
  <text start="609.63" dur="9.199">holders they have 7 trillion so when we</text>
  <text start="613.709" dur="11.36">look at this about 15 or 15 trillion is</text>
  <text start="618.829" dur="10.601">owned by the US and the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="625.069" dur="8.171">most of it US institutions government</text>
  <text start="629.43" dur="8.849">and individuals so what we see here is</text>
  <text start="633.24" dur="6.99">that foreign holders are losing faith in</text>
  <text start="638.279" dur="4.591">the Treasuries and they are dumping them</text>
  <text start="640.23" dur="5.64">and the only place that can be picked up</text>
  <text start="642.87" dur="5.85">are investment companies here in the US</text>
  <text start="645.87" dur="4.8">and institutions in the US what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="648.72" dur="5.429">to happen when the number continually</text>
  <text start="650.67" dur="6.99">dwindles so the u.s. issues the debt the</text>
  <text start="654.149" dur="6.961">u.s. is buying its own debt I mean how</text>
  <text start="657.66" dur="5.64">is this going to play out this is not</text>
  <text start="661.11" dur="5.219">going to play out very well this shows</text>
  <text start="663.3" dur="4.649">us that countries are losing faith in</text>
  <text start="666.329" dur="3.93">the system and this is why Russia is out</text>
  <text start="667.949" dur="4.651">there saying listen we need to start</text>
  <text start="670.259" dur="6.45">using our national currencies they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="672.6" dur="6.21">telling countries it is time and we can</text>
