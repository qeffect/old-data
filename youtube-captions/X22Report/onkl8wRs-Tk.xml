  <text start="78.18" dur="5.939">Fed they&amp;#39;re working together to bring</text>
  <text start="80.7" dur="4.68">this economic system down and the reason</text>
  <text start="84.119" dur="5.371">why they&amp;#39;re bringing it down is because</text>
  <text start="85.38" dur="7.519">they need to crash it so they can reset</text>
  <text start="89.49" dur="6.629">it they need the central banking system</text>
  <text start="92.899" dur="5.201">completely demolished and we can see</text>
  <text start="96.119" dur="3.871">that the central banks the central bank</text>
  <text start="98.1" dur="5.07">of all central banks they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="99.99" dur="5.76">worried they are giving warnings they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="103.17" dur="5.16">been telling us that what the Fed is</text>
  <text start="105.75" dur="4.32">doing Trump&amp;#39;s policies they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="108.33" dur="4.47">to work it&amp;#39;s going to crash the economy</text>
  <text start="110.07" dur="3.859">and in the past we&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="112.8" dur="3.75">anything like this before</text>
  <text start="113.929" dur="5.23">normally the central banks they stay</text>
  <text start="116.55" dur="5.249">very quiet they might give a little</text>
  <text start="119.159" dur="5.791">blurb here and there but they don&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="121.799" dur="6.061">out with major major warnings telling</text>
  <text start="124.95" dur="6.059">you that the economy is going to enter a</text>
  <text start="127.86" dur="6.81">depression that we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot</text>
  <text start="131.009" dur="7.501">of trouble ahead of us and if we really</text>
  <text start="134.67" dur="7.28">think about this why in the world with</text>
  <text start="138.51" dur="7.77">the central banks come out and tell us</text>
  <text start="141.95" dur="5.319">the economy is going to crash think</text>
  <text start="146.28" dur="5.34">about this for a second</text>
  <text start="147.269" dur="6.111">during Obama we&amp;#39;re in this recovery the</text>
  <text start="151.62" dur="5.869">economy wasn&amp;#39;t really doing that well</text>
  <text start="153.38" dur="7.06">GDP numbers were barely hitting 2% and</text>
  <text start="157.489" dur="5.011">they&amp;#39;re telling us what a great recovery</text>
  <text start="160.44" dur="4.13">this is everything is fantastic</text>
  <text start="162.5" dur="4.019">everything the Fed is doing is</text>
  <text start="164.57" dur="6.22">incredible</text>
  <text start="166.519" dur="9.911">now we have the economy where the GDP</text>
  <text start="170.79" dur="8.82">numbers are 4% unemployment at the</text>
  <text start="176.43" dur="5.399">lowest point since 1969 and they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="179.61" dur="4.529">there reporting that the economy is</text>
  <text start="181.829" dur="4.711">going to crash I mean does this make</text>
  <text start="184.139" dur="2.611">sense now yes I know these numbers are</text>
  <text start="186.54" dur="2.01">all</text>
  <text start="186.75" dur="4.23">manipulated but if you really look at</text>
  <text start="188.55" dur="5.7">what&amp;#39;s going on here during the recovery</text>
  <text start="190.98" dur="6.03">phase they didn&amp;#39;t say a word about we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="194.25" dur="6.24">heading into a crash that the system&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="197.01" dur="6.54">going to break down only when Trump came</text>
  <text start="200.49" dur="6.69">in did they start pushing this warning</text>
  <text start="203.55" dur="5.88">and they&amp;#39;re pushing the warning while</text>
  <text start="207.18" dur="4.98">the economy these statistical numbers</text>
  <text start="209.43" dur="6.09">are doing better than we&amp;#39;ve ever ever</text>
  <text start="212.16" dur="6.81">seen before something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="215.52" dur="6.63">here you think they already knew that</text>
  <text start="218.97" dur="5.55">the economy was never ever strong do you</text>
  <text start="222.15" dur="5.19">think they already knew that the economy</text>
  <text start="224.52" dur="5.4">was going to break down and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="227.34" dur="4.68">have an event right now they already</text>
  <text start="229.92" dur="5.6">knew all of this they knew what was</text>
  <text start="232.02" dur="6.719">going to happen and they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="235.52" dur="6.25">projecting what&amp;#39;s going to happen and</text>
  <text start="238.739" dur="6.361">they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out a way to</text>
  <text start="241.77" dur="6.719">blame this on someone else besides the</text>
  <text start="245.1" dur="6.27">central bank&amp;#39;s so this way they can</text>
  <text start="248.489" dur="4.5">continue with their system and what I</text>
  <text start="251.37" dur="4.77">mean by continuing with their system</text>
  <text start="252.989" dur="6.361">what they want to do is they want to</text>
  <text start="256.14" dur="5.43">reset the system and start their system</text>
  <text start="259.35" dur="4.11">all over again I&amp;#39;m not talking about the</text>
  <text start="261.57" dur="3.63">people system I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="263.46" dur="3.24">central bank system they want their</text>
  <text start="265.2" dur="3.779">system still in place but they need to</text>
  <text start="266.7" dur="4.68">restart it they&amp;#39;ve brought their system</text>
  <text start="268.979" dur="4.711">to the very end this is the furthest it</text>
  <text start="271.38" dur="4.68">can go this is why they need an event</text>
  <text start="273.69" dur="4.1">like war or something like this to cover</text>
  <text start="276.06" dur="4.23">it up they don&amp;#39;t have it right now and</text>
  <text start="277.79" dur="4.54">they know eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="280.29" dur="3.72">happen is the entire system&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="282.33" dur="4.53">break down remember the United States</text>
  <text start="284.01" dur="5.19">right now is paying over a half a</text>
  <text start="286.86" dur="3.57">trillion dollars worth of interest on</text>
  <text start="289.2" dur="3.9">the debt</text>
  <text start="290.43" dur="6.03">the worldwide debt is ridiculous it</text>
  <text start="293.1" dur="6.69">cannot be sustained and their system is</text>
  <text start="296.46" dur="5.22">only designed to last up to a certain</text>
  <text start="299.79" dur="5.97">point and then it crashes especially</text>
  <text start="301.68" dur="5.28">when you remove the petrodollar system</text>
  <text start="305.76" dur="4.409">and of course Trump already gave that</text>
  <text start="306.96" dur="7.35">warning to the Saudis letting them know</text>
  <text start="310.169" dur="6.591">that soon they&amp;#39;re gonna have to pay for</text>
  <text start="314.31" dur="5.07">the United States to protect them</text>
  <text start="316.76" dur="5.11">doesn&amp;#39;t matter if they want it or not</text>
  <text start="319.38" dur="4.35">when he&amp;#39;s really saying is that we&amp;#39;re no</text>
  <text start="321.87" dur="3.09">longer going to do this because we&amp;#39;re no</text>
  <text start="323.73" dur="3.81">longer going to have the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="324.96" dur="6.12">system now Ron Paul is out there and</text>
  <text start="327.54" dur="6.48">he&amp;#39;s saying that the stock market it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="331.08" dur="5.4">going to decline by 50% and there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="334.02" dur="3.96">way to stop it and he&amp;#39;s right because we</text>
  <text start="336.48" dur="4.23">know that the stock market is one</text>
  <text start="337.98" dur="4.74">gigantic manipulation the housing</text>
  <text start="340.71" dur="5.22">markets going to fall most likely by</text>
  <text start="342.72" dur="6.36">half it was pumped up into this gigantic</text>
  <text start="345.93" dur="3.99">bubble it&amp;#39;s an illusion all of this is</text>
  <text start="349.08" dur="4.08">an illusion</text>
  <text start="349.92" dur="5.49">and this debt cannot be sustained this</text>
  <text start="353.16" dur="5.49">is how the central bank system is</text>
  <text start="355.41" dur="4.74">designed it&amp;#39;s only designed to last to a</text>
  <text start="358.65" dur="3.87">certain period and then it collapses</text>
  <text start="360.15" dur="5.31">John Williams who was on Greg hunter</text>
  <text start="362.52" dur="4.59">said the Fed is killing off the economy</text>
  <text start="365.46" dur="6.51">yes this is part of the plan</text>
  <text start="367.11" dur="8.61">the plan is to bring the system to its</text>
  <text start="371.97" dur="7.85">knees and blame it on the central bank</text>
  <text start="375.72" dur="7.14">and this is exactly what is happening</text>
  <text start="379.82" dur="5.32">John went on to say the Fed is trying to</text>
  <text start="382.86" dur="4.29">raise rates the idea is if you get</text>
  <text start="385.14" dur="4.65">higher rates the banks will be able to</text>
  <text start="387.15" dur="4.26">make more profits on their lending it</text>
  <text start="389.79" dur="3.45">will also encourage bank lending</text>
  <text start="391.41" dur="3.9">unfortunately on the consumer end it</text>
  <text start="393.24" dur="5.07">raises the consumers cost of borrowing</text>
  <text start="395.31" dur="4.65">as interest rates go up it makes</text>
  <text start="398.31" dur="3.63">mortgages more expensive</text>
  <text start="399.96" dur="4.74">it makes borrowing more expensive</text>
  <text start="401.94" dur="6.51">mortgages go up people don&amp;#39;t buy as many</text>
  <text start="404.7" dur="6.18">houses what you are seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="408.45" dur="4.92">effectively a recession in the housing</text>
  <text start="410.88" dur="4.47">market in the construction area existing</text>
  <text start="413.37" dur="4.05">home sales have been down for six or</text>
  <text start="415.35" dur="5.94">seven months in a row and it&amp;#39;s down</text>
  <text start="417.42" dur="8.49">year-over-year and he&amp;#39;s saying that the</text>
  <text start="421.29" dur="8.25">entire system is going to implode yes</text>
  <text start="425.91" dur="7.08">this is exactly what they are doing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="429.54" dur="6.33">part of the plan and this is why we have</text>
  <text start="432.99" dur="6.24">the biz this is why we have the IMF all</text>
  <text start="435.87" dur="6.33">out there giving warnings like they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="439.23" dur="4.8">never done before and if you read some</text>
  <text start="442.2" dur="4.05">of these warnings you can see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="444.03" dur="5.97">very very nervous let&amp;#39;s take a look at</text>

  <text start="460.22" dur="5.23">while the economy is doing better than</text>
  <text start="463.65" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s ever done before yes I know this is</text>
  <text start="465.45" dur="6.33">a fake economy but on the surface where</text>
  <text start="468.72" dur="5.79">everyone is believing this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="471.78" dur="5.43">trying to convince us that a crash is</text>
  <text start="474.51" dur="4.41">coming and the reason they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="477.21" dur="5.1">is because they want to blame this on</text>
  <text start="478.92" dur="5.64">Trump somehow some way but it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="482.31" dur="4.73">difficult to do coming out of Reuters</text>

  <text start="617.58" dur="3.27">when we&amp;#39;re going to be going through</text>
  <text start="618.63" dur="4.17">this transition the whole point of what</text>
  <text start="620.85" dur="4.679">Trump is doing right now is to prepare</text>
  <text start="622.8" dur="5.97">the United States for this transition we</text>
  <text start="625.529" dur="5.911">need to have manufacturing back</text>
  <text start="628.77" dur="4.2">he needs to undo everything the central</text>

  <text start="632.97" dur="4.53">been doing over the many many years they</text>
  <text start="635.88" dur="3.42">stripped the United States of almost</text>
  <text start="637.5" dur="4.529">everything because they were preparing</text>

  <text start="646.44" dur="5.43">now Trump with the short period of time</text>
  <text start="649.44" dur="5.16">he has he needs to reverse all of this</text>
  <text start="651.87" dur="5.85">and do it very very quickly will it be</text>
  <text start="654.6" dur="5.52">quick enough we don&amp;#39;t know but you could</text>
  <text start="657.72" dur="5.73">see he&amp;#39;s working very very fast at</text>
  <text start="660.12" dur="6.9">trying to do this and this all has to be</text>
  <text start="663.45" dur="4.889">done so the u.s. can move forward</text>
  <text start="667.02" dur="3.39">because we&amp;#39;re going to be on a</text>
  <text start="668.339" dur="4.921">completely different system and if we</text>
  <text start="670.41" dur="5.7">don&amp;#39;t have manufacturing we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="673.26" dur="5.49">be stuck remember before countries how</text>
  <text start="676.11" dur="4.8">to hold US dollars all around the world</text>
  <text start="678.75" dur="3.57">in their reserves and they would take</text>
  <text start="680.91" dur="3.6">those dollars and they would trade them</text>
  <text start="682.32" dur="5.91">in for our manufactured goods</text>
  <text start="684.51" dur="5.55">well countries will not have to hold the</text>
