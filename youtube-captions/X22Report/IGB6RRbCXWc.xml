  <text start="53.42" dur="4.919">hi and welcome you listening to the X</text>
  <text start="56.48" dur="5.37">when to report my name is Dave and this</text>
  <text start="58.339" dur="6.841">is episode 1453 a.n today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.85" dur="6">December 20th 2017 and the tot of the</text>
  <text start="65.18" dur="6.15">episode is warning we might have been</text>
  <text start="67.85" dur="6.39">tricked here&amp;#39;s how let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="71.33" dur="4.62">economic collapse financial news now as</text>
  <text start="74.24" dur="4.23">we can see the central banks are getting</text>
  <text start="75.95" dur="5.88">very worried because the brexit date is</text>
  <text start="78.47" dur="5.67">approaching and we know from the past</text>
  <text start="81.83" dur="3.959">the central bankers they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="84.14" dur="3.99">anyone to leave their system they want</text>
  <text start="85.789" dur="5.431">everyone in their system so they can</text>
  <text start="88.13" dur="5.01">control them and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="91.22" dur="3.09">brexit is going forward even though the</text>
  <text start="93.14" dur="3.149">central bakers are going to try to do</text>
  <text start="94.31" dur="5.309">whatever they possibly can to stop it we</text>
  <text start="96.289" dur="6.091">see the EU is out there we see the IMF</text>
  <text start="99.619" dur="6.03">is out there now saying that the growth</text>
  <text start="102.38" dur="6">forecast for the British economy is not</text>
  <text start="105.649" dur="5.881">going to be as good as we actually</text>
  <text start="108.38" dur="5.64">thought it&amp;#39;s gonna be a lot lower then</text>
  <text start="111.53" dur="5.909">we originally forecast because if</text>
  <text start="114.02" dur="6.66">they&amp;#39;re going to leave the eurozone it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="117.439" dur="4.951">not going to work out for the UK now of</text>
  <text start="120.68" dur="3.899">course what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="122.39" dur="4.769">playing this up to make everyone believe</text>
  <text start="124.579" dur="5.79">that without the central banks without</text>
  <text start="127.159" dur="5.251">being included without going along with</text>
  <text start="130.369" dur="4.68">all their rules there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="132.41" dur="5.1">problems in the UK and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="135.049" dur="5.31">doing this on purpose they want this as</text>
  <text start="137.51" dur="4.38">a clear message to everyone and they</text>
  <text start="140.359" dur="3.481">said during the referendum if the</text>
  <text start="141.89" dur="4.2">referendum goes through everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="143.84" dur="4.38">going to crash and it actually didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="146.09" dur="4.32">and whatever the central banks tell you</text>
  <text start="148.22" dur="4.62">it is always the opposite whatever</text>
  <text start="150.41" dur="5.1">government tells you it is always the</text>
  <text start="152.84" dur="6.3">opposite we see right now the house has</text>
  <text start="155.51" dur="6.18">passed the Trump tax plan it was</text>
  <text start="159.14" dur="4.05">recalled for technicalities and it looks</text>
  <text start="161.69" dur="3.03">like the vote went through and was</text>
  <text start="163.19" dur="3.75">passed once again now it moves on to the</text>
  <text start="164.72" dur="3.57">Senate and once again as we stated</text>
  <text start="166.94" dur="3.09">yesterday in the report there are</text>
  <text start="168.29" dur="2.849">certain senators that are going to</text>
  <text start="170.03" dur="3.6">benefit from this</text>
  <text start="171.139" dur="4.861">there was like a rider that was included</text>
  <text start="173.63" dur="5.1">in this and again it was shoved in at</text>
  <text start="176" dur="5.13">the last minute and many senators are</text>
  <text start="178.73" dur="4.31">going to benefit from this and once</text>
  <text start="181.13" dur="4.02">again this means that the government</text>
  <text start="183.04" dur="3.25">individuals that are working in our</text>
  <text start="185.15" dur="2.27">government that&amp;#39;s supposed to be working</text>
  <text start="186.29" dur="3.83">for the people there</text>
  <text start="187.42" dur="5.7">actually working for themselves now we</text>
  <text start="190.12" dur="5.61">see existing home sales the data from</text>
  <text start="193.12" dur="4.29">that came out new home sales pending</text>
  <text start="195.73" dur="4.74">home sales and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="197.41" dur="5.4">everything is surging they expected a</text>
  <text start="200.47" dur="4.739">point nine percent jump but now all of a</text>
  <text start="202.81" dur="3.87">sudden there was a surge of about 5.6</text>
  <text start="205.209" dur="4.831">percent this is the strongest pace of</text>
  <text start="206.68" dur="5.52">sales since December of 2006 now we need</text>
  <text start="210.04" dur="4.14">to understand something inventories</text>
  <text start="212.2" dur="4.259">they&amp;#39;re saying are crashing but sales</text>
  <text start="214.18" dur="3.87">are increasing forget about the pending</text>
  <text start="216.459" dur="4.261">home sales most of those are cancelled</text>
  <text start="218.05" dur="4.26">along the way the other thing that we</text>
  <text start="220.72" dur="4.32">need to understand is that home prices</text>
  <text start="222.31" dur="5.3">in these 20 cities they&amp;#39;re surging also</text>
  <text start="225.04" dur="5.64">while incomes are going down and</text>
  <text start="227.61" dur="5.02">mortgage applications are dropping we</text>
  <text start="230.68" dur="4.139">see they&amp;#39;ve dropped by 4.9 percent this</text>
  <text start="232.63" dur="5.1">week something like 4 percent last week</text>
  <text start="234.819" dur="6.151">yes there were up 4% but as we can see</text>
  <text start="237.73" dur="7.069">mortgage applications they have not gone</text>
  <text start="240.97" dur="7.17">anywhere it&amp;#39;s almost like a flatline and</text>
  <text start="244.799" dur="5.351">normally when you see the housing market</text>
  <text start="248.14" dur="4.409">increase you see more and more people</text>
  <text start="250.15" dur="5.22">taking out mortgages we&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="252.549" dur="4.47">seeing this and we&amp;#39;ve noticed when we</text>
  <text start="255.37" dur="2.97">broke it all down that a lot of these</text>
  <text start="257.019" dur="3.511">sales are coming from hedge fund</text>
  <text start="258.34" dur="5.43">investment companies foreign investors</text>
  <text start="260.53" dur="4.38">from the free money from the Fed and now</text>
  <text start="263.77" dur="2.85">we know the foreign investors are</text>
  <text start="264.91" dur="4.2">backing away and what&amp;#39;s even more</text>
  <text start="266.62" dur="5.93">interesting is that during the summer</text>
  <text start="269.11" dur="6.809">months the retail the real estate</text>
  <text start="272.55" dur="6.94">industry was hurting sales were down</text>
  <text start="275.919" dur="6.511">this time of the year is not really that</text>
  <text start="279.49" dur="5.91">great for real estate and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="282.43" dur="4.56">it surge something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="285.4" dur="3.18">and remember a lot of these numbers are</text>
  <text start="286.99" dur="5.04">coming from the government and they have</text>
  <text start="288.58" dur="4.89">the ability to manipulate and to make us</text>
  <text start="292.03" dur="3.12">believe that these things are really</text>
  <text start="293.47" dur="3.39">happening and all they have to do is</text>
  <text start="295.15" dur="3.66">pump in free money tell hedge funds</text>
  <text start="296.86" dur="4.11">investment companies you know go ahead</text>
  <text start="298.81" dur="3.81">purchase it as much as you can keep the</text>
  <text start="300.97" dur="4.199">houses off the market and this is</text>
  <text start="302.62" dur="5.7">exactly what they do now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="305.169" dur="6.631">interesting is that the stock market is</text>
  <text start="308.32" dur="5.25">continually moving up attending record</text>
  <text start="311.8" dur="4.109">levels we&amp;#39;ve never seen it before like</text>
  <text start="313.57" dur="5.599">this before you know in the past where</text>
  <text start="315.909" dur="5.021">it&amp;#39;s been so high now if you go back to</text>
  <text start="319.169" dur="3.5">2007-2008 we</text>
  <text start="320.93" dur="3.6">hitting 14,000 points and people said</text>
  <text start="322.669" dur="3.81">the same exact thing if you go back to</text>
  <text start="324.53" dur="3.56">the dot-com era people said the same</text>
  <text start="326.479" dur="4.5">thing if you go all the way back to 1929</text>
  <text start="328.09" dur="4.57">when it hit like 300 or 400 points</text>
  <text start="330.979" dur="4.41">people that said the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="332.66" dur="5.19">and then the market came down but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="335.389" dur="6.75">very interesting about the stock market</text>
  <text start="337.85" dur="6.39">it is shrinking at the same time the</text>
  <text start="342.139" dur="4.981">market is continually moving up now what</text>
  <text start="344.24" dur="6.63">I mean by that is that if we go back in</text>
  <text start="347.12" dur="6.51">time to 1975 the US domestic companies</text>
  <text start="350.87" dur="4.139">had traded on the US exchanges totaled</text>
  <text start="353.63" dur="5.009">around four thousand eight hundred</text>
  <text start="355.009" dur="5.371">nineteen forty years later the market is</text>
  <text start="358.639" dur="4.831">shrunk to less than four thousand</text>
  <text start="360.38" dur="6.03">despite tripling in GDP now if you take</text>
  <text start="363.47" dur="6.06">a shorter time span like 20 years which</text>
  <text start="366.41" dur="7.05">included the dot-com craze guess what</text>
  <text start="369.53" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s even worse the numbers of publicly</text>
  <text start="373.46" dur="4.29">listed companies trading on the US</text>
  <text start="374.72" dur="6.6">exchanges has been cut almost in half in</text>
  <text start="377.75" dur="6.72">the past 20 years from about 7,300</text>
  <text start="381.32" dur="5.58">to 3,700 because firms can&amp;#39;t grow</text>
  <text start="384.47" dur="4.439">organically that is built more business</text>
  <text start="386.9" dur="4.11">from new and existing customers they</text>
  <text start="388.909" dur="3.271">give up and pay high prices to acquire</text>
  <text start="391.01" dur="3.21">their competitors</text>
  <text start="392.18" dur="4.5">thus drastically shrinking the number of</text>
  <text start="394.22" dur="5.28">US public companies this seriously</text>
  <text start="396.68" dur="6.15">contributes to the massive loss of US</text>
  <text start="399.5" dur="6.72">middle-class jobs as of early 2017</text>
  <text start="402.83" dur="4.95">according to ernest ernst &amp;amp; young just a</text>
  <text start="406.22" dur="3.689">hundred and forty of these publicly</text>
  <text start="407.78" dur="4.05">traded companies represented more than</text>
  <text start="409.909" dur="5.431">half of the total market value of all</text>
  <text start="411.83" dur="5.309">stocks traded in the US another stark</text>
  <text start="415.34" dur="5.22">example of the dangerous trend of wealth</text>
  <text start="417.139" dur="6.96">concentration in the US and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="420.56" dur="5.49">seeing is that the center will have less</text>
  <text start="424.099" dur="4.771">companies I should say the central</text>
  <text start="426.05" dur="6.929">bankers are coming in and they&amp;#39;re buying</text>
  <text start="428.87" dur="7.56">as much as they possibly can to pump the</text>
  <text start="432.979" dur="5.341">markets up and there are no earnings for</text>
  <text start="436.43" dur="3.81">these companies they&amp;#39;re not bringing in</text>
  <text start="438.32" dur="5.4">more revenue they&amp;#39;re not making more</text>
  <text start="440.24" dur="7.89">sales so when we look at this the whole</text>
  <text start="443.72" dur="8.73">thing the entire thing is based on one</text>
  <text start="448.13" dur="6.67">gigantic illusion just like the economy</text>
  <text start="452.45" dur="5.469">and every time we dig deeper and deeper</text>
  <text start="454.8" dur="5.339">we see that this whole thing is one</text>
  <text start="457.919" dur="4.53">gigantic illusion and this is what the</text>
  <text start="460.139" dur="5.791">central bankers do now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="462.449" dur="4.891">interesting in the Washington Post they</text>
  <text start="465.93" dur="2.579">had this opinion piece and of course</text>
  <text start="467.34" dur="4.38">whenever they come out with these</text>
  <text start="468.509" dur="5.101">opinion pieces it&amp;#39;s like a little feeler</text>
  <text start="471.72" dur="4.11">of what the people are going to think</text>
  <text start="473.61" dur="3.779">about this they get it out there and</text>
  <text start="475.83" dur="3.209">they you know they drop the breadcrumbs</text>
  <text start="477.389" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;ll let everyone know that something</text>
  <text start="479.039" dur="6.6">is about to happen in the Washington</text>
  <text start="482.069" dur="6.241">Post they&amp;#39;re saying that the Fed coin is</text>
  <text start="485.639" dur="5.731">going to be bigger than Bitcoin now we</text>
  <text start="488.31" dur="5.34">talked about this before now there are</text>
  <text start="491.37" dur="3.96">two different camps in cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="493.65" dur="5.28">market where people are saying that this</text>
  <text start="495.33" dur="5.7">is a decentralized system that it was</text>
  <text start="498.93" dur="5.4">developed to move away from the bankers</text>
  <text start="501.03" dur="4.53">and this is a people&amp;#39;s currency the</text>
  <text start="504.33" dur="2.76">other camp is saying that this is a</text>
  <text start="505.56" dur="3.09">trick it was created by the NSA the</text>
  <text start="507.09" dur="4.199">government and they&amp;#39;re trying to trick</text>
  <text start="508.65" dur="5.1">us now I can see both sides to this I</text>
  <text start="511.289" dur="3.511">can see the decentralized portion of it</text>
  <text start="513.75" dur="5.01">where you have Bitcoin and other</text>
  <text start="514.8" dur="6.539">cryptocurrencies and if it is possible</text>
  <text start="518.76" dur="4.62">to keep the government to keep the</text>
  <text start="521.339" dur="4.591">central bank away from the</text>
  <text start="523.38" dur="7.47">cryptocurrency market I can see how this</text>
  <text start="525.93" dur="9.09">can work but as we know the central</text>
  <text start="530.85" dur="7.35">bankers those who are in power they</text>
  <text start="535.02" dur="6.629">don&amp;#39;t want this to happen and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="538.2" dur="7.11">talking about a Fed coin right now what</text>
  <text start="541.649" dur="5.071">does that mean it means that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="545.31" dur="3.33">going to create one now the Washington</text>
  <text start="546.72" dur="4.32">Post is saying that you know it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="548.64" dur="4.439">even created yet so when I look at this</text>
  <text start="551.04" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;ve already created the Fed coin</text>
  <text start="553.079" dur="6.691">it&amp;#39;s all ready to go what they need is</text>
  <text start="556.5" dur="9.18">they need the governments around the</text>
  <text start="559.77" dur="9.66">world to pass laws to say that you can</text>
  <text start="565.68" dur="6.18">only use the Fed coin now I have an</text>
  <text start="569.43" dur="5.159">interview coming up with Jeff Nielsen</text>
  <text start="571.86" dur="6.589">and we discussed this and one of their</text>
  <text start="574.589" dur="7.68">ways that they can do this is they can</text>
  <text start="578.449" dur="5.291">create a bubble in Bitcoin now I know</text>
  <text start="582.269" dur="2.701">we&amp;#39;ve been saying that bitcoins not a</text>
  <text start="583.74" dur="5.05">bubble but listen to what I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="584.97" dur="7.6">here if the central bank</text>
  <text start="588.79" dur="6.63">buys more and more of the cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="592.57" dur="4.35">Bitcoin it&amp;#39;s very easy for them to do</text>
  <text start="595.42" dur="2.55">this all they have to do is create money</text>
  <text start="596.92" dur="2.28">out of thin air and they have two BOTS</text>
  <text start="597.97" dur="3.3">they can buy it up just like they do</text>
  <text start="599.2" dur="3.15">with the stock market just like they do</text>
  <text start="601.27" dur="3.33">with the real estate and everything else</text>
  <text start="602.35" dur="7.17">so they create currency out of thin air</text>
  <text start="604.6" dur="7.05">they buy cryptocurrency they build it up</text>
  <text start="609.52" dur="5.46">where the price goes up and up and up</text>
  <text start="611.65" dur="5.16">and up they get people into Bitcoin now</text>
  <text start="614.98" dur="5.37">is the whole country into Bitcoin now</text>
  <text start="616.81" dur="7.65">it&amp;#39;s a very small portion then all of a</text>
  <text start="620.35" dur="7.23">sudden they sell now if they have about</text>
  <text start="624.46" dur="6.24">70 or 60 or 80 percent of the market</text>
  <text start="627.58" dur="5.79">it&amp;#39;s going to decimate the market</text>
  <text start="630.7" dur="6.42">they&amp;#39;ll bring it down they then can make</text>
  <text start="633.37" dur="6.42">the case of why bitcoin and all other</text>
  <text start="637.12" dur="5.73">krypton cryptocurrencies they&amp;#39;re too</text>
  <text start="639.79" dur="6.27">volatile they&amp;#39;re dangerous and we need a</text>
  <text start="642.85" dur="7.71">Fed coin and it just so happens they</text>
  <text start="646.06" dur="7.08">have one ready to go all we need is for</text>
  <text start="650.56" dur="6.51">governments to pass laws to say let the</text>
  <text start="653.14" dur="7.05">central bank&amp;#39;s handle the crypto</text>
  <text start="657.07" dur="7.8">currency market where everyone has to</text>
  <text start="660.19" dur="7.92">use the Fed coin I mean they could do</text>
  <text start="664.87" dur="7.2">this very easily they&amp;#39;ve done it before</text>
  <text start="668.11" dur="7.47">they pump up the stock market they dump</text>
  <text start="672.07" dur="5.67">it they collect the wealth they do it to</text>
  <text start="675.58" dur="4.86">the housing market they do it to</text>
  <text start="677.74" dur="6.42">everything they create they are the</text>
  <text start="680.44" dur="5.97">masters of creating bubbles where they</text>
  <text start="684.16" dur="4.62">build stuff up and then they pull the</text>
  <text start="686.41" dur="4.65">rug out from under it and we can see</text>
  <text start="688.78" dur="4.23">right now this is something that they</text>
  <text start="691.06" dur="5.04">might do now the Federal Reserve is</text>
  <text start="693.01" dur="5.73">talking about this the biz is talking</text>
  <text start="696.1" dur="3.54">about this and the IMF is talking this</text>
  <text start="698.74" dur="3.3">and I thought it was very suspicious</text>
  <text start="699.64" dur="4.83">when the IMF came out and they started</text>
  <text start="702.04" dur="4.86">to talk about Bitcoin and they said it</text>
  <text start="704.47" dur="5.4">was good because this does not fit into</text>
  <text start="706.9" dur="6.12">their model having a decentralized</text>
  <text start="709.87" dur="5.1">currency type of system where they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="713.02" dur="3.48">have control and they can&amp;#39;t attach any</text>
  <text start="714.97" dur="4.89">type of interest where the governments</text>
  <text start="716.5" dur="4.5">have to borrow this currency now I could</text>
  <text start="719.86" dur="2.349">see where they were saying that the</text>
  <text start="721" dur="3.79">cryptocurrency market</text>
  <text start="722.209" dur="6.901">is great as long as you go along with us</text>
  <text start="724.79" dur="9.479">and we can see that this could be their</text>
  <text start="729.11" dur="7.139">trick this could be a ploy to make</text>
  <text start="734.269" dur="4.86">everyone feel good and this is what they</text>
  <text start="736.249" dur="4.59">do you feel great in the stock market</text>
  <text start="739.129" dur="4.14">you feel great in the housing market and</text>
  <text start="740.839" dur="4.68">then all of a sudden everything crashes</text>
  <text start="743.269" dur="6.961">you feel great in the crypto market</text>
  <text start="745.519" dur="9.091">Bitcoin litecoin - and then all of a</text>
  <text start="750.23" dur="7.109">sudden boom they start selling they drop</text>
  <text start="754.61" dur="5.519">the market and they can make their case</text>
  <text start="757.339" dur="4.62">very easily and you want to hear more if</text>
  <text start="760.129" dur="3.69">you want to hear more about this listen</text>
  <text start="761.959" dur="3.72">to the interview with Jeff Nielsen and I</text>
  <text start="763.819" dur="4.8">I&amp;#39;m going to be putting this up later</text>
  <text start="765.679" dur="4.38">tonight which is Wednesday December 20th</text>
  <text start="768.619" dur="3.63">and you can listen to the entire</text>
  <text start="770.059" dur="5.431">interview and we could see right now</text>
  <text start="772.249" dur="5.671">that this is a possibility and we need</text>
  <text start="775.49" dur="3.81">to be very cautious in what we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="777.92" dur="2.789">and this is why when people say well I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="779.3" dur="3.389">going all in on cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="780.709" dur="3.66">I&amp;#39;m not doing anything else this is why</text>
  <text start="782.689" dur="4.38">I say you have to be very careful yes I</text>
  <text start="784.369" dur="4.71">do own crypto currencies yes I have</text>
  <text start="787.069" dur="4.921">Bitcoin yes I have</text>
  <text start="789.079" dur="6.45">litecoin - and all others but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="791.99" dur="6.959">have everything in there I still buy</text>
  <text start="795.529" dur="6.691">gold and silver I buy a little bit of</text>
  <text start="798.949" dur="6.36">each to make sure that I&amp;#39;m covered no</text>
  <text start="802.22" dur="6.869">matter what happens and we can see that</text>
  <text start="805.309" dur="6.96">this is a real possibility on how they</text>
  <text start="809.089" dur="6.901">can convince the world into staying with</text>
  <text start="812.269" dur="5.19">the central banking system so all I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="815.99" dur="3.449">gonna say is be very careful out there</text>
  <text start="817.459" dur="4.261">because central bankers they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="819.439" dur="4.291">honest they&amp;#39;re only in it for themselves</text>
  <text start="821.72" dur="3.719">they don&amp;#39;t care if you lose all your</text>
  <text start="823.73" dur="4.649">wealth because their job is to take your</text>
  <text start="825.439" dur="6.24">wealth their job is to steal your</text>
  <text start="828.379" dur="6.541">property your assets it&amp;#39;s to steal and</text>
  <text start="831.679" dur="5.551">Rob countries of their assets and to put</text>
  <text start="834.92" dur="5.579">everyone to the internet to enslave them</text>
  <text start="837.23" dur="8.329">this is their manifesto this is what</text>
  <text start="840.499" dur="8.34">they do so we can see that this is a</text>
  <text start="845.559" dur="5.47">possibility in what is happening today</text>
  <text start="848.839" dur="4.62">and I&amp;#39;m saying be very careful in what</text>
  <text start="851.029" dur="4.771">you&amp;#39;re doing now again we see that the</text>
  <text start="853.459" dur="4.921">entire system is</text>
  <text start="855.8" dur="5.909">breaking down and they know that the</text>
  <text start="858.38" dur="7.05">dollar is gonna eventually go away they</text>
  <text start="861.709" dur="5.791">know that it cannot continue on they</text>
  <text start="865.43" dur="5.19">can&amp;#39;t sustain it there&amp;#39;s just too much</text>
  <text start="867.5" dur="4.67">debt the petrodollar system is losing</text>
  <text start="870.62" dur="4.02">its grip in the Middle East and</text>
  <text start="872.17" dur="4.359">everything is falling apart rapidly and</text>
  <text start="874.64" dur="3.379">there are people that say you know they</text>
  <text start="876.529" dur="3.24">STR will be on the high level</text>
  <text start="878.019" dur="3.461">cryptocurrency will be on the lower</text>
  <text start="879.769" dur="3.361">level where people will use this to</text>
  <text start="881.48" dur="4.859">trade and we could see how this could be</text>
  <text start="883.13" dur="5.1">a real possibility so I still say</text>
  <text start="886.339" dur="4.081">purchase gold and silver to protect your</text>
  <text start="888.23" dur="4.59">wealth that is a really great way to</text>
  <text start="890.42" dur="4.89">protect against inflation to protect</text>
  <text start="892.82" dur="5.04">against transitions and I also say yes</text>
  <text start="895.31" dur="4.5">be in the crypto market make sure you</text>
  <text start="897.86" dur="3.87">have you know a little bit in that</text>
  <text start="899.81" dur="4.17">market just in case this is the</text>
  <text start="901.73" dur="3.87">direction we go in and again they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="903.98" dur="3.87">make it very easy for you to take your</text>
  <text start="905.6" dur="4.2">Bitcoin or you like coin or whatever and</text>
  <text start="907.85" dur="4.14">trade it in for the Fed coin but again</text>
  <text start="909.8" dur="4.44">the people at some point need to stand</text>
  <text start="911.99" dur="4.65">up and say we don&amp;#39;t want the Fed coin</text>
  <text start="914.24" dur="3.96">but what they&amp;#39;ll do is they&amp;#39;ll they just</text>
  <text start="916.64" dur="4.35">won&amp;#39;t put it out there they&amp;#39;re gonna try</text>
  <text start="918.2" dur="5.94">to pass laws just like when the Fed came</text>
  <text start="920.99" dur="4.89">into existence they had to pass a law to</text>
  <text start="924.14" dur="3.87">make sure that everyone used a Federal</text>
  <text start="925.88" dur="5.37">Reserve Note they&amp;#39;re going to have to do</text>
  <text start="928.01" dur="5.43">the same thing once again so again the</text>
  <text start="931.25" dur="4.38">economy is still coming down the system</text>
  <text start="933.44" dur="3.93">is about the transition you need to be</text>
