  <text start="237.76" dur="6.3">priorities of the British people he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="240.88" dur="7.829">letting everyone know that once this</text>
  <text start="244.06" dur="8.94">happens once the brexit is done what</text>
  <text start="248.709" dur="8.87">happens everyone starts to realize that</text>
  <text start="253" dur="8.19">the EU has been keeping the UK down and</text>
  <text start="257.579" dur="6.4">as more and more investments come in as</text>
  <text start="261.19" dur="9.93">more and more trade deals are created</text>
  <text start="263.979" dur="9.271">and as the economy prospers this is what</text>

  <text start="273.25" dur="4.38">the central banks around the world this</text>
  <text start="274.419" dur="6.06">is what they fear the most now as soon</text>
  <text start="277.63" dur="4.92">as the brexit happens or right before</text>
  <text start="280.479" dur="3.841">the brexit we know the central bank</text>
  <text start="282.55" dur="3.929">they&amp;#39;re going to push fear they&amp;#39;re going</text>

  <text start="544.91" dur="6.93">this private organization is what is</text>
  <text start="548" dur="5.61">controlling the economy now that&amp;#39;s phase</text>
  <text start="551.84" dur="5.06">one phase two</text>

  <text start="556.9" dur="5.82">on the board of the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="558.97" dur="7.44">those people that are into sound money</text>

  <text start="628.89" dur="7.68">fears it fears the people waking up</text>
  <text start="633.43" dur="6.06">because once there is an economic</text>
  <text start="636.57" dur="5.86">awakening once the people understand and</text>
  <text start="639.49" dur="5.55">realize what this is all about and that</text>
  <text start="642.43" dur="5.34">their lives don&amp;#39;t have to be this way</text>
  <text start="645.04" dur="5.61">and don&amp;#39;t get me wrong there are certain</text>
