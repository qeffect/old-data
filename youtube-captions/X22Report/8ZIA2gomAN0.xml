  <text start="91.09" dur="9.059">now the deep State they struggled with</text>
  <text start="96.99" dur="5.71">Horowitz testimony they tried to make</text>
  <text start="100.149" dur="4.32">sense of it they tried to push their</text>
  <text start="102.7" dur="6.029">agenda that kept on bringing up Ukraine</text>
  <text start="104.469" dur="7.591">Russian collusion and they didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="108.729" dur="8.521">to ask the real questions they were</text>
  <text start="112.06" dur="8.01">afraid of the answers they pushed that</text>
  <text start="117.25" dur="5.189">the investigation was open legally that</text>
  <text start="120.07" dur="4.25">there was no bias they kind of stuck</text>
  <text start="122.439" dur="5.18">with that and then they threw in</text>
  <text start="124.32" dur="7.87">impeachment Russia and many other things</text>
  <text start="127.619" dur="8.951">but the important facts were after it</text>
  <text start="132.19" dur="6.63">was open not why it was open because</text>
  <text start="136.57" dur="5.43">with the facts that the FBI received</text>
  <text start="138.82" dur="8.249">they should have shut it down but they</text>
  <text start="142" dur="5.67">didn&amp;#39;t they manipulated they falsified</text>

  <text start="147.67" dur="6.24">[Music]</text>
  <text start="149.17" dur="8.01">that&amp;#39;s the damaging part they lied to</text>
  <text start="153.91" dur="7.35">the FISA Court they doctored documents</text>
  <text start="157.18" dur="6.779">hid exculpatory evidence secretly taped</text>
  <text start="161.26" dur="6.3">conversations with informants went</text>
  <text start="163.959" dur="6.871">through emails and phone calls the</text>
  <text start="167.56" dur="8.25">Pfizer report and hearing it was very</text>
  <text start="170.83" dur="7.32">very important to have it was needed</text>
  <text start="175.81" dur="3.929">because most of the people had no idea</text>
  <text start="178.15" dur="6.99">that this was going on</text>
  <text start="179.739" dur="8.661">yes all of us we knew but the everyday</text>
  <text start="185.14" dur="6.48">person they&amp;#39;re pretty much in the dark</text>
  <text start="188.4" dur="6.52">this is the introduction to what was</text>
  <text start="191.62" dur="5.76">going on and at each stage it will wake</text>
  <text start="194.92" dur="5.13">more and more people up they&amp;#39;ll start to</text>
  <text start="197.38" dur="5.46">think logically the last questions and</text>
  <text start="200.05" dur="4.89">as we enter the D class and the Criminal</text>
  <text start="202.84" dur="5.28">Investigations and crimes against</text>
  <text start="204.94" dur="4.88">humanity the people will see how all of</text>
  <text start="208.12" dur="7.29">this fits together</text>
  <text start="209.82" dur="10.63">remember this was about the FISA abuse</text>
  <text start="215.41" dur="8.99">it was limited to the FBI to FISA that</text>
  <text start="220.45" dur="7.52">was the scope everything outside of this</text>
  <text start="224.4" dur="8.53">horowitz had no clue this was laid out</text>
  <text start="227.97" dur="9.16">to show who was involved their names</text>
  <text start="232.93" dur="6.45">what they did how they did it that it</text>
  <text start="237.13" dur="5.87">wasn&amp;#39;t just a simple mistake</text>
  <text start="239.38" dur="7.079">they changed emails on purpose they</text>
  <text start="243" dur="7.93">purposely omitted information to get the</text>
  <text start="246.459" dur="6.09">warrants they did this on purpose we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="250.93" dur="3.8">be talking about the hearing and what</text>
  <text start="252.549" dur="5.25">comes next in a little bit but first</text>
  <text start="254.73" dur="6.309">remember how Bloomberg News organization</text>
  <text start="257.799" dur="5.821">was not going to investigate Bloomberg</text>
  <text start="261.039" dur="6.121">and they said they&amp;#39;re only gonna</text>
  <text start="263.62" dur="6.75">investigate Trump well the FEC is now</text>
  <text start="267.16" dur="5.06">looking into Bloomberg News now this was</text>
  <text start="270.37" dur="4.169">filed by media Research Center the</text>
  <text start="272.22" dur="4.3">complaint asserts that omitting coverage</text>
  <text start="274.539" dur="4.681">of Democratic presidential candidates</text>
  <text start="276.52" dur="5.519">may constitute an improper contribution</text>
  <text start="279.22" dur="3.759">to Bloomberg&amp;#39;s campaign under the FEC</text>
  <text start="282.039" dur="2.951">regulate</text>
  <text start="282.979" dur="4.231">the complain asserts that the decision</text>
  <text start="284.99" dur="4.32">to investigate Trump and not the</text>
  <text start="287.21" dur="4.29">opposing Democratic candidate can be</text>
  <text start="289.31" dur="3.93">considered a contribution or a thing of</text>
  <text start="291.5" dur="3.96">value under the federal election</text>
  <text start="293.24" dur="5.04">campaign Act and should therefore be</text>
  <text start="295.46" dur="6.69">investigated by the FC FEC for potential</text>
  <text start="298.28" dur="7.8">FECA violations we&amp;#39;ll have to see how</text>
  <text start="302.15" dur="6.329">that all turns out now the deep state</text>
  <text start="306.08" dur="4.74">the mainstream media they&amp;#39;re struggling</text>
  <text start="308.479" dur="5.101">with their narrative the Russian</text>
  <text start="310.82" dur="4.23">collusion failed the impeachment does</text>
  <text start="313.58" dur="4.02">not have the support of the American</text>
  <text start="315.05" dur="5.149">people they have no case there is no</text>
  <text start="317.6" dur="5.789">crime and they fell into the trap that</text>
  <text start="320.199" dur="7.961">the Patriots laid out for them where</text>
  <text start="323.389" dur="10.56">they&amp;#39;re going to expose the entire deep</text>
  <text start="328.16" dur="8.039">state Democratic apparatus and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="333.949" dur="5.611">in the process of exposing this right</text>
  <text start="336.199" dur="5.431">now more of it is going to happen in the</text>
  <text start="339.56" dur="4.139">Senate trials and they&amp;#39;re going to turn</text>
  <text start="341.63" dur="3.78">this around now if they don&amp;#39;t vote for</text>
  <text start="343.699" dur="3.961">impeachment let&amp;#39;s say it happens the</text>
  <text start="345.41" dur="4.11">opposite way where the house says you</text>
  <text start="347.66" dur="5.85">know something we don&amp;#39;t want to do this</text>
  <text start="349.52" dur="8.389">and they vote it down the Patriots have</text>
  <text start="353.51" dur="7.589">another plan but when I notice lately is</text>
  <text start="357.909" dur="5.801">that they&amp;#39;re continuing with the Russian</text>
  <text start="361.099" dur="5.31">story that the Russians are going to</text>
  <text start="363.71" dur="4.829">interfere in the elections Trump is</text>
  <text start="366.409" dur="4.591">doing nothing to stop the Russians and</text>
  <text start="368.539" dur="4.681">it seems like they&amp;#39;re trying to build a</text>
  <text start="371" dur="4.59">narrative right now since they know the</text>
  <text start="373.22" dur="4.34">impeachment process is not going to work</text>
  <text start="375.59" dur="3.99">the Russian collusion didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="377.56" dur="4.329">everything else they tried didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="379.58" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re trying to build the narrative</text>
  <text start="381.889" dur="8.071">that the elections are going to be</text>
  <text start="385.01" dur="6.74">rigged and if Trump wins well the</text>
  <text start="389.96" dur="6">elections are illegitimate</text>
  <text start="391.75" dur="6.88">now Nadler implied unless Trump is</text>
  <text start="395.96" dur="5.429">impeached and removed from office we</text>
  <text start="398.63" dur="5.909">should all expect the 2020 election will</text>
  <text start="401.389" dur="7.02">be illegitimate too so they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="404.539" dur="6.031">trying to push this narrative forward to</text>
  <text start="408.409" dur="3.69">say if he wins or when he wins because</text>
  <text start="410.57" dur="2.05">they know he&amp;#39;s going to they don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="412.099" dur="2.351">have a can</text>
  <text start="412.62" dur="4.32">they can go up against him I still think</text>
  <text start="414.45" dur="4.49">Michelle Obama and even Clinton might</text>
  <text start="416.94" dur="5.84">throw her hat into the ring but I think</text>
  <text start="418.94" dur="6.97">Obama that&amp;#39;s Barack Obama is waiting for</text>
  <text start="422.78" dur="4.21">Michelle Obama to be announced and I do</text>
  <text start="425.91" dur="3.78">believe they&amp;#39;re trying to use the</text>
  <text start="426.99" dur="5.19">impeachment to bring Trump down a peg or</text>
  <text start="429.69" dur="5.1">two but they&amp;#39;re already setting up the</text>
  <text start="432.18" dur="6.09">narrative that the elections will be</text>
  <text start="434.79" dur="6.92">illegitimate because if all else fails</text>
  <text start="438.27" dur="7.85">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re gonna fall back on</text>
  <text start="441.71" dur="7.45">now today Horowitz was giving testimony</text>
  <text start="446.12" dur="5.65">what was the purpose of this why was</text>
  <text start="449.16" dur="4.89">this needed to move forward this was</text>
  <text start="451.77" dur="4.65">needed to educate the people to show</text>
  <text start="454.05" dur="6.6">that low-level senior management they</text>
  <text start="456.42" dur="5.09">were biased who was involved how was it</text>
  <text start="460.65" dur="3.45">done</text>
  <text start="461.51" dur="5.59">that the deeps they play pers purposely</text>
  <text start="464.1" dur="4.65">kept going with the investigation hiding</text>
  <text start="467.1" dur="4.98">information from the FISA courts</text>
  <text start="468.75" dur="4.86">changing emails continued to continue</text>
  <text start="472.08" dur="3.17">with the illegal surveillance also known</text>
  <text start="473.61" dur="4.74">as spying</text>
  <text start="475.25" dur="8.17">now the mainstream media was also</text>
  <text start="478.35" dur="8.85">involved in covering up or pushing the</text>
  <text start="483.42" dur="6.63">narrative of the Steele dossier remember</text>
  <text start="487.2" dur="5.1">the mainstream media is working with the</text>
  <text start="490.05" dur="5.48">intelligence organization so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="492.3" dur="8.13">always on the same page and techno Fogg</text>
  <text start="495.53" dur="7.33">actually shows us from the past how all</text>
  <text start="500.43" dur="4.98">these individuals were pretty much</text>
  <text start="502.86" dur="5.07">saying the same thing without doing any</text>
  <text start="505.41" dur="6.54">type of investigative work they just</text>

  <text start="777.029" dur="4.231">of narrative that there was no bias and</text>
  <text start="778.92" dur="4.71">that there was a there was a predicate</text>

  <text start="783.63" dur="6.62">legal the predicate was legal and it was</text>
  <text start="786.75" dur="7.68">okay to start and Horowitz said yes in</text>
  <text start="790.25" dur="6.04">his mind the predicate was legal and</text>
  <text start="794.43" dur="5.37">they had a right to start this now</text>
  <text start="796.29" dur="5.43">Durham is countering what Horowitz is</text>

  <text start="806.54" dur="5.8">everything else remember he&amp;#39;s the why</text>
  <text start="810.77" dur="4.81">Horowitz</text>
  <text start="812.34" dur="5.25">is showing the individual player showing</text>

  <text start="836.01" dur="6.329">I do not know their state of mind at</text>

  <text start="847.38" dur="5.43">can&amp;#39;t explain why they did this he</text>

  <text start="857.52" dur="5.21">because they have a lot more information</text>
  <text start="860.15" dur="6.01">now later in the hearing</text>
  <text start="862.73" dur="6.19">IG Horowitz testified he cannot rule out</text>

  <text start="880.1" dur="7.35">now Rex he put out this information and</text>
  <text start="884.79" dur="5.88">said the following about the predication</text>
  <text start="887.45" dur="5.86">yes the IG found that there was a</text>
  <text start="890.67" dur="5.43">factual predicate to justify the opening</text>

  <text start="896.1" dur="6.03">doesn&amp;#39;t mean the factual predicate is</text>
  <text start="899.01" dur="5.61">true remember it was the CIA that</text>
  <text start="902.13" dur="6">created the factual predicate not the</text>
  <text start="904.62" dur="6.12">FBI this is why Durham has the</text>

  <text start="912.51" dur="4.82">look at the NSA didn&amp;#39;t look at anything</text>
  <text start="914.25" dur="5.49">else except the FBI let me continue</text>
  <text start="917.33" dur="5.11">horodyszcze saying that the facts they</text>
  <text start="919.74" dur="5.31">used were sufficient if those facts were</text>

  <text start="930.17" dur="5.82">Durham will now show that the factual</text>

  <text start="979.959" dur="5.88">everything else you hear is all fake</text>
  <text start="982.329" dur="6.36">take a listen to what he said a total</text>

  <text start="991.059" dur="4.411">handled in a thoughtful responsible way</text>
  <text start="992.8" dur="4.86">by DOJ and the FBI I think the notion</text>
  <text start="995.47" dur="5.099">that FISA was abused here is nonsense</text>
  <text start="997.66" dur="6.51">and today we learned that he lied about</text>
  <text start="1000.569" dur="6.24">that during the questioning Graham also</text>
  <text start="1004.17" dur="6.169">quoted Comey saying that the FISA report</text>
  <text start="1006.809" dur="5.94">vindicated him this is what Graham said</text>
  <text start="1010.339" dur="4.6">Comey said this week your report</text>
  <text start="1012.749" dur="4.95">vindicated him is that a fair assessment</text>
  <text start="1014.939" dur="6.38">Horowitz then answered I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="1017.699" dur="7.26">this report vindicates anybody involved</text>
  <text start="1021.319" dur="4.921">it doesn&amp;#39;t doesn&amp;#39;t exonerate him doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1024.959" dur="4.171">vindicate him</text>
  <text start="1026.24" dur="5.38">Horowitz also says that he would have</text>
  <text start="1029.13" dur="3.959">never submitted the FISA renewal</text>
  <text start="1031.62" dur="3.99">application with the information that</text>
  <text start="1033.089" dur="6.84">the FBI used he said no doubt about it</text>
  <text start="1035.61" dur="6.63">it had no business going in then</text>
  <text start="1039.929" dur="5.28">Horowitz confirmed that the steel</text>

  <text start="1045.209" dur="5.731">entire investigation not for the start</text>
  <text start="1048.48" dur="4.049">of the investigation because that from</text>
  <text start="1050.94" dur="4.44">that came from someplace else</text>
  <text start="1052.529" dur="4.89">just like Rex said it was a made-up lie</text>

  <text start="1057.419" dur="6.571">the FBI didn&amp;#39;t know if it was true or</text>
  <text start="1060.419" dur="7.081">not so they started to investigate then</text>
  <text start="1063.99" dur="7.909">they used the steel dossier to get the</text>

  <text start="1071.899" dur="4.27">FBI and Department officials told us the</text>

  <text start="1107.35" dur="8.76">know that the FBI to spy on truck they</text>
  <text start="1112.27" dur="4.94">used a defensive briefing they came in</text>
  <text start="1116.11" dur="3.87">and said listen we&amp;#39;re gonna give you a</text>
  <text start="1117.21" dur="6.94">defensive briefing and they spied on</text>
  <text start="1119.98" dur="8.07">Trump while this was going on Graham was</text>
  <text start="1124.15" dur="10.71">concerned about this because he said</text>

  <text start="1139" dur="5.76">write up 302s on the meeting so he asked</text>
  <text start="1142.21" dur="5.1">Horowitz is the FBI going to be spying</text>
  <text start="1144.76" dur="4.95">on us and writing up our conversation</text>
  <text start="1147.31" dur="4.83">Horowitz said I&amp;#39;m concerned about that</text>
  <text start="1149.71" dur="6.39">he&amp;#39;s concerned about what happened with</text>
  <text start="1152.14" dur="7.35">Trump so when they say they didn&amp;#39;t spy</text>
  <text start="1156.1" dur="6.98">on him they actually did because they</text>
  <text start="1159.49" dur="6.45">pretended they were giving him a</text>
  <text start="1163.08" dur="4.96">defensive debriefing but they were</text>
  <text start="1165.94" dur="6.15">recording what he said and they were</text>
  <text start="1168.04" dur="6.63">using that now throughout the testimony</text>
  <text start="1172.09" dur="5.85">of Horowitz he wouldn&amp;#39;t say the word</text>
  <text start="1174.67" dur="7.26">spying he used the word illegal</text>
  <text start="1177.94" dur="7.11">surveillance which pretty much is the</text>
  <text start="1181.93" dur="4.8">same thing as spying because if it was</text>

  <text start="1212.06" dur="5.85">cover up the spying before the FISA this</text>
  <text start="1215.75" dur="4.47">is why it&amp;#39;s so sloppy because they</text>
