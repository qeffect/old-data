  <text start="89.539" dur="7.541">here in the US and Europe Asia and we</text>
  <text start="94.619" dur="5.191">see that the u.s. decided to release</text>
  <text start="97.08" dur="5.73">some information and it was the final</text>
  <text start="99.81" dur="6.629">revision of the fourth quarter 2015 GDP</text>
  <text start="102.81" dur="5.76">and they released it and the final</text>
  <text start="106.439" dur="5.671">result was one point four percent and</text>
  <text start="108.57" dur="5.7">the print was still well below the two</text>
  <text start="112.11" dur="5.369">percent that they thought we were going</text>
  <text start="114.27" dur="6.66">to hit and we can see right now that the</text>
  <text start="117.479" dur="5.551">figure marks a slow down from the 2.2%</text>
  <text start="120.93" dur="4.89">average pace in the first three quarters</text>
  <text start="123.03" dur="5.31">of 2015 now remember a lot of this man</text>
  <text start="125.82" dur="5.85">is manipulated a lot of this has been</text>
  <text start="128.34" dur="7.23">recalculated and we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="131.67" dur="6.39">stuffed in with Obamacare and I see the</text>
  <text start="135.57" dur="5.34">corporate media is out there trying to</text>
  <text start="138.06" dur="5.01">convince everyone that consumer spending</text>
  <text start="140.91" dur="5.46">is up you see we have the strength of</text>
  <text start="143.07" dur="6.24">the economy it is keeping the economy</text>
  <text start="146.37" dur="5.16">going but when we look closely at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="149.31" dur="4.05">really going on here it&amp;#39;s not that that</text>
  <text start="151.53" dur="2.97">people are going out to retail stores</text>
  <text start="153.36" dur="3.9">and buying goods with their</text>
  <text start="154.5" dur="6.169">discretionary funds the consumer</text>
  <text start="157.26" dur="5.48">spending it is up because of Obamacare</text>
  <text start="160.669" dur="6.811">when we look at</text>
  <text start="162.74" dur="8.64">the spending we see that people have</text>
  <text start="167.48" dur="7.77">spent on health care in 2015 one point</text>
  <text start="171.38" dur="7.76">nine trillion in real dollars and this</text>
  <text start="175.25" dur="7.71">is the biggest single source of</text>
  <text start="179.14" dur="7.69">incremental spinning by nearly a factor</text>
  <text start="182.96" dur="5.31">of two it is only a matter of two to</text>
  <text start="186.83" dur="4.89">three quarters before health care</text>
  <text start="188.27" dur="6.45">surpasses housing as the biggest use of</text>
  <text start="191.72" dur="5.73">American cash putting all this into</text>
  <text start="194.72" dur="4.5">context a recent report from the freedom</text>
  <text start="197.45" dur="4.11">partners health found that health</text>
  <text start="199.22" dur="4.85">insurance premiums have increased faster</text>
  <text start="201.56" dur="5.13">than wages and inflation in recent years</text>
  <text start="204.07" dur="6.37">rising an average about twenty-eight</text>
  <text start="206.69" dur="6.72">percent from 2009 to 2014 despite</text>
  <text start="210.44" dur="5.19">Obamacare well because of Obamacare we</text>
  <text start="213.41" dur="6.33">see everything is going up and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="215.63" dur="7.4">getting less and less of a benefit this</text>
  <text start="219.74" dur="7.32">is what drove americ consumer spending</text>
  <text start="223.03" dur="7.81">this is what&amp;#39;s keeping the economy</text>
  <text start="227.06" dur="7.28">looking like we&amp;#39;re in some type of major</text>
  <text start="230.84" dur="6.96">recovery and we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="234.34" dur="7.39">people do not have discretionary funds</text>
  <text start="237.8" dur="6.57">to go out and purchase goods so we see</text>
  <text start="241.73" dur="4.11">this hoopla all around the corporate</text>
  <text start="244.37" dur="3.45">media the government trying to make</text>
  <text start="245.84" dur="3.72">everyone feel like yes you see consumer</text>
  <text start="247.82" dur="6.99">spending this is what the middle class</text>
  <text start="249.56" dur="8.37">is back no people are being forced to</text>
  <text start="254.81" dur="5.87">spend this money on health care because</text>
  <text start="257.93" dur="6.66">if you don&amp;#39;t then you&amp;#39;re penalized and</text>
  <text start="260.68" dur="7.09">they have you because there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="264.59" dur="5.4">competition they can continually raise</text>
  <text start="267.77" dur="5.07">the premiums and you&amp;#39;ll just end up</text>
  <text start="269.99" dur="6.18">paying more and more and more and it</text>
  <text start="272.84" dur="5.79">will keep GDP looking like it&amp;#39;s chugging</text>
  <text start="276.17" dur="4.35">along here but with all of this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="278.63" dur="3.9">only at one point four percent with all</text>
  <text start="280.52" dur="4.35">the manipulation can you imagine if you</text>
  <text start="282.53" dur="5.07">stripped all this out we would be in</text>
  <text start="284.87" dur="4.98">negative territory right now we see the</text>
  <text start="287.6" dur="5.879">Baltic Dry Index inching up and when we</text>
  <text start="289.85" dur="5.77">look at this we see that the Baltics sea</text>
  <text start="293.479" dur="4.631">freight rates</text>
  <text start="295.62" dur="4.92">they have increased and they are</text>
  <text start="298.11" dur="4.29">charging higher rates for bigger vessels</text>
  <text start="300.54" dur="4.11">right now and this is why we see the</text>
  <text start="302.4" dur="3.66">Baltic Dry Index ticking up at this time</text>
  <text start="304.65" dur="3.06">it&amp;#39;s not because things are getting</text>
  <text start="306.06" dur="3.62">better it&amp;#39;s because there&amp;#39;s a little bit</text>
  <text start="307.71" dur="5.9">of a manipulation going on right now and</text>
  <text start="309.68" dur="7.6">they&amp;#39;re able to do this by charging more</text>
  <text start="313.61" dur="7.559">now we know the United States they want</text>
  <text start="317.28" dur="9.99">sanctions on Venezuela and we see that</text>
  <text start="321.169" dur="8.651">China has said absolutely not the g77 in</text>
  <text start="327.27" dur="5.49">China affirmed their solidarity with</text>
  <text start="329.82" dur="5.49">Venezuela saying there is going to be</text>
  <text start="332.76" dur="4.68">absolutely no sanctions against</text>
  <text start="335.31" dur="4.919">Venezuela whatsoever now of course we</text>
  <text start="337.44" dur="5.58">know Obama back on March third sign an</text>
  <text start="340.229" dur="5.581">executive order saying that we need to</text>
  <text start="343.02" dur="4.91">renew the sanctions of Venezuela saying</text>
  <text start="345.81" dur="4.41">that you know it&amp;#39;s a national emergency</text>
  <text start="347.93" dur="3.519">with respect to unusual and</text>
  <text start="350.22" dur="2.699">extraordinary threat to the national</text>
  <text start="351.449" dur="3.421">security and foreign policy of the</text>
  <text start="352.919" dur="3.12">United States yet because what they want</text>
  <text start="354.87" dur="3.63">is a puppet government in there that</text>
  <text start="356.039" dur="5.041">they can control and they can capture</text>
  <text start="358.5" dur="4.289">their natural resources and put the</text>
  <text start="361.08" dur="4.32">country into a huge amount of debt which</text>
  <text start="362.789" dur="4.831">kind of they already are but they will</text>
  <text start="365.4" dur="4.71">allow them to take their natural</text>
  <text start="367.62" dur="5.25">resources and they will use the dollar</text>
  <text start="370.11" dur="4.67">for all of it and they&amp;#39;ll control it and</text>
  <text start="372.87" dur="5.58">this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="374.78" dur="8.199">because really Venezuela is a threat to</text>
  <text start="378.45" dur="6.39">the u.s. how and if you notice they use</text>
  <text start="382.979" dur="4.5">all these different terms to make you</text>
  <text start="384.84" dur="5.57">think like it must be a threat now out</text>
  <text start="387.479" dur="6.321">in Ukraine we see Russia is demanding</text>
  <text start="390.41" dur="7.66">683 thousand dollars in daily interest</text>
  <text start="393.8" dur="6.76">on their three billion overdue debt we</text>
  <text start="398.07" dur="7.08">know that Kiev has defaulted on this</text>
  <text start="400.56" dur="7.47">debt and they&amp;#39;re looking to collect some</text>
  <text start="405.15" dur="6.299">interest on this and we&amp;#39;ll have to see</text>
  <text start="408.03" dur="5.91">what Kiev does at this point which most</text>
  <text start="411.449" dur="4.981">likely they&amp;#39;re not going to pay it but</text>
  <text start="413.94" dur="5.849">we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see we see out in</text>
  <text start="416.43" dur="6">Libya the SAS forces they have been</text>
  <text start="419.789" dur="4.351">deployed to libya since the beginning of</text>
  <text start="422.43" dur="4.169">this year according to confidential</text>
  <text start="424.14" dur="5.3">briefings giving to the US congressional</text>
  <text start="426.599" dur="5.931">leaders by the king of Jordan</text>
  <text start="429.44" dur="6">it was a leaked memo that indicates that</text>
  <text start="432.53" dur="5.4">the US lawmakers were briefed on all of</text>
  <text start="435.44" dur="4.59">this saying that Jordan has special</text>
  <text start="437.93" dur="5.64">forces that are operating alongside</text>
  <text start="440.03" dur="4.8">British forces inside of Libya now it</text>
  <text start="443.57" dur="3.15">looks like United States government</text>
  <text start="444.83" dur="4.38">central bankers and the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="446.72" dur="5.04">are going to be making their move inside</text>
  <text start="449.21" dur="4.35">of Libya right now the US and the</text>
  <text start="451.76" dur="3.96">coalition forces and the new unity</text>
  <text start="453.56" dur="4.64">government is saying that trip Lee is</text>
  <text start="455.72" dur="5.01">under the control of unrecognized</text>
  <text start="458.2" dur="4.42">administration and the UN back</text>
  <text start="460.73" dur="5.13">government says we&amp;#39;ll be heading to the</text>
  <text start="462.62" dur="5.07">capital to begin work authorities in</text>
  <text start="465.86" dur="4.91">control of Libya&amp;#39;s capital and Friday</text>
  <text start="467.69" dur="6.3">they declared a state of an emergency</text>
  <text start="470.77" dur="5.59">saying we&amp;#39;ll wait a minute we told you</text>
  <text start="473.99" dur="4.53">you cannot come into Tripoli as a</text>
  <text start="476.36" dur="5.88">government as individuals yes but as a</text>
  <text start="478.52" dur="6.12">government absolutely not and we will</text>
  <text start="482.24" dur="8.52">reject any government that tries to push</text>
  <text start="484.64" dur="12.48">into our country so we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="490.76" dur="9">now that the u.s. France Italy Egypt UK</text>
  <text start="497.12" dur="5.7">and the rest of the coalition forces are</text>
  <text start="499.76" dur="6.39">saying okay we&amp;#39;ve had enough it is time</text>
  <text start="502.82" dur="6.93">to make a change and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="506.15" dur="7.71">push their way into Libya and this is</text>
  <text start="509.75" dur="6.39">going to cause a major problem we see</text>
  <text start="513.86" dur="5.64">turkish war planes they are striking the</text>
  <text start="516.14" dur="6.51">PKK and North Iraq right now of course</text>
  <text start="519.5" dur="4.56">Iraqis are saying you&amp;#39;re not supposed to</text>
  <text start="522.65" dur="3.84">be doing this you&amp;#39;re in a sovereign</text>
  <text start="524.06" dur="4.11">country and we actually ordered your the</text>
  <text start="526.49" dur="3.27">troops out of our country and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="528.17" dur="4.08">just not listening actually if you</text>
  <text start="529.76" dur="6.39">really listen no one is listening to any</text>
  <text start="532.25" dur="6.12">of these countries in this area if we</text>
  <text start="536.15" dur="3.51">look at Syria the United States and the</text>
  <text start="538.37" dur="2.85">coalition forces are not listening to</text>
  <text start="539.66" dur="3.78">the government there they just invaded a</text>
  <text start="541.22" dur="4.02">sovereign country Iraq has been telling</text>
  <text start="543.44" dur="4.56">the US and Turkey listen get out of our</text>
  <text start="545.24" dur="5.22">country libia the government there is</text>
  <text start="548" dur="3.81">saying hey you just can&amp;#39;t make up a</text>
  <text start="550.46" dur="2.82">government and say this is the new</text>
  <text start="551.81" dur="3.42">government because the people elected</text>
  <text start="553.28" dur="3.69">this government and we are in Tripoli</text>
  <text start="555.23" dur="7.05">abiding by the constitution of our</text>
  <text start="556.97" dur="6.54">country and we see in Yemen the puppet</text>
  <text start="562.28" dur="2.73">government was kicked out and</text>
  <text start="563.51" dur="4.05">people are saying we don&amp;#39;t want that</text>
  <text start="565.01" dur="6.72">government but the US doesn&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="567.56" dur="8.25">this they need control of the Middle</text>
  <text start="571.73" dur="6.21">East now the Pentagon is saying that</text>
  <text start="575.81" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re moving to increase US troops in</text>
  <text start="577.94" dur="5.61">Iraq very soon so we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="580.91" dur="5.1">this number go up from five to seven</text>
  <text start="583.55" dur="3.96">thousand most likely to 10,000 now</text>
  <text start="586.01" dur="3.95">what&amp;#39;s very strange about all this is</text>
  <text start="587.51" dur="5.88">that the Islamic state is on the run and</text>
  <text start="589.96" dur="5.38">they&amp;#39;re being destroyed in Syria the</text>
  <text start="593.39" dur="4.38">Iraqi forces are destroying them in Iraq</text>
  <text start="595.34" dur="6.96">but it seems that there&amp;#39;s more and more</text>
  <text start="597.77" dur="8.73">troops heading to all of these areas now</text>
  <text start="602.3" dur="7.74">you would think after Russia stepped in</text>
  <text start="606.5" dur="6.27">and started destroying everything why</text>
  <text start="610.04" dur="5.72">would we need more forces in this area</text>
  <text start="612.77" dur="5.64">if the Islamic state is on the run and</text>
  <text start="615.76" dur="4.69">they&amp;#39;re losing the battles in all these</text>
  <text start="618.41" dur="4.38">different areas towns and cities are</text>
  <text start="620.45" dur="5.1">being liberated it makes no sense why</text>
  <text start="622.79" dur="5.04">more forces at this time would need to</text>
  <text start="625.55" dur="5.4">come into the picture because when we go</text>
  <text start="627.83" dur="6">back 18 months when the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="630.95" dur="6.18">was expanding across Syria where were</text>
  <text start="633.83" dur="6.96">all the troops why didn&amp;#39;t they bring</text>
  <text start="637.13" dur="6.12">more in at that point why because their</text>
  <text start="640.79" dur="5.94">proxy army was doing exactly what they</text>
  <text start="643.25" dur="6.57">wanted expanding in Syria taking over</text>
  <text start="646.73" dur="6.03">more and more territory and going to go</text>
  <text start="649.82" dur="7.31">after Assad after they were ready to do</text>
  <text start="652.76" dur="8.01">this and they&amp;#39;re causing chaos in Libya</text>
  <text start="657.13" dur="5.65">Lebanon Yemen Iraq and now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="660.77" dur="3.72">happening is they&amp;#39;re losing their proxy</text>
  <text start="662.78" dur="4.61">army so they have to replace these</text>
  <text start="664.49" dur="7.32">forces with who the coalition forces and</text>
  <text start="667.39" dur="8.65">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now we</text>
  <text start="671.81" dur="7.89">see that Mark Toner when he was asked a</text>
  <text start="676.04" dur="7.5">question about should the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="679.7" dur="7.02">be taken out of Palmyra should they be</text>
  <text start="683.54" dur="6.24">pushed out and he kind of fumbled and</text>
  <text start="686.72" dur="5.19">mumbled around saying that no I mean</text>
  <text start="689.78" dur="4.32">look I mean broadly speaking it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="691.91" dur="4.71">great choice either or but which is</text>
  <text start="694.1" dur="3.33">worse I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s worse is the</text>
  <text start="696.62" dur="3.84">Islamic state</text>
  <text start="697.43" dur="6.99">or Assad or maybe the Assad the Islamic</text>
  <text start="700.46" dur="7.65">state is worse and you would think well</text>
  <text start="704.42" dur="5.37">if it&amp;#39;s a terrorist group you wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="708.11" dur="3.93">want the terrorist group inside the</text>

  <text start="712.04" dur="4.14">off guard you can see well he knows in</text>
  <text start="714.68" dur="2.19">the back of his mind that it&amp;#39;s the proxy</text>
  <text start="716.18" dur="3.12">army the United States government</text>
  <text start="716.87" dur="4.5">central bankers and he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="719.3" dur="5.43">figure out a way out of this question</text>
  <text start="721.37" dur="5.37">and it just didn&amp;#39;t work because we see</text>
  <text start="724.73" dur="6.24">there&amp;#39;s cease-fire peace talks going on</text>
  <text start="726.74" dur="6">right now we see Russia is pushing the</text>
  <text start="730.97" dur="4.98">Islamic state out of the country along</text>
  <text start="732.74" dur="7.02">with the Syrian forces and the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="735.95" dur="7.71">completely backed into a corner what do</text>
  <text start="739.76" dur="5.61">they do at this point and this is what</text>
  <text start="743.66" dur="3.06">they&amp;#39;ve been preparing for now when is</text>
  <text start="745.37" dur="3.06">it when are they going to actually hit</text>
  <text start="746.72" dur="3.869">what are they actually going to make</text>
  <text start="748.43" dur="4.409">this major offensive we don&amp;#39;t know at</text>
  <text start="750.589" dur="4.56">this point but we can see forces are</text>
  <text start="752.839" dur="5.131">definitely being built up we see since</text>
  <text start="755.149" dur="5.761">the Islamic state is being destroyed in</text>
  <text start="757.97" dur="5.19">Syria and in Iraq not because the United</text>
  <text start="760.91" dur="5.16">States because of Russia and the Iraqi</text>
  <text start="763.16" dur="6.929">forces they had this false flag in</text>
  <text start="766.07" dur="6.84">Brussels to show that the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="770.089" dur="6.69">is still strong to show and to bring the</text>
  <text start="772.91" dur="5.91">European nations into the area to bring</text>
  <text start="776.779" dur="7.131">in more military assets and more troops</text>
  <text start="778.82" dur="9.269">to go into Syria and we see right now</text>
  <text start="783.91" dur="7.869">for the third time in two years the</text>
  <text start="788.089" dur="5.671">United States has killed the Islamic</text>
  <text start="791.779" dur="4.621">state second in command now we see this</text>
  <text start="793.76" dur="4.47">quite often where the US will come out</text>
  <text start="796.4" dur="3.689">and saying oh we killed the commander we</text>
  <text start="798.23" dur="3.69">killed the second-in-command with Camil</text>
  <text start="800.089" dur="3.361">we killed the finance minister we kill</text>
  <text start="801.92" dur="4.98">and they continually do this and then</text>
  <text start="803.45" dur="7.41">all of a sudden this person reappears</text>
  <text start="806.9" dur="8.1">someplace else I mean this person has</text>
  <text start="810.86" dur="6.18">died before Al kadu Lee he died last</text>
  <text start="815" dur="6.6">April for instance and a strike on a</text>
  <text start="817.04" dur="5.88">mosque in Iraq and he was killed in the</text>
  <text start="821.6" dur="3.929">strike according to The Wall Street</text>
  <text start="822.92" dur="6.75">Journal he was also killed in September</text>
  <text start="825.529" dur="5.771">of 2014 where air strikes killed him at</text>
  <text start="829.67" dur="3.31">that point and here we are</text>
  <text start="831.3" dur="3.45">once again killing the same exact person</text>
  <text start="832.98" dur="4.229">and what they do is they keep moving</text>
  <text start="834.75" dur="4.29">around and hopefully people forget what</text>
  <text start="837.209" dur="5.07">actually happened and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="839.04" dur="5.04">actually killing these people they say</text>
  <text start="842.279" dur="6.031">they&amp;#39;re dead but if they need them once</text>
  <text start="844.08" dur="6.569">again they bring them back what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="848.31" dur="4.44">doing is they&amp;#39;re cleaning up and tidying</text>
  <text start="850.649" dur="4.411">up certain areas because they know</text>
  <text start="852.75" dur="5.07">Russia the Syrian forces are coming in</text>
  <text start="855.06" dur="7.29">they know the Iraqi forces are pushing</text>
  <text start="857.82" dur="7.29">in on muscle and we see the u.s. is in</text>
  <text start="862.35" dur="5.07">cleanup phase right now trying to clean</text>
  <text start="865.11" dur="5.58">up documentation trying to clean up the</text>
  <text start="867.42" dur="6.9">entire operation but certain items are</text>
  <text start="870.69" dur="5.579">being left behind and they&amp;#39;re not doing</text>
  <text start="874.32" dur="5.73">such a great job and it&amp;#39;s all pointing</text>
  <text start="876.269" dur="7.291">back to Turkey and to the US now we know</text>
  <text start="880.05" dur="6.51">that John Kerry was visiting Lavrov and</text>
  <text start="883.56" dur="6.42">Russia and they made an agreement that</text>
  <text start="886.56" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;ll have some type or a push for a</text>
  <text start="889.98" dur="3.72">political transition in Syria by having</text>
  <text start="892.05" dur="3.75">a new draft of the constitution ready by</text>
  <text start="893.7" dur="5.55">August now what&amp;#39;s very strange about</text>
  <text start="895.8" dur="6.65">this is that Surya isn&amp;#39;t really involved</text>
  <text start="899.25" dur="5.31">in this this is Russia and the US</text>
  <text start="902.45" dur="4.27">speaking about what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="904.56" dur="4.43">in Syria now I don&amp;#39;t know if the Syrian</text>
  <text start="906.72" dur="4.83">government agrees with this at all but</text>
  <text start="908.99" dur="5.38">they&amp;#39;re going to push and talk to the</text>
  <text start="911.55" dur="5.909">Syrian government in August about a new</text>
  <text start="914.37" dur="5.37">constitution but Russia still says</text>
  <text start="917.459" dur="3.901">listen we&amp;#39;re not going to talk about if</text>
  <text start="919.74" dur="4.23">Assad is going to be removed at this</text>
  <text start="921.36" dur="4.5">point because it&amp;#39;s not up to governments</text>
  <text start="923.97" dur="3.63">to decide who&amp;#39;s going to be in power who</text>
  <text start="925.86" dur="4.89">is not going to be empowered it&amp;#39;s left</text>
  <text start="927.6" dur="6.049">up to the people and of course this is</text>
  <text start="930.75" dur="6.89">just the beginning of this peace process</text>
  <text start="933.649" dur="6.071">where they&amp;#39;re trying to push a change in</text>
  <text start="937.64" dur="4.96">Syria this is what the United States</text>
  <text start="939.72" dur="6.179">wants now is this going to happen we</text>
  <text start="942.6" dur="5.549">don&amp;#39;t know because we have many</text>
  <text start="945.899" dur="5.521">different factors we have the Syrian</text>
  <text start="948.149" dur="6.271">government we have the opposition we</text>
  <text start="951.42" dur="6.599">have Saudi Arabia we have the US Russia</text>
  <text start="954.42" dur="5.7">and we know that Russia and Syria are</text>
  <text start="958.019" dur="5.541">watching the US very very carefully and</text>
  <text start="960.12" dur="4.95">what&amp;#39;s going on here so right now</text>
  <text start="963.56" dur="3.7">they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="965.07" dur="4.65">about it and they&amp;#39;re talking about peace</text>
  <text start="967.26" dur="6.12">and remember the goal is always the same</text>
  <text start="969.72" dur="7.11">if the u.s. does not get its way it will</text>
  <text start="973.38" dur="6.57">resort to violence and war to remove</text>
  <text start="976.83" dur="4.59">Assad period and I don&amp;#39;t think Assad is</text>
  <text start="979.95" dur="4.95">going to be going down that easily</text>
  <text start="981.42" dur="6.6">because he&amp;#39;s been in this since going</text>
  <text start="984.9" dur="5.75">back to 2011 here he&amp;#39;s been fighting all</text>
  <text start="988.02" dur="6.39">this time he asked Russia to come in and</text>
  <text start="990.65" dur="6.13">remove the terror threat and a sassages</text>
  <text start="994.41" dur="4.44">going to say okay whatever the US wants</text>
  <text start="996.78" dur="3.3">that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m going to do no he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="998.85" dur="4.14">going to leave it up to the people and</text>
  <text start="1000.08" dur="6.24">if Assad is voted back into power guess</text>
  <text start="1002.99" dur="7.41">what the US is not going to sit back and</text>
  <text start="1006.32" dur="5.91">say eh that&amp;#39;s okay with me no they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1010.4" dur="3.27">going to go after Assad actually they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1012.23" dur="6.27">going to most likely do it before the</text>
  <text start="1013.67" dur="8.19">elections before any of this now out in</text>
  <text start="1018.5" dur="6.23">Belgium we see things are shifting where</text>
  <text start="1021.86" dur="6.66">everything is becoming a police state</text>
  <text start="1024.73" dur="6.13">just one day after this false flag we</text>
  <text start="1028.52" dur="4.5">see that governments media national</text>
  <text start="1030.86" dur="5.849">security experts are saying that we need</text>
  <text start="1033.02" dur="6.33">less freedoms and more security well</text>
  <text start="1036.709" dur="7.38">that didn&amp;#39;t take long they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1039.35" dur="7.349">listen to keep everyone safe we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1044.089" dur="5.131">to need more security where need we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1046.699" dur="4.771">going to need to spy on the people we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1049.22" dur="3.54">going to need additional laws we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1051.47" dur="4.56">going to need more boots on the ground</text>
  <text start="1052.76" dur="7.14">and we see British author and journalist</text>
  <text start="1056.03" dur="6.75">Max Hastings says our tolerance of</text>
  <text start="1059.9" dur="4.89">electronic surveillance subject to legal</text>
  <text start="1062.78" dur="4.59">and parliamentary oversight seems a</text>
  <text start="1064.79" dur="4.68">small price to pay for some measure of</text>
  <text start="1067.37" dur="4.86">security against threats that nobody</text>
  <text start="1069.47" dur="6.03">today of all days can doubt are real in</text>
  <text start="1072.23" dur="5.34">the United States we see that people are</text>
  <text start="1075.5" dur="6.09">taking this and using it for their own</text>
  <text start="1077.57" dur="6.81">agenda where they&amp;#39;re saying okay we need</text>
  <text start="1081.59" dur="4.83">a national commission to explore how the</text>
  <text start="1084.38" dur="5.97">government and law enforcement could</text>
  <text start="1086.42" dur="7.17">access encrypted communications now back</text>
  <text start="1090.35" dur="6.45">in Paris they didn&amp;#39;t use encryption they</text>
  <text start="1093.59" dur="4.9">use burner phones because these are</text>
  <text start="1096.8" dur="4.33">false flag events</text>
  <text start="1098.49" dur="5.1">and even if it was a real event let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="1101.13" dur="5.1">with their way of thinking they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1103.59" dur="6.99">going to be using an iphone or an</text>
  <text start="1106.23" dur="7.44">android phone or Facebook or Twitter to</text>
  <text start="1110.58" dur="4.08">to to coordinate their plans they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1113.67" dur="3.48">going to have their own encryption</text>
  <text start="1114.66" dur="4.05">method if they&amp;#39;re going to use some type</text>
  <text start="1117.15" dur="3.96">of electronic device they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1118.71" dur="5.67">have a burner phone or they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1121.11" dur="8.04">use any other method this again is about</text>
  <text start="1124.38" dur="6.9">spying on every single person now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1129.15" dur="4.65">getting more information that the</text>
  <text start="1131.28" dur="5.52">Islamic state their next attacks could</text>
  <text start="1133.8" dur="6.09">be Russia and then ultimately the United</text>
  <text start="1136.8" dur="6">States so we can see at this point in</text>
  <text start="1139.89" dur="5.87">time the Islamic state is completely</text>
  <text start="1142.8" dur="5.37">falling apart the proxy army is</text>
  <text start="1145.76" dur="5.53">non-existent at this time they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1148.17" dur="4.74">to keep the fear factor alive by using</text>
  <text start="1151.29" dur="3.72">these false flags and we know this is</text>
  <text start="1152.91" dur="5.94">going to continue on as time goes on</text>
  <text start="1155.01" dur="7.02">because nothing has changed the economy</text>
  <text start="1158.85" dur="5.67">is falling apart and collapsing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1162.03" dur="4.68">running out of time they need to control</text>
  <text start="1164.52" dur="5.039">the entire area we can see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1166.71" dur="4.469">taking their proxy army and moving them</text>
  <text start="1169.559" dur="3.631">to different areas within the Middle</text>
  <text start="1171.179" dur="5.701">East to get prepared and ready to go</text>
  <text start="1173.19" dur="5.73">into these countries and nothing has</text>
  <text start="1176.88" dur="4.23">changed at this point the biggest change</text>
  <text start="1178.92" dur="5.07">is that Russia and Syria are working</text>
  <text start="1181.11" dur="4.92">together and the United States and the</text>
  <text start="1183.99" dur="7.02">coalition forces have lost their edge in</text>
