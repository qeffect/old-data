  <text start="65.17" dur="6.63">the crackdown begins central banks move</text>
  <text start="68.17" dur="5.4">to control the economic system let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="71.8" dur="4.26">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="73.57" dur="5.28">news now we understand that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="76.06" dur="5.4">fight on who&amp;#39;s going to control the</text>
  <text start="78.85" dur="4.95">economic system in the end and we</text>
  <text start="81.46" dur="4.32">realize that the central bankers they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="83.8" dur="5.49">been duplicating everything out in the</text>
  <text start="85.78" dur="7.83">East China we understand that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="89.29" dur="5.73">pushing for their own currency out there</text>
  <text start="93.61" dur="3.54">which is going to be separate and apart</text>
  <text start="95.02" dur="3.63">from the dollar and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="97.15" dur="3.54">make the world switch to this because</text>
  <text start="98.65" dur="4.92">they realize that their old system it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="100.69" dur="5.1">dead they know it they know how their</text>
  <text start="103.57" dur="5.1">system works they realize it only has a</text>
  <text start="105.79" dur="5.76">certain period of time the life of a</text>
  <text start="108.67" dur="4.23">fayette system only lasts about 40 to 45</text>
  <text start="111.55" dur="3.54">years maybe a little bit longer</text>
  <text start="112.9" dur="5.13">depending on how they structure it this</text>
  <text start="115.09" dur="5.61">was structure with petrol using oil to</text>
  <text start="118.03" dur="5.64">back up the dollar we see that China is</text>
  <text start="120.7" dur="6.03">doing the exact same thing but what</text>
  <text start="123.67" dur="5.789">happened was all of a sudden out of the</text>
  <text start="126.73" dur="4.5">2008 crisis crypto currencies were born</text>
  <text start="129.459" dur="4.081">they weren&amp;#39;t popular back then but as</text>
  <text start="131.23" dur="5.49">time went on more and more people got</text>
  <text start="133.54" dur="4.919">into it developers got into it and it</text>
  <text start="136.72" dur="3.48">became larger and large now in the</text>
  <text start="138.459" dur="4.831">beginning they didn&amp;#39;t care too much</text>
  <text start="140.2" dur="5.94">about it all they cared about is their</text>
  <text start="143.29" dur="4.83">system now the cryptocurrency market has</text>
  <text start="146.14" dur="4.08">gotten very very large and a lot of</text>
  <text start="148.12" dur="3.48">people are in it and we can see and we</text>
  <text start="150.22" dur="2.91">mentioned it before a lot of countries</text>
  <text start="151.6" dur="3.81">are looking at this as central banks</text>
  <text start="153.13" dur="4.109">were looking at this saying either we</text>
  <text start="155.41" dur="4.62">want cryptocurrencies or we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="157.239" dur="4.981">cryptocurrencies the central banks they</text>
  <text start="160.03" dur="5.57">don&amp;#39;t want anything that goes up against</text>
  <text start="162.22" dur="7.53">their system and a decentralized</text>
  <text start="165.6" dur="6.34">people&amp;#39;s system where you issue currency</text>
  <text start="169.75" dur="4.65">without interest attached that is</text>
  <text start="171.94" dur="5.31">something they don&amp;#39;t want and they have</text>
  <text start="174.4" dur="4.77">already taken the first step and</text>
  <text start="177.25" dur="3.54">actually maybe even the the fifth step</text>
  <text start="179.17" dur="5.13">but let&amp;#39;s say it&amp;#39;s the first step</text>
  <text start="180.79" dur="6.45">publicly to show that they are going to</text>
  <text start="184.3" dur="4.59">stop the people from what they are doing</text>
  <text start="187.24" dur="3.75">and we&amp;#39;re gonna get into that in a</text>
  <text start="188.89" dur="4.32">little bit later in this report but</text>
  <text start="190.99" dur="4.41">let&amp;#39;s start off with the economic news</text>
  <text start="193.21" dur="4.47">now we&amp;#39;re starting to see that things</text>
  <text start="195.4" dur="6.48">are rapidly deteriorating very very</text>
  <text start="197.68" dur="7.2">quickly and with you Mitch this is the</text>
  <text start="201.88" dur="5.07">people&amp;#39;s confidence in the system it is</text>
  <text start="204.88" dur="5.25">dropped to its lowest since September</text>
  <text start="206.95" dur="5.73">and we can see that current economic</text>
  <text start="210.13" dur="4.74">conditions have slumped to the weakest</text>
  <text start="212.68" dur="4.62">since the election now we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="214.87" dur="4.86">see a lot of things decline at this</text>
  <text start="217.3" dur="5.64">point in time we&amp;#39;re seeing housing</text>
  <text start="219.73" dur="5.76">existing home sales we&amp;#39;re seeing new</text>
  <text start="222.94" dur="5.43">home sales we&amp;#39;re seeing pending home</text>
  <text start="225.49" dur="5.82">sales they are declining we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="228.37" dur="6">retail stores they&amp;#39;re going bankrupt the</text>
  <text start="231.31" dur="5.19">GDP numbers didn&amp;#39;t come in at that 3% or</text>
  <text start="234.37" dur="3.69">over mark yes it came in at around 2.6</text>
  <text start="236.5" dur="3.03">percent but we know this is completely</text>
  <text start="238.06" dur="3.93">manipulated and you can only take the</text>
  <text start="239.53" dur="3.81">manipulation so far because people will</text>
  <text start="241.99" dur="2.91">look at it and say hey wait a minute</text>
  <text start="243.34" dur="4.11">this really doesn&amp;#39;t make sense but of</text>
  <text start="244.9" dur="5.22">course the Atlanta Fed they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="247.45" dur="5.04">out high saying well GDP could be 5.4</text>
  <text start="250.12" dur="4.05">percent right now and of course this is</text>
  <text start="252.49" dur="3.54">in the future which is absolutely</text>
  <text start="254.17" dur="3.96">meaningless all these numbers are</text>
  <text start="256.03" dur="4.74">absolutely ridiculous but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="258.13" dur="4.7">seeing now is that the job numbers have</text>
  <text start="260.77" dur="5.94">come in and the BLS unveiled that</text>
  <text start="262.83" dur="6.07">employers and a 200,000 jobs and they</text>
  <text start="266.71" dur="4.26">also said that the average hourly</text>
  <text start="268.9" dur="4.44">earnings for workers rose about 2.9</text>
  <text start="270.97" dur="7.29">percent from a year earlier from 26</text>
  <text start="273.34" dur="7.02">dollars and 74 cents to from $25.99 now</text>
  <text start="278.26" dur="5.01">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="280.36" dur="7.04">heading into the tax period now during</text>
  <text start="283.27" dur="6.96">this time usually accounting payrolls</text>
  <text start="287.4" dur="5.16">usually increase because it&amp;#39;s the tax</text>
  <text start="290.23" dur="6.09">period and people hire more individuals</text>
  <text start="292.56" dur="8.2">because to handle the tax accounting but</text>
  <text start="296.32" dur="7.05">we saw this actually fall it declined in</text>
  <text start="300.76" dur="5.46">January by 10,000 jobs which is very</text>
  <text start="303.37" dur="4.5">very odd but retail where we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="306.22" dur="5.64">what these stores go bankrupt in stores</text>
  <text start="307.87" dur="6.12">closing they added 15,000 jobs and the</text>
  <text start="311.86" dur="6.36">food services industry pwith shrink</text>
  <text start="313.99" dur="5.84">places they added 31,000 jobs now we</text>
  <text start="318.22" dur="4.85">need to understand</text>
  <text start="319.83" dur="6.45">how this works when they say Oh retail</text>
  <text start="323.07" dur="5.82">added yes every time there&amp;#39;s a part-time</text>
  <text start="326.28" dur="6.75">job that is added it counts as a</text>
  <text start="328.89" dur="6.78">full-time job those jobs that are being</text>
  <text start="333.03" dur="5.52">lost in the retail industry and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="335.67" dur="4.8">part-time jobs unless they&amp;#39;re making a</text>
  <text start="338.55" dur="3.57">certain dollar amount unless they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="340.47" dur="4.44">working a certain hour net varies from</text>
  <text start="342.12" dur="7.65">state to state they are not counted as</text>
  <text start="344.91" dur="7.47">losing a job it&amp;#39;s very misleading when</text>
  <text start="349.77" dur="4.68">they use these type of calculations they</text>
  <text start="352.38" dur="5.13">did this on purpose to make it look like</text>
  <text start="354.45" dur="7.08">the job numbers are always great oh look</text>
  <text start="357.51" dur="6.57">we added 15,000 retail jobs but they</text>
  <text start="361.53" dur="5.1">didn&amp;#39;t record you know a hundred</text>
  <text start="364.08" dur="4.53">thousand were just lost because those</text>
  <text start="366.63" dur="3.36">were all part-time small jobs nobody</text>
  <text start="368.61" dur="3.72">really cares about them they didn&amp;#39;t meet</text>
  <text start="369.99" dur="3.36">the requirements of the number of hours</text>
  <text start="372.33" dur="4.01">they worked and how much they were</text>
  <text start="373.35" dur="5.34">getting paid so they&amp;#39;re just not counted</text>
  <text start="376.34" dur="4.09">so when we look at this we need to</text>
  <text start="378.69" dur="3.87">understand that these numbers are</text>
  <text start="380.43" dur="3.99">completely meaningless at this point</text>
  <text start="382.56" dur="4.23">unless you look deep deep into the</text>
  <text start="384.42" dur="4.41">numbers now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="386.79" dur="5.55">about all of this is that they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="388.83" dur="7.08">that average hourly earnings well it</text>
  <text start="392.34" dur="6.81">that they&amp;#39;ve increased during this</text>
  <text start="395.91" dur="6.99">period and if you look closer at the</text>
  <text start="399.15" dur="5.46">data the only reason why average hourly</text>
  <text start="402.9" dur="5.07">earnings rose is because the total</text>
  <text start="404.61" dur="6.27">weekly hours work posted a relatively</text>
  <text start="407.97" dur="5.4">steep decline dropping from thirty four</text>
  <text start="410.88" dur="5.37">point five in December to thirty four</text>
  <text start="413.37" dur="5.4">point three in January a two point nine</text>
  <text start="416.25" dur="6.24">percent drop from the thirty four point</text>
  <text start="418.77" dur="6.78">four last January so average weekly</text>
  <text start="422.49" dur="4.95">earnings actually declined from December</text>
  <text start="425.55" dur="4.02">dropping from nine hundred nineteen and</text>
  <text start="427.44" dur="4.2">forty three cents to nine hundred and</text>
  <text start="429.57" dur="4.65">seventeen and eighteen cents from</text>
  <text start="431.64" dur="4.08">December to January which in turn meant</text>
  <text start="434.22" dur="4.05">no breakout in the average weekly</text>
  <text start="435.72" dur="5.16">earnings which rose a far more modest</text>
  <text start="438.27" dur="4.79">two point six and in fact decline from</text>
  <text start="440.88" dur="4.98">recent prints above three percent and</text>
  <text start="443.06" dur="6.46">when we look at this we can see that yet</text>
  <text start="445.86" dur="6.66">these numbers aren&amp;#39;t exactly what their</text>
  <text start="449.52" dur="5.13">give what they&amp;#39;re trying to show</text>
  <text start="452.52" dur="3.57">and we need to look at the numbers very</text>
  <text start="454.65" dur="3.139">very closely and what is really</text>
  <text start="456.09" dur="5.759">happening here now harley-davidson</text>
  <text start="457.789" dur="5.951">they&amp;#39;re cutting about 800 US jobs now of</text>
  <text start="461.849" dur="3.54">course if everyone&amp;#39;s gonna say they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="463.74" dur="2.97">buying all their motorcycles on Amazon</text>
  <text start="465.389" dur="3.06">which is absolutely ridiculous or</text>
  <text start="466.71" dur="3.419">they&amp;#39;re going online to buy their</text>
  <text start="468.449" dur="4.28">motorcycles know what harley-davidson is</text>
  <text start="470.129" dur="6.051">saying is that the fourth-quarter sales</text>
  <text start="472.729" dur="6.521">they fell by nine point six percent I</text>
  <text start="476.18" dur="5.62">mean the entire United States fell by</text>
  <text start="479.25" dur="6.389">11.1% international retail sales filed</text>
  <text start="481.8" dur="6.66">by seven point seven percent it tells</text>
  <text start="485.639" dur="4.861">you that we have a problem in the</text>
  <text start="488.46" dur="5.28">industry just like Teavana where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="490.5" dur="4.65">closing all their stores and they sell t</text>
  <text start="493.74" dur="3.989">it&amp;#39;s not because it&amp;#39;s moving to online</text>
  <text start="495.15" dur="4.169">it&amp;#39;s because people aren&amp;#39;t going out and</text>
  <text start="497.729" dur="3.901">purchasing this people aren&amp;#39;t going out</text>
  <text start="499.319" dur="5.461">and purchasing more more cycles it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="501.63" dur="5.55">same exact thing and they&amp;#39;re not moving</text>
  <text start="504.78" dur="5.66">they&amp;#39;re not going online to get this</text>
  <text start="507.18" dur="5.969">stuff it&amp;#39;s because sales are poor and</text>
  <text start="510.44" dur="5.61">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="513.149" dur="5.461">different parts of the retail sector</text>
  <text start="516.05" dur="5.5">they&amp;#39;re gonna be showing us that yeah</text>
  <text start="518.61" dur="6.75">this online sales thing not really that</text>
  <text start="521.55" dur="6.36">true yes online sales it is increasing</text>
  <text start="525.36" dur="5.87">it&amp;#39;s getting more popular but it hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="527.91" dur="7.799">taken over the brick-and-mortar stores</text>
  <text start="531.23" dur="6.58">not even close now we see core capital</text>
  <text start="535.709" dur="3.781">expenditures they tumble twice as much</text>
  <text start="537.81" dur="5.519">as initially expected in December</text>
  <text start="539.49" dur="6.11">dropping from 0.6% month a month this is</text>
  <text start="543.329" dur="5.07">the biggest drop since September of 2016</text>
  <text start="545.6" dur="7.39">the preliminary prim for December was</text>
  <text start="548.399" dur="7.951">0.3% but the final came in around 0.6%</text>
  <text start="552.99" dur="6.95">and it was a lot larger than they</text>
  <text start="556.35" dur="5.79">thought now we know leading up to the</text>
  <text start="559.94" dur="4.48">2008-2009 crisis which really never</text>
  <text start="562.14" dur="4.77">ended we knew there were companies that</text>
  <text start="564.42" dur="4.409">were in trouble Bear Stearns Lehman AIG</text>
  <text start="566.91" dur="4.59">many many more many needed to bail out</text>
  <text start="568.829" dur="6.841">some don&amp;#39;t even exist anymore and two</text>
  <text start="571.5" dur="6.95">weeks ago out in the UK Karelian they</text>
  <text start="575.67" dur="6.27">basically imploded on themselves and</text>
  <text start="578.45" dur="7.18">it&amp;#39;s a complete disaster now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="581.94" dur="4.43">interesting is this was the first</text>
  <text start="585.63" dur="4.57">company</text>
  <text start="586.37" dur="7.11">where this was a major major problem</text>
  <text start="590.2" dur="5.29">where we&amp;#39;re seeing that this company</text>
  <text start="593.48" dur="4.799">wasn&amp;#39;t doing as well as everyone thought</text>
  <text start="595.49" dur="9.12">they were doing there could be another</text>
  <text start="598.279" dur="9.721">company in the UK called capita now this</text>
  <text start="604.61" dur="6.09">is an outsourcing giant with 70,000</text>
  <text start="608" dur="6.029">employees and what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="610.7" dur="6.06">about this company it is one of UK&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="614.029" dur="4.321">government&amp;#39;s biggest outsourcing firm</text>
  <text start="616.76" dur="4.68">with contracts to provide services to</text>
  <text start="618.35" dur="5.73">government entities such as NHS cleaning</text>

  <text start="629.02" dur="5.35">on Wednesday its shares tumbled from 47</text>
  <text start="632.27" dur="5.13">point five to a 15-year low after its</text>
  <text start="634.37" dur="5.67">new CEO John Lewis slashed profit</text>
  <text start="637.4" dur="4.62">forecasts announced plans to tap the</text>
  <text start="640.04" dur="4.59">capital market for 700 million and</text>
  <text start="642.02" dur="4.83">suspend and suspended a dividend that</text>
  <text start="644.63" dur="4.98">was worth more than 200 million to</text>
  <text start="646.85" dur="5.34">shareholders last year but whatever the</text>
  <text start="649.61" dur="4.76">government might say there is a striking</text>
  <text start="652.19" dur="5.61">resemblance between the two companies</text>
  <text start="654.37" dur="5.26">Karelian and capita both of them are</text>
  <text start="657.8" dur="5.039">massively dependent on government</text>
  <text start="659.63" dur="5.94">contracts in the last two years alone it</text>
  <text start="662.839" dur="5.761">was awarded 226 public sector contracts</text>
  <text start="665.57" dur="5.28">ten times more than Karelian making it</text>
  <text start="668.6" dur="5.85">the biggest supplier of local government</text>
  <text start="670.85" dur="6.48">services in the country now like</text>
  <text start="674.45" dur="6.15">Karelian capita is maths massively in</text>
  <text start="677.33" dur="6.27">debt with an estimated 1.1 billion</text>
  <text start="680.6" dur="5.25">of funds outstanding and like Karelian</text>
  <text start="683.6" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s been exceptionally generous with</text>
  <text start="685.85" dur="5.1">its dividend policy in recent years now</text>
  <text start="688.67" dur="6.3">capita is doing the same thing as</text>
  <text start="690.95" dur="6.78">Karelian trillion is accused of doing</text>
  <text start="694.97" dur="5.04">borrow money and sell off assets in</text>
  <text start="697.73" dur="5.82">order pay its dividends in direct</text>
  <text start="700.01" dur="6.06">contravention of UK law like Karelian</text>
  <text start="703.55" dur="5.34">capita hat capita has a pension</text>
  <text start="706.07" dur="5.61">shortfall estimated to be around 380</text>
  <text start="708.89" dur="5.4">million and when we look at all the</text>
  <text start="711.68" dur="4.26">similarities between these two companies</text>
  <text start="714.29" dur="2.86">and how they have these government</text>
  <text start="715.94" dur="3.82">contracts</text>
  <text start="717.15" dur="5.85">I mean capita could be in real trouble</text>
  <text start="719.76" dur="5.76">here and if we think back to 2008 in</text>
  <text start="723" dur="5.91">prior to 2008 there were companies that</text>
  <text start="725.52" dur="6.06">were having problems in the US and all</text>
  <text start="728.91" dur="4.92">of a sudden more companies came out and</text>
  <text start="731.58" dur="5.19">they need bailouts because it affected</text>
  <text start="733.83" dur="5.16">everything this could have the same</text>
  <text start="736.77" dur="4.77">effect so this is something that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="738.99" dur="4.5">watching and all of a sudden we might</text>
  <text start="741.54" dur="4.26">hear something come out in the news</text>
  <text start="743.49" dur="5.4">maybe in the next couple of weeks or so</text>
  <text start="745.8" dur="7.59">now we talked about how the central</text>
  <text start="748.89" dur="8.25">banks how they want control of the</text>
  <text start="753.39" dur="7.02">entire economic system and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="757.14" dur="6.93">like the cryptocurrency market they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="760.41" dur="5.91">cracking down on cryptos now how are</text>
  <text start="764.07" dur="5.04">they cracking down it&amp;#39;s open and free</text>
  <text start="766.32" dur="5.4">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s decentralized they they they</text>
  <text start="769.11" dur="5.43">can&amp;#39;t do it well they kind of can and</text>
  <text start="771.72" dur="5.04">they can try to do it I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="774.54" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;ll be successful but they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="776.76" dur="6.63">give it their all to make sure they shut</text>
  <text start="779.37" dur="6.45">down the people from starting a new type</text>
  <text start="783.39" dur="5.3">of currency they don&amp;#39;t want this to</text>
  <text start="785.82" dur="4.2">happen they need full control now</text>
  <text start="788.69" dur="5.26">coinbase</text>
  <text start="790.02" dur="7.77">is an exchange a Bitcoin exchange it has</text>
  <text start="793.95" dur="6.69">litecoin Bitcoin Bitcoin cash aetherium</text>
  <text start="797.79" dur="4.8">and it sent out notices declines</text>
  <text start="800.64" dur="4.2">informing them that purchasing</text>
  <text start="802.59" dur="7.11">cryptocurrencies on credit would now be</text>
  <text start="804.84" dur="7.59">prohibitively expensive hmm why would</text>
  <text start="809.7" dur="7.58">that be because the banks have started</text>
  <text start="812.43" dur="8.76">to put fees on the purchases of</text>
  <text start="817.28" dur="8.41">cryptocurrencies now they&amp;#39;ve taken this</text>
  <text start="821.19" dur="6.69">a little bit further what they have done</text>
  <text start="825.69" dur="3.78">these different banking systems which</text>
  <text start="827.88" dur="4.02">are tied into the central banking system</text>
  <text start="829.47" dur="4.11">and believe me the banking systems do</text>
  <text start="831.9" dur="4.2">not like the cryptocurrency market</text>
  <text start="833.58" dur="5.82">because why they&amp;#39;re not needed there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="836.1" dur="7.26">no reason for a bank capital one right</text>
  <text start="839.4" dur="5.73">now has decided to ban customers from</text>
  <text start="843.36" dur="3.71">using credit cards to purchase Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="845.13" dur="5.13">or coins on the etherium blockchain</text>
  <text start="847.07" dur="4.04">discover they announced it would</text>
  <text start="850.26" dur="5.14">likewise</text>
  <text start="851.11" dur="7.23">block Bitcoin transactions and according</text>
  <text start="855.4" dur="5.25">to an internal memo to employees the</text>
  <text start="858.34" dur="4.68">second-largest u.s. bank said it will</text>
  <text start="860.65" dur="5.81">begin declining credit card transactions</text>
  <text start="863.02" dur="6.09">with known crypto currencies exchanges</text>
  <text start="866.46" dur="4.81">Charlotte North Carolina based bank</text>
  <text start="869.11" dur="5.64">confirmed the bank will no longer allow</text>
  <text start="871.27" dur="8.07">the transactions JP Morgan is going to</text>
  <text start="874.75" dur="7.56">halt crypto purchases on Saturday what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="879.34" dur="5.25">going on here they don&amp;#39;t want people</text>
  <text start="882.31" dur="3.99">going out and purchasing crypto</text>
  <text start="884.59" dur="3.84">currencies using credit cards have you</text>
  <text start="886.3" dur="4.83">ever heard of anything like this well</text>
  <text start="888.43" dur="5.93">except for maybe weapons they tried to</text>
  <text start="891.13" dur="5.85">do that but they don&amp;#39;t want you to use</text>
  <text start="894.36" dur="5.95">their credit cards to purchase</text>
  <text start="896.98" dur="5.52">cryptocurrency now of course you can use</text>
  <text start="900.31" dur="4.38">other methods to purchase cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="902.5" dur="4.95">they can&amp;#39;t stop you from doing that or</text>
  <text start="904.69" dur="5.79">can they but the reason why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="907.45" dur="7.64">doing this is they&amp;#39;re trying to shut out</text>
  <text start="910.48" dur="7.68">people from purchasing on the blockchain</text>
  <text start="915.09" dur="5.35">other countries are getting rid of it</text>
  <text start="918.16" dur="5.64">completely other countries are embracing</text>
  <text start="920.44" dur="5.7">it but there is a silver lining to all</text>
  <text start="923.8" dur="5.04">of this there was a survey taken and</text>
  <text start="926.14" dur="4.77">they asked you know those individuals</text>
  <text start="928.84" dur="3.51">that are purchasing Bitcoin or any other</text>
  <text start="930.91" dur="4.2">type of crypto currencies how many</text>
  <text start="932.35" dur="5.01">people use credit cards well it looks</text>
  <text start="935.11" dur="4.83">like only about 18% of the people are</text>
  <text start="937.36" dur="6.75">using credit cards 33% are using debit</text>
  <text start="939.94" dur="6.51">cards bank transfers are 18% and when we</text>
  <text start="944.11" dur="5.7">look at this 82% of all crypto purchases</text>
  <text start="946.45" dur="7.95">were not made using a credit card now</text>
  <text start="949.81" dur="6.51">this is the first attempt of the central</text>
  <text start="954.4" dur="3.96">bank the banking system to try to</text>
  <text start="956.32" dur="4.26">control the economic system to try to</text>
  <text start="958.36" dur="3.84">control the currency because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="960.58" dur="5.13">want to give this up whatsoever</text>
  <text start="962.2" dur="6.56">we also heard that when people are</text>
  <text start="965.71" dur="6.6">trying to cash out of crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="968.76" dur="5.77">banks are denying the cash to be</text>
  <text start="972.31" dur="5.55">deposited into their accounts into the</text>
  <text start="974.53" dur="6.84">bank so this is very interesting how the</text>
  <text start="977.86" dur="6.75">bank&amp;#39;s they don&amp;#39;t want people purchasing</text>
  <text start="981.37" dur="5.55">or depositing the proceeds</text>
  <text start="984.61" dur="4.56">from the cryptocurrencies into the</text>
  <text start="986.92" dur="6.18">banking system it sounds a little</text>
  <text start="989.17" dur="6.589">ridiculous but this is their agenda this</text>
  <text start="993.1" dur="5.579">is the beginning phases of their agenda</text>
  <text start="995.759" dur="5.94">the first part of it was to say that</text>
  <text start="998.679" dur="5.13">crypto currencies like the wanna cry</text>
  <text start="1001.699" dur="6.01">malware that was sent around the</text>
  <text start="1003.809" dur="7.88">ransomware that was to say look bad</text>
  <text start="1007.709" dur="7.021">countries use this criminals use this</text>
  <text start="1011.689" dur="5.231">terrorists use this and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1014.73" dur="6.24">to push this agenda that</text>
  <text start="1016.92" dur="7.919">cryptocurrencies aren&amp;#39;t good the second</text>
  <text start="1020.97" dur="6.449">part was well maybe we need to maybe we</text>
  <text start="1024.839" dur="5.911">need to have everyone list their name</text>
  <text start="1027.419" dur="4.65">their address and everything else when</text>
  <text start="1030.75" dur="3.419">they&amp;#39;re purchasing this this is</text>
  <text start="1032.069" dur="4.171">happening in South Korea now remember</text>
  <text start="1034.169" dur="4.11">these are all test cases where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1036.24" dur="3.39">trying to figure out how to control</text>
  <text start="1038.279" dur="3.54">those who are allowing you to do this</text>
  <text start="1039.63" dur="4.62">but eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="1041.819" dur="4.35">each one of these banks are going to say</text>
  <text start="1044.25" dur="3.689">you know something we can&amp;#39;t have this</text>
  <text start="1046.169" dur="3.301">anymore because we don&amp;#39;t know where this</text>
  <text start="1047.939" dur="4.291">currency is coming from because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1049.47" dur="4.949">anonymous we don&amp;#39;t have control over it</text>
  <text start="1052.23" dur="6.419">and I think what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="1054.419" dur="7.951">right now is build on the idea that they</text>
  <text start="1058.649" dur="7.231">will need control later on and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1062.37" dur="6.33">want government to pass laws to say we</text>
  <text start="1065.88" dur="4.71">need control of all of this so we can</text>
  <text start="1068.7" dur="4.469">see already things are already happening</text>
  <text start="1070.59" dur="6.059">and they&amp;#39;re gonna push this agenda even</text>
  <text start="1073.169" dur="5.581">further because they want control of the</text>
  <text start="1076.649" dur="4.14">system listen everyone thanks a lot for</text>
  <text start="1078.75" dur="5.36">listening be well be safe and especially</text>
