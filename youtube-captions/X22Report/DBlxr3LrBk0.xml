  <text start="306.12" dur="3.78">spread fast there are more and more</text>
  <text start="308.01" dur="4.17">people getting it and we should be very</text>
  <text start="309.9" dur="4.35">concerned about what&amp;#39;s going on and we</text>
  <text start="312.18" dur="4.35">could see all of this is happening all</text>
  <text start="314.25" dur="3.87">at once and now Congress is taking a</text>
  <text start="316.53" dur="4.2">break and they won&amp;#39;t be back until after</text>
  <text start="318.12" dur="4.89">Labor Day now we saw the same thing play</text>
  <text start="320.73" dur="4.41">out back in August but we have much much</text>
  <text start="323.01" dur="4.8">more going on right now they are pushing</text>
  <text start="325.14" dur="4.56">the recovery very very hard right now to</text>
  <text start="327.81" dur="5.4">convince the American people that we are</text>
  <text start="329.7" dur="6.27">in an economic recovery so I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="333.21" dur="5.46">surprised in the next 30 days right now</text>
  <text start="335.97" dur="5.94">if we see some type of major an event a</text>
  <text start="338.67" dur="5.88">major event I mean everything is primed</text>
  <text start="341.91" dur="5.09">ready to go and it seems like they might</text>
  <text start="344.55" dur="4.65">be pushing this now it might move into</text>
  <text start="347" dur="4.3">September the first week or so when</text>
  <text start="349.2" dur="4.26">Congress might you know starts filtering</text>
  <text start="351.3" dur="4.7">back after Labor Day everyone takes</text>
  <text start="353.46" dur="4.68">about a week or so to get all back into</text>
  <text start="356" dur="4.51">Washington so we might see something</text>
  <text start="358.14" dur="3.87">occur at that period of time or right in</text>
  <text start="360.51" dur="5.46">August and I think the president right</text>
  <text start="362.01" dur="6.33">now is looking to do something with</text>
  <text start="365.97" dur="4.77">immigration in August because he knows</text>
  <text start="368.34" dur="4.95">Congress is out of there he has a pen he</text>
  <text start="370.74" dur="4.71">has a paper and he is ready to go so we</text>
  <text start="373.29" dur="5.34">can see all this is ramping up at this</text>
  <text start="375.45" dur="5.85">time and we have to be on the lookout of</text>
  <text start="378.63" dur="6.72">what is going on and we can see right</text>
  <text start="381.3" dur="5.91">now at all the indicators are looking at</text>
  <text start="385.35" dur="2.76">this situation that something is</text>
  <text start="387.21" dur="2.82">definitely going to happen</text>
  <text start="388.11" dur="3.72">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="390.03" dur="4.02">news now what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="391.83" dur="5.7">the Department of Justice right now is</text>
  <text start="394.05" dur="5.7">going after GM and the subprime auto</text>
  <text start="397.53" dur="3.99">loans now we understand all the</text>
  <text start="399.75" dur="3.84">automobile manufacturers are offering</text>
  <text start="401.52" dur="5.13">subprimes are trying to get anyone in</text>
  <text start="403.59" dur="3.36">with a heartbeat to purchase a car this</text>
  <text start="406.65" dur="3.6">is</text>
  <text start="406.95" dur="5.61">how the spreading version of the GDP was</text>
  <text start="410.25" dur="6.3">pushed up because they were just giving</text>
  <text start="412.56" dur="5.64">anyone with a sub with with harpie alone</text>
  <text start="416.55" dur="4.14">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="418.2" dur="4.62">delinquencies are rising very quickly</text>
  <text start="420.69" dur="5.01">those people who are taking up the loans</text>
  <text start="422.82" dur="4.74">cannot afford these cars and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="425.7" dur="4.35">delinquent on their loans and a lot of</text>
  <text start="427.56" dur="5.99">them are defaulting on it also so we can</text>
  <text start="430.05" dur="7.14">see right now the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="433.55" dur="5.89">sent out a subpoena GM received it and</text>
  <text start="437.19" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s relating to subprime automobile</text>
  <text start="439.44" dur="4.89">loan contracts they&amp;#39;re also subpoenaing</text>
  <text start="441.66" dur="5.49">GM for warranties on underwriting</text>
  <text start="444.33" dur="5.1">criteria so we can see all this is</text>
  <text start="447.15" dur="4.4">starting to fall apart and if we look</text>
  <text start="449.43" dur="4.71">across the globe we see other countries</text>
  <text start="451.55" dur="7.99">starting to fall apart we see Portugal</text>
  <text start="454.14" dur="7.14">we see Bulgaria we see France many</text>
  <text start="459.54" dur="3.42">countries now and this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="461.28" dur="3.39">domino effect it&amp;#39;s all going to occur</text>
  <text start="462.96" dur="3.69">and all these countries are going to</text>
  <text start="464.67" dur="4.05">collapse one by one as we go down the</text>
  <text start="466.65" dur="5.73">line and this is why they&amp;#39;re trying so</text>
  <text start="468.72" dur="6.15">hard to create some type of an event now</text>
  <text start="472.38" dur="5.19">we understand Russia sign the Eurasian</text>
  <text start="474.87" dur="4.47">Economic Union with Belarus Kazakhstan</text>
  <text start="477.57" dur="4.71">and right now they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="479.34" dur="5.34">creating one type of common currency</text>
  <text start="482.28" dur="5.19">unit to be used throughout these</text>
  <text start="484.68" dur="6.93">countries right now they&amp;#39;re using a mix</text>
  <text start="487.47" dur="6.84">of about 50% of rubles 40% of the US</text>
  <text start="491.61" dur="5.31">dollar and the other the other 8 to 9</text>
  <text start="494.31" dur="4.2">percent is in Euros and then the rest</text>
  <text start="496.92" dur="3.6">are just other currencies and it looks</text>
  <text start="498.51" dur="5.01">like they&amp;#39;re looking for a common</text>
  <text start="500.52" dur="6.3">currency to use and believe me it is not</text>
  <text start="503.52" dur="6.42">going to be the dollar now we understand</text>
  <text start="506.82" dur="5.67">that Obama care is completely not for</text>
  <text start="509.94" dur="5.34">the people I mean there&amp;#39;s taxes</text>
  <text start="512.49" dur="5.48">interwove interwove in&amp;#39; into obamacare</text>
  <text start="515.28" dur="4.949">we have penalties on obamacare</text>
  <text start="517.97" dur="4.03">deductibles are very very high</text>
  <text start="520.229" dur="3.961">they really don&amp;#39;t give benefits to the</text>
  <text start="522" dur="4.65">people and the Affordable Care Act we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="524.19" dur="4.2">seeing premiums go up and here&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="526.65" dur="4.95">case where premiums are going up in</text>
  <text start="528.39" dur="5.58">Florida what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the</text>
  <text start="531.6" dur="3.39">exchange rates are going up by seventeen</text>
  <text start="533.97" dur="3.15">point six percent</text>
  <text start="534.99" dur="4.17">so this Affordable Care Act is really</text>
  <text start="537.12" dur="3.54">becoming very very expensive and you</text>
  <text start="539.16" dur="5.609">have to remember their scheme</text>
  <text start="540.66" dur="6.719">is to have a lot of young people into</text>
  <text start="544.769" dur="5.49">the system those who are graduating high</text>
  <text start="547.379" dur="4.65">school or graduating college come out</text>
  <text start="550.259" dur="3.06">and say you know what let me just buy</text>
  <text start="552.029" dur="4.201">that health insurance because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="553.319" dur="5.161">really cheap and now I can insure myself</text>
  <text start="556.23" dur="4.229">but guess what those college graduates</text>
  <text start="558.48" dur="3.87">and high school graduates are having a</text>
  <text start="560.459" dur="3.841">very tough time finding a job but 80</text>
  <text start="562.35" dur="4.02">percent coming out of college cannot</text>
  <text start="564.3" dur="3.63">find work today most of them are living</text>
  <text start="566.37" dur="3.449">with their parents a lot of them are</text>
  <text start="567.93" dur="4.199">getting part-time work and the last</text>
  <text start="569.819" dur="4.411">thing on their minds is health insurance</text>
  <text start="572.129" dur="7.77">and now of course the older population</text>
  <text start="574.23" dur="7.469">is reaching the age of 55 and older and</text>
  <text start="579.899" dur="3.18">they want the health insurance because</text>
  <text start="581.699" dur="3.93">their health is starting to deteriorate</text>
  <text start="583.079" dur="4.711">as time goes on and they&amp;#39;re the ones who</text>
  <text start="585.629" dur="4.051">are purchasing it now the system can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="587.79" dur="3.33">keep up with this and they&amp;#39;re hoping</text>
  <text start="589.68" dur="3.48">that the younger people we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="591.12" dur="4.259">cover the older people but that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="593.16" dur="4.59">working out and right now this is why</text>
  <text start="595.379" dur="5.491">they need to continually raise the rates</text>
  <text start="597.75" dur="6.24">because there&amp;#39;s a huge huge older</text>
  <text start="600.87" dur="6.779">population that is using Obama care and</text>
  <text start="603.99" dur="5.909">the younger and middle class pretty much</text>
  <text start="607.649" dur="3.781">not going for it and we can see Obama</text>
  <text start="609.899" dur="4.231">care is not doing what it was supposed</text>
  <text start="611.43" dur="6.149">to do and it&amp;#39;s completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="614.13" dur="5.16">and collapsing now let&amp;#39;s move on to</text>
  <text start="617.579" dur="4.171">what&amp;#39;s going on in the border and it</text>
  <text start="619.29" dur="3.989">looks like there&amp;#39;s a leaked intelligence</text>
  <text start="621.75" dur="4.17">analysis from the Customs and Border</text>
  <text start="623.279" dur="4.29">Protection reveals that the exact number</text>
  <text start="625.92" dur="3.63">of illegal immigrants entering and</text>

  <text start="762.9" dur="5.97">looks like the sovereign citizen has</text>

  <text start="804.87" dur="3.14">know what I don&amp;#39;t think what the</text>

  <text start="840.32" dur="5.1">they don&amp;#39;t care about that remember</text>
  <text start="841.93" dur="6.58">Harry Reid Obama and the rest of them</text>

  <text start="848.51" dur="5.52">by law no I&amp;#39;m sorry that is completely</text>
  <text start="852.08" dur="4.11">wrong the United States is not ruled by</text>

  <text start="873.44" dur="5.34">people we have the right to remove them</text>
  <text start="876.17" dur="5.91">so this country is not a rule of laws</text>
  <text start="878.78" dur="5.94">it&amp;#39;s a rule of the people they are</text>
  <text start="882.08" dur="4.65">creating laws to control the people and</text>
  <text start="884.72" dur="5.7">this is why they keep using this over</text>

  <text start="1021.76" dur="4.86">a nation that doesn&amp;#39;t make anything and</text>
  <text start="1024.549" dur="3.89">said in an interview with The Economist</text>

  <text start="1403.85" dur="6.72">play this up even further now it looks</text>
  <text start="1407.39" dur="5.37">like intelligence analysis analysts are</text>
  <text start="1410.57" dur="4.23">out there and they&amp;#39;re calling out Obama</text>

  <text start="1442.07" dur="5.31">whatsoever there is absolutely no reason</text>

  <text start="1829.69" dur="3.66">it looks like they closed the tunnels</text>
  <text start="1831.22" dur="4.56">down and what they think they&amp;#39;ve done is</text>
  <text start="1833.35" dur="4.26">stop them from getting outside of the</text>

  <text start="1900.82" dur="6.089">pushing the government back now it looks</text>
  <text start="1903.97" dur="5.61">like the Islamic state which is</text>
  <text start="1906.909" dur="5.52">controlled by the u.s. Israel UK and</text>

  <text start="1926.11" dur="7.59">those ships were off the coast of Texas</text>
  <text start="1928.57" dur="6.78">and also a lot of these these or this</text>

  <text start="1944.83" dur="3.929">into Ukraine a ship moves come into</text>
  <text start="1946.779" dur="4.921">Texas and of course the UN is saying</text>

  <text start="1951.7" dur="4.559">against the law Baghdad is screaming out</text>
  <text start="1954.37" dur="4.409">all oil sales have to go through Baghdad</text>

  <text start="1979.87" dur="4.919">is a false flag they&amp;#39;re really building</text>

  <text start="1984.789" dur="6.86">as they keep playing this up the numbers</text>
  <text start="1988.179" dur="7.83">are going to be pretty much inflated</text>
  <text start="1991.649" dur="6.671">inflated very very high so what are we</text>

  <text start="2006.24" dur="5.549">not the Ebola outbreak and now that is a</text>

  <text start="2114.089" dur="5.73">realize about Ebola it seems like from</text>
  <text start="2117.24" dur="4.92">the patent which I Dabu seven has</text>
  <text start="2119.819" dur="4.441">pointed out and there was a huge about a</text>
  <text start="2122.16" dur="5.01">seven million dollar grant that was</text>

  <text start="2135.15" dur="4.53">it looks like from this patent when you</text>
  <text start="2138.21" dur="4.58">read it over and you take a look at it</text>
  <text start="2139.68" dur="5.97">it looks like Ebola is being weaponized</text>
  <text start="2142.79" dur="5.979">it&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re trying to create an air</text>

  <text start="2148.769" dur="5.06">the virus does not live very long</text>
  <text start="2151.319" dur="5.371">outside of the human or animal host and</text>

  <text start="2159.24" dur="5.759">you see a bola in Africa it has to be</text>
  <text start="2162.089" dur="4.5">humid it has to be hot and once it hits</text>
  <text start="2164.999" dur="5.401">the United States air conditioning</text>
  <text start="2166.589" dur="6.901">pretty much the cool cold air pretty</text>

  <text start="2179.789" dur="7.47">this Ebola is very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="2183.99" dur="5.819">you know they will go to great lengths</text>
  <text start="2187.259" dur="4.59">to create the illusion that this patent</text>
  <text start="2189.809" dur="5.04">is for the creation of a vaccine to</text>
  <text start="2191.849" dur="5.881">protect against Ebola but you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2194.849" dur="8.4">create a vaccine for a virus unless it</text>
  <text start="2197.73" dur="8.76">is for that specific virus it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="2203.249" dur="6.75">simple you have to create the specific</text>
  <text start="2206.49" dur="5.279">virus in order for the vaccine to work</text>
  <text start="2209.999" dur="3.99">now if there&amp;#39;s a different strangers</text>
  <text start="2211.769" dur="4.83">like in the flu which is a virus they</text>
  <text start="2213.989" dur="4.411">can&amp;#39;t create a vaccine because there are</text>
  <text start="2216.599" dur="3.781">many many different strains of the flu</text>

  <text start="2220.38" dur="6.75">a flu shot during that year they need to</text>
  <text start="2224.849" dur="5.16">know what strain of the virus is and of</text>
  <text start="2227.13" dur="5.699">course they normally miss because they</text>
  <text start="2230.009" dur="5.371">have no ability to know what it is</text>
  <text start="2232.829" dur="6.17">unless they&amp;#39;re putting that strain out</text>
  <text start="2235.38" dur="6.84">there and what&amp;#39;s going on right now is</text>
  <text start="2238.999" dur="6.09">that it looks like they&amp;#39;ve been trying</text>
  <text start="2242.22" dur="7.079">to weaponize Ebola for quite a while now</text>
  <text start="2245.089" dur="6.43">the patent is for a man-made form of</text>
  <text start="2249.299" dur="5.79">Ebola one that was created by combining</text>
  <text start="2251.519" dur="6.54">several other viruses the Ebola pandemic</text>
  <text start="2255.089" dur="5.01">that is happening right now in the four</text>
  <text start="2258.059" dur="4.23">countries in Africa three which have</text>

  <text start="2262.289" dur="5.401">before Liberia Guinea and Sierra Leone</text>
  <text start="2264.839" dur="4.46">is very blatantly not acting like Ebola</text>
  <text start="2267.69" dur="3.75">outbreaks usually do first off</text>
  <text start="2269.299" dur="3.881">considering the infected numbers that</text>
  <text start="2271.44" dur="3.089">were given in February 2014 at the</text>
  <text start="2273.18" dur="3.839">beginning of this outbreak and the</text>
  <text start="2274.529" dur="3.851">supposed spread of the virus to three</text>
  <text start="2277.019" dur="3.671">other countries</text>
  <text start="2278.38" dur="5.61">enough people have died the Ebola virus</text>
  <text start="2280.69" dur="5.4">works very very fast I know that this is</text>
  <text start="2283.99" dur="5.13">a morbid thing to say but the Ebola</text>
  <text start="2286.09" dur="5.7">virus kills very very quickly with a</text>
  <text start="2289.12" dur="4.56">high mortality rate and if the virus was</text>
  <text start="2291.79" dur="6.24">in a large city center as the media is</text>
  <text start="2293.68" dur="6.6">saying guess what a lot more people</text>
  <text start="2298.03" dur="4.38">would have died it would the mortality</text>
  <text start="2300.28" dur="6.27">rate would have been much much higher</text>
  <text start="2302.41" dur="6.93">and the thing is is that if the virus</text>
  <text start="2306.55" dur="5.49">was being spread through aerosol you</text>
  <text start="2309.34" dur="4.38">know through sneezing and coughing the</text>

  <text start="2313.72" dur="8.4">reporting right now everyone on the</text>
  <text start="2317.95" dur="6.18">plane would be completely infected so</text>
  <text start="2322.12" dur="4.89">right now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2324.13" dur="5.43">playing up a lot of this story to scare</text>
  <text start="2327.01" dur="4.29">everyone and they&amp;#39;re pushing it very</text>
  <text start="2329.56" dur="3.03">very hard one and you always have to</text>
  <text start="2331.3" dur="5.04">look at this one the government comes</text>
  <text start="2332.59" dur="6.42">out and pushes something very very hard</text>
  <text start="2336.34" dur="4.38">and they start doing things very very</text>

  <text start="2346.81" dur="3.87">things just like the Malaysian flight</text>

  <text start="2354.82" dur="2.52">you can see they are doing this right</text>

  <text start="2455.049" dur="5.25">out of hand as time goes on now of</text>
  <text start="2458.319" dur="4.651">course they&amp;#39;re out there pushing that</text>
  <text start="2460.299" dur="4.861">the the US missionary workers who</text>
  <text start="2462.97" dur="4.319">contracted Ebola while fighting the</text>
  <text start="2465.16" dur="4.8">deadly virus in Liberia were treated</text>
  <text start="2467.289" dur="5.671">with this vaccine with this experimental</text>
  <text start="2469.96" dur="5.099">serum and it saved their lives so you</text>
  <text start="2472.96" dur="5.22">can see how they&amp;#39;re pushing this now now</text>
  <text start="2475.059" dur="6.361">if they say yes it worked now we have a</text>
  <text start="2478.18" dur="7.02">vaccine to cure a virus and now we need</text>
  <text start="2481.42" dur="6">to vaccinate everyone in the US and in</text>
  <text start="2485.2" dur="4.95">the world the question is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2487.42" dur="4.98">actually in this vaccine and really is</text>
  <text start="2490.15" dur="5.52">it really curing anything or is this</text>
  <text start="2492.4" dur="6.629">just a some type of hype to actually</text>

  <text start="2499.029" dur="4.441">it for some other reason this thing</text>
  <text start="2501.16" dur="4.349">seems like it&amp;#39;s moving along too quickly</text>
  <text start="2503.47" dur="4.26">there are too many things that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2505.509" dur="7.26">make sense and they&amp;#39;re pushing it very</text>
  <text start="2507.73" dur="7.289">very hard now it looks like 600</text>
  <text start="2512.769" dur="4.53">retailers were hit with some type of</text>
  <text start="2515.019" dur="4.35">malware attack and it&amp;#39;s just perfect</text>
  <text start="2517.299" dur="5.31">timing because they&amp;#39;re trying to pass</text>
  <text start="2519.369" dur="4.65">sisse right now or sis but there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="2522.609" dur="3.031">laws they&amp;#39;re pretty much the same thing</text>
  <text start="2524.019" dur="3.901">one written by Dianne Feinstein the</text>
  <text start="2525.64" dur="4.139">other one written by Mike Rogers but</text>
  <text start="2527.92" dur="3.869">they&amp;#39;re pretty much the same exact law</text>
  <text start="2529.779" dur="4.351">and it seems like every time they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2531.789" dur="4.921">trying to pass a bill all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="2534.13" dur="4.889">retails data is being stolen because</text>
  <text start="2536.71" dur="3.99">they want all the companies to share</text>
  <text start="2539.019" dur="3.75">their data with the government all your</text>
  <text start="2540.7" dur="4.47">private information and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="2542.769" dur="3.211">this happen right now and it seems like</text>
  <text start="2545.17" dur="3.63">there&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="2545.98" dur="5.85">this new malware that&amp;#39;s hitting all of</text>
  <text start="2548.8" dur="6.24">these retailers all at the same time now</text>
  <text start="2551.83" dur="6.27">there is a hacker out there and Ruben</text>
  <text start="2555.04" dur="8.46">Santa Marta he&amp;#39;s out there saying that</text>
  <text start="2558.1" dur="9.72">he can pretty much pack into a passenger</text>
  <text start="2563.5" dur="6.42">jet and pretty much disrupt the</text>
  <text start="2567.82" dur="4.32">satellite communications and change</text>
  <text start="2569.92" dur="5.16">course of planes and do what everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2572.14" dur="5.37">through the onboard Wi-Fi signal and in</text>
  <text start="2575.08" dur="4.44">or the in-flight entertainment he can go</text>
  <text start="2577.51" dur="4.89">through those systems hack into the</text>
  <text start="2579.52" dur="4.8">plane and change certain things with</text>
  <text start="2582.4" dur="3.99">satellite information and this is good</text>
  <text start="2584.32" dur="4.86">to know because if we see a plane off</text>
  <text start="2586.39" dur="5.85">course or something happening we can say</text>
  <text start="2589.18" dur="4.86">this plane might be controlled by you</text>
  <text start="2592.24" dur="3.51">know governmental forces where they</text>
  <text start="2594.04" dur="3.3">hacked into it remote controlling it</text>
  <text start="2595.75" dur="3.99">into a position where they want it to go</text>
  <text start="2597.34" dur="4.86">or changing things and this is</text>
  <text start="2599.74" dur="4.83">definitely something to look out for now</text>
  <text start="2602.2" dur="5.76">like I said this is the month of August</text>
  <text start="2604.57" dur="6.63">where Congress is pretty much on break</text>
  <text start="2607.96" dur="5.7">they&amp;#39;re taking a recess Obama has ruled</text>
  <text start="2611.2" dur="4.89">the land here where you normally at and</text>
  <text start="2613.66" dur="5.28">during this time or moving into</text>
  <text start="2616.09" dur="5.31">September we see some type of an event</text>
  <text start="2618.94" dur="4.38">to occur and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised in</text>
  <text start="2621.4" dur="4.02">the next 30 days and it seems like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2623.32" dur="2.76">a high probability that something will</text>
  <text start="2625.42" dur="2.4">happen</text>
