  <text start="91.22" dur="4.35">down the economy in 2020 they were going</text>
  <text start="94.07" dur="3.6">to turn this whole thing around this is</text>
  <text start="95.57" dur="3.93">why you saw all the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="97.67" dur="4.98">articles talking about the recession in</text>
  <text start="99.5" dur="4.8">2020 q told us that don&amp;#39;t worry they</text>
  <text start="102.65" dur="3.93">have a plan in place and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="104.3" dur="3.53">to reverse this now how did they reverse</text>
  <text start="106.58" dur="3.27">this this was all done through</text>
  <text start="107.83" dur="4.93">statistics by pumping up the stock</text>
  <text start="109.85" dur="6.81">market by making the numbers look great</text>
  <text start="112.76" dur="6.27">and we know that the Fed can&amp;#39;t control</text>
  <text start="116.66" dur="4.89">if the economy stays up or if the</text>
  <text start="119.03" dur="6.24">economy comes down all they need to do</text>
  <text start="121.55" dur="6.15">is raise rates and tighten and if they</text>
  <text start="125.27" dur="4.92">lower weights or they keep rates steady</text>
  <text start="127.7" dur="5.69">and they stop the tightening guess what</text>
  <text start="130.19" dur="5.49">happens the economy stays the way it is</text>
  <text start="133.39" dur="5.08">that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="135.68" dur="4.559">economy behind the scenes is staying the</text>
  <text start="138.47" dur="4.59">way it is it means the statistical</text>
  <text start="140.239" dur="6.351">numbers look ok the manipulated numbers</text>
  <text start="143.06" dur="6.72">look okay the stock market looks ok and</text>
  <text start="146.59" dur="5.229">we&amp;#39;ll be discussing what just happened</text>
  <text start="149.78" dur="4.62">and the mainstream media and what</text>
  <text start="151.819" dur="4.471">they&amp;#39;re reporting now but first let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="154.4" dur="3.839">look at some of the people&amp;#39;s economy</text>
  <text start="156.29" dur="4.529">here and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that</text>
  <text start="158.239" dur="5.161">things are rapidly falling apart in the</text>
  <text start="160.819" dur="3.391">United States even though the GDP</text>
  <text start="163.4" dur="2.52">numbers the an apply</text>
  <text start="164.21" dur="4.5">members of the stock market all that</text>
  <text start="165.92" dur="5.31">looks great from the Fed just raising</text>
  <text start="168.71" dur="3.78">the rates a couple basis points we see</text>
  <text start="171.23" dur="3.54">there are problems in the economy</text>
  <text start="172.49" dur="5.16">remember this is based on an illusion</text>
  <text start="174.77" dur="5.64">this economy that we are in is in an</text>
  <text start="177.65" dur="5.79">illusion and when you look at the</text>
  <text start="180.41" dur="6.06">housing market this is a excellent</text>
  <text start="183.44" dur="7.83">indicator on what is really happening</text>
  <text start="186.47" dur="7.02">here now home price growth it is slowing</text>
  <text start="191.27" dur="4.56">right now remember the central banks</text>
  <text start="193.49" dur="3.99">they pumped the housing bubbles up this</text>
  <text start="195.83" dur="4.71">is what they do they pump bubbles up and</text>
  <text start="197.48" dur="5.79">then they pop them and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="200.54" dur="5.55">growth rate is now starting to slow and</text>
  <text start="203.27" dur="5.67">this is the weakest since September 2012</text>
  <text start="206.09" dur="6.18">we also see using how US housing starts</text>
  <text start="208.94" dur="5.73">they crashed in December they crashed by</text>
  <text start="212.27" dur="4.92">11.2% month a month in December now</text>
  <text start="214.67" dur="5.28">remember it&amp;#39;s going to take a little bit</text>
  <text start="217.19" dur="5.55">of time for the housing market to settle</text>
  <text start="219.95" dur="4.53">down here because the Fed was raising</text>
  <text start="222.74" dur="4.02">interest rates raising interest rates</text>
  <text start="224.48" dur="5.94">and all of a sudden they&amp;#39;re in a holding</text>
  <text start="226.76" dur="6.45">pattern so we&amp;#39;re getting data from back</text>
  <text start="230.42" dur="6.69">in December and what we can see from</text>
  <text start="233.21" dur="7.43">this is that as the Fed raised rates the</text>
  <text start="237.11" dur="7.38">housing market started to fall apart</text>
  <text start="240.64" dur="7.03">housing starts they tumbled by ten point</text>
  <text start="244.49" dur="5.97">nine percent year-on-year this is the</text>
  <text start="247.67" dur="5.85">biggest drop since 2011 but we need to</text>
  <text start="250.46" dur="6.24">remember something very important the</text>
  <text start="253.52" dur="7.05">Fed is now in a holding pattern this is</text>
  <text start="256.7" dur="6.78">data from December while the Fed was</text>
  <text start="260.57" dur="6.24">raising rates it doesn&amp;#39;t happen in a</text>
  <text start="263.48" dur="5.04">split second it takes time so since the</text>
  <text start="266.81" dur="3.03">Fed is in a holding pattern we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="268.52" dur="3.87">to see if they lower the interest rates</text>
  <text start="269.84" dur="6">the housing market will start to</text>
  <text start="272.39" dur="6.81">stabilize a little bit but we can see</text>
  <text start="275.84" dur="6.03">from what the Fed has been doing that</text>
  <text start="279.2" dur="6.42">the housing market is hurting because</text>
  <text start="281.87" dur="5.49">Home Depot it looks like their sales are</text>
  <text start="285.62" dur="4.43">cooling along with the real estate</text>
  <text start="287.36" dur="6.72">market so with the Fed raising rates</text>
  <text start="290.05" dur="5.83">during the year of 2018 it really hurt</text>
  <text start="294.08" dur="3.57">the people&amp;#39;s economy and this was being</text>
  <text start="295.88" dur="4.259">done on purpose</text>
  <text start="297.65" dur="5.1">because they built an illusion and the</text>
  <text start="300.139" dur="5.161">deep state the central bankers they are</text>
  <text start="302.75" dur="4.889">planning to bring the illusion down they</text>
  <text start="305.3" dur="5.76">have full control but who controls the</text>
  <text start="307.639" dur="6.84">Fed now who controls the magic one it is</text>
  <text start="311.06" dur="7.71">Trump and remember back in post 2575</text>
  <text start="314.479" dur="6.961">this is bet back in December 10th 2018 q</text>
  <text start="318.77" dur="5.25">said the following the plan to have the</text>
  <text start="321.44" dur="5.19">Fed raised rates steep incline beginning</text>
  <text start="324.02" dur="5.13">March 2019 in an effort to kill the</text>
  <text start="326.63" dur="5.94">economy prior to the 2020 election is</text>
  <text start="329.15" dur="6.78">known and planned for structure change</text>
  <text start="332.57" dur="6.03">coming now let&amp;#39;s go back to September</text>
  <text start="335.93" dur="4.92">13th 2018 this is from Bloomberg and it</text>
  <text start="338.6" dur="6.51">says warnings keep coming about a</text>
  <text start="340.85" dur="5.939">downturn that will hit in 2020 so back</text>
  <text start="345.11" dur="4.86">then and it was just not Bloomberg it</text>
  <text start="346.789" dur="4.951">was CNBC NBC CNN all the mainstream</text>
  <text start="349.97" dur="4.229">media outlets they were all out there</text>
  <text start="351.74" dur="5.76">telling us that in 2020 we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="354.199" dur="6.061">see a downturn in the economy a</text>
  <text start="357.5" dur="5.31">recession now they even told us it was</text>
  <text start="360.26" dur="4.8">going to be in the later half of that</text>
  <text start="362.81" dur="4.32">year because they were planning it right</text>
  <text start="365.06" dur="3.39">at the point where the elections were</text>
  <text start="367.13" dur="2.969">going to happen maybe a month or two</text>
  <text start="368.45" dur="4.07">right before I would say a month</text>
  <text start="370.099" dur="6.871">probably in October</text>
  <text start="372.52" dur="6.42">fast forward to October 1st 2018 it says</text>
  <text start="376.97" dur="4.41">and this is coming from Bloomberg also</text>
  <text start="378.94" dur="5.14">2/3 of a US business economists see</text>
  <text start="381.38" dur="5.52">recession by end of 2020 and they</text>
  <text start="384.08" dur="5.91">continue with this narrative because</text>
  <text start="386.9" dur="4.829">they believed they thought and they</text>
  <text start="389.99" dur="4.17">thought they had control and they</text>
  <text start="391.729" dur="4.291">thought that the entire system was</text>
  <text start="394.16" dur="3.689">planned to come down in 2020 because</text>
  <text start="396.02" dur="3.36">this was their plan they tried</text>
  <text start="397.849" dur="5.551">everything else to get Trump out of</text>
  <text start="399.38" dur="7.68">office and their last Hail Mary was to</text>
  <text start="403.4" dur="5.85">destroy the economy that he created to</text>
  <text start="407.06" dur="4.44">make it look the economy that he made</text>
  <text start="409.25" dur="5.01">look fantastic so they thought listen if</text>
  <text start="411.5" dur="5.91">we can destroy this people will shy away</text>
  <text start="414.26" dur="7.14">from him but remember what Q said in</text>
  <text start="417.41" dur="6.33">post 2575 the plan to have the Fed</text>
  <text start="421.4" dur="6.06">raised rates steep incline beginning</text>
  <text start="423.74" dur="4.48">March 2019 were moving into March now</text>
  <text start="427.46" dur="4.72">were in</text>
  <text start="428.22" dur="6.05">February and Q told us that they know</text>
  <text start="432.18" dur="6.92">this plan and they&amp;#39;re taking care of it</text>
  <text start="434.27" dur="9.16">look at today&amp;#39;s article from Bloomberg</text>
  <text start="439.1" dur="10.74">the Fed has done much to delay the next</text>
  <text start="443.43" dur="11.58">recession now look what just happened</text>
  <text start="449.84" dur="9.69">Trump controls the Fed how do we know</text>
  <text start="455.01" dur="6.75">this well Q told us that they understood</text>
  <text start="459.53" dur="5.53">that they were going to bring down the</text>
  <text start="461.76" dur="6.48">economy in 2020 by raising the rates in</text>
  <text start="465.06" dur="6.21">2019 like we&amp;#39;ve never seen before then</text>
  <text start="468.24" dur="4.44">all of a sudden the Fed decided they</text>
  <text start="471.27" dur="5.46">were going to go into a holding pattern</text>
  <text start="472.68" dur="7.11">and the Fed is also standing ready to</text>
  <text start="476.73" dur="5.76">cut rates if needed so if the holding</text>
  <text start="479.79" dur="7.05">pattern isn&amp;#39;t enough to stop the</text>
  <text start="482.49" dur="8.61">recession they&amp;#39;re instructed to bring</text>
  <text start="486.84" dur="6.6">the rates down cut them and this will</text>
  <text start="491.1" dur="6.14">boost the markets it will boost the</text>
  <text start="493.44" dur="8.4">economy because we know the central bank</text>
  <text start="497.24" dur="7.179">controls all of it it&amp;#39;s not an open and</text>
  <text start="501.84" dur="5.04">free market Trump is controlling all of</text>
  <text start="504.419" dur="5.461">it with the magic wand he has full</text>
  <text start="506.88" dur="5.25">control again how do we know this well</text>
  <text start="509.88" dur="5.58">we understand that there&amp;#39;s good players</text>
  <text start="512.13" dur="6.93">and bad players in the Fed the good</text>
  <text start="515.46" dur="5.43">players are working with Trump trying to</text>
  <text start="519.06" dur="5.55">bring down the Federal Reserve System</text>
  <text start="520.89" dur="6.5">the bad players the deep state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="524.61" dur="5.64">trying to keep their system operational</text>
  <text start="527.39" dur="5.76">so all of a sudden we have former</text>
  <text start="530.25" dur="6.42">Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen</text>
  <text start="533.15" dur="5.38">saying that Trump lacks a basic</text>
  <text start="536.67" dur="4.59">understanding of the role and goals of</text>
  <text start="538.53" dur="6.63">the Federal Reserve and how the Fed</text>
  <text start="541.26" dur="7.079">helps the economy well let&amp;#39;s go back to</text>
  <text start="545.16" dur="6.06">Trump&amp;#39;s tweet this is December 24th 2018</text>
  <text start="548.339" dur="5.461">and he said the only problem our economy</text>
  <text start="551.22" dur="4.32">has is the Fed they don&amp;#39;t have a feel</text>
  <text start="553.8" dur="3.81">for the market they don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="555.54" dur="4.5">necessary trade wars or strong dollars</text>
  <text start="557.61" dur="4.26">or even Democrat shutdowns over borders</text>
  <text start="560.04" dur="4.71">the Fed is like a</text>
  <text start="561.87" dur="3.75">full golfer who can&amp;#39;t score because he</text>
  <text start="564.75" dur="5.91">has no touch</text>
  <text start="565.62" dur="8.67">he can&amp;#39;t putt Trump understands what the</text>
  <text start="570.66" dur="5.67">Fed is he understands that the Fed is no</text>
  <text start="574.29" dur="4.049">good for this country this is why q was</text>
  <text start="576.33" dur="4.47">out there saying that gold is going to</text>
  <text start="578.339" dur="5.101">be bringing down the Fed so Yellen was</text>
  <text start="580.8" dur="7.59">asked if she believes Trump has a grasp</text>
  <text start="583.44" dur="7.52">of economic policy and she directly</text>
  <text start="588.39" dur="5.01">answered no I do not</text>
  <text start="590.96" dur="4.72">Yellen went further to say that Trump</text>
  <text start="593.4" dur="4.92">had hoped the Fed would base its</text>
  <text start="595.68" dur="4.92">exchange rate moves on Trump&amp;#39;s trade</text>
  <text start="598.32" dur="6.03">plans and his eagerness to address the</text>
  <text start="600.6" dur="4.77">US trade imbalance these hopes came in</text>
  <text start="604.35" dur="2.7">spite of the fact that the Federal</text>
  <text start="605.37" dur="4.29">Reserve traditionally acts independently</text>
  <text start="607.05" dur="4.26">and without interference from the</text>
  <text start="609.66" dur="5.429">executive branch even though the</text>
  <text start="611.31" dur="7.32">President appoints its chairperson Trump</text>
  <text start="615.089" dur="5.19">is not allowing the Fed to act</text>
  <text start="618.63" dur="5.34">independently it is a private</text>
  <text start="620.279" dur="8.011">corporation the Fed will be acting the</text>
  <text start="623.97" dur="5.73">way Trump wants it to act the Fed will</text>
  <text start="628.29" dur="5.19">be taking down</text>
  <text start="629.7" dur="6.24">now why is Yellen out there talking</text>
  <text start="633.48" dur="4.74">about Trump talking about not</text>
  <text start="635.94" dur="4.56">understanding the Fed because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="638.22" dur="5.67">projecting because they understand</text>
  <text start="640.5" dur="6.839">they&amp;#39;re taking down the Fed remember</text>

  <text start="864.08" dur="3.87">he&amp;#39;s going to do he&amp;#39;s been talking about</text>
  <text start="866.24" dur="3.09">the Fed for a very long time if you go</text>

  <text start="869.33" dur="5.64">talking about gold for a very long time</text>
  <text start="871.16" dur="6.39">and you can see that they&amp;#39;re at the</text>
  <text start="874.97" dur="4.14">beginning stages of trying to wake</text>
  <text start="877.55" dur="3.87">people up and you were gonna see a lot</text>
  <text start="879.11" dur="5.21">more of this as we move forward actually</text>

  <text start="892.16" dur="7.34">we do and the first change is to stop</text>
  <text start="895.79" dur="7.53">borrowing from the Fed how do we do that</text>
  <text start="899.5" dur="7.17">we create our own currency and you can</text>
