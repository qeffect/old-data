  <text start="1405.63" dur="7.02">they don&amp;#39;t want to cover that stuff now</text>
  <text start="1408.6" dur="6.54">the house they are trying to stop Trump</text>
  <text start="1412.65" dur="4.59">from building the wall they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1415.14" dur="4.11">everything they possibly can the House</text>
  <text start="1417.24" dur="4.47">passed a joint resolution that would</text>
  <text start="1419.25" dur="5.19">overturn Trump&amp;#39;s emergency declaration</text>
  <text start="1421.71" dur="4.32">at the southern border which was which</text>

  <text start="1426.03" dur="6.39">government spending to his wall now the</text>
  <text start="1428.49" dur="6.93">vote was 236 to 174 and it drew support</text>
  <text start="1432.42" dur="6.6">from eleven Republicans but it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1435.42" dur="6.6">enough to overturn an expected veto from</text>

  <text start="1454.89" dur="5.07">see they&amp;#39;re throwing this at him at</text>
  <text start="1457.68" dur="4.44">every turn Trump tweeted out the</text>

  <text start="1472.95" dur="5.64">doing a great job and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1475.38" dur="6.99">interesting is that Pew Research they</text>
  <text start="1478.59" dur="6.42">put new stats out on the prosecution</text>
  <text start="1482.37" dur="5.31">rate of illegals and what they said is</text>

  <text start="1488.13" dur="3.93">justise records Pew Research Center</text>
  <text start="1490.53" dur="4.35">revealed that the Trump administration</text>

  <text start="1527.28" dur="6.27">he said he was going to do and as time</text>
  <text start="1531.15" dur="4.86">goes on he&amp;#39;s doing more and more as he</text>
  <text start="1533.55" dur="5.57">drains the swamp and removes the blocks</text>
  <text start="1536.01" dur="6.62">it allows him to do more and more</text>
  <text start="1539.12" dur="7.45">because there&amp;#39;s no one stopping him now</text>
  <text start="1542.63" dur="9.31">very interestingly the house they went</text>
  <text start="1546.57" dur="9.54">to work on a health care bill now this</text>
  <text start="1551.94" dur="7.53">was not for the American people this</text>
  <text start="1556.11" dur="7.1">bill was for the illegal immigrants</text>
  <text start="1559.47" dur="6.96">coming in and representative mark Greene</text>
  <text start="1563.21" dur="6.31">he had this writer that he wanted to put</text>
  <text start="1566.43" dur="5.91">on there where it would help veterans to</text>
  <text start="1569.52" dur="5.49">get the same exact care as the illegals</text>
  <text start="1572.34" dur="4.47">and this is what he said last week five</text>
  <text start="1575.01" dur="4.44">of the seven voted against my motion to</text>
  <text start="1576.81" dur="4.83">recommit a simple amendment that would</text>
  <text start="1579.45" dur="3.84">ensure illegal aliens don&amp;#39;t get our</text>

  <text start="1583.29" dur="4.83">veterans HR 35:25 the bill they all</text>
  <text start="1586.5" dur="3.18">voted for would require the Department</text>
  <text start="1588.12" dur="3.87">of Homeland Security to set up an</text>
  <text start="1589.68" dur="4.83">electronic health records system for</text>
  <text start="1591.99" dur="4.35">illegal aliens the Department of Defense</text>

  <text start="1596.34" dur="4.86">have the same technology yet and won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1598.89" dur="5.22">for several more years he says let me</text>
  <text start="1601.2" dur="4.77">repeat this these Democrats voted for</text>
  <text start="1604.11" dur="4.56">health care technology to be delivered</text>
  <text start="1605.97" dur="4.92">to illegal aliens within the next 90</text>
  <text start="1608.67" dur="4.97">days but our veterans and service</text>
  <text start="1610.89" dur="5.73">members won&amp;#39;t get those benefits for</text>
  <text start="1613.64" dur="5.53">years think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="1616.62" dur="3.44">those individuals that fought for this</text>
  <text start="1619.17" dur="2">country</text>
  <text start="1620.06" dur="5.07">the</text>
  <text start="1621.17" dur="6.12">keep this country free they don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="1625.13" dur="6.12">the same care of those individuals</text>
  <text start="1627.29" dur="8.4">coming over the border illegally this is</text>
  <text start="1631.25" dur="9.42">disgusting this should have never ever</text>
  <text start="1635.69" dur="7.02">have happened how is this they benefit</text>
  <text start="1640.67" dur="5.52">to the everyday person living in the</text>
  <text start="1642.71" dur="6.74">u.s. it isn&amp;#39;t and guess what</text>
  <text start="1646.19" dur="6.92">once again they just exposed themselves</text>
  <text start="1649.45" dur="5.86">now North Korea they&amp;#39;re working on</text>
  <text start="1653.11" dur="5.02">additional talks they&amp;#39;re gonna have this</text>
  <text start="1655.31" dur="5.54">in Sweden and these are gonna be working</text>
  <text start="1658.13" dur="4.89">level talks and we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="1660.85" dur="5.68">something come out of this why because</text>
  <text start="1663.02" dur="5.96">Bolton&amp;#39;s gone he was holding everything</text>
  <text start="1666.53" dur="5.04">up I know Trump had to put him out there</text>
  <text start="1668.98" dur="4.78">and he put him out there to keep the</text>
  <text start="1671.57" dur="5.01">press very busy but it was also hurting</text>
  <text start="1673.76" dur="4.2">the peace talks in North Korea now of</text>
  <text start="1676.58" dur="4.17">course there was a trade off and Trump</text>
  <text start="1677.96" dur="4.17">knew this we all knew this and he had to</text>
  <text start="1680.75" dur="3.36">ride this out this is why he wrote</text>
  <text start="1682.13" dur="4.44">letters back and forth to Kim jong-eun</text>
  <text start="1684.11" dur="5.22">to make sure that he stuck by him and</text>
  <text start="1686.57" dur="4.56">look he stuck by him and guess what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1689.33" dur="4.56">gonna happen next we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="1691.13" dur="5.04">something amazing happening now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1693.89" dur="5.94">very interesting it seems like Iran&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1696.17" dur="4.98">rohini is working with Makran and it</text>
  <text start="1699.83" dur="4.56">looks like they&amp;#39;re trying to set up</text>
  <text start="1701.15" dur="5.34">talks between Rohini and Trump now of</text>
  <text start="1704.39" dur="3.75">course Rohini is out there saying listen</text>
  <text start="1706.49" dur="4.08">I agree to everything McCrone is saying</text>
  <text start="1708.14" dur="4.35">but the United States needs to drop the</text>
  <text start="1710.57" dur="3.84">sanctions that we know Trump he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1712.49" dur="4.11">just gonna drop the sanctions he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="1714.41" dur="5.33">want certain things from Iran but I</text>
  <text start="1716.6" dur="5.82">noticed Iran is continually reaching out</text>
  <text start="1719.74" dur="4.69">to trump maybe he&amp;#39;s going through macron</text>
  <text start="1722.42" dur="6.21">and we know that Trump and macron they</text>
  <text start="1724.43" dur="7.26">met at I believe it was the g7 meeting</text>
  <text start="1728.63" dur="5.91">they talked about Iran there he also met</text>
  <text start="1731.69" dur="5.37">at the UN so it might be that something</text>
  <text start="1734.54" dur="4.29">is in play right now where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1737.06" dur="2.88">trying to get together and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1738.83" dur="3.36">trying to make this deal now I do</text>
  <text start="1739.94" dur="4.89">believe that certain deals have already</text>
  <text start="1742.19" dur="6.81">been made in the backroom and this is</text>
  <text start="1744.83" dur="6.96">all show that this is now being</text>
  <text start="1749" dur="6.09">presented to the American people and it</text>
  <text start="1751.79" dur="8.639">looks like Makran might be working we</text>
  <text start="1755.09" dur="7.439">rohini on this to move forward with what</text>
  <text start="1760.429" dur="3.75">is going to happen here now we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="1762.529" dur="4.5">to wait and see how this all plays out</text>
  <text start="1764.179" dur="5.61">but again we know that trump is waiting</text>
