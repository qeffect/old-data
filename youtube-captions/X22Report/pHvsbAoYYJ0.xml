  <text start="57.02" dur="5.76">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.61" dur="7.62">episode 1335 a and today&amp;#39;s date is July</text>
  <text start="62.78" dur="6.18">18th 2017 and top of the episode is the</text>
  <text start="66.23" dur="5.34">central banks banks are preparing for</text>
  <text start="68.96" dur="4.58">the economic transition let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="71.57" dur="5.97">the economic collapse financial news</text>
  <text start="73.54" dur="6.52">central banks banks well they understand</text>
  <text start="77.54" dur="4.26">that this economy was never meant to</text>
  <text start="80.06" dur="4.89">last I mean it should have collapsed in</text>
  <text start="81.8" dur="6.3">2008 and they created this illusion to</text>
  <text start="84.95" dur="5.73">prepare for when this entire system</text>
  <text start="88.1" dur="4.44">comes down and they&amp;#39;ve been preparing</text>
  <text start="90.68" dur="4.47">for the last couple of years but they</text>
  <text start="92.54" dur="5.43">knew eventually this system would go</text>
  <text start="95.15" dur="5.19">through a transition from the old system</text>
  <text start="97.97" dur="4.56">the old paper dollar the old reserve</text>
  <text start="100.34" dur="4.25">currency that the world is using right</text>
  <text start="102.53" dur="5.699">now to something completely different</text>
  <text start="104.59" dur="6.639">now this can be many different types of</text>
  <text start="108.229" dur="4.771">currencies there can be a currency that</text>
  <text start="111.229" dur="4.051">sits on top where governments and</text>
  <text start="113" dur="4.38">corporations they use this currency to</text>
  <text start="115.28" dur="5.19">trade it could be gold back it could be</text>
  <text start="117.38" dur="6.65">silver back then there might be local</text>
  <text start="120.47" dur="7.08">currencies that the everyday person uses</text>
  <text start="124.03" dur="7.06">now again we might not even have a</text>
  <text start="127.55" dur="6.36">reserve currency maybe on the top level</text>
  <text start="131.09" dur="5.13">it won&amp;#39;t be a reserve currency of one</text>
  <text start="133.91" dur="5.01">particular nation it might be something</text>
  <text start="136.22" dur="6">that all countries decided to use and</text>
  <text start="138.92" dur="6.09">it&amp;#39;s backed by something tangible on the</text>
  <text start="142.22" dur="6">local level well we understand that it</text>
  <text start="145.01" dur="5.4">might be digital again the central banks</text>
  <text start="148.22" dur="5.19">there&amp;#39;s many things happening all at</text>
  <text start="150.41" dur="5.43">once here the central banks they want to</text>
  <text start="153.41" dur="4.86">control the currency they always have</text>
  <text start="155.84" dur="4.29">they always will and it doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="158.27" dur="4.35">if it&amp;#39;s paper it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="160.13" dur="4.95">digital as long as they have controlled</text>
  <text start="162.62" dur="4.47">is its centralized even though</text>
  <text start="165.08" dur="4.86">everyone&amp;#39;s talking about the blockchain</text>
  <text start="167.09" dur="5.79">technology bitcoin litecoin all the</text>
  <text start="169.94" dur="6.87">different coins we need to understand</text>
  <text start="172.88" dur="6.93">there still can be control of this</text>
  <text start="176.81" dur="4.14">technology because what we see is</text>
  <text start="179.81" dur="5.55">there&amp;#39;s corporations that are being</text>
  <text start="180.95" dur="5.61">formed where they use this technology</text>
  <text start="185.36" dur="4.29">they</text>
  <text start="186.56" dur="5.88">develop this technology they control</text>
  <text start="189.65" dur="5.16">this technology same thing with the</text>
  <text start="192.44" dur="5.43">central banks what they want to do is</text>
  <text start="194.81" dur="6.69">they want to develop and control and</text>
  <text start="197.87" dur="8.1">have everyone use this digital system</text>
  <text start="201.5" dur="6.33">and it won&amp;#39;t be a truth type of system</text>
  <text start="205.97" dur="4.86">because they still will be able to</text>
  <text start="207.83" dur="5.129">manipulate it remember just because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="210.83" dur="4.14">a blockchain type of technology it</text>
  <text start="212.959" dur="5.31">doesn&amp;#39;t mean those who are in control</text>
  <text start="214.97" dur="5.88">those who are fiddling with it writing</text>
  <text start="218.269" dur="7.141">the code well they still have the</text>
  <text start="220.85" dur="7.05">ability to manipulate it in their way so</text>
  <text start="225.41" dur="5.1">when we look at this we want this to be</text>
  <text start="227.9" dur="6.119">completely decentralized we don&amp;#39;t want a</text>
  <text start="230.51" dur="6.93">central point where they&amp;#39;re controlling</text>
  <text start="234.019" dur="6.69">all of this and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="237.44" dur="5.96">that central bank&amp;#39;s banks they are</text>
  <text start="240.709" dur="5.431">getting ready for this transition and</text>
  <text start="243.4" dur="4.919">they want to be in control going to be</text>
  <text start="246.14" dur="6.18">talking about this in a little bit now</text>
  <text start="248.319" dur="6.401">what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is the economy</text>
  <text start="252.32" dur="4.83">well its continually deteriorating it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="254.72" dur="5.31">not improving and we&amp;#39;re already starting</text>
  <text start="257.15" dur="6.15">to see signs where they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="260.03" dur="5.46">blame this on Trump now we knew this</text>
  <text start="263.3" dur="4.58">eventually was going to happen we have</text>
  <text start="265.49" dur="4.739">the National Association of Homebuilders</text>
  <text start="267.88" dur="5.98">they are out there and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="270.229" dur="7.021">that well we have a problem with new</text>
  <text start="273.86" dur="6.15">homes and the confidence is dropping</text>
  <text start="277.25" dur="5.639">amongst home builders and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="280.01" dur="5.37">blaming this on Trump why because of the</text>
  <text start="282.889" dur="4.171">Canadian lumber Kerris that he imposed</text>
  <text start="285.38" dur="5.24">me they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s become</text>
  <text start="287.06" dur="5.94">unaffordable to build these homes and</text>
  <text start="290.62" dur="4.419">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="293" dur="6.72">single-family sales they have fallen</text>
  <text start="295.039" dur="8.401">from 72 to 74 single-family homes have</text>
  <text start="299.72" dur="6.09">fallen from 75 to 73 we see that</text>
  <text start="303.44" dur="6.18">prospective buyers traffic has fallen</text>
  <text start="305.81" dur="5.7">from 49 to 48 and they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="309.62" dur="5.13">saying listen because of what Trump is</text>
  <text start="311.51" dur="5.55">doing his policies and he really does</text>
  <text start="314.75" dur="5.4">not have that many policies in place</text>
  <text start="317.06" dur="6.06">right now yes he has this one</text>
  <text start="320.15" dur="5.25">Arif but when you look closely added and</text>
  <text start="323.12" dur="4.32">this is again coming from the National</text>
  <text start="325.4" dur="5.27">Association of Homebuilders chairman</text>
  <text start="327.44" dur="5.85">Granger McDonald he&amp;#39;s saying that our</text>
  <text start="330.67" dur="4.57">members are telling us they are growing</text>
  <text start="333.29" dur="5.49">increasingly concerned over rising</text>
  <text start="335.24" dur="6.06">material prices particularly lumber this</text>
  <text start="338.78" dur="4.74">is hurting housing affordability even as</text>
  <text start="341.3" dur="6.77">consumer interest in the new home market</text>
  <text start="343.52" dur="9.42">remains very very strong now again</text>
  <text start="348.07" dur="7.93">looking at the lumber prices when you</text>
  <text start="352.94" dur="6.57">look at them they are still below the</text>
  <text start="356" dur="6.87">April 25th levels when Trump invoked the</text>
  <text start="359.51" dur="6.21">tariff so when they talk about raising</text>
  <text start="362.87" dur="7.11">costs and the problem with lumber it</text>
  <text start="365.72" dur="6.99">really doesn&amp;#39;t exist what they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="369.98" dur="2.91">seeing is that the system is breaking</text>
  <text start="372.71" dur="4.05">down</text>
  <text start="372.89" dur="7.32">I remember going back in time to three</text>
  <text start="376.76" dur="5.22">years ago when the corporate media when</text>
  <text start="380.21" dur="4.5">everyone was out there saying that oh</text>
  <text start="381.98" dur="4.74">the retail sales they&amp;#39;re not doing well</text>
  <text start="384.71" dur="4.38">because it snowed on this day and</text>
  <text start="386.72" dur="4.35">remember it only snowed in one portion</text>
  <text start="389.09" dur="4.14">of the country the rest you know the</text>
  <text start="391.07" dur="4.59">ninety eight percent of the country they</text>
  <text start="393.23" dur="4.62">were fine but it snowed up in the you</text>
  <text start="395.66" dur="3.78">know maybe the North East and people</text>
  <text start="397.85" dur="5.21">went oh that&amp;#39;s why people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="399.44" dur="5.76">shopping they blamed it on the weather</text>
  <text start="403.06" dur="3.7">then they started to blame it online</text>
  <text start="405.2" dur="5.01">because they&amp;#39;re running out of excuses</text>
  <text start="406.76" dur="5.37">now they&amp;#39;re blaming it on well we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="410.21" dur="3.63">know because they&amp;#39;re using the whether</text>
  <text start="412.13" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re using online they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="413.84" dur="3.93">anything they possibly can to make sure</text>
  <text start="416.24" dur="3.69">that people don&amp;#39;t understand what is</text>
  <text start="417.77" dur="3.3">going on and back then we said no this</text>
  <text start="419.93" dur="2.76">problem is going to get worse has</text>
  <text start="421.07" dur="3.78">nothing to do the weather has nothing to</text>
  <text start="422.69" dur="4.71">do with online it has to do with people</text>
  <text start="424.85" dur="5.1">not having the funds to go out and to</text>
  <text start="427.4" dur="5.25">purchase these goods the same thing now</text>
  <text start="429.95" dur="5.46">is happening in the real estate market</text>
  <text start="432.65" dur="5.4">in the new construction market they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="435.41" dur="5.46">going to be pointing fingers at things</text>
  <text start="438.05" dur="5.61">that don&amp;#39;t exist because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="440.87" dur="5.4">to admit that this economy is fake phony</text>
  <text start="443.66" dur="4.68">and false and it&amp;#39;s completely built on</text>
  <text start="446.27" dur="4.74">an illusion and what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="448.34" dur="3.6">is that these lumber prices where</text>
  <text start="451.01" dur="2.37">they&amp;#39;re going to be complaining about</text>
  <text start="451.94" dur="3.84">the prices they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="453.38" dur="4.26">really not going to move just like we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="455.78" dur="4.71">seen since April 25th they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="457.64" dur="4.41">really moved anywhere and what is going</text>
  <text start="460.49" dur="3.84">to happen is the real estate market is</text>
  <text start="462.05" dur="6.21">going to continually and continually and</text>
  <text start="464.33" dur="5.46">continually decline and again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="468.26" dur="3.24">going to run out of excuses they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="469.79" dur="4.2">use the weather right now because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="471.5" dur="4.5">sunny so they have to resort to</text>
  <text start="473.99" dur="5.31">something else now if you take this a</text>
  <text start="476" dur="6.87">step further we know that investment</text>
  <text start="479.3" dur="6.03">companies hedge funds foreign entities</text>
  <text start="482.87" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;ve been in they&amp;#39;ve been purchasing</text>
  <text start="485.33" dur="5.28">homes they&amp;#39;ve been purchasing commercial</text>
  <text start="488.54" dur="4.29">real estate and they&amp;#39;ve been propping up</text>
  <text start="490.61" dur="3.51">this market meanwhile the everyday</text>
  <text start="492.83" dur="5.73">American has-been is sitting on the</text>
  <text start="494.12" dur="6.47">sidelines the next generation well they</text>
  <text start="498.56" dur="5.52">can&amp;#39;t get out of their parents homes</text>
  <text start="500.59" dur="5.44">they can&amp;#39;t find jobs where they make</text>
  <text start="504.08" dur="3.96">enough to purchase a home and those</text>
  <text start="506.03" dur="6.33">people who are lucky enough to purchase</text>
  <text start="508.04" dur="6.96">a home with no money down well or with a</text>
  <text start="512.36" dur="6.359">variable interest rate they might be in</text>
  <text start="515" dur="6.69">trouble moving forward now when we look</text>
  <text start="518.719" dur="5.851">at commercial real estate we see there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="521.69" dur="4.5">a problem once again has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="524.57" dur="4.71">with the weather has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="526.19" dur="7.26">the materials it has to do with foreign</text>
  <text start="529.28" dur="6.81">investors mainly Chinese entities</text>
  <text start="533.45" dur="4.5">because they accounted for half of the</text>
  <text start="536.09" dur="4.53">commercial real estate purchases with</text>
  <text start="537.95" dur="6.15">prices over ten million and when we go</text>
  <text start="540.62" dur="4.92">back in time we see that this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.1" dur="4.26">been happening to me go back to 2011</text>
  <text start="545.54" dur="5.13">through 2014 the total cross broader</text>
  <text start="548.36" dur="4.32">purchases from all over the world not</text>
  <text start="550.67" dur="4.62">just from China were in the mid 20</text>
  <text start="552.68" dur="5.34">percent range at a time when domestic</text>
  <text start="555.29" dur="6.21">investors pulled back foreign parties</text>
  <text start="558.02" dur="6.81">jumped in at the end of the first half</text>
  <text start="561.5" dur="5.88">of 2017 the annual forecast of total</text>
  <text start="564.83" dur="7.05">transaction volume was on pace to be 40</text>
  <text start="567.38" dur="9.9">percent lower than 2016 and 60 percent</text>
  <text start="571.88" dur="7.32">drop off 2015 at the current pace 2017</text>
  <text start="577.28" dur="5.04">is shaping up to have the lowest cell</text>
  <text start="579.2" dur="6.57">count since the period from 2008 to 2010</text>
  <text start="582.32" dur="4.83">and what is happening right now is these</text>
  <text start="585.77" dur="4.53">foreign</text>
  <text start="587.15" dur="6.03">investors they&amp;#39;re drying up right now if</text>
  <text start="590.3" dur="3.62">you look at Midtown and downtown in New</text>
  <text start="593.18" dur="2.94">York</text>
  <text start="593.92" dur="4.11">leasing volume in the second quarter</text>
  <text start="596.12" dur="4.59">plunged by thirty five percent in</text>
  <text start="598.03" dur="4.87">Midtown the vacancy rate rose to eleven</text>
  <text start="600.71" dur="5.82">percent up from 10.1 percent a year ago</text>
  <text start="602.9" dur="5.94">downtown arose 12.1 percent up from ten</text>
  <text start="606.53" dur="3.9">point four percent a year ago this is</text>
  <text start="608.84" dur="5.97">not just happening in Manhattan it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="610.43" dur="7.32">happening in many different cities so</text>
  <text start="614.81" dur="4.56">this is an ongoing situation and what</text>
  <text start="617.75" dur="6.74">we&amp;#39;re looking at is something that</text>
  <text start="619.37" dur="8.52">happened back in 2007 going into 2008</text>
  <text start="624.49" dur="6.19">where everything started to decline we</text>
  <text start="627.89" dur="6.75">were pumped up from 2011 all the way to</text>
  <text start="630.68" dur="6.6">2015 then we started a decline from 2015</text>
  <text start="634.64" dur="5.7">onward and it&amp;#39;s accelerating right now</text>
  <text start="637.28" dur="6.75">and we saw the same thing happen back</text>
  <text start="640.34" dur="7.41">prior to the Great Recession of 2008 so</text>
  <text start="644.03" dur="7.92">this fake economy it&amp;#39;s coming to an end</text>
  <text start="647.75" dur="7.44">that&amp;#39;s what all this is telling us now</text>
  <text start="651.95" dur="6.09">US imports and exports them before the</text>
  <text start="655.19" dur="5.4">second month and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="658.04" dur="4.56">that we&amp;#39;re starting to see the same</text>
  <text start="660.59" dur="5.33">exact thing happen once again that</text>
  <text start="662.6" dur="5.46">happened in 2007 2007 going into 2008</text>
  <text start="665.92" dur="4.84">now we&amp;#39;re starting to see that the</text>
  <text start="668.06" dur="6.59">import the import price index from China</text>
  <text start="670.76" dur="10.56">well it&amp;#39;s resumed its downward trend and</text>
  <text start="674.65" dur="10.39">once again if you go back to 2008 into</text>
  <text start="681.32" dur="6.63">2009 we saw the same thing happen once</text>
  <text start="685.04" dur="5.82">again actually right at the end of 2007</text>
  <text start="687.95" dur="4.32">all of a sudden everything just started</text>
  <text start="690.86" dur="4.89">to fall apart we&amp;#39;re following the same</text>
  <text start="692.27" dur="4.98">exact pattern once again so we have</text>
  <text start="695.75" dur="2.73">problems all over the place and all</text>
  <text start="697.25" dur="3.39">these economic indicators that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="698.48" dur="5.52">been looking at they&amp;#39;re following the</text>
  <text start="700.64" dur="7.29">same exact pattern because why this is a</text>
  <text start="704" dur="6.72">bubble pattern and they always follow</text>
  <text start="707.93" dur="5.16">the same course now the timeframe might</text>

  <text start="736.99" dur="5.5">government&amp;#39;s central banks they know</text>
  <text start="739.519" dur="5.581">that this system is on its last leg here</text>
  <text start="742.49" dur="4.17">and they&amp;#39;re preparing for this</text>
  <text start="745.1" dur="4.08">transition this is why Trump is talking</text>

  <text start="763.73" dur="4.979">want globalism but you have to remember</text>
  <text start="766.22" dur="6.57">what&amp;#39;s going to happen when the system</text>
  <text start="768.709" dur="6.451">comes down what happens when the dollar</text>
  <text start="772.79" dur="6.69">is no longer the reserve currency when</text>
  <text start="775.16" dur="6.96">the dollar is devalued trade well it</text>

  <text start="794" dur="4.5">going to be a lot more money it&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="795.529" dur="6.99">cheaper at that point to build it here</text>
  <text start="798.5" dur="6.209">in the US to drill for our own oil to</text>
  <text start="802.519" dur="3.54">establish trade because this is the only</text>

  <text start="806.059" dur="6.27">survive if we don&amp;#39;t have this it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="809.329" dur="6.331">to be very very difficult but banks and</text>
  <text start="812.329" dur="5.61">central banks they&amp;#39;re preparing on the</text>
  <text start="815.66" dur="4.919">currency level because they understand</text>
  <text start="817.939" dur="4.111">that the dollar well it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="820.579" dur="3.51">last it&amp;#39;s not going to be the reserve</text>
  <text start="822.05" dur="4.979">currency of the world we can see already</text>
  <text start="824.089" dur="3.75">that everything is moving from the west</text>
  <text start="827.029" dur="2.91">to the east</text>
  <text start="827.839" dur="3.391">they&amp;#39;re duplicating everything that</text>

  <text start="831.23" dur="3.69">for quite a while it&amp;#39;s not like Oh</text>
  <text start="833.18" dur="4.32">yesterday we woke up and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="834.92" dur="5.339">they have the same type of stock market</text>
  <text start="837.5" dur="4.649">they have the same type of gold exchange</text>
  <text start="840.259" dur="4.591">they have a system that looks just like</text>
  <text start="842.149" dur="5.851">the Swift system that operates like the</text>
  <text start="844.85" dur="4.859">Swift system we could see that countries</text>
  <text start="848" dur="4.83">are selling off their Treasuries they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="849.709" dur="7.891">trading by passing the dollar this</text>
  <text start="852.83" dur="7.47">has been going on since 2011 and onward</text>
  <text start="857.6" dur="5.33">and it&amp;#39;s accelerated to this point now</text>
  <text start="860.3" dur="5.76">we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on all of this and</text>
  <text start="862.93" dur="5.08">what we&amp;#39;ve seen is that yes everything</text>
  <text start="866.06" dur="2.46">that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about well here</text>
  <text start="868.01" dur="3.36">we are</text>
  <text start="868.52" dur="4.32">everything is prepared and ready and now</text>
  <text start="871.37" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;re getting ready to take the next</text>
  <text start="872.84" dur="5.31">step it&amp;#39;s not like oh one day it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="875.63" dur="5.88">to happen no we&amp;#39;re here getting ready to</text>
  <text start="878.15" dur="7.05">take the next step now the game-changer</text>
  <text start="881.51" dur="7.71">is cryptocurrency where this is coming</text>
  <text start="885.2" dur="6.75">into the mainstream here people are</text>
  <text start="889.22" dur="8.28">looking at this it&amp;#39;s an efficient system</text>
  <text start="891.95" dur="8.37">to use currency to basically use it as a</text>
  <text start="897.5" dur="6.69">digital currency because it can be</text>
  <text start="900.32" dur="6.57">decentralized where each system around</text>
  <text start="904.19" dur="4.56">the world has a ledger and each system</text>
  <text start="906.89" dur="4.29">checks with another to make sure that</text>
  <text start="908.75" dur="6.11">yes these transactions are true and each</text>
  <text start="911.18" dur="8.07">ledger keeps every single transaction</text>
  <text start="914.86" dur="7.3">going back throughout time and it checks</text>
  <text start="919.25" dur="4.47">with each and every one of them this is</text>
  <text start="922.16" dur="5.34">what&amp;#39;s this what makes it a truth</text>
  <text start="923.72" dur="6.86">machine now the problem is is if the</text>
  <text start="927.5" dur="6.99">central bank&amp;#39;s control it and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="930.58" dur="6.25">decentralized and that&amp;#39;s what the</text>
  <text start="934.49" dur="5.16">central bank&amp;#39;s want to do yes they would</text>
  <text start="936.83" dur="4.11">like to use the digital technology yes</text>
  <text start="939.65" dur="3.69">they would get they would like to get</text>
  <text start="940.94" dur="4.41">rid of paper but they want to be in</text>
  <text start="943.34" dur="6.41">control of their system we&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="945.35" dur="8.1">Goldman Sachs well they just patented</text>
  <text start="949.75" dur="9.43">their own cryptocurrency settlement</text>
  <text start="953.45" dur="8.52">system called set L coin now the concept</text>
  <text start="959.18" dur="5.19">envisions a system for settling security</text>
  <text start="961.97" dur="6.87">trades using cryptocurrency instead of</text>
  <text start="964.37" dur="8.42">cash or other cash equivalents now they</text>
  <text start="968.84" dur="7.77">were they filed this patent back in 2015</text>
  <text start="972.79" dur="7.03">they already knew what was happening</text>
  <text start="976.61" dur="5.19">they understood and central banks are</text>
  <text start="979.82" dur="3.87">doing the same thing other banking</text>
  <text start="981.8" dur="5.25">systems are doing the same thing because</text>
  <text start="983.69" dur="6">their idea is to maintain</text>
  <text start="987.05" dur="6.51">control of all this to own the patents</text>
  <text start="989.69" dur="5.49">on the systems and this is what we are</text>
  <text start="993.56" dur="5.37">seeing right now because they are</text>
  <text start="995.18" dur="6.48">prepared and ready to go forward with</text>
  <text start="998.93" dur="7.44">digital currency as long as they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="1001.66" dur="8.94">charge now what they&amp;#39;re saying is that</text>
  <text start="1006.37" dur="8.87">this set L coins this is going to</text>
  <text start="1010.6" dur="6.979">digitize stocks now the application this</text>
  <text start="1015.24" dur="4.63">exchanging of set L coins</text>
  <text start="1017.579" dur="5.891">well they&amp;#39;re going to be working with</text>
  <text start="1019.87" dur="4.53">firms like Google Microsoft and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1023.47" dur="3.599">going to be working with crypto</text>
  <text start="1024.4" dur="6.72">currencies like Bitcoin and litecoin in</text>
  <text start="1027.069" dur="7.77">particular so what they&amp;#39;re saying right</text>
  <text start="1031.12" dur="5.91">now is that the settlement times well</text>
  <text start="1034.839" dur="6.081">it&amp;#39;s going to be instantaneous instead</text>
  <text start="1037.03" dur="6.72">of waiting to three business days and</text>
  <text start="1040.92" dur="4.899">according to Goldman set L coin is a</text>
  <text start="1043.75" dur="4.079">cryptocurrency that can be exchanged for</text>
  <text start="1045.819" dur="4.201">financial securities over a peer-to-peer</text>
  <text start="1047.829" dur="5.371">network allowing trades to settle in</text>
  <text start="1050.02" dur="6.84">certainly because transfer of set L coin</text>
  <text start="1053.2" dur="7.35">is instant now now remember they own the</text>
  <text start="1056.86" dur="6.6">patent to this so we can see at this</text>
  <text start="1060.55" dur="4.44">point they are ready and prepared they</text>
  <text start="1063.46" dur="4.14">knew exactly what was happening they</text>
  <text start="1064.99" dur="6.87">knew exactly what this system was going</text>
  <text start="1067.6" dur="8.73">to be and they want full control of the</text>
  <text start="1071.86" dur="7.5">system and the way cryptocurrencies are</text>
  <text start="1076.33" dur="6.39">set up we don&amp;#39;t need these banking</text>
  <text start="1079.36" dur="5.67">systems we don&amp;#39;t need someone to own the</text>
  <text start="1082.72" dur="4.52">patent and to control this stuff we</text>
  <text start="1085.03" dur="5.52">don&amp;#39;t need the Federal Reserve to</text>
  <text start="1087.24" dur="6.28">control everything we need a system</text>
  <text start="1090.55" dur="5.49">where it&amp;#39;s open and can be used and</text>
  <text start="1093.52" dur="6.42">controlled by the people not by a</text>
  <text start="1096.04" dur="7.08">corporation where they still loan the</text>
  <text start="1099.94" dur="5.55">currency to the government&amp;#39;s with</text>
  <text start="1103.12" dur="4.82">interest attached and then that currency</text>
  <text start="1105.49" dur="5.67">then can be used amongst the people</text>
  <text start="1107.94" dur="6.55">using their crypto service this is</text>
  <text start="1111.16" dur="6.42">something we still don&amp;#39;t want and again</text>
  <text start="1114.49" dur="5.189">as we can see there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="1117.58" dur="3.28">battle between the central banking</text>
  <text start="1119.679" dur="3.731">system</text>
  <text start="1120.86" dur="4.58">and the people who want to be separate</text>
  <text start="1123.41" dur="6.03">and apart because if we have a</text>
  <text start="1125.44" dur="6.58">decentralized crypto system as we go</text>
  <text start="1129.44" dur="5.58">through this transition there is really</text>
  <text start="1132.02" dur="6.21">no reason to have the banking systems</text>
  <text start="1135.02" dur="7.71">anymore because your funds are not kept</text>
  <text start="1138.23" dur="9.69">in that banks system anymore your funds</text>
  <text start="1142.73" dur="8.31">are on you or in your wallet or your</text>
  <text start="1147.92" dur="7.17">paper wallet and it can be recreated we</text>
  <text start="1151.04" dur="6">created because the ledgers are spread</text>
  <text start="1155.09" dur="4.89">across the globe and they can be</text>
  <text start="1157.04" dur="4.62">recreated going all the way back to the</text>
  <text start="1159.98" dur="5.73">beginning of the system because it keeps</text>
  <text start="1161.66" dur="6.33">track of every single transaction not</text>
  <text start="1165.71" dur="5.089">the amount but each transaction</text>
  <text start="1167.99" dur="7.2">transaction so it can be recreated at</text>
  <text start="1170.799" dur="6.941">any time so you don&amp;#39;t have to worry</text>
  <text start="1175.19" dur="4.619">about the banking system you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1177.74" dur="4.22">to worry about having your funds in a</text>
  <text start="1179.809" dur="6.721">bank there&amp;#39;d be no reason for it and</text>
  <text start="1181.96" dur="7">once again if we&amp;#39;re trading these</text>
  <text start="1186.53" dur="5.58">currencies outside of the Federal</text>
  <text start="1188.96" dur="7.68">Reserve or outside of the EU outside of</text>
  <text start="1192.11" dur="8.25">the biz the IMF well why do we have to</text>
  <text start="1196.64" dur="6.72">pay taxes because again they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1200.36" dur="6.18">issuing the debt because the federal the</text>
  <text start="1203.36" dur="4.83">Fed Note is is as a piece of paper that</text>
  <text start="1206.54" dur="6.15">is really debt it&amp;#39;s not really a</text>
  <text start="1208.19" dur="7.89">currency so if we trade in it and we use</text>
  <text start="1212.69" dur="6.21">it to purchase there&amp;#39;s no reason to pay</text>
  <text start="1216.08" dur="6">any taxes because the only reason we pay</text>
  <text start="1218.9" dur="6.09">taxes is because we&amp;#39;re borrowing the</text>
  <text start="1222.08" dur="5.7">money from the central bank they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1224.99" dur="5.25">loaning the money with interest so they</text>
  <text start="1227.78" dur="4.139">have to collect the taxes to pay for</text>
  <text start="1230.24" dur="4.17">that I mean that&amp;#39;s how originally</text>
  <text start="1231.919" dur="3.841">started then of course you know the</text>
  <text start="1234.41" dur="2.67">government kept on borrowing and</text>
  <text start="1235.76" dur="3.33">borrowing and borrowing they needed more</text>
  <text start="1237.08" dur="4.11">taxes and the whole thing was a complete</text>
  <text start="1239.09" dur="4.74">disaster but before that there was no</text>
  <text start="1241.19" dur="5.79">reason the only reason we pay taxes is</text>
  <text start="1243.83" dur="6.03">because of the Federal Reserve we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1246.98" dur="5.49">paying back the interest on the loan</text>
  <text start="1249.86" dur="4.62">money if we have a decentralized system</text>
  <text start="1252.47" dur="4.71">and we use it for transactions</text>
  <text start="1254.48" dur="5.22">the money wasn&amp;#39;t loan to us there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1257.18" dur="5.82">reason to have taxes there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="1259.7" dur="6.57">for any event so as we move forward we</text>
  <text start="1263" dur="6.6">need to take back our system and this is</text>
  <text start="1266.27" dur="6.39">the opportunity to take back this system</text>
  <text start="1269.6" dur="4.89">through the transition listen everyone</text>
