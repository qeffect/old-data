  <text start="124.78" dur="4.979">down the central banking system Trump</text>
  <text start="127.18" dur="4.71">has Andrew Jackson hanging on his wall</text>
  <text start="129.759" dur="3.781">we know that cue mention that the Fed</text>
  <text start="131.89" dur="3.569">was going to be brought down by using</text>
  <text start="133.54" dur="5.31">gold the Fed was going to be</text>
  <text start="135.459" dur="4.681">restructured and they were trying and</text>
  <text start="138.85" dur="3.57">I&amp;#39;m talking about they the mainstream</text>
  <text start="140.14" dur="6.06">media was trying to push the narrative</text>
  <text start="142.42" dur="6.39">that Trump his economic policies they</text>
  <text start="146.2" dur="5.58">were going to destroy the economy they</text>

  <text start="151.78" dur="4.5">everything else was not going to work</text>
  <text start="154" dur="5.099">and the economy was going to implode now</text>
  <text start="156.28" dur="5.099">remember Trump has the magic one he has</text>
  <text start="159.099" dur="4.411">full control of the manipulation machine</text>
  <text start="161.379" dur="3.241">that the central bank in the deep state</text>
  <text start="163.51" dur="4.29">were using</text>

  <text start="167.8" dur="5.85">people&amp;#39;s benefit and the mainstream</text>
  <text start="171.43" dur="4.38">media the central bank they got caught</text>
  <text start="173.65" dur="4.919">up in thinking that oh okay we still</text>
  <text start="175.81" dur="4.71">have control and once he puts his tax</text>
  <text start="178.569" dur="4.491">cuts once he starts to do this we&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="180.52" dur="4.74">able to bring down the entire system and</text>
  <text start="183.06" dur="5.52">we&amp;#39;ll show that the economy is</text>
  <text start="185.26" dur="6.15">deteriorating well that didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="188.58" dur="5.23">Trump manipulated the numbers with the</text>
  <text start="191.41" dur="5.49">magic one and made the stock market go</text>
  <text start="193.81" dur="5.67">up made unemployment go down made GDP</text>
  <text start="196.9" dur="4.919">look incredible and the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="199.48" dur="2.91">the central banks they were stopped in</text>
  <text start="201.819" dur="4.491">their tracks</text>
  <text start="202.39" dur="6.75">then Trump decided to use tariffs to</text>
  <text start="206.31" dur="5.05">even the playing field remember the deep</text>
  <text start="209.14" dur="4.349">state the central bank they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="211.36" dur="4.5">setting up this entire economic system</text>
  <text start="213.489" dur="4.351">for a globalist system we know that</text>
  <text start="215.86" dur="3.8">Trump is out there saying listen the</text>
  <text start="217.84" dur="4.22">global system has come to an end and</text>
  <text start="219.66" dur="5.109">they were using the tariffs to say</text>
  <text start="222.06" dur="4.57">growth is going to slow trade is going</text>
  <text start="224.769" dur="2.931">to slow everything is going to be a</text>
  <text start="226.63" dur="4.59">disaster</text>
  <text start="227.7" dur="5.02">now remember Trump was using this to</text>
  <text start="231.22" dur="3.72">even the playing field because we know</text>
  <text start="232.72" dur="4.889">were headed towards this transition we</text>
  <text start="234.94" dur="5.46">know that the manufacturing has to come</text>
  <text start="237.609" dur="4.771">back to the United States he has to look</text>
  <text start="240.4" dur="4.95">at what has been going on with trade and</text>
  <text start="242.38" dur="5.37">everything else and kind of reset it so</text>
  <text start="245.35" dur="6.63">moving forward we&amp;#39;re in a better</text>
  <text start="247.75" dur="6.84">position and they were saying oh these</text>
  <text start="251.98" dur="4.229">tariffs are gonna hurt the holiday</text>
  <text start="254.59" dur="3.269">season they&amp;#39;re gonna hurt this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="256.209" dur="6.841">gonna hurt trade that could hurt growth</text>
  <text start="257.859" dur="8.491">and it turns out that Trump controls</text>
  <text start="263.05" dur="7.71">that narrative because right now he is</text>
  <text start="266.35" dur="7.64">in talks with China in removing the</text>
  <text start="270.76" dur="6.3">tariffs remember they&amp;#39;ve temporarily</text>
  <text start="273.99" dur="4.45">banned the terrace for a certain period</text>
  <text start="277.06" dur="4.44">of time right now I believe it&amp;#39;s 90 days</text>
  <text start="278.44" dur="6">and he will be in discussions meeting</text>
  <text start="281.5" dur="5.85">with Xi Jinping coming up very soon in</text>
  <text start="284.44" dur="10.89">January of 2019 and as a goodwill</text>

  <text start="306.27" dur="5.28">controlling a lot of what&amp;#39;s been going</text>

  <text start="311.55" dur="7.98">and Putin they&amp;#39;re all on the same page</text>
  <text start="314.009" dur="8.101">now Trump has tweeted out that he just</text>

  <text start="379.68" dur="7.37">planning on using this part of the</text>
  <text start="381.599" dur="8.451">narrative to explain why the economy is</text>
  <text start="387.05" dur="7.63">deteriorating remember the IMF the biz</text>

  <text start="438.55" dur="4.56">mainstream media trying to figure out</text>
  <text start="440.62" dur="4.65">how they can control the narrative</text>
  <text start="443.11" dur="4.799">here&amp;#39;s the latest one out of Washington</text>
  <text start="445.27" dur="4.619">Post the headline reads the Federal</text>
  <text start="447.909" dur="5.76">Reserve took Donald Trump&amp;#39;s advice on</text>
  <text start="449.889" dur="6.301">interest rates now he&amp;#39;s not happy well</text>
  <text start="453.669" dur="4.831">first of all the Fed really didn&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="456.19" dur="3.719">his advice they didn&amp;#39;t stop it they</text>
  <text start="458.5" dur="3.509">raised the interest rates in December</text>
  <text start="459.909" dur="6.66">and they said they&amp;#39;re gonna do it two</text>
  <text start="462.009" dur="6.78">more times in 2019 maybe three now of</text>
  <text start="466.569" dur="3.75">course as we know with cue we knew that</text>
  <text start="468.789" dur="4.47">this was going to happen this is part of</text>
  <text start="470.319" dur="5.791">the plan now remember they started out</text>
  <text start="473.259" dur="3.991">with the tweet that Trump put out there</text>
  <text start="476.11" dur="3.959">and this is coming from the Washington</text>
  <text start="477.25" dur="5.46">Post they included this in their article</text>
  <text start="480.069" dur="3.481">and that remember the tweet it was the</text>
  <text start="482.71" dur="3.239">tweet from Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="483.55" dur="4.679">the only problem our economy has is the</text>
  <text start="485.949" dur="4.44">Fed they don&amp;#39;t have a feel for the</text>
  <text start="488.229" dur="3.84">market they don&amp;#39;t understand necessary</text>
  <text start="490.389" dur="4.53">trade wars or strong dollars or even</text>
  <text start="492.069" dur="5.07">Democratic shutdowns over borders the</text>
  <text start="494.919" dur="4.291">Fed is like a powerful golfer who can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="497.139" dur="7.59">score because he has no touch he can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="499.21" dur="8.489">putt now the Washington Post then went</text>
  <text start="504.729" dur="4.951">on to say Trump has tethered the success</text>
  <text start="507.699" dur="4.47">of his presidency to the stock market</text>
  <text start="509.68" dur="4.289">now what they&amp;#39;re trying to do here is</text>
  <text start="512.169" dur="4.41">when the stock market comes down they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="513.969" dur="6.301">trying to say that Trump is responsible</text>
  <text start="516.579" dur="7.08">for the stock market now once again what</text>
  <text start="520.27" dur="4.89">is Trump doing Trump is pointing the</text>
  <text start="523.659" dur="4.141">finger at the Fed saying every time they</text>
  <text start="525.16" dur="3.75">raise the rates the market comes down so</text>
  <text start="527.8" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re trying to make it seem like</text>
  <text start="528.91" dur="6.39">Trump is tethered to the markets Trump</text>
  <text start="532.54" dur="5.46">is saying no it&amp;#39;s the feds fault</text>
  <text start="535.3" dur="4.8">look what Trump did over Christmas he</text>
  <text start="538" dur="5.55">said listen the companies are doing</text>
  <text start="540.1" dur="5.549">great in my opinion I would go ahead and</text>
  <text start="543.55" dur="4.68">buy the dip what happened the next</text>
  <text start="545.649" dur="6.451">couple of days the market went up he has</text>
  <text start="548.23" dur="5.729">control of the magic one so the article</text>
  <text start="552.1" dur="4.08">went on to say ironically Trump is</text>
  <text start="553.959" dur="4.801">blaming the man he appointed less than a</text>
  <text start="556.18" dur="4.59">year ago for the hikes even while</text>
  <text start="558.76" dur="4.62">claiming he is not blaming</text>
  <text start="560.77" dur="4.83">and perhaps even more ironic is that the</text>
  <text start="563.38" dur="4.2">Fed is heating Trump&amp;#39;s past advice on</text>
  <text start="565.6" dur="5.1">interest rates well really did they</text>
  <text start="567.58" dur="4.47">heated advice no all they said was we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="570.7" dur="5.31">gonna raise him in December which they</text>
  <text start="572.05" dur="6.72">did and they said okay instead of three</text>
  <text start="576.01" dur="5.07">times or four times in 2019 maybe we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="578.77" dur="5.34">do it two or three times that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="581.08" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;ve done and they&amp;#39;re still on the</text>
  <text start="584.11" dur="3.78">same path remember we only have to hit</text>
  <text start="586" dur="4.56">around 3% and that&amp;#39;s when everything</text>
  <text start="587.89" dur="4.44">really starts to fall apart that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="590.56" dur="3.66">magic number we had the same magic</text>
  <text start="592.33" dur="3.87">number about going back to 2006</text>
  <text start="594.22" dur="4.08">they had a certain they had a hit a</text>
  <text start="596.2" dur="3.3">certain interest rate magic number and</text>
  <text start="598.3" dur="3.06">then the economy started to fall apart</text>
  <text start="599.5" dur="4.14">and then they dropped the interest rates</text>
  <text start="601.36" dur="5.4">like an elevator falling down the shaft</text>
  <text start="603.64" dur="4.79">here the article went on to say but even</text>
  <text start="606.76" dur="4.199">with historically low interest rate</text>
  <text start="608.43" dur="5.86">Trump has called the Fed his biggest</text>
  <text start="610.959" dur="4.651">threat which it is and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="614.29" dur="5.7">trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying to figure</text>
  <text start="615.61" dur="6.9">out a way on how to tether Trump to the</text>
  <text start="619.99" dur="4.74">market they&amp;#39;re trying to say the Fed is</text>
  <text start="622.51" dur="4.139">listening but Trump doesn&amp;#39;t like it and</text>
  <text start="624.73" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out a way and</text>
  <text start="626.649" dur="4.44">how they can control this narrative but</text>
  <text start="629.02" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s not going to work because every</text>
  <text start="631.089" dur="4.531">time the market comes down he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="633.07" dur="4.709">gonna point the finger at the Fed and he</text>
  <text start="635.62" dur="4.38">can time this perfectly every single</text>
  <text start="637.779" dur="5.491">time you know why because he has the</text>
  <text start="640" dur="4.89">magic wand now we&amp;#39;ve said in the past</text>
  <text start="643.27" dur="4.11">that there going to be more articles</text>
  <text start="644.89" dur="4.259">coming out against the Fed we see out of</text>
  <text start="647.38" dur="3.99">the aspen times last time we reported</text>
