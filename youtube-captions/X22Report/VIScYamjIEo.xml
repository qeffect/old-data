  <text start="135.7" dur="4.98">mainstream media by the deep state the</text>
  <text start="137.59" dur="6.54">central bank their plan was to bring</text>
  <text start="140.68" dur="5.94">down the economy and they thought they</text>
  <text start="144.13" dur="5.94">were in control and they had all the</text>
  <text start="146.62" dur="6.869">power and we saw Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="150.07" dur="7.08">make their move Trump of the Patriots</text>
  <text start="153.489" dur="7.741">control the central bank</text>
  <text start="157.15" dur="6.36">the central bank the Fed decided okay</text>
  <text start="161.23" dur="6.509">we&amp;#39;re going to be patient on interest</text>
  <text start="163.51" dur="6.899">rates were gonna put a hold on it we see</text>
  <text start="167.739" dur="5.371">Trump out there saying listen we might</text>
  <text start="170.409" dur="4.591">give an extension to the tariffs for</text>
  <text start="173.11" dur="5.61">China because the trade negotiations are</text>
  <text start="175" dur="7.29">going on right now we see all of this</text>
  <text start="178.72" dur="6.09">happening at the same time now the Fed</text>
  <text start="182.29" dur="6.69">came out with their minutes today and it</text>
  <text start="184.81" dur="9.09">shows that Trump well it looks like he</text>
  <text start="188.98" dur="8.369">completely shifted the economy away from</text>
  <text start="193.9" dur="7.05">the recession completely the Patriots</text>
  <text start="197.349" dur="7.831">are in full control and we need to</text>
  <text start="200.95" dur="7.11">understand that the central bank is the</text>
  <text start="205.18" dur="5.85">root of all evil here think about what</text>
  <text start="208.06" dur="5.97">has been happening to this country think</text>
  <text start="211.03" dur="6.239">about everything that has been going on</text>
  <text start="214.03" dur="4.829">all the recessions the ups and downs yes</text>
  <text start="217.269" dur="3.631">there are certain people that make money</text>
  <text start="218.859" dur="5.331">then there are certain people that lose</text>
  <text start="220.9" dur="6.72">money but the majority of the people are</text>
  <text start="224.19" dur="6.1">dependent some way somehow on the</text>
  <text start="227.62" dur="6.06">government where there are others who</text>
  <text start="230.29" dur="5.43">are just barely getting by and this is</text>
  <text start="233.68" dur="4.41">what the central banks like they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="235.72" dur="6.449">care if their small percentage makes it</text>
  <text start="238.09" dur="8.039">to the top as long as the majority they</text>
  <text start="242.169" dur="8.04">struggle now if we look at household</text>
  <text start="246.129" dur="6.75">debt it hit another all-time high so how</text>
  <text start="250.209" dur="6.83">do you control the people you control</text>
  <text start="252.879" dur="8.79">them through debt you keep them enslaved</text>
  <text start="257.039" dur="10.681">now we hit thirteen point five trillion</text>
  <text start="261.669" dur="9.06">dollars in household debt this is</text>
  <text start="267.72" dur="7.84">unbelievable it&amp;#39;s higher than where we</text>
  <text start="270.729" dur="8.671">were in 2008 now the question is why are</text>
  <text start="275.56" dur="4.68">so many people in debt think about this</text>
  <text start="279.4" dur="5.43">for a second</text>
  <text start="280.24" dur="8.29">why can&amp;#39;t people take their currency and</text>
  <text start="284.83" dur="7.07">live off their currency</text>
  <text start="288.53" dur="5.56">because the central bank&amp;#39;s plan was not</text>
  <text start="291.9" dur="5.37">to allow you to live off the currency in</text>
  <text start="294.09" dur="6.419">that fashion they need to keep you in</text>
  <text start="297.27" dur="7.079">debt if you look around the world why</text>
  <text start="300.509" dur="6.961">does every country need to borrow and</text>
  <text start="304.349" dur="6.481">why are they in debt why are the people</text>
  <text start="307.47" dur="7.02">around the world in debt is there any</text>
  <text start="310.83" dur="7.08">reason the people of a country need to</text>
  <text start="314.49" dur="6.41">be in debt well the only reason you</text>
  <text start="317.91" dur="7.8">would need to be in debt is because the</text>
  <text start="320.9" dur="8.1">value of that currency declines and it</text>
  <text start="325.71" dur="8.519">declines over time and as it declines</text>
  <text start="329" dur="7.93">you can&amp;#39;t live I mean you are not to be</text>
  <text start="334.229" dur="4.921">blamed for what is happening those</text>
  <text start="336.93" dur="4.14">people who don&amp;#39;t have jobs those people</text>
  <text start="339.15" dur="5.48">who are barely getting by those people</text>
  <text start="341.07" dur="7.379">who are delinquent on paying their bills</text>
  <text start="344.63" dur="7.99">because you had to do what you had to do</text>
  <text start="348.449" dur="8.161">to survive because the system is</text>
  <text start="352.62" dur="5.49">designed that way to make you suffer and</text>
  <text start="356.61" dur="4.799">hopefully make you dependent on the</text>
  <text start="358.11" dur="7.44">government and this way the central</text>
  <text start="361.409" dur="7.98">banks have full control think about it</text>
  <text start="365.55" dur="8.82">if we had a system that was backed by</text>
  <text start="369.389" dur="10.83">gold silver or something that had</text>
  <text start="374.37" dur="9.06">substance and the government what is not</text>
  <text start="380.219" dur="5.54">allowed to just a create currency out of</text>
  <text start="383.43" dur="4.59">thin air whenever they wanted</text>
  <text start="385.759" dur="5.201">because there&amp;#39;d be checks and balances</text>
  <text start="388.02" dur="6.6">and they couldn&amp;#39;t create more than there</text>
  <text start="390.96" dur="6.299">was in reserves they couldn&amp;#39;t create</text>
  <text start="394.62" dur="4.74">more currency because we wouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="397.259" dur="3.78">more gold we wouldn&amp;#39;t have more silver</text>
  <text start="399.36" dur="5.279">so they would just be making more</text>
  <text start="401.039" dur="5.401">dollars and the amount of gold and</text>
  <text start="404.639" dur="4.261">silver would be the exact same thing so</text>
  <text start="406.44" dur="6.509">there there would be checks and balances</text>
  <text start="408.9" dur="5.34">so if we go back in time prior to 1913</text>
  <text start="412.949" dur="5.311">before the Federal Reserve came into</text>
  <text start="414.24" dur="6.97">existence what do we have back then we</text>
  <text start="418.26" dur="7.35">had a system that was backed by gold</text>
  <text start="421.21" dur="10.34">you were able to go into a store and</text>
  <text start="425.61" dur="9.79">take out a penny and buy candy maybe two</text>
  <text start="431.55" dur="8.5">pieces of gum something else that was in</text>
  <text start="435.4" dur="8.6">the store but the penny was worth a lot</text>
  <text start="440.05" dur="7.41">more back then than it is today</text>
  <text start="444" dur="8.4">today you really can&amp;#39;t get anything for</text>
  <text start="447.46" dur="10.2">a penny because the central bank system</text>
  <text start="452.4" dur="7.42">devalued the currency over time and how</text>
  <text start="457.66" dur="4.979">do you compete how do you live how do</text>
  <text start="459.82" dur="6.51">you function in a system that</text>
  <text start="462.639" dur="7.681">continually devalues what you&amp;#39;re holding</text>
  <text start="466.33" dur="6.63">it becomes very very difficult you have</text>
  <text start="470.32" dur="5.819">to resort to credit cards you have to</text>
  <text start="472.96" dur="7.95">resort to borrowing and this is why the</text>
  <text start="476.139" dur="7.141">country is so far in debt and once</text>
  <text start="480.91" dur="5.189">you&amp;#39;re in that debt and things become</text>
  <text start="483.28" dur="7.139">even more difficult you then are</text>
  <text start="486.099" dur="9.871">delinquent on paying this debt back this</text>
  <text start="490.419" dur="10.56">is a no-win situation and this is how</text>
  <text start="495.97" dur="7.259">the central bank works and this is why</text>
  <text start="500.979" dur="5.43">Trump of the Patriots are moving to get</text>
  <text start="503.229" dur="8.581">rid of the central bank now if we look</text>
  <text start="506.409" dur="8.731">at the Fed minutes we see that almost</text>
  <text start="511.81" dur="5.669">all the participants thought that it</text>
  <text start="515.14" dur="5.97">would be a desirable to announce before</text>
  <text start="517.479" dur="6.391">too long a plan to stop reducing the</text>
  <text start="521.11" dur="7.41">Federal Reserve&amp;#39;s asset Holdings later</text>
  <text start="523.87" dur="8.64">this year think about what they just did</text>
  <text start="528.52" dur="9.33">here the Fed said listen we&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="532.51" dur="7.38">to reduce our asset Holdings later this</text>
  <text start="537.85" dur="5.46">year and a lot of the participants said</text>
  <text start="539.89" dur="6.33">this would be a very good idea so to</text>
  <text start="543.31" dur="5.969">bring down the economy the Fed decided</text>
  <text start="546.22" dur="4.32">they were going to get rid of a lot of</text>
  <text start="549.279" dur="2.761">their assets that were on the books</text>
  <text start="550.54" dur="3.51">because remember they bought like four</text>
  <text start="552.04" dur="2.97">trillion dollars worth of toxic real</text>
  <text start="554.05" dur="4.5">estate and everything else</text>
  <text start="555.01" dur="6.03">and they wanted to get rid of it by but</text>
  <text start="558.55" dur="6.18">by getting rid of it they were causing</text>
  <text start="561.04" dur="5.61">problems in the market by raising the</text>
  <text start="564.73" dur="5.27">interest rates they were causing</text>
  <text start="566.65" dur="6.15">problems in the market and the economy</text>
  <text start="570" dur="6.73">Trump and the Patriots as you can see</text>
  <text start="572.8" dur="7.46">number one the Fed said they&amp;#39;ll continue</text>
  <text start="576.73" dur="6.36">holding on the interest rates number two</text>
  <text start="580.26" dur="5.77">they&amp;#39;re all in agreement that they</text>
  <text start="583.09" dur="6.66">should have a plan to stop reducing the</text>
  <text start="586.03" dur="5.46">Federal Reserve asset Holdings so</text>
  <text start="589.75" dur="8.28">they&amp;#39;re gonna hold on to all those</text>
  <text start="591.49" dur="8.91">assets number three Trump and G decided</text>
  <text start="598.03" dur="5.46">okay to keep the system going we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="600.4" dur="6.66">going to inject a lot of currency into</text>
  <text start="603.49" dur="7.62">the system and this is why China started</text>
  <text start="607.06" dur="8.94">to monetize or create currency and</text>
  <text start="611.11" dur="8.84">inject it into the system what we see</text>
  <text start="616" dur="9.63">here is complete and total control of</text>
  <text start="619.95" dur="10.81">the system the system will not break</text>
  <text start="625.63" dur="7.77">apart in 2020 Trump the Patriots they</text>
  <text start="630.76" dur="4.62">have other plans for the central bank</text>
  <text start="633.4" dur="4.38">and you can see just from what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="635.38" dur="7.29">looking at here they are in complete</text>
  <text start="637.78" dur="8.88">control of the central bank and I do</text>
  <text start="642.67" dur="6.72">believe the deep state those bad guys in</text>
  <text start="646.66" dur="6.3">the central bank they don&amp;#39;t know what to</text>
  <text start="649.39" dur="6.39">do at this point because the entire plan</text>
  <text start="652.96" dur="5.13">is starting to come together and what do</text>
  <text start="655.78" dur="5.76">I mean by that think about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="658.09" dur="6.18">happening with Mueller and the report</text>
  <text start="661.54" dur="6.09">and what Trump and the Patriots have</text>
  <text start="664.27" dur="7.92">been planning for the protection is gone</text>
  <text start="667.63" dur="8.66">for Clinton and others all of this is</text>
  <text start="672.19" dur="8.97">going to happen in a certain order and</text>
  <text start="676.29" dur="7.54">first you need to show that there are</text>
  <text start="681.16" dur="4.97">certain corrupt individuals treasonous</text>
  <text start="683.83" dur="5.13">individuals and bring them to justice</text>
  <text start="686.13" dur="6.19">can&amp;#39;t have the economy fall apart</text>
  <text start="688.96" dur="7.2">while you&amp;#39;re doing this once this is all</text>
  <text start="692.32" dur="6.63">said and done and people understand what</text>
  <text start="696.16" dur="5.46">has been happening in our country how</text>
  <text start="698.95" dur="5.16">much easier would it be to go and</text>
  <text start="701.62" dur="6.51">believe Trump to go after the central</text>
  <text start="704.11" dur="6.51">bank a lot easier this is why Trump</text>
  <text start="708.13" dur="5.73">started to contradict the Fed this is</text>
  <text start="710.62" dur="6.72">why they&amp;#39;ve been pushing the agenda</text>
  <text start="713.86" dur="7.35">right now to stop the recession in 2020</text>
  <text start="717.34" dur="7.17">they need certain parts of the plan to</text>
  <text start="721.21" dur="6.81">hit first before they go after the</text>
  <text start="724.51" dur="5.1">central bank and once everything is said</text>
  <text start="728.02" dur="3.99">and done and people brought to justice</text>
  <text start="729.61" dur="5.52">then we have the trials and things like</text>
  <text start="732.01" dur="5.76">that people will be looking at Trump</text>
  <text start="735.13" dur="6.06">people will understand people will be</text>
  <text start="737.77" dur="7.05">awake and they&amp;#39;ll start to realize why</text>
  <text start="741.19" dur="5.34">do we have a central bank why would</text>
  <text start="744.82" dur="3.54">people think this why would people say</text>
  <text start="746.53" dur="4.35">to themselves why do we have a central</text>
  <text start="748.36" dur="5.43">bank because this would be the next</text>
  <text start="750.88" dur="7.01">point in the plan this is what Trump</text>
  <text start="753.79" dur="7.05">would start pushing and people around</text>
  <text start="757.89" dur="5.83">the country will go along with him</text>
  <text start="760.84" dur="6.06">because he will tell the people would</text>
  <text start="763.72" dur="6.36">you rather have a system without taxes</text>
  <text start="766.9" dur="5.28">would you rather have a system where we</text>
  <text start="770.08" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t have to borrow from a private</text>
  <text start="772.18" dur="5.01">central bank would you rather have a</text>
  <text start="774.58" dur="7.14">system that has checks and balances that</text>
  <text start="777.19" dur="11.4">could defeat corruption and he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="781.72" dur="10.65">show them how how we can do this and the</text>
  <text start="788.59" dur="8.07">people around the country who once hated</text>
  <text start="792.37" dur="8.64">him will say yes please this is what we</text>
  <text start="796.66" dur="6.21">want we trust you now and once he has</text>
  <text start="801.01" dur="5.21">the people with him he&amp;#39;s gonna tell them</text>
  <text start="802.87" dur="7.17">this is not going to be an easy task</text>
