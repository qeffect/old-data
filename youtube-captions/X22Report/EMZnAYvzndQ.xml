  <text start="104.429" dur="5.761">Jinping Putin they&amp;#39;re working together</text>
  <text start="107.039" dur="6.631">to get rid of the central bank and we</text>
  <text start="110.19" dur="6">can see already that the entire plan is</text>
  <text start="113.67" dur="6.509">in motion now we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="116.19" dur="6.09">real estate GDP unemployment and we look</text>
  <text start="120.179" dur="3.601">at numbers and we say oh look things</text>
  <text start="122.28" dur="3.72">aren&amp;#39;t going well look in the real</text>
  <text start="123.78" dur="4.53">estate market we can see prices are</text>
  <text start="126" dur="5.19">coming down traffic is drawing up in</text>
  <text start="128.31" dur="4.83">certain areas and we always look at</text>
  <text start="131.19" dur="3.96">numbers but now when we look at</text>
  <text start="133.14" dur="4.22">companies that actually handle the</text>
  <text start="135.15" dur="5.25">mortgage applications like Wells Fargo</text>
  <text start="137.36" dur="4.09">remember Wells Fargo&amp;#39;s mortgage</text>
  <text start="140.4" dur="3.03">department that was their bread and</text>
  <text start="141.45" dur="4.95">butter for their entire business and yes</text>
  <text start="143.43" dur="5.79">I know they&amp;#39;ve been in a lot of trouble</text>
  <text start="146.4" dur="4.89">with you know client information and</text>
  <text start="149.22" dur="4.95">things like that but when we look at</text>
  <text start="151.29" dur="6.059">Wells Fargo right now they reported the</text>
  <text start="154.17" dur="6.36">worst set of mortgage numbers since the</text>
  <text start="157.349" dur="6.06">financial crisis with both mortgage</text>
  <text start="160.53" dur="6">applications and mortgage originations</text>
  <text start="163.409" dur="6.481">they are both tumbling to levels not</text>
  <text start="166.53" dur="7.379">seen in a decade and if you go back in</text>
  <text start="169.89" dur="8.37">time you can see how their entire</text>
  <text start="173.909" dur="6.211">mortgage department how the applications</text>
  <text start="178.26" dur="4.8">the mortgage originations how they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="180.12" dur="4.199">been declining since 2013 now this just</text>
  <text start="183.06" dur="3.329">didn&amp;#39;t happen overnight</text>
  <text start="184.319" dur="2.281">because they got into trouble you know</text>
  <text start="186.389" dur="2.311">and</text>
  <text start="186.6" dur="4.05">20:16 or whatever the date was and all</text>
  <text start="188.7" dur="3.81">of a sudden you know they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="190.65" dur="5.07">get their image back this has been</text>
  <text start="192.51" dur="5.46">ongoing since that period of time and</text>
  <text start="195.72" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s getting worse and worse</text>
  <text start="197.97" dur="7.05">as time goes on now Wells Fargo because</text>
  <text start="200.7" dur="7.26">of this they&amp;#39;re going to be cutting 638</text>
  <text start="205.02" dur="4.77">mortgage employees and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="207.96" dur="6.45">it&amp;#39;s because of the crippling slowdown</text>
  <text start="209.79" dur="9.63">in their mortgage business and once</text>
  <text start="214.41" dur="7.38">again we saw this back in 2007 going</text>
  <text start="219.42" dur="4.74">into 2000 the housing market really hit</text>
  <text start="221.79" dur="5.64">you saw a lot of individuals being laid</text>
  <text start="224.16" dur="4.44">off in the mortgage arena we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="227.43" dur="4.62">the same thing right now</text>
  <text start="228.6" dur="5.4">so the entire system is breaking down</text>
  <text start="232.05" dur="4.02">and every time we look at something else</text>
  <text start="234" dur="5.46">we can see that it&amp;#39;s hitting something</text>
  <text start="236.07" dur="7.31">else and confirming us to us that yes it</text>
  <text start="239.46" dur="6.5">is breaking down now we know that Trump</text>
  <text start="243.38" dur="6.01">Putin Xi Jingping</text>
  <text start="245.96" dur="6.4">they&amp;#39;re working together to bring down</text>
  <text start="249.39" dur="5.28">this central bank system and of course</text>
  <text start="252.36" dur="3.9">Trump has made some announcement saying</text>
  <text start="254.67" dur="3.39">that you know he doesn&amp;#39;t believe that</text>
  <text start="256.26" dur="2.61">the Fed should be raising rates at this</text>
  <text start="258.06" dur="2.76">point in time</text>
  <text start="258.87" dur="5.7">he thought that Powell was going to be</text>
  <text start="260.82" dur="5.82">the easy money type of Fed Chairman like</text>
  <text start="264.57" dur="3.42">we used to have he&amp;#39;s very upset about</text>
  <text start="266.64" dur="4.17">this why would he be raising interest</text>
  <text start="267.99" dur="5.22">rates during a period of time when the</text>
  <text start="270.81" dur="5.37">debt is coming due when the economy is</text>
  <text start="273.21" dur="4.71">doing so well what would be the point of</text>
  <text start="276.18" dur="4.23">all this and we know that when the Fed</text>
  <text start="277.92" dur="4.2">raises rates the whole thing starts to</text>
  <text start="280.41" dur="4.08">break down because it&amp;#39;s based on an</text>
  <text start="282.12" dur="4.29">illusion and I think a lot of people</text>
  <text start="284.49" dur="5.55">don&amp;#39;t understand what is happening here</text>
  <text start="286.41" dur="6.84">the entire system going all the way back</text>
  <text start="290.04" dur="5.28">to 2008 since that crash and before that</text>
  <text start="293.25" dur="4.17">but it really accepted accelerated</text>
  <text start="295.32" dur="3.87">during that period of time they created</text>
  <text start="297.42" dur="3.27">this gigantic illusion by manipulating</text>
  <text start="299.19" dur="3.69">all the numbers and the numbers have</text>
  <text start="300.69" dur="4.38">been manipulated before that but they</text>
  <text start="302.88" dur="3.15">really took it into overdrive during</text>
  <text start="305.07" dur="2.61">this period of time because they</text>
  <text start="306.03" dur="4.11">realized there was no way they were</text>
  <text start="307.68" dur="7.11">going to explain the economy away unless</text>
  <text start="310.14" dur="6.06">they manipulated the numbers and since</text>
  <text start="314.79" dur="4.29">they manipulated the numbers they</text>
  <text start="316.2" dur="4.08">created this gigantic illusion in many</text>
  <text start="319.08" dur="3.809">different sectors of the</text>
  <text start="320.28" dur="4.44">economy and a lot of it doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="322.889" dur="4.081">make sense because you&amp;#39;re seeing retail</text>
  <text start="324.72" dur="4.32">breakdown you&amp;#39;re seeing manufacturing</text>
  <text start="326.97" dur="4.169">slow we know the unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="329.04" dur="3.48">are completely fake phony and false but</text>
  <text start="331.139" dur="5.341">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this is</text>
  <text start="332.52" dur="7.17">what Trump said that he thought Jerome</text>
  <text start="336.48" dur="6.63">Powell was going to create more currency</text>
  <text start="339.69" dur="5.31">and he continually calls out Powell</text>
  <text start="343.11" dur="4.23">saying he doesn&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a good time</text>
  <text start="345" dur="4.11">to raise interest rates and it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="347.34" dur="4.29">good time because debt is coming due and</text>
  <text start="349.11" dur="6.57">I believe what is happening here is that</text>
  <text start="351.63" dur="7.47">he&amp;#39;s using the strategy to make everyone</text>
  <text start="355.68" dur="6.66">believe that he&amp;#39;s against Powell in what</text>
  <text start="359.1" dur="4.89">he&amp;#39;s doing actually now that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="362.34" dur="4.8">thinking about and I see the strategy</text>
  <text start="363.99" dur="7.32">that Trump uses and the way Q reports on</text>
  <text start="367.14" dur="7.43">what is going on here Powell and Trump</text>
  <text start="371.31" dur="6.18">might be working together in all of this</text>
  <text start="374.57" dur="6.61">because Powell says he&amp;#39;s gonna continue</text>
  <text start="377.49" dur="7.62">with raising the rates and what Trump</text>
  <text start="381.18" dur="6.27">does with this strategy is to make the</text>
  <text start="385.11" dur="5.22">corporate media come out and say we need</text>
  <text start="387.45" dur="5.64">to keep this individual you can&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="390.33" dur="5.52">anything about the Fed how dare you</text>
  <text start="393.09" dur="6.63">mention the Fed at all actually in a</text>
  <text start="395.85" dur="6.23">negative way and he&amp;#39;s calling out Powell</text>
  <text start="399.72" dur="4.819">just like he&amp;#39;s calling out sessions</text>
  <text start="402.08" dur="6.13">making everyone think the opposite and</text>
  <text start="404.539" dur="6.701">Powell is going to raise interest rates</text>
  <text start="408.21" dur="4.56">he&amp;#39;s not going to be this easy money</text>
  <text start="411.24" dur="3.63">even though they&amp;#39;re still printing this</text>
  <text start="412.77" dur="4.53">easy money type of Fed he&amp;#39;s going to do</text>
  <text start="414.87" dur="5.79">things a little differently and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="417.3" dur="6.48">very interesting about this is that Fed</text>
  <text start="420.66" dur="6.81">chair Powell said higher interest rates</text>
  <text start="423.78" dur="6.21">are making the economy healthier for</text>
  <text start="427.47" dur="5.37">staving off the risks of overheating and</text>
  <text start="429.99" dur="4.71">asset bubbles now we both know that</text>
  <text start="432.84" dur="4.44">Trump knows there&amp;#39;s tons of asset</text>
  <text start="434.7" dur="5.1">bubbles he said it before he was</text>
  <text start="437.28" dur="4.05">president he knows that the stock</text>
  <text start="439.8" dur="3.08">markets in a bubble he knows the housing</text>
  <text start="441.33" dur="5.22">markets in a bubble</text>
  <text start="442.88" dur="6.76">Powell also stressed further increases</text>
  <text start="446.55" dur="5.79">in base borrowing costs would continue</text>
  <text start="449.64" dur="4.32">as long as economic growth keeps its</text>
  <text start="452.34" dur="5.08">momentum</text>
  <text start="453.96" dur="6.49">he said the economy is strong inflation</text>
  <text start="457.42" dur="6.21">is her is around 2% most people who want</text>
  <text start="460.45" dur="5.57">a job are finding one if the strong</text>
  <text start="463.63" dur="5.4">growth and income and jobs continue</text>
  <text start="466.02" dur="5.74">further gradual increases in the target</text>
  <text start="469.03" dur="5.55">range for the federal funds rate will</text>
  <text start="471.76" dur="4.68">likely be appropriate powell stressed</text>
  <text start="474.58" dur="6.21">that the central bank&amp;#39;s policy approach</text>
  <text start="476.44" dur="6.9">remains data dependent and every</text>
  <text start="480.79" dur="5">decision to raise rates or it leave them</text>
  <text start="483.34" dur="6.51">unchanged comes after a fresh batch of</text>
  <text start="485.79" dur="6.7">inflation and employment data the Fed</text>
  <text start="489.85" dur="4.5">chair stressed this allows them to</text>
  <text start="492.49" dur="5.51">minimize the risk of policy mistakes</text>
  <text start="494.35" dur="7.02">that could actually hurt GDP growth now</text>
  <text start="498" dur="5.11">we know that they recalculated GDP they</text>
  <text start="501.37" dur="3.84">manipulated it to make you think that</text>
  <text start="503.11" dur="3.66">GDP is a lot higher than it is</text>
  <text start="505.21" dur="5.19">we know that unemployment numbers are</text>
  <text start="506.77" dur="7.11">manipulated and by these statements it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="510.4" dur="6.78">telling us that he&amp;#39;s working hand in</text>
  <text start="513.88" dur="6.719">hand with Trump to show that the</text>
  <text start="517.18" dur="5.04">economy&amp;#39;s doing well and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="520.599" dur="2.88">to raise interest rates and I believe</text>
  <text start="522.22" dur="4.29">this is the narrative they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="523.479" dur="5.671">be setting up here this is the push to</text>
  <text start="526.51" dur="4.83">take down the central bank because they</text>
  <text start="529.15" dur="5.55">both know that this is going to bring</text>
  <text start="531.34" dur="6.42">down the central bank system and Trump</text>
  <text start="534.7" dur="6.63">is out there and he was asked if he</text>
  <text start="537.76" dur="5.37">believed in the feds independence well</text>
  <text start="541.33" dur="5.04">he kind of sidetracked the whole entire</text>
  <text start="543.13" dur="7.8">question Trump said I believe in the Fed</text>
  <text start="546.37" dur="7.08">doing what&amp;#39;s good for the country he&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="550.93" dur="5.91">really didn&amp;#39;t answer the question which</text>
  <text start="553.45" dur="6.36">tells you he doesn&amp;#39;t believe in the feds</text>
  <text start="556.84" dur="6.42">independence and of course if he came</text>
  <text start="559.81" dur="6.27">out and said no I don&amp;#39;t believe in the</text>
  <text start="563.26" dur="5.31">feds independence well this would been a</text>
  <text start="566.08" dur="3.69">huge mistake because the mainstream</text>
  <text start="568.57" dur="3.9">media would have been all over this</text>
  <text start="569.77" dur="5.49">instead he sidetracked it&amp;#39;s saying I</text>
  <text start="572.47" dur="7.26">believe in the in the Fed doing what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="575.26" dur="7.05">good for the country now of course he</text>
  <text start="579.73" dur="3.12">knows the feds not doing what&amp;#39;s good for</text>
  <text start="582.31" dur="2.52">the country</text>
  <text start="582.85" dur="4.679">he knows the Fed is a private</text>
  <text start="584.83" dur="5.4">corporation and then they ask them</text>
  <text start="587.529" dur="5.191">a question about Powell are you happy</text>
  <text start="590.23" dur="6.479">with Powell and Trump said the following</text>
  <text start="592.72" dur="9.059">I am happy with my choice and I&amp;#39;ll let</text>
  <text start="596.709" dur="10.17">you know in seven years so what that</text>
  <text start="601.779" dur="8.701">tells us is that the entire system that</text>
  <text start="606.879" dur="9.12">we know today is going to be brought</text>
  <text start="610.48" dur="7.95">down within this period of time with in</text>
  <text start="615.999" dur="4.291">this period of time of Trump being</text>
  <text start="618.43" dur="5.069">president and he&amp;#39;s also pushing it out</text>
  <text start="620.29" dur="5.489">that he&amp;#39;s going to be President the next</text>
  <text start="623.499" dur="4.26">term because both terms add them</text>
  <text start="625.779" dur="5.04">together four plus four is eight that be</text>
  <text start="627.759" dur="5.37">eight years in seven years he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="630.819" dur="5.731">that we will find out if this whole</text>
  <text start="633.129" dur="8.161">thing worked and I do believe at this</text>
  <text start="636.55" dur="7.579">point that Powell might be working with</text>
  <text start="641.29" dur="7.099">Trump Putin Xi Jingping</text>
  <text start="644.129" dur="7.18">to bring this entire system down and</text>
  <text start="648.389" dur="4.45">Russia is out there and we know more</text>
  <text start="651.309" dur="4.26">sanctions were placed on certain</text>
  <text start="652.839" dur="6.35">corporations we see that the Russian</text>
  <text start="655.569" dur="7.531">Foreign Minister Deputy Foreign Minister</text>
  <text start="659.189" dur="6.52">Sergei Ryabkov said that since these</text>
  <text start="663.1" dur="5.849">sanctions were put into place thank God</text>
  <text start="665.709" dur="5.911">all of this is happening Russia is going</text>
  <text start="668.949" dur="5.76">to be moving away from the dollar it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="671.62" dur="4.68">time to ditch the dollar now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="674.709" dur="3.961">interesting about all all of this that</text>
  <text start="676.3" dur="5.13">were we&amp;#39;re watching right now is that</text>
  <text start="678.67" dur="6.389">Trump never admits that the Fed is</text>
  <text start="681.43" dur="5.009">independent he says that he&amp;#39;s happy with</text>
  <text start="685.059" dur="7.171">his choice he&amp;#39;ll know seven years from</text>
  <text start="686.439" dur="7.08">now and he also realizes that all the</text>
  <text start="692.23" dur="3.57">countries around the world like Russia</text>
  <text start="693.519" dur="3.451">China and the rest are going to have to</text>
