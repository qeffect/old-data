  <text start="111.72" dur="4.23">completely falling apart and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="114.39" dur="3.54">tracking this we&amp;#39;ve been following this</text>
  <text start="115.95" dur="4.35">and we know that all of this is one</text>
  <text start="117.93" dur="5.22">gigantic illusion we see the stock</text>
  <text start="120.3" dur="4.53">market is being forced down than being</text>
  <text start="123.15" dur="4.44">pushed up and this is the battle that is</text>
  <text start="124.83" dur="6.42">being waged between the two factions but</text>
  <text start="127.59" dur="7.86">while all this is happening the entire</text>
  <text start="131.25" dur="6.72">system is being prepared to move into a</text>
  <text start="135.45" dur="4.88">new system this is the transition this</text>
  <text start="137.97" dur="4.92">is maybe what people call the reset and</text>
  <text start="140.33" dur="4.54">there are going to be states where</text>
  <text start="142.89" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re going to be pushing the idea</text>
  <text start="144.87" dur="5.22">that you can use crypto currencies to</text>
  <text start="148.11" dur="6.21">pay for things soon corporations will</text>
  <text start="150.09" dur="5.94">pay you in crypto coins depending on</text>
  <text start="154.32" dur="4.05">Bitcoin doesn&amp;#39;t matter what it is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="156.03" dur="3.75">going to be on the blockchain and this</text>
  <text start="158.37" dur="3.51">is going to be separate and apart from</text>
  <text start="159.78" dur="5.22">the central banks now the central banks</text>
  <text start="161.88" dur="5.85">they want to take control of this system</text>
  <text start="165" dur="4.32">because remember the law in the United</text>
  <text start="167.73" dur="3.87">States and in many countries around the</text>
  <text start="169.32" dur="4.32">world is that you have to use their</text>
  <text start="171.6" dur="4.65">currency the currency that they create a</text>
  <text start="173.64" dur="6.06">thin air the currency that they create</text>
  <text start="176.25" dur="7.14">and attach interest to and we could see</text>
  <text start="179.7" dur="6.81">already that the transition is already</text>
  <text start="183.39" dur="3.6">beginning in Arizona and this is going</text>
  <text start="186.51" dur="3">to happen</text>
  <text start="186.99" dur="5.04">many more states and pretty soon they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="189.51" dur="6.33">going to be moving away from the Fayette</text>
  <text start="192.03" dur="4.4">dollar now Arizona they took the first</text>
  <text start="195.84" dur="3.03">step</text>
  <text start="196.43" dur="5.35">Arizona Senate they passed a bill on</text>
  <text start="198.87" dur="5.46">February 8th to allow residents in the</text>
  <text start="201.78" dur="6.06">state to pay their taxes with crypto</text>
  <text start="204.33" dur="6.15">currencies and this is Senate bill 10 91</text>
  <text start="207.84" dur="6.51">which intends to enable cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="210.48" dur="6.39">for tax payment and we see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="214.35" dur="6.99">going to allow the people of the state</text>
  <text start="216.87" dur="8.49">to use cryptocurrency as a form of</text>
  <text start="221.34" dur="6.72">payment now the bill was introduced on</text>
  <text start="225.36" dur="4.71">January 10th 2018 and passed by the</text>
  <text start="228.06" dur="4.85">Senate Finance Committee by four to</text>
  <text start="230.07" dur="4.98">three vote on January 24 24th on</text>
  <text start="232.91" dur="6.97">February 8th the Senate passed the bill</text>
  <text start="235.05" dur="7.68">by a margin of about 16 to 13 with one</text>
  <text start="239.88" dur="5.49">no vote now the bill has now been sent</text>
  <text start="242.73" dur="6.36">to Arizona&amp;#39;s House of Representatives if</text>
  <text start="245.37" dur="5.76">the bill is adopted Arizona would become</text>
  <text start="249.09" dur="4.86">the first state in the u.s. to accept</text>
  <text start="251.13" dur="5.97">cryptocurrency tax payments by the year</text>
  <text start="253.95" dur="5.25">2020 and the bill would allow taxpayers</text>
  <text start="257.1" dur="6">of the state to use a payment gateway</text>
  <text start="259.2" dur="5.49">such as Bitcoin litecoin or any other</text>
  <text start="263.1" dur="3.57">cryptocurrency recognized by the</text>
  <text start="264.69" dur="5.13">department using electronic peer-to-peer</text>
  <text start="266.67" dur="5.58">systems this is the beginning stages and</text>
  <text start="269.82" dur="5.76">this is something that the central</text>
  <text start="272.25" dur="5.4">bankers do not like because this the the</text>
  <text start="275.58" dur="4.59">cryptocurrency is the blockchain is out</text>
  <text start="277.65" dur="5.64">of their control you&amp;#39;re not using their</text>
  <text start="280.17" dur="4.53">currency and eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="283.29" dur="2.91">happen just like we see with Amazon and</text>
  <text start="284.7" dur="3.36">Facebook and many other corporations</text>
  <text start="286.2" dur="5.39">they&amp;#39;re going to start to accept</text>
  <text start="288.06" dur="6.9">cryptocurrency as a form of payment soon</text>
  <text start="291.59" dur="5.23">corporations businesses they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="294.96" dur="3.81">paying their employees in cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="296.82" dur="4.26">and eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="298.77" dur="4.59">there will be no need to take that</text>
  <text start="301.08" dur="4.08">cryptocurrency and move it into dollars</text>
  <text start="303.36" dur="3.72">because if you get paid in</text>
  <text start="305.16" dur="4.53">cryptocurrencies and you can purchase</text>
  <text start="307.08" dur="5.37">things in crypto currencies why do you</text>
  <text start="309.69" dur="7.95">need the dollar this is how this system</text>
  <text start="312.45" dur="7.95">is slowly moving to a new system and the</text>
  <text start="317.64" dur="5.339">entire economic structure</text>
  <text start="320.4" dur="4.44">infrastructure needs to be changed to</text>
  <text start="322.979" dur="3.811">handle this and this is the beginning</text>
  <text start="324.84" dur="5.07">stages of building this new</text>
  <text start="326.79" dur="5.37">infrastructure now on the other side the</text>
  <text start="329.91" dur="3.69">central bank&amp;#39;s they don&amp;#39;t want this to</text>
  <text start="332.16" dur="2.34">happen this is why you see the biz out</text>
  <text start="333.6" dur="3.12">there the Bank of International</text>
  <text start="334.5" dur="3.9">Settlements this is the central bank of</text>
  <text start="336.72" dur="4.259">all central bank&amp;#39;s this is why you see</text>
  <text start="338.4" dur="5.16">other central banks that are out there</text>
  <text start="340.979" dur="5.761">saying no this whole crypto thing is</text>
  <text start="343.56" dur="5.76">used for laundering money it&amp;#39;s used by</text>
  <text start="346.74" dur="6.27">terrorists used by criminals we need to</text>
  <text start="349.32" dur="5.94">regulate it we need to use our own type</text>
  <text start="353.01" dur="4.68">of cryptocurrency where everyone can use</text>
  <text start="355.26" dur="6">it and we can control it that&amp;#39;s their</text>
  <text start="357.69" dur="5.58">endgame the opposite side of that is the</text>
  <text start="361.26" dur="4.62">people&amp;#39;s end game is to separate</text>
  <text start="363.27" dur="5.82">themselves from the central banking</text>
  <text start="365.88" dur="5.34">system and as the economy continually</text>
  <text start="369.09" dur="5.49">breaks down we&amp;#39;re going to see the</text>
  <text start="371.22" dur="5.43">entire system move in that direction in</text>
  <text start="374.58" dur="4.08">the direction of moving away from the</text>
  <text start="376.65" dur="4.29">central banks a while at the same time</text>
  <text start="378.66" dur="4.65">the central banks they&amp;#39;re gonna try to</text>
  <text start="380.94" dur="5.22">control the situation so we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="383.31" dur="4.979">have a battle within this whole entire</text>
  <text start="386.16" dur="4.439">system here now Bank of America their</text>
  <text start="388.289" dur="5.521">critical stress signal was just</text>
  <text start="390.599" dur="4.861">triggered and they&amp;#39;re saying that this</text>
  <text start="393.81" dur="4.56">is going to be a disaster and when this</text>
  <text start="395.46" dur="5.519">is triggered the central banks they</text>
  <text start="398.37" dur="5.789">might have to step in and save the day</text>
  <text start="400.979" dur="5.011">and the markets actually calm down when</text>
  <text start="404.159" dur="3.961">the central bank says well we might in</text>
  <text start="405.99" dur="4.679">you know intervene or do something to</text>
  <text start="408.12" dur="4.56">help out but at this time at this point</text>
  <text start="410.669" dur="4.171">we&amp;#39;re not seeing the central banks come</text>
  <text start="412.68" dur="4.44">in and say hey we&amp;#39;re gonna help out here</text>
  <text start="414.84" dur="4.29">well you also see that the market has</text>
  <text start="417.12" dur="4.95">plunged by nearly 8 percent over just</text>
  <text start="419.13" dur="5.25">over the last week and there are losses</text>
  <text start="422.07" dur="3.99">across the board and nearly every asset</text>
  <text start="424.38" dur="3.17">class from stocks to bonds to</text>
  <text start="426.06" dur="4.2">commodities to real estate are</text>
  <text start="427.55" dur="4.48">participating in the pain and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="430.26" dur="4.05">starting to see that the markets right</text>
  <text start="432.03" dur="5.22">now they are warning us that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="434.31" dur="5.4">storm that is heading towards us and</text>
  <text start="437.25" dur="4.53">there is a storm that is heading towards</text>
  <text start="439.71" dur="5.55">us because we understand that this whole</text>
  <text start="441.78" dur="5.49">market is completely manipulated by the</text>
  <text start="445.26" dur="4.2">central bankers it&amp;#39;s manipulated by the</text>
  <text start="447.27" dur="5.369">Trump administration by the deep state</text>
  <text start="449.46" dur="4.389">and we have two sides battling out right</text>
  <text start="452.639" dur="3.221">now and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="453.849" dur="3.66">the market go down it&amp;#39;s going to be pump</text>
  <text start="455.86" dur="3.959">right back up and we&amp;#39;re gonna see this</text>
  <text start="457.509" dur="4.741">happen in the course of the next week or</text>
  <text start="459.819" dur="5.94">the week after that until the entire</text>
  <text start="462.25" dur="5.61">system breaks and the reason why Trump</text>
  <text start="465.759" dur="3.78">has been pushing the market up and</text>
  <text start="467.86" dur="4.38">pushing the idea that the economy is</text>
  <text start="469.539" dur="4.981">fine because the administration and</text>
  <text start="472.24" dur="4.949">those individuals behind this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="474.52" dur="4.919">trying to prepare us for a transition</text>
  <text start="477.189" dur="4.32">into a new system this system that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="479.439" dur="4.41">in right now is one gigantic bubble as a</text>
  <text start="481.509" dur="4.291">Ponzi scheme it&amp;#39;s dead it can&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="483.849" dur="3.391">anywhere on the other hand you have the</text>
  <text start="485.8" dur="3.869">central banks you have the deep state</text>
  <text start="487.24" dur="4.979">where they&amp;#39;re trying to push us into</text>
  <text start="489.669" dur="3.87">their new system and they&amp;#39;re at the</text>
  <text start="492.219" dur="2.88">point right now with all the</text>
  <text start="493.539" dur="3.84">investigations and everything else going</text>
  <text start="495.099" dur="5.07">on where they&amp;#39;re getting ready and</text>
  <text start="497.379" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re are ready to crash the system</text>
  <text start="500.169" dur="5.821">and blame it on Trump now if they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="502.569" dur="5.94">get the crash going and they can&amp;#39;t push</text>
  <text start="505.99" dur="5.459">their agenda they will use other means</text>
  <text start="508.509" dur="4.89">to bring us in that direction a very</text>
  <text start="511.449" dur="6.181">something very interesting is that on</text>
  <text start="513.399" dur="6.211">James Kersey on his Twitter feed I saw</text>
  <text start="517.63" dur="5.039">something very interesting says where it</text>
  <text start="519.61" dur="6.57">says why exactly is it that we have the</text>
  <text start="522.669" dur="6.66">Fed why can&amp;#39;t the government you know</text>
  <text start="526.18" dur="7.529">print silver certificates or Treasury</text>
  <text start="529.329" dur="8.161">bills or create our own type of currency</text>
  <text start="533.709" dur="7.5">without the central bank and again this</text>
  <text start="537.49" dur="7.529">goes back to my original report and my</text>
  <text start="541.209" dur="6.211">original theory of this is why Trump has</text>
  <text start="545.019" dur="4.56">Andrew Jackson hanging on the wall in</text>
  <text start="547.42" dur="3.9">the White House was Andrew Jackson he</text>
  <text start="549.579" dur="4.801">campaigned on getting rid of the central</text>
  <text start="551.32" dur="5.579">bank and I believe this is the move to</text>
  <text start="554.38" dur="4.44">get rid of the central bank this is what</text>
  <text start="556.899" dur="3.841">the whole transition is about this is</text>
  <text start="558.82" dur="4.59">the whole this is the whole idea behind</text>
  <text start="560.74" dur="4.469">all of this because the central bank is</text>
  <text start="563.41" dur="3.9">the root of all evil they&amp;#39;re the ones</text>
  <text start="565.209" dur="4.32">who create the currency they&amp;#39;re the ones</text>
  <text start="567.31" dur="5.31">who bribe government officials blackmail</text>
  <text start="569.529" dur="4.951">they push their agenda across the globe</text>
  <text start="572.62" dur="3.839">they create wars they do all of this</text>
  <text start="574.48" dur="3.539">stuff to make sure that they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="576.459" dur="4.291">control and it&amp;#39;s very interesting that</text>
  <text start="578.019" dur="5.251">he is out there saying this just like I</text>
  <text start="580.75" dur="5.579">am saying this that this is the main</text>
  <text start="583.27" dur="4.23">focus is to get rid of the central</text>
  <text start="586.329" dur="2.851">banking system if you</text>
  <text start="587.5" dur="3.27">rid of the central banking system you</text>
  <text start="589.18" dur="2.91">then get rid of the deep state and you</text>
  <text start="590.77" dur="2.4">get rid of a lot of the corruption I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="592.09" dur="5.25">not saying it all goes away</text>
  <text start="593.17" dur="6.41">but a lot of it is removed and this is</text>
  <text start="597.34" dur="5.46">the problem that we&amp;#39;ve been having since</text>
  <text start="599.58" dur="5.92">1913 and even before that when the</text>
  <text start="602.8" dur="4.26">central bank was in existence because we</text>
  <text start="605.5" dur="3.72">had the first central bank that we had</text>
  <text start="607.06" dur="3.48">the second central bank then it was gone</text>
  <text start="609.22" dur="3.24">for quite a while then we had the</text>
  <text start="610.54" dur="5.25">Federal Reserve and we see right now</text>
  <text start="612.46" dur="6.36">that they create all these problems they</text>
  <text start="615.79" dur="6.45">create debt they create poverty they</text>
  <text start="618.82" dur="6.75">create austerity they make governments</text>
  <text start="622.24" dur="6.53">bow to them the people bow to them they</text>
  <text start="625.57" dur="9.23">put people into debt the whole system is</text>
  <text start="628.77" dur="9.85">based around their system debt debt debt</text>
  <text start="634.8" dur="6.25">and you can continually work as hard as</text>
  <text start="638.62" dur="5.16">you possibly can but in the end you</text>
  <text start="641.05" dur="4.89">always end up with less and there are</text>
  <text start="643.78" dur="4.08">some people that yes will make out and</text>
  <text start="645.94" dur="3.75">are there&amp;#39;s the majority of the people</text>
  <text start="647.86" dur="5.43">that will not and that&amp;#39;s how their</text>
  <text start="649.69" dur="5.4">system is created where the majority of</text>
  <text start="653.29" dur="3.66">the people well they have a tough time</text>
  <text start="655.09" dur="4.53">they live paycheck to paycheck they</text>
  <text start="656.95" dur="4.47">really can&amp;#39;t save that much and they are</text>
  <text start="659.62" dur="4.17">struggling every single day this is this</text>
  <text start="661.42" dur="4.53">is why people needed needed credit cards</text>
  <text start="663.79" dur="3.54">because you need to live on credit</text>
  <text start="665.95" dur="3.6">because the value of the dollar</text>
  <text start="667.33" dur="5.16">decreased so rapidly that nobody can</text>
  <text start="669.55" dur="5.55">survive if everyone in the u.s. got rid</text>
  <text start="672.49" dur="5.55">of all the credit cards and you lived on</text>
  <text start="675.1" dur="5.28">the amount of currency that you were</text>
  <text start="678.04" dur="4.71">receiving most of the people would not</text>
  <text start="680.38" dur="4.83">be able to live today they would not be</text>
  <text start="682.75" dur="5.64">able to survive so what they&amp;#39;ve done is</text>
  <text start="685.21" dur="5.16">they created a way where you can still</text>
  <text start="688.39" dur="5.01">live and you still think things are fine</text>
  <text start="690.37" dur="4.74">but your debt levels have increased</text>
  <text start="693.4" dur="3.51">dramatically you&amp;#39;re always making</text>
  <text start="695.11" dur="3.36">payments to the credit cards the</text>
  <text start="696.91" dur="3.9">interest rates on the credit cards are</text>
  <text start="698.47" dur="4.95">very very high and this whole thing was</text>
  <text start="700.81" dur="5.79">designed that way and when you pay</text>
  <text start="703.42" dur="5.7">something down guess what you have to</text>
  <text start="706.6" dur="4.74">borrow against the credit cards once</text>
  <text start="709.12" dur="4.53">again just to survive and as the system</text>
  <text start="711.34" dur="3.69">breaks down you see more and more people</text>
  <text start="713.65" dur="3.12">using the credit cards and this is</text>
  <text start="715.03" dur="4.65">exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="716.77" dur="3.92">savings continually drop and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="719.68" dur="4.51">seeing the</text>
  <text start="720.69" dur="5.7">to card usage continually increasing and</text>
  <text start="724.19" dur="4.39">we see as more and more people get</text>
  <text start="726.39" dur="3.45">low-paying jobs more people more and</text>
  <text start="728.58" dur="3.45">more people aren&amp;#39;t getting the cost of</text>
  <text start="729.84" dur="4.53">living it makes it very very tough and</text>
  <text start="732.03" dur="4.5">this is why this system can&amp;#39;t really go</text>
  <text start="734.37" dur="4.47">on any further this is why you have you</text>
  <text start="736.53" dur="4.38">know that 10% of the people that have a</text>
  <text start="738.84" dur="6.39">lot of the wealth and 1% have a lot of</text>
  <text start="740.91" dur="6.6">the wealth and think about it 90% just</text>
  <text start="745.23" dur="4.68">breaking even and the rest struggling</text>
  <text start="747.51" dur="5.31">just to get by every single day and they</text>
  <text start="749.91" dur="5.43">need government assistance the system</text>
  <text start="752.82" dur="6.29">was designed to make sure that everyone</text>
  <text start="755.34" dur="8.04">was always working for the central bank</text>
  <text start="759.11" dur="7.35">not working to better yourself not</text>
  <text start="763.38" dur="6.33">working there you&amp;#39;re always working to</text>
  <text start="766.46" dur="5.08">supply the interest payments to the</text>
  <text start="769.71" dur="4.29">central bank as the government</text>
  <text start="771.54" dur="5.19">continually borrows and the whole thing</text>
  <text start="774" dur="4.56">is one gigantic Ponzi scheme even though</text>
  <text start="776.73" dur="3.6">they call the crypto currency market the</text>
  <text start="778.56" dur="3.99">Ponzi scheme it&amp;#39;s actually their system</text>
  <text start="780.33" dur="4.29">that is the Ponzi scheme they create</text>
  <text start="782.55" dur="4.02">bubbles they have a Ponzi scheme they</text>
  <text start="784.62" dur="3.6">enslave the people to work as hard as</text>
  <text start="786.57" dur="3.78">they possibly can and when they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="788.22" dur="3.6">work anymore they go into debt and when</text>
  <text start="790.35" dur="3.69">they go into debt they have to declare</text>
  <text start="791.82" dur="4.02">bankruptcy or they have other problems</text>
  <text start="794.04" dur="3.6">people have a very difficult time</text>
  <text start="795.84" dur="3.3">finding jobs and the whole thing has</text>
  <text start="797.64" dur="3.33">been set up this way look at the</text>
  <text start="799.14" dur="4.35">countries like in Greece and Cyprus and</text>
  <text start="800.97" dur="4.35">in France and many others they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="803.49" dur="3.3">having the same problem this is why here</text>
  <text start="805.32" dur="3.39">in the US we needed all these</text>
  <text start="806.79" dur="4.49">entitlement programs because the</text>
  <text start="808.71" dur="5.85">majority of the people they can&amp;#39;t live</text>
  <text start="811.28" dur="5.32">yes if you have credit cards you can get</text>
  <text start="814.56" dur="4.35">by if you&amp;#39;re getting entitlements from</text>
  <text start="816.6" dur="5.73">the government you can get by but if you</text>
  <text start="818.91" dur="6.57">try to live on your salary you had a</text>
  <text start="822.33" dur="5.31">family many of the people would have a</text>
  <text start="825.48" dur="4.23">very tough time doing this with having</text>
  <text start="827.64" dur="5.49">no credit cards whatsoever and when I</text>
  <text start="829.71" dur="6.84">say living on your salary no car</text>
  <text start="833.13" dur="6.72">payments no credit cards nothing that</text>
  <text start="836.55" dur="6.42">has to do with debt it&amp;#39;s very difficult</text>
  <text start="839.85" dur="5.4">for every single person to live that way</text>
  <text start="842.97" dur="3.54">yes you&amp;#39;re gonna have a few people that</text>
  <text start="845.25" dur="5.12">will be able to do especially those</text>
  <text start="846.51" dur="6.3">individuals that grew up who were</text>
  <text start="850.37" dur="4.209">younger in the 70s where they were</text>
  <text start="852.81" dur="2.699">already working they built their wealth</text>
  <text start="854.579" dur="3.87">because that was the beginning of the</text>
  <text start="855.509" dur="6.211">system those people who are coming into</text>
  <text start="858.449" dur="6.57">the system in the late 90s in the 2000s</text>
  <text start="861.72" dur="5.64">guess what very difficult time to making</text>
  <text start="865.019" dur="4.5">or trying to make ends meet without the</text>
  <text start="867.36" dur="4.11">credit cards without the payments</text>
  <text start="869.519" dur="5.55">without the monthly payments for</text>
  <text start="871.47" dur="6.239">everything that you do today try it one</text>
  <text start="875.069" dur="4.38">time try living on just your salary get</text>
  <text start="877.709" dur="4.831">rid of the credit cards get rid of all</text>
  <text start="879.449" dur="5.31">that stuff and try to live day by day</text>
  <text start="882.54" dur="4.5">living on that most of the people cannot</text>
  <text start="884.759" dur="5.43">do it today that&amp;#39;s because the dollar</text>
  <text start="887.04" dur="5.25">the value of the dollar has decreased so</text>
  <text start="890.189" dur="5.07">quickly today that it takes a lot more</text>
  <text start="892.29" dur="6.06">dollars to get the same exact loaf of</text>
  <text start="895.259" dur="6.27">bread to get the same gallon of milk to</text>
  <text start="898.35" dur="6.289">get the same of everything it&amp;#39;s not that</text>
  <text start="901.529" dur="5.67">things are going up it&amp;#39;s the dollar is</text>
  <text start="904.639" dur="4.63">declining rapidly and you need a lot</text>
  <text start="907.199" dur="5.521">more of them to get the same exact</text>
  <text start="909.269" dur="5.85">things actually the process of creating</text>
  <text start="912.72" dur="5.609">and manufacturing well that&amp;#39;s gotten</text>
  <text start="915.119" dur="6.57">less expensive and there are processes</text>
  <text start="918.329" dur="6.031">that that can create these objects very</text>
  <text start="921.689" dur="6.63">easily today but the problem is is that</text>
  <text start="924.36" dur="6.719">the dollar has lost its value and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="928.319" dur="4.95">why people struggle today this is why</text>
  <text start="931.079" dur="3.99">people need to live on credit this is</text>
  <text start="933.269" dur="4.56">why they this is why they talk about</text>
  <text start="935.069" dur="3.99">credit scores I mean without the central</text>
  <text start="937.829" dur="2.73">banks there&amp;#39;s no such thing as credit</text>
  <text start="939.059" dur="3.36">scores you don&amp;#39;t need it because you</text>
  <text start="940.559" dur="4.44">would be able to live on the currency</text>
  <text start="942.419" dur="4.17">every single day but since we have this</text>
  <text start="944.999" dur="2.911">interest attached it makes it very</text>
  <text start="946.589" dur="3.09">difficult so what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="947.91" dur="5.88">is we&amp;#39;re having this major transition</text>
  <text start="949.679" dur="6.09">and what&amp;#39;s going on is we&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="953.79" dur="5.579">move from the central banking system</text>
  <text start="955.769" dur="5.49">that has enslaved us to a system where</text>
  <text start="959.369" dur="3.63">it really supports the people where</text>
  <text start="961.259" dur="5.43">there&amp;#39;s no interest attached where the</text>
  <text start="962.999" dur="5.88">currency doesn&amp;#39;t lose its value and it</text>
  <text start="966.689" dur="3.93">doesn&amp;#39;t do the same thing as the central</text>
  <text start="968.879" dur="3.27">banking system so we&amp;#39;re going to go</text>
  <text start="970.619" dur="3.39">through this transition and you need to</text>
  <text start="972.149" dur="3.72">be ready and prepared and you need to</text>
  <text start="974.009" dur="3.12">make sure that you have everything in</text>
  <text start="975.869" dur="2.13">line make sure you have food and water</text>
  <text start="977.129" dur="2.221">because we&amp;#39;re going to see inflation</text>
  <text start="977.999" dur="3.12">which means the dollars going to lose</text>
  <text start="979.35" dur="3.479">value you&amp;#39;re going to need gold and</text>
  <text start="981.119" dur="3.75">silver to maintain your wealth you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="982.829" dur="3.45">need some cryptocurrency because it</text>
  <text start="984.869" dur="2.871">looks like we&amp;#39;re going to be making that</text>
  <text start="986.279" dur="3.621">push to end</text>
  <text start="987.74" dur="3.48">that tried that type of system the</text>
  <text start="989.9" dur="3.72">central bankers again are going to try</text>
  <text start="991.22" dur="3.57">to move us into a different system but</text>
  <text start="993.62" dur="2.91">we could see right now we&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="994.79" dur="3.54">through a transition no matter what so</text>
