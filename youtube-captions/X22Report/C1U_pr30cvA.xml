  <text start="83" dur="4.02">and we know how the United States places</text>
  <text start="85.19" dur="4.709">games because we know the elections here</text>
  <text start="87.02" dur="5.58">in the United States they are crooked we</text>
  <text start="89.899" dur="5.041">know that they rigged the ballots we</text>
  <text start="92.6" dur="5.46">know that they continually manipulate</text>
  <text start="94.94" dur="8.429">the information and out in Venezuela</text>
  <text start="98.06" dur="8.309">each person needs to be fingerprinted to</text>

  <text start="106.369" dur="5.971">it much more difficult to cheat the</text>
  <text start="110.63" dur="5.989">system they&amp;#39;re trying to authenticate</text>
  <text start="112.34" dur="7.639">the signatures to make sure that</text>
  <text start="116.619" dur="5.531">everyone is who they say they are and</text>

  <text start="135.56" dur="5.399">well it is like a time bomb ready to</text>
  <text start="138.98" dur="3.69">explode here and we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="140.959" dur="3.78">watch the situation very very carefully</text>
  <text start="142.67" dur="4.409">here in the United States what are we</text>
  <text start="144.739" dur="4.741">seeing well we know we had that Orlando</text>
  <text start="147.079" dur="4.981">shooting which was a complete false flag</text>
  <text start="149.48" dur="3.78">and we know this was part of many</text>
  <text start="152.06" dur="4.44">different agendas and one of them was</text>
  <text start="153.26" dur="6.18">gun control now we see right now that</text>
  <text start="156.5" dur="6.06">the Supreme Court turned away two</text>
  <text start="159.44" dur="4.35">separate appeals challenging the assault</text>
  <text start="162.56" dur="1.89">weapons ban in New York which we</text>
  <text start="163.79" dur="4.02">mentioned yes</text>
  <text start="164.45" dur="6.21">and Connecticut the Senate rejected for</text>
  <text start="167.81" dur="6.27">total proposals centered around gun</text>
  <text start="170.66" dur="5.4">control now the Senate couldn&amp;#39;t agree on</text>
  <text start="174.08" dur="3.42">two proposals to block suspected</text>
  <text start="176.06" dur="4.17">terrorists from being able to buy a gun</text>
  <text start="177.5" dur="6.81">nor could the Senate agree on two gun</text>
  <text start="180.23" dur="5.88">background check proposals all other</text>
  <text start="184.31" dur="3.509">proposals would have been an amendment</text>
  <text start="186.11" dur="4.739">to the commerce justice and science</text>
  <text start="187.819" dur="7.17">appropriations bill but it didn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="190.849" dur="6.991">through when we look at this we see</text>
  <text start="194.989" dur="7.921">they&amp;#39;re trying to throw as many of these</text>
  <text start="197.84" dur="8.82">type of gun proposals all at once we see</text>
  <text start="202.91" dur="5.04">that Dianne Feinstein&amp;#39;s amendment which</text>
  <text start="206.66" dur="3.21">would have allowed the Attorney General</text>
  <text start="207.95" dur="6.75">to block the sale of a gun or explosive</text>
  <text start="209.87" dur="6.57">there was a reason of an individual but</text>
  <text start="214.7" dur="3.06">that didn&amp;#39;t get through not just because</text>
  <text start="216.44" dur="3">you have a suspicion doesn&amp;#39;t mean that</text>
  <text start="217.76" dur="3.479">you&amp;#39;re guilty and that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that</text>
  <text start="219.44" dur="3.24">you should have anything taken away from</text>
  <text start="221.239" dur="5.461">you there was no due process there was</text>
  <text start="222.68" dur="5.91">nothing but the one that I&amp;#39;m worried</text>
  <text start="226.7" dur="6">about the one that we all should be</text>
  <text start="228.59" dur="7.47">worried about is the no-fly no x and we</text>
  <text start="232.7" dur="5.159">see right now Susan Collins she&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="236.06" dur="5.519">to introduce another version of the</text>
  <text start="237.859" dur="6.321">no-fly no by legislation and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="241.579" dur="7.981">hoping that this will win passage</text>
  <text start="244.18" dur="9.04">through a compromise now Susan Collins</text>
  <text start="249.56" dur="7.44">proposal would be would ban sales of</text>
  <text start="253.22" dur="5.389">guns to terrorism suspects who appear on</text>
  <text start="257" dur="3.78">either the government&amp;#39;s no-fly list</text>
  <text start="258.609" dur="3.701">which prevents certain travelers from</text>
  <text start="260.78" dur="7.68">boarding commercial flights as we know</text>
  <text start="262.31" dur="7.829">and we can see that there was no due</text>
  <text start="268.46" dur="5.82">process you don&amp;#39;t know how you get on</text>
  <text start="270.139" dur="6.541">the list anybody can be put on the list</text>
  <text start="274.28" dur="6.6">and you don&amp;#39;t know how to get off the</text>
  <text start="276.68" dur="7.08">list federal authorities would also be</text>
  <text start="280.88" dur="4.5">notified of any gun purchases by anyone</text>
  <text start="283.76" dur="3.99">on the government&amp;#39;s terror watch list</text>
  <text start="285.38" dur="4.349">over the prior five years allowing the</text>
  <text start="287.75" dur="4.53">FBI to put the person under surveillance</text>
  <text start="289.729" dur="5.401">now they haven&amp;#39;t done anything but now</text>
  <text start="292.28" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re under surveillance this is a</text>
  <text start="295.13" dur="2.879">violation of everyone&amp;#39;s constitutional</text>
  <text start="296.96" dur="4.409">right</text>
  <text start="298.009" dur="7.11">being flagged watched for a suspicion</text>
  <text start="301.369" dur="7.681">that&amp;#39;s absolutely not proven there&amp;#39;s no</text>

  <text start="309.05" dur="4.56">any type of legal justification of why</text>
  <text start="311.899" dur="6.98">they&amp;#39;re depriving any one of their</text>
  <text start="313.61" dur="8.13">rights this is completely a violation of</text>
  <text start="318.879" dur="7.6">your rights my rights your rights</text>
  <text start="321.74" dur="9.75">everyone&amp;#39;s rights and we can see right</text>
  <text start="326.479" dur="6.93">now is that to deny the right to due</text>
  <text start="331.49" dur="5.13">process or the right to purchase a</text>
  <text start="333.409" dur="5.37">firearm flying in the face of the fifth</text>
  <text start="336.62" dur="6.799">and the Second Amendment is extremely</text>
  <text start="338.779" dur="7.56">unconstitutional and very dangerous and</text>
  <text start="343.419" dur="6.64">this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="346.339" dur="6.031">forward Michael Boldon said the founders</text>
  <text start="350.059" dur="4.41">were well aware of this simple wisdom it</text>
  <text start="352.37" dur="4.969">was a major driver and the attempt to</text>
  <text start="354.469" dur="5.01">set up a government that was open</text>
  <text start="357.339" dur="4.03">accountable and most of all forced to</text>
  <text start="359.479" dur="4.47">respect the liberty of its people by</text>

  <text start="363.949" dur="4.74">arbitrary laws and secretive charges he</text>
  <text start="366.439" dur="5.25">also said governing and policing by</text>
  <text start="368.689" dur="6.84">secret lists will only produce secret</text>
  <text start="371.689" dur="5.641">government and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="375.529" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;re seeing we are not seeing</text>

  <text start="385.459" dur="8.25">their rulers may be concealed from them</text>
  <text start="389.499" dur="6.63">we see where we are headed right now the</text>
  <text start="393.709" dur="8.281">government is pushing their agenda and</text>
  <text start="396.129" dur="9.701">this one law which will allow the FBI</text>

  <text start="422.689" dur="5.73">going after the gun manufacturers this</text>
  <text start="426.529" dur="4.021">is how they&amp;#39;re trying to get around all</text>
  <text start="428.419" dur="4.231">of this now this is repugnant</text>
  <text start="430.55" dur="5.79">to the Second Amendment and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="432.65" dur="7.44">violation and they can&amp;#39;t write a law</text>
  <text start="436.34" dur="4.86">that supersedes the rights of the people</text>
  <text start="440.09" dur="4.26">but this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="441.2" dur="4.71">convince everyone of and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="444.35" dur="3.15">trying to do right now is trying to</text>
  <text start="445.91" dur="5.07">convince everyone well if we do this we</text>
  <text start="447.5" dur="6.15">have the right to do this and you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="450.98" dur="4.86">question it because we don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="453.65" dur="7.95">give you any information this is a</text>
  <text start="455.84" dur="8.97">government in secrecy you are not proven</text>
  <text start="461.6" dur="6.63">in a court of law by a jury of your</text>
  <text start="464.81" dur="7.65">peers of any type of crime by any type</text>
  <text start="468.23" dur="8.64">of actually anything and we should all</text>
  <text start="472.46" dur="8.13">be aware of this now they said they</text>
  <text start="476.87" dur="6.87">found the two black boxes to Egypt air</text>
  <text start="480.59" dur="6.81">flight 804 but they&amp;#39;re saying the black</text>
  <text start="483.74" dur="6.57">boxes they are damaged there is crucial</text>
  <text start="487.4" dur="6.51">memory chip damage to both units not</text>
  <text start="490.31" dur="4.83">just one and very interestingly when we</text>
  <text start="493.91" dur="4.5">look at the black box which is not</text>
  <text start="495.14" dur="6.06">blacken at all it&amp;#39;s orange to protect</text>
  <text start="498.41" dur="4.83">the stack memory boards let&amp;#39;s store the</text>
  <text start="501.2" dur="3.69">information these black boxes are</text>
  <text start="503.24" dur="3.86">wrapped in a thin layer of aluminum and</text>
  <text start="504.89" dur="5.96">a one inch layer of high-temperature</text>

  <text start="514.64" dur="6.09">stainless steel or take tight or</text>
  <text start="517.01" dur="5.48">titanium shell the black box must be</text>
  <text start="520.73" dur="5.55">able to withstand an acceleration of</text>
  <text start="522.49" dur="6.7">3400 GS thirty-four hundred times the</text>

  <text start="529.19" dur="6.33">velocity of about 310 miles per hour it</text>
  <text start="531.74" dur="7.32">must also survive flames up to 2,000</text>
  <text start="535.52" dur="5.46">degrees for one hour and the beacon</text>
  <text start="539.06" dur="4.86">should be able to emit a signal once per</text>
  <text start="540.98" dur="7.59">second while submersed in 20,000 feet of</text>
  <text start="543.92" dur="6.75">salt water for 30 days and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="548.57" dur="7.04">trying to say both of these boxes are</text>
  <text start="550.67" dur="8.52">damaged kind of hard to believe or</text>
  <text start="555.61" dur="5.95">they&amp;#39;re using this as an excuse so they</text>
  <text start="559.19" dur="3.389">don&amp;#39;t have to put out what really</text>
  <text start="561.56" dur="2.629">happened</text>
  <text start="562.579" dur="4.67">and most of the people and myself</text>
  <text start="564.189" dur="5.95">believe during this time of this flight</text>
  <text start="567.249" dur="7.361">it was a u.s. is really drilled going on</text>
  <text start="570.139" dur="8.581">and most likely this plane was shot down</text>
  <text start="574.61" dur="8">now out in Ukraine we see that Kiev</text>
  <text start="578.72" dur="6.57">poroshenko they are never going to</text>
  <text start="582.61" dur="5.889">complete the Mint&amp;#39;s to cease fire they</text>
  <text start="585.29" dur="5.25">made this very clear and we see that us</text>

  <text start="593.36" dur="7.579">traveling to Ukraine on jun 21st to</text>
  <text start="597.23" dur="7.68">discuss the crisis in Ukraine&amp;#39;s East and</text>
  <text start="600.939" dur="8.77">we see right now that something might</text>
  <text start="604.91" dur="6.779">occur every time she visits Kiev we know</text>
  <text start="609.709" dur="4.11">that something happens we know she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="611.689" dur="5.12">also going to maybe make a trip to</text>
  <text start="613.819" dur="5.341">Moscow to talk about the crisis and</text>
  <text start="616.809" dur="4.12">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to watch the situation</text>
  <text start="619.16" dur="4.289">very carefully because if it does not go</text>
  <text start="620.929" dur="7.02">her way we know that something is going</text>
  <text start="623.449" dur="6.3">to occur now out in Eastern Europe we</text>
  <text start="627.949" dur="3.841">see the US has plenty to deploy about</text>
  <text start="629.749" dur="4.83">5,000 soldiers to strengthen NATO&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="631.79" dur="5.43">eastern flank and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="634.579" dur="5.04">u.s. is continually bringing in more and</text>
  <text start="637.22" dur="4.799">more military assets into Eastern Europe</text>

  <text start="655.339" dur="7.021">assets military troops and this has not</text>
  <text start="657.829" dur="8.22">slowed for the last four to five years</text>
  <text start="662.36" dur="5.849">it has actually accelerated and just in</text>
  <text start="666.049" dur="5.25">the last two years it has accelerated</text>
  <text start="668.209" dur="4.74">quite a bit because what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="671.299" dur="3.57">is they&amp;#39;re trying to provoke these</text>
  <text start="672.949" dur="3.151">countries what they&amp;#39;re doing is that</text>

  <text start="774.589" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re going to meet in Brussels but it</text>
  <text start="778.22" dur="4.64">looks like right now that they&amp;#39;re going</text>

  <text start="837.86" dur="5.719">the same exact time because we can see</text>
  <text start="841.16" dur="5.429">there&amp;#39;s one system on the rise and</text>
  <text start="843.579" dur="6.281">there&amp;#39;s one system that is dying and</text>

  <text start="849.86" dur="7.589">war to cover up what they&amp;#39;ve done we see</text>
  <text start="854.51" dur="5.639">out in Iraq the Iraqi forces are saying</text>
  <text start="857.449" dur="4.531">that they want Fallujah back the US and</text>
  <text start="860.149" dur="4.321">the coalition forces are saying well</text>

  <text start="864.47" dur="4.44">haven&amp;#39;t really gotten the entire thing</text>
  <text start="866.32" dur="4.629">but the Iraqi forces they push into the</text>
  <text start="868.91" dur="3.72">center of Fallujah and it looks like</text>
  <text start="870.949" dur="2.851">they&amp;#39;re be taking their country and of</text>
  <text start="872.63" dur="3.78">course the United States doesn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="873.8" dur="4.38">this to happen they want the chaos they</text>
  <text start="876.41" dur="3.299">want the government to look like they</text>
  <text start="878.18" dur="3.69">don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re doing the forces</text>

  <text start="881.87" dur="6.959">United States which is the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="884.62" dur="6.73">because in the end of all this what they</text>
  <text start="888.829" dur="4.351">really want to do is they want to make</text>
  <text start="891.35" dur="4.95">their case of how they&amp;#39;re going to break</text>
  <text start="893.18" dur="6.019">up all these countries into Sunni into</text>
  <text start="896.3" dur="5.13">Shiite into curds into ala whites and</text>

  <text start="914.449" dur="4.5">Iraq is in deep trouble it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="916.55" dur="4.83">dysfunctional and they&amp;#39;re painting this</text>

  <text start="921.38" dur="2.939">happen is we&amp;#39;re going to have to break</text>
  <text start="922.399" dur="4.471">them up now what&amp;#39;s really happening in</text>
  <text start="924.319" dur="6.091">all these countries in Libya in Yemen in</text>
  <text start="926.87" dur="5.25">Lebanon and Iraq the people of the</text>

  <text start="934.31" dur="5.399">fighting back the US government central</text>
  <text start="937.25" dur="5.61">bankers cannot let this happen this is</text>
  <text start="939.709" dur="6.451">why the US government is choosing the</text>
  <text start="942.86" dur="6.36">government&amp;#39;s for these countries look at</text>
  <text start="946.16" dur="6.299">Libya the people had no say in Yemen the</text>
  <text start="949.22" dur="6.66">people are out there voicing their</text>
  <text start="952.459" dur="5.49">concerns voicing who they want as their</text>
  <text start="955.88" dur="5.04">elected leader and the United States is</text>
  <text start="957.949" dur="5.58">saying absolutely not this is happening</text>
  <text start="960.92" dur="6.979">in Lebanon this is happening in Iraq</text>
  <text start="963.529" dur="6.54">in Syria the people have voted for</text>
  <text start="967.899" dur="5.74">Assads party the people are going to</text>
  <text start="970.069" dur="6.031">vote most likely maybe this August maybe</text>
  <text start="973.639" dur="5.161">next year whenever they do it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="976.1" dur="5.969">going to vote for Assad now the US</text>
  <text start="978.8" dur="6.75">government they don&amp;#39;t want this how dare</text>
  <text start="982.069" dur="4.351">the people vote for who they want I mean</text>
  <text start="985.55" dur="3.18">it&amp;#39;s the same thing that&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="986.42" dur="4.8">here in the United States do you think</text>
  <text start="988.73" dur="6.979">the people are really voting for their</text>
  <text start="991.22" dur="8.909">leader no the leaders are pushed on us</text>
  <text start="995.709" dur="10.081">they&amp;#39;re chosen for us the election is an</text>
  <text start="1000.129" dur="8.911">illusion it&amp;#39;s completely manipulated and</text>
  <text start="1005.79" dur="7.899">whoever they get in there if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1009.04" dur="8.37">follow what they want they will be</text>
  <text start="1013.689" dur="5.491">removed because as we know there are</text>
  <text start="1017.41" dur="7.08">other entities that are actually</text>
  <text start="1019.18" dur="8.85">controlling the US government and we can</text>
  <text start="1024.49" dur="6.15">see right now as we look closer and</text>
  <text start="1028.03" dur="5.549">closer at all the evidence at all the</text>
  <text start="1030.64" dur="4.35">indicators we see that things are</text>
  <text start="1033.579" dur="6.301">starting to really deteriorate</text>
  <text start="1034.99" dur="7.73">accelerate and central bankers the US</text>
  <text start="1039.88" dur="5.85">government the neocons they realize that</text>
  <text start="1042.72" dur="6.64">they need this war they need some type</text>
  <text start="1045.73" dur="6.809">of an event and we&amp;#39;re hearing that out</text>
  <text start="1049.36" dur="5.88">in California they&amp;#39;re preparing for this</text>
  <text start="1052.539" dur="7.201">power grid emergency where customers</text>
  <text start="1055.24" dur="6.96">could expect 14 days without power now</text>
  <text start="1059.74" dur="4.2">they might not be consecutive they might</text>
  <text start="1062.2" dur="4.08">be like two or three days maybe one day</text>
  <text start="1063.94" dur="3.84">here one day there but it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1066.28" dur="3.84">interesting that the power grid and of</text>
  <text start="1067.78" dur="4.29">course we&amp;#39;re saying this unceasingly hot</text>
  <text start="1070.12" dur="3.419">and humid weather we don&amp;#39;t know if this</text>
  <text start="1072.07" dur="5.16">power grid would be able to support</text>
  <text start="1073.539" dur="6.151">what&amp;#39;s going on here and they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="1077.23" dur="5.699">all customers including people in homes</text>
  <text start="1079.69" dur="4.95">hospitals oil refineries airports that</text>
  <text start="1082.929" dur="4.261">they&amp;#39;re at risk of losing power this</text>
  <text start="1084.64" dur="5.759">summer and let&amp;#39;s just take this at face</text>
  <text start="1087.19" dur="5.43">value let&amp;#39;s say okay there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="1090.399" dur="5.311">a lot of power consumption the power</text>
  <text start="1092.62" dur="4.439">grid might go down here we are again in</text>
  <text start="1095.71" dur="3.809">a situation where</text>
  <text start="1097.059" dur="3.901">people need to be prepared remember when</text>
  <text start="1099.519" dur="3.331">the power goes down refrigeration</text>
  <text start="1100.96" dur="6.839">doesn&amp;#39;t work you don&amp;#39;t have lights you</text>
  <text start="1102.85" dur="7.529">don&amp;#39;t have the things that you need food</text>
  <text start="1107.799" dur="4.311">is going to go bad and again here&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1110.379" dur="3.66">situation where you need to be prepared</text>
  <text start="1112.11" dur="6.149">now let&amp;#39;s take this a step further</text>
  <text start="1114.039" dur="8.421">because we know a couple years ago when</text>
  <text start="1118.259" dur="8.831">Janet Napolitano was the DHS secretary</text>
  <text start="1122.46" dur="7.089">she warned of an attack on the power</text>
  <text start="1127.09" dur="4.529">grid that not if but when it happens</text>
  <text start="1129.549" dur="4.35">because they already know they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1131.619" dur="5.39">to do it they&amp;#39;ve been drilling for this</text>
  <text start="1133.899" dur="6">with the grid x2 with multiple agencies</text>
  <text start="1137.009" dur="4.75">because they were expecting some type of</text>
  <text start="1139.899" dur="6.6">cyber attack to bring the power grid</text>
  <text start="1141.759" dur="8.91">down and we see right now that they were</text>
  <text start="1146.499" dur="7.441">prepared for this actually they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1150.669" dur="6.51">talking about a cyber attack on the</text>
  <text start="1153.94" dur="7.949">power infrastructure for quite a while</text>
  <text start="1157.179" dur="10.82">they&amp;#39;re talking about a cyber Pearl</text>
  <text start="1161.889" dur="9.39">Harbor a virtual 911 and we can see this</text>
  <text start="1167.999" dur="7.241">would be an event where power would go</text>
  <text start="1171.279" dur="8.541">out water would stop working deliveries</text>
  <text start="1175.24" dur="7.23">would stop and you would have to be on</text>
  <text start="1179.82" dur="5.049">your own at this point it&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="1182.47" dur="6.419">because the president just a couple days</text>
  <text start="1184.869" dur="5.43">ago maybe a week ago came out and said</text>
  <text start="1188.889" dur="3.24">that everyone should be prepared that</text>
  <text start="1190.299" dur="4.671">the government will not be able to</text>
  <text start="1192.129" dur="7.62">assist every single person during a</text>
  <text start="1194.97" dur="8.47">statewide emergency hmm are they</text>
  <text start="1199.749" dur="7.38">preparing the American people in some</text>
  <text start="1203.44" dur="5.459">way by feeding us tidbits of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1207.129" dur="4.711">about to happen because they love to do</text>
  <text start="1208.899" dur="6.841">this now something even more interesting</text>
  <text start="1211.84" dur="7.289">is that the US Department of Homeland</text>
  <text start="1215.74" dur="5.759">Security they&amp;#39;ve ordered rad seekers</text>
  <text start="1219.129" dur="5.79">which are handheld radiation detectors</text>
  <text start="1221.499" dur="7.111">and identifier identifiers and they they</text>
  <text start="1224.919" dur="6.151">purchased these through smiths detection</text>
  <text start="1228.61" dur="7.11">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this</text>
  <text start="1231.07" dur="6.45">is that the rat seeker order comes under</text>
  <text start="1235.72" dur="6.63">an indefinite delivery indefinite</text>
  <text start="1237.52" dur="7.23">quantity contract which is worth 409</text>
  <text start="1242.35" dur="3.78">million dollars the details of the</text>
  <text start="1244.75" dur="5.13">number of units ordered and delivery</text>
  <text start="1246.13" dur="6.03">schedule they&amp;#39;re not really disclosed so</text>
  <text start="1249.88" dur="6.03">we have a power grid failure we have</text>
  <text start="1252.16" dur="6.03">more of these radiation detectors and we</text>
  <text start="1255.91" dur="6.41">know what eventually is going to happen</text>
  <text start="1258.19" dur="8.01">here because as this collapse scenario</text>
  <text start="1262.32" dur="8.08">takes hold they&amp;#39;re going to need an</text>
  <text start="1266.2" dur="7.349">event and we already hear from these</text>
  <text start="1270.4" dur="5.37">government employees that there could be</text>
  <text start="1273.549" dur="4.441">some type of cyber attack and if the</text>
  <text start="1275.77" dur="4.95">lights do go out there only going to go</text>
  <text start="1277.99" dur="4.71">out in certain cities i believe back in</text>
  <text start="1280.72" dur="3.57">2003 when they have the eastern seaboard</text>
  <text start="1282.7" dur="3.57">the power go out i believe that was a</text>
  <text start="1284.29" dur="5.34">test to see how they can bring this down</text>
  <text start="1286.27" dur="6.51">and i think they&amp;#39;re getting prepared and</text>
  <text start="1289.63" dur="6.179">ready for this they need to scare the</text>
  <text start="1292.78" dur="6.6">people into going into more and the only</text>
  <text start="1295.809" dur="6.631">way to do this is to have power outages</text>
  <text start="1299.38" dur="4.919">for a certain period of time bring down</text>
  <text start="1302.44" dur="3.9">the financial institution at the same</text>
  <text start="1304.299" dur="5.101">time of course this will be done by</text>
  <text start="1306.34" dur="6.589">cyber attacks and they need the fiscal</text>
  <text start="1309.4" dur="6.6">tax because they need that impact of</text>
  <text start="1312.929" dur="4.87">blasts going off to scare the people I</text>
  <text start="1316" dur="6">believe that this is going to happen in</text>
  <text start="1317.799" dur="6.361">multiple cities and we&amp;#39;re seeing all</text>
  <text start="1322" dur="4.89">this evidence pile up all these</text>
  <text start="1324.16" dur="6.03">indicators I should say pile up that</text>
  <text start="1326.89" dur="6.24">they&amp;#39;re getting prepared for this now do</text>
  <text start="1330.19" dur="4.92">we know the exact time frame no this is</text>
  <text start="1333.13" dur="4.02">why everyone needs to be ready and</text>
