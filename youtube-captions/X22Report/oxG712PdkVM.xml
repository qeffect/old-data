  <text start="29.68" dur="4.95">name is dave and this is episode 461 and</text>
  <text start="32.2" dur="4.44">today&amp;#39;s date is September 6 2014 and the</text>
  <text start="34.63" dur="3.48">title this episode is the current</text>
  <text start="36.64" dur="4.41">economic collapse news brief for this</text>
  <text start="38.11" dur="4.8">Saturday now we all know the economy is</text>
  <text start="41.05" dur="3.45">not what it seems we understand the</text>
  <text start="42.91" dur="3.78">government is manipulating all different</text>
  <text start="44.5" dur="4.26">calculations like inflation GDP</text>
  <text start="46.69" dur="4.639">unemployment we know the unemployment</text>
  <text start="48.76" dur="5.49">numbers came out as i reported yesterday</text>
  <text start="51.329" dur="5.41">they were completely manipulated the</text>
  <text start="54.25" dur="6.329">unemployment percentage came down point</text>
  <text start="56.739" dur="6.811">one percent just because there were more</text>
  <text start="60.579" dur="5.871">people out of the labor market this has</text>
  <text start="63.55" dur="6.12">nothing to do with how many people are</text>
  <text start="66.45" dur="5.44">employed today because there&amp;#39;s about 92</text>
  <text start="69.67" dur="4.32">million or so people that are out of the</text>
  <text start="71.89" dur="5.4">market and we have to remember how they</text>
  <text start="73.99" dur="5.61">calculate all this they calculated by</text>
  <text start="77.29" dur="4.29">those people who are continually getting</text>
  <text start="79.6" dur="4.41">interviews if you haven&amp;#39;t been on any</text>
  <text start="81.58" dur="4.8">type of interview but you&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="84.01" dur="5.07">sending out resumes you&amp;#39;re pretty much</text>
  <text start="86.38" dur="5.55">not counted they&amp;#39;re saying that you</text>
  <text start="89.08" dur="5.52">don&amp;#39;t even want a job it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="91.93" dur="4.38">whatsoever maybe there are no jobs out</text>
  <text start="94.6" dur="4.68">there but you keep trying to get that</text>
  <text start="96.31" dur="4.65">job you redo your resume to get the</text>
  <text start="99.28" dur="4.35">lower paying job because maybe you think</text>
  <text start="100.96" dur="4.949">there is nothing on the on your previous</text>
  <text start="103.63" dur="4.68">level so you bring it down a little bit</text>
  <text start="105.909" dur="3.75">and you see if there&amp;#39;s any jobs there</text>
  <text start="108.31" dur="3.96">and you keep going it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="109.659" dur="4.621">selling a house you&amp;#39;re out there you put</text>
  <text start="112.27" dur="3.48">it out there at a certain price nobody</text>
  <text start="114.28" dur="3.24">comes you lower the price you lower the</text>
  <text start="115.75" dur="4.2">price the same thing with your resume</text>
  <text start="117.52" dur="3.989">and I&amp;#39;ve been speaking to many many</text>
  <text start="119.95" dur="4.02">people who have been looking for a job</text>
  <text start="121.509" dur="4.65">that I&amp;#39;ve recently been laid off and</text>
  <text start="123.97" dur="4.049">what they&amp;#39;re saying is that every time</text>
  <text start="126.159" dur="3.99">they put their resume out really they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="128.019" dur="4.26">getting no response whatsoever so what</text>
  <text start="130.149" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re redoing their</text>
  <text start="132.279" dur="3.751">resume saying that you know they&amp;#39;ll take</text>
  <text start="134.319" dur="3.451">a lower position and</text>
  <text start="136.03" dur="4.34">more of the advanced things that they do</text>
  <text start="137.77" dur="4.89">and what they&amp;#39;ve done in the past and</text>
  <text start="140.37" dur="3.94">they&amp;#39;re trying to get even the lower</text>
  <text start="142.66" dur="3.96">paying jobs because there&amp;#39;s more of</text>
  <text start="144.31" dur="4.05">those and there are at the bracket that</text>
  <text start="146.62" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re in and they&amp;#39;re still having a</text>
  <text start="148.36" dur="5.61">very tough time and we also understand</text>
  <text start="150.85" dur="6.12">that as all these people are unemployed</text>
  <text start="153.97" dur="6.93">or underemployed we can see what is</text>
  <text start="156.97" dur="5.55">happening in the real market and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="160.9" dur="4.11">talking about the stock market I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="162.52" dur="5.76">talking about everyday life on the</text>
  <text start="165.01" dur="5.82">street where retail sales are down you</text>
  <text start="168.28" dur="4.53">see strip malls they&amp;#39;re empty stores</text>
  <text start="170.83" dur="4.02">going out of businesses going out of</text>
  <text start="172.81" dur="5.13">business they&amp;#39;re completely vacant and</text>
  <text start="174.85" dur="4.95">nothing is taking their place I mean I</text>
  <text start="177.94" dur="4.26">look around and I was driving around and</text>
  <text start="179.8" dur="4.53">I see all those places where blockbuster</text>
  <text start="182.2" dur="4.319">wore a lot of them are still empty i see</text>
  <text start="184.33" dur="5.76">staples where they closed down or JC</text>
  <text start="186.519" dur="6.121">Penney nothing is filling these areas</text>
  <text start="190.09" dur="5.52">now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is we&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="192.64" dur="5.31">these huge strip malls or places that</text>
  <text start="195.61" dur="4.71">are in malls where there&amp;#39;s empty stores</text>
  <text start="197.95" dur="4.86">and nothing&amp;#39;s taking up the slack so now</text>
  <text start="200.32" dur="5.43">we&amp;#39;re starting to see commercial real</text>
  <text start="202.81" dur="4.73">estate retail real estate starting to</text>
  <text start="205.75" dur="5.1">get hurt because they can&amp;#39;t fill this</text>
  <text start="207.54" dur="6.729">tremendous space now in the housing</text>
  <text start="210.85" dur="6.359">market we understand that most Americans</text>
  <text start="214.269" dur="4.621">pretty much were wiped out in 2008 they</text>
  <text start="217.209" dur="3.391">have bad credit they could never get</text>
  <text start="218.89" dur="3.33">back on their feet and if they did get</text>
  <text start="220.6" dur="4.08">back on their feet it wasn&amp;#39;t the same as</text>
  <text start="222.22" dur="4.049">it was in 2008 they&amp;#39;re making a little</text>
  <text start="224.68" dur="4.17">bit less money their savings has been</text>
  <text start="226.269" dur="4.291">wiped out their credit destroyed and we</text>
  <text start="228.85" dur="4.259">see that mortgage departments have been</text>
  <text start="230.56" dur="5.519">laying off people left and right and it</text>
  <text start="233.109" dur="5.16">really began last year and it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="236.079" dur="4.021">throughout this year where mortgage</text>
  <text start="238.269" dur="3.931">departments have really been shrinking</text>
  <text start="240.1" dur="4.08">their workforce because there&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="242.2" dur="4.56">basically no Americans out there taking</text>
  <text start="244.18" dur="4.92">out mortgages yes there are still places</text>
  <text start="246.76" dur="4.65">in America where real estate is still</text>
  <text start="249.1" dur="4.77">hot but you&amp;#39;re going to see after this</text>
  <text start="251.41" dur="8.31">summer it&amp;#39;s going to die off very very</text>
  <text start="253.87" dur="9.03">quickly so to help the real estate</text>
  <text start="259.72" dur="5.069">market Congress is going to blow the</text>
  <text start="262.9" dur="2.94">bubble up a little bit more and how are</text>
  <text start="264.789" dur="3.721">they going to do this well they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="265.84" dur="3.72">to introduce HR 514 a be access to</text>
  <text start="268.51" dur="3.86">affordable mortgages</text>
  <text start="269.56" dur="6">act and what this is going to do</text>
  <text start="272.37" dur="6.64">basically it&amp;#39;s going to allow Congress</text>
  <text start="275.56" dur="6.6">to exempt certain higher risk mortgages</text>
  <text start="279.01" dur="6.06">from property appraisal requirements so</text>
  <text start="282.16" dur="4.74">if the house is looking like it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="285.07" dur="4.349">really worth what it&amp;#39;s worth you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="286.9" dur="3.78">still be able to take out a loan and of</text>
  <text start="289.419" dur="2.761">course you&amp;#39;re going to bring a lot of</text>
  <text start="290.68" dur="3.78">people that shouldn&amp;#39;t be buying these</text>
  <text start="292.18" dur="4.89">houses there&amp;#39;ll be no checks and bounces</text>
  <text start="294.46" dur="5.61">on this there&amp;#39;ll be no due diligence on</text>
  <text start="297.07" dur="6.21">this and they will blow the bubble up a</text>
  <text start="300.07" dur="6.18">little bit longer and you know that this</text>
  <text start="303.28" dur="6.12">is going to be a disaster in the making</text>
  <text start="306.25" dur="5.4">and real estate will come tumbling down</text>
  <text start="309.4" dur="3.9">and I don&amp;#39;t really believe at this point</text>
  <text start="311.65" dur="4.35">this is actually going to help because</text>
  <text start="313.3" dur="5.1">most Americans out there they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="316" dur="3.99">tapped out completely they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="318.4" dur="3.18">looking yes they have a dream they would</text>
  <text start="319.99" dur="3.81">love to own a house but it seems like</text>
  <text start="321.58" dur="4.16">the resources right now and the income</text>
  <text start="323.8" dur="4.14">coming in even if they get a mortgage</text>
  <text start="325.74" dur="3.73">they&amp;#39;re thinking to themselves you know</text>
  <text start="327.94" dur="3.96">what we just won&amp;#39;t be able to sustain</text>
  <text start="329.47" dur="4.68">this and we we just can&amp;#39;t purchase these</text>
  <text start="331.9" dur="4.56">homes and I really don&amp;#39;t think this is</text>
  <text start="334.15" dur="5.579">going to help out at this point I do</text>
  <text start="336.46" dur="5.34">believe that central bankers the Fed do</text>
  <text start="339.729" dur="3.421">believe that if they pass this they can</text>
  <text start="341.8" dur="3.179">bring more and more people into the</text>
  <text start="343.15" dur="5.3">market and pump this up as best they can</text>
  <text start="344.979" dur="6.69">just like the auto industry where they</text>
  <text start="348.45" dur="5.23">allow subprime people in if you have a</text>
  <text start="351.669" dur="4.411">heartbeat you can get a car loan drive</text>
  <text start="353.68" dur="4.08">away but we see how we see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="356.08" dur="4.95">happening with that there are more</text>
  <text start="357.76" dur="5.31">delinquencies people are late on their</text>
  <text start="361.03" dur="3.63">payments the repo man&amp;#39;s coming they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="363.07" dur="4.469">taking the cars away because they really</text>
  <text start="364.66" dur="4.83">couldn&amp;#39;t afford these cars and and they</text>
  <text start="367.539" dur="5.701">don&amp;#39;t have the ability to keep up the</text>
  <text start="369.49" dur="6.06">payments and this is why this old starts</text>
  <text start="373.24" dur="6.149">to fall about fall apart sooner or later</text>
  <text start="375.55" dur="5.94">you just cannot sustain this okay now it</text>
  <text start="379.389" dur="4.951">looks like the Department of Homeland</text>
  <text start="381.49" dur="7.049">Security according to a recent study</text>
  <text start="384.34" dur="7.199">that they&amp;#39;ve created it shows that there</text>
  <text start="388.539" dur="5.94">is a rise of the sovereign citizen and</text>
  <text start="391.539" dur="6.301">this is America&amp;#39;s top domestic terrorist</text>
  <text start="394.479" dur="5.071">threat according to DHS experts say</text>
  <text start="397.84" dur="4.62">members of this movement are</text>
  <text start="399.55" dur="3.859">anti-government and often violent</text>
  <text start="402.46" dur="4.4">against</text>
  <text start="403.409" dur="5.16">law enforcement officials now this fits</text>
  <text start="406.86" dur="4.019">into many different things where if you</text>
  <text start="408.569" dur="6.27">look at all the alternative media pretty</text>
  <text start="410.879" dur="6.72">much they are speaking out against the</text>
  <text start="414.839" dur="5.7">government speaking out against the law</text>
  <text start="417.599" dur="5.19">enforcement agencies coming in hitting</text>
  <text start="420.539" dur="4.68">people for no reason pointing guns at</text>
  <text start="422.789" dur="5.52">people for no reason searching people</text>
  <text start="425.219" dur="5.85">for no reason so what DHS is really</text>
  <text start="428.309" dur="5.07">saying is that those people who do not</text>
  <text start="431.069" dur="3.93">agree with us and the way we treat you</text>
  <text start="433.379" dur="4.71">and the way the government does its</text>
  <text start="434.999" dur="5.43">operations and conducts itself well you</text>
  <text start="438.089" dur="4.2">have become the domestic terrorist and</text>
  <text start="440.429" dur="4.8">of course they&amp;#39;re using this sovereign</text>
  <text start="442.289" dur="6">citizen as a huge blanket to include</text>
  <text start="445.229" dur="4.86">anyone that is anti-government which is</text>
  <text start="448.289" dur="4.83">absolutely ridiculous because the First</text>
  <text start="450.089" dur="4.98">Amendment gives us the right to address</text>
  <text start="453.119" dur="4.62">our grievances against the government</text>
  <text start="455.069" dur="5.58">and we are allowed to speak out against</text>
  <text start="457.739" dur="5.25">the government but they do not want this</text>
  <text start="460.649" dur="5.64">and this is why they&amp;#39;re focusing on</text>
  <text start="462.989" dur="6.72">focusing in on those people who speak</text>
  <text start="466.289" dur="6.9">out that disagree who try to prove that</text>
  <text start="469.709" dur="5.49">the government is lying and again you</text>
  <text start="473.189" dur="5.4">see all the videos out there with police</text>
  <text start="475.199" dur="5.31">how violent they&amp;#39;ve become and any of</text>
  <text start="478.589" dur="3.87">those people that say you know what we</text>
  <text start="480.509" dur="3.33">need to put cameras on police we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="482.459" dur="2.94">think the police should have armored</text>
  <text start="483.839" dur="4.26">tanks we don&amp;#39;t think the police should</text>
  <text start="485.399" dur="5.22">have assault rifles walking around in</text>
  <text start="488.099" dur="5.73">fatigues pointing guns at people for no</text>
  <text start="490.619" dur="4.62">apparently for no apparent reason when</text>
  <text start="493.829" dur="3.18">they haven&amp;#39;t even committed a crime they</text>
  <text start="495.239" dur="4.11">haven&amp;#39;t even done anything and again</text>
  <text start="497.009" dur="4.71">this is what they&amp;#39;re looking at and as</text>
  <text start="499.349" dur="4.71">you can see every time we report on this</text>
  <text start="501.719" dur="5.22">it seems like they&amp;#39;re more interested in</text>
  <text start="504.059" dur="5.25">the American people and those people who</text>
  <text start="506.939" dur="3.87">are a threat to their authority then</text>
  <text start="509.309" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re looking out at terrorists</text>
  <text start="510.809" dur="4.77">because really the terrorists really</text>
  <text start="512.519" dur="6.12">don&amp;#39;t exist this was made up by them to</text>
  <text start="515.579" dur="5.25">give up our rights to keep us scared to</text>
  <text start="518.639" dur="6.231">keep us under a rock to make sure that</text>
  <text start="520.829" dur="7.081">we&amp;#39;re contained and controlled and and</text>
  <text start="524.87" dur="5.259">they want us to obey what they say and</text>
  <text start="527.91" dur="4.08">you can see that they&amp;#39;re getting worried</text>
  <text start="530.129" dur="3.51">right now and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="531.99" dur="3.99">starting to look around and this is why</text>
  <text start="533.639" dur="3.331">NSA has been spying this is why DHS has</text>
  <text start="535.98" dur="3">the fusion centers</text>
  <text start="536.97" dur="4.799">this is why they want you to get a real</text>
  <text start="538.98" dur="6.57">ID so they can take your fingerprint</text>
  <text start="541.769" dur="5.82">your retina scan put an RFID chip in the</text>
  <text start="545.55" dur="4.589">Real ID and the Real ID if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="547.589" dur="4.411">know what that is is it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="550.139" dur="3.211">replace your license and a lot of states</text>
  <text start="552" dur="4.199">have already started doing this and</text>
  <text start="553.35" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re going to issue a DHS type of</text>
  <text start="556.199" dur="3.721">license where the state has come in</text>
  <text start="557.73" dur="4.26">compliant and later on this will most</text>
  <text start="559.92" dur="4.05">likely be used for checkpoints where</text>
  <text start="561.99" dur="4.409">you&amp;#39;ll have to pull it out it goes into</text>
  <text start="563.97" dur="4.559">a federal database where it&amp;#39;ll check</text>
  <text start="566.399" dur="4.411">your credentials to make sure that you</text>
  <text start="568.529" dur="3.99">are actually a citizen and when you get</text>
  <text start="570.81" dur="4.11">this real ID you actually have to fill</text>
  <text start="572.519" dur="5.521">out paperwork and prove your citizenship</text>
  <text start="574.92" dur="4.56">and we can see right now that what</text>
  <text start="578.04" dur="3.359">they&amp;#39;re trying to do and it&amp;#39;s starting</text>
  <text start="579.48" dur="4.049">to look like Nazi Germany actually with</text>
  <text start="581.399" dur="4.56">give me your papers give me your real ID</text>
  <text start="583.529" dur="5.701">and they will eventually have</text>
  <text start="585.959" dur="6.781">checkpoints all across America now it</text>
  <text start="589.23" dur="5.7">looks like Russia is sending a flotilla</text>
  <text start="592.74" dur="4.62">to the Arctic and like I said a couple</text>
  <text start="594.93" dur="5.13">reports ago Canada the United States</text>
  <text start="597.36" dur="4.86">Europe and Russia they&amp;#39;re all fighting</text>
  <text start="600.06" dur="4.319">for the Arctic this is a strategic</text>

  <text start="621.6" dur="5.089">all these countries have started to set</text>
  <text start="624.12" dur="6.389">up their building basis they&amp;#39;re building</text>
  <text start="626.689" dur="7.21">platforms to get to that oil the natural</text>
  <text start="630.509" dur="6.69">resources in this area and everyone will</text>
  <text start="633.899" dur="5.37">be fighting for this area now we know</text>
  <text start="637.199" dur="5.13">out in Ukraine there is a ceasefire</text>
  <text start="639.269" dur="5.341">going on and that this was signed and</text>
  <text start="642.329" dur="6.3">poroshenko and the southeastern leaders</text>
  <text start="644.61" dur="6.329">have both agreed but according to the</text>
  <text start="648.629" dur="4.051">Donetsk Republic militia near Mara poll</text>
  <text start="650.939" dur="5.301">they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re still being</text>
  <text start="652.68" dur="6.029">shelled even though the truce is</text>
  <text start="656.24" dur="4.75">enforced right now there are still</text>
  <text start="658.709" dur="4.74">little small skirmishes they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="660.99" dur="7.019">shelling going on and it really hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="663.449" dur="6.57">stopped now it looks like porsche enka</text>
  <text start="668.009" dur="2.941">was interviewed by BBC correspondent</text>
  <text start="670.019" dur="3.541">steven</text>
  <text start="670.95" dur="4.26">/ and poroshenko saying that he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="673.56" dur="4.95">really believe that this ceasefire is</text>
  <text start="675.21" dur="4.77">going to be a long-term cease fire he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="678.51" dur="3.27">going to do everything in his power to</text>
  <text start="679.98" dur="4.65">keep peace he&amp;#39;s going to do everything</text>
  <text start="681.78" dur="4.89">to work with Ukrainian people to keep</text>
  <text start="684.63" dur="4.98">this but we&amp;#39;ve heard this once before</text>
  <text start="686.67" dur="5.52">and like I said this could be a tactic</text>
  <text start="689.61" dur="5.58">for a couple of reasons one to regroup</text>
  <text start="692.19" dur="6.51">bring in NATO forces bring in military</text>
  <text start="695.19" dur="6.69">assets to they Ukraine wants to join</text>
  <text start="698.7" dur="5.19">NATO now there is a ceasefire under NATO</text>
  <text start="701.88" dur="3.84">regulations you can&amp;#39;t join NATO if</text>
  <text start="703.89" dur="4.35">there&amp;#39;s some type of Civil War or a</text>
  <text start="705.72" dur="4.02">battle going on now it has stopped so</text>
  <text start="708.24" dur="4.05">this would give them the opportunity to</text>
  <text start="709.74" dur="4.47">join NATO once they join NATO have more</text>
  <text start="712.29" dur="4.25">forces come in and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="714.21" dur="6.21">start the fighting again so we can see</text>
  <text start="716.54" dur="6.28">that this is not what it seems to be but</text>
  <text start="720.42" dur="4.62">we&amp;#39;ll have to wait to see how this goes</text>
  <text start="722.82" dur="6.24">I&amp;#39;m just I&amp;#39;m getting the feeling that</text>
  <text start="725.04" dur="6.48">this is a strategy where poroshenko is</text>
  <text start="729.06" dur="4.71">using it to regroup he&amp;#39;s trying to get</text>
  <text start="731.52" dur="4.35">Ukraine to join NATO because the United</text>
  <text start="733.77" dur="4.26">States right now is pretty much saying</text>
  <text start="735.87" dur="3.6">no no we didn&amp;#39;t receive any app or NATO</text>
  <text start="738.03" dur="3.51">saying we&amp;#39;re not we haven&amp;#39;t received any</text>
  <text start="739.47" dur="3.84">application the United States saying no</text>
  <text start="741.54" dur="3.15">there&amp;#39;s no application made to NATO</text>
  <text start="743.31" dur="3.42">whatsoever they don&amp;#39;t they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="744.69" dur="5.04">join NATO and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="746.73" dur="4.89">yaks milk is pushing and saying yes</text>
  <text start="749.73" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re going to join NATO they want to</text>
  <text start="751.62" dur="6.6">join NATO and this whole thing seems</text>
  <text start="754.47" dur="7.05">like this might be a ploy by Ukraine to</text>
  <text start="758.22" dur="5.61">rebuild regroup join NATO get more</text>
  <text start="761.52" dur="5.01">military assets in there get more paid</text>
  <text start="763.83" dur="5.97">merit paid mercenaries in there and then</text>
  <text start="766.53" dur="7.23">start the fighting once again now NATO</text>
  <text start="769.8" dur="6.69">is out there and they are saying that if</text>
  <text start="773.76" dur="6.78">they are cyber type or any member state</text>
  <text start="776.49" dur="8.91">is cyber attacked this is going to be</text>
  <text start="780.54" dur="6.93">considered an act of war the decisions</text>
  <text start="785.4" dur="4.68">marks an expansion of the organization&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="787.47" dur="3.93">remit reflecting new threats that can</text>
  <text start="790.08" dur="3.21">disable critical infrastructure</text>
  <text start="791.4" dur="4.53">financial systems and government without</text>
  <text start="793.29" dur="4.5">firing a shot today we declare that</text>
  <text start="795.93" dur="4.65">cyber defense is part of NATO&amp;#39;s core</text>
  <text start="797.79" dur="5.76">tasks of collective defence so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="800.58" dur="4.319">already getting prepared and again there</text>
  <text start="803.55" dur="3.449">will be no proof</text>
  <text start="804.899" dur="3.511">of who caused this cyber attack they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="806.999" dur="4.231">just going to make up whoever they want</text>
  <text start="808.41" dur="5.789">and it&amp;#39;s very easily done so if a</text>
  <text start="811.23" dur="4.56">country is hit with a cyber attack and</text>
  <text start="814.199" dur="3.39">it brings down the financial system all</text>
  <text start="815.79" dur="4.38">they have to do is say Russia did it</text>
  <text start="817.589" dur="4.23">China did it and there&amp;#39;s really going to</text>
  <text start="820.17" dur="4.919">be no proof it&amp;#39;s almost like when they</text>
  <text start="821.819" dur="4.68">shot down mh17 they came out about a</text>
  <text start="825.089" dur="3.66">couple hours later and said it was</text>
  <text start="826.499" dur="4.981">absolutely Russia they did no research</text>
  <text start="828.749" dur="4.77">they didn&amp;#39;t try to prove anything they</text>
  <text start="831.48" dur="3.659">just decided to name whoever they wanted</text>
  <text start="833.519" dur="3.391">a name because it was part of the agenda</text>
  <text start="835.139" dur="5.76">and we&amp;#39;re going to see the same thing</text>
  <text start="836.91" dur="6.119">happen when this cyber attack occurs now</text>
  <text start="840.899" dur="3.66">it looks like the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="843.029" dur="4.05">is going to lift the long time</text>
  <text start="844.559" dur="5.34">restrictions on Libyans attending flight</text>
  <text start="847.079" dur="6.3">schools and we can see that they pass</text>
  <text start="849.899" dur="5.61">this law to disqualify all Libya</text>
  <text start="853.379" dur="5.13">Nationals and those acting on behalf of</text>
  <text start="855.509" dur="5.101">Libyan entities from train aviation</text>
  <text start="858.509" dur="5.401">maintenance flight operations or nuclear</text>
  <text start="860.61" dur="5.009">related fields DHS said the prohibition</text>
  <text start="863.91" dur="3.149">is irrelevant now since the United</text>
  <text start="865.619" dur="3.09">States and Libya have worked to</text>
  <text start="867.059" dur="4.38">normalize their relationship well it</text>
  <text start="868.709" dur="4.86">seems like the tribes have been taken</text>
  <text start="871.439" dur="4.411">over libya right now they&amp;#39;ve kicked the</text>
  <text start="873.569" dur="4.471">puppet government out and as soon as</text>
  <text start="875.85" dur="3.63">they drop the central bank and sell and</text>
  <text start="878.04" dur="3.599">they start to sell the oil not using the</text>
  <text start="879.48" dur="5.969">US dollar they might reverse this but</text>
  <text start="881.639" dur="6.661">this is also in accordance with those 11</text>
  <text start="885.449" dur="5.401">libyan air or 12 eliminate Libyan</text>
  <text start="888.3" dur="3.81">airliners that are missing allegedly we</text>
  <text start="890.85" dur="3.69">don&amp;#39;t know for sure of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="892.11" dur="4.769">using this as propaganda to convince us</text>
  <text start="894.54" dur="3.93">that these libyan airlines will be</text>
  <text start="896.879" dur="3.27">coming here to united states and if it</text>
  <text start="898.47" dur="3.929">is believe me it is not the tribes of</text>
  <text start="900.149" dur="4.831">libya it&amp;#39;s not al qaeda it&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="902.399" dur="4.651">Islamic state it will be an inside job</text>
  <text start="904.98" dur="5.579">most likely these Airlines will be flown</text>
  <text start="907.05" dur="5.519">remote control across into the United</text>
  <text start="910.559" dur="4.171">States to blow up maybe a couple of</text>
  <text start="912.569" dur="3.801">cities or things like that but bill</text>
  <text start="914.73" dur="3.99">gertz senior editor of The Washington</text>
  <text start="916.37" dur="4.36">free beacon said he has spoken with</text>
  <text start="918.72" dur="4.26">intelligence officials and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="920.73" dur="5.039">saying that the CIA is actively trying</text>
  <text start="922.98" dur="5.969">to locate these airliners and Gertz told</text>
  <text start="925.769" dur="5.28">John that al Qaeda has control of the</text>
  <text start="928.949" dur="3.87">commercial planes which could be used</text>
  <text start="931.049" dur="3.991">for an attack on US interest in the</text>
  <text start="932.819" dur="3.721">Middle East or as a way of transporting</text>
  <text start="935.04" dur="3.72">al Qaeda terrorists here to the United</text>
  <text start="936.54" dur="5.07">States or to any other location</text>
  <text start="938.76" dur="4.92">and we can see right now this is really</text>
  <text start="941.61" dur="3.63">not happening the tribes of Libya are</text>
  <text start="943.68" dur="3.93">concerned about taking back their own</text>
  <text start="945.24" dur="4.26">country of course the tribes they call</text>
  <text start="947.61" dur="4.41">them al Qaeda they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="949.5" dur="5.04">joining the Islamic state and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="952.02" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re part of this but you can rebut</text>
  <text start="954.54" dur="4.52">with you know what you have to</text>
  <text start="955.53" dur="6.96">understand is that every single country</text>
  <text start="959.06" dur="5.29">that the tribes are rising up they are</text>
  <text start="962.49" dur="5.76">trying to convince everyone that al</text>
  <text start="964.35" dur="6.03">Qaeda is getting stronger and al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="968.25" dur="4.83">is merging with the Islamic state and</text>
  <text start="970.38" dur="4.29">what you see is not much in the</text>
  <text start="973.08" dur="4.08">corporate media of what&amp;#39;s happening in</text>
  <text start="974.67" dur="4.35">Libya Lebanon and Yemen because they</text>
  <text start="977.16" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t want to bring attention to these</text>
  <text start="979.02" dur="4.41">countries where the people are actually</text>
  <text start="980.91" dur="4.32">rising up and this has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="983.43" dur="4.23">with terrorism they&amp;#39;re not broadcasting</text>
  <text start="985.23" dur="4.05">it they&amp;#39;re taking back their country</text>
  <text start="987.66" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re removing the government they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="989.28" dur="3.69">forming a new government and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="991.23" dur="3.09">want anyone to real lot they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="992.97" dur="3.3">anyone to realize that this is actually</text>
  <text start="994.32" dur="4.74">really happening so they have to use the</text>
  <text start="996.27" dur="6.57">Islamic state to convince everyone you</text>
  <text start="999.06" dur="5.76">have to remember every time a country is</text>
  <text start="1002.84" dur="4.38">taken over and a puppet regime is put</text>
  <text start="1004.82" dur="4.71">into place those people in that country</text>
  <text start="1007.22" dur="4.41">that did not agree with the new puppet</text>
  <text start="1009.53" dur="3.21">regime they are automatically called</text>
  <text start="1011.63" dur="3.96">terrorists look what happened in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1012.74" dur="4.56">as soon as the puppet regime was put</text>
  <text start="1015.59" dur="3.05">into place those people in the</text>

  <text start="1018.64" dur="5.17">referendum that said we do not want to</text>
  <text start="1021.59" dur="5.04">be part of this all of a sudden out of</text>

  <text start="1038.57" dur="4.23">the puppet regime in the country they</text>
  <text start="1040.64" dur="4.62">decided that they will now call them al</text>
