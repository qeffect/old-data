  <text start="117.299" dur="5.581">control the narrative and whatever they</text>

  <text start="129.84" dur="6.92">are now no longer in control they are</text>
  <text start="133.23" dur="6.36">losing the narrative how do we know this</text>
  <text start="136.76" dur="5.67">well we can see it from what is</text>
  <text start="139.59" dur="6.3">happening out in the UK for instance</text>
  <text start="142.43" dur="5.26">Boris Johnson he said okay listen you</text>
  <text start="145.89" dur="3.15">elected me I&amp;#39;m gonna follow through on</text>
  <text start="147.69" dur="4.62">the brexit let&amp;#39;s have another election</text>
  <text start="149.04" dur="5.43">the people spoke up no matter how much</text>
  <text start="152.31" dur="5.67">the mainstream media the central bank</text>
  <text start="154.47" dur="6.269">tried to scare the people making them</text>
  <text start="157.98" dur="4.39">think that if this happens your lives</text>
  <text start="160.739" dur="5.681">are doomed</text>
  <text start="162.37" dur="6.27">the fear tactics did not work that</text>
  <text start="166.42" dur="4.44">people said you know what whatever</text>
  <text start="168.64" dur="6.3">happens happens as long as we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="170.86" dur="8.37">part of a non-elected system and now the</text>
  <text start="174.94" dur="7.56">EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan he is</text>
  <text start="179.23" dur="6.089">telling everyone that Boris Johnson will</text>

  <text start="185.319" dur="8.7">the brexit the EU is in control why</text>
  <text start="190.54" dur="6.539">would they do this because they believe</text>
  <text start="194.019" dur="7.021">they have this plan they believe they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="197.079" dur="5.101">in control but they&amp;#39;re not this is</text>
  <text start="201.04" dur="4.38">coming out of fear</text>
  <text start="202.18" dur="6.21">remember when Trump first came into</text>
  <text start="205.42" dur="6.33">office what did the mainstream media and</text>
  <text start="208.39" dur="6.06">all the different politicians and the</text>
  <text start="211.75" dur="4.319">sore losers what they do they said that</text>
  <text start="214.45" dur="4.77">Trump is going to resign he was going to</text>
  <text start="216.069" dur="5.821">quit and after that didn&amp;#39;t happen after</text>
  <text start="219.22" dur="4.049">a year year and a half they said he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="221.89" dur="4.71">gonna be put into jail because of</text>
  <text start="223.269" dur="7.921">Russian collusion that didn&amp;#39;t happen all</text>
  <text start="226.6" dur="8.25">of this is coming out of fear fear that</text>
  <text start="231.19" dur="5.73">the people will wake up and see the</text>
  <text start="234.85" dur="3.06">central bank and all these individuals</text>
  <text start="236.92" dur="5.219">for what they really are</text>
  <text start="237.91" dur="8.1">and it&amp;#39;s getting very very close to that</text>
  <text start="242.139" dur="6.091">point in the UK and this is why the EU</text>
  <text start="246.01" dur="4.65">is now getting nervous</text>
  <text start="248.23" dur="4.379">they&amp;#39;re hoping and they probably have a</text>
  <text start="250.66" dur="4.079">lot of tricks up their sleeves they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="252.609" dur="3.99">gonna push fear I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised</text>
  <text start="254.739" dur="5.071">if we saw more events they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="256.599" dur="5.311">push this in the UK but I do believe</text>
  <text start="259.81" dur="3.63">that Boris Johnson hurry</text>
  <text start="261.91" dur="3.629">he already accounted for this they</text>
  <text start="263.44" dur="5.37">already know that this is going to</text>
  <text start="265.539" dur="7.171">happen just like he called them on these</text>
  <text start="268.81" dur="5.729">elections and we can see that they</text>
  <text start="272.71" dur="3.72">didn&amp;#39;t even stay in the chance they</text>
  <text start="274.539" dur="4.651">tried but they couldn&amp;#39;t do it you know</text>
  <text start="276.43" dur="5.45">why because they no longer control the</text>
  <text start="279.19" dur="6.18">narrative here in the United States</text>
  <text start="281.88" dur="6.159">every day that goes by the mainstream</text>
  <text start="285.37" dur="5.669">media is losing control of the economic</text>
  <text start="288.039" dur="5.641">narrative Trump is continually gaining</text>
  <text start="291.039" dur="3.881">more and more momentum remember he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="293.68" dur="4.09">trying to make this</text>
  <text start="294.92" dur="3.66">to a bank system great he&amp;#39;s not trying</text>
  <text start="297.77" dur="4.86">to fix it</text>
  <text start="298.58" dur="6.24">it&amp;#39;s unfixable right now and he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="302.63" dur="5.73">want this to exist because it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="304.82" dur="6.12">people system he&amp;#39;s using all the weapons</text>
  <text start="308.36" dur="5.55">against the central bank system itself</text>
  <text start="310.94" dur="5.19">but a new poll finds that 80 percent of</text>
  <text start="313.91" dur="4.74">Americans believe their lives will get</text>
  <text start="316.13" dur="5.79">better in the coming year and it&amp;#39;s all</text>

  <text start="411.65" dur="5.28">we mentioned this yesterday and it looks</text>
  <text start="414.11" dur="4.68">like he&amp;#39;s confirming he said I&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="416.93" dur="4.32">signing our very large and comprehensive</text>
  <text start="418.79" dur="5.73">phase 1 trade deal with China on January</text>

  <text start="430.17" dur="9.05">where talks will begin on phase 2 Trump</text>
  <text start="434.25" dur="8.67">now has established the first part of</text>
  <text start="439.22" dur="7.57">the plan for the economy think about</text>
  <text start="442.92" dur="5.82">what he has done he needed to reverse</text>
  <text start="446.79" dur="4.44">everything that global as the central</text>
  <text start="448.74" dur="5.31">banks were doing he needed to shrink the</text>
  <text start="451.23" dur="5.52">gap between the very wealthy and the</text>
  <text start="454.05" dur="5.85">very poor and we could see that if</text>
  <text start="456.75" dur="5.25">shrinking now wages are now rising he</text>
  <text start="459.9" dur="3.54">needed to bring back manufacturing he</text>
  <text start="462" dur="3.84">knew that he didn&amp;#39;t have enough time to</text>
  <text start="463.44" dur="3.99">fully bring back every single</text>
  <text start="465.84" dur="4.41">manufacturer here to the United States</text>
  <text start="467.43" dur="4.32">so the next best thing was first to</text>
  <text start="470.25" dur="2.76">remove NAFTA but that was kind of</text>
  <text start="471.75" dur="4.71">difficult because it was tied up in</text>
  <text start="473.01" dur="6.6">Congress so he renegotiated it and made</text>
  <text start="476.46" dur="5.55">a manufacturing powerhouse between</text>
  <text start="479.61" dur="6.24">Mexico the United States and Canada to</text>
  <text start="482.01" dur="5.67">go up against the globalists remember</text>

  <text start="492.57" dur="4.92">to compete against that this is part of</text>
  <text start="495.93" dur="5.19">the first phase he also got rid of all</text>
  <text start="497.49" dur="6.93">the globalist plans and we can see he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="501.12" dur="7.47">now moving into the next phase phase two</text>
  <text start="504.42" dur="7.89">of the China deal and moving forward</text>
