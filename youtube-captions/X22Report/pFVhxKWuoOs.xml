  <text start="158.25" dur="4.83">stealing my money from the inside and</text>
  <text start="160.65" dur="5.52">the same things going to happen here in</text>
  <text start="163.08" dur="5.19">the United States in Canada Europe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="166.17" dur="4.82">going to happen in Australia it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="168.27" dur="5.13">to happen Switzerland pretty much</text>
  <text start="170.99" dur="5.41">everywhere where the private western</text>
  <text start="173.4" dur="7.08">central banking system is enforced right</text>
  <text start="176.4" dur="6.12">now now we can see Europe the euro</text>
  <text start="180.48" dur="4.05">nations they are doing absolutely</text>
  <text start="182.52" dur="4.77">horrible we go over this many many times</text>
  <text start="184.53" dur="6.51">but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="187.29" dur="6.69">those countries that receive help from</text>
  <text start="191.04" dur="6.33">the central bankers these are the</text>
  <text start="193.98" dur="4.47">countries that are doing the worst so if</text>
  <text start="197.37" dur="2.94">we look at this and we look at their</text>
  <text start="198.45" dur="3.33">unemployment numbers they are just</text>
  <text start="200.31" dur="3.48">horrible of course these are the</text>
  <text start="201.78" dur="4.56">governmental unemployment numbers and</text>
  <text start="203.79" dur="4.14">who knows what the real calculations are</text>
  <text start="206.34" dur="3.18">just like here in the United States we</text>
  <text start="207.93" dur="4.47">have a six point one percent but we know</text>
  <text start="209.52" dur="4.26">for a fact that this number is between</text>
  <text start="212.4" dur="3.6">thirty and thirty seven percent</text>
  <text start="213.78" dur="5.01">depending on the calculation and here in</text>
  <text start="216" dur="5.57">Europe we&amp;#39;re seeing Greece is around 26</text>
  <text start="218.79" dur="7.23">27 / twenty-six twenty-seven percent</text>
  <text start="221.57" dur="8.86">Spain is at 25 and a half percent Cyprus</text>
  <text start="226.02" dur="6.3">is at seventeen eighteen percent Croatia</text>
  <text start="230.43" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re looking at about eighteen</text>
  <text start="232.32" dur="4.41">percent Portugal they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="233.94" dur="6.15">sixteen percent at Bulgaria they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="236.73" dur="5.1">looking at fourteen percent Italy</text>
  <text start="240.09" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re looking at about thirteen</text>
  <text start="241.83" dur="4.29">percent so you can see right now that</text>
  <text start="243.63" dur="4.47">these countries that have been receiving</text>
  <text start="246.12" dur="4.41">help from the central bankers their</text>
  <text start="248.1" dur="4.77">unemployment skyrocketed and when you go</text>
  <text start="250.53" dur="5.46">down the list of unemployment and you</text>
  <text start="252.87" dur="5.46">hit Germany or Austria they have the</text>
  <text start="255.99" dur="3.809">lowest unemployment right now and they</text>
  <text start="258.33" dur="4.2">have not received any help whatsoever</text>
  <text start="259.799" dur="5.011">but you can see the European nations</text>
  <text start="262.53" dur="7.34">they have very very high unemployment</text>
  <text start="264.81" dur="8.64">numbers and they are just going up and</text>
  <text start="269.87" dur="5.05">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="273.45" dur="4.11">Europe is</text>
  <text start="274.92" dur="6.12">really heading into a depression right</text>
  <text start="277.56" dur="5.97">now grease tops the eurozone poverty</text>
  <text start="281.04" dur="4.8">rate Greece ranks first in the eurozone</text>
  <text start="283.53" dur="4.41">and forth among the 28 members of the</text>
  <text start="285.84" dur="4.41">European Union for the percentage of its</text>
  <text start="287.94" dur="4.65">citizens living on or below the poverty</text>
  <text start="290.25" dur="3.75">line according to this new report that</text>
  <text start="292.59" dur="3.87">came out the study conducted by the</text>
  <text start="294" dur="5.64">foundation for economic and industrial</text>
  <text start="296.46" dur="7.68">research found that just just over a</text>
  <text start="299.64" dur="6.84">third 34.6 percent of Greeks some 3.7</text>
  <text start="304.14" dur="4.29">million individuals were living on less</text>
  <text start="306.48" dur="5.79">than sixty percent of the national</text>
  <text start="308.43" dur="8.58">median income in 2013 in the EU Bulgaria</text>
  <text start="312.27" dur="7.02">is at 49.3 Romania is at 41.7 Latvia is</text>
  <text start="317.01" dur="4.32">at thirty six point two percent have the</text>
  <text start="319.29" dur="4.8">highest percentages of people living in</text>
  <text start="321.33" dur="5.61">relative poverty and we can see right</text>
  <text start="324.09" dur="5.34">now there are other nations like Ireland</text>
  <text start="326.94" dur="4.38">is at thirty percent spain at 28.2</text>
  <text start="329.43" dur="4.41">percent cyprus is at twenty seven point</text>
  <text start="331.32" dur="4.89">one percent and portugal is at twenty</text>
  <text start="333.84" dur="5.16">five point three percent so the european</text>
  <text start="336.21" dur="4.77">nations are struggling things are</text>
  <text start="339" dur="4.46">getting worse there they are not getting</text>
  <text start="340.98" dur="5.7">better but here in the united states</text>
  <text start="343.46" dur="5.56">everything is absolutely fine there are</text>
  <text start="346.68" dur="5.61">no problems we&amp;#39;re seeing the initial</text>
  <text start="349.02" dur="6.18">jobless claims plunge to levels back in</text>
  <text start="352.29" dur="5.57">2005 they&amp;#39;re letting us now all these</text>
  <text start="355.2" dur="5.67">layoffs all these retail store closures</text>
  <text start="357.86" dur="4.63">nobody&amp;#39;s applying for unemployment and</text>
  <text start="360.87" dur="4.02">of course we have to remember and report</text>
  <text start="362.49" dur="4.14">that I did while back those people who</text>
  <text start="364.89" dur="4.53">are in retail that have part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="366.63" dur="4.14">they have to meet and each state has</text>
  <text start="369.42" dur="3.69">their own calculation but they have to</text>
  <text start="370.77" dur="4.41">meet a certain criteria they have to</text>
  <text start="373.11" dur="5.19">work at least a certain number of hours</text>
  <text start="375.18" dur="6.06">and making a certain number of hours per</text>
  <text start="378.3" dur="5.43">week to put in a claim and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="381.24" dur="4.59">that most of these people don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="383.73" dur="5.64">ability to put a claim in but they are</text>
  <text start="385.83" dur="5.67">unemployed and they are not counted and</text>
  <text start="389.37" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re not counted in the claim process</text>
  <text start="391.5" dur="5.49">either now we see major corporations are</text>
  <text start="395.13" dur="4.08">starting to lay off we see Microsoft</text>
  <text start="396.99" dur="3.99">laying off 18,000 beginning of this year</text>
  <text start="399.21" dur="4.05">we have thousands upon thousands of</text>
  <text start="400.98" dur="5.22">people and most of these people do get</text>
  <text start="403.26" dur="5.3">severance payments and some go from you</text>
  <text start="406.2" dur="4.79">know four weeks all the way out to one</text>
  <text start="408.56" dur="5.94">year so depending on the time frame and</text>
  <text start="410.99" dur="5.88">when it runs out they will be accessing</text>
  <text start="414.5" dur="4.8">the unemployment benefits and as we go</text>
  <text start="416.87" dur="5.49">through the year what we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="419.3" dur="4.83">is that more and more corporations are</text>
  <text start="422.36" dur="3.27">going to be laying off now the Labor</text>
  <text start="424.13" dur="3.42">Department saying you know don&amp;#39;t look</text>
  <text start="425.63" dur="3.6">too closely at these jobless claims</text>
  <text start="427.55" dur="4.02">numbers even though they&amp;#39;re very good</text>
  <text start="429.23" dur="4.71">because what they&amp;#39;re saying is that we</text>
  <text start="431.57" dur="5.79">have a lot of auto shut downs during the</text>
  <text start="433.94" dur="6.27">summer which is true and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="437.36" dur="5.34">that the summer is a very volatile time</text>
  <text start="440.21" dur="5.13">of the year so we might see this number</text>
  <text start="442.7" dur="5.01">really tick up as we come out of the</text>
  <text start="445.34" dur="5.579">summer and I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s going to really</text>
  <text start="447.71" dur="5.07">tick up by quite a bit now it looks like</text>
  <text start="450.919" dur="4.711">Bombardier is going to be laying off</text>
  <text start="452.78" dur="4.71">about 1,800 people yesterday I said</text>
  <text start="455.63" dur="3.84">Dick&amp;#39;s Sporting Goods in there a golf</text>
  <text start="457.49" dur="5.37">pro shop they were laying off 400 while</text>
  <text start="459.47" dur="7.14">they upped it to 78 more people round</text>
  <text start="462.86" dur="6.059">point mortgage letting go a hundred and</text>
  <text start="466.61" dur="5.85">sixty-six people now if the real estate</text>
  <text start="468.919" dur="6.481">market is booming it&amp;#39;s recovering it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="472.46" dur="5.49">rebounding more people need mortgages</text>
  <text start="475.4" dur="4.5">right because who has all that cash in</text>
  <text start="477.95" dur="4.56">their pocket to go out and buy that</text>
  <text start="479.9" dur="4.44">house not many people so that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="482.51" dur="5.52">use a mortgage that&amp;#39;s why they get a car</text>
  <text start="484.34" dur="6.15">loan but they&amp;#39;re laying off people the</text>
  <text start="488.03" dur="5.22">question is why why did wells fargo</text>
  <text start="490.49" dur="6.08">Citibank JP Morgan Chase Bank of America</text>
  <text start="493.25" dur="6.96">lay off tens of thousands of people</text>
  <text start="496.57" dur="5.05">starting back in August of 2013 going</text>
  <text start="500.21" dur="3.12">through this year because they realized</text>
  <text start="501.62" dur="4.14">the people that are buying the houses</text>
  <text start="503.33" dur="4.86">are not the Americans it is the</text>
  <text start="505.76" dur="6.51">investment companies it is the in veg</text>
  <text start="508.19" dur="5.94">funds it is foreign nationals from China</text>
  <text start="512.27" dur="4.62">and other nations coming in and</text>
  <text start="514.13" dur="3.99">purchasing in cash so there&amp;#39;s no need to</text>
  <text start="516.89" dur="4.35">go get a mortgage but you have to</text>
  <text start="518.12" dur="6.18">remember the base of this economy is the</text>
  <text start="521.24" dur="5.46">American people they lost thirty eight</text>
  <text start="524.3" dur="4.26">percent of their wealth during 2008 a</text>
  <text start="526.7" dur="3.54">lot of people had foreclosures there</text>
  <text start="528.56" dur="3.029">were a lot of short sales a lot of</text>
  <text start="530.24" dur="3.71">people had their credit ruined they</text>
  <text start="531.589" dur="5.101">couldn&amp;#39;t find jobs or underemployed so</text>
  <text start="533.95" dur="5.32">Americans are just not buying homes</text>
  <text start="536.69" dur="4.019">right now and we&amp;#39;re seeing this spread</text>
  <text start="539.27" dur="3.15">throughout the country we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="540.709" dur="3.391">prices level off or</text>
  <text start="542.42" dur="3.659">actually starting to see them dip we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="544.1" dur="6.33">seeing houses staying on the market</text>
  <text start="546.079" dur="6.781">longer and longer and back in i think it</text>
  <text start="550.43" dur="4.02">was like March or something I said there</text>
  <text start="552.86" dur="3.51">was going to be a little bump in the</text>
  <text start="554.45" dur="4.35">summer and we did see the bump in the</text>
  <text start="556.37" dur="6">spring summer and now we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="558.8" dur="6.24">complete decline of real estate now</text>
  <text start="562.37" dur="7.44">right now US manufacturing dropped by</text>
  <text start="565.04" dur="8.07">from 57.3 to 56.3 this is the biggest</text>
  <text start="569.81" dur="5.73">miss on record and the second miss in a</text>
  <text start="573.11" dur="5.599">row new export orders weaken</text>
  <text start="575.54" dur="6.479">manufacturing production fell in port</text>
  <text start="578.709" dur="6.731">input costs surged and employment</text>
  <text start="582.019" dur="7.051">tumbled to 10 month lows job creation</text>
  <text start="585.44" dur="7.44">slid to its lowest since last September</text>
  <text start="589.07" dur="6.24">so we are seeing every type of industry</text>
  <text start="592.88" dur="5.009">struggling just to stay afloat right now</text>
  <text start="595.31" dur="5.19">now caterpillar and I mentioned this in</text>
  <text start="597.889" dur="5.281">many of my reports this is a very good</text>
  <text start="600.5" dur="4.29">indicator to see how sales are across</text>
  <text start="603.17" dur="3.87">the world and it&amp;#39;s a good indicator of</text>
  <text start="604.79" dur="6.12">pretty much how the economy is doing and</text>
  <text start="607.04" dur="5.76">let me just say caterpillar there is no</text>
  <text start="610.91" dur="3.21">recovery here I know there&amp;#39;s corporate</text>
  <text start="612.8" dur="4.469">media&amp;#39;s out there saying they&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="614.12" dur="6.719">recovery the graph is in a downward</text>
  <text start="617.269" dur="6.091">slide and starting in december of 2012</text>
  <text start="620.839" dur="5.851">and continuing through today caterpillar</text>
  <text start="623.36" dur="6.539">has reported 19 consecutive months of</text>
  <text start="626.69" dur="7.259">decline in global year-over-year retail</text>
  <text start="629.899" dur="5.88">sales the last and only time it had 19</text>
  <text start="633.949" dur="5.061">consecutive months of such a decline</text>
  <text start="635.779" dur="7.8">guess when that was that&amp;#39;s right it was</text>
  <text start="639.01" dur="9.6">2008 when Lehman filed for bankruptcy we</text>
  <text start="643.579" dur="8.101">are headed in the same exact direction</text>
  <text start="648.61" dur="6.039">now we talked about real estate quite a</text>
