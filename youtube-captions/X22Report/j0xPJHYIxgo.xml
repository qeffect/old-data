  <text start="82.36" dur="3.9">looking at different countries we know a</text>
  <text start="84.22" dur="4.05">lot of countries have a lot of debt we</text>
  <text start="86.26" dur="4.05">know there&amp;#39;s austerity on the people</text>
  <text start="88.27" dur="5.28">because this is what the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="90.31" dur="5.22">want we know Greece they have been under</text>
  <text start="93.55" dur="7.29">austerity for a very long time Cyprus</text>
  <text start="95.53" dur="6.659">France Italy Spain and here in the</text>
  <text start="100.84" dur="2.819">United States people are sitting back</text>
  <text start="102.189" dur="4.71">saying oh that will never happen here</text>
  <text start="103.659" dur="6.39">it&amp;#39;s completely impossible well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="106.899" dur="6.421">about to change in Puerto Rico right now</text>
  <text start="110.049" dur="6.78">they&amp;#39;re going to face strict austerity</text>
  <text start="113.32" dur="6.509">measures including a huge cut in the</text>
  <text start="116.829" dur="6">minimum wage it&amp;#39;s very odd because here</text>
  <text start="119.829" dur="5.881">in the states they were telling everyone</text>
  <text start="122.829" dur="4.741">that we have to increase in minimum wage</text>
  <text start="125.71" dur="5.72">in Puerto Rico they&amp;#39;re going to cut</text>
  <text start="127.57" dur="5.88">minimum wage if President Obama and</text>
  <text start="131.43" dur="5.35">Congress are able to pass their</text>
  <text start="133.45" dur="5.07">so-called promesa bailout package which</text>
  <text start="136.78" dur="3.66">stands for Puerto Rico oversight</text>
  <text start="138.52" dur="8.79">management and economic stability act</text>
  <text start="140.44" dur="8.94">which really means austerity we are</text>
  <text start="147.31" dur="6.42">going to see the people in Puerto Rico</text>
  <text start="149.38" dur="6.71">suffer now Obama has urged the Senators</text>
  <text start="153.73" dur="6.27">to approve this bill very very quickly</text>
  <text start="156.09" dur="5.89">even though the 3.5 million residents of</text>
  <text start="160" dur="3.55">the US territory can&amp;#39;t vote for the</text>
  <text start="161.98" dur="4.36">president or</text>
  <text start="163.55" dur="5.78">legislators in the general election they</text>
  <text start="166.34" dur="5.76">could be forced to swallow this new bill</text>
  <text start="169.33" dur="7.62">which prioritizes the interests of</text>
  <text start="172.1" dur="8.01">vulture funds and other bondholders and</text>
  <text start="176.95" dur="6.28">when we look at this what do we see</text>
  <text start="180.11" dur="6.36">happening here we see that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="183.23" dur="5.91">to privatize a lot of what&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="186.47" dur="5.04">country just like we saw in Greece just</text>
  <text start="189.14" dur="5.7">like what we saw in Cyprus like we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="191.51" dur="6.24">been seeing in Ukraine and all of this</text>
  <text start="194.84" dur="5.16">is going to go to the creditors and this</text>
  <text start="197.75" dur="5.97">looks exactly like what Greece is going</text>
  <text start="200" dur="6.06">through same exact thing now Puerto Rico</text>
  <text start="203.72" dur="5.1">they are unable to file for bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="206.06" dur="5.34">after an amendment made to the US law</text>
  <text start="208.82" dur="6.21">exempted the territory from the chapter</text>
  <text start="211.4" dur="6.93">9 option not clear why this was done</text>
  <text start="215.03" dur="7.11">this way but we see at this point that</text>
  <text start="218.33" dur="7.14">the people are going to feel what</text>
  <text start="222.14" dur="6.69">austerity feels like and this is just</text>
  <text start="225.47" dur="7.97">the beginning welcome to the collapse</text>
  <text start="228.83" dur="10.85">here it is started it&amp;#39;s going to spread</text>
  <text start="233.44" dur="9.76">now the government the corporate media</text>
  <text start="239.68" dur="6.52">they are continually out there telling</text>
  <text start="243.2" dur="5.13">us how great the economy is doing except</text>
  <text start="246.2" dur="3.87">for this little area over here except</text>
  <text start="248.33" dur="5.3">for Detroit except for Puerto Rico</text>
  <text start="250.07" dur="6.09">except for Europe we&amp;#39;re doing fantastic</text>
  <text start="253.63" dur="6.039">so they&amp;#39;re out there telling everyone</text>
  <text start="256.16" dur="4.74">how great retail sales are and when we</text>
  <text start="259.669" dur="3.601">look at this and we look at the numbers</text>
  <text start="260.9" dur="4.26">we say hmm really retail is improving</text>
  <text start="263.27" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;re having more stores closed down</text>
  <text start="265.16" dur="4.92">we&amp;#39;re having more layoffs in retail we</text>
  <text start="267.95" dur="5.01">see it completely contracting lush</text>
  <text start="270.08" dur="5.46">luxury retailers are down home</text>
  <text start="272.96" dur="6.209">improvement is down department stores</text>
  <text start="275.54" dur="6.48">are down sporting good is down furniture</text>
  <text start="279.169" dur="6">stores are down but they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="282.02" dur="5.37">everything is incredible well then we</text>
  <text start="285.169" dur="6.721">look at the numbers and we say hmm why</text>
  <text start="287.39" dur="8.09">is this well remember they count gas</text>
  <text start="291.89" dur="7.69">purchases as retail</text>
  <text start="295.48" dur="6.99">and when you look at this we see that</text>
  <text start="299.58" dur="6.1">the biggest contributor to maize gains</text>
  <text start="302.47" dur="6.6">was a 2.1 percent jump in gasoline</text>
  <text start="305.68" dur="6.69">station spending as close prices have</text>
  <text start="309.07" dur="5.07">gone up on gas and you&amp;#39;re on your growth</text>
  <text start="312.37" dur="4.44">and retail sales slowed to just two</text>
  <text start="314.14" dur="7.88">point five percent building materials</text>
  <text start="316.81" dur="7.62">garden supplies furniture stores</text>
  <text start="322.02" dur="4.51">department stores they&amp;#39;ve all declined</text>
  <text start="324.43" dur="5.58">by one point eight percent in the month</text>
  <text start="326.53" dur="7.02">and when we look at this we see that</text>
  <text start="330.01" dur="7.38">retail it&amp;#39;s not improving actually the</text>
  <text start="333.55" dur="6.3">national retail sales fell one percent</text>
  <text start="337.39" dur="5.37">during the first two weeks of june this</text>
  <text start="339.85" dur="6.78">is coming from redbook research research</text>
  <text start="342.76" dur="7.68">which reported it today so already in</text>
  <text start="346.63" dur="6.66">June sales are down now if gas prices</text>
  <text start="350.44" dur="4.08">continually rise they&amp;#39;re gonna flip it</text>
  <text start="353.29" dur="3.63">around and tell you that everything is</text>
  <text start="354.52" dur="4.02">fine that we&amp;#39;re looking at an increase</text>
  <text start="356.92" dur="4.14">of retail and of course they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="358.54" dur="5.43">terms like oh retail is bouncing back</text>
  <text start="361.06" dur="7.38">retail is on the mend retail is going to</text>
  <text start="363.97" dur="8.7">take off now no no it&amp;#39;s not this is the</text>
  <text start="368.44" dur="5.58">headlines they use to fool everyone you</text>
  <text start="372.67" dur="4.41">know how many times they&amp;#39;ve said this</text>
  <text start="374.02" dur="6.18">already this is the fifth time in the</text>
  <text start="377.08" dur="7.14">last two years where they said retail</text>
  <text start="380.2" dur="8.42">housing it&amp;#39;s going to take off and guess</text>
  <text start="384.22" dur="8.13">what it hasn&amp;#39;t they&amp;#39;re lying to you and</text>
  <text start="388.62" dur="6.37">they continually lie we see</text>
  <text start="392.35" dur="4.86">year-over-year inventories have risen by</text>
  <text start="394.99" dur="4.74">one percent while sales have tumbled by</text>
  <text start="397.21" dur="4.92">one-point-three percent so we can see at</text>
  <text start="399.73" dur="5.61">this point we&amp;#39;re heading to the same</text>
  <text start="402.13" dur="5.82">area that we were back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="405.34" dur="4.59">eight at the height of the economy where</text>
  <text start="407.95" dur="4.14">they said everything is fantastic it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="409.93" dur="5.13">all contained and then it came crumbling</text>
  <text start="412.09" dur="9.6">down well business inventories to sales</text>
  <text start="415.06" dur="10.68">back then was around 1.50 back in two</text>
  <text start="421.69" dur="7.439">thousand eight it dropped all the way</text>
  <text start="425.74" dur="8.539">down to 1.25 we are now at one point</text>
  <text start="429.129" dur="11.731">point four and it&amp;#39;s already falling</text>
  <text start="434.279" dur="8.43">which tells us that this entire system</text>
  <text start="440.86" dur="4.799">that we&amp;#39;re looking at this economy is</text>
  <text start="442.709" dur="6.33">heading for a major major collapse</text>
  <text start="445.659" dur="9.57">because as we know most of the sector&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="449.039" dur="7.72">they were created as bubbles and this</text>
  <text start="455.229" dur="3.48">was created by the US government central</text>
  <text start="456.759" dur="5.55">bankers to convince everyone that</text>
  <text start="458.709" dur="4.92">everything is a-okay they manipulated</text>
  <text start="462.309" dur="4.491">these statistical numbers like</text>
  <text start="463.629" dur="6.421">unemployment GDP inflation and so forth</text>
  <text start="466.8" dur="8.739">they went around the country created the</text>
  <text start="470.05" dur="8.429">bubbles printed a lot of currency and we</text>
  <text start="475.539" dur="4.65">see the service sector manufacturing all</text>
  <text start="478.479" dur="3.42">declining the Baltic Dry Index has</text>
  <text start="480.189" dur="4.921">dropped by one point down to six hundred</text>
  <text start="481.899" dur="6.39">and eight and we see bank of america</text>
  <text start="485.11" dur="6.389">clients once again they are selling</text>
  <text start="488.289" dur="5.28">stocks like crazy trying to get out of</text>
  <text start="491.499" dur="4.41">the market and again the market did not</text>
  <text start="493.569" dur="5.22">do that well we see gold now is</text>
  <text start="495.909" dur="4.59">approaching 1300 and this is something</text>
  <text start="498.789" dur="4.38">that we need to watch very carefully</text>
  <text start="500.499" dur="5.4">like I said this is going to be a very</text>
  <text start="503.169" dur="4.86">good indicator because once we see gold</text>
  <text start="505.899" dur="4.08">moving up sixty seventy eighty dollars</text>
  <text start="508.029" dur="4.74">and they can only suppress it by 20 and</text>
  <text start="509.979" dur="4.98">it continually moves up this is a signal</text>
  <text start="512.769" dur="4.471">where everyone should say okay I need to</text>
  <text start="514.959" dur="3.781">start ramping up what I&amp;#39;m doing here you</text>
  <text start="517.24" dur="3.929">don&amp;#39;t have cash on hand you better get</text>
  <text start="518.74" dur="7.349">it you don&amp;#39;t have gold or silver this is</text>
  <text start="521.169" dur="8.34">your opportunity to do this Deutsche</text>
  <text start="526.089" dur="5.701">Bank their model out there is saying</text>
  <text start="529.509" dur="6.111">that there&amp;#39;s a fifty five percent chance</text>
  <text start="531.79" dur="7.14">the US is going to go into a recession</text>
  <text start="535.62" dur="5.709">into a recession we&amp;#39;re already in the</text>
  <text start="538.93" dur="5.79">recession what they&amp;#39;re really saying is</text>
  <text start="541.329" dur="7.801">this entire economy is going to go into</text>
  <text start="544.72" dur="6.21">a collapse full-blown where everyone</text>
  <text start="549.13" dur="4.8">will be aware of it now there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="550.93" dur="4.8">people out there who say well we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="553.93" dur="5.43">collapse now yes some of the people are</text>
  <text start="555.73" dur="6.599">feeling it others are not and it is</text>
  <text start="559.36" dur="3.66">spreading yes but when we&amp;#39;re in the full</text>
  <text start="562.329" dur="3.091">collapse</text>
  <text start="563.02" dur="5.76">everyone is going to notice the</text>
  <text start="565.42" dur="6.06">corporate media will have to recognize</text>
  <text start="568.78" dur="4.59">that something is wrong there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="571.48" dur="3.72">out of this it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="573.37" dur="5.34">because I was speaking to my father and</text>
  <text start="575.2" dur="6.63">he does not go along with whatever I say</text>
  <text start="578.71" dur="5.31">here actually were on opposite ends of</text>
  <text start="581.83" dur="3.78">the spectrum here but he did say</text>
  <text start="584.02" dur="4.59">something very interesting to me that</text>
  <text start="585.61" dur="7.74">he&amp;#39;s saying that he&amp;#39;s hearing things</text>
  <text start="588.61" dur="7.74">about the economy not doing well and it</text>
  <text start="593.35" dur="6.15">might collapse and my money might not be</text>
  <text start="596.35" dur="5.01">worth something later on which I found</text>
  <text start="599.5" dur="3.99">very interesting and then I started to</text>
  <text start="601.36" dur="4.23">explain to him you know what was really</text>
  <text start="603.49" dur="5.88">going on and he kind of shut down a</text>
  <text start="605.59" dur="4.98">little bit but he is now hearing it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="609.37" dur="3.84">going to take a little while for him to</text>
  <text start="610.57" dur="4.89">accept what is going on he did ask me</text>
  <text start="613.21" dur="4.8">what I should do I told him to buy gold</text>
  <text start="615.46" dur="4.95">and silver I told them where to do it a</text>
  <text start="618.01" dur="3.93">lot of times I don&amp;#39;t approach my family</text>
  <text start="620.41" dur="3.69">members if they do ask me a question I</text>
  <text start="621.94" dur="5.01">will answer them a lot of times they do</text>
  <text start="624.1" dur="5.73">shut down I know a lot of people feel or</text>
  <text start="626.95" dur="4.86">see or have the same thing happening and</text>
  <text start="629.83" dur="3.72">it is very difficult to make people</text>
  <text start="631.81" dur="4.29">understand what is really going on here</text>
  <text start="633.55" dur="3.84">and I brought this up to him many many</text>
  <text start="636.1" dur="3.54">times before he asked me the same</text>
  <text start="637.39" dur="3.84">questions what should i do and you know</text>
  <text start="639.64" dur="4.68">for many years now I&amp;#39;ve been telling him</text>
  <text start="641.23" dur="5.67">the same exact thing and you know he</text>
  <text start="644.32" dur="4.5">doesn&amp;#39;t like to listen but I find that a</text>
  <text start="646.9" dur="5.16">lot of people who write in say the same</text>
  <text start="648.82" dur="5.79">exact thing now we understand the brexit</text>
  <text start="652.06" dur="6.84">is coming up we know there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="654.61" dur="8.07">a vote we already see the ECB they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="658.9" dur="4.77">preparing for this brexit what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="662.68" dur="4.71">going to say is they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="663.67" dur="6.51">monetize the entire thing if the UK</text>
  <text start="667.39" dur="6.86">should leave the euro they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="670.18" dur="6.9">make sure that the system continues on</text>
  <text start="674.25" dur="5.14">now the ECB they pledged that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="677.08" dur="4.5">going to involve opening so-called swap</text>
  <text start="679.39" dur="3.36">lines with the Bank of England allowing</text>
  <text start="681.58" dur="3.39">the euro and the Sterling to be</text>
  <text start="682.75" dur="4.74">exchanged and effectively make unlimited</text>
  <text start="684.97" dur="4.95">funding in both currencies available to</text>
  <text start="687.49" dur="4.71">European banks but you have to remember</text>
  <text start="689.92" dur="5.45">that the ECB is limited in what they can</text>
  <text start="692.2" dur="4.77">do beyond releasing funds for banks</text>
  <text start="695.37" dur="4.42">extending its money</text>
  <text start="696.97" dur="4.65">printing program which really has</text>
  <text start="699.79" dur="3.149">already saturated the markets completely</text>
  <text start="701.62" dur="3.899">especially when now that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="702.939" dur="5.46">purchasing corporate bonds and they</text>
  <text start="705.519" dur="5.401">already have about what 1.1 trillion out</text>
