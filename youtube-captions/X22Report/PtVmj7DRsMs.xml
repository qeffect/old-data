  <text start="82.729" dur="8.431">again they don&amp;#39;t want anyone looking at</text>
  <text start="85.79" dur="8.07">those type of systems or looking at gold</text>
  <text start="91.16" dur="6.03">and silver or looking at anything that</text>
  <text start="93.86" dur="4.8">might go up against the fiat system they</text>
  <text start="97.19" dur="3.66">don&amp;#39;t want that to happen but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="98.66" dur="4.2">seeing a lot of financial firms we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="102.86" dur="4.44">lot of venture capital firms look at</text>
  <text start="105.38" dur="3.36">cryptocurrency because they see that</text>
  <text start="107.3" dur="3.06">there is something there now even</text>

  <text start="110.36" dur="3.149">desk we know JP Morgan has a trading</text>
  <text start="111.86" dur="4.289">desk because they want to be on both</text>
  <text start="113.509" dur="4.801">sides they understand that something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="116.149" dur="4.321">going to change and they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="118.31" dur="4.83">be left out in the cold so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="120.47" dur="4.53">making sure that they have a Foothill</text>
  <text start="123.14" dur="3.75">over here and afoot over here to make</text>
  <text start="125" dur="5.34">sure that they&amp;#39;re covering all their</text>
  <text start="126.89" dur="6.24">bases and again if we do or when we do</text>
  <text start="130.34" dur="4.29">go to the crypto realm I don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="133.13" dur="3.48">we need any of these financial</text>
  <text start="134.63" dur="4.35">institutions there&amp;#39;s no reason for them</text>
  <text start="136.61" dur="5.52">but once again they&amp;#39;re gonna try to make</text>
  <text start="138.98" dur="4.74">a reason why they need to exist but what</text>
  <text start="142.13" dur="4.38">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is billionaire</text>
  <text start="143.72" dur="5.73">Peter Thiel his venture capital firm is</text>
  <text start="146.51" dur="5.1">investing a start-up designed to</text>
  <text start="149.45" dur="5.819">optimize block trading for major</text>
  <text start="151.61" dur="7.23">cryptocurrency market participants the</text>
  <text start="155.269" dur="5.94">investment has been revealed and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="158.84" dur="6.81">the founders fund itself has already</text>
  <text start="161.209" dur="6.78">made a monster bet on Bitcoin it also</text>
  <text start="165.65" dur="4.38">confirms that feels bullish view on</text>
  <text start="167.989" dur="4.441">Bitcoin reported in October last year</text>
  <text start="170.03" dur="5.07">when the billionaire investor argued</text>
  <text start="172.43" dur="6.33">that critics of Bitcoin were under</text>
  <text start="175.1" dur="6.96">estimating the cryptocurrency he went on</text>
  <text start="178.76" dur="5.849">to say if Bitcoin ends up being the</text>
  <text start="182.06" dur="4.32">cyber equivalent of gold and it has a</text>
  <text start="184.609" dur="4.141">great potential left</text>
  <text start="186.38" dur="5.19">and it&amp;#39;s very different kind of thing</text>
  <text start="188.75" dur="4.8">from what people in Silicon Valley focus</text>
  <text start="191.57" dur="6.36">on companies not algorithms not</text>
  <text start="193.55" dur="7.28">protocols but this might be maybe one</text>
  <text start="197.93" dur="6.21">exemption that is very underestimated</text>
  <text start="200.83" dur="6.13">the objections that people have to</text>
  <text start="204.14" dur="5.61">Bitcoin are also objections to gold</text>
  <text start="206.96" dur="5.76">it&amp;#39;s this weird currency that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="209.75" dur="6.69">backed by any government same thing is</text>
  <text start="212.72" dur="6.42">true of gold and first of all who cares</text>
  <text start="216.44" dur="6.62">if it&amp;#39;s backed up by government if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="219.14" dur="7.23">backed up by the people if the people</text>
  <text start="223.06" dur="5.68">believe it&amp;#39;s worth something then it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="226.37" dur="5.79">worth something I mean he even went on</text>
  <text start="228.74" dur="5.49">to say if everyone decided that $100</text>
  <text start="232.16" dur="3.51">bill was worthless then you wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="234.23" dur="3.96">want to have $100 bill</text>
  <text start="235.67" dur="4.71">that&amp;#39;s absolutely right if we all got</text>
  <text start="238.19" dur="3.66">together and we looked at the paper</text>
  <text start="240.38" dur="3.93">currency the Federal Reserve Note and</text>
  <text start="241.85" dur="4.32">the entire country and the world said</text>
  <text start="244.31" dur="3.57">listen we don&amp;#39;t believe this is worth</text>
  <text start="246.17" dur="3.63">anything we&amp;#39;re not gonna be trading it</text>
  <text start="247.88" dur="4.62">anymore what would happen to it</text>
  <text start="249.8" dur="6.21">it would be worthless no one would deal</text>
  <text start="252.5" dur="4.7">in it no one would use it that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="256.01" dur="6.36">that works</text>
  <text start="257.2" dur="7.84">now we can see that these individuals</text>
  <text start="262.37" dur="5.25">understand what is coming they</text>
  <text start="265.04" dur="3.54">understand that things are about to</text>
  <text start="267.62" dur="4.29">change</text>
  <text start="268.58" dur="5.79">and I do believe the central banks</text>
  <text start="271.91" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re gonna be fighting all the way</text>
  <text start="274.37" dur="7.02">down until the central banks are</text>
  <text start="276.53" dur="7.44">completely obsolete and from what I see</text>
  <text start="281.39" dur="4.68">from what I see coming I think the</text>
  <text start="283.97" dur="5.49">central banks they&amp;#39;re on their last leg</text>
  <text start="286.07" dur="6.03">and they will become obsolete unless</text>
  <text start="289.46" dur="5.88">something major changes but we&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="292.1" dur="5.94">that course right now now the economy in</text>
  <text start="295.34" dur="5.7">the United States is continually</text>
  <text start="298.04" dur="4.83">declining nothing&amp;#39;s changed here the</text>
  <text start="301.04" dur="4.65">statistics that they&amp;#39;ve been using since</text>
  <text start="302.87" dur="5.49">2008 prior to 2008 where they even</text>
  <text start="305.69" dur="5.48">manipulated past 2008 everything&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="308.36" dur="5.28">same nothing has changed whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="311.17" dur="5.28">what is Trump what Trump is doing right</text>
  <text start="313.64" dur="6.15">now he&amp;#39;s using what was given to him to</text>
  <text start="316.45" dur="4.9">push the economy to the edge</text>
  <text start="319.79" dur="5.16">and I&amp;#39;m gonna show you in a little bit</text>
  <text start="321.35" dur="6.36">how the corporate media the Fed the</text>
  <text start="324.95" dur="6">establishment how they&amp;#39;re trying to gain</text>
  <text start="327.71" dur="5.55">the narrative and how they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="330.95" dur="3.87">ready to push their agenda and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="333.26" dur="5.07">doing it very slowly right now and</text>
  <text start="334.82" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re trying to make their case of why</text>
  <text start="338.33" dur="4.29">certain things are about to happen</text>
  <text start="340.31" dur="3.99">but if we look at US factory orders they</text>
  <text start="342.62" dur="4.79">rose by one point six percent month a</text>
  <text start="344.3" dur="6.78">month in March and they were revised up</text>
  <text start="347.41" dur="5.92">to one point six so that means they were</text>
  <text start="351.08" dur="6">much lower now if we look at factory</text>
  <text start="353.33" dur="8.25">orders year-on-year we see a pattern</text>
  <text start="357.08" dur="6.15">here and if we look in the year of 2014</text>
  <text start="361.58" dur="6.05">going into 2015</text>
  <text start="363.23" dur="8.57">factory orders drop to the lowest point</text>
  <text start="367.63" dur="8.32">since 2001 I mean it was only lower in</text>
  <text start="371.8" dur="7.15">2008 and back then during that low</text>
  <text start="375.95" dur="4.47">period of 2001 we were in a recession if</text>
  <text start="378.95" dur="6.14">we all the way if we go all the way back</text>
  <text start="380.42" dur="7.25">to the 90s it wasn&amp;#39;t as low as it was in</text>
  <text start="385.09" dur="5.77">2014-2015 and we were in a recession</text>
  <text start="387.67" dur="6.13">2008 it was really really low and we</text>
  <text start="390.86" dur="6.39">were in a recession and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="393.8" dur="6.33">seeing right now is that it was pushed</text>
  <text start="397.25" dur="5.55">up and it looks like we&amp;#39;re heading to</text>
  <text start="400.13" dur="4.71">that point where we are going to be</text>
  <text start="402.8" dur="4.89">heading into a recession because we hit</text>
  <text start="404.84" dur="5.31">the top we are now coming down we also</text>
  <text start="407.69" dur="5.25">see capital good shipments they also</text>
  <text start="410.15" dur="4.29">have dropped and when we start to look</text>
  <text start="412.94" dur="3.39">at all this we start to see that all</text>
  <text start="414.44" dur="4.59">these different indicators are showing</text>
  <text start="416.33" dur="6.42">us that we are either in a recession or</text>
  <text start="419.03" dur="7.38">headed towards a huge depression and</text>
  <text start="422.75" dur="7.29">that is the collapse of the economy we</text>
  <text start="426.41" dur="5.94">see US worker productivity well that has</text>
  <text start="430.04" dur="4.92">been revised lower that is dropping the</text>
  <text start="432.35" dur="6.33">you the unit labor costs urine year has</text>
  <text start="434.96" dur="6.72">dropped and this is the second time in a</text>
  <text start="438.68" dur="5.76">row that this has happened and what</text>
  <text start="441.68" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that all these</text>
  <text start="444.44" dur="5.9">different indicators that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="445.91" dur="7.53">looking at factory orders durable goods</text>
  <text start="450.34" dur="7">inflation the subprime the link</text>
  <text start="453.44" dur="7.98">Quincy rate the Fannie Mae where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="457.34" dur="7.44">lowering the requirements of getting a</text>
  <text start="461.42" dur="5.4">mortgage they&amp;#39;re doing all of this and</text>
  <text start="464.78" dur="5.03">all this is being manipulated and</text>
  <text start="466.82" dur="5.37">changed to keep this entire system</text>
  <text start="469.81" dur="5.92">afloat that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re doing all this</text>
  <text start="472.19" dur="6.36">if you go back to 2008 and you look</text>
  <text start="475.73" dur="4.83">prior to 2008 you could see that they</text>
  <text start="478.55" dur="4.98">were bringing in subprime people into</text>
  <text start="480.56" dur="6.33">the housing arena they knew the subprime</text>
  <text start="483.53" dur="5.61">securities were complete garbage they</text>
  <text start="486.89" dur="5.19">were bringing them in putting them into</text>
  <text start="489.14" dur="5.4">these subprime securities wrapping it up</text>
  <text start="492.08" dur="3.87">and basically selling it to pensions and</text>
  <text start="494.54" dur="4.77">things like that for to have to have</text>
  <text start="495.95" dur="5.72">them invest in it we also see the same</text>
  <text start="499.31" dur="5.55">thing happened in the automobile market</text>
  <text start="501.67" dur="6.31">credit was out there people were just</text>
  <text start="504.86" dur="5.22">you know in debt up to their eyeballs</text>
  <text start="507.98" dur="5.999">people were taking home equity line of</text>
  <text start="510.08" dur="6.81">credit on their houses to buy certain</text>
  <text start="513.979" dur="3.81">things or to improve their homes because</text>
  <text start="516.89" dur="3.029">they thought they were gonna get a lot</text>
  <text start="517.789" dur="4.261">more money for because real estate never</text>
  <text start="519.919" dur="3.87">goes down and what was happening during</text>
  <text start="522.05" dur="3.42">this period but the stock market and</text>
  <text start="523.789" dur="4.711">everything else they were bringing in</text>
  <text start="525.47" dur="6.6">everyone they possibly could into the</text>
  <text start="528.5" dur="6.18">system and those people who pumped it up</text>
  <text start="532.07" dur="4.5">that knew the insider information that</text>
  <text start="534.68" dur="4.95">knew what was gonna happen they were</text>
  <text start="536.57" dur="4.98">getting out this is what was happening</text>
  <text start="539.63" dur="5.43">during this period of time and the Fed</text>
  <text start="541.55" dur="4.89">knew and those in power knew that they</text>
  <text start="545.06" dur="3.21">were going to have to bail out these</text>
  <text start="546.44" dur="3.66">corporations that he knew they were</text>
  <text start="548.27" dur="3.06">gonna have to get a bailout they knew</text>
  <text start="550.1" dur="3.33">they were gonna be able to purchase the</text>
  <text start="551.33" dur="3.54">toxic real estate they knew they were</text>
  <text start="553.43" dur="4.14">gonna have to do all these things this</text>
  <text start="554.87" dur="4.68">wasn&amp;#39;t a surprise to them they knew what</text>
  <text start="557.57" dur="4.53">was happening they&amp;#39;re the ones who</text>
  <text start="559.55" dur="5.97">created it the same thing is happening</text>
  <text start="562.1" dur="5.64">right now and yesterday we showed how</text>
  <text start="565.52" dur="4.11">the corporate media is out there and</text>
  <text start="567.74" dur="3.599">they&amp;#39;re saying that the economy is not</text>
  <text start="569.63" dur="5.459">doing that great it&amp;#39;s the same exact</text>
  <text start="571.339" dur="5.941">economy when Obama came into office and</text>
  <text start="575.089" dur="4.201">they told us that this is an incredible</text>
  <text start="577.28" dur="3.78">economy we&amp;#39;re in a recovery everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="579.29" dur="4.41">getting better the economy really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="581.06" dur="5.37">change we didn&amp;#39;t open up more plants</text>
  <text start="583.7" dur="3.36">here we didn&amp;#39;t do anything differently</text>
  <text start="586.43" dur="2.85">here</text>
  <text start="587.06" dur="4.5">everything is exactly the same actually</text>
  <text start="589.28" dur="4.47">the calculations everything that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="591.56" dur="4.32">used in the past is exactly the same</text>
  <text start="593.75" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re adding the same am actually more</text>
  <text start="595.88" dur="5.4">debt now so we&amp;#39;re doing the same things</text>
  <text start="598.25" dur="6.81">nothing&amp;#39;s changed and the reason for</text>
  <text start="601.28" dur="5.58">this is Trump is using their system to</text>
  <text start="605.06" dur="4.02">push it to the edge to gain the</text>
  <text start="606.86" dur="6.57">narrative to show this was your system</text>
  <text start="609.08" dur="5.58">the Fed was driving the economy now what</text>
  <text start="613.43" dur="3.3">the Fed is doing and what the</text>
  <text start="614.66" dur="3.96">establishment is doing they&amp;#39;re turning</text>
  <text start="616.73" dur="4.65">this around now in Bloomberg there was</text>
  <text start="618.62" dur="8.1">an article called the title is the Fed</text>
  <text start="621.38" dur="7.95">is on shifting ground and ago and the</text>
  <text start="626.72" dur="5.1">first line is the biggest short-term</text>
  <text start="629.33" dur="5.34">threat to the US economy comes from</text>
  <text start="631.82" dur="6.87">president Trump&amp;#39;s dangerous maneuvers on</text>
  <text start="634.67" dur="6">trade not the Federal Reserve monetary</text>
  <text start="638.69" dur="5.7">policy so they&amp;#39;re making it very clear</text>
  <text start="640.67" dur="6.06">that it&amp;#39;s because of Trump that that is</text>
  <text start="644.39" dur="5.52">the biggest threat to the economy not</text>
  <text start="646.73" dur="5.97">the Federal Reserve and went on to say</text>
  <text start="649.91" dur="5.45">but knowing this doesn&amp;#39;t much help the</text>
  <text start="652.7" dur="5.04">Fed do its job which is getting more</text>
  <text start="655.36" dur="4.96">complicated for reasons closer to home</text>
  <text start="657.74" dur="4.77">the outlook for inflation is shifting</text>
  <text start="660.32" dur="3.9">and Fed officials are wondering how to</text>
  <text start="662.51" dur="4.83">respond what they&amp;#39;re really saying is</text>
  <text start="664.22" dur="4.83">okay we need to gain the narrative on</text>
  <text start="667.34" dur="4.23">the economy because we could see what</text>
  <text start="669.05" dur="6">Trump is doing now this is a game that</text>
  <text start="671.57" dur="5.01">is being played here and they understand</text>
  <text start="675.05" dur="3.87">that they have to shift this is why I</text>
  <text start="676.58" dur="4.83">believe they might not even raise</text>
  <text start="678.92" dur="3.84">interest rates right now because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="681.41" dur="2.61">waiting to see what Trump&amp;#39;s gonna do</text>
  <text start="682.76" dur="2.46">Trump&amp;#39;s waiting to see what the feds</text>
  <text start="684.02" dur="3.72">going to do because both of them are</text>

  <text start="687.74" dur="4.74">and gain the narrative and this is why</text>
  <text start="690.5" dur="6.96">the Fed is saying we might have to shift</text>
  <text start="692.48" dur="8.25">and change things up to gain this</text>
  <text start="697.46" dur="5.91">narrative and they&amp;#39;re already pushing</text>
  <text start="700.73" dur="4.47">the blame onto Trump this is the whole</text>
  <text start="703.37" dur="3.72">thing and you&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot more</text>
  <text start="705.2" dur="4.11">articles come out and you&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="707.09" dur="5.64">it on CNN you&amp;#39;re gonna start to see it</text>
  <text start="709.31" dur="5.4">on ABC NBC CBS all the news stations</text>
  <text start="712.73" dur="4.38">very soon where they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="714.71" dur="4.59">economy is not doing well this is the</text>
  <text start="717.11" dur="3.48">reasons they&amp;#39;re going to talk about most</text>
  <text start="719.3" dur="3.27">likely manipulation</text>
  <text start="720.59" dur="4.17">these numbers aren&amp;#39;t the real numbers</text>
  <text start="722.57" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re gonna start to make the case of</text>
  <text start="724.76" dur="4.5">why this stuff isn&amp;#39;t real now of course</text>
  <text start="727.22" dur="3.39">what Trump is going to do he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="729.26" dur="3.15">turn it around saying listen I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="730.61" dur="3.48">changed thing here these were the same</text>
  <text start="732.41" dur="4.71">exact calculations these were the same</text>
  <text start="734.09" dur="6.51">exact numbers this is exactly what Obama</text>
  <text start="737.12" dur="6.09">was doing from the beginning and the Fed</text>
  <text start="740.6" dur="4.17">was relying on this data I believe this</text>
  <text start="743.21" dur="4.8">is why he hasn&amp;#39;t changed anything</text>
  <text start="744.77" dur="7.8">because he wants to use this against</text>
  <text start="748.01" dur="7.23">them he&amp;#39;s going to trap them in what</text>
  <text start="752.57" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;ve done in the past and what is</text>
  <text start="755.24" dur="4.35">being done in the present and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="757.34" dur="5.07">being done in the future he&amp;#39;s gonna use</text>
  <text start="759.59" dur="4.74">all of this and they&amp;#39;re going to show</text>
  <text start="762.41" dur="3.15">that this is what has been done and I</text>
  <text start="764.33" dur="3.21">believe this is when they&amp;#39;re gonna bring</text>
  <text start="765.56" dur="4.89">in the audit bill he&amp;#39;s gonna sign off on</text>
  <text start="767.54" dur="5.64">it and we&amp;#39;re gonna have the Fed audit it</text>
  <text start="770.45" dur="5.01">because once the system starts to break</text>
  <text start="773.18" dur="4.38">down when when people start to scream in</text>
  <text start="775.46" dur="3.72">yell and people are very upset because</text>
  <text start="777.56" dur="4.65">they lost their jobs they lost their</text>
  <text start="779.18" dur="5.1">wealth and whatnot they&amp;#39;re gonna want</text>
  <text start="782.21" dur="3.99">something to be done here they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="784.28" dur="5.25">want to point fingers at something and</text>
  <text start="786.2" dur="4.86">this is the best time to point the</text>
  <text start="789.53" dur="3.87">fingers at the Fed to say wait a minute</text>
