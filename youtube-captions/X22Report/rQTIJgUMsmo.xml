  <text start="111.27" dur="3.75">that is what they&amp;#39;re doing at this point</text>
  <text start="113.429" dur="3.51">we look at the real economic indicators</text>

  <text start="130.259" dur="3.661">if we go back to 2015</text>
  <text start="131.4" dur="4.59">there are thousands upon thousands of</text>
  <text start="133.92" dur="4.44">jobs that have been lost actually if we</text>
  <text start="135.99" dur="4.2">go back to June of 2014 and we look at</text>
  <text start="138.36" dur="4.23">challenger gray and Christmas which</text>

  <text start="146.79" dur="7.22">jobs that have been laid off up until</text>
  <text start="149.819" dur="7.981">this point this is how bad it has gotten</text>

  <text start="157.8" dur="3.3">central bank the US government they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="160.05" dur="3.51">trying to convince you that everything</text>

  <text start="171.84" dur="5.4">losing the high paid full-time jobs</text>
  <text start="174.42" dur="5.67">that&amp;#39;s meaningless all we&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="177.24" dur="4.8">counting those people that are working</text>
  <text start="180.09" dur="4.38">and if they&amp;#39;re not working we just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="182.04" dur="5.22">care about you and this is what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="184.47" dur="5.04">been doing all along now we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="187.26" dur="5.43">to see the housing market which is a</text>
  <text start="189.51" dur="5.16">bubble it&amp;#39;s starting to pop and for the</text>
  <text start="192.69" dur="4.17">first time since April of 2014</text>
  <text start="194.67" dur="6.39">new home sales have fallen year and year</text>
  <text start="196.86" dur="6.86">for two consecutive months we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="201.06" dur="4.98">a 6.1 percent drop in February</text>
  <text start="203.72" dur="6.73">year-on-year this is the biggest annual</text>
  <text start="206.04" dur="10.16">drop since June of 2014 and confirms</text>
  <text start="210.45" dur="8.46">right now that the housing data is weak</text>
  <text start="216.2" dur="4.69">because we&amp;#39;re seeing new home prices</text>
  <text start="218.91" dur="4.41">they fell to three hundred and forty</text>
  <text start="220.89" dur="7.31">eight thousand the lowest since August</text>
  <text start="223.32" dur="10.23">the housing recovery is non-existent</text>
  <text start="228.2" dur="8.08">northeast down 24% Midwest down 17%</text>
  <text start="233.55" dur="5.7">south down negative four point one</text>
  <text start="236.28" dur="8.1">percent it is all tumbling and falling</text>
  <text start="239.25" dur="8.07">apart annual growth right now for new</text>
  <text start="244.38" dur="6.96">home sales is collapsing existing home</text>
  <text start="247.32" dur="9.38">sales have been collapsing home prices</text>
  <text start="251.34" dur="9.69">have been declining and this feeds into</text>
  <text start="256.7" dur="6.49">everything because when people have jobs</text>
  <text start="261.03" dur="3.48">they have strong jobs and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="263.19" dur="4.44">comfortable in their jobs they feel</text>
  <text start="264.51" dur="4.59">secure they have no problem going out</text>
  <text start="267.63" dur="4.86">and purchasing a home and taking out a</text>
  <text start="269.1" dur="6.319">loan but when they don&amp;#39;t feel secure</text>
  <text start="272.49" dur="5.61">when they&amp;#39;re not bringing in the income</text>
  <text start="275.419" dur="5.381">the American person is not going to go</text>
  <text start="278.1" dur="6.24">out and purchase a home if a college</text>
  <text start="280.8" dur="6.03">graduate graduates college and can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="284.34" dur="4.829">find a job and has student loan debt and</text>
  <text start="286.83" dur="5.37">only can find a part-time job and has to</text>
  <text start="289.169" dur="7.591">live with their parents they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="292.2" dur="5.88">going out to purchase a home and this is</text>
  <text start="296.76" dur="1.62">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now mortgage</text>
  <text start="298.08" dur="3.2">Apple</text>
  <text start="298.38" dur="7.23">occations they&amp;#39;re down by 3.3%</text>
  <text start="301.28" dur="9.01">refinancing is down 5% and refinance</text>
  <text start="305.61" dur="8.13">volume was 4.5% lower than the same week</text>
  <text start="310.29" dur="7.92">one year ago this is coming from the</text>
  <text start="313.74" dur="7.35">Mortgage Bankers Association what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="318.21" dur="4.53">seeing at this point is the corporate</text>
  <text start="321.09" dur="3.48">media the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="322.74" dur="7.92">trying to convince us that this is</text>
  <text start="324.57" dur="8.91">normal this is how a recovery this is</text>
  <text start="330.66" dur="5.07">what a recovery looks like this is not</text>
  <text start="333.48" dur="5.76">what a recovery looks like this is a</text>
  <text start="335.73" dur="5.76">complete disaster now we see the bowl to</text>
  <text start="339.24" dur="4.97">dry index it hit 401 it&amp;#39;s up three</text>
  <text start="341.49" dur="5.49">points once again this is still</text>
  <text start="344.21" dur="4.99">absolutely awful it&amp;#39;s creeping up very</text>
  <text start="346.98" dur="4.32">slowly and when I expect that it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="349.2" dur="5.7">to come right back down again because</text>
  <text start="351.3" dur="7.08">you have to remember people still need</text>
  <text start="354.9" dur="5.46">things factories will continue to</text>
  <text start="358.38" dur="4.89">produce probably not at the volume they</text>
  <text start="360.36" dur="4.86">were producing but people run out of</text>
  <text start="363.27" dur="4.05">things stores do run out of things</text>
  <text start="365.22" dur="5.85">people still have to purchase certain</text>
  <text start="367.32" dur="6.33">items so we will see a tick up of the</text>
  <text start="371.07" dur="5.36">Baltic Dry Index we will also see</text>
  <text start="373.65" dur="4.92">factories produce and once they produce</text>
  <text start="376.43" dur="4.78">whatever little they need to produce</text>
  <text start="378.57" dur="4.8">that&amp;#39;s it and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="381.21" dur="4.11">at this point but of course what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="383.37" dur="3.09">to happen is the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="385.32" dur="1.95">central banks they&amp;#39;re going to call this</text>
  <text start="386.46" dur="3.17">the new normal</text>
  <text start="387.27" dur="5.04">well this is what a recovery looks like</text>
  <text start="389.63" dur="4.93">we used to have incredible manufacturing</text>
  <text start="392.31" dur="4.56">but this is the new normal where there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.56" dur="3.57">very little manufacturing and as we move</text>
  <text start="396.87" dur="3.15">into the summer months what we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="398.13" dur="5.1">to see is manufacturing the Baltic Dry</text>
  <text start="400.02" dur="10.2">Index most likely slide back down into</text>
  <text start="403.23" dur="9.92">nothing and we realize that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="410.22" dur="6.78">impossible for the economy to improve</text>
  <text start="413.15" dur="5.77">out of nowhere as more and more people</text>
  <text start="417" dur="4.2">get laid off means more and more people</text>
  <text start="418.92" dur="3.69">are not going to be on shopping they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="421.2" dur="3.54">not going to be purchasing their goods</text>
  <text start="422.61" dur="5.04">and retail that means you don&amp;#39;t need the</text>
  <text start="424.74" dur="5.82">employees in retail they&amp;#39;ll be laying</text>
  <text start="427.65" dur="4.5">off stores will be closing factories</text>
  <text start="430.56" dur="5.25">will not produce the volume</text>
  <text start="432.15" dur="8.01">drop they won&amp;#39;t need to order the raw</text>
  <text start="435.81" dur="7.08">materials and this cycle continues and</text>
  <text start="440.16" dur="5.85">this is what is continually happening at</text>
  <text start="442.89" dur="6.27">this point we&amp;#39;re seeing that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="446.01" dur="9.6">mining industry they have lost more</text>
  <text start="449.16" dur="11.28">money this year then it made in the</text>
  <text start="455.61" dur="9.96">prior eight years this is how bad it is</text>
  <text start="460.44" dur="8.25">gotten the biggest ever collapse in</text>

  <text start="501.36" dur="6">fourth quarter from here earlier which</text>

  <text start="542.73" dur="4.77">accelerating at this point and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="545.7" dur="4.91">nothing the US government the central</text>
  <text start="547.5" dur="7.8">bankers can do to cover this up anymore</text>
  <text start="550.61" dur="7.33">it&amp;#39;s becoming too apparent everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="555.3" dur="5.19">realizing what&amp;#39;s really going on here</text>
  <text start="557.94" dur="7.459">and this is when their illusion starts</text>
  <text start="560.49" dur="6.98">to fall apart when everyone see</text>
