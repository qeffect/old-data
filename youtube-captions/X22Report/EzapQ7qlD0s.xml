  <text start="244.72" dur="5.37">do are not making enough and not saving</text>
  <text start="248.079" dur="4.231">their money because they don&amp;#39;t have</text>

  <text start="286.84" dur="6.57">countries we are seeing this occur the</text>
  <text start="290.41" dur="5.73">same way it happened in 2008 but this</text>
  <text start="293.41" dur="5.76">time it is much much worse why because</text>
  <text start="296.14" dur="5.28">we have more unemployment we have more</text>
  <text start="299.17" dur="4.71">debt and the government&amp;#39;s are</text>
  <text start="301.42" dur="6.03">continually pushing austerity on the</text>
  <text start="303.88" dur="5.58">people cutting programs and taking on</text>

  <text start="312.28" dur="4.98">help out with the revenue and all of</text>
  <text start="314.5" dur="6.6">this cannot be sustained it will</text>
  <text start="317.26" dur="5.94">eventually come crashing down now here</text>
  <text start="321.1" dur="4.94">in the United States of course they can</text>
  <text start="323.2" dur="6.51">manipulate pump up numbers and</text>

  <text start="332.47" dur="4.71">interesting the debt Dallas Fed surge</text>
  <text start="334.3" dur="5.67">the dallas fed manufacturing search</text>
  <text start="337.18" dur="5.19">through seven-month high right now but</text>
  <text start="339.97" dur="6.21">what&amp;#39;s more interesting is that the job</text>
  <text start="342.37" dur="8.04">outlook tumbled to the lowest in 2014</text>
  <text start="346.18" dur="7.92">and we&amp;#39;re seeing that the expectation</text>
  <text start="350.41" dur="8.4">index for employment it is dropped to</text>
  <text start="354.1" dur="7.29">the lowest since december of 2013 so we</text>

  <text start="368.53" dur="5.46">expectation for employees dropped to its</text>
  <text start="370.33" dur="7.23">lowest point since 2014 so we are having</text>
  <text start="373.99" dur="7.92">a huge huge problem we do not see jobs</text>
  <text start="377.56" dur="6.09">coming through to the private sector</text>
  <text start="381.91" dur="3.15">right now they&amp;#39;re not seeing this</text>
  <text start="383.65" dur="2.79">actually what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a lot of</text>

  <text start="427.179" dur="4.931">patting ourselves on the back this is</text>
  <text start="430.189" dur="4.29">the little pop I was talking about</text>
  <text start="432.11" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re going to see a little pop during</text>
  <text start="434.479" dur="3.33">the spring and may be going into the</text>
  <text start="436.61" dur="3.569">first part of the summer because you</text>
  <text start="437.809" dur="4.5">have to remember they&amp;#39;re giving they</text>

  <text start="449.479" dur="6.66">saw signs when I was driving by</text>
  <text start="452.36" dur="6.989">developments and we&amp;#39;re also seeing that</text>
  <text start="456.139" dur="5.161">they are giving to subprime borrowers at</text>
  <text start="459.349" dur="5.46">this time so we&amp;#39;re repeating what</text>
  <text start="461.3" dur="5.339">happened back in 2006-2007 leading the</text>
  <text start="464.809" dur="3.51">2008 they&amp;#39;re also doing adjustable rate</text>
  <text start="466.639" dur="3.63">mortgages so we&amp;#39;re going to see this</text>
  <text start="468.319" dur="3.93">little pop because normally the spring</text>
  <text start="470.269" dur="3.721">and summer is when we do have the pop</text>
  <text start="472.249" dur="3.54">and of course they&amp;#39;re going to call it a</text>
  <text start="473.99" dur="4.079">recovery it&amp;#39;s almost like during the</text>
  <text start="475.789" dur="4.73">holiday season when everyone hires those</text>
  <text start="478.069" dur="5.041">part-time people and they say oh my god</text>
  <text start="480.519" dur="4.841">employment so much better yeah but this</text>
  <text start="483.11" dur="4.409">is temporary part-time work and they use</text>
  <text start="485.36" dur="4.829">this to their advantage to say that</text>
  <text start="487.519" dur="4.471">employment is really getting better and</text>
  <text start="490.189" dur="4.38">they never tell you that oh yeah it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="491.99" dur="4.5">only part-time it&amp;#39;s only temporary all</text>
  <text start="494.569" dur="4.32">these jobs will be lost come the end of</text>
  <text start="496.49" dur="5.879">January we&amp;#39;re seeing the same thing here</text>
  <text start="498.889" dur="5.76">this is a small little pop and if we</text>
  <text start="502.369" dur="4.62">really look at the facts and the figures</text>
  <text start="504.649" dur="3.99">of what is going on here they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="506.989" dur="3.75">that pending sales are up by three point</text>
  <text start="508.639" dur="4.32">four percent from februari but if we</text>
  <text start="510.739" dur="4.47">look at the broader picture here pending</text>
  <text start="512.959" dur="5.55">sales are down seven point nine percent</text>
  <text start="515.209" dur="5.161">from a year ago how could that be more</text>
  <text start="518.509" dur="3.241">people have jobs right because the</text>
  <text start="520.37" dur="2.939">unemployment came down to six point</text>
  <text start="521.75" dur="3.36">seven percent they&amp;#39;re telling us that</text>
  <text start="523.309" dur="3.361">more people are working now they should</text>
  <text start="525.11" dur="3.269">be saving more money and they should be</text>
  <text start="526.67" dur="3.63">buying houses but we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="528.379" dur="5.07">pending sales are down seven point nine</text>
  <text start="530.3" dur="7.08">percent from last year index</text>
  <text start="533.449" dur="7.101">two-point-six percent below 2001 level</text>
  <text start="537.38" dur="4.29">and the actual new home sales are down</text>
  <text start="540.55" dur="3.73">for</text>
  <text start="541.67" dur="4.98">10.5 percent so they can pat themselves</text>
  <text start="544.28" dur="5.04">on the back saying that we&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="546.65" dur="5.94">housing recovery that it&amp;#39;s going to boom</text>
  <text start="549.32" dur="5.7">I&amp;#39;m saying this is a small little pop</text>
  <text start="552.59" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s going to go absolutely nowhere and</text>
  <text start="555.02" dur="4.59">as we go through the summer it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="556.94" dur="5.13">to continually decline decline decline</text>
  <text start="559.61" dur="4.05">and they already know this because we</text>
  <text start="562.07" dur="4.23">have to take into account what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="563.66" dur="5.55">already done they laid off tens of</text>
  <text start="566.3" dur="4.26">thousands of people in Wells Fargo and</text>
  <text start="569.21" dur="4.65">this is in their mortgage departments</text>
  <text start="570.56" dur="6">Wells Fargo JPMorgan Chase Citibank Bank</text>
  <text start="573.86" dur="4.83">of America they laid off all of these</text>
  <text start="576.56" dur="3.54">people because they realize the American</text>
  <text start="578.69" dur="3.48">people will not be taking out these</text>
  <text start="580.1" dur="4.35">mortgages what else are we seeing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="582.17" dur="4.95">seeing major mortgage companies</text>
  <text start="584.45" dur="5.25">completely closing because they&amp;#39;re set</text>
  <text start="587.12" dur="4.62">the sails out there are not out there</text>
  <text start="589.7" dur="4.62">anymore because the people do not have</text>
  <text start="591.74" dur="5.16">work if they are working they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="594.32" dur="4.59">working at the high level high salary</text>
  <text start="596.9" dur="5.22">jobs there at the lower level right now</text>
  <text start="598.91" dur="6.06">and even some people are at the working</text>
  <text start="602.12" dur="5.16">part time jobs maybe 12 part time jobs</text>
  <text start="604.97" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;re also seeing that the Fed has not</text>
  <text start="607.28" dur="4.74">stopped pumping in billions of dollars</text>
  <text start="609.77" dur="4.86">into the banks to buy up their toxic</text>
  <text start="612.02" dur="5.16">real estate they&amp;#39;re also channeling</text>
  <text start="614.63" dur="5.28">money to Belgium to pick up the</text>
  <text start="617.18" dur="5.28">purchases of the Treasury bonds so the</text>
  <text start="619.91" dur="4.26">taper is really not a taper they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="622.46" dur="4.29">still doing what they&amp;#39;ve always been</text>
  <text start="624.17" dur="5.4">doing they just manipulated of how</text>
  <text start="626.75" dur="5.28">people are seeing this money and where</text>
  <text start="629.57" dur="3.84">this money is actually traveling to to</text>
  <text start="632.03" dur="2.97">take up the slack and they&amp;#39;re not</text>

  <text start="832.399" dur="5.1">back to Europe and to the United States</text>
  <text start="835.039" dur="4.38">and bring the economy&amp;#39;s down and this is</text>
  <text start="837.499" dur="4.26">why they haven&amp;#39;t been doing it now</text>
  <text start="839.419" dur="4.65">Goldman Sachs which this is very</text>
  <text start="841.759" dur="4.56">interesting here I don&amp;#39;t know if you</text>
  <text start="844.069" dur="5.19">remember this buyer i reported this back</text>
  <text start="846.319" dur="5.55">in april of 2013 goldman came out back</text>
  <text start="849.259" dur="4.5">then and told everyone to sell their</text>
  <text start="851.869" dur="6.3">gold because gold prices were going to</text>
  <text start="853.759" dur="6.93">drop as people were selling their gold</text>
  <text start="858.169" dur="5.31">and the price was dropping Goldman</text>
  <text start="860.689" dur="4.95">waited waited waited and they waited to</text>
  <text start="863.479" dur="4.8">the lowest level and they purchased all</text>
  <text start="865.639" dur="5.88">the gold that they told the people to</text>
  <text start="868.279" dur="5.25">sell what they&amp;#39;re doing now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="871.519" dur="6.42">telling their clients to sell their</text>
  <text start="873.529" dur="6.09">Treasury bonds very interesting now it</text>
  <text start="877.939" dur="4.47">could be that they want to take control</text>
  <text start="879.619" dur="4.29">of the Treasury bonds and hold them they</text>
  <text start="882.409" dur="3.51">would like their clients to sell them</text>
  <text start="883.909" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;d like to take them and hold them</text>
  <text start="885.919" dur="4.02">because they&amp;#39;re very nervous the Fed is</text>
  <text start="887.869" dur="3.57">very nervous the US government is very</text>
  <text start="889.939" dur="3.18">nervous that people might be selling</text>
  <text start="891.439" dur="4.32">their Treasury bonds so they want</text>
  <text start="893.119" dur="5.16">Goldman to purchase them up and hold</text>
  <text start="895.759" dur="5.19">them or there could be another reason</text>
  <text start="898.279" dur="4.86">why this is happening but it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="900.949" dur="4.29">interesting that every time Goldman</text>
  <text start="903.139" dur="4.14">comes out and tells people to do</text>
  <text start="905.239" dur="3.81">something it&amp;#39;s usually for an opposite</text>
  <text start="907.279" dur="3.84">reason just like our government</text>
  <text start="909.049" dur="4.17">officials it&amp;#39;s usually the opposite</text>
  <text start="911.119" dur="4.44">reason and we understand that Russia</text>
  <text start="913.219" dur="4.83">China and other foreign nations have</text>
  <text start="915.559" dur="4.44">been dumping their Treasury bonds right</text>
  <text start="918.049" dur="4.08">now Belgium is picking up the slack</text>
  <text start="919.999" dur="4.59">because the Fed is channeling money to</text>
  <text start="922.129" dur="4.26">Belgium to help with the purchases of</text>
  <text start="924.589" dur="3.9">these Treasury bonds because if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="926.389" dur="4.97">a seller there has to be a buyer and</text>
  <text start="928.489" dur="7.05">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now now</text>
  <text start="931.359" dur="7.361">what this next report coming up I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="935.539" dur="5.31">know if it&amp;#39;s exactly true but we need to</text>
  <text start="938.72" dur="3.419">look out and we need to understand what</text>
  <text start="940.849" dur="2.011">is happening here with the clive in</text>

  <text start="974.33" dur="5.28">going to really have bad repercussions</text>
  <text start="976.64" dur="6.42">on the government itself because they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1424.95" dur="5.34">because of the minerals and what they</text>
  <text start="1428.22" dur="3.87">have in Crimea they also wanted it</text>
  <text start="1430.29" dur="4.11">because they would gain the Black Sea</text>

  <text start="1599.07" dur="7.38">agent provocateurs to stir things up and</text>
  <text start="1602.779" dur="6.791">we understand that there were riots</text>

  <text start="1622.26" dur="5.1">very very rough they were very</text>
  <text start="1624.59" dur="4.75">intimidating and they were trying to</text>

  <text start="1629.34" dur="7.2">people to start who were pro Donetsk and</text>
  <text start="1632.79" dur="6.96">anti Kiev and all of a sudden these</text>
  <text start="1636.54" dur="4.95">people from Kiev started to come into</text>
  <text start="1639.75" dur="4.23">the picture and of course these are</text>
  <text start="1641.49" dur="5.49">agent provocateurs trying to rile</text>
  <text start="1643.98" dur="6.36">everything up you heard explosions you</text>
  <text start="1646.98" dur="5.52">heard gunshots you saw things happen and</text>
  <text start="1650.34" dur="3.3">they were trying to really and you can</text>
  <text start="1652.5" dur="3.63">just see from the videos they were</text>
  <text start="1653.64" dur="4.59">really pushing the envelope trying to</text>
  <text start="1656.13" dur="4.98">get something started there and this was</text>
  <text start="1658.23" dur="4.59">the whole reason they were there now the</text>
  <text start="1661.11" dur="4.74">United States central bankers were out</text>
  <text start="1662.82" dur="9.09">there today and they placed new</text>
  <text start="1665.85" dur="9.21">sanctions on the inner circle of Putin</text>
  <text start="1671.91" dur="5.04">and they also sanctioned some companies</text>
  <text start="1675.06" dur="4.29">about seven individual Russians and</text>
  <text start="1676.95" dur="4.92">about 17 Russian companies were</text>
  <text start="1679.35" dur="4.98">sanctioned today the CEO of Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1681.87" dur="4.44">largest oil company Rosneft he was</text>
  <text start="1684.33" dur="4.23">sanctioned so we can see they are</text>
  <text start="1686.31" dur="3.84">pushing this agenda forward but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1688.56" dur="3.36">very interesting about all these</text>
  <text start="1690.15" dur="3.27">sanctions and everything that the United</text>
  <text start="1691.92" dur="3.69">States government central bankers are</text>
  <text start="1693.42" dur="5.31">doing they&amp;#39;re really not going to have</text>

  <text start="1698.73" dur="6.54">or whatever they&amp;#39;re doing and even they</text>
  <text start="1701.73" dur="5.48">admit that there will be no effect that</text>
  <text start="1705.27" dur="6.24">comes about from these sanctions and</text>
  <text start="1707.21" dur="7.72">they&amp;#39;re only doing it to show the world</text>
  <text start="1711.51" dur="5.97">that they&amp;#39;re doing something they really</text>
  <text start="1714.93" dur="7.38">don&amp;#39;t have any leverage at this point</text>
  <text start="1717.48" dur="7.35">because Russia is not involved in the</text>
  <text start="1722.31" dur="5.25">country of Ukraine itself at this time</text>
  <text start="1724.83" dur="6.03">they don&amp;#39;t have troops there they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1727.56" dur="6">flying in planes bringing in takes yes</text>
  <text start="1730.86" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re having drills in their own</text>
  <text start="1733.56" dur="4.71">country but they&amp;#39;re really not doing</text>
  <text start="1735.72" dur="4.59">everything that these United States</text>
  <text start="1738.27" dur="3.99">government central bankers said that</text>
  <text start="1740.31" dur="3.089">they were doing they told us there were</text>
  <text start="1742.26" dur="4.409">thousands and that</text>
  <text start="1743.399" dur="5.1">thousands of troops being built up and</text>
  <text start="1746.669" dur="5.43">of course all this turned out to be</text>
  <text start="1748.499" dur="6.27">completely false now the president was</text>
  <text start="1752.099" dur="5.19">out there saying that that the US and</text>
  <text start="1754.769" dur="4.47">its allies would keep broader sanctions</text>
  <text start="1757.289" dur="4.77">in reserve in the event of further</text>
  <text start="1759.239" dur="5.13">escalation on the ground in Ukraine well</text>
  <text start="1762.059" dur="4.29">further escalation the people are</text>
  <text start="1764.369" dur="6.211">marching and protesting peacefully until</text>
  <text start="1766.349" dur="7.68">the Kiev neo-nazi group showed up with</text>
  <text start="1770.58" dur="7.159">clubs masks and started doing things and</text>
  <text start="1774.029" dur="6.09">riling up the situation so what</text>
  <text start="1777.739" dur="5.98">escalation are they looking at right now</text>
  <text start="1780.119" dur="5.4">I haven&amp;#39;t really seen what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1783.719" dur="4.02">talking about because most of it is</text>
  <text start="1785.519" dur="3.9">propaganda and of course the corporate</text>
  <text start="1787.739" dur="3.841">media is out there pushing the</text>
  <text start="1789.419" dur="5.19">propaganda so this is what people are</text>
  <text start="1791.58" dur="5.339">seeing but again everything they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1794.609" dur="5.25">saying is not really happening in</text>
  <text start="1796.919" dur="5.55">Ukraine it&amp;#39;s really coming from the</text>
  <text start="1799.859" dur="5.49">puppet government in Ukraine that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1802.469" dur="6.27">forcing all of this they have squads out</text>

  <text start="1817.499" dur="6.51">terrorists right now just the other day</text>
  <text start="1820.849" dur="4.66">before this puppet government was put</text>
  <text start="1824.009" dur="3.6">into place I should say a couple months</text>
  <text start="1825.509" dur="4.29">ago put into place they were just</text>

  <text start="1840.539" dur="3.87">along with what they say terrorists</text>
  <text start="1842.58" dur="4.169">actually you can see that right here in</text>
  <text start="1844.409" dur="4.56">the United States if you speak out</text>
  <text start="1846.749" dur="4.951">against or criticize the government at</text>
