  <text start="68.55" dur="5.73">dismantle the central bank let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="72.48" dur="4.56">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="74.28" dur="5.1">news now the ADP job numbers they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="77.04" dur="4.77">come out and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="79.38" dur="4.83">unemployment rate is going to be</text>
  <text start="81.81" dur="5.43">dropping even further it looks like</text>
  <text start="84.21" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;re at full employment everything is</text>
  <text start="87.24" dur="3.48">great the economy&amp;#39;s doing fantastic</text>
  <text start="89.07" dur="4.71">nothing to worry about</text>
  <text start="90.72" dur="5.58">but we need to remember nothing has</text>
  <text start="93.78" dur="5.24">changed since the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="96.3" dur="6.15">the manipulation is exactly the same</text>
  <text start="99.02" dur="6.43">nothing has changed as of yet will it</text>
  <text start="102.45" dur="4.83">change yes it will and we see that ADP</text>
  <text start="105.45" dur="5.19">they came in with a much better than</text>
  <text start="107.28" dur="5.97">expected 235 thousand jobs 200,000 were</text>
  <text start="110.64" dur="3.99">expected and we see right now that they</text>
  <text start="113.25" dur="3.71">are saying that the unemployment rate is</text>
  <text start="114.63" dur="5.58">going to be going into the threes and</text>
  <text start="116.96" dur="7">what we can make out of all of this is</text>
  <text start="120.21" dur="7.079">that the illusion is still being kept</text>
  <text start="123.96" dur="6">alive No all of a sudden we just didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="127.289" dur="7.101">get all these jobs the quality of jobs</text>
  <text start="129.96" dur="6.66">well they haven&amp;#39;t returned we don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="134.39" dur="4.78">manufacturing plants popping up all over</text>
  <text start="136.62" dur="3.15">the place it&amp;#39;s just not happening not</text>
  <text start="139.17" dur="4.61">yet</text>
  <text start="139.77" dur="7.68">will it yes it will and one of the</text>
  <text start="143.78" dur="6.16">absolute ways of knowing if things are</text>
  <text start="147.45" dur="3.869">actually really improving and wages are</text>
  <text start="149.94" dur="4.35">going up and we&amp;#39;re getting better</text>
  <text start="151.319" dur="5.25">quality jobs back here in America is to</text>
  <text start="154.29" dur="5.82">just look at the wage growth now the</text>
  <text start="156.569" dur="8.431">2017 wage growth is at its lowest in</text>
  <text start="160.11" dur="7.83">nine years US non-farm labor cost rose</text>
  <text start="165" dur="5.19">just 0.35 percent year-on-year in 2017</text>
  <text start="167.94" dur="5.58">the weakest growth in American worker</text>
  <text start="170.19" dur="5.1">compensation since 2010 the</text>
  <text start="173.52" dur="6.39">fourth-quarter productivity was revised</text>
  <text start="175.29" dur="8.04">up to unchanged from negative 0.1 and we</text>
  <text start="179.91" dur="6">can see that 2017 remains a dismal year</text>
  <text start="183.33" dur="5.01">for the American workers</text>
  <text start="185.91" dur="5.51">and what we&amp;#39;re looking at right now is</text>
  <text start="188.34" dur="6.3">that the economy that we&amp;#39;re in right now</text>
  <text start="191.42" dur="7.15">it just can&amp;#39;t be flipped over and</text>
  <text start="194.64" dur="5.55">everything made better what the central</text>
  <text start="198.57" dur="5.94">bankers have done what those in power</text>
  <text start="200.19" dur="6.57">have done is they have destroyed the</text>
  <text start="204.51" dur="4.98">economy of the United States and the</text>
  <text start="206.76" dur="4.56">global economy now this economy this</text>
  <text start="209.49" dur="4.83">economic system that we&amp;#39;re in right now</text>
  <text start="211.32" dur="6.96">is a central banking system now we need</text>
  <text start="214.32" dur="6.09">to remember what the plan is the plan is</text>
  <text start="218.28" dur="4.26">to get rid of the deep state the plan is</text>
  <text start="220.41" dur="6.21">to get rid of the central banking system</text>
  <text start="222.54" dur="6.36">and take control for the people the</text>
  <text start="226.62" dur="5.63">people will be in control and the only</text>
  <text start="228.9" dur="6.39">way to do this is to have a major reset</text>
  <text start="232.25" dur="5.68">control the narrative dismantle the</text>
  <text start="235.29" dur="5.16">central banks and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="237.93" dur="3.72">in the White House the corporate media</text>
  <text start="240.45" dur="3.84">is out there saying there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="241.65" dur="5.73">chaos people resigning and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="244.29" dur="5.67">unbelievable yes this is happening yes</text>
  <text start="247.38" dur="5.19">people come and go and things like that</text>
  <text start="249.96" dur="7.529">but there&amp;#39;s a reason why these people</text>
  <text start="252.57" dur="6.39">are being forced out because what they</text>
  <text start="257.489" dur="2.701">wanted to do and what the Trump</text>
  <text start="258.96" dur="3.06">administration wanted to do for the</text>
  <text start="260.19" dur="4.89">economy are two different things</text>
  <text start="262.02" dur="6.6">and we can see right now that Gary cone</text>
  <text start="265.08" dur="7.74">chief economic adviser he resigned</text>
  <text start="268.62" dur="7.62">well again Trump is pushing forth this</text>
  <text start="272.82" dur="5.67">these tariffs the reciprocal tax and he</text>
  <text start="276.24" dur="4.13">does not like this I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="278.49" dur="4.35">surprised if minutiae</text>
  <text start="280.37" dur="5.98">eventually resigns he&amp;#39;s a goldman sachs</text>
  <text start="282.84" dur="6.27">boy cohen is also a goldman sachs</text>
  <text start="286.35" dur="5.85">globalist how do you get rid of these</text>
  <text start="289.11" dur="4.92">people you do the opposite of what they</text>
  <text start="292.2" dur="4.35">want and they can&amp;#39;t take it anymore and</text>
  <text start="294.03" dur="4.56">they know there&amp;#39;s no reason to be in</text>
  <text start="296.55" dur="2.91">there because they&amp;#39;re not calling the</text>
  <text start="298.59" dur="5.31">shots anymore</text>
  <text start="299.46" dur="6.03">now even the central bank the IMF one of</text>
  <text start="303.9" dur="4.8">the central banks is out there saying</text>
  <text start="305.49" dur="5.43">listen no one emerges victorious from a</text>
  <text start="308.7" dur="5.13">trade war this is coming from Christine</text>
  <text start="310.92" dur="5.46">Lagarde she warned that the economic</text>
  <text start="313.83" dur="4.56">impact of US import tax would be serious</text>
  <text start="316.38" dur="3.339">if other countries respond with their</text>
  <text start="318.39" dur="4.869">own barriers</text>
  <text start="319.719" dur="6.99">yes it will be serious it will bring</text>
  <text start="323.259" dur="4.74">down their system this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="326.709" dur="4.44">broadcasting right now they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="327.999" dur="5.19">saying hey by the way if Trump continues</text>
  <text start="331.149" dur="4.56">to do this everything will be great</text>
  <text start="333.189" dur="4.08">we&amp;#39;ll still be in power and everything</text>
  <text start="335.709" dur="3.57">will look fine no what they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="337.269" dur="5.07">that there&amp;#39;ll be no winners what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="339.279" dur="6.15">really saying is that their system would</text>
  <text start="342.339" dur="4.53">be under threat that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="345.429" dur="3.6">worried about just like with crypto</text>
  <text start="346.869" dur="4.26">currencies when Bank of America Citibank</text>
  <text start="349.029" dur="3.63">you know said that you know crypto</text>
  <text start="351.129" dur="4.38">currencies of is a threat to their</text>
  <text start="352.659" dur="4.98">business and the IMF the biz the two</text>
  <text start="355.509" dur="3.69">economist from the New York Fed all said</text>
  <text start="357.639" dur="4.17">you know crypto currencies is used for</text>
  <text start="359.199" dur="4.08">terrorist minutia even said this you</text>
  <text start="361.809" dur="3.78">know it&amp;#39;s used for criminals that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="363.279" dur="3.66">real it&amp;#39;s not a currency it&amp;#39;s created</text>
  <text start="365.589" dur="4.11">out of thin air and they went on and on</text>
  <text start="366.939" dur="6.51">and on the reason why they&amp;#39;re doing all</text>
  <text start="369.699" dur="9.12">this is because their entire system is</text>
  <text start="373.449" dur="8.01">being brought down that is what is</text>
  <text start="378.819" dur="5.1">happening right now and since Trump has</text>
  <text start="381.459" dur="5.13">put forth these tariffs he hasn&amp;#39;t signed</text>
  <text start="383.919" dur="5.01">off on it yet we already see us steal</text>
  <text start="386.589" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re talking about reopening their</text>
  <text start="388.929" dur="4.621">doorman Illinois plant and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="391.479" dur="3.51">saying that they might be hiring 500</text>
  <text start="393.55" dur="4.589">people there now this is just the</text>
  <text start="394.989" dur="4.2">beginning it&amp;#39;s not that great but it has</text>
  <text start="398.139" dur="3.6">to start somewhere</text>
  <text start="399.189" dur="4.921">remember how long it took for the deep</text>
  <text start="401.739" dur="4.92">state and all these people that were in</text>
  <text start="404.11" dur="5.159">control for many many years how long it</text>
  <text start="406.659" dur="4.201">took them to move everything offshore if</text>
  <text start="409.269" dur="3.06">you think that everything&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="410.86" dur="5.069">coming back within a couple of months</text>
  <text start="412.329" dur="4.5">that is absolutely ridiculous but it has</text>
  <text start="415.929" dur="4.82">to start somewhere</text>
  <text start="416.829" dur="6.96">and we&amp;#39;re already seeing that this the</text>
  <text start="420.749" dur="6.04">manufacturing plants will start to come</text>
  <text start="423.789" dur="4.65">back to the US very very slowly it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="426.789" dur="5.37">going to happen very quickly so what</text>
  <text start="428.439" dur="6.99">needs to be done to reset everything</text>
  <text start="432.159" dur="6.9">well first you need to control the</text>
  <text start="435.429" dur="7.35">economic narrative you need to control</text>
  <text start="439.059" dur="5.82">what is going on economically in the</text>
  <text start="442.779" dur="5.49">United States right now we have other</text>
  <text start="444.879" dur="5.58">individuals calling the shots venusian</text>
  <text start="448.269" dur="5.131">the central banking system the Federal</text>
  <text start="450.459" dur="6.691">Reserve those in</text>
  <text start="453.4" dur="6.93">power Goldman Sachs Wall Street you name</text>
  <text start="457.15" dur="3.62">it they are controlling everything right</text>
  <text start="460.33" dur="3.03">now</text>
  <text start="460.77" dur="4.179">so what Trump and the administration</text>
  <text start="463.36" dur="4.76">those Patriots working behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="464.949" dur="7.021">what they need to do is they need to</text>
  <text start="468.12" dur="6.19">control the economic narrative they need</text>
  <text start="471.97" dur="5.16">to control what is going on in this</text>
  <text start="474.31" dur="4.079">country and this is what is happening</text>
  <text start="477.13" dur="3.33">right now</text>
  <text start="478.389" dur="4.801">they&amp;#39;re in the midst of controlling</text>
  <text start="480.46" dur="5.88">everything now of course what the</text>
  <text start="483.19" dur="5.55">central bank&amp;#39;s wanted to do as they</text>
  <text start="486.34" dur="4.41">wanted to raise rates very slowly they</text>
  <text start="488.74" dur="4.77">don&amp;#39;t raise them that quickly because it</text>
  <text start="490.75" dur="4.53">calls too much attention on them and if</text>
  <text start="493.51" dur="3.18">they raise them very very quickly</text>
  <text start="495.28" dur="3.359">people are gonna saying hey wait a</text>
  <text start="496.69" dur="3.449">minute you just you know increase the</text>
  <text start="498.639" dur="1.981">rates and everything started to fall</text>
  <text start="500.139" dur="3.301">apart</text>
  <text start="500.62" dur="5.25">so if they do it very slowly and they</text>
  <text start="503.44" dur="4.8">point the Trump and say his economic</text>
  <text start="505.87" dur="4.68">policies aren&amp;#39;t doing well the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="508.24" dur="3.75">gonna come down they can shift the</text>
  <text start="510.55" dur="4.229">narrative and say that he brought the</text>
  <text start="511.99" dur="5.34">economy down if Trump controls the</text>
  <text start="514.779" dur="5.581">economic narrative he can then point to</text>
  <text start="517.33" dur="5.55">the Federal Reserve so he needs to</text>
  <text start="520.36" dur="5.01">control what they are doing now since he</text>
  <text start="522.88" dur="5.19">put forth this idea which he hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="525.37" dur="4.92">signed off on a signed off on the</text>
  <text start="528.07" dur="4.38">tariffs yet but eventually I think he</text>
  <text start="530.29" dur="6.6">will in the next couple of days he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="532.45" dur="6.6">gonna try to stop the Fed from raising</text>
  <text start="536.89" dur="4.71">rates right now because the only reason</text>
  <text start="539.05" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re raising rates is to bring down</text>
  <text start="541.6" dur="5.66">the economy because once they raise</text>
  <text start="544.81" dur="5.31">rates and interest rates start to go up</text>
  <text start="547.26" dur="4.78">and guess what happens the real estate</text>
  <text start="550.12" dur="3.69">market falls apart the student loan</text>
  <text start="552.04" dur="4.14">market falls apart the auto industry</text>
  <text start="553.81" dur="4.92">falls apart everything falls apart we</text>
  <text start="556.18" dur="5.58">already are getting signs that because</text>
  <text start="558.73" dur="5.46">of what Trump is doing the Fed president</text>
  <text start="561.76" dur="4.44">is saying listen because of these</text>
  <text start="564.19" dur="5.269">tariffs that might be signed into law</text>
  <text start="566.2" dur="5.91">because of these reciprocal taxes we</text>
  <text start="569.459" dur="7.151">most likely will delay the interest rate</text>
  <text start="572.11" dur="7.53">hikes now if you notice they started to</text>
  <text start="576.61" dur="5.55">raise rates as soon as Trump was coming</text>
  <text start="579.64" dur="6.09">into office and once he was in office</text>
  <text start="582.16" dur="5.05">they started to push them up even faster</text>
  <text start="585.73" dur="4.79">they didn&amp;#39;t way</text>
  <text start="587.21" dur="5.47">now they&amp;#39;re backing off because of what</text>
  <text start="590.52" dur="4.17">Trump is doing what Trump is trying to</text>
  <text start="592.68" dur="6.23">do is try he&amp;#39;s trying to maneuver and</text>
  <text start="594.69" dur="7.53">take control of the economic narrative</text>
  <text start="598.91" dur="5.92">let&amp;#39;s take this one step further we</text>
  <text start="602.22" dur="3.81">talked about Rand Paul and if you go</text>
  <text start="604.83" dur="5.79">back even further than that his father</text>
  <text start="606.03" dur="7.35">Ron Paul try to push through a some</text>
  <text start="610.62" dur="5.94">piece of legislation that would allow</text>
  <text start="613.38" dur="5.46">the people to audit the Fed and it was</text>
  <text start="616.56" dur="4.89">shot down every single time because the</text>
  <text start="618.84" dur="5.16">Fed has a lot of power those in Congress</text>
  <text start="621.45" dur="4.65">that are getting free money who are</text>
  <text start="624" dur="6.3">becoming very very wealthy from the free</text>
  <text start="626.1" dur="8.22">money they kind of knock it down every</text>
  <text start="630.3" dur="5.34">single time this time around and we know</text>
  <text start="634.32" dur="3.39">and we&amp;#39;ve been saying this for quite a</text>
  <text start="635.64" dur="3.75">while that Trump has Andrew Jackson</text>
  <text start="637.71" dur="4.47">hanging in the White House right on the</text>
  <text start="639.39" dur="5.58">wall right behind his desk that is a</text>
  <text start="642.18" dur="5.19">clear sign that he&amp;#39;s going after the</text>
  <text start="644.97" dur="4.68">central bank I mean he has a lot of work</text>
  <text start="647.37" dur="4.05">ahead of him he&amp;#39;s cleaning up the deep</text>
  <text start="649.65" dur="3.75">state and eventually what will happen is</text>
  <text start="651.42" dur="6.09">he will go after the central banking</text>
  <text start="653.4" dur="7.86">system now Senator Rand Paul announced</text>
  <text start="657.51" dur="6.87">that he will introduce his audit the Fed</text>
  <text start="661.26" dur="6.09">legislation which would permit a full</text>
  <text start="664.38" dur="6.33">audit of the Federal Reserve System now</text>
  <text start="667.35" dur="6.99">this is being attached as an amendment</text>
  <text start="670.71" dur="5.94">to the Senate banking bill the Senate is</text>
  <text start="674.34" dur="10.1">expected to vote on the banking bill S</text>
  <text start="676.65" dur="11.13">dot to 155 and once they do guess what</text>
  <text start="684.44" dur="7.51">if they push it through they&amp;#39;ll be able</text>
  <text start="687.78" dur="6.18">to audit the Fed now Rand Paul is out</text>
  <text start="691.95" dur="4.53">there and he&amp;#39;s saying while we have made</text>
  <text start="693.96" dur="5.129">great strides in reviving our economy</text>
  <text start="696.48" dur="4.83">through curbing overzealous regulation</text>
