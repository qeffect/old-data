  <text start="48.879" dur="5.761">collapse financial news now out in Spain</text>
  <text start="52.48" dur="4.35">the government there is telling everyone</text>
  <text start="54.64" dur="3.5">how great the economy&amp;#39;s doing the</text>
  <text start="56.83" dur="4.08">economy&amp;#39;s firing on all cylinders</text>
  <text start="58.14" dur="5.23">everything looks good the world should</text>
  <text start="60.91" dur="7.44">be looking at Spain as a shining example</text>
  <text start="63.37" dur="6.21">of how well the economy can do they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="68.35" dur="5.94">saying the economy is going to be</text>
  <text start="69.58" dur="7.95">growing by 3% this year and when you</text>
  <text start="74.29" dur="7.97">look at the economy a little bit closer</text>
  <text start="77.53" dur="8.22">it seems the government employees always</text>
  <text start="82.26" dur="6.67">exaggerate quite a bit about how their</text>
  <text start="85.75" dur="5.1">country is doing or how the economy is</text>
  <text start="88.93" dur="4.5">doing and we see this throughout Europe</text>
  <text start="90.85" dur="5.61">we see it in Canada Australia and the</text>
  <text start="93.43" dur="6.509">United States and when you look at the</text>
  <text start="96.46" dur="6.99">economy poverty is growing at a</text>
  <text start="99.939" dur="8.341">startling rate unemployment continues to</text>
  <text start="103.45" dur="7.529">hover above twenty percent and public</text>
  <text start="108.28" dur="6.29">debt is almost three times what it was</text>
  <text start="110.979" dur="6.331">at the beginning of the crisis so yeah</text>
  <text start="114.57" dur="6.549">this economy is just doing fantastic in</text>
  <text start="117.31" dur="6.21">Spain no it&amp;#39;s not and what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="121.119" dur="7.231">is is that we&amp;#39;re coming towards the end</text>
  <text start="123.52" dur="7.17">of these systems and as we approach the</text>
  <text start="128.35" dur="4.77">end game here the government&amp;#39;s need to</text>
  <text start="130.69" dur="5.58">convince you that the economies are</text>
  <text start="133.12" dur="6.72">doing well to keep you blindsided about</text>
  <text start="136.27" dur="6.87">what&amp;#39;s really going on here and looking</text>
  <text start="139.84" dur="7.28">at spain&amp;#39;s economy spain&amp;#39;s economy is so</text>
  <text start="143.14" dur="7.38">fragile right now that the spanish banks</text>
  <text start="147.12" dur="6.67">basically have a huge risk risk of</text>
  <text start="150.52" dur="5.7">exposure many banks have been caught</text>
  <text start="153.79" dur="5.85">engaging in abusive mortgage lending</text>
  <text start="156.22" dur="6.269">practices and could up could end up</text>
  <text start="159.64" dur="4.71">having to pay back customers billions of</text>
  <text start="162.489" dur="3.871">euros</text>
  <text start="164.35" dur="6.5">there are currently about 2.5 million</text>
  <text start="166.36" dur="6.93">mortgages with floor clauses in Spain if</text>
  <text start="170.85" dur="4.93">refunds were to be mandated retro</text>
  <text start="173.29" dur="5.22">actively it would mean billions perhaps</text>
  <text start="175.78" dur="6.27">tens of billions of euros in payments</text>
  <text start="178.51" dur="5.22">and the banks would not be able to</text>
  <text start="182.05" dur="5.94">handle this and they would need to be</text>
  <text start="183.73" dur="6.66">bailed out so is Spain doing as well as</text>
  <text start="187.99" dur="5.99">the government employees are saying no</text>
  <text start="190.39" dur="6.69">it is not and this goes with almost</text>
  <text start="193.98" dur="5.38">every single country in the private</text>
  <text start="197.08" dur="4.65">wasn&amp;#39;t central bank system some are a</text>
  <text start="199.36" dur="4.02">little bit worse off than others but</text>
  <text start="201.73" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;re all heading in the same</text>
  <text start="203.38" dur="6.42">direction here in the United States we</text>
  <text start="207.55" dur="5.25">have one of the biggest illusions going</text>
  <text start="209.8" dur="6.77">we saw this back in 1929 leading up to</text>
  <text start="212.8" dur="6.21">the great depression where Europe was</text>
  <text start="216.57" dur="3.82">completely falling apart and when</text>
  <text start="219.01" dur="3.9">everyone looked at the United States the</text>
  <text start="220.39" dur="4.65">stock market was soaring it was the</text>
  <text start="222.91" dur="5.49">roaring 20s everything was fine and then</text>
  <text start="225.04" dur="6.42">before you knew it everything came to a</text>
  <text start="228.4" dur="6.03">screeching halt and collapsed we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="231.46" dur="6.81">seeing the same thing right now from all</text>
  <text start="234.43" dur="6.18">the layoffs from uh last year to this</text>
  <text start="238.27" dur="5.37">year reported by challenger grain</text>
  <text start="240.61" dur="5.28">Christmas approaching 1 million layoffs</text>
  <text start="243.64" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s getting harder and harder for the</text>
  <text start="245.89" dur="6.75">government to manipulate these numbers</text>
  <text start="248.02" dur="7.26">and we know the economy is basically</text>
  <text start="252.64" dur="6.27">taking a dive here we know retail sales</text>
  <text start="255.28" dur="4.74">are completely down and it looks like</text>
  <text start="258.91" dur="2.01">it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot worse than</text>
  <text start="260.02" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="260.92" dur="4.08">estimating that their estimates were a</text>
  <text start="263.29" dur="3.12">little bit higher than what really</text>
  <text start="265" dur="3.66">happened on Black Friday and Cyber</text>
  <text start="266.41" dur="5.25">Monday and it might be even a little bit</text>
  <text start="268.66" dur="4.56">worse than everyone thought and going</text>
  <text start="271.66" dur="2.97">throughout the rest of this year I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="273.22" dur="3.03">think it&amp;#39;s going to improve whatsoever</text>
  <text start="274.63" dur="6.33">but the initial claims the initial</text>
  <text start="276.25" dur="8.19">jobless claims they pushed up around</text>
  <text start="280.96" dur="7.77">13,000 to 282,000 this is the highest</text>
  <text start="284.44" dur="5.49">claim since early July and when we look</text>
  <text start="288.73" dur="4.29">at this we can see there are more</text>

  <text start="327.58" dur="6.96">fannie and freddie they always do this</text>
  <text start="330.91" dur="5.97">during the holiday season they basically</text>
  <text start="334.54" dur="5.79">give a small gesture to struggling</text>
  <text start="336.88" dur="5.22">homeowners they don&amp;#39;t foreclose and in</text>
  <text start="340.33" dur="4.98">vicked the people from their houses</text>
  <text start="342.1" dur="6.87">during the holiday so from December</text>

  <text start="348.97" dur="5.91">can stay in their homes as soon as</text>
  <text start="351.58" dur="5.13">January third hits well guess what they</text>
  <text start="354.88" dur="4.08">can be evicted from their homes and</text>
  <text start="356.71" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of people that are</text>
  <text start="358.96" dur="3.39">having a very tough time this holiday</text>
  <text start="360.31" dur="4.5">season we&amp;#39;re seeing that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="362.35" dur="4.77">struggling trying to make ends meet and</text>
  <text start="364.81" dur="8.16">more and more people are coming into</text>
  <text start="367.12" dur="9.81">this mix and basically this whole entire</text>
  <text start="372.97" dur="7.11">nation right now is slipping away I mean</text>
  <text start="376.93" dur="6.12">the middle class right now doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="380.08" dur="6.84">really even exist they slipped into the</text>
  <text start="383.05" dur="6.75">poor poverty section and right now the</text>
  <text start="386.92" dur="7.86">middle class is a minority in the United</text>
  <text start="389.8" dur="8.76">States and right now as we go into next</text>
  <text start="394.78" dur="6.24">year this is not going to turn around</text>
  <text start="398.56" dur="6.72">it&amp;#39;s getting worse and worse as time</text>
  <text start="401.02" dur="7.59">goes on and for the first time in US</text>
  <text start="405.28" dur="6.84">history we haven&amp;#39;t seen anything like</text>
  <text start="408.61" dur="6.54">this a new analysis of government data</text>
  <text start="412.12" dur="5.87">shows that as of 2015 middle-income</text>
  <text start="415.15" dur="6.09">households have become the minority</text>
  <text start="417.99" dur="6.61">extending a multi-decade decline that</text>
  <text start="421.24" dur="6.45">confirms basically that this society of</text>
  <text start="424.6" dur="7.86">the united states that we live in right</text>
  <text start="427.69" dur="7.17">now is completely falling apart 49.9</text>
  <text start="432.46" dur="4.23">sent of all Americans now live in a home</text>
  <text start="434.86" dur="6.649">that receives money from the government</text>
  <text start="436.69" dur="7.11">each month sadly the the trend is</text>
  <text start="441.509" dur="4.801">completely destroying the middle class</text>
  <text start="443.8" dur="5.459">in America and it&amp;#39;s going to accelerate</text>
  <text start="446.31" dur="4.3">back in 1971 about two out of three</text>
  <text start="449.259" dur="4.59">Americans lived in middle-income</text>
  <text start="450.61" dur="5.399">households since then the middle has</text>
  <text start="453.849" dur="5.581">been steadily shrinking and we heard</text>
  <text start="456.009" dur="8.491">about this years and years ago and here</text>
  <text start="459.43" dur="7.769">we are today I mean middle-income</text>
  <text start="464.5" dur="5.28">Americans not only have shrunk as a</text>
  <text start="467.199" dur="5.371">share of the population but have fallen</text>
  <text start="469.78" dur="5.25">further behind financially with their</text>
  <text start="472.57" dur="8.04">median income down four percent compared</text>
  <text start="475.03" dur="7.77">with the year of two thousand and we can</text>
  <text start="480.61" dur="4.86">see right now that it&amp;#39;s getting harder</text>
  <text start="482.8" dur="7.89">and harder for people just to make ends</text>
  <text start="485.47" dur="8.97">meet so when we look at America right</text>
  <text start="490.69" dur="7.08">now what do we see well we see retail</text>
  <text start="494.44" dur="8.789">contracting sales in the retail industry</text>
  <text start="497.77" dur="9">is shrinking stores are closing the</text>
  <text start="503.229" dur="6.841">housing market is not catering to the</text>
  <text start="506.77" dur="4.59">American family anymore most of the</text>
  <text start="510.07" dur="4.23">sales are coming from hedge funds</text>
  <text start="511.36" dur="4.469">investment companies from foreign</text>
  <text start="514.3" dur="5.099">investors but the foreign investors are</text>
  <text start="515.829" dur="5.101">now drying up and they&amp;#39;re doing whatever</text>
  <text start="519.399" dur="3.721">they possibly can to bring in the</text>
  <text start="520.93" dur="4.13">American people into the mix but the</text>
  <text start="523.12" dur="3.99">American people are tapped out and</text>
  <text start="525.06" dur="6.7">housing prices are starting to fall</text>
  <text start="527.11" dur="6.81">right now and housing housing if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="531.76" dur="4.26">trying to sell right now in many many of</text>
  <text start="533.92" dur="5.1">the cities they are staying on the</text>
  <text start="536.02" dur="4.11">market longer and longer so the</text>
  <text start="539.02" dur="3.87">government had to come out and</text>
  <text start="540.13" dur="5.04">manipulate inflation manipulate the</text>
  <text start="542.89" dur="5.189">calculation of GDP manipulate</text>
  <text start="545.17" dur="5.25">unemployment basically they had to</text>
  <text start="548.079" dur="5.461">manipulate the entire economy to make it</text>
  <text start="550.42" dur="6.93">look good the Baltic Dry Index has</text>
  <text start="553.54" dur="6.03">fallen again to 534 during this time of</text>
  <text start="557.35" dur="5.01">year usually it&amp;#39;s around a thousand</text>
  <text start="559.57" dur="6.74">eleven hundred sometimes it was at 1400</text>
  <text start="562.36" dur="6.37">this is very very low</text>
  <text start="566.31" dur="7.77">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting right now is</text>
  <text start="568.73" dur="10.45">that corporate insiders they are dumping</text>
  <text start="574.08" dur="9.509">their stocks and they&amp;#39;re selling their</text>
  <text start="579.18" dur="6.659">shares at near-record levels so why</text>
  <text start="583.589" dur="4.861">isn&amp;#39;t this a surprise that insiders are</text>
  <text start="585.839" dur="3.961">bailing well revenues have been falling</text>
  <text start="588.45" dur="4.5">for the past year in many of the</text>
  <text start="589.8" dur="7.65">industries and commodities have cratered</text>
  <text start="592.95" dur="7.41">and after a years and years of boosting</text>
  <text start="597.45" dur="5.22">reported profits with various kinds of</text>
  <text start="600.36" dur="5.03">financial engineering financial</text>
  <text start="602.67" dur="4.74">tinkering financial manipulation</text>
  <text start="605.39" dur="4.48">corporations seem to have run out of</text>
  <text start="607.41" dur="4.92">tricks earnings have begun to reflect</text>
  <text start="609.87" dur="5.7">reality and it&amp;#39;s not pretty because what</text>
  <text start="612.33" dur="7.44">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now earnings taking a</text>
  <text start="615.57" dur="6.47">dive and remember that insiders are</text>
  <text start="619.77" dur="4.86">selling while the corporation&amp;#39;s they run</text>
  <text start="622.04" dur="5.049">continue to buy back huge numbers of</text>
  <text start="624.63" dur="4.83">shares with borrowed money the</text>
  <text start="627.089" dur="4.741">implication there supporting their stock</text>
  <text start="629.46" dur="6.72">in order to get out while the getting is</text>
  <text start="631.83" dur="6.21">good so we already see the inside people</text>
  <text start="636.18" dur="4.95">are saying okay it&amp;#39;s time to sell this</text>
  <text start="638.04" dur="4.71">tells you something this tells you that</text>
  <text start="641.13" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re selling at the height of the</text>
  <text start="642.75" dur="5.93">market the corporations are continually</text>
  <text start="645.15" dur="6.78">buying to enable them to do this and</text>
  <text start="648.68" dur="5.2">hopefully the people on Main Street</text>
  <text start="651.93" dur="3.15">aren&amp;#39;t looking at this saying hey this</text>
  <text start="653.88" dur="5">is a great time to buy this stuff</text>
  <text start="655.08" dur="6.38">because insiders the people with the</text>
  <text start="658.88" dur="6.76">knowledge of when this is coming down</text>
  <text start="661.46" dur="5.92">usually get get out at the top they</text>
  <text start="665.64" dur="4.949">don&amp;#39;t wait for the market to fall and</text>
  <text start="667.38" dur="7.02">they try to basically remove themselves</text>
  <text start="670.589" dur="6.571">from the picture and cash in on their</text>
  <text start="674.4" dur="6.75">profits and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing we</text>
  <text start="677.16" dur="6.84">also see them take huge risks and they</text>
  <text start="681.15" dur="4.8">try to prosper on the downside but right</text>
  <text start="684" dur="5.52">now they&amp;#39;re looking at everything and</text>
  <text start="685.95" dur="6">saying okay it is time to get out so</text>
  <text start="689.52" dur="5.52">what are we seeing right now well we</text>
  <text start="691.95" dur="6.42">understand the economy has been through</text>
  <text start="695.04" dur="4.89">the harvest phase where the wealthy the</text>
  <text start="698.37" dur="5.34">one the five</text>
  <text start="699.93" dur="6.27">sent basically are stealing the wealth</text>
  <text start="703.71" dur="5.61">from the rest of the country this is the</text>
  <text start="706.2" dur="5.34">harvest phase we are now coming out of</text>
  <text start="709.32" dur="8.579">the harvest face and we&amp;#39;re heading into</text>
  <text start="711.54" dur="9.09">the global reset and Russia China the</text>
  <text start="717.899" dur="5.341">bricks it&amp;#39;s all part of the same system</text>
  <text start="720.63" dur="6.51">and everything is flowing from west to</text>
  <text start="723.24" dur="6.09">east now remember central bankers have</text>
  <text start="727.14" dur="5.759">no allegiance to any country they really</text>
  <text start="729.33" dur="5.34">don&amp;#39;t care as long as they make a profit</text>
  <text start="732.899" dur="3.661">and they can set up their central</text>
  <text start="734.67" dur="5.7">banking system in whatever country</text>
  <text start="736.56" dur="8.36">they&amp;#39;re in so right now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="740.37" dur="7.86">seeing is there&amp;#39;s a new system evolving</text>
  <text start="744.92" dur="5.8">we see the u1 becoming a reserve</text>
  <text start="748.23" dur="3.78">currency they got the green light it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="750.72" dur="6.119">going to be included in the SDR basket</text>
  <text start="752.01" dur="7.44">and this plan was outlined decades ago</text>

  <text start="768.3" dur="7.74">they&amp;#39;re getting ready for the big global</text>
  <text start="771.15" dur="7.309">economic reset and we have to realize</text>
  <text start="776.04" dur="6.06">that the central banking system the Fed</text>
  <text start="778.459" dur="5.651">they know exactly what&amp;#39;s happening they</text>
  <text start="782.1" dur="6.84">can&amp;#39;t keep the system going and</text>
  <text start="784.11" dur="8.04">eventually it has to come down but since</text>
  <text start="788.94" dur="5.25">the central banking system is running</text>
  <text start="792.15" dur="4.02">the world right now they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="794.19" dur="4.11">be blamed for this because how would</text>
  <text start="796.17" dur="4.68">they convince everyone it&amp;#39;s in their</text>
  <text start="798.3" dur="5.49">best interest to move everything from</text>
  <text start="800.85" dur="6.03">the west to the east so this to distract</text>
  <text start="803.79" dur="5.989">everyone they need some type of an event</text>
  <text start="806.88" dur="6.06">they need a war they need something and</text>
  <text start="809.779" dur="6.101">after the war they can say okay let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="812.94" dur="6.24">set up a new entirely different system</text>
  <text start="815.88" dur="8.67">oh look China has manufacturing oh look</text>
  <text start="819.18" dur="7.649">they have gold we already said that he</text>
  <text start="824.55" dur="4.95">won is a reserve currency let&amp;#39;s go with</text>
  <text start="826.829" dur="6.211">them this time I mean happen back after</text>
  <text start="829.5" dur="6.87">World War two it was the United States</text>
  <text start="833.04" dur="6.469">that was the center of everything now</text>
  <text start="836.37" dur="5.55">things are changing is this a good thing</text>
  <text start="839.509" dur="3.64">well in the beginning people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="841.92" dur="3.18">going to realize anything because</text>
  <text start="843.149" dur="3.331">everything will be backed by gold it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="845.1" dur="4.31">in the beginning stages so everyone will</text>
  <text start="846.48" dur="5.94">feel comfortable everything will thrive</text>
  <text start="849.41" dur="6.28">but eventually we will end up in the</text>
  <text start="852.42" dur="5.55">same spot so the solution get rid of the</text>
  <text start="855.69" dur="5.04">central bankers and when you look at the</text>
  <text start="857.97" dur="5.25">actions of the Federal Reserve you can</text>
  <text start="860.73" dur="6.33">see that they are completely planning</text>
  <text start="863.22" dur="6.27">for this and we are heading into the</text>
  <text start="867.06" dur="5.839">next phase and I mean right now they</text>
  <text start="869.49" dur="6.57">have zerp and this is the only thing</text>
  <text start="872.899" dur="6.451">that is holding the stock market</text>
  <text start="876.06" dur="7.35">together and keeping everything</text>
  <text start="879.35" dur="8.53">continually moving upward without the</text>
  <text start="883.41" dur="6.81">zero interest rates guess what the whole</text>
  <text start="887.88" dur="7.56">thing falls apart even if they increase</text>
  <text start="890.22" dur="7.049">it by point 25 basis points the cost</text>
  <text start="895.44" dur="4.5">free overnight lending to banks and</text>
  <text start="897.269" dur="5.01">corporations that pretty much will come</text>
  <text start="899.94" dur="4.44">to an end they will not be able to</text>
  <text start="902.279" dur="5.04">afford continued lending on the massive</text>
  <text start="904.38" dur="5.73">scale that they&amp;#39;ve been doing since 2009</text>
  <text start="907.319" dur="4.591">this means no more stock buybacks for</text>
  <text start="910.11" dur="3.87">dying companies like IBM General Motors</text>
  <text start="911.91" dur="5.09">and many others this means a</text>
  <text start="913.98" dur="7.95">considerable decline in the markets and</text>
  <text start="917" dur="9.19">like I said when they are ready to bring</text>
  <text start="921.93" dur="9.29">this down most likely they will increase</text>
  <text start="926.19" dur="8.61">the interest rates by a small tiny</text>
  <text start="931.22" dur="6.369">fraction just to show everyone that</text>
  <text start="934.8" dur="4.349">we&amp;#39;re in a recovery this is the signal</text>
  <text start="937.589" dur="3.631">that they&amp;#39;re getting ready to bring down</text>
  <text start="939.149" dur="6.18">the entire system it happened back in</text>
  <text start="941.22" dur="6.479">2008 interest rates kept on going up the</text>
  <text start="945.329" dur="6.24">system came down the same things going</text>
