  <text start="242.109" dur="4.74">complete disaster and we can see that</text>
  <text start="244.18" dur="5.85">those in power remember the central bank</text>
  <text start="246.849" dur="4.11">they do not want to lose their control</text>
  <text start="250.03" dur="3.359">over the system</text>
  <text start="250.959" dur="4.52">even when the system crashes because</text>

  <text start="258.099" dur="3.301">old debt and say hey don&amp;#39;t worry about</text>
  <text start="259.66" dur="4.979">it we have a brand new system it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.4" dur="4.769">secure it&amp;#39;s backed by gold and you know</text>
  <text start="264.639" dur="3.481">what happens if they&amp;#39;re in control</text>
  <text start="266.169" dur="3.991">they&amp;#39;re gonna lead us down the same</text>
  <text start="268.12" dur="4.229">exact path yes in the beginning it will</text>
  <text start="270.16" dur="4.379">feel great but eventually what will</text>
  <text start="272.349" dur="4.341">happen we will end up in the same exact</text>
  <text start="274.539" dur="6.031">place now they&amp;#39;re setting the stage to</text>
  <text start="276.69" dur="5.199">blame this collapse on Trump because</text>
  <text start="280.57" dur="3.02">they don&amp;#39;t want to be blamed for this</text>
  <text start="281.889" dur="4.831">because they need to restart the system</text>
  <text start="283.59" dur="5.59">and we can see that the national retail</text>
  <text start="286.72" dur="5.04">Association they are out there saying</text>
  <text start="289.18" dur="7.34">that retail sales in 2017 they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="291.76" dur="6.719">expected to grow around 3.8 percent and</text>
  <text start="296.52" dur="3.91">when they&amp;#39;re looking at the economy</text>

  <text start="300.43" dur="5.94">it&amp;#39;s very low unemployment housing is</text>
  <text start="303.61" dur="6.059">solid and consumer confidence is higher</text>
  <text start="306.37" dur="5.76">the only thing that could derail all of</text>
  <text start="309.669" dur="6.681">this this is what the national retail</text>
  <text start="312.13" dur="10.47">Association is saying is that if trum</text>
  <text start="316.35" dur="11.37">puts forth his border tax if he goes</text>
  <text start="322.6" dur="7.47">ahead with his tax and trade policies</text>
  <text start="327.72" dur="5.05">that&amp;#39;s it we&amp;#39;re doomed</text>
  <text start="330.07" dur="8.34">we will not see these numbers in retail</text>
  <text start="332.77" dur="7.65">it will take its toll on retail and we</text>
  <text start="338.41" dur="5.21">can see right now this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="340.42" dur="9.6">doing they&amp;#39;re setting up the narrative</text>
  <text start="343.62" dur="8.02">to blame all of this on Trump they need</text>
  <text start="350.02" dur="4.62">someone to blame they can&amp;#39;t blame Russia</text>
  <text start="351.64" dur="5.16">anymore because we can see that Trump</text>
  <text start="354.64" dur="4.8">has been speaking to Putin if you notice</text>
  <text start="356.8" dur="5.49">all those different news stories about</text>
  <text start="359.44" dur="4.95">Russian aggression well they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="362.29" dur="4.41">not getting any traction anymore the</text>

  <text start="366.7" dur="4.8">out there anymore it kind of just</text>
  <text start="368.62" dur="5.61">disappeared so it&amp;#39;s very difficult to</text>
  <text start="371.5" dur="4.38">blame this on Russia can they try</text>
  <text start="374.23" dur="3.23">blaming it on Iran can they try blending</text>
  <text start="375.88" dur="4.86">on China but it&amp;#39;s not gonna work and</text>
