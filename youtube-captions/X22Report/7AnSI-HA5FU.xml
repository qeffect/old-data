  <text start="66.43" dur="4.89">panicking about protecting their wealth</text>
  <text start="69.03" dur="4.93">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="71.32" dur="4.74">financial news well it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="73.96" dur="5.159">look like everything is hitting at once</text>
  <text start="76.06" dur="4.59">here now we talked about Venezuela we</text>
  <text start="79.119" dur="5.671">knew they weren&amp;#39;t making their payments</text>
  <text start="80.65" dur="7.859">and we can see at this point Venezuela</text>
  <text start="84.79" dur="6.06">officially declared in default the</text>
  <text start="88.509" dur="7.761">Wilmington Trust the trustee of the 8.5%</text>

  <text start="117.88" dur="4.64">have to see where this all goes from</text>
  <text start="119.319" dur="7.771">this point and we can see at this time</text>
  <text start="122.52" dur="5.59">that it&amp;#39;s not just Venezuela many and we</text>
  <text start="127.09" dur="3.54">know there&amp;#39;s a lot of pressure on</text>
  <text start="128.11" dur="3.84">Venezuela from the US and the Cabal</text>
  <text start="130.63" dur="3">where they&amp;#39;re putting a lot of pressure</text>
  <text start="131.95" dur="3.36">on Venezuela because they&amp;#39;ve they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="133.63" dur="3.9">been wanting to get into Venezuela to</text>
  <text start="135.31" dur="3.72">capture their natural resources which is</text>
  <text start="137.53" dur="4.05">oil just like they&amp;#39;ve done in the Middle</text>
  <text start="139.03" dur="5.16">East and at this point they&amp;#39;re putting a</text>
  <text start="141.58" dur="4.019">lot of pressure on them and it&amp;#39;s making</text>
  <text start="144.19" dur="3.78">it very difficult for the people and</text>
  <text start="145.599" dur="5.161">every time the Cabal puts pressure on a</text>
  <text start="147.97" dur="4.95">country it&amp;#39;s a lot of pressure on the</text>
  <text start="150.76" dur="4.38">people of the country because the</text>
  <text start="152.92" dur="4.47">sanctions and everything else the people</text>
  <text start="155.14" dur="5.72">really lose out but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="157.39" dur="7.65">right now is that the entire global</text>
  <text start="160.86" dur="5.98">economic system it&amp;#39;s starting to break</text>
  <text start="165.04" dur="3.39">down in many different areas and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="166.84" dur="3.24">seeing it in many different areas and</text>
  <text start="168.43" dur="3.36">it&amp;#39;s all not going to show up at once it</text>
  <text start="170.08" dur="3.659">will show up at once when everything</text>
  <text start="171.79" dur="3.87">starts to implode at the same time but</text>
  <text start="173.739" dur="4.711">what happens just like it happened back</text>
  <text start="175.66" dur="4.29">in 2008 we see a little pockets here and</text>
  <text start="178.45" dur="3.36">there and what they do it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="179.95" dur="3.989">a dam which is bursting you know a</text>
  <text start="181.81" dur="5.04">pinhole opens up you put you know some</text>
  <text start="183.939" dur="5.101">putty on it you try to fix it another</text>
  <text start="186.85" dur="3.77">opens up you try to fix that one then</text>
  <text start="189.04" dur="4.68">another one opens up it gets bigger and</text>
  <text start="190.62" dur="4.45">before you know it you just can&amp;#39;t fix it</text>
  <text start="193.72" dur="3.78">and the whole thing starts to crack and</text>
  <text start="195.07" dur="5.55">the whole dam comes quite you know fault</text>
  <text start="197.5" dur="5.34">it basically cracks apart falls apart</text>
  <text start="200.62" dur="5.79">and the water rushes through this is</text>
  <text start="202.84" dur="6.69">what we are seeing right now if we look</text>
  <text start="206.41" dur="4.77">at the united kingdom and we talked</text>
  <text start="209.53" dur="4.38">about retail sales we talked about</text>
  <text start="211.18" dur="4.14">inflation there we are and also retail</text>
  <text start="213.91" dur="5">employment we are saying things are</text>
  <text start="215.32" dur="7.38">really breaking down there now the CBI</text>
  <text start="218.91" dur="6.07">reported their retail sales and what</text>
  <text start="222.7" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re reporting is that the retail</text>
  <text start="224.98" dur="5.51">sales in the UK well they have crashed</text>
  <text start="227.95" dur="4.86">by five five point two percent and</text>
  <text start="230.49" dur="5.05">they&amp;#39;re saying that this is the most</text>
  <text start="232.81" dur="5.19">horrific October they&amp;#39;ve seen it is the</text>
  <text start="235.54" dur="4.35">worth month since right before the</text>
  <text start="238" dur="4.47">brexit in April of 2016</text>
  <text start="239.89" dur="7.23">and remember they haven&amp;#39;t really left</text>
  <text start="242.47" dur="7.26">the EU yet they&amp;#39;re still in there so</text>
  <text start="247.12" dur="4.92">nothing has really changed and what</text>
  <text start="249.73" dur="5.28">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that consumers they have</text>
  <text start="252.04" dur="5.46">resisted spending in October because</text>
  <text start="255.01" dur="4.05">what has happened inflation they saw the</text>
  <text start="257.5" dur="5.1">Consumer Price Index rise by three</text>
  <text start="259.06" dur="7.89">percent the confidence of individuals in</text>
  <text start="262.6" dur="7.68">the country is falling wages can&amp;#39;t keep</text>
  <text start="266.95" dur="6.87">up with higher inflation with higher</text>
  <text start="270.28" dur="7.19">mortgage payments with higher automobile</text>
  <text start="273.82" dur="5.21">payments with higher food costs and</text>
  <text start="277.47" dur="4.33">everything else</text>
  <text start="279.03" dur="5.44">fashion sales have plunged by 7.9</text>
  <text start="281.8" dur="5.76">percent year-on-year and this is the</text>
  <text start="284.47" dur="6.51">worst segment but retailers aren&amp;#39;t alone</text>
  <text start="287.56" dur="6.06">restaurant pubs bars guess what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="290.98" dur="5.37">seeing the same exact thing and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="293.62" dur="6.54">starting to see this huge meltdown now</text>
  <text start="296.35" dur="5.46">remember as retail melts down people are</text>
  <text start="300.16" dur="3.63">going to lose their jobs in retail</text>
  <text start="301.81" dur="4.89">because stores are going to close this</text>
  <text start="303.79" dur="4.5">is spreading across the globe and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="306.7" dur="3.48">seeing it in many different areas and</text>
  <text start="308.29" dur="4.29">after this holiday season it is just</text>
  <text start="310.18" dur="4.71">going to get worse but the Cabal the</text>
  <text start="312.58" dur="4.86">central bankers they don&amp;#39;t want people</text>
  <text start="314.89" dur="5.58">to know that things are drastically</text>
  <text start="317.44" dur="4.65">changing to the downside so what</text>
  <text start="320.47" dur="4.04">they do is they try to manipulate</text>
  <text start="322.09" dur="4.44">everything to keep everyone in the dark</text>
  <text start="324.51" dur="5.29">distracted from what&amp;#39;s really going on</text>
  <text start="326.53" dur="4.89">so while all this was breaking down and</text>
  <text start="329.8" dur="4.29">things are happening out in the Middle</text>
  <text start="331.42" dur="6.78">East and all this other stuff we can see</text>
  <text start="334.09" dur="7.86">that they or someone dumped thirty eight</text>
  <text start="338.2" dur="7.05">thousand gold contracts in eight minutes</text>
  <text start="341.95" dur="6.72">and they priced and they smashed the</text>
  <text start="345.25" dur="5.07">silver price down also and all of a</text>
  <text start="348.67" dur="4.35">sudden everything just went down and</text>
  <text start="350.32" dur="6.45">this was around 11:00 a.m. Eastern</text>
  <text start="353.02" dur="7.41">Standard Time and it ended at 11:16 a.m.</text>
  <text start="356.77" dur="8.61">and this was worth about four point nine</text>
  <text start="360.43" dur="7.47">million dollars worth of gold and we can</text>
  <text start="365.38" dur="5.88">see it at this point that they are</text>
  <text start="367.9" dur="5.16">trying to keep gold very low they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="371.26" dur="4.83">want it rising like the crypto</text>
  <text start="373.06" dur="5">currencies that&amp;#39;s a free market this is</text>
  <text start="376.09" dur="4.41">why we&amp;#39;re seeing these ups and downs and</text>
  <text start="378.06" dur="3.42">when we step back we can see that</text>
  <text start="380.5" dur="3.21">Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="381.48" dur="6.07">they&amp;#39;re continually moving up and up and</text>
  <text start="383.71" dur="6.87">up if they allow gold to do this if they</text>
  <text start="387.55" dur="6">allowed gold to be in a free market well</text>
  <text start="390.58" dur="4.53">it would be a reflection on what is</text>
  <text start="393.55" dur="2.88">really going on in the economy what is</text>
  <text start="395.11" dur="3.03">really happening with the dollar and</text>
  <text start="396.43" dur="4.59">they don&amp;#39;t want them to happen because</text>
  <text start="398.14" dur="4.8">guess what the world the world yes I</text>
  <text start="401.02" dur="4.02">said the world would lose confidence in</text>
  <text start="402.94" dur="4.35">the dollar and it would come crashing</text>
  <text start="405.04" dur="4.71">down all they&amp;#39;re doing right now is</text>
  <text start="407.29" dur="4.98">putting band-aids over it trying to</text>
  <text start="409.75" dur="4.65">pretend that everything is okay but in</text>
  <text start="412.27" dur="3.27">the end just like we&amp;#39;ve seen it in the</text>
  <text start="414.4" dur="3.8">past the whole thing&amp;#39;s gonna come</text>
  <text start="415.54" dur="5.97">tumbling down consumer confidence</text>
  <text start="418.2" dur="5.02">unexpectedly dropped and we see it went</text>
  <text start="421.51" dur="3.54">from 100 point seven down to ninety</text>
  <text start="423.22" dur="3.18">seven point eight people are starting to</text>
  <text start="425.05" dur="3.42">realize that there are major major</text>
  <text start="426.4" dur="3.3">problems and we&amp;#39;re going to see this</text>
  <text start="428.47" dur="3.54">accelerate because what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="429.7" dur="4.29">right now is that banks they have</text>
  <text start="432.01" dur="3.96">started to tighten their lending</text>
  <text start="433.99" dur="4.92">standards for prime and subprime</text>
  <text start="435.97" dur="5.49">borrowers and especially the automobile</text>
  <text start="438.91" dur="6.03">industry they are going to be hit very</text>
  <text start="441.46" dur="5.49">very hard and what they&amp;#39;re seeing now is</text>
  <text start="444.94" dur="4.17">that there&amp;#39;s too much debt there&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="446.95" dur="5.1">much negative equity in vehicles after</text>
  <text start="449.11" dur="5.019">years of this loosey-goosey lending new</text>
  <text start="452.05" dur="4.75">vehicle prices they&amp;#39;ve moved out</text>
  <text start="454.129" dur="4.891">reach and the banks and the central</text>
  <text start="456.8" dur="3.959">banks they&amp;#39;re starting to reel all this</text>
  <text start="459.02" dur="5.789">in now why are they doing this at this</text>
  <text start="460.759" dur="5.91">point go back to 2007 into 2008 when</text>
  <text start="464.809" dur="3.6">they started to raise interest rates and</text>
  <text start="466.669" dur="3.9">they started to cut back on who they</text>
  <text start="468.409" dur="3.9">were loaning money to this is what they</text>
  <text start="470.569" dur="3.66">do when they&amp;#39;re preparing to bring down</text>
  <text start="472.309" dur="3.12">the economy they do it very slowly to</text>
  <text start="474.229" dur="3.72">make it look like yeah we have nothing</text>
  <text start="475.429" dur="6.121">to do with this but if they do this and</text>
  <text start="477.949" dur="6.27">they are doing it the automobile market</text>
  <text start="481.55" dur="5.459">is going to take a very big hit because</text>
  <text start="484.219" dur="4.32">they depend on loans because people</text>
  <text start="487.009" dur="4.86">don&amp;#39;t walk into the dealership and say</text>
  <text start="488.539" dur="6.3">hey that car&amp;#39;s 40 mm here&amp;#39;s 40 mm in</text>
  <text start="491.869" dur="4.44">cash I&amp;#39;ll take it I mean they might have</text>
  <text start="494.839" dur="3.06">done this before where they were able to</text>
  <text start="496.309" dur="4.11">get equity loans because the houses</text>
  <text start="497.899" dur="4.2">around the area we&amp;#39;re appreciating but</text>
  <text start="500.419" dur="3.661">now we&amp;#39;re not seeing this anymore</text>
  <text start="502.099" dur="3.57">and we can see that the automobile</text>
  <text start="504.08" dur="3.689">industry is going to have a very very</text>
  <text start="505.669" dur="4.29">tough time we see the Cabal they are not</text>
  <text start="507.769" dur="5.4">giving up on this one world government</text>
  <text start="509.959" dur="5.37">we know that Trump he got rid of the TPP</text>
  <text start="513.169" dur="3.691">but we can see right now that the Cabal</text>
  <text start="515.329" dur="5.19">is out there with 11 other countries</text>
  <text start="516.86" dur="6.57">trying to agree on the TPP trying to</text>
  <text start="520.519" dur="3.841">keep this alive because in their minds</text>
  <text start="523.43" dur="2.79">and you have to remember that the way</text>
  <text start="524.36" dur="4.5">they think they think that eventually</text>
  <text start="526.22" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re gonna hit their goal of getting</text>
  <text start="528.86" dur="3.12">everyone to sign on to the TPP and this</text>
  <text start="530.93" dur="3.36">is why they&amp;#39;re trying to keep it alive</text>
  <text start="531.98" dur="4.979">and they have about 11 member nations</text>
  <text start="534.29" dur="6.12">where they found enough common ground on</text>
  <text start="536.959" dur="5.19">core elements to move forward on a final</text>
  <text start="540.41" dur="4.169">agreement but again it doesn&amp;#39;t include</text>
  <text start="542.149" dur="3.901">the United States and I don&amp;#39;t think this</text>
  <text start="544.579" dur="3.75">is gonna go anywhere at this point in</text>
  <text start="546.05" dur="3.99">time unless all of a sudden everything</text>
  <text start="548.329" dur="3.721">switches around and they gain control</text>
  <text start="550.04" dur="3.779">over everything and they&amp;#39;ll and they get</text>
  <text start="552.05" dur="3.75">the United States to join the TPP but at</text>
  <text start="553.819" dur="4.411">this point I don&amp;#39;t see this happening at</text>
  <text start="555.8" dur="4.26">all and we need to understand is that</text>
  <text start="558.23" dur="3.839">the Cabal they&amp;#39;re not going to give up</text>
  <text start="560.06" dur="3.209">but they understand what is happening</text>
  <text start="562.069" dur="3.901">right now the rich the elite the</text>
  <text start="563.269" dur="5.221">insiders they realize what is happening</text>
  <text start="565.97" dur="4.469">right now and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="568.49" dur="4.17">something very interesting now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="570.439" dur="3.75">been talking about the economy we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="572.66" dur="4.89">been talking about protecting your</text>
  <text start="574.189" dur="5.971">wealth and just don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s us</text>
  <text start="577.55" dur="4.409">who&amp;#39;s who&amp;#39;s looking at this and</text>
  <text start="580.16" dur="4.5">protecting our wealth with you know</text>
  <text start="581.959" dur="5.491">we&amp;#39;re buying gold and silver and getting</text>
  <text start="584.66" dur="4.98">supplies and keeping cash on</text>
  <text start="587.45" dur="4.829">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="589.64" dur="5.88">that European elites they are hoarding</text>
  <text start="592.279" dur="5.851">cash the Japanese are stuffing safes</text>

  <text start="600.92" dur="4.8">going on there we&amp;#39;ll discuss that in a</text>
  <text start="602.15" dur="6.12">little bit and the richest Americans are</text>
  <text start="605.72" dur="5.82">getting increasingly concerned about the</text>
  <text start="608.27" dur="6.2">safety of their wealth and what is</text>
  <text start="611.54" dur="6.9">happening here is that they are hiring</text>
  <text start="614.47" dur="7.6">security services now the demand for</text>
  <text start="618.44" dur="6.51">security services it has soared driving</text>
  <text start="622.07" dur="8.22">up wages around twenty four percent</text>
  <text start="624.95" dur="8.37">year-on-year and they&amp;#39;re requesting more</text>
