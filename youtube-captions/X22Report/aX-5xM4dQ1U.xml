  <text start="192.71" dur="7.24">into the spring into the summer and the</text>
  <text start="197.16" dur="6.96">fall we are going to see layoffs pick up</text>
  <text start="199.95" dur="5.49">and accelerate because as the economy</text>
  <text start="204.12" dur="5.07">and I&amp;#39;m talking about the real economic</text>
  <text start="205.44" dur="5.79">indicators continually declines it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="209.19" dur="4.23">just going to get worse and worse and</text>
  <text start="211.23" dur="4.17">companies they&amp;#39;re not gonna have sales</text>
  <text start="213.42" dur="4.68">there&amp;#39;s going to be no revenue coming in</text>
  <text start="215.4" dur="5.75">they could only buy back so much stock</text>

  <text start="221.15" dur="4.33">retail is going to be a disaster and</text>
  <text start="223.53" dur="4.47">stores are going to be closing and</text>
  <text start="225.48" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;ll be layoffs there so all of this</text>
  <text start="228" dur="5.43">is coming to a head right now David</text>
  <text start="230.61" dur="7.29">Stockman is out there and he is saying</text>
  <text start="233.43" dur="9.06">that all the signs are right in front of</text>
  <text start="237.9" dur="8.27">us that we are heading into an over</text>
  <text start="242.49" dur="6.09">whelming implosion business sales</text>
  <text start="246.17" dur="5.2">reported this morning we&amp;#39;re down 5.1</text>
  <text start="248.58" dur="11.85">percent from their July 2014 cyclical</text>
  <text start="251.37" dur="11.16">peak we see declines everywhere we see</text>
  <text start="260.43" dur="4.08">the number of employers who send in</text>
  <text start="262.53" dur="4.02">withholding taxes for seasonally</text>
  <text start="264.51" dur="4.68">adjusted phantom employees is somewhere</text>
  <text start="266.55" dur="4.77">between zero and none nor does the IRS</text>
  <text start="269.19" dur="6.12">even hear from the companies who might</text>
  <text start="271.32" dur="9.3">have died or could have been born we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="275.31" dur="9.6">seeing at this point all sectors of the</text>
  <text start="280.62" dur="6.99">economy start to break down and remember</text>
  <text start="284.91" dur="4.72">the central bankers can only pump things</text>
  <text start="287.61" dur="4.12">up so far</text>
  <text start="289.63" dur="5.25">and eventually what happens is it</text>
  <text start="291.73" dur="4.89">disconnects from reality and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="294.88" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now we see core CPI</text>
  <text start="296.62" dur="5.52">increases by 2.3 percent year-on-year in</text>
  <text start="299.38" dur="7.17">February this is the biggest jump since</text>
  <text start="302.14" dur="6.63">October of 2008 and this is led by the</text>
  <text start="306.55" dur="5.25">biggest monthly surge in apparel prices</text>
  <text start="308.77" dur="5.1">since 2009 now</text>
  <text start="311.8" dur="5.25">housing starts came out and they beat</text>
  <text start="313.87" dur="5.7">expectations we see a slowdown in rental</text>
  <text start="317.05" dur="5.55">permits and we see that the numbers were</text>
  <text start="319.57" dur="4.2">seasonally adjusted once again housing</text>
  <text start="322.6" dur="5.45">starts rose from last month&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="323.77" dur="6.75">disappointing upward revised numbers and</text>
  <text start="328.05" dur="4.72">all of a sudden we have them beat</text>
  <text start="330.52" dur="5.16">expectations but when you look at the</text>
  <text start="332.77" dur="6.24">graph of single home starts or</text>
  <text start="335.68" dur="5.46">multifamily starts we see that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="339.01" dur="5.07">really flat line at this point it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="341.14" dur="6.27">bouncing up and down and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="344.08" dur="5.88">absolutely nowhere we see that mortgage</text>
  <text start="347.41" dur="6.27">applications they have dropped by three</text>
  <text start="349.96" dur="7.14">point three percent and industrial</text>
  <text start="353.68" dur="8.07">production right now collapses most</text>
  <text start="357.1" dur="7.1">since 1952 outside of a recession the</text>
  <text start="361.75" dur="5.73">current decline in US manufacturing</text>
  <text start="364.2" dur="5.85">would be the first time since 1952 that</text>
  <text start="367.48" dur="5.67">industrial production has declined for</text>
  <text start="370.05" dur="6.31">four straight months without the US</text>
  <text start="373.15" dur="5.85">economy not being in a recession it came</text>
  <text start="376.36" dur="4.65">in at worse than expected of 0.5 percent</text>
  <text start="379" dur="4.74">month a month plunge near the worst</text>
  <text start="381.01" dur="5.55">since 2009 and we also see a</text>
  <text start="383.74" dur="6.99">year-on-year drop of 1% the fourth</text>
  <text start="386.56" dur="6.09">monthly decline and we see a crash in</text>
  <text start="390.73" dur="4.56">mining this is the biggest crash in</text>
  <text start="392.65" dur="6.51">mining since 1983 it was down by nine</text>
  <text start="395.29" dur="5.04">point nine percent so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="399.16" dur="3.33">at this point when we look at</text>
  <text start="400.33" dur="6">manufacturing industrial production</text>
  <text start="402.49" dur="9.27">retail sales business sales corporate</text>
  <text start="406.33" dur="8.52">revenue layoffs each one of these things</text>
  <text start="411.76" dur="7.469">is pointing to a major recession</text>
  <text start="414.85" dur="6.16">depression collapse they&amp;#39;re whispering</text>
  <text start="419.229" dur="4.721">to everyone</text>
  <text start="421.01" dur="5.94">we are here forget about the stock</text>
  <text start="423.95" dur="5.28">market forget about what the government</text>
  <text start="426.95" dur="5.16">the central bank&amp;#39;s tell you they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="429.23" dur="6.87">keeping the illusion alive everything is</text>
  <text start="432.11" dur="4.44">awesome until it isn&amp;#39;t everything was</text>
  <text start="436.1" dur="3.87">awesome</text>
  <text start="436.55" dur="5.58">in 2008 everything was awesome when the</text>
  <text start="439.97" dur="4.5">Fed came out and told us everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="442.13" dur="4.68">contained we&amp;#39;re not expecting were</text>
  <text start="444.47" dur="4.02">forecasting any type of recession in the</text>
  <text start="446.81" dur="3.54">year we&amp;#39;re telling you we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="448.49" dur="4.11">forecasting any type of recession and</text>
  <text start="450.35" dur="6.38">that was 2008 and we had a recession in</text>
  <text start="452.6" dur="7.14">October everything is always awesome</text>
  <text start="456.73" dur="4.93">even when we&amp;#39;re in a recession the</text>
  <text start="459.74" dur="5.1">government central bankers try to</text>
  <text start="461.66" dur="7.2">convince everyone that it&amp;#39;s awesome but</text>
  <text start="464.84" dur="6.9">what we see is the complete opposite now</text>
  <text start="468.86" dur="5.31">the Baltic Dry Index has been rising for</text>
  <text start="471.74" dur="6.45">the last couple of weeks most likely a</text>
  <text start="474.17" dur="6.96">dead cat bounce we saw that more ships</text>
  <text start="478.19" dur="6.84">we&amp;#39;re going to be coming online and all</text>
  <text start="481.13" dur="8.34">of a sudden the Baltic Dry Index kind of</text>
  <text start="485.03" dur="8.52">hit the top at 396 and now is falling</text>
  <text start="489.47" dur="6.39">and it&amp;#39;s down to 393 and we see China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="493.55" dur="6.06">containerized Freight index has also</text>
  <text start="495.86" dur="6.27">dropped at the same time and this shows</text>
  <text start="499.61" dur="4.56">us that most likely the voltage right</text>
  <text start="502.13" dur="4.62">index now is on a downward trajectory</text>
  <text start="504.17" dur="4.83">and we kind of thought this was going to</text>
  <text start="506.75" dur="4.23">happen because last week we looked at</text>
  <text start="509" dur="3.87">the Baltic Dry Index we looked at the</text>
  <text start="510.98" dur="3.99">freight rates we looked at what was</text>
  <text start="512.87" dur="3.81">going on and we said most likely that it</text>
  <text start="514.97" dur="5.19">will top out this week and then start to</text>
  <text start="516.68" dur="4.62">fall and here we are and of course the</text>
  <text start="520.16" dur="2.64">corporate media is going to come out and</text>
  <text start="521.3" dur="3.69">tell us that this is no normal</text>
  <text start="522.8" dur="7.11">this is everything is fine we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="524.99" dur="10.32">supposed to be at 380 or 370 except when</text>
  <text start="529.91" dur="9.36">you look back in time to 2012 2011 2008</text>
  <text start="535.31" dur="8.88">2006 2005 all the way back from when its</text>
  <text start="539.27" dur="8.04">first started it was never this low so</text>
  <text start="544.19" dur="7.62">something is wrong something is not</text>
  <text start="547.31" dur="7.14">right in the economy and we know that</text>
  <text start="551.81" dur="5.01">there&amp;#39;s a huge amount of carbon</text>
  <text start="554.45" dur="5.19">printing we know the debt of the</text>
  <text start="556.82" dur="4.86">countries it is not sustainable</text>
  <text start="559.64" dur="5">we know the central bank is creating</text>
  <text start="561.68" dur="7.98">bubble after bubble after bubble and</text>
  <text start="564.64" dur="9.25">when you look at the data we see that US</text>
  <text start="569.66" dur="6.39">manufacturing is signaling a recession</text>
  <text start="573.89" dur="4.47">now remember the Federal Reserve they</text>
  <text start="576.05" dur="4.98">collect this data they survey</text>
  <text start="578.36" dur="5.61">manufacturing businesses and they ask</text>
  <text start="581.03" dur="8.12">factories you know are you shrinking are</text>
  <text start="583.97" dur="5.18">you growing our things unchanged and</text>
  <text start="589.33" dur="6.54">based on what they&amp;#39;ve collected their</text>
  <text start="592.52" dur="7.38">narrative is everything is awesome but</text>
  <text start="595.87" dur="7.81">all the numbers and all the data shows</text>
  <text start="599.9" dur="5.58">that US manufacturing is shrinking or to</text>
  <text start="603.68" dur="5.43">be more clear that we&amp;#39;re in a recession</text>
  <text start="605.48" dur="4.95">right now in Texas for example four</text>
  <text start="609.11" dur="4.47">percent of the business report that they</text>
  <text start="610.43" dur="6.33">are growing sounds good except that 38</text>
  <text start="613.58" dur="5.1">percent are shrinking Philadelphia&amp;#39;s Fed</text>
  <text start="616.76" dur="4.2">Manufacturing Index has been in</text>
  <text start="618.68" dur="4.8">recession since September of last year</text>

  <text start="629.03" dur="6.96">manufacturing index - sixteen point six</text>
  <text start="632.21" dur="9.32">for February the last time the index was</text>
  <text start="635.99" dur="5.54">below fifteen was in October of 2008</text>
  <text start="641.77" dur="5.65">when we look at the data and we compare</text>
  <text start="645.23" dur="4.53">what has happened in the past we saw a</text>
  <text start="647.42" dur="6.26">large downturns and manufacturing and</text>
  <text start="649.76" dur="11.67">industrial production when well 1970</text>
  <text start="653.68" dur="9.87">1974 80 81 90 2001 and 2008 and what</text>
  <text start="661.43" dur="7.82">happened during those periods</text>
  <text start="663.55" dur="11.74">well we entered a major recession and</text>
  <text start="669.25" dur="9.49">this time it&amp;#39;s much worse now when the</text>
  <text start="675.29" dur="7.74">economy completely collapses governments</text>
  <text start="678.74" dur="8.16">always resort to capital controls these</text>
  <text start="683.03" dur="5.28">are the tools they use to trap the</text>
  <text start="686.9" dur="7.74">currency</text>
  <text start="688.31" dur="9.36">in a failing financial system so we know</text>
  <text start="694.64" dur="6.27">at this point when everything starts to</text>
  <text start="697.67" dur="9.99">fall apart they will be pushing capital</text>
  <text start="700.91" dur="9.63">controls and they do this to keep the</text>
  <text start="707.66" dur="5.4">currency inside the banks because they</text>
  <text start="710.54" dur="6.38">don&amp;#39;t want people taking it out because</text>
  <text start="713.06" dur="6.18">remember they have the beylin documents</text>
  <text start="716.92" dur="4.75">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="719.24" dur="8.539">everything is pointing to a major</text>
  <text start="721.67" dur="9.23">collapse and it is much worse than 2008</text>
  <text start="727.779" dur="6.761">because this time the American people</text>
  <text start="730.9" dur="5.41">they&amp;#39;re worse off than 2008 prior to</text>
  <text start="734.54" dur="4.91">2008 people had equity in their homes</text>
  <text start="736.31" dur="5.31">people had good-paying jobs</text>
  <text start="739.45" dur="6.37">we didn&amp;#39;t see as many people on food</text>
  <text start="741.62" dur="6.659">stamps we didn&amp;#39;t see this many stores</text>
  <text start="745.82" dur="5.4">closed actually everything was expanding</text>
  <text start="748.279" dur="6.121">at that time we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="751.22" dur="7.74">corporations layoffs and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="754.4" dur="7.41">lost their wealth during 2008 so this</text>
  <text start="758.96" dur="6.51">time around it&amp;#39;s going to be a complete</text>
  <text start="761.81" dur="9.41">disaster Peter Schiff is warning that</text>
  <text start="765.47" dur="8.28">we&amp;#39;re going to see more layoffs coming</text>
  <text start="771.22" dur="4.06">he says normally employers don&amp;#39;t lay off</text>
  <text start="773.75" dur="5.7">people because they think the recession</text>
  <text start="775.28" dur="6.39">is coming when they get surprised by a</text>
  <text start="779.45" dur="5.7">recession that&amp;#39;s when they start to</text>

  <text start="841.34" dur="3.95">they&amp;#39;ll say listen we we said we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="843.23" dur="5.93">recovery everything was fine until</text>

  <text start="852.71" dur="5.46">everything was perfect right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="855.89" dur="5.16">saying that the global economic</text>
  <text start="858.17" dur="4.02">developments continue to pose a risk but</text>
  <text start="861.05" dur="2.76">here in the United States everything is</text>
  <text start="862.19" dur="3.93">fine it&amp;#39;s everywhere else that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="863.81" dur="5.76">problem so we&amp;#39;re gonna leave rates</text>
  <text start="866.12" dur="7.74">unchanged they&amp;#39;re saying inflation is</text>
  <text start="869.57" dur="6.03">still very low and the data shows there</text>
  <text start="873.86" dur="5.58">is a lot more strength in the labor</text>
  <text start="875.6" dur="6.27">market and they&amp;#39;re basically blaming the</text>
  <text start="879.44" dur="5.67">rest of the world for what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="881.87" dur="6.99">right now but the u.s. is isolated it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="885.11" dur="8.34">fine everything is perfect here and we</text>
  <text start="888.86" dur="9.69">saw this before we know they are lying</text>
  <text start="893.45" dur="6.78">the Federal Reserve is not working for</text>
  <text start="898.55" dur="4.11">the people they are a private</text>
  <text start="900.23" dur="4.8">corporation they have no allegiance to</text>
  <text start="902.66" dur="5.97">any government whatsoever their</text>
  <text start="905.03" dur="7.89">allegiance is to themselves to profit to</text>
  <text start="908.63" dur="7.44">debt that is it and they are not looking</text>
  <text start="912.92" dur="4.38">at the situation and saying okay this is</text>
  <text start="916.07" dur="4.77">what&amp;#39;s really going on because if we</text>
  <text start="917.3" dur="5.76">look in the past they&amp;#39;ve never told the</text>
  <text start="920.84" dur="4.5">truth and going forward</text>
  <text start="923.06" dur="7.26">why would they tell the truth now</text>
  <text start="925.34" dur="7.29">they&amp;#39;re not going to and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="930.32" dur="4.83">wait and wait and even during the</text>
  <text start="932.63" dur="4.89">recession moving into the depression</text>
  <text start="935.15" dur="4.41">going into the collapse where everything</text>
  <text start="937.52" dur="4.05">is falling apart they&amp;#39;ll still try to</text>
  <text start="939.56" dur="4.44">convince everyone that everything is</text>
  <text start="941.57" dur="4.29">fine they&amp;#39;ll say oh we&amp;#39;re doing QE for</text>
  <text start="944" dur="4.35">now because we&amp;#39;re gonna help out the</text>
  <text start="945.86" dur="5.04">situation once again and we can see at</text>
  <text start="948.35" dur="5.43">this point that they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="950.9" dur="4.3">help the situation whatsoever very</text>
  <text start="953.78" dur="4.24">interestingly</text>
  <text start="955.2" dur="6.81">today we know the Fed meeting was going</text>
  <text start="958.02" dur="6.06">to happen and if we go back to three</text>
  <text start="962.01" dur="5.52">four days we saw a gold was suppressed</text>
  <text start="964.08" dur="6.48">quite a bit and today all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="967.53" dur="8.13">right after the Fed meeting gold shot up</text>
  <text start="970.56" dur="6.54">to around thirty plus dollars and this</text>
  <text start="975.66" dur="4.02">is something that we need to watch</text>
  <text start="977.1" dur="4.34">because when gold continually rises and</text>
  <text start="979.68" dur="4.89">it makes higher highs and higher lows</text>
  <text start="981.44" dur="5.71">this gives us a signal that they are</text>
  <text start="984.57" dur="6.93">losing control because when gold hits</text>
  <text start="987.15" dur="6.69">1,300 when gold hits 1,400 and people in</text>
  <text start="991.5" dur="5.07">the stock market hedge funds investors</text>
  <text start="993.84" dur="4.65">and everyone else looks at this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="996.57" dur="3.66">gonna say oh we better get into this and</text>
  <text start="998.49" dur="3.78">that will drive the price up even</text>
  <text start="1000.23" dur="4.5">further and this is when it will be too</text>
  <text start="1002.27" dur="4.77">late listen everyone thanks a lot for</text>
  <text start="1004.73" dur="5.69">listening be well be safe and especially</text>
  <text start="1007.04" dur="3.38">be prepared thanks a lot</text>
