  <text start="48.34" dur="5.95">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="51.4" dur="8.68">political and geopolitical news now the</text>
  <text start="54.29" dur="9.78">murder of Justice Scalia is becoming</text>
  <text start="60.08" dur="7.02">more and more bizarre and all the</text>
  <text start="64.07" dur="6.72">information does not fit this looks like</text>
  <text start="67.1" dur="5.22">this was an assassination and William O</text>
  <text start="70.79" dur="4.41">Ritchie former head of Criminal</text>
  <text start="72.32" dur="5.73">Investigation for DC police said the</text>
  <text start="75.2" dur="6.059">following as a former homicide commander</text>
  <text start="78.05" dur="6.63">he said I am stunned that no autopsy was</text>
  <text start="81.259" dur="6.091">ordered for Justice Scalia you have a</text>
  <text start="84.68" dur="4.89">Supreme Court justice who died not an</text>
  <text start="87.35" dur="4.47">attendance of a physician you have a</text>

  <text start="99.5" dur="5.1">the scene and without any medical</text>
  <text start="101.299" dur="7.291">training and then he died of a heart</text>
  <text start="104.6" dur="6.769">attack what medical proof exists that</text>
  <text start="108.59" dur="7.23">there was a heart attack why not a</text>
  <text start="111.369" dur="7.631">cerebral hemorrhage how can the marshal</text>
  <text start="115.82" dur="5.85">say without a thorough postmortem</text>
  <text start="119" dur="5.04">that he was not injected with an illegal</text>
  <text start="121.67" dur="6.92">substance that would simulate a heart</text>
  <text start="124.04" dur="7.53">attack very interestingly Scalia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="128.59" dur="7.03">federal protection was removed while he</text>
  <text start="131.57" dur="6.69">was at the Texas ranch he we were told</text>
  <text start="135.62" dur="7.26">now remember this is not coming from him</text>
  <text start="138.26" dur="7.229">this is coming from the mouthpieces that</text>
  <text start="142.88" dur="5.52">are telling us what happened there he</text>
  <text start="145.489" dur="7.621">didn&amp;#39;t want protection maybe he did</text>
  <text start="148.4" dur="6.839">maybe he didn&amp;#39;t Scalia&amp;#39;s family is out</text>
  <text start="153.11" dur="3.78">there saying they didn&amp;#39;t want an autopsy</text>
  <text start="155.239" dur="6.411">but we actually didn&amp;#39;t hear from the</text>
  <text start="156.89" dur="6.23">family the family has been silent and</text>
  <text start="161.65" dur="3.559">their statement</text>
  <text start="163.12" dur="6.179">as of this point have not been reported</text>
  <text start="165.209" dur="8.56">and then we have this pillow over his</text>
  <text start="169.299" dur="6.991">head and then we have the judge Groh</text>
  <text start="173.769" dur="5.151">vara deciding without seeing the body</text>
  <text start="176.29" dur="6.57">that Scalia died from natural causes</text>
  <text start="178.92" dur="5.95">ruled against doing an OP Topsy and a</text>
  <text start="182.86" dur="5.129">counter opinion offered unofficially but</text>
  <text start="184.87" dur="8.479">in by another Texas judge Bishop that</text>
  <text start="187.989" dur="5.36">she would have had some type of autopsy</text>
  <text start="193.92" dur="9.789">so something is definitely going on here</text>
  <text start="197.769" dur="10.161">and this is not normally what you would</text>
  <text start="203.709" dur="7.771">see when someone passes away naturally</text>
  <text start="207.93" dur="5.889">you would see the medical examiner you</text>
  <text start="211.48" dur="6.11">would see them taking the body doing an</text>
  <text start="213.819" dur="9.301">autopsy you would see all of this and</text>
  <text start="217.59" dur="9.79">the question is why did they want this</text>
  <text start="223.12" dur="9.57">judge out of the way what was the</text>
  <text start="227.38" dur="7.949">purpose of this well right now Obama</text>
  <text start="232.69" dur="5.699">could use recess appointment to bypass</text>
  <text start="235.329" dur="4.651">Congress and install a new justice the</text>
  <text start="238.389" dur="3.63">window is still open on President</text>
  <text start="239.98" dur="4.28">Obama&amp;#39;s option of replacing late Supreme</text>
  <text start="242.019" dur="4.891">Court justice with a recess appointment</text>
  <text start="244.26" dur="5.05">the Senate is in the middle of a ten day</text>
  <text start="246.91" dur="5.34">recess until Monday giving mr. Obama a</text>
  <text start="249.31" dur="7.59">chance to bypass Congress and install a</text>
  <text start="252.25" dur="9.479">successor quickly will he do this</text>
  <text start="256.9" dur="9.69">we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see but what we</text>
  <text start="261.729" dur="5.22">also know is there was a vote on climate</text>
  <text start="266.59" dur="2.97">change</text>
  <text start="266.949" dur="7.981">you know the whole meeting during the</text>
  <text start="269.56" dur="8.31">false flag in Paris when we had the hoax</text>
  <text start="274.93" dur="3.15">that the Islamic state was coming to get</text>
  <text start="277.87" dur="2.519">us</text>
  <text start="278.08" dur="4.23">this was dirt there&amp;#39;s during the same</text>
  <text start="280.389" dur="4.71">time that all the countries were meeting</text>
  <text start="282.31" dur="7.32">to talk about climate change global</text>
  <text start="285.099" dur="8.661">warming carbon taxes and remember the US</text>
  <text start="289.63" dur="7.11">Supreme Court this month put a hold</text>
  <text start="293.76" dur="8.73">regulations to curb carbon</text>
  <text start="296.74" dur="9.72">side mainly from coal-fired power plants</text>
  <text start="302.49" dur="11.28">which might delay the formal signature</text>
  <text start="306.46" dur="7.31">of the Paris agreement now if you remove</text>
  <text start="314.37" dur="9.49">Justice Scalia and you play someone else</text>
  <text start="319.3" dur="8.519">in there guess what you can have the</text>
  <text start="323.86" dur="7.38">agenda move forward you can have the</text>
  <text start="327.819" dur="7.611">Supreme Court turn the decision and say</text>
  <text start="331.24" dur="9.239">okay we agree with the white house and</text>
  <text start="335.43" dur="7.209">we see that they&amp;#39;re going to have this</text>
  <text start="340.479" dur="4.53">signed because they don&amp;#39;t care what the</text>
  <text start="342.639" dur="5.581">Supreme Court says so this shows us that</text>
  <text start="345.009" dur="6">they already know when they place the</text>
  <text start="348.22" dur="7.229">new justice in power that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="351.009" dur="8.551">to reverse this decision and this is</text>
  <text start="355.449" dur="7.44">very interesting now we know that</text>
  <text start="359.56" dur="6.479">students who are going to college they</text>
  <text start="362.889" dur="6.9">end up with a lot of debt because they</text>
  <text start="366.039" dur="5.97">can&amp;#39;t find the jobs out there on average</text>
  <text start="369.789" dur="3.541">every student has between thirty and</text>
  <text start="372.009" dur="4.231">thirty five thousand dollars worth of</text>
  <text start="373.33" dur="5.22">debt and what&amp;#39;s very interesting at this</text>
  <text start="376.24" dur="6.03">point and we know there&amp;#39;s trillions and</text>
  <text start="378.55" dur="6.899">trillions of dollars in debt outstanding</text>
  <text start="382.27" dur="4.619">and a lot of these students have loan</text>
  <text start="385.449" dur="3.421">modifications because they can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="386.889" dur="5.551">jobs they&amp;#39;re part-time jobs living with</text>
  <text start="388.87" dur="7.229">their parents and those people who are</text>
  <text start="392.44" dur="6.979">behind on student loans they might get a</text>
  <text start="396.099" dur="7.051">visit from the US Marshal office in</text>
  <text start="399.419" dur="6.761">Texas the US Marshal Service in Houston</text>
  <text start="403.15" dur="6.079">is arresting people who aren&amp;#39;t paying</text>

  <text start="413.56" dur="8.13">showed up at his Houston home in combat</text>
  <text start="417.009" dur="9.141">gear so they needed seven deputies in</text>
  <text start="421.69" dur="8.64">combat gear to go after a student a an</text>
  <text start="426.15" dur="8.71">adult who didn&amp;#39;t pay the student loan</text>
  <text start="430.33" dur="5.82">does that make sense and Paul acre was</text>

  <text start="436.15" dur="5.46">here why are they at my home I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="438.4" dur="7.319">done anything and they were there to</text>

  <text start="445.719" dur="5.79">of student loans that I received in 1987</text>
  <text start="448.78" dur="7.909">and he said this was totally</text>
  <text start="451.509" dur="8.641">mind-boggling and they brought him in to</text>
  <text start="456.689" dur="9.641">into court and they set up a payment</text>
  <text start="460.15" dur="7.319">plan to have him pay this off but the US</text>

  <text start="597.61" dur="4.649">nervous</text>

  <text start="681.699" dur="6.57">back by force and this is something that</text>
  <text start="685.24" dur="5.61">we need to be aware of that eventually</text>

  <text start="807.61" dur="4.92">didn&amp;#39;t provide any proof of this and</text>
  <text start="809.64" dur="5.14">Russia says there are no ships in the</text>

  <text start="830.56" dur="5.31">in the world would anyone believe turkey</text>
  <text start="832.72" dur="5.34">or the US at this point in time they</text>
  <text start="835.87" dur="4.38">have lied so many times they make</text>
  <text start="838.06" dur="5.16">propaganda statements and they never</text>
  <text start="840.25" dur="4.38">ever back it up with any proof</text>
  <text start="843.22" dur="5.97">whatsoever</text>
  <text start="844.63" dur="8.899">I mean turkey in the last 24 hours they</text>
  <text start="849.19" dur="6.6">have violated Greek airspace 22 times</text>
  <text start="853.529" dur="2.651">you don&amp;#39;t see the Greeks shooting them</text>
  <text start="855.79" dur="4.049">down</text>
  <text start="856.18" dur="6.51">do you now Turkey is continually</text>
  <text start="859.839" dur="5.491">shelling into Syria this is the fourth</text>
  <text start="862.69" dur="6.54">day now in a row they have not stopped</text>
  <text start="865.33" dur="7.29">and we can see that the window is</text>
  <text start="869.23" dur="6.84">closing they&amp;#39;re bombing the Syrian area</text>
  <text start="872.62" dur="6.39">the Kurdish area to keep this corridor</text>
  <text start="876.07" dur="5.91">open so they can keep the supply lines</text>
  <text start="879.01" dur="5.19">open to the Islamic state and Russia</text>
  <text start="881.98" dur="4.32">continually points us out that they yes</text>
  <text start="884.2" dur="4.829">they are supplying the terrorists</text>
  <text start="886.3" dur="5.52">because Aleppo is falling right now and</text>
  <text start="889.029" dur="6.751">they&amp;#39;re running at a time the window is</text>
  <text start="891.82" dur="9.11">closing very quickly in this area this</text>
  <text start="895.78" dur="8.79">is the Azaz corridor now Turkey is</text>
  <text start="900.93" dur="6.04">continually pushing the idea that there</text>
  <text start="904.57" dur="7.25">needs to be a no-fly zone a safe zone</text>
  <text start="906.97" dur="9.119">and they need it because of these</text>
  <text start="911.82" dur="6.37">600,000 Syrians that are all on the</text>
  <text start="916.089" dur="4.321">border and we need to have this safe</text>
  <text start="918.19" dur="5.04">zone so Turkey is planning to send</text>
  <text start="920.41" dur="6.87">troops 10 kilometers into Syria to</text>
  <text start="923.23" dur="8.28">establish this safe zone this is what</text>
  <text start="927.28" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re planning right now to do now are</text>
  <text start="931.51" dur="4.41">they going to be successful in doing</text>
  <text start="932.65" dur="7.68">this most likely not because if they do</text>
  <text start="935.92" dur="7.68">invade at this point this is going to be</text>
  <text start="940.33" dur="7.62">a very big problem now we know at this</text>
  <text start="943.6" dur="7.92">point that turkey Saudi Arabia and many</text>
  <text start="947.95" dur="5.43">other countries not the u.s. not the UK</text>
  <text start="951.52" dur="5.819">even though they&amp;#39;re orchestrating all of</text>
  <text start="953.38" dur="7.62">this they are having drills at the same</text>
  <text start="957.339" dur="5.311">time now as Saudi Arabia going to invade</text>
  <text start="961" dur="2.73">Turkey now that would be a suicide</text>
  <text start="962.65" dur="2.999">mission first of all</text>
  <text start="963.73" dur="4.2">look they can&amp;#39;t even do anything in</text>
  <text start="965.649" dur="5.911">Yemen and second of all their resources</text>
  <text start="967.93" dur="6">are tied up in Yemen right now and most</text>
  <text start="971.56" dur="4.62">of the soldiers that they have are paid</text>
  <text start="973.93" dur="6.45">mercenaries right now in Turkey the</text>
  <text start="976.18" dur="7.26">aircraft and everything else and this is</text>
  <text start="980.38" dur="5.91">why Carter was going around trying to</text>
  <text start="983.44" dur="5.16">put this coalition together for this</text>
  <text start="986.29" dur="3.75">major major offensive now it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="988.6" dur="3.06">be very difficult for them just a march</text>
  <text start="990.04" dur="4.44">in there because that is a complete and</text>
  <text start="991.66" dur="5.28">utter invasion it will be open to the</text>
  <text start="994.48" dur="4.95">world to see and this would be a huge</text>
  <text start="996.94" dur="4.829">problem in the meantime while all this</text>
  <text start="999.43" dur="5.099">is going on the tiger forces the special</text>
  <text start="1001.769" dur="5.76">forces elite unit of the Syrian Arab</text>
  <text start="1004.529" dur="5.221">army just entered the strategic thermal</text>
  <text start="1007.529" dur="8.37">power plant located in eastern Aleppo</text>
  <text start="1009.75" dur="12.149">and we can see part of the plan here</text>
  <text start="1015.899" dur="9.481">with the US with NATO with Turkey is to</text>
  <text start="1021.899" dur="5.641">confuse the situation that Turkey and</text>
  <text start="1025.38" dur="5.13">these other nations are doing this the</text>
  <text start="1027.54" dur="4.95">u.s. the UK and the Western nations we</text>
  <text start="1030.51" dur="5.1">have nothing to do with this we want</text>
  <text start="1032.49" dur="5.91">them to stop we we don&amp;#39;t want them to do</text>
  <text start="1035.61" dur="4.199">this but you have to remember Turkey is</text>
  <text start="1038.4" dur="4.89">a NATO member</text>
  <text start="1039.809" dur="4.831">and remember NATO has AWAC planes they</text>
  <text start="1043.29" dur="2.7">were thinking about bringing troops in</text>
  <text start="1044.64" dur="3.9">so they have troop build-up there</text>
  <text start="1045.99" dur="7.23">they&amp;#39;re bringing in military assets into</text>
  <text start="1048.54" dur="10.759">Turkey and if something should happen</text>
  <text start="1053.22" dur="10.4">and Turkey gets involved somehow someway</text>
  <text start="1059.299" dur="9.851">remember the NATO treaty article 5</text>
  <text start="1063.62" dur="8.799">collective defence which means that an</text>
  <text start="1069.15" dur="9.18">attack against one ally is considered an</text>
  <text start="1072.419" dur="7.621">attack against all allies and it seems</text>
  <text start="1078.33" dur="2.42">that this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="1080.04" dur="5.1">at this point</text>
  <text start="1080.75" dur="7.63">so basically when Syria and Russia</text>
  <text start="1085.14" dur="7.4">respond to turkeys aggression by counter</text>
  <text start="1088.38" dur="6.419">invading turkey or firing back on Turkey</text>
  <text start="1092.54" dur="4.82">they&amp;#39;re going to use this and this is</text>
  <text start="1094.799" dur="6.191">why they&amp;#39;re holding off</text>
  <text start="1097.36" dur="7.08">why they&amp;#39;re not pushing this very hard</text>
  <text start="1100.99" dur="5.34">this is why Syria and Russia went to the</text>
  <text start="1104.44" dur="4.8">UN and is calling out to the world</text>
  <text start="1106.33" dur="5.67">saying loose look look at this turkey is</text>
  <text start="1109.24" dur="6.12">firing on a sovereign nation this is an</text>
  <text start="1112" dur="7.62">act of war and Syria is not acting</text>
  <text start="1115.36" dur="7.77">neither is Russia but you could see that</text>
  <text start="1119.62" dur="6.09">Turkey NATO the US they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="1123.13" dur="6.87">pushing this because look at this the</text>
  <text start="1125.71" dur="7.02">drill that they&amp;#39;re having is immense</text>
  <text start="1130" dur="5.34">it&amp;#39;s Saudi Arabia Jordan Bahrain Senegal</text>
  <text start="1132.73" dur="5.76">Oman Qatar United Arab Emirates Sudan</text>
  <text start="1135.34" dur="7.68">Kuwait Morocco Pakistan Chad</text>
  <text start="1138.49" dur="6.48">Tunisia Djibouti Malaysia Egypt and it</text>
  <text start="1143.02" dur="4.32">consists of three hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="1144.97" dur="3.959">thousand soldiers twenty thousand takes</text>
  <text start="1147.34" dur="3.48">two thousand four hundred fifty</text>
  <text start="1148.929" dur="5.221">warplanes and four hundred and sixty</text>
  <text start="1150.82" dur="7.32">military helicopters are all in this for</text>
  <text start="1154.15" dur="7.04">this military exercise right now at this</text>
  <text start="1158.14" dur="5.61">point what a coincidence</text>
  <text start="1161.19" dur="8.5">that this is just happening all at the</text>
  <text start="1163.75" dur="9.71">same time now if they cannot get the</text>
  <text start="1169.69" dur="7.02">serene forces or Russia to do something</text>
  <text start="1173.46" dur="8.02">the window is closing Russia and Syria</text>
  <text start="1176.71" dur="7.83">are closing the corridor we know that</text>
  <text start="1181.48" dur="5.76">turkey the US UK the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="1184.54" dur="6.42">are going to lose Aleppo this is going</text>
  <text start="1187.24" dur="9.929">to be a major problem the window is</text>
  <text start="1190.96" dur="8.52">closing which means that the u.s. the</text>
  <text start="1197.169" dur="8.63">coalition forces are going to have to</text>
  <text start="1199.48" dur="9.18">make it look like that Russia or Syria</text>
  <text start="1205.799" dur="8.26">may be attacked turkey or the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1208.66" dur="12.33">state attacked the u.s. the UK Europe</text>
  <text start="1214.059" dur="10.441">they need an event so big that it will</text>
  <text start="1220.99" dur="6.72">shock the world because remember they</text>
  <text start="1224.5" dur="5.46">want you to go to war this is not a</text>
  <text start="1227.71" dur="3.55">fight against Assad this is not a fight</text>
  <text start="1229.96" dur="3.7">against the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1231.26" dur="5.4">this is a fight because the system is</text>
  <text start="1233.66" dur="4.85">crashing and collapsing they know it</text>
  <text start="1236.66" dur="5.34">they only have a certain period of time</text>
  <text start="1238.51" dur="5.41">the war would basically distract</text>
  <text start="1242" dur="6">everyone from what&amp;#39;s really going on all</text>
  <text start="1243.92" dur="5.73">eyes would be on the war now they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1248" dur="4.29">tell you since we&amp;#39;re collapsing and the</text>
  <text start="1249.65" dur="6.87">dollars dying we should go to war so</text>
  <text start="1252.29" dur="5.76">they need to do something big and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1256.52" dur="5.28">going to have to be big and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1258.05" dur="6.48">gonna have to make it seem like this is</text>
  <text start="1261.8" dur="5.28">the reason we need to go it&amp;#39;s gonna have</text>
  <text start="1264.53" dur="5.1">to be believable and it&amp;#39;s gonna have to</text>
  <text start="1267.08" dur="4.71">kill many people I don&amp;#39;t think they can</text>
  <text start="1269.63" dur="5.34">get away with this being a complete and</text>
  <text start="1271.79" dur="4.68">utter hoax this most likely will be a</text>
  <text start="1274.97" dur="3.72">dirty nuke and we know Israel has been</text>
  <text start="1276.47" dur="3.84">testing dirty nukes in the desert it</text>
  <text start="1278.69" dur="4.14">could be a chemical biological weapon</text>
  <text start="1280.31" dur="5.73">this might even be coupled with a cyber</text>
  <text start="1282.83" dur="4.83">attack on the financial system and that</text>
  <text start="1286.04" dur="4.32">could be coming from China or Russia in</text>
  <text start="1287.66" dur="5.16">North Korea but whatever they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1290.36" dur="8.55">to do it&amp;#39;s going to have to be pretty</text>

  <text start="1298.91" dur="7.29">time to go into Syria it&amp;#39;s time to pass</text>
