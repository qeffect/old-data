  <text start="35.89" dur="5.61">episode 899 and today&amp;#39;s date is februari</text>
  <text start="39.22" dur="5.25">20th 2016 and the thought of the episode</text>
  <text start="41.5" dur="5.85">is the current economic collapse news</text>
  <text start="44.47" dur="5.61">brief let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="47.35" dur="4.65">collapse news now as we move throughout</text>
  <text start="50.08" dur="4.26">this year we&amp;#39;re going to see the economy</text>
  <text start="52" dur="4.77">slowly deteriorate and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="54.34" dur="5.19">accelerate as we move further and</text>
  <text start="56.77" dur="5.88">further into this year many individuals</text>
  <text start="59.53" dur="5.07">like bill halter wolf street they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="62.65" dur="5.579">been telling us to look at the credit</text>
  <text start="64.6" dur="7.019">markets and the reason we watch the</text>
  <text start="68.229" dur="7.291">credit markets it&amp;#39;s because credit leads</text>
  <text start="71.619" dur="5.101">equities and this always happens by</text>
  <text start="75.52" dur="4.11">looking at some of these</text>
  <text start="76.72" dur="6.09">investment-grade spreads credit actually</text>
  <text start="79.63" dur="6.33">has deteriorated during the rally this</text>
  <text start="82.81" dur="6.99">is the opposite of what you really want</text>
  <text start="85.96" dur="5.61">to see when spreads widened out this</text>
  <text start="89.8" dur="3.99">means the market is demanding a higher</text>
  <text start="91.57" dur="4.92">rate of interest for riskier corporate</text>
  <text start="93.79" dur="4.92">bonds for his government&amp;#39;s markets only</text>
  <text start="96.49" dur="6.06">do this when conditions are getting</text>
  <text start="98.71" dur="5.43">worse and tighter and just in the past</text>
  <text start="102.55" dur="3.84">couple days we&amp;#39;ve seen this small little</text>
  <text start="104.14" dur="5.429">bounce in equities now there might be a</text>
  <text start="106.39" dur="5.55">little bit more to go with this but what</text>
  <text start="109.569" dur="5.431">we are seeing is that this whole thing</text>
  <text start="111.94" dur="5.039">is going to get a lot worse in March and</text>
  <text start="115" dur="3.99">I don&amp;#39;t think March is going to be a</text>
  <text start="116.979" dur="3.301">pretty much I think things are going to</text>
  <text start="118.99" dur="3.18">look pretty bad in March and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="120.28" dur="5.339">to have to wait to see and watch what</text>
  <text start="122.17" dur="7.44">happens at this point now we see Russia</text>
  <text start="125.619" dur="6.691">the MP Robert believes that the osce and</text>
  <text start="129.61" dur="4.37">the UN must investigate a recent US</text>
  <text start="132.31" dur="6.09">congressman&amp;#39;s confession to</text>
  <text start="133.98" dur="7.96">participating in the CIA&amp;#39;s electronic</text>
  <text start="138.4" dur="5.97">operations because what has happened is</text>
  <text start="141.94" dur="5.37">the CIA operator turn Republican</text>
  <text start="144.37" dur="6.63">congressman will heard he was talking to</text>
  <text start="147.31" dur="7.35">the press and he kind of led it out that</text>
  <text start="151" dur="8.04">he participated in some offensive cyber</text>
  <text start="154.66" dur="6.84">operation against Russia and it looks</text>
  <text start="159.04" dur="5.25">like this is a violation of the 2015</text>
  <text start="161.5" dur="4.379">Russia initiated resolution titled devel</text>
  <text start="164.29" dur="3.089">in the field of information and</text>
  <text start="165.879" dur="4.11">telecommunications in the context of</text>
  <text start="167.379" dur="5.7">international security and they</text>
  <text start="169.989" dur="5.31">basically want the UN to look into this</text>
  <text start="173.079" dur="5.22">to see if the United States violated</text>
  <text start="175.299" dur="5.791">this and we see that the United States</text>
  <text start="178.299" dur="6.78">they have been planning and using cyber</text>
  <text start="181.09" dur="6.33">attacks on many different nations we see</text>
  <text start="185.079" dur="5.341">out in Ukraine Joe Biden and president</text>
  <text start="187.42" dur="5.67">poroshenko they had a phone call to</text>
  <text start="190.42" dur="5.67">discuss what pressure they can put on</text>
  <text start="193.09" dur="6.599">Russia to ensure the implementation of</text>
  <text start="196.09" dur="5.28">the Minsk deal now as we know the</text>
  <text start="199.689" dur="4.651">southeastern section have lived up to</text>
  <text start="201.37" dur="4.53">their end of the bargain and Russia</text>
  <text start="204.34" dur="3.84">right now is saying if you look at the</text>
  <text start="205.9" dur="4.949">Mint&amp;#39;s to ceasefire agreement the only</text>
  <text start="208.18" dur="4.559">thing is left is for Kiev to follow up</text>
  <text start="210.849" dur="4.56">on this but if you notice the United</text>
  <text start="212.739" dur="5.101">States government Ukraine they love to</text>
  <text start="215.409" dur="7.491">drag things out they don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="217.84" dur="7.92">Mint&amp;#39;s to cease fire completed why</text>
  <text start="222.9" dur="5.35">because they&amp;#39;re planning something very</text>
  <text start="225.76" dur="6.03">large and that&amp;#39;s an offensive on the</text>
  <text start="228.25" dur="5.22">southeastern section and Crimea this is</text>
  <text start="231.79" dur="6.089">why they haven&amp;#39;t completed what other</text>
  <text start="233.47" dur="6.57">reason would they not complete this if</text>
  <text start="237.879" dur="6.78">you really look at the mints to cease</text>
  <text start="240.04" dur="7.229">fire it&amp;#39;s up to Kiev to complete the</text>
  <text start="244.659" dur="6.271">deal and no one is putting pressure on</text>
  <text start="247.269" dur="5.731">Kiev whatsoever now Russia realizes</text>
  <text start="250.93" dur="5.669">what&amp;#39;s going on they&amp;#39;re reactivating a</text>
  <text start="253" dur="6.03">military airfield in Crimea and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="256.599" dur="4.44">renovating it right now Russia is also</text>
  <text start="259.03" dur="4.62">deploying advanced aircraft to Armenia</text>
  <text start="261.039" dur="5.041">we see make 29 fighter jets being moved</text>
  <text start="263.65" dur="5.579">into this area and we see this around</text>
  <text start="266.08" dur="5.67">the world where Russia China and other</text>
  <text start="269.229" dur="4.951">nations are looking at all the movements</text>
  <text start="271.75" dur="5.07">of the military assets of the United</text>
  <text start="274.18" dur="3.989">States and NATO and they&amp;#39;re sanctums as</text>
  <text start="276.82" dur="4.439">well if they&amp;#39;re going to be moving a</text>
  <text start="278.169" dur="5.43">missile system into this area we need to</text>
  <text start="281.259" dur="5.581">protect ourselves we need to put</text>
  <text start="283.599" dur="5.671">defensive missile systems in place we</text>
  <text start="286.84" dur="5.009">need to have jets in order but what</text>
  <text start="289.27" dur="4.86">happens in the corporate media and the</text>
  <text start="291.849" dur="4.531">US government we never see the part</text>
  <text start="294.13" dur="3.92">where or they never report on the part</text>
  <text start="296.38" dur="5.27">where the u.s. is moving all these</text>
  <text start="298.05" dur="6.359">into certain areas first all they do is</text>
  <text start="301.65" dur="4.769">then show the other country where</text>
  <text start="304.409" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re saying oh we have to put our</text>
  <text start="306.419" dur="3">missile systems here and the u.s. makes</text>
  <text start="308.159" dur="3.54">a big deal like oh my God look what they</text>
  <text start="309.419" dur="4.081">just did there&amp;#39;s no reason for it well</text>
  <text start="311.699" dur="4.231">there was a reason for it and that was</text>
  <text start="313.5" dur="4.56">because the United States and NATO moved</text>
  <text start="315.93" dur="5.01">their military assets into certain</text>
  <text start="318.06" dur="6.329">positions we see it happening with China</text>
  <text start="320.94" dur="5.49">we see it happening with Russia we know</text>
  <text start="324.389" dur="4.291">that the United States flew in and</text>
  <text start="326.43" dur="4.53">bombed Libya we know it was not bombing</text>
  <text start="328.68" dur="3.69">the Islamic state it is by embalming the</text>
  <text start="330.96" dur="3.929">elected government and the people who</text>
  <text start="332.37" dur="5.4">oppose a puppet government inside of</text>
  <text start="334.889" dur="4.71">Libya and the eliminate Libyan elected</text>
  <text start="337.77" dur="3.66">government has now condemned the US</text>
  <text start="339.599" dur="4.051">airstrikes they&amp;#39;re saying these were</text>
  <text start="341.43" dur="5.25">unsanctioned and they flew into a</text>
  <text start="343.65" dur="5.46">sovereign country Wow were hearing a lot</text>
  <text start="346.68" dur="4.289">of countries coming out saying that the</text>
  <text start="349.11" dur="4.739">US is doing these things illegally</text>
  <text start="350.969" dur="5.91">without permission and they&amp;#39;re attacking</text>
  <text start="353.849" dur="8.85">sovereign countries Syria for one Iraq</text>
  <text start="356.879" dur="7.59">for another Libya Yemen it&amp;#39;s amazing we</text>
  <text start="362.699" dur="4.171">see the Syrian army they have regained</text>
  <text start="364.469" dur="3.75">control of aleppo&amp;#39;s heating plant we</text>
  <text start="366.87" dur="3.21">know the United States government and</text>
  <text start="368.219" dur="4.471">the coalition forces they came in they</text>
  <text start="370.08" dur="6.059">bombed the heating plant the electrical</text>
  <text start="372.69" dur="5.31">infrastructure to shut it all down so</text>
  <text start="376.139" dur="3.571">the people in that area would suffer it</text>
  <text start="378" dur="3.84">would give the advantage to the Islamic</text>
  <text start="379.71" dur="4.47">state and the rebel groups and we can</text>
  <text start="381.84" dur="5.1">see right now that the Syrian army they</text>
  <text start="384.18" dur="5.459">have captured it back and most of Aleppo</text>
  <text start="386.94" dur="5.43">they were running on generators and</text>
  <text start="389.639" dur="3.81">gasoline tankers for power and it seems</text>
  <text start="392.37" dur="3.12">like they&amp;#39;re trying to bring everything</text>
  <text start="393.449" dur="5.101">back up because now they have the two</text>
  <text start="395.49" dur="4.679">stations the heating area and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="398.55" dur="6.51">trying to bring power back to the entire</text>
  <text start="400.169" dur="7.021">area now the Syrian opposition which is</text>
  <text start="405.06" dur="5.46">paid for by the United States government</text>
  <text start="407.19" dur="6.99">central bankers says yes we will have a</text>
  <text start="410.52" dur="7.29">temporary truce with Russia if Russia</text>
  <text start="414.18" dur="7.049">stops bombing the Islamic state al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="417.81" dur="4.8">al-nusrah and we will then think about</text>
  <text start="421.229" dur="4.231">peace so they&amp;#39;re giving them an</text>
  <text start="422.61" dur="4.229">ultimatum and we see this happen a lot</text>
  <text start="425.46" dur="3.389">we saw what happened in Ukraine will</text>
  <text start="426.839" dur="4.021">poroshenko says this we want peace as</text>
  <text start="428.849" dur="3.101">long as you lay down your weapons and we</text>
  <text start="430.86" dur="3.04">take over the entire</text>
  <text start="431.95" dur="3.96">the eastern area we saw what happened in</text>
  <text start="433.9" dur="4.35">Libya we see it happening in Yemen and</text>
  <text start="435.91" dur="4.71">now we&amp;#39;re seeing it in Syria well here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="438.25" dur="4.08">our ultimatum stop bombing the terrorist</text>
  <text start="440.62" dur="4.44">groups and we&amp;#39;ll talk about peace which</text>
  <text start="442.33" dur="5.58">absolutely makes no sense whatsoever we</text>
  <text start="445.06" dur="5.91">see Kerry and Lavrov they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="447.91" dur="6.27">the cessation of hostilities has not</text>
  <text start="450.97" dur="7.05">been fully agreed upon and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="454.18" dur="8.45">saying to implement this both sides need</text>
  <text start="458.02" dur="7.86">to coordinate military engagements</text>
  <text start="462.63" dur="4.87">inside of Syria and of course John</text>
  <text start="465.88" dur="3.75">Kerry&amp;#39;s out there yes we do agree with</text>
  <text start="467.5" dur="3.72">that we need to coordinate which we know</text>
  <text start="469.63" dur="3.84">the United States is never going to</text>
  <text start="471.22" dur="4.08">coordinate with Russia it&amp;#39;d be nice if</text>
  <text start="473.47" dur="3.54">they did because then it would show that</text>
  <text start="475.3" dur="4.05">yes they&amp;#39;re all going after the same</text>
  <text start="477.01" dur="4.74">thing and that is the Islamic state but</text>
  <text start="479.35" dur="4.77">at this point we see that this is not</text>
  <text start="481.75" dur="3.99">really not what they&amp;#39;re trying to do we</text>
  <text start="484.12" dur="4.38">see that the ceasefire talks are</text>
  <text start="485.74" dur="4.53">rescheduled now for februari 25th and</text>
  <text start="488.5" dur="5.85">that is going to be held in the swiss</text>
  <text start="490.27" dur="5.49">city of montreux and we will have to see</text>
  <text start="494.35" dur="5.04">how this turns out because at this point</text>
  <text start="495.76" dur="5.91">in time it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like what the US</text>
  <text start="499.39" dur="6.06">is saying and what they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="501.67" dur="6.6">doing are the same thing now turkey is</text>
  <text start="505.45" dur="5.58">out there and they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="508.27" dur="5.07">u.s. is acting like an enemy it demands</text>
  <text start="511.03" dur="5.55">Washington brand the Kurds as terrorists</text>
  <text start="513.34" dur="5.25">now this is starting to look like they</text>
  <text start="516.58" dur="3.99">want Turkey to look like it&amp;#39;s the rogue</text>
  <text start="518.59" dur="6.66">nation like they&amp;#39;re just completely out</text>
  <text start="520.57" dur="7.23">of control and we hear the United States</text>
  <text start="525.25" dur="8.46">saying yeah you shouldn&amp;#39;t be doing that</text>
  <text start="527.8" dur="8.43">turkey don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t fire upon syria or</text>
  <text start="533.71" dur="4.74">something like that you know but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="536.23" dur="6.24">really not forceful about it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="538.45" dur="6.6">just going along and using lip service</text>
  <text start="542.47" dur="5.82">because when we look at what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="545.05" dur="5.39">going on and we see the actions of the</text>
  <text start="548.29" dur="4.59">united states it&amp;#39;s completely different</text>
  <text start="550.44" dur="5.68">so we know there was a UN Security</text>
  <text start="552.88" dur="6.38">Council resolution 2254 which calls for</text>
  <text start="556.12" dur="4.74">a ceasefire in Syria a ceasefire</text>
  <text start="559.26" dur="3.31">unconditional according to the</text>
  <text start="560.86" dur="4.59">resolution would be for the whole</text>
  <text start="562.57" dur="4.56">country but would exclude</text>
  <text start="565.45" dur="4.62">in groups and we know what those groups</text>
  <text start="567.13" dur="6.78">are l nusrah we know it&amp;#39;s the Islamic</text>
  <text start="570.07" dur="6.45">state we know it&amp;#39;s al Qaeda and any</text>
  <text start="573.91" dur="5.37">other terrorist organization this is why</text>
  <text start="576.52" dur="5.1">Russia wanted the list who are the</text>
  <text start="579.28" dur="4.68">terrorist organizations who are the</text>
  <text start="581.62" dur="3.87">rebels but of course the United States</text>
  <text start="583.96" dur="5.45">didn&amp;#39;t want to hand this over and they</text>
  <text start="585.49" dur="7.56">still have not done this whatsoever so</text>
  <text start="589.41" dur="7.09">this resolution was agreed upon by</text>
  <text start="593.05" dur="5.91">France the US Britain but the US and</text>
  <text start="596.5" dur="4.41">France and the UK now want to erase the</text>
  <text start="598.96" dur="4.23">significant parts of the resolution they</text>
  <text start="600.91" dur="5.76">no longer want a ceasefire but only a</text>
  <text start="603.19" dur="6.18">cessation of hostilities they demand</text>
  <text start="606.67" dur="5.22">under a cessation of all bombing of</text>
  <text start="609.37" dur="5.85">al-nusrah and al-qaeda and its</text>
  <text start="611.89" dur="5.13">associated entities should stop and they</text>
  <text start="615.22" dur="5.1">want to ignore the part in the</text>
  <text start="617.02" dur="5.46">resolution that Syria is a sovereign</text>
  <text start="620.32" dur="5.4">nation they just don&amp;#39;t really care about</text>
  <text start="622.48" dur="5.1">that Kerry was out there saying everyone</text>
  <text start="625.72" dur="3.96">recognizes the complexity of this</text>
  <text start="627.58" dur="4.89">endeavor and there is certainly a lot</text>
  <text start="629.68" dur="4.47">more work to do these discussions have</text>
  <text start="632.47" dur="4.26">been serious and so far constructive</text>
  <text start="634.15" dur="5.49">with a few tough issues still to resolve</text>
  <text start="636.73" dur="5.31">what he&amp;#39;s really saying is we need to</text>
  <text start="639.64" dur="4.65">drag this out as long as possible just</text>
  <text start="642.04" dur="4.92">like the mints to cease fire because</text>
  <text start="644.29" dur="5.16">this is what the US is famous for they</text>
  <text start="646.96" dur="5.91">don&amp;#39;t want anything to be accomplished</text>
  <text start="649.45" dur="7.44">with this so yesterday Russia introduced</text>
  <text start="652.87" dur="6.9">a UNC resolution a new one which was</text>
  <text start="656.89" dur="4.38">going to counteract the Turkish</text>
  <text start="659.77" dur="4.47">artillery fire which is hitting the</text>
  <text start="661.27" dur="6.42">Syrian Kurdish group YPG which is also</text>
  <text start="664.24" dur="5.64">supported by the US so the Russian draft</text>
  <text start="667.69" dur="4.23">would have the council express its grave</text>
  <text start="669.88" dur="4.83">alarm at the reports of military buildup</text>
  <text start="671.92" dur="4.89">and preparatory activities aimed at</text>
