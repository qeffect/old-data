  <text start="120.509" dur="6.03">of is going to hit the front pages none</text>
  <text start="124.05" dur="4.679">of the corporate media but those who are</text>

  <text start="128.729" dur="5.721">FBI special agent Peter struck he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="132.209" dur="4.831">having a very bad June right now and</text>
  <text start="134.45" dur="5.2">after being physically escorted out of</text>
  <text start="137.04" dur="5.19">the FBI office last Friday and losing</text>
  <text start="139.65" dur="4.68">his security clearance this week /</text>
  <text start="142.23" dur="4.32">Attorney General Jeff Sessions Peter</text>

  <text start="146.55" dur="6.329">Judiciary Committee chairman bod Bob</text>
  <text start="149.22" dur="6.299">Goodlatte and struck agreed to testify</text>
  <text start="152.879" dur="5.101">earlier however Grassley issued the</text>
  <text start="155.519" dur="5.131">subpoena to appear on June 27th at 10:00</text>
  <text start="157.98" dur="6.81">a.m. after the FBI agent would not</text>
  <text start="160.65" dur="6.72">commit to a date so what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="164.79" dur="4.529">that struck is now being called in now</text>
  <text start="167.37" dur="3.99">he said he was going to testify didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="169.319" dur="5.041">give a date we know that Comey skipped</text>
  <text start="171.36" dur="4.349">out on certain requests and the whole</text>
  <text start="174.36" dur="2.67">thing is starting to fall apart and I</text>
  <text start="175.709" dur="5.011">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if these people</text>
  <text start="177.03" dur="6.209">start to run or commit suicide because</text>
  <text start="180.72" dur="5.9">they know their days are numbered here</text>
  <text start="183.239" dur="6.53">we see McCain is in trouble</text>
  <text start="186.62" dur="5.07">Q likes to call him no-name and we know</text>
  <text start="189.769" dur="4.11">that McCain is behind a lot of different</text>
  <text start="191.69" dur="4.859">things actually Q was saying that McCain</text>
  <text start="193.879" dur="5.431">is faking his illness and most likely he</text>
  <text start="196.549" dur="5.25">might be on the run or he might go into</text>
  <text start="199.31" dur="4.47">hiding or he might commit suicide who</text>
  <text start="201.799" dur="4.951">knows what he&amp;#39;s going to do but we see</text>
  <text start="203.78" dur="5.16">internal IRS documents obtained by</text>
  <text start="206.75" dur="5.64">Judicial Watch through the Freedom of</text>
  <text start="208.94" dur="5.549">Information Act reveal that in 2013 John</text>
  <text start="212.39" dur="4.92">McCain&amp;#39;s former staff director Henry</text>
  <text start="214.489" dur="7.411">Koerner pushed the Obama IRS to engage</text>
  <text start="217.31" dur="8.13">in financially ruinous audits of 501 C</text>
  <text start="221.9" dur="5.16">organizations 10 days before Obama&amp;#39;s IRS</text>
  <text start="225.44" dur="4.019">publicly admitted to inappropriate</text>
  <text start="227.06" dur="6.989">targeting of groups with tea party or</text>
  <text start="229.459" dur="5.941">patriot in their names and McCain issued</text>
  <text start="234.049" dur="4.08">a statement following the original</text>
  <text start="235.4" dur="4.919">Judicial Watch report on 2013 meeting -</text>
  <text start="238.129" dur="4.23">crying false reports claiming that his</text>
  <text start="240.319" dur="5.611">office was somehow involved in IRS</text>
  <text start="242.359" dur="6.201">targeting of conservative groups and we</text>
  <text start="245.93" dur="7.01">need to look at this very carefully and</text>
  <text start="248.56" dur="8.829">look at this individual kurtter Henry</text>
  <text start="252.94" dur="7.12">John Koerner now years of questions</text>
  <text start="257.389" dur="5.731">about how so many DC scandals never</text>
  <text start="260.06" dur="5.419">ended up with any accountability are now</text>
  <text start="263.12" dur="3.99">slowly beginning to make some sense here</text>
  <text start="265.479" dur="5.201">Henry Koerner</text>
  <text start="267.11" dur="6">is a missing piece of this puzzle so if</text>
  <text start="270.68" dur="5.34">you wanted to control or cover up a DC</text>
  <text start="273.11" dur="4.98">scandal where would you need to be well</text>
  <text start="276.02" dur="2.869">what position what would you need to</text>
  <text start="278.09" dur="3.6">control</text>
  <text start="278.889" dur="4.621">well first you would need to control the</text>
  <text start="281.69" dur="4.979">witnesses and the investigators in</text>
  <text start="283.51" dur="4.45">essence the deep inside the agencies or</text>
  <text start="286.669" dur="4.021">committees doing the investigation</text>
  <text start="287.96" dur="5.79">that&amp;#39;s exactly the functionality where</text>
  <text start="290.69" dur="6.659">John Henry John Koerner comes in henry</text>
  <text start="293.75" dur="6.24">Koerner is special counsel in charge of</text>
  <text start="297.349" dur="4.94">all whistleblowing witnesses in cases of</text>
  <text start="299.99" dur="5.31">government corruption henry Koerner</text>
  <text start="302.289" dur="4.901">controls the events as the lead official</text>
  <text start="305.3" dur="4.649">the special counsel in charge of the</text>
  <text start="307.19" dur="4.849">office of special counsel and he is in</text>
  <text start="309.949" dur="5.731">the position to manipulate control any</text>
  <text start="312.039" dur="6.641">investigative outcome so let&amp;#39;s look at</text>
  <text start="315.68" dur="4.12">Kerner&amp;#39;s DC history when you look at</text>
  <text start="318.68" dur="2.979">this a whole</text>
  <text start="319.8" dur="4.53">bunch of things start to make sense here</text>
  <text start="321.659" dur="5.431">Henry Koerner would have been in a</text>
  <text start="324.33" dur="5.25">position to influence many of the cases</text>
  <text start="327.09" dur="6.63">that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at like fast and</text>
  <text start="329.58" dur="8.19">furious IRS targeting Benghazi Flynn</text>
  <text start="333.72" dur="6.99">Intel leaks and the rest Spygate you</text>
  <text start="337.77" dur="4.41">name it so when we look at this he is</text>
  <text start="340.71" dur="4.049">really the missing piece to all of this</text>
  <text start="342.18" dur="4.29">I mean imagine investigating yourself</text>
  <text start="344.759" dur="4.051">that&amp;#39;s exactly what Koerner was doing as</text>
  <text start="346.47" dur="5.039">a member of the permanent Subcommittee</text>
  <text start="348.81" dur="5.069">on investigations and now Henry Koerner</text>
  <text start="351.509" dur="5.46">is in charge of all investigations of</text>
  <text start="353.879" dur="4.801">fraud and abuse in government and the</text>
  <text start="356.969" dur="4.081">outcomes of whistleblowers</text>
  <text start="358.68" dur="4.62">no wonder the deep state feels empowered</text>
  <text start="361.05" dur="4.5">with DC control agents ensuring the</text>
  <text start="363.3" dur="6.359">corruption and gross misconduct remains</text>
  <text start="365.55" dur="5.97">hidden they&amp;#39;re not really scared of any</text>
  <text start="369.659" dur="3.66">charges being brought up against them or</text>
  <text start="371.52" dur="5.19">getting caught or anything like this</text>
  <text start="373.319" dur="6.361">because Henry Koerner is in charge of</text>
  <text start="376.71" dur="5.82">all this and covering it all up so we</text>
  <text start="379.68" dur="5.91">can see that this is all now being put</text>
  <text start="382.53" dur="6.449">out and we can see where the missing</text>
  <text start="385.59" dur="5.549">piece was and basically moving forward</text>
  <text start="388.979" dur="5.28">we&amp;#39;re gonna find out a whole lot more</text>
  <text start="391.139" dur="6.231">information we see the former prime</text>
  <text start="394.259" dur="5.13">minister of friends jean pierre refer n</text>
  <text start="397.37" dur="4.389">believes that the security and stability</text>
  <text start="399.389" dur="5.611">of the eurasian continent should be</text>
  <text start="401.759" dur="6.21">guaranteed by four countries and these</text>
  <text start="405" dur="7.25">four countries are not the US it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="407.969" dur="8.57">the UK it&amp;#39;s France Germany Russia and</text>
  <text start="412.25" dur="6.61">China because right now Europe is</text>
  <text start="416.539" dur="4.271">experiencing an internal process of</text>
  <text start="418.86" dur="4.95">disintegration following brexit and</text>
  <text start="420.81" dur="5.94">facing increasing instability in the</text>
  <text start="423.81" dur="6.21">outside world and the transatlantic link</text>
  <text start="426.75" dur="8.819">is breaking down and they&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="430.02" dur="7.35">basically rethink their alliances and we</text>
  <text start="435.569" dur="4.141">can we know that this was going to</text>
  <text start="437.37" dur="4.139">happen and we knew that many of the</text>
  <text start="439.71" dur="3.989">European countries have been moving</text>
  <text start="441.509" dur="4.77">closer to Russia moving closer to China</text>
  <text start="443.699" dur="5.19">even though the EU is platings placing</text>
  <text start="446.279" dur="4.98">sanctions on Russia and China individual</text>
  <text start="448.889" dur="3.12">countries are saying you know something</text>
  <text start="451.259" dur="1.86">we</text>
  <text start="452.009" dur="3.86">need to get rid of these sanctions you</text>
  <text start="453.119" dur="5.281">know something China and Russia the</text>
  <text start="455.869" dur="5.711">economic stability joining with them</text>
  <text start="458.4" dur="5.249">with bilateral trades it&amp;#39;s worth it and</text>
  <text start="461.58" dur="6.72">this is what we see happening right now</text>
  <text start="463.649" dur="6.931">out in Afghanistan we see the push to</text>
  <text start="468.3" dur="4.619">destroy the paid mercenary army of the</text>
  <text start="470.58" dur="5.699">deep state is in full force they have</text>
  <text start="472.919" dur="5.191">killed over 160 Islamic state militants</text>
  <text start="476.279" dur="5.1">which is the paid mercenary of the deep</text>
  <text start="478.11" dur="5.039">state and basically what the US and the</text>
  <text start="481.379" dur="4.02">Afghan forces are doing they&amp;#39;re sweeping</text>
  <text start="483.149" dur="5.1">through the country really not fighting</text>
  <text start="485.399" dur="4.74">the Taliban because right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="488.249" dur="4.17">still in negotiations with the Afghan</text>
  <text start="490.139" dur="4.83">government for peace and this is why</text>
  <text start="492.419" dur="4.261">Ghani extended it for one year and now</text>
  <text start="494.969" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re in negotiations talking about</text>
  <text start="496.68" dur="5.489">this at the same time the u.s. Afghan</text>
  <text start="500.009" dur="5.16">forces are going after the paid</text>
  <text start="502.169" dur="6.84">mercenary forces which is the Islamic</text>
  <text start="505.169" dur="6.841">state we see Putin and moon jae-in of</text>
  <text start="509.009" dur="4.681">South Korea they have met and they</text>
  <text start="512.01" dur="3.509">issued a joint statement calling for a</text>
  <text start="513.69" dur="6.149">complete denuclearization of the Korean</text>
  <text start="515.519" dur="6.721">Peninsula and basically we see Trump we</text>
  <text start="519.839" dur="4.471">see Putin we see China North Korea South</text>
  <text start="522.24" dur="4.11">Korea they&amp;#39;re all in agreement for</text>
  <text start="524.31" dur="5.91">denuclearization in the area and</text>
  <text start="526.35" dur="7.38">basically pushing for economic stability</text>
  <text start="530.22" dur="7.32">and we&amp;#39;re going to see things really</text>
  <text start="533.73" dur="8">change in this area North Korea has also</text>
  <text start="537.54" dur="7.979">agreed to erase anti-us propaganda</text>
  <text start="541.73" dur="5.859">within the country and we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="545.519" dur="3.75">protests against the united united</text>
  <text start="547.589" dur="4.591">states they have died down they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="549.269" dur="5.641">getting rid of the propaganda and we see</text>
  <text start="552.18" dur="7.409">that things are definitely changing we</text>
  <text start="554.91" dur="6.69">see out in Syria well Russia Syria they</text>
  <text start="559.589" dur="5.19">have officially entered the southwest</text>
  <text start="561.6" dur="6.03">area of Syria even though the US was</text>
  <text start="564.779" dur="4.651">warning not to do this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="567.63" dur="4.53">attacking different towns and villages</text>
  <text start="569.43" dur="5.55">in this area removing the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="572.16" dur="3.6">and once again they are approaching the</text>
  <text start="574.98" dur="3.93">LTF</text>
  <text start="575.76" dur="5.67">area now what&amp;#39;s very interesting during</text>
  <text start="578.91" dur="6.49">this period weapons have been flowing</text>
  <text start="581.43" dur="6.37">from Jordan into Syria to the paid myrrh</text>
  <text start="585.4" dur="4.86">Ares now this most likely is the deep</text>
  <text start="587.8" dur="4.68">state trying to supply them with any</text>
  <text start="590.26" dur="4.77">weapons they possibly have to try to</text>
  <text start="592.48" dur="5.57">fight this off and it is not working</text>
  <text start="595.03" dur="7.04">right now because in a surprising turn</text>
  <text start="598.05" dur="7.45">the u.s. said hey you know something</text>
  <text start="602.07" dur="5.41">we&amp;#39;re not supporting these paid</text>
  <text start="605.5" dur="4.38">mercenary forces anymore the moderate</text>
  <text start="607.48" dur="4.77">rebels all of them you&amp;#39;re on your own</text>
  <text start="609.88" dur="5.63">now think about what is happening right</text>
  <text start="612.25" dur="8.91">now because it just happened</text>
  <text start="615.51" dur="8.95">where the United States said farewell to</text>
  <text start="621.16" dur="6.42">the moderate rebels to the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="624.46" dur="6.66">to alnus for all the paid mercenary</text>
  <text start="627.58" dur="6.6">forces controlled by the deep state they</text>
  <text start="631.12" dur="6.45">removed their funding they got rid of</text>
  <text start="634.18" dur="5.25">the support by shipping arms there yes</text>
  <text start="637.57" dur="4.92">the deep state still has the ability to</text>
  <text start="639.43" dur="5.7">get arms and bring arms in but coming</text>
  <text start="642.49" dur="5.94">from the United States it has stopped we</text>
  <text start="645.13" dur="6.24">see that the funding for the Kurds has</text>
  <text start="648.43" dur="5.88">stopped all of this has stopped right</text>
  <text start="651.37" dur="7.34">now and everything is in motion and the</text>
  <text start="654.31" dur="7.59">reason for this is because Putin Trump</text>
  <text start="658.71" dur="5.35">Assad they&amp;#39;re all coming together and</text>
  <text start="661.9" dur="5.79">this is why Assad put this message out</text>
  <text start="664.06" dur="7.11">there telling everyone that Washington</text>
  <text start="667.69" dur="6.45">is not going to change if they do change</text>
  <text start="671.17" dur="4.89">then he&amp;#39;ll think about meeting with the</text>
  <text start="674.14" dur="4.23">president but he&amp;#39;s saying if you really</text>
  <text start="676.06" dur="6.78">listen to his message it&amp;#39;s a waste of</text>
  <text start="678.37" dur="7.02">time if the US stays on the track</text>
  <text start="682.84" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;ve been on since the invasion of</text>
  <text start="685.39" dur="6.57">Syria and that is going about back about</text>
  <text start="688.48" dur="6.09">seven eight years now this is a message</text>
  <text start="691.96" dur="4.56">to get and they&amp;#39;re projecting this to</text>
  <text start="694.57" dur="5.16">let everyone know that these talks are</text>
  <text start="696.52" dur="3.6">going to happen getting everyone used to</text>
  <text start="699.73" dur="2.76">this</text>
  <text start="700.12" dur="5.22">Assad already put it out there that if</text>
  <text start="702.49" dur="5.01">Washington does change he might consider</text>
  <text start="705.34" dur="3.33">talking to the president now the</text>
  <text start="707.5" dur="4.05">president is going to stay very very</text>
  <text start="708.67" dur="5.52">quiet on this because their mission is</text>

  <text start="766.74" dur="4.56">just like when we had the gas attack so</text>
  <text start="769.65" dur="3.63">the deep state they&amp;#39;re trying whatever</text>
