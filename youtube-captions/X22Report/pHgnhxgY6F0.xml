  <text start="383.409" dur="6.54">now people are saying listen the reason</text>
  <text start="387.189" dur="6.78">why I&amp;#39;m purchasing a weapon is to</text>

  <text start="448.029" dur="3.93">was going to happen in April 2016</text>

  <text start="495.579" dur="6.6">to the contact line and we most likely</text>
  <text start="498.759" dur="7.61">will see some type of false flag event</text>
  <text start="502.179" dur="7.32">or something to create the illusion that</text>
  <text start="506.369" dur="5.41">Kiev needs to attack the southeastern</text>

  <text start="545.05" dur="4.259">what&amp;#39;s really interesting about this is</text>

  <text start="739.48" dur="5.4">should come together to fight terrorism</text>
  <text start="741.82" dur="6.18">now China is on board with this saying</text>
  <text start="744.88" dur="6.3">this is a fantastic idea to create a</text>
  <text start="748" dur="8.58">United anti-terrorism front acting under</text>
  <text start="751.18" dur="8.219">the UN control and they&amp;#39;re saying to the</text>
  <text start="756.58" dur="7.28">international community we all must work</text>
  <text start="759.399" dur="6.661">together we must track the flow of funds</text>
  <text start="763.86" dur="4.51">find out how they&amp;#39;re getting their</text>
  <text start="766.06" dur="4.56">weapons and then we&amp;#39;ll that will lead us</text>
  <text start="768.37" dur="5.43">back to those countries that are</text>
  <text start="770.62" dur="7.26">supporting terrorism now we know Israel</text>
  <text start="773.8" dur="5.72">the United States the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="777.88" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re not gonna let this happen</text>
  <text start="779.52" dur="6.4">they don&amp;#39;t want this being tracked back</text>
  <text start="782.17" dur="5.88">to them and they&amp;#39;re not going to most</text>
  <text start="785.92" dur="6.12">likely agree with this whatsoever maybe</text>
  <text start="788.05" dur="8.67">out in the public forum but nothing on</text>
  <text start="792.04" dur="7.83">paper now we understand we just had this</text>
  <text start="796.72" dur="4.619">false flag in San Bernardino where we</text>
  <text start="799.87" dur="2.969">had this mass shooting now of course we</text>
  <text start="801.339" dur="3">had the gun control and it looks like</text>
  <text start="802.839" dur="3.061">they&amp;#39;re leading towards terrorism right</text>
  <text start="804.339" dur="4.351">now and they&amp;#39;re pushing that meme right</text>
  <text start="805.9" dur="5.22">now where yes they&amp;#39;re part of the</text>
  <text start="808.69" dur="4.769">Islamic state yes the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="811.12" dur="3.93">bad and a lot of it&amp;#39;s not making sense</text>
  <text start="813.459" dur="4.831">but what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this</text>
  <text start="815.05" dur="8.039">is that US Rep Matt Salman and 10 francs</text>
  <text start="818.29" dur="7.46">are now adding pressure to update the</text>
  <text start="823.089" dur="6.261">United States war authorization to</text>
  <text start="825.75" dur="5.32">basically fight the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="829.35" dur="5.38">directly</text>
  <text start="831.07" dur="6.09">and Senator Jeff Flake has been pushing</text>
  <text start="834.73" dur="6">for a war bill and it looks like that</text>
  <text start="837.16" dur="5.85">authorization for war now is back in the</text>
  <text start="840.73" dur="4.49">spotlight and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="843.01" dur="5.06">gonna get ready to push this forward and</text>
  <text start="845.22" dur="7.54">we know this is what these events are</text>
  <text start="848.07" dur="8.26">used for they&amp;#39;re used to take bills that</text>
  <text start="852.76" dur="5.93">are dying in Congress light a fire under</text>
  <text start="856.33" dur="6.36">them get people to look at them and</text>
  <text start="858.69" dur="5.74">hopefully it gains traction and what</text>
  <text start="862.69" dur="4.14">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a lot of</text>
  <text start="864.43" dur="4.98">warnings coming out they&amp;#39;re saying from</text>
  <text start="866.83" dur="6.2">the US Embassy in Nigeria there is a</text>
  <text start="869.41" dur="5.82">terrorism a possible terrorism attack</text>
  <text start="873.03" dur="5.32">waiting in the wings they&amp;#39;re warning all</text>
  <text start="875.23" dur="7.53">US citizens to be careful in that area</text>
  <text start="878.35" dur="6.54">and this whole San Bernardino shooting</text>
  <text start="882.76" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re really building up it but a lot</text>
  <text start="884.89" dur="9.08">of it is not making sense whatsoever</text>
  <text start="887.11" dur="12.48">I mean Farook and his wife both passed</text>
  <text start="893.97" dur="8.29">the DHS terrorism screening nothing in</text>
  <text start="899.59" dur="4.8">their backgrounds so right now we know</text>
  <text start="902.26" dur="4.26">all this screening is if you go in with</text>
  <text start="904.39" dur="3.81">the official story is a waste of time if</text>
  <text start="906.52" dur="3.9">you&amp;#39;re believing that this person was</text>
  <text start="908.2" dur="5.04">really a terrorism but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="910.42" dur="7.8">interesting about this is that this</text>
  <text start="913.24" dur="9.03">entire story is not making sense now his</text>
  <text start="918.22" dur="7.68">wife came in on a k1 fiancee visa last</text>
  <text start="922.27" dur="5.58">year and co-workers recalled Farook</text>
  <text start="925.9" dur="4.5">telling them that he met his wife online</text>
  <text start="927.85" dur="5.16">he was making a trip to Saudi Arabia and</text>
  <text start="930.4" dur="4.23">he was gonna marry her he spent nine</text>
  <text start="933.01" dur="4.8">days in Saudi Arabia in the summer of</text>
  <text start="934.63" dur="5.79">2014 according to the Saudi embassy in</text>
  <text start="937.81" dur="7.05">Washington Farook returned to the u.s.</text>
  <text start="940.42" dur="8.64">in July of 2014 he brought his wife his</text>
  <text start="944.86" dur="6.72">fiancee back with him they did the</text>
  <text start="949.06" dur="3.09">screening nothing unusual about it</text>
  <text start="951.58" dur="3.15">whatsoever</text>
  <text start="952.15" dur="5.28">I went through the FBI Department of</text>
  <text start="954.73" dur="5.04">Homeland Security absolutely nothing and</text>
  <text start="957.43" dur="3.72">in order to obtain the green card the</text>
  <text start="959.77" dur="3.87">couple had to prove that their marriage</text>
  <text start="961.15" dur="3.63">was legitimate and you know they had to</text>
  <text start="963.64" dur="3.21">provide free no prints</text>
  <text start="964.78" dur="5.1">and pass all the screening tests which</text>
  <text start="966.85" dur="4.83">they did so this is why it really</text>
  <text start="969.88" dur="5.7">doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense because they were</text>
  <text start="971.68" dur="6.84">two people he was a citizen worked for</text>
  <text start="975.58" dur="5.22">the state had a child they were</text>
  <text start="978.52" dur="8.28">attending a holiday party at a</text>
  <text start="980.8" dur="7.5">disability Center and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="986.8" dur="5.22">saying he just left came back with</text>
  <text start="988.3" dur="6.33">fatigues mass amount of weapons and pipe</text>
  <text start="992.02" dur="7.2">bombs and he just decided to shoot</text>
  <text start="994.63" dur="7.89">everyone up again no motive and what</text>
  <text start="999.22" dur="6.48">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is just with all</text>
  <text start="1002.52" dur="5.97">of these type of false flag events which</text>
  <text start="1005.7" dur="4.77">is different than a hoax Sandy Hook was</text>
  <text start="1008.49" dur="5.55">a false flags / hoax</text>
  <text start="1010.47" dur="7.59">because they were using actors the</text>
  <text start="1014.04" dur="6.18">school was closed no one died we know</text>
  <text start="1018.06" dur="5.4">this from the FBI report when they</text>
  <text start="1020.22" dur="4.86">issued the number of deaths and they</text>
  <text start="1023.46" dur="2.94">forgot to it that well actually there</text>
  <text start="1025.08" dur="6">was nothing to include at that point</text>
  <text start="1026.4" dur="7.44">this right here most likely is a false</text>
  <text start="1031.08" dur="6.27">flag where they come in and they will</text>
  <text start="1033.84" dur="7.68">kill people if they have to to prove</text>
  <text start="1037.35" dur="8.43">their point 9/11 buildings came down</text>
  <text start="1041.52" dur="7.44">people jumped they died people died in</text>
  <text start="1045.78" dur="5.46">the buildings so they&amp;#39;re getting to the</text>
  <text start="1048.96" dur="4.98">point where it&amp;#39;s time for them to start</text>
  <text start="1051.24" dur="6.78">killing people to get what they need to</text>
  <text start="1053.94" dur="6.42">get which doesn&amp;#39;t mean that this just</text>
  <text start="1058.02" dur="4.74">happened out of the thin blue you know</text>
  <text start="1060.36" dur="4.8">at a thin air it happened because they</text>
  <text start="1062.76" dur="4.86">planned this event and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1065.16" dur="6.87">learning right now is Farook he was in</text>
  <text start="1067.62" dur="8.54">contact with the FBI and we know this</text>
  <text start="1072.03" dur="9.06">from other dealings that yes</text>
  <text start="1076.16" dur="8.68">FBI speaks to these people FBI uses</text>
  <text start="1081.09" dur="5.73">these people and for all we know he</text>
  <text start="1084.84" dur="3.87">might have thought that he was part of</text>
  <text start="1086.82" dur="4.35">this drill because when they found him</text>
  <text start="1088.71" dur="6.08">in this SUV which when you look at it</text>
  <text start="1091.17" dur="7.86">where do you go to rent that SUV</text>
  <text start="1094.79" dur="7.09">secondly he was wearing shorts what</text>
  <text start="1099.03" dur="6.72">you know special tactical gear is that</text>
  <text start="1101.88" dur="6.62">makes no sense and when we looked at him</text>
  <text start="1105.75" dur="5.73">where were the weapons he was handcuffed</text>
  <text start="1108.5" dur="6.04">the whole entire picture of it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1111.48" dur="4.32">make sense their attorney says there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1114.54" dur="3.54">lot of disconnects a lot of things</text>
  <text start="1115.8" dur="4.14">Quitely don&amp;#39;t make sense and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1118.08" dur="5.22">add up and this is coming from attorney</text>
  <text start="1119.94" dur="4.68">David s celli he says witnesses and</text>
  <text start="1123.3" dur="2.73">investigators have both described a</text>
  <text start="1124.62" dur="3.75">terrace on site carried out with</text>
  <text start="1126.03" dur="4.95">military precision by suspects who were</text>
  <text start="1128.37" dur="5.61">trained and capable he goes the problem</text>
  <text start="1130.98" dur="6.39">is Farook and his wife they didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1133.98" dur="5.91">the necessary skill set to pull this off</text>
  <text start="1137.37" dur="4.439">and don&amp;#39;t forget what happened to the</text>
  <text start="1139.89" dur="2.88">third person you notice how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1141.809" dur="6.031">forgetting about that</text>
  <text start="1142.77" dur="8.07">it&amp;#39;s just disappearing so we can see at</text>
  <text start="1147.84" dur="4.02">this point this whole story is starting</text>
  <text start="1150.84" dur="3.54">to fall apart</text>
  <text start="1151.86" dur="7.88">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting today is</text>
  <text start="1154.38" dur="8.01">that they allowed reporters into the</text>
  <text start="1159.74" dur="7.42">couple&amp;#39;s apartment they&amp;#39;re saying the</text>
  <text start="1162.39" dur="8.07">landlord ripped off the boarded up door</text>
  <text start="1167.16" dur="4.56">and allowed the reporters inside now</text>
  <text start="1170.46" dur="3.57">other reports are saying that the</text>
  <text start="1171.72" dur="5.22">reporters forced their ways in but the</text>
  <text start="1174.03" dur="5.7">question is this is a crime scene</text>
  <text start="1176.94" dur="5.19">I mean we have the ATF we have the FBI</text>
  <text start="1179.73" dur="8.19">we have the local police doing an</text>
  <text start="1182.13" dur="7.83">investigation where was the police tape</text>
  <text start="1187.92" dur="4.29">on the doors where was the police saying</text>
  <text start="1189.96" dur="4.65">no one can enter this because think</text>
  <text start="1192.21" dur="5.01">about it in a police investigation what</text>
  <text start="1194.61" dur="6.75">happens if they have to go back into the</text>
  <text start="1197.22" dur="5.64">apartment to look for evidence you know</text>
  <text start="1201.36" dur="3.51">they might be missing something</text>
  <text start="1202.86" dur="5.93">now the reporters are in there touching</text>
  <text start="1204.87" dur="7.89">everything taking things moving things</text>
  <text start="1208.79" dur="5.2">planting things and we know things were</text>
  <text start="1212.76" dur="4.32">already planted in there but I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="1213.99" dur="7.59">saying this looks like a completely</text>
  <text start="1217.08" dur="6.87">staged photo op this is what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1221.58" dur="4.86">right now and the reason for this is</text>
  <text start="1223.95" dur="5.969">because the story is falling apart and</text>
  <text start="1226.44" dur="5.729">they need to continually show you that</text>
  <text start="1229.919" dur="4.98">these were terrorists and of course we</text>
  <text start="1232.169" dur="5.401">one picture of a reporter looking at</text>
  <text start="1234.899" dur="5.27">their passports it always goes back to</text>
  <text start="1237.57" dur="5.489">the passports which is amazing so</text>
  <text start="1240.169" dur="7.151">they&amp;#39;re creating a giant media spectacle</text>
  <text start="1243.059" dur="5.97">trying to prove their point and this</text>
  <text start="1247.32" dur="5.489">whole story is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="1249.029" dur="7.71">now German intelligence is warning that</text>
  <text start="1252.809" dur="5.641">Saudi Arabia has the stabilizing role in</text>
  <text start="1256.739" dur="4.8">the Middle East now it looks like these</text>
  <text start="1258.45" dur="5.459">people were from Saudi Arabia they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1261.539" dur="4.11">bringing up Saudi Arabia and it looks</text>
  <text start="1263.909" dur="3.301">like they might be using Saudi Arabia as</text>
  <text start="1265.649" dur="3.301">the scapegoat for what&amp;#39;s been happening</text>
  <text start="1267.21" dur="3.089">in the Middle East at this point now we</text>
  <text start="1268.95" dur="4.109">know Saudi Arabia doesn&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="1270.299" dur="4.291">with United without the United States we</text>
  <text start="1273.059" dur="3.511">know that Saudi Arabia takes their</text>
  <text start="1274.59" dur="4.11">orders from the United States but it</text>
  <text start="1276.57" dur="4.02">looks like they might be you know out</text>
  <text start="1278.7" dur="3.51">there and hanging out to dry at this</text>
  <text start="1280.59" dur="4.409">point and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to watch that</text>
  <text start="1282.21" dur="6.779">very very carefully now the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1284.999" dur="5.49">state came out and they said France was</text>
  <text start="1288.989" dur="3.091">the beginning tomorrow will be</text>
  <text start="1290.489" dur="4.591">Washington it will be New York</text>
  <text start="1292.08" dur="5.849">it&amp;#39;ll be Moscow and they did this in a</text>
  <text start="1295.08" dur="7.409">video of course they didn&amp;#39;t mention San</text>
  <text start="1297.929" dur="7.44">Bernardino very interesting and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1302.489" dur="4.471">saying that whatever is coming is going</text>
  <text start="1305.369" dur="3.93">to be much much worse</text>
  <text start="1306.96" dur="4.679">now what I&amp;#39;m thinking at this point is</text>
  <text start="1309.299" dur="5.85">that this story isn&amp;#39;t gaining traction</text>
  <text start="1311.639" dur="6.15">with the San Bernardino shooting they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1315.149" dur="4.11">trying to pin it on terrorism the gun</text>
  <text start="1317.789" dur="3">control thing completely fell apart</text>
  <text start="1319.259" dur="4.11">because if there&amp;#39;s truly terrorists and</text>
  <text start="1320.789" dur="4.71">you believe their story their narrative</text>
  <text start="1323.369" dur="3.721">of the story you would want to be armed</text>
  <text start="1325.499" dur="3.51">because terrorists are coming to the</text>
  <text start="1327.09" dur="3.12">United States and I think this whole</text>
  <text start="1329.009" dur="1.561">thing is starting to fall apart right</text>
  <text start="1330.21" dur="2.819">now</text>
  <text start="1330.57" dur="4.14">and what I think they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="1333.029" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re preparing for the next false</text>
  <text start="1334.71" dur="8.13">flag to reinforce what we&amp;#39;ve seen and</text>
  <text start="1338.789" dur="6.151">most likely it will probably be a an act</text>
  <text start="1342.84" dur="4.019">of terrorism because we know the</text>
  <text start="1344.94" dur="4.319">authorization for war is pending in</text>
  <text start="1346.859" dur="3.991">Congress they want to push that they</text>
  <text start="1349.259" dur="5.461">want the war to start they want more</text>
  <text start="1350.85" dur="7.59">troops in this area and I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="1354.72" dur="6.87">this last false flag is doing what they</text>
  <text start="1358.44" dur="5.01">really wanted listen everyone thanks a</text>
  <text start="1361.59" dur="5.689">lot for listening be well be safe and</text>
