  <text start="248.34" dur="4.869">322 to 308 votes</text>
  <text start="250.72" dur="4.079">prior to the vote main lawmakers had</text>
  <text start="253.209" dur="5.041">expressed frustration that three days</text>
  <text start="254.799" dur="5.671">was not enough time to understand the</text>
  <text start="258.25" dur="6.21">bill which runs more than a hundred</text>
  <text start="260.47" dur="7.71">pages Boris Johnson had pushed for the</text>
  <text start="264.46" dur="8.459">timetable because he wanted to leave the</text>
  <text start="268.18" dur="7.2">EU by the October 31st date it is also</text>
  <text start="272.919" dur="4.341">concerned that a longer period of review</text>
  <text start="275.38" dur="5.49">will result in the bill being heavily</text>
  <text start="277.26" dur="5.159">amended now if they failed to get a deal</text>
  <text start="280.87" dur="4.53">through before October 31st</text>
  <text start="282.419" dur="4.691">Boris Johnson might go ahead with a No</text>

  <text start="287.11" dur="5.13">letter</text>
  <text start="287.47" dur="7.89">to the EU and then the EU has zero</text>
