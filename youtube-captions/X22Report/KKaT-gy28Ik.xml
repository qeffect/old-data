  <text start="220.52" dur="4.95">mean unbelievable but what I found</text>
  <text start="223.31" dur="10.32">interesting is statistics that they use</text>
  <text start="225.47" dur="9.93">are from 2006 and 1979 I mean here I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="233.63" dur="3">just not gonna read it all but you know</text>

  <text start="256.76" dur="5.97">children and teens I&amp;#39;m sorry children&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="259.34" dur="5.52">and teens so and it goes on and on and</text>
  <text start="262.73" dur="5.76">on and I&amp;#39;m like why are they using dates</text>
  <text start="264.86" dur="5.529">like you know seven years ago so such a</text>
  <text start="268.49" dur="4.94">long time ago I mean</text>
  <text start="270.389" dur="4.541">but basically the whole thing is I asked</text>
  <text start="273.43" dur="4.26">my children you know what was it like</text>
  <text start="274.93" dur="5.209">what did they show you they said they</text>

  <text start="280.139" dur="7.331">1911 of a child shooting another child</text>
  <text start="284.949" dur="6.241">and you know they said it was very scary</text>
  <text start="287.47" dur="6.54">and you know they heard this kid</text>
  <text start="291.19" dur="6.84">screaming but what&amp;#39;s funny about this is</text>

  <text start="298.03" dur="8.82">911 call coming in where a child called</text>
  <text start="303.039" dur="8.041">up and said I took my parents gun and I</text>
  <text start="306.85" dur="5.76">shot an intruder and save myself because</text>
  <text start="311.08" dur="4.08">there&amp;#39;s a lot of those because every</text>
  <text start="312.61" dur="5.76">story that they can produce there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="315.16" dur="4.95">another story that counters whatever</text>
  <text start="318.37" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re saying and the other thing I i</text>
  <text start="320.11" dur="3.869">found interesting they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="321.46" dur="5.07">gangs because they had to include the</text>
  <text start="323.979" dur="6.841">gangs with this whole thing they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="326.53" dur="7.259">talk about knives bats anything like</text>
  <text start="330.82" dur="5.43">that they only talked about guns so the</text>
  <text start="333.789" dur="6.481">real agenda was guns and how to</text>
  <text start="336.25" dur="6.539">brainwash the children on how guns are</text>
  <text start="340.27" dur="6.149">scary and guns are no good and you can</text>
  <text start="342.789" dur="7.801">see what they&amp;#39;re trying to do here but</text>
  <text start="346.419" dur="8.43">that&amp;#39;s on a side note and let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="350.59" dur="6.09">the economic collapse news and what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="354.849" dur="4.231">going to do is I&amp;#39;ll scan this in and</text>
  <text start="356.68" dur="4.53">I&amp;#39;ll put this up on the site so you can</text>
  <text start="359.08" dur="4.23">see and i&amp;#39;ll also put it in the people</text>
  <text start="361.21" dur="4.26">so if you wanted to see it you can take</text>
  <text start="363.31" dur="5.419">a look and comment on it i haven&amp;#39;t done</text>
  <text start="365.47" dur="3.259">it yet i&amp;#39;ll do it after this broadcast</text>
  <text start="369.12" dur="6.91">the the feds seize another Bitcoin site</text>
  <text start="372.789" dur="10.741">and basically what I&amp;#39;m getting from all</text>
  <text start="376.03" dur="11.22">this is that the government do not want</text>
  <text start="383.53" dur="7.259">any other type of currency out there</text>
  <text start="387.25" dur="6.27">right now besides the dollar and if</text>
  <text start="390.789" dur="4.711">anything else pops up they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="393.52" dur="6.69">take it and they&amp;#39;re going to close it</text>
  <text start="395.5" dur="6.57">down and that&amp;#39;s that and gold and silver</text>
  <text start="400.21" dur="4.13">a little bit harder so what do they do</text>
  <text start="402.07" dur="5.369">so people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="404.34" dur="5.47">by gold and silver or that you know they</text>
  <text start="407.439" dur="4.681">try to make them feel like it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="409.81" dur="5.909">good investment or it&amp;#39;s not money they</text>
  <text start="412.12" dur="5.759">smack the price down as far down as they</text>
  <text start="415.719" dur="6.69">can do it and they try to get all the</text>
  <text start="417.879" dur="6.951">people who owned it out of it but I</text>
  <text start="422.409" dur="4.681">think it&amp;#39;s having an an opposite effect</text>
  <text start="424.83" dur="4.919">where when the price keeps going down</text>
  <text start="427.09" dur="5.129">more and more people continue to buy it</text>
  <text start="429.749" dur="6.431">the physical I&amp;#39;m talking about not the</text>
  <text start="432.219" dur="7.281">paper now there was a article that says</text>
  <text start="436.18" dur="3.32">the Bank for International Settlements</text>
  <text start="441.36" dur="5.829">reported that a collapse of the eurozone</text>
  <text start="444.58" dur="6.299">interbank loans and warns of a stock</text>
  <text start="447.189" dur="8.13">market crash so we&amp;#39;re getting all of</text>
  <text start="450.879" dur="6.66">these type of warnings and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="455.319" dur="4.41">letting us know that something is coming</text>
  <text start="457.539" dur="4.59">and the article goes on to say there is</text>
  <text start="459.729" dur="4.201">no economic recovery however the loose</text>
  <text start="462.129" dur="4.201">monetary policies of central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="463.93" dur="4.799">drives the share prices to record highs</text>
  <text start="466.33" dur="5.13">therefore the biz warns of bubble</text>
  <text start="468.729" dur="4.771">information the markets were under the</text>
  <text start="471.46" dur="3.87">curse of the world&amp;#39;s central banks the</text>
  <text start="473.5" dur="4.169">Bank for International Settlements the</text>
  <text start="475.33" dur="4.41">cheap money pushing up stocks stock</text>
  <text start="477.669" dur="4.161">prices at record highs even though there</text>
  <text start="479.74" dur="6.479">was absolutely no economic recovery and</text>
  <text start="481.83" dur="7.78">again we all notice the Fed the central</text>
  <text start="486.219" dur="5.611">banks are pushing these markets up most</text>
  <text start="489.61" dur="5.459">of the people are not in the markets</text>
  <text start="491.83" dur="6.899">it&amp;#39;s really the the banks that are</text>
  <text start="495.069" dur="6.06">receiving the money from the Fed and</text>
  <text start="498.729" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re investing their money into the</text>
  <text start="501.129" dur="4.47">market but the Fed wants everybody in</text>
  <text start="503.379" dur="4.41">and that&amp;#39;s why you see articles around</text>
  <text start="505.599" dur="4.49">the mainstream media where Bernanke is</text>
  <text start="507.789" dur="5.011">daring people to get into the market and</text>
  <text start="510.089" dur="7.57">we see this popping up on many of the</text>
  <text start="512.8" dur="8.039">mainstream media sites like MarketWatch</text>
  <text start="517.659" dur="4.68">there was one in New York Times and I</text>
  <text start="520.839" dur="5.151">think it&amp;#39;s the same story that they just</text>
  <text start="522.339" dur="6.451">keep reprinting all over the place now</text>
  <text start="525.99" dur="6.789">it looks like Detroit is going to</text>
  <text start="528.79" dur="5.97">declare bankruptcy and this is how you</text>
  <text start="532.779" dur="4.661">can tell that everything&amp;#39;s in a recovery</text>
  <text start="534.76" dur="5.5">when Detroit</text>
  <text start="537.44" dur="5.49">is is going bankrupt it&amp;#39;s the auto</text>
  <text start="540.26" dur="7.08">industry capital of the United States</text>
  <text start="542.93" dur="7.22">and basically it can&amp;#39;t make it so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="547.34" dur="6">how you know that their recovery is is</text>
  <text start="550.15" dur="5.23">going the way they wanted to go now the</text>
  <text start="553.34" dur="5.58">there was an article also that said the</text>
  <text start="555.38" dur="6.21">second housing bubble pop mass layoffs</text>
  <text start="558.92" dur="6.12">for mortgage bankers and it went out to</text>
  <text start="561.59" dur="6.63">say that the housing bubble may have</text>
  <text start="565.04" dur="5.4">already popped the following cop comment</text>
  <text start="568.22" dur="4.02">from mark hansen should pour cold water</text>
  <text start="570.44" dur="3.81">on anyone who&amp;#39;s still harbors any</text>
  <text start="572.24" dur="5.04">illusion that there is a housing</text>
  <text start="574.25" dur="5.28">recovery or that any transitory cheap</text>
  <text start="577.28" dur="4.76">credit driven price hikes will persist</text>
  <text start="579.53" dur="7.14">now what they&amp;#39;re saying is that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="582.04" dur="7.45">mass layoffs coming to mortgage</text>
  <text start="586.67" dur="5.52">companies a large-scale sudden mortgage</text>
  <text start="589.49" dur="6.03">finance job loss on deck will impact</text>
  <text start="592.19" dur="8.79">weekly claims so basically what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="595.52" dur="7.65">saying that here it says this morning I</text>
  <text start="600.98" dur="9.03">was made aware that three large private</text>
  <text start="603.17" dur="8.82">mortgage bankers are bankers I followed</text>
  <text start="610.01" dur="5.34">closely for trends in mortgage finance</text>
  <text start="611.99" dur="6.9">all had mass layoffs last friday and</text>
  <text start="615.35" dur="8.57">yesterday to the tune of twenty-five to</text>
  <text start="618.89" dur="5.03">fifty percent of their operations staff</text>
  <text start="623.95" dur="8.38">so this obvious me this obviously means</text>
  <text start="628.76" dur="6.18">that reports of refi apps being down</text>
  <text start="632.33" dur="4.92">sixty five to ninety percent in the past</text>
  <text start="634.94" dur="5.88">three weeks are far more accurate than</text>
  <text start="637.25" dur="6.27">the lagging NBA index which is likely on</text>
  <text start="640.82" dur="7.32">its way to print multi-year lows in the</text>
  <text start="643.52" dur="7.08">next month so again I saw today in the</text>
  <text start="648.14" dur="4.83">New York Times they&amp;#39;re telling everyone</text>
  <text start="650.6" dur="4.8">you know that the market is great</text>
  <text start="652.97" dur="4.89">everyone should get in we&amp;#39;re hearing</text>
  <text start="655.4" dur="8.97">this from other people but this is a</text>
  <text start="657.86" dur="9.57">false housing boom it&amp;#39;s it was it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="664.37" dur="6">propped up by hedge funds by other</text>
  <text start="667.43" dur="3.52">investors by the fed by the banks</text>
  <text start="670.37" dur="3.49">holding</text>
  <text start="670.95" dur="6.03">back before closed properties by the Fed</text>
  <text start="673.86" dur="6.21">buying up all the toxic loans at 45</text>
  <text start="676.98" dur="6.33">billion dollars a month so we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="680.07" dur="5.76">completely fake and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="683.31" dur="8.24">see the cracks and things shine through</text>
  <text start="685.83" dur="10.2">and basically we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of this</text>
  <text start="691.55" dur="11.05">happening very quickly where we see more</text>
  <text start="696.03" dur="9.09">and more reports of of the market like</text>
  <text start="702.6" dur="5.85">the Japanese market the bond market the</text>
  <text start="705.12" dur="5.85">Nikkei going up and down making you know</text>
  <text start="708.45" dur="4.58">going down 500 points going back up 200</text>
  <text start="710.97" dur="4.32">points going down another 700 points</text>
  <text start="713.03" dur="6.39">they had a lot of halts on the bond</text>
  <text start="715.29" dur="7.44">market in Japan and what I&amp;#39;m thinking is</text>
  <text start="719.42" dur="6.58">the way we&amp;#39;re going to probably see this</text>
  <text start="722.73" dur="7.11">is the Japanese market when it does</text>
  <text start="726" dur="6.24">collapse people will take their money</text>
  <text start="729.84" dur="4.14">and put it into the euro and then you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="732.24" dur="4.5">see the Euro rise because they think</text>
  <text start="733.98" dur="5.46">that will be safe and I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="736.74" dur="4.92">people will will put it into gold and</text>
  <text start="739.44" dur="4.95">silver yet because I think the Fed will</text>
  <text start="741.66" dur="4.68">continually push that down so no one</text>
  <text start="744.39" dur="4.98">does that because then when the ripple</text>
  <text start="746.34" dur="4.71">effect comes across into Europe people</text>
  <text start="749.37" dur="4.26">will then take their money from Europe</text>
  <text start="751.05" dur="4.62">in the euro and put it into the dollar</text>
  <text start="753.63" dur="4.32">and then you&amp;#39;ll see the dollar rise and</text>
  <text start="755.67" dur="5.66">they&amp;#39;ll continually suppress the gold</text>

  <text start="763.65" dur="5.04">put their money into the dollar and what</text>
  <text start="766.83" dur="4.41">will happen then as the ripple effect</text>

  <text start="771.24" dur="7.62">America those people in the dollar will</text>
  <text start="775.47" dur="6.18">start to look for another place to put</text>

  <text start="781.65" dur="5.67">to see the stock market teetering and</text>
  <text start="784.65" dur="6.96">fault and and starting to collapse</text>

  <text start="801.33" dur="3.12">start putting their money into that and</text>
  <text start="803.01" dur="4.47">this I think this is what everyone</text>
  <text start="804.45" dur="6.21">talking about when they say that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="807.48" dur="4.38">going to see a huge increase in gold and</text>
  <text start="810.66" dur="4.2">silver because that will be the only</text>
  <text start="811.86" dur="5.64">safe place and as people leave the</text>

  <text start="817.5" dur="4.14">put it all into gold you&amp;#39;ll see the</text>

  <text start="823.98" dur="5.64">final collapse of everything and I was</text>
  <text start="827.79" dur="4.5">just thinking about this and playing</text>
  <text start="829.62" dur="4.08">this out in my head and you know if</text>
  <text start="832.29" dur="3.45">anyone likes that would like to comment</text>
  <text start="833.7" dur="6.99">go ahead and comment on what i said and</text>
  <text start="835.74" dur="7.46">if you have a different theory but I at</text>
  <text start="840.69" dur="7.37">this point this is the way I see it</text>
  <text start="843.2" dur="8.13">coming down okay let&amp;#39;s move on here now</text>
  <text start="848.06" dur="6.54">we know the collapse is getting close</text>
  <text start="851.33" dur="6.54">because the you know the Japanese market</text>
  <text start="854.6" dur="5.95">the high unemployment in Europe</text>
  <text start="857.87" dur="10.18">protesters in Spain and Portugal turkey</text>
  <text start="860.55" dur="9.69">is having huge riots there and this I</text>
  <text start="868.05" dur="4.8">don&amp;#39;t believe I believe the people are</text>
  <text start="870.24" dur="6.98">actually rising up and this is how</text>
  <text start="872.85" dur="7.83">quickly it happens and it is really</text>
  <text start="877.22" dur="6.46">moving fast and I believe they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="880.68" dur="5.31">to try to overthrow and get rid of the</text>
  <text start="883.68" dur="5.94">prime missed prime minister out of</text>
  <text start="885.99" dur="5.88">Turkey but another way you can tell that</text>
  <text start="889.62" dur="7.86">things are really speeding up right now</text>
  <text start="891.87" dur="8.37">is I mean first of all Russia has</text>
  <text start="897.48" dur="4.83">station advanced missiles in Armenia and</text>
  <text start="900.24" dur="9.35">if you look at the position of where</text>
  <text start="902.31" dur="10.47">Armenia is it is very close to Syria and</text>
  <text start="909.59" dur="6.28">basically what this says is that Russian</text>
  <text start="912.78" dur="4.83">has deployed in armenia state-of-the-art</text>
  <text start="915.87" dur="4.86">ballistic missiles capable of striking</text>
  <text start="917.61" dur="5.16">targets more than 400 kilometers away so</text>
  <text start="920.73" dur="3.81">if you look at the map just go to google</text>
  <text start="922.77" dur="3.42">go to maps and type in Armenia you can</text>
  <text start="924.54" dur="3.99">see where then zoom out a little bit you</text>
  <text start="926.19" dur="7.11">can see where that is and you can see</text>
  <text start="928.53" dur="7.38">where Syria is and if I look at the</text>
  <text start="933.3" dur="4.79">little scale here you know we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="935.91" dur="2.18">at</text>
  <text start="938.23" dur="7.96">basically they&amp;#39;re right in the area of</text>
  <text start="942.98" dur="7.13">the ability to fire these missiles right</text>
  <text start="946.19" dur="11.009">into Syria if something happens there</text>
  <text start="950.11" dur="11.219">and now the United States is having</text>
  <text start="957.199" dur="6.541">drills on the Jordan Syria border and</text>
  <text start="961.329" dur="4.721">they&amp;#39;re just going to leave the Patriot</text>
  <text start="963.74" dur="4.74">missile batteries after the drills are</text>
  <text start="966.05" dur="5.849">done and again if you go to Google Maps</text>
  <text start="968.48" dur="6.859">and you look where Jordan is it is right</text>
  <text start="971.899" dur="7.831">next to Syria so they are positioning</text>
  <text start="975.339" dur="6.701">everything for this war this is no</text>
  <text start="979.73" dur="4.2">longer Oh willerby one won&amp;#39;t there be</text>
  <text start="982.04" dur="3.9">one I mean I always thought there is</text>
  <text start="983.93" dur="3.48">totally going to be one because they</text>
  <text start="985.94" dur="4.319">need to cover up the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="987.41" dur="8.4">they are positioning everything and</text>
  <text start="990.259" dur="8.69">getting prepared for the war and you</text>
  <text start="995.81" dur="5.16">know they&amp;#39;re even going a step further</text>
  <text start="998.949" dur="5.01">there was an article that says Obama</text>
  <text start="1000.97" dur="12.08">welcomes China to steal military secrets</text>
  <text start="1003.959" dur="15.401">and basically Obama is is is having</text>

  <text start="1791.9" dur="7.11">happening here in America is it to me</text>
  <text start="1795.8" dur="7.23">and I you let me know if you don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="1799.01" dur="7.23">this but it looks like going back they</text>
  <text start="1803.03" dur="6.18">want they have moved all manufacturing</text>
  <text start="1806.24" dur="7.1">out of the states they have removed all</text>
  <text start="1809.21" dur="9.47">the jobs out of the states they are now</text>
  <text start="1813.34" dur="10.36">with this exposure to the GMO wheat</text>
  <text start="1818.68" dur="6.67">crops we are now having less exports of</text>
  <text start="1823.7" dur="4.95">food out of this country&amp;#39;s of this</text>
  <text start="1825.35" dur="8.96">country America is now a shell of</text>
  <text start="1828.65" dur="11.57">nothing there is nothing here anymore</text>
  <text start="1834.31" dur="10.42">except natural resources that are</text>
  <text start="1840.22" dur="8.17">protected in our national parks and the</text>
  <text start="1844.73" dur="5.13">reason why these national parks were not</text>
  <text start="1848.39" dur="4.38">allowed to be touched because they were</text>
  <text start="1849.86" dur="8.28">promised to other countries as</text>
  <text start="1852.77" dur="9.33">collateral for our debt that is really</text>
  <text start="1858.14" dur="5.25">why these were implemented not because</text>
  <text start="1862.1" dur="4.79">they wanted to keep it safe for the</text>
  <text start="1863.39" dur="5.07">American people these specific areas are</text>
  <text start="1866.89" dur="3.94">rich in</text>
  <text start="1868.46" dur="6.2">resources and they have already been</text>
  <text start="1870.83" dur="10.2">promised to other countries or people as</text>
  <text start="1874.66" dur="9.99">collateral so basically they have</text>
  <text start="1881.03" dur="11.16">completely cleaned out and wiped out</text>
  <text start="1884.65" dur="12.42">America there is nothing left here so I</text>
  <text start="1892.19" dur="11.52">mean we are looking at a total complete</text>
  <text start="1897.07" dur="8.98">meltdown of the economy here and for</text>
  <text start="1903.71" dur="7.68">those who don&amp;#39;t see it really need to</text>
  <text start="1906.05" dur="8.31">wake up and it is coming sooner than you</text>
  <text start="1911.39" dur="6">think and what I did was I went back to</text>
  <text start="1914.36" dur="6.63">my episode with the Great Depression I</text>
  <text start="1917.39" dur="7.44">just wanted to read to you again I put</text>
  <text start="1920.99" dur="6.63">it on the x 22 report com on this page</text>
  <text start="1924.83" dur="4.38">if you click on the title of this report</text>
  <text start="1927.62" dur="4.29">it will bring you to the full page and</text>
  <text start="1929.21" dur="5.52">at the bottom I made the chart of the</text>
  <text start="1931.91" dur="4.8">Great Depression of 1929 compared to</text>
  <text start="1934.73" dur="6">what&amp;#39;s going on now with the economic</text>
  <text start="1936.71" dur="7.76">collapse and it is startling how they</text>
  <text start="1940.73" dur="5.79">were repeating exactly i mean exactly</text>
  <text start="1944.47" dur="5.82">what they did in the Great Depression</text>
  <text start="1946.52" dur="7.35">with only a couple of minor differences</text>
  <text start="1950.29" dur="5.23">we have a derivative market back then</text>
  <text start="1953.87" dur="5.1">they didn&amp;#39;t but they had option calls</text>
  <text start="1955.52" dur="5.31">back then so they there was something</text>
  <text start="1958.97" dur="4.29">new there called options today we have</text>
  <text start="1960.83" dur="5.55">derivatives derivatives are in what is</text>
  <text start="1963.26" dur="9">it 1,000 times worse than that and the</text>
  <text start="1966.38" dur="8.25">other thing that Bernanke said he that</text>
  <text start="1972.26" dur="4.8">when he studied the Great Depression the</text>
  <text start="1974.63" dur="4.14">thing that that didn&amp;#39;t work was because</text>
  <text start="1977.06" dur="4.68">they didn&amp;#39;t print money they contracted</text>
  <text start="1978.77" dur="5.67">the money but I believe what he was</text>
  <text start="1981.74" dur="4.2">saying is if they only printed money we</text>
  <text start="1984.44" dur="3.72">could have kept it going on a little bit</text>
  <text start="1985.94" dur="5.64">longer and gotten a lot more wealth</text>
  <text start="1988.16" dur="6.68">that&amp;#39;s how I read it so basically what</text>
  <text start="1991.58" dur="6.48">he did was for the next from 2008 till</text>
  <text start="1994.84" dur="7">now look how much more wealth will be</text>
  <text start="1998.06" dur="5.76">able to steal if we do it this way that</text>
  <text start="2001.84" dur="5.189">what they learned but let&amp;#39;s look at this</text>
  <text start="2003.82" dur="5.609">and you know for those listeners who&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="2197.559" dur="9.05">if we use the calculation before it was</text>
  <text start="2202.21" dur="7.05">changed in 2008 the unemployment is</text>
  <text start="2206.609" dur="5.531">twenty-three percent but if we just use</text>

  <text start="2233.77" dur="8.13">propping up this economy longer than it</text>
  <text start="2238.24" dur="6.93">should have been so let&amp;#39;s see what else</text>
  <text start="2241.9" dur="6.179">happened in 1929 Federal Reserve has cut</text>
  <text start="2245.17" dur="6.81">the prime interest rate from six to four</text>
