  <text start="222.61" dur="7.2">come together it&amp;#39;s the end for them now</text>
  <text start="226.66" dur="5.55">something very interesting it looks like</text>
  <text start="229.81" dur="5.31">there was a lawsuit filed against the</text>
  <text start="232.21" dur="7.74">FBI and Justice Department and this is</text>
  <text start="235.12" dur="6.78">by Peter struck and he&amp;#39;s arguing that</text>
  <text start="239.95" dur="4.56">his firing was politically motivated and</text>
  <text start="241.9" dur="5.73">in violation of two constitutional</text>
  <text start="244.51" dur="5.91">amendments and they argue that he was</text>
  <text start="247.63" dur="4.59">fired for using his protected political</text>
  <text start="250.42" dur="4.47">speech under the First Amendment and the</text>
  <text start="252.22" dur="4.47">FBI also deprived him of his due process</text>
  <text start="254.89" dur="5.31">under Fifth Amendment by denying him the</text>
  <text start="256.69" dur="6.54">right to appeal the decision so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="260.2" dur="5.01">bringing this lawsuit up and they are</text>
  <text start="263.23" dur="4.44">now suing the Department of Justice and</text>
  <text start="265.21" dur="5.99">the FBI and this is coming out of the</text>
  <text start="267.67" dur="6.17">conservative tree house this is a</text>
  <text start="271.2" dur="6.13">political stunt one hundred percent</text>
  <text start="273.84" dur="8.11">think about why Peter struck all of a</text>
  <text start="277.33" dur="8.309">sudden decided to sue well let&amp;#39;s look at</text>
  <text start="281.95" dur="9.41">his lawyers this is</text>
  <text start="285.639" dur="8.821">Golemon Spader Zukerman salesman and</text>
  <text start="291.36" dur="7.179">Julia T Quinn from Heller her on</text>
  <text start="294.46" dur="6.299">chirkoff and salesman and it would seem</text>
  <text start="298.539" dur="5.13">that Peter struck has been advised by</text>
  <text start="300.759" dur="5.611">his law fair allies to get ahead of any</text>
  <text start="303.669" dur="5.041">potential legal risk associated with his</text>
  <text start="306.37" dur="5.46">involvement in the Trump campaign 2016</text>
  <text start="308.71" dur="6.169">spying and surveillance operation by</text>
  <text start="311.83" dur="5.28">filing a legal action purposely to claim</text>
  <text start="314.879" dur="5.44">retaliation in advance of any</text>
  <text start="317.11" dur="6.329">consequences from the IG report on FISA</text>
  <text start="320.319" dur="6.57">abuse this lawsuit is frivolous on its</text>
  <text start="323.439" dur="5.7">face however it can be purposely as a</text>
  <text start="326.889" dur="4.53">political to to frame a narrative</text>
  <text start="329.139" dur="4.291">against action by the Department of</text>
  <text start="331.419" dur="5.25">Justice in Petra inspector general or</text>
  <text start="333.43" dur="4.789">any criminal referrals therein this was</text>
  <text start="336.669" dur="5.31">done on purpose</text>
  <text start="338.219" dur="7.391">because he understands what is coming</text>
  <text start="341.979" dur="6.631">and by filing this suit he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="345.61" dur="5.669">protect himself saying oh they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="348.61" dur="5.16">after me because I filed this suit oh</text>
  <text start="351.279" dur="6.471">they&amp;#39;re bringing this up because I filed</text>
  <text start="353.77" dur="7.97">this suit this is why he did this</text>
  <text start="357.75" dur="8.83">because they know what&amp;#39;s about to drop</text>
  <text start="361.74" dur="8.139">they know that all this information is</text>
  <text start="366.58" dur="5.429">going to be coming out now it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="369.879" dur="4.891">interesting that structures filed this</text>
  <text start="372.009" dur="6.541">lawsuit because Judicial Watch obtained</text>
  <text start="374.77" dur="5.899">records of 14 referrals of FBI employees</text>
  <text start="378.55" dur="3.769">for leaking sensitive or classified</text>
  <text start="380.669" dur="4.27">information</text>
  <text start="382.319" dur="4.87">now they receive this information and</text>
  <text start="384.939" dur="4.141">the record show that penalties for</text>
  <text start="387.189" dur="4.111">unauthorized disclosure of sensitive</text>
  <text start="389.08" dur="5.04">and/or classified information ranged</text>
  <text start="391.3" dur="5.339">from no action due to administrative</text>
  <text start="394.12" dur="5.699">closure - as in the case of McCabe</text>
  <text start="396.639" dur="4.95">dismissal other FBI employees offenses</text>
  <text start="399.819" dur="4.171">reported in the documents list several</text>
  <text start="401.589" dur="6.241">cases in which the final action was less</text>
  <text start="403.99" dur="6.169">severe than OPRS proposal and let me</text>
  <text start="407.83" dur="5.13">just read through a couple of these an</text>
  <text start="410.159" dur="5.861">unidentified employee was fired the case</text>
  <text start="412.96" dur="4.499">was closed in July 2016 an unidentified</text>
  <text start="416.02" dur="2.85">employee was given a one-day suspension</text>
  <text start="417.459" dur="4.171">without pay</text>
  <text start="418.87" dur="5.34">the case was closed in April 2016 the</text>
  <text start="421.63" dur="4.17">following year an unidentified employee</text>
  <text start="424.21" dur="3.42">received a five-day suspension without</text>
  <text start="425.8" dur="5.3">pay and the case was closed</text>

  <text start="433.479" dur="4.44">was closed in May 2018 an unidentified</text>

  <text start="440.56" dur="4.38">case was closed in October 2017 and it</text>
  <text start="443.02" dur="4.38">goes on and on and on like this where</text>
  <text start="444.94" dur="6.17">most of them nothing really happened and</text>
  <text start="447.4" dur="6.09">this was leaking classified information</text>
  <text start="451.11" dur="4.779">tom Fitton said the following</text>
  <text start="453.49" dur="4.77">no wonder the FBI was leaking so</text>
  <text start="455.889" dur="4.861">profusely collectively these documents</text>
  <text start="458.26" dur="5.1">show leaning treeman for evident</text>
  <text start="460.75" dur="3.81">criminal activity only three of the 14</text>
  <text start="463.36" dur="3.18">employees found to have made an</text>
  <text start="464.56" dur="8.37">unauthorized disclosure were dismissed</text>
  <text start="466.54" dur="8.31">from the FBI and you can see why no one</text>
  <text start="472.93" dur="3.959">had a problem with leaking information</text>
  <text start="474.85" dur="5.31">because they knew nothing was going to</text>
  <text start="476.889" dur="4.731">come out of it now this is very</text>
  <text start="480.16" dur="4.59">interesting</text>
  <text start="481.62" dur="5.47">Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has</text>
  <text start="484.75" dur="4.8">ordered a state criminal probe into the</text>
  <text start="487.09" dur="4.35">actions of the Palm Beach sheriff and</text>

  <text start="496.57" dur="6.15">Santis decided to do this was because of</text>
  <text start="499.33" dur="5.61">the Palm Beach chef Ric Bradshaw and he</text>
  <text start="502.72" dur="4.77">has come under increasing scrutiny for</text>

  <text start="516.94" dur="6.18">accused of molesting dozens of underage</text>
  <text start="518.589" dur="8.611">girls and while he had this lenient work</text>
  <text start="523.12" dur="7.38">privilege or release privilege it seems</text>
  <text start="527.2" dur="5.579">like he had sex with underage girls</text>
  <text start="530.5" dur="5.22">during this period of time so now</text>
