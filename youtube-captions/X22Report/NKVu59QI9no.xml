  <text start="203.919" dur="6.69">this is the central bank this is their</text>
  <text start="207.04" dur="6.119">system we&amp;#39;ve been taught over the many</text>
  <text start="210.609" dur="6.21">many years to think that this is normal</text>
  <text start="213.159" dur="7.621">this is not normal this is their system</text>
  <text start="216.819" dur="6.931">and they created it to control all the</text>
  <text start="220.78" dur="5.25">countries to create what we see today</text>
  <text start="223.75" dur="4.5">where we have corruption where we have</text>
  <text start="226.03" dur="5.609">the deep state where they wanted a</text>
  <text start="228.25" dur="5.639">one-world one currency government this</text>
  <text start="231.639" dur="5.49">is what they&amp;#39;ve been striving for now</text>
  <text start="233.889" dur="4.981">today it is completely falling apart and</text>
  <text start="237.129" dur="3.33">they understand this and we&amp;#39;re seeing it</text>
  <text start="238.87" dur="3.839">all over the place I mean look at Italy</text>
  <text start="240.459" dur="6.691">look at Australia look at the UK look at</text>

  <text start="249.4" dur="7.47">is panicking right now the central bank</text>
  <text start="253.269" dur="6.12">system the establishment they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="256.87" dur="5.84">at the situation and saying okay we are</text>
  <text start="259.389" dur="6.361">veered off from what we wanted to do and</text>
  <text start="262.71" dur="6.19">you can see it everywhere you can see</text>
  <text start="265.75" dur="6.3">how the central bank system cannot</text>
  <text start="268.9" dur="5.759">operate under these conditions because</text>
  <text start="272.05" dur="6.54">it was never meant to it was never meant</text>
  <text start="274.659" dur="6.781">to go this far and soon what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="278.59" dur="7.62">happen is they will be completely</text>
  <text start="281.44" dur="7.08">exposed to everything right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="286.21" dur="5.179">hiding behind tariffs they&amp;#39;re hiding</text>
  <text start="288.52" dur="7.29">behind trade they&amp;#39;re hiding behind</text>
  <text start="291.389" dur="5.62">countries soon this will all disappear</text>
  <text start="295.81" dur="3.93">and</text>
  <text start="297.009" dur="5.821">they will be standing front and center</text>
  <text start="299.74" dur="6">but in the meantime the entire economic</text>
  <text start="302.83" dur="5.039">system is falling apart Ford they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="305.74" dur="5.19">going to be cutting 12,000 jobs in</text>
  <text start="307.869" dur="4.94">Europe by the end of 2020 now think</text>
  <text start="310.93" dur="6.12">about it they put all these regulations</text>
  <text start="312.809" dur="5.95">forth about build low emission cars you</text>
  <text start="317.05" dur="3.329">know we need to go green we need to do</text>
  <text start="318.759" dur="5.041">this and a lot of it&amp;#39;s still impossible</text>
  <text start="320.379" dur="6.47">to do it&amp;#39;s not cost-effective but they</text>
  <text start="323.8" dur="6.389">put all of these regulations forward and</text>
  <text start="326.849" dur="6.4">it&amp;#39;s hurting the automobile industry and</text>
  <text start="330.189" dur="6.331">they need to reduce their staff because</text>
  <text start="333.249" dur="5.461">they&amp;#39;re not profitable anymore all these</text>
  <text start="336.52" dur="5.069">corporations they&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="338.71" dur="5.609">profitable in a failing central bank</text>
  <text start="341.589" dur="5.76">system the only thing that&amp;#39;s making it</text>
  <text start="344.319" dur="7.41">look like they are profitable is the</text>
  <text start="347.349" dur="7.07">illusion that the central bank has made</text>
  <text start="351.729" dur="5.73">the economy look great what do they do</text>
  <text start="354.419" dur="4.631">they brought rates almost down to zero</text>
  <text start="357.459" dur="4.95">actually in Europe it&amp;#39;s a negative</text>
  <text start="359.05" dur="7.38">territory and they created stimulus if</text>
  <text start="362.409" dur="6.6">you take that away if you take all of</text>
  <text start="366.43" dur="4.379">that away and just let the economy do</text>
  <text start="369.009" dur="5.19">what it was supposed to do everything</text>
  <text start="370.809" dur="5.19">would have failed now Trump he</text>
  <text start="374.199" dur="5.49">understands as the Patriots they</text>
  <text start="375.999" dur="6.48">understand this they realize that if</text>
  <text start="379.689" dur="4.71">they don&amp;#39;t cut the rates if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="382.479" dur="5.22">start stimulus the whole thing starts to</text>
  <text start="384.399" dur="5.76">fall apart now since the rates have been</text>
  <text start="387.699" dur="5.161">locked down and there they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="390.159" dur="5.16">allowed to rise anymore we see that</text>
  <text start="392.86" dur="5.76">pending home sales right now they have</text>
  <text start="395.319" dur="5.791">risen to 1.1 percent in May indicating</text>
  <text start="398.62" dur="5.279">Americans may be responding to declining</text>
  <text start="401.11" dur="6.389">mortgage rates now think about this when</text>
  <text start="403.899" dur="6.63">the Fed cuts their rates by the middle</text>
  <text start="407.499" dur="4.26">to end this summer home sales they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="410.529" dur="3">gonna start to move up because the</text>
  <text start="411.759" dur="3.601">mortgage rates are going to drop it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="413.529" dur="4.74">going to bring more and more people into</text>
  <text start="415.36" dur="4.47">the market same thing with everything</text>
  <text start="418.269" dur="3.93">else and it&amp;#39;s going to help corporations</text>
  <text start="419.83" dur="5.79">stay profitably because most of them</text>
  <text start="422.199" dur="4.741">would fail right now now Trump is in</text>
  <text start="425.62" dur="3.57">Japan</text>
  <text start="426.94" dur="5.04">and he&amp;#39;s meeting with many leaders</text>
  <text start="429.19" dur="5.28">talking trade tariffs busy creating the</text>
  <text start="431.98" dur="4.89">new economy for the people and Trump</text>
  <text start="434.47" dur="3.75">tweeted out the following I look forward</text>
  <text start="436.87" dur="3.27">to speaking with Prime Minister Modi</text>
  <text start="438.22" dur="4.05">about the fact that India for years</text>
  <text start="440.14" dur="2.82">having put very high tariffs against the</text>
  <text start="442.27" dur="2.94">United States</text>
  <text start="442.96" dur="5.13">just recently increased the tariffs even</text>
  <text start="445.21" dur="5.97">further this is unacceptable and the</text>
  <text start="448.09" dur="6.66">tariffs must be withdrawn now you have</text>
  <text start="451.18" dur="6.15">to remember Trump is out in the g20 out</text>
  <text start="454.75" dur="5.24">in Japan I should say at the g20 and</text>
  <text start="457.33" dur="5.67">he&amp;#39;s speaking with all of these leaders</text>
  <text start="459.99" dur="6.25">letting them know that he&amp;#39;s about to</text>
  <text start="463" dur="6.57">even the playing field on trade and</text>
  <text start="466.24" dur="6.54">again most likely he&amp;#39;ll be making some</text>
  <text start="469.57" dur="6.78">type of deal with Xi Jinping everything</text>
  <text start="472.78" dur="5.19">has been set for this actually moon</text>

  <text start="477.97" dur="4.53">little bit in the next report he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="479.89" dur="6.15">already saying that North Korea and</text>
  <text start="482.5" dur="7.1">South Korea and China and the US were</text>
  <text start="486.04" dur="7.17">primed to have denuclearization and</text>
  <text start="489.6" dur="4.03">remember Trump is going to visit moon</text>
  <text start="493.21" dur="3.87">jaein</text>
  <text start="493.63" dur="6.96">in South Korea after the g20 everything</text>
  <text start="497.08" dur="8.31">has been set so this deal between China</text>
  <text start="500.59" dur="7.86">and Trump goes through which means once</text>
  <text start="505.39" dur="6.92">again the central bank is going to be</text>
  <text start="508.45" dur="7.529">completely exposed now as time goes on</text>
  <text start="512.31" dur="7.03">Trump&amp;#39;s messages will become clearer and</text>
  <text start="515.979" dur="5.37">clearer in regards to the Fed what he</text>
  <text start="519.34" dur="4.35">wants to do with the economy and how</text>
