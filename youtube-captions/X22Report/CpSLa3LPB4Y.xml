  <text start="56.92" dur="5.4">need to report my name is Dave and this</text>
  <text start="58.6" dur="6.269">is episode 1559 be end today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="62.32" dur="5.579">May 3rd 2018 and the top of the episode</text>
  <text start="64.869" dur="6.631">is Apple Plains and the mysterious</text>
  <text start="67.899" dur="6.11">shipment let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="71.5" dur="4.799">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="74.009" dur="7">now it&amp;#39;s starting to look really really</text>
  <text start="76.299" dur="7.771">bad for Trump and there are individuals</text>
  <text start="81.009" dur="6.831">calling for impeachment and it looks</text>
  <text start="84.07" dur="8.359">like the deep state is weakening him and</text>
  <text start="87.84" dur="7.479">weakening him Giuliani was out there and</text>
  <text start="92.429" dur="6.911">basically he made this announcement that</text>
  <text start="95.319" dur="5.401">Trump reimbursed Cohen for the hundred</text>
  <text start="99.34" dur="5.55">thirty thousand that Cohen paid to</text>
  <text start="100.72" dur="5.73">stormy Daniels and Trump is saying that</text>
  <text start="104.89" dur="3.42">he didn&amp;#39;t know what this was for he</text>
  <text start="106.45" dur="4.349">didn&amp;#39;t know the specifics for it he</text>
  <text start="108.31" dur="4.589">didn&amp;#39;t know the specifics of the deal he</text>
  <text start="110.799" dur="4.291">knew it was a general arrangement and</text>
  <text start="112.899" dur="6.271">that Cohen would take care of things</text>
  <text start="115.09" dur="5.97">like that and Giuliani is out there</text>
  <text start="119.17" dur="4.769">saying that this money was not campaign</text>
  <text start="121.06" dur="6.54">money he goes I&amp;#39;m giving you a fact that</text>
  <text start="123.939" dur="7.02">this is not campaign money no campaign</text>
  <text start="127.6" dur="5.46">finance violations whatsoever he said</text>
  <text start="130.959" dur="5.791">the money was funneled through the law</text>
  <text start="133.06" dur="5.25">firm and the president repaid it so this</text>
  <text start="136.75" dur="3.329">is very interesting now of course the</text>
  <text start="138.31" dur="4.62">corporate media is going wild over this</text>
  <text start="140.079" dur="5.701">I think stormy Daniels she&amp;#39;s speechless</text>
  <text start="142.93" dur="5.94">because she probably is like I&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="145.78" dur="5.1">thought this was going to happen and we</text>
  <text start="148.87" dur="6.3">can see that things are actually</text>
  <text start="150.88" dur="7.32">changing where it looks like CNN is</text>
  <text start="155.17" dur="6.96">going off on this and the president</text>
  <text start="158.2" dur="8.369">looks weakened or is this part of the</text>
  <text start="162.13" dur="7.5">plan well let&amp;#39;s go into what the</text>
  <text start="166.569" dur="5.581">corporate media is doing right now the</text>
  <text start="169.63" dur="4.02">corporate media is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="172.15" dur="3.6">making a very big deal about this</text>
  <text start="173.65" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re also reporting that Michael</text>
  <text start="175.75" dur="3.63">Cohen&amp;#39;s phones and email accounts are</text>
  <text start="177.31" dur="4.17">being wiretapped and under surveillance</text>
  <text start="179.38" dur="3.85">by the special counsel Robert Mueller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="181.48" dur="4">investigation</text>
  <text start="183.23" dur="5.64">and they gained all this information by</text>
  <text start="185.48" dur="7.41">wiretapping him and this is really not a</text>
  <text start="188.87" dur="5.88">surprise that this is happening but the</text>
  <text start="192.89" dur="3.06">one thing that we need to understand</text>
  <text start="194.75" dur="4.22">about all of this</text>
  <text start="195.95" dur="4.86">is that when the Special Counsel was</text>
  <text start="198.97" dur="5.17">authorizing this and this is Rod</text>
  <text start="200.81" dur="5.069">Rosenstein when he authorized all of</text>
  <text start="204.14" dur="5.599">this the investigation of the Special</text>
  <text start="205.879" dur="6.511">Counsel there was a transfer of</text>
  <text start="209.739" dur="5.291">investigative authority from the FBI to</text>
  <text start="212.39" dur="5.81">Robert Mueller now this is the</text>
  <text start="215.03" dur="5.58">underpinning of the insurance policy as</text>
  <text start="218.2" dur="4.81">originally begun via the original FISA</text>
  <text start="220.61" dur="6.78">surveillance warrant granted in October</text>
  <text start="223.01" dur="7.71">of 2016 the only thing that changed was</text>
  <text start="227.39" dur="5.33">who was conducting the investigation the</text>
  <text start="230.72" dur="6.03">appointment of the Special Counsel</text>
  <text start="232.72" dur="5.859">Council merely transferred the ongoing</text>
  <text start="236.75" dur="4.67">investigation from inside the FBI</text>
  <text start="238.579" dur="6.99">counterintelligence unit which was page</text>
  <text start="241.42" dur="8.98">stroszek or and the rest to Robert</text>
  <text start="245.569" dur="7.801">Mueller too Ariens lb Andrew Weissman</text>
  <text start="250.4" dur="6.059">the ongoing Special Counsel</text>
  <text start="253.37" dur="7.25">investigation is identical in every way</text>
  <text start="256.459" dur="6.511">that the FBI was handling the FISA</text>
  <text start="260.62" dur="3.669">surveillance I mean the only thing that</text>
  <text start="262.97" dur="3.75">changed was the name and the</text>
  <text start="264.289" dur="5.761">participants the current Mueller</text>
  <text start="266.72" dur="6.6">investigation is the same one initiated</text>
  <text start="270.05" dur="5.79">by the FBI in 2016 that is what is</text>
  <text start="273.32" dur="5.88">hidden in the redactions of the</text>
  <text start="275.84" dur="6.09">instructions by rod Rosenstein so when</text>
  <text start="279.2" dur="5.25">you look at the information the letter</text>
  <text start="281.93" dur="4.44">from Rob Rosenstein you&amp;#39;ll see the black</text>
  <text start="284.45" dur="4.2">areas those that are redacted areas and</text>
  <text start="286.37" dur="7.26">basically this is what they are actually</text>
  <text start="288.65" dur="6.75">hiding now in today&amp;#39;s report of the</text>
  <text start="293.63" dur="4.62">wiretapping of michael cohen</text>
  <text start="295.4" dur="5.1">is nothing more than a discovery of the</text>
  <text start="298.25" dur="5.43">existence of the ongoing insurance</text>
  <text start="300.5" dur="5.22">policy started in 2016 as an operation</text>
  <text start="303.68" dur="5.73">to conduct political surveillance of a</text>
  <text start="305.72" dur="4.979">campaign continuing in 2018 as an</text>
  <text start="309.41" dur="3.99">operation to conduct political</text>
  <text start="310.699" dur="5.371">surveillance of an administration now</text>
  <text start="313.4" dur="3.42">remember they were doing this as an</text>
  <text start="316.07" dur="4.68">insurance</text>
  <text start="316.82" dur="5.91">policy so before Trump became president</text>
  <text start="320.75" dur="5.1">and after Trump became president they</text>
  <text start="322.73" dur="4.77">were finding a way to get rid of him so</text>
  <text start="325.85" dur="3.45">the original 2016 FBI</text>
  <text start="327.5" dur="4.5">counterintelligence operation against</text>
  <text start="329.3" dur="4.83">Trump never ended it still goes on today</text>
  <text start="332" dur="6.33">the only thing that changed was the</text>
  <text start="334.13" dur="5.82">entities conducting the investigation so</text>
  <text start="338.33" dur="4.74">it looks like right now</text>
  <text start="339.95" dur="6.03">they have been spying on him ever since</text>
  <text start="343.07" dur="5.31">and they haven&amp;#39;t stopped they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="345.98" dur="4.14">to catch him in something where they can</text>
  <text start="348.38" dur="7.68">get rid of him and have him impeached</text>
  <text start="350.12" dur="7.86">and this brings us to post 1287 now we</text>
  <text start="356.06" dur="5.73">need to go back a little bit because</text>

  <text start="444.98" dur="9.17">couple weeks ago in this post 1287</text>
  <text start="449.85" dur="8.35">he said who has the power if POTUS was</text>
  <text start="454.15" dur="9.019">in a weakened position about to be</text>
  <text start="458.2" dur="7.29">impeached or indicted would they resign</text>
  <text start="463.169" dur="7.75">why are we here</text>
  <text start="465.49" dur="9.929">public forum world watching sharing of</text>
  <text start="470.919" dur="9.061">Intel to bad actors to me this seems</text>
  <text start="475.419" dur="8.481">like this was a set up to make everyone</text>
  <text start="479.98" dur="9.14">believe Trump is in a weakened position</text>
  <text start="483.9" dur="8.17">and to make their move</text>
  <text start="489.12" dur="6.07">making them think that he is in a</text>
  <text start="492.07" dur="5.55">weakened position and I think this is</text>
  <text start="495.19" dur="5.039">this whole thing was a complete set up</text>
  <text start="497.62" dur="5.58">because Q already told us that this was</text>
  <text start="500.229" dur="7.651">going to be a setup and it looks like it</text>
  <text start="503.2" dur="5.25">actually is now we can see out in North</text>
  <text start="507.88" dur="4.38">Korea</text>
  <text start="508.45" dur="6.57">kim jeong-hoon met with the Chinese</text>
  <text start="512.26" dur="5.73">foreign minister and it looks like they</text>
  <text start="515.02" dur="5.76">came to an agreement that there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="517.99" dur="4.41">to be denuclearization in North Korea</text>
  <text start="520.78" dur="5.37">and it looks like this is holding right</text>
  <text start="522.4" dur="6.48">now and it looks like everything is</text>
  <text start="526.15" dur="7.53">going according to plan now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="528.88" dur="9.75">interesting there was a UK signed secret</text>
  <text start="533.68" dur="7.8">deal with the Saudi military where they</text>
  <text start="538.63" dur="5.55">were supplying them with weapons to use</text>
  <text start="541.48" dur="5.64">against Yemen and these new documents</text>
  <text start="544.18" dur="5.55">came out and so Saudi Arabia has</text>
  <text start="547.12" dur="6.3">remained by far Britain&amp;#39;s leading arms</text>
  <text start="549.73" dur="5.49">export customers half of all UK exports</text>
  <text start="553.42" dur="5.43">of weapons and military equipment from</text>
  <text start="555.22" dur="5.88">2013 to 2017 went to the kingdom now</text>
  <text start="558.85" dur="7.65">most of the equipment went to the Royal</text>
  <text start="561.1" dur="7.56">Saudi Air Force 151 of whose 324 combat</text>
  <text start="566.5" dur="4.47">aircraft are British supplied along with</text>
  <text start="568.66" dur="4.47">weapons ground systems parts and spares</text>
  <text start="570.97" dur="4.32">and things like that now the UK</text>
  <text start="573.13" dur="3.75">government insists that it isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="575.29" dur="5.13">responsible for and cannot even</text>
  <text start="576.88" dur="6.39">necessarily know how UK supplied weapons</text>
  <text start="580.42" dur="7.26">are used after they are been shipped</text>
  <text start="583.27" dur="7.11">and last July the High Court agreed that</text>
  <text start="587.68" dur="5.13">yeah it makes no difference now under a</text>
  <text start="590.38" dur="5.19">sequence of formal agreements between</text>
  <text start="592.81" dur="6.33">the UK and the Saudi government in since</text>
  <text start="595.57" dur="5.43">1973 the UK Ministry of Defense and its</text>

  <text start="619.39" dur="5.55">aircraft and other military equipment</text>
  <text start="621.13" dur="5.64">and the ministers have assured</text>
  <text start="624.94" dur="4.98">Parliament that these support staff are</text>
  <text start="626.77" dur="4.89">strictly hands-off saying that there is</text>

  <text start="726.4" dur="8.76">they are helping with the war in Yemen</text>
  <text start="731.05" dur="6.03">and again we can see the u.s. is part of</text>
  <text start="735.16" dur="4.53">the UK as part of this</text>
  <text start="737.08" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s the coalition forces the deep state</text>
  <text start="739.69" dur="5.07">that is part of all of this we see out</text>
  <text start="742.12" dur="4.71">in Syria the Syrian Arab army seized a</text>
  <text start="744.76" dur="4.41">large quantity of weapons from the</text>
  <text start="746.83" dur="4.98">rebels and basically when they look</text>
  <text start="749.17" dur="5.07">through them they found out that a lot</text>
  <text start="751.81" dur="5.37">of these weapons were manufactured in</text>
  <text start="754.24" dur="6.03">Israel they were assault rifles mortar</text>
  <text start="757.18" dur="5.16">shells ammunition there&amp;#39;s a whole bunch</text>
  <text start="760.27" dur="5.28">of it and it looks like it&amp;#39;s coming from</text>
  <text start="762.34" dur="5.37">Israel we see right now that the Syrian</text>
  <text start="765.55" dur="4.11">Arab army managed to split the Islamic</text>

  <text start="792.85" dur="5.28">part of Damascus they&amp;#39;re getting on</text>
  <text start="794.74" dur="5.67">buses and they&amp;#39;re allowed safe passage</text>
  <text start="798.13" dur="4.86">out of the entire area so we can see</text>
  <text start="800.41" dur="5.73">right now Syria and the Syrian forces</text>
  <text start="802.99" dur="5.79">have been taking control of all these</text>
  <text start="806.14" dur="5.28">areas right now and the rebels the</text>

  <text start="811.42" dur="5.43">terrorist groups they&amp;#39;re all giving up</text>
  <text start="813.34" dur="6.63">and basically they are being evacuated</text>
  <text start="816.85" dur="6.57">and there are a loud free passage out of</text>
  <text start="819.97" dur="7.98">the country we see the OPCW they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="823.42" dur="8.37">going to exhume bodies of the duma</text>
  <text start="827.95" dur="5.13">attack so basically the white helmets</text>
  <text start="831.79" dur="3">they&amp;#39;re saying that these are the people</text>
  <text start="833.08" dur="5.43">that died they already buried them and</text>
  <text start="834.79" dur="5.97">now the OPCW they&amp;#39;re gonna go in they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="838.51" dur="5.55">gonna dig up the bodies they want to run</text>
  <text start="840.76" dur="6.42">autopsies tests on these bodies now the</text>
  <text start="844.06" dur="5.67">question is how smart where that white</text>
  <text start="847.18" dur="3.65">helmets how smart whether deep State how</text>
  <text start="849.73" dur="3.02">smart or</text>
  <text start="850.83" dur="5.13">all these individuals involved in this</text>
  <text start="852.75" dur="5.37">staged event did they plant the bodies</text>
  <text start="855.96" dur="4.89">with the chemicals in them or did they</text>
  <text start="858.12" dur="4.11">just bury bodies and say these are the</text>
  <text start="860.85" dur="4.5">bodies that were hit with chemical</text>
  <text start="862.23" dur="7.32">attacks because if there is no evidence</text>
  <text start="865.35" dur="6.42">that they died from sarin or chlorine or</text>
  <text start="869.55" dur="5.52">anything else guess what</text>
  <text start="871.77" dur="4.47">game over and I believe that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="875.07" dur="2.48">we&amp;#39;re going to see because I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="876.24" dur="5.07">believe they were smart enough to</text>
  <text start="877.55" dur="7.45">basically take bodies plant evidence to</text>
  <text start="881.31" dur="5.31">show you know they were killed by</text>
  <text start="885" dur="2.94">chemical weapons I don&amp;#39;t think they</text>
  <text start="886.62" dur="3.75">thought it was gonna go that far I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="887.94" dur="4.53">even think they thought the OPCW was</text>
  <text start="890.37" dur="4.38">going to even inspect the area because</text>
  <text start="892.47" dur="6.54">the other times there was no inspection</text>
  <text start="894.75" dur="7.29">there made their ruling just by looking</text>
  <text start="899.01" dur="6.33">at social media listening to reports and</text>
  <text start="902.04" dur="6.09">that&amp;#39;s it and now we have a group that</text>
  <text start="905.34" dur="5.28">is on the ground taking a hundred</text>
  <text start="908.13" dur="4.83">different samples of the soil looking at</text>
  <text start="910.62" dur="3.69">bodies looking at the evidence and this</text>
  <text start="912.96" dur="3.42">is when things start to really fall</text>
  <text start="914.31" dur="4.67">apart now yesterday we mentioned there</text>
  <text start="916.38" dur="5.07">was a wc-130 reconnaissance aircraft</text>
  <text start="918.98" dur="5.17">belonging to the Puerto Rican National</text>
  <text start="921.45" dur="6.29">Guard and crashed outside the area of</text>
  <text start="924.15" dur="5.85">Savannah Hilton the Hilton Head area and</text>
  <text start="927.74" dur="5.17">basically there were nine people on</text>
  <text start="930" dur="4.56">board and they died during the crash and</text>
  <text start="932.91" dur="6.69">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this is</text>
  <text start="934.56" dur="7.32">that this plane was in Puerto Rico in</text>
  <text start="939.6" dur="5.88">October 2017 in the aftermath of</text>
  <text start="941.88" dur="7.86">Hurricane Maria Trump said under this</text>
  <text start="945.48" dur="7.56">exact same wc-130 age during a meeting</text>
  <text start="949.74" dur="4.62">about the disaster response efforts you</text>
  <text start="953.04" dur="4.05">can see the last four digits of the</text>
  <text start="954.36" dur="5.37">serial oh nine six eight on the aircraft</text>
  <text start="957.09" dur="6.03">so this was the aircraft that went down</text>
  <text start="959.73" dur="5.61">and Trump was there and he was sitting</text>
  <text start="963.12" dur="4.65">right next to the aircraft so this is</text>
  <text start="965.34" dur="5.04">very interesting so was this a message</text>
  <text start="967.77" dur="5.76">because it&amp;#39;s starting to seem like this</text>
  <text start="970.38" dur="5.94">was a message to Trump and the other</text>
  <text start="973.53" dur="4.92">thing is that this US military plane was</text>
  <text start="976.32" dur="5.82">on a final trip when it crashed in</text>
  <text start="978.45" dur="6">Georgia plus these planes they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="982.14" dur="5.85">around for 60 years now</text>
  <text start="984.45" dur="6.449">the these planes they just don&amp;#39;t crash</text>
  <text start="987.99" dur="6.029">on their own not when they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="990.899" dur="5.341">being maintained by the military so this</text>
  <text start="994.019" dur="4.771">is kind of odd in itself and it&amp;#39;s odd</text>
  <text start="996.24" dur="5.01">that this is the same exact plane that</text>
  <text start="998.79" dur="3.539">Trump was sitting under and again we</text>
  <text start="1001.25" dur="3.209">know with all the ships and the other</text>
  <text start="1002.329" dur="4.591">planes that there are messages going</text>
  <text start="1004.459" dur="5.401">back and forth where there&amp;#39;s a shadow</text>
  <text start="1006.92" dur="6.84">battle going on and we can see that this</text>
  <text start="1009.86" dur="6.479">is most likely part of it now q drop</text>
  <text start="1013.76" dur="5.189">some more posts and one of the posts was</text>
  <text start="1016.339" dur="5.521">a plane and it looks like it might be a</text>
  <text start="1018.949" dur="4.14">JetBlue plane again there was no text</text>
  <text start="1021.86" dur="3.54">with this whatsoever these were just</text>
  <text start="1023.089" dur="4.47">pictures there was also another picture</text>
  <text start="1025.4" dur="6.63">of a round building which is the</text>

  <text start="1032.03" dur="4.769">a circular building so we know that is</text>

  <text start="1060.5" dur="4.77">or something from Apple on the plane</text>
  <text start="1063.35" dur="3.9">because we have the plane which is</text>
  <text start="1065.27" dur="3.899">JetBlue and we have a picture of the</text>
  <text start="1067.25" dur="5.34">Apple building we also have another</text>

  <text start="1075.77" dur="7.44">this building is in Hong Kong so we have</text>
  <text start="1079.82" dur="6.27">JetBlue plane we have the Apple building</text>
  <text start="1083.21" dur="4.41">we have the another Apple building which</text>
  <text start="1086.09" dur="7.829">is in Hong Kong and then we have a</text>
  <text start="1087.62" dur="10.799">picture of either a truck or a container</text>
  <text start="1093.919" dur="6.091">on an airplane with something in the</text>

  <text start="1102.44" dur="4.229">there&amp;#39;s two of them and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1103.64" dur="6.15">something else on top so basically what</text>
  <text start="1106.669" dur="5.821">is in this package we don&amp;#39;t know now one</text>
  <text start="1109.79" dur="4.98">thing we do know is that Apple has been</text>
  <text start="1112.49" dur="5.79">against the US government intelligence</text>
  <text start="1114.77" dur="6.81">agencies from basically spying</text>
  <text start="1118.28" dur="5.31">on computer hardware and if we look at</text>
  <text start="1121.58" dur="6.6">what Apple has been doing they were</text>
  <text start="1123.59" dur="7.83">going to design their own servers to</text>
  <text start="1128.18" dur="5.34">avoid government snooping so they were</text>
  <text start="1131.42" dur="3.81">going to look at every single chip they</text>
  <text start="1133.52" dur="5.04">were gonna find out what all these chips</text>
  <text start="1135.23" dur="5.52">were doing in the other servers and they</text>
  <text start="1138.56" dur="8.01">were going to basically create their</text>
  <text start="1140.75" dur="8.91">server where there is no hidden software</text>
  <text start="1146.57" dur="4.83">in these chips so you couldn&amp;#39;t spy on</text>
  <text start="1149.66" dur="4.53">the servers just like their iPhone</text>
  <text start="1151.4" dur="4.11">when Comey kept on saying we need to get</text>
  <text start="1154.19" dur="3.33">into these iPhones we need the</text>
  <text start="1155.51" dur="4.59">encryption we need the information and</text>
  <text start="1157.52" dur="5.7">Apple kept on saying no we&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="1160.1" dur="5.28">to do this so again are these servers</text>
  <text start="1163.22" dur="6">that they&amp;#39;re being shipped maybe to Hong</text>
  <text start="1165.38" dur="6.81">Kong because Trump did tweet our great</text>
  <text start="1169.22" dur="5.37">financial team is in China trying to</text>
  <text start="1172.19" dur="5.31">negotiate a level playing field on trade</text>

  <text start="1177.5" dur="5.4">in the not-too-distant future we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1179.96" dur="7.05">always have a good great relationship so</text>
  <text start="1182.9" dur="6.71">are they shipping them servers that the</text>
  <text start="1187.01" dur="4.86">intelligence agencies and others cannot</text>
  <text start="1189.61" dur="4.68">hear what they&amp;#39;re saying see what</text>
  <text start="1191.87" dur="6.99">they&amp;#39;re saying find out information</text>
  <text start="1194.29" dur="9.01">maybe Trump has also previously tweeted</text>
  <text start="1198.86" dur="6.99">about Tim Cook so right now we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1203.3" dur="4.89">know exactly what&amp;#39;s in there but Q has</text>
  <text start="1205.85" dur="4.11">done a lot of drops regarding phones in</text>
  <text start="1208.19" dur="5.4">the past and at least one drop</text>
  <text start="1209.96" dur="6.27">concerning Apple and we know that every</text>
  <text start="1213.59" dur="5.01">smartphone is a spying device we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="1216.23" dur="4.95">being tracked we also have to think back</text>
  <text start="1218.6" dur="5.28">to the drop about the three scientists</text>
  <text start="1221.18" dur="4.68">who were killed for researching mobile</text>
  <text start="1223.88" dur="3.99">phone relay signals to end-users and</text>
  <text start="1225.86" dur="5.01">their research subsequently made</text>
  <text start="1227.87" dur="5.7">classified we also know from q drops</text>
  <text start="1230.87" dur="4.74">that signals can be sent to certain</text>
  <text start="1233.57" dur="4.86">individuals to trigger pre-program</text>
  <text start="1235.61" dur="5.1">responses such as going on shooting</text>

  <text start="1242.36" dur="5.6">Q came on and said we can control</text>
  <text start="1244.67" dur="5.93">innocence so is Trump shipping</text>
  <text start="1247.96" dur="5.58">technology where</text>
  <text start="1250.6" dur="4.83">the establishment the deep state can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1253.54" dur="5.73">penetrate and they&amp;#39;re shipping it to</text>
  <text start="1255.43" dur="7.19">Hong Kong is that what&amp;#39;s happening maybe</text>
  <text start="1259.27" dur="6.08">maybe not but an Annan took the</text>
  <text start="1262.62" dur="4.75">information and broke down a timeline of</text>
  <text start="1265.35" dur="5.1">what is going on here</text>
  <text start="1267.37" dur="6.48">Trump meets Apple iPhones and Mac&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1270.45" dur="6.58">comped by clowns Trump just met with</text>

  <text start="1277.03" dur="3.98">stores to ban certain Chinese phones</text>
  <text start="1279.16" dur="4.38">amid spying concerns</text>
  <text start="1281.01" dur="4.96">remember WikiLeaks volt 7 revealed that</text>
  <text start="1283.54" dur="6.63">clowns compromised iPhones and Apple</text>
  <text start="1285.97" dur="7.19">computers at the factory and once again</text>
  <text start="1290.17" dur="6.69">are these the servers that they created</text>
  <text start="1293.16" dur="7.42">where nobody can get into but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1296.86" dur="6.03">review what Q gave us someone left was</text>
  <text start="1300.58" dur="3.93">allowed to leave California presumably</text>
  <text start="1302.89" dur="4.08">someone who had been to Apple</text>
  <text start="1304.51" dur="4.53">headquarters a trusted international</text>
  <text start="1306.97" dur="3.69">Apple representative there was a</text>
  <text start="1309.04" dur="3.06">shipment involved either acquired</text>
  <text start="1310.66" dur="4.2">through normal channels or possibly</text>
  <text start="1312.1" dur="6.51">seized and it may have either been</text>
  <text start="1314.86" dur="5.52">coming from or going to Hong Kong we</text>
  <text start="1318.61" dur="7.35">also know that Trump met with Tim Cook</text>
  <text start="1320.38" dur="7.26">and we can see that there are lots of</text>
  <text start="1325.96" dur="5.52">problems with the Intelligence Agency</text>
  <text start="1327.64" dur="5.58">with these type of devices so once again</text>
  <text start="1331.48" dur="5.22">we don&amp;#39;t have all the information</text>
  <text start="1333.22" dur="5.49">maybe Q will drop some more breadcrumbs</text>
  <text start="1336.7" dur="3.3">to give us some more information again</text>
  <text start="1338.71" dur="3.59">these were just pictures there were no</text>
  <text start="1340" dur="5.94">texts here but we can see right now</text>
  <text start="1342.3" dur="5.32">there is no coincidences Q continually</text>
  <text start="1345.94" dur="3.27">says this and I do believe there are no</text>
  <text start="1347.62" dur="3.75">coincidences everything&amp;#39;s happening for</text>
  <text start="1349.21" dur="5.16">a reason everything is being maneuvered</text>
  <text start="1351.37" dur="4.68">for a reason as we can see and from the</text>
  <text start="1354.37" dur="4.14">pose and if we go back in time we can</text>
  <text start="1356.05" dur="5.07">see that yes things are being done for a</text>
  <text start="1358.51" dur="4.35">specific reasons to box the deep state</text>
  <text start="1361.12" dur="3.18">in they feel like they&amp;#39;re winning they</text>
  <text start="1362.86" dur="3.42">feel like they have the upper hand and</text>
  <text start="1364.3" dur="4.56">then everything is turned around and</text>
  <text start="1366.28" dur="5.28">once again this is what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1368.86" dur="5.19">right now something is happening</text>
  <text start="1371.56" dur="4.29">something is being pushed and I believe</text>
  <text start="1374.05" dur="4.89">very soon we&amp;#39;re gonna get more and more</text>
  <text start="1375.85" dur="6.12">answers but we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="1378.94" dur="5.52">deep state they are falling right into</text>
  <text start="1381.97" dur="5.07">the trap like they always do</text>
  <text start="1384.46" dur="4.59">and they are becoming weaker and weaker</text>
  <text start="1387.04" dur="3.42">as time goes on they&amp;#39;re losing Syria</text>
  <text start="1389.05" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re losing Iraq they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="1390.46" dur="5.16">Lebanon the losing Libya everything that</text>
  <text start="1393.13" dur="4.05">they push for all this time it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1395.62" dur="4.5">working out for them they lost North</text>
  <text start="1397.18" dur="5.46">Korea and the next is Iran and we can</text>
  <text start="1400.12" dur="5.01">see that plan that part of the plan is</text>
  <text start="1402.64" dur="5.54">already being pushed I don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="1405.13" dur="5.73">it&amp;#39;s to basically get rid of the entire</text>
  <text start="1408.18" dur="5.47">Iranian deal I think there are certain</text>
  <text start="1410.86" dur="5.1">portions of the Iranian deal that Trump</text>
  <text start="1413.65" dur="5.19">and the Patriots want people to look at</text>
  <text start="1415.96" dur="4.65">to see what is going on and that is the</text>
  <text start="1418.84" dur="4.35">real push and I think we&amp;#39;re gonna see a</text>
  <text start="1420.61" dur="4.2">lot more coming up during this weekend</text>
