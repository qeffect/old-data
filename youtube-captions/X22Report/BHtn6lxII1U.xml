  <text start="140.97" dur="6.03">is not the start this is letting</text>
  <text start="143.55" dur="5.939">everyone know that the central bank they</text>
  <text start="147" dur="5.4">can&amp;#39;t control the illusion anymore</text>
  <text start="149.489" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s all this means we&amp;#39;ve been going</text>
  <text start="152.4" dur="6.87">through the clubs we&amp;#39;ve been tracking</text>
  <text start="153.959" dur="8.461">the collapse I mean today they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="159.27" dur="5.07">pushing the meme that we are in this</text>
  <text start="162.42" dur="4.319">fabulous recovery</text>
  <text start="164.34" dur="4.259">they&amp;#39;re telling us right now and when I</text>
  <text start="166.739" dur="4.681">say they it&amp;#39;s the US government central</text>
  <text start="168.599" dur="5.911">bankers that for the second month in a</text>
  <text start="171.42" dur="8.21">row US consumer confidence according to</text>
  <text start="174.51" dur="7.29">The Conference Board soared in September</text>
  <text start="179.63" dur="4.87">printing at a hundred and three</text>
  <text start="181.8" dur="6.63">smashing expectations of ninety six</text>
  <text start="184.5" dur="9.349">point eight and this is just shy of the</text>
  <text start="188.43" dur="8.82">highs going back to August of 2007 wait</text>
  <text start="193.849" dur="5.501">August of 2007 what happened in 2008</text>
  <text start="197.25" dur="5.01">that&amp;#39;s right the market completely</text>
  <text start="199.35" dur="7.5">collapsed actually we were going through</text>
  <text start="202.26" dur="6.72">the collapse in August of 2007 this is</text>
  <text start="206.85" dur="4.169">when things really started to ramp up</text>
  <text start="208.98" dur="3.69">but of course nobody talked about it and</text>
  <text start="211.019" dur="9.141">we have to remember one important thing</text>
  <text start="212.67" dur="11.7">here the conference board is basically</text>
  <text start="220.16" dur="6.82">funded by the government it&amp;#39;s government</text>
  <text start="224.37" dur="5.209">sponsored and what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="226.98" dur="5.25">about all this the Yuma CH which is</text>
  <text start="229.579" dur="5.711">signaling a complete opposite of the</text>
  <text start="232.23" dur="6.479">conference board the Gallup poll which</text>
  <text start="235.29" dur="6.39">is a poll of the people is signaling a</text>
  <text start="238.709" dur="8.31">complete opposite of the conference</text>
  <text start="241.68" dur="11.16">board you start to realize that they are</text>
  <text start="247.019" dur="9.631">using every type of weapon they have in</text>
  <text start="252.84" dur="6.81">their arsenal to keep this illusion</text>
  <text start="256.65" dur="4.399">alive to keep you everyone fooled of</text>
  <text start="259.65" dur="5.46">what&amp;#39;s really going on</text>
  <text start="261.049" dur="6.131">so back in August 2007 the conference</text>
  <text start="265.11" dur="3.69">board which is sponsored by the</text>
  <text start="267.18" dur="4.02">government was telling us that</text>
  <text start="268.8" dur="5.4">everything was fine moving forward</text>
  <text start="271.2" dur="5.46">through 2008 the conference board</text>
  <text start="274.2" dur="2.91">continually told us that everything was</text>
  <text start="276.66" dur="3.479">fine</text>
  <text start="277.11" dur="4.86">even the Fed came out in 2008 and said</text>
  <text start="280.139" dur="4.141">there is absolutely no recession</text>
  <text start="281.97" dur="4.23">whatsoever being forecasted at this</text>
  <text start="284.28" dur="3.78">point we don&amp;#39;t see anything in the</text>
  <text start="286.2" dur="4.08">future indicating that there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="288.06" dur="5.55">be any type of problems and then we know</text>
  <text start="290.28" dur="6.27">what happened so we know they lie to the</text>
  <text start="293.61" dur="4.47">people we know they use these techniques</text>
  <text start="296.55" dur="2.91">to keep the illusion</text>
  <text start="298.08" dur="6.66">and this is what they&amp;#39;re doing but we</text>
  <text start="299.46" dur="7.679">are seeing mass layoffs I mean a and P</text>
  <text start="304.74" dur="4.859">and their headquarters laying off 319</text>
  <text start="307.139" dur="8.911">people we understand that Deutsche</text>
  <text start="309.599" dur="8.04">UniCredit Heinz corporation HP laying</text>
  <text start="316.05" dur="3.57">off and there&amp;#39;s many many others I mean</text>
  <text start="317.639" dur="4.141">you could just name all here they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="319.62" dur="3.87">laying off thousands upon thousands of</text>
  <text start="321.78" dur="5.009">people I mean Deutsche Bank 23,000</text>
  <text start="323.49" dur="8.87">UniCredit 10,000 HP 30,000 Microsoft</text>
  <text start="326.789" dur="7.41">7800 Heinz 2500 and now Bank of America</text>
  <text start="332.36" dur="4.779">now they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="334.199" dur="7.65">cutting a hundreds of jobs they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="337.139" dur="6.21">have the final count yet and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="341.849" dur="3.81">have to watch this very closely because</text>
  <text start="343.349" dur="5.72">we&amp;#39;re starting to see the signs all</text>
  <text start="345.659" dur="7.741">these indicators letting us know yeah</text>
  <text start="349.069" dur="6.34">something bad is headed our way we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="353.4" dur="4.799">getting the economic indicators right</text>
  <text start="355.409" dur="5.521">now this is what happened prior to 2008</text>
  <text start="358.199" dur="5.22">if you remember in the summer months</text>
  <text start="360.93" dur="4.59">leading up to the big stock market</text>
  <text start="363.419" dur="4.43">crashing let me remind everyone during</text>
  <text start="365.52" dur="5.459">the summer month going into September</text>
  <text start="367.849" dur="6.701">the market was fluctuating the way it is</text>
  <text start="370.979" dur="7.41">now and then there were warnings Bear</text>
  <text start="374.55" dur="5.489">Stearns Lehman things that were</text>
  <text start="378.389" dur="4.851">happening in the background that people</text>
  <text start="380.039" dur="8.041">didn&amp;#39;t even know about like AIG and</text>
  <text start="383.24" dur="7.45">we&amp;#39;re hearing this once again we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="388.08" dur="5.16">hearing things that sound like Lehman</text>
  <text start="390.69" dur="5.46">Brothers in 2008 but this company is</text>
  <text start="393.24" dur="4.5">called Glencore which is the largest</text>
  <text start="396.15" dur="4.319">commodities trading company of the</text>
  <text start="397.74" dur="5.549">entire planet and at one time it was</text>
  <text start="400.469" dur="5.82">ranked as the tenth biggest company in</text>
  <text start="403.289" dur="5.071">the world it right now I mean the</text>
  <text start="406.289" dur="4.771">company is linked to trillions of</text>
  <text start="408.36" dur="7.19">dollars of derivatives which is traded</text>
  <text start="411.06" dur="8.4">globally and if this firm if it were to</text>
  <text start="415.55" dur="5.919">collapse implode on itself it would be a</text>
  <text start="419.46" dur="5.549">complete financial debt disaster unlike</text>
  <text start="421.469" dur="7.5">anything we&amp;#39;ve seen in Europe since the</text>
  <text start="425.009" dur="6.571">end of World War two unfortunately all</text>
  <text start="428.969" dur="5.341">signs are pointing to an inescapable</text>
  <text start="431.58" dur="7.44">death spiral for Glencore at this point</text>
  <text start="434.31" dur="8.22">I mean it is completely imploding right</text>
  <text start="439.02" dur="7.169">now but of course everyone&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="442.53" dur="8.099">keep this quiet we see Deutsche Bank the</text>
  <text start="446.189" dur="6.151">same exact problems but they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="450.629" dur="5.04">try to keep the illusion alive that</text>
  <text start="452.34" dur="5.4">everything is fine but as we look at</text>
  <text start="455.669" dur="4.981">more and more of these economic</text>
  <text start="457.74" dur="5.609">indicators we find that no things are</text>
  <text start="460.65" dur="3.96">not fine actually they&amp;#39;re accelerating</text>
  <text start="463.349" dur="5.22">to the downside</text>
  <text start="464.61" dur="7.07">I mean US retail sales in September the</text>
  <text start="468.569" dur="10.491">chain store sales fell by 1.5 percent in</text>
  <text start="471.68" dur="10.63">the first four weeks of September I mean</text>
  <text start="479.06" dur="6.03">think about what&amp;#39;s happening here people</text>
  <text start="482.31" dur="6.96">are losing their jobs they can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="485.09" dur="6.129">the same high paying job a lot of people</text>
  <text start="489.27" dur="3.06">are applying for unemployment but of</text>
  <text start="491.219" dur="2.611">course the government&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="492.33" dur="2.82">show that because then it will show that</text>
  <text start="493.83" dur="4.23">people are being laid off and we have to</text>
  <text start="495.15" dur="4.56">remember back in 2013 the government got</text>
  <text start="498.06" dur="3.569">rid of that department that counts</text>
  <text start="499.71" dur="4.829">layoffs so they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="501.629" dur="5.521">information showing up everywhere so</text>
  <text start="504.539" dur="5.49">they just ignore it geez you&amp;#39;re done</text>
  <text start="507.15" dur="4.61">just ignoring it but we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="510.029" dur="5.31">see that it&amp;#39;s really starting to take</text>
  <text start="511.76" dur="6.13">its toll on the economy and as we move</text>
  <text start="515.339" dur="5.88">into this holiday season where we see</text>
  <text start="517.89" dur="6.66">where we normally see sales increasing</text>
  <text start="521.219" dur="5.161">people getting in that mood that</text>
  <text start="524.55" dur="5.039">holidays are coming we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="526.38" dur="6.42">spending more we&amp;#39;re seeing the opposite</text>
  <text start="529.589" dur="5.821">I mean the market is fluctuating layoffs</text>
  <text start="532.8" dur="5.31">are being announced people are nervous</text>
  <text start="535.41" dur="4.35">in their jobs because they see other</text>
  <text start="538.11" dur="6.81">people being laid off they don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="539.76" dur="8.13">they&amp;#39;re gonna be next and now and we</text>
  <text start="544.92" dur="5.46">talked about this over and over about</text>
  <text start="547.89" dur="6.18">real estate about how prices are coming</text>
  <text start="550.38" dur="5.19">down now I mentioned this back in April</text>
  <text start="554.07" dur="4.23">May when I started to first notice that</text>
  <text start="555.57" dur="5.67">house prices were coming down we moved</text>
  <text start="558.3" dur="5.159">into the summer summers normally the hot</text>
  <text start="561.24" dur="3.44">season no pun intended there for real</text>
  <text start="563.459" dur="5.301">estate</text>
  <text start="564.68" dur="6.99">and normally you see house is being sold</text>
  <text start="568.76" dur="5.639">left and right but we saw existing home</text>
  <text start="571.67" dur="5.16">sales pending home sales completely</text>
  <text start="574.399" dur="3.931">crashed the only surge was new</text>
  <text start="576.83" dur="3.15">construction but that didn&amp;#39;t make any</text>
  <text start="578.33" dur="5.629">sense because lumber prices lumber</text>
  <text start="579.98" dur="6.54">demand home furnishing stores consume</text>
  <text start="583.959" dur="5.5">home-improvement stores their sales</text>
  <text start="586.52" dur="6.33">decline so this absolutely made no sense</text>
  <text start="589.459" dur="4.801">whatsoever so if we didn&amp;#39;t see it an</text>
  <text start="592.85" dur="3.48">existing we didn&amp;#39;t see it an impending</text>
  <text start="594.26" dur="5.18">but people are just coming out of the</text>
  <text start="596.33" dur="7.5">woodwork to buy new construction and</text>
  <text start="599.44" dur="6.82">right now Case Shiller and this is for</text>
  <text start="603.83" dur="5.52">the fifth month in a row home prices</text>
  <text start="606.26" dur="6">missed expectations and dropped by 0.2%</text>
  <text start="609.35" dur="7.92">month on month in July the biggest drop</text>
  <text start="612.26" dur="8.94">since July of 2014 now remember they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="617.27" dur="7.319">talking about July now in the news we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="621.2" dur="5.759">in the end of September going into</text>
  <text start="624.589" dur="4.381">October so they&amp;#39;re a little bit behind</text>
  <text start="626.959" dur="2.791">the times here and they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="628.97" dur="3.42">show us that</text>
  <text start="629.75" dur="5.64">yeah prices are starting to level off</text>
  <text start="632.39" dur="5.91">and come down now well now at this point</text>
  <text start="635.39" dur="6.84">moving into October October prices are</text>
  <text start="638.3" dur="9">way down houses are on the market longer</text>
  <text start="642.23" dur="6.81">and longer and we&amp;#39;re seeing that prices</text>
  <text start="647.3" dur="4.08">have hit a plateau and this was back</text>
  <text start="649.04" dur="4.86">really in May and they&amp;#39;ve been coming</text>
  <text start="651.38" dur="7.2">down ever since what does that tell us</text>
  <text start="653.9" dur="10.53">it tells us that the real estate market</text>
  <text start="658.58" dur="8.16">is coming apart that people can&amp;#39;t sell</text>
  <text start="664.43" dur="4.89">their homes a lot of people are still</text>
  <text start="666.74" dur="4.26">living in that fantasy that everything</text>
  <text start="669.32" dur="3.24">is okay and we&amp;#39;re gonna put our house up</text>
  <text start="671" dur="3.54">for the highest price because they</text>
  <text start="672.56" dur="4.86">listen to the corporate media and they</text>
  <text start="674.54" dur="5.22">don&amp;#39;t understand why the house isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="677.42" dur="6.18">being sold or why they had to come down</text>
  <text start="679.76" dur="5.67">in price to get it sold and this is how</text>
  <text start="683.6" dur="7.95">it begins and it&amp;#39;s starting to spread</text>
  <text start="685.43" dur="9.36">now so Case Shiller reported earlier</text>
  <text start="691.55" dur="5.94">that the prices are a little bit weaker</text>
  <text start="694.79" dur="3.73">than they expected and the 20-city</text>
  <text start="697.49" dur="3.43">composite index</text>
  <text start="698.52" dur="5.46">posted its third monthly decline in a</text>
  <text start="700.92" dur="10.08">row and when we look at this we see now</text>
  <text start="703.98" dur="9.63">ten cities where prices are falling Los</text>
  <text start="711" dur="6.09">Angeles Seattle Charlotte</text>
  <text start="713.61" dur="8.49">Tampa Atlanta Washington Miami New York</text>
  <text start="717.09" dur="7.5">Minneapolis Detroit Chicago it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="722.1" dur="6.81">starting to spread around the country</text>
  <text start="724.59" dur="9.03">and it will continue remember they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="728.91" dur="7.32">going back to July to tell us what is</text>

  <text start="1271.35" dur="5.88">because they know that this system right</text>
  <text start="1274.59" dur="8">now that we&amp;#39;re in the dollar which has</text>

  <text start="1321.42" dur="5.79">really a benefit for the people because</text>
  <text start="1323.79" dur="6.24">really what did you get from it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1327.21" dur="4.38">low-cost insurance actually the cost as</text>

  <text start="1347.43" dur="5.67">all come together we&amp;#39;ll set a level</text>
  <text start="1350.52" dur="4.35">premium well say yeah anybody can come</text>
  <text start="1353.1" dur="5.4">in because we&amp;#39;re gonna set the premium</text>
  <text start="1354.87" dur="5.31">higher and everyone has to accept it</text>
  <text start="1358.5" dur="3.09">well that&amp;#39;s gonna be a problem how we</text>
  <text start="1360.18" dur="4.05">gonna get everyone accepted I know</text>
  <text start="1361.59" dur="4.04">penalize them if they don&amp;#39;t because we</text>
  <text start="1364.23" dur="3.74">need everyone in</text>
  <text start="1365.63" dur="6.3">paying these higher premiums and once we</text>
  <text start="1367.97" dur="6.18">have everyone into the system there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1371.93" dur="6.06">more competition we can raise these</text>
  <text start="1374.15" dur="7.58">premiums however we want and with these</text>
  <text start="1377.99" dur="6.15">plans we can give them high deductibles</text>
  <text start="1381.73" dur="5.11">so this way we don&amp;#39;t have to pay out</text>
  <text start="1384.14" dur="8.85">that much so what did they really give</text>
  <text start="1386.84" dur="12.57">us nothing absolutely nothing you could</text>
  <text start="1392.99" dur="9.21">have gotten this on your own so right</text>
  <text start="1399.41" dur="5.73">now we see Obama care they need he needs</text>
  <text start="1402.2" dur="5.51">some twenty two million more people in</text>
