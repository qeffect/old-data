  <text start="61.64" dur="5.73">December 8th 2017 and the tot of the</text>
  <text start="64.729" dur="5.401">episode is central banks want to replace</text>
  <text start="67.37" dur="5.97">the US dollar with a single global super</text>
  <text start="70.13" dur="6">currency let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="73.34" dur="4.98">collapse financial news now the child</text>
  <text start="76.13" dur="4.86">numbers came out today and the</text>
  <text start="78.32" dur="4.68">unemployment numbers the percentage is</text>
  <text start="80.99" dur="4.23">staying around 4.1 percent it really</text>
  <text start="83" dur="4.32">hasn&amp;#39;t moved but they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="85.22" dur="4.08">convince us and this is coming from the</text>
  <text start="87.32" dur="4.77">BLS that you know there are just more</text>
  <text start="89.3" dur="4.62">jobs out there we&amp;#39;ve added about two</text>
  <text start="92.09" dur="5.76">hundred and twenty eight thousand jobs</text>
  <text start="93.92" dur="6.39">and when we look at the numbers we see</text>
  <text start="97.85" dur="6.06">that a lot of the jobs were retail temp</text>
  <text start="100.31" dur="7.26">workers some in the health care leisure</text>
  <text start="103.91" dur="5.069">and hospitality and first of all when we</text>
  <text start="107.57" dur="3.42">break down the numbers and we really</text>
  <text start="108.979" dur="5.31">look at this we need to realize that</text>
  <text start="110.99" dur="6">well let&amp;#39;s see retail thousands upon</text>
  <text start="114.289" dur="5.131">thousands of stores are closing many</text>
  <text start="116.99" dur="4.2">have gone bankrupt yes we are in the</text>
  <text start="119.42" dur="6.21">holiday season and they do count the</text>
  <text start="121.19" dur="7.23">temp jobs as a job we see a lot of jobs</text>
  <text start="125.63" dur="5.7">in the food service area waiters and</text>
  <text start="128.42" dur="6.06">bartenders and that hit an all-time new</text>
  <text start="131.33" dur="5.73">high and we need to understand that the</text>
  <text start="134.48" dur="5.91">restaurants performance index well that</text>
  <text start="137.06" dur="5.22">has been declining so once again the BLS</text>
  <text start="140.39" dur="3.09">is just throwing these numbers in and</text>
  <text start="142.28" dur="3.69">you have to remember how they get the</text>
  <text start="143.48" dur="3.839">numbers for retail just because retail</text>
  <text start="145.97" dur="3.66">stores are closing or they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="147.319" dur="5.101">bankrupt and people are losing jobs they</text>
  <text start="149.63" dur="4.079">don&amp;#39;t just remove them they remove them</text>
  <text start="152.42" dur="4.38">overtime</text>
  <text start="153.709" dur="5.311">same thing with retail sales and this is</text>
  <text start="156.8" dur="5.82">what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing where they use</text>
  <text start="159.02" dur="5.31">special manipulated formulas to say oh</text>
  <text start="162.62" dur="3.33">yeah yeah the retail stores have closed</text>
  <text start="164.33" dur="3.42">but we&amp;#39;re gonna drag this out for the</text>
  <text start="165.95" dur="3.539">rest of the year and say that you know</text>
  <text start="167.75" dur="3.87">nothing has really happened plus we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="169.489" dur="4.411">seeing other part-time jobs come on</text>
  <text start="171.62" dur="3.6">board during the holiday season and</text>
  <text start="173.9" dur="3.21">we&amp;#39;re just going to count that as a</text>
  <text start="175.22" dur="4.32">full-time job so everything looks</text>
  <text start="177.11" dur="4.769">fantastic and this is what the BLS has</text>
  <text start="179.54" dur="3.99">been doing for a very long time and what</text>
  <text start="181.879" dur="5.071">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is manipulation</text>
  <text start="183.53" dur="5.28">to the max now we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="186.95" dur="3.96">all these bubbles we have the student</text>
  <text start="188.81" dur="3.75">loan bubble with the auto loan bubble we</text>
  <text start="190.91" dur="3.2">have the bomb bubble we have a stock</text>
  <text start="192.56" dur="3.929">market bubble the housing bubble</text>
  <text start="194.11" dur="5.709">basically what it is it&amp;#39;s the everything</text>
  <text start="196.489" dur="6.511">bubble and we can see right now that we</text>
  <text start="199.819" dur="6">are heading towards a period of time</text>
  <text start="203" dur="5.73">where the everything bubble is really</text>
  <text start="205.819" dur="6.121">getting out of control</text>
  <text start="208.73" dur="6.3">now when we look at this we can see that</text>
  <text start="211.94" dur="5.01">we might be near the end of the bond</text>
  <text start="215.03" dur="4.89">bubble why do I say this</text>
  <text start="216.95" dur="4.8">well back in June the world saw the</text>
  <text start="219.92" dur="6.03">unveiling of perhaps the single most</text>
  <text start="221.75" dur="7.98">insane investment of all time a 100-year</text>
  <text start="225.95" dur="6.18">bond now to make matters more insane the</text>
  <text start="229.73" dur="5.43">countries that were issuing these bonds</text>
  <text start="232.13" dur="4.52">Argentina and Austria both have</text>
  <text start="235.16" dur="5.04">experienced numerous sovereign debt</text>
  <text start="236.65" dur="5.74">crises in the last 100 years most</text>
  <text start="240.2" dur="4.89">recently Austria almost went bust in</text>
  <text start="242.39" dur="4.59">2015 in Argentina only just resolved</text>
  <text start="245.09" dur="5.39">resolved its issues with debt holders</text>
  <text start="246.98" dur="7.44">from its 2001 default last year in 2016</text>
  <text start="250.48" dur="6.159">now of course 100 year bonds are not</text>
  <text start="254.42" dur="6.93">entirely new Belgium and Ireland issued</text>
  <text start="256.639" dur="7.831">100 year bonds in 2016 so we need to put</text>
  <text start="261.35" dur="4.8">this in simple terms two countries both</text>
  <text start="264.47" dur="4.29">of which struggle with sovereign debt</text>
  <text start="266.15" dur="5.37">issues in the last four years saw</text>
  <text start="268.76" dur="5.82">investors placed between 3 and $4 in</text>
  <text start="271.52" dur="5.369">bids for every $1 and new debt issuance</text>
  <text start="274.58" dur="6.99">on a 100 year bonds</text>
  <text start="276.889" dur="7.891">this is beyond insanity it is the</text>
  <text start="281.57" dur="5.94">textbook definition of a bubble and it</text>
  <text start="284.78" dur="6.87">indicates we are nearing the end of the</text>
  <text start="287.51" dur="6.96">line for this current bubble this is why</text>
  <text start="291.65" dur="7.489">you need to prepare before the carnage</text>
  <text start="294.47" dur="9.509">hits and we see that China Russia Iran</text>
  <text start="299.139" dur="8.53">India the BRIC nations they&amp;#39;re planning</text>
  <text start="303.979" dur="5.37">to move to a different currency and we</text>
  <text start="307.669" dur="4.5">know that China and Iran and Russia</text>
  <text start="309.349" dur="6.421">they&amp;#39;ve been making bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="312.169" dur="5.821">agreements with all these countries</text>
  <text start="315.77" dur="4.17">where they&amp;#39;re bypassing the dollar and</text>
  <text start="317.99" dur="2.67">if we go back in time we need to</text>
  <text start="319.94" dur="3">understand</text>
  <text start="320.66" dur="4.89">at the reserve currency status it</text>
  <text start="322.94" dur="5.64">doesn&amp;#39;t last forever if we go to</text>
  <text start="325.55" dur="6.45">Portugal back in the 1400s it only</text>
  <text start="328.58" dur="5.82">lasted about something like 50 years</text>
  <text start="332" dur="4.92">same thing with Spain the Netherlands</text>
  <text start="334.4" dur="6.06">France Britain and then finally the u.s.</text>
  <text start="336.92" dur="7.19">and here we are at the end now the</text>
  <text start="340.46" dur="6.9">central banks as we know they want a</text>
  <text start="344.11" dur="5.59">different currency and the central</text>
  <text start="347.36" dur="4.68">bank&amp;#39;s former chief economist wants to</text>
  <text start="349.7" dur="5.97">replace the US dollar with a single</text>
  <text start="352.04" dur="6.09">global super currency saying it will</text>
  <text start="355.67" dur="5.28">create a more stable global financial</text>
  <text start="358.13" dur="5.76">system well let me translate that for</text>
  <text start="360.95" dur="5.58">you that&amp;#39;ll be a one-world currency</text>
  <text start="363.89" dur="6.06">they&amp;#39;ll have control over everything and</text>
  <text start="366.53" dur="6.36">it will be better for them not for the</text>
  <text start="369.95" dur="5.37">people because that means they can issue</text>
  <text start="372.89" dur="6.15">currency from one location centralized</text>
  <text start="375.32" dur="7.17">and everyone would be on the same debt</text>
  <text start="379.04" dur="7.38">structure and this will make it easier</text>
  <text start="382.49" dur="7.43">for them to control everything and we</text>
  <text start="386.42" dur="9">see right now that the dollar regime is</text>
  <text start="389.92" dur="8.02">coming to an end now Russian President</text>
  <text start="395.42" dur="5.34">Putin said almost two months ago during</text>
  <text start="397.94" dur="5.43">its his BRICS summit he said the</text>
  <text start="400.76" dur="4.71">following Russia shares the BRICS</text>
  <text start="403.37" dur="4.049">countries concerns over the unfairness</text>
  <text start="405.47" dur="4.86">of the global financial and economic</text>
  <text start="407.419" dur="4.831">architecture which does not give due</text>
  <text start="410.33" dur="4.08">regard to the growing weight of emerging</text>
  <text start="412.25" dur="3.39">economies we are ready to work together</text>
  <text start="414.41" dur="3.09">with our partners to promote</text>
  <text start="415.64" dur="4.32">international financial regulation</text>
  <text start="417.5" dur="4.77">reforms and to overcome the excessive</text>
  <text start="419.96" dur="5.79">domination of the limited number of</text>
  <text start="422.27" dur="6.45">reserve currencies as pepe escobar</text>

  <text start="435.5" dur="5.34">have been discussing for years now how</text>
  <text start="438.23" dur="4.65">to bypass the US dollar as well as the</text>
  <text start="440.84" dur="4.23">petro dollar and we&amp;#39;re already seeing</text>
  <text start="442.88" dur="4.95">this with the Petra you want and also</text>
  <text start="445.07" dur="7.52">the petro ruble the central bankers</text>
  <text start="447.83" dur="6.6">their mission their goal is to have a</text>
  <text start="452.59" dur="5.56">central super</text>
  <text start="454.43" dur="8.489">global currency now the only thing that</text>
  <text start="458.15" dur="8.43">will stop this is if the people decide</text>
  <text start="462.919" dur="6.06">they don&amp;#39;t want this and they go towards</text>
  <text start="466.58" dur="5.429">a different currency system something</text>
  <text start="468.979" dur="5.431">maybe like crypto currencies this is why</text>
  <text start="472.009" dur="4.561">they&amp;#39;re so afraid of crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="474.41" dur="5.55">and don&amp;#39;t get me wrong</text>
  <text start="476.57" dur="8">gold and silver is still very important</text>
  <text start="479.96" dur="8.07">it ensures your wealth global currencies</text>
  <text start="484.57" dur="6.34">will be used and be issued by the people</text>
  <text start="488.03" dur="5.22">instead of central bank&amp;#39;s and you can</text>
  <text start="490.91" dur="4.41">use your assets which would be gold and</text>
  <text start="493.25" dur="5.94">silver land stocks and everything else</text>
  <text start="495.32" dur="4.14">to purchase currency I mean think about</text>
  <text start="499.19" dur="2.55">it</text>
  <text start="499.46" dur="4.32">go back many many years ago when people</text>
  <text start="501.74" dur="3.81">wanted to purchase something they would</text>
  <text start="503.78" dur="3.96">hand in the silver they would get paper</text>
  <text start="505.55" dur="7.71">currency and they would use the paper</text>
  <text start="507.74" dur="7.469">currency to basically deal in goods the</text>
  <text start="513.26" dur="5.79">same thing is going to happen once again</text>
  <text start="515.209" dur="8.061">I mean today if you had a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="519.05" dur="7.62">gold or silver and you wanted to deal</text>
  <text start="523.27" dur="5.74">with you know retail or you wanted to do</text>
  <text start="526.67" dur="5.22">anything you would have to take that</text>
  <text start="529.01" dur="5">sell it and get paper currency the same</text>
  <text start="531.89" dur="4.889">things gonna happen in the crypto world</text>
  <text start="534.01" dur="5.829">you will take your gold and silver and</text>
  <text start="536.779" dur="4.56">trade it in for the new currency if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="539.839" dur="3.481">the super global currency that the</text>
  <text start="541.339" dur="3.87">central bank&amp;#39;s want that&amp;#39;s what will</text>
  <text start="543.32" dur="5.07">happen if it&amp;#39;s the crypto currency</text>
  <text start="545.209" dur="5.551">that&amp;#39;s what will happen and this is why</text>
  <text start="548.39" dur="6.21">I&amp;#39;ve been saying you still need to have</text>
  <text start="550.76" dur="7.019">gold and silver you need to own crypto</text>
  <text start="554.6" dur="4.41">currency you have to hold dollars right</text>
  <text start="557.779" dur="3.091">now because in the beginning stages</text>
  <text start="559.01" dur="4.17">you&amp;#39;re going to need those dollars</text>
  <text start="560.87" dur="4.339">because when inflation hits and which</text>
  <text start="563.18" dur="5.18">means that the dollar is being devalued</text>
  <text start="565.209" dur="6.281">you&amp;#39;re gonna have to use that up first</text>
  <text start="568.36" dur="5.71">before you move to bartering or</text>
  <text start="571.49" dur="5.73">cryptocurrency you&amp;#39;ll keep your gold and</text>
  <text start="574.07" dur="3.54">silver you&amp;#39;ll keep it to ensure your</text>
  <text start="577.22" dur="2.25">wealth</text>
  <text start="577.61" dur="3.93">same thing with land and stocks and</text>
  <text start="579.47" dur="4.02">things like that just because we go</text>
  <text start="581.54" dur="6.56">through a reset a collapse doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="583.49" dur="7.13">everything goes to zero the dollar which</text>
  <text start="588.1" dur="4.95">paper currency will go to zero</text>
  <text start="590.62" dur="5.37">eventually and something else will take</text>
  <text start="593.05" dur="6.12">its place now we have a battle going on</text>
  <text start="595.99" dur="7.44">right now between the crypto currency</text>
  <text start="599.17" dur="6.96">market the people&amp;#39;s currency and the</text>
  <text start="603.43" dur="5.19">central banking system the central</text>
  <text start="606.13" dur="3.72">banking system they don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="608.62" dur="2.459">crypto market I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="609.85" dur="2.159">going to be able to control the way they</text>
  <text start="611.079" dur="3.031">thought they were gonna be able to</text>
  <text start="612.009" dur="5.07">control it I think it&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="614.11" dur="4.589">decentralized they can&amp;#39;t get a handle on</text>
  <text start="617.079" dur="4.68">it there&amp;#39;s too many of them out there</text>
  <text start="618.699" dur="4.461">and they would have to convince the</text>
  <text start="621.759" dur="3.991">governments they&amp;#39;d have to create laws</text>
  <text start="623.16" dur="4.15">where they say this is the crypto</text>
  <text start="625.75" dur="3.81">currency we&amp;#39;re going to use and the</text>
  <text start="627.31" dur="7.589">central banks are going to control it</text>
  <text start="629.56" dur="6.81">and will this happen we don&amp;#39;t know as of</text>
  <text start="634.899" dur="2.461">yet so what they&amp;#39;re gonna try to do and</text>
  <text start="636.37" dur="2.37">this is why they&amp;#39;re coming up with the</text>
  <text start="637.36" dur="3.36">future market they&amp;#39;re gonna try to</text>
  <text start="638.74" dur="4.44">control the crypto market in another way</text>
  <text start="640.72" dur="5.46">and this is what they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="643.18" dur="6.329">do so they can push their agenda of</text>
  <text start="646.18" dur="8.13">having a super global one-world currency</text>
  <text start="649.509" dur="8.151">that&amp;#39;s eventually what they want and we</text>
  <text start="654.31" dur="6.509">see right now the people will have to</text>
  <text start="657.66" dur="5.26">eventually say you know something we</text>
  <text start="660.819" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t need the central bank we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="662.92" dur="4.859">need it there&amp;#39;s no reason for it we have</text>
  <text start="665.319" dur="5.851">this crypto machine right now they</text>
  <text start="667.779" dur="4.351">blockchain and this is working out</text>
  <text start="671.17" dur="3.57">really well</text>
  <text start="672.13" dur="4.17">and there&amp;#39;s no reason for banks there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="674.74" dur="4.23">no reason for a central bank there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="676.3" dur="7.68">reason to create this currency with</text>
  <text start="678.97" dur="7.44">interest attached so this next battle is</text>
  <text start="683.98" dur="5.64">going to be between central banks and</text>
  <text start="686.41" dur="6.419">the crypto currency and who is going to</text>
  <text start="689.62" dur="8.73">control the next currency of the world</text>
  <text start="692.829" dur="8.82">and while this is happening everything</text>
  <text start="698.35" dur="6.179">is going to start to fall apart and is</text>
  <text start="701.649" dur="6.81">it gonna happen tomorrow maybe maybe not</text>
