  <text start="699.24" dur="6.66">most likely occur here as time goes on</text>
  <text start="702.56" dur="5.47">we also understand that government</text>
  <text start="705.9" dur="5.46">agencies are continually violating our</text>

  <text start="749.04" dur="4.71">anti-terrorism operations throughout the</text>
  <text start="751.11" dur="4.77">US but they couldn&amp;#39;t find any terrorists</text>
  <text start="753.75" dur="6.12">because they&amp;#39;re all created by the US</text>
  <text start="755.88" dur="5.58">government CIA Mossad mi6 so they had to</text>
  <text start="759.87" dur="3.6">turn it towards the people because</text>
  <text start="761.46" dur="5.64">that&amp;#39;s why they really wanted this</text>
