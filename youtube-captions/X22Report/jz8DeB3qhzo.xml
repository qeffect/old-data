  <text start="47.25" dur="5.07">moved worships they&amp;#39;ve moved a stealth</text>
  <text start="49.8" dur="4.59">destroyer all to the pacific and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="52.32" dur="4.14">setting up bases which encircle China</text>
  <text start="54.39" dur="4.559">and we understand that China has set up</text>
  <text start="56.46" dur="4.71">an air defense zone and moved many of</text>
  <text start="58.949" dur="4.41">their military assets and ships into</text>
  <text start="61.17" dur="5.76">that region and there was some type of</text>
  <text start="63.359" dur="6.271">conflict between the Chinese and the US</text>
  <text start="66.93" dur="4.68">warships where they almost collided but</text>
  <text start="69.63" dur="3.9">it was a provocation by the u.s. to get</text>
  <text start="71.61" dur="3.54">the Chinese to do something and the</text>
  <text start="73.53" dur="3.42">Chinese actually came out and said it</text>
  <text start="75.15" dur="4.98">looked like the US are trying to provoke</text>
  <text start="76.95" dur="5.79">us what do we know in Africa well we</text>
  <text start="80.13" dur="4.62">understand that France is down in Malley</text>
  <text start="82.74" dur="4.68">and Central Africa they are moving their</text>
  <text start="84.75" dur="5.579">forces in why because they have a vast</text>
  <text start="87.42" dur="6.089">amount of natural resources gold uranium</text>
  <text start="90.329" dur="5.07">oil you name it they&amp;#39;re going to get it</text>
  <text start="93.509" dur="4.921">and this is what the central bankers do</text>
  <text start="95.399" dur="5.851">they move into the area the US has</text>
  <text start="98.43" dur="6">troops stationed in Italy for easy</text>
  <text start="101.25" dur="6.6">access into Africa and just a couple</text>
  <text start="104.43" dur="6.21">days ago the US was evacuating all the</text>
  <text start="107.85" dur="3.96">people in Sudan because of the uprising</text>
  <text start="110.64" dur="3.57">and the fighting was starting to</text>
  <text start="111.81" dur="5.099">intensify so they had to move the people</text>
  <text start="114.21" dur="5.64">out and here we are already with Obama</text>
  <text start="116.909" dur="5.731">saying that he might be moving military</text>
  <text start="119.85" dur="5.07">forces into Sudan and it&amp;#39;s not if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="122.64" dur="3.869">pretty much when because we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="124.92" dur="5.309">going to do it and why are they going to</text>
  <text start="126.509" dur="6.391">do it well the Chinese they are pumping</text>
  <text start="130.229" dur="5.461">in billions upon billions of dollars</text>
  <text start="132.9" dur="5.309">into Africa and they are setting up the</text>
  <text start="135.69" dur="4.53">infrastructure in Africa Kenya has</text>
  <text start="138.209" dur="4.531">become the clearinghouse for</text>
  <text start="140.22" dur="5.67">you one and all this is being taken</text>
  <text start="142.74" dur="5.85">place right now and this is the battle</text>

  <text start="150.93" dur="4.65">Korea the battle will be held in the</text>
  <text start="153.48" dur="5.04">Pacific and we can see how this is all</text>
  <text start="155.58" dur="6.15">coming together and forming at this time</text>
  <text start="158.52" dur="6.51">now let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="161.73" dur="6.06">news and we we&amp;#39;re going to go out to the</text>
  <text start="165.03" dur="5.46">UK right now now the UK youth</text>
  <text start="167.79" dur="4.29">unemployment is around twenty one</text>
  <text start="170.49" dur="4.02">percent and that&amp;#39;s nearly about 1</text>
  <text start="172.08" dur="4.44">million people and they&amp;#39;re having a very</text>
  <text start="174.51" dur="4.32">tough time their youth just like in</text>
  <text start="176.52" dur="4.62">every other country is having a tough</text>
  <text start="178.83" dur="4.59">time there&amp;#39;s just no jobs out there and</text>
  <text start="181.14" dur="5.01">this goes on to say that long-term</text>
  <text start="183.42" dur="7.5">unemployment is also rising the number</text>
  <text start="186.15" dur="7.26">of workers aged 18 to 24 that they are</text>
  <text start="190.92" dur="5.94">unemployed for over two years right now</text>
  <text start="193.41" dur="5.07">and it&amp;#39;s increasing current levels of</text>
  <text start="196.86" dur="4.77">youth unemployment are predicted to</text>
  <text start="198.48" dur="5.67">cause widespread poverty in old age as</text>
  <text start="201.63" dur="5.31">most youth can&amp;#39;t afford retirement</text>
  <text start="204.15" dur="4.5">savings and I see this happening here in</text>
  <text start="206.94" dur="3.93">the US it&amp;#39;s happening at Cypress that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="208.65" dur="4.41">happening in Greece it&amp;#39;s happening in</text>
  <text start="210.87" dur="4.649">Spain it&amp;#39;s happening in France is</text>
  <text start="213.06" dur="5.94">happening in Portugal and it goes on and</text>
  <text start="215.519" dur="6.601">on and on even in Germany where they are</text>
  <text start="219" dur="6.39">that they are also having the same</text>
  <text start="222.12" dur="6.54">problems because this is a wide spread</text>
  <text start="225.39" dur="5.76">problem the central bank is completely</text>
  <text start="228.66" dur="4.859">collapsing the private western central</text>
  <text start="231.15" dur="4.74">bank is collapsing and we&amp;#39;re seeing this</text>
  <text start="233.519" dur="5.401">spread all across Europe and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="235.89" dur="5.04">already here in the US but they all the</text>
  <text start="238.92" dur="5.069">numbers are manipulated and there is an</text>
  <text start="240.93" dur="4.98">illusion that they&amp;#39;ve painted where</text>
  <text start="243.989" dur="5.551">people believe that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="245.91" dur="6.03">where it is not and we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="249.54" dur="4.89">now in Cyprus they&amp;#39;re still under</text>
  <text start="251.94" dur="4.859">capital controls at this point but the</text>
  <text start="254.43" dur="5.46">IMF was out there saying that Cyprus is</text>
  <text start="256.799" dur="6.18">completely on track everything seems</text>
  <text start="259.89" dur="6.38">fine but paying down the debt may hamper</text>
  <text start="262.979" dur="5.581">growth for maybe a decade or so and</text>
  <text start="266.27" dur="6.04">what&amp;#39;s happening in Cyprus they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="268.56" dur="6.36">headed down the same path as Greece</text>
  <text start="272.31" dur="4.68">we have to remember back to when Greece</text>
  <text start="274.92" dur="4.56">got their first bailout and of course</text>
  <text start="276.99" dur="4.41">Cyprus had a bailout and a bail-in and</text>
  <text start="279.48" dur="5.27">capital controls where people couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="281.4" dur="6.99">can&amp;#39;t still get their money out and I</text>
  <text start="284.75" dur="7.96">mean right now in Cyprus they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="288.39" dur="8.85">at six 16.2 percent unemployment right</text>
  <text start="292.71" dur="6.75">now and it is increased by 0.7% and we</text>
  <text start="297.24" dur="4.58">have to just step back and look at</text>
  <text start="299.46" dur="8.55">Greece right now what&amp;#39;s been happening</text>
  <text start="301.82" dur="8.32">when Greece first got its bailout the</text>
  <text start="308.01" dur="4.92">news was out there and they reported</text>
  <text start="310.14" dur="4.83">something like this We strongly support</text>
  <text start="312.93" dur="4.5">the economic program announced today by</text>
  <text start="314.97" dur="4.62">the government of Greece the steps being</text>
  <text start="317.43" dur="4.71">taken well difficult are necessary to</text>
  <text start="319.59" dur="4.38">restore confidence in the Greek economy</text>
  <text start="322.14" dur="3.69">and to secure a better future for the</text>
  <text start="323.97" dur="3.36">Greek people the program is</text>
  <text start="325.83" dur="3.84">unprecedented in the scope of the</text>
  <text start="327.33" dur="5.04">national effort required as well as in</text>
  <text start="329.67" dur="4.95">the scale of the financial support there</text>
  <text start="332.37" dur="4.02">there&amp;#39;s about a hundred and ten billion</text>
  <text start="334.62" dur="5.52">euro being provided by the euro area</text>
  <text start="336.39" dur="8.16">countries and IMF we are confident that</text>
  <text start="340.14" dur="6.57">Greece will rise to the challenge and at</text>
  <text start="344.55" dur="4.29">the time that this was made in the</text>
  <text start="346.71" dur="5.91">headlines we saw hopes for greek debt</text>
  <text start="348.84" dur="7.26">progress lift world stocks and what we</text>
  <text start="352.62" dur="6.12">saw from that point on was nothing like</text>
  <text start="356.1" dur="6.72">they said everything was declining</text>
  <text start="358.74" dur="7.44">degrading completely falling apart they</text>
  <text start="362.82" dur="6.54">needed one bailout to bail out three</text>
  <text start="366.18" dur="6.11">bailout and you know since this time</text>
  <text start="369.36" dur="5.49">Greek salaries and the public sector</text>
  <text start="372.29" dur="5.23">have been cut up to about fifty percent</text>
  <text start="374.85" dur="4.59">wages in the private sector have been</text>
  <text start="377.52" dur="4.05">reduced by forty percent and Pensions</text>
  <text start="379.44" dur="5.79">have been cut up to forty-five percent</text>
  <text start="381.57" dur="5.55">from twenty ten to twenty thirteen the</text>
  <text start="385.23" dur="4.11">tax on the average income is increased</text>
  <text start="387.12" dur="4.29">by twenty five percent while the income</text>
  <text start="389.34" dur="4.59">of most people has gone up by over</text>
  <text start="391.41" dur="4.86">twenty nine percent taxation of real</text>
  <text start="393.93" dur="4.95">estate has increased by five hundred and</text>
  <text start="396.27" dur="5.19">fifty two percent the value-added tax</text>
  <text start="398.88" dur="5.76">was raised from 19 to 23 percent and</text>
  <text start="401.46" dur="4.05">numerous other indirect taxes have been</text>
  <text start="404.64" dur="4.08">added or</text>
  <text start="405.51" dur="5.15">gone up in 2014 revenue from tax</text>
  <text start="408.72" dur="5.28">increases imposed on businesses is</text>
  <text start="410.66" dur="4.96">expected is it is expected to increase</text>
  <text start="414" dur="5.01">by a hundred and thirty-seven point two</text>
  <text start="415.62" dur="7.02">percent so we can see what is happening</text>
  <text start="419.01" dur="5.91">in Greece it&amp;#39;s going to happen in Cyprus</text>
  <text start="422.64" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s going to happen in France it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="424.92" dur="4.86">going to happen in Portugal it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="427.65" dur="4.44">to happen in Spain and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="429.78" dur="6.21">spread throughout Europe it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="432.09" dur="6.99">spread to Australia Canada and again us</text>
  <text start="435.99" dur="5.25">and they understand this they know that</text>
  <text start="439.08" dur="4.56">this is a huge huge problem they cannot</text>
  <text start="441.24" dur="4.59">control it at this point and this is why</text>
  <text start="443.64" dur="4.35">the central bankers are making a move</text>
  <text start="445.83" dur="4.41">into many different countries trying to</text>
  <text start="447.99" dur="5.34">get the natural resources trying to get</text>
  <text start="450.24" dur="5.49">these countries on the central banking</text>
  <text start="453.33" dur="4.95">system they tried with the Ukraine but</text>
  <text start="455.73" dur="6.6">failed because they need more and more</text>
  <text start="458.28" dur="8.22">countries to take on and sell their</text>
  <text start="462.33" dur="7.8">natural resources using either the euro</text>
  <text start="466.5" dur="6.12">or the US dollar and they need to spread</text>
  <text start="470.13" dur="4.71">the debt they need more people taking on</text>
  <text start="472.62" dur="6.6">debt and they need more of this currency</text>
  <text start="474.84" dur="7.5">in circulation now here in the US and</text>
  <text start="479.22" dur="4.98">I&amp;#39;ve said this before we&amp;#39;ve seen last</text>
  <text start="482.34" dur="3.96">year where unemployment was around eight</text>
  <text start="484.2" dur="4.89">seven point nine percent something like</text>
  <text start="486.3" dur="5.79">that now we see it down to seven percent</text>
  <text start="489.09" dur="5.13">so during the year of 2013 more and more</text>
  <text start="492.09" dur="3.18">people have been getting jobs right</text>
  <text start="494.22" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s what the government has been</text>
  <text start="495.27" dur="4.59">telling us so in our minds what should</text>
  <text start="498.12" dur="4.08">be happening well more people should be</text>
  <text start="499.86" dur="5.34">buying real estate more people should be</text>
  <text start="502.2" dur="4.5">buying cars and retail should be booming</text>
  <text start="505.2" dur="3.03">because more people have jobs more</text>
  <text start="506.7" dur="5.91">people have disposable income and</text>
  <text start="508.23" dur="6.48">everything should be perfect but we are</text>
  <text start="512.61" dur="4.739">here now in the Christmas season and</text>
  <text start="514.71" dur="5.28">there we reporting that the Christmas</text>
  <text start="517.349" dur="5.551">season isn&amp;#39;t going as well as they</text>
  <text start="519.99" dur="5.07">thought and right now US consumers shop</text>
  <text start="522.9" dur="5.4">less on the final weekend before</text>
  <text start="525.06" dur="5.4">Christmas despite deeper discounts the</text>
  <text start="528.3" dur="4.79">latest sign of how difficult the season</text>
  <text start="530.46" dur="5.97">this is turning out to be for retailers</text>
  <text start="533.09" dur="6.22">analytics firm retailnext estimated on</text>
  <text start="536.43" dur="5.31">Sunday the US retail sales fell by</text>
  <text start="539.31" dur="4.14">a mid single-digit percentage at a</text>
  <text start="541.74" dur="4.56">brick-and-mortar stores on Friday and</text>
  <text start="543.45" dur="5.01">Saturday two of the four most important</text>
  <text start="546.3" dur="4.89">shopping days of the season compared</text>
  <text start="548.46" dur="6.18">with the same days last year now I ask</text>
  <text start="551.19" dur="5.04">you how can this be if unemployment is</text>
  <text start="554.64" dur="3.81">down and more people are working there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="556.23" dur="5.37">millions of more people working now how</text>
  <text start="558.45" dur="5.12">can this be why because this is an</text>
  <text start="561.6" dur="6.96">illusion just like the illusion that</text>
  <text start="563.57" dur="7.33">when December 28th hits and these people</text>
  <text start="568.56" dur="4.44">1.3 million people fall off the</text>
  <text start="570.9" dur="4.98">unemployment extended unemployment</text>
  <text start="573" dur="5.91">insurance they will no longer be counted</text>
  <text start="575.88" dur="5.28">as unemployed but as we know they are</text>
  <text start="578.91" dur="4.2">still unemployed they&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="581.16" dur="4.619">receiving the benefits they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="583.11" dur="5.58">counted so the unemployment rate goes</text>
  <text start="585.779" dur="5.31">down from seven to about what 6.2</text>
  <text start="588.69" dur="5.16">percent because I think JP Morgan one of</text>
  <text start="591.089" dur="4.921">the analysts said if they don&amp;#39;t extend</text>
  <text start="593.85" dur="3.51">the unemployment the unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="596.01" dur="3.06">is going to drop around point eight</text>
  <text start="597.36" dur="3.39">percent or so so that&amp;#39;s going to bring</text>
  <text start="599.07" dur="4.17">us to about six point two percent or</text>
  <text start="600.75" dur="6.78">something like that perfect perfect</text>
  <text start="603.24" dur="6.72">perfect for the Fed to do full-on taper</text>
  <text start="607.53" dur="5.04">which is never going to happen because</text>
  <text start="609.96" dur="5.52">we&amp;#39;re going to see some type of an event</text>
  <text start="612.57" dur="5.88">that stops everything in its tracks and</text>
  <text start="615.48" dur="6.3">all of a sudden the Fed the Federal</text>
  <text start="618.45" dur="8.46">Reserve will need to increase QE and</text>
  <text start="621.78" dur="8.19">really push it into overdrive now we</text>
  <text start="626.91" dur="5.67">understand that target had a problem</text>
  <text start="629.97" dur="5.22">they had their credit card system</text>
  <text start="632.58" dur="5.97">breached and they were stolen and it was</text>
  <text start="635.19" dur="5.82">millions of people and targets sales now</text>
  <text start="638.55" dur="5.94">over the weekend have slipped a three to</text>
  <text start="641.01" dur="5.699">four percent compared with last year and</text>
  <text start="644.49" dur="4.83">we can see how this is all starting to</text>
  <text start="646.709" dur="4.471">play out now I don&amp;#39;t know if this was</text>
  <text start="649.32" dur="4.92">done on purpose which it probably was</text>
  <text start="651.18" dur="5.19">but they the powers-that-be already knew</text>
  <text start="654.24" dur="4.77">that this crease this Christmas season</text>
  <text start="656.37" dur="5.52">was not going to go well they understood</text>
  <text start="659.01" dur="4.829">that this is a complete illusion the</text>
  <text start="661.89" dur="6">government knows this the Fed knows this</text>
  <text start="663.839" dur="7.5">and the only way to cover this up is to</text>
  <text start="667.89" dur="5.07">create an incident an event where they</text>
  <text start="671.339" dur="4.471">can blame this now they really</text>
  <text start="672.96" dur="4.44">can&amp;#39;t blame it on weather because we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="675.81" dur="4.23">been having you know the weather&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="677.4" dur="4.71">okay so they&amp;#39;re gonna have to push that</text>
  <text start="680.04" dur="4.92">aside so what they did was they created</text>
  <text start="682.11" dur="4.71">this event where target was hit with</text>
