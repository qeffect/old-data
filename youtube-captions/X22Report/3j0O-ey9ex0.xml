  <text start="99.12" dur="6.85">manufacturing showing that the economy</text>
  <text start="102.67" dur="7.05">is doing fantastically this is all part</text>
  <text start="105.97" dur="6.87">of the plan this is part of the plan to</text>
  <text start="109.72" dur="5.91">make the mainstream media to make the</text>
  <text start="112.84" dur="6.36">deep state completely confused and make</text>
  <text start="115.63" dur="6.48">it so they cannot attack Trump his</text>
  <text start="119.2" dur="5.01">administration and it will allow them to</text>
  <text start="122.11" dur="4.38">do what needs to be done in the</text>
  <text start="124.21" dur="6.139">background setting up the entire</text>
  <text start="126.49" dur="7.109">narrative for this incredible transition</text>
  <text start="130.349" dur="5.651">now we know that the payroll numbers</text>
  <text start="133.599" dur="5.791">they&amp;#39;re completely manipulated the bit</text>
  <text start="136" dur="4.98">the BLS numbers ADP numbers all these</text>
  <text start="139.39" dur="2.94">numbers that are coming out have been</text>
  <text start="140.98" dur="2.759">manipulated since the very beginning</text>
  <text start="142.33" dur="5.219">actually nothing has really changed</text>
  <text start="143.739" dur="6.541">since the manipulation Trump has just</text>
  <text start="147.549" dur="5.701">continued with what has been done before</text>
  <text start="150.28" dur="5.159">and actually has taken it and manipulate</text>
  <text start="153.25" dur="3.989">it a little bit more why because you</text>
  <text start="155.439" dur="3.901">wanted to show the economy doing</text>
  <text start="157.239" dur="3.931">fantastically now we have the numbers</text>
  <text start="159.34" dur="4.44">out and they&amp;#39;re telling us that wages</text>
  <text start="161.17" dur="5.14">are starting to rise</text>
  <text start="163.78" dur="5.38">employers are starting to hire more</text>
  <text start="166.31" dur="4.74">people are getting jobs and we need to</text>
  <text start="169.16" dur="4.65">remember something very very important</text>
  <text start="171.05" dur="5.22">it&amp;#39;s very easy to manipulate these</text>
  <text start="173.81" dur="5.28">numbers and if we look back in time</text>
  <text start="176.27" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;ve seen this time and time again when</text>
  <text start="179.09" dur="3.18">the unemployment numbers reach a certain</text>
  <text start="180.86" dur="2.73">point and they&amp;#39;re very very low right</text>
  <text start="182.27" dur="3.03">now three point seven percent this</text>
  <text start="183.59" dur="4.44">brings us all the way back to nineteen</text>
  <text start="185.3" dur="6.06">sixty-nine whenever this happens in a</text>
  <text start="188.03" dur="5.85">central bank system we enter a recession</text>
  <text start="191.36" dur="3.66">and if you look back in time and you</text>
  <text start="193.88" dur="2.73">look at all the different recessions</text>
  <text start="195.02" dur="3.84">from the 70s all the way up to the</text>
  <text start="196.61" dur="4.98">present day we&amp;#39;ve hit every session</text>
  <text start="198.86" dur="4.83">every time unemployment has dropped this</text>
  <text start="201.59" dur="4.92">is how the central banking system works</text>
  <text start="203.69" dur="4.59">yes they can manipulate the data yes</text>
  <text start="206.51" dur="3.9">they can push this as far as they can go</text>
  <text start="208.28" dur="5.01">but eventually what happens is</text>
  <text start="210.41" dur="4.92">everything will break down and Trump</text>
  <text start="213.29" dur="4.2">those people behind him they know this</text>
  <text start="215.33" dur="3.39">but they need to set the plan up before</text>
  <text start="217.49" dur="2.85">they allow this to happen</text>
  <text start="218.72" dur="3.09">they need to show that the economy is</text>
  <text start="220.34" dur="3.99">doing fantastically they need to</text>
  <text start="221.81" dur="5.22">continually mention it and let everyone</text>
  <text start="224.33" dur="5.22">know that look how great the employment</text>
  <text start="227.03" dur="4.74">of the United States is look how great</text>
  <text start="229.55" dur="4.8">manufacturing is look and many jobs are</text>
  <text start="231.77" dur="3.6">coming back this will stop the</text>
  <text start="234.35" dur="3.45">mainstream media an they&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="235.37" dur="5.01">very difficult time trying to say that</text>
  <text start="237.8" dur="4.65">well is this Obama&amp;#39;s economy is this</text>
  <text start="240.38" dur="4.32">Trump&amp;#39;s economy they will never come out</text>
  <text start="242.45" dur="4.29">and tell you that this is manipulated</text>
  <text start="244.7" dur="2.88">because it will fall back on Obama and</text>
  <text start="246.74" dur="2.7">the rest of the people and the</text>
  <text start="247.58" dur="4.11">mainstream media and the central bank</text>
  <text start="249.44" dur="4.35">for going along with this the entire</text>
  <text start="251.69" dur="4.14">time and they&amp;#39;re trying to counter that</text>
  <text start="253.79" dur="4.59">this whole entire thing but it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="255.83" dur="4.56">very difficult and they can&amp;#39;t do it and</text>
  <text start="258.38" dur="4.14">if you look at like the u.s. labor force</text>
  <text start="260.39" dur="3.99">participation rate we&amp;#39;ve hit an all-time</text>
  <text start="262.52" dur="3.42">low of like sixty two point seven it</text>
  <text start="264.38" dur="4.32">went up a little bit to sixty two point</text>
  <text start="265.94" dur="5.97">nine but if you really look at it we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="268.7" dur="6.15">been stagnant flatlined really hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="271.91" dur="5.82">moved much it hasn&amp;#39;t shot up or anything</text>
  <text start="274.85" dur="5.64">like that because what Trump and those</text>
  <text start="277.73" dur="6.24">behind them are doing they&amp;#39;re keeping</text>
  <text start="280.49" dur="6.14">everything status quo yes the statistics</text>
  <text start="283.97" dur="5.46">look great on paper it looks fantastic</text>
  <text start="286.63" dur="6.789">but in real life the entire economic</text>
  <text start="289.43" dur="6.66">system is falling apart and we can see</text>
  <text start="293.419" dur="3.301">this with what is happening on the</text>
  <text start="296.09" dur="2.49">streets</text>
  <text start="296.72" dur="3.36">what&amp;#39;s happening really in housing how</text>
  <text start="298.58" dur="4.05">the traffic is drying up</text>
  <text start="300.08" dur="6">how retail they&amp;#39;re closing up shops how</text>
  <text start="302.63" dur="5.85">retail sales are declining that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="306.08" dur="3.81">you know because the people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="308.48" dur="2.88">making the money and people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="309.89" dur="3.87">getting the jobs aren&amp;#39;t getting the high</text>
  <text start="311.36" dur="5.31">paying jobs they&amp;#39;re not going out and</text>
  <text start="313.76" dur="4.71">spending and that&amp;#39;s exactly what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="316.67" dur="5.01">seeing actually we see factory orders</text>
  <text start="318.47" dur="5.49">the growth has slowed in September and</text>
  <text start="321.68" dur="4.77">along these factory orders and a lot of</text>
  <text start="323.96" dur="3.54">this has been because of the wars that</text>
  <text start="326.45" dur="3.54">have been happening out in the Middle</text>
  <text start="327.5" dur="5.25">East this is why the United States has</text>
  <text start="329.99" dur="7.68">been producing but once these wars start</text>
  <text start="332.75" dur="6.81">to dwindle down once these wars end what</text>
  <text start="337.67" dur="3.96">happens to manufacturing what happens to</text>
  <text start="339.56" dur="4.53">the factory orders they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="341.63" dur="6.75">slide and we&amp;#39;re seeing the beginning</text>
  <text start="344.09" dur="6.75">stages of this now Trump knows this the</text>
  <text start="348.38" dur="5.16">Patriots behind them know this they know</text>
  <text start="350.84" dur="5.3">they can only keep this illusion alive</text>
  <text start="353.54" dur="4.89">for a certain period of time and</text>
  <text start="356.14" dur="4.15">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen as the</text>
  <text start="358.43" dur="4.71">value of the dollar decreases and as</text>
  <text start="360.29" dur="5.22">these countries take back control of</text>
  <text start="363.14" dur="4.26">their monetary system where they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="365.51" dur="4.17">want to sell their oil using the dollar</text>
  <text start="367.4" dur="4.23">anymore all these dollars are going to</text>
  <text start="369.68" dur="4.77">rush back to the United States and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="371.63" dur="4.47">talking about the central bank dollars</text>
  <text start="374.45" dur="3.99">the Federal Reserve notes that you have</text>
  <text start="376.1" dur="4.08">in your wallet those are gonna come back</text>
  <text start="378.44" dur="3.69">to United States a lot of it there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="380.18" dur="3.39">gonna be electronic but a lot of it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="382.13" dur="3.63">gonna come back to the United States and</text>
  <text start="383.57" dur="3.54">what this means is we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="385.76" dur="2.79">inflation now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="387.11" dur="2.67">where people saying well we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="388.55" dur="2.67">really seen inflation of course the</text>
  <text start="389.78" dur="2.79">central bankers out there saying wow</text>
  <text start="391.22" dur="3.36">we&amp;#39;re really trying to get inflation up</text>
  <text start="392.57" dur="4.26">well they really been tricking us</text>
  <text start="394.58" dur="4.29">because they&amp;#39;ve been pushing inflation</text>
  <text start="396.83" dur="5.1">into different areas like housing for</text>
  <text start="398.87" dur="6.54">one the stock market out of this country</text>
  <text start="401.93" dur="6.21">and even with products we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="405.41" dur="4.23">inflation but it was hidden from the</text>
  <text start="408.14" dur="3.56">public and we&amp;#39;ve talked about this</text>
  <text start="409.64" dur="4.29">before but for those people that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="411.7" dur="4.24">realize this or if never seen this</text>
  <text start="413.93" dur="4.02">before when you go to the grocery store</text>
  <text start="415.94" dur="4.08">and you look at some of the items a lot</text>
  <text start="417.95" dur="3.779">of the packaging what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="420.02" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re making the packages smaller and</text>
  <text start="421.729" dur="3.841">smaller and smaller they&amp;#39;re leaving out</text>
  <text start="423.71" dur="5.1">certain items or they&amp;#39;re using different</text>
  <text start="425.57" dur="5.48">ingredients one area that you can look</text>
  <text start="428.81" dur="5.54">is ice cream where you used to have</text>
  <text start="431.05" dur="4.92">a larger sized container they shrunk the</text>
  <text start="434.35" dur="3.48">container they made it look like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="435.97" dur="4.17">the same size but it&amp;#39;s actually smaller</text>
  <text start="437.83" dur="3.72">this is actually inflation because what</text>
  <text start="440.14" dur="1.74">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re trying to hide</text>
  <text start="441.55" dur="3.51">it</text>
  <text start="441.88" dur="5.04">by shrinking the packaging the same</text>
  <text start="445.06" dur="4.23">thing with like tuna and things like</text>
  <text start="446.92" dur="4.38">that most of the meat inside the fish</text>
  <text start="449.29" dur="3.78">meat that&amp;#39;s inside of the can is not</text>
  <text start="451.3" dur="3.72">really tuna and what they do is they</text>
  <text start="453.07" dur="3.72">swap things out but they&amp;#39;re getting to</text>
  <text start="455.02" dur="4.8">the point where they can&amp;#39;t do this</text>
  <text start="456.79" dur="5.46">anymore and we&amp;#39;re going to see certain</text>
  <text start="459.82" dur="4.59">products well they&amp;#39;re gonna be a little</text>
  <text start="462.25" dur="3.84">bit more expensive and this is not</text>
  <text start="464.41" dur="3.42">because the tariffs and all this this</text>
  <text start="466.09" dur="3.6">has been coming a long time now this is</text>
  <text start="467.83" dur="3.66">why we&amp;#39;ve been following this actually</text>
  <text start="469.69" dur="3.09">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at the different</text>
  <text start="471.49" dur="3.45">packaging actually people have been</text>
  <text start="472.78" dur="3.54">writing in for a very long time saying</text>
  <text start="474.94" dur="2.7">that oh this package is different that</text>
  <text start="476.32" dur="4.8">I&amp;#39;ll have the same number of crackers in</text>
  <text start="477.64" dur="5.13">this package this is inflation and now</text>
  <text start="481.12" dur="3.03">they&amp;#39;re kind of stuck because what do</text>
  <text start="482.77" dur="3.03">you do you design the package to go</text>
  <text start="484.15" dur="3.09">small and smaller until you have nothing</text>
  <text start="485.8" dur="3.27">no eventually what they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="487.24" dur="4.26">to do is they&amp;#39;re going to have to raise</text>
  <text start="489.07" dur="4.23">the prices Clorox is going to be raising</text>
  <text start="491.5" dur="5.1">the prices coca-cola is gonna be raising</text>
  <text start="493.3" dur="5.31">their prices we see many Manufacturing&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="496.6" dur="4.02">out there Delta JetBlue they met the</text>
  <text start="498.61" dur="3.03">airlines they don&amp;#39;t do a packaging</text>
  <text start="500.62" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re just gonna raise their costs</text>
  <text start="501.64" dur="5.58">there their prices on flights because of</text>
  <text start="504.01" dur="7.65">what jet fuel trucking same thing fuel</text>
  <text start="507.22" dur="7.05">moving up even Apple MacBook Air an iPad</text>
  <text start="511.66" dur="6.14">pro they&amp;#39;re gonna see an increase in</text>
  <text start="514.27" dur="6.78">prices and this is a long time coming</text>
  <text start="517.8" dur="6.36">we&amp;#39;re going to see everything get out of</text>
  <text start="521.05" dur="5.97">control again this is part of the plan</text>
  <text start="524.16" dur="5.02">to bring this system down I&amp;#39;ve said it</text>
  <text start="527.02" dur="5.28">many many times before we&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="529.18" dur="6.54">through a very bumpy road now there was</text>
  <text start="532.3" dur="6.6">a new poll that was done this week and</text>
  <text start="535.72" dur="5.82">it showed that 70% of US firms operating</text>
  <text start="538.9" dur="5.1">in southern China they&amp;#39;re considering</text>
  <text start="541.54" dur="6.24">delaying further investment in the</text>
  <text start="544" dur="6.54">country again this is part of the plan</text>
  <text start="547.78" dur="3.87">this is step one of the plan to get</text>
  <text start="550.54" dur="3.15">these countries to say you know</text>
  <text start="551.65" dur="4.56">something maybe we shouldn&amp;#39;t be here our</text>
  <text start="553.69" dur="5.28">secrets are being you know stolen</text>
  <text start="556.21" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re being sold off we&amp;#39;re being spied</text>
  <text start="558.97" dur="5.25">upon and maybe this is not</text>
  <text start="561.31" dur="3.18">cost-effective now are these companies</text>
  <text start="564.22" dur="1.679">going</text>
  <text start="564.49" dur="4.289">come directly back to the United States</text>
  <text start="565.899" dur="4.861">right away no that&amp;#39;s the second part of</text>
  <text start="568.779" dur="3.511">the plan the first part of the plan is</text>
  <text start="570.76" dur="3.21">to show companies why you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="572.29" dur="2.88">shouldn&amp;#39;t be in there now of course what</text>
  <text start="573.97" dur="2.85">companies are gonna do is gonna say well</text>
  <text start="575.17" dur="3.66">let&amp;#39;s look at different countries and</text>
  <text start="576.82" dur="5.04">maybe we can move our base of operation</text>
  <text start="578.83" dur="5.91">and this is what countries are starting</text>
  <text start="581.86" dur="6.3">to do the second part of the plan is to</text>

  <text start="589.93" dur="6.06">worthwhile for them to come back this is</text>
  <text start="592.45" dur="6.54">the second part of the plan the first is</text>
  <text start="595.99" dur="4.349">to impose tariffs to MIT to show these</text>
  <text start="598.99" dur="3.56">companies that they&amp;#39;re being spied upon</text>

  <text start="616.27" dur="4.02">were put into place in the United States</text>
  <text start="618.1" dur="4.41">was to get rid of the manufacturing</text>
  <text start="620.29" dur="3.989">remember the deep state they wanted all</text>
  <text start="622.51" dur="3.6">manufacturing out of the United States</text>
  <text start="624.279" dur="3.391">how do you do this you make it very</text>
  <text start="626.11" dur="3.3">difficult to survive here you make it</text>
  <text start="627.67" dur="4.53">said they don&amp;#39;t make a profit you make</text>
  <text start="629.41" dur="5.7">it so they can&amp;#39;t actually operate here</text>
  <text start="632.2" dur="6.72">now it all has to be reversed we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="635.11" dur="6">the beginning stages of this and as time</text>
  <text start="638.92" dur="5.159">goes on we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot more</text>
  <text start="641.11" dur="5.07">manufacturers come back once they see</text>
  <text start="644.079" dur="4.921">there&amp;#39;s deregulation once they see</text>
  <text start="646.18" dur="5.06">incentives once they see oh we can</text>
  <text start="649" dur="5.22">operate here we can make a profit here</text>
  <text start="651.24" dur="5.86">then and only then will companies start</text>
  <text start="654.22" dur="4.29">to come back to the United States and we</text>
  <text start="657.1" dur="4.53">can see that this is in the beginning</text>
  <text start="658.51" dur="5.91">stages remember everything that we see</text>
  <text start="661.63" dur="4.29">right now well it&amp;#39;s such a short period</text>
  <text start="664.42" dur="3.69">of time we have to remember that the</text>
  <text start="665.92" dur="4.62">deep state the central bankers have been</text>
  <text start="668.11" dur="3.96">planning this for many many years it</text>
  <text start="670.54" dur="3.359">didn&amp;#39;t take two years to get rid of all</text>
  <text start="672.07" dur="4.35">the manufacturers it took many many</text>
  <text start="673.899" dur="4.68">years and they did it in stealth mode so</text>
  <text start="676.42" dur="3.99">no one really realized it and no one</text>
  <text start="678.579" dur="4.531">really paid attention to it until it was</text>
  <text start="680.41" dur="5.16">too late now it all has to be undone</text>
  <text start="683.11" dur="5.729">because we&amp;#39;re headed towards this great</text>
  <text start="685.57" dur="5.16">collapse of the system and this is what</text>
  <text start="688.839" dur="6.69">is happening right now and it is a rush</text>
  <text start="690.73" dur="7.35">job we see that a lot of gold is being</text>
  <text start="695.529" dur="7.081">moved into</text>
  <text start="698.08" dur="6.96">China into Russia into India and many of</text>
  <text start="702.61" dur="5.19">the eastern countries and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="705.04" dur="6.6">seeing here is that United States is not</text>
  <text start="707.8" dur="7.65">taking on any new gold actually from the</text>
  <text start="711.64" dur="6.54">Switzerland the bank there we see</text>
  <text start="715.45" dur="4.95">Switzerland imported 92 tons of gold</text>
  <text start="718.18" dur="4.35">from the UK now we know of course that</text>
  <text start="720.4" dur="5.13">the UK is not a gold producing country</text>
  <text start="722.53" dur="5.28">so these are four hundred ounce bars</text>
  <text start="725.53" dur="5.07">from UK bullion banks that are bought</text>
  <text start="727.81" dur="4.8">that are bought by Swiss refiners to</text>
  <text start="730.6" dur="4.53">break down into one kilogram bars and</text>
  <text start="732.61" dur="4.8">shipped to China and India the majority</text>
  <text start="735.13" dur="5.37">of the 33 tons that came from the US and</text>
  <text start="737.41" dur="5.25">September is also 400 ounce bars from</text>
  <text start="740.5" dur="4.59">u.s. bullion banks most of the UK and US</text>
  <text start="742.66" dur="5.79">gold is likely to come from central</text>
  <text start="745.09" dur="5.55">banks remember the central banks do hold</text>
  <text start="748.45" dur="4.26">gold we don&amp;#39;t know how much they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="750.64" dur="3.84">holding they don&amp;#39;t allow us to audit</text>
  <text start="752.71" dur="6.45">them the gold in the United States</text>
  <text start="754.48" dur="8.13">hasn&amp;#39;t been audited since 1950 we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="759.16" dur="6.09">know if the 8100 tons are actually there</text>
  <text start="762.61" dur="4.38">most likely they&amp;#39;re not most likely it</text>
  <text start="765.25" dur="4.14">was leased out and they&amp;#39;ve been shipping</text>
  <text start="766.99" dur="5.19">at shipping the gold out this entire</text>
  <text start="769.39" dur="5.49">time this is why central bank all the</text>
  <text start="772.18" dur="5.07">banks have been telling us that gold is</text>
  <text start="774.88" dur="3.78">not important it&amp;#39;s not real money they</text>
  <text start="777.25" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t want people thinking about gold</text>
  <text start="778.66" dur="3.15">which means everyone should be thinking</text>
  <text start="781" dur="3.12">about gold</text>
  <text start="781.81" dur="5.55">everyone should be investing in gold</text>
  <text start="784.12" dur="5.19">everyone should have gold and everyone</text>
  <text start="787.36" dur="3.27">should have silver remember the central</text>
  <text start="789.31" dur="3.54">banks were out there telling you that</text>
  <text start="790.63" dur="4.44">hey criminals used crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="792.85" dur="2.64">terrorists use crypto currencies guess</text>
  <text start="795.07" dur="1.95">what</text>
  <text start="795.49" dur="4.23">you should have crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="797.02" dur="5.79">whatever the central bank says do the</text>
  <text start="799.72" dur="5.48">opposite if they tell you to hold all</text>
  <text start="802.81" dur="6.27">their Federal Reserve notes don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="805.2" dur="7.81">because as we can see over time gold has</text>
  <text start="809.08" dur="4.83">been around for thousands and thousands</text>
  <text start="813.01" dur="4.53">of years</text>
  <text start="813.91" dur="5.34">yes cryptocurrencies are new but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="817.54" dur="4.77">putting out a message which tells us</text>
  <text start="819.25" dur="5.25">they don&amp;#39;t want you to hold it and any</text>
  <text start="822.31" dur="5.01">time a central bank tells you that in my</text>
  <text start="824.5" dur="4.92">opinion I do the opposite I do the</text>
  <text start="827.32" dur="4.47">complete opposite maybe right now you</text>
  <text start="829.42" dur="4.17">don&amp;#39;t see the benefits but later on</text>
  <text start="831.79" dur="4.17">you will think about the Great</text>
  <text start="833.59" dur="3.84">Depression where the US government said</text>
  <text start="835.96" dur="5.34">listen we need your gold we&amp;#39;ll give you</text>
  <text start="837.43" dur="6.24">$20 per ounce for your gold and this</text>
  <text start="841.3" dur="3.77">will help the government well as soon as</text>
  <text start="843.67" dur="5.43">the government received all the gold</text>
  <text start="845.07" dur="5.38">they up the gold price to $35 now those</text>
  <text start="849.1" dur="3.6">people who said you know something I</text>
  <text start="850.45" dur="4.02">don&amp;#39;t want the paper I&amp;#39;m gonna hold on</text>
  <text start="852.7" dur="4.89">to the gold I&amp;#39;m gonna hide it I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="854.47" dur="5.36">keep it guess what happened they&amp;#39;re $20</text>
  <text start="857.59" dur="4.71">an ounce worth of gold that they had</text>
  <text start="859.83" dur="5.29">automatically went up to $35 an ounce</text>
  <text start="862.3" dur="6.15">and if at that time if they had 10</text>
  <text start="865.12" dur="3.78">ounces or 20 ounces or 5 ounces guess</text>
  <text start="868.45" dur="5.94">what</text>
  <text start="868.9" dur="7.32">they made out now we see the US and this</text>
  <text start="874.39" dur="4.86">is coming through Treasury secretary</text>
  <text start="876.22" dur="5.67">Steve minuchin they are placing</text>
  <text start="879.25" dur="5.85">sanctions on Iran but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="881.89" dur="5.94">interesting is they&amp;#39;re going to place</text>
  <text start="885.1" dur="4.92">sanctions on the finance the global</text>
  <text start="887.83" dur="5.01">financial messaging service which is</text>
  <text start="890.02" dur="6.96">Swift because what they want is they</text>
  <text start="892.84" dur="6.36">want Swift to disconnect from Iran now</text>
  <text start="896.98" dur="4.83">I&amp;#39;m not going to talk about the Iran</text>
  <text start="899.2" dur="6.36">sanctions and things like that what I am</text>
  <text start="901.81" dur="7.16">going to talk about is how they want to</text>
  <text start="905.56" dur="7.44">sanction Swift which is the central bank</text>
  <text start="908.97" dur="7.6">payment system if they don&amp;#39;t disconnect</text>
  <text start="913" dur="6.15">from Iran and listen to what minutia n--</text>
  <text start="916.57" dur="6.98">says and I know venusian is a goldman</text>
  <text start="919.15" dur="8.82">boy but the message is very interesting</text>
  <text start="923.55" dur="7.51">manoosh in&amp;#39; said we advised swift that</text>
  <text start="927.97" dur="6.09">it must disconnect any Iranian financial</text>
  <text start="931.06" dur="5.34">institution that we designate as soon as</text>
  <text start="934.06" dur="6.48">technologically feasible to avoid</text>
  <text start="936.4" dur="7.44">sanction exposure and minutiae went on</text>
  <text start="940.54" dur="7.83">to say Swift is no different than any</text>
  <text start="943.84" dur="9.84">other entity which means the Trump</text>
  <text start="948.37" dur="10.5">administration is not afraid to go ahead</text>
  <text start="953.68" dur="5.91">and sanction the central bank I mean</text>
  <text start="958.87" dur="4.45">think about it</text>
  <text start="959.59" dur="8.53">what other president would sank</text>
  <text start="963.32" dur="8.52">and swift never they would never do this</text>
  <text start="968.12" dur="6.81">what other president would contradict</text>
  <text start="971.84" dur="5.85">the Federal Reserve well Reagan has done</text>
  <text start="974.93" dur="6.06">this once before but he was shot</text>
  <text start="977.69" dur="4.53">we know that Abraham Lincoln did he was</text>
  <text start="980.99" dur="3.96">assassinated</text>
  <text start="982.22" dur="5.88">we know Kennedy did he was assassinated</text>
  <text start="984.95" dur="5.09">we know Andrew Jackson did there was an</text>
  <text start="988.1" dur="5.78">attempt of an assassination</text>
  <text start="990.04" dur="6.91">so Trump is out there and he is</text>
  <text start="993.88" dur="7.92">contradicting getting ready not afraid</text>
  <text start="996.95" dur="9.33">to sanction the central bank systems</text>
  <text start="1001.8" dur="9.1">this means that he&amp;#39;s not afraid to bring</text>
  <text start="1006.28" dur="7.62">down the central bank itself and it</text>
  <text start="1010.9" dur="5.49">what&amp;#39;s very funny is that Trump put out</text>
  <text start="1013.9" dur="4.95">a tweet today and it looks like the game</text>
  <text start="1016.39" dur="5.37">of thrones where it says sanctions are</text>
  <text start="1018.85" dur="4.83">coming November 5th and most likely this</text>
  <text start="1021.76" dur="5.61">is for Iran and things like that but</text>
  <text start="1023.68" dur="6.09">again if Swift doesn&amp;#39;t do what they want</text>
  <text start="1027.37" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re not afraid to sanction them</text>
  <text start="1029.77" dur="4.02">which is very telling</text>
