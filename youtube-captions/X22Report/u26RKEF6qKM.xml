  <text start="179.29" dur="4.949">completely changed and we do have proof</text>
  <text start="181.18" dur="5.57">of this we see that retail as we know</text>
  <text start="184.239" dur="5.191">well that&amp;#39;s continually declining</text>
  <text start="186.75" dur="5.14">restaurant traffic continually declining</text>

  <text start="194.62" dur="4.89">part of the country no it&amp;#39;s happening in</text>
  <text start="197.47" dur="5.49">many parts of the country some parts</text>
  <text start="199.51" dur="6.42">still see a big surge in the economy and</text>
  <text start="202.96" dur="4.92">you have to remember in those areas most</text>
  <text start="205.93" dur="4.86">of the time it&amp;#39;s because of foreigners</text>
  <text start="207.88" dur="5.49">coming into this country whether buying</text>
  <text start="210.79" dur="4.74">a lot of the speculative real estate</text>
  <text start="213.37" dur="4.65">where they are staying in the hotels</text>
  <text start="215.53" dur="4.74">where they are eating out and buying</text>
  <text start="218.02" dur="4.32">goods but if you move to other parts of</text>
  <text start="220.27" dur="4.95">the country where you don&amp;#39;t have this</text>
  <text start="222.34" dur="4.89">influx of foreign individuals you do not</text>
  <text start="225.22" dur="4.23">see it because the everyday American</text>
  <text start="227.23" dur="4.38">person well they&amp;#39;re pretty much tapped</text>
  <text start="229.45" dur="3.57">out today and from many different</text>
  <text start="231.61" dur="4.29">surveys that are out there we can see</text>
  <text start="233.02" dur="5.12">that this is absolutely true and nearly</text>
  <text start="235.9" dur="5.49">eight years into this economic recovery</text>
  <text start="238.14" dur="5.92">nearly half of Americans didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="241.39" dur="4.89">enough cash available to cover a four</text>
  <text start="244.06" dur="4.32">hundred dollar emergency now we&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="246.28" dur="3.78">this quite a bit where people are saying</text>
  <text start="248.38" dur="4.7">that yet we just do not have cash if</text>
  <text start="250.06" dur="5.7">something comes up that&amp;#39;s it and</text>
  <text start="253.08" dur="4.899">specifically this survey found out that</text>
  <text start="255.76" dur="4.5">in line with what the Fed has disclosed</text>
  <text start="257.979" dur="4.681">in previous years 44% of respondents</text>
  <text start="260.26" dur="5.43">said they wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to cover in</text>
  <text start="262.66" dur="6.09">an unexpected expense like a car repair</text>
  <text start="265.69" dur="5.7">or a medical bill or they would have to</text>
  <text start="268.75" dur="6.33">borrow money or sell something to meet</text>
  <text start="271.39" dur="5.67">this unexpected emergency actually when</text>
  <text start="275.08" dur="3.93">looking at this survey and if there was</text>
  <text start="277.06" dur="4.56">some type of an emergency that came up</text>
  <text start="279.01" dur="5.25">many of the people about 45% said they</text>
  <text start="281.62" dur="5.01">would go further into debt and use their</text>
  <text start="284.26" dur="4.95">credit cards just to get by</text>
  <text start="286.63" dur="4.47">27% said well I would have to go to my</text>
  <text start="289.21" dur="4.38">family or my friends and borrow the</text>
  <text start="291.1" dur="4.44">money so I can meet that expense and</text>
  <text start="293.59" dur="4.139">this is what&amp;#39;s happening in the country</text>
  <text start="295.54" dur="4.89">and when you hear these statistics and</text>
  <text start="297.729" dur="5.491">you hear what everyone is saying you</text>
  <text start="300.43" dur="4.83">then take that and you look at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="303.22" dur="3.81">happening in retail you take that and</text>
  <text start="305.26" dur="4.23">you see what&amp;#39;s happening in real estate</text>
  <text start="307.03" dur="4.08">and then you start to get a picture of</text>
  <text start="309.49" dur="3.51">what&amp;#39;s really going on remember when</text>
  <text start="311.11" dur="2.76">credit Swiss was out there and they were</text>
  <text start="313" dur="2.31">saying there&amp;#39;s going to be about</text>
  <text start="313.87" dur="2.52">something like six thousand eight</text>
  <text start="315.31" dur="2.64">thousand stores that we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="316.39" dur="3.29">close this year they said we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="317.95" dur="2.9">hit about 50 50 more</text>
  <text start="319.68" dur="3.239">words that are going to be declaring</text>
  <text start="320.85" dur="5.689">bankruptcy what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="322.919" dur="6.691">is that this is actually coming true and</text>
  <text start="326.539" dur="5.681">the other problem as we know is there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="329.61" dur="5.429">going to be a lot of retail space on the</text>
  <text start="332.22" dur="4.02">market now when we look at this there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="335.039" dur="3.901">going to be about a hundred and forty</text>
  <text start="336.24" dur="6.269">seven million square feet or just over</text>
  <text start="338.94" dur="6.479">five square miles of retail space and</text>
  <text start="342.509" dur="4.851">this is going to surpass the historical</text>
  <text start="345.419" dur="5.97">peak of a hundred and fifteen million in</text>
  <text start="347.36" dur="6.16">2001 and we know already that there&amp;#39;s at</text>
  <text start="351.389" dur="3.9">least ten retailers that have declared</text>
  <text start="353.52" dur="4.739">bankruptcy I mean pay less the limited</text>
  <text start="355.289" dur="5.551">RadioShack BCBG Wet Seal Gorman&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="358.259" dur="5.34">Eastern Outfitters Gander Mountain and</text>
  <text start="360.84" dur="5.25">there are many more to come and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="363.599" dur="4.981">happening is the list that Fitch has</text>
  <text start="366.09" dur="4.47">that list continually gets bigger and</text>
  <text start="368.58" dur="5.339">bigger and bigger why is this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="370.56" dur="5.94">because the everyday person cannot go</text>
  <text start="373.919" dur="4.771">out and purchase retail no they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="376.5" dur="3.72">going to online and saying oh instead of</text>
  <text start="378.69" dur="3.93">me driving to the store I&amp;#39;m just going</text>
  <text start="380.22" dur="4.919">to purchase this online that is not true</text>
  <text start="382.62" dur="5.16">online sales only makes up 8% of total</text>
  <text start="385.139" dur="5.701">retail what is happening right now is</text>
  <text start="387.78" dur="21.449">that everything got over expanded people</text>
  <text start="390.84" dur="21.6">have never have introduced to get by but</text>
  <text start="409.229" dur="5.851">by doing this they don&amp;#39;t have the funds</text>
  <text start="412.44" dur="5.61">to go out and purchase these homes to</text>
  <text start="415.08" dur="5.61">purchase goods to do anything like</text>
  <text start="418.05" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;ve done before so things are</text>
  <text start="420.69" dur="6.479">rapidly changing right now we actually</text>
  <text start="423.24" dur="7.169">see this on farms right now when it</text>
  <text start="427.169" dur="6">comes to agricultural debt the numbers</text>
  <text start="430.409" dur="5.63">aren&amp;#39;t as big as you know housing and</text>
  <text start="433.169" dur="6.81">student loans and things like that but</text>
  <text start="436.039" dur="7.66">what we see right now is how bad it is</text>
  <text start="439.979" dur="6.631">in the agricultural realm for farms and</text>
  <text start="443.699" dur="5.58">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that from</text>
  <text start="446.61" dur="5.73">the fourth quarter of 2014 to the first</text>
  <text start="449.279" dur="4.351">quarter of 2017 delinquencies have</text>
  <text start="452.34" dur="4.98">soared by 200</text>
  <text start="453.63" dur="5.16">and 25% to 1.4 billion and this is</text>
  <text start="457.32" dur="3.75">according to the board and governors of</text>
  <text start="458.79" dur="3.87">the Federal Reserve and it just released</text>
  <text start="461.07" dur="3.84">a report on this and saying that</text>
  <text start="462.66" dur="4.41">delinquencies in charge offs at all</text>
  <text start="464.91" dur="4.26">banks have just completely surged to the</text>
  <text start="467.07" dur="5.52">highest amount since the first quarter</text>
  <text start="469.17" dur="6.24">of 2011 and this tells us that it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="472.59" dur="6">just retail but this is another sector</text>
  <text start="475.41" dur="5.25">that is in trouble and what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="478.59" dur="4.65">is it is spreading across the country</text>
  <text start="480.66" dur="6.27">and it is just going to get worse and</text>
  <text start="483.24" dur="5.64">worse farmland values they&amp;#39;ve searched</text>
  <text start="486.93" dur="5.82">for the three decades but now are in</text>
  <text start="488.88" dur="5.81">decline in many parts of the US and in</text>
  <text start="492.75" dur="4.62">terms of loans associated with farmland</text>
  <text start="494.69" dur="5.14">delinquencies well they soared eighty</text>
  <text start="497.37" dur="5.4">percent from the third quarter of 2015</text>
  <text start="499.83" dur="6.6">to the first quarter of 2017 reaching</text>
  <text start="502.77" dur="7.14">two point fifteen billion dollars so</text>
  <text start="506.43" dur="4.68">what we&amp;#39;re seeing now is a breakdown not</text>
  <text start="509.91" dur="4.83">just in retail</text>
  <text start="511.11" dur="6.66">not just in manufacturing it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="514.74" dur="5.07">farmland agricultural we see it</text>
  <text start="517.77" dur="3.84">spreading across to many other</text>
  <text start="519.81" dur="6.15">industries in the United States and it</text>
  <text start="521.61" dur="5.76">is just getting worse and of course what</text>
  <text start="525.96" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re distracting</text>
  <text start="527.37" dur="4.11">everyone and making you look at the</text>
  <text start="529.47" dur="3.9">stock market look at the sp500 look at</text>
  <text start="531.48" dur="3.48">the Nasdaq look at the Dow everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="533.37" dur="3.87">going up everything should be fine and</text>
  <text start="534.96" dur="4.86">most of these companies are reporting</text>
  <text start="537.24" dur="5.25">that well we don&amp;#39;t see a positive future</text>
  <text start="539.82" dur="5.57">moving forward we see things actually</text>
  <text start="542.49" dur="7.53">breaking down now the SMP 500 is</text>
  <text start="545.39" dur="9.01">overvalued on 18 of the 20 valuation</text>
  <text start="550.02" dur="6.84">metrics but of course when you see the</text>
  <text start="554.4" dur="5.1">sp500 when you see the down when you see</text>
  <text start="556.86" dur="4.7">the Nasdaq there in the corporate media</text>
  <text start="559.5" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re just telling you how great it is</text>
  <text start="561.56" dur="5.89">how fantastic the economy&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="564.03" dur="6.57">because look how high the market is so</text>
  <text start="567.45" dur="4.71">why is the market so overvalued why are</text>
  <text start="570.6" dur="4.2">we seeing the same thing that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="572.16" dur="5.13">always seen because the central bankers</text>
  <text start="574.8" dur="5.82">have complete control over the market</text>
  <text start="577.29" dur="7.2">they manipulate it just like in 2015</text>
  <text start="580.62" dur="6.13">2016 nothing has changed in 2017 no</text>
  <text start="584.49" dur="4.75">matter how many events there are no mad</text>
  <text start="586.75" dur="3.93">or what happens in the world yes the</text>
  <text start="589.24" dur="3.03">market goes down a little bit then all</text>
  <text start="590.68" dur="4.65">of a sudden shoots right back up isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="592.27" dur="5.58">that amazing and the market continually</text>
  <text start="595.33" dur="5.04">moves up even when bad earnings come in</text>
  <text start="597.85" dur="5.61">even when companies say we don&amp;#39;t see any</text>
  <text start="600.37" dur="5.7">positive outlook in earnings and growth</text>
  <text start="603.46" dur="4.83">and sales even when there are retail</text>
  <text start="606.07" dur="6.18">stores that are closing down like crazy</text>
  <text start="608.29" dur="6.99">and they&amp;#39;re going bankrupt even when</text>
  <text start="612.25" dur="5.34">housing is declining orga Jap locations</text>
  <text start="615.28" dur="4.47">are declining it&amp;#39;s strange the market</text>
  <text start="617.59" dur="5.34">just continually moves up why is this</text>
  <text start="619.75" dur="5.31">because it&amp;#39;s all manipulated and when I</text>
  <text start="622.93" dur="4.53">be manipulated I mean all they do is</text>
  <text start="625.06" dur="4.65">push a button and it goes up they feed</text>
  <text start="627.46" dur="4.92">free money into the banks they dump it</text>
  <text start="629.71" dur="3.96">into the market they take the money back</text>
  <text start="632.38" dur="3.45">out they put it back in</text>
  <text start="633.67" dur="4.35">they keep manipulating the market any</text>
  <text start="635.83" dur="6.21">way they possibly can to keep this</text>
  <text start="638.02" dur="6.9">system going because what they want to</text>
  <text start="642.04" dur="4.05">do is they want to bring it down they</text>
  <text start="644.92" dur="3.36">want to make sure that they have</text>
  <text start="646.09" dur="4.44">everything set up they want to make sure</text>
  <text start="648.28" dur="5.19">they make as much profit as possible and</text>
  <text start="650.53" dur="5.01">make sure they destroy as many people as</text>
  <text start="653.47" dur="4.89">they possibly can because this is the</text>
  <text start="655.54" dur="5.19">wealth transfer this is what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
