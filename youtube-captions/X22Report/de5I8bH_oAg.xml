  <text start="577.87" dur="9.09">throw the carcass over the cliff all at</text>
  <text start="581.45" dur="7.4">once meanwhile behind all of this is</text>
  <text start="586.96" dur="6.91">gold</text>
  <text start="588.85" dur="8.28">China has gold Russia has gold and there</text>
  <text start="593.87" dur="6.93">is talk that Trump has recovered the</text>
  <text start="597.13" dur="5.44">gold here in the United States this is</text>
  <text start="600.8" dur="4.74">why they&amp;#39;re so confident this is why</text>
  <text start="602.57" dur="4.65">gold is creeping up yes you&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>

  <text start="610.09" dur="5.68">everyone would catch on everyone be</text>
  <text start="612.35" dur="5.94">heading towards gold it would be a</text>
  <text start="615.77" dur="5.07">disaster you need to bring it up slowly</text>
  <text start="618.29" dur="5.22">and make sure you have everything in</text>
  <text start="620.84" dur="6.51">place for this transition this</text>
  <text start="623.51" dur="7.89">transition into this new economic system</text>

  <text start="632.96" dur="6.51">happen everything is being prepped and</text>
  <text start="637.06" dur="6.16">everything is moving in that direction</text>
  <text start="639.47" dur="5.61">and this is why I&amp;#39;ve always said no</text>
  <text start="643.22" dur="3.42">matter if it was the deep state in power</text>
  <text start="645.08" dur="4.35">yes we would have a completely different</text>
  <text start="646.64" dur="4.02">scenario you would have to prepare you&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="649.43" dur="1.98">have to prepare for something completely</text>
  <text start="650.66" dur="3.42">different</text>
  <text start="651.41" dur="6.15">you would have to prepare for a collapse</text>
  <text start="654.08" dur="6.77">and a credit freeze and you would have</text>
  <text start="657.56" dur="6.15">you would go into survival mode this</text>
  <text start="660.85" dur="5.17">transition is different they&amp;#39;re setting</text>
  <text start="663.71" dur="5.94">up a sound money system which is running</text>
  <text start="666.02" dur="6.36">parallel to the central bank system this</text>
  <text start="669.65" dur="5.49">is why Trump is bringing in people to</text>
