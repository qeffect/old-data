  <text start="301.21" dur="3.39">we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot of these</text>
  <text start="303.01" dur="4.95">individuals most likely they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="304.6" dur="5.79">end up resigning one way or another now</text>
  <text start="307.96" dur="4.08">we know the fake impeachment is going to</text>
  <text start="310.39" dur="4.38">continue this week in the deep State as</text>
  <text start="312.04" dur="6.24">many disgruntled employees lined up and</text>
  <text start="314.77" dur="5.7">there might be some surprises that will</text>
  <text start="318.28" dur="4.86">shine a light on the truth because there</text>
  <text start="320.47" dur="3.69">are some individuals that said there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="323.14" dur="3.3">nothing there</text>
  <text start="324.16" dur="4.29">Trump didn&amp;#39;t do anything wrong now of</text>
  <text start="326.44" dur="4.14">course they&amp;#39;re gonna try to hold this</text>
  <text start="328.45" dur="4.32">back but the Republicans are gonna push</text>
  <text start="330.58" dur="2.85">to get this out and this all starts</text>
  <text start="332.77" dur="3.21">tomorrow</text>
  <text start="333.43" dur="4.56">once again and we&amp;#39;ll have to see how</text>
  <text start="335.98" dur="5.3">this all plays out but Trump tweeted out</text>
  <text start="337.99" dur="6.12">the following tell Jennifer Williams</text>
  <text start="341.28" dur="4.99">whoever that is to read both transcripts</text>
  <text start="344.11" dur="3.81">of the presidential calls and see the</text>
  <text start="346.27" dur="3.54">just-released statement from Ukraine</text>
  <text start="347.92" dur="4.23">then she should meet with the other</text>
  <text start="349.81" dur="5.04">never Trump errs who I don&amp;#39;t know and</text>
  <text start="352.15" dur="4.95">mostly never heard of and work out a</text>
  <text start="354.85" dur="5.04">better presidential attack now remember</text>
  <text start="357.1" dur="5.4">she was the one that had to change her</text>
  <text start="359.89" dur="4.8">statement because she said that Trump</text>
  <text start="362.5" dur="4.23">was the one who mentioned burry smih it</text>
  <text start="364.69" dur="4.53">was in Solinsky but then Trump released</text>
  <text start="366.73" dur="4.68">the call and she had to correct this</text>
  <text start="369.22" dur="4.23">because now the phone transcript book</text>
  <text start="371.41" dur="5.25">was released Trump did this on purpose</text>
  <text start="373.45" dur="5.16">to counter everything that everyone was</text>
  <text start="376.66" dur="3.99">saying and if you notice all these</text>
  <text start="378.61" dur="4.95">individuals who were saying all these</text>
  <text start="380.65" dur="5.82">things not just with the July 25th phone</text>
  <text start="383.56" dur="5.67">call but the previous phone call it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="386.47" dur="6.78">all turning out to be fake phony and</text>
  <text start="389.23" dur="6.24">false the deep state is continually</text>
  <text start="393.25" dur="4.67">trying to make it seem like Trump needs</text>
  <text start="395.47" dur="4.8">to prove that he is innocent</text>
  <text start="397.92" dur="4.9">Pelosi keeps going in front of the</text>
  <text start="400.27" dur="5.49">reporters pushing this angle it is</text>
  <text start="402.82" dur="5.61">actually the opposite the deep state has</text>
  <text start="405.76" dur="5.34">to prove he did something wrong she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="408.43" dur="5.06">pushing her angle because they cannot</text>
  <text start="411.1" dur="5.4">prove that he did something wrong so</text>
  <text start="413.49" dur="5.89">reversing it makes it easier for them</text>
  <text start="416.5" dur="4.38">and it makes it sound like oh yeah he</text>
  <text start="419.38" dur="4.59">must have done something wrong and he</text>
  <text start="420.88" dur="6.06">has to prove that he didn&amp;#39;t that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="423.97" dur="5.79">how the judicial system works this time</text>
  <text start="426.94" dur="7.07">America works that&amp;#39;s not how the</text>
  <text start="429.76" dur="8.16">Constitution was written it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="434.01" dur="6.54">you&amp;#39;re innocent until proven guilty</text>
  <text start="437.92" dur="5.37">so everything that Pelosi is saying is</text>
  <text start="440.55" dur="4.93">actually the opposite and this goes back</text>
  <text start="443.29" dur="6.12">to everything they normally say is</text>
  <text start="445.48" dur="7.94">always the opposite Trump tweeted out</text>
  <text start="449.41" dur="6.99">the following hour crazy do nothing in</text>
  <text start="453.42" dur="5.2">brackets where&amp;#39;s USMC a infrastructure</text>
  <text start="456.4" dur="5.16">lower drug prices and much more Speaker</text>
  <text start="458.62" dur="5.25">of the House nervous Nancy Pelosi is who</text>
  <text start="461.56" dur="4.77">is petrified by her radical left knowing</text>
  <text start="463.87" dur="4.8">she will soon be gone this is in</text>
  <text start="466.33" dur="5.88">parentheses they in fake news media are</text>
  <text start="468.67" dur="8.07">her boss suggested on Sundays to face</text>
  <text start="472.21" dur="6.9">the nation that I testify about the</text>
  <text start="476.74" dur="4.71">phony impeachment witch-hunt she also</text>
  <text start="479.11" dur="4.44">said I could do it in writing even</text>
  <text start="481.45" dur="4.62">though I did nothing wrong and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="483.55" dur="3.48">like giving credibility to this no due</text>
  <text start="486.07" dur="3.42">process hoax</text>
  <text start="487.03" dur="5.22">I like the idea and will in order to get</text>
  <text start="489.49" dur="6.06">Congress focused again strongly consider</text>
  <text start="492.25" dur="7.98">it now Trump right now is calling her</text>
  <text start="495.55" dur="6.54">out and he&amp;#39;s calling her Bluff because</text>
  <text start="500.23" dur="4.98">he really doesn&amp;#39;t have to do anything</text>
  <text start="502.09" dur="4.53">but he&amp;#39;s putting it out there just like</text>
  <text start="505.21" dur="3.72">he countered them with the phone</text>
  <text start="506.62" dur="5.19">transcript they never expected him to do</text>
  <text start="508.93" dur="5.549">this most likely they never expected him</text>
  <text start="511.81" dur="5.34">to say okay I might do this in writing</text>
  <text start="514.479" dur="4.801">now maybe he will maybe he won&amp;#39;t do I</text>
  <text start="517.15" dur="3.389">think he needs to know because I think</text>
  <text start="519.28" dur="4.02">the phone transcripts</text>
  <text start="520.539" dur="4.441">explain it all there&amp;#39;s nothing else to</text>
  <text start="523.3" dur="5.49">put out there and it would be very funny</text>
  <text start="524.98" dur="5.19">if he says okay here it is here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="528.79" dur="2.94">proof and he releases the phone</text>
  <text start="530.17" dur="4.32">transcripts and says here they are now</text>
  <text start="531.73" dur="5.73">the deep state they know they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="534.49" dur="6.3">anything this is why they can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="537.46" dur="5.88">anyone in front of the camera to say yes</text>
  <text start="540.79" dur="4.59">this is an impeachable offense yes this</text>
  <text start="543.34" dur="6.18">is the crime this is the portion they</text>
  <text start="545.38" dur="6.77">would actually take the portion and show</text>
  <text start="549.52" dur="5.04">it to America if they actually had it</text>
  <text start="552.15" dur="4.48">now if he never released the phone</text>
  <text start="554.56" dur="4.17">transcript this is what they&amp;#39;d be doing</text>
  <text start="556.63" dur="3.32">but since the phone transcript was</text>
  <text start="558.73" dur="3.77">released they</text>
  <text start="559.95" dur="5.16">can&amp;#39;t do it and they&amp;#39;re parading these</text>
  <text start="562.5" dur="5.55">people in front of the camera to put on</text>
  <text start="565.11" dur="6">a show that&amp;#39;s all they&amp;#39;re doing but the</text>
  <text start="568.05" dur="6.44">Patriots want them to do this it exposes</text>
