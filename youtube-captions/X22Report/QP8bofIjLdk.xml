  <text start="71.49" dur="4.44">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="73.29" dur="5.329">news now it seems the bankers the</text>
  <text start="75.93" dur="4.829">central bankers they are continually</text>
  <text start="78.619" dur="5.441">repeating their message about</text>
  <text start="80.759" dur="6.151">cryptocurrencies they are so afraid of</text>
  <text start="84.06" dur="5.97">cryptocurrencies where the people start</text>
  <text start="86.91" dur="5.37">to realize what it is now if we go back</text>
  <text start="90.03" dur="4.86">in time remember the internet where they</text>
  <text start="92.28" dur="4.08">said you know what is this this is not</text>
  <text start="94.89" dur="3.45">going to be used for anything what do</text>
  <text start="96.36" dur="3.84">you do with it and at that time when it</text>
  <text start="98.34" dur="5.01">was first being developed and people</text>
  <text start="100.2" dur="5.91">started to come online through AOL and</text>
  <text start="103.35" dur="4.95">then eventually through DSL then cable</text>
  <text start="106.11" dur="4.38">modems but in the early stages you</text>
  <text start="108.3" dur="3.929">couldn&amp;#39;t really buy anything you really</text>
  <text start="110.49" dur="4.71">couldn&amp;#39;t do anything you can search a</text>
  <text start="112.229" dur="5.67">couple things there was no search</text>
  <text start="115.2" dur="5.55">capabilities except for Yahoo which was</text>
  <text start="117.899" dur="4.921">the beginning stages of a search engine</text>
  <text start="120.75" dur="3.979">but it was a directory it didn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="122.82" dur="4.409">go out and search different sites to</text>
  <text start="124.729" dur="4.841">bring back the information you had to</text>
  <text start="127.229" dur="5.281">enter it manually and people didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="129.57" dur="4.259">realize what it was and people kind of</text>
  <text start="132.51" dur="3.63">looked at it and said I don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="133.829" dur="4.41">this is gonna be used for but today you</text>
  <text start="136.14" dur="3.78">could see that people have phones it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="138.239" dur="4.401">all connected to the Internet you can</text>
  <text start="139.92" dur="5.64">turn your lights on in your home from</text>
  <text start="142.64" dur="4.84">someplace else and this is all passing</text>
  <text start="145.56" dur="4.2">through the internet you can stream</text>
  <text start="147.48" dur="4.59">videos today I mean think about the</text>
  <text start="149.76" dur="4.77">things you can do today on the internet</text>
  <text start="152.07" dur="3.84">now with cryptocurrency the same thing</text>
  <text start="154.53" dur="3.69">that&amp;#39;s happening we&amp;#39;re in the beginning</text>
  <text start="155.91" dur="4.38">stages where yes in the beginning stages</text>
  <text start="158.22" dur="4.889">everyone was just getting into it there</text>
  <text start="160.29" dur="4.71">were speculation let&amp;#39;s get Bitcoin up</text>
  <text start="163.109" dur="3.69">there let&amp;#39;s invest in this it&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="165" dur="3.15">keep going up but eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="166.799" dur="4.171">going to happen and it&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="168.15" dur="6.03">already they&amp;#39;re developing all different</text>
  <text start="170.97" dur="6.329">types of apps that will go along with</text>
  <text start="174.18" dur="5.339">the blockchain and this is the very very</text>
  <text start="177.299" dur="4.651">early stages but the central bankers</text>
  <text start="179.519" dur="3.811">they&amp;#39;re out there in full force trying</text>
  <text start="181.95" dur="3.119">to keep people away and every time</text>
  <text start="183.33" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re trying to tell you something</text>
  <text start="185.069" dur="4.801">it&amp;#39;s always the</text>
  <text start="186.96" dur="6.06">it now the former CEO of Intuit said</text>
  <text start="189.87" dur="5.67">Bitcoin is the greatest scam in history</text>
  <text start="193.02" dur="5.85">and warned people not to fall for it</text>
  <text start="195.54" dur="5.94">it&amp;#39;s a colossal pump and dump scheme he</text>
  <text start="198.87" dur="4.62">said I&amp;#39;m tired of saying be careful it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="201.48" dur="3.99">speculative then be careful it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="203.49" dur="3.33">gambling then be careful it&amp;#39;s a bubble</text>
  <text start="205.47" dur="4.47">okay I&amp;#39;ll say it</text>
  <text start="206.82" dur="6.75">bitcoin is a scam he went on to say it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="209.94" dur="6.51">the job of the SEC and other regulators</text>
  <text start="213.57" dur="5.19">to protect ordinary investors from</text>
  <text start="216.45" dur="4.8">misleading and fraudulent schemes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="218.76" dur="5.82">time we gave them the legislative</text>
  <text start="221.25" dur="4.68">authority to do their job now it&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="224.58" dur="3.72">that they call this a pump and dump</text>
  <text start="225.93" dur="5.94">because if we look at the stock market</text>
  <text start="228.3" dur="6.75">and we go back in time how many times</text>
  <text start="231.87" dur="5.64">has the market been pumped up then</text>
  <text start="235.05" dur="4.77">dumped I mean think about this for a</text>
  <text start="237.51" dur="3.87">second this just shouldn&amp;#39;t happen once</text>
  <text start="239.82" dur="3.62">it just didn&amp;#39;t happen twice</text>
  <text start="241.38" dur="6.18">it happened many times now if I go back</text>
  <text start="243.44" dur="7.57">to around 1929 and we count there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="247.56" dur="6.81">about 18 times where the market was</text>
  <text start="251.01" dur="5.19">pumped up then dumped and this was a</text>
  <text start="254.37" dur="3.42">depression and recession each one of</text>
  <text start="256.2" dur="4.05">these times and we&amp;#39;re on I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="257.79" dur="4.68">the 19th time where they&amp;#39;ve been pumping</text>
  <text start="260.25" dur="3.96">it up and they&amp;#39;re going to dump it so if</text>
  <text start="262.47" dur="3.87">they want to talk about a pump and dump</text>
  <text start="264.21" dur="4.23">scheme they should be talking about the</text>
  <text start="266.34" dur="5.16">stock market and what the central banks</text>
  <text start="268.44" dur="5.37">are doing and they&amp;#39;re all doing this</text>
  <text start="271.5" dur="5.64">because they understand and they realize</text>
  <text start="273.81" dur="5.49">that crypto currencies is a completely</text>
  <text start="277.14" dur="4.38">different animal it&amp;#39;s not centralized</text>
  <text start="279.3" dur="4.14">actually centralization it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="281.52" dur="4.53">obsolete the central bank is completely</text>
  <text start="283.44" dur="5.67">obsolete and if we move in that</text>
  <text start="286.05" dur="5.13">direction guess what we don&amp;#39;t need the</text>
  <text start="289.11" dur="4.59">banks we don&amp;#39;t need the payment systems</text>
  <text start="291.18" dur="4.98">we don&amp;#39;t need what they setup this is</text>
  <text start="293.7" dur="4.83">what they&amp;#39;re so afraid of and this is</text>
  <text start="296.16" dur="5.67">why at every turn you&amp;#39;re gonna hear them</text>
  <text start="298.53" dur="6.21">say that this is a scam this is a bubble</text>
  <text start="301.83" dur="4.53">this is no good stay away from it I mean</text>
  <text start="304.74" dur="4.77">think about what they&amp;#39;ve told us in the</text>
  <text start="306.36" dur="4.8">past just go back to 2008 the central</text>
  <text start="309.51" dur="4.14">bankers told us that we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="311.16" dur="5.34">forecasting a recession these subprime</text>
  <text start="313.65" dur="5.73">securities which were regulated their</text>
  <text start="316.5" dur="3.66">triple-a they turned out to be complete</text>
  <text start="319.38" dur="3.06">and utter</text>
  <text start="320.16" dur="4.23">garbage so let&amp;#39;s think about what</text>
  <text start="322.44" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;ve been telling us in the past and</text>
  <text start="324.39" dur="4.65">this way we can make a decision on are</text>
  <text start="326.49" dur="4.77">they telling us the truth or do they</text>
  <text start="329.04" dur="5.04">have a motive behind the scenes and I</text>
  <text start="331.26" dur="5.67">think yes they have a motive they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="334.08" dur="5.7">want the people of the world to wake up</text>
  <text start="336.93" dur="5.46">and see something completely different a</text>
  <text start="339.78" dur="5.55">different system that does not include</text>
  <text start="342.39" dur="5.76">the central banks and again you just</text>
  <text start="345.33" dur="5.73">don&amp;#39;t push a button and Bitcoin appears</text>
  <text start="348.15" dur="6.69">it takes a lot of time a lot of</text>
  <text start="351.06" dur="5.58">processing to mine these coins just like</text>
  <text start="354.84" dur="5.4">gold and silver love them both</text>
  <text start="356.64" dur="6.66">you need equipment you need to hone in</text>
  <text start="360.24" dur="4.95">on the gold you need to extract it that</text>
  <text start="363.3" dur="3.84">is mining the same thing with crypto</text>
  <text start="365.19" dur="5.13">currencies it takes a very long time</text>
  <text start="367.14" dur="5.01">just to get one coin you don&amp;#39;t push a</text>
  <text start="370.32" dur="3.47">button and it appears right in front of</text>
  <text start="372.15" dur="3.87">you takes a lot of processing power</text>
  <text start="373.79" dur="4.24">compared to the central bank where they</text>
  <text start="376.02" dur="4.32">push a button and guess what the funny</text>
  <text start="378.03" dur="4.53">money is created in two seconds didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="380.34" dur="5.37">take any type of labor didn&amp;#39;t take any</text>
  <text start="382.56" dur="4.92">type of mining nothing there and you can</text>
  <text start="385.71" dur="3.84">see that they&amp;#39;re not going to give up</text>
  <text start="387.48" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re gonna continually push this now</text>
  <text start="389.55" dur="4.71">the central banker is they experimented</text>
  <text start="392.07" dur="4.26">with universal basic income and we</text>
  <text start="394.26" dur="4.35">talked about this many many times in the</text>
  <text start="396.33" dur="4.86">past and they set up an experiment in</text>
  <text start="398.61" dur="5.64">Finland and the government went ahead</text>
  <text start="401.19" dur="5.55">and said okay we will do a trial of</text>
  <text start="404.25" dur="4.77">universal basic income we will give each</text>
  <text start="406.74" dur="4.53">person and they did this test on about</text>
  <text start="409.02" dur="4.56">2,000 people six hundred and eighty-five</text>
  <text start="411.27" dur="4.11">dollars per month without requiring them</text>
  <text start="413.58" dur="4.19">to work or seek employment</text>
  <text start="415.38" dur="5.64">it was just given to them and after</text>
  <text start="417.77" dur="5.77">their trial a two-year trial the</text>
  <text start="421.02" dur="5.37">government rejected a request to extend</text>
  <text start="423.54" dur="4.65">the two-year trial program it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="426.39" dur="4.14">work you know what the people did they</text>
  <text start="428.19" dur="5.07">did absolutely nothing it didn&amp;#39;t help</text>
  <text start="430.53" dur="6.15">with unemployment didn&amp;#39;t help with</text>
  <text start="433.26" dur="6">purchasing didn&amp;#39;t help with anything and</text>
  <text start="436.68" dur="6">they realized this and the experiment</text>
  <text start="439.26" dur="5.43">failed the IMF is out there and they are</text>
  <text start="442.68" dur="4.35">saying listen the global financial</text>
  <text start="444.69" dur="4.77">system is at risk there&amp;#39;s too much debt</text>
  <text start="447.03" dur="3.9">credit leverage and we need to do</text>
  <text start="449.46" dur="4.04">something and actually when they say we</text>
  <text start="450.93" dur="5.69">it means the government they</text>
  <text start="453.5" dur="5.25">need to push austerity on the people and</text>
  <text start="456.62" dur="3.66">this&amp;#39;s that developed nations this is</text>
  <text start="458.75" dur="5.46">not the emerging markets this is the</text>
  <text start="460.28" dur="6.42">developed nations to us the UK Germany</text>
  <text start="464.21" dur="6.39">and the rest of the nations they want</text>
  <text start="466.7" dur="6.54">the government&amp;#39;s to cut and to cut and</text>
  <text start="470.6" dur="5.55">to cut and push austerity on the people</text>
  <text start="473.24" dur="4.8">because they want their system to be</text>
  <text start="476.15" dur="4.41">alive and kicking because if they</text>
  <text start="478.04" dur="4.14">continue on this path countries are</text>
  <text start="480.56" dur="3.96">going to start to default and then</text>
  <text start="482.18" dur="4.35">people are gonna point the finger at the</text>
  <text start="484.52" dur="4.14">central bank saying wait a minute you</text>
  <text start="486.53" dur="4.08">told us debt was good why are these</text>
  <text start="488.66" dur="5.25">countries defaulting right now why are</text>
  <text start="490.61" dur="5.55">they collapsing under the load of debt</text>
  <text start="493.91" dur="3.81">that you put them into and we can see</text>
  <text start="496.16" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re very nervous about this now if</text>
  <text start="497.72" dur="4.92">we look back in time and we look at all</text>
  <text start="500.36" dur="5.88">the major currencies and we go back to</text>
  <text start="502.64" dur="7.2">the 1900s and we look at the mark the</text>
  <text start="506.24" dur="5.58">yen the Reich mark the pound and you</text>
  <text start="509.84" dur="4.259">look at all of them they&amp;#39;d all started</text>
  <text start="511.82" dur="4.86">out strong and a hundred percent and</text>
  <text start="514.099" dur="4.531">then all of a sudden each one of these</text>
  <text start="516.68" dur="5.64">currencies started to lose value and</text>
  <text start="518.63" dur="7.5">they all dropped to zero if you look at</text>
  <text start="522.32" dur="6.3">the dollar it has lost 97 percent of its</text>
  <text start="526.13" dur="5.73">value all these other paper currencies</text>
  <text start="528.62" dur="5.55">lost their value over time you know what</text>
  <text start="531.86" dur="5.94">stayed constant over all these years</text>
  <text start="534.17" dur="6.96">thousands of years gold gold has stayed</text>
  <text start="537.8" dur="5.97">constant over this period of time as all</text>
  <text start="541.13" dur="6.66">other paper currencies declined in value</text>
  <text start="543.77" dur="6.45">the central banking system does not work</text>
  <text start="547.79" dur="5.64">if there&amp;#39;s no checks and balances it</text>
  <text start="550.22" dur="5.34">doesn&amp;#39;t work now the system can work</text>
  <text start="553.43" dur="4.68">without a central bank if we&amp;#39;re on the</text>
  <text start="555.56" dur="4.529">gold standard a system can work if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="558.11" dur="3.27">using crypto currencies and the central</text>
  <text start="560.089" dur="4.141">bank doesn&amp;#39;t have a hand in it</text>
  <text start="561.38" dur="5.61">all these systems can work it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="564.23" dur="5.82">central bank that is the problem now</text>
  <text start="566.99" dur="5.97">Germany they are rotating right now</text>
  <text start="570.05" dur="6.6">they&amp;#39;re moving away from the EU they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="572.96" dur="5.61">moving away from the US and the majority</text>
  <text start="576.65" dur="4.56">of Germans they don&amp;#39;t want to have a</text>
  <text start="578.57" dur="5.43">conflict with Russia they want closer</text>
  <text start="581.21" dur="5.62">cooperation and this is reflected in all</text>
  <text start="584" dur="5.08">recent opinion polls and the leaders</text>
  <text start="586.83" dur="4.53">Germany they realize this they</text>
  <text start="589.08" dur="4.53">understand that the people they want to</text>
  <text start="591.36" dur="4.86">have closer relations closer ties with</text>
  <text start="593.61" dur="6.27">Russia now think about what has been</text>
  <text start="596.22" dur="6.96">happening with Germany with the EU with</text>
  <text start="599.88" dur="5.88">the US Germany has opposed the US with</text>
  <text start="603.18" dur="6.24">Nordstrom gas pipeline bypassing Ukraine</text>
  <text start="605.76" dur="6.33">Germany has thumbed its nose not only to</text>
  <text start="609.42" dur="5.01">the US but also to the EU so they went</text>
  <text start="612.09" dur="5.16">ahead with the Nordstrom and the u.s.</text>
  <text start="614.43" dur="4.89">tried to stop them and Germany said</text>
  <text start="617.25" dur="3.93">absolutely not Germany has been</text>
  <text start="619.32" dur="4.68">instrumental in assisting Russia to</text>
  <text start="621.18" dur="6.9">freeze the situation in Donbass in</text>
  <text start="624" dur="7.35">Ukraine we see that Germany well they</text>
  <text start="628.08" dur="6.63">didn&amp;#39;t get involved with the scribble</text>
  <text start="631.35" dur="7.17">poisoning they didn&amp;#39;t back the UK claims</text>
  <text start="634.71" dur="7.05">that Russia poisoned Sergey and Ullaeus</text>
  <text start="638.52" dur="6.81">crippled Germany well guess what they</text>
  <text start="641.76" dur="6.15">stayed out of the events in Syria you</text>
  <text start="645.33" dur="4.92">know the gas attack in Douma Germany</text>
  <text start="647.91" dur="4.17">didn&amp;#39;t immediately condemn and when the</text>
  <text start="650.25" dur="5.61">unholy alliance decided on an attack</text>
  <text start="652.08" dur="7.02">Germany did not participate all of these</text>
  <text start="655.86" dur="8.58">events point to an easing away from the</text>

  <text start="670.17" dur="6.72">economic growth there they see the Silk</text>
  <text start="673.05" dur="6.45">Road and Germany is looking to join the</text>
  <text start="676.89" dur="5.79">Silk Road what&amp;#39;s happening right now is</text>
  <text start="679.5" dur="5.82">the countries in Europe when the u.s.</text>
  <text start="682.68" dur="4.2">said we need to sanction Russia most of</text>
  <text start="685.32" dur="4.38">the countries in Europe was that okay</text>
  <text start="686.88" dur="6.12">let&amp;#39;s sanction Russia and it hurt their</text>
  <text start="689.7" dur="5.64">economy it didn&amp;#39;t benefit them and now</text>
  <text start="693" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re saying it is a mistake and we</text>
  <text start="695.34" dur="4.2">can see that a lot of these countries</text>
  <text start="696.93" dur="5.31">well they&amp;#39;re not joining in with the</text>
  <text start="699.54" dur="4.59">u.s. anymore we can see that with Syria</text>
  <text start="702.24" dur="4.44">a lot of them were saying we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="704.13" dur="5.07">getting involved in this Germany Italy</text>
  <text start="706.68" dur="4.32">and we can see there&amp;#39;s a division right</text>
  <text start="709.2" dur="3.33">now and a lot of these countries are</text>
  <text start="711" dur="5.49">going to be looking at Russia and China</text>
  <text start="712.53" dur="7.44">this is the transition this is how it</text>
  <text start="716.49" dur="4.17">begins and of course those in power the</text>
  <text start="719.97" dur="2.609">deep state</text>
  <text start="720.66" dur="3.84">arrest they&amp;#39;re always trying to pull</text>
  <text start="722.579" dur="3.87">them back and the way they do this is</text>
  <text start="724.5" dur="3.48">with certain events and things to say</text>
  <text start="726.449" dur="3.151">see this is why you can&amp;#39;t go to Russia</text>
  <text start="727.98" dur="3.69">this is why you can&amp;#39;t move to China this</text>
  <text start="729.6" dur="4.979">is why you can&amp;#39;t look in that direction</text>
  <text start="731.67" dur="5.43">but we can see that the establishment</text>
  <text start="734.579" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re losing their grip and a lot of</text>
  <text start="737.1" dur="4.56">these countries are going to be moving</text>
  <text start="739.199" dur="5.19">towards the East the transition is</text>
  <text start="741.66" dur="5.119">happening right now and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="744.389" dur="5.19">accelerate as we move along here and</text>
  <text start="746.779" dur="5.8">basically what&amp;#39;s going to happen is as</text>
  <text start="749.579" dur="4.921">we transition as the system comes down</text>
  <text start="752.579" dur="4.2">just like the IMF says there&amp;#39;s just too</text>
  <text start="754.5" dur="5.31">much debt they know if nothing is done</text>
  <text start="756.779" dur="5.131">the system implodes on itself they are</text>
  <text start="759.81" dur="3.81">to blame because most of the countries</text>
  <text start="761.91" dur="3.75">are gonna say you were managing the</text>
  <text start="763.62" dur="4.319">system what happened you put us into</text>
  <text start="765.66" dur="3.84">this debt we&amp;#39;re holding a lot of debt a</text>
  <text start="767.939" dur="3.871">lot of people weren&amp;#39;t working the</text>
  <text start="769.5" dur="3.839">economies aren&amp;#39;t working as well then</text>
  <text start="771.81" dur="3.18">you&amp;#39;re gonna find out that a lot of the</text>
  <text start="773.339" dur="3.511">numbers are manipulated then you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="774.99" dur="3.719">gonna hear all about the things they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="776.85" dur="3.929">been doing in the background that no one</text>
  <text start="778.709" dur="4.291">really knew about it always comes out</text>
  <text start="780.779" dur="4.081">once everything starts to crash just</text>
  <text start="783" dur="3.209">like the subprime securities when</text>
  <text start="784.86" dur="3.719">everyone learned hey they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="786.209" dur="4.711">triple-a anymore they never were they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="788.579" dur="4.891">garbage that all these corporations</text>
  <text start="790.92" dur="4.56">needed a bailout when they told us</text>
  <text start="793.47" dur="3.599">everything was contained and eventually</text>
  <text start="795.48" dur="3.479">what happens is when everything starts</text>
  <text start="797.069" dur="4.08">to implode on itself this is when you</text>
  <text start="798.959" dur="3.451">learn all of this because in the</text>
  <text start="801.149" dur="3.42">beginning stages they&amp;#39;re able to cover</text>
  <text start="802.41" dur="3.57">it all up when it implodes and everyone</text>
  <text start="804.569" dur="3.301">points the finger people start to look</text>
  <text start="805.98" dur="4.62">into it and all of a sudden you start to</text>
  <text start="807.87" dur="5.699">realize hey look what they&amp;#39;ve done here</text>
  <text start="810.6" dur="4.979">they lied to us and this time we need to</text>
  <text start="813.569" dur="4.62">hold the bankers the central bankers</text>
  <text start="815.579" dur="4.801">accountable and this is why I think the</text>
  <text start="818.189" dur="4.08">move is going to be made to get rid of</text>
  <text start="820.38" dur="4.319">the central bank they&amp;#39;re gonna push</text>
  <text start="822.269" dur="4.831">auditing they&amp;#39;re going to investigate</text>
  <text start="824.699" dur="4.74">when everything is said and done they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="827.1" dur="5.01">gonna make their move because they need</text>
  <text start="829.439" dur="4.83">to cut off the funding to the</text>
  <text start="832.11" dur="5.37">establishment the deep state this is the</text>
  <text start="834.269" dur="5.94">only way to completely stop them is to</text>
  <text start="837.48" dur="6.12">go after the funding and to go after</text>
  <text start="840.209" dur="6.841">what has been basically the enslavement</text>
  <text start="843.6" dur="6.51">of the people of the world because what</text>
  <text start="847.05" dur="6.479">they&amp;#39;ve done was is they made us work as</text>
  <text start="850.11" dur="4.32">much as we possibly can while the value</text>
  <text start="853.529" dur="2.581">of the</text>
  <text start="854.43" dur="3.69">and the rest of the currencies around</text>
  <text start="856.11" dur="4.8">the world continually decline which</text>
  <text start="858.12" dur="5.07">means you have to work even harder just</text>
  <text start="860.91" dur="3.42">to get by and you have to keep doing</text>
  <text start="863.19" dur="3.6">this and as the value of the dollar</text>
  <text start="864.33" dur="4.74">keeps decreasing you have to continually</text>
  <text start="866.79" dur="5.37">work harder and harder and harder now</text>
  <text start="869.07" dur="5.22">people who are coming into the system</text>
  <text start="872.16" dur="5.61">and these are the younger generation</text>
  <text start="874.29" dur="5.7">they&amp;#39;re realizing wow this economy is</text>
  <text start="877.77" dur="4.77">very tough there&amp;#39;s no jobs houses are</text>
  <text start="879.99" dur="4.38">too expensive everything is too much and</text>
  <text start="882.54" dur="3.57">everything is a payment and this is why</text>
  <text start="884.37" dur="4.56">many of the individuals are living with</text>
  <text start="886.11" dur="4.68">their parents those individuals the</text>
  <text start="888.93" dur="3.69">older generation that started out with</text>
  <text start="890.79" dur="3.54">the Fayette system in the beginning</text>
  <text start="892.62" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re not really realizing this</text>
  <text start="894.33" dur="4.35">because they were on the upside we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="896.76" dur="3.45">now on the downside and they&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="898.68" dur="4.53">made their money even though it&amp;#39;s losing</text>
  <text start="900.21" dur="5.52">value like crazy they don&amp;#39;t realize it</text>
  <text start="903.21" dur="5.25">until they retire and then once they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="905.73" dur="4.74">on a fixed income and everything</text>
  <text start="908.46" dur="5.22">continually rises in price which means</text>
  <text start="910.47" dur="5.07">the dollar D values then they start to</text>
  <text start="913.68" dur="4.08">realize it and then they say oh I have</text>
  <text start="915.54" dur="5.1">to get another job just to make ends</text>
  <text start="917.76" dur="4.71">meet because I can&amp;#39;t afford the rent I</text>
  <text start="920.64" dur="3.51">can&amp;#39;t afford the food I can&amp;#39;t afford</text>
  <text start="922.47" dur="4.35">anything because my income is fixed now</text>
  <text start="924.15" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s when they realize it especially</text>
  <text start="926.82" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;ll realize it when they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="928.05" dur="3.48">getting their pensions when instead of a</text>
  <text start="930.3" dur="3.96">hundred percent of the pension they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="931.53" dur="4.62">only getting 60 percent 50 percent 40</text>
  <text start="934.26" dur="4.59">percent of the pension this is the</text>
  <text start="936.15" dur="5.37">endgame that we are watching wages are</text>
  <text start="938.85" dur="5.34">decreasing countries are transitioning</text>
  <text start="941.52" dur="5.76">over to the East moving away from the</text>
  <text start="944.19" dur="4.29">dollar and this is going to put us in a</text>
  <text start="947.28" dur="3.87">situation where it&amp;#39;s going to be very</text>
  <text start="948.48" dur="4.05">difficult for many people and when we go</text>
  <text start="951.15" dur="3.54">through this transition just like we</text>
  <text start="952.53" dur="4.08">came on to the petro dollar you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="954.69" dur="3.3">see bumps in the road and these bumps</text>
  <text start="956.61" dur="2.76">are gonna be a lot larger than when we</text>
  <text start="957.99" dur="3.3">went on to the petro dollar because we</text>
  <text start="959.37" dur="3.92">have a huge amount of debt and the value</text>
  <text start="961.29" dur="4.2">of the dollars decrease so much and</text>
  <text start="963.29" dur="3.94">there&amp;#39;s nothing really backing it any</text>
  <text start="965.49" dur="3.6">more and countries are gonna get wind of</text>
  <text start="967.23" dur="4.83">this and they&amp;#39;re gonna start dumping it</text>
  <text start="969.09" dur="5.73">like crazy and this is when things start</text>
  <text start="972.06" dur="4.98">to go really really badly for pretty</text>
  <text start="974.82" dur="4.38">much everybody except those who are</text>
  <text start="977.04" dur="4.23">prepared to protect their wealth with</text>
  <text start="979.2" dur="4.14">gold silver cryptocurrencies having food</text>
  <text start="981.27" dur="4.68">water supplies because when inflation</text>
  <text start="983.34" dur="4.77">hits guess what you won&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="985.95" dur="3.81">afford the food or the supplies</text>
  <text start="988.11" dur="4.56">out there this is why you need to have</text>
  <text start="989.76" dur="4.889">the supplies in house for a time being</text>
