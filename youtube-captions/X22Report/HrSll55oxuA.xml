  <text start="76.229" dur="8.081">deep state they really have no options</text>
  <text start="80.289" dur="6.741">left if we look at everything that has</text>
  <text start="84.31" dur="6.96">been happening right now we can see that</text>
  <text start="87.03" dur="7.03">it&amp;#39;s all coming down around the deep</text>
  <text start="91.27" dur="5.82">state and really there&amp;#39;s no way out for</text>
  <text start="94.06" dur="4.83">them at this point they tried everything</text>
  <text start="97.09" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re using the corporate media like</text>
  <text start="98.89" dur="4.35">crazy they&amp;#39;re pushing their propaganda</text>
  <text start="101.08" dur="4.429">we see the noose around the now former</text>
  <text start="103.24" dur="5.549">FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe</text>
  <text start="105.509" dur="6.851">appears to be getting tighter and we see</text>
  <text start="108.789" dur="5.071">that once again the whole thing because</text>
  <text start="112.36" dur="2.939">of what has been happening here with all</text>
  <text start="113.86" dur="4.11">these investigations with the text</text>
  <text start="115.299" dur="6.361">messages it&amp;#39;s all starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="117.97" dur="7.89">now Andrew McCabe&amp;#39;s pension is worth</text>
  <text start="121.66" dur="7.2">about 1.8 million dollars and he is set</text>
  <text start="125.86" dur="5.58">to receive this 1.8 million dollars and</text>
  <text start="128.86" dur="4.349">this is something this is just</text>
  <text start="131.44" dur="4.11">unbelievable that he&amp;#39;s still going to</text>
  <text start="133.209" dur="5.101">get his pension after what has happened</text>
  <text start="135.55" dur="5.34">here and all these individuals I think</text>
  <text start="138.31" dur="4.5">we need to take a closer look at what</text>
  <text start="140.89" dur="3.56">has been going on and maybe these</text>
  <text start="142.81" dur="5.34">individuals should not be getting a</text>
  <text start="144.45" dur="6.1">pension if once again they are try</text>
  <text start="148.15" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re convicted and things you know</text>
  <text start="150.55" dur="5.67">really go south for them we know that</text>
  <text start="153.31" dur="5.97">Trump has received the fisa memo right</text>
  <text start="156.22" dur="4.95">now it is on his desk and the White</text>
  <text start="159.28" dur="6.27">House is saying that they have about</text>
  <text start="161.17" dur="7.08">five days to look at it to declassify</text>
  <text start="165.55" dur="6.45">the material so the public can take a</text>
  <text start="168.25" dur="6.09">look at it and once again people are</text>
  <text start="172" dur="3.93">hoping that he&amp;#39;s gonna read this in the</text>
  <text start="174.34" dur="3.24">State of the Union maybe he will maybe</text>
  <text start="175.93" dur="3.6">he won&amp;#39;t but once again it really</text>
  <text start="177.58" dur="4.5">doesn&amp;#39;t matter because he&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="179.53" dur="5.25">pushing this out there and from all</text>
  <text start="182.08" dur="4.769">indications it it seems that he has no</text>
  <text start="184.78" dur="6.15">problem with releasing this</text>
  <text start="186.849" dur="7.14">now we also see that the FBI tests</text>
  <text start="190.93" dur="7.11">text messages they talk about destroying</text>
  <text start="193.989" dur="7.23">evidence scramble to find the hard</text>
  <text start="198.04" dur="5.49">drives for most likely Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="201.219" dur="4.89">and right now the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="203.53" dur="5.879">is withholding over 85% of the text</text>

  <text start="215.019" dur="5.241">department this does not include emails</text>
  <text start="216.76" dur="6.209">on personal devices now we understand</text>
  <text start="220.26" dur="5.229">right now that the corporate media they</text>
  <text start="222.969" dur="5.16">are the mouthpiece of the deep state the</text>
  <text start="225.489" dur="4.261">Cabal and they use the corporate media</text>
  <text start="228.129" dur="3.84">then again the corporate media doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="229.75" dur="5.43">do any type of investigative reporting</text>
  <text start="231.969" dur="6.811">they just listen to what they are being</text>
  <text start="235.18" dur="5.429">told now it is no secret that over the</text>
  <text start="238.78" dur="3.84">last four decades mainstream media has</text>
  <text start="240.609" dur="5.61">been consolidated from dozens of</text>
  <text start="242.62" dur="5.28">competing companies to only six hundreds</text>
  <text start="246.219" dur="4.38">of channels websites news outlets</text>

  <text start="270.88" dur="4.74">propaganda Research Center SPR has just</text>
  <text start="273.88" dur="4.44">released information that it&amp;#39;s even</text>

  <text start="278.32" dur="6.629">research group was able to tie all these</text>
  <text start="281.86" dur="7.44">media companies to a single organization</text>
  <text start="284.949" dur="8.551">and guess what this organization is the</text>
  <text start="289.3" dur="7.26">Council on Foreign Relations CFR for</text>
  <text start="293.5" dur="4.979">those who may be unaware the CFR is a</text>

  <text start="327.67" dur="6.39">SPR in the chart that they laid out what</text>
  <text start="331.27" dur="6.9">they see is that there&amp;#39;s a single</text>

  <text start="354.03" dur="6.58">integrated into the CFR and when we look</text>
  <text start="357.49" dur="4.74">at the chart we can see this the CFR has</text>
  <text start="360.61" dur="4.8">even more control than mainstream media</text>
  <text start="362.23" dur="6.21">even the Bilderberg Group and the</text>
  <text start="365.41" dur="6.24">trilateral commission and we can see</text>
  <text start="368.44" dur="7.83">that all these things all feed in to one</text>

  <text start="722.95" dur="6.63">a missile drill that went live in Hawaii</text>
  <text start="727.84" dur="4.86">people are saying that there was a</text>
  <text start="729.58" dur="6.39">missile that was actually shot off from</text>
  <text start="732.7" dur="5.27">the Guam area and it wasn&amp;#39;t a mistake</text>
  <text start="735.97" dur="4.86">there was actually a missile incoming</text>
  <text start="737.97" dur="6.16">now this could have been a test to see</text>
  <text start="740.83" dur="5.19">how people reacted what people do what</text>
  <text start="744.13" dur="4.65">the government and I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="746.02" dur="6.33">Trump what they do and they wanted to</text>
  <text start="748.78" dur="5.73">see what that reaction was or there was</text>
  <text start="752.35" dur="5.07">a missile that was headed towards Hawaii</text>
  <text start="754.51" dur="4.95">and it was intercepted because we know</text>
  <text start="757.42" dur="5.46">the NBC crew was in the bunker at the</text>
  <text start="759.46" dur="4.65">same exact time in Hawaii waiting for</text>
  <text start="762.88" dur="3.93">something to happen we know that Bill</text>
  <text start="764.11" dur="5.88">Clinton was there now I think that was</text>
  <text start="766.81" dur="4.92">set up so he could say hey we had</text>
  <text start="769.99" dur="4.2">nothing to do if it why would I fire a</text>
  <text start="771.73" dur="5.87">missile at myself that makes no sense so</text>
  <text start="774.19" dur="7.44">we are in the clear with this false flag</text>
  <text start="777.6" dur="6.01">we also understand that they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="781.63" dur="2.82">out with the Islamic state once again</text>
  <text start="783.61" dur="3.74">saying that they&amp;#39;re gonna be using</text>

  <text start="804.79" dur="5.94">right now they&amp;#39;re not that many and what</text>
  <text start="808.09" dur="4.7">they will need to cover all of this up</text>
  <text start="810.73" dur="6.27">especially when that memo comes out</text>
  <text start="812.79" dur="8.58">they&amp;#39;re going to need a distraction that</text>
  <text start="817" dur="10.17">is so large that it jams the airwaves</text>
  <text start="821.37" dur="7.15">for weeks on end and hopefully they can</text>
  <text start="827.17" dur="3.95">get us into a war that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="828.52" dur="5.18">hoping if they can&amp;#39;t get us into a war</text>
