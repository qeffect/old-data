  <text start="55.58" dur="5.28">one of these emails but I just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="58.309" dur="5.971">it&amp;#39;s impossible I am a one-man operation</text>

  <text start="64.28" dur="4.08">research for the reports and I just</text>
  <text start="66.89" dur="3.33">don&amp;#39;t have that many hours during the</text>

  <text start="87.83" dur="4.89">happening in the world why don&amp;#39;t I just</text>
  <text start="89.57" dur="5.25">report on the economy well we have to</text>
  <text start="92.72" dur="5.219">understand that all of this is</text>
  <text start="94.82" dur="5.46">interconnected it&amp;#39;s not just the economy</text>
  <text start="97.939" dur="5.96">even though I say we&amp;#39;re coming up to a</text>
  <text start="100.28" dur="6.21">collapse we&amp;#39;re looking at economic data</text>
  <text start="103.899" dur="5.311">everything is interconnected you have to</text>
  <text start="106.49" dur="5.4">remember the central banking system</text>
  <text start="109.21" dur="6.67">which is controlling the private western</text>
  <text start="111.89" dur="7.589">central bank&amp;#39;s systems they understand</text>
  <text start="115.88" dur="6.089">that their system right now is falling</text>
  <text start="119.479" dur="4.95">apart they&amp;#39;re continually accumulating</text>
  <text start="121.969" dur="5.521">debt and they&amp;#39;re running out of ideas</text>
  <text start="124.429" dur="6.241">and how to pay for this debt and when I</text>
  <text start="127.49" dur="4.59">say that is how are the people going to</text>
  <text start="130.67" dur="3.87">pay for this step because this is how</text>
  <text start="132.08" dur="6.03">their system works they issue the debt</text>
  <text start="134.54" dur="5.67">and they issue it with interest and they</text>
  <text start="138.11" dur="4.709">want the people to pay back this debt</text>
  <text start="140.21" dur="5.19">now what happens is the debt will always</text>
  <text start="142.819" dur="5.071">override the amount of currency that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="145.4" dur="4.38">out in the world and this is what we see</text>
  <text start="147.89" dur="3.81">happening right now and then the system</text>
  <text start="149.78" dur="4.85">starts to break down so what the central</text>
  <text start="151.7" dur="5.759">bankers do they use their influence to</text>
  <text start="154.63" dur="4.72">do other things around the world for</text>
  <text start="157.459" dur="3.931">example the US government central</text>
  <text start="159.35" dur="3.38">bankers what they&amp;#39;re doing is pushing</text>
  <text start="161.39" dur="3.53">regime change</text>
  <text start="162.73" dur="5.009">to try to set up more central banks and</text>
  <text start="164.92" dur="5.099">countries to place the dollar on their</text>
  <text start="167.739" dur="4.801">natural resources in that country was</text>
  <text start="170.019" dur="4.921">most of the time it&amp;#39;s oil to continually</text>
  <text start="172.54" dur="4.29">push debt out because those countries</text>
  <text start="174.94" dur="4.17">that don&amp;#39;t have these systems they see</text>
  <text start="176.83" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s an opportunity to continually push</text>
  <text start="179.11" dur="4.2">debt to keep the system alive but</text>
  <text start="180.58" dur="5.03">eventually what happens is they run into</text>
  <text start="183.31" dur="4.709">a brick wall and they can&amp;#39;t do this</text>
  <text start="185.61" dur="5.68">anymore and the whole thing really</text>
  <text start="188.019" dur="5.28">starts to break down fast and in the</text>
  <text start="191.29" dur="3.9">meantime what they&amp;#39;re doing in each one</text>
  <text start="193.299" dur="4.141">of these countries is they&amp;#39;re removing</text>
  <text start="195.19" dur="4.1">the freedoms of the people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="197.44" dur="6.51">spying on the people they&amp;#39;re spying on</text>
  <text start="199.29" dur="6.16">judges government employees which I use</text>
  <text start="203.95" dur="2.819">the term employees which I don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="205.45" dur="3.27">the quantum officials because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="206.769" dur="3.36">really not officials they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="208.72" dur="3.57">government employees are working for the</text>
  <text start="210.129" dur="4.23">people and we see this right now</text>
  <text start="212.29" dur="3.3">happening around the world in many of</text>
  <text start="214.359" dur="3.63">the countries especially here in the</text>
  <text start="215.59" dur="5.97">United States Canada and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="217.989" dur="5.791">happening is that they want full control</text>
  <text start="221.56" dur="5.88">of everything that&amp;#39;s going on right now</text>
  <text start="223.78" dur="5.76">and we need to look at everything we</text>
  <text start="227.44" dur="4.799">need to look at why they&amp;#39;re pushing a</text>
  <text start="229.54" dur="5.279">gun control why they&amp;#39;re spying on the</text>
  <text start="232.239" dur="4.261">people why are they provoking countries</text>
  <text start="234.819" dur="4.441">around the world why are they pushing</text>
  <text start="236.5" dur="5.13">regime change and what is going on with</text>
  <text start="239.26" dur="3.96">the economy why are they hiding certain</text>
  <text start="241.63" dur="3.78">facts from the American people and the</text>
  <text start="243.22" dur="3.66">rest of the world of how the economy is</text>
  <text start="245.41" dur="3.09">really doing and if you look at all this</text>
  <text start="246.88" dur="2.699">and you put it all together and you</text>
  <text start="248.5" dur="5.269">piece it all together you can start to</text>
  <text start="249.579" dur="7.231">see that yeah this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="253.769" dur="6.881">intertwined it&amp;#39;s connected and it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="256.81" dur="7.169">part of their plan and this is what</text>
  <text start="260.65" dur="6.12">we&amp;#39;ve been covering at this point now if</text>
  <text start="263.979" dur="4.891">we look at that and we start to</text>
  <text start="266.77" dur="5.369">understand what is happening here we see</text>
  <text start="268.87" dur="5.19">that the US government which is part</text>
  <text start="272.139" dur="4.471">really of the central banking system</text>
  <text start="274.06" dur="4.59">because when you see what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="276.61" dur="4.47">between the government and the central</text>
  <text start="278.65" dur="5.31">bank it&amp;#39;s like they&amp;#39;re melding into one</text>
  <text start="281.08" dur="4.98">now it&amp;#39;s not the full government because</text>
  <text start="283.96" dur="4.37">we have many different sections of the</text>
  <text start="286.06" dur="4.859">government like Congress we have the</text>
  <text start="288.33" dur="5.49">executive branch and parts of the</text>
  <text start="290.919" dur="5.401">government is being persuaded by other</text>
  <text start="293.82" dur="5.77">countries other foreign entity</text>
  <text start="296.32" dur="6.45">he&amp;#39;s like Israel for example and this is</text>
  <text start="299.59" dur="4.95">why we see you know the Obama</text>
  <text start="302.77" dur="4.95">administration pushing for the arraigned</text>
  <text start="304.54" dur="5.97">ale because they understand that they</text>
  <text start="307.72" dur="5.49">need to push the debt they need to put</text>
  <text start="310.51" dur="7.14">the dollar on Iran&amp;#39;s oil and then we</text>
  <text start="313.21" dur="6.78">have congressman Congress women who are</text>
  <text start="317.65" dur="5.19">taking orders from Israel saying don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="319.99" dur="6.48">let this happen so then we have two</text>
  <text start="322.84" dur="5.88">different things happening in the larger</text>
  <text start="326.47" dur="5.91">government and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="328.72" dur="6.18">right now but we understand that the</text>
  <text start="332.38" dur="7.59">central bank and the executive branch</text>
  <text start="334.9" dur="8.25">are working together pushing their</text>
  <text start="339.97" dur="6.84">agendas and they realize that they need</text>
  <text start="343.15" dur="5.67">to continually spy on everyone in this</text>
  <text start="346.81" dur="4.2">country and every other country that has</text>
  <text start="348.82" dur="3.42">a private western central bank is doing</text>
  <text start="351.01" dur="3.3">the same thing because they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="352.24" dur="5.49">worried about what other government</text>
  <text start="354.31" dur="5.64">employees are doing what the people are</text>
  <text start="357.73" dur="6.15">doing what other organizations are doing</text>
  <text start="359.95" dur="5.52">and this is why we see police</text>
  <text start="363.88" dur="5.37">departments around the world using the</text>
  <text start="365.47" dur="5.73">Stingray device the FBI is using the</text>
  <text start="369.25" dur="4.59">Stingray device and now the Secret</text>
  <text start="371.2" dur="5.01">Service is using the Stingray device</text>
  <text start="373.84" dur="4.32">without a warrant and this is a device</text>
  <text start="376.21" dur="6.3">that intercepts your cell phone calls</text>
  <text start="378.16" dur="7.55">and we can see that this is a complete</text>
  <text start="382.51" dur="10.05">violation of the Fourth Amendment now</text>
  <text start="385.71" dur="9.31">the ACLU and other plaintiffs like</text>
  <text start="392.56" dur="4.65">Wikimedia Foundation pen American Center</text>
  <text start="395.02" dur="6.09">National Association of criminal defense</text>
  <text start="397.21" dur="8.34">lawyers Amnesty International decided to</text>
  <text start="401.11" dur="5.91">sue the NSA and other agencies for</text>
  <text start="405.55" dur="4.5">violation of the Fourth Amendment and</text>
  <text start="407.02" dur="5.85">they went ahead and they filed the</text>
  <text start="410.05" dur="5.31">lawsuit and a federal district court</text>
  <text start="412.87" dur="4.65">judge in Virginia dismissed the lawsuit</text>
  <text start="415.36" dur="4.68">filed by the american silver civil</text>

  <text start="424.32" dur="7.719">americans siding with the government</text>
  <text start="430.18" dur="4.32">the judge ruled Friday that nine</text>
  <text start="432.039" dur="4.141">plaintiffs in the case had not plausibly</text>
  <text start="434.5" dur="4.41">alleged that their communications were</text>
  <text start="436.18" dur="6.269">being monitored by the NSA and they</text>
  <text start="438.91" dur="6.15">brought up to the federal judge that yes</text>
  <text start="442.449" dur="4.911">we do have proof and for some reason the</text>
  <text start="445.06" dur="4.53">judge didn&amp;#39;t want to listen and</text>
  <text start="447.36" dur="5.77">continually cited with the government</text>
  <text start="449.59" dur="6.27">now we know the NSA is spying on judges</text>
  <text start="453.13" dur="4.89">government employees and other people</text>
  <text start="455.86" dur="5.61">and they use the information they</text>
  <text start="458.02" dur="7.26">receive as blackmail to make judges do</text>
  <text start="461.47" dur="5.91">certain things and one of the things</text>
  <text start="465.28" dur="4.919">they said is that under the prism</text>
  <text start="467.38" dur="7.53">program that the government runs the</text>
  <text start="470.199" dur="10.111">prison program gathers 250 million</text>
  <text start="474.91" dur="7.53">communications a year as of 2011 in 2014</text>
  <text start="480.31" dur="4.889">the government targeted the</text>
  <text start="482.44" dur="6.229">communications of more than 92,000</text>
  <text start="485.199" dur="8.161">individuals groups and organizations</text>
  <text start="488.669" dur="6.461">using this system and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="493.36" dur="4.17">that the NSA&amp;#39;s mass surveillance</text>
  <text start="495.13" dur="4.77">violates all our clients constitutional</text>
  <text start="497.53" dur="4.949">rights to privacy freedom of speech</text>
  <text start="499.9" dur="5.13">freedom of association and it poses a</text>
  <text start="502.479" dur="4.711">grave threat to a free internet and a</text>
  <text start="505.03" dur="5.28">free society this is coming from Ashley</text>
  <text start="507.19" dur="8.7">Gorski which is an attorney for the ACLU</text>
  <text start="510.31" dur="7.89">and she&amp;#39;s absolutely right but here we</text>
  <text start="515.89" dur="3.69">see the court not looking at the Fourth</text>
  <text start="518.2" dur="3.42">Amendment not looking at the rights of</text>
  <text start="519.58" dur="4.199">the people and saying well you know</text>
  <text start="521.62" dur="4.23">something you can&amp;#39;t really prove</text>
  <text start="523.779" dur="4.281">everything so we&amp;#39;re gonna have to throw</text>
  <text start="525.85" dur="5.64">it out and they were producing documents</text>
  <text start="528.06" dur="6.04">showing that yes they have been spying</text>
  <text start="531.49" dur="4.92">on American people but we see what the</text>
  <text start="534.1" dur="6.57">government does today we see the poll</text>
  <text start="536.41" dur="9.6">they have we see how blackmail works now</text>
  <text start="540.67" dur="8.94">out in Ukraine we see the military has</text>
  <text start="546.01" dur="6.449">been shelling Donetsk over the last six</text>
  <text start="549.61" dur="8.01">hours and we start to see this as a</text>
  <text start="552.459" dur="9.091">run-up to testing Donetsk testing to see</text>
  <text start="557.62" dur="6.29">how far they can push the ceasefire and</text>
  <text start="561.55" dur="5.099">we know the ceasefire</text>
  <text start="563.91" dur="4.079">expires the end of this year and of</text>
  <text start="566.649" dur="5.42">course we&amp;#39;ve been hearing from</text>

  <text start="572.069" dur="4.93">the Mint&amp;#39;s to agreement is the only</text>

  <text start="576.999" dur="6.24">nothing left and that tells me that they</text>
  <text start="581.739" dur="4.111">are definitely waiting to see if the</text>
  <text start="583.239" dur="5.34">ceasefire expires they haven&amp;#39;t made any</text>
  <text start="585.85" dur="7.109">case about extending it after the end of</text>

  <text start="786.43" dur="7.01">mean the end to the European Union and</text>

  <text start="793.44" dur="8.65">closing their borders placing guards at</text>
  <text start="797.92" dur="6.27">the borders and right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="802.09" dur="5.52">debating whether to send hundreds of</text>
  <text start="804.19" dur="7.62">guards to their borders to send troops</text>
  <text start="807.61" dur="8.58">and ships to block all of these refugees</text>
  <text start="811.81" dur="8.91">and the situation is getting worse and</text>
  <text start="816.19" dur="7.47">worse as time goes on and it&amp;#39;s starting</text>
  <text start="820.72" dur="5.55">to fall apart we see in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="823.66" dur="3.6">where Saudi Arabia which is the proxy</text>
  <text start="826.27" dur="4.59">force for the United States government</text>
  <text start="827.26" dur="4.18">is continually bombarding Yemen the who</text>
  <text start="830.86" dur="2.38">these are</text>
  <text start="831.44" dur="4.56">holding strong and this is the people of</text>
  <text start="833.24" dur="5.64">Yemen they kicked out the puppet</text>
  <text start="836" dur="4.56">government and the United States want</text>
  <text start="838.88" dur="3.66">but wants the puppet government back in</text>
  <text start="840.56" dur="3.57">power because once we place a puppet</text>
  <text start="842.54" dur="3.24">government in your country you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="844.13" dur="4.47">allowed to kick them out there&amp;#39;ll be no</text>
  <text start="845.78" dur="4.92">democracy for you there&amp;#39;ll be no freedom</text>
  <text start="848.6" dur="3.15">you have to do what we say this is</text>
  <text start="850.7" dur="4.68">basically what they&amp;#39;re telling the</text>
  <text start="851.75" dur="7.44">people there so right now the US has</text>
  <text start="855.38" dur="10.41">pledged more guns ammo to Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="859.19" dur="8.51">to help with the fighting in Yemen the</text>
  <text start="865.79" dur="5.16">United States has been dropping</text>
  <text start="867.7" dur="5.62">ammunition to the Free Syrian Army which</text>
  <text start="870.95" dur="5.19">they rebranded to the syrian democratic</text>
  <text start="873.32" dur="4.49">forces and you can call them whatever</text>
  <text start="876.14" dur="4.4">they want they&amp;#39;re still terrorists</text>
  <text start="877.81" dur="7.36">basically they&amp;#39;re all the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="880.54" dur="9.04">so they dropped the 50-ton worth of ammo</text>
  <text start="885.17" dur="8.73">in Syria and they did this on october</text>
  <text start="889.58" dur="7.86">eleventh and the the forces on the</text>
  <text start="893.9" dur="6.51">ground the Free Syrian Army the Kurds</text>
  <text start="897.44" dur="4.65">and everyone else is saying we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="900.41" dur="4.65">know where this went we&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="902.09" dur="5.28">received it where do they drop this and</text>
  <text start="905.06" dur="3.81">right now it&amp;#39;s up in question who</text>
  <text start="907.37" dur="3.48">actually receive this well I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="908.87" dur="5.76">tell you who received it the Islamic</text>
  <text start="910.85" dur="8.25">state as usual that is their main proxy</text>
  <text start="914.63" dur="7.53">force to remove Assad now we understand</text>
  <text start="919.1" dur="4.62">that Russia has been bombarding the</text>
  <text start="922.16" dur="2.82">Islamic state or the proxy army of the</text>
  <text start="923.72" dur="3.21">United States government Israel and the</text>
  <text start="924.98" dur="4.44">coalition forces and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="926.93" dur="4.68">releasing video after video showing this</text>
  <text start="929.42" dur="4.05">how they&amp;#39;re taking down and destroying</text>
  <text start="931.61" dur="4.11">their weapons destroying the supply</text>
  <text start="933.47" dur="4.65">lines so the US decided you know what</text>
  <text start="935.72" dur="4.74">we&amp;#39;re going to release a video too we</text>
  <text start="938.12" dur="5.19">had our military force with a gopro</text>
  <text start="940.46" dur="6.51">helmet cam footage and he filmed the</text>
  <text start="943.31" dur="8.07">whole thing of basically a special ops</text>
  <text start="946.97" dur="9.72">prison raid where one American soldier</text>
  <text start="951.38" dur="7.62">did die and we see that they film the</text>
  <text start="956.69" dur="5.04">whole thing now a couple things stood</text>
  <text start="959" dur="5.37">out here I didn&amp;#39;t see any of the forces</text>
  <text start="961.73" dur="3.5">inside the room or around the entire</text>
  <text start="964.37" dur="4.79">area</text>
  <text start="965.23" dur="6.66">I didn&amp;#39;t see any bullet holes and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="969.16" dur="6.03">very interesting is that in this little</text>
  <text start="971.89" dur="5.1">tiny room they had the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="975.19" dur="4.41">flag in there you know right on the wall</text>
  <text start="976.99" dur="5.91">which is you know seems like it&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="979.6" dur="4.8">of a setup to make you realize and make</text>
  <text start="982.9" dur="4.56">sure you understand that this was the</text>
  <text start="984.4" dur="5.52">Islamic state and when you kind of</text>
  <text start="987.46" dur="4.74">produce things you need to add these</text>
  <text start="989.92" dur="5.64">things to let everyone know this is what</text>
  <text start="992.2" dur="4.8">we are doing and when I continually look</text>
  <text start="995.56" dur="3.42">at this and look at this it looks like</text>
  <text start="997" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s a training type of mission it</text>
  <text start="998.98" dur="3.57">doesn&amp;#39;t really look real but you could</text>
  <text start="1001.14" dur="3.72">take a look at it yourself i have it on</text>
  <text start="1002.55" dur="4.95">the x 22 report com site and let me know</text>
  <text start="1004.86" dur="3.96">what you think of this but it feels like</text>
  <text start="1007.5" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;re doing the same thing with bin</text>
  <text start="1008.82" dur="4.56">Laden when they went to get him it feels</text>
  <text start="1010.74" dur="4.29">like it&amp;#39;s one of those things where they</text>
  <text start="1013.38" dur="3.24">had to put something out there to show</text>
  <text start="1015.03" dur="5.67">the world that yes we&amp;#39;re going after the</text>
  <text start="1016.62" dur="6.75">Islamic state and it seems a little fake</text>
  <text start="1020.7" dur="5.34">to me when I every time I review it gets</text>
  <text start="1023.37" dur="6.6">it looks worse and worse every single</text>
  <text start="1026.04" dur="8.97">time now the US as we know wants to set</text>
  <text start="1029.97" dur="7.98">up a buffer zone to save the areas</text>
  <text start="1035.01" dur="6.18">inside of Turkey for the refugees but</text>
  <text start="1037.95" dur="5.01">their real plan is to set it up to save</text>
  <text start="1041.19" dur="3.96">the Islamic state because what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1042.96" dur="4.31">happening right now is Russia is pushing</text>
  <text start="1045.15" dur="4.56">back the United States proxy army</text>
  <text start="1047.27" dur="4.84">destroying their supply lines and if</text>
  <text start="1049.71" dur="6">they set up this buffer zone they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1052.11" dur="6.48">have a safe area and though it will be</text>
  <text start="1055.71" dur="5.22">able to keep the supply lines open from</text>
  <text start="1058.59" dur="5.22">Turkey and this is why they really want</text>
  <text start="1060.93" dur="5.07">the safe zones or the buffer zones right</text>
  <text start="1063.81" dur="4.32">now and we see a lot of the government</text>
  <text start="1066" dur="5.99">employees out there pushing the idea</text>
  <text start="1068.13" dur="7.32">that yes we definitely need this and</text>
  <text start="1071.99" dur="5.92">this is not about you know helping the</text>
  <text start="1075.45" dur="8.25">refugees it&amp;#39;s not about doing anything</text>
  <text start="1077.91" dur="8.64">but saving the proxy army partitioning</text>
  <text start="1083.7" dur="4.86">Syria and saying this is off limits but</text>
  <text start="1086.55" dur="5.18">I don&amp;#39;t think this is going to work Iraq</text>
  <text start="1088.56" dur="6.3">is saying you know something Russia is</text>
  <text start="1091.73" dur="4.72">destroying the Islamic state United</text>
  <text start="1094.86" dur="4.18">States government and the coalition&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1096.45" dur="4.93">are not a senior Iraqi ledge</text>
  <text start="1099.04" dur="4.38">later blasted the west led coalition</text>
  <text start="1101.38" dur="6.18">saying that everything that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1103.42" dur="7.95">doing isn&amp;#39;t working it seems like</text>
  <text start="1107.56" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re not even trying to hit the</text>
  <text start="1111.37" dur="5.79">Islamic state he says the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="1113.08" dur="6.9">a complete hoax well yeah it is and it</text>
  <text start="1117.16" dur="7.38">looks like Russia might be getting ready</text>
  <text start="1119.98" dur="7.05">to go into Iraq right now and bomb the</text>
  <text start="1124.54" dur="7.92">Islamic state they might be in Iraq and</text>
  <text start="1127.03" dur="8.82">Syria at this point now President Putin</text>
  <text start="1132.46" dur="5.97">and President Assad are doing something</text>
  <text start="1135.85" dur="3.69">very very interesting right now because</text>
  <text start="1138.43" dur="2.85">as we know the United States government</text>
  <text start="1139.54" dur="4.5">central bankers are continually saying</text>
  <text start="1141.28" dur="4.68">the people of Syria don&amp;#39;t want to sod</text>
  <text start="1144.04" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re completely against him and as we</text>
  <text start="1145.96" dur="2.97">know the last elections he received like</text>
  <text start="1147.43" dur="5.61">86 or eighty-seven percent of the vote</text>
  <text start="1148.93" dur="6">and Assad decided you know something he</text>
  <text start="1153.04" dur="8.28">is ready to discuss amendments to the</text>
  <text start="1154.93" dur="9.09">Constitution and hold new elections to</text>
  <text start="1161.32" dur="5.79">allow the people to vote who they want</text>
  <text start="1164.02" dur="5.64">in office so if the people deem this</text>
  <text start="1167.11" dur="4.17">necessary he will do this so what</text>
  <text start="1169.66" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1171.28" dur="6">calling the bluff of the United States</text>
  <text start="1174.55" dur="6.48">government central bankers saying we are</text>
  <text start="1177.28" dur="7.68">going to show the world right now that</text>
  <text start="1181.03" dur="7.41">the people of Syria want Assad as</text>
  <text start="1184.96" dur="4.8">president and the United States won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="1188.44" dur="2.13">able to say anything now of course</text>
  <text start="1189.76" dur="2.76">they&amp;#39;re going to come out and saying</text>
  <text start="1190.57" dur="6.75">well well you can&amp;#39;t have elections</text>
  <text start="1192.52" dur="6.09">because parts of Syria are not part of</text>
  <text start="1197.32" dur="3.42">the government and everyone is not</text>
  <text start="1198.61" dur="4.77">voting and then Russia will turn around</text>
  <text start="1200.74" dur="6.6">well didn&amp;#39;t you have the same situation</text>
  <text start="1203.38" dur="8.1">in Ukraine parts of Ukraine were not</text>
  <text start="1207.34" dur="7.14">part of the Ukrainian government and you</text>
  <text start="1211.48" dur="5.13">had elections there so this is going to</text>
