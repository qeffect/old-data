  <text start="88.13" dur="6.36">many different parts of the plan that</text>
  <text start="90.95" dur="5.79">are moving all at the same time and we</text>
  <text start="94.49" dur="3.18">can see that the Muller report is about</text>
  <text start="96.74" dur="3.24">to come out</text>
  <text start="97.67" dur="3.66">we know the D class is going to happen</text>
  <text start="99.98" dur="5.1">and that&amp;#39;s going to come up very soon</text>
  <text start="101.33" dur="5.9">and we realize that Trump the Patriots</text>
  <text start="105.08" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;ll be going after the central bank</text>
  <text start="107.23" dur="6.82">q has been referencing the Federal</text>
  <text start="110.72" dur="6">Reserve telling us that gold will bring</text>
  <text start="114.05" dur="5.28">down the Federal Reserve and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="116.72" dur="5.97">seeing different things happen within</text>
  <text start="119.33" dur="5.31">the trump administration we also see</text>
  <text start="122.69" dur="5.19">other countries are ramping up their</text>
  <text start="124.64" dur="5.519">gold purchases now just like Trump of</text>
  <text start="127.88" dur="5.49">the Patriots are using military planning</text>
  <text start="130.159" dur="4.291">to bring down the deep state where they</text>
  <text start="133.37" dur="2.82">just didn&amp;#39;t go in and say hey listen</text>
  <text start="134.45" dur="3.509">we&amp;#39;re taking over the deep States gonna</text>
  <text start="136.19" dur="3.96">be arrested and that&amp;#39;s that they knew</text>
  <text start="137.959" dur="5.371">that wouldn&amp;#39;t work so they had to use</text>
  <text start="140.15" dur="6.059">this plan that would work in stealth</text>
  <text start="143.33" dur="4.53">mode where they could remove certain</text>
  <text start="146.209" dur="4.95">people in the FBI Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="147.86" dur="5.73">get rid of the blockage to Clinton and</text>
  <text start="151.159" dur="6.031">many others we place a lot of judges</text>
  <text start="153.59" dur="5.64">within the Sixth Circuit Fourth Circuit</text>
  <text start="157.19" dur="4.5">Ninth Circuit and in the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="159.23" dur="4.83">and</text>
  <text start="161.69" dur="7.05">push certain legislation executive</text>
  <text start="164.06" dur="7.68">orders to trap these individuals in</text>
  <text start="168.74" dur="6.24">their dealings while these individuals</text>
  <text start="171.74" dur="5.78">go about their everyday business I think</text>
  <text start="174.98" dur="5.7">the same thing is happening now with the</text>
  <text start="177.52" dur="6.1">central bank because we can see many</text>
  <text start="180.68" dur="4.44">different things happening but if you</text>
  <text start="183.62" dur="3.78">just look at them it looks like</text>
  <text start="185.12" dur="4.86">nothing&amp;#39;s happening but if you start to</text>
  <text start="187.4" dur="5.28">put them all together you can see the</text>
  <text start="189.98" dur="4.77">plan is starting to evolve and we&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="192.68" dur="4.77">talking about that in just a moment but</text>
  <text start="194.75" dur="4.56">I wanted to go out to the UK once again</text>
  <text start="197.45" dur="5.55">and this is part of the pan the brexit</text>
  <text start="199.31" dur="5.52">they want this to happen and this is why</text>
  <text start="203" dur="5.31">the people and those in government</text>
  <text start="204.83" dur="5.73">within the UK they are holding out</text>
  <text start="208.31" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re not just agreeing to Mays plan</text>
  <text start="210.56" dur="5.25">to the central bank&amp;#39;s plan I believe</text>
  <text start="213.74" dur="6.45">they should just completely separate</text>
  <text start="215.81" dur="8.55">themselves and let the EU go their way</text>
  <text start="220.19" dur="6.69">and let the UK go their way and see how</text>
  <text start="224.36" dur="4.44">the chips fall I believe the UK is gonna</text>
  <text start="226.88" dur="4.859">make out and EU is gonna be in trouble</text>
  <text start="228.8" dur="6.03">but we see right now that Prime Minister</text>
  <text start="231.739" dur="5.461">Teresa may her withdrawal agreement well</text>
  <text start="234.83" dur="4.89">it looks like it might lose by a hundred</text>
  <text start="237.2" dur="4.5">votes I mean the unelected peers in the</text>
  <text start="239.72" dur="5.55">House of Lords they voted in favor of</text>
  <text start="241.7" dur="6.33">staying with the EU again always the</text>
  <text start="245.27" dur="5.1">unelected people they do exactly what</text>
  <text start="248.03" dur="4.53">the central bank wants the elected</text>
  <text start="250.37" dur="4.53">people and the people that were voted in</text>
  <text start="252.56" dur="5.13">by the people well that&amp;#39;s a different</text>
  <text start="254.9" dur="4.67">story and the people of the UK they</text>
  <text start="257.69" dur="5.58">don&amp;#39;t want the deal that may is pushing</text>
  <text start="259.57" dur="6.37">but again the central bank they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="263.27" dur="5.01">push back as hard as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="265.94" dur="6.62">and I do believe there will be a time</text>
  <text start="268.28" dur="6.84">where most likely there will be no deal</text>
  <text start="272.56" dur="3.85">now the central bank and we talked about</text>
  <text start="275.12" dur="3.42">the central bank quite a bit I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="276.41" dur="3.509">about the federal reserve ECB Biz IMF</text>
  <text start="278.54" dur="2.46">you name and all the other private</text>
  <text start="279.919" dur="4.771">wasn&amp;#39;t central banks throughout the</text>
  <text start="281" dur="6">world I know the governments of the</text>
  <text start="284.69" dur="4.35">world saying hey listen to help the</text>
  <text start="287" dur="4.8">people out we need to give them raises</text>
  <text start="289.04" dur="3.959">we need to up minimum wage we need to</text>
  <text start="291.8" dur="6.349">make it better but</text>
  <text start="292.999" dur="7.71">the thing is over time this never works</text>
  <text start="298.149" dur="4.36">you have to go to the source of the</text>
  <text start="300.709" dur="5.55">problem I mean look at a perfect example</text>
  <text start="302.509" dur="5">here in the United States just four</text>
  <text start="306.259" dur="4.89">months ago</text>
  <text start="307.509" dur="6.07">Amazon enacted a $15 minimum wage for</text>
  <text start="311.149" dur="5.88">all of its employees on November 1st</text>
  <text start="313.579" dur="6.48">Whole Foods they brought everyone up to</text>
  <text start="317.029" dur="8.01">$15 you know what most of these stores</text>
  <text start="320.059" dur="7.17">have done they cut their hours yes they</text>
  <text start="325.039" dur="5.34">might be making more but they brought</text>
  <text start="327.229" dur="6.96">their hours back down so they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="330.379" dur="6.15">the same exact money so this is the</text>
  <text start="334.189" dur="4.2">first problem the second problem is is</text>
  <text start="336.529" dur="5.13">that the Federal Reserve note the debt</text>
  <text start="338.389" dur="6.75">note is going to continually lose value</text>
  <text start="341.659" dur="6.69">over time raising the minimum wage will</text>
  <text start="345.139" dur="5.61">only help for a very short period of</text>
  <text start="348.349" dur="4.56">time and once the dollar continually</text>
  <text start="350.749" dur="4.26">loses value which they call inflation</text>
  <text start="352.909" dur="5.82">guess what you need to raise it again</text>
  <text start="355.009" dur="7.32">this is the source of the problem the</text>
  <text start="358.729" dur="6.06">devaluation of the dollar because the</text>
  <text start="362.329" dur="7.05">Federal Reserve it their debt note is</text>
  <text start="364.789" dur="6.33">dead and this is the main problem and</text>
  <text start="369.379" dur="3.72">eventually what we&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
  <text start="371.119" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to tackle the main</text>
  <text start="373.099" dur="5.18">problem which trumpet the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="374.929" dur="6.36">going to do we see right now Trump is</text>
  <text start="378.279" dur="6.01">continuing with trying to even out the</text>
  <text start="381.289" dur="5.16">playing field with trade Trump announced</text>
  <text start="384.289" dur="4.86">plans and key trade preferences for</text>
  <text start="386.449" dur="6.3">India and Turkey this is his latest move</text>
  <text start="389.149" dur="6.75">to counter what he calls unfair trade</text>
  <text start="392.749" dur="5.91">practices Trump notified Congress on</text>
  <text start="395.899" dur="5.16">March 4th and a letter of his intent to</text>
  <text start="398.659" dur="5.79">terminate and he&amp;#39;s going to terminate</text>
  <text start="401.059" dur="6.03">trade benefits for both countries and of</text>
  <text start="404.449" dur="4.79">course he wants to work on a new trade</text>
  <text start="407.089" dur="4.86">deal with these countries remember</text>
  <text start="409.239" dur="5.35">everything that was set everything that</text>
  <text start="411.949" dur="6.24">was agreed upon was for the globalist</text>
  <text start="414.589" dur="7.86">model everything has to be undone right</text>
  <text start="418.189" dur="8.281">now and it has to be reset for the new</text>
  <text start="422.449" dur="6.661">economy that will be going into and we</text>
  <text start="426.47" dur="5.49">oh that Trump he&amp;#39;s doing everything he</text>
  <text start="429.11" dur="5.88">possibly can as fast as he possibly can</text>
  <text start="431.96" dur="5.34">to get the economy ready I know a lot of</text>
  <text start="434.99" dur="4.23">people talk about oh look we&amp;#39;re adding a</text>
  <text start="437.3" dur="4.65">lot more data on oh look we&amp;#39;re spending</text>
  <text start="439.22" dur="4.68">a lot more money yes this is on purpose</text>
  <text start="441.95" dur="4.8">actually I&amp;#39;ve had many people that I</text>
  <text start="443.9" dur="4.29">known who declared bankruptcy and right</text>
  <text start="446.75" dur="4.05">before they declared bankruptcy you know</text>
  <text start="448.19" dur="4.92">what they did they piled on more debt</text>
  <text start="450.8" dur="4.26">what do I mean by this they bought a lot</text>
  <text start="453.11" dur="7.5">of stuff then they declared bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="455.06" dur="8.49">and they kept all that stuff Trump he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="460.61" dur="5.73">pushing this economy to the edge why not</text>
  <text start="463.55" dur="5.52">use the central bank debt note for</text>
  <text start="466.34" dur="6.45">everything that you need to do to get</text>
  <text start="469.07" dur="6.6">the economy prepared for this transition</text>
  <text start="472.79" dur="3.42">into a new economy so basically what</text>
  <text start="475.67" dur="3.57">he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="476.21" dur="5.34">he&amp;#39;s using everything against them the</text>
  <text start="479.24" dur="3.69">statistical information the stock market</text>
  <text start="481.55" dur="3.21">when I say statistical information about</text>
  <text start="482.93" dur="3.81">GDP unemployment and everything else</text>
  <text start="484.76" dur="5.46">he&amp;#39;s using the Federal Reserve fiat</text>
  <text start="486.74" dur="6.63">currency against them and we know that</text>
  <text start="490.22" dur="4.92">Trump has control over the central bank</text>
  <text start="493.37" dur="5.09">I mean think about it</text>
  <text start="495.14" dur="7.02">the Fed right now is going to be patient</text>
  <text start="498.46" dur="7.12">we know that Q has told us their plan</text>
  <text start="502.16" dur="6.96">was to raise interest rates rapidly in</text>
  <text start="505.58" dur="5.52">2019 to crash the economy in 2020 right</text>
  <text start="509.12" dur="5.669">now they&amp;#39;ve done nothing even if they</text>
  <text start="511.1" dur="6.059">raise it once guess what that&amp;#39;s not part</text>
  <text start="514.789" dur="5.011">of their plan but right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="517.159" dur="3.991">staying steady and more proof of this</text>
  <text start="519.8" dur="5.19">that the central banks don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="521.15" dur="7.34">exposed the European Central Bank took</text>
  <text start="524.99" dur="7.08">an unexpectedly quick action today to</text>
  <text start="528.49" dur="5.89">support this slowing economy why is the</text>
  <text start="532.07" dur="4.95">economy slowing because the central bank</text>
  <text start="534.38" dur="6.18">economy is breaking down so what did</text>
  <text start="537.02" dur="6">they do well remember the the European</text>
  <text start="540.56" dur="6.81">Central Bank they are made up of 19</text>
  <text start="543.02" dur="7.83">countries they decided not to increase</text>
  <text start="547.37" dur="6.51">the interest rates this fall instead</text>
  <text start="550.85" dur="4.71">they pushed it to the end of this year</text>
  <text start="553.88" dur="4.97">and what they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="555.56" dur="6.319">going to push it into next year</text>
  <text start="558.85" dur="5.12">why would they do this why all of a</text>
  <text start="561.879" dur="5.04">sudden would they have a change of heart</text>
  <text start="563.97" dur="4.569">think about it for a second if they</text>
  <text start="566.919" dur="4.17">raised rates I mean Europe is hurting</text>
  <text start="568.539" dur="4.681">right now if they raise rates what do</text>
  <text start="571.089" dur="4.95">you think would would happen to Europe</text>
  <text start="573.22" dur="4.469">it would fall apart but if we had an</text>
  <text start="576.039" dur="3.66">event and something else was going on</text>
  <text start="577.689" dur="4.32">and they raise rates they could blame it</text>
  <text start="579.699" dur="3.57">on something else right now they were</text>
  <text start="582.009" dur="4.8">exposed everyone&amp;#39;s looking at the</text>
  <text start="583.269" dur="6.66">central bank if they do anything to try</text>
  <text start="586.809" dur="5.34">to bring down the economy they&amp;#39;re out in</text>
  <text start="589.929" dur="3.75">the open it&amp;#39;s like the central bank</text>
  <text start="592.149" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re all standing in an open field</text>
  <text start="593.679" dur="5.07">and everyone is looking at them and if</text>
  <text start="596.799" dur="3.45">they do something everyone goes oh look</text>
  <text start="598.749" dur="3.84">he just raised his hand oh look they</text>
  <text start="600.249" dur="4.68">just did this we know exactly what</text>
  <text start="602.589" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re doing there they&amp;#39;re not hidden</text>
  <text start="604.929" dur="5.01">behind anything any type of an event or</text>
  <text start="606.939" dur="5.73">anything so they&amp;#39;re all out in the open</text>
  <text start="609.939" dur="5.07">and they know this this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="612.669" dur="4.47">being very careful or maybe they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="615.009" dur="4.651">being controlled well we know the</text>
  <text start="617.139" dur="4.38">Federal Reserve is and we know the ECB</text>
  <text start="619.66" dur="5.999">is not going to take a chance I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="621.519" dur="5.85">bringing down the entire world why</text>
  <text start="625.659" dur="3.51">because everyone would blame the central</text>
  <text start="627.369" dur="3.63">bank and then everyone would say well if</text>
  <text start="629.169" dur="3.6">that central bank did that why wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="630.999" dur="3.12">another central bank do this and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="632.769" dur="4.41">talking about the private ones central</text>
  <text start="634.119" dur="7.11">banks and this would not work out well</text>
  <text start="637.179" dur="7.74">for them China right now they just added</text>
  <text start="641.229" dur="7.17">to their gold reserves sixty point to</text>
  <text start="644.919" dur="7.681">six million ounces worth seventy nine</text>
  <text start="648.399" dur="7.62">point five billion dollars and if you</text>
  <text start="652.6" dur="6.87">look over time China is continually</text>
  <text start="656.019" dur="6.03">adding gold Russia is continually adding</text>
  <text start="659.47" dur="4.799">gold they&amp;#39;re protecting their wealth</text>
  <text start="662.049" dur="4.65">they know that this system will not last</text>
  <text start="664.269" dur="4.98">forever and eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="666.699" dur="5.37">happen the whole thing is going to fall</text>
  <text start="669.249" dur="5.79">apart now we talked about how do you</text>
  <text start="672.069" dur="5.401">bring down a central bank well you do it</text>
  <text start="675.039" dur="4.38">in stealth mode you do many things at</text>
  <text start="677.47" dur="5.279">once that don&amp;#39;t seem like they&amp;#39;re a part</text>
  <text start="679.419" dur="5.64">of the same thing and you just mention</text>
  <text start="682.749" dur="4.68">them and nobody is the wiser I think</text>
  <text start="685.059" dur="5.25">about 5g we just talked about that that</text>
  <text start="687.429" dur="4.891">supports a blockchain system a</text>
  <text start="690.309" dur="4.291">cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="692.32" dur="4.77">Burke you told us that gold is going to</text>
  <text start="694.6" dur="4.95">be bringing down the Fed now all they</text>
  <text start="697.09" dur="4.47">have to do is stop the manipulation and</text>
  <text start="699.55" dur="4.32">let gold rise they can&amp;#39;t let it happen</text>
  <text start="701.56" dur="4.59">right now because everyone would freak</text>
  <text start="703.87" dur="5.01">out so they have to let it happen slowly</text>
  <text start="706.15" dur="5.64">but surely and over time you will see</text>
  <text start="708.88" dur="6.69">this happening now gold is hovering</text>
  <text start="711.79" dur="5.7">around 20 1250 and 1350 we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="715.57" dur="4.26">start seeing it inch up it&amp;#39;s gonna go</text>
  <text start="717.49" dur="4.44">down it&amp;#39;s gonna move back up and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="719.83" dur="3.84">gonna see different things change and</text>
  <text start="721.93" dur="4.83">pretty soon we&amp;#39;re gonna see gold most</text>
  <text start="723.67" dur="4.98">likely hit 1400 and it&amp;#39;s gonna move up</text>
  <text start="726.76" dur="4.71">from there I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="728.65" dur="4.23">happen quickly because you don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="731.47" dur="3.72">the central banks you don&amp;#39;t want those</text>
  <text start="732.88" dur="6.93">people to understand what is happening</text>
  <text start="735.19" dur="6.9">just like with 5g the other way is many</text>
  <text start="739.81" dur="6.3">states right now they are passing</text>
  <text start="742.09" dur="6.36">legislation and this legislation is to</text>
  <text start="746.11" dur="4.38">allow precious metals to be recognized</text>
  <text start="748.45" dur="5.28">that&amp;#39;s gold and silver as currency</text>
  <text start="750.49" dur="6.51">within the state to allow the state to</text>
  <text start="753.73" dur="7.38">bypass the Federal Reserve so think</text>
  <text start="757" dur="7.25">about it you have 5 g or 6 g being</text>
  <text start="761.11" dur="5.85">pushed out there a blockchain system</text>
  <text start="764.25" dur="6.01">cryptocurrency that could be backed by</text>
  <text start="766.96" dur="6.24">gold you stop the manipulation on gold</text>
  <text start="770.26" dur="5.34">and you have all the states where most</text>
  <text start="773.2" dur="5.7">of the states pass legislation that</text>
  <text start="775.6" dur="5.91">allows gold and silver to be used as</text>
  <text start="778.9" dur="5.61">currency which bypasses the Federal</text>
  <text start="781.51" dur="6.57">Reserve Kansas right now introduced</text>
  <text start="784.51" dur="6.09">legislation HB 2 to 85 forcing the state</text>
  <text start="788.08" dur="5.04">of Kansas to recognize precious metals</text>
  <text start="790.6" dur="5.04">such as gold and silver as an official</text>
  <text start="793.12" dur="5.4">currency within the state now Kansas is</text>
  <text start="795.64" dur="7.82">not the only state we have South</text>
  <text start="798.52" dur="9.44">Carolina Tennessee Indiana Missouri</text>
  <text start="803.46" dur="8.71">Kansas City Oklahoma Texas Louisiana</text>
  <text start="807.96" dur="7.96">Wyoming Utah Arizona and I do believe</text>
  <text start="812.17" dur="7.62">there going to be more state coming on</text>
  <text start="815.92" dur="6.69">board and once you have the majority of</text>
  <text start="819.79" dur="6">states saying yes we will accept gold</text>
  <text start="822.61" dur="5.31">and silver that is currency and you can</text>
  <text start="825.79" dur="4.86">pay for things using gold and silver</text>
  <text start="827.92" dur="6.6">states will start to maybe purchase gold</text>
  <text start="830.65" dur="6.36">and silver and if you have 5g with the</text>
  <text start="834.52" dur="5.46">blockchain coming online you have an</text>
  <text start="837.01" dur="5.31">electronic system that you can use to</text>
  <text start="839.98" dur="6.81">separate yourself from the banking from</text>
  <text start="842.32" dur="8.1">the Federal Reserve System you also have</text>
  <text start="846.79" dur="6.66">the end of manipulation which allows</text>
  <text start="850.42" dur="6.66">gold to rise which would counter the</text>
  <text start="853.45" dur="6.99">Federal Reserve debt note all these</text>
  <text start="857.08" dur="5.4">little things are happening all at once</text>
  <text start="860.44" dur="5.15">at the same time</text>
  <text start="862.48" dur="6.06">Trump is working on getting rid of or</text>

  <text start="893.53" dur="5.31">are happening at the same time but it</text>
  <text start="896.41" dur="5.34">looks like they&amp;#39;re not connected but</text>
  <text start="898.84" dur="5.3">they are I mean think about what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="901.75" dur="5.22">doing with the deep state where he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="920.41" dur="6.87">together but they do everything all of</text>
  <text start="923.95" dur="6.51">this will come together at the end this</text>
  <text start="927.28" dur="6.42">is called military planning making sure</text>
