  <text start="38.15" dur="4.329">countries are isolating themselves as</text>
  <text start="40.65" dur="5.43">the private western central banking</text>
  <text start="42.479" dur="5.641">system collapses let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>

  <text start="54.299" dur="3.9">taking a lot of their cash out of the</text>
  <text start="56.07" dur="4.799">banks and as we know back in december</text>
  <text start="58.199" dur="5.221">about three billion has been withdrawn</text>
  <text start="60.869" dur="4.801">from the system now there are two banks</text>
  <text start="63.42" dur="5.699">there that kind of running out of cash</text>
  <text start="65.67" dur="5.939">and these banks have requested emergency</text>
  <text start="69.119" dur="5.311">liquidity assistance now we saw this</text>
  <text start="71.609" dur="5.461">back in 2011 when greece was having</text>
  <text start="74.43" dur="4.71">major problems and of course the central</text>
  <text start="77.07" dur="3.539">bankers stepped in and they gave them</text>
  <text start="79.14" dur="3.03">loans and then they gave him more loans</text>
  <text start="80.609" dur="2.76">and they gave more loans and here we are</text>
  <text start="82.17" dur="4.5">today and of course everything they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="83.369" dur="6.301">done did not work for greece actually it</text>
  <text start="86.67" dur="5.4">made it ten times worse and we also</text>
  <text start="89.67" dur="4.47">understand a lot of people are not</text>
  <text start="92.07" dur="5.159">paying their taxes in greece and we can</text>
  <text start="94.14" dur="5.759">see right now that banks are actually</text>
  <text start="97.229" dur="5.041">seeing bank runs because they need to</text>
  <text start="99.899" dur="3.841">continually add more and more cash to</text>
  <text start="102.27" dur="4.139">the system because a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="103.74" dur="5.58">taking it out and things are starting to</text>
  <text start="106.409" dur="4.17">crash and fall apart there and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="109.32" dur="4.2">going to have to see what happens on</text>
  <text start="110.579" dur="5.61">january 25th if they actually leave the</text>
  <text start="113.52" dur="4.32">euro or they stay with the euro and they</text>
  <text start="116.189" dur="3.78">write off a lot of their debt and we can</text>
  <text start="117.84" dur="3.51">see a lot of countries are looking at</text>
  <text start="119.969" dur="4.051">Greece to see what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="121.35" dur="5.159">because they might just follow I mean we</text>
  <text start="124.02" dur="4.4">see Iceland who had an application into</text>
  <text start="126.509" dur="4.231">the eurozone saying you know what I</text>
  <text start="128.42" dur="3.67">don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re going to join at this</text>
  <text start="130.74" dur="4.079">point and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="132.09" dur="6.119">countries starting to isolate themselves</text>
  <text start="134.819" dur="4.741">and step away from the private western</text>
  <text start="138.209" dur="2.141">central banking system because they</text>
  <text start="139.56" dur="4.93">realize</text>
  <text start="140.35" dur="7.32">this entire system is falling apart it</text>
  <text start="144.49" dur="5.1">is not getting better and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="147.67" dur="3.57">want to be a part of this and a lot of</text>
  <text start="149.59" dur="4.17">these countries and you have to remember</text>
  <text start="151.24" dur="4.47">if we go back and reports they have been</text>
  <text start="153.76" dur="3.83">protecting themselves they have made</text>
  <text start="155.71" dur="5.13">bilateral security agreements with China</text>
  <text start="157.59" dur="6.16">where they bring in reserve currency of</text>
  <text start="160.84" dur="5.25">the you wan remember and we can see they</text>
  <text start="163.75" dur="5.91">are getting prepared to drop the dollar</text>
  <text start="166.09" dur="5.22">drop the euro when it is time and we can</text>
  <text start="169.66" dur="3.63">see a lot of the countries right now are</text>
  <text start="171.31" dur="4.47">saying you know what we better do this</text>
  <text start="173.29" dur="4.92">at this point before things get worse</text>
  <text start="175.78" dur="5.07">now here in the United States we</text>
  <text start="178.21" dur="5.79">understand the government all they have</text>
  <text start="180.85" dur="5.4">is the illusionary numbers the stock</text>
  <text start="184" dur="5.04">market the suppressing of gold and</text>
  <text start="186.25" dur="5">silver and other precious metals we also</text>
  <text start="189.04" dur="4.2">understand they manipulate these</text>
  <text start="191.25" dur="4.62">statistical numbers this is all they</text>
  <text start="193.24" dur="5.22">have because the real economy is</text>
  <text start="195.87" dur="4.96">completely separating from their</text>
  <text start="198.46" dur="4.98">illusion and we can see that a lot of</text>
  <text start="200.83" dur="4.71">the people still believe that we are in</text>
  <text start="203.44" dur="3.78">recovery yes some are waking up and</text>
  <text start="205.54" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re saying something&amp;#39;s wrong but</text>
  <text start="207.22" dur="4.83">they have hope because the president the</text>
  <text start="209.71" dur="4.41">government the central bank they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="212.05" dur="3.63">continually telling them things are</text>
  <text start="214.12" dur="2.91">getting better believe us but and</text>
  <text start="215.68" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re brainwashing them over and over</text>
  <text start="217.03" dur="6.36">and over and the corporate media all you</text>
  <text start="219.46" dur="6.72">see is continually brainwashing the</text>
  <text start="223.39" dur="4.65">people with the economy&amp;#39;s doing great</text>
  <text start="226.18" dur="4.2">all the statistical numbers look</text>
  <text start="228.04" dur="4.38">fantastic so just believe us and we can</text>
  <text start="230.38" dur="6.66">see by the Yuma consumer sentiment it</text>
  <text start="232.42" dur="9.21">surged to 98.2 smashing the expectations</text>
  <text start="237.04" dur="7.07">of 94.1 by the most in two years this is</text>
  <text start="241.63" dur="6.09">the highest sentiment since februari</text>
  <text start="244.11" dur="7.24">2004&amp;#39;s all seems very odd especially in</text>
  <text start="247.72" dur="8.85">the light of how the holidays when the</text>
  <text start="251.35" dur="6.9">retail sales were awful people didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="256.57" dur="4.47">have the money to go out and spend but</text>
  <text start="258.25" dur="5.19">people believe they believe their</text>
  <text start="261.04" dur="4.71">salaries going to go up they believe</text>
  <text start="263.44" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re gonna get this better job they</text>
  <text start="265.75" dur="3.24">believe they&amp;#39;re going to sell their</text>
  <text start="267.88" dur="6.16">house I mean if we look at the</text>
  <text start="268.99" dur="8.21">statistics 55.2 percent they believe</text>
  <text start="274.04" dur="6.52">they&amp;#39;re going to get higher wages in the</text>
  <text start="277.2" dur="5.61">next year fifty-four percent of</text>
  <text start="280.56" dur="8.07">americans think it is a good time to</text>
  <text start="282.81" dur="8.07">sell their home and yeah it might be</text>
  <text start="288.63" dur="3.63">because prices are still up there but</text>
  <text start="290.88" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re coming down very quickly and</text>
  <text start="292.26" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;re starting to see that people are</text>
  <text start="294.33" dur="5.67">having a very hard time selling their</text>
  <text start="297.48" dur="5.91">house I believe that times where you</text>
  <text start="300" dur="7.5">sold your house kind of passed it we saw</text>
  <text start="303.39" dur="6.42">this back in 2007-2008 where there was a</text>
  <text start="307.5" dur="4.95">point where everything was fine and then</text>
  <text start="309.81" dur="3.66">it came to a screeching halt and people</text>
  <text start="312.45" dur="2.97">just couldn&amp;#39;t sell their homes anymore</text>
  <text start="313.47" dur="3.42">and the prices started to drop we are</text>
  <text start="315.42" dur="3.54">seeing that now now people are going to</text>
  <text start="316.89" dur="4.2">put their houses up for sale and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="318.96" dur="3.6">gonna wonder why isn&amp;#39;t my house selling</text>
  <text start="321.09" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re telling me everything is great</text>
  <text start="322.56" dur="3.48">people are buying what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="324.57" dur="4.32">and I looked around the country once</text>
  <text start="326.04" dur="6.24">again and I&amp;#39;m seeing houses on the</text>
  <text start="328.89" dur="7.2">market 60 90 120 days people are</text>
  <text start="332.28" dur="8.55">lowering their prices 50 75 thousand</text>
  <text start="336.09" dur="6.33">dollars they can&amp;#39;t move their homes but</text>
  <text start="340.83" dur="2.49">of course the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="342.42" dur="5.85">government is telling them that</text>
  <text start="343.32" dur="6.09">everything is fine they&amp;#39;re even telling</text>
  <text start="348.27" dur="4.17">them that there&amp;#39;s no inflation</text>
  <text start="349.41" dur="5.58">whatsoever everything all the prices are</text>
  <text start="352.44" dur="5.22">just going down and we see that the</text>
  <text start="354.99" dur="5.6">consumer prices have tumbled most in six</text>
  <text start="357.66" dur="5.97">years there is a point four percent drop</text>
  <text start="360.59" dur="4.96">slightly worse than expected this is the</text>
  <text start="363.63" dur="4.53">biggest monthly drop since december of</text>
  <text start="365.55" dur="5.1">2008 the drop is led by eight nine point</text>
  <text start="368.16" dur="4.83">four percent collapse month-on-month in</text>
  <text start="370.65" dur="3.96">gasoline now we understand that that</text>
  <text start="372.99" dur="4.41">which brings a lot of things down in</text>
  <text start="374.61" dur="4.74">price but when we look closer and we</text>
  <text start="377.4" dur="4.74">look at food food is a really great</text>
  <text start="379.35" dur="4.41">indicator because and I&amp;#39;m not talking</text>
  <text start="382.14" dur="3.39">about the box food all the chemical</text>
  <text start="383.76" dur="3.09">stuff where they can just create that</text>
  <text start="385.53" dur="4.98">out of thin air i&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="386.85" dur="6.75">natural food meets things that you just</text>
  <text start="390.51" dur="4.89">can&amp;#39;t manipulate in any way the food</text>
  <text start="393.6" dur="3.18">index rose point three percent in</text>
  <text start="395.4" dur="4.08">december and after eight point two</text>

  <text start="1314.68" dur="4.95">have this false flag event happen in</text>
  <text start="1316.78" dur="6">Paris and we see that people are scared</text>
  <text start="1319.63" dur="5.01">groups are scared and we see the Jewish</text>
  <text start="1322.78" dur="3.81">people are making a very big deal and</text>
  <text start="1324.64" dur="3.42">I&amp;#39;ve nothing against the Jewish people I</text>
  <text start="1326.59" dur="3.57">have nothing against Catholic people I</text>
  <text start="1328.06" dur="4.47">have nothing against Muslim people but I</text>
  <text start="1330.16" dur="4.95">find this very interesting that the</text>
  <text start="1332.53" dur="5.01">biggest Jewess association in the EU has</text>
  <text start="1335.11" dur="6.13">called on lawmakers in Brussels to let</text>
  <text start="1337.54" dur="5.77">Jewish people carry guns for protection</text>
  <text start="1341.24" dur="4.53">because what happened with the terrorism</text>
  <text start="1343.31" dur="4.26">with terrorists now I believe there</text>
  <text start="1345.77" dur="4.47">should be with everybody not just with</text>
  <text start="1347.57" dur="5.4">one group I mean think about what</text>
  <text start="1350.24" dur="5.42">they&amp;#39;re saying we have more and more</text>
  <text start="1352.97" dur="6.11">terrorism our governments are telling us</text>
  <text start="1355.66" dur="6.01">that terrorism is everywhere lone wolves</text>
  <text start="1359.08" dur="4.89">everyone should be scared we need to spy</text>
  <text start="1361.67" dur="5.91">on you we need to patch you down</text>
  <text start="1363.97" dur="5.98">wouldn&amp;#39;t it be a better idea if you gave</text>
  <text start="1367.58" dur="4.53">all the people weapons and they just</text>
  <text start="1369.95" dur="4.92">protect themselves think about how</text>
  <text start="1372.11" dur="7.26">everything else would go down if all</text>
  <text start="1374.87" dur="6.48">those people inside the deli or inside</text>
  <text start="1379.37" dur="3.39">any one of these locations where the</text>
  <text start="1381.35" dur="4.08">terrorists were holding them hostage</text>
  <text start="1382.76" dur="5.13">they picked out their guns and they</text>
  <text start="1385.43" dur="5.61">pointed it at the terrace what do you</text>
  <text start="1387.89" dur="5.79">think would happen all of a sudden we&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1391.04" dur="5.28">have a complete change of what was going</text>
  <text start="1393.68" dur="3.93">on at that point because you don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1396.32" dur="3.42">if the terrorist was going to kill you</text>
  <text start="1397.61" dur="3.92">or not now of course as we know this was</text>
  <text start="1399.74" dur="5.61">a false flag event i&amp;#39;m just using this</text>
  <text start="1401.53" dur="6.7">and saying this that we when we look at</text>
  <text start="1405.35" dur="4.46">certain towns that have very relaxed gun</text>
  <text start="1408.23" dur="6.27">laws and people can carry them around</text>
  <text start="1409.81" dur="8.29">crime is very low and we can see right</text>
  <text start="1414.5" dur="6.78">now that this is a great idea if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1418.1" dur="6.12">so worried about terrorism coming after</text>
  <text start="1421.28" dur="5.31">us it is a great idea for every single</text>
  <text start="1424.22" dur="5.58">person to protect themselves because as</text>
  <text start="1426.59" dur="4.56">we can see the government can&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1429.8" dur="6.06">though they&amp;#39;re telling us they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1431.15" dur="9.33">continually needing to spy to pat us</text>
  <text start="1435.86" dur="7.47">down to limit our free speech basically</text>
  <text start="1440.48" dur="5.55">none of this is working so we need to</text>
  <text start="1443.33" dur="4.5">have weapons now yesterday I talked</text>
  <text start="1446.03" dur="3.54">about this device called shot spotter</text>
  <text start="1447.83" dur="4.2">and these are microphones that they</text>
  <text start="1449.57" dur="5.19">place all over the place between</text>
  <text start="1452.03" dur="5.19">buildings and we see a lot of towns</text>
  <text start="1454.76" dur="4.83">cities getting involved with this and</text>
  <text start="1457.22" dur="4.65">this system detects gunshots in it</text>
  <text start="1459.59" dur="4.65">alerts the police and triangulate swear</text>
  <text start="1461.87" dur="3.69">this is happening and I was thinking</text>
  <text start="1464.24" dur="3.3">about this and yesterday I talked about</text>
  <text start="1465.56" dur="2.88">that they can change the microphones</text>
  <text start="1467.54" dur="2.7">where they can listen in on</text>
  <text start="1468.44" dur="3.51">conversations triangulate where people</text>
  <text start="1470.24" dur="3.57">are and they definitely going to use</text>
  <text start="1471.95" dur="2.76">this but I can see this device actually</text>
  <text start="1473.81" dur="4.02">not working</text>
  <text start="1474.71" dur="5.61">because there&amp;#39;s a very easy way to kind</text>
  <text start="1477.83" dur="5.52">of fool what is going on here and send</text>
  <text start="1480.32" dur="5.43">the police to a location where nothing</text>
  <text start="1483.35" dur="4.29">is happening let&amp;#39;s say someone has</text>
  <text start="1485.75" dur="4.14">fireworks and they start setting them</text>
  <text start="1487.64" dur="5.19">off in a certain area the police then</text>
  <text start="1489.89" dur="4.919">are going to run over there and try to</text>
  <text start="1492.83" dur="4.29">find out what was going on and at</text>
  <text start="1494.809" dur="4.891">meantime there&amp;#39;s a crime going on</text>
  <text start="1497.12" dur="5.309">someplace else so I can see how this</text>
  <text start="1499.7" dur="4.74">whole system can be fooled now they</text>
  <text start="1502.429" dur="5.791">might have some filters on there weird</text>
  <text start="1504.44" dur="6.27">say okay this is not a gunshot or maybe</text>
  <text start="1508.22" dur="4.86">it is and they might be able to</text>
  <text start="1510.71" dur="4.14">determine it but right now you know</text>
  <text start="1513.08" dur="3.599">between a firework and a gunshot</text>
  <text start="1514.85" dur="3.72">depending on where it is and how far</text>
  <text start="1516.679" dur="3.961">away it is they might not be able to</text>
  <text start="1518.57" dur="6.27">tell and people and the police might be</text>
  <text start="1520.64" dur="6.69">just running around all over town now</text>
  <text start="1524.84" dur="4.199">out in Ukraine we understand the economy</text>
  <text start="1527.33" dur="4.8">is collapsing the people are having a</text>
  <text start="1529.039" dur="6.181">very hard time out there war is still</text>
  <text start="1532.13" dur="5.22">going on the ceasefire really did not</text>
  <text start="1535.22" dur="3.48">work and we can see there is a huge</text>
  <text start="1537.35" dur="3.179">amount of troop build-up at this time</text>
  <text start="1538.7" dur="4.02">and we can see that thirty percent of</text>
  <text start="1540.529" dur="5.791">the Ukrainians didn&amp;#39;t have enough money</text>
  <text start="1542.72" dur="6.51">to pay their utility bills last month</text>
  <text start="1546.32" dur="5.7">this is how hard it is for these people</text>
  <text start="1549.23" dur="4.829">in this area and we can see there in the</text>
  <text start="1552.02" dur="3.899">middle of winter at this time and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1554.059" dur="5.97">getting harder and harder as time goes</text>
  <text start="1555.919" dur="6.51">on now we understand that the Donetsk</text>
  <text start="1560.029" dur="4.671">people and Kiev they&amp;#39;ve been meeting in</text>
  <text start="1562.429" dur="6.63">Minsk but guess what Kiev didn&amp;#39;t show up</text>
  <text start="1564.7" dur="6.43">they just didn&amp;#39;t come there and we can</text>
  <text start="1569.059" dur="7.531">see that the Donetsk people showed up</text>
  <text start="1571.13" dur="7.71">the OSCE showed up and Kiev did not show</text>
  <text start="1576.59" dur="4.14">up to the Minsk talks to talk about</text>
  <text start="1578.84" dur="3.6">peace and how they&amp;#39;re going to work out</text>
  <text start="1580.73" dur="3.48">the situation and how they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1582.44" dur="4.08">move forward so when you hear the</text>
  <text start="1584.21" dur="4.98">corporate media out there saying Russia</text>
  <text start="1586.52" dur="5.37">needs to stop this Russia has to</text>
  <text start="1589.19" dur="5.58">de-escalate the situation actually it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1591.89" dur="4.98">the opposite they&amp;#39;re not showing up to</text>
  <text start="1594.77" dur="4.649">the talks they&amp;#39;re not getting involved</text>
  <text start="1596.87" dur="4.289">instead what are they doing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1599.419" dur="4.38">building up their troops there training</text>
  <text start="1601.159" dur="4.471">their troops that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re busy</text>
  <text start="1603.799" dur="4.321">doing because they&amp;#39;re mounting an</text>
  <text start="1605.63" dur="4.8">offensive they&amp;#39;re getting ready now</text>
  <text start="1608.12" dur="3.48">understand in the Donetsk area there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1610.43" dur="3.54">an airport and they&amp;#39;ve been fighting</text>
  <text start="1611.6" dur="4.56">over this Airport there&amp;#39;s a huge amount</text>
  <text start="1613.97" dur="4.95">of shelling in this area now Kiev troops</text>
  <text start="1616.16" dur="7.53">are claiming that they still control the</text>
  <text start="1618.92" dur="7.08">area the southeastern people in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1623.69" dur="4.65">are saying no no we control the area now</text>
  <text start="1626" dur="5.1">so at this point I don&amp;#39;t see who</text>
  <text start="1628.34" dur="5.64">controls it and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="1631.1" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re both still in the area shelling</text>
  <text start="1633.98" dur="5.55">is continuing actually the donuts people</text>
  <text start="1636.62" dur="5.34">are saying I believe that the Kiev</text>
  <text start="1639.53" dur="4.95">government has been using chemical</text>
  <text start="1641.96" dur="3.93">weapons on us the head of the</text>

  <text start="1645.89" dur="4.89">republic alexander and on the try to</text>
  <text start="1648.5" dur="5.16">pronounce his name zach ahora chenko</text>
  <text start="1650.78" dur="4.26">said that Kiev troops have used chemical</text>
  <text start="1653.66" dur="3.48">munitions during the attacks on the</text>
  <text start="1655.04" dur="4.65">Donetsk Airport and we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="1657.14" dur="6.06">before where the US government central</text>
  <text start="1659.69" dur="7.2">bankers had the Syrian free syrian army</text>
  <text start="1663.2" dur="6.09">used sarin gas on the people of Syria</text>
  <text start="1666.89" dur="4.05">where the Free Syrian Army used chlorine</text>
  <text start="1669.29" dur="5.19">where the Islamic state which is the</text>
  <text start="1670.94" dur="5.94">proxy army use chlorine gas on the</text>
  <text start="1674.48" dur="5.37">people of Syria we&amp;#39;ve seen it before in</text>
  <text start="1676.88" dur="6.12">Ukraine where they used white phosphorus</text>
  <text start="1679.85" dur="5.7">where they use chemical weapons they</text>
  <text start="1683" dur="4.23">said after these shells burst a pungent</text>
  <text start="1685.55" dur="4.53">cloud of gas spread across the old</text>
  <text start="1687.23" dur="5.61">terminal and they said it smelled like</text>
  <text start="1690.08" dur="5.58">sulfur basically maybe they were trying</text>
  <text start="1692.84" dur="6.33">to make the whole place smelly and try</text>
  <text start="1695.66" dur="5.46">to get everyone to leave that area they</text>
  <text start="1699.17" dur="4.71">said there is there was a pungent smell</text>
  <text start="1701.12" dur="5.13">and they see burst of smoke in the air</text>
  <text start="1703.88" dur="3.75">and it was impossible to breathe so you</text>
  <text start="1706.25" dur="3.51">can see what they were trying to do at</text>
  <text start="1707.63" dur="4.98">this point and of course what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1709.76" dur="6.57">saying is that this breaches the Geneva</text>
  <text start="1712.61" dur="6.45">Convention this type of munition is</text>
  <text start="1716.33" dur="4.5">completely banned and they cannot be</text>
  <text start="1719.06" dur="6.81">using it but of course they do they</text>
  <text start="1720.83" dur="7.31">don&amp;#39;t care the Russian OSCE ambassador</text>
  <text start="1725.87" dur="4.65">saying there is absolutely no proof</text>
  <text start="1728.14" dur="4.93">substantiating Kiev&amp;#39;s allegations about</text>
  <text start="1730.52" dur="4.89">the presence of Russian troops and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1733.07" dur="4.43">seen this before in the past where they</text>
  <text start="1735.41" dur="4.26">were telling us that Russia was invading</text>
  <text start="1737.5" dur="3.94">continually they have tanks in there</text>
  <text start="1739.67" dur="2.22">they&amp;#39;re all over the place planes are</text>
  <text start="1741.44" dur="4.62">flying</text>
  <text start="1741.89" dur="7.8">helicopters and absolutely nothing Putin</text>
  <text start="1746.06" dur="6.72">came out and introduced a peace plan the</text>
  <text start="1749.69" dur="5.4">Minsk peace plan which Kiev is not</text>
  <text start="1752.78" dur="4.2">showing up to because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1755.09" dur="4.83">peace actually they took this time to</text>
  <text start="1756.98" dur="5.97">build up the troops to get there getting</text>
  <text start="1759.92" dur="5.48">the lethal weapons into the country so</text>
  <text start="1762.95" dur="5.85">you can see exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1765.4" dur="5.8">poroshenko is out there and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="1768.8" dur="4.77">that the Ukrainian army is regrouping in</text>

  <text start="1779.99" dur="5.64">force for reconstitution at the most</text>
  <text start="1782.66" dur="5.64">dangerous spots all of this alarms us</text>
  <text start="1785.63" dur="4.77">Lavrov says and he&amp;#39;s from Russia I hope</text>
  <text start="1788.3" dur="4.92">that Kiev will resort to common sense</text>
  <text start="1790.4" dur="5.19">and president poroshenko will not yield</text>
  <text start="1793.22" dur="4.65">two attempts of the war party to</text>
  <text start="1795.59" dur="5.85">sabotage the men&amp;#39;s agreements well he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1806.66" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re definitely getting ready now all</text>
  <text start="1808.73" dur="5.55">over the corporate media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1811.1" dur="5.4">spinning how Russia has shut off the gas</text>

  <text start="2092.139" dur="5.341">this way the oil the natural resources</text>
  <text start="2094.54" dur="5.04">will stay on the US dollar and this is</text>
  <text start="2097.48" dur="3.24">part of the agreement that yes if we go</text>

  <text start="2104.98" dur="5.19">not using the dollar and we can see</text>
  <text start="2107.44" dur="4.409">right now this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2110.17" dur="4.679">trying to do and the United Nations are</text>
  <text start="2111.849" dur="4.831">saying that the talks are going well the</text>
  <text start="2114.849" dur="4.201">only difference is and the only problem</text>
  <text start="2116.68" dur="4.77">is is that the representatives from the</text>
  <text start="2119.05" dur="5.37">self-declared government have really</text>
  <text start="2121.45" dur="5.58">stayed away from the talks so who are</text>
  <text start="2124.42" dur="4.02">they talking to it this time and we can</text>
  <text start="2127.03" dur="3.21">see right now they&amp;#39;re going to continue</text>
  <text start="2128.44" dur="4.5">the talks but I&amp;#39;m going to see we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2130.24" dur="4.89">going to see later on and as we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="2132.94" dur="3.72">in the past the US government the</text>
  <text start="2135.13" dur="5.13">central bankers they never keep their</text>
  <text start="2136.66" dur="6">word and fighting will then resume in</text>
  <text start="2140.26" dur="6.24">this area they&amp;#39;re trying to use this</text>
  <text start="2142.66" dur="5.939">as the first phase to get back into the</text>
  <text start="2146.5" dur="4.559">country and we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch</text>
  <text start="2148.599" dur="5.311">this closely to see how this goes now</text>
  <text start="2151.059" dur="5.671">there was a report in Libya that they</text>
  <text start="2153.91" dur="4.23">suspected a trawler was carrying fuel</text>
  <text start="2156.73" dur="3.18">and they said they were going to deliver</text>
  <text start="2158.14" dur="3.149">to the Islamic state I think the</text>
  <text start="2159.91" dur="3.659">opposite is happening here I think they</text>
  <text start="2161.289" dur="6.241">were trying to send it out and have</text>
  <text start="2163.569" dur="6">different countries purchase the oil not</text>
  <text start="2167.53" dur="5.25">using the dollar and we see Libyan</text>
  <text start="2169.569" dur="6.921">warplanes attacked it and it it was hit</text>
  <text start="2172.78" dur="8.4">and this oil now is not going to be sold</text>
  <text start="2176.49" dur="6.91">anywhere now we see out in Syria the</text>
  <text start="2181.18" dur="4.919">Pentagon is going to be deploying about</text>
  <text start="2183.4" dur="4.949">400 plus troops to train the Syrian</text>

  <text start="2195.73" dur="5.01">Washington takes its fight against the</text>
  <text start="2198.369" dur="4.141">Assad government and we can see this is</text>
  <text start="2200.74" dur="3.119">what they&amp;#39;re ramping up to do they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2202.51" dur="3.66">getting ready they&amp;#39;re getting prepared</text>
  <text start="2203.859" dur="3.42">and they&amp;#39;re pushing this as hard as they</text>
  <text start="2206.17" dur="4.02">possibly can now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="2207.279" dur="5.691">about the Free Syrian Army is that more</text>
  <text start="2210.19" dur="6.839">and more of the opposition forces are</text>
  <text start="2212.97" dur="6.629">basically moving over to the Islamic</text>
  <text start="2217.029" dur="5.371">state it was reported recently that some</text>
  <text start="2219.599" dur="4.96">3,000 so-called moderate rebels of the</text>
  <text start="2222.4" dur="4.56">Free Syrian Army had defected to the</text>
  <text start="2224.559" dur="4.56">Islamic state and of course they brought</text>
  <text start="2226.96" dur="4.649">all their weapons their cash the</text>
  <text start="2229.119" dur="4.44">equipment and training and we can see as</text>
  <text start="2231.609" dur="5.851">they train more of these opposition</text>
  <text start="2233.559" dur="7.23">groups how don&amp;#39;t they know that they</text>
  <text start="2237.46" dur="5.609">might kind of defect over to the Islamic</text>
  <text start="2240.789" dur="4.921">state now of course this might be</text>
  <text start="2243.069" dur="4.321">planned maybe this is what they want and</text>
  <text start="2245.71" dur="3.54">this way they can say ah look the</text>
  <text start="2247.39" dur="3.51">Islamic state is growing they have more</text>
  <text start="2249.25" dur="3.21">weapons they have more cash they have</text>
  <text start="2250.9" dur="4.649">more of everything and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2252.46" dur="5.069">maneuvering toward Damascus because we</text>
  <text start="2255.549" dur="5.371">can see from the time the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="2257.529" dur="8.161">got into Syria they have acquired more</text>
  <text start="2260.92" dur="6.869">land more of Syria and out of all the</text>
  <text start="2265.69" dur="5.399">bombing that they&amp;#39;re doing the Islamic</text>
  <text start="2267.789" dur="5.161">state is not damage whatsoever actually</text>
  <text start="2271.089" dur="4.381">they&amp;#39;re better off because as we know</text>
  <text start="2272.95" dur="3.43">they are a proxy army of the United</text>
  <text start="2275.47" dur="5.589">States government is</text>

  <text start="2283.67" dur="6.47">they want a no-fly zone they need it to</text>
  <text start="2287.029" dur="5.671">protect Aleppo from Assad forces and</text>
  <text start="2290.14" dur="4.36">they&amp;#39;re pushing for this once again and</text>
  <text start="2292.7" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re just trying to figure out how</text>
  <text start="2294.5" dur="3.9">they can get this no-fly zone they tried</text>
  <text start="2296.21" dur="3.96">many times before the Islamic state has</text>
  <text start="2298.4" dur="5.189">now captured three airplane three</text>
  <text start="2300.17" dur="4.8">fighter jets well Assad came in and blew</text>
  <text start="2303.589" dur="4.77">up the fighter jets while that story</text>
  <text start="2304.97" dur="5.94">disappeared the Islamic state now has</text>

  <text start="2312.5" dur="6.44">the Syrian army came in and took over</text>
  <text start="2316.309" dur="6.45">these air bases so every time they try</text>
  <text start="2318.94" dur="6.01">it kind of falls apart now of course</text>
