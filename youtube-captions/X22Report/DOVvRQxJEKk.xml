  <text start="46.09" dur="4.08">never ever ever taper they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="48.67" dur="3.6">keeping this out in front of the</text>
  <text start="50.17" dur="4.59">American public to keep up the illusion</text>
  <text start="52.27" dur="5.94">that things are really getting better</text>
  <text start="54.76" dur="5.49">the economy is recovering President</text>
  <text start="58.21" dur="4.83">Obama has Biden out there campaigning</text>
  <text start="60.25" dur="4.86">with other Democratic leaders letting</text>
  <text start="63.04" dur="6.09">everyone know we are on the right track</text>
  <text start="65.11" dur="6.36">hurrah and we understand that this is</text>
  <text start="69.13" dur="4.71">completely fake it is an illusion all</text>
  <text start="71.47" dur="4.23">the numbers are manipulated but they</text>
  <text start="73.84" dur="3.9">need to show everyone that things are</text>

  <text start="88.45" dur="5.489">continually buying up tons of mortgage</text>
  <text start="90.88" dur="5.76">toxic mortgages from the banks the banks</text>
  <text start="93.939" dur="3.75">are still pumping up the stock market</text>
  <text start="96.64" dur="4.26">from the money that they&amp;#39;re receiving</text>
  <text start="97.689" dur="5.881">forward for the toxic real estate so</text>
  <text start="100.9" dur="5.19">we&amp;#39;re really not seeing what they are</text>
  <text start="103.57" dur="5.369">saying but the rest of America who is</text>

  <text start="110.65" dur="5.49">the unemployment has dropped Wow</text>
  <text start="113.04" dur="6.31">everything is getting better and really</text>
  <text start="116.14" dur="6.6">this is a complete illusion because they</text>
  <text start="119.35" dur="5.97">have an event that is scheduled that is</text>
  <text start="122.74" dur="6.269">ready and they are going to use this</text>
  <text start="125.32" dur="6.57">event to show that the economy was</text>
  <text start="129.009" dur="5.941">getting better and all of a sudden this</text>
  <text start="131.89" dur="5.73">cyber attack this dirty bomb attack this</text>
  <text start="134.95" dur="4.98">chemical attack brought the United</text>
  <text start="137.62" dur="3.72">States to its knees it collapsed the</text>
  <text start="139.93" dur="4.04">recovery and</text>
  <text start="141.34" dur="5.85">now the Fed needs to step in again and</text>
  <text start="143.97" dur="5.799">increase QE and this is why they were</text>
  <text start="147.19" dur="6.39">out there saying that they might need to</text>
  <text start="149.769" dur="6.121">increase QE by 50% they are just laying</text>
  <text start="153.58" dur="4.59">the groundwork to let us know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="155.89" dur="4.459">really happening but don&amp;#39;t worry there</text>
  <text start="158.17" dur="6.179">are no bubbles being formed whatsoever</text>
  <text start="160.349" dur="7.121">Janet Yellen will let us know if there</text>
  <text start="164.349" dur="6.091">are any bubbles just like Bernanke did</text>
  <text start="167.47" dur="5.22">in 2008 you know they had the subprime</text>
  <text start="170.44" dur="4.44">contained that wasn&amp;#39;t a problem and he</text>
  <text start="172.69" dur="4.65">said this in 2008 the real estate market</text>
  <text start="174.88" dur="4.079">is fine it&amp;#39;s a little bit slowing right</text>
  <text start="177.34" dur="5.1">now but it looks like it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="178.959" dur="5.581">picking up and in 2008 don&amp;#39;t worry we</text>
  <text start="182.44" dur="4.53">are not forecasting any type of</text>
  <text start="184.54" dur="5.94">recession whatsoever and the stock</text>
  <text start="186.97" dur="6.239">market is no way in a bubble and housing</text>
  <text start="190.48" dur="6.569">is no way in a bubble either and they</text>
  <text start="193.209" dur="6.931">have said the same exact thing this time</text>
  <text start="197.049" dur="6.181">the only difference this time is that</text>
  <text start="200.14" dur="9.21">unemployment the real unemployment is</text>
  <text start="203.23" dur="10.229">around 25 percent this time the Fed is</text>
  <text start="209.35" dur="8.13">the entire market they are pumping it up</text>
  <text start="213.459" dur="6.301">with printing or creating money and</text>
  <text start="217.48" dur="4.74">pumping this into the banks the banks</text>
  <text start="219.76" dur="5.4">then are pumping this into the stock</text>
  <text start="222.22" dur="5.34">market the rest of the world like China</text>
  <text start="225.16" dur="6.449">Russia and other foreign nations are</text>
  <text start="227.56" dur="8.07">going in a different direction they are</text>
  <text start="231.609" dur="6.151">no longer using the US dollar they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="235.63" dur="3.96">see it as a benefit so what are they</text>
  <text start="237.76" dur="3.659">doing well they&amp;#39;re now buying anymore</text>
  <text start="239.59" dur="4.89">Treasuries actually they&amp;#39;re selling them</text>
  <text start="241.419" dur="7.111">so the Fed needs to pick up the Treasury</text>
  <text start="244.48" dur="5.759">bonds china is rejecting buying new</text>
  <text start="248.53" dur="4.829">treasury bonds so if they don&amp;#39;t buy them</text>
  <text start="250.239" dur="5.941">and the government is still borrowing</text>
  <text start="253.359" dur="5.25">and issuing treasury bonds someone&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="256.18" dur="4.44">to buy them and that is the Fed and a</text>
  <text start="258.609" dur="5.041">fit if the Fed keeps up the pace right</text>
  <text start="260.62" dur="5.13">now and I think it was the end of 2014</text>
  <text start="263.65" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;ll own half of the Treasury bond</text>
  <text start="265.75" dur="5.82">market and I think by 2018 I think I</text>
  <text start="268.33" dur="6.25">said or 2017 they will own the full</text>
  <text start="271.57" dur="5.95">Treasury market the Fed</text>
  <text start="274.58" dur="4.679">I mean the US government the central</text>
  <text start="277.52" dur="4.59">bankers are losing control over the</text>
  <text start="279.259" dur="4.891">Middle East so we understand that they</text>
  <text start="282.11" dur="4.5">are completely losing control and once</text>
  <text start="284.15" dur="4.38">these foreign nations figure out what is</text>
  <text start="286.61" dur="3.66">really happening and most of them</text>
  <text start="288.53" dur="3.24">understand what is happening and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="290.27" dur="5.639">why they&amp;#39;re making deals with China and</text>
  <text start="291.77" dur="6.329">Russia right now they will be sending US</text>
  <text start="295.909" dur="4.44">dollars they will be selling their</text>
  <text start="298.099" dur="4.59">Treasury bonds and all of that will be</text>
  <text start="300.349" dur="6.331">flooding back to the United States and</text>
  <text start="302.689" dur="5.73">this is where the problem will start but</text>
  <text start="306.68" dur="5.039">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="308.419" dur="5.521">news right now we see that Germany their</text>
  <text start="311.719" dur="5.1">industrial orders are down by two point</text>
  <text start="313.94" dur="5.25">two percent in October and what they are</text>
  <text start="316.819" dur="4.621">looking at as the foreign bookings that</text>
  <text start="319.19" dur="4.59">decreased by two-point-three percent and</text>
  <text start="321.44" dur="4.909">domestic order slip to two point O</text>
  <text start="323.78" dur="5.069">percent so Germany is feeling the same</text>
  <text start="326.349" dur="4.87">type of problems as the rest of the</text>
  <text start="328.849" dur="4.261">eurozone it took them a little longer to</text>
  <text start="331.219" dur="5.281">get into this but now they are</text>
  <text start="333.11" dur="7.109">unemployment is creeping up and the UK</text>
  <text start="336.5" dur="5.61">is also feeling this a lot of the UK</text>
  <text start="340.219" dur="5.01">people are diving into their personal</text>
  <text start="342.11" dur="6.239">savings to make ends meet and the</text>
  <text start="345.229" dur="6.631">eurozone is just plagued with high</text>
  <text start="348.349" dur="7.081">unemployment high debt and they are just</text>
  <text start="351.86" dur="5.669">drowning and they are in a recession /</text>
  <text start="355.43" dur="3.93">depression right now but again the</text>
  <text start="357.529" dur="3.721">propaganda is out there telling us that</text>
  <text start="359.36" dur="3.299">everything is fine that the recovering</text>
  <text start="361.25" dur="4.979">they&amp;#39;re coming out of the recession and</text>
  <text start="362.659" dur="6.361">everything looks a-okay so here in</text>
  <text start="366.229" dur="4.68">America what is happening is of course</text>
  <text start="369.02" dur="4.29">the unemployment has come down it was</text>
  <text start="370.909" dur="4.23">7.3 now it&amp;#39;s down to seven percent and</text>
  <text start="373.31" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re saying that things are just</text>
  <text start="375.139" dur="4.441">getting just better and and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="377.87" dur="3.96">recovering and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="379.58" dur="4.339">with and the Fed was out there today</text>
  <text start="381.83" dur="4.649">saying that they&amp;#39;re going to taper and</text>
  <text start="383.919" dur="4.3">things are looking really really well</text>
  <text start="386.479" dur="4.11">and they want to see if they can meet</text>
  <text start="388.219" dur="5.37">that six point five percent goal of</text>
  <text start="390.589" dur="5.67">unemployment and we have to see where</text>
  <text start="393.589" dur="3.841">these jobs are I mean let&amp;#39;s take a look</text>

  <text start="415.94" dur="5.25">people to handle and they hope that</text>
  <text start="418.31" dur="4.079">things are going to get better so and of</text>
  <text start="421.19" dur="4.44">course we have to remember that</text>

  <text start="441.289" dur="6.271">services and about 7,000 more physicians</text>
  <text start="444.889" dur="3.721">in the health care industry and we have</text>

  <text start="486.02" dur="5.16">people in the retail industry to handle</text>
  <text start="488.87" dur="4.5">the holiday rush and this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="491.18" dur="4.35">happening right now but we also have to</text>
  <text start="493.37" dur="5.1">look at the government they have hired</text>
  <text start="495.53" dur="9.98">around forty-one percent of new jobs in</text>
  <text start="498.47" dur="10.05">November and this new hirings of people</text>
  <text start="505.51" dur="6.01">really has nothing to do with small</text>
  <text start="508.52" dur="5.61">businesses or manufacturing or producing</text>
  <text start="511.52" dur="6.75">anything this is because the government</text>
  <text start="514.13" dur="7.86">is borrowing money they are need to make</text>
  <text start="518.27" dur="6.21">the illusion I continue the illusion in</text>
  <text start="521.99" dur="4.95">the industry and the they have the</text>
  <text start="524.48" dur="5.04">ability to hire people and you have to</text>
  <text start="526.94" dur="5.43">remember the government is borrowing</text>
  <text start="529.52" dur="5.64">money like there is no tomorrow and</text>
  <text start="532.37" dur="5.67">really it really is no tomorrow the way</text>
  <text start="535.16" dur="4.28">they&amp;#39;re doing it and we&amp;#39;re up to 17</text>
  <text start="538.04" dur="4.24">trillion</text>
  <text start="539.44" dur="6.21">this is just escalating as time goes on</text>
  <text start="542.28" dur="6.37">there&amp;#39;s not enough revenue to meet this</text>
  <text start="545.65" dur="5.45">debt and you know this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="548.65" dur="6">going to completely come tumbling down</text>
  <text start="551.1" dur="6.46">when everything when the free market</text>
  <text start="554.65" dur="4.95">actually realizes what&amp;#39;s going on the</text>
  <text start="557.56" dur="3.93">rest of the world you know starts going</text>
  <text start="559.6" dur="4.41">hey you know what this is getting out of</text>
  <text start="561.49" dur="5.1">hand here we don&amp;#39;t want the dollar we</text>
  <text start="564.01" dur="4.68">don&amp;#39;t want the Treasury bonds and all of</text>
  <text start="566.59" dur="5.31">a sudden the illusion starts crumbling</text>
  <text start="568.69" dur="5.97">apart and this is when everything starts</text>
  <text start="571.9" dur="6.18">to fall apart and we enter a collapse</text>
  <text start="574.66" dur="6.42">but we have to see what else is going on</text>
  <text start="578.08" dur="4.56">here the car in student loan account for</text>
  <text start="581.08" dur="3.81">ninety five percent of all consumer</text>
  <text start="582.64" dur="4.41">credit issued in the past year because</text>
  <text start="584.89" dur="5.4">we have to remember the central bank the</text>
  <text start="587.05" dur="5.7">system works by people borrowing and if</text>
  <text start="590.29" dur="4.05">people stop borrowing the system comes</text>
  <text start="592.75" dur="3.57">to a screeching halt so they need to</text>
  <text start="594.34" dur="4.77">they need people to borrow and since</text>
  <text start="596.32" dur="5.01">people are tapped out in the revolving</text>
  <text start="599.11" dur="5.49">credit you know credit cards they need</text>
  <text start="601.33" dur="6.96">to spur other other type of borrowing so</text>
  <text start="604.6" dur="6.65">what they did was they allowed subprime</text>
  <text start="608.29" dur="4.89">borrowers to borrow and purchase cars</text>
  <text start="611.25" dur="4.06">doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you have credit or no</text>
  <text start="613.18" dur="4.83">credit they needed people to do this so</text>
  <text start="615.31" dur="6.03">we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of borrowing in the</text>
  <text start="618.01" dur="5.67">car industry we&amp;#39;re seeing the lot of</text>
  <text start="621.34" dur="5.01">people purchasing homes even though</text>
  <text start="623.68" dur="5.04">mortgage applications of declined people</text>
  <text start="626.35" dur="4.2">have been purchasing homes because they</text>
  <text start="628.72" dur="4.5">can get a hundred percent financing I</text>
  <text start="630.55" dur="6.81">was recently during Thanksgiving at my</text>
  <text start="633.22" dur="7.11">cousins and they purchased a home in the</text>
  <text start="637.36" dur="5.729">area and when I drove into the</text>
  <text start="640.33" dur="6.03">development it was complete one hundred</text>
  <text start="643.089" dur="6.181">percent financing and this is how people</text>
  <text start="646.36" dur="5.22">are getting homes at this time and we</text>
  <text start="649.27" dur="5.19">have to remember the auto manufacturers</text>
  <text start="651.58" dur="5.16">are now channel stuffing and they are</text>
  <text start="654.46" dur="5.4">taking on a lot of inventory they have</text>
  <text start="656.74" dur="5.76">76 days of cars sitting on their Lots</text>
  <text start="659.86" dur="4.65">but the manufacturers are showing that</text>
  <text start="662.5" dur="4.8">they are producing and that&amp;#39;s why GDP is</text>
  <text start="664.51" dur="4.77">also up so we can see how this illusion</text>
  <text start="667.3" dur="5.349">all fits in and everything looks great</text>
  <text start="669.28" dur="7.839">but what&amp;#39;s strange is is that person</text>
  <text start="672.649" dur="6.06">income is continually falling and even</text>
  <text start="677.119" dur="2.76">though they&amp;#39;re showing that borrowing is</text>
  <text start="678.709" dur="2.401">up and then you know of course the</text>
  <text start="679.879" dur="3.9">corporate media is out there saying</text>
  <text start="681.11" dur="5.49">everything looks great borrowing is up</text>
  <text start="683.779" dur="7.86">people are spending it looks fantastic</text>
  <text start="686.6" dur="7.01">but this saving rate is plunging now we</text>
  <text start="691.639" dur="5.161">can see why this is happening because</text>
  <text start="693.61" dur="6.13">the real unemployment is not seven</text>
  <text start="696.8" dur="5.209">percent underemployment where people</text>
  <text start="699.74" dur="6.209">went from a full-time to a part-time job</text>
  <text start="702.009" dur="6.43">what is happening is people are not</text>
  <text start="705.949" dur="4.651">making the same amount of money or</text>
  <text start="708.439" dur="5.031">they&amp;#39;re not making money at all or</text>
  <text start="710.6" dur="5.669">they&amp;#39;re on unemployment insurance and</text>
  <text start="713.47" dur="6.33">since this is happening we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="716.269" dur="7.141">this savings rate goes down we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="719.8" dur="6.849">that their personal income is declining</text>
  <text start="723.41" dur="5.19">and you know of course the Fed the</text>
  <text start="726.649" dur="3.75">government they&amp;#39;re all expectations was</text>
  <text start="728.6" dur="3.719">since the unemployment is going down</text>
  <text start="730.399" dur="5.521">going down and more people are working</text>
  <text start="732.319" dur="6.96">they expected the personal income to go</text>
  <text start="735.92" dur="6.99">up by 0.3% but it declined by point one</text>
  <text start="739.279" dur="7.05">percent and the personal savings plunge</text>
  <text start="742.91" dur="6.149">of from five point two percent to four</text>
  <text start="746.329" dur="4.5">point eight percent so we can see why</text>
  <text start="749.059" dur="4.65">this is actually happening and if you</text>
  <text start="750.829" dur="6.06">look through all this we see we see a</text>
  <text start="753.709" dur="8.79">clearer picture of why the borrowing is</text>
  <text start="756.889" dur="8.43">happening we see why unemployment has</text>
  <text start="762.499" dur="5.19">come down to seven percent and again in</text>
  <text start="765.319" dur="4.44">december twenty eighth when the</text>
  <text start="767.689" dur="3.81">unemployment insurance runs out the</text>
  <text start="769.759" dur="6.02">extended unemployment insurance runs out</text>
  <text start="771.499" dur="6.63">we&amp;#39;re going to have 1.3 million drop off</text>
  <text start="775.779" dur="5.56">just like we&amp;#39;ve had many other people</text>
  <text start="778.129" dur="4.351">drop off and they won&amp;#39;t be counted so we</text>
  <text start="781.339" dur="3.031">have to see what the gut how the</text>
  <text start="782.48" dur="4.26">government is going to play this if they</text>
  <text start="784.37" dur="4.259">extend the unemployment insurance they</text>
  <text start="786.74" dur="4.05">will still count them and keep the</text>
  <text start="788.629" dur="4.77">unemployment the way it is if they drop</text>
  <text start="790.79" dur="6.18">off the unemployment is going to go from</text>
  <text start="793.399" dur="8.971">seven percent to like something like 6.5</text>
  <text start="796.97" dur="7.469">wow that is the feds goal and you can</text>
  <text start="802.37" dur="3.69">see how this is playing out and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="804.439" dur="7.081">going to have to see what has</text>
  <text start="806.06" dur="9.17">with with Congress and and how they vote</text>
  <text start="811.52" dur="7.68">on extending this unemployment and again</text>
  <text start="815.23" dur="6.4">they are discussing this and talking</text>
  <text start="819.2" dur="4.29">about extending it right now but nothing</text>
  <text start="821.63" dur="6.03">is set in stone and we&amp;#39;ll have to wait</text>
  <text start="823.49" dur="6.6">to see how this plays out now I talked a</text>
  <text start="827.66" dur="7.26">lot in my other reports about the yuan</text>
  <text start="830.09" dur="11.21">Hao it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s becoming more widely</text>
  <text start="834.92" dur="9.12">accepted it&amp;#39;s becoming a more of a</text>
  <text start="841.3" dur="4.42">currency that other countries want to</text>
  <text start="844.04" dur="3.08">use and right now the you want is now</text>
  <text start="845.72" dur="4.62">among the most actively traded</text>
  <text start="847.12" dur="5.77">currencies in the world as the Chinese</text>

  <text start="852.89" dur="4.74">the you want to flow across its borders</text>
  <text start="855.26" dur="4.44">to other countries now what they want to</text>
  <text start="857.63" dur="3.75">do is they want to expand what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="859.7" dur="4.29">already done we understand in Kenya</text>
  <text start="861.38" dur="6.33">there is a clearinghouse for the yuan we</text>
  <text start="863.99" dur="6.93">understand that the UK is allowing the</text>
  <text start="867.71" dur="5.6">Chinese to do a currency swap the</text>
  <text start="870.92" dur="4.98">Chinese banks are opening up in the UK</text>
  <text start="873.31" dur="6.1">Cameron has made a deal with the Chinese</text>
  <text start="875.9" dur="5.73">for a trade agreement and we see many</text>
  <text start="879.41" dur="4.65">other things happening with the yuan</text>
  <text start="881.63" dur="4.44">they are selling oil in the you want and</text>
  <text start="884.06" dur="4.32">you know the training of the yuan in</text>
  <text start="886.07" dur="6.45">global foreign exchange markets has more</text>
  <text start="888.38" dur="5.79">than tripled from three years ago so now</text>
  <text start="892.52" dur="3.63">they are making a run and the United</text>
  <text start="894.17" dur="5.49">States the central bankers see this and</text>
  <text start="896.15" dur="5.55">this is why China is a threat to the</text>
  <text start="899.66" dur="5.4">central bankers and this is why there</text>
  <text start="901.7" dur="6.21">has been a pivot to the pivot to Asia</text>
  <text start="905.06" dur="6.75">where the United States is encircling</text>
  <text start="907.91" dur="6.9">China because again if you do not have a</text>
  <text start="911.81" dur="5.28">western central bank you are an enemy to</text>
  <text start="914.81" dur="9.42">the central bankers and you are an enemy</text>
  <text start="917.09" dur="10.86">where they will start war to get their</text>
  <text start="924.23" dur="6.12">way and as the US dollar is continually</text>
  <text start="927.95" dur="4.77">imploding upon itself and the yuan is</text>
  <text start="930.35" dur="5.31">spraying out across the world the</text>
  <text start="932.72" dur="6.09">central bankers are becoming desperate</text>
  <text start="935.66" dur="3.96">and desperate people do desperate things</text>
  <text start="938.81" dur="4.26">and</text>
  <text start="939.62" dur="5.94">this is why war will eventually start</text>
  <text start="943.07" dur="6.06">because they will not let the system go</text>
  <text start="945.56" dur="6">they&amp;#39;d rather have war than it then have</text>
  <text start="949.13" dur="4.98">the system collapse and crumble from</text>
  <text start="951.56" dur="5.37">under them and their plan of course is</text>
  <text start="954.11" dur="7.05">to reset the system once the war is over</text>
  <text start="956.93" dur="6.27">and our duty is to make make certain</text>
  <text start="961.16" dur="3.44">that that doesn&amp;#39;t happen because our</text>
  <text start="963.2" dur="6.329">government the United States government</text>
  <text start="964.6" dur="7.66">can issue currency without the Federal</text>
  <text start="969.529" dur="6.241">Reserve System and they can issue the</text>
  <text start="972.26" dur="6.18">currency without interest it is written</text>
  <text start="975.77" dur="4.59">into the Constitution they are allowed</text>
  <text start="978.44" dur="4.14">to do this the United States has done</text>
  <text start="980.36" dur="4.29">this prior to nineteen thirteen but</text>
  <text start="982.58" dur="5.34">again the United States was taken over</text>
  <text start="984.65" dur="6.75">and compromised in 1913 and up to this</text>
  <text start="987.92" dur="6.3">point now since the since the</text>
  <text start="991.4" dur="4.77">unemployment rate has come down the Fed</text>
  <text start="994.22" dur="5.94">officials were out there saying that</text>
  <text start="996.17" dur="7.62">they need a clear plan to wind down QE 3</text>
  <text start="1000.16" dur="6.42">and to start the tapering process and we</text>
  <text start="1003.79" dur="5.1">heard this back in august and sep tember</text>
  <text start="1006.58" dur="4.53">where they needed the plan and they</text>
  <text start="1008.89" dur="4.319">needed to start unwinding and start</text>
  <text start="1011.11" dur="4.05">tapering and and things like that but</text>
  <text start="1013.209" dur="5.431">the event that they were expecting</text>
  <text start="1015.16" dur="6.15">didn&amp;#39;t happen and all of a sudden you</text>
  <text start="1018.64" dur="5.789">know things went completely the opposite</text>
  <text start="1021.31" dur="5.129">direction and here they are again trying</text>
  <text start="1024.429" dur="4.231">the same thing because they realize and</text>
  <text start="1026.439" dur="5.281">they understand that there is some type</text>
  <text start="1028.66" dur="6.48">of event going to uh that will occur and</text>
  <text start="1031.72" dur="8.359">it they will make their move and blame</text>
  <text start="1035.14" dur="7.919">it on another country now with Obamacare</text>
  <text start="1040.079" dur="5.591">Obamacare as everyone knows I do not</text>
  <text start="1043.059" dur="6.691">agree with iron it is not for the people</text>
  <text start="1045.67" dur="7.8">and I&amp;#39;ve said this many times in my</text>
  <text start="1049.75" dur="6.809">other reports and the Obamacare that the</text>
  <text start="1053.47" dur="5.43">website is a complete disaster and right</text>
  <text start="1056.559" dur="5.221">now there are additional glitches in</text>
  <text start="1058.9" dur="6.69">Obamacare in the website information is</text>
  <text start="1061.78" dur="7.32">not being transferred automatically to</text>
  <text start="1065.59" dur="4.87">other systems like other two to the</text>
  <text start="1069.1" dur="3.61">insurance</text>
  <text start="1070.46" dur="3.84">companies they are not getting the</text>
  <text start="1072.71" dur="4.11">information they are also not getting</text>
  <text start="1074.3" dur="4.83">their payment and people shopping for</text>
  <text start="1076.82" dur="3.9">insurance on the federal marketplace may</text>
  <text start="1079.13" dur="3.6">be informed they&amp;#39;re eligible for</text>
  <text start="1080.72" dur="3.84">Medicaid and that their information is</text>
  <text start="1082.73" dur="4.71">being sent to state officials to sign up</text>
  <text start="1084.56" dur="4.44">to sign them up however states say they</text>
  <text start="1087.44" dur="3.66">aren&amp;#39;t able to enroll them because</text>
  <text start="1089" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re not receiving any type or</text>
  <text start="1091.1" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re receiving incomplete data from</text>
  <text start="1094.04" dur="4.92">the Obama administration because what</text>
  <text start="1096.47" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;ve really done is they fix up the</text>
  <text start="1098.96" dur="3.48">front end of the website to make it look</text>
  <text start="1100.91" dur="3.75">really nice and look like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1102.44" dur="5.49">performing correctly but the backend</text>
  <text start="1104.66" dur="5.49">that does the heavy grunt work of moving</text>
  <text start="1107.93" dur="5.25">this information to the proper places is</text>
  <text start="1110.15" dur="5.22">not working at all there are many many</text>
  <text start="1113.18" dur="5.52">glitches and this is the heart of the</text>
  <text start="1115.37" dur="9.99">system and it is a complete disaster and</text>
  <text start="1118.7" dur="10.44">again Obamacare is a cash grab it is a</text>
  <text start="1125.36" dur="6.03">system where they can build tax revenue</text>
  <text start="1129.14" dur="4.41">from the people because if this was</text>
  <text start="1131.39" dur="4.95">truly for the people they wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1133.55" dur="6.56">penalize people if they didn&amp;#39;t want it</text>
  <text start="1136.34" dur="3.77">and they wouldn&amp;#39;t have to increase the</text>
  <text start="1140.32" dur="6.31">premiums and they wouldn&amp;#39;t have to make</text>
  <text start="1143.09" dur="5.58">these large deductibles because what</text>
  <text start="1146.63" dur="5.4">happens with these large deductibles is</text>
  <text start="1148.67" dur="6.3">it when you when you get a Obamacare</text>
  <text start="1152.03" dur="4.59">policy you go to the doctor if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1154.97" dur="3.87">spending six seven hundred dollars a</text>
  <text start="1156.62" dur="4.62">month premium you might have a five six</text>
  <text start="1158.84" dur="4.53">thousand dollar deductible you have to</text>
  <text start="1161.24" dur="4.89">pay the five six thousand dollars before</text>
  <text start="1163.37" dur="4.71">insurance even you know gives you</text>
  <text start="1166.13" dur="4.62">anything towards your visits and most</text>
  <text start="1168.08" dur="5.13">people don&amp;#39;t even reach the deductible</text>
  <text start="1170.75" dur="4.56">limits and they never even access any of</text>
  <text start="1173.21" dur="3.99">their insurance so they&amp;#39;re paying six</text>
  <text start="1175.31" dur="4.68">thousand a year for their deductible if</text>
  <text start="1177.2" dur="4.92">they meet it or whatever they meet up to</text>
  <text start="1179.99" dur="4.83">and they&amp;#39;re also paying for the premium</text>
  <text start="1182.12" dur="5.19">so you haven&amp;#39;t even received any of the</text>
  <text start="1184.82" dur="5.79">benefit from insurance whatsoever plus</text>
  <text start="1187.31" dur="5.55">the businesses are looking at this and</text>
  <text start="1190.61" dur="4.47">saying we&amp;#39;re cutting hours we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1192.86" dur="5.07">giving people insurance so if you have a</text>
  <text start="1195.08" dur="5.04">spouse on working in a company they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1197.93" dur="3.96">saying that their spouse needs to go to</text>
  <text start="1200.12" dur="3.65">the exchange to get insurance so now</text>
  <text start="1201.89" dur="3.29">you&amp;#39;re getting insurance from the</text>
  <text start="1203.77" dur="6.53">but he and you&amp;#39;re also paying for</text>
  <text start="1205.18" dur="8.31">insurance outside on the exchanges so</text>
  <text start="1210.3" dur="5.44">this is not a win-win for anyone the</text>
  <text start="1213.49" dur="4.56">only win win is the insurance companies</text>
  <text start="1215.74" dur="5.4">and the government because like I said</text>
  <text start="1218.05" dur="5.88">before when the government starts to tax</text>
  <text start="1221.14" dur="6.09">people more and more and continually</text>
  <text start="1223.93" dur="5.46">makes up new taxes we know we&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="1227.23" dur="5.13">end game because they cannot meet the</text>
  <text start="1229.39" dur="5.25">debt interest payments and this is why</text>
  <text start="1232.36" dur="3.63">they need the tax payment increased tax</text>
  <text start="1234.64" dur="4.53">payments and we see this happening in</text>
  <text start="1235.99" dur="6.42">France we see it happening in Italy we</text>
  <text start="1239.17" dur="6.09">see it in Greece we see it in Cyprus we</text>
  <text start="1242.41" dur="5.85">see it in the US and we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="1245.26" dur="6.99">a lot more of these taxes being pushed</text>
  <text start="1248.26" dur="6.66">upon the people now there was a army</text>

  <text start="1867.77" dur="5.85">in my other reports I&amp;#39;ve been showing</text>

  <text start="1876.62" dur="7.5">allow them to move into Syria and Iran I</text>
  <text start="1881.03" dur="6.18">mean already just a recap here we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1884.12" dur="5.61">seen that the UN report has come out</text>
  <text start="1887.21" dur="5.79">against Assad saying that he is</text>
  <text start="1889.73" dur="5.79">committed war crimes we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="1893" dur="5.46">back in Libya with Qaddafi and they use</text>
  <text start="1895.52" dur="6.3">NATO forces to invade Libya and to</text>

  <text start="1905.36" dur="4.41">Congress and the American people were</text>
  <text start="1907.04" dur="4.8">not for this so they&amp;#39;re using a</text>
  <text start="1909.77" dur="4.23">different approach we also understand</text>
  <text start="1911.84" dur="6.33">that cNN has reported that chemical</text>
  <text start="1914" dur="7.68">weapons are missing and there was an</text>
  <text start="1918.17" dur="5.07">Assad is keeping a cache of chemical</text>
  <text start="1921.68" dur="6">weapons that the UN does not know about</text>
  <text start="1923.24" dur="7.32">and just yesterday the Syrian rebels</text>
  <text start="1927.68" dur="5.7">said that Assad used chemical weapons on</text>
  <text start="1930.56" dur="5.31">people so they are spreading this</text>
  <text start="1933.38" dur="5.07">propaganda and also the United States</text>
  <text start="1935.87" dur="5.91">will be dumping the chemical weapons out</text>
  <text start="1938.45" dur="6.06">at sea using a United States shipped and</text>
  <text start="1941.78" dur="6.54">who knows some of that could end up back</text>
  <text start="1944.51" dur="7.05">here in the US so you can see how they</text>
  <text start="1948.32" dur="5.34">were pumping and planning to have some</text>

  <text start="1953.66" dur="8.13">everything up and again this is going to</text>
