  <text start="244.33" dur="5.34">seeing this not just in Cyprus we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="246.64" dur="6.629">also seeing this in Greece and also when</text>
  <text start="249.67" dur="5.789">you have such high unemployment it and</text>
  <text start="253.269" dur="5.011">people aren&amp;#39;t working and putting money</text>
  <text start="255.459" dur="6.541">back into the system and helping out the</text>
  <text start="258.28" dur="7.139">retail stores this cannot sustain itself</text>
  <text start="262" dur="6.539">and we&amp;#39;re seeing this in many many</text>
  <text start="265.419" dur="5.371">countries and this article goes on to</text>
  <text start="268.539" dur="4.171">say that the market is going to two tier</text>
  <text start="270.79" dur="4.56">read further and faster than before</text>
  <text start="272.71" dur="5.64">there is no lending available and</text>
  <text start="275.35" dur="6.75">people&amp;#39;s money is blocked plain and</text>
  <text start="278.35" dur="7.67">simple you can&amp;#39;t you know if that pretty</text>
  <text start="282.1" dur="8.13">much says it all now here in America</text>
  <text start="286.02" dur="6.88">we&amp;#39;re seeing many corporations reporting</text>
  <text start="290.23" dur="4.53">that their profits are down the</text>
  <text start="292.9" dur="5.37">companies aren&amp;#39;t doing well retail</text>
  <text start="294.76" dur="6.51">stores are closing retail is laying off</text>
  <text start="298.27" dur="4.59">people UPS came out saying the second</text>
  <text start="301.27" dur="4.83">quarter profits are down by four percent</text>
  <text start="302.86" dur="6.69">and that is a direct reflection of</text>
  <text start="306.1" dur="5.94">people not shipping plus which is part</text>
  <text start="309.55" dur="6.06">of their huge business businesses aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="312.04" dur="6.3">shipping and if they&amp;#39;re not shipping</text>
  <text start="315.61" dur="6">that just goes to show you that there</text>
  <text start="318.34" dur="7.35">are problems that I mean especially</text>
  <text start="321.61" dur="7.16">retail retail is probably a huge amount</text>
  <text start="325.69" dur="5.36">of business for UPS with shipping</text>
  <text start="328.77" dur="4.66">merchandise now if people are not</text>
  <text start="331.05" dur="3.7">purchasing as much as they used to</text>
  <text start="333.43" dur="4.08">because they don&amp;#39;t have the disposable</text>
  <text start="334.75" dur="4.74">income and the unemployment if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="337.51" dur="4.14">use the government calculation and you</text>
  <text start="339.49" dur="4.47">use the calculation back from night</text>
  <text start="341.65" dur="3.75">prior to nineteen ninety-four you know</text>
  <text start="343.96" dur="3.03">we&amp;#39;re looking at unemployment around</text>
  <text start="345.4" dur="3.93">twenty three percent or so and</text>
  <text start="346.99" dur="5.25">especially in the youth population which</text>
  <text start="349.33" dur="5.34">is very close to fifty percent we are</text>
  <text start="352.24" dur="6.14">not seeing people purchase on the</text>
  <text start="354.67" dur="6.33">internet and have their items shipped or</text>
  <text start="358.38" dur="4.72">they&amp;#39;re not shipping items and other</text>
  <text start="361" dur="5.67">businesses are not shipping items so</text>
  <text start="363.1" dur="5.73">we&amp;#39;re seeing this all over the place now</text>
  <text start="366.67" dur="3.99">I know that the government then the Fed</text>
  <text start="368.83" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re telling you everything is</text>
  <text start="370.66" dur="3.84">getting better we&amp;#39;re going to taper</text>
  <text start="372.37" dur="3.45">because the economy is getting better of</text>
  <text start="374.5" dur="3.87">course they&amp;#39;re doing it for another</text>
  <text start="375.82" dur="5.55">reason that&amp;#39;s they tell it to all the</text>
  <text start="378.37" dur="6.45">people who are listening to the</text>
  <text start="381.37" dur="5.46">mainstream media who where they you know</text>
  <text start="384.82" dur="4.47">tell everyone that everything&amp;#39;s okay and</text>
  <text start="386.83" dur="4.47">the Fed is going to start to pull back</text>
  <text start="389.29" dur="4.02">on the QE because the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="391.3" dur="4.38">so well well that&amp;#39;s not the real reason</text>
  <text start="393.31" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re pulling back on QE because</text>
  <text start="395.68" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re creating massive massive bubbles</text>
  <text start="397.93" dur="5.72">in the Treasury bond in the stock market</text>
  <text start="400.96" dur="2.69">in</text>
  <text start="404.139" dur="6.691">the student loan market because the Fed</text>
  <text start="407.8" dur="5.579">is the market today and they realize</text>
  <text start="410.83" dur="5.1">that this thing is building up too fast</text>
  <text start="413.379" dur="6.451">and they need to ease off a little bit</text>
  <text start="415.93" dur="6.63">because governments and the central</text>
  <text start="419.83" dur="8.07">banks are not prepared or not yet ready</text>
  <text start="422.56" dur="6.9">to let this thing go and even though</text>
  <text start="427.9" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re telling us that things are</text>
  <text start="429.46" dur="6.09">getting better we see that like in</text>
  <text start="432.61" dur="4.769">cities like Detroit where they have they</text>
  <text start="435.55" dur="3.57">filed the papers for bankruptcy enough</text>
  <text start="437.379" dur="4.921">of course you know people are fighting</text>
  <text start="439.12" dur="6.18">them on it that you know that that they</text>
  <text start="442.3" dur="5.04">have to prove that they need to go into</text>
  <text start="445.3" dur="5.459">bankruptcy but we see in other places</text>
  <text start="447.34" dur="8.22">like Chicago they&amp;#39;re firing around 2000</text>
  <text start="450.759" dur="8.22">school staff because of cuts and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="455.56" dur="8.879">closing schools now when an economy is</text>
  <text start="458.979" dur="11.22">doing well and things are prosperous we</text>
  <text start="464.439" dur="9.421">don&amp;#39;t close and fire people we expand</text>
  <text start="470.199" dur="5.87">because there&amp;#39;s more business and if we</text>
  <text start="473.86" dur="6.059">look around the world we see</text>
  <text start="476.069" dur="7.361">unemployment very high we see businesses</text>
  <text start="479.919" dur="5.881">laying off we see people having a very</text>
  <text start="483.43" dur="7.53">tough time finding work and when they do</text>
  <text start="485.8" dur="8.429">it&amp;#39;s a part time or two part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="490.96" dur="5.91">to make up the difference of the one job</text>
  <text start="494.229" dur="6.42">they had before and even so they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="496.87" dur="6.799">making the same amount of money and we</text>
  <text start="500.649" dur="5.25">are seeing this problem not just in</text>
  <text start="503.669" dur="6.78">corporations reporting their earnings</text>
  <text start="505.899" dur="7.911">we&amp;#39;re also seeing this in real estate</text>
  <text start="510.449" dur="5.83">the first time home buyers right now is</text>
  <text start="513.81" dur="6.789">kind of in a slump because you have to</text>
  <text start="516.279" dur="6.69">remember the youth population that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="520.599" dur="5.43">coming out of college in their 20s</text>
  <text start="522.969" dur="5.071">moving into the 30s normally they you</text>
  <text start="526.029" dur="4.411">know they get married they they look for</text>
  <text start="528.04" dur="4.2">a small house and they purchased this</text>
  <text start="530.44" dur="4.23">house because they have this job and</text>
  <text start="532.24" dur="5.83">they save their money but when the youth</text>
  <text start="534.67" dur="7.33">employment is so high and people can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="538.07" dur="6.54">get work coming out of college and the</text>
  <text start="542" dur="5.72">degree they want to study there is a</text>
  <text start="544.61" dur="5.79">problem and we&amp;#39;re seeing this now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="547.72" dur="6.52">typically couples in their late 20s or</text>
  <text start="550.4" dur="6.75">30s who historically have accounted for</text>
  <text start="554.24" dur="5.82">about forty percent of home sales that</text>
  <text start="557.15" dur="6.48">has dropped to around twenty five</text>
  <text start="560.06" dur="6.15">percent now so they are not driving the</text>
  <text start="563.63" dur="8.16">market anymore looking for that starter</text>
  <text start="566.21" dur="9.27">home what was driving the market was the</text>
  <text start="571.79" dur="8.82">hedge funds with government subsidies</text>
  <text start="575.48" dur="8.16">the REO to rent you know loans loading</text>

  <text start="834.17" dur="7.38">this in their calculation is absolutely</text>
  <text start="837.44" dur="7.2">ridiculous now we know that the debt</text>

  <text start="874.67" dur="5.52">to raise the debt ceiling and guess what</text>

  <text start="895.399" dur="4.081">they&amp;#39;ll raise it you know to last for</text>
  <text start="897.769" dur="4.351">let me see they&amp;#39;ll calculate it out like</text>

  <text start="912.14" dur="4.83">and then what they&amp;#39;re fighting about is</text>
  <text start="913.82" dur="4.74">ridiculous because guess what the debt</text>
  <text start="916.97" dur="4.53">is going to keep rising because they</text>
  <text start="918.56" dur="4.83">need the money to pay everything so all</text>
  <text start="921.5" dur="5.6">this arguing back and forth is</text>
  <text start="923.39" dur="7.8">meaningless the only way to stop this is</text>
  <text start="927.1" dur="6.67">just to stop spending period but if they</text>
