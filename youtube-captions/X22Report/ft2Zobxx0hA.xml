  <text start="33.67" dur="4.819">report my name is dave and this is</text>
  <text start="35.02" dur="5.82">episode 1001 and today&amp;#39;s date is jun 19</text>
  <text start="38.489" dur="4.901">2016 and the thought of the episode is</text>
  <text start="40.84" dur="4.649">the car and economic collapse news brief</text>
  <text start="43.39" dur="5.58">let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="45.489" dur="6.121">collapse news now we know that the</text>
  <text start="48.97" dur="4.229">economy is completely manipulated by the</text>
  <text start="51.61" dur="3.449">US government central bankers and we</text>
  <text start="53.199" dur="4.651">know the unemployment numbers are</text>
  <text start="55.059" dur="6.09">completely manipulated and sovereign</text>
  <text start="57.85" dur="6.059">investor and John Williams they dug deep</text>
  <text start="61.149" dur="5.281">into the BLS numbers and they were</text>
  <text start="63.909" dur="6.151">looking at the numbers and what they</text>
  <text start="66.43" dur="6.09">found out is that the BLS they inflate</text>
  <text start="70.06" dur="7.98">it&amp;#39;s their monthly account of new hires</text>
  <text start="72.52" dur="7.5">with about 200,000 fake jobs and this is</text>
  <text start="78.04" dur="3.75">including jobs conjured up by the</text>
  <text start="80.02" dur="4.02">birth-death model that are meant to</text>
  <text start="81.79" dur="5.46">account for new employment in starved</text>
  <text start="84.04" dur="6.39">companies that are too new to count now</text>
  <text start="87.25" dur="5.25">the fact that the BLS has been in an has</text>
  <text start="90.43" dur="3.479">been adding an average of two hundred</text>
  <text start="92.5" dur="5.4">thousand fake jobs to the monthly</text>
  <text start="93.909" dur="5.911">payroll in recent years and this is also</text>
  <text start="97.9" dur="4.37">confirmed by the March 2015 benchmark</text>
  <text start="99.82" dur="5.82">downside revisions that subtracted</text>
  <text start="102.27" dur="8.92">206,000 jobs the actual employment</text>
  <text start="105.64" dur="10.65">picture has become so weak they have</text>
  <text start="111.19" dur="9.3">been adding monthly upside biases so the</text>
  <text start="116.29" dur="6.38">bottom line is that the 4.5 million jobs</text>
  <text start="120.49" dur="5.78">announced during the Obama presidency</text>
  <text start="122.67" dur="6.819">never really existed they were</text>
  <text start="126.27" dur="6.67">statistical adjustments inserted into</text>
  <text start="129.489" dur="8.31">the data reflecting outdated historical</text>
  <text start="132.94" dur="7.56">ratios that no longer hold true and you</text>
  <text start="137.799" dur="6.391">don&amp;#39;t need to be a rocket scientist to</text>
  <text start="140.5" dur="9.209">figure this out because you can see how</text>
  <text start="144.19" dur="9.48">this is completely faked the fake</text>
  <text start="149.709" dur="7.711">employees cannot form the basis of a</text>
  <text start="153.67" dur="6">strong economy employers are not writing</text>
  <text start="157.42" dur="6.04">checks to employees that don&amp;#39;t exist</text>
  <text start="159.67" dur="9.06">outside of the statistical model</text>
  <text start="163.46" dur="11.15">federal personal tax receipts reflected</text>
  <text start="168.73" dur="10.3">state sales tax reflect it declining</text>
  <text start="174.61" dur="8.2">productivity reflects fake jobs so when</text>
  <text start="179.03" dur="9.24">we look at this millions of fake</text>
  <text start="182.81" dur="9.72">employees can&amp;#39;t do anything this is why</text>
  <text start="188.27" dur="5.85">we&amp;#39;re seeing the difference between what</text>
  <text start="192.53" dur="3.81">the government and the central bankers</text>
  <text start="194.12" dur="4.77">are telling us about how the job market</text>
  <text start="196.34" dur="4.73">is rebounding and when we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="198.89" dur="5.7">manufacturing industrial production</text>
  <text start="201.07" dur="6.19">we&amp;#39;re looking at retail we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="204.59" dur="5.34">the tax receipts this is why it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="207.26" dur="6.6">make sense because you can just fake it</text>
  <text start="209.93" dur="6.96">so far and this is exactly what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="213.86" dur="8.67">seeing they are completely making all of</text>
  <text start="216.89" dur="8.64">this up now out in the UK after the</text>
  <text start="222.53" dur="8.45">murder of MP joe cox we saw already</text>
  <text start="225.53" dur="9.48">there&amp;#39;s a petition on the UK website</text>
  <text start="230.98" dur="6.93">where they want to postpone the</text>
  <text start="235.01" dur="7.16">referendum or cancel the referendum and</text>
  <text start="237.91" dur="7.75">we can see that this whole thing was</text>
  <text start="242.17" dur="5.47">perfect timing because the vote comes up</text>
  <text start="245.66" dur="4.62">very soon I think it&amp;#39;s the 23rd of June</text>
  <text start="247.64" dur="4.86">and all of this is happening at the same</text>
  <text start="250.28" dur="4.59">time and they&amp;#39;re trying to reach the</text>
  <text start="252.5" dur="5.85">hundred thousand signatures as quickly</text>
  <text start="254.87" dur="4.83">as possible very interesting because all</text>
  <text start="258.35" dur="4.05">of a sudden the government will look at</text>
  <text start="259.7" dur="4.26">that and say you know what maybe we</text>
  <text start="262.4" dur="3.45">should cancel this and we&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="263.96" dur="3.42">to watch and see what happens there now</text>
  <text start="265.85" dur="4.14">a couple of weeks ago we know the</text>
  <text start="267.38" dur="5.04">enormity for the advisers have met and</text>
  <text start="269.99" dur="4.95">they own greed on the 11 principles of</text>
  <text start="272.42" dur="5.49">disengagement and on bass and what</text>
  <text start="274.94" dur="6.45">they&amp;#39;re saying right now is that Kiev</text>
  <text start="277.91" dur="6.48">must follow this and the principles by</text>
  <text start="281.39" dur="5.31">both sides must be implemented by July</text>
  <text start="284.39" dur="4.65">first and that&amp;#39;s only a week or two away</text>
  <text start="286.7" dur="4.92">and we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch that</text>
  <text start="289.04" dur="5.4">situation very carefully but something</text>
  <text start="291.62" dur="5.68">more interesting is that the Department</text>
  <text start="294.44" dur="7.479">of State they decided to update</text>
  <text start="297.3" dur="7.859">their travel warning in Ukraine and they</text>
  <text start="301.919" dur="7.74">update it and they included Crimea don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="305.159" dur="7.26">ask Lugansk and they&amp;#39;re saying that any</text>
  <text start="309.659" dur="5.94">US citizen in that area should now</text>
  <text start="312.419" dur="6.96">depart this supersedes any other travel</text>
  <text start="315.599" dur="6.54">warning in Ukraine and they were seeing</text>
  <text start="319.379" dur="7.29">the same exact warning that we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="322.139" dur="7.471">for the Middle East for Europe for the</text>
  <text start="326.669" dur="5.851">United States we&amp;#39;re seeing it in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="329.61" dur="5.25">and this is just another indicator and</text>
  <text start="332.52" dur="4.619">we&amp;#39;re continually seeing more and more</text>
  <text start="334.86" dur="5.69">indicators letting us know that</text>
  <text start="337.139" dur="5.791">something is about to happen here</text>
  <text start="340.55" dur="3.97">military assets are being moved into</text>
  <text start="342.93" dur="3.9">position we have two aircraft carriers</text>
  <text start="344.52" dur="5.699">in the Mediterranean with their Strike</text>
  <text start="346.83" dur="5.01">groups we see the two bases that the</text>
  <text start="350.219" dur="3.781">United States has built bringing in</text>
  <text start="351.84" dur="4.259">military assets and troops into the area</text>
  <text start="354" dur="4.469">Special Op teams from all different</text>
  <text start="356.099" dur="5.521">countries are there all these travel</text>
  <text start="358.469" dur="5.641">advisories we see out in Yemen right now</text>
  <text start="361.62" dur="4.349">the US military now plans to keep a</text>
  <text start="364.11" dur="4.109">force of special operation advisers in</text>
  <text start="365.969" dur="4.5">Yemen and they&amp;#39;re supposed to be only</text>
  <text start="368.219" dur="6.031">limited and for a short period of time</text>
  <text start="370.469" dur="5.461">well guess what they&amp;#39;re there for the</text>
  <text start="374.25" dur="4.65">foreseeable future there is no time</text>
  <text start="375.93" dur="5.82">limit and the Pentagon they dispatch</text>
  <text start="378.9" dur="4.639">another special operations team to Yemen</text>
  <text start="381.75" dur="4.139">now they&amp;#39;re on a separate mission</text>
  <text start="383.539" dur="5.171">they&amp;#39;re going to assess the security and</text>
  <text start="385.889" dur="6.39">size of the local figures who might</text>
  <text start="388.71" dur="5.609">cooperate with the United States the</text>
  <text start="392.279" dur="4.531">first Special Op team that was there</text>
  <text start="394.319" dur="5.46">sent temporarily they&amp;#39;re going after and</text>
  <text start="396.81" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re tracking down al-qaeda militants</text>
  <text start="399.779" dur="5.521">which really means those people who</text>
  <text start="402.33" dur="4.199">oppose the new government the puppet</text>
  <text start="405.3" dur="3.69">government i should say the puppet</text>
  <text start="406.529" dur="6.48">government in yemen and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="408.99" dur="7.289">to weed them out seek destroy get rid of</text>
  <text start="413.009" dur="6.571">them and we see already that the United</text>
  <text start="416.279" dur="6.331">States needs to retake the Middle East</text>
  <text start="419.58" dur="4.35">because if they don&amp;#39;t and they allow the</text>
  <text start="422.61" dur="3.809">people of these countries to take</text>
  <text start="423.93" dur="4.44">control they will kick out the central</text>
  <text start="426.419" dur="3.93">bank they will not sell the oil using</text>
  <text start="428.37" dur="2.759">the dollar and the dollar will collapse</text>
  <text start="430.349" dur="1.68">and</text>
  <text start="431.129" dur="3.06">is why they&amp;#39;re trying to maintain</text>
  <text start="432.029" dur="6.57">control by killing as many people as I</text>
  <text start="434.189" dur="7.52">possibly can in this area now we</text>
  <text start="438.599" dur="6.93">understand the UN back on jun 2nd</text>
  <text start="441.709" dur="5.83">decided to create this report about</text>
  <text start="445.529" dur="5.43">saudi arabia and they call that the</text>
  <text start="447.539" dur="6.42">child killers blacklist and they came up</text>
  <text start="450.959" dur="4.83">with this report saying that yes saudi</text>
  <text start="453.959" dur="4.651">arabia is killed in killing children</text>
  <text start="455.789" dur="5.48">they&amp;#39;re using cluster bombs and then all</text>
  <text start="458.61" dur="7.049">of a sudden un secretary-general</text>
  <text start="461.269" dur="6.25">announced that the regime was to be</text>
  <text start="465.659" dur="4.26">removed from the list pending further</text>
  <text start="467.519" dur="5.07">investigation he just backtracked on the</text>
  <text start="469.919" dur="4.8">whole entire thing and then we find out</text>
  <text start="472.589" dur="3.81">on Thursday that the House of</text>
  <text start="474.719" dur="4.081">Representatives voted against banning</text>
  <text start="476.399" dur="5.49">the transfer of cluster bomb munitions</text>
  <text start="478.8" dur="5.19">to Saudi Arabia so the sale is back on</text>
  <text start="481.889" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re going to be providing cluster</text>
  <text start="483.99" dur="4.769">bombs to Saudi Arabia now we have to</text>
  <text start="486.899" dur="4.05">remember cluster bombs remain ban by an</text>
  <text start="488.759" dur="4.68">international treaty signed by a hundred</text>
  <text start="490.949" dur="4.71">and nineteen countries except for the</text>
  <text start="493.439" dur="4.5">United States of course because American</text>
  <text start="495.659" dur="4.26">officials argue that the cluster bombs</text>
  <text start="497.939" dur="4.5">coming out of the United States they</text>
  <text start="499.919" dur="6.83">have special failsafe features where if</text>
  <text start="502.439" dur="7.95">a child picks up one of the unexploded</text>
  <text start="506.749" dur="5.76">munitions they won&amp;#39;t explode so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="510.389" dur="4.981">okay for us to do it but other countries</text>
  <text start="512.509" dur="7.41">they should not be able to do this very</text>
  <text start="515.37" dur="7.139">interesting now we understand the</text>
  <text start="519.919" dur="5.65">transitional government in Syria is</text>
  <text start="522.509" dur="5.13">supposed to occur in August first we</text>
  <text start="525.569" dur="3.39">know the United States government the</text>
  <text start="527.639" dur="4.05">central bankers the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="528.959" dur="5.48">they want Assad removed and the</text>
  <text start="531.689" dur="5.64">opposition right now the moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="534.439" dur="4.45">they refuse to participate in the</text>
  <text start="537.329" dur="6">formation of a national unity government</text>
  <text start="538.889" dur="7.44">in Syria if Assad is in power they will</text>
  <text start="543.329" dur="5.551">not be part of it whatsoever they will</text>
  <text start="546.329" dur="5.521">not attend any meetings and they will</text>
  <text start="548.88" dur="5.069">not deal with Assad now remember the</text>
  <text start="551.85" dur="5.099">only way to remove Assad is through the</text>
  <text start="553.949" dur="4.591">people but the United States they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="556.949" dur="3.961">want they don&amp;#39;t want this to happen this</text>
  <text start="558.54" dur="4.109">way they want to remove the elected</text>
  <text start="560.91" dur="3.69">leader themselves and put in the</text>
  <text start="562.649" dur="3.69">government they feel would be</text>
  <text start="564.6" dur="4.2">best government they did this in Libya</text>
  <text start="566.339" dur="5.161">they put in a government it was not</text>
  <text start="568.8" dur="3.99">elected they said this is good for the</text>
  <text start="571.5" dur="3.81">people and the people are saying no we</text>
  <text start="572.79" dur="4.529">don&amp;#39;t want this government the people in</text>
  <text start="575.31" dur="4.29">Yemen are saying we don&amp;#39;t want hottie</text>
  <text start="577.319" dur="5.19">and the puppet government in here we</text>
  <text start="579.6" dur="5.19">want our own government but you know for</text>
  <text start="582.509" dur="5.52">a nation that&amp;#39;s supposed to be free</text>
  <text start="584.79" dur="4.89">supposed to be democratic it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="588.029" dur="3.24">seem like they&amp;#39;re pushing this to other</text>
  <text start="589.68" dur="4.829">countries it seems like they&amp;#39;re deciding</text>
  <text start="591.269" dur="4.8">who the leaders are going to be now John</text>
  <text start="594.509" dur="3.361">Kerry is going to consider the military</text>
  <text start="596.069" dur="6.621">strikes against the Syrian government we</text>
  <text start="597.87" dur="7.38">know this letter came out with 50 or so</text>
  <text start="602.69" dur="5.769">diplomats from the State Department and</text>
  <text start="605.25" dur="6.12">we can see this is to create chaos and</text>
  <text start="608.459" dur="4.351">to make Obama look good so Obama is out</text>
  <text start="611.37" dur="3.269">there saying no I don&amp;#39;t want war with</text>
  <text start="612.81" dur="4.68">Syria I&amp;#39;m not going to put boots on the</text>
  <text start="614.639" dur="5.43">ground and then we see all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="617.49" dur="3.93">these 50 diplomats who want war and we</text>
  <text start="620.069" dur="3.871">can see what&amp;#39;s happening at this point</text>
  <text start="621.42" dur="4.95">Obama will look okay he wasn&amp;#39;t calling</text>
  <text start="623.94" dur="5.069">for war but we have to go to war the</text>
  <text start="626.37" dur="5.449">question is how were they going to do it</text>
  <text start="629.009" dur="5.7">how were they going to set this off</text>
  <text start="631.819" dur="6.19">because if you really think about it how</text>
  <text start="634.709" dur="5.82">does Obama move this forward well he</text>
  <text start="638.009" dur="4.89">would have to go to Congress he would</text>
  <text start="640.529" dur="5.221">have to make his case and they would</text>
  <text start="642.899" dur="5.161">have to vote on it and they would have</text>
  <text start="645.75" dur="5.13">to say okay we grant you the right to go</text>
  <text start="648.06" dur="5.24">to war is this going to happen most</text>
  <text start="650.88" dur="4.86">likely not not just out of the blue if</text>
  <text start="653.3" dur="5.26">the u.s. decides to go ahead and just</text>
  <text start="655.74" dur="5.49">attack without Congress&amp;#39;s permission the</text>
  <text start="658.56" dur="5.339">United Nations well that&amp;#39;s a problem</text>
  <text start="661.23" dur="4.95">there because Syria is a sovereign state</text>
  <text start="663.899" dur="4.8">with an elected president there is no</text>
  <text start="666.18" dur="4.529">mandate from the UN Security Council</text>
  <text start="668.699" dur="4.021">they will consider this a hostile act</text>
  <text start="670.709" dur="4.11">and a flagrant violation of</text>
  <text start="672.72" dur="4.77">international laws so this is another</text>
  <text start="674.819" dur="5.061">problem if they decide just to go ahead</text>
  <text start="677.49" dur="4.11">and attack there&amp;#39;s Russia and China</text>
  <text start="679.88" dur="2.86">where you know there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="681.6" dur="3.78">confrontation between these two</text>
  <text start="682.74" dur="5.699">countries so what are they going to have</text>
  <text start="685.38" dur="5.129">to do to push this forward well most</text>
  <text start="688.439" dur="4.411">likely they&amp;#39;re going to have to use some</text>
  <text start="690.509" dur="3.57">type of false flag they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="692.85" dur="2.789">to make it look like Turkey&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="694.079" dur="3.48">attacked they&amp;#39;re going to have to make</text>
  <text start="695.639" dur="2.791">it look like something happen in Syria</text>
