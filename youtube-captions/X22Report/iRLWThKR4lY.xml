  <text start="123.869" dur="5.31">video there let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="127.17" dur="6.59">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="129.179" dur="8.041">now we&amp;#39;ve been covering the Russian gate</text>
  <text start="133.76" dur="6.58">collusion hoax for quite a while now and</text>
  <text start="137.22" dur="6.29">we realize and if you notice you really</text>
  <text start="140.34" dur="6.929">don&amp;#39;t hear that much about it because</text>
  <text start="143.51" dur="6.58">the whole thing is completely fake but</text>
  <text start="147.269" dur="5.94">there is a new development in the</text>
  <text start="150.09" dur="5.63">Russian Gate investigation and this</text>
  <text start="153.209" dur="6.201">might completely blast apart</text>
  <text start="155.72" dur="7.51">one of the biggest hoaxes in history</text>
  <text start="159.41" dur="6.19">representative Dana Robb Bakker has met</text>
  <text start="163.23" dur="4.68">with Julian Assange this is the first</text>
  <text start="165.6" dur="5.91">u.s. congressman to do so in return with</text>
  <text start="167.91" dur="6.66">some spectacular news he said that</text>
  <text start="171.51" dur="5.729">Julian Assange told him that he can</text>
  <text start="174.57" dur="4.169">prove the leaked democratic party</text>
  <text start="177.239" dur="4.291">documents he published during the last</text>
  <text start="178.739" dur="6.181">year&amp;#39;s election did not come from Russia</text>
  <text start="181.53" dur="4.56">at all and promised additional helpful</text>
  <text start="184.92" dur="3.42">information about</text>
  <text start="186.09" dur="5.399">the leaks in the near future and of</text>
  <text start="188.34" dur="5.79">course what does Assange want he wants</text>
  <text start="191.489" dur="4.86">to be pardoned because he&amp;#39;s stuck in an</text>
  <text start="194.13" dur="4.5">embassy and he wants to leave and he</text>
  <text start="196.349" dur="5.311">wants to be able to travel so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="198.63" dur="4.859">trying to make a deal and he must most</text>
  <text start="201.66" dur="4.17">likely as we can see from all the leaks</text>
  <text start="203.489" dur="6.811">that he puts out there he must have</text>
  <text start="205.83" dur="7.439">certain information of who exactly it</text>
  <text start="210.3" dur="6.36">was now of course in the past we</text>
  <text start="213.269" dur="6.361">realized that we know who it was we know</text>
  <text start="216.66" dur="4.38">exactly how this happened because from</text>
  <text start="219.63" dur="3.6">all the evidence and from everything</text>
  <text start="221.04" dur="5.1">that has been researched we know that it</text>
  <text start="223.23" dur="4.65">was an inside job and most likely all</text>
  <text start="226.14" dur="4.11">the evidence is pointing to Seth rich</text>
  <text start="227.88" dur="5.25">and this is why they&amp;#39;re saying that he</text>
  <text start="230.25" dur="5.849">was murdered and of course what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="233.13" dur="6.24">seeing right now is that Julian Assange</text>
  <text start="236.099" dur="5.67">wants to tell all but he wants to be</text>
  <text start="239.37" dur="4.38">pardoned and we&amp;#39;ll see we&amp;#39;ll have to see</text>
  <text start="241.769" dur="4.05">how this plays out as we move forward</text>
  <text start="243.75" dur="5.31">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="245.819" dur="7.021">debbie Wasserman Schultz her ex IT aide</text>
  <text start="249.06" dur="8.399">well in Ron a1 he was indicted on four</text>
  <text start="252.84" dur="7.889">counts and so was his wife and he was</text>
  <text start="257.459" dur="5.611">part of this whole entire scandal and I</text>
  <text start="260.729" dur="4.021">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if this goes even</text>
  <text start="263.07" dur="4.8">further because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="264.75" dur="6.66">now is that the American Center for Law</text>
  <text start="267.87" dur="5.28">and Justice the ACLJ received the</text>
  <text start="271.41" dur="4.979">following letter from the FBI regarding</text>
  <text start="273.15" dur="6">its Freedom of Information request for</text>
  <text start="276.389" dur="6.121">any documents related to the Clinton</text>
  <text start="279.15" dur="5.79">Lynch tarmac meeting in June of 2016 now</text>
  <text start="282.51" dur="4.469">before the FBI said listen we have no</text>
  <text start="284.94" dur="5.07">records whatsoever we can&amp;#39;t give you any</text>
  <text start="286.979" dur="5.011">type of response because they&amp;#39;re just no</text>
  <text start="290.01" dur="4.11">records to be found but what has been</text>
  <text start="291.99" dur="3.45">happening since that period of time</text>
  <text start="294.12" dur="4.169">where they said they couldn&amp;#39;t find any</text>
  <text start="295.44" dur="6.449">record the Department of Justice now</text>
  <text start="298.289" dur="5.581">headed by Jeff Sessions well they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="301.889" dur="5.851">been providing numerous documents which</text>
  <text start="303.87" dur="8.69">include email traffic that has to do</text>
  <text start="307.74" dur="9.859">with Clinton with Lynch and now the FBI</text>
  <text start="312.56" dur="7.09">says well maybe we have some records and</text>
  <text start="317.599" dur="4.391">we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="319.65" dur="5.37">search a little bit further so what</text>
  <text start="321.99" dur="6.45">we&amp;#39;ll do is we&amp;#39;ll reopen the case to</text>
  <text start="325.02" dur="5.19">search those records which is very</text>
  <text start="328.44" dur="4.77">interesting because their response</text>
  <text start="330.21" dur="6.48">before was that there is absolutely no</text>
  <text start="333.21" dur="6.299">records what so after whatsoever so</text>
  <text start="336.69" dur="6.199">they&amp;#39;ve been caught hiding the truth</text>
  <text start="339.509" dur="6.511">from the American people and now the FBI</text>
  <text start="342.889" dur="4.691">because there was proof that there were</text>
  <text start="346.02" dur="4.53">record because the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="347.58" dur="7.11">had email which they got from where the</text>
  <text start="350.55" dur="6.17">FBI they have to reopen this now so this</text>
  <text start="354.69" dur="5.789">whole thing has just been reopened I</text>
  <text start="356.72" dur="5.47">mean it&amp;#39;s amazing when you look at this</text>
  <text start="360.479" dur="3.301">and of course through the alternative</text>
  <text start="362.19" dur="3.93">media and everyone out reporting on this</text>
  <text start="363.78" dur="4.199">saying oh no those people are crazy this</text>
  <text start="366.12" dur="5.18">is not real and all of a sudden you find</text>
  <text start="367.979" dur="6.541">out that yeah they were lying once again</text>
  <text start="371.3" dur="4.929">we see now that the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="374.52" dur="4.5">out there saying that Bannon was fired</text>
  <text start="376.229" dur="6.931">well actually it looks like Bannon</text>
  <text start="379.02" dur="7.89">resigned around two weeks ago but we</text>
  <text start="383.16" dur="6.41">could see that this is creating problems</text>
  <text start="386.91" dur="5.52">within the White House it&amp;#39;s creating</text>
  <text start="389.57" dur="6.31">hysteria with the corporate media like</text>
  <text start="392.43" dur="5.16">O&amp;#39;Bannon&amp;#39;s out and but is this part of</text>
  <text start="395.88" dur="6.569">the strategy because think about this</text>
  <text start="397.59" dur="6.42">for a second while Bannon was within the</text>
  <text start="402.449" dur="5.011">Trump administration he really couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="404.01" dur="6.98">say anything gana stayed quiet but now</text>
  <text start="407.46" dur="6.389">that he&amp;#39;s out and he looks like he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="410.99" dur="6.459">might be working maybe for Breitbart or</text>
  <text start="413.849" dur="7.591">some other news organization he might be</text>
  <text start="417.449" dur="7.611">able to actually tell everyone who is</text>
  <text start="421.44" dur="5.759">really working against Trump his agenda</text>
  <text start="425.06" dur="5.169">who are the individuals in the White</text>
  <text start="427.199" dur="5.551">House that are trying to push him out of</text>
  <text start="430.229" dur="5.041">the White House so this might be an</text>
  <text start="432.75" dur="5.039">actual benefit to the Trump</text>
  <text start="435.27" dur="4.95">administration now on the other side we</text>
  <text start="437.789" dur="5.611">can see as Bannon is being pushed out or</text>
  <text start="440.22" dur="5.069">he resigned and decided to leave there</text>
  <text start="443.4" dur="3.63">might be other problems within the White</text>
  <text start="445.289" dur="3.12">House because there are certain other</text>
  <text start="447.03" dur="3.9">individuals that are going to try to</text>
  <text start="448.409" dur="5.021">take control now we can see that right</text>
  <text start="450.93" dur="5.38">now everything is very chaotic</text>
  <text start="453.43" dur="4.38">the corporate media they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="456.31" dur="3.21">hear both sides to the story</text>
  <text start="457.81" dur="3.3">they just want to talk about white</text>
  <text start="459.52" dur="3.93">supremacists they just want to talk</text>
  <text start="461.11" dur="6.42">about Nazis they just want to talk about</text>
  <text start="463.45" dur="6.54">how Trump is a racist they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="467.53" dur="5.4">what he says how many times he denounced</text>
  <text start="469.99" dur="4.95">what has happened out in Charlottesville</text>
  <text start="472.93" dur="4.44">that makes no difference whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="474.94" dur="6.06">we can see there&amp;#39;s a lot of CEOs and</text>
  <text start="477.37" dur="5.94">other individuals saying listen we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="481" dur="4.26">be around this president right now and</text>
  <text start="483.31" dur="3.39">it looks like this has been completely</text>
  <text start="485.26" dur="3.72">set up and this is part of the elites</text>
  <text start="486.7" dur="4.41">plan this is part of their agenda to</text>
  <text start="488.98" dur="5.58">attack him and try to remove him</text>
  <text start="491.11" dur="8.67">remember the goal was always there to</text>
  <text start="494.56" dur="9.18">never allow Trump to finish his term the</text>
  <text start="499.78" dur="6.87">goal by the elite by the cabal was</text>
  <text start="503.74" dur="4.86">always to remove him any way they</text>
  <text start="506.65" dur="3.86">possibly can remember Republicans don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="508.6" dur="5.76">like him Democrats don&amp;#39;t like him and</text>
  <text start="510.51" dur="7.06">the elite definitely do not like him so</text>
  <text start="514.36" dur="6.18">we can see that CEO the council that he</text>
  <text start="517.57" dur="5.58">created these CEOs they&amp;#39;re basically</text>
  <text start="520.54" dur="5.82">going against him right now we see that</text>
  <text start="523.15" dur="5.28">CNN MSNBC all the corporate media</text>
  <text start="526.36" dur="5.46">outlets they&amp;#39;re out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="528.43" dur="5.67">just saying race you know white</text>
  <text start="531.82" dur="4.41">supremacist Nazis they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="534.1" dur="3.66">continually going on and on and on about</text>
  <text start="536.23" dur="3.84">this and then you have different</text>
  <text start="537.76" dur="3.81">government officials out there saying</text>
  <text start="540.07" dur="4.23">that we need to get rid of all the</text>
  <text start="541.57" dur="4.92">statues we need to erase the confederate</text>
  <text start="544.3" dur="5.76">names we need to erase the entire</text>
  <text start="546.49" dur="7.46">history of United States I mean part of</text>
  <text start="550.06" dur="6.93">it now of course burning books</text>
  <text start="553.95" dur="6.61">destroying statues getting rid of all</text>
  <text start="556.99" dur="6.3">this stuff doesn&amp;#39;t get rid of it yeah</text>
  <text start="560.56" dur="5.58">you might be able to hide it but it</text>
  <text start="563.29" dur="5.52">doesn&amp;#39;t remove the history I mean think</text>
  <text start="566.14" dur="6.06">about what they&amp;#39;re doing I mean as</text>
  <text start="568.81" dur="5.19">common sense completely left the</text>
  <text start="572.2" dur="4.65">American people I mean there&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="574" dur="5.34">people with common sense but if you</text>
  <text start="576.85" dur="4.08">listen to everyone nobody wants to have</text>
  <text start="579.34" dur="4.56">a rational discussion and this is part</text>
  <text start="580.93" dur="6.39">of the elites plan they want the tension</text>
  <text start="583.9" dur="7.38">they want both sides to fight against</text>
  <text start="587.32" dur="6.93">each other we as a people we need to</text>
  <text start="591.28" dur="7.02">come together not fight each other we</text>
  <text start="594.25" dur="7.02">need to point our finger at the real</text>
  <text start="598.3" dur="4.35">enemy but they don&amp;#39;t want this to happen</text>
  <text start="601.27" dur="4.77">and this is why they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="602.65" dur="5.4">pushing these ideas Pelosi is out there</text>
  <text start="606.04" dur="4.91">saying that we need to get rid of all</text>
  <text start="608.05" dur="5.34">the Confederate statues in the Capitol</text>
  <text start="610.95" dur="5.68">which is amazing we already have</text>
  <text start="613.39" dur="5.46">representative Steve Cohen well he is</text>
  <text start="616.63" dur="4.53">basically introducing articles of</text>
  <text start="618.85" dur="7.53">impeachment now this has happened before</text>
  <text start="621.16" dur="5.88">with Alan green and others where they</text>
  <text start="626.38" dur="4.95">submitted</text>
  <text start="627.04" dur="6.45">you know documents of impeachment and we</text>
  <text start="631.33" dur="4.05">can see this has been their plan from</text>
  <text start="633.49" dur="4.53">the very beginning now judge nala pathan</text>
  <text start="635.38" dur="4.95">oh he is out there and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="638.02" dur="7.43">listen we have to be very very careful</text>
  <text start="640.33" dur="7.8">about censorship about removing statues</text>
  <text start="645.45" dur="5.2">saying that you can&amp;#39;t read these books</text>
  <text start="648.13" dur="5.13">because they&amp;#39;re part of the history of</text>
  <text start="650.65" dur="6.63">the Confederacy he says the First</text>
  <text start="653.26" dur="6.48">Amendment restrains the government it</text>
  <text start="657.28" dur="4.82">reads Congress shall make no law</text>
  <text start="659.74" dur="4.74">abridging the freedom of speech and</text>
  <text start="662.1" dur="4.33">basically what we see government doing</text>
  <text start="664.48" dur="4.32">right now certain individuals in</text>
  <text start="666.43" dur="5.46">government well they want to ban certain</text>
  <text start="668.8" dur="5.43">things they want to hide certain things</text>

  <text start="713.53" dur="4.53">see and we have to understand where is</text>
  <text start="715.63" dur="5.63">this all coming from well it&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="718.06" dur="6.3">from those people who are in control</text>
  <text start="721.26" dur="4.329">now when these companies do this you</text>
  <text start="724.36" dur="2.52">know there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot of people</text>
  <text start="725.589" dur="4.491">out there saying oh this isn&amp;#39;t right</text>
  <text start="726.88" dur="5.16">and you&amp;#39;re going to see new sights new</text>
  <text start="730.08" dur="4">organizations start up that are going to</text>
  <text start="732.04" dur="6.54">compete against us we&amp;#39;ve seen this in</text>
  <text start="734.08" dur="9.06">the past this is nothing new but what</text>
  <text start="738.58" dur="7.8">the judge is saying is that hate speech</text>
  <text start="743.14" dur="7.97">or censorship which would you rather</text>
  <text start="746.38" dur="9.54">have and he says censorship is worse</text>
  <text start="751.11" dur="8.8">because what he is censor hate speech</text>
  <text start="755.92" dur="7.169">right now well you can deal with that</text>
  <text start="759.91" dur="4.92">and also the Constitution says free</text>
  <text start="763.089" dur="6.421">speech doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s hate</text>

  <text start="791.709" dur="7.891">what is good what is not it&amp;#39;s a very</text>

  <text start="799.6" dur="4.59">to agree with hate speech actually when</text>
  <text start="801.97" dur="4.14">there is hate speech it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="804.19" dur="4.47">better that is it that it that it&amp;#39;s out</text>

  <text start="815.89" dur="5.73">these individuals for what they really</text>
  <text start="818.08" dur="6.06">are now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>

  <text start="1369.01" dur="7.52">why did we do this but instead they have</text>
  <text start="1373.75" dur="6.42">us fighting against each other now Syria</text>
  <text start="1376.53" dur="5.77">is calling on the UN to force the United</text>
  <text start="1380.17" dur="4.95">States and his allies to cease bombing</text>
  <text start="1382.3" dur="4.41">civilians they&amp;#39;ve gone to the UN and</text>
  <text start="1385.12" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1386.71" dur="5.07">we&amp;#39;re filing this report that the US and</text>
  <text start="1389.74" dur="5.64">the coalition forces they are committing</text>
  <text start="1391.78" dur="5.76">war crimes in Syria and they have the</text>
  <text start="1395.38" dur="3.9">proof we see that Russia Turkey and Iran</text>
  <text start="1397.54" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re working on the escalation zones</text>
  <text start="1399.28" dur="5.7">in Syria right now it is in it Lib and</text>
  <text start="1401.98" dur="5.79">as the Syrian forces the Russian forces</text>

  <text start="1407.77" dur="4.11">from west to east</text>
  <text start="1409.63" dur="4.05">they are basically setting up the</text>
  <text start="1411.88" dur="2.97">escalation zones in every single area</text>
  <text start="1413.68" dur="3.57">because they&amp;#39;re liberating a lot of</text>
  <text start="1414.85" dur="4.89">cities a lot of towns and right now</text>
  <text start="1417.25" dur="5.31">Syria is saying listen the war is almost</text>
  <text start="1419.74" dur="5.58">over in Syria they&amp;#39;re already setting up</text>
  <text start="1422.56" dur="5.07">and bringing in Chinese investment</text>
  <text start="1425.32" dur="4.44">Russian investment they&amp;#39;re getting ready</text>
  <text start="1427.63" dur="5.19">to rebuild in all these different areas</text>
  <text start="1429.76" dur="5.67">the refugees are pouring back into Syria</text>
  <text start="1432.82" dur="4.44">and if we can do this with other nations</text>
  <text start="1435.43" dur="4.5">and we know that Libya is calling on</text>
  <text start="1437.26" dur="5.61">Russia we see other countries are</text>
  <text start="1439.93" dur="4.89">calling on Russia to come in and help</text>
  <text start="1442.87" dur="3.18">the situation to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="1444.82" dur="2.52">terrorist groups because what is</text>
  <text start="1446.05" dur="2.94">happening right now and we mentioned</text>
  <text start="1447.34" dur="3.03">this before the world is changing the</text>
  <text start="1448.99" dur="3.51">world is waking up saying wait a minute</text>
  <text start="1450.37" dur="3.96">Russia was able to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="1452.5" dur="3.6">terrorist groups while the United States</text>
  <text start="1454.33" dur="3.6">spent years and years and years and</text>
  <text start="1456.1" dur="4.08">couldn&amp;#39;t do anything so they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1457.93" dur="5.37">you know something we rather have Russia</text>
  <text start="1460.18" dur="6.24">and China help us than the United States</text>
  <text start="1463.3" dur="4.23">and this is what is happening and most</text>
  <text start="1466.42" dur="3.12">of the Middle Eastern countries are</text>
  <text start="1467.53" dur="5.16">saying we don&amp;#39;t want the United States</text>
  <text start="1469.54" dur="5.49">in our country any more we see there was</text>
  <text start="1472.69" dur="5.88">another terrorist attack in Barcelona</text>
  <text start="1475.03" dur="5.55">Spain and once again the chaos continues</text>
  <text start="1478.57" dur="4.35">a van hit you know many different</text>
  <text start="1480.58" dur="5.1">individuals some people were injured</text>
  <text start="1482.92" dur="5.25">some people died and we can see from</text>
  <text start="1485.68" dur="4.41">here in the United States like Wolf</text>
  <text start="1488.17" dur="4.22">Blitzer he&amp;#39;s saying oh look a copycat</text>
  <text start="1490.09" dur="4.41">terrorist attack just like the one in</text>
  <text start="1492.39" dur="4.3">Charlottesville and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1494.5" dur="6.24">basically bring this all in but this is</text>
  <text start="1496.69" dur="6.57">all chaos which we expected to see from</text>
  <text start="1500.74" dur="4.59">now into a Labor Day the elite are going</text>
  <text start="1503.26" dur="3.99">to push their agenda like you&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="1505.33" dur="4.92">seen before because it&amp;#39;s the time period</text>
  <text start="1507.25" dur="5.34">they love to play in and we can see</text>
  <text start="1510.25" dur="5.39">right now that they&amp;#39;re not going to give</text>
  <text start="1512.59" dur="7.07">up now very interestingly Russia</text>
  <text start="1515.64" dur="7.44">extended a hand to Spain Singh listen</text>
  <text start="1519.66" dur="6.75">if you need help combating terrorism we</text>
  <text start="1523.08" dur="6.69">will provide professionals that will</text>
  <text start="1526.41" dur="4.71">help with your problem and Russia is</text>
  <text start="1529.77" dur="3.18">doing this to many countries because</text>
  <text start="1531.12" dur="4.95">many of the countries have seen that</text>
  <text start="1532.95" dur="6.75">they are very successful in combating</text>
  <text start="1536.07" dur="6.06">terrorism and they get to the root of</text>
  <text start="1539.7" dur="5.34">the problem and they get rid of the</text>
  <text start="1542.13" dur="4.77">terrorists and we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="1545.04" dur="3.09">going to be a major problem from the</text>
  <text start="1546.9" dur="3.9">United States remember the world is</text>
  <text start="1548.13" dur="4.59">changing right now the world sees what</text>
  <text start="1550.8" dur="8.04">the elite have been doing for all these</text>
  <text start="1552.72" dur="8.7">years and this is the last push that the</text>
  <text start="1558.84" dur="4.65">elite pretty much have right now because</text>
  <text start="1561.42" dur="4.71">the Russian collusion thing is out the</text>
  <text start="1563.49" dur="5.1">window they need to get rid of Trump</text>
  <text start="1566.13" dur="5.34">they need to get back into power they</text>
  <text start="1568.59" dur="3.9">need someone in that seat and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1571.47" dur="2.37">think they&amp;#39;re going to stop with</text>
  <text start="1572.49" dur="3.03">impeachment I don&amp;#39;t know how far that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1573.84" dur="3.54">going to get but they&amp;#39;re going to push</text>
  <text start="1575.52" dur="4.71">this as hard as they possibly can and I</text>
  <text start="1577.38" dur="5.52">think the last thing they&amp;#39;ll try just</text>
  <text start="1580.23" dur="5.88">like they did with Kennedy they will try</text>
  <text start="1582.9" dur="6.84">to assassinate the president because</text>
  <text start="1586.11" dur="5.93">that&amp;#39;s all they&amp;#39;ll have left they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1589.74" dur="5.55">be able to use anything else because as</text>
  <text start="1592.04" dur="5.74">time goes on and people start to forget</text>
  <text start="1595.29" dur="5.01">people start to talk you can only keep</text>
  <text start="1597.78" dur="4.08">the propaganda going for so long yes</text>
  <text start="1600.3" dur="3.72">they might be able to keep it going for</text>
  <text start="1601.86" dur="3.42">a couple of weeks but eventually people</text>
  <text start="1604.02" dur="3.18">start to say you know I&amp;#39;m getting tired</text>
  <text start="1605.28" dur="3.33">of this I don&amp;#39;t want to keep this up</text>
  <text start="1607.2" dur="3.15">even though the corporate media will</text>
  <text start="1608.61" dur="3.3">keep going and going and going it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1610.35" dur="3.54">almost like the Russian collusion thing</text>
  <text start="1611.91" dur="3.54">they kept going but people started to</text>
  <text start="1613.89" dur="3.3">lose interest they didn&amp;#39;t care anymore</text>
  <text start="1615.45" dur="3.39">the same thing is going to happen with</text>
  <text start="1617.19" dur="4.11">Charles filled with removing the</text>
  <text start="1618.84" dur="4.8">Confederate statues moving all the names</text>
  <text start="1621.3" dur="4.77">and doing all this eventually what</text>
  <text start="1623.64" dur="4.98">happens is people get tired they go back</text>
  <text start="1626.07" dur="5.13">to their lives they stopped listening</text>
  <text start="1628.62" dur="4.5">because it just sounds like a broken</text>
  <text start="1631.2" dur="4.41">record after a while and when this dies</text>
  <text start="1633.12" dur="5.58">down this is when people need to get</text>
  <text start="1635.61" dur="4.56">nervous because I do believe that they</text>
  <text start="1638.7" dur="2.64">will get to the point where they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1640.17" dur="3.27">take it anymore and I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="1641.34" dur="4.98">the elite where they will try to</text>
  <text start="1643.44" dur="4.38">assassinate the president listen</text>
