  <text start="57.32" dur="6.809">report my name is Dave and sewed 1383</text>
  <text start="60.89" dur="5.88">bien today&amp;#39;s date is September 20th 2017</text>
  <text start="64.129" dur="5.27">and the thought of the episode is is the</text>
  <text start="66.77" dur="5.16">u.s. getting prepared to leave Syria</text>
  <text start="69.399" dur="5.11">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="71.93" dur="5.189">political and geopolitical news now</text>
  <text start="74.509" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about health coverage</text>
  <text start="77.119" dur="4.771">and Obamacare for quite a while and it</text>
  <text start="79.369" dur="4.68">is in a death spiral but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="81.89" dur="4.979">interesting about Obamacare is that the</text>
  <text start="84.049" dur="7.86">average cost of health coverage offered</text>
  <text start="86.869" dur="8.011">by employers it has now reached $19,000</text>
  <text start="91.909" dur="5.85">for a family plan this year this is</text>
  <text start="94.88" dur="6.36">about the same price as a you know low</text>
  <text start="97.759" dur="5.731">to mid range new car I mean this is just</text>
  <text start="101.24" dur="5.219">completely unbelievable of how expensive</text>
  <text start="103.49" dur="5.4">it is and we know that the premium</text>
  <text start="106.459" dur="4.651">prices for individuals has gone up quite</text>
  <text start="108.89" dur="3.81">a bit especially family plans who are</text>
  <text start="111.11" dur="3.959">people who are paying on their own and</text>
  <text start="112.7" dur="5.369">we see right now that this whole thing</text>
  <text start="115.069" dur="6.241">cannot be sustained Obamacare right now</text>
  <text start="118.069" dur="5.64">it is on the verge of collapse companies</text>
  <text start="121.31" dur="5.819">cannot afford it people cannot afford it</text>
  <text start="123.709" dur="5.851">and it&amp;#39;s getting out of it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="127.129" dur="4.89">out of reach for the everyday person in</text>
  <text start="129.56" dur="5.789">a lot of small companies they just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="132.019" dur="5.94">afford to pay these type of premiums it</text>
  <text start="135.349" dur="4.591">just doesn&amp;#39;t work in the business model</text>
  <text start="137.959" dur="3.931">and this is why a lot of these smaller</text>
  <text start="139.94" dur="5.31">companies are having a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="141.89" dur="6.06">problems trying to survive now out in</text>
  <text start="145.25" dur="4.379">Spain we know that a referendum is</text>
  <text start="147.95" dur="4.14">coming up very soon and it looks like</text>
  <text start="149.629" dur="4.321">the Spanish government is trying to stop</text>
  <text start="152.09" dur="4.38">this completely the Spanish police they</text>
  <text start="153.95" dur="4.92">arrested top-ranking Catalan officials</text>
  <text start="156.47" dur="5.549">including the region&amp;#39;s junior economy</text>
  <text start="158.87" dur="5.13">minister and it was a huge crackdown and</text>
  <text start="162.019" dur="3.841">they went along and they arrested these</text>
  <text start="164" dur="4.08">people they released them later on but</text>
  <text start="165.86" dur="4.739">it looks like they&amp;#39;re trying to push the</text>
  <text start="168.08" dur="4.11">agenda to say listen if you go forward</text>
  <text start="170.599" dur="4.441">with this we&amp;#39;re not gonna let it happen</text>
  <text start="172.19" dur="5.549">and at least a dozen high-ranking local</text>
  <text start="175.04" dur="4.559">officials were arrested and they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="177.739" dur="4.11">there protesting they&amp;#39;re saying no we</text>
  <text start="179.599" dur="3.9">want a referendum we want our</text>
  <text start="181.849" dur="3.03">independence and it looks like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="183.499" dur="1.761">going to happen we&amp;#39;ll see what happens</text>
  <text start="184.879" dur="2.571">with the</text>
  <text start="185.26" dur="3.899">random and how that turns out but it</text>
  <text start="187.45" dur="4.649">looks like they are definitely pushing</text>
  <text start="189.159" dur="4.53">in that direction we see Venezuela well</text>
  <text start="192.099" dur="4.23">it looks like they missed their</text>
  <text start="193.689" dur="4.621">September 15th interest payment on a</text>
  <text start="196.329" dur="3.511">hundred and eighty five million dollars</text>
  <text start="198.31" dur="3.84">right now looks like they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="199.84" dur="3.63">going into a 30-day grace period and we</text>
  <text start="202.15" dur="3.809">have to understand that Venezuela is</text>
  <text start="203.47" dur="4.17">under a huge amount of pressure the</text>
  <text start="205.959" dur="4.231">United States is placing a lot of</text>
  <text start="207.64" dur="4.5">sanctions on Venezuela we know Venezuela</text>
  <text start="210.19" dur="4.109">is in the process of moving away from</text>
  <text start="212.14" dur="3.719">the dollar moving towards the yuan and I</text>
  <text start="214.299" dur="4.101">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if maybe the BRIC</text>
  <text start="215.859" dur="5.011">nations come to the assistance of</text>
  <text start="218.4" dur="3.79">Venezuela and help them out and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="220.87" dur="3.089">have to wait and see and we can see</text>
  <text start="222.19" dur="4.59">right now that once they move away from</text>
  <text start="223.959" dur="4.68">the dollar all these sanctions and</text>
  <text start="226.78" dur="4.95">everything that&amp;#39;s been going on is going</text>
  <text start="228.639" dur="5.781">to be absolutely meaningless now we</text>
  <text start="231.73" dur="5.67">talked about sanctions on China and</text>
  <text start="234.42" dur="5.56">Treasury secretary Steve minuchin he is</text>
  <text start="237.4" dur="5">out there and he&amp;#39;s warning that the US</text>
  <text start="239.98" dur="5.429">may impose additional sanctions on China</text>
  <text start="242.4" dur="5.47">potentially cutting off access to the US</text>
  <text start="245.409" dur="4.681">financial system now we mentioned this</text>
  <text start="247.87" dur="4.979">before the United States is becoming</text>
  <text start="250.09" dur="5.97">very very worried about what China is</text>
  <text start="252.849" dur="5.401">doing with their trading system and this</text>
  <text start="256.06" dur="3.66">really has to do with the Cabal where</text>
  <text start="258.25" dur="2.609">they&amp;#39;re saying they cannot let this</text>
  <text start="259.72" dur="3.09">happen and this is why you hear</text>
  <text start="260.859" dur="3.691">sanctions floating around remember</text>
  <text start="262.81" dur="4.47">everyone still thinks that Trump is in</text>
  <text start="264.55" dur="4.44">charge but there&amp;#39;s many many of the deep</text>
  <text start="267.28" dur="3.66">state cabal still in charge of</text>
  <text start="268.99" dur="4.62">government pushing their agenda there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="270.94" dur="4.229">neocons there that want war and we can</text>
  <text start="273.61" dur="4.32">see that they&amp;#39;re not letting this go</text>
  <text start="275.169" dur="5.28">they will not give up they will fight to</text>
  <text start="277.93" dur="4.739">the very end just like in Syria where we</text>
  <text start="280.449" dur="3.331">see the Islamic state al Qaeda where</text>
  <text start="282.669" dur="3">they&amp;#39;re saying listen we&amp;#39;re gonna fight</text>
  <text start="283.78" dur="3.449">to the very end because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="285.669" dur="5.581">to give up what they&amp;#39;ve done think about</text>
  <text start="287.229" dur="6.72">it all these years they&amp;#39;ve been pushing</text>
  <text start="291.25" dur="5.37">their agenda to get a one-world</text>
  <text start="293.949" dur="4.44">government they&amp;#39;re part of the globalist</text>
  <text start="296.62" dur="3.84">system where they&amp;#39;re having regime</text>
  <text start="298.389" dur="4.791">change in all these countries and they</text>
  <text start="300.46" dur="5.639">wanted total control over everything</text>
  <text start="303.18" dur="4.63">everything right now is falling apart</text>
  <text start="306.099" dur="4.411">right in front of their eyes and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="307.81" dur="3.9">nothing they can do about it so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="310.51" dur="4.23">trying to do everything they possibly</text>
  <text start="311.71" dur="6.15">can to start some type of an event stop</text>
  <text start="314.74" dur="4.47">start a war play sections on China try</text>
  <text start="317.86" dur="4.679">to make them suffer</text>
  <text start="319.21" dur="5.37">at this point all these other countries</text>
  <text start="322.539" dur="3.781">they&amp;#39;re not suffering all they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="324.58" dur="3.75">is moving away from the dollar saying</text>
  <text start="326.32" dur="3.599">listen you can&amp;#39;t touch us now what do</text>
  <text start="328.33" dur="4.26">you think is going to happen with China</text>
  <text start="329.919" dur="4.56">if the United States places sanctions on</text>
  <text start="332.59" dur="3.57">China they&amp;#39;re gonna work with Russia</text>
  <text start="334.479" dur="2.91">they&amp;#39;re gonna work with Venezuela</text>
  <text start="336.16" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re gonna work with India they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="337.389" dur="4.071">gonna work with many other nations using</text>
  <text start="339.25" dur="5.16">their own currency using their own</text>
  <text start="341.46" dur="5.26">financial system because they created a</text>
  <text start="344.41" dur="5.19">duplicate financial system in their</text>
  <text start="346.72" dur="5.669">country they&amp;#39;re prepared for this plus</text>
  <text start="349.6" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;ve been amassing a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="352.389" dur="3.541">gold same with Russia same with many</text>
  <text start="354.46" dur="3.239">other countries the United States we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="355.93" dur="3.9">not too sure many people saying there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="357.699" dur="3.961">no gold here I know Steve minuchin was</text>
  <text start="359.83" dur="4.32">out there showing one bar of gold up</text>
  <text start="361.66" dur="4.289">staying that we do have gold this was</text>
  <text start="364.15" dur="3.199">just to make everyone feel confident</text>
  <text start="365.949" dur="4.141">that the United States does have gold</text>
  <text start="367.349" dur="4.721">but I think he didn&amp;#39;t check all the</text>
  <text start="370.09" dur="5.28">other rooms I think this was a publicity</text>
  <text start="372.07" dur="5.129">stunt to show that yes all that those</text>
  <text start="375.37" dur="3.96">conspiracy theories they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="377.199" dur="5.25">wrong because I&amp;#39;m holding one bar of</text>
  <text start="379.33" dur="5.55">gold we see the u.s. back Syrian</text>
  <text start="382.449" dur="4.021">democratic forces they are trying to</text>
  <text start="384.88" dur="4.59">advance towards the border with Syria</text>
  <text start="386.47" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re trying to capture the areas but</text>
  <text start="389.47" dur="3.81">I think at this point they&amp;#39;re a little</text>
  <text start="391.51" dur="3.51">late because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="393.28" dur="5.04">is the Syrian army the Russian forces</text>
  <text start="395.02" dur="4.92">they are liberating territory from the</text>
  <text start="398.32" dur="4.77">Islamic state along the Iraqi border</text>
  <text start="399.94" dur="5.25">along the Jordanian border Lebanon is</text>
  <text start="403.09" dur="5.699">pushing the Islamic state out and these</text>
  <text start="405.19" dur="6.9">moderate rebels the SDR they really</text>
  <text start="408.789" dur="5.94">don&amp;#39;t have the ability to fight against</text>
  <text start="412.09" dur="4.319">the Syrian armed forces and and the</text>
  <text start="414.729" dur="3.72">Russian forces they&amp;#39;re just sweeping</text>
  <text start="416.409" dur="4.711">right through but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="418.449" dur="6.601">interesting about all of this is that</text>
  <text start="421.12" dur="7.109">the u.s. might be ready to abandon its</text>
  <text start="425.05" dur="6">garrison on the Syrian border in the</text>
  <text start="428.229" dur="4.62">village of Al tamp and we know there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="431.05" dur="3.959">base there and it looks like they</text>
  <text start="432.849" dur="4.831">haven&amp;#39;t given a timeframe but it looks</text>
  <text start="435.009" dur="5.551">like the u.s. is acknowledging they will</text>
  <text start="437.68" dur="6.03">be leaving this area which basically</text>
  <text start="440.56" dur="5.609">shows us that they might be leaving</text>
  <text start="443.71" dur="3.389">Syria altogether now the Cabal doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="446.169" dur="2.881">want this to happen</text>
  <text start="447.099" dur="3.721">the intelligent agencies they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="449.05" dur="3.54">this to happen this is why they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="450.82" dur="4.67">trying to push their agenda</text>
  <text start="452.59" dur="4.17">in Syria but we mentioned this before</text>
  <text start="455.49" dur="3.37">Iraq</text>
  <text start="456.76" dur="3.69">pretty much said there&amp;#39;s no way there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="458.86" dur="6.63">going to be an independent Kurdistan</text>
  <text start="460.45" dur="6.9">region and we also see that Turkey which</text>
  <text start="465.49" dur="4.53">is now moving closer to Russia moving</text>
  <text start="467.35" dur="5.22">away from NATO Turkey is saying listen</text>
  <text start="470.02" dur="6.619">they&amp;#39;re going to impose severe sanctions</text>
  <text start="472.57" dur="8.01">upon Iraq or Syria if there is a</text>
  <text start="476.639" dur="7">Kurdistan section Russia right now is</text>
  <text start="480.58" dur="4.2">completely opposed to a Kurdish</text>
  <text start="483.639" dur="4.831">separatism</text>
  <text start="484.78" dur="6.48">in the Middle East Syria Assad is saying</text>
  <text start="488.47" dur="4.89">absolutely not the people will vote on</text>
  <text start="491.26" dur="4.71">it and we&amp;#39;re not just talking about the</text>
  <text start="493.36" dur="5.16">Select vote from the United States he</text>
  <text start="495.97" dur="4.71">says they will vote you know for the</text>
  <text start="498.52" dur="5.52">whole country if this needs to happen</text>
  <text start="500.68" dur="6.33">but we can see right now Assad brought</text>
  <text start="504.04" dur="6">them back you they assad brought in</text>
  <text start="507.01" dur="7.17">Russia Russia helped remove the Islamic</text>
  <text start="510.04" dur="7.02">state got rid of al-qaeda liberated</text>
  <text start="514.18" dur="7.65">village after village town after town</text>
  <text start="517.06" dur="6.029">and at this point I don&amp;#39;t think the</text>
  <text start="521.83" dur="3.48">people are gonna say you know something</text>
  <text start="523.089" dur="5.431">let&amp;#39;s give the Kurds their independence</text>
  <text start="525.31" dur="5.79">right now and we see that this is</text>
  <text start="528.52" dur="7.05">probably a no-go</text>
  <text start="531.1" dur="6.27">situation which tells us that the United</text>
  <text start="535.57" dur="4.59">States the Cabal that&amp;#39;s been trying to</text>
  <text start="537.37" dur="3.39">push this agenda they&amp;#39;re running out of</text>
  <text start="540.16" dur="2.58">options</text>
  <text start="540.76" dur="3.96">in Syria I think it&amp;#39;s just a matter of</text>
  <text start="542.74" dur="6.54">months before the United States</text>
  <text start="544.72" dur="6.24">completely is asked to leave this area I</text>
  <text start="549.28" dur="3.809">think Russia and Syria are gonna say</text>
  <text start="550.96" dur="5.84">listen it&amp;#39;s time and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="553.089" dur="6.811">making preps to abandon the AL tamp area</text>
  <text start="556.8" dur="6.46">abandon the garrison area along the</text>
  <text start="559.9" dur="7.98">border because they realize the game is</text>
  <text start="563.26" dur="7.8">over but the Cabal is not finished as of</text>
  <text start="567.88" dur="4.98">yet what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="571.06" dur="4.17">there&amp;#39;s this commercial that&amp;#39;s out there</text>
  <text start="572.86" dur="5.4">with Morgan Freeman and they are making</text>
  <text start="575.23" dur="5.43">this case saying that you know Russia is</text>
  <text start="578.26" dur="4.949">responsible Russia is cyber attacking</text>
  <text start="580.66" dur="4.23">Russia this Russia that and it looks</text>
  <text start="583.209" dur="2.581">like the intelligence agencies the Cabal</text>
  <text start="584.89" dur="4.89">there</text>
  <text start="585.79" dur="5.58">making a last-ditch effort to demonize</text>
  <text start="589.78" dur="4.17">Russia at this point and they</text>
  <text start="591.37" dur="5.1">specifically point out Putin saying that</text>
  <text start="593.95" dur="4.98">you know he rose from a Soviet power he</text>
  <text start="596.47" dur="5.85">took over Russia he cyber attacked the</text>
  <text start="598.93" dur="5.43">elections and he is an enemy of the</text>
  <text start="602.32" dur="3.42">United States but everything that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="604.36" dur="3.72">been following and everything that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="605.74" dur="4.59">been looking at he&amp;#39;s not trying to start</text>
  <text start="608.08" dur="4.11">a war every place the United States has</text>
  <text start="610.33" dur="6.3">gone into where a war would have broken</text>
  <text start="612.19" dur="8.85">out he&amp;#39;s actually presented a peace plan</text>
  <text start="616.63" dur="8.16">along with China and the United States</text>
  <text start="621.04" dur="5.37">the Cabal tried to fight this all along</text>
  <text start="624.79" dur="4.71">now the reason why they&amp;#39;re going after</text>
  <text start="626.41" dur="7.14">Putin is because he took control of the</text>
  <text start="629.5" dur="7.32">private western central bank so the</text>
  <text start="633.55" dur="5.01">country of Russia now controls the</text>

  <text start="651.19" dur="4.53">going through Hollywood and this is what</text>
  <text start="653.89" dur="5.28">they normally do they&amp;#39;re pushing the</text>
  <text start="655.72" dur="5.28">agenda to make us believe that Russia is</text>

  <text start="680.95" dur="5.49">airtime to this commercial because they</text>
  <text start="683.89" dur="5.46">want this message repeated over and over</text>
  <text start="686.44" dur="6.21">and over to make everyone believe that</text>
  <text start="689.35" dur="4.68">yeah Russia is the enemy and the reason</text>
  <text start="692.65" dur="4.02">for this is because they know that</text>
  <text start="694.03" dur="5.15">listen the system is coming down we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="696.67" dur="7.41">running out of time the economy is just</text>

  <text start="704.08" dur="4.32">can&amp;#39;t have it come down without some</text>
  <text start="706.39" dur="3.75">type of an event because everyone would</text>
  <text start="708.4" dur="2.88">turn and point the finger at the central</text>
  <text start="710.14" dur="3.57">bank because think about what the</text>

  <text start="719.35" dur="6.24">just rates employment looks fantastic</text>

  <text start="725.59" dur="6.24">want to bring it up a little bit if the</text>
  <text start="728.26" dur="6.29">economy falls apart right now well</text>
  <text start="731.83" dur="5.75">everyone&amp;#39;s gonna realize they lied</text>
  <text start="734.55" dur="7.03">because how did it fall apart if</text>
  <text start="737.58" dur="5.59">everything is fine it makes no sense so</text>
  <text start="741.58" dur="3.51">what do they need they need some type of</text>
  <text start="743.17" dur="4.68">an event this is why we see the</text>
  <text start="745.09" dur="5.16">propaganda happening right now we know</text>
  <text start="747.85" dur="5.43">the best way to bring down the economy</text>
  <text start="750.25" dur="4.74">is to have some type of cyber war you</text>
  <text start="753.28" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t have to show proof you can just</text>
  <text start="754.99" dur="4.71">say there was a cyber attack hitting the</text>
  <text start="757.78" dur="3.77">financial institutions they can shut</text>
  <text start="759.7" dur="4.53">down the financial institutions and</text>
  <text start="761.55" dur="5.56">pretty much most of the people around</text>
  <text start="764.23" dur="5.19">America will believe them I mean think</text>
  <text start="767.11" dur="4.71">about this talk to people and ask who</text>
  <text start="769.42" dur="4.53">was responsible for the Sony hack most</text>
  <text start="771.82" dur="4.92">people will say North Korea I mean there</text>
  <text start="773.95" dur="4.29">was no proof they just went out there</text>
  <text start="776.74" dur="5.07">and they used propaganda but we know it</text>
  <text start="778.24" dur="5.61">was someone from and that was internal</text>
  <text start="781.81" dur="5.34">to Sony that was a disgruntled worker</text>
  <text start="783.85" dur="5.13">and this person went ahead and leaked</text>
  <text start="787.15" dur="3.18">all this information but they wanted to</text>
  <text start="788.98" dur="3.69">blame North Korea and they did this very</text>
  <text start="790.33" dur="4.02">very quickly and they tried to cover up</text>
  <text start="792.67" dur="3.18">what was really going on there because</text>
  <text start="794.35" dur="3.51">what they try to do is they try to</text>
  <text start="795.85" dur="3.89">demonize these countries to say listen</text>
  <text start="797.86" dur="5.13">they have the ability to do these things</text>
  <text start="799.74" dur="5.08">now what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="802.99" dur="4.11">trying to show that Russia does have the</text>
  <text start="804.82" dur="4.56">ability Putin is the enemy Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="807.1" dur="6.03">getting ready to attack the question is</text>
  <text start="809.38" dur="5.52">why would they do this more and more</text>
  <text start="813.13" dur="3.75">countries are joining the BRICS system</text>
  <text start="814.9" dur="5.01">more and more countries are joining the</text>
  <text start="816.88" dur="5.58">one belt one road system Russia has been</text>

  <text start="855.76" dur="4.32">there&amp;#39;s no reason to do this the only</text>
  <text start="857.56" dur="5.82">reason they&amp;#39;re pushing this propaganda</text>
  <text start="860.08" dur="5.64">is because they don&amp;#39;t want anyone to</text>
