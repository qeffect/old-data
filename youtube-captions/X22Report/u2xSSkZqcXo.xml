  <text start="61.71" dur="6.06">hindenburg omen morning let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="64.739" dur="5.49">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="67.77" dur="5.48">things are really starting to go wrong</text>
  <text start="70.229" dur="7.681">for these central bankers the elite and</text>
  <text start="73.25" dur="9.88">we can see right now the people well</text>
  <text start="77.91" dur="7.349">they are telling these individuals we</text>
  <text start="83.13" dur="5.099">don&amp;#39;t agree with you we don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="85.259" dur="5.791">what&amp;#39;s going on we don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="88.229" dur="6.151">anymore but we do have to remember one</text>
  <text start="91.05" dur="5.25">important thing is that even though we</text>
  <text start="94.38" dur="5.69">had the brexit that hasn&amp;#39;t actually</text>
  <text start="96.3" dur="8.79">happened yet they haven&amp;#39;t even started</text>
  <text start="100.07" dur="8.98">with article 50 yes we did have the</text>
  <text start="105.09" dur="7.02">Italian referendum Renzi most likely is</text>
  <text start="109.05" dur="3.84">out at least this is what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="112.11" dur="4.74">right now</text>
  <text start="112.89" dur="7.38">maybe but we know that the central</text>
  <text start="116.85" dur="3.92">bankers the elite they just don&amp;#39;t give</text>
  <text start="120.27" dur="4.68">up</text>
  <text start="120.77" dur="6.459">they don&amp;#39;t say dang it we were beaten</text>
  <text start="124.95" dur="6.36">let&amp;#39;s pack our bags let&amp;#39;s leave we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="127.229" dur="9.031">done here they don&amp;#39;t do that they keep</text>
  <text start="131.31" dur="7.11">pushing until they get their way and we</text>
  <text start="136.26" dur="5.46">can see right now they are trying to</text>
  <text start="138.42" dur="7.98">convince the world that what they have</text>
  <text start="141.72" dur="7.019">done for the world is fantastic that</text>
  <text start="146.4" dur="6.179">it&amp;#39;s incredible even though they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="148.739" dur="5.791">losing these referendums they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="152.579" dur="5.341">they&amp;#39;re still trying to put the message</text>
  <text start="154.53" dur="6.84">out there that everything that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="157.92" dur="7.86">done all the debt that they pushed onto</text>
  <text start="161.37" dur="7.5">countries it&amp;#39;s a good thing well it</text>
  <text start="165.78" dur="4.429">really isn&amp;#39;t because it robs the people</text>
  <text start="168.87" dur="4.11">of their livelihood</text>
  <text start="170.209" dur="7.721">it makes the countries sell off their</text>
  <text start="172.98" dur="7.439">assets and central bankers they&amp;#39;re able</text>
  <text start="177.93" dur="3.88">to call the shots because they put</text>
  <text start="180.419" dur="3.881">pressure on the government&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="181.81" dur="6.24">bye-bye what they&amp;#39;re saying or they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="184.3" dur="6.09">call in their markers and the country</text>
  <text start="188.05" dur="5.22">would have to pay that back so the</text>
  <text start="190.39" dur="4.44">central bankers have them but we can see</text>
  <text start="193.27" dur="5.1">right now that they&amp;#39;re trying to keep</text>
  <text start="194.83" dur="6.84">this illusion completely alive we see</text>
  <text start="198.37" dur="6.33">that gold was slammed down traders used</text>
  <text start="201.67" dur="6.42">about 3.5 billion of notional gold</text>
  <text start="204.7" dur="5.97">through future markets to push the gold</text>
  <text start="208.09" dur="8.01">prices down and we saw the gold prices</text>
  <text start="210.67" dur="8.43">completely drop and at this point until</text>
  <text start="216.1" dur="6.06">Obama leaves office they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="219.1" dur="6.63">pushing as hard as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="222.16" dur="6.92">that this economy is so incredible that</text>
  <text start="225.73" dur="5.43">you&amp;#39;ve never seen anything like it and</text>
  <text start="229.08" dur="4.9">you could see already from the job</text>
  <text start="231.16" dur="4.17">numbers from the GDP from every piece of</text>
  <text start="233.98" dur="3.72">information coming out of the US</text>
  <text start="235.33" dur="7.98">government it&amp;#39;s all incredible actually</text>
  <text start="237.7" dur="7.259">it&amp;#39;s the best we&amp;#39;ve ever seen and we</text>
  <text start="243.31" dur="4.649">know that the unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="244.959" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;re completely fake it&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="247.959" dur="4.59">gigantic illusion and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="251.109" dur="3.991">interesting about all of this is that</text>
  <text start="252.549" dur="7.201">retail employers reported the highest</text>
  <text start="255.1" dur="7.11">job cuts of any sector in November but</text>
  <text start="259.75" dur="6.66">they were all completely offset by the</text>
  <text start="262.21" dur="6.18">surge in holiday hiring now remember the</text>
  <text start="266.41" dur="5.93">layoffs the job cuts well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="268.39" dur="7.14">forever the hiring during the holiday</text>
  <text start="272.34" dur="6.25">that&amp;#39;s temporary and they&amp;#39;re using this</text>
  <text start="275.53" dur="6.38">to completely offset the numbers I mean</text>
  <text start="278.59" dur="6.03">in November 5,000 retail employees</text>
  <text start="281.91" dur="7.24">they&amp;#39;re targeted for layoffs during this</text>
  <text start="284.62" dur="8.31">month most of them from different stores</text>
  <text start="289.15" dur="8.25">that have gone bankrupt and other stores</text>
  <text start="292.93" dur="6.48">that are just closing stores but during</text>
  <text start="297.4" dur="4.05">the holiday season they have the ability</text>
  <text start="299.41" dur="3.75">to say well we have all these part-time</text>
  <text start="301.45" dur="3.99">jobs we&amp;#39;ll just say they&amp;#39;re full-time</text>
  <text start="303.16" dur="4.2">jobs add them on we don&amp;#39;t care that</text>
  <text start="305.44" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re temporary and we&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="307.36" dur="4.71">manipulate the entire thing and what</text>
  <text start="309.58" dur="5.699">happens is when January or February</text>
  <text start="312.07" dur="6.539">comes along they&amp;#39;re not going to carry</text>
  <text start="315.279" dur="6.84">because once again Obama would no longer</text>
  <text start="318.609" dur="5.49">be in the White House and they can turn</text>
  <text start="322.119" dur="5.49">around and blame it on some other</text>
  <text start="324.099" dur="5.55">individual maybe like Trump but we can</text>
  <text start="327.609" dur="6.32">see from the Fed labor market condition</text>
  <text start="329.649" dur="8.54">index this has been deteriorating</text>
  <text start="333.929" dur="6.94">year-over-year for five straight months</text>
  <text start="338.189" dur="4.78">now the index itself is at an</text>
  <text start="340.869" dur="4.2">eight-month high this is still the fifth</text>
  <text start="342.969" dur="5.84">straight month of contraction year of</text>
  <text start="345.069" dur="8.13">year-over-year and when we look at this</text>
  <text start="348.809" dur="9.49">we see every single time pretty much</text>
  <text start="353.199" dur="8.37">that the Fed labor index contracts we</text>
  <text start="358.299" dur="8.84">end up in a recession it happened in</text>
  <text start="361.569" dur="9.62">1977 it happened in 1982 it happened in</text>
  <text start="367.139" dur="10.87">2002 it happened in 2007 and here we are</text>
  <text start="371.189" dur="9.22">once again and most likely from what</text>
  <text start="378.009" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;re seeing that we&amp;#39;re gonna be heading</text>
  <text start="380.409" dur="5.37">down into the same area that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="382.599" dur="5.011">heading into a depression because right</text>
  <text start="385.779" dur="3.72">now from everything that I&amp;#39;m looking at</text>
  <text start="387.61" dur="6.359">from all the economic indicators we are</text>
  <text start="389.499" dur="8.46">already in a recession now there was a</text>
  <text start="393.969" dur="9.11">report that was done and they did an</text>
  <text start="397.959" dur="8.88">analysis of what happens when government</text>
  <text start="403.079" dur="7.33">requires licensing regulations does it</text>
  <text start="406.839" dur="5.37">really kill jobs and this analysis is</text>
  <text start="410.409" dur="5.58">from the Wisconsin Institute for law and</text>
  <text start="412.209" dur="6.3">liberty it&amp;#39;s called will and when they</text>
  <text start="415.989" dur="3.17">looked at this they found that yes it</text>
  <text start="418.509" dur="6.11">does</text>
  <text start="419.159" dur="8.44">because over the last 20 years of</text>
  <text start="424.619" dur="6.82">expansion of licensing requirements</text>
  <text start="427.599" dur="6.57">it caused 31,000 fewer jobs to be had</text>
  <text start="431.439" dur="8.25">and cost consumers almost two billion</text>
  <text start="434.169" dur="8.46">dollars and what they found was they</text>
  <text start="439.689" dur="7.29">were licensing and adding regulations</text>
  <text start="442.629" dur="5.501">adding costs for ridiculous things in 17</text>
  <text start="446.979" dur="3.191">states</text>
  <text start="448.13" dur="4.23">African hair braiding requires requires</text>
  <text start="450.17" dur="5.93">a cosmetology license which cost about</text>
  <text start="452.36" dur="6.21">five thousand to fifteen thousand</text>
  <text start="456.1" dur="5.23">dollars and thousands of hours of</text>
  <text start="458.57" dur="5.7">classroom training in Wisconsin</text>
  <text start="461.33" dur="6.6">government also requires licensing for</text>
  <text start="464.27" dur="6.8">auctioneering beekeeping selling</text>
  <text start="467.93" dur="7.59">Christmas trees dance therapy and</text>
  <text start="471.07" dur="10.3">selling ice cream and they said because</text>
  <text start="475.52" dur="11.07">of all this jobs were lost and we see</text>
  <text start="481.37" dur="8.73">right now that more and more regulation</text>
  <text start="486.59" dur="6.72">more licensing it&amp;#39;s not about keeping</text>
  <text start="490.1" dur="4.92">everyone controlled and making sure they</text>
  <text start="493.31" dur="4.5">know what they&amp;#39;re doing it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="495.02" dur="5.61">taking funds from the people I mean</text>
  <text start="497.81" dur="4.71">really selling ice cream you really need</text>
  <text start="500.63" dur="3.33">a license for that actually any of these</text>
  <text start="502.52" dur="5.04">things do you really need a license for</text>
  <text start="503.96" dur="4.77">it doesn&amp;#39;t doesn&amp;#39;t mean anything I mean</text>
  <text start="507.56" dur="2.91">if somebody was gonna commit a crime or</text>
  <text start="508.73" dur="3.84">do something it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="510.47" dur="4.65">licensed or not I mean we have laws</text>
  <text start="512.57" dur="6.33">already to say oh you shouldn&amp;#39;t steal</text>
  <text start="515.12" dur="6.84">but people do you shouldn&amp;#39;t kill but</text>
  <text start="518.9" dur="5.43">people do so having a license doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="521.96" dur="6">really stop someone from doing something</text>
  <text start="524.33" dur="7.11">I mean look at Wall Street I mean they</text>
  <text start="527.96" dur="6.33">pay a lot of money to have you know</text>
  <text start="531.44" dur="5.43">their Series seven and everything else</text>
  <text start="534.29" dur="6.51">and do they still steal do they still</text>
  <text start="536.87" dur="8.37">still do things illegally they do this</text>
  <text start="540.8" dur="6.36">is about controlling the people taking</text>
  <text start="545.24" dur="5.55">the funds from the people it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="547.16" dur="4.59">helping the job market at all now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="550.79" dur="3.63">been looking at many different</text>
  <text start="551.75" dur="6.12">indicators where we&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="554.42" dur="6.96">economy and we&amp;#39;re seeing that yes most</text>
  <text start="557.87" dur="4.94">likely right now we&amp;#39;re in a recession we</text>
  <text start="561.38" dur="5.46">know a lot of things are manipulated</text>
  <text start="562.81" dur="6.04">stock market being one of them and what</text>
  <text start="566.84" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;re noticing is that something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="568.85" dur="7.05">happening in the market we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="572.24" dur="8.13">major indices diverging notably new</text>
  <text start="575.9" dur="6.07">highs new lows soaring and when we look</text>
  <text start="580.37" dur="5.23">at this</text>
  <text start="581.97" dur="6.099">we&amp;#39;re seeing that this is showing up and</text>
  <text start="585.6" dur="8.739">it&amp;#39;s pointing to something called the</text>
  <text start="588.069" dur="8.491">Hindenburg omen signal and when we look</text>
  <text start="594.339" dur="5.73">at this and this is coming from renowned</text>
  <text start="596.56" dur="6.42">technician Tom McClelland and he is</text>
  <text start="600.069" dur="4.31">declaring that a Hindenburg omen has</text>
  <text start="602.98" dur="5.31">struck</text>
  <text start="604.379" dur="5.44">now the Hindenburg omen it&amp;#39;s a technical</text>
  <text start="608.29" dur="4.68">analysis that attempts to predict a</text>
  <text start="609.819" dur="4.89">forthcoming stock market crash now the</text>
  <text start="612.97" dur="4.229">Hindenburg omen of course is not a</text>
  <text start="614.709" dur="4.831">guarantee of a crash and the five</text>
  <text start="617.199" dur="5.07">criteria that must be met for a</text>
  <text start="619.54" dur="5.46">Hindenburg trigger typically needs to</text>
  <text start="622.269" dur="4.351">reoccur within 36 days for recon</text>
  <text start="625" dur="4.92">formation and looking at these</text>
  <text start="626.62" dur="5.459">statistics well they&amp;#39;re startling if we</text>
  <text start="629.92" dur="4.409">look back at historical data the</text>
  <text start="632.079" dur="4.38">probability of a move greater than 5% to</text>
  <text start="634.329" dur="5.521">the downside after a confirmed</text>
  <text start="636.459" dur="6.3">Hindenburg omen was 77% and usually take</text>
  <text start="639.85" dur="6.33">takes place within the next 40 days now</text>
  <text start="642.759" dur="6.18">there&amp;#39;s five criteria of the omen the</text>
  <text start="646.18" dur="4.8">first one the daily number of the New</text>
  <text start="648.939" dur="4.5">York Stock Exchange new 52-week highs</text>
  <text start="650.98" dur="5.969">and the daily number of the new 52 week</text>
  <text start="653.439" dur="5.64">lows must be both greater than 2.2</text>
  <text start="656.949" dur="6.63">percent of the total New York Stock</text>
  <text start="659.079" dur="8.94">Exchange issued traded that day now has</text>
  <text start="663.579" dur="6.24">that happened yes the second one the</text>
  <text start="668.019" dur="6.091">smaller of these numbers is greater than</text>
  <text start="669.819" dur="6.811">or equal to 69 this is not a rule but</text>
  <text start="674.11" dur="4.77">more like a checksum this condition is a</text>
  <text start="676.63" dur="6.78">function of the 2.2 percent of the total</text>

  <text start="683.41" dur="7.619">greater than 69 the New York Stock</text>
  <text start="689.079" dur="8.041">Exchange 10 week moving average is</text>
  <text start="691.029" dur="7.74">rising that&amp;#39;s number three yes it is ten</text>

  <text start="710.949" dur="5.241">the McClellan oscillator is negative</text>
  <text start="713.62" dur="6.21">five point eight five below zero</text>
  <text start="716.19" dur="7.54">the new 52 week highs cannot be more</text>
  <text start="719.83" dur="6.18">than twice the new 52 we closed the</text>
  <text start="723.73" dur="5.82">condition is absolutely mandatory now</text>
  <text start="726.01" dur="6.63">right now that one has not been met so</text>
  <text start="729.55" dur="7.289">it - no 236 new highs is more than</text>
  <text start="732.64" dur="6.75">double the 74 new lows and so from the</text>
  <text start="736.839" dur="5.221">most strict definition the hindenburg</text>
  <text start="739.39" dur="8.49">omen did not strike this week but we are</text>
  <text start="742.06" dur="9.36">getting very very close and what we see</text>
  <text start="747.88" dur="5.49">right now is we&amp;#39;re getting closer and</text>
  <text start="751.42" dur="5.789">closer to this because there&amp;#39;s only one</text>
  <text start="753.37" dur="5.67">criteria that has to be met and we do</text>
  <text start="757.209" dur="4.891">have to keep something in mind is that</text>
  <text start="759.04" dur="6.9">this stock market has been manipulated</text>
  <text start="762.1" dur="5.91">like we&amp;#39;ve never seen before remember we</text>
  <text start="765.94" dur="5.25">have high frequency trading plunge</text>

  <text start="793.42" dur="6.87">down now in Italy we see that the people</text>
  <text start="797.88" dur="6.01">decided you know something we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="800.29" dur="5.6">enough we had enough of globalists we</text>
  <text start="803.89" dur="8.25">had enough of the central bankers and</text>
  <text start="805.89" dur="8.98">they voted no and Renzi right now well</text>
  <text start="812.14" dur="4.889">he&amp;#39;s saying that he is resigning well</text>
  <text start="814.87" dur="5.459">maybe we&amp;#39;ll get into that in just a</text>
  <text start="817.029" dur="6.601">minute and we can see right now many</text>
  <text start="820.329" dur="6.031">things are about to happen we see the</text>
  <text start="823.63" dur="4.649">five star movement this is Italy&amp;#39;s new</text>
  <text start="826.36" dur="5.34">populist party which is anti-globalist</text>
  <text start="828.279" dur="7.411">and - your own well they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="831.7" dur="6.36">looking to become the next party in</text>
  <text start="835.69" dur="4.35">charge of Italy and then they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="838.06" dur="6.899">to be calling for a referendum to leave</text>
  <text start="840.04" dur="6.45">the euro the EU we see that the UK has</text>
  <text start="844.959" dur="2.691">already done this but we have to keep</text>
  <text start="846.49" dur="4.16">something</text>
  <text start="847.65" dur="6.06">in the back of our minds even though the</text>
  <text start="850.65" dur="6.6">UK has voted to leave the EU it has not</text>
  <text start="853.71" dur="6.42">happened yet they have not invoked</text>
  <text start="857.25" dur="6.12">article 50 as of yet it hasn&amp;#39;t happened</text>
  <text start="860.13" dur="7.29">we know that we just had this referendum</text>
  <text start="863.37" dur="6.54">in Italy where they voted no and at this</text>
  <text start="867.42" dur="5.43">point nothing has still happened</text>
  <text start="869.91" dur="5.4">remember the central bankers they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="872.85" dur="5.07">just gonna walk away and say hey you</text>
  <text start="875.31" dur="4.92">know what we give they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="877.92" dur="4.83">whatever they possibly can to stay in</text>
  <text start="880.23" dur="4.89">charge they&amp;#39;ve been working on this for</text>
  <text start="882.75" dur="4.8">a very long time now the people well</text>
  <text start="885.12" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re pushing back and of course</text>
  <text start="887.55" dur="3.68">central bankers the elites they do not</text>
  <text start="889.95" dur="4.38">like this whatsoever</text>
  <text start="891.23" dur="8.2">now Renzi said he was going to resign</text>
  <text start="894.33" dur="7.44">and now well he&amp;#39;s saying he&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="899.43" dur="5.61">to resign just yet he&amp;#39;ll hold the post</text>
  <text start="901.77" dur="6.09">until the Senate budget law is passed</text>
  <text start="905.04" dur="5.91">which could take place maybe late or</text>
  <text start="907.86" dur="6.48">next week or maybe I&amp;#39;ll take a little</text>
  <text start="910.95" dur="6.32">bit longer so this is still up in the</text>
  <text start="914.34" dur="6.06">air now German Finance Minister Wolfgang</text>
  <text start="917.27" dur="6.13">Shai blaa while he&amp;#39;s out there telling</text>
  <text start="920.4" dur="5.12">Greece to carry out unpopular reforms if</text>
  <text start="923.4" dur="4.68">they want to stay in the euro zone and</text>
  <text start="925.52" dur="5.35">he&amp;#39;s saying that we are not giving any</text>
  <text start="928.08" dur="5.94">type of debt relief to Athens he also</text>
  <text start="930.87" dur="6.81">said that Italy should continue the</text>
  <text start="934.02" dur="5.04">economic reforms begun by Renzi now they</text>
  <text start="937.68" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t want anything change they want</text>
  <text start="939.06" dur="5.7">everything the way it was happening they</text>
  <text start="942.12" dur="4.53">want to stay in control and we can see</text>
  <text start="944.76" dur="3.9">right now that this is spreading people</text>
  <text start="946.65" dur="5.37">are looking at this and saying okay the</text>
  <text start="948.66" dur="6.35">UK did it Italy wants to do it we know</text>
  <text start="952.02" dur="5.67">most likely NEX it&amp;#39;s going to be France</text>
  <text start="955.01" dur="5.71">maybe the next thing is going to be</text>
  <text start="957.69" dur="5.58">another country and so on and so on and</text>
  <text start="960.72" dur="4.5">we can see this is a domino effect and</text>
  <text start="963.27" dur="4.11">the central bankers are going to do</text>
  <text start="965.22" dur="5.07">whatever they possibly can to stop this</text>
  <text start="967.38" dur="6.81">they don&amp;#39;t want this to occur right now</text>
  <text start="970.29" dur="5.22">and how do they stop this well they can</text>
  <text start="974.19" dur="4.53">do many things they can have an event</text>
  <text start="975.51" dur="3.74">they can bring us to war they can</text>
  <text start="978.72" dur="3.26">distract</text>
  <text start="979.25" dur="4.889">the people but as more and more</text>
  <text start="981.98" dur="3.539">countries see this and more and more</text>
  <text start="984.139" dur="3.031">people look at this and they say you</text>
  <text start="985.519" dur="5.49">know something we don&amp;#39;t want to be part</text>
  <text start="987.17" dur="6.539">of this system that means we&amp;#39;re that</text>
  <text start="991.009" dur="6.841">much closer from the elite the central</text>
  <text start="993.709" dur="5.61">bankers doing something we already see</text>
  <text start="997.85" dur="5.669">that they&amp;#39;re trying to eliminate cash</text>
  <text start="999.319" dur="5.611">they want a cashless society and we see</text>
  <text start="1003.519" dur="4.62">something very interesting happening</text>
  <text start="1004.93" dur="5.759">here the European payment council the</text>
  <text start="1008.139" dur="4.62">EPC a subdivision of the European</text>
  <text start="1010.689" dur="5.21">Central Bank well they&amp;#39;ve just taken a</text>
  <text start="1012.759" dur="6.93">giant step forward in their quest to</text>
  <text start="1015.899" dur="6.281">completely eliminate all cash to</text>
  <text start="1019.689" dur="3.75">increase taxes because this way they</text>
  <text start="1022.18" dur="2.94">know where you&amp;#39;re purchasing they know</text>
  <text start="1023.439" dur="4.441">where your funds are they can keep track</text>
  <text start="1025.12" dur="5.25">of everything so what did they do well</text>
  <text start="1027.88" dur="4.829">you know today that everything is not</text>
  <text start="1030.37" dur="4.98">instantaneous money has to be</text>
  <text start="1032.709" dur="5.22">transferred things take maybe one or two</text>
  <text start="1035.35" dur="5.339">days even electronically and that&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="1037.929" dur="4.77">of the stumbling blocks is that you</text>
  <text start="1040.689" dur="6.421">can&amp;#39;t transfer money the same day for</text>
  <text start="1042.699" dur="5.791">banks you know back and forth they like</text>
  <text start="1047.11" dur="3.33">to play with your money so they put it</text>
  <text start="1048.49" dur="3.96">in limbo and let&amp;#39;s say oh it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="1050.44" dur="3.81">take two days they take your money you</text>
  <text start="1052.45" dur="4.08">don&amp;#39;t have it but they do and they can</text>
  <text start="1054.25" dur="4.74">play with it well it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1056.53" dur="4.86">getting rid of that because for a</text>
  <text start="1058.99" dur="6.299">completely cashless society everything</text>
  <text start="1061.39" dur="9.409">has to be instantaneous so what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1065.289" dur="8.701">doing is they are creating this system</text>
  <text start="1070.799" dur="5.411">to be completely instantaneous and the</text>
  <text start="1073.99" dur="7.47">goal is to eliminate ATM machines get</text>
  <text start="1076.21" dur="7.969">rid of cash maybe by next year that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1081.46" dur="7.8">how quickly they are moving right now</text>
  <text start="1084.179" dur="9.281">and they want total control of the</text>
  <text start="1089.26" dur="7.08">system they want to know where all your</text>
  <text start="1093.46" dur="5.73">wealth is it&amp;#39;s much easier to tax it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1096.34" dur="5.01">much easier to control you if you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1099.19" dur="3.349">take it out in cash and hold it because</text>
  <text start="1101.35" dur="5.88">all they have to do is lock your account</text>
  <text start="1102.539" dur="8.5">you have no access and this is what</text>
  <text start="1107.23" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re trying to do we see countries</text>
  <text start="1111.039" dur="3.621">right now</text>
  <text start="1112.09" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re moving away from the dollar even</text>
  <text start="1114.66" dur="7.72">Turkey while they see the writing on the</text>
  <text start="1117.37" dur="6.9">wall and her Dhawan was out there and he</text>
  <text start="1122.38" dur="5.52">is offered to trade with Russia China</text>
  <text start="1124.27" dur="6.03">and Iran in their local currencies he</text>
  <text start="1127.9" dur="3.99">said if we buy something from them we</text>
  <text start="1130.3" dur="3.6">will use their money if they buy</text>
  <text start="1131.89" dur="7.08">something from us that will use our</text>
  <text start="1133.9" dur="7.83">currency and he called on all Turks to</text>
  <text start="1138.97" dur="4.86">stop hoarding foreign currencies and to</text>
  <text start="1141.73" dur="5.76">exchange dollars and euro into Turkish</text>
  <text start="1143.83" dur="6.03">lira and gold why would he be doing this</text>
  <text start="1147.49" dur="6.78">at this point well he sees the writing</text>
  <text start="1149.86" dur="9.09">on the wall he understands the dollar is</text>
  <text start="1154.27" dur="9.99">doomed all is lost in Syria there push</text>
  <text start="1158.95" dur="7.29">to go from Syria into Iran and to</text>
  <text start="1164.26" dur="4.77">control the Middle East on the petro</text>
  <text start="1166.24" dur="6.26">dollar that is falling apart right now</text>
  <text start="1169.03" dur="5.94">and we can see many countries right now</text>
  <text start="1172.5" dur="5.08">they&amp;#39;re not using the dollar anymore</text>
  <text start="1174.97" dur="5.61">because they understand what is</text>
  <text start="1177.58" dur="5.28">happening that the dollar is at its end</text>
  <text start="1180.58" dur="4.28">game they understand the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="1182.86" dur="5.16">will no longer exist they understand</text>
  <text start="1184.86" dur="5.5">that the system is going to crash better</text>
  <text start="1188.02" dur="5.43">get gold better get out of the dollar</text>
  <text start="1190.36" dur="5.43">and we see many countries are doing this</text>
  <text start="1193.45" dur="5.01">and everyone should do the same they</text>
  <text start="1195.79" dur="5.52">should ramp up on gold and silver get</text>
  <text start="1198.46" dur="4.35">their supplies they need keep cash on</text>
  <text start="1201.31" dur="3.78">hand because you will need it in the</text>
  <text start="1202.81" dur="3.87">beginning stages because people won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1205.09" dur="3.39">understand gold and silver they&amp;#39;ll still</text>
  <text start="1206.68" dur="3.81">understand cash even though we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="1208.48" dur="4.49">inflation you will still need to use</text>
  <text start="1210.49" dur="6.24">this but you keep the gold and silver</text>
  <text start="1212.97" dur="6.94">safe because this is your wealth you</text>

  <text start="1231.85" dur="3.78">probably worth absolutely nothing you</text>
  <text start="1233.71" dur="6.18">probably have pennies on the dollar when</text>
  <text start="1235.63" dur="6.45">we do the conversion so we need to be</text>
