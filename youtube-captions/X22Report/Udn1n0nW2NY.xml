  <text start="118.3" dur="7.349">game is to get everything prepared and</text>
  <text start="122.35" dur="5.82">ready to bring it all down around the</text>
  <text start="125.649" dur="4.981">central bank and the deep state you</text>
  <text start="128.17" dur="5.91">don&amp;#39;t want to throw out all your cards</text>
  <text start="130.63" dur="6.78">at the beginning of the game think about</text>
  <text start="134.08" dur="6.239">poker for an example if you have a royal</text>
  <text start="137.41" dur="4.62">flush you&amp;#39;re not gonna throw it down and</text>
  <text start="140.319" dur="4.53">say up Royal Flush</text>
  <text start="142.03" dur="6.99">I win know what you wait to do is you</text>
  <text start="144.849" dur="8.551">wait until the pot gets really big you</text>
  <text start="149.02" dur="9.03">pretend you have nothing you pretend or</text>
  <text start="153.4" dur="7.32">Bluff you don&amp;#39;t have a good hand and you</text>
  <text start="158.05" dur="5.999">let all the others think that you have</text>
  <text start="160.72" dur="4.5">nothing while they think they have</text>
  <text start="164.049" dur="3.241">everything</text>
  <text start="165.22" dur="4.59">and they throw everything into the pot</text>
  <text start="167.29" dur="7.32">everything that they have and you play</text>
  <text start="169.81" dur="9.47">that hand at the very end once the pot</text>
  <text start="174.61" dur="8.58">is full and they have nothing left that</text>
  <text start="179.28" dur="7">is what is happening right now with the</text>
  <text start="183.19" dur="4.56">plan this is what Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="186.28" dur="3.6">are doing right now</text>
  <text start="187.75" dur="4.59">not just with those people that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="189.88" dur="5.28">going to arrest but those people that</text>
  <text start="192.34" dur="6.54">are working in the central bank those</text>
  <text start="195.16" dur="7.68">individuals that want a central bank</text>
  <text start="198.88" dur="8.39">those individuals that are pushing the</text>
  <text start="202.84" dur="7.5">next system and Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="207.27" dur="6.01">they have the Royal Flush but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="210.34" dur="5.97">pretending they have nothing they do</text>
  <text start="213.28" dur="5.48">give out hints along the way letting you</text>
  <text start="216.31" dur="5.64">know that they have an incredible hand</text>
  <text start="218.76" dur="5.74">but for the most part they&amp;#39;re bluffing</text>
  <text start="221.95" dur="5.19">and telling everyone they have</text>
  <text start="224.5" dur="3.72">absolutely nothing now on the other hand</text>
  <text start="227.14" dur="3.9">if you look at the deep state in the</text>
  <text start="228.22" dur="6.269">central bank&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re bluffing to the</text>
  <text start="231.04" dur="6.69">American people like they have it all so</text>
  <text start="234.489" dur="5.491">you see what&amp;#39;s happening here we have a</text>
  <text start="237.73" dur="4.65">side which is the deep state and central</text>
  <text start="239.98" dur="6.18">bank which they believe they have the</text>
  <text start="242.38" dur="5.97">most powerful hand when really they have</text>
  <text start="246.16" dur="4.65">the weakest hand and we have Trump of</text>
  <text start="248.35" dur="4.62">the Patriots that have a very powerful</text>
  <text start="250.81" dur="6">hand and they&amp;#39;re pretending they have a</text>
  <text start="252.97" dur="6.36">very weak hand that&amp;#39;s what we see</text>
  <text start="256.81" dur="5.37">happening right now and Trump of the</text>
  <text start="259.33" dur="6.72">Patriots want the deep state essential</text>
  <text start="262.18" dur="8.16">banks to use everything they have and</text>
  <text start="266.05" dur="6.66">throw it into the pot and this is what</text>
  <text start="270.34" dur="6.45">is happening right now Trump has given</text>
  <text start="272.71" dur="6.93">us hints along the way and he&amp;#39;s told us</text>
  <text start="276.79" dur="5.31">what the plan is and we&amp;#39;ll be getting</text>
  <text start="279.64" dur="7.4">into that in just a minute but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="282.1" dur="9.09">head out to the UK now the UK has now</text>
  <text start="287.04" dur="8.379">received a 48-hour ultimatum from who</text>
  <text start="291.19" dur="6.36">the EU and they have to come up and talk</text>
  <text start="295.419" dur="3.481">about the UK with an accept an</text>
  <text start="297.55" dur="3.21">acceptable change to</text>
  <text start="298.9" dur="4.92">Irish backs up but the problem is and</text>
  <text start="300.76" dur="6.21">Brussels knows this the EU knows this</text>
  <text start="303.82" dur="5.73">there is no acceptable change to the</text>
  <text start="306.97" dur="5.88">Irish backstop so what&amp;#39;s the play here</text>
  <text start="309.55" dur="6.83">what is the EU trying to do well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="312.85" dur="6.03">trying to get the British people to fold</text>
  <text start="316.38" dur="5.05">they want them to say okay you know what</text>
  <text start="318.88" dur="5.97">they gave us an ultimatum we can&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="321.43" dur="7.86">let&amp;#39;s just go with Mays deal period but</text>
  <text start="324.85" dur="7.65">guess what it&amp;#39;s not going to work every</text>
  <text start="329.29" dur="7.5">day that this goes on the people are</text>
  <text start="332.5" dur="7.95">more aware of what is going on and the</text>
  <text start="336.79" dur="6.93">worse the EU gets I mean look at all the</text>
  <text start="340.45" dur="7.29">data that&amp;#39;s coming out the EU is not</text>
  <text start="343.72" dur="7.35">doing well and the fear-mongering is not</text>
  <text start="347.74" dur="6.36">working people see right through it they</text>
  <text start="351.07" dur="7.74">can see what the EU is trying to do and</text>
  <text start="354.1" dur="8.72">the people well they&amp;#39;re awake they were</text>
  <text start="358.81" dur="7.29">awake when they voted for the brexit and</text>
  <text start="362.82" dur="5.44">once the people say you know something</text>
  <text start="366.1" dur="6.72">we&amp;#39;re not going with anything that you</text>
  <text start="368.26" dur="6.15">want we&amp;#39;re gonna do it our way the EU is</text>
  <text start="372.82" dur="3.54">going to be in trouble now do you think</text>
  <text start="374.41" dur="6.72">the EU is going to try to do something</text>
  <text start="376.36" dur="7.5">before that if they realize that this is</text>
  <text start="381.13" dur="5.46">what the UK is going to do absolutely</text>
  <text start="383.86" dur="5.64">you can expect something pretty darn big</text>
  <text start="386.59" dur="5.79">and I&amp;#39;m wondering if those packages that</text>
  <text start="389.5" dur="6.54">were sent around to the London transit</text>
  <text start="392.38" dur="5.61">hub and all that was the first step but</text>
  <text start="396.04" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see we see here</text>
  <text start="397.99" dur="5.7">out in the u.s. we have the unemployment</text>
  <text start="401.44" dur="5.67">numbers that have come in and it looks</text>
  <text start="403.69" dur="6.57">like the US has added a lot less jobs</text>
  <text start="407.11" dur="5.07">than was expected in February and this</text>
  <text start="410.26" dur="4.26">is kind of normal at the beginning of</text>
  <text start="412.18" dur="3.72">the year jobs decline I have to remember</text>
  <text start="414.52" dur="3.6">all these numbers are completely</text>
  <text start="415.9" dur="3.72">manipulated and the number of people</text>
  <text start="418.12" dur="3.99">that are not in the labor force right</text>
  <text start="419.62" dur="5.57">now has increased from 95 point 0 1</text>
  <text start="422.11" dur="6">million to 95 point 2 1 million and</text>
  <text start="425.19" dur="6.13">remember the labor force petition rate</text>
  <text start="428.11" dur="4.49">right now is very very low we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="431.32" dur="3.65">all the way back to the</text>
  <text start="432.6" dur="4.38">70s that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re at right now and</text>
  <text start="434.97" dur="4.8">the labor force participation rate has</text>
  <text start="436.98" dur="5.91">never gone back up to where it was where</text>
  <text start="439.77" dur="4.68">we saw the height back in the 2000s and</text>
  <text start="442.89" dur="4.59">then it dropped a little bit going into</text>
  <text start="444.45" dur="4.98">2008 and now we&amp;#39;re all the way back to</text>
  <text start="447.48" dur="5.16">the 70s location and really when you</text>
  <text start="449.43" dur="5.64">think about this you can see when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="452.64" dur="4.83">looking at the graph starting at the 70s</text>
  <text start="455.07" dur="6.24">guess what this is when the baby boom</text>
  <text start="457.47" dur="6.99">was moving into jobs when they were</text>
  <text start="461.31" dur="6.21">buying homes this is when the Fiat</text>
  <text start="464.46" dur="4.29">system that the central banks were where</text>
  <text start="467.52" dur="3.15">they took us off the gold send this is</text>
  <text start="468.75" dur="4.05">when it all came into play and you can</text>
  <text start="470.67" dur="4.62">see the participation rate well it</text>
  <text start="472.8" dur="7.29">climbed during this period and then it</text>
  <text start="475.29" dur="7.02">started to decline after the year 2000</text>
  <text start="480.09" dur="4.02">and now we&amp;#39;re at the lowest point and</text>
  <text start="482.31" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re back to the beginning so think</text>
  <text start="484.11" dur="6.96">about what happened 45 to 50 years later</text>
  <text start="486.75" dur="6.27">we know that the Fiat system has reached</text>
  <text start="491.07" dur="4.26">a point where it&amp;#39;s going to implode on</text>
  <text start="493.02" dur="4.77">itself we also have the same exact</text>
  <text start="495.33" dur="4.56">people back in the 70s they&amp;#39;re much much</text>
  <text start="497.79" dur="4.05">older and they&amp;#39;re getting out of the</text>
  <text start="499.89" dur="4.79">workforce now we have two things</text>
  <text start="501.84" dur="6.42">happening all at the same time we have</text>
  <text start="504.68" dur="5.89">the Fiat system which is imploding on</text>
  <text start="508.26" dur="4.35">itself and we have people retiring and</text>
  <text start="510.57" dur="3.69">since the Fiat system is imploding on</text>
  <text start="512.61" dur="5.84">itself the people that are coming into</text>
  <text start="514.26" dur="7.56">the labor market they can&amp;#39;t find jobs so</text>
  <text start="518.45" dur="5.38">and for those people who can&amp;#39;t find jobs</text>
  <text start="521.82" dur="2.79">who haven&amp;#39;t been on an interview in the</text>
  <text start="523.83" dur="3.12">last four weeks</text>
  <text start="524.61" dur="4.53">you&amp;#39;re accounted as not looking for a</text>
  <text start="526.95" dur="7.2">job anymore so we have all these things</text>
  <text start="529.14" dur="7.83">happening at the same time we also see</text>
  <text start="534.15" dur="5.25">that household net worth it is tumbled</text>
  <text start="536.97" dur="5.04">by 3.7 trillion that&amp;#39;s the first drop in</text>
  <text start="539.4" dur="5.25">four years now this is to be expected</text>
  <text start="542.01" dur="5.94">because remember the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="544.65" dur="6.78">System was created to only allow the</text>
  <text start="547.95" dur="5.94">wealth to be captured by the top 10% and</text>
  <text start="551.43" dur="6.08">if you actually look you can see that</text>
  <text start="553.89" dur="5.91">the top 10% of the US population has</text>
  <text start="557.51" dur="5.89">most of the wealth about a hundred</text>
  <text start="559.8" dur="6.15">trillion belongs to the top 10% the rest</text>
  <text start="563.4" dur="4.98">is the middle on the bottom</text>
  <text start="565.95" dur="4.14">and this is how the federal reserve</text>
  <text start="568.38" dur="5.25">system works is that the central banking</text>
  <text start="570.09" dur="6">system works and this does not help the</text>
  <text start="573.63" dur="4.14">economy yes it helps the elite it helps</text>
  <text start="576.09" dur="4.83">the very wealthy but the rest of the</text>
  <text start="577.77" dur="6.09">people they struggle through all of this</text>
  <text start="580.92" dur="4.2">now the mainstream media financial</text>
  <text start="583.86" dur="3.18">pundits they&amp;#39;re out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="585.12" dur="4.23">talking about the stock market how the</text>
  <text start="587.04" dur="4.23">stock market is declining oh my god</text>
  <text start="589.35" dur="4.08">this is terrible the whole thing&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="591.27" dur="4.11">falling apart and Trump was out there</text>
  <text start="593.43" dur="5.1">saying listen once the China trade deal</text>
  <text start="595.38" dur="6.42">is made you&amp;#39;re gonna see the stock</text>
  <text start="598.53" dur="4.68">market skyrocket and Trump you have to</text>
  <text start="601.8" dur="3.27">remember he has the magic one he has</text>
  <text start="603.21" dur="4.77">complete and utter control over the</text>
  <text start="605.07" dur="5.73">market and if he wants the market to go</text>
  <text start="607.98" dur="4.95">up all he has to do is push the button</text>
  <text start="610.8" dur="5.85">and the market goes up it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="612.93" dur="6.72">manipulated but we need to remember</text>
  <text start="616.65" dur="4.38">something very important Trump with</text>
  <text start="619.65" dur="3.45">everything that&amp;#39;s going on with the</text>
  <text start="621.03" dur="3.6">market and all this and how he&amp;#39;s looking</text>
  <text start="623.1" dur="3.3">at the market continually telling people</text>
  <text start="624.63" dur="2.85">look how great the market is look at our</text>
  <text start="626.4" dur="2.82">own play remember these are all</text>
  <text start="627.48" dur="3.63">statistical numbers that the deep state</text>
  <text start="629.22" dur="3.45">central banks have used in the past he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="631.11" dur="2.43">using this against them because what are</text>
  <text start="632.67" dur="2.76">they gonna do they&amp;#39;re gonna start</text>
  <text start="633.54" dur="4.11">turning on the numbers they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="635.43" dur="3.9">using for a very long time yes they</text>
  <text start="637.65" dur="4.98">might switch off and say look housings</text>
  <text start="639.33" dur="6.15">not doing well oh look this but everyone</text>
  <text start="642.63" dur="6.02">has been brainwashed to accept these</text>
  <text start="645.48" dur="6.42">numbers so he&amp;#39;s using them against them</text>
  <text start="648.65" dur="5.62">now we need to remember that cue has</text>
  <text start="651.9" dur="3.63">been telling us that gold is going to be</text>
  <text start="654.27" dur="3.57">bring down the Fed the Fed is going to</text>
  <text start="655.53" dur="5.81">be restructured and we need to go back</text>
  <text start="657.84" dur="6.18">to 2017 because Trump did give us</text>
  <text start="661.34" dur="6.34">different messages during that time</text>
  <text start="664.02" dur="6.33">period and he told us what to expect now</text>
  <text start="667.68" dur="6.45">this is out of Forbes which they were</text>
  <text start="670.35" dur="4.11">reporting on CPAC in 2017 President</text>
  <text start="674.13" dur="2.61">Trump</text>
  <text start="674.46" dur="4.38">replaced the dollar with gold as the</text>
  <text start="676.74" dur="5.64">global currency to make America great</text>
  <text start="678.84" dur="6.86">again and when he was talking in speech</text>
  <text start="682.38" dur="5.85">CPAC he said the following statement</text>
  <text start="685.7" dur="4.09">global cooperation dealing with other</text>
  <text start="688.23" dur="4.32">countries get along with other countries</text>
  <text start="689.79" dur="5.25">as good it&amp;#39;s very important but there is</text>
  <text start="692.55" dur="6.36">no such thing as a global anthem a</text>
  <text start="695.04" dur="4.77">global currency or a global flag this is</text>
  <text start="698.91" dur="5.1">the United States</text>
  <text start="699.81" dur="7.59">America that I am representing he also</text>
  <text start="704.01" dur="5.7">said we used to have a very solid</text>
  <text start="707.4" dur="6.21">country because it was based on a gold</text>
  <text start="709.71" dur="6.15">standard but he said it would be tough</text>
  <text start="713.61" dur="6.479">to bring it back because we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="715.86" dur="7.86">the gold other places have the gold now</text>
  <text start="720.089" dur="5.521">again do we have the gold well Q has</text>
  <text start="723.72" dur="5.369">told us that gold will bring down the</text>

  <text start="729.089" dur="6.931">actually have all the gold as of yet</text>
  <text start="732.71" dur="5.47">Trump continued bringing back the gold</text>
  <text start="736.02" dur="5.43">standard would be very hard to do but</text>
  <text start="738.18" dur="6.99">boy would it be wonderful we&amp;#39;d have a</text>
  <text start="741.45" dur="7.889">standard on which to base our money so</text>
  <text start="745.17" dur="6.51">Trump right there believes in the gold</text>
  <text start="749.339" dur="6.511">standard and he doesn&amp;#39;t believe in</text>
  <text start="751.68" dur="8.7">globalism and it&amp;#39;s and this fits into</text>
  <text start="755.85" dur="7.83">the message that Q gave us now Q never</text>
  <text start="760.38" dur="6.54">told us that we have all the gold and</text>
  <text start="763.68" dur="6.84">we&amp;#39;re gonna use it against the Fed all q</text>
  <text start="766.92" dur="5.91">told us was the gold is going to bring</text>
  <text start="770.52" dur="5.64">down the Fed and we discussed all</text>
  <text start="772.83" dur="5.52">different ways that gold can bring down</text>
  <text start="776.16" dur="8.03">the Federal Reserve because remember</text>
  <text start="778.35" dur="9.39">gold is accepted everywhere and everyone</text>
  <text start="784.19" dur="7.21">understands gold we know that gold has</text>
  <text start="787.74" dur="5.82">been manipulated and once the</text>
  <text start="791.4" dur="5.7">manipulation ends and gold is allowed to</text>
  <text start="793.56" dur="8.13">do what it does best rise against a</text>
  <text start="797.1" dur="8.79">failing paper currency gold will</text>
  <text start="801.69" dur="6.69">outshine the Fed now add on top of this</text>
  <text start="805.89" dur="5.22">which we discussed before Trump is</text>
  <text start="808.38" dur="4.65">looking to get the five g6g system here</text>
  <text start="811.11" dur="5.13">in the United States which supports the</text>
  <text start="813.03" dur="7.62">blockchain combine these two things</text>
  <text start="816.24" dur="8.82">together guess what you can have a gold</text>
  <text start="820.65" dur="8.37">back electronic currency and there is no</text>
  <text start="825.06" dur="6.33">need for the Fed so Trump has already</text>
  <text start="829.02" dur="4.2">given us hence Trump has already told us</text>
  <text start="831.39" dur="3.809">what to expect q</text>
  <text start="833.22" dur="4.76">has already told us what to expect and</text>
  <text start="835.199" dur="6.601">actually you can see how both messages</text>
  <text start="837.98" dur="6.339">work together so we&amp;#39;re headed in the</text>
  <text start="841.8" dur="5.93">right direction but again I go back to</text>
  <text start="844.319" dur="6.87">the beginning of this economic report</text>
