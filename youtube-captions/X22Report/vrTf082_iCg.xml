  <text start="258.1" dur="5.1">under its own weight this is why Trump</text>
  <text start="261.13" dur="8.22">the Patriots this is why they&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="263.2" dur="9.54">so quickly to reset everything resetting</text>
  <text start="269.35" dur="6.42">it for the transition Trump tweeted out</text>
  <text start="272.74" dur="4.98">the following the economy is strong and</text>
  <text start="275.77" dur="4.83">good whereas the rest of the world is</text>
  <text start="277.72" dur="4.83">not doing so well despite this fake news</text>
  <text start="280.6" dur="4.92">media together with their partner the</text>
  <text start="282.55" dur="5.19">Democratic Party are working overtime to</text>
  <text start="285.52" dur="4.98">convince people that we are in or will</text>
  <text start="287.74" dur="5.73">soon be going into a recession they are</text>
  <text start="290.5" dur="5.19">willing to lose their wealth or a big</text>

  <text start="295.69" dur="3.12">winning the election but it won&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="297.729" dur="4.801">because I</text>

  <text start="311.79" dur="5.65">what we&amp;#39;re watching right now</text>
  <text start="314.139" dur="5.571">is the show optics are very very</text>
  <text start="317.44" dur="6.53">important remember the Fed is</text>
  <text start="319.71" dur="7.87">independent it can&amp;#39;t look like Trump is</text>
  <text start="323.97" dur="7.81">controlling the Fed Trump is telling the</text>
  <text start="327.58" dur="7.16">Fed what to do this is why Trump is out</text>
  <text start="331.78" dur="5.19">there contradicting pushing the Fed</text>
  <text start="334.74" dur="4.66">saying listen if the Fed doesn&amp;#39;t do what</text>
  <text start="336.97" dur="5.73">I want no big deal I&amp;#39;ll do it without</text>
  <text start="339.4" dur="5.97">the Fed because he&amp;#39;s showing the world</text>
  <text start="342.7" dur="4.439">that he&amp;#39;s not really controlling the Fed</text>
  <text start="345.37" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re completely independent this way</text>
  <text start="347.139" dur="5.731">the mainstream media the deep state the</text>
  <text start="350.02" dur="5.49">dams and all the rest they can&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="352.87" dur="5.609">that he&amp;#39;s using political force to have</text>
  <text start="355.51" dur="7.37">the Fed do what he wants remember its</text>
  <text start="358.479" dur="6.69">optics it&amp;#39;s very very important now</text>
  <text start="362.88" dur="4.75">what&amp;#39;s very interesting this is coming</text>
  <text start="365.169" dur="4.921">out of the Financial Times the headline</text>
  <text start="367.63" dur="5.37">is the central banks have lost much of</text>
  <text start="370.09" dur="6.18">their clout and this is another push</text>
  <text start="373" dur="5.25">that Trump is continually pushing he</text>
  <text start="376.27" dur="5.18">wants everyone to understand that the</text>
  <text start="378.25" dur="8.31">Fed they don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="381.45" dur="9.55">they&amp;#39;re confused they&amp;#39;re conflicted now</text>
  <text start="386.56" dur="7.169">as we said yesterday the Fed other</text>
  <text start="391" dur="4.46">economists they&amp;#39;re exposing themselves</text>
  <text start="393.729" dur="5.881">this is all part of the plan</text>
  <text start="395.46" dur="8.56">Trump tweeted out now the Fed can show</text>
  <text start="399.61" dur="9.39">their stuff remember no matter what the</text>
  <text start="404.02" dur="8.13">Fed does Trump wins what do I mean by</text>
  <text start="409" dur="4.979">this well let&amp;#39;s say the Fed says you</text>
  <text start="412.15" dur="4.92">know what we&amp;#39;re not gonna listen to</text>
  <text start="413.979" dur="5.641">Trump I know he told us if we cut rates</text>
  <text start="417.07" dur="6.03">we start stimulus the economy would do</text>
  <text start="419.62" dur="5.669">fantastic and he also said listen if we</text>
  <text start="423.1" dur="5.189">don&amp;#39;t do this the economy will fail so</text>
  <text start="425.289" dur="4.741">if the Fed doesn&amp;#39;t cut rates doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="428.289" dur="3.481">start stimulus and the economy fails</text>
  <text start="430.03" dur="2.59">Trump points back to the Fed and says</text>
  <text start="431.77" dur="4.57">say</text>
  <text start="432.62" dur="6.42">told you so he wins if the Fed does</text>
  <text start="436.34" dur="7.139">exactly what Trump wants and the economy</text>
  <text start="439.04" dur="8.07">does very very well Trump wins again he</text>
  <text start="443.479" dur="7.531">is in a win-win situation the Fed they</text>
  <text start="447.11" dur="8.85">are not Trump tweeted out the following</text>
  <text start="451.01" dur="7.409">as usual the Fed did nothing it is</text>
  <text start="455.96" dur="6.3">incredible that they can speak without</text>
  <text start="458.419" dur="6.361">knowing or asking what I am doing which</text>
  <text start="462.26" dur="4.8">will be announced shortly with a very</text>
  <text start="464.78" dur="4.56">strong dollar in a very weak Fed I will</text>
  <text start="467.06" dur="5.37">work brilliantly with both and the US</text>
  <text start="469.34" dur="6.63">will do great my only question is who is</text>
  <text start="472.43" dur="7.59">our bigger enemy Jay Powell from the Fed</text>
  <text start="475.97" dur="8.009">or that or chairman ji think about what</text>
  <text start="480.02" dur="7.29">he just did here Trump is first of all</text>
  <text start="483.979" dur="6.231">saying that he has plans for the economy</text>
  <text start="487.31" dur="4.8">and the Fed who&amp;#39;s supposed to be</text>
  <text start="490.21" dur="3.88">controlling the economy because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="492.11" dur="5.52">why we need them they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="494.09" dur="6.509">communicating with Trump to understand</text>
  <text start="497.63" dur="8.55">what he&amp;#39;s doing so how are they making</text>
  <text start="500.599" dur="10.29">decisions right and the other thing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="506.18" dur="10.19">saying is who is our biggest enemy the</text>
  <text start="510.889" dur="8.82">Fed or China and we all know the answer</text>
  <text start="516.37" dur="7.29">he put there he put this out there on</text>
  <text start="519.709" dur="8.551">purpose he&amp;#39;s letting everyone know that</text>
  <text start="523.66" dur="6.91">the Fed is bad for this country the</text>
  <text start="528.26" dur="6.019">central bank the private western central</text>

  <text start="544.07" dur="4.86">rate of hundreds of billions of dollars</text>
  <text start="545.36" dur="4.229">a year and they want to continue I won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="548.93" dur="3.81">let that happen</text>
  <text start="549.589" dur="5.011">we don&amp;#39;t need China and frankly we would</text>
  <text start="552.74" dur="3.9">be far better off without them</text>
  <text start="554.6" dur="3.69">the vast amounts of money made and</text>
  <text start="556.64" dur="3.99">stolen by China from the United States</text>

  <text start="602.96" dur="8.67">now he is signaling to all companies we</text>
  <text start="608.06" dur="7.02">are going to go through a major reset we</text>
  <text start="611.63" dur="7.46">will be trans and transitioning those</text>

  <text start="639.92" dur="5.06">plan to bring the United States down to</text>
  <text start="642.74" dur="4.92">the level of a third world country and</text>
  <text start="644.98" dur="4.15">they were moving countries out of the</text>
  <text start="647.66" dur="3.54">United States because the United States</text>
  <text start="649.13" dur="5.34">was no longer going to be the reserve</text>

  <text start="662.03" dur="5.45">moved out to China because it was</text>
  <text start="664.64" dur="5.31">inexpensive they needed inexpensive</text>
  <text start="667.48" dur="6.19">manufacturing to keep the system going</text>
  <text start="669.95" dur="5.7">long enough if they kept the companies</text>
  <text start="673.67" dur="4.44">here in the United States manufacturing</text>
  <text start="675.65" dur="5.19">it would just gotten too expensive</text>
  <text start="678.11" dur="6.78">remember the dollar value is decreasing</text>
  <text start="680.84" dur="6.03">to compete with a declining dollar and</text>
  <text start="684.89" dur="2.37">I&amp;#39;m talking about the value of the</text>
  <text start="686.87" dur="3.05">dollar</text>
  <text start="687.26" dur="6.84">you need to have cheaper and cheaper</text>
  <text start="689.92" dur="6.37">manufacturing Trump is saying listen if</text>

  <text start="721.37" dur="8.04">and this is just the beginning do I</text>
  <text start="726.2" dur="5.58">believe that the Fed is going to have</text>
