  <text start="76.63" dur="5.37">economies break down and we saw back in</text>
  <text start="79.48" dur="5.37">the 20s with Germany where we saw</text>
  <text start="82" dur="6.06">hyperinflation we saw a Zimbabwe in the</text>
  <text start="84.85" dur="5.48">late 2000s we&amp;#39;ve seen Argentina where</text>
  <text start="88.06" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;ve seen inflation and now Venezuela</text>
  <text start="90.33" dur="5.62">the IMF is reporting that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="93.1" dur="5.64">to be seeing 1 million percent inflation</text>
  <text start="95.95" dur="5.58">which real and it&amp;#39;s by the year-end</text>
  <text start="98.74" dur="4.25">which really means they won&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="101.53" dur="5.1">use the currency it all will be</text>
  <text start="102.99" dur="6.22">absolutely worthless and this is what</text>
  <text start="106.63" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;re going to see happen here in the</text>
  <text start="109.21" dur="3.6">United States and around the world</text>
  <text start="110.44" dur="5.61">because the debt level the amount of</text>

  <text start="116.05" dur="6.66">short period of time from 2008 up to</text>
  <text start="118.78" dur="7.11">2018 was tremendous and then add on that</text>
  <text start="122.71" dur="6.029">everything before that what we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="125.89" dur="4.71">to see is all these dollars they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="128.739" dur="3.78">going to come home because we see things</text>
  <text start="130.6" dur="4.32">breaking down in the Middle East we see</text>
  <text start="132.519" dur="4.621">things completely breaking down in each</text>
  <text start="134.92" dur="4.98">and every country where the economy is</text>
  <text start="137.14" dur="6.319">not doing well now to put this into</text>
  <text start="139.9" dur="6.24">perspective on how bad things are</text>
  <text start="143.459" dur="5.761">according to financial writer Simon</text>
  <text start="146.14" dur="6.3">Black the federal government is spending</text>
  <text start="149.22" dur="8.23">approximately fifty two thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="152.44" dur="7.47">per second now this not last year&amp;#39;s tax</text>
  <text start="157.45" dur="5.4">cuts is the reason why the national debt</text>
  <text start="159.91" dur="4.65">has reached a record 21 trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="162.85" dur="3.919">which is more than America&amp;#39;s gross</text>
  <text start="164.56" dur="5.34">domestic product which is the GDP</text>
  <text start="166.769" dur="4.841">another anima sign is that this year</text>
  <text start="169.9" dur="4.14">both Social Security and Medicare will</text>
  <text start="171.61" dur="5.31">have to draw down on their reserve funds</text>
  <text start="174.04" dur="4.89">to be able to pay benefits the Social</text>
  <text start="176.92" dur="3.99">Security Medicare trust funds will both</text>
  <text start="178.93" dur="3.99">soon be bankrupt putting additional</text>
  <text start="180.91" dur="5.939">strains on the federal budget and the</text>
  <text start="182.92" dur="4.35">American taxpayers examples of fiscal</text>
  <text start="186.849" dur="3.751">irresponsibility</text>
  <text start="187.27" dur="4.92">ability on Capitol Hill is all over the</text>
  <text start="190.6" dur="4.92">place I mean it&amp;#39;s really not that hard</text>
  <text start="192.19" dur="5.49">to find when the economic crisis hits</text>
  <text start="195.52" dur="3.71">there will be no choice but to cut</text>
  <text start="197.68" dur="4.44">spending and raise taxes of course</text>
  <text start="199.23" dur="5.56">Congress is unlikely to raise taxes or</text>
  <text start="202.12" dur="4.62">cut benefits instead it will rely on the</text>
  <text start="204.79" dur="5.67">Federal Reserve to do the dirty work via</text>
  <text start="206.74" dur="6.39">the inflation tax the inflation tax is</text>
  <text start="210.46" dur="6.12">the worst type of tax because it is both</text>
  <text start="213.13" dur="4.74">hidden and regressive increasing federal</text>
  <text start="216.58" dur="2.88">debt will also put pressure on the</text>
  <text start="217.87" dur="2.96">Federal Reserve to keep interest rates</text>
  <text start="219.46" dur="5.84">low and they&amp;#39;re already talking about</text>
  <text start="220.83" dur="6.91">keeping the rates low around 2020 and</text>
  <text start="225.3" dur="4.33">they&amp;#39;ll keep them low to prevent federal</text>
  <text start="227.74" dur="4.05">interest payments on the debt from</text>
  <text start="229.63" dur="4.14">skyrocketing eventually the feds</text>
  <text start="231.79" dur="4.89">monetization of the debt will lead to</text>
  <text start="233.77" dur="6.5">hyperinflation and rejection of the</text>
  <text start="236.68" dur="6.72">dollars world reserve currency status I</text>
  <text start="240.27" dur="4.63">mean when we start to really understand</text>
  <text start="243.4" dur="4.71">and start to look at what is going on</text>
  <text start="244.9" dur="5.7">here we realize why countries are</text>
  <text start="248.11" dur="4.71">dumping Treasuries why they&amp;#39;re buying</text>
  <text start="250.6" dur="5.699">gold I mean Russia is the perfect</text>
  <text start="252.82" dur="5.91">example Russia has been liquidating the</text>
  <text start="256.299" dur="6.091">US Treasury holdings they&amp;#39;ve been buying</text>
  <text start="258.73" dur="5.88">gold and they haven&amp;#39;t stopped China has</text>
  <text start="262.39" dur="4.02">been purchasing gold India has been</text>
  <text start="264.61" dur="3.39">purchasing gold there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="266.41" dur="3.6">countries that have been repatriated</text>
  <text start="268" dur="3.72">their gold and they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="270.01" dur="4.08">because they understand what is</text>
  <text start="271.72" dur="5.34">happening there remember the central</text>
  <text start="274.09" dur="4.62">bankers they had a plan they wanted</text>
  <text start="277.06" dur="3.21">globalization they wanted a one-world</text>
  <text start="278.71" dur="4.11">government they wanted complete control</text>
  <text start="280.27" dur="3.78">they wanted an even playing field with</text>
  <text start="282.82" dur="3.21">all the countries this is why they</text>
  <text start="284.05" dur="3.75">having the refugees come up to blend</text>
  <text start="286.03" dur="3.81">everyone together to say hey every</text>
  <text start="287.8" dur="4.38">single place is exactly the same there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="289.84" dur="4.02">no difference whatsoever and we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="292.18" dur="4.26">have one country getting pay that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="293.86" dur="4.47">higher than another country country we</text>
  <text start="296.44" dur="4.8">have to bring them all to a level</text>
  <text start="298.33" dur="5.25">playing field that was their goal and</text>
  <text start="301.24" dur="5.16">they were going to have an event to do</text>
  <text start="303.58" dur="4.74">this which is called a war to cover up</text>
  <text start="306.4" dur="4.68">their entire collapse and they were</text>
  <text start="308.32" dur="6.12">going to move the system to another area</text>
  <text start="311.08" dur="6.69">and this area was China they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="314.44" dur="6.67">preparing for this they&amp;#39;ve been creating</text>
  <text start="317.77" dur="8.55">the correct atmosphere</text>
  <text start="321.11" dur="9.6">to have manufacturing to have a trade</text>
  <text start="326.32" dur="7.87">system to have the exchanges it was all</text>
  <text start="330.71" dur="6.06">put into place a long time ago and what</text>
  <text start="334.19" dur="5.82">they had to do over time was they had to</text>
  <text start="336.77" dur="5.58">move the jobs out of the US and if you</text>
  <text start="340.01" dur="3.24">really look back in time this is what</text>
  <text start="342.35" dur="2.85">they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="343.25" dur="3.81">slowly but surely because this was part</text>
  <text start="345.2" dur="4.35">of their plan they didn&amp;#39;t do it in a</text>
  <text start="347.06" dur="4.8">year or two they took many many years to</text>
  <text start="349.55" dur="3.96">do this so no one really noticed and you</text>
  <text start="351.86" dur="3.24">know they created things like NAFTA and</text>
  <text start="353.51" dur="2.79">other things where they said this was</text>
  <text start="355.1" dur="3.09">going to benefit the people we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="356.3" dur="3.27">bring more jobs here and it actually did</text>
  <text start="358.19" dur="3.45">the opposite remember whenever</text>
  <text start="359.57" dur="3.87">government or central banks come out and</text>
  <text start="361.64" dur="4.71">say oh we&amp;#39;re doing this for you and this</text>
  <text start="363.44" dur="4.32">is what it is it&amp;#39;s always the opposite</text>
  <text start="366.35" dur="4.02">the Affordable Care Act it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="367.76" dur="5.37">affordable the Patriot Act has nothing</text>
  <text start="370.37" dur="5.88">to do with Patriots everything that they</text>
  <text start="373.13" dur="6.54">talk about is always the opposite now</text>
  <text start="376.25" dur="4.89">the International Monetary Fund is out</text>
  <text start="379.67" dur="5.61">there and they&amp;#39;re saying that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="381.14" dur="6.93">dollar is overvalued China&amp;#39;s yuan is in</text>
  <text start="385.28" dur="4.77">line with fundamentals and nearly half</text>
  <text start="388.07" dur="5.64">of global current account balances are</text>
  <text start="390.05" dur="6.81">now excessive adding to growth risks and</text>
  <text start="393.71" dur="7.23">trade tensions and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="396.86" dur="6.69">certain countries are in too much debt</text>
  <text start="400.94" dur="6.21">what are these countries well the United</text>
  <text start="403.55" dur="7.62">States Britain turkey Argentina and many</text>
  <text start="407.15" dur="6.27">more and the IMF is saying that there</text>
  <text start="411.17" dur="4.44">aren&amp;#39;t major major problems remember the</text>
  <text start="413.42" dur="3.75">IMF has been talking about you know how</text>
  <text start="415.61" dur="4.89">these tariffs are going to wrecked the</text>
  <text start="417.17" dur="5.22">economy how they&amp;#39;re seeing growth slowed</text>
  <text start="420.5" dur="5.16">it has nothing to do with the tariffs</text>
  <text start="422.39" dur="6.66">what this really means is Trump has been</text>
  <text start="425.66" dur="4.5">ripping apart their globalization plan</text>
  <text start="429.05" dur="3.24">and they don&amp;#39;t like this remember</text>
  <text start="430.16" dur="4.68">central bank&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s in their titles</text>
  <text start="432.29" dur="4.47">central centralization central banks</text>
  <text start="434.84" dur="3.72">they want everything centralized they</text>
  <text start="436.76" dur="3.78">want complete control over everything</text>
  <text start="438.56" dur="4.2">with the World Trade Organization with</text>
  <text start="440.54" dur="3.81">the creation of currency with the</text>
  <text start="442.76" dur="3.93">control of interest rates and everything</text>
  <text start="444.35" dur="4.44">else they have it all centralized this</text>
  <text start="446.69" dur="3.63">is exactly what they wanted from the</text>
  <text start="448.79" dur="3.33">beginning they wanted a one-world</text>
  <text start="450.32" dur="4.6">government they wanted all this together</text>
  <text start="452.12" dur="5.49">and basically this is what they</text>
  <text start="454.92" dur="7.83">shooting for for many many years now</text>
  <text start="457.61" dur="8.8">what Trump is doing he is D globalizing</text>
  <text start="462.75" dur="6.54">the system the globalization effort of</text>
  <text start="466.41" dur="6.74">the last several decades most benefitted</text>
  <text start="469.29" dur="7.05">the owner class not the everyday person</text>
  <text start="473.15" dur="5.05">factories were moved to places where two</text>
  <text start="476.34" dur="4.35">dollars a day workers were unlimited</text>
  <text start="478.2" dur="4.02">while cheap petroleum permitted</text>
  <text start="480.69" dur="3.87">transportation of finished products to</text>
  <text start="482.22" dur="5.25">markets on container ships and trucks</text>
  <text start="484.56" dur="6.33">now think about this everything was</text>
  <text start="487.47" dur="5.58">moved off to other locations around the</text>
  <text start="490.89" dur="4.95">world where they were getting $2 day</text>
  <text start="493.05" dur="5.97">workers to create these products so they</text>
  <text start="495.84" dur="4.77">were moving the manufacturing plants out</text>
  <text start="499.02" dur="3.45">of the United States and remember the</text>
  <text start="500.61" dur="3.72">United States because of unions and</text>
  <text start="502.47" dur="3.81">things like that those workers were</text>
  <text start="504.33" dur="4.17">receiving a like something like $25 per</text>
  <text start="506.28" dur="5.91">hour and in these small towns what</text>
  <text start="508.5" dur="5.22">happened as these manufacturers left you</text>
  <text start="512.19" dur="4.62">know the workers couldn&amp;#39;t find jobs</text>
  <text start="513.72" dur="5.52">since there were no taxes coming in what</text>
  <text start="516.81" dur="5.34">do we see well we saw a layoffs we saw</text>
  <text start="519.24" dur="5.49">our school systems funded by these taxes</text>
  <text start="522.15" dur="5.16">they fell into decay towns fell into</text>
  <text start="524.73" dur="4.44">decay and things started to look really</text>
  <text start="527.31" dur="3.87">bad in America and if you travel the</text>
  <text start="529.17" dur="4.62">country you can see this in many</text>
  <text start="531.18" dur="5.85">different areas but the owner class</text>
  <text start="533.79" dur="6.03">absolutely loved globalization why</text>
  <text start="537.03" dur="4.83">because it benefited them and it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="539.82" dur="5.43">benefit the everyday person it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="541.86" dur="6.3">benefit America at all and then all of a</text>
  <text start="545.25" dur="6.26">sudden Trump is dropped into the</text>
  <text start="548.16" dur="7.85">situation he disrupted trade agreements</text>
  <text start="551.51" dur="8.41">he put forth tariffs sanctions</text>
  <text start="556.01" dur="7.93">threatened almost everyone trashing the</text>
  <text start="559.92" dur="7.47">globalized status quo and all these</text>
  <text start="563.94" dur="6.09">elite they became very very angry and</text>
  <text start="567.39" dur="5.52">you can see why they&amp;#39;re out there and</text>
  <text start="570.03" dur="5.64">this includes the IMF the Fed other</text>
  <text start="572.91" dur="5.1">world leaders who are part of this</text>
  <text start="575.67" dur="3.93">globalization system where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="578.01" dur="3.69">saying that these tariffs are going to</text>
  <text start="579.6" dur="4.71">destroy the economy yes it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="581.7" dur="4.41">destroy what they have been creating all</text>
  <text start="584.31" dur="3.96">along and this is what they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="586.11" dur="2.76">worried about because they have a lot of</text>
  <text start="588.27" dur="2.49">money</text>
  <text start="588.87" dur="5.159">invested in this a lot of time invested</text>
  <text start="590.76" dur="6">in this and Trump you know he&amp;#39;s pissing</text>
  <text start="594.029" dur="6.601">off all the right people and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="596.76" dur="6.44">pissing off many individuals so why is</text>
  <text start="600.63" dur="3.959">he doing this why is he changing</text>
  <text start="603.2" dur="5.02">everything</text>
  <text start="604.589" dur="6.121">well the easy answer is to bring</text>
  <text start="608.22" dur="5.22">manufacturing to bring jobs back to the</text>
  <text start="610.71" dur="5.49">US can this be done overnight no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="613.44" dur="4.53">completely impossible but over time it</text>
  <text start="616.2" dur="3.54">can be done there are certain other</text>
  <text start="617.97" dur="5.4">things that have to be done way before</text>
  <text start="619.74" dur="6.96">that the central banking system needs to</text>
  <text start="623.37" dur="5.659">be removed just like globalization just</text>
  <text start="626.7" dur="4.68">like the World Trade Organization and</text>
  <text start="629.029" dur="3.731">he&amp;#39;s in the process of doing this not</text>
  <text start="631.38" dur="2.88">just him himself there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="632.76" dur="3.09">Patriots behind this a lot of</text>
  <text start="634.26" dur="5.76">individuals that are helping out on this</text>
  <text start="635.85" dur="6.21">and by doing this it can restore what we</text>
  <text start="640.02" dur="3.45">once had here and it&amp;#39;s not going to be</text>
  <text start="642.06" dur="3.3">easy it&amp;#39;s not going to happen overnight</text>
  <text start="643.47" dur="3.869">a lot of people want this to happen</text>
  <text start="645.36" dur="4.979">overnight but it&amp;#39;s just really not going</text>
  <text start="647.339" dur="5.161">to happen and when we look at what is</text>
  <text start="650.339" dur="4.471">happening here you can see at every turn</text>
  <text start="652.5" dur="3.9">these individuals are getting angrier</text>
  <text start="654.81" dur="4.529">and angrier because what they see</text>
  <text start="656.4" dur="5.58">happening here is their system is being</text>
  <text start="659.339" dur="5.461">broken down it&amp;#39;s being ripped apart and</text>
  <text start="661.98" dur="5.07">this is just the beginning stages you</text>
  <text start="664.8" dur="4.44">can&amp;#39;t do everything all at once it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="667.05" dur="4.38">just first of all won&amp;#39;t work you need to</text>
  <text start="669.24" dur="5.16">take it in stages because there&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="671.43" dur="4.95">going to be pushback from the deep state</text>
  <text start="674.4" dur="4.05">from the central banks they&amp;#39;re always</text>
  <text start="676.38" dur="5.28">going to try to stop what is happening</text>
  <text start="678.45" dur="5.28">and you can see right now that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="681.66" dur="5.16">trying to stop this and they will bring</text>
  <text start="683.73" dur="7.02">the economy down to try to stop this and</text>
  <text start="686.82" dur="6.6">blame this entire thing on Trump and the</text>
  <text start="690.75" dur="3.9">Patriots and we could see right now this</text>
  <text start="693.42" dur="2.609">is where we&amp;#39;re getting the two</text>
  <text start="694.65" dur="3.3">narratives right now and this is why</text>
  <text start="696.029" dur="4.591">Trump came out and pointed the finger at</text>
  <text start="697.95" dur="4.56">the Fed and made this small little</text>
  <text start="700.62" dur="3.87">remark about raising interest rates and</text>
  <text start="702.51" dur="4.62">letting the Fed do you know what they</text>
  <text start="704.49" dur="5.219">feel is right he&amp;#39;s setting them up it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="707.13" dur="3.99">actually a really good plan and the</text>
  <text start="709.709" dur="4.101">central bank is on the other side and</text>
  <text start="711.12" dur="6.3">they&amp;#39;re preparing their narrative with</text>
  <text start="713.81" dur="5.769">tariffs the trade economy is now slowing</text>
  <text start="717.42" dur="4.05">because of this and they&amp;#39;re building</text>
  <text start="719.579" dur="2.831">this up and building this up and we can</text>
  <text start="721.47" dur="3.13">see right now</text>
  <text start="722.41" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re using and I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="724.6" dur="4.14">central banks are using whatever method</text>
  <text start="726.13" dur="4.23">they possibly can to stop what Trump is</text>
  <text start="728.74" dur="3.9">doing and the Patriots with what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="730.36" dur="5.43">doing here they know that if he</text>
  <text start="732.64" dur="7.85">continues on this path globalization</text>
  <text start="735.79" dur="7.95">that they planned on will be completely</text>
  <text start="740.49" dur="6.52">disrupted just like the trans-pacific</text>
  <text start="743.74" dur="8.55">partnership this is what this was their</text>
  <text start="747.01" dur="7.38">endgame agreement among nations where</text>
  <text start="752.29" dur="4.35">they were going to have a higher court</text>
  <text start="754.39" dur="5.4">sit above the governments which allow</text>
  <text start="756.64" dur="5.79">them to dictate to governments what they</text>
  <text start="759.79" dur="5.01">wanted and they thought they were going</text>
  <text start="762.43" dur="3.51">to move in that direction that was their</text>
  <text start="764.8" dur="3.75">plan that&amp;#39;s what they thought they were</text>
  <text start="765.94" dur="5.19">going now everything is being reversed</text>
  <text start="768.55" dur="4.62">and they don&amp;#39;t know what to do and the</text>
  <text start="771.13" dur="4.02">only thing they have left really is to</text>
  <text start="773.17" dur="3.87">bring down the economy and try to blame</text>
  <text start="775.15" dur="4.56">Trump make sure he doesn&amp;#39;t get into</text>
  <text start="777.04" dur="4.8">office and put back everything that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="779.71" dur="4.41">done they&amp;#39;re feeling that they&amp;#39;re at a</text>
  <text start="781.84" dur="5.16">point right now where they can repair</text>
  <text start="784.12" dur="4.8">what he did but if he gets elected to</text>
  <text start="787" dur="3.9">another term they know it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="788.92" dur="4.41">game over because he&amp;#39;ll have even more</text>
  <text start="790.9" dur="4.29">time to destroy everything that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="793.33" dur="4.02">done and you can do it very very quickly</text>
  <text start="795.19" dur="4.11">at that point because the process has</text>
  <text start="797.35" dur="5.66">already been started so what we see</text>
  <text start="799.3" dur="5.76">happening right now is that this entire</text>
  <text start="803.01" dur="4.93">globalization this one-world government</text>
  <text start="805.06" dur="4.56">the central bank system it is under</text>
  <text start="807.94" dur="6.03">threat from Trump in the Patriots and</text>
  <text start="809.62" dur="6.24">they are beginning to get angry they</text>
  <text start="813.97" dur="3.36">understand what&amp;#39;s happening and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="815.86" dur="3.9">trying to figure out a way to stop him</text>
  <text start="817.33" dur="3.96">and one way is to bring down the economy</text>
  <text start="819.76" dur="3.51">and I think this is the only thing they</text>
  <text start="821.29" dur="3.45">really have left and I think this is</text>
  <text start="823.27" dur="3.87">where they&amp;#39;re making their move and this</text>
  <text start="824.74" dur="4.29">is why the Fed is hiding the data this</text>
  <text start="827.14" dur="4.05">is why they are recalculating and</text>
  <text start="829.03" dur="5.67">showing us a different yield curve</text>
  <text start="831.19" dur="6.84">hiding the balance sheet information</text>
  <text start="834.7" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re setting everything up so nobody</text>
  <text start="838.03" dur="4.37">looks at them everyone looks at Trump</text>
  <text start="839.89" dur="5.46">Trump is now doing the opposite I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="842.4" dur="4.84">from what has been happening so far with</text>
  <text start="845.35" dur="3.36">the little statement he made in an</text>
  <text start="847.24" dur="4.02">interview they&amp;#39;ve been gathering</text>
  <text start="848.71" dur="4.56">evidence they have a lot of information</text>
  <text start="851.26" dur="3.63">they know what&amp;#39;s going on they know</text>
  <text start="853.27" dur="3.009">what&amp;#39;s been happening in the past and</text>
  <text start="854.89" dur="5.71">they&amp;#39;re going to use this</text>
  <text start="856.279" dur="6.48">against the elite the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="860.6" dur="5.609">when it is time but one thing is for</text>
  <text start="862.759" dur="6.781">sure we will be going through a major</text>
  <text start="866.209" dur="4.531">major transition because the economy</text>
  <text start="869.54" dur="3.18">that were in today</text>
  <text start="870.74" dur="4.62">well you don&amp;#39;t want it to you don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="872.72" dur="4.529">to continue on with it there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="875.36" dur="5.339">for it because you&amp;#39;ll end up in the same</text>
  <text start="877.249" dur="6.981">exact spot allowing the central bankers</text>
  <text start="880.699" dur="7.05">to restart their system from scratch and</text>
  <text start="884.23" dur="5.589">loan governments currency with interest</text>
  <text start="887.749" dur="2.52">attached you&amp;#39;re just back to where you</text>
  <text start="889.819" dur="3.51">started</text>
  <text start="890.269" dur="4.951">the only way for us to get out of this</text>
  <text start="893.329" dur="4.141">is to get rid of the central bank just</text>
  <text start="895.22" dur="3.51">like Andrew Jackson get rid of the</text>
  <text start="897.47" dur="3.089">central banks now that doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="898.73" dur="3.089">there&amp;#39;s going to be other forces that it</text>
  <text start="900.559" dur="2.97">can try to get the central bank&amp;#39;s back</text>
  <text start="901.819" dur="4.14">in they&amp;#39;re always going to be forces</text>
  <text start="903.529" dur="4.05">like this and maybe years and years down</text>
  <text start="905.959" dur="4.56">the line they might succeed just like</text>
  <text start="907.579" dur="6.42">did just like they did in 1913 but for</text>
  <text start="910.519" dur="5.31">right now the plan is to get rid of them</text>
  <text start="913.999" dur="3.421">and everyone needs to be ready and</text>
  <text start="915.829" dur="2.67">prepared because it&amp;#39;s going to be a very</text>
  <text start="917.42" dur="3.45">bumpy ride</text>
