  <text start="62.18" dur="5.04">September 4th 2017 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="64.879" dur="6.061">the episode is the North Korean agenda</text>
  <text start="67.22" dur="5.97">is being pushed how far will it go let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="70.94" dur="4.5">get into the economic collapse political</text>
  <text start="73.19" dur="6.45">and geopolitical news now we know that</text>
  <text start="75.44" dur="8.55">Debbie wasserman-schultz her aide a 1</text>
  <text start="79.64" dur="7.2">and his wife the a Wan&amp;#39;s they were</text>
  <text start="83.99" dur="6.35">indicted and they are now pleading not</text>
  <text start="86.84" dur="6.27">guilty to the charges right now and</text>
  <text start="90.34" dur="4.389">documents that have come forth show that</text>
  <text start="93.11" dur="4.71">there is going to be a larger</text>
  <text start="94.729" dur="5.791">investigation possibly relating to more</text>
  <text start="97.82" dur="4.53">than just matters of bank fraud in a</text>
  <text start="100.52" dur="3.66">letter about evidence in the case the US</text>
  <text start="102.35" dur="4.379">Attorney tranning Phillips described the</text>
  <text start="104.18" dur="5.82">probe as one that even involved</text>
  <text start="106.729" dur="4.95">voluminous discovery citing items that</text>
  <text start="110" dur="3.6">were found in congressional office</text>
  <text start="111.679" dur="4.891">buildings back in April which seemly may</text>
  <text start="113.6" dur="5.64">have belonged to a 1 now one of those</text>
  <text start="116.57" dur="4.619">items was the laptop bag and if you</text>
  <text start="119.24" dur="4.23">remember and you think back Debbie</text>
  <text start="121.189" dur="4.591">wasserman-schultz was very angry at the</text>
  <text start="123.47" dur="4.89">Capitol Hill police chief where she</text>
  <text start="125.78" dur="5.34">berated him she was telling them that</text>
  <text start="128.36" dur="4.98">you can&amp;#39;t have a laptop bag and they</text>
  <text start="131.12" dur="5.22">were looking at this laptop because it</text>
  <text start="133.34" dur="5.22">was part of an investigation and it</text>
  <text start="136.34" dur="5.04">looks like right now that they might be</text>
  <text start="138.56" dur="6.33">going after that and they might be</text>
  <text start="141.38" dur="5.49">looking into that laptop so again</text>
  <text start="144.89" dur="3.27">maybe things are erased off of it maybe</text>
  <text start="146.87" dur="3.929">there are still things on there that</text>
  <text start="148.16" dur="4.919">they can get but we can see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="150.799" dur="4.021">taking the investigation they&amp;#39;re opening</text>
  <text start="153.079" dur="4.111">it up they&amp;#39;re looking at many different</text>
  <text start="154.82" dur="6.06">things because as we&amp;#39;ve seen before that</text>
  <text start="157.19" dur="5.34">there was this huge cover-up and anyone</text>
  <text start="160.88" dur="3.87">who fights so hard to get a piece of</text>
  <text start="162.53" dur="3.78">equipment back there must be something</text>
  <text start="164.75" dur="3.78">on there because if there really wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="166.31" dur="4.679">anything on there you really wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="168.53" dur="4.67">care that much but the way Debbie</text>
  <text start="170.989" dur="7.621">wasserman-schultz was berating the</text>
  <text start="173.2" dur="7.569">police officer we can see that there she</text>
  <text start="178.61" dur="4.74">was very nervous she was very afraid of</text>
  <text start="180.769" dur="5.041">them looking at the laptop and they</text>
  <text start="183.35" dur="2.94">definitely wanted it back we see special</text>
  <text start="185.81" dur="2.759">accounts</text>
  <text start="186.29" dur="5.009">Robert Mueller his team of investigators</text>
  <text start="188.569" dur="5.941">well they seem like they&amp;#39;re leaving no</text>
  <text start="191.299" dur="7.47">stone unturned in their crusade to find</text>
  <text start="194.51" dur="6.089">something they can try to use on Trump</text>
  <text start="198.769" dur="4.17">now it looks like they&amp;#39;re teaming up</text>
  <text start="200.599" dur="5.161">with IRS is criminal investigation unit</text>
  <text start="202.939" dur="4.951">the elite IRS investigation squad will</text>
  <text start="205.76" dur="5.19">help ensure that the investigators apply</text>
  <text start="207.89" dur="5.73">the maximum possible scrutiny to the</text>
  <text start="210.95" dur="5.429">finances of Trump&amp;#39;s inner circle and it</text>
  <text start="213.62" dur="5.67">looks like this is going way past the</text>
  <text start="216.379" dur="5.19">Russian collusion right now and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="219.29" dur="4.71">pushing the agenda to look into the</text>
  <text start="221.569" dur="4.771">finances look into the taxes and it</text>
  <text start="224" dur="4.68">seems like they&amp;#39;re really going off the</text>
  <text start="226.34" dur="4.709">track the beaten track here of what</text>
  <text start="228.68" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re supposed to be doing and the</text>
  <text start="231.049" dur="4.951">reason for this is because they really</text>
  <text start="233.06" dur="5.789">can&amp;#39;t find anything now out in North</text>
  <text start="236" dur="4.799">Korea we see over this weekend over the</text>
  <text start="238.849" dur="5.401">Labor Day weekend and by the way happy</text>
  <text start="240.799" dur="6.931">Labor Day to everyone we see that North</text>
  <text start="244.25" dur="5.28">Korea well out in the news they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="247.73" dur="4.289">saying there was this earthquake and</text>
  <text start="249.53" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re saying that North Korea</text>
  <text start="252.019" dur="5.161">developed the h-bomb and we can see that</text>
  <text start="255.5" dur="2.97">it&amp;#39;s all over the corporate media Trump</text>
  <text start="257.18" dur="3.839">is out there saying that you know we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="258.47" dur="3.81">see what&amp;#39;s going to happen and we see</text>
  <text start="261.019" dur="3.451">that you know many people are saying</text>
  <text start="262.28" dur="3.72">that we&amp;#39;re heading towards war Russia</text>
  <text start="264.47" dur="4.47">and China are out there saying that</text>
  <text start="266" dur="6.72">listen we know that Trump and manoosh in</text>
  <text start="268.94" dur="6.509">they want sanctions on North Korea we</text>
  <text start="272.72" dur="4.979">see that Trump wants to ban anyone that</text>
  <text start="275.449" dur="3.96">is training with North Korea but again</text>
  <text start="277.699" dur="3.391">Russia and China are saying listen all</text>
  <text start="279.409" dur="4.561">these sanctions they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="281.09" dur="4.62">work and we could see at this point they</text>
  <text start="283.97" dur="4.41">haven&amp;#39;t worked and we need to remember</text>
  <text start="285.71" dur="7.29">something very important is that North</text>
  <text start="288.38" dur="7.95">Korea once again is out there testing</text>
  <text start="293" dur="6.3">different missiles different nuclear</text>
  <text start="296.33" dur="5.369">weapons but there&amp;#39;s really been no proof</text>
  <text start="299.3" dur="5.19">but the corporate media is really</text>
  <text start="301.699" dur="4.53">playing this up right now and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="304.49" dur="3.69">trying to make everyone believe that</text>
  <text start="306.229" dur="4.41">this is actually happening now</text>
  <text start="308.18" dur="5.609">we&amp;#39;ve seen an earthquake happen once</text>
  <text start="310.639" dur="4.89">before in North Korea and they said it</text>
  <text start="313.789" dur="4.171">was a nuclear weapon tested underground</text>
  <text start="315.529" dur="4.501">and there was no radiation or anything</text>
  <text start="317.96" dur="3.72">detected to prove that it</text>
  <text start="320.03" dur="3.42">and I&amp;#39;m not saying it&amp;#39;s for this period</text>
  <text start="321.68" dur="3.62">of time it was last time this happened</text>
  <text start="323.45" dur="5.31">and just because there&amp;#39;s an earthquake</text>
  <text start="325.3" dur="5.41">it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that there was a nuclear</text>
  <text start="328.76" dur="4.35">test now of course the corporate media</text>
  <text start="330.71" dur="5.43">they like to come out and say yes it was</text>
  <text start="333.11" dur="5.25">a nuclear weapon test we see that your</text>
  <text start="336.14" dur="4.32">nap news from South Korea they just</text>
  <text start="338.36" dur="5.7">automatically came out and said yes it</text>
  <text start="340.46" dur="5.34">was a nuclear weapon and we could see</text>
  <text start="344.06" dur="5.43">that they&amp;#39;re pushing this very very hard</text>
  <text start="345.8" dur="6.51">we see that South Korea they are</text>
  <text start="349.49" dur="5.99">thinking about bringing in maybe a US</text>
  <text start="352.31" dur="6.03">carrier and they&amp;#39;re talking about maybe</text>
  <text start="355.48" dur="4.689">bringing in more thadd missile systems</text>
  <text start="358.34" dur="3.84">and of course this is what the corporate</text>
  <text start="360.169" dur="3.931">media is out there telling everyone that</text>
  <text start="362.18" dur="5.31">yes they&amp;#39;re getting ready to ramp up</text>
  <text start="364.1" dur="4.98">military assets in this area now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="367.49" dur="3.72">an additional news story where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="369.08" dur="4.56">saying that North Korea is making</text>
  <text start="371.21" dur="4.709">preparations for another ICBM launch and</text>
  <text start="373.64" dur="4.74">this is coming from South Korea saying</text>
  <text start="375.919" dur="4.831">yes this is what they&amp;#39;re about to do so</text>
  <text start="378.38" dur="3.81">really what we need to do is we need to</text>
  <text start="380.75" dur="3.45">look at this and understand what is</text>
  <text start="382.19" dur="4.92">going on first of all Chinese President</text>
  <text start="384.2" dur="5.21">Xi Jinping and Putin they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="387.11" dur="5.73">saying listen we need to come together</text>
  <text start="389.41" dur="5.23">with South Korea North Korea the United</text>
  <text start="392.84" dur="3.72">States we need to have a diplomatic</text>
  <text start="394.64" dur="3.779">solution to all of this and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="396.56" dur="3.63">interesting about all of this is that</text>
  <text start="398.419" dur="3.541">China and Russia I mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="400.19" dur="4.59">bordering North Korea they should be</text>
  <text start="401.96" dur="5.49">very worried about these nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="404.78" dur="5.61">and what they&amp;#39;re looking to do is have</text>
  <text start="407.45" dur="5.01">talks what the Cabal really wants to do</text>
  <text start="410.39" dur="3.6">and we knew this was going to happen we</text>
  <text start="412.46" dur="3.78">knew they were going to push the agenda</text>
  <text start="413.99" dur="3.69">we knew they had a certain timeframe to</text>
  <text start="416.24" dur="2.04">do it and they&amp;#39;re really coming down to</text>
  <text start="417.68" dur="4.23">the wire</text>
  <text start="418.28" dur="5.16">to try to push this event and we can see</text>
  <text start="421.91" dur="3.45">right now that they&amp;#39;re pushing very hard</text>
  <text start="423.44" dur="5.16">but China and Russia they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="425.36" dur="5.67">holding to a some type of diplomatic</text>
  <text start="428.6" dur="5.55">solution and they want all parties to</text>
  <text start="431.03" dur="5.07">come together we have nikki Haley who is</text>
  <text start="434.15" dur="4.8">the United Nations ambassador out there</text>
  <text start="436.1" dur="6.2">and she is saying that enough is enough</text>
  <text start="438.95" dur="7.83">North Korea&amp;#39;s leader Jim Kim jong-un is</text>
  <text start="442.3" dur="7.57">begging for war and she says the time</text>
  <text start="446.78" dur="5.67">for talk is over it&amp;#39;s too late there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="449.87" dur="4.05">no we can&amp;#39;t have any type of diplomatic</text>
  <text start="452.45" dur="4.62">talks or anything like that</text>
  <text start="453.92" dur="7.38">it&amp;#39;s time to go in there now think about</text>
  <text start="457.07" dur="6.27">what she&amp;#39;s saying she is a part of the</text>
  <text start="461.3" dur="5.55">Cabal the deep state she deals in</text>
  <text start="463.34" dur="5.82">absolutes and who wants to have a war</text>
  <text start="466.85" dur="4.83">because this will not end well for</text>
  <text start="469.16" dur="4.2">anyone because we know if the United</text>
  <text start="471.68" dur="3.66">States goes in there and let&amp;#39;s say there</text>
  <text start="473.36" dur="4.44">is some type of an event we know that</text>
  <text start="475.34" dur="4.71">China and Russia they&amp;#39;ll stand by for a</text>
  <text start="477.8" dur="3.99">short period of time but they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="480.05" dur="3.65">just gonna stand by and let the United</text>
  <text start="481.79" dur="4.44">States take over North Korea and</text>
  <text start="483.7" dur="5.35">basically move right up to their borders</text>
  <text start="486.23" dur="4.67">it&amp;#39;s not going to happen so we need to</text>
  <text start="489.05" dur="4.85">understand what is happening here</text>
  <text start="490.9" dur="6.91">because I think we&amp;#39;ve seen this before</text>
  <text start="493.9" dur="5.56">we it seems to be no end to the</text>
  <text start="497.81" dur="3.99">escalation of tensions between North</text>
  <text start="499.46" dur="6.21">Korea and the United States we see North</text>
  <text start="501.8" dur="5.64">Korea well they came out declaring what</text>
  <text start="505.67" dur="5.04">it claims was another successful test</text>
  <text start="507.44" dur="4.53">this time a hydrogen bomb and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="510.71" dur="4.8">saying that they can mount this on an</text>
  <text start="511.97" dur="6">ICBM missile and of course they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="515.51" dur="5.58">have an ICBM missile they have</text>
  <text start="517.97" dur="4.89">medium-range missiles still there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="521.09" dur="4.83">independent verification of the claim</text>
  <text start="522.86" dur="5.61">but the corporate media they found this</text>
  <text start="525.92" dur="4.14">opportunity to get out there and to push</text>
  <text start="528.47" dur="4.05">this agenda remember the corporate media</text>
  <text start="530.06" dur="5.97">is part of the Cabal it&amp;#39;s the mouthpiece</text>
  <text start="532.52" dur="7.08">of the cabal so they&amp;#39;re pushing the idea</text>
  <text start="536.03" dur="5.25">very very hard and of course there was</text>
  <text start="539.6" dur="5.13">an earthquake so they were able to hook</text>
  <text start="541.28" dur="6.09">that to this nuclear test and we could</text>
  <text start="544.73" dur="5.28">see right now that first of all there is</text>
  <text start="547.37" dur="5.76">no proof right now they don&amp;#39;t have an</text>
  <text start="550.01" dur="5.4">ICBM they have missiles that blow up in</text>
  <text start="553.13" dur="5.64">the sky they don&amp;#39;t have missiles that</text>
  <text start="555.41" dur="5.37">can actually fly long distances but why</text>
  <text start="558.77" dur="4.68">should this stop the corporate media and</text>
  <text start="560.78" dur="4.5">the Cabal from pushing their agenda I</text>
  <text start="563.45" dur="4.46">mean think about this they were so</text>
  <text start="565.28" dur="5.37">confident the mainstream media outlet</text>
  <text start="567.91" dur="4.51">like the Financial Times and many of CNN</text>
  <text start="570.65" dur="4.16">and all the others that they actually</text>
  <text start="572.42" dur="6.12">were out there saying that yes you know</text>
  <text start="574.81" dur="5.08">North Korea just tested an h-bomb and</text>
  <text start="578.54" dur="3.6">they put it in quotes and they made</text>
  <text start="579.89" dur="7.02">everyone believe didn&amp;#39;t we hear this</text>
  <text start="582.14" dur="5.67">before didn&amp;#39;t we hear that Iraq had</text>
  <text start="586.91" dur="3.15">weapons of mass</text>
  <text start="587.81" dur="5.19">destruction and they showed us the pink</text>
  <text start="590.06" dur="5.219">powder didn&amp;#39;t they tell us all of this</text>
  <text start="593" dur="3.9">didn&amp;#39;t they also tell us that Syria was</text>
  <text start="595.279" dur="5.851">using chemical weapons on their own</text>
  <text start="596.9" dur="8.04">people this is the same exact pattern to</text>
  <text start="601.13" dur="7.86">get us into war and if you notice they</text>
  <text start="604.94" dur="7.38">are building this up to the point where</text>
  <text start="608.99" dur="6.66">people say yes we need to stop them but</text>
  <text start="612.32" dur="6.03">what has North Korea actually done have</text>
  <text start="615.65" dur="5.46">they attacked the United States no have</text>
  <text start="618.35" dur="6.32">they attacked any allies no have they</text>
  <text start="621.11" dur="5.419">attacked South Korea no they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="624.67" dur="5.65">absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="626.529" dur="7.481">how serious is this threat it&amp;#39;s not that</text>
  <text start="630.32" dur="7.17">serious they&amp;#39;re making it bigger than</text>
  <text start="634.01" dur="6.48">life why because they want to create</text>
  <text start="637.49" dur="6.3">some type of an event if they can create</text>
  <text start="640.49" dur="6.45">this event they want to bring us to war</text>
  <text start="643.79" dur="5.01">that&amp;#39;s the whole point of this just like</text>
  <text start="646.94" dur="4.17">they did this with a rack just like they</text>
  <text start="648.8" dur="5.52">just did this with 9/11 just like they</text>
  <text start="651.11" dur="5.94">did it with Libya it&amp;#39;s the same exact</text>
  <text start="654.32" dur="5.16">tactic just a different country they did</text>
  <text start="657.05" dur="5.19">it with Ukraine and they&amp;#39;re gonna keep</text>

  <text start="662.24" dur="3.87">push anymore so they&amp;#39;re gonna keep</text>
  <text start="663.53" dur="4.8">adding sanctions they&amp;#39;re gonna tell us</text>
  <text start="666.11" dur="4.44">that North Korea is the bad guys we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="668.33" dur="3.78">the good guys in all of this that this</text>
  <text start="670.55" dur="3.75">needs to be stopped or they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="672.11" dur="5.64">attack and they&amp;#39;re gonna continue this</text>
  <text start="674.3" dur="5.31">on until they can create some type of an</text>
  <text start="677.75" dur="3.72">event because what they need to do at</text>
  <text start="679.61" dur="5.04">this point since they really don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="681.47" dur="4.89">a nuclear weapon since they really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="684.65" dur="3.21">have a missile that can fly long-range</text>
  <text start="686.36" dur="4.05">and of course they&amp;#39;re gonna use the one</text>
  <text start="687.86" dur="5.07">that they flew over Japan as oh they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="690.41" dur="3.81">just on the cusp of creating an ICBM</text>
  <text start="692.93" dur="2.99">that can reach the United States they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="694.22" dur="4.29">already saying that of course and</text>
  <text start="695.92" dur="4.09">they&amp;#39;re already showing everyone that</text>
  <text start="698.51" dur="5.1">they can put a nuclear weapon so we</text>
  <text start="700.01" dur="6.36">might even see an event where there</text>
  <text start="703.61" dur="4.95">might be some type of explosion in the</text>
  <text start="706.37" dur="4.2">ocean maybe heading toward Japan may be</text>
  <text start="708.56" dur="4.469">heading to Guam because they already let</text>
  <text start="710.57" dur="4.11">us know that North Korea is going to</text>
  <text start="713.029" dur="3.781">fire a missile at Guam now I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="714.68" dur="5.01">supply&amp;#39;s surprised if they fire a</text>
  <text start="716.81" dur="3.57">missile maybe there&amp;#39;s a new a tiny nuke</text>
  <text start="719.69" dur="3.27">on there</text>
  <text start="720.38" dur="5.34">and it blows up right before it gets to</text>
  <text start="722.96" dur="5.34">Guam or maybe Japan or someplace around</text>
  <text start="725.72" dur="4.56">this area to show that they do have the</text>
  <text start="728.3" dur="3.45">ability to do this and the question we</text>
  <text start="730.28" dur="2.01">all have to ask ourselves if this does</text>
  <text start="731.75" dur="4.92">happen</text>
  <text start="732.29" dur="6.84">why would North Korea do this because</text>
  <text start="736.67" dur="5.79">think of what is going to happen to</text>
  <text start="739.13" dur="6.33">North Korea it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not a smart</text>
  <text start="742.46" dur="4.5">strategic move and they&amp;#39;re not stupid</text>
  <text start="745.46" dur="3.54">he&amp;#39;s not crazy</text>
  <text start="746.96" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re not going to destroy their own</text>
  <text start="749" dur="7.35">country it makes no sense they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="751.61" dur="7.59">have the military to basically go out</text>
  <text start="756.35" dur="5.22">and you know invade other countries they</text>
  <text start="759.2" dur="4.29">do they have a lot of defense type of</text>
  <text start="761.57" dur="5.22">equipment but they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="763.49" dur="6.75">military and the manpower to do this</text>
  <text start="766.79" dur="5.49">it&amp;#39;s completely impossible but the</text>
  <text start="770.24" dur="5.34">corporate media the Cabal they want you</text>
  <text start="772.28" dur="7.02">to believe all of this we see out in</text>
  <text start="775.58" dur="7.11">Syria the Syrian army they have seized</text>
  <text start="779.3" dur="4.98">more of the Jordanian border and we</text>
  <text start="782.69" dur="4.77">could see right now that the Islamic</text>
  <text start="784.28" dur="7.5">state well they are cut off they are</text>
  <text start="787.46" dur="7.53">trapped we see the 17 buses 300 Islamic</text>
  <text start="791.78" dur="4.89">state fighters and a couple of family</text>
  <text start="794.99" dur="5.28">members of the Islamic state while they</text>
  <text start="796.67" dur="7.56">are stuck in the middle of Syria no way</text>
  <text start="800.27" dur="6.33">out and we can see right now it looks</text>
  <text start="804.23" dur="4.83">like Russia and the Syrian Armed Forces</text>
  <text start="806.6" dur="5.07">they pretty much have everything under</text>
  <text start="809.06" dur="4.68">control in Syria right now it seems like</text>
  <text start="811.67" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s our huge cleanup mission right now</text>
  <text start="813.74" dur="3.96">and they&amp;#39;re just going through the</text>
  <text start="815.15" dur="5.07">country they&amp;#39;re controlling the borders</text>
  <text start="817.7" dur="4.83">and Syria looks like it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="820.22" dur="4.92">off the table right now the same thing</text>
  <text start="822.53" dur="5.61">with Libya the same thing with Iraq the</text>
  <text start="825.14" dur="7.83">only thing that Cabal has left is North</text>
  <text start="828.14" dur="6.81">Korea and we knew that this period of</text>
  <text start="832.97" dur="3.96">time from August to Labor Day they were</text>
  <text start="834.95" dur="4.23">going to try to push their agenda now</text>
  <text start="836.93" dur="4.74">once again they just couldn&amp;#39;t come out</text>
  <text start="839.18" dur="4.8">and have some type of an event because</text>
  <text start="841.67" dur="5.34">there was no proof or no verification</text>
  <text start="843.98" dur="4.77">that North Korea could actually that</text>
  <text start="847.01" dur="3.78">North Korea actually has a nuclear</text>
  <text start="848.75" dur="3.36">weapon that North Korea actually has a</text>
  <text start="850.79" dur="2.46">ballistic missile because everything</text>
  <text start="852.11" dur="1.74">that Russia has been pointing out</text>
  <text start="853.25" dur="2.279">everything</text>
  <text start="853.85" dur="3.39">that China&amp;#39;s been pointing out is that</text>
  <text start="855.529" dur="4.891">every time they launched a missile</text>
  <text start="857.24" dur="6.81">it is a medium-range missile and it</text>
  <text start="860.42" dur="6.96">never really finished its flight</text>
  <text start="864.05" dur="6.029">trajectory it blew up before it actually</text>
  <text start="867.38" dur="4.86">hit the target in the water and never</text>
  <text start="870.079" dur="4.32">really flew the way they wanted it to</text>
  <text start="872.24" dur="3.26">fly and they&amp;#39;ve been launching a lot of</text>
  <text start="874.399" dur="4.74">these and a lot of them have been</text>
  <text start="875.5" dur="6.819">complete duds and in the case of a</text>
  <text start="879.139" dur="5.31">nuclear type of weapon well they really</text>
  <text start="882.319" dur="6.151">haven&amp;#39;t proven to anyone that they</text>
  <text start="884.449" dur="6.661">actually have one yes we hear from the</text>
  <text start="888.47" dur="5.22">corporate media in South Korea telling</text>
  <text start="891.11" dur="5.55">us that they actually have one but</text>
  <text start="893.69" dur="5.31">there&amp;#39;s no actual verification we always</text>
  <text start="896.66" dur="4.799">have to come back to the proof and this</text>
  <text start="899" dur="4.589">is where propaganda well this is where</text>
  <text start="901.459" dur="6.06">it all falls apart because they can</text>
  <text start="903.589" dur="7.141">never show the proof and if they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="907.519" dur="5.641">back up anything they&amp;#39;re saying yes they</text>
  <text start="910.73" dur="4.77">have the headlines yes they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="913.16" dur="5.489">us all of this but I think the American</text>
  <text start="915.5" dur="5.759">people today they need the proof that</text>
  <text start="918.649" dur="5.13">this is why we&amp;#39;re going to war and guess</text>
  <text start="921.259" dur="3.57">what is going to happen they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="923.779" dur="3.151">going to be able to show the proof</text>
  <text start="924.829" dur="4.711">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to manufacture proof</text>
  <text start="926.93" dur="4.92">and try to show you that this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="929.54" dur="4.409">happening but they&amp;#39;re actually not going</text>
  <text start="931.85" dur="6.39">to have proof because what happens now</text>
  <text start="933.949" dur="6.271">in today&amp;#39;s world China Russia as usual</text>
  <text start="938.24" dur="3.779">they will step in and say no and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="940.22" dur="5.309">not really true because remember they</text>
  <text start="942.019" dur="5.611">are monitoring the border of North Korea</text>
  <text start="945.529" dur="4.11">what&amp;#39;s going on in this area because</text>
  <text start="947.63" dur="4.23">they border North Korea they know</text>
  <text start="949.639" dur="4.081">exactly what&amp;#39;s going on and if the</text>
  <text start="951.86" dur="4.14">United States says something the Cabal</text>
  <text start="953.72" dur="4.14">says something they&amp;#39;re going to say well</text>
  <text start="956" dur="3.75">this isn&amp;#39;t what we&amp;#39;re seeing it</text>
  <text start="957.86" dur="5.19">conflicts with what you&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="959.75" dur="5.22">and right now Russia China they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="963.05" dur="4.44">out there saying yes this is absolutely</text>
  <text start="964.97" dur="4.5">confirmed the last nuclear test with the</text>
  <text start="967.49" dur="3.99">earthquake they&amp;#39;ve never really</text>
  <text start="969.47" dur="4.83">confirmed that this was actually</text>
  <text start="971.48" dur="4.2">happening because we got information</text>
  <text start="974.3" dur="5.01">saying that they haven&amp;#39;t picked up any</text>
  <text start="975.68" dur="6">type of radioactive material or anything</text>
  <text start="979.31" dur="4.35">like that or there is really no proof</text>
  <text start="981.68" dur="3.42">that they can show that this is exactly</text>
  <text start="983.66" dur="3.78">what happened yes there was an</text>
  <text start="985.1" dur="3.99">earthquake but again</text>
  <text start="987.44" dur="4.79">countries have earthquakes there all</text>
  <text start="989.09" dur="6.6">around the world you need to show proof</text>
  <text start="992.23" dur="5.89">but again the Cabal they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="995.69" dur="4.77">show proof they want to use propaganda</text>
  <text start="998.12" dur="4.47">they want to get us into war so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1000.46" dur="4.67">thinking at this point they&amp;#39;re building</text>
  <text start="1002.59" dur="5.97">this up you&amp;#39;re putting it out there and</text>
  <text start="1005.13" dur="6.34">the next stage of all of this is to have</text>
  <text start="1008.56" dur="6.12">some type of an event because they know</text>
  <text start="1011.47" dur="4.98">as this economy comes down the central</text>
  <text start="1014.68" dur="3.42">bank will guess what they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="1016.45" dur="3.69">be blamed for this they know they have</text>
  <text start="1018.1" dur="4.02">to get us into war to cover up all of</text>
  <text start="1020.14" dur="3.72">this they know that they could say that</text>
  <text start="1022.12" dur="4.199">we&amp;#39;re on a wartime economy this is why</text>
  <text start="1023.86" dur="3.75">things look like the way they do they</text>
  <text start="1026.319" dur="3.571">can say this is why we&amp;#39;re not getting</text>
  <text start="1027.61" dur="4.29">supplies into the United States this is</text>
  <text start="1029.89" dur="4.35">why credit is freezing up it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1031.9" dur="4.71">because of North Korea and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1034.24" dur="4.199">easy for them to point fingers in other</text>
  <text start="1036.61" dur="3.87">places this is why the economy is coming</text>
  <text start="1038.439" dur="4.081">down this is why the world is such a</text>
  <text start="1040.48" dur="3.18">mess right now and this is what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1042.52" dur="2.61">been trying to do because as we get</text>
  <text start="1043.66" dur="3.57">closer and closer to this collapse</text>
  <text start="1045.13" dur="3.93">scenario they&amp;#39;re gonna push even harder</text>
  <text start="1047.23" dur="4.05">and harder and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="1049.06" dur="4.32">this but what the problem is is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1051.28" dur="3.75">running out of places to do this because</text>
  <text start="1053.38" dur="4.29">the Islamic state is finished al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="1055.03" dur="5.22">is finished Syria no-go</text>
  <text start="1057.67" dur="4.26">all the other countries no-go all they</text>
  <text start="1060.25" dur="3.24">have left right now is North Korea</text>
  <text start="1061.93" dur="4.35">unless they start something up someplace</text>
  <text start="1063.49" dur="4.68">else but right now this is the only</text>
  <text start="1066.28" dur="4.35">place they can convince people and</text>
  <text start="1068.17" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re gonna push this as hard as they</text>
