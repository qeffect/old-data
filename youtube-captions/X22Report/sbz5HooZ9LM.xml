  <text start="115.28" dur="6.06">Nokia they&amp;#39;re getting ready to cut</text>
  <text start="118.369" dur="6.451">between 10,000 and 15,000 jobs worldwide</text>

  <text start="124.82" dur="6.03">doing very very well no it shows us that</text>
  <text start="127.1" dur="5.88">here&amp;#39;s another company where sales are</text>
  <text start="130.85" dur="4.65">declining they need to get rid of people</text>
  <text start="132.98" dur="5.34">and we&amp;#39;re just going to lump them in</text>
  <text start="135.5" dur="5.37">with the rest of the companies and if we</text>
  <text start="138.32" dur="5.55">go back to jun 2014 to the present time</text>
  <text start="140.87" dur="5.04">were over a million people that have</text>
  <text start="143.87" dur="5.16">been laid off this numbers just getting</text>
  <text start="145.91" dur="8.1">larger and larger as we move forward now</text>
  <text start="149.03" dur="9.319">the market was pushed up today on the</text>
  <text start="154.01" dur="8.04">news that housing surged out of nowhere</text>
  <text start="158.349" dur="6.011">northeast home sales soared unexpectedly</text>
  <text start="162.05" dur="6.96">to 36,000</text>
  <text start="164.36" dur="7.38">march to 55,000 in April unexplained</text>
  <text start="169.01" dur="4.35">fifty-three percent spike now does this</text>
  <text start="171.74" dur="4.26">make sense to anyone because I look up</text>
  <text start="173.36" dur="6.42">in the Northeast and you know what I see</text>
  <text start="176" dur="5.16">I see a lot of homes on the market I see</text>
  <text start="179.78" dur="4.59">a lot of homes on the market for nine</text>
  <text start="181.16" dur="5.46">ten months I see houses that started at</text>
  <text start="184.37" dur="4.53">seven hundred thousand they&amp;#39;re down to</text>
  <text start="186.62" dur="4.56">six hundred and ten thousand I see</text>
  <text start="188.9" dur="3.99">houses that are at six hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="191.18" dur="4.59">thousand they are down to five hundred</text>
  <text start="192.89" dur="6.12">and fifty nine thousand on the market</text>
  <text start="195.77" dur="6.5">very long and we need to think about</text>
  <text start="199.01" dur="6.21">what they&amp;#39;re trying to say at this point</text>
  <text start="202.27" dur="5.35">they&amp;#39;re trying to say that the consumers</text>
  <text start="205.22" dur="4.32">here in the United States are not</text>
  <text start="207.62" dur="4.29">spending in retail and this is why the</text>
  <text start="209.54" dur="5.13">retail numbers are so doubt as the</text>
  <text start="211.91" dur="6.21">declining continually they keep telling</text>
  <text start="214.67" dur="6.3">us through the corporate media that the</text>
  <text start="218.12" dur="5.61">consumers are to blame so consumers</text>
  <text start="220.97" dur="5.519">aren&amp;#39;t going out and purchasing you know</text>
  <text start="223.73" dur="4.259">these knickknacks at all these different</text>
  <text start="226.489" dur="4.611">stores and the stores are laying off</text>
  <text start="227.989" dur="7.53">people they&amp;#39;re closing up they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="231.1" dur="8.85">contracting but the same people one out</text>
  <text start="235.519" dur="7.671">and they rush to purchase a home where a</text>
  <text start="239.95" dur="6.819">meeting no new home sale prices around</text>
  <text start="243.19" dur="6.82">321,000 does this make any sense to</text>
  <text start="246.769" dur="5.431">anyone of course it doesn&amp;#39;t so the</text>
  <text start="250.01" dur="5.94">people don&amp;#39;t have the money to go out</text>
  <text start="252.2" dur="7.05">and buy clothing to go out and purchase</text>
  <text start="255.95" dur="6.36">food go out and purchase maybe a little</text>
  <text start="259.25" dur="6.18">electronic device but they have enough</text>
  <text start="262.31" dur="6.419">money to go out and spend on a monthly</text>
  <text start="265.43" dur="4.86">payment of course this doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="268.729" dur="3.781">sense so when you look at the mortgage</text>
  <text start="270.29" dur="4.26">applications it doesn&amp;#39;t support what</text>
  <text start="272.51" dur="6.69">just happened so what just happened how</text>
  <text start="274.55" dur="8.01">how did the housing-market increase out</text>
  <text start="279.2" dur="8.42">of nowhere these were hedge funds</text>
  <text start="282.56" dur="6.24">investment companies banks builders</text>
  <text start="287.62" dur="4.509">assisting</text>
  <text start="288.8" dur="8.369">and selling off the rest of their homes</text>
  <text start="292.129" dur="8.88">and what happened here is they were able</text>
  <text start="297.169" dur="8.87">to push these numbers up remember the</text>
  <text start="301.009" dur="8.731">central bankers they chose certain areas</text>
  <text start="306.039" dur="6.821">because they know the agencies are going</text>
  <text start="309.74" dur="5.19">to look in certain cities to see if</text>
  <text start="312.86" dur="4.41">prices are going up to see if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="314.93" dur="6.919">home sales existing home sales new home</text>
  <text start="317.27" dur="7.949">sales but all the other outlying areas</text>
  <text start="321.849" dur="6.551">they didn&amp;#39;t care about because no one</text>
  <text start="325.219" dur="6.721">was ever going to report on those so if</text>
  <text start="328.4" dur="6.449">they can control those markets they can</text>
  <text start="331.94" dur="6.659">control the housing markets in those</text>
  <text start="334.849" dur="5.37">area by having money pumped into the</text>
  <text start="338.599" dur="3.141">system and having these hedge funds and</text>
  <text start="340.219" dur="6.151">investment companies foreign investors</text>
  <text start="341.74" dur="7.06">purchase homes and the banks keep</text>
  <text start="346.37" dur="5.81">foreclosures off the market and have the</text>
  <text start="348.8" dur="6.66">Fed continually by up toxic real estate</text>
  <text start="352.18" dur="7.539">they have a recipe here to create a</text>
  <text start="355.46" dur="7.319">housing bubble that looks real and all</text>
  <text start="359.719" dur="6.361">of this is part of the illusion of this</text>
  <text start="362.779" dur="6.031">economy now the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="366.08" dur="5.339">pushing the idea that housing is back on</text>
  <text start="368.81" dur="6.599">track this is why the market is soaring</text>
  <text start="371.419" dur="6.661">everything looks fantastic but we know</text>
  <text start="375.409" dur="4.891">what&amp;#39;s going to happen next month</text>
  <text start="378.08" dur="3.809">they&amp;#39;re going to revise the numbers next</text>
  <text start="380.3" dur="5.459">month we&amp;#39;re going to see this huge drop</text>
  <text start="381.889" dur="5.851">in new home sales the market most likely</text>
  <text start="385.759" dur="5.071">in the next couple of days will drop to</text>
  <text start="387.74" dur="6.03">300 points to backward back down to</text>
  <text start="390.83" dur="6.929">where it was we&amp;#39;ll see gold start to</text>
  <text start="393.77" dur="5.369">rise once again because what the US</text>
  <text start="397.759" dur="4.951">government central bankers are doing</text>
  <text start="399.139" dur="6.93">they&amp;#39;re continually manipulating the</text>
  <text start="402.71" dur="5.4">environment and when they manipulate it</text>
  <text start="406.069" dur="5.041">it looks good for a short period of time</text>
  <text start="408.11" dur="5.549">and then they can&amp;#39;t control it and then</text>
  <text start="411.11" dur="7.369">the real economic indicators the real</text>
  <text start="413.659" dur="6.91">people in the market the real system</text>
  <text start="418.479" dur="4.731">does a little correction</text>
  <text start="420.569" dur="4.05">and it falls back down to where it was</text>
  <text start="423.21" dur="4.319">and this is what we&amp;#39;re going to say</text>
  <text start="424.619" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;ve seen it every single time because</text>
  <text start="427.529" dur="5.13">when we look at all these economic</text>
  <text start="428.729" dur="5.791">indicators nothing&amp;#39;s changed absolutely</text>
  <text start="432.659" dur="4.77">nothing has changed actually it has</text>
  <text start="434.52" dur="5.759">changed it&amp;#39;s gotten worse we are seeing</text>
  <text start="437.429" dur="5.48">all major economies they are</text>
  <text start="440.279" dur="6.39">experiencing a manufacturing slow down</text>
  <text start="442.909" dur="5.081">even a prolonged recession and in few</text>
  <text start="446.669" dur="4.83">cases something closer to a</text>
  <text start="447.99" dur="7.709">manufacturing depression and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="451.499" dur="6.301">seeing right now is that the America</text>
  <text start="455.699" dur="5.43">problem with manufacturing isn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="457.8" dur="6.299">strong dollar but it&amp;#39;s the global demand</text>
  <text start="461.129" dur="7.62">for manufacturing goods that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="464.099" dur="7.71">hammering all major economies we see the</text>
  <text start="468.749" dur="7.53">bowl to dry index it fell to 618 points</text>
  <text start="471.809" dur="8.58">it is down six points now during this</text>
  <text start="476.279" dur="6.09">time period we see the smart money out</text>
  <text start="480.389" dur="4.8">there and for the 17th consecutive week</text>
  <text start="482.369" dur="5.22">they are selling off now this is a</text>
  <text start="485.189" dur="3.6">pattern where we&amp;#39;re seeing people</text>
  <text start="487.589" dur="4.711">continually getting out of the market</text>
  <text start="488.789" dur="6.72">and something very interesting just</text>
  <text start="492.3" dur="5.099">happen the media is out there and</text>
  <text start="495.509" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re continually claiming that the</text>
  <text start="497.399" dur="7.56">only sectors in trouble of a slowdown</text>
  <text start="499.769" dur="8.73">are commodity players energy sectors but</text>
  <text start="504.959" dur="5.88">this really isn&amp;#39;t true because we have</text>
  <text start="508.499" dur="9.241">to remember since 2008 2009 during the</text>
  <text start="510.839" dur="9.721">Great Recession companies the world we</text>
  <text start="517.74" dur="6.209">see they&amp;#39;re on a massive borrowing binge</text>
  <text start="520.56" dur="6.42">since that time period and when we look</text>
  <text start="523.949" dur="8.25">at the US corporate bond market we see</text>
  <text start="526.98" dur="7.049">since 2008 it has gone vertical after</text>
  <text start="532.199" dur="4.921">the Fed cut their rates they started</text>
  <text start="534.029" dur="6.06">printing money handing out free money to</text>
  <text start="537.12" dur="5.61">companies to banks and it just</text>
  <text start="540.089" dur="5.25">skyrocketed now to put this into</text>
  <text start="542.73" dur="4.74">perspective this means that the quality</text>
  <text start="545.339" dur="5.131">of corporate bonds being issued today is</text>
  <text start="547.47" dur="5.369">lower than it was during and right after</text>
  <text start="550.47" dur="3.75">the 2008 meltdown now when we look at</text>
  <text start="552.839" dur="4.711">the default rate</text>
  <text start="554.22" dur="6.99">we see the default rate here in 2016</text>
  <text start="557.55" dur="8.1">they are on track to outpace the default</text>
  <text start="561.21" dur="6.18">rate back in 2009 and if you believe the</text>
  <text start="565.65" dur="5.37">defaults are going to be isolated to the</text>
  <text start="567.39" dur="6.18">engine energy companies well that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="571.02" dur="5.4">mistake corporate leverage has</text>
  <text start="573.57" dur="7.89">skyrocketed in the last four years it</text>
  <text start="576.42" dur="8.7">has gotten worse and worse and right now</text>
  <text start="581.46" dur="6.63">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is the build-up to</text>
  <text start="585.12" dur="7.62">this gigantic eruption that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="588.09" dur="7.05">occur and if you look back in time and</text>
  <text start="592.74" dur="5.4">we go back to 2008 around the month of</text>
  <text start="595.14" dur="5.31">July and August we have seen this before</text>
  <text start="598.14" dur="4.95">we&amp;#39;ve seen the market being pumped up</text>
  <text start="600.45" dur="5.25">where people set up everything is fine</text>
  <text start="603.09" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s all contained nothing to worry</text>
  <text start="605.7" dur="7.08">about the economy is doing absolutely</text>
  <text start="607.98" dur="7.74">fine actually back in 1929 the same</text>
  <text start="612.78" dur="4.29">exact scenario where the market was</text>
  <text start="615.72" dur="3">pumped back up people thought everything</text>
  <text start="617.07" dur="4.23">was fine and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="618.72" dur="4.29">everything came crashing down and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="621.3" dur="5.82">going to see the same thing occur once</text>
  <text start="623.01" dur="7.64">again because this time the market is at</text>
  <text start="627.12" dur="6.78">a point where we&amp;#39;ve never seen it before</text>
  <text start="630.65" dur="5.82">the manipulation is so great it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="633.9" dur="5.82">something that we&amp;#39;ve never seen before</text>
  <text start="636.47" dur="5.88">we can&amp;#39;t even comprehend what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="639.72" dur="5.7">right now because the manipulation and</text>
  <text start="642.35" dur="6.04">gold in the stock market in a derivative</text>
  <text start="645.42" dur="6.03">market in the bond market around the</text>
  <text start="648.39" dur="8.57">world with the economies of the world it</text>
  <text start="651.45" dur="10.23">is so great right now and so manipulated</text>
  <text start="656.96" dur="6.91">when this falls it&amp;#39;s going to come down</text>
  <text start="661.68" dur="7.11">fast and hard I don&amp;#39;t think this is</text>
  <text start="663.87" dur="9.42">going to be a slow drawn-out type of</text>
  <text start="668.79" dur="7.77">collapse because in the past there get</text>
  <text start="673.29" dur="6.15">there&amp;#39;s a point where they just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="676.56" dur="7.56">keep it together and things just break</text>
  <text start="679.44" dur="7.29">and this happens with everything that</text>
  <text start="684.12" dur="4.089">we&amp;#39;ve seen in the past where everyone</text>
  <text start="686.73" dur="3.789">thought no no they can keep this going</text>
  <text start="688.209" dur="4.261">now how everything is contained there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="690.519" dur="5.281">nothing to worry about well we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="692.47" dur="5.64">that this is not true we&amp;#39;ve seen that</text>
  <text start="695.8" dur="4.139">when they tell us this when they tell us</text>
  <text start="698.11" dur="4.889">that everything is fine when they tell</text>

  <text start="708.189" dur="5.221">we&amp;#39;re starting to realize that yeah when</text>
