  <text start="147.67" dur="5.91">there&amp;#39;s a lot in these texts that</text>
  <text start="150.54" dur="6.279">everyone needs to see because that will</text>
  <text start="153.58" dur="6.15">explain all of what has been happening</text>
  <text start="156.819" dur="5.731">and who was running what who was doing</text>

  <text start="580.72" dur="5.73">exactly what they were doing it looks</text>
  <text start="583.21" dur="5.47">like now that France is moving closer</text>

  <text start="992.97" dur="8.039">nuclear deal alive and the conditions</text>
  <text start="996.48" dur="6.299">are as follows in general they need to</text>
  <text start="1001.009" dur="4.921">stand Europe needs to stand up against</text>

  <text start="1016.1" dur="5.969">program the other two conditions are</text>
  <text start="1019.069" dur="5.311">generally economical insisting European</text>
  <text start="1022.069" dur="4.62">banks should safeguard trade with Iran</text>

  <text start="1040.52" dur="7.799">demands of Pompeo now Pompeo is list is</text>
  <text start="1043.64" dur="7.2">quite crazy but Putin took a portion of</text>

  <text start="1065.57" dur="4.44">think this is the general direction</text>
  <text start="1067.46" dur="5.599">they&amp;#39;re going in because once Iran is</text>
  <text start="1070.01" dur="5.58">gone the US and the coalition forces</text>

  <text start="1089.69" dur="3.56">do with the deep state there because</text>
  <text start="1090.98" dur="5.449">what what will they do well they&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="1093.25" dur="5.71">distractions like events false flags</text>
  <text start="1096.429" dur="4.661">they might even go deeper than that and</text>
  <text start="1098.96" dur="4.949">have something even larger so you have</text>
  <text start="1101.09" dur="6.6">to dance around them and trap these</text>
  <text start="1103.909" dur="7.441">people France also recognizes that</text>
  <text start="1107.69" dur="5.609">Russia&amp;#39;s new role in the Middle East is</text>
  <text start="1111.35" dur="5.28">very important they have an</text>
  <text start="1113.299" dur="5.731">international relations role in the</text>
  <text start="1116.63" dur="4.14">Middle East so France is already</text>
  <text start="1119.03" dur="4.95">dealing with Russia making deals</text>
  <text start="1120.77" dur="5.31">economically they&amp;#39;re also recognizing</text>
  <text start="1123.98" dur="4.7">Russia&amp;#39;s new role in international</text>
  <text start="1126.08" dur="6.57">relations including the Middle East</text>
  <text start="1128.68" dur="8.16">letting the world know that Russia is</text>
  <text start="1132.65" dur="7.47">the controlling force in these areas and</text>
  <text start="1136.84" dur="5.11">most likely the rest of the European</text>
  <text start="1140.12" dur="7.74">nations are going to have to deal with</text>
  <text start="1141.95" dur="8.01">Russia not the u.s. in these areas this</text>
  <text start="1147.86" dur="5.19">is very interesting because we could see</text>
  <text start="1149.96" dur="4.92">what is happening here Russia China</text>
  <text start="1153.05" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re gonna end up calling the shots</text>
  <text start="1154.88" dur="4.59">in this entire area and there&amp;#39;ll be no</text>
  <text start="1157.37" dur="4.59">reason for the u.s. to be in this area</text>
  <text start="1159.47" dur="4.44">what at all actually Russian China been</text>
  <text start="1161.96" dur="5.19">setting up a lot of bilateral trades in</text>
  <text start="1163.91" dur="6.12">this area making economic deals with</text>
  <text start="1167.15" dur="6.09">these countries also bringing them in to</text>
  <text start="1170.03" dur="5.22">the one belt one road system we see</text>
  <text start="1173.24" dur="3.24">right now that the us-backed forces they</text>
  <text start="1175.25" dur="3.78">arrested one of the most dangerous</text>
  <text start="1176.48" dur="4.65">European Islamic state members if you</text>
  <text start="1179.03" dur="4.92">notice these individuals are now being</text>
  <text start="1181.13" dur="6.3">arrested and the arrested French</text>
  <text start="1183.95" dur="6.54">terrorist is adrian lionel chi ali also</text>
  <text start="1187.43" dur="5.16">known as abu osama and this individual</text>
  <text start="1190.49" dur="4.35">was arrested he was trying to escape to</text>
  <text start="1192.59" dur="5.58">Turkey before he was apprehended by the</text>
  <text start="1194.84" dur="6.27">us back forces this weekend so they have</text>
  <text start="1198.17" dur="6.15">them Iraq also caught the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1201.11" dur="7.7">the whole thing is falling apart very</text>
  <text start="1204.32" dur="8.91">very rapidly now US Senator Jeff Merkley</text>
  <text start="1208.81" dur="6.37">he introduced a new bill and basically</text>
  <text start="1213.23" dur="4.56">this is going to ensure that Congress</text>
  <text start="1215.18" dur="5.01">must vote proactively before the</text>
  <text start="1217.79" dur="3.87">president can start and expand wars with</text>
  <text start="1220.19" dur="4.59">the authorization for use of military</text>
  <text start="1221.66" dur="5.91">force which I completely agree with that</text>
  <text start="1224.78" dur="6.09">the president should have to go through</text>
  <text start="1227.57" dur="5.7">Congress and Congress should vote before</text>
  <text start="1230.87" dur="4.2">the president can do anything but again</text>
  <text start="1233.27" dur="5.01">they put this authorization for US</text>
  <text start="1235.07" dur="5.55">military force after 9/11 so they can go</text>
  <text start="1238.28" dur="4.02">after al-qaeda which really means they</text>
  <text start="1240.62" dur="4.98">wanted to go after those individuals</text>
  <text start="1242.3" dur="5.22">that were going to resist regime change</text>
  <text start="1245.6" dur="4.08">in those countries so they can call</text>
  <text start="1247.52" dur="4.74">those individuals al-qaeda and they can</text>
  <text start="1249.68" dur="5.25">use force against those people and</text>
  <text start="1252.26" dur="5.49">then Hayden using this for everything</text>
  <text start="1254.93" dur="5.76">and I think it&amp;#39;s time where this needs</text>
  <text start="1257.75" dur="4.8">to go away completely because this is</text>
  <text start="1260.69" dur="4.77">really not part of the Constitution</text>
  <text start="1262.55" dur="5.49">Congress votes if we should go to war</text>
  <text start="1265.46" dur="5.4">and it was done purposely for the people</text>
  <text start="1268.04" dur="4.5">to decide if we should go to war I mean</text>
  <text start="1270.86" dur="4.68">this authorization for use of military</text>
  <text start="1272.54" dur="6.75">force it should have never been pushed</text>
  <text start="1275.54" dur="6.48">out there and used and they did it on</text>
  <text start="1279.29" dur="4.89">purpose because they knew they were</text>
  <text start="1282.02" dur="4.29">going to have to use military force in</text>
  <text start="1284.18" dur="3.9">all these countries and they didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1286.31" dur="2.73">Congress to vote on each one of them</text>
  <text start="1288.08" dur="3.18">because they knew what was going to</text>
  <text start="1289.04" dur="7.14">happen so they needed something else and</text>
  <text start="1291.26" dur="7.32">they created all of this to convince the</text>
  <text start="1296.18" dur="5.25">world that we&amp;#39;re going after terrorists</text>
  <text start="1298.58" dur="5.67">and it&amp;#39;s okay and then they used a free</text>
  <text start="1301.43" dur="5.07">and pretty much everything else so we</text>
  <text start="1304.25" dur="2.7">see right now the deep state is in</text>
  <text start="1306.5" dur="2.58">trouble</text>
  <text start="1306.95" dur="4.74">it looks like the deep state is being</text>
  <text start="1309.08" dur="4.53">trapped that corporate media is being</text>
