  <text start="109.97" dur="4.92">political and geopolitical news now it</text>
  <text start="112.97" dur="5.67">looks like the deep state the elite</text>
  <text start="114.89" dur="6.869">essential banks the bad guys they are</text>
  <text start="118.64" dur="6">grasping at anything they possibly can</text>
  <text start="121.759" dur="4.56">and we can see all over the corporate</text>
  <text start="124.64" dur="4.35">media it&amp;#39;s all over the place we</text>
  <text start="126.319" dur="5.761">discussed it yesterday where we have</text>
  <text start="128.99" dur="5.67">Donald Trump jr. where the New York</text>
  <text start="132.08" dur="5.37">Times reported that there were these</text>
  <text start="134.66" dur="6.45">emails now remember they never really</text>
  <text start="137.45" dur="8.1">had the emails they never saw them they</text>
  <text start="141.11" dur="7.62">were basically told about them read to</text>
  <text start="145.55" dur="6.47">them by these different sources now the</text>
  <text start="148.73" dur="6.93">question is where did these individuals</text>
  <text start="152.02" dur="7.75">get these emails did they get it from</text>
  <text start="155.66" dur="6.93">someone maybe from the FBI from the NSA</text>
  <text start="159.77" dur="7.32">did they get them from Rob Goldstone</text>
  <text start="162.59" dur="7.38">he&amp;#39;s the intermediary that basically</text>
  <text start="167.09" dur="6.6">handled the emails between Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="169.97" dur="5.94">jr. and this Russian lawyer and he was</text>
  <text start="173.69" dur="4.26">writing back and forth because this</text>
  <text start="175.91" dur="4.799">individual he&amp;#39;s one he&amp;#39;s a publicist and</text>
  <text start="177.95" dur="5.01">a former British tabloid reporter who</text>
  <text start="180.709" dur="5.461">basically helped broker all this back in</text>
  <text start="182.96" dur="3.9">June of 2016 so the times that never</text>
  <text start="186.17" dur="3.57">actually</text>
  <text start="186.86" dur="5.7">had the email so Donald Trump jr.</text>
  <text start="189.74" dur="4.29">decided you know something for the sake</text>
  <text start="192.56" dur="4.65">of transparency I&amp;#39;m just going to</text>
  <text start="194.03" dur="6.3">release and show everyone the emails and</text>
  <text start="197.21" dur="4.59">this is exactly what he did he put it</text>
  <text start="200.33" dur="2.76">out on Twitter and said here are the</text>
  <text start="201.8" dur="4.77">emails this is what everyone&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="203.09" dur="7.08">about and inside this it said that this</text>
  <text start="206.57" dur="7.44">lawyer had incriminated incriminating</text>
  <text start="210.17" dur="6.81">evidence against hillary and her</text>
  <text start="214.01" dur="6.06">dealings with russia and it would be</text>
  <text start="216.98" dur="6.9">very useful to Donald Trump who was</text>
  <text start="220.07" dur="6.9">running for president and again it came</text>
  <text start="223.88" dur="6.03">from Rob Goldstone and he acted as an</text>
  <text start="226.97" dur="6.83">intermediary between these two</text>
  <text start="229.91" dur="7.44">individuals now when we think about this</text>
  <text start="233.8" dur="5.53">Donald Trump jr. said you know okay if</text>
  <text start="237.35" dur="5.16">you have information I would love to see</text>
  <text start="239.33" dur="5.49">it why not now the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="242.51" dur="6.84">out there saying AHA we got them</text>
  <text start="244.82" dur="6.36">this is collusion well Donald Trump jr.</text>
  <text start="249.35" dur="4.889">was he really part of the campaign back</text>
  <text start="251.18" dur="3.57">in June actually this is way before all</text>
  <text start="254.239" dur="3.961">of this</text>
  <text start="254.75" dur="7.109">Russian hysteria and the email actually</text>
  <text start="258.2" dur="7.49">came from Goldstone who was working and</text>
  <text start="261.859" dur="6.301">talking about this now was he the one</text>
  <text start="265.69" dur="6.49">making up all of this because the</text>
  <text start="268.16" dur="5.64">Russian lawyer said no I don&amp;#39;t have this</text>
  <text start="272.18" dur="5.85">information I never promised this</text>
  <text start="273.8" dur="7.67">information and what the emails show and</text>
  <text start="278.03" dur="7.139">what she wanted to talk about was about</text>
  <text start="281.47" dur="7.12">the restrictions on adoption of Russian</text>
  <text start="285.169" dur="8.701">children so this is very confusing</text>
  <text start="288.59" dur="9.18">because what Rob Goldstone was telling</text>
  <text start="293.87" dur="6.27">Donald Trump jr. is different when than</text>
  <text start="297.77" dur="3.899">what the Russian lawyer is saying so</text>
  <text start="300.14" dur="5.07">then we have to ask this question was</text>
  <text start="301.669" dur="5.581">Goldstone setting up Donald Trump jr.</text>
  <text start="305.21" dur="4.53">for something I mean this is what it</text>
  <text start="307.25" dur="4.8">seems like but let&amp;#39;s go further into</text>
  <text start="309.74" dur="6.06">this now there the corporate media</text>
  <text start="312.05" dur="6.299">they&amp;#39;re talking about collusion they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="315.8" dur="4.98">talking about treason they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="318.349" dur="5.221">haha we have it now remember</text>
  <text start="320.78" dur="4.44">Trump was never party to any of this you</text>
  <text start="323.57" dur="3.78">can even know about the meeting he had</text>
  <text start="325.22" dur="4.44">no knowledge of it whatsoever and the</text>
  <text start="327.35" dur="3.81">email does not refer to any cooperation</text>
  <text start="329.66" dur="3.21">coordination or collusion between the</text>
  <text start="331.16" dur="4.74">Trump campaign and the Russian</text>
  <text start="332.87" dur="4.89">government now this lawyer from Russia</text>
  <text start="335.9" dur="4.44">says that she&amp;#39;s not part of the</text>
  <text start="337.76" dur="5.34">government whatsoever she was on NBC she</text>
  <text start="340.34" dur="5.13">was being interviewed and she was asked</text>
  <text start="343.1" dur="3.63">directly do you have any ties to the</text>
  <text start="345.47" dur="3.72">Russian government she said absolutely</text>
  <text start="346.73" dur="3.99">not I don&amp;#39;t actually the Russian</text>
  <text start="349.19" dur="3.3">government came out and said yeah we</text>
  <text start="350.72" dur="3.81">don&amp;#39;t know who this lawyer is now just</text>
  <text start="352.49" dur="4.08">because you&amp;#39;re Russian and you&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="354.53" dur="4.5">that you have information which we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="356.57" dur="3.51">know if she actually did because we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="359.03" dur="2.76">never seen it</text>
  <text start="360.08" dur="4.23">she&amp;#39;s never produced it she said she</text>
  <text start="361.79" dur="6.12">never had it only Goldstone said there</text>
  <text start="364.31" dur="6.24">was information there&amp;#39;s a huge hole in</text>
  <text start="367.91" dur="4.08">this entire story now the corporate</text>
  <text start="370.55" dur="4.38">media is out there and they keep talking</text>
  <text start="371.99" dur="5.64">about collusion now the definition of</text>
  <text start="374.93" dur="6.12">collusion is secret agreement or</text>
  <text start="377.63" dur="6.09">cooperation especially for an illegal or</text>
  <text start="381.05" dur="5.49">deceitful purpose acting in collusion</text>
  <text start="383.72" dur="6.54">with the enemy well number one there was</text>
  <text start="386.54" dur="7.41">no secret agreement or cooperation for</text>
  <text start="390.26" dur="6.659">an illegal or deceitful purpose and why</text>
  <text start="393.95" dur="6.45">is the Russian attorney the enemy enemy</text>
  <text start="396.919" dur="4.021">of who she&amp;#39;s not part of the Russian</text>
  <text start="400.4" dur="3.42">government</text>
  <text start="400.94" dur="5.07">she&amp;#39;s just an attorney so that really</text>
  <text start="403.82" dur="4.32">doesn&amp;#39;t fit into collusion now treason</text>
  <text start="406.01" dur="3.54">I&amp;#39;ve heard on the corporate media that</text>
  <text start="408.14" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re talking about well this could</text>
  <text start="409.55" dur="5.58">lead to treason well the definition of</text>
  <text start="412.37" dur="4.41">treason is the offense of attempting by</text>
  <text start="415.13" dur="4.409">overt acts to overthrow the government</text>
  <text start="416.78" dur="5.49">of the state to which the offender owes</text>
  <text start="419.539" dur="4.711">allegiance or to kill or personally</text>
  <text start="422.27" dur="4.89">injure the sovereign or the sovereigns</text>
  <text start="424.25" dur="5.28">family well he&amp;#39;s not overthrowing any</text>
  <text start="427.16" dur="5.6">type of government there&amp;#39;s no overthrow</text>
  <text start="429.53" dur="6.18">and he&amp;#39;s not pledging allegiance or</text>
  <text start="432.76" dur="5.86">trying to kill or personally injure this</text>
  <text start="435.71" dur="5.34">sovereign or the sovereigns family so</text>
  <text start="438.62" dur="4.169">again this doesn&amp;#39;t fit what the</text>
  <text start="441.05" dur="6.69">corporate media is talking about and</text>
  <text start="442.789" dur="7.741">once again there is nothing here yes the</text>
  <text start="447.74" dur="6.419">corporate media the bad guys the deep</text>
  <text start="450.53" dur="4.62">state they love to tell you how bad it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="454.159" dur="2.731">going to be there</text>
  <text start="455.15" dur="3.93">great at doing this they&amp;#39;re great at</text>
  <text start="456.89" dur="4.92">fear-mongering and making you think</text>
  <text start="459.08" dur="5.16">there&amp;#39;s something there when there is</text>
  <text start="461.81" dur="4.86">absolutely nothing they&amp;#39;re great at</text>
  <text start="464.24" dur="4.59">showing you that terrorists are coming</text>
  <text start="466.67" dur="4.74">to get us even though they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="468.83" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re great at telling you what North</text>
  <text start="471.41" dur="5.43">Korea is doing even though they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="474.14" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;re great at showing that Russia is</text>
  <text start="476.84" dur="6.24">getting ready to attack even though they</text>
  <text start="479.96" dur="5.52">are not this is what these individuals</text>
  <text start="483.08" dur="5.58">do you know why because they&amp;#39;re hiding</text>
  <text start="485.48" dur="5.73">everything that they have done this is</text>
  <text start="488.66" dur="5.82">why they&amp;#39;re trying to basically take</text>
  <text start="491.21" dur="6.51">everyone&amp;#39;s eyes and shift them to a</text>
  <text start="494.48" dur="5.7">different location this way you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="497.72" dur="4.08">look at unmasking this way you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="500.18" dur="5.51">look at the leaked classified</text>
  <text start="501.8" dur="6.21">information that Comey gave out this way</text>
  <text start="505.69" dur="5.14">you don&amp;#39;t see what Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="508.01" dur="5.46">actually did this way you don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="510.83" dur="5.88">anything that they&amp;#39;ve been doing this is</text>
  <text start="513.47" dur="5.31">why they continually do this now John</text>
  <text start="516.71" dur="5.37">McCain he has called in for questioning</text>
  <text start="518.78" dur="5.31">in the Trump dossier lawsuit now</text>
  <text start="522.08" dur="4.86">remember he&amp;#39;s the one who handed it over</text>
  <text start="524.09" dur="3.87">and said yes we have something and here</text>
  <text start="526.94" dur="4.35">it is and it turned out to be completely</text>
  <text start="527.96" dur="5.91">fake and right now he&amp;#39;s being called</text>
  <text start="531.29" dur="5.16">into question because right now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="533.87" dur="4.89">a lawsuit and this is part of a</text>
  <text start="536.45" dur="4.38">defamation lawsuit regarding his role in</text>
  <text start="538.76" dur="4.95">the leaking of the opposition research</text>
  <text start="540.83" dur="6.45">dossier for from a former British spy</text>
  <text start="543.71" dur="5.22">Chris steel which he compiled on Trump</text>
  <text start="547.28" dur="4.98">which turned out to be completely fake</text>
  <text start="548.93" dur="7.5">phony and false so already we have</text>
  <text start="552.26" dur="7.2">McCain being questioned we have all eyes</text>
  <text start="556.43" dur="6.9">on Comey we have some type of</text>
  <text start="559.46" dur="7.08">investigation on Loretta Lynch on Susan</text>
  <text start="563.33" dur="5.46">Rice on Obama on the whole unmasking</text>
  <text start="566.54" dur="5.34">thing if you really look at what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="568.79" dur="6.63">on here all these things are starting to</text>
  <text start="571.88" dur="5.01">come out slowly but surely it&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="575.42" dur="3.48">out to the public and what the deep</text>
  <text start="576.89" dur="4.35">state is doing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="578.9" dur="5.94">trying to basically distract everyone</text>
  <text start="581.24" dur="5.64">from the real issues they&amp;#39;re never going</text>
  <text start="584.84" dur="4.02">to run these stories about all of this</text>
  <text start="586.88" dur="4.71">stuff they&amp;#39;re going to bury</text>
  <text start="588.86" dur="5.07">and hide it they don&amp;#39;t want anyone to</text>
  <text start="591.59" dur="5.19">know about what&amp;#39;s really going on they</text>
  <text start="593.93" dur="4.83">want to keep everyone busy and thinking</text>
  <text start="596.78" dur="4.71">that there&amp;#39;s Russian collusion there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="598.76" dur="6.75">some type of conspiracy when the real</text>
  <text start="601.49" dur="6.72">crime is with the pedo ring it&amp;#39;s with</text>
  <text start="605.51" dur="4.71">the unmasking it&amp;#39;s with all the leaking</text>
  <text start="608.21" dur="5.28">all the laws that have been broken and</text>
  <text start="610.22" dur="6.29">this is just what we&amp;#39;re seeing here this</text>
  <text start="613.49" dur="6.09">is just a small snapshot when this</text>
  <text start="616.51" dur="4.99">eventually hopefully blows open we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="619.58" dur="4.59">going to see things that we&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="621.5" dur="5.01">even thought of so basically what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="624.17" dur="3.39">happening right now is their time is</text>
  <text start="626.51" dur="4.41">coming to an end</text>
  <text start="627.56" dur="4.68">they are scared right now because</text>
  <text start="630.92" dur="3.93">there&amp;#39;s too much of this information</text>
  <text start="632.24" dur="4.26">coming out and they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="634.85" dur="5.13">grasping at anything they possibly can</text>
  <text start="636.5" dur="6.57">to distract to stop this from happening</text>
  <text start="639.98" dur="5.43">and the corporate media they&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="643.07" dur="5.58">going to let up with Russia Russia</text>
  <text start="645.41" dur="6.12">Russia because their mission is to get</text>
  <text start="648.65" dur="5.88">Trump period that&amp;#39;s it they want to keep</text>
  <text start="651.53" dur="6.51">them busy with this stuff they want the</text>
  <text start="654.53" dur="5.79">people of America to continually hear</text>
  <text start="658.04" dur="4.41">this this is the way they brainwash</text>
  <text start="660.32" dur="4.14">America we&amp;#39;re just going to repeat</text>
  <text start="662.45" dur="4.71">Russian collusion over and over and over</text>
  <text start="664.46" dur="3.99">and over until you believe us and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="667.16" dur="4.8">going to spread this on every single</text>
  <text start="668.45" dur="6.57">network until you believe and this is</text>
  <text start="671.96" dur="5.04">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do now Russia is</text>
  <text start="675.02" dur="6.09">out there and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="677" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;re going to expel 30 US diplomats</text>
  <text start="681.11" dur="5.22">and seize us</text>
  <text start="682.73" dur="6.3">assets now remember Trump Putin they</text>
  <text start="686.33" dur="4.95">spoke with each other and of course the</text>
  <text start="689.03" dur="4.62">corporate media well they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="691.28" dur="3.42">sitting in on the conversation and I do</text>
  <text start="693.65" dur="5.28">believe that they&amp;#39;ve been working</text>
  <text start="694.7" dur="7.01">together all this time and we have to</text>
  <text start="698.93" dur="7.05">understand who are they actually</text>
  <text start="701.71" dur="6.76">expelling in the u.s. in Russia and what</text>
  <text start="705.98" dur="4.29">assets are they freezing do you think</text>
  <text start="708.47" dur="3.6">it&amp;#39;s the good guys or do you think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="710.27" dur="5.16">the bad guys do you think this was</text>
  <text start="712.07" dur="5.1">pre-planned because it took Russia quite</text>
  <text start="715.43" dur="4.65">a while and it&amp;#39;s very interesting how</text>
  <text start="717.17" dur="5.46">it&amp;#39;s coming out right after this meeting</text>
  <text start="720.08" dur="3.93">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="722.63" dur="4.14">and I know a lot of people want to see a</text>
  <text start="724.01" dur="4.44">lot more they want to see Jeff Sessions</text>
  <text start="726.77" dur="3.15">they want to see Trump well Trump really</text>
  <text start="728.45" dur="3.66">can&amp;#39;t do anything as president can&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="729.92" dur="4.41">hey let&amp;#39;s go after this person he has to</text>
  <text start="732.11" dur="3.99">hand it off to the FBI actually as they</text>
  <text start="734.33" dur="3.45">hand it off to the Justice Department</text>
  <text start="736.1" dur="3.69">that will get the FBI to investigate and</text>
  <text start="737.78" dur="3.84">that&amp;#39;s how that process really needs to</text>
  <text start="739.79" dur="3.51">work but a lot of people are saying well</text>
  <text start="741.62" dur="3.36">this is not moving fast enough we need</text>
  <text start="743.3" dur="4.86">to move a lot faster on this and we need</text>
  <text start="744.98" dur="6.32">to have a incredible investigation well</text>
  <text start="748.16" dur="6.3">we&amp;#39;re so used to thinking that</text>
  <text start="751.3" dur="5.53">investigations happen in a split second</text>
  <text start="754.46" dur="3.87">because the corporate media when they</text>
  <text start="756.83" dur="4.35">come out with their information let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="758.33" dur="4.38">say North Korean hacking they come out</text>
  <text start="761.18" dur="3.33">with their information in a day or so</text>
  <text start="762.71" dur="4.02">saying yes we did an investigation it</text>
  <text start="764.51" dur="4.14">was North Korea that that hacked Sony</text>
  <text start="766.73" dur="3.39">yes we did an investigation it was</text>
  <text start="768.65" dur="4.23">Russia who did this</text>
  <text start="770.12" dur="6.3">these aren&amp;#39;t true investigations a true</text>
  <text start="772.88" dur="7.65">investigation is done in private a true</text>
  <text start="776.42" dur="5.61">investigation is done meticulously to</text>
  <text start="780.53" dur="4.41">make sure that you get all the</text>
  <text start="782.03" dur="5.73">information and if they&amp;#39;re beginning it</text>
  <text start="784.94" dur="6.54">may be back in February may be back in</text>
  <text start="787.76" dur="6.45">March it&amp;#39;s going to take time it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="791.48" dur="5.48">happen the next day you need to make</text>
  <text start="794.21" dur="4.89">sure you get all the information and</text>
  <text start="796.96" dur="4.66">believe me the corporate media is not</text>
  <text start="799.1" dur="5.52">going to be out there broadcasting that</text>
  <text start="801.62" dur="4.71">all this is going on they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="804.62" dur="4.41">people to know about this so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="806.33" dur="5.39">never going to let anyone know now</text>
  <text start="809.03" dur="6.65">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that is real</text>
  <text start="811.72" dur="6.31">well they came out with a bizarre</text>
  <text start="815.68" dur="5.29">confrontation where they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="818.03" dur="6.27">Israel is calling George Soros a threat</text>
  <text start="820.97" dur="6.33">to democratic governments and Israel is</text>
  <text start="824.3" dur="5.34">going after George Soros now what I</text>
  <text start="827.3" dur="4.83">think is happening right now is that all</text>
  <text start="829.64" dur="4.71">these bad guys around the world they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="832.13" dur="4.47">getting nervous and they want to</text>
  <text start="834.35" dur="4.98">separate themselves from these</text>
  <text start="836.6" dur="6.36">individuals because this is what happens</text>
  <text start="839.33" dur="6">when things go the opposite way where</text>
  <text start="842.96" dur="4.95">things are starting to come down around</text>
  <text start="845.33" dur="4.98">bad guys they start turning on each</text>
  <text start="847.91" dur="5.28">other and this is what we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="850.31" dur="5.52">see right now because we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="853.19" dur="3.36">see that all these individuals they are</text>
  <text start="855.83" dur="4.59">nerve</text>
  <text start="856.55" dur="5.52">and afraid because they know that more</text>
  <text start="860.42" dur="2.82">of this information is continually</text>
  <text start="862.07" dur="3.03">coming out you might not see it in the</text>
  <text start="863.24" dur="4.11">corporate media but more of it is</text>
  <text start="865.1" dur="4.739">continually coming out and once the</text>
  <text start="867.35" dur="4.5">Justice Department once all of this does</text>
  <text start="869.839" dur="3">come out and they actually make an</text>
  <text start="871.85" dur="3.45">announcement that they&amp;#39;re going after</text>
  <text start="872.839" dur="5.31">someone well we&amp;#39;re going to see things</text>
  <text start="875.3" dur="5.31">change completely now we see the u.s.</text>
  <text start="878.149" dur="5.491">they intercepted a ballistic missile in</text>
  <text start="880.61" dur="5.61">a sad missile test now remember when</text>
  <text start="883.64" dur="4.71">they do these tests they know the</text>
  <text start="886.22" dur="4.17">missile they know the trajectory they</text>
  <text start="888.35" dur="4.59">know everything about it and they</text>
  <text start="890.39" dur="5.85">basically pre plan the whole thing so it</text>
  <text start="892.94" dur="5.73">can intercept that missile and this is</text>
  <text start="896.24" dur="3.99">what they&amp;#39;ve done before and we can see</text>
  <text start="898.67" dur="4.169">that yes they&amp;#39;re applauding saying it</text>
  <text start="900.23" dur="6.39">works perfectly but again it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="902.839" dur="6.211">working against a true enemy where their</text>
  <text start="906.62" dur="5.7">missiles bob-and-weave they dive they</text>
  <text start="909.05" dur="6.12">move and it&amp;#39;s not an exact trajectory</text>
  <text start="912.32" dur="4.199">now if we&amp;#39;re using it against North</text>
  <text start="915.17" dur="4.47">Korea it might be a little bit easier</text>
  <text start="916.519" dur="5.851">but against China against Russia well</text>
  <text start="919.64" dur="4.949">it&amp;#39;s not going to work that well now</text>
  <text start="922.37" dur="4.11">yesterday we reported on how Russia was</text>
  <text start="924.589" dur="5.761">saying yeah this missile that North</text>
  <text start="926.48" dur="6.06">Korea launched well it is not an ICBM</text>
  <text start="930.35" dur="3.66">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all</text>
  <text start="932.54" dur="3.51">this and it&amp;#39;s funny how the corporate</text>
  <text start="934.01" dur="6.269">media is not reporting on this the South</text>
  <text start="936.05" dur="8.99">Korean intelligence agency their service</text>
  <text start="940.279" dur="7.411">has reported that North Korea does not</text>
  <text start="945.04" dur="4.87">appear to have the technology to build</text>
  <text start="947.69" dur="3.93">an intercontinental ballistic missile</text>
  <text start="949.91" dur="5.04">they don&amp;#39;t even have the testing</text>
  <text start="951.62" dur="6.529">facilities the missile that was launched</text>
  <text start="954.95" dur="6.24">was a modified version of an</text>
  <text start="958.149" dur="6.88">intermediate-range missile that North</text>
  <text start="961.19" dur="8.25">Korea tested pretty much what Russia has</text>
  <text start="965.029" dur="6.12">said now the United States is still out</text>
  <text start="969.44" dur="3.839">there saying it was a ballistic missile</text>
  <text start="971.149" dur="5.791">I can hit Alaska it can hit anything in</text>
  <text start="973.279" dur="7.56">the world know it they&amp;#39;re lying once</text>
  <text start="976.94" dur="7.29">again they&amp;#39;re using this information to</text>
  <text start="980.839" dur="6.24">try to push their agenda the deep state</text>
  <text start="984.23" dur="4.919">they want a war they want to go into</text>
  <text start="987.079" dur="3.491">North Korea because they know what would</text>
  <text start="989.149" dur="3.911">happen if they went into North</text>
  <text start="990.57" dur="4.77">Korea they know that this would turn out</text>
  <text start="993.06" dur="3.51">to be a full-scale war because we know</text>
  <text start="995.34" dur="2.94">that China is there we know that</text>
  <text start="996.57" dur="5.91">Russia&amp;#39;s there and it would be a</text>
  <text start="998.28" dur="5.55">complete disaster in that area now China</text>
  <text start="1002.48" dur="3">is saying that they&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="1003.83" dur="4.77">taking responsibility for North Korea</text>
  <text start="1005.48" dur="4.83">they want other nations to join in and</text>
  <text start="1008.6" dur="3.57">this looks like the signal saying listen</text>
  <text start="1010.31" dur="3.51">we just don&amp;#39;t want Russia which is</text>
  <text start="1012.17" dur="5.67">joining in right now we want other</text>
  <text start="1013.82" dur="7.22">nations to be on board with our template</text>
  <text start="1017.84" dur="5.82">that we&amp;#39;re putting forth our plan and</text>
  <text start="1021.04" dur="4.169">this is why China is out there saying</text>
  <text start="1023.66" dur="4.14">that they&amp;#39;re not going to be the sole</text>
  <text start="1025.209" dur="5.711">country that&amp;#39;s responsible for all of</text>
  <text start="1027.8" dur="6.029">this we see that Tillerson and guitar</text>
  <text start="1030.92" dur="5.039">well they got together and they sign an</text>
  <text start="1033.829" dur="5.221">agreement to step up efforts to fight</text>
  <text start="1035.959" dur="5.041">terrorism and once again we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="1039.05" dur="5.58">see what this really means because right</text>
  <text start="1041" dur="7.17">now it doesn&amp;#39;t mean mean that much we</text>
  <text start="1044.63" dur="6.9">see out in Syria we see that the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1048.17" dur="7.55">army has arrested to us back mercenaries</text>
  <text start="1051.53" dur="7.23">in Syria&amp;#39;s Badia region and these</text>
  <text start="1055.72" dur="4.18">us-backed mercenaries they belong to the</text>
  <text start="1058.76" dur="5.13">Free Syrian Army</text>
  <text start="1059.9" dur="5.67">they are mercenaries they were there to</text>
  <text start="1063.89" dur="4.83">basically create a buffer zone between</text>
  <text start="1065.57" dur="5.79">the Syrian pro-government forces and the</text>
  <text start="1068.72" dur="5.94">Iraqi border and we need to understand</text>
  <text start="1071.36" dur="6.36">that these are not Syrians these are</text>
  <text start="1074.66" dur="6.81">paid mercenaries where the intelligence</text>
  <text start="1077.72" dur="7.62">agencies and the US government they use</text>
  <text start="1081.47" dur="8.4">and they pay for these soldiers to go</text>
  <text start="1085.34" dur="7.77">into Syria and to fight for the United</text>
  <text start="1089.87" dur="5.64">States as a proxy army that&amp;#39;s all this</text>
  <text start="1093.11" dur="6.21">is we&amp;#39;re seeing that the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1095.51" dur="7.11">has confirmed that Baghdady has been</text>
  <text start="1099.32" dur="5.31">killed and we&amp;#39;ve had reports like this</text>
  <text start="1102.62" dur="3.99">before where they were saying that he</text>
  <text start="1104.63" dur="4.68">was dead I think what this really means</text>
  <text start="1106.61" dur="5.07">right now since the it&amp;#39;s coming from the</text>
  <text start="1109.31" dur="5.31">paid mercenaries from the US</text>
  <text start="1111.68" dur="5.7">intelligence agencies is that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1114.62" dur="5.97">reassigned Baghdady he&amp;#39;s no longer with</text>
  <text start="1117.38" dur="6.33">the Islamic state he&amp;#39;s going into hiding</text>
  <text start="1120.59" dur="3.87">he&amp;#39;ll be basically shipped off to</text>
  <text start="1123.71" dur="4.29">someplace</text>
  <text start="1124.46" dur="6.33">and you&amp;#39;ll never see him again we see</text>
  <text start="1128" dur="8.1">something very interesting that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1130.79" dur="10.47">sarin gas which is unaccounted for at a</text>
  <text start="1136.1" dur="9.63">US Army&amp;#39;s Dugway proving ground now this</text>
  <text start="1141.26" dur="6.66">report that came out in 2017 entitled</text>
  <text start="1145.73" dur="5.46">the army needs to improve controls over</text>
  <text start="1147.92" dur="6.3">chemical surety materials included</text>
  <text start="1151.19" dur="7.65">specifics on the alarming recent case</text>
  <text start="1154.22" dur="6.6">which involves missing sarin the amount</text>
  <text start="1158.84" dur="5.13">is enough to cause death within minutes</text>
  <text start="1160.82" dur="8.07">according to the CDC now this is very</text>
  <text start="1163.97" dur="7.68">interesting because out in Syria we</text>
  <text start="1168.89" dur="5.34">always hear Oh sarin gas was used Oh</text>
  <text start="1171.65" dur="5.43">sarin gas was used and we know because</text>
  <text start="1174.23" dur="6.84">the United States the UN Russia Syria</text>
  <text start="1177.08" dur="7.02">all signed off that Syria has no sarin</text>
  <text start="1181.07" dur="4.71">gas now to create these false Flags they</text>
  <text start="1184.1" dur="3.3">wouldn&amp;#39;t need a lot of it they just need</text>
  <text start="1185.78" dur="5.01">a little bit to show that there&amp;#39;s traces</text>
  <text start="1187.4" dur="5.34">of sarin gas and maybe this is what</text>
  <text start="1190.79" dur="5.18">they&amp;#39;ve been using all along because</text>
  <text start="1192.74" dur="5.88">they can&amp;#39;t account for where this sarin</text>
  <text start="1195.97" dur="6.13">material is they don&amp;#39;t know where it is</text>
  <text start="1198.62" dur="8.1">they don&amp;#39;t know where it went to so once</text>
  <text start="1202.1" dur="7.58">again there is a problem here and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1206.72" dur="6.36">seeing these strange anomalies and</text>
  <text start="1209.68" dur="5.17">there&amp;#39;s really no explanation and what</text>
  <text start="1213.08" dur="6.06">is happening at this point is that</text>
  <text start="1214.85" dur="6.84">everything is coming down around these</text>
