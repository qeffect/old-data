  <text start="57.2" dur="4.92">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.67" dur="6.15">episode 1399 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="62.12" dur="4.77">October 12th 2017 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="64.82" dur="5.28">episode is the economic downturn is</text>
  <text start="66.89" dur="5.43">accelerating let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="70.1" dur="4.56">collapse financial news now we are</text>
  <text start="72.32" dur="4.59">getting so many different mixed messages</text>
  <text start="74.66" dur="4.319">on the crypto market from the central</text>
  <text start="76.91" dur="4.17">bankers and we know that the central</text>
  <text start="78.979" dur="2.611">bankers their main objective is to take</text>
  <text start="81.08" dur="2.52">control</text>
  <text start="81.59" dur="3.779">we know that UBS and many of the other</text>
  <text start="83.6" dur="3.629">banks they&amp;#39;re working together to create</text>
  <text start="85.369" dur="3.661">a cryptocurrency the central bank is out</text>
  <text start="87.229" dur="4.411">there saying listen it is a good idea</text>
  <text start="89.03" dur="4.949">but we need to control the crypto market</text>
  <text start="91.64" dur="3.869">we&amp;#39;ll keep it stable and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="93.979" dur="4.021">to push that agenda now on the other</text>
  <text start="95.509" dur="4.86">side there are others who probably are</text>
  <text start="98" dur="4.71">losing a lot of money from the trades</text>
  <text start="100.369" dur="4.291">where they don&amp;#39;t like the crypto market</text>
  <text start="102.71" dur="4.59">and they&amp;#39;re trying to you know push</text>
  <text start="104.66" dur="4.41">people away or drive the prices down so</text>
  <text start="107.3" dur="3.739">they can get into the crypto market I</text>
  <text start="109.07" dur="6.06">mean one of those individuals was Jay</text>
  <text start="111.039" dur="7.36">CEO Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase where</text>
  <text start="115.13" dur="5.969">he lashed out at the crypto market</text>
  <text start="118.399" dur="6.211">calling a complete fraud worse than</text>
  <text start="121.099" dur="5.25">tulip bulbs so we see right now that</text>
  <text start="124.61" dur="4.64">we&amp;#39;re getting messages from all over the</text>
  <text start="126.349" dur="6">place but if we fast forward to today</text>
  <text start="129.25" dur="5.44">Jamie Dimon he won&amp;#39;t even talk about the</text>
  <text start="132.349" dur="4.351">crypto market and what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="134.69" dur="3.93">lately is the crypto market this is an</text>
  <text start="136.7" dur="6.08">open and free market it&amp;#39;s decentralized</text>
  <text start="138.62" dur="7.14">as of right now and we can see that yes</text>
  <text start="142.78" dur="5.23">Bitcoin and many of the other crypto</text>
  <text start="145.76" dur="4.11">currencies they are volatile they move</text>
  <text start="148.01" dur="4.83">up and down but this is what a free and</text>
  <text start="149.87" dur="5.76">open market does it doesn&amp;#39;t just keep</text>
  <text start="152.84" dur="4.229">moving in one direction because if</text>
  <text start="155.63" dur="3.719">something is just moving in one</text>
  <text start="157.069" dur="6.091">direction most likely it&amp;#39;s manipulated</text>
  <text start="159.349" dur="5.431">and it&amp;#39;s being set up to be a bubble now</text>
  <text start="163.16" dur="4.38">there is a lot of individuals out there</text>
  <text start="164.78" dur="4.65">that have no idea what bitcoin is they</text>
  <text start="167.54" dur="3.69">might have heard about it they might</text>
  <text start="169.43" dur="3.21">have heard it in passing they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="171.23" dur="3.33">really dealing with it so when people</text>
  <text start="172.64" dur="4.319">say this is in a bubble it really isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="174.56" dur="5.67">and I do believe that as we move forward</text>
  <text start="176.959" dur="5.971">the crypto market will play a role in</text>
  <text start="180.23" dur="4.739">the currency market in the future now</text>
  <text start="182.93" dur="4.29">the only question is who is going to</text>
  <text start="184.969" dur="5.161">control it now we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="187.22" dur="5.46">the economy and we see that there are</text>
  <text start="190.13" dur="3.72">many many pieces to the economy and many</text>
  <text start="192.68" dur="4.74">of the pieces are starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="193.85" dur="6">we see out in Canada Sears as we know</text>
  <text start="197.42" dur="6.21">they are in a whole lot of trouble and</text>
  <text start="199.85" dur="6.48">the whole entire retail market for them</text>
  <text start="203.63" dur="4.65">is completely imploding and it looks</text>
  <text start="206.33" dur="4.26">like Sears Canada they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="208.28" dur="6.81">liquidating about a hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="210.59" dur="8.7">stores that&amp;#39;s about 12,000 jobs now</text>
  <text start="215.09" dur="7.59">Canada adds around 12,000 jobs each</text>
  <text start="219.29" dur="6.93">month now let&amp;#39;s think about this for a</text>
  <text start="222.68" dur="5.94">second here there&amp;#39;s gonna be 12,000 jobs</text>
  <text start="226.22" dur="3.54">that will be lost that means there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="228.62" dur="4.74">gonna be a lot of part-time full-time</text>
  <text start="229.76" dur="5.34">people looking for work plus all those</text>
  <text start="233.36" dur="4.2">stores all that commercial real estate</text>
  <text start="235.1" dur="5.19">becomes available right now it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="237.56" dur="5.7">to be vacant and we know that Canada</text>
  <text start="240.29" dur="5.19">adds around 12,000 people a month now</text>
  <text start="243.26" dur="3.84">this is going to be a huge problem of</text>
  <text start="245.48" dur="3.06">course they&amp;#39;ll manipulate the numbers</text>
  <text start="247.1" dur="2.85">somehow to make it look like</text>
  <text start="248.54" dur="3.84">everything&amp;#39;s fine they&amp;#39;ll spread it over</text>
  <text start="249.95" dur="4.289">time this is what the US does and a lot</text>
  <text start="252.38" dur="2.91">of countries do copy this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="254.239" dur="3.571">gonna make it look like it&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="255.29" dur="5.22">better than it really is</text>
  <text start="257.81" dur="4.68">but we can see just from this this is</text>
  <text start="260.51" dur="4.98">not the only store we have Toys R Us we</text>
  <text start="262.49" dur="5.31">have Gymboree we have many many other</text>
  <text start="265.49" dur="5.28">stores that are in a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="267.8" dur="4.86">trouble and as we move forward there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="270.77" dur="5.54">going to be a lot more stores they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="272.66" dur="6.24">going to be added to the bankrupt stores</text>
  <text start="276.31" dur="4.24">now we know the automobile industry</text>
  <text start="278.9" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re in a heap of trouble</text>
  <text start="280.55" dur="4.71">GM is going to be laying off about 1,500</text>
  <text start="283.22" dur="4.86">more workers because right now as we</text>
  <text start="285.26" dur="4.11">know car sales are plunging now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="288.08" dur="3.51">trying to do whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="289.37" dur="3.15">to get people to purchase cars and this</text>
  <text start="291.59" dur="2.61">is why they&amp;#39;ve been going to the</text>
  <text start="292.52" dur="3.84">subprime people to the sub problem Prime</text>
  <text start="294.2" dur="2.91">people no money down and remember when</text>
  <text start="296.36" dur="2.46">you buy a car</text>
  <text start="297.11" dur="4.29">you&amp;#39;re really not using your own money</text>
  <text start="298.82" dur="4.62">you&amp;#39;re just borrowing this money now as</text>
  <text start="301.4" dur="4.29">we can see they are cutting production</text>
  <text start="303.44" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re going to be laying off people a</text>
  <text start="305.69" dur="4.14">lot of people think this is just</text>
  <text start="307.04" dur="5.67">temporary but as we&amp;#39;re getting word from</text>
  <text start="309.83" dur="4.589">GM this is not going to be temporary</text>
  <text start="312.71" dur="3.959">because what they&amp;#39;re saying is that</text>
  <text start="314.419" dur="4.321">sales are not that great we might be</text>
  <text start="316.669" dur="4.081">bringing back a you know a lot fewer</text>
  <text start="318.74" dur="4.77">people but we&amp;#39;re going to cut produc</text>
  <text start="320.75" dur="6.03">and we know what happens as time goes on</text>
  <text start="323.51" dur="6.09">all of a sudden they will end up closing</text>
  <text start="326.78" dur="6.99">the plant because they just can&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="329.6" dur="6.11">the sales now we can see by all these</text>
  <text start="333.77" dur="5.16">different indicators that the economy is</text>
  <text start="335.71" dur="6.49">accelerating to the downside JPMorgan</text>
  <text start="338.93" dur="6.57">Chase their net credit card charge offs</text>
  <text start="342.2" dur="7.38">remained over 1 billion as of September</text>
  <text start="345.5" dur="6.96">30th and to be precise this is the</text>
  <text start="349.58" dur="5.19">highest level going back to March 2013</text>
  <text start="352.46" dur="4.35">and we&amp;#39;ve seen this before</text>
  <text start="354.77" dur="5.91">it looks like we&amp;#39;re ticking up once</text>
  <text start="356.81" dur="7.17">again back to well back to the 2010-2011</text>
  <text start="360.68" dur="5.67">area where the charge offs were very</text>
  <text start="363.98" dur="6.12">very high and this is just another sign</text>
  <text start="366.35" dur="6.59">that we are in a heap of trouble credit</text>
  <text start="370.1" dur="7.92">card losses in JPMorgan Chase went from</text>
  <text start="372.94" dur="8.44">1.3 billion up to 1.5 billion so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="378.02" dur="5.91">in trouble here and this is just another</text>
  <text start="381.38" dur="5.31">indicator that we have a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="383.93" dur="5.55">problems now we talk a lot about real</text>
  <text start="386.69" dur="4.8">estate and we talked about how how the</text>
  <text start="389.48" dur="3.9">real estate market is not doing well and</text>
  <text start="391.49" dur="3.81">the National Association of Realtors</text>
  <text start="393.38" dur="4.77">pulled around 2000 Millennials between</text>
  <text start="395.3" dur="7.35">the ages of 22 and 35 about student debt</text>
  <text start="398.15" dur="8.04">and home ownership only 20% of those</text>
  <text start="402.65" dur="6.63">certified surveyed owned a home of the 8</text>
  <text start="406.19" dur="6.9">in 10 that didn&amp;#39;t own a home 83% of them</text>
  <text start="409.28" dur="5.94">said student debt was the reason 84%</text>
  <text start="413.09" dur="4.53">said they have to delay a home purchases</text>
  <text start="415.22" dur="5.61">for years because they&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="417.62" dur="7.77">making the money and they have too much</text>
  <text start="420.83" dur="8.37">student loan debt now that is absolutely</text>
  <text start="425.39" dur="7.2">awful and we could see the the housing</text>
  <text start="429.2" dur="4.95">market is really getting hit but we know</text>
  <text start="432.59" dur="3.329">and we talked about this before there</text>
  <text start="434.15" dur="3.69">was a home builder called Lenore and</text>
  <text start="435.919" dur="3.781">they announced that they would pay a big</text>
  <text start="437.84" dur="4.41">chunk of the student loan for any borrow</text>
  <text start="439.7" dur="4.65">buying a home that means they are</text>
  <text start="442.25" dur="5.07">desperate at this time because they</text>
  <text start="444.35" dur="6.03">cannot find people to purchase homes now</text>
  <text start="447.32" dur="6.48">we need to think about something debt</text>
  <text start="450.38" dur="4.18">has become such a keystone of our</text>
  <text start="453.8" dur="3.58">society</text>
  <text start="454.56" dur="6.03">the only way we can afford something is</text>
  <text start="457.38" dur="6.48">to swap one type of debt that you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="460.59" dur="5.79">afford with another type of debt now</text>
  <text start="463.86" dur="5.52">those people who are just coming out of</text>
  <text start="466.38" dur="5.16">college or you know they have a job or</text>
  <text start="469.38" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;ve lost their job you know when I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="471.54" dur="4.56">talking about it is very difficult to go</text>
  <text start="474.12" dur="5.31">out and purchase a home purchase a car</text>
  <text start="476.1" dur="7.44">with cash and a lot of times when you go</text>
  <text start="479.43" dur="8.1">to the store using credit so there was a</text>
  <text start="483.54" dur="7.56">study by Pew Charitable Trusts show that</text>
  <text start="487.53" dur="5.88">41% of US households have less than 2000</text>
  <text start="491.1" dur="4.77">and savings a full one-third have zero</text>
  <text start="493.41" dur="3.87">savings including one in ten families</text>
  <text start="495.87" dur="3.81">with over a hundred thousand in income</text>
  <text start="497.28" dur="4.109">another study showed that 70 percent of</text>
  <text start="499.68" dur="6.02">Americans had less than four thousand in</text>
  <text start="501.389" dur="7.831">savings the point is America is broke a</text>
  <text start="505.7" dur="6.579">single surprise expense like a flat tire</text>
  <text start="509.22" dur="6.509">or a doctor visit could wipe out most of</text>
  <text start="512.279" dur="5.671">these individuals and people who are</text>
  <text start="515.729" dur="4.881">continually buying homes cars TVs</text>
  <text start="517.95" dur="7.05">college education all they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="520.61" dur="7">adding to their already existing debt</text>
  <text start="525" dur="4.67">and they just keep on taking on more</text>
  <text start="527.61" dur="5.37">debt they&amp;#39;re not making any more money</text>
  <text start="529.67" dur="4.96">they have higher payments and this is</text>
  <text start="532.98" dur="4.89">the way the central bankers like to have</text>
  <text start="534.63" dur="7.35">it they like you to be in debt this is</text>
  <text start="537.87" dur="8.07">their whole entire plan this is what</text>
  <text start="541.98" dur="5.55">they do their product is debt and they</text>
  <text start="545.94" dur="4.14">want people to take out more debt they</text>
  <text start="547.53" dur="5.58">don&amp;#39;t want people to have savings they</text>
  <text start="550.08" dur="5.009">don&amp;#39;t want people to use cash they want</text>
  <text start="553.11" dur="2.729">people to use debt this is where they</text>
  <text start="555.089" dur="3.87">make their money</text>
  <text start="555.839" dur="6.661">this is where they get their control now</text>
  <text start="558.959" dur="5.88">there is an inflation storm coming now</text>
  <text start="562.5" dur="3.78">we talked about this before when we look</text>
  <text start="564.839" dur="2.761">at the US dollar the US dollar has lost</text>
  <text start="566.28" dur="3.45">her mind eighty-four percent of its</text>
  <text start="567.6" dur="5.13">purchasing power since 1971</text>
  <text start="569.73" dur="5.13">and yet the Fed has claimed that</text>
  <text start="572.73" dur="5.4">inflation has been subdued or under</text>
  <text start="574.86" dur="6.75">control throughout that time period well</text>
  <text start="578.13" dur="5.91">it hasn&amp;#39;t because what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="581.61" dur="4.77">is as the value of the dollar decreases</text>
  <text start="584.04" dur="4.35">that means it takes a lot more dollars</text>
  <text start="586.38" dur="6.39">to pay for those products</text>
  <text start="588.39" dur="5.97">and we can see right now that by looking</text>
  <text start="592.77" dur="4.56">at what has been happening since the 70s</text>
  <text start="594.36" dur="7.44">we can see these different indicators</text>
  <text start="597.33" dur="6.84">that show us that inflation has been a</text>
  <text start="601.8" dur="5.97">problem and will be a problem as we move</text>
  <text start="604.17" dur="6.84">forward now with this level of currency</text>
  <text start="607.77" dur="5.34">depreciation incomes would have to rise</text>
  <text start="611.01" dur="4.62">exponentially to compensate for</text>
  <text start="613.11" dur="5.13">Americans high cost of living and they</text>
  <text start="615.63" dur="5.13">haven&amp;#39;t as a result of this Americans</text>
  <text start="618.24" dur="4.86">have an increasingly relied relied on to</text>
  <text start="620.76" dur="4.56">parents working instead of one while</text>
  <text start="623.1" dur="4.29">supplementing their incomes with credit</text>
  <text start="625.32" dur="4.47">cards and other debt instruments and</text>
  <text start="627.39" dur="6.12">this is what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing over time</text>
  <text start="629.79" dur="5.7">and it&amp;#39;s getting worse now people are</text>
  <text start="633.51" dur="3.93">losing their high-paying jobs and</text>
  <text start="635.49" dur="6.05">they&amp;#39;re getting these part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="637.44" dur="7.38">which makes it even worse now put simply</text>
  <text start="641.54" dur="5.71">when we look at all this whatever</text>
  <text start="644.82" dur="5.85">the Fed is throwing out there in regards</text>
  <text start="647.25" dur="7.76">to inflation is pretty much garbage they</text>
  <text start="650.67" dur="7.77">purposely want us to believe that</text>
  <text start="655.01" dur="6.49">inflation doesn&amp;#39;t exist because it</text>
  <text start="658.44" dur="6.45">allows the Fed to overstate GDP growth</text>
  <text start="661.5" dur="5.73">and paper over the fact that incomes</text>
  <text start="664.89" dur="5.51">have been on the decline relative to</text>
  <text start="667.23" dur="7.52">cost of living since the early 70s and</text>
  <text start="670.4" dur="8.17">we can see right now that the economy</text>
  <text start="674.75" dur="5.53">well its accelerating to the downside</text>
  <text start="678.57" dur="3.18">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at all these</text>
