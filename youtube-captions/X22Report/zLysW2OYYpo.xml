  <text start="52.7" dur="5.28">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="56.45" dur="5.34">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="57.98" dur="7.5">episode 1435 a.n today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.79" dur="6.09">November 29th 2017 and the tide of the</text>
  <text start="65.48" dur="4.35">episode is the central banks just</text>
  <text start="67.88" dur="4.86">signaled the collapse is right around</text>
  <text start="69.83" dur="5.399">the corner let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="72.74" dur="4.71">collapse financial news now last month</text>
  <text start="75.229" dur="7.141">the Department of Commerce they came out</text>
  <text start="77.45" dur="7.17">and they were telling the world you know</text>
  <text start="82.37" dur="4.889">this is what Americans are spending</text>
  <text start="84.62" dur="5.76">their money on and in the third quarter</text>
  <text start="87.259" dur="6">the biggest driver of marginal spending</text>
  <text start="90.38" dur="5.31">was on car sales technically if we look</text>
  <text start="93.259" dur="4.081">at it its Motor Vehicles and parts which</text>
  <text start="95.69" dur="3.539">increased by fifteen point six billion</text>
  <text start="97.34" dur="4.74">to four hundred and sixty three point</text>
  <text start="99.229" dur="4.771">five billion now once again that was the</text>
  <text start="102.08" dur="3.98">beginning of the third quarter then we</text>
  <text start="104" dur="5.49">had the hurricanes and of course they</text>
  <text start="106.06" dur="5.11">had to revise these numbers which again</text>
  <text start="109.49" dur="5.129">the hurricane does not hit the entire</text>
  <text start="111.17" dur="6.42">country it hits States and it hits small</text>
  <text start="114.619" dur="4.471">portions of the state and as we can see</text>
  <text start="117.59" dur="4.8">there was a hurricane in Florida that</text>
  <text start="119.09" dur="5.4">was one in Texas and at this point they</text>
  <text start="122.39" dur="3.57">were saying okay let&amp;#39;s revise these</text>
  <text start="124.49" dur="3.42">numbers here we are at the end of the</text>
  <text start="125.96" dur="4.68">third quarter let&amp;#39;s revise them and</text>
  <text start="127.91" dur="5.01">we&amp;#39;re gonna show that well Americans</text>
  <text start="130.64" dur="3.65">really didn&amp;#39;t spend their money on motor</text>
  <text start="132.92" dur="4.2">vehicles they spent their money on</text>
  <text start="134.29" dur="4.93">health insurance now now remember when</text>
  <text start="137.12" dur="7.17">you purchase a car people are not laying</text>
  <text start="139.22" dur="8.43">out 30 40 50 60 thousand dollars there</text>
  <text start="144.29" dur="6.9">they&amp;#39;re borrowing this money they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="147.65" dur="6.809">taking out loans when they purchase</text>
  <text start="151.19" dur="7.2">health care they&amp;#39;re actually spending</text>
  <text start="154.459" dur="7.621">their hard-earned money and it looks</text>
  <text start="158.39" dur="6.209">like health care well it took the lead</text>
  <text start="162.08" dur="7.71">and the reason for this is because</text>
  <text start="164.599" dur="8.211">premiums skyrocketed and remember health</text>
  <text start="169.79" dur="7.02">care which is also known as Obamacare</text>
  <text start="172.81" dur="6.49">well it contributes to GDP and the</text>
  <text start="176.81" dur="4.379">higher the number the better it is and</text>
  <text start="179.3" dur="4.799">we can see that they revised motor</text>
  <text start="181.189" dur="5.221">vehicles it looks like for that time</text>
  <text start="184.099" dur="7.201">period it was about a hundred</text>
  <text start="186.41" dur="11.19">and nine billion healthcare spending was</text>
  <text start="191.3" dur="10.2">around 200 or so billion almost double</text>
  <text start="197.6" dur="6.6">and we see at this point health care has</text>
  <text start="201.5" dur="4.62">been leading the way in what Americans</text>
  <text start="204.2" dur="4.47">are spending their money on they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="206.12" dur="4.74">spending it in retail they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="208.67" dur="4.26">spending it on homes they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="210.86" dur="5.04">spending it they&amp;#39;re spending it on</text>
  <text start="212.93" dur="4.95">health care and this should tell you</text>
  <text start="215.9" dur="4.92">something that we have a major problem</text>
  <text start="217.88" dur="5.46">because again if we strip away health</text>
  <text start="220.82" dur="6.08">care we strip away the manipulation</text>
  <text start="223.34" dur="6.12">what&amp;#39;s left in the GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="226.9" dur="4.09">absolutely nothing now the corporate</text>
  <text start="229.46" dur="3.36">media the government they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="230.99" dur="4.08">telling us that pending home sales jump</text>
  <text start="232.82" dur="4.08">the most in eight months and of course</text>
  <text start="235.07" dur="3.51">this is on the hurricane rebound they</text>
  <text start="236.9" dur="4.26">had a show that Oh see look what</text>
  <text start="238.58" dur="4.89">happened everything is back on track now</text>
  <text start="241.16" dur="4.56">of course these pending home sales</text>
  <text start="243.47" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re manipulated they&amp;#39;re fake and</text>
  <text start="245.72" dur="4.08">you&amp;#39;re trying to tell me throughout the</text>
  <text start="247.73" dur="3.75">summer because remember if we go back a</text>
  <text start="249.8" dur="4.62">couple of months one two three four</text>
  <text start="251.48" dur="5.069">months or so we&amp;#39;ve had declining pending</text>
  <text start="254.42" dur="6.689">home sales and all of a sudden it shoots</text>
  <text start="256.549" dur="6.391">up out of nowhere and once again this</text>
  <text start="261.109" dur="4.471">numbers coming from the south which is</text>
  <text start="262.94" dur="4.29">up by seven point four percent now</text>
  <text start="265.58" dur="3.3">remember they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating the</text>
  <text start="267.23" dur="3.42">housing market making us believe that</text>
  <text start="268.88" dur="4.92">everything is fine they did this back in</text>
  <text start="270.65" dur="5.73">2006 2007 2008 with the subprime</text>
  <text start="273.8" dur="5.1">securities where yes everyone believed</text>
  <text start="276.38" dur="4.92">the housing market was absolutely</text>
  <text start="278.9" dur="5.73">perfect it was going to continue on and</text>
  <text start="281.3" dur="5.34">nothing was going to change except when</text>
  <text start="284.63" dur="3.99">it did and the entire market came</text>
  <text start="286.64" dur="3.39">crashing down and many people were</text>
  <text start="288.62" dur="4.37">underwater many people lost their homes</text>
  <text start="290.03" dur="5.46">many foreclosures many short sales and</text>
  <text start="292.99" dur="5.83">people never really recovered now</text>
  <text start="295.49" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;ve pushed the bubbles in 20</text>
  <text start="298.82" dur="5.43">different cities by manipulating certain</text>
  <text start="301.1" dur="5.31">factors and they drove prices back up</text>
  <text start="304.25" dur="4.05">not for the whole country but certain</text>
  <text start="306.41" dur="3.78">areas to make everyone believe that</text>
  <text start="308.3" dur="4.95">everything is fine but we can see</text>
  <text start="310.19" dur="4.89">already things aren&amp;#39;t fine because we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="313.25" dur="4.38">been looking through all of the</text>
  <text start="315.08" dur="4.05">propaganda and we are seeing the economy</text>
  <text start="317.63" dur="1.97">is deteriorating very very quickly now</text>
  <text start="319.13" dur="3.14">Janet</text>
  <text start="319.6" dur="7.38">Ellen was out there she was testifying</text>
  <text start="322.27" dur="7.2">in front of Congress and once before she</text>
  <text start="326.98" dur="5.31">said that we were not gonna see a crisis</text>
  <text start="329.47" dur="7.08">again in our lifetime like we saw back</text>
  <text start="332.29" dur="6.06">in 2008 now she went a step further and</text>
  <text start="336.55" dur="3.78">of course everyone laughed and said yeah</text>
  <text start="338.35" dur="3.48">that means something&amp;#39;s coming even I</text>
  <text start="340.33" dur="3.39">said this and it does mean that</text>
  <text start="341.83" dur="5.79">something&amp;#39;s coming well she took this a</text>
  <text start="343.72" dur="6.59">step further and she used the c-word and</text>
  <text start="347.62" dur="6.11">what I mean by the c-word is that word</text>
  <text start="350.31" dur="9.19">contained and we know that Ben Bernanke</text>
  <text start="353.73" dur="8.44">used the word contain months before we</text>
  <text start="359.5" dur="5.84">had the recession where he said the</text>
  <text start="362.17" dur="6.54">housing the subprime it&amp;#39;s all contained</text>
  <text start="365.34" dur="5.26">so she was out there she prepared</text>
  <text start="368.71" dur="4.86">remarks ahead of what may be her last</text>
  <text start="370.6" dur="4.77">that parents before Congress and she</text>
  <text start="373.57" dur="3.93">came out saying that the economic</text>
  <text start="375.37" dur="4.59">expansion is increasingly broad-based</text>
  <text start="377.5" dur="4.8">across sectors as well as across much of</text>
  <text start="379.96" dur="3.96">the global economy she expects the Fed</text>
  <text start="382.3" dur="4.1">to continue gradually raising interest</text>
  <text start="383.92" dur="5.61">rates and trimming the balance sheet</text>
  <text start="386.4" dur="5.05">although asset valuations are high by</text>
  <text start="389.53" dur="3.75">historical standards overall</text>
  <text start="391.45" dur="4.56">vulnerabilities in the financial sector</text>
  <text start="393.28" dur="4.89">appear moderate as the banking system is</text>
  <text start="396.01" dur="4.01">well capitalized and broad measures of</text>
  <text start="398.17" dur="5.7">leverage and credit growth remain</text>
  <text start="400.02" dur="7.96">contained and once again she just</text>
  <text start="403.87" dur="7.8">signaled that we are headed into a major</text>
  <text start="407.98" dur="6.27">disaster every time they go down this</text>
  <text start="411.67" dur="5.03">track that there where they convince us</text>
  <text start="414.25" dur="4.92">that we&amp;#39;re not going to see a crisis</text>
  <text start="416.7" dur="7.09">where everything is contained and</text>
  <text start="419.17" dur="7.26">everything is great that means that</text>
  <text start="423.79" dur="5.37">we&amp;#39;re heading into a collapse scenario a</text>
  <text start="426.43" dur="5.34">recession a depression I mean Ben</text>
  <text start="429.16" dur="6.45">Bernanke was out there assuring America</text>
  <text start="431.77" dur="6.36">and the world that we are not going to</text>
  <text start="435.61" dur="5.75">see a recession our forecasting one</text>
  <text start="438.13" dur="7.35">nothing&amp;#39;s on their radar everything is</text>
  <text start="441.36" dur="6.16">contained and in that same exact year in</text>
  <text start="445.48" dur="6.14">the month of October</text>
  <text start="447.52" dur="6.06">guess what they brought the system down</text>
  <text start="451.62" dur="3.579">all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="453.58" dur="4.049">everything crashed of course they blame</text>
  <text start="455.199" dur="6.93">this on everyone else except themselves</text>
  <text start="457.629" dur="7.711">and of course this was created by the</text>
  <text start="462.129" dur="6.57">central bank&amp;#39;s it always is now Russia</text>
  <text start="465.34" dur="4.949">is very worried they understand that</text>
  <text start="468.699" dur="3.72">this system is coming down China</text>
  <text start="470.289" dur="5.43">understands this because they&amp;#39;re set up</text>
  <text start="472.419" dur="6.06">to be the new system and they know what</text>
  <text start="475.719" dur="5.85">the Cabal is capable of because they</text>
  <text start="478.479" dur="6.541">don&amp;#39;t want to you know release their our</text>
  <text start="481.569" dur="6.421">power to someone else and to keep the</text>
  <text start="485.02" dur="7.5">system going what do they need they need</text>
  <text start="487.99" dur="6.66">hard assets and Russia is very worried</text>
  <text start="492.52" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re worried that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="494.65" dur="5.639">come skate gold reserves and right now</text>
  <text start="498.31" dur="5.009">we can see that in a surprising</text>
  <text start="500.289" dur="5.49">unexpected warning Russia&amp;#39;s Finance</text>
  <text start="503.319" dur="5.521">Minister caution Washington yesterday</text>
  <text start="505.779" dur="5.82">that if our gold and our currency revert</text>
  <text start="508.84" dur="5.489">reserves can be arrested being</text>
  <text start="511.599" dur="7.041">confiscated even if such a thought</text>
  <text start="514.329" dur="8.431">exists it would be financial terrorism</text>
  <text start="518.64" dur="6.699">now the question is why did he say this</text>
  <text start="522.76" dur="5.31">well the common appears to have been</text>
  <text start="525.339" dur="5.61">prompted by consideration of escalating</text>
  <text start="528.07" dur="5.94">u.s. EU sanctions which could ultimately</text>
  <text start="530.949" dur="5.941">impact Russia&amp;#39;s offshore held gold and</text>
  <text start="534.01" dur="4.62">reserves if sanctions include the</text>
  <text start="536.89" dur="3.48">freezing of foreign accounts and the</text>
  <text start="538.63" dur="4.34">central bank it would be equal to</text>
  <text start="540.37" dur="5.01">declaring financial war on Russia and</text>
  <text start="542.97" dur="4.989">this is what Russia is worried about</text>
  <text start="545.38" dur="4.47">because we could see that the Cabal is</text>
  <text start="547.959" dur="4.651">going to become very very desperate and</text>
  <text start="549.85" dur="4.83">this is the central bank the Cabal in</text>
  <text start="552.61" dur="6.75">America they&amp;#39;re like intertwined here</text>
  <text start="554.68" dur="7.98">and they would definitely go after hard</text>
  <text start="559.36" dur="5.69">assets like gold to back this is the</text>
  <text start="562.66" dur="4.89">current system that were in today and</text>
  <text start="565.05" dur="5.83">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is other</text>
  <text start="567.55" dur="6.659">countries are warning the other central</text>
  <text start="570.88" dur="6">banks the Cabal do not do this this is</text>
  <text start="574.209" dur="4.911">not going to end well because we have</text>
  <text start="576.88" dur="5.49">factions in the central banking system</text>
  <text start="579.12" dur="5.86">fighting each other but the head Central</text>
  <text start="582.37" dur="4.92">Bank again they&amp;#39;re just sitting back</text>
  <text start="584.98" dur="5.909">there watching the</text>
  <text start="587.29" dur="7.44">they know that the new system is being</text>
  <text start="590.889" dur="6.331">set up and they will be fine and they</text>
  <text start="594.73" dur="5.94">will push their agenda Ford once again</text>
  <text start="597.22" dur="7.41">create paper currency put countries into</text>
  <text start="600.67" dur="7.349">debt have complete control over the</text>
  <text start="604.63" dur="6.87">countries steal the hard assets put</text>
  <text start="608.019" dur="7.62">people into poverty this is what the</text>
  <text start="611.5" dur="7.73">central bankers do their product is debt</text>
  <text start="615.639" dur="6.541">and they put people countries</text>
  <text start="619.23" dur="6.49">corporations into as much debt as</text>
  <text start="622.18" dur="6.06">possible this is how the system is</text>
  <text start="625.72" dur="5.64">designed it&amp;#39;s not supposed to be a</text>
  <text start="628.24" dur="4.589">system of debt it&amp;#39;s supposed to be a</text>
  <text start="631.36" dur="3.659">system of checks and balances is what</text>
  <text start="632.829" dur="4.32">the founding fathers really wanted the</text>
  <text start="635.019" dur="3.771">central bankers they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="637.149" dur="4.11">because they don&amp;#39;t make a profit</text>
  <text start="638.79" dur="5.229">remember their corporation is privately</text>
  <text start="641.259" dur="5.76">held and we could see right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="644.019" dur="5.041">preparing and they just signaled that</text>
  <text start="647.019" dur="4.891">everything is about to end and</text>
  <text start="649.06" dur="4.469">everything is about to shift to</text>

  <text start="657.25" dur="4.56">there&amp;#39;s a reset this one is one of the</text>
  <text start="659.98" dur="4.409">biggest we&amp;#39;ve ever seen it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="661.81" dur="4.019">petrodollar system which was set up back</text>
  <text start="664.389" dur="3.93">in the 70s when we came off the gold</text>
  <text start="665.829" dur="5.611">standard we&amp;#39;ve never seen anything like</text>
  <text start="668.319" dur="5.07">this before this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="671.44" dur="3.81">negative interest rates this is why</text>
  <text start="673.389" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;re seeing stimulus because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="675.25" dur="4.589">doing all of these things because these</text>
  <text start="677.649" dur="5.49">the system that we&amp;#39;re in today never</text>
  <text start="679.839" dur="4.771">existed before like this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="683.139" dur="4.051">trying to keep they&amp;#39;re trying to keep it</text>
  <text start="684.61" dur="4.62">going as best they possibly can because</text>
  <text start="687.19" dur="3.749">they don&amp;#39;t want to be blamed for the</text>
  <text start="689.23" dur="3.479">system to come you know for the system</text>
  <text start="690.939" dur="5.101">to come down because if it does come</text>
  <text start="692.709" dur="5.61">down guess what they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="696.04" dur="4.349">blamed if there&amp;#39;s no event if there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="698.319" dur="5.311">distraction the central bank will be</text>
  <text start="700.389" dur="5.461">blamed for everything and that means</text>
  <text start="703.63" dur="4.05">this will filter all the way back up to</text>
  <text start="705.85" dur="4.65">the main central bank and people will</text>
