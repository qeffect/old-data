  <text start="55.229" dur="3.841">on itself now of course the government</text>
  <text start="57.089" dur="2.82">the talking heads are trying to convince</text>
  <text start="59.07" dur="3.39">everyone there in this incredible</text>
  <text start="59.909" dur="5.251">recovery we already see what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="62.46" dur="6.6">in Greece they&amp;#39;re already making plans</text>
  <text start="65.16" dur="5.94">to confiscate their currency confiscate</text>
  <text start="69.06" dur="5.46">their precious metals confiscate their</text>
  <text start="71.1" dur="5.97">precious stones and this is definitely</text>
  <text start="74.52" dur="6.51">going to spread across Europe into the</text>
  <text start="77.07" dur="7.02">United States Canada Australia you won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="81.03" dur="5.85">be left behind and in Europe right now</text>
  <text start="84.09" dur="5.46">we see that there are many things that</text>
  <text start="86.88" dur="6.51">are occurring where we can see the</text>
  <text start="89.55" dur="8.4">economy is not doing as well as they say</text>
  <text start="93.39" dur="7.589">it is I mean Frances unemployment it has</text>

  <text start="103.829" dur="4.231">average well of course they can explain</text>
  <text start="105.899" dur="5.58">this away it&amp;#39;s all the fault of the</text>
  <text start="108.06" dur="4.83">Paris attacks the European Union already</text>
  <text start="111.479" dur="3.541">came out and said because of the Paris</text>
  <text start="112.89" dur="5.009">attacks this might spread to the rest of</text>
  <text start="115.02" dur="6.32">Europe so they&amp;#39;re already planning to</text>
  <text start="117.899" dur="8.101">blame this on another group or</text>
  <text start="121.34" dur="7.83">eventually another country secondly the</text>
  <text start="126" dur="6.36">service sector purchasing manager index</text>
  <text start="129.17" dur="9.3">was slightly worse than expected in</text>
  <text start="132.36" dur="8.07">November the eurozone retail sales which</text>
  <text start="138.47" dur="6.4">unexpectedly and I love when they use</text>
  <text start="140.43" dur="7.38">that word declined sales decline by 0.1%</text>
  <text start="144.87" dur="8.79">they thought this was going to increase</text>
  <text start="147.81" dur="8.36">by 0.2% so this is the second unexpected</text>
  <text start="153.66" dur="4.77">dip in a row how could this be</text>
  <text start="156.17" dur="5.08">everyone&amp;#39;s employed everyone&amp;#39;s making</text>
  <text start="158.43" dur="5.19">money this makes no sense well it does</text>
  <text start="161.25" dur="2.819">make sense when you manipulate the</text>
  <text start="163.62" dur="4.17">unemploy</text>
  <text start="164.069" dur="6.87">limit numbers and when you spew out the</text>
  <text start="167.79" dur="7.5">illusionary statistics to the world to</text>
  <text start="170.939" dur="7.741">your people the real economic indicators</text>
  <text start="175.29" dur="7.02">are going to show what&amp;#39;s really going on</text>
  <text start="178.68" dur="5.789">and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing not just</text>
  <text start="182.31" dur="6.42">in Europe but here in the United States</text>
  <text start="184.469" dur="6.181">and in the United States we know that</text>
  <text start="188.73" dur="5.159">they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating the initial</text>
  <text start="190.65" dur="6.809">claims and it&amp;#39;s been falling it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="193.889" dur="5.791">back to the 1970 levels and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="197.459" dur="4.59">saying yes we have full employment at</text>
  <text start="199.68" dur="4.289">five percent and most likely by the</text>
  <text start="202.049" dur="6.42">first of next year or probably between</text>
  <text start="203.969" dur="7.05">4.8 and 4.9 nobody&amp;#39;s claiming</text>
  <text start="208.469" dur="7.38">unemployment even know since June there</text>
  <text start="211.019" dur="7.14">has been a million layoffs approaching a</text>
  <text start="215.849" dur="5.28">million layoffs and we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="218.159" dur="9.36">little bit of a tick up in initial</text>
  <text start="221.129" dur="9.42">claims right now it rose 9,000 now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="227.519" dur="6.93">very interesting because challenger gray</text>
  <text start="230.549" dur="8.18">&amp;amp; christmas they have been showing that</text>
  <text start="234.449" dur="8.85">there is continuing continuous layoffs</text>
  <text start="238.729" dur="7.66">since 2014 non-stop and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="243.299" dur="6.381">increasing more and more businesses are</text>
  <text start="246.389" dur="6.93">shutting down sales are declining</text>
  <text start="249.68" dur="5.559">revenue is declining but of course they</text>
  <text start="253.319" dur="6.061">need to keep the illusion alive a little</text>
  <text start="255.239" dur="7.231">bit longer now we know the housing</text>
  <text start="259.38" dur="4.8">market is in a bubble and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="262.47" dur="5.85">seeing right now is housing bubble to</text>
  <text start="264.18" dur="7.079">point out now we know two things about</text>
  <text start="268.32" dur="6.48">the housing bubbles they always pop with</text>
  <text start="271.259" dur="6.15">devastating consequences and the talking</text>
  <text start="274.8" dur="5.28">pundants out there always deny that</text>
  <text start="277.409" dur="5.161">we&amp;#39;re in any type of bubble and this is</text>
  <text start="280.08" dur="5.76">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now now there is</text>
  <text start="282.57" dur="5.399">a chart that not only identifies the</text>
  <text start="285.84" dur="5.609">housing bubbles but explains why they</text>
  <text start="287.969" dur="5.76">are inevitable and why they it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="291.449" dur="5.911">to pop and is going to have a complete</text>
  <text start="293.729" dur="6.78">collapse of the housing market</text>
  <text start="297.36" dur="7.26">this chart reveals the tight correlation</text>
  <text start="300.509" dur="6.87">between real adjusted for inflation new</text>
  <text start="304.62" dur="6.299">house sale prices and real wages</text>
  <text start="307.379" dur="6.78">salaries every time a house price gets</text>
  <text start="310.919" dur="6.601">ahead of earnings house prices declined</text>
  <text start="314.159" dur="5.401">sharply since these are real price wages</text>
  <text start="317.52" dur="4.109">they go down when prices wages don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="319.56" dur="4.8">keep up with the inflation so while</text>
  <text start="321.629" dur="5.521">normal house prices didn&amp;#39;t snag much in</text>
  <text start="324.36" dur="4.5">the late 1960s as inflation took off</text>
  <text start="327.15" dur="4.44">they fell sharply when adjusted for</text>
  <text start="328.86" dur="5.399">inflation house prices fell again in the</text>
  <text start="331.59" dur="4.949">late 70s and when they briefly exceeded</text>
  <text start="334.259" dur="4.741">the growth of earnings an unexpected</text>
  <text start="336.539" dur="5.461">period of housing prices soared above</text>
  <text start="339" dur="5.58">earnings in the late 80s and it was</text>
  <text start="342" dur="6.629">followed by a slump in housing in the</text>
  <text start="344.58" dur="7.019">90s housing bubble one is clearly</text>
  <text start="348.629" dur="6.301">visible as house prices skyrocketed far</text>
  <text start="351.599" dur="5.82">above earnings between 2004 and 2008 and</text>
  <text start="354.93" dur="7.859">what do we have after 2008 that&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="357.419" dur="8.631">a complete collapse now the gap between</text>
  <text start="362.789" dur="9.12">real house prices and real earnings is</text>
  <text start="366.05" dur="9.13">even wider than it was during 2008 hmm</text>
  <text start="371.909" dur="7.081">that&amp;#39;s very interesting so this tells us</text>
  <text start="375.18" dur="8.19">that housing prices are going to fall</text>
  <text start="378.99" dur="7.019">sharply once again and guess what the</text>
  <text start="383.37" dur="7.319">entire housing market is going to</text>
  <text start="386.009" dur="8.28">readjust and collapse this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="390.689" dur="6.84">going to happen it&amp;#39;s inevitable there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.289" dur="6.511">no way out of this of course there could</text>
  <text start="397.529" dur="4.711">be some type of an event but this we are</text>
  <text start="400.8" dur="3.959">headed right there we&amp;#39;re already seeing</text>
  <text start="402.24" dur="5.099">the housing prices come down now is this</text>
  <text start="404.759" dur="7.231">happening in every single area at the</text>
  <text start="407.339" dur="7.14">same exact time no but what it does have</text>
  <text start="411.99" dur="5.01">what what does happen is it spreads from</text>
  <text start="414.479" dur="5.011">one city to the next city and it takes</text>
  <text start="417" dur="5.219">its time and it sneaks up on you and</text>
  <text start="419.49" dur="4.919">then all of a sudden everyone says what</text>
  <text start="422.219" dur="4.74">just happened this is what happened to</text>
  <text start="424.409" dur="4.05">first go around all those speculators</text>
  <text start="426.959" dur="3.831">that were out there flipping their</text>
  <text start="428.459" dur="4.131">houses it snuck up</text>
  <text start="430.79" dur="4.56">on them and they were stuck with</text>
  <text start="432.59" dur="4.95">multiple houses and they could not sell</text>
  <text start="435.35" dur="3.99">them and it&amp;#39;s not just houses its</text>
  <text start="437.54" dur="5.37">apartment buildings condos and things</text>
  <text start="439.34" dur="7.52">like that and we are seeing the same</text>
  <text start="442.91" dur="10.23">thing occur but this time the gap</text>
  <text start="446.86" dur="12.94">between real wages and earnings and home</text>
  <text start="453.14" dur="8.82">prices is wider that it was in 2008 that</text>
  <text start="459.8" dur="7.29">means the collapse it&amp;#39;s going to be much</text>
  <text start="461.96" dur="9.87">much worse now we understand</text>
  <text start="467.09" dur="7.74">manufacturing is a complete disaster and</text>
  <text start="471.83" dur="5.88">it is getting worse it&amp;#39;s abundantly</text>
  <text start="474.83" dur="5.88">clear that were in a recession at this</text>
  <text start="477.71" dur="4.92">point if you want to go by the numbers</text>
  <text start="480.71" dur="3.3">from the government the numbers from</text>
  <text start="482.63" dur="3.6">what they&amp;#39;re putting out here but if you</text>
  <text start="484.01" dur="4.23">look past that we&amp;#39;re past the recession</text>
  <text start="486.23" dur="5.01">right now we are in a collapsed</text>
  <text start="488.24" dur="7.11">situation the year your change which is</text>
  <text start="491.24" dur="5.4">which is shown here on the x 12 report</text>
  <text start="495.35" dur="2.58">com site you can see the graph there</text>
  <text start="496.64" dur="4.56">you&amp;#39;re on YouTube you can see the graph</text>
  <text start="497.93" dur="5.13">there it shows that factory orders have</text>
  <text start="501.2" dur="5.39">now been negative over the prior year</text>
  <text start="503.06" dur="7.76">for a whopping 12 consecutive months</text>
  <text start="506.59" dur="6.52">which is just shy of the 15 months of</text>
  <text start="510.82" dur="5.05">the year to year declines recording</text>
  <text start="513.11" dur="7.7">during the Great Recession so this shows</text>
  <text start="515.87" dur="8.13">us that we right now are in a collapse</text>
  <text start="520.81" dur="6.61">situation us factory workers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="524" dur="7.47">back to where they were in the late in</text>
  <text start="527.42" dur="8.27">late 2010 and we know what happened in</text>
  <text start="531.47" dur="6.72">2008 2009 2010 in-system imploded and</text>
  <text start="535.69" dur="5.98">the central bank came in and started</text>
  <text start="538.19" dur="5.52">pumping it up this time there is nothing</text>
  <text start="541.67" dur="3.69">to pump up they have been pumping it up</text>
  <text start="543.71" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re going to try to pump it up more</text>
  <text start="545.36" dur="5.88">but it&amp;#39;s not going to work it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="548.15" dur="5.73">completely implode on itself now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="551.24" dur="5.22">another indicator right now that shows</text>
  <text start="553.88" dur="5.28">that there is something wrong in the</text>
  <text start="556.46" dur="4.95">economy besides all the other things</text>
  <text start="559.16" dur="5.01">that we spoke about from all the prior</text>
  <text start="561.41" dur="9.27">reports another sector</text>
  <text start="564.17" dur="11.27">now has hit a point where it&amp;#39;s declining</text>
  <text start="570.68" dur="7.529">rapidly and this is Stu signaling a</text>
  <text start="575.44" dur="8.47">domestic and global collapse in trade</text>
  <text start="578.209" dur="8.19">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the</text>
  <text start="583.91" dur="6.45">trucker&amp;#39;s especially the heaviest class</text>
  <text start="586.399" dur="8.731">8 trucks with a gross weight over 33,000</text>
  <text start="590.36" dur="7.02">pounds it&amp;#39;s not looking good because</text>
  <text start="595.13" dur="5.94">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the class</text>
  <text start="597.38" dur="5.88">528 orders they have decreased by forty</text>
  <text start="601.07" dur="4.769">percent year-on-year and twenty six</text>
  <text start="603.26" dur="5.25">percent from October the year-to-year</text>
  <text start="605.839" dur="7.591">decline was the eighth consecutive month</text>
  <text start="608.51" dur="7.5">of class 528 contraction so right now</text>
  <text start="613.43" dur="4.409">the Class eight orders of sixteen</text>
  <text start="616.01" dur="4.319">thousand six hundred were below our</text>
  <text start="617.839" dur="3.93">channel check based between twenty two</text>
  <text start="620.329" dur="4.021">thousand and twenty five thousand that</text>
  <text start="621.769" dur="8.611">were expected a drop of fifty-nine</text>
  <text start="624.35" dur="7.679">percent this tells us that people are</text>
  <text start="630.38" dur="4.819">not shipping things all over the place</text>
  <text start="632.029" dur="6.12">so if we look at this we see</text>
  <text start="635.199" dur="7.091">manufacturing is down the Baltic Dry</text>
  <text start="638.149" dur="8.101">Index is at a very very low point retail</text>
  <text start="642.29" dur="5.76">sales are basically having a very</text>
  <text start="646.25" dur="3.18">difficult time right now during this</text>
  <text start="648.05" dur="4.44">holiday season because trucking right</text>
  <text start="649.43" dur="6.33">now should be incredible but we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="652.49" dur="5.219">seeing that we&amp;#39;re seeing everything the</text>
  <text start="655.76" dur="4.019">opposite of what the government and the</text>
  <text start="657.709" dur="3.75">central bankers are telling us because</text>
  <text start="659.779" dur="3.541">they&amp;#39;re telling us that we&amp;#39;re close to</text>
  <text start="661.459" dur="3.601">full employment that the economy is</text>
  <text start="663.32" dur="3.03">recovering everything&amp;#39;s fine in the</text>
  <text start="665.06" dur="3.56">housing market everything&amp;#39;s fine in the</text>
  <text start="666.35" dur="5.489">retail market but we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="668.62" dur="7.06">manufacturing down the shipment of raw</text>
  <text start="671.839" dur="7.74">material down trucking is down retail</text>
  <text start="675.68" dur="6.599">sales are down stores are looking to</text>
  <text start="679.579" dur="6.99">close before the holidays the holiday</text>
  <text start="682.279" dur="6.831">season is has even ended and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="686.569" dur="4.741">getting many more critical indicators</text>
  <text start="689.11" dur="5.62">screaming that there&amp;#39;s a global economic</text>
  <text start="691.31" dur="5.6">crisis which is basically getting deeper</text>
  <text start="694.73" dur="2.18">and deeper</text>
  <text start="697.139" dur="4.5">and we&amp;#39;re seeing that right now if we</text>
  <text start="699.42" dur="5.099">look at these indicators that the price</text>
  <text start="701.639" dur="5">of oil is below forty dollars a barrel</text>
  <text start="704.519" dur="6.211">we saw this back in two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="706.639" dur="5.8">before the stock market collapsed the</text>
  <text start="710.73" dur="3.959">Business Roundtable forecast for</text>

  <text start="722.639" dur="4.26">that we&amp;#39;ve seen since the last recession</text>
  <text start="725.1" dur="4.339">this is a huge problem because corporate</text>
