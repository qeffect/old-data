  <text start="91.72" dur="5.61">multiple phases and we know that phase</text>
  <text start="94.959" dur="7.711">one they&amp;#39;re going to have to do</text>
  <text start="97.33" dur="7.709">something to scare governments not just</text>

  <text start="121.27" dur="7.739">was coming up well this time we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="125.59" dur="7.43">know exactly what it is but we know that</text>
  <text start="129.009" dur="7.921">when they do this type of suppression</text>
  <text start="133.02" dur="7.45">something occurs and we know the central</text>
  <text start="136.93" dur="6.51">bank&amp;#39;s they need more control to keep</text>
  <text start="140.47" dur="6.03">the system alive because what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="143.44" dur="4.92">doing right now it&amp;#39;s not working the</text>
  <text start="146.5" dur="4.379">economy is deteriorating very very</text>
  <text start="148.36" dur="4.23">quickly and we look out at the eurozone</text>
  <text start="150.879" dur="3.841">we see the economic growth in the</text>
  <text start="152.59" dur="5.82">nineteen country eurozone well it has</text>
  <text start="154.72" dur="5.61">completely lost momentum we see markets</text>
  <text start="158.41" dur="5.52">purchasing managers index for the</text>
  <text start="160.33" dur="8.42">eurozone well it is dropped 252</text>
  <text start="163.93" dur="8.25">16 from 52.9 this is a 20 month low and</text>
  <text start="168.75" dur="7.329">if it goes below 50 were in contraction</text>
  <text start="172.18" dur="7.08">and were headed to that point we see a</text>
  <text start="176.079" dur="6.24">DP came out with their employment</text>
  <text start="179.26" dur="6.349">numbers and it looks like the US economy</text>
  <text start="182.319" dur="6.691">only added 100 54,000 jobs in September</text>
  <text start="185.609" dur="5.921">missing their expectations of 165,000</text>
  <text start="189.01" dur="5.19">and remember a lot of these numbers are</text>
  <text start="191.53" dur="4.909">manipulated they can&amp;#39;t even fudge the</text>
  <text start="194.2" dur="5.489">manipulated numbers that well anymore</text>
  <text start="196.439" dur="6.19">this is the weakest print since April</text>
  <text start="199.689" dur="8.311">but when we look at manufacturing it is</text>
  <text start="202.629" dur="9.81">down by six thousand jobs absolutely</text>
  <text start="208" dur="8.04">awful when we look at adp services</text>
  <text start="212.439" dur="5.371">they&amp;#39;re telling us that jobs are piling</text>
  <text start="216.04" dur="4.169">up people are getting into retail people</text>
  <text start="217.81" dur="4.009">who are going into the food business but</text>
  <text start="220.209" dur="5.46">we see the restaurant performance index</text>
  <text start="221.819" dur="5.381">dropping to all-time lows and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="225.669" dur="5.49">telling us that people are getting jobs</text>
  <text start="227.2" dur="5.879">in this area someone&amp;#39;s lying here and we</text>
  <text start="231.159" dur="3.57">can see right now from the amount of</text>
  <text start="233.079" dur="3.391">restaurants that are closing that are</text>
  <text start="234.729" dur="5.311">declaring bankruptcy stores that are</text>
  <text start="236.47" dur="7.979">closing we&amp;#39;re seeing it&amp;#39;s contracting</text>
  <text start="240.04" dur="7.71">not expanding and we see right now</text>
  <text start="244.449" dur="6.391">they&amp;#39;re making excuses of why these</text>
  <text start="247.75" dur="7.88">numbers are the way they are they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="250.84" dur="7.679">saying that job growth has slowed in</text>
  <text start="255.63" dur="7.719">recent months because we&amp;#39;re approaching</text>
  <text start="258.519" dur="7.051">full employment which is absolutely</text>
  <text start="263.349" dur="6.091">ridiculous because these employment</text>
  <text start="265.57" dur="6.33">numbers are completely fake phony and</text>
  <text start="269.44" dur="5.759">false they&amp;#39;re manipulated they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="271.9" dur="5.4">even real but they have to give some</text>
  <text start="275.199" dur="4.891">type of an excuse that&amp;#39;s why they give</text>
  <text start="277.3" dur="5.04">excuses like it&amp;#39;s speculators this is</text>
  <text start="280.09" dur="4.169">why they tell you that we&amp;#39;re near full</text>
  <text start="282.34" dur="3.75">employment this is why they tell you</text>
  <text start="284.259" dur="4.201">well the employment numbers really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="286.09" dur="3.93">tell the whole story retail really</text>
  <text start="288.46" dur="3.569">doesn&amp;#39;t tell the whole story we&amp;#39;re not a</text>
  <text start="290.02" dur="3.75">manufacturing country anymore we&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="292.029" dur="3.871">service country we&amp;#39;re no longer a</text>
  <text start="293.77" dur="3.9">service country we&amp;#39;re a paper-pushing</text>
  <text start="295.9" dur="3.48">country I mean they come</text>
  <text start="297.67" dur="4.41">up with so many different excuses it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="299.38" dur="5.19">getting ridiculous already so right now</text>
  <text start="302.08" dur="7.53">we see I have some services it just</text>
  <text start="304.57" dur="7.92">surged out of nowhere and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="309.61" dur="7.83">strange about this is that business</text>
  <text start="312.49" dur="6.93">optimism about the year ahead is at one</text>
  <text start="317.44" dur="6.39">of the lowest level since the global</text>
  <text start="319.42" dur="9.27">financial crisis now we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="323.83" dur="7.8">before where the is M services all of a</text>
  <text start="328.69" dur="6.2">sudden surged up and you know what</text>
  <text start="331.63" dur="7.74">happened right after that we had the</text>
  <text start="334.89" dur="8.77">2008-2009 Great Recession we are at the</text>
  <text start="339.37" dur="6.89">same point right now and market is out</text>
  <text start="343.66" dur="5.67">there even with the latest increase</text>
  <text start="346.26" dur="4.66">they&amp;#39;re saying that the economy is still</text>
  <text start="349.33" dur="4.68">growing at an annualized rate of only</text>
  <text start="350.92" dur="6.87">one percent they continually revised gdp</text>
  <text start="354.01" dur="7.53">lower and lower and lower and then we</text>
  <text start="357.79" dur="7.05">have factory orders they have been</text>
  <text start="361.54" dur="6.48">declining for 22 straight months in a</text>
  <text start="364.84" dur="7.26">row the longest non recessionary streak</text>
  <text start="368.02" dur="7.17">in US history remember the government is</text>
  <text start="372.1" dur="4.74">not going to call a recession they</text>
  <text start="375.19" dur="5.73">usually don&amp;#39;t do it until months after</text>
  <text start="376.84" dur="5.88">the recession we are in a recession</text>
  <text start="380.92" dur="4.02">right now when we look at all these</text>
  <text start="382.72" dur="6.36">economic indicators they are showing</text>
  <text start="384.94" dur="5.76">that we are in a recession heading</text>
  <text start="389.08" dur="4.34">towards a depression because a lot of</text>
  <text start="390.7" dur="5.4">these indicators are worse than</text>
  <text start="393.42" dur="7.21">2008-2009 when we were in the Great</text>
  <text start="396.1" dur="7.65">Recession so something&amp;#39;s wrong and the</text>
  <text start="400.63" dur="7.89">government as we know it loves to lie to</text>
  <text start="403.75" dur="6.95">the people right now the world is in a</text>
  <text start="408.52" dur="5.49">hundred and fifty two trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="410.7" dur="5.98">worth of debt this is a record-breaking</text>
  <text start="414.01" dur="5.13">level of debt this is more than two</text>
  <text start="416.68" dur="4.83">times the size of the global economy</text>
  <text start="419.14" dur="6.12">member the central bankers that&amp;#39;s their</text>
  <text start="421.51" dur="6.03">business debt they love debt and we can</text>
  <text start="425.26" dur="4.5">see right now they want to push more</text>
  <text start="427.54" dur="3.69">debt because if they don&amp;#39;t their system</text>
  <text start="429.76" dur="3.12">comes crashing down</text>
  <text start="431.23" dur="6.15">and this is why they&amp;#39;re always trying to</text>
  <text start="432.88" dur="7.28">push debt now we see gold and silver</text>
  <text start="437.38" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;ve been suppressed and we know that</text>
  <text start="440.16" dur="6.31">central banks the banking system we know</text>
  <text start="443.26" dur="6.78">that they manipulate the gold and silver</text>
  <text start="446.47" dur="6.87">markets and back in april when deutsche</text>
  <text start="450.04" dur="4.89">bank agreed to settle that the july 2014</text>
  <text start="453.34" dur="4.47">lawsuit alleging precious metals</text>
  <text start="454.93" dur="6.26">manipulation by a group of banks like</text>
  <text start="457.81" dur="7.68">Deutsche Bank Bank of Nova Nova Scotia</text>
  <text start="461.19" dur="6.61">HSBC UBS they were all accused of</text>
  <text start="465.49" dur="5.52">manipulating prices in the multi-billion</text>
  <text start="467.8" dur="4.77">dollar market now the lawsuit was</text>
  <text start="471.01" dur="4.38">originally filed in New York District</text>
  <text start="472.57" dur="6.03">Court by litigator Jay Scott Nicholson</text>
  <text start="475.39" dur="7.29">resident of Washington DC he alleged</text>
  <text start="478.6" dur="6.96">that the banks which were overseeing the</text>
  <text start="482.68" dur="5.64">century-old silver fix manipulated the</text>
  <text start="485.56" dur="7.25">physical and comics futures market since</text>
  <text start="488.32" dur="6.69">January of 20 of 2007 the lawsuit</text>
  <text start="492.81" dur="5.98">subsequently received a class-action</text>
  <text start="495.01" dur="7.44">status it was the first case to target</text>
  <text start="498.79" dur="5.4">the silver fix now six months ago not</text>
  <text start="502.45" dur="4.44">only had the lawsuit against precious</text>
  <text start="504.19" dur="5.97">metals manipulation not been swept away</text>
  <text start="506.89" dur="5.49">but the lead defendant German bank</text>
  <text start="510.16" dur="5.43">deutsche bank agreed to settle the</text>
  <text start="512.38" dur="8.67">litigation over allegations it conspired</text>
  <text start="515.59" dur="7.53">with Bank of Nova Scotia HSBC to fix the</text>
  <text start="521.05" dur="4.07">silver prices now terms of the</text>
  <text start="523.12" dur="5.16">settlement of course we&amp;#39;re not disclosed</text>
  <text start="525.12" dur="7.03">but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now US</text>
  <text start="528.28" dur="7.65">District Judge Valerie caproni well she</text>
  <text start="532.15" dur="6.15">ruled that investors are now allowed to</text>
  <text start="535.93" dur="5.79">pursue antitrust and manipulation claims</text>
  <text start="538.3" dur="5.97">against the bank of nova scotia hsbc</text>
  <text start="541.72" dur="6.69">holding clearing the way for a silver</text>
  <text start="544.27" dur="6.93">manipulation price-fixing litigation so</text>
  <text start="548.41" dur="6.36">we can see right now yes indeed the</text>
  <text start="551.2" dur="6.12">banks do manipulate the precious metals</text>
  <text start="554.77" dur="4.61">market and it goes further than that it</text>
  <text start="557.32" dur="5.91">goes all the way up to the central banks</text>
  <text start="559.38" dur="5.1">because every time we see the gold and</text>
  <text start="563.23" dur="3.979">silver</text>
  <text start="564.48" dur="5.099">prices suppress all of a sudden we see</text>
  <text start="567.209" dur="7.461">thousands upon thousands upon thousands</text>
  <text start="569.579" dur="8.851">of contracts thrown at it all at once</text>
  <text start="574.67" dur="4.96">now we know the central bankers as many</text>
  <text start="578.43" dur="4.769">would say they&amp;#39;re running out of</text>
  <text start="579.63" dur="6.81">ammunition so what do they need to do</text>
  <text start="583.199" dur="4.711">they need to change the rules and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="586.44" dur="3.93">been talking about this we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="587.91" dur="5.64">talking about phase 1 of this collapse</text>
  <text start="590.37" dur="5.94">and the IMF came out with their latest</text>
  <text start="593.55" dur="4.229">report on financial stability and warned</text>
  <text start="596.31" dur="5.01">that the risks to financial stability</text>
  <text start="597.779" dur="5.881">are growing a warned about what it calls</text>
  <text start="601.32" dur="5.25">medium turn dangers in both emerging and</text>
  <text start="603.66" dur="5.13">developed economies and they express</text>
  <text start="606.57" dur="7.879">concerns about Europe which we know</text>
  <text start="608.79" dur="9.68">Europe is completely falling apart so as</text>
  <text start="614.449" dur="6.281">this system continually deteriorates it</text>
  <text start="618.47" dur="4.57">would leave about a quarter of a banks</text>
  <text start="620.73" dur="4.979">in developed countries too weak to</text>
  <text start="623.04" dur="5.72">support further growth and they would be</text>
  <text start="625.709" dur="5.37">very susceptible to future shocks</text>
  <text start="628.76" dur="5.74">because these banks are controlling</text>
  <text start="631.079" dur="9.901">about 12 trillion of assets and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="634.5" dur="9.839">vulnerable right now so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="640.98" dur="6.63">seeing is the central banks are looking</text>
  <text start="644.339" dur="5.73">for ways to help the banking system not</text>
  <text start="647.61" dur="3.9">the people the banking system we have to</text>
  <text start="650.069" dur="3.871">understand that over twenty-five percent</text>
  <text start="651.51" dur="4.71">of banks in advanced economies and they</text>
  <text start="653.94" dur="4.92">have about eleven point seven trillion</text>
  <text start="656.22" dur="4.38">in assets well there they would remain</text>
  <text start="658.86" dur="7.669">weak and face significant structural</text>
  <text start="660.6" dur="10.59">challenges if something should happen so</text>
  <text start="666.529" dur="8.831">what is the IMF suggesting well they</text>
  <text start="671.19" dur="7.56">want to change the rules hmm how do they</text>
  <text start="675.36" dur="6.289">change the rules well they need</text>
  <text start="678.75" dur="8.61">governments they need their help they</text>
  <text start="681.649" dur="8.261">need to change rules of the banking</text>
  <text start="687.36" dur="7.56">system they need legal changes they need</text>
  <text start="689.91" dur="6.46">legislation and what they want to do the</text>
  <text start="694.92" dur="5.77">central bankers</text>
  <text start="696.37" dur="9">they want a way to make it easier for</text>
  <text start="700.69" dur="7.71">banks to get rid of their bad loans so</text>
  <text start="705.37" dur="7.74">for instance if there was a bank in</text>
  <text start="708.4" dur="6.93">Europe and they have a loss of about 80</text>
  <text start="713.11" dur="6.18">billion euros and they&amp;#39;re able to just</text>
  <text start="715.33" dur="5.55">get rid of some of the bad loans they</text>
  <text start="719.29" dur="7.049">might be able to change their whole</text>
  <text start="720.88" dur="8.52">banking status around and maybe gain 60</text>
  <text start="726.339" dur="6.181">billion euros they&amp;#39;re saying Italian</text>
  <text start="729.4" dur="4.379">banks Greek banks they would be one of</text>
  <text start="732.52" dur="4.44">the biggest beneficiaries of such</text>
  <text start="733.779" dur="8.161">changes and this would allow all</text>
  <text start="736.96" dur="8.73">European banks to do this and it would</text>
  <text start="741.94" dur="6.99">boost the bank&amp;#39;s profitability where</text>
  <text start="745.69" dur="5.79">would these bad loans go we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="748.93" dur="3.9">right now but this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="751.48" dur="3.45">trying to do you see it&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="752.83" dur="5.52">starting so how are they going to</text>
  <text start="754.93" dur="5.7">convince governments that this is the</text>
  <text start="758.35" dur="5.48">right thing to do because you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="760.63" dur="6.87">not going to start stop in Europe bank</text>
  <text start="763.83" dur="6.52">Japan is going to do this we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="767.5" dur="5.04">see the u.s. do this Canada&amp;#39;s gonna do</text>
  <text start="770.35" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s going to spread and all the central</text>
  <text start="772.54" dur="7.86">banks are going to say yes we need this</text>
  <text start="775.99" dur="6.93">ability but the question is when they</text>
  <text start="780.4" dur="5.96">place this legislation into the</text>
  <text start="782.92" dur="6.24">government&amp;#39;s how do they get it passed</text>
  <text start="786.36" dur="6.58">because you know they&amp;#39;re not just going</text>
  <text start="789.16" dur="6.09">to do it maybe they will but the people</text>
  <text start="792.94" dur="4.29">are going to be very angry with this</text>
  <text start="795.25" dur="6.029">because then everyone should be able to</text>
  <text start="797.23" dur="9.81">get rid of their bad loans or their bad</text>
  <text start="801.279" dur="9.421">debt so most likely they are already</text>
  <text start="807.04" dur="6.33">preparing for the first phase of the</text>

  <text start="813.37" dur="7.5">legislation to allow the central banks</text>
  <text start="816.88" dur="5.49">to do more and they&amp;#39;ve already started</text>
  <text start="820.87" dur="3.03">the process now what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="822.37" dur="3.75">is they&amp;#39;re going to introduce this</text>
  <text start="823.9" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re going to see what the</text>
  <text start="826.12" dur="3.659">government&amp;#39;s are willing to do and if</text>
  <text start="828.43" dur="6.06">they cannot get this</text>
  <text start="829.779" dur="8.281">on their own we will see an event and a</text>
  <text start="834.49" dur="7.409">most likely a financial event to scare</text>
  <text start="838.06" dur="6.389">governments into doing this and maybe</text>
  <text start="841.899" dur="3.841">even doing more because we know this is</text>
  <text start="844.449" dur="5.161">not the only thing they want to change</text>
  <text start="845.74" dur="5.969">they want to change a lot more and what</text>
  <text start="849.61" dur="5.729">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the beginning</text>

  <text start="855.339" dur="6.48">the collapse is not that far off because</text>
  <text start="860.17" dur="5.539">when the central bankers don&amp;#39;t get their</text>

  <text start="865.709" dur="9.161">well guess what they&amp;#39;re going to put the</text>
  <text start="869.41" dur="8.31">fear of a collapsing society into the</text>
