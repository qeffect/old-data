  <text start="191.519" dur="6.571">rap sheet and she is using this in</text>
  <text start="194.01" dur="5.94">projecting this on Trump it&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="198.09" dur="6.03">talking about here is she&amp;#39;s panicking</text>
  <text start="199.95" dur="8.159">and she&amp;#39;s nervous and afraid this is why</text>
  <text start="204.12" dur="6.149">the deep state is going after Kellyanne</text>
  <text start="208.109" dur="5.931">Conway for instance this is why this</text>

  <text start="233.519" dur="7.711">exiting nothing and supposedly she saved</text>
  <text start="237.69" dur="5.699">the dress from that period of time and</text>
  <text start="241.23" dur="4.92">they said okay if you have the dress let</text>
  <text start="243.389" dur="4.291">us analyze it and let&amp;#39;s pick up some of</text>
  <text start="246.15" dur="3.36">the DNA that&amp;#39;s on there and let&amp;#39;s see if</text>

  <text start="623.43" dur="7.2">and this entire case should be dismissed</text>
  <text start="627.6" dur="8.78">so she went down the rabbit hole she</text>
  <text start="630.63" dur="8.36">went directly to spying now Powell</text>

  <text start="666.27" dur="5.37">attorney tried the entrapment route</text>
  <text start="669" dur="4.89">it failed a trap Minh is a practice</text>
