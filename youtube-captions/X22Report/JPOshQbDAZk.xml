  <text start="39.199" dur="6">tember second 2016 and totally episode</text>
  <text start="42.62" dur="6.99">is central banks are now practicing</text>
  <text start="45.199" dur="7.051">backdoor monetization let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="49.61" dur="6.42">economic collapse financial news now we</text>
  <text start="52.25" dur="6.96">realize that the IMF the World Bank the</text>
  <text start="56.03" dur="6.449">central banks around the world they are</text>
  <text start="59.21" dur="4.5">not working for the people they are</text>
  <text start="62.479" dur="3.14">working for themselves we have to</text>
  <text start="63.71" dur="4.019">remember their product is dead and we</text>
  <text start="65.619" dur="4.271">understand that the IMF continually</text>
  <text start="67.729" dur="5">comes out with their prediction and how</text>
  <text start="69.89" dur="6.24">the global economy is going to be doing</text>
  <text start="72.729" dur="6.551">but something very interesting that we</text>
  <text start="76.13" dur="8.45">should note is that the IMF is never</text>
  <text start="79.28" dur="8.87">right because the IMF continually</text>
  <text start="84.58" dur="6.789">downgrades its global growth forecasts</text>
  <text start="88.15" dur="6.13">each year now the beginning of each year</text>
  <text start="91.369" dur="5.221">they come out with a forecast and they</text>
  <text start="94.28" dur="4.98">never increase it they usually downgrade</text>
  <text start="96.59" dur="4.74">it because they&amp;#39;re overestimating what</text>
  <text start="99.26" dur="4.17">the world economy is doing to get people</text>
  <text start="101.33" dur="4.86">hope to make it seem like they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="103.43" dur="6.27">a wonderful job but we already know in</text>
  <text start="106.19" dur="7.83">the beginning that the economies are</text>
  <text start="109.7" dur="8.64">failing now the IMF&amp;#39;s world economic</text>
  <text start="114.02" dur="6.83">outlook it&amp;#39;s due early October and it is</text>
  <text start="118.34" dur="7.86">expected to signal the sixth consecutive</text>
  <text start="120.85" dur="7.269">downward revision in 18 months now here</text>
  <text start="126.2" dur="3.36">we are once again where they continually</text>
  <text start="128.119" dur="3.9">tell us in the beginning of each year</text>
  <text start="129.56" dur="3.569">that things are going to be fine and of</text>
  <text start="132.019" dur="3.541">course they&amp;#39;re going to tell us you know</text>
  <text start="133.129" dur="4.021">in the year of 2017 in the year 2018</text>
  <text start="135.56" dur="3.45">we&amp;#39;re going to see you know four or five</text>
  <text start="137.15" dur="4.02">percent gdp it&amp;#39;s going to be incredible</text>
  <text start="139.01" dur="5.64">and then we get to those years and what</text>
  <text start="141.17" dur="6.51">happens they have to downgrade them and</text>
  <text start="144.65" dur="6.96">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing this quite often we</text>
  <text start="147.68" dur="6.75">also see that the IMF is not going to</text>
  <text start="151.61" dur="5.64">participate in the Greek bailout now</text>
  <text start="154.43" dur="4.919">that there&amp;#39;s a problem in Greece we know</text>
  <text start="157.25" dur="5.61">there&amp;#39;s a huge effort in privatization</text>
  <text start="159.349" dur="4.441">we know the banks are buying up their</text>
  <text start="162.86" dur="2.599">natural</text>
  <text start="163.79" dur="4.47">resources for pennies on the dollar</text>
  <text start="165.459" dur="4.721">they&amp;#39;re implementing austerity on the</text>
  <text start="168.26" dur="4.77">people they&amp;#39;re doing everything the</text>
  <text start="170.18" dur="6.24">central bank wants the problem is there</text>
  <text start="173.03" dur="6.36">is too much debt and what happens if</text>
  <text start="176.42" dur="5.099">there&amp;#39;s too much debt and the country</text>
  <text start="179.39" dur="4.409">cannot pay back the country collapses</text>
  <text start="181.519" dur="4.89">well the central bankers really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="183.799" dur="6.181">want that it doesn&amp;#39;t help them in that</text>
  <text start="186.409" dur="5.22">way they want to keep the country</text>
  <text start="189.98" dur="3.509">hanging on it&amp;#39;s almost like a drug</text>
  <text start="191.629" dur="4.95">addict you don&amp;#39;t want them to die</text>
  <text start="193.489" dur="5.97">because there go your sales of the drug</text>
  <text start="196.579" dur="5.22">you want him to hang on so you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="199.459" dur="6.36">want to give them too much you wanted</text>
  <text start="201.799" dur="7.741">them just enough to ask for some more so</text>
  <text start="205.819" dur="6.57">right now Greece has too much debt the</text>
  <text start="209.54" dur="6.69">IMF realizes this and what they want to</text>
  <text start="212.389" dur="7.261">do is remove some of the debt so they</text>
  <text start="216.23" dur="4.53">can give them some more and this is what</text>
  <text start="219.65" dur="3.979">they wanted from the beginning because</text>
  <text start="220.76" dur="5.28">they realize that many of the countries</text>
  <text start="223.629" dur="5.5">they have too much debt and if they</text>
  <text start="226.04" dur="4.71">don&amp;#39;t do something countries will start</text>
  <text start="229.129" dur="4.5">to collapse on their own and they cannot</text>
  <text start="230.75" dur="4.889">have this happen and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="233.629" dur="4.311">economies around the world they are</text>
  <text start="235.639" dur="4.651">getting worse and worse as time goes on</text>
  <text start="237.94" dur="5.049">caterpillar as we know their sales are</text>
  <text start="240.29" dur="4.529">absolutely awful they&amp;#39;re worse than the</text>
  <text start="242.989" dur="5.071">Great Recession they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="244.819" dur="4.98">laying off 2,000 workers in Belgium here</text>
  <text start="248.06" dur="5.13">in the United States they&amp;#39;ve come out</text>
  <text start="249.799" dur="5.58">with the unemployment numbers and the</text>
  <text start="253.19" dur="4.229">BLS reported that in the month of August</text>
  <text start="255.379" dur="4.561">there were about a hundred and fifty one</text>
  <text start="257.419" dur="3.6">thousand jobs that were added now they</text>
  <text start="259.94" dur="4.74">thought it was going to be at about a</text>
  <text start="261.019" dur="6.511">hundred and eighty thousand so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="264.68" dur="5.489">missing about 30,000 jobs from their</text>
  <text start="267.53" dur="4.59">expectations and we know a lot of these</text>
  <text start="270.169" dur="4.801">jobs I would say the majority of them</text>
  <text start="272.12" dur="4.56">they are part-time jobs so the</text>
  <text start="274.97" dur="3">unemployment rate remained at four point</text>
  <text start="276.68" dur="3.479">nine percent they expected it to come</text>
  <text start="277.97" dur="4.919">down to four point eight percent so I</text>
  <text start="280.159" dur="5.301">can see already the next month we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="282.889" dur="6.15">most likely going to see a huge drop in</text>
  <text start="285.46" dur="5.44">unemployment to help the elections to</text>
  <text start="289.039" dur="4.231">convince everyone that the economy is</text>
  <text start="290.9" dur="4.59">doing very very well the labor force</text>
  <text start="293.27" dur="4.59">participation rate well that remained</text>
  <text start="295.49" dur="5.22">flat at sixty two point eight percent</text>
  <text start="297.86" dur="9.029">and a number of people not in the labor</text>
  <text start="300.71" dur="9.84">force increased by 58,000 people now if</text>
  <text start="306.889" dur="8.25">you really look at this the US labor</text>
  <text start="310.55" dur="8.88">market stalled by nearly fifty percent</text>
  <text start="315.139" dur="8.131">and when we look at the jobs we see the</text>
  <text start="319.43" dur="9.199">jobs went to minimum wage food service</text>
  <text start="323.27" dur="8.25">and drink places leisure hospitality and</text>
  <text start="328.629" dur="5.621">we see right now that there were 34</text>
  <text start="331.52" dur="4.949">thousand jobs that were added to these</text>
  <text start="334.25" dur="5.879">industries even though we have evidence</text>
  <text start="336.469" dur="7.07">of increasing layoffs by restaurants</text>
  <text start="340.129" dur="6.54">across the country education and health</text>
  <text start="343.539" dur="8.4">well they added around 39,000 jobs and</text>
  <text start="346.669" dur="10.261">the high-paying jobs they declined</text>
  <text start="351.939" dur="7.181">manufacturing construction mining we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="356.93" dur="6.09">lost fourteen thousand six thousand and</text>
  <text start="359.12" dur="6.99">four thousand jobs we&amp;#39;ve seen we see a</text>
  <text start="363.02" dur="7.799">steep drop in temporary jobs they have</text>
  <text start="366.11" dur="7.919">declined by three thousand in August so</text>
  <text start="370.819" dur="6.78">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now since 2014</text>
  <text start="374.029" dur="5.1">the US has added five hundred and twenty</text>
  <text start="377.599" dur="5.22">three thousand waiters and bartenders</text>
  <text start="379.129" dur="8.731">and we have lost 13,000 manufacturing</text>
  <text start="382.819" dur="8.82">jobs again we have a problem we have a</text>
  <text start="387.86" dur="5.66">huge problem and the situation is</text>
  <text start="391.639" dur="4.56">getting worse and worse as time goes on</text>
  <text start="393.52" dur="5.56">we see the National Association of</text>
  <text start="396.199" dur="6.96">credit managers economist Chris Kuehl</text>
  <text start="399.08" dur="7.32">said overall it was fun while it lasted</text>
  <text start="403.159" dur="6.391">the trends had been up and now they are</text>
  <text start="406.4" dur="5.669">not the best that can be said about the</text>
  <text start="409.55" dur="5.869">decline is that it was bad and hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="412.069" dur="6.27">got much worse the sales collapse is</text>
  <text start="415.419" dur="4.99">consistent with what has been appearing</text>
  <text start="418.339" dur="4.771">and the purchasing managers index and</text>
  <text start="420.409" dur="6.06">other statistics so it is unlikely to be</text>
  <text start="423.11" dur="6.69">an anomaly not good timing as far as the</text>
  <text start="426.469" dur="5.161">retail community is concerned and when</text>
  <text start="429.8" dur="4.91">we look at this what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="431.63" dur="6.06">is that small businesses are being hit</text>
  <text start="434.71" dur="7.96">we see small businesses are defaulting</text>
  <text start="437.69" dur="8.21">now according to pay net borrowing by</text>
  <text start="442.67" dur="6.72">the US Small Businesses sank in July</text>
  <text start="445.9" dur="8.37">firms are late at repaying existing</text>
  <text start="449.39" dur="9.54">loans and trends are pointing down and</text>
  <text start="454.27" dur="8.38">we&amp;#39;re not seeing economic growth headed</text>
  <text start="458.93" dur="6.96">our way at all companies are struggling</text>
  <text start="462.65" dur="8.04">right now to pay existing debts loans</text>
  <text start="465.89" dur="7.26">more than 30 days rose in July by 1.6 3%</text>
  <text start="470.69" dur="4.74">the fourth straight monthly increase and</text>
  <text start="473.15" dur="5.91">the highest delinquency rate since</text>
  <text start="475.43" dur="6.44">december of 2012 so when we look at this</text>
  <text start="479.06" dur="6.36">we have to say to ourselves let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="481.87" dur="5.29">unemployment is declining it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="485.42" dur="3.51">not going anywhere even the manipulated</text>
  <text start="487.16" dur="6.66">unemployment they can&amp;#39;t make it look</text>
  <text start="488.93" dur="6.09">good small businesses retail they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="493.82" dur="3.63">having trouble paying back their loans</text>
  <text start="495.02" dur="5.01">sales aren&amp;#39;t there caterpillar shows us</text>
  <text start="497.45" dur="5.67">that it&amp;#39;s having a very difficult time</text>
  <text start="500.03" dur="7.83">they have declining sales that are worse</text>
  <text start="503.12" dur="8.13">than the Great Recession in 2008 when we</text>
  <text start="507.86" dur="8.4">look at manufacturing we see things are</text>
  <text start="511.25" dur="8.88">rapidly falling apart New York is M well</text>
  <text start="516.26" dur="6.92">that has crashed back to contraction we</text>
  <text start="520.13" dur="6.57">had July where we had this surge from 54</text>
  <text start="523.18" dur="7.08">45.4 to 60 point seven well it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="526.7" dur="5.72">entirely erased purchases revenues</text>
  <text start="530.26" dur="5.74">expected future demand they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="532.42" dur="6.37">tumbling and then we look at us factory</text>
  <text start="536" dur="6.06">orders they have declined year over a</text>
  <text start="538.79" dur="6.93">year every month since October of 2014</text>
  <text start="542.06" dur="7.8">this is the longest period in US history</text>
  <text start="545.72" dur="8">since nineteen fifty-six that we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="549.86" dur="6.72">this and it has always always always</text>
  <text start="553.72" dur="8.44">indicated the US economy is in a</text>
  <text start="556.58" dur="7.2">recession US Capitol good shipments they</text>
  <text start="562.16" dur="3.24">have collapsed to nine point four</text>
  <text start="563.78" dur="5.43">percent year-on-year</text>
  <text start="565.4" dur="8.79">I mean it just gets worse and worse as</text>
  <text start="569.21" dur="7.02">time goes on and the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="574.19" dur="5.34">government&amp;#39;s that are intertwined with</text>
  <text start="576.23" dur="6.27">the central banks they realize they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="579.53" dur="8.61">running out of ammunition how can we</text>
  <text start="582.5" dur="9.02">keep this system propped up well one way</text>
  <text start="588.14" dur="7.31">they&amp;#39;re doing this is this secret</text>
  <text start="591.52" dur="10.06">backdoor monetization of its own</text>
  <text start="595.45" dur="8.92">securities the ECB&amp;#39;s QE program well it</text>
  <text start="601.58" dur="5.61">is implemented through several national</text>
  <text start="604.37" dur="7.53">central banks like Germany&amp;#39;s Bundesbank</text>
  <text start="607.19" dur="7.23">and Spain&amp;#39;s banco de espana national</text>
  <text start="611.9" dur="7.29">central banks by bonds according to</text>
  <text start="614.42" dur="7.14">rules set by the ECB the problem is that</text>
  <text start="619.19" dur="5.58">these constraints narrow the stock of</text>
  <text start="621.56" dur="5.07">debt the banks can buy from these rules</text>
  <text start="624.77" dur="5.25">prevent the purchase of too much debt</text>
  <text start="626.63" dur="5.01">from any one country and stop the</text>
  <text start="630.02" dur="5.07">central banks from buying debt with</text>
  <text start="631.64" dur="6.3">steeply negative yields so here&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="635.09" dur="4.95">example Germans Bundesbank bought two</text>
  <text start="637.94" dur="4.38">hundred nine billion euro and sovereign</text>
  <text start="640.04" dur="6.44">bonds between March and July it also</text>
  <text start="642.32" dur="6.81">sold off 43 billion euros of this debt</text>
  <text start="646.48" dur="4.87">those securities are then back on the</text>
  <text start="649.13" dur="3.57">market to be bought potentially helping</text>
  <text start="651.35" dur="5.01">the central banks to work around the</text>
  <text start="652.7" dur="7.71">program&amp;#39;s restrictions this suggests</text>
  <text start="656.36" dur="5.7">that one of the ways that the QE has</text>
  <text start="660.41" dur="3.69">been implemented especially in the</text>
  <text start="662.06" dur="5.3">countries where scarcity may be an issue</text>
  <text start="664.1" dur="8.18">is that the national central bank is</text>
  <text start="667.36" dur="10.27">essentially buying bonds from itself or</text>
  <text start="672.28" dur="9.52">perhaps even from other national central</text>
  <text start="677.63" dur="10.08">banks in the Euro system so they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="681.8" dur="9.66">passing them back and forth it&amp;#39;s amazing</text>
  <text start="687.71" dur="6.54">what they&amp;#39;re doing to manipulate the</text>
  <text start="691.46" dur="5.37">system to make everyone believe that</text>
  <text start="694.25" dur="4.32">this is okay and we know the Bank of</text>
  <text start="696.83" dur="3.57">Japan they had a</text>
  <text start="698.57" dur="4.65">take this a step further they had to</text>
  <text start="700.4" dur="4.8">start buying stocks where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="703.22" dur="6.81">looking to nationalize the stock market</text>
  <text start="705.2" dur="6.99">well the ECB right now they might be</text>
  <text start="710.03" dur="4.17">doing the same thing as the Bank of</text>
  <text start="712.19" dur="5.37">Japan where they&amp;#39;re going to buy</text>
  <text start="714.2" dur="8.79">equities as part of their expanded</text>
  <text start="717.56" dur="9.65">stimulus program so we have the central</text>
  <text start="722.99" dur="6.6">bank doing everything in the economy</text>
  <text start="727.21" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re buying the bonds they&amp;#39;re passing</text>
  <text start="729.59" dur="3.45">them back and forth to each other</text>
  <text start="730.75" dur="5.59">they&amp;#39;re buying all the stocks the</text>
  <text start="733.04" dur="5.13">equities and the people they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="736.34" dur="5.34">sitting on the sidelines but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="738.17" dur="6.69">always one problem they can keep doing</text>
  <text start="741.68" dur="7.38">this but just like the subprime</text>
  <text start="744.86" dur="9.18">securities the people will eventually</text>
  <text start="749.06" dur="8.72">show and tell the true story of what the</text>
  <text start="754.04" dur="6.71">economy is doing because when the people</text>
  <text start="757.78" dur="5.73">stop purchasing in the retail market</text>
  <text start="760.75" dur="5.29">when the people stop purchasing homes</text>
  <text start="763.51" dur="5.62">when the people stop purchasing stocks</text>
  <text start="766.04" dur="4.89">and it&amp;#39;s only the central bank in there</text>
