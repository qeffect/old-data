  <text start="152.239" dur="5.581">hint of spies reporting from inside</text>
  <text start="154.579" dur="6.811">Moscow&amp;#39;s propaganda machinery and the</text>
  <text start="157.82" dur="5.19">NSA picked up absolutely nothing and we</text>
  <text start="161.39" dur="5.879">have to remember something very very</text>
  <text start="163.01" dur="5.91">important clapper lied under oath to the</text>
  <text start="167.269" dur="5.94">sudden to the Senate Intelligence</text>
  <text start="168.92" dur="9.12">Committee on March 12 2013 about the NSA</text>
  <text start="173.209" dur="9.031">dragnet activities Congress asked him</text>
  <text start="178.04" dur="8.01">are you spying on the American people</text>
  <text start="182.24" dur="7.92">he said no later he apologized but he</text>
  <text start="186.05" dur="6.9">lied when he was asked that question so</text>
  <text start="190.16" dur="6.3">sorry if we don&amp;#39;t trust you right now</text>
  <text start="192.95" dur="4.95">but we need the real hard facts if you</text>
  <text start="196.46" dur="4.98">want us to believe</text>
  <text start="197.9" dur="5.16">now Biden is out there and he was giving</text>
  <text start="201.44" dur="4.43">a speech in the World Economic Forum in</text>
  <text start="203.06" dur="7.71">Davos Switzerland and he took aim at</text>
  <text start="205.87" dur="6.7">Trump and Russian President Putin and he</text>
  <text start="210.77" dur="5.25">was going on about many different things</text>
  <text start="212.57" dur="6.24">but it was scare mongering war rhetoric</text>
  <text start="216.02" dur="5.4">and you have to remember this</text>
  <text start="218.81" dur="5.88">information that comes out is from the</text>
  <text start="221.42" dur="4.53">CIA from the government and they like to</text>
  <text start="224.69" dur="4.11">scare the people because they like to</text>
  <text start="225.95" dur="4.2">scare two people because it allows them</text>
  <text start="228.8" dur="4.26">to do things they normally wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="230.15" dur="5.55">allowed to do they put fear into the</text>
  <text start="233.06" dur="5.79">people and they can pursue other avenues</text>
  <text start="235.7" dur="5.16">and that&amp;#39;s why they have false flags</text>
  <text start="238.85" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s why they use terrorism that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="240.86" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re using cyberattacks this is what</text>
  <text start="243.11" dur="6.87">they&amp;#39;ve been doing and Biden was out</text>
  <text start="246.11" dur="6.36">there and he took aim at Putin and Trump</text>
  <text start="249.98" dur="3.81">saying that there are many countries in</text>
  <text start="252.47" dur="5.34">Europe right now slated to hold</text>
  <text start="253.79" dur="5.97">elections this year and Russia well</text>
  <text start="257.81" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re gonna medal in the democratic</text>
  <text start="259.76" dur="4.5">process once again they&amp;#39;re going to hack</text>
  <text start="261.68" dur="4.29">these countries and we&amp;#39;re gonna see a</text>
  <text start="264.26" dur="5.85">different outcome now what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="265.97" dur="7.11">happening right now is that the elite</text>
  <text start="270.11" dur="5.58">those who were in power they are very</text>
  <text start="273.08" dur="6.09">worried about what is about to happen</text>
  <text start="275.69" dur="6.03">because then they know that people are</text>
  <text start="279.17" dur="5.01">moving in a different direction they</text>
  <text start="281.72" dur="5.34">know they don&amp;#39;t want the leaders that</text>
  <text start="284.18" dur="5.61">are now in control they don&amp;#39;t want them</text>
  <text start="287.06" dur="4.86">anymore they want different people just</text>
  <text start="289.79" dur="4.47">like in the US and these individuals</text>
  <text start="291.92" dur="5.22">well they need to blame someone for this</text>
  <text start="294.26" dur="5.07">it wasn&amp;#39;t their fault it was because of</text>
  <text start="297.14" dur="5.19">Russia they&amp;#39;re changing the election</text>
  <text start="299.33" dur="5.34">results they&amp;#39;re hacking the systems it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.33" dur="4.71">all this fake news and you can see</text>
  <text start="304.67" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re using excuse after excuse to</text>
  <text start="307.04" dur="4.53">explain away why all this is happening</text>
  <text start="308.93" dur="4.5">so the bottom line according to the vice</text>
  <text start="311.57" dur="4.01">president of the only u.s. president to</text>
  <text start="313.43" dur="4.25">have been at war every day of</text>
  <text start="315.58" dur="4.89">their eight-year term the American</text>
  <text start="317.68" dur="4.859">people have unwittingly voted a man into</text>
  <text start="320.47" dur="4.729">office who puts the entire world order</text>
  <text start="322.539" dur="6.331">at risk of collapse</text>
  <text start="325.199" dur="6.4">very interesting so Russian Foreign</text>
  <text start="328.87" dur="5.31">Minister Sergey Lavrov while he snapped</text>
  <text start="331.599" dur="4.651">back and I guess he couldn&amp;#39;t take it</text>
  <text start="334.18" dur="5.609">anymore because he lashed out at the</text>
  <text start="336.25" dur="6.24">ongoing US election scapegoating fiasco</text>
  <text start="339.789" dur="5.19">where they&amp;#39;re blaming Russia saying the</text>
  <text start="342.49" dur="5.31">leaders and top officials from the UK</text>
  <text start="344.979" dur="5.791">Germany France have grossly interfered</text>
  <text start="347.8" dur="5.88">in u.s. internal affairs campaign for</text>
  <text start="350.77" dur="5.639">Hillary Clinton and openly demonized</text>
  <text start="353.68" dur="6.65">Donald Trump and so did the corporate</text>
  <text start="356.409" dur="8.611">media which they always seem to forget</text>
  <text start="360.33" dur="8.649">and this comes back to one thing and one</text>
  <text start="365.02" dur="7.049">thing only they are worried about their</text>
  <text start="368.979" dur="7.231">power they&amp;#39;re worried about losing</text>
  <text start="372.069" dur="6.301">control and they&amp;#39;re nervous and afraid</text>
  <text start="376.21" dur="5.759">because they see what&amp;#39;s happening around</text>
  <text start="378.37" dur="6.75">the globe look what they&amp;#39;ve done to the</text>
  <text start="381.969" dur="5.551">world we&amp;#39;re in a huge amount of debt the</text>

  <text start="394.569" dur="6.03">they can&amp;#39;t get their way out of it</text>
  <text start="396.159" dur="9.29">they&amp;#39;re selling off assets to bankers</text>
  <text start="400.599" dur="10.141">and all the wealth has been siphoned up</text>
  <text start="405.449" dur="9.12">to the 1% and now they want to tax more</text>
  <text start="410.74" dur="8.34">people to pay for what they&amp;#39;ve done and</text>
  <text start="414.569" dur="6.701">the people are saying no and think about</text>
  <text start="419.08" dur="4.11">this go back to the time where there are</text>

  <text start="473.88" dur="8.68">targeting Russia and they are expected</text>
  <text start="476.89" dur="7.68">to finalize this deal by year-end and we</text>
  <text start="482.56" dur="4.68">can see right now that Norway&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="484.57" dur="5.76">wing Prime Minister Erna Solberg already</text>
  <text start="487.24" dur="5.64">said in 2015 statement it is necessary</text>
  <text start="490.33" dur="4.77">for us to participate in this as a</text>
  <text start="492.88" dur="4.56">committed NATO member we should also be</text>
  <text start="495.1" dur="5.67">committed to the part of the strategy</text>
  <text start="497.44" dur="6.06">the missile defense system now this is a</text>
  <text start="500.77" dur="6.06">significant shift from Norway stance 15</text>
  <text start="503.5" dur="4.56">years ago in 2003 when US President</text>
  <text start="506.83" dur="3.6">George W Bush scrapped the</text>
  <text start="508.06" dur="5.13">anti-ballistic missile treaty supposedly</text>
  <text start="510.43" dur="4.289">to counter threats from Iran the move</text>
  <text start="513.19" dur="4.95">was universally condemned across</text>
  <text start="514.719" dur="6.651">Norwegian political spectrum and we can</text>
  <text start="518.14" dur="7.02">see that everyone is climbing aboard the</text>
  <text start="521.37" dur="8.62">Russian aggression train and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="525.16" dur="7.08">preparing for I guess a war because all</text>
  <text start="529.99" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re doing is continually provoking</text>
  <text start="532.24" dur="4.08">Russia by doing this now Russia&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="534.4" dur="3.39">to be setting up their missile system</text>
  <text start="536.32" dur="3.81">because they&amp;#39;re very nervous about what</text>
  <text start="537.79" dur="5.45">NATO and the u.s. is doing in other</text>
  <text start="540.13" dur="6.6">countries that are close to Russia and</text>
  <text start="543.24" dur="5.32">NATO right now fears that the missile</text>
  <text start="546.73" dur="3.66">shield will alter the strategic balance</text>
  <text start="548.56" dur="5.13">and of course this is what&amp;#39;s going to</text>

  <text start="736.63" dur="6.03">happening and we&amp;#39;ll have to wait to see</text>
  <text start="739.09" dur="6.39">what she reports we see the u.s. they</text>

  <text start="779.26" dur="4.98">still pushing towards their goal they</text>
  <text start="781.57" dur="7.95">haven&amp;#39;t let up as of yet now we</text>

  <text start="789.52" dur="7.41">part of Chelsea Manning&amp;#39;s sentence now</text>
  <text start="794.17" dur="4.7">Chelsea Manning was convicted in 2013 of</text>
  <text start="796.93" dur="4.47">leaking hundreds of thousands of</text>

  <text start="821.62" dur="5.85">massive leak of classified intelligence</text>
  <text start="823.57" dur="7.14">information was damaging but not so</text>
  <text start="827.47" dur="6.75">damaging as to warn a 35 year prison</text>
  <text start="830.71" dur="6.15">sentence so how does Obama and his party</text>
  <text start="834.22" dur="5.16">explain the sudden about-face on Manning</text>
  <text start="836.86" dur="5.49">and their forgive and their forgiveness</text>
  <text start="839.38" dur="5.46">of Manning&amp;#39;s intelligence betrayal that</text>
  <text start="842.35" dur="4.86">jeopardized the fabric of u.s. democracy</text>

  <text start="858.069" dur="3.901">level of US military intelligence</text>
  <text start="859.419" dur="5.97">information is now considered forgivable</text>
  <text start="861.97" dur="6.089">or can we simply conclude that Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="865.389" dur="6.331">Red Scare is simply a political ploy to</text>
  <text start="868.059" dur="7.62">damage Trump and excuse Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="871.72" dur="6.449">and to divert attention from the email</text>
  <text start="875.679" dur="6.06">scandal and what&amp;#39;s actually inside the</text>
  <text start="878.169" dur="6.27">emails now Samantha Power&amp;#39;s was out</text>
  <text start="881.739" dur="5.01">there this is the outgoing US ambassador</text>
  <text start="884.439" dur="6.48">to the United Nations and her let in her</text>
  <text start="886.749" dur="6.93">last speech she says something very</text>
  <text start="890.919" dur="5.75">interesting she issued a dire warning</text>
  <text start="893.679" dur="5.4">saying that Putin and his government</text>
  <text start="896.669" dur="5.051">will seek to destabilize the</text>
  <text start="899.079" dur="6.72">international order and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="901.72" dur="7.619">getting started she said it would be</text>
  <text start="905.799" dur="5.01">deeply naive and deeply negligent to</text>
  <text start="909.339" dur="4.02">think that those who have discovered</text>
  <text start="910.809" dur="5.01">vulnerabilities in our system would not</text>
  <text start="913.359" dur="5.46">try to exploit them again and again and</text>
  <text start="915.819" dur="4.62">again and we do have to remember Janet</text>
  <text start="918.819" dur="4.59">Napolitano when she was leaving office</text>
  <text start="920.439" dur="6.39">she was head of DHS said it&amp;#39;s not if we</text>
  <text start="923.409" dur="6.84">are a cyber attack it is when they knew</text>
  <text start="926.829" dur="5.76">at some point that they would have to</text>
  <text start="930.249" dur="4.89">move forward with some type of</text>
  <text start="932.589" dur="4.74">cyberattacks care they would have to</text>
  <text start="935.139" dur="4.5">create it out of thin air they would</text>
  <text start="937.329" dur="4.59">need to use it that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="939.639" dur="4.23">when this is why they&amp;#39;re saying Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="941.919" dur="3.9">going to use it over and over and over</text>
  <text start="943.869" dur="4.351">because they&amp;#39;re getting to that point</text>
  <text start="945.819" dur="4.59">where they&amp;#39;re going to need this event</text>
  <text start="948.22" dur="5.669">to cover up everything that they have</text>
  <text start="950.409" dur="5.97">done now there is an update on Project</text>
  <text start="953.889" dur="4.44">Veritas about disrupt j-20 where they</text>
  <text start="956.379" dur="4.89">were looking to shut down traffic</text>
  <text start="958.329" dur="5.61">chained up trains information was given</text>
  <text start="961.269" dur="5.73">to the police and FBI and those</text>
  <text start="963.939" dur="4.41">individuals now well it looks like</text>
  <text start="966.999" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re not going through with their</text>
  <text start="968.349" dur="5.16">plans at this point but there are other</text>
  <text start="970.629" dur="4.61">groups that are out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="973.509" dur="4.29">looking to completely shut down</text>
  <text start="975.239" dur="3.82">everything during the inauguration and</text>
  <text start="977.799" dur="3.54">again we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch the</text>
  <text start="979.059" dur="4.381">situation very very closely as we get</text>
  <text start="981.339" dur="5.071">closer to this which is</text>
  <text start="983.44" dur="6.62">in about two days or so now the pentacon</text>
  <text start="986.41" dur="6.719">they are planning to build a doomsday</text>
  <text start="990.06" dur="5.529">artillery shell and the shell is going</text>
  <text start="993.129" dur="5.88">to contain an electro magnetic pulse</text>
  <text start="995.589" dur="6.841">weapon and it will be powerful enough to</text>
  <text start="999.009" dur="6.301">cripple an entire city&amp;#39;s electronics it</text>
  <text start="1002.43" dur="5.159">will shut everything down now the</text>
  <text start="1005.31" dur="5.969">Pentagon is calling for a non kinetic</text>
  <text start="1007.589" dur="7.92">effects weapon for a hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="1011.279" dur="7.11">five millimeter projectiles and the</text>
  <text start="1015.509" dur="6.241">shell would be fired and everything will</text>
  <text start="1018.389" dur="6.231">be completely shut down and right now</text>
  <text start="1021.75" dur="6.419">the solicitation from the Pentagon is</text>
  <text start="1024.62" dur="8.64">calling for a non-explosive EMP</text>
  <text start="1028.169" dur="8.221">artillery shell which would cripple</text>
  <text start="1033.26" dur="6.279">infrastructure shut down computer</text>
  <text start="1036.39" dur="5.909">systems and bring the city to a</text>
  <text start="1039.539" dur="4.29">screeching halt which is very</text>
  <text start="1042.299" dur="5.01">interesting at this point in time that</text>
  <text start="1043.829" dur="7.261">they&amp;#39;re looking to do this and it seems</text>
  <text start="1047.309" dur="8.071">that they&amp;#39;re looking for more and more</text>
  <text start="1051.09" dur="7.56">ways of shutting down cities to make it</text>
  <text start="1055.38" dur="6.51">easier for regime change now we</text>
  <text start="1058.65" dur="6.48">understand that these individuals the</text>
  <text start="1061.89" dur="6.919">elite the central bankers their system</text>
  <text start="1065.13" dur="6.029">is coming down it cannot be sustained</text>
  <text start="1068.809" dur="4.12">Biden and all the others are out there</text>
  <text start="1071.159" dur="4.051">realizing even those in Davos</text>
  <text start="1072.929" dur="5.641">Switzerland the elite they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="1075.21" dur="5.969">realizing that the people are not going</text>
  <text start="1078.57" dur="5.28">along with them anymore they&amp;#39;re going in</text>
  <text start="1081.179" dur="6.571">an opposite direction and those leaders</text>
  <text start="1083.85" dur="5.22">that they depend on well they might be</text>
  <text start="1087.75" dur="4.62">voted out of office</text>
  <text start="1089.07" dur="5.28">and as we move closer and closer to</text>
  <text start="1092.37" dur="4.23">these elections as the system</text>
  <text start="1094.35" dur="5.699">deteriorates as they build the narrative</text>
  <text start="1096.6" dur="6.03">of blaming it on Russia blaming it on</text>
  <text start="1100.049" dur="3.771">Trump blaming it on China North Korea</text>
