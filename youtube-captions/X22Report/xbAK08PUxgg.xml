  <text start="335.659" dur="5.03">the problem and as we move forward the</text>
  <text start="338.509" dur="4.521">problem is just going to get worse and</text>
  <text start="340.689" dur="4.6">we can see with the geopolitical</text>
  <text start="343.03" dur="3.52">indicators that we&amp;#39;re receiving the</text>
  <text start="345.289" dur="6">problem is getting worse because</text>
  <text start="346.55" dur="6.51">everything is tied into one entire thing</text>
  <text start="351.289" dur="4.97">that the central banks are controlling</text>
  <text start="353.06" dur="8.13">because remember we have the Middle East</text>
  <text start="356.259" dur="7.421">this entire system is created around the</text>
  <text start="361.19" dur="4.199">petro dollar system and as the petro</text>
  <text start="363.68" dur="3.269">dollar system collapses and as the</text>
  <text start="365.389" dur="3.721">united states loses control over the</text>
  <text start="366.949" dur="5.701">Middle East this affects the entire</text>
  <text start="369.11" dur="5.429">system then we have the debt which the</text>
  <text start="372.65" dur="4.289">central bankers have created it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="374.539" dur="4.141">unsustainable it&amp;#39;s growing there&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="376.939" dur="3.57">enough revenue coming in more and more</text>
  <text start="378.68" dur="5.609">people are losing jobs the interest rate</text>
  <text start="380.509" dur="6.391">need to be kept very very low to just to</text>
  <text start="384.289" dur="4.35">keep everything stable right now there</text>
  <text start="386.9" dur="5.4">are some places around the world like</text>
  <text start="388.639" dur="5.761">Europe and Japan where the interest</text>
  <text start="392.3" dur="4.35">rates had to go to negative to keep</text>
  <text start="394.4" dur="3.629">things steady they&amp;#39;re even talking about</text>
  <text start="396.65" dur="2.449">negative interest rates here in the</text>
  <text start="398.029" dur="4.35">United States because as things</text>
  <text start="399.099" dur="5.141">continually get worse they need to</text>
  <text start="402.379" dur="3.75">adjust and as they keep adjusting</text>
  <text start="404.24" dur="3.929">there&amp;#39;s no place else to go because once</text>
  <text start="406.129" dur="4.201">you&amp;#39;re a negative territory where else</text>
  <text start="408.169" dur="4.381">do you go there is no other place</text>
  <text start="410.33" dur="5.73">because the next step is then a collapse</text>
  <text start="412.55" dur="5.76">and we&amp;#39;re seeing that out throughout</text>
  <text start="416.06" dur="3.659">Europe throughout the Middle East the</text>
  <text start="418.31" dur="3.539">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="419.719" dur="4.95">they are preparing for war they want</text>
  <text start="421.849" dur="4.771">this war to cover up this collapse and</text>
  <text start="424.669" dur="4.291">from all the indicators that I&amp;#39;m looking</text>
  <text start="426.62" dur="4.829">at when I look at the indicators out in</text>
  <text start="428.96" dur="4.799">the Middle East in Europe what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="431.449" dur="5.64">on in the South China Sea we are seeing</text>
  <text start="433.759" dur="5.88">a huge military buildup and these</text>
  <text start="437.089" dur="5.521">indicators are showing that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="439.639" dur="6.21">reason for this they&amp;#39;re preparing to</text>
  <text start="442.61" dur="6.04">provoke a war and we see right now out</text>
  <text start="445.849" dur="5.231">in Kiev Ukraine email</text>
  <text start="448.65" dur="4.769">Terry they have deployed tube and rocket</text>

  <text start="453.419" dur="4.831">agreement to the contact line of dom</text>
  <text start="455.61" dur="4.41">bass and we can see there are more</text>
  <text start="458.25" dur="3.93">troops paid mercenaries coming into this</text>
  <text start="460.02" dur="6.3">area they are preparing for something</text>
  <text start="462.18" dur="9.959">huge in this area we see on October 17th</text>
  <text start="466.32" dur="9.84">there was a close flyby in Syria from us</text>
  <text start="472.139" dur="6.421">Boeing III early warning control system</text>
  <text start="476.16" dur="3.9">AWACS plane and a Russian su-35 bomber</text>
  <text start="478.56" dur="3.54">and of course the United States came</text>
  <text start="480.06" dur="4.05">right out and said Oh Russia you know</text>
  <text start="482.1" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re highly aggressive they</text>
  <text start="484.11" dur="3.839">flew very close and then we come to find</text>
  <text start="486" dur="5.07">out that actually it was the united</text>
  <text start="487.949" dur="6.09">states that did this and actually the</text>
  <text start="491.07" dur="6.659">American Air Force called Russia to</text>
  <text start="494.039" dur="8.341">apologize for the incident and what we</text>
  <text start="497.729" dur="6.331">see happening here is that as the u.s.</text>
  <text start="502.38" dur="5.67">Boeing III airborne early-warning</text>
  <text start="504.06" dur="9.18">control system plane was flying in this</text>
  <text start="508.05" dur="9.419">area it dropped its altitude to provoke</text>
  <text start="513.24" dur="6.39">the Russian su-35 fighter jet and what</text>
  <text start="517.469" dur="4.291">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that as this</text>
  <text start="519.63" dur="5.25">plane was flying over dere Azure in</text>
  <text start="521.76" dur="6.66">eastern Syria the air the American</text>
  <text start="524.88" dur="6.51">aircraft went down almost point 62 miles</text>
  <text start="528.42" dur="6.51">from its flight level and dangerously</text>
  <text start="531.39" dur="7.62">approach the Russian su-35 jet now</text>
  <text start="534.93" dur="8.76">Russia to hold the United States at what</text>
  <text start="539.01" dur="7.11">level the su-35 was flying at to make it</text>
  <text start="543.69" dur="4.41">clear this is where we are we know where</text>
  <text start="546.12" dur="4.95">you are and then all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="548.1" dur="5.76">AWACS plane decided to drop in altitude</text>
  <text start="551.07" dur="6.3">and we can see this was a provocation</text>
  <text start="553.86" dur="5.58">they were using it as propaganda the</text>
  <text start="557.37" dur="4.8">pilots most likely were instructed to do</text>
  <text start="559.44" dur="4.5">this out in my soul in Iraq we</text>
  <text start="562.17" dur="3.81">understand the battle is going on in</text>
  <text start="563.94" dur="3.63">that area and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="565.98" dur="4.109">there&amp;#39;s getting it we&amp;#39;re getting reports</text>
  <text start="567.57" dur="4.8">from Amnesty International that there</text>
  <text start="570.089" dur="5.071">was white phosphorus munitions that have</text>
  <text start="572.37" dur="5.31">been used in this area and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="575.16" dur="4.5">saying is that most likely it came from</text>
  <text start="577.68" dur="4.29">the coalition forces because the</text>
  <text start="579.66" dur="2.85">dispersal pattern appear to resemble the</text>
  <text start="581.97" dur="4.46">u.s. made</text>
  <text start="582.51" dur="8.27">155 millimeter ma 25 a1 projectiles and</text>
  <text start="586.43" dur="8.97">we can see right now from the explosion</text>
  <text start="590.78" dur="7.18">they noticed how it was formed it was a</text>
  <text start="595.4" dur="5.11">wedges of white phosphorus over an area</text>
  <text start="597.96" dur="5.43">of about 250 meters and they say this is</text>
  <text start="600.51" dur="5.76">consistent with the coalition ammunition</text>
  <text start="603.39" dur="6.36">and we can see right now that the forces</text>
  <text start="606.27" dur="6.09">that use this is the us-led coalition or</text>
  <text start="609.75" dur="4.77">the Iraqi security forces or the Kurdish</text>
  <text start="612.36" dur="4.31">Peshmerga because the United States</text>
  <text start="614.52" dur="4.91">supplies them with this type of</text>
  <text start="616.67" dur="4.93">ammunition and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="619.43" dur="5.56">they&amp;#39;re using white phosphorus which</text>
  <text start="621.6" dur="6.84">burns the skin it&amp;#39;s completely illegal</text>
  <text start="624.99" dur="6.87">to use on people and actually they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="628.44" dur="6.93">breaking international law once again we</text>
  <text start="631.86" dur="6.06">see right now that the moderate rebels</text>
