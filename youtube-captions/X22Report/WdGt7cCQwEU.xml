  <text start="98.119" dur="4.86">closed by a positive one they had to</text>
  <text start="101.36" dur="3.719">bring it up to the green so everyone has</text>
  <text start="102.979" dur="4.651">a great holiday season everyone is</text>
  <text start="105.079" dur="4.201">convinced that the market is okay i mean</text>
  <text start="107.63" dur="3.39">we had the high frequency traders the</text>
  <text start="109.28" dur="4.11">plunge protection team doing whatever</text>
  <text start="111.02" dur="4.529">they possibly could to bring this market</text>
  <text start="113.39" dur="5.28">up but we&amp;#39;re starting to see a lot of</text>
  <text start="115.549" dur="4.381">these indicators completely separate</text>
  <text start="118.67" dur="3.059">from what the government is trying to</text>
  <text start="119.93" dur="5.399">tell us and a lot of these agencies are</text>
  <text start="121.729" dur="4.831">now showing different information i mean</text>
  <text start="125.329" dur="2.551">if we look at the conference board which</text>
  <text start="126.56" dur="2.66">is funded by the government and we look</text>
  <text start="127.88" dur="3.65">at you Mitch and we look at Bloomberg</text>
  <text start="129.22" dur="6.549">most of these are headed in all</text>
  <text start="131.53" dur="6.579">different directions but what we know</text>
  <text start="135.769" dur="6.151">right now is consumer confidence is</text>
  <text start="138.109" dur="6.72">continually falling people right now do</text>
  <text start="141.92" dur="5.76">not believe the government that this</text>
  <text start="144.829" dur="6.331">economy is improving they feel</text>
  <text start="147.68" dur="5.7">something&amp;#39;s wrong and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="151.16" dur="4.799">interesting is the continuing jobless</text>
  <text start="153.38" dur="4.29">claims for the last four weeks they have</text>
  <text start="155.959" dur="4.441">risen by two point eight five percent</text>
  <text start="157.67" dur="5.159">they have been falling all of this time</text>
  <text start="160.4" dur="4.169">and now they started to pop up a little</text>
  <text start="162.829" dur="5.371">bit but during this period of time</text>
  <text start="164.569" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;ve had layoffs hundreds of thousands</text>
  <text start="168.2" dur="4.73">of people laid off and we see that</text>
  <text start="169.819" dur="6.15">nobody is claiming unemployment</text>
  <text start="172.93" dur="7.47">insurance which kind of makes no sense</text>
  <text start="175.969" dur="7.711">whatsoever but here what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="180.4" dur="5.679">which doesn&amp;#39;t fit the model of the</text>
  <text start="183.68" dur="5.699">government and the central bankers is</text>
  <text start="186.079" dur="6.27">that people are not going out and</text>
  <text start="189.379" dur="6.151">spending their money and they were</text>
  <text start="192.349" dur="5.51">hoping by these lower gas prices by</text>
  <text start="195.53" dur="5.099">convincing everyone that the job market</text>
  <text start="197.859" dur="5.59">was fixed we&amp;#39;re in a complete recovery</text>
  <text start="200.629" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re at five percent that everyone</text>
  <text start="203.449" dur="5.21">would say okay everything is fine i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="205.609" dur="6.3">gonna go spend their money in retail and</text>
  <text start="208.659" dur="7.571">what we see is in october personal</text>
  <text start="211.909" dur="6.991">spending really didn&amp;#39;t go anywhere most</text>
  <text start="216.23" dur="5.069">of the people are hoarding their money</text>
  <text start="218.9" dur="4.049">they&amp;#39;re nervous they&amp;#39;re afraid because</text>
  <text start="221.299" dur="3.991">all these people that have got laid off</text>
  <text start="222.949" dur="4.4">they realize there&amp;#39;s no jobs out there</text>
  <text start="225.29" dur="4.469">and those people that have gotten work</text>
  <text start="227.349" dur="4.57">it&amp;#39;s not the high-paying jobs they once</text>
  <text start="229.759" dur="5.671">had most people are getting part-time</text>
  <text start="231.919" dur="5.07">jobs and a lot of these people are</text>
  <text start="235.43" dur="4.38">putting their money and keeping it in</text>
  <text start="236.989" dur="6.06">the bank and they&amp;#39;re keeping it there</text>
  <text start="239.81" dur="5.669">because this is all they have left but</text>
  <text start="243.049" dur="4.02">what&amp;#39;s very scary about this is that we</text>
  <text start="245.479" dur="4.921">know the government is planning for a</text>
  <text start="247.069" dur="5.04">major collapse of the system we</text>
  <text start="250.4" dur="4.35">understand once this happens there will</text>
  <text start="252.109" dur="5.581">be balanced and a lot of these people</text>
  <text start="254.75" dur="5.759">are going to have their money stuck in</text>
  <text start="257.69" dur="6.27">the banking system they will not be able</text>
  <text start="260.509" dur="6.84">to access it and this was this is what</text>
  <text start="263.96" dur="6.9">scares me the most so right now you as</text>
  <text start="267.349" dur="5.581">consumers they are unwilling to spend</text>
  <text start="270.86" dur="3.95">their money out in the stores and this</text>
  <text start="272.93" dur="4.56">is how we can tell already at the retail</text>
  <text start="274.81" dur="5.71">sales for this holiday season is going</text>
  <text start="277.49" dur="4.32">to be a complete disaster now since the</text>
  <text start="280.52" dur="5.399">people aren&amp;#39;t spending their money we</text>
  <text start="281.81" dur="8.22">see durable good orders they are showing</text>
  <text start="285.919" dur="7.651">right now a seven month in a row lows</text>
  <text start="290.03" dur="6.66">they&amp;#39;re continually declining and they</text>
  <text start="293.57" dur="4.62">fall in year-over-year and this is your</text>
  <text start="296.69" dur="3.99">washer your dryers</text>
  <text start="298.19" dur="4.83">all these type of equipment people are</text>
  <text start="300.68" dur="5.4">not going out and purchasing these type</text>
  <text start="303.02" dur="5.37">of goods in the real estate market we</text>
  <text start="306.08" dur="3.72">see mortgage applications they have</text>
  <text start="308.39" dur="4.83">fallen again by three-point-two percent</text>
  <text start="309.8" dur="6.15">ending the week of November 20th and new</text>
  <text start="313.22" dur="6.69">home sales completely missed</text>
  <text start="315.95" dur="6.33">expectations so right now new home sales</text>
  <text start="319.91" dur="3.51">in which we find that in October a total</text>
  <text start="322.28" dur="3.15">of about four hundred ninety-five</text>
  <text start="323.42" dur="4.29">thousand new homes were sold of which</text>
  <text start="325.43" dur="4.89">just a hundred and forty-six thousand</text>
  <text start="327.71" dur="4.71">were completed the lowest in the past</text>

  <text start="340.25" dur="8.94">been started this was the highest print</text>
  <text start="345.14" dur="5.9">since 2007 still the headline numbers</text>
  <text start="349.19" dur="6.93">while rising for the last month our</text>
  <text start="351.04" dur="9.82">downward revised to 447,000 missed</text>
  <text start="356.12" dur="7.53">expectations of 500,000 and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="360.86" dur="7.14">that median home prices yeah they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="363.65" dur="9.269">falling from 307,000 in September to now</text>
  <text start="368" dur="6.15">to 281,000 the lowest in 13 months so</text>

  <text start="381.41" dur="8.88">starting to completely fall apart and</text>
  <text start="386.08" dur="8.01">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that this</text>
  <text start="390.29" dur="8.61">real estate market has gone absolutely</text>
  <text start="394.09" dur="6.37">nowhere since this great recovery that</text>
  <text start="398.9" dur="4.46">the US government central bankers are</text>
  <text start="400.46" dur="6.98">trying to convince us of and as we know</text>
