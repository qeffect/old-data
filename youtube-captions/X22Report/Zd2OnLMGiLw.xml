  <text start="120.32" dur="6.1">because Trump of the Patriots they know</text>
  <text start="122.96" dur="7.779">they need to control the narrative of</text>
  <text start="126.42" dur="9.42">the economy allow the plan to move</text>
  <text start="130.739" dur="7.611">forward and continue making everyone</text>
  <text start="135.84" dur="4.59">believe that the Federal Reserve is</text>
  <text start="138.35" dur="4.12">completely independent it&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="140.43" dur="4.619">optics we&amp;#39;re going to be talking about</text>
  <text start="142.47" dur="5.22">that in just a moment but first as we</text>
  <text start="145.049" dur="4.831">know we have two systems which are</text>
  <text start="147.69" dur="5.49">operating at the same time we have the</text>
  <text start="149.88" dur="5.43">one system where the Patriot they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="153.18" dur="3.75">trying to continually keep it</text>
  <text start="155.31" dur="5.16">operational this is the central bank</text>
  <text start="156.93" dur="6.66">system we also have the new economic</text>
  <text start="160.47" dur="4.36">system which will be coming online very</text>
  <text start="163.59" dur="3.94">very soon</text>
  <text start="164.83" dur="7.26">and I do believe we&amp;#39;re gonna hear a lot</text>
  <text start="167.53" dur="8.91">more about sound money about what is</text>
  <text start="172.09" dur="7.32">coming to allow the American people to</text>
  <text start="176.44" dur="5.64">understand what is happening but when</text>
  <text start="179.41" dur="6.18">you look at the central bank system it</text>
  <text start="182.08" dur="6.24">is completely imploding on itself now we</text>
  <text start="185.59" dur="4.71">know the Fed their entire playing along</text>
  <text start="188.32" dur="4.14">with the deeps aid was to raise interest</text>
  <text start="190.3" dur="4.17">rates we knows we know what exactly</text>
  <text start="192.46" dur="5.76">happens when you raise interest rates we</text>
  <text start="194.47" dur="6.63">talked about this prior to 2008 the</text>
  <text start="198.22" dur="5.55">central bank knew that the entire system</text>
  <text start="201.1" dur="5.04">was doomed so what did they do they</text>
  <text start="203.77" dur="4.5">started to raise rates as soon as it hit</text>
  <text start="206.14" dur="3.72">a certain point everything started to</text>
  <text start="208.27" dur="5.13">fall apart and what do they do they</text>
  <text start="209.86" dur="5.88">dropped it as quickly as possible well</text>
  <text start="213.4" dur="4.47">the same thing here they were trying to</text>
  <text start="215.74" dur="3.87">raise rates Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="217.87" dur="4.77">called them out on it took control and</text>
  <text start="219.61" dur="6.75">before we hit that point before</text>
  <text start="222.64" dur="6.78">everything just fell apart all of a</text>
  <text start="226.36" dur="6.3">sudden the Fed paused and now Trump is</text>
  <text start="229.42" dur="5.16">asking them to cut rates but when you</text>
  <text start="232.66" dur="3.12">look at the system number it looking at</text>
  <text start="234.58" dur="3.81">many different indicators nothing&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="235.78" dur="5.76">changed by the way since 2008 the</text>
  <text start="238.39" dur="6.06">financial crisis nothing really has</text>
  <text start="241.54" dur="4.95">changed all the manipulation everything</text>
  <text start="244.45" dur="6.57">is still in place Trump is just using</text>
  <text start="246.49" dur="7.14">this against them and if the rates stay</text>
  <text start="251.02" dur="4.83">where they are or rise guess what the</text>
  <text start="253.63" dur="6.27">entire system falls apart and remember</text>
  <text start="255.85" dur="6.84">everyone&amp;#39;s wealth has to do with homes a</text>
  <text start="259.9" dur="6.36">lot of people they depend on their homes</text>
  <text start="262.69" dur="6.36">and over many many years they hope that</text>
  <text start="266.26" dur="5.52">they appreciate they go up in value and</text>
  <text start="269.05" dur="5.1">they pay off their mortgage they use</text>
  <text start="271.78" dur="5.82">this as a little nest egg if your home</text>
  <text start="274.15" dur="4.74">is losing value and you&amp;#39;re paying off</text>
  <text start="277.6" dur="3.75">your mortgage and the value of your home</text>
  <text start="278.89" dur="5.31">continually declines you don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="281.35" dur="4.86">nest egg and what&amp;#39;s happening since the</text>
  <text start="284.2" dur="4.44">rates were rising it kicked many</text>
  <text start="286.21" dur="5.88">first-time homebuyers completely out of</text>
  <text start="288.64" dur="8.67">the market now couple this with rising</text>
  <text start="292.09" dur="6.57">home prices and rising rates first-time</text>
  <text start="297.31" dur="3.15">homebuyers</text>
  <text start="298.66" dur="5.31">they couldn&amp;#39;t even get into the market</text>
  <text start="300.46" dur="5.82">and this is exactly what we saw and are</text>
  <text start="303.97" dur="5.31">still sing because the share of</text>
  <text start="306.28" dur="9.2">first-time buyers has been on a downward</text>
  <text start="309.28" dur="12.24">trend and it is dropped 33 percent since</text>
  <text start="315.48" dur="8.53">2018 which is not a good sign and this</text>
  <text start="321.52" dur="4.86">tells us that something has to change</text>
  <text start="324.01" dur="5.31">either bring down the housing that the</text>
  <text start="326.38" dur="5.82">prices of homes or bring down the rates</text>
  <text start="329.32" dur="5.46">to a level where people can get into the</text>
  <text start="332.2" dur="3.84">market and I do believe this is what</text>
  <text start="334.78" dur="4.41">Trump of the Patriots are trying to do</text>
  <text start="336.04" dur="6.24">now we need to remember that this is all</text>
  <text start="339.19" dur="4.98">about optics optics are very important</text>
  <text start="342.28" dur="3.75">when it comes to the economy first of</text>
  <text start="344.17" dur="4.23">all if you control the narrative of the</text>
  <text start="346.03" dur="4.23">economy you can control what happens</text>
  <text start="348.4" dur="3.93">with the election because the people do</text>
  <text start="350.26" dur="5.13">believe that the economy is doing very</text>
  <text start="352.33" dur="5.97">very well well guess what they like that</text>
  <text start="355.39" dur="4.83">because people will look at their wallet</text>
  <text start="358.3" dur="4.02">look at what&amp;#39;s happening and they&amp;#39;ll say</text>
  <text start="360.22" dur="3.9">I like what&amp;#39;s happening I want this</text>
  <text start="362.32" dur="3.36">person to stay because I&amp;#39;d be very</text>
  <text start="364.12" dur="3.12">nervous for the new person coming in</text>
  <text start="365.68" dur="5.28">because I don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="367.24" dur="6.56">to do and Trump he criticizes the Fed</text>
  <text start="370.96" dur="5.58">tells the Fed to cut rate start stimulus</text>
  <text start="373.8" dur="5.23">now again he&amp;#39;s criticizing the Fed</text>
  <text start="376.54" dur="4.92">trying to tell the Fed this is what we</text>
  <text start="379.03" dur="4.26">need now the Fed they just can&amp;#39;t do this</text>
  <text start="381.46" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re not just gonna Oh Trump just</text>
  <text start="383.29" dur="3.93">said that let&amp;#39;s just lower the rates he</text>
  <text start="385.57" dur="4.53">will look completely obvious they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="387.22" dur="5.76">independent and the Fed needs to look</text>
  <text start="390.1" dur="8.28">independent at this point and this is</text>
  <text start="392.98" dur="9.3">why the Fed takes their time the Fed</text>
  <text start="398.38" dur="6.45">will push back the Fed will say okay we</text>
  <text start="402.28" dur="5.07">need to analyze the situation we need to</text>
  <text start="404.83" dur="4.8">look at the numbers we need to see and</text>
  <text start="407.35" dur="6.69">you know what while we&amp;#39;re looking we</text>
  <text start="409.63" dur="7.5">will pause the rates right now now the</text>
  <text start="414.04" dur="5.37">Fed is still not listening to Trump it</text>
  <text start="417.13" dur="3.48">looks like the Fed is completely</text>
  <text start="419.41" dur="4.17">independent and they&amp;#39;re making their</text>
  <text start="420.61" dur="4.86">decisions now should the Fed be cutting</text>
  <text start="423.58" dur="3.69">rates at this point it doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="425.47" dur="3.96">matter because the whole thing is built</text>
  <text start="427.27" dur="4.35">on an illusion if they raise rates the</text>
  <text start="429.43" dur="3.09">entire system falls apart if they lower</text>
  <text start="431.62" dur="3.06">rates this</text>
  <text start="432.52" dur="5.549">just chugs along the way it is is it</text>
  <text start="434.68" dur="7.1">going to improve the system no but the</text>
  <text start="438.069" dur="8.31">Fed needs to push back because of optics</text>
  <text start="441.78" dur="7.629">then the Fed for optics will make</text>
  <text start="446.379" dur="6.331">decisions put it off and tell Trump</text>
  <text start="449.409" dur="6.871">we&amp;#39;re looking into it and maybe we won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="452.71" dur="7.709">be doing it at all and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="456.28" dur="7.259">Fed is doing just that the Fed will then</text>
  <text start="460.419" dur="5.671">come out and explain why they will</text>
  <text start="463.539" dur="6.571">eventually do rate cuts now Powell has</text>
  <text start="466.09" dur="6.84">already made that case why the Fed is</text>
  <text start="470.11" dur="5.369">going to do rate cuts we&amp;#39;re at that</text>
  <text start="472.93" dur="5.91">point where the Fed is pushing back</text>
  <text start="475.479" dur="5.671">saying maybe we won&amp;#39;t be doing it but</text>
  <text start="478.84" dur="5">eventually they will say from their</text>
  <text start="481.15" dur="6.09">analysis we&amp;#39;re going to cut rates</text>
  <text start="483.84" dur="7.27">doesn&amp;#39;t matter how much they will end up</text>
  <text start="487.24" dur="6.6">doing it meanwhile while all that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="491.11" dur="5.57">going on Trump is going to explain how</text>
  <text start="493.84" dur="6.69">great the economy is remember optics</text>
  <text start="496.68" dur="6.039">economy&amp;#39;s great Trump made it great when</text>
  <text start="500.53" dur="5.069">the Fed pull his rates the market went</text>
  <text start="502.719" dur="6.151">up unemployment went down this is what</text>
  <text start="505.599" dur="6.781">Trump said to do the Fed listened and</text>
  <text start="508.87" dur="5.37">the economy got better well if you look</text>
  <text start="512.38" dur="4.89">at the manipulated statistical numbers</text>
  <text start="514.24" dur="5.099">yes it did get better so think about</text>
  <text start="517.27" dur="4.889">what Trump is doing he&amp;#39;s telling the Fed</text>
  <text start="519.339" dur="6.151">listen if you listen to me the economy</text>
  <text start="522.159" dur="6.12">will get a lot better I told you to stop</text>
  <text start="525.49" dur="5.67">raising rates you did the economy looks</text>
  <text start="528.279" dur="5.401">great I&amp;#39;m telling you to cut rates start</text>
  <text start="531.16" dur="6.869">stimulus the economy will look even</text>
  <text start="533.68" dur="5.88">better Trump right now from everyone</text>
  <text start="538.029" dur="4.411">looking at him and everything that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="539.56" dur="7.29">saying he everything that he&amp;#39;s saying is</text>
  <text start="542.44" dur="9.8">coming true which means he is the driver</text>
  <text start="546.85" dur="9.84">the Fed is the passenger and Trump is</text>
  <text start="552.24" dur="5.68">driving the Fed where he wants and Trump</text>
  <text start="556.69" dur="4.709">is right on schedule</text>
  <text start="557.92" dur="6.6">he needs to continually say the economy</text>
  <text start="561.399" dur="5.091">is fantastic because of him and if the</text>
  <text start="564.52" dur="5.21">Fed doesn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="566.49" dur="5.4">he says the economy will not get even</text>
  <text start="569.73" dur="5.28">better he tweeted out the following</text>
  <text start="571.89" dur="5.639">economic numbers reached an all-time</text>
  <text start="575.01" dur="5.16">high the best in our country&amp;#39;s history</text>
  <text start="577.529" dur="5.641">great to be part of something so good</text>
  <text start="580.17" dur="4.039">for so many there&amp;#39;s a reason why he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="583.17" dur="7.14">doing this</text>
  <text start="584.209" dur="8.141">he&amp;#39;s creating the entire show to make</text>
  <text start="590.31" dur="5.55">people understand and this is why he</text>
  <text start="592.35" dur="5.28">continually tweets out the statistical</text>
  <text start="595.86" dur="4.86">numbers of how the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="597.63" dur="6">where he says in a record number of 157</text>
  <text start="600.72" dur="4.95">million employed 19th record of Trump</text>
  <text start="603.63" dur="4.47">error America created two hundred and</text>
  <text start="605.67" dur="3.78">twenty four thousand jobs in June four</text>
  <text start="608.1" dur="4.26">hundred eighty thousand manufacturing</text>
  <text start="609.45" dur="5.579">jobs added since Trump&amp;#39;s election and he</text>
  <text start="612.36" dur="6.21">continually puts this out there to let</text>
  <text start="615.029" dur="6.75">people know that he is the one taking</text>
  <text start="618.57" dur="6.329">what was so bad and making it so great</text>
  <text start="621.779" dur="4.051">and if the Fed doesn&amp;#39;t follow it is the</text>
  <text start="624.899" dur="3.661">feds fault</text>
  <text start="625.83" dur="5.069">but the Fed is going to do exactly what</text>
  <text start="628.56" dur="4.49">Trump says yes they&amp;#39;re gonna push back</text>
  <text start="630.899" dur="5.25">yes they&amp;#39;re gonna say no but eventually</text>
  <text start="633.05" dur="6.849">they&amp;#39;re gonna do exactly what he wants</text>
  <text start="636.149" dur="5.911">them to do now very interestingly we we</text>
  <text start="639.899" dur="4.56">need to go back a little bit because Q</text>
  <text start="642.06" dur="5.79">has told us that the Fed will be</text>
  <text start="644.459" dur="5.161">restructured and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="647.85" dur="4.679">entire plan and we step back a little</text>
  <text start="649.62" dur="4.8">bit we can see how this could happen now</text>
  <text start="652.529" dur="5.31">think about what he&amp;#39;s been doing with</text>
  <text start="654.42" dur="6.06">Powell he continually criticizes Powell</text>
  <text start="657.839" dur="3.87">he says I like the fire Powell but he</text>
  <text start="660.48" dur="4.609">can keep his job right now</text>
  <text start="661.709" dur="8.13">he did this with sessions again optics</text>
  <text start="665.089" dur="7.631">sessions resigned once Trump has certain</text>
  <text start="669.839" dur="4.231">individuals in place those individuals</text>
  <text start="672.72" dur="4.77">that believe in gold those people that</text>
  <text start="674.07" dur="7.38">believe in sound money restructuring can</text>
  <text start="677.49" dur="5.55">happen now restructuring can happen just</text>
  <text start="681.45" dur="3.629">with a couple people on the board you</text>
  <text start="683.04" dur="4.169">need someone leading all this and I</text>
  <text start="685.079" dur="4.141">think what they&amp;#39;re doing with all of</text>
  <text start="687.209" dur="4.891">this and using the same plan as sessions</text>
  <text start="689.22" dur="4.8">and bringing in like Barr I think what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="692.1" dur="5.46">happening here is they&amp;#39;re building up</text>
  <text start="694.02" dur="6.33">that Powell is no good it&amp;#39;s taking too</text>
  <text start="697.56" dur="6.27">long to listen and eventually I think</text>
  <text start="700.35" dur="5.4">Pawel is going to resign I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="703.83" dur="3.33">Trump is going to fire him just like he</text>
