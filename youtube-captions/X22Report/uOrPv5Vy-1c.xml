  <text start="224.21" dur="8.77">so this is very interesting we see this</text>
  <text start="227.7" dur="7.53">entire buildup moving towards the</text>
  <text start="232.98" dur="4.26">declassification of the IG report</text>
  <text start="235.23" dur="6.48">because he did say it in his tweet I</text>
  <text start="237.24" dur="6.15">might have to get involved in this now</text>
  <text start="241.71" dur="3.51">this is very interesting because we</text>
  <text start="243.39" dur="2.99">talked about this and here we are in the</text>
  <text start="245.22" dur="3.48">month of August</text>
  <text start="246.38" dur="4.3">hopefully in the next couple of days</text>
  <text start="248.7" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s all gonna start to come down we</text>
  <text start="250.68" dur="4.47">know that cue said it&amp;#39;s Showtime there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="253.17" dur="4.439">no more previews so it looks like</text>
  <text start="255.15" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;re building this up getting the</text>
  <text start="257.609" dur="6.001">public used to the idea of what has been</text>
  <text start="261.03" dur="7.41">happening now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="263.61" dur="6.87">the DNC they are suing WikiLeaks and the</text>
  <text start="268.44" dur="4.53">Democratic National Committee officially</text>
  <text start="270.48" dur="6.63">served its lawsuit to WikiLeaks through</text>
  <text start="272.97" dur="7.38">their unconventional means of Twitter so</text>
  <text start="277.11" dur="6.17">they put out a tweet and they had all</text>
  <text start="280.35" dur="6.05">the documents there and this is how they</text>
  <text start="283.28" dur="4.24">went ahead and officially served</text>
  <text start="286.4" dur="3.79">WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="287.52" dur="4.41">which is kind of strange and of course</text>
  <text start="290.19" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re going after WikiLeaks because of</text>
  <text start="291.93" dur="5.55">all the documents and things like that</text>
  <text start="293.61" dur="6.42">that WikiLeaks dumped and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="297.48" dur="6.48">to go after WikiLeaks now we talked</text>
  <text start="300.03" dur="9.54">about how there was a plane a 155-foot</text>
  <text start="303.96" dur="8.67">Boeing 757 that was in Little Rock and a</text>
  <text start="309.57" dur="4.86">radio station krn reported that you know</text>
  <text start="312.63" dur="3.81">why is this plane here belongs to the</text>
  <text start="314.43" dur="5.16">FBI looks like they&amp;#39;re going after</text>
  <text start="316.44" dur="6.27">Clinton or doing something in this area</text>
  <text start="319.59" dur="4.41">and the FBI responded to this because</text>
  <text start="322.71" dur="4.95">there were so many questions about it</text>
  <text start="324" dur="4.89">and this FBI airline I made two trips to</text>
  <text start="327.66" dur="3.81">Little Rock Arkansas</text>
  <text start="328.89" dur="6.15">stirring up a discussion and speculation</text>
  <text start="331.47" dur="5.07">at this local radio station that there</text>
  <text start="335.04" dur="3.96">might be a possible connection to the</text>
  <text start="336.54" dur="4.14">Clinton Foundation the FBI however</text>
  <text start="339" dur="4.98">stated the plane was there because of a</text>
  <text start="340.68" dur="5.43">major drug bust the plane 155-foot</text>
  <text start="343.98" dur="4.88">Boeing 77223</text>
  <text start="346.11" dur="5.34">took off on August 7th around 9 a.m.</text>
  <text start="348.86" dur="4.51">likely from Richmond Virginia and landed</text>
  <text start="351.45" dur="4.59">around noon at the Clinton National</text>
  <text start="353.37" dur="4.32">Airport in Little Rock around 12:00 it</text>
  <text start="356.04" dur="4.32">took off again and returned likely to</text>
  <text start="357.69" dur="5.91">Richmond now according to flight tracker</text>
  <text start="360.36" dur="5.94">flightradar24 the site seems to have</text>
  <text start="363.6" dur="5.76">only track the plane on the way but not</text>
  <text start="366.3" dur="5.76">during the takeoff and landing making it</text>
  <text start="369.36" dur="5.07">more difficult to conclusively say where</text>
  <text start="372.06" dur="6.08">it took off from and where it landed</text>
  <text start="374.43" dur="6.75">Little Rock&amp;#39;s Newsradio 102.9 krn</text>
  <text start="378.14" dur="5.73">reported that day that federal agents</text>
  <text start="381.18" dur="6.81">have been spotted loading boxes onto the</text>
  <text start="383.87" dur="8.1">757 now the FBI they&amp;#39;re saying the plane</text>
  <text start="387.99" dur="8.43">was there the FBI agents were there to</text>
  <text start="391.97" dur="6.46">break up this drug ring and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="396.42" dur="4.53">saying there were seven people that were</text>
  <text start="398.43" dur="5.43">arrested there and they were selling</text>
  <text start="400.95" dur="5.55">cocaine crack cocaine and marijuana now</text>
  <text start="403.86" dur="4.41">isn&amp;#39;t this really a job for the police I</text>
  <text start="406.5" dur="3.36">mean they&amp;#39;re selling cocaine crack</text>
  <text start="408.27" dur="5.34">cocaine and marijuana and there&amp;#39;s seven</text>
  <text start="409.86" dur="5.28">people they needed an FBI in a 757 to</text>
  <text start="413.61" dur="3.99">fly in back and forth and they were</text>
  <text start="415.14" dur="4.77">loading boxes and they&amp;#39;re saying you</text>
  <text start="417.6" dur="4.43">know the FBI was there for this reason</text>
  <text start="419.91" dur="5.31">now this seems a little difficult to</text>
  <text start="422.03" dur="5.32">believe because it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="425.22" dur="4.23">and again the plane was moving back and</text>
  <text start="427.35" dur="4.59">forth many many times coming in and out</text>
  <text start="429.45" dur="5.97">we know jeff sessions also visited</text>
  <text start="431.94" dur="6.45">little rock prior to this so something</text>
  <text start="435.42" dur="5.31">else might be happening in this area and</text>
  <text start="438.39" dur="4.68">q actually came out and kind of</text>
  <text start="440.73" dur="5.52">confirmed that there is something else</text>
  <text start="443.07" dur="6.03">happening in this area we see out in</text>
  <text start="446.25" dur="5.01">Afghanistan we talked about how these</text>
  <text start="449.1" dur="4.38">poppy fields in Afghanistan they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="451.26" dur="4.95">being guarded by the deep state</text>
  <text start="453.48" dur="6.96">use soldiers to guard these fields and</text>
  <text start="456.21" dur="7.56">these poppy fields they have grown in</text>
  <text start="460.44" dur="5.58">the number of fields they have expanded</text>
  <text start="463.77" dur="4.68">across the country and it seems very</text>
  <text start="466.02" dur="4.77">similar to Syria where we saw the</text>
  <text start="468.45" dur="4.71">Islamic state and once the u.s. the deep</text>
  <text start="470.79" dur="3.92">state got involved the amount of land</text>
  <text start="473.16" dur="5.37">that the Islamic state took over</text>
  <text start="474.71" dur="5.89">expanded so when we look at this we can</text>
  <text start="478.53" dur="6.06">say something is wrong here well now we</text>
  <text start="480.6" dur="7.44">do have proof our conspiracy as the fake</text>
  <text start="484.59" dur="6.06">media likes to call it has come true</text>
  <text start="488.04" dur="4.05">once again a recent report from the</text>
  <text start="490.65" dur="4.05">Special Inspector General for</text>
  <text start="492.09" dur="6.09">Afghanistan reconstruction reveals that</text>
  <text start="494.7" dur="7.77">US taxpayers spent 8.6 2 billion in</text>
  <text start="498.18" dur="7.02">Afghanistan between 2002 and 2017 solely</text>
  <text start="502.47" dur="5.88">on combating poppy cultivation and drug</text>
  <text start="505.2" dur="5.28">production the result was an absolute</text>
  <text start="508.35" dur="4.31">failure and the report confirmed that</text>
  <text start="510.48" dur="7.05">Afghanistan remains the world&amp;#39;s largest</text>
  <text start="512.66" dur="8.95">opium producer and opium poppy is the</text>
  <text start="517.53" dur="6.68">country&amp;#39;s largest cash crop now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="521.61" dur="5.82">interesting about all of this is that</text>
  <text start="524.21" dur="6.37">before the u.s. invaded Afghanistan in</text>
  <text start="527.43" dur="7.14">2001 poppy cultivation was actually at</text>
  <text start="530.58" dur="6.36">an all-time low and right after 2001</text>
  <text start="534.57" dur="5.55">that&amp;#39;s when you saw all these poppy</text>
  <text start="536.94" dur="4.83">fields start to pop up now according to</text>
  <text start="540.12" dur="4.62">a report from the United Nations Office</text>
  <text start="541.77" dur="5.79">on Drugs and Crime and Afghanistan&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.74" dur="5.52">Ministry of counter narcotics which is</text>
  <text start="547.56" dur="6.09">published in November 2017 the area</text>

  <text start="553.65" dur="7.41">by 63% since 2016 reaching a new record</text>
  <text start="557.91" dur="4.53">high and we can see right now that when</text>
  <text start="561.06" dur="2.7">we talked about poppy fields and we</text>
  <text start="562.44" dur="3.15">talked about the deep state being in</text>
  <text start="563.76" dur="4.47">there using opium to pay for their</text>
  <text start="565.59" dur="6">covert operations it&amp;#39;s all turning out</text>
  <text start="568.23" dur="5.18">to be absolutely true now this is very</text>
  <text start="571.59" dur="4.26">interesting because we know that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="573.41" dur="5.32">sanctions being placed on Iran we know</text>
  <text start="575.85" dur="5.3">from cue that Iran is next trying to get</text>
  <text start="578.73" dur="4.77">the mullahs out of there the deep state</text>

  <text start="951.69" dur="3.93">not that difficult all you have to do is</text>

  <text start="1534.15" dur="5.37">maybe the q400 pilot name is actually a</text>

  <text start="1572.52" dur="6.21">with John F Kennedy and this is all very</text>
  <text start="1576.929" dur="7.591">interesting so when we look at the</text>
  <text start="1578.73" dur="11.579">flight path for this plane it flew in</text>
  <text start="1584.52" dur="9.27">circles and then made a turn which when</text>
  <text start="1590.309" dur="8.401">you look at it it&amp;#39;s the letter Q so an</text>
  <text start="1593.79" dur="8.73">an on put up a theory here q400 was</text>

  <text start="1608.79" dur="5.46">path is Q and we showed this in the</text>
  <text start="1612.27" dur="3.06">picture that we have on the x-22 report</text>
  <text start="1614.25" dur="3.14">if you&amp;#39;re on YouTube you can see the</text>

  <text start="1627.3" dur="8.73">shoot down missile plane brought down on</text>
  <text start="1630.6" dur="7.89">an island to draw attention and once</text>
  <text start="1636.03" dur="6.53">again this individual who is not a pilot</text>
  <text start="1638.49" dur="6.99">was able to to fly this plane and</text>
  <text start="1642.56" dur="4.3">maneuver it the way he was doing it now</text>
  <text start="1645.48" dur="3.63">if you listen to the recordings</text>
  <text start="1646.86" dur="4.5">the pilot first of all he was very low</text>
  <text start="1649.11" dur="4.59">he wasn&amp;#39;t high up in the air</text>
  <text start="1651.36" dur="5.069">you weren&amp;#39;t losing oxygen if you ever</text>
  <text start="1653.7" dur="6.09">been in a plane you can be at that out</text>
  <text start="1656.429" dur="5.37">to even higher 15,000 feet and guess</text>
  <text start="1659.79" dur="3.9">what you can still breathe you don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="1661.799" dur="3.931">lightheaded or anything like that and</text>
  <text start="1663.69" dur="3.63">this individual during the recording</text>
  <text start="1665.73" dur="3.54">saying oh he needs to pressurize the</text>
  <text start="1667.32" dur="4.16">cabin I&amp;#39;m getting lightheaded and things</text>
  <text start="1669.27" dur="4.8">like that which is kind of strange and</text>
  <text start="1671.48" dur="4.3">when we look at this we can see that</text>
  <text start="1674.07" dur="3">this individual and he says oh he can</text>
  <text start="1675.78" dur="3.149">fly the plane because he played video</text>
  <text start="1677.07" dur="3.84">games before which is kind of ridiculous</text>
  <text start="1678.929" dur="4.321">and itself because there&amp;#39;s no way that</text>
  <text start="1680.91" dur="4.92">he knows how to fly a plane from a video</text>
  <text start="1683.25" dur="4.65">game because once you get into a real</text>
  <text start="1685.83" dur="3.99">plane it&amp;#39;s almost like saying oh I can</text>
  <text start="1687.9" dur="4.86">Bowl perfectly because I played on the</text>
  <text start="1689.82" dur="5.07">Wii and I use the Wii bowling and now</text>
  <text start="1692.76" dur="3.9">I&amp;#39;m an expert bowler now it doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="1694.89" dur="3.779">that way because when you start going to</text>
  <text start="1696.66" dur="5.009">the real lanes you realize it&amp;#39;s much</text>
  <text start="1698.669" dur="4.911">harder than it really is so we see right</text>
  <text start="1701.669" dur="4.681">now that something doesn&amp;#39;t seem right</text>
  <text start="1703.58" dur="6.37">and the plane was making maneuvers like</text>
  <text start="1706.35" dur="5.49">this was a seasoned pilot and it looks a</text>
  <text start="1709.95" dur="4.05">little you know it&amp;#39;s a little difficult</text>
  <text start="1711.84" dur="4.05">for an individual that never had flying</text>
  <text start="1714" dur="3.27">lessons who have never flown a plane to</text>
  <text start="1715.89" dur="3.27">these type of maneuvers and to</text>
  <text start="1717.27" dur="3.539">understand how to work everything in</text>
  <text start="1719.16" dur="3.99">this particular type of plane even if he</text>
  <text start="1720.809" dur="5.431">played a video game before it&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="1723.15" dur="4.89">same plane so we see that something is</text>
  <text start="1726.24" dur="4.05">really up with this and we can see that</text>
  <text start="1728.04" dur="5.22">you know from what he&amp;#39;s been doing here</text>
  <text start="1730.29" dur="5.28">and what has been said on the board with</text>
  <text start="1733.26" dur="3.99">Q it looks like this might have been a</text>
