  <text start="121.319" dur="2.91">for the people it might be betting</text>
  <text start="122.67" dur="5.88">getting better for the bankers the</text>
  <text start="124.229" dur="7.881">creditors and others who are on the top</text>
  <text start="128.55" dur="6.57">tier but for the people all they see is</text>
  <text start="132.11" dur="6.07">more and more of their hard-earned money</text>
  <text start="135.12" dur="6.51">leaving their pockets and they had a</text>
  <text start="138.18" dur="5.55">protest in Greece it was by farmers and</text>
  <text start="141.63" dur="5.219">we haven&amp;#39;t seen a protest like this and</text>
  <text start="143.73" dur="5.7">a couple years especially with the</text>
  <text start="146.849" dur="5.521">farmers and bus loads of men and women</text>
  <text start="149.43" dur="5.699">arrived across Greece to protest the</text>

  <text start="155.129" dur="5.851">security changes that the government</text>

  <text start="160.98" dur="5.519">threw oranges they threw you</text>
  <text start="164.069" dur="7.111">bottles and the police met them with</text>
  <text start="166.499" dur="7.83">tear gas sound cannons and it really got</text>
  <text start="171.18" dur="5.809">heated at one point and we can see many</text>
  <text start="174.329" dur="6.24">of the countries around the world</text>
  <text start="176.989" dur="6.22">they&amp;#39;re getting fed up with the private</text>
  <text start="180.569" dur="3.991">western central bank system and of</text>
  <text start="183.209" dur="3.78">course most of these governments are</text>
  <text start="184.56" dur="4.379">hooked into the system and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="186.989" dur="6.48">starting to see that as more and more</text>
  <text start="188.939" dur="7.711">people get taxed they&amp;#39;re becoming angry</text>
  <text start="193.469" dur="5.19">and this is why all the government&amp;#39;s at</text>
  <text start="196.65" dur="5.64">this point are preparing for something</text>
  <text start="198.659" dur="6.78">like this now we see out in Greece the</text>
  <text start="202.29" dur="7.19">situation is what we should all expect</text>
  <text start="205.439" dur="7.98">as we move down this road here because</text>
  <text start="209.48" dur="7.479">Greece really collapsed it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="213.419" dur="6.24">propped up with debt many of the people</text>
  <text start="216.959" dur="6.09">are not working a lot of the businesses</text>
  <text start="219.659" dur="7.17">have closed and assets of Greece are</text>
  <text start="223.049" dur="6.541">being sold off and we can see at this</text>
  <text start="226.829" dur="5.541">point that this will spread to more and</text>
  <text start="229.59" dur="5.009">more countries now the government</text>
  <text start="232.37" dur="4.38">officials or government employees they</text>
  <text start="234.599" dur="6.181">realize this is going to happen and</text>
  <text start="236.75" dur="6.689">they&amp;#39;re taking precautions to control</text>
  <text start="240.78" dur="5.94">the people now here in the States</text>
  <text start="243.439" dur="5.2">they&amp;#39;re keeping the illusion alive they</text>
  <text start="246.72" dur="4.199">need to keep the illusion alive until</text>
  <text start="248.639" dur="4.32">they get that special event where they</text>
  <text start="250.919" dur="5.37">can blame this on another group or</text>
  <text start="252.959" dur="5.071">country so here in the United States</text>
  <text start="256.289" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us that</text>
  <text start="258.03" dur="5.91">housing is fine retail is fine the stock</text>

  <text start="265.77" dur="4.05">little bit it drops a little bit but it</text>
  <text start="267.36" dur="5.19">looks like they&amp;#39;re keeping it stable at</text>
  <text start="269.82" dur="4.349">this point and of course way as we know</text>
  <text start="272.55" dur="3.45">they have the high-frequency traders the</text>
  <text start="274.169" dur="4.141">plunge protection team the free money</text>
  <text start="276" dur="6.63">from the Fed to pump into the market and</text>
  <text start="278.31" dur="8.01">keep this alive but we see that housing</text>
  <text start="282.63" dur="7.83">this is starting to completely implode</text>
  <text start="286.32" dur="7.529">on itself the bubble is now deflating a</text>
  <text start="290.46" dur="5.639">little bit it&amp;#39;s going to pop and we see</text>
  <text start="293.849" dur="4.201">that new and pending sales have tumbled</text>

  <text start="298.05" dur="6.54">are dropping dramatically home builder</text>
  <text start="300.69" dur="6.659">sentiment is starting to drop and now we</text>
  <text start="304.59" dur="5.669">see housing starts they have collapsed</text>
  <text start="307.349" dur="6.841">by eleven percent in October to the</text>
  <text start="310.259" dur="6.66">weakest level since March this is the</text>
  <text start="314.19" dur="5.819">biggest miss month-on-month sins</text>

  <text start="329.55" dur="5.549">point eight percent what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="332.909" dur="5.271">a collapse of the housing market at this</text>
  <text start="335.099" dur="5.79">point and there&amp;#39;s nothing they can do to</text>
  <text start="338.18" dur="4.87">keep and prop this up yes they can</text>
  <text start="340.889" dur="3.721">create the free money they can give it</text>
  <text start="343.05" dur="3.329">to the hedge funds investment companies</text>
  <text start="344.61" dur="3.989">to purchase homes but as more and more</text>
  <text start="346.379" dur="5.13">people decide you know something I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="348.599" dur="5.701">nervous about my job I know a lot of</text>
  <text start="351.509" dur="4.641">people that got laid off we hear more</text>
  <text start="354.3" dur="5.16">and more layoffs coming down the pike</text>
  <text start="356.15" dur="6.699">what they do is they say you know this</text>
  <text start="359.46" dur="6.209">is not a good time second of all I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="362.849" dur="6.031">have enough saved and these housing</text>
  <text start="365.669" dur="5.55">prices are still too high they yes they</text>
  <text start="368.88" dur="5.159">are coming down quite a bit it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="371.219" dur="5.82">harder and harder to sell a home I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="374.039" dur="8.341">seeing homes on the market now 180 a</text>
  <text start="377.039" dur="7.35">hundred and ninety days and they are</text>
  <text start="382.38" dur="3.87">continually dropping their prices now is</text>
  <text start="384.389" dur="6.09">this happening in every single location</text>
  <text start="386.25" dur="6.27">no but this is how it starts it starts</text>
  <text start="390.479" dur="5.55">in small little locations all around the</text>
  <text start="392.52" dur="4.649">country and it&amp;#39;s and it spreads and this</text>
  <text start="396.029" dur="3.781">is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now I</text>
  <text start="397.169" dur="5.61">remember back in two thousand eight when</text>
  <text start="399.81" dur="6">I lived in New York I saw housing prices</text>
  <text start="402.779" dur="4.741">coming down traffic drying up but other</text>
  <text start="405.81" dur="4.949">parts of the country were fine still and</text>
  <text start="407.52" dur="6.6">then six to eight months later it spread</text>
  <text start="410.759" dur="5.641">everywhere and actually those places</text>
  <text start="414.12" dur="5.69">where they said they were fine actually</text>
  <text start="416.4" dur="6.81">ended up being worse off now we know</text>
  <text start="419.81" dur="4.9">manufacturing is I mean just imploding</text>
  <text start="423.21" dur="4.379">on itself there&amp;#39;s no other word for this</text>
  <text start="424.71" dur="7.24">and we see that this is definitely going</text>
  <text start="427.589" dur="8.471">to affect retail and we know that</text>
  <text start="431.95" dur="5.94">all of this is happening because the</text>
  <text start="436.06" dur="5.1">people are losing jobs that people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="437.89" dur="5.64">have discretionary funds and whatever</text>
  <text start="441.16" dur="5.16">they have they&amp;#39;re keeping their nervous</text>
  <text start="443.53" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;re afraid the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="446.32" dur="7.29">right now which is kind of hard to</text>
  <text start="449.41" dur="6.87">manipulate and gives us a real indicator</text>
  <text start="453.61" dur="6.98">of what is happening with the global</text>
  <text start="456.28" dur="9.24">economy has now dropped to an all-time</text>
  <text start="460.59" dur="9.97">record low I mean it is absolutely awful</text>
  <text start="465.52" dur="7.8">we are down to 519 down another 18</text>
  <text start="470.56" dur="5.97">points and when we look back in time</text>
  <text start="473.32" dur="6.12">i&amp;#39;ll give you some examples here if we</text>
  <text start="476.53" dur="7.98">go back to 2005 the average bolted dry</text>
  <text start="479.44" dur="10.26">index was around 3000 2006 it was around</text>
  <text start="484.51" dur="10.41">4000 2007 the year right before the</text>
  <text start="489.7" dur="10.02">major collapse in the Great Recession we</text>
  <text start="494.92" dur="9.8">hit 11,000 and then 2008 came and the</text>
  <text start="499.72" dur="10.05">average was about six hundred or so and</text>
  <text start="504.72" dur="9.25">basically by the Fed creating free money</text>
  <text start="509.77" dur="6.48">through the QE programs they were able</text>
  <text start="513.97" dur="4.83">to pump all of this up the real estate</text>
  <text start="516.25" dur="5.51">market and everything else and the</text>
  <text start="518.8" dur="5.49">Baltic Dry Index rose to about 4,100 and</text>
  <text start="521.76" dur="4.96">then ever since then we have been</text>
  <text start="524.29" dur="9.03">declining last year the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="526.72" dur="10.49">the average was around 1,100 the year</text>
  <text start="533.32" dur="7.17">before that it was like 1300 right now</text>
  <text start="537.21" dur="8.85">we are continually falling during this</text>
  <text start="540.49" dur="9.89">time of year this is absolutely awful</text>
  <text start="546.06" dur="8.5">this shows us that the global economy</text>
  <text start="550.38" dur="7.57">it&amp;#39;s not recovering at all it shows us</text>
  <text start="554.56" dur="6.24">there is something wrong it&amp;#39;s either the</text>
  <text start="557.95" dur="6.33">government is lying about everything</text>
  <text start="560.8" dur="4.529">they&amp;#39;re telling us or all this</text>
  <text start="564.28" dur="3.45">information is</text>
  <text start="565.329" dur="4.56">completely wrong now I&amp;#39;m going to go</text>
  <text start="567.73" dur="4.229">with the government is lying because</text>
  <text start="569.889" dur="5.76">it&amp;#39;s very hard to manipulate the</text>
  <text start="571.959" dur="6.36">shipment of raw material it&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="575.649" dur="4.65">easier to manipulate the unemployment</text>
  <text start="578.319" dur="4.08">numbers and say okay listen you see</text>
  <text start="580.299" dur="3.63">these 500,000 people we&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="582.399" dur="2.97">going to count them because they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="583.929" dur="3.32">looking for a job so we&amp;#39;ll just drop the</text>
  <text start="585.369" dur="5.76">unemployment now down to five percent</text>
  <text start="587.249" dur="5.861">it&amp;#39;s a lot easier to do that it&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="591.129" dur="5.281">easier to manipulate GDP it&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="593.11" dur="5.759">easier to manipulate inflation and we</text>
  <text start="596.41" dur="4.919">can see the government is trying to keep</text>
  <text start="598.869" dur="7.351">this illusion alive trying to pretend</text>
  <text start="601.329" dur="7.651">that everything is fine now it seems</text>
  <text start="606.22" dur="5.579">that the police at this point through</text>
  <text start="608.98" dur="5.81">their civil asset forfeiture they have</text>
  <text start="611.799" dur="6.54">exceeded the value of all burglaries in</text>
  <text start="614.79" dur="6.279">2014 between nineteen eighty nine and</text>
  <text start="618.339" dur="4.53">twenty ten US Attorney seized an</text>
  <text start="621.069" dur="5.31">estimated twelve point six billion in</text>
  <text start="622.869" dur="5.16">asset forfeiture cases the growth rate</text>
  <text start="626.379" dur="5.731">during that time was about nineteen</text>
  <text start="628.029" dur="7.321">percent in 2010 alone the value of</text>
  <text start="632.11" dur="6.659">assets grew by fifty two percent from</text>
  <text start="635.35" dur="9.239">2009 and was six times greater than the</text>
  <text start="638.769" dur="10.141">total for 1989 then by 2014 that number</text>
  <text start="644.589" dur="7.261">ballooned to about 4.5 billion for the</text>
  <text start="648.91" dur="4.709">year making this thirty-five percent of</text>
  <text start="651.85" dur="3.69">the entire number of assets collected</text>
  <text start="653.619" dur="6.93">from nineteen eighty nine to twenty ten</text>
  <text start="655.54" dur="7.649">in a single year now according to the</text>
  <text start="660.549" dur="8.1">FBI the total amount of goods stolen by</text>
  <text start="663.189" dur="8.82">criminals in 2014 burglary offenses was</text>
  <text start="668.649" dur="5.641">estimated around 3.9 billion so this</text>
  <text start="672.009" dur="6.091">means the police are now taking more</text>
  <text start="674.29" dur="9.359">assets than the criminals I mean</text>
  <text start="678.1" dur="8.699">remember when they take your money they</text>
  <text start="683.649" dur="6.48">take your property they don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="686.799" dur="6.47">prove anything they don&amp;#39;t have to prove</text>
  <text start="690.129" dur="6.15">a single thing they can just take it and</text>
  <text start="693.269" dur="5.711">they don&amp;#39;t have to return it this is the</text>
  <text start="696.279" dur="8.36">best crime</text>
  <text start="698.98" dur="9.21">scam I have ever seen and it&amp;#39;s legal</text>
  <text start="704.639" dur="4.81">that&amp;#39;s what makes it perfect and the</text>
  <text start="708.19" dur="2.639">criminals they should become police</text>
  <text start="709.449" dur="3.33">officers then they can get all the stuff</text>
  <text start="710.829" dur="7.62">they want because that&amp;#39;s exactly what</text>
  <text start="712.779" dur="7.92">the police are doing now we realize that</text>
  <text start="718.449" dur="5.041">the government they&amp;#39;re having a tougher</text>
  <text start="720.699" dur="5.64">and tougher time trying to collect</text>
  <text start="723.49" dur="4.26">revenue from the people this is why</text>
  <text start="726.339" dur="6.261">they&amp;#39;re keeping the interest rates very</text>
  <text start="727.75" dur="8.399">very low this is why they created and a</text>
  <text start="732.6" dur="6.039">printed money to prop up the economy</text>
  <text start="736.149" dur="4.591">this is why they created laws like FATCA</text>

  <text start="744.61" dur="4.83">high if interest rates went up it would</text>
  <text start="746.769" dur="5.491">be a complete disaster so now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="749.44" dur="3.87">trying something else and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="752.26" dur="3.449">to keep trying all these different</text>
  <text start="753.31" dur="6.029">things and put pressure on the people</text>

  <text start="759.339" dur="5.671">they&amp;#39;re tapped out people are losing</text>
  <text start="762.04" dur="7.789">jobs I mean think about this for a</text>

  <text start="802.24" dur="6.17">live to pay whatever bills you have to</text>
  <text start="804.699" dur="7.2">pay but the IRS they want their money</text>
  <text start="808.41" dur="7.119">now you don&amp;#39;t have any money to give but</text>
  <text start="811.899" dur="6.93">the government the central bank doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="815.529" dur="5.37">care and they think that you&amp;#39;re hiding</text>
  <text start="818.829" dur="6.63">it someplace that you&amp;#39;re doing something</text>
  <text start="820.899" dur="6.56">tricky to not pay them so right now if</text>
  <text start="825.459" dur="5.37">you owe the Internal Revenue Service</text>
  <text start="827.459" dur="5.321">more than 50,000 and it always starts</text>
  <text start="830.829" dur="3.811">out high so everyone goes yes though</text>
  <text start="832.78" dur="3.69">people making a lot of money they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="834.64" dur="4.71">ones who are going to have to pay well</text>
  <text start="836.47" dur="6.84">if you&amp;#39;re making more than 50,000 I mean</text>
  <text start="839.35" dur="7.26">if you owe more than 50,000 in taxes you</text>
  <text start="843.31" dur="6.39">could soon have your US passport taken</text>
  <text start="846.61" dur="4.92">away now they&amp;#39;re starting out at this</text>
  <text start="849.7" dur="4.08">high number so everyone says okay poof I</text>
  <text start="851.53" dur="4.29">only know three thousand I don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="853.78" dur="5.1">worry about this at this point but you</text>
  <text start="855.82" dur="5.7">know what happens this is how they start</text>
  <text start="858.88" dur="4.98">they start off very high and they say</text>
  <text start="861.52" dur="4.14">okay everyone with 25,000 everyone that</text>
  <text start="863.86" dur="6.15">I was fifteen thousand and then finally</text>
  <text start="865.66" dur="6.39">if you just owe taxes guess what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="870.01" dur="3.24">going to take your passport away you</text>
  <text start="872.05" dur="5.43">will not be able to leave this country</text>
  <text start="873.25" dur="7.71">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that this</text>
  <text start="877.48" dur="6">passport measure will raise about their</text>
  <text start="880.96" dur="6.81">estimating about 400 million over ten</text>
  <text start="883.48" dur="6.69">years I mean this doesn&amp;#39;t do anything to</text>
  <text start="887.77" dur="3.87">the debt whatsoever so there there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="890.17" dur="5.31">different agenda behind this and also</text>
  <text start="891.64" dur="7.65">what about all those people living</text>
  <text start="895.48" dur="9.87">abroad working outside the country that</text>
  <text start="899.29" dur="7.68">Oh more than 50,000 in taxes and maybe</text>
  <text start="905.35" dur="4.65">they don&amp;#39;t have it maybe it&amp;#39;s over a</text>
  <text start="906.97" dur="6.54">certain period of time will their</text>
  <text start="910" dur="5.76">passports be revoked and what happens to</text>
  <text start="913.51" dur="7.11">those people who are living in different</text>
  <text start="915.76" dur="8.22">countries so this is very interesting</text>
  <text start="920.62" dur="4.89">they tried faka they tried Obamacare now</text>
  <text start="923.98" dur="2.76">they want to revoke your passport</text>
  <text start="925.51" dur="6.59">because they think you&amp;#39;re hiding money</text>
  <text start="926.74" dur="7.59">someplace and we know the IMF put out a</text>
  <text start="932.1" dur="3.61">generalized tax of about ten percent</text>
  <text start="934.33" dur="3.3">where they&amp;#39;re saying let&amp;#39;s take</text>
  <text start="935.71" dur="3.93">everyone&amp;#39;s wealth and we&amp;#39;ll charge them</text>
  <text start="937.63" dur="4.56">ten percent of course they want to use</text>
  <text start="939.64" dur="5.13">this to pay off the private wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="942.19" dur="8.6">central bank debts that the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="944.77" dur="8.22">oh and they&amp;#39;re trying the carbon tax if</text>
  <text start="950.79" dur="5.26">we tell everyone they&amp;#39;re ruining the</text>
  <text start="952.99" dur="4.23">environment we can go ahead and tax the</text>
  <text start="956.05" dur="2.73">people of course they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="957.22" dur="4.11">use the money for anything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="958.78" dur="4.5">related to the environment because the</text>
  <text start="961.33" dur="5.4">IMF Director Christine Lagarde already</text>
  <text start="963.28" dur="6.45">said this would be a perfect time</text>
  <text start="966.73" dur="6.9">to basically tax everyone through carbon</text>
  <text start="969.73" dur="7.01">to pay off this monstrous debt around</text>
  <text start="973.63" dur="7.829">the world and this is how we know that</text>
  <text start="976.74" dur="8.62">this whole entire plan everything that</text>
  <text start="981.459" dur="6.781">they&amp;#39;re doing at this point it&amp;#39;s to pay</text>
  <text start="985.36" dur="6.479">off this debt because this system is</text>
  <text start="988.24" dur="6.149">collapsing it will not survive and they</text>
  <text start="991.839" dur="4.261">know this and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="994.389" dur="6.69">looking to get as much as they possibly</text>
  <text start="996.1" dur="6.57">can before this system crashes listen</text>
  <text start="1001.079" dur="3.931">everyone thanks a lot for listening be</text>
  <text start="1002.67" dur="4.94">well be safe and especially be prepared</text>
