  <text start="49.92" dur="5.849">the donations let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="52.62" dur="6.39">economic collapse news now a couple</text>
  <text start="55.769" dur="7.38">reports ago we talked about DHS having</text>
  <text start="59.01" dur="6.17">this hands-off terror list and we</text>
  <text start="63.149" dur="5.371">understand that Senator Charles Grassley</text>
  <text start="65.18" dur="7.21">is investigating this and what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="68.52" dur="6.68">turning up is that the certain names on</text>
  <text start="72.39" dur="6.33">the hands off list are being deleted</text>
  <text start="75.2" dur="6.309">mysteriously and they&amp;#39;re asking jay</text>
  <text start="78.72" dur="6.81">johnson why are these names being</text>
  <text start="81.509" dur="5.97">deleted off of this list and they are</text>
  <text start="85.53" dur="4.14">looking back further when Janet</text>
  <text start="87.479" dur="5.731">Napolitano was in charge of the DHS and</text>
  <text start="89.67" dur="6.269">it looks like she was also wiping the</text>
  <text start="93.21" dur="5.61">records of the hands off list of certain</text>
  <text start="95.939" dur="5.61">individuals that they didn&amp;#39;t want anyone</text>
  <text start="98.82" dur="6.36">to know about so this is very</text>
  <text start="101.549" dur="6.541">interesting that they don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="105.18" dur="4.71">senator to see certain people on the</text>
  <text start="108.09" dur="4.5">list are these people going to be</text>
  <text start="109.89" dur="5.909">designated and are going to be used to</text>
  <text start="112.59" dur="6.12">carry out the next event I mean why are</text>
  <text start="115.799" dur="7.021">they doing this are they being paid are</text>
  <text start="118.71" dur="6.479">they in the back pockets of the agencies</text>
  <text start="122.82" dur="5.46">of the United States to carry out</text>
  <text start="125.189" dur="5.311">something and we&amp;#39;ll have to hear and see</text>
  <text start="128.28" dur="5.34">later about what&amp;#39;s going on there now</text>
  <text start="130.5" dur="6.12">down in Nigeria we understand this whole</text>
  <text start="133.62" dur="5.64">entire propaganda of the girls being</text>
  <text start="136.62" dur="4.35">kidnapped in Nigeria</text>
  <text start="139.26" dur="3.059">and what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="140.97" dur="4.829">trying to create that link between</text>
  <text start="142.319" dur="7.59">al-qaeda and Boko Haram and right now</text>
  <text start="145.799" dur="7.201">today Saturday the president of Nigeria</text>
  <text start="149.909" dur="5.851">was out there saying that the Nigerian</text>
  <text start="153" dur="4.89">Islamist militant group Boko Haram is no</text>
  <text start="155.76" dur="6.03">longer a local threat but has become a</text>
  <text start="157.89" dur="6.83">West Africa&amp;#39;s al-qaida Boko Haram is no</text>
  <text start="161.79" dur="6.18">longer a local terrorist group it is now</text>
  <text start="164.72" dur="4.989">international and this is the way the</text>
  <text start="167.97" dur="4.2">United States is going to say see we</text>
  <text start="169.709" dur="5.101">need to get into this area we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="172.17" dur="5.52">to see other events occur there this</text>
  <text start="174.81" dur="5.91">group will expand just like in Kenya</text>
  <text start="177.69" dur="5.579">with the al-shabaab terrorists this is</text>
  <text start="180.72" dur="3.96">the way the United States can say okay</text>
  <text start="183.269" dur="3.75">its international terrorists let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="184.68" dur="5.04">into Nigeria we can start bringing</text>
  <text start="187.019" dur="4.741">forces down into the region and this is</text>
  <text start="189.72" dur="4.47">exactly what they&amp;#39;re trying to do at</text>
  <text start="191.76" dur="5.699">this point now we understand that the</text>
  <text start="194.19" dur="7.139">United States has the controls the</text>
  <text start="197.459" dur="6.84">Panama Canal and Russia right now is</text>
  <text start="201.329" dur="6.75">building their own canal in Nicaragua</text>
  <text start="204.299" dur="5.041">and Moscow and Managua are to cooperate</text>
  <text start="208.079" dur="3.02">over the next few years on the</text>
  <text start="209.34" dur="4.769">construction of the so-called</text>
  <text start="211.099" dur="5.741">interoceanic grand canal a new</text>
  <text start="214.109" dur="4.891">alternative to the Panama Canal it will</text>
  <text start="216.84" dur="4.619">be deeper and wider and longer than its</text>
  <text start="219" dur="5.15">rival in Panama the new canal will</text>
  <text start="221.459" dur="5.46">challenge us control over the region</text>
  <text start="224.15" dur="4.989">though experts are divided on a Jew</text>
  <text start="226.919" dur="6.481">political benefits for Russia the main</text>
  <text start="229.139" dur="7.111">investor is a Chinese company HK &amp;amp; D</text>
  <text start="233.4" dur="4.979">which has received a 100-year concession</text>
  <text start="236.25" dur="4.109">for building and operating this canal</text>
  <text start="238.379" dur="4.351">the construction will be carried out by</text>
  <text start="240.359" dur="4.111">works from China and Russia so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="242.73" dur="4.219">going to have the Panama Canal and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="244.47" dur="5.099">going to have the Nicaragua canal and</text>
  <text start="246.949" dur="5.44">we&amp;#39;re going to see that Russia and China</text>
  <text start="249.569" dur="4.711">will maintain control of this canal so</text>
  <text start="252.389" dur="7.051">they can get ships moving back and forth</text>
  <text start="254.28" dur="8.1">in the region now we understand the Thai</text>
  <text start="259.44" dur="5.699">government in Thailand is a puppet</text>
  <text start="262.38" dur="5.46">regime of the United States and every</text>
  <text start="265.139" dur="5.071">time we see these puppet regimes they</text>
  <text start="267.84" dur="4.86">always seem to forget about the people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="270.21" dur="5.31">rights they forget about democracy</text>
  <text start="272.7" dur="5.49">they come down hard on these people and</text>
  <text start="275.52" dur="5.73">in every place we see they usually end</text>
  <text start="278.19" dur="5.97">up calling them terrorists and in</text>
  <text start="281.25" dur="5.46">Thailand right now what is happening is</text>
  <text start="284.16" dur="4.5">that these people are rising up people</text>
  <text start="286.71" dur="4.95">are saying they do not agree with this</text>
  <text start="288.66" dur="5.61">government there and right now the army</text>
  <text start="291.66" dur="4.77">has threatened to declare martial law if</text>
  <text start="294.27" dur="4.83">widespread violence breaks out in</text>
  <text start="296.43" dur="4.5">Thailand anti-government protest camp</text>
  <text start="299.1" dur="4.44">sites have been the target of numerous</text>
  <text start="300.93" dur="4.56">attacks from unidentified assailants in</text>
  <text start="303.54" dur="4.23">recent weeks the latest incident killed</text>
  <text start="305.49" dur="6.12">three demonstrators and injured at least</text>
  <text start="307.77" dur="6.09">20 now if martial law is invoked it</text>
  <text start="311.61" dur="5.07">would grant the military superior power</text>
  <text start="313.86" dur="4.83">over the civil authority it matters a</text>
  <text start="316.68" dur="4.89">maintaining public order it would permit</text>
  <text start="318.69" dur="6.63">the military to censor the many media</text>
  <text start="321.57" dur="6.21">announced a curfew and burn any house or</text>
  <text start="325.32" dur="5.04">thing which may be useful to the enemy</text>
  <text start="327.78" dur="4.86">so you can see this really sounds pretty</text>
  <text start="330.36" dur="4.02">much like what they&amp;#39;re doing in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="332.64" dur="4.77">what they&amp;#39;re doing in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="334.38" dur="6.12">and here we are in Thailand they would</text>
  <text start="337.41" dur="4.89">want nothing better but to declare</text>
  <text start="340.5" dur="4.41">martial law because will make it much</text>
  <text start="342.3" dur="4.47">easier to come down on the people who</text>
  <text start="344.91" dur="4.02">are looking to oust the government in</text>
  <text start="346.77" dur="3.69">that country and again if we look in the</text>
  <text start="348.93" dur="4.05">Middle East we&amp;#39;re seeing the same exact</text>
  <text start="350.46" dur="3.96">thing people are rising up and of course</text>
  <text start="352.98" dur="4.08">the United States calls them al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="354.42" dur="4.71">terrorists but these people want</text>
  <text start="357.06" dur="4.17">democracy freedom they want the private</text>
  <text start="359.13" dur="4.23">western central bank out of their</text>
  <text start="361.23" dur="4.11">country they want the United States out</text>
  <text start="363.36" dur="4.02">of their country and they want to take</text>
  <text start="365.34" dur="4.23">control of their country and they want</text>
  <text start="367.38" dur="5.19">it back and we see this happening in</text>
  <text start="369.57" dur="5.82">Thailand right now and these people are</text>
  <text start="372.57" dur="6.66">going to be pushed and controlled down</text>
  <text start="375.39" dur="7.29">by martial law if they do impose it now</text>
  <text start="379.23" dur="6.21">in Ukraine what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="382.68" dur="5.73">is Donetsk the region is going to ignore</text>
  <text start="385.44" dur="4.26">the presidential elections in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="388.41" dur="3.42">because they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re not part</text>
  <text start="389.7" dur="6.12">of it whatsoever and there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="391.83" dur="6.12">for them to even you know a care about</text>
  <text start="395.82" dur="4.59">it the self-proclaimed Donetsk People&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="397.95" dur="3.95">Republic won&amp;#39;t participate in the</text>
  <text start="400.41" dur="3.72">election of the Ukrainians president</text>
  <text start="401.9" dur="4.12">ukrainian President on May twenty-fifth</text>
  <text start="404.13" dur="2.39">says the new prime minister of the</text>
  <text start="406.02" dur="2.269">breakaway</text>
  <text start="406.52" dur="3.81">region there won&amp;#39;t be any presidential</text>
  <text start="408.289" dur="5.94">elections on the territory of the</text>
  <text start="410.33" dur="5.64">Republic now they&amp;#39;re also since they</text>
  <text start="414.229" dur="4.771">broke away their autonomous and they</text>
  <text start="415.97" dur="5.419">seceded from Kiev Ukraine they are</text>
  <text start="419" dur="4.949">looking to create and adopt their own</text>
  <text start="421.389" dur="4.511">constitution they&amp;#39;re saying a sovereign</text>
  <text start="423.949" dur="4.201">nation needs their own constitution so</text>
  <text start="425.9" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re creating their own constitution</text>
  <text start="428.15" dur="5.46">and of course as we know Ukraine does</text>
  <text start="431" dur="4.139">not like this whatsoever at this is why</text>
  <text start="433.61" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re intensifying their</text>
  <text start="435.139" dur="5.391">anti-terrorism forces the 24-hour period</text>
  <text start="438.08" dur="4.709">is up they are continually asking the</text>
  <text start="440.53" dur="4.81">anti-terrorism forces to remove</text>
  <text start="442.789" dur="6.87">themselves from the Donetsk region and</text>
  <text start="445.34" dur="9.21">as so far they have not so we might see</text>
  <text start="449.659" dur="6.63">some type of skirmish start up someplace</text>
  <text start="454.55" dur="3.989">because now we&amp;#39;re past the deadline</text>
  <text start="456.289" dur="4.771">they&amp;#39;re continually asked them to remove</text>
  <text start="458.539" dur="6.391">themselves and they have not done this</text>
  <text start="461.06" dur="5.88">so far now a couple reports ago we</text>
  <text start="464.93" dur="6.479">talked about how we understand how the</text>
  <text start="466.94" dur="6.9">FBI the CIA and NATO is in Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="471.409" dur="4.921">we have to understand Ukraine is not</text>
  <text start="473.84" dur="5.28">part of NATO so there&amp;#39;s no reason for</text>
  <text start="476.33" dur="5.369">NATO to be in there whatsoever but of</text>
  <text start="479.12" dur="4.169">course the puppet government in Kiev is</text>
  <text start="481.699" dur="4.321">controlled by the United States</text>
  <text start="483.289" dur="4.651">government the central bankers and of</text>
  <text start="486.02" dur="4.11">course NATO is going to be in there and</text>
  <text start="487.94" dur="5.43">of course NATO&amp;#39;s excuse they&amp;#39;re in there</text>
  <text start="490.13" dur="6.42">to protect the nuclear facilities to</text>
  <text start="493.37" dur="6.12">help them with security and we have to</text>
  <text start="496.55" dur="4.38">think about this why are they saying</text>
  <text start="499.49" dur="4.28">this and there&amp;#39;s a new report at a</text>
  <text start="500.93" dur="5.639">global research and they&amp;#39;re stating that</text>
  <text start="503.77" dur="5.41">about 20 members from the armed at neo</text>
  <text start="506.569" dur="5.52">Nazi front right sector attempted to</text>
  <text start="509.18" dur="4.68">storm the nuclear power plant so you can</text>
  <text start="512.089" dur="3.901">see how they&amp;#39;re creating this false flag</text>
  <text start="513.86" dur="5.669">event like something is going to happen</text>
  <text start="515.99" dur="6.539">they&amp;#39;re going to have this group storm</text>
  <text start="519.529" dur="5.881">the area and say oh my god these nuclear</text>
  <text start="522.529" dur="4.62">power plants are not secure and how</text>
  <text start="525.41" dur="4.02">would this help the United States</text>
  <text start="527.149" dur="5.761">central bankers and NATO well of course</text>
  <text start="529.43" dur="5.48">if they did this NATO would have the</text>
  <text start="532.91" dur="5.25">excuse of bringing in troops into</text>
  <text start="534.91" dur="5.349">Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="538.16" dur="4.89">we can see what is happening they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="540.259" dur="6.031">using the security and the safety and</text>
  <text start="543.05" dur="5.339">this is why NATO is helping out and as</text>
  <text start="546.29" dur="6.359">soon as they have some type of an event</text>
  <text start="548.389" dur="6.781">occur where that looks like this another</text>
  <text start="552.649" dur="5.19">group has stormed and taken one of the</text>
  <text start="555.17" dur="5.13">nuclear power plants they can make the</text>
  <text start="557.839" dur="5.37">case that okay this is getting out of</text>
  <text start="560.3" dur="5.519">hand this could go nuclear and we really</text>
  <text start="563.209" dur="4.98">need to bring in NATO troops and we can</text>
  <text start="565.819" dur="4.89">see how they&amp;#39;re continually pushing all</text>
  <text start="568.189" dur="6.531">these little mini Falls flags to provoke</text>
  <text start="570.709" dur="7.05">provoke provoke and bring in troops and</text>
  <text start="574.72" dur="4.57">try to get this war started and so far</text>
  <text start="577.759" dur="3.961">it has failed every time I mean they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="579.29" dur="4.849">killed a lot of people but they cannot</text>
  <text start="581.72" dur="6.239">provoke Russia into doing something and</text>
  <text start="584.139" dur="5.74">the regions are having referendums</text>
  <text start="587.959" dur="4.651">they&amp;#39;re breaking away from Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="589.879" dur="5.551">we can see the situation is really at a</text>
  <text start="592.61" dur="5.279">tipping point at this time because one</text>
  <text start="595.43" dur="5.61">little flash point one little hiccup</text>
  <text start="597.889" dur="5.971">could really start an all-out civil war</text>
  <text start="601.04" dur="5.43">in Ukraine and of course this would then</text>
  <text start="603.86" dur="6.51">spread nations would get involved like</text>
  <text start="606.47" dur="5.369">United States nato russia would start</text>
  <text start="610.37" dur="4.199">getting involved it would spread the</text>
  <text start="611.839" dur="5.131">china and we can see how this can could</text>
  <text start="614.569" dur="5.281">get completely out of hand now the</text>
  <text start="616.97" dur="5.039">people in libya are really fighting to</text>
  <text start="619.85" dur="4.739">take back their country they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>

  <text start="768.32" dur="4.89">status at this time and we understand</text>
  <text start="771.62" dur="5.13">that carrie has been meeting with all</text>
  <text start="773.21" dur="7.14">other nations and the reason why they</text>
  <text start="776.75" dur="7.91">gave the Syrian opposition diplomatic</text>
  <text start="780.35" dur="7.32">status was to lobby heavily for</text>
  <text start="784.66" dur="5.02">increased weapons shipments so we can</text>

  <text start="806.84" dur="4.65">troops they are getting ready to do one</text>
  <text start="809.33" dur="4.8">or two things they&amp;#39;re going to have an</text>
  <text start="811.49" dur="4.92">event around the world to say look what</text>
  <text start="814.13" dur="4.35">Assad has been doing or they&amp;#39;ll make an</text>
  <text start="816.41" dur="5.25">assassination attempt and they&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="818.48" dur="6.27">go right in with a mission of some other</text>
  <text start="821.66" dur="5.73">sort to get into Syria but we understand</text>
  <text start="824.75" dur="5.16">that they will not give up they will</text>
  <text start="827.39" dur="5.79">continue continually push their agenda</text>
  <text start="829.91" dur="5.58">forward because they realize and we all</text>
  <text start="833.18" dur="6.57">understand this that they only want one</text>
  <text start="835.49" dur="7.53">thing their goal is to remove Assad from</text>
  <text start="839.75" dur="5.43">power that is it there is nothing else</text>
  <text start="843.02" dur="4.08">they want more because this will give</text>
  <text start="845.18" dur="4.86">them the ability then to go into Iran</text>

  <text start="853.1" dur="4.44">or they need help Iran would come to</text>
  <text start="855.59" dur="4.89">their aid and then we also know that</text>
  <text start="857.54" dur="5.79">China and Russia are backing Iran and</text>
  <text start="860.48" dur="4.98">Syria and of course that would bring in</text>
  <text start="863.33" dur="4.71">Russia and Syria and then the United</text>
  <text start="865.46" dur="6.63">States would get involved fully with all</text>
  <text start="868.04" dur="6.33">the other NATO nations and then the</text>
  <text start="872.09" dur="4.95">start the the fighting starts so we can</text>

  <text start="877.04" dur="4.68">is happening all over and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="878.75" dur="5.31">pushing the agenda faster and faster</text>
  <text start="881.72" dur="4.11">because they understand they are in a</text>
  <text start="884.06" dur="4.8">time crunch at this time we understand</text>
