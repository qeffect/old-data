  <text start="33.82" dur="4.559">report my name is dave and this is</text>
  <text start="35.26" dur="6.47">episode 955 a and today&amp;#39;s date is april</text>
  <text start="38.379" dur="5.07">20 6 2016 and the title the episode is</text>
  <text start="41.73" dur="3.849">confidence in the government is</text>
  <text start="43.449" dur="5.341">declining economic indicators show the</text>
  <text start="45.579" dur="6.151">economy is finished let&amp;#39;s get right into</text>
  <text start="48.79" dur="5.01">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="51.73" dur="3.63">all the indicators that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="53.8" dur="5.279">looking at all the economic indicators</text>
  <text start="55.36" dur="5.219">they&amp;#39;ve been slowly declining and every</text>
  <text start="59.079" dur="3.87">day it&amp;#39;s getting worse and worse and</text>
  <text start="60.579" dur="5.191">worse it&amp;#39;s not improving yes we do have</text>
  <text start="62.949" dur="5.701">the little dead cat bounce but it drops</text>
  <text start="65.77" dur="5.31">right back down and we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="68.65" dur="5.43">over consecutive months things do not</text>
  <text start="71.08" dur="4.8">look good now the government they have</text>
  <text start="74.08" dur="3.96">the conference board which they fund</text>
  <text start="75.88" dur="5.309">this shows consumer confidence and</text>
  <text start="78.04" dur="5.1">usually this is completely the opposite</text>
  <text start="81.189" dur="4.081">of what the gallup poll shows which is</text>
  <text start="83.14" dur="3.93">the gallup poll is the people&amp;#39;s poll</text>
  <text start="85.27" dur="4.62">where they go out and they do a survey</text>
  <text start="87.07" dur="5.7">amongst the people and you know once the</text>
  <text start="89.89" dur="4.82">conference board starts declining we are</text>
  <text start="92.77" dur="4.29">in big trouble because that means</text>
  <text start="94.71" dur="4.78">they&amp;#39;re losing control of the narrative</text>
  <text start="97.06" dur="4.68">and there&amp;#39;s no way to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="99.49" dur="6.479">that everything is still fine so right</text>
  <text start="101.74" dur="8.07">now the cop the conference board they</text>
  <text start="105.969" dur="9.39">were expecting 95.8 and that has dropped</text>
  <text start="109.81" dur="9.57">to 94.2 and this is the lowest in two</text>
  <text start="115.359" dur="8.12">years right now and the conference board</text>
  <text start="119.38" dur="8.129">is saying that they are not seeing any</text>
  <text start="123.479" dur="7.741">type of pick up in the momentum of</text>
  <text start="127.509" dur="7.651">consumers any time in the near future</text>
  <text start="131.22" dur="7.96">now if we look at the gallup poll well</text>
  <text start="135.16" dur="5.61">this is even worse and it confirms the</text>
  <text start="139.18" dur="4.529">conference board which is funded by the</text>
  <text start="140.77" dur="5.689">government well actually it should be</text>
  <text start="143.709" dur="5.011">the other way around the gallup poll is</text>
  <text start="146.459" dur="5.891">the true measure because they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="148.72" dur="8.31">out for the people and now the funded</text>
  <text start="152.35" dur="8.01">conference board is confirming gallops</text>
  <text start="157.03" dur="7.44">poll and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="160.36" dur="8.94">that the gallup poll is at</text>
  <text start="164.47" dur="7.68">eight month lows and it is dropped from</text>
  <text start="169.3" dur="7.41">negative 12 all the way down to negative</text>
  <text start="172.15" dur="8.55">16 and this was a four point drop and</text>
  <text start="176.71" dur="7.5">the last time the score was lower was</text>
  <text start="180.7" dur="5.21">August 2015 and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="184.21" dur="5.12">that this is continually declining</text>
  <text start="185.91" dur="7.72">people are not confident whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="189.33" dur="6.1">things are rapidly falling apart now</text>
  <text start="193.63" dur="3.54">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="195.43" dur="4.05">government is continually trying to</text>
  <text start="197.17" dur="5.37">convince us that employment is still</text>
  <text start="199.48" dur="5.85">good and what we&amp;#39;ve been showing is that</text>
  <text start="202.54" dur="4.68">their employment numbers don&amp;#39;t make any</text>
  <text start="205.33" dur="3.69">sense I mean yesterday we talked about</text>
  <text start="207.22" dur="4.83">credit credit Swiss and we talked about</text>
  <text start="209.02" dur="5.76">the retail numbers how there&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="212.05" dur="5.61">amount of layoffs and we see there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="214.78" dur="5.22">study where we&amp;#39;re looking from nineteen</text>
  <text start="217.66" dur="5.04">eighty five to two thousand and we see</text>
  <text start="220" dur="4.95">that there were employment gains and we</text>
  <text start="222.7" dur="4.259">see during the same time we saw wages go</text>
  <text start="224.95" dur="4.8">up and we saw the economic growth</text>
  <text start="226.959" dur="7.101">continually move up now if we look at</text>
  <text start="229.75" dur="7.739">2000 of 2016 we see the opposite happen</text>
  <text start="234.06" dur="6.37">now if employment is growing at the</text>
  <text start="237.489" dur="5.821">fastest pace since 1990 then wage growth</text>
  <text start="240.43" dur="5.79">and by extension economic growth should</text>
  <text start="243.31" dur="5.06">be much stronger than what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="246.22" dur="6.06">right now so of course something&amp;#39;s wrong</text>
  <text start="248.37" dur="6.1">so if we are truly experiencing this</text>
  <text start="252.28" dur="5.16">strongest streak of employment growth</text>
  <text start="254.47" dur="5.82">since the 90s should we not be</text>
  <text start="257.44" dur="5.97">witnessing the following we should be</text>
  <text start="260.29" dur="4.5">seeing a surge in wage growth because we</text>
  <text start="263.41" dur="4.59">know the unemployment is around five</text>
  <text start="264.79" dur="6.689">percent and this would give employees is</text>
  <text start="268" dur="7.35">we give the everyday consumer pricing</text>
  <text start="271.479" dur="7.171">power we should see economic growth well</text>
  <text start="275.35" dur="5.25">above three percent because the five</text>
  <text start="278.65" dur="6.24">percent unemployment leads to stronger</text>
  <text start="280.6" dur="6.56">consumption arise in imports as rising</text>
  <text start="284.89" dur="5.55">consumption leads to demand for goods</text>
  <text start="287.16" dur="6.43">falling inventories as sales outpaced</text>
  <text start="290.44" dur="6.26">production rising industrial production</text>
  <text start="293.59" dur="4.59">as demand for goods increasing increases</text>
  <text start="296.7" dur="6.189">we should be</text>
  <text start="298.18" dur="8.31">seeing all of this but we don&amp;#39;t now very</text>
  <text start="302.889" dur="7.321">interestingly between april 2003 until</text>
  <text start="306.49" dur="5.91">august 2005 we saw unemployment</text>
  <text start="310.21" dur="6.989">continually dropping we saw economic</text>
  <text start="312.4" dur="9.03">growth retail sales accelerated and it</text>
  <text start="317.199" dur="7.171">all made sense then we come to now the</text>
  <text start="321.43" dur="5.73">presence where we have the unemployment</text>
  <text start="324.37" dur="5.13">very low they&amp;#39;re telling us everyone is</text>
  <text start="327.16" dur="5.759">working and we see the opposite</text>
  <text start="329.5" dur="6.33">happening so something really doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="332.919" dur="6.391">make sense and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="335.83" dur="4.98">that the government illusionary</text>
  <text start="339.31" dur="4.169">statistical numbers they&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="340.81" dur="5.52">further and further away from reality</text>
  <text start="343.479" dur="4.081">and people are starting to catch on this</text>
  <text start="346.33" dur="3.119">is why we see consumer confidence</text>
  <text start="347.56" dur="3.24">dropping this is why the people are</text>
  <text start="349.449" dur="5.491">saying okay something&amp;#39;s wrong with this</text>
  <text start="350.8" dur="6.81">economy it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense and what</text>
  <text start="354.94" dur="6.24">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that this</text>
  <text start="357.61" dur="6.299">whole entire system is one gigantic</text>
  <text start="361.18" dur="4.109">illusion and the illusion right now is</text>
  <text start="363.909" dur="3.151">falling apart there are more and more</text>
  <text start="365.289" dur="4.651">people being laid off left and right</text>
  <text start="367.06" dur="5.7">here we see Freeport they&amp;#39;re firing</text>
  <text start="369.94" dur="5.009">about twenty-five percent of its oil and</text>
  <text start="372.76" dur="4.589">gas workers and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot more</text>
  <text start="374.949" dur="5.78">companies now they&amp;#39;re starting to lay</text>
  <text start="377.349" dur="6.6">off thousands upon thousands of people</text>
  <text start="380.729" dur="5.531">department stores here in America we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="383.949" dur="5.931">going to see hundreds of them close</text>
  <text start="386.26" dur="6.27">we&amp;#39;re starting to see sears JC Penney</text>
  <text start="389.88" dur="4.69">macy&amp;#39;s nordstrom says you know what</text>
  <text start="392.53" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;re done expanding we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="394.57" dur="6.9">concentrate on the rack discount chain</text>
  <text start="397.93" dur="6.75">why is that if all the people are</text>
  <text start="401.47" dur="6.539">working and they have great jobs why is</text>
  <text start="404.68" dur="7.169">everything contracting because they</text>
  <text start="408.009" dur="6.03">realize these jobs are low paying people</text>
  <text start="411.849" dur="4.981">can&amp;#39;t find the full time great paying</text>
  <text start="414.039" dur="5.401">jobs and if they can&amp;#39;t find the full</text>
  <text start="416.83" dur="4.559">time great paying jobs what happens they</text>
  <text start="419.44" dur="3.24">don&amp;#39;t have the discretionary funds so</text>
  <text start="421.389" dur="3.75">they don&amp;#39;t have the discretionary funds</text>
  <text start="422.68" dur="4.32">guess what they&amp;#39;re not going out to buy</text>
  <text start="425.139" dur="4.441">the high-ticket items they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="427" dur="4.83">the discount stores they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="429.58" dur="4.05">the expense of department stores</text>
  <text start="431.83" dur="5.01">and this is why we see a lot of them</text>
  <text start="433.63" dur="7.53">starting to fall apart and close down</text>
  <text start="436.84" dur="6.59">and this is going to continue now in the</text>
  <text start="441.16" dur="4.71">housing market we&amp;#39;re seeing the bubble</text>
  <text start="443.43" dur="4.69">start to fall apart the housing bubble</text>
  <text start="445.87" dur="4.68">that the central bank the US government</text>
  <text start="448.12" dur="3.62">created is starting to fall apart right</text>
  <text start="450.55" dur="3.27">now for the fifth month in a row</text>
  <text start="451.74" dur="4.87">case-shiller home price growth</text>
  <text start="453.82" dur="5.7">year-on-year well back completely missed</text>
  <text start="456.61" dur="6.44">expectations februari sore prices at</text>
  <text start="459.52" dur="7.26">five point three percent below the 5.5</text>
  <text start="463.05" dur="6.46">expected and this is the weakest annual</text>
  <text start="466.78" dur="5.96">growth since September of 2015 now San</text>
  <text start="469.51" dur="5.85">Francisco and Seattle they rose the most</text>
  <text start="472.74" dur="4.78">Cleveland and New York they saw a big</text>
  <text start="475.36" dur="6.03">drops month on month and if you really</text>
  <text start="477.52" dur="5.55">look at this we see that 13 of the 20</text>
  <text start="481.39" dur="4.41">cities so a slower year-over-year</text>
  <text start="483.07" dur="6.15">numbers compared to last month so what</text>
  <text start="485.8" dur="6.69">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the prices are</text>
  <text start="489.22" dur="6.15">starting to level off in many areas a</text>
  <text start="492.49" dur="5.52">lot more now they&amp;#39;re starting to fall a</text>
  <text start="495.37" dur="4.32">lot of them are staying level because</text>
  <text start="498.01" dur="3.39">remember the central bank the US</text>
  <text start="499.69" dur="4.5">government they can&amp;#39;t control the entire</text>
  <text start="501.4" dur="6.57">country they pick certain cities to pump</text>
  <text start="504.19" dur="7.23">up and the outskirts everything</text>
  <text start="507.97" dur="6.27">bordering those areas they creep inward</text>
  <text start="511.42" dur="5.37">and those areas that weren&amp;#39;t affected</text>
  <text start="514.24" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re not part of the bubble all of a</text>
  <text start="516.79" dur="4.41">sudden we see major things starting to</text>
  <text start="519.22" dur="4.95">happen where prices are coming down</text>
  <text start="521.2" dur="4.71">rapidly and if you look out in the east</text>
  <text start="524.17" dur="5.28">and you look at many of the states</text>
  <text start="525.91" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;re outside of the cities you see</text>
  <text start="529.45" dur="4.86">that housing prices they are falling</text>
  <text start="532" dur="4.38">apart now we see new home sales</text>
  <text start="534.31" dur="4.44">declining we see starts declining</text>
  <text start="536.38" dur="5.4">permits declining existing home sales</text>
  <text start="538.75" dur="5.1">were declining and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="541.78" dur="5.39">right now is the housing market fall</text>
  <text start="543.85" dur="7.98">apart right in front of us so we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="547.17" dur="6.19">the Philly and the Dallas Fed they have</text>
  <text start="551.83" dur="4.38">been declining yes they had that little</text>
  <text start="553.36" dur="5.49">bump up in Philly but that has come</text>
  <text start="556.21" dur="4.17">straight down the richmond fed right now</text>
  <text start="558.85" dur="4.73">they&amp;#39;ve had their biggest drop since</text>
  <text start="560.38" dur="4.72">august shipments new orders wages all</text>
  <text start="563.58" dur="3.2">crashed</text>
  <text start="565.1" dur="5.55">and everything&amp;#39;s starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="566.78" dur="6.05">here we see core durable goods they have</text>
  <text start="570.65" dur="4.86">tumbled for the 14th month now this is</text>
  <text start="572.83" dur="6.13">absolutely awful this is your washers</text>
  <text start="575.51" dur="4.86">your dryers and they expected that this</text>
  <text start="578.96" dur="3.39">was going to be a lot better than it</text>
  <text start="580.37" dur="4.26">really was so what they did was as they</text>
  <text start="582.35" dur="5.64">went back in time they revised the</text>
  <text start="584.63" dur="6.39">numbers down word for februari so March</text>
  <text start="587.99" dur="4.83">wouldn&amp;#39;t look so bad now orders rose</text>
  <text start="591.02" dur="3.81">just point eight percent month on month</text>
  <text start="592.82" dur="3.69">they missed the expectations at one</text>
  <text start="594.83" dur="3.96">point nine percent and they got that</text>
  <text start="596.51" dur="4.56">point a present by revising the numbers</text>
  <text start="598.79" dur="6.3">in February if they didn&amp;#39;t revise those</text>
  <text start="601.07" dur="6.87">numbers it&amp;#39;d be way down because in</text>
  <text start="605.09" dur="4.86">February we saw the numbers at</text>
  <text start="607.94" dur="5.1">two-point-eight percent and they push</text>
  <text start="609.95" dur="4.77">them down to 3.1 percent negative so</text>
  <text start="613.04" dur="5.66">right now we&amp;#39;re in the 14th consecutive</text>
  <text start="614.72" dur="7.35">month where we&amp;#39;re seeing declines and</text>
  <text start="618.7" dur="6.57">this is a streak never seen in the 60</text>
  <text start="622.07" dur="5.91">years outside of a broad us recession</text>
  <text start="625.27" dur="5.83">now I think we&amp;#39;re way past the reception</text>
  <text start="627.98" dur="7.04">at this point this scenario that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="631.1" dur="7.17">been talking about we have been in this</text>
  <text start="635.02" dur="5.05">depression collapse scenario for quite a</text>
  <text start="638.27" dur="2.76">while now I know the government is not</text>
  <text start="640.07" dur="3.18">going to come out and just say hey</text>
  <text start="641.03" dur="4.08">everyone we&amp;#39;re in a recession depression</text>
  <text start="643.25" dur="3.92">they&amp;#39;re not going to do that the only</text>
  <text start="645.11" dur="4.5">time they will most likely do this is</text>
  <text start="647.17" dur="4.3">when the market comes tumbling down when</text>
  <text start="649.61" dur="3.51">they lose complete control and even at</text>
  <text start="651.47" dur="3.33">that point they&amp;#39;re going to wait a</text>
  <text start="653.12" dur="3.06">little while if you remember back in two</text>
  <text start="654.8" dur="2.58">thousand eight they didn&amp;#39;t come right</text>
  <text start="656.18" dur="3.03">out and say hey yeah we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="657.38" dur="3.48">recession man we&amp;#39;re sorry about this now</text>
  <text start="659.21" dur="4.68">they waited a little bit to see if</text>
  <text start="660.86" dur="4.59">everything would go right back up if</text>
  <text start="663.89" dur="5.22">they were able to push it back up and</text>
  <text start="665.45" dur="5.58">they couldn&amp;#39;t so this time it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="669.11" dur="4.98">be much much worse now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="671.03" dur="5.55">interesting is that exxon mobil they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="674.09" dur="7.5">been rated triple-a by S&amp;amp;P since 1930</text>
  <text start="676.58" dur="10.8">and today that ended they cut their</text>
  <text start="681.59" dur="9.42">rating down to a a-plus and this is the</text>
  <text start="687.38" dur="6.53">first time since the Great Depression so</text>
  <text start="691.01" dur="5.7">this is not a very good sign here and</text>
  <text start="693.91" dur="5.08">bank of america right now is continually</text>

  <text start="772.7" dur="6.84">from at this point it looks absolutely</text>
  <text start="775.12" dur="6.79">horrific at this point and as we go</text>

  <text start="811.43" dur="4.409">will we see a little bump up and then a</text>
