  <text start="29.279" dur="5.911">episode 645 and today&amp;#39;s date is april 18</text>
  <text start="32.91" dur="5.78">2015 and the title of this episode is</text>
  <text start="35.19" dur="5.85">the current economic collapse news brief</text>
  <text start="38.69" dur="3.939">let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="41.04" dur="3.42">collapse news now we understand Greece</text>
  <text start="42.629" dur="4.741">is coming down to the wire they owe a</text>
  <text start="44.46" dur="4.919">lot more money to the IMF and we can see</text>
  <text start="47.37" dur="4.169">at this point in time that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="49.379" dur="5.371">diving into the pension funds they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="51.539" dur="5.671">been looking for cash anywhere they</text>
  <text start="54.75" dur="6">possibly can find it and we see right</text>
  <text start="57.21" dur="5.669">now that Greece might be looking to exit</text>
  <text start="60.75" dur="4.229">the IMF has been telling us that no</text>
  <text start="62.879" dur="4.381">don&amp;#39;t worry about it they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="64.979" dur="3.721">to be exiting the eurozone and every</text>
  <text start="67.26" dur="4.2">time we hear the government officials or</text>
  <text start="68.7" dur="5.04">central bankers tell us something we see</text>
  <text start="71.46" dur="4.83">it always seems to be the opposite of</text>
  <text start="73.74" dur="5.07">what really happens and we&amp;#39;re seeing now</text>
  <text start="76.29" dur="4.829">that one of the proposed measures to be</text>
  <text start="78.81" dur="5.04">implemented in Greece just before or</text>
  <text start="81.119" dur="5.101">during its default and or exit from the</text>
  <text start="83.85" dur="4.67">eurozone in addition to a pervasive</text>
  <text start="86.22" dur="5.359">capital controls of course is the</text>
  <text start="88.52" dur="7.54">implementation of a parallel currency</text>
  <text start="91.579" dur="7.631">just 24 to 36 hours ago Greece might</text>
  <text start="96.06" dur="6.39">resort to io u--&amp;#39;s or capital controls</text>
  <text start="99.21" dur="5.58">to avoid a disorderly default and keep</text>
  <text start="102.45" dur="4.8">the banks afloat for now first it could</text>
  <text start="104.79" dur="5.73">issue I&amp;#39;ll iou&amp;#39;s to pay public sector</text>
  <text start="107.25" dur="5.61">workers and pensioners and then free up</text>
  <text start="110.52" dur="6.15">some money to repay its debt but this</text>
  <text start="112.86" dur="7.17">could cause economic chaos in Greece</text>
  <text start="116.67" dur="8.4">people will riot people will be upset we</text>
  <text start="120.03" dur="9.589">also see that Russia might loan grease</text>
  <text start="125.07" dur="6.39">up to five billion in there Turkish</text>
  <text start="129.619" dur="4.451">pipeline</text>
  <text start="131.46" dur="4.83">now we see Russia out today saying no no</text>
  <text start="134.07" dur="5.76">we are not going to do this Russia</text>
  <text start="136.29" dur="6.03">denied the reports a German magazine put</text>
  <text start="139.83" dur="4.8">this out during magazine Spiegel they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="142.32" dur="4.97">saying we are not going to give Greece a</text>
  <text start="144.63" dur="5.43">loan of up to five billion dollars and</text>
  <text start="147.29" dur="6.22">we&amp;#39;re going to have to see and watch how</text>
  <text start="150.06" dur="6.99">this plays out because Russia could step</text>
  <text start="153.51" dur="5.97">in we know that tsipras met with Putin</text>
  <text start="157.05" dur="4.5">we understand they sign economic deals</text>
  <text start="159.48" dur="6.09">we understand the pipeline will be going</text>
  <text start="161.55" dur="7.05">in and if they do dump the eurozone we</text>
  <text start="165.57" dur="6.39">realize that Russia would remove the</text>
  <text start="168.6" dur="5.94">food embargo and this would spur</text>
  <text start="171.96" dur="5.46">economic growth and we understand the</text>
  <text start="174.54" dur="5.34">government of Greece has been looking at</text>
  <text start="177.42" dur="4.2">all different ways to get around this</text>
  <text start="179.88" dur="4.44">debt well they&amp;#39;re coming down to the</text>
  <text start="181.62" dur="6.54">wire and it looks like they might have</text>
  <text start="184.32" dur="6.39">no other option but to default at this</text>
  <text start="188.16" dur="5.28">time to leave the eurozone but don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="190.71" dur="4.71">worry the bankers have already protected</text>
  <text start="193.44" dur="4.17">themselves with their special little</text>
  <text start="195.42" dur="4.59">communities committee to say that you</text>
  <text start="197.61" dur="4.53">know what these credit default swaps</text>
  <text start="200.01" dur="4.38">there&amp;#39;s a what there was no default here</text>
  <text start="202.14" dur="5.49">and that means we don&amp;#39;t have to pay out</text>
  <text start="204.39" dur="6.47">any of this and we can see the bankers</text>
  <text start="207.63" dur="5.73">always seem to protect their interests</text>
  <text start="210.86" dur="5.29">the interests of the people of the</text>
  <text start="213.36" dur="6.36">country the interest of the country they</text>
  <text start="216.15" dur="6.36">could care less about we see out in</text>
  <text start="219.72" dur="6.36">England that the number of British</text>
  <text start="222.51" dur="6.78">people relying on food banks is expected</text>
  <text start="226.08" dur="5.34">to reach 1 million despite a huge</text>
  <text start="229.29" dur="6.24">increase in the number of people that</text>
  <text start="231.42" dur="7.26">are working how can this be it makes no</text>
  <text start="235.53" dur="5.61">sense despite two million more people</text>
  <text start="238.68" dur="5.67">being in work now than in 2010 the</text>
  <text start="241.14" dur="7.05">number of people using food banks has</text>
  <text start="244.35" dur="6.3">soared under the government too many</text>
  <text start="248.19" dur="4.47">working people are being paid so little</text>
  <text start="250.65" dur="5.31">that they can&amp;#39;t afford to feed their</text>
  <text start="252.66" dur="5.85">families with 1.5 million more in jobs</text>
  <text start="255.96" dur="4.26">paying less than the living wage and a</text>
  <text start="258.51" dur="3.96">huge rise in a number of people on</text>
  <text start="260.22" dur="4.44">zero-hour contracts it is getting</text>
  <text start="262.47" dur="3.6">tougher and tougher to</text>
  <text start="264.66" dur="4.68">for people to make it we see this here</text>
  <text start="266.07" dur="7.5">in the United States we are a part time</text>
  <text start="269.34" dur="9.54">nation the eurozone UK Canada it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="273.57" dur="10.11">becoming a part time system all the good</text>
  <text start="278.88" dur="6.75">jobs are disappearing there is no</text>
  <text start="283.68" dur="4.08">economic growth and people are losing</text>
  <text start="285.63" dur="3.9">their good jobs they can&amp;#39;t find the good</text>
  <text start="287.76" dur="4.26">jobs and they&amp;#39;re going into part-time</text>
  <text start="289.53" dur="4.38">work where they can&amp;#39;t bring enough money</text>
  <text start="292.02" dur="3.96">in and we here we see it here in the</text>
  <text start="293.91" dur="3.27">United States this is why most of the</text>
  <text start="295.98" dur="4.32">people that are on government assistance</text>
  <text start="297.18" dur="5.55">they are working like crazy just to make</text>
  <text start="300.3" dur="5.55">it and it&amp;#39;s not enough and they need to</text>
  <text start="302.73" dur="7.26">go out to the government to get</text>
  <text start="305.85" dur="6.06">subsidized just to survive and we</text>
  <text start="309.99" dur="4.47">understand the economy is completely</text>
  <text start="311.91" dur="5.55">falling apart the mortgage banker</text>
  <text start="314.46" dur="5.25">Association the applications once again</text>
  <text start="317.46" dur="5.64">have fallen by two-point-three percent</text>
  <text start="319.71" dur="8.36">and when we look at this we see well</text>
  <text start="323.1" dur="10.26">yeah we saw the mortgage applications</text>
  <text start="328.07" dur="8.92">drop from September 2012 all the way</text>
  <text start="333.36" dur="7.1">down up to this point in January we had</text>
  <text start="336.99" dur="6.33">a bump up and what started in January ah</text>
  <text start="340.46" dur="5.65">the new programs Freddie and Fannie</text>
  <text start="343.32" dur="6.66">three percent down whilst will accept</text>
  <text start="346.11" dur="6.54">the subprime people and we also saw</text>
  <text start="349.98" dur="4.77">banks implementing their new programs</text>
  <text start="352.65" dur="3.99">zero percent down will pay for the</text>
  <text start="354.75" dur="5.63">closing costs builders are saying listen</text>
  <text start="356.64" dur="3.74">we&amp;#39;ll pay will pick up the closing costs</text>
  <text start="360.59" dur="6.76">expenses don&amp;#39;t worry about it and we can</text>
  <text start="363.96" dur="7.05">see in January it spiked right back up I</text>
  <text start="367.35" dur="6.15">guess what it&amp;#39;s falling once again and</text>
  <text start="371.01" dur="5.4">if you come to the X 22 you can see the</text>
  <text start="373.5" dur="4.83">graph of this and right now we are going</text>
  <text start="376.41" dur="3.12">to dive down as we move through the</text>
  <text start="378.33" dur="3.69">spring and summer you have to remember</text>
  <text start="379.53" dur="6.45">for real estate the spring and summer</text>
  <text start="382.02" dur="6.68">months are there basically the hot time</text>
  <text start="385.98" dur="5.73">for real estate once we get out of</text>
  <text start="388.7" dur="4.839">August that&amp;#39;s it for real estate so</text>
  <text start="391.71" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch and see how</text>
  <text start="393.539" dur="3.451">real estate performs I think we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="395.13" dur="3.02">to see a tiny little bump up and I think</text>
  <text start="396.99" dur="3.71">things are going to</text>
  <text start="398.15" dur="6">really accelerate and get worse this is</text>
  <text start="400.7" dur="6.57">what we saw last year if you go back to</text>
  <text start="404.15" dur="6.84">my previous reports back in April May</text>
  <text start="407.27" dur="5.61">June you can hear what I said in that</text>
  <text start="410.99" dur="3.57">time I said we&amp;#39;re going to see a bump up</text>
  <text start="412.88" dur="3.24">in the beginning of the year and then</text>
  <text start="414.56" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s just going to fade off and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="416.12" dur="4.35">exactly what we saw and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="418.25" dur="3.93">see the same thing occur right now and</text>
  <text start="420.47" dur="4.14">actually this time it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="422.18" dur="6.63">worse because we are at the end game</text>
  <text start="424.61" dur="7.17">here Americans are tapped out we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="428.81" dur="6.18">have jobs we don&amp;#39;t have credit we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="431.78" dur="6.09">have money saved there&amp;#39;s nothing else to</text>
  <text start="434.99" dur="5.82">give and it&amp;#39;s showing up all over the</text>
  <text start="437.87" dur="6.93">country it&amp;#39;s showing up in retail it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="440.81" dur="9.15">showing up in real estate it&amp;#39;s showing</text>
  <text start="444.8" dur="8.28">up in um food stores where people are</text>
  <text start="449.96" dur="6.71">just going in using government help to</text>
  <text start="453.08" dur="7.02">buy the food it&amp;#39;s showing up everywhere</text>
  <text start="456.67" dur="6.6">but of course our government they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="460.1" dur="6.24">looking the other way they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="463.27" dur="5.2">they&amp;#39;re so blinded with pretty much</text>
  <text start="466.34" dur="4.59">everything they aren&amp;#39;t really doing the</text>
  <text start="468.47" dur="4.29">research our officials who are supposed</text>
  <text start="470.93" dur="3.48">to be working for the people are not</text>
  <text start="472.76" dur="4.41">doing their job and we see right now</text>
  <text start="474.41" dur="4.98">what they&amp;#39;re worried about is themselves</text>
  <text start="477.17" dur="4.53">what they&amp;#39;re worried about is making</text>
  <text start="479.39" dur="5.52">more money what they&amp;#39;re worried about is</text>
  <text start="481.7" dur="5.22">pleasing the corporations that put them</text>
  <text start="484.91" dur="8.04">into power countries that put them into</text>
  <text start="486.92" dur="9.84">power and we know come June first it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="492.95" dur="8.43">very important day because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="496.76" dur="6.89">seeing is that the Patriot Act will</text>
  <text start="501.38" dur="5.07">expire automatically without real</text>
  <text start="503.65" dur="5.92">reauthorization from Congress naturally</text>
  <text start="506.45" dur="6.93">this is causing a panic attack within</text>
  <text start="509.57" dur="5.76">the heart of NSA FBI and all the</text>
  <text start="513.38" dur="4.95">authoritarian Lackey legislators in</text>
  <text start="515.33" dur="5.49">washington the US government central</text>
  <text start="518.33" dur="4.62">bankers are now figuring out ways they</text>
  <text start="520.82" dur="6.12">can sneak it into another piece of</text>
  <text start="522.95" dur="5.79">legislation without anyone noticing what</text>
  <text start="526.94" dur="4.35">do they do well they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="528.74" dur="3.39">sneak it into the USA Freedom Act the</text>
  <text start="531.29" dur="2.88">USA Freedom</text>
  <text start="532.13" dur="3.84">act is back and it appears to be the</text>
  <text start="534.17" dur="6.39">vehicle being used to reauthorize</text>
  <text start="535.97" dur="6.48">section 215 of the Patriot Act they are</text>
  <text start="540.56" dur="3.51">going to do whatever they have to do to</text>
  <text start="542.45" dur="3.21">continually spy on the people and I</text>
  <text start="544.07" dur="3.44">don&amp;#39;t even think they need the Patriot</text>
  <text start="545.66" dur="3.87">Act I think they would just do it anyhow</text>
  <text start="547.51" dur="3.78">despite on the people and you have to</text>
  <text start="549.53" dur="5.52">remember the reasons why they are spine</text>
  <text start="551.29" dur="6.25">they&amp;#39;re doing this to track everyone</text>
  <text start="555.05" dur="4.62">your purchases your movement who you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="557.54" dur="6.84">friends with they also use it to</text>
  <text start="559.67" dur="8.82">blackmail judges government officials to</text>
  <text start="564.38" dur="7.32">push their own agendas forward and have</text>
  <text start="568.49" dur="6.36">people do things they normally wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="571.7" dur="4.44">do I mean look at Obamacare the judge</text>
  <text start="574.85" dur="4.86">said it was completely unconstitutional</text>
  <text start="576.14" dur="6.06">then all of a sudden he changed his mind</text>
  <text start="579.71" dur="5.73">and after he said it was constitutional</text>
  <text start="582.2" dur="6.06">he left for two weeks avoiding the press</text>
  <text start="585.44" dur="6.9">and everything else they must have had</text>
  <text start="588.26" dur="7.52">something on him and we could see that</text>
  <text start="592.34" dur="5.91">Congress they don&amp;#39;t know how to pass</text>
  <text start="595.78" dur="4.48">reauthorization so they are trying to</text>
  <text start="598.25" dur="3.3">sneak it in they can&amp;#39;t explain to the</text>
  <text start="600.26" dur="3.42">American people saying well we had to</text>
  <text start="601.55" dur="3.99">pass it because because they said they</text>
  <text start="603.68" dur="6.15">were going to reform they said they were</text>
  <text start="605.54" dur="7.17">going to stop this advocates of the bill</text>
  <text start="609.83" dur="4.83">in both congressional chambers including</text>

  <text start="854.88" dur="5.85">they&amp;#39;re willing to take as they hide in</text>
  <text start="857.4" dur="6.93">their bunkers we see that the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="860.73" dur="6.75">is definitely getting ready for the war</text>
  <text start="864.33" dur="6.75">that&amp;#39;s coming up we understand that we</text>
  <text start="867.48" dur="5.4">see a lot of strange things occurring</text>
  <text start="871.08" dur="3.6">where we seen or read now going into</text>
  <text start="872.88" dur="6.33">Cheyenne Mountain we see Walmart&amp;#39;s are</text>

  <text start="886.41" dur="6.45">Pacific the Middle East is ramping up</text>
  <text start="889.11" dur="6.53">war has started and we see that the</text>
  <text start="892.86" dur="7.11">Pentagon now is looking to create their</text>
  <text start="895.64" dur="8.05">new cyber force it&amp;#39;s called blunt force</text>
  <text start="899.97" dur="6.54">trauma the Pentagon and we discussed</text>
  <text start="903.69" dur="6.11">this before but we can see what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="906.51" dur="6.36">going to do with this blunt force trauma</text>
  <text start="909.8" dur="9.37">basically the Pentagon says how do you</text>
  <text start="912.87" dur="10.53">make an enemy completely vulnerable well</text>
  <text start="919.17" dur="7.26">one way to do it is to use a cyber</text>
  <text start="923.4" dur="6.3">attack and how do you use it well what</text>
  <text start="926.43" dur="5.589">you do is you hit them and you make</text>
  <text start="929.7" dur="5.739">their air defense system go completely</text>
  <text start="932.019" dur="4.711">in the first minute of the conflict how</text>
  <text start="935.439" dur="4.861">do you make a surface-to-air missile</text>
  <text start="936.73" dur="5.549">radar show a thousand false targets that</text>
  <text start="940.3" dur="3.99">all look real so you don&amp;#39;t know where</text>
  <text start="942.279" dur="4.8">the real packages in the middle of that</text>
  <text start="944.29" dur="6.029">well you use some type of cyber attack</text>
  <text start="947.079" dur="5.461">you plant malware and right now what</text>
  <text start="950.319" dur="4.17">they want to do is they want to build</text>
  <text start="952.54" dur="6.62">this cyber mission because they realize</text>
  <text start="954.489" dur="8.09">when we start this war Russia China and</text>
  <text start="959.16" dur="6.76">the other countries they&amp;#39;re all going to</text>
  <text start="962.579" dur="6.7">resort to cyber attacks this will be</text>
  <text start="965.92" dur="6.479">part of this new war strategy and they</text>
  <text start="969.279" dur="6.391">will hit the electrical grid they will</text>
  <text start="972.399" dur="6.211">hit nuclear plants they will hit the</text>
  <text start="975.67" dur="5.909">water system the gas system the</text>
  <text start="978.61" dur="5.789">financial system and the Pentagon wants</text>
  <text start="981.579" dur="7.26">to put together about 133 dreams made up</text>
  <text start="984.399" dur="6.511">of about 6,200 troops and they want to</text>
  <text start="988.839" dur="4.98">put them all together and get them ready</text>
  <text start="990.91" dur="6.51">as quickly as they possibly can for this</text>
  <text start="993.819" dur="6.18">new war because we understand that as</text>
  <text start="997.42" dur="4.259">the system falls apart the United States</text>
  <text start="999.999" dur="3.721">government central bankers will</text>
  <text start="1001.679" dur="4.32">continually provoke the other countries</text>
  <text start="1003.72" dur="6.899">to start something and if they cannot</text>
  <text start="1005.999" dur="7.59">start it they will basically push a</text>
  <text start="1010.619" dur="4.83">false flag and when they push this false</text>
  <text start="1013.589" dur="4.321">flag they will make it look like it was</text>
  <text start="1015.449" dur="5.37">the group or the country who created</text>
  <text start="1017.91" dur="5.7">this and this is why everyone needs to</text>
  <text start="1020.819" dur="6.09">prepare needs to be prepared because you</text>
