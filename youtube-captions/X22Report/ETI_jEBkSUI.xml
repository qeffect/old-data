  <text start="291.31" dur="5.11">US and we stand firm with you and your</text>
  <text start="293.68" dur="4.84">agenda to see that America gets a better</text>
  <text start="296.42" dur="4.41">many in the media and though</text>
  <text start="298.52" dur="4.68">self-interest in China have argued that</text>
  <text start="300.83" dur="4.41">Americans are bearing the cost of these</text>
  <text start="303.2" dur="4.53">terrorists that is simply false</text>
  <text start="305.24" dur="5.01">China is bearing the burden of these</text>
  <text start="307.73" dur="4.65">tariffs China has had to lower its</text>
  <text start="310.25" dur="4.38">prices and they are experiencing fewer</text>
  <text start="312.38" dur="3.71">exports lower profits and lower tax</text>
  <text start="314.63" dur="3.78">revenue as a result of the tariffs</text>

  <text start="318.41" dur="4.01">economy experience a slower rate of</text>
  <text start="320.18" dur="5.73">growth and employment in the future</text>
  <text start="322.42" dur="5.56">importantly over the past year the</text>
  <text start="325.91" dur="4.98">tariffs in question have had a CEO</text>
  <text start="327.98" dur="5.07">impact on the price of inflation and</text>
  <text start="330.89" dur="4.62">this is after the u.s. levy tariffs on</text>
  <text start="333.05" dur="3.57">over 250 billion dollars worth of</text>
  <text start="335.51" dur="4.17">imports from China</text>
  <text start="336.62" dur="5.79">this demonstrates that China is actually</text>
  <text start="339.68" dur="4.98">bearing the cost of tariffs we support</text>
  <text start="342.41" dur="4.38">your steadfastness to stand up to large</text>
  <text start="344.66" dur="3.93">multinationals who have sold out the</text>
  <text start="346.79" dur="3.63">American worker for low-cost labor from</text>
  <text start="348.59" dur="4.29">China this is important for two reasons</text>
  <text start="350.42" dur="4.38">first America needs a strong</text>
  <text start="352.88" dur="5.88">manufacturing economy for jobs and</text>
  <text start="354.8" dur="6.45">national security and second China is</text>
  <text start="358.76" dur="4.26">among the world&amp;#39;s worst abusers of human</text>
  <text start="361.25" dur="4.29">rights as noted by many of the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="363.02" dur="5.01">leading humanitarian aid groups we ask</text>
  <text start="365.54" dur="4.77">that these human rights abuses be a</text>
  <text start="368.03" dur="5.34">topic of discussion as you tighten the</text>
  <text start="370.31" dur="4.89">financial grip of China no longer should</text>
  <text start="373.37" dur="4.23">America play second fiddle to China it</text>
  <text start="375.2" dur="4.92">is important we stand united behind this</text>
  <text start="377.6" dur="4.59">agenda and put our country over</text>
  <text start="380.12" dur="4.17">political differences America&amp;#39;s national</text>

  <text start="401.81" dur="8.43">out now letting the president know that</text>
  <text start="406.63" dur="8.26">America comes first we want a better</text>
  <text start="410.24" dur="8.78">economy to make our lives in this</text>
  <text start="414.89" dur="6.39">country better economically</text>
  <text start="419.02" dur="3.01">people have been struggling for a very</text>
  <text start="421.28" dur="5.25">long time</text>
  <text start="422.03" dur="6.98">and it is time and you can see it</text>
  <text start="426.53" dur="5.58">happening where people are waking up</text>
  <text start="429.01" dur="5.56">they&amp;#39;re realizing there&amp;#39;s been problems</text>
  <text start="432.11" dur="6.78">now this is just the beginning they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="434.57" dur="7.29">behind Trump with China and this is the</text>
  <text start="438.89" dur="7.58">beginning stages of people getting</text>
  <text start="441.86" dur="7.11">behind Trump with the economy and</text>
  <text start="446.47" dur="4.81">they&amp;#39;re no longer hiding in the shadows</text>
  <text start="448.97" dur="6.6">you know they&amp;#39;re no longer just taking</text>
  <text start="451.28" dur="10.05">it the next phase to this is moving into</text>
  <text start="455.57" dur="9.21">the central bank phase where Trump will</text>
  <text start="461.33" dur="7.62">continually point the finger at the</text>
  <text start="464.78" dur="8.13">central bank bring awareness to what the</text>
  <text start="468.95" dur="7.22">central bank has done now if China has</text>
  <text start="472.91" dur="6.63">done this has hurt American companies</text>
  <text start="476.17" dur="6.22">what is the central bank done because</text>
  <text start="479.54" dur="8.82">the central bank is a lot worse than</text>
  <text start="482.39" dur="10.02">China and this is just the beginning the</text>
  <text start="488.36" dur="7.77">American people are telling the</text>
  <text start="492.41" dur="7.44">president the world what we want people</text>
  <text start="496.13" dur="6.3">in other countries are doing this now</text>
  <text start="499.85" dur="5.16">very interestingly we know that Trump</text>
  <text start="502.43" dur="7.53">has been using the deep state central</text>
  <text start="505.01" dur="9">bank weapons against themselves and he</text>
  <text start="509.96" dur="6.269">has pushed the GDP numbers pushed the</text>
  <text start="514.01" dur="7.02">unemployment numbers pushed the stock</text>
  <text start="516.229" dur="9.091">market to all-time new highs and lows</text>
  <text start="521.03" dur="7.23">before unemployment and at the time when</text>
  <text start="525.32" dur="5.88">he was coming into office Obama said you</text>
  <text start="528.26" dur="4.5">would need a magic wand how are you</text>
  <text start="531.2" dur="3.9">going to bring back manufacturing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="532.76" dur="5.1">impossible how would you ever get a GDP</text>
  <text start="535.1" dur="7.7">number over two percent it&amp;#39;s impossible</text>
  <text start="537.86" dur="7.65">and it was possible because Trump</text>
  <text start="542.8" dur="5.68">understands the system I do believe that</text>
  <text start="545.51" dur="5.97">Obama thought that the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="548.48" dur="7.95">and those players within</text>
  <text start="551.48" dur="9.93">government would never reveal how this</text>
  <text start="556.43" dur="9">all works how everything is manipulated</text>
  <text start="561.41" dur="6.5">how it&amp;#39;s controlled how the central bank</text>
  <text start="565.43" dur="5.24">has the ability to make the economy</text>
  <text start="567.91" dur="6.03">statistically look any way you want but</text>
  <text start="570.67" dur="6.55">guess what Trump</text>
  <text start="573.94" dur="5.56">figure it out he had help there were</text>
  <text start="577.22" dur="8.46">many people working on this and he found</text>
  <text start="579.5" dur="8.06">the magic wand how it all works and Don</text>
  <text start="585.68" dur="6.81">jr. tweeted out the following</text>
  <text start="587.56" dur="7.389">he said well abracadabra buddy I guess</text>
  <text start="592.49" dur="5.399">there is a magic wand for that at real</text>
  <text start="594.949" dur="6.33">Donald Trump has it and is using it for</text>
  <text start="597.889" dur="6.421">all Americans as promised it just takes</text>
  <text start="601.279" dur="9.12">a real leader one with with experience</text>
  <text start="604.31" dur="9.769">and guts and it&amp;#39;s true remember the old</text>
  <text start="610.399" dur="6.661">regime was trying to get us used to</text>
  <text start="614.079" dur="7.091">something completely different we won&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="628.94" dur="3.899">seeing that that wasn&amp;#39;t true now</text>
  <text start="631.31" dur="3.899">remember I&amp;#39;ve always said this in the</text>

  <text start="635.209" dur="6.511">central bank tells you it is always the</text>
