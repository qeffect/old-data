  <text start="48.72" dur="3.6">for you are we looking at the start of</text>
  <text start="50.4" dur="4.11">the next stock market crash you can see</text>
  <text start="52.32" dur="3.87">that it has been a long upward run for</text>
  <text start="54.51" dur="3.51">stocks but recently the market has</text>
  <text start="56.19" dur="4.2">started to topple the big question is</text>
  <text start="58.02" dur="4.23">how far will the market fall and during</text>
  <text start="60.39" dur="3.3">this time noble gold they have been</text>
  <text start="62.25" dur="3.45">getting their clients to buy precious</text>
  <text start="63.69" dur="3.69">metals as a hedge against their pension</text>
  <text start="65.7" dur="2.97">funds losing massive chunks of their</text>
  <text start="67.38" dur="3.39">investments if you&amp;#39;re worried about</text>

  <text start="80.25" dur="5.45">collapse financial news now everything</text>
  <text start="83.07" dur="6.57">is happening according to the plan for</text>
  <text start="85.7" dur="5.49">many it might not seem that way but for</text>
  <text start="89.64" dur="6.03">those people that been following along</text>
  <text start="91.19" dur="5.92">the plan is actually working and yes</text>
  <text start="95.67" dur="5.1">there&amp;#39;s going to be periods of time</text>
  <text start="97.11" dur="5.28">where you think wow everything is not</text>
  <text start="100.77" dur="5.94">going the way I thought it was going</text>
  <text start="102.39" dur="8.729">well that&amp;#39;s expectations that&amp;#39;s what you</text>
  <text start="106.71" dur="6.839">wanted to happen sometimes the plan</text>
  <text start="111.119" dur="5.221">doesn&amp;#39;t happen straight out of the box</text>
  <text start="113.549" dur="7.021">sometimes you need to go around</text>
  <text start="116.34" dur="6.389">obstacles to get to the goal and Trump</text>
  <text start="120.57" dur="4.1">is used to this the Patriots are used to</text>
  <text start="122.729" dur="5.151">this they understand that sometimes</text>
  <text start="124.67" dur="7.36">there are objects that get in your way</text>
  <text start="127.88" dur="7.45">but eventually you get to the end you</text>
  <text start="132.03" dur="5.64">get to where you want to go and we are</text>
  <text start="135.33" dur="6.78">getting there and when you look at the</text>
  <text start="137.67" dur="7.47">economy we know two things first the</text>
  <text start="142.11" dur="5.76">central bank controls the economy the</text>
  <text start="145.14" dur="8.4">central bank created this economy back</text>
  <text start="147.87" dur="9.51">in 1913 1971 they recreated it fully in</text>
  <text start="153.54" dur="6.63">their image and they continued it going</text>
  <text start="157.38" dur="6.329">up to this point because they wanted</text>
  <text start="160.17" dur="4.36">full and utter control which they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="163.709" dur="3.581">done across</text>
  <text start="164.53" dur="5.61">the world and how did they do this they</text>
  <text start="167.29" dur="6.75">did it by spreading debt the problem is</text>
  <text start="170.14" dur="7.14">is that they&amp;#39;re now exposed everyone can</text>
  <text start="174.04" dur="4.83">see what they&amp;#39;ve done now many people</text>
  <text start="177.28" dur="5.07">are not looking many people don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="178.87" dur="7.77">to see but those who are looking you can</text>
  <text start="182.35" dur="8.73">see that they have no place to go</text>
  <text start="186.64" dur="6.75">they have no out and the system will</text>
  <text start="191.08" dur="5.07">eventually fall apart now they were</text>
  <text start="193.39" dur="6.33">gonna bring it down during the 2020</text>
  <text start="196.15" dur="6.2">elections Trump the Patriots they knew</text>
  <text start="199.72" dur="6.21">they couldn&amp;#39;t allow this to happen and</text>
  <text start="202.35" dur="5.65">this is why the Patriots this is why</text>
  <text start="205.93" dur="5.339">they took control they took the magic</text>
  <text start="208" dur="6.209">wand and they used it now I know way</text>
  <text start="211.269" dur="5.791">before Trump came into presidency he was</text>
  <text start="214.209" dur="5.491">talking about how the economy was how</text>
  <text start="217.06" dur="3.899">the market is not the economy but we</text>
  <text start="219.7" dur="4.52">need to remember something very</text>
  <text start="220.959" dur="7.291">important you just can&amp;#39;t come in and</text>
  <text start="224.22" dur="5.23">save a central bank economy the only</text>
  <text start="228.25" dur="3.53">thing you can do with the central bank</text>
  <text start="229.45" dur="5.099">economy when it&amp;#39;s at its end stage is</text>
  <text start="231.78" dur="5.65">you can just kick it down the street a</text>
  <text start="234.549" dur="8.25">little bit more that&amp;#39;s it and the only</text>
  <text start="237.43" dur="9.21">way to change everything is to create an</text>
  <text start="242.799" dur="7.44">economy that is not based off of the</text>
  <text start="246.64" dur="5.7">central bank&amp;#39;s plan Trump knew this when</text>
  <text start="250.239" dur="5.25">he came into office he wasn&amp;#39;t gonna come</text>
  <text start="252.34" dur="5.79">out and say listen this is a central</text>
  <text start="255.489" dur="4.291">bank economy it&amp;#39;s going to implode we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="258.13" dur="3.78">gonna go through a recession we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="259.78" dur="4.86">go through a depression and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="261.91" dur="5.93">to be very hard for people the whole</text>
  <text start="264.64" dur="6.36">entire nation would completely collapse</text>
  <text start="267.84" dur="5.639">the mainstream media the deep state they</text>
  <text start="271" dur="6.09">would have a field day so what did the</text>
  <text start="273.479" dur="7.211">Patriots decide to do they decided to</text>
  <text start="277.09" dur="7.85">come up with a plan and this plan has</text>
  <text start="280.69" dur="9.17">many different avenues many different</text>
  <text start="284.94" dur="8.46">systems that they have to control first</text>
  <text start="289.86" dur="5.95">before they can make their next move and</text>
  <text start="293.4" dur="3.729">they knew that this was going to be very</text>
  <text start="295.81" dur="3.869">tough</text>
  <text start="297.129" dur="5.79">they knew that the other side was going</text>
  <text start="299.679" dur="6.57">to fight to the very very end so Trump</text>
  <text start="302.919" dur="4.77">and the Patriots decided let&amp;#39;s use what</text>
  <text start="306.249" dur="6.48">they&amp;#39;ve been using for a very long time</text>
  <text start="307.689" dur="9.3">and make the economy look great they</text>
  <text start="312.729" dur="8.25">already knew that the central bank the</text>
  <text start="316.989" dur="8.28">Fed they were going to have to cut rates</text>
  <text start="320.979" dur="7.14">and move from tightening to stimulus to</text>
  <text start="325.269" dur="5.4">keep the system going the system went on</text>
  <text start="328.119" dur="5.491">way too long as it is and the only way</text>
  <text start="330.669" dur="7.01">the system can continue on is with these</text>
  <text start="333.61" dur="8.009">ingredients that&amp;#39;s it so the plan was</text>
  <text start="337.679" dur="6.25">start to call out the Fed tell the Fed</text>
  <text start="341.619" dur="5.79">tell the public tell the mainstream</text>
  <text start="343.929" dur="5.311">media listen stop raising rates stop</text>
  <text start="347.409" dur="4.35">raising rates once they stop raising</text>
  <text start="349.24" dur="5.099">rates they moved into the second part of</text>
  <text start="351.759" dur="5.07">the plan okay now we need you to cut</text>
  <text start="354.339" dur="5.91">rates now we need you to stop tightening</text>
  <text start="356.829" dur="5.52">now we need stimulus and here we are</text>
  <text start="360.249" dur="5.43">today because when we look at the</text>
  <text start="362.349" dur="5.701">central bank economy it is declining</text>
  <text start="365.679" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s imploding on itself which we knew</text>
  <text start="368.05" dur="4.259">would happen it happened throughout</text>
  <text start="369.729" dur="7.59">history it&amp;#39;s following the same exact</text>
  <text start="372.309" dur="7.08">pattern there is no difference yes you</text>
  <text start="377.319" dur="4.14">can create jobs yes you can manipulate</text>
  <text start="379.389" dur="4.68">the numbers yes you can make the stock</text>
  <text start="381.459" dur="4.14">market go up but I want everything</text>
  <text start="384.069" dur="4.26">starting to fall apart all the other</text>
  <text start="385.599" dur="5.07">indicators all this manipulation won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="388.329" dur="5.221">mean anything because the manipulation</text>
  <text start="390.669" dur="7.29">then will be exposed and we&amp;#39;re almost at</text>
  <text start="393.55" dur="8.969">that point and this is why the Fed at</text>
  <text start="397.959" dur="5.82">this point has reversed its policy I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="402.519" dur="3.3">going to be talking about that in just a</text>
  <text start="403.779" dur="5.91">minute but when we look at the central</text>
  <text start="405.819" dur="7.37">bank the job numbers completely missed</text>
  <text start="409.689" dur="7.08">we added about 75,000 jobs now they were</text>
  <text start="413.189" dur="5.71">expecting a hundred and seventy five</text>
  <text start="416.769" dur="3.93">thousand jobs this is a hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="418.899" dur="4.32">below what they thought was going to</text>
  <text start="420.699" dur="5.97">happen now March those numbers were</text>
  <text start="423.219" dur="5.4">revised down from 189 to 150 3,000 and</text>
  <text start="426.669" dur="3.871">the change for April was revised down</text>
  <text start="428.619" dur="5.431">from 263 down</text>
  <text start="430.54" dur="5.85">2:24 and we&amp;#39;ve seen this before this</text>
  <text start="434.05" dur="6.21">happens many many times with these</text>
  <text start="436.39" dur="8.22">manipulated numbers but the important</text>
  <text start="440.26" dur="7.44">point of all of this is Trump needs the</text>
  <text start="444.61" dur="6.15">time the Patriots need the time to</text>
  <text start="447.7" dur="6.54">prepare the next economy this is why</text>
  <text start="450.76" dur="7.05">Trump is placing tariffs on China making</text>
  <text start="454.24" dur="6.75">trade deals with many countries forcing</text>
  <text start="457.81" dur="6.15">Mexico to do what he needs them to do</text>
  <text start="460.99" dur="5.19">this is why he will rework NAFTA do I</text>
  <text start="463.96" dur="5.73">think that&amp;#39;s complete do I think he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="466.18" dur="6">satisfied with the new deal for right</text>
  <text start="469.69" dur="5.22">now but I think that&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="472.18" dur="4.77">completely overhauled once they have</text>
  <text start="474.91" dur="4.92">complete and utter control of the next</text>
  <text start="476.95" dur="5.58">economy and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="479.83" dur="6.65">is that the tariffs that were placed on</text>
  <text start="482.53" dur="7.62">China they&amp;#39;re really having no effect on</text>
  <text start="486.48" dur="5.59">the actual prices in the store and I</text>
  <text start="490.15" dur="4.62">know everyone was complaining that yes</text>
  <text start="492.07" dur="4.62">because of these tariffs the consumer is</text>
  <text start="494.77" dur="4.56">going to feel the weight of this and the</text>
  <text start="496.69" dur="5.34">prices are going to rise and we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="499.33" dur="5.91">seen it as of yet why because we</text>
  <text start="502.03" dur="5.34">explained how tariffs work you have many</text>
  <text start="505.24" dur="5.36">many middlemen before it actually hits</text>
  <text start="507.37" dur="7.35">the consumer the middlemen are absorbing</text>
  <text start="510.6" dur="6.819">the actual increase caused by the</text>
  <text start="514.72" dur="5.97">tariffs so if China is putting out an</text>
  <text start="517.419" dur="7.801">item that costs 22 cents and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="520.69" dur="7.47">10% tariff or 25% tariff on that 22 cent</text>
  <text start="525.22" dur="4.83">item it&amp;#39;s not that much that&amp;#39;s the first</text>
  <text start="528.16" dur="3.15">middle name and then it goes through</text>
  <text start="530.05" dur="3.33">another middlemen another another</text>
  <text start="531.31" dur="4.02">middleman and it finally hits the United</text>
  <text start="533.38" dur="4.5">States where then they sell that 22 2</text>
  <text start="535.33" dur="4.65">cent item for like 10 15 20 25 30</text>
  <text start="537.88" dur="4.44">dollars this is why you&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="539.98" dur="5.28">see anything Trump actually tweeted out</text>
  <text start="542.32" dur="4.74">the following China is subsidizing its</text>
  <text start="545.26" dur="4.29">product in order that it can continue to</text>
  <text start="547.06" dur="4.77">be sold in the US many firms are leaving</text>
  <text start="549.55" dur="4.17">China for other countries including the</text>
  <text start="551.83" dur="4.8">United States in order to avoid paying</text>
  <text start="553.72" dur="6.56">the tariffs no visible increase in costs</text>
  <text start="556.63" dur="6.89">or inflation but US is taking in</text>
  <text start="560.28" dur="7.65">billions now like we</text>
  <text start="563.52" dur="9.14">the entire plan here is to get the Fed</text>
  <text start="567.93" dur="8.64">to do what Trump wants and still look</text>
  <text start="572.66" dur="5.56">independent now last year Trump first</text>
  <text start="576.57" dur="3.36">raised the possibility that the Federal</text>
  <text start="578.22" dur="5.28">Reserve could cut interest rates</text>
  <text start="579.93" dur="6.659">everybody dismiss this as this crazy man</text>
  <text start="583.5" dur="5.13">talking about why would they lower rates</text>
  <text start="586.589" dur="4.861">when they&amp;#39;re raising rates right now it</text>
  <text start="588.63" dur="5.82">makes no sense he has no idea how the</text>
  <text start="591.45" dur="5.699">business is run it doesn&amp;#39;t work this way</text>
  <text start="594.45" dur="5.28">you just can&amp;#39;t tell the Fed to stop</text>
  <text start="597.149" dur="4.141">raising rates to keep rates steady then</text>
  <text start="599.73" dur="3.45">lower rates and start stimulus it</text>
  <text start="601.29" dur="3.51">doesn&amp;#39;t work this way because when the</text>
  <text start="603.18" dur="4.23">economy is doing well the numbers look</text>
  <text start="604.8" dur="5.099">great the Fed is going to do what they</text>
  <text start="607.41" dur="5.97">have to do and that is tighten and raise</text>
  <text start="609.899" dur="6.391">rates well of all those financial pun</text>
  <text start="613.38" dur="7.32">ins the mainstream media oh by the way</text>
  <text start="616.29" dur="6.57">they were wrong guess what he&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="620.7" dur="4.56">there again and he was an interview on</text>
  <text start="622.86" dur="4.95">Fox with Laura Ingraham and they were</text>
  <text start="625.26" dur="4.889">talking about the interest rates and how</text>
  <text start="627.81" dur="5.55">he wants the Fed to cut rates take a</text>
  <text start="630.149" dur="4.38">listen to what Trump says because you</text>
  <text start="633.36" dur="3.419">did want to have a better relationship</text>
  <text start="634.529" dur="4.081">if possible with Russia at the beginning</text>
  <text start="636.779" dur="2.941">of your term is that out the window now</text>
  <text start="638.61" dur="2.4">is it not going to have a good</text>
  <text start="639.72" dur="2.58">relationship with Russia</text>
  <text start="641.01" dur="3.09">I think it&amp;#39;s hurt by the phony</text>
  <text start="642.3" dur="4.2">witch-hunt you know I could have a good</text>
  <text start="644.1" dur="4.14">relationship with Russia again we have</text>
  <text start="646.5" dur="2.94">what everyone wants I built an economy</text>
  <text start="648.24" dur="3.93">that&amp;#39;s incredible</text>
  <text start="649.44" dur="4.709">we&amp;#39;re up 14 trillion dollars in value</text>
  <text start="652.17" dur="4.169">look at what&amp;#39;s going on with the stock</text>
  <text start="654.149" dur="3.81">market and this is despite a Federal</text>
  <text start="656.339" dur="3.211">Reserve that frankly should have had</text>
  <text start="657.959" dur="3.361">lower interest rates and everything else</text>
  <text start="659.55" dur="4.11">now there&amp;#39;s a safety net that&amp;#39;s good and</text>
  <text start="661.32" dur="5.269">it&amp;#39;s more conservative but if we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="663.66" dur="4.83">have all these interest rate you know I</text>
  <text start="666.589" dur="4.331">thought he was going to raise interest</text>
  <text start="668.49" dur="5.849">rates all but if we didn&amp;#39;t have that</text>
  <text start="670.92" dur="7.05">we&amp;#39;d be at 5.2 and the stock market</text>
  <text start="674.339" dur="5.551">would be up 10,000 points more but now</text>
  <text start="677.97" dur="4.26">we have a very conservative approach and</text>
  <text start="679.89" dur="5.01">we&amp;#39;re still we&amp;#39;ve created</text>
  <text start="682.23" dur="5.22">trillions of dollars in value and by the</text>
  <text start="684.9" dur="6.6">way China has lost trillions of dollars</text>
  <text start="687.45" dur="7.56">in value if somebody else let&amp;#39;s say yes</text>
  <text start="691.5" dur="6.26">what Trump is saying is that he wants</text>
  <text start="695.01" dur="8.07">the Fed to do exactly what it did for</text>
  <text start="697.76" dur="6.91">Obama and if they went ahead and they</text>

  <text start="756.42" dur="3.57">very easy to figure out because we know</text>
  <text start="758.52" dur="3.69">that this is a fake economy it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="767.97" dur="3.81">using stimulus and lowering rates it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="770.1" dur="3.51">going to implode the economy because</text>
  <text start="771.78" dur="4.38">they created the bubbles with stimulus</text>
  <text start="773.61" dur="5.07">and lowering the rates if they lower</text>
  <text start="776.16" dur="4.52">rates now and provide stimulus guess</text>

  <text start="794.13" dur="4.89">those economic articles and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="796.23" dur="6.21">that the stock market in the corporate</text>
  <text start="799.02" dur="5.52">bond market or in la-la-land pricing in</text>
  <text start="802.44" dur="5.01">an economic boom they&amp;#39;re not seeing a</text>
  <text start="804.54" dur="5.88">rate cut economy so why would the Fed</text>
  <text start="807.45" dur="5.28">right now and the probability of three</text>
  <text start="810.42" dur="5.609">or even four rate cuts by December 11th</text>
  <text start="812.73" dur="5.339">are now suddenly gaining the most favor</text>
  <text start="816.029" dur="4.201">in other words the market is betting</text>
  <text start="818.069" dur="3.781">there&amp;#39;s just a near zero chance</text>
  <text start="820.23" dur="3.779">the feds target for the federal funds</text>
  <text start="821.85" dur="4.77">rate will remain at the current range</text>
  <text start="824.009" dur="6.45">between two and a quarter and two and a</text>
  <text start="826.62" dur="6.149">half now you have to remember the stock</text>
  <text start="830.459" dur="4.92">market the bond market Wall Street</text>
  <text start="832.769" dur="4.771">everyone else thought the Fed was going</text>
  <text start="835.379" dur="5.221">to continually raise rates they never</text>
  <text start="837.54" dur="6.33">thought in their wildest dreams that the</text>
  <text start="840.6" dur="6.15">Fed was going to cut rates yes I know it</text>
  <text start="843.87" dur="3.659">hasn&amp;#39;t happened yet but guess what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="846.75" dur="4.319">coming</text>
  <text start="847.529" dur="6.721">they&amp;#39;ve already reversing their policy</text>
  <text start="851.069" dur="6.69">and now when you look at this you can</text>
  <text start="854.25" dur="6.24">see that the bet on two rate cuts has</text>
  <text start="857.759" dur="6.211">skyrocketed to 34% and this is before</text>
  <text start="860.49" dur="8.699">December 11th three rate cuts you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="863.97" dur="9.69">looking at 34% and what this means is is</text>
  <text start="869.189" dur="7.01">that Trump the Patriots they are now</text>
  <text start="873.66" dur="6.33">controlling they&amp;#39;re using the magic wand</text>
  <text start="876.199" dur="5.531">to control the economy Q&amp;#39;s told us that</text>
  <text start="879.99" dur="4.56">they understood it and they realized</text>
  <text start="881.73" dur="4.469">what the deep state what the central</text>
  <text start="884.55" dur="4.05">bank the bad people in the central bank</text>
  <text start="886.199" dur="4.231">were trying to do here they were trying</text>
  <text start="888.6" dur="3.959">to raise the rates as we saw as Trump</text>
  <text start="890.43" dur="3.719">came into his presidency and they were</text>
  <text start="892.559" dur="3.75">going to crash the economy right in the</text>
  <text start="894.149" dur="5.221">2020 election and the reason for this is</text>
  <text start="896.309" dur="6.14">because if they crash the economy during</text>
  <text start="899.37" dur="5.25">this period of time they know that</text>
  <text start="902.449" dur="4.481">everyone would look at Trump and say you</text>
  <text start="904.62" dur="5.699">just ruin the economy we&amp;#39;re not voting</text>
  <text start="906.93" dur="5.159">for you this is why Q Patriots Trump</text>

  <text start="912.089" dur="4.5">over this this is part of the plan they</text>
  <text start="915.12" dur="3.689">can&amp;#39;t get rid of the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="916.589" dur="4.05">right now they can&amp;#39;t get rid of anything</text>

  <text start="934.92" dur="4.709">setting it up Trump is saying listen if</text>
  <text start="937.529" dur="4.441">the Fed would just do this the economy</text>
  <text start="939.629" dur="5.721">would be a better off so he&amp;#39;s showing</text>

  <text start="949.71" dur="3.9">and he said I made the economy great up</text>
  <text start="952.23" dur="5.13">to this point but if the Fed just did</text>
