  <text start="67.85" dur="6.3">transition is now being pushed let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="72.38" dur="4.68">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="74.15" dur="5.34">news now we&amp;#39;ve been tracking and</text>
  <text start="77.06" dur="4.89">following the retail industry we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="79.49" dur="4.8">following it showing how the retail</text>
  <text start="81.95" dur="3.48">market is completely falling apart and I</text>
  <text start="84.29" dur="2.55">know there&amp;#39;s people out there saying</text>
  <text start="85.43" dur="3.9">well everything&amp;#39;s moving to online sales</text>
  <text start="86.84" dur="5.16">yes online sales are picking up but</text>
  <text start="89.33" dur="4.98">again this is a very big business and it</text>
  <text start="92" dur="5.97">doesn&amp;#39;t explain why restaurant traffic</text>
  <text start="94.31" dur="6.12">is declining those stores that just sell</text>
  <text start="97.97" dur="3.84">food and other things are declining and</text>
  <text start="100.43" dur="5.939">believe me everyone is not buying their</text>
  <text start="101.81" dur="7.26">food online and why are the discount</text>
  <text start="106.369" dur="6.961">shops doing a lot better why are they</text>
  <text start="109.07" dur="7.049">popping up that is because people are</text>
  <text start="113.33" dur="6.14">not making as much money people are</text>
  <text start="116.119" dur="6.151">losing their jobs and they can&amp;#39;t afford</text>
  <text start="119.47" dur="6.82">the expensive merchandise they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="122.27" dur="6.54">looking for discounts this is why Macy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="126.29" dur="6.03">decided to go in a completely different</text>
  <text start="128.81" dur="5.19">direction I mean think about it they</text>
  <text start="132.32" dur="2.759">have an online presence why didn&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="134" dur="3.6">say listen we&amp;#39;re gonna be closed in one</text>
  <text start="135.079" dur="5.341">our stores and we&amp;#39;re gonna just sell</text>
  <text start="137.6" dur="4.109">online just like Amazon and this way we</text>
  <text start="140.42" dur="8.45">can reduce our cost and it&amp;#39;ll be great</text>
  <text start="141.709" dur="11.961">no they decided let&amp;#39;s push forth a store</text>
  <text start="148.87" dur="8.79">that is discounted call backstage now</text>
  <text start="153.67" dur="7.18">backstage is going to be like TJ Maxx</text>
  <text start="157.66" dur="5.26">Nordstrom Rack and it&amp;#39;s going to sell</text>
  <text start="160.85" dur="5.07">Macy&amp;#39;s brands at steeply discounted</text>
  <text start="162.92" dur="6.18">prices up to 80% off hmm think about</text>
  <text start="165.92" dur="5.49">this for a second why are they doing</text>
  <text start="169.1" dur="5.28">this they&amp;#39;re opening a brick-and-mortar</text>
  <text start="171.41" dur="5.91">store but it&amp;#39;s going to be a discount</text>
  <text start="174.38" dur="5.19">store the reason for this is because</text>
  <text start="177.32" dur="4.74">they are realizing and they&amp;#39;re never</text>
  <text start="179.57" dur="4.169">going to admit this is that the American</text>
  <text start="182.06" dur="3.87">people they just don&amp;#39;t have the funds to</text>
  <text start="183.739" dur="3.691">go out and purchase the expensive items</text>
  <text start="185.93" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re looking for discounts</text>
  <text start="187.43" dur="6.119">yes they want the nice merchandise but</text>
  <text start="191.48" dur="4.92">they don&amp;#39;t want to pay the obscene</text>
  <text start="193.549" dur="5.421">prices and this is why you see a lot of</text>
  <text start="196.4" dur="6.36">discount stores starting to open up and</text>
  <text start="198.97" dur="5.68">they&amp;#39;re starting to overtake the regular</text>
  <text start="202.76" dur="4.14">stores where they&amp;#39;re selling everything</text>
  <text start="204.65" dur="3.3">at the high prices if you actually look</text>
  <text start="206.9" dur="3.72">at the stores that have been closing</text>
  <text start="207.95" dur="6.45">down these are all the high-priced</text>
  <text start="210.62" dur="5.67">retailers and the people they are saying</text>
  <text start="214.4" dur="4.919">listen we can&amp;#39;t afford you anymore</text>
  <text start="216.29" dur="5.849">we can&amp;#39;t go out and pay those prices</text>
  <text start="219.319" dur="3.961">even online when you go to Amazon</text>
  <text start="222.139" dur="2.701">sometimes they don&amp;#39;t have always have</text>
  <text start="223.28" dur="3.15">the lowest prices and a lot of times</text>
  <text start="224.84" dur="3.6">you&amp;#39;re looking to say you know I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="226.43" dur="5.729">gonna pay that I&amp;#39;m gonna go someplace</text>
  <text start="228.44" dur="6.449">else because I&amp;#39;m not going to pay that</text>
  <text start="232.159" dur="4.41">amount it&amp;#39;s too high and you can find</text>
  <text start="234.889" dur="3.871">the same exact thing someplace else a</text>
  <text start="236.569" dur="3.931">little bit cheaper sometimes Amazon does</text>
  <text start="238.76" dur="3.78">have a cheaper and you purchase it from</text>
  <text start="240.5" dur="4.769">there and it&amp;#39;s not because oh I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="242.54" dur="4.529">gonna shop online your people are</text>
  <text start="245.269" dur="3.42">looking for the cheapest price and this</text>
  <text start="247.069" dur="3.721">is why we&amp;#39;re starting a lot to see a lot</text>
  <text start="248.689" dur="4.2">of these discount stores starting to</text>
  <text start="250.79" dur="3.69">open up because retailers are starting</text>
  <text start="252.889" dur="3.451">to realize what&amp;#39;s going on now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="254.48" dur="3.08">never going to admit that the economy is</text>
  <text start="256.34" dur="4.139">doing poorly</text>
  <text start="257.56" dur="6.97">they&amp;#39;re never gonna say hey the economy</text>
  <text start="260.479" dur="5.94">is you know doing terribly this is why</text>
  <text start="264.53" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;re opening up discount stores this is</text>
  <text start="266.419" dur="4.201">why we&amp;#39;re closing our expensive stores</text>
  <text start="268.13" dur="4.469">and this is the way everything is moving</text>
  <text start="270.62" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re not going to say this but you</text>
  <text start="272.599" dur="5.13">could see right now they are following</text>
  <text start="274.28" dur="6">the trend we see the housing market is a</text>
  <text start="277.729" dur="4.41">complete and utter disaster we see</text>
  <text start="280.28" dur="3.449">existing home sales they have</text>
  <text start="282.139" dur="3.84">disappointed pending home sales have</text>
  <text start="283.729" dur="4.891">just collapsed this is the lowest since</text>
  <text start="285.979" dur="5.43">October 2014 and we see right now</text>
  <text start="288.62" dur="6.09">pending home sales they plunge by 4.7</text>
  <text start="291.409" dur="5.73">percent in January below the point 5</text>
  <text start="294.71" dur="5.429">percent expected rise in sales this is</text>
  <text start="297.139" dur="5.52">the biggest drop since May of 2010 and</text>
  <text start="300.139" dur="4.081">the National Association of Realtors are</text>
  <text start="302.659" dur="3.931">out there trying to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="304.22" dur="4.47">convince all the homebuyers that and</text>
  <text start="306.59" dur="6.15">sellers that this is nothing but an</text>
  <text start="308.69" dur="7.02">inventory issue but that&amp;#39;s not what it</text>
  <text start="312.74" dur="4.89">is the everyday person is sitting on the</text>
  <text start="315.71" dur="4.41">sidelines the everyday person doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="317.63" dur="3.65">want to spend the high prices in retail</text>
  <text start="320.12" dur="3.92">that&amp;#39;s why they go into discs</text>
  <text start="321.28" dur="4.95">stores the everyday person doesn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="324.04" dur="3.599">to go and spend a lot of money on the</text>
  <text start="326.23" dur="3.12">home because they just can&amp;#39;t afford it</text>
  <text start="327.639" dur="4.021">they can&amp;#39;t get a mortgage and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="329.35" dur="4.83">make those payments this is what is</text>
  <text start="331.66" dur="4.56">really happening right now and we can</text>
  <text start="334.18" dur="4.92">see right now as interest rates start to</text>
  <text start="336.22" dur="5.1">rise as they are rising this is going to</text>
  <text start="339.1" dur="5.16">be a bloodbath and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="341.32" dur="4.44">the Fed wants to raise rates once again</text>
  <text start="344.26" dur="7.1">actually they&amp;#39;re talking about four more</text>
  <text start="345.76" dur="9.81">times this is a recipe for a disaster</text>
  <text start="351.36" dur="5.98">we&amp;#39;ve seen this before back in 2006 2007</text>
  <text start="355.57" dur="4.41">when they started to raise the rates</text>
  <text start="357.34" dur="4.47">housing started to decline everything</text>
  <text start="359.98" dur="3.72">started to fall apart then they lowered</text>
  <text start="361.81" dur="3.48">the rates very quickly this is exactly</text>
  <text start="363.7" dur="5.4">what they&amp;#39;re doing they follow the same</text>
  <text start="365.29" dur="5.7">exact steps over and over and over we</text>
  <text start="369.1" dur="5.1">saw already that the fourth quarter GDP</text>
  <text start="370.99" dur="5.55">yesterday we mentioned it where they</text>
  <text start="374.2" dur="3.51">lowered it from 5.2 percent all the way</text>
  <text start="376.54" dur="2.61">down to 2.6 percent</text>
  <text start="377.71" dur="3.75">well they lowered it even further down</text>
  <text start="379.15" dur="3.72">to 2.5 percent and I believe it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="381.46" dur="3.24">to drop even further now of course</text>
  <text start="382.87" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re gonna manipulate it later on</text>
  <text start="384.7" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re gonna make it look like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="385.96" dur="4.769">much much higher than that and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="388.03" dur="4.949">gonna we&amp;#39;ll look at the numbers at that</text>
  <text start="390.729" dur="4.351">time to see what they&amp;#39;ve done to push</text>
  <text start="392.979" dur="4.111">this up and then after you know a month</text>
  <text start="395.08" dur="3.99">or two they&amp;#39;ll go back and revise those</text>
  <text start="397.09" dur="4.61">numbers back lower where they were and</text>
  <text start="399.07" dur="7.8">we could see right now the economy is</text>
  <text start="401.7" dur="9.15">not doing as well as everyone really</text>
  <text start="406.87" dur="6.84">thinks it is we are in a gigantic</text>
  <text start="410.85" dur="6.819">illusion the biggest illusion that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="413.71" dur="6.51">ever seen in our lives and the central</text>
  <text start="417.669" dur="6.151">bankers government they figured out a</text>
  <text start="420.22" dur="7.29">way how to keep everyone in this</text>
  <text start="423.82" dur="6.69">illusion by manipulating everything and</text>
  <text start="427.51" dur="5.79">if you go back in time they were able to</text>
  <text start="430.51" dur="5.04">manipulate certain things that well they</text>
  <text start="433.3" dur="4.56">figured out through quantitative easing</text>
  <text start="435.55" dur="5.28">through manipulation of interest rates</text>
  <text start="437.86" dur="4.92">manipulation of GDP numbers manipulation</text>
  <text start="440.83" dur="3.93">of unemployment numbers manipulation of</text>
  <text start="442.78" dur="4.199">the stock market manipulation of the</text>
  <text start="444.76" dur="4.71">precious metals market manipulation of</text>
  <text start="446.979" dur="6.721">every single thing guess what</text>
  <text start="449.47" dur="5.37">they created the illusion the reason why</text>
  <text start="453.7" dur="2.58">they created this a</text>
  <text start="454.84" dur="3.96">illusion and they had to keep it going</text>
  <text start="456.28" dur="8.79">for so long it&amp;#39;s because this is the end</text>
  <text start="458.8" dur="10.8">game this is the last part of the Fiat</text>
  <text start="465.07" dur="5.97">system it is at its end stages and this</text>
  <text start="469.6" dur="3.9">is what they do when they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="471.04" dur="5.04">ready to transition now I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="473.5" dur="5.34">talking about this where we&amp;#39;re going in</text>
  <text start="476.08" dur="5.43">two different directions here we see the</text>
  <text start="478.84" dur="4.859">report from the SEC where Bank of</text>
  <text start="481.51" dur="4.14">America said that cryptocurrencies is a</text>
  <text start="483.699" dur="3.931">threat to their business JP Morgan came</text>
  <text start="485.65" dur="3.84">out and said yes same exact thing threat</text>
  <text start="487.63" dur="5.46">to our business we don&amp;#39;t like it</text>
  <text start="489.49" dur="8.1">whatsoever they don&amp;#39;t like it because it</text>
  <text start="493.09" dur="8.52">goes against their Fiat system their</text>
  <text start="497.59" dur="6.329">currency system and if people go the</text>
  <text start="501.61" dur="4.59">cryptocurrency route you don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="503.919" dur="4.081">these banks there&amp;#39;s no reason for them</text>
  <text start="506.2" dur="4.67">actually most of them are money</text>
  <text start="508" dur="5.81">laundering operations most of them are</text>
  <text start="510.87" dur="6.609">complete criminal enterprises and</text>
  <text start="513.81" dur="5.68">actually when the time comes and we see</text>
  <text start="517.479" dur="3.93">what is really going on we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="519.49" dur="3.239">that all these different banks and all</text>
  <text start="521.409" dur="3.661">these different structures part of the</text>
  <text start="522.729" dur="5.011">central bank well it&amp;#39;s one gigantic</text>
  <text start="525.07" dur="4.29">criminal enterprise now the central</text>
  <text start="527.74" dur="3.78">bankers the deeps a they they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="529.36" dur="5.099">given up and we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="531.52" dur="5.28">transitions going to be going in two</text>
  <text start="534.459" dur="4.801">different directions and where we end up</text>
  <text start="536.8" dur="4.71">well that all depends because we see US</text>
  <text start="539.26" dur="6.63">Treasury Secretary Steve manoosh in</text>
  <text start="541.51" dur="8.76">right now is out there saying listen we</text>
  <text start="545.89" dur="9.6">are still up to joining and returning to</text>
  <text start="550.27" dur="6.75">the TPP now remember they want and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="555.49" dur="3.84">talking about the central bankers those</text>
  <text start="557.02" dur="5.069">people who want a one-world type of</text>
  <text start="559.33" dur="4.32">government they want the TPP and a lot</text>
  <text start="562.089" dur="2.301">of people don&amp;#39;t understand what I mean</text>
  <text start="563.65" dur="3.87">by this</text>
  <text start="564.39" dur="6.25">remember the TPP this is something that</text>
  <text start="567.52" dur="6.3">Trump shot down minuchin I don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="570.64" dur="4.319">is part of the Trump team he&amp;#39;s a deep</text>
  <text start="573.82" dur="4.019">state operative</text>
  <text start="574.959" dur="4.771">he&amp;#39;s a goldman sachs boy and we can see</text>
  <text start="577.839" dur="3.361">right now that every time he comes out</text>
  <text start="579.73" dur="4.32">with something Trump comes out and</text>
  <text start="581.2" dur="5.43">corrects him I think what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="584.05" dur="4.27">to do is they&amp;#39;re trying to push the idea</text>
  <text start="586.63" dur="3.04">of the TPP once</text>
  <text start="588.32" dur="3.54">this is what they do in the corporate</text>
  <text start="589.67" dur="3.659">media when they want something done they</text>
  <text start="591.86" dur="3.87">have these individuals come out and they</text>
  <text start="593.329" dur="4.771">start to tell you what they want and</text>
  <text start="595.73" dur="5.969">this is exactly what they want because</text>
  <text start="598.1" dur="6">remember that he PP was supposed to put</text>
  <text start="601.699" dur="4.021">a court system above the government</text>
  <text start="604.1" dur="4.08">entity in every single one of the</text>
  <text start="605.72" dur="6.51">countries and the court system would</text>
  <text start="608.18" dur="7.409">overrule every single government plus</text>
  <text start="612.23" dur="6.029">the TPP was prepping the United States</text>
  <text start="615.589" dur="5.071">to become a third world country they</text>
  <text start="618.259" dur="3.901">were bringing in a lot of these illegal</text>
  <text start="620.66" dur="3.21">immigrants welp there were many</text>
  <text start="622.16" dur="3.83">different agendas associated with this</text>
  <text start="623.87" dur="5.19">one of them was that they needed</text>
  <text start="625.99" dur="6.31">low-paying workers here in this country</text>
  <text start="629.06" dur="6.149">why because when it you set up a</text>
  <text start="632.3" dur="5.519">one-world government a transition into</text>
  <text start="635.209" dur="5.19">this type of an economy you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="637.819" dur="4.71">the United States you know at this level</text>
  <text start="640.399" dur="4.74">and another country at a much much lower</text>
  <text start="642.529" dur="5.461">level you bring all the countries to the</text>
  <text start="645.139" dur="4.231">same level now we know that all the hook</text>
  <text start="647.99" dur="2.579">countries aren&amp;#39;t going to come up to the</text>
  <text start="649.37" dur="3.36">United States level so what they had to</text>
  <text start="650.569" dur="4.64">do is they have to bring the United</text>
  <text start="652.73" dur="5.49">States down to all the other countries</text>
  <text start="655.209" dur="5.38">level that&amp;#39;s what they were planning to</text>
  <text start="658.22" dur="5.82">do to make them to make everyone on an</text>
  <text start="660.589" dur="5.25">even playing field which means the way</text>
  <text start="664.04" dur="4.83">of life in the United States would</text>
  <text start="665.839" dur="6.69">completely change into a third world</text>
  <text start="668.87" dur="5.82">type of lifestyle because they would</text>
  <text start="672.529" dur="4.5">bring in workers from other countries</text>
  <text start="674.69" dur="4.55">and they would pay them the same amount</text>
  <text start="677.029" dur="4.651">they were making in their countries and</text>
  <text start="679.24" dur="3.82">vice-versa so everyone would get the</text>
  <text start="681.68" dur="3.18">same pay no matter where you go and it&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="683.06" dur="4.98">be the very it would be the bottom of</text>
  <text start="684.86" dur="7.26">the barrel type of pay this is their</text>
  <text start="688.04" dur="7.77">plan with the TPP this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="692.12" dur="6.269">they wanted and of course it was stopped</text>
  <text start="695.81" dur="3.81">but they&amp;#39;re here once again trying to</text>
  <text start="698.389" dur="3.421">push this because they understand</text>
  <text start="699.62" dur="4.92">everything is starting to fall apart and</text>
  <text start="701.81" dur="4.74">they do believe that this is this is</text>
  <text start="704.54" dur="3.989">their chance to push their agenda</text>
  <text start="706.55" dur="5.909">remember they never give up on their</text>
  <text start="708.529" dur="8.731">goal and they want this to happen here</text>
  <text start="712.459" dur="7.081">so we have a transition that is</text>
  <text start="717.26" dur="3.94">happening right now right in front of</text>
  <text start="719.54" dur="3.76">our faces</text>
  <text start="721.2" dur="5.73">and we&amp;#39;re gonna go in either direction</text>
  <text start="723.3" dur="5.159">with the central bankers now of course</text>
  <text start="726.93" dur="3">they convinced the corporate media to</text>
  <text start="728.459" dur="3.211">push this they convinced the American</text>
  <text start="729.93" dur="2.52">people this is the great the best thing</text>
  <text start="731.67" dur="2.969">since sliced bread</text>
  <text start="732.45" dur="4.71">people might go along with it then we</text>
  <text start="734.639" dur="4.32">have the crypto market which is a people</text>
  <text start="737.16" dur="3.869">currency not controlled by the central</text>
  <text start="738.959" dur="4.201">banks actually would destroy the central</text>
  <text start="741.029" dur="5.401">banking system it would destroy the</text>
  <text start="743.16" dur="5.91">entire banking system and it would allow</text>
  <text start="746.43" dur="5.31">the people to take control of their</text>
  <text start="749.07" dur="5.069">economy now of course they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="751.74" dur="3.63">this this is why JPMorgan Chase Bank of</text>
  <text start="754.139" dur="3.031">America and other banks are saying that</text>
  <text start="755.37" dur="5.76">this is a threat to their system</text>
  <text start="757.17" dur="8.219">remember their business their system not</text>
  <text start="761.13" dur="5.94">yours not mine their system</text>
  <text start="765.389" dur="4.021">remember they make a lot of money on</text>
  <text start="767.07" dur="3.959">this system central banks make a lot of</text>
  <text start="769.41" dur="5.76">money its outset that&amp;#39;s how it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="771.029" dur="6.331">designed so they make a lot of money and</text>
  <text start="775.17" dur="5.55">when I say money I don&amp;#39;t mean the</text>
  <text start="777.36" dur="6.9">printed dollars I mean real assets they</text>
  <text start="780.72" dur="6.72">steal real assets so here we are we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="784.26" dur="5.519">in this transition minuchin is making</text>
  <text start="787.44" dur="5.91">the play right now trying to push the</text>
  <text start="789.779" dur="6.601">TPP and we can see at this point they</text>
  <text start="793.35" dur="5.849">understand that we&amp;#39;re heading towards</text>
  <text start="796.38" dur="5.97">this fork in the road and they want</text>
  <text start="799.199" dur="5.481">everyone moved to where they want</text>
  <text start="802.35" dur="4.89">everyone to go they want their</text>
  <text start="804.68" dur="4.779">transition and this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="807.24" dur="5.61">trying to do right now so we can see at</text>
  <text start="809.459" dur="5.521">this point that we are at the end stage</text>
  <text start="812.85" dur="4.2">of this economic system this is why they</text>
  <text start="814.98" dur="3.99">created the illusion this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="817.05" dur="3.33">been keeping the illusion alive this is</text>
  <text start="818.97" dur="4.71">why they&amp;#39;ve been pushing their agenda</text>
  <text start="820.38" dur="7.11">this is why they want the TPP this is</text>
  <text start="823.68" dur="6.57">why they want everyone convinced that</text>
  <text start="827.49" dur="6.5">when the economy finally come and</text>
  <text start="830.25" dur="7.41">completely crashes it&amp;#39;s not their fault</text>
  <text start="833.99" dur="6.909">this will allow them to start up a new</text>
  <text start="837.66" dur="5.4">system but crypto currencies well</text>
  <text start="840.899" dur="5.911">that was introduced into this whole</text>
  <text start="843.06" dur="5.37">entire economic arena and now they&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="846.81" dur="5.25">little bit worried and I think it was</text>
  <text start="848.43" dur="6.3">introduced on purpose to throw a wrench</text>
  <text start="852.06" dur="6.57">in the whole entire thing here</text>
  <text start="854.73" dur="7.02">to give the people a chance and we can</text>
  <text start="858.63" dur="5.579">see right now the only reason the banks</text>
  <text start="861.75" dur="5.55">would say that crypto currencies are a</text>
  <text start="864.209" dur="6.331">threat is because they understand what</text>
  <text start="867.3" dur="6.27">will happen if the people decide to</text>
  <text start="870.54" dur="5.609">choose cryptocurrency and say we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="873.57" dur="5.25">want the central bank anymore they</text>
  <text start="876.149" dur="5.94">understand and they know that if this</text>
  <text start="878.82" dur="4.769">happens they are finished and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="882.089" dur="5.31">gonna do whatever they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="883.589" dur="5.701">stop that at but no matter what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="887.399" dur="3.781">going through some type of transition</text>
  <text start="889.29" dur="3.81">this is why you have to be ready and</text>
