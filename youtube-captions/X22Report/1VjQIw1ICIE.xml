  <text start="116.619" dur="3.841">saying it&amp;#39;s doing remember a lot of the</text>
  <text start="118.54" dur="5.31">manufacturing has been moved overseas</text>

  <text start="146.83" dur="5.49">fifty four point six to fifty three</text>
  <text start="148.72" dur="6.15">point nine as new order slowed and we</text>
  <text start="152.32" dur="5.61">see inflation is also ticking up right</text>
  <text start="154.87" dur="5.46">now and at this point what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="157.93" dur="4.35">is everything well it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="160.33" dur="5.25">deteriorate just like we thought now</text>
  <text start="162.28" dur="7.65">this temporary bump is all coming down</text>
  <text start="165.58" dur="5.7">right now and as we head into 2018 we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="169.93" dur="4.38">gonna start to see a lot of things</text>
  <text start="171.28" dur="4.86">completely fall apart and there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="174.31" dur="2.97">to be nothing that the central bank</text>
  <text start="176.14" dur="3.18">could do there&amp;#39;s gonna be nothing that</text>
  <text start="177.28" dur="3.75">the government can do because the real</text>
  <text start="179.32" dur="4.11">economy behind the scenes and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="181.03" dur="4.5">talking about behind the manipulated</text>

  <text start="200.2" dur="5.22">numbers at us and it wasn&amp;#39;t as bad at as</text>
  <text start="203.02" dur="6.24">it is today but it was pretty darn bad</text>
  <text start="205.42" dur="6.42">and it fell apart behind the scenes we</text>
  <text start="209.26" dur="6.69">are seeing the same exact thing now</text>
  <text start="211.84" dur="7.05">right now we are on a bubble watch why</text>
  <text start="215.95" dur="5.39">are we are why are we on a bubble watch</text>
  <text start="218.89" dur="5.16">well it&amp;#39;s because the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="221.34" dur="6.1">what they have done with ZURB and QE</text>
  <text start="224.05" dur="6.27">they forced all risk in the financial</text>
  <text start="227.44" dur="5.52">system to adjust lower remember in a</text>
  <text start="230.32" dur="5.61">fighh at base monetary system such as</text>
  <text start="232.96" dur="5.46">the one that were in today sovereign</text>
  <text start="235.93" dur="5.22">bonds not gold are the ultimate backs up</text>
  <text start="238.42" dur="4.32">Vernon for the financial system and for</text>
  <text start="241.15" dur="3.84">the US which controls the reserve</text>
  <text start="242.74" dur="3.9">currency of the world sovereign bonds</text>
  <text start="244.99" dur="3.81">also called Treasuries represent the</text>
  <text start="246.64" dur="5.04">risk-free rate of return for the entire</text>
  <text start="248.8" dur="5.19">world so when the Fed moved to corner</text>
  <text start="251.68" dur="5.73">the market forcing the yields on these</text>
  <text start="253.99" dur="5.76">bonds to drop to all-time lows it was</text>
  <text start="257.41" dur="4.62">effectively forcing all risk in the US</text>
  <text start="259.75" dur="6.24">financial system to adjust to an</text>
  <text start="262.03" dur="6.57">abnormal risk profile the Fed created a</text>
  <text start="265.99" dur="6.45">bubble in bonds which in turn fueled a</text>
  <text start="268.6" dur="6.12">bubble in everything and we mean</text>
  <text start="272.44" dur="6.42">everything corporate bonds municipal</text>
  <text start="274.72" dur="8.19">bonds stocks even consumer credit and we</text>
  <text start="278.86" dur="6.3">see nine years into this crazy economy</text>
  <text start="282.91" dur="5.58">that they created we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="285.16" dur="9.11">all of these bubbles and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="288.49" dur="8.85">seeing is that there&amp;#39;s a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="294.27" dur="5.92">margin debt and it has reached levels</text>
  <text start="297.34" dur="6.72">greater than ever before now what is</text>
  <text start="300.19" dur="7.05">margin debt well margin debt is money</text>
  <text start="304.06" dur="6.57">that stock investors borrow in order to</text>
  <text start="307.24" dur="7.04">buy stocks and it is direct leverage and</text>
  <text start="310.63" dur="6.599">it just hit a new record high of a 561</text>
  <text start="314.28" dur="6.04">billion dollars now to put this number</text>
  <text start="317.229" dur="8.401">into perspective it is equal to</text>
  <text start="320.32" dur="6.81">the entire economy of Taiwan nearly</text>
  <text start="325.63" dur="3.24">greater than the amount of margin debt</text>
  <text start="327.13" dur="5.94">borrowed at the peak of the last bubble</text>
  <text start="328.87" dur="6.71">in 2007 double the amount of margin debt</text>
  <text start="333.07" dur="8.49">borrowed at the peak of the tech bubble</text>
  <text start="335.58" dur="9.46">so we are at the point where this bubble</text>
  <text start="341.56" dur="5.4">this everything bubble well it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="345.04" dur="4.32">to pop and it&amp;#39;s going to be a disaster</text>
  <text start="346.96" dur="4.44">and we know it&amp;#39;s going to be disaster</text>
  <text start="349.36" dur="3.51">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking the economy we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="351.4" dur="3.96">been tracking everything that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="352.87" dur="5.22">going on and we&amp;#39;ve been watching</text>
  <text start="355.36" dur="4.17">everything deteriorate yes the</text>
  <text start="358.09" dur="3.15">government the Fed they&amp;#39;re very good at</text>
  <text start="359.53" dur="3.09">manipulating the numbers making us</text>
  <text start="361.24" dur="3.09">believe that everything is great the</text>
  <text start="362.62" dur="3.15">corporate media is out there and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="364.33" dur="3.18">been doing it for the last many many</text>
  <text start="365.77" dur="4.11">years telling us how great everything is</text>
  <text start="367.51" dur="6.33">well they did this back prior to the</text>
  <text start="369.88" dur="6.24">crash of 2008 2009 where no one saw</text>
  <text start="373.84" dur="3.42">anything coming not even the Fed of</text>
  <text start="376.12" dur="4.95">course they knew it was coming</text>
  <text start="377.26" dur="6.78">they were just pretending keeping us in</text>
  <text start="381.07" dur="4.86">an illusion and there are other</text>
  <text start="384.04" dur="2.88">countries that know that something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="385.93" dur="3.57">coming this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="386.92" dur="4.62">purchasing gold this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="389.5" dur="4.71">duplicating everything because they know</text>
  <text start="391.54" dur="5.52">that this system cannot last forever</text>
  <text start="394.21" dur="7.2">now Russia right now they are planning</text>
  <text start="397.06" dur="7.62">their first-ever sale of yuyuan bonds</text>
  <text start="401.41" dur="7.14">and the sale has been under discussion</text>
  <text start="404.68" dur="6.33">since US and European sanctions in 2014</text>
  <text start="408.55" dur="6.42">and we see right now that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="411.01" dur="8.1">to be issuing about six billion yuan</text>
  <text start="414.97" dur="6.84">bonds in a five-year note and we see</text>
  <text start="419.11" dur="5.49">right now they&amp;#39;re taking precautions the</text>
  <text start="421.81" dur="6.63">Bank of England right now is warning</text>
  <text start="424.6" dur="6.6">that if they continually borrow more</text>
  <text start="428.44" dur="5.13">currency they&amp;#39;re gonna end up like</text>
  <text start="431.2" dur="3.84">Venezuela now this is coming from a</text>
  <text start="433.57" dur="3.24">senior bank official warned that the</text>
  <text start="435.04" dur="4.86">UK&amp;#39;s economy would be unlikely to</text>
  <text start="436.81" dur="6.06">survive borrowing any more cash the</text>
  <text start="439.9" dur="3.98">government borrowing is getting out of</text>
  <text start="442.87" dur="3.41">hand</text>
  <text start="443.88" dur="4.99">Richard sharp a member of the bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="446.28" dur="5.29">financial stability committee claimed an</text>
  <text start="448.87" dur="5.22">extra one trillion had already been</text>
  <text start="451.57" dur="4.92">borrowed since 2008 financial crisis</text>
  <text start="454.09" dur="5.46">and if they borrow anymore it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="456.49" dur="5.07">lead to a disaster well it just doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="459.55" dur="4.14">go for the UK it goes for pretty much</text>
  <text start="461.56" dur="5.46">every other country out there that can</text>
  <text start="463.69" dur="5.16">borrow and most of them can borrow from</text>
  <text start="467.02" dur="3.869">the ECB the United States has the</text>
  <text start="468.85" dur="3.69">ability to create their own currency and</text>
  <text start="470.889" dur="4.201">of course then they have to borrow it</text>
  <text start="472.54" dur="4.68">from the Fed and we see we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="475.09" dur="5.549">down a path where things are going to</text>
  <text start="477.22" dur="6.18">break apart and collapse because this</text>
  <text start="480.639" dur="5.161">debt cannot be sustained now there&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="483.4" dur="5.46">thing that the central banks are very</text>
  <text start="485.8" dur="5.58">worried about actually - one if the</text>
  <text start="488.86" dur="3.84">entire system collapses without some</text>
  <text start="491.38" dur="3.24">type of distraction and they&amp;#39;re blamed</text>
  <text start="492.7" dur="5.52">for it well they&amp;#39;re afraid of that</text>
  <text start="494.62" dur="6.78">they&amp;#39;re also afraid of another currency</text>
  <text start="498.22" dur="5.52">that competes against theirs because if</text>
  <text start="501.4" dur="4.889">they can&amp;#39;t control countries with their</text>
  <text start="503.74" dur="4.98">currency by putting them into debt well</text>
  <text start="506.289" dur="4.621">they lost their control and one of these</text>
  <text start="508.72" dur="3.66">things is called crypto currencies we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="510.91" dur="9.629">all heard of it by now</text>
  <text start="512.38" dur="11.19">Bitcoin litecoin aetherium - and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="520.539" dur="6.151">many others there&amp;#39;s thousands so the</text>
  <text start="523.57" dur="5.25">BRIC countries right now they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="526.69" dur="4.16">okay we need to set up some type of</text>
  <text start="528.82" dur="5.16">regulations for crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="530.85" dur="5.89">because there&amp;#39;s about 3,000 different</text>
  <text start="533.98" dur="4.53">crypto currencies and there&amp;#39;s no common</text>
  <text start="536.74" dur="5.07">understanding of how to regulate their</text>
  <text start="538.51" dur="5.07">turnover so the BRICS have agreed to</text>
  <text start="541.81" dur="3.63">form a working group that will deal with</text>
  <text start="543.58" dur="3.54">illegal regulations of crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="545.44" dur="4.29">and they&amp;#39;re creating an international</text>
  <text start="547.12" dur="5.64">working group that will develop a common</text>
  <text start="549.73" dur="4.229">approach to control crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="552.76" dur="4.14">that&amp;#39;s basically what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="553.959" dur="5.161">because they want to tax the crypto</text>
  <text start="556.9" dur="5.97">currencies now the question is what is a</text>
  <text start="559.12" dur="5.79">cryptocurrency it is is it a service is</text>
  <text start="562.87" dur="4.98">it a means of payment is it a commodity</text>
  <text start="564.91" dur="6.869">every day everybody wants to use it but</text>
  <text start="567.85" dur="5.22">the legal definition is really not clear</text>
  <text start="571.779" dur="3.301">right now and I know the Fed is out</text>
  <text start="573.07" dur="4.38">there and the IRS is out there say no</text>
  <text start="575.08" dur="4.29">this is a commodity but other countries</text>
  <text start="577.45" dur="5.07">are saying well we don&amp;#39;t know that this</text>
  <text start="579.37" dur="5.37">is actually a commodity and the central</text>
  <text start="582.52" dur="5.43">banks right now they&amp;#39;re out there and</text>
  <text start="584.74" dur="7.44">they&amp;#39;re warning and the Fed is warning</text>
  <text start="587.95" dur="8.2">digital currencies could pose a serious</text>
  <text start="592.18" dur="7.15">financial stability issue and what</text>
  <text start="596.15" dur="8.69">they&amp;#39;re saying is that these digital</text>
  <text start="599.33" dur="8.04">currencies could overtake their</text>
  <text start="604.84" dur="5.26">currencies and what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="607.37" dur="4.56">about the central banks they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="610.1" dur="3.51">that well when you look at the crypto</text>
  <text start="611.93" dur="3.99">currencies there&amp;#39;s a lot of drawbacks I</text>
  <text start="613.61" dur="4.65">mean there&amp;#39;s nothing backing it these</text>
  <text start="615.92" dur="4.44">are just created out of thin air now</text>
  <text start="618.26" dur="3.72">wait a minute the central banks are</text>
  <text start="620.36" dur="4.32">saying that these are created out of</text>
  <text start="621.98" dur="5.7">thin air and there&amp;#39;s nothing back isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="624.68" dur="6.36">this what they do I mean think about</text>
  <text start="627.68" dur="5.25">what they&amp;#39;re saying right now and what</text>
  <text start="631.04" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re really trying to say here is</text>
  <text start="632.93" dur="4.56">that they see that the growth of the</text>
  <text start="635.27" dur="5.01">cryptocurrency market is growing very</text>
  <text start="637.49" dur="4.47">very quickly and if it continues to grow</text>
  <text start="640.28" dur="3.66">like this and more people get involved</text>
  <text start="641.96" dur="3.45">with this and more countries look at</text>
  <text start="643.94" dur="3.29">this and the people say you know</text>
  <text start="645.41" dur="4.41">something we want to use this for</text>
  <text start="647.23" dur="4.84">payment we want to use this for</text>
  <text start="649.82" dur="4.02">purchasing we want to use this for</text>
  <text start="652.07" dur="4.26">everything and we never have to transfer</text>
  <text start="653.84" dur="4.98">into the Federal Reserve Note or the</text>
  <text start="656.33" dur="5.37">Euro or anything like that the central</text>
  <text start="658.82" dur="5.34">banks are then finished this is why</text>
  <text start="661.7" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;re very afraid of it right now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="664.16" dur="5.04">almost like the Cabal when the internet</text>
  <text start="667.28" dur="3.42">was first born they looked at it and</text>
  <text start="669.2" dur="3.15">said ad this is gonna be nothing we</text>
  <text start="670.7" dur="3.66">don&amp;#39;t have to worry about it well the</text>
  <text start="672.35" dur="5.76">central bank&amp;#39;s they realize what</text>
  <text start="674.36" dur="5.37">happened with the internet and turned</text>
  <text start="678.11" dur="3.87">out to be something that everyone can</text>
  <text start="679.73" dur="4.86">use and everyone can use it to report on</text>
  <text start="681.98" dur="5.96">different news and people can you know</text>
  <text start="684.59" dur="7.68">tell different stories than what the the</text>
  <text start="687.94" dur="6.22">establishment is reporting the central</text>
