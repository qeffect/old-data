  <text start="584.88" dur="9.209">policies into place because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="588.69" dur="7.889">steering us into the ditch and this is</text>
  <text start="594.089" dur="4.831">exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="596.579" dur="5.25">setting up the economy so they can</text>
  <text start="598.92" dur="8.06">easily just pull the plug and bring it</text>
  <text start="601.829" dur="7.021">down but remember when they do this</text>
  <text start="606.98" dur="5.109">they&amp;#39;re not going to be blaming</text>
  <text start="608.85" dur="6.51">themselves they don&amp;#39;t want people in the</text>
  <text start="612.089" dur="5.881">world blaming them they will make it</text>
  <text start="615.36" dur="6.12">look like another group another country</text>

  <text start="635.91" dur="4.5">they say but don&amp;#39;t worry the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="638.31" dur="4.949">fine that&amp;#39;s why we raise interest rates</text>

  <text start="643.259" dur="8.221">doing fine everything&amp;#39;s perfect now we</text>
  <text start="647.85" dur="7.08">know there&amp;#39;s a huge amount of debt as of</text>
  <text start="651.48" dur="5.82">January 26th did that hit about 18.9</text>
  <text start="654.93" dur="4.5">three trillion dollars now that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="657.3" dur="4.38">debt they&amp;#39;re telling us many put the</text>
  <text start="659.43" dur="7.23">debt estimate at around 200 trillion or</text>
  <text start="661.68" dur="9.779">so but the International Monetary Fund</text>
  <text start="666.66" dur="6.479">back in 2013 posed an idea and said this</text>
  <text start="671.459" dur="3.391">would be really good for the people and</text>
  <text start="673.139" dur="4.471">you know every time they say that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="674.85" dur="7.289">never good for the people all we need to</text>
  <text start="677.61" dur="9.289">do is we need to confiscate citizens</text>
  <text start="682.139" dur="7.89">assets not all their assets just enough</text>
  <text start="686.899" dur="5.74">to bring down the debt a little bit they</text>
  <text start="690.029" dur="4.261">can&amp;#39;t get rid of all the debt they only</text>
  <text start="692.639" dur="5.671">want to be brought down a little bit</text>
  <text start="694.29" dur="6.42">because their business their product is</text>
  <text start="698.31" dur="4.5">debt and if we bring it down a little</text>
  <text start="700.71" dur="4.65">bit we can chug along a little bit</text>
  <text start="702.81" dur="6.3">longer and they can put more countries</text>
  <text start="705.36" dur="7.22">into debt that&amp;#39;s how this works so back</text>
  <text start="709.11" dur="6.27">in 2013 they made this announcement</text>
  <text start="712.58" dur="4.96">saying that listen we can tax everyone</text>
  <text start="715.38" dur="4.1">on their wealth and I think they came</text>
  <text start="717.54" dur="6.83">out with something like ten percent</text>
  <text start="719.48" dur="9.28">today they want to do the same thing</text>
  <text start="724.37" dur="8.02">acid seizures they just want to make the</text>
  <text start="728.76" dur="6.6">debt sustainable and they&amp;#39;re calling on</text>
  <text start="732.39" dur="7.41">everyone to pitch in to help him</text>
  <text start="735.36" dur="9.21">remember the debt is really there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="739.8" dur="7.229">debt was created by them we didn&amp;#39;t ask</text>
  <text start="744.57" dur="4.29">for all this military spending we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="747.029" dur="6.81">ask for all this aid to go to different</text>
  <text start="748.86" dur="9.169">countries we the people we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="753.839" dur="8.221">any of this this is the central bank</text>

  <text start="795.24" dur="6.48">shut down capital controls will be in</text>
  <text start="798.33" dur="9.48">effect no one will be able to get their</text>
  <text start="801.72" dur="9.06">funds they know exactly what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="807.81" dur="7.23">doing with this they&amp;#39;ve been very</text>
  <text start="810.78" dur="7.86">careful in planning they&amp;#39;ve created the</text>
  <text start="815.04" dur="7.56">documents they&amp;#39;ve implemented the</text>
  <text start="818.64" dur="9.55">documents and they will use everything</text>
  <text start="822.6" dur="8.52">that they&amp;#39;ve done when the time is right</text>
  <text start="828.19" dur="5.88">and it&amp;#39;s not the choosing of the people</text>
  <text start="831.12" dur="6.66">it&amp;#39;s the choosing of when they want this</text>
  <text start="834.07" dur="7.14">to be done they are in full control of</text>
  <text start="837.78" dur="5.56">this collapse unless something comes out</text>
  <text start="841.21" dur="5.82">of left field and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="843.34" dur="6.27">working so hard right now to set</text>
  <text start="847.03" dur="5.31">everything up to get ready to bring it</text>
  <text start="849.61" dur="5.12">down right now the bricks are</text>
  <text start="852.34" dur="5.25">celebrating Brazil Russia India China</text>
  <text start="854.73" dur="6.43">because the IMF right now because the</text>
  <text start="857.59" dur="7.32">IMF 2010 quota and the reforms that the</text>
  <text start="861.16" dur="5.07">u.s. promised back in 2010 that they</text>
  <text start="864.91" dur="3.6">were going to give more voting rights to</text>
  <text start="866.23" dur="4.5">the BRIC nations but something very</text>
  <text start="868.51" dur="6.93">interesting about this even though the</text>
  <text start="870.73" dur="7.5">bricks have more voting rights the</text>
  <text start="875.44" dur="4.98">United States still has 16.7 four</text>
  <text start="878.23" dur="6.45">percent and Japan has six point two</text>
  <text start="880.42" dur="6.6">three percent enough still to veto the</text>
  <text start="884.68" dur="5.43">BRIC countries only have fourteen point</text>
  <text start="887.02" dur="6.36">seven percent and they don&amp;#39;t have enough</text>
  <text start="890.11" dur="7.92">to veto anything so the United States is</text>
  <text start="893.38" dur="7.52">still in control of this and the bricks</text>
  <text start="898.03" dur="7.05">get a little bit more of the voting</text>
  <text start="900.9" dur="9.79">percentage but not enough to veto</text>
  <text start="905.08" dur="11.01">anything and we see Saudi Arabia right</text>
  <text start="910.69" dur="8.31">now with OPEC saying there&amp;#39;s no plans to</text>
  <text start="916.09" dur="6.12">meet with Russia there is no plan to cut</text>
  <text start="919" dur="5.46">production right now and it seems like</text>
  <text start="922.21" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re continually pushing trial</text>
  <text start="924.46" dur="5.49">balloons to see how the economy would</text>
  <text start="927.19" dur="4.8">react if they did cut production almost</text>
  <text start="929.95" dur="4.02">like when the Fed was getting ready to</text>
  <text start="931.99" dur="3.81">raise rates they continually put that</text>
  <text start="933.97" dur="3.45">out there put that out there they wanted</text>
  <text start="935.8" dur="3.42">to see how the market reacted get</text>
  <text start="937.42" dur="3.39">everyone used to it and it seems like</text>
  <text start="939.22" dur="4.4">this is what Saudi Arabia is doing right</text>
  <text start="940.81" dur="6.15">now and remember Saudi Arabia is</text>
  <text start="943.62" dur="6.9">continually pushing out oil we have a</text>
  <text start="946.96" dur="7.02">glut of oil on the market and when they</text>
  <text start="950.52" dur="5.11">cut production prices will go up and it</text>
  <text start="953.98" dur="4.68">will allow them to unload their</text>
  <text start="955.63" dur="6.69">Treasuries and it seems like this is</text>
  <text start="958.66" dur="5.94">where they are headed and if we here</text>
  <text start="962.32" dur="6.68">that Saudi Arabia cuts production we are</text>
  <text start="964.6" dur="7.5">that much closer to the collapse and</text>
  <text start="969" dur="5.46">everyone at that point better start</text>
  <text start="972.1" dur="4.74">ramping up what they&amp;#39;re doing in</text>
  <text start="974.46" dur="3.94">preparation listen everyone thanks a lot</text>
