  <text start="78.81" dur="5.01">collapse financial news now today wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="82.05" dur="5.04">a very good day on the market the market</text>
  <text start="83.82" dur="5.549">ended up down today gold moved up once</text>
  <text start="87.09" dur="6.21">again actually it&amp;#39;s approaching fourteen</text>
  <text start="89.369" dur="6.121">hundred dollars an ounce and when we</text>
  <text start="93.3" dur="4.89">look at the economy and we look at</text>
  <text start="95.49" dur="5.87">what&amp;#39;s been going on a lot of the</text>
  <text start="98.19" dur="7.469">Prophet western central bank countries I</text>
  <text start="101.36" dur="7.6">noticed we&amp;#39;re all feeling the same pain</text>
  <text start="105.659" dur="5.761">at once now many people don&amp;#39;t notice</text>
  <text start="108.96" dur="4.589">this many people just going about their</text>
  <text start="111.42" dur="5.4">business they don&amp;#39;t realize what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="113.549" dur="7.381">really going on but when we look at the</text>
  <text start="116.82" dur="6.72">UK there was a new study that found that</text>
  <text start="120.93" dur="5.97">the proportion of people owning their</text>
  <text start="123.54" dur="6.479">homes in England has fallen to its</text>
  <text start="126.9" dur="5.69">lowest level in 30 years sounds very</text>
  <text start="130.019" dur="5.911">familiar to here in the United States</text>
  <text start="132.59" dur="6.28">the resolution foundation study said</text>
  <text start="135.93" dur="5.4">that the soaring prices have forced</text>
  <text start="138.87" dur="5.85">millions to abandon the dream of</text>
  <text start="141.33" dur="7.07">homeownership and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="144.72" dur="7.2">it&amp;#39;s completely unaffordable we cannot</text>
  <text start="148.4" dur="6.339">purchase these homes so English</text>
  <text start="151.92" dur="5.099">homeownership now sits at just sixty</text>
  <text start="154.739" dur="7.381">three point eight percent a level that</text>
  <text start="157.019" dur="7.321">was not seen since 1986 sounds very</text>
  <text start="162.12" dur="4.99">similar to here in the United States</text>
  <text start="164.34" dur="7.27">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all of</text>
  <text start="167.11" dur="5.82">this is that many people still are in</text>
  <text start="171.61" dur="4.59">the dark of what&amp;#39;s really going on here</text>
  <text start="172.93" dur="5.699">because what happens is the United</text>
  <text start="176.2" dur="5.67">States government central bankers their</text>
  <text start="178.629" dur="5.551">entire illusion is based on the stock</text>
  <text start="181.87" dur="5.399">market and when I go around and I talk</text>
  <text start="184.18" dur="4.8">to people and they and I talk about the</text>
  <text start="187.269" dur="3.451">economy they tell me that we&amp;#39;ll wait a</text>
  <text start="188.98" dur="3.509">minute need what do you mean the economy</text>
  <text start="190.72" dur="5.43">is not doing well well the stock market</text>
  <text start="192.489" dur="4.92">is fine look we&amp;#39;re and we&amp;#39;re like 18,000</text>
  <text start="196.15" dur="4.44">pointy it might be down a little bit</text>
  <text start="197.409" dur="6.901">today but look how great it&amp;#39;s doing my</text>
  <text start="200.59" dur="7.13">retirement my Porter it&amp;#39;s fantastic well</text>
  <text start="204.31" dur="9.769">the stock market&amp;#39;s not the economy</text>
  <text start="207.72" dur="9.189">that&amp;#39;s the illusionary manipulated</text>
  <text start="214.079" dur="5.5">device that the u.s. government central</text>
  <text start="216.909" dur="7.08">bankers used to convince you that</text>
  <text start="219.579" dur="7.47">everything is fine but when we look at</text>
  <text start="223.989" dur="7.53">what&amp;#39;s really going on we see the same</text>
  <text start="227.049" dur="8.91">run up to what happened in 1929 in 2001</text>
  <text start="231.519" dur="10.981">2008 and we&amp;#39;re seeing it now it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="235.959" dur="11.101">same exact run-up to the collapse of</text>
  <text start="242.5" dur="6.419">2008 I mean they have a little bit more</text>
  <text start="247.06" dur="5.819">manipulation a little bit more control</text>
  <text start="248.919" dur="7.38">to keep everyone in the dark but reality</text>
  <text start="252.879" dur="5.61">is we&amp;#39;re seeing the same things the same</text>
  <text start="256.299" dur="6.261">things are absolutely happening actually</text>
  <text start="258.489" dur="6.8">the economy is like a ticking time bomb</text>
  <text start="262.56" dur="5.2">everything seems fine as it ticks down</text>
  <text start="265.289" dur="6.301">everyone&amp;#39;s happy running around looks</text>
  <text start="267.76" dur="7.32">great spending money if they have it and</text>
  <text start="271.59" dur="6.639">then when it hits zero the whole thing</text>
  <text start="275.08" dur="5.82">comes to a screeching halt and this is</text>
  <text start="278.229" dur="4.831">what&amp;#39;s happening right now now as we</text>
  <text start="280.9" dur="5.31">know more and more people they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="283.06" dur="4.71">their jobs it&amp;#39;s a fact you can go to</text>
  <text start="286.21" dur="4.59">challenge your gran Christmas you can</text>
  <text start="287.77" dur="7.16">see all the layoffs millions of people</text>
  <text start="290.8" dur="4.13">had been laid off and</text>
  <text start="295.15" dur="8.73">can see this through retail we can see</text>
  <text start="300.34" dur="6.09">this through the part-time America we</text>
  <text start="303.88" dur="7.65">can see this through the people that</text>
  <text start="306.43" dur="8.21">have fallen off the employment market we</text>
  <text start="311.53" dur="5.4">can see this on how people are spending</text>
  <text start="314.64" dur="3.94">now of course the central bankers want</text>
  <text start="316.93" dur="6.24">us to believe that when you spend and</text>
  <text start="318.58" dur="6.3">you use credit use loans that spending</text>
  <text start="323.17" dur="4.5">is increasing well no that&amp;#39;s debt</text>
  <text start="324.88" dur="4.41">increasing that&amp;#39;s not spending spending</text>
  <text start="327.67" dur="3.8">is when you have the actual money and</text>
  <text start="329.29" dur="4.8">you&amp;#39;re actually going out and using it</text>
  <text start="331.47" dur="6.85">using credit cards taking out a loan</text>
  <text start="334.09" dur="8.43">that&amp;#39;s not spending so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="338.32" dur="6.21">right now is savings well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="342.52" dur="4.17">slumping well that makes sense because</text>
  <text start="344.53" dur="4.98">people are not working people might be</text>
  <text start="346.69" dur="6.81">taking whatever they have to pay to live</text>
  <text start="349.51" dur="9.03">and we see an increase in spending on</text>
  <text start="353.5" dur="9.57">credit cards now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="358.54" dur="7.73">about this is that income growth is at</text>
  <text start="363.07" dur="6.78">its lowest since december of 2013 and</text>
  <text start="366.27" dur="10.8">we&amp;#39;re seeing a divergent trend over the</text>
  <text start="369.85" dur="7.22">last six months where credit spending is</text>
  <text start="377.61" dur="11.86">moving up personal income is declining</text>
  <text start="383.79" dur="8.62">this tells us right there and then that</text>
  <text start="389.47" dur="6.18">we have a major problem but of course to</text>
  <text start="392.41" dur="5.22">the central bankers spending is all that</text>
  <text start="395.65" dur="4.14">matters of course doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="397.63" dur="5.73">through credit card through your savings</text>
  <text start="399.79" dur="7.23">it makes no difference as long as you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="403.36" dur="6.72">spending taking out loans using your</text>
  <text start="407.02" dur="6.63">credit cards the economy to them it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="410.08" dur="8.93">fine well it isn&amp;#39;t fine it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="413.65" dur="9.17">worse think about this did a simple test</text>
  <text start="419.01" dur="9.49">how many people do you think can survive</text>
  <text start="422.82" dur="10.27">today without using any credit cards</text>
  <text start="428.5" dur="7.02">using the money that you make or what</text>
  <text start="433.09" dur="5.93">you have in savings do you think people</text>
  <text start="435.52" dur="8.25">can have the lifestyle they have today</text>
  <text start="439.02" dur="7.84">most likely not we see those students</text>
  <text start="443.77" dur="6.9">who have gotten all this student loan</text>
  <text start="446.86" dur="6.09">debt they&amp;#39;re having a major problem they</text>
  <text start="450.67" dur="4.59">can&amp;#39;t find jobs and we know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="452.95" dur="6.69">roughly about 1.3 trillion of student</text>
  <text start="455.26" dur="8.01">loans outstanding and the average</text>
  <text start="459.64" dur="6.84">balance for each student&amp;#39;s about 30,000</text>
  <text start="463.27" dur="5.37">or so roughly sixteen percent of</text>
  <text start="466.48" dur="4.74">borrowers are currently in long-term</text>
  <text start="468.64" dur="3.99">default with outstanding balances</text>
  <text start="471.22" dur="4.46">totaling about a hundred and twenty five</text>
  <text start="472.63" dur="5.76">billion now The Wall Street Journal</text>
  <text start="475.68" dur="7.239">recently ran some stories about</text>
  <text start="478.39" dur="7.52">individuals students and they told their</text>
  <text start="482.919" dur="6.931">story one of their stories was about</text>
  <text start="485.91" dur="6.58">Jason Osborn and his wife a Medford</text>
  <text start="489.85" dur="5.16">Oregon couple who took out about 46,000</text>
  <text start="492.49" dur="6.69">or so in student loans to take classes</text>
  <text start="495.01" dur="5.909">at abdill career college and after</text>
  <text start="499.18" dur="3.51">completing their studies the couple said</text>
  <text start="500.919" dur="4.171">they couldn&amp;#39;t find steady work in the</text>
  <text start="502.69" dur="5.34">health care industry and how to look</text>
  <text start="505.09" dur="4.86">elsewhere right now mr. Osborn makes</text>
  <text start="508.03" dur="4.319">about thirteen dollars an hour selling</text>
  <text start="509.95" dur="6.18">solar panels and his wife works as a</text>
  <text start="512.349" dur="6.031">maid the now the couple is now asking</text>
  <text start="516.13" dur="4.44">why the government would loan them so</text>
  <text start="518.38" dur="6.84">much money to pursue a career with such</text>
  <text start="520.57" dur="7.22">limited opportunity well this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="525.22" dur="5.46">happening across America right now</text>
  <text start="527.79" dur="4.93">students are taking out suit loans</text>
  <text start="530.68" dur="4.65">because they&amp;#39;re hearing there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="532.72" dur="5.82">opportunity there&amp;#39;s jobs don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="535.33" dur="6.96">about it inflate the debt when they get</text>
  <text start="538.54" dur="6.18">out of school there is nothing there so</text>
  <text start="542.29" dur="5.85">the government they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="544.72" dur="5.85">garnish the students if you work</text>
  <text start="548.14" dur="6.84">part-time or anything else and most of</text>
  <text start="550.57" dur="8.1">the times parents step in to backup the</text>
  <text start="554.98" dur="7.4">student loan and those parents their</text>
  <text start="558.67" dur="7.25">salaries are being garnished</text>
  <text start="562.38" dur="6.66">and right now the Education Department</text>
  <text start="565.92" dur="5.04">is turning to a team of behavioral</text>
  <text start="569.04" dur="6.21">scientists who are trying to figure out</text>
  <text start="570.96" dur="6.33">how to get borrowers to respond testing</text>
  <text start="575.25" dur="4.38">things such as what language to use in</text>
  <text start="577.29" dur="5.97">emails what time of day to send text</text>
  <text start="579.63" dur="8.55">messages to get these people to pay back</text>
  <text start="583.26" dur="8.61">their loans well the reason why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="588.18" dur="5.64">not paying back the loans is not because</text>
  <text start="591.87" dur="4.89">the time of day you&amp;#39;re sending the</text>
  <text start="593.82" dur="7.29">emails the text messages that are coming</text>
  <text start="596.76" dur="8.04">in the reason is because they can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="601.11" dur="6.51">jobs they&amp;#39;re working part time or they</text>
  <text start="604.8" dur="5.78">have no job at all and the funds they</text>
  <text start="607.62" dur="7.44">are making guess what it&amp;#39;s not enough</text>
  <text start="610.58" dur="8.59">it&amp;#39;s not enough to have a car to pay for</text>
  <text start="615.06" dur="7.26">the gas to go to work to buy clothes for</text>
  <text start="619.17" dur="5.31">work it just isn&amp;#39;t enough and those</text>
  <text start="622.32" dur="4.59">people who aren&amp;#39;t working at all guess</text>
  <text start="624.48" dur="5.88">what they can&amp;#39;t pay it back no matter</text>
  <text start="626.91" dur="5.85">what but we&amp;#39;re seeing more and more</text>
  <text start="630.36" dur="4.65">indicators that this economy it is</text>
  <text start="632.76" dur="6.93">completely deteriorating very very</text>
  <text start="635.01" dur="6.45">quickly back a couple months ago maybe</text>
  <text start="639.69" dur="5.4">even a year or two years going back</text>
  <text start="641.46" dur="5.34">maybe the 2011 or so construction has</text>
  <text start="645.09" dur="5.93">been one of the few pockets of strength</text>
  <text start="646.8" dur="8.28">in the US economy but until recently</text>
  <text start="651.02" dur="6.49">construction is declining and when we</text>
  <text start="655.08" dur="5.4">look at construction payrolls they have</text>
  <text start="657.51" dur="4.8">declined since March and spending in May</text>
  <text start="660.48" dur="3.9">rose less than three percent from a year</text>
  <text start="662.31" dur="5.4">earlier this is the lowest rate since</text>
  <text start="664.38" dur="4.98">2011 the slowdown can be seen in</text>
  <text start="667.71" dur="3.77">construction payrolls the number of</text>
  <text start="669.36" dur="4.68">people working in the field drop by</text>
  <text start="671.48" dur="6.07">22,000 since hitting a post-recession</text>
  <text start="674.04" dur="6.21">peak in march of about 6.7 million it</text>
  <text start="677.55" dur="4.83">was the first time the job count had</text>
  <text start="680.25" dur="5.82">dropped for two straight months since</text>
  <text start="682.38" dur="6.51">2012 now the trend was reinforced on</text>
  <text start="686.07" dur="4.68">Monday when Vulcan Materials Corp a big</text>

  <text start="705.87" dur="5.04">that the economy is not doing what it</text>
  <text start="709.17" dur="6.95">that everyone thought it was supposed to</text>
  <text start="710.91" dur="9.419">be doing and the amount of shipments is</text>
  <text start="716.12" dur="6.159">declining and we can see this when we</text>
  <text start="720.329" dur="4.19">look at all other economic indicators</text>
  <text start="722.279" dur="6.211">and it&amp;#39;s all starting to catch up now</text>
  <text start="724.519" dur="6.82">the Baltic Dry Index drop by 645 points</text>
  <text start="728.49" dur="6.839">it&amp;#39;s down five points Obamacare is a</text>

  <text start="735.329" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;ve posted a 300 million dollar loss</text>
  <text start="737.85" dur="6.239">and they might be getting out of this</text>
  <text start="740.699" dur="6.24">completely but don&amp;#39;t worry Obamacare has</text>
  <text start="744.089" dur="8.461">a bailout and we can see Obamacare it is</text>
  <text start="746.939" dur="7.77">failing failing failing and it seems</text>
  <text start="752.55" dur="6.209">that this was their plan from the</text>
  <text start="754.709" dur="7.5">beginning because they want a government</text>

  <text start="762.209" dur="6.151">really going for and it seems at this</text>
  <text start="766.589" dur="6.18">point this is what they&amp;#39;re going to try</text>
  <text start="768.36" dur="9.06">to do now very interestingly Obama he</text>
  <text start="772.769" dur="6.271">wants the TPP past and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
