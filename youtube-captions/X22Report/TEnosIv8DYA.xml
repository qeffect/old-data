  <text start="32.529" dur="4.651">today&amp;#39;s date is April 7th 2014 and the</text>
  <text start="35.32" dur="4.22">title of this episode is a dollar is</text>
  <text start="37.18" dur="5.969">dropped as countries and central banks</text>
  <text start="39.54" dur="5.199">declared their holdings in u1 and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="43.149" dur="3.09">going to get into that a little bit</text>
  <text start="44.739" dur="3.061">later in this report but let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="46.239" dur="3.721">started with the economic collapse news</text>
  <text start="47.8" dur="5.79">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="49.96" dur="7.71">90% of all consumer credit in the past</text>
  <text start="53.59" dur="7.35">year was just from student loans and car</text>
  <text start="57.67" dur="7.879">loans not from credit cards people are</text>
  <text start="60.94" dur="9.289">completely tapped out at this time only</text>
  <text start="65.549" dur="8.561">2% was actually from credit card</text>
  <text start="70.229" dur="6.25">purchases what does this tell you this</text>
  <text start="74.11" dur="5.25">tells you the American people are</text>
  <text start="76.479" dur="6">completely tapped out they they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="79.36" dur="4.77">going out and buying things and they</text>
  <text start="82.479" dur="4.351">just don&amp;#39;t have the money they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="84.13" dur="4.77">have the jobs and this is what this is</text>
  <text start="86.83" dur="5.219">telling me right now now Zillow has done</text>
  <text start="88.9" dur="6.63">a study and they&amp;#39;re saying one in three</text>
  <text start="92.049" dur="5.371">homes are unaffordable at this time more</text>
  <text start="95.53" dur="7.409">than half the homes currently on the</text>
  <text start="97.42" dur="8.07">market in seven major American metros</text>
  <text start="102.939" dur="4.68">are currently unaffordable for local</text>
  <text start="105.49" dur="4.89">residents and one third of homes for</text>
  <text start="107.619" dur="6.901">sale are unaffordable by historic</text>
  <text start="110.38" dur="5.849">standards as affordability worsens we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="114.52" dur="4.05">already beginning to see more of the</text>
  <text start="116.229" dur="4.111">kinds of worrisome trends we saw it in</text>
  <text start="118.57" dur="3.9">mastering the years leading up to the</text>
  <text start="120.34" dur="3.809">housing crash these include greater</text>
  <text start="122.47" dur="3.96">reliance on non-traditional home</text>
  <text start="124.149" dur="4.381">financing which we discussed before</text>
  <text start="126.43" dur="5.399">which is adjustable rate mortgages</text>
  <text start="128.53" dur="5.459">giving loans to subprime borrowers and</text>
  <text start="131.829" dur="4.711">we&amp;#39;re seeing people give absolutely no</text>
  <text start="133.989" dur="4.651">down payments or very tiny down payments</text>
  <text start="136.54" dur="4.32">of like $1,000</text>
  <text start="138.64" dur="4.41">and we are seeing this completely happen</text>
  <text start="140.86" dur="5.93">and this is we&amp;#39;re following the same</text>
  <text start="143.05" dur="6.9">exact path that we followed during</text>
  <text start="146.79" dur="5.4">2006-2007 leading up to 2008 and here we</text>
  <text start="149.95" dur="4.38">are right now and what they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="152.19" dur="5.26">more than half of the home&amp;#39;s current</text>
  <text start="154.33" dur="6.21">listed for sale in Miami Los Angeles San</text>
  <text start="157.45" dur="6.48">Diego San Francisco Denver San Jose</text>
  <text start="160.54" dur="6.06">Portland and are all unaffordable by</text>
  <text start="163.93" dur="6.12">historic standards they were all pumped</text>
  <text start="166.6" dur="6.42">up to get people in and what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="170.05" dur="5.52">happen as we know the entire real estate</text>
  <text start="173.02" dur="4.74">market is going to completely implode on</text>
  <text start="175.57" dur="5.1">itself and right now we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="177.76" dur="7.38">mortgage originations plunge to their</text>
  <text start="180.67" dur="6.75">lowest levels on record new mortgage</text>
  <text start="185.14" dur="3.96">origination fell over 23 percent</text>
  <text start="187.42" dur="5.55">month-over-month</text>
  <text start="189.1" dur="7.47">and a stunning 47 percent year-to-date</text>
  <text start="192.97" dur="6.33">according to Black Knight and I mean we</text>
  <text start="196.57" dur="5.82">understand this we understand that the</text>
  <text start="199.3" dur="5.04">mortgage corporations mortgage companies</text>
  <text start="202.39" dur="4.71">have gone either out of business</text>
  <text start="204.34" dur="6.179">where they laid off tens of thousands of</text>
  <text start="207.1" dur="6.24">people why would they do this if we were</text>
  <text start="210.519" dur="5.101">in a housing boom if we&amp;#39;re rebounding if</text>
  <text start="213.34" dur="4.38">we&amp;#39;re seeing the boomerang effect of</text>
  <text start="215.62" dur="4.83">those people who had foreclosures short</text>
  <text start="217.72" dur="4.049">sales lost their jobs have no credit</text>
  <text start="220.45" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re all coming back into the market</text>
  <text start="221.769" dur="5.341">wouldn&amp;#39;t these companies be expanding</text>
  <text start="225.01" dur="4.71">because there are more people who want</text>
  <text start="227.11" dur="6.57">mortgages because we have to realize</text>
  <text start="229.72" dur="6.48">those people who lost their homes due to</text>
  <text start="233.68" dur="4.8">foreclosures or short sales lost their</text>
  <text start="236.2" dur="4.92">jobs have no credit they&amp;#39;re not paying</text>
  <text start="238.48" dur="4.86">in cash so they&amp;#39;re going to go and get a</text>
  <text start="241.12" dur="3.81">mortgage they&amp;#39;re accepting subprime</text>
  <text start="243.34" dur="3.869">borrowers they&amp;#39;re accepting people with</text>
  <text start="244.93" dur="3.93">arms I mean not just arms I mean</text>
  <text start="247.209" dur="4.771">adjustable rate mortgages they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="248.86" dur="6.9">accepting those people who are putting</text>
  <text start="251.98" dur="7.74">very a small down pot deposit on to the</text>
  <text start="255.76" dur="6.03">house so we can see that this has</text>
  <text start="259.72" dur="4.44">nothing to do with the American people</text>
  <text start="261.79" dur="5.34">this housing market was pumped up with</text>
  <text start="264.16" dur="4.62">cash from the Federal Reserve which was</text>
  <text start="267.13" dur="4.02">given to the hedge funds and investment</text>
  <text start="268.78" dur="3.52">companies they pumped up the market they</text>
  <text start="271.15" dur="4">thought they were going to have</text>
  <text start="272.3" dur="4.589">all these Americans rushing to buy these</text>
  <text start="275.15" dur="3.299">homes because the market was being</text>
  <text start="276.889" dur="3.27">pumped up and what are they saying</text>
  <text start="278.449" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re seeing absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="280.159" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re seeing people going I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="282.139" dur="5.791">afford this right now or these people</text>
  <text start="284.419" dur="7.291">are non-existent because everyone has</text>
  <text start="287.93" dur="6.269">credit foreclosures short sales or lost</text>
  <text start="291.71" dur="5.16">job and they&amp;#39;re just not interested in</text>
  <text start="294.199" dur="3.96">putting their money into a house at this</text>
  <text start="296.87" dur="3.299">time where they really just can&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="298.159" dur="5.22">and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="300.169" dur="5.611">and if we really look at this 65 percent</text>
  <text start="303.379" dur="4.741">year-over-year drop new mortgage</text>
  <text start="305.78" dur="5.939">originations are at their lowest since</text>
  <text start="308.12" dur="6.66">their records began the average loan in</text>
  <text start="311.719" dur="6.151">foreclosure is now two point six years</text>
  <text start="314.78" dur="7.08">past two versus point seven years in</text>
  <text start="317.87" dur="6.96">2008 it has just gotten worse and worse</text>
  <text start="321.86" dur="4.95">it is not getting better whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="324.83" dur="3.389">all these people out there telling you</text>
  <text start="326.81" dur="4.02">that real estate is going to rebound</text>
  <text start="328.219" dur="4.32">things are looking great well from every</text>
  <text start="330.83" dur="3.51">single indicator that I&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="332.539" dur="4.53">about all the way up to this point there</text>
  <text start="334.34" dur="4.62">is no way that real estate is all of a</text>
  <text start="337.069" dur="3.84">sudden going to make a comeback because</text>
  <text start="338.96" dur="4.5">we understand I mean let&amp;#39;s just take a</text>
  <text start="340.909" dur="4.861">look at this tens of thousands of people</text>
  <text start="343.46" dur="5.009">being laid off in the mortgage companies</text>
  <text start="345.77" dur="4.889">we have the Fed still pumping in</text>
  <text start="348.469" dur="4.771">billions of billions of dollars to get</text>
  <text start="350.659" dur="5.16">those toxic real estate loans off the</text>
  <text start="353.24" dur="5.19">books of the banks we have so many</text>
  <text start="355.819" dur="4.741">foreclosures we have so many short sales</text>
  <text start="358.43" dur="3.09">and the American people are completely</text>
  <text start="360.56" dur="4.349">tapped out</text>
  <text start="361.52" dur="6.75">they have no credit they can&amp;#39;t find good</text>
  <text start="364.909" dur="5.491">paying jobs and they just don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="368.27" dur="6.6">money at this time and their main worry</text>
  <text start="370.4" dur="6.359">is food rent and just finding a job so</text>
  <text start="374.87" dur="4.74">this housing market that they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="376.759" dur="5.52">about coming back is non-existent and</text>
  <text start="379.61" dur="5.76">we&amp;#39;re reaching the point where it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="382.279" dur="5.85">coming down Zillow is even recognizing</text>
  <text start="385.37" dur="5.31">that there is a major major problem and</text>
  <text start="388.129" dur="4.951">we&amp;#39;re following the same path here and</text>
  <text start="390.68" dur="4.65">of course we all know and we understand</text>
  <text start="393.08" dur="4.26">what is coming and that means the real</text>
  <text start="395.33" dur="3.959">estate market will implode on itself the</text>
  <text start="397.34" dur="3.93">stock market will implode on itself and</text>
  <text start="399.289" dur="4.231">all of a sudden everyone&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="401.27" dur="3.95">looking around going what just happened</text>
  <text start="403.52" dur="4.13">but we understand what</text>
  <text start="405.22" dur="4.62">is happening now before all of this</text>
  <text start="407.65" dur="3.57">happens what the United States the</text>

  <text start="418.42" dur="6.81">every time I see these reports come out</text>
  <text start="421.66" dur="5.22">it convinces me a hundred and ten</text>
  <text start="425.23" dur="3.78">percent that this is what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="426.88" dur="4.11">to do now right now we understand there</text>

  <text start="826.63" dur="2.76">are</text>
  <text start="826.96" dur="4.74">and this is a waste of time the only</text>
  <text start="829.39" dur="5.699">reason they&amp;#39;re pushing this is to remove</text>
  <text start="831.7" dur="6.78">the weapons from the everyday person now</text>
  <text start="835.089" dur="6.031">I saw this report and this is very very</text>
  <text start="838.48" dur="6.42">disturbing and what I&amp;#39;m seeing here is</text>
  <text start="841.12" dur="6.63">that the rights are being taken away by</text>
  <text start="844.9" dur="5.1">the Supreme Court as of course they</text>
  <text start="847.75" dur="3.9">think they are but right now a case</text>

  <text start="851.65" dur="5.52">Court called us first Castleman the case</text>
  <text start="855.279" dur="4.801">was a landmark win for the gun control</text>
  <text start="857.17" dur="5.4">left wing but what no one realized is</text>
  <text start="860.08" dur="5.67">that our Constitution no longer affords</text>
  <text start="862.57" dur="5.67">us rights and what they&amp;#39;re saying is no</text>
  <text start="865.75" dur="5.279">longer rights that are in violet which</text>
  <text start="868.24" dur="4.98">is untouchable the case was decided in</text>
  <text start="871.029" dur="4.711">March 28th the US Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="873.22" dur="5.25">unanimously ruled that the Bill of</text>

  <text start="891.1" dur="6.72">right is forever in violet we the people</text>
  <text start="895.06" dur="6">no longer have that right so what</text>
  <text start="897.82" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re saying they went out and they</text>
  <text start="901.06" dur="5.219">said listen these rights are no longer</text>
  <text start="903.79" dur="4.169">rights they are privileges and the</text>
  <text start="906.279" dur="4.411">government is giving you these</text>
  <text start="907.959" dur="7.051">privileges and we can remove them</text>
  <text start="910.69" dur="6.99">anytime we want and again no this is</text>
  <text start="915.01" dur="4.86">completely wrong we are born with these</text>
  <text start="917.68" dur="3.45">rights the contract We the People with</text>
  <text start="919.87" dur="4.44">all the amendments and all the rights</text>
  <text start="921.13" dur="5.1">that we see in the Constitution is what</text>
  <text start="924.31" dur="4.68">we gave the government to follow this is</text>
  <text start="926.23" dur="4.979">the conduct from us to them if they do</text>
  <text start="928.99" dur="5.43">not follow it they are removed from</text>
  <text start="931.209" dur="5.911">office the Supreme Court doesn&amp;#39;t rule on</text>
  <text start="934.42" dur="5.039">this contract does not rule on the</text>
  <text start="937.12" dur="5.279">Constitution it is for the people</text>
  <text start="939.459" dur="6.06">decide what rights we have in this</text>
  <text start="942.399" dur="5.25">contract so guess what this is</text>
  <text start="945.519" dur="4.98">completely null and void and I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="947.649" dur="6.211">even imagine what Supreme Court justice</text>
  <text start="950.499" dur="7.02">what the NSA the Obama administration or</text>
  <text start="953.86" dur="6.779">any other government type of agency had</text>
  <text start="957.519" dur="5.641">on the Supreme Court justices to rule in</text>
  <text start="960.639" dur="5.94">this way but they always seem to have</text>
  <text start="963.16" dur="5.969">some type of information that they were</text>
  <text start="966.579" dur="5.521">using to spy on these people to make</text>
  <text start="969.129" dur="6.38">them rule in this way and we see a time</text>
  <text start="972.1" dur="6.359">after time and they continually do it</text>
  <text start="975.509" dur="5.92">okay now out in Turkey we understand</text>
  <text start="978.459" dur="5.13">that the president out there daguan they</text>
  <text start="981.429" dur="4.291">had elections they were setting up a</text>
  <text start="983.589" dur="5.1">false flag event in Syria where they</text>
  <text start="985.72" dur="5.19">were trying to sneak military assets and</text>
  <text start="988.689" dur="4.051">military officers across the border and</text>
  <text start="990.91" dur="3.75">once they were in the border they were</text>
  <text start="992.74" dur="4.259">going to fire missiles from Syria into</text>
  <text start="994.66" dur="4.619">Turkey and say oh my god look Suri&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="996.999" dur="4.62">attacking us we have to go in there and</text>
  <text start="999.279" dur="4.711">we need NATO help and we need us help</text>
  <text start="1001.619" dur="4.77">and this is how they would get US and</text>
  <text start="1003.99" dur="4.92">NATO forces into Syria to fight against</text>
  <text start="1006.389" dur="5.31">Assad and remove him and during this</text>
  <text start="1008.91" dur="5.039">time there was a YouTube video that was</text>
  <text start="1011.699" dur="4.14">leaked and put on YouTube but I guess</text>
  <text start="1013.949" dur="4.08">Oregon during the elections didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1015.839" dur="4.98">the people to hear this and he banned</text>
  <text start="1018.029" dur="4.98">YouTube and Twitter but the court ruled</text>
  <text start="1020.819" dur="5.281">that banning Twitter is unconstitutional</text>
  <text start="1023.009" dur="5.67">but they still have YouTube and so no</text>
  <text start="1026.1" dur="5.04">one in Turkey can hear this video at</text>
  <text start="1028.679" dur="5.181">this time and Google right now is trying</text>
  <text start="1031.14" dur="4.38">to fight this to try to get YouTube back</text>
  <text start="1033.86" dur="4.059">in Turkey</text>
  <text start="1035.52" dur="4.559">and we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this goes at</text>
  <text start="1037.919" dur="3.99">this time and again he I&amp;#39;m sure the</text>
  <text start="1040.079" dur="3.781">president Erdogan doesn&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="1041.909" dur="3.691">video to surface and the people to see</text>
  <text start="1043.86" dur="4.74">it because I&amp;#39;m sure they&amp;#39;ll be like hey</text>

  <text start="1048.6" dur="4.559">really hear much from the United States</text>
  <text start="1050.73" dur="5.309">saying you know the people have the</text>
  <text start="1053.159" dur="4.681">right to hear YouTube and see videos and</text>
  <text start="1056.039" dur="3.721">you know it&amp;#39;s part of the democratic</text>
  <text start="1057.84" dur="4.23">policy that they should be allowed to do</text>
  <text start="1059.76" dur="3.96">all of this and have their freedoms to</text>
  <text start="1062.07" dur="3.479">see all this type of information</text>
  <text start="1063.72" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re staying pretty quiet about this</text>
  <text start="1065.549" dur="4.681">why because turkey is already in their</text>
  <text start="1068.37" dur="3.87">back pocket they are a puppet regime</text>
  <text start="1070.23" dur="2.76">they already belong to NATO so they</text>
