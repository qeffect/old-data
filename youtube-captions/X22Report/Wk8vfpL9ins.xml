  <text start="70.31" dur="4.38">economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="72.02" dur="5.76">geopolitical news now we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="74.69" dur="6.27">see a lot of infighting between these</text>
  <text start="77.78" dur="5.28">deep state puppets and we see already</text>
  <text start="80.96" dur="5.159">and we talked about this before about</text>
  <text start="83.06" dur="5.699">commis memo and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="86.119" dur="4.53">Department of Justice is reportedly</text>
  <text start="88.759" dur="3.86">ready to hand over copies of the former</text>
  <text start="90.649" dur="4.681">FBI director james comey x&amp;#39; memos</text>
  <text start="92.619" dur="5.11">detailing his interactions with trump</text>
  <text start="95.33" dur="4.08">now remember the memos were kept very</text>
  <text start="97.729" dur="4.53">private and we need to remember that</text>
  <text start="99.41" dur="5.67">Comey actually passed the memos off to</text>
  <text start="102.259" dur="5.881">Columbia Law professor Daniel Richmond</text>
  <text start="105.08" dur="5.88">and he leaked it to the New York Times</text>
  <text start="108.14" dur="5.91">and they were asked for the memos and</text>
  <text start="110.96" dur="5.549">they wouldn&amp;#39;t hand them over now the</text>
  <text start="114.05" dur="3.59">House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob</text>
  <text start="116.509" dur="3.39">Goodlatte</text>
  <text start="117.64" dur="3.7">he was expected to subpoena the</text>
  <text start="119.899" dur="3.72">Department of Justice earlier this week</text>
  <text start="121.34" dur="6.33">in order to obtain the copies of the</text>
  <text start="123.619" dur="6.571">seven memos but we&amp;#39;re seeing that they</text>
  <text start="127.67" dur="4.47">might be handing these over on their own</text>
  <text start="130.19" dur="5.04">but Deputy Attorney General rod</text>
  <text start="132.14" dur="4.98">Rosenstein began to stall on the</text>
  <text start="135.23" dur="4.11">requested document delivery telling</text>
  <text start="137.12" dur="4.02">lawmakers on Monday that commis memos</text>
  <text start="139.34" dur="4.02">may be related to an ongoing</text>
  <text start="141.14" dur="4.37">investigation and that they may report</text>
  <text start="143.36" dur="4.44">confidential presidential communications</text>
  <text start="145.51" dur="4.66">meaning that congressional investigators</text>
  <text start="147.8" dur="5.37">have a legal duty to evaluate the</text>
  <text start="150.17" dur="7.26">consequences of providing access to them</text>
  <text start="153.17" dur="8.819">and what he&amp;#39;s doing is he&amp;#39;s not protest</text>
  <text start="157.43" dur="7.74">protecting Trump he&amp;#39;s protecting what is</text>
  <text start="161.989" dur="8.131">in those memos which shows Comey</text>
  <text start="165.17" dur="7.02">lied and it basically opens up the case</text>
  <text start="170.12" dur="3.36">and this is what they&amp;#39;ve been most</text>
  <text start="172.19" dur="4.17">worried about this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="173.48" dur="5.1">protecting the memos and not allowing</text>
  <text start="176.36" dur="4.59">these to see the day of light now</text>
  <text start="178.58" dur="4.35">there&amp;#39;s a massive battle brewing between</text>
  <text start="180.95" dur="4.709">Comey and Andy</text>
  <text start="182.93" dur="3.54">McCabe and we can see they&amp;#39;re going back</text>
  <text start="185.659" dur="3.871">and forth</text>
  <text start="186.47" dur="6.93">and they&amp;#39;re basically calling each other</text>
  <text start="189.53" dur="5.91">liars and it&amp;#39;s just unbelievable how</text>
  <text start="193.4" dur="4.14">everyone is taking their own side</text>
  <text start="195.44" dur="4.23">protecting themselves and going after</text>
  <text start="197.54" dur="4.83">each other now this is gonna get a lot</text>
  <text start="199.67" dur="4.59">worse as time goes on because as these</text>
  <text start="202.37" dur="4.11">cases move forward and these criminal</text>
  <text start="204.26" dur="4.95">investigations are brought to the</text>
  <text start="206.48" dur="5.22">forefront these individuals are going to</text>
  <text start="209.21" dur="4.8">be put into the spotlight of what they</text>
  <text start="211.7" dur="4.68">have been doing and what crimes they</text>
  <text start="214.01" dur="5.76">have committed and these individuals</text>
  <text start="216.38" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re either gonna run or commit</text>
  <text start="219.77" dur="3.21">suicide</text>
  <text start="220.31" dur="3.54">or they&amp;#39;re gonna point fingers all over</text>
  <text start="222.98" dur="2.73">the place and I think in the beginning</text>
  <text start="223.85" dur="3.6">stages they&amp;#39;re gonna start pointing</text>
  <text start="225.71" dur="4.77">fingers which we can see right now and</text>
  <text start="227.45" dur="5.25">when it gets too hot I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="230.48" dur="4.83">gonna make their next move and we can</text>
  <text start="232.7" dur="5.34">see right now everyone is getting really</text>
  <text start="235.31" dur="4.8">worried and again here we are April</text>
  <text start="238.04" dur="4.35">showers could be many things the bombing</text>
  <text start="240.11" dur="4.32">of Syria April showers could be the</text>
  <text start="242.39" dur="4.35">investigation into all these different</text>
  <text start="244.43" dur="5.029">individuals it&amp;#39;s going to bring May</text>
  <text start="246.74" dur="5.45">flowers so we need to remember this now</text>
  <text start="249.459" dur="4.931">the National Guard update where Trump</text>
  <text start="252.19" dur="4.12">basically sent the National Guard to all</text>
  <text start="254.39" dur="3.81">the border states except for California</text>
  <text start="256.31" dur="4.85">because California will not allow them</text>
  <text start="258.2" dur="5.88">in now all of a sudden it looks like</text>
  <text start="261.16" dur="5.14">Governor Jerry Brown says California has</text>
  <text start="264.08" dur="6.21">reached an agreement with Trump on the</text>
  <text start="266.3" dur="6.39">National Guard border mission and Q has</text>
  <text start="270.29" dur="6.65">said that he had no choice</text>
  <text start="272.69" dur="7.2">so remember his post he said q 1072</text>
  <text start="276.94" dur="5.2">border states are very key bigger than</text>
  <text start="279.89" dur="5.1">you can imagine California is special</text>
  <text start="282.14" dur="4.44">the public will learn and we can see</text>
  <text start="284.99" dur="3.24">already we&amp;#39;re starting to learn and</text>
  <text start="286.58" dur="5.37">we&amp;#39;re gonna learn a lot more as</text>
  <text start="288.23" dur="7.22">information comes out now nikki Haley</text>
  <text start="291.95" dur="7.32">was kept in the dark about Russia</text>
  <text start="295.45" dur="5.32">completely because she came out right</text>
  <text start="299.27" dur="2.94">after the Syrian strike saying that</text>
  <text start="300.77" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re going to place sanctions on</text>
  <text start="302.21" dur="4.53">Russia now she thought this is what we</text>
  <text start="304.1" dur="9.24">always do we bomb we place and we go</text>
  <text start="306.74" dur="9.84">after Russia but Trump and Putin through</text>
  <text start="313.34" dur="5.939">backchannels they were talking privately</text>
  <text start="316.58" dur="6.479">and nikki Haley</text>
  <text start="319.279" dur="6.81">didn&amp;#39;t realize this now let&amp;#39;s read what</text>
  <text start="323.059" dur="5.13">the newspaper is reporting because the</text>
  <text start="326.089" dur="4.83">the corporate media is out there saying</text>
  <text start="328.189" dur="4.74">that you know Trump went behind Nikki</text>
  <text start="330.919" dur="3.45">Haley&amp;#39;s back and they&amp;#39;re making all this</text>
  <text start="332.929" dur="3.51">stuff up now</text>
  <text start="334.369" dur="4.98">they wrote Russians Russia&amp;#39;s leaders</text>
  <text start="336.439" dur="4.44">wanted to give President Trump another</text>
  <text start="339.349" dur="3.45">chance to make good on pledges to</text>
  <text start="340.879" dur="3.6">improve ties and avoid escalation</text>
  <text start="342.799" dur="4.89">according to four people familiar with</text>
  <text start="344.479" dur="6.24">the matter one said the Kremlin has</text>
  <text start="347.689" dur="5.88">ordered officials to curb their anti-us</text>
  <text start="350.719" dur="6.33">rhetoric Putin&amp;#39;s decision explains why</text>
  <text start="353.569" dur="6.03">lawmakers Monday suddenly pulled a draft</text>
  <text start="357.049" dur="5.55">law that would have imposed sweeping</text>
  <text start="359.599" dur="6.39">counter sanctions on US companies two of</text>
  <text start="362.599" dur="6.59">the people said now when we look at this</text>
  <text start="365.989" dur="7.59">we need to look at the second paragraph</text>
  <text start="369.189" dur="7.3">lawmakers Monday suddenly pulled Monday</text>
  <text start="373.579" dur="6.24">during the day it says which would be</text>
  <text start="376.489" dur="5.88">Sunday night in Washington DC so the BAA</text>
  <text start="379.819" dur="6.45">by the looks of it America and Russia</text>
  <text start="382.369" dur="7.8">engaged in a conversation and Haley was</text>
  <text start="386.269" dur="6.03">not informed until after the fact she</text>
  <text start="390.169" dur="6.45">had no clue that there were talks</text>
  <text start="392.299" dur="7.2">happening behind the scenes so her deep</text>
  <text start="396.619" dur="5.28">state mind went right to sanctions and</text>
  <text start="399.499" dur="4.32">she started spouting out sanctions all</text>
  <text start="401.899" dur="3.42">over the place and this is why Trump</text>
  <text start="403.819" dur="4.62">said no there&amp;#39;s not going to be any</text>
  <text start="405.319" dur="4.92">sanctions because the deal was behind</text>
  <text start="408.439" dur="4.29">the scenes there was going to be no</text>
  <text start="410.239" dur="5.16">sanctions now the new the US nuclear</text>
  <text start="412.729" dur="6.6">submarine that helped the US UK and</text>
  <text start="415.399" dur="6">French bomb Syria last week is no longer</text>
  <text start="419.329" dur="5.07">welcome near the waters of Italy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="421.399" dur="7.08">largest seaports and this is coming from</text>
  <text start="424.399" dur="7.38">Naples mayor and he wrote last week that</text>
  <text start="428.479" dur="5.04">they don&amp;#39;t want the submarine there so</text>
  <text start="431.779" dur="5.28">we can sir already that certain</text>
  <text start="433.519" dur="6.45">countries are now taking sides the EU</text>
  <text start="437.059" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re not together the European</text>
  <text start="439.969" dur="4.59">nations are not together with the United</text>
  <text start="441.979" dur="5.76">States anymore now this is one of the</text>
  <text start="444.559" dur="6.21">things that happened during this Syria</text>
  <text start="447.739" dur="5.251">bombing where the European nations they</text>
  <text start="450.769" dur="3.301">are divided</text>
  <text start="452.99" dur="4.83">now something else very interesting</text>
  <text start="454.07" dur="5.31">happen the Syrian military found two</text>
  <text start="457.82" dur="4.02">cruise missiles that did not explode</text>
  <text start="459.38" dur="3.69">during the us-led missile strike both</text>
  <text start="461.84" dur="3.48">missiles were discovered to be</text>
  <text start="463.07" dur="4.98">relatively in good shape and they were</text>
  <text start="465.32" dur="5.7">handed over to Russia now</text>
  <text start="468.05" dur="6.69">the known missile types used included</text>
  <text start="471.02" dur="6.3">the tomahawk now out of the hundred</text>
  <text start="474.74" dur="5.01">something missiles that were fired we</text>
  <text start="477.32" dur="5.34">know that Russia intercepted 70 or so</text>
  <text start="479.75" dur="4.62">missiles which leaves 32 missiles that</text>
  <text start="482.66" dur="5.07">you know hit their targets</text>
  <text start="484.37" dur="6.33">now did all the missiles now since these</text>
  <text start="487.73" dur="4.59">two and this is this is kind of odd</text>
  <text start="490.7" dur="3.48">because there&amp;#39;s two missiles that didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="492.32" dur="3.3">explode out of all these men and we</text>
  <text start="494.18" dur="3.75">spent millions and millions of dollars I</text>
  <text start="495.62" dur="4.59">have probably billions on these missiles</text>
  <text start="497.93" dur="7.17">and for them not to work that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="500.21" dur="8.85">strange so what if some of the missiles</text>
  <text start="505.1" dur="6.3">weren&amp;#39;t even armed think about this for</text>
  <text start="509.06" dur="5.22">a second don&amp;#39;t you think think it&amp;#39;s odd</text>
  <text start="511.4" dur="5.16">that these billion dollar missile</text>
  <text start="514.28" dur="6.39">systems that two of them I could</text>
  <text start="516.56" dur="7.38">understand one maybe but two didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="520.67" dur="5.7">explode seems like something&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="523.94" dur="5.49">here we see already that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="526.37" dur="5.73">nuclear carrier Truman Strike Group has</text>
  <text start="529.43" dur="5.07">finally entered the Mediterranean six</text>
  <text start="532.1" dur="3.78">days after the strike now once again</text>
  <text start="534.5" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re bringing these ships in and I</text>
  <text start="535.88" dur="5.88">believe the next phase of all this is to</text>
  <text start="538.85" dur="6.51">bring the troops out of Syria and to get</text>
  <text start="541.76" dur="6.45">the deep state operatives in Iran are we</text>
  <text start="545.36" dur="5.49">going to war with Iran no that would be</text>
  <text start="548.21" dur="4.38">ridiculous because if we were going to</text>
  <text start="550.85" dur="5.19">go to war we would have gone to war</text>
  <text start="552.59" dur="6.6">already in North Korea in Syria with</text>
  <text start="556.04" dur="7.35">Russia but you can see by the actions of</text>
  <text start="559.19" dur="5.81">Trump he&amp;#39;s not looking for a war the</text>
  <text start="563.39" dur="4.77">mission that he&amp;#39;s talking about is</text>
  <text start="565" dur="6.01">removing the deep state is removing the</text>
  <text start="568.16" dur="5.31">Islamic state that is the mission it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="571.01" dur="6.45">to corner the deep state and make them</text>
  <text start="573.47" dur="6.75">squirm expose where the terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="577.46" dur="5.61">are where they&amp;#39;re going to push their</text>
  <text start="580.22" dur="6.24">offensive they&amp;#39;re trying to find all of</text>
  <text start="583.07" dur="7.079">this out and expose all this information</text>
  <text start="586.46" dur="6.15">now another interesting thing is there</text>
  <text start="590.149" dur="6.271">are about a hundred and fifty Islamic</text>
  <text start="592.61" dur="5.31">state victims uncovered in Raqqa and we</text>
  <text start="596.42" dur="3.87">need to remember that the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="597.92" dur="4.32">al Qaeda al nusra al sham moderate</text>
  <text start="600.29" dur="4.35">rebels Syrian democratic forces they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="602.24" dur="5.28">all one in the same they they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="604.64" dur="6.24">all intertwined they go back and forth</text>
  <text start="607.52" dur="6.3">to different groups and this shows you</text>
  <text start="610.88" dur="5.399">that these people have been tortured</text>
  <text start="613.82" dur="5.49">these people have been thrown into mass</text>
  <text start="616.279" dur="6.331">graves and for anyone to say oh it was</text>
  <text start="619.31" dur="6.27">Assad that is torturing people well</text>
  <text start="622.61" dur="5.37">let&amp;#39;s look at this this is the terrorist</text>
  <text start="625.58" dur="5.28">group and if you listen to the reports</text>
  <text start="627.98" dur="4.89">from the people once these towns and</text>
  <text start="630.86" dur="4.77">cities are liberated from the terrorist</text>
  <text start="632.87" dur="4.98">groups that people tell their stories of</text>
  <text start="635.63" dur="4.68">how hard it was how horrible it was</text>
  <text start="637.85" dur="4.95">living with terrorist groups they were</text>
  <text start="640.31" dur="5.82">scared every day of being tortured or</text>
  <text start="642.8" dur="5.43">killed so this is where the UN should be</text>
  <text start="646.13" dur="4.44">looking this is where the United States</text>
  <text start="648.23" dur="4.01">should be looking now even though the</text>
  <text start="650.57" dur="5.25">deep state you know</text>
  <text start="652.24" dur="5.68">controls pays for supports all these</text>
  <text start="655.82" dur="5.7">terrorist groups because they are there</text>
  <text start="657.92" dur="6.539">they&amp;#39;re paid mercenary army now very</text>
  <text start="661.52" dur="4.56">interestingly and maybe this is a</text>
  <text start="664.459" dur="5.521">coincidence and I don&amp;#39;t believe in</text>
  <text start="666.08" dur="7.02">coincidences chlorine containers from</text>
  <text start="669.98" dur="7.53">Germany and smoke bombs from Salsbury</text>
  <text start="673.1" dur="7.98">are found in Syria now let&amp;#39;s connect</text>
  <text start="677.51" dur="5.25">some of these dots Salsbury the scruple</text>
  <text start="681.08" dur="5.46">poisoning and Syria chemical weapons</text>

  <text start="730.46" dur="7.25">resulted in the launch of these missiles</text>
  <text start="733.34" dur="9.08">on all of these targets and we know that</text>
  <text start="737.71" dur="9.28">Syria and Russia found a chemical</text>

  <text start="749.36" dur="6.03">systems which ran all under these cities</text>
  <text start="752.78" dur="5.34">and connecting the towns so they can</text>
  <text start="755.39" dur="6.81">move chemical weapons back and forth so</text>
  <text start="758.12" dur="6.84">the entire story is completely falling</text>
  <text start="762.2" dur="5.85">apart and more and more evidence is</text>
  <text start="764.96" dur="7.11">coming out showing that these countries</text>
  <text start="768.05" dur="6.75">are supplying the terrorist group with</text>
  <text start="772.07" dur="5.76">the weapons the chemicals they need to</text>
  <text start="774.8" dur="6.48">push their agenda you think this is why</text>
  <text start="777.83" dur="5.97">we&amp;#39;re seeing chlorine gas attacks most</text>
  <text start="781.28" dur="4.26">likely and it&amp;#39;s funny how nobody brings</text>
  <text start="783.8" dur="3.54">it up nikki Haley doesn&amp;#39;t bring it up</text>
  <text start="785.54" dur="4.29">the corporate media doesn&amp;#39;t bring it up</text>
  <text start="787.34" dur="4.86">that may be that terrorists and they are</text>
  <text start="789.83" dur="5.9">called terrorists for a reason maybe</text>
  <text start="792.2" dur="7.32">they&amp;#39;re the ones who are torturing</text>
  <text start="795.73" dur="6.22">gassing the people of Syria even the</text>
  <text start="799.52" dur="5.88">people of Syria are saying it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="801.95" dur="6.26">terrorists it&amp;#39;s not Assad so we can see</text>
  <text start="805.4" dur="7.62">right now their entire narrative is</text>
  <text start="808.21" dur="8.23">falling apart now we can see that</text>
  <text start="813.02" dur="7.11">McMasters andcue posted something about</text>
  <text start="816.44" dur="8.64">McMasters where his father died under</text>
  <text start="820.13" dur="7.68">suspicious circumstances and McMasters</text>
  <text start="825.08" dur="6.92">is part of the deep state and Q is</text>
  <text start="827.81" dur="7.59">saying that McMasters lost the ear of</text>
  <text start="832" dur="5.92">Trump now remember they were deep state</text>
  <text start="835.4" dur="5.25">operatives in the White House to direct</text>
  <text start="837.92" dur="5.91">Trump to do certain things they were</text>
  <text start="840.65" dur="5.31">there to control him McMasters was one</text>
  <text start="843.83" dur="4.98">of them and you can see during the North</text>
  <text start="845.96" dur="5.85">Korea crisis big masters was continually</text>
  <text start="848.81" dur="4.86">talking about invasion having a plan</text>
  <text start="851.81" dur="2.43">this is how many troops are going to be</text>
  <text start="853.67" dur="2.519">lost</text>
  <text start="854.24" dur="4.17">we&amp;#39;re getting ready any day we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="856.189" dur="3.541">in there because he was trying to</text>
  <text start="858.41" dur="3.479">convince Trump and he thought he had</text>
  <text start="859.73" dur="6.479">Trump convinced and the opposite was</text>
  <text start="861.889" dur="8.101">happening and now his father passed away</text>
  <text start="866.209" dur="5.341">and it&amp;#39;s from blunt impact trauma to the</text>
  <text start="869.99" dur="4.379">head now some people are saying that he</text>
  <text start="871.55" dur="5.459">fell hit his head others are saying that</text>
  <text start="874.369" dur="6.871">this was a hit because McMasters didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="877.009" dur="6.81">do his job if you fail at your job in</text>
  <text start="881.24" dur="5.519">the deep state well guess what</text>
  <text start="883.819" dur="4.921">bad things happen now why didn&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="886.759" dur="4.17">hit McMasters why didn&amp;#39;t they remove him</text>
  <text start="888.74" dur="3.569">well that would have been a big story</text>
  <text start="890.929" dur="3.301">and I think they were setting a message</text>
  <text start="892.309" dur="5.94">to him because they might need him later</text>
  <text start="894.23" dur="7.32">on for something else now I want to go</text>
  <text start="898.249" dur="6.601">back to Q&amp;#39;s post about the threat is</text>
  <text start="901.55" dur="5.329">real war is real good verse evil is real</text>
  <text start="904.85" dur="6.589">think State of the Union</text>
  <text start="906.879" dur="7.541">fre coincidence Delta engine fire</text>
  <text start="911.439" dur="6.37">coincidence how rare are engine fires</text>
  <text start="914.42" dur="7.949">think logically and he was also talking</text>
  <text start="917.809" dur="6.51">about the Texas bombs new booms and that</text>
  <text start="922.369" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re going to try to pin all of this</text>
  <text start="924.319" dur="4.971">on cue now all of these things that are</text>
  <text start="926.809" dur="5.37">happening right now are messages and</text>
  <text start="929.29" dur="5.62">this is the shadow war that&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="932.179" dur="5.491">behind the scenes and they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="934.91" dur="5.19">ready to do something an event that is</text>
  <text start="937.67" dur="5.129">very very big where they&amp;#39;re going to try</text>
  <text start="940.1" dur="4.38">to link this to Q and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="942.799" dur="4.26">that this is going to happen in Texas</text>
  <text start="944.48" dur="5.519">now there is dynamite that is missing</text>
  <text start="947.059" dur="6.45">from Pennsylvania people are theorizing</text>
  <text start="949.999" dur="6.51">that maybe these sticks of dynamite are</text>
  <text start="953.509" dur="5.341">going to be used for this we don&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="956.509" dur="4.471">don&amp;#39;t have confirmation of this but it</text>
  <text start="958.85" dur="2.849">is a possibility or they might be doing</text>
  <text start="960.98" dur="2.579">something else</text>
  <text start="961.699" dur="4.651">that&amp;#39;s completely different but we know</text>
  <text start="963.559" dur="5.25">that there is a false flag headed our</text>
  <text start="966.35" dur="5.489">way and they&amp;#39;re going to make it look</text>
  <text start="968.809" dur="5.37">like this was because of Q he</text>
  <text start="971.839" dur="4.29">orchestrated it and everyone that is</text>
  <text start="974.179" dur="3.27">following Q is responsible for because</text>
  <text start="976.129" dur="4.02">what are they trying to do they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="977.449" dur="5.041">trying to shut down this communication</text>
  <text start="980.149" dur="5.821">they&amp;#39;re trying to stop the truth from</text>
  <text start="982.49" dur="5.83">coming out the truth is their biggest</text>
  <text start="985.97" dur="5.59">enemy because</text>
  <text start="988.32" dur="6.15">truth has the facts you can lie all you</text>
  <text start="991.56" dur="5.97">want but the truth will stand proud you</text>
  <text start="994.47" dur="5.73">can&amp;#39;t do anything with the truth that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="997.53" dur="4.29">the biggest problem because all you have</text>
  <text start="1000.2" dur="2.64">to do is show a couple of facts and say</text>
  <text start="1001.82" dur="4.44">this is true</text>
  <text start="1002.84" dur="6.21">propaganda melts away around it and they</text>
  <text start="1006.26" dur="4.74">know this and the only way they can stop</text>
  <text start="1009.05" dur="4.35">people from telling the truth</text>
  <text start="1011" dur="4.23">is to censor them to shut them down this</text>
  <text start="1013.4" dur="3.92">is why they&amp;#39;ve been censoring and</text>
  <text start="1015.23" dur="4.8">shutting down people&amp;#39;s channels</text>
  <text start="1017.32" dur="4.87">censoring them on Facebook censoring</text>
  <text start="1020.03" dur="4.86">them on Twitter because this is the only</text>
  <text start="1022.19" dur="7.38">way they know how to shut people up</text>
  <text start="1024.89" dur="7.439">basically because how else do they prove</text>
  <text start="1029.57" dur="6.24">their propaganda if other people are</text>
  <text start="1032.329" dur="5.191">telling the truth and once there&amp;#39;s facts</text>
  <text start="1035.81" dur="5.519">behind of it that can back all of this</text>
  <text start="1037.52" dur="5.819">up the propaganda well it just</text>
  <text start="1041.329" dur="5.611">disappears and people start to realize</text>
  <text start="1043.339" dur="6.871">wow this is all propaganda we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1046.94" dur="6.93">lied to so we can expect something</text>
  <text start="1050.21" dur="5.16">pretty darn huge headed our way and most</text>
  <text start="1053.87" dur="4.5">likely it&amp;#39;s going to happen in the</text>
