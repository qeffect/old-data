  <text start="99.36" dur="4.44">news now the people of the United States</text>
  <text start="101.94" dur="4.44">and around the world and this happened</text>
  <text start="103.8" dur="5.01">at different times we&amp;#39;ve been under the</text>
  <text start="106.38" dur="4.44">power of the central bank they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="108.81" dur="4.8">controlling the country they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="110.82" dur="4.95">dictating how our financial system</text>
  <text start="113.61" dur="5.1">should work and how it should look and</text>
  <text start="115.77" dur="5.129">what we should believe and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="118.71" dur="6.659">doing this for quite a while now during</text>
  <text start="120.899" dur="9.691">this period their economic system always</text>
  <text start="125.369" dur="9.381">breaks down this is the way their system</text>
  <text start="130.59" dur="6.66">works it&amp;#39;s designed not to last past</text>
  <text start="134.75" dur="5.29">3540 years and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="137.25" dur="4.319">crashes yes they can manipulate it to</text>
  <text start="140.04" dur="3.39">keep it going a little bit longer but</text>
  <text start="141.569" dur="4.711">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is the</text>
  <text start="143.43" dur="3.84">economic system it just will not operate</text>
  <text start="146.28" dur="3">anymore</text>
  <text start="147.27" dur="3.63">you of course they can manipulate the</text>
  <text start="149.28" dur="3.06">statistics that can make the stock</text>
  <text start="150.9" dur="4.32">market look great all the numbers look</text>
  <text start="152.34" dur="5.46">great but if the underlying economic</text>
  <text start="155.22" dur="5.07">system is not working those numbers are</text>
  <text start="157.8" dur="5.67">meaningless if people are out of jobs</text>
  <text start="160.29" dur="5.07">and people can&amp;#39;t purchase things it</text>
  <text start="163.47" dur="4.44">doesn&amp;#39;t matter if the stock market goes</text>
  <text start="165.36" dur="4.5">up to a hundred thousand because people</text>
  <text start="167.91" dur="4.35">will realize at that point there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="169.86" dur="4.89">something wrong that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="172.26" dur="4.68">approaching right now and we know from</text>
  <text start="174.75" dur="4.44">the past that they&amp;#39;d like to have some</text>
  <text start="176.94" dur="4.38">type of an event like a war to cover up</text>
  <text start="179.19" dur="3.96">everything to explain away why you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="181.32" dur="3.87">get certain products why the economic</text>
  <text start="183.15" dur="3.919">system is breaking down why the</text>
  <text start="185.19" dur="4.1">government&amp;#39;s have to print</text>
  <text start="187.069" dur="4.471">money or just push a button and have the</text>
  <text start="189.29" dur="5.399">electronic money you know just come into</text>
  <text start="191.54" dur="5.97">the system and now they don&amp;#39;t have that</text>
  <text start="194.689" dur="5.42">and this is a huge huge problem for them</text>
  <text start="197.51" dur="5.369">so what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="200.109" dur="5.41">what Trump is doing at this point and</text>
  <text start="202.879" dur="5.821">what is that trade wars tariff and of</text>
  <text start="205.519" dur="5.7">course what Trump is doing he&amp;#39;s building</text>
  <text start="208.7" dur="4.86">the economy up making it look like it is</text>
  <text start="211.219" dur="4.711">absolutely fantastic so they can&amp;#39;t turn</text>
  <text start="213.56" dur="4.62">around and say yeah your tariffs broke</text>
  <text start="215.93" dur="4.619">the system but that&amp;#39;s not gonna stop</text>
  <text start="218.18" dur="4.649">them you have to understand their goal</text>
  <text start="220.549" dur="4.351">is to get around this they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="222.829" dur="4.351">be blamed for this especially the Bank</text>
  <text start="224.9" dur="5.16">of International Settlement the IMF I</text>
  <text start="227.18" dur="6.6">believe the Fed right now is working</text>
  <text start="230.06" dur="5.73">with Trump not the entire Fed yes we</text>
  <text start="233.78" dur="4.889">still have deep state swamp creatures</text>
  <text start="235.79" dur="5.309">within every organization but the</text>
  <text start="238.669" dur="5.13">control of the organization I believe is</text>
  <text start="241.099" dur="4.47">now on the same page as Trump and this</text>
  <text start="243.799" dur="4.31">is why we&amp;#39;re continually seeing them</text>
  <text start="245.569" dur="5.34">raising the rates Trump is out there</text>
  <text start="248.109" dur="5.77">criticizing the Fed for raising the</text>
  <text start="250.909" dur="7.26">rates and this is what he&amp;#39;s done in the</text>
  <text start="253.879" dur="6.6">past and this is a game or a strategy</text>
  <text start="258.169" dur="4.381">that he uses to convince the mainstream</text>
  <text start="260.479" dur="4.021">media and the rest that yeah I never</text>
  <text start="262.55" dur="5.73">really wanted this but in reality this</text>
  <text start="264.5" dur="5.31">is exactly what they wanted so right now</text>
  <text start="268.28" dur="3.99">US retails and we talked about this</text>
  <text start="269.81" dur="4.47">before they&amp;#39;re saying that this holiday</text>
  <text start="272.27" dur="4.17">season because of the tariffs that</text>
  <text start="274.28" dur="5.129">prices on certain products are going to</text>
  <text start="276.44" dur="5.37">go up and after the holiday season it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="279.409" dur="4.44">going to get worse so what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="281.81" dur="4.68">right now is they&amp;#39;re projecting that</text>
  <text start="283.849" dur="3.54">this holiday season is not going to be</text>
  <text start="286.49" dur="3.179">that great</text>
  <text start="287.389" dur="3.511">now we&amp;#39;ve seen in the past that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="289.669" dur="3.661">been following the economy for a very</text>
  <text start="290.9" dur="5.4">long time every holiday season has</text>
  <text start="293.33" dur="6.059">gotten worse and worse and worse now</text>
  <text start="296.3" dur="5.82">they have the tariffs to blame for this</text>
  <text start="299.389" dur="4.65">disastrous holiday season and it looks</text>
  <text start="302.12" dur="5.97">like that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="304.039" dur="6.511">actually we have the target CEO Walmart</text>
  <text start="308.09" dur="4.199">out there and the rest saying you know</text>
  <text start="310.55" dur="4.89">this is going to be a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="312.289" dur="6.211">disaster and they&amp;#39;re warning everyone</text>
  <text start="315.44" dur="4.71">that it&amp;#39;s because of the tariffs now we</text>
  <text start="318.5" dur="3.75">have to understand</text>
  <text start="320.15" dur="4.86">how we got to this point remember it the</text>
  <text start="322.25" dur="6.14">central bank system declines over time</text>
  <text start="325.01" dur="5.58">the reason why they had to move all</text>
  <text start="328.39" dur="5.17">manufacturing and the production of</text>
  <text start="330.59" dur="6.02">goods out of this country and import</text>
  <text start="333.56" dur="6.33">them back into the country is because as</text>
  <text start="336.61" dur="6.1">the dollar loses value it takes more</text>
  <text start="339.89" dur="4.68">dollars to buy the same product if they</text>
  <text start="342.71" dur="4.08">kept the manufacturing within this</text>
  <text start="344.57" dur="4.47">country these products would be out of</text>
  <text start="346.79" dur="6.33">reach for every single person in this</text>
  <text start="349.04" dur="6.12">country so what did they have to do they</text>
  <text start="353.12" dur="2.58">had to move manufacturing out of this</text>
  <text start="355.16" dur="4.53">country</text>
  <text start="355.7" dur="7.05">to very very cheap labor areas and that</text>
  <text start="359.69" dur="6.32">would be China emerging markets and they</text>
  <text start="362.75" dur="8.73">did this on purpose because their system</text>
  <text start="366.01" dur="8.32">does not last forever it comes to an end</text>
  <text start="371.48" dur="6.06">and during this period of time the</text>
  <text start="374.33" dur="5.04">system breaks down and if people noticed</text>
  <text start="377.54" dur="4.89">the system breaking down and people</text>
  <text start="379.37" dur="5.19">couldn&amp;#39;t afford these products everyone</text>
  <text start="382.43" dur="4.23">would notice that it was the Fed it was</text>
  <text start="384.56" dur="4.17">their system why is this happening and</text>
  <text start="386.66" dur="4.17">they can&amp;#39;t correct it see this is the</text>
  <text start="388.73" dur="4.83">biggest problem there&amp;#39;s no way for them</text>
  <text start="390.83" dur="4.98">to correct this at all so they had to</text>
  <text start="393.56" dur="4.65">move all manufacturing out of this</text>
  <text start="395.81" dur="5.73">country and actually what was going to</text>
  <text start="398.21" dur="5.34">happen over time is that the United</text>
  <text start="401.54" dur="4.26">States would have no manufacturing and</text>
  <text start="403.55" dur="3.24">we would be brought down to the level of</text>
  <text start="405.8" dur="2.79">other countries</text>
  <text start="406.79" dur="4.68">we also would no longer be the reserve</text>
  <text start="408.59" dur="6.11">currency of the world and this was their</text>
  <text start="411.47" dur="5.7">plan now over time they moved a lot of</text>
  <text start="414.7" dur="5.32">manufacturing out of this country</text>
  <text start="417.17" dur="4.35">so people wouldn&amp;#39;t notice what was</text>
  <text start="420.02" dur="2.96">really going on yes the value of the</text>
  <text start="421.52" dur="3.96">dollar was still continually decreasing</text>
  <text start="422.98" dur="4.27">but we can see in in different areas I</text>
  <text start="425.48" dur="4.65">mean we could see that the housing</text>
  <text start="427.25" dur="5.34">prices were astronomically high college</text>
  <text start="430.13" dur="4.59">tuition was astronomically high to cover</text>
  <text start="432.59" dur="4.92">that up what they do you can take out</text>
  <text start="434.72" dur="3.84">loans for that automobiles you can take</text>
  <text start="437.51" dur="2.46">out loans but what happened with the</text>
  <text start="438.56" dur="3.12">world of mobiles in the beginning you</text>
  <text start="439.97" dur="3.39">started with that with cash then you</text>
  <text start="441.68" dur="4.08">went to financing then they had to</text>
  <text start="443.36" dur="4.47">extend the financing terms then you had</text>
  <text start="445.76" dur="5.13">to go to leasing so you can see how it</text>
  <text start="447.83" dur="4.56">was all breaking down over time real</text>
  <text start="450.89" dur="3.15">estate is a little bit trickier right</text>
  <text start="452.39" dur="4.38">now because</text>
  <text start="454.04" dur="5.46">real estate houses go up people feel</text>
  <text start="456.77" dur="4.14">comfortable when the prices go up</text>
  <text start="459.5" dur="3.87">because they have the appreciation in</text>
  <text start="460.91" dur="3.99">the homes but what happens is it gets</text>
  <text start="463.37" dur="3.03">out of the reach of everyday people</text>
  <text start="464.9" dur="3.96">especially those people who are graduate</text>
  <text start="466.4" dur="4.11">graduating college getting a job or now</text>
  <text start="468.86" dur="3.18">they can&amp;#39;t get a job because the economy</text>
  <text start="470.51" dur="3.36">is not doing that well where they get a</text>
  <text start="472.04" dur="2.97">low-paying job and then you start to</text>
  <text start="473.87" dur="3.24">notice that people aren&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="475.01" dur="5.1">purchasing homes so they had to</text>
  <text start="477.11" dur="4.83">manipulate this also where they brought</text>
  <text start="480.11" dur="5.52">down the interest rates to almost zero</text>
  <text start="481.94" dur="6.51">to allow investors to come in foreign</text>
  <text start="485.63" dur="5.16">buyers to come in and it looks like this</text>
  <text start="488.45" dur="5.46">is coming to an end if they continued</text>
  <text start="490.79" dur="5.97">with this approach the entire system</text>
  <text start="493.91" dur="4.92">would just implode on itself because</text>
  <text start="496.76" dur="5.7">people would continually lose jobs we&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="498.83" dur="6.03">have no manufacturing here and everyone</text>
  <text start="502.46" dur="4.92">would blame the Fed because the system</text>
  <text start="504.86" dur="5.01">just came to a screeching halt and they</text>
  <text start="507.38" dur="3.96">didn&amp;#39;t want this to happen so when Trump</text>
  <text start="509.87" dur="2.549">came into office what do they do they</text>
  <text start="511.34" dur="1.95">started to raise the interest rates</text>
  <text start="512.419" dur="3.421">because they thought they were gonna use</text>
  <text start="513.29" dur="4.59">this plan to blame it on Trump Trump</text>
  <text start="515.84" dur="4.68">took over what they were doing made the</text>
  <text start="517.88" dur="4.92">economy look fantastic and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="520.52" dur="4.77">in trouble but they&amp;#39;re still trying to</text>
  <text start="522.8" dur="4.2">push their agenda if we look at the</text>
  <text start="525.29" dur="3.15">housing market right now we see already</text>
  <text start="527" dur="4.14">the housing market is starting to roll</text>
  <text start="528.44" dur="5.91">over mortgage rates are hitting a</text>
  <text start="531.14" dur="5.73">seven-year high I mean they&amp;#39;re up to</text>
  <text start="534.35" dur="5.49">four point seven two percent last time</text>
  <text start="536.87" dur="5.25">we saw that was back in what 2012 2013</text>
  <text start="539.84" dur="4.86">around that area and before that period</text>
  <text start="542.12" dur="4.77">was right before the housing market came</text>
  <text start="544.7" dur="5.82">down and as they continually move up</text>
  <text start="546.89" dur="5.55">guess what it&amp;#39;s going to get worse and</text>
  <text start="550.52" dur="3.39">worse because it&amp;#39;s gonna push a lot of</text>
  <text start="552.44" dur="2.79">people out of the market people are</text>
  <text start="553.91" dur="4.68">gonna take their homes off the market</text>
  <text start="555.23" dur="5.67">and barring costs they get more and more</text>
  <text start="558.59" dur="5.7">expensive as time goes on and they know</text>
  <text start="560.9" dur="6.36">this is just a matter of time and this</text>
  <text start="564.29" dur="6">is why they&amp;#39;re pushing the idea that</text>
  <text start="567.26" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s all about the tariffs which is</text>
  <text start="570.29" dur="4.32">completely fake false and phony because</text>
  <text start="572.24" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;ve known from the past that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="574.61" dur="5.01">their system that is breaking down and</text>
  <text start="576.89" dur="5.97">they have no other way to explain why</text>
  <text start="579.62" dur="5.61">the system is breaking down especially</text>
  <text start="582.86" dur="3.36">when Trump took the economy manipulated</text>
  <text start="585.23" dur="2.43">a lot of the numbers which they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="586.22" dur="3.81">already been doing he just took what</text>
  <text start="587.66" dur="3.81">took just what they had before took it</text>
  <text start="590.03" dur="3.18">and manipulated to the enth degree to</text>
  <text start="591.47" dur="3.36">make it look really really great</text>
  <text start="593.21" dur="3.63">this way they couldn&amp;#39;t say anything</text>
  <text start="594.83" dur="4.08">about it but they&amp;#39;re using the retailers</text>
  <text start="596.84" dur="3.51">right now to say oh look what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="598.91" dur="3.36">happening it&amp;#39;s because of the tariffs</text>
  <text start="600.35" dur="3.72">this is why retails breaking down think</text>
  <text start="602.27" dur="4.08">about what they&amp;#39;ve done in the past they</text>
  <text start="604.07" dur="4.08">started out with the weather this is why</text>
  <text start="606.35" dur="3.84">retail is breaking down they used that</text>
  <text start="608.15" dur="4.26">for like two years or so two three years</text>
  <text start="610.19" dur="5.46">and then they went on to online sales</text>
  <text start="612.41" dur="6">now they&amp;#39;re on tariffs I mean just think</text>
  <text start="615.65" dur="5.04">of each phase that they&amp;#39;ve been using to</text>
  <text start="618.41" dur="4.23">explain why retail is not doing well</text>
  <text start="620.69" dur="6.75">remember if everything just moved to</text>
  <text start="622.64" dur="6.45">online we would see online equal to what</text>
