  <text start="127.619" dur="6.551">system is going to fall apart we have</text>
  <text start="130.03" dur="7.53">proof already look at Greece the central</text>
  <text start="134.17" dur="7.429">bankers told us back in two thousand</text>

  <text start="175.09" dur="9.509">we seeing well we&amp;#39;re seeing that tsipras</text>
  <text start="179.68" dur="9.95">is ready to accept most of the bet most</text>
  <text start="184.599" dur="7.951">of the bailout terms from Europe and</text>
  <text start="189.63" dur="4.84">Europe is looking at this thing yeah you</text>
  <text start="192.55" dur="3.06">know we&amp;#39;re not going to do anything at</text>
  <text start="194.47" dur="5.61">this point in time because i think the</text>
  <text start="195.61" dur="8.01">real agenda is to strangle greece to</text>
  <text start="200.08" dur="6.96">make the people suffer to show them that</text>
  <text start="203.62" dur="7.1">you don&amp;#39;t mess with the central bankers</text>

  <text start="210.72" dur="7.15">we&amp;#39;re going to suffocate your country</text>
  <text start="213.78" dur="7.78">until you give and i think part of their</text>
  <text start="217.87" dur="5.79">agenda is to remove tsipras and to show</text>
  <text start="221.56" dur="4.05">that people look see look what he did to</text>
  <text start="223.66" dur="4.98">your country let&amp;#39;s bring in the other</text>
  <text start="225.61" dur="6.51">leader that will cooperate with us that</text>
  <text start="228.64" dur="7.28">will do whatever we want and this is</text>
  <text start="232.12" dur="6.66">exactly what we are seeing right now</text>
  <text start="235.92" dur="6.159">zipper said he will not back down on the</text>
  <text start="238.78" dur="7.53">referendum he said he&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="242.079" dur="9.391">cancel it and he wants the people and he</text>
  <text start="246.31" dur="8.61">urges them for a no referendum he called</text>
  <text start="251.47" dur="7.62">on voters to reject austerity measures</text>
  <text start="254.92" dur="7.29">in Sunday&amp;#39;s referendum to help end the</text>
  <text start="259.09" dur="4.59">standoff with creditors come Monday the</text>
  <text start="262.21" dur="3.179">Greek government will be at the</text>
  <text start="263.68" dur="4.7">negotiating table after the referendum</text>
  <text start="265.389" dur="6.361">with better terms for the Greek people</text>
  <text start="268.38" dur="5.14">tsipras calls for a no vote Greece</text>
  <text start="271.75" dur="4.47">receives a better proposals for dead</text>
  <text start="273.52" dur="5.31">after referendum call super says</text>
  <text start="276.22" dur="6.27">government fighting to protect people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="278.83" dur="8.25">pensions super says no vote is decisive</text>
  <text start="282.49" dur="8.72">step toward better deal and most likely</text>
  <text start="287.08" dur="9.69">it probably is but we have to remember</text>
  <text start="291.21" dur="7.84">those people and I say the people I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="296.77" dur="7.03">talking about the central bankers</text>
  <text start="299.05" dur="8.2">the powers that be they might you know</text>
  <text start="303.8" dur="5.489">try to alter the voting they might try</text>
  <text start="307.25" dur="4.889">to bring in or sneak in some ballots</text>
  <text start="309.289" dur="6.961">there that might have a yes to go with</text>
  <text start="312.139" dur="7.771">the creditors proposals we see the greek</text>
  <text start="316.25" dur="6.63">Finance Minister Vera Fox he says</text>
  <text start="319.91" dur="6.08">there&amp;#39;s here are some reasons why you</text>
  <text start="322.88" dur="5.43">should just say no to the troika</text>
  <text start="325.99" dur="5.399">negotiations have stalled because</text>
  <text start="328.31" dur="6.69">Greece&amp;#39;s creditors refuse to reduce our</text>
  <text start="331.389" dur="7.78">unpayable public debt insisted that it</text>
  <text start="335" dur="7.47">should be repaid no matter what happens</text>
  <text start="339.169" dur="5.881">to the people they don&amp;#39;t care they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="342.47" dur="6.33">care what happens to the children to the</text>
  <text start="345.05" dur="6">grandchildren they don&amp;#39;t care if people</text>
  <text start="348.8" dur="5.19">are struggling they just want their</text>
  <text start="351.05" dur="6.72">money even if it&amp;#39;s odious debt where</text>
  <text start="353.99" dur="6.989">this debt was created illegally he says</text>
  <text start="357.77" dur="4.88">the debt must be restructured yeah</text>
  <text start="360.979" dur="5.611">because if they continue like this</text>
  <text start="362.65" dur="6.73">Greece has no economic growth the next</text>
  <text start="366.59" dur="6.12">generation is going to suffer worse than</text>
  <text start="369.38" dur="7.56">what&amp;#39;s happening right now the Eurogroup</text>
  <text start="372.71" dur="6.12">had previously on average 2012 conceded</text>
  <text start="376.94" dur="4.86">that the debt ought to be restructured</text>
  <text start="378.83" dur="6.889">but is refusing to commit to a debt</text>
  <text start="381.8" dur="8.13">restructure again they want grease to</text>
  <text start="385.719" dur="6.01">suffer they want to show the people they</text>
  <text start="389.93" dur="5.549">need to replace the government this is</text>
  <text start="391.729" dur="5.361">what they&amp;#39;re pushing right now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="395.479" dur="4.771">saying that Greece will stay in the euro</text>
  <text start="397.09" dur="5.44">the current impasse is due to this</text>
  <text start="400.25" dur="4.08">choice by the creditors and not by the</text>
  <text start="402.53" dur="4.41">Greek government discontinuing the goat</text>
  <text start="404.33" dur="7.23">the negotiations or any Greek thoughts</text>
  <text start="406.94" dur="6.81">of Greek exit and devaluation he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="411.56" dur="5.94">saying that Greece&amp;#39;s place is in the</text>
  <text start="413.75" dur="6.289">eurozone but again we have to watch the</text>
  <text start="417.5" dur="5.789">actions and not what these government</text>
  <text start="420.039" dur="5.831">employees say because again they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="423.289" dur="5.461">already made a deal with Russia for the</text>
  <text start="425.87" dur="5.71">Turkish gas pipeline and if they stay</text>
  <text start="428.75" dur="4.99">with Europe and they come out with</text>
  <text start="431.58" dur="4.7">type of deal unless this is included in</text>
  <text start="433.74" dur="4.62">the deal which most likely it won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="436.28" dur="6.58">they&amp;#39;re going to tell them to cancel</text>
  <text start="438.36" dur="7.679">that agreement with Russia and this is</text>
  <text start="442.86" dur="6.98">going to cause a problem we see the</text>
  <text start="446.039" dur="8.391">banks opened up for a little while a</text>
  <text start="449.84" dur="8.229">thousand Greek branches chanced the</text>
  <text start="454.43" dur="7.09">opening of their doors and there was a</text>
  <text start="458.069" dur="5.85">stampede of older people looking to get</text>
  <text start="461.52" dur="5.31">their pension money&amp;#39;s lines formed out</text>
  <text start="463.919" dur="6.3">the banks people were pushing and</text>
  <text start="466.83" dur="4.679">shoving they wanted their money again</text>
  <text start="470.219" dur="3.63">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a</text>
  <text start="471.509" dur="5.071">collapse of Greece we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="473.849" dur="6.181">store shelves completely empty we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="476.58" dur="6.239">saying people running to get fuel people</text>
  <text start="480.03" dur="6.449">trying to get cash people trying to get</text>
  <text start="482.819" dur="8.28">supplies this is what it&amp;#39;s going to look</text>
  <text start="486.479" dur="8.19">like now take this and multiply it out</text>
  <text start="491.099" dur="6.511">when the entire system comes crumbling</text>
  <text start="494.669" dur="5.451">down what do you think the world is</text>
  <text start="497.61" dur="6.779">going to look like where do you go at</text>
  <text start="500.12" dur="7.539">this point if each country is having the</text>
  <text start="504.389" dur="5.7">same problem and people are now rioting</text>
  <text start="507.659" dur="6.331">because they&amp;#39;re hearing that every</text>
  <text start="510.089" dur="5.7">country is going through this this is a</text>
  <text start="513.99" dur="7.409">good this is going to be a complete</text>
  <text start="515.789" dur="9.331">disaster and we see that out of leaked</text>
  <text start="521.399" dur="7.891">documents leaked IMF documents that</text>
  <text start="525.12" dur="5.94">austerity is not enough to save Greece</text>
  <text start="529.29" dur="4.109">even if Greece accepted all the</text>
  <text start="531.06" dur="6.889">austerity measures demanded by the</text>
  <text start="533.399" dur="7.831">creditors the troika the central bankers</text>
  <text start="537.949" dur="7.121">it still would not be able to make ends</text>
  <text start="541.23" dur="6.66">meet by 2030 and this is according to</text>
  <text start="545.07" dur="4.68">the IMF estimates revealed in a set of</text>
  <text start="547.89" dur="5.03">documents obtained by the by a German</text>
  <text start="549.75" dur="6.36">newspaper the most optimistic scenario</text>
  <text start="552.92" dur="6.729">shows that Greece&amp;#39;s decision not to</text>
  <text start="556.11" dur="6.87">accept the bailout deal is the best</text>
  <text start="559.649" dur="5.721">decision right now they prove that for</text>
  <text start="562.98" dur="5.96">Greece to survive economically it needs</text>
  <text start="565.37" dur="9.75">real debt relief measures not austerity</text>
  <text start="568.94" dur="9">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is this</text>
  <text start="575.12" dur="5.159">is exactly what they need they need to</text>
  <text start="577.94" dur="7.11">get rid of the debt more austerity and</text>
  <text start="580.279" dur="7.431">more debt brings what brings hardship to</text>
  <text start="585.05" dur="7.55">the people it does not bring economic</text>
  <text start="587.71" dur="7.87">growth it does not spur economic growth</text>
  <text start="592.6" dur="7.33">it makes the next generation unemployed</text>
  <text start="595.58" dur="8.1">it makes people angry and it keeps the</text>
  <text start="599.93" dur="7.97">government in debt going nowhere there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="603.68" dur="7.14">no revenue coming into the country and</text>
  <text start="607.9" dur="5.77">we understand there&amp;#39;s protests going on</text>
  <text start="610.82" dur="5.3">inside of Greece and what&amp;#39;s very strange</text>
  <text start="613.67" dur="6.63">is the people are out there saying yes</text>
  <text start="616.12" dur="6.94">vote yes vote yes now think about this</text>
  <text start="620.3" dur="7.32">for a second what they&amp;#39;re really saying</text>
  <text start="623.06" dur="10.68">is we want more austerity we want our</text>
  <text start="627.62" dur="10.23">jobs cancelled we want to struggle we</text>
  <text start="633.74" dur="7.5">want more debt in the country we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="637.85" dur="6.33">want things to get better it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="641.24" dur="5.13">make sense and when they interviewed one</text>
  <text start="644.18" dur="5.01">of the protesters who were chanting yes</text>
  <text start="646.37" dur="5.06">yes yes let&amp;#39;s stay in the euro the</text>
  <text start="649.19" dur="4.71">response was totally off the wall a</text>
  <text start="651.43" dur="4.57">woman responds that she knows that</text>
  <text start="653.9" dur="5.309">ninety-five percent of Greeks will be</text>
  <text start="656" dur="4.98">hurt but it&amp;#39;s only in the European Union</text>
  <text start="659.209" dur="6.721">that legal democratic processes are</text>
  <text start="660.98" dur="7.35">guaranteed what you can tell that this</text>
  <text start="665.93" dur="6.17">whole thing where people are chanting</text>
  <text start="668.33" dur="9.15">yes yes yes is completely put together</text>
  <text start="672.1" dur="7.96">to try to persuade people to stay in the</text>
  <text start="677.48" dur="7.109">euro to go with the creditors proposals</text>
  <text start="680.06" dur="6.63">to keep the creditors prosperous this is</text>
  <text start="684.589" dur="3.271">why they&amp;#39;re pushing this they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="686.69" dur="3.57">about the people in like I said there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="687.86" dur="5.22">many many times before the central</text>
  <text start="690.26" dur="5.19">bankers have no allegiance whatsoever to</text>
  <text start="693.08" dur="6.12">a people or to a country they could care</text>
  <text start="695.45" dur="7.14">less and what&amp;#39;s very interesting eh</text>
  <text start="699.2" dur="6.48">when report has come out that set that</text>
  <text start="702.59" dur="6.3">says that austerity does absolutely</text>
  <text start="705.68" dur="6.03">nothing actually it condemns children to</text>
  <text start="708.89" dur="8.07">poverty now think about that for a</text>
  <text start="711.71" dur="9.39">second austerity condemns children to</text>
  <text start="716.96" dur="7.59">poverty the next generation will be kept</text>
  <text start="721.1" dur="5.63">in poverty under the control of the</text>
  <text start="724.55" dur="4.77">central bankers this is what they want</text>
  <text start="726.73" dur="4.84">in a report for the United Nations the</text>
  <text start="729.32" dur="5.7">commissioners say austerity policies</text>
  <text start="731.57" dur="5.85">policies have already pushed 2.3 million</text>
  <text start="735.02" dur="6.5">children into poverty with the figure</text>
  <text start="737.42" dur="7.23">set to hit about 4.7 million by 2020</text>
  <text start="741.52" dur="5.05">child poverty rates remain unacceptably</text>
  <text start="744.65" dur="4.14">high according to the commissioners</text>
  <text start="746.57" dur="3.81">assessment the first full-scale review</text>
  <text start="748.79" dur="4.32">in seven years and they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="750.38" dur="6.27">this in the UK and in many other</text>
  <text start="753.11" dur="8.21">countries and they are seeing that the</text>
  <text start="756.65" dur="9.27">next generation are going to be poor</text>
  <text start="761.32" dur="7.66">people which makes it easier for these</text>
  <text start="765.92" dur="5.19">central bankers to control this is what</text>
  <text start="768.98" dur="6.3">they like this is what they&amp;#39;re aiming</text>
  <text start="771.11" dur="5.85">for now we understand that Greece is</text>
  <text start="775.28" dur="3.96">going to have a referendum and of course</text>
  <text start="776.96" dur="4.44">you&amp;#39;re a preserver out there the Council</text>
  <text start="779.24" dur="4.83">of Europe finds that the Greek</text>
  <text start="781.4" dur="4.02">referendum is below international</text>
  <text start="784.07" dur="2.61">standards because they&amp;#39;re very worried</text>
  <text start="785.42" dur="3.93">that this is going to come up with a no</text>
  <text start="786.68" dur="8.58">vote that they&amp;#39;re not going to go along</text>

  <text start="859.9" dur="4.9">he said it is too early to unveil the</text>

  <text start="868.07" dur="6.75">happen after the referendum but there is</text>
  <text start="871.07" dur="6.39">a plan B and I&amp;#39;m just curious in what</text>
  <text start="874.82" dur="3.75">this plan B could be now it could be any</text>

  <text start="1387.83" dur="5.46">we&amp;#39;re seeing a completely different</text>

  <text start="1404.48" dur="7.71">cost of the food has gone up in the last</text>
  <text start="1408.11" dur="7.08">ten years by thirty percent even in just</text>
  <text start="1412.19" dur="5.73">the past year prices on many items have</text>
  <text start="1415.19" dur="4.89">risen beef is up by 7.3 percent lettuce</text>

  <text start="1422.99" dur="9.15">three-point-six percent even soda ticked</text>
  <text start="1427.85" dur="5.52">up by point nine percent so when we look</text>
  <text start="1432.14" dur="3.09">at this and the government continually</text>
  <text start="1433.37" dur="4.83">tells us we don&amp;#39;t see any inflation it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1435.23" dur="6.39">not difficult for the people yeah it is</text>
  <text start="1438.2" dur="6.09">actually the elderly definitely see it</text>
  <text start="1441.62" dur="4.8">and feel it this is why they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1444.29" dur="4.889">survive on their pensions this is why</text>
  <text start="1446.42" dur="4.65">you see them out working at the</text>
  <text start="1449.179" dur="4.88">part-time jobs they&amp;#39;re trying to keep up</text>
  <text start="1451.07" dur="7.14">with the cost of food with the cost of</text>

  <text start="1458.21" dur="4.44">lot of it is masked but the cost is</text>
  <text start="1461.36" dur="4.98">still going up and what I mean by that</text>
  <text start="1462.65" dur="5.34">is a lot of the products shrink a lot of</text>
  <text start="1466.34" dur="5.85">the ingredients in the products have</text>
  <text start="1467.99" dur="6.27">been changed and it seems like it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1472.19" dur="4.64">same price but you&amp;#39;re really getting</text>

  <text start="1533.45" dur="5.88">are fantastic things are getting better</text>
  <text start="1535.85" dur="7.2">but when we look back in May we see that</text>
  <text start="1539.33" dur="6.8">contracts actually fell by</text>
  <text start="1543.05" dur="5.4">two-point-three percent in May and</text>
  <text start="1546.13" dur="5.65">that&amp;#39;s the actual number it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1548.45" dur="8.04">seasonally adjusted and this tells us</text>
  <text start="1551.78" dur="6.96">that the real estate industry is not</text>
  <text start="1556.49" dur="4.11">doing as well as everyone believes</text>

  <text start="1680" dur="6.24">hit hard and it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="1683.24" dur="5.57">devastating to a lot of people and we</text>

  <text start="1706.43" dur="5.76">and this is why they pushed out common</text>

  <text start="1712.19" dur="5.7">students to read less literature and</text>

  <text start="1783.83" dur="6.81">very interesting why would they do that</text>
  <text start="1788.17" dur="5.5">well what&amp;#39;s the difference between the</text>
  <text start="1790.64" dur="7.32">two and when we look at the difference</text>
  <text start="1793.67" dur="7.47">ah it becomes clear the direct larae</text>

  <text start="2032.85" dur="6.09">you know flew into the White House area</text>
  <text start="2035.82" dur="5.46">and they started making law saying no it</text>
  <text start="2038.94" dur="4.05">can be no drones whatsoever and this was</text>
  <text start="2041.28" dur="3.48">all done on purpose because what do they</text>
  <text start="2042.99" dur="5.22">wanted to do is they wanted to make</text>
  <text start="2044.76" dur="5.22">Washington a no drone zone and this is</text>
  <text start="2048.21" dur="3.42">exactly what they did the US government</text>
  <text start="2049.98" dur="9.21">announced that the skies over Washington</text>
  <text start="2051.63" dur="9.69">DC was a no drone zone and no person can</text>
  <text start="2059.19" dur="4.74">operate an unmanned aircraft in the area</text>
  <text start="2061.32" dur="4.59">it was completely illegal and this goes</text>
  <text start="2063.93" dur="4.38">for all the communities surrounding</text>
  <text start="2065.91" dur="4.8">Washington DC so there&amp;#39;s no drones</text>

  <text start="2070.71" dur="4.8">a drone to this area it is completely</text>
  <text start="2073.23" dur="4.44">illegal and you will be fined or</text>
  <text start="2075.51" dur="4.68">arrested and they did this on purpose</text>
  <text start="2077.67" dur="7.65">because they realize eventually when the</text>
  <text start="2080.19" dur="6.93">people get angry enough they will storm</text>
  <text start="2085.32" dur="3.69">the White House they will storm the</text>

  <text start="2406.95" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;ll go back into those later and</text>
  <text start="2408.42" dur="4.44">restore the puppet regimes but this is</text>
  <text start="2411.87" dur="4.56">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do this whole</text>
  <text start="2412.86" dur="8.37">thing is to take control of Iran and</text>

  <text start="2437.07" dur="3.18">why they&amp;#39;re doing this because you know</text>
  <text start="2438.84" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re getting ready to go back into</text>
  <text start="2440.25" dur="6.36">Libya they&amp;#39;re trying to make the case on</text>
  <text start="2442.56" dur="5.43">how they can get in there and we know</text>
  <text start="2446.61" dur="2.7">that the United States just can&amp;#39;t go in</text>
  <text start="2447.99" dur="3.96">there they using the proxy army of the</text>
  <text start="2449.31" dur="4.2">Saudi Arabia to fight in Yemen to</text>
  <text start="2451.95" dur="3.06">restore the puppet government because</text>
  <text start="2453.51" dur="4.71">right now the United States doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="2455.01" dur="5.46">the authorization for war Congress is</text>
  <text start="2458.22" dur="5.55">not even looking at it the people are</text>
  <text start="2460.47" dur="6.3">not motivated to pass the authorization</text>
  <text start="2463.77" dur="5.61">for or even call for it and this is why</text>
  <text start="2466.77" dur="6.12">we will most likely will see a major</text>
  <text start="2469.38" dur="6.32">major event coming soon now the Human</text>
  <text start="2472.89" dur="5.34">Rights Watch release findings on Tuesday</text>
  <text start="2475.7" dur="5.23">detailing the devastating consequences</text>
  <text start="2478.23" dur="4.98">of the air strikes in Yemen they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2480.93" dur="4.59">hitting a lot of infrastructure they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2483.21" dur="4.32">hitting resonance and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="2485.52" dur="3.39">that the United States is responsible</text>
  <text start="2487.53" dur="3.51">for this because they refuel the jets</text>
  <text start="2488.91" dur="4.37">they point out the targets and of course</text>
  <text start="2491.04" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re orchestrating everything and</text>
  <text start="2493.28" dur="4.66">right now they&amp;#39;re launching an</text>
  <text start="2495.75" dur="7.14">investigation into what is going on here</text>
  <text start="2497.94" dur="7.53">and the people are saying that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="2502.89" dur="5.49">potentially is liable for all of this</text>
  <text start="2505.47" dur="8.28">and of course they are what is the</text>
  <text start="2508.38" dur="8.16">reason to go into Yemen the people rose</text>
  <text start="2513.75" dur="4.86">up they threw out the puppet regime and</text>
  <text start="2516.54" dur="4.26">they said we want our country back then</text>
  <text start="2518.61" dur="5.4">Saudi Arabia who was never attacked came</text>
  <text start="2520.8" dur="6.96">in and decide to decided the bomb Yemen</text>
  <text start="2524.01" dur="9.33">out of nowhere so they invaded a</text>
  <text start="2527.76" dur="9.15">sovereign country and the US is backing</text>
  <text start="2533.34" dur="7.11">them we see how this is all playing out</text>
  <text start="2536.91" dur="6.81">the proxy army of the u.s. Israel and UK</text>
  <text start="2540.45" dur="5.43">and you know who I&amp;#39;m talking about and I</text>
  <text start="2543.72" dur="3.78">call them the proxy army now is saying</text>
  <text start="2545.88" dur="4.68">that they want to throw out Hamas in</text>
  <text start="2547.5" dur="6">Gaza so let&amp;#39;s think about this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2550.56" dur="8.43">going into Gaza and they want to take</text>
  <text start="2553.5" dur="9.17">over that area now this is to make it</text>
  <text start="2558.99" dur="6.15">look like they need to go into Gaza and</text>
  <text start="2562.67" dur="3.639">it looks like Israel is definitely</text>
  <text start="2565.14" dur="3.929">getting ready to move</text>
  <text start="2566.309" dur="7.2">move back into Gaza and start the war</text>
  <text start="2569.069" dur="7.95">there and use it to then move into Syria</text>
  <text start="2573.509" dur="8.58">two agendas going on at the same exact</text>
  <text start="2577.019" dur="8.07">time now out west we see that the FBI is</text>
  <text start="2582.089" dur="5.341">investigating 11 11 attacks on San</text>
  <text start="2585.089" dur="5.341">Francisco area internet lines they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2587.43" dur="6.299">saying they were mysteriously cut and if</text>
  <text start="2590.43" dur="6.21">we go back in time to the power</text>
  <text start="2593.729" dur="5.07">infrastructure that was shot up and</text>
  <text start="2596.64" dur="4.949">those lines were cut they never found</text>
  <text start="2598.799" dur="4.68">those people we see the same thing as</text>
  <text start="2601.589" dur="3.63">happening right now so we see physical</text>
  <text start="2603.479" dur="4.01">attacks on the power infrastructure and</text>
  <text start="2605.219" dur="6.33">fizzle physical attacks on high-capacity</text>
  <text start="2607.489" dur="6.34">internet cables now either this was a</text>
  <text start="2611.549" dur="4.65">training mission to see if how this</text>
  <text start="2613.829" dur="4.26">would affect the area they could pull it</text>
  <text start="2616.199" dur="5.84">off without anyone seeing and it worked</text>
  <text start="2618.089" dur="9.841">out perfectly and this is all being</text>
  <text start="2622.039" dur="9.01">created and pushed for the next event</text>
  <text start="2627.93" dur="6.359">and you can see all these really strange</text>
  <text start="2631.049" dur="5.46">things are occurring right now which</text>
  <text start="2634.289" dur="4.89">everyone&amp;#39;s scratching their head why</text>
  <text start="2636.509" dur="5.22">would this happen what benefit does</text>
  <text start="2639.179" dur="4.65">someone get by cutting the internet</text>
  <text start="2641.729" dur="8.64">lines think about it for a second not</text>
  <text start="2643.829" dur="8.311">just 111 physical attacks so you can see</text>
  <text start="2650.369" dur="5.73">something is definitely being prepared</text>
  <text start="2652.14" dur="5.219">and readied we see the FBI is out there</text>
  <text start="2656.099" dur="4.38">and they&amp;#39;re continually giving us</text>
  <text start="2657.359" dur="5.4">warnings about this fourth of July that</text>
  <text start="2660.479" dur="4.921">something could happen we might see some</text>
  <text start="2662.759" dur="5.43">type of an event and they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="2665.4" dur="6.419">that they&amp;#39;re telling the people that</text>
  <text start="2668.189" dur="7.29">friends and family should avoid July 4th</text>
  <text start="2671.819" dur="5.341">celebrations the FBI canceled all their</text>
  <text start="2675.479" dur="4.2">vacations and they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="2677.16" dur="6.809">setting up command centers around the</text>
  <text start="2679.679" dur="7.56">country the NYPD is on high alert now we</text>
  <text start="2683.969" dur="5.1">might see some type of an event because</text>
  <text start="2687.239" dur="3.63">as we know the economy is definitely</text>
  <text start="2689.069" dur="4.591">falling apart things are getting worse</text>
  <text start="2690.869" dur="6.33">it&amp;#39;s accelerating we see what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="2693.66" dur="6.06">in Greece the central bankers might be</text>
  <text start="2697.199" dur="4.791">getting a little worried at this point</text>
  <text start="2699.72" dur="4.379">so this might have two agendas right now</text>
  <text start="2701.99" dur="6.34">everything might be positioning for the</text>
  <text start="2704.099" dur="7.441">event and we can see that the first part</text>
  <text start="2708.33" dur="5.519">is they&amp;#39;re trying to get people away</text>
  <text start="2711.54" dur="5.51">from celebrating their independence</text>
  <text start="2713.849" dur="5.341">their independence from the government</text>
  <text start="2717.05" dur="4.39">from a British government or the</text>
  <text start="2719.19" dur="5.1">independence from the federal government</text>
  <text start="2721.44" dur="8.22">the second agenda if they get the green</text>
  <text start="2724.29" dur="9.809">light is to push the event and start it</text>
  <text start="2729.66" dur="6.03">now in the month of July and this would</text>
  <text start="2734.099" dur="3.151">definitely push the authorization for</text>
  <text start="2735.69" dur="5.04">war depending on what group they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2737.25" dur="6.38">going to use and what type of attack</text>
  <text start="2740.73" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re going to use here in the country</text>
  <text start="2743.63" dur="4.84">and we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch the</text>
  <text start="2745.92" dur="8.04">situation very very carefully I&amp;#39;m more</text>
  <text start="2748.47" dur="9.78">leaning towards the controlling the</text>
  <text start="2753.96" dur="7.77">crowds controlling people celebrating</text>
  <text start="2758.25" dur="5.28">their independence then the event but</text>
  <text start="2761.73" dur="5.31">this could change as we get closer and</text>
  <text start="2763.53" dur="4.46">closer to the fourth of July I think</text>
  <text start="2767.04" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re just trying to keep people</text>
  <text start="2767.99" dur="4.66">scared and afraid that something will</text>
  <text start="2771.3" dur="2.7">occur because it&amp;#39;s all over the press</text>
  <text start="2772.65" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s all over the corporate media and</text>
  <text start="2774" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;re really pushing this hard but</text>
  <text start="2777.27" dur="4.41">again we&amp;#39;ll have to watch the situation</text>
  <text start="2779.58" dur="3.75">very closely we&amp;#39;ll have to look at the</text>
  <text start="2781.68" dur="3.3">indicators and I notice things have</text>
  <text start="2783.33" dur="4.83">definitely ramped up because now we have</text>
  <text start="2784.98" dur="8.25">command centers being spread out across</text>
  <text start="2788.16" dur="8.31">the country FBI is on call NYPD is on</text>
  <text start="2793.23" dur="6.15">high alert so they might be planning</text>
  <text start="2796.47" dur="5.16">something very big listen everyone</text>
