  <text start="58.42" dur="5.01">system is collapsing at this time and we</text>
  <text start="61.48" dur="4.41">saw the markets at one point they were</text>
  <text start="63.43" dur="4.71">almost down eleven hundred points and</text>
  <text start="65.89" dur="5.22">then we saw the markets being pumped up</text>
  <text start="68.14" dur="5.76">again but it really doesn&amp;#39;t matter at</text>
  <text start="71.11" dur="7.38">this point because what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="73.9" dur="7.44">a complete collapse of the system and as</text>
  <text start="78.49" dur="5.61">this system continually deteriorates and</text>
  <text start="81.34" dur="4.59">rip apart it&amp;#39;s going to get worse as</text>
  <text start="84.1" dur="4.049">time goes on it&amp;#39;s not going to get</text>

  <text start="119.32" dur="10.639">up this is why we are seeing all of this</text>
  <text start="124.99" dur="9.27">the entire system which is basically</text>
  <text start="129.959" dur="8.231">created by issuing debt more and more</text>
  <text start="134.26" dur="5.64">debt to countries and then stealing of</text>
  <text start="138.19" dur="4.74">course their natural resources this</text>
  <text start="139.9" dur="7.97">entire system is based on the petro</text>
  <text start="142.93" dur="9.18">dollar system which is falling apart and</text>
  <text start="147.87" dur="7.03">if we look at the economic indicators</text>
  <text start="152.11" dur="5.34">like we&amp;#39;ve been looking at we knew all</text>
  <text start="154.9" dur="6.839">this time leading up to this point that</text>
  <text start="157.45" dur="6.42">this was going to happen now every day</text>
  <text start="161.739" dur="2.731">that I do this it&amp;#39;s not to say oh look</text>

  <text start="179.83" dur="6.06">whose fault it was yes it&amp;#39;s easier to</text>
  <text start="184.18" dur="3.51">look back in history and say oh this is</text>
  <text start="185.89" dur="4.89">the way it unfolded but while it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="187.69" dur="5.28">happening it&amp;#39;s very difficult to see it</text>

  <text start="485.12" dur="6.76">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all of</text>
  <text start="487.169" dur="7.8">this is that we saw this back in 1929 in</text>
  <text start="491.88" dur="6.629">August where the market had a small</text>
  <text start="494.969" dur="6.241">correction and everyone believed that</text>
  <text start="498.509" dur="5.071">everything was fine everyone believed it</text>
  <text start="501.21" dur="6.06">was all over this was the correction we</text>

  <text start="517.74" dur="3.33">do is they were trying to pump this up</text>
  <text start="519.539" dur="2.641">now they might do this by the end of the</text>
  <text start="521.07" dur="3.9">week they might be able to pump this</text>
  <text start="522.18" dur="5.79">right back up people say okay that was</text>
  <text start="524.97" dur="7.02">the correction well this is the</text>
  <text start="527.97" dur="6.75">beginning this is showing you what is</text>
  <text start="531.99" dur="4.5">coming and how bad it&amp;#39;s going to get</text>
  <text start="534.72" dur="4.679">when this thing comes crumbling down I</text>
  <text start="536.49" dur="4.8">mean I saw on market watch it says the</text>
  <text start="539.399" dur="5.161">American people because of this market</text>
  <text start="541.29" dur="6.51">downturn have lost 1.8 trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="544.56" dur="6.42">and of course we already see that</text>
  <text start="547.8" dur="4.61">they&amp;#39;re blaming this on China remember</text>
  <text start="550.98" dur="4.14">what I said they need a scapegoat</text>
  <text start="552.41" dur="5.71">they&amp;#39;re looking for someone to blame</text>
  <text start="555.12" dur="6.36">because of China this is why this is</text>
  <text start="558.12" dur="5.82">happening but we know this is not why</text>
  <text start="561.48" dur="3.469">it&amp;#39;s happening what is really happening</text>
  <text start="563.94" dur="5.959">here</text>
  <text start="564.949" dur="8.711">well it is the death of the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="569.899" dur="7.781">there is a seismic shift that began late</text>
  <text start="573.66" dur="8.46">last year it&amp;#39;s the death of the petro</text>
  <text start="577.68" dur="9.349">dollar and basically what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="582.12" dur="10.139">right now is that the petro dollar is</text>
  <text start="587.029" dur="7.06">pretty much dead the world seems to have</text>

  <text start="624" dur="8.639">flow of the petro dollar was set to dry</text>
  <text start="627.3" dur="11.13">up and we&amp;#39;re seeing that countries right</text>
  <text start="632.639" dur="9.18">now are stepping away from it and the</text>

  <text start="1086.51" dur="3.21">haven&amp;#39;t made their payment within 360</text>
  <text start="1088.91" dur="3.78">days because that&amp;#39;s the government</text>
  <text start="1089.72" dur="6.3">threshold if you look at 180 days it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1092.69" dur="4.74">double that number so now they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1096.02" dur="2.67">to modify your payment on how much</text>

  <text start="1114.08" dur="5.46">can&amp;#39;t be done they were trying to do</text>
  <text start="1118.04" dur="4.86">this but it can&amp;#39;t be done at this point</text>
  <text start="1119.54" dur="6.63">we saw the auto loan industry accept</text>
  <text start="1122.9" dur="6.09">everyone who had a heartbeat to pump it</text>
  <text start="1126.17" dur="5.22">up manufacturers were manufacturing like</text>

  <text start="1131.39" dur="7.38">auto industry dealership lots to make it</text>
  <text start="1135.5" dur="4.5">look like they&amp;#39;re manufacturing and then</text>
  <text start="1138.77" dur="2.73">they were just given the car as a way to</text>
  <text start="1140" dur="4.71">make it look like they had sales and</text>
  <text start="1141.5" dur="7.5">they accepted anybody that walk through</text>
  <text start="1144.71" dur="5.4">the door and we see most of the cars</text>
  <text start="1149" dur="6.57">that were purchased were from the</text>
  <text start="1150.11" dur="8.43">government not even by the people so</text>
