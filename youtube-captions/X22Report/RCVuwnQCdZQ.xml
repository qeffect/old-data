  <text start="151.08" dur="6.48">cuts to allow him to move forward</text>
  <text start="154.379" dur="5.551">without it he would be in a whole lot of</text>

  <text start="183.54" dur="5.43">good story to tell we have unemployment</text>
  <text start="185.73" dur="5.009">lower than we&amp;#39;ve seen in decades we have</text>
  <text start="188.97" dur="4.439">people who stopped looking for work</text>

  <text start="196.29" dur="5.759">at MSNBC do you believe now something he</text>
  <text start="200.01" dur="4.41">said here that is very interesting he</text>

  <text start="204.42" dur="4.08">for work are coming back into the labor</text>
  <text start="206.67" dur="3.929">force and remember we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="208.5" dur="4.889">about this for a very long time those</text>
  <text start="210.599" dur="5.551">people who couldn&amp;#39;t find a job they</text>
  <text start="213.389" dur="4.35">stopped looking and guess what happened</text>
  <text start="216.15" dur="4.83">they didn&amp;#39;t they weren&amp;#39;t counted anymore</text>
  <text start="217.739" dur="4.62">on the unemployment statistics and what</text>
  <text start="220.98" dur="3.599">he&amp;#39;s saying is since he&amp;#39;s bringing back</text>
  <text start="222.359" dur="4.201">manufacturing jobs and bringing jobs</text>
  <text start="224.579" dur="4.59">back to the United States these people</text>
  <text start="226.56" dur="5.7">they have the ability now to look for a</text>
  <text start="229.169" dur="4.591">job and actually get one now is this</text>
  <text start="232.26" dur="3.36">going to cover the whole entire nation</text>
  <text start="233.76" dur="4.08">is everyone&amp;#39;s going is everyone going to</text>
  <text start="235.62" dur="5.61">be employed no this is the beginning</text>
  <text start="237.84" dur="6.179">stages he&amp;#39;s been doing this to bring the</text>
  <text start="241.23" dur="6.24">economy to where it needs to be for the</text>
  <text start="244.019" dur="6.241">transition but you&amp;#39;re going to see a lot</text>
  <text start="247.47" dur="6.329">of positive things happen while he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="250.26" dur="7.529">doing this because he needs to have both</text>
  <text start="253.799" dur="6.18">systems running at the same time to make</text>
  <text start="257.789" dur="5.521">the switchover actually if you go back</text>
  <text start="259.979" dur="6.541">to the 70s prior to the 70s we actually</text>
  <text start="263.31" dur="7.95">had two systems running at the same time</text>
  <text start="266.52" dur="7.29">the new Petro central bank dollar system</text>
  <text start="271.26" dur="6.029">which they were creating and the gold</text>
  <text start="273.81" dur="6.45">back system which we were in and they</text>
  <text start="277.289" dur="5.16">switched us in the seventies the problem</text>
  <text start="280.26" dur="6.99">there is that we were going from a sound</text>
  <text start="282.449" dur="7.201">money system to a petrol dollar system</text>
  <text start="287.25" dur="5.58">where the central bank could create as</text>
  <text start="289.65" dur="5.04">much currency as they wanted and the</text>
  <text start="292.83" dur="4.859">government could borrow as much as they</text>
  <text start="294.69" dur="4.92">wanted which meant we saw the</text>
  <text start="297.689" dur="3.87">you might&amp;#39;ve inflation interest rates</text>
  <text start="299.61" dur="5.22">how to go higher people couldn&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="301.559" dur="6.6">jobs and the transition wasn&amp;#39;t as smooth</text>
  <text start="304.83" dur="5.639">as they thought it was going to be and</text>
  <text start="308.159" dur="4.41">do they really care at that point no</text>
  <text start="310.469" dur="3.15">they really didn&amp;#39;t Trump tweeted out</text>
  <text start="312.569" dur="4.95">another tweet</text>
  <text start="313.619" dur="6.39">since Election Day 2016 stocks up almost</text>
  <text start="317.519" dur="4.77">50% stocks gained nine point two</text>
  <text start="320.009" dur="4.8">trillion dollars in value and more than</text>
  <text start="322.289" dur="5.46">five million new jobs added to the</text>
  <text start="324.809" dur="5.01">economy at Lou Dobbs if our opponent had</text>
  <text start="327.749" dur="3.81">won there would have been a market crash</text>
  <text start="329.819" dur="5.37">plain and simple</text>
  <text start="331.559" dur="7.32">and he&amp;#39;s absolutely right he&amp;#39;s telling</text>
  <text start="335.189" dur="6.45">everyone the way it really is if there</text>
  <text start="338.879" dur="8.06">was someone else in the White House like</text>
  <text start="341.639" dur="9.2">Clinton we would be in a full-blown</text>
  <text start="346.939" dur="6.76">economic depression right now because</text>
  <text start="350.839" dur="6.67">she would have given the central bankers</text>
  <text start="353.699" dur="7.23">what they wanted so badly the event but</text>
  <text start="357.509" dur="5.94">since she didn&amp;#39;t win we&amp;#39;re not seeing</text>
  <text start="360.929" dur="4.95">that right now remember Trump he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="363.449" dur="4.92">preparing the economy for this</text>
  <text start="365.879" dur="5.07">transition he understands that this</text>
  <text start="368.369" dur="5.82">system can&amp;#39;t stay alive and this is why</text>
  <text start="370.949" dur="6.36">he&amp;#39;s reworking the trade deals redoing</text>
  <text start="374.189" dur="5.4">certain regulations and doing all this</text>
  <text start="377.309" dur="4.26">as quickly as he possibly can&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="379.589" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;ve taken many many years to get us</text>
  <text start="381.569" dur="5.28">to this place he has to undo all of this</text>
  <text start="383.849" dur="4.71">in a very short period of time but we</text>
  <text start="386.849" dur="4.23">are getting confirmation right now that</text>
  <text start="388.559" dur="4.23">the talk talks between the US and China</text>
  <text start="391.079" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;ll be taking place for the first</text>
  <text start="392.789" dur="5.43">time since the talks went south the last</text>
  <text start="396.269" dur="4.86">time they met and it looks like Robert</text>
  <text start="398.219" dur="5.22">light Heiser is ready and planning on</text>
  <text start="401.129" dur="4.29">calling his counterpart no he was not</text>
  <text start="403.439" dur="4.65">shipped off to a concentration camp</text>
  <text start="405.419" dur="7.28">piece he wasn&amp;#39;t killed or anything like</text>
  <text start="408.089" dur="8.01">that he&amp;#39;s still part of Xi Jinping&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="412.699" dur="6.07">unit and they will be talking to each</text>
  <text start="416.099" dur="8.52">other and they&amp;#39;re both going to speak</text>
  <text start="418.769" dur="8.63">before the g20 meeting and China has</text>
  <text start="424.619" dur="6.39">also confirmed this so they&amp;#39;re both on</text>
  <text start="427.399" dur="4.031">the same exact page right now now the</text>
  <text start="431.009" dur="4.831">federal</text>
  <text start="431.43" dur="7.23">Reserve they are doing exactly what they</text>
  <text start="435.84" dur="5.13">should be doing right now they are</text>
  <text start="438.66" dur="5.43">signaling that there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="440.97" dur="8.4">interest rate cuts beginning as early as</text>
  <text start="444.09" dur="8.06">July and they&amp;#39;re ready to battle growing</text>
  <text start="449.37" dur="5.73">global and domestic economic risks</text>
  <text start="452.15" dur="6.48">because what they&amp;#39;re seeing now is that</text>
  <text start="455.1" dur="7.02">the global economy is slowing and</text>
  <text start="458.63" dur="6.22">they&amp;#39;re building the narrative to make</text>
  <text start="462.12" dur="5.55">sure that everyone understands that they</text>
  <text start="464.85" dur="5.79">will need to do this so they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="467.67" dur="5.13">pricing it into the market and at this</text>
  <text start="470.64" dur="4.35">point it looks like it&amp;#39;s a complete done</text>
  <text start="472.8" dur="3.92">deal now we&amp;#39;re gonna take this a step</text>
  <text start="474.99" dur="3.66">further because once they cut rates</text>
  <text start="476.72" dur="5.49">guess what comes next</text>
  <text start="478.65" dur="7.23">that&amp;#39;s going to be stimulus and Trump is</text>
  <text start="482.21" dur="7.66">getting exactly what he needs</text>
  <text start="485.88" dur="6.12">are we all surprised no not really now</text>
  <text start="489.87" dur="4.86">very interestingly Charles Hughes Smith</text>
