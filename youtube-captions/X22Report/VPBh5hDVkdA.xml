  <text start="39.82" dur="6.09">dollar has just lost the reserve status</text>
  <text start="42.43" dur="6.99">and what we are seeing right now we are</text>
  <text start="45.91" dur="7.89">seeing that the Chinese are saying that</text>
  <text start="49.42" dur="6.87">they no longer need to purchase Treasury</text>

  <text start="56.29" dur="6.39">their money their US dollars in</text>
  <text start="59.01" dur="6.189">different ways and one way that we have</text>
  <text start="62.68" dur="4.729">seen and I reported on this is that they</text>
  <text start="65.199" dur="6.6">are using trillions of dollars now and</text>

  <text start="76.18" dur="6.93">help build an infrastructure in Africa</text>
  <text start="79.54" dur="7.95">and the Chinese right now are signaling</text>
  <text start="83.11" dur="8.579">to the entire world that the US dollar</text>
  <text start="87.49" dur="7.83">will no longer be the reserve currency</text>

  <text start="95.32" dur="6.15">don&amp;#39;t want it they don&amp;#39;t need it</text>
  <text start="98.2" dur="4.709">and we are seeing this happen right in</text>
  <text start="101.47" dur="4.649">front of our eyes</text>

  <text start="123.82" dur="7.79">this war that is coming and they need to</text>
  <text start="127.329" dur="7.89">do this because the dollar implosion is</text>
  <text start="131.61" dur="7.57">escalating right now foreign nations are</text>
  <text start="135.219" dur="6.421">going to be are going to dump the US</text>

  <text start="153.07" dur="6.6">time they are ready to dump what they</text>
  <text start="156.49" dur="7.53">have and this is why we have to remember</text>
  <text start="159.67" dur="7.5">the Fed has been out there telling</text>
  <text start="164.02" dur="6.15">everyone that they want to increase QE</text>

  <text start="202.54" dur="4.74">is all turning out and it&amp;#39;s pretty much</text>
  <text start="204.82" dur="5.91">what everyone has been talking about all</text>
  <text start="207.28" dur="6.179">along and we know that the economy is</text>
  <text start="210.73" dur="5.43">not doing well I know the stock market</text>
  <text start="213.459" dur="5.611">is going to new heights and you can see</text>
  <text start="216.16" dur="6.359">gold is being continually pushed down</text>
  <text start="219.07" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;re going to see gold push down as far</text>
  <text start="222.519" dur="3.841">as they can push it because what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="224.29" dur="4.79">trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying to get</text>
  <text start="226.36" dur="4.89">everyone out of gold right now and</text>
  <text start="229.08" dur="5.62">they&amp;#39;re trying to keep up the illusion</text>
  <text start="231.25" dur="6.39">that the economy is doing well markets</text>
  <text start="234.7" dur="3.8">going up gold is going down but guess</text>
  <text start="237.64" dur="3.69">what</text>
  <text start="238.5" dur="5.38">Goldman Sachs all these other financial</text>
  <text start="241.33" dur="6.05">institutions are they&amp;#39;re gobbling up the</text>
  <text start="243.88" dur="6.329">gold as it&amp;#39;s being sold they are</text>
  <text start="247.38" dur="5.32">completing everything that they put into</text>
  <text start="250.209" dur="6.15">motion at this time and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="252.7" dur="6.21">to do this all right now before this</text>
  <text start="256.359" dur="5.071">main event and we will probably see gold</text>
  <text start="258.91" dur="5.16">go even lower than it is right now and</text>
  <text start="261.43" dur="4.5">how do we know the economy is really not</text>
  <text start="264.07" dur="3.99">doing well well we take a look around</text>
  <text start="265.93" dur="3.78">the country see we see how retail sales</text>
  <text start="268.06" dur="3.75">are going because let&amp;#39;s put this into</text>
  <text start="269.71" dur="4.739">perspective they keep telling us that</text>
  <text start="271.81" dur="4.859">unemployment is</text>
  <text start="274.449" dur="4.891">getting better more people are getting</text>
  <text start="276.669" dur="6.06">jobs well if this is the case and this</text>
  <text start="279.34" dur="5.639">is so true then sales right now in the</text>
  <text start="282.729" dur="3.84">retail industry should be a lot better</text>
  <text start="284.979" dur="3.78">from a year ago right because the</text>
  <text start="286.569" dur="3.99">unemployment was what eight point three</text>
  <text start="288.759" dur="3.33">four percent and now it&amp;#39;s down to seven</text>
  <text start="290.559" dur="3.271">point three and now they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="292.089" dur="4.41">revise the unemployment or probably go</text>
  <text start="293.83" dur="4.229">to back down to seven point two so more</text>
  <text start="296.499" dur="4.53">people have jobs more people have</text>
  <text start="298.059" dur="5.25">disposable income and retail sales</text>
  <text start="301.029" dur="5.19">should be picking up but we see the</text>
  <text start="303.309" dur="5.07">opposite happening actually more people</text>
  <text start="306.219" dur="5.94">getting jobs they&amp;#39;re employed we should</text>
  <text start="308.379" dur="7.861">see housing going up from a year ago but</text>
  <text start="312.159" dur="7.07">what do we see we see it crumbling down</text>
  <text start="316.24" dur="8.87">we see everything declining right now</text>
  <text start="319.229" dur="9.851">Sears is hurting sales fell at both its</text>

  <text start="329.08" dur="6.269">discount chain and sales have dropped</text>
  <text start="332.11" dur="5.309">around six point seven percent and what</text>
  <text start="335.349" dur="4.831">they&amp;#39;re looking to do and we saw this</text>
  <text start="337.419" dur="5.011">happen to many other retailers they are</text>

  <text start="356.02" dur="5.069">every single time you see them closed a</text>
  <text start="358.569" dur="5.701">couple of stores guess what happens</text>
  <text start="361.089" dur="6.241">eventually it completely closes down and</text>
  <text start="364.27" dur="5.91">those stores that whole entire chain</text>

  <text start="379.12" dur="10.62">stores now like I said in the beginning</text>
  <text start="385.089" dur="7.92">of this report China no longer sees the</text>
  <text start="389.74" dur="5.94">benefit of holding the u.s. dollar and</text>

  <text start="411.79" dur="8.4">reserves they can use the US dollars in</text>
  <text start="415.38" dur="6.55">different diversified plans decreasing</text>
  <text start="420.19" dur="5.16">the influence of the dollar and other</text>
  <text start="421.93" dur="7.08">currencies is a step closer to reaching</text>
  <text start="425.35" dur="5.789">Chinese 2015 goal to float its currency</text>

  <text start="1875.63" dur="5.54">while the UN inspectors were there so we</text>
  <text start="1878.15" dur="9.96">can see what is happening at this point</text>
  <text start="1881.17" dur="10.81">so Saudi Arabia right now decided to use</text>
  <text start="1888.11" dur="6.27">the United Nations and what they did was</text>
  <text start="1891.98" dur="5.79">they decided to create a resolution on</text>

  <text start="1956.21" dur="6.69">committing and they were trying to</text>
  <text start="1958.31" dur="8.49">change the record at this time because</text>
  <text start="1962.9" dur="8.87">what do we know again CNN put out a</text>
