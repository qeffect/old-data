  <text start="70.82" dur="5.59">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="73.38" dur="4.44">political and geopolitical news now it</text>
  <text start="76.41" dur="3.03">looks like the deep state they are</text>
  <text start="77.82" dur="3.99">becoming very very desperate they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="79.44" dur="5.28">throwing everything out in the corporate</text>
  <text start="81.81" dur="4.26">media trying to bring down Trump and it</text>
  <text start="84.72" dur="3.149">really looks like they&amp;#39;re trying very</text>
  <text start="86.07" dur="3.659">hard I wouldn&amp;#39;t even be surprised if</text>
  <text start="87.869" dur="4.471">there&amp;#39;s another false flag out in Syria</text>
  <text start="89.729" dur="4.591">just to show that yes see Assad is still</text>

  <text start="111.54" dur="7.05">Russian bases well that most likely is</text>
  <text start="115.11" dur="5.34">an impeach an impeachable offense and I</text>
  <text start="118.59" dur="5.4">think this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="120.45" dur="9.3">but we see right now that Devon unas he</text>
  <text start="123.99" dur="7.56">is getting the unredacted memo that he</text>
  <text start="129.75" dur="3.51">originally wanted only certain</text>
  <text start="131.55" dur="3.42">individuals were able to see this and</text>
  <text start="133.26" dur="4.29">this is the whole thing that started the</text>
  <text start="134.97" dur="5.28">Russian collusion hoax and this is a</text>
  <text start="137.55" dur="6">two-page electronic communication that</text>
  <text start="140.25" dur="4.92">was supplied to the FISA Court and it</text>

  <text start="145.17" dur="3.48">redacted version that they got they</text>
  <text start="146.7" dur="5.07">couldn&amp;#39;t make heads or tails of it now</text>

  <text start="223.2" dur="3.3">sitting in front of Congress and we know</text>
  <text start="224.94" dur="3.33">a lot of Congress members receive</text>
  <text start="226.5" dur="4.59">donations for their campaign from</text>
  <text start="228.27" dur="5.46">Facebook so a lot of these congressmen</text>
  <text start="231.09" dur="6.57">congresswoman who are questioning</text>
  <text start="233.73" dur="7.65">Zuckerberg well they receive campaign</text>
  <text start="237.66" dur="4.17">contributions so I mean how far can this</text>
  <text start="241.38" dur="2.1">go</text>
  <text start="241.83" dur="5.16">Zuckerberg er is really not under oath</text>
  <text start="243.48" dur="8.7">either but what&amp;#39;s coming out of this it</text>
  <text start="246.99" dur="8.91">is showing the world that they take your</text>
  <text start="252.18" dur="6.809">data they censor and during the meeting</text>
  <text start="255.9" dur="5.04">with Zuckerberg and the government</text>
  <text start="258.989" dur="4.861">officials representative Marsha</text>
  <text start="260.94" dur="5.04">Blackburn a Zuckerberg do you</text>
  <text start="263.85" dur="4.8">subjectively manipulate your algorithms</text>
  <text start="265.98" dur="5.19">to prioritize or censor speech and</text>
  <text start="268.65" dur="5.25">Zuckerberg reply that he doesn&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="271.17" dur="5.52">what they are doing is censoring speech</text>
  <text start="273.9" dur="6.51">and that they do sensor types of content</text>
  <text start="276.69" dur="6.06">like terrorism Blackburn shot back let</text>
  <text start="280.41" dur="5.31">me tell you something right now diamond</text>
  <text start="282.75" dur="5.28">and silk is not terrorism diamond and</text>
  <text start="285.72" dur="4.14">silk are supporters of Trump who</text>
  <text start="288.03" dur="3.96">published their commentary on YouTube</text>

  <text start="291.99" dur="6.57">Facebook page has over 1.4 million likes</text>
  <text start="294.54" dur="6.42">and basically they were censored they</text>
  <text start="298.56" dur="4.98">were taken down now Zuckerberg said well</text>
  <text start="300.96" dur="5.61">that was an error and we brought that</text>
  <text start="303.54" dur="6.03">page back up and of course they keep</text>
  <text start="306.57" dur="5.4">saying all this is an error but it seems</text>
  <text start="309.57" dur="4.83">like YouTube does it Facebook does it</text>
  <text start="311.97" dur="4.83">Twitter does it and it&amp;#39;s getting a</text>
  <text start="314.4" dur="5.92">little tiring that these are all just</text>
  <text start="316.8" dur="6.19">errors that these pages are just coming</text>
  <text start="320.32" dur="5.64">down or the channels are just coming</text>
  <text start="322.99" dur="7.02">down and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="325.96" dur="6.87">that back on January 25th 2018 q posted</text>
  <text start="330.01" dur="6.39">number 605 about the internet Bill of</text>
  <text start="332.83" dur="5.58">Rights and this is all leading up to the</text>
  <text start="336.4" dur="3.63">Internet Bill of Rights because the</text>
  <text start="338.41" dur="4.74">White House came out and said listen</text>
  <text start="340.03" dur="6.03">this is coming from Sarah Sanders that</text>
  <text start="343.15" dur="5.76">everyone has the constitutional right to</text>
  <text start="346.06" dur="5.61">speak freely on prep platforms like</text>
  <text start="348.91" dur="6.18">social media sites they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="351.67" dur="5.7">starting the push for the internet Bill</text>
  <text start="355.09" dur="5.85">of Rights that is really where this is</text>
  <text start="357.37" dur="6.96">headed and in the background they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="360.94" dur="6.24">going to be dismantling the intelligence</text>
  <text start="364.33" dur="6.93">apparatus that is intertwined within</text>
  <text start="367.18" dur="6.84">this entire social media system which we</text>
  <text start="371.26" dur="8.43">discussed in previous reports we see the</text>
  <text start="374.02" dur="8.51">chemicals weapons watchdog the OPCW they</text>
  <text start="379.69" dur="6.21">came out and they said yes we confirm</text>
  <text start="382.53" dur="7.27">that the scribbles were poisoned with</text>
  <text start="385.9" dur="5.94">nova truck a nerve agent developed by</text>
  <text start="389.8" dur="5.64">the soviet union but as we know any</text>
  <text start="391.84" dur="6.81">country can develop this type of nerve</text>
  <text start="395.44" dur="6.38">gas and of course the UK was out there</text>
  <text start="398.65" dur="6.36">say we told you but there&amp;#39;s a problem</text>
  <text start="401.82" dur="6.49">they don&amp;#39;t know where it came from</text>
  <text start="405.01" dur="5.87">it&amp;#39;s almost like saying yes these two</text>
  <text start="408.31" dur="5.04">individuals were shot with an ak-47</text>
  <text start="410.88" dur="5.74">which means it was Russia but you know</text>
  <text start="413.35" dur="5.91">you can get an ak-47 anywhere so their</text>
  <text start="416.62" dur="4.61">argument is not working actually the</text>
  <text start="419.26" dur="6.36">u.s. the UK government scientist Gary</text>
  <text start="421.23" dur="8.5">Atkin head also said that yes Novacek</text>
  <text start="425.62" dur="6.57">was the poison but we don&amp;#39;t know where</text>
  <text start="429.73" dur="6">it came from did it come from</text>
  <text start="432.19" dur="7.08">CIA mi6 someplace else</text>
  <text start="435.73" dur="5.49">Russia we have no clue so again they</text>
  <text start="439.27" dur="4.68">have nothing they are stuck but of</text>
  <text start="441.22" dur="5.28">course the UK government officials are</text>
  <text start="443.95" dur="4.98">out there saying yes we got Russia no</text>
  <text start="446.5" dur="4.32">they don&amp;#39;t they don&amp;#39;t have anything it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="448.93" dur="3.6">almost like being on a murder trial</text>
  <text start="450.82" dur="3.379">saying yes this individuals were shot</text>
  <text start="452.53" dur="5.46">with a weapon</text>
  <text start="454.199" dur="7.09">okay but who had the weapon who shot the</text>
  <text start="457.99" dur="6.329">weapon what they&amp;#39;re saying is absolutely</text>
  <text start="461.289" dur="6.27">meaningless at this point we see the</text>
  <text start="464.319" dur="6.27">individuals in UK they&amp;#39;re saying listen</text>
  <text start="467.559" dur="5.25">and it&amp;#39;s all over social media we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="470.589" dur="4.491">want to go to war not in my name and</text>
  <text start="472.809" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re saying that we should not be</text>
  <text start="475.08" dur="6.25">involved in going to war actually they</text>
  <text start="478.569" dur="6.18">have a hashtag hashtag not in my name</text>
  <text start="481.33" dur="6.119">Theresa May and the people are saying</text>
  <text start="484.749" dur="4.98">listen we have money to go to war but we</text>
  <text start="487.449" dur="4.74">don&amp;#39;t have money for education police</text>
  <text start="489.729" dur="5.58">fire service the elderly the disabled</text>
  <text start="492.189" dur="7.551">and once again that is absolute truth</text>
  <text start="495.309" dur="6.48">now it looks like the UK has voted</text>
  <text start="499.74" dur="4.87">according to the statement from Downing</text>
  <text start="501.789" dur="5.67">Street saying that they agree on the</text>
  <text start="504.61" dur="5.13">need to take action to alleviate</text>
  <text start="507.459" dur="4.47">humanitarian distress entered to her and</text>
  <text start="509.74" dur="4.859">to deter the further use of chemical</text>
  <text start="511.929" dur="4.681">weapons by the Assad regime now they</text>
  <text start="514.599" dur="5.011">made this ruling without a wait what</text>
  <text start="516.61" dur="5.19">evidence of course they&amp;#39;re just out</text>
  <text start="519.61" dur="4.559">there saying that we need to go into</text>
  <text start="521.8" dur="4.469">Syria because remember the deep state</text>
  <text start="524.169" dur="4.141">this has been their plan from the</text>
  <text start="526.269" dur="4.711">beginning remember they don&amp;#39;t like to</text>
  <text start="528.31" dur="5.459">shy away from their goals and they are</text>
  <text start="530.98" dur="4.979">finding that now is the time because if</text>
  <text start="533.769" dur="5.101">we don&amp;#39;t go in guess what</text>
  <text start="535.959" dur="5.671">we lost Syria if we lose Syria we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="538.87" dur="6.24">get into a ramp and our whole entire</text>
  <text start="541.63" dur="6.329">system falls apart now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="545.11" dur="6.029">interesting about all this a BBC</text>
  <text start="547.959" dur="6.511">journalist he exposed the white helmet</text>
  <text start="551.139" dur="6.75">staging chemical attacks in Duma he</text>
  <text start="554.47" dur="6.9">tweeted the following that he was tired</text>
  <text start="557.889" dur="5.911">of these staged scenes and then he</text>
  <text start="561.37" dur="4.769">deleted his post but of course on the</text>
  <text start="563.8" dur="4.58">internet nothing is ever really deleted</text>
  <text start="566.139" dur="7.861">and were able to see his post and</text>
  <text start="568.38" dur="8.889">basically he was talking about the photo</text>
  <text start="574" dur="4.889">where individuals were hugging each</text>
  <text start="577.269" dur="4.081">other for the last embrace</text>
  <text start="578.889" dur="5.041">while they&amp;#39;re being poisoned and what</text>
  <text start="581.35" dur="4.109">they do is they continually you know set</text>
  <text start="583.93" dur="3.42">it all up they staged it they take</text>
  <text start="585.459" dur="6.151">photographs they put it out there and</text>
  <text start="587.35" dur="6.45">want everyone to feel that emotion of we</text>
  <text start="591.61" dur="5.22">must do something to stop this horrific</text>
  <text start="593.8" dur="4.77">crime now again these photographs this</text>
  <text start="596.83" dur="4.35">is the aftermath there&amp;#39;s no link it</text>
  <text start="598.57" dur="5.22">doesn&amp;#39;t say who did it how it was done</text>
  <text start="601.18" dur="5.43">they just want people to get full of</text>
  <text start="603.79" dur="5.19">emotion so they stop thinking so they</text>
  <text start="606.61" dur="5.49">just say yes let&amp;#39;s do this this is what</text>
  <text start="608.98" dur="6.75">nikki Haley does in the UN she just says</text>
  <text start="612.1" dur="5.55">you know horrific gas attack should they</text>
  <text start="615.73" dur="4.44">always bring up the children children</text>
  <text start="617.65" dur="4.95">they have died we must do something but</text>
  <text start="620.17" dur="4.47">she never shows the connection the proof</text>
  <text start="622.6" dur="3.99">the evidence they don&amp;#39;t want to show</text>
  <text start="624.64" dur="3.18">that because if they do guess what</text>
  <text start="626.59" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re in trouble</text>
  <text start="627.82" dur="4.62">because it will show that the terrorists</text>
  <text start="630.01" dur="4.77">or the rebels now think about this for a</text>
  <text start="632.44" dur="5.52">second there&amp;#39;s terrorists in the country</text>
  <text start="634.78" dur="4.53">if you notice nobody ever says hey you</text>

  <text start="639.31" dur="5.79">are terrorists you don&amp;#39;t think they you</text>
  <text start="642.46" dur="4.17">know pushed the gas attack now they</text>
  <text start="645.1" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;ll never go down that path because</text>

  <text start="712.9" dur="4.62">Douma which is a false flag and this is</text>
  <text start="715.45" dur="5.67">why you don&amp;#39;t see the evidence pouring</text>

  <text start="721.12" dur="7.11">the united states the deep state that is</text>
  <text start="724.269" dur="5.721">it and this is why russia sealed off the</text>
  <text start="728.23" dur="5.219">entire area</text>
  <text start="729.99" dur="7.99">now the syrian army they have arrested</text>

  <text start="747.55" dur="4.649">believed to be part of international</text>
  <text start="749.529" dur="5.81">military forces deployed in the region</text>

  <text start="768.67" dur="4.5">hold up signs saying you know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="770.709" dur="5.55">want to fight for al-qaeda but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="773.17" dur="6.859">being forced to do so and we see right</text>
  <text start="776.259" dur="7.95">now that the Syrian army has captured</text>
  <text start="780.029" dur="8.17">soldiers from Britain that were actually</text>
  <text start="784.209" dur="7.081">doing this so a lot of this evidence is</text>
  <text start="788.199" dur="5.041">coming out and we can see that the deep</text>
  <text start="791.29" dur="6.779">state they&amp;#39;re very nervous because as</text>
  <text start="793.24" dur="7.98">they lose their grip on Syria they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="798.069" dur="5.101">going to lose Syria now Russia is saying</text>

  <text start="807.79" dur="5.399">talking and I just want to go back to</text>
  <text start="810.069" dur="6.27">2013 for a second about the gas attack</text>
  <text start="813.189" dur="4.231">during that period when everything was</text>
  <text start="816.339" dur="3.66">all said and done of course they were</text>
  <text start="817.42" dur="5.13">blaming an on Assad they have the sarin</text>
  <text start="819.999" dur="4.89">gas they had the canister the missile</text>
  <text start="822.55" dur="8.25">that was used what everyone doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="824.889" dur="8.79">realize is that Carla del Ponte said the</text>
  <text start="830.8" dur="6.329">UN Commission investigating war crimes</text>
  <text start="833.679" dur="7.01">in Syria has strong concrete suspicions</text>
  <text start="837.129" dur="9.12">that rebels use chemical weapons and</text>
  <text start="840.689" dur="8.26">this was printed in the newspaper and it</text>
  <text start="846.249" dur="6.991">actually states that yes it was the</text>
  <text start="848.949" dur="6.031">rebels once again the rebels the Islamic</text>
  <text start="853.24" dur="4.89">state al Qaeda they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="854.98" dur="6.15">one in the same now Trump is out there</text>
  <text start="858.13" dur="6.149">and he&amp;#39;s saying he tweeted again that</text>
  <text start="861.13" dur="6.87">the bombing of Syria could take place or</text>
  <text start="864.279" dur="6.451">not so at all he didn&amp;#39;t say he was going</text>
  <text start="868" dur="4.769">to do it and we know that the US carrier</text>
  <text start="870.73" dur="4.26">Truman the strike group is headed</text>
  <text start="872.769" dur="3.331">towards Syria people are saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="874.99" dur="3.3">going to get there at the end of April</text>
  <text start="876.1" dur="3.39">maybe the beginning of May and you know</text>
  <text start="878.29" dur="4.109">it depends on how fast they&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="879.49" dur="4.83">but we see right now that there is no</text>
  <text start="882.399" dur="3.211">real evidence actually mattis&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="884.32" dur="5.16">there saying there&amp;#39;s no evidence on</text>
  <text start="885.61" dur="5.909">Syria on the Syria chemical attack they</text>
  <text start="889.48" dur="3.57">don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s Assad they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="891.519" dur="3.93">really have nothing right now and the</text>
  <text start="893.05" dur="5.31">only way to get that information is to</text>
  <text start="895.449" dur="5.161">have people on the ground collecting</text>
  <text start="898.36" dur="4.05">evidence right now they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="900.61" dur="4.05">the evidence they have is from social</text>
  <text start="902.41" dur="5.489">media that&amp;#39;s not how you collect</text>
  <text start="904.66" dur="4.56">evidence you go to the site and you do</text>
  <text start="907.899" dur="3.87">an investigation</text>
  <text start="909.22" dur="7.64">you take soil samples you talk to the</text>
  <text start="911.769" dur="9.63">people you take pictures you create a</text>
  <text start="916.86" dur="6.52">you know a storyline showing how</text>
  <text start="921.399" dur="5.37">something happened and you present the</text>
  <text start="923.38" dur="6.03">evidence on how it happened now again</text>
  <text start="926.769" dur="6.75">the deep state doesn&amp;#39;t want this to</text>
  <text start="929.41" dur="7.26">happen because if it was done it will</text>
  <text start="933.519" dur="5.31">show that it was staged this is why</text>
  <text start="936.67" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re pushing the attack and pushing</text>
  <text start="938.829" dur="6.481">very hard now I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if</text>
  <text start="941.44" dur="6.449">the deep state has another false flag</text>
  <text start="945.31" dur="4.32">another maybe chemical attack or</text>
  <text start="947.889" dur="3.271">something even bigger than that because</text>
  <text start="949.63" dur="4.699">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="951.16" dur="6.179">trying to push Trump into attacking now</text>
  <text start="954.329" dur="6.01">we know from yesterday when I discussed</text>
  <text start="957.339" dur="9.75">his strategy I don&amp;#39;t believe he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="960.339" dur="9.331">to be attacking the Syrian army Assad&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="967.089" dur="4.921">army or Russia that would be absolutely</text>
  <text start="969.67" dur="5.01">ridiculous because think about it in</text>
  <text start="972.01" dur="4.71">North Korea why didn&amp;#39;t he just go into</text>
  <text start="974.68" dur="6.06">North Korea start a war with Russia and</text>
  <text start="976.72" dur="8.57">China I mean why would he wait for Syria</text>
  <text start="980.74" dur="8.159">it makes no sense and again coming from</text>
  <text start="985.29" dur="8.62">q.q says POTUS never broke</text>
  <text start="988.899" dur="8.1">his moves Trump is a strategist he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="993.91" dur="5.94">businessman he knows how to play with</text>
  <text start="996.999" dur="5.161">other business individuals into getting</text>
  <text start="999.85" dur="4.409">them getting them to do things he wants</text>
  <text start="1002.16" dur="4.229">he&amp;#39;s doing the same thing with the</text>
  <text start="1004.259" dur="5.01">corporate media in the deep state he</text>
  <text start="1006.389" dur="6.781">acts irrational like a bumbling idiot on</text>
  <text start="1009.269" dur="6.48">purpose because again when looking like</text>
  <text start="1013.17" dur="4.68">a fool when looking like you don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1015.749" dur="5.041">what you&amp;#39;re doing when you&amp;#39;re when he</text>
  <text start="1017.85" dur="5.54">can&amp;#39;t make any decisions they think they</text>
  <text start="1020.79" dur="6.18">have the upper edge that&amp;#39;s his strategy</text>
  <text start="1023.39" dur="6.279">but in reality he&amp;#39;s playing with them</text>
  <text start="1026.97" dur="5.76">and in the background he&amp;#39;s planning</text>
  <text start="1029.669" dur="6.42">something completely different and they</text>
  <text start="1032.73" dur="4.859">think they have him they think oh wow</text>
  <text start="1036.089" dur="3.181">we&amp;#39;re gonna get him to fire these</text>
  <text start="1037.589" dur="4.62">missiles this is why you see on the</text>
  <text start="1039.27" dur="5.189">corporate media like CNN you know they</text>
  <text start="1042.209" dur="5.011">have 70 targets picked out or 20 targets</text>
  <text start="1044.459" dur="4.83">picked out he&amp;#39;s gonna be firing them in</text>
  <text start="1047.22" dur="4.25">24 to 48 hours once he makes the</text>
  <text start="1049.289" dur="5.071">decision and it&amp;#39;s gonna be a full</text>
  <text start="1051.47" dur="5.23">assault on Syria he&amp;#39;s gonna actually hit</text>
  <text start="1054.36" dur="3.78">Russia this is why he comes out and does</text>
  <text start="1056.7" dur="2.88">this this is why he wants the corporate</text>
  <text start="1058.14" dur="3.48">media to go along with this because</text>
  <text start="1059.58" dur="3.06">again they&amp;#39;re doing no research there</text>
  <text start="1061.62" dur="2.97">they&amp;#39;re not doing anything and just</text>
  <text start="1062.64" dur="5.159">listening to what he says and they think</text>
  <text start="1064.59" dur="5.25">that he&amp;#39;s going to do this and we could</text>
  <text start="1067.799" dur="4.291">see right now he&amp;#39;s planning something</text>
  <text start="1069.84" dur="4.41">completely different in the background</text>
  <text start="1072.09" dur="5.99">this is why q keeps saying enjoy the</text>
