  <text start="101.33" dur="4.59">collapse financial news now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="104.09" dur="5.22">talking about the central banks and how</text>
  <text start="105.92" dur="5.25">they are continually pushing and making</text>
  <text start="109.31" dur="4.38">it seem like cryptocurrencies in gold</text>
  <text start="111.17" dur="4.5">and silver that nobody should be looking</text>
  <text start="113.69" dur="4.86">at them whatsoever they&amp;#39;re used by</text>
  <text start="115.67" dur="4.589">criminals terrorists gold and silver the</text>
  <text start="118.55" dur="3.09">barbarous relics they&amp;#39;re absolutely</text>
  <text start="120.259" dur="2.731">meaningless the only thing that you</text>
  <text start="121.64" dur="4.53">should be concerned with is their fine</text>
  <text start="122.99" dur="5.519">at system where they have paper and ink</text>
  <text start="126.17" dur="4.1">and you should trade in that and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="128.509" dur="4.861">what you should use everything else is</text>
  <text start="130.27" dur="5.56">used by other criminals or it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="133.37" dur="5.82">barbarous and you shouldn&amp;#39;t use it</text>
  <text start="135.83" dur="5.28">anymore so we see right now why they are</text>
  <text start="139.19" dur="5.25">doing this and we already see from the</text>
  <text start="141.11" dur="6.3">Hong Kong report that the crypto market</text>
  <text start="144.44" dur="5.22">actually is not being used by terrorists</text>
  <text start="147.41" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s not being used by criminals to</text>
  <text start="149.66" dur="4.29">launder money it&amp;#39;s kind of ridiculous</text>
  <text start="151.76" dur="4.26">anyhow because everything is kept in the</text>
  <text start="153.95" dur="4.86">ledger and you can trace everything so</text>
  <text start="156.02" dur="4.17">why in the world would a criminal want</text>
  <text start="158.81" dur="3.39">to use something that you can trace it</text>
  <text start="160.19" dur="4.379">makes no sense but again most of the</text>
  <text start="162.2" dur="4.29">people out there just hear this and they</text>
  <text start="164.569" dur="4.381">believe what these central bankers are</text>
  <text start="166.49" dur="5.25">saying but what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="168.95" dur="7.74">that bitcoin is about to go physical and</text>
  <text start="171.74" dur="7.65">this is pretty darn different than what</text>
  <text start="176.69" dur="4.92">everyone has been thinking of and what I</text>
  <text start="179.39" dur="5.099">mean by this this startup company tan</text>
  <text start="181.61" dur="4.83">Djem this is a startup company in</text>
  <text start="184.489" dur="4.291">Switzerland and Singapore and has</text>
  <text start="186.44" dur="4.98">launched a pilot sale of physical notes</text>
  <text start="188.78" dur="6.12">of Bitcoin and this is called the smart</text>
  <text start="191.42" dur="5.43">banknotes and what it is it&amp;#39;s a car that</text>
  <text start="194.9" dur="4.44">has a chip which was developed by</text>
  <text start="196.85" dur="5.25">Samsung semiconductors it allows</text>
  <text start="199.34" dur="5.28">consumers to physically carry bitcoins</text>
  <text start="202.1" dur="6.45">stored in denominations of point zero</text>
  <text start="204.62" dur="6.54">one or about 96 dollars again this is</text>
  <text start="208.55" dur="5.31">going to fluctuate the first pilot batch</text>
  <text start="211.16" dur="4.77">consisting of 10,000 notes will be</text>
  <text start="213.86" dur="4.17">shipped from Singapore to petrol part to</text>
  <text start="215.93" dur="5.15">potential partners and distributors</text>
  <text start="218.03" dur="5.55">around the world now the idea behind</text>
  <text start="221.08" dur="4.72">creating physical notes of Bitcoin was</text>
  <text start="223.58" dur="4.95">in part to increase the ease of spending</text>
  <text start="225.8" dur="4.5">crypto improving the simplicity and</text>
  <text start="228.53" dur="4.29">security of acquiring owning and</text>
  <text start="230.3" dur="4.44">circulating cryptocurrency so basically</text>
  <text start="232.82" dur="4.28">it&amp;#39;s almost like an offline wallet which</text>
  <text start="234.74" dur="5.52">are carrying around with you so</text>
  <text start="237.1" dur="5.59">Singapore they developed a reputation as</text>
  <text start="240.26" dur="4.05">a hub for crypto currencies and</text>
  <text start="242.69" dur="4.65">blockchain development in Asia recently</text>
  <text start="244.31" dur="5.43">the Singapore FinTech Association and</text>
  <text start="247.34" dur="4.08">the FinTech Association of Japan signed</text>
  <text start="249.74" dur="3.87">a Memorandum of Understanding to</text>
  <text start="251.42" dur="4.28">collaborate on FinTech development</text>
  <text start="253.61" dur="4.439">additionally China and Singapore</text>
  <text start="255.7" dur="5.83">completed a shipment of gasoline</text>
  <text start="258.049" dur="8.691">entirely using blockchain technology in</text>
  <text start="261.53" dur="8.85">early April so we see right now that</text>
  <text start="266.74" dur="5.95">crypto currency is now making the next</text>
  <text start="270.38" dur="5.19">move and this is what the central</text>
  <text start="272.69" dur="6.24">bankers are kind of afraid of that the</text>
  <text start="275.57" dur="6.24">mainstream everyday person will start to</text>
  <text start="278.93" dur="7.05">catch on and start to realize wait a</text>
  <text start="281.81" dur="6.57">minute I can use crypto currencies I can</text>
  <text start="285.98" dur="4.05">use the blockchain I can carry this</text>
  <text start="288.38" dur="2.91">around see now it&amp;#39;s going to start to</text>
  <text start="290.03" dur="4.2">make sense to everyone</text>
  <text start="291.29" dur="5.58">and I can just go and just use this</text>
  <text start="294.23" dur="4.65">instead of using the bank currency</text>
  <text start="296.87" dur="4.95">instead of using the central bank</text>
  <text start="298.88" dur="6.93">finance system I don&amp;#39;t have to keep</text>
  <text start="301.82" dur="6.18">everything in the banking system so you</text>
  <text start="305.81" dur="3.63">can see right now that this is what</text>
  <text start="308" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re afraid of they&amp;#39;re afraid of it</text>
  <text start="309.44" dur="5.13">going mainstream now is this going to be</text>
  <text start="311.36" dur="6.3">the end be-all and end-all maybe maybe</text>
  <text start="314.57" dur="5.58">not but that doesn&amp;#39;t matter the idea is</text>
  <text start="317.66" dur="4.95">out there that people can</text>
  <text start="320.15" dur="5.04">use this and this is what the central</text>

  <text start="481.17" dur="5.14">people didn&amp;#39;t think that this was</text>
  <text start="483.1" dur="6.36">actually going to evolve and go into</text>
  <text start="486.31" dur="5.1">mainstream production but it has and now</text>
  <text start="489.46" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re looking to put place this on the</text>
  <text start="491.41" dur="4.56">blockchain and they want this because</text>
  <text start="494.35" dur="4.56">they want security and guess what else</text>
  <text start="495.97" dur="4.68">they want transparency remember once</text>
  <text start="498.91" dur="3.51">you&amp;#39;re on the blockchain it&amp;#39;s a ledger</text>
  <text start="500.65" dur="3.03">driven system you can see where</text>
  <text start="502.42" dur="3.18">everything is going</text>
  <text start="503.68" dur="4.35">and they said using blockchain</text>
  <text start="505.6" dur="4.74">technology in SPFs which is the</text>
  <text start="508.03" dur="5.129">financial communication transfer system</text>
  <text start="510.34" dur="5.55">would safeguard this system from hackers</text>
  <text start="513.159" dur="4.32">in the past Russia banks have</text>
  <text start="515.89" dur="4.2">experienced hacking related issues with</text>
  <text start="517.479" dur="4.521">using the Swift system and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="520.09" dur="5.46">saying if they put it on the blockchain</text>
  <text start="522" dur="6.1">guess what it&amp;#39;s less of a chance of</text>
  <text start="525.55" dur="5.1">getting hacked now once the exchanges</text>
  <text start="528.1" dur="4.55">become decentralized which is happening</text>
  <text start="530.65" dur="4.05">right now and the atop the atomic</text>
  <text start="532.65" dur="4.75">swapping where you can trade other</text>
  <text start="534.7" dur="5.1">bitcoins other cryptocurrencies for any</text>
  <text start="537.4" dur="4.53">other cryptocurrency guess what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="539.8" dur="4.2">going to make it very very difficult for</text>
  <text start="541.93" dur="4.05">hackers and this is coming down the line</text>
  <text start="544" dur="4.95">this is going to be you know the</text>
  <text start="545.98" dur="4.62">blockchain 2 point or 3.0 whatever it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="548.95" dur="3.57">going to be but we could see that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="550.6" dur="4.38">making huge developments and this is</text>
  <text start="552.52" dur="5.55">going to accelerate over time and we see</text>
  <text start="554.98" dur="5.19">this is why the private western central</text>
  <text start="558.07" dur="5.1">bank system this is what they&amp;#39;re so</text>
  <text start="560.17" dur="5.13">afraid of because if the people start to</text>
  <text start="563.17" dur="3.78">realize what this really is just like</text>
  <text start="565.3" dur="5.55">the alternative media and everything</text>
  <text start="566.95" dur="7.139">else with YouTube and social media the</text>
  <text start="570.85" dur="5.1">alternative media was born out of the</text>
  <text start="574.089" dur="4.651">internet because it allowed people to</text>
  <text start="575.95" dur="4.77">communicate and to express what was</text>
  <text start="578.74" dur="3.72">going on instead of looking at the</text>
  <text start="580.72" dur="3.72">corporate media so people found other</text>
  <text start="582.46" dur="3.09">outlets and people started to realize</text>
  <text start="584.44" dur="2.4">well wait a minute there&amp;#39;s other</text>
  <text start="585.55" dur="3.12">information about the Corp</text>
  <text start="586.84" dur="3.72">telling us and the establishment well</text>
  <text start="588.67" dur="3.15">they didn&amp;#39;t like this this is why</text>
  <text start="590.56" dur="4.469">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to shut it down</text>
  <text start="591.82" dur="4.47">right now see how this works this is</text>
  <text start="595.029" dur="3.301">what they were so afraid of all they</text>
  <text start="596.29" dur="3.75">didn&amp;#39;t realize really what it was they</text>
  <text start="598.33" dur="3.06">came into the game very late and then</text>
  <text start="600.04" dur="3.03">they started to realize what it was they</text>
  <text start="601.39" dur="3.6">took over the system where the</text>
  <text start="603.07" dur="4.97">intelligent agencies went ahead and they</text>
  <text start="604.99" dur="6.12">you know basically got their hands into</text>
  <text start="608.04" dur="5.14">Facebook into YouTube into Google and</text>
  <text start="611.11" dur="4.02">things like that now they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="613.18" dur="3.57">cut this off in the very beginning with</text>
  <text start="615.13" dur="4.95">cryptocurrency so this is where we are</text>
  <text start="616.75" dur="7.47">right now now it looks like the day of</text>
  <text start="620.08" dur="6.6">reckoning is coming for the entire</text>
  <text start="624.22" dur="3.9">economic system and a while back I did</text>
  <text start="626.68" dur="3.15">an interview with Bill halter on the</text>
  <text start="628.12" dur="4.08">x-22 Report spotlight where we talked</text>
  <text start="629.83" dur="4.86">about how the credit system is going to</text>
  <text start="632.2" dur="4.29">basically break down and freeze and it</text>
  <text start="634.69" dur="3">looks like corporate borrowers well they</text>

  <text start="637.69" dur="1.95">reckoning and it&amp;#39;s coming very very</text>
  <text start="638.86" dur="3.18">quickly</text>
  <text start="639.64" dur="5.28">looks like the credit reckoning may be</text>
  <text start="642.04" dur="4.83">very near balance sheets have become</text>
  <text start="644.92" dur="4.29">more and more bloated from the excess</text>
  <text start="646.87" dur="5.06">borrowing which was created by the</text>

  <text start="651.93" dur="4.24">shrinking baño premiums don&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="654.55" dur="4.95">at some point they argue that they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="656.17" dur="6.75">have to be a reckoning now could this be</text>
  <text start="659.5" dur="5.7">nearing that point I think so because</text>
  <text start="662.92" dur="4.05">one place you can see them in the latest</text>
  <text start="665.2" dur="4.62">monthly survey put out by the National</text>

  <text start="706.15" dur="5.79">putting it at its lowest level since</text>
  <text start="708.42" dur="7.48">2009 the height of the financial crisis</text>
  <text start="711.94" dur="6.899">now the folks at the NA cm aren&amp;#39;t quite</text>
  <text start="715.9" dur="4.71">sure what to make of this big plunge but</text>
  <text start="718.839" dur="4.411">what they do know</text>
  <text start="720.61" dur="7.169">is that credit conditions are getting</text>
  <text start="723.25" dur="6.54">weaker and the strengthen economy has</text>
  <text start="727.779" dur="4.261">forced more companies to boost</text>
  <text start="729.79" dur="4.44">borrowings to keep pace with their</text>
  <text start="732.04" dur="4.289">competitors now they may be struggling</text>
  <text start="734.23" dur="5.07">to keep on top of that debt because</text>
  <text start="736.329" dur="5.611">rising interest rates they&amp;#39;re adding a</text>
  <text start="739.3" dur="5.25">lot of pressure on corporations with</text>
  <text start="741.94" dur="5.01">large refinancing needs and it looks</text>
  <text start="744.55" dur="4.02">like things are starting to really break</text>
  <text start="746.95" dur="3.3">down now and if the interest rates</text>
  <text start="748.57" dur="3.449">continually move up guess what happens</text>
  <text start="750.25" dur="5.399">things break down further we saw this</text>
  <text start="752.019" dur="7.471">prior to 2008 we saw the credit markets</text>
  <text start="755.649" dur="6.721">completely freeze up in 2007 going into</text>
  <text start="759.49" dur="4.98">2008 especially 2009 the signs were all</text>
  <text start="762.37" dur="4.44">around us and we&amp;#39;re seeing the same</text>
  <text start="764.47" dur="4.47">thing happened once again so it looks</text>
  <text start="766.81" dur="4.35">like the day of reckoning it&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="768.94" dur="4.38">very very quickly and this is why the</text>
  <text start="771.16" dur="4.919">Trump and the Patriots and the central</text>
  <text start="773.32" dur="4.199">bank&amp;#39;s they are battling it out who is</text>
  <text start="776.079" dur="4.351">going to control the narrative when this</text>
  <text start="777.519" dur="4.861">entire system comes down this is what</text>
  <text start="780.43" dur="4.08">this fight is all about because we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="782.38" dur="5.22">a central banking system it can&amp;#39;t last</text>
  <text start="784.51" dur="5.699">forever we know this from history where</text>
  <text start="787.6" dur="4.38">it only lasts about 4045 years they kept</text>
  <text start="790.209" dur="5.091">it going for a very long time because</text>
  <text start="791.98" dur="6.599">they were allowed to create funny money</text>
  <text start="795.3" dur="5.469">propping up the banks the public didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="798.579" dur="4.051">see this they were able to push bubbles</text>
  <text start="800.769" dur="3.201">higher and higher but you know what</text>
  <text start="802.63" dur="3.389">happens every time this happens</text>
  <text start="803.97" dur="4.63">everything comes crashing down we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="806.019" dur="4.44">seen in the past this is nothing new and</text>
  <text start="808.6" dur="4.049">we&amp;#39;re seeing it once again and</text>
  <text start="810.459" dur="3.421">everyone&amp;#39;s gonna look back and go oh my</text>
  <text start="812.649" dur="3.421">god the signs were all over the place</text>
  <text start="813.88" dur="3.48">look real estate was a bubble this is</text>
  <text start="816.07" dur="2.879">what they always do real estate was a</text>
  <text start="817.36" dur="2.76">bubble look at the the automobile</text>
  <text start="818.949" dur="3.061">industry you know what happened there</text>
  <text start="820.12" dur="2.88">they let all the subprime people in you</text>
  <text start="822.01" dur="2.97">know what happened the real estate at</text>
  <text start="823" dur="3.72">the end stage they let all the subprime</text>
  <text start="824.98" dur="3.96">people in they didn&amp;#39;t do any income</text>
  <text start="826.72" dur="3.54">checks this can&amp;#39;t be this can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="828.94" dur="2.79">allowed to happen once again this is</text>
  <text start="830.26" dur="3.63">what they always do they always go back</text>
  <text start="831.73" dur="4.43">in time and tell you what happened well</text>
  <text start="833.89" dur="5.37">right now we&amp;#39;re all discussing it now</text>
  <text start="836.16" dur="6.4">what is happening because we know</text>
  <text start="839.26" dur="5.25">eventually the powers that be are gonna</text>
  <text start="842.56" dur="4.769">say yeah the whole thing is just</text>
  <text start="844.51" dur="6.15">breaking down and here we are once again</text>
  <text start="847.329" dur="5.641">at the end now Venezuela I mean we need</text>
  <text start="850.66" dur="3.72">to look at Venezuela because this is</text>
  <text start="852.97" dur="3.78">showing us what</text>
  <text start="854.38" dur="4.46">happen maybe not to the extreme but</text>
  <text start="856.75" dur="5.1">something very close because right now</text>
  <text start="858.84" dur="6.43">when you look at Venezuela they are</text>
  <text start="861.85" dur="6.45">bordering a haircut right now costs five</text>
  <text start="865.27" dur="5.25">bananas and two eggs they are bartering</text>
  <text start="868.3" dur="4.17">remember we talked about this while ago</text>
  <text start="870.52" dur="3.27">where we said eventually you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="872.47" dur="5.31">need cash on hand that&amp;#39;s why to keep</text>
  <text start="873.79" dur="5.22">cash in your home someplace close</text>
  <text start="877.78" dur="3.75">someplace safe</text>
  <text start="879.01" dur="4.05">where you can get to it because in the</text>
  <text start="881.53" dur="4.02">beginning stages everyone knows about</text>
  <text start="883.06" dur="5.46">cash and they&amp;#39;ll use cash and when</text>
  <text start="885.55" dur="4.62">inflation hits the value of that cash is</text>
  <text start="888.52" dur="2.88">going to decrease very very rapidly so</text>
  <text start="890.17" dur="3.42">you&amp;#39;re gonna have you want to get rid of</text>
  <text start="891.4" dur="4.14">it very quickly and get whatever you</text>
  <text start="893.59" dur="3.3">could possibly can then eventually</text>
  <text start="895.54" dur="2.88">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is that no one</text>
  <text start="896.89" dur="3.99">will accept cash because it&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="898.42" dur="4.71">absolutely worthless will then move into</text>
  <text start="900.88" dur="5.07">bartering and people will say okay you</text>
  <text start="903.13" dur="5.01">know what I&amp;#39;ll give you a 5 bananas 2</text>
  <text start="905.95" dur="4.23">eggs for a haircut and this is what</text>
  <text start="908.14" dur="4.14">people will do like oh you want food</text>
  <text start="910.18" dur="4.02">I&amp;#39;ll take toilet paper and people will</text>
  <text start="912.28" dur="4.14">start to barter then eventually what</text>
  <text start="914.2" dur="3.93">will happen is a new system will come</text>
  <text start="916.42" dur="4.86">online maybe it&amp;#39;ll be a cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="918.13" dur="5.01">system and those people who have crypto</text>
  <text start="921.28" dur="4.56">currencies that will be revaluated much</text>
  <text start="923.14" dur="4.59">much higher and people will then use</text>
  <text start="925.84" dur="3.54">those or trade them into another</text>
  <text start="927.73" dur="3.93">cryptocurrency which everyone agrees</text>
  <text start="929.38" dur="3.39">upon to use or everyone will be able to</text>
  <text start="931.66" dur="3.63">use whatever they want and they&amp;#39;ll use</text>
  <text start="932.77" dur="5.4">atomic swaps to actually make the</text>
  <text start="935.29" dur="5.55">transactions and people who have gold</text>
  <text start="938.17" dur="4.47">and silver that will ensure their wealth</text>
  <text start="940.84" dur="3.9">because as the dollar devalues and</text>
  <text start="942.64" dur="2.64">crashes guess what happens the gold and</text>
  <text start="944.74" dur="2.46">silver</text>
  <text start="945.28" dur="4.2">yes throughout history the same thing</text>
  <text start="947.2" dur="4.41">happens it goes up so you have that</text>
  <text start="949.48" dur="4.89">insurance policy you can then trade it</text>
  <text start="951.61" dur="6.72">in for what cryptocurrency to use as</text>
  <text start="954.37" dur="6.09">trade and you are then set and of course</text>
  <text start="958.33" dur="3.9">you need your supplies like water food</text>
  <text start="960.46" dur="4.83">and things like that so you can barter</text>
  <text start="962.23" dur="5.52">so again this might not happen the way</text>
  <text start="965.29" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s happening in Venezuela but again</text>
  <text start="967.75" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;re gonna get pretty darn close to</text>
  <text start="969.88" dur="3.81">what is happening there and people are</text>
  <text start="972.04" dur="3.36">gonna be shocked surprised they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="973.69" dur="5.37">gonna know what is happening because</text>
  <text start="975.4" dur="5.07">again the central banks the manipulation</text>
  <text start="979.06" dur="2.76">of all these stats that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="980.47" dur="3.21">throwing out there the corporate media</text>
  <text start="981.82" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s all going to be turning out to be</text>
  <text start="983.68" dur="3.66">one gigantic illusionary lie that</text>
  <text start="986.32" dur="2.7">they&amp;#39;ve been key</text>
  <text start="987.34" dur="3.72">in all this time and then people are</text>
  <text start="989.02" dur="3.96">gonna start to realize whoa what just</text>
  <text start="991.06" dur="4.59">happened and this is this brings us back</text>
  <text start="992.98" dur="4.83">to the narrative part where whoever</text>
  <text start="995.65" dur="4.17">controls the narrative will be able to</text>
  <text start="997.81" dur="4.38">tell the story of what really happened</text>
  <text start="999.82" dur="3.75">and I always refer back to 1971 when</text>
  <text start="1002.19" dur="2.43">we&amp;#39;re coming off the gold standard going</text>
  <text start="1003.57" dur="3.09">on to the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="1004.62" dur="3.24">where the central bank&amp;#39;s back then had</text>
  <text start="1006.66" dur="4.23">the narrative they told us there was a</text>
  <text start="1007.86" dur="4.71">gas shortage that speculators are</text>
  <text start="1010.89" dur="2.97">dabbling in gold actually the countries</text>
  <text start="1012.57" dur="2.79">wanted their gold back because they saw</text>
  <text start="1013.86" dur="2.97">what the United States was doing they</text>
  <text start="1015.36" dur="3.419">were creating a lot more currency than</text>
  <text start="1016.83" dur="3.33">there was gold and other countries</text>
  <text start="1018.779" dur="3.571">started to realize this and of course</text>
  <text start="1020.16" dur="3.78">what did the United States the central</text>
  <text start="1022.35" dur="3.87">bankers have to do they had to stop</text>
  <text start="1023.94" dur="3.629">those individuals those countries from</text>
  <text start="1026.22" dur="2.64">coming in and taking their gold and this</text>
  <text start="1027.569" dur="3.89">is why they had to make up the story so</text>
  <text start="1028.86" dur="5.03">they created these narratives to</text>
  <text start="1031.459" dur="5.38">convince you of why this is happening</text>
  <text start="1033.89" dur="4.48">today the central bank would like to</text>
  <text start="1036.839" dur="2.49">have that narrative once again so they</text>
  <text start="1038.37" dur="3.27">can explain</text>
  <text start="1039.329" dur="4.38">why we need to go on to a new system</text>
  <text start="1041.64" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;ll make it out that these countries</text>
  <text start="1043.709" dur="3.781">or these groups have been dabbling in</text>
  <text start="1045.63" dur="3.87">something and destroying the dollar and</text>
  <text start="1047.49" dur="4.05">this is why we need to move to maybe the</text>
  <text start="1049.5" dur="2.76">SDR that they have planned for us or</text>
  <text start="1051.54" dur="2.85">things like that</text>
  <text start="1052.26" dur="4.56">or we have Trump in the Patriots saying</text>
  <text start="1054.39" dur="4.47">it was the central bank&amp;#39;s fault they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1056.82" dur="3.39">the ones who created this we need to</text>
  <text start="1058.86" dur="2.76">audit them we need to find out what</text>
  <text start="1060.21" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;ve been doing over a period of time</text>
  <text start="1061.62" dur="3.99">because we don&amp;#39;t believe the central</text>
  <text start="1063.3" dur="5.22">bank should exist at this point because</text>
  <text start="1065.61" dur="4.89">we need a full investigation because if</text>
  <text start="1068.52" dur="4.74">we go back to 2008 and going back in</text>
  <text start="1070.5" dur="4.5">time we&amp;#39;re starting to see patterns with</text>
  <text start="1073.26" dur="3.81">the central bank and let&amp;#39;s just take a</text>
  <text start="1075" dur="4.02">look because I think the people of the</text>
  <text start="1077.07" dur="4.62">country people around the world they</text>
  <text start="1079.02" dur="5.46">have the right to see what the central</text>
  <text start="1081.69" dur="6.15">banks are doing because again they are</text>
  <text start="1084.48" dur="5.01">working for the people right or are they</text>
  <text start="1087.84" dur="3.45">working for themselves but we need to</text>
  <text start="1089.49" dur="3.27">find out because we know the central</text>
  <text start="1091.29" dur="2.73">banks they&amp;#39;re private and they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="1092.76" dur="2.34">working for themselves but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1094.02" dur="3.3">supposed to be working for the people</text>
  <text start="1095.1" dur="4.829">but if they are working for the people</text>
  <text start="1097.32" dur="5.43">like they say they are then we have the</text>
  <text start="1099.929" dur="6.121">right to see what they are doing because</text>
  <text start="1102.75" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re running a people&amp;#39;s economy so</text>
  <text start="1106.05" dur="5.82">they say and we should have the right to</text>
  <text start="1108.3" dur="5.34">audit them to see where all of our funds</text>
  <text start="1111.87" dur="4.05">are going but again they&amp;#39;re gonna say</text>
  <text start="1113.64" dur="4.95">these are our funds we&amp;#39;re letting you</text>
  <text start="1115.92" dur="4.57">use it it&amp;#39;s a Federal Reserve Note which</text>
  <text start="1118.59" dur="4.54">is a debt instrument</text>
  <text start="1120.49" dur="6.18">and if they do go down this path there</text>
  <text start="1123.13" dur="6.9">is no reason to have this establishment</text>
  <text start="1126.67" dur="6.24">whatsoever because they just have proven</text>
  <text start="1130.03" dur="3.84">to everyone that first of all you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1132.91" dur="3.42">allowed to look</text>
  <text start="1133.87" dur="4.11">second of all it&amp;#39;s their currency third</text>
  <text start="1136.33" dur="3.45">of all you&amp;#39;re not working for the people</text>
  <text start="1137.98" dur="4.29">so at that point</text>
  <text start="1139.78" dur="2.91">forget the audit let&amp;#39;s just get rid of</text>
  <text start="1142.27" dur="3.03">them</text>
  <text start="1142.69" dur="4.68">repay what we owe the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="1145.3" dur="4.89">for starting up which is not that much</text>
  <text start="1147.37" dur="6.809">money in today&amp;#39;s standards pay it off</text>
  <text start="1150.19" dur="6.48">and be done with them and I think this</text>
  <text start="1154.179" dur="5.281">is the approach that we need to take as</text>
