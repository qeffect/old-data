  <text start="82.13" dur="4.71">establishments and they try to show</text>
  <text start="84.979" dur="4.741">what&amp;#39;s really going on it looks like</text>
  <text start="86.84" dur="5.13">O&amp;#39;Keefe well he strikes again he went to</text>
  <text start="89.72" dur="5.34">the New York Times spoke to New York</text>
  <text start="91.97" dur="6.81">Times editors on hidden camera and they</text>
  <text start="95.06" dur="7.29">told him quite a bit and basically he</text>
  <text start="98.78" dur="6.42">spoke to this individual dudich and he</text>
  <text start="102.35" dur="4.23">said that you know he is very important</text>
  <text start="105.2" dur="4.62">in New York Times</text>
  <text start="106.58" dur="4.71">he&amp;#39;s the strategy editor he admits</text>
  <text start="109.82" dur="3">repeatedly promoting content that</text>
  <text start="111.29" dur="4.469">intentionally seeks to among other</text>
  <text start="112.82" dur="4.53">things damage Trump and here we are once</text>
  <text start="115.759" dur="4.021">again looking at the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="117.35" dur="4.799">now in the York the New York Times came</text>
  <text start="119.78" dur="5.82">out and they said no this is just a</text>
  <text start="122.149" dur="5.941">low-level jr. position employee he</text>
  <text start="125.6" dur="4.439">misrepresented his role he has nothing</text>
  <text start="128.09" dur="5.67">to do with this but we&amp;#39;ve also learned</text>
  <text start="130.039" dur="7.861">that this individual also worked on the</text>
  <text start="133.76" dur="6.24">Clinton campaign in 2016 and we see</text>
  <text start="137.9" dur="4.35">right now that New York Times they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="140" dur="4.65">trying to explain away why this</text>
  <text start="142.25" dur="3.78">individual said this what is going on</text>
  <text start="144.65" dur="3.54">and they&amp;#39;re saying that this person is</text>
  <text start="146.03" dur="4.77">really of no interest whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="148.19" dur="6.6">most likely he will be fired from his</text>
  <text start="150.8" dur="5.79">position now the Spanish government they</text>
  <text start="154.79" dur="5.49">are going to be beginning their process</text>
  <text start="156.59" dur="5.22">to suspend Catalan autonomy we can see</text>
  <text start="160.28" dur="4.17">right now that the spanish prime</text>
  <text start="161.81" dur="4.259">minister formally demanded the catalan</text>
  <text start="164.45" dur="3.45">leader clarify whether independence has</text>
  <text start="166.069" dur="3.901">been declared saying that it is needed</text>
  <text start="167.9" dur="4.14">before he can decide what steps to take</text>
  <text start="169.97" dur="4.379">remember they also have article one four</text>
  <text start="172.04" dur="4.38">five five of the constitution which is a</text>
  <text start="174.349" dur="4.411">nuclear option where they just go right</text>
  <text start="176.42" dur="4.67">into catalan and they pretty much seize</text>
  <text start="178.76" dur="5.58">everything and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="181.09" dur="6.26">spain is giving catalonia five day</text>
  <text start="184.34" dur="5.65">ultimatum to clarify if it declare</text>
  <text start="187.35" dur="5.22">independence now again the people voted</text>
  <text start="189.99" dur="5.4">they said yes we want independence and</text>
  <text start="192.57" dur="5.19">we see right now that you know something</text>
  <text start="195.39" dur="3.75">is definitely brewing we can see that</text>
  <text start="197.76" dur="2.94">people are going to be getting upset if</text>
  <text start="199.14" dur="3.69">they don&amp;#39;t move forward with</text>
  <text start="200.7" dur="4.05">independence and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="202.83" dur="5.31">watch a situation very closely now out</text>
  <text start="204.75" dur="5.82">in North Korea we can see words are</text>
  <text start="208.14" dur="5.1">going back and forth Trump is speaking</text>
  <text start="210.57" dur="4.35">North Korea speaking and of course</text>
  <text start="213.24" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re telling each other how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="214.92" dur="4.86">going to wipe each other out and we see</text>
  <text start="217.98" dur="4.83">the United States flew to be one be</text>
  <text start="219.78" dur="5.61">strategic bombers around South Korea</text>
  <text start="222.81" dur="4.38">during these drills and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="225.39" dur="2.76">interesting about all this and we talked</text>
  <text start="227.19" dur="4.74">about this before</text>
  <text start="228.15" dur="6.69">the Cabal they are backed against the</text>
  <text start="231.93" dur="5.96">wall right now and we know they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="234.84" dur="5.22">have many options left in Syria</text>
  <text start="237.89" dur="3.73">everything is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="240.06" dur="3.45">for them they&amp;#39;re being called out on</text>
  <text start="241.62" dur="4.71">everything where they&amp;#39;ve been supporting</text>
  <text start="243.51" dur="6.33">the Islamic state the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="246.33" dur="6.42">losing ground we see that other factions</text>
  <text start="249.84" dur="6.209">like Al Qaeda the Free Syrian Army the</text>
  <text start="252.75" dur="6.03">Kurds everything is not going their way</text>
  <text start="256.049" dur="4.081">in this area and they understand that</text>
  <text start="258.78" dur="4.08">other countries throughout the Middle</text>
  <text start="260.13" dur="4.71">East it is all falling apart I mean the</text>
  <text start="262.86" dur="3.96">Middle East is falling right now and the</text>
  <text start="264.84" dur="5.66">Cabal can&amp;#39;t really do that much about it</text>
  <text start="266.82" dur="7.59">and we know they have some type of</text>
  <text start="270.5" dur="5.5">nuclear option a nuclear event and I</text>
  <text start="274.41" dur="4.59">don&amp;#39;t mean a nuclear war I&amp;#39;m just saying</text>
  <text start="276" dur="6.66">their last-ditch effort to do something</text>
  <text start="279" dur="6.21">and we mentioned in many many reports</text>
  <text start="282.66" dur="4.8">about a cyber attack on the financial</text>
  <text start="285.21" dur="4.62">institutions and what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="287.46" dur="6.9">is they&amp;#39;re already starting the</text>
  <text start="289.83" dur="7.41">propaganda about North Korea and how</text>
  <text start="294.36" dur="6.36">they might be hitting the power grid</text>
  <text start="297.24" dur="7.47">system now this is coming out of the New</text>
  <text start="300.72" dur="7.29">York Daily News and NBC they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="304.71" dur="6.38">there saying that North Korea has</text>
  <text start="308.01" dur="6.81">targeted American power companies for</text>
  <text start="311.09" dur="6.04">cyberattack hackers linked to Kim Jong</text>
  <text start="314.82" dur="4.65">Un&amp;#39;s regime would target people with</text>
  <text start="317.13" dur="4.02">spear phishing emails that trick</text>
  <text start="319.47" dur="3.84">recipients into downloading</text>
  <text start="321.15" dur="3.96">malware and this is coming from a</text>
  <text start="323.31" dur="3.87">company called fire I saying that</text>
  <text start="325.11" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re prepared and ready to do this</text>
  <text start="327.18" dur="5.52">now there&amp;#39;s no evidence the hackers are</text>
  <text start="330.42" dur="4.8">going to be successful in this there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="332.7" dur="6.51">mess we&amp;#39;ve spotted some of these emails</text>
  <text start="335.22" dur="6.24">and this is all propaganda building up</text>
  <text start="339.21" dur="3.9">to the lights-out event that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="341.46" dur="3.93">call it I call the lights out of it and</text>
  <text start="343.11" dur="4.47">I don&amp;#39;t mean the whole country is gonna</text>
  <text start="345.39" dur="3.9">go dark they&amp;#39;re gonna do it in very</text>
  <text start="347.58" dur="4.53">specific areas almost like the East</text>
  <text start="349.29" dur="4.86">Coast back in 2003 where all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="352.11" dur="4.05">the power went out and the East Coast</text>
  <text start="354.15" dur="4.38">had no power I do believe I was in</text>
  <text start="356.16" dur="4.23">Manhattan at that time and I believe</text>
  <text start="358.53" dur="3.69">this was a test because what they</text>
  <text start="360.39" dur="3.45">normally do is they test things way</text>
  <text start="362.22" dur="3.6">ahead of time now in the beginning of</text>
  <text start="363.84" dur="3.42">the power outage everyone was in a very</text>
  <text start="365.82" dur="3.15">good mood I mean restaurants were</text>
  <text start="367.26" dur="3.9">selling food they had to get rid of</text>
  <text start="368.97" dur="4.26">whatever they had because it would melt</text>
  <text start="371.16" dur="3.99">the refrigeration wasn&amp;#39;t working they</text>
  <text start="373.23" dur="3.9">were selling beer for a dollar people</text>
  <text start="375.15" dur="4.08">were generally in generally in a good</text>
  <text start="377.13" dur="3.75">mood air-conditioning and buildings were</text>
  <text start="379.23" dur="4.35">completely shut off and I note notice</text>
  <text start="380.88" dur="4.59">one thing very important here is that</text>
  <text start="383.58" dur="4.35">most of these buildings had generators</text>
  <text start="385.47" dur="5.25">but the problem was they couldn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="387.93" dur="5.04">fuel into the buildings to keep the</text>
  <text start="390.72" dur="4.74">generators operational so after about</text>
  <text start="392.97" dur="4.92">3-4 hours most of the building started</text>
  <text start="395.46" dur="6.33">to cut out and they couldn&amp;#39;t get any</text>
  <text start="397.89" dur="6.39">fuel trucks into Manhattan to refuel all</text>
  <text start="401.79" dur="4.29">these generators so if we have some type</text>
  <text start="404.28" dur="3.84">of power outage let&amp;#39;s say they do</text>
  <text start="406.08" dur="4.5">something in New York they do something</text>
  <text start="408.12" dur="4.23">in LA maybe something in Texas maybe</text>
  <text start="410.58" dur="5.04">something in Boston in many different</text>
  <text start="412.35" dur="6.09">areas to show that over there the North</text>
  <text start="415.62" dur="5.37">Korea is hitting many areas in these</text>
  <text start="418.44" dur="4.71">cities there&amp;#39;s going to be a major</text>
  <text start="420.99" dur="3.81">problem because they&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="423.15" dur="4.17">able to get supplies into these areas</text>
  <text start="424.8" dur="4.95">and it might be many many days before</text>
  <text start="427.32" dur="4.77">they get anything in there and we can</text>
  <text start="429.75" dur="4.68">see right now they are begin there at</text>
  <text start="432.09" dur="4.98">the beginning of stages of trying to</text>
  <text start="434.43" dur="6.54">convince everyone that North Korea has</text>
  <text start="437.07" dur="7.83">the capability of doing this now they</text>
  <text start="440.97" dur="5.7">also refer to how North Korea hit Sony</text>
  <text start="444.9" dur="3.63">Pictures and they cyberattack Sony</text>
  <text start="446.67" dur="3.48">Pictures and of course we know that</text>
  <text start="448.53" dur="4.02">story is completely fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="450.15" dur="4.2">we know this was an inside job it was a</text>
  <text start="452.55" dur="4.11">disgruntled worker and it</text>
  <text start="454.35" dur="3.84">is really not North Korea but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="456.66" dur="3.54">seeing right now is we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="458.19" dur="3.66">propaganda build because what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="460.2" dur="3.09">getting ready for and this has been</text>
  <text start="461.85" dur="3.51">planned for a very long time the malware</text>
  <text start="463.29" dur="4.38">has been planted in the financial</text>
  <text start="465.36" dur="4.17">institutions remember because of vault 7</text>
  <text start="467.67" dur="2.85">and everything else everything is set</text>
  <text start="469.53" dur="3.81">and ready to go</text>
  <text start="470.52" dur="7.05">and we can see already there&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="473.34" dur="7.05">make a case of why North Korea will be</text>
  <text start="477.57" dur="6.33">doing this so we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="480.39" dur="5.13">they are on the path to basically have</text>
  <text start="483.9" dur="5.88">the lights-out event which will then</text>
  <text start="485.52" dur="7.11">move into the financial industry getting</text>
  <text start="489.78" dur="4.68">hit by a cyber attack and they will then</text>
  <text start="492.63" dur="3.18">begin the event because they can see</text>
  <text start="494.46" dur="2.61">everything that they&amp;#39;re trying to do out</text>
  <text start="495.81" dur="3.21">in North Korea right now where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="497.07" dur="3.45">trying to get the war started it is not</text>
  <text start="499.02" dur="3.96">working so they need to bring it back</text>
  <text start="500.52" dur="4.86">home here to the United States maybe in</text>
  <text start="502.98" dur="4.47">Europe to get other countries involved</text>
  <text start="505.38" dur="5.46">to say yes we need to go into North</text>
  <text start="507.45" dur="5.45">Korea we see that US destroyers they</text>
  <text start="510.84" dur="5.22">carried out a freedom of navigation</text>
  <text start="512.9" dur="5.11">operation in South China Sea remember</text>
  <text start="516.06" dur="4.53">the United States never signed never</text>
  <text start="518.01" dur="4.14">ratified the freedom of navigation the</text>
  <text start="520.59" dur="4.77">one thing that&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="522.15" dur="6.69">all of this is that the US and US Navy</text>
  <text start="525.36" dur="5.01">destroyer sailed within 12 miles of the</text>
  <text start="528.84" dur="4.95">Paracel Islands in the South China Sea</text>
  <text start="530.37" dur="5.79">in what appears to be the first u.s.</text>
  <text start="533.79" dur="5.1">freedom of navigation operation in two</text>
  <text start="536.16" dur="6.18">months now this was the USS Chaffee a</text>
  <text start="538.89" dur="8.01">guided missile destroyer and it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="542.34" dur="8.31">really break the boundary of the islands</text>
  <text start="546.9" dur="6.48">they sailed outside of the islands so</text>
  <text start="550.65" dur="4.38">basically they really didn&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="553.38" dur="3.84">they were in international waters and it</text>
  <text start="555.03" dur="4.53">really didn&amp;#39;t make a difference but the</text>
  <text start="557.22" dur="4.65">corporate media is out there trying to</text>
  <text start="559.56" dur="4.86">show that oh look we&amp;#39;re showing that we</text>
  <text start="561.87" dur="5.99">have the right to sail in international</text>
  <text start="564.42" dur="6.15">waters of course we do and once again</text>
  <text start="567.86" dur="5.65">the United States never signed to ratify</text>
  <text start="570.57" dur="5.55">the freedom of navigation act whatsoever</text>
  <text start="573.51" dur="4.89">so all of this talk is kind of</text>
  <text start="576.12" dur="4.8">meaningless right now turkey is</text>
  <text start="578.4" dur="4.98">rejecting all meetings without going</text>
  <text start="580.92" dur="5.4">u.s. ambassadors and we can see the</text>
  <text start="583.38" dur="4.89">relationship between Turkey and the US</text>
  <text start="586.32" dur="4.8">well it&amp;#39;s moving further and four</text>
  <text start="588.27" dur="5.31">away and it looks like turkey is now</text>
  <text start="591.12" dur="3.54">moving towards Russia there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="593.58" dur="4.2">countries right now</text>
  <text start="594.66" dur="6.21">that are moving towards Russia moving</text>
  <text start="597.78" dur="6.42">towards China we see right now Russia is</text>
  <text start="600.87" dur="5.73">looking to get involved in peace deals</text>
  <text start="604.2" dur="6.78">between many of the countries they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="606.6" dur="8.55">looking to talk and broker a peace deal</text>
  <text start="610.98" dur="6.18">with Iran and Saudi Arabia and they want</text>
  <text start="615.15" dur="4.08">to de-escalate the situation there and</text>
  <text start="617.16" dur="4.26">Russia is getting involved so this is</text>
  <text start="619.23" dur="4.68">going to be a problem for the United</text>
  <text start="621.42" dur="5.58">States the Cabal because they like</text>
  <text start="623.91" dur="6.24">tension in this area and especially with</text>
  <text start="627" dur="10.59">Israel they like tension between Saudi</text>
  <text start="630.15" dur="9.93">Arabia Iran Jordan Iran Libya Iran they</text>
  <text start="637.59" dur="5.64">want all of this tension there and it</text>
  <text start="640.08" dur="7.08">looks like Russia is stepping in trying</text>
  <text start="643.23" dur="6.18">to smooth everything out we also see</text>
  <text start="647.16" dur="5.04">Russia is looking to talk to Saudi</text>
  <text start="649.41" dur="4.68">Arabia United Arab Emirates where</text>
  <text start="652.2" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re invading Yemen right now and</text>
  <text start="654.09" dur="6.63">maybe broker a peace deal with Saudi</text>
  <text start="657.72" dur="5.64">Arabia the United Arab Emirates and</text>
  <text start="660.72" dur="7.26">Yemen now we know that you the Cabal is</text>
  <text start="663.36" dur="7.62">behind the operation in Yemen and we can</text>
  <text start="667.98" dur="4.62">see that right now everything&amp;#39;s turning</text>
  <text start="670.98" dur="5.58">towards Russia and they&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="672.6" dur="6.87">get involved in this to calm the</text>
  <text start="676.56" dur="5.97">situation down and bring peace to the</text>
  <text start="679.47" dur="5.16">area so Russia has got involved in Syria</text>

  <text start="709.95" dur="5.79">on the outside the Cabal they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="712.2" dur="5.7">their power in the Middle East Putin</text>

  <text start="717.9" dur="3.81">situation China is taking control of the</text>
  <text start="720.57" dur="2.67">situation because they</text>

  <text start="723.24" dur="4.68">the fold for the belt and road for the</text>
  <text start="726" dur="3.48">new economic system and I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="727.92" dur="3.51">this new economic system is going to be</text>
  <text start="729.48" dur="5.22">a lot better it is still run by the</text>
  <text start="731.43" dur="5.1">central banking system we still need to</text>
  <text start="734.7" dur="4.65">get off of the central banking system</text>
  <text start="736.53" dur="4.44">all they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="739.35" dur="4.26">seeing that the dollar is dying</text>
  <text start="740.97" dur="5.67">there&amp;#39;s too much debt they want this</text>
  <text start="743.61" dur="6.51">major major event so they can transfer</text>
  <text start="746.64" dur="6.03">everything to a different area restart</text>
  <text start="750.12" dur="4.77">it and pretend like everything is okay</text>
  <text start="752.67" dur="4.23">after the war now they profit on both</text>
  <text start="754.89" dur="4.41">sides they&amp;#39;ll pay the countries will</text>
  <text start="756.9" dur="4.26">borrow to pay for these wars and when</text>
  <text start="759.3" dur="4.32">all&amp;#39;s said and done the population will</text>
  <text start="761.16" dur="5.49">be reduced and they will then these</text>
  <text start="763.62" dur="5.04">countries will then borrow to rebuild</text>
  <text start="766.65" dur="5.25">and the central bankers sit on the</text>
  <text start="768.66" dur="7.62">outside and they make a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="771.9" dur="6.45">money we also see mountain Syria the</text>
  <text start="776.28" dur="4.44">Free Syrian Army well it looks like</text>
  <text start="778.35" dur="4.8">Jordan has cut their military spending</text>
  <text start="780.72" dur="4.83">and they&amp;#39;re not funding the Free Syrian</text>
  <text start="783.15" dur="5.67">Army so everything that is happening out</text>
  <text start="785.55" dur="7.35">in Syria is completely coming to an end</text>
  <text start="788.82" dur="7.5">at this point and everything is about to</text>
  <text start="792.9" dur="6.03">change in the Middle East and we can see</text>
  <text start="796.32" dur="4.26">slowly but surely this is happening the</text>
  <text start="798.93" dur="4.14">Cabal is losing their power but they</text>
  <text start="800.58" dur="4.92">haven&amp;#39;t given up yet we still need to</text>
  <text start="803.07" dur="5.67">understand something here that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="805.5" dur="5.61">very important the economic system the</text>
  <text start="808.74" dur="5.34">global economic system where the central</text>
  <text start="811.11" dur="5.31">bankers have been pushing a huge amount</text>
  <text start="814.08" dur="4.47">of debt onto the people over the many</text>
  <text start="816.42" dur="4.05">many many years and onto governments</text>
  <text start="818.55" dur="4.62">which then cause austerity which makes</text>
  <text start="820.47" dur="5.91">the country&amp;#39;s struggle to survive</text>
  <text start="823.17" dur="6.3">all of this cannot be sustained they</text>
  <text start="826.38" dur="5.7">have a small window where they need to</text>
  <text start="829.47" dur="5.67">do something to get everyone&amp;#39;s attention</text>
  <text start="832.08" dur="4.68">off of what is about to happen and</text>
  <text start="835.14" dur="5.04">what&amp;#39;s about to happen is that this</text>
  <text start="836.76" dur="5.4">system well it needs to be restarted now</text>
  <text start="840.18" dur="4.8">this is the reset that everyone has been</text>
  <text start="842.16" dur="4.8">talking about but it&amp;#39;s not going to seem</text>
  <text start="844.98" dur="4.86">like a reset if the central bankers have</text>
  <text start="846.96" dur="5.31">their way because of their way of</text>
  <text start="849.84" dur="5.14">resetting something is bringing us to</text>
  <text start="852.27" dur="5.02">war and it looks like</text>
  <text start="854.98" dur="4.799">that&amp;#39;s their main goal because they need</text>
  <text start="857.29" dur="4.409">something really big to keep our</text>
  <text start="859.779" dur="3.571">attention off of what&amp;#39;s really going on</text>
  <text start="861.699" dur="2.971">they need something really big to say</text>
  <text start="863.35" dur="3.599">because of the war</text>
  <text start="864.67" dur="3.84">this is what we need to do we need to</text>
  <text start="866.949" dur="3.241">you know move everything to China</text>
  <text start="868.51" dur="3.42">because they have manufacturing they</text>
  <text start="870.19" dur="4.649">have cold they have the ability to</text>
  <text start="871.93" dur="4.529">sustain everything and this is where</text>
  <text start="874.839" dur="3.3">it&amp;#39;s going to be placed or maybe the</text>
  <text start="876.459" dur="4.68">central bankers will be a separate</text>
  <text start="878.139" dur="4.981">entity altogether and we can see that</text>
  <text start="881.139" dur="4.471">this is where they&amp;#39;re moving this is</text>
  <text start="883.12" dur="4.17">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do and they only</text>
  <text start="885.61" dur="3.96">have a certain period of time because as</text>
  <text start="887.29" dur="3.45">we can see from all the economic</text>
  <text start="889.57" dur="3.69">indicators that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="890.74" dur="4.459">everything is accelerating right now</text>
  <text start="893.26" dur="3.96">it&amp;#39;s not getting better</text>
  <text start="895.199" dur="2.771">Manufacturing is not coming back to the</text>
  <text start="897.22" dur="3.57">United States</text>
  <text start="897.97" dur="5.28">these NAFTA negotiations and all this</text>
  <text start="900.79" dur="4.349">other stuff it&amp;#39;s not going to work we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="903.25" dur="4.26">at the endpoint right now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="905.139" dur="3.901">nothing the United States can do to fix</text>
  <text start="907.51" dur="2.91">the problem yes they can manipulate the</text>
  <text start="909.04" dur="3.51">numbers even further to make it look</text>
  <text start="910.42" dur="5.479">better but eventually what happens it</text>
  <text start="912.55" dur="7.56">all falls apart they manipulated the</text>
  <text start="915.899" dur="6.49">subprime securities remember S&amp;amp;P Moody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="920.11" dur="3.63">they all said it was triple-a that was</text>
  <text start="922.389" dur="2.871">manipulated they knew they were</text>
  <text start="923.74" dur="4.68">defaulting they knew what was happening</text>
  <text start="925.26" dur="5.92">but they manipulated it over the many</text>
  <text start="928.42" dur="6.599">many years to make everyone believe that</text>
  <text start="931.18" dur="6.81">everything was fine until it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="935.019" dur="5.611">until individuals decided to look into</text>
  <text start="937.99" dur="4.74">this and say well wait a minute they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="940.63" dur="3.959">telling us is triple-a but we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="942.73" dur="4.4">defaults how are they keeping these</text>
  <text start="944.589" dur="5.221">things going well they do it through</text>
  <text start="947.13" dur="4.63">manipulation the same thing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="949.81" dur="5.49">doing right now with the economy they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="951.76" dur="6.559">keeping the economy operational through</text>
  <text start="955.3" dur="7.11">manipulation but what happens is</text>
  <text start="958.319" dur="7.77">manipulation can only do so much before</text>
  <text start="962.41" dur="6.479">the real the truth the real economy</text>
  <text start="966.089" dur="5.23">shines through and this is what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="968.889" dur="5.161">been seeing all along with retail</text>
  <text start="971.319" dur="4.561">imploding the housing market starting to</text>
  <text start="974.05" dur="4.56">fall we&amp;#39;re starting to see that these</text>
  <text start="975.88" dur="5.069">numbers of job numbers GDP numbers they</text>
  <text start="978.61" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t even make any sense anymore we</text>
  <text start="980.949" dur="3.691">have proof that people aren&amp;#39;t getting</text>
  <text start="982.75" dur="3.81">better high and paying jobs because the</text>
  <text start="984.64" dur="4.35">tax receipts to the federal government</text>
  <text start="986.56" dur="4.38">is continually declining wages are</text>
  <text start="988.99" dur="5.1">continually declining we&amp;#39;re seeing signs</text>
  <text start="990.94" dur="6.54">of inflation in food corporate earnings</text>
  <text start="994.09" dur="5.55">is a gigantic manipulation they&amp;#39;re men</text>
  <text start="997.48" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re figuring out all</text>
  <text start="999.64" dur="4.44">different programs to allow people to</text>
  <text start="1001.95" dur="4.079">buy more cars remember they&amp;#39;re not using</text>
  <text start="1004.08" dur="4.62">any money of their own to buy more</text>
  <text start="1006.029" dur="4.651">houses and to get rid of their student</text>
  <text start="1008.7" dur="3.51">loans or get help to pay off their</text>
  <text start="1010.68" dur="4.32">student loan so they don&amp;#39;t default so</text>
  <text start="1012.21" dur="6.12">they&amp;#39;re trying to do everything at the</text>
  <text start="1015" dur="4.86">last minute but guess what it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1018.33" dur="3.72">going to work it might work for a little</text>
  <text start="1019.86" dur="5.25">while but eventually all this</text>
  <text start="1022.05" dur="5.94">manipulation all this gigantic illusion</text>
  <text start="1025.11" dur="5.219">will come to an end this is why the</text>
  <text start="1027.99" dur="3.99">planning for the lights-out event this</text>
  <text start="1030.329" dur="3.391">is why they&amp;#39;re building the propaganda</text>
  <text start="1031.98" dur="4.53">right now this is why they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="1033.72" dur="7.14">to wait because they have nothing left</text>
  <text start="1036.51" dur="6.179">and this event this next event is going</text>
  <text start="1040.86" dur="2.82">to be the event of all events and this</text>
  <text start="1042.689" dur="2.551">is what we&amp;#39;re looking at we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1043.68" dur="3.57">where exactly it&amp;#39;s going to come from I</text>
  <text start="1045.24" dur="3.9">mean it might start out in North Korea</text>
  <text start="1047.25" dur="3.84">where they fire a missile they might try</text>
  <text start="1049.14" dur="3.47">to hit Guam or Japan or they make</text>
  <text start="1051.09" dur="4.77">something up that they actually did this</text>
  <text start="1052.61" dur="5.38">we might then see a cyber attack in</text>
  <text start="1055.86" dur="5.01">Europe then in the United States where</text>
  <text start="1057.99" dur="4.95">certain cities go out go dark in Europe</text>
  <text start="1060.87" dur="4.26">they go dark but there&amp;#39;s still enough</text>
  <text start="1062.94" dur="4.29">people with lights on see what is going</text>
  <text start="1065.13" dur="4.62">on then they might hit the financial</text>

  <text start="1077.82" dur="3.93">everyone and they&amp;#39;ve been planning this</text>
  <text start="1079.92" dur="3.48">for a very long time because they knew</text>
