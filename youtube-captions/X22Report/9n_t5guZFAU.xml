  <text start="86.21" dur="5.99">because whoever gains the narrative well</text>
  <text start="88.46" dur="7.47">they&amp;#39;re going to create the new economy</text>
  <text start="92.2" dur="5.919">from the old economy and you need to</text>
  <text start="95.93" dur="4.799">have the narrative to tell the story of</text>
  <text start="98.119" dur="4.411">what happened why it&amp;#39;s never gonna</text>
  <text start="100.729" dur="3.931">happen again and how we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="102.53" dur="4.199">create it where it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot</text>
  <text start="104.66" dur="5.069">better than it was now the central bank</text>
  <text start="106.729" dur="5.731">controls the narrative they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="109.729" dur="4.28">going to tell us that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>

  <text start="118.13" dur="4.469">going to restart their system make us</text>
  <text start="120.56" dur="5.25">think it&amp;#39;s a different system and then</text>
  <text start="122.599" dur="6.931">as time goes on bring us into the same</text>
  <text start="125.81" dur="6.75">exact system that we&amp;#39;re in today Trump</text>
  <text start="129.53" dur="5.61">on the other hand his plan is to remove</text>
  <text start="132.56" dur="6.539">the central banks to get rid of them to</text>
  <text start="135.14" dur="6.959">get rid of the old system to bring in a</text>
  <text start="139.099" dur="5.97">new system a system that will work with</text>
  <text start="142.099" dur="4.291">the people and what we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="145.069" dur="3.991">see is that the people are starting to</text>
  <text start="146.39" dur="5.25">realize that the economy&amp;#39;s not doing as</text>
  <text start="149.06" dur="4.38">well as Trump is saying it&amp;#39;s doing as</text>
  <text start="151.64" dur="3.36">the corporate media is saying it&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="153.44" dur="3.69">as the central bank saying it&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="155" dur="4.41">and people are starting to catch on that</text>
  <text start="157.13" dur="5.27">something&amp;#39;s going on here now Trump is</text>
  <text start="159.41" dur="6">already started to push the tariffs</text>
  <text start="162.4" dur="4.33">reciprocal taxes and people are very</text>
  <text start="165.41" dur="3.36">concerned about this and we can see the</text>
  <text start="166.73" dur="3.869">human consumer confidence well it is</text>
  <text start="168.77" dur="4.53">tumbling right now and people are</text>
  <text start="170.599" dur="5.161">looking at the economy and saying oh</text>
  <text start="173.3" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;re not too sure about it right now</text>
  <text start="175.76" dur="5.28">and we can see because of the negative</text>
  <text start="178.52" dur="4.83">economic developments which is being</text>
  <text start="181.04" dur="3.69">reported by the court media saying that</text>
  <text start="183.35" dur="3.03">these tariffs are terrible we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="184.73" dur="3.9">entering trade Wars</text>
  <text start="186.38" dur="4.26">and they&amp;#39;re gonna push this because that</text>
  <text start="188.63" dur="4.2">is going to be their narrative their</text>
  <text start="190.64" dur="4.53">narrative is to blame Trump on the</text>
  <text start="192.83" dur="4.43">economy coming down Trump on the other</text>
  <text start="195.17" dur="4.74">hand has to bring the economy down and</text>
  <text start="197.26" dur="4.3">pivot away from what he&amp;#39;s doing and</text>
  <text start="199.91" dur="4.5">pivot towards the central bank and</text>
  <text start="201.56" dur="5.61">explain that during this whole period of</text>
  <text start="204.41" dur="5.16">time it wasn&amp;#39;t what he did it was what</text>
  <text start="207.17" dur="5.43">the central bank did over many many many</text>
  <text start="209.57" dur="6.51">years and he&amp;#39;s gonna have to show and</text>
  <text start="212.6" dur="5.73">prove what they&amp;#39;ve been doing now he can</text>
  <text start="216.08" dur="4.44">do this with an audit and I think this</text>
  <text start="218.33" dur="3.51">is in the works where eventually what</text>
  <text start="220.52" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re going to do as things start to</text>
  <text start="221.84" dur="4.8">fall apart and as we could see if they</text>
  <text start="224.03" dur="4.65">are falling apart he&amp;#39;s going to pull out</text>
  <text start="226.64" dur="4.74">that card and say we maybe we should</text>
  <text start="228.68" dur="5.22">audit the Fed just like maybe we should</text>
  <text start="231.38" dur="5.13">look into regulating social media maybe</text>
  <text start="233.9" dur="4.89">we should have an an internet Bill of</text>
  <text start="236.51" dur="5.25">Rights maybe we this is this is how he</text>
  <text start="238.79" dur="6.54">works now what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="241.76" dur="5.01">that job openings they&amp;#39;re tumbling they</text>
  <text start="245.33" dur="4.38">tumbled by a hundred and seventy six</text>
  <text start="246.77" dur="6.75">thousand now why is this important well</text>
  <text start="249.71" dur="7.17">if we go back in time and right before</text>
  <text start="253.52" dur="5.55">the Great Recession in 2008 job hirez</text>
  <text start="256.88" dur="5.82">verse 12 months cumulative change in</text>
  <text start="259.07" dur="7.02">payrolls well it was increasing until we</text>
  <text start="262.7" dur="6.48">hit a certain point in 2006 and then it</text>
  <text start="266.09" dur="6.36">started to decline what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="269.18" dur="5.97">right now is we&amp;#39;re in the decline phase</text>
  <text start="272.45" dur="5.99">of total hires the same thing that has</text>
  <text start="275.15" dur="6.59">happened back in 2007 going into 2008</text>
  <text start="278.44" dur="6.07">which means we are headed towards a</text>
  <text start="281.74" dur="6.76">recession a depression we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="284.51" dur="9.39">same exact indicators now if I look at</text>
  <text start="288.5" dur="7.77">the chart I can see from 2003 to 2006 we</text>
  <text start="293.9" dur="4.59">were increasing job hires everything was</text>
  <text start="296.27" dur="7.14">going smoothly and we saw this on the</text>
  <text start="298.49" dur="7.74">graph if we go back to 2009 to 2010 we</text>
  <text start="303.41" dur="6.51">had this sharp increase of job hires and</text>
  <text start="306.23" dur="5.1">then we stagnated on top and ever since</text>
  <text start="309.92" dur="3.87">2015</text>
  <text start="311.33" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;ve been declining and it&amp;#39;s starting</text>
  <text start="313.79" dur="3.689">to pick up speed right now and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="315.83" dur="4.29">gonna see this pick up speed and once it</text>
  <text start="317.479" dur="5.791">starts to pick up speed to the downside</text>
  <text start="320.12" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re gonna see a recession and it looks</text>
  <text start="323.27" dur="3.209">like from all the indicators that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="324.56" dur="3.96">been seeing that this recession is</text>
  <text start="326.479" dur="3.571">coming very soon now I do believe that</text>
  <text start="328.52" dur="4.17">we&amp;#39;ve been in a recession I think this</text>
  <text start="330.05" dur="4.29">is gonna be a total all-out collapse of</text>
  <text start="332.69" dur="5.4">the entire system</text>
  <text start="334.34" dur="6.09">and here&amp;#39;s another indicator JP Morgan</text>
  <text start="338.09" dur="5.579">they are credit-card charge offs they</text>
  <text start="340.43" dur="5.34">are surging right now to six year highs</text>
  <text start="343.669" dur="4.56">remember we talked about delinquencies</text>
  <text start="345.77" dur="4.679">and how they are rising right now well</text>
  <text start="348.229" dur="4.41">JP Morgan&amp;#39;s that credit card charge offs</text>
  <text start="350.449" dur="5.041">they&amp;#39;ve been steadily rising passing one</text>
  <text start="352.639" dur="5.611">billion in the second quarter of 2017</text>
  <text start="355.49" dur="7.62">and as of the first quarter of 2018</text>
  <text start="358.25" dur="8.61">we&amp;#39;re at 1.17 billion back to the levels</text>
  <text start="363.11" dur="5.55">last seen in June of 2012 that was six</text>
  <text start="366.86" dur="4.98">years ago we&amp;#39;re supposed to be in this</text>
  <text start="368.66" dur="5.46">incredible recovery and how can we be</text>
  <text start="371.84" dur="2.9">where we were six years ago it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="374.12" dur="3.54">make sense</text>
  <text start="374.74" dur="6.04">now Jamie Dimon was out there saying</text>
  <text start="377.66" dur="6.27">that the US consumer is doing really</text>
  <text start="380.78" dur="4.56">what really really well and they&amp;#39;re okay</text>
  <text start="383.93" dur="2.97">but when you look at what has been</text>
  <text start="385.34" dur="4.44">happening here with these charge-offs</text>
  <text start="386.9" dur="5.94">it looks like the US consumer is not</text>
  <text start="389.78" dur="5.1">doing all that hot afterall and it looks</text>
  <text start="392.84" dur="4.23">like he was just out there saying</text>
  <text start="394.88" dur="4.5">whatever as they usually do this is what</text>
  <text start="397.07" dur="6.599">banker central bankers do they just talk</text>
  <text start="399.38" dur="7.409">and there&amp;#39;s no facts or reality backing</text>
  <text start="403.669" dur="5.97">them up now in the housing industry we</text>
  <text start="406.789" dur="5.701">know back during the financial crisis</text>
  <text start="409.639" dur="5.041">the subprime mortgages they were a huge</text>
  <text start="412.49" dur="4.62">problem and of course everyone said</text>
  <text start="414.68" dur="3.75">never again never again and we see the</text>
  <text start="417.11" dur="3.66">same thing happening in the auto</text>
  <text start="418.43" dur="5.28">industry there is a huge amount of debt</text>
  <text start="420.77" dur="6.179">in credit cards now there&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="423.71" dur="5">amount of debt globally there&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="426.949" dur="6.9">amount of debt in the United States</text>
  <text start="428.71" dur="8.65">corporate government private debt is way</text>
  <text start="433.849" dur="8.311">up and we know that the housing market</text>
  <text start="437.36" dur="7.589">had a huge huge problem back in 2008 and</text>
  <text start="442.16" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s never recovered yes they&amp;#39;ve gone to</text>
  <text start="444.949" dur="4.351">20 different cities they pumped the</text>
  <text start="446.81" dur="4.59">prices up and when people see prices go</text>
  <text start="449.3" dur="4.29">up they feel good their house is</text>
  <text start="451.4" dur="4.38">appreciating of course it&amp;#39;s all on paper</text>
  <text start="453.59" dur="5.46">and it makes them feel like everything</text>
  <text start="455.78" dur="5.85">is great and they go out and spend this</text>
  <text start="459.05" dur="6.51">is what they tried to do it didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="461.63" dur="6.21">people you know had no jobs they working</text>
  <text start="465.56" dur="4.26">part-time jobs their income level</text>
  <text start="467.84" dur="3.9">continually dropped the people coming</text>
  <text start="469.82" dur="3.81">out of college couldn&amp;#39;t find those</text>
  <text start="471.74" dur="3.93">high-paying jobs and that&amp;#39;s why the</text>
  <text start="473.63" dur="2.76">retail market is a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="475.67" dur="4.17">disaster</text>
  <text start="476.39" dur="6.12">well the subprime mortgage industry that</text>
  <text start="479.84" dur="6.15">vanished during the Great Recession well</text>
  <text start="482.51" dur="6.3">it&amp;#39;s back and they just changed the name</text>
  <text start="485.99" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s called the non-prime market instead</text>
  <text start="488.81" dur="4.95">of the subprime market it&amp;#39;s now the</text>
  <text start="490.82" dur="5.49">non-prime market and Carrington mortgage</text>
  <text start="493.76" dur="4.85">is now offering mortgages to borrowers</text>
  <text start="496.31" dur="4.56">with less than perfect credit and</text>
  <text start="498.61" dur="5.98">they&amp;#39;re starting to put these together</text>
  <text start="500.87" dur="6.75">and again we&amp;#39;ve seen this all before</text>
  <text start="504.59" dur="7.11">everything is repeating once again as</text>
  <text start="507.62" dur="5.61">the economy completely breaks down now</text>
  <text start="511.7" dur="5.36">all over the corporate media we see</text>
  <text start="513.23" dur="7.17">there&amp;#39;s a news report about Trump</text>
  <text start="517.06" dur="6.28">talking about let&amp;#39;s look at the TPP once</text>
  <text start="520.4" dur="5.13">again the trans-pacific partnership even</text>
  <text start="523.34" dur="4.68">though he basically got rid of it as</text>
  <text start="525.53" dur="4.08">soon as he got into office said no this</text>
  <text start="528.02" dur="2.31">whole thing is a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="529.61" dur="3.48">disaster</text>
  <text start="530.33" dur="4.2">he also said NAFTA this needs to be we</text>
  <text start="533.09" dur="4.41">worked let&amp;#39;s try to get rid of it but if</text>
  <text start="534.53" dur="5.13">ket but again those individuals in the</text>
  <text start="537.5" dur="3.78">banking industry and deep state they</text>
  <text start="539.66" dur="3.18">made it very very difficult just to get</text>
  <text start="541.28" dur="4.29">rid of NAFTA because he needs Congress</text>
  <text start="542.84" dur="4.89">to vote on different parts of it so the</text>
  <text start="545.57" dur="5.46">whole thing had to be reworked and this</text>
  <text start="547.73" dur="6.62">is why they&amp;#39;re in there today discussing</text>
  <text start="551.03" dur="7.61">NAFTA trying to come out with a new deal</text>
  <text start="554.35" dur="7.3">now the TPP was killed because it failed</text>
  <text start="558.64" dur="5.86">America&amp;#39;s workers and it should remain</text>
  <text start="561.65" dur="7.47">dead we should not bring it back in its</text>
  <text start="564.5" dur="7.17">current form but he did come out and say</text>
  <text start="569.12" dur="4.92">he wanted a look at the TPP and you have</text>
  <text start="571.67" dur="4.08">to question why why all of a sudden if</text>
  <text start="574.04" dur="2.85">he killed it and said this is not good</text>
  <text start="575.75" dur="4.52">for America that was one of the first</text>
  <text start="576.89" dur="5.49">things he did why look at it again and</text>
  <text start="580.27" dur="3.91">Trump clarified that he would continue</text>
  <text start="582.38" dur="3.78">to seek bilateral trade deals with the</text>
  <text start="584.18" dur="4.29">TPP nations</text>
  <text start="586.16" dur="4.619">and specifically called out unfair trade</text>
  <text start="588.47" dur="4.77">practices with Japan he said we already</text>
  <text start="590.779" dur="5.401">have bilateral deals with six of the 11</text>
  <text start="593.24" dur="4.62">nations in TPP and are working to make a</text>
  <text start="596.18" dur="4.949">deal with the biggest of those nations</text>
  <text start="597.86" dur="6.719">Japan who has hit us hard on trade for</text>
  <text start="601.129" dur="9.981">years and the question is why is he</text>
  <text start="604.579" dur="8.82">looking at the TPP if he killed it well</text>
  <text start="611.11" dur="6.94">the obama-clinton</text>
  <text start="613.399" dur="7.62">the central bankers deep state TPP was</text>
  <text start="618.05" dur="6.029">formed and written to inhibit China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="621.019" dur="5.731">economic dominance instead of China</text>
  <text start="624.079" dur="5.7">creating the one belt one road they were</text>
  <text start="626.75" dur="5.399">going to counter that with TPP and they</text>
  <text start="629.779" dur="4.831">wanted all the countries to join the TPP</text>
  <text start="632.149" dur="4.951">and pretty much leave China out of it</text>
  <text start="634.61" dur="5.18">and the other part of the TPP was to set</text>
  <text start="637.1" dur="5.099">up this court system that would be above</text>
  <text start="639.79" dur="5.049">all governments they would make the</text>
  <text start="642.199" dur="5.221">decisions now this was to usher in the</text>
  <text start="644.839" dur="4.74">globalist agenda to have a one-world</text>
  <text start="647.42" dur="4.62">government because governments then</text>
  <text start="649.579" dur="4.62">would not be controlling their decisions</text>
  <text start="652.04" dur="5.07">in their country the court system would</text>
  <text start="654.199" dur="4.74">be controlling the decisions plus it</text>
  <text start="657.11" dur="5.279">would put all the countries on an even</text>
  <text start="658.939" dur="5.7">playing field for example if workers</text>
  <text start="662.389" dur="4.8">came from a different country into the</text>
  <text start="664.639" dur="6.031">United States they would be paid at</text>
  <text start="667.189" dur="5.101">their country&amp;#39;s pay level that means the</text>
  <text start="670.67" dur="3.96">people here in the United States would</text>
  <text start="672.29" dur="5.34">have to come down to that pay level and</text>
  <text start="674.63" dur="4.74">this is why we had a lot of illegal</text>
  <text start="677.63" dur="5.34">immigrants coming into this country</text>
  <text start="679.37" dur="7.019">because they needed a huge number of</text>
  <text start="682.97" dur="6.45">these individuals to basically take</text>
  <text start="686.389" dur="5.13">those jobs because most Americans would</text>
  <text start="689.42" dur="4.38">probably say no you know something I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="691.519" dur="4.56">not I&amp;#39;m not getting $3 an hour here and</text>
  <text start="693.8" dur="4.8">of course what would that would do it</text>
  <text start="696.079" dur="5.19">would push many of the American workers</text>
  <text start="698.6" dur="4.5">out of all of these jobs now what they</text>
  <text start="701.269" dur="4.32">the reason why they wanted to do this is</text>
  <text start="703.1" dur="4.529">because they wanted all countries under</text>
  <text start="705.589" dur="3.99">the globalist agenda to be on an even</text>
  <text start="707.629" dur="3.93">playing field where you don&amp;#39;t have one</text>
  <text start="709.579" dur="3.271">country where you get paid higher and</text>
  <text start="711.559" dur="3.21">another country where we get paid lower</text>
  <text start="712.85" dur="4.32">everyone gets the same so they can move</text>
  <text start="714.769" dur="5.131">workers all around because everyone is</text>
  <text start="717.17" dur="5.43">the same and they can control</text>
  <text start="719.9" dur="5.19">all of this well that was thrown out</text>
  <text start="722.6" dur="5.94">that&amp;#39;s what Trump did he said this is</text>
  <text start="725.09" dur="7.32">not good for our country he is looking</text>
  <text start="728.54" dur="5.55">at TPP not at the court system not at</text>
  <text start="732.41" dur="5.73">any of those pieces but at the free</text>
  <text start="734.09" dur="9.14">trade part and the reason why he is</text>
  <text start="738.14" dur="10.68">looking at this is because the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="743.23" dur="8.89">looking to join China&amp;#39;s trade system the</text>
  <text start="748.82" dur="6.45">TPP&amp;#39;s goal is to serve as the foundation</text>
  <text start="752.12" dur="5.82">for the much larger free trade area of</text>
  <text start="755.27" dur="4.71">the Asia Pacific which would not only</text>
  <text start="757.94" dur="4.53">include the United States but all APEC</text>
  <text start="759.98" dur="7.35">member states including China and Russia</text>
  <text start="762.47" dur="8.1">now the TPP would be the engine fuelling</text>
  <text start="767.33" dur="5.79">the drive toward a future unified</text>
  <text start="770.57" dur="4.92">asia-pacific regional bloc in which the</text>
  <text start="773.12" dur="5.85">United States would be relegated to a</text>
  <text start="775.49" dur="9.27">subordinate Member State with China</text>
  <text start="778.97" dur="10.34">Russia at the helm Trump realizes that</text>
  <text start="784.76" dur="8.19">China Russia the one belt one road their</text>
  <text start="789.31" dur="6.55">trading system that they&amp;#39;re putting into</text>
  <text start="792.95" dur="5.82">place right now that is the dominant</text>
  <text start="795.86" dur="5.49">trade system yes Trump is making</text>
  <text start="798.77" dur="5.1">bilateral trade deals all over the place</text>
  <text start="801.35" dur="5.91">but he realizes he needs to put</text>
  <text start="803.87" dur="6.24">something into place to link us with</text>
  <text start="807.26" dur="5.37">China and this is what is happening</text>
  <text start="810.11" dur="3.87">right now now we&amp;#39;ve been saying this all</text>
  <text start="812.63" dur="3.36">along that eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="813.98" dur="6.09">happen is that Trump is going to move</text>
  <text start="815.99" dur="6.36">towards this position where the United</text>
  <text start="820.07" dur="4.92">States will have to join the one belt</text>
  <text start="822.35" dur="5.13">one Road because our trade the way it is</text>
  <text start="824.99" dur="6.27">today has to change because once the</text>
  <text start="827.48" dur="5.19">petro dollar is gone our trade will have</text>
  <text start="831.26" dur="3.69">to change and this is why he&amp;#39;s setting</text>
  <text start="832.67" dur="6.09">up all all these bilateral trade deals</text>
  <text start="834.95" dur="6.36">and this is why we need to join the one</text>
  <text start="838.76" dur="4.44">belt one Road because if we don&amp;#39;t join</text>
  <text start="841.31" dur="4.71">this the United States will be left out</text>
  <text start="843.2" dur="4.68">in the cold this is why he&amp;#39;s setting up</text>
  <text start="846.02" dur="4.47">all these tariffs this is why he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="847.88" dur="4.38">pushing the system to the edge with</text>
  <text start="850.49" dur="2.82">spending and everything else because the</text>
  <text start="852.26" dur="3.3">system that were in today</text>
  <text start="853.31" dur="5.25">needs to go away it needs to be</text>
  <text start="855.56" dur="5.819">completely reset and rebuilt remember</text>
  <text start="858.56" dur="6.24">this is a central banking system that</text>
  <text start="861.379" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;ve created for us from 1913 on it</text>
  <text start="864.8" dur="4.979">took many many years to create it we</text>
  <text start="866.959" dur="5.13">need to completely destroy it and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="869.779" dur="6.3">doing whatever he possibly can to gain</text>
  <text start="872.089" dur="6.69">the narrative destroy the system and get</text>
  <text start="876.079" dur="7.05">rid of the central bank and bring online</text>
  <text start="878.779" dur="7.86">the new economic system that&amp;#39;s the whole</text>
  <text start="883.129" dur="5.43">entire goal here and this is what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="886.639" dur="4.351">doing now in the meantime he&amp;#39;s putting</text>
  <text start="888.559" dur="6.96">every all the pieces into place to</text>
  <text start="890.99" dur="6.389">support the new economic system that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="895.519" dur="3.961">what is being done right now</text>
  <text start="897.379" dur="4.2">so we can see right now that we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="899.48" dur="3.45">be going through this reset it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="901.579" dur="3.541">be very bumpy it&amp;#39;s gonna be very</text>
  <text start="902.93" dur="4.44">difficult for many people people who are</text>
  <text start="905.12" dur="4.199">not paying attention on what is going on</text>
  <text start="907.37" dur="4.439">who are not prepared who don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="909.319" dur="6.27">crypto currencies that don&amp;#39;t have gold</text>
  <text start="911.809" dur="6.75">or silver that don&amp;#39;t have food water</text>
  <text start="915.589" dur="6.3">supplies medical supplies cash on hand</text>
  <text start="918.559" dur="6.39">because when the system goes down credit</text>
  <text start="921.889" dur="7.831">will freeze up supplies will be hard to</text>
  <text start="924.949" dur="6.721">get and the inflation will hit and this</text>
  <text start="929.72" dur="3.39">is why you need cash on hand because you</text>
  <text start="931.67" dur="4.289">want to use that up first</text>
  <text start="933.11" dur="4.709">once that is depleted most likely will</text>
  <text start="935.959" dur="2.761">go into bartering and then maybe</text>
  <text start="937.819" dur="2.671">cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="938.72" dur="4.26">will go online the gold and silver is</text>
  <text start="940.49" dur="6.569">basically to ensure your wealth and</text>
  <text start="942.98" dur="6.81">you&amp;#39;ll use that much later on and if</text>
  <text start="947.059" dur="5.191">you&amp;#39;re prepared you will be able to</text>
  <text start="949.79" dur="4.08">weather the storm think about it when we</text>
  <text start="952.25" dur="4.74">came off the gold standard and went on</text>
  <text start="953.87" dur="4.529">to the petro dollar everything changed</text>
  <text start="956.99" dur="3.599">back then but we were still the reserve</text>

  <text start="960.589" dur="5.071">the reserve currency everything&amp;#39;s going</text>
