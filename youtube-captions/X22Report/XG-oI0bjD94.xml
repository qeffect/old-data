  <text start="175.489" dur="8.161">those people who are in government in</text>
  <text start="179.76" dur="5.49">Congress who are implicated in this are</text>

  <text start="200.849" dur="3.181">be able to make heads or tails of it</text>
  <text start="202.53" dur="3.569">know what he&amp;#39;s really saying is if it</text>
  <text start="204.03" dur="4.739">gets out there most likely his career is</text>
  <text start="206.099" dur="5.071">finished maybe many other people many a</text>

  <text start="211.17" dur="5.849">jail a lot of people are going to be in</text>
  <text start="214.44" dur="5.159">a lot of trouble and we can see that</text>
  <text start="217.019" dur="4.891">many people are probably very very</text>
  <text start="219.599" dur="4.831">nervous there because once this gets out</text>
  <text start="221.91" dur="5.7">it&amp;#39;s going to lead to many other things</text>
  <text start="224.43" dur="6.08">it&amp;#39;s not just one thing and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="227.61" dur="5.31">to have a snowball effect and eventually</text>
  <text start="230.51" dur="4.21">everyone&amp;#39;s going to be looking around</text>
  <text start="232.92" dur="3.51">saying okay what are you up to what are</text>
  <text start="234.72" dur="4.29">you up to and there&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="236.43" dur="5.279">investigations all over the place this</text>
  <text start="239.01" dur="6.53">is where this is really headed this is</text>
  <text start="241.709" dur="7.291">what is called cleaning out government</text>
  <text start="245.54" dur="5.83">now they started out very slowly to get</text>
  <text start="249" dur="5.1">the public used to the idea that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="251.37" dur="5.13">corruption that there&amp;#39;s sex rings</text>
  <text start="254.1" dur="6.27">there&amp;#39;s pedo rings there&amp;#39;s corruption</text>
  <text start="256.5" dur="6.86">and this is why Trump way back started</text>
  <text start="260.37" dur="5.9">to talk about you know being spied on</text>
  <text start="263.36" dur="5.8">about how they did things without</text>
  <text start="266.27" dur="5.17">authorization who did it when he was</text>
  <text start="269.16" dur="5.61">campaigning he said Clinton would be in</text>
  <text start="271.44" dur="5.039">jail he was laying all of this out to</text>
  <text start="274.77" dur="3.81">get everyone used to the idea now of</text>
  <text start="276.479" dur="4.111">course everyone took it as a joke</text>
  <text start="278.58" dur="4.11">everyone laughed like haha he has no</text>
  <text start="280.59" dur="5.43">proof whatsoever he&amp;#39;s making this stuff</text>
  <text start="282.69" dur="5.15">up he&amp;#39;s crazy and it turns out that most</text>
  <text start="286.02" dur="5.01">of the stuff that he&amp;#39;s been saying is</text>
  <text start="287.84" dur="6.67">the truth remember he has this</text>
  <text start="291.03" dur="6.24">information already he already knows</text>
  <text start="294.51" dur="4.409">what they&amp;#39;ve done they know that he</text>
  <text start="297.27" dur="3.24">knows what they&amp;#39;ve done that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="298.919" dur="3.961">want to get rid of him that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="300.51" dur="4.409">want him out of the White House this is</text>
  <text start="302.88" dur="5.159">why they&amp;#39;re talking about a heart attack</text>
  <text start="304.919" dur="6.381">this is why they&amp;#39;re talking about oh he</text>
  <text start="308.039" dur="5.641">could have won any minute and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="311.3" dur="3.94">building this up to make everyone</text>
  <text start="313.68" dur="4.38">believe that he&amp;#39;ll just have a heart</text>
  <text start="315.24" dur="4.53">attack naturally and we&amp;#39;ll just have the</text>
  <text start="318.06" dur="3">next person come in line and be</text>
  <text start="319.77" dur="2.64">president and we</text>
  <text start="321.06" dur="3.329">had to worry about him because the next</text>
  <text start="322.41" dur="3.78">person in line is pence and we can</text>
  <text start="324.389" dur="5.421">control him and then this brings me back</text>
  <text start="326.19" dur="7.26">to the CI a heart attack gun which they</text>
  <text start="329.81" dur="5.02">actually have and they use it to make it</text>
  <text start="333.45" dur="4.56">look like people have died of natural</text>
  <text start="334.83" dur="6.36">causes which is a heart attack and it</text>
  <text start="338.01" dur="5.82">doesn&amp;#39;t really leave any signs that you</text>
  <text start="341.19" dur="5.22">know they they were murdered and we see</text>
  <text start="343.83" dur="3.9">right now from all this information</text>
  <text start="346.41" dur="3.3">coming out from all the texts that are</text>
  <text start="347.73" dur="4.32">coming out with the secret society and</text>
  <text start="349.71" dur="8.19">how they wanted to get rid of Trump all</text>
  <text start="352.05" dur="9">this is coming out and it&amp;#39;s all turning</text>
  <text start="357.9" dur="6.09">out to be true now the Department of</text>
  <text start="361.05" dur="5.55">Justice is moving forward they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="363.99" dur="6.87">demanding demanding sanctuary cities</text>
  <text start="366.6" dur="6.45">turn over law enforcement documents now</text>
  <text start="370.86" dur="3.75">remember he&amp;#39;s been battling this because</text>
  <text start="373.05" dur="2.82">there are a lot of illegal immigrants</text>
  <text start="374.61" dur="2.79">and I&amp;#39;m talking about illegal see</text>
  <text start="375.87" dur="3.18">there&amp;#39;s a the reason why they used the</text>
  <text start="377.4" dur="4.32">word illegal is because they came into</text>
  <text start="379.05" dur="4.619">this country illegally they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="381.72" dur="4.68">supposed to be here they didn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="383.669" dur="4.801">through the process that everyone else</text>
  <text start="386.4" dur="3.96">goes through that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re called</text>
  <text start="388.47" dur="2.88">illegals and of course the corporate</text>
  <text start="390.36" dur="2.94">media doesn&amp;#39;t want anymore</text>
  <text start="391.35" dur="4.68">anyone to use that term because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="393.3" dur="4.619">derogatory but that&amp;#39;s what happens when</text>
  <text start="396.03" dur="4.199">you cross the border you don&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="397.919" dur="4.711">through the proper vetting and</text>
  <text start="400.229" dur="5.221">everything else you&amp;#39;re illegally in this</text>
  <text start="402.63" dur="5.19">country if we decided to go to another</text>
  <text start="405.45" dur="3.719">country you me or anyone else and you</text>
  <text start="407.82" dur="5.099">hop their border and you went into their</text>
  <text start="409.169" dur="7.261">country you&amp;#39;re there illegally I mean</text>
  <text start="412.919" dur="6.331">this is how it works but of course they</text>
  <text start="416.43" dur="4.709">don&amp;#39;t want to admit that this is what is</text>
  <text start="419.25" dur="4.62">happening because they need these</text>
  <text start="421.139" dur="5.011">individuals they need them in here for a</text>
  <text start="423.87" dur="4.859">certain agenda and that is of course</text>
  <text start="426.15" dur="6.03">when they were in power when they had</text>
  <text start="428.729" dur="5.791">full power it was about voting it was</text>
  <text start="432.18" dur="6.93">about taking the low level paying jobs</text>
  <text start="434.52" dur="6.149">it was about taking Obamacare and it was</text>
  <text start="439.11" dur="4.35">about many different things and also</text>
  <text start="440.669" dur="5.401">when you increase the population GDP</text>
  <text start="443.46" dur="4.079">goes up and they were hoping that they</text>
  <text start="446.07" dur="4.11">were read they were preparing the</text>
  <text start="447.539" dur="4.411">country for a one-world government the</text>
  <text start="450.18" dur="2.95">US was going to be brought down to a</text>
  <text start="451.95" dur="3.4">third world nation</text>
  <text start="453.13" dur="4.11">and the salaries were gonna drop</text>
  <text start="455.35" dur="3.9">dramatically they needed these people in</text>
  <text start="457.24" dur="4.11">here to take up the slack because they</text>
  <text start="459.25" dur="4.89">knew Americans would not take those jobs</text>
  <text start="461.35" dur="6.48">and eventually everyone would have to</text>
  <text start="464.14" dur="6.09">lower their salaries to this level and</text>
  <text start="467.83" dur="4.5">this is how they were going to try to do</text>
  <text start="470.23" dur="3.78">this but of course this didn&amp;#39;t work out</text>
  <text start="472.33" dur="3.69">it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that they&amp;#39;ve given up</text>
  <text start="474.01" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;ve never give up they still think</text>
  <text start="476.02" dur="5.43">in their minds they&amp;#39;re going to reach</text>
  <text start="478.36" dur="4.08">the goals that they set out with you</text>
  <text start="481.45" dur="2.82">know they were gonna have a one-world</text>
  <text start="482.44" dur="3.6">government the United States was gonna</text>
  <text start="484.27" dur="3.48">be a third world country they were gonna</text>
  <text start="486.04" dur="3.69">get us into war they were gonna do all</text>
  <text start="487.75" dur="4.77">that reduce the population they still</text>
  <text start="489.73" dur="5.82">believe all of this they they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="492.52" dur="6.42">headed in that direction now the</text>
  <text start="495.55" dur="5.7">documents that they want from all these</text>
  <text start="498.94" dur="3.99">different sanctuary cities would reveal</text>
  <text start="501.25" dur="3.63">whether law enforcement agencies in</text>
  <text start="502.93" dur="4.14">these jurisdictions are illegally</text>
  <text start="504.88" dur="4.38">withholding information from u.s.</text>
  <text start="507.07" dur="2.91">immigration authorities in violation of</text>
  <text start="509.26" dur="4.05">federal law</text>
  <text start="509.98" dur="4.8">most sanctuary cities have passed local</text>
  <text start="513.31" dur="3.87">laws meant to stop municipal law</text>
  <text start="514.78" dur="5.46">enforcement from sharing in arrestees</text>
  <text start="517.18" dur="6.27">immigration status with ice and we can</text>
  <text start="520.24" dur="5.46">see right now that Jeff Sessions from</text>
  <text start="523.45" dur="5.43">the Department of Justice they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="525.7" dur="5.58">looking to get these records and if they</text>
  <text start="528.88" dur="5.73">don&amp;#39;t get these records they will issue</text>
  <text start="531.28" dur="6.12">subpoenas for the information they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="534.61" dur="5.07">taking it to the next level they want to</text>
  <text start="537.4" dur="4.92">see what has been happening with these</text>
  <text start="539.68" dur="6.45">illegals and where they are what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="542.32" dur="5.91">on who they are and so on we see the NSA</text>
  <text start="546.13" dur="5.19">which is the National Security Agency</text>
  <text start="548.23" dur="7.95">they did something very interesting they</text>
  <text start="551.32" dur="7.71">have a website and on their website they</text>
  <text start="556.18" dur="6.54">have their mission statement and earlier</text>
  <text start="559.03" dur="9.42">this month the agency made a change it</text>
  <text start="562.72" dur="10.02">removed honesty has its top priority now</text>
  <text start="568.45" dur="7.23">since at least May 2016 the agency had</text>
  <text start="572.74" dur="5.58">featured honesty as the first of four</text>
  <text start="575.68" dur="5.88">core values listed on their website</text>
  <text start="578.32" dur="5.4">which is NSA gov and it was alongside</text>
  <text start="581.56" dur="5.46">respect for the law integrity and</text>
  <text start="583.72" dur="5.28">transparency the agency vowed</text>
  <text start="587.02" dur="4.62">the site to be truthful with each other</text>
  <text start="589" dur="6.72">and you can see this on the wayback</text>
  <text start="591.64" dur="9.08">machine the new version of the website</text>
  <text start="595.72" dur="8.91">page has been changed On January 12th</text>
  <text start="600.72" dur="5.95">they removed all of it and now the parts</text>
  <text start="604.63" dur="5.01">about honesty and the pledge to be</text>
  <text start="606.67" dur="6.05">truthful have been deleted the agency&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="609.64" dur="6.81">new top value is commitment to service</text>
  <text start="612.72" dur="6.88">which it says means excellence in the</text>
  <text start="616.45" dur="5.6">pursuit of our critical mission I mean</text>
  <text start="619.6" dur="4.71">they were never honest or trustworthy or</text>
  <text start="622.05" dur="4.24">transparent anyhow but it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="624.31" dur="6.24">interesting that they decided to change</text>
  <text start="626.29" dur="7.71">this why we see Trump is out in</text>
  <text start="630.55" dur="6.539">Switzerland he&amp;#39;s at the Swiss Alpine</text>
  <text start="634" dur="5.279">resort of Davos with about 3,000</text>
  <text start="637.089" dur="5.701">corporate executives and this is where</text>
  <text start="639.279" dur="7.081">all the very very wealthy the elite all</text>
  <text start="642.79" dur="5.85">meet and the elite pay around 55,000</text>
  <text start="646.36" dur="4.89">each to attend it is guarded by a small</text>
  <text start="648.64" dur="4.319">army of about 4,000 Swiss troops and a</text>
  <text start="651.25" dur="4.86">thousand police with no-fly zones</text>
  <text start="652.959" dur="5.511">imposed overhead and they talk about how</text>
  <text start="656.11" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re going to reshape the world and</text>
  <text start="658.47" dur="7.179">control us little people and of course</text>
  <text start="661.6" dur="7.02">Trump is now in the mix and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="665.649" dur="4.801">have to see how this all turns out now</text>
  <text start="668.62" dur="3.99">out in Afghanistan something very</text>
  <text start="670.45" dur="6.9">interesting came out with this new</text>
  <text start="672.61" dur="9.69">report and basically the Pentagon pretty</text>
  <text start="677.35" dur="7.44">much funded Afghan forces even though</text>
  <text start="682.3" dur="6">they knew they were sexually abusing</text>
  <text start="684.79" dur="6.859">children now a government watchdog has</text>
  <text start="688.3" dur="5.849">revealed that the Pentagon funded Afghan</text>
  <text start="691.649" dur="5.291">material eteri and security forces</text>
  <text start="694.149" dur="5.581">knowing that some of them were sexually</text>
  <text start="696.94" dur="5.76">abusing children the afghan military and</text>
  <text start="699.73" dur="5.16">police were also involved in at least 75</text>
  <text start="702.7" dur="6.06">gross human rights violations between</text>
  <text start="704.89" dur="6.99">2010 and 2016 including murder torture</text>
  <text start="708.76" dur="6.81">and the US government continued to fund</text>
  <text start="711.88" dur="6.36">them throughout this time and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="715.57" dur="4.62">seeing from this report is that they</text>
  <text start="718.24" dur="4.44">knew about this</text>
  <text start="720.19" dur="5.55">they knew that this was happening and</text>
  <text start="722.68" dur="5.01">they didn&amp;#39;t care now the sixty three</text>
  <text start="725.74" dur="4.29">page document parts of which were</text>
  <text start="727.69" dur="5.91">heavily redacted maintains that the</text>
  <text start="730.03" dur="5.64">Obama administration funded the Afghan</text>
  <text start="733.6" dur="3.39">Minh military which it knew was</text>
  <text start="735.67" dur="3.84">committing the human rights abuses</text>
  <text start="736.99" dur="4.89">including sexual assaults on children it</text>
  <text start="739.51" dur="4.47">was composed back in June of 2017 but</text>
  <text start="741.88" dur="6.23">was cleared for publication on January</text>
  <text start="743.98" dur="6.9">18th the Pentagon funded 12 Afghan units</text>
  <text start="748.11" dur="6.37">complicit in 14 human rights incidents</text>
  <text start="750.88" dur="5.55">in 2013 the sigar report said adding</text>
  <text start="754.48" dur="3.84">that nine additional units received US</text>
  <text start="756.43" dur="5.82">funding with some limitations on the use</text>
  <text start="758.32" dur="6.57">of money now a law in the u.s. called</text>
  <text start="762.25" dur="4.95">the leehi law forbids the US military</text>
  <text start="764.89" dur="4.74">and the State Department from funding</text>
  <text start="767.2" dur="5.55">foreign military or police units in</text>
  <text start="769.63" dur="4.41">cases where there is reliable evidence</text>
  <text start="772.75" dur="5.34">that the units have carried out gross</text>
  <text start="774.04" dur="5.61">violations of human rights now that</text>
  <text start="778.09" dur="5.19">didn&amp;#39;t stop them because what they did</text>
  <text start="779.65" dur="5.97">is they found a legal loophole in the</text>
  <text start="783.28" dur="5.7">Department of Defense Appropriations Act</text>
  <text start="785.62" dur="7.26">which allowed them to bypass that law</text>
  <text start="788.98" dur="7.5">and send the funds over because of</text>
  <text start="792.88" dur="5.55">national security concerns so we can see</text>
  <text start="796.48" dur="4.98">when the u.s. is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="798.43" dur="5.43">talking about human rights and torture</text>
  <text start="801.46" dur="5.61">and all this stuff it only matters if</text>
  <text start="803.86" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re trying to remove a elected</text>
  <text start="807.07" dur="4.5">leader in a country and replace that</text>
  <text start="809.11" dur="6.03">leader with a puppet government so if</text>
  <text start="811.57" dur="6.66">that leader like Assad or Saddam Hussein</text>
  <text start="815.14" dur="7.56">or you know any Qaddafi any of the</text>
  <text start="818.23" dur="7.14">others they use this tactic if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="822.7" dur="2.93">their puppet government they just ignore</text>
  <text start="825.37" dur="3.81">it</text>
  <text start="825.63" dur="6.76">so basically to double standard just</text>
  <text start="829.18" dur="4.92">like the al-qaeda the ISIS thing and</text>
  <text start="832.39" dur="4.56">terrorists and things like that if</text>
  <text start="834.1" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re trying to remove a government</text>
  <text start="836.95" dur="6.27">they use al-qaeda or the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="839.62" dur="5.37">to do so once the government is removed</text>
  <text start="843.22" dur="5.73">and a puppet government is put into</text>
  <text start="844.99" dur="6.63">place the Congress has a law that you</text>
  <text start="848.95" dur="4.31">can drone terrorists so anyone that is</text>
  <text start="851.62" dur="3.95">trying to remove that puppet</text>
  <text start="853.26" dur="4.17">government they call them al-qaeda so</text>
  <text start="855.57" dur="3.84">they can use drones on them even though</text>
  <text start="857.43" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re just the everyday person from</text>
  <text start="859.41" dur="2.85">that country trying to remove that</text>
  <text start="860.91" dur="3.63">puppet government they call them</text>
  <text start="862.26" dur="4.29">al-qaeda they&amp;#39;re terrorists and they use</text>
  <text start="864.54" dur="5.1">drones on them just like it what</text>
  <text start="866.55" dur="5.24">happened in Ukraine once the government</text>
  <text start="869.64" dur="5.88">was replaced with the puppet government</text>
  <text start="871.79" dur="5.5">the US the puppet government called</text>
  <text start="875.52" dur="3.93">anyone that stood against them</text>
  <text start="877.29" dur="4.89">terrorists and was that simple before</text>
  <text start="879.45" dur="4.86">they were part of the country living</text>
  <text start="882.18" dur="3.78">their lives and as soon as the puppet</text>
  <text start="884.31" dur="3.06">government was put into place they</text>
  <text start="885.96" dur="3.99">didn&amp;#39;t lie and the people didn&amp;#39;t like it</text>
  <text start="887.37" dur="6.99">that he became terrorists this is how</text>
  <text start="889.95" dur="8.3">the u.s. works now out in Syria we can</text>
  <text start="894.36" dur="8.91">see there&amp;#39;s a lot going on right now and</text>
  <text start="898.25" dur="8.71">Berta one is pushing his troops into the</text>
  <text start="903.27" dur="9.15">Kurd region and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="906.96" dur="8.48">that the YPG they are losing ground and</text>
  <text start="912.42" dur="4.98">the reason why I say this is that the</text>
  <text start="915.44" dur="4.93">intelligence services of the Kurdish</text>
  <text start="917.4" dur="5.52">people&amp;#39;s protection units has given the</text>
  <text start="920.37" dur="6.33">Islamic state prisoners under their</text>
  <text start="922.92" dur="8.37">control in Raqqa three choices stay in</text>
  <text start="926.7" dur="8.24">prison join their forces and the Syrian</text>
  <text start="931.29" dur="6.14">democratic forces and fight with us</text>
  <text start="934.94" dur="5.92">because what this really means is</text>
  <text start="937.43" dur="7.12">they&amp;#39;re running low on manpower and they</text>
  <text start="940.86" dur="6.74">need fighters to push on and we can see</text>
  <text start="944.55" dur="6">that the the campaign that turkey is</text>
  <text start="947.6" dur="5.53">waging right now is trying to throw it</text>
  <text start="950.55" dur="6.57">attempts to create a Kurdish corridor</text>
  <text start="953.13" dur="8.27">this is what the Cabal wants to do they</text>
  <text start="957.12" dur="7.35">want to create a Kurdish region and</text>
  <text start="961.4" dur="7.6">they&amp;#39;re pushing this very very hard</text>
  <text start="964.47" dur="7.17">right now and we can see that one of the</text>
  <text start="969" dur="6.72">tactics of Turkey Russia and the United</text>
  <text start="971.64" dur="6.3">States is to get the Cabal out of the</text>
  <text start="975.72" dur="5.52">Kurdish regions and we need to</text>
  <text start="977.94" dur="7.59">understand Syrian forces are not in this</text>
  <text start="981.24" dur="5.74">region the u.s. the Cabal controls this</text>
  <text start="985.53" dur="3.429">region with</text>
  <text start="986.98" dur="4.109">the Kurdish leaders they&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="988.959" dur="3.93">instructions from the Cabal and yes</text>
  <text start="991.089" dur="4.471">there is the Syrian democratic forces</text>
  <text start="992.889" dur="4.89">and other forces they have within there</text>
  <text start="995.56" dur="4.8">the Syrian army is not in there</text>
  <text start="997.779" dur="5.041">whatsoever so what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="1000.36" dur="5.669">is they&amp;#39;re trying to force the Cabal out</text>
  <text start="1002.82" dur="6.9">of this area and they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="1006.029" dur="7.17">into this area with the Syrian forces</text>
  <text start="1009.72" dur="6.359">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="1013.199" dur="5.64">Kurdish forces they denied an agreement</text>
  <text start="1016.079" dur="6.241">to allow Syrian troops into the Afrin</text>
  <text start="1018.839" dur="6.631">area and then later on they said no no</text>
  <text start="1022.32" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;re gonna let the Syrian army into the</text>
  <text start="1025.47" dur="4.92">area now once they start letting the</text>
  <text start="1027.66" dur="6.029">Syrian army into this area the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1030.39" dur="6">army Syria Assad is going to take</text>
  <text start="1033.689" dur="5.461">control of the Kurdish region and I</text>
  <text start="1036.39" dur="4.65">believe this is their plan ultimately to</text>
  <text start="1039.15" dur="3.84">for them to do this where they</text>
  <text start="1041.04" dur="4.5">continually push and push and push and</text>
  <text start="1042.99" dur="5.55">push the Cabal out the Kurdish people</text>
  <text start="1045.54" dur="5.73">allow the Syrian army in the Syrian army</text>
  <text start="1048.54" dur="5.82">takes control of this region it is a</text>
  <text start="1051.27" dur="5.909">little bit at a time which is now part</text>
  <text start="1054.36" dur="5.34">of Syria and it takes control away from</text>
  <text start="1057.179" dur="4.771">the Cabal and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="1059.7" dur="4.83">pretty much this is what is happening</text>
  <text start="1061.95" dur="5.19">here and Turkey once again they</text>
  <text start="1064.53" dur="5.13">announced that listen Turkey is ready to</text>
  <text start="1067.14" dur="7.44">discuss the current situation and future</text>
  <text start="1069.66" dur="8.34">of Syria if the u.s. drops support to</text>
  <text start="1074.58" dur="6.86">the Kurdish Democratic Union Party now</text>
  <text start="1078" dur="7.29">if Trump comes out and says we no longer</text>
  <text start="1081.44" dur="6.64">support them well for the Cabal it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1085.29" dur="6.66">game over and he already took away the</text>
  <text start="1088.08" dur="5.49">funding from the Kurdish army I mean</text>
  <text start="1091.95" dur="4.5">this was being funded all along why</text>
  <text start="1093.57" dur="5.91">Obama was in office Trump took away the</text>
  <text start="1096.45" dur="5.9">funding for the Kurdish army for the</text>
  <text start="1099.48" dur="6.99">moderate rebels and everything else and</text>
  <text start="1102.35" dur="9.73">all he has to do is come out and say the</text>
  <text start="1106.47" dur="10.53">u.s. no longer supports the Kurds which</text>
  <text start="1112.08" dur="7.44">means then Syria can come in and regain</text>
  <text start="1117" dur="4.23">control of this region which will then</text>
  <text start="1119.52" dur="4.47">force out the cob</text>
  <text start="1121.23" dur="5.85">and I think this is their tactic now the</text>
  <text start="1123.99" dur="5.669">other question is will this work because</text>
  <text start="1127.08" dur="4.559">we can see that the Cabal they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1129.659" dur="5.15">stubborn they have a goal they want a</text>
  <text start="1131.639" dur="6.27">sod gone they&amp;#39;re gonna push their agenda</text>
  <text start="1134.809" dur="6.25">we also need to remember and this was</text>
  <text start="1137.909" dur="6.99">about a year and a half ago or so there</text>
  <text start="1141.059" dur="7.171">was a tactical nuke that was snuck into</text>
  <text start="1144.899" dur="6.321">Aleppo and the whereabouts of where it</text>
  <text start="1148.23" dur="7.5">is right now we don&amp;#39;t know most likely</text>
  <text start="1151.22" dur="7.299">they have it most likely they might use</text>
  <text start="1155.73" dur="5.85">it and this could be a false flag</text>
  <text start="1158.519" dur="6.061">attempt or a major full false flag</text>
  <text start="1161.58" dur="4.86">attempt that qyn on has mentioned before</text>
  <text start="1164.58" dur="4.14">and he said that there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="1166.44" dur="4.32">many different attempts and about a day</text>
  <text start="1168.72" dur="5.73">or two ago we reported that there is a</text>
  <text start="1170.76" dur="6.649">chemical weapons attack in Syria and we</text>
  <text start="1174.45" dur="6.209">can see the US is out there stating that</text>
  <text start="1177.409" dur="5.321">this is Russia&amp;#39;s responsibility now</text>
  <text start="1180.659" dur="4.951">Tillerson was out there saying that</text>
  <text start="1182.73" dur="5.76">Russia is responsible for this but he</text>
  <text start="1185.61" dur="6.15">doesn&amp;#39;t really know who really did this</text>
  <text start="1188.49" dur="5.159">chemical weapons attack he has no clue</text>
  <text start="1191.76" dur="4.32">he doesn&amp;#39;t have any information he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1193.649" dur="4.831">just out there blurting things out to</text>
  <text start="1196.08" dur="5.88">let the Cabal and the corporate media</text>
  <text start="1198.48" dur="6.9">play on this and let them go off on this</text>
  <text start="1201.96" dur="5.579">tangent in the meantime what else is</text>
  <text start="1205.38" dur="5.13">happening here while the corporate media</text>
  <text start="1207.539" dur="6.831">is busy with you know Russia&amp;#39;s to blame</text>
  <text start="1210.51" dur="7.789">Russia and Syria they&amp;#39;re inviting the</text>
  <text start="1214.37" dur="7">OPCW investigators to districts</text>
  <text start="1218.299" dur="6.01">liberated from the militants what do</text>
  <text start="1221.37" dur="6.59">they have there they have abandoned</text>
  <text start="1224.309" dur="9.541">warehouses with chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="1227.96" dur="8.829">now these chemical weapons are from the</text>
  <text start="1233.85" dur="6.09">Islamic state al Qaeda and the moderate</text>
  <text start="1236.789" dur="7.23">rebels and Russia is trying to organize</text>
  <text start="1239.94" dur="7.01">this visit to Syria to examine the</text>
  <text start="1244.019" dur="5.431">chemical agents and they want a</text>
  <text start="1246.95" dur="5.709">fact-finding mission so they can go to</text>
  <text start="1249.45" dur="5.609">The Hague and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="1252.659" dur="5.461">that the US remember we reported on this</text>
  <text start="1255.059" dur="4.891">they already admitted that the terrorist</text>
  <text start="1258.12" dur="6.809">groups the moderate rebels they were</text>
  <text start="1259.95" dur="8.449">using chlorine gas and other weapons so</text>
  <text start="1264.929" dur="6.72">the whole thing is about to come down</text>
  <text start="1268.399" dur="6.13">around the Cabal now think about what is</text>
  <text start="1271.649" dur="4.89">happening right now and how desperate</text>
  <text start="1274.529" dur="5.49">they are going to get we talked about</text>
  <text start="1276.539" dur="4.081">Hawaii I believe that this really did</text>
  <text start="1280.019" dur="3.51">happen</text>
  <text start="1280.62" dur="6.629">that there was something headed towards</text>
  <text start="1283.529" dur="5.671">Hawaii and it was intercepted it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1287.249" dur="4.711">reach the target and that&amp;#39;s why the</text>
  <text start="1289.2" dur="4.799">missile alert actually went off that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1291.96" dur="3.809">why they did it and of course they had</text>
  <text start="1293.999" dur="2.971">to cover it up later on to say oh no it</text>
  <text start="1295.769" dur="2.221">was just a little accident someone push</text>
  <text start="1296.97" dur="1.819">the red button but that&amp;#39;s not how it</text>
  <text start="1297.99" dur="3.389">works</text>
  <text start="1298.789" dur="7.33">now I believe there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="1301.379" dur="7.441">major false flag coming very soon</text>
  <text start="1306.119" dur="5.01">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="1308.82" dur="4.02">there&amp;#39;s investigation going on with all</text>
  <text start="1311.129" dur="3.51">these individuals they&amp;#39;re getting ready</text>
  <text start="1312.84" dur="4.52">to release the memo now if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1314.639" dur="5.61">release the memo well this is going to</text>
  <text start="1317.36" dur="5.59">snowball into something even bigger than</text>
  <text start="1320.249" dur="4.92">if they release the memo and the reason</text>
  <text start="1322.95" dur="4.439">why I say that is because people are</text>
  <text start="1325.169" dur="4.83">then going to demand this memo be</text>
  <text start="1327.389" dur="4.441">released because then they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1329.999" dur="3.39">think the government is hiding something</text>
  <text start="1331.83" dur="3.87">because they came out and they said this</text>
  <text start="1333.389" dur="3.961">is so damaging this is unbelievable</text>
  <text start="1335.7" dur="3.359">people are gonna go to jail it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="1337.35" dur="3.809">shake the nation and if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1339.059" dur="4.651">release it people are gonna be like okay</text>
  <text start="1341.159" dur="5.37">the government can&amp;#39;t be trusted</text>
  <text start="1343.71" dur="6.87">they&amp;#39;re not open this is not an open</text>
  <text start="1346.529" dur="7.53">democracy this government that is there</text>
  <text start="1350.58" dur="7.74">now should be removed because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1354.059" dur="7.56">not giving the people the truth and we</text>
  <text start="1358.32" dur="7.62">can see that these individuals are so</text>
  <text start="1361.619" dur="7.621">nervous now so worried that they will</text>
