  <text start="58.69" dur="6.99">episode 1609 a and today&amp;#39;s date is July</text>
  <text start="62.65" dur="5.94">6 2018 and it&amp;#39;s out of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.68" dur="5.24">the Fed goes all out and removes more</text>
  <text start="68.59" dur="5.58">data to shape the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="70.92" dur="6.37">narrative let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="74.17" dur="4.8">collapse financial news now the central</text>
  <text start="77.29" dur="2.97">bankers they&amp;#39;ve done many many different</text>
  <text start="78.97" dur="4.02">things to get people away from</text>
  <text start="80.26" dur="6.51">cryptocurrency and what they&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="82.99" dur="5.79">is that countries now are looking at the</text>
  <text start="86.77" dur="4.56">blockchain looking at crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="88.78" dur="5.25">there&amp;#39;s many different corporations that</text>
  <text start="91.33" dur="5.91">are accepting Bitcoin to purchase their</text>
  <text start="94.03" dur="4.68">goods and the central banks they&amp;#39;re kind</text>
  <text start="97.24" dur="3.33">of stuck right now and this is why the</text>
  <text start="98.71" dur="5.55">head of the Bank of International</text>
  <text start="100.57" dur="7.44">Settlements biz came out and said the</text>
  <text start="104.26" dur="8.04">following crypto currency cannot assume</text>
  <text start="108.01" dur="9.57">the functions of money now general</text>
  <text start="112.3" dur="8.01">manager Augustine Carson&amp;#39;s caution young</text>
  <text start="117.58" dur="7.59">people against trying to create money</text>
  <text start="120.31" dur="6.839">and he was talking about Bitcoin went on</text>
  <text start="125.17" dur="4.32">to say that cryptocurrencies do not</text>
  <text start="127.149" dur="5.221">fulfill any of the three purposes of</text>
  <text start="129.49" dur="6.6">money they are neither a good means of</text>
  <text start="132.37" dur="5.52">payment nor a good unit of account nor</text>
  <text start="136.09" dur="3.6">are they suitable as a store of value</text>
  <text start="137.89" dur="4.08">they failed dramatically on each of</text>
  <text start="139.69" dur="4.29">these counts he says cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="141.97" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;re in a bubble it&amp;#39;s a gigantic</text>
  <text start="143.98" dur="7.32">Ponzi scheme well let&amp;#39;s look at the Fiat</text>
  <text start="148.06" dur="5.73">system I mean if we really want to talk</text>
  <text start="151.3" dur="5.49">about it it&amp;#39;s created out of thin air</text>
  <text start="153.79" dur="6.9">there&amp;#39;s really no store of value the</text>
  <text start="156.79" dur="6.99">only reason people use their currency is</text>
  <text start="160.69" dur="5.97">because they were able to weasel their</text>
  <text start="163.78" dur="5.19">way into governments especially the</text>
  <text start="166.66" dur="3.659">United States where they started the</text>
  <text start="168.97" dur="4.29">Federal Reserve and actually we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="170.319" dur="6.901">even know if the whole entire law was</text>
  <text start="173.26" dur="7.08">actually ratified and from that it</text>
  <text start="177.22" dur="5.13">blossomed into many other central banks</text>
  <text start="180.34" dur="4.5">and the Rothschilds have been doing this</text>
  <text start="182.35" dur="4">for a very long time and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="184.84" dur="6.19">getting out of this is</text>
  <text start="186.35" dur="7.11">that they are very worried about people</text>
  <text start="191.03" dur="6.26">and if you notice what he said people</text>
  <text start="193.46" dur="7.41">young people trying to create their own</text>
  <text start="197.29" dur="6.49">currency there we&amp;#39;re very worried about</text>
  <text start="200.87" dur="6.06">this because they realize if the people</text>
  <text start="203.78" dur="5.64">decide they don&amp;#39;t want to use their</text>
  <text start="206.93" dur="5.16">currency system anymore the the central</text>
  <text start="209.42" dur="5.04">bank currency system they know they will</text>
  <text start="212.09" dur="4.98">lose and this is why they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="214.46" dur="5.1">trying to demonize the crypto market the</text>
  <text start="217.07" dur="4.02">blockchain system but it&amp;#39;s not working</text>
  <text start="219.56" dur="2.82">people are looking at this and other</text>
  <text start="221.09" dur="3.39">countries are looking at this and</text>
  <text start="222.38" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re saying you know something it can</text>
  <text start="224.48" dur="4.77">be used for many different things and it</text>
  <text start="226.37" dur="5.58">can be used as a currency I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="229.25" dur="4.68">completely electronic it you can pay</text>
  <text start="231.95" dur="3.75">very easily with it there&amp;#39;s no problems</text>
  <text start="233.93" dur="4.08">now if we look at the US dollar for</text>
  <text start="235.7" dur="5.43">instance you know they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="238.01" dur="6.39">store value the US dollar has lost 98</text>
  <text start="241.13" dur="8.49">percent of its value since 1913 so how</text>
  <text start="244.4" dur="7.62">is that a store of value and what they</text>
  <text start="249.62" dur="3.87">do is they just continually keep you</text>
  <text start="252.02" dur="3.84">looking at the crypto currency telling</text>
  <text start="253.49" dur="3.72">you why it&amp;#39;s so bad and if you actually</text>
  <text start="255.86" dur="3.21">just take your eyes off of that for a</text>
  <text start="257.21" dur="4.52">second and look at the Fiat or Fayette</text>
  <text start="259.07" dur="5.82">system you can see that their system is</text>
  <text start="261.73" dur="5.65">absolutely awful and remember when you</text>
  <text start="264.89" dur="5.49">issue something and you create a crypto</text>
  <text start="267.38" dur="5.52">currency a coin there&amp;#39;s no interest</text>
  <text start="270.38" dur="5.31">attached compared to the central bank</text>
  <text start="272.9" dur="5.19">where when they create their currency by</text>
  <text start="275.69" dur="4.5">pushing a button they attach interest</text>
  <text start="278.09" dur="5.25">loan it to the government and the people</text>
  <text start="280.19" dur="7.8">then are enslaved to pay that back so</text>
  <text start="283.34" dur="6.06">that is a very big difference now here</text>
  <text start="287.99" dur="4.05">in the United States we see the payroll</text>
  <text start="289.4" dur="6.17">numbers the unemployment numbers they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="292.04" dur="5.64">come out and in June the US labor market</text>
  <text start="295.57" dur="4.6">continued to chug along there remember</text>
  <text start="297.68" dur="4.56">all these numbers are manipulated</text>
  <text start="300.17" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re not real they go back and revise</text>
  <text start="302.24" dur="4.17">and they leave people off of the count</text>
  <text start="304.52" dur="3.18">and we&amp;#39;ve been talking about this for a</text>
  <text start="306.41" dur="4.62">very long time and these calculations</text>
  <text start="307.7" dur="5.46">have not changed since the crisis</text>
  <text start="311.03" dur="3.72">actually they manipulated them even more</text>
  <text start="313.16" dur="3.09">to make it look like the economy&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="314.75" dur="3.78">a lot better than it really is and we</text>
  <text start="316.25" dur="3.9">see that the April payroll changes they</text>
  <text start="318.53" dur="3.26">were revised up from 150</text>
  <text start="320.15" dur="4.89">thousand two hundred seventy-five and</text>
  <text start="321.79" dur="4.93">with these revisions employment gains in</text>
  <text start="325.04" dur="3">April and May combined worth</text>
  <text start="326.72" dur="3.54">thirty-seven thousand more than</text>
  <text start="328.04" dur="4.62">previously reported and they had to do</text>
  <text start="330.26" dur="4.14">this because these entire systems</text>
  <text start="332.66" dur="3.42">breaking down now the unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="334.4" dur="4.71">went from three point eight to four</text>
  <text start="336.08" dur="4.77">point zero percent which really doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="339.11" dur="5.76">matter but the labor force participation</text>
  <text start="340.85" dur="5.61">rate it&amp;#39;s bouncing around between sixty</text>
  <text start="344.87" dur="4.77">two point seven to sixty two point nine</text>
  <text start="346.46" dur="7.17">percent and we are all the way back to</text>
  <text start="349.64" dur="7.35">nineteen seventy levels and we see right</text>
  <text start="353.63" dur="7.26">now that when people are not looking for</text>
  <text start="356.99" dur="6.09">a job they still want a job but they</text>
  <text start="360.89" dur="4.8">haven&amp;#39;t been on an interview they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="363.08" dur="4.26">just not counted as looking for a job</text>
  <text start="365.69" dur="3.18">and we can see how they could skew all</text>
  <text start="367.34" dur="5.61">these numbers now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="368.87" dur="7.04">interesting in the unemployment report</text>
  <text start="372.95" dur="7.23">from the BLS it says that part-time</text>
  <text start="375.91" dur="7.36">workers well they increased and</text>
  <text start="380.18" dur="4.47">full-time workers decline now we know</text>
  <text start="383.27" dur="3.39">there&amp;#39;s a lot of retail stores that are</text>
  <text start="384.65" dur="4.05">closing Toys R Us for instance just laid</text>
  <text start="386.66" dur="3.75">off around thirty three thousand people</text>
  <text start="388.7" dur="4.32">we know a lot other stores have been</text>
  <text start="390.41" dur="4.71">closing a lot of their stores and for</text>
  <text start="393.02" dur="4.83">them for us to hear the news that</text>
  <text start="395.12" dur="4.14">part-time work has gone up we know that</text>
  <text start="397.85" dur="3.84">this is fake phony and false and</text>
  <text start="399.26" dur="6.09">remember the people that are losing</text>
  <text start="401.69" dur="5.67">their jobs especially in retail if they</text>
  <text start="405.35" dur="4.56">aren&amp;#39;t working a certain number of hours</text>
  <text start="407.36" dur="5.22">and making a certain amount of money per</text>
  <text start="409.91" dur="5.84">week when they lose their job it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="412.58" dur="6.99">counted as a loss but if someone gets a</text>
  <text start="415.75" dur="5.89">job part-time making that you know</text>
  <text start="419.57" dur="5.52">amount of money working those hours it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="421.64" dur="7.56">counted as a full-time job or a part</text>
  <text start="425.09" dur="5.73">time job so we see how they manipulate</text>
  <text start="429.2" dur="4.07">all these numbers and we talked about</text>
  <text start="430.82" dur="5.34">vacancies yesterday we talked about</text>
  <text start="433.27" dur="5.56">unemployment we talked about GDP we</text>
  <text start="436.16" dur="5.72">talked about retail sales and statistics</text>
  <text start="438.83" dur="5.28">it&amp;#39;s very easily manipulated and</text>
  <text start="441.88" dur="4.54">basically what they do is they just</text>
  <text start="444.11" dur="5.97">manipulate all these numbers to fit</text>
  <text start="446.42" dur="5.43">their narrative we see out Manhattan the</text>
  <text start="450.08" dur="3.99">real estate bubble appears to have just</text>
  <text start="451.85" dur="4.17">burst 54% of</text>
  <text start="454.07" dur="5.25">sails in the second quarter close below</text>
  <text start="456.02" dur="5.58">asking price and the lowball offers</text>
  <text start="459.32" dur="5.13">coincide with a significant 17 percent</text>
  <text start="461.6" dur="5.7">decline in sales versus 2017 resulting</text>
  <text start="464.45" dur="4.08">in the lowest second quarter tally since</text>
  <text start="467.3" dur="4.68">2009</text>
  <text start="468.53" dur="5.43">now Manhattan home buyers are getting</text>
  <text start="471.98" dur="3.72">bolder these days demanding bargains or</text>
  <text start="473.96" dur="4.85">they&amp;#39;re just walking away from the deals</text>
  <text start="475.7" dur="5.76">in the market and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="478.81" dur="4.42">individuals are lowering their price or</text>
  <text start="481.46" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re taking their homes off the</text>
  <text start="483.23" dur="4.16">market because they don&amp;#39;t want to lower</text>
  <text start="484.94" dur="5.46">the price we saw this back prior to 2008</text>
  <text start="487.39" dur="3.46">where people put their houses up for</text>
  <text start="490.4" dur="1.95">sale</text>
  <text start="490.85" dur="2.76">they started out at a very high price</text>
  <text start="492.35" dur="2.97">and they started lowering them a little</text>
  <text start="493.61" dur="3.15">bit then lowered it a little bit and</text>
  <text start="495.32" dur="2.67">then eventually they said well it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="496.76" dur="3.03">even worth it I&amp;#39;m not going to sell it</text>
  <text start="497.99" dur="3.6">so they took it off the market and what</text>
  <text start="499.79" dur="3.51">happened then people were waiting for</text>
  <text start="501.59" dur="4.08">these prices to continually drop drop</text>
  <text start="503.3" dur="4.41">drop drop drop and many people never</text>
  <text start="505.67" dur="4.08">really even went out to purchase a house</text>
  <text start="507.71" dur="4.26">because they were losing jobs on the</text>
  <text start="509.75" dur="4.68">other end so we&amp;#39;re starting to see the</text>
  <text start="511.97" dur="4.74">same thing occur once again and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="514.43" dur="5.669">just beginning but we see out in Canada</text>
  <text start="516.71" dur="5.85">Australia Europe those bubbles are</text>
  <text start="520.099" dur="4.891">bursting right now we see Russian Prime</text>
  <text start="522.56" dur="4.43">Minister well he assigned a decree this</text>
  <text start="524.99" dur="5.52">morning imposing higher tariffs on US</text>
  <text start="526.99" dur="6.1">products in retaliation for US duties on</text>
  <text start="530.51" dur="4.23">metal imports and really what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="533.09" dur="5.4">happening right now is that we have</text>
  <text start="534.74" dur="6.6">China we have Russia we have the US with</text>
  <text start="538.49" dur="4.89">this trade war going on and it&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="541.34" dur="3.15">typical trade war that we might think of</text>
  <text start="543.38" dur="2.97">because I think what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="544.49" dur="5.13">do here is they&amp;#39;re coming together</text>
  <text start="546.35" dur="7.32">working together to bring down the</text>
  <text start="549.62" dur="5.79">entire central bank system now remember</text>
  <text start="553.67" dur="3.51">the central bank system is made up many</text>
  <text start="555.41" dur="3.33">different pieces we have the World Trade</text>
  <text start="557.18" dur="4.89">Organization which we know that Trump is</text>
  <text start="558.74" dur="5.31">going after we have NAFTA TPP has</text>
  <text start="562.07" dur="4.8">already been struck down we have the</text>
  <text start="564.05" dur="6.69">central banking system that issues the</text>
  <text start="566.87" dur="6.09">currency and they&amp;#39;re trying to take the</text>
  <text start="570.74" dur="4.29">global economy and Russia already</text>
  <text start="572.96" dur="3.96">understands that the global economy is</text>
  <text start="575.03" dur="3.6">breaking down China already understands</text>
  <text start="576.92" dur="3.84">the global economies breaking down and</text>
  <text start="578.63" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;re trying to rip this whole thing</text>
  <text start="580.76" dur="6.57">apart and we see right now that Russia</text>
  <text start="584.72" dur="3.059">well how much longer are they going to</text>
  <text start="587.33" dur="2.489">stay in</text>
  <text start="587.779" dur="3.48">World Trade Organization how much longer</text>
  <text start="589.819" dur="4.02">is trying to gonna stay in the World</text>
  <text start="591.259" dur="4.531">Trade Organization and how much longer</text>
  <text start="593.839" dur="3.48">is the u.s. going to stay in the World</text>
  <text start="595.79" dur="3.63">Trade Organization I think they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="597.319" dur="5.671">working together to bring the system</text>
  <text start="599.42" dur="5.039">down and like I said each side is going</text>
  <text start="602.99" dur="3.449">to try to control a narrative we have</text>
  <text start="604.459" dur="4.021">the central bank&amp;#39;s on one side and those</text>
  <text start="606.439" dur="4.08">that who are opposed to the central bank</text>
  <text start="608.48" dur="3.719">um we know that Russia has taken over</text>
  <text start="610.519" dur="4.591">their private western central bank</text>
  <text start="612.199" dur="6">system and they call the shots not the</text>
  <text start="615.11" dur="6.659">Rothschilds we see right now that the</text>
  <text start="618.199" dur="6.3">yield curve is flattening and the Fed</text>
  <text start="621.769" dur="6.721">revealed that instead of thinking about</text>
  <text start="624.499" dur="6.721">backing off rate hikes it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="628.49" dur="4.92">replace the yield curve and I&amp;#39;ll explain</text>
  <text start="631.22" dur="5.669">what that means in a minute in the</text>
  <text start="633.41" dur="5.369">minutes of the F of FOMC meeting on June</text>
  <text start="636.889" dur="5.75">12th and 13th which was released</text>
  <text start="638.779" dur="6.54">yesterday there was a doozy in there</text>
  <text start="642.639" dur="4.961">obscured somewhat by the dynamics of the</text>
  <text start="645.319" dur="3.901">rate hike plus the indication that there</text>
  <text start="647.6" dur="4.109">would be two more rate hikes this year</text>
  <text start="649.22" dur="4.559">for a total of four up from three at the</text>
  <text start="651.709" dur="4.141">prior meeting with more hikes to come in</text>
  <text start="653.779" dur="4.471">2019 and there were other changes that</text>
  <text start="655.85" dur="5.279">were all mixed in with this but the big</text>
  <text start="658.25" dur="6.12">doozy in there in the minutes was about</text>
  <text start="661.129" dur="6.091">the flattening yield curve now the yield</text>
  <text start="664.37" dur="4.589">curve is formed by Treasury yields of</text>

  <text start="683.24" dur="6.51">this was the financial crisis so this</text>
  <text start="686.87" dur="5.909">has become a popular recession indicator</text>
  <text start="689.75" dur="5.79">and it keeps popping up and the Fed</text>
  <text start="692.779" dur="5.461">governors are looking at this and they</text>
  <text start="695.54" dur="4.799">don&amp;#39;t like it they don&amp;#39;t like anything</text>
  <text start="698.24" dur="6.149">indicating that what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="700.339" dur="8.48">bringing us into a recession so they</text>
  <text start="704.389" dur="6.781">decided to do something very interesting</text>
  <text start="708.819" dur="3.791">instead of backing off you know their</text>
  <text start="711.17" dur="4.109">rate hikes and doing all this other</text>
  <text start="712.61" dur="6.12">stuff they&amp;#39;re gonna throw out the</text>
  <text start="715.279" dur="6.1">flattening yield curve they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="718.73" dur="7.029">that the yield curve</text>
  <text start="721.379" dur="6.54">is an unreliable recession indicator in</text>

  <text start="727.919" dur="5.58">sheet nine years of near zero interest</text>
  <text start="730.709" dur="5.761">rate policy and other factors might be</text>
  <text start="733.499" dur="5.04">distorting investors thinking and this</text>
  <text start="736.47" dur="4.319">distorted thinking causes investors to</text>
  <text start="738.539" dur="4.29">pile into long-term Treasuries at these</text>
  <text start="740.789" dur="6.9">low yields and then push down the yields</text>
  <text start="742.829" dur="7.08">further so the yield curve is distorted</text>
  <text start="747.689" dur="3.75">we can&amp;#39;t look at that it&amp;#39;s not giving us</text>
  <text start="749.909" dur="3.9">the real information know what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="751.439" dur="5.67">really saying is we need to cover up</text>

  <text start="757.109" dur="6.09">people this data and have it you know be</text>
  <text start="760.979" dur="5.34">reported on so what are we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="763.199" dur="5.76">right now for the central bank to shape</text>
  <text start="766.319" dur="3.87">the narrative of this next collapse well</text>
  <text start="768.959" dur="3.87">we have the Wall Street Journal saying</text>
  <text start="770.189" dur="4.47">that recession is coming in 2020 we had</text>
  <text start="772.829" dur="4.141">the New York Post the economy is not</text>
  <text start="774.659" dur="5.43">doing as great as Trump things we had</text>
  <text start="776.97" dur="4.829">the Business Insider magazine saying</text>

  <text start="785.549" dur="4.83">the Fred balance sheet data so you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="787.919" dur="5.51">see that and now they&amp;#39;re throwing out</text>
  <text start="790.379" dur="6.18">the inverted yield curve because it is</text>
  <text start="793.429" dur="5.95">distorted so think about this for a</text>

  <text start="803.639" dur="3.45">lot more of this and I didn&amp;#39;t think it</text>
  <text start="805.619" dur="3.18">was going to happen this quickly but it</text>
  <text start="807.089" dur="4.05">looks like they are really covering</text>
  <text start="808.799" dur="3.99">their tracks right now and you can see</text>
  <text start="811.139" dur="4.56">that they&amp;#39;re getting ready and prepared</text>
  <text start="812.789" dur="5.82">to bring this system down and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="815.699" dur="5.31">want to have any data or information to</text>
  <text start="818.609" dur="4.47">show that they were the ones that did</text>
  <text start="821.009" dur="2.85">this why because they&amp;#39;re gonna point the</text>
  <text start="823.079" dur="3.9">finger they&amp;#39;re gonna point the finger</text>
  <text start="823.859" dur="6.361">someplace else and in the New York Post</text>
  <text start="826.979" dur="4.17">and in The Business Insider magazine and</text>
  <text start="830.22" dur="2.609">we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot of these store</text>
  <text start="831.149" dur="4.08">more story more of these stories come</text>
  <text start="832.829" dur="4.68">out they&amp;#39;re going to start naming that</text>
  <text start="835.229" dur="3.991">Trump is the problem and you notice with</text>
  <text start="837.509" dur="4.08">the Wall Street Journal they&amp;#39;re planning</text>
  <text start="839.22" dur="5.279">on doing this before the 2020 elections</text>
  <text start="841.589" dur="4.79">it&amp;#39;s already planned right now because</text>
  <text start="844.499" dur="4.44">they are stuck they know the system</text>
  <text start="846.379" dur="4.45">cannot continue on like this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="848.939" dur="3.3">very nervous and afraid that Trump of</text>
  <text start="850.829" dur="3.631">the Patriots are going to bring down the</text>
  <text start="852.239" dur="4.471">system and control the narrative</text>
  <text start="854.46" dur="5.1">so we&amp;#39;re headed for this major</text>
  <text start="856.71" dur="5.52">transition and they&amp;#39;ve already started</text>
  <text start="859.56" dur="3.839">the process now we talked about how they</text>
  <text start="862.23" dur="3.12">were raising the interest rates and we</text>
  <text start="863.399" dur="4.081">talked about what happened last time</text>
  <text start="865.35" dur="5.46">when we hit the Great Recession in 2008</text>
  <text start="867.48" dur="5.4">they slowly raised the interest rates</text>
  <text start="870.81" dur="3.839">looks like a little step going up and</text>
  <text start="872.88" dur="3.72">when it hit a certain point everything</text>
  <text start="874.649" dur="5.19">started to break apart those rates fell</text>
  <text start="876.6" dur="5.04">like an elevator you know dropping from</text>
  <text start="879.839" dur="4.921">the top of the building with no breaks I</text>
  <text start="881.64" dur="5.04">went straight down and what we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="884.76" dur="4.26">to see once again once we hit a certain</text>
  <text start="886.68" dur="3.63">point and everything really starts to</text>
  <text start="889.02" dur="2.819">fall apart we&amp;#39;re already starting seeing</text>
  <text start="890.31" dur="3.66">that we&amp;#39;re already starting to see signs</text>
  <text start="891.839" dur="4.741">of this where the real estate market is</text>
  <text start="893.97" dur="5.1">starting to shake apart we see Manhattan</text>
  <text start="896.58" dur="5.43">we see San Francisco we see Canada we</text>
  <text start="899.07" dur="5.16">see Australia we see Europe they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="902.01" dur="3.75">gonna take this to the next level and</text>
  <text start="904.23" dur="3.84">we&amp;#39;re gonna see things really start to</text>
  <text start="905.76" dur="3.99">fall apart I mean we see the consume the</text>
  <text start="908.07" dur="4.44">everyday consumer they can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="909.75" dur="5.64">high-paying jobs people are losing their</text>
  <text start="912.51" dur="4.86">part-time jobs people aren&amp;#39;t making as</text>
  <text start="915.39" dur="4.35">much as they used to interest rates are</text>
  <text start="917.37" dur="4.159">still very very low so people really</text>
  <text start="919.74" dur="4.74">aren&amp;#39;t earning interest on their savings</text>
  <text start="921.529" dur="4.271">that in the savings accounts and we know</text>
  <text start="924.48" dur="3.63">that the savings rate is continually</text>
  <text start="925.8" dur="4.44">dropping the only thing that&amp;#39;s going up</text>
  <text start="928.11" dur="5.04">right now is the stock market because</text>
  <text start="930.24" dur="5.16">they have control over this but we see</text>
  <text start="933.15" dur="4.41">that everything else around what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="935.4" dur="3.96">been a minute manipulating is completely</text>
  <text start="937.56" dur="3.57">falling apart right now and they</text>
  <text start="939.36" dur="4.02">understand that they don&amp;#39;t have that</text>
  <text start="941.13" dur="4.86">much time they need to start creating</text>
  <text start="943.38" dur="4.5">the narrative now so when people look</text>
  <text start="945.99" dur="4.02">back saying oh yes look we saw this oh</text>
  <text start="947.88" dur="4.35">yes we heard this oh yes this is where</text>
  <text start="950.01" dur="6.74">it&amp;#39;s leading us that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="952.23" dur="7.38">it right now to gain the advantage of</text>
  <text start="956.75" dur="5.38">controlling this system coming down and</text>
  <text start="959.61" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re not the ones to blame this is</text>
  <text start="962.13" dur="4.77">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do so we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="964.44" dur="4.11">see this battle continue on and I</text>
