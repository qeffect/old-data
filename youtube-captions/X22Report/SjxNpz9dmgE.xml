  <text start="49.699" dur="6.061">political and geopolitical news now out</text>
  <text start="52.85" dur="5.52">in Afghanistan we understand the United</text>
  <text start="55.76" dur="3.96">States government central bankers we</text>
  <text start="58.37" dur="3.649">mentioned this many many times before</text>
  <text start="59.72" dur="5.369">and they will never ever leave</text>

  <text start="81.95" dur="5.34">now there&amp;#39;s a report coming out saying</text>
  <text start="84.92" dur="5.4">that nearly two-thirds or about 200,000</text>
  <text start="87.29" dur="5.54">of the number of us funded afghan</text>

  <text start="95.659" dur="5.7">been deemed non-existent ghost service</text>
  <text start="99.2" dur="5">members who are supposed to be backing</text>
  <text start="101.359" dur="6.811">american troops on the battlefield and</text>
  <text start="104.2" dur="6.75">this came from a watchdog and it was a</text>
  <text start="108.17" dur="7.159">letter that was sent to the Pentagon and</text>
  <text start="110.95" dur="9.909">basically we can see where all of this</text>
  <text start="115.329" dur="7.271">money is being spent and most of what</text>
  <text start="120.859" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re spending it on doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="122.6" dur="4.5">exist the schools and the structures</text>

  <text start="128.81" dur="6.149">training that are supposed to be backing</text>
  <text start="131.03" dur="9.33">the US forces with all of it is a lie</text>
  <text start="134.959" dur="7.171">and we can see right now that the only</text>
  <text start="140.36" dur="4.22">reason the United States government</text>
  <text start="142.13" dur="9.26">central bankers were even in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="144.58" dur="10.45">was to garrison the country create a</text>
  <text start="151.39" dur="7.69">place where they can grow the poppies to</text>
  <text start="155.03" dur="6.51">pay for covert operations through a</text>
  <text start="159.08" dur="4.4">process of selling drugs across the</text>
  <text start="161.54" dur="5.009">globe</text>
  <text start="163.48" dur="4.75">making sure that China and Russia stay</text>
  <text start="166.549" dur="3.991">out of this area even though they are</text>
  <text start="168.23" dur="5.729">they&amp;#39;re trying to help the Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="170.54" dur="5.94">government and the people inside</text>
  <text start="173.959" dur="7.321">Afghanistan they want the United States</text>
  <text start="176.48" dur="9.569">out of their country just like Libya</text>
  <text start="181.28" dur="9.78">just like Yemen just like a rack just</text>
  <text start="186.049" dur="7.291">like Syria just like Ukraine but we can</text>
  <text start="191.06" dur="5.73">see right now the US government central</text>
  <text start="193.34" dur="7.619">bankers they need to maintain control of</text>
  <text start="196.79" dur="8.19">this entire area to keep their system</text>
  <text start="200.959" dur="8.011">alive with the petro dollar and as we</text>
  <text start="204.98" dur="8.759">can see the petro dollar it is dying a</text>
  <text start="208.97" dur="6.21">slow death and we see right now that the</text>
  <text start="213.739" dur="4.95">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="215.18" dur="6.679">they are continually placing troops all</text>
  <text start="218.689" dur="7.261">around the globe right now in Norway</text>
  <text start="221.859" dur="8.111">it&amp;#39;s looking that the u.s. might get</text>
  <text start="225.95" dur="6.119">their wish because Norway is going to</text>
  <text start="229.97" dur="4.169">allow American marines to be placed on</text>
  <text start="232.069" dur="4.771">its soil and this is coming from the</text>
  <text start="234.139" dur="4.53">Nordic nation&amp;#39;s defense ministry the</text>
  <text start="236.84" dur="3.239">plans currently being discussed could</text>
  <text start="238.669" dur="4.081">reportedly see the deployment of about</text>
  <text start="240.079" dur="3.931">three hundred US Marines there of course</text>
  <text start="242.75" dur="5.099">they&amp;#39;re going to be on a rotational</text>
  <text start="244.01" dur="8.009">basis and that could mean every three</text>
  <text start="247.849" dur="7.2">years the troops rotate every six months</text>
  <text start="252.019" dur="5.671">whatever time span they place on this so</text>
  <text start="255.049" dur="4.321">it looks like they&amp;#39;re only temporary the</text>
  <text start="257.69" dur="3.75">deployment will reportedly take place</text>
  <text start="259.37" dur="4.26">about six hundred miles from the border</text>
  <text start="261.44" dur="5.43">of Russia which is in the Arctic Circle</text>
  <text start="263.63" dur="4.92">and spans about 125 miles and we can see</text>
  <text start="266.87" dur="4.729">right now the US government central</text>
  <text start="268.55" dur="7.26">bankers have been strategically placing</text>
  <text start="271.599" dur="9.25">military assets troops all around Russia</text>
  <text start="275.81" dur="8.22">and all around China we see right now a</text>
  <text start="280.849" dur="6.721">UN watchdog has slammed Saudi Arabia for</text>
  <text start="284.03" dur="7.499">subjecting minors as young as 15 to</text>
  <text start="287.57" dur="7.529">stoning flogging amputation and even</text>
  <text start="291.529" dur="5.331">execution and this is contrary to the</text>
  <text start="295.099" dur="5.6">children rights convention</text>
  <text start="296.86" dur="6.72">but Saudi Arabia is saying you know this</text>
  <text start="300.699" dur="6.84">is how we do it the Sharia laws are</text>
  <text start="303.58" dur="8.72">above any law and treaties and right now</text>
  <text start="307.539" dur="4.761">the Committee on the Rights of the Child</text>
  <text start="312.449" dur="6.641">through the UN is telling Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="316.15" dur="5.759">you need to stop the torturing you need</text>
  <text start="319.09" dur="4.979">to stop this right now now it&amp;#39;s Saudi</text>
  <text start="321.909" dur="3.901">Arabia going to do this most likely not</text>
  <text start="324.069" dur="4.921">we see the United States government</text>
  <text start="325.81" dur="7.53">central bankers they are getting into</text>
  <text start="328.99" dur="7.109">the fight in Yemen today the report came</text>
  <text start="333.34" dur="5.28">out that two missiles were filed from</text>
  <text start="336.099" dur="5.461">the Hootie&amp;#39;s from the rebel-held</text>
  <text start="338.62" dur="5.849">territory in Yemen and landed near an</text>
  <text start="341.56" dur="5.069">American destroyer in the Red Sea now</text>
  <text start="344.469" dur="3.66">the ship that was out there is the USS</text>
  <text start="346.629" dur="4.5">Mason and arleigh burke-class</text>
  <text start="348.129" dur="6.931">guided-missile destroyer and we know how</text>
  <text start="351.129" dur="6.6">this game is played they send their</text>
  <text start="355.06" dur="6.99">operatives into the area they fire a</text>
  <text start="357.729" dur="9.15">missile it&amp;#39;s fired in a location where</text>
  <text start="362.05" dur="7.47">it&amp;#39;s very far away from ship or troops</text>
  <text start="366.879" dur="5.731">or anything like that and they use this</text>
  <text start="369.52" dur="6.06">to say we were just fired upon we were</text>
  <text start="372.61" dur="5.669">just attacked and now we need to go into</text>
  <text start="375.58" dur="5.79">Yemen now why would they do this at this</text>
  <text start="378.279" dur="7.23">point because what we&amp;#39;re seeing in Yemen</text>
  <text start="381.37" dur="6.449">is at the Saudi Arabia proxy Force which</text>
  <text start="385.509" dur="5.041">is the United States is using Saudi</text>
  <text start="387.819" dur="5.611">Arabia to fight their battle inside of</text>
  <text start="390.55" dur="5.88">Yemen Saudi Arabia&amp;#39;s using paid</text>
  <text start="393.43" dur="5.28">mercenaries to do this and we see it is</text>
  <text start="396.43" dur="4.139">not going well right now it&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="398.71" dur="4.35">much much longer than they anticipated</text>
  <text start="400.569" dur="5.041">and the United States government central</text>
  <text start="403.06" dur="4.59">bankers realize that they need to get</text>
  <text start="405.61" dur="4.169">back into the Middle East one way or</text>
  <text start="407.65" dur="4.289">another and they&amp;#39;re already starting the</text>
  <text start="409.779" dur="5.13">propaganda that they are being attacked</text>
  <text start="411.939" dur="4.47">now this is probably phase one we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="414.909" dur="3.271">probably see a little bit more of this</text>
  <text start="416.409" dur="3.81">and then all of a sudden the United</text>
  <text start="418.18" dur="3.18">States will then go into Yemen and</text>
  <text start="420.219" dur="2.25">they&amp;#39;re going to do this to the rest of</text>
  <text start="421.36" dur="3.72">the countries I mean look they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="422.469" dur="4.711">already in Libya bombing Libya trying to</text>
  <text start="425.08" dur="3.869">take control of that country they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="427.18" dur="3.42">going to try in Yemen because Saudi</text>
  <text start="428.949" dur="2.851">Arabia is not doing the job</text>
  <text start="430.6" dur="4.13">they&amp;#39;re going to have to get back into</text>
  <text start="431.8" dur="5.19">Lebanon they&amp;#39;re already mounting</text>
  <text start="434.73" dur="3.79">thousands upon thousands of troops in</text>
  <text start="436.99" dur="3.18">Iraq because they&amp;#39;re not calling you</text>
  <text start="438.52" dur="2.73">after the Islamic state they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="440.17" dur="3.78">after the people because the people</text>
  <text start="441.25" dur="8.22">there are rising up and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="443.95" dur="7.11">the US government in their country the</text>
  <text start="449.47" dur="3.84">people want their country back they</text>
  <text start="451.06" dur="3.99">don&amp;#39;t want the central bank&amp;#39;s and we can</text>
  <text start="453.31" dur="4.47">see right now the United States is</text>
  <text start="455.05" dur="4.32">making their first move to take control</text>
  <text start="457.78" dur="3.87">of the Middle East once again because</text>
  <text start="459.37" dur="5.58">the petro dollar is under threat right</text>
  <text start="461.65" dur="5.76">now and we can see from what is</text>
  <text start="464.95" dur="5.46">happening there everything is starting</text>
  <text start="467.41" dur="5.46">to escalate gather who these are out</text>
  <text start="470.41" dur="6.15">there they&amp;#39;re saying we never fired any</text>
  <text start="472.87" dur="8.22">missiles towards the US warship the</text>
  <text start="476.56" dur="7.29">question is what would be the motive for</text>
  <text start="481.09" dur="5.79">the Hootie&amp;#39;s to do this let&amp;#39;s say they</text>
  <text start="483.85" dur="6.66">fired a missile allegedly coming from</text>
  <text start="486.88" dur="6.09">the rebel-held area they fired it at a</text>
  <text start="490.51" dur="6.03">u.s. ship which will allow the u.s. to</text>
  <text start="492.97" dur="6.45">come in to Yemen to fight the Hootie&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="496.54" dur="5.64">does that make any sense no they</text>
  <text start="499.42" dur="4.77">wouldn&amp;#39;t do this because that wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="502.18" dur="4.2">be part of their agenda their agenda is</text>
  <text start="504.19" dur="6.18">to take back their country their agenda</text>
  <text start="506.38" dur="6.36">is to remove Saudi Arabia their agenda</text>
  <text start="510.37" dur="5.58">is to form a government which they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="512.74" dur="6.33">trying to do now the US on the other</text>
  <text start="515.95" dur="5.1">hand doesn&amp;#39;t want the Hootie&amp;#39;s to form a</text>
  <text start="519.07" dur="5.159">government which they&amp;#39;re getting very</text>
  <text start="521.05" dur="7.77">close in doing they already have people</text>
  <text start="524.229" dur="7.441">in place and they are in the process of</text>
  <text start="528.82" dur="6.06">forming a government now the United</text>
  <text start="531.67" dur="5.37">States needs to stop this Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="534.88" dur="3.75">is not doing the job so we can see right</text>
  <text start="537.04" dur="4.83">now the United States is making their</text>
  <text start="538.63" dur="5.61">move to get into Yemen because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="541.87" dur="5.76">already in a Libya we&amp;#39;re already in Iraq</text>
  <text start="544.24" dur="6.75">and we&amp;#39;re in Syria trying to keep this</text>
  <text start="547.63" dur="5.85">petro dollar system alive and this is</text>
  <text start="550.99" dur="4.26">the central banker system this has</text>
  <text start="553.48" dur="3.87">nothing to do with energy in the Middle</text>
  <text start="555.25" dur="5.22">East has nothing to do about being</text>
  <text start="557.35" dur="7.17">self-sufficient this is about keeping</text>
  <text start="560.47" dur="6.57">the central bankers dollar alive</text>
  <text start="564.52" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re doing all this this</text>
  <text start="567.04" dur="5.78">is why they&amp;#39;re starting a war over their</text>
  <text start="569.71" dur="6.32">paper and ink we see Russia and Turkey</text>
  <text start="572.82" dur="6.64">they just signed the Turkish stream gas</text>
  <text start="576.03" dur="6.31">pipeline deal and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="579.46" dur="5.49">the pipeline would allow Russia to</text>
  <text start="582.34" dur="5.1">supply natural gas and will be delivered</text>
  <text start="584.95" dur="5.76">directly to Turkey via the russian black</text>
  <text start="587.44" dur="5.46">sea and on to greece and then up into</text>
  <text start="590.71" dur="3.96">europe now of course united states</text>
  <text start="592.9" dur="7.05">government central bankers they do not</text>
  <text start="594.67" dur="7.89">want this because then Russia they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="599.95" dur="5.01">corner the market and they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="602.56" dur="3.42">supplying the gas to Europe so we can</text>
  <text start="604.96" dur="2.82">see right now the United States</text>
  <text start="605.98" dur="5.4">government central bankers they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="607.78" dur="6">want this to happen and we see right now</text>
  <text start="611.38" dur="5.97">that the u.s. they&amp;#39;re doing whatever</text>
  <text start="613.78" dur="6.2">they possibly can in Syria to start this</text>
  <text start="617.35" dur="5.82">war they broke off contact with Russia</text>
  <text start="619.98" dur="6.25">we can see right now there&amp;#39;s nothing on</text>
  <text start="623.17" dur="5.37">the table Russia is saying listen we</text>
  <text start="626.23" dur="4.44">will work with the United States let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="628.54" dur="5.46">talk let&amp;#39;s start talking about peace</text>

  <text start="637.51" dur="6.06">is building a permanent air base there</text>
  <text start="640.27" dur="6.24">Russia is building a permanent naval</text>
  <text start="643.57" dur="5.4">base in Tartus and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="646.51" dur="6.75">they&amp;#39;re already planning on staying</text>
  <text start="648.97" dur="6.87">there China already has a warship headed</text>
  <text start="653.26" dur="5.76">towards this area and we can see right</text>
  <text start="655.84" dur="6.84">now that Russia and China they are</text>
  <text start="659.02" dur="6.9">quickly forming a strategy of synergy in</text>
  <text start="662.68" dur="6.57">Syria and this is going to be a problem</text>
  <text start="665.92" dur="5.85">for the United States government central</text>
  <text start="669.25" dur="4.77">bankers because they&amp;#39;re really backed in</text>
  <text start="671.77" dur="4.56">a corner right now this has nothing to</text>
  <text start="674.02" dur="5.04">do with humanitarian aid this has</text>
  <text start="676.33" dur="5.61">nothing to do with Aleppo falling this</text>
  <text start="679.06" dur="7.68">has to do with the United States losing</text>
  <text start="681.94" dur="6.96">their terrorist groups losing what they</text>
  <text start="686.74" dur="6.24">really wanted and that was to remove</text>
  <text start="688.9" dur="7.97">Assad to build their gas pipeline to put</text>
  <text start="692.98" dur="5.07">in a central bank then to go into Iran</text>
  <text start="696.87" dur="4.089">that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="698.05" dur="4.71">what this is all about and we can see</text>
  <text start="700.959" dur="5.521">right now they&amp;#39;re using a lot of</text>
  <text start="702.76" dur="7.56">propaganda trying to convince the world</text>
  <text start="706.48" dur="6.69">that Russia and Syria are being barbaric</text>
  <text start="710.32" dur="6.389">in Aleppo but what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="713.17" dur="6.51">that the UN envoy to Syria he offered a</text>
  <text start="716.709" dur="7.431">direct appeal to the terrorist</text>
  <text start="719.68" dur="8.64">organization al-nusrah al Qaeda al sham</text>
  <text start="724.14" dur="8.49">saying listen we will escort you out of</text>
  <text start="728.32" dur="10.05">Aleppo with your weapons too it&amp;#39;d lib if</text>
  <text start="732.63" dur="9.19">we can just have you removed the people</text>
  <text start="738.37" dur="6.42">then can be brought humanitarian aid the</text>
  <text start="741.82" dur="5.37">people then can live their lives in</text>
  <text start="744.79" dur="6.53">Aleppo there&amp;#39;ll be no more bombing in</text>
  <text start="747.19" dur="9.089">this area and everything will be fine</text>
  <text start="751.32" dur="7.99">but as the terrorists are in there they</text>
  <text start="756.279" dur="4.62">are causing a problem and they tried to</text>
  <text start="759.31" dur="4.2">make this deal now what is the United</text>
  <text start="760.899" dur="5.731">States do at this point because if the</text>
  <text start="763.51" dur="5.55">terrorists actually leave Aleppo Aleppo</text>
  <text start="766.63" dur="3.78">then belongs to Syria and Russia and</text>
  <text start="769.06" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re not even saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="770.41" dur="5.58">going to shoot at them they&amp;#39;re saying we</text>
  <text start="773.14" dur="8.58">will let you leave with your weapons and</text>
  <text start="775.99" dur="6.99">go someplace else and this again is a</text>
  <text start="781.72" dur="4.65">problem for the United States government</text>
  <text start="782.98" dur="6.09">central bankers because what do they say</text>
  <text start="786.37" dur="4.38">no we want our terrorists to say because</text>
  <text start="789.07" dur="4.889">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="790.75" dur="6.66">terrorists are keeping the people in</text>
  <text start="793.959" dur="6.331">Aleppo hostage by staying there remember</text>
  <text start="797.41" dur="4.289">these are terrorists they&amp;#39;re paid</text>
  <text start="800.29" dur="3.359">mercenaries controlled by the United</text>
  <text start="801.699" dur="4.2">States government central bankers they</text>
  <text start="803.649" dur="5.341">don&amp;#39;t care about the people they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="805.899" dur="5.611">care about peace they care about their</text>
  <text start="808.99" dur="5.969">paycheck and listening to whatever the</text>
  <text start="811.51" dur="6.24">US government central bankers say now we</text>
  <text start="814.959" dur="5.971">see that the elections are coming up we</text>
  <text start="817.75" dur="4.49">just had a debate and something very</text>
  <text start="820.93" dur="4.29">interesting and we mentioned this before</text>
  <text start="822.24" dur="5.83">where the United States two days before</text>
  <text start="825.22" dur="4.59">the second presidential debate the</text>
  <text start="828.07" dur="3.36">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="829.81" dur="4.23">with a department homeland</text>
  <text start="831.43" dur="4.83">dirty and the other intelligence</text>
  <text start="834.04" dur="6.57">agencies decided to come out and say yes</text>
  <text start="836.26" dur="7.8">Russia is hacking the democratic servers</text>
  <text start="840.61" dur="6.63">the Russians are hacking the election</text>
  <text start="844.06" dur="6.21">process and then during the debates we</text>
  <text start="847.24" dur="7.59">heard Clinton say that you know Russians</text>
  <text start="850.27" dur="9.06">are hacking the election systems to</text>
  <text start="854.83" dur="6.569">benefit Trump so what are we seeing</text>
  <text start="859.33" dur="3.9">right now it looks like they&amp;#39;re building</text>
  <text start="861.399" dur="3.841">the propaganda up because first of all</text>
  <text start="863.23" dur="3.39">there&amp;#39;s no proof that anyone is hacking</text>
  <text start="865.24" dur="4.44">anything and if we&amp;#39;re really concerned</text>
  <text start="866.62" dur="5.64">about hacking let&amp;#39;s not use the</text>
  <text start="869.68" dur="4.74">electronic devices let&amp;#39;s use paper then</text>
  <text start="872.26" dur="3.96">we not to worry about it but what</text>
  <text start="874.42" dur="5.359">they&amp;#39;re doing right now it looks like</text>
  <text start="876.22" dur="7.35">they&amp;#39;re making a move to explain away</text>
  <text start="879.779" dur="7.841">why they might need to postpone this why</text>
  <text start="883.57" dur="5.67">they the count might not be right it</text>
  <text start="887.62" dur="6">looks like they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out</text>
  <text start="889.24" dur="7.41">a way to explain why it&amp;#39;s not going the</text>
  <text start="893.62" dur="7.5">way they want it to go and why they need</text>
  <text start="896.65" dur="8.76">to maybe hold it and we can see right</text>
  <text start="901.12" dur="6.99">now that this is the direction they are</text>
  <text start="905.41" dur="4.29">on this is the path they&amp;#39;re on and we</text>
  <text start="908.11" dur="4.349">can see what the propaganda they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="909.7" dur="5.46">continually using this and I said this</text>
  <text start="912.459" dur="5.281">before forget about the corporate polls</text>
  <text start="915.16" dur="6.299">forget about what you&amp;#39;re seeing out</text>
  <text start="917.74" dur="6.45">there what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is if</text>
  <text start="921.459" dur="6">the elite the central bankers don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="924.19" dur="6.72">their way they&amp;#39;re getting ready to do</text>
  <text start="927.459" dur="5.491">something now they might do it they</text>
  <text start="930.91" dur="4.77">might not do it all depends on how</text>
  <text start="932.95" dur="5.87">everything goes but you can see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="935.68" dur="5.94">already building up the propaganda and</text>
  <text start="938.82" dur="4.18">it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter which candidate</text>
  <text start="941.62" dur="3.42">gets into office I know a lot of people</text>
  <text start="943" dur="5.16">saying yes we need Trump he will make a</text>
  <text start="945.04" dur="5.7">change Oh Clinton will do this if we</text>
  <text start="948.16" dur="4.61">really look at this situation here these</text>
  <text start="950.74" dur="5.07">two candidates they&amp;#39;re really not</text>
  <text start="952.77" dur="7.03">controlling what happens here in this</text>
  <text start="955.81" dur="6">country they will take orders from the</text>
  <text start="959.8" dur="4.19">shadow government the non elected</text>
  <text start="961.81" dur="3.27">government but they&amp;#39;re not in control</text>
  <text start="963.99" dur="2.92">now</text>
  <text start="965.08" dur="3.99">one might take orders better than the</text>
  <text start="966.91" dur="4.38">other and if the other doesn&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="969.07" dur="4.17">orders the way they want they&amp;#39;ll get rid</text>
  <text start="971.29" dur="5.22">of that person or they&amp;#39;ll make it so</text>
  <text start="973.24" dur="5.67">that person never gets into office so we</text>
  <text start="976.51" dur="4.91">have a situation here where it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="978.91" dur="5.19">matter who gets into office the</text>
  <text start="981.42" dur="5.83">non-elected shadow government is in</text>
  <text start="984.1" dur="6.75">trouble right now because the entire</text>
  <text start="987.25" dur="7.74">system is deteriorating the economic</text>
  <text start="990.85" dur="6.18">collapse is at their doorstep and what</text>
  <text start="994.99" dur="5.15">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="997.03" dur="7.2">preparing to go all out to start a war</text>
  <text start="1000.14" dur="6.31">to maybe postpone the elections to</text>
  <text start="1004.23" dur="3.78">explain away why it&amp;#39;s not going well and</text>
  <text start="1006.45" dur="3.96">why they need to halt it may be in the</text>
  <text start="1008.01" dur="4.32">middle of the elections but whatever</text>
  <text start="1010.41" dur="4.01">what they&amp;#39;re going to do we can see</text>
  <text start="1012.33" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re already planning for this</text>
  <text start="1014.42" dur="5.65">because they understand they need to get</text>
  <text start="1017.88" dur="4.5">a war started they need to cover up this</text>
  <text start="1020.07" dur="6.56">economic collapse and they need to make</text>
  <text start="1022.38" dur="10.89">sure that everyone realizes that Russia</text>
  <text start="1026.63" dur="8.709">China North Korea Syria Iran there</text>
  <text start="1033.27" dur="6.42">behind all this they&amp;#39;re working together</text>
  <text start="1035.339" dur="6.421">and we can see that this is where we are</text>
  <text start="1039.69" dur="4.29">headed right now and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1041.76" dur="4.439">interesting about these debates is that</text>
  <text start="1043.98" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re talking about Syria they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1046.199" dur="4.891">talking about all these different things</text>
  <text start="1048.81" dur="4.98">but it&amp;#39;s all propaganda you heard</text>
  <text start="1051.09" dur="5.82">Russian aggression you heard the</text>
  <text start="1053.79" dur="6.06">humanitarian aid that is needed in</text>
  <text start="1056.91" dur="6.14">Aleppo how its barbaric this is all</text>
  <text start="1059.85" dur="7.11">propaganda because these two candidates</text>
  <text start="1063.05" dur="6.28">they&amp;#39;re discussing issues that aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1066.96" dur="6">really going to the cause of why this is</text>
  <text start="1069.33" dur="9.72">all happening because they&amp;#39;re debating</text>
  <text start="1072.96" dur="8.25">on propaganda because think about it why</text>
  <text start="1079.05" dur="6.24">are we really in Syria in the first</text>
  <text start="1081.21" dur="6.3">place we know why it&amp;#39;s about the central</text>
  <text start="1085.29" dur="4.05">bankers it&amp;#39;s about the pipeline they</text>
  <text start="1087.51" dur="4.62">wanted to build it&amp;#39;s about the central</text>
  <text start="1089.34" dur="6.41">banking system it&amp;#39;s about the petro</text>
  <text start="1092.13" dur="7.29">dollar has nothing to do with energy</text>
  <text start="1095.75" dur="8.32">it&amp;#39;s about keeping the petrodollar there</text>
  <text start="1099.42" dur="7.22">system alive them in control so all of</text>
  <text start="1104.07" dur="6.27">this is meaningless at this point</text>
  <text start="1106.64" dur="8.35">because they&amp;#39;re not going to be the ones</text>
  <text start="1110.34" dur="8.16">in control the non-elected shadow</text>
  <text start="1114.99" dur="6.27">government they are in control they</text>
  <text start="1118.5" dur="6.87">always will be in control unless we go</text>
  <text start="1121.26" dur="7.77">to the heart of the problem and that is</text>
  <text start="1125.37" dur="7.62">the central bank the neocons we need to</text>
