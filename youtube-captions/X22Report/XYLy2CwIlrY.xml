  <text start="31.289" dur="5.311">96 and the title of this episode is</text>
  <text start="34.62" dur="4.619">we&amp;#39;ve turned the corner and or headed</text>
  <text start="36.6" dur="4.77">toward the economic collapse and as you</text>
  <text start="39.239" dur="5.191">can see the fed the plunge protection</text>
  <text start="41.37" dur="7.469">team the high-frequency traders tried</text>
  <text start="44.43" dur="6.72">all day to pump the stock market up the</text>
  <text start="48.839" dur="6.511">best they can but they just fell short</text>
  <text start="51.15" dur="7.35">of 15,000 points but we&amp;#39;ll see by next</text>
  <text start="55.35" dur="6.989">week they will continually pump it up</text>
  <text start="58.5" dur="6.809">and get it back over 15,000 because all</text>
  <text start="62.339" dur="5.701">eyes on the stock market before they let</text>
  <text start="65.309" dur="5.521">this baby go and they don&amp;#39;t want anyone</text>
  <text start="68.04" dur="4.71">to realize that the economy around them</text>
  <text start="70.83" dur="3.51">is falling apart so if you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="72.75" dur="3.719">looking at the stock market and every</text>
  <text start="74.34" dur="3.66">day people do and they say oh look the</text>
  <text start="76.469" dur="4.411">stock market&amp;#39;s up everything must be ok</text>
  <text start="78" dur="5.64">and that&amp;#39;s what they look at yesterday</text>
  <text start="80.88" dur="5.46">and the day before we had gold and it</text>
  <text start="83.64" dur="5.969">was slammed down and it went below 12</text>
  <text start="86.34" dur="6.9">hundred dollars an ounce today it&amp;#39;s back</text>
  <text start="89.609" dur="8.58">up it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s over twelve hundred</text>
  <text start="93.24" dur="8.909">dollars now and you know where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="98.189" dur="8.301">seeing things in the economy we are</text>
  <text start="102.149" dur="8.341">seeing things happening all around and</text>
  <text start="106.49" dur="5.89">and basically we&amp;#39;re going after this</text>
  <text start="110.49" dur="5.46">weekend we&amp;#39;re going down the path of</text>
  <text start="112.38" dur="7.68">hitting July independence day we have a</text>
  <text start="115.95" dur="9">lot of potential false flags coming up</text>
  <text start="120.06" dur="7.919">and just to understand this is I do not</text>
  <text start="124.95" dur="4.8">have a crystal ball in front of me what</text>
  <text start="127.979" dur="5.971">I&amp;#39;m doing is I&amp;#39;m taking all this</text>
  <text start="129.75" dur="6.69">information and trying to understand</text>
  <text start="133.95" dur="4.98">what is going on and explain what is</text>
  <text start="136.44" dur="4.08">going on and again even though we have a</text>
  <text start="138.93" dur="3.42">list of all these potential for</text>
  <text start="140.52" dur="4.62">flags and we&amp;#39;re looking at the economic</text>
  <text start="142.35" dur="4.71">news and we&amp;#39;re looking at war we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="145.14" dur="4.67">have a timeline we don&amp;#39;t know exactly</text>
  <text start="147.06" dur="6">which false flag they&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="149.81" dur="5.56">there are probably some false flag</text>
  <text start="153.06" dur="4.47">drills and things like that that we</text>
  <text start="155.37" dur="4.04">don&amp;#39;t even know about but we do know</text>
  <text start="157.53" dur="5.96">that something is going to happen</text>
  <text start="159.41" dur="8.37">because they need to get certain things</text>
  <text start="163.49" dur="9.48">completed before the collapse and</text>
  <text start="167.78" dur="5.19">yesterday I went over Naomi Wolf&amp;#39;s ten</text>
  <text start="173.93" dur="7.24">ten things that a closed society does</text>
  <text start="176.82" dur="7.23">and and it&amp;#39;s funny since I&amp;#39;ve read that</text>
  <text start="181.17" dur="7.26">and listen to the video and I put that</text>
  <text start="184.05" dur="7.14">page on the x 22 report site if you</text>
  <text start="188.43" dur="4.83">scroll all the way down on the homepage</text>
  <text start="191.19" dur="5.91">on the right hand side and go to</text>
  <text start="193.26" dur="6.47">articles it&amp;#39;s under I think it&amp;#39;s under</text>
  <text start="197.1" dur="5.13">rights I put it and you can see</text>
  <text start="199.73" dur="5.02">everything written out there that she</text>
  <text start="202.23" dur="4.47">talked about and if you go to</text>
  <text start="204.75" dur="4.08">yesterday&amp;#39;s episode which was episode</text>
  <text start="206.7" dur="5.13">number 95 all the way at the bottom of</text>
  <text start="208.83" dur="5.55">that page I also put it but now since</text>
  <text start="211.83" dur="5.42">I&amp;#39;ve been looking at that and every time</text>
  <text start="214.38" dur="7.05">I see something happening in the news it</text>
  <text start="217.25" dur="7.51">completely fits in what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="221.43" dur="5.34">and it&amp;#39;s funny because now I&amp;#39;m like holy</text>
  <text start="224.76" dur="5.51">crap that&amp;#39;s point number 8 that&amp;#39;s point</text>
  <text start="226.77" dur="8.07">number four and you can see that our</text>
  <text start="230.27" dur="7.45">whole entire way of life is going to</text>
  <text start="234.84" dur="6.21">change dramatically and I know we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="237.72" dur="5.55">talking about the collapse but there are</text>
  <text start="241.05" dur="7.02">many other things that go along with the</text>
  <text start="243.27" dur="7.17">collapse that I don&amp;#39;t think people talk</text>
  <text start="248.07" dur="6.27">about it here and there but when we put</text>
  <text start="250.44" dur="6.06">all this together this is really scary</text>
  <text start="254.34" dur="5.61">yes people are going to lose their</text>
  <text start="256.5" dur="5.88">wealth people are going to have their</text>
  <text start="259.95" dur="6.32">money frozen in their banks but the</text>
  <text start="262.38" dur="7.34">amount of Rights that we will lose</text>
  <text start="266.27" dur="7.18">because of what is happening is</text>
  <text start="269.72" dur="4.48">incredible and the destruction of the</text>
  <text start="273.45" dur="4.97">constant</text>
  <text start="274.2" dur="8.85">tution and all of the rights listed in</text>
  <text start="278.42" dur="10.39">the bill of rights are being removed one</text>
  <text start="283.05" dur="9.24">by one and before you know it everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="288.81" dur="7.2">going to wake up and this is the scary</text>
  <text start="292.29" dur="8.16">part where people when you&amp;#39;re on these</text>
  <text start="296.01" dur="8.57">lists show up at your door and you look</text>
  <text start="300.45" dur="8.82">out your window and there&amp;#39;s 20 military</text>
  <text start="304.58" dur="7.54">you know dressed up soldiers which are</text>
  <text start="309.27" dur="5.04">probably either DHS or black water and</text>
  <text start="312.12" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s funny because when people talk</text>
  <text start="314.31" dur="7.1">about foreign troops in America I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="317.79" dur="6.93">thinking to myself Blackwater they hire</text>
  <text start="321.41" dur="7.84">foreign troops up from all over the</text>
  <text start="324.72" dur="8.04">world and this is how I&amp;#39;m thinking of it</text>
  <text start="329.25" dur="8.37">we have DHS and we have black water and</text>
  <text start="332.76" dur="8.1">I think black water is working with DHS</text>
  <text start="337.62" dur="7.83">and can you imagine them showing up at</text>
  <text start="340.86" dur="8.73">your doorstep and just taking you away</text>
  <text start="345.45" dur="8.85">and your family sitting there going what</text>
  <text start="349.59" dur="6.48">the hell and this is the scary part yeah</text>
  <text start="354.3" dur="4.86">you can have your gold and your silver</text>
  <text start="356.07" dur="5.55">to protect yourself but if you&amp;#39;re on one</text>
  <text start="359.16" dur="5.22">of these lists because you have to</text>
  <text start="361.62" dur="5.39">remember we are now under if you&amp;#39;d like</text>
  <text start="364.38" dur="6.87">to admit it or not we are under a</text>
  <text start="367.01" dur="8.61">surveillance state everything you do</text>
  <text start="371.25" dur="7.74">everything that is done is being watched</text>
  <text start="375.62" dur="8.46">there is only one reason they do this</text>
  <text start="378.99" dur="9.42">and I&amp;#39;m talking about the government is</text>
  <text start="384.08" dur="6.96">to keep track of who&amp;#39;s who what groups</text>
  <text start="388.41" dur="7.4">they belong to are they a threat and</text>
  <text start="391.04" dur="7.39">this is what&amp;#39;s very upsetting and scary</text>
  <text start="395.81" dur="4.18">but let&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;ll go through this and</text>
  <text start="398.43" dur="3.66">we&amp;#39;ll get into everything and this is</text>
  <text start="399.99" dur="5.43">why I&amp;#39;m saying we&amp;#39;ve really turned the</text>
  <text start="402.09" dur="5.42">corner and we are heading down a very</text>
  <text start="405.42" dur="7.08">dark path</text>
  <text start="407.51" dur="8.1">and it just the the light at the end of</text>
  <text start="412.5" dur="8.4">the tunnel I hope we all wake up in time</text>
  <text start="415.61" dur="7.11">and we rise up to stop this and I know a</text>
  <text start="420.9" dur="6.78">lot of people like you know they say</text>
  <text start="422.72" dur="7.15">that you you can&amp;#39;t but you have to</text>
  <text start="427.68" dur="4.2">remember if you look at other countries</text>
  <text start="429.87" dur="4.26">and I know like oh they have they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="431.88" dur="4.29">just swoop by with an airplane and just</text>
  <text start="434.13" dur="3.57">drop bombs and everyone you have to</text>
  <text start="436.17" dur="4.89">remember in other countries most of the</text>
  <text start="437.7" dur="5.49">other countries don&amp;#39;t have weapons but</text>
  <text start="441.06" dur="5.16">they are able to make a difference</text>
  <text start="443.19" dur="9.24">because you have to remember there&amp;#39;s 350</text>
  <text start="446.22" dur="8.76">million people the armed forces and</text>
  <text start="452.43" dur="7.68">stuff when they see whatever true</text>
  <text start="454.98" dur="9.75">revolution happens even the army the</text>
  <text start="460.11" dur="7.4">military realizes what&amp;#39;s happening now</text>
  <text start="464.73" dur="6.78">Blackwater and the other brainwashed</text>
  <text start="467.51" dur="6.58">agencies that they set up might be</text>
  <text start="471.51" dur="4.29">fighting but you have to remember a lot</text>
  <text start="474.09" dur="4.32">of these people in the military and</text>
  <text start="475.8" dur="4.29">their families who are saying this is</text>
  <text start="478.41" dur="4.71">wrong they&amp;#39;re not going to swoop down</text>
  <text start="480.09" dur="4.74">and drop bombs on people because it</text>
  <text start="483.12" dur="4.98">could be their families it could be</text>
  <text start="484.83" dur="6.15">their cousins it could be someone they</text>
  <text start="488.1" dur="5.01">know so we have to think of this for a</text>
  <text start="490.98" dur="3.96">while because they&amp;#39;re loyal to the</text>
  <text start="493.11" dur="4.95">country of what the country stands for</text>
  <text start="494.94" dur="5.31">and this is what I like to believe that</text>
  <text start="498.06" dur="4.05">this is what would happen because when</text>
  <text start="500.25" dur="4.2">you look in other countries that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="502.11" dur="7.14">have weapons and that we have a true</text>
  <text start="504.45" dur="6.84">revolution and people rise up people</text>
  <text start="509.25" dur="3.48">join together but we&amp;#39;ll get into that</text>
  <text start="511.29" dur="2.67">and a little later because there are</text>
  <text start="512.73" dur="3.63">certain things that are happening in</text>
  <text start="513.96" dur="4.68">other countries that don&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="516.36" dur="4.29">but let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="518.64" dur="5.7">news and let&amp;#39;s see what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="520.65" dur="6.51">now the available gold supply is</text>
  <text start="524.34" dur="5.19">disappearing as gold prices plunges now</text>
  <text start="527.16" dur="6.11">that to me is common sense of course</text>
  <text start="529.53" dur="8.13">it&amp;#39;s all disappearing the prices are</text>
  <text start="533.27" dur="7.74">purposely being slammed down so banks</text>
  <text start="537.66" dur="8.76">central bankers countries</text>
  <text start="541.01" dur="11.59">certain people can purchase the physical</text>
  <text start="546.42" dur="10.25">at reduced prices and we have to think</text>
  <text start="552.6" dur="6.21">of it this way the Fed is creating</text>
  <text start="556.67" dur="5.109">different bubbles the stock market</text>
  <text start="558.81" dur="5.399">bubble the Treasury bond bubble the</text>
  <text start="561.779" dur="5.971">student loan bubble and they want to</text>
  <text start="564.209" dur="5.671">include gold into this bubble because I</text>
  <text start="567.75" dur="4.079">heard a lot of people talking about the</text>
  <text start="569.88" dur="5.67">gold and silver precious metals are in a</text>
  <text start="571.829" dur="7.801">bubble so can you imagine if they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="575.55" dur="6.81">slam down gold and silver and the other</text>
  <text start="579.63" dur="4.86">precious metals right now while the</text>
  <text start="582.36" dur="5.039">stock market is dropping while tapering</text>
  <text start="584.49" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re talking about tapering and all</text>
  <text start="587.399" dur="7.041">this other they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="588.66" dur="10.549">about and gold was rising at this point</text>
  <text start="594.44" dur="4.769">what do you think people would do as</text>
  <text start="599.36" dur="6.039">people would start taking their money</text>
  <text start="602.25" dur="6.47">and putting it into gold and silver and</text>
  <text start="605.399" dur="8.781">buying all the physical they possibly</text>
  <text start="608.72" dur="8.71">could so the Fed and the central bankers</text>
  <text start="614.18" dur="6.19">can&amp;#39;t have that happen so what they need</text>
  <text start="617.43" dur="7.23">to do is push it down and make people</text>
  <text start="620.37" dur="6.779">believe it&amp;#39;s not good to get into it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="624.66" dur="4.38">almost like in the Great Depression when</text>
  <text start="627.149" dur="4.44">everyone had to turn in their gold and</text>
  <text start="629.04" dur="4.859">they paid everyone twenty dollars an</text>
  <text start="631.589" dur="4.381">ounce and as soon as they had all the</text>
  <text start="633.899" dur="3.991">gold the gold one from twenty dollars an</text>
  <text start="635.97" dur="6.66">ounce to thirty-five dollars an ounce</text>
  <text start="637.89" dur="7.86">and we also saw this happen in 2008</text>
  <text start="642.63" dur="6.959">right before the crash gold went down</text>
  <text start="645.75" dur="7.74">and afterwards it went back up because</text>
  <text start="649.589" dur="6.571">they need to keep the illusion going the</text>
  <text start="653.49" dur="5.459">stock market is the place to be during</text>
  <text start="656.16" dur="4.289">2008 the stock market and the real</text>
  <text start="658.949" dur="4.741">estate market and i should say no to</text>
  <text start="660.449" dur="6.841">also and is the place to be and people</text>
  <text start="663.69" dur="6.48">were buying homes at the height height</text>
  <text start="667.29" dur="4.68">height of the market and not even</text>
  <text start="670.17" dur="3.75">looking at gold and silver can you</text>
  <text start="671.97" dur="2.309">imagine instead of buying that house</text>
  <text start="673.92" dur="3.329">what</text>
  <text start="674.279" dur="5.67">they the news was out pushing the Fed</text>
  <text start="677.249" dur="6.84">was out pushing Goldman Sachs was</text>
  <text start="679.949" dur="7.711">pushing but betting against it q imagine</text>
  <text start="684.089" dur="5.881">if you took your money all that money</text>
  <text start="687.66" dur="6.359">that you spent on that home and put it</text>
  <text start="689.97" dur="8.849">into gold and silver this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="694.019" dur="10.201">happening right now all right let&amp;#39;s move</text>
  <text start="698.819" dur="8.01">on here and let&amp;#39;s say a former Reagan</text>
  <text start="704.22" dur="4.77">White House budget director this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="706.829" dur="5.94">going to end well the Fed has painted</text>
  <text start="708.99" dur="8.449">itself into a corner again I said this</text>
  <text start="712.769" dur="9.24">before also the Fed if they stop</text>
  <text start="717.439" dur="8.671">printing money propping up the stock</text>
  <text start="722.009" dur="6.51">market by buying the toxic assets from</text>
  <text start="726.11" dur="4.719">the banks and the banks putting the</text>
  <text start="728.519" dur="4.26">money back into the stock market if they</text>
  <text start="730.829" dur="5.401">stop that now or they continue printing</text>
  <text start="732.779" dur="7.35">it makes no difference we&amp;#39;re screwed</text>
  <text start="736.23" dur="6.06">either way if they stop right now the</text>
  <text start="740.129" dur="4.44">collapse happens right now if they</text>
  <text start="742.29" dur="6.39">continue printing the government has a</text>
  <text start="744.569" dur="6.96">chance to do what they need to do to get</text>
  <text start="748.68" dur="6.089">this closed system completely closed</text>
  <text start="751.529" dur="6.511">down locked down and ready for the</text>
  <text start="754.769" dur="7.29">collapse and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="758.04" dur="6.57">but David Stockman you know thinks and</text>
  <text start="762.059" dur="5.311">believes the Fed has created a massive</text>
  <text start="764.61" dur="4.169">bubble which we all know he sounds off</text>
  <text start="767.37" dur="3.269">on the Fed and the huge financial</text>
  <text start="768.779" dur="4.56">challenges we face in the months and</text>
  <text start="770.639" dur="5.94">years ahead American economy faces a</text>

  <text start="1326.59" dur="9.09">that prove anything no it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="1331.81" dur="6.9">why would the people then want to follow</text>
  <text start="1335.68" dur="5.609">these leaders it</text>
  <text start="1338.71" dur="5.959">makes no sense and the reason why it</text>
  <text start="1341.289" dur="8.851">makes no sense is because the people in</text>
  <text start="1344.669" dur="10.38">Syria are not Syrians they are hired</text>
  <text start="1350.14" dur="8.61">mercenary soldiers to create an uprising</text>
  <text start="1355.049" dur="6.551">hired by the US government agencies</text>
  <text start="1358.75" dur="5.159">they&amp;#39;ve done this in Egypt they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="1361.6" dur="6.209">this in Libya they&amp;#39;ve done this in</text>
  <text start="1363.909" dur="6.27">Lebanon they&amp;#39;ve done this in Iraq except</text>
  <text start="1367.809" dur="3.571">we went into Iraq button you know we we</text>
  <text start="1370.179" dur="4.591">completely went in there and and</text>
  <text start="1371.38" dur="8.659">switched it over and they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="1374.77" dur="12.57">in Syria and this is how you know that</text>
  <text start="1380.039" dur="11.11">this is not a real revolution now in</text>
  <text start="1387.34" dur="6.059">Egypt okay there is a central bank they</text>
  <text start="1391.149" dur="9.331">trade their oil in the but using the</text>
  <text start="1393.399" dur="16.16">petro dollar and basically the people</text>
  <text start="1400.48" dur="12.54">are rising up and they are basically</text>
  <text start="1409.559" dur="8.281">rallying against the government now the</text>
  <text start="1413.02" dur="8.67">United States government is supplying</text>
  <text start="1417.84" dur="10.449">Egypt with security forces and we&amp;#39;ll use</text>
  <text start="1421.69" dur="9.27">this to bring in weapons and other</text>
  <text start="1428.289" dur="4.26">assets because they already have it in</text>
  <text start="1430.96" dur="6.15">Jordan when they did the Jordan drill</text>
  <text start="1432.549" dur="8.071">and this will be used to secure and make</text>
  <text start="1437.11" dur="6.39">sure that the people do not overthrow</text>
  <text start="1440.62" dur="6.15">what they&amp;#39;ve set up already and plus</text>
  <text start="1443.5" dur="6.24">they will have the weapons in Egypt for</text>
  <text start="1446.77" dur="6.11">the eventual war which will take place</text>
  <text start="1449.74" dur="7.289">to cover up the entire economic collapse</text>
  <text start="1452.88" dur="7.929">this is basically what I think is going</text>
  <text start="1457.029" dur="5.911">on there because you know every time you</text>
  <text start="1460.809" dur="4.051">have to think of it this way when we go</text>
  <text start="1462.94" dur="4.65">into a country and we&amp;#39;re saying there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1464.86" dur="5.189">a revolution and they overthrow the the</text>
  <text start="1467.59" dur="4.87">the the government this highly hired</text>
  <text start="1470.049" dur="4.841">mercenaries and we put in our puppet</text>
  <text start="1472.46" dur="3.75">regime and we put a central bank and we</text>
  <text start="1474.89" dur="3.54">put everything back on the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="1476.21" dur="4.05">then the people start realizing what the</text>
  <text start="1478.43" dur="4.38">hell just happened that this is not the</text>
  <text start="1480.26" dur="5.85">government they wanted and they rise up</text>
  <text start="1482.81" dur="4.53">again it&amp;#39;s very difficult for the US</text>
  <text start="1486.11" dur="2.91">government to say there&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="1487.34" dur="4.35">revolution going on because they just</text>
  <text start="1489.02" dur="5.49">had one so when you see people rising up</text>
  <text start="1491.69" dur="5.67">like in Egypt like in Libya and like</text>
  <text start="1494.51" dur="8.76">Lebanon again these are the real people</text>
  <text start="1497.36" dur="8.73">and basically we send troops and</text>
  <text start="1503.27" dur="7.23">security advisors and all these people</text>
  <text start="1506.09" dur="5.97">in there to control the situation but</text>
  <text start="1510.5" dur="4.53">we&amp;#39;re not going to get involved but in</text>
  <text start="1512.06" dur="5.61">the end we will get involved but this is</text>
  <text start="1515.03" dur="5.31">what happens every single time just go</text>
  <text start="1517.67" dur="7.92">back and look and you can see it it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="1520.34" dur="6.96">obvious okay let&amp;#39;s move on here now</text>
  <text start="1525.59" dur="5.55">we&amp;#39;ve talked about that we&amp;#39;re under a</text>
  <text start="1527.3" dur="6.06">complete surveillance state this is</text>

  <text start="1866.12" dur="2.72">that they&amp;#39;re doing now</text>
  <text start="1870.61" dur="5.88">Shannon Richardson was arrested for</text>

  <text start="1882.25" dur="5.73">think she also sent one allegedly to</text>
  <text start="1885.52" dur="6.44">Bloomberg also but what I find</text>
  <text start="1887.98" dur="7.77">interesting is the story is that she</text>
  <text start="1891.96" dur="10.839">sent these letters to try to frame her</text>
  <text start="1895.75" dur="10.89">husband and it basically what it says</text>
  <text start="1902.799" dur="7.771">here she tried to in attempt to frame</text>
  <text start="1906.64" dur="5.94">her estranged husband using these</text>

  <text start="1912.58" dur="8.55">and Mayor Bloomberg and what the letter</text>
  <text start="1917.2" dur="6.81">said is this in and this is what it says</text>
  <text start="1921.13" dur="4.58">in the rice and letter addressed to</text>
  <text start="1924.01" dur="4.44">President Obama mailed May twentieth</text>

  <text start="1938.89" dur="8.46">in the face now it just this is starting</text>
  <text start="1943.66" dur="7.11">to sing a little ridiculous because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1947.35" dur="6.209">amazing and this happened during the</text>
  <text start="1950.77" dur="6.539">voting on the gun bill during the Boston</text>
  <text start="1953.559" dur="7.681">bombing while the gun bill was in the</text>
  <text start="1957.309" dur="8.511">Senate Oh Bloomberg is going after the</text>
  <text start="1961.24" dur="7.79">guns and it just seems to fit way to</text>
  <text start="1965.82" dur="7.96">perfectly into this whole entire thing</text>
  <text start="1969.03" dur="9.01">and I am Telling You they are painting</text>
  <text start="1973.78" dur="6.45">gun owners as crazy people and the</text>
  <text start="1978.04" dur="3.78">Boston bombing and what I found very</text>
  <text start="1980.23" dur="6.18">interesting about them just go back to</text>
  <text start="1981.82" dur="7.2">the Boston bombing for a sec that during</text>
  <text start="1986.41" dur="5.28">the Boston bombing before this happened</text>
  <text start="1989.02" dur="5.61">there was a scheduled operation urban</text>
  <text start="1991.69" dur="5.16">shield and it was meant to train dozens</text>
  <text start="1994.63" dur="4.08">of detectives in the Greater Boston area</text>
  <text start="1996.85" dur="4.59">to work together to thwart a terrorist</text>
  <text start="1998.71" dur="5.57">threat the hypothetical terrorist group</text>
  <text start="2001.44" dur="2.84">was</text>
  <text start="2005.029" dur="5.02">was even given a name and I thought this</text>
  <text start="2008.58" dur="4.199">was very interesting and this is what</text>
  <text start="2010.049" dur="4.651">made me think of it with her and at the</text>
  <text start="2012.779" dur="6.39">whole Boston bombing thing the name was</text>
  <text start="2014.7" dur="8.91">given free America citizens a homegrown</text>
  <text start="2019.169" dur="8.721">cadre of militiamen whose logo would be</text>
  <text start="2023.61" dur="8.16">a metal school wearing an uncle sam hat</text>
  <text start="2027.89" dur="6.789">now I said this in my previous episodes</text>
  <text start="2031.77" dur="9.57">I do believe the Boston bombing was</text>
  <text start="2034.679" dur="8.671">really set up to go after gun owners</text>
  <text start="2041.34" dur="4.29">because they were making the case with</text>
  <text start="2043.35" dur="4.53">the black powder and how gun owners have</text>
  <text start="2045.63" dur="4.229">accessed the gunpowder and they can use</text>
  <text start="2047.88" dur="5.67">this and paint them as a crazy person</text>
  <text start="2049.859" dur="6.99">and this led these rice and letters were</text>
  <text start="2053.55" dur="5.49">sent off and what she said in these</text>
  <text start="2056.849" dur="4.02">letters you know allegedly that you know</text>
  <text start="2059.04" dur="3.27">I&amp;#39;m a gun loving person and I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="2060.869" dur="3.27">shoot you in my face if you come and you</text>
  <text start="2062.31" dur="6.829">not take my guns the whole thing was</text>
  <text start="2064.139" dur="8.04">being set up in that way and basically</text>
  <text start="2069.139" dur="6.671">everything started to fall apart people</text>
  <text start="2072.179" dur="5.97">were taking too many pictures and they</text>
  <text start="2075.81" dur="3.9">had a distraction down in Texas and I</text>
  <text start="2078.149" dur="7.801">know I repeat I&amp;#39;m repeating myself but</text>
  <text start="2079.71" dur="9.78">this just is all fitting into me of what</text>
  <text start="2085.95" dur="5.34">was really going on and their you know</text>
  <text start="2089.49" dur="4.05">their their state of mind because the</text>
  <text start="2091.29" dur="4.02">gun bill was being voted on and they</text>
  <text start="2093.54" dur="6.78">really really really wanted that passed</text>
  <text start="2095.31" dur="8.58">and that&amp;#39;s what I think was going on now</text>
  <text start="2100.32" dur="7.5">let&amp;#39;s move on here now we talked about</text>
  <text start="2103.89" dur="7.5">that that we are in the total</text>
  <text start="2107.82" dur="6.72">surveillance state and more information</text>
  <text start="2111.39" dur="4.58">is coming out that JW obtains records</text>

  <text start="2125.88" dur="4.469">where you are every minute of the day</text>
  <text start="2128.369" dur="4.771">because you have to remember most people</text>
  <text start="2130.349" dur="4.711">do not use cash they slide their debit</text>
  <text start="2133.14" dur="4.469">card where they slide their credit card</text>
  <text start="2135.06" dur="5.039">or for those people are paying by there</text>
  <text start="2137.609" dur="6.66">our cell phones now pay by their cell</text>
  <text start="2140.099" dur="8.101">phone so they are tracking everybody all</text>
  <text start="2144.269" dur="7.611">around putting people on lists knowing</text>
  <text start="2148.2" dur="7.079">where you are every minute of the day</text>
  <text start="2151.88" dur="7.229">basically our constitutional rights are</text>
  <text start="2155.279" dur="8.941">being ripped shredded and torn apart</text>
  <text start="2159.109" dur="11.44">where nobody has any privacy anymore and</text>
  <text start="2164.22" dur="12.569">I read someplace that a the Nazi Germany</text>
  <text start="2170.549" dur="9.96">I think it was a maybe it was in Russian</text>
  <text start="2176.789" dur="6.631">maybe it was the KGB in Russia that this</text>
  <text start="2180.509" dur="5.52">whole system that we have here they</text>
  <text start="2183.42" dur="6.02">would have loved to spy on their people</text>
  <text start="2186.029" dur="7.141">and i believe it was Russian the KGB and</text>
  <text start="2189.44" dur="5.859">basically during Nazi Germany they did</text>
  <text start="2193.17" dur="5.97">the same thing there was a surveillance</text>
  <text start="2195.299" dur="7.44">state and they were spying on their</text>
  <text start="2199.14" dur="6">people and putting them into groups and</text>
  <text start="2202.739" dur="5.55">that&amp;#39;s why they were able to move in so</text>
  <text start="2205.14" dur="7.169">quickly when the time came same thing is</text>
  <text start="2208.289" dur="7.891">happening here today all right let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2212.309" dur="6.77">move on here now I know I talk about</text>
  <text start="2216.18" dur="7.079">cyber attacks a lot and the cyber attack</text>
  <text start="2219.079" dur="6.93">that was scheduled for June</text>
  <text start="2223.259" dur="5.25">twenty-eighth witches today has been</text>
  <text start="2226.009" dur="7.151">conveniently changed to July eighteenth</text>
  <text start="2228.509" dur="6.54">and why did this happen don&amp;#39;t know seems</text>
  <text start="2233.16" dur="5.459">a little suspicious to me but they</text>
  <text start="2235.049" dur="5.28">decided to change it and now it is July</text>
  <text start="2238.619" dur="4.321">eighteenth with which is now eight</text>
  <text start="2240.329" dur="5.071">Thursday that they&amp;#39;re going to use the</text>
  <text start="2242.94" dur="7.77">quantum dawn to so we&amp;#39;ll be watching out</text>
  <text start="2245.4" dur="7.5">for this potential false flag and when I</text>
  <text start="2250.71" dur="4.77">find very interesting is that all the</text>
  <text start="2252.9" dur="7.649">news agencies Reuters Bloomberg all</text>
  <text start="2255.48" dur="8.069">reported the jun 28 state and I can</text>
  <text start="2260.549" dur="5.04">barely find any reporting the switch to</text>
  <text start="2263.549" dur="3.54">July eighteenth except for one that I</text>
  <text start="2265.589" dur="3.871">have linked on my page</text>
  <text start="2267.089" dur="4.561">and actually if you go to sip m&amp;#39;a which</text>
  <text start="2269.46" dur="4.349">i also have linked here they report it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2271.65" dur="5.429">on July eighteenth also i find it very</text>
  <text start="2273.809" dur="8.73">odd very suspicious that this was done</text>
  <text start="2277.079" dur="8.94">but we&amp;#39;ll have to follow it now the DHS</text>
  <text start="2282.539" dur="6.78">national risk assessment estimate on gps</text>
  <text start="2286.019" dur="4.95">disruption still a lot of non knowns</text>
  <text start="2289.319" dur="6.27">basically what they&amp;#39;re saying is that</text>
  <text start="2290.969" dur="6.721">the gia gps can disrupt the critical</text>
  <text start="2295.589" dur="7.01">infrastructure and I just for some</text>
  <text start="2297.69" dur="7.879">reason the DHS is continually harping on</text>
  <text start="2302.599" dur="6.94">the infrastructure in the United States</text>
  <text start="2305.569" dur="6.73">power grid electrical nuclear and now</text>
  <text start="2309.539" dur="8.161">they&amp;#39;re bringing up GPS disruptions and</text>
  <text start="2312.299" dur="7.26">jamming could potentially harm critical</text>
  <text start="2317.7" dur="5.43">infrastructure sectors in the United</text>
