  <text start="115.74" dur="4.559">what looks like phase two of the plan</text>
  <text start="117.81" dur="5.64">has already started here we are one day</text>
  <text start="120.299" dur="5.67">after the elections and we see that the</text>
  <text start="123.45" dur="6.15">mainstream media they are pushing back</text>
  <text start="125.969" dur="6.27">on what Trump is doing Trump his</text>
  <text start="129.6" dur="5.22">administration they flexed their muscles</text>
  <text start="132.239" dur="5.821">with Swift and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="134.82" dur="5.729">controlling Swift right now we&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="138.06" dur="6.72">into that in just a minute but first out</text>
  <text start="140.549" dur="7.891">in the UK we see that Theresa May they</text>
  <text start="144.78" dur="5.34">are doing whatever they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="148.44" dur="3.93">push their deal and it looks like</text>
  <text start="150.12" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re putting the cart before the</text>
  <text start="152.37" dur="4.98">horse Mays leadership team they decided</text>
  <text start="155.91" dur="4.189">to skip the hard part and start</text>
  <text start="157.35" dur="4.98">formulating a plan to sell the deal</text>
  <text start="160.099" dur="4.991">whatever that might be we don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="162.33" dur="4.799">know may we&amp;#39;ll try to sell the deal</text>
  <text start="165.09" dur="5.039">top officials plan to stress a strategy</text>
  <text start="167.129" dur="6.901">of measured success that this is going</text>
  <text start="170.129" dur="6.181">to be good for everyone really when the</text>
  <text start="174.03" dur="5.429">plan was done in secret so how is she</text>
  <text start="176.31" dur="6.56">going to try to push this on the people</text>
  <text start="179.459" dur="5.521">of the UK well the plan relies on</text>
  <text start="182.87" dur="4.72">endorsements from foreign leaders like</text>
  <text start="184.98" dur="4.71">Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe a as</text>
  <text start="187.59" dur="5.22">well as a flurry of corporate</text>
  <text start="189.69" dur="6.48">endorsements to try to convince the</text>
  <text start="192.81" dur="5.009">public that this is a good plane which</text>
  <text start="196.17" dur="4.89">tells you something right there and then</text>
  <text start="197.819" dur="4.861">it&amp;#39;s a bad plan and we talked about this</text>
  <text start="201.06" dur="3.63">before and it looks like what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="202.68" dur="5.16">trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="204.69" dur="6.06">this plan into the transition phase and</text>
  <text start="207.84" dur="4.89">never go anywhere with it but they need</text>
  <text start="210.75" dur="5.16">the backing of other leaders</text>
  <text start="212.73" dur="6.089">corporations to say hey we endorse this</text>
  <text start="215.91" dur="7.62">this is really good but in the meantime</text>
  <text start="218.819" dur="7.411">the plans secret the people don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="223.53" dur="4.95">have any idea what it really is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="226.23" dur="3.569">gonna get bits and pieces and most of</text>
  <text start="228.48" dur="4.069">the people that voted for the brexit</text>
  <text start="229.799" dur="6.391">they&amp;#39;re not going to agree with it and</text>
  <text start="232.549" dur="6.401">we see that this is not the deal that</text>
  <text start="236.19" dur="5.669">everyone wants and again government not</text>
  <text start="238.95" dur="5.52">listening to the people we see here in</text>
  <text start="241.859" dur="5.581">the United States things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="244.47" dur="4.32">falling apart and it usually begins in</text>
  <text start="247.44" dur="4.29">the real estate market and if you</text>
  <text start="248.79" dur="4.62">remember back in 2008 when they told us</text>
  <text start="251.73" dur="3.06">that the real estate market is contained</text>
  <text start="253.41" dur="2.669">don&amp;#39;t worry about it that started to</text>
  <text start="254.79" dur="3.509">fall apart then everything else started</text>
  <text start="256.079" dur="4.201">to fall apart around that whole entire</text>
  <text start="258.299" dur="4.291">thing corporations fell apart and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="260.28" dur="4.29">all connected what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="262.59" dur="4.199">now is the Fed continually raises rates</text>
  <text start="264.57" dur="5.99">we&amp;#39;re seeing that mortgage applications</text>
  <text start="266.789" dur="9.181">they have plummeted to an 18-year low</text>
  <text start="270.56" dur="6.76">last time we saw this was 2010 and this</text>
  <text start="275.97" dur="2.49">should not be a surprise to anyone</text>
  <text start="277.32" dur="4.14">because we discussed this many times</text>
  <text start="278.46" dur="4.47">many times before as the Fed continually</text>
  <text start="281.46" dur="3.54">raises rates it&amp;#39;s going to push people</text>
  <text start="282.93" dur="4.14">out of the market housing is going to</text>
  <text start="285" dur="3.93">become way too expensive we already know</text>
  <text start="287.07" dur="4.17">that people can&amp;#39;t even afford these</text>
  <text start="288.93" dur="4.65">houses right now and it&amp;#39;s going to get</text>
  <text start="291.24" dur="3.66">worse actually Wells Fargo they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="293.58" dur="3.45">showing that their pipeline is</text>
  <text start="294.9" dur="4.68">completely collapsing</text>
  <text start="297.03" dur="5.34">and we&amp;#39;re seeing that the housing market</text>
  <text start="299.58" dur="5.73">is starting to turn the other way right</text>
  <text start="302.37" dur="4.95">now and when you really look at the US</text>
  <text start="305.31" dur="7.26">mortgage applications it has been on a</text>
  <text start="307.32" dur="7.92">decline since 2012</text>
  <text start="312.57" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s bobbed up and down but if you look</text>
  <text start="315.24" dur="6.51">at the trajectory it&amp;#39;s completely in a</text>
  <text start="317.82" dur="7.17">downward motion right now and what do</text>
  <text start="321.75" dur="6.03">these numbers reveal it reveals that the</text>
  <text start="324.99" dur="5.01">average US consumer can barely afford to</text>
  <text start="327.78" dur="6.63">take out a new mortgage at a time when</text>
  <text start="330" dur="6.66">rates continue to rise the weakening</text>
  <text start="334.41" dur="3.9">housing market is similar to the last</text>
  <text start="336.66" dur="4.46">market high just before the subprime</text>
  <text start="338.31" dur="6.54">housing bubble burst a decade ago</text>
  <text start="341.12" dur="7.18">if we look at this we&amp;#39;re back where we</text>
  <text start="344.85" dur="6.66">started the economy didn&amp;#39;t improve under</text>
  <text start="348.3" dur="5.1">Obama it&amp;#39;s not improving now all they</text>
  <text start="351.51" dur="4.38">did was create this illusion look what</text>
  <text start="353.4" dur="5.73">happens when the Fed raises the rates</text>
  <text start="355.89" dur="6.3">just a little bit everything starts to</text>
  <text start="359.13" dur="6.53">fall apart this is part of the plan</text>
  <text start="362.19" dur="5.97">right now this is why they were not</text>
  <text start="365.66" dur="4.87">raising the rates under Obama because</text>
  <text start="368.16" dur="4.8">they knew back then it would destroy the</text>
  <text start="370.53" dur="3.87">economy they&amp;#39;re raising the rates and</text>
  <text start="372.96" dur="3.12">they started to raise the rates when</text>
  <text start="374.4" dur="4.62">Trump before Trump came right into</text>
  <text start="376.08" dur="4.74">office and they did it after he was in</text>
  <text start="379.02" dur="3.42">office and they did this on purpose</text>
  <text start="380.82" dur="3.51">because they thought Oh</text>
  <text start="382.44" dur="5.7">once he gets in there we&amp;#39;ll wait a</text>
  <text start="384.33" dur="6.78">certain period of time and at that time</text>
  <text start="388.14" dur="6">the economy will be his the economy will</text>
  <text start="391.11" dur="4.65">be turning in the opposite direction of</text>
  <text start="394.14" dur="3.84">Obama will get worse and worse and worse</text>
  <text start="395.76" dur="4.17">will raise the rates and will blame the</text>
  <text start="397.98" dur="4.53">whole thing on Trump but Trump turned</text>
  <text start="399.93" dur="4.4">this around and he continually shows how</text>
  <text start="402.51" dur="3.78">the economy&amp;#39;s doing fantastically and</text>
  <text start="404.33" dur="3.94">the corporate media doesn&amp;#39;t know what to</text>
  <text start="406.29" dur="4.53">do with this they&amp;#39;re stuck on this point</text>
  <text start="408.27" dur="4.05">but I do believe the plan is to</text>
  <text start="410.82" dur="4.8">continually raise the rates and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="412.32" dur="5.24">working with Powell to do this and he</text>
  <text start="415.62" dur="5.22">continually contradicts the Fed on</text>
  <text start="417.56" dur="5.56">purpose he&amp;#39;s laying the groundwork we</text>
  <text start="420.84" dur="4.95">already see out of the Washington Post</text>
  <text start="423.12" dur="3.44">and this is the headline out of The</text>
  <text start="425.79" dur="4.42">Washington Post</text>
  <text start="426.56" dur="5.3">Trump&amp;#39;s Fed bashing is wrong</text>
  <text start="430.21" dur="4.109">but should the Fed be entirely</text>
  <text start="431.86" dur="5.76">independent now what they do is they go</text>
  <text start="434.319" dur="5.731">through all of this to you know tell you</text>
  <text start="437.62" dur="4.74">why the Fed should be independent now</text>
  <text start="440.05" dur="5.73">the article starts off in the following</text>
  <text start="442.36" dur="5.19">way Trump has publicly and harshly</text>
  <text start="445.78" dur="3.96">rebuked the Federal Reserve Board</text>
  <text start="447.55" dur="3.839">Chairman Jerome Powell for what the</text>
  <text start="449.74" dur="4.01">president regards as the misguided</text>

  <text start="453.75" dur="6.19">continued economic expansion as with</text>
  <text start="457.21" dur="4.019">much of what Trump says and does this</text>
  <text start="459.94" dur="3.42">way of doing business is</text>
  <text start="461.229" dur="4.44">counterproductive irrespective of</text>
  <text start="463.36" dur="4.98">whatever merit his underlying position</text>
  <text start="465.669" dur="4.771">may have no self-respecting central</text>
  <text start="468.34" dur="4.65">banker can be seen as yielding to</text>
  <text start="470.44" dur="5.039">pressure from a politician facing a</text>
  <text start="472.99" dur="4.53">difficult election a central bank that</text>
  <text start="475.479" dur="4.321">appears subservient to a political</text>

  <text start="487.599" dur="8.16">bashing is a fool&amp;#39;s game so already</text>
  <text start="492.819" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;re building up the argument of why</text>
  <text start="495.759" dur="4.891">this isn&amp;#39;t good and if Trump is</text>
  <text start="498.699" dur="4.801">continually doing this it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="500.65" dur="6.6">hurt the economy now they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="503.5" dur="5.729">gain the narrative with this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="507.25" dur="6.27">looking at this saying well the Fed</text>
  <text start="509.229" dur="7.5">should be independent and Trump should</text>
  <text start="513.52" dur="5.189">not try to push the Fed in a certain</text>
  <text start="516.729" dur="4.05">direction and if you really think about</text>
  <text start="518.709" dur="4.351">what Trump is doing he&amp;#39;s saying listen I</text>
  <text start="520.779" dur="3.661">don&amp;#39;t agree with the Fed I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="523.06" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re they should be raising rates</text>
  <text start="524.44" dur="5.76">right now but you know what they know</text>
  <text start="527.2" dur="5.52">best they know what they&amp;#39;re doing and if</text>
  <text start="530.2" dur="5.37">they want to raise rates it&amp;#39;s up to them</text>
  <text start="532.72" dur="5.489">but if the economy falls apart it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="535.57" dur="6.66">their fault so he&amp;#39;s not really</text>
  <text start="538.209" dur="6.601">pressuring them he&amp;#39;s just laying the</text>
  <text start="542.23" dur="4.32">breadcrumbs to let everyone know if they</text>
  <text start="544.81" dur="5.04">continue to do this he&amp;#39;s not agreeing</text>
  <text start="546.55" dur="6.779">with it and the economy falls apart they</text>
  <text start="549.85" dur="6.479">are to blame and here they are trying to</text>
  <text start="553.329" dur="4.971">defend the Fed and try to make sense of</text>
  <text start="556.329" dur="5.281">what is going on here</text>
  <text start="558.3" dur="5.26">now we know that minuchin who&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="563.56" dur="8.3">the Trump administration they called</text>
  <text start="565.629" dur="9.06">unswept to cut off the Iranian banks and</text>
  <text start="571.86" dur="8.44">Swift right now is a central bank system</text>
  <text start="574.689" dur="8.76">and we see that Swift caved to the Trump</text>
  <text start="580.3" dur="7.949">administration and what did they do well</text>
  <text start="583.449" dur="8.481">they shut down the Swift system to the</text>
  <text start="588.249" dur="5.911">Iranian banks and this was their message</text>
  <text start="591.93" dur="4.75">this is coming from the Belgium based</text>
  <text start="594.16" dur="5.25">financial messaging service this step</text>
  <text start="596.68" dur="4.589">while regrettable has been taking in the</text>

  <text start="601.269" dur="6.901">of the wider global financial system</text>
  <text start="604.769" dur="5.711">because what were they threatening they</text>
  <text start="608.17" dur="6.99">were threatening sanctions on the</text>
  <text start="610.48" dur="8.37">central bank system so this tells us at</text>
  <text start="615.16" dur="6.33">this point that phase two has begun they</text>
  <text start="618.85" dur="4.979">flex their muscles and they were able to</text>
  <text start="621.49" dur="6.51">have the central bank do what they</text>
  <text start="623.829" dur="6.57">wanted and we can see the pushback from</text>
  <text start="628" dur="4.86">the mainstream media it is already</text>
  <text start="630.399" dur="4.56">started and we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot more</text>
  <text start="632.86" dur="5.76">articles like this they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="634.959" dur="5.49">coming out and as time goes on as we go</text>
  <text start="638.62" dur="4.889">throughout the rest of this year into</text>
  <text start="640.449" dur="6.39">next year it&amp;#39;s going to really</text>
  <text start="643.509" dur="5.52">accelerate because as the economy breaks</text>
  <text start="646.839" dur="4.5">down Trump is going to come out and tell</text>
  <text start="649.029" dur="4.381">everyone that it&amp;#39;s because of the Fed as</text>
