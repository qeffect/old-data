  <text start="122.59" dur="5.46">mainstream media go ahead and start</text>
  <text start="125.83" dur="5.7">pushing their agenda they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="128.05" dur="6.03">counter what is coming this will fail</text>
  <text start="131.53" dur="5.819">the Washington Post is out there saying</text>
  <text start="134.08" dur="6.98">that Trump stock market rally is very</text>
  <text start="137.349" dur="6.291">good but still lags Obama and Clinton</text>
  <text start="141.06" dur="5.709">trying to convince the American people</text>
  <text start="143.64" dur="6.55">that yes the stock market is the gauge</text>

  <text start="150.19" dur="6.48">on in the economy yes the stock market</text>
  <text start="153.099" dur="7.411">is doing well but not as well as Obama</text>
  <text start="156.67" dur="4.55">or Clinton they had a better stock</text>
  <text start="160.51" dur="3.71">market</text>
  <text start="161.22" dur="5.88">rally which means Trump&amp;#39;s economy is</text>
  <text start="164.22" dur="4.85">mediocre now we know that the stock</text>
  <text start="167.1" dur="6.33">market is not the gauge of the economy</text>
  <text start="169.07" dur="6.82">yes it shows how the manipulation of the</text>
  <text start="173.43" dur="4.56">economy is going Trump of the Patriots</text>
  <text start="175.89" dur="4.47">know this they understand how this all</text>
  <text start="177.99" dur="6.39">works this is why Trump said yes I do</text>
  <text start="180.36" dur="6.09">have the magic wand to Obama and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="184.38" dur="5.34">going to see the mainstream media push</text>
  <text start="186.45" dur="5.55">these type of stories and we also</text>
  <text start="189.72" dur="4.35">understand that there is good guys in</text>
  <text start="192" dur="4.89">the Fed and bad guys in the Fed now we</text>
  <text start="194.07" dur="6.36">already had a report come out letting us</text>
  <text start="196.89" dur="6.12">know that terrace had no effect on the</text>
  <text start="200.43" dur="4.35">economy and now we&amp;#39;re seeing other</text>
  <text start="203.01" dur="3.66">reports coming out from different feds</text>
  <text start="204.78" dur="4.2">because we have the New York Fed we have</text>
  <text start="206.67" dur="5.31">the st. Louis Fed and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="208.98" dur="5.82">that the Fed study finds Trump&amp;#39;s tariffs</text>
  <text start="211.98" dur="6.12">completely backfired and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="214.8" dur="6.9">prices increase all over the place now</text>
  <text start="218.1" dur="7.35">remember the central bank system their</text>
  <text start="221.7" dur="7.62">entire system isn&amp;#39;t is designed to have</text>
  <text start="225.45" dur="5.7">inflation why because when you create</text>
  <text start="229.32" dur="4.32">more currency that means there&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="231.15" dur="5.46">dollars in circulation which means the</text>
  <text start="233.64" dur="5.849">value of the dollar decreases the item</text>
  <text start="236.61" dur="5.43">doesn&amp;#39;t move in price the currency</text>
  <text start="239.489" dur="4.651">decreases which means you need more of</text>
  <text start="242.04" dur="4.86">those dollars to buy the same exact</text>
  <text start="244.14" dur="5.49">thing and I remember an article from</text>
  <text start="246.9" dur="5.25">CNBC letting us know that if Trump</text>
  <text start="249.63" dur="4.8">places tariffs on China we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="252.15" dur="5.19">see increases in prices like the iPhone</text>
  <text start="254.43" dur="5.58">and many other products we haven&amp;#39;t seen</text>
  <text start="257.34" dur="5.3">this and what they&amp;#39;re trying to do here</text>
  <text start="260.01" dur="7.05">is they&amp;#39;re trying to make it look like</text>
  <text start="262.64" dur="7.63">the entire economic system is not doing</text>
  <text start="267.06" dur="6.09">well remember they tried all of it they</text>
  <text start="270.27" dur="5.04">tried the recession they tried raising</text>
  <text start="273.15" dur="4.11">the rates with the Fed come up for the</text>
  <text start="275.31" dur="3.69">Patriots reverse this then they try</text>
  <text start="277.26" dur="4.38">putting out articles trying to force</text>
  <text start="279" dur="5.1">people to be afraid to have them panic</text>
  <text start="281.64" dur="3.779">that a recession is headed our way where</text>
  <text start="284.1" dur="3">they would stop spending remember</text>
  <text start="285.419" dur="5.491">spending a 70% of GDP</text>
  <text start="287.1" dur="5.85">we haven&amp;#39;t seen that and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="290.91" dur="4.39">trying to make it seem like Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="292.95" dur="6.85">economy is not work</text>
  <text start="295.3" dur="7.77">well why because we understand what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="299.8" dur="5.13">coming Pina Navarro he discussed that</text>
  <text start="303.07" dur="4.02">the Trump administration trade agenda</text>
  <text start="304.93" dur="5.51">and other things that he&amp;#39;s doing right</text>
  <text start="307.09" dur="6.18">now are going to make the economy boom</text>
  <text start="310.44" dur="4.33">what is he talking about well he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="313.27" dur="5.01">talking about the trade agreements with</text>
  <text start="314.77" dur="5.99">South Korea Japan China phase one the</text>
  <text start="318.28" dur="5.73">u.s. Mexico Canada u.s. MCA agreement</text>
  <text start="320.76" dur="7.24">what they&amp;#39;re going to deliver next year</text>
  <text start="324.01" dur="5.7">and it&amp;#39;s going to blow everything that</text>
  <text start="328" dur="6.06">we know about the economy out of the</text>
  <text start="329.71" dur="7.68">water they&amp;#39;re expecting the stock market</text>
  <text start="334.06" dur="6.98">to hit 32,000 seems a little far off</text>
  <text start="337.39" dur="6.06">right now but really does it not really</text>
  <text start="341.04" dur="6.49">because as we know when the Fed lowers</text>
  <text start="343.45" dur="5.42">rates pushes stimulus well we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="347.53" dur="5.13">see the market move up</text>
  <text start="348.87" dur="7.59">remember the consumer is the anchor for</text>
  <text start="352.66" dur="7.32">the economy and they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="356.46" dur="7.12">GDP numbers increasing now why would</text>
  <text start="359.98" dur="6.66">those numbers increase well if the</text>
  <text start="363.58" dur="6.51">everyday person is receiving a tax</text>
  <text start="366.64" dur="6.09">benefit if wages are moving up in the</text>
  <text start="370.09" dur="5.79">lower and lower middle class area what</text>
  <text start="372.73" dur="6.06">do people do they spend the money if</text>
  <text start="375.88" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re confident in the system how do</text>
  <text start="378.79" dur="3.42">people feel confident the mainstream</text>
  <text start="380.56" dur="3.99">media is gonna report the stock markets</text>
  <text start="382.21" dur="4.85">moving up which in their minds they</text>
  <text start="384.55" dur="5.369">believe that the economy&amp;#39;s doing well</text>
  <text start="387.06" dur="5.62">Trump and the Patriots are using all the</text>
  <text start="389.919" dur="5.601">weapons against them what else is</text>
  <text start="392.68" dur="6.84">happening while we have the trade deals</text>
  <text start="395.52" dur="7">Japan their trade deal is seven billion</text>
  <text start="399.52" dur="6.42">dollars in agricultural trade to help</text>
  <text start="402.52" dur="7.22">the farmers then we have South Korea we</text>
  <text start="405.94" dur="6.93">have Mexico Canada which is the u.s. MCA</text>
  <text start="409.74" dur="6.01">and we also have the China phase one</text>
  <text start="412.87" dur="6.33">deal where we&amp;#39;re gonna hit in one to two</text>
  <text start="415.75" dur="6.06">years from now 200 billion worth of</text>
  <text start="419.2" dur="5.31">trade which a quarter of that is going</text>
  <text start="421.81" dur="3.45">to help the farmer so we have Japan and</text>
  <text start="424.51" dur="3.99">China</text>
  <text start="425.26" dur="6">kicking in and the farmers are going</text>
  <text start="428.5" dur="7.01">to receive the benefit what else does</text>

  <text start="435.51" dur="8.08">manufacturing powerhouse what else does</text>
  <text start="439.24" dur="7.8">it do it&amp;#39;s going to create jobs here in</text>

  <text start="447.04" dur="5.21">media the central bank&amp;#39;s they know this</text>
  <text start="449.32" dur="6.36">they&amp;#39;re trying to counter what is coming</text>
  <text start="452.25" dur="8.08">this was all set up and purposely</text>
  <text start="455.68" dur="7.79">planned to come online in the year 2020</text>
  <text start="460.33" dur="6.589">why would Trump and the Patriots do that</text>
  <text start="463.47" dur="7.03">because they knew they needed all this</text>
  <text start="466.919" dur="6.731">to push the economy to the nth degree</text>
  <text start="470.5" dur="6.93">and this is exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="473.65" dur="6.54">and by doing all this it allows Trump</text>
  <text start="477.43" dur="5.34">and the Patriots to go up against the</text>
  <text start="480.19" dur="5.91">globalists it allows Trump of the</text>
  <text start="482.77" dur="7.38">Patriots the show the Fed has no clue in</text>

  <text start="502.57" dur="8.52">come online when Trump came into office</text>
  <text start="506.77" dur="9.209">until now this was the preparation this</text>
  <text start="511.09" dur="7.77">was the plan put into motion where Trump</text>
  <text start="515.979" dur="6.93">moved all the pieces around and got</text>
  <text start="518.86" dur="8.46">everything prepared for this moment this</text>
  <text start="522.909" dur="8.251">is just phase one of the plan to bring</text>
  <text start="527.32" dur="7.68">the transitional economy online that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="560.62" dur="3.51">wasn&amp;#39;t happening in the United State</text>
  <text start="562.24" dur="3.42">because of environmental laws they put</text>
  <text start="564.13" dur="2.97">this in place so everything would be</text>
  <text start="565.66" dur="4.679">moved over to China because remember</text>
  <text start="567.1" dur="6.2">their plan was to shift everything now</text>
  <text start="570.339" dur="6.241">the United States is energy independent</text>
  <text start="573.3" dur="5.229">we&amp;#39;ll be processing our own rare earth</text>
  <text start="576.58" dur="5.129">minerals why do we need this because</text>
  <text start="578.529" dur="6.691">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s used with technology and</text>

  <text start="621.1" dur="3.06">bank economy and what are the mainstream</text>
  <text start="622.93" dur="3.719">media what are the central banks going</text>
  <text start="624.16" dur="6.36">to do there&amp;#39;s nothing for them to do</text>
  <text start="626.649" dur="8.75">they are trapped by all of this and then</text>
  <text start="630.52" dur="7.89">we have China&amp;#39;s Phase two trade deal and</text>

  <text start="659.73" dur="7.87">16 year election this is about taking</text>
  <text start="664.27" dur="5.97">everything that we had and resetting it</text>
  <text start="667.6" dur="7.53">and bringing the power back to the</text>
