  <text start="183.28" dur="5.52">discussing that in just a bit but</text>

  <text start="188.8" dur="3.9">central bank economy when we talk about</text>
  <text start="190.57" dur="4.92">the economy and we talk about it</text>
  <text start="192.7" dur="6.27">imploding collapsing it&amp;#39;s the old</text>
  <text start="195.49" dur="6.45">economy the old economy is completely</text>
  <text start="198.97" dur="6.72">exposed right now and the mainstream</text>

  <text start="208.33" dur="6.12">with it they&amp;#39;ve never experienced this</text>
  <text start="210.37" dur="6.5">before they didn&amp;#39;t want exposure and</text>
  <text start="214.45" dur="5.22">when you look around you can see</text>
  <text start="216.87" dur="5.62">everywhere you look the central bank</text>
  <text start="219.67" dur="4.32">economy is imploding on itself if you</text>
  <text start="222.49" dur="4.08">look at Europe the European banks</text>
  <text start="223.99" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re quite an under performance doom</text>
  <text start="226.57" dur="4.71">loop actually it kind of looks like</text>
  <text start="228.91" dur="5.16">Lehman Brothers their earnings growth is</text>
  <text start="231.28" dur="5.67">expected to stall this year the eurozone</text>
  <text start="234.07" dur="4.44">economy is slowing again the ECB&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="236.95" dur="3.509">downgrade of the growth outlook this</text>
  <text start="238.51" dur="4.92">month was one of the biggest in years</text>
  <text start="240.459" dur="4.741">while the Bundesbank gave up on a first</text>
  <text start="243.43" dur="5.52">quarter rebound in Germany as the</text>
  <text start="245.2" dur="6.42">nation&amp;#39;s industries tumbled it&amp;#39;s all set</text>
  <text start="248.95" dur="6.12">the stage for low rates into the</text>
  <text start="251.62" dur="8.52">foreseeable future the central banks are</text>
  <text start="255.07" dur="8.28">stuck in a doom loop they can&amp;#39;t get out</text>
  <text start="260.14" dur="6.21">of it because everything they planned on</text>
  <text start="263.35" dur="5.4">went up in smoke they&amp;#39;re not in control</text>
  <text start="266.35" dur="4.62">anymore because if they were in control</text>
  <text start="268.75" dur="4.02">they would have their event they would</text>
  <text start="270.97" dur="6.09">have their cover-up story they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="272.77" dur="7.32">have this so we see the world slowing</text>
  <text start="277.06" dur="5.19">down but not the United States remember</text>
  <text start="280.09" dur="5.579">the United States is the reserve dollar</text>
  <text start="282.25" dur="5.85">the United States controls pretty much</text>
  <text start="285.669" dur="5.491">everything everything is connected to</text>
  <text start="288.1" dur="4.98">the United States Trump the Patriots</text>
  <text start="291.16" dur="5.039">they understand this</text>
  <text start="293.08" dur="5.82">and all they need to do is keep the</text>
  <text start="296.199" dur="6">United States far above everyone else</text>
  <text start="298.9" dur="5.88">and this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="302.199" dur="6.81">while the rest of the central bank</text>
  <text start="304.78" dur="6.09">system implodes yes we do see signs of</text>
  <text start="309.009" dur="3.271">the economy imploding in the United</text>
  <text start="310.87" dur="4.43">States we look at the real estate market</text>
  <text start="312.28" dur="6.419">we look at us core factory orders</text>
  <text start="315.3" dur="5.53">everything is declining and the only</text>
  <text start="318.699" dur="5.641">thing that Trump can continually do is</text>
  <text start="320.83" dur="6.089">he can keep the numbers the deep state</text>
  <text start="324.34" dur="6.18">the central banks have used over many</text>
  <text start="326.919" dur="5.791">many years he can keep them low which is</text>
  <text start="330.52" dur="5.13">unemployment and very high for GDP stock</text>
  <text start="332.71" dur="5.609">market and everything else and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="335.65" dur="4.44">what he&amp;#39;s doing because remember this is</text>
  <text start="338.319" dur="3.931">really all they reported on these were</text>
  <text start="340.09" dur="3.78">their big headlines look at the stock</text>
  <text start="342.25" dur="3.629">market look at the Stockman actually if</text>
  <text start="343.87" dur="4.009">you go back to my reports going back</text>
  <text start="345.879" dur="5.04">many many years one Obama was president</text>
  <text start="347.879" dur="4.481">that was their plan they wanted everyone</text>
  <text start="350.919" dur="3.571">looking at the stock market they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="352.36" dur="4.29">want everyone looking at the real</text>
  <text start="354.49" dur="4.079">numbers where we look at real</text>
  <text start="356.65" dur="4.049">unemployment where we show a lot of</text>
  <text start="358.569" dur="3.96">people have fallen off unemployment and</text>
  <text start="360.699" dur="5.071">we explain why and how they manipulated</text>
  <text start="362.529" dur="5.13">the calculation GDP how during Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="365.77" dur="3.54">reign they went all the way back to 1929</text>
  <text start="367.659" dur="5.07">included research and development and</text>
  <text start="369.31" dur="5.849">recalculated GDP moving forward how they</text>
  <text start="372.729" dur="5.611">were manipulating the stock market by</text>
  <text start="375.159" dur="5.07">having other central banks buy stocks</text>
  <text start="378.34" dur="3.689">where they created the currency out of</text>
  <text start="380.229" dur="4.231">thin air and they went in they purchase</text>
  <text start="382.029" dur="4.531">stocks they didn&amp;#39;t want you looking at</text>
  <text start="384.46" dur="3.15">all that they wanted you to look at the</text>
  <text start="386.56" dur="2.46">unemployment numbers that they</text>
  <text start="387.61" dur="3.839">manipulated the GDP numbers that they</text>
  <text start="389.02" dur="5.759">manipulated and the stock market and</text>
  <text start="391.449" dur="5.94">isn&amp;#39;t this what he is doing he&amp;#39;s using</text>
  <text start="394.779" dur="7.651">this against them while he works on the</text>
  <text start="397.389" dur="7.5">back end he&amp;#39;s preparing the country for</text>
  <text start="402.43" dur="4.799">a transition now a lot of people look at</text>
  <text start="404.889" dur="5.25">this angle he can never bring back all</text>
  <text start="407.229" dur="6.451">the manufacturing we can&amp;#39;t have a system</text>
  <text start="410.139" dur="4.981">where we&amp;#39;re producing goods and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="413.68" dur="3.66">shipping them out to the rest of the</text>
  <text start="415.12" dur="4.409">world no not in a central bank system</text>
  <text start="417.34" dur="5.009">remember for many many years they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="419.529" dur="4.881">been offshoring companies manufacturing</text>
  <text start="422.349" dur="5.931">and everything else</text>
  <text start="424.41" dur="6.24">he needs to bring back a small base so</text>
  <text start="428.28" dur="4.08">the United States can survive he also</text>
  <text start="430.65" dur="3.39">needs to get rid of all the trade deals</text>
  <text start="432.36" dur="4.32">which he&amp;#39;s been doing the globalist</text>
  <text start="434.04" dur="5.85">trade deals he also has to set the stage</text>
  <text start="436.68" dur="6.78">where he needs to deregulate and he</text>
  <text start="439.89" dur="7.83">needs to cut expenses and he needs to</text>
  <text start="443.46" dur="7.38">stop the debt model so already we see</text>
  <text start="447.72" dur="5.43">Trump the administration they pushed out</text>
  <text start="450.84" dur="5.73">goals for modernizing the Higher</text>
  <text start="453.15" dur="6.54">Education Act including a proposed cap</text>
  <text start="456.57" dur="5.55">on student loan borrowing as we know</text>
  <text start="459.69" dur="4.53">today most of the Millennials have</text>
  <text start="462.12" dur="4.86">trillions and trillions of dollars in</text>
  <text start="464.22" dur="4.7">student loans because they were sold a</text>
  <text start="466.98" dur="4.92">bill of goods that if you go to college</text>
  <text start="468.92" dur="5.8">you&amp;#39;ll get a great job and don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="471.9" dur="5.88">about the debt well what they found out</text>
  <text start="474.72" dur="7.47">was I went to college I didn&amp;#39;t find a</text>
  <text start="477.78" dur="6.78">great job and I have a lot of debt so</text>
  <text start="482.19" dur="4.89">right now the National Council for the</text>
  <text start="484.56" dur="4.23">American worker released a set of white</text>
  <text start="487.08" dur="3.93">house proposals to reform the Higher</text>
  <text start="488.79" dur="4.68">Education Act to create a more</text>
  <text start="491.01" dur="4.23">innovative and demand-driven system that</text>
  <text start="493.47" dur="5.16">is responsive to students workers</text>
  <text start="495.24" dur="5.01">employers and taxpayers this is just the</text>
  <text start="498.63" dur="4.14">beginning stages and they want to put a</text>
  <text start="500.25" dur="5.37">cap on how much someone can take out</text>
  <text start="502.77" dur="6.09">because as we can see today people are</text>
  <text start="505.62" dur="7.14">so far into debt it&amp;#39;s an absolutely</text>
  <text start="508.86" dur="7.77">ridiculous and we need to stop it and</text>
  <text start="512.76" dur="8.04">you need to slow the pace of student</text>
  <text start="516.63" dur="5.789">loan debt down now is this a fix all for</text>
  <text start="520.8" dur="6.17">everything absolutely not</text>
  <text start="522.419" dur="8.191">this is the beginning stages why are</text>
  <text start="526.97" dur="6.46">colleges so expensive think about what</text>
  <text start="530.61" dur="6.18">the central bank has done anything that</text>
  <text start="533.43" dur="7.95">is attached to a loan where you have to</text>
  <text start="536.79" dur="10.17">borrow the central bank makes it where</text>
  <text start="541.38" dur="7.8">the prices of those items move up think</text>
  <text start="546.96" dur="5.22">about it for a second you need to go</text>
  <text start="549.18" dur="5.82">purchase a house well you need to take</text>
  <text start="552.18" dur="6.029">out a mortgage they can raise they can</text>
  <text start="555" dur="6.72">actually stuff the inflation into</text>
  <text start="558.209" dur="6.36">housing because they know that no one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="561.72" dur="4.799">going to use their own currency they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="564.569" dur="4.8">gonna have to take out a loan if you go</text>
  <text start="566.519" dur="4.56">into college what they do they make</text>
  <text start="569.369" dur="3.871">college very expensive they stuff the</text>
  <text start="571.079" dur="3.781">inflation into there because they knew</text>
  <text start="573.24" dur="5.029">if you wanted to go to college you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="574.86" dur="6.149">take out a loan you&amp;#39;ll have to borrow if</text>
  <text start="578.269" dur="4.87">you look at anything like a car</text>
  <text start="581.009" dur="3.63">same thing you&amp;#39;re going to borrow you</text>
  <text start="583.139" dur="6.24">can&amp;#39;t afford it they stuff it into that</text>
  <text start="584.639" dur="7.86">and what they did was they stuffed the</text>
  <text start="589.379" dur="6.75">inflation into certain areas where</text>
  <text start="592.499" dur="7.02">people didn&amp;#39;t use their own currency</text>
  <text start="596.129" dur="5.24">instead you went into debt further debt</text>
  <text start="599.519" dur="4.591">than ever before</text>
  <text start="601.369" dur="6.31">remember the product of the central bank</text>
  <text start="604.11" dur="5.099">is debt they love debt now we hear the</text>
  <text start="607.679" dur="4.801">mainstream media out there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="609.209" dur="4.8">talking about tariffs and how Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="612.48" dur="4.109">tariffs are gonna make things really</text>
  <text start="614.009" dur="5.19">really expensive well that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="616.589" dur="4.381">necessarily true what is the big reason</text>
  <text start="619.199" dur="4.591">why so many Americans oppose tariffs</text>
  <text start="620.97" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s because many people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="623.79" dur="4.139">understand them this is out of the</text>
  <text start="625.74" dur="5.55">national economics editorial they</text>
  <text start="627.929" dur="5.611">explained it many Americans are hearing</text>
  <text start="631.29" dur="4.229">towers from the mainstream media they</text>
  <text start="633.54" dur="5.669">think tariffs are just another sales tax</text>
  <text start="635.519" dur="6.3">and assume that imposing a 10% tariff on</text>
  <text start="639.209" dur="6.271">a product will increase said product</text>
  <text start="641.819" dur="5.031">price by 10% well the problem is that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="645.48" dur="5.43">not how it works</text>
  <text start="646.85" dur="6.099">unlike sales taxes American tariffs are</text>
  <text start="650.91" dur="4.349">not applied to a products retail price</text>
  <text start="652.949" dur="4.44">nor are they applied to the wholesale</text>
  <text start="655.259" dur="5.07">price in fact they&amp;#39;re often not even</text>
  <text start="657.389" dur="6.12">levied on the entire import price</text>
  <text start="660.329" dur="5.97">instead tariffs are levied on the first</text>
  <text start="663.509" dur="5.79">sale price the price paid to the foreign</text>
  <text start="666.299" dur="5.85">vendors by American companies or their</text>
  <text start="669.299" dur="5.551">middlemen this method of calculation</text>
  <text start="672.149" dur="5.79">reduces that tax burden on American</text>
  <text start="674.85" dur="5.76">consumers but preserves the tariffs</text>
  <text start="677.939" dur="6.031">punitive effect unform producers for</text>
