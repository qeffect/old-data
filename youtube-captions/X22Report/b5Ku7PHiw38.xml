  <text start="122.92" dur="3.33">everything that was put into place is</text>
  <text start="124.42" dur="4.02">now being rolled back what I mean by</text>
  <text start="126.25" dur="4.89">that is that central bankers the deep</text>

  <text start="133.329" dur="4.801">starting to see a lot of it being rolled</text>
  <text start="135.489" dur="5.521">back and we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot more of</text>
  <text start="138.13" dur="5.31">this because why the Trump</text>
  <text start="141.01" dur="5.43">administration the Patriots they need to</text>
  <text start="143.44" dur="6.18">prepare the United States for what comes</text>
  <text start="146.44" dur="5.46">after the central bank remember</text>
  <text start="149.62" dur="5.339">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been seeing all up</text>
  <text start="151.9" dur="5.82">to this point has been the central bank</text>
  <text start="154.959" dur="3.961">economy they were preparing the United</text>
  <text start="157.72" dur="2.01">States for something completely</text>
  <text start="158.92" dur="3.599">different</text>
  <text start="159.73" dur="5">what has to be done right now everything</text>
  <text start="162.519" dur="4.55">has to be unraveled</text>
  <text start="164.73" dur="3.45">they did this on purpose on when I say</text>
  <text start="167.069" dur="3.09">they I&amp;#39;m talking about the deep state</text>
  <text start="168.18" dur="4.11">the central banks they put all these</text>
  <text start="170.159" dur="3.871">regulations in place they made it</text>
  <text start="172.29" dur="2.309">impossible for business to do business</text>
  <text start="174.03" dur="1.86">here</text>
  <text start="174.599" dur="3.301">they made it impossible for</text>
  <text start="175.89" dur="4.53">manufacturing to stay in the United</text>
  <text start="177.9" dur="6.479">States all of this was being done on</text>
  <text start="180.42" dur="7.08">purpose and now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="184.379" dur="5.64">everything is being removed yes it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="187.5" dur="5.25">going as fast as everyone would like but</text>
  <text start="190.019" dur="4.08">a lot of it&amp;#39;s being removed and the</text>
  <text start="192.75" dur="3.42">central bank the deep state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="194.099" dur="5.67">gonna fight because we have good guys</text>
  <text start="196.17" dur="6.209">and bats bad guys intermixed within</text>
  <text start="199.769" dur="5.571">these organizations but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="202.379" dur="5">seeing is that the good guys they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="205.34" dur="4.539">starting to have the upper hand here</text>
  <text start="207.379" dur="4.661">they&amp;#39;re starting to push back and push</text>
  <text start="209.879" dur="4.5">back hard and they&amp;#39;re getting their way</text>
  <text start="212.04" dur="4.979">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see a rollback of</text>
  <text start="214.379" dur="3.961">a lot of these regulations a lot of</text>
  <text start="217.019" dur="4.381">these ridiculous tests that are</text>
  <text start="218.34" dur="5.64">absolutely meaningless all of this is</text>
  <text start="221.4" dur="6.149">being thrown out the window right now</text>
  <text start="223.98" dur="5.64">and the reason for it is so the central</text>
  <text start="227.549" dur="4.861">bank the deep state can be exposed and</text>
  <text start="229.62" dur="5.67">to prepare the United States for what</text>
  <text start="232.41" dur="5.579">comes later and with what I mean by that</text>
  <text start="235.29" dur="5.94">is that what comes later is a new</text>
  <text start="237.989" dur="5.881">economic system but when we look around</text>
  <text start="241.23" dur="5.4">the entire world here we see the</text>
  <text start="243.87" dur="5.839">economic system it is breaking down and</text>
  <text start="246.63" dur="6.719">this is the global central bank system</text>
  <text start="249.709" dur="6.041">they knew it could not last past a</text>
  <text start="253.349" dur="3.901">certain period of time they knew that it</text>
  <text start="255.75" dur="4.2">would start to break down and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="257.25" dur="5.07">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now up in Canada</text>
  <text start="259.95" dur="5.16">we know that they&amp;#39;re in a major housing</text>
  <text start="262.32" dur="4.89">bubble and that thing well it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="265.11" dur="3.9">pop and it&amp;#39;s going to be a complete and</text>
  <text start="267.21" dur="4.8">utter disaster right now Canadian</text>
  <text start="269.01" dur="6.42">mortgage credit growth is falling how</text>
  <text start="272.01" dur="6.33">bad is it in real terms well people are</text>
  <text start="275.43" dur="6.29">comparing today&amp;#39;s low growth numbers to</text>
  <text start="278.34" dur="5.85">the mid 90s now there are some parallels</text>
  <text start="281.72" dur="5.53">but it more accurately resembles the</text>
  <text start="284.19" dur="4.47">early 80s mortgage credit growth when</text>
  <text start="287.25" dur="3.96">adjusted for inflation is heading</text>
  <text start="288.66" dur="4.83">towards negative numbers we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="291.21" dur="6.3">actually experienced the negative real</text>
  <text start="293.49" dur="5.79">growth yet but it&amp;#39;s coming now Canady</text>
  <text start="297.51" dur="5.25">mortgage credit growth is pretty weak</text>
  <text start="299.28" dur="6.06">when looking at unadjusted numbers the</text>
  <text start="302.76" dur="4.98">annual pace of growth fell to 3.4</text>
  <text start="305.34" dur="5.16">percent in September down 38 percent</text>
  <text start="307.74" dur="6.93">yes that&amp;#39;s 38 percent from last year</text>
  <text start="310.5" dur="6.06">this is the lowest pace since June 2001</text>
  <text start="314.67" dur="5.7">and on target to head lower</text>
  <text start="316.56" dur="7.34">according to recent performance it&amp;#39;s low</text>
  <text start="320.37" dur="8.94">growth remember what happened back in</text>
  <text start="323.9" dur="8.38">2008 and 2009 where we saw Canadian</text>
  <text start="329.31" dur="5.55">mortgage credit growth decline we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="332.28" dur="6.87">already past that point we&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="334.86" dur="9.69">very close to the 2001 point so when you</text>
  <text start="339.15" dur="9.21">take the mortgage credit growth and you</text>
  <text start="344.55" dur="5.33">adjust it for inflation the picture gets</text>
  <text start="348.36" dur="5.01">a little bit more dreary for lenders</text>
  <text start="349.88" dur="7.15">real mortgage credit is at a 1.1 4</text>
  <text start="353.37" dur="6.99">percent growth in September 71 percent</text>
  <text start="357.03" dur="5.31">lower than last year the rate is falling</text>
  <text start="360.36" dur="5.58">at nearly twice the pace most people are</text>
  <text start="362.34" dur="7.41">expecting real credit growth has hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="365.94" dur="7.05">been this low again since o 1 it is a</text>
  <text start="369.75" dur="6.99">complete and utter disaster and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="372.99" dur="5.88">likely to turn negative I mean this does</text>
  <text start="376.74" dur="4.62">not look good whatsoever if we look at</text>
  <text start="378.87" dur="5.94">caterpillar now we talked about</text>
  <text start="381.36" dur="6.96">caterpillar quite a bit during the Obama</text>
  <text start="384.81" dur="6.27">reign and the sales for caterpillar they</text>
  <text start="388.32" dur="5.37">were a complete and utter disaster sales</text>
  <text start="391.08" dur="4.56">started to pick up for caterpillar when</text>
  <text start="393.69" dur="5.01">Trump came into office and this was done</text>
  <text start="395.64" dur="4.62">through manipulation allowing countries</text>
  <text start="398.7" dur="2.55">to feel like everything is getting</text>
  <text start="400.26" dur="3.69">better especially here in the United</text>
  <text start="401.25" dur="5.93">States but what we&amp;#39;re seeing once again</text>
  <text start="403.95" dur="6.57">is that sales are starting to drop</text>
  <text start="407.18" dur="6.46">remember what happened here was a</text>
  <text start="410.52" dur="4.62">temporary fix this wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to be</text>
  <text start="413.64" dur="2.82">a permanent fix for all these</text>
  <text start="415.14" dur="3.96">corporations for the people of the</text>
  <text start="416.46" dur="4.32">United States it was to allow the system</text>
  <text start="419.1" dur="4.5">to go a little bit longer to get</text>
  <text start="420.78" dur="6.69">everything in place and guess what roll</text>
  <text start="423.6" dur="6">back all the regulations and roll back</text>
  <text start="427.47" dur="3.96">as much as you possibly can before the</text>
  <text start="429.6" dur="5.46">entire system implodes</text>
  <text start="431.43" dur="5.7">now we know gold has been manipulated</text>
  <text start="435.06" dur="5.19">for a very long time and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="437.13" dur="4.92">going back many many years said there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="440.25" dur="3.72">a conspiracy theory gold does not</text>
  <text start="442.05" dur="4.92">manipulate it this is the real price of</text>
  <text start="443.97" dur="6.419">gold well no we now know that it is</text>
  <text start="446.97" dur="6.419">manipulated actually a JP Morgan Chase</text>
  <text start="450.389" dur="6.481">trader pled guilty to gold manipulation</text>
  <text start="453.389" dur="7.381">this trader turned state&amp;#39;s evidence</text>
  <text start="456.87" dur="8.13">so gold and silver investors got some</text>
  <text start="460.77" dur="6.54">good news that the conspiracy is no more</text>
  <text start="465" dur="4.5">and we&amp;#39;ve known this with silver and</text>
  <text start="467.31" dur="3.96">many port many more people are going to</text>
  <text start="469.5" dur="3.8">get caught on this but the real</text>
  <text start="471.27" dur="5.399">manipulation comes from the central bank</text>
  <text start="473.3" dur="5.739">these are just the you know outliers the</text>
  <text start="476.669" dur="5.22">the people that are manipulating that</text>
  <text start="479.039" dur="5.761">really can affect it but not like the</text>
  <text start="481.889" dur="5.46">central bank now John Edmonds admitted</text>
  <text start="484.8" dur="5.28">to cheating the banks clients and plenty</text>
  <text start="487.349" dur="5.13">of other people naive enough to expect</text>
  <text start="490.08" dur="6.54">fair treatment on the comics and other</text>
  <text start="492.479" dur="6.151">exchanges mr. Edmonds is ratting out</text>
  <text start="496.62" dur="6.62">some fellow traders this is just not a</text>
  <text start="498.63" dur="8.159">one person scam it&amp;#39;s many people</text>
  <text start="503.24" dur="7.57">together including senior traders there</text>
  <text start="506.789" dur="6.18">are also immediate supervisors so what</text>
  <text start="510.81" dur="4.529">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that this is</text>
  <text start="512.969" dur="5.25">just not a rogue individual a one-off</text>
  <text start="515.339" dur="4.95">player this has many people working</text>
  <text start="518.219" dur="4.94">together to manipulate just like when</text>
  <text start="520.289" dur="5.161">they manipulated the LIBOR interest rate</text>
  <text start="523.159" dur="4.271">and we know that they throw tons of</text>
  <text start="525.45" dur="5.759">paper contracts at gold to bring the</text>
  <text start="527.43" dur="6.42">price down and we know that the true</text>
  <text start="531.209" dur="5.641">price of gold the way the dollar is</text>
  <text start="533.85" dur="6.98">today would be much much higher because</text>
  <text start="536.85" dur="7.44">the dollar has lost 98% of its value</text>
  <text start="540.83" dur="5.71">when the central banks lose complete</text>
  <text start="544.29" dur="4.23">control of the system they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="546.54" dur="3.11">to worry about gold they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="548.52" dur="3.09">be worrying about the manipulation</text>
  <text start="549.65" dur="3.309">they&amp;#39;re going to be trying to hold</text>
  <text start="551.61" dur="3.72">everything together and I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="552.959" dur="4.411">about the bad guys in the Fed especially</text>
  <text start="555.33" dur="5.43">the Rothschilds the upper central banks</text>
  <text start="557.37" dur="6.05">they don&amp;#39;t want the central bank to be</text>
  <text start="560.76" dur="4.59">responsible for a system coming down why</text>
  <text start="563.42" dur="3.58">because then</text>
  <text start="565.35" dur="3.21">another central bank or private central</text>
  <text start="567" dur="3.69">bank will be blamed then another one</text>
  <text start="568.56" dur="4.23">will be blamed and then before you know</text>
  <text start="570.69" dur="3.03">it people will be looking at the same</text>
  <text start="572.79" dur="3.24">we&amp;#39;ll wait a minute</text>
  <text start="573.72" dur="5.04">does this system really work why would</text>
  <text start="576.03" dur="4.34">it be crashing right now the whole point</text>
  <text start="578.76" dur="6.12">of the private western central bank is</text>
  <text start="580.37" dur="6.07">to help the system so people can prosper</text>
  <text start="584.88" dur="4.53">but we know this is not really what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="586.44" dur="5.43">happening here we know that the central</text>
  <text start="589.41" dur="5.25">bank is a private corporation and they</text>
  <text start="591.87" dur="4.89">do everything for themselves now like I</text>
  <text start="594.66" dur="3.57">said in the beginning a lot of the</text>
  <text start="596.76" dur="4.14">regulations are starting to be rolled</text>
  <text start="598.23" dur="5.37">back TPP you name it they&amp;#39;re rolling</text>
  <text start="600.9" dur="4.62">back taxes regulations and you have to</text>
  <text start="603.6" dur="4.17">because these regulations and everything</text>
  <text start="605.52" dur="3.54">was put in place to force companies out</text>
  <text start="607.77" dur="3.3">of the United States remember they had a</text>
  <text start="609.06" dur="3.9">completely different plan before Trent</text>
  <text start="611.07" dur="4.95">Trump came into office before the</text>
  <text start="612.96" dur="5.1">Patriots were in office so their plan</text>
  <text start="616.02" dur="2.97">was completely different to reverse</text>
  <text start="618.06" dur="3.24">everything right now</text>
  <text start="618.99" dur="4.38">well it takes a little bit of work and</text>
  <text start="621.3" dur="5.73">you need key players in certain</text>
  <text start="623.37" dur="5.97">positions and we know that q did mention</text>
  <text start="627.03" dur="4.71">right in the very beginning and listed</text>
  <text start="629.34" dur="4.32">all the different banks and said these</text>
  <text start="631.74" dur="3.51">are the Rothschilds banks and they were</text>
  <text start="633.66" dur="4.2">all around the world in almost every</text>
  <text start="635.25" dur="5.46">single country and I think what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="637.86" dur="6.12">happening right now is countries the big</text>
  <text start="640.71" dur="7.02">ones China Russia the US and there are</text>
  <text start="643.98" dur="6">some outlying smaller countries that</text>
  <text start="647.73" dur="5.58">will get in on this and eventually when</text>
