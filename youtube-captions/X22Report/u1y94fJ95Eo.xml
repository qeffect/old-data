  <text start="32.369" dur="5.221">today&amp;#39;s date is februari 14 2014 and the</text>
  <text start="35.489" dur="3.931">title this episode is Americans have</text>
  <text start="37.59" dur="4.26">lost hope as the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="39.42" dur="3.51">accelerates before I get started I just</text>
  <text start="41.85" dur="2.79">want to wish those people who are</text>
  <text start="42.93" dur="3.809">celebrating Valentine&amp;#39;s Day happy</text>
  <text start="44.64" dur="4.129">Valentine&amp;#39;s Day and we&amp;#39;re going to get</text>
  <text start="46.739" dur="4.831">right into the economic collapse news</text>
  <text start="48.769" dur="4.451">we&amp;#39;re going to head out to Cyprus and a</text>
  <text start="51.57" dur="3.12">couple of reports ago I reported that</text>
  <text start="53.22" dur="4.65">Cyprus was going to ease restrictions</text>
  <text start="54.69" dur="4.679">and remove the capital controls now it</text>
  <text start="57.87" dur="3.99">seems like they&amp;#39;re backpedaling a little</text>
  <text start="59.369" dur="4.65">bit and right now a report came out</text>
  <text start="61.86" dur="5.369">saying that the Cyprus Central Bank</text>
  <text start="64.019" dur="5.191">chief says he expects all restrictions</text>
  <text start="67.229" dur="4.46">on bank money transfers and withdrawals</text>
  <text start="69.21" dur="5.159">to be lifted by the end of the year and</text>
  <text start="71.689" dur="5.17">you know getting rid of all restrictions</text>
  <text start="74.369" dur="4.53">including unlimited money transfers</text>
  <text start="76.859" dur="4.141">abroad depends on confidence being fully</text>
  <text start="78.899" dur="3.33">restored in the banking system and on</text>
  <text start="81" dur="3.42">the government making substantial</text>
  <text start="82.229" dur="5.67">progress in implementing the country&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="84.42" dur="6.119">rescue program so right now it seems</text>
  <text start="87.899" dur="4.771">like they&amp;#39;re struggling because they</text>
  <text start="90.539" dur="4.44">want to make sure that people don&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="92.67" dur="4.29">a run on the banks and it looks like</text>
  <text start="94.979" dur="4.291">they&amp;#39;re going to start removing the</text>
  <text start="96.96" dur="5.789">capital controls but very slowly over</text>
  <text start="99.27" dur="5.19">this entire year now just I think it was</text>
  <text start="102.749" dur="3.841">like a week ago they said they were</text>
  <text start="104.46" dur="4.68">going to remove capital controls next</text>
  <text start="106.59" dur="4.519">week and we&amp;#39;ve seen this before we saw</text>
  <text start="109.14" dur="5.219">it back in 2013 where they said oh</text>
  <text start="111.109" dur="4.96">capital controls in one week and not two</text>
  <text start="114.359" dur="2.851">more we fell just a month and now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="116.069" dur="3.54">been a year and they&amp;#39;re doing the same</text>
  <text start="117.21" dur="5.519">exact thing because their biggest worry</text>
  <text start="119.609" dur="5.4">is that people are going to run and</text>
  <text start="122.729" dur="3.93">start to take their money out of the</text>
  <text start="125.009" dur="3.121">banks and if that happens the whole</text>
  <text start="126.659" dur="3.151">system starts to collapse and you have a</text>
  <text start="128.13" dur="3.99">bank run and of course if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="129.81" dur="6.209">have cash in there you have rioting and</text>
  <text start="132.12" dur="5.85">they&amp;#39;re trying to stop this and they</text>
  <text start="136.019" dur="4.031">know it&amp;#39;s going to happen and this is</text>
  <text start="137.97" dur="4.66">why they&amp;#39;ve been putting it off</text>
  <text start="140.05" dur="4.29">now we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this plays out</text>
  <text start="142.63" dur="4.44">but this is going to be a very difficult</text>
  <text start="144.34" dur="5.43">situation because as soon as they lift</text>
  <text start="147.07" dur="4.86">one restriction people are going to run</text>
  <text start="149.77" dur="3.75">and say all right I can transfer money</text>
  <text start="151.93" dur="3.48">I&amp;#39;m transferring my money out of the</text>
  <text start="153.52" dur="4.2">bank and you know oh I&amp;#39;m a lot of</text>
  <text start="155.41" dur="4.08">transfer a certain amount that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="157.72" dur="3.57">transferring that certain amount or I</text>
  <text start="159.49" dur="3.45">can take out you know ten thousand</text>
  <text start="161.29" dur="2.97">dollars on the bank guess what I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="162.94" dur="3.06">to the bank and I&amp;#39;m taking ten thousand</text>
  <text start="164.26" dur="3.54">dollars out and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="166" dur="3.42">starting to backpedal now now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="167.8" dur="4.53">changing it a little bit because they</text>
  <text start="169.42" dur="6.39">were worried that there will be bank</text>
  <text start="172.33" dur="5.37">runs because i know for me if they told</text>
  <text start="175.81" dur="3.03">me they&amp;#39;re easing restrictions and i can</text>
  <text start="177.7" dur="3.48">go to the bank and get my money out</text>
  <text start="178.84" dur="4.95">guess what i&amp;#39;m doing i&amp;#39;m run to the bank</text>
  <text start="181.18" dur="6.51">and i&amp;#39;m getting my money out that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="183.79" dur="6.87">I&amp;#39;d be doing now in the eurozone in</text>
  <text start="187.69" dur="4.35">Germany we understand that you know</text>
  <text start="190.66" dur="3.09">everyone believes that Germany is very</text>
  <text start="192.04" dur="4.05">strong but what what they&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="193.75" dur="4.92">right now is that Germany is having a</text>
  <text start="196.09" dur="7.68">very tough time the growth in Germany</text>
  <text start="198.67" dur="7.68">has been slowing in 2012 Germany&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="203.77" dur="6.27">growth slowed to about point seven</text>
  <text start="206.35" dur="6.69">percent and now in 2013 growth has</text>
  <text start="210.04" dur="4.98">slowed down two-point-four percent so</text>
  <text start="213.04" dur="4.44">things are not getting better in Germany</text>
  <text start="215.02" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re actually getting worse and you</text>
  <text start="217.48" dur="3.87">know we&amp;#39;ve seen this throughout the</text>
  <text start="218.8" dur="5.939">eurozone eurozone is not doing well high</text>
  <text start="221.35" dur="5.55">unemployment huge debts and Astor</text>
  <text start="224.739" dur="5.011">austerity and a lot of the countries and</text>
  <text start="226.9" dur="7.71">it&amp;#39;s just getting worse and worse as</text>
  <text start="229.75" dur="6.69">time goes on now here back in the United</text>
  <text start="234.61" dur="3.66">States what we&amp;#39;re saying is that things</text>
  <text start="236.44" dur="3.6">aren&amp;#39;t getting better either the only</text>
  <text start="238.27" dur="3.9">difference is they&amp;#39;ve manipulated the</text>
  <text start="240.04" dur="4.47">muck the numbers so much that people</text>
  <text start="242.17" dur="3.93">don&amp;#39;t even know what&amp;#39;s true anymore but</text>
  <text start="244.51" dur="3.54">if you look past all these manipulative</text>
  <text start="246.1" dur="3.87">numbers you can actually see what is</text>
  <text start="248.05" dur="3.21">actually going on here and of course if</text>
  <text start="249.97" dur="3.51">you just keep looking at the stock</text>
  <text start="251.26" dur="3.87">market you&amp;#39;ll think everything is okay</text>
  <text start="253.48" dur="3">and everything&amp;#39;s fine because you know</text>
  <text start="255.13" dur="3">one day the stock market goes down a</text>
  <text start="256.48" dur="3.479">little bit then it goes back up 107</text>
  <text start="258.13" dur="3.87">points like today comes down a little</text>
  <text start="259.959" dur="3.901">bit goes back up and people think that</text>
  <text start="262" dur="3.57">oh that&amp;#39;s the sign of the economy so</text>
  <text start="263.86" dur="4.05">everything is going well but actually</text>
  <text start="265.57" dur="4.349">the stock market is the last indicator</text>
  <text start="267.91" dur="4.2">of the economy everything happens</text>
  <text start="269.919" dur="3.841">beforehand and then when everything else</text>
  <text start="272.11" dur="3.81">just freezes up can</text>
  <text start="273.76" dur="3.87">move forward guess what happens the</text>
  <text start="275.92" dur="2.75">market just comes crumbling down and</text>
  <text start="277.63" dur="4.2">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="278.67" dur="4.93">things are just getting worse and what</text>
  <text start="281.83" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;re seeing is the industrial</text>
  <text start="283.6" dur="3.81">production has plunged again and of</text>
  <text start="285.64" dur="4.92">course they&amp;#39;re blaming this on the</text>
  <text start="287.41" dur="4.62">weather and this is the worst miss and</text>
  <text start="290.56" dur="4.26">the biggest drop in industrial</text>
  <text start="292.03" dur="4.62">production since August of 2012 the</text>
  <text start="294.82" dur="4.68">industrial production decreased by 0.3%</text>
  <text start="296.65" dur="5.16">in January after having risen around</text>
  <text start="299.5" dur="4.47">point three percent in December and in</text>
  <text start="301.81" dur="5.28">January manufacturing output fell around</text>
  <text start="303.97" dur="5.55">eight point eight percent partly because</text>
  <text start="307.09" dur="4.02">of the severe weather and of course they</text>
  <text start="309.52" dur="4.05">always blame every time there&amp;#39;s a drop</text>
  <text start="311.11" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s the weather if things went up and</text>
  <text start="313.57" dur="3.39">it was bad weather they wouldn&amp;#39;t blame</text>
  <text start="315.16" dur="7.35">it on the weather but they always use</text>
  <text start="316.96" dur="7.98">the weather when something decreases now</text>
  <text start="322.51" dur="4.53">what else are we seeing and what other</text>
  <text start="324.94" dur="5.22">signs are we saying that the economy is</text>
  <text start="327.04" dur="5.88">not doing well well we understand that</text>
  <text start="330.16" dur="5.34">retail sales have been down and what</text>
  <text start="332.92" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is US consumer</text>
  <text start="335.5" dur="4.65">spending has dropped for the second</text>
  <text start="337.78" dur="3.93">consecutive month consumer spending in</text>
  <text start="340.15" dur="5.12">the United States dropped sharply in</text>
  <text start="341.71" dur="6.6">January by the most since June of 2012</text>
  <text start="345.27" dur="4.66">signaling a slowdown in the economic</text>
  <text start="348.31" dur="4.38">growth and we understand why this is</text>
  <text start="349.93" dur="6.51">happening it&amp;#39;s completely it&amp;#39;s common</text>
  <text start="352.69" dur="5.82">sense people don&amp;#39;t have jobs the real</text>
  <text start="356.44" dur="3.48">unemployment rate is not six point six</text>
  <text start="358.51" dur="4.26">percent because that has been</text>
  <text start="359.92" dur="5.04">manipulated and changed and revised and</text>
  <text start="362.77" dur="4.47">if you go back to nineteen ninety four</text>
  <text start="364.96" dur="5.01">when they changed at all and moving</text>
  <text start="367.24" dur="4.2">forward just like GDP and inflation they</text>
  <text start="369.97" dur="3.96">completely changed all that information</text>
  <text start="371.44" dur="4.53">the way they calculate it but if you</text>
  <text start="373.93" dur="4.38">really look at it the unemployment is</text>
  <text start="375.97" dur="3.78">probably around thirty percent or so at</text>
  <text start="378.31" dur="3.63">this time it all depends on the</text>
  <text start="379.75" dur="3.78">calculation that you use if you look at</text>
  <text start="381.94" dur="3.99">shadow stats it&amp;#39;s approaching thirty</text>
  <text start="383.53" dur="5.16">percent and at this time and what</text>
  <text start="385.93" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re seeing is is that you know since</text>
  <text start="388.69" dur="3.84">people do not have work right now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="391.24" dur="5.04">what we&amp;#39;re seeing they&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="392.53" dur="5.85">you know things are fine retail sales</text>
  <text start="396.28" dur="4.59">are declining people do not have</text>
  <text start="398.38" dur="5.46">disposable income and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="400.87" dur="5.94">are underemployed and we see this and</text>
  <text start="403.84" dur="3.78">the evidence is that retail sales and</text>
  <text start="406.81" dur="2.79">the amount of money</text>
  <text start="407.62" dur="4.2">that people have in their savings and</text>
  <text start="409.6" dur="4.8">the amount of money that they have on to</text>
  <text start="411.82" dur="5.099">use on spending has completely dropped</text>
  <text start="414.4" dur="5.28">and we are definitely seeing this and</text>
  <text start="416.919" dur="5.551">this goes on to say it&amp;#39;s not looking</text>
  <text start="419.68" dur="5.85">good for consumer spending set Geiberger</text>
  <text start="422.47" dur="4.89">a US economist a top sales forecaster at</text>
  <text start="425.53" dur="7.53">rbs securities in Stanford Connecticut</text>
  <text start="427.36" dur="7.559">things are getting worse and again let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="433.06" dur="3.54">we understand the unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="434.919" dur="3.75">because you know they give it to a six</text>
  <text start="436.6" dur="3.42">point six percent then we have myself</text>
  <text start="438.669" dur="3.211">out there and other people saying that</text>
  <text start="440.02" dur="4.41">no those are manipulated numbers and</text>
  <text start="441.88" dur="3.599">those aren&amp;#39;t the true numbers but no one</text>
  <text start="444.43" dur="4.95">ever really talks about the</text>
  <text start="445.479" dur="6.591">underemployment in the States and if we</text>
  <text start="449.38" dur="6.18">look around here are the lowest</text>
  <text start="452.07" dur="5.56">underemployment in by state and again</text>
  <text start="455.56" dur="3.63">underemployment means that you know</text>
  <text start="457.63" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;ve take they went from a full-time</text>
  <text start="459.19" dur="4.32">job to some type of part-time job where</text>
  <text start="461.11" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re making a lot less money and if</text>
  <text start="463.51" dur="2.49">you&amp;#39;re making a lot less money you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="464.8" dur="2.31">not going to spend as much because</text>
  <text start="466" dur="5.13">you&amp;#39;re only going to spend your money on</text>
  <text start="467.11" dur="5.55">food clothing your rent or your mortgage</text>
  <text start="471.13" dur="3.78">and you&amp;#39;re not running out to buy a</text>
  <text start="472.66" dur="5.34">brand new car you&amp;#39;re not running out to</text>
  <text start="474.91" dur="5.34">buy the best newest HDTV you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="478" dur="5.49">trying to get by every single day so</text>
  <text start="480.25" dur="5.49">here we have it North Dakota has an</text>
  <text start="483.49" dur="5.88">under employment rate of ten percent</text>
  <text start="485.74" dur="6.17">Minnesota eleven percent Iowa twelve</text>
  <text start="489.37" dur="5.58">percent New Hampshire twelve percent</text>
  <text start="491.91" dur="6.09">Colorado fourteen percent now here are</text>
  <text start="494.95" dur="5.46">the highest under employment state</text>
  <text start="498" dur="4.65">California twenty-two percent of the</text>
  <text start="500.41" dur="5.939">population there are underemployed</text>

  <text start="511.599" dur="5.161">Florida nineteen percent North Carolina</text>
  <text start="514.45" dur="3.57">nineteen percent so you can see and</text>
  <text start="516.76" dur="2.94">there&amp;#39;s many of it there are a lot more</text>
  <text start="518.02" dur="3.329">states here i&amp;#39;m just reading a couple of</text>
  <text start="519.7" dur="5.04">them here there are a lot more states</text>
  <text start="521.349" dur="5.761">listed here and these are underemployed</text>
  <text start="524.74" dur="4.98">people where they once had a full-time</text>
  <text start="527.11" dur="5.099">job making a nice income and now they</text>
  <text start="529.72" dur="5.19">might have one or two part-time jobs but</text>
  <text start="532.209" dur="4.141">they are not making the income they used</text>
  <text start="534.91" dur="3.51">to make and since they&amp;#39;re not making</text>
  <text start="536.35" dur="3.52">that income and we combine this with the</text>
  <text start="538.42" dur="6.73">unemployment we</text>
  <text start="539.87" dur="7.65">have a disaster going on right now so</text>
  <text start="545.15" dur="4.92">let&amp;#39;s take this one step further here so</text>
  <text start="547.52" dur="6.6">what about all those college graduates</text>
  <text start="550.07" dur="6.69">that are out there and all the youth who</text>
  <text start="554.12" dur="5.46">are living with their parents from ages</text>
  <text start="556.76" dur="4.8">25 to 34 what is the percentage of those</text>
  <text start="559.58" dur="5.07">people actually living with their</text>
  <text start="561.56" dur="5.64">parents well that is around thirteen</text>
  <text start="564.65" dur="6.6">point six percent right now and that has</text>
  <text start="567.2" dur="5.79">increased since 2000 so back in two</text>
  <text start="571.25" dur="4.47">thousand it was about ten percent of</text>
  <text start="572.99" dur="4.26">youth between 25 and 30 for that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="575.72" dur="4.32">living with their parents it is now</text>
  <text start="577.25" dur="6.36">increased to thirteen point six percent</text>
  <text start="580.04" dur="5.7">and it&amp;#39;s continually rising and the main</text>
  <text start="583.61" dur="5.1">reason why these people are living with</text>
  <text start="585.74" dur="5.01">their parents is because when they come</text>
  <text start="588.71" dur="4.59">out of college they cannot find</text>
  <text start="590.75" dur="6.18">full-time work they can either they</text>
  <text start="593.3" dur="5.64">cannot find work in their field or they</text>

  <text start="598.94" dur="6.87">are just no jobs out there so they are</text>
  <text start="601.07" dur="7.019">staying home with their parents okay now</text>
  <text start="605.81" dur="5.81">if we look at the underemployment rate</text>
  <text start="608.089" dur="6.901">of these people who really want to work</text>
  <text start="611.62" dur="5.38">at a full-time job we are looking at a</text>
  <text start="614.99" dur="5.19">rate of about thirty two point eight</text>
  <text start="617" dur="6.99">percent who want to work full-time and</text>
  <text start="620.18" dur="6.09">but they just can&amp;#39;t at this time so in</text>
  <text start="623.99" dur="4.08">other words among young adults who live</text>
  <text start="626.27" dur="4.14">with their parents and are working or</text>
  <text start="628.07" dur="5.22">actively looking for work nearly one in</text>
  <text start="630.41" dur="5.97">three are in a substandard employment</text>
  <text start="633.29" dur="5.19">situation and again you have to remember</text>
  <text start="636.38" dur="4.62">that most of these students who went to</text>
  <text start="638.48" dur="5.07">school to college who came out with</text>
  <text start="641" dur="4.02">their degrees are in debt because of</text>
  <text start="643.55" dur="4.83">student loans and there&amp;#39;s approximately</text>
  <text start="645.02" dur="5.64">around over one trillion dollars of</text>
  <text start="648.38" dur="4.14">student loan debt out there and again we</text>
  <text start="650.66" dur="3.99">also have the credit card debt of these</text>
  <text start="652.52" dur="5.7">students because they run that up to pay</text>
  <text start="654.65" dur="6.48">for books and other things and just to</text>
  <text start="658.22" dur="4.559">get by and again in my couple of reports</text>
  <text start="661.13" dur="4.95">ago what has happened was the government</text>
  <text start="662.779" dur="5.131">came back and said holy crap we have all</text>
  <text start="666.08" dur="4.02">of these students who cannot make their</text>
  <text start="667.91" dur="5.38">payments we need to do something so they</text>
  <text start="670.1" dur="6.789">started they allowed the students to</text>
  <text start="673.29" dur="5.37">to redo their student loans so they can</text>
  <text start="676.889" dur="3.961">either have payments drawn out for a</text>
  <text start="678.66" dur="3.78">longer period of time or they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="680.85" dur="4.38">to make payments at this time because</text>
  <text start="682.44" dur="5.88">they realize that the use of America</text>
  <text start="685.23" dur="5.339">just don&amp;#39;t have work or the work they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="688.32" dur="6.269">working at they can&amp;#39;t make the payments</text>
  <text start="690.569" dur="5.281">on their student loans and again this is</text>
  <text start="694.589" dur="3.93">one of the worst things that can happen</text>
  <text start="695.85" dur="4.56">because when you default on your student</text>
  <text start="698.519" dur="4.141">loan it sticks with you it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="700.41" dur="5.07">disappear and it makes it very hard to</text>
  <text start="702.66" dur="4.14">get a car to get a house if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="705.48" dur="4.26">trying to get a mortgage or things like</text>
  <text start="706.8" dur="5.18">that so the use of America who we r</text>

  <text start="711.98" dur="4.33">falling apart right in front of our eyes</text>
  <text start="714.389" dur="3.93">and that&amp;#39;s what we are seeing at this</text>
  <text start="716.31" dur="5.19">time and this is why things are just</text>
  <text start="718.319" dur="5.07">getting worse not better now if we look</text>
  <text start="721.5" dur="3.99">at the housing market and they keep</text>
  <text start="723.389" dur="5.07">telling us how great the housing market</text>
  <text start="725.49" dur="6.36">is and how great things are prices are</text>
  <text start="728.459" dur="4.951">going up well guess what things are not</text>
  <text start="731.85" dur="2.94">going well we understand that the</text>
  <text start="733.41" dur="3.81">mortgage applications have been plugging</text>
  <text start="734.79" dur="4.289">around sixty six percent home prices are</text>
  <text start="737.22" dur="5.15">starting to come down and guess what</text>
  <text start="739.079" dur="8.341">they&amp;#39;re seeing right now they are seeing</text>
  <text start="742.37" dur="8.29">foreclosures start to spike up and they</text>
  <text start="747.42" dur="6.3">are seeing that across the country right</text>
  <text start="750.66" dur="7.47">now all of a sudden foreclosures jumped</text>
  <text start="753.72" dur="7.59">eight percent in January and in certain</text>
  <text start="758.13" dur="6.53">states they have jumped very high and we</text>
  <text start="761.31" dur="5.969">saw something like this prior to 2008</text>
  <text start="764.66" dur="5.38">when everything started fall apart we</text>
  <text start="767.279" dur="5.131">saw in california specifically just i</text>
  <text start="770.04" dur="4.83">remember seeing it on the news all these</text>
  <text start="772.41" dur="4.2">houses were vacant people just left they</text>
  <text start="774.87" dur="3">left their furniture their TV they just</text>

  <text start="777.87" dur="5.279">afford it well in california right now</text>
  <text start="780.54" dur="5.07">they had a fifty-seven percent jump in</text>
  <text start="783.149" dur="4.94">foreclosures in new jersey they have a</text>
  <text start="785.61" dur="4.95">seventy-nine percent increase in</text>

  <text start="799.22" dur="5.859">foreclosures so something is going on</text>
  <text start="802.41" dur="4.74">right now and we all know what it is we</text>
  <text start="805.079" dur="4.771">call it the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="807.15" dur="5.46">and things are not getting better I mean</text>
  <text start="809.85" dur="5.22">think about it they&amp;#39;ve from the previous</text>
  <text start="812.61" dur="5.19">reports that I&amp;#39;ve done we know that most</text>
  <text start="815.07" dur="5.19">of these homes across the country have</text>
  <text start="817.8" dur="4.95">been purchased with cash cash sixty</text>
  <text start="820.26" dur="5.07">percent or so and mortgage applications</text>
  <text start="822.75" dur="5.49">have been declining we also understand</text>
  <text start="825.33" dur="5.19">that mortgage departments in well-known</text>
  <text start="828.24" dur="4.41">banks like Wells Fargo Citibank Bank of</text>
  <text start="830.52" dur="4.02">America have laid off thousands upon</text>
  <text start="832.65" dur="4.47">thousands of people because they</text>
  <text start="834.54" dur="3.81">understood this was not going to get</text>
  <text start="837.12" dur="3.21">better and they understood that this was</text>
  <text start="838.35" dur="3.54">in a bubble and they wanted to trim down</text>
  <text start="840.33" dur="3.6">the department&amp;#39;s because they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="841.89" dur="4.2">need them because they understood that</text>
  <text start="843.93" dur="4.2">no one was coming to get a mortgage and</text>
  <text start="846.09" dur="4.86">this is what&amp;#39;s happening right now and</text>
  <text start="848.13" dur="4.98">now we see people and these homes that</text>
  <text start="850.95" dur="4.47">are out there they can&amp;#39;t afford them</text>
  <text start="853.11" dur="4.44">they don&amp;#39;t have work unemployment is</text>
  <text start="855.42" dur="4.2">getting worse underemployment is getting</text>
  <text start="857.55" dur="5.82">worse and we&amp;#39;re seeing foreclosures</text>
  <text start="859.62" dur="6.75">start to spike up again now we</text>
  <text start="863.37" dur="5.88">understand that these mortgage companies</text>
  <text start="866.37" dur="6.3">and the Fed the government have been</text>
  <text start="869.25" dur="5.61">trying to boost real estate the real</text>
  <text start="872.67" dur="3.3">estate market and what they&amp;#39;ve done is</text>
  <text start="874.86" dur="2.97">they created you know one hundred</text>
  <text start="875.97" dur="4.62">percent financing and I&amp;#39;ve saw it when I</text>
  <text start="877.83" dur="4.26">was up in North Carolina I saw a lot of</text>
  <text start="880.59" dur="4.26">signs saying a hundred percent financing</text>
  <text start="882.09" dur="5.01">just coming in come on in no down</text>
  <text start="884.85" dur="4.65">payment or anything like that then they</text>
  <text start="887.1" dur="4.62">decided let&amp;#39;s go back to the arms which</text>
  <text start="889.5" dur="4.11">is the adjustable rate mortgage this</text>
  <text start="891.72" dur="3.21">will help people because mortgage rates</text>
  <text start="893.61" dur="3.21">have been rising so this will help</text>
  <text start="894.93" dur="6.66">people get into the real estate market</text>
  <text start="896.82" dur="8.91">well Wells Fargo is now returning to the</text>
  <text start="901.59" dur="6.63">subprime market and again the circle is</text>
  <text start="905.73" dur="6.09">complete we are back to two thousand</text>
  <text start="908.22" dur="4.77">eight here we are and things are not</text>
  <text start="911.82" dur="3.84">getting better because they wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="912.99" dur="5.67">have to resort to going back to arms a</text>
  <text start="915.66" dur="5.13">hundred percent financing and moving</text>
  <text start="918.66" dur="6.15">into the subprime market if things were</text>
  <text start="920.79" dur="6.84">going well this is a perfect indicator</text>
  <text start="924.81" dur="5.79">that the real estate market is starting</text>
  <text start="927.63" dur="4.89">to collapse and again Wells Fargo is</text>
  <text start="930.6" dur="4.44">looking at loans to borrowers with we</text>
  <text start="932.52" dur="5.64">credit we believe the wall has begun to</text>
  <text start="935.04" dur="5.36">come down wrote Paul Miller a bank</text>
  <text start="938.16" dur="5.21">analyst at fBR Capital mark</text>
  <text start="940.4" dur="5.67">and I completely agree this is another</text>
  <text start="943.37" dur="4.59">sign another indicator that things are</text>
  <text start="946.07" dur="4.71">completely falling apart because when</text>
  <text start="947.96" dur="6.3">things in the economy are doing well</text>
  <text start="950.78" dur="5.43">they expand mortgage departments hire</text>
  <text start="954.26" dur="4.89">more people because they understand that</text>
  <text start="956.21" dur="4.86">more people are buying homes you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="959.15" dur="4.17">have to offer arms you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>

  <text start="963.32" dur="4.56">have to give a hundred percent financing</text>
  <text start="964.94" dur="5.01">why because people are making a good</text>
  <text start="967.88" dur="3.63">living people who are making a good</text>
  <text start="969.95" dur="3.66">living can save money people who can</text>
  <text start="971.51" dur="4.32">save money can put a down payment on a</text>
  <text start="973.61" dur="4.77">home but what we&amp;#39;re seeing is the</text>
  <text start="975.83" dur="5.37">opposite we also see this in the</text>
  <text start="978.38" dur="5.66">automobile industry where of course I</text>
  <text start="981.2" dur="4.86">reported on that the American</text>

  <text start="992.66" dur="5.01">again they have also implemented the</text>

  <text start="997.67" dur="5.07">to people that have absolutely bad</text>
  <text start="999.65" dur="5.13">credit no credit and again they have to</text>
  <text start="1002.74" dur="4.44">open this up because most of the country</text>
  <text start="1004.78" dur="3.99">at this time they do not have good</text>
  <text start="1007.18" dur="4.14">credit because think about it the</text>
  <text start="1008.77" dur="5.28">millions upon millions of properties</text>
  <text start="1011.32" dur="5.64">that were foreclosed on from 2008 to now</text>
  <text start="1014.05" dur="4.95">the amount of short sales these people</text>

  <text start="1029.74" dur="5.34">credit and it&amp;#39;s starting to seep into</text>
  <text start="1032.11" dur="4.53">many more people as time goes on because</text>
  <text start="1035.08" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re starting to lose their work and</text>
  <text start="1036.64" dur="5.1">again the start of this year around</text>
  <text start="1039.55" dur="5.49">sixty one thousand or so people have</text>
  <text start="1041.74" dur="5.46">lost work again they&amp;#39;re starting now</text>
  <text start="1045.04" dur="3.96">they won&amp;#39;t be able to find work maybe</text>
  <text start="1047.2" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;ll find some part-time jobs but</text>
  <text start="1049" dur="3.36">guess what&amp;#39;s going to happen they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1050.59" dur="4.38">going to start struggling they&amp;#39;ll start</text>
  <text start="1052.36" dur="4.47">diving into the savings once the saving</text>
  <text start="1054.97" dur="3.3">is depleted they won&amp;#39;t be able to pay</text>
  <text start="1056.83" dur="3.18">for their homes those homes will be</text>
  <text start="1058.27" dur="3.45">foreclosed on they will not be able to</text>
  <text start="1060.01" dur="3.63">pay for their credit cards because most</text>
  <text start="1061.72" dur="5.1">of the people today live paycheck to</text>
  <text start="1063.64" dur="5.52">paycheck and that has been proven and a</text>
  <text start="1066.82" dur="5.76">lot of statistics have been out on that</text>
  <text start="1069.16" dur="4.56">now there was a poll taken and the poll</text>
  <text start="1072.58" dur="3.54">says that</text>
  <text start="1073.72" dur="4.589">Americans have lost hope in the American</text>
  <text start="1076.12" dur="5.939">dream and I can&amp;#39;t imagine why they feel</text>
  <text start="1078.309" dur="6">this way well I guess I can Americans</text>
  <text start="1082.059" dur="4.561">are pessimistic about their chances of</text>
  <text start="1084.309" dur="5.521">achieving and sustaining the American</text>
  <text start="1086.62" dur="5.46">dream a poll conducted februari 4th to</text>
  <text start="1089.83" dur="4.349">9th says that eighty percent of</text>

  <text start="1094.179" dur="4.351">previous generations to get ahead they</text>
  <text start="1096.34" dur="4.199">see an economic system in which they</text>
  <text start="1098.53" dur="3.66">have to work harder than ever to get</text>

  <text start="1106.539" dur="5.64">set of rules from everyone else and</text>
  <text start="1108.909" dur="5.461">again if you really look I agree</text>
  <text start="1112.179" dur="5.401">completely with this poll because that</text>
  <text start="1114.37" dur="5.58">is what I am seeing people just feel</text>
  <text start="1117.58" dur="5.13">that those in Washington are not looking</text>
  <text start="1119.95" dur="5.729">out for them they really feel a</text>
  <text start="1122.71" dur="4.92">disconnect and I completely agree the</text>
  <text start="1125.679" dur="3.601">people in Washington are not looking out</text>
  <text start="1127.63" dur="3.799">for the people because if they were they</text>
  <text start="1129.28" dur="4.56">would have never implement Obamacare</text>
  <text start="1131.429" dur="5.261">actually every single government</text>
  <text start="1133.84" dur="4.62">official would have read all of these</text>

  <text start="1148.5" dur="5.86">programs are going to go skyrocketing</text>
  <text start="1151.44" dur="6.04">employers are going to lay off people so</text>

  <text start="1159.94" dur="4.08">going to keep their numbers of employees</text>
  <text start="1161.409" dur="6.181">down and this is why Obamacare how to</text>
  <text start="1164.02" dur="5.76">rewrite the health insurance law to make</text>
  <text start="1167.59" dur="3.839">it so these companies do not lay off</text>
  <text start="1169.78" dur="4.41">more people because they really</text>

  <text start="1181.96" dur="3.87">realized that they needed to stop this</text>
  <text start="1184.12" dur="4.59">right now so that&amp;#39;s why he went in and</text>

  <text start="1460.78" dur="3.029">what the government is telling us</text>
  <text start="1462.25" dur="3.03">actually most of the time it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1463.809" dur="3.811">opposite of what the government is</text>
  <text start="1465.28" dur="4.77">telling us because we look through the</text>
  <text start="1467.62" dur="6.68">crap they get to the truth of what is</text>
  <text start="1470.05" dur="6.27">really going on for instance on the new</text>
  <text start="1474.3" dur="4.39">the Department of Health and Human</text>
  <text start="1476.32" dur="4.41">Services reported that the number of</text>
  <text start="1478.69" dur="4.98">Americans who have selected the Obama</text>
  <text start="1480.73" dur="5.37">care plan has reached 3.3 million now of</text>
  <text start="1483.67" dur="4.98">course when you hear that you say oh my</text>
  <text start="1486.1" dur="5.19">god people are joining up to Obamacare</text>
  <text start="1488.65" dur="5.13">over 3.3 million but you have to look at</text>
  <text start="1491.29" dur="6.51">the words that they use they use the</text>
  <text start="1493.78" dur="7.02">word selected okay and it does not mean</text>
  <text start="1497.8" dur="5.91">enrolled that means they selected a plan</text>
  <text start="1500.8" dur="5.85">in insurance when you enroll you</text>
  <text start="1503.71" dur="4.95">actually pay when you select you just</text>
  <text start="1506.65" dur="5.04">chose that plan but you haven&amp;#39;t paid for</text>
  <text start="1508.66" dur="8.52">yet so 3.3 million people have selected</text>
  <text start="1511.69" dur="9.9">it but guess what only 660,000 actually</text>
  <text start="1517.18" dur="6.84">are paid in the system so this number of</text>
  <text start="1521.59" dur="4.83">3.3 million is very misleading because</text>
  <text start="1524.02" dur="4.83">you could have gone on to Obamacare or</text>
  <text start="1526.42" dur="5.79">one of the and say yes I like this plan</text>
  <text start="1528.85" dur="7.11">I select it but never give the money for</text>
  <text start="1532.21" dur="5.79">the plan it&amp;#39;s meaningless it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="1535.96" dur="5.22">like going to let&amp;#39;s say Amazon and</text>
  <text start="1538" dur="6">putting you know 10 different items in</text>
  <text start="1541.18" dur="5.19">your cart but never paying for it so</text>
  <text start="1544" dur="5.34">they added their stuff to their cart but</text>
  <text start="1546.37" dur="4.98">they haven&amp;#39;t paid only 660,000 of paid</text>
  <text start="1549.34" dur="3.63">but when you look at the news in the</text>
  <text start="1551.35" dur="3.66">corporate media and of course the</text>
  <text start="1552.97" dur="5.69">federal government when they tell you</text>
  <text start="1555.01" dur="6.27">3.3 million have selected obamacare and</text>
  <text start="1558.66" dur="6.13">received it you know have selected and</text>
  <text start="1561.28" dur="6.21">and chose their insurance package they</text>
  <text start="1564.79" dur="7.35">actually didn&amp;#39;t pay and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1567.49" dur="9.75">enrolled only 660,000 are enrollees and</text>
  <text start="1572.14" dur="7.44">have actually paid for Obamacare okay</text>
  <text start="1577.24" dur="8.31">now Russia has completely come out now</text>
  <text start="1579.58" dur="8.91">and said that the United States is trot</text>
  <text start="1585.55" dur="6.03">using the peace talks with Syria the</text>
  <text start="1588.49" dur="5.07">Geneva 2 for regime change in syria they</text>
  <text start="1591.58" dur="3.06">just came out and said it and they</text>
  <text start="1593.56" dur="3.33">didn&amp;#39;t beat around the bush they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1594.64" dur="4.68">saying this is all they want and this is</text>
  <text start="1596.89" dur="4.86">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do and this goes</text>
  <text start="1599.32" dur="4.23">on to say that we have an impression</text>
  <text start="1601.75" dur="4.53">that those backing the opposition in</text>
  <text start="1603.55" dur="3.87">this process had in mind only one thing</text>
  <text start="1606.28" dur="3.87">regime</text>
  <text start="1607.42" dur="5.01">change Lavrov said noting the talks were</text>
  <text start="1610.15" dur="4.35">going in circles well of course they</text>
  <text start="1612.43" dur="4.86">were because this was their whole agenda</text>
  <text start="1614.5" dur="5.25">their agenda was to remove Assad</text>
  <text start="1617.29" dur="7.26">actually this was their agenda all along</text>
  <text start="1619.75" dur="7.08">going back to 2011 when the the war</text>
  <text start="1624.55" dur="4.74">broke out and the United States and</text>
  <text start="1626.83" dur="6.3">Israel and Saudi Arabia and other states</text>
  <text start="1629.29" dur="6.36">decided to pay for paid mercenaries to</text>
  <text start="1633.13" dur="4.32">go into Syria to try to remove Assad and</text>
  <text start="1635.65" dur="3.72">when that wasn&amp;#39;t going well what they</text>
  <text start="1637.45" dur="4.08">did was they try to use false flag</text>
  <text start="1639.37" dur="4.23">events like the chemical attack and</text>
  <text start="1641.53" dur="4.08">since that was a completely sidetracked</text>
  <text start="1643.6" dur="4.53">by Russia and that they couldn&amp;#39;t push</text>
  <text start="1645.61" dur="4.35">that any further they had a regroup now</text>
  <text start="1648.13" dur="5.58">they have regrouped so they decided</text>
  <text start="1649.96" dur="6.48">let&amp;#39;s try a Geneva tube peace talk and</text>
  <text start="1653.71" dur="5.34">let&amp;#39;s see if they&amp;#39;ll agree upon removing</text>
  <text start="1656.44" dur="5.07">Assad from government and guess what</text>
  <text start="1659.05" dur="4.32">that&amp;#39;s not going to happen so now</text>
  <text start="1661.51" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re trying the next thing well we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1663.37" dur="6.39">go into the UN and say people are dying</text>
  <text start="1666.88" dur="4.8">out there they need humanitarian aid and</text>
  <text start="1669.76" dur="3.66">we really need to get in there so we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1671.68" dur="4.8">create this document and we&amp;#39;ll have them</text>
  <text start="1673.42" dur="5.82">the UN sign off on it and we&amp;#39;ll go in</text>
  <text start="1676.48" dur="4.56">for humanitarian aid and of course they</text>
  <text start="1679.24" dur="3.6">created this UN document and of course</text>
  <text start="1681.04" dur="4.05">it said that Assad committed war crimes</text>
  <text start="1682.84" dur="4.89">that&amp;#39;s why all these people are dying</text>
  <text start="1685.09" dur="4.41">and we have to go in for humanitarian</text>
  <text start="1687.73" dur="3.72">aid and of course Russia call them on</text>
  <text start="1689.5" dur="3.57">this and so we will veto this because</text>
  <text start="1691.45" dur="4.5">that&amp;#39;s not right now you&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="1693.07" dur="5.52">he committed war crimes and if we all</text>
  <text start="1695.95" dur="4.5">sign off on this it&amp;#39;s showing that he</text>
  <text start="1698.59" dur="3.36">needs to be removed and we are not doing</text>
  <text start="1700.45" dur="3.57">this because there&amp;#39;s absolutely no proof</text>
  <text start="1701.95" dur="4.98">at this time and you really have to step</text>
  <text start="1704.02" dur="6.24">back and take a look united states</text>
  <text start="1706.93" dur="6.36">central bankers Israel Saudi Arabia and</text>
  <text start="1710.26" dur="5.52">other states paid rebels to go into</text>
  <text start="1713.29" dur="4.14">Syria and start fighting now most of</text>
  <text start="1715.78" dur="3.6">these people aren&amp;#39;t Syrian so they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="1717.43" dur="4.53">the country and they&amp;#39;re killing people</text>
  <text start="1719.38" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re bombing towns they&amp;#39;re bombing</text>
  <text start="1721.96" dur="4.14">villages they&amp;#39;re using false flag</text>
  <text start="1724.42" dur="4.65">chemical attacks on the Syrian people</text>
  <text start="1726.1" dur="6.36">and they&amp;#39;re trying to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="1729.07" dur="5.34">that Assad is the person who&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1732.46" dur="5.85">doing all this but it has been proven</text>
  <text start="1734.41" dur="6.69">that the Syrian rebels have created and</text>
  <text start="1738.31" dur="6.869">implemented these chemical attacks</text>
  <text start="1741.1" dur="5.76">on the Syrian people and MIT shown that</text>
  <text start="1745.179" dur="4.561">it was impossible for the government to</text>
  <text start="1746.86" dur="4.62">do this with the crude missile that they</text>
  <text start="1749.74" dur="3.569">used and actually from where the</text>
  <text start="1751.48" dur="3.63">government was positioned it would be</text>
  <text start="1753.309" dur="4.711">impossible for this missile to reach the</text>
  <text start="1755.11" dur="5.64">location and it showed that the rebel</text>
  <text start="1758.02" dur="4.71">forces did have sarin gas in their</text>
  <text start="1760.75" dur="3.78">possession and that whole thing</text>
  <text start="1762.73" dur="3.3">completely fell apart and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1764.53" dur="3.84">trying other tactics and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1766.03" dur="3.899">to try more of these two before they use</text>
  <text start="1768.37" dur="3.9">the false flag event and we can see it</text>
  <text start="1769.929" dur="4.62">building up it is completely building up</text>
  <text start="1772.27" dur="3.84">and they are definitely going to use</text>
  <text start="1774.549" dur="3.901">some type of false flag event because</text>
  <text start="1776.11" dur="6.84">they understand they need to get into</text>
  <text start="1778.45" dur="6.479">iran and syria to prop up the US dollar</text>
  <text start="1782.95" dur="6.57">and this is the only way they know how</text>
  <text start="1784.929" dur="7.261">to do this now I talk a lot about the</text>
  <text start="1789.52" dur="5.22">United States central bankers there in</text>
  <text start="1792.19" dur="4.41">Africa there in the Middle East and the</text>
  <text start="1794.74" dur="4.65">reason for this is because China is</text>
  <text start="1796.6" dur="5.37">there and you know they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1799.39" dur="4.56">keep drawing at bay because China is</text>
  <text start="1801.97" dur="3.839">pumping in billions of dollars into the</text>

  <text start="1812.98" dur="3.63">using US dollars to do this because</text>
  <text start="1814.48" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re unloading their US dollars but</text>
  <text start="1816.61" dur="4.71">there is actually another reason why the</text>

  <text start="1821.32" dur="5.76">reason but we have to remember that they</text>
  <text start="1824.53" dur="5.58">are positioning themselves for World War</text>
  <text start="1827.08" dur="4.62">three and they understand this most of</text>
  <text start="1830.11" dur="5.36">the natural resources that they that</text>
  <text start="1831.7" dur="7.589">they need and key strategic materials</text>
  <text start="1835.47" dur="6.699">for manufacturing sophisticated military</text>
  <text start="1839.289" dur="4.981">hardware or components such as airframes</text>
  <text start="1842.169" dur="4.921">gas turbines rocket motors munitions</text>
  <text start="1844.27" dur="5.94">armor and electronics they usually get</text>
  <text start="1847.09" dur="6.39">from china and russia they&amp;#39;d understand</text>
  <text start="1850.21" dur="4.98">when World War three starts they will</text>
  <text start="1853.48" dur="3.96">not be able to do this so they need to</text>
  <text start="1855.19" dur="4.95">look for areas where they can get their</text>
  <text start="1857.44" dur="5.489">hands on these natural materials and</text>
  <text start="1860.14" dur="5.039">guess where all these natural materials</text>
  <text start="1862.929" dur="6.271">are that they need they&amp;#39;re actually in</text>
  <text start="1865.179" dur="5.761">Africa and here are some of the</text>
  <text start="1869.2" dur="4.62">materials that they need to build some</text>
  <text start="1870.94" dur="4.19">of this stuff cobalt this is primarily</text>
  <text start="1873.82" dur="4.31">mine in the demand</text>
  <text start="1875.13" dur="5.88">Democratic Republic of Congo cobalt is</text>
  <text start="1878.13" dur="7.98">used in alloys with other metals to make</text>
  <text start="1881.01" dur="7.83">gas turbines and jet engines tantalum is</text>
  <text start="1886.11" dur="5.22">a rare hard blue gray metal that is used</text>
  <text start="1888.84" dur="4.95">in jet engines nuclear weapons and</text>
  <text start="1891.33" dur="4.05">missile parts it&amp;#39;s a non-military uses</text>
  <text start="1893.79" dur="4.05">include och Tronics as well as medical</text>
  <text start="1895.38" dur="4.2">equipment and implants the Democratic</text>
  <text start="1897.84" dur="4.68">Republic of Congo is one of the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1899.58" dur="5.46">largest sources of this metal tungsten</text>
  <text start="1902.52" dur="4.92">the hard metal is often used in missiles</text>
  <text start="1905.04" dur="5.94">and ammunition and a guess again it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1907.44" dur="6.87">located in Africa so this is another</text>
  <text start="1910.98" dur="6.42">reason why the United States is in this</text>
  <text start="1914.31" dur="5.13">area so we can see what is happening</text>
  <text start="1917.4" dur="5.31">here they are building up for World War</text>
  <text start="1919.44" dur="5.31">3 there in Africa because they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1922.71" dur="3.95">to push China back we understand the</text>
  <text start="1924.75" dur="3.99">kenya clearinghouse for the yuan</text>
  <text start="1926.66" dur="5.29">countries are starting to switch the</text>
  <text start="1928.74" dur="6.6">reserves from the US dollar into the u1</text>
  <text start="1931.95" dur="5.13">and China is pumping in billions and</text>
  <text start="1935.34" dur="3.96">billions into their infrastructure they</text>
  <text start="1937.08" dur="3.72">understand when the war breaks out they</text>
  <text start="1939.3" dur="3.27">will not be able to get these critical</text>
  <text start="1940.8" dur="3.42">materials that they need so they need to</text>
  <text start="1942.57" dur="4.74">find them in different places and they</text>
  <text start="1944.22" dur="5.07">need to secure these locations so when</text>
  <text start="1947.31" dur="5.58">the war breaks out they can mine and</text>
  <text start="1949.29" dur="5.49">extract the material they need for the</text>
  <text start="1952.89" dur="4.05">jet engines the electronics the bombs</text>
  <text start="1954.78" dur="4.59">the missiles and all these things so we</text>
  <text start="1956.94" dur="5.34">can see exactly what is happening and</text>
  <text start="1959.37" dur="4.5">again if we look further out we see you</text>
  <text start="1962.28" dur="3.96">know the pivot to Asia the missile</text>
  <text start="1963.87" dur="4.77">shield all military assets being</text>
  <text start="1966.24" dur="5.52">pre-positioned for world war three and</text>
  <text start="1968.64" dur="5.03">we can tell you right now we will end up</text>
  <text start="1971.76" dur="4.59">in world war three because as the dollar</text>
  <text start="1973.67" dur="5.17">collapses the economy collapses they</text>
  <text start="1976.35" dur="6.6">will use the false flag event to move</text>
  <text start="1978.84" dur="6.96">this whole war agenda Ford by going into</text>
  <text start="1982.95" dur="4.65">Syria or Iran or whatever country I</text>
  <text start="1985.8" dur="3.69">think it looks like really Syria Iran at</text>
  <text start="1987.6" dur="4.95">this point and again we have to remember</text>
  <text start="1989.49" dur="5.85">Russia and China back Syria back Iran</text>
  <text start="1992.55" dur="4.89">Iran and Syria has a pact with each</text>
  <text start="1995.34" dur="4.2">other and we can see you know that</text>
  <text start="1997.44" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;ll come to their aid if war breaks</text>
  <text start="1999.54" dur="6.12">out so we can see what what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="2001.4" dur="7.53">here and we are seeing a lot of cyber</text>
  <text start="2005.66" dur="5.55">attacks mum being done across</text>

  <text start="2060.26" dur="6.96">and we can see this is all propaganda to</text>
  <text start="2063.02" dur="7.2">build up the case that Syria will be the</text>
  <text start="2067.22" dur="8.28">cyber attacking force that will give us</text>
  <text start="2070.22" dur="7.02">the virtual 911 reference to banks the</text>
  <text start="2075.5" dur="4.74">financial institutions and most likely</text>

  <text start="2115.37" dur="5.91">damaging the economy of America and that</text>
  <text start="2119.03" dur="4.05">just leads me to believe right now that</text>
  <text start="2121.28" dur="4.92">they are building this up in our minds</text>
  <text start="2123.08" dur="5.61">that cyber attacks will in fact destroy</text>
