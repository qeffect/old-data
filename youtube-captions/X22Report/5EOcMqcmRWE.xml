  <text start="116.41" dur="4.23">can manipulate yes they can do whatever</text>
  <text start="118.54" dur="6.24">they have to do but when we look at this</text>
  <text start="120.64" dur="6.75">we see that Europe the eurozone it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="124.78" dur="5.399">starting to slide actually it has been</text>
  <text start="127.39" dur="4.59">sliding they pumped it up with zero</text>

  <text start="131.98" dur="4.91">rates creation of free money and right</text>
  <text start="135.22" dur="6.12">now we&amp;#39;re seeing eurozone manufacturing</text>
  <text start="136.89" dur="5.89">their growth has slowed market has come</text>
  <text start="141.34" dur="5.78">out with the Purchasing Managers Index</text>
  <text start="142.78" dur="6.209">for January and he came in around 52.3</text>
  <text start="147.12" dur="7.949">they thought it was going to be around</text>
  <text start="148.989" dur="8.371">53.2 so it missed its estimates and</text>
  <text start="155.069" dur="5.681">market is out there saying that</text>
  <text start="157.36" dur="6.78">expansion in output new orders new</text>
  <text start="160.75" dur="5.28">export business all eased</text>
  <text start="164.14" dur="6.81">during the month which means it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="166.03" dur="8.16">starting to slow and we can see that in</text>
  <text start="170.95" dur="5.85">the United States manufacturing is</text>
  <text start="174.19" dur="6.54">continually declining and not doing well</text>
  <text start="176.8" dur="7.37">and even every even the people who are</text>
  <text start="180.73" dur="7.71">losing their jobs who can&amp;#39;t find work</text>
  <text start="184.17" dur="6.01">because of these mass layoffs and there</text>
  <text start="188.44" dur="3.84">are thousands upon thousands of people</text>
  <text start="190.18" dur="6.05">being laid off retail stores are closing</text>
  <text start="192.28" dur="7.22">and we are starting to see that people</text>
  <text start="196.23" dur="5.56">they&amp;#39;re just not spending their funds</text>
  <text start="199.5" dur="5.62">why because they&amp;#39;re nervous they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="201.79" dur="5.16">afraid they&amp;#39;re scared and normally what</text>
  <text start="205.12" dur="3.69">people do is they try to sock away as</text>
  <text start="206.95" dur="3.99">much as they possibly can now a lot of</text>
  <text start="208.81" dur="5.94">these people are working one two three</text>
  <text start="210.94" dur="6.6">four part-time jobs and we see in</text>
  <text start="214.75" dur="8.04">December spending was a complete</text>
  <text start="217.54" dur="8.52">disaster it didn&amp;#39;t go anywhere people</text>
  <text start="222.79" dur="7.68">who are continually keeping funds in the</text>
  <text start="226.06" dur="6.39">bank has gone up and we can see this is</text>
  <text start="230.47" dur="3.54">why the holiday season was a complete</text>
  <text start="232.45" dur="3.03">disaster because people are very nervous</text>
  <text start="234.01" dur="8.25">about what the economy is really doing</text>
  <text start="235.48" dur="10.46">and we have to realize where are all</text>
  <text start="242.26" dur="7.59">these personal income gains coming from</text>
  <text start="245.94" dur="6.28">well forty-two percent of december&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="249.85" dur="5.13">personal income gains came from</text>
  <text start="252.22" dur="6.66">government social benefits Social</text>
  <text start="254.98" dur="8.7">Security which includes Medicare that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="258.88" dur="8.84">where all this came from but we can see</text>
  <text start="263.68" dur="6.35">that this cannot keep the economy alive</text>
  <text start="267.72" dur="7.81">because right now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="270.03" dur="9.52">that hundreds of stores are closing down</text>
  <text start="275.53" dur="8.1">in the United States shoppers are also</text>
  <text start="279.55" dur="9.03">reporting that shelves in many retail</text>
  <text start="283.63" dur="7.56">locations are kind of empty that they</text>
  <text start="288.58" dur="5.94">don&amp;#39;t have the same stock on the shelves</text>
  <text start="291.19" dur="5.52">that they used to have and we can see</text>
  <text start="294.52" dur="3.119">that from what&amp;#39;s going on here is that</text>
  <text start="296.71" dur="3.269">things</text>
  <text start="297.639" dur="4.74">are starting to fall apart I mean</text>
  <text start="299.979" dur="5.581">Walmart they&amp;#39;re closing 269 stores</text>
  <text start="302.379" dur="6.481">including 150 150 for in the United</text>
  <text start="305.56" dur="8.28">States Kmart is closing down two dozen</text>
  <text start="308.86" dur="8.669">stores JC Penney 47 more stores because</text>
  <text start="313.84" dur="5.729">they already closed 40 and 2015 Macy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="317.529" dur="5.151">we know is closing their stores laying</text>
  <text start="319.569" dur="7.5">off about 2500 people the gap is closing</text>
  <text start="322.68" dur="9.239">175 stores our past l84 stores finish</text>
  <text start="327.069" dur="13.551">line 150 stores Sears about 600 stores</text>
  <text start="331.919" dur="13.331">and this entire retail scenario tells us</text>
  <text start="340.62" dur="7.09">that people do not have the jobs they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="345.25" dur="4.979">not secure in whatever job they have or</text>
  <text start="347.71" dur="6.179">if they don&amp;#39;t have a job they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="350.229" dur="5.701">okay guess what spending is off we are</text>
  <text start="353.889" dur="7.43">not going out there and this is why we</text>
  <text start="355.93" dur="8.25">see the demand for products is</text>
  <text start="361.319" dur="5.051">continually declining and if no one is</text>
  <text start="364.18" dur="4.139">demanding these products are known going</text>
  <text start="366.37" dur="5.69">out and purchasing them guess what</text>
  <text start="368.319" dur="5.97">manufacturers they don&amp;#39;t have to produce</text>
  <text start="372.06" dur="4.96">they don&amp;#39;t have to produce they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="374.289" dur="6.421">need the raw material it all feeds into</text>
  <text start="377.02" dur="7.25">each other I mean we&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="380.71" dur="6.12">revenue and earnings of corporations</text>
  <text start="384.27" dur="5.829">forty percent of the companies in the</text>
  <text start="386.83" dur="4.94">S&amp;amp;P 500 index they&amp;#39;ve reported their</text>
  <text start="390.099" dur="4.521">earnings for the fourth quarter</text>
  <text start="391.77" dur="6.25">including eight of the top ten by weight</text>
  <text start="394.62" dur="4.539">the S&amp;amp;P 500 companies they account for</text>
  <text start="398.02" dur="4.109">about eighty percent of the market</text>
  <text start="399.159" dur="6.24">capitalization and it gives us a good</text>
  <text start="402.129" dur="7.25">example of how corporate America is</text>
  <text start="405.399" dur="10.32">doing and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="409.379" dur="9.13">that it&amp;#39;s not doing too well and we say</text>
  <text start="415.719" dur="6.57">we&amp;#39;re getting a blended type of report</text>
  <text start="418.509" dur="6.991">here because some companies reported in</text>
  <text start="422.289" dur="5.1">some some didn&amp;#39;t and they blend the</text>
  <text start="425.5" dur="4.74">information together and this is coming</text>
  <text start="427.389" dur="4.5">from factset and we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="430.24" dur="5.429">revenue declines</text>
  <text start="431.889" dur="7.53">are stretching across four quarters in a</text>
  <text start="435.669" dur="6.571">row when was the last time we saw this</text>
  <text start="439.419" dur="6.9">huh this was back in two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="442.24" dur="9.179">and two thousand nine four of the ten</text>
  <text start="446.319" dur="8.87">sectors are in red energy material</text>
  <text start="451.419" dur="3.77">sector they got hit the hardest</text>
  <text start="455.249" dur="9.13">industrials they&amp;#39;re also weak technology</text>
  <text start="459.189" dur="7.741">also week we&amp;#39;re seeing things completely</text>
  <text start="464.379" dur="4.22">fall apart Microsoft and IBM their</text>
  <text start="466.93" dur="5.97">revenues dropped by ten percent and</text>
  <text start="468.599" dur="5.53">eight-point-five percent so basically we</text>
  <text start="472.9" dur="3.269">are starting to see things fall apart</text>
  <text start="474.129" dur="5.611">energy is down by negative thirty five</text>

  <text start="495.36" dur="5.35">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="497.86" dur="4.26">starting to spread and what accompanies</text>
  <text start="500.71" dur="3.319">do while they have to cut costs of</text>
  <text start="502.12" dur="4.169">course and what does that really mean</text>
  <text start="504.029" dur="5.29">that means they&amp;#39;re going to lay off more</text>
  <text start="506.289" dur="6.271">people and if the tech industry is not</text>
  <text start="509.319" dur="5.931">doing well guess what happens they lay</text>
  <text start="512.56" dur="6.469">off people remember a lot of the</text>
  <text start="515.25" dur="8.349">companies that have their tech employees</text>
  <text start="519.029" dur="8.321">this is an expense and those people</text>
  <text start="523.599" dur="5.521">normally go first and we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="527.35" dur="4.44">this because we&amp;#39;re starting to see that</text>
  <text start="529.12" dur="3.899">a lot of corporations are saying okay</text>
  <text start="531.79" dur="3.39">we&amp;#39;re not bringing in revenue we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="533.019" dur="5.19">bringing in the earnings let&amp;#39;s cut the</text>

  <text start="538.209" dur="3.171">to keep everything looking good and</text>
  <text start="539.649" dur="4.321">things are really starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="541.38" dur="5.53">manufacturing here in the country guess</text>
  <text start="543.97" dur="6.72">what it disappointed again they are</text>
  <text start="546.91" dur="7.26">expecting a 52.6 it came in at 52.4 this</text>
  <text start="550.69" dur="6.6">is the fifth month in a row that the ISF</text>
  <text start="554.17" dur="6">manufacturing is completely falling</text>
  <text start="557.29" dur="5.729">apart and we&amp;#39;re looking at manufacturing</text>
  <text start="560.17" dur="5.63">right now and we see new export orders</text>
  <text start="563.019" dur="2.781">crashed</text>
  <text start="565.889" dur="8.051">everything is declining right now I mean</text>
  <text start="570.819" dur="5.46">these are hard facts this is not pie in</text>
  <text start="573.94" dur="4.139">the sky this is not like oh the</text>
  <text start="576.279" dur="4.711">economy&amp;#39;s just going to spring back out</text>
  <text start="578.079" dur="5.601">of nowhere the Baltic Dry Index right</text>
  <text start="580.99" dur="6.959">now it dropped another three points</text>
  <text start="583.68" dur="7.06">we&amp;#39;re down to 314 so we see that the</text>
  <text start="587.949" dur="5.521">Atlanta Fed is out there looking at the</text>
  <text start="590.74" dur="6.209">whole entire situation and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="593.47" dur="7.02">saying okay the fourth quarter was a</text>
  <text start="596.949" dur="8.37">complete disaster it we brought in about</text>
  <text start="600.49" dur="6.93">point seven percent of GDP and they</text>
  <text start="605.319" dur="6.45">might even have to redo that reduce this</text>
  <text start="607.42" dur="7.169">number because today we had a very big</text>
  <text start="611.769" dur="4.44">construction spending miss so we might</text>
  <text start="614.589" dur="4.68">see the point seven percent go down to</text>
  <text start="616.209" dur="4.32">maybe point three percent the Atlanta</text>
  <text start="619.269" dur="2.82">Fed is already predicting the first</text>
  <text start="620.529" dur="3.36">quarter of this year is going to be</text>
  <text start="622.089" dur="5.571">about 1.2 percent now we have to think</text>
  <text start="623.889" dur="5.581">back because the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="627.66" dur="3.909">governments they were they were all out</text>
  <text start="629.47" dur="4.59">there telling us that the fourth quarter</text>
  <text start="631.569" dur="5.88">of 2015 was going to be three percent</text>
  <text start="634.06" dur="6.509">gdp remember in the beginning of or the</text>
  <text start="637.449" dur="5.25">end of 2014 going into 2015 they said oh</text>
  <text start="640.569" dur="5.971">this economy is going to be doing</text>
  <text start="642.699" dur="8.461">fantastic in 2015 it&amp;#39;s gonna be three</text>
  <text start="646.54" dur="7.89">percent gdp guess what they&amp;#39;re wrong</text>
  <text start="651.16" dur="7.529">again and now they&amp;#39;re saying 2016 is</text>
  <text start="654.43" dur="6.839">going to be incredible three percent gdp</text>
  <text start="658.689" dur="5.311">two and a half percent gdp it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="661.269" dur="9.231">everything is fine and 2017 it&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="664" dur="9.35">better but guess what it&amp;#39;s all wrong</text>
  <text start="670.5" dur="5.829">they&amp;#39;re keeping the illusion alive</text>
  <text start="673.35" dur="5.109">trying to convince everyone by throwing</text>
  <text start="676.329" dur="7.86">out all these predictions and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="678.459" dur="7.951">never right and they know that they need</text>
  <text start="684.189" dur="5.121">to keep the illusion alive they know</text>
  <text start="686.41" dur="5.97">that this entire system is falling apart</text>
  <text start="689.31" dur="7.23">this is why the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="692.38" dur="6.809">calling for a cashless society on the</text>
  <text start="696.54" dur="2.98">x20 report calm and setting alerts if</text>
  <text start="699.189" dur="3.121">you go to</text>
  <text start="699.52" dur="5.4">set an alert today I put up an article</text>
  <text start="702.31" dur="5.97">about Bloomberg with an op-ed which is</text>
  <text start="704.92" dur="5.19">calling for no more cash the end of cash</text>
  <text start="708.28" dur="4.14">and they&amp;#39;re doing this on purpose</text>
  <text start="710.11" dur="4.5">because they&amp;#39;re trying to push this out</text>
  <text start="712.42" dur="3.98">there now convincing everyone we no</text>
  <text start="714.61" dur="4.44">longer need cash and we see a lot of</text>
  <text start="716.4" dur="5.74">countries now looking at this thing okay</text>
  <text start="719.05" dur="5.03">maybe we don&amp;#39;t need cash and the only</text>
  <text start="722.14" dur="6.39">reason they&amp;#39;re doing this is because</text>
  <text start="724.08" dur="7.12">they want to control where the cash is</text>
  <text start="728.53" dur="4.08">they saw what happened in Greece where</text>
  <text start="731.2" dur="4.68">people went to the bank and said okay</text>
  <text start="732.61" dur="5.79">there&amp;#39;s a problem here you were afraid</text>
  <text start="735.88" dur="3.96">of balance we need to take our cash out</text>
  <text start="738.4" dur="3.75">put it under our mattresses that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="739.84" dur="4.35">exactly what they did they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="742.15" dur="5.55">the same thing happening here in the US</text>
  <text start="744.19" dur="4.89">and canada or anywhere else because they</text>

  <text start="824.47" dur="5.76">coinage and what they were doing was</text>
  <text start="828.19" dur="5.25">declaring the old coinage to be invalid</text>
  <text start="830.23" dur="7.83">for paying taxes as a result you had to</text>

  <text start="948.16" dur="4.82">saying it&amp;#39;s going to work out but we see</text>
  <text start="950.35" dur="7.68">from the past this has not happened</text>
  <text start="952.98" dur="8.56">whatsoever right now iran says swift</text>
  <text start="958.03" dur="5.64">opens 29 more banks on monday everything</text>
  <text start="961.54" dur="5.22">went online the sanctions are being</text>
  <text start="963.67" dur="6.39">lifted and iran has</text>
  <text start="966.76" dur="5.67">access to the system now remember all of</text>
  <text start="970.06" dur="6.57">this is being done and the p5 plus one</text>
  <text start="972.43" dur="6.54">talks were done not for nuclear purposes</text>
  <text start="976.63" dur="4.29">this was done because the United States</text>
  <text start="978.97" dur="5.58">needed a way to continually push the</text>
  <text start="980.92" dur="7.23">debt and hopefully place the dollar on</text>
  <text start="984.55" dur="6.18">the oil so every time I ran makes a sale</text>
  <text start="988.15" dur="5.18">they&amp;#39;re going to use the dollar how long</text>
  <text start="990.73" dur="6.39">will this last most likely not that long</text>
  <text start="993.33" dur="5.29">most likely Iran Russia China will say</text>
  <text start="997.12" dur="4.65">well we don&amp;#39;t need to use the dollar</text>
  <text start="998.62" dur="5.67">let&amp;#39;s bypass bypass this and this will</text>
  <text start="1001.77" dur="5.85">be a huge problem and this is one we</text>
  <text start="1004.29" dur="6.9">will be going to war because they will</text>
  <text start="1007.62" dur="6.95">not let this happen now it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1011.19" dur="5.97">interesting is that we always hear these</text>
  <text start="1014.57" dur="6.13">arguments about the debt ceiling the</text>
  <text start="1017.16" dur="6.15">debt limit crisis how the country can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1020.7" dur="6.66">survive unless we raise the ceiling and</text>
  <text start="1023.31" dur="6.99">borrow more money well it seems that we</text>
  <text start="1027.36" dur="5.52">were lied to once again because new</text>
  <text start="1030.3" dur="5.37">documents that were leaked show that the</text>
  <text start="1032.88" dur="4.8">Federal Reserve Bank of New York the</text>
  <text start="1035.67" dur="5.7">officials there they conducted real-time</text>
  <text start="1037.68" dur="7.5">exercises during the 2011 and 2013 debt</text>
  <text start="1041.37" dur="5.76">limit crisis and it demonstrated at that</text>
  <text start="1045.18" dur="5.85">point that the federal government was</text>
  <text start="1047.13" dur="6.78">able to function during a temporary</text>
  <text start="1051.03" dur="7.11">shutdown even though Treasury secretary</text>
  <text start="1053.91" dur="8.48">Jack Lew said yeah this is unworkable we</text>
  <text start="1058.14" dur="6.48">can&amp;#39;t do it but according to new reports</text>
  <text start="1062.39" dur="4.45">from the house financial services</text>
  <text start="1064.62" dur="5.88">committee attained by the Daily Caller</text>

  <text start="1070.5" dur="5.76">other Obama administration officials</text>
  <text start="1073.55" dur="4.3">deliberately misled Congress and the</text>

  <text start="1101.96" dur="6.49">the Treasury Department has obstructed</text>
  <text start="1105.65" dur="7.41">congressional effort to get to the</text>
  <text start="1108.45" dur="6.66">bottom of all of these things and</text>
  <text start="1113.06" dur="5.14">remember the Constitution stipulates</text>
  <text start="1115.11" dur="4.32">that only Congress can determine how</text>
  <text start="1118.2" dur="5.31">much money the federal government can</text>

  <text start="1123.51" dur="6.39">spend beyond congressional debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="1126.12" dur="6.42">limits so the internal documents show</text>
  <text start="1129.9" dur="5.19">that the Obama administration took the</text>
  <text start="1132.54" dur="9.03">nation&amp;#39;s credit worthiness and economy</text>
  <text start="1135.09" dur="8.46">hostage to get what he wanted and it</text>
  <text start="1141.57" dur="5.34">also reveals that the Treasury</text>

  <text start="1154.35" dur="11.63">Congress to pass the debt ceiling and</text>
  <text start="1160.1" dur="10.18">raise it so once again there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1165.98" dur="6.33">transparency once again they&amp;#39;re lying</text>
  <text start="1170.28" dur="7.37">about what&amp;#39;s really going on the economy</text>
  <text start="1172.31" dur="9.97">once again they&amp;#39;re hiding things from</text>
  <text start="1177.65" dur="8.49">everyone to get their way and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1182.28" dur="6.39">starting to see this quite a bit in this</text>
  <text start="1186.14" dur="4.84">government it&amp;#39;s been going on for a very</text>
  <text start="1188.67" dur="3.84">long time and as time goes on it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1190.98" dur="7.23">getting worse and worse and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1192.51" dur="10.44">lie after lie after lie and that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1198.21" dur="8.04">we see the government continuously lies</text>
  <text start="1202.95" dur="6.51">to the people and when you look through</text>
  <text start="1206.25" dur="5.91">the Constitution it doesn&amp;#39;t say anything</text>
  <text start="1209.46" dur="4.59">about lying to the people it says that</text>
  <text start="1212.16" dur="4.71">the government is supposed to be working</text>
  <text start="1214.05" dur="6.72">for the people making it better for the</text>
  <text start="1216.87" dur="5.82">people but as we know the government no</text>

  <text start="1242.97" dur="7.069">they want to do is tax us control us and</text>
  <text start="1250.7" dur="9.099">we can see at this point that it&amp;#39;s time</text>
  <text start="1254.64" dur="9.019">that we take things back into our own</text>
  <text start="1259.799" dur="6.811">hands and we say okay enough is enough</text>
