  <text start="112.509" dur="5.07">news now we&amp;#39;ve been following the</text>
  <text start="115.149" dur="4.83">economy deteriorating for quite a while</text>
  <text start="117.579" dur="3.691">during the Obama administration we</text>
  <text start="119.979" dur="3.39">realize that the economy was</text>
  <text start="121.27" dur="4.889">deteriorating but during that period we</text>
  <text start="123.369" dur="5.731">also understood that the central bank</text>
  <text start="126.159" dur="5.701">they were pumping in you know trillions</text>
  <text start="129.1" dur="5.639">and trillions of dollars into the system</text>
  <text start="131.86" dur="6.48">to pump these bubbles up and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="134.739" dur="6.391">reached a point where the bubbles well</text>
  <text start="138.34" dur="5.369">they&amp;#39;re at their maximum level and</text>
  <text start="141.13" dur="5.43">things are rapidly starting to go wrong</text>
  <text start="143.709" dur="4.741">and we are noticing this now during the</text>
  <text start="146.56" dur="4.89">period where we looked at it during</text>
  <text start="148.45" dur="4.65">Obama we saw it building we saw it</text>
  <text start="151.45" dur="3.81">getting worse we saw retail getting</text>
  <text start="153.1" dur="4.949">worse the GDP numbers continually</text>
  <text start="155.26" dur="3.81">declined unemployment numbers everyone</text>
  <text start="158.049" dur="3.361">was starting to call them out as</text>
  <text start="159.07" dur="4.979">completely fake now nobody even pays</text>
  <text start="161.41" dur="3.93">attention to them and we can see not</text>
  <text start="164.049" dur="3.541">just here in the United States but all</text>
  <text start="165.34" dur="5.429">around the world things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="167.59" dur="6.84">falling apart and it is accelerating to</text>
  <text start="170.769" dur="6.451">the downside out in the eurozone we see</text>
  <text start="174.43" dur="6.8">that eurozone economic confidence well</text>
  <text start="177.22" dur="6.269">it slipped from a deck a decade high</text>
  <text start="181.23" dur="4.93">optimism in the euro area&amp;#39;s economy</text>
  <text start="183.489" dur="3.651">declined unexpectedly in</text>
  <text start="186.16" dur="3.84">I love when they used the word</text>
  <text start="187.14" dur="5.08">unexpectedly it&amp;#39;s not unexpected</text>
  <text start="190" dur="3.6">most of these numbers not just here in</text>
  <text start="192.22" dur="4.26">United States but around the world</text>
  <text start="193.6" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re completely manipulated to make</text>
  <text start="196.48" dur="4.35">it look like things we&amp;#39;re getting better</text>
  <text start="197.77" dur="5.58">I remember back in 2013 when then</text>
  <text start="200.83" dur="4.65">President Hollande in France was saying</text>
  <text start="203.35" dur="4.19">that they were coming out of the</text>
  <text start="205.48" dur="3.99">recession everything was fantastic</text>
  <text start="207.54" dur="3.01">unemployment was going to drop like</text>
  <text start="209.47" dur="3.63">there was no tomorrow</text>
  <text start="210.55" dur="4.86">and nothing really changed in France</text>
  <text start="213.1" dur="3.6">actually the situation got worse then</text>
  <text start="215.41" dur="2.43">they started to manipulate a lot of</text>
  <text start="216.7" dur="3.39">their numbers just like the United</text>
  <text start="217.84" dur="4.02">States did and they try to make everyone</text>
  <text start="220.09" dur="4.26">believe that things were a lot better</text>
  <text start="221.86" dur="5.46">well the European Commission&amp;#39;s index of</text>
  <text start="224.35" dur="5.82">executive and Consumer Sentiment fell to</text>
  <text start="227.32" dur="5.1">a hundred nine point two in May from a</text>
  <text start="230.17" dur="6.36">revised one hundred nine point seven and</text>
  <text start="232.42" dur="6.36">they were expecting a hundred and ten so</text>
  <text start="236.53" dur="4.77">they were way off the services</text>
  <text start="238.78" dur="5.19">confidence indicator dropped to thirteen</text>
  <text start="241.3" dur="5.43">from fourteen point two in April while</text>
  <text start="243.97" dur="4.89">the retail trade confidence index fell</text>
  <text start="246.73" dur="5.91">to two point zero from three point one</text>
  <text start="248.86" dur="5.55">so we could see that things well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="252.64" dur="4.29">not going too well here in the United</text>
  <text start="254.41" dur="4.53">States the consumer confidence this is</text>
  <text start="256.93" dur="4.8">coming from the Conference Board</text>
  <text start="258.94" dur="5.729">consumer confidence and remember this is</text>
  <text start="261.73" dur="4.08">the government consumer confidence they</text>
  <text start="264.669" dur="2.491">give them grants and things like that</text>
  <text start="265.81" dur="4.5">and they do what they want where they</text>
  <text start="267.16" dur="5.94">manipulate the numbers well this is also</text>
  <text start="270.31" dur="6.93">slipping right now to its weakest since</text>
  <text start="273.1" dur="7.35">February and those individuals that were</text>
  <text start="277.24" dur="5.76">surveyed they said you know their dreams</text>
  <text start="280.45" dur="5.25">to buy a home a car maybe a major</text>
  <text start="283" dur="5.04">appliance well they&amp;#39;re not looking to do</text>
  <text start="285.7" dur="5.18">this right now because hope has now</text>
  <text start="288.04" dur="6.45">declined in May to the lowest levels in</text>
  <text start="290.88" dur="6.94">years and this tells me something that</text>
  <text start="294.49" dur="5.28">the powers that are controlling pretty</text>
  <text start="297.82" dur="3.69">much everything right now they are</text>
  <text start="299.77" dur="5.16">trying to make the case that the economy</text>
  <text start="301.51" dur="5.909">now is not doing as well and they will</text>
  <text start="304.93" dur="5.82">continually do this now we are now</text>
  <text start="307.419" dur="6.931">entering June and they&amp;#39;re going to start</text>
  <text start="310.75" dur="6.39">the idea that the economy isn&amp;#39;t doing as</text>
  <text start="314.35" dur="4.53">well they&amp;#39;ve been looking at the stock</text>
  <text start="317.14" dur="2.88">market they&amp;#39;ve been talking about how</text>
  <text start="318.88" dur="3.3">Trump</text>
  <text start="320.02" dur="4.14">you know has been building the market up</text>
  <text start="322.18" dur="4.47">this way they could say Trump is going</text>
  <text start="324.16" dur="5.46">to bring the market down this is all in</text>
  <text start="326.65" dur="5.46">preparation to blame this on Trump now</text>
  <text start="329.62" dur="5.28">what is happening in the economy is the</text>
  <text start="332.11" dur="5.19">economy was built on an illusion the</text>
  <text start="334.9" dur="5.6">illusion well it&amp;#39;s being stripped away</text>
  <text start="337.3" dur="7.35">right now and what is happening is that</text>
  <text start="340.5" dur="7.389">the personal spending of individuals</text>
  <text start="344.65" dur="6.299">that has dropped on a year-to-year basis</text>
  <text start="347.889" dur="5.881">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="350.949" dur="4.051">it is the weakest since September of</text>
  <text start="353.77" dur="3.54">2016</text>
  <text start="355" dur="5.31">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is this</text>
  <text start="357.31" dur="5.37">rollover of people saying you know</text>
  <text start="360.31" dur="5.13">something I just don&amp;#39;t have the money to</text>
  <text start="362.68" dur="4.769">do this I can&amp;#39;t go out and spend and we</text>
  <text start="365.44" dur="5.099">can see that these numbers are being</text>
  <text start="367.449" dur="5.551">revised to make it look a lot better</text>
  <text start="370.539" dur="5.91">than it is now the reason they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="373" dur="5.159">this and this is going back to January</text>
  <text start="376.449" dur="4.921">where they started to revise all the</text>
  <text start="378.159" dur="5.88">numbers on spending it&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="381.37" dur="4.979">trying to make the case where the Fed</text>
  <text start="384.039" dur="4.56">will be able to raise the interest rates</text>
  <text start="386.349" dur="4.081">and this is why they&amp;#39;re doing all these</text>
  <text start="388.599" dur="4.38">revisions and manipulating these numbers</text>
  <text start="390.43" dur="4.44">to make it look like the economy is</text>
  <text start="392.979" dur="3.93">doing well the Fed is going to go off</text>
  <text start="394.87" dur="3.84">these numbers they&amp;#39;re going to say this</text>
  <text start="396.909" dur="4.111">is one this is we&amp;#39;re going to raise the</text>
  <text start="398.71" dur="6.929">interest rates according to the data and</text>
  <text start="401.02" dur="9.66">in reality behind the scenes these</text>
  <text start="405.639" dur="7.71">numbers are absolutely awful now to push</text>
  <text start="410.68" dur="5.849">this ahead a little bit further they</text>
  <text start="413.349" dur="5.641">needed to rework the credit scores now</text>
  <text start="416.529" dur="5.221">fair Isaac the company behind the FICO</text>
  <text start="418.99" dur="5.489">score that determines every consumers</text>
  <text start="421.75" dur="5.25">credit rating will stop including its</text>
  <text start="424.479" dur="5.31">FICO credit score calculations any</text>
  <text start="427" dur="4.849">record of consumer failing to pay a bill</text>
  <text start="429.789" dur="6.03">if the bill has been paid or settled</text>
  <text start="431.849" dur="6.1">with a collection agency so basically</text>
  <text start="435.819" dur="4.201">what they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re also going to</text>
  <text start="437.949" dur="4.97">give less weight to unpaid medical bills</text>
  <text start="440.02" dur="5.94">that are with a collection agency in</text>
  <text start="442.919" dur="6.691">doing all of this the company would make</text>
  <text start="445.96" dur="7.77">it easier for about 10 million</text>
  <text start="449.61" dur="7.06">individuals to get loans now remember</text>
  <text start="453.73" dur="6.12">the central bank needs people to go out</text>
  <text start="456.67" dur="6.3">and they need them to take on more debt</text>
  <text start="459.85" dur="6.21">this is the way the system operates so</text>
  <text start="462.97" dur="4.41">by doing this they&amp;#39;re allowing people to</text>
  <text start="466.06" dur="4.11">take on more debt</text>
  <text start="467.38" dur="4.65">remember the central bank wants to bring</text>
  <text start="470.17" dur="4.38">the economy down right now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="472.03" dur="4.17">entering June this is the start of where</text>
  <text start="474.55" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re going to make the case of the</text>
  <text start="476.2" dur="2.91">economy is going to start falling apart</text>
  <text start="478.09" dur="3.33">you&amp;#39;re going to hear a lot in the</text>
  <text start="479.11" dur="4.53">corporate media but things aren&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="481.42" dur="4.71">as well because they feel they&amp;#39;ve given</text>
  <text start="483.64" dur="5.1">Trump a long period of time here long</text>
  <text start="486.13" dur="4.11">enough actually where his policies</text>
  <text start="488.74" dur="3.93">whatever he&amp;#39;s been doing which is pretty</text>
  <text start="490.24" dur="4.05">much of nothing in regards to the</text>
  <text start="492.67" dur="3.33">economy except blowing up more and more</text>
  <text start="494.29" dur="3.09">bubbles and this is being done on</text>
  <text start="496" dur="3.06">purpose to bring the economy down</text>
  <text start="497.38" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re going to try to make the case</text>
  <text start="499.06" dur="5.01">that because of what he&amp;#39;s been doing the</text>
  <text start="502.18" dur="5.45">economy is failing now we&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="504.07" dur="6.78">going to see this ramp up in August but</text>
  <text start="507.63" dur="5.26">from now until August they need to keep</text>
  <text start="510.85" dur="3.72">the economy going they need to pee they</text>
  <text start="512.89" dur="3.87">need to keep people out there spending</text>
  <text start="514.57" dur="5.159">they need to make sure that money is</text>
  <text start="516.76" dur="5.61">going into retail flowing out they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="519.729" dur="6.511">getting people into more and more debt</text>
  <text start="522.37" dur="7.08">so what else did they do well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="526.24" dur="5.37">also going to remove tax liens and civil</text>
  <text start="529.45" dur="4.41">judgments they&amp;#39;ll be removed from</text>
  <text start="531.61" dur="7.02">people&amp;#39;s credit reports and this will</text>
  <text start="533.86" dur="8.28">allow these individuals to go out borrow</text>
  <text start="538.63" dur="5.82">funds get credit cards to keep the</text>
  <text start="542.14" dur="5.37">system going a little bit longer is this</text>
  <text start="544.45" dur="5.19">going to help the economy no it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="547.51" dur="5.94">going to allow people to take on more</text>
  <text start="549.64" dur="8.31">debt yes and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="553.45" dur="7.32">this whole idea of allowing this to</text>
  <text start="557.95" dur="6.09">happen is to keep the economy chugging</text>
  <text start="560.77" dur="5.04">along for a little while longer so they</text>
  <text start="564.04" dur="5.07">can then bring it down it sounds</text>
  <text start="565.81" dur="6.77">ridiculous but the central bank wants</text>
  <text start="569.11" dur="7.17">everyone in they want everyone in and</text>
  <text start="572.58" dur="5.08">everyone has to be strapped with debt</text>
  <text start="576.28" dur="3.54">because this is the way their system</text>
  <text start="577.66" dur="4.68">works this way they can control the</text>
  <text start="579.82" dur="4.77">people because when you&amp;#39;re in debt guess</text>
  <text start="582.34" dur="4.62">what happens they can control you you</text>
  <text start="584.59" dur="3.059">need to pay that debt back and if you</text>
  <text start="586.96" dur="4.289">can&amp;#39;t pay</text>
  <text start="587.649" dur="6.99">back well we come after your assets this</text>
  <text start="591.249" dur="5.911">is what they want now we see that home</text>
  <text start="594.639" dur="5.781">prices they are skyrocketing right now</text>
  <text start="597.16" dur="6.869">in the 20 cities Case Shiller is</text>
  <text start="600.42" dur="8.169">reporting that houses are moving up and</text>
  <text start="604.029" dur="6.36">they rose in value by 5.8 5.8 9 percent</text>
  <text start="608.589" dur="4.92">year-on-year this is the strongest</text>
  <text start="610.389" dur="10.411">growth since 2014 now they have just</text>
  <text start="613.509" dur="9.841">passed the period back in 2004 5 &amp;amp; 6</text>
  <text start="620.8" dur="6.839">where the bubble hit the top we just</text>
  <text start="623.35" dur="7.14">went over that so they have completed</text>
  <text start="627.639" dur="6.151">the mission of blowing a bubble up and</text>
  <text start="630.49" dur="4.709">the bubble is getting ready to beep up</text>
  <text start="633.79" dur="3.87">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing in many of</text>
  <text start="635.199" dur="5.221">many of the other areas is that the</text>
  <text start="637.66" dur="6">housing market is not where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="640.42" dur="5.399">saying it is I&amp;#39;m saying in outside the</text>
  <text start="643.66" dur="4.409">20 cities house prices are coming down</text>
  <text start="645.819" dur="4.02">houses are still staying on the market</text>
  <text start="648.069" dur="4.171">longer and longer and longer and people</text>
  <text start="649.839" dur="6.031">are having a very difficult time selling</text>
  <text start="652.24" dur="7.289">them now the corporate debt bomb it is</text>
  <text start="655.87" dur="6.36">ticking and we can see we are in big</text>
  <text start="659.529" dur="5.071">trouble corporate profits right now they</text>
  <text start="662.23" dur="4.62">are rolling over two years ago</text>
  <text start="664.6" dur="4.26">corporations posted their first year</text>
  <text start="666.85" dur="4.62">negative profit growth since the great</text>
  <text start="668.86" dur="4.949">crisis we had a bounce from those</text>
  <text start="671.47" dur="3.539">depressed levels which suckered a lot of</text>

  <text start="909.55" dur="4.88">according to the managers of the new</text>
  <text start="912.04" dur="6.78">system and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="914.43" dur="6.04">they are prepared to back their system</text>
  <text start="918.82" dur="5.49">with gold and they&amp;#39;re using crypto</text>
  <text start="920.47" dur="5.79">currencies to do this with now there are</text>
  <text start="924.31" dur="3.9">individuals out there saying that crypto</text>
  <text start="926.26" dur="4.5">currencies this is going to be the new</text>
  <text start="928.21" dur="3.92">wave of what currencies are going to be</text>
  <text start="930.76" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;re going to be decentralized</text>
  <text start="932.13" dur="4.33">they&amp;#39;re not going to be controlled by</text>
  <text start="934.06" dur="4.62">the banking system actually we might not</text>
  <text start="936.46" dur="4.05">even need the banking systems you might</text>
  <text start="938.68" dur="4.23">just have loan centers or things like</text>
  <text start="940.51" dur="6.06">that the currencies are created without</text>
  <text start="942.91" dur="6.63">interest whatsoever and they might be</text>
  <text start="946.57" dur="4.59">back with gold maybe we don&amp;#39;t know as of</text>
  <text start="949.54" dur="6.27">yet we see one system that is out there</text>
  <text start="951.16" dur="8.37">but we can see that as the dollar dies</text>
  <text start="955.81" dur="7.5">as this central currency controlled by a</text>
  <text start="959.53" dur="5.73">central bank dies we see countries are</text>
  <text start="963.31" dur="5.1">preparing and getting ready for</text>
  <text start="965.26" dur="5.52">something new and there has to be</text>
  <text start="968.41" dur="5.37">something and this is why you need to be</text>
  <text start="970.78" dur="4.86">ready and prepared silver yes you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="973.78" dur="3.84">going to need cash on hand for the</text>
  <text start="975.64" dur="3.87">bidding for the beginning stage of the</text>
  <text start="977.62" dur="3.48">collapse because people the</text>
  <text start="979.51" dur="3.48">cryptocurrency and everything will not</text>
  <text start="981.1" dur="4.44">be up and running people will still</text>
  <text start="982.99" dur="4.29">accept cash as it continually loses its</text>
  <text start="985.54" dur="2.05">value then there&amp;#39;ll be a certain point</text>
  <text start="987.28" dur="2.8">will</text>
  <text start="987.59" dur="4.82">no longer use cash you might barter for</text>
  <text start="990.08" dur="5.79">a little while then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="992.41" dur="4.57">countries will start using different</text>
  <text start="995.87" dur="4.26">systems maybe a gold-backed</text>
  <text start="996.98" dur="5.64">cryptocurrency or a different type of</text>

  <text start="1002.62" dur="5.73">don&amp;#39;t know as of yet and they might say</text>
  <text start="1005.29" dur="6.09">this will be the currency of the country</text>
  <text start="1008.35" dur="5.64">and each country most likely will be</text>
  <text start="1011.38" dur="5.37">taking on one of these type of systems</text>
  <text start="1013.99" dur="4.47">and then will will be traded and we can</text>
  <text start="1016.75" dur="3.33">see right now until we get to that stage</text>
