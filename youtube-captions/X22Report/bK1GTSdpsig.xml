  <text start="163.84" dur="6.36">this year of 2015 and we move into 2016</text>
  <text start="166.54" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s just going to get worse and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="170.2" dur="6.81">starting to see that all of these</text>
  <text start="172.15" dur="7.08">bubbles they are looking a lot like 2008</text>
  <text start="177.01" dur="6.57">right now especially in the auto</text>
  <text start="179.23" dur="7.74">industry skopos financial the subprime</text>
  <text start="183.58" dur="6.03">auto lender they&amp;#39;ve been busy packaging</text>
  <text start="186.97" dur="5.64">all manner of questionable auto loans</text>
  <text start="189.61" dur="6.84">and offloading credit risk to investors</text>
  <text start="192.61" dur="8.209">sounds very familiar to two thousand six</text>
  <text start="196.45" dur="7.02">seven eight with the housing market I</text>
  <text start="200.819" dur="4.78">mean scopo sold about a hundred and</text>
  <text start="203.47" dur="4.92">fifty million worth of paper back by a</text>
  <text start="205.599" dur="4.321">collateral pool wherein twenty percent</text>
  <text start="208.39" dur="3.569">of the loans were made up were made to</text>
  <text start="209.92" dur="6.78">borrowers with credit scores ranging</text>
  <text start="211.959" dur="7.89">from 351 to 500 in other words a fifth</text>
  <text start="216.7" dur="5.16">of the loans backing the deal are the</text>
  <text start="219.849" dur="6.631">least cruddy worth creditworthy</text>
  <text start="221.86" dur="6.659">borrowers in the country and if we look</text>
  <text start="226.48" dur="6">at these auto loans we see that an</text>
  <text start="228.519" dur="6.12">average loan term for new cars is 67</text>
  <text start="232.48" dur="6.27">months I mean I remember when it was 36</text>
  <text start="234.639" dur="7.051">months then 48 then 60 we&amp;#39;re hitting 67</text>
  <text start="238.75" dur="7.56">now on used cars it&amp;#39;s up to sixty two</text>
  <text start="241.69" dur="9.21">months loans with terms from 74 to 84</text>
  <text start="246.31" dur="10.19">months are now up thirty percent I mean</text>
  <text start="250.9" dur="10.8">these are all new records and America&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="256.5" dur="11.8">auto loan bubble has reached 1.1</text>
  <text start="261.7" dur="10.37">trillion dollars I mean back in 2011 the</text>
  <text start="268.3" dur="6.299">whole reason this skopos financial</text>
  <text start="272.07" dur="6.25">institution opened its doors they had</text>
  <text start="274.599" dur="7.621">one goal in mind and that was to go</text>
  <text start="278.32" dur="6.659">after the deep subprime auto loan make</text>
  <text start="282.22" dur="8.19">it easier for people to get financing</text>
  <text start="284.979" dur="7.531">and then package these loans seems very</text>
  <text start="290.41" dur="5.46">very familiar to the housing practice</text>
  <text start="292.51" dur="5.26">that we saw before 2008 when everything</text>
  <text start="295.87" dur="4.99">came crashing down</text>
  <text start="297.77" dur="5.13">and it seems like this is all part of</text>
  <text start="300.86" dur="4.8">the same thing right now because they</text>
  <text start="302.9" dur="5.699">need to keep these bubbles continually</text>
  <text start="305.66" dur="5.999">inflating and you know what happens to</text>
  <text start="308.599" dur="5.82">bubbles eventually they pop we can</text>
  <text start="311.659" dur="5.63">pretend we can make up all different</text>
  <text start="314.419" dur="6.541">reasonings why they won&amp;#39;t but in the end</text>
  <text start="317.289" dur="6.1">the same thing always happens we saw it</text>
  <text start="320.96" dur="5.01">in 2008 everyone was telling us it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="323.389" dur="5.551">impossible to happen housing never goes</text>
  <text start="325.97" dur="5.55">down there is no bubble there is no</text>
  <text start="328.94" dur="4.199">recession the forecast and the model</text>
  <text start="331.52" dur="5.34">show us that there&amp;#39;s absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="333.139" dur="5.551">and this was the same year the Fed was</text>
  <text start="336.86" dur="3.6">telling us that there&amp;#39;s no problems</text>
  <text start="338.69" dur="4.37">everything&amp;#39;s contained when the whole</text>
  <text start="340.46" dur="7.22">entire market came crashing down</text>
  <text start="343.06" dur="9.509">Manufacturing is continually declining</text>
  <text start="347.68" dur="4.889">we have seen no improvement whatsoever</text>
  <text start="352.81" dur="6.55">what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is people are not</text>
  <text start="356.84" dur="6.24">purchasing goods there&amp;#39;s no reason to</text>
  <text start="359.36" dur="7.109">manufacture the Baltic Dry Index it</text>
  <text start="363.08" dur="5.25">dropped again by 23 points now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="366.469" dur="3.961">down to six hundred and fifty seven and</text>
  <text start="368.33" dur="4.5">for those people who don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="370.43" dur="7.769">this this is the raw material the</text>
  <text start="372.83" dur="9.92">factories use to create products to ship</text>
  <text start="378.199" dur="8.011">out to stores to other businesses and</text>
  <text start="382.75" dur="4.84">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the factories</text>
  <text start="386.21" dur="3.179">don&amp;#39;t have to produce anything because</text>
  <text start="387.59" dur="6.829">people aren&amp;#39;t purchasing businesses are</text>
  <text start="389.389" dur="7.83">not purchasing and normally at this time</text>
  <text start="394.419" dur="5.831">approaching this holiday season the</text>
  <text start="397.219" dur="8.82">Baltic Dry Index is fourteen fifteen</text>
  <text start="400.25" dur="7.74">sixteen hundred points factories are</text>
  <text start="406.039" dur="4.591">producing building up inventories</text>
  <text start="407.99" dur="5.91">getting ready for the holiday season we</text>
  <text start="410.63" dur="6.3">are not seeing this whatsoever the</text>
  <text start="413.9" dur="6.54">housing market right now is continually</text>
  <text start="416.93" dur="6.81">falling apart the number of mortgage</text>
  <text start="420.44" dur="6.81">applications in the US fell for a second</text>
  <text start="423.74" dur="5.909">straight week we started last week a</text>
  <text start="427.25" dur="3.97">three-point-five percent decline this</text>
  <text start="429.649" dur="4.961">week it&amp;#39;s a point eight percent</text>
  <text start="431.22" dur="5.97">decline and you have to remember this is</text>
  <text start="434.61" dur="4.83">when interest rates are at their lowest</text>
  <text start="437.19" dur="5.28">oh yeah of course they can go to</text>
  <text start="439.44" dur="5.73">negative but think about this for a</text>
  <text start="442.47" dur="5.49">second if interest rates went up just a</text>
  <text start="445.17" dur="5.46">little bit it would knock so many people</text>
  <text start="447.96" dur="6.21">out of the market applications will</text>
  <text start="450.63" dur="6.69">completely crumble apart and the whole</text>
  <text start="454.17" dur="6.09">thing would just implode and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="457.32" dur="5.85">starting to see ripples and cracks in</text>
  <text start="460.26" dur="6.57">the real estate market we already see</text>
  <text start="463.17" dur="5.22">that houses their prices they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="466.83" dur="3.57">leveling off and starting to come down</text>
  <text start="468.39" dur="3.9">houses are being are staying on the</text>
  <text start="470.4" dur="3.48">market longer and lager now is this</text>
  <text start="472.29" dur="4.32">happening in every single place it</text>
  <text start="473.88" dur="4.83">doesn&amp;#39;t happen in the country all at the</text>
  <text start="476.61" dur="5.37">same time in every single place that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="478.71" dur="5.67">just absolutely ridiculous so yes we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="481.98" dur="5.55">going to see pockets where these things</text>
  <text start="484.38" dur="5.31">start to occur where the prices level</text>
  <text start="487.53" dur="4.139">off they start dropping it gets harder</text>
  <text start="489.69" dur="3.479">and harder to sell homes then it spreads</text>
  <text start="491.669" dur="4.531">to the rest of the country we saw this</text>
  <text start="493.169" dur="4.321">back in two thousand eight where one</text>
  <text start="496.2" dur="3.41">part of the country was doing absolutely</text>
  <text start="497.49" dur="5.63">fine and other parts of the country</text>
  <text start="499.61" dur="6.67">people were just leaving their homes and</text>
  <text start="503.12" dur="5.59">then guess what happened it spread all</text>
  <text start="506.28" dur="5.01">over the place we are seeing the same</text>
  <text start="508.71" dur="5.4">thing right now now we know that Fannie</text>

  <text start="539.97" dur="11.07">learn that Fannie and Freddie are now at</text>
  <text start="544.89" dur="9.78">risk how could this be right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="551.04" dur="8.36">saying they might need an injection from</text>
  <text start="554.67" dur="10.19">the Treasury because they had a</text>
  <text start="559.4" dur="8.88">quarterly loss and this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="564.86" dur="6.09">right now they&amp;#39;re calculating on their</text>
  <text start="568.28" dur="6.89">third quarter loss of about 475 million</text>

  <text start="575.17" dur="10">number is low right now you know this is</text>
  <text start="580.25" dur="9.3">going to increase as time goes on so</text>

  <text start="613.34" dur="6.3">doing it before they&amp;#39;re tapering off and</text>
  <text start="616.85" dur="4.35">they were hoping that the American</text>

  <text start="654.08" dur="5.16">weeks from different Fred Chiefs saying</text>
  <text start="656.72" dur="4.64">that negative interest rates might be</text>
  <text start="659.24" dur="5.39">something we might want to look at and</text>
  <text start="661.36" dur="8.35">all of a sudden Yellen comes out and</text>
  <text start="664.63" dur="9.34">says if the outlook worsens the Fed</text>
  <text start="669.71" dur="5.64">might weigh negative rates so a couple</text>

  <text start="680.57" dur="5.43">could be a possibility Yellen comes out</text>
  <text start="683.06" dur="4.58">and says yes if the outlook worsen so</text>
  <text start="686" dur="3.95">wait a minute let me get this straight</text>
  <text start="687.64" dur="5.77">from the Fed minutes they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="689.95" dur="6.22">unemployment looks good housing looks</text>
  <text start="693.41" dur="5.22">like it&amp;#39;s recovering retail two thumbs</text>

  <text start="698.63" dur="5.46">like it&amp;#39;s on the right path everything</text>
  <text start="700.1" dur="8.58">strong why in the world with the Fed all</text>
  <text start="704.09" dur="8.1">of a sudden come out and say okay if the</text>
  <text start="708.68" dur="5.19">outlook on the economy starts to worsen</text>
  <text start="712.19" dur="3.93">we might have to go negative that</text>
  <text start="713.87" dur="4.44">doesn&amp;#39;t even make sense because the</text>
  <text start="716.12" dur="3.36">unemployment right now if you believe</text>
  <text start="718.31" dur="5.43">the government is at five point one</text>

  <text start="729.38" dur="8.04">started next year and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="733.25" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;re worried and Yellin was also out</text>
  <text start="737.42" dur="5.12">there saying negative rates could help</text>
  <text start="739.07" dur="7.05">encourage banks to lend with a negative</text>
  <text start="742.54" dur="5.11">interest rate I don&amp;#39;t know have a hard</text>
  <text start="746.12" dur="5.4">time wrapping my brain around this one</text>

  <text start="1043.66" dur="5">time goes on now we understand Obama is</text>
  <text start="1046.42" dur="6.65">continually bringing in the illegals and</text>
  <text start="1048.66" dur="6.79">a recently leaked internal DHS</text>
  <text start="1053.07" dur="4.87">memorandum has now revealed that the</text>

  <text start="1087.94" dur="7.02">another hearing in August and still it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1090.01" dur="9.3">still standing and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1094.96" dur="5.33">right now is that what Obama is trying</text>
  <text start="1099.31" dur="5.18">to do</text>
  <text start="1100.29" dur="6.36">is in direct violation of Congress&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1106.65" dur="7.62">works to dramatically subvert our</text>

  <text start="1136.11" dur="5.07">can still go and work I mean which is</text>
  <text start="1138.99" dur="4.73">absolutely ridiculous so we can see</text>
  <text start="1141.18" dur="6.51">right now all of this is being done to</text>
