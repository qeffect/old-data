  <text start="41.46" dur="6.05">episode is cash is flowing out of Europe</text>
  <text start="44.43" dur="5.79">and into the bricks emerging markets</text>
  <text start="47.51" dur="6.009">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="50.22" dur="5.94">financial news now today we can see the</text>
  <text start="53.519" dur="4.801">market was kind of flat today yesterday</text>
  <text start="56.16" dur="4.32">we had gold rising today it was</text>
  <text start="58.32" dur="4.05">suppressed a little bit and we can see</text>
  <text start="60.48" dur="3.84">that gold is holding its own it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="62.37" dur="4.56">staying above thirteen hundred dollars</text>
  <text start="64.32" dur="5.79">we see the market is pretty much staying</text>
  <text start="66.93" dur="7.76">flat for the time being and we can see</text>
  <text start="70.11" dur="8.67">right now that the world is preparing</text>
  <text start="74.69" dur="6.13">for this major collapse now we all</text>
  <text start="78.78" dur="4.29">understand because we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="80.82" dur="4.92">the economic indicators for quite a</text>
  <text start="83.07" dur="6.63">while we understand that retail is</text>
  <text start="85.74" dur="5.31">contracting GDP is manipulated we have</text>
  <text start="89.7" dur="6.54">no more manufacturing in the United</text>
  <text start="91.05" dur="9.24">States we see that housing the bubbles</text>
  <text start="96.24" dur="7.14">are now popping and we can see at this</text>
  <text start="100.29" dur="6.57">point the United States government these</text>
  <text start="103.38" dur="5.91">central bankers they are trying whatever</text>
  <text start="106.86" dur="5.84">they possibly can do to convince the</text>
  <text start="109.29" dur="8.46">world that this economy is doing very</text>
  <text start="112.7" dur="7.87">well that there&amp;#39;s no problems and when</text>
  <text start="117.75" dur="6.32">we look throughout Europe when we look</text>
  <text start="120.57" dur="8.07">at the United States we can see that</text>
  <text start="124.07" dur="8.16">each one of the economies is trending</text>
  <text start="128.64" dur="6.27">downwards if we look at the UK right now</text>
  <text start="132.23" dur="6.37">we&amp;#39;re getting word and this is coming</text>
  <text start="134.91" dur="7.049">from market that the UK is heading for a</text>
  <text start="138.6" dur="6.75">recession because we&amp;#39;re seeing that GDP</text>
  <text start="141.959" dur="6.181">is contracting by 0.4% and has in the</text>
  <text start="145.35" dur="6.69">third quarter manufacturing PMI that is</text>
  <text start="148.14" dur="9.26">tumbled from 52.1 to 49.1 the service</text>
  <text start="152.04" dur="8.28">PMI has plunged from 52.3 to 47.4 and</text>
  <text start="157.4" dur="5.89">this is the lowest print in eighty eight</text>
  <text start="160.32" dur="4.2">months but what we can see of course</text>
  <text start="163.29" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;re saying that this is all</text>
  <text start="164.52" dur="3.42">brexit but what we can see when we look</text>
  <text start="166.47" dur="3.93">at the graph and we look at the</text>
  <text start="167.94" dur="6.39">information it has always been on a</text>
  <text start="170.4" dur="6.9">downward trend nothing new here but of</text>
  <text start="174.33" dur="6.09">course the central bankers the US</text>
  <text start="177.3" dur="4.98">government the corporate media they all</text>
  <text start="180.42" dur="5.85">have the excuse now which is called the</text>
  <text start="182.28" dur="5.7">brexit here in the United States we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="186.27" dur="3.57">seeing the same exact thing there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="187.98" dur="3.48">really no difference but of course what</text>
  <text start="189.84" dur="3.93">we have is the United States government</text>
  <text start="191.46" dur="6.02">central bankers manipulating the stock</text>
  <text start="193.77" dur="6.27">market manipulating and suppressing gold</text>
  <text start="197.48" dur="4.75">manipulating a lot of the statistics to</text>
  <text start="200.04" dur="5.91">convince the population that everything</text>
  <text start="202.23" dur="7.35">is fine but we see more and more layoffs</text>
  <text start="205.95" dur="5.46">that are continuing energy giant shalam</text>
  <text start="209.58" dur="4.29">burger they&amp;#39;re firing another eight</text>
  <text start="211.41" dur="3.96">thousand people because market</text>
  <text start="213.87" dur="6.06">conditions have worsened in the second</text>
  <text start="215.37" dur="8.4">quarter and as time goes on everything</text>
  <text start="219.93" dur="7.08">continually gets worse now when we look</text>
  <text start="223.77" dur="6.689">at the Millennials this might be the</text>
  <text start="227.01" dur="6.9">first generation that will have a lower</text>
  <text start="230.459" dur="5.881">lifetime earnings than any other</text>
  <text start="233.91" dur="4.53">generation and we have to remember</text>
  <text start="236.34" dur="5.58">something very important and I was</text>
  <text start="238.44" dur="5.64">speaking to an older gentleman I mean</text>
  <text start="241.92" dur="5.76">I&amp;#39;m 50 right now and I was talking to</text>
  <text start="244.08" dur="7.17">someone who is close to 80 at this point</text>
  <text start="247.68" dur="4.74">and he holds seminars and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="251.25" dur="4.26">interesting because I didn&amp;#39;t realize</text>
  <text start="252.42" dur="5.51">that he did this he holds seminars where</text>
  <text start="255.51" dur="5.88">he talks about the economic collapse and</text>
  <text start="257.93" dur="4.87">he was telling the people you know what</text>
  <text start="261.39" dur="2.88">you need to do you need to buy gold you</text>
  <text start="262.8" dur="4.59">need to buy silver you need to get</text>
  <text start="264.27" dur="5.43">prepared most of the people have a very</text>
  <text start="267.39" dur="4.56">difficult time hearing this he says and</text>
  <text start="269.7" dur="4.469">I agree with him because many people</text>
  <text start="271.95" dur="4.44">they shut down they don&amp;#39;t want to hear</text>
  <text start="274.169" dur="3.901">about any of this but we agreed on many</text>
  <text start="276.39" dur="5.37">of the points where yes the economy is</text>
  <text start="278.07" dur="8.04">coming down it is getting worse and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="281.76" dur="6.54">saying that today the generation that is</text>
  <text start="286.11" dur="6.39">out there right now is having a much</text>
  <text start="288.3" dur="5.49">tougher time and he says every single</text>
  <text start="292.5" dur="5.82">time and he&amp;#39;s been in the financial</text>
  <text start="293.79" dur="8.49">industry for over 50 years every single</text>
  <text start="298.32" dur="10.29">time it throughout history he says the</text>
  <text start="302.28" dur="9.24">Fiat system in the beginning everyone</text>
  <text start="308.61" dur="6.27">feels incredibly well everyone feels</text>
  <text start="311.52" dur="6.75">that the entire system is working for</text>
  <text start="314.88" dur="5.94">them because as we know since 1971 when</text>
  <text start="318.27" dur="6.14">we came off the gold standard all of a</text>
  <text start="320.82" dur="8.52">sudden wages doubled housing prices</text>
  <text start="324.41" dur="7.87">inflated people felt good everything was</text>
  <text start="329.34" dur="5.1">going perfectly then you moved into the</text>
  <text start="332.28" dur="5.61">80s where they took the interest rates</text>
  <text start="334.44" dur="6.36">back down you have that mill period of</text>
  <text start="337.89" dur="6.9">growth and then he says as we get to the</text>
  <text start="340.8" dur="7.17">end game there are certain areas that</text>
  <text start="344.79" dur="5.01">you can see how things start to form</text>
  <text start="347.97" dur="4.62">because in the beginning you have</text>
  <text start="349.8" dur="5.46">inflation and your wages inflate with it</text>
  <text start="352.59" dur="3.99">so if you bought a house for twenty</text>
  <text start="355.26" dur="3.45">thousand dollars back in nineteen</text>
  <text start="356.58" dur="5.22">seventy all of a sudden inflated to</text>
  <text start="358.71" dur="6.63">90,000 very quickly and your salary did</text>
  <text start="361.8" dur="7.4">the same when the system comes down and</text>
  <text start="365.34" dur="7.67">we&amp;#39;re at the end game period wages are</text>
  <text start="369.2" dur="8.38">flat or decline which we&amp;#39;re seeing now</text>
  <text start="373.01" dur="7.36">inflation continually moves up which we</text>
  <text start="377.58" dur="5.31">are seeing now they&amp;#39;re holding it at bay</text>
  <text start="380.37" dur="4.71">by lowering the fuel costs so this way</text>
  <text start="382.89" dur="5.25">producers don&amp;#39;t have to continually</text>
  <text start="385.08" dur="5.58">raise their prices this is one way</text>
  <text start="388.14" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re fighting it the other way</text>
  <text start="390.66" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re fighting it is they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="392.13" dur="5.67">letting the currency that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="394.08" dur="4.98">creating enter the system to circulate</text>
  <text start="397.8" dur="3.63">more currency because more currency</text>
  <text start="399.06" dur="6.35">that&amp;#39;s in the system d values the</text>
  <text start="401.43" dur="6.72">currency so they have that part</text>
  <text start="405.41" dur="5.05">manipulated and controlled but</text>
  <text start="408.15" dur="4.62">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen as the</text>
  <text start="410.46" dur="4.77">system dies is that wages will</text>
  <text start="412.77" dur="4.95">continually decline and inflation will</text>
  <text start="415.23" dur="5.61">take effect as we&amp;#39;re seeing in Venezuela</text>
  <text start="417.72" dur="6.36">as we&amp;#39;ve seen in Greece as we&amp;#39;ve seen in</text>
  <text start="420.84" dur="9.6">many countries and the Millennials right</text>
  <text start="424.08" dur="7.68">now they are stuck with so much student</text>
  <text start="430.44" dur="4.53">loan debt</text>
  <text start="431.76" dur="7.23">with nose prospects of getting good jobs</text>
  <text start="434.97" dur="7.77">that it&amp;#39;s going to be a nightmare for</text>
  <text start="438.99" dur="7.37">the next generation and if you look</text>
  <text start="442.74" dur="7.5">right now the Millennials they have more</text>
  <text start="446.36" dur="9.73">student loan debt than any generation</text>
  <text start="450.24" dur="7.34">before them this is a complete na yaar</text>
  <text start="456.09" dur="5.58">and this is coming from the pew research</text>
  <text start="457.58" dur="7.53">center because generated Millennials had</text>
  <text start="461.67" dur="5.82">45 41-percent debt in education</text>
  <text start="465.11" dur="4.78">Generation X twenty-six percent baby</text>
  <text start="467.49" dur="5.64">boomers thirteen percent the Silent</text>
  <text start="469.89" dur="5.52">Generation three percent and as we move</text>
  <text start="473.13" dur="4.4">forward this is just going to get worse</text>
  <text start="475.41" dur="5.58">and as we know we discussed it before</text>
  <text start="477.53" dur="5.8">amazon is ending in to the market of the</text>
  <text start="480.99" dur="3.72">student loan business and of course we</text>
  <text start="483.33" dur="2.82">know why they&amp;#39;re doing this because</text>
  <text start="484.71" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re getting ready to blow up the</text>
  <text start="486.15" dur="5.82">bubble and one of the areas that he said</text>
  <text start="490.32" dur="3.69">is a good place to escape to is</text>
  <text start="491.97" dur="4.92">Singapore and I said there&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="494.01" dur="6">place I like is a new zealand and we had</text>
  <text start="496.89" dur="5.25">a very lengthy discussion and he was</text>
  <text start="500.01" dur="4.98">telling me that he believes that the</text>
  <text start="502.14" dur="5.94">economy most likely will come down in</text>
  <text start="504.99" dur="5.73">this fall i said it&amp;#39;s a good possibility</text>
  <text start="508.08" dur="4.67">and he says if it doesn&amp;#39;t come down in</text>
  <text start="510.72" dur="4.53">the fall it will be the first quarter of</text>
  <text start="512.75" dur="5.02">2017 which I found very interesting</text>
  <text start="515.25" dur="5.09">because this coincides with what a lot</text>
  <text start="517.77" dur="4.98">of people are saying right now and</text>
  <text start="520.34" dur="8.16">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all of</text>
  <text start="522.75" dur="8.7">this is that people around the world</text>
  <text start="528.5" dur="4.21">they&amp;#39;re starting to wake up a little bit</text>
  <text start="531.45" dur="4.83">because they&amp;#39;re starting to realize</text>
  <text start="532.71" dur="6.33">things don&amp;#39;t make sense they can&amp;#39;t put</text>
  <text start="536.28" dur="6.12">their finger on it but they&amp;#39;re realizing</text>
  <text start="539.04" dur="4.98">that something is wrong and out in</text>
  <text start="542.4" dur="3.86">Europe we see that investors they</text>
  <text start="544.02" dur="5.22">understand there&amp;#39;s major problems</text>
  <text start="546.26" dur="6.04">because we see that they are taking</text>
  <text start="549.24" dur="6.72">their cash taking it out of the European</text>
  <text start="552.3" dur="7.71">investments and shoving it into the</text>
  <text start="555.96" dur="6.21">emerging markets so they realize they</text>
  <text start="560.01" dur="5.01">need to place their funds someplace else</text>
  <text start="562.17" dur="3.39">actually he told me he went over to</text>
  <text start="565.02" dur="3.509">Singapore</text>
  <text start="565.56" dur="4.62">open up a bank account and he said it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="568.529" dur="3.571">very tough to open up a bank account in</text>
  <text start="570.18" dur="4.74">Singapore because you need a letter of</text>
  <text start="572.1" dur="6.12">recommendation before you can even open</text>
  <text start="574.92" dur="6.57">up an account in Singapore and he says</text>
  <text start="578.22" dur="7.44">they are very strict with holding your</text>
  <text start="581.49" dur="7.95">funds it&amp;#39;s very secure out in Singapore</text>
  <text start="585.66" dur="6.15">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="589.44" dur="4.14">many people are taking their funds their</text>
  <text start="591.81" dur="4.02">gold or silver whatever they have and</text>
  <text start="593.58" dur="6.06">moving it outside of the United States</text>
  <text start="595.83" dur="7.64">moving it outside of Europe now what</text>
  <text start="599.64" dur="6.99">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that people are fleeing</text>
  <text start="603.47" dur="5.83">people are realizing that things are</text>
  <text start="606.63" dur="5.22">going to accelerate we&amp;#39;re already seeing</text>
  <text start="609.3" dur="4.56">it we see that around the world we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="611.85" dur="4.14">zero percent interest rates many places</text>
  <text start="613.86" dur="3.6">are a negative we know the United States</text>
  <text start="615.99" dur="4.89">will be heading into that negative</text>
  <text start="617.46" dur="6.84">region and something very interesting</text>
  <text start="620.88" dur="7.38">came up from JP Morgan&amp;#39;s former perma</text>
  <text start="624.3" dur="6.48">Bowl Tommy let Tom Lee and he said</text>
  <text start="628.26" dur="4.829">something where it should scare everyone</text>
  <text start="630.78" dur="4.62">at this point and I&amp;#39;m not in the</text>
  <text start="633.089" dur="4.651">business you know of scaring you I just</text>
  <text start="635.4" dur="5.16">like to have you informed I want you to</text>
  <text start="637.74" dur="4.62">be prepared I don&amp;#39;t want you to be you</text>
  <text start="640.56" dur="6.27">know surprised when everything falls</text>
  <text start="642.36" dur="7.31">apart and he said for whatever reason we</text>
  <text start="646.83" dur="6.63">are scared about the month of august</text>
  <text start="649.67" dur="8.94">four of the six most recent August have</text>
  <text start="653.46" dur="8.06">been big down months and this August</text>
  <text start="658.61" dur="6.96">doesn&amp;#39;t look any better and we&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="661.52" dur="8.17">nervous and what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is</text>
  <text start="665.57" dur="7.51">that people realize that the market is</text>
  <text start="669.69" dur="7.56">completely manipulated that the economy</text>
  <text start="673.08" dur="9.24">is completely manipulated that when this</text>
  <text start="677.25" dur="6.839">economy comes down and crashes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="682.32" dur="3.99">going to happen in a split second it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="684.089" dur="5.311">funny the person I was speaking to from</text>
  <text start="686.31" dur="6.96">his years of experience he said this</text>
  <text start="689.4" dur="5.13">will happen very very quickly and I</text>
  <text start="693.27" dur="3.3">agree with him I don&amp;#39;t think this is</text>
  <text start="694.53" dur="4.5">going to be a long drawn-out period I</text>
  <text start="696.57" dur="2.88">think when they are prepared and ready</text>
  <text start="699.03" dur="4.02">to bring</text>
  <text start="699.45" dur="8.25">the system down it will be a snap of the</text>
  <text start="703.05" dur="8.04">finger because what we see in 1929 boom</text>
  <text start="707.7" dur="5.79">it just happened what we saw in 2001</text>
  <text start="711.09" dur="6.3">boom it just happened what we saw in</text>
  <text start="713.49" dur="6.9">2008 boom it just happened we are on the</text>
  <text start="717.39" dur="8.43">same course the only difference right</text>
  <text start="720.39" dur="8.55">now is that things are much worse the</text>
  <text start="725.82" dur="5.73">people are not driving the economy the</text>
  <text start="728.94" dur="5.25">people are not driving the stock market</text>
  <text start="731.55" dur="4.53">this whole thing was created by the</text>
  <text start="734.19" dur="4.17">central bank the bubbles were created by</text>
  <text start="736.08" dur="4.85">the central bank and when this comes</text>
  <text start="738.36" dur="6.96">down we&amp;#39;ve already had the instance of</text>
  <text start="740.93" dur="6.37">everyone losing their wealth during 2008</text>
  <text start="745.32" dur="4.83">many people the majority of the country</text>
  <text start="747.3" dur="5.55">has never recovered from that yes</text>
  <text start="750.15" dur="6.72">they&amp;#39;re getting by but they&amp;#39;ve never</text>
