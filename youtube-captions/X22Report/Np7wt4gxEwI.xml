  <text start="46.89" dur="4.11">many different economic indicators and</text>
  <text start="48.809" dur="4.111">we come to realize that the United</text>

  <text start="52.92" dur="3.99">the help of corporations they have the</text>
  <text start="55.17" dur="3.389">ability to create these incredible</text>
  <text start="56.91" dur="5.219">bubbles in the housing market in the</text>
  <text start="58.559" dur="6.511">auto industry in the student loan market</text>
  <text start="62.129" dur="5.251">and many other areas and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="65.07" dur="4.74">seeing is they use these bubbles to</text>
  <text start="67.38" dur="4.29">convince the world and the people here</text>
  <text start="69.81" dur="3.36">in the United States that everything is</text>
  <text start="71.67" dur="3.75">fine the economy is doing well and</text>
  <text start="73.17" dur="4.47">everything&amp;#39;s great now they keep pushing</text>
  <text start="75.42" dur="4.68">the idea that the auto industry is doing</text>
  <text start="77.64" dur="4.83">absolutely fantastically well and they</text>
  <text start="80.1" dur="4.909">keep saying that yes this year auto</text>
  <text start="82.47" dur="4.649">sales are going to be incredibly well</text>
  <text start="85.009" dur="3.791">everything&amp;#39;s going to be fantastic now</text>
  <text start="87.119" dur="4.201">remember they brought in a lot of</text>
  <text start="88.8" dur="4.5">subprime people to take out loans</text>
  <text start="91.32" dur="5.189">remember every time someone purchases a</text>
  <text start="93.3" dur="4.92">car they&amp;#39;re getting loans they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="96.509" dur="4.981">using their own money most of the time</text>
  <text start="98.22" dur="5.129">you to put zero percent down and you can</text>
  <text start="101.49" dur="3.359">walk off a lot with a card and then we</text>
  <text start="103.349" dur="3.811">see delinquencies and everything else</text>
  <text start="104.849" dur="4.97">and the cars we possessed but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="107.16" dur="5.549">very interesting is that sales of</text>
  <text start="109.819" dur="5.92">automobiles is declining right now</text>
  <text start="112.709" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re not that hot and coming from the</text>
  <text start="115.739" dur="3.69">factories what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that they</text>
  <text start="117.959" dur="4.11">need to cancel the second and third</text>
  <text start="119.429" dur="4.411">quarter schedules overtime and what that</text>
  <text start="122.069" dur="4.89">means and what that tells us is that</text>
  <text start="123.84" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re not producing as many cars as</text>
  <text start="126.959" dur="4.831">everyone thinks and they&amp;#39;re not selling</text>
  <text start="128.94" dur="5.909">as many cars as everyone thinks actually</text>
  <text start="131.79" dur="5.01">GM and Ford they have canceled their</text>
  <text start="134.849" dur="4.11">scheduled overtime shifts and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="136.8" dur="4.56">very interesting about automobile sales</text>
  <text start="138.959" dur="4.621">is that everyone thinks that oh you go</text>
  <text start="141.36" dur="6.09">into a dealer you buy a car they count</text>
  <text start="143.58" dur="6.93">it as a sale no that&amp;#39;s not how they</text>
  <text start="147.45" dur="6.75">count this what they&amp;#39;ve done is they</text>
  <text start="150.51" dur="8.789">switch things up and the way they record</text>
  <text start="154.2" dur="10.03">sales when any car or truck is shipped</text>
  <text start="159.299" dur="8.681">to a dealer that is a sale</text>
  <text start="164.23" dur="6.06">so they can channel stuff dealers lots</text>
  <text start="167.98" dur="7.979">by providing them more and more cars and</text>
  <text start="170.29" dur="8.91">trucks those are counted as all sales so</text>
  <text start="175.959" dur="5.941">inventory piles up everyone thinks wow</text>
  <text start="179.2" dur="8.25">there&amp;#39;s a lot of sales out there but the</text>
  <text start="181.9" dur="7.949">whole thing is an illusion once again we</text>
  <text start="187.45" dur="6.209">find out that it&amp;#39;s completely an</text>
  <text start="189.849" dur="7.401">illusion now we see Russia and China</text>
  <text start="193.659" dur="6.66">they&amp;#39;re trying to deter eyes from the</text>
  <text start="197.25" dur="6.609">United States they don&amp;#39;t want their</text>
  <text start="200.319" dur="7.021">economy intertwined with the US economy</text>

  <text start="210.28" dur="4.44">big step here to D dollar eyes and</text>
  <text start="212.769" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re going to be killing the petro</text>
  <text start="214.72" dur="5.34">dollar and they&amp;#39;re going to be creating</text>
  <text start="216.549" dur="6.83">a rule based pricing of their domestic</text>

  <text start="232.959" dur="5.28">future market step by step what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="235.87" dur="5.01">seeing is Russia and China and other</text>
  <text start="238.239" dur="5.641">emerging economies they&amp;#39;re taking steps</text>
  <text start="240.88" dur="5.82">to reduce their dependency on the US</text>
  <text start="243.88" dur="6.03">dollar now why are they doing this they</text>
  <text start="246.7" dur="5.849">realize that the economy&amp;#39;s the economy</text>
  <text start="249.91" dur="5.189">of the United States is rapidly</text>
  <text start="252.549" dur="4.771">deteriorating the dollar is at its end</text>
  <text start="255.099" dur="5.461">game and they&amp;#39;re getting prepared and</text>
  <text start="257.32" dur="7.11">ready for a new economic system and this</text>
  <text start="260.56" dur="6.24">is why the u.s. is out there pushing and</text>
  <text start="264.43" dur="4.609">provoking these countries into war</text>
  <text start="266.8" dur="4.83">because they don&amp;#39;t want to give this up</text>
  <text start="269.039" dur="5.111">the wealthy of the elite they make a lot</text>
  <text start="271.63" dur="4.95">of money off of this it doesn&amp;#39;t help the</text>
  <text start="274.15" dur="4.59">people of the United States it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="276.58" dur="5.64">help the people throughout Europe it</text>
  <text start="278.74" dur="5.22">doesn&amp;#39;t help the people anywhere because</text>
  <text start="282.22" dur="5.759">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that this</text>
  <text start="283.96" dur="6.929">system was completely designed to build</text>
  <text start="287.979" dur="6.031">up debt steal the wealth from the people</text>
  <text start="290.889" dur="6.361">steal the wealth from countries and turn</text>
  <text start="294.01" dur="4.159">this worthless paper and ink into real</text>
  <text start="297.25" dur="4.969">hard-ass</text>
  <text start="298.169" dur="6.601">and this is what central bankers do now</text>
  <text start="302.219" dur="4.651">we talk a lot about the government and</text>
  <text start="304.77" dur="4.59">all the different agencies spying on the</text>
  <text start="306.87" dur="4.349">American people and we know what they</text>
  <text start="309.36" dur="5.97">like to do is they like to go to the</text>
  <text start="311.219" dur="6.06">young generation and brainwash these</text>
  <text start="315.33" dur="4.169">individuals into thinking that this is</text>
  <text start="317.279" dur="4.531">the new normal just like they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="319.499" dur="5.521">common core to convince them that this</text>
  <text start="321.81" dur="5.729">is how history actually happened rights</text>
  <text start="325.02" dur="6.06">are not yours to keep their privileges</text>
  <text start="327.539" dur="6.391">they&amp;#39;re rewriting some of the amendments</text>
  <text start="331.08" dur="8.309">and they&amp;#39;re getting our youth very used</text>
  <text start="333.93" dur="7.829">to accepting spying getting very used to</text>
  <text start="339.389" dur="6.33">handing over all their information like</text>
  <text start="341.759" dur="6.81">fingerprints I scans DNA they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="345.719" dur="6.841">them used to having them searched at any</text>
  <text start="348.569" dur="6.421">time the police or government officials</text>
  <text start="352.56" dur="4.02">want to search them and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="354.99" dur="4.32">that they&amp;#39;re bringing this down to the</text>
  <text start="356.58" dur="5.699">school level and they&amp;#39;re introducing</text>
  <text start="359.31" dur="4.979">biometric scanners in schools now</text>
  <text start="362.279" dur="3.901">they&amp;#39;re going to start off using this in</text>
  <text start="364.289" dur="3.99">the lunch rooms because they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="366.18" dur="5.579">the students they don&amp;#39;t have the ability</text>
  <text start="368.279" dur="4.95">to carry around a card to purchase lunch</text>
  <text start="371.759" dur="3">so what we&amp;#39;re going to do is we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="373.229" dur="4.141">to set up this biometric identification</text>
  <text start="374.759" dur="5.28">system which will then scan everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="377.37" dur="4.469">fingerprint and it will allow them to</text>
  <text start="380.039" dur="5.31">purchase their lunches will make it a</text>
  <text start="381.839" dur="7.26">lot easier and it&amp;#39;ll be very nice to</text>
  <text start="385.349" dur="6.93">have their fingerprints on record we see</text>
  <text start="389.099" dur="4.65">in Illinois the Geneva unit district 304</text>
  <text start="392.279" dur="3.331">they have recently installed the</text>
  <text start="393.749" dur="4.711">biometric scanners and their cafeterias</text>
  <text start="395.61" dur="5.01">and each student will be going ahead and</text>
  <text start="398.46" dur="4.109">placing their finger on this and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="400.62" dur="3.779">be recorded now they&amp;#39;re going to be able</text>
  <text start="402.569" dur="5.25">to use this information to track the</text>
  <text start="404.399" dur="5.911">students it&amp;#39;ll be personal to them and</text>
  <text start="407.819" dur="5.52">then it will be distributed to other</text>
  <text start="410.31" dur="5.909">agencies so we can see already they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="413.339" dur="5.61">starting at a very young age to follow</text>
  <text start="416.219" dur="5.1">the youth around and get them used to</text>
  <text start="418.949" dur="4.291">giving up their biometric data because</text>
  <text start="421.319" dur="5.07">we see this coming right now we know</text>
  <text start="423.24" dur="4.62">what the real IDs where the d8 where DHS</text>
  <text start="426.389" dur="3.39">wants all the states to come in</text>
  <text start="427.86" dur="3.66">compliance where they can collect your</text>
  <text start="429.779" dur="4.021">facial scan</text>
  <text start="431.52" dur="5.07">they can collect your retinal scans they</text>
  <text start="433.8" dur="4.56">can collect your DNA your fingerprints</text>
  <text start="436.59" dur="4.259">they&amp;#39;re going to put a barcode and or</text>
  <text start="438.36" dur="4.709">fighting trip and the real in the real</text>
  <text start="440.849" dur="4.081">IDs and all this is going to be</text>
  <text start="443.069" dur="3.63">correlated up to a single database and</text>
  <text start="444.93" dur="3.78">this is to track everyone and what they</text>
  <text start="446.699" dur="5.161">normally do is they start off with the</text>
  <text start="448.71" dur="5.459">young they get them indoctrinated used</text>
  <text start="451.86" dur="4.83">to this and they make them feel like</text>
  <text start="454.169" dur="5.12">this is normal and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="456.69" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re doing we see the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="459.289" dur="5.28">continually provoking Russia what</text>

  <text start="520.05" dur="4.5">their ground force in Yemen now the</text>
  <text start="521.82" dur="5.009">Yemeni people they&amp;#39;re completely against</text>
  <text start="524.55" dur="4.11">the US troops being deployed in their</text>
  <text start="526.829" dur="4.921">country and we&amp;#39;re seeing this in Iraq</text>
  <text start="528.66" dur="5.82">we&amp;#39;re seeing it in Libya and we know</text>
  <text start="531.75" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s not welcomed in Syria but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="534.48" dur="3.03">starting to see all these countries</text>
  <text start="535.44" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re starting to push back and say</text>
  <text start="537.51" dur="5.04">you know something we don&amp;#39;t want this</text>

  <text start="567.349" dur="4.97">Sea and nor the fleets in the</text>
  <text start="569.209" dur="6.39">Mediterranean at this point so it seems</text>
  <text start="572.319" dur="5.71">that they think that something is going</text>
  <text start="575.599" dur="4.98">to occur in this area and they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="590.149" dur="4.11">Eastern section this is why we see</text>
  <text start="592.099" dur="4.23">additional warships coming in this is</text>
  <text start="594.259" dur="5.01">why the US has warships off the coast of</text>
  <text start="596.329" dur="6.96">Libya this is why we see the coalition</text>
  <text start="599.269" dur="5.85">forces that were using ships close to</text>
  <text start="603.289" dur="4.05">the Mediterranean to say that oh they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="636.859" dur="3.39">medical personnel no I don&amp;#39;t know why we</text>
  <text start="638.689" dur="3.86">need this because one was it okay to</text>
  <text start="640.249" dur="4.98">attack medical personnel and facilities</text>
  <text start="642.549" dur="8.14">but they came up with this resolution to</text>
  <text start="645.229" dur="8.1">286 and now any country that does this</text>
  <text start="650.689" dur="4.56">will be charged with a war crime right</text>
  <text start="653.329" dur="5.22">now so 80 countries right now just</text>
  <text start="655.249" dur="5.61">slammed the US / continually bombing</text>
  <text start="658.549" dur="4.29">hospitals they&amp;#39;ve done this in</text>
  <text start="660.859" dur="4.83">Afghanistan they&amp;#39;ve done this in Yemen</text>
  <text start="662.839" dur="4.26">and they&amp;#39;ve done this in Syria and every</text>
  <text start="665.689" dur="4.11">time they turn around they say no wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="667.099" dur="4.41">us it wasn&amp;#39;t us and we see that yes it</text>
  <text start="669.799" dur="4.47">was the United States continually doing</text>
  <text start="671.509" dur="4.44">this and they&amp;#39;re continually doing this</text>
  <text start="674.269" dur="6.09">because what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="675.949" dur="8.07">trying to tell the people by hitting the</text>
  <text start="680.359" dur="6.99">infrastructure by hitting the civilians</text>
  <text start="684.019" dur="5.7">listen if you remove our puppet</text>
  <text start="687.349" dur="3.99">government you are going to pay the</text>
  <text start="689.719" dur="4.89">price and this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="691.339" dur="5.19">doing now we see the Russian forces they</text>
  <text start="694.609" dur="3.061">are setting up a new military base in</text>
  <text start="696.529" dur="2.551">Palmyra</text>
  <text start="697.67" dur="4.44">they brought in the pan crs-1</text>
  <text start="699.08" dur="5.31">anti-aircraft system it is deployed now</text>
  <text start="702.11" dur="6.21">in this area and we can see that Russia</text>
  <text start="704.39" dur="8.16">is trying to control the entire area</text>
  <text start="708.32" dur="6.66">push back the terrorists and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="712.55" dur="5.43">continually winning the battles in all</text>
  <text start="714.98" dur="5.61">these areas and this is why the US wants</text>
  <text start="717.98" dur="4.74">peace this is why the US wants a</text>
  <text start="720.59" dur="4.89">ceasefire it looks like the ceasefire</text>
  <text start="722.72" dur="7.29">has extended now for 72 hours in Aleppo</text>
  <text start="725.48" dur="8.4">and Senator Richard black US state</text>
  <text start="730.01" dur="5.76">senator from Virginia he claims and I</text>
  <text start="733.88" dur="6.54">completely agree with him on this that</text>
  <text start="735.77" dur="6.45">the US government has likely prevented</text>
  <text start="740.42" dur="4.14">the Syrian government&amp;#39;s armed forces</text>
  <text start="742.22" dur="4.68">from recapturing the city of Aleppo from</text>
  <text start="744.56" dur="4.41">al Qaeda and al-nusrah and this is</text>
  <text start="746.9" dur="4.71">exactly what they&amp;#39;ve done it&amp;#39;s a stall</text>
  <text start="748.97" dur="5.1">tactic and he said it is clear to me</text>
  <text start="751.61" dur="4.53">that what is happening is we are trying</text>
  <text start="754.07" dur="4.02">to desperately slow down the Syrian army</text>
  <text start="756.14" dur="5.31">advanced which is on the verge of</text>
  <text start="758.09" dur="6.9">crushing al-nusrah and al-qaeda in</text>
  <text start="761.45" dur="6.93">Aleppo and this is a strategic location</text>
  <text start="764.99" dur="5.7">and the u.s. cannot let this happen and</text>
  <text start="768.38" dur="4.47">this is why they were pushing for a</text>
  <text start="770.69" dur="5.97">ceasefire and they want it extended</text>
  <text start="772.85" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re buying their time black further</text>
  <text start="776.66" dur="3.36">allege that Geneva peace talks are being</text>
  <text start="778.52" dur="5.27">carried out with a goal of preserving</text>
  <text start="780.02" dur="7.77">the anti-assad terrorist organizations</text>
  <text start="783.79" dur="7.66">absolutely so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="787.79" dur="6.45">now is the u.s. is using the ceasefire</text>
  <text start="791.45" dur="5.76">the peace talks as a stall tactic</text>
  <text start="794.24" dur="6.57">because their main goal is to try to</text>
  <text start="797.21" dur="6.9">hold their positions in Syria bring in</text>
  <text start="800.81" dur="5.88">more troops set up the air bases so they</text>
  <text start="804.11" dur="5.82">can have this major offensive coming up</text>
  <text start="806.69" dur="6">in august now we see all over the</text>
  <text start="809.93" dur="6.12">corporate media that they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="812.69" dur="5.7">this bombing of this refugee camp is a</text>
  <text start="816.05" dur="5.01">war crime and they want the UN to</text>
  <text start="818.39" dur="5.25">investigate this now again they have</text>
  <text start="821.06" dur="4.26">absolutely no proof that Russia or Syria</text>
  <text start="823.64" dur="4.38">did this but using the propaganda saying</text>
  <text start="825.32" dur="4.74">that Oh most likely it probably was</text>
  <text start="828.02" dur="3.01">Russia or Syria now Russia and Syria</text>
  <text start="830.06" dur="3.48">they didn&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="831.03" dur="5.7">warplanes in the area whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="833.54" dur="4.78">when you look at the video and you look</text>
  <text start="836.73" dur="4.92">at the pictures of this area you see no</text>
  <text start="838.32" dur="6.99">craters whatsoever this was contained in</text>
  <text start="841.65" dur="6.18">a very small area and it looks like it</text>
  <text start="845.31" dur="4.59">was a fire it doesn&amp;#39;t even look like it</text>
  <text start="847.83" dur="4.29">was bombed actually it looks like it was</text>
  <text start="849.9" dur="4.26">a fire and they move things around so to</text>
  <text start="852.12" dur="4.47">me it&amp;#39;s starting to look like a setup</text>
  <text start="854.16" dur="4.89">and of course the location of the</text>
  <text start="856.59" dur="6.15">refugee refugee camp is right on the</text>
  <text start="859.05" dur="5.76">border of Turkey now what are they using</text>
  <text start="862.74" dur="5.91">this for well of course a demon eyes</text>
  <text start="864.81" dur="5.25">Assad to demonize Russia all they have</text>
  <text start="868.65" dur="4.17">to do is mention war crime people</text>
  <text start="870.06" dur="4.95">already in their minds think oh it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="872.82" dur="4.25">war crime who did it now of course the</text>
  <text start="875.01" dur="5.43">u.s. can&amp;#39;t present any proof whatsoever</text>
  <text start="877.07" dur="4.9">they have none but they just have to</text>
  <text start="880.44" dur="3.48">mention it this is how the propaganda</text>
  <text start="881.97" dur="4.89">works and it looks like what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="883.92" dur="5.46">trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying to say</text>
  <text start="886.86" dur="5.61">okay Assad in Russia look how evil they</text>
  <text start="889.38" dur="5.34">are we need to protect these people in</text>
  <text start="892.47" dur="5.22">these areas and maybe we should you know</text>
  <text start="894.72" dur="5.79">set up some type of zone in these area</text>
  <text start="897.69" dur="5.04">to protect the refugees the civilians in</text>
  <text start="900.51" dur="6.36">these areas and we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="902.73" dur="5.61">this is a complete setup and this is</text>
  <text start="906.87" dur="3.24">what they really wanted from the</text>
  <text start="908.34" dur="4.17">beginning I know Obama the corporate</text>
  <text start="910.11" dur="4.02">media is out there saying we do not you</text>
  <text start="912.51" dur="4.38">know it&amp;#39;s not right to have a safe zone</text>
  <text start="914.13" dur="5.46">we don&amp;#39;t agree with Turkey it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="916.89" dur="7.05">the opposite if you notice they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="919.59" dur="7.29">building everything up in northern Syria</text>
  <text start="923.94" dur="5.34">having the air bases the troops these</text>
  <text start="926.88" dur="4.17">events that try to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="929.28" dur="5.34">that this is something so they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="931.05" dur="6.03">building out a safe zone area they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="934.62" dur="5.13">bringing in military assets they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="937.08" dur="5.34">extending the runways in two bases in</text>
  <text start="939.75" dur="6.57">northern Syria they&amp;#39;re bringing in more</text>
  <text start="942.42" dur="7.92">and more troops all of this is in</text>
  <text start="946.32" dur="5.34">preparation and we need to watch this</text>
  <text start="950.34" dur="3.93">very carefully because we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="951.66" dur="5.46">see the Middle East it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="954.27" dur="6.06">complete disaster in this area warships</text>
  <text start="957.12" dur="5.37">are on their way Russia&amp;#39;s bringing in</text>
  <text start="960.33" dur="4.6">more warships into metal into the</text>
  <text start="962.49" dur="5.19">Mediterranean because they realize</text>
  <text start="964.93" dur="6.87">that this is not going to end well and</text>
  <text start="967.68" dur="6.37">the u.s. they&amp;#39;re backed against the wall</text>
  <text start="971.8" dur="4.289">here they have no alternative than</text>
  <text start="974.05" dur="4.95">losing in Syria the losing control of</text>
  <text start="976.089" dur="5.821">Yemen the losing control of Lebanon the</text>
  <text start="979" dur="5.64">losing control of Libya and they have</text>
  <text start="981.91" dur="4.17">all the troops all the ships all the</text>
  <text start="984.64" dur="3.3">military assets from the coalition</text>
  <text start="986.08" dur="4.05">forces all built up in this area and</text>
  <text start="987.94" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re getting ready for this main</text>
  <text start="990.13" dur="6.98">event and this most likely will bring us</text>
  <text start="993.7" dur="6.389">into world war three unless Russia or</text>
  <text start="997.11" dur="4.12">something else occurs that stops it once</text>
  <text start="1000.089" dur="3.391">again but I think they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="1001.23" dur="4.169">going all out this time I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="1003.48" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re going to let another country</text>

  <text start="1009.36" dur="5.16">possibly can to get this war started</text>

  <text start="1018.93" dur="6.69">rising and the entire system is getting</text>
  <text start="1024.36" dur="3.839">ready to collapse and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1025.62" dur="5.1">this to collapse without them</text>
  <text start="1028.199" dur="5.071">controlling the collapse itself because</text>
  <text start="1030.72" dur="4.41">if it&amp;#39;s uncontrolled they will not be</text>
  <text start="1033.27" dur="4.23">able to blame another country or group</text>
