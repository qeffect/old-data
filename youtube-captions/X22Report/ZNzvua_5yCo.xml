  <text start="194.12" dur="7.32">when we look at the information we</text>
  <text start="196.01" dur="8.13">realize this is one gigantic lie we see</text>
  <text start="201.44" dur="8.66">auto sales well it looks like the bubble</text>

  <text start="222.05" dur="4.5">years</text>
  <text start="222.5" dur="5.76">remember how they count sales and this</text>
  <text start="226.55" dur="3.87">is becoming a problem now because there</text>
  <text start="228.26" dur="4.17">channel stuffing the Lots when the</text>
  <text start="230.42" dur="5.25">manufacturer delivers the car to the lot</text>
  <text start="232.43" dur="8">that is a sale it&amp;#39;s not when they make</text>
  <text start="235.67" dur="7.77">the sale to a consumer so sales are</text>
  <text start="240.43" dur="5.23">collapsing because the people are not</text>
  <text start="243.44" dur="4.65">taking cars off the lot there is no room</text>
  <text start="245.66" dur="4.38">on the lot and the manufacturer</text>
  <text start="248.09" dur="4.47">continually wants to bring more cars</text>
  <text start="250.04" dur="5.61">onto the lot and the inventories are</text>
  <text start="252.56" dur="7.2">growing and we haven&amp;#39;t seen anything</text>
  <text start="255.65" dur="7.41">like this since 2008 and we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="259.76" dur="6.659">to realize that the consumer demand for</text>
  <text start="263.06" dur="6.78">automobiles it&amp;#39;s dropping GM their sales</text>

  <text start="285.8" dur="3.66">now they&amp;#39;re blaming this on everything</text>
  <text start="287.57" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re blaming it on the weather</text>
  <text start="289.46" dur="6.81">they&amp;#39;re blaming it on the shortened</text>
  <text start="292.46" dur="5.02">months they&amp;#39;re blaming it on a cloudy</text>
  <text start="296.27" dur="5.26">day</text>
  <text start="297.48" dur="6.69">blaming everything except what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="301.53" dur="7.11">going on here and that is the American</text>
  <text start="304.17" dur="6.6">person is tapped out remember in real</text>
  <text start="308.64" dur="5.1">estate when they told us that new</text>
  <text start="310.77" dur="4.17">construction it is surging right now</text>
  <text start="313.74" dur="4.2">well that&amp;#39;s very odd because</text>
  <text start="314.94" dur="6.21">construction is construction spending is</text>
  <text start="317.94" dur="5.13">going the opposite way us construction</text>
  <text start="321.15" dur="6.57">spending that plunged by 1.8 percent in</text>
  <text start="323.07" dur="7.11">April and they expected a 0.6 percent</text>
  <text start="327.72" dur="5.01">rise they were completely off this is</text>
  <text start="330.18" dur="5.42">the biggest monthly drop since January</text>

  <text start="344.9" dur="4.03">residential construction down by one</text>
  <text start="347.55" dur="5.58">point five percent this is the weakest</text>
  <text start="348.93" dur="9.71">since April of 2009 so what are we</text>
  <text start="353.13" dur="9.96">seeing here we are seeing everything</text>
  <text start="358.64" dur="5.65">declining we see an implosion happening</text>
  <text start="363.09" dur="4.65">right in front of our eyes and this is</text>
  <text start="364.29" dur="7.86">continuing manufacturing dead in the</text>
  <text start="367.74" dur="8.96">water US manufacturing PMI slipped to 50</text>
  <text start="372.15" dur="8.79">point seven it is the weakest September</text>
  <text start="376.7" dur="8.05">2009 and you know we were in the Great</text>
  <text start="380.94" dur="6.87">Recession at that point market not the</text>
  <text start="384.75" dur="4.98">stock market but market the company for</text>
  <text start="387.81" dur="4.08">those looking for a rebound in the</text>
  <text start="389.73" dur="2.76">economy after the lackluster start to</text>
  <text start="391.89" dur="4.23">this year</text>
  <text start="392.49" dur="7.71">well the trend in manufacturing is not</text>
  <text start="396.12" dur="7.2">going to provide any comfort and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="400.2" dur="4.65">happening right now are is that things</text>
  <text start="403.32" dur="4.74">are really starting to rapidly fall</text>
  <text start="404.85" dur="6.03">apart and this is why the US government</text>
  <text start="408.06" dur="4.23">central bankers are working so hard I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="410.88" dur="5.67">sure they&amp;#39;re paying themselves over time</text>
  <text start="412.29" dur="6.48">to do this to feed us the illusion the</text>
  <text start="416.55" dur="3.33">propaganda that the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="418.77" dur="3.21">well they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="419.88" dur="5.22">possibly can to keep that market up to</text>
  <text start="421.98" dur="3.99">keep gold and silver down to manipulate</text>
  <text start="425.1" dur="3.09">the numbers they can manipulate</text>
  <text start="425.97" dur="5.07">manipulate the bubbles where they can</text>
  <text start="428.19" dur="4.86">but when we look at all this information</text>
  <text start="431.04" dur="5.91">it is really starting to fall apart the</text>
  <text start="433.05" dur="6.93">Baltic Troy index is now stable at 612</text>
  <text start="436.95" dur="4.98">it has not moved we see Bank of America</text>

  <text start="441.93" dur="7.68">week in a row they have been selling</text>
  <text start="446.18" dur="7.21">getting out of the market this is the</text>
  <text start="449.61" dur="8.28">longest uninterrupted selling streak in</text>
  <text start="453.39" dur="7.86">their data since 2008 it tells you</text>
  <text start="457.89" dur="6.3">something that people are realizing what</text>
  <text start="461.25" dur="6.54">is going on they need to get out of the</text>
  <text start="464.19" dur="5.97">market and the Fed is creating more</text>
  <text start="467.79" dur="4.5">money handing it over to the banks</text>
  <text start="470.16" dur="6.47">giving it to the plunger production team</text>
  <text start="472.29" dur="8.01">to keep this market up as best they can</text>
  <text start="476.63" dur="7.84">we see that there are countries and</text>
  <text start="480.3" dur="7.23">banks around the world that are taking</text>
  <text start="484.47" dur="6.69">their investments and diversifying them</text>
  <text start="487.53" dur="7.41">into gold we see the chief investment</text>

  <text start="507.75" dur="4.44">tenured German government bonds or</text>
  <text start="509.58" dur="5.399">Treasuries but as they don&amp;#39;t offer any</text>

  <text start="528.68" dur="4.69">we&amp;#39;re starting to notice that a lot of</text>
  <text start="531.45" dur="4.47">people are starting to move into this</text>
  <text start="533.37" dur="5.91">this is why the US government central</text>
  <text start="535.92" dur="5.97">bankers are continually suppressing gold</text>
  <text start="539.28" dur="5.28">and silver we see Russia and Saudi</text>
  <text start="541.89" dur="7.67">Arabia they have dumped about 50 billion</text>
  <text start="544.56" dur="7.35">in US assets between 2014 and 2015 and</text>
  <text start="549.56" dur="6.37">Saudi Arabia they reduced their holdings</text>
  <text start="551.91" dur="6.33">by 26 billion dollars this is according</text>
  <text start="555.93" dur="4.92">to the annual US Treasury survey which</text>
  <text start="558.24" dur="5.4">was published this week and something</text>
  <text start="560.85" dur="4.049">very interesting is that Russia since</text>
  <text start="563.64" dur="4.97">2008</text>
  <text start="564.899" dur="6.99">cut their us Holdings in half and</text>
  <text start="568.61" dur="6.31">they&amp;#39;re continually dumping removing and</text>
  <text start="571.889" dur="6.69">moving further and further away from the</text>
  <text start="574.92" dur="6">dollar-based securities China is doing</text>
  <text start="578.579" dur="6.391">the same and many countries are</text>
  <text start="580.92" dur="6.659">following now we talked about the</text>
  <text start="584.97" dur="5.13">economic collapse quite a bit we talked</text>
  <text start="587.579" dur="6.36">about preparing getting food getting</text>
  <text start="590.1" dur="6.81">supplies getting medical supplies and we</text>
  <text start="593.939" dur="6.51">really need to look at Venezuela and we</text>
  <text start="596.91" dur="5.13">need to understand that this is going to</text>
  <text start="600.449" dur="3.63">come to the United States now I know a</text>
  <text start="602.04" dur="3.899">lot of people are out there saying no</text>
  <text start="604.079" dur="6">this is completely impossible it will</text>
  <text start="605.939" dur="7.231">never happen here but if you were alive</text>
  <text start="610.079" dur="6.211">back in the 70s you remember when we</text>
  <text start="613.17" dur="5.609">were moving from the gold standards the</text>
  <text start="616.29" dur="6.06">petrodollar standard where there was no</text>
  <text start="618.779" dur="6.831">fuel you had to go on odd or even days</text>
  <text start="622.35" dur="5.76">there was a red flag or green flag and</text>
  <text start="625.61" dur="5.289">it was very tough actually it was very</text>
  <text start="628.11" dur="4.62">tough getting a job things were not</text>
  <text start="630.899" dur="4.44">going well for a lot of people and this</text>
  <text start="632.73" dur="5.149">wasn&amp;#39;t even a collapse this was</text>
  <text start="635.339" dur="5.79">switching our monetary system to</text>
  <text start="637.879" dur="4.591">something different and when we look at</text>
  <text start="641.129" dur="4.05">Venezuela</text>
  <text start="642.47" dur="5.229">we can see that they&amp;#39;re going through a</text>
  <text start="645.179" dur="5.431">collapse so if we had that problem just</text>
  <text start="647.699" dur="5.791">switching think about the debt think</text>
  <text start="650.61" dur="4.409">about how the system is coming to an end</text>
  <text start="653.49" dur="8.089">think about all the countries that are</text>
  <text start="655.019" dur="8.91">moving away from the US based assets and</text>
  <text start="661.579" dur="6.161">during an economic collapse as we can</text>
  <text start="663.929" dur="6.26">see in Venezuela 85% of the companies in</text>
  <text start="667.74" dur="5.37">Venezuela they&amp;#39;ve halted production</text>
  <text start="670.189" dur="9.041">coca-cola they&amp;#39;ve shut down production</text>
  <text start="673.11" dur="8.729">too due to a shortage of sugar now if</text>
  <text start="679.23" dur="5.81">these people haven&amp;#39;t stored any food</text>
  <text start="681.839" dur="6.271">down there ahead of time guess what</text>
  <text start="685.04" dur="5.409">they&amp;#39;re gonna be out of luck because</text>
  <text start="688.11" dur="3.719">during this type of emergency and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="690.449" dur="5.041">heard this before where the credit</text>
  <text start="691.829" dur="6.541">market dries up deliveries dry up people</text>
  <text start="695.49" dur="3.35">can&amp;#39;t get supplies supplies are not</text>
  <text start="698.37" dur="3.08">being the</text>
  <text start="698.84" dur="5.19">two stores and this is a glimpse into</text>
  <text start="701.45" dur="4.68">the future of what is going to happen</text>
  <text start="704.03" dur="4.31">here I mean we&amp;#39;re gonna see people that</text>
  <text start="706.13" dur="4.59">are hungry people that are desperate and</text>
  <text start="708.34" dur="6.34">they&amp;#39;ll do just about anything to get</text>
  <text start="710.72" dur="7.11">these type of supplies and when the</text>
  <text start="714.68" dur="7.74">economy melts down and and collapses</text>
  <text start="717.83" dur="9.69">it&amp;#39;s not just food toiletries medical</text>
  <text start="722.42" dur="6.99">supplies all these type of things sure</text>
  <text start="727.52" dur="5.79">to just start to occur people start to</text>
  <text start="729.41" dur="7.08">barter people start to take these goods</text>
  <text start="733.31" dur="4.68">and sell them on the black market and if</text>
  <text start="736.49" dur="3.87">you need medical care during this type</text>
  <text start="737.99" dur="6.06">of economic meltdown well it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="740.36" dur="6.33">be very very difficult to do now</text>
  <text start="744.05" dur="5.31">yes precious metals will that help yes</text>
  <text start="746.69" dur="4.05">maybe later on will the currency help at</text>
  <text start="749.36" dur="4.16">that time well it&amp;#39;s going to lose value</text>
  <text start="750.74" dur="5.76">quite a bit what is going to help is</text>
  <text start="753.52" dur="6.34">having these supplies on hand because</text>
  <text start="756.5" dur="6.15">maybe you can barter them maybe you can</text>
  <text start="759.86" dur="4.74">help a friend out or you can use them</text>
