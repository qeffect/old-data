  <text start="124.06" dur="4.44">plan altogether was going to happen in a</text>
  <text start="125.71" dur="6.57">straight line you need to remove those</text>

  <text start="141.73" dur="4.86">road you can hit some curves there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="143.86" dur="4.95">gonna be ups and downs we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="146.59" dur="4.74">many many times before sometimes you</text>
  <text start="148.81" dur="5.67">need to go all the way around until you</text>
  <text start="151.33" dur="6.15">reach that goal it&amp;#39;s almost like losing</text>
  <text start="154.48" dur="4.29">weight you start off everything seems</text>
  <text start="157.48" dur="2.58">great you&amp;#39;re losing weight you&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="158.77" dur="3.12">weight you&amp;#39;re losing weight and then all</text>
  <text start="160.06" dur="4.71">of a sudden you plateau and you get</text>
  <text start="161.89" dur="6.84">upset oh look it&amp;#39;s not working anymore</text>
  <text start="164.77" dur="7.35">no changes have to be made adjustments</text>
  <text start="168.73" dur="5.85">and then you continually lose weight or</text>
  <text start="172.12" dur="3.69">if you&amp;#39;re negotiating a new car and</text>
  <text start="174.58" dur="4.53">you&amp;#39;re sitting there in the dealership</text>
  <text start="175.81" dur="5.49">with a car salesman you don&amp;#39;t walk in</text>
  <text start="179.11" dur="5.07">and say okay what do you got I&amp;#39;ll take</text>
  <text start="181.3" dur="4.62">it and that&amp;#39;s that if you do that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="184.18" dur="4.38">paying the highest price you didn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="185.92" dur="6.93">the best deal and it&amp;#39;s not in your</text>
  <text start="188.56" dur="6.66">favour now when you sit there and you</text>
  <text start="192.85" dur="4.56">say okay listen I want this free I want</text>
  <text start="195.22" dur="4.86">this I want this price down here I want</text>
  <text start="197.41" dur="6.54">this interest rate this takes some time</text>
  <text start="200.08" dur="6.96">because you&amp;#39;re negotiating for yourself</text>
  <text start="203.95" dur="5.7">you&amp;#39;re negotiating to benefit yourself</text>
  <text start="207.04" dur="4.71">now the sales manager the salesman</text>
  <text start="209.65" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re negotiating to benefit</text>
  <text start="211.75" dur="5.73">themselves and they&amp;#39;re going to fight</text>
  <text start="214.96" dur="4.62">back and I don&amp;#39;t mean physically fight</text>
  <text start="217.48" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re going to counter everything that</text>
  <text start="219.58" dur="5.46">you do until you reach a middle point</text>
  <text start="222.04" dur="7.2">and sometimes you have to get up and say</text>
  <text start="225.04" dur="6.45">I can&amp;#39;t accept this deal and see if they</text>
  <text start="229.24" dur="5.22">will fold this is what Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="231.49" dur="6.12">right now this economic plan the entire</text>
  <text start="234.46" dur="7.89">plan does not happen in a straight line</text>
  <text start="237.61" dur="9.42">and sometimes you have to show countries</text>
  <text start="242.35" dur="6.99">salesmen individuals that listen I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="247.03" dur="6.63">have to go along with this I can get up</text>
  <text start="249.34" dur="7.68">and leave I can place tariffs on you it</text>
  <text start="253.66" dur="5.76">makes no difference to me once you have</text>
  <text start="257.02" dur="4.529">that mindset that it doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="259.42" dur="5.31">matter and you&amp;#39;re not desperate and you</text>
  <text start="261.549" dur="6.571">can walk away at any time the other side</text>
  <text start="264.73" dur="6.03">becomes desperate now the salesman the</text>
  <text start="268.12" dur="5.7">manager they want the Commission they</text>
  <text start="270.76" dur="4.05">want a sale they desperately want it</text>
  <text start="273.82" dur="3.75">because they don&amp;#39;t know when the next</text>
  <text start="274.81" dur="5.09">customer is coming in so you have</text>
  <text start="277.57" dur="5.82">leverage Trump is doing the same thing</text>
  <text start="279.9" dur="5.95">he has leverage he has tariffs he can</text>
  <text start="283.39" dur="5.34">walk away he can say all right I&amp;#39;ll wait</text>
  <text start="285.85" dur="4.29">and it&amp;#39;s not going to happen in a</text>
  <text start="288.73" dur="2.28">straight line and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="290.14" dur="2.49">he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="291.01" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;ll be talking about that a little bit</text>
  <text start="292.63" dur="5.37">later in this report but first I wanted</text>
  <text start="295.24" dur="3.41">to head out to the UK because we are</text>
  <text start="298" dur="2.72">seeing</text>
  <text start="298.65" dur="4.92">exactly what we thought was going to</text>
  <text start="300.72" dur="5.22">happen now we know Boris Johnson now is</text>
  <text start="303.57" dur="4.05">the prime minister he&amp;#39;s promising</text>
  <text start="305.94" dur="3.36">there&amp;#39;s going to be a brexit come</text>
  <text start="307.62" dur="4.35">October we&amp;#39;re getting closer and closer</text>
  <text start="309.3" dur="3.57">to that deadline and as we get closer</text>
  <text start="311.97" dur="5.009">and closer</text>
  <text start="312.87" dur="10.23">we know that the EU they&amp;#39;re going to gin</text>
  <text start="316.979" dur="10.861">up the idea that the UK will not be safe</text>
  <text start="323.1" dur="8.16">and they&amp;#39;re going to push fear to try to</text>
  <text start="327.84" dur="7.98">make the country do what they want now</text>
  <text start="331.26" dur="7.89">the EU is not going to budge on their</text>
  <text start="335.82" dur="6.569">deal the UK is gonna say if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="339.15" dur="5.97">budge guess what it&amp;#39;s a No Deal so right</text>
  <text start="342.389" dur="5.851">now what the EU is doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="345.12" dur="8.34">they&amp;#39;re saying that if the UK exits the</text>
  <text start="348.24" dur="8.73">EU they will have increased money</text>
  <text start="353.46" dur="6.36">laundering especially to fund terrorist</text>
  <text start="356.97" dur="7.11">organizations they will not be able to</text>
  <text start="359.82" dur="10.59">track terrorists and they will not be</text>
  <text start="364.08" dur="10.32">able to use Europol the UK the country</text>
  <text start="370.41" dur="8.1">itself will not be able to stop certain</text>
  <text start="374.4" dur="7.259">events within their country they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="378.51" dur="5.49">using a fear tactic they&amp;#39;re saying if</text>
  <text start="381.659" dur="5.611">there&amp;#39;s a no deal scenario and you just</text>
  <text start="384" dur="7.02">leave the EU guess what the country is</text>
  <text start="387.27" dur="6.06">gonna have problems now once again are</text>
  <text start="391.02" dur="4.019">you trying to tell me the UK can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="393.33" dur="6.45">figure this out they can&amp;#39;t talk to other</text>
  <text start="395.039" dur="6.511">nations come on they&amp;#39;re using fear</text>
  <text start="399.78" dur="5.04">tactics just like they did with the</text>
  <text start="401.55" dur="5.85">referendum if you vote YES for the</text>
  <text start="404.82" dur="6.9">referendum the entire system is going to</text>
  <text start="407.4" dur="8.28">collapse the next day did it know the</text>
  <text start="411.72" dur="5.85">same thing with the brexit they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="415.68" dur="5.34">pushing fear and this is going to get</text>
  <text start="417.57" dur="6.75">worse and worse as we get closer to the</text>
  <text start="421.02" dur="5.19">month of October and we&amp;#39;ll have to watch</text>
  <text start="424.32" dur="5.31">and see how this all plays out and see</text>
  <text start="426.21" dur="5.87">what Boris Johnson does and how he</text>
  <text start="429.63" dur="5.31">maneuvers around all of the</text>
  <text start="432.08" dur="5.95">now the US Department of Agriculture on</text>

  <text start="450.03" dur="5.58">two largest economies broke out more</text>
  <text start="452.58" dur="5.82">than a year ago it was the first new</text>

  <text start="460.199" dur="5.25">was announced in late June and the first</text>
  <text start="463.139" dur="4.861">since Beijing offered to exempt five</text>
  <text start="465.449" dur="6.451">private crushers in the country from 25</text>
  <text start="468" dur="8.22">percent import tariffs and we can see</text>
  <text start="471.9" dur="7.47">that Trump the Patriots they are trying</text>
  <text start="476.22" dur="5.94">to make a deal with China they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="479.37" dur="4.71">going to give in just like with a car</text>
  <text start="482.16" dur="4.46">salesman and you&amp;#39;re trying to buy a car</text>
  <text start="484.08" dur="6.63">they&amp;#39;re going to use leverage and</text>
  <text start="486.62" dur="6.94">they&amp;#39;re going to stick to what benefits</text>
  <text start="490.71" dur="6.57">the United States Trump tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="493.56" dur="5.16">following our representatives have just</text>
  <text start="497.28" dur="4.02">returned from China where they had</text>
  <text start="498.72" dur="4.83">constructive talks having to do with a</text>
  <text start="501.3" dur="3.75">future trade deal we thought we had a</text>
  <text start="503.55" dur="3.96">deal with China three months ago but</text>
  <text start="505.05" dur="4.41">sadly China decided to renegotiate the</text>
  <text start="507.51" dur="3.719">deal prior to signing more recently</text>
  <text start="509.46" dur="3.569">trying trying to agreed to buy</text>
  <text start="511.229" dur="4.37">agricultural products from the US and</text>
  <text start="513.029" dur="6.69">large quantities but did not do so</text>
  <text start="515.599" dur="6.011">additionally my friend ji said that he</text>
  <text start="519.719" dur="3.87">would stop the sale of fentanyl to the</text>
  <text start="521.61" dur="4.68">United States this never happened and</text>
  <text start="523.589" dur="4.861">many Americans continue to die trade</text>
  <text start="526.29" dur="4.59">talks are continuing and during the</text>
  <text start="528.45" dur="6.03">talks the US will start on September 1st</text>
  <text start="530.88" dur="6.329">putting a small additional tariff of 10%</text>

  <text start="539.13" dur="5.1">into our country this does not include</text>
  <text start="541.68" dur="7.11">the 250 billion dollar already tariffs</text>
  <text start="544.23" dur="6.45">by 25% we look forward to continuing our</text>
  <text start="548.79" dur="4.049">positive dialogue with China on a</text>
  <text start="550.68" dur="3.57">comprehensive trade deal and feel that</text>
  <text start="552.839" dur="5.041">the future between our two countries</text>
  <text start="554.25" dur="5.64">will be a very bright one so China</text>
  <text start="557.88" dur="4.14">because Trump tweeted out the other day</text>
  <text start="559.89" dur="3.87">that they didn&amp;#39;t buy any agricultural</text>
  <text start="562.02" dur="2.94">products they decided to buy some soy</text>
  <text start="563.76" dur="3.48">beans</text>
  <text start="564.96" dur="4.02">and they didn&amp;#39;t buy the other things</text>
  <text start="567.24" dur="4.17">that they promised they also didn&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="568.98" dur="4.86">also didn&amp;#39;t stop the fentanyl sales here</text>
  <text start="571.41" dur="4.89">in the United States and this is why</text>
  <text start="573.84" dur="5.46">Trump is out there telling China and</text>
  <text start="576.3" dur="6.63">showing China that we mean business this</text>
  <text start="579.3" dur="5.85">is not what it used to be where we had</text>
  <text start="582.93" dur="4.2">certain deep state players in positions</text>
  <text start="585.15" dur="4.19">and they were just giving everything to</text>
  <text start="587.13" dur="6.18">China that&amp;#39;s not negotiations</text>
  <text start="589.34" dur="6.9">negotiations look like this listen we</text>
  <text start="593.31" dur="6">want this and if you don&amp;#39;t give it to us</text>
  <text start="596.24" dur="7.3">we have the leverage we can place</text>
  <text start="599.31" dur="7.62">tariffs we can wait what can you do can</text>
  <text start="603.54" dur="5.82">you wait do you like the tariffs well</text>
  <text start="606.93" dur="5.67">come to the negotiating table let&amp;#39;s work</text>
  <text start="609.36" dur="5.88">something out you need to give we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="612.6" dur="4.95">look at it and we&amp;#39;ll come to a meeting</text>
  <text start="615.24" dur="4.89">point in the center this is how</text>
  <text start="617.55" dur="4.41">negotiations work and it seems that</text>
  <text start="620.13" dur="4.56">China where they&amp;#39;re making these</text>
  <text start="621.96" dur="5.04">promises they haven&amp;#39;t really kept them</text>
  <text start="624.69" dur="4.83">and this is why Trump is saying listen</text>
  <text start="627" dur="6.39">you don&amp;#39;t believe me I&amp;#39;m gonna show you</text>
  <text start="629.52" dur="6.12">I will place additional tariffs on the</text>

  <text start="639.03" dur="5.49">the economy is the economy going to come</text>
  <text start="641.25" dur="5.07">down now remember all the financial</text>
  <text start="644.52" dur="4.08">opponents the economists they said this</text>
  <text start="646.32" dur="4.38">before well if Trump goes ahead and he</text>
  <text start="648.6" dur="3.96">places tariffs on China it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="650.7" dur="5.4">a complete and utter disaster and the</text>
  <text start="652.56" dur="6.06">economy statistically took off now yes</text>
  <text start="656.1" dur="5.28">we saw the market come down and why do</text>
  <text start="658.62" dur="8.7">you think Trump did this and announce</text>
  <text start="661.38" dur="8.75">this now right after the Fed cut rates</text>
  <text start="667.32" dur="5.58">the Fed cut rates by a quarter point</text>
  <text start="670.13" dur="5.38">Trump came out and announced more</text>
  <text start="672.9" dur="5.79">tariffs this has already built into the</text>

  <text start="678.69" dur="4.56">will all even out and the economy will</text>
  <text start="681.3" dur="4.35">start to move up again and I&amp;#39;m when I</text>
