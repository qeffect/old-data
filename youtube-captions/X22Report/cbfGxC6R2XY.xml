  <text start="228.6" dur="7.29">on a piece of paper now the EU is out</text>
  <text start="232.05" dur="10.35">there and it looks like they&amp;#39;re using a</text>
  <text start="235.89" dur="8.61">form of blackmail on Britain and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="242.4" dur="3.6">saying that Britain may face a surge in</text>
  <text start="244.5" dur="3.98">migration ahead of the country&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="254.33" dur="5.5">uncertainty over Britain&amp;#39;s looming exit</text>
  <text start="257.489" dur="4.5">from the EU will trigger a last-minute</text>
  <text start="259.83" dur="6.68">increase in EU citizens coming to the UK</text>
  <text start="261.989" dur="9.511">and this is going to result in delays</text>
  <text start="266.51" dur="7.54">backlogs in the immigration system now</text>
  <text start="271.5" dur="4.34">the UK is expected to institute a host</text>
  <text start="274.05" dur="4.08">of new freedom of movement restrictions</text>
  <text start="275.84" dur="6.1">following last ones vote to leave the</text>

  <text start="281.94" dur="5.19">yet to outline any of the details of</text>
  <text start="283.95" dur="5.31">this plan and again this referendum it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="287.13" dur="3.78">just an advisory referendum they</text>
  <text start="289.26" dur="4.59">actually haven&amp;#39;t taken the next steps</text>
  <text start="290.91" dur="5.43">yet but it looks like up until the point</text>
  <text start="293.85" dur="4.45">they do there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot of</text>
  <text start="296.34" dur="3.34">pressure on the UK</text>
  <text start="298.3" dur="5.25">stay and there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot of</text>
  <text start="299.68" dur="8.31">propaganda forcing them to stay in the</text>
  <text start="303.55" dur="7.29">EU nao Catalonia their Parliament have</text>
  <text start="307.99" dur="5.489">approved independence path where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="310.84" dur="6.12">going to say we want to break apart from</text>
  <text start="313.479" dur="6.09">Spain and we&amp;#39;re seeing they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="316.96" dur="5.549">down this track right now that they want</text>
  <text start="319.569" dur="5.401">independence so we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="322.509" dur="5.071">watch that situation very carefully we</text>
  <text start="324.97" dur="4.439">understand out in Germany there were two</text>
  <text start="327.58" dur="3.839">different false flag events one in</text>
  <text start="329.409" dur="4.711">France also we&amp;#39;re going to see this</text>
  <text start="331.419" dur="6.84">increase as time goes on and we knew</text>
  <text start="334.12" dur="8.519">part of the agenda here was for Germany</text>
  <text start="338.259" dur="7.38">to bring in more police military troops</text>
  <text start="342.639" dur="6.03">and have them guard different areas so</text>
  <text start="345.639" dur="5.131">right now Germany they will boost police</text>
  <text start="348.669" dur="6.271">presence at airports train stations and</text>
  <text start="350.77" dur="9.269">carry out stop and search operations</text>
  <text start="354.94" dur="8.94">close to border areas now residents are</text>
  <text start="360.039" dur="6.331">told to brace themselves for more act of</text>
  <text start="363.88" dur="5.689">terrorism which means more draconian</text>
  <text start="366.37" dur="5.94">laws which means more violations of the</text>
  <text start="369.569" dur="5.141">people&amp;#39;s rights and we&amp;#39;re seeing this</text>
  <text start="372.31" dur="4.05">happen in a lot of the European</text>
  <text start="374.71" dur="4.019">countries especially here in the United</text>
  <text start="376.36" dur="4.98">States Australia Canada and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="378.729" dur="4.351">going to continually do this because</text>
  <text start="381.34" dur="5.389">they understand what they understand</text>
  <text start="383.08" dur="6.839">what&amp;#39;s coming here a complete and total</text>
  <text start="386.729" dur="7.511">collapse of the system where they need</text>
  <text start="389.919" dur="9.421">to have everyone in fear that it was</text>
  <text start="394.24" dur="7.56">done from the outside and while they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="399.34" dur="5.22">doing this they&amp;#39;re hoping they can</text>
  <text start="401.8" dur="6.63">change a lot of the laws to control the</text>
  <text start="404.56" dur="6.21">people now in Ukraine we see Ukraine&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="408.43" dur="4.739">finance minister says there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="410.77" dur="6">the country needs to repay the three</text>
  <text start="413.169" dur="5.34">billion debt to Russia they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="416.77" dur="5.25">that it was a political credit which we</text>
  <text start="418.509" dur="6.481">were forced to take and right now we</text>
  <text start="422.02" dur="4.759">shouldn&amp;#39;t have to repay it of course</text>
  <text start="424.99" dur="5.489">Ukraine is trying to get out of this</text>
  <text start="426.779" dur="5.091">it&amp;#39;s funny when the central bankers look</text>
  <text start="430.479" dur="2.741">at other</text>
  <text start="431.87" dur="3">that from other countries them that are</text>
  <text start="433.22" dur="4.2">not part of their private west central</text>
  <text start="434.87" dur="5.1">bank system they say well we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="437.42" dur="4.26">to pay it but if a country whose part of</text>
  <text start="439.97" dur="4.11">the private western central bank system</text>
  <text start="441.68" dur="5.13">doesn&amp;#39;t want to pay the debt they say no</text>
  <text start="444.08" dur="4.88">that&amp;#39;s not possible so it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="446.81" dur="5.96">interesting the way they look at things</text>
  <text start="448.96" dur="6.37">Ukraine right now is receiving 72</text>
  <text start="452.77" dur="4.57">surveillance drones to Ukraine the u.s.</text>
  <text start="455.33" dur="3.75">is supplying these what are they going</text>
  <text start="457.34" dur="5.22">to be used for they&amp;#39;re going to transmit</text>
  <text start="459.08" dur="8.03">live video images location data to</text>
  <text start="462.56" dur="8.01">ground control stations so these systems</text>
  <text start="467.11" dur="6.79">which are they 24 RQ 11b raven unmanned</text>
  <text start="470.57" dur="6.9">aircraft they have arrived july twenty</text>
  <text start="473.9" dur="6.54">seventh and these systems can provide</text>
  <text start="477.47" dur="5.36">day or night aerial intelligence of</text>
  <text start="480.44" dur="5.94">course where they going to use them for</text>
  <text start="482.83" dur="6.19">to track and monitor the troops in the</text>
  <text start="486.38" dur="5.04">south east when they start the next</text>
  <text start="489.02" dur="6.27">offensive this is what this is all for</text>
  <text start="491.42" dur="6.18">now IRDA one is trying to introduce the</text>
  <text start="495.29" dur="5.28">death penalty he&amp;#39;s saying that the</text>
  <text start="497.6" dur="6.42">people want the death penalty and he</text>
  <text start="500.57" dur="5.46">slams the EU for inaction and he wants</text>
  <text start="504.02" dur="4.17">to do what the people want now do the</text>
  <text start="506.03" dur="3.93">people really want the death penalty are</text>
  <text start="508.19" dur="6.36">they really calling for this well we</text>
  <text start="509.96" dur="7.59">know that Erwin he lies quite a bit now</text>
  <text start="514.55" dur="6.54">very interestingly we know that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="517.55" dur="9.93">NATO they were behind the coup now the</text>
  <text start="521.09" dur="9.2">question is was her one with them or was</text>
  <text start="527.48" dur="5.61">the US and NATO trying to get rid of him</text>
  <text start="530.29" dur="4.87">because we see the individuals the</text>
  <text start="533.09" dur="5.18">members of the NATO&amp;#39;s rabid the pliable</text>
  <text start="535.16" dur="6.51">core they were part of this operation</text>
  <text start="538.27" dur="4.66">which shows that the United States had</text>
  <text start="541.67" dur="4.2">something to do with this even though</text>
  <text start="542.93" dur="6.5">Obama John Kerry all k mountains at no</text>
  <text start="545.87" dur="8.49">we had nothing to do with this coup so</text>
  <text start="549.43" dur="7.93">does Erna one really want Glenn or is he</text>
  <text start="554.36" dur="7.26">using this to justify moving away from</text>
  <text start="557.36" dur="8.04">the US so we&amp;#39;ve seen some indicators</text>
  <text start="561.62" dur="5.58">showing that maybe Turkey and Russia</text>
  <text start="565.4" dur="3.87">are becoming closer we know that Berta</text>
  <text start="567.2" dur="5.34">one is going to meet with Putin and at</text>
  <text start="569.27" dur="6.68">that point we&amp;#39;ll see if the Turkish</text>
  <text start="572.54" dur="8.69">stream pipeline is back on we&amp;#39;ll see if</text>
  <text start="575.95" dur="8.98">things start moving towards Russia but</text>
  <text start="581.23" dur="5.83">still when we look at this you have to</text>
  <text start="584.93" dur="4.49">wonder what is going on here because we</text>
  <text start="587.06" dur="5.34">see the entire system falling apart</text>
  <text start="589.42" dur="4.45">Russia and Syria are removing the</text>
  <text start="592.4" dur="4.41">Islamic state and we know that turkey</text>
  <text start="593.87" dur="5.43">supported them we know the US and the</text>
  <text start="596.81" dur="5.79">coalition forces this is their proxy</text>
  <text start="599.3" dur="6.66">army that&amp;#39;s long with turkey and right</text>
  <text start="602.6" dur="7.53">now they are losing ground in both Syria</text>
  <text start="605.96" dur="6.18">and Iraq now it seems that they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="610.13" dur="3.57">some type of clean-up operation because</text>
  <text start="612.14" dur="4.61">they know there is no hope for the</text>
  <text start="613.7" dur="5.82">Islamic state because we see already the</text>
  <text start="616.75" dur="6.7">United States is claiming that they have</text>
  <text start="619.52" dur="6.57">collected 10,000 items from the Islamic</text>
  <text start="623.45" dur="6.59">state it&amp;#39;s all Intel they&amp;#39;re sifting</text>
  <text start="626.09" dur="9.66">through it their thumb drives data files</text>
  <text start="630.04" dur="8.53">but the question is was this all done to</text>
  <text start="635.75" dur="6.45">start the cleanup of the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="638.57" dur="9.02">is this what Iran is doing in his</text>
  <text start="642.2" dur="8.19">country cleaning up this whole entire</text>
  <text start="647.59" dur="5.38">operation because we know that it was</text>
  <text start="650.39" dur="5.61">part of smuggling the oil from Syria</text>
  <text start="652.97" dur="5.4">into Turkey he housed the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="656" dur="6.57">he funded the Islamic state along with</text>
  <text start="658.37" dur="7.29">the United States and at this point we</text>
  <text start="662.57" dur="6.74">see that era one is getting ready to</text>
  <text start="665.66" dur="10.04">change the constitution in his country</text>
  <text start="669.31" dur="6.39">so what is going on here was her one</text>
  <text start="675.94" dur="4.15">really part of this coup or was the</text>
  <text start="678.68" dur="4.71">United States trying to get rid of her</text>
  <text start="680.09" dur="6.54">21 or were they working together because</text>
  <text start="683.39" dur="5.58">when you look at this her one at the</text>
  <text start="686.63" dur="5.55">time he was floundering he was at his</text>
  <text start="688.97" dur="5.88">weakest point his political life barely</text>
  <text start="692.18" dur="5.7">hanging by a thread he was on the outs</text>
  <text start="694.85" dur="4.44">with the US and EU powers because he was</text>
  <text start="697.88" dur="5.19">blackmailing the</text>
  <text start="699.29" dur="5.549">EU and we can see right now that what</text>
  <text start="703.07" dur="5.129">was happening in Syria that was</text>
  <text start="704.839" dur="6.06">completely falling apart and now when</text>
  <text start="708.199" dur="7.291">you look at her Dhawan he&amp;#39;s back in the</text>
  <text start="710.899" dur="9.151">driver&amp;#39;s seat he has total control he</text>
  <text start="715.49" dur="10.409">has more power than before he just moved</text>
  <text start="720.05" dur="8.729">up a notch maybe two so when we look at</text>
  <text start="725.899" dur="5.461">this we understand from the United</text>
  <text start="728.779" dur="4.29">States and NATO&amp;#39;s point of view where</text>
  <text start="731.36" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;re coming from we see the point of</text>
  <text start="733.069" dur="8.311">view of ERDA one and we understand that</text>
  <text start="736.94" dur="7.8">their entire operation was falling apart</text>
  <text start="741.38" dur="6.72">and we know the goal is still the same</text>
  <text start="744.74" dur="5.909">after all this time it&amp;#39;s hard to believe</text>
  <text start="748.1" dur="4.56">that irda one we&amp;#39;ll all of a sudden say</text>
  <text start="750.649" dur="4.67">you know what I&amp;#39;m gonna change my mind I</text>
  <text start="752.66" dur="5.46">don&amp;#39;t want to saw it out of power</text>
  <text start="755.319" dur="6.58">because he&amp;#39;s been doing this for quite a</text>
  <text start="758.12" dur="6.93">while and we know that he lies quite a</text>
  <text start="761.899" dur="5.821">bit we&amp;#39;re waiting for more indicators</text>
  <text start="765.05" dur="6.63">from Russia we&amp;#39;re meeting we&amp;#39;re waiting</text>
  <text start="767.72" dur="5.549">for more indicators from the United</text>
  <text start="771.68" dur="4.889">States because when you really think</text>
  <text start="773.269" dur="7.05">about it if her one truly believes that</text>
  <text start="776.569" dur="7.13">the US and NATO are part of this why</text>
  <text start="780.319" dur="5.971">hasn&amp;#39;t he removed the diplomats removed</text>
  <text start="783.699" dur="6.94">the individuals from the Incirlik Air</text>
  <text start="786.29" dur="8.07">Base that has not happened yet Russia</text>
  <text start="790.639" dur="5.491">and Iran yes there have been talks but</text>
  <text start="794.36" dur="3.839">nothing has gone any further at this</text>
  <text start="796.13" dur="4.709">point so we&amp;#39;re still watching for</text>
  <text start="798.199" dur="4.38">certain indicators and we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="800.839" dur="4.62">yes US and NATO they were definitely</text>
  <text start="802.579" dur="4.351">part of this but we&amp;#39;re still waiting to</text>
  <text start="805.459" dur="5.161">see what this is going to be used for</text>
  <text start="806.93" dur="9.899">and that most likely will be coming up</text>
  <text start="810.62" dur="9.029">very very soon now we see the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="816.829" dur="6.271">is out there still talking about the</text>
  <text start="819.649" dur="8.071">deal with Russia about joining forces</text>
  <text start="823.1" dur="5.839">and we understand that John Kerry came</text>
  <text start="827.72" dur="4.89">out and said something&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="828.939" dur="3.88">nailed down by August what&amp;#39;s that going</text>
  <text start="832.61" dur="1.319">to</text>
  <text start="832.819" dur="3.841">we don&amp;#39;t know because there are</text>
  <text start="833.929" dur="5.07">preconditions Assad must go they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="836.66" dur="4.379">want Syria flying their jets around they</text>
  <text start="838.999" dur="4.2">just want Russia and the United States</text>
  <text start="841.039" dur="4.05">it looks like the United States doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="843.199" dur="3.03">care about the Islamic state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="845.089" dur="3.96">just moving them to different locations</text>
  <text start="846.229" dur="6.72">we know they airlifted them out to go to</text>
  <text start="849.049" dur="6.09">Libya to go to Lebanon and we can see</text>
  <text start="852.949" dur="4.89">right now they know the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="855.139" dur="6.15">done and that&amp;#39;s why Ashton Carter was</text>
  <text start="857.839" dur="5.85">out there and we see that he was out</text>
  <text start="861.289" dur="4.76">there telling the troops that the US</text>
  <text start="863.689" dur="6.99">needs to keep the Middle East secure</text>
  <text start="866.049" dur="6.611">after the Islamic state is removed from</text>
  <text start="870.679" dur="4.291">all the countries so what that tells us</text>
  <text start="872.66" dur="4.949">is that they&amp;#39;re going to go back into</text>
  <text start="874.97" dur="5.13">the Middle Eastern countries and keep</text>
  <text start="877.609" dur="4.59">the puppet governments in control</text>
  <text start="880.1" dur="6.06">because this was their plan from the</text>
  <text start="882.199" dur="6.271">beginning since 2001 to go into Sudan</text>
  <text start="886.16" dur="6.839">which were having a problem with once</text>
  <text start="888.47" dur="8.13">again Yemen Libya Lebanon Iraq of course</text>
  <text start="892.999" dur="5.61">Syria than a ram now does that mean</text>
  <text start="896.6" dur="5.159">they&amp;#39;re just going to give up on Assad</text>
  <text start="898.609" dur="5.67">no they know this is impossible they</text>
  <text start="901.759" dur="4.8">need to continually prop up the system</text>
  <text start="904.279" dur="7.321">they need to spread the debt they need</text>
  <text start="906.559" dur="7.13">more natural resources on the dollar so</text>
  <text start="911.6" dur="5.489">they&amp;#39;re going to stop at this point no</text>
  <text start="913.689" dur="6.55">we&amp;#39;re just waiting for their next action</text>
  <text start="917.089" dur="6.21">and we can see right now that all those</text>
  <text start="920.239" dur="4.861">coalition forces in Europe where Carter</text>
  <text start="923.299" dur="4.2">run around and he said listen we need</text>
  <text start="925.1" dur="5.729">your troops we need we need your forces</text>
  <text start="927.499" dur="5.01">we need your military assets well it</text>
  <text start="930.829" dur="3.75">looks like they&amp;#39;re setting up an</text>
  <text start="932.509" dur="6.36">international coalition stabilization</text>
  <text start="934.579" dur="7.44">force which will maintain control of the</text>
  <text start="938.869" dur="6.06">Middle East and he came out and said</text>
  <text start="942.019" dur="4.98">that they have plans they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="944.929" dur="4.5">accelerate what they&amp;#39;re doing against</text>
  <text start="946.999" dur="3.9">the Islamic state now we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="949.429" dur="2.97">not really fighting the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="950.899" dur="3.36">what he&amp;#39;s really saying they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="952.399" dur="5.22">accelerate the campaign against Assad</text>
  <text start="954.259" dur="6.33">but he&amp;#39;s not ready to release what</text>
  <text start="957.619" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;re going to do as of yet because of</text>
  <text start="960.589" dur="5.22">operational security concerns so this</text>

  <text start="973.52" dur="5.46">out and the other thing that we know is</text>
  <text start="975.86" dur="4.74">that the US needs to keep the Middle</text>
