  <text start="81.28" dur="3.93">weapons from the American public and</text>
  <text start="83.65" dur="3.51">they tried doing this with many</text>
  <text start="85.21" dur="4.05">different false flags where they said</text>
  <text start="87.16" dur="5.13">the gun is the problem it&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="89.26" dur="3.93">person the person&amp;#39;s not on SSRI drugs or</text>

  <text start="102.43" dur="4.67">not the person it&amp;#39;s the gun and they</text>
  <text start="104.95" dur="4.8">tried to pass many different laws and</text>
  <text start="107.1" dur="6.67">people were cheering when the concealed</text>
  <text start="109.75" dur="6.72">carry reciprocity law was voted by the</text>

  <text start="123.46" dur="5.73">allowed gun owners to cross state lines</text>
  <text start="126.46" dur="5.4">and they were allowed to conceal their</text>
  <text start="129.19" dur="4.41">weapon but what most people didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="131.86" dur="3.99">realize is that there had been a</text>
  <text start="133.6" dur="4.59">last-minute change to the bill that</text>
  <text start="135.85" dur="4.62">could substantially increase the Nova</text>

  <text start="145.45" dur="6.6">was inserted into the bill at the last</text>
  <text start="149.14" dur="5.13">moment that many lawmakers they while</text>
  <text start="152.05" dur="6.33">they never read and many lawmakers never</text>
  <text start="154.27" dur="8.28">read the bills so what did they change</text>
  <text start="158.38" dur="7.23">what did they insert into the bill well</text>
  <text start="162.55" dur="6.62">this came on the 11th hour and the</text>
  <text start="165.61" dur="8.01">change was to help states and agencies</text>

  <text start="202.05" dur="5.13">many people could be barred from gun</text>

  <text start="253.44" dur="7.56">is fugitives fugitives from justice and</text>
  <text start="257.45" dur="9.04">that a good portion of these Americans</text>

  <text start="270.44" dur="6.729">skirt around the issue and to try to you</text>
  <text start="274.59" dur="4.17">know basically disarm the American</text>
  <text start="277.169" dur="4.171">people this is what they&amp;#39;ve been trying</text>
  <text start="278.76" dur="4.77">to do for a very long time and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="281.34" dur="4.74">have to watch us to see where this moves</text>
  <text start="283.53" dur="5.19">and how this goes forward here we see</text>
  <text start="286.08" dur="4.32">out in the UK Teresa may have suffered</text>
  <text start="288.72" dur="4.5">the first two feet over the brexit in</text>
  <text start="290.4" dur="5.04">Parliament after a majority of the MPs</text>
  <text start="293.22" dur="6.06">backed an amendment to the EU withdrawal</text>
  <text start="295.44" dur="6.45">bill now the amendment allows for MPs to</text>
  <text start="299.28" dur="6.15">have a meaningful vote on the final</text>
  <text start="301.89" dur="6.06">brexit deal now the EU withdrawal bill</text>
  <text start="305.43" dur="5.7">is an integral part of the UK&amp;#39;s exit</text>
  <text start="307.95" dur="6.63">strategy now it aims to effectively end</text>
  <text start="311.13" dur="7.89">the supremacy of the EU law and copy EU</text>
  <text start="314.58" dur="6.36">law into the UK statute book so that the</text>
  <text start="319.02" dur="4.86">same rules and regulations apply</text>
  <text start="320.94" dur="5.43">brexit Clause 9 of the bill gives</text>
  <text start="323.88" dur="5.76">ministers the power to implement brexit</text>
  <text start="326.37" dur="4.62">but with the amendment being passed they</text>
  <text start="329.64" dur="3.42">will not be able to do so until</text>
  <text start="330.99" dur="6.24">Parliament gives them the green light</text>
  <text start="333.06" dur="7.71">via a new Act of Parliament now the UK</text>
  <text start="337.23" dur="5.99">plans to leave the EU by March 2019 but</text>
  <text start="340.77" dur="6.78">it looks like the Parliament right now</text>
  <text start="343.22" dur="9.04">wants a meaningful vote and they want to</text>
  <text start="347.55" dur="7.14">basically review this now we need to</text>
  <text start="352.26" dur="5.04">remember that the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="354.69" dur="5.43">really don&amp;#39;t want the UK to leave they</text>
  <text start="357.3" dur="5.49">don&amp;#39;t want them to exit they want them</text>
  <text start="360.12" dur="6.45">to stay and they&amp;#39;re gonna do everything</text>
  <text start="362.79" dur="9.33">they possibly can up until the date to</text>
  <text start="366.57" dur="6.96">keep the UK in the EU and we see that</text>
  <text start="372.12" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re gonna continually try all</text>
  <text start="373.53" dur="5.97">different methods avenues to try to do</text>
  <text start="376.59" dur="4.59">this we see out in North Korea the</text>
  <text start="379.5" dur="3.84">Russian military delegation they have</text>
  <text start="381.18" dur="3.51">arrived in North Korea and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="383.34" dur="3.84">looking to have dialogue with North</text>
  <text start="384.69" dur="4.62">Korea and the officials are going to be</text>
  <text start="387.18" dur="4.14">remaining in North Korea for the rest of</text>
  <text start="389.31" dur="3.93">the week and what&amp;#39;s very interesting as</text>
  <text start="391.32" dur="3.96">we know that Tillerson came out and said</text>
  <text start="393.24" dur="4.58">listen we would like to have talks with</text>
  <text start="395.28" dur="6.72">North Korea with no preconditions and</text>
  <text start="397.82" dur="8.65">North Korea actually appears to be</text>
  <text start="402" dur="7.71">responding to Tillerson requests North</text>
  <text start="406.47" dur="9">Korea agrees it is important to avoid</text>
  <text start="409.71" dur="10.29">war and North Korea says they are open</text>
  <text start="415.47" dur="8.58">to any type of commitment talks we are</text>
  <text start="420" dur="6.03">open to discussion now we have China we</text>
  <text start="424.05" dur="4.29">have Russia we have the United States we</text>
  <text start="426.03" dur="5.01">have delegation of Russia in North Korea</text>
  <text start="428.34" dur="4.26">and we could see talks starting very</text>
  <text start="431.04" dur="4.11">very soon now does this mean it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="432.6" dur="5.49">happen tomorrow no but this is the</text>
  <text start="435.15" dur="5.43">beginning stages this is the feeler that</text>
  <text start="438.09" dur="5.01">they put out there and I believe by next</text>
  <text start="440.58" dur="4.08">year we&amp;#39;re gonna see many different</text>
  <text start="443.1" dur="3.39">things happen with North Korea where the</text>
  <text start="444.66" dur="3.81">whole situation is gonna calm down and</text>
  <text start="446.49" dur="4.56">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is take the</text>
  <text start="448.47" dur="3.78">power away from the Cabal this is what</text>
  <text start="451.05" dur="3.479">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to do for a very</text>
  <text start="452.25" dur="4.829">long time to remove the</text>
  <text start="454.529" dur="5.19">power from the Cabal and there are</text>
  <text start="457.079" dur="5.13">certain strategies that need to be done</text>
  <text start="459.719" dur="6.06">to take away the power now one is to</text>
  <text start="462.209" dur="5.97">make North Korea a nuclear state because</text>
  <text start="465.779" dur="4.29">the Cabal they don&amp;#39;t like to invade or</text>
  <text start="468.179" dur="4.02">they don&amp;#39;t like to push an event with a</text>
  <text start="470.069" dur="6.96">nuclear country that has nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="472.199" dur="9.09">and we see right now the Cabal right now</text>
  <text start="477.029" dur="5.88">is losing ground in the Middle East they</text>
  <text start="481.289" dur="4.98">are struggling right now</text>
  <text start="482.909" dur="5.07">Surya seems to be a lost cause and all</text>
  <text start="486.269" dur="4.44">the countries that they have regime</text>
  <text start="487.979" dur="5.13">change in well it&amp;#39;s all starting to fall</text>
  <text start="490.709" dur="4.77">apart now the UN was out there and</text>
  <text start="493.109" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re saying that South Sudan needs</text>
  <text start="495.479" dur="5.58">about 1.7 billion in aid next year to</text>
  <text start="498.149" dur="5.64">help six million people this is half of</text>
  <text start="501.059" dur="4.32">its population why do they need this</text>
  <text start="503.789" dur="3.65">because they need to cope with the</text>
  <text start="505.379" dur="4.98">effects of war hunger economic decline</text>
  <text start="507.439" dur="6.31">now we need to understand the United</text>
  <text start="510.359" dur="5.131">States the Cabal in every country</text>
  <text start="513.749" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;ve been in where they have regime</text>
  <text start="515.49" dur="5.819">change were started a war to have regime</text>
  <text start="517.499" dur="5.58">change all these countries are dealing</text>
  <text start="521.309" dur="4.32">with the same thing hunger</text>
  <text start="523.079" dur="5.07">economic decline they all need</text>
  <text start="525.629" dur="5.551">humanitarian aid they all need billions</text>
  <text start="528.149" dur="7.13">and billions of dollars we see refugees</text>
  <text start="531.18" dur="9">from Sudan Somalia Libya Lebanon Iraq</text>
  <text start="535.279" dur="7.42">Syria Ukraine I mean do we not see the</text>
  <text start="540.18" dur="5.699">pattern here of what the Cabal has been</text>
  <text start="542.699" dur="7.08">doing they&amp;#39;ve been creating these</text>
  <text start="545.879" dur="7.231">problems to keep their system alive</text>
  <text start="549.779" dur="7.471">trillions and trillions of the taxpayers</text>
  <text start="553.11" dur="7.169">monies wasted to keep them very wealthy</text>
  <text start="557.25" dur="7.92">and in control that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="560.279" dur="7.021">doing we see out in Libya Russia is</text>
  <text start="565.17" dur="5.07">ready to consider easing an arms embargo</text>
  <text start="567.3" dur="6.029">for Libya now Russia right now is</text>
  <text start="570.24" dur="5.689">backing general half-car we see that</text>
  <text start="573.329" dur="6.42">Russia is looking to have peace in Libya</text>
  <text start="575.929" dur="5.26">after has been asking for weapons and we</text>
  <text start="579.749" dur="4.111">can see that the UN backed government</text>
  <text start="581.189" dur="4.351">which was chosen for the people there</text>
  <text start="583.86" dur="3.75">was no democracy there was no election</text>
  <text start="585.54" dur="2.82">there was nothing they were chosen this</text>
  <text start="587.61" dur="2.849">group of in</text>
  <text start="588.36" dur="4.469">vigils to say this is what you will</text>
  <text start="590.459" dur="7.411">accept then well people are rejecting</text>
  <text start="592.829" dur="8.851">them and we see right now that this arms</text>
  <text start="597.87" dur="7.409">embargo might be lifted to help push the</text>
  <text start="601.68" dur="5.909">agenda of getting rid of the Islamic</text>
  <text start="605.279" dur="3.93">state that is still in Libya because</text>
  <text start="607.589" dur="4.711">they&amp;#39;ve been flown from Syria and Iraq</text>
  <text start="609.209" dur="5.25">into Libya and they might be saying</text>
  <text start="612.3" dur="5.46">listen it&amp;#39;s time to stop this in Libya</text>
  <text start="614.459" dur="5.31">and we need peace in this area so we</text>
  <text start="617.76" dur="5.069">need to send weapons over there to</text>
  <text start="619.769" dur="5.82">remove the Islamic state we see the US</text>
  <text start="622.829" dur="8.19">Congress they&amp;#39;ve missed the deadline to</text>
  <text start="625.589" dur="7.891">decide on reimposing Iran sanctions so</text>
  <text start="631.019" dur="5.551">they were lifted under the 2015 nuclear</text>
  <text start="633.48" dur="5.46">deal Congress has so far announced no</text>
  <text start="636.57" dur="5.55">plans to introduce a resolution to</text>
  <text start="638.94" dur="5.88">reimpose sanctions it looks like that is</text>
  <text start="642.12" dur="4.529">falling apart right now and Iran is</text>
  <text start="644.82" dur="6.449">going to join the Eurasian Economic</text>
  <text start="646.649" dur="6.451">Union by February 2018 so when we look</text>
  <text start="651.269" dur="4.621">at the entire situation we can see that</text>
  <text start="653.1" dur="5.64">everything in the Middle East is falling</text>
  <text start="655.89" dur="6">apart for the Cabal we see the countries</text>
  <text start="658.74" dur="5.37">are starting to take over and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="661.89" dur="4.62">trying they&amp;#39;re trying to control the</text>
  <text start="664.11" dur="5.88">situation in their countries like Syria</text>
  <text start="666.51" dur="6.78">has done like Iraq is doing like Lebanon</text>
  <text start="669.99" dur="6.33">is doing and we could see with Trump</text>
  <text start="673.29" dur="6.479">saying that Jerusalem is the capital of</text>
  <text start="676.32" dur="7.379">Israel well we see the Middle Eastern</text>
  <text start="679.769" dur="6.81">countries banding together actually the</text>
  <text start="683.699" dur="6.32">Organization of Islamic Cooperation has</text>
  <text start="686.579" dur="6.931">invited all nations to recognize</text>
  <text start="690.019" dur="8.891">Jerusalem that&amp;#39;s the East part of</text>
  <text start="693.51" dur="8.67">Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine so</text>
  <text start="698.91" dur="5.1">what has been done here it is allowed</text>
  <text start="702.18" dur="4.83">those Middle Eastern countries which</text>
  <text start="704.01" dur="8.49">were controlled by the Cabal to have a</text>
  <text start="707.01" dur="9.12">common ground to work together to get</text>
  <text start="712.5" dur="7.17">things done and the Middle East is now</text>
  <text start="716.13" dur="6">pivoting away from the United States</text>
  <text start="719.67" dur="4.74">pivoting towards Russia</text>
  <text start="722.13" dur="5.579">and China now this was done on purpose</text>
  <text start="724.41" dur="6.09">this was the strategy the United States</text>
  <text start="727.709" dur="6.24">will no longer be the peacemaker in the</text>
  <text start="730.5" dur="5.13">Middle East Congress because we know we</text>
  <text start="733.949" dur="4.021">have foreign entities controlling</text>
  <text start="735.63" dur="5.189">Congress certain senators certain</text>
  <text start="737.97" dur="5.01">representatives they will no longer be</text>
  <text start="740.819" dur="5.19">handling what is happening in the Middle</text>
  <text start="742.98" dur="4.5">East which means certain countries in</text>
  <text start="746.009" dur="4.801">the Middle East like Israel and others</text>
  <text start="747.48" dur="4.62">will not have their hands in Congress</text>
  <text start="750.81" dur="3.899">because it will make no difference</text>
  <text start="752.1" dur="5.609">everything will be pushed towards Russia</text>
  <text start="754.709" dur="5.341">and China and the Middle Eastern</text>
  <text start="757.709" dur="5.731">countries will make their own decisions</text>
  <text start="760.05" dur="6.36">and we can see this is part of the</text>
  <text start="763.44" dur="6.6">strategy plus there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="766.41" dur="4.979">pivot away from the petro dollar we see</text>
  <text start="770.04" dur="3.33">right now a large number of</text>

  <text start="782.639" dur="3.841">trying to mount a major offensive and it</text>
  <text start="785.22" dur="3.599">looks like this is going absolutely</text>
  <text start="786.48" dur="6.029">nowhere now</text>
  <text start="788.819" dur="6.96">we talked a lot about cyberattacks and</text>
  <text start="792.509" dur="6.091">we know that the Cabal the central banks</text>
  <text start="795.779" dur="7.081">they will be using some type of an event</text>
  <text start="798.6" dur="6.21">to cover up this economic downfall now</text>
  <text start="802.86" dur="3.51">each one of these factions they have</text>
  <text start="804.81" dur="3.629">their own reasons for the event they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="806.37" dur="4.44">not always working with each other</text>
  <text start="808.439" dur="5.07">sometimes they&amp;#39;re not so for instance</text>
  <text start="810.81" dur="5.73">like the Cabal all the corruption all</text>
  <text start="813.509" dur="6.541">the stolen funds from the pentagon all</text>
  <text start="816.54" dur="4.859">the backroom deals everything that is</text>
  <text start="820.05" dur="3.959">coming out now</text>
  <text start="821.399" dur="5.43">well they want an event to distract from</text>
  <text start="824.009" dur="5.58">that the central bank&amp;#39;s they want to</text>
  <text start="826.829" dur="4.62">they want an event to distract from the</text>
  <text start="829.589" dur="3.391">collapsing economy remember the central</text>

  <text start="832.98" dur="2.849">of the central bank in many different</text>
  <text start="834.089" dur="4.141">central banks but there&amp;#39;s main there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="835.829" dur="4.74">one main central bank that&amp;#39;s the biz</text>
  <text start="838.23" dur="7.62">which is really run by the Rothschild</text>
  <text start="840.569" dur="7.411">and they don&amp;#39;t want people to understand</text>
  <text start="845.85" dur="4.56">what is going on with a collapsing</text>
  <text start="847.98" dur="4.14">economy where it&amp;#39;s blamed on the central</text>
  <text start="850.41" dur="4.169">bank they don&amp;#39;t want people to connect</text>
  <text start="852.12" dur="3.409">the dots to say hey oh we know why this</text>
  <text start="854.579" dur="2.3">happened because</text>
  <text start="855.529" dur="3.711">was the Federal Reserve oh it was the</text>
  <text start="856.879" dur="6.301">ECB it was the central banking system</text>
  <text start="859.24" dur="5.5">that failed that&amp;#39;s why everything is</text>
  <text start="863.18" dur="3.269">falling apart they don&amp;#39;t want people to</text>
  <text start="864.74" dur="3.69">know this so different factions the</text>
  <text start="866.449" dur="3.57">neocons have their reasons they all have</text>
  <text start="868.43" dur="3.839">their different reasons and they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="870.019" dur="3.42">trying to push certain events now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="872.269" dur="3.06">very interesting the Middle East as</text>
  <text start="873.439" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re joining forces and they are</text>
  <text start="875.329" dur="4.98">having a common ground Saudi Arabia is</text>
  <text start="877.129" dur="7.291">also pivoting they might cyberattack</text>
  <text start="880.309" dur="6.33">OPEC because if OPEC or when OPEC</text>
  <text start="884.42" dur="3.779">decides that you know something we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="886.639" dur="4.291">gonna pivot towards Russia and China and</text>
  <text start="888.199" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re slowly doing this well the</text>
  <text start="890.93" dur="5.339">central bank&amp;#39;s the cabal they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="893.629" dur="4.531">gonna be too happy with this and we see</text>
  <text start="896.269" dur="3.12">that there have been a lot of cyber</text>
  <text start="898.16" dur="4.2">attacks in the Middle East and they</text>
  <text start="899.389" dur="7.651">target the oil and gas industries and if</text>
  <text start="902.36" dur="6.81">this happens they can use this as part</text>
  <text start="907.04" dur="3.959">of an excuse of why this system is</text>
  <text start="909.17" dur="3.18">breaking down think about this for a</text>
  <text start="910.999" dur="3.83">second because the whole entire system</text>
  <text start="912.35" dur="7.77">is based on the petro dollar system if</text>
  <text start="914.829" dur="8.44">the Middle East Saudi Arabia Iraq guitar</text>
  <text start="920.12" dur="6.18">all these countries if they&amp;#39;re hit with</text>
  <text start="923.269" dur="4.711">a cyberattack and the oil industry is</text>
  <text start="926.3" dur="4.529">brought to its knees</text>
  <text start="927.98" dur="6.27">well they have their explanation of why</text>
  <text start="930.829" dur="6.18">the system is destroyed it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="934.25" dur="4.98">simple thing to say that oh maybe the</text>
  <text start="937.009" dur="5.101">Islamic state did this for revenge</text>
  <text start="939.23" dur="4.229">maybe it was North Korea maybe it was</text>
  <text start="942.11" dur="2.55">Russia or China maybe they&amp;#39;ll try to</text>
  <text start="943.459" dur="4.35">pull that card out but I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="944.66" dur="6.599">it&amp;#39;s gonna work but this is one way they</text>
  <text start="947.809" dur="5.671">can do it and they can say this is why</text>
  <text start="951.259" dur="5.161">the system is breaking down and they can</text>
  <text start="953.48" dur="4.469">even put on top of that cyber attacks in</text>
  <text start="956.42" dur="4.44">Europe cyber attack in the United States</text>
  <text start="957.949" dur="5.101">and blame this all on a group now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="960.86" dur="4.019">very interesting as we know site</text>
  <text start="963.05" dur="4.019">intelligence which is run by Drita cats</text>
  <text start="964.879" dur="3.93">which is a propaganda outfit for the</text>
  <text start="967.069" dur="6.031">Islamic state because we know that</text>
  <text start="968.809" dur="6.27">Israel the United States UK and many</text>
  <text start="973.1" dur="3.719">other countries they&amp;#39;re all involved in</text>
  <text start="975.079" dur="7.32">this paid mercenary because the Cabal is</text>
  <text start="976.819" dur="7.531">very large and it&amp;#39;s integrated into many</text>
  <text start="982.399" dur="4.62">different countries now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="984.35" dur="4.78">interesting is that the anonymous</text>
  <text start="987.019" dur="4.241">community has said</text>
  <text start="989.13" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;ve hacked into the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="991.26" dur="4.77">account now what I think has happened is</text>
  <text start="992.67" dur="6.12">this was allowed to be done and they</text>
  <text start="996.03" dur="6.18">were allowed to get this information and</text>
  <text start="998.79" dur="6.87">they wanted it pushed out to the public</text>
  <text start="1002.21" dur="5.79">as propaganda where the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1005.66" dur="4.98">now of course the Islamic state as we</text>
  <text start="1008" dur="4.8">know is the paid mercenary force of the</text>
  <text start="1010.64" dur="4.23">cabal they wanted it out there</text>
  <text start="1012.8" dur="5.61">to show that they are getting prepared</text>
  <text start="1014.87" dur="6.63">and ready to do something in New York</text>
  <text start="1018.41" dur="5.28">and in many different cities and they</text>
  <text start="1021.5" dur="4.8">showed different pictures of you know we</text>
  <text start="1023.69" dur="4.649">meet at Christmas in New York soon and</text>
  <text start="1026.3" dur="5.58">they have all these pictures showing</text>
  <text start="1028.339" dur="6.781">that they&amp;#39;re ready to maybe have certain</text>
  <text start="1031.88" dur="5.79">type of explosions in the city and as we</text>
  <text start="1035.12" dur="5.25">know there was a pipe bomb that exploded</text>
  <text start="1037.67" dur="5.58">in New York City and the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1040.37" dur="5.01">you said this was part of their attempt</text>
  <text start="1043.25" dur="4.949">to have some type of an event and</text>
  <text start="1045.38" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re saying that the other events</text>
  <text start="1048.199" dur="3.991">that are coming are going to be much</text>
  <text start="1050.09" dur="4.11">much larger and what I think is</text>
  <text start="1052.19" dur="5.31">happening right now is they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="1054.2" dur="5.1">prepared for a very large event and this</text>
  <text start="1057.5" dur="4.44">is the propaganda leading up to it now</text>
  <text start="1059.3" dur="4.62">this is going to be wrapped with cyber</text>
  <text start="1061.94" dur="3.96">attacks and they&amp;#39;re gonna use both</text>
  <text start="1063.92" dur="4.14">physical and cyber attacks because they</text>
  <text start="1065.9" dur="5.82">need to show that the system is coming</text>
  <text start="1068.06" dur="5.94">down and like I said the Fed is already</text>
  <text start="1071.72" dur="4.29">raising the interest rates so all the</text>
  <text start="1074" dur="5.19">pieces are coming together they need an</text>
  <text start="1076.01" dur="6.45">event they need to show that Trump was</text>
  <text start="1079.19" dur="5.58">responsible for all this and they need</text>
  <text start="1082.46" dur="6.51">to bring the system down and it looks</text>
  <text start="1084.77" dur="5.91">like they&amp;#39;re headed into this time frame</text>
  <text start="1088.97" dur="4.35">of where they&amp;#39;re going to do it because</text>
  <text start="1090.68" dur="8.39">think about the Middle East right now is</text>
  <text start="1093.32" dur="8.93">lost the petro dollar is declining in</text>
  <text start="1099.07" dur="7">usage because of the petrol you want and</text>
  <text start="1102.25" dur="5.23">it&amp;#39;s only a matter of time before the</text>
  <text start="1106.07" dur="3">Middle Eastern countries which they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1107.48" dur="3.45">already starting to do band together and</text>
  <text start="1109.07" dur="5.37">say you know something we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1110.93" dur="5.52">drop it once this happens it&amp;#39;s game over</text>
  <text start="1114.44" dur="5.55">for the Cabal for the Central Bank for</text>
  <text start="1116.45" dur="6.17">everything and they know this so time</text>
  <text start="1119.99" dur="5.42">the clock I should say is ticking down</text>
  <text start="1122.62" dur="4.98">now and they don&amp;#39;t have that much time</text>
  <text start="1125.41" dur="4.35">left this is why they&amp;#39;re pushing all</text>
  <text start="1127.6" dur="4.41">this propaganda out there and we can</text>
  <text start="1129.76" dur="4.56">also see you know the peace talks are</text>
  <text start="1132.01" dur="4.71">starting in North Korea and they want to</text>
  <text start="1134.32" dur="4.88">get this event off the ground now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1136.72" dur="5.46">very interesting is that Switzerland is</text>
  <text start="1139.2" dur="6.37">well prepared for any type of</text>
  <text start="1142.18" dur="7.02">civilization collapse more perhaps than</text>
  <text start="1145.57" dur="5.97">any other nation and the reason I say</text>
  <text start="1149.2" dur="3.81">this is that they have a decentralized</text>
  <text start="1151.54" dur="4.68">government the kind America was supposed</text>
  <text start="1153.01" dur="5.91">to have when the entire country was</text>
  <text start="1156.22" dur="4.32">founded and it makes it possible for</text>
  <text start="1158.92" dur="3.45">Switzerland to be prepared for a</text>
  <text start="1160.54" dur="3.84">collapse now the mountains and valleys</text>
  <text start="1162.37" dur="3.84">mean that Swiss towns and villages are</text>
  <text start="1164.38" dur="4.71">geographically independent of each other</text>
  <text start="1166.21" dur="5.01">yet linked in a spiderweb of robust</text>
  <text start="1169.09" dur="4.5">connections but that&amp;#39;s not all</text>
  <text start="1171.22" dur="4.53">the Swiss towns are prepared for water</text>
  <text start="1173.59" dur="4.55">system failures which would affect the</text>
  <text start="1175.75" dur="4.62">ability to access clean water all around</text>
  <text start="1178.14" dur="4.87">Switzerland there are thousands of water</text>
  <text start="1180.37" dur="5.96">fountains fed by natural springs Zurich</text>
  <text start="1183.01" dur="7.4">is famous for its 1,200 fountains and</text>
  <text start="1186.33" dur="7.33">other examples are there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1190.41" dur="6.09">well-prepared Swiss they&amp;#39;re ready for</text>
  <text start="1193.66" dur="4.95">any type of threat they have hidden</text>
  <text start="1196.5" dur="5.2">hydroelectric dams built inside of</text>
  <text start="1198.61" dur="5.13">unmarked mountains set so that an event</text>
  <text start="1201.7" dur="3.84">of a mass bombing they&amp;#39;ll still have</text>
  <text start="1203.74" dur="4.38">electricity from these secret facilities</text>
  <text start="1205.54" dur="4.97">and remember these are the things the</text>
  <text start="1208.12" dur="5.309">Swiss government has let us know about</text>
  <text start="1210.51" dur="5.14">all the other things are still hidden</text>
  <text start="1213.429" dur="5.221">now buried deep alongside the</text>

  <text start="1232.27" dur="6.3">even older formats like floppy disks so</text>
  <text start="1235.5" dur="8.26">we can see right now they are definitely</text>
  <text start="1238.57" dur="7.859">prepared for something to hit and there</text>
  <text start="1243.76" dur="5.87">they&amp;#39;re prepared enough where the</text>
