  <text start="106.11" dur="3.46">depending some days it&amp;#39;s a little bit</text>
  <text start="108.31" dur="3.36">earlier some days a little bit later but</text>
  <text start="109.57" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s always around that time and YouTube</text>

  <text start="128.47" dur="6.06">get into the economic collapse news and</text>
  <text start="131.879" dur="5.851">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="134.53" dur="6.39">consumer confidence is missing the</text>
  <text start="137.73" dur="7">expectations by by most on record</text>
  <text start="140.92" dur="6.39">and this is the biggest miss since 1999</text>
  <text start="144.73" dur="4.229">and it appears that people are finally</text>
  <text start="147.31" dur="4.59">starting to wake up and they&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="148.959" dur="6.391">that you know mortgage rates are you</text>
  <text start="151.9" dur="6.27">know rising gas prices are rising and</text>
  <text start="155.35" dur="6.09">now there is a lag in the gas prices we</text>
  <text start="158.17" dur="8.819">know that the price per barrel on the</text>
  <text start="161.44" dur="8.16">oil is going up but people are not</text>
  <text start="166.989" dur="4.111">seeing it yet at the gas pumps and they</text>
  <text start="169.6" dur="2.82">will actually I mean the prices have</text>
  <text start="171.1" dur="3">gone up a little bit but they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="172.42" dur="5.1">to start to see the prices start to move</text>
  <text start="174.1" dur="5.55">up now and they have seen that food</text>
  <text start="177.52" dur="5.249">especially I mean I keep track of it</text>
  <text start="179.65" dur="5.64">that has gone up I see milk rose up</text>
  <text start="182.769" dur="5.701">again I think on my side I had it at 385</text>
  <text start="185.29" dur="5.64">now it&amp;#39;s at 389 we see products being</text>
  <text start="188.47" dur="5.61">shrunk down so people are starting to</text>
  <text start="190.93" dur="7.14">notice this and and they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="194.08" dur="6.12">realize that something is going on here</text>
  <text start="198.07" dur="5.28">and it&amp;#39;s costing them more money to do</text>
  <text start="200.2" dur="4.65">the things they normally did and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="203.35" dur="3.69">just trying to figure out why this is</text>
  <text start="204.85" dur="7.979">happening and this is why this is</text>
  <text start="207.04" dur="8.82">starting to drop now if things are going</text>
  <text start="212.829" dur="5.431">so well in the economy we have a certain</text>
  <text start="215.86" dur="4.77">number of indicators that have been</text>
  <text start="218.26" dur="5.729">showing us that things aren&amp;#39;t going well</text>
  <text start="220.63" dur="5.97">I mean we saw retail sales showing a</text>
  <text start="223.989" dur="4.59">decline in people going out purchasing</text>
  <text start="226.6" dur="3.479">items they really don&amp;#39;t need or they</text>
  <text start="228.579" dur="4.801">don&amp;#39;t need right now so they&amp;#39;re putting</text>
  <text start="230.079" dur="5.91">it off we see a housing starting to fall</text>
  <text start="233.38" dur="4.59">now mortgage applications taking the</text>
  <text start="235.989" dur="4.681">plunge builders are telling us the</text>
  <text start="237.97" dur="5.76">traffic is starting to ease up and</text>
  <text start="240.67" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;re not seeing as many sales and now</text>
  <text start="243.73" dur="6.66">in Chicago they are having a bit of a</text>
  <text start="246.76" dur="6.69">problem they are closing around 50</text>
  <text start="250.39" dur="5.55">schools and this is going to add of</text>
  <text start="253.45" dur="7.23">course to those people unemployed that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="255.94" dur="6.99">50 public schools and you multiply that</text>
  <text start="260.68" dur="7.41">out and that&amp;#39;s more jobs of people being</text>
  <text start="262.93" dur="8.91">let go and and the judge has cleared the</text>
  <text start="268.09" dur="5.55">way for this to happen we&amp;#39;re also seeing</text>
  <text start="271.84" dur="2.849">that the Fed of course is losing the</text>
  <text start="273.64" dur="3.389">inflation battle</text>
  <text start="274.689" dur="5.82">you know they&amp;#39;ve changed the calculation</text>
  <text start="277.029" dur="5.67">for inflation to make sure that all the</text>
  <text start="280.509" dur="3.601">sleeping people in the US and across the</text>
  <text start="282.699" dur="3.06">world are saying oh no look</text>
  <text start="284.11" dur="4.109">unemployment&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="285.759" dur="5.16">inflation is keeping it whatever 2</text>
  <text start="288.219" dur="4.2">percent they&amp;#39;re pretending it is and you</text>
  <text start="290.919" dur="4.5">know no one&amp;#39;s noticing anything</text>
  <text start="292.419" dur="5.61">different meanwhile companies have been</text>
  <text start="295.419" dur="4.441">resizing packages like for instance</text>
  <text start="298.029" dur="4.05">Breyers ice cream</text>
  <text start="299.86" dur="5.789">they have shrunk their gallon it&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="302.079" dur="6.48">longer a gallon of ice cream it&amp;#39;s much</text>
  <text start="305.649" dur="4.89">smaller and I mean they&amp;#39;re half gallon I</text>
  <text start="308.559" dur="4.11">think it is now it&amp;#39;s much smaller and</text>
  <text start="310.539" dur="5.13">we&amp;#39;re seeing this and many other</text>
  <text start="312.669" dur="5.64">different products plus we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="315.669" dur="5.31">those who can&amp;#39;t really shrink it the</text>
  <text start="318.309" dur="5.82">prices are going up and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="320.979" dur="5.96">this mainly on the fresh food and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="324.129" dur="6.81">not talking about the chemically altered</text>
  <text start="326.939" dur="5.56">food that&amp;#39;s boxed you know that you find</text>
  <text start="330.939" dur="3.75">in the middle of the supermarket because</text>
  <text start="332.499" dur="4.5">those are all chemically altered and</text>
  <text start="334.689" dur="3.78">most of it&amp;#39;s not even food most of us</text>
  <text start="336.999" dur="4.051">just chemicals that make it look like</text>
  <text start="338.469" dur="7.41">food I&amp;#39;m talking about real fresh fruit</text>
  <text start="341.05" dur="6.919">like apples oranges milk fresh orange</text>
  <text start="345.879" dur="5.55">juice with nothing but oranges in there</text>
  <text start="347.969" dur="8.02">things like that that&amp;#39;s where the prices</text>
  <text start="351.429" dur="7.59">are going up and you definitely notice a</text>
  <text start="355.989" dur="5.55">difference I notice a difference and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="359.019" dur="4.89">sure that most of everyone else notices</text>
  <text start="361.539" dur="3.5">a difference and the inflation is</text>
  <text start="363.909" dur="5.13">starting to get away now</text>
  <text start="365.039" dur="6.22">especially now that countries are</text>
  <text start="369.039" dur="4.71">bypassing the US dollar as the reserve</text>
  <text start="371.259" dur="5.9">currency and making trades using other</text>
  <text start="373.749" dur="5.551">currencies mostly China is doing this</text>
  <text start="377.159" dur="4.451">and making deals with many different</text>
  <text start="379.3" dur="4.56">countries those dollars that aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="381.61" dur="5.819">being used are coming back where well</text>
  <text start="383.86" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re coming back to the US and we see</text>
  <text start="387.429" dur="4.65">in many of the nations who are dumping</text>
  <text start="389.8" dur="4.769">their dollars they&amp;#39;re buying gold and</text>
  <text start="392.079" dur="5.07">precious precious metals instead to get</text>
  <text start="394.569" dur="4.71">rid of their dollars and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="397.149" dur="7.95">this all happening all over the world</text>
  <text start="399.279" dur="8.35">right now okay now talking about dollars</text>
  <text start="405.099" dur="6.16">and cutting</text>
  <text start="407.629" dur="5.731">and you know cutting prices inflation</text>
  <text start="411.259" dur="5.101">and all this other stuff we know that</text>
  <text start="413.36" dur="5.489">the Obama administration has implemented</text>
  <text start="416.36" dur="4.979">the sequester and they are shutting down</text>
  <text start="418.849" dur="4.56">the space surveillance system and this</text>
  <text start="421.339" dur="4.771">is the space fence which is officially</text>
  <text start="423.409" dur="7.861">known as the u.s. air force surveillance</text>
  <text start="426.11" dur="8.429">system and it lets us know it tracks</text>
  <text start="431.27" dur="5.369">you know satellites meteors space debris</text>
  <text start="434.539" dur="4.41">and anything heading towards the earth</text>
  <text start="436.639" dur="4.56">but because of the sequester they just</text>
  <text start="438.949" dur="4.56">don&amp;#39;t have enough money to keep this</text>
  <text start="441.199" dur="6.03">going but instead they have enough money</text>
  <text start="443.509" dur="6.18">to continue the aid to the Egyptian army</text>
  <text start="447.229" dur="6.09">they had they have enough money to pay</text>
  <text start="449.689" dur="6.301">for the police officers that went from</text>
  <text start="453.319" dur="5.07">the Assad&amp;#39;s army over to the rebels and</text>
  <text start="455.99" dur="4.949">they&amp;#39;re paying for this salary we have</text>
  <text start="458.389" dur="5.37">enough money to purchase weapons to send</text>
  <text start="460.939" dur="5.91">over to Syria to the paid mercenaries</text>
  <text start="463.759" dur="5.61">there we have enough money to give aid</text>
  <text start="466.849" dur="5.19">to the Yemen government and this is not</text>
  <text start="469.369" dur="5.461">like $20,000 this is millions upon</text>
  <text start="472.039" dur="6.69">millions and millions of dollars and we</text>
  <text start="474.83" dur="9.389">have this amount of money to give to all</text>
  <text start="478.729" dur="7.77">of these places but not to America makes</text>
  <text start="484.219" dur="5.66">you think and wonder what&amp;#39;s really going</text>
  <text start="486.499" dur="8.52">on here which we do know what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="489.879" dur="8.95">now housing the housing starts permits</text>
  <text start="495.019" dur="7.55">they miss and the single-family housing</text>
  <text start="498.829" dur="8.25">market is the weakest since 2012 and</text>
  <text start="502.569" dur="6.4">what&amp;#39;s happening is again there are so</text>
  <text start="507.079" dur="6.541">many foreclosures still on the books of</text>
  <text start="508.969" dur="7.8">the banks the Fed is continually</text>
  <text start="513.62" dur="7.319">purchasing between 40 and 45 billion of</text>
  <text start="516.769" dur="5.851">these toxic real estate bore gauges that</text>
  <text start="520.939" dur="3.45">are on their books and they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="522.62" dur="6.449">spending forty to forty five billion on</text>
  <text start="524.389" dur="6.781">the Treasury bonds and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="529.069" dur="3.12">now is many people have foreclosed on</text>
  <text start="531.17" dur="2.399">their house which means they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="532.189" dur="2.911">good credit anymore which is</text>
  <text start="533.569" dur="3.181">understandable because this is what</text>
  <text start="535.1" dur="3.359">happens they can&amp;#39;t pay their credit</text>
  <text start="536.75" dur="3.54">cards they lose their jobs they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="538.459" dur="3.061">underemployed and we&amp;#39;re seeing this and</text>
  <text start="540.29" dur="3.99">if we use the real</text>
  <text start="541.52" dur="6.12">calculation prior to 1994 we said that</text>
  <text start="544.28" dur="6.23">unemployment is 23% even though they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="547.64" dur="5.25">reporting it at seven point four now</text>
  <text start="550.51" dur="3.88">with the amount of short sales with the</text>
  <text start="552.89" dur="5.85">amount of foreclosures with the amount</text>
  <text start="554.39" dur="6.81">of toxic real estate still on the books</text>
  <text start="558.74" dur="4.2">of the banks and the Fed continually</text>
  <text start="561.2" dur="4.71">purchasing they haven&amp;#39;t let up they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="562.94" dur="5.54">still doing it we&amp;#39;re not seeing people</text>
  <text start="565.91" dur="7.5">going out and buying single-family homes</text>
  <text start="568.48" dur="8.53">what homes are being purchased we are</text>
  <text start="573.41" dur="6.27">seeing that the purchasing is in the</text>
  <text start="577.01" dur="6.11">multifamily homes who are buying these</text>
  <text start="579.68" dur="7.29">multi-family homes hedge funds and</text>
  <text start="583.12" dur="6.55">investors to rent them out this is where</text>
  <text start="586.97" dur="5.88">the sales are and if you start breaking</text>
  <text start="589.67" dur="5.84">it down you start to realize the housing</text>
  <text start="592.85" dur="6.45">recovery there is no housing recovery</text>
  <text start="595.51" dur="8.53">this is most of these funds buying this</text>
  <text start="599.3" dur="9.15">plus they&amp;#39;re purchasing these homes in</text>
  <text start="604.04" dur="7.83">cash we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of foreign</text>
  <text start="608.45" dur="6.68">investors coming in and buying homes for</text>
  <text start="611.87" dur="6.15">cash and we&amp;#39;re seeing this happen all</text>
  <text start="615.13" dur="7.99">over the place so the housing recovery</text>
  <text start="618.02" dur="8.64">is not really recovering like it I like</text>
  <text start="623.12" dur="5.91">the boom before 2008 where Americans</text>
  <text start="626.66" dur="4.8">were going out and buying single-family</text>
  <text start="629.03" dur="3.98">homes and you couldn&amp;#39;t even find a home</text>
  <text start="631.46" dur="3.84">and they couldn&amp;#39;t build them fast enough</text>
  <text start="633.01" dur="4.45">because everyone was buying homes and</text>
  <text start="635.3" dur="4.08">yes there were investors buying homes</text>
  <text start="637.46" dur="7.7">for flipping and things like that but</text>
  <text start="639.38" dur="8.22">now those Americans and many Americans</text>
  <text start="645.16" dur="4.3">can&amp;#39;t do it anymore</text>
  <text start="647.6" dur="3.98">they don&amp;#39;t have the credit they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="649.46" dur="7.89">have the money they don&amp;#39;t have the jobs</text>
  <text start="651.58" dur="7.96">their wealth 38 percent of the Americans</text>
  <text start="657.35" dur="3.87">wealth has been wiped out now take all</text>
  <text start="659.54" dur="3.03">that into consideration and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="661.22" dur="3.33">trying to tell us there&amp;#39;s a housing boom</text>
  <text start="662.57" dur="4.53">because Americans are going out and</text>
  <text start="664.55" dur="9.62">buying houses again does it really make</text>
  <text start="667.1" dur="9.62">sense no it doesn&amp;#39;t now we see</text>
  <text start="674.17" dur="6.38">because of the economic collapse we see</text>
  <text start="676.72" dur="7.44">war is starting to build now across the</text>
  <text start="680.55" dur="8.2">world and we see the Middle East right</text>
  <text start="684.16" dur="8.64">now we see what&amp;#39;s happening we see the</text>
  <text start="688.75" dur="7.68">terrorist threat locking down the Middle</text>
  <text start="692.8" dur="7.14">East continue the drone strikes we see</text>
  <text start="696.43" dur="6.33">Japan and China having a conflict over</text>
  <text start="699.94" dur="6.2">an island for natural resources we see</text>
  <text start="702.76" dur="5.76">Russia and China backing Syria we see</text>
  <text start="706.14" dur="8.37">exercises with United States and Japan</text>
  <text start="708.52" dur="9.9">on how to take over an island we see</text>

  <text start="972.76" dur="4.89">al Qaeda presence in there and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="975.64" dur="4.73">why the CIA deputy director came out</text>
  <text start="977.65" dur="6.12">said saying that the biggest threat is</text>
  <text start="980.37" dur="5.68">al Qaeda if the US government can get</text>
  <text start="983.77" dur="6.12">into Syria and set up a government that</text>
  <text start="986.05" dur="7.02">al Qaeda would be in there taking over</text>
  <text start="989.89" dur="5.27">and really this is a ploy so the United</text>

  <text start="1001.56" dur="6.15">in Syria from al Qaeda we need to go in</text>
  <text start="1005.79" dur="5.58">there I mean the US government needs to</text>
  <text start="1007.71" dur="7.11">say that we need to go in there and they</text>
  <text start="1011.37" dur="7.68">try to assassinate Assad in his</text>

  <text start="1136.29" dur="5.49">the US government with everything that</text>
  <text start="1139.32" dur="4.59">they need to do is get the guns away</text>
  <text start="1141.78" dur="4.74">from the American people because they</text>
  <text start="1143.91" dur="6.18">are most scared of Americans having guns</text>
  <text start="1146.52" dur="7.95">and an armed people is the worst thing</text>
  <text start="1150.09" dur="6.81">they could possibly have and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1154.47" dur="5.25">tried to pass a gun bill which was shot</text>

  <text start="1164.85" dur="6.18">in the Senate and New York jumped on</text>
  <text start="1168.3" dur="6.51">this and passed their draconian gun law</text>
  <text start="1171.03" dur="7.5">very quickly we have to remember that</text>
  <text start="1174.81" dur="5.91">President Obama has already set up the</text>

  <text start="1188.31" dur="5.55">will pass them when the time is right</text>
  <text start="1190.71" dur="5.34">and that&amp;#39;s getting very very close so</text>
