  <text start="70.82" dur="5.4">that the unemployment has stayed steady</text>
  <text start="73.55" dur="3.84">nothing is going on there but you have</text>
  <text start="76.22" dur="3.98">to remember they&amp;#39;re using the same</text>
  <text start="77.39" dur="5.61">manipulated numbers at the US uses and</text>
  <text start="80.2" dur="5.199">when we look at the United States we see</text>

  <text start="85.399" dur="5.281">open and everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="87.47" dur="7.649">talking about is actually coming true</text>
  <text start="90.68" dur="8.01">and what we are seeing right now is a</text>
  <text start="95.119" dur="5.101">complete separation of what the</text>
  <text start="98.69" dur="3.15">government is telling us which is their</text>
  <text start="100.22" dur="3.17">manipulative statistical numbers like</text>
  <text start="101.84" dur="4.38">GDP inflation and everything else</text>

  <text start="106.22" dur="9.719">in right now and we talked about how</text>
  <text start="110.86" dur="7.06">students cannot find jobs when they</text>
  <text start="115.939" dur="4.891">graduate college and of course people</text>
  <text start="117.92" dur="4.14">wrote in you know it&amp;#39;s hard to believe</text>
  <text start="120.83" dur="2.37">like what do you mean they can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="122.06" dur="2.34">jobs it makes no sense they go to</text>
  <text start="123.2" dur="4.14">college they should be able to find a</text>
  <text start="124.4" dur="6.059">job but what&amp;#39;s happening is people are</text>
  <text start="127.34" dur="6.78">going to college and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="130.459" dur="5.731">get there be a or the BS and basically</text>
  <text start="134.12" dur="3.72">there&amp;#39;s really no skills behind it I me</text>
  <text start="136.19" dur="4.47">unless you&amp;#39;re becoming a lawyer a doctor</text>
  <text start="137.84" dur="3.869">and accountant and an engineer or</text>
  <text start="140.66" dur="4.01">something like that but if you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="141.709" dur="5.821">going to college with a general major</text>
  <text start="144.67" dur="4.87">it&amp;#39;s very difficult to get a job right</text>
  <text start="147.53" dur="3.51">now yes you end up if you need to take</text>
  <text start="149.54" dur="4.949">out student loans a lot of with a lot of</text>
  <text start="151.04" dur="7.05">debt but the jobs are not waiting for</text>
  <text start="154.489" dur="5.97">you and now it&amp;#39;s hitting home we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="158.09" dur="6.42">starting to hear from the corporate</text>
  <text start="160.459" dur="8.37">media that yes this is true right</text>
  <text start="164.51" dur="9.929">now there are a 6.4 million more</text>
  <text start="168.829" dur="10.47">students who have bachelor degrees who</text>
  <text start="174.439" dur="7.981">cannot find jobs there are more students</text>
  <text start="179.299" dur="7.02">graduating right now than there are jobs</text>
  <text start="182.42" dur="7.26">for these students now we&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="186.319" dur="5.101">about this quite a bit this is coming</text>
  <text start="189.68" dur="4.979">out of the bureau of labor statistics</text>
  <text start="191.42" dur="6.539">and the national center for education</text>
  <text start="194.659" dur="7.05">statistics now we&amp;#39;ve been discussing</text>
  <text start="197.959" dur="8.25">this for quite a while we knew that all</text>
  <text start="201.709" dur="6.42">of this that we&amp;#39;ve been seeing where the</text>
  <text start="206.209" dur="3.42">government is can tell everyone to go</text>
  <text start="208.129" dur="3.69">back to school go back to school take</text>
  <text start="209.629" dur="4.98">out that take out that get an education</text>
  <text start="211.819" dur="6.361">you&amp;#39;ll get a job we knew this wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="214.609" dur="8.671">true all they wanted was the debt bubble</text>
  <text start="218.18" dur="6.33">to inflate and we realize from</text>
  <text start="223.28" dur="3.9">everything else that we&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="224.51" dur="5.64">at that these students who graduate and</text>
  <text start="227.18" dur="6.179">I know many of them they cannot find the</text>
  <text start="230.15" dur="5.309">job in their majors and they have</text>
  <text start="233.359" dur="4.651">student debt the living with their</text>
  <text start="235.459" dur="5.37">parents some of them can&amp;#39;t even find</text>
  <text start="238.01" dur="4.77">part-time work right now because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="240.829" dur="3.601">afraid they&amp;#39;re going to leave as soon as</text>
  <text start="242.78" dur="3.72">a full-time job opens up so they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="244.43" dur="3.72">give them part-time work and this is why</text>
  <text start="246.5" dur="5.06">the government came out with that loan</text>
  <text start="248.15" dur="7.579">modification based on your income and</text>
  <text start="251.56" dur="8.47">now we&amp;#39;re getting hard evidence that yes</text>
  <text start="255.729" dur="6.37">this was all true and the number is</text>
  <text start="260.03" dur="4.259">growing because people don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="262.099" dur="4.44">to do and they think in their minds if I</text>
  <text start="264.289" dur="4.711">go back to school I&amp;#39;ll be I&amp;#39;ll be able</text>
  <text start="266.539" dur="6.541">to get a job and it&amp;#39;s not working out</text>
  <text start="269" dur="10.65">older ending up with is debt we see</text>
  <text start="273.08" dur="11.67">retail earnings retail sales it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="279.65" dur="8.12">much falling apart Walmart came in they</text>
  <text start="284.75" dur="8.719">slash their earning Dining&amp;#39;s we see</text>
  <text start="287.77" dur="9.43">retail sales have completely imploded</text>
  <text start="293.469" dur="5.451">retail sales disappointed even more than</text>
  <text start="297.2" dur="4.93">in October of 2014</text>
  <text start="298.92" dur="5.19">when 27 out of 27 economist at the</text>
  <text start="302.13" dur="6.62">control the control group would be</text>
  <text start="304.11" dur="8.76">positive it came in at negative point 1%</text>
  <text start="308.75" dur="7.81">retail sales excluding autos dropped by</text>
  <text start="312.87" dur="6.6">0.3% in September the second drop in a</text>
  <text start="316.56" dur="7.59">row the biggest drop since January this</text>
  <text start="319.47" dur="9.69">is the seventh month in a row that it</text>
  <text start="324.15" dur="6.84">missed year-over-year data shows</text>
  <text start="329.16" dur="4.89">sustained stagnant growth in retail</text>
  <text start="330.99" dur="6.89">sales and this is normally historically</text>
  <text start="334.05" dur="7.08">aligned with a recessionary environment</text>
  <text start="337.88" dur="6.07">so let&amp;#39;s break it down they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="341.13" dur="3.96">us that everything is fine people are</text>
  <text start="343.95" dur="3.27">going to go out there and spend their</text>
  <text start="345.09" dur="4.8">money because everyone has a job except</text>
  <text start="347.22" dur="5.52">you know the millions and millions of</text>
  <text start="349.89" dur="6.71">people they&amp;#39;re not counting electronic</text>
  <text start="352.74" dur="5.82">and appliance stores down negative 0.2%</text>
  <text start="356.6" dur="3.13">housing supposed to be improving</text>
  <text start="358.56" dur="4.35">everything supposed to be getting better</text>
  <text start="359.73" dur="5.49">well guess what building materials and</text>
  <text start="362.91" dur="5.46">supplies down negative point three</text>
  <text start="365.22" dur="5.01">percent food and beverage down negative</text>
  <text start="368.37" dur="5.46">point three percent gasoline stations</text>

  <text start="373.83" dur="5.25">merchandise stores negative 0.1%</text>
  <text start="376.61" dur="4.51">miscellaneous store retailers negative</text>
  <text start="379.08" dur="5.25">one-point-three percent online sales</text>
  <text start="381.12" dur="6.3">well that explains it everyone now is</text>
  <text start="384.33" dur="5.01">shopping online instead of the brick and</text>
  <text start="387.42" dur="4.16">mortar shops well not true because</text>
  <text start="389.34" dur="7.98">online sales negative point two percent</text>
  <text start="391.58" dur="11.32">it is not happening so far the</text>
  <text start="397.32" dur="8.87">back-to-school sales declined sales in</text>
  <text start="402.9" dur="5.28">September declined October declining</text>
  <text start="406.19" dur="4.69">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and</text>
  <text start="408.18" dur="7.44">we&amp;#39;re going into a holiday season</text>
  <text start="410.88" dur="6.06">everybody this is an indicator that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="415.62" dur="4.22">not going well and you have to remember</text>
  <text start="416.94" dur="5.28">all these people that been laid off</text>
  <text start="419.84" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re not going out and spending their</text>
  <text start="422.22" dur="6.33">money they&amp;#39;re too worried right now</text>
  <text start="424.76" dur="5.83">where am I going to get a job so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="428.55" dur="4.32">hoarding right now those people who have</text>
  <text start="430.59" dur="3.96">part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="432.87" dur="5.84">they&amp;#39;re hoarding their money right now</text>
  <text start="434.55" dur="6.66">they can&amp;#39;t go out and just spend and</text>
  <text start="438.71" dur="4.36">thank God the gas prices are lower</text>
  <text start="441.21" dur="6.02">because it makes it a little bit easier</text>
  <text start="443.07" dur="6.78">for people not to go spin and retail but</text>
  <text start="447.23" dur="3.97">they have the ability to drive places</text>
  <text start="449.85" dur="5.31">and have a little bit more fuel in their</text>
  <text start="451.2" dur="5.82">car and I believe that this was part of</text>
  <text start="455.16" dur="4.29">their agenda because they knew if they</text>
  <text start="457.02" dur="5.04">kept the prices up around three fifty</text>
  <text start="459.45" dur="6.42">four dollars a gallon businesses would</text>
  <text start="462.06" dur="7.68">collapse at this point people it would</text>
  <text start="465.87" dur="5.34">be a complete disaster and this was part</text>
  <text start="469.74" dur="2.91">of their agenda to bring this down they</text>
  <text start="471.21" dur="2.58">really thought in the beginning that</text>
  <text start="472.65" dur="3.15">they were going to go out and spend this</text>
  <text start="473.79" dur="3.75">money but now basically what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="475.8" dur="3.69">doing is just trying to keep the system</text>
  <text start="477.54" dur="5.24">alive of course the other agenda is</text>
  <text start="479.49" dur="6.27">putting a lot of pressure on Russia and</text>
  <text start="482.78" dur="6.36">the other BRIC nations that deal with</text>
  <text start="485.76" dur="8.37">oil and we see a lot of them are hurting</text>
  <text start="489.14" dur="7.63">but guess what this system is not going</text>
  <text start="494.13" dur="5.37">to make it we see the business sales</text>
  <text start="496.77" dur="3.72">they tumbled point-six percent month a</text>
  <text start="499.5" dur="4.26">month this is the biggest drop since</text>
  <text start="500.49" dur="5.97">January no inventory liquidation has</text>
  <text start="503.76" dur="5.82">started yet and this has driven the</text>
  <text start="506.46" dur="6.9">inventory to sales ratio up one point</text>
  <text start="509.58" dur="7.65">three seven times the last two times the</text>
  <text start="513.36" dur="9.54">ratio was at this level guess what the</text>
  <text start="517.23" dur="8.19">US was in a recession so we are really</text>
  <text start="522.9" dur="7.5">not in a recession right now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="525.42" dur="7.74">actually in a depression and when the</text>
  <text start="530.4" dur="5.07">market gives the signal that we are in a</text>
  <text start="533.16" dur="6.33">depression a lot of people are going to</text>
  <text start="535.47" dur="5.31">be shocked because we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="539.49" dur="4.25">this for quite a while we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="540.78" dur="6.21">watching the trend we&amp;#39;ve been preparing</text>
  <text start="543.74" dur="5.44">for what is coming and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="546.99" dur="5.22">see things accelerate now remember i</text>
  <text start="549.18" dur="6.03">talked about mortgages i talked about</text>
  <text start="552.21" dur="5.04">housing we&amp;#39;re coming out of the hot</text>
  <text start="555.21" dur="6.14">season the summer season where people</text>
  <text start="557.25" dur="9.3">usually purchase homes and back in</text>
  <text start="561.35" dur="6.489">September we saw mortgage application</text>
  <text start="566.55" dur="3.93">surg now of course they came out and</text>
  <text start="567.839" dur="5.161">they told us well you know the banking</text>
  <text start="570.48" dur="4.62">regulations for mortgages they revamp</text>
  <text start="573" dur="4.62">them making it easier for people to get</text>
  <text start="575.1" dur="5.1">mortgages and this is why we saw a surge</text>
  <text start="577.62" dur="4.74">in mortgages well that wasn&amp;#39;t true</text>
  <text start="580.2" dur="3.72">whatsoever the reason why we saw a surge</text>
  <text start="582.36" dur="2.61">was because the Fed was out there saying</text>
  <text start="583.92" dur="2.7">they were going to raise interest rates</text>
  <text start="584.97" dur="2.94">and everyone was trying to lock in</text>
  <text start="586.62" dur="4.62">before the interest rate went up and</text>
  <text start="587.91" dur="6.39">that&amp;#39;s why we saw a surge of 25% well</text>
  <text start="591.24" dur="4.589">here we are after the Fed lied to</text>
  <text start="594.3" dur="3.84">everyone and they didn&amp;#39;t go ahead and</text>
  <text start="595.829" dur="7.561">raise the interest rates because they</text>
  <text start="598.14" dur="7.4">can&amp;#39;t all of a sudden out of nowhere the</text>
  <text start="603.39" dur="7.05">mortgage applications plunged by</text>
  <text start="605.54" dur="8.049">twenty-seven percent the drop was the</text>
  <text start="610.44" dur="7.649">steepest percentage drop since the week</text>
  <text start="613.589" dur="7.111">of January 2009 when that dropped 38.8</text>
  <text start="618.089" dur="7.981">percent and that was the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="620.7" dur="8.46">I mean eleven percent away from that</text>
  <text start="626.07" dur="5.16">drop so people realized okay forget it</text>
  <text start="629.16" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re not really raising the interest</text>
  <text start="631.23" dur="5.28">rates there&amp;#39;s no reason to lock into</text>
  <text start="634.23" dur="4.14">anything and most of the people right</text>
  <text start="636.51" dur="5.819">now and I&amp;#39;m sure a lot of that was</text>
  <text start="638.37" dur="5.969">completely just out of fear and they</text>
  <text start="642.329" dur="5.311">just completely dropped it and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="644.339" dur="6.901">seeing right now that as we move into</text>
  <text start="647.64" dur="5.34">this winter what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="651.24" dur="3.18">the housing market is going to fall</text>
  <text start="652.98" dur="4.109">apart now the corporate media is out</text>
  <text start="654.42" dur="5.22">there and they&amp;#39;re spinning it the</text>
  <text start="657.089" dur="5.19">opposite way they&amp;#39;re saying the reason</text>
  <text start="659.64" dur="5.22">why we had the plunge was because of the</text>
  <text start="662.279" dur="5.071">new mortgage regulations it&amp;#39;s making it</text>
  <text start="664.86" dur="4.32">much more difficult for the banks they</text>
  <text start="667.35" dur="3.989">have to adjust and this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="669.18" dur="4.92">seeing the plunge it&amp;#39;s funny when the</text>
  <text start="671.339" dur="5.331">mortgage application surged they said</text>
  <text start="674.1" dur="5.549">because it was the better mortgage</text>
  <text start="676.67" dur="4.84">regulations and all they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="679.649" dur="4.201">spinning the same news all different</text>
  <text start="681.51" dur="4.68">ways to fit their story so the real</text>
  <text start="683.85" dur="3.479">reason is because people got scared they</text>
  <text start="686.19" dur="4.2">thought the rates were going to go up</text>
  <text start="687.329" dur="5.611">they didn&amp;#39;t and now we see the real</text>
  <text start="690.39" dur="4.74">effect and next month it will get worse</text>
  <text start="692.94" dur="5.009">and it will get worse after that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="695.13" dur="4.54">seeing houses on the market much much</text>
  <text start="697.949" dur="4.301">longer they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="699.67" dur="6.12">move them yes in certain areas we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="702.25" dur="6.48">still seeing positive growth we saw this</text>
  <text start="705.79" dur="5.19">back in 2007 going to 2008 it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="708.73" dur="4.26">hit everywhere all at the same time I</text>
