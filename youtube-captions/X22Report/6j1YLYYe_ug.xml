  <text start="49.92" dur="4.74">in italy and we are seeing the same</text>
  <text start="52.079" dur="5.431">things in every single country right now</text>
  <text start="54.66" dur="4.35">they had to revise some numbers they had</text>
  <text start="57.51" dur="3.029">to let us know that you know things</text>
  <text start="59.01" dur="3.209">aren&amp;#39;t as good as they said they were</text>
  <text start="60.539" dur="3.571">going to be you know because of all that</text>
  <text start="62.219" dur="4.651">propaganda during the summer months</text>
  <text start="64.11" dur="5.76">where they told us that you know Italy</text>
  <text start="66.87" dur="6.179">Spain the whole eurozone unemployment&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="69.87" dur="5.1">decreasing from 12.1 percent to twelve</text>
  <text start="73.049" dur="4.201">percent they&amp;#39;re coming out of the</text>

  <text start="77.25" dur="6.57">fake the unemployment actually increased</text>
  <text start="79.979" dur="6.691">from 12.12 12.2 and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="83.82" dur="8.15">now is that Italy had to revise some</text>
  <text start="86.67" dur="9.059">numbers and they&amp;#39;re expecting that the</text>
  <text start="91.97" dur="6.28">GDP will contract by one point eight</text>
  <text start="95.729" dur="5.67">percent where they thought it was only</text>
  <text start="98.25" dur="5.759">cone to contract by one point seven so</text>
  <text start="101.399" dur="6">we can see already things are not going</text>
  <text start="104.009" dur="6.061">well and if we look at if we look at</text>
  <text start="107.399" dur="5.461">something else here and we look at Italy</text>
  <text start="110.07" dur="5.969">with their new car registration we are</text>
  <text start="112.86" dur="6.27">seeing that car registration is is down</text>
  <text start="116.039" dur="6">a lot I mean if we look back at the</text>
  <text start="119.13" dur="5.97">height back in two thousand eight they</text>
  <text start="122.039" dur="7.431">were close to 200,000 car registrations</text>
  <text start="125.1" dur="7.79">now that number is cut in half about</text>
  <text start="129.47" dur="7.42">100,000 for this year for last year</text>
  <text start="132.89" dur="6.34">alone here and it&amp;#39;s decreasing this year</text>
  <text start="136.89" dur="3.36">so what does that tell you that tells</text>
  <text start="139.23" dur="4.56">you that</text>
  <text start="140.25" dur="6.09">they have high unemployment people if</text>
  <text start="143.79" dur="4.05">they have a job they&amp;#39;re not making as</text>
  <text start="146.34" dur="3.57">much as they did and their money&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="147.84" dur="3.84">going as far and right now people are</text>
  <text start="149.91" dur="5.16">holding on to their cars and not buying</text>
  <text start="151.68" dur="6.15">new ones and or they&amp;#39;re getting rid of</text>
  <text start="155.07" dur="5.94">their cars and they are walking or</text>
  <text start="157.83" dur="5.43">biking or taking mass transit to work to</text>
  <text start="161.01" dur="7.17">save money so we can see what is</text>
  <text start="163.26" dur="8.1">happening here in Europe now here in the</text>
  <text start="168.18" dur="6.48">US we see other things happening now we</text>
  <text start="171.36" dur="6.21">see Kellogg&amp;#39;s is going to cut seven</text>
  <text start="174.66" dur="4.74">percent of its jobs and they have</text>
  <text start="177.57" dur="4.56">roughly around thirty one thousand</text>
  <text start="179.4" dur="5.46">employees so that&amp;#39;s roughly about 2,100</text>
  <text start="182.13" dur="5.16">people and we see this happening all</text>
  <text start="184.86" dur="5.67">over the place they keep telling us that</text>
  <text start="187.29" dur="6.9">unemployment is going down it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="190.53" dur="7.92">better why are these major corporations</text>
  <text start="194.19" dur="6.45">laying off so many people it makes no</text>
  <text start="198.45" dur="4.56">sense now they&amp;#39;re also talking that this</text>
  <text start="200.64" dur="5.55">holiday season is not going to be as</text>
  <text start="203.01" dur="6.35">good as it was last year well forgive me</text>
  <text start="206.19" dur="6.95">but last year was an unemployment higher</text>
  <text start="209.36" dur="6.97">now if unemployment has come down</text>
  <text start="213.14" dur="6.25">wouldn&amp;#39;t you think that the Christmas</text>
  <text start="216.33" dur="5.79">season would be better ah but when you</text>
  <text start="219.39" dur="5.37">manipulate the numbers certain things</text>
  <text start="222.12" dur="4.92">don&amp;#39;t make sense you would also think</text>
  <text start="224.76" dur="6.18">that retail sales were getting better</text>
  <text start="227.04" dur="6.39">but as i reported retail sales always</text>
  <text start="230.94" dur="5.67">declining they have been declining this</text>
  <text start="233.43" dur="7.619">entire year and what else do we know</text>
  <text start="236.61" dur="7.469">well we also know that real estate is</text>
  <text start="241.049" dur="5.551">not doing as well as they&amp;#39;re saying now</text>
  <text start="244.079" dur="4.561">again if unemployment is coming down to</text>
  <text start="246.6" dur="3.57">keep you know it was at eight percent I</text>
  <text start="248.64" dur="3.12">mean if we look at last year was ordered</text>
  <text start="250.17" dur="4.5">eight-point-five percent now we&amp;#39;re down</text>
  <text start="251.76" dur="5.61">to seven point two percent now common</text>
  <text start="254.67" dur="4.409">sense would say wow that that&amp;#39;s much</text>
  <text start="257.37" dur="3.989">much better i mean the unemployment is</text>
  <text start="259.079" dur="4.531">coming down more people have work people</text>
  <text start="261.359" dur="3.481">are going to go out and buy cars they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="263.61" dur="4.41">going to go out and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="264.84" dur="5.759">purchase more things in the stores and</text>
  <text start="268.02" dur="5.579">they&amp;#39;re going to go buy a house because</text>
  <text start="270.599" dur="3.391">the the youth are now getting jobs and</text>
  <text start="273.599" dur="2.911">things</text>
  <text start="273.99" dur="6.69">getting better but what are we actually</text>
  <text start="276.51" dur="7.77">seeing well in my last reports we learn</text>
  <text start="280.68" dur="5.61">that GM is channel stuff in which all</text>
  <text start="284.28" dur="3.99">that means is they&amp;#39;re giving all their</text>
  <text start="286.29" dur="3.57">inventory to the dealerships to hold on</text>
  <text start="288.27" dur="5.28">to it so it looks like they got rid of</text>
  <text start="289.86" dur="6.87">it we see retail stores closing and we</text>
  <text start="293.55" dur="6.63">see mortgage applications and pending</text>
  <text start="296.73" dur="10.83">sales decreasing for the housing market</text>
  <text start="300.18" dur="11.4">now depending sales right now fell 21.1</text>
  <text start="307.56" dur="5.88">percent in September now wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="311.58" dur="4.98">President Obama just out there telling</text>
  <text start="313.44" dur="5.01">us that real estate is making a rebound</text>
  <text start="316.56" dur="4.95">and everything is going well and things</text>
  <text start="318.45" dur="4.32">are happening and we can see that you</text>
  <text start="321.51" dur="3">know since the real estate markets</text>
  <text start="322.77" dur="4.2">picking up everything else is going to</text>
  <text start="324.51" dur="4.8">be doing better and what we&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="326.97" dur="6.54">seeing is the opposite mortgage</text>
  <text start="329.31" dur="8.55">applications declining pending sales now</text>
  <text start="333.51" dur="9.77">declining foot traffic where there&amp;#39;s new</text>
  <text start="337.86" dur="9.36">home builders declining major furniture</text>
  <text start="343.28" dur="7.93">manufacturers going out of business the</text>
  <text start="347.22" dur="6.78">Fed is still purchasing 45 billion</text>
  <text start="351.21" dur="4.62">dollars worth of toxic real estate from</text>
  <text start="354" dur="4.32">the banks and they&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="355.83" dur="4.41">increase the amount of quantitative</text>
  <text start="358.32" dur="4.59">easing and don&amp;#39;t forget they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="360.24" dur="5.43">still purchasing the 40 billion dollars</text>
  <text start="362.91" dur="6.21">for Treasury bonds and they would like</text>
  <text start="365.67" dur="5.1">to increase that also because most of</text>
  <text start="369.12" dur="5.73">the foreign nations are starting to</text>
  <text start="370.77" dur="6.77">realize that the US dollar is losing</text>
  <text start="374.85" dur="4.98">ground and it is about to implode</text>
  <text start="377.54" dur="4.51">collapse whatever you want to call it</text>
  <text start="379.83" dur="4.29">and they realize they&amp;#39;re holding on to</text>
  <text start="382.05" dur="3.15">all this all you know they&amp;#39;re holding on</text>
  <text start="384.12" dur="3.27">the dollars and they&amp;#39;re holding on the</text>
  <text start="385.2" dur="4.62">Treasury bonds and they don&amp;#39;t want it</text>
  <text start="387.39" dur="4.17">that&amp;#39;s why Saudi Arabia a lot of the</text>
  <text start="389.82" dur="4.56">Middle Eastern countries are starting to</text>
  <text start="391.56" dur="6">make deals with China that&amp;#39;s why China</text>
  <text start="394.38" dur="5.46">is going around and making a deal with</text>
  <text start="397.56" dur="8.85">Kenya to be the clearinghouse for China</text>
  <text start="399.84" dur="7.62">they also did a swap with UK which</text>
  <text start="406.41" dur="4.05">bypass the</text>
  <text start="407.46" dur="8.22">so we see many things happening here all</text>
  <text start="410.46" dur="9.09">at once okay what else is going on here</text>
  <text start="415.68" dur="7.44">well it just came out and as we know</text>

  <text start="429.96" dur="4.41">reading the email i&amp;#39;m getting so many</text>
  <text start="431.699" dur="5.461">now at this time it&amp;#39;s taking me a lot</text>
  <text start="434.37" dur="4.35">longer to answer and if i just spent all</text>
  <text start="437.16" dur="3.479">day answering all the emails i wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="438.72" dur="4.8">have time to do anything else so i&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="787.15" dur="8.1">happening here there are major major</text>
  <text start="789.76" dur="8.07">problems it&amp;#39;s almost like in 2007 where</text>
  <text start="795.25" dur="5.01">most of everyone who wasn&amp;#39;t paying</text>
  <text start="797.83" dur="5.3">attention was going about their day</text>
  <text start="800.26" dur="5.46">thinking everything was fine you know</text>
  <text start="803.13" dur="6.999">Bernanke was out there telling us that</text>
  <text start="805.72" dur="7.65">the Fed contain the sub prime real</text>
  <text start="810.129" dur="5.7">estate is strong they do not forecasting</text>

  <text start="815.829" dur="4.591">this is the same year that everything</text>
  <text start="817.36" dur="4.529">just fell apart so we are definitely see</text>
  <text start="820.42" dur="3.93">something we are seeing something</text>
  <text start="821.889" dur="4.8">happening we&amp;#39;re seeing major layoffs</text>

  <text start="829.089" dur="5.641">mortgage area of the financial industry</text>
  <text start="831.129" dur="6.931">and we are seeing so many things we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="834.73" dur="5.969">seeing retail stores closing laying off</text>
  <text start="838.06" dur="5.759">people they&amp;#39;re telling us that the</text>
  <text start="840.699" dur="5.551">holiday season is not going well and it</text>
  <text start="843.819" dur="7.26">will not go well so we can see that</text>
  <text start="846.25" dur="6.54">things are absolutely falling apart now</text>
  <text start="851.079" dur="5.971">in my other reports I did mention</text>
  <text start="852.79" dur="7.229">something about balance but recently you</text>
  <text start="857.05" dur="6.719">expect US banks are presenting to the</text>
  <text start="860.019" dur="8.43">Federal Reserve their bail and plan and</text>
  <text start="863.769" dur="8.25">it shows how they&amp;#39;re going to work</text>
  <text start="868.449" dur="5.791">through a major collapse of the banking</text>
  <text start="872.019" dur="4.92">system and how they&amp;#39;re going to fund</text>
  <text start="874.24" dur="7.74">their banks so they don&amp;#39;t implode on</text>
  <text start="876.939" dur="7.71">themselves so what do we know well we</text>
  <text start="881.98" dur="6.74">know there was a private meeting with</text>
  <text start="884.649" dur="8.101">Wells Fargo Bank of America Citigroup</text>
  <text start="888.72" dur="7.39">chase and other banks with the Fed to go</text>
  <text start="892.75" dur="5.279">over their plan for balance and we</text>
  <text start="896.11" dur="7.07">understand that FDIC Bank of England</text>
  <text start="898.029" dur="8.821">document was the first document the</text>
  <text start="903.18" dur="6.55">whole entire Bible of how the balance</text>
  <text start="906.85" dur="9">are going to work that document came out</text>
  <text start="909.73" dur="9.75">in December 12 the Cyprus test was in</text>
  <text start="915.85" dur="6.06">February March of 2013 so the document</text>
  <text start="919.48" dur="5.219">was already created before the Cyprus</text>
  <text start="921.91" dur="5.94">incident and as everyone believes that</text>
  <text start="924.699" dur="5.37">this was the template of what is going</text>
  <text start="927.85" dur="4.349">to happen and those people who still</text>
  <text start="930.069" dur="5.841">have money in the banks who think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="932.199" dur="7.231">safe it&amp;#39;s insured and everything is fine</text>
  <text start="935.91" dur="6.69">will be surprised why</text>
  <text start="939.43" dur="8.06">and this occurs when all of a sudden an</text>
  <text start="942.6" dur="7.12">event occurs the banks are closed down</text>
  <text start="947.49" dur="3.46">just like in Cyprus you know could</text>
  <text start="949.72" dur="4.02">happen on a friday which it usually</text>
  <text start="950.95" dur="4.59">happens they tell you oh we&amp;#39;re closing</text>
  <text start="953.74" dur="4.5">down you know just for maintenance or</text>
  <text start="955.54" dur="4.95">something will reopen on Monday you go</text>
  <text start="958.24" dur="4.2">to sleep on Friday over the weekend you</text>
  <text start="960.49" dur="4.86">don&amp;#39;t really think about it monday comes</text>
  <text start="962.44" dur="4.8">the banks are still closed and you start</text>
  <text start="965.35" dur="4.17">to wonder what is going on and they make</text>
  <text start="967.24" dur="4.5">an announcement oh because of what has</text>
  <text start="969.52" dur="6.27">happened from this event we cannot keep</text>
  <text start="971.74" dur="5.88">the banks open we need to freeze</text>
  <text start="975.79" dur="4.59">accounts right now because under the</text>
  <text start="977.62" dur="4.44">dodd-frank act we cannot get bailouts</text>
  <text start="980.38" dur="4.5">from the government so what we need to</text>
  <text start="982.06" dur="6.69">do is we need to go into all of your</text>
  <text start="984.88" dur="7.47">accounts put a freeze on them take what</text>
  <text start="988.75" dur="5.82">we need to get the bank&amp;#39;s out of trouble</text>
  <text start="992.35" dur="4.26">what we&amp;#39;ll do is we&amp;#39;ll replace it with</text>
  <text start="994.57" dur="4.68">bank stock will put it into your account</text>
  <text start="996.61" dur="4.56">and at a later time we&amp;#39;ll refund this</text>
  <text start="999.25" dur="3.6">money maybe you know depending on what</text>
  <text start="1001.17" dur="4.44">the bank stock is worth and of course</text>
  <text start="1002.85" dur="4.739">you&amp;#39;re receiving bank stock from a bank</text>
  <text start="1005.61" dur="5.13">that is collapsing so that makes sense</text>
  <text start="1007.589" dur="4.471">and just like in Cyprus they told you oh</text>
  <text start="1010.74" dur="3.18">don&amp;#39;t worry we&amp;#39;re all I&amp;#39;m going to take</text>
  <text start="1012.06" dur="4.35">eight protect to eight to ten percent</text>
  <text start="1013.92" dur="4.44">off of your account and the rest will</text>
  <text start="1016.41" dur="3.78">just keep frozen there and what happened</text>
  <text start="1018.36" dur="3.51">in Cyprus they didn&amp;#39;t take eight or ten</text>
  <text start="1020.19" dur="3.72">percent they took forty seven percent of</text>
  <text start="1021.87" dur="3.75">the people&amp;#39;s money and they kept the</text>
  <text start="1023.91" dur="3.63">other money frozen and it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="1025.62" dur="3.9">over it&amp;#39;s going to be about a year</text>
  <text start="1027.54" dur="4.68">before they can even take out their</text>
  <text start="1029.52" dur="6.569">money and this is what we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1032.22" dur="5.79">see now what did they do already so</text>
  <text start="1036.089" dur="3.781">people cannot transfer the money out of</text>
  <text start="1038.01" dur="4.23">the country well they already</text>
  <text start="1039.87" dur="6.42">implemented capital controls within the</text>
  <text start="1042.24" dur="6.24">US with Chase nhpc and other banks are</text>
  <text start="1046.29" dur="3.93">eventually going to do this I mean</text>
  <text start="1048.48" dur="3.75">there&amp;#39;s no doubt in my mind that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1050.22" dur="4.86">going to follow suit with the other</text>
  <text start="1052.23" dur="5.73">banks that they aren&amp;#39;t allowing people</text>
  <text start="1055.08" dur="5.82">to transfer transfer money out of the</text>
  <text start="1057.96" dur="4.92">states and pretty soon when the fact the</text>
  <text start="1060.9" dur="6.36">law comes into effect and this will be</text>
  <text start="1062.88" dur="8.07">July 2014 you will not be able to open</text>
  <text start="1067.26" dur="6.42">up an account outside of the US</text>
  <text start="1070.95" dur="4.8">so what are we seeing here well we are</text>
  <text start="1073.68" dur="6.12">seeing that they are laying the</text>
  <text start="1075.75" dur="6.45">groundwork for these balance that is</text>
  <text start="1079.8" dur="4.59">what we are seeing and for those people</text>
  <text start="1082.2" dur="3.9">who still have money in the bank I would</text>
  <text start="1084.39" dur="4.23">start thinking twice I mean this is my</text>
  <text start="1086.1" dur="4.5">opinion but i would start taking it out</text>
  <text start="1088.62" dur="4.74">only keep the amount that you need in</text>
  <text start="1090.6" dur="5.25">the bank to pay your bills and the rest</text>
  <text start="1093.36" dur="4.98">i would put someplace else you know</text>
  <text start="1095.85" dur="5.01">invest in gold and silver keep some cash</text>
  <text start="1098.34" dur="5.07">do whatever you have to do but you do</text>
  <text start="1100.86" dur="5.13">not want to wake up on that early</text>
  <text start="1103.41" dur="5.73">morning to realize that all your money</text>
  <text start="1105.99" dur="5.55">is gone it is frozen and all you have is</text>
  <text start="1109.14" dur="4.26">worthless bank stock and that is that</text>
  <text start="1111.54" dur="8.25">exactly what happened to the people in</text>
  <text start="1113.4" dur="9.09">cyprus now we do understand that the LA</text>
  <text start="1119.79" dur="6.09">Airport shooting was a complete false</text>
  <text start="1122.49" dur="6.51">flag event and this was to push the</text>
  <text start="1125.88" dur="6.24">agenda of the government and in many</text>
  <text start="1129" dur="7.44">different aspects one they really want</text>
  <text start="1132.12" dur="8.52">to arm the TSA so of course they are</text>
  <text start="1136.44" dur="7.05">using this false flag event to say that</text>
  <text start="1140.64" dur="7.11">all checkpoints and TSA agents need to</text>
  <text start="1143.49" dur="7.92">be armed at this time we also see that</text>
  <text start="1147.75" dur="6.75">this individual had antigovernment</text>
  <text start="1151.41" dur="5.25">conspiracy theory something about New</text>
  <text start="1154.5" dur="3.84">World Order and you can see what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1156.66" dur="3.54">doing at this point they&amp;#39;re painting a</text>
  <text start="1158.34" dur="4.16">picture of anyone that is</text>
  <text start="1160.2" dur="5.85">anti-government who is a conspiracy</text>
  <text start="1162.5" dur="5.8">conspiracy theorist who believes in the</text>
  <text start="1166.05" dur="5.07">New World Order these people are</text>
  <text start="1168.3" dur="5.91">dangerous and they will act out with a</text>
  <text start="1171.12" dur="5.28">weapon and kill people so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1174.21" dur="5.13">lumping the people in a certain group</text>
  <text start="1176.4" dur="5.97">right now and we also know that this</text>
  <text start="1179.34" dur="5.07">person used an assault rifle so in the</text>
  <text start="1182.37" dur="4.89">state of California which is Dianne</text>
  <text start="1184.41" dur="5.55">Feinstein state and we understand they</text>
  <text start="1187.26" dur="4.53">have the gun bill and the UN arms treaty</text>
  <text start="1189.96" dur="4.98">pending in the Senate and we also</text>
  <text start="1191.79" dur="5.64">understand that John Kerry also hear you</text>
  <text start="1194.94" dur="4.2">already signed the UN arms treaty and</text>
  <text start="1197.43" dur="3.33">it&amp;#39;s just pending there waiting and we</text>
  <text start="1199.14" dur="4.35">understand that the Senate will not</text>
  <text start="1200.76" dur="3.84">ratify the UN arms treaty so what do</text>
  <text start="1203.49" dur="4.29">they need to do</text>
  <text start="1204.6" dur="5.85">they need to push this agenda forward so</text>
  <text start="1207.78" dur="7.11">the Senators and the people up in</text>
  <text start="1210.45" dur="6.93">Washington and the people in the US see</text>
  <text start="1214.89" dur="4.8">that we need to have these laws on the</text>
  <text start="1217.38" dur="4.28">books to protect ourselves from these</text>
  <text start="1219.69" dur="4.98">crazy antigovernment conspiracy</text>
  <text start="1221.66" dur="6.67">theorists who carry assault rifles in</text>
  <text start="1224.67" dur="5.22">states with very strong gun laws so we</text>
  <text start="1228.33" dur="4.08">can see the direction that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1229.89" dur="4.98">heading in now will they be able to push</text>
  <text start="1232.41" dur="5.79">the gun laws with this episode with this</text>
  <text start="1234.87" dur="5.07">false flag most likely not i mean dianne</text>
  <text start="1238.2" dur="3.72">feinstein was out there saying that</text>
  <text start="1239.94" dur="3.06">she&amp;#39;s going to try to push it but she</text>
  <text start="1241.92" dur="3.75">doesn&amp;#39;t believe it&amp;#39;s going to go</text>
  <text start="1243" dur="4.29">anywhere so let&amp;#39;s take this a step</text>
  <text start="1245.67" dur="6.32">further so now what do they have to do</text>
  <text start="1247.29" dur="9.21">we all know they need to create a</text>
  <text start="1251.99" dur="7.39">horrific major false flag that really</text>
  <text start="1256.5" dur="7.14">really hits home that wakes the american</text>
  <text start="1259.38" dur="6.6">people up to demand to beg for the UN</text>
  <text start="1263.64" dur="5.25">arms treaty and the gun bill they will</text>
  <text start="1265.98" dur="5.1">demand please do something we need</text>
  <text start="1268.89" dur="4.29">something and of course the president</text>
  <text start="1271.08" dur="4.26">the Senate will be out there know you</text>
  <text start="1273.18" dur="3.66">know something it just so happens we</text>
  <text start="1275.34" dur="3.9">have the gun bill and the own arms</text>
  <text start="1276.84" dur="4.59">treaty sitting here waiting let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1279.24" dur="4.59">vote for this right now and this is what</text>
  <text start="1281.43" dur="5.13">they will do because this is their</text>
  <text start="1283.83" dur="6.24">agenda this is what they are planning</text>
  <text start="1286.56" dur="8.15">and I read to you in my other report I</text>
  <text start="1290.07" dur="7.35">think it was report number 20 for and</text>
  <text start="1294.71" dur="5.61">203 if you want to read that of why they</text>
  <text start="1297.42" dur="8.07">need to disarm the American people and</text>
  <text start="1300.32" dur="7.84">right now the head of TSA is he wants to</text>
  <text start="1305.49" dur="4.77">arm the TSA officers now because of the</text>
  <text start="1308.16" dur="8.49">events that just took place and he&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="1310.26" dur="8.52">pushing for that now I also talked a lot</text>
  <text start="1316.65" dur="4.7">about the internet and how the</text>
  <text start="1318.78" dur="4.92">government wants to control it and on</text>
  <text start="1321.35" dur="5.65">Saturday I talked about that there are</text>
  <text start="1323.7" dur="5.64">ten corporations that really control</text>
  <text start="1327" dur="5.94">what you purchase and what you do and</text>
  <text start="1329.34" dur="7.59">there are like six media corporations</text>
  <text start="1332.94" dur="5.489">that control what you hear now they are</text>
  <text start="1336.93" dur="4.709">trying a back door</text>
  <text start="1338.429" dur="6.301">approach to control the internet and</text>
  <text start="1341.639" dur="8.221">this is very interesting what they want</text>
  <text start="1344.73" dur="10.86">to do is they an AT&amp;amp;T Verizon these</text>
  <text start="1349.86" dur="10.08">companies they want major corporations</text>
  <text start="1355.59" dur="11.12">that own websites to pay them lots of</text>
  <text start="1359.94" dur="10.92">money and give them the internet speeds</text>
  <text start="1366.71" dur="6.309">everyone else like my site would not get</text>
  <text start="1370.86" dur="5.1">the fast speeds that will get the slow</text>
  <text start="1373.019" dur="6">speeds so it&amp;#39;s almost like you going</text>
  <text start="1375.96" dur="6.299">across a bridge the people who pay the</text>
  <text start="1379.019" dur="5.701">most for the toll get to go in the fast</text>
  <text start="1382.259" dur="5.55">lane the people who pay a little less</text>
  <text start="1384.72" dur="5.64">get to go in the traffic e slow lane and</text>
  <text start="1387.809" dur="5.25">the people who pay even less than that</text>
  <text start="1390.36" dur="5.789">or nothing don&amp;#39;t even get to cross the</text>
  <text start="1393.059" dur="6.301">bridge this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="1396.149" dur="6.181">now and they want the major companies to</text>
  <text start="1399.36" dur="6">pay quite a bit of money to have fast</text>
  <text start="1402.33" dur="4.26">speeds and everyone else to have slow</text>
  <text start="1405.36" dur="2.819">speeds and you say to yourself well</text>
  <text start="1406.59" dur="4.65">what&amp;#39;s the big deal it&amp;#39;s a little bit</text>
  <text start="1408.179" dur="6.21">slower but what happens is most of the</text>
  <text start="1411.24" dur="6.029">time when you do a search it&amp;#39;s equal</text>

  <text start="1754.89" dur="8.97">back to December 19 2003 the Libyan</text>
  <text start="1760.59" dur="5.37">President Qaddafi stunned much of the</text>
  <text start="1763.86" dur="4.65">world by renouncing Tripoli&amp;#39;s weapons of</text>

  <text start="1794.94" dur="7.83">essentially been cut off in 1981 now</text>
  <text start="1798.38" dur="6.81">this should be a lesson because this is</text>
  <text start="1802.77" dur="4.95">what&amp;#39;s happening in Syria so although</text>
  <text start="1805.19" dur="4.03">Syria met its deadline by destroying</text>

  <text start="1823.83" dur="10.579">remain in power what did we see in Libya</text>
  <text start="1829.58" dur="7.54">why if Qaddafi was agreeing to</text>
  <text start="1834.409" dur="6.481">relinquishing his weapons of mass</text>
  <text start="1837.12" dur="6.45">destruction and going along with the</text>
  <text start="1840.89" dur="4.75">inspectors and handing everything over</text>
  <text start="1843.57" dur="4.32">and they inspected the whole country</text>
  <text start="1845.64" dur="4.68">well you have to remember he was selling</text>
  <text start="1847.89" dur="7.55">his oil not using the US dollar so</text>
  <text start="1850.32" dur="8.19">eventually the u.s. invaded Syria is</text>
  <text start="1855.44" dur="6.16">still selling its oil and same thing</text>
  <text start="1858.51" dur="6.06">with Iran selling its oil not using the</text>

  <text start="1869.07" dur="7.319">central bankers will be going in</text>
  <text start="1872.519" dur="7.98">to Syria and Iran you can count on it</text>
  <text start="1876.389" dur="7.29">and this goes on to say word is on the</text>

  <text start="1939.089" dur="3.84">have much time and they should have done</text>
  <text start="1941.309" dur="4.381">this years ago because we all know</text>

  <text start="1949.499" dur="6.451">developed a nuclear weapon and they</text>
  <text start="1951.899" dur="7.32">should really go in and bomb Iran at</text>
  <text start="1955.95" dur="5.519">this time so they are continuing they</text>
  <text start="1959.219" dur="4.95">there are continuing with the propaganda</text>
  <text start="1961.469" dur="4.59">and they will continue with this and we</text>
  <text start="1964.169" dur="5.97">will definitely see something occur and</text>
  <text start="1966.059" dur="6.511">we have to remember that anything that</text>
  <text start="1970.139" dur="4.44">happens over there the American people</text>
  <text start="1972.57" dur="6.419">in Congress are really not going to give</text>
  <text start="1974.579" dur="8.7">any any thought to so something needs to</text>

  <text start="1983.279" dur="5.73">people of the United States and the</text>
  <text start="1986.07" dur="5.759">people in Congress to really react to</text>
  <text start="1989.009" dur="5.61">something so you can almost bet on that</text>
  <text start="1991.829" dur="6">some type of false flag or some type of</text>
  <text start="1994.619" dur="6.21">an event will happen here in the US it</text>
  <text start="1997.829" dur="5.18">will probably be a multi-prong event</text>
  <text start="2000.829" dur="4.521">where will consist of cyber attack</text>
  <text start="2003.009" dur="4.471">biological chemical new</text>
  <text start="2005.35" dur="4.8">clear and it will happen all across the</text>

  <text start="2019.09" dur="6.24">sudden we are at war okay now we do</text>
  <text start="2023.35" dur="4.74">understand and there was another glitch</text>
  <text start="2025.33" dur="5.28">in the NASDAQ and we&amp;#39;re seeing many many</text>
  <text start="2028.09" dur="6.24">of these glitches and I believe this is</text>
  <text start="2030.61" dur="5.6">all getting ready for the cyber attack</text>
  <text start="2034.33" dur="4.05">to take place we&amp;#39;ve seen other glitches</text>
  <text start="2036.21" dur="6.42">throughout the internet with major</text>
  <text start="2038.38" dur="7.77">corporations and it seems like they are</text>
  <text start="2042.63" dur="6.279">testing implanting and doing things</text>
  <text start="2046.15" dur="5.459">because these glitches just occurred I</text>
  <text start="2048.909" dur="7.441">mean they just a couple months back they</text>
  <text start="2051.609" dur="7.05">started and it&amp;#39;s been fine previous to</text>
  <text start="2056.35" dur="6.84">this so something is definitely</text>
  <text start="2058.659" dur="8.22">happening now we see that Anonymous is</text>
  <text start="2063.19" dur="5.79">planning a a million mask march across</text>

  <text start="2081.639" dur="4.921">could be a potential false flag</text>
  <text start="2082.96" dur="6.03">something might occur or as most of</text>
  <text start="2086.56" dur="4.14">these things go nothing might even</text>
  <text start="2088.99" dur="4.59">happen maybe even people won&amp;#39;t even show</text>
  <text start="2090.7" dur="5.58">up I don&amp;#39;t know but we just have to look</text>
  <text start="2093.58" dur="8.58">at that and we also see in north central</text>
  <text start="2096.28" dur="9.839">Texas there is a exercise from urban</text>

  <text start="2124.15" dur="4.68">something happens and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="2125.8" dur="5.04">just like in the LA shooting we saw a</text>
