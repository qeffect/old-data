  <text start="44.92" dur="6.029">point to a collapse let&amp;#39;s get right into</text>
  <text start="48.1" dur="5.43">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="50.949" dur="6.32">here we are coming to the end of March</text>
  <text start="53.53" dur="7.559">and when we look back to january to now</text>
  <text start="57.269" dur="5.531">we see the economy and i&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="61.089" dur="3.091">the real economic indicators not the</text>
  <text start="62.8" dur="3.12">manipulative statistical numbers that</text>
  <text start="64.18" dur="3.06">the government throws at us i&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="65.92" dur="2.85">talking about the stock market that</text>
  <text start="67.24" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re completely manipulated I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="68.77" dur="5.73">talking about what&amp;#39;s really going on</text>
  <text start="71.41" dur="5.519">here in the US now of course we know the</text>
  <text start="74.5" dur="5.009">US government central bankers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="76.929" dur="3.871">not going to tell us the truth they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="79.509" dur="2.821">not going to tell us oh we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="80.8" dur="3.81">recession we&amp;#39;re in a depression we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="82.33" dur="5.88">collapsing actually they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="84.61" dur="5.88">say anything until it&amp;#39;s too late but we</text>
  <text start="88.21" dur="4.92">notice from everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="90.49" dur="5.129">looking at is that things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="93.13" dur="5.129">falling apart and there&amp;#39;s no way really</text>
  <text start="95.619" dur="5.67">for the central bank to stop it yes they</text>
  <text start="98.259" dur="4.59">can manipulate certain statistical</text>
  <text start="101.289" dur="4.351">information they can manipulate the</text>
  <text start="102.849" dur="4.981">stock market but it&amp;#39;s getting more and</text>
  <text start="105.64" dur="4.589">more difficult as time goes on and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="107.83" dur="6.149">starting to notice this and if we notice</text>
  <text start="110.229" dur="7.291">here in the US the number of working-age</text>
  <text start="113.979" dur="7.65">Americans that are officially unemployed</text>
  <text start="117.52" dur="7.65">is around 8.2 million and if we add that</text>
  <text start="121.629" dur="5.421">number of working-age Americans that are</text>
  <text start="125.17" dur="3.959">considered to be not in the labor force</text>
  <text start="127.05" dur="4.57">well that number is about ninety four</text>
  <text start="129.129" dur="4.141">point three million and when you add</text>
  <text start="131.62" dur="4.979">those two numbers together we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="133.27" dur="5.549">at a hundred and 2.5 million people who</text>
  <text start="136.599" dur="6.421">want to work who want a job right now</text>
  <text start="138.819" dur="8.67">and when you look at only Americans that</text>
  <text start="143.02" dur="8.16">are aged from 25 to 54 we see 23.2</text>
  <text start="147.489" dur="5.851">percent of them are unemployed and the</text>
  <text start="151.18" dur="5.27">inactivity rate for men in their prime</text>
  <text start="153.34" dur="6.6">working years it really has exploded</text>
  <text start="156.45" dur="5.32">higher during the last recession and</text>
  <text start="159.94" dur="4.14">guess what it</text>
  <text start="161.77" dur="5.78">didn&amp;#39;t go down since the last recession</text>
  <text start="164.08" dur="6.09">actually it continued to go up even</text>
  <text start="167.55" dur="4.45">after they told us that we are</text>
  <text start="170.17" dur="4.17">completely recovered and unemployment is</text>
  <text start="172" dur="5.82">at four point nine percent and right now</text>
  <text start="174.34" dur="7.71">it is hovering at near all-time highs</text>
  <text start="177.82" dur="6.6">and the inactivity rate for ages 25 to</text>
  <text start="182.05" dur="6.93">54 if we look back and we go back in</text>
  <text start="184.42" dur="9.38">time back to 2008 we were around nine</text>
  <text start="188.98" dur="7.58">point two percent well since that time</text>
  <text start="193.8" dur="8.86">where we had the Great Recession to now</text>
  <text start="196.56" dur="9.82">we are at eleven point six percent for</text>
  <text start="202.66" dur="6.42">women we see the same exact thing back</text>
  <text start="206.38" dur="4.59">in two thousand eight it was roughly</text>
  <text start="209.08" dur="5">around twenty four point two percent and</text>
  <text start="210.97" dur="6.81">since that time it has skyrocketed to</text>
  <text start="214.08" dur="6.31">26.1 percent so actually it&amp;#39;s gotten</text>
  <text start="217.78" dur="6.63">worse not better and how can this be if</text>
  <text start="220.39" dur="5.46">we&amp;#39;re in this recovery well we&amp;#39;re not in</text>
  <text start="224.41" dur="4.86">a recovery the whole thing is a complete</text>
  <text start="225.85" dur="5.19">illusion and they&amp;#39;re just trying to</text>
  <text start="229.27" dur="3.39">convince everyone that everything is</text>
  <text start="231.04" dur="3.99">fine by keeping the stock market up and</text>
  <text start="232.66" dur="5.34">gold suppressed and manipulating all the</text>
  <text start="235.03" dur="6.3">statistical information and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="238" dur="7.41">seeing is that spending here in the US</text>
  <text start="241.33" dur="7.08">is continually declining and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="245.41" dur="4.86">seeing year-on-year is that income</text>
  <text start="248.41" dur="4.5">growth has slowed to four percent near</text>
  <text start="250.27" dur="5.85">its weakest since November 2013 the</text>
  <text start="252.91" dur="6.12">spending growth slowed to three point</text>
  <text start="256.12" dur="5.66">eight percent year-on-year from</text>
  <text start="259.03" dur="5.07">two-point-nine percent in January but</text>
  <text start="261.78" dur="5.59">the big thing that we have to look at</text>
  <text start="264.1" dur="7.319">right now is a major downward revision</text>
  <text start="267.37" dur="7.47">in spending January 0.5% surge in</text>
  <text start="271.419" dur="7.981">spending was revised to a near point one</text>
  <text start="274.84" dur="7.5">percent and when we look at the US</text>
  <text start="279.4" dur="6.66">personal income we see that we are on a</text>
  <text start="282.34" dur="6.78">downward trajectory it is not getting</text>
  <text start="286.06" dur="5.55">better whatsoever now why aren&amp;#39;t people</text>
  <text start="289.12" dur="4.95">spending their money well as more and</text>
  <text start="291.61" dur="4.02">more layoffs occur and as more and more</text>
  <text start="294.07" dur="3.3">people fall off the job mark</text>
  <text start="295.63" dur="6.15">as more and more people get part-time</text>
  <text start="297.37" dur="6.99">work they&amp;#39;re nervous they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="301.78" dur="4.32">extra funds they&amp;#39;re trying to keep</text>
  <text start="304.36" dur="6.06">whatever they have they&amp;#39;re barely</text>
  <text start="306.1" dur="5.85">getting by paying their bills and the</text>
  <text start="310.42" dur="4.59">people that are still working in the</text>
  <text start="311.95" dur="4.83">companies they&amp;#39;re hearing rumors of more</text>
  <text start="315.01" dur="3.81">layoffs they don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="316.78" dur="4.56">be them so they&amp;#39;re not ready to go out</text>
  <text start="318.82" dur="8.7">and spend their funds everyone is</text>
  <text start="321.34" dur="7.95">nervous and this continues on now the US</text>
  <text start="327.52" dur="5.1">government central bankers are trying to</text>
  <text start="329.29" dur="4.92">convince us that februari pending that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="332.62" dur="5.91">the important word pending home sales</text>
  <text start="334.21" dur="6.03">rose 3.5 percent month on month and it</text>
  <text start="338.53" dur="3.21">beat all expectations but you have to</text>
  <text start="340.24" dur="3.45">remember these are pending a lot of</text>
  <text start="341.74" dur="4.47">these contracts fall through they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="343.69" dur="5.7">follow through and this number is then</text>
  <text start="346.21" dur="4.92">revised much much lower later on just</text>
  <text start="349.39" dur="5.4">like we see all the other numbers that</text>
  <text start="351.13" dur="6.33">are continually lowered but when we look</text>
  <text start="354.79" dur="4.44">at housing for instance and we look at</text>
  <text start="357.46" dur="3.36">new construction where they continually</text>
  <text start="359.23" dur="3.63">tell us that new construction is just</text>
  <text start="360.82" dur="3.33">booming everywhere and we get these</text>
  <text start="362.86" dur="3.6">surges and then all of us on the next</text>
  <text start="364.15" dur="4.92">month it just drops off and we see it</text>
  <text start="366.46" dur="6.21">really doesn&amp;#39;t go anywhere but when we</text>
  <text start="369.07" dur="6.12">look at new home sales we see prices are</text>
  <text start="372.67" dur="5.1">rising much faster in the more expensive</text>
  <text start="375.19" dur="5.25">segments leaving those in either starter</text>
  <text start="377.77" dur="5.1">homes or still the lower Till&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="380.44" dur="4.37">lower tiers unable to make the usual</text>
  <text start="382.87" dur="5.31">jump that accompanies economic mobility</text>
  <text start="384.81" dur="5.14">because they aren&amp;#39;t buying up they</text>
  <text start="388.18" dur="4.08">aren&amp;#39;t selling despite rising prices</text>
  <text start="389.95" dur="4.59">which are supposed to signal at least</text>
  <text start="392.26" dur="5.43">stable demand now when we look around</text>
  <text start="394.54" dur="6.03">the United States into the east and to</text>
  <text start="397.69" dur="6.86">the south into the Midwest and the West</text>
  <text start="400.57" dur="6.33">we see the middle to lower houses</text>
  <text start="404.55" dur="5.47">they&amp;#39;re still on the market they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="406.9" dur="5.4">really moving and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="410.02" dur="4.05">people continually lowering their prices</text>
  <text start="412.3" dur="5.21">because they&amp;#39;re scratching their head</text>
  <text start="414.07" dur="6.75">wondering why my house isn&amp;#39;t moving and</text>
  <text start="417.51" dur="4.66">you would think from everything the</text>
  <text start="420.82" dur="3.599">government is telling us from the</text>
  <text start="422.17" dur="5.67">national association of realtors and all</text>
  <text start="424.419" dur="5.341">the builders and if there is demand for</text>
  <text start="427.84" dur="7.77">starter homes</text>
  <text start="429.76" dur="11.04">what should we see we should see a huge</text>
  <text start="435.61" dur="8.67">amount of building all over the place we</text>
  <text start="440.8" dur="7.62">should see construction happening all</text>
  <text start="444.28" dur="9.78">over the place but when we look around</text>
  <text start="448.42" dur="8.82">the country new home sales have been</text>
  <text start="454.06" dur="5.04">stuck around the level since the start</text>
  <text start="457.24" dur="5.87">of 2015 and really haven&amp;#39;t got anywhere</text>
  <text start="459.1" dur="7.85">and when we look at new home sales and</text>
  <text start="463.11" dur="7.38">we go back to say 2011 even before that</text>
  <text start="466.95" dur="7.87">right at the time we had the huge crash</text>
  <text start="470.49" dur="6.97">we see new home sales when all the way</text>
  <text start="474.82" dur="6.66">up to thirty percent by 2013 and then</text>
  <text start="477.46" dur="8.54">dropped down to negative five percent in</text>
  <text start="481.48" dur="9.39">at 2014 shot back up to twenty percent</text>
  <text start="486" dur="10.48">around april july of 2015 and came right</text>
  <text start="490.87" dur="8.24">back down to zero in 2016 soo new home</text>
  <text start="496.48" dur="5.73">construction is not on the rise and</text>
  <text start="499.11" dur="7.27">actually when you look at the graph we</text>
  <text start="502.21" dur="7.14">are in a downward trajectory we have hit</text>
  <text start="506.38" dur="6.63">we have not hit the mark of where we</text>
  <text start="509.35" dur="6.9">were in 2004-2005 2006 were not even</text>
  <text start="513.01" dur="4.68">close and the gap from resales suggests</text>
  <text start="516.25" dur="4.5">that home builders should be nearing a</text>
  <text start="517.69" dur="5.22">frenzy at this time constructing at a</text>
  <text start="520.75" dur="4.56">pace more toward the upper end of the</text>
  <text start="522.91" dur="5.7">historical range rather than continuing</text>
  <text start="525.31" dur="6.68">along the bottom only there isn&amp;#39;t any</text>
  <text start="528.61" dur="6.74">rush to build and sell new dwellings</text>
  <text start="531.99" dur="8.62">because we don&amp;#39;t have a housing boom</text>
  <text start="535.35" dur="8.95">this was manufactured to convince</text>
  <text start="540.61" dur="7.86">everyone that we have a housing boom and</text>
  <text start="544.3" dur="7.23">all they did to do this whereas the</text>
  <text start="548.47" dur="4.91">banks were told listen keep the houses</text>
  <text start="551.53" dur="4.29">off the market if there&amp;#39;s a foreclosure</text>
  <text start="553.38" dur="4.51">keep a lot of them off the market let</text>
  <text start="555.82" dur="3.66">the people live there the Fed stepped in</text>
  <text start="557.89" dur="4.92">bought up the toxic real estate about</text>
  <text start="559.48" dur="4.59">four trillion dollars worth and the Fed</text>
  <text start="562.81" dur="3.42">gave the bank&amp;#39;s Freeman</text>
  <text start="564.07" dur="4.5">to pump up the stock market in the</text>
  <text start="566.23" dur="3.78">meantime they make it look like</text>
  <text start="568.57" dur="2.61">everything is going well then they gave</text>
  <text start="570.01" dur="3.03">free money to the hedge fund&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="571.18" dur="4.83">investment companies foreign investors</text>
  <text start="573.04" dur="5.73">stepped in and they bought homes for</text>
  <text start="576.01" dur="4.02">cash now they didn&amp;#39;t buy one or two they</text>
  <text start="578.77" dur="3.36">a lot of the hedge funds investment</text>
  <text start="580.03" dur="4.38">companies they bought thousands upon</text>
  <text start="582.13" dur="4.5">thousands of homes and they didn&amp;#39;t sell</text>
  <text start="584.41" dur="3.83">them they held on to them they were said</text>
  <text start="586.63" dur="4.77">listen rent them if you can otherwise</text>
  <text start="588.24" dur="4.48">just hold them we need to drive up the</text>
  <text start="591.4" dur="4.41">price and that&amp;#39;s how you drive the price</text>
  <text start="592.72" dur="5.31">up you keep houses off the market you</text>
  <text start="595.81" dur="4.92">continually purchase you don&amp;#39;t put them</text>
  <text start="598.03" dur="7.29">back on the market and you drive the</text>
  <text start="600.73" dur="8.07">price up it&amp;#39;s artificial and while this</text>
  <text start="605.32" dur="8.82">was happening the mortgage departments</text>
  <text start="608.8" dur="9.09">in bank of america in chase jpmorgan</text>
  <text start="614.14" dur="5.07">chase in Wells Fargo they were laying</text>
  <text start="617.89" dur="3.57">off thousands of people in the mortgage</text>
  <text start="619.21" dur="4.11">bar because they knew they wouldn&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="621.46" dur="3.6">these people because the American people</text>
  <text start="623.32" dur="4.59">are sitting on the sidelines and this</text>
  <text start="625.06" dur="4.89">started back in 2013 well we saw a mass</text>
  <text start="627.91" dur="5.88">amount of layoffs and its continuing up</text>
  <text start="629.95" dur="6.15">until today so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="633.79" dur="8.4">now is that the housing market the</text>
  <text start="636.1" dur="8.91">retail market the job market they&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="642.19" dur="8.22">nowhere it&amp;#39;s falling apart now the</text>
  <text start="645.01" dur="8.64">Dallas Fed it has contracted now for 15</text>
  <text start="650.41" dur="6.15">months in a row the dallas fed survey</text>
  <text start="653.65" dur="6.24">came in at negative 13.6 they were</text>
  <text start="656.56" dur="4.68">expecting a negative 25.8 so I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="659.89" dur="3.66">really count that as an improvement</text>
  <text start="661.24" dur="5.49">we&amp;#39;re in the negative range and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="663.55" dur="9.36">been contracting for 15 months and we</text>
  <text start="666.73" dur="8.85">haven&amp;#39;t seen this since 2008 during the</text>
  <text start="672.91" dur="5.91">recession new orders and employment have</text>
  <text start="675.58" dur="5.04">tumbled and anyone who said the economy</text>
  <text start="678.82" dur="5.52">is not in recession I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="680.62" dur="6.78">peddling fiction at this point now it</text>
  <text start="684.34" dur="5.25">looks like the Atlanta Fed came out with</text>
  <text start="687.4" dur="6.03">an estimate for the first quarter of GDP</text>
  <text start="689.59" dur="7.37">and that estimate came out at point six</text>
  <text start="693.43" dur="6.17">percent which is</text>
  <text start="696.96" dur="5.52">absolutely awful and remember they throw</text>
  <text start="699.6" dur="5.93">in Obamacare they recalculated the</text>
  <text start="702.48" dur="6.42">numbers it&amp;#39;s becoming harder and harder</text>

  <text start="719.07" dur="9.09">there saying that several years in a row</text>
  <text start="722.64" dur="9.12">of currency wars it&amp;#39;s not working the</text>
  <text start="728.16" dur="5.37">GDP growth is hardly robust before the</text>

  <text start="744.78" dur="6.93">per year that&amp;#39;s half of the 1983 2008</text>
  <text start="748.08" dur="5.22">average and for a global trade it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="751.71" dur="4.23">complete mess I mean look at the Baltic</text>
  <text start="753.3" dur="5.04">Dry Index yes it has gone up a little</text>
  <text start="755.94" dur="3.75">bit but when we look at the graph and we</text>
  <text start="758.34" dur="4.89">go back in time from the Baltic Dry</text>
  <text start="759.69" dur="8.58">Index you can see how bad it is if we</text>

  <text start="796.08" dur="8.16">about 690 or so then it was pumped back</text>
  <text start="799.8" dur="9.86">up from that point and when we look at</text>
  <text start="804.24" dur="9.06">the graph the graph trend is declining</text>
  <text start="809.66" dur="7.51">we are at around four hundred and six</text>
