  <text start="118.509" dur="5.581">Gallup share care survey came out and</text>
  <text start="121.45" dur="5.97">this serves as a kind of early indicator</text>
  <text start="124.09" dur="5.88">to let us know how the insurance</text>
  <text start="127.42" dur="3.89">industry is doing and who&amp;#39;s signing up</text>
  <text start="129.97" dur="4.159">and who&amp;#39;s not signing up and</text>
  <text start="131.31" dur="5.77">specifically looking at Obamacare and</text>
  <text start="134.129" dur="6.94">what they&amp;#39;re reporting right now is that</text>
  <text start="137.08" dur="7.29">there is two million less people that</text>
  <text start="141.069" dur="6.211">actually signed up to Obamacare it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="144.37" dur="4.35">amazing when Obama leaves office and you</text>
  <text start="147.28" dur="3.45">know there&amp;#39;s no one manipulating the</text>
  <text start="148.72" dur="4.71">numbers you know bringing in Medicaid</text>
  <text start="150.73" dur="4.95">getting rid of these individuals pumping</text>
  <text start="153.43" dur="5.91">that up a little bit we can see the true</text>
  <text start="155.68" dur="6.199">numbers of what is really doing and the</text>
  <text start="159.34" dur="5.34">entire system it&amp;#39;s not normalizing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="161.879" dur="6.071">imploding on itself because it was never</text>
  <text start="164.68" dur="7.919">built it was never designed it was never</text>
  <text start="167.95" dur="7.259">created to be a benefit to us the people</text>
  <text start="172.599" dur="4.97">where we would have great health</text>
  <text start="175.209" dur="5.271">insurance where we would have low</text>
  <text start="177.569" dur="5.951">deductibles where we would have low</text>
  <text start="180.48" dur="6.52">premiums it wasn&amp;#39;t designed that way it</text>
  <text start="183.52" dur="6.87">was designed to help certain</text>
  <text start="187" dur="6.78">groups like the insurance industry it</text>
  <text start="190.39" dur="5.67">was to bring in profits to other groups</text>
  <text start="193.78" dur="5.34">that was bring in taxes to the</text>
  <text start="196.06" dur="4.77">government and it was to penalize anyone</text>
  <text start="199.12" dur="4.35">that didn&amp;#39;t want to go along with what</text>
  <text start="200.83" dur="6.3">they wanted that&amp;#39;s what that was all</text>
  <text start="203.47" dur="7.56">about and we can see from another Gallup</text>

  <text start="211.03" dur="6.36">the top financial current concerns</text>

  <text start="224.02" dur="4.11">very concerned because their premiums</text>
  <text start="226" dur="5.01">are continually moving up and up and up</text>
  <text start="228.13" dur="5.13">under this is too much debt not enough</text>
  <text start="231.01" dur="3.81">money to pay debts yes because people</text>
  <text start="233.26" dur="4.5">are losing jobs they&amp;#39;re not getting the</text>
  <text start="234.82" dur="7.26">raises and the other one is lack of</text>
  <text start="237.76" dur="7.41">money low wages now isn&amp;#39;t this odd that</text>
  <text start="242.08" dur="6.78">this Gallup survey that was taken among</text>
  <text start="245.17" dur="6.569">American people that these are the top</text>
  <text start="248.86" dur="6.42">financial concerns where it has to do</text>
  <text start="251.739" dur="6.451">with jobs receiving money health care</text>
  <text start="255.28" dur="5.88">everything that the people care about</text>
  <text start="258.19" dur="5.49">and what has the government done to help</text>
  <text start="261.16" dur="5.22">the people what is the central bank done</text>
  <text start="263.68" dur="3.77">to help the people absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="266.38" dur="3.45">what have they done to help themselves</text>
  <text start="267.45" dur="4.42">quite a bit because you could see how</text>
  <text start="269.83" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re living compared to the rest of</text>
  <text start="271.87" dur="7.5">the country now as soon as the g20</text>
  <text start="275.62" dur="6.42">meeting was over it looked like the deep</text>
  <text start="279.37" dur="4.65">state and their mouthpieces the</text>
  <text start="282.04" dur="5.37">corporate media they were prepared and</text>
  <text start="284.02" dur="6.209">ready for a major story to show Russian</text>
  <text start="287.41" dur="4.95">collusion once again now New York Times</text>
  <text start="290.229" dur="5.041">reported that Donald Trump&amp;#39;s son Donald</text>
  <text start="292.36" dur="7.17">Trump jr. together with pal a Paul</text>
  <text start="295.27" dur="7.62">Manafort and Jared Kushner they met with</text>
  <text start="299.53" dur="6.48">a Russian lawyer who was connected to</text>
  <text start="302.89" dur="5.19">the Kremlin back on June 9th of 2016</text>
  <text start="306.01" dur="4.56">shortly after Trump was assured of the</text>
  <text start="308.08" dur="5.399">Republican nomination now the New York</text>
  <text start="310.57" dur="5.52">Times they followed up with a new</text>
  <text start="313.479" dur="4.201">article one which seeks to explain the</text>
  <text start="316.09" dur="3.449">one thing that was missing from the</text>
  <text start="317.68" dur="3.27">original New York Times article the</text>
  <text start="319.539" dur="3.571">motive behind</text>
  <text start="320.95" dur="4.95">the said meeting and the New York Times</text>
  <text start="323.11" dur="5.73">came out and they said yes you know</text>
  <text start="325.9" dur="5.28">Trump jr. met with the Russian lawyer</text>
  <text start="328.84" dur="4.02">with the other individuals because this</text>
  <text start="331.18" dur="4.56">Russian lawyer who was attached to the</text>
  <text start="332.86" dur="5.54">Kremlin promised damaging information</text>
  <text start="335.74" dur="5.7">about Hillary Clinton now it is unclear</text>
  <text start="338.4" dur="4.21">whether the Russian lawyer Natalia I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="341.44" dur="3.48">not even gonna try to pronounce her last</text>
  <text start="342.61" dur="4.38">name actually produced the promise</text>
  <text start="344.92" dur="5.46">compromising information about Clinton</text>
  <text start="346.99" dur="6.12">now she is saying she never acted on</text>
  <text start="350.38" dur="4.71">behalf of the Russian government she</text>
  <text start="353.11" dur="4.41">said and never discussed any of these</text>
  <text start="355.09" dur="3.24">matters with any representative of the</text>
  <text start="357.52" dur="3.75">Russian government</text>
  <text start="358.33" dur="4.98">more importantly she recalled that after</text>
  <text start="361.27" dur="3.96">about 10 minutes either Kushner or</text>
  <text start="363.31" dur="4.38">Manafort completely walked out in other</text>
  <text start="365.23" dur="5.31">words the meeting was as Trump jr.</text>
  <text start="367.69" dur="6">suggested a waste of time but the</text>
  <text start="370.54" dur="4.32">punchline is this that there was no</text>
  <text start="373.69" dur="4.62">smoking gun whatsoever</text>
  <text start="374.86" dur="6.78">first the meeting took place in early</text>
  <text start="378.31" dur="5.03">June now let&amp;#39;s think about this June of</text>
  <text start="381.64" dur="7.08">2016</text>
  <text start="383.34" dur="9.4">one month before Russia was supposedly</text>
  <text start="388.72" dur="6.18">hacking the DNC server and Podesta&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="392.74" dur="4.32">emails were spread out all over the</text>
  <text start="394.9" dur="3.15">Internet so right there that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="397.06" dur="3.9">even make sense</text>
  <text start="398.05" dur="6.69">now if this indeed was this blockbuster</text>
  <text start="400.96" dur="6.42">meeting why wasn&amp;#39;t Trump himself present</text>
  <text start="404.74" dur="5.09">at this meeting why was he absent from</text>
  <text start="407.38" dur="5.61">the meeting now a little bit of</text>
  <text start="409.83" dur="5.35">investigation exposes something very</text>
  <text start="412.99" dur="5.1">important now this is coming from</text>
  <text start="415.18" dur="6.15">Trump&amp;#39;s legal team and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="418.09" dur="5.13">that they investigated into this and we</text>
  <text start="421.33" dur="5.1">have learned that the person who sought</text>
  <text start="423.22" dur="6.93">the meeting is associated with fusion</text>
  <text start="426.43" dur="6.78">GPS a firm which according to public</text>
  <text start="430.15" dur="5.55">records was retained by Democrat</text>
  <text start="433.21" dur="4.41">operatives to develop opposition</text>
  <text start="435.7" dur="4.44">research on the president which</text>
  <text start="437.62" dur="6.78">commissioned the phony steel dossier and</text>
  <text start="440.14" dur="9.51">it looks like maybe someone was setting</text>
  <text start="444.4" dur="8.6">up this meeting to trap Trump now Trump</text>
  <text start="449.65" dur="5.22">jr. he is saying that he has no problem</text>
  <text start="453" dur="4.75">testifying in front of</text>
  <text start="454.87" dur="6">Intel committee and it looks like well</text>
  <text start="457.75" dur="6.18">this might happen actually this is a</text>
  <text start="460.87" dur="4.83">good thing let&amp;#39;s get all of this out</text>
  <text start="463.93" dur="6.209">there let&amp;#39;s show that there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="465.7" dur="6.84">there and let&amp;#39;s dig deeper into where</text>
  <text start="470.139" dur="3.78">this Russian attorney came from did</text>
  <text start="472.54" dur="4.47">anyone pay this person</text>
  <text start="473.919" dur="7.231">are there other connections that need to</text>
  <text start="477.01" dur="7.08">be explored and will we find other</text>
  <text start="481.15" dur="5.22">things now the Kremlin came out Russia</text>
  <text start="484.09" dur="3.96">came out and said listen we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="486.37" dur="4.44">who this Russian lawyer is first of all</text>
  <text start="488.05" dur="5.64">and we don&amp;#39;t keep track of all these</text>
  <text start="490.81" dur="7.109">Russian lawyers and this Russian lawyer</text>
  <text start="493.69" dur="6.539">we have no clue who this individual is</text>
  <text start="497.919" dur="4.921">and how they are connected so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="500.229" dur="6.241">having a problem here in believing this</text>
  <text start="502.84" dur="5.91">story now it looks like this story that</text>
  <text start="506.47" dur="4.35">the corporate media is running it seems</text>
  <text start="508.75" dur="4.83">like they don&amp;#39;t want to report on the</text>
  <text start="510.82" dur="6.69">real story now what is the real story</text>
  <text start="513.58" dur="6.75">well the hill is reporting in addition</text>
  <text start="517.51" dur="7.23">to the leaked memos Comey also leaked</text>
  <text start="520.33" dur="6.6">classified information in direct</text>
  <text start="524.74" dur="5.67">violation of the FBI rules and</text>
  <text start="526.93" dur="8.88">regulation now Comey just found himself</text>
  <text start="530.41" dur="8.28">in trouble just like Clinton but who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="535.81" dur="6.93">going to protect him because he was</text>
  <text start="538.69" dur="6.45">there to protect her who&amp;#39;s protecting</text>
  <text start="542.74" dur="4.59">Comey right now and it looks like Comey</text>
  <text start="545.14" dur="4.71">is to be is about to be investigated for</text>
  <text start="547.33" dur="4.82">the exact same thing which he absolved</text>
  <text start="549.85" dur="6.45">Hillary Clinton of doing last summer</text>
  <text start="552.15" dur="6.82">Comey broke his own agency rules he</text>
  <text start="556.3" dur="4.23">ignored the same security protocols that</text>
  <text start="558.97" dur="4.98">he publicly criticized Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="560.53" dur="7.8">for for doing in the 2016 presidential</text>
  <text start="563.95" dur="6.99">election and we see that Comey right now</text>
  <text start="568.33" dur="5.67">by testifying in front of the Senate</text>
  <text start="570.94" dur="6.089">Intelligence panel he kind of</text>
  <text start="574" dur="7.08">incriminated himself because he gave</text>
  <text start="577.029" dur="6.781">this memo to a friend this memo is not</text>
  <text start="581.08" dur="6.21">his to hand out because if you look at</text>
  <text start="583.81" dur="4.83">the FBI policy all information acquired</text>
  <text start="587.29" dur="3.09">and can</text>
  <text start="588.64" dur="4.77">action with my official duties with the</text>
  <text start="590.38" dur="4.95">FBI and all official material to which I</text>
  <text start="593.41" dur="5.97">have access to remain the property of</text>
  <text start="595.33" dur="7.19">the United States of America and that an</text>
  <text start="599.38" dur="6.36">agent will not reveal by any means any</text>
  <text start="602.52" dur="5.41">information of material from or related</text>
  <text start="605.74" dur="3.87">to FBI files or any other information</text>
  <text start="607.93" dur="5.4">acquired by virtue of my official</text>
  <text start="609.61" dur="5.67">employment to any unauthorized recipient</text>
  <text start="613.33" dur="4.73">without prior official written</text>
  <text start="615.28" dur="5.4">authorization by the FBI</text>
  <text start="618.06" dur="4.69">now of course Trump came out and he said</text>
  <text start="620.68" dur="4.32">disk let you know Comey is leaking of</text>
  <text start="622.75" dur="3.24">classified information to the media this</text>
  <text start="625" dur="3.99">is so illegal</text>
  <text start="625.99" dur="3.93">again unmasking leaking confidential</text>
  <text start="628.99" dur="5.13">information</text>
  <text start="629.92" dur="7.83">it is completely illegal now what&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="634.12" dur="6.39">better about all of this is that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="637.75" dur="6.99">trying to use the same exact excuse that</text>
  <text start="640.51" dur="7.35">Clinton did because Daniel Richmond who</text>
  <text start="644.74" dur="4.95">was an individual who received the</text>
  <text start="647.86" dur="5.19">leaked memos at least one of the leaked</text>
  <text start="649.69" dur="6.21">memos claims the memo that was leaked to</text>
  <text start="653.05" dur="4.32">him by the FBI director well it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="655.9" dur="6">have any markings on it didn&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="657.37" dur="8.07">classified on it now this is ridiculous</text>
  <text start="661.9" dur="7.95">because it&amp;#39;s not the markings on the</text>
  <text start="665.44" dur="8.01">memo it is what is contained within the</text>
  <text start="669.85" dur="8.12">memo and they&amp;#39;re trying to use the same</text>
  <text start="673.45" dur="8.1">exact strategy that Hillary Clinton used</text>
  <text start="677.97" dur="6.66">so it&amp;#39;s not the marking that renders a</text>
  <text start="681.55" dur="6.72">document classified it&amp;#39;s the content</text>
  <text start="684.63" dur="5.41">Comey knows this he&amp;#39;s been in the</text>
  <text start="688.27" dur="4.26">intelligence arena</text>
  <text start="690.04" dur="5.7">he&amp;#39;s headed he was the head of the FBI</text>
  <text start="692.53" dur="6.21">he knows this and he&amp;#39;s trying to use</text>
  <text start="695.74" dur="6.99">this to make everyone think that it</text>
  <text start="698.74" dur="7.02">needs a classified working on top and if</text>
  <text start="702.73" dur="4.68">you notice the corporate media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="705.76" dur="4.65">not looking at this whatsoever</text>
  <text start="707.41" dur="7.05">they&amp;#39;re looking at Trump jr. who spoke</text>
  <text start="710.41" dur="8.28">to a Russian lawyer who cares this is a</text>
  <text start="714.46" dur="6.66">nothing burger once again now very</text>
  <text start="718.69" dur="3.72">interestingly there has been new</text>
  <text start="721.12" dur="6.15">research that show</text>
  <text start="722.41" dur="8.25">the gusoff er 2.0 files they were not</text>
  <text start="727.27" dur="6.54">hacked by Russia which we know they were</text>
  <text start="730.66" dur="5.43">copied locally now there was an</text>
  <text start="733.81" dur="5.16">independent researcher known as the</text>
  <text start="736.09" dur="5.28">forensic Gator which suggests that the</text>
  <text start="738.97" dur="5.7">files eventually published by gusoff or</text>

  <text start="744.67" dur="4.77">by a person with physical access to the</text>
  <text start="747.31" dur="5.61">computer possibly connected to the</text>
  <text start="749.44" dur="5.46">internal DNC Network the individual most</text>
  <text start="752.92" dur="4.35">likely used a USB Drive to copy the</text>
  <text start="754.9" dur="4.92">information so what did the forensic</text>
  <text start="757.27" dur="4.98">ATAR find well they found that the files</text>
  <text start="759.82" dur="5.81">that were eventually published by gusoff</text>
  <text start="762.25" dur="6.51">were 2.0 where first copied to a system</text>
  <text start="765.63" dur="6.25">located in the Eastern time zone now</text>
  <text start="768.76" dur="5.19">with this conclusion supported by the</text>
  <text start="771.88" dur="5.07">observation that the zip file times</text>
  <text start="773.95" dur="6.06">after adjustment to East Coast time fall</text>
  <text start="776.95" dur="5.31">into the range of the file times in the</text>
  <text start="780.01" dur="6.09">other compressed files in the RAR files</text>
  <text start="782.26" dur="6.99">now this suggests that the information</text>
  <text start="786.1" dur="7.56">eventually published by gusoff or 2.0</text>
  <text start="789.25" dur="7.86">was not obtained by russian hackers</text>
  <text start="793.66" dur="6.93">because the time zones in both are on</text>
  <text start="797.11" dur="6.69">the east coast their Eastern Standard</text>
  <text start="800.59" dur="6.93">Time which tells us that it was not</text>
  <text start="803.8" dur="7.56">Russia and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="807.52" dur="7.14">their entire Russian hacking theory it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="811.36" dur="6.09">really starting to fall apart and if</text>
  <text start="814.66" dur="6.03">someone could actually take a look at</text>
  <text start="817.45" dur="6.75">the server maybe like the FBI Homeland</text>
  <text start="820.69" dur="6.44">Security maybe the local police or</text>
  <text start="824.2" dur="6.03">anyone else except for CrowdStrike</text>
  <text start="827.13" dur="6.61">they would see that this server was</text>
  <text start="830.23" dur="6.87">never hacked so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="833.74" dur="5.64">now is that Comey is in trouble</text>
  <text start="837.1" dur="5.37">there is evidence that&amp;#39;s coming out that</text>
  <text start="839.38" dur="7.14">he was a leaker which we know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="842.47" dur="7.02">leaking classified information and again</text>
  <text start="846.52" dur="4.08">the world is starting to hear about this</text>
  <text start="849.49" dur="2.94">of course the corporate media doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="850.6" dur="4.87">want to report on this but we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="852.43" dur="5.62">to hear a lot more things about what is</text>
  <text start="855.47" dur="5.28">happening with the DNC because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="858.05" dur="4.77">more and more people questioning looking</text>
  <text start="860.75" dur="4.89">into it and you can see that all these</text>
  <text start="862.82" dur="4.65">bad guys who are within government all</text>
  <text start="865.64" dur="5.01">the ones who&amp;#39;ve been breaking the laws</text>
  <text start="867.47" dur="6.84">well the evidence is starting to pour</text>
  <text start="870.65" dur="6.53">out and as we learn more and more we can</text>
  <text start="874.31" dur="5.88">see that this is one gigantic web of</text>
  <text start="877.18" dur="5.35">these criminals doing all these things</text>
  <text start="880.19" dur="5.85">and trying to cover up everything that</text>
  <text start="882.53" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re doing but guess what it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="886.04" dur="4.68">to catch up with them and we can see it</text>
  <text start="888.2" dur="5.22">already is it&amp;#39;s getting worse and worse</text>
  <text start="890.72" dur="6.96">as time goes on now</text>
  <text start="893.42" dur="6.21">after Trump was at the g20 meeting he</text>
  <text start="897.68" dur="3.05">said that Russia and the United States</text>
  <text start="899.63" dur="4.25">were going to work together on a</text>
  <text start="900.73" dur="8.86">cybersecurity unit and of course we had</text>
  <text start="903.88" dur="8.47">Lindsey Graham we had Marco Rubio we had</text>
  <text start="909.59" dur="4.35">McCain all these individuals come out</text>
  <text start="912.35" dur="3.78">coming out saying this is the dumbest</text>
  <text start="913.94" dur="4.71">idea ever because remember they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="916.13" dur="3.42">against Russia they&amp;#39;re neocons they want</text>
  <text start="918.65" dur="2.85">war with Russia</text>
  <text start="919.55" dur="3.57">this can&amp;#39;t be and we could see that</text>
  <text start="921.5" dur="3.9">Trump right now he&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="923.12" dur="6.54">backpedaling on what was discussed in</text>
  <text start="925.4" dur="6.6">the g20 meeting with Putin and he needs</text>
  <text start="929.66" dur="6.87">to stand strong with this because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="932" dur="7.98">showing the world with Putin that listen</text>
  <text start="936.53" dur="6.3">we can work together we can have a cyber</text>
  <text start="939.98" dur="6.12">security force working together to stop</text>
  <text start="942.83" dur="6.24">all this hacking Russia does not have to</text>
  <text start="946.1" dur="6.21">be the enemy of the United States which</text>
  <text start="949.07" dur="5.46">it really isn&amp;#39;t I mean the Russia has</text>
  <text start="952.31" dur="3.12">been extending their hand over and over</text>
  <text start="954.53" dur="3.15">and over again</text>
  <text start="955.43" dur="4.97">and Paul Craig Roberts is out there and</text>
  <text start="957.68" dur="4.92">he does bring up a very good point that</text>
  <text start="960.4" dur="4.81">Trump is going to have a very difficult</text>
  <text start="962.6" dur="4.71">time in improving relations with Russia</text>
  <text start="965.21" dur="5.16">because the government all the neocons</text>
  <text start="967.31" dur="5.01">the deep state central bank and the US</text>
  <text start="970.37" dur="4.22">media which is the mouthpiece for all</text>
  <text start="972.32" dur="5.79">these individuals well they oppose</text>
  <text start="974.59" dur="5.32">improved relations with Russia and this</text>
  <text start="978.11" dur="4.2">is going to be very very difficult and</text>
  <text start="979.91" dur="6.3">he points out like I pointed out on</text>
  <text start="982.31" dur="7.17">Sunday nikki Haley is Aniak on Tillerson</text>
  <text start="986.21" dur="6.47">is another problem these individuals</text>
  <text start="989.48" dur="5.669">always counter what he&amp;#39;s trying to do</text>
  <text start="992.68" dur="2.89">when he says improve relations with</text>
  <text start="995.149" dur="3.451">Russia</text>
  <text start="995.57" dur="5.79">well Tillison comes out we&amp;#39;re increasing</text>
  <text start="998.6" dur="5.4">sanctions on Russia if Russia doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1001.36" dur="4.56">withdraw their troops from Ukraine nikki</text>
  <text start="1004" dur="4.889">Haley is out there saying no Russia is</text>
  <text start="1005.92" dur="5.279">our enemy so whatever is happening here</text>
  <text start="1008.889" dur="4.981">we still have these problems of these</text>
  <text start="1011.199" dur="5.281">individuals these individuals need to be</text>
  <text start="1013.87" dur="5.61">removed but one thing is happening is</text>
  <text start="1016.48" dur="5.49">that this Senate bill on these Russian</text>
  <text start="1019.48" dur="6.63">sanctions well the house is saying</text>
  <text start="1021.97" dur="6.66">listen we need to modify this bill we</text>
  <text start="1026.11" dur="4.319">need to give the president leeway if he</text>
  <text start="1028.63" dur="4.679">wants to negotiate any of these</text>
  <text start="1030.429" dur="5.311">sanctions or not implement these</text>
  <text start="1033.309" dur="4.711">sanctions and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="1035.74" dur="4.8">this sanction bill it&amp;#39;s really not</text>
  <text start="1038.02" dur="4.5">moving anywhere at this point because it</text>
  <text start="1040.54" dur="4.23">looks like it&amp;#39;s frozen in the house</text>
  <text start="1042.52" dur="4.319">because they want to give the president</text>
  <text start="1044.77" dur="4.409">the option to do different things with</text>
  <text start="1046.839" dur="4.441">Russia and it looks like Trump wants to</text>
  <text start="1049.179" dur="3.571">have a relationship with Russia which</text>
  <text start="1051.28" dur="4.92">would be a good thing for the United</text>
  <text start="1052.75" dur="6.33">States now we know that nikki Haley was</text>
  <text start="1056.2" dur="5.19">out there and the neocons deep state</text>
  <text start="1059.08" dur="4.74">central bank where they were saying that</text>
  <text start="1061.39" dur="6.84">North Korea North Korea fired a</text>
  <text start="1063.82" dur="6.66">ballistic missile now during the UN</text>
  <text start="1068.23" dur="6.36">draft that the United States was</text>
  <text start="1070.48" dur="7.439">creating Russia said listen you need to</text>
  <text start="1074.59" dur="6.39">include the data so we can compare it to</text>
  <text start="1077.919" dur="5.551">our radar systems to see if it matches</text>
  <text start="1080.98" dur="4.98">because they didn&amp;#39;t say it right off the</text>
  <text start="1083.47" dur="5.43">bat I had a funny feeling that their</text>
  <text start="1085.96" dur="5.459">data shows that it was not a ballistic</text>
  <text start="1088.9" dur="4.5">missile now the u.s. is not including</text>
  <text start="1091.419" dur="5.64">any data showing that it was a ballistic</text>
  <text start="1093.4" dur="6.96">missile Russia has said that North Korea</text>
  <text start="1097.059" dur="6.12">did not fire an intern intercontinental</text>
  <text start="1100.36" dur="5.25">ballistic missile in the recent test</text>
  <text start="1103.179" dur="5.701">even though the u.s. is saying that they</text>
  <text start="1105.61" dur="7.069">did they&amp;#39;re saying that their radar</text>
  <text start="1108.88" dur="6.9">station deployed in the ER Kuck region</text>
  <text start="1112.679" dur="5.351">monitored the launch of the 14</text>
  <text start="1115.78" dur="5.31">medium-range ballistic missile from</text>
  <text start="1118.03" dur="4.92">North Korea which flew a distance of 510</text>
  <text start="1121.09" dur="4.47">kilometers in 14 minutes we</text>
  <text start="1122.95" dur="5.73">in altitude of 535 kilometers before</text>
  <text start="1125.56" dur="6.81">landing in the Sea of Japan and they</text>
  <text start="1128.68" dur="6.48">detailed the trajectory they monitor the</text>
  <text start="1132.37" dur="6.6">flight path and they said this is not a</text>
  <text start="1135.16" dur="6.6">ballistic missile this is a medium-range</text>
  <text start="1138.97" dur="4.86">missile now this is very interesting and</text>
  <text start="1141.76" dur="4.53">we can see why Russia said we would like</text>
  <text start="1143.83" dur="3.87">to have the data showing that this is a</text>
  <text start="1146.29" dur="4.23">ballistic missile because they had</text>
  <text start="1147.7" dur="4.92">something completely different but again</text>
  <text start="1150.52" dur="3.93">the neocons a deep state</text>
  <text start="1152.62" dur="3.39">they don&amp;#39;t want that part out there</text>
  <text start="1154.45" dur="6.66">because they&amp;#39;re trying to push their</text>
  <text start="1156.01" dur="7.32">agenda now China they are reducing all</text>
  <text start="1161.11" dur="5.16">military contacts with North Korea</text>
  <text start="1163.33" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re trying to they&amp;#39;re complying with</text>
  <text start="1166.27" dur="5.91">the UN resolution and they want to show</text>
  <text start="1168.76" dur="5.88">that yes they are onboard with the world</text>
  <text start="1172.18" dur="5.61">showing that we condemn what North Korea</text>
  <text start="1174.64" dur="4.26">is doing right now and we see at this</text>
  <text start="1177.79" dur="3.51">point that yes</text>
  <text start="1178.9" dur="5.19">China and Russia they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="1181.3" dur="4.35">implementing their plan to try to stop</text>
  <text start="1184.09" dur="4.98">what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="1185.65" dur="4.89">now Tillerson he is out in Ukraine right</text>
  <text start="1189.07" dur="5.82">after the g20 meeting he met with</text>
  <text start="1190.54" dur="7.61">poroshenko and he quickly went after</text>
  <text start="1194.89" dur="5.7">Russia saying listen that the</text>
  <text start="1198.15" dur="3.78">fundamental u.s. goal in the region is</text>
  <text start="1200.59" dur="5.1">to restore Ukraine to its</text>
  <text start="1201.93" dur="6.49">pre-revolutionary size which means we</text>
  <text start="1205.69" dur="6.06">want Crimea back and the southeastern</text>
  <text start="1208.42" dur="6.18">area now remember the u.s. created this</text>
  <text start="1211.75" dur="4.59">coup d&amp;#39;etat and the south eastern people</text>
  <text start="1214.6" dur="3.6">in the people in Crimea decided they</text>
  <text start="1216.34" dur="4.89">didn&amp;#39;t want to be a part of what was</text>
  <text start="1218.2" dur="5.34">happening now again we have Tillerson</text>
  <text start="1221.23" dur="4.62">part of the neocon party we have nikki</text>
  <text start="1223.54" dur="4.5">Haley part of the Minicon party where</text>
  <text start="1225.85" dur="5.28">you can see every time something happens</text>
  <text start="1228.04" dur="5.55">well they resort back to their neocon</text>
  <text start="1231.13" dur="5.46">approach and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="1233.59" dur="4.86">that during the g20 meeting when Trump</text>
  <text start="1236.59" dur="6.03">meant Putin and they spoke to each other</text>
  <text start="1238.45" dur="6.69">only Lavrov and Tillerson were within</text>
  <text start="1242.62" dur="4.62">this meeting now Trump kept pretty much</text>
  <text start="1245.14" dur="3.99">everyone else out all the neocons and</text>
  <text start="1247.24" dur="5.18">everyone else because he wanted to make</text>
  <text start="1249.13" dur="7.02">sure what happened there was correct in</text>
  <text start="1252.42" dur="4.239">what was let out now Tillerson was in</text>
  <text start="1256.15" dur="2.869">there</text>
  <text start="1256.659" dur="4.71">and he would be the only other person</text>
  <text start="1259.019" dur="4.78">he&amp;#39;d be the only other person that knew</text>
  <text start="1261.369" dur="5.94">what happened in there and if anything</text>
  <text start="1263.799" dur="7.11">comes out Trump automatically knows it</text>
  <text start="1267.309" dur="7.8">is Tillerson so he kind of set him up in</text>

  <text start="1405.19" dur="3.63">Syrian democratic forces whatever is</text>
  <text start="1407.11" dur="3.779">happening out in Syria</text>
  <text start="1408.82" dur="5.04">it looks like Russia the Syrian army</text>
  <text start="1410.889" dur="5.16">they are pushing through and basically</text>
  <text start="1413.86" dur="4.289">eliminating these terrorist groups but</text>
  <text start="1416.049" dur="4.35">we could see that the deep state their</text>
  <text start="1418.149" dur="5.28">plan right now is to set up more</text>
  <text start="1420.399" dur="6.811">military bases in Syria to try to</text>
  <text start="1423.429" dur="6.151">establish a zone where this is going to</text>
  <text start="1427.21" dur="4.74">be controlled by the Kurds by the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1429.58" dur="4.74">democratic forces which is a group which</text>
  <text start="1431.95" dur="4.62">they created where they said ok here we</text>
  <text start="1434.32" dur="3.9">have a new group it&amp;#39;s made up of Syrians</text>
  <text start="1436.57" dur="3.839">so you can&amp;#39;t say that we don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="1438.22" dur="3.75">group that has no Syrians in it because</text>
  <text start="1440.409" dur="4.441">everyone started to point out that the</text>
  <text start="1441.97" dur="5.549">Free Syrian Army had less than 10% of</text>
  <text start="1444.85" dur="4.47">Syrians in the group so they created a</text>
  <text start="1447.519" dur="4.26">group with more Syrians and then they</text>
  <text start="1449.32" dur="4.62">created another group because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1451.779" dur="5.09">not on any of the terrorist list and</text>
  <text start="1453.94" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;re showing that yes these are all</text>
  <text start="1456.869" dur="5.44">grassroot groups that the deep state is</text>
  <text start="1460.45" dur="3.75">creating which makes no sense whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1462.309" dur="3.99">I mean it&amp;#39;s coming to the point where</text>
  <text start="1464.2" dur="2.76">it&amp;#39;s getting absolutely ridiculous we</text>
  <text start="1466.299" dur="3.45">see in Iraq</text>
  <text start="1466.96" dur="5.37">well the Islamic state they&amp;#39;re almost</text>
  <text start="1469.749" dur="5.28">completely gone in this country and</text>
  <text start="1472.33" dur="6.15">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is out in the</text>
  <text start="1475.029" dur="5.701">corporate media we see headline news</text>
  <text start="1478.48" dur="4.139">that even though the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="1480.73" dur="4.86">gone that doesn&amp;#39;t mean terror is</text>
  <text start="1482.619" dur="5.88">completely gone they&amp;#39;re trying to figure</text>
  <text start="1485.59" dur="6.179">out a way to keep this going</text>
  <text start="1488.499" dur="5.79">to stay in these areas because remember</text>
  <text start="1491.769" dur="4.41">once the Islamic state once al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="1494.289" dur="4.26">once el sham once all these terrorist</text>
  <text start="1496.179" dur="4.86">groups are gone guess what there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1498.549" dur="4.11">reason for the u.s. to be there but this</text>
  <text start="1501.039" dur="3.541">was never the reason they were there in</text>
  <text start="1502.659" dur="4.02">the first place the reason they were</text>
  <text start="1504.58" dur="5.459">there in the first place is to keep</text>
  <text start="1506.679" dur="6.151">control of the entire area to keep</text>
  <text start="1510.039" dur="5.421">puppet governments in this area to keep</text>
  <text start="1512.83" dur="5.9">control of their natural resources</text>
  <text start="1515.46" dur="5.199">empire building that was the real reason</text>
  <text start="1518.73" dur="2.919">and nothing to do with the terrorists</text>
  <text start="1520.659" dur="3.391">because we know the terrorists were the</text>
  <text start="1521.649" dur="4.831">paid mercenary armies of the deep</text>
  <text start="1524.05" dur="5.4">date so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="1526.48" dur="6.03">that everything is falling apart around</text>
  <text start="1529.45" dur="4.71">them and as we can see there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="1532.51" dur="4.35">more evidence that is coming out slowly</text>
  <text start="1534.16" dur="5.25">but surely and eventually we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1536.86" dur="6.93">start seeing people go to jail it might</text>
  <text start="1539.41" dur="6.63">not be in the quantity that we want but</text>
  <text start="1543.79" dur="5.16">we&amp;#39;re going to see certain individuals</text>
  <text start="1546.04" dur="4.62">taking the fall for certain crimes maybe</text>
