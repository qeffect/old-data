  <text start="39.239" dur="4.741">September 18 2015 and the title of this</text>
  <text start="42.27" dur="6.12">episode is history is about to repeat</text>
  <text start="43.98" dur="6.69">itself the Fed just made the same 1927</text>
  <text start="48.39" dur="5.07">mistake let&amp;#39;s get right into the</text>
  <text start="50.67" dur="5.43">economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="53.46" dur="5.96">earlier today before the US markets even</text>
  <text start="56.1" dur="6.41">opened there was a UK flash crash</text>
  <text start="59.42" dur="5.8">everything started to fall apart and</text>
  <text start="62.51" dur="4.99">they&amp;#39;re looking into it right now trying</text>
  <text start="65.22" dur="6.12">to investigate why all of a sudden there</text>
  <text start="67.5" dur="8.729">was a sudden move in the FTSE 100 index</text>
  <text start="71.34" dur="6.3">I mean it just fell directly down now of</text>
  <text start="76.229" dur="4.471">course some people are calling this a</text>
  <text start="77.64" dur="5.78">fat finger who there was a mistake but</text>
  <text start="80.7" dur="5.64">I&amp;#39;m sure it was not a mistake because</text>
  <text start="83.42" dur="4.36">there is no coincidences they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="86.34" dur="5.22">making these type of mistakes in the</text>
  <text start="87.78" dur="8.67">market this was done on purpose now we</text>
  <text start="91.56" dur="6.629">realize that the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="96.45" dur="4.44">need to get rid of cash because they</text>
  <text start="98.189" dur="5.311">understand that when this whole entire</text>
  <text start="100.89" dur="4.769">economy falls apart they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="103.5" dur="4.469">have to use the bail and documents which</text>
  <text start="105.659" dur="4.411">they created and they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="107.969" dur="4.591">to capture everyone&amp;#39;s money that&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="110.07" dur="6.509">the bank and we see Bank of England</text>
  <text start="112.56" dur="6.53">chief economist Andy Haldane appears to</text>
  <text start="116.579" dur="5.28">have fully transitioned to the dark side</text>
  <text start="119.09" dur="4.989">he made the case for the radical option</text>
  <text start="121.859" dur="5.851">of supporting the economy with negative</text>
  <text start="124.079" dur="7.081">interest rates and even suggesting that</text>
  <text start="127.71" dur="6.63">cash will need to be abolished so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="131.16" dur="7.32">continually hearing out of all the</text>
  <text start="134.34" dur="7.23">central banks that they need to get rid</text>
  <text start="138.48" dur="5.7">of cash and they&amp;#39;re pushing this hard</text>
  <text start="141.57" dur="4.83">right now because they realize they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="144.18" dur="3.81">running out of time they can have the</text>
  <text start="146.4" dur="3.74">people run to the banks like the people</text>
  <text start="147.99" dur="4.2">in Greece did and remove the cash</text>
  <text start="150.14" dur="4.72">because then the banks will be insolvent</text>
  <text start="152.19" dur="6.75">they will have no one to take the money</text>
  <text start="154.86" dur="6.69">from to prop up the banks this is going</text>
  <text start="158.94" dur="5.52">to pose a problem and one of the ways to</text>
  <text start="161.55" dur="5.73">fix it is to stop people from taking out</text>
  <text start="164.46" dur="5.04">cash by getting rid of it I mean this is</text>
  <text start="167.28" dur="6.71">their plan is it going to work most</text>
  <text start="169.5" dur="8.79">likely not and here in the United States</text>
  <text start="173.99" dur="6.94">the economy with all these layoffs with</text>
  <text start="178.29" dur="6.47">retail contracting with home sales</text>
  <text start="180.93" dur="7.53">starting to fall apart the economy is</text>
  <text start="184.76" dur="6.34">not getting any better actually it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="188.46" dur="5.52">accelerating and as we move into this</text>
  <text start="191.1" dur="4.86">fall and into the winter it&amp;#39;s just going</text>
  <text start="193.98" dur="4.08">to get worse and of course they&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="195.96" dur="4.29">the excuse that it&amp;#39;s the weather this is</text>
  <text start="198.06" dur="5.82">why sales in the holiday season worked</text>
  <text start="200.25" dur="5.25">very well didn&amp;#39;t do well well the</text>
  <text start="203.88" dur="4.32">holiday season is the time when sales</text>
  <text start="205.5" dur="5.61">are supposed to do well stores depend on</text>
  <text start="208.2" dur="5.55">this businesses depend on this and we</text>
  <text start="211.11" dur="5.31">saw last year with the unemployment</text>
  <text start="213.75" dur="5.37">around what five point eight five point</text>
  <text start="216.42" dur="5.37">nine percent sales were absolutely</text>
  <text start="219.12" dur="4.83">horrific now that unemployment is down</text>
  <text start="221.79" dur="6.06">to five point one percent we should see</text>
  <text start="223.95" dur="6.06">sales do incredibly well but if we look</text>
  <text start="227.85" dur="6.12">at the track record and we go back to</text>
  <text start="230.01" dur="7.41">2009 going forward when unemployment was</text>
  <text start="233.97" dur="5.31">at eleven ten nine percent sales were</text>
  <text start="237.42" dur="5.1">much better and now we&amp;#39;re down in the</text>
  <text start="239.28" dur="5.19">five range and sales are awful how could</text>
  <text start="242.52" dur="4.2">that be let&amp;#39;s use some common sense here</text>
  <text start="244.47" dur="4.61">makes no sense if more people are</text>
  <text start="246.72" dur="6.93">employed more people are making money</text>
  <text start="249.08" dur="7.24">why our sales worse off they should be a</text>
  <text start="253.65" dur="4.38">lot better if unemployment was at ten</text>
  <text start="256.32" dur="4.77">percent or eleven percent or nine</text>
  <text start="258.03" dur="4.95">percent but we&amp;#39;re not saying that this</text>
  <text start="261.09" dur="4.71">is one way you can tell the numbers are</text>
  <text start="262.98" dur="3.98">completely manipulated I mean Qualcomm</text>
  <text start="265.8" dur="5.13">right now is going to be laying off</text>
  <text start="266.96" dur="6.7">1,300 people and San Diego all we are</text>
  <text start="270.93" dur="9.66">hearing right now are more and more</text>
  <text start="273.66" dur="9.84">layoffs and the housing market is not</text>
  <text start="280.59" dur="7.68">going to get any better we see the you</text>
  <text start="283.5" dur="9.45">one was devalued which means that the</text>
  <text start="288.27" dur="7.35">people the investors in China who are</text>
  <text start="292.95" dur="4.14">buying the real estate the real estate</text>
  <text start="295.62" dur="2.76">here in the US is going to be more</text>
  <text start="297.09" dur="3.23">expensive</text>
  <text start="298.38" dur="6.39">we&amp;#39;re starting to see a slowdown of</text>
  <text start="300.32" dur="7.45">purchases from Chinese buyers which is</text>
  <text start="304.77" dur="4.56">going to hurt the market I mean the</text>
  <text start="307.77" dur="2.94">people of the United States they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="309.33" dur="2.97">been purchasing because we know the</text>
  <text start="310.71" dur="3.21">mortgage departments have been laying</text>
  <text start="312.3" dur="3.8">off thousands upon thousands of people</text>
  <text start="313.92" dur="5.52">we know mortgage applications have been</text>
  <text start="316.1" dur="6.82">taken a dive and now we see foreign</text>
  <text start="319.44" dur="5.37">investors stepping back away saying</text>
  <text start="322.92" dur="5.37">listen this is getting too expensive now</text>
  <text start="324.81" dur="6">because our money doesn&amp;#39;t go as far this</text>
  <text start="328.29" dur="4.98">is going to pose a problem we have the</text>
  <text start="330.81" dur="4.08">Fed out there creating this free money</text>
  <text start="333.27" dur="4.08">giving it to investors and hedge funds</text>
  <text start="334.89" dur="4.38">to continually prop up the housing</text>
  <text start="337.35" dur="4.05">market and we have to remember they</text>
  <text start="339.27" dur="3.6">don&amp;#39;t want the prices to come down they</text>
  <text start="341.4" dur="4.02">want them to go up because the prices</text>
  <text start="342.87" dur="4.68">come down all the houses that the banks</text>
  <text start="345.42" dur="5.25">are holding on their books that they</text>
  <text start="347.55" dur="6.75">didn&amp;#39;t release to the market they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="350.67" dur="5.43">gonna lose value which means the banks</text>
  <text start="354.3" dur="4.38">are going to have to adjust their</text>
  <text start="356.1" dur="5.19">balance sheets which means these banks</text>
  <text start="358.68" dur="3.78">are going to be insolvent if they do</text>
  <text start="361.29" dur="3.99">this and this is why they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="362.46" dur="5.36">keep the prices up so high because what</text>
  <text start="365.28" dur="5.58">they did was they told the banks listen</text>
  <text start="367.82" dur="6.07">do not release the foreclosures do not</text>
  <text start="370.86" dur="6.96">release these homes keep them on your</text>
  <text start="373.89" dur="5.93">books we need to drive the prices up and</text>
  <text start="377.82" dur="4.32">this is what&amp;#39;s been happening all along</text>
  <text start="379.82" dur="4.9">meanwhile we had hedge funds and</text>
  <text start="382.14" dur="4.74">investment companies purchasing houses</text>
  <text start="384.72" dur="4.29">by the thousands hold on to them rent</text>
  <text start="386.88" dur="4.59">them if you can foreign investors come</text>
  <text start="389.01" dur="4.71">in purchase homes this is all starting</text>
  <text start="391.47" dur="5.72">to fall apart at this point and we have</text>
  <text start="393.72" dur="6.21">noticed that more and more homes are</text>
  <text start="397.19" dur="4.99">staying on the market the prices are</text>
  <text start="399.93" dur="4.89">coming down they can&amp;#39;t get rid of them</text>
  <text start="402.18" dur="7.26">traffics drying up existing home sales</text>
  <text start="404.82" dur="9.24">are down new constructions down it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="409.44" dur="7.82">starting to look like 2008 it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="414.06" dur="5.82">we&amp;#39;re repeating the same exact patterns</text>
  <text start="417.26" dur="4.81">now the central banks in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="419.88" dur="5.01">are trying to convince the Gulf states</text>
  <text start="422.07" dur="4.77">to begin issuing debt even if there is</text>
  <text start="424.89" dur="5.339">no need to borrow because we have to</text>
  <text start="426.84" dur="5.45">remember one important thing the product</text>
  <text start="430.229" dur="5.101">of the central bank is debt</text>
  <text start="432.29" dur="4.9">just issue debt wherever you possibly</text>
  <text start="435.33" dur="5.52">can it doesn&amp;#39;t make a difference as long</text>
  <text start="437.19" dur="7.14">as it&amp;#39;s out there our systems propped up</text>
  <text start="440.85" dur="5.37">and this is what they&amp;#39;ve been doing all</text>
  <text start="444.33" dur="4.74">this time by going into each one of</text>
  <text start="446.22" dur="4.53">these countries removing the government</text>
  <text start="449.07" dur="4.53">replacing it with a puppet government</text>
  <text start="450.75" dur="4.86">setting up a central bank issuing debt</text>
  <text start="453.6" dur="7.56">and putting the dollar on their natural</text>
  <text start="455.61" dur="7.8">resources to prop the system up we see</text>
  <text start="461.16" dur="5.4">Peter Schiff is out there saying once</text>
  <text start="463.41" dur="6.93">again the feds bark fails to live up to</text>
  <text start="466.56" dur="5.97">the bite the feds Open Market Committee</text>
  <text start="470.34" dur="4.05">painted a picture of a stable and</text>
  <text start="472.53" dur="4.41">growing economy that was just about</text>
  <text start="474.39" dur="4.86">ready for tightening cycle to begin its</text>
  <text start="476.94" dur="5.04">decision to hold off for now was</text>
  <text start="479.25" dur="5.28">position as a temporary concession to</text>
  <text start="481.98" dur="3.72">largely overseas developments but the</text>
  <text start="484.53" dur="3.42">Fed and the rest of the economic</text>
  <text start="485.7" dur="4.17">establishment for that matter continues</text>
  <text start="487.95" dur="5.94">to ignore the steady steady torrent of</text>
  <text start="489.87" dur="8.01">negative data that shows us that the</text>
  <text start="493.89" dur="6.27">economy is imploding look at</text>
  <text start="497.88" dur="5.75">manufacturing business investment</text>
  <text start="500.16" dur="6.38">productivity consumer confidence numbers</text>
  <text start="503.63" dur="5.349">they&amp;#39;re just ignoring all that and</text>
  <text start="506.54" dur="5.499">they&amp;#39;re pretending that the economy is</text>
  <text start="508.979" dur="5.221">recovering and everything is fine Martin</text>
  <text start="512.039" dur="5.55">Armstrong is out there and he said the</text>
  <text start="514.2" dur="5.88">Federal Reserve yielded to international</text>
  <text start="517.589" dur="6.481">pressure and they&amp;#39;re making the very</text>
  <text start="520.08" dur="6.81">same mistake that it was made in 1927</text>
  <text start="524.07" dur="5.13">back then there was a secret meeting of</text>
  <text start="526.89" dur="4.35">the Fed agreed to lower us rates to try</text>
  <text start="529.2" dur="5.55">to help Europe and thereby deflect</text>
  <text start="531.24" dur="6">capital inflows back to Europe the exact</text>
  <text start="534.75" dur="4.53">opposite unfolded in the aftermath and</text>
  <text start="537.24" dur="5.01">even more money abandoned Europe and</text>
  <text start="539.28" dur="6.96">flow directly into the u.s. share market</text>
  <text start="542.25" dur="6.03">in 1927 the Fed lowered us rates try to</text>
  <text start="546.24" dur="4.5">help Europe which was then in the middle</text>
  <text start="548.28" dur="6.15">of an economic debt crisis which is</text>
  <text start="550.74" dur="5.849">happening today the same exact way it is</text>
  <text start="554.43" dur="4.71">very curious how history repeats itself</text>
  <text start="556.589" dur="5.101">in doing so they are condemning us</text>
  <text start="559.14" dur="4.77">pension funds as well as the elderly to</text>
  <text start="561.69" dur="4.29">financial doom setting in motion the</text>
  <text start="563.91" dur="5.66">next financial crisis</text>
  <text start="565.98" dur="8.52">is we see the same scenario now</text>
  <text start="569.57" dur="9.76">unfolding as it did in 1929 when we had</text>
  <text start="574.5" dur="9.3">the big crash and the Fed they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="579.33" dur="9.9">all credibility the fed itself realizes</text>
  <text start="583.8" dur="8.73">its credibility is fading fast RBS also</text>
  <text start="589.23" dur="5.22">showed as a recent survey of his clients</text>
  <text start="592.53" dur="4.2">a whopping sixty-three percent replied</text>
  <text start="594.45" dur="5.91">that the Fed is losing its credibility</text>
  <text start="596.73" dur="5.46">in other words it is little to lose by</text>
  <text start="600.36" dur="6.51">doing what will erode its credibility</text>
  <text start="602.19" dur="7.02">that much more RBS knows that the price</text>
  <text start="606.87" dur="5.67">action in market today is negative</text>
  <text start="609.21" dur="5.28">suggesting increasing worries according</text>
  <text start="612.54" dur="4.29">to Alberto Gallo the biggest worries are</text>
  <text start="614.49" dur="5.19">the following the first is that by</text>
  <text start="616.83" dur="5.4">keeping rates lower for even longer the</text>
  <text start="619.68" dur="4.5">emerging market imbalances the Fed is</text>
  <text start="622.23" dur="4.44">worrying about will grow even larger</text>
  <text start="624.18" dur="4.05">making it harder to exit stimulus no</text>
  <text start="626.67" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re not going to exit they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="628.23" dur="4.5">to increase stimulus the second is a</text>
  <text start="630.93" dur="3.63">question of the value of forward</text>
  <text start="632.73" dur="4.71">guidance after the Fed has repeatedly</text>
  <text start="634.56" dur="6.6">called for a hike then backed out I mean</text>
  <text start="637.44" dur="6.42">55 times they backed out telling us oh</text>
  <text start="641.16" dur="4.35">no the economy needs to be much stronger</text>
  <text start="643.86" dur="2.76">unemployment needs to be a six percent</text>
  <text start="645.51" dur="2.37">it needs to be at five point eight</text>
  <text start="646.62" dur="3.39">percent it needs to be at five point</text>
  <text start="647.88" dur="4.74">five percent needs to be it four point</text>
  <text start="650.01" dur="4.77">nine percent they keep changing it</text>
  <text start="652.62" dur="5.25">because they know if they raise it it</text>
  <text start="654.78" dur="4.95">will completely collapse the economy the</text>
  <text start="657.87" dur="4.68">third is that the Fed may have limited</text>
  <text start="659.73" dur="5.55">or no ammunition to react to the next</text>
  <text start="662.55" dur="5.31">potential shock I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="665.28" dur="8.19">completely empty at this point they have</text>
  <text start="667.86" dur="9.51">nothing left and this market will come</text>
  <text start="673.47" dur="4.92">down this is why we&amp;#39;ve been saying this</text>
  <text start="677.37" dur="4.35">is why a lot of people are out there</text>
