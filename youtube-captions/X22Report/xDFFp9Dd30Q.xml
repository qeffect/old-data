  <text start="117.58" dur="3.42">that they&amp;#39;re not going to let this</text>
  <text start="119.11" dur="5.459">happen and we know the central bankers</text>
  <text start="121" dur="6.06">they will come back and attack in many</text>
  <text start="124.569" dur="4.201">different ways but we do see many</text>
  <text start="127.06" dur="4.259">countries like Italy France Sweden</text>
  <text start="128.77" dur="3.87">Belgium Poland Germany all saying you</text>
  <text start="131.319" dur="3.421">know something maybe we should have an</text>
  <text start="132.64" dur="5.16">EU referendum maybe we should vote</text>
  <text start="134.74" dur="5.4">ourselves away from the EU remember the</text>
  <text start="137.8" dur="5.549">EU it&amp;#39;s not an elected body it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="140.14" dur="5.34">transparent they do it for themselves</text>
  <text start="143.349" dur="4.441">they do it for the government&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="145.48" dur="5.19">elite and it is the central banking</text>
  <text start="147.79" dur="4.5">system it not designed to benefit the</text>
  <text start="150.67" dur="3.45">people of course this is the illusion</text>
  <text start="152.29" dur="3.66">they give off and we also have to</text>
  <text start="154.12" dur="3.69">remember that they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="155.95" dur="5.31">pushing the idea that the economy is</text>
  <text start="157.81" dur="6.48">falling apart but as we know the private</text>
  <text start="161.26" dur="6.53">western central bank countries</text>
  <text start="164.29" dur="5.759">those economies were hurting already</text>
  <text start="167.79" dur="5.47">with a huge amount of debt throughout</text>
  <text start="170.049" dur="5.58">Europe unemployment is skyrocketing they</text>
  <text start="173.26" dur="5.22">do the same manipulation as the United</text>
  <text start="175.629" dur="5.161">States does and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="178.48" dur="6.179">now is they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="180.79" dur="6.75">possibly can to try to reverse this</text>
  <text start="184.659" dur="4.89">referendum they even are saying that you</text>
  <text start="187.54" dur="3.18">know what let&amp;#39;s look at a second EU</text>
  <text start="189.549" dur="4.02">referendum because the people were a</text>
  <text start="190.72" dur="4.95">little confused during the first one and</text>
  <text start="193.569" dur="3.42">let&amp;#39;s have the second one and they</text>
  <text start="195.67" dur="4.11">already have like two million signatures</text>
  <text start="196.989" dur="6.15">or so to say let&amp;#39;s redo the entire thing</text>
  <text start="199.78" dur="5.01">now of course as we know if this was the</text>
  <text start="203.139" dur="3.061">other way where people said to remain</text>
  <text start="204.79" dur="3.27">and people wanted to redo this</text>
  <text start="206.2" dur="3.39">referendum they&amp;#39;d be set they&amp;#39;d be out</text>
  <text start="208.06" dur="5.069">there saying absolutely not this is not</text>
  <text start="209.59" dur="8.929">going to happen now there might be a</text>
  <text start="213.129" dur="8.491">hurdle in the brexit process because the</text>
  <text start="218.519" dur="6.731">Scottish people and the Irish people</text>
  <text start="221.62" dur="7.89">Northern Ireland they might have the</text>
  <text start="225.25" dur="9.599">ability to veto Britain&amp;#39;s separation</text>
  <text start="229.51" dur="8.25">from the EU and we see coming from Sir</text>
  <text start="234.849" dur="4.681">David whether he thought the Scottish</text>
  <text start="237.76" dur="3.689">Parliament would have to give its</text>
  <text start="239.53" dur="4.59">consent to measure extinguishing the</text>
  <text start="241.449" dur="4.68">application of EU law in Scotland he</text>
  <text start="244.12" dur="4.229">noted that such measures would entail</text>
  <text start="246.129" dur="4.89">amendment of section 29 of scotland act</text>
  <text start="248.349" dur="5.341">1998 which binds the Scottish Parliament</text>
  <text start="251.019" dur="5.31">to act in a manner compatible with EU</text>
  <text start="253.69" dur="4.5">law and he therefore believed that the</text>
  <text start="256.329" dur="5.09">Scottish Parliament consent would be</text>
  <text start="258.19" dur="7.409">required now we see already that</text>
  <text start="261.419" dur="8.381">Scotland is looking to try to push this</text>
  <text start="265.599" dur="7.38">where they block the UK&amp;#39;s exit from the</text>
  <text start="269.8" dur="6.48">EU so we have a second referendum going</text>
  <text start="272.979" dur="5.281">on we have Scotland with their</text>
  <text start="276.28" dur="5.009">Parliament saying eh maybe we can block</text>
  <text start="278.26" dur="4.469">this and these central bankers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="281.289" dur="5.431">going to do whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="282.729" dur="6.78">to completely stop this but we already</text>
  <text start="286.72" dur="5.55">see a domino effect occurring we see</text>
  <text start="289.509" dur="5.22">many countries like France Austria</text>
  <text start="292.27" dur="4.259">Finland Netherlands hungry they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="294.729" dur="3.061">looking to have some type of referendum</text>
  <text start="296.529" dur="4.231">to say you know something me</text>
  <text start="297.79" dur="5.84">we should leave as the UK wants to leave</text>
  <text start="300.76" dur="6.56">now remember nothing has happened so far</text>
  <text start="303.63" dur="6.55">they haven&amp;#39;t left it was a referendum I</text>
  <text start="307.32" dur="4.96">mean David Cameron he said he resigned</text>
  <text start="310.18" dur="7.59">but that&amp;#39;s not that&amp;#39;s not effective</text>
  <text start="312.28" dur="8.13">until October and David Cameron would</text>
  <text start="317.77" dur="7.13">have to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon</text>
  <text start="320.41" dur="8.52">Treaty to make this legally binding and</text>
  <text start="324.9" dur="5.65">we can see right now leaving would</text>
  <text start="328.93" dur="5.55">require Prime Minister David Cameron</text>
  <text start="330.55" dur="5.73">invoking this article 50 now is he going</text>
  <text start="334.48" dur="3.6">to do this because even though he said</text>
  <text start="336.28" dur="5.94">he resigned he&amp;#39;s not leaving until</text>
  <text start="338.08" dur="6.93">October so right now nothing has</text>
  <text start="342.22" dur="4.47">happened we had this referendum and the</text>
  <text start="345.01" dur="3.57">corporate media the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="346.69" dur="4.62">government&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re all out there</text>
  <text start="348.58" dur="4.59">making this a huge deal that everything</text>
  <text start="351.31" dur="3.45">is going to completely come to a</text>
  <text start="353.17" dur="3.36">screeching halt now the only reason it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="354.76" dur="4.14">going to come to a screeching halt it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="356.53" dur="4.68">because the economies were already</text>
  <text start="358.9" dur="4.59">failing we already had this a huge</text>
  <text start="361.21" dur="4.68">amount of debt we already know there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="363.49" dur="4.23">huge amount of unemployment we know from</text>
  <text start="365.89" dur="4.29">all the economic indicators that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="367.72" dur="4.32">been looking at the economy has been</text>
  <text start="370.18" dur="4.26">collapsing there has been no improvement</text>
  <text start="372.04" dur="5.67">whatsoever the only improvement has been</text>
  <text start="374.44" dur="5.25">the bubbles in the economy now they can</text>
  <text start="377.71" dur="4.07">make the case at this point saying that</text>
  <text start="379.69" dur="5.1">because of what the people have done</text>
  <text start="381.78" dur="5.26">this is why the economy is failing and</text>
  <text start="384.79" dur="5.28">we&amp;#39;re already starting to see this</text>
  <text start="387.04" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re talking about recession they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="390.07" dur="4.68">talking about war they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="392.5" dur="4.05">how this economy will not be able to</text>
  <text start="394.75" dur="6.06">survive now they&amp;#39;re doing this and</text>
  <text start="396.55" dur="5.91">playing this up to explain away why this</text>
  <text start="400.81" dur="3.87">is how to remember they don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="402.46" dur="5.43">blamed for any of this and we already</text>
  <text start="404.68" dur="6.15">knew that war we already knew that the</text>
  <text start="407.89" dur="7.47">economic collapse was already on its way</text>
  <text start="410.83" dur="7.05">and they&amp;#39;re going to use all of this to</text>
  <text start="415.36" dur="4.14">blame it on the people and once they</text>
  <text start="417.88" dur="4.65">blame it on the people they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="419.5" dur="4.98">say oh this country cyber attacked this</text>
  <text start="422.53" dur="4.02">person or this group did a physical</text>
  <text start="424.48" dur="4.59">attack and you can see how this can play</text>
  <text start="426.55" dur="4.89">out here now Moody&amp;#39;s has already come</text>
  <text start="429.07" dur="6.93">out saying that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="431.44" dur="6.36">to downgrade Britain because of what</text>
  <text start="436" dur="4.65">just happened so their credit credit</text>
  <text start="437.8" dur="6.45">worthiness is at greater risk right now</text>
  <text start="440.65" dur="7.35">if they leave the European Union we also</text>
  <text start="444.25" dur="8.67">know that the TTP the TTIP and the rest</text>
  <text start="448" dur="7.35">of these illegal trade deals they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="452.92" dur="4.77">jeopardy right now but something very</text>
  <text start="455.35" dur="3.81">interesting the UN&amp;#39;s independent expert</text>
  <text start="457.69" dur="4.5">on the promotion of democratic and</text>
  <text start="459.16" dur="4.56">equitable international order is assign</text>
  <text start="462.19" dur="3.93">the task to apply the standards of</text>
  <text start="463.72" dur="4.95">international law to propose treaties to</text>
  <text start="466.12" dur="4.41">turn to determine whether they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="468.67" dur="6.93">accord with international law now on</text>
  <text start="470.53" dur="7.77">Friday he issued his finding his</text>
  <text start="475.6" dur="5.61">findings on three large proposed</text>
  <text start="478.3" dur="8.69">treaties that TTIP the tisa and the seta</text>
  <text start="481.21" dur="12.84">and he also said back on februari second</text>
  <text start="486.99" dur="10.12">that when he looked at these these trade</text>
  <text start="494.05" dur="7.59">deals these treaties between these</text>
  <text start="497.11" dur="8.42">countries he said that they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="501.64" dur="7.23">violation of international law and is</text>
  <text start="505.53" dur="6.16">inconsistent with democracy and on his</text>
  <text start="508.87" dur="6.75">Friday ruling he came out and said yes</text>
  <text start="511.69" dur="7.349">that still stands he went through all of</text>
  <text start="515.62" dur="5.31">it and he said his findings regarding</text>
  <text start="519.039" dur="4.651">the proposed Atlantic treaties condemned</text>
  <text start="520.93" dur="5.46">them by saying trade deals prepared and</text>
  <text start="523.69" dur="4.32">negotiated in secret excluding key</text>
  <text start="526.39" dur="3.6">stakeholders such as labor unions</text>
  <text start="528.01" dur="4.46">consumer associations health</text>
  <text start="529.99" dur="6.57">professionals environmental experts</text>
  <text start="532.47" dur="8.89">Parliament&amp;#39;s the people and having zero</text>
  <text start="536.56" dur="7.89">democratic legitimacy guess what these</text>
  <text start="541.36" dur="7.08">are in violation of international law he</text>
  <text start="544.45" dur="6.84">further said disenfranchising the public</text>
  <text start="548.44" dur="5.94">from participating in this important</text>
  <text start="551.29" dur="6.92">debate is undemocratic and manifests a</text>
  <text start="554.38" dur="7.11">profound disregard to people&amp;#39;s voices</text>
  <text start="558.21" dur="5.14">he&amp;#39;s absolutely right and especially in</text>
  <text start="561.49" dur="3.569">this country called the United States</text>
  <text start="563.35" dur="4.379">where they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="565.059" dur="4.95">parent we have freedom we have democracy</text>
  <text start="567.729" dur="6.09">again we look at our leaders and what do</text>
  <text start="570.009" dur="5.46">we see we see the opposite happening now</text>
  <text start="573.819" dur="4.77">Google YouTube Facebook and other social</text>
  <text start="575.469" dur="6.21">media they are out there and they are</text>
  <text start="578.589" dur="6.15">now starting to block any type of</text>
  <text start="581.679" dur="6.42">extremist content and they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="584.739" dur="5.66">using an automated process now basically</text>
  <text start="588.099" dur="5.58">what they&amp;#39;re doing is censoring content</text>
  <text start="590.399" dur="4.83">youtube facebook they&amp;#39;re among the sites</text>
  <text start="593.679" dur="4.02">deploying the system to block and</text>
  <text start="595.229" dur="3.64">rapidly take down anything that of</text>
  <text start="597.699" dur="3.21">course that has to do with the Islamic</text>
  <text start="598.869" dur="4.34">state anything that has to do with</text>
  <text start="600.909" dur="6.36">extremism anything that has to do with</text>
  <text start="603.209" dur="6.13">maybe anti-government now the technology</text>
  <text start="607.269" dur="5.76">employed that was originally developed</text>
  <text start="609.339" dur="5.61">for copyright protected content and it</text>
  <text start="613.029" dur="6.81">looks at like hashes unique digital</text>
  <text start="614.949" dur="7.89">fingerprints and it assigns the videos a</text>
  <text start="619.839" dur="5.88">specific algorithm it looks at the</text>
  <text start="622.839" dur="7.98">content and matches some fingerprints</text>
  <text start="625.719" dur="7.98">and if all this matches up they flag it</text>
  <text start="630.819" dur="5.16">as offensive they take it down now are</text>
  <text start="633.699" dur="3.72">there any humans looking at this at this</text>
  <text start="635.979" dur="6.21">point we don&amp;#39;t know we don&amp;#39;t think so</text>
  <text start="637.419" dur="6.81">and we see right now that government and</text>
  <text start="642.189" dur="7.32">private industry will decide what</text>
  <text start="644.229" dur="7.53">content you will see what is and is not</text>
  <text start="649.509" dur="7.56">allowable will be decided by a closed</text>
  <text start="651.759" dur="9.71">process and will be automated very</text>
  <text start="657.069" dur="8.22">interesting so they&amp;#39;re going to decide</text>
  <text start="661.469" dur="5.56">what we can and cannot see now since</text>
  <text start="665.289" dur="4.14">content removed equals content</text>
  <text start="667.029" dur="5.1">prohibited you&amp;#39;ll never know what you</text>
  <text start="669.429" dur="5.61">can&amp;#39;t see the obvious live real slope is</text>
  <text start="672.129" dur="5.85">in a decision about what is extremist</text>
  <text start="675.039" dur="5.79">and what is legitimate free political</text>
  <text start="677.979" dur="5.31">speech that while offensive has a right</text>
  <text start="680.829" dur="6.18">to be heard and a place in the market of</text>
  <text start="683.289" dur="9.39">ideas and I&amp;#39;ve said this before free</text>
  <text start="687.009" dur="8.91">speech is any group any people speaking</text>
  <text start="692.679" dur="5.911">their minds once the government wants</text>
  <text start="695.919" dur="6.091">private bodies get involved</text>
  <text start="698.59" dur="5.49">is limited speech this is permitted</text>
  <text start="702.01" dur="5.61">speech and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="704.08" dur="5.43">right now now Europe is out there and</text>
  <text start="707.62" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re pushing the idea that we need</text>
  <text start="709.51" dur="4.44">some type of European army right now to</text>
  <text start="711.97" dur="3.99">bring the rest of the European countries</text>
