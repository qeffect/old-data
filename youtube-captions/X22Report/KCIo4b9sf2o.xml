  <text start="53.27" dur="5.07">hi and welcome you listening to the X we</text>
  <text start="56.75" dur="5.01">need to report my name is Dave and this</text>
  <text start="58.34" dur="6.3">is episode 1295 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.76" dur="5.76">June 1st 2017 and the plot of the</text>
  <text start="64.64" dur="4.83">episode is the economy is imploding so</text>
  <text start="67.52" dur="5.04">quickly that it&amp;#39;s time to think about</text>
  <text start="69.47" dur="5.49">preparing let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="72.56" dur="4.35">collapse financial news now we are</text>
  <text start="74.96" dur="3.93">getting more and more statistical</text>
  <text start="76.91" dur="4.65">numbers that are coming out telling us</text>
  <text start="78.89" dur="4.47">how great the economy is doing and this</text>
  <text start="81.56" dur="4.8">is being done on purpose because we have</text>
  <text start="83.36" dur="5.67">to remember that the central bank the</text>
  <text start="86.36" dur="4.98">deep state they&amp;#39;re still controlling a</text>
  <text start="89.03" dur="4.5">huge portion of the government</text>
  <text start="91.34" dur="4.559">especially where all these stats are</text>
  <text start="93.53" dur="5.16">coming from and what doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="95.899" dur="5.671">is that even though ADP is putting out</text>
  <text start="98.69" dur="4.77">information their information really</text>
  <text start="101.57" dur="4.79">doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="103.46" dur="5.939">for instance they came out with their</text>
  <text start="106.36" dur="5.71">employment statistical information today</text>
  <text start="109.399" dur="4.47">and they&amp;#39;re saying wow the economy looks</text>
  <text start="112.07" dur="5.43">great we added about two hundred and</text>
  <text start="113.869" dur="5.221">fifty three thousand jobs for May and we</text>
  <text start="117.5" dur="3.69">could see that after April which</text>
  <text start="119.09" dur="3.96">completely plunged it looks like</text>
  <text start="121.19" dur="4.59">everything is right back on track and</text>
  <text start="123.05" dur="6.15">the economy is strong and doing well</text>
  <text start="125.78" dur="6.69">well challenger graying Christmas which</text>
  <text start="129.2" dur="5.4">tracks job cuts people being laid off</text>
  <text start="132.47" dur="4.83">they have a completely different story</text>
  <text start="134.6" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;re saying that there was a 71</text>
  <text start="137.3" dur="7.97">percent jump in job year-on-year</text>
  <text start="140.48" dur="8.49">in May and something doesn&amp;#39;t seem right</text>
  <text start="145.27" dur="6.82">with the job numbers coming out from ADP</text>
  <text start="148.97" dur="6">compared to what is actually happening</text>
  <text start="152.09" dur="6.24">in the job market now we know there were</text>
  <text start="154.97" dur="6.39">a lot of retail stores that were closing</text>
  <text start="158.33" dur="5.1">which are closing this just doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="161.36" dur="4.41">affect the part-time people there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="163.43" dur="4.77">lot of full-time people that do work in</text>
  <text start="165.77" dur="5.67">these stores and we can see that</text>
  <text start="168.2" dur="6.42">something again does not make sense and</text>
  <text start="171.44" dur="6.09">if you notice the ADP stats normally</text>
  <text start="174.62" dur="5.07">drive with the BLS they&amp;#39;re very very</text>
  <text start="177.53" dur="4.86">close so when we look at this we could</text>
  <text start="179.69" dur="4.92">see that something is not exactly right</text>
  <text start="182.39" dur="4.02">now we&amp;#39;re starting to see a lot of</text>
  <text start="184.61" dur="2.55">retail stores well they&amp;#39;re just coming</text>
  <text start="186.41" dur="3.21">out and saying hey</text>
  <text start="187.16" dur="5.19">listen we&amp;#39;re closing down RadioShack</text>
  <text start="189.62" dur="5.94">well they&amp;#39;ve closed more than a thousand</text>
  <text start="192.35" dur="7.68">stores since Memorial Day weekend they</text>
  <text start="195.56" dur="7.65">have 72 company owned stores remaining I</text>
  <text start="200.03" dur="6.3">mean think about this Michael Kors is</text>
  <text start="203.21" dur="6.69">closing a hundred twenty-five stores as</text>
  <text start="206.33" dur="5.85">sales are collapsing I remember about a</text>
  <text start="209.9" dur="5.13">year ago when they had reports saying</text>
  <text start="212.18" dur="6.45">how great Michael Kors was do and now</text>
  <text start="215.03" dur="6.63">all of a sudden sales are collapsing or</text>
  <text start="218.63" dur="5.07">were they always collapsing and this was</text>
  <text start="221.66" dur="3.72">just a way of making everyone think that</text>
  <text start="223.7" dur="3.74">everything was fine because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="225.38" dur="4.65">starting to realize things are</text>
  <text start="227.44" dur="4.81">dramatically changing in the economy and</text>
  <text start="230.03" dur="3.84">a bank well they went out and they</text>
  <text start="232.25" dur="3.42">looked at all the moles they looked at</text>
  <text start="233.87" dur="4.74">all the stores and they made a forecast</text>
  <text start="235.67" dur="4.59">that a quarter of all malls they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="238.61" dur="4.35">going to be closing down in the next</text>
  <text start="240.26" dur="5.81">five years I mean think about this for a</text>
  <text start="242.96" dur="4.32">second we&amp;#39;re barely a quarter into 2017</text>
  <text start="246.07" dur="3.64">year-to-date</text>
  <text start="247.28" dur="7.23">retail closings have already surpassed</text>
  <text start="249.71" dur="6.21">those of 2008 and the estimated this</text>
  <text start="254.51" dur="3.75">coming from credit Swit they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="255.92" dur="3.569">estimating if we keep on this track by</text>
  <text start="258.26" dur="3.09">the end of this year there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="259.489" dur="5.311">eight thousand six hundred and forty</text>
  <text start="261.35" dur="7.26">stores that will close which will be</text>
  <text start="264.8" dur="7.47">higher than the historical 2008 peak of</text>
  <text start="268.61" dur="5.4">approximately 62 hundred stores so wait</text>
  <text start="272.27" dur="5.97">a minute this recovery that we&amp;#39;re in is</text>
  <text start="274.01" dur="6.45">own to have more stores closing than</text>
  <text start="278.24" dur="4.02">when we were in the Great Recession and</text>
  <text start="280.46" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us that</text>
  <text start="282.26" dur="5.73">everything is fun and remember online</text>
  <text start="284.72" dur="6.41">sales only makes up around eight to</text>
  <text start="287.99" dur="6.06">eight and a half percent of retail sales</text>
  <text start="291.13" dur="5.58">yes will that be increasing over time of</text>
  <text start="294.05" dur="6.869">course it will be but right now</text>
  <text start="296.71" dur="6.31">something is dramatically wrong and we</text>
  <text start="300.919" dur="4.231">can see right now the square footage in</text>
  <text start="303.02" dur="4.17">all these malls and all these strip</text>
  <text start="305.15" dur="4.56">malls well that&amp;#39;s going to increase</text>
  <text start="307.19" dur="4.56">dramatically and if we look we can see</text>
  <text start="309.71" dur="3.27">right now there&amp;#39;s approximately about 49</text>
  <text start="311.75" dur="2.64">million square feet of retail space</text>
  <text start="312.98" dur="3.99">which is close year-to-date</text>
  <text start="314.39" dur="3.99">and should this pace process which it</text>
  <text start="316.97" dur="2.88">will because there&amp;#39;s a lot more stores</text>
  <text start="318.38" dur="2.68">that are closing there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="319.85" dur="3.22">about 140</text>
  <text start="321.06" dur="6">million square feet that are going to be</text>
  <text start="323.07" dur="6.3">on the market this again is surpassing</text>
  <text start="327.06" dur="6.12">the historical peak of a hundred and</text>
  <text start="329.37" dur="6.299">fifteen million retail square feet back</text>
  <text start="333.18" dur="6">in 2001 and that&amp;#39;s when we had another</text>
  <text start="335.669" dur="5.671">recession so we have 1,100 u.s. shopping</text>
  <text start="339.18" dur="4.53">malls out of this 1,100 u.s. shopping</text>
  <text start="341.34" dur="3.99">malls twenty to twenty-five percent of</text>
  <text start="343.71" dur="7.2">them well they&amp;#39;re going to be shutting</text>
  <text start="345.33" dur="9.36">down we have about 220 and 275 shopping</text>
  <text start="350.91" dur="6">centers about 20 to 25% of those will be</text>
  <text start="354.69" dur="5.01">shutting down within the next five years</text>
  <text start="356.91" dur="6.21">this is going to send a shock wave</text>
  <text start="359.7" dur="6.51">within the US retail and mall sector and</text>
  <text start="363.12" dur="4.799">we can see it&amp;#39;s already starting now we</text>
  <text start="366.21" dur="4.83">know there&amp;#39;s a lot of stores that are in</text>
  <text start="367.919" dur="5.761">trouble on June first Gymboree this is a</text>
  <text start="371.04" dur="5.01">children&amp;#39;s clothing retailer they will</text>
  <text start="373.68" dur="4.23">face an interest payment on its debt</text>
  <text start="376.05" dur="3.96">they will not be able to make this</text>
  <text start="377.91" dur="4.14">payment so it looks like they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="380.01" dur="2.76">to declare bankruptcy we know on May</text>
  <text start="382.05" dur="2.88">25th</text>
  <text start="382.77" dur="4.95">Sears Holding announced that quarterly</text>
  <text start="384.93" dur="5.67">sales had plunged another 20% going back</text>
  <text start="387.72" dur="5.85">to May 15th rue 21 filed for bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="390.6" dur="5.819">May 11th Marsh grocery store chain in</text>
  <text start="393.57" dur="6.03">Indiana and Ohio they filed for chapter</text>
  <text start="396.419" dur="5.851">11 bankruptcy they operated about 116</text>
  <text start="399.6" dur="4.89">supermarkets at 154 convenience stores</text>
  <text start="402.27" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re down to 67 stores now</text>
  <text start="404.49" dur="6.27">on May 4th central grocers filed for</text>
  <text start="408.06" dur="4.47">bankruptcy protection because they could</text>
  <text start="410.76" dur="4.71">make their payments to General Mills</text>
  <text start="412.53" dur="6.3">coca-cola and they started to close down</text>
  <text start="415.47" dur="7.44">their establishment and this goes on and</text>
  <text start="418.83" dur="6.149">on and on which tells us we are in big</text>
  <text start="422.91" dur="5.7">trouble now when we look at the auto</text>
  <text start="424.979" dur="6.901">sector this whole thing was being</text>
  <text start="428.61" dur="6.09">propped up by one gigantic illusion</text>
  <text start="431.88" dur="4.62">called channel stuffing where the auto</text>
  <text start="434.7" dur="3.63">manufacturers were produced as many cars</text>
  <text start="436.5" dur="4.02">as they possibly could and then they</text>
  <text start="438.33" dur="4.44">would stuff them into dealership Lots</text>
  <text start="440.52" dur="4.35">now every time they brought a car into</text>
  <text start="442.77" dur="3.39">the dealership lop that was considered a</text>
  <text start="444.87" dur="4.019">sale even though they didn&amp;#39;t make a sale</text>
  <text start="446.16" dur="5.879">to a customer so they base the sales off</text>
  <text start="448.889" dur="5.851">of that manufacturing was based off of</text>
  <text start="452.039" dur="5.721">how many cars they produced</text>
  <text start="454.74" dur="6.18">now what we&amp;#39;re looking at is that the</text>
  <text start="457.76" dur="7.33">channel stuffing that GM is reporting</text>
  <text start="460.92" dur="9.42">the inventory has hit the highest amount</text>
  <text start="465.09" dur="8.22">since November of 2007 so GM they just</text>
  <text start="470.34" dur="5.49">reported their May results which are not</text>
  <text start="473.31" dur="4.26">very good at all and they were down by</text>
  <text start="475.83" dur="3.47">1.3 percent now they thought they were</text>
  <text start="477.57" dur="4.32">going to have a rise of 4.3 percent</text>
  <text start="479.3" dur="4.75">remember the sales are based on how many</text>
  <text start="481.89" dur="5.22">cars they Channel stuff into these Lots</text>
  <text start="484.05" dur="6.12">well if the lots are full they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="487.11" dur="3.75">stuff them any more but there&amp;#39;s a bigger</text>
  <text start="490.17" dur="3.9">problem here</text>
  <text start="490.86" dur="5.34">GM revealed in its delivery report which</text>
  <text start="494.07" dur="5.55">disclosed a whopping nine hundred and</text>
  <text start="496.2" dur="6.29">sixty three thousand units in dealer</text>
  <text start="499.62" dur="6.47">inventory at the end of May up nearly</text>
  <text start="502.49" dur="6.82">30,000 from the past month representing</text>
  <text start="506.09" dur="3.55">101 days of supply so what does this all</text>
  <text start="509.31" dur="4.11">mean</text>
  <text start="509.64" dur="6.42">well GM and their channel stuffing it</text>
  <text start="513.42" dur="4.53">just hit an all-time high with the</text>
  <text start="516.06" dur="4.44">number of GM vehicles parked at dealer</text>
  <text start="517.95" dur="5.19">Lots where they are waiting for someone</text>
  <text start="520.5" dur="6.48">to come and buy them now we saw this</text>
  <text start="523.14" dur="7.83">happen right before the recession where</text>
  <text start="526.98" dur="6.81">the Lots were filled with automobiles no</text>
  <text start="530.97" dur="6.12">one was coming to buy them inventory hit</text>
  <text start="533.79" dur="5.28">a high and then we went into a recession</text>
  <text start="537.09" dur="4.29">and we&amp;#39;re seeing that we&amp;#39;re following</text>
  <text start="539.07" dur="4.62">the same exact path for it is out there</text>
  <text start="541.38" dur="5.22">and they say their fleet sales they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="543.69" dur="5.01">going to be falling 15 percent in June</text>
  <text start="546.6" dur="3.72">so when we start to look at all the</text>
  <text start="548.7" dur="3.9">economic indicators and we look at all</text>
  <text start="550.32" dur="6.15">this data we can see that the economy is</text>
  <text start="552.6" dur="6.3">not improving whatsoever actually it is</text>
  <text start="556.47" dur="5.16">getting worse as we continue on through</text>
  <text start="558.9" dur="6.74">this year now us construction spending</text>
  <text start="561.63" dur="8.46">it completely plunged in April down by</text>
  <text start="565.64" dur="6.55">1.4 percent this is the third worst drop</text>
  <text start="570.09" dur="4.26">in construction spending in six years</text>
  <text start="572.19" dur="4.02">now we know new home sales they&amp;#39;re down</text>
  <text start="574.35" dur="4.83">existing home sales they are down</text>
  <text start="576.21" dur="4.47">pending home sales they are down and the</text>
  <text start="579.18" dur="4.38">last time US construction spending</text>
  <text start="580.68" dur="5.46">plunge like this global central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="583.56" dur="4.22">unleashed a coordinated buying program</text>
  <text start="586.14" dur="5.57">to save the war</text>
  <text start="587.78" dur="6.42">yes back in 2008 when we hit the Great</text>
  <text start="591.71" dur="5.66">Recession so we could see right now</text>
  <text start="594.2" dur="6.06">things are not looking good whatsoever</text>
  <text start="597.37" dur="6.7">we also see that US manufacturing PMI</text>
  <text start="600.26" dur="6.68">they have dropped to 8 month lows in May</text>
  <text start="604.07" dur="5.76">there&amp;#39;s the sales are very sluggish</text>
  <text start="606.94" dur="5.74">firms are scaling back right now</text>
  <text start="609.83" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re not hiring individuals and I</text>
  <text start="612.68" dur="5">know Trump was out there talking about</text>
  <text start="614.42" dur="6.72">you know how great the economy&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="617.68" dur="4.99">how many jobs are going to be added how</text>
  <text start="621.14" dur="3.99">many manufacturers are going to be</text>
  <text start="622.67" dur="5.34">coming back to the United States this is</text>
  <text start="625.13" dur="6">not going to happen in this economy all</text>
  <text start="628.01" dur="6.86">of this is being prepped and prepared</text>
  <text start="631.13" dur="7.38">for one once this system completely</text>
  <text start="634.87" dur="5.86">deteriorates and collapses and we can</text>
  <text start="638.51" dur="4.35">see right now this is exactly where</text>
  <text start="640.73" dur="6.84">we&amp;#39;re headed at this point we&amp;#39;re headed</text>
  <text start="642.86" dur="7.5">into a major collapse scenario now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="647.57" dur="5.07">very interesting we see that Europe they</text>
  <text start="650.36" dur="6.15">have many many problems right now the EU</text>
  <text start="652.64" dur="5.55">they are in trouble UK is leaving they</text>
  <text start="656.51" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t want them to leave other countries</text>
  <text start="658.19" dur="4.68">would like to leave and they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="660.65" dur="4.47">all the different countries listen you</text>
  <text start="662.87" dur="4.32">need to pay if you want to leave and you</text>
  <text start="665.12" dur="4.76">have to meet all our demands if you want</text>
  <text start="667.19" dur="6.09">to leave now Soros was out there and</text>
  <text start="669.88" dur="7.06">he&amp;#39;s saying that the European Union is</text>
  <text start="673.28" dur="5.43">now in an existential crisis he warned</text>
  <text start="676.94" dur="4.26">that the single currency area had become</text>
  <text start="678.71" dur="4.83">the exact opposite of what it was</text>
  <text start="681.2" dur="4.74">originally intended and that was to take</text>
  <text start="683.54" dur="7.08">control of Europe have a one currency</text>
  <text start="685.94" dur="6.93">and the non elected leaders would sit on</text>
  <text start="690.62" dur="5.07">top of these sovereign governments and</text>
  <text start="692.87" dur="6.36">they would call the shots that&amp;#39;s what he</text>
  <text start="695.69" dur="7.44">really means and he says that the EU is</text>
  <text start="699.23" dur="6.78">now surrounded by hostile powers and he</text>

  <text start="716.81" dur="4.38">and Putin and we could see at this point</text>
  <text start="719.39" dur="5.31">that the deep state</text>
  <text start="721.19" dur="5.22">they are in trouble they see everything</text>
  <text start="724.7" dur="3.57">that they have done over the many many</text>
  <text start="726.41" dur="5.1">years and the plans that they wanted to</text>
  <text start="728.27" dur="4.62">have going forward it is all starting to</text>
  <text start="731.51" dur="4.17">fall apart</text>
  <text start="732.89" dur="4.98">the economies of the world are starting</text>
  <text start="735.68" dur="6.45">to fall apart people are going to</text>
  <text start="737.87" dur="6.66">realize and recognize that they had the</text>
  <text start="742.13" dur="5.49">economies for all these years they put</text>
  <text start="744.53" dur="6.29">us into trillions and trillions worth of</text>
  <text start="747.62" dur="5.97">debt they made countries implement</text>

  <text start="764.57" dur="3.9">point the finger at the deep state</text>
  <text start="766.79" dur="2.4">they&amp;#39;re going to point the finger at the</text>
  <text start="768.47" dur="3.93">central bank</text>
  <text start="769.19" dur="6.75">because they&amp;#39;re going to realize that</text>
  <text start="772.4" dur="6.66">after all these years what do we have to</text>
  <text start="775.94" dur="6.36">show for this a collapse of the system a</text>
  <text start="779.06" dur="5.61">huge amount of debt a lot of people out</text>
  <text start="782.3" dur="5.43">of work a lot of businesses that have</text>
  <text start="784.67" dur="6.63">closed a lot of stores that have closed</text>
  <text start="787.73" dur="6">and economies that have to be completely</text>
  <text start="791.3" dur="5.48">restarted by one getting rid of the</text>
  <text start="793.73" dur="7.25">central bank to wiping out all the debt</text>
  <text start="796.78" dur="7.6">three well getting some type of currency</text>
  <text start="800.98" dur="6.67">where there&amp;#39;s checks and balances where</text>
  <text start="804.38" dur="7.38">central banks governments cannot just</text>
  <text start="807.65" dur="7.14">print or create currency out of thin air</text>
  <text start="811.76" dur="5.49">and not be responsible for what is</text>
  <text start="814.79" dur="5.04">happening so when we look at everything</text>
  <text start="817.25" dur="4.47">right now we see that the economy well</text>
  <text start="819.83" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s not getting better it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="821.72" dur="4.83">worse and worse as time goes on in each</text>
  <text start="824.06" dur="5.22">time we report on this we can see that</text>
  <text start="826.55" dur="7.11">it is not improving jobs aren&amp;#39;t coming</text>
  <text start="829.28" dur="6.75">back we don&amp;#39;t have this magical job</text>
  <text start="833.66" dur="4.92">creation that everyone thought was going</text>
  <text start="836.03" dur="5.19">to happen we&amp;#39;re not seeing manufacturers</text>
  <text start="838.58" dur="4.62">build these manufacturing plants because</text>
  <text start="841.22" dur="4.95">what we need to do first is get rid of</text>
  <text start="843.2" dur="4.5">the system the system needs to crash and</text>
  <text start="846.17" dur="3.6">it looks like we&amp;#39;re approaching that</text>
  <text start="847.7" dur="4.08">period of time right now and what</text>
  <text start="849.77" dur="5.04">everyone needs to do and understand is</text>
  <text start="851.78" dur="6.24">that when this system falls apart</text>
  <text start="854.81" dur="5.91">Bart you need to be ready now everyone</text>
  <text start="858.02" dur="5.009">looks at China and says wow China has</text>
  <text start="860.72" dur="3.54">been using the fiat currency they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="863.029" dur="2.881">been building roads they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="864.26" dur="3.42">building bridges they&amp;#39;ve been building</text>
  <text start="865.91" dur="4.53">all these different things they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="867.68" dur="4.47">using the system and they understand</text>
  <text start="870.44" dur="5.37">that the system&amp;#39;s not going to last much</text>
  <text start="872.15" dur="6.21">longer while they were doing that using</text>
  <text start="875.81" dur="3.66">this paper which they know is going to</text>
  <text start="878.36" dur="4.44">completely disappear</text>
  <text start="879.47" dur="6.24">they were stacking gold and they were</text>
  <text start="882.8" dur="5.1">basically bringing in as much gold as</text>
  <text start="885.71" dur="4.379">possible so it was Russia because they</text>
  <text start="887.9" dur="6.09">understood and they knew that if they</text>
  <text start="890.089" dur="5.761">use all this paper currency under the</text>
  <text start="893.99" dur="4.289">system that were under today they can</text>
  <text start="895.85" dur="5.46">build all these things for free and have</text>
  <text start="898.279" dur="5.761">an incredible infrastructure because</text>
  <text start="901.31" dur="5.34">when the in system restarts they have an</text>
  <text start="904.04" dur="4.98">insurance policy and that is gold and</text>
  <text start="906.65" dur="5.07">they have their infrastructures already</text>
  <text start="909.02" dur="5.069">built and we know that all this debt</text>
  <text start="911.72" dur="4.68">everything that we see today well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="914.089" dur="5.671">going to disappear the currency that we</text>
  <text start="916.4" dur="5.82">have today is going to disappear and the</text>
  <text start="919.76" dur="5.07">wealth of people it&amp;#39;s going to disappear</text>
  <text start="922.22" dur="5.55">this is why people been saying if gold</text>
  <text start="924.83" dur="5.28">or silver make sure that you&amp;#39;re prepared</text>
  <text start="927.77" dur="3.45">with food water and supplies because</text>
  <text start="930.11" dur="3.84">we&amp;#39;re going to go through this period of</text>
  <text start="931.22" dur="6">time where things are going to be very</text>
  <text start="933.95" dur="7.16">very crazy now this almost occurred back</text>
  <text start="937.22" dur="6.14">in 2008 but they stopped it by creating</text>
  <text start="941.11" dur="4.63">trillions and trillions of dollars</text>
  <text start="943.36" dur="5.56">basically it was like giving a drug</text>
  <text start="945.74" dur="4.92">addict more drugs and that only lasts</text>
  <text start="948.92" dur="4.02">for a long time until the drug addict</text>
  <text start="950.66" dur="4.5">actually crashes them and dies that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="952.94" dur="4.32">what&amp;#39;s happening right now the drug</text>
  <text start="955.16" dur="4.44">addict which is the countries they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="957.26" dur="5.19">dying they&amp;#39;re going to crash because</text>
  <text start="959.6" dur="4.62">they pumped in so much stimulus there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="962.45" dur="3.84">nothing left this is why they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="964.22" dur="4.41">about universal basic income because</text>
  <text start="966.29" dur="3.81">this is the last thing they have just</text>
  <text start="968.63" dur="3.09">give the people the money well where&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="970.1" dur="3.84">the money coming from where&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="971.72" dur="5.16">currency coming from it doesn&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="973.94" dur="4.92">from nowhere it comes from the central</text>
  <text start="976.88" dur="3.57">bank and the central bank is just not</text>
  <text start="978.86" dur="4.74">going to keep it out freely and say here</text>
  <text start="980.45" dur="5.1">you go no they attach interest to that</text>
  <text start="983.6" dur="5.13">and they let the government borrow it</text>
  <text start="985.55" dur="6.84">and those people receiving that currency</text>
  <text start="988.73" dur="7.17">they owe on that currency and that traps</text>
  <text start="992.39" dur="5.7">them even further and as they pump and</text>
  <text start="995.9" dur="4.26">let&amp;#39;s say they pump all this currency</text>
  <text start="998.09" dur="4.53">into the system where everyone&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="1000.16" dur="5.1">a basic income well that&amp;#39;s a lot more</text>
  <text start="1002.62" dur="3.93">dollars in the system that means you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1005.26" dur="3.29">going to see inflation that means the</text>
  <text start="1006.55" dur="4.83">value of the dollar decreases and</text>
  <text start="1008.55" dur="4.99">continually decreases until it&amp;#39;s worth</text>
  <text start="1011.38" dur="5.43">absolutely nothing and then the whole</text>
  <text start="1013.54" dur="6.03">thing is done there&amp;#39;s nothing left for</text>
  <text start="1016.81" dur="7.02">them to do that&amp;#39;s why everything is</text>
  <text start="1019.57" dur="7.59">falling apart so quickly it&amp;#39;s time to</text>
  <text start="1023.83" dur="7.83">get prepared it&amp;#39;s time to make sure that</text>
  <text start="1027.16" dur="7.98">you can sustain you and your family and</text>
  <text start="1031.66" dur="6.39">your friends it&amp;#39;s time for you to become</text>

  <text start="1039.61" dur="4.14">documents they&amp;#39;re going to take your</text>
  <text start="1041.8" dur="3.72">currency just like they did in Cyprus if</text>
  <text start="1043.75" dur="5.25">you think it&amp;#39;s not going to happen</text>
