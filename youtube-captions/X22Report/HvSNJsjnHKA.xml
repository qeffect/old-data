  <text start="57.21" dur="6.809">its own at this point so we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="60.15" dur="5.67">the beginnings of what&amp;#39;s to come and</text>

  <text start="65.82" dur="4.89">we go into this summer into the fall</text>
  <text start="68.13" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s going to get worse and worse and</text>
  <text start="70.71" dur="3.75">what we&amp;#39;re seeing now in the economy</text>
  <text start="72.69" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;re seeing the illusion that the</text>
  <text start="74.46" dur="5.19">United States is continually putting out</text>
  <text start="76.11" dur="8.43">there and it does not make any sense at</text>
  <text start="79.65" dur="8.61">all anymore the illusion is gone it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="84.54" dur="6.78">being ripped apart the reality of the</text>
  <text start="88.26" dur="6.69">economic recession / depression /</text>
  <text start="91.32" dur="6.12">collapse it&amp;#39;s rearing its ugly head the</text>
  <text start="94.95" dur="4.47">illusion is going in the opposite</text>
  <text start="97.44" dur="5.07">direction and no one is following it at</text>
  <text start="99.42" dur="7.17">this time we are seeing that layoffs</text>
  <text start="102.51" dur="7.29">well they&amp;#39;re surging the is M surveys</text>
  <text start="106.59" dur="5.19">are slumping earnings are collapsing and</text>
  <text start="109.8" dur="4.71">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the initial</text>
  <text start="111.78" dur="5.43">jobless claims well they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="114.51" dur="4.32">begin to catch up to reality they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="117.21" dur="3.06">starting to move up that doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="118.83" dur="4.86">that the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="120.27" dur="7.2">might try to push them back down but</text>
  <text start="123.69" dur="5.97">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that we get</text>
  <text start="127.47" dur="4.56">information from challenger gray &amp;amp;</text>
  <text start="129.66" dur="4.68">christmas now they track the layoffs and</text>
  <text start="132.03" dur="5.94">we can see that initial jobless claims</text>
  <text start="134.34" dur="5.72">it doesn&amp;#39;t fit the pattern of the amount</text>
  <text start="137.97" dur="4.53">of layoffs that challenger gray is</text>
  <text start="140.06" dur="6.16">tracking and if we look at these</text>
  <text start="142.5" dur="6.06">services employment it is also going in</text>
  <text start="146.22" dur="5.189">the opposite direction of the initial</text>
  <text start="148.56" dur="5.459">jobless claims if we look at the US</text>
  <text start="151.409" dur="5.041">company earnings expectations we see</text>
  <text start="154.019" dur="6.391">that is going in the opposite direction</text>
  <text start="156.45" dur="6.78">of initial jobless claims so what we are</text>
  <text start="160.41" dur="3.96">seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="163.23" dur="3.869">government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="164.37" dur="4.89">Yujin does not fit reality anymore and</text>
  <text start="167.099" dur="4.56">people are starting to look at this</text>
  <text start="169.26" dur="4.289">they&amp;#39;re understanding it and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="171.659" dur="4.591">saying something is terribly terribly</text>
  <text start="173.549" dur="6.69">wrong now the report from challenger</text>

  <text start="324.33" dur="2.809">just going to all of a sudden turn</text>
  <text start="325.139" dur="3.84">around and everyone&amp;#39;s going to get a job</text>
  <text start="327.139" dur="3.671">that&amp;#39;s one that&amp;#39;s not what&amp;#39;s happening</text>

  <text start="822.05" dur="7.47">sitting there what do we do and remember</text>
  <text start="826.84" dur="5.6">the government is keeping us in the dark</text>
  <text start="829.52" dur="5.05">of course everyone that is listening to</text>
  <text start="832.44" dur="3.84">the alternative media and other sources</text>
  <text start="834.57" dur="5.19">and not to the corporate media and to</text>
  <text start="836.28" dur="5.76">the government they have an edge we</text>
  <text start="839.76" dur="5.61">understand what&amp;#39;s happening we realize</text>
  <text start="842.04" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re lying to us now we understand</text>
  <text start="845.37" dur="4.14">that the debt is unsustainable at this</text>
  <text start="847.32" dur="5.25">point in time and it looks like Deutsche</text>
  <text start="849.51" dur="5.97">Bank and many other banks well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="852.57" dur="3.99">suggesting a wealth taxation now then</text>
  <text start="855.48" dur="3.06">you&amp;#39;re not going to come out and say</text>
  <text start="856.56" dur="3.06">okay I know the IMF wants to do this</text>
  <text start="858.54" dur="3.36">they want to come out and put a ten</text>
  <text start="859.62" dur="3.09">percent wealth tax on everyone but I</text>
  <text start="861.9" dur="3.84">think they&amp;#39;re going to do it more</text>
  <text start="862.71" dur="6.96">covertly and with negative interest</text>
  <text start="865.74" dur="7.29">rates it&amp;#39;s like having a tax on your</text>
  <text start="869.67" dur="4.83">savings and it looks like this is</text>
  <text start="873.03" dur="3">probably most likely what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="874.5" dur="2.88">to do now that they might implement</text>
  <text start="876.03" dur="3.69">negative interest rates like they did in</text>
  <text start="877.38" dur="5.97">Europe move down to the deposit rates</text>
  <text start="879.72" dur="5.13">which it&amp;#39;s heading toward now and they</text>
  <text start="883.35" dur="6.05">might even say we might have to start</text>
  <text start="884.85" dur="7.83">taxing savings accounts in this way</text>
  <text start="889.4" dur="5.65">every time you put your funds into the</text>
  <text start="892.68" dur="4.83">bank they will be taxed just like a</text>
  <text start="895.05" dur="4.11">sales tax now of course people are going</text>
  <text start="897.51" dur="3.9">to be angry people going to be pissed</text>
  <text start="899.16" dur="3.75">off think about when they implemented</text>
  <text start="901.41" dur="2.97">the income tax when they said it was</text>
  <text start="902.91" dur="3.09">only going to be done to the wealthy</text>
  <text start="904.38" dur="3.75">they most likely will say it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="906" dur="4.77">be to those people who are making 150 or</text>
  <text start="908.13" dur="4.05">200 thousand or more and then what they</text>
  <text start="910.77" dur="3.42">do is they slowly bring it down just</text>
  <text start="912.18" dur="3.48">like they did back in the time when they</text>
  <text start="914.19" dur="4.17">implemented the income tax which is</text>
  <text start="915.66" dur="4.26">completely unconstitutional they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="918.36" dur="2.7">going to do the same exact thing now</text>
  <text start="919.92" dur="2.13">people going to be very angry in the</text>
  <text start="921.06" dur="3.27">beginning they&amp;#39;re going to be happy</text>
  <text start="922.05" dur="4.29">because it&amp;#39;s on the wealthy but as time</text>
  <text start="924.33" dur="4.59">goes on and they keep taxing and they</text>
  <text start="926.34" dur="5.01">keep bringing it down guess what</text>
  <text start="928.92" dur="4.86">everyone is indoctrinated everyone is</text>
  <text start="931.35" dur="5.22">into it and I think this is how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="933.78" dur="6.39">going to try to approach it and with a</text>
  <text start="936.57" dur="5.79">casual society what are you gonna do you</text>
  <text start="940.17" dur="5.22">can&amp;#39;t take your funds out of the bank</text>
  <text start="942.36" dur="7.5">you can&amp;#39;t turn it into cash but you can</text>
  <text start="945.39" dur="8.22">buy gold and silver very interesting we</text>
  <text start="949.86" dur="4.74">are headed into a time where the bankers</text>
  <text start="953.61" dur="3.17">are going to be getting desperate</text>
  <text start="954.6" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re going to be making up new rules</text>
