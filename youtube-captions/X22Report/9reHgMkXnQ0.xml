  <text start="63.13" dur="6.69">the time where we said we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="66.31" dur="5.34">take back our freedoms the Declaration</text>
  <text start="69.82" dur="4.89">of Independence was written with a</text>
  <text start="71.65" dur="6.03">theory that every person has inherent</text>
  <text start="74.71" dur="5.22">rights called self-evident truths in the</text>
  <text start="77.68" dur="4.86">official document it reads we hold these</text>
  <text start="79.93" dur="4.95">truths to be self-evident that all men</text>

  <text start="84.88" dur="4.08">by their creator with certain</text>

  <text start="88.96" dur="4.47">life liberty and the pursuit of</text>
  <text start="90.729" dur="6.78">happiness and we are here once again on</text>
  <text start="93.43" dur="7.109">this july 4th 2016 fighting for these</text>
  <text start="97.509" dur="5.161">same rights and once again just like our</text>
  <text start="100.539" dur="5.64">founding fathers have told us we will</text>
  <text start="102.67" dur="7.08">have to fight again to be free to be</text>
  <text start="106.179" dur="5.821">free of a tyrannical government to be</text>
  <text start="109.75" dur="5.399">free of a government that&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="112" dur="6.36">remove our rights to be free from</text>
  <text start="115.149" dur="6.72">control of the central bank so once</text>
  <text start="118.36" dur="6.09">again we are fighting for the same thing</text>
  <text start="121.869" dur="6.691">that the founding fathers fought for</text>
  <text start="124.45" dur="6.75">back in 1776 let&amp;#39;s get right into the</text>
  <text start="128.56" dur="4.77">economic collapse news now we understand</text>
  <text start="131.2" dur="4.17">that the economy is continually</text>
  <text start="133.33" dur="6.42">deteriorating and we&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="135.37" dur="7.86">seeing more layoffs occur many of the</text>
  <text start="139.75" dur="4.62">corporations now are out there letting</text>
  <text start="143.23" dur="3.69">everyone know that there are more</text>
  <text start="144.37" dur="5.13">layoffs coming down the line we see that</text>
  <text start="146.92" dur="3.96">the US largest private coal miner</text>
  <text start="149.5" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re going to be laying off about</text>
  <text start="150.88" dur="6.18">eighty percent of their staff and what</text>
  <text start="154.75" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that Murray</text>
  <text start="157.06" dur="5.16">Energy Corp the largest privately-held</text>
  <text start="159.31" dur="4.95">coal miner in the US has warned that it</text>
  <text start="162.22" dur="4.909">may soon undertake</text>
  <text start="164.26" dur="6.99">the biggest layoffs in the sector about</text>
  <text start="167.129" dur="7.03">4,400 employees now we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="171.25" dur="6.599">this is not the only company other</text>
  <text start="174.159" dur="7.771">companies like Peabody Energy arch coal</text>
  <text start="177.849" dur="6.091">Alpha Natural Resources they all have</text>
  <text start="181.93" dur="6.18">laid off they&amp;#39;ve declared bankruptcy and</text>
  <text start="183.94" dur="7.23">we see right now in a statement from the</text>
  <text start="188.11" dur="5.969">company of Murray Energy Corp they said</text>
  <text start="191.17" dur="4.8">one of the main reasons for this is due</text>
  <text start="194.079" dur="3.871">to the ongoing destruction of the United</text>
  <text start="195.97" dur="4.56">States coal industry by President Obama</text>
  <text start="197.95" dur="4.17">and his supporters and the increased</text>
  <text start="200.53" dur="5.4">utilization of natural gas to generate</text>
  <text start="202.12" dur="5.369">electricity and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot more</text>
  <text start="205.93" dur="5.429">people they&amp;#39;re going to be unemployed</text>
  <text start="207.489" dur="6.08">and I say once again where is where are</text>
  <text start="211.359" dur="4.5">all these people going to find jobs and</text>
  <text start="213.569" dur="3.911">this is the major problem because as</text>
  <text start="215.859" dur="3.811">more and more these corporations layoffs</text>
  <text start="217.48" dur="3.539">there are no jobs this is why they</text>
  <text start="219.67" dur="3.12">created this model where all these</text>
  <text start="221.019" dur="3.901">people are falling off this is why they</text>
  <text start="222.79" dur="5.509">don&amp;#39;t count them anymore this is why</text>
  <text start="224.92" dur="6.42">we&amp;#39;re seeing the part-time economy grow</text>
  <text start="228.299" dur="6.52">this is why people can&amp;#39;t find that</text>
  <text start="231.34" dur="5.369">full-time position because as more and</text>
  <text start="234.819" dur="5.121">more corporations lay off it becomes</text>
  <text start="236.709" dur="5.61">more and more difficult Deutsche Bank</text>
  <text start="239.94" dur="7.359">they&amp;#39;re out there and they have</text>
  <text start="242.319" dur="7.831">calculated that a u.s. recession it is</text>
  <text start="247.299" dur="5.78">surged to sixty percent the probability</text>
  <text start="250.15" dur="7.5">of a recession is at sixty percent and</text>
  <text start="253.079" dur="6.761">they&amp;#39;re saying within the next 12 months</text>
  <text start="257.65" dur="5.31">the United States will be in a recession</text>
  <text start="259.84" dur="5.19">well we are already in a recession what</text>
  <text start="262.96" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re really saying is this is when</text>
  <text start="265.03" dur="5.46">the entire things going to collapse</text>
  <text start="266.71" dur="8.85">because when we look back in time we see</text>
  <text start="270.49" dur="10.109">that back in 2008 this probability that</text>
  <text start="275.56" dur="6.66">they had hit seventy percent and all of</text>
  <text start="280.599" dur="8.85">a sudden everything came crashing down</text>
  <text start="282.22" dur="10.499">in 2008 and their calculations their</text>
  <text start="289.449" dur="5.4">yield curve it has successfully signaled</text>
  <text start="292.719" dur="4.591">the last two recessions when the model</text>
  <text start="294.849" dur="3.361">output rose above seventy percent right</text>
  <text start="297.31" dur="5.34">now we are</text>
  <text start="298.21" dur="5.88">sixty percent so we are very close to</text>
  <text start="302.65" dur="5.16">this major collapse of the entire</text>
  <text start="304.09" dur="6.449">economy out in Austria we see far-right</text>
  <text start="307.81" dur="4.229">party leader Norbert Hoffer said turkey</text>
  <text start="310.539" dur="4.5">joining the block could be the</text>
  <text start="312.039" dur="5.461">game-changer that forces Austrians to</text>
  <text start="315.039" dur="5.991">call for an EU referendum they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="317.5" dur="8.069">they&amp;#39;re going to have to leave the EU if</text>
  <text start="321.03" dur="5.319">turkey wins the bid to join the EU so</text>
  <text start="325.569" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch that</text>
  <text start="326.349" dur="5.341">situation very carefully out in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="329.199" dur="4.981">we see the PM the prime minister calls</text>
  <text start="331.69" dur="5.819">for more NATO action to limit Russian</text>
  <text start="334.18" dur="6.62">aggression we also see this plan that</text>
  <text start="337.509" dur="7.951">turkey in Ukraine has to try to reclaim</text>
  <text start="340.8" dur="7.589">Crimea from Russia remember about a</text>
  <text start="345.46" dur="9.59">month or two ago we had turkey and</text>
  <text start="348.389" dur="11.701">ukraine sign an agreement to jointly</text>
  <text start="355.05" dur="9.01">control the Black Sea area we see that</text>
  <text start="360.09" dur="6.97">her one and poroshenko at the end of</text>
  <text start="364.06" dur="4.68">June of 2016 they&amp;#39;d have embarked on a</text>
  <text start="367.06" dur="3.51">further escalation of their</text>
  <text start="368.74" dur="5.429">confrontation with Russia through the</text>
  <text start="370.57" dur="8.339">sponsorship of jihadism on the Crimean</text>
  <text start="374.169" dur="7.351">Peninsula this campaign right now it is</text>
  <text start="378.909" dur="4.26">picking up pace to the point of becoming</text>
  <text start="381.52" dur="4.11">irreversible because of the recent</text>
  <text start="383.169" dur="4.581">activation of the Crimean tartar</text>
  <text start="385.63" dur="5.46">battalion and the turkish ukrainian</text>
  <text start="387.75" dur="8.11">comprehensive program to islam Assize</text>
  <text start="391.09" dur="7.199">the border area with Crimea now Kiev is</text>
  <text start="395.86" dur="7.2">eager to participate because this</text>
  <text start="398.289" dur="9.241">program will escalate the confrontation</text>
  <text start="403.06" dur="7.919">with Russia and they&amp;#39;re hoping it will</text>
  <text start="407.53" dur="6.6">prevent a political solution even if the</text>
  <text start="410.979" dur="6.151">u.s. attempts to impose whant which we</text>
  <text start="414.13" dur="4.62">know they&amp;#39;re not going to the Crimean</text>
  <text start="417.13" dur="4.069">Tartars battalion deployed in the</text>
  <text start="418.75" dur="6.93">kherson region on the border with Crimea</text>
  <text start="421.199" dur="7.541">back in April of 2016 declared the unit</text>
  <text start="425.68" dur="4.83">to be a national military unit the</text>
  <text start="428.74" dur="3.42">Crimean Tartars soldiers described their</text>
  <text start="430.51" dur="5.1">unit as suicide</text>
  <text start="432.16" dur="6.98">battalion committed to the liberation of</text>
  <text start="435.61" dur="7.11">Crimea now at the heart of this program</text>
  <text start="439.14" dur="7.48">was the transformation of Ukraine&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="442.72" dur="7.17">curson province into a Turkic Bastion</text>
  <text start="446.62" dur="5.94">from where this whole entire operation</text>
  <text start="449.89" dur="5.22">can be launched senior Turkish</text>
  <text start="452.56" dur="6.21">intelligence officials acknowledge that</text>
  <text start="455.11" dur="9.3">erdo wan&amp;#39;s Ankara they had been dreaming</text>
  <text start="458.77" dur="8.07">for a long time of occupying Crimea</text>
  <text start="464.41" dur="6.72">again which was lost during Russian</text>
  <text start="466.84" dur="9.75">Turkish Wars so we see that turkey and</text>
  <text start="471.13" dur="6.93">ukraine they&amp;#39;re working together they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="476.59" dur="4.44">getting prepared and ready and we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="554.26" dur="5.25">the Mediterranean but we also realize in</text>
  <text start="557.83" dur="4.32">the last two weeks there were at least</text>
  <text start="559.51" dur="5.01">four huge cargo vessels carrying</text>
  <text start="562.15" dur="3.69">military consignments for Russian</text>
  <text start="564.52" dur="4.26">fighter jets and this</text>
  <text start="565.84" dur="5.07">Syrian army so Russia and Syria they are</text>
  <text start="568.78" dur="5.01">bringing in more military assets the</text>
  <text start="570.91" dur="4.77">same time united states and the</text>

  <text start="575.68" dur="6.33">military assets building the bases and</text>
  <text start="577.98" dur="6.13">setting up everything for this major</text>
  <text start="582.01" dur="3.53">offensive and this is something that we</text>
  <text start="584.11" dur="4.14">need to watch and we have to remember</text>
  <text start="585.54" dur="5.67">incirlik air base right now is currently</text>
  <text start="588.25" dur="9.3">being used by the United States Germany</text>
  <text start="591.21" dur="11.22">UK Qatar and Saudi Arabia and we realize</text>
  <text start="597.55" dur="8.31">that all of this is being done right now</text>
  <text start="602.43" dur="6.07">to try to take back Syria we know</text>
  <text start="605.86" dur="6.24">President Obama came out made this</text>
  <text start="608.5" dur="6.54">proposal to Putin and we know there is a</text>
  <text start="612.1" dur="4.62">catch with that we know that the United</text>
  <text start="615.04" dur="4.67">States has been separated the moderate</text>
  <text start="616.72" dur="5.13">rebels from al-nusrah from al Qaeda and</text>
  <text start="619.71" dur="3.67">it&amp;#39;s going to make it very difficult now</text>
  <text start="621.85" dur="3.15">of course Russia&amp;#39;s most likely going to</text>
  <text start="623.38" dur="5.91">come back and say okay let&amp;#39;s work with</text>
  <text start="625" dur="6.78">this proposal you tell us where the</text>
  <text start="629.29" dur="4.32">moderate rebels are and make sure</text>
  <text start="631.78" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re not intertwined with al-nusrah</text>
  <text start="633.61" dur="5.04">and we won&amp;#39;t bomb them and we know that</text>
  <text start="636.37" dur="3.69">this is not going to work but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="638.65" dur="6.54">going to have to watch a situation very</text>
  <text start="640.06" dur="8.52">carefully now we see there are many</text>
  <text start="645.19" dur="4.29">calls for false flag events that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="648.58" dur="2.37">what they&amp;#39;re calling them they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="649.48" dur="4.35">calling them attacks by the Islamic</text>
  <text start="650.95" dur="6.18">state they&amp;#39;re calling them attacks by Al</text>
  <text start="653.83" dur="8.1">Qaeda and this is continually building</text>
  <text start="657.13" dur="7.65">this up in the world&amp;#39;s mind that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="661.93" dur="5.13">going to be attacks coming very soon now</text>
  <text start="664.78" dur="3.42">of course they need to do this and we</text>
  <text start="667.06" dur="4.25">know it&amp;#39;s going to be a false flag</text>
  <text start="668.2" dur="8.96">because they need to get the country&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="671.31" dur="10.78">the people the government&amp;#39;s all together</text>
  <text start="677.16" dur="6.61">to go fight in this next war and as we</text>
  <text start="682.09" dur="3.63">move forward as we go through this year</text>
  <text start="683.77" dur="4.2">the economy is going to continually</text>
  <text start="685.72" dur="4.47">deteriorate things are going to get</text>
  <text start="687.97" dur="5.49">worse we&amp;#39;re going to see more of these</text>
  <text start="690.19" dur="6.42">false flag events and eventually we will</text>
  <text start="693.46" dur="5.73">see that main event because once we get</text>
  <text start="696.61" dur="2.91">to that point where they decide okay it</text>
  <text start="699.19" dur="3.45">is</text>
  <text start="699.52" dur="5.01">time to bring down the economy because</text>
  <text start="702.64" dur="3.3">they don&amp;#39;t want something coming out of</text>

  <text start="705.94" dur="5.7">event they&amp;#39;re going to bring down the</text>
  <text start="708.01" dur="7.02">economy and they will have this event to</text>
  <text start="711.64" dur="7.16">cover what is really happening they need</text>
  <text start="715.03" dur="6.93">to blame another group another party and</text>
  <text start="718.8" dur="6.04">when this comes it&amp;#39;s not going to stop</text>
  <text start="721.96" dur="5.04">the economic collapse it&amp;#39;s just going to</text>
  <text start="724.84" dur="4.2">cover it up of what really happened and</text>
  <text start="727" dur="5.04">the corporate media is going to be out</text>
  <text start="729.04" dur="6.3">there televising it like crazy that it</text>
  <text start="732.04" dur="6.18">was this group this country that caused</text>
  <text start="735.34" dur="5.85">all of this but we know from following</text>
  <text start="738.22" dur="6.29">this from tracking it it was the US</text>
