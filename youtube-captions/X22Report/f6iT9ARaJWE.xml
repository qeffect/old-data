  <text start="207.89" dur="3.96">public they really didn&amp;#39;t realize what</text>
  <text start="210.26" dur="4.02">was going on today it&amp;#39;s even worse</text>
  <text start="211.85" dur="4.139">because you don&amp;#39;t see any of that you</text>
  <text start="214.28" dur="5.13">don&amp;#39;t see any bread lines you don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="215.989" dur="6.421">pretty much of anything and all you see</text>
  <text start="219.41" dur="7.53">is the stock market moving to new highs</text>
  <text start="222.41" dur="8.07">ESP the Dow everything going well and</text>
  <text start="226.94" dur="5.609">people the gold is being smacked down so</text>
  <text start="230.48" dur="3.599">when people look at it you know you know</text>
  <text start="232.549" dur="3.901">people aren&amp;#39;t buying gold anymore</text>
  <text start="234.079" dur="5.761">because they don&amp;#39;t need the disaster</text>
  <text start="236.45" dur="6.21">insurance as Ben Bernanke says that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="239.84" dur="5.25">why you have gold so you know to</text>
  <text start="242.66" dur="4.02">everyone around the world everything</text>
  <text start="245.09" dur="4.41">looks great but when you look at Europe</text>
  <text start="246.68" dur="7.679">you see things starting to crumble and</text>
  <text start="249.5" dur="9.59">fall apart Greece may have to leave the</text>
  <text start="254.359" dur="8.221">eurozone a European economist says and</text>
  <text start="259.09" dur="4.389">too you know for them to receive more</text>
  <text start="262.58" dur="3.16">fun</text>
  <text start="263.479" dur="4.061">greece must stick to the agenda of</text>
  <text start="265.74" dur="4.399">either transferring or laying off</text>
  <text start="267.54" dur="4.65">thousands of civil servants and</text>
  <text start="270.139" dur="4.421">including athens municipal police</text>
  <text start="272.19" dur="4.349">teachers school security personnel by</text>
  <text start="274.56" dur="8.55">the end of this year so for them to</text>
  <text start="276.539" dur="8.481">receive more debt they need to get rid</text>
  <text start="283.11" dur="5.76">of people and make their unemployment</text>
  <text start="285.02" dur="9.1">higher so they need to put people out of</text>
  <text start="288.87" dur="9.329">work and make these people not receive</text>
  <text start="294.12" dur="7.32">an income so these people now cannot go</text>
  <text start="298.199" dur="6.541">out and purchase goods from stores so</text>
  <text start="301.44" dur="6.39">sales will be less to receive more debt</text>
  <text start="304.74" dur="6.33">so the government can make more interest</text>
  <text start="307.83" dur="5.13">payments and cover the interest payments</text>
  <text start="311.07" dur="5.67">on the debt they have already received</text>
  <text start="312.96" dur="6.81">and right now I mean I mean look at this</text>
  <text start="316.74" dur="6.12">the unemployment level in Greece right</text>
  <text start="319.77" dur="5.03">now is around twenty seven percent now</text>
  <text start="322.86" dur="5.489">think about it they&amp;#39;re going to lay off</text>
  <text start="324.8" dur="5.44">get rid of more people so what is this</text>
  <text start="328.349" dur="3.331">going to do to the unemployment but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="330.24" dur="5.97">going to bring it up to what thirty</text>
  <text start="331.68" dur="6.93">percent and even the younger people who</text>
  <text start="336.21" dur="8.269">are coming out of school looking for</text>
  <text start="338.61" dur="8.82">work the unemployment is at sixty 2.5%</text>
  <text start="344.479" dur="5.5">so for the government to receive more</text>
  <text start="347.43" dur="6.419">debt they&amp;#39;re going to lay off more</text>
  <text start="349.979" dur="6.93">people get you know cut jobs so these</text>
  <text start="353.849" dur="5.79">people will not give back to society the</text>
  <text start="356.909" dur="5.101">unemployment rate will go higher they</text>
  <text start="359.639" dur="4.411">will receive their money be the people</text>
  <text start="362.01" dur="3.93">who are at the higher level government</text>
  <text start="364.05" dur="3.359">will be happy because you know they get</text>
  <text start="365.94" dur="3.57">to keep their jobs their salaries</text>
  <text start="367.409" dur="4.26">continually coming in they don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="369.51" dur="6.6">worry and when that money starts running</text>
  <text start="371.669" dur="7.231">out there in worse shape than they were</text>
  <text start="376.11" dur="5.67">before because all they did was pile</text>
  <text start="378.9" dur="5.79">debt upon that upon that now their</text>
  <text start="381.78" dur="5.04">interest payments are even larger so now</text>
  <text start="384.69" dur="3.81">they need even more money but to get</text>
  <text start="386.82" dur="4.529">this more money they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="388.5" dur="6.62">lay off more people and it&amp;#39;s a cycle</text>
  <text start="391.349" dur="5.431">that will never end and it only ends in</text>
  <text start="395.12" dur="5.08">collapse</text>
  <text start="396.78" dur="6.18">and if it was a normal business it would</text>
  <text start="400.2" dur="8.07">be bankruptcy if it was a family it</text>
  <text start="402.96" dur="8.73">would be bankruptcy and this also says</text>
  <text start="408.27" dur="6.99">you know one out of every five Greek</text>
  <text start="411.69" dur="6.449">workers is currently unemployed so if</text>
  <text start="415.26" dur="6.57">you know five people one of those people</text>
  <text start="418.139" dur="6.211">is out of work banks are in shaky</text>
  <text start="421.83" dur="6.51">position and pensions and salaries have</text>
  <text start="424.35" dur="8.43">been slashed by up to forty percent so</text>
  <text start="428.34" dur="7.5">how is this getting better it isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="432.78" dur="5.79">there just prolonging the pain that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="435.84" dur="5.67">all they&amp;#39;re doing it&amp;#39;s like taking a</text>
  <text start="438.57" dur="6.03">drug addict and continually giving him</text>
  <text start="441.51" dur="6.99">the same drugs and eventually what</text>
  <text start="444.6" dur="7.379">happens the drug addict Odie&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="448.5" dur="6.69">things going to happen in Greece now in</text>
  <text start="451.979" dur="7.261">Cyprus since the wonderful ballons and</text>

  <text start="486.2" dur="5.339">businesses are afraid to go into Cyprus</text>
  <text start="488.91" dur="5.64">so what is going to happen to Cyprus</text>
  <text start="491.539" dur="5.38">it&amp;#39;s going to look just like Greece</text>
  <text start="494.55" dur="9.36">there is there&amp;#39;s no difference there</text>
  <text start="496.919" dur="8.731">whatsoever now in Italy they are having</text>

  <text start="546.69" dur="5.79">reported to be living in the poverty</text>
  <text start="548.64" dur="7.77">level so we&amp;#39;re seeing this continually</text>
  <text start="552.48" dur="6.72">rise and now we see Cyprus we see Greece</text>
  <text start="556.41" dur="6.84">we see Italy we see all those other</text>

  <text start="770.07" dur="4.35">continuously gone down gone down gone</text>
  <text start="771.93" dur="5.43">down gone down but if we use the real</text>
  <text start="774.42" dur="5.97">calculation the one prior to nineteen</text>

  <text start="2036.11" dur="5.939">it&amp;#39;s just the Second Amendment maybe</text>
  <text start="2037.94" dur="6.18">that&amp;#39;s what it is okay let&amp;#39;s look at the</text>
  <text start="2042.049" dur="4.38">Fourth Amendment so I&amp;#39;m going to read</text>
  <text start="2044.12" dur="3.84">you the original Fourth Amendment the</text>
  <text start="2046.429" dur="4.23">right of the people to be secure in</text>
  <text start="2047.96" dur="4.409">their persons houses papers and effects</text>

  <text start="2059.81" dur="4.02">affirmation and particularly describing</text>
  <text start="2062" dur="4.83">the place to be searched and the persons</text>
  <text start="2063.83" dur="6.93">or things to be seized so over here it</text>
  <text start="2066.83" dur="8.16">says protects citizens from unreasonable</text>
  <text start="2070.76" dur="6.21">search and seizure the government may</text>
  <text start="2074.99" dur="4.83">not conduct any searches without a</text>
  <text start="2076.97" dur="8.03">warrant and such warrants must be issued</text>
  <text start="2079.82" dur="8.16">by a judge based on probable cause now</text>
  <text start="2085" dur="4.81">doesn&amp;#39;t say anything about people to be</text>
  <text start="2087.98" dur="8.429">secure and first of all it says citizen</text>
  <text start="2089.81" dur="10.32">again and it also says protects where</text>
  <text start="2096.409" dur="8.521">the government is protecting where if we</text>
  <text start="2100.13" dur="7.92">want to we can unprotect but it also</text>
  <text start="2104.93" dur="6.59">leaves out that people to be secure in</text>
  <text start="2108.05" dur="10.76">their persons houses papers and effects</text>
  <text start="2111.52" dur="7.29">against unreasonable searches</text>
  <text start="2120.65" dur="5.699">so it&amp;#39;s very interesting how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2124.039" dur="6.75">changing everything the Fifth Amendment</text>
  <text start="2126.349" dur="7.19">says provides the citizens not not be</text>
