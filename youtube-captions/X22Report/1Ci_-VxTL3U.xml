  <text start="52.34" dur="7.52">and talk about Europe and Greece at this</text>
  <text start="56.15" dur="6.78">point the eurozone right now is</text>
  <text start="59.86" dur="6.81">deteriorating and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="62.93" dur="7.89">the eurozone countries start to crack</text>
  <text start="66.67" dur="7.51">splinter fall apart collapse because as</text>
  <text start="70.82" dur="7.47">we know the countries that weren&amp;#39;t doing</text>
  <text start="74.18" dur="6.18">well back in 2013 2014 2015 they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="78.29" dur="4.35">improved actually things have gotten a</text>
  <text start="80.36" dur="6.99">lot worse they&amp;#39;ve piled on more debt</text>
  <text start="82.64" dur="6.479">they installed draconian laws and the</text>
  <text start="87.35" dur="4.59">people have lost their rights in many of</text>
  <text start="89.119" dur="5.61">the countries in the euro zone and right</text>
  <text start="91.94" dur="6.78">now we see in the eurozone the economic</text>
  <text start="94.729" dur="8.901">sentiment basically deteriorated for</text>
  <text start="98.72" dur="8.759">more than they expected in February and</text>
  <text start="103.63" dur="5.59">people are very pessimistic we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="107.479" dur="4.411">that the service and retail sector among</text>
  <text start="109.22" dur="5.16">consumers and financial services has</text>
  <text start="111.89" dur="5.64">declined and all of this is coming from</text>
  <text start="114.38" dur="5.64">the European Commission the Commission</text>
  <text start="117.53" dur="4.56">said economic sentiment in the 19</text>
  <text start="120.02" dur="3.9">countries sharing the euro fell to a</text>
  <text start="122.09" dur="6.18">hundred and three point eight in</text>
  <text start="123.92" dur="7.02">February and it is down from 100 and 5.1</text>
  <text start="128.27" dur="8.219">in January they&amp;#39;re saying the business</text>
  <text start="130.94" dur="9.629">climate indicator fell sharply 2.07 from</text>
  <text start="136.489" dur="8.431">point 29 in january so things out in</text>
  <text start="140.569" dur="7.711">europe don&amp;#39;t look that good now we know</text>
  <text start="144.92" dur="6.03">greece they made a deal with the</text>
  <text start="148.28" dur="5.76">eurozone they haven&amp;#39;t made a deal with</text>
  <text start="150.95" dur="5.03">the IMF just yet eurozone is continually</text>
  <text start="154.04" dur="6.69">putting them into further and further</text>
  <text start="155.98" dur="6.7">debt and we see Greece has not improved</text>
  <text start="160.73" dur="6.479">we&amp;#39;re seeing more protests more riots</text>
  <text start="162.68" dur="9.059">and the poverty index in Greece went up</text>
  <text start="167.209" dur="7.741">to nine percent in 2015 making it the</text>
  <text start="171.739" dur="5.761">worst year since the economic crisis now</text>
  <text start="174.95" dur="4.64">remember back in two thousand eight when</text>
  <text start="177.5" dur="4.2">we had the first tranche of debt and</text>
  <text start="179.59" dur="4">they told us that everything was going</text>
  <text start="181.7" dur="4.67">to be fine in Greece then it happened</text>
  <text start="183.59" dur="7.08">again like in 2011 and so forth and</text>
  <text start="186.37" dur="6.459">guess what they&amp;#39;ve been wrong it has</text>
  <text start="190.67" dur="5.58">never gotten better increase actually</text>
  <text start="192.829" dur="6.08">what has happened it has gotten worse</text>
  <text start="196.25" dur="5.849">it&amp;#39;s the opposite of what they told us</text>
  <text start="198.909" dur="8.651">so along with the rise of the poverty</text>
  <text start="202.099" dur="11.61">index the risk of poverty went up 16.1</text>
  <text start="207.56" dur="8.849">percent so the people in Greece they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="213.709" dur="5.101">not getting their subsidies and benefits</text>
  <text start="216.409" dur="6.571">from the government because they were</text>
  <text start="218.81" dur="7.709">not distributed in 2015 and it&amp;#39;s making</text>
  <text start="222.98" dur="5.58">them very very hard to survive and this</text>
  <text start="226.519" dur="4.11">is what&amp;#39;s going to happen because in</text>
  <text start="228.56" dur="6.269">many of the countries because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="230.629" dur="7.86">seeing right now is that these countries</text>
  <text start="234.829" dur="7.47">even the US where people are depending</text>
  <text start="238.489" dur="8.521">on food stamps on the government</text>
  <text start="242.299" dur="7.381">subsidies a lot of its going to dry up</text>
  <text start="247.01" dur="7.349">the government will not be able to pay</text>
  <text start="249.68" dur="7.23">and this is going to pose a huge problem</text>
  <text start="254.359" dur="4.801">in each one of these countries so you</text>
  <text start="256.91" dur="5.75">can look at Greece as the model of what</text>
  <text start="259.16" dur="6.479">to come and we are headed down that path</text>
  <text start="262.66" dur="4.42">now we realize that Obama is continually</text>
  <text start="265.639" dur="3.631">telling us that we are in this</text>
  <text start="267.08" dur="3.78">incredible recovery the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="269.27" dur="4.89">fine unemployed is a four point nine</text>
  <text start="270.86" dur="4.98">percent you must believe me just believe</text>
  <text start="274.16" dur="3.99">what I&amp;#39;m telling you it doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="275.84" dur="4.32">what you feel well most people feel as</text>
  <text start="278.15" dur="6.15">we know because consumer confidence is</text>
  <text start="280.16" dur="6">going down both in the board and in the</text>
  <text start="284.3" dur="4.44">Gallup polls because people are feeling</text>
  <text start="286.16" dur="5.22">that something&amp;#39;s wrong here it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="288.74" dur="4.59">right the way the economy is operating</text>
  <text start="291.38" dur="4.14">at this time and I just got laid off</text>
  <text start="293.33" dur="3.959">from my job why is it so hard to find a</text>
  <text start="295.52" dur="4.259">job if unemployment is</text>
  <text start="297.289" dur="5.791">four point nine percent this is what</text>
  <text start="299.779" dur="5.521">people are wondering why aren&amp;#39;t their</text>
  <text start="303.08" dur="3.929">jobs out there and when I do find one</text>
  <text start="305.3" dur="6.899">and I put my resume out how come no</text>
  <text start="307.009" dur="10.231">one&amp;#39;s responding why is retail falling</text>
  <text start="312.199" dur="6.18">apart Sears chairman Eddie Lampert he</text>
  <text start="317.24" dur="5.849">released a letter to the shareholders</text>
  <text start="318.379" dur="8.34">and basically was all bad news he sang</text>
  <text start="323.089" dur="7.8">because of tectonic shifts in consumer</text>
  <text start="326.719" dur="7.92">spending sears is not going to do well</text>
  <text start="330.889" dur="8.49">whatsoever well it&amp;#39;s not just Sears its</text>
  <text start="334.639" dur="7.8">many other retailers they&amp;#39;re all doing</text>
  <text start="339.379" dur="6.6">poorly I mean we know Sears sports</text>
  <text start="342.439" dur="6.27">authority Cole&amp;#39;s target best buy office</text>
  <text start="345.979" dur="5.881">d by Walmart Kmart JC Penney Macy&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="348.709" dur="7.77">gap era Pacelle and the finish line</text>
  <text start="351.86" dur="9.479">sporting goods store all doing poorly</text>
  <text start="356.479" dur="8.49">closing hundreds of stores now the</text>
  <text start="361.339" dur="7.62">question is why is this happening if the</text>
  <text start="364.969" dur="5.82">economy is near full employment and the</text>
  <text start="368.959" dur="3.39">economy is doing so well but actually</text>
  <text start="370.789" dur="3.12">when you look at it and you look at the</text>
  <text start="372.349" dur="4.49">real economic indicators we notice that</text>
  <text start="373.909" dur="6.021">basically everything&amp;#39;s flat line and</text>
  <text start="376.839" dur="6.16">dropping at this point most of it is</text>
  <text start="379.93" dur="4.9">bubble focus and that&amp;#39;s what i call the</text>
  <text start="382.999" dur="4.2">central bank making everyone focus on</text>
  <text start="384.83" dur="4.679">their bubbles to make everyone believe</text>
  <text start="387.199" dur="3.39">that the economy is doing well but when</text>
  <text start="389.509" dur="4.02">you look at the middle class in America</text>
  <text start="390.589" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s shrinking if you look at the people</text>
  <text start="393.529" dur="3.331">that had high paying jobs they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="395.419" dur="3.36">getting low paying jobs or they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="396.86" dur="5.579">have jobs so their discretionary</text>
  <text start="398.779" dur="5.07">spending completely disappeared so</text>
  <text start="402.439" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re not going out and buying things</text>
  <text start="403.849" dur="6.02">and since they&amp;#39;re not buying things what</text>
  <text start="406.249" dur="5.64">happens well demand for goods goes down</text>
  <text start="409.869" dur="5.41">manufacturers factories they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="411.889" dur="6.65">to produce which means that rail traffic</text>
  <text start="415.279" dur="6.56">trucking disappears the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="418.539" dur="6.31">stays at this very low number and</text>
  <text start="421.839" dur="5.26">manufacturing declines and this is what</text>
  <text start="424.849" dur="4.74">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing when you put all the</text>
  <text start="427.099" dur="4.141">pieces together it makes sense that the</text>
  <text start="429.589" dur="3.661">economy is not doing well</text>
  <text start="431.24" dur="4.44">but if you look at their bubbles and</text>
  <text start="433.25" dur="3.9">you&amp;#39;re really not looking outside of the</text>
  <text start="435.68" dur="3.209">bubble that the central bank created in</text>
  <text start="437.15" dur="4.16">the US government created it looks like</text>
  <text start="438.889" dur="6">the economy is doing absolutely well</text>
  <text start="441.31" dur="5.77">well it&amp;#39;s an illusion think about this</text>
  <text start="444.889" dur="4.351">for a second remember right before the</text>
  <text start="447.08" dur="7.23">stock market crash in 2008 then again in</text>
  <text start="449.24" dur="8.19">2009 everyone thought that everything</text>
  <text start="454.31" dur="5.37">was fine everyone thought the economy</text>
  <text start="457.43" dur="4.2">was doing very well well they kept on</text>
  <text start="459.68" dur="3.329">telling us it was doing well it kept on</text>
  <text start="461.63" dur="5.93">telling us that things are going to</text>
  <text start="463.009" dur="6.78">improve but until the market came down</text>
  <text start="467.56" dur="7.109">everyone believed this and then when the</text>
  <text start="469.789" dur="4.88">market crashed and then crashed again</text>
  <text start="474.819" dur="8.111">companies had the excuse to lay off</text>
  <text start="477.49" dur="9.269">thousands upon thousands of people all</text>
  <text start="482.93" dur="8.16">of a sudden we see these businessmen in</text>
  <text start="486.759" dur="7.181">the government asking for a handout now</text>
  <text start="491.09" dur="5.79">before this everyone thought everything</text>
  <text start="493.94" dur="5.49">was fine the illusion was in place when</text>
  <text start="496.88" dur="6.93">the illusion was exposed of just that an</text>
  <text start="499.43" dur="6.539">illusion all of a sudden all hell broke</text>
  <text start="503.81" dur="4.829">loose that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="505.969" dur="6.93">again we have this illusion and in</text>
  <text start="508.639" dur="7.351">everyone&amp;#39;s mind everything is fine but</text>
  <text start="512.899" dur="5.281">when the illusion gives way this is when</text>
  <text start="515.99" dur="4.32">the problem starts and this is where</text>
  <text start="518.18" dur="4.739">we&amp;#39;re headed because we are looking at</text>
  <text start="520.31" dur="4.07">everything that happened in 2008 we</text>
  <text start="522.919" dur="4.17">compared to what&amp;#39;s happening now and</text>
  <text start="524.38" dur="5.709">actually most of the economic indicators</text>
  <text start="527.089" dur="5.161">are much worse than two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="530.089" dur="6.181">now and they&amp;#39;re continually getting</text>
  <text start="532.25" dur="8.459">worse the Baltic Dry Index popped up a</text>
  <text start="536.27" dur="6.96">little bit 2 327 now this could be a</text>
  <text start="540.709" dur="4.261">dead cat bounce where normally when we</text>
  <text start="543.23" dur="3.359">see a huge crash it bounces up a little</text>
  <text start="544.97" dur="3.48">bit and then it crashes once again</text>
  <text start="546.589" dur="3.781">further this is what happened in the</text>
  <text start="548.45" dur="4.74">stock market back in 2008 going into</text>
  <text start="550.37" dur="4.02">2009 and we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch</text>
  <text start="553.19" dur="3.269">this very carefully and this is why</text>
  <text start="554.39" dur="5.85">we&amp;#39;re tracking all of this to see</text>
  <text start="556.459" dur="6.421">exactly what is happening to put the</text>
  <text start="560.24" dur="4.819">pieces together to understand how is</text>
  <text start="562.88" dur="4.35">this economy actually working</text>
  <text start="565.059" dur="5.56">well when you hide things under the</text>
  <text start="567.23" dur="7.919">carpet keep things in the closet yeah</text>
  <text start="570.619" dur="6.15">everything looks great but when start</text>
  <text start="575.149" dur="4.021">when people start poking around in</text>
  <text start="576.769" dur="5.1">opening closets and things fall out you</text>
  <text start="579.17" dur="6.12">see the real mess you see what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="581.869" dur="5.91">hiding right now they went back in time</text>
  <text start="585.29" dur="6.509">to the fourth quarter GDP they revised</text>
  <text start="587.779" dur="6.09">that number to one percent now the</text>
  <text start="591.799" dur="5.551">revision reflects an unwanted buildup of</text>
  <text start="593.869" dur="5.731">inventories and the real final sales</text>
  <text start="597.35" dur="6.299">were very weak at one point two percent</text>
  <text start="599.6" dur="5.419">so they&amp;#39;re pushing GDP up and then what</text>
  <text start="603.649" dur="6.12">they&amp;#39;ll do is they&amp;#39;ll take that</text>
  <text start="605.019" dur="8.26">inventory and they&amp;#39;ll place it into the</text>
  <text start="609.769" dur="6.24">first quarter of 2016 and subtract from</text>
  <text start="613.279" dur="5.821">the first quarter growth and basically</text>
  <text start="616.009" dur="5.221">try to hide this whole entire thing but</text>
  <text start="619.1" dur="6.479">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is this is exactly</text>
  <text start="621.23" dur="6.959">what they do each time they push things</text>
  <text start="625.579" dur="4.35">into different quarters they manipulate</text>
  <text start="628.189" dur="3.87">massage the numbers to make it look</text>
  <text start="629.929" dur="4.47">better than they really are if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="632.059" dur="5.43">having a problem they push up Obamacare</text>
  <text start="634.399" dur="5.87">they bring that in they continually do</text>
  <text start="637.489" dur="6.15">this to make the numbers look fantastic</text>
  <text start="640.269" dur="5.98">now what&amp;#39;s happening right now is that</text>
  <text start="643.639" dur="5.06">we have seen the burst of globalization</text>
  <text start="646.249" dur="5.67">and now we&amp;#39;re at the point of</text>
  <text start="648.699" dur="6.25">consolidation maybe retrenchment and</text>
  <text start="651.919" dur="6">this is coming from the WTO chief</text>
  <text start="654.949" dur="6.99">economist Robert koopman and he said</text>
  <text start="657.919" dur="6.45">this last last fall it&amp;#39;s almost like the</text>
  <text start="661.939" dur="4.62">timing belt on the global growth engine</text>
  <text start="664.369" dur="5.64">is a bit off the cylinders and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="666.559" dur="6.541">not firing as they should things are</text>
  <text start="670.009" dur="5.79">looking pretty grim right now so we go</text>
  <text start="673.1" dur="6.149">to see what Maersk is going doing one of</text>
  <text start="675.799" dur="5.97">the biggest shipping companies and we</text>
  <text start="679.249" dur="7.26">see that the largest container operator</text>
  <text start="681.769" dur="6.3">mask basically racked up a hundred and</text>
  <text start="686.509" dur="4.62">eighty two million in red ink last</text>
  <text start="688.069" dur="7.751">quarter and the outlook for 2016 right</text>
  <text start="691.129" dur="9.731">now is not good it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="695.82" dur="8.16">looking really bad so we got the latest</text>
  <text start="700.86" dur="7.05">evidence that everything is completely</text>
  <text start="703.98" dur="5.25">falling apart according to new data from</text>
  <text start="707.91" dur="3.71">the Netherlands Bureau of Economic</text>
  <text start="709.23" dur="5.94">Policy Analysis World Trade monitor</text>

  <text start="723.12" dur="6.45">the first contraction since 2009 the new</text>

  <text start="739.41" dur="8.88">already shaping up to be much much worse</text>
