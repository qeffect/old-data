  <text start="58.98" dur="7.08">episode 1597 a.n today&amp;#39;s date is June</text>
  <text start="62.789" dur="6.15">21st 2018 and the tot of the episode is</text>
  <text start="66.06" dur="6.21">it&amp;#39;s all starting to happen at the same</text>
  <text start="68.939" dur="5.46">time beware the crash is coming let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="72.27" dur="5.94">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="74.399" dur="7.83">news now we know that retail isn&amp;#39;t doing</text>
  <text start="78.21" dur="6.78">well and we have a separation which is</text>
  <text start="82.229" dur="5.071">kind of strange in itself we have the</text>
  <text start="84.99" dur="3.81">online retailers and the</text>
  <text start="87.3" dur="3.239">brick-and-mortar retailers now some of</text>
  <text start="88.8" dur="4.64">the brick-and-mortar retailers they have</text>
  <text start="90.539" dur="5.341">an online presence and many online</text>
  <text start="93.44" dur="5.41">retailers they don&amp;#39;t really have a</text>
  <text start="95.88" dur="5.989">brick-and-mortar presence so we have</text>
  <text start="98.85" dur="6.449">this kind of separation here and</text>
  <text start="101.869" dur="6.491">throughout the online history where you</text>
  <text start="105.299" dur="4.35">purchase your goods online if you are</text>
  <text start="108.36" dur="5.91">out of state you didn&amp;#39;t have to pay</text>
  <text start="109.649" dur="7.5">attacks now the US Supreme Court ruled</text>
  <text start="114.27" dur="5.809">that the states may require out-of-state</text>
  <text start="117.149" dur="6.031">online retailers to collect sales tax on</text>
  <text start="120.079" dur="6.161">merchandise they sell in that state now</text>
  <text start="123.18" dur="6.719">there was a ruling in 1992 and it was</text>
  <text start="126.24" dur="6.6">quill corp vers North Dakota and they</text>
  <text start="129.899" dur="5.34">block States from compelling retailers</text>
  <text start="132.84" dur="5.25">with no physical presence in that state</text>
  <text start="135.239" dur="5.131">to collect sales tax now what has</text>
  <text start="138.09" dur="4.8">happened here is that the Government</text>
  <text start="140.37" dur="4.56">Accountability Office estimated the</text>
  <text start="142.89" dur="5.219">state and local governments could have</text>
  <text start="144.93" dur="6.839">collected between 8 billion and 13</text>
  <text start="148.109" dur="5.13">billion in sales taxes in 2017 if states</text>
  <text start="151.769" dur="3.661">were given authority to require sales</text>
  <text start="153.239" dur="5.611">tax collection from all remote sellers</text>
  <text start="155.43" dur="5.76">in today&amp;#39;s ruling authored by Justice</text>
  <text start="158.85" dur="4.71">Anthony Kennedy the court sided with</text>
  <text start="161.19" dur="4.65">South Dakota which had passed a law in</text>
  <text start="163.56" dur="4.799">2016 that required large out-of-state</text>
  <text start="165.84" dur="5.13">online retailers to collect sales tax on</text>
  <text start="168.359" dur="4.71">merchandise sold in that state online</text>
  <text start="170.97" dur="5.16">furniture retailer Wayfair along with</text>
  <text start="173.069" dur="5.581">overstock.com and online electronics</text>
  <text start="176.13" dur="7.59">retailer Newegg sued to block the law</text>
  <text start="178.65" dur="8.229">and won in lower court and the battle</text>
  <text start="183.72" dur="6.17">may not entirely be over</text>
  <text start="186.879" dur="6.041">the law could face legal challenges on</text>
  <text start="189.89" dur="5.76">other grounds and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="192.92" dur="4.019">right now is that these 45 states well</text>
  <text start="195.65" dur="4.14">at first they have to come up with their</text>
  <text start="196.939" dur="4.38">own laws to push sales tax and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="199.79" dur="4.11">think that will take very long but I</text>
  <text start="201.319" dur="4.76">think what&amp;#39;s going to happen is if this</text>
  <text start="203.9" dur="5.52">goes through and everyone starts</text>
  <text start="206.079" dur="5.621">charging sales tax this is going to hurt</text>
  <text start="209.42" dur="3.87">the online retailers I don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="211.7" dur="3.72">people are gonna go hey you know</text>
  <text start="213.29" dur="4.229">something I&amp;#39;m not gonna purchase online</text>
  <text start="215.42" dur="3.48">because it&amp;#39;s the same sales tax in the</text>
  <text start="217.519" dur="3.42">store so I&amp;#39;m just gonna go to the</text>
  <text start="218.9" dur="4.019">brick-and-mortar stores I think what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="220.939" dur="4.95">going to happen just like the tax on</text>
  <text start="222.919" dur="4.47">soda and I think out in other countries</text>
  <text start="225.889" dur="1.951">where there were taxes on retail I think</text>
  <text start="227.389" dur="3.78">in Japan</text>
  <text start="227.84" dur="4.769">all of a sudden sales plummeted I think</text>
  <text start="231.169" dur="3.781">the same thing is going to happen right</text>
  <text start="232.609" dur="5.52">now because we are on the edge where</text>
  <text start="234.95" dur="4.409">people no longer are making the amount</text>
  <text start="238.129" dur="2.79">of money where they can just go out and</text>
  <text start="239.359" dur="2.28">spend the money and just say hey I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="240.919" dur="2.611">really care</text>
  <text start="241.639" dur="3.33">they are very cautious and what they</text>
  <text start="243.53" dur="3.81">spend on this is why we see the</text>
  <text start="244.969" dur="5.281">brick-and-mortar and online or retail</text>
  <text start="247.34" dur="5.609">not doing that well and I think this is</text>
  <text start="250.25" dur="4.59">just going to hurt it yes I know the</text>
  <text start="252.949" dur="3.811">dollar signs look great and they can</text>
  <text start="254.84" dur="4.649">collect a lot of tax they saw this when</text>
  <text start="256.76" dur="5.46">they tax soda and other things but guess</text>
  <text start="259.489" dur="4.291">what happens people say you know</text>
  <text start="262.22" dur="4.59">something then I really don&amp;#39;t need it</text>
  <text start="263.78" dur="6.84">I&amp;#39;m not gonna buy it at all then and I</text>
  <text start="266.81" dur="5.91">believe this will happen because what</text>
  <text start="270.62" dur="4.889">we&amp;#39;re seeing in this economy is that</text>
  <text start="272.72" dur="4.229">it&amp;#39;s completely falling apart very very</text>
  <text start="275.509" dur="4.021">quickly everything is happening</text>
  <text start="276.949" dur="5.161">at the same time right now and all these</text>
  <text start="279.53" dur="5.58">other things added on top of it is not</text>
  <text start="282.11" dur="4.049">going to help I mean look at the housing</text>
  <text start="285.11" dur="3.66">market we&amp;#39;ve been talking about the</text>
  <text start="286.159" dur="3.651">housing market it is a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="288.77" dur="5.91">right now</text>
  <text start="289.81" dur="5.609">US homes are least affordable since 2008</text>
  <text start="294.68" dur="3.989">right now</text>
  <text start="295.419" dur="4.961">Adham Data Solutions released its second</text>
  <text start="298.669" dur="5.22">quarter 2018 housing affordability</text>
  <text start="300.38" dur="6.509">report show is that people just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="303.889" dur="4.981">have the funds to go out and pay for</text>
  <text start="306.889" dur="5.37">these expensive homes even though that</text>
  <text start="308.87" dur="5.94">the pace of home prices has slowed and</text>
  <text start="312.259" dur="6.001">it&amp;#39;s been dropping in some areas there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="314.81" dur="5.43">also been an 11% increase in mortgage</text>
  <text start="318.26" dur="3.3">rates compared with a year ago</text>
  <text start="320.24" dur="3.12">when we start to look at this and we</text>
  <text start="321.56" dur="3.93">start to see what&amp;#39;s going on here we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="323.36" dur="5.07">starting to see that retail breaking</text>
  <text start="325.49" dur="6.39">down real estate breaking down auto</text>
  <text start="328.43" dur="7.109">sales breaking down mortgage rates</text>
  <text start="331.88" dur="5.069">interest rates are moving up and the GDP</text>
  <text start="335.539" dur="4.291">numbers are completely fake phony and</text>
  <text start="336.949" dur="5.641">false because 70 percent of the GDP</text>
  <text start="339.83" dur="5.76">numbers are individuals purchasing in</text>
  <text start="342.59" dur="5.52">retail so if brick-and-mortar stores are</text>
  <text start="345.59" dur="5.79">closing and online sales are not getting</text>
  <text start="348.11" dur="6.149">the 1 to 1 ratio there is a problem here</text>
  <text start="351.38" dur="6.48">and when we look back here at real</text>
  <text start="354.259" dur="6">estate nationwide an average wage earner</text>
  <text start="357.86" dur="6.989">would need to spend around 30 1.2</text>
  <text start="360.259" dur="5.94">percent of their income to buy a medium</text>
  <text start="364.849" dur="4.111">priced home in the second quarter of</text>
  <text start="366.199" dur="6.78">2018 that&amp;#39;s above the historic average</text>
  <text start="368.96" dur="6.359">of 29.6% somebody earning the average</text>
  <text start="372.979" dur="8.011">wage wouldn&amp;#39;t qualify to buy a median</text>
  <text start="375.319" dur="9.84">price home in 326 roughly 75% of the 432</text>
  <text start="380.99" dur="7.53">county&amp;#39;s analyzed in this report so the</text>
  <text start="385.159" dur="7.32">situation is not good right now the</text>
  <text start="388.52" dur="6.42">situation is getting worse every single</text>
  <text start="392.479" dur="6.18">day and this summer is going to be</text>
  <text start="394.94" dur="5.4">absolutely awful in real estate compared</text>
  <text start="398.659" dur="3.781">to what happened last year and the year</text>
  <text start="400.34" dur="5.04">before that what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a</text>
  <text start="402.44" dur="5.909">decline in people going out and</text>
  <text start="405.38" dur="6.89">purchasing homes this is going to have</text>
  <text start="408.349" dur="9.051">an effect on other industries lumber</text>
  <text start="412.27" dur="11.29">plumbing electrical home furnishings you</text>
  <text start="417.4" dur="7.389">name it it&amp;#39;s all tied together and again</text>
  <text start="423.56" dur="3.389">if the banks aren&amp;#39;t loaning money</text>
  <text start="424.789" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re not making money so this is</text>
  <text start="426.949" dur="5.641">going to be a huge huge problem we see</text>
  <text start="430.009" dur="4.681">the Philly Fed it is crashed right now</text>
  <text start="432.59" dur="3.99">and when we look at this we can see it</text>
  <text start="434.69" dur="4.61">it&amp;#39;s plunged from thirty four point four</text>
  <text start="436.58" dur="6.29">to nineteen point no nineteen point nine</text>
  <text start="439.3" dur="6.609">well below expectations of twenty nine I</text>
  <text start="442.87" dur="4.9">mean this is just unbelievable right now</text>
  <text start="445.909" dur="5.43">and this is the biggest drop in the</text>
  <text start="447.77" dur="6.36">survey since February of 2014 and now</text>
  <text start="451.339" dur="6.541">it&amp;#39;s the weakest since November of 2016</text>
  <text start="454.13" dur="7.32">new orders also collapsed I mean this is</text>
  <text start="457.88" dur="6.71">just absolutely awful and now since this</text>
  <text start="461.45" dur="6.12">we see the dollar is now plunging</text>
  <text start="464.59" dur="6.64">everything is happening all at the same</text>
  <text start="467.57" dur="6.6">time now countries they realize that</text>
  <text start="471.23" dur="5.91">this system cannot last much longer and</text>
  <text start="474.17" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;ve been preparing for a very long</text>
  <text start="477.14" dur="3.48">time we talked about Russia before how</text>
  <text start="479.06" dur="4.02">they were selling their Treasury</text>
  <text start="480.62" dur="3.96">securities and they&amp;#39;re saying that they</text>
  <text start="483.08" dur="3.09">need to do this to protect the reserves</text>
  <text start="484.58" dur="3">basically what they&amp;#39;ve been doing is</text>
  <text start="486.17" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;ve been selling the Treasuries and</text>
  <text start="487.58" dur="5.16">buying gold and I&amp;#39;m not talking about</text>
  <text start="490.28" dur="4.16">paper gold paper contracts I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="492.74" dur="5.22">about physical gold</text>
  <text start="494.44" dur="6.79">so Russia sold more than any other major</text>
  <text start="497.96" dur="5.43">foreign holder of US debt so Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="501.23" dur="4.17">gold holdings have been steadily</text>
  <text start="503.39" dur="3.87">increasing bringing its share of the</text>
  <text start="505.4" dur="4.8">precious metal to its highest level in</text>
  <text start="507.26" dur="4.83">nearly two decades last month</text>
  <text start="510.2" dur="5.399">Russia&amp;#39;s gold holdings grew by one</text>
  <text start="512.09" dur="6.72">percent to 62 million troy ounces worth</text>
  <text start="515.599" dur="5.851">eighty point five billion now China</text>
  <text start="518.81" dur="5.67">could do the same thing if the trade war</text>
  <text start="521.45" dur="4.08">gets really bad and we see tariffs are</text>
  <text start="524.48" dur="3.03">being implemented</text>
  <text start="525.53" dur="5.4">China&amp;#39;s fighting back and this is all</text>
  <text start="527.51" dur="6.84">part of the plan they can do the same</text>
  <text start="530.93" dur="5.88">thing dump the Treasuries use that to</text>
  <text start="534.35" dur="4.44">purchase gold and basically what these</text>
  <text start="536.81" dur="4.77">countries are doing they&amp;#39;re getting out</text>
  <text start="538.79" dur="5.01">of US debt why are they doing this</text>
  <text start="541.58" dur="4.32">because they know once everything starts</text>
  <text start="543.8" dur="3.5">to go south the paper that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="545.9" dur="5.88">holding is going to be worth absolutely</text>
  <text start="547.3" dur="7.59">nothing and we see at this point while</text>
  <text start="551.78" dur="6.15">they do this they&amp;#39;re getting out of all</text>
  <text start="554.89" dur="6.16">US paper which means if there are</text>
  <text start="557.93" dur="4.44">sanctions placed on them it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt</text>
  <text start="561.05" dur="3.32">them because they can use other</text>
  <text start="562.37" dur="4.53">currencies they&amp;#39;re not holding that</text>
  <text start="564.37" dur="5.32">paper debt they&amp;#39;re not holding any</text>
  <text start="566.9" dur="6.24">anything like that and they can trade in</text>
  <text start="569.69" dur="7.65">gold they can trade in the ruble in the</text>
  <text start="573.14" dur="7.59">yuan or any other currency bypassing the</text>
  <text start="577.34" dur="6.27">sanctions completely so what we see</text>
  <text start="580.73" dur="5.01">happening right now is that countries</text>
  <text start="583.61" dur="3.3">are preparing they&amp;#39;re getting ready and</text>
  <text start="585.74" dur="2.16">they&amp;#39;ve been doing this for quite a</text>
  <text start="586.91" dur="4.17">while this is not something</text>
  <text start="587.9" dur="5.22">started yesterday they knew way back</text>
  <text start="591.08" dur="4.41">that there were problems is why China</text>
  <text start="593.12" dur="4.74">Russia and many other nations have been</text>
  <text start="595.49" dur="3.93">either purchasing gold or repatriating</text>
  <text start="597.86" dur="4.14">their gold because they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="599.42" dur="6.14">prepared for what is coming we also</text>
  <text start="602" dur="5.58">understand that all these economic</text>
  <text start="605.56" dur="5.26">statistics that are being thrown out</text>
  <text start="607.58" dur="5.79">there most of them are manipulated and I</text>
  <text start="610.82" dur="5.01">have to refer back to 2008</text>
  <text start="613.37" dur="4.68">one of the main statistics back then was</text>
  <text start="615.83" dur="4.94">how the triple how the subprime</text>
  <text start="618.05" dur="6">securities were triple-a that was a fake</text>
  <text start="620.77" dur="4.9">rating and they kept using that over and</text>
  <text start="624.05" dur="4.29">over and over saying that you know</text>
  <text start="625.67" dur="5.55">housing can&amp;#39;t go down the stock market</text>
  <text start="628.34" dur="5.85">can&amp;#39;t crash it&amp;#39;s impossible it will</text>
  <text start="631.22" dur="5.51">never happen and what we saw happen is</text>
  <text start="634.19" dur="5.1">that everything fell apart all at once</text>
  <text start="636.73" dur="4.54">even though unemployment was at one of</text>
  <text start="639.29" dur="4.77">its lowest points the stock market was</text>
  <text start="641.27" dur="5.43">at its highest point and the GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="644.06" dur="3.9">look good everything looked great people</text>
  <text start="646.7" dur="3.24">were going about their business</text>
  <text start="647.96" dur="5.13">until one day everyone woke up and</text>
  <text start="649.94" dur="4.74">everything started to fall apart and all</text>
  <text start="653.09" dur="3.9">of a sudden the stock market fell apart</text>
  <text start="654.68" dur="4.83">almost like the market has been coming</text>
  <text start="656.99" dur="4.65">down right now in the past couple of</text>
  <text start="659.51" dur="4.29">days the market has been dropping</text>
  <text start="661.64" dur="4.62">actually we haven&amp;#39;t hit any new highs in</text>
  <text start="663.8" dur="5.01">a very long time and the market</text>
  <text start="666.26" dur="4.98">continually comes down now what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="668.81" dur="5.37">to happen eventually is there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="671.24" dur="6.33">be panic selling and no matter what</text>
  <text start="674.18" dur="5.82">computer algorithm is set they will not</text>
  <text start="677.57" dur="5.04">be able to handle the amount of selling</text>
