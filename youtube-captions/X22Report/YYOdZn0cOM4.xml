  <text start="49.45" dur="6.9">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="53.05" dur="6.48">report my name is Dave and cepsa 1198 be</text>
  <text start="56.35" dur="5.07">and today&amp;#39;s date is February 7th 2017</text>
  <text start="59.53" dur="4.709">and the thought of the episode is the</text>
  <text start="61.42" dur="6.12">world is waking up in the elite do not</text>
  <text start="64.239" dur="5.791">like it let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="67.54" dur="5.79">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="70.03" dur="7.07">now we can see the opposition they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="73.33" dur="7.77">out there and they are using the word</text>
  <text start="77.1" dur="8.65">fascist fascism they&amp;#39;re comparing Trump</text>
  <text start="81.1" dur="6.96">to Adolf Hitler and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="85.75" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re really not using the word</text>
  <text start="88.06" dur="4.53">correctly</text>
  <text start="89.08" dur="5.58">in fact it&amp;#39;s true definition is</text>
  <text start="92.59" dur="4.11">irrelevant to all these individuals</text>
  <text start="94.66" dur="4.65">because all they care about is employing</text>
  <text start="96.7" dur="4.529">the nasty label as a scare tactic to</text>
  <text start="99.31" dur="4.71">paint Trump as a Nazi now</text>
  <text start="101.229" dur="5.851">merriam-webster defines the word fascism</text>
  <text start="104.02" dur="6.3">as a political philosophy movement or</text>
  <text start="107.08" dur="5.429">regime that exalts nation and often race</text>
  <text start="110.32" dur="4.079">above the individual and that stands for</text>
  <text start="112.509" dur="4.741">a centralized</text>
  <text start="114.399" dur="6.951">autocratic government headed by a dick</text>
  <text start="117.25" dur="7.259">toriel leader severe economic and social</text>
  <text start="121.35" dur="6.189">regimentation and forcible suppression</text>
  <text start="124.509" dur="6">of opposition the secondary definition</text>
  <text start="127.539" dur="5.28">is a tendency toward or actual exercise</text>
  <text start="130.509" dur="5.161">of strong autocratic or tutorial&amp;#39;</text>
  <text start="132.819" dur="5.25">control this definition stresses the</text>
  <text start="135.67" dur="5.7">fact that Nazis were fascists of the</text>
  <text start="138.069" dur="5.581">left who generally advocate for powerful</text>
  <text start="141.37" dur="4.26">central government as opposed to the</text>
  <text start="143.65" dur="4.41">rights preference for less intrusive</text>
  <text start="145.63" dur="5.76">government where power rests with the</text>
  <text start="148.06" dur="6.69">states and individuals now Google they</text>
  <text start="151.39" dur="5.19">decided we need to redefine this we need</text>
  <text start="154.75" dur="4.709">to create a definition that fits the</text>
  <text start="156.58" dur="4.14">narrative of the story so they decided</text>
  <text start="159.459" dur="3.181">to change it so if you go to Google and</text>
  <text start="160.72" dur="3.12">you type in fashion it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="162.64" dur="5.49">different than all the other</text>
  <text start="163.84" dur="7.8">dictionaries there&amp;#39;s is an authoritarian</text>
  <text start="168.13" dur="7.37">and nationalistic right-wing system of</text>
  <text start="171.64" dur="7.069">government and social organization and</text>
  <text start="175.5" dur="6.04">omitted the severe economic and social</text>
  <text start="178.709" dur="4.661">regimentation and forcible suppression</text>
  <text start="181.54" dur="4.169">of opposition they</text>
  <text start="183.37" dur="5.27">we move that part its secondary</text>
  <text start="185.709" dur="7.131">definition is extreme right-wing</text>
  <text start="188.64" dur="8.62">authoritarian or intolerant views or</text>
  <text start="192.84" dur="7">practice so they decided they were going</text>
  <text start="197.26" dur="5.37">to go ahead and just change it to fit</text>
  <text start="199.84" dur="7.56">the narrative of everyone using the word</text>
  <text start="202.63" dur="6.389">fascism completely changed and if Google</text>
  <text start="207.4" dur="4.169">says it&amp;#39;s right then it has to be of</text>
  <text start="209.019" dur="5.521">course it isn&amp;#39;t and we can see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="211.569" dur="7.2">happening right now the control the</text>
  <text start="214.54" dur="6.9">power behind the curtain well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="218.769" dur="5.041">trying to change things to show that yes</text>
  <text start="221.44" dur="5.1">Trump is a fascist</text>
  <text start="223.81" dur="6.78">yes Trump and the administration this is</text>
  <text start="226.54" dur="7.05">fascism when in reality when Obama was</text>
  <text start="230.59" dur="5.16">president that was fascism and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="233.59" dur="4.86">trying to switch everything so which</text>
  <text start="235.75" dur="5.19">everything around and we can see that</text>
  <text start="238.45" dur="4.59">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="240.94" dur="5.909">just out there making fun of everyone</text>
  <text start="243.04" dur="7.8">making fun of Kellyanne Conway if she</text>
  <text start="246.849" dur="7.14">you know says something come wrong like</text>
  <text start="250.84" dur="4.53">be Bowling Green massacre where she</text>
  <text start="253.989" dur="3.541">meant to say the Bowling Green Terrace</text>
  <text start="255.37" dur="3.57">you know they&amp;#39;re just honored completely</text>
  <text start="257.53" dur="4.82">making fun of it&amp;#39;s on the front page of</text>
  <text start="258.94" dur="7.74">CNN but when somebody in their camp</text>
  <text start="262.35" dur="4.95">decides or says something that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="266.68" dur="3.989">sound right</text>
  <text start="267.3" dur="4.54">you notice that the opposition they say</text>
  <text start="270.669" dur="4.861">nothing about it</text>
  <text start="271.84" dur="5.67">for example representative Maxine Waters</text>
  <text start="275.53" dur="6.62">she&amp;#39;s out there saying that Trump must</text>
  <text start="277.51" dur="7.62">be impeached because Putin invaded Korea</text>
  <text start="282.15" dur="5.38">she was out there and she&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="285.13" dur="6.539">Putin is killing people he&amp;#39;s invading</text>
  <text start="287.53" dur="5.639">Korea and right there and then she has</text>
  <text start="291.669" dur="4.051">no idea what she&amp;#39;s talking about she</text>
  <text start="293.169" dur="5.341">also went on to say that Putin is</text>
  <text start="295.72" dur="4.77">killing many many people she couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="298.51" dur="4.469">think of the word which was Aleppo and</text>
  <text start="300.49" dur="3.239">she&amp;#39;s killing you let Putin is killing</text>
  <text start="302.979" dur="3.781">innocent people</text>
  <text start="303.729" dur="5.821">now of course nothing about the United</text>
  <text start="306.76" dur="4.01">States bombing in this entire area</text>
  <text start="309.55" dur="3.75">nothing about the United States</text>
  <text start="310.77" dur="5.869">supporting terrorists nothing about any</text>
  <text start="313.3" dur="6.579">of that but again</text>
  <text start="316.639" dur="5.46">here&amp;#39;s an individual and she really has</text>
  <text start="319.879" dur="4.26">no idea what she&amp;#39;s talking about we also</text>
  <text start="322.099" dur="3.87">had Nancy Pelosi who was out there</text>
  <text start="324.139" dur="3.93">saying there&amp;#39;s nothing that I can work</text>
  <text start="325.969" dur="4.051">with with President Bush President Bush</text>
  <text start="328.069" dur="3.63">and I we just can&amp;#39;t get along there is</text>
  <text start="330.02" dur="3.359">nothing we can do and I can&amp;#39;t work with</text>
  <text start="331.699" dur="5.101">President Bush what you really meant to</text>
  <text start="333.379" dur="6.72">say was President Trump but again here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="336.8" dur="5.31">two individuals that messed up but you</text>
  <text start="340.099" dur="3.241">don&amp;#39;t see the alternative media you</text>
  <text start="342.11" dur="3.6">don&amp;#39;t see everyone out there making fun</text>
  <text start="343.34" dur="3.9">of them like they&amp;#39;re doing with Kelly</text>
  <text start="345.71" dur="5.25">and Conway because you have to remember</text>
  <text start="347.24" dur="4.56">we have to go back to Gandhi and Arthur</text>
  <text start="350.96" dur="4.35">Schopenhauer</text>
  <text start="351.8" dur="6.299">where they say truth is ridiculed in the</text>
  <text start="355.31" dur="4.05">bidding it&amp;#39;s made fun of and this is the</text>
  <text start="358.099" dur="3.741">step that we&amp;#39;re in right now where</text>
  <text start="359.36" dur="5.669">they&amp;#39;re just out there making fun of</text>
  <text start="361.84" dur="5.079">everything that&amp;#39;s coming out now in</text>
  <text start="365.029" dur="4.17">regards to the immigration ban we see</text>
  <text start="366.919" dur="4.37">that Trump well he&amp;#39;s ready to take it</text>
  <text start="369.199" dur="4.201">all the way to the Supreme Court and</text>
  <text start="371.289" dur="4.03">he&amp;#39;s hoping that he doesn&amp;#39;t have to take</text>
  <text start="373.4" dur="5.28">it that far he&amp;#39;s hoping that this will</text>
  <text start="375.319" dur="7.891">be settled much sooner than that but he</text>
  <text start="378.68" dur="6.659">will push it to that area now something</text>
  <text start="383.21" dur="6.66">very interesting where there was a</text>
  <text start="385.339" dur="8.58">California Senate leader who admits half</text>
  <text start="389.87" dur="8.789">of my family in the US is here illegally</text>
  <text start="393.919" dur="7.351">with false social security cards now he</text>
  <text start="398.659" dur="5.19">was giving testimony in front of the</text>
  <text start="401.27" dur="3.09">California Senate Public Safety</text>
  <text start="403.849" dur="4.111">Committee</text>
  <text start="404.36" dur="7.229">this was Senate President Kevin de Leon</text>
  <text start="407.96" dur="5.699">and he decided to admit that half of his</text>
  <text start="411.589" dur="5.781">family is residing in the United States</text>
  <text start="413.659" dur="6.06">illegally and they have falsified</text>
  <text start="417.37" dur="5.859">documentation Social Security green</text>
  <text start="419.719" dur="6.181">cards licenses everything and he said I</text>
  <text start="423.229" dur="5.22">can tell you half of my family would be</text>
  <text start="425.9" dur="5.519">eligible for deportation under Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="428.449" dur="5.551">executive order because they got a false</text>

  <text start="450.65" dur="6.42">and they falsified documentation to work</text>
  <text start="453.949" dur="8.22">and they&amp;#39;re worried about being deported</text>
  <text start="457.07" dur="7.819">if Trump pushes the executive order</text>
  <text start="462.169" dur="5.431">forward and tries to get it reinstated</text>
  <text start="464.889" dur="6.81">well first of all they&amp;#39;re here illegally</text>
  <text start="467.6" dur="9.439">and they&amp;#39;re using fake documentation I</text>
  <text start="471.699" dur="8.351">mean this doesn&amp;#39;t bother anyone else</text>
  <text start="477.039" dur="5.371">they should be deported and they</text>
  <text start="480.05" dur="4.98">shouldn&amp;#39;t be working it&amp;#39;s all fake</text>
  <text start="482.41" dur="4.99">documentation now the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="485.03" dur="5.34">out there and they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="487.4" dur="5.07">us with their polls that America does</text>
  <text start="490.37" dur="4.14">more does not want strong immigration</text>
  <text start="492.47" dur="5.13">they don&amp;#39;t want extreme vetting and what</text>
  <text start="494.51" dur="4.77">I mean by extreme vetting is vetting</text>
  <text start="497.6" dur="4.379">these individuals to make sure that</text>
  <text start="499.28" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re not terrorists they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="501.979" dur="5.461">diseases they they&amp;#39;re not rapists</text>
  <text start="504.56" dur="7.919">they&amp;#39;re not criminals or anything else</text>
  <text start="507.44" dur="8.01">like that and we see out in Europe the</text>
  <text start="512.479" dur="7.141">polls out there well 55 percent of</text>
  <text start="515.45" dur="6.899">Europeans they agree with Trump that the</text>
  <text start="519.62" dur="5.1">ban should be in place here in the US</text>
  <text start="522.349" dur="5.251">and in their country and there was a</text>
  <text start="524.72" dur="4.65">poll that was taken called the Chatham</text>
  <text start="527.6" dur="5.28">House survey of more than 10,000 people</text>
  <text start="529.37" dur="5.13">from 10 European states and they wanted</text>
  <text start="532.88" dur="7.05">to know you know what they were thinking</text>
  <text start="534.5" dur="7.23">and the results were that across all ten</text>
  <text start="539.93" dur="4.2">of the European countries an average 55%</text>
  <text start="541.73" dur="4.109">agreed that all further migration from</text>
  <text start="544.13" dur="2.399">mainly Muslim countries should be</text>
  <text start="545.839" dur="5.991">stopped</text>
  <text start="546.529" dur="7.711">25% neither agreed nor disagreed and 20%</text>
  <text start="551.83" dur="5.699">disagreed and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="554.24" dur="7.32">information from these polls we see that</text>
  <text start="557.529" dur="7.091">71% in Poland well they agreed 65 in</text>
  <text start="561.56" dur="6.63">Austria 53 percent in Germany 51 percent</text>
  <text start="564.62" dur="8.219">in Italy 47 percent in United Kingdom 41</text>
  <text start="568.19" dur="8.79">percent in Spain and this wasn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="572.839" dur="6.931">only poll a Pew survey of 10 European</text>
  <text start="576.98" dur="7.41">countries in 2016 was also taken and</text>
  <text start="579.77" dur="7.2">guess what they got the same results</text>
  <text start="584.39" dur="5.46">we took a poll on the x-22 report.com</text>
  <text start="586.97" dur="5.97">site and the new Sentinel site and we</text>
  <text start="589.85" dur="7.83">see that out of a thousand 84 people</text>
  <text start="592.94" dur="6.75">that took the poll 94% said yes they</text>
  <text start="597.68" dur="5.76">want strong immigration and extreme</text>
  <text start="599.69" dur="6.209">vetting four percent said no 2% was</text>
  <text start="603.44" dur="4.25">undecided now this is very interesting</text>
  <text start="605.899" dur="4.38">because the corporate media polls are</text>
  <text start="607.69" dur="5.44">completely different than the Pew survey</text>
  <text start="610.279" dur="5.881">poll the Chatham House and the poll we</text>
  <text start="613.13" dur="6.449">took on the x-22 report comp site so the</text>
  <text start="616.16" dur="6.15">question is who&amp;#39;s lying didn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="619.579" dur="5.221">corporate media also lie about the polls</text>
  <text start="622.31" dur="6.019">during the election and they were</text>
  <text start="624.8" dur="6.93">completely wrong yes they did</text>
  <text start="628.329" dur="5.411">Austria right now well they&amp;#39;re ready to</text>
  <text start="631.73" dur="4.41">send troops to other European countries</text>
  <text start="633.74" dur="6.63">to keep the migrants out and we have to</text>
  <text start="636.14" dur="5.819">remember how all of this started it was</text>
  <text start="640.37" dur="3.18">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="641.959" dur="3.901">bankers that went into these countries</text>
  <text start="643.55" dur="5.46">and created wars in each one of these</text>
  <text start="645.86" dur="5.88">countries the immigration the refugee</text>
  <text start="649.01" dur="5.48">problem throughout Europe well that was</text>
  <text start="651.74" dur="6.39">created by the US and Turkey at the time</text>
  <text start="654.49" dur="7.089">Turkey was taking all the refugees from</text>
  <text start="658.13" dur="6.569">Syria from Iraq holding them in their</text>
  <text start="661.579" dur="5.69">country and then George Soros and the</text>
  <text start="664.699" dur="6.45">United States said ok now release them</text>
  <text start="667.269" dur="5.141">into Europe and this was part of agenda</text>
  <text start="671.149" dur="3.511">and this is why all of a sudden we saw</text>
  <text start="672.41" dur="7.619">this mad rush of refugees and all these</text>
  <text start="674.66" dur="9.6">immigrants flowing through Europe this</text>
  <text start="680.029" dur="7.291">was all planned and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="684.26" dur="6.21">that the people are saying whoa hold on</text>
  <text start="687.32" dur="5.16">here we just can&amp;#39;t have everyone just</text>
  <text start="690.47" dur="7.59">coming in without any type of check</text>
  <text start="692.48" dur="8.88">without any type of process to make sure</text>
  <text start="698.06" dur="5.13">that you know we&amp;#39;re not getting</text>
  <text start="701.36" dur="6.27">terrorists we&amp;#39;re not getting criminals</text>
  <text start="703.19" dur="6.12">we&amp;#39;re not getting the drug cartel and we</text>
  <text start="707.63" dur="3.329">see right now that people are standing</text>
  <text start="709.31" dur="3.6">up at the corporate media the opposition</text>
  <text start="710.959" dur="6.24">they&amp;#39;re out there trying to convince</text>
  <text start="712.91" dur="5.88">everyone no it is the opposite way now</text>
  <text start="717.199" dur="4.501">Twitter is long</text>
  <text start="718.79" dur="5.79">this new technology to fight abusive</text>
  <text start="721.7" dur="6.06">accounts and suppress the low quality</text>
  <text start="724.58" dur="4.699">ones now we don&amp;#39;t know what that really</text>
  <text start="727.76" dur="4.5">means what&amp;#39;s low quality</text>
  <text start="729.279" dur="7.211">what does abusive accounts really mean</text>
