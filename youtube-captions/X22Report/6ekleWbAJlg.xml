  <text start="63.67" dur="5.8">2017 and the title of the episode is so</text>
  <text start="67.43" dur="6.15">it begins the central banks will not</text>
  <text start="69.47" dur="5.88">stop until you are convinced let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="73.58" dur="4.05">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="75.35" dur="3.659">news now as we know there are many</text>
  <text start="77.63" dur="3.57">things happening in the economy right</text>
  <text start="79.009" dur="4.561">now first of all the actual people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="81.2" dur="4.169">economy it is breaking down yes there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="83.57" dur="4.26">manipulation going on in yesterday we</text>
  <text start="85.369" dur="4.351">talked about the retail numbers and all</text>
  <text start="87.83" dur="3.87">the different aspects of how the economy</text>
  <text start="89.72" dur="3.72">is breaking down and different</text>
  <text start="91.7" dur="3.57">indicators that we&amp;#39;ve been seeing where</text>
  <text start="93.44" dur="3.929">everything is continually breaking down</text>
  <text start="95.27" dur="3.72">now of course the corporate media fed</text>
  <text start="97.369" dur="5.821">the the government they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="98.99" dur="5.4">continually use the the manipulation to</text>
  <text start="103.19" dur="2.789">their benefit where they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="104.39" dur="3.509">manipulate the news they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="105.979" dur="3.81">manipulate the statistics that Khanum a</text>
  <text start="107.899" dur="4.14">plate everything to convince you that</text>
  <text start="109.789" dur="4.531">everything is fine here in the United</text>
  <text start="112.039" dur="4.921">States but it is not actually not just</text>
  <text start="114.32" dur="4.38">the United States but the world and the</text>
  <text start="116.96" dur="4.92">reason for this is because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="118.7" dur="6.93">planning to shift everything to a new</text>
  <text start="121.88" dur="6.299">system and part of this most likely is</text>
  <text start="125.63" dur="4.889">going to be a crypto system now again</text>
  <text start="128.179" dur="4.771">the crypto system is a fantastic system</text>
  <text start="130.519" dur="4.261">it&amp;#39;s completely decentralized in the</text>
  <text start="132.95" dur="3.539">hands of the people it would work very</text>
  <text start="134.78" dur="3.39">well it would take everything out of the</text>
  <text start="136.489" dur="3.661">bankers and move it to the people</text>
  <text start="138.17" dur="3.93">same thing with gold and silver the</text>
  <text start="140.15" dur="3.059">problem is is that central bankers once</text>
  <text start="142.1" dur="2.52">they get their hands on it</text>
  <text start="143.209" dur="4.291">this is where things start to go south</text>
  <text start="144.62" dur="4.05">and we can see right now and if you</text>
  <text start="147.5" dur="2.73">really look at the evidence and you</text>
  <text start="148.67" dur="4.02">really look at what they&amp;#39;re doing you</text>
  <text start="150.23" dur="5.64">can see how they are maneuvering to</text>
  <text start="152.69" dur="7.139">convince everyone that not the</text>
  <text start="155.87" dur="5.69">blockchain system but Bitcoin or any</text>
  <text start="159.829" dur="4.021">other cryptocurrency that is not</text>
  <text start="161.56" dur="6.87">regulated by the central bank</text>
  <text start="163.85" dur="7.65">well that is evil you can&amp;#39;t work with it</text>
  <text start="168.43" dur="6.01">it&amp;#39;s volatile you can lose a lot of</text>
  <text start="171.5" dur="6">money and you&amp;#39;re gonna need someone to</text>
  <text start="174.44" dur="5.1">manage it now we saw the crypto</text>
  <text start="177.5" dur="4.41">currencies they were born Bitcoin came</text>
  <text start="179.54" dur="4.529">out people really didn&amp;#39;t know what it</text>
  <text start="181.91" dur="4.17">was when it first started and then it</text>
  <text start="184.069" dur="3.121">people started to realize okay I see</text>
  <text start="186.08" dur="2.97">what this is</text>
  <text start="187.19" dur="3.12">it&amp;#39;s a whole ledger system decentralized</text>
  <text start="189.05" dur="3.72">with different servers around the world</text>
  <text start="190.31" dur="4.86">and you can trade and purchase goods</text>
  <text start="192.77" dur="4.92">with these coins they&amp;#39;re digital coins</text>
  <text start="195.17" dur="5.82">and other cryptocurrency started to come</text>
  <text start="197.69" dur="6.09">out where you have salt you have - you</text>
  <text start="200.99" dur="5.16">have light coin you have bit cash and</text>
  <text start="203.78" dur="4.35">you have you know hundreds and hundreds</text>
  <text start="206.15" dur="3.54">of other ones that most of them don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="208.13" dur="3.63">even do anything it reminds me of the</text>
  <text start="209.69" dur="4.35">internet when internet sites were just</text>
  <text start="211.76" dur="4.02">popping up and most of them they could</text>
  <text start="214.04" dur="2.97">make a dime they weren&amp;#39;t worth anything</text>
  <text start="215.78" dur="2.85">they were just popping up all over the</text>
  <text start="217.01" dur="3.45">place and everyone was really making a</text>
  <text start="218.63" dur="3.42">really big deal out of them and nothing</text>
  <text start="220.46" dur="3.6">really came about that most of them went</text>
  <text start="222.05" dur="5.19">out of business but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="224.06" dur="5.43">right now is that the central banking</text>
  <text start="227.24" dur="5.73">system those people that who are</text>
  <text start="229.49" dur="6.47">handling the economy of the world they</text>
  <text start="232.97" dur="5.07">want to be in control of the currency</text>
  <text start="235.96" dur="4.75">plain and simple that&amp;#39;s what they want</text>
  <text start="238.04" dur="4.26">to do so what they&amp;#39;ve done and this is</text>
  <text start="240.71" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;re starting to see the big picture</text>
  <text start="242.3" dur="5.7">right now where they&amp;#39;ve been most likely</text>
  <text start="245.51" dur="3.99">using free money just like they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="248" dur="3.959">with the stock market they&amp;#39;ve been using</text>
  <text start="249.5" dur="5.76">free money where they create this money</text>
  <text start="251.959" dur="6.661">out of thin air and they&amp;#39;re using it to</text>
  <text start="255.26" dur="4.68">basically pump up Bitcoin just like they</text>
  <text start="258.62" dur="2.58">do with the stock market just like they</text>
  <text start="259.94" dur="3.66">do with the housing market just like</text>
  <text start="261.2" dur="4.38">they do with pretty much everything and</text>
  <text start="263.6" dur="4.319">what they can do is they can make this</text>
  <text start="265.58" dur="5.22">market go higher and higher now people</text>
  <text start="267.919" dur="4.801">feel good when it&amp;#39;s going higher when</text>
  <text start="270.8" dur="3.869">you&amp;#39;re seeing it going up this fast you</text>
  <text start="272.72" dur="4.29">have to question it you know is this a</text>
  <text start="274.669" dur="3.541">bubble isn&amp;#39;t it a bubble how many people</text>
  <text start="277.01" dur="3.57">know about it how many people are</text>
  <text start="278.21" dur="4.32">invested in it and when you look at it</text>
  <text start="280.58" dur="6.48">you can see why the central bankers</text>
  <text start="282.53" dur="6.33">would want everyone to get involved with</text>
  <text start="287.06" dur="4.59">it and if they can&amp;#39;t get involved with</text>
  <text start="288.86" dur="4.98">it they want it blast it out on the</text>
  <text start="291.65" dur="4.65">court media on how fast bitcoin is going</text>
  <text start="293.84" dur="4.95">up think about why they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="296.3" dur="7.26">think about why they would need to do</text>
  <text start="298.79" dur="6.3">this now as Bitcoin moves up they start</text>
  <text start="303.56" dur="3.69">putting out articles we&amp;#39;ve seen it in</text>
  <text start="305.09" dur="4.53">different publications where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="307.25" dur="5.76">saying that the Fed is looking to create</text>
  <text start="309.62" dur="5.64">fed coin they&amp;#39;re looking to maybe well</text>
  <text start="313.01" dur="6.029">actually they have developed the other</text>
  <text start="315.26" dur="5.309">type of coin which is the utilities</text>
  <text start="319.039" dur="3.421">settlement coin there&amp;#39;s these</text>
  <text start="320.569" dur="4.74">big banks that have been working on this</text>
  <text start="322.46" dur="4.829">for quite a while and we can see that as</text>
  <text start="325.309" dur="4.47">they continually pump this up and it</text>
  <text start="327.289" dur="3.75">drops they can say see how volatile it</text>
  <text start="329.779" dur="3">is and then it moves up again people</text>
  <text start="331.039" dur="3.481">feel comfortable about it the corporate</text>
  <text start="332.779" dur="3.36">media reports on it and this is what</text>
  <text start="334.52" dur="3.599">they want they want this out in the</text>
  <text start="336.139" dur="4.29">public they want people to know even if</text>
  <text start="338.119" dur="4.621">there&amp;#39;s not a lot of investors working</text>
  <text start="340.429" dur="6">with Bitcoin they just want the public</text>
  <text start="342.74" dur="5.28">to know what is going on here and then</text>
  <text start="346.429" dur="3.39">what they&amp;#39;re gonna do is they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="348.02" dur="3.75">start to demonize it and we&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="349.819" dur="4.41">seen this they&amp;#39;re already saying well</text>
  <text start="351.77" dur="6.149">look bitcoin is used for the wanna cry</text>
  <text start="354.229" dur="6.24">malware where you can basically shut</text>
  <text start="357.919" dur="4.92">down system across you know the world</text>
  <text start="360.469" dur="3.48">and ask for ransom to get your system</text>
  <text start="362.839" dur="2.61">back online and of course that they</text>
  <text start="363.949" dur="4.05">linked this to North Korea but that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="365.449" dur="4.14">whole different story and what they</text>
  <text start="367.999" dur="3.991">start to do is they start to demonize</text>
  <text start="369.589" dur="6.06">this and the Washington Post they began</text>
  <text start="371.99" dur="6.779">an article where they started to talk</text>
  <text start="375.649" dur="5.01">about Bitcoin and this is an excerpt</text>
  <text start="378.769" dur="4.32">from the article from the post that just</text>
  <text start="380.659" dur="7.831">published entitled bitcoins boom is a</text>
  <text start="383.089" dur="6.841">boon for extremist groups and when you</text>
  <text start="388.49" dur="6.049">look at this you can say well what is</text>
  <text start="389.93" dur="10.379">this well it goes on to say that raices</text>
  <text start="394.539" dur="8.5">criminals tax evaders drug dealers they</text>
  <text start="400.309" dur="4.98">are going to use Bitcoin they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="403.039" dur="5.94">to use it they will take advantage of it</text>
  <text start="405.289" dur="6.6">and basically this is the choice of</text>
  <text start="408.979" dur="4.47">currency that they will use now this is</text>
  <text start="411.889" dur="3.87">the part where they&amp;#39;re demonizing</text>
  <text start="413.449" dur="3.84">Bitcoin because they want people to</text>
  <text start="415.759" dur="3.06">understand and this is why it&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="417.289" dur="5.28">out of the corporate media they want</text>
  <text start="418.819" dur="5.7">people to understand who uses this type</text>
  <text start="422.569" dur="4.55">of cryptocurrency they&amp;#39;re not talking</text>
  <text start="424.519" dur="6.781">about the blockchain they&amp;#39;re just saying</text>
  <text start="427.119" dur="6.55">Bitcoin or certain cryptocurrencies that</text>
  <text start="431.3" dur="6.719">the central banks are not in control of</text>
  <text start="433.669" dur="6.03">and we can see right now this is what</text>
  <text start="438.019" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re planning so they pump it up</text>
  <text start="439.699" dur="2.7">and they make everyone feel good they</text>
  <text start="441.139" dur="2.791">drop it a little bit they pump it up</text>
  <text start="442.399" dur="3.841">they drop it a little bit they show how</text>
  <text start="443.93" dur="4.529">it&amp;#39;s so volatile that it can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="446.24" dur="3.959">controlled and they want more and more</text>
  <text start="448.459" dur="4.14">people to understand that yeah this is a</text>
  <text start="450.199" dur="3.631">problem here then they demonize it well</text>
  <text start="452.599" dur="3.121">this is bad</text>
  <text start="453.83" dur="4.519">countries like North Korea use it</text>
  <text start="455.72" dur="5.55">terrorists and others racists and and</text>
  <text start="458.349" dur="3.94">drug dealers they use this this is why</text>
  <text start="461.27" dur="2.76">we need to get rid of it if you would</text>
  <text start="462.289" dur="6.391">look at this this is what they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="464.03" dur="8.31">with cash where they can go to a digital</text>
  <text start="468.68" dur="5.639">currency system well they&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="472.34" dur="4.859">same thing with cryptocurrency with</text>
  <text start="474.319" dur="5.85">Bitcoin in particular and they want you</text>
  <text start="477.199" dur="4.051">to see how bad this is you know</text>
  <text start="480.169" dur="4.321">eventually what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="481.25" dur="4.949">after their ongoing demonization is</text>
  <text start="484.49" dur="3.739">finished what they&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
  <text start="486.199" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re gonna come in and say look</text>
  <text start="488.229" dur="6.37">Bitcoin just fell apart and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="491.629" dur="6.72">gonna fall by 300 or 500 it might even</text>
  <text start="494.599" dur="6">come down halfway I&amp;#39;m not saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="498.349" dur="4.651">going to but it looks like this could be</text>
  <text start="500.599" dur="5.1">their plan where they bring it down</text>
  <text start="503" dur="5.219">halfway to show you hey look this is</text>
  <text start="505.699" dur="5.131">really volatile this is not stable</text>
  <text start="508.219" dur="4.26">people shouldn&amp;#39;t be in it it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="510.83" dur="4.47">difficult to regulate because we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="512.479" dur="4.531">have control over this and it looks like</text>
  <text start="515.3" dur="4.32">what they&amp;#39;re going to try to do is</text>
  <text start="517.01" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re going to present this to</text>
  <text start="519.62" dur="4.02">Congress and other countries are going</text>
  <text start="522.02" dur="5.43">to present this in to their government</text>
  <text start="523.64" dur="6.09">bodies and say listen we need to control</text>
  <text start="527.45" dur="5.28">the system we need to use the utility</text>
  <text start="529.73" dur="3.93">settlement coin or the Fed coin whatever</text>
  <text start="532.73" dur="3.15">they come up with there might be</text>
  <text start="533.66" dur="3.63">multiple ones where different countries</text>
  <text start="535.88" dur="4.17">use different ones just like they&amp;#39;d have</text>
  <text start="537.29" dur="5.37">different currencies today and we can</text>
  <text start="540.05" dur="5.46">see that this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="542.66" dur="5.369">trying to do now this is the push they</text>
  <text start="545.51" dur="4.079">are using to convince everyone now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="548.029" dur="4.531">very interesting and I said this before</text>
  <text start="549.589" dur="4.921">China and Russia they&amp;#39;re still part of</text>
  <text start="552.56" dur="5.19">the central banking system the BRICS</text>
  <text start="554.51" dur="4.92">system is so part of the system and what</text>
  <text start="557.75" dur="5.16">is happening right now is everything is</text>
  <text start="559.43" dur="5.909">moving from the west to the east at the</text>
  <text start="562.91" dur="4.02">same time they realize in the central</text>
  <text start="565.339" dur="4.051">bankers realized because they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="566.93" dur="5.219">there doing this we need to have some</text>
  <text start="569.39" dur="5.629">type of low-level digital currency where</text>
  <text start="572.149" dur="6.271">the people are able to use this to trade</text>
  <text start="575.019" dur="4.721">now we&amp;#39;ll have a high-level currency</text>
  <text start="578.42" dur="3.779">where the countries will be able to</text>
  <text start="579.74" dur="4.589">trade but we need a low-level currency</text>
  <text start="582.199" dur="4.351">where people can trade and do business</text>
  <text start="584.329" dur="3.331">and it looks like this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="586.55" dur="2.67">trying to do and this is why</text>
  <text start="587.66" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re continually pushing the idea</text>
  <text start="589.22" dur="4.92">that bitcoin is scary you shouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="592.1" dur="4.17">it but i think bitcoin is good if the</text>
  <text start="594.14" dur="4.77">central bankers you know take their</text>
  <text start="596.27" dur="4.14">hands off of it and let the people use</text>
  <text start="598.91" dur="3.21">it I think all the cryptocurrencies are</text>
  <text start="600.41" dur="2.67">pretty darn good I mean some of them are</text>
  <text start="602.12" dur="2.97">worthless they&amp;#39;re gonna just disappear</text>
  <text start="603.08" dur="3.87">but there are many that are very very</text>
  <text start="605.09" dur="4.41">good that could be used for many</text>
  <text start="606.95" dur="4.47">different things and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="609.5" dur="6.42">right now is the BRIC countries and the</text>

  <text start="615.92" dur="4.14">been proposed by the Central Bank of</text>
  <text start="617.51" dur="6.99">Russia to maybe have their own</text>
  <text start="620.06" dur="6.87">cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency looks</text>
  <text start="624.5" dur="5.22">very promising it looks like we&amp;#39;re we</text>
  <text start="626.93" dur="5.58">could use this to stabilize the currency</text>
  <text start="629.72" dur="5.25">system and it looks like the central</text>
  <text start="632.51" dur="5.43">banks there which is where the central</text>
  <text start="634.97" dur="5.49">banks are going to be located we can can</text>
  <text start="637.94" dur="4.53">control this now it looks like they</text>
  <text start="640.46" dur="4.92">might have a cryptocurrency for Russia</text>
  <text start="642.47" dur="4.71">for the BRICS there might be a separate</text>
  <text start="645.38" dur="4.38">cryptocurrency for the United States</text>
  <text start="647.18" dur="4.41">there might be one for Canada and people</text>
  <text start="649.76" dur="4.71">will use these cryptocurrencies to trade</text>
  <text start="651.59" dur="5.34">back and forth I&amp;#39;m not saying that this</text>
  <text start="654.47" dur="5.97">is all set in stone but this is what the</text>
  <text start="656.93" dur="6.75">central bankers want eventually as we</text>
  <text start="660.44" dur="5.76">enter this transition this is what</text>
  <text start="663.68" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re going to try to do they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="666.2" dur="4.47">just forget about take Oh take away the</text>
  <text start="668.03" dur="4.14">technology take away computers take away</text>
  <text start="670.67" dur="5.43">just think of the currency it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="672.17" dur="5.97">currency okay just like the dollar just</text>
  <text start="676.1" dur="4.38">like the Euro just like all the</text>
  <text start="678.14" dur="5.25">different currencies before the central</text>
  <text start="680.48" dur="5.61">bank&amp;#39;s were involved in 1913 the</text>
  <text start="683.39" dur="5.01">government the people issued the</text>
  <text start="686.09" dur="5.82">currency there was no interest attached</text>
  <text start="688.4" dur="6.54">and everything could be accounted for it</text>
  <text start="691.91" dur="5.97">was backed by gold the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="694.94" dur="6.57">wanted to get involved and they made</text>
  <text start="697.88" dur="5.55">their play by telling you how the system</text>
  <text start="701.51" dur="5.16">can&amp;#39;t stay afloat and who made the stock</text>
  <text start="703.43" dur="4.62">market crash they got involved in</text>
  <text start="706.67" dur="6.51">certain things and they were able to</text>
  <text start="708.05" dur="8.34">manipulate the economy to force the u.s.</text>
  <text start="713.18" dur="6.27">into going with what they wanted that is</text>
  <text start="716.39" dur="4">control of the currency the same thing</text>
  <text start="719.45" dur="5.38">is happening</text>
  <text start="720.39" dur="6.51">now where something came out the people</text>
  <text start="724.83" dur="4.37">are controlling it people are getting</text>
  <text start="726.9" dur="6.12">involved more people want to use it and</text>
  <text start="729.2" dur="5.95">they don&amp;#39;t want this to happen this is</text>
  <text start="733.02" dur="4.38">why they&amp;#39;re doing this it&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="735.15" dur="4.74">thing we&amp;#39;re actually just repeating what</text>
  <text start="737.4" dur="5.1">happened prior to 1913 and before the</text>
  <text start="739.89" dur="4.47">you know the US central bank to this US</text>
  <text start="742.5" dur="4.11">central bank one going all the way back</text>
  <text start="744.36" dur="5.73">in time to the British government the</text>
  <text start="746.61" dur="5.46">same exact thing is happening where they</text>
  <text start="750.09" dur="3.18">want control now we&amp;#39;re going to be going</text>
  <text start="752.07" dur="3.84">through this transition and no matter</text>
  <text start="753.27" dur="5.21">what we&amp;#39;re gonna have a very bumpy rough</text>
  <text start="755.91" dur="4.92">time going through this transition and</text>
  <text start="758.48" dur="4.99">do we know what exactly what currency</text>
  <text start="760.83" dur="6.24">we&amp;#39;re gonna end up with no and this is</text>
  <text start="763.47" dur="8.13">why we need to protect ourselves now we</text>
  <text start="767.07" dur="5.52">know that the China and the BRICS</text>
  <text start="771.6" dur="5.01">there&amp;#39;s going to be starting their own</text>
  <text start="772.59" dur="5.55">trading system in gold and we understand</text>
  <text start="776.61" dur="3.69">that Russia and China they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="778.14" dur="3.84">purchasing a lot of gold we understand</text>
  <text start="780.3" dur="3.81">there&amp;#39;s a petrol you want you can see</text>
  <text start="781.98" dur="5.01">how this is all taking shape right now</text>
  <text start="784.11" dur="6.27">where everything pretty much looks like</text>
  <text start="786.99" dur="6.93">the US but it&amp;#39;s in China everything that</text>
  <text start="790.38" dur="5.73">we have here in the United States looks</text>
  <text start="793.92" dur="4.98">pretty much the same that&amp;#39;s in China now</text>
  <text start="796.11" dur="5.55">and they&amp;#39;re starting to deal outside of</text>
  <text start="798.9" dur="5.7">the dollar using the petrol yuan the</text>
  <text start="801.66" dur="5.79">United States had the world&amp;#39;s gold after</text>
  <text start="804.6" dur="4.68">World War two now Russia and China have</text>
  <text start="807.45" dur="4.83">a lot of gold and people say that United</text>
  <text start="809.28" dur="4.47">States has no gold so you can see how</text>
  <text start="812.28" dur="3.36">everything has been duplicated the</text>
  <text start="813.75" dur="3.6">trading system the shanghai gold</text>
  <text start="815.64" dur="4.01">exchange they&amp;#39;re starting this BRICS</text>
  <text start="817.35" dur="6.09">trading system and if they can basically</text>
  <text start="819.65" dur="6.55">revalue gold guess what they have a lot</text>
  <text start="823.44" dur="4.65">of it now they voted at 1100 1200 900</text>
  <text start="826.2" dur="5.58">you know whatever they purchase their</text>
  <text start="828.09" dur="6.87">goal that it&amp;#39;s just gonna go up and they</text>
  <text start="831.78" dur="6.3">will have the country&amp;#39;s currency backed</text>
  <text start="834.96" dur="6.18">by gold which will allow the world to</text>
  <text start="838.08" dur="4.89">say okay this is safe then at a lower</text>
  <text start="841.14" dur="3.9">level what they&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
  <text start="842.97" dur="5.9">they&amp;#39;re going to try to control the</text>
  <text start="845.04" dur="8.16">crypto markets by having government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="848.87" dur="5.84">say yes the only currency that you can</text>
  <text start="853.2" dur="6.58">use in the crypto more</text>
  <text start="854.71" dur="9.56">to get paid in to purchasing to do any</text>
  <text start="859.78" dur="7.62">type of transaction is the Fed coin or</text>
  <text start="864.27" dur="5.83">any other type of cryptocurrency like</text>
  <text start="867.4" dur="6.59">the utility settlement coin everything</text>
  <text start="870.1" dur="7.14">else is meaningless it&amp;#39;s a commodity so</text>
  <text start="873.99" dur="6.1">you can&amp;#39;t transact business it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="877.24" dur="5.31">like all the other commodities and as</text>
  <text start="880.09" dur="4.98">long as they have that can control all</text>
  <text start="882.55" dur="4.26">the businesses everyone that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="885.07" dur="6.09">transacting for goods and stuff like</text>
  <text start="886.81" dur="6.9">that you can only use their currency</text>
  <text start="891.16" dur="5.46">system in the crypto market and</text>
  <text start="893.71" dur="4.44">eventually what they can do is get rid</text>
  <text start="896.62" dur="3.66">of cash because that&amp;#39;s what they really</text>
  <text start="898.15" dur="4.2">want to do and bring us into a complete</text>
  <text start="900.28" dur="5.61">digital system that they can control</text>
  <text start="902.35" dur="7.59">this is their goal this is what they</text>
  <text start="905.89" dur="6.75">want to do this is their plan it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="909.94" dur="4.59">mean it&amp;#39;s going to work if the people</text>
  <text start="912.64" dur="4.68">around the world say no we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="914.53" dur="4.47">this we object to this and we go to our</text>
  <text start="917.32" dur="4.35">government and hopefully the government</text>
  <text start="919" dur="3.99">people listen and say yeah the people</text>
  <text start="921.67" dur="3.51">don&amp;#39;t want this at all they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="922.99" dur="3.66">the central bank to handle this but</text>
  <text start="925.18" dur="3.84">again the central bank is going to make</text>
  <text start="926.65" dur="5.07">it look like the crypto market which is</text>
  <text start="929.02" dur="5.19">Bitcoin is so bad that they need to</text>
  <text start="931.72" dur="4.74">control it just like the Euro just like</text>
  <text start="934.21" dur="4.77">the dollar just like everything else</text>
  <text start="936.46" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s out there so we can see right now</text>
  <text start="938.98" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;re gonna be going through this</text>
  <text start="940.36" dur="4.26">transition we&amp;#39;re going to be moving to a</text>
  <text start="942.61" dur="4.23">different currency there&amp;#39;s gonna be a</text>
  <text start="944.62" dur="5.01">high level currency it&amp;#39;s gonna be backed</text>
  <text start="946.84" dur="5.55">by gold and yes all of this is gonna</text>
  <text start="949.63" dur="4.59">come into play and this is why you need</text>
  <text start="952.39" dur="4.08">to be prepared you need to have some</text>
  <text start="954.22" dur="4.38">type of cryptocurrency you need to have</text>
  <text start="956.47" dur="3.51">gold and silver gold and silver is</text>
  <text start="958.6" dur="3.36">really going to protect your wealth the</text>
  <text start="959.98" dur="4.23">cryptocurrency you&amp;#39;ll be able to you</text>
  <text start="961.96" dur="3.99">know take that move it into whatever</text>
  <text start="964.21" dur="3.39">system they&amp;#39;re going to come online or</text>
  <text start="965.95" dur="4.35">if the people have a system you&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="967.6" dur="4.68">able to move that to that system the</text>
  <text start="970.3" dur="3.6">gold and silver is just gonna go up in</text>
  <text start="972.28" dur="4.53">price because as the dollar completely</text>
  <text start="973.9" dur="4.56">disappears and everything is reset gold</text>
  <text start="976.81" dur="4.05">is gonna skyrocket this is why Russia</text>
  <text start="978.46" dur="3.78">and China have been purchasing gold this</text>
  <text start="980.86" dur="3">is why India and the rest of the</text>
  <text start="982.24" dur="4.35">countries this is why they&amp;#39;re coming up</text>
  <text start="983.86" dur="4.29">with the gold trading system so we have</text>
  <text start="986.59" dur="3.21">different levels now</text>
  <text start="988.15" dur="3.09">that they&amp;#39;re thinking about which</text>
  <text start="989.8" dur="3.06">actually they&amp;#39;re not even thinking about</text>
  <text start="991.24" dur="3.6">it now they&amp;#39;ve been pushing this for</text>
  <text start="992.86" dur="3.36">quite a while and it looks like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="994.84" dur="2.7">coming to the point where they&amp;#39;re ready</text>
  <text start="996.22" dur="3.69">to go live with it</text>
  <text start="997.54" dur="5.85">because as we can see the propaganda is</text>
  <text start="999.91" dur="5.91">building about Bitcoin how the Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="1003.39" dur="4.71">is in a bubble how Bitcoin is volatile</text>
  <text start="1005.82" dur="4.83">how it&amp;#39;s not safe and they want people</text>
  <text start="1008.1" dur="5.67">all in just like the stock market just</text>
  <text start="1010.65" dur="5.58">like everything else and once they do</text>
  <text start="1013.77" dur="4.95">this they can convince people this is</text>
  <text start="1016.23" dur="3.6">why we need to control it this is why we</text>
  <text start="1018.72" dur="2.94">need more laws think about when</text>
  <text start="1019.83" dur="3.09">everything happens in the stock market</text>
  <text start="1021.66" dur="3.84">or the housing market a student loan</text>

  <text start="1025.5" dur="4.58">things go south what do they come up</text>
  <text start="1027.39" dur="5.37">with more laws more laws to control</text>
  <text start="1030.08" dur="4.12">everything and this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
