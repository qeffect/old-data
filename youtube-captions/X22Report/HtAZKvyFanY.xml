  <text start="106.06" dur="4.05">while and we understand that the job</text>
  <text start="107.71" dur="4.23">numbers are completely manipulated and</text>
  <text start="110.11" dur="3.27">the manipulation has not stopped</text>

  <text start="113.38" dur="5.25">office everything is still being</text>
  <text start="115.84" dur="5.61">manipulated and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="118.63" dur="5.31">now is this manipulation is continually</text>
  <text start="121.45" dur="3.93">being pushed forward where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="123.94" dur="3.36">telling us that the economy is great I</text>
  <text start="125.38" dur="3.989">mean the GDP numbers are manipulated</text>
  <text start="127.3" dur="3.659">stock markets manipulated the</text>
  <text start="129.369" dur="3.271">unemployment numbers are manipulated and</text>
  <text start="130.959" dur="4.621">they continually do this now the job</text>
  <text start="132.64" dur="6.23">numbers came out today and the job</text>
  <text start="135.58" dur="7.409">numbers warned as good as everyone</text>
  <text start="138.87" dur="6.15">expected because they thought the job</text>
  <text start="142.989" dur="4.801">numbers are going to be over 200,000 the</text>
  <text start="145.02" dur="4.45">BLS reported that the December numbers</text>
  <text start="147.79" dur="5.19">came in around a hundred and forty eight</text>
  <text start="149.47" dur="5.37">thousand and this is much lower than</text>
  <text start="152.98" dur="3.63">they expected now of course these</text>
  <text start="154.84" dur="3.39">numbers are going to be revised just</text>
  <text start="156.61" dur="4.53">like they always do they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="158.23" dur="5.16">revising numbers since the beginning</text>
  <text start="161.14" dur="5.04">they make the lower numbers higher than</text>
  <text start="163.39" dur="5.069">they bring the numbers up again to make</text>
  <text start="166.18" dur="4.23">everything look fantastic but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="168.459" dur="4.381">seeing right now is a complete breakdown</text>
  <text start="170.41" dur="4.26">of what is really happening out there</text>
  <text start="172.84" dur="3.39">and when we look at the job numbers we</text>
  <text start="174.67" dur="3.899">can see that they are manipulated now</text>
  <text start="176.23" dur="4.17">there are two different unemployment</text>
  <text start="178.569" dur="3.151">rates the u 3 u 6 actually there&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="180.4" dur="3.6">than that but these are the two that</text>
  <text start="181.72" dur="4.09">they follow the corporate media usually</text>
  <text start="184" dur="3.52">reports on the u3</text>
  <text start="185.81" dur="5.16">then we have the u6 now they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="187.52" dur="5.4">very different the unemployment rate for</text>
  <text start="190.97" dur="5.91">the u3 came in a four point one percent</text>
  <text start="192.92" dur="5.16">the u6 unemployment rose to eight point</text>
  <text start="196.88" dur="2.609">one percent and if you go to John</text>
  <text start="198.08" dur="3.15">Williams he&amp;#39;s saying that the</text>
  <text start="199.489" dur="4.351">unemployment rate is around 20 something</text>
  <text start="201.23" dur="4.95">percent and we see right now in he&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="203.84" dur="5.759">he&amp;#39;s using a calculation that goes back</text>
  <text start="206.18" dur="5.279">before the the 1990s around that time</text>
  <text start="209.599" dur="4.321">period and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="211.459" dur="4.771">is that there&amp;#39;s a lot of individuals</text>
  <text start="213.92" dur="4.5">that are out of work because the labor</text>
  <text start="216.23" dur="4.68">force participation rate is around sixty</text>
  <text start="218.42" dur="4.5">sixty two point seven percent which</text>
  <text start="220.91" dur="5.12">means the rest of the country they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="222.92" dur="5.61">just completely unemployed and the 62.7%</text>
  <text start="226.03" dur="5.019">brings us back to the nineteen eighty</text>
  <text start="228.53" dur="7.739">levels now we need to understand that in</text>
  <text start="231.049" dur="8.52">the 90s in the 2000s even 2008 we were</text>
  <text start="236.269" dur="5.97">anywhere from 66 all the way up to sixty</text>
  <text start="239.569" dur="4.711">seven point five percent and we have to</text>
  <text start="242.239" dur="4.801">remember the population keeps growing</text>
  <text start="244.28" dur="4.89">and the populations getting larger and</text>
  <text start="247.04" dur="4.59">larger and the number of people working</text>
  <text start="249.17" dur="3.75">is getting smaller and smaller and you</text>
  <text start="251.63" dur="3.63">have to remember how they calculate all</text>
  <text start="252.92" dur="4.68">this those people who still want a job</text>
  <text start="255.26" dur="4.14">still you know sending out their resume</text>
  <text start="257.6" dur="3.389">who haven&amp;#39;t been on an interview within</text>
  <text start="259.4" dur="4.17">four weeks they don&amp;#39;t count them anymore</text>
  <text start="260.989" dur="4.501">those people who&amp;#39;s just given up because</text>
  <text start="263.57" dur="3.12">they just can&amp;#39;t find anything they just</text>
  <text start="265.49" dur="3.63">don&amp;#39;t count them anymore</text>
  <text start="266.69" dur="4.47">and those people who you know are</text>
  <text start="269.12" dur="4.14">working one two three port time jobs</text>
  <text start="271.16" dur="3.78">those are counted as one two three full</text>
  <text start="273.26" dur="3.06">time jobs and when they lose those</text>
  <text start="274.94" dur="3.42">part-time jobs depending on how many</text>
  <text start="276.32" dur="3.93">hours they&amp;#39;re working and depends how</text>
  <text start="278.36" dur="5.19">much they&amp;#39;re getting paid it all depends</text>
  <text start="280.25" dur="5.94">per state they might not be included in</text>
  <text start="283.55" dur="4.679">the job loss of a full-time job because</text>
  <text start="286.19" dur="4.05">they might not meet the requirements and</text>
  <text start="288.229" dur="3.75">it might be considered a part-time loss</text>
  <text start="290.24" dur="4.08">and they just don&amp;#39;t count it but they</text>
  <text start="291.979" dur="3.901">were counted as a full-time job so we</text>
  <text start="294.32" dur="4.53">can see how all of this is completely</text>
  <text start="295.88" dur="5.789">manipulated now the average the average</text>
  <text start="298.85" dur="5.7">hourly earnings has really gone nowhere</text>
  <text start="301.669" dur="5.581">I mean since 2008 where it dropped</text>
  <text start="304.55" dur="6.69">dramatically it&amp;#39;s been bobbing up and</text>
  <text start="307.25" dur="7.01">down below anything recognizable where</text>
  <text start="311.24" dur="4.919">wages are growing and right now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="314.26" dur="5.26">basically going on where it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="316.159" dur="6.66">flatlined if you really look at this so</text>
  <text start="319.52" dur="6.269">nothing has improved whatsoever so where</text>
  <text start="322.819" dur="6.06">did we lose all the jobs what happened</text>
  <text start="325.789" dur="6.571">where why all of a sudden did the jobs</text>
  <text start="328.879" dur="6.181">decline so rapidly in December when when</text>
  <text start="332.36" dur="4.559">you look at this it came from the retail</text>
  <text start="335.06" dur="4.71">industry now which is very odd because</text>
  <text start="336.919" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;re in the holiday season remember all</text>
  <text start="339.77" dur="4.709">those stores that were closing and the</text>
  <text start="342.259" dur="3.9">jobs that were being lost at Macy&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="344.479" dur="2.851">report they&amp;#39;re gonna be laying on 5,000</text>
  <text start="346.159" dur="4.561">people because they&amp;#39;re closing stores</text>
  <text start="347.33" dur="5.75">well guess what all those numbers</text>
  <text start="350.72" dur="6.39">started to come in and it looks like</text>
  <text start="353.08" dur="6.76">retail jobs tumbled by 20,000 now</text>
  <text start="357.11" dur="4.739">remember when stores closed they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="359.84" dur="4.049">count those numbers right off the bat</text>
  <text start="361.849" dur="4.38">same thing with sales they average it</text>
  <text start="363.889" dur="4.471">out and they wait for a period of time</text>
  <text start="366.229" dur="3.541">and then they include it and it looks</text>
  <text start="368.36" dur="3.799">like this is what they&amp;#39;ve been doing and</text>
  <text start="369.77" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;re at this point where retail is</text>
  <text start="372.159" dur="4.781">starting to decline we&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="374.33" dur="4.29">seeing it now compared to what they were</text>
  <text start="376.94" dur="3.36">saying before where they&amp;#39;re saying Oh</text>
  <text start="378.62" dur="3.69">everyone&amp;#39;s getting employed in retail</text>
  <text start="380.3" dur="3.45">it&amp;#39;s just the way you manipulate the</text>
  <text start="382.31" dur="4.079">numbers you can make it look any way you</text>
  <text start="383.75" dur="5.58">want but in reality people are losing</text>
  <text start="386.389" dur="4.741">their jobs what they do is they</text>
  <text start="389.33" dur="4.5">manipulate it to make it seem like</text>
  <text start="391.13" dur="5.399">retail is still strong and still doing</text>
  <text start="393.83" dur="5.13">well but credit Swiss is out there and</text>
  <text start="396.529" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re saying that the retail industry</text>
  <text start="398.96" dur="5.19">well we&amp;#39;re gonna have major major</text>
  <text start="401.449" dur="4.741">problems in 2018 we&amp;#39;re gonna see a wave</text>
  <text start="404.15" dur="4.919">of store closings and retailer</text>
  <text start="406.19" dur="4.259">bankruptcies in this year they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="409.069" dur="3.181">looking at it and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="410.449" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s deteriorating very very quickly</text>
  <text start="412.25" dur="5.159">Macy&amp;#39;s has already said that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="414.349" dur="4.68">closing stores JC Penney&amp;#39;s is looking</text>
  <text start="417.409" dur="4.051">that they might be closing some stores</text>
  <text start="419.029" dur="3.931">we&amp;#39;re seeing other stores that are going</text>
  <text start="421.46" dur="3.299">to be reporting in saying that we have</text>
  <text start="422.96" dur="3.72">to close Sears is one of them and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="424.759" dur="3.871">gonna see many other retailers coming</text>
  <text start="426.68" dur="3.209">out saying that yes sales weren&amp;#39;t as</text>
  <text start="428.63" dur="2.399">great now of course the corporate media</text>
  <text start="429.889" dur="3.571">is out there saying that ooh</text>
  <text start="431.029" dur="4.32">retailers are saying that sales were a</text>
  <text start="433.46" dur="5.16">lot better than they thought but again</text>
  <text start="435.349" dur="5.94">what was their profit I mean they could</text>
  <text start="438.62" dur="6.21">have sales yes but if they had a lower</text>
  <text start="441.289" dur="5.521">the prices on their products so far down</text>
  <text start="444.83" dur="3.959">where they didn&amp;#39;t make a profit and they</text>
  <text start="446.81" dur="4.56">they can&amp;#39;t bring in the revenue to</text>
  <text start="448.789" dur="4.171">support their stores guess what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="451.37" dur="4.65">going to be closing them we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="452.96" dur="5.22">this before and we&amp;#39;re gonna see it again</text>
  <text start="456.02" dur="4.019">and this is what we&amp;#39;re waiting for now</text>
  <text start="458.18" dur="4.44">is this gonna spread to every single</text>
  <text start="460.039" dur="4.081">store all at once no just like the real</text>
  <text start="462.62" dur="3.66">estate market when it started to</text>
  <text start="464.12" dur="4.65">collapse people saw it on TV in</text>
  <text start="466.28" dur="4.35">California people saw some places in the</text>
  <text start="468.77" dur="3.929">East Coast the South was really good</text>
  <text start="470.63" dur="3.599">people were still speculating down there</text>
  <text start="472.699" dur="3.241">no one even knew what was going on and</text>
  <text start="474.229" dur="4.021">all of a sudden it started to spread</text>
  <text start="475.94" dur="5.22">those people in certain areas of the</text>
  <text start="478.25" dur="7.199">country you might be seeing that your</text>
  <text start="481.16" dur="6.81">town your city is still doing well it</text>
  <text start="485.449" dur="6.301">just takes a certain amount of time to</text>
  <text start="487.97" dur="5.729">reach your area and it does spread and</text>
  <text start="491.75" dur="4.11">what we see is it spreads in certain</text>
  <text start="493.699" dur="4.621">areas first and then it spreads you know</text>
  <text start="495.86" dur="5.19">more so to the outer reaches and it gets</text>
  <text start="498.32" dur="4.5">to more cities more towns and then</text>
  <text start="501.05" dur="3.42">before you know it people are sitting</text>
  <text start="502.82" dur="2.969">there going what is going on here</text>
  <text start="504.47" dur="6.539">I don&amp;#39;t understand I mean I remember</text>
  <text start="505.789" dur="8.041">back in 2006 2007 when the Northeast all</text>
  <text start="511.009" dur="4.53">of a sudden for housing traffic dried up</text>
  <text start="513.83" dur="3.93">people couldn&amp;#39;t understand that the</text>
  <text start="515.539" dur="4.081">Realtors didn&amp;#39;t understand it but in the</text>
  <text start="517.76" dur="4.17">South you spoke to someone in Miami or</text>
  <text start="519.62" dur="3.51">something they say no real estate is</text>
  <text start="521.93" dur="3.87">fantastic here what building like crazy</text>
  <text start="523.13" dur="4.86">I have more contracts than I can count</text>
  <text start="525.8" dur="3.9">and the people up in the Northeast going</text>
  <text start="527.99" dur="3.27">I don&amp;#39;t understand this what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="529.7" dur="4.35">here and then eventually what happened</text>
  <text start="531.26" dur="4.889">it&amp;#39;s spread and it&amp;#39;s spread all the way</text>
  <text start="534.05" dur="5.4">down to the south it spread to the</text>
  <text start="536.149" dur="4.591">Midwest it spread everywhere and people</text>
  <text start="539.45" dur="2.85">were all sitting there scratching their</text>
  <text start="540.74" dur="2.19">heads going I don&amp;#39;t understand what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="542.3" dur="3.479">going on</text>
  <text start="542.93" dur="5.37">why is traffic drawing up we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="545.779" dur="5.131">see the same thing once again we see the</text>
  <text start="548.3" dur="6.779">is M services printed a disappointing</text>
  <text start="550.91" dur="6.929">55.9 they were expecting a 57.6 it</text>
  <text start="555.079" dur="4.801">dropped to a four-month low and new</text>
  <text start="557.839" dur="4.231">orders have utterly collapsed in the</text>
  <text start="559.88" dur="5.55">last two months even after the</text>
  <text start="562.07" dur="4.98">hurricanes and business activity fell so</text>
  <text start="565.43" dur="3.39">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is things are starting</text>
  <text start="567.05" dur="3.84">to fall apart we are getting tons of</text>
  <text start="568.82" dur="5.55">indicators letting us know like the</text>
  <text start="570.89" dur="5.189">yield curve and the Bank of America 11</text>
  <text start="574.37" dur="3.42">indicators out of 19 telling us that</text>
  <text start="576.079" dur="4.021">we&amp;#39;re heading into a recession we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="577.79" dur="4.83">looked at other indicators especially</text>
  <text start="580.1" dur="4.41">with the Fed who actually discontinued</text>
  <text start="582.62" dur="4.05">some of their indicators so you wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="584.51" dur="3.54">find out what was really going on</text>
  <text start="586.67" dur="3.09">one of their indicators was very good</text>
  <text start="588.05" dur="4.01">that told us that we are in a recession</text>
  <text start="589.76" dur="5.04">right now and they discontinued it and</text>
  <text start="592.06" dur="5.17">this tells you that they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="594.8" dur="4.89">cover up everything so you don&amp;#39;t really</text>

  <text start="778.46" dur="7.74">same thing is happening once again don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="782.15" dur="6.6">be fooled by it because behind the</text>
  <text start="786.2" dur="4.56">curtain is what is really happening and</text>
  <text start="788.75" dur="3.66">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s we that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="790.76" dur="4.11">looking at we&amp;#39;re not looking at the</text>
  <text start="792.41" dur="4.74">shiny new thing in front of us we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="794.87" dur="5.1">looking beyond that to see what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="797.15" dur="5.07">going on behind the curtain and what we</text>
  <text start="799.97" dur="5.06">see behind the curtain are warning signs</text>
  <text start="802.22" dur="6.15">all over the place</text>
  <text start="805.03" dur="5.98">we see in Venezuela and this is a really</text>
  <text start="808.37" dur="5.42">good example where they&amp;#39;re seeing a huge</text>
  <text start="811.01" dur="5.46">amount of inflation the boulevard is</text>
  <text start="813.79" dur="6.04">declining rapidly the paper currency is</text>
  <text start="816.47" dur="4.92">worth nothing and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="819.83" dur="3.39">Venezuelan government has nearly</text>
  <text start="821.39" dur="4.98">exhausted its foreign exchange reserves</text>
  <text start="823.22" dur="6.42">and its citizens have resorted to mining</text>
  <text start="826.37" dur="7.38">Bitcoin trying to get some wealth and</text>
  <text start="829.64" dur="6.39">the country&amp;#39;s economic crisis is finally</text>
  <text start="833.75" dur="4.23">forcing the government to make unusual</text>
  <text start="836.03" dur="4.71">requests of its trading partners</text>
  <text start="837.98" dur="4.74">including pharmaceutical companies from</text>
  <text start="840.74" dur="4.92">which the government buys medicine for</text>
  <text start="842.72" dur="4.32">the country&amp;#39;s hospitals and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="845.66" dur="3.24">trying to do right now instead of using</text>
  <text start="847.04" dur="6.94">their currency they&amp;#39;re saying would you</text>
  <text start="848.9" dur="9.79">accept diamonds gold or other precious</text>
  <text start="853.98" dur="7.26">you mean the gold silver diamonds the</text>
  <text start="858.69" dur="3.87">things that really hold value I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="861.24" dur="3.38">say so much diamonds I would say more</text>
  <text start="862.56" dur="5.7">golden and silver and other precious</text>
  <text start="864.62" dur="6.88">metals but they&amp;#39;re looking at something</text>
  <text start="868.26" dur="5.97">that has real value to give to the</text>
  <text start="871.5" dur="5.76">pharmaceuticals to get the medicines now</text>
  <text start="874.23" dur="4.86">the farmer representatives they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="877.26" dur="3.12">know what to do with this because</text>
  <text start="879.09" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re saying well we normally don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="880.38" dur="5.73">take you know gold silver diamonds and</text>
  <text start="882.99" dur="4.44">things like that we like cash but</text>
  <text start="886.11" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re looking at this saying you know</text>
  <text start="887.43" dur="6.93">something maybe we should accept gold</text>
  <text start="890.88" dur="5.61">maybe we should accept diamonds because</text>
  <text start="894.36" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re looking at how much it&amp;#39;s worth</text>
  <text start="896.49" dur="5.34">what they can sell it for</text>
  <text start="898.38" dur="6.42">and there&amp;#39;s thinking maybe this is a</text>
  <text start="901.83" dur="5.31">good idea maybe we will do this they</text>
  <text start="904.8" dur="5.34">haven&amp;#39;t decided as of yet but you can</text>
  <text start="907.14" dur="7.08">see and the point being made here is</text>
  <text start="910.14" dur="7.62">that when things go south and your paper</text>
  <text start="914.22" dur="8.16">currency is absolutely worthless you</text>
  <text start="917.76" dur="6.69">turn to something that holds value yes</text>
  <text start="922.38" dur="4.98">there are people in there trying to mine</text>
  <text start="924.45" dur="6.87">bitcoins but to make a large purchase</text>
  <text start="927.36" dur="6.87">they&amp;#39;re using precious metals to make</text>
  <text start="931.32" dur="5.67">this purchase because they understand</text>
  <text start="934.23" dur="4.05">gold holds value actually if you notice</text>
  <text start="936.99" dur="3.36">gold has been moving up a little bit and</text>
  <text start="938.28" dur="4.41">like I said in the past once you see</text>
  <text start="940.35" dur="4.62">just like Bitcoin once you see gold</text>
  <text start="942.69" dur="4.77">start to move up fourteen hundred</text>
  <text start="944.97" dur="4.92">seventeen hundred nineteen hundred two</text>
  <text start="947.46" dur="4.95">thousand well you know there is</text>
  <text start="949.89" dur="5.49">definitely something wrong in the</text>
  <text start="952.41" dur="4.86">economy because once they the gold</text>
  <text start="955.38" dur="3.33">starts to move up like this you know the</text>
  <text start="957.27" dur="3.33">central bank has lost complete control</text>
  <text start="958.71" dur="4.17">because they can&amp;#39;t manipulate it down</text>
  <text start="960.6" dur="4.86">anymore and once you see gold move like</text>
  <text start="962.88" dur="5.19">this it&amp;#39;s gonna be very very difficult</text>
  <text start="965.46" dur="4.23">to get same thing with silver and when</text>
  <text start="968.07" dur="4.2">it starts moving up even faster than</text>
  <text start="969.69" dur="4.68">that that&amp;#39;s the signal now are we</text>
  <text start="972.27" dur="3.93">exactly there yet no but we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="974.37" dur="3.54">to see gold move up a little bit will</text>
  <text start="976.2" dur="4.5">the central bank&amp;#39;s smash it down once</text>
  <text start="977.91" dur="6.68">again they might but we can see that</text>
  <text start="980.7" dur="6.93">during a crisis during a currency crisis</text>
  <text start="984.59" dur="6.64">countries the people they will</text>
  <text start="987.63" dur="6.03">turn to other ways of paying for things</text>
  <text start="991.23" dur="3.66">and there are economist out in Venezuela</text>
  <text start="993.66" dur="4.41">saying that inflation is going to</text>
  <text start="994.89" dur="5.49">surpass 2000 percent during the coming</text>
  <text start="998.07" dur="4.2">year which tells you something they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1000.38" dur="3.72">also calling for inflation here in the</text>
  <text start="1002.27" dur="3.18">United States throughout Europe even</text>
  <text start="1004.1" dur="3.6">though the Fed is out there saying that</text>
  <text start="1005.45" dur="3.48">inflation is still very low you can see</text>
  <text start="1007.7" dur="2.58">inflation in many different areas</text>
  <text start="1008.93" dur="3.03">remember they&amp;#39;ve been offloading it in</text>
  <text start="1010.28" dur="4.86">many different places the stock market</text>
  <text start="1011.96" dur="6.33">the housing market the college tuitions</text>
  <text start="1015.14" dur="4.41">out to other countries and eventually</text>
  <text start="1018.29" dur="2.46">what&amp;#39;s going to happen it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1019.55" dur="4.08">come all back to United States</text>
  <text start="1020.75" dur="4.35">especially when other countries decide</text>
  <text start="1023.63" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re not going to be using the dollar</text>
  <text start="1025.1" dur="3.81">as their reserve currency to purchase</text>
  <text start="1026.9" dur="3.48">oil because what do they do them with</text>
  <text start="1028.91" dur="2.789">those dollars well they&amp;#39;re gonna float</text>
  <text start="1030.38" dur="4.02">back to United States which means more</text>
  <text start="1031.699" dur="6.231">currency in circulation which means it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1034.4" dur="5.58">a declining the currency is devalued</text>
  <text start="1037.93" dur="3.88">because there&amp;#39;s a lot more currency in</text>
  <text start="1039.98" dur="3.719">circulation which means it costs a lot</text>
  <text start="1041.81" dur="4.139">more dollars to pay for those items</text>
  <text start="1043.699" dur="3.691">which is inflation the items don&amp;#39;t go up</text>
  <text start="1045.949" dur="3.691">in price the value of the dollar</text>
  <text start="1047.39" dur="4.74">declines you need a lot more of them to</text>
  <text start="1049.64" dur="4.53">get the same exact thing same thing with</text>
  <text start="1052.13" dur="3.3">gold you can need a lot more dollars to</text>
  <text start="1054.17" dur="4.62">get the gold that&amp;#39;s why you see gold</text>
  <text start="1055.43" dur="5.34">move up in price and we&amp;#39;re heading to</text>
  <text start="1058.79" dur="4.92">that period of time and we can see that</text>
  <text start="1060.77" dur="5.67">other countries that&amp;#39;s an example of</text>
  <text start="1063.71" dur="5.16">what you can expect when things start to</text>
  <text start="1066.44" dur="5.37">fall apart and your paper currency loses</text>
  <text start="1068.87" dur="5.37">its value completely people turn to</text>
  <text start="1071.81" dur="4.11">bartering people turn to precious metals</text>
  <text start="1074.24" dur="5.19">they might even turn to the</text>
  <text start="1075.92" dur="5.61">cryptocurrency market to sell that to</text>
  <text start="1079.43" dur="4.53">purchase you know something may be a</text>
  <text start="1081.53" dur="4.83">piece of gold and then use the gold to</text>
  <text start="1083.96" dur="4.14">purchase their items or maybe if they</text>
  <text start="1086.36" dur="3.75">can use the cryptocurrency to purchase</text>
  <text start="1088.1" dur="3.96">that item they might do that but you can</text>
  <text start="1090.11" dur="3.57">see we&amp;#39;re headed in that same exact</text>
  <text start="1092.06" dur="4.2">direction this is why you need to be</text>
