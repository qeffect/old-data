  <text start="52.199" dur="8.96">to head out to Europe the eurozone and</text>
  <text start="56.75" dur="6.85">they&amp;#39;re continually convincing us that</text>
  <text start="61.159" dur="4.901">they have everything under control out</text>
  <text start="63.6" dur="5.67">there but there was a reach in a recent</text>
  <text start="66.06" dur="5.66">survey which was conducted and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="69.27" dur="7.86">showing that the 19 country eurozone is</text>
  <text start="71.72" dur="8.34">now showing signs of slowing I I have to</text>
  <text start="77.13" dur="5.849">object to that I&amp;#39;m going to say that</text>
  <text start="80.06" dur="5.13">this whole thing has been collapsing and</text>
  <text start="82.979" dur="5.631">it&amp;#39;s not just beginning to show signs</text>
  <text start="85.19" dur="6.129">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing the signs all along</text>
  <text start="88.61" dur="5.17">market said Wednesday its monthly</text>
  <text start="91.319" dur="5.461">purchasing manager indexed a broad gauge</text>

  <text start="96.78" dur="5.339">point nine points in September from 54.3</text>
  <text start="99.479" dur="5.541">the previous month some economists are</text>
  <text start="102.119" dur="6.18">beginning to worry about the impact of</text>
  <text start="105.02" dur="4.36">German growth at this point and of</text>
  <text start="108.299" dur="3.42">course now the blaming this on the</text>
  <text start="109.38" dur="5.669">Volkswagen crisis where they kind of</text>
  <text start="111.719" dur="5.93">pre-programmed their software to make it</text>
  <text start="115.049" dur="5.67">look like their cars weren&amp;#39;t spewing out</text>
  <text start="117.649" dur="4.211">deadly emissions into the atmosphere to</text>
  <text start="120.719" dur="4.741">make it look better than it really was</text>
  <text start="121.86" dur="5.67">and then they use the copyright laws to</text>
  <text start="125.46" dur="4.29">protect anyone from looking at their</text>
  <text start="127.53" dur="5.519">software and of course they&amp;#39;re caught</text>
  <text start="129.75" dur="4.709">and they said oh you know there&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="133.049" dur="4.291">about four hundred and eighty two</text>
  <text start="134.459" dur="6.06">thousand cars that we have this problem</text>
  <text start="137.34" dur="7.47">with but it turns out it&amp;#39;s about 11</text>
  <text start="140.519" dur="7.951">million diesel vehicles right now and we</text>
  <text start="144.81" dur="6.12">can see at this point the company and a</text>
  <text start="148.47" dur="7.769">lot of corporations do this they do</text>
  <text start="150.93" dur="7.32">things in a way to get their sales up</text>
  <text start="156.239" dur="4.351">and they knew this was going to be a</text>
  <text start="158.25" dur="4.889">major problem we see GM does it with the</text>
  <text start="160.59" dur="3.33">ignition switch they just push things</text>
  <text start="163.139" dur="2.101">out there</text>
  <text start="163.92" dur="3.48">they don&amp;#39;t care if it&amp;#39;s a failure</text>
  <text start="165.24" dur="3.54">hopefully nobody notices and eventually</text>
  <text start="167.4" dur="4.94">people do notice but they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="168.78" dur="6.81">blame all this on Volkswagen right now</text>
  <text start="172.34" dur="7">this was coming for a long time this has</text>
  <text start="175.59" dur="6.24">nothing to do with one company I mean</text>
  <text start="179.34" dur="5.27">will it be a Black Swan that will bring</text>
  <text start="181.83" dur="5.37">the entire system down most likely not</text>
  <text start="184.61" dur="4.72">but they always like to point at one</text>
  <text start="187.2" dur="4.41">thing that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the problem this is</text>
  <text start="189.33" dur="7.35">why we&amp;#39;re having the problem but as</text>
  <text start="191.61" dur="8.01">we&amp;#39;ve shown this isn&amp;#39;t the problem the</text>
  <text start="196.68" dur="6.089">problem has been brewing since I would</text>
  <text start="199.62" dur="4.83">say 1913 but right now we&amp;#39;ll just go</text>
  <text start="202.769" dur="4.681">back to two thousand eight when they</text>
  <text start="204.45" dur="5.369">tried to fix everything with creating</text>
  <text start="207.45" dur="4.92">money and not really helping the</text>
  <text start="209.819" dur="4.081">everyday person or the economy they just</text>
  <text start="212.37" dur="5.13">decided to help the central bank the</text>
  <text start="213.9" dur="7.44">elite the corporate powers and all they</text>
  <text start="217.5" dur="5.43">did was make it worse I mean here in the</text>
  <text start="221.34" dur="3.27">United States are continually saying</text>
  <text start="222.93" dur="3.99">that you know we&amp;#39;re going to have this</text>
  <text start="224.61" dur="3.54">incredible retail season coming up this</text>
  <text start="226.92" dur="3.84">holiday season because the unemployment</text>
  <text start="228.15" dur="6.24">is down in 5.1 percent and common sense</text>
  <text start="230.76" dur="5.13">would would say you know yes this would</text>
  <text start="234.39" dur="3.03">all make sense if the unemployment</text>
  <text start="235.89" dur="3.75">continually comes down more people are</text>
  <text start="237.42" dur="3.9">working they&amp;#39;re making money and now the</text>
  <text start="239.64" dur="3.12">retail sales should be going up but in</text>
  <text start="241.32" dur="2.759">the past we haven&amp;#39;t been seeing this</text>
  <text start="242.76" dur="4.34">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing the retail sales</text>
  <text start="244.079" dur="4.831">continually sliding as time goes on</text>
  <text start="247.1" dur="4.57">because you have to remember back in</text>
  <text start="248.91" dur="4.77">2008 going forward to 2009 10-11</text>
  <text start="251.67" dur="4.08">unemployment was much much higher and</text>
  <text start="253.68" dur="6.029">sales were higher and as unemployment</text>
  <text start="255.75" dur="8.61">came down sales came down which makes no</text>
  <text start="259.709" dur="9.151">sense but this point right now for this</text>
  <text start="264.36" dur="9.6">time of the year sales growth is as weak</text>
  <text start="268.86" dur="9.45">as it was in 2009 when we first entered</text>
  <text start="273.96" dur="8.99">the Great Recession there&amp;#39;s about point</text>
  <text start="278.31" dur="4.64">nine percent year-over-year growth and</text>
  <text start="283.28" dur="6.639">Reuter reports this is the weakest us</text>
  <text start="286.889" dur="7.231">holiday sale season for retailers since</text>
  <text start="289.919" dur="6.781">the recession how could that be wet</text>
  <text start="294.12" dur="3.48">unemployment of 5.1 real estate&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="296.7" dur="3.69">improving it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="297.6" dur="5.87">recovery retail&amp;#39;s doing fine GDP way up</text>
  <text start="300.39" dur="5.97">there something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="303.47" dur="5.8">consultancy firm AlixPartners expect</text>
  <text start="306.36" dur="4.86">sales growth to be about 2.8 23.4</text>
  <text start="309.27" dur="6.09">percent during the November December</text>
  <text start="311.22" dur="7.83">shopping period compared with 4.4% in</text>
  <text start="315.36" dur="7.23">2014 but based on analyzing consumer</text>
  <text start="319.05" dur="7.56">spending trends so far this year guess</text>
  <text start="322.59" dur="7.11">what it&amp;#39;s not even going to hit that</text>
  <text start="326.61" dur="4.98">market not anywhere close actually it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="329.7" dur="6.75">most likely going to be a complete</text>
  <text start="331.59" dur="8.7">disaster and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="336.45" dur="7.11">it is a complete disaster I mean if we</text>
  <text start="340.29" dur="10.53">look back in time to the previous years</text>
  <text start="343.56" dur="12.33">we see sales in the year of 2010 around</text>
  <text start="350.82" dur="8.15">four point three percent 2011 we see it</text>
  <text start="355.89" dur="9.09">very close to four point nine percent</text>
  <text start="358.97" dur="11.17">2012 we see it very close to three</text>
  <text start="364.98" dur="10.35">percent 2013 we see it at around four</text>
  <text start="370.14" dur="9.63">and a half percent 2014 was at five</text>
  <text start="375.33" dur="7.44">point four percent this was during the</text>
  <text start="379.77" dur="5.61">September period we&amp;#39;re at point nine</text>
  <text start="382.77" dur="7.77">percent right now what does that tell</text>
  <text start="385.38" dur="7.89">you that tells you this year is not</text>
  <text start="390.54" dur="9.27">going to be good whatsoever it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="393.27" dur="9.78">to be absolutely horrific now even the</text>
  <text start="399.81" dur="7.52">manufacturing is showing us things are</text>
  <text start="403.05" dur="9.65">not going well US manufacturing PMI</text>
  <text start="407.33" dur="8.83">printed a September preliminary 53.0 and</text>
  <text start="412.7" dur="5.38">of course this is completely flatlined</text>
  <text start="416.16" dur="6.89">and we&amp;#39;re seeing other manufacturing</text>
  <text start="418.08" dur="7.17">data where it has declined dramatically</text>
  <text start="423.05" dur="4.3">factory prices dropped for the first</text>
  <text start="425.25" dur="5.54">time in three years new orders and</text>
  <text start="427.35" dur="3.44">employment slowed</text>
  <text start="431.1" dur="6.33">all of this right now is pointing to a</text>
  <text start="434.01" dur="5.46">complete collapse of the system the ball</text>
  <text start="437.43" dur="5.49">turret the Baltic Dry Index which is the</text>
  <text start="439.47" dur="5.94">raw material which is used to create</text>
  <text start="442.92" dur="5.67">products they&amp;#39;re delivered to</text>
  <text start="445.41" dur="5.28">manufacturers and we&amp;#39;re seeing this</text>
  <text start="448.59" dur="4.98">holding steady about 9 17 right now</text>
  <text start="450.69" dur="5.88">usually it&amp;#39;s around 1200 at this point</text>
  <text start="453.57" dur="6.15">and it&amp;#39;s been fluctuating up and down</text>
  <text start="456.57" dur="6.75">and right now today it is turned down</text>
  <text start="459.72" dur="7.67">once again and we know that real estate</text>
  <text start="463.32" dur="7.83">is not getting better anytime soon I</text>
  <text start="467.39" dur="6.16">mean the real estate market you know has</text>
  <text start="471.15" dur="5.01">its ups and downs usually during the</text>
  <text start="473.55" dur="4.95">summer months is an up time during the</text>
  <text start="476.16" dur="5.28">winter it slows down a little bit but</text>
  <text start="478.5" dur="5.19">this summer we did not see this boost of</text>
  <text start="481.44" dur="5.07">real estate sales actually we&amp;#39;ve seen a</text>
  <text start="483.69" dur="8.82">lot of declines during this summer we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="486.51" dur="9.15">seen applications decline and when the</text>
  <text start="492.51" dur="5.34">central bank pushed rates up just a</text>
  <text start="495.66" dur="5.73">little bit like Volker did in nineteen</text>

  <text start="501.39" dur="8.7">crisis in 1989 or the subprime bubble of</text>
  <text start="505.8" dur="6.63">2007 guess what we saw a complete crash</text>
  <text start="510.09" dur="3.629">of the real estate market this is one of</text>
  <text start="512.43" dur="5.76">the reasons why the fed is never going</text>
  <text start="513.719" dur="7.081">to ever push real estate interest rates</text>
  <text start="518.19" dur="4.44">up if they do this is a clear sign that</text>
  <text start="520.8" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re getting ready to bring this</text>
  <text start="522.63" dur="4.17">entire economy down because they know if</text>
  <text start="524.55" dur="5.34">they push this up this whole thing comes</text>
  <text start="526.8" dur="5.55">to a complete stop and right now from</text>
  <text start="529.89" dur="4.56">the CEO of chase they are out there</text>
  <text start="532.35" dur="6.33">saying that the FHA requirements are</text>
  <text start="534.45" dur="5.34">down to a 525 coke credit scores and you</text>
  <text start="538.68" dur="5.03">only have to put three and a half</text>

  <text start="560.97" dur="9.37">prices up to keep the real estate market</text>
  <text start="564.91" dur="8.22">chugging along another telltale sign is</text>
  <text start="570.34" dur="4.89">the recent national association of</text>
  <text start="573.13" dur="4.38">realtors existing home sales data the</text>

  <text start="599.38" dur="6.39">and eventually they&amp;#39;re going to follow</text>
  <text start="602.92" dur="5.46">and we&amp;#39;ve seen this before this was back</text>
  <text start="605.77" dur="5.1">in two thousand eight we&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="608.38" dur="4.26">prior to that 2007 where everything came</text>

  <text start="635.83" dur="9.17">2008 2009 the only difference at this</text>
  <text start="639.61" dur="9.83">point is that the property bubble is</text>
  <text start="645" dur="7.69">double the size as it was in 2008 and</text>
  <text start="649.44" dur="7.36">this shows you that we&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="652.69" dur="9.78">even a bigger drop and it is going to be</text>
  <text start="656.8" dur="7.86">absolutely horrific I mean this is just</text>
