  <text start="486.95" dur="3.99">economy propped up any way they possibly</text>
  <text start="489.23" dur="4.92">can to him and they and they need to do</text>
  <text start="490.94" dur="5.25">this by manipulating everything because</text>
  <text start="494.15" dur="5.22">they cannot have it come down unless</text>
  <text start="496.19" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re going to do it in an orderly</text>
  <text start="499.37" dur="4.62">fashion this way it can be blamed on</text>
  <text start="501.74" dur="5.13">someone else this is what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="503.99" dur="5.79">to do and what&amp;#39;s very interesting after</text>
  <text start="506.87" dur="5.729">gold shot up after the market came down</text>
  <text start="509.78" dur="4.02">and people got very very nervous all of</text>
  <text start="512.599" dur="4.921">a sudden we saw something very</text>
  <text start="513.8" dur="7.2">interesting on the gold market where</text>
  <text start="517.52" dur="8.76">there were 75 gold future contracts they</text>
  <text start="521" dur="8.76">were used to spoof prices lower and once</text>
  <text start="526.28" dur="6.42">it was completed and the gold price was</text>
  <text start="529.76" dur="5.37">brought down to very close to 1,200 gold</text>
  <text start="532.7" dur="4.56">prices started to inch up a little bit</text>
  <text start="535.13" dur="4.35">and it looks like they want to keep the</text>
  <text start="537.26" dur="4.2">gold price around 1,200 or maybe a</text>
  <text start="539.48" dur="3.78">little bit under that that seems like</text>
  <text start="541.46" dur="4.62">that&amp;#39;s their comfortable position to say</text>
  <text start="543.26" dur="6.09">see the economy is fine you don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="546.08" dur="5.85">to buy gold and they&amp;#39;ll continually do</text>
  <text start="549.35" dur="7.08">this every time we see a dramatic</text>
  <text start="551.93" dur="7.32">increase in gold prices they will come</text>
  <text start="556.43" dur="6.53">out and they will suppress it very very</text>
  <text start="559.25" dur="6">quickly they cannot let gold rise</text>
  <text start="562.96" dur="5.76">because that is an indicator</text>
  <text start="565.25" dur="6.3">Shin that people are pouring their cash</text>
  <text start="568.72" dur="5.77">selling their stocks and moving into</text>
  <text start="571.55" dur="6.21">gold as an asset and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="574.49" dur="5.7">people to know this they want to keep</text>
  <text start="577.76" dur="5.82">people in the dark and this is why at</text>
  <text start="580.19" dur="5.31">this point we saw how fast gold shot up</text>
  <text start="583.58" dur="5.1">well think about it when they lose</text>
  <text start="585.5" dur="6.66">control think about it when gold is</text>
  <text start="588.68" dur="6.15">hitting 100 200 300 dollars and they</text>
  <text start="592.16" dur="5.4">cannot stop it because it&amp;#39;s out of</text>
  <text start="594.83" dur="4.47">control and that day will come they will</text>
  <text start="597.56" dur="8.79">not be able to control this and they</text>
  <text start="599.3" dur="11.22">know this we see that the UK has</text>
  <text start="606.35" dur="6.05">accelerated the gold Exodus to about</text>
  <text start="610.52" dur="5.76">five hundred and seventy three tons in</text>
  <text start="612.4" dur="6.67">December 2015 the UK has net exported</text>
  <text start="616.28" dur="5.85">184 tons of gold which is the third</text>
  <text start="619.07" dur="7.59">highest amount on record this was</text>
  <text start="622.13" dur="9.15">released by eurostat we see China they</text>
  <text start="626.66" dur="9.6">are importing gold and they&amp;#39;ve imported</text>
  <text start="631.28" dur="7.92">about 217 tons that we know of so of the</text>
  <text start="636.26" dur="5.34">total export from the UK in December 29</text>
  <text start="639.2" dur="6.18">tons were net exported directly to China</text>
  <text start="641.6" dur="6.96">and the other 155 tons were net exported</text>
  <text start="645.38" dur="8.07">to Switzerland which from there 59 tons</text>
  <text start="648.56" dur="7.41">were net exports to China so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="653.45" dur="6.62">seeing right now is everything is moving</text>
  <text start="655.97" dur="7.14">from the west to the east china is</text>
  <text start="660.07" dur="5.62">continually building up their gold</text>
  <text start="663.11" dur="4.229">reserves Russia continually building up</text>
  <text start="665.69" dur="8.19">the gold reserves and we see the Western</text>
  <text start="667.339" dur="8.941">countries dumping gold well for everyone</text>
  <text start="673.88" dur="4.38">out there you need to be prepared you</text>
  <text start="676.28" dur="3.93">need some type of precious metal does it</text>
  <text start="678.26" dur="5.22">have to be gold know it could be junk</text>
  <text start="680.21" dur="5.19">silver it could be silver eagles if you</text>
  <text start="683.48" dur="6.72">have the money to buy gold I would do</text>
  <text start="685.4" dur="8.189">that but if you have cash on hand silver</text>
  <text start="690.2" dur="5.61">is very cheap at this point I would have</text>
  <text start="693.589" dur="4.261">some of it as an insurance policy at</text>
  <text start="695.81" dur="4.32">this time</text>
  <text start="697.85" dur="5.609">other countries realize what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="700.13" dur="6.509">here and you need to protect yourself</text>
  <text start="703.459" dur="6.11">not just with a weapon not just with</text>
  <text start="706.639" dur="6.271">food but you need to protect your wealth</text>
  <text start="709.569" dur="4.871">because one all is said and done you</text>
