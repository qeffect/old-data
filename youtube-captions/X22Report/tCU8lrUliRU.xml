  <text start="112.7" dur="4.259">badly on the central bank because their</text>
  <text start="114.77" dur="4.53">product is debt they need to keep them</text>
  <text start="116.959" dur="4.741">in this limbo state now they&amp;#39;re not</text>

  <text start="129.979" dur="6.301">at many other fiscal and structural</text>
  <text start="133.04" dur="5.85">reforms and we can see right now this is</text>
  <text start="136.28" dur="5.459">what they do two countries now going</text>
  <text start="138.89" dur="5.099">back to 2008 we can see nothing has</text>
  <text start="141.739" dur="4.381">improved in Greece whatsoever even</text>
  <text start="143.989" dur="4.08">though the corporate media was out there</text>
  <text start="146.12" dur="3.839">continually telling us that things were</text>
  <text start="148.069" dur="4.92">getting better and better as time went</text>
  <text start="149.959" dur="5.941">on well they haven&amp;#39;t nothing has really</text>
  <text start="152.989" dur="5.431">changed they still have very very high</text>
  <text start="155.9" dur="5.339">unemployment they&amp;#39;re still in a huge</text>
  <text start="158.42" dur="5.73">amount of debt they still need more and</text>
  <text start="161.239" dur="6.541">more credit and they&amp;#39;re still making the</text>
  <text start="164.15" dur="5.33">people sacrifice so where&amp;#39;s anything</text>
  <text start="167.78" dur="4.289">better here there&amp;#39;s nothing better</text>
  <text start="169.48" dur="5.2">actually if they got rid of the central</text>
  <text start="172.069" dur="4.17">bank and they write off the debt things</text>
  <text start="174.68" dur="4.229">would improve dramatically look at</text>
  <text start="176.239" dur="5.341">iceland they&amp;#39;re improving this is why we</text>
  <text start="178.909" dur="5.251">don&amp;#39;t hear much about iceland what so</text>
  <text start="181.58" dur="5.04">ever as you notice we only hear about</text>
  <text start="184.16" dur="4.86">the nation&amp;#39;s that are doing terribly and</text>
  <text start="186.62" dur="4.89">the central bank and the corporate media</text>
  <text start="189.02" dur="4.98">report on them but how they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="191.51" dur="4.41">better when they&amp;#39;re really not those</text>
  <text start="194" dur="3.93">countries that got rid of the central</text>
  <text start="195.92" dur="5.16">bank they never report on how well</text>
  <text start="197.93" dur="6.57">they&amp;#39;re doing now we see that wayfair</text>
  <text start="201.08" dur="6.3">which is an online business for retail</text>
  <text start="204.5" dur="5.13">for furniture well it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="207.38" dur="3.69">in trouble right now now of course the</text>
  <text start="209.63" dur="2.76">corporate media is out there saying is</text>
  <text start="211.07" dur="3.63">because of Amazon launching their</text>
  <text start="212.39" dur="5.76">furniture seller program but we see</text>
  <text start="214.7" dur="4.86">right now that even as Amazon does this</text>
  <text start="218.15" dur="5.28">we&amp;#39;re going to see other online</text>
  <text start="219.56" dur="7.68">businesses take a hit especially those</text>
  <text start="223.43" dur="6.72">in retail because again if people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="227.24" dur="4.56">have funds to spend out in the brick or</text>
  <text start="230.15" dur="5.04">mortar stores they&amp;#39;re not going to have</text>
  <text start="231.8" dur="5.88">funds to spend online and it will not</text>
  <text start="235.19" dur="5.22">translate from brick-and-mortar to</text>
  <text start="237.68" dur="4.38">online at this point because people are</text>
  <text start="240.41" dur="4.799">still losing their jobs people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="242.06" dur="6.36">have discretionary funds and nothing has</text>
  <text start="245.209" dur="7.201">been fixed at this point now we do see a</text>
  <text start="248.42" dur="7.71">positive after 51 consecutive months the</text>
  <text start="252.41" dur="7.98">caterpillar streak has ended they have a</text>
  <text start="256.13" dur="8.13">one percent year-on-year positive growth</text>
  <text start="260.39" dur="6.99">in sales now this is the first increase</text>
  <text start="264.26" dur="4.83">since november of 2012 but then we need</text>
  <text start="267.38" dur="5.19">to look at the reason why this happened</text>
  <text start="269.09" dur="5.579">and it was China which saw a forty six</text>
  <text start="272.57" dur="4.89">percent surge in total machine sales up</text>
  <text start="274.669" dur="4.681">from thirty-nine percent last month but</text>
  <text start="277.46" dur="4.26">when we look around at the rest of the</text>
  <text start="279.35" dur="4.23">world latin america down twenty five</text>
  <text start="281.72" dur="3.93">percent north america down thirteen</text>
  <text start="283.58" dur="4.649">percent the Middle Eastern countries</text>
  <text start="285.65" dur="4.59">down three percent it doesn&amp;#39;t look good</text>
  <text start="288.229" dur="6.601">and this looks like this is a one-off</text>
  <text start="290.24" dur="8.91">thing coming out of China and we need to</text>
  <text start="294.83" dur="6.74">understand that so far IBM caterpillar</text>
  <text start="299.15" dur="5.82">many many other countries they are</text>
  <text start="301.57" dur="5.26">reporting declining sales and they are</text>
  <text start="304.97" dur="4.11">not getting better whatsoever now</text>
  <text start="306.83" dur="4.41">looking at the breakdown of what kind of</text>
  <text start="309.08" dur="4.77">machines drove the global rebound it was</text>
  <text start="311.24" dur="4.08">all construction related machinery which</text>
  <text start="313.85" dur="4.8">rose seven percent once</text>
  <text start="315.32" dur="5.52">again entirely due to China now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="318.65" dur="3.99">been looking at the economy for quite a</text>
  <text start="320.84" dur="4.29">while and we&amp;#39;re realizing that things</text>
  <text start="322.64" dur="4.32">are rapidly breaking down and we know</text>
  <text start="325.13" dur="3.42">there&amp;#39;s about eight thousand plus stores</text>
  <text start="326.96" dur="3.78">that are going to be closing this year</text>
  <text start="328.55" dur="6.12">and we know there&amp;#39;s going to be millions</text>
  <text start="330.74" dur="6.45">upon millions of retail space that is</text>
  <text start="334.67" dur="4.59">going to be available and it looks like</text>
  <text start="337.19" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s going to increase to about 147</text>
  <text start="339.26" dur="5.46">million square feet and this is a</text>
  <text start="341.93" dur="5.31">commercial real estate bubble in the</text>
  <text start="344.72" dur="4.56">making we know that the Atlanta Fed GDP</text>

  <text start="351.8" dur="4.92">experiencing their toughest stretch</text>
  <text start="353.51" dur="4.67">since the last recession foot traffic at</text>
  <text start="356.72" dur="3.65">chain restaurants in March drop</text>
  <text start="358.18" dur="4.72">three-point-four percent from a year ago</text>
  <text start="360.37" dur="4.9">menu prices couldn&amp;#39;t be increased enough</text>
  <text start="362.9" dur="7.23">to make up for it and same-store saw</text>
  <text start="365.27" dur="6.96">sales fell by 1.1 percent in March us</text>
  <text start="370.13" dur="4.65">factory output decline at the fastest</text>
  <text start="372.23" dur="5.37">pace in more than two years according to</text>
  <text start="374.78" dur="5.31">the BLS not a single person is employed</text>
  <text start="377.6" dur="5.43">in nearly one out of every five us</text>
  <text start="380.09" dur="5.31">families US government revenues just</text>
  <text start="383.03" dur="4.95">suffered their biggest drop since the</text>
  <text start="385.4" dur="5.1">last recession nearly all the big</text>
  <text start="387.98" dur="5.13">automakers report reported disappointing</text>
  <text start="390.5" dur="5.19">sales in March and dealer inventories</text>
  <text start="393.11" dur="4.74">have now risen to the highest level that</text>
  <text start="395.69" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;ve seen since the last recession and</text>
  <text start="397.85" dur="5.31">we know that use vehicle prices well</text>
  <text start="400.58" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re crashing right now at this point</text>
  <text start="403.16" dur="8.34">most US consumers are completely tapped</text>
  <text start="406.97" dur="5.73">out and six out of ten Americans well</text>
  <text start="411.5" dur="3.3">they don&amp;#39;t have enough money to save</text>
  <text start="412.7" dur="6.27">even to cover a five-hundred-dollar</text>
  <text start="414.8" dur="6.9">emergency costs just like in 2008 debts</text>
  <text start="418.97" dur="4.86">are going bad at a very alarming pace in</text>
  <text start="421.7" dur="4.35">fact things have already gotten so bad</text>
  <text start="423.83" dur="4.89">that the IMF has issued a major warning</text>
  <text start="426.05" dur="5.48">about it in America alone bad debt held</text>
  <text start="428.72" dur="5.49">by companies could reach 4 trillion</text>
  <text start="431.53" dur="4.84">dollars or almost a quarter of corporate</text>
  <text start="434.21" dur="3.93">assets considered that debt could</text>
  <text start="436.37" dur="4.5">undermine financial stability if</text>
  <text start="438.14" dur="5.04">mishandled this is coming from the IMF</text>
  <text start="440.87" dur="4.26">so when we look at all of this that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="443.18" dur="4.739">been happening here we can see that the</text>
  <text start="445.13" dur="3.93">economy has been deteriorating very very</text>
  <text start="447.919" dur="3.391">quickly it is</text>
  <text start="449.06" dur="5.22">not improved it is not getting better</text>
  <text start="451.31" dur="4.8">and those country where the IMF to EU</text>
  <text start="454.28" dur="3.84">and the corporate media has been telling</text>
  <text start="456.11" dur="3.21">us that things are getting better it</text>
  <text start="458.12" dur="4.74">looks like we&amp;#39;re seeing an improvement</text>
  <text start="459.32" dur="6.69">they haven&amp;#39;t and we&amp;#39;re looking at this</text>
  <text start="462.86" dur="5.7">every couple of months and we can see</text>
  <text start="466.01" dur="6.18">that nothing has improved whatsoever</text>
  <text start="468.56" dur="7.38">it&amp;#39;s only gotten worse and who has to</text>
  <text start="472.19" dur="7.71">sacrifice every single time it is the</text>
  <text start="475.94" dur="6">people now we know that the banks in</text>
  <text start="479.9" dur="4.95">Europe they are in big trouble right now</text>
  <text start="481.94" dur="5.13">and we know that the banks in Spain</text>
  <text start="484.85" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re having a huge amount of trouble</text>
  <text start="487.07" dur="6.63">banco popular well looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="490.76" dur="6.3">going to have a huge problem coming up</text>
  <text start="493.7" dur="6.27">very very soon because they must pull in</text>
  <text start="497.06" dur="6">another capital expansion this time</text>
  <text start="499.97" dur="6.06">around four billion euros last time they</text>

  <text start="548.21" dur="4.05">the bank lost about six point five</text>
  <text start="549.8" dur="5.31">percent of the of its deposits base and</text>
  <text start="552.26" dur="4.74">it is growing right now and accelerating</text>

  <text start="642.829" dur="5.401">only have a certain amount of time left</text>
  <text start="645.35" dur="5.31">and this means that as we move</text>
  <text start="648.23" dur="3.99">throughout this year it the data is just</text>
