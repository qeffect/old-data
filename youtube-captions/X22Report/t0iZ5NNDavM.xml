  <text start="233.23" dur="6.12">easy to get a mortgage today we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="236.56" dur="4.86">taking in subprime people you only have</text>
  <text start="239.35" dur="3.66">to put like one percent or three and a</text>
  <text start="241.42" dur="3.48">half percent down and the special</text>

  <text start="256.81" dur="5.73">bring in as many people as they possibly</text>
  <text start="259.9" dur="4.17">can and then all of a sudden the system</text>
  <text start="262.54" dur="3.48">is going to come crashing down this is</text>
  <text start="264.07" dur="4.23">what happened back in two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="266.02" dur="4.44">and we are headed in the same exact</text>
  <text start="268.3" dur="5.82">direction now it looks like industrial</text>
  <text start="270.46" dur="5.489">production fell by 0.1% in August</text>
  <text start="274.12" dur="4.38">missed about point two eight percent</text>
  <text start="275.949" dur="5.22">expectations for its worst prince since</text>

  <text start="299.08" dur="6.18">percent manufacturing driven as</text>
  <text start="301.78" dur="6.509">production slump by 0.4% month on month</text>
  <text start="305.26" dur="5.279">it&amp;#39;s worth since January now we talked</text>
  <text start="308.289" dur="3.571">about automobiles a lot and we</text>
  <text start="310.539" dur="3.991">understand that the automobile industry</text>
  <text start="311.86" dur="5.19">is bringing in subprime people if you</text>
  <text start="314.53" dur="5.25">have a heartbeat you can get a auto loan</text>
  <text start="317.05" dur="6.239">and you can be placed right into a car</text>
  <text start="319.78" dur="5.91">but what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that late</text>
  <text start="323.289" dur="4.171">payments are going up delinquencies are</text>

  <text start="334.449" dur="4.561">well manufacturing was doing well and</text>
  <text start="337.12" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;re starting to see things really</text>
  <text start="339.01" dur="3.96">start to fall apart right now and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="341.38" dur="5.55">starting to see that motor vehicles and</text>
  <text start="342.97" dur="6.99">parts are after posting the best numbers</text>
  <text start="346.93" dur="5.76">in five years they&amp;#39;ve just post the</text>
  <text start="349.96" dur="6.06">worst monthly drop in five years or</text>

  <text start="1491.979" dur="4.56">trying to push out the puppet regime and</text>
  <text start="1494.08" dur="4.799">this is the reason why the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1496.539" dur="3.901">was let loose because eventually what</text>
  <text start="1498.879" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1500.44" dur="4.169">have the Islamic state infiltrate all of</text>

  <text start="1558.009" dur="4.38">Arab Emirates and other Arab countries</text>
  <text start="1560.139" dur="3.87">and we know all of this is being</text>

  <text start="1564.009" dur="3.691">bankers none of these countries are not</text>
  <text start="1566.139" dur="4.38">going to do it without the authorization</text>
  <text start="1567.7" dur="6.809">from them and we can see right now these</text>
  <text start="1570.519" dur="6.24">airstrikes hit western town near the</text>
  <text start="1574.509" dur="4.951">capital Tripoli they hit an ammunition</text>

  <text start="1581.619" dur="3.601">over Libya and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1583.179" dur="4.35">continually push them back and back and</text>
  <text start="1585.22" dur="5.189">back but it really isn&amp;#39;t working because</text>
  <text start="1587.529" dur="5.49">air power doesn&amp;#39;t work you actually need</text>

  <text start="1600.849" dur="4.8">is out there and if you noticed the</text>
  <text start="1603.34" dur="5.25">Islamic state is kind of staying away</text>
  <text start="1605.649" dur="5.16">from Israel mom we know the head of the</text>
  <text start="1608.59" dur="3.13">Islamic state is a Mossad agent we know</text>
  <text start="1610.809" dur="2.921">they work with</text>
  <text start="1611.72" dur="4.589">the United States with UK to create the</text>

  <text start="1621.71" dur="4.56">well that&amp;#39;s a safe thing for them</text>
  <text start="1624.47" dur="4.079">because we know it&amp;#39;s not going to impact</text>
  <text start="1626.27" dur="3.84">Jordan because Jordan was the place</text>
  <text start="1628.549" dur="4.141">where all these people were trained</text>
  <text start="1630.11" dur="5.13">supplied the weapons and this is the</text>
  <text start="1632.69" dur="4.83">launching pad for many of them so of</text>
  <text start="1635.24" dur="4.919">course this statement is absolutely</text>
  <text start="1637.52" dur="4.74">meaningless the Islamic state is only</text>

  <text start="1651.049" dur="6">we can see those are the only places</text>
  <text start="1652.88" dur="6.36">where the Islamic state wants to go now</text>

  <text start="1681.289" dur="5.281">region also but guess what they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1683.96" dur="5.219">asking Russia for any type of help</text>
  <text start="1686.57" dur="4.229">actually because they know eventually</text>
  <text start="1689.179" dur="3.151">they&amp;#39;ll be fighting against Russia</text>
  <text start="1690.799" dur="4.141">because this whole thing is a</text>

  <text start="2182.64" dur="4.439">some big event because if they go to the</text>
  <text start="2184.17" dur="4.53">UN Security Council right now what is</text>
  <text start="2187.079" dur="2.821">their motivation of getting it to Syria</text>
  <text start="2188.7" dur="3.48">because there&amp;#39;s a terrorist group in</text>

  <text start="2203.759" dur="5.641">United Nations in helping them get into</text>
  <text start="2206.97" dur="5.22">Syria and again the United States has</text>
  <text start="2209.4" dur="5.399">not been attacked by Syria whatsoever</text>
  <text start="2212.19" dur="4.44">this is a terrorist group that is now in</text>

  <text start="2222.69" dur="5.01">special event where they can say Syria</text>
  <text start="2225.239" dur="4.441">combined with the Islamic state attack</text>
  <text start="2227.7" dur="4.559">the United States and this is what</text>
  <text start="2229.68" dur="5.309">they&amp;#39;re trying to do at this time now</text>
  <text start="2232.259" dur="4.711">Russia is out there and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>

  <text start="2240.9" dur="5.369">assets to help them fight the terrorism</text>
  <text start="2243.66" dur="4.829">group and of course this puts Russia on</text>
  <text start="2246.269" dur="5.34">the other side because the United States</text>
  <text start="2248.489" dur="4.891">believes that Assad is a terrorist does</text>
  <text start="2251.609" dur="3.601">not and it also believe that he is not</text>
  <text start="2253.38" dur="3.75">the elected official so eventually</text>
  <text start="2255.21" dur="3.72">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is it will be the</text>

  <text start="2269.609" dur="5.551">lines are being drawn right now in this</text>
  <text start="2271.95" dur="7.54">area and of course Obama after his</text>

  <text start="2493.45" dur="5.52">night clubs and cafes and to blend in</text>
  <text start="2496.72" dur="4.74">and of course what we&amp;#39;re going to see is</text>
  <text start="2498.97" dur="4.65">most likely a bombing or something that</text>
  <text start="2501.46" dur="4.11">occurs in Lebanon they&amp;#39;ll say this is</text>
  <text start="2503.62" dur="4.2">the Islamic state they&amp;#39;re inside there</text>
  <text start="2505.57" dur="5.13">this is one of the cells and they took</text>
  <text start="2507.82" dur="5.91">out a you know a business or something</text>
  <text start="2510.7" dur="5.58">like that and now wherever the Islamic</text>
  <text start="2513.73" dur="4.14">state is that&amp;#39;s where Obama can go and</text>
  <text start="2516.28" dur="5.13">we can see how they&amp;#39;re playing this up</text>
  <text start="2517.87" dur="6.03">really really big now it looks like the</text>
  <text start="2521.41" dur="4.59">United States UK Israel they are</text>
  <text start="2523.9" dur="5.04">following the script because we saw</text>
  <text start="2526" dur="6.21">another beheading we had James Foley we</text>
  <text start="2528.94" dur="6.03">have sea salt loss and now we have David</text>
  <text start="2532.21" dur="5.28">Haynes and we can see that all of this</text>
  <text start="2534.97" dur="5.61">is being done it&amp;#39;s part of the script to</text>
  <text start="2537.49" dur="5.79">get everyone all riled up and we can see</text>
  <text start="2540.58" dur="4.86">that every time these videos come out we</text>
  <text start="2543.28" dur="2.64">see less and less of what&amp;#39;s really going</text>
  <text start="2545.44" dur="2.429">on because</text>
  <text start="2545.92" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re realizing that people are</text>
  <text start="2547.869" dur="4.591">picking it apart saying this is fake</text>
  <text start="2550.24" dur="4.349">that&amp;#39;s not real and pretty soon you</text>
  <text start="2552.46" dur="5.07">won&amp;#39;t even see any more videos they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2554.589" dur="5.341">just tell you about it because what you</text>
  <text start="2557.53" dur="4.35">can&amp;#39;t see you can&amp;#39;t pick apart and this</text>
  <text start="2559.93" dur="5.24">is exactly what&amp;#39;s happening they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2561.88" dur="6.6">trying to use this to bring the people</text>
  <text start="2565.17" dur="4.57">together to say we need to go into the</text>
  <text start="2568.48" dur="3.71">Islamic state but I don&amp;#39;t really think</text>
  <text start="2569.74" dur="4.559">it&amp;#39;s working I think a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="2572.19" dur="4.119">looking at this saying yes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2574.299" dur="5.52">beheaded but I don&amp;#39;t think we really</text>
  <text start="2576.309" dur="5.28">want to go to war over this right now we</text>
  <text start="2579.819" dur="4.141">should let the other countries take care</text>
  <text start="2581.589" dur="3.96">of what&amp;#39;s going on yeah maybe we can do</text>
  <text start="2583.96" dur="2.94">some air strikes but we don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="2585.549" dur="3.75">have any boots on the ground and this is</text>
  <text start="2586.9" dur="3.99">why they&amp;#39;re saying the government</text>
  <text start="2589.299" dur="3">officials like kerry and obama are</text>
  <text start="2590.89" dur="3.54">saying they&amp;#39;re going to be no boots on</text>
  <text start="2592.299" dur="4.201">the ground but eventually we already</text>
  <text start="2594.43" dur="4.86">know that there will be and there</text>
  <text start="2596.5" dur="5.76">already is and a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="2599.29" dur="4.799">moving away from maybe we shouldn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="2602.26" dur="3.66">involved with this and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="2604.089" dur="4.171">see the poll numbers start to fluctuate</text>
  <text start="2605.92" dur="4.5">and when we see this wit means we need</text>
  <text start="2608.26" dur="3.75">to have some type of an event because</text>
  <text start="2610.42" dur="3.81">the central bankers are not getting what</text>
  <text start="2612.01" dur="5.059">they want during the last incident back</text>
  <text start="2614.23" dur="6.089">in august of 2013 moving into September</text>
  <text start="2617.069" dur="7.061">Congress the people were not for going</text>
  <text start="2620.319" dur="5.581">into Syria whatsoever and again they had</text>
  <text start="2624.13" dur="3.419">no way of getting in there because Syria</text>
  <text start="2625.9" dur="3.63">never really attacked the United States</text>
  <text start="2627.549" dur="4.381">so there was no way of getting in there</text>
  <text start="2629.53" dur="5.61">the same things happening again they</text>
  <text start="2631.93" dur="6.869">can&amp;#39;t go into Syria because Syria has</text>
  <text start="2635.14" dur="6.479">absolutely done nothing now remember</text>
  <text start="2638.799" dur="5.401">those Libyan aircraft i think was 11 or</text>
  <text start="2641.619" dur="4.771">12 of them that were stolen well it</text>
  <text start="2644.2" dur="4.95">looks like Alex from Athens pointed me</text>
  <text start="2646.39" dur="5.969">in this direction of this report where</text>
  <text start="2649.15" dur="6.12">it says that announced mouth and he&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="2652.359" dur="4.381">the people he lives in Greece and that</text>
  <text start="2655.27" dur="3.72">what we&amp;#39;re seeing now is that these</text>
  <text start="2656.74" dur="5.51">missing Libyan aircraft well it could</text>
  <text start="2658.99" dur="6.03">really be confirmed these planes that</text>
  <text start="2662.25" dur="4.839">they&amp;#39;re saying are missing first of all</text>
  <text start="2665.02" dur="4.41">a lot of them were destroyed they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2667.089" dur="5.101">saying none of them were taken off but</text>
  <text start="2669.43" dur="6.899">what they are reporting is that a couple</text>
  <text start="2672.19" dur="7.07">months back to airplanes were stolen and</text>
  <text start="2676.329" dur="4.281">they were two airbus a320s</text>
  <text start="2679.26" dur="4.47">and they were owned by the Libyan</text>
  <text start="2680.61" dur="4.86">company and the transponders were turned</text>
  <text start="2683.73" dur="3.84">off they don&amp;#39;t know where they are but</text>
  <text start="2685.47" dur="4.56">the other airplanes this is more</text>
  <text start="2687.57" dur="4.71">propaganda out there trying to convince</text>
  <text start="2690.03" dur="4.68">everyone that all these plans all these</text>
  <text start="2692.28" dur="4.14">planes are missing and it seems like</text>
  <text start="2694.71" dur="6.42">there&amp;#39;s really only two we also have to</text>
  <text start="2696.42" dur="9.21">remember there is a another plane in</text>
  <text start="2701.13" dur="6.78">Israel&amp;#39;s hangar that mimics the mh370</text>
  <text start="2705.63" dur="5.07">plane that went missing it is the same</text>
  <text start="2707.91" dur="5.01">model except it has a longer range of</text>
  <text start="2710.7" dur="4.59">flight than the one that went missing</text>
  <text start="2712.92" dur="5.04">and we can see with all these planes</text>
  <text start="2715.29" dur="4.56">missing something could occur our</text>
  <text start="2717.96" dur="3.54">government officials are out there</text>
  <text start="2719.85" dur="4.52">telling us that yes something could</text>
  <text start="2721.5" dur="5.79">happen Obama is continually claiming</text>
  <text start="2724.37" dur="4.93">playing everything down Ebola is not</text>
  <text start="2727.29" dur="5.91">coming into the United States you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2729.3" dur="6.75">have to worry about it DHS FBI and Obama</text>
  <text start="2733.2" dur="4.68">all says they are not seeing any type of</text>
  <text start="2736.05" dur="5.49">threat to the United States from the</text>
  <text start="2737.88" dur="8.34">Islamic state and this gives us concern</text>
  <text start="2741.54" dur="6.45">right now because again DHS FBI never</text>
  <text start="2746.22" dur="3.96">told us anything they never said</text>
  <text start="2747.99" dur="5.52">anything about the Boston bombing they</text>
  <text start="2750.18" dur="5.55">never reported anything in 911 so right</text>
  <text start="2753.51" dur="3.78">now they all just played it down during</text>
  <text start="2755.73" dur="2.7">this time there were never any alerts</text>
  <text start="2757.29" dur="3.33">and they&amp;#39;re doing the same thing right</text>
  <text start="2758.43" dur="3.84">now they&amp;#39;re kind of playing it down</text>
  <text start="2760.62" dur="3.48">saying there&amp;#39;s nothing really out there</text>
  <text start="2762.27" dur="5.84">and this shows us from all these</text>
  <text start="2764.1" dur="7.23">incidents that they really the whole</text>
  <text start="2768.11" dur="7.48">apparatus they constructed doesn&amp;#39;t isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2771.33" dur="7.04">is does not stop terrorism or it shows</text>
  <text start="2775.59" dur="5.94">us that they&amp;#39;re behind the terrorism</text>
  <text start="2778.37" dur="4.87">this is why they don&amp;#39;t report it this is</text>
  <text start="2781.53" dur="3.27">why they don&amp;#39;t tell you what&amp;#39;s coming up</text>
  <text start="2783.24" dur="4.59">because they&amp;#39;re the ones who are</text>
  <text start="2784.8" dur="4.83">creating the terrorism and we can see</text>
  <text start="2787.83" dur="4.2">right now if you go to DHS alert system</text>
  <text start="2789.63" dur="4.53">is no alerts for any time during the</text>
  <text start="2792.03" dur="5.07">Boston bombing during anything else</text>
  <text start="2794.16" dur="4.68">never any type of alert whatsoever we do</text>
  <text start="2797.1" dur="5.1">see other countries raising their alerts</text>
  <text start="2798.84" dur="5.28">Australia has raised their alert UK has</text>
  <text start="2802.2" dur="3.66">raised their alert and the United States</text>
  <text start="2804.12" dur="6.39">is saying we see absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="2805.86" dur="6.81">because we know right now the FBI DHS</text>
  <text start="2810.51" dur="4.109">CIA is</text>
  <text start="2812.67" dur="4.83">Grill and other countries are all going</text>
  <text start="2814.619" dur="6.571">to be involved in creating this event to</text>
  <text start="2817.5" dur="6.059">convince all the countries the people of</text>
  <text start="2821.19" dur="4.95">the united states that we need to go</text>
  <text start="2823.559" dur="4.981">into Syria now they have to do something</text>
  <text start="2826.14" dur="5.34">where Syria is involved i just can&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="2828.54" dur="5.549">the islamic state did this they need to</text>
  <text start="2831.48" dur="4.95">kind of intertwine Syria into this</text>
  <text start="2834.089" dur="4.321">somehow someway of course this is why</text>
  <text start="2836.43" dur="4.159">they&amp;#39;ve been bringing up the chlorine</text>
  <text start="2838.41" dur="6.03">gas reports to keep this property</text>
  <text start="2840.589" dur="5.621">propaganda to remind everyone that Assad</text>
  <text start="2844.44" dur="5.31">used chemical weapons when he never</text>
  <text start="2846.21" dur="5.879">really did and we also see that they</text>
  <text start="2849.75" dur="5.13">have someone in Congress testifying that</text>
  <text start="2852.089" dur="5.581">Assad committed war crimes which is of</text>
  <text start="2854.88" dur="4.83">course never proven these pictures that</text>
  <text start="2857.67" dur="3.27">they are showing or from a hospital you</text>
  <text start="2859.71" dur="3.659">don&amp;#39;t know where these people were</text>
  <text start="2860.94" dur="5.159">tortured whatsoever and of course if he</text>
  <text start="2863.369" dur="4.68">was an inside man and his name is code</text>
  <text start="2866.099" dur="4.5">name is Caesar he would have had</text>
  <text start="2868.049" dur="4.471">pictures inside the prison&amp;#39;s showing the</text>
  <text start="2870.599" dur="3.871">torture go on but anybody could take</text>
  <text start="2872.52" dur="3.96">pictures in the hospitals afterwards</text>
  <text start="2874.47" dur="4.23">they also show the pictures of the gas</text>
  <text start="2876.48" dur="4.2">victims which doesn&amp;#39;t show who did it</text>
  <text start="2878.7" dur="4.47">either it just shows the aftermath of</text>
  <text start="2880.68" dur="4.889">what happened and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="2883.17" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re trying to link Syria with the</text>
  <text start="2885.569" dur="4.921">Islamic state but this is all kind of</text>
  <text start="2888" dur="4.38">falling apart but again they do have</text>
  <text start="2890.49" dur="4.109">something planned this is all propaganda</text>
