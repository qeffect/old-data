  <text start="117.33" dur="3.899">central bank created this economy they</text>
  <text start="119.28" dur="3.42">created an entire bubble with</text>
  <text start="121.229" dur="6.271">manipulated information from the</text>
  <text start="122.7" dur="8.22">government and they did it so the elite</text>
  <text start="127.5" dur="6">the wealthy got wealthier and the rest</text>
  <text start="130.92" dur="5.19">of the people what happened there all</text>

  <text start="142.56" dur="5.52">right now retail is contracting the</text>
  <text start="144.599" dur="6.961">housing bubble is coming down the main</text>
  <text start="148.08" dur="5.549">problem is the government is the central</text>
  <text start="151.56" dur="6.45">bank they&amp;#39;re the ones who caused all of</text>
  <text start="153.629" dur="8.511">this and made it a lot worse so he&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="158.01" dur="6.03">there and we&amp;#39;ve seen this before in 2008</text>
  <text start="162.14" dur="5.409">when they came out</text>
  <text start="164.04" dur="5.039">during the spring and summer telling us</text>
  <text start="167.549" dur="4.86">that everything&amp;#39;s contained everything</text>
  <text start="169.079" dur="5.701">is fine don&amp;#39;t worry about it housing</text>
  <text start="172.409" dur="5.16">never goes down we&amp;#39;re not forecasting</text>
  <text start="174.78" dur="7.379">any type of recession here we are once</text>
  <text start="177.569" dur="8.79">again they&amp;#39;re doing the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="182.159" dur="6.901">and we&amp;#39;ve been tracking and looking at</text>
  <text start="186.359" dur="5.88">all the information and what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="189.06" dur="7.2">seeing is that this economy is declining</text>
  <text start="192.239" dur="6.541">and declining very fast and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="196.26" dur="5.97">going to improve it&amp;#39;s going to get worse</text>
  <text start="198.78" dur="7.53">as time goes on but like I said look at</text>
  <text start="202.23" dur="6.899">certain indicators look at gold we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="206.31" dur="5.819">had a small little suppression gold now</text>
  <text start="209.129" dur="4.651">has risen once again this is something</text>
  <text start="212.129" dur="3.631">we need to watch because think about it</text>
  <text start="213.78" dur="3.929">when gold starts getting around fifteen</text>
  <text start="215.76" dur="4.619">sixteen seventeen two thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="217.709" dur="4.62">an ounce people are going to take notice</text>
  <text start="220.379" dur="4.321">what do you think is going to happen at</text>
  <text start="222.329" dur="3.921">that point people are going to say we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="224.7" dur="4.83">wait a minute what&amp;#39;s going on here is</text>
  <text start="226.25" dur="8.199">the value of the dollar declining that</text>
  <text start="229.53" dur="6.78">quickly is the manipulation over should</text>
  <text start="234.449" dur="4.051">I take my money out of the stock market</text>
  <text start="236.31" dur="5.099">and put it into hard assets and this is</text>
  <text start="238.5" dur="5.609">what people are going to do they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="241.409" dur="5.851">going to do this now very interestingly</text>
  <text start="244.109" dur="4.651">a listener email may only oh say his</text>
  <text start="247.26" dur="3.539">first name Marvin Marvin thank you very</text>
  <text start="248.76" dur="5.069">much for pointing this out and if you</text>
  <text start="250.799" dur="5.22">look at the u.s. debt clock and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="253.829" dur="6.21">u.s. debt clock org the bottom</text>
  <text start="256.019" dur="6.27">right-hand corner it shows gold and</text>
  <text start="260.039" dur="6.571">silver back in 1913 how much they were</text>
  <text start="262.289" dur="7.44">per ounce and it shows the current value</text>
  <text start="266.61" dur="7.32">of gold and silver today using the m2</text>
  <text start="269.729" dur="6.901">money supply and the devaluation of the</text>
  <text start="273.93" dur="4.95">currency and what they&amp;#39;re reporting at</text>
  <text start="276.63" dur="3.69">this point in time and I don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="278.88" dur="3.48">accurate it&amp;#39;s probably very close</text>
  <text start="280.32" dur="5.189">actually but they&amp;#39;re saying that go</text>
  <text start="282.36" dur="6">silver is around seven hundred and</text>
  <text start="285.509" dur="6.331">seventy nine dollars per ounce and gold</text>
  <text start="288.36" dur="6.09">is around seven thousand or so dollars</text>
  <text start="291.84" dur="4.949">per ounce now think about this today</text>
  <text start="294.45" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re telling us the gold is around</text>
  <text start="296.789" dur="3.211">1,200</text>
  <text start="297.78" dur="4.73">and ninety dollars and silver is around</text>
  <text start="300" dur="5.34">seventeen or eighteen dollars per ounce</text>
  <text start="302.51" dur="6.97">so at this point you can see that they</text>
  <text start="305.34" dur="7.86">are on sale now we know that Deutsche</text>
  <text start="309.48" dur="6.81">Bank Nova Scotia USB and many other</text>
  <text start="313.2" dur="5.45">banks are all in in manipulating gold</text>
  <text start="316.29" dur="4.349">and silver and we know the central bank</text>
  <text start="318.65" dur="4.72">they&amp;#39;re controlling the entire</text>
  <text start="320.639" dur="4.441">manipulation when this manipulation</text>
  <text start="323.37" dur="3.96">breaks and when people start to realize</text>
  <text start="325.08" dur="5.61">that gold and silver are worth a lot</text>
  <text start="327.33" dur="5.46">more than they&amp;#39;re stating today you will</text>
  <text start="330.69" dur="4.68">not be able to get it now I don&amp;#39;t so</text>
  <text start="332.79" dur="4.44">gold or silver anything like that I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="335.37" dur="3.75">tell you where I get mine I have no</text>
  <text start="337.23" dur="4.8">relationship to them whatsoever i get</text>
  <text start="339.12" dur="5.73">mine at american precious metal exchange</text>
  <text start="342.03" dur="6.66">and i&amp;#39;ve been doing I&amp;#39;ve been using them</text>
  <text start="344.85" dur="8.4">for many many years at this point I</text>
  <text start="348.69" dur="11.88">would suggest getting some gold and</text>
  <text start="353.25" dur="11.43">silver before it is too late now out in</text>
  <text start="360.57" dur="7.65">Germany what we are seeing is that all</text>
  <text start="364.68" dur="5.76">the bailouts that Greece has been</text>
  <text start="368.22" dur="4.199">getting they have been going to the</text>
  <text start="370.44" dur="5.84">banks about ninety-five percent of the</text>
  <text start="372.419" dur="9.151">bailouts about 220 billion euros went to</text>
  <text start="376.28" dur="8.98">the banks creditors only 5% ended up in</text>
  <text start="381.57" dur="5.67">the state coffers went to the people and</text>
  <text start="385.26" dur="3.27">this is coming from a study by the</text>
  <text start="387.24" dur="4.17">European school of management and</text>
  <text start="388.53" dur="5.04">technology and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="391.41" dur="5.55">now is this is how it is in every</text>
  <text start="393.57" dur="5.67">country they put them into debt and they</text>
  <text start="396.96" dur="6.45">stay in debt because they have to pay</text>
  <text start="399.24" dur="7.76">all the interest back to the creditors</text>
  <text start="403.41" dur="6.66">back to the banks and the people they</text>
  <text start="407" dur="6.82">get absolutely nothing well what they do</text>
  <text start="410.07" dur="8.12">get is they get more debt they get less</text>
  <text start="413.82" dur="6.87">jobs they get a devaluing currency and</text>
  <text start="418.19" dur="4.51">it does not work out for the people now</text>
  <text start="420.69" dur="3.9">here in the United States we got some</text>
  <text start="422.7" dur="4.55">numbers today we cut the payroll numbers</text>
  <text start="424.59" dur="5.819">and the payroll numbers only rose about</text>
  <text start="427.25" dur="3.69">160,000 far below the 200,000 that are</text>
  <text start="430.409" dur="2.271">expecting</text>
  <text start="430.94" dur="5.55">we understand there were a lot of</text>
  <text start="432.68" dur="5.85">layoffs going on right now and I think</text>
  <text start="436.49" dur="4.74">it was very difficult for the government</text>
  <text start="438.53" dur="5.25">to manipulate these numbers the way they</text>
  <text start="441.23" dur="4.29">really would like to and we see that the</text>
  <text start="443.78" dur="3.39">unemployment rate has stayed at around</text>
  <text start="445.52" dur="3.93">five percent they thought it was going</text>
  <text start="447.17" dur="4.32">to drop to 4.9 percent but don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="449.45" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re going to revise manipulate and</text>
  <text start="451.49" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re going to try to get this under</text>
  <text start="453.17" dur="3.54">five percent anyway they possibly can I</text>
  <text start="455.33" dur="3.09">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if the next</text>
  <text start="456.71" dur="3.24">go-around they bring it down to four</text>
  <text start="458.42" dur="3.66">point eight percent right before the</text>
  <text start="459.95" dur="5.28">elections to make it look really really</text>
  <text start="462.08" dur="5.94">good now the number of Americans not in</text>
  <text start="465.23" dur="8.01">the labor force it is sore it has soared</text>
  <text start="468.02" dur="7.26">to 562 thousand in April pushing the</text>
  <text start="473.24" dur="5.61">grand total of people not in the labor</text>
  <text start="475.28" dur="5.73">force over 94 million and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="478.85" dur="4.41">approaching the all-time highs when</text>
  <text start="481.01" dur="5.1">we&amp;#39;re reaching 90 4.6 million once again</text>
  <text start="483.26" dur="5.16">and what&amp;#39;s happening right now is that a</text>
  <text start="486.11" dur="4.2">lot of companies are continually laying</text>
  <text start="488.42" dur="3.93">off and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that the</text>
  <text start="490.31" dur="3.45">manipulation it&amp;#39;s getting harder and</text>
  <text start="492.35" dur="3.33">harder for the government to keep up</text>
  <text start="493.76" dur="5.84">with all of this now the participation</text>
  <text start="495.68" dur="7.32">rate in April is now 62.8 percent and</text>
  <text start="499.6" dur="4.78">this is not good this is telling us that</text>
  <text start="503" dur="4.05">all these people that are losing the</text>
  <text start="504.38" dur="5.37">jobs they&amp;#39;re not finding the same high</text>
  <text start="507.05" dur="4.619">quality paying jobs a lot of them maybe</text>
  <text start="509.75" dur="4.14">are if they&amp;#39;re lucky finding the low</text>
  <text start="511.669" dur="4.081">paying jobs but most of them are out of</text>
  <text start="513.89" dur="4.11">the labor force and this is why when we</text>
  <text start="515.75" dur="3.9">looked at all the information a lot of</text>
  <text start="518" dur="3.06">the government statistical information</text>
  <text start="519.65" dur="5.76">compared to what we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="521.06" dur="6.21">it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense now we already</text>
  <text start="525.41" dur="4.35">know the quantity of the April jobs</text>
  <text start="527.27" dur="5.97">which was very disappointing but what</text>
  <text start="529.76" dur="6">about the quality and in April what</text>
  <text start="533.24" dur="5.099">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that retail dropped</text>
  <text start="535.76" dur="6.87">quite a bit construction dropped quite a</text>
  <text start="538.339" dur="7.471">bit and what increased professional</text>
  <text start="542.63" dur="7.26">business services and what that is is</text>
  <text start="545.81" dur="7.83">temp help and that&amp;#39;s all a 56,000</text>
  <text start="549.89" dur="6.84">increase in April so we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot</text>
  <text start="553.64" dur="7.83">of temp help we&amp;#39;re seeing everything</text>
  <text start="556.73" dur="8.03">else decline and manufacturing is not</text>
  <text start="561.47" dur="5.75">doing well whatsoever and at this point</text>
  <text start="564.76" dur="7.49">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that since December</text>
  <text start="567.22" dur="8.27">of 2014 the US has added just under</text>
  <text start="572.25" dur="7.69">450,000 waiters and bartenders and no</text>
  <text start="575.49" dur="8.13">manufacturing workers this is not a good</text>
  <text start="579.94" dur="7.35">sign this will not help the economy</text>
  <text start="583.62" dur="5.86">whatsoever and this is why Obama he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="587.29" dur="5.16">trying to explain what is happening here</text>
  <text start="589.48" dur="5.04">now when we look at the class 8 truck</text>
  <text start="592.45" dur="4.77">orders because we looked at the rail</text>
  <text start="594.52" dur="5.55">traffic we look at the air freight all</text>
  <text start="597.22" dur="6.06">declining we mentioned the class a truck</text>
  <text start="600.07" dur="6.48">orders once before well they are</text>
  <text start="603.28" dur="5.34">plunging by thirty-nine percent the</text>
  <text start="606.55" dur="4.68">heavy-duty truck orders they are</text>
  <text start="608.62" dur="6.09">declining last month trucking fleets</text>
  <text start="611.23" dur="5.58">ordered just around 13,500 class 8</text>
  <text start="614.71" dur="5.13">trucks the big rigs used on long-haul</text>
  <text start="616.81" dur="4.11">routes down sixteen percent from March</text>
  <text start="619.84" dur="4.5">and thirty-nine percent from a year</text>
  <text start="620.92" dur="8.07">earlier it was the fewest net orders in</text>
  <text start="624.34" dur="9.27">April since 2009 we are back to that</text>
  <text start="628.99" dur="9.69">area and we are seeing that all of this</text>
  <text start="633.61" dur="8.19">is trending downward loads available for</text>
  <text start="638.68" dur="4.74">dry vans now what that is these are the</text>
  <text start="641.8" dur="3.72">most common type of tractor trailers</text>
  <text start="643.42" dur="4.38">used for shipping like consumer goods</text>
  <text start="645.52" dur="5.37">and things like that they fell by</text>
  <text start="647.8" dur="6.3">twenty-eight percent in April now engine</text>
  <text start="650.89" dur="5.58">maker Cummins said on Tuesday it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="654.1" dur="6">expect any improvement in the truck</text>
  <text start="656.47" dur="5.43">market later in the year it now expects</text>
  <text start="660.1" dur="3.72">heavy-duty truck production in North</text>
  <text start="661.9" dur="4.68">America to be about two hundred and ten</text>
  <text start="663.82" dur="4.95">thousand vehicles this year down five</text>
  <text start="666.58" dur="5.22">percent from its earlier view down</text>
  <text start="668.77" dur="5.91">twenty-eight percent from 2015&amp;#39;s actual</text>
  <text start="671.8" dur="9.14">volume so what does this all mean orders</text>
  <text start="674.68" dur="9.75">are down and sales will follow sharply</text>
  <text start="680.94" dur="5.71">this does not look good it is getting</text>
  <text start="684.43" dur="4.56">worse and worse as we move throughout</text>
  <text start="686.65" dur="4.43">this year the Baltic Dry Index has</text>
  <text start="688.99" dur="5.82">dropped another 11 points it is down to</text>
  <text start="691.08" dur="5.59">631 now another indicator to let us know</text>
  <text start="694.81" dur="3.33">that the economy is not doing well is</text>

  <text start="703.33" dur="3.9">slowing economy that have recently</text>
  <text start="704.83" dur="5.37">emerged and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="707.23" dur="6.84">is that corporate tax receipts are once</text>
  <text start="710.2" dur="6.48">again declining and we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
