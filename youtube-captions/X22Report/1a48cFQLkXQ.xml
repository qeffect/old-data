  <text start="143.87" dur="5.79">more of these retailers completely break</text>
  <text start="147.769" dur="4.651">down and completely go out of business</text>

  <text start="159.98" dur="5.069">out there that completely do not exist</text>
  <text start="161.63" dur="4.889">today and what we&amp;#39;re seeing now is the</text>
  <text start="165.049" dur="3.541">corporate media is trying to make sense</text>
  <text start="166.519" dur="3.901">of this they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out how</text>
  <text start="168.59" dur="3.959">can we spin this in a way where it</text>
  <text start="170.42" dur="4.71">doesn&amp;#39;t sound that bad but it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="172.549" dur="4.921">getting bad right now and we already see</text>
  <text start="175.13" dur="4.74">that Amazon is continually out there</text>
  <text start="177.47" dur="4.08">saying they&amp;#39;re gonna be adding 30,000 or</text>
  <text start="179.87" dur="3.72">50,000 jobs but these are</text>
  <text start="181.55" dur="3.57">part-time jobs and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="183.59" dur="4.31">interesting is the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="185.12" dur="5.55">out there and they&amp;#39;re explaining away</text>
  <text start="187.9" dur="5.74">the part-time jobs are explaining away</text>
  <text start="190.67" dur="5.64">the full-time jobs and they come to a</text>
  <text start="193.64" dur="6.33">point where they knew it they need to</text>
  <text start="196.31" dur="5.49">explain what is happening here so they</text>
  <text start="199.97" dur="3.63">start off with you know Amazon&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="201.8" dur="4.92">creating incredible number of jobs</text>
  <text start="203.6" dur="6.15">30,000 jobs but their part-time and then</text>
  <text start="206.72" dur="5.67">they filled it in we&amp;#39;re around 5.6</text>
  <text start="209.75" dur="4.83">million Americans well they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="212.39" dur="4.17">part-time work and they&amp;#39;re desperate to</text>
  <text start="214.58" dur="3.96">find full-time work now this number is</text>
  <text start="216.56" dur="5.46">quite low they&amp;#39;re taking us from the BLS</text>
  <text start="218.54" dur="5.07">and what we know is there are so many</text>
  <text start="222.02" dur="4.64">people hundreds of millions of people</text>
  <text start="223.61" dur="8.52">that have completely fallen off the</text>
  <text start="226.66" dur="7.15">labor system where they&amp;#39;re not counted</text>
  <text start="232.13" dur="3.84">anymore because they haven&amp;#39;t gone on an</text>
  <text start="233.81" dur="4.98">interview in four weeks but these</text>
  <text start="235.97" dur="5.43">individuals they are looking for work</text>
  <text start="238.79" dur="3.93">now other individuals who had to take a</text>
  <text start="241.4" dur="3.45">part-time job because they couldn&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="242.72" dur="4.739">a full-time job they are looking for</text>
  <text start="244.85" dur="4.41">work but it&amp;#39;s all starting come it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="247.459" dur="4.831">starting to come to a head where they</text>
  <text start="249.26" dur="4.35">need to explain why this is happening of</text>
  <text start="252.29" dur="3.36">course they&amp;#39;re still using the excuse</text>
  <text start="253.61" dur="4.53">that there&amp;#39;s bad weather they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="255.65" dur="4.709">using the excuse that it&amp;#39;s online sales</text>
  <text start="258.14" dur="4.68">but we&amp;#39;ve debunked all of this this</text>
  <text start="260.359" dur="4.891">makes no sense whatsoever in this</text>
  <text start="262.82" dur="5.19">economy now we&amp;#39;re starting to see that</text>
  <text start="265.25" dur="5.37">people they are using their credit card</text>
  <text start="268.01" dur="4.92">more and more at this point now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="270.62" dur="4.23">seen this back in two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="272.93" dur="3.51">when things started to go south all of a</text>
  <text start="274.85" dur="2.97">sudden people went out there and they</text>
  <text start="276.44" dur="3.24">started to use their credit card because</text>
  <text start="277.82" dur="4.14">people lost their jobs and they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="279.68" dur="5.55">have the funds we see right now that</text>
  <text start="281.96" dur="6.6">total revolving credit it rose by 2.9</text>
  <text start="285.23" dur="5.31">billion undoing last month&amp;#39;s of a 2.6</text>
  <text start="288.56" dur="4.38">billion drop so things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="290.54" dur="4.92">changing and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that</text>
  <text start="292.94" dur="5.16">hope well it&amp;#39;s starting to disappear</text>
  <text start="295.46" dur="6">right now and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="298.1" dur="6.33">now is that student loan debt will that</text>
  <text start="301.46" dur="6.68">hit a trillion we know the auto loan</text>
  <text start="304.43" dur="7.859">industry that is hit over a trillion now</text>
  <text start="308.14" dur="6.279">non revolving debt for the first time</text>
  <text start="312.289" dur="2.971">since january of two thousand seven</text>
  <text start="314.419" dur="4.891">eight</text>
  <text start="315.26" dur="7.56">hit a trillion dollars we are in big</text>
  <text start="319.31" dur="5.37">trouble here not just with the economy</text>
  <text start="322.82" dur="4.67">but with what&amp;#39;s happening in the world</text>
  <text start="324.68" dur="6.39">remember all of this is tied together</text>
  <text start="327.49" dur="5.62">the petro dollar system the oil in the</text>
  <text start="331.07" dur="4.31">Middle East and everything here in the</text>
  <text start="333.11" dur="5.73">United States and globally the debt</text>
  <text start="335.38" dur="5.5">everything is intertwined and we could</text>
  <text start="338.84" dur="5.13">see that things are rapidly breaking</text>
  <text start="340.88" dur="6.03">apart now the IMF they came out with a</text>
  <text start="343.97" dur="5.49">working paper on eliminating cash now</text>
  <text start="346.91" dur="4.41">this is almost like the beylin documents</text>
  <text start="349.46" dur="4.23">where they set up the bail on documents</text>
  <text start="351.32" dur="3.81">in 2012 it was between the FDIC in the</text>
  <text start="353.69" dur="3.54">Bank of England and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="355.13" dur="4.38">we had that Cyprus incident which was a</text>
  <text start="357.23" dur="4.92">test case and then it spread throughout</text>
  <text start="359.51" dur="5.04">Europe into Canada into New Zealand and</text>
  <text start="362.15" dur="4.98">many other countries and now we have the</text>
  <text start="364.55" dur="7.5">IMF coming out and they published a</text>
  <text start="367.13" dur="7.83">working paper on d Cashin yes d caching</text>
  <text start="372.05" dur="5.94">and the paper clearly demonstrates that</text>
  <text start="374.96" dur="6.51">this is the direction we are headed into</text>
  <text start="377.99" dur="5.67">and it provides advice to governments</text>
  <text start="381.47" dur="4.98">who want to join in the latest thing</text>
  <text start="383.66" dur="5.58">which is abolishing cash now although</text>
  <text start="386.45" dur="4.71">some countries most likely will d cash</text>
  <text start="389.24" dur="4.56">in a few years going completely</text>
  <text start="391.16" dur="5.64">counselor should be phased in with</text>
  <text start="393.8" dur="5.07">certain steps the d cash in process</text>
  <text start="396.8" dur="4.41">could build on the initial and largely</text>
  <text start="398.87" dur="4.98">uncontested steps such as phasing out</text>
  <text start="401.21" dur="5.04">large denomination bills the placement</text>
  <text start="403.85" dur="4.47">of ceilings on cash transactions and the</text>
  <text start="406.25" dur="4.65">reporting of cash moves across the</text>
  <text start="408.32" dur="4.41">borders further steps could include</text>
  <text start="410.9" dur="4.31">creating economic incentives to reduce</text>
  <text start="412.73" dur="5.49">the use of cash in transactions</text>
  <text start="415.21" dur="4.93">simplifying the opening and use of</text>
  <text start="418.22" dur="4.92">transferable deposits and further</text>
  <text start="420.14" dur="5.91">computerizing the financial system so we</text>
  <text start="423.14" dur="5.07">are already on our way now all of that</text>
  <text start="426.05" dur="5.37">information that we received before</text>
  <text start="428.21" dur="7.56">about India which was a test case about</text>
  <text start="431.42" dur="7.92">removing cash the idea of removing the</text>
  <text start="435.77" dur="6.09">500 euro the idea of removing the</text>
  <text start="439.34" dur="5.91">100-dollar bill well here we are already</text>
  <text start="441.86" dur="6.51">there&amp;#39;s a working paper instructing the</text>
  <text start="445.25" dur="7.05">government&amp;#39;s on how to be cash</text>
  <text start="448.37" dur="6.06">why because at this point they want them</text>
  <text start="452.3" dur="4.77">to follow this because we are moving</text>
  <text start="454.43" dur="5.61">into that collapse scenario no like I</text>
  <text start="457.07" dur="6">said everything is connected and things</text>
  <text start="460.04" dur="5.76">can change in a snap of a finger and we</text>
  <text start="463.07" dur="5.64">are seeing this today one minute</text>

  <text start="474.32" dur="4.23">even going to be getting involved in the</text>
  <text start="475.76" dur="5.67">Middle East and here we are today things</text>
  <text start="478.55" dur="6.239">have rapidly changed and it was in a</text>
  <text start="481.43" dur="6.12">split second this happen and we know</text>
  <text start="484.789" dur="5.671">moving forward things are going to</text>
  <text start="487.55" dur="5.91">rapidly change and this is why everyone</text>
  <text start="490.46" dur="5.31">today needs to get prepared for what is</text>

  <text start="545.45" dur="4.8">it gives you the fat it gives you the</text>
  <text start="547.279" dur="5.521">protein because when things start to</text>
  <text start="550.25" dur="5.31">fall apart it&amp;#39;s going to be very very</text>
  <text start="552.8" dur="4.17">difficult to get food and a lot of</text>
  <text start="555.56" dur="3.69">people are going to be running to the</text>
  <text start="556.97" dur="4.86">market to get food and you don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="559.25" dur="4.68">get caught up in that and also we&amp;#39;re</text>
