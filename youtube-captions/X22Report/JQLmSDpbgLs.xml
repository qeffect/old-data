  <text start="328.6" dur="4.51">everything that&amp;#39;s been pumped up well</text>
  <text start="331.52" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s all starting to fall apart</text>

  <text start="824.939" dur="3.821">don&amp;#39;t they accept their paper currency</text>
  <text start="827.22" dur="4.15">for the gold think about it</text>
  <text start="828.76" dur="5.63">for a second they don&amp;#39;t want to give it</text>
  <text start="831.37" dur="5.22">up Italy wants it back</text>
  <text start="834.39" dur="5.41">countries are beginning to say you know</text>
  <text start="836.59" dur="6.6">something the people should hold on to</text>
  <text start="839.8" dur="6.27">their gold not the central banks this is</text>
  <text start="843.19" dur="5.28">just the beginning and we can see</text>
  <text start="846.07" dur="4.95">everything is starting to move into</text>
  <text start="848.47" dur="6.3">position and we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot more</text>
  <text start="851.02" dur="7.41">countries do what Italy is doing right</text>
  <text start="854.77" dur="6.18">now and countries are going to start to</text>

  <text start="860.95" dur="5.52">people need to hold the gold this is why</text>
  <text start="863.68" dur="4.43">Germany wanted their goal back this is</text>
  <text start="866.47" dur="5.76">why Venezuela wanted there go back from</text>
  <text start="868.11" dur="5.95">the UK this is why China and Russia have</text>
  <text start="872.23" dur="4.02">been purchasing a lot of gold that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="874.06" dur="8.1">India has been purchasing a lot of gold</text>

  <text start="891.55" dur="5.15">in full control of what the Fed does</text>
  <text start="893.86" dur="6.18">right now and I think moving forward</text>
  <text start="896.7" dur="6.13">we&amp;#39;re going to see more of this play out</text>
  <text start="900.04" dur="4.77">and it&amp;#39;s going to accelerate as we move</text>
  <text start="902.83" dur="4.23">towards 2020 and right after the</text>
  <text start="904.81" dur="3.93">elections when Trump wins again you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="907.06" dur="4.08">gonna see things move like you&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="908.74" dur="4.8">seen before and Trump will be making</text>
  <text start="911.14" dur="4.8">announcements that you would never</text>
  <text start="913.54" dur="5.04">believe that he was making that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="915.94" dur="5.04">going back on a gold standard that the</text>
  <text start="918.58" dur="5.07">central bank is a criminal entity that</text>
  <text start="920.98" dur="4.97">it needs to be audited and of course how</text>
  <text start="923.65" dur="4.47">is he going to do this with a crisis</text>
  <text start="925.95" dur="4.18">because this way he&amp;#39;ll be able to point</text>
  <text start="928.12" dur="4.35">the finger at the Fed this is why he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="930.13" dur="7.2">been contradicting the Fed this entire</text>
  <text start="932.47" dur="5.16">time calling the Fed out so people hear</text>
  <text start="937.33" dur="2.79">it</text>
  <text start="937.63" dur="5.7">so people wake up and understand that it</text>
  <text start="940.12" dur="5.93">is the Fed that is the problem they</text>
  <text start="943.33" dur="5.28">raise rates the market comes down</text>
  <text start="946.05" dur="5.44">they just keep rates steady it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="948.61" dur="5.82">good enough they need to lower it think</text>
  <text start="951.49" dur="4.8">about it for a second and he can show</text>
  <text start="954.43" dur="4.05">that they really don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="956.29" dur="5.07">doing because they said the economy is</text>
  <text start="958.48" dur="4.22">improving these are the best statistical</text>
  <text start="961.36" dur="4.46">numbers that we&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="962.7" dur="6.47">but yet they&amp;#39;re backing off on raising</text>
  <text start="965.82" dur="6.6">the rates they&amp;#39;re discontinuing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="969.17" dur="5.5">tightening something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
