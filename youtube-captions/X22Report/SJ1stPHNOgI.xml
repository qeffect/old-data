  <text start="151.05" dur="4.13">the actors case was handled but it</text>
  <text start="154.29" dur="3.96">didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="155.18" dur="6.49">the special prosecutor said you know</text>

  <text start="162.92" dur="3.99">is going to look into this we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="164.75" dur="8.31">to get to the bottom of what happened</text>
  <text start="166.91" dur="8.159">here whether any laws broken and we can</text>
  <text start="173.06" dur="5.13">see that everything is moving forward</text>
  <text start="175.069" dur="6.331">with Jesse Smollett now we know that</text>
  <text start="178.19" dur="6.299">Trump doesn&amp;#39;t tweet or say something</text>
  <text start="181.4" dur="5.309">unless he has facts to back it up</text>
  <text start="184.489" dur="4.861">now in the beginning stages when he</text>
  <text start="186.709" dur="6.241">comes out with something people say ho</text>
  <text start="189.35" dur="5.85">he has unsupported evidence he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="192.95" dur="4.5">out there saying things and he has</text>
  <text start="195.2" dur="5.009">nothing to back it up and then later on</text>
  <text start="197.45" dur="5.91">as more and more information comes out</text>
  <text start="200.209" dur="4.651">you find out that he does have the facts</text>
  <text start="203.36" dur="3.18">now of course the mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="204.86" dur="3.959">going to be out there saying that he has</text>
  <text start="206.54" dur="4.529">nothing to make it seem like he&amp;#39;s crazy</text>
  <text start="208.819" dur="5.971">he&amp;#39;s just out there spewing the stuff</text>
  <text start="211.069" dur="7.5">out there but he always has the facts</text>
  <text start="214.79" dur="7.14">the truth the evidence to support what</text>
  <text start="218.569" dur="5.101">he&amp;#39;s saying and there&amp;#39;s a reason why he</text>
  <text start="221.93" dur="3.69">points out certain things like Baltimore</text>
  <text start="223.67" dur="4.68">San Francisco Elijah Cummings these are</text>
  <text start="225.62" dur="5.55">all the same exact players that are</text>
  <text start="228.35" dur="4.199">going to be taking down and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="231.17" dur="5.76">interesting is that representative</text>
  <text start="232.549" dur="6.481">Elijah Cummings he declined an offer to</text>
  <text start="236.93" dur="4.26">tour a Baltimore Housing and Urban</text>
  <text start="239.03" dur="5.64">Development HUD facility with HUD</text>
  <text start="241.19" dur="7.049">secretary ben Carson on Wednesday now</text>
  <text start="244.67" dur="6.18">why did he decline because if he was</text>
  <text start="248.239" dur="5.491">there he they would see that</text>
  <text start="250.85" dur="5.699">everything&amp;#39;s rundown it&amp;#39;s rat infested</text>
  <text start="253.73" dur="8.73">and people would ask him questions and</text>
  <text start="256.549" dur="8.191">he already knew that Baltimore was a</text>
  <text start="262.46" dur="5.72">drug infested rat infested and they had</text>
  <text start="264.74" dur="8.52">lots of problems if we go back to 1999</text>
  <text start="268.18" dur="7.39">he actually said this take a listen sure</text>
  <text start="273.26" dur="4.219">that you are well aware that I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="275.57" dur="6.45">strong advocate of sound</text>
  <text start="277.479" dur="7.241">counter-narcotics efforts and I will say</text>
  <text start="282.02" dur="5.76">it every single time I have an</text>
  <text start="284.72" dur="8.24">opportunity sometimes I really just</text>
  <text start="287.78" dur="7.949">think we don&amp;#39;t get it this morning I</text>
  <text start="292.96" dur="3.769">left my community of Baltimore a</text>
  <text start="295.729" dur="4.24">drug-infested</text>
  <text start="296.729" dur="7.05">area where a lot of the drugs that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="299.969" dur="6.45">talking about today have already taken</text>
  <text start="303.779" dur="5.401">the lives of so many children and the</text>
  <text start="306.419" dur="4.89">situation in Baltimore did not improve</text>
  <text start="309.18" dur="3.209">since then it has gotten worse and worse</text>
  <text start="311.309" dur="5.04">and worse and people are asking</text>
  <text start="312.389" dur="6.78">questions where is the money all this</text>
  <text start="316.349" dur="6.09">money that is headed down to Baltimore</text>
  <text start="319.169" dur="6.87">where is a gun now of course we know</text>
  <text start="322.439" dur="6.48">that Baltimore Elijah Cummings they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="326.039" dur="6.171">been receiving a lot of money and Trump</text>
  <text start="328.919" dur="7.101">is pointing this out he&amp;#39;s exposing</text>
  <text start="332.21" dur="8.139">making people ask questions and remember</text>
  <text start="336.02" dur="6.519">the deep state players they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="340.349" dur="4.861">this exposed they don&amp;#39;t want people</text>
  <text start="342.539" dur="5.34">asking questions this is supposed to be</text>
  <text start="345.21" dur="4.859">behind the scenes they&amp;#39;re not supposed</text>
  <text start="347.879" dur="5.25">to know that the money is being siphoned</text>
  <text start="350.069" dur="5.4">off and you know used for other things</text>
  <text start="353.129" dur="4.5">like people putting it in their pockets</text>
  <text start="355.469" dur="4.141">giving it to friends just like when</text>
  <text start="357.629" dur="4.08">Trump mentioned Puerto Rico how many</text>
  <text start="359.61" dur="4.739">people have been arrests or ready how</text>
  <text start="361.709" dur="5.341">many at the governor resigned everyone</text>
  <text start="364.349" dur="6.331">said he was crazy and now we find out</text>
  <text start="367.05" dur="8.039">that yes the money was not going to help</text>
  <text start="370.68" dur="6.69">the people its corruption that&amp;#39;s what it</text>
  <text start="375.089" dur="6.81">is these people are crooks</text>
  <text start="377.37" dur="8.25">now IG Horowitz he&amp;#39;s been investigating</text>
  <text start="381.899" dur="7.86">auditing where all this money has gone</text>
  <text start="385.62" dur="6.089">and they give money they come back and</text>
  <text start="389.759" dur="4.74">they say okay where is this money why</text>
  <text start="391.709" dur="4.83">isn&amp;#39;t it being used to help build this</text>
  <text start="394.499" dur="7.051">or do this or help with crime or</text>
  <text start="396.539" dur="9.36">anything like this now the whole purpose</text>
  <text start="401.55" dur="7.759">of Trump pointing out Baltimore is I do</text>
  <text start="405.899" dur="8.19">believe that this was a sting operation</text>
  <text start="409.309" dur="6.541">because Trump gave Baltimore a lot of</text>
  <text start="414.089" dur="5.571">money</text>
  <text start="415.85" dur="7.47">a lot of money went into the system now</text>
  <text start="419.66" dur="6.47">it&amp;#39;s all gone Horowitz has been looking</text>
  <text start="423.32" dur="5.01">into this because they do audits I</text>
  <text start="426.13" dur="5.22">believe that this was a setup</text>
  <text start="428.33" dur="6.38">and Jo M at storing his storm is upon us</text>
  <text start="431.35" dur="6.61">kind of sums it all up with one tweet</text>
  <text start="434.71" dur="6.04">the whole Baltimore scandal was a sting</text>
  <text start="437.96" dur="5.28">Trump gave 16 billion to revive the</text>
  <text start="440.75" dur="5.55">slums and crooked Democrats stole it all</text>
  <text start="443.24" dur="5.31">we knew they would and Horowitz watch</text>
  <text start="446.3" dur="5.61">the whole thing play out while taking</text>
  <text start="448.55" dur="6.56">notes now we have them and are coming to</text>
  <text start="451.91" dur="7.62">collect and think about this think about</text>
  <text start="455.11" dur="7.87">what is happening here all of this has</text>
  <text start="459.53" dur="5.55">been behind the curtains no one sees it</text>
  <text start="462.98" dur="4.62">every time someone mentions it the</text>
  <text start="465.08" dur="5.1">mainstream media protects these</text>
  <text start="467.6" dur="4.31">individuals these individuals and their</text>
  <text start="470.18" dur="5.16">friends say this is not happening</text>
  <text start="471.91" dur="7.44">don&amp;#39;t worry about it and everyone says</text>
  <text start="475.34" dur="7.23">okay it&amp;#39;s not happening Trump now is</text>
  <text start="479.35" dur="5.89">exposing all of this and this is why</text>
  <text start="482.57" dur="5.76">these people are screaming and yelling</text>
  <text start="485.24" dur="7.44">they&amp;#39;re panicking because the curtain is</text>
  <text start="488.33" dur="9.06">being drawn back and the people are now</text>
  <text start="492.68" dur="7.71">being shown what is happening and this</text>
  <text start="497.39" dur="5.85">is not just happening with states within</text>
  <text start="500.39" dur="5.43">and cities within the United States</text>
  <text start="503.24" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;re talking about the Red Cross we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="505.82" dur="5.64">talking about Planned Parenthood we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="507.71" dur="7.83">talking about all of these systems where</text>
  <text start="511.46" dur="7.83">they&amp;#39;re taking the funds and diverting</text>
  <text start="515.54" dur="5.37">it into different areas and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="519.29" dur="5.46">areas that people think it&amp;#39;s their</text>
  <text start="520.91" dur="6.21">pockets it&amp;#39;s to help other friends it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="524.75" dur="5.88">not to help the cause that it was</text>
  <text start="527.12" dur="5.73">originally laid out for and Trump has</text>
  <text start="530.63" dur="4.89">just pulled back the curtain and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="532.85" dur="5.85">showing everyone what is really going on</text>
  <text start="535.52" dur="6.3">here now we know that Dan Coates he is</text>
  <text start="538.7" dur="6.69">out and Trump mentioned that oh we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="541.82" dur="6.49">gonna nominate Radcliffe now will</text>
  <text start="545.39" dur="4.48">Radcliffe get the position we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="548.31" dur="5.37">but we can see how the deep state</text>
  <text start="549.87" dur="5.52">players they are panicking they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="553.68" dur="3.66">want anyone else in there that they</text>
  <text start="555.39" dur="4.62">can&amp;#39;t control that&amp;#39;s not on their side</text>
  <text start="557.34" dur="6.03">that actually is going to do the work</text>
  <text start="560.01" dur="5.85">Diane Feinstein now this is very</text>
  <text start="563.37" dur="5.49">interesting with Diane Feinstein she</text>
  <text start="565.86" dur="5.4">lashed out at Radcliffe and said he</text>
  <text start="568.86" dur="5.55">appears to lack the experience needed</text>
  <text start="571.26" dur="5.1">for the job she said by law this</text>
  <text start="574.41" dur="4.95">position requires extensive national</text>
  <text start="576.36" dur="4.65">security expertise congressman Radcliffe</text>
  <text start="579.36" dur="5.51">appears to lack the experience needed</text>
  <text start="581.01" dur="7.86">for the job really Dianne Feinstein</text>
  <text start="584.87" dur="6.76">let&amp;#39;s go back a little bit remember when</text>
  <text start="588.87" dur="5.7">she was the ranking member of the Senate</text>
  <text start="591.63" dur="6.84">Judiciary Committee also served on the</text>
  <text start="594.57" dur="7.05">Senate Intelligence panel but yet she</text>
  <text start="598.47" dur="6.15">was caught with a Chinese spy on her</text>
  <text start="601.62" dur="8.25">payroll a man she had employed and paid</text>
  <text start="604.62" dur="7.83">for over 20 years she reportedly found</text>
  <text start="609.87" dur="5.43">out that her staffer was a Chinese spy</text>
  <text start="612.45" dur="5.91">in 2013 while she was the chairman of</text>
  <text start="615.3" dur="6.24">the Senate Intelligence Committee and</text>
  <text start="618.36" dur="5.45">the Chinese spy mysteriously appeared on</text>
  <text start="621.54" dur="4.56">the scene in 1993 just one year after</text>
  <text start="623.81" dur="6.82">Feinstein was elected to the Senate in</text>
  <text start="626.1" dur="7.38">92 is this a coincidence no guess what</text>
  <text start="630.63" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re panicking and if you go along</text>
  <text start="633.48" dur="4.02">with her narrative that Ratcliffe</text>
  <text start="635.73" dur="4.56">doesn&amp;#39;t know what she&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="637.5" dur="5.1">and you go back to when she had this</text>
  <text start="640.29" dur="4.35">Chinese spy and we know that she placed</text>
  <text start="642.6" dur="5.28">them this person in there she knew about</text>
  <text start="644.64" dur="7.44">it she&amp;#39;s pretending she didn&amp;#39;t well did</text>
  <text start="647.88" dur="8.07">she have the experience no what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="652.08" dur="5.49">really afraid of is that anyone that</text>
  <text start="655.95" dur="2.759">Trump nominates doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="657.57" dur="4.41">Radcliffe for anyone else in him</text>
  <text start="658.709" dur="5.941">Radcliffe might just be a distraction</text>
  <text start="661.98" dur="4.979">while Trump brings in the real person he</text>
  <text start="664.65" dur="4.26">wants let them make a really big deal</text>
  <text start="666.959" dur="6.361">over this and then bring in the person</text>
  <text start="668.91" dur="7.85">he really wants they&amp;#39;re afraid that this</text>
  <text start="673.32" dur="5.55">person is going to actually do the job</text>
  <text start="676.76" dur="4.81">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re afraid of</text>
  <text start="678.87" dur="6.96">they&amp;#39;re this person will no longer be</text>
  <text start="681.57" dur="8.42">on their side protecting them that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="685.83" dur="7.61">they&amp;#39;re panicking because all the blocks</text>
  <text start="689.99" dur="6.28">everything that they had in place is now</text>
  <text start="693.44" dur="5.02">removed now yesterday we talked about</text>
  <text start="696.27" dur="4.97">how a federal judge dismissed the DNC</text>
  <text start="698.46" dur="7.08">lawsuit against Trump and his campaign</text>
  <text start="701.24" dur="6.51">about Russia Russia and WikiLeaks and we</text>
  <text start="705.54" dur="6.39">know that their entire case the entire</text>
  <text start="707.75" dur="7.57">deep state narrative was based on Russia</text>
  <text start="711.93" dur="6.21">it is now falling apart Trump tweeted</text>
  <text start="715.32" dur="3.9">out the following Wow a federal judge in</text>

  <text start="1649.38" dur="5.25">earth will be bombarded by a solar storm</text>
  <text start="1652.08" dur="4.8">and nobody is quite sure yet how bad it</text>
  <text start="1654.63" dur="3.96">will be if the storm is relatively minor</text>
  <text start="1656.88" dur="3.57">we could just experience a few</text>
  <text start="1658.59" dur="4.41">disruptions to satellite communications</text>
  <text start="1660.45" dur="5.79">and see some pretty lights in the sky</text>

  <text start="1691.47" dur="3.93">that the deep state likes to use</text>
  <text start="1693.3" dur="4.62">shooting events will this be big enough</text>
  <text start="1695.4" dur="5.16">to clog the new cycle because that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1697.92" dur="7.35">whole purpose of this it&amp;#39;s to clog the</text>

  <text start="1778.57" dur="5.55">everything shut down for quite a while</text>
  <text start="1781.24" dur="4.65">and make the mainstream media the only</text>
