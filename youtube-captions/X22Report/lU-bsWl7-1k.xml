  <text start="32.84" dur="6.659">today&amp;#39;s date is october second 2013 and</text>
  <text start="36.35" dur="5.129">the title of this episode is the dark of</text>
  <text start="39.499" dur="5.25">night gives cover to prepare for the</text>
  <text start="41.479" dur="5.43">next false flag and we&amp;#39;re going to get</text>
  <text start="44.749" dur="4.461">right into the economic collapse news</text>
  <text start="46.909" dur="6.63">because i have a lot to cover today and</text>
  <text start="49.21" dur="7.329">we&amp;#39;re going to go with the job numbers</text>
  <text start="53.539" dur="4.32">the BSA the BLS numbers really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="56.539" dur="4.23">come in so they&amp;#39;re taking the numbers</text>
  <text start="57.859" dur="4.32">from ATP and as we can expect everyone</text>
  <text start="60.769" dur="3.631">saying oh look they&amp;#39;re better than</text>
  <text start="62.179" dur="4.521">normal you know but there&amp;#39;s no real</text>
  <text start="64.4" dur="5.79">government official numbers out there</text>
  <text start="66.7" dur="6">but one thing is interesting with all of</text>
  <text start="70.19" dur="7.8">these jobs that they&amp;#39;re creating and</text>
  <text start="72.7" dur="7.96">unemployment going down the vacancy rate</text>
  <text start="77.99" dur="8.1">of office buildings should be a lot</text>
  <text start="80.66" dur="9.36">lower and back in 2010 and the first</text>
  <text start="86.09" dur="7.55">quarter of 2011 office vacancies has</text>
  <text start="90.02" dur="7.83">seven seventeen point six percent today</text>
  <text start="93.64" dur="7.33">they&amp;#39;re at sixteen point nine percent so</text>
  <text start="97.85" dur="5.52">if we look at all of these jobs that</text>
  <text start="100.97" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re creating where are they creating</text>
  <text start="103.37" dur="4.97">them well they&amp;#39;re not going back into</text>
  <text start="105.08" dur="7.38">the offices because at the height it was</text>
  <text start="108.34" dur="8.05">17.6 and what is it three years later</text>
  <text start="112.46" dur="8.1">now it&amp;#39;s at sixteen point now 16.9 so we</text>
  <text start="116.39" dur="6.18">can see the the actual statistics of</text>
  <text start="120.56" dur="5.93">jobs being created in the service sector</text>
  <text start="122.57" dur="7.98">or quite true that when merck and</text>
  <text start="126.49" dur="7.9">toshiba Wells Fargo Bank of America</text>
  <text start="130.55" dur="8.609">Citibank Siemens all lay off employees</text>
  <text start="134.39" dur="6.19">that have office jobs there&amp;#39;s none being</text>
  <text start="139.159" dur="5.441">replaced</text>
  <text start="140.58" dur="6.15">any smaller companies those offices are</text>
  <text start="144.6" dur="7.14">staying vacant and this is why this</text>
  <text start="146.73" dur="10.02">number has not really reduced any and we</text>
  <text start="151.74" dur="7.94">can see that the numbers the government</text>
  <text start="156.75" dur="8.16">has been giving us are completely</text>
  <text start="159.68" dur="9.1">manipulated and fake and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="164.91" dur="6.18">seeing also now that the mainstream</text>
  <text start="168.78" dur="5.85">media this is out of Reuters is saying</text>
  <text start="171.09" dur="7.35">that the US mortgage applications dipped</text>

  <text start="178.44" dur="9.63">have fallen um just this past week they</text>
  <text start="182.28" dur="9.87">fall in about 0.4% and we saw if we look</text>

  <text start="192.15" dur="5.34">saw mortgage applications starting to</text>
  <text start="194.94" dur="4.769">plunge we didn&amp;#39;t see sales plunging at</text>

  <text start="202.47" dur="5.97">campaigning of real estate is getting</text>
  <text start="205.14" dur="5.97">better but now we see that the</text>
  <text start="208.44" dur="5.64">mainstream corporate media is now saying</text>
  <text start="211.11" dur="5.34">that mortgage applications are starting</text>

  <text start="243.57" dur="6.27">been seeing these problems and this</text>
  <text start="246.48" dur="6.15">could be a setup for some type of false</text>
  <text start="249.84" dur="8.07">flag cyberattack down the line where</text>
  <text start="252.63" dur="7.56">they&amp;#39;re putting something or inserting</text>
  <text start="257.91" dur="4.02">something into the system and since</text>
  <text start="260.19" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;ve done this we&amp;#39;re seeing these</text>
  <text start="261.93" dur="5.549">glitches and we have to remember back</text>
  <text start="263.88" dur="6.599">that we saw many many glitches in the</text>

  <text start="282.58" dur="5.04">government is shut down but not</text>
  <text start="285.039" dur="4.59">everything is shut down and what the</text>
  <text start="287.62" dur="5.099">government officials are trying to do is</text>
  <text start="289.629" dur="5.581">they&amp;#39;re trying to say to America look</text>
  <text start="292.719" dur="4.531">look what you&amp;#39;ve done Congress is not</text>

  <text start="303.46" dur="7.35">museums but the things that aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="307.33" dur="5.76">closed well I should say they did reduce</text>
  <text start="310.81" dur="5.4">the number of people in the IRS and</text>
  <text start="313.09" dur="4.77">that&amp;#39;s about they reduced it by 91% but</text>
  <text start="316.21" dur="4.049">that&amp;#39;s not a bad thing I don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="317.86" dur="5.13">care if the whole IRS is furloughed let</text>

  <text start="355.69" dur="6.719">going strong they&amp;#39;re still playing</text>
  <text start="357.3" dur="8.019">social security and everything else and</text>
  <text start="362.409" dur="6.54">the only things that they&amp;#39;ve really shut</text>
  <text start="365.319" dur="6.931">down the things that people actually see</text>
  <text start="368.949" dur="5.791">and right now it is a very small</text>
  <text start="372.25" dur="4.71">percentage of the government and we have</text>
  <text start="374.74" dur="4.829">to remember that the Treasury secretary</text>
  <text start="376.96" dur="5.549">Jack Lew he is taking the pension money</text>
  <text start="379.569" dur="8.041">right now to fund the government until</text>
  <text start="382.509" dur="7.47">October 17th now the bankers visited</text>
  <text start="387.61" dur="4.32">President Obama today saying that you</text>
  <text start="389.979" dur="3.601">know don&amp;#39;t mess with the debt ceilings</text>
  <text start="391.93" dur="6.979">and it looks like they&amp;#39;re getting a</text>
  <text start="393.58" dur="5.329">little nervous and they met with him and</text>
  <text start="399.12" dur="7.089">Lloyd blank and fine is saying that you</text>
  <text start="403.24" dur="4.44">know says he&amp;#39;s not anxious to be witness</text>
  <text start="406.209" dur="3.99">to a default</text>
  <text start="407.68" dur="5.31">economic damage of default would be</text>
  <text start="410.199" dur="4.921">severe there&amp;#39;s no debate on the</text>
  <text start="412.99" dur="4.95">seriousness of the u.s. not paying its</text>
  <text start="415.12" dur="4.95">debt and banks are in a position to</text>
  <text start="417.94" dur="5.19">really know early what the consequences</text>
  <text start="420.07" dur="7.17">are that if the government does default</text>
  <text start="423.13" dur="5.819">on their obligations this is something</text>
  <text start="427.24" dur="4.649">that you do not want because the whole</text>
  <text start="428.949" dur="6.421">economy would come tumbling down and</text>
  <text start="431.889" dur="7.081">they were meeting today and now Obama is</text>
  <text start="435.37" dur="8.16">prepared to negotiate he had an</text>
  <text start="438.97" dur="6.78">interview and he says this time that he</text>
  <text start="443.53" dur="5.21">is ready he&amp;#39;ll sit down with the people</text>
  <text start="445.75" dur="6.02">and we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this plays out</text>
  <text start="448.74" dur="6.37">now Obama is out there saying that</text>
  <text start="451.77" dur="6.64">Obamacare exchanges it&amp;#39;s a huge success</text>
  <text start="455.11" dur="7.5">but when you look at it over fifty</text>
  <text start="458.41" dur="6.599">percent fail rate when people went to go</text>
  <text start="462.61" dur="4.5">sign up or just get on the site there</text>
  <text start="465.009" dur="6.151">were tons of errors people couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="467.11" dur="6.57">apply things didn&amp;#39;t work and CNN went</text>
  <text start="471.16" dur="6.6">out there and they went out and they</text>
  <text start="473.68" dur="7.2">tried in 20 different states and 12 of</text>
  <text start="477.76" dur="5.49">them were hit with some type of glitch</text>
  <text start="480.88" dur="7.68">when they tried to do anything so in</text>
  <text start="483.25" dur="7.86">reality this was not a huge success at</text>
  <text start="488.56" dur="6.63">all this software was not ready to go</text>
  <text start="491.11" dur="7.98">live and again we can see by this this</text>
  <text start="495.19" dur="8.13">was not shut down as the government shut</text>
  <text start="499.09" dur="7.109">down this was kept on and people were</text>
  <text start="503.32" dur="7.469">able to do it because Obama didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="506.199" dur="7.741">anything to interrupt this health</text>
  <text start="510.789" dur="4.981">insurance exchange system from going</text>
  <text start="513.94" dur="3.479">live and he wanted it completely to go</text>
  <text start="515.77" dur="3.809">life he didn&amp;#39;t care how many glitches</text>
  <text start="517.419" dur="4.41">there were he didn&amp;#39;t care if there were</text>
  <text start="519.579" dur="4.561">anything wrong and out of his</text>
  <text start="521.829" dur="4.801">organization they&amp;#39;re saying expect</text>
  <text start="524.14" dur="4.62">months of glitches because they just</text>
  <text start="526.63" dur="6.3">can&amp;#39;t get to everything so this was</text>
  <text start="528.76" dur="6.63">really not ready to go live at all now</text>
  <text start="532.93" dur="5.82">it&amp;#39;s staying with Obamacare here we can</text>
  <text start="535.39" dur="6.33">see what is happening major businesses</text>
  <text start="538.75" dur="7.889">are cutting</text>
  <text start="541.72" dur="7.349">the health insurance for spouses so if</text>
  <text start="546.639" dur="4.651">you worked in a company and you got</text>
  <text start="549.069" dur="4.38">health insurance you would have health</text>
  <text start="551.29" dur="5.159">insurance for the family but to save</text>
  <text start="553.449" dur="5.88">money or companies are doing are they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="556.449" dur="7.411">saying they&amp;#39;re saying that oh if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="559.329" dur="8.61">eligible for the exchanges your spouse</text>
  <text start="563.86" dur="6.63">can go ahead and pay to get health</text>
  <text start="567.939" dur="6.061">insurance and we&amp;#39;ll just support the</text>
  <text start="570.49" dur="6.149">employee so what&amp;#39;s happening is all the</text>
  <text start="574" dur="7.11">expenses are being moved on to the</text>
  <text start="576.639" dur="6.93">people and companies corporations are no</text>
  <text start="581.11" dur="5.61">longer having to shell this out so</text>
  <text start="583.569" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re having huge savings while the</text>
  <text start="586.72" dur="5.609">people are hitting are getting hit with</text>
  <text start="589.329" dur="5.041">new bills for health insurance and this</text>
  <text start="592.329" dur="4.471">goes on to say more and more employers</text>
  <text start="594.37" dur="4.139">are dropping spazz ille health insurance</text>
  <text start="596.8" dur="4.17">coverage in response to the extra</text>
  <text start="598.509" dur="4.77">burdens imposed by Obamacare these</text>
  <text start="600.97" dur="4.919">trends illustrate how increasing numbers</text>
  <text start="603.279" dur="5.43">of people will become dependent on the</text>
  <text start="605.889" dur="5.611">program&amp;#39;s federal health exchanges they</text>
  <text start="608.709" dur="4.891">they also clearly counter Obama&amp;#39;s now</text>
  <text start="611.5" dur="4.86">infamous claim that if you like your</text>
  <text start="613.6" dur="5.489">coverage you can keep it well you really</text>
  <text start="616.36" dur="4.68">can&amp;#39;t because if you work for a company</text>
  <text start="619.089" dur="5.821">and you have your wife and your children</text>
  <text start="621.04" dur="6.45">on the system they are telling you the</text>
  <text start="624.91" dur="4.83">businesses we want you off the system so</text>
  <text start="627.49" dur="7.05">you cannot keep your health insurance</text>
  <text start="629.74" dur="7.649">and for those people who are just tuning</text>
  <text start="634.54" dur="6.269">in here for the first time I have always</text>
  <text start="637.389" dur="6.541">said that Obamacare is not for the</text>
  <text start="640.809" dur="6.181">people if you are forced to take</text>
  <text start="643.93" dur="6.36">something that you really don&amp;#39;t want it</text>
  <text start="646.99" dur="5.969">is not for the people if you do not take</text>
  <text start="650.29" dur="4.589">it and you&amp;#39;re penalized it is definitely</text>
  <text start="652.959" dur="3.87">not for the people and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="654.879" dur="5.341">interesting is that the government</text>
  <text start="656.829" dur="6.211">officials are exempt from using</text>
  <text start="660.22" dur="6.39">Obamacare like senators the president</text>
  <text start="663.04" dur="6.419">and what it&amp;#39;s happening is that now</text>
  <text start="666.61" dur="5.069">people are penalized and businesses are</text>
  <text start="669.459" dur="4.171">also penalized if they do not take</text>
  <text start="671.679" dur="4.801">health insurance</text>
  <text start="673.63" dur="6.63">and what are the penalties well for the</text>
  <text start="676.48" dur="9.12">first year of 2014 each adult is taxed</text>
  <text start="680.26" dur="11.37">$95 or 1% of family income and this</text>
  <text start="685.6" dur="10.86">continually rises in 2015 each adult is</text>
  <text start="691.63" dur="8.04">taxed 325 dollars or two percent of the</text>
  <text start="696.46" dur="6.26">family income and which ever one is</text>
  <text start="699.67" dur="8.16">greater that&amp;#39;s the one they&amp;#39;re taken</text>
  <text start="702.72" dur="9.07">2016 and beyond 695 dollars per adult or</text>
  <text start="707.83" dur="7.59">two point five percent of the family</text>
  <text start="711.79" dur="8.73">income is taxed and penalized for not</text>
  <text start="715.42" dur="8.07">taking health insurance so you&amp;#39;re damned</text>

  <text start="723.49" dur="4.35">you&amp;#39;ll get their coverage but there are</text>
  <text start="725.44" dur="5.46">a lot of stipulations that go along with</text>
  <text start="727.84" dur="4.65">getting Obamacare coverage you have to</text>
  <text start="730.9" dur="4.59">allow people to come into your house</text>

  <text start="1560.86" dur="5.16">couple weeks ago when there were reports</text>
  <text start="1563.38" dur="5.46">out there saying that Assad was moving</text>
  <text start="1566.02" dur="7.92">chemical weapons into Lebanon and out of</text>

  <text start="1584.23" dur="4.199">moved out of the country before they</text>
  <text start="1585.85" dur="5.97">arrived because they never existed and</text>
  <text start="1588.429" dur="6.571">this is propaganda again trying to</text>
  <text start="1591.82" dur="5.34">convince everyone that Assad cannot be</text>

  <text start="1611.36" dur="9.87">u.s. vulnerable to cyberattacks and the</text>
  <text start="1617.27" dur="7.5">person who was speaking for this said if</text>
  <text start="1621.23" dur="5.85">a zero-day came out today it would be</text>
  <text start="1624.77" dur="5.13">hard for government to respond Bailey</text>
