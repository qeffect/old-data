  <text start="62.219" dur="5.311">Federal Reserve to expose it let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="65.28" dur="5.119">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="67.53" dur="5.699">news now yesterday we talked about how</text>
  <text start="70.399" dur="5.051">Italy&amp;#39;s youth unemployment was</text>
  <text start="73.229" dur="3.841">skyrocketing hitting something like</text>
  <text start="75.45" dur="3.36">forty percent or so and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="77.07" dur="2.999">this in Greece we&amp;#39;re seeing it in France</text>
  <text start="78.81" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;re seeing it in many different</text>
  <text start="80.069" dur="4.86">countries even doubt in Latin America I</text>
  <text start="82.5" dur="5.039">mean Brazil their unemployment well it</text>
  <text start="84.929" dur="5.631">hit is a record high and it hit about</text>
  <text start="87.539" dur="5.64">12.5 percent and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="90.56" dur="6.04">throughout the world right now is there</text>
  <text start="93.179" dur="6.181">so many people that are unemployed at</text>
  <text start="96.6" dur="4.199">this point even here in the United</text>
  <text start="99.36" dur="3.539">States even though we have the</text>
  <text start="100.799" dur="3.121">manipulated numbers and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="102.899" dur="3.78">to convince us that the unemployment</text>
  <text start="103.92" dur="4.979">rate is four point seven percent we know</text>
  <text start="106.679" dur="3.991">the true unemployment is much higher</text>
  <text start="108.899" dur="3.661">than that actually probably very close</text>
  <text start="110.67" dur="4.17">about 23% because remember how all of</text>
  <text start="112.56" dur="4.86">this works if you&amp;#39;re not an interview</text>
  <text start="114.84" dur="4.639">with in four weeks you&amp;#39;re just counted</text>
  <text start="117.42" dur="4.229">as you&amp;#39;re no longer looking for a job</text>
  <text start="119.479" dur="4.21">but what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this</text>
  <text start="121.649" dur="5.101">and we reported on this before is that</text>
  <text start="123.689" dur="5.751">the initial jobless claims well before</text>
  <text start="126.75" dur="5.93">the election as we know they continually</text>
  <text start="129.44" dur="6.43">declined same thing with continuing</text>
  <text start="132.68" dur="5.71">claims they declined all the way up to</text>
  <text start="135.87" dur="5.929">the point of the election then after the</text>
  <text start="138.39" dur="6.45">elections everything just switched</text>
  <text start="141.799" dur="6.881">continuing jobless claims started to</text>
  <text start="144.84" dur="6.149">rise they started to surge and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="148.68" dur="4.679">very interesting is that adp came out</text>
  <text start="150.989" dur="4.141">with their numbers saying that hey in</text>
  <text start="153.359" dur="3.421">January there were two hundred and</text>
  <text start="155.13" dur="5.01">forty-six thousand jobs that were added</text>
  <text start="156.78" dur="5.07">this is incredible so we have ATP on one</text>
  <text start="160.14" dur="4.8">hand saying that all these jobs were</text>
  <text start="161.85" dur="5.52">added we have continuing claims moving</text>
  <text start="164.94" dur="6.69">up initial jobless claims starting to</text>
  <text start="167.37" dur="7.14">creep up and something is out of whack</text>
  <text start="171.63" dur="6.9">right now something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="174.51" dur="4.86">once again and we can see that all of</text>
  <text start="178.53" dur="2.37">this</text>
  <text start="179.37" dur="3.33">does not make sense because all these</text>
  <text start="180.9" dur="3.96">numbers that they&amp;#39;ve been throwing at us</text>
  <text start="182.7" dur="4.709">for a very long time are completely</text>
  <text start="184.86" dur="4.98">manipulated they&amp;#39;ve been skewed the</text>
  <text start="187.409" dur="4.771">calculations changed to fit their</text>
  <text start="189.84" dur="3.479">narrative and they continually do this I</text>
  <text start="192.18" dur="5.58">mean if we look at the student loan</text>
  <text start="193.319" dur="7.381">problem and we discussed this how the</text>
  <text start="197.76" dur="7.14">student loan problem is much bigger than</text>
  <text start="200.7" dur="6.69">anybody ever realized because the</text>
  <text start="204.9" dur="4.86">Department of Education they released a</text>
  <text start="207.39" dur="5.64">memo admitting that repayment rates</text>
  <text start="209.76" dur="6.93">remember this on student loans have been</text>
  <text start="213.03" dur="5.16">grossly exaggerated data from the ninety</text>
  <text start="216.69" dur="4.169">nine point eight percent of the schools</text>
  <text start="218.19" dur="5.669">across the country has been manipulated</text>
  <text start="220.859" dur="5.13">to cover up growing problems with the</text>
  <text start="223.859" dur="4.531">1.3 trillion and outstanding student</text>
  <text start="225.989" dur="7.321">loans now we talked about this before so</text>
  <text start="228.39" dur="6.689">they lied to us all this time they fix</text>
  <text start="233.31" dur="5.009">the books to make us think that</text>
  <text start="235.079" dur="5.461">everything was fine the new calculation</text>
  <text start="238.319" dur="4.59">shows that more than half of all</text>
  <text start="240.54" dur="6.75">borrowers from a thousand different</text>
  <text start="242.909" dur="7.11">institutions have defaulted or not pay</text>
  <text start="247.29" dur="7.05">back a single dollar of their loans over</text>
  <text start="250.019" dur="6.451">the last seven years now this is a very</text>
  <text start="254.34" dur="5.869">big difference from what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="256.47" dur="5.4">telling us this is a very big difference</text>
  <text start="260.209" dur="4.741">but they&amp;#39;ve been telling us about</text>
  <text start="261.87" dur="6.15">everything and this calls into question</text>
  <text start="264.95" dur="5.589">any of the statistics that the</text>
  <text start="268.02" dur="5.16">government agencies are putting out I</text>
  <text start="270.539" dur="4.951">mean we should then question all of it</text>
  <text start="273.18" dur="4.14">we should question GDP we should</text>
  <text start="275.49" dur="5.39">question unemployment we should question</text>
  <text start="277.32" dur="6.8">all of it and go in and check the</text>
  <text start="280.88" dur="5.849">calculations see what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="284.12" dur="5.41">because if they&amp;#39;re lying about one thing</text>
  <text start="286.729" dur="6.791">believe me they&amp;#39;re lying about a lot</text>
  <text start="289.53" dur="6.66">more and what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="293.52" dur="5.429">this is between 1995 and 2015 the</text>
  <text start="296.19" dur="6.659">average cost of a public four-year</text>
  <text start="298.949" dur="7.231">university skyrocketed by over two</text>
  <text start="302.849" dur="6.06">hundred percent and outstanding loans</text>
  <text start="306.18" dur="6.799">accounted for forty five percent of the</text>
  <text start="308.909" dur="4.07">government&amp;#39;s financial assets</text>
  <text start="313.02" dur="7.709">so we see right now that this whole</text>
  <text start="317.099" dur="6.421">thing has been a complete lie now the</text>
  <text start="320.729" dur="5.071">scary part about this revelation is that</text>
  <text start="323.52" dur="5.399">almost ninety percent of outstanding</text>
  <text start="325.8" dur="7.549">private loans are co-signed by parents</text>
  <text start="328.919" dur="6.75">making this an intergenerational problem</text>
  <text start="333.349" dur="6.011">so their parents are going to be on the</text>
  <text start="335.669" dur="5.581">hook for all of this and we&amp;#39;ve been lied</text>
  <text start="339.36" dur="5.19">to all along telling us that everything</text>
  <text start="341.25" dur="5.61">is fine and we&amp;#39;ve been looking at the</text>
  <text start="344.55" dur="4.769">numbers we know it&amp;#39;s not now the</text>
  <text start="346.86" dur="4.92">corporate media is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="349.319" dur="6.361">saying that us productivity growth well</text>
  <text start="351.78" dur="6.75">it just surged up it&amp;#39;s incredible but</text>
  <text start="355.68" dur="5.97">when we look back in time and we look at</text>
  <text start="358.53" dur="5.609">the overall picture we see us</text>
  <text start="361.65" dur="6.359">productivity growth has never been this</text>
  <text start="364.139" dur="7.62">low for this long so put it this way if</text>
  <text start="368.009" dur="7.011">you&amp;#39;re close to zero and it pops up 2.5</text>
  <text start="371.759" dur="6.331">I wouldn&amp;#39;t really call that growth</text>
  <text start="375.02" dur="6.73">because if we go back in time we go back</text>
  <text start="378.09" dur="6.509">two years like in 92 we&amp;#39;re at 2.5 go</text>
  <text start="381.75" dur="7.86">back to 2001 we&amp;#39;re at three if we go</text>
  <text start="384.599" dur="9.841">back to 2004 we&amp;#39;re at four and here we</text>
  <text start="389.61" dur="6.779">are hovering around point five we had a</text>
  <text start="394.44" dur="4.86">little pick up and they&amp;#39;re making a</text>
  <text start="396.389" dur="4.921">really big deal about this it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="399.3" dur="8.359">not that big of a deal actually it is</text>
  <text start="401.31" dur="9.419">awful because we aren&amp;#39;t even close to</text>
  <text start="407.659" dur="7.48">increasing productivity here in the</text>
  <text start="410.729" dur="6.571">United States not even close now in a</text>
  <text start="415.139" dur="5.25">past report we talked about how Iran is</text>
  <text start="417.3" dur="5.369">going to be dumping the dollar now they</text>
  <text start="420.389" dur="6.27">decided to do this a while ago back in</text>
  <text start="422.669" dur="8.461">2016 Huffington Post had the article I</text>
  <text start="426.659" dur="7.5">reported on it in a previous episode now</text>
  <text start="431.13" dur="7.08">they actually set a date the change will</text>
  <text start="434.159" dur="6.301">take effect on march 21st it will impact</text>
  <text start="438.21" dur="6.269">all official financial and foreign</text>
  <text start="440.46" dur="6.63">exchange reports now they&amp;#39;re using what</text>
  <text start="444.479" dur="6.001">Trump did as the excuse of wider</text>
  <text start="447.09" dur="5.579">really dumping the dollar which which is</text>
  <text start="450.48" dur="5.749">completely unbelievable in the first</text>
  <text start="452.669" dur="7.291">case because putting a temporary ban on</text>
  <text start="456.229" dur="7.031">on these individual countries which ran</text>
  <text start="459.96" dur="5.34">as part of it is a ridiculous reason to</text>
  <text start="463.26" dur="4.35">say we&amp;#39;re dumping the dollar because</text>
  <text start="465.3" dur="4.23">think about what has been happening the</text>
  <text start="467.61" dur="3.63">United States bombed all these countries</text>
  <text start="469.53" dur="4.08">the United States replaced the</text>
  <text start="471.24" dur="5.22">government&amp;#39;s in these countries the</text>
  <text start="473.61" dur="4.5">United States invaded Syria Iran has</text>
  <text start="476.46" dur="5.76">been fighting against the United States</text>
  <text start="478.11" dur="5.73">in Syria and all of a sudden because of</text>
  <text start="482.22" dur="3.27">his 90-day band they&amp;#39;re getting all</text>
  <text start="483.84" dur="4.139">crazy about it now they had this plan</text>
  <text start="485.49" dur="4.08">from the beginning they understand the</text>
  <text start="487.979" dur="3.871">dollars dying and they just needed some</text>
  <text start="489.57" dur="4.92">type of an excuse and they saw what was</text>
  <text start="491.85" dur="5.1">going on and they went for it and we</text>
  <text start="494.49" dur="3.929">have to understand that the OPEC</text>
  <text start="496.95" dur="4.02">countries account for forty-two percent</text>
  <text start="498.419" dur="4.681">of global oil production holding</text>
  <text start="500.97" dur="5.819">seventy-three percent of the world&amp;#39;s oil</text>
  <text start="503.1" dur="7.92">reserves and the u.s. is the standard</text>
  <text start="506.789" dur="7.8">currency that is used for trade now when</text>
  <text start="511.02" dur="7.59">countries start to dump the dollar it</text>
  <text start="514.589" dur="7.38">means other countries don&amp;#39;t need the</text>
  <text start="518.61" dur="4.71">dollar to purchase the oil so Iran is</text>
  <text start="521.969" dur="3.421">going to say you know something you can</text>
  <text start="523.32" dur="3.54">buy a royal we&amp;#39;re going to use the euro</text>
  <text start="525.39" dur="3.84">we&amp;#39;re going to use the one the ruble</text>
  <text start="526.86" dur="3.54">everything but the dollar so other</text>
  <text start="529.23" dur="3.33">countries are going to say oh I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="530.4" dur="4.1">need this dollar those dollars come</text>
  <text start="532.56" dur="4.29">flooding back to the United States as</text>
  <text start="534.5" dur="6.82">they come flooding back to United States</text>
  <text start="536.85" dur="6.989">we will see inflation now well it</text>
  <text start="541.32" dur="6.15">happened the second it happens now it</text>
  <text start="543.839" dur="5.401">takes time but we can see this is an</text>
  <text start="547.47" dur="3.39">ongoing issue throughout the Middle East</text>
  <text start="549.24" dur="2.88">because all these countries where the</text>
  <text start="550.86" dur="3.15">people are taking back their countries</text>
  <text start="552.12" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re going to follow suit they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="554.01" dur="7.05">going to use the dollar and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="556.86" dur="7.89">to see major problems here now it looks</text>
  <text start="561.06" dur="8.219">like Trump is zooming in on the Fed</text>
  <text start="564.75" dur="6.9">right now he has his sights set on the</text>
  <text start="569.279" dur="5.701">fed vice chairman of the Financial</text>
  <text start="571.65" dur="5.91">Services Committee well he has lashed</text>
  <text start="574.98" dur="5.34">out at Janet Yellen telling the Fed</text>
  <text start="577.56" dur="3.48">chair in no uncertain terms that despite</text>
  <text start="580.32" dur="2.66">the clear met</text>
  <text start="581.04" dur="4.109">to deliver by president Trump and</text>
  <text start="582.98" dur="4.659">prioritizing America&amp;#39;s interest in</text>
  <text start="585.149" dur="5.75">international negotiations it appears</text>
  <text start="587.639" dur="5.611">that the Federal Reserve continues</text>
  <text start="590.899" dur="4.781">negotiating international regulatory</text>
  <text start="593.25" dur="5.699">standards for financial institutions</text>
  <text start="595.68" dur="4.38">among global bureaucrats in foreign</text>
  <text start="598.949" dur="5.601">lands without transparency</text>
  <text start="600.06" dur="8.639">accountability or the authority to do so</text>
  <text start="604.55" dur="6.49">he then adds the secretive structures of</text>
  <text start="608.699" dur="4.83">these international forms must also be</text>
  <text start="611.04" dur="5.219">reevaluated because when the deals were</text>
  <text start="613.529" dur="5.101">negotiated international standards were</text>
  <text start="616.259" dur="4.591">turned into domestic regulations that</text>
  <text start="618.63" dur="4.709">forced American firms of various sizes</text>
  <text start="620.85" dur="4.739">to substantially raise their capital</text>
  <text start="623.339" dur="5.37">requirements leading to slower economic</text>
  <text start="625.589" dur="6.961">growth here in America and the Fed as we</text>
  <text start="628.709" dur="6.651">know provided tens of billions in under</text>
  <text start="632.55" dur="6.24">the table rescue loans to foreign banks</text>
  <text start="635.36" dur="8.2">covertly monetizing the entire system</text>
  <text start="638.79" dur="7.68">and there is no transparency and we can</text>
  <text start="643.56" dur="5.16">see that Trump at this point is looking</text>
  <text start="646.47" dur="5.04">at the Fed and he&amp;#39;s at the beginning</text>
  <text start="648.72" dur="7.02">stages he&amp;#39;s going to be going up against</text>
  <text start="651.51" dur="6.99">the central bank which means well his</text>
  <text start="655.74" dur="5.399">life is then in danger because the</text>
  <text start="658.5" dur="5.399">central bank&amp;#39;s they have no allegiance</text>
  <text start="661.139" dur="5.76">to a country they have no allegiance to</text>
  <text start="663.899" dur="7.651">a people they don&amp;#39;t care what country</text>
  <text start="666.899" dur="7.291">they&amp;#39;re in as long as you&amp;#39;re using their</text>
  <text start="671.55" dur="7.349">currency and remember their currency is</text>
  <text start="674.19" dur="6.509">created out of thin air and they take</text>
  <text start="678.899" dur="3.271">this currency and they put nation from</text>
  <text start="680.699" dur="4.471">the debt they don&amp;#39;t want to bankrupt</text>
  <text start="682.17" dur="6.39">them they want to keep them at a certain</text>
  <text start="685.17" dur="5.31">level where they&amp;#39;re able to reach you to</text>
  <text start="688.56" dur="4.92">buy their assets on pennies of the</text>
  <text start="690.48" dur="4.68">dollar that&amp;#39;s what they try to do they</text>
  <text start="693.48" dur="4.349">just want to keep them barely afloat</text>
  <text start="695.16" dur="4.979">keep them in that debt then give them a</text>
  <text start="697.829" dur="6.93">little bit more debt while they cut</text>
  <text start="700.139" dur="7.651">programs while people lose jobs and this</text>
  <text start="704.759" dur="4.801">is what they do and they do it too many</text>
  <text start="707.79" dur="4.13">many many countries because they have to</text>
  <text start="709.56" dur="3.86">keep spreading their debt out</text>
  <text start="711.92" dur="5.46">and we can see right now Trump is</text>
  <text start="713.42" dur="7.53">looking at this and saying okay it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="717.38" dur="5.82">time the Fed is not working for America</text>
