  <text start="53.14" dur="5.07">hi and welcome you listening to the ex</text>
  <text start="56.5" dur="5.46">when he to report my name is Dave and</text>
  <text start="58.21" dur="6.51">this is episode 1320 B and today&amp;#39;s data</text>
  <text start="61.96" dur="6.32">is June 30th 2017 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="64.72" dur="6.09">episode is the hammer is about to fall</text>
  <text start="68.28" dur="6.04">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="70.81" dur="6.9">political and geopolitical news now as</text>
  <text start="74.32" dur="4.98">we can see Obamacare well it is</text>
  <text start="77.71" dur="4.17">imploding on itself and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="79.3" dur="5.37">more and more coops completely closed</text>
  <text start="81.88" dur="4.739">down they&amp;#39;re bankrupt and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="84.67" dur="3.839">tracking this for a very long time and</text>
  <text start="86.619" dur="3.75">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing one co-op after</text>
  <text start="88.509" dur="3.541">another completely collapsed we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="90.369" dur="4.17">watchin the insurance premiums move up</text>
  <text start="92.05" dur="4.53">and up and up and we&amp;#39;re seeing that more</text>
  <text start="94.539" dur="4.621">and more individuals they are dropping</text>
  <text start="96.58" dur="4.89">Obamacare now Trump is out there and</text>
  <text start="99.16" dur="4.769">he&amp;#39;s saying that we should just repeal</text>
  <text start="101.47" dur="4.17">Obamacare at this point in time and the</text>
  <text start="103.929" dur="4.741">reason why he&amp;#39;s saying this is because</text>
  <text start="105.64" dur="5.58">as Obamacare implodes and we just let it</text>
  <text start="108.67" dur="4.53">go well a lot of people are going to</text>
  <text start="111.22" dur="5.009">have absolutely no insurance whatsoever</text>
  <text start="113.2" dur="5.309">and the implosion we don&amp;#39;t know what the</text>
  <text start="116.229" dur="5.85">ramifications are going to be when the</text>
  <text start="118.509" dur="7.381">whole thing completely goes bankrupt I</text>
  <text start="122.079" dur="5.911">mean what happens does anyone know no so</text>
  <text start="125.89" dur="5.4">we need to get ahead of this and</text>
  <text start="127.99" dur="5.43">actually get rid of it now we can see at</text>
  <text start="131.29" dur="3.69">this point there&amp;#39;s a lot of people that</text>
  <text start="133.42" dur="3.84">are saying I&amp;#39;m not going into this I</text>
  <text start="134.98" dur="4.8">rather take the penalty by repealing</text>
  <text start="137.26" dur="5.4">Obamacare we get rid of that ridiculous</text>
  <text start="139.78" dur="5.519">penalty which is really a tax on the</text>
  <text start="142.66" dur="4.53">people and I think this is why he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="145.299" dur="3.931">saying at this point we need to get rid</text>
  <text start="147.19" dur="3.84">of this because he sees that listen we</text>
  <text start="149.23" dur="3.479">only have four coops left those are</text>
  <text start="151.03" dur="3.39">going to go other insurance companies</text>
  <text start="152.709" dur="3.301">are going to leave the market and</text>
  <text start="154.42" dur="3.27">there&amp;#39;s going to be less and less people</text>
  <text start="156.01" dur="3.77">joining up and the whole thing just</text>
  <text start="157.69" dur="5.639">going to go down and then what do we do</text>
  <text start="159.78" dur="7.15">so instead of just letting it go we need</text>
  <text start="163.329" dur="6.69">to be proactive now Trump is out there</text>
  <text start="166.93" dur="5.1">and he approved a new oil pipeline to</text>
  <text start="170.019" dur="3.931">Mexico he says is going to go right</text>
  <text start="172.03" dur="4.44">under the wall now remember everything</text>
  <text start="173.95" dur="5.759">that is being done is being set up for</text>
  <text start="176.47" dur="5.099">this reset of the system this is why we</text>
  <text start="179.709" dur="3.691">see all this happening this why doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="181.569" dur="5.67">make sense to a lot of people why would</text>
  <text start="183.4" dur="4.2">we be doing this well back in time back</text>
  <text start="187.239" dur="2.011">in the</text>
  <text start="187.6" dur="3.36">70s they told us were coming off the</text>
  <text start="189.25" dur="4.38">goaltender because of speculators which</text>
  <text start="190.96" dur="5.16">was a lie they told us they were gas</text>
  <text start="193.63" dur="5.85">shortages there wasn&amp;#39;t enough fuel for</text>
  <text start="196.12" dur="6.3">everyone that was a lie and we could see</text>
  <text start="199.48" dur="5.67">at this point they&amp;#39;re trying to make it</text>
  <text start="202.42" dur="4.29">seem like all these things are the wrong</text>
  <text start="205.15" dur="4.8">things just like immigration that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="206.71" dur="5.76">wrong thing making America first that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="209.95" dur="5.22">a wrong thing because remember the</text>
  <text start="212.47" dur="5.43">central bank&amp;#39;s the deep state</text>
  <text start="215.17" dur="5.28">they don&amp;#39;t want America first they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="217.9" dur="5.13">trying to create a global community</text>
  <text start="220.45" dur="6.84">where everyone is blended and they have</text>
  <text start="223.03" dur="9.81">control it goes against everything they</text>
  <text start="227.29" dur="8.1">want now we see that the house they</text>
  <text start="232.84" dur="6.24">might stall the Senate&amp;#39;s Russia</text>
  <text start="235.39" dur="5.82">sanctions bill now remember Trump looked</text>
  <text start="239.08" dur="4.71">at this and other lawmakers look at this</text>
  <text start="241.21" dur="6.03">and said listen these sanctions that</text>
  <text start="243.79" dur="5.46">were created in the Senate well it can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="247.24" dur="4.5">be done in the Senate because the</text>
  <text start="249.25" dur="5.37">revenue part of the bill has to be done</text>
  <text start="251.74" dur="5.88">in the house well it looks like the US</text>
  <text start="254.62" dur="6.179">Senate fixed that problem but the house</text>
  <text start="257.62" dur="5.4">is out there saying listen we might not</text>
  <text start="260.799" dur="5.161">even pass this and first of all they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="263.02" dur="4.65">going on vacation very soon so it looks</text>
  <text start="265.96" dur="3.8">like it might be stalled in the house</text>
  <text start="267.67" dur="6.3">now they wanted to get this bill through</text>
  <text start="269.76" dur="5.95">before the g20 summit where Trump is</text>
  <text start="273.97" dur="4.11">going to meet Putin they wanted to put</text>
  <text start="275.71" dur="6">pressure on Russia this is why there was</text>
  <text start="278.08" dur="5.91">such a push to get this out there and we</text>
  <text start="281.71" dur="4.68">could see at this point the deep state</text>
  <text start="283.99" dur="6.12">they&amp;#39;re still trying to push their</text>
  <text start="286.39" dur="7.05">agenda we see the house has passed HR</text>
  <text start="290.11" dur="5.42">3004 known as Kate&amp;#39;s law which would</text>
  <text start="293.44" dur="4.62">impose mandatory minimum sentences on</text>
  <text start="295.53" dur="4.09">previously removed illegal immigrants</text>
  <text start="298.06" dur="4.92">who returns United States and commits a</text>
  <text start="299.62" dur="7.76">crime and that bill passed with a vote</text>
  <text start="302.98" dur="7.68">of 257 to 167 and the Kate&amp;#39;s law</text>
  <text start="307.38" dur="6.4">enhances penalties for deported felons</text>
  <text start="310.66" dur="5.22">who we torn returned to the US so they</text>
  <text start="313.78" dur="4.08">aren&amp;#39;t free to harm innocent lives</text>
  <text start="315.88" dur="4.05">because what happened with Kate there</text>
  <text start="317.86" dur="3.61">was an illegal immigrant that committed</text>
  <text start="319.93" dur="4.09">murder because why</text>
  <text start="321.47" dur="6.2">they&amp;#39;re not vetted these were a this was</text>
  <text start="324.02" dur="19.62">a known felon and they committed a crime</text>
  <text start="327.67" dur="18.37">the house also passed HR 3304 sment</text>
  <text start="343.64" dur="7.08">request so we can see right right now</text>
  <text start="346.04" dur="9.36">there&amp;#39;s a lockdown on illegal immigrants</text>
  <text start="350.72" dur="7.2">those who commit crimes we see O&amp;#39;Keefe</text>
  <text start="355.4" dur="5.49">from Project Veritas he released another</text>
  <text start="357.92" dur="5.79">video and we see at this point that</text>
  <text start="360.89" dur="5.13">CNN&amp;#39;s internal culture well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="363.71" dur="4.71">basically a culture of let&amp;#39;s get Trump</text>
  <text start="366.02" dur="4.38">well it&amp;#39;s kind of obvious that this was</text>
  <text start="368.42" dur="5.19">what was all about from the beginning</text>
  <text start="370.4" dur="6.33">and we understand now that which we knew</text>
  <text start="373.61" dur="4.83">from all our investigation of this</text>
  <text start="376.73" dur="5.91">Russian collusion thing that all of this</text>
  <text start="378.44" dur="7.979">is completely fake phony and false and</text>
  <text start="382.64" dur="6.779">to take this a step further we see that</text>
  <text start="386.419" dur="5.911">the New York Times article where they</text>
  <text start="389.419" dur="6.151">were citing the 17 intelligence agencies</text>
  <text start="392.33" dur="6.81">that claimed that Russia hacked the u.s.</text>
  <text start="395.57" dur="6.96">elections well it turns out they</text>
  <text start="399.14" dur="5.73">retracted this and this is what everyone</text>
  <text start="402.53" dur="5.46">was pointing to this is what all these</text>
  <text start="404.87" dur="7.32">deep Staters were looking at saying yes</text>
  <text start="407.99" dur="8.16">C 17 US intelligence agencies say that</text>
  <text start="412.19" dur="6.93">Russia hacked into the Democratic emails</text>
  <text start="416.15" dur="6.12">they hacked into the DNC they hacked the</text>
  <text start="419.12" dur="5.7">elections and coming from Robert Perry</text>
  <text start="422.27" dur="5.07">from consortium news the New York Times</text>
  <text start="424.82" dur="5.28">has finally admitted that one of the</text>
  <text start="427.34" dur="5.49">favorite Russian gate canards that all</text>
  <text start="430.1" dur="5.21">17 US intelligence agencies concurred on</text>
  <text start="432.83" dur="6.39">the assessment of Russian hacking of</text>
  <text start="435.31" dur="8.35">Democratic emails is completely false</text>
  <text start="439.22" dur="9.84">they appended and corrected the June</text>
  <text start="443.66" dur="9.64">25th article amazing so think about this</text>
  <text start="449.06" dur="6.729">for a second if you were looking up this</text>
  <text start="453.3" dur="4.649">go online and you were using the fact</text>
  <text start="455.789" dur="5.28">checkers they would have said this</text>
  <text start="457.949" dur="5.101">article is absolutely true everything</text>
  <text start="461.069" dur="5.85">else that everyone else is saying that</text>
  <text start="463.05" dur="7.679">is the fake news well once again it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="466.919" dur="6.361">the opposite all those people that were</text>
  <text start="470.729" dur="4.65">saying that this was fake it turns out</text>
  <text start="473.28" dur="5.43">that it was this is why the</text>
  <text start="475.379" dur="5.88">fact-checking doesn&amp;#39;t work because who</text>
  <text start="478.71" dur="5.37">are the fact checkers where they getting</text>
  <text start="481.259" dur="4.261">the information and we know that most of</text>
  <text start="484.08" dur="5.82">this is run by the intelligence</text>
  <text start="485.52" dur="7.709">community now Susan Rice is agreeing to</text>
  <text start="489.9" dur="6.239">testify before the house and tell panel</text>
  <text start="493.229" dur="4.47">now we know that John Podesta appeared</text>
  <text start="496.139" dur="3.631">before a close session of the House</text>
  <text start="497.699" dur="4.891">Intelligence Committee to offer his</text>
  <text start="499.77" dur="4.649">thoughts on Russian meddling actually he</text>
  <text start="502.59" dur="2.609">should have really been in there to</text>
  <text start="504.419" dur="4.5">discuss</text>
  <text start="505.199" dur="6.991">maybe pedophiles maybe to discuss the</text>
  <text start="508.919" dur="4.92">emails that were released instead of the</text>
  <text start="512.19" dur="3.81">Russian meddling because right now there</text>
  <text start="513.839" dur="4.26">is no Russian meddling so Susan Rice</text>
  <text start="516" dur="5.13">behind closed doors is going to be</text>
  <text start="518.099" dur="6.541">talking about the unmasking of what she</text>
  <text start="521.13" dur="5.88">did and Susan Rice right now has denied</text>
  <text start="524.64" dur="4.68">that her unmasking of Michael Flynn in</text>
  <text start="527.01" dur="5.01">numerous foreign intelligence documents</text>
  <text start="529.32" dur="5.55">was in any way wrong and or intended</text>
  <text start="532.02" dur="4.74">solely as a means to exact political</text>
  <text start="534.87" dur="4.83">retribution for an election that went</text>
  <text start="536.76" dur="5">horribly wrong for her party and of</text>
  <text start="539.7" dur="5.73">course this is what they&amp;#39;re going to say</text>
  <text start="541.76" dur="7.66">but we could see at this point that they</text>
  <text start="545.43" dur="6.06">were unmasking this was a crime Comey</text>
  <text start="549.42" dur="5.039">even admitted that they were crimes</text>
  <text start="551.49" dur="6.57">committed but nobody was investigating</text>
  <text start="554.459" dur="7.561">now something very odd came out of Eric</text>
  <text start="558.06" dur="9.08">Holder he tweeted this and it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="562.02" dur="9.629">ominous warning message that he let out</text>
  <text start="567.14" dur="7.449">he said to the career men and women at</text>
  <text start="571.649" dur="6.351">the Department of Justice the FBI your</text>
  <text start="574.589" dur="7.5">actions integrity will be unfairly</text>
  <text start="578" dur="8.16">questioned be prepared be strong duty</text>
  <text start="582.089" dur="7.441">honor country now</text>
  <text start="586.16" dur="8.05">why would he say this to the Department</text>
  <text start="589.53" dur="6.3">of Justice I mean one is it because</text>
  <text start="594.21" dur="3.87">what&amp;#39;s happening with Susan Rice because</text>
  <text start="595.83" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re starting to talk to these</text>
  <text start="598.08" dur="9.83">individuals is it because of fast and</text>
  <text start="601.35" dur="10.68">furious or is the hammer about to fall</text>
  <text start="607.91" dur="6.94">did they get word that now they have</text>
  <text start="612.03" dur="4.89">proof of what the FBI has been doing</text>
  <text start="614.85" dur="4.05">what the Department of Justice has been</text>
  <text start="616.92" dur="3.3">doing and all those people that have</text>
  <text start="618.9" dur="4.53">been left behind</text>
  <text start="620.22" dur="6.93">well they&amp;#39;re going to be questioned on</text>
  <text start="623.43" dur="9.51">what has been happening and what their</text>
  <text start="627.15" dur="8.9">involvement was and he it sounds like he</text>
  <text start="632.94" dur="7.23">is telling everyone that this is coming</text>
  <text start="636.05" dur="8.86">stick to your lies don&amp;#39;t deviate from</text>
  <text start="640.17" dur="7.65">our story and you will be okay now you</text>
  <text start="644.91" dur="4.62">know a lot of individuals are going to</text>
  <text start="647.82" dur="3.15">say you know something I can&amp;#39;t take it</text>
  <text start="649.53" dur="4.76">anymore I&amp;#39;m going to have to tell the</text>
  <text start="650.97" dur="9.18">truth because we could see already that</text>
  <text start="654.29" dur="9.31">this entire scam these illegal acts well</text>
  <text start="660.15" dur="7.05">it is closing in on them and eventually</text>
  <text start="663.6" dur="6">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is that certain</text>
  <text start="667.2" dur="5.01">individuals they&amp;#39;re going to be going to</text>
  <text start="669.6" dur="4.89">jail and we could see already that</text>
  <text start="672.21" dur="6.96">they&amp;#39;re getting very nervous about all</text>
  <text start="674.49" dur="7.02">of this now Russia they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="679.17" dur="5.58">suspending their payment to the Council</text>

  <text start="703.68" dur="7.26">is factually managed by the pro US</text>
  <text start="707.4" dur="5.61">European bureaucracy then Russia got</text>
  <text start="710.94" dur="3.99">wind of this and they&amp;#39;re saying you know</text>
  <text start="713.01" dur="4.74">something we&amp;#39;re going to stop our</text>

  <text start="737.2" dur="5.67">they could overcome the difficulties</text>
  <text start="739.78" dur="5.88">between Russia and us they can iron</text>
  <text start="742.87" dur="4.35">everything out and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="745.66" dur="3.54">deep state they don&amp;#39;t want this to</text>
  <text start="747.22" dur="3.36">happen they&amp;#39;ve been trying everything I</text>
  <text start="749.2" dur="3.84">mean look they wanted the sanctions to</text>

  <text start="753.04" dur="4.14">that&amp;#39;s not working out so we need to</text>
  <text start="755.41" dur="5.97">look at what else they&amp;#39;re going to try</text>
  <text start="757.18" dur="8.19">to gin up to maybe distract from what is</text>
  <text start="761.38" dur="5.79">going on there now out in Qatar we can</text>
  <text start="765.37" dur="4.26">see that Qatar central bank said on</text>
  <text start="767.17" dur="4.68">Friday it would guarantee all exchange</text>
  <text start="769.63" dur="4.38">transactions for customers inside and</text>
  <text start="771.85" dur="4.65">outside the country without this without</text>
  <text start="774.01" dur="4.44">delay because the media is out there</text>
  <text start="776.5" dur="4.98">reporting that some exchange companies</text>
  <text start="778.45" dur="5.4">has stopped buying the rial but what</text>
  <text start="781.48" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that is not true they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="783.85" dur="4.26">saying everything is fine but what is</text>
  <text start="785.77" dur="6.24">more interesting about all of this is</text>
  <text start="788.11" dur="7.11">that guitar has conducted over 86</text>
  <text start="792.01" dur="7.62">billion worth of transactions in Chinese</text>
  <text start="795.22" dur="7.05">u1 and has signed many agreements with</text>
  <text start="799.63" dur="4.8">China that encourage further economic</text>
  <text start="802.27" dur="4.65">cooperation now this is incredibly</text>
  <text start="804.43" dur="5.58">important because guitar shares its</text>
  <text start="806.92" dur="6.99">major natural gas reserves with Iran and</text>
  <text start="810.01" dur="7.8">Iran also conducts its related business</text>
  <text start="813.91" dur="7.89">with the Chinese you want they bypass</text>
  <text start="817.81" dur="6.44">the dollar completely now if Iran Qatar</text>
  <text start="821.8" dur="7.56">Russia China and many other countries</text>
  <text start="824.25" dur="7.839">continue this well that means there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="829.36" dur="4.68">use for the dollar and we can see over</text>
  <text start="832.089" dur="4.021">time as we&amp;#39;re reporting on all of this</text>
  <text start="834.04" dur="4.17">that more and more countries are</text>
  <text start="836.11" dur="4.95">starting to do this they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="838.21" dur="6.69">bypass the dollar the question is why</text>
  <text start="841.06" dur="5.4">did they decide to do this why are they</text>
  <text start="844.9" dur="3.48">doing this and why they&amp;#39;ve been doing it</text>
  <text start="846.46" dur="4.47">throughout this period of time well we</text>
  <text start="848.38" dur="5.11">know the reason because these countries</text>
  <text start="850.93" dur="5.71">China Russia they understand</text>
  <text start="853.49" dur="6">that the dollar is doomed the dollar</text>
  <text start="856.64" dur="5.22">will not be here the way we know it and</text>
  <text start="859.49" dur="3.93">they know they have to set up trades</text>
  <text start="861.86" dur="3.66">bilateral trades with other countries</text>
  <text start="863.42" dur="4.95">and they need to make sure that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="865.52" dur="4.71">still operational once the dollar ceases</text>
  <text start="868.37" dur="4.5">to be the reserve currency of the world</text>
  <text start="870.23" dur="4.83">and we can see more and more countries</text>
  <text start="872.87" dur="5.1">are signing onto this and they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="875.06" dur="7.44">pushed into that arena they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="877.97" dur="8.7">pushed into this arena on purpose and we</text>
  <text start="882.5" dur="6.99">could see that at this point that the</text>
  <text start="886.67" dur="5.49">clock is ticking down the clock is</text>
  <text start="889.49" dur="4.59">ticking down and the deep state the hole</text>
  <text start="892.16" dur="4.41">the deep state the central banks had on</text>
  <text start="894.08" dur="5.4">all these countries well it is coming to</text>
  <text start="896.57" dur="6.269">an end and we can see it out in the</text>
  <text start="899.48" dur="6.27">middle east they&amp;#39;re losing their grip I</text>
  <text start="902.839" dur="5.19">mean think about it their whole plan in</text>

  <text start="908.029" dur="4.321">change in all these countries control</text>
  <text start="909.649" dur="5.611">the oil put the dollar on the oil build</text>
  <text start="912.35" dur="6.39">a pipeline into Europe to keep the</text>
  <text start="915.26" dur="7.74">system operational to keep control over</text>
  <text start="918.74" dur="5.88">the world until their goal was reached</text>
  <text start="923" dur="3.99">and people say well why would they be</text>
  <text start="924.62" dur="4.98">doing all this all this time because</text>
  <text start="926.99" dur="4.74">their goal was to have a one-world</text>
  <text start="929.6" dur="4.71">government think about what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="931.73" dur="5.37">doing they&amp;#39;ve been going from country to</text>
  <text start="934.31" dur="6.39">country to country having regime change</text>
  <text start="937.1" dur="5.88">putting in a puppet government that</text>
  <text start="940.7" dur="4.829">allows the private western central bank</text>
  <text start="942.98" dur="5.19">into their country which allows the deep</text>
  <text start="945.529" dur="5.101">state to control which allows them to</text>
  <text start="948.17" dur="6.87">have drunk drug trafficking which allows</text>
  <text start="950.63" dur="6.36">them to have human trafficking and you</text>

  <text start="958.85" dur="4.739">Iran eventually into China then into</text>
  <text start="961.1" dur="6.179">Russia and eventually what they wanted</text>
  <text start="963.589" dur="6.661">was to control the world this is their</text>
  <text start="967.279" dur="5.43">plan so when we step back and we take a</text>
  <text start="970.25" dur="5.43">look what has happened well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="972.709" dur="5.311">losing control of Libya Trump once I</text>

  <text start="999.02" dur="4.59">Africa through the throughout the Middle</text>
  <text start="1000.85" dur="6.65">East well they&amp;#39;re gaining traction right</text>
  <text start="1003.61" dur="6.6">now and in Syria well that&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="1007.5" dur="5.35">falling apart there&amp;#39;s going to be no</text>
  <text start="1010.21" dur="7.08">pipeline there&amp;#39;s no there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>

  <text start="1040.589" dur="6.25">they&amp;#39;re going to be losing everything</text>
  <text start="1042.94" dur="7.08">and Trump at this point realizes he has</text>
  <text start="1046.839" dur="7.621">control of the narrative over fake news</text>
  <text start="1050.02" dur="7.77">think about how he started and where he</text>
  <text start="1054.46" dur="6.66">is today how many news stories today</text>
  <text start="1057.79" dur="6.87">about Russian collusion about the</text>
  <text start="1061.12" dur="6.54">Russian hacking about all this stuff</text>
  <text start="1064.66" dur="6">about how the alternative media was part</text>
  <text start="1067.66" dur="4.95">of the Russian propaganda model member</text>
  <text start="1070.66" dur="5.28">they came out with that list all that</text>
  <text start="1072.61" dur="5.79">turned out to be completely fake and the</text>
  <text start="1075.94" dur="6.39">fake news narrative has now switched to</text>
  <text start="1078.4" dur="8.73">CNN with Project Veritas exposing</text>
  <text start="1082.33" dur="7.89">everything they&amp;#39;ve done and while all</text>

  <text start="1096.25" dur="3.54">taking time yes in the beginning it</text>
  <text start="1098.41" dur="4.83">doesn&amp;#39;t look like this is what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1099.79" dur="5.22">happening the situation in North Korea</text>
  <text start="1103.24" dur="4.29">even though the corporate media is going</text>
  <text start="1105.01" dur="5.31">to put out the headline Oh Trump says</text>
  <text start="1107.53" dur="5.76">that North Korea they can&amp;#39;t continue</text>
  <text start="1110.32" dur="4.83">with their horrific act this is for the</text>
  <text start="1113.29" dur="5.36">press this is for the deep state this is</text>

  <text start="1155.79" dur="4.32">that the past president has said listen</text>
  <text start="1158.16" dur="4.41">you can&amp;#39;t touch this because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1160.11" dur="5.79">natural resources that the United States</text>
  <text start="1162.57" dur="5.27">are going to need remember these</text>
  <text start="1165.9" dur="4.95">presidents were putting these lands as</text>
  <text start="1167.84" dur="7.42">you know national parks and all these</text>
  <text start="1170.85" dur="6.6">things as collateral for the debt the</text>
  <text start="1175.26" dur="4.89">manufacturing that he&amp;#39;s promising this</text>
  <text start="1177.45" dur="4.59">is for after the reset he needs promises</text>
  <text start="1180.15" dur="4.05">from these companies saying listen if we</text>
  <text start="1182.04" dur="4.08">get rid of regulations if we break</text>

  <text start="1186.12" dur="5.49">to come back will you come back yes we</text>
  <text start="1188.58" dur="5.34">will but we can&amp;#39;t do it right now the</text>
  <text start="1191.61" dur="4.77">way the economy is the way the</text>
  <text start="1193.92" dur="3.59">regulations are it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="1196.38" dur="4.14">impossible</text>
  <text start="1197.51" dur="4.24">he knows this the people under him know</text>
  <text start="1200.52" dur="3.72">this the people that are helping him</text>
  <text start="1201.75" dur="5.22">know this this is why they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1204.24" dur="4.32">change the economy this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1206.97" dur="3.24">looking at NAFTA this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1208.56" dur="4.71">looking at this is why he cancelled the</text>
  <text start="1210.21" dur="4.89">TPP this is why he needs to get rid of</text>
  <text start="1213.27" dur="4.11">Obamacare is the other health insurance</text>
  <text start="1215.1" dur="4.47">plan better know because that was made</text>
  <text start="1217.38" dur="5.67">up by the Republicans by the Senate can</text>
  <text start="1219.57" dur="5.22">you just repeal Obamacare well as it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1223.05" dur="3.93">imploding this is what he wanted to do</text>
  <text start="1224.79" dur="4.95">from the beginning repeal it then look</text>
  <text start="1226.98" dur="4.2">for something different and of course we</text>
  <text start="1229.74" dur="3.48">know that Congress wasn&amp;#39;t going to go</text>
  <text start="1231.18" dur="2.51">for this he just couldn&amp;#39;t do it on his</text>
  <text start="1233.22" dur="4.5">own</text>
  <text start="1233.69" dur="5.71">now that Obamacare is imploding like he</text>
  <text start="1237.72" dur="4.05">said it was going to be like we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1239.4" dur="4.65">tracking it all along now it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="1241.77" dur="3.87">good chance to say listen it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="1244.05" dur="3.96">to the point that if we don&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="1245.64" dur="6.21">something a lot of people are going to</text>
  <text start="1248.01" dur="5.46">suffer from Obamacare crashing and yes</text>
  <text start="1251.85" dur="2.4">he&amp;#39;s saying maybe we can look at the</text>
  <text start="1253.47" dur="2.88">health insurance</text>
  <text start="1254.25" dur="4.26">later on which i think is a good idea</text>
  <text start="1256.35" dur="5.64">because why don&amp;#39;t we come up with a good</text>
  <text start="1258.51" dur="6.39">plan and leave those lobbyists those</text>
  <text start="1261.99" dur="4.17">health insurance people out of this why</text>
  <text start="1264.9" dur="3.51">don&amp;#39;t we come up with a plan that&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="1266.16" dur="4.77">for the people that&amp;#39;s where we need to</text>
  <text start="1268.41" dur="4.23">head so when we start to look at all of</text>
  <text start="1270.93" dur="4.86">this forget about all the propaganda</text>
  <text start="1272.64" dur="6.27">about him tweeting about what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1275.79" dur="5.67">in CNN MSNBC this is a distraction for</text>
  <text start="1278.91" dur="5.25">all these propaganda outlets to keep</text>
  <text start="1281.46" dur="5.55">them all busy to have them argue with</text>
  <text start="1284.16" dur="5.25">each other about ridiculousness why he</text>

  <text start="1297.87" dur="4.74">happening think about how the deep state</text>
  <text start="1299.45" dur="5.77">got our country into this did they do it</text>
  <text start="1302.61" dur="5.52">all at once no they did it a little bit</text>

  <text start="1312.78" dur="4.02">happening</text>
  <text start="1313.29" dur="5.94">he&amp;#39;s unwinding everything a little bit</text>
