  <text start="128.789" dur="4.081">that is coming up very quickly and if</text>
  <text start="130.86" dur="4.62">this does happen you&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="132.87" dur="5.1">other countries follow now here in the</text>
  <text start="135.48" dur="4.14">United States we see things rapidly</text>
  <text start="137.97" dur="4.14">falling apart now each time we talk</text>
  <text start="139.62" dur="4.91">about different economic sectors we can</text>
  <text start="142.11" dur="4.95">see that the deteriorating declining and</text>
  <text start="144.53" dur="6.039">we&amp;#39;re moving back into the situation we</text>
  <text start="147.06" dur="5.49">were in 2008 now when we look at the</text>
  <text start="150.569" dur="4.621">retail stocks they are broadly lower</text>
  <text start="152.55" dur="5.46">with about 83 of 91 components of the SP</text>
  <text start="155.19" dur="5.25">1500 retail index trading there in the</text>
  <text start="158.01" dur="4.589">red so when we look at different stores</text>
  <text start="160.44" dur="4.5">and we look at what&amp;#39;s going on here we</text>
  <text start="162.599" dur="4.321">see things are rapidly deteriorating</text>
  <text start="164.94" dur="4.68">very very quickly Wells Fargo states</text>
  <text start="166.92" dur="5.73">it&amp;#39;s increasingly clear that retail is</text>
  <text start="169.62" dur="6.269">under significant pressure adding that</text>
  <text start="172.65" dur="4.8">store traffic remains weak and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="175.889" dur="4.77">likely to get softer this week due to</text>
  <text start="177.45" dur="3.93">the Easter shift so they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="180.659" dur="2.701">traffic</text>
  <text start="181.38" dur="4.62">is drying up and Easter is not going to</text>
  <text start="183.36" dur="4.26">help actually it&amp;#39;s going to become even</text>
  <text start="186" dur="3.42">worse as we move forward throughout this</text>
  <text start="187.62" dur="5.07">year because we see more and more</text>
  <text start="189.42" dur="6.21">individuals losing their jobs we see</text>
  <text start="192.69" dur="5.19">retail stores contracting closing laying</text>
  <text start="195.63" dur="5.37">off individuals and retail right now</text>
  <text start="197.88" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re running out of time to reach the</text>
  <text start="201" dur="4.14">elevated q1 numbers they&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="203.31" dur="5.01">going to make it this year and Wells</text>
  <text start="205.14" dur="5.64">Fargo well their retail team conducted</text>
  <text start="208.32" dur="6.41">channel checks and you know what they</text>
  <text start="210.78" dur="7.83">found they found that traffic declined</text>
  <text start="214.73" dur="6.66">13.3 percent month on month and negative</text>
  <text start="218.61" dur="6.54">two point four percent year-on-year</text>
  <text start="221.39" dur="5.98">traffic is continually declining we see</text>
  <text start="225.15" dur="4.05">many stores out there saying that lives</text>
  <text start="227.37" dur="4.59">in their sales estimates their</text>
  <text start="229.2" dur="5.28">completeness revenue is down lovato is</text>
  <text start="231.96" dur="4.86">reporting fourth-quarter sales well they</text>
  <text start="234.48" dur="3.9">missed estimates completely and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="236.82" dur="3.57">seeing other store sales listen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="238.38" dur="4.14">just gonna have to close down our retail</text>
  <text start="240.39" dur="3.42">chain here we can&amp;#39;t survive anymore</text>
  <text start="242.52" dur="3.21">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to let these people go</text>
  <text start="243.81" dur="3.78">so when we&amp;#39;re looking we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="245.73" dur="4.8">the whole entire situation and things</text>
  <text start="247.59" dur="6.06">are dramatically getting worse as we</text>
  <text start="250.53" dur="5.49">move forward here now a couple of</text>
  <text start="253.65" dur="5.52">reports ago we talked about bank loan</text>
  <text start="256.02" dur="5.67">creation and how that was declining well</text>
  <text start="259.17" dur="4.59">we have the latest update to the feds</text>
  <text start="261.69" dur="4.41">latest weekly commercial bank loan data</text>
  <text start="263.76" dur="4.89">and it looks like things have</text>
  <text start="266.1" dur="5.01">deteriorated substantially total loans</text>
  <text start="268.65" dur="5.55">and leases grew only 4.2 percent in the</text>
  <text start="271.11" dur="6.12">week ended march 8th the lowest growth</text>
  <text start="274.2" dur="5.19">rate since May of 2014 whether it was</text>
  <text start="277.23" dur="5.88">once again the commercial and industrial</text>
  <text start="279.39" dur="5.97">own creations or lack thereof which was</text>
  <text start="283.11" dur="4.83">more problematic because after growing</text>
  <text start="285.36" dur="5.01">four percent on a year-over-year basis</text>
  <text start="287.94" dur="4.8">as a march first in five point seven</text>
  <text start="290.37" dur="5.28">percent one month ago as a februari</text>
  <text start="292.74" dur="7.14">eight the growth rate has since tumbled</text>
  <text start="295.65" dur="6.12">to just 2.9 percent a 1.1 percent</text>
  <text start="299.88" dur="4.86">decline in growth rate over the past</text>
  <text start="301.77" dur="5.79">week this was the biggest monthly slow</text>
  <text start="304.74" dur="6.3">down going back to the financial crisis</text>
  <text start="307.56" dur="7.05">so when we look at this the whole thing</text>
  <text start="311.04" dur="4.26">does not look good whatsoever it appears</text>
  <text start="314.61" dur="3.119">the</text>
  <text start="315.3" dur="5.94">flexion point can hit within the next</text>
  <text start="317.729" dur="4.351">few weeks not the next few months and it</text>
  <text start="321.24" dur="4.32">looks like we&amp;#39;re going to be running</text>
  <text start="322.08" dur="5.519">into huge problems here big problems</text>
  <text start="325.56" dur="3.569">deutsche bank right now well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="327.599" dur="3.331">saying after raising capital at</text>
  <text start="329.129" dur="3.75">thirty-five percent discount over the</text>
  <text start="330.93" dur="4.079">weekend deutsche bank shares are</text>
  <text start="332.879" dur="6.451">tumbling once again back into the red</text>
  <text start="335.009" dur="7.201">for 2017 to for the 27-year CEO john</text>
  <text start="339.33" dur="6.899">cryin warned that revenue would be</text>
  <text start="342.21" dur="6.509">broadly flat throughout 2017 which means</text>
  <text start="346.229" dur="4.921">it&amp;#39;s going to drop even further and</text>
  <text start="348.719" dur="4.95">things are going to get even worse as we</text>
  <text start="351.15" dur="5.94">move forward we see that the banks</text>
  <text start="353.669" dur="6.441">throughout Europe they are struggling if</text>
  <text start="357.09" dur="6.09">the ECB right now scales back stimulus</text>
  <text start="360.11" dur="4.72">banks face even greater risk of collapse</text>
  <text start="363.18" dur="4.56">but they&amp;#39;re coming up with a solution</text>
  <text start="364.83" dur="4.35">like they always do and when I say they</text>
  <text start="367.74" dur="5.13">I&amp;#39;m talking about the central bankers</text>
  <text start="369.18" dur="7.62">because it looks like the ECB the Bank</text>
  <text start="372.87" dur="6.599">of Japan the Fed they&amp;#39;re scaling back on</text>
  <text start="376.8" dur="4.56">QE right now to bring down the entire</text>
  <text start="379.469" dur="3.871">system now remember they have these</text>
  <text start="381.36" dur="3.72">stress tests on the banks to us that the</text>
  <text start="383.34" dur="4.189">banks are strong only this bank failed</text>
  <text start="385.08" dur="5.1">but when we look at the entire situation</text>
  <text start="387.529" dur="5.26">european banks they are in a whole lot</text>
  <text start="390.18" dur="5.01">of trouble right now now events are</text>
  <text start="392.789" dur="5.071">moving very fast in europe it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="395.19" dur="5.67">impossible to keep up but the total</text>
  <text start="397.86" dur="6.299">stock of non-performing loans npl and</text>
  <text start="400.86" dur="5.519">the EU is estimated over one trillion</text>
  <text start="404.159" dur="5.341">euros or five point four percent of</text>
  <text start="406.379" dur="5.4">total loans a ratio three times higher</text>
  <text start="409.5" dur="5.94">than in other major regions of the world</text>
  <text start="411.779" dur="6.57">now on a country-by-country basis how</text>
  <text start="415.44" dur="6.509">things look even scarier currently 10</text>
  <text start="418.349" dur="6">out of the 28 EU countries have an npl</text>
  <text start="421.949" dur="4.5">ratio above ten percent and among</text>

  <text start="454.259" dur="4.831">they&amp;#39;re completely toxic this is a</text>
  <text start="456.479" dur="4.801">terrible situation now the ECB vice</text>
  <text start="459.09" dur="5.31">president called for the creation of a</text>
  <text start="461.28" dur="5.49">whole new class of government-backed bad</text>
  <text start="464.4" dur="5.28">banks to help buy some of the one</text>
  <text start="466.77" dur="4.41">trillion euro of bad loans so basically</text>
  <text start="469.68" dur="3.51">what they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="471.18" dur="4.829">going to do a euro tarp and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="473.19" dur="4.229">going to buy up all the bad debt just</text>
  <text start="476.009" dur="3.87">like they did here in the United States</text>
  <text start="477.419" dur="4.74">and who has to flip the bill here the</text>
  <text start="479.879" dur="4.35">taxpayers once again this is what</text>
  <text start="482.159" dur="3.451">they&amp;#39;re going to use to bail out these</text>
  <text start="484.229" dur="3.78">bangs once again they&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="485.61" dur="5.58">taxpayer money so we can see at this</text>
  <text start="488.009" dur="6.451">point the banks they&amp;#39;re doomed the ECB</text>
  <text start="491.19" dur="4.92">well they&amp;#39;re scaling back and every time</text>
  <text start="494.46" dur="3.989">they scale back and they don&amp;#39;t pump up</text>
  <text start="496.11" dur="4.649">the banks we see what they&amp;#39;re truly like</text>
  <text start="498.449" dur="5.071">what what is really going on and these</text>
  <text start="500.759" dur="4.351">bangs are in a whole lot of trouble now</text>
  <text start="503.52" dur="4.41">they haven&amp;#39;t been given a green light</text>
  <text start="505.11" dur="4.83">right now because the scheme if it does</text>
  <text start="507.93" dur="5.239">get the green light it would pave the</text>
  <text start="509.94" dur="6.899">way to the biggest one off bailout of</text>
  <text start="513.169" dur="6.581">European Bank history I mean this would</text>
  <text start="516.839" dur="4.83">be unbelievable and we&amp;#39;ll have to see</text>
  <text start="519.75" dur="4.14">how this goes because if they don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="521.669" dur="3.811">the bailout well it looks like the</text>
  <text start="523.89" dur="4.62">system is going to come down even faster</text>
  <text start="525.48" dur="4.44">now looking at what Trump wants to do</text>
  <text start="528.51" dur="4.019">here where he wants to bring back</text>
  <text start="529.92" dur="4.53">manufacturing jobs he wants to bring</text>
  <text start="532.529" dur="5.101">back the employees back to the United</text>
  <text start="534.45" dur="6.36">States make America great again to do</text>
  <text start="537.63" dur="5.82">all of this to have the United States as</text>
  <text start="540.81" dur="4.86">a manufacturing powerhouse he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="543.45" dur="4.74">have to basically collapse the dollar</text>
  <text start="545.67" dur="4.919">you can have to make it very weak which</text>
  <text start="548.19" dur="5.04">will set off additional currency wars</text>
  <text start="550.589" dur="5.37">trade wars and we could see right now if</text>
  <text start="553.23" dur="4.71">he really wants to do that for the</text>
  <text start="555.959" dur="4.111">United States to be competitive he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="557.94" dur="4.08">going to have to really devalue the</text>
  <text start="560.07" dur="4.139">dollar and he&amp;#39;s gonna have to make it</text>
  <text start="562.02" dur="3.99">weak against other currencies and other</text>
  <text start="564.209" dur="3.961">currencies are then going to bring down</text>
  <text start="566.01" dur="4.74">their currency value and it will be a</text>
  <text start="568.17" dur="4.05">fight but when you look at this and if</text>
  <text start="570.75" dur="3.47">this is exactly what he&amp;#39;s going to do</text>
  <text start="572.22" dur="5.55">it&amp;#39;s going to be very good for gold and</text>
  <text start="574.22" dur="5.5">gold will then move up because the value</text>
  <text start="577.77" dur="3.39">of the dollar is going down now will</text>
  <text start="579.72" dur="2.07">they try to manipulate it of course they</text>
  <text start="581.16" dur="2.31">will</text>
  <text start="581.79" dur="3.63">but other countries and other places</text>
  <text start="583.47" dur="4.29">around the world they might attach</text>
  <text start="585.42" dur="3.96">premiums to it and eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="587.76" dur="3.06">going to happen as the dollar</text>
  <text start="589.38" dur="4.89">continually gets weaker and we can</text>
  <text start="590.82" dur="5.85">weaker gold is going to break out and we</text>
  <text start="594.27" dur="4.38">could see that if he truly wants to do</text>
  <text start="596.67" dur="4.71">this this is the path he&amp;#39;s going to have</text>
  <text start="598.65" dur="4.83">to take now so far nothing has been done</text>
  <text start="601.38" dur="5.04">no manufacturing plants have been built</text>
  <text start="603.48" dur="6.09">no manufacturing jobs have been brought</text>
  <text start="606.42" dur="5.58">back all that offshoring has not stopped</text>
  <text start="609.57" dur="5.73">at all we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of retail</text>
  <text start="612" dur="6.66">we&amp;#39;re still seeing companies laying off</text>
  <text start="615.3" dur="5.61">that has not stopped at all we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="618.66" dur="5.73">a lot of banks they&amp;#39;re ready to go under</text>
  <text start="620.91" dur="4.83">and we have this debt ceiling where no</text>
  <text start="624.39" dur="2.4">one in government no one on the</text>
  <text start="625.74" dur="3.15">corporate media they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="626.79" dur="4.38">mentioning it it&amp;#39;s like it doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="628.89" dur="4.44">exist but we know when the government</text>
  <text start="631.17" dur="4.02">starts running out of money and of court</text>
  <text start="633.33" dur="4.23">in the David Stockman we&amp;#39;re not even to</text>
  <text start="635.19" dur="3.9">make it to Memorial Day that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="637.56" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;re going to see everyone come out and</text>

  <text start="641.67" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re going to see arguments on both</text>
  <text start="643.83" dur="4.98">sides and this is when things are going</text>
  <text start="646.17" dur="5.25">to get ugly so if we get into May and</text>
  <text start="648.81" dur="5.25">they haven&amp;#39;t made a decision yet and we</text>
  <text start="651.42" dur="5.73">get close to a memorial day again this</text>
  <text start="654.06" dur="5.31">is another sign that you need to ramp up</text>
  <text start="657.15" dur="4.17">your preps here because if they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="659.37" dur="3.93">going to take the seal the debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="661.32" dur="3.33">and raise it which doesn&amp;#39;t mean this</text>
  <text start="663.3" dur="4.08">solves the problem it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="664.65" dur="5.64">temporary we&amp;#39;re going to revisit this</text>
  <text start="667.38" dur="5.43">issue once again they&amp;#39;re just kicking</text>
  <text start="670.29" dur="4.56">the can down the street now Trump can</text>
  <text start="672.81" dur="3.51">play this two ways he can say you know</text>
  <text start="674.85" dur="3.32">what we&amp;#39;re not raising the debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="676.32" dur="5.28">he&amp;#39;s going to bring down the economy</text>
  <text start="678.17" dur="6.04">reduce the value of the dollar and let</text>
  <text start="681.6" dur="5.49">the economy completely collapse let the</text>
  <text start="684.21" dur="5.49">country default on its debt which means</text>
  <text start="687.09" dur="3.84">countries around the world well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="689.7" dur="2.76">going to look at the situation and say</text>
  <text start="690.93" dur="3.81">we don&amp;#39;t want dollars anymore they just</text>
  <text start="692.46" dur="4.47">defaulted on their debt the system will</text>
  <text start="694.74" dur="4.65">collapse if the debt ceiling is raised</text>

  <text start="703.8" dur="3.51">this and I&amp;#39;m seeing a battle between two</text>
  <text start="705.9" dur="4.98">forces right now but the interesting</text>
  <text start="707.31" dur="7.509">thing about all this is that the outcome</text>
  <text start="710.88" dur="7.019">is exactly the same it just depends on</text>
  <text start="714.819" dur="6.45">when and how but the outcome is a</text>
  <text start="717.899" dur="6.18">complete collapse of the system one way</text>
  <text start="721.269" dur="5.641">or another and when the system collapses</text>
  <text start="724.079" dur="4.3">countries around the world well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="726.91" dur="2.94">not going to keep the dollar anymore</text>

  <text start="736.929" dur="3.93">they possibly can because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="738.879" dur="4.38">want to hold on to it which means we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="740.859" dur="3.741">going to see inflation so whatever</text>
  <text start="743.259" dur="3.99">scenario we&amp;#39;re looking at right now</text>
  <text start="744.6" dur="4.87">we&amp;#39;re headed to the same exact direction</text>
