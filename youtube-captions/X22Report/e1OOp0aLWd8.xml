  <text start="112.69" dur="5.219">we know the banks open up in Cyprus and</text>
  <text start="115.11" dur="4.119">everyone sitting there going oh my god</text>
  <text start="117.909" dur="2.491">there&amp;#39;s no bank runs what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="119.229" dur="3.511">everyone said was going to be a bank run</text>
  <text start="120.4" dur="7.77">we have to remember their capital</text>
  <text start="122.74" dur="7.98">controls in place people aren&amp;#39;t allowed</text>
  <text start="128.17" dur="3.899">to take their money so there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="130.72" dur="3.529">to make a run on the banks there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="132.069" dur="4.381">nothing to get they won&amp;#39;t give it to you</text>
  <text start="134.249" dur="4.151">they can only take a certain amount in</text>
  <text start="136.45" dur="3.3">the ATM ulan can write a certain amount</text>
  <text start="138.4" dur="3.3">in checks</text>
  <text start="139.75" dur="4.74">and everything is completely controlled</text>
  <text start="141.7" dur="4.77">now the president of Cyprus said that</text>
  <text start="144.49" dur="6.39">these will probably be lifted within a</text>
  <text start="146.47" dur="6.09">month or so so during this time and I</text>
  <text start="150.88" dur="3.81">understand this believe me I am like</text>
  <text start="152.56" dur="3.69">this too you&amp;#39;re like okay everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="154.69" dur="5.69">talking about economic collapse where is</text>
  <text start="156.25" dur="4.13">it already but you have to remember that</text>
  <text start="160.65" dur="7.27">the people who are planning this try to</text>
  <text start="164.74" dur="5.25">stretch it out as long as they can to</text>
  <text start="167.92" dur="5.52">make sure that they get all the wealth</text>
  <text start="169.99" dur="6.42">to make sure that everything is done the</text>
  <text start="173.44" dur="5.67">way they want it to be done now there</text>
  <text start="176.41" dur="5.99">are times when things can&amp;#39;t go their way</text>
  <text start="179.11" dur="4.98">because there&amp;#39;s you know certain</text>
  <text start="182.4" dur="3.91">circumstances that are out of their</text>
  <text start="184.09" dur="6.17">control but if they can kick things down</text>
  <text start="186.31" dur="6.36">down the street they will and here</text>
  <text start="190.26" dur="5.199">they&amp;#39;re doing it I mean they kept banks</text>
  <text start="192.67" dur="4.92">closed for what it was like 10 days now</text>
  <text start="195.459" dur="3.961">they have capital controls you&amp;#39;re only</text>
  <text start="197.59" dur="3.36">allowed to take out a still certain</text>
  <text start="199.42" dur="3.21">amount of money so who care really cares</text>
  <text start="200.95" dur="4.259">the bank&amp;#39;s foreclosed are not closed but</text>
  <text start="202.63" dur="4.95">you know I guess it allows them a little</text>
  <text start="205.209" dur="5.611">bit more freedom but there are no runs</text>
  <text start="207.58" dur="5.85">on the banks and you saw if you I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="210.82" dur="5.16">know if you came to the x 22 report com</text>
  <text start="213.43" dur="6.17">site or you listening to this on youtube</text>
  <text start="215.98" dur="7.53">but I had some pictures up of people and</text>
  <text start="219.6" dur="6.58">you see people standing outside and they</text>
  <text start="223.51" dur="5.1">were trying to be civilized and orderly</text>
  <text start="226.18" dur="6.899">but the thing to take away from all of</text>
  <text start="228.61" dur="8.129">this is that what are people going to do</text>
  <text start="233.079" dur="6.5">in other countries because if this</text>
  <text start="236.739" dur="5.97">starts happening in Italy and Spain</text>
  <text start="239.579" dur="6.371">where they start where they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="242.709" dur="5.971">about taking people&amp;#39;s money out from the</text>
  <text start="245.95" dur="7.039">bank to cover their losses they</text>
  <text start="248.68" dur="6.739">shouldn&amp;#39;t wait until the bank closes</text>
  <text start="252.989" dur="7.75">they should start taking their money out</text>
  <text start="255.419" dur="8.381">now so I&amp;#39;m hoping that and I&amp;#39;m we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="260.739" dur="5.881">seeing some of this happen where people</text>
  <text start="263.8" dur="4.29">are starting to wise up and to start to</text>
  <text start="266.62" dur="3.54">take their money out of the bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="268.09" dur="5.37">because you have to remember the Cyprus</text>
  <text start="270.16" dur="5.61">people one day they went to bed</text>
  <text start="273.46" dur="9">next day they woke up they had no access</text>
  <text start="275.77" dur="8.519">whatsoever now in Cyprus they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="282.46" dur="4.29">about they that they might have to take</text>
  <text start="284.289" dur="4.891">more than forty percent that it could be</text>
  <text start="286.75" dur="5.96">as much as eighty percent now and again</text>
  <text start="289.18" dur="5.85">I go through this over and over and over</text>
  <text start="292.71" dur="4.239">every time they tell you it&amp;#39;s a one-off</text>
  <text start="295.03" dur="4.77">or they&amp;#39;re only going to take six</text>
  <text start="296.949" dur="6.15">percent or five percent it really is</text>
  <text start="299.8" dur="6.179">never that it&amp;#39;s always more it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="303.099" dur="5.671">worse than you think it&amp;#39;s never what</text>
  <text start="305.979" dur="4.56">they tell you and you&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="308.77" dur="3.72">these accounts that are frozen with a</text>
  <text start="310.539" dur="3.931">hundred thousand or more you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="312.49" dur="6.179">see much more than forty percent taken</text>
  <text start="314.47" dur="6.9">from them and people in other countries</text>
  <text start="318.669" dur="5.611">when they actually see this that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="321.37" dur="4.53">things will come alive and especially if</text>
  <text start="324.28" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re telling us the truth that</text>
  <text start="325.9" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re going to you know get rid of the</text>
  <text start="328.36" dur="4.14">controls and hopefully I think Iceland</text>
  <text start="331" dur="5.039">had controls for five years or whatever</text>
  <text start="332.5" dur="5.55">it is if they&amp;#39;re really going to get rid</text>
  <text start="336.039" dur="4.591">of the capital controls on the banks</text>
  <text start="338.05" dur="3.48">within a month and they&amp;#39;re hoping that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="340.63" dur="2.43">why they&amp;#39;re saying a month they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="341.53" dur="3.09">hoping that everything comes down people</text>
  <text start="343.06" dur="4.74">forget and they go on with their lives</text>
  <text start="344.62" dur="5.88">at that point you&amp;#39;re going to see people</text>
  <text start="347.8" dur="3.959">say I want all my money and that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="350.5" dur="3.63">you&amp;#39;re going to see all this happened</text>
  <text start="351.759" dur="5.97">but what&amp;#39;s funny today in the news is</text>
  <text start="354.13" dur="6.15">that you see this whole thing about the</text>
  <text start="357.729" dur="4.231">kinetic Connecticut shooting they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="360.28" dur="6.18">want anyone to know about Cyprus I mean</text>
  <text start="361.96" dur="7.35">really I mean they really it it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="366.46" dur="5.67">hard to find news on Cyprus on the</text>
  <text start="369.31" dur="5.159">mainstream media but if you want to know</text>
  <text start="372.13" dur="4.92">about the Connecticut shooting it was</text>
  <text start="374.469" dur="5.521">all over the place hey if you wanted to</text>
  <text start="377.05" dur="5.58">know about the recent cyber attack which</text>
  <text start="379.99" dur="5.57">was the big biggest one ever it was all</text>

  <text start="401.32" dur="5.659">different things they found and you know</text>
  <text start="404.139" dur="2.84">why they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="407.2" dur="4.47">there&amp;#39;s only one reason they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="409.12" dur="6.75">this the reason they&amp;#39;re doing this is</text>
  <text start="411.67" dur="9.99">because the Feinstein bill the UN arms</text>
  <text start="415.87" dur="7.71">treaty well pretty much the Feinstein</text>

  <text start="438.69" dur="8.35">mainstream media outlet report on this</text>
  <text start="442.81" dur="8.48">to get those gun control people riled up</text>
  <text start="447.04" dur="7.38">again and they&amp;#39;re trying to get support</text>
  <text start="451.29" dur="7.15">because they&amp;#39;re losing support and this</text>
  <text start="454.42" dur="6.06">is how you can tell that the cracks of</text>
  <text start="458.44" dur="5.04">the economic collapse are starting to</text>
  <text start="460.48" dur="7.59">shine through because they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="463.48" dur="7.23">everything in their power to get guns</text>
  <text start="468.07" dur="4.56">away from Americans now all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="470.71" dur="5.34">they brought this out of nowhere all of</text>
  <text start="472.63" dur="8.07">a sudden and it&amp;#39;s funny again on every</text>
  <text start="476.05" dur="7.83">single news outlet CNN Fox us today</text>
  <text start="480.7" dur="5.58">there it was I mean they must get a memo</text>
  <text start="483.88" dur="5.73">saying okay post this up there this is</text>
  <text start="486.28" dur="8.16">what we&amp;#39;re doing today but they are</text>
  <text start="489.61" dur="7.47">trying as hard as they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="494.44" dur="5.87">get everyone on board with this gun</text>
  <text start="497.08" dur="6.12">control because they know what&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="500.31" dur="7.75">it&amp;#39;s almost like the biggest cyber</text>
  <text start="503.2" dur="7.59">attack that hit yesterday and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="508.06" dur="6.3">saying it possibly could be from Russia</text>
  <text start="510.79" dur="6.42">and it&amp;#39;s funny how they always they can</text>
  <text start="514.36" dur="5.31">find out where all these major cyber</text>
  <text start="517.21" dur="4.83">attacks are they know exactly they can</text>
  <text start="519.67" dur="4.35">pinpoint the location but they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="522.04" dur="4.71">stop the damn spam coming to your</text>
  <text start="524.02" dur="4.74">mailboxes isn&amp;#39;t that amazing they have</text>
  <text start="526.75" dur="4.62">no idea where because they really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="528.76" dur="4.71">have any idea you know how hard it is to</text>
  <text start="531.37" dur="4.83">Trey something because you can bounce it</text>
  <text start="533.47" dur="7.02">off server to server to server I mean</text>
  <text start="536.2" dur="7.48">it&amp;#39;s so hard that</text>
  <text start="540.49" dur="5.86">that there&amp;#39;s no it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s virtually</text>
  <text start="543.68" dur="5.219">impossible because it&amp;#39;s something called</text>
  <text start="546.35" dur="6.63">proxy servers now you can have a</text>
  <text start="548.899" dur="7.471">thousand proxy servers where it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="552.98" dur="4.799">an address of of a server and it could</text>
  <text start="556.37" dur="3.3">be anywhere in the world and they can</text>
  <text start="557.779" dur="3.841">bounce it from proxy server to proxy</text>
  <text start="559.67" dur="4.08">server and for them to actually think</text>
  <text start="561.62" dur="4.11">that they can pinpoint this is very very</text>
  <text start="563.75" dur="4.11">difficult and I know they keep saying</text>
  <text start="565.73" dur="4.53">that they narrowed it down they think</text>
  <text start="567.86" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;s China but if you ever notice it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="570.26" dur="4.199">always from China it&amp;#39;s always from</text>
  <text start="572.66" dur="5.67">Russia and it&amp;#39;s always from the Middle</text>
  <text start="574.459" dur="8.401">East it&amp;#39;s always from these locations</text>
  <text start="578.33" dur="7.14">and if you notice they started reporting</text>
  <text start="582.86" dur="5.49">on this just this hasn&amp;#39;t been going back</text>
  <text start="585.47" dur="4.44">years last year but they in the</text>
  <text start="588.35" dur="4.35">beginning they were saying it was the</text>
  <text start="589.91" dur="5.25">Middle East and Iran because they were</text>
  <text start="592.7" dur="5.94">trying to get us into war with Iran but</text>
  <text start="595.16" dur="5.28">now with China and Russia backing Syria</text>
  <text start="598.64" dur="4.319">and Iran they have to bring them into</text>
  <text start="600.44" dur="3.959">the picture and they&amp;#39;re saying some some</text>
  <text start="602.959" dur="4.641">of the tax are even coming from North</text>
  <text start="604.399" dur="6.141">Korea so you can see what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="607.6" dur="5.859">they are getting so desperate now</text>
  <text start="610.54" dur="7.9">because they need to really get</text>
  <text start="613.459" dur="9.301">everything going with wars with the gun</text>
  <text start="618.44" dur="6.99">control with the cyber attacks because</text>
  <text start="622.76" dur="6.24">they have to fit all their pieces to the</text>
  <text start="625.43" dur="6.599">puzzle together so when this economic</text>
  <text start="629" dur="5.55">collapse hits they&amp;#39;re ready they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="632.029" dur="4.531">ready to say the cyber attack hit and it</text>
  <text start="634.55" dur="3.57">gave us this blackout and it&amp;#39;s from this</text>
  <text start="636.56" dur="3.63">country so we need to go to war with</text>
  <text start="638.12" dur="4.05">this country and they&amp;#39;re the ones who</text>
  <text start="640.19" dur="3.99">actually cause the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="642.17" dur="3.539">because they black this out and the</text>
  <text start="644.18" dur="3">bank&amp;#39;s couldn&amp;#39;t do their business and</text>
  <text start="645.709" dur="2.761">they suck the money out of you</text>
  <text start="647.18" dur="3.36">everyone&amp;#39;s account and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="648.47" dur="4.89">there&amp;#39;s no money I mean you can see the</text>
  <text start="650.54" dur="4.799">way this is going to play out we need to</text>
  <text start="653.36" dur="4.5">take your guns away because once the</text>
  <text start="655.339" dur="4.861">Americans find out that this is a</text>
  <text start="657.86" dur="5.82">collapse we can&amp;#39;t have them and those</text>
