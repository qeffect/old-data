  <text start="87.85" dur="5.49">plan is moving forward and everything is</text>
  <text start="90.4" dur="5.1">being put into place to support the plan</text>
  <text start="93.34" dur="4.95">and the plan is not just about</text>
  <text start="95.5" dur="5.7">destroying it&amp;#39;s about rebuilding it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="98.29" dur="6.72">about a rebirth of a nation a rebirth of</text>
  <text start="101.2" dur="5.459">an economic system a rebirth of the</text>
  <text start="105.01" dur="4.64">people controlling the government once</text>
  <text start="106.659" dur="8.061">again and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="109.65" dur="8.47">that transition into that new realm and</text>
  <text start="114.72" dur="5.65">it&amp;#39;s going to take some time this plan</text>
  <text start="118.12" dur="4.109">has been planned for for quite a while</text>
  <text start="120.37" dur="4.109">just it&amp;#39;s not something that came up in</text>
  <text start="122.229" dur="4.951">2016 and said hey let&amp;#39;s start this plan</text>
  <text start="124.479" dur="4.95">the plan was way before Trump came into</text>
  <text start="127.18" dur="4.11">power they were planning on this because</text>
  <text start="129.429" dur="4.2">they knew eventually they were going to</text>
  <text start="131.29" dur="3.509">have to stop what was happening they</text>
  <text start="133.629" dur="3.75">were going to have to stop the deep</text>
  <text start="134.799" dur="6.121">state and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="137.379" dur="6.211">now and we can see that the Chinese were</text>
  <text start="140.92" dur="4.98">involved we can see there were certain</text>
  <text start="143.59" dur="4.14">individuals within our government that</text>
  <text start="145.9" dur="3.089">were involved there were certain</text>
  <text start="147.73" dur="3.3">individuals within government that were</text>
  <text start="148.989" dur="4.291">not elected that were involved we know</text>
  <text start="151.03" dur="3.72">the bankers are involved we know there</text>
  <text start="153.28" dur="4.23">are many individuals that are involved</text>
  <text start="154.75" dur="5.4">and for this plan to move forward we</text>
  <text start="157.51" dur="5.37">need to clean these people out and we</text>
  <text start="160.15" dur="3.72">can start to see with the economy things</text>
  <text start="162.88" dur="2.04">are changing</text>
  <text start="163.87" dur="4.11">Trump control</text>
  <text start="164.92" dur="6.87">the narrative of the economy the central</text>
  <text start="167.98" dur="6.69">bank is controlled by Trump and the</text>
  <text start="171.79" dur="5.31">Patriots right now they are dictating to</text>
  <text start="174.67" dur="5.49">the central bank what they want</text>
  <text start="177.1" dur="6.42">again this was planned on many many</text>
  <text start="180.16" dur="7.41">years ago and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a</text>
  <text start="183.52" dur="7.86">slow and orderly transition to support</text>
  <text start="187.57" dur="8.79">the United States moving forward now we</text>
  <text start="191.38" dur="7.38">are seeing the Chinese they are selling</text>
  <text start="196.36" dur="4.32">their US real estate holdings</text>
  <text start="198.76" dur="3.99">now many people believed and I do</text>
  <text start="200.68" dur="5.18">believe they were using all these real</text>
  <text start="202.75" dur="5.459">estate holdings for money laundering and</text>
  <text start="205.86" dur="5.2">during the good times with the deep</text>
  <text start="208.209" dur="6">state they were pushing their agenda</text>
  <text start="211.06" dur="5.01">Ford because those in China who were</text>
  <text start="214.209" dur="3.541">part of the deep state operation they</text>
  <text start="216.07" dur="2.85">were planning to move everything to</text>
  <text start="217.75" dur="3.87">China they were going to be the next</text>
  <text start="218.92" dur="4.95">powerhouse why do you think certain</text>
  <text start="221.62" dur="5.58">individuals were selling secrets to the</text>
  <text start="223.87" dur="5.339">Chinese because when we entered this war</text>
  <text start="227.2" dur="4.65">that they were going to have they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="229.209" dur="4.5">want the United States to win I have the</text>
  <text start="231.85" dur="3.359">United States didn&amp;#39;t win what could they</text>
  <text start="233.709" dur="3.541">get rid of well then get rid of the</text>
  <text start="235.209" dur="3.901">Constitution they can take control of</text>
  <text start="237.25" dur="4.95">the people and guess what the central</text>
  <text start="239.11" dur="5.33">bankers who lay on top of all this they</text>
  <text start="242.2" dur="4.53">wouldn&amp;#39;t have this problem anymore and</text>
  <text start="244.44" dur="5.92">then they can move forward with their</text>
  <text start="246.73" dur="5.64">mission but that plan is no longer</text>
  <text start="250.36" dur="4.83">moving forward there&amp;#39;s another plan</text>
  <text start="252.37" dur="5.1">moving forward and this is the one by</text>
  <text start="255.19" dur="4.019">the Patriots the Chinese like I said</text>
  <text start="257.47" dur="4.699">they&amp;#39;re selling their real estate</text>
  <text start="259.209" dur="5.161">holdings we know that China&amp;#39;s their</text>
  <text start="262.169" dur="4.661">economic growth is slowing</text>
  <text start="264.37" dur="4.59">we know that Europe their economic</text>
  <text start="266.83" dur="4.73">growth is slowing and we start to</text>
  <text start="268.96" dur="4.68">realize that many of these wealthy</text>
  <text start="271.56" dur="5.44">individuals who were money laundering</text>
  <text start="273.64" dur="5.67">that were buying certain assets they are</text>
  <text start="277" dur="3.6">starting to sell because they realize</text>
  <text start="279.31" dur="3.75">what&amp;#39;s going to happen in the end</text>
  <text start="280.6" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re gonna lose a lot and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="283.06" dur="5.25">starting to see Chinese they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="285.07" dur="6.06">to sell their real estate now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="288.31" dur="5.52">very interesting for us to prepare for</text>
  <text start="291.13" dur="5.52">this transition we understand back in</text>
  <text start="293.83" dur="4.67">the 70s the early 70s 1970-71 and again</text>
  <text start="296.65" dur="3.86">this was planned before 71 came</text>
  <text start="298.5" dur="4.11">about when we came off the gold standard</text>
  <text start="300.51" dur="4.02">we know that Kissinger was involved in</text>
  <text start="302.61" dur="3.93">this where they were moving everything</text>
  <text start="304.53" dur="5.79">from the gold standard and backing it</text>
  <text start="306.54" dur="5.88">via the petro dollar now Trump and the</text>
  <text start="310.32" dur="3.93">Patriots they&amp;#39;re getting rid of the</text>
  <text start="312.42" dur="4.98">petro dollar the plans in the Middle</text>
  <text start="314.25" dur="6.03">East they are coming to an end if that</text>
  <text start="317.4" dur="6.75">comes to an end we will not have the</text>
  <text start="320.28" dur="5.94">same ability that we had before where</text>
  <text start="324.15" dur="4.47">other countries would purchase the oil</text>
  <text start="326.22" dur="4.5">using the dollar and the United States</text>
  <text start="328.62" dur="3.51">would have the benefit of this remember</text>
  <text start="330.72" dur="3.72">when we first came on the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="332.13" dur="4.32">system it was very difficult getting oil</text>
  <text start="334.44" dur="4.65">here in the United States this is</text>
  <text start="336.45" dur="5.04">because of the transition once we&amp;#39;re off</text>
  <text start="339.09" dur="4.95">the petro dollar system we have to be</text>
  <text start="341.49" dur="7.53">energy independent because we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="344.04" dur="8.34">going to have that ability to allow</text>
  <text start="349.02" dur="6.12">countries to purchase oil using the</text>
  <text start="352.38" dur="5.28">dollar and take those dollars and</text>
  <text start="355.14" dur="4.56">purchase American goods it&amp;#39;s just not</text>
  <text start="357.66" dur="5.13">going to work anymore so what is</text>
  <text start="359.7" dur="4.86">happening well we&amp;#39;re starting to see and</text>
  <text start="362.79" dur="3.12">remember the deep state the mainstream</text>
  <text start="364.56" dur="3.78">media been telling us that we have no</text>
  <text start="365.91" dur="3.78">oil here in the United States we need to</text>
  <text start="368.34" dur="3.15">depend on the Middle East we need to</text>
  <text start="369.69" dur="3.12">depend on other countries we need to</text>
  <text start="371.49" dur="4.59">depend on Venezuela we need to depend</text>
  <text start="372.81" dur="5.01">everywhere else but the u.s. is now the</text>
  <text start="376.08" dur="3.66">largest oil producer in the world in</text>
  <text start="377.82" dur="3.93">fact at the end of the next five years</text>
  <text start="379.74" dur="5.58">the US will be producing more in Saudi</text>
  <text start="381.75" dur="5.82">Arabia and Russia combined back in</text>
  <text start="385.32" dur="6">September the u.s. reportedly became the</text>
  <text start="387.57" dur="7.44">world&amp;#39;s largest producer of oil out of</text>
  <text start="391.32" dur="7.23">oil gas and investors they released the</text>
  <text start="395.01" dur="6.27">numbers a week ago and the oil is king</text>
  <text start="398.55" dur="4.5">in the US this is what they said the US</text>
  <text start="401.28" dur="3.54">is on track to produce more crude oil</text>
  <text start="403.05" dur="5.01">liquids from Russia and Saudi Arabia put</text>
  <text start="404.82" dur="5.28">together by 2025 US liquids output is</text>
  <text start="408.06" dur="5.52">expected surpass 24 million barrels per</text>
  <text start="410.1" dur="5.37">day over the next six years the growth</text>
  <text start="413.58" dur="4.649">in the US liquids production will be</text>
  <text start="415.47" dur="5.58">driven by major shale basins such as the</text>
  <text start="418.229" dur="5.791">Permian Basin in parts of Texas and New</text>
  <text start="421.05" dur="5.16">Mexico and President Trump he opened up</text>
  <text start="424.02" dur="4.079">the u.s. for drilling for oil by</text>
  <text start="426.21" dur="4.769">eliminating unnecessary regulations</text>
  <text start="428.099" dur="4.35">hindering drilling at home as a result</text>
  <text start="430.979" dur="3.72">the u.s. is becoming</text>
  <text start="432.449" dur="4.261">and more energy-independent it is a</text>
  <text start="434.699" dur="6.571">miraculous that the u.s. is in the</text>
  <text start="436.71" dur="6.539">situation in only a few years well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="441.27" dur="3.869">not really miraculous it&amp;#39;s not a miracle</text>
  <text start="443.249" dur="5.28">this was planned out</text>
  <text start="445.139" dur="5.7">they knew eventually once we come off</text>
  <text start="448.529" dur="5.341">this petro dollar system we would have</text>
  <text start="450.839" dur="6.33">to have the oil here now</text>
  <text start="453.87" dur="6.449">all of a sudden were able to find a lot</text>
  <text start="457.169" dur="6.42">of oil we know out in Alaska there is</text>
  <text start="460.319" dur="6.361">oil if they&amp;#39;re finding oil wouldn&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="463.589" dur="5.88">think the United States must have gold</text>
  <text start="466.68" dur="5.069">someplace maybe in the national parks</text>
  <text start="469.469" dur="3.6">maybe some other place even though the</text>
  <text start="471.749" dur="2.91">deep state the mainstream media the</text>
  <text start="473.069" dur="3">central banks they&amp;#39;ve been telling us</text>
  <text start="474.659" dur="4.56">that you know there&amp;#39;s hardly any gold</text>
  <text start="476.069" dur="5.701">there&amp;#39;s nothing out there you can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="479.219" dur="3.841">it and we know that Q has said that gold</text>
  <text start="481.77" dur="3.389">will destroy the Fed and everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="483.06" dur="5.25">wondering where is the gold we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="485.159" dur="5.82">think it&amp;#39;s in Fort Knox but again it</text>
  <text start="488.31" dur="4.949">might be someplace else here in the</text>
  <text start="490.979" dur="4.41">United States which eventually they</text>
  <text start="493.259" dur="3.18">would use to destroy the Fed we know</text>
  <text start="495.389" dur="3.21">that Russia and China</text>
  <text start="496.439" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;ve been accumulating a lot of gold</text>
  <text start="498.599" dur="6.57">they are preparing they know that</text>
  <text start="501.599" dur="6.511">eventually and this was known before</text>
  <text start="505.169" dur="6.391">Trump because they were preparing to</text>
  <text start="508.11" dur="6.989">move the entire system over to the east</text>
  <text start="511.56" dur="5.25">and once we had this war once we had</text>
  <text start="515.099" dur="2.97">everything they were they were going to</text>
  <text start="516.81" dur="3.389">need to build confidence and they were</text>
  <text start="518.069" dur="4.59">going to use the gold in China but now</text>
  <text start="520.199" dur="4.681">since Trump and Jinping and I believe</text>
  <text start="522.659" dur="4.261">Putin are all working together I believe</text>
  <text start="524.88" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;re gonna use this gold to destroy</text>
  <text start="526.92" dur="6.09">the central banks now the plan that</text>
  <text start="530.22" dur="6.299">Trump and the Patriots are using it is</text>
  <text start="533.01" dur="5.46">definitely moving forward the Fed has</text>
  <text start="536.519" dur="4.771">been set up think about this for a</text>
  <text start="538.47" dur="5.429">second the labor market has soared back</text>
  <text start="541.29" dur="5.159">in the most recent jobs report now of</text>
  <text start="543.899" dur="5.37">course on the surface we know that this</text>
  <text start="546.449" dur="4.44">drums report looks fantastic but below</text>
  <text start="549.269" dur="3.06">everything we know this is still a</text>
  <text start="550.889" dur="3.75">manipulation of everything but nobody</text>
  <text start="552.329" dur="3.931">can say anything because if they do then</text>
  <text start="554.639" dur="2.76">Trump all all he has to do is say hey</text>
  <text start="556.26" dur="3.509">listen if we go back a couple years</text>
  <text start="557.399" dur="4.5">you&amp;#39;ve been manipulating I&amp;#39;m just using</text>
  <text start="559.769" dur="3.121">the same calculation so that argument is</text>
  <text start="561.899" dur="2.63">not going to work and that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="562.89" dur="3.24">never bring it up</text>
  <text start="564.529" dur="4.061">so the</text>
  <text start="566.13" dur="5.25">labor market right now has roared back</text>
  <text start="568.59" dur="5.1">in the most recent jobs report so what</text>
  <text start="571.38" dur="4.08">should the Fed do unfortunately it</text>
  <text start="573.69" dur="3.33">remains co-op between a rock and a hard</text>
  <text start="575.46" dur="3.09">place because remember the Fed was</text>
  <text start="577.02" dur="4.62">raising interest rates because the</text>
  <text start="578.55" dur="5.43">economy was strong now the economy is</text>
  <text start="581.64" dur="7.38">stronger than ever is just improving</text>
  <text start="583.98" dur="7.53">every single day now for decades elected</text>
  <text start="589.02" dur="5.72">policymakers for the most part have</text>
  <text start="591.51" dur="7.17">respected the independence of the Fed</text>
  <text start="594.74" dur="7.29">but as we know Trump has been</text>
  <text start="598.68" dur="6.69">criticizing two decisions by the Fed</text>
  <text start="602.03" dur="5.65">this threatens its credibility and</text>
  <text start="605.37" dur="3.9">raises a chance that the central bank</text>
  <text start="607.68" dur="3.36">bends to the will of elected</text>
  <text start="609.27" dur="3.08">policymakers think about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="611.04" dur="5.07">happening right now</text>
  <text start="612.35" dur="6.25">it&amp;#39;s bringing up the question of the</text>
  <text start="616.11" dur="4.11">feds credibility well wait a minute</text>
  <text start="618.6" dur="3.26">they were telling us the economy strong</text>
  <text start="620.22" dur="3.96">this is why they&amp;#39;re raising rates and</text>
  <text start="621.86" dur="3.93">that&amp;#39;s why we need to raise rates</text>
  <text start="624.18" dur="4.71">because we need to control inflation</text>

  <text start="725.13" dur="6.75">wrong that the economy didn&amp;#39;t fail Trump</text>
  <text start="728.52" dur="6.68">well his numbers go up he looks</text>
  <text start="731.88" dur="7.37">fantastic then we have the election</text>
  <text start="735.2" dur="7.11">Trump is elected once again</text>
  <text start="739.25" dur="5.98">guess what he can do in his second term</text>
  <text start="742.31" dur="4.09">anything he wants because he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="745.23" dur="3.96">have to be he doesn&amp;#39;t have to worry</text>

  <text start="749.19" dur="6.96">going to see the full force and fury of</text>
  <text start="752.04" dur="6.93">the Patriots again this has all been</text>
  <text start="756.15" dur="5.76">planned out everything needs to be put</text>
  <text start="758.97" dur="5.28">in place first and then the hammer is</text>
  <text start="761.91" dur="4.92">dropped and you can see how everything</text>
  <text start="764.25" dur="3.63">is being put into place right now does</text>
  <text start="766.83" dur="4.05">it mean we&amp;#39;re not going to go through a</text>
  <text start="767.88" dur="4.59">transition now Trump he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="770.88" dur="5.01">transition us most likely in the</text>
  <text start="772.47" dur="5.55">beginning part of his second presidency</text>
  <text start="775.89" dur="3.63">moving forward that&amp;#39;s what I would think</text>
  <text start="778.02" dur="3.42">I&amp;#39;m not making any type of prediction I</text>
  <text start="779.52" dur="4.02">don&amp;#39;t have a crystal ball but if I was</text>
  <text start="781.44" dur="4.74">going to do it that&amp;#39;s when I would do it</text>
  <text start="783.54" dur="5.04">why because in the second half of his</text>
  <text start="786.18" dur="4.95">presidency the economy will start to</text>
  <text start="788.58" dur="4.02">improve and as the economy gets better</text>
  <text start="791.13" dur="3.69">and better very very quickly because</text>
  <text start="792.6" dur="5.19">we&amp;#39;re not working for the central bank</text>
  <text start="794.82" dur="6.33">anymore we&amp;#39;re gonna see major major</text>
  <text start="797.79" dur="4.86">changes changes and once he makes the</text>
  <text start="801.15" dur="3.33">arrest and throws people in prison</text>
  <text start="802.65" dur="5.97">during this period of time guess what</text>
  <text start="804.48" dur="7.65">the next election the next Patriot will</text>
  <text start="808.62" dur="6.48">be in the presidency and deep state and</text>
  <text start="812.13" dur="6">the rest they will have that they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="815.1" dur="5.22">even be able to compete and I believe</text>
  <text start="818.13" dur="4.2">this is what they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="820.32" dur="4.5">towards I believe this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="822.33" dur="3.87">trying to do right now and again it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="824.82" dur="3.48">one piece at a time</text>
  <text start="826.2" dur="4.23">remember drop your expectations drop</text>
  <text start="828.3" dur="4.86">what you think is going to happen drop</text>
  <text start="830.43" dur="3.36">what you want to happen everything has</text>
  <text start="833.16" dur="2.28">been playing</text>
  <text start="833.79" dur="5.64">the deep state again they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="835.44" dur="6.83">counter but they already are prepared</text>
  <text start="839.43" dur="5.93">for these contingencies this is</text>
  <text start="842.27" dur="5.11">incredible military planning at its best</text>
  <text start="845.36" dur="4.18">but again we&amp;#39;re gonna be going through</text>
  <text start="847.38" dur="3.6">this transition where we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="849.54" dur="3.3">bumpy roads things are gonna be a little</text>
  <text start="850.98" dur="5.79">bit tough because we&amp;#39;re coming out of a</text>
  <text start="852.84" dur="6.93">fake economic system moving into a real</text>
  <text start="856.77" dur="6.17">people&amp;#39;s economic system where the</text>
  <text start="859.77" dur="6.96">currency is backed by something not just</text>
  <text start="862.94" dur="7.81">by what the central bank tells us or the</text>
  <text start="866.73" dur="7.08">Full Faith and Credit or by oil sales or</text>
  <text start="870.75" dur="6.18">anything like that we&amp;#39;re gonna enter the</text>
  <text start="873.81" dur="5.61">realm of real money and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="876.93" dur="4.83">see that our money well it goes a lot</text>
  <text start="879.42" dur="5.01">further than it did when we were with</text>
  <text start="881.76" dur="6.05">the central bank now once this happens</text>
  <text start="884.43" dur="5.88">the central bank is kind of screwed</text>
  <text start="887.81" dur="4.78">because once the people get a taste of</text>
  <text start="890.31" dur="4.8">what it&amp;#39;s like without a central bank do</text>
  <text start="892.59" dur="4.62">you really think everyone&amp;#39;s gonna say</text>
  <text start="895.11" dur="4.59">hey let&amp;#39;s bring back the central bank no</text>
  <text start="897.21" dur="5.6">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re not gonna want it ever</text>
  <text start="899.7" dur="6.33">again but as we know as time goes on</text>
  <text start="902.81" dur="5.11">those individuals who want the central</text>
  <text start="906.03" dur="4.17">bank who are part of the central bank</text>
  <text start="907.92" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re gonna make moves but we know</text>
  <text start="910.2" dur="2.76">that this is not going to happen for</text>
  <text start="911.58" dur="4.44">years to come</text>
  <text start="912.96" dur="5.4">but once again we always have to be on</text>
  <text start="916.02" dur="4.89">guard because we know the central bank</text>
  <text start="918.36" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to creep back in to</text>
  <text start="920.91" dur="6.54">the world once again they never give up</text>
  <text start="924.33" dur="5.21">they like control they might they might</text>
  <text start="927.45" dur="4.41">retreat at this time but eventually</text>
  <text start="929.54" dur="5.29">they&amp;#39;ll try to spring back into action</text>
  <text start="931.86" dur="4.95">and I do believe that the Patriots they</text>
  <text start="934.83" dur="4.92">already have plans for this to make sure</text>
  <text start="936.81" dur="6.24">that the people are always educated and</text>
  <text start="939.75" dur="5.75">always understand what the central bank</text>
  <text start="943.05" dur="5.07">actually is and if we continually</text>
  <text start="945.5" dur="5.11">educate our children and their</text>
  <text start="948.12" dur="6">children&amp;#39;s children will always know</text>
  <text start="950.61" dur="6.33">that the central bank is evil it&amp;#39;s bad</text>
  <text start="954.12" dur="5.55">and I believe they have some sort of</text>
  <text start="956.94" dur="4.16">plan to make sure that this never</text>
