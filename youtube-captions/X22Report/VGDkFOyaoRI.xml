  <text start="71.49" dur="3.269">said during this meeting and we&amp;#39;re going</text>

  <text start="78.57" dur="3.75">to go out to the UK and what we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="82.32" dur="6.06">homeownership rates have completely</text>
  <text start="86.04" dur="4.56">fallen the official figures show that</text>
  <text start="88.38" dur="4.86">homeownership rates in Britain have</text>

  <text start="101.159" dur="5.791">to 66 percent and what we&amp;#39;re seeing here</text>
  <text start="104.579" dur="4.981">is that the dream of a stable home is</text>
  <text start="106.95" dur="5.459">drifting further out of reach for almost</text>
  <text start="109.56" dur="4.409">everyone in the UK the Department for</text>
  <text start="112.409" dur="4.411">Communities and Local Government also</text>
  <text start="113.969" dur="5.4">warned that rents are increasing faster</text>
  <text start="116.82" dur="4.799">than average wages and the number of</text>
  <text start="119.369" dur="5.941">homes built has fallen to their lowest</text>
  <text start="121.619" dur="5.551">levels in peacetime since 1920 and again</text>
  <text start="125.31" dur="4.699">we are seeing this happen in many</text>
  <text start="127.17" dur="5.67">countries where prices are going up</text>
  <text start="130.009" dur="4.661">salaries are going down many people</text>
  <text start="132.84" dur="5.91">cannot find work and it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="134.67" dur="6.03">difficult to survive and in my past</text>
  <text start="138.75" dur="2.28">reports I discussed how the people in</text>
  <text start="140.7" dur="2.61">the you</text>
  <text start="141.03" dur="3.21">okay we&amp;#39;re dipping into their savings to</text>
  <text start="143.31" dur="3.18">make ends meet</text>
  <text start="144.24" dur="4.68">going for payday loans to pay for their</text>
  <text start="146.49" dur="4.71">rent and we&amp;#39;re seeing this happen all</text>
  <text start="148.92" dur="4.14">throughout Europe we&amp;#39;re seeing it in the</text>
  <text start="151.2" dur="4.29">UK we&amp;#39;re seeing in the United States and</text>
  <text start="153.06" dur="5.25">it is spreading all over the world and</text>
  <text start="155.49" dur="4.079">it is not getting better it is actually</text>
  <text start="158.31" dur="4.41">getting worse and if you really look</text>
  <text start="159.569" dur="6.931">around most of the countries are in a</text>
  <text start="162.72" dur="5.34">recession slash depression at this time</text>
  <text start="166.5" dur="3.51">I mean if you really think about it</text>
  <text start="168.06" dur="5.49">unemployment in some of these countries</text>
  <text start="170.01" dur="7.229">are around twenty five thirty thirty</text>
  <text start="173.55" dur="6.27">five percent which is a lot more than</text>
  <text start="177.239" dur="4.921">the actual depression unemployment so</text>
  <text start="179.82" dur="5.48">we&amp;#39;re way above that at this point even</text>
  <text start="182.16" dur="6.54">in the u.s. they are looking at</text>
  <text start="185.3" dur="4.54">unemployment around 30 to 37 percent of</text>
  <text start="188.7" dur="3.119">course it all depends on which</text>
  <text start="189.84" dur="4.05">calculation you go with if you go the</text>
  <text start="191.819" dur="4.651">shadow stats where we&amp;#39;re at which is</text>
  <text start="193.89" dur="6.03">shadow stats calm we are approaching the</text>
  <text start="196.47" dur="5.489">30% mark of unemployment if you go with</text>
  <text start="199.92" dur="3.69">this Wall Street exact who figured out</text>
  <text start="201.959" dur="4.861">the unemployment he&amp;#39;s saying it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="203.61" dur="5.25">close to 37 percent but we are way up</text>
  <text start="206.82" dur="3.72">there but again you do not see these</text>
  <text start="208.86" dur="4.92">people standing on bread lines you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="210.54" dur="5.759">see them in public they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="213.78" dur="5.01">taking the homeless people pushing them</text>
  <text start="216.299" dur="5.791">away you need permits like in South</text>
  <text start="218.79" dur="4.979">Carolina to feed the homeless now and it</text>
  <text start="222.09" dur="3.48">is absolutely getting ridiculous because</text>
  <text start="223.769" dur="3.481">they don&amp;#39;t want anyone to see any of</text>
  <text start="225.57" dur="3.389">this and they&amp;#39;re putting everyone on</text>
  <text start="227.25" dur="3.6">food stamps so this way you don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="228.959" dur="3.81">the soup lines and the bread lines and</text>
  <text start="230.85" dur="4.979">things like that but we have a lot of</text>
  <text start="232.769" dur="4.831">people today that are struggling and</text>
  <text start="235.829" dur="3.991">they&amp;#39;re trying to make ends meet and</text>
  <text start="237.6" dur="4.949">it&amp;#39;s getting more and more difficult at</text>
  <text start="239.82" dur="4.8">tot as time goes on and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="242.549" dur="4.141">seeing right now is that the initial</text>
  <text start="244.62" dur="5.16">claims for the past week in the u.s.</text>
  <text start="246.69" dur="4.59">jumped from four by fourteen thousand to</text>
  <text start="249.78" dur="4.59">three hundred and forty-eight thousand</text>
  <text start="251.28" dur="5.79">the highest weekly number in all of 2014</text>
  <text start="254.37" dur="4.14">and the biggest myths of expectations of</text>
  <text start="257.07" dur="5.159">three hundred and thirty five thousand</text>
  <text start="258.51" dur="6.45">in a month so again they&amp;#39;re going to you</text>
  <text start="262.229" dur="5.641">know manipulate they&amp;#39;re going to you</text>
  <text start="264.96" dur="3.93">know help the data here and most likely</text>
  <text start="267.87" dur="2.43">you&amp;#39;ll probably see the unemployment</text>
  <text start="268.89" dur="3.75">rate go down</text>
  <text start="270.3" dur="4.14">and how could that be again all these</text>
  <text start="272.64" dur="4.53">numbers are completely a complete</text>
  <text start="274.44" dur="5.28">illusion they&amp;#39;re fake the economy is not</text>

  <text start="287.79" dur="4.2">going on in the real accomodate economy</text>
  <text start="289.89" dur="4.68">you just keep looking at that stock</text>
  <text start="291.99" dur="4.05">market and that is the indicator of how</text>
  <text start="294.57" dur="3.54">the economy is doing and we know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="296.04" dur="4.59">completely false we know it&amp;#39;s fake we</text>

  <text start="343.11" dur="7.62">don&amp;#39;t see a retailer closing 20 of its</text>
  <text start="347.52" dur="5.88">31 stores the only reason you see this</text>
  <text start="350.73" dur="5.31">is because people are not buying the</text>
  <text start="353.4" dur="5.07">products and they&amp;#39;re laying off thousand</text>
  <text start="356.04" dur="5.25">workers so now we have all of these</text>

  <text start="367.92" dur="5.31">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing this since the start</text>
  <text start="369.81" dur="6.39">of 2014 and it&amp;#39;s only February that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="373.23" dur="5.58">and I&amp;#39;ve talked about this a lot I</text>
  <text start="376.2" dur="6.27">talked about the real estate back in</text>
  <text start="378.81" dur="8.88">September in October in November</text>
  <text start="382.47" dur="8.04">Wells Fargo chase Citibank Bank of</text>
  <text start="387.69" dur="5.04">America they were laying off people in</text>
  <text start="390.51" dur="7.05">their mortgage departments not a hundred</text>
  <text start="392.73" dur="7.47">not 200 thousands 10,000 15,000 20,000</text>
  <text start="397.56" dur="6.39">people because they realize the housing</text>
  <text start="400.2" dur="6.24">market is dead there are no Americans</text>
  <text start="403.95" dur="5.16">can take out mortgages to pay for the</text>
  <text start="406.44" dur="5.61">amount of homes that are on the market</text>
  <text start="409.11" dur="5.1">it can&amp;#39;t be done and right now what</text>
  <text start="412.05" dur="5.25">you&amp;#39;re saying is Wells Fargo is cutting</text>
  <text start="414.21" dur="7.02">more people in the mortgage departments</text>
  <text start="417.3" dur="6.66">about another 700 people last year they</text>
  <text start="421.23" dur="6.57">laid off five thousand three hundred in</text>
  <text start="423.96" dur="4.68">the mortgage departments so you can see</text>
  <text start="427.8" dur="2.85">what is happening they already</text>
  <text start="428.64" dur="4.26">understand what is happening they</text>
  <text start="430.65" dur="5.13">already know that this is this housing</text>
  <text start="432.9" dur="5.34">market was a complete fabrication they</text>
  <text start="435.78" dur="4.44">realize it cannot be sustained so what</text>
  <text start="438.24" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re trimming all</text>
  <text start="440.22" dur="4.89">the fat off of there off of it in their</text>
  <text start="443.49" dur="3.18">company and they&amp;#39;re getting rid of the</text>
  <text start="445.11" dur="3.54">people because they realize that</text>
  <text start="446.67" dur="4.05">mortgage applications are completely</text>
  <text start="448.65" dur="4.8">down the tubes and we don&amp;#39;t need all</text>
  <text start="450.72" dur="7.11">these people again if the housing market</text>
  <text start="453.45" dur="7.62">was really booming and really pushing</text>
  <text start="457.83" dur="7.11">the limits of recovery we would see</text>
  <text start="461.07" dur="5.94">mortgaged apartments expand because more</text>
  <text start="464.94" dur="4.47">people need mortgages more people are</text>
  <text start="467.01" dur="4.83">taking out loans you wouldn&amp;#39;t see them</text>
  <text start="469.41" dur="5.28">contract it makes no sense whatsoever</text>
  <text start="471.84" dur="5.61">but here we are this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="474.69" dur="6.45">seeing and right now and I&amp;#39;ve said this</text>
  <text start="477.45" dur="6.09">many times the smart money is now</text>
  <text start="481.14" dur="5.43">leaving the housing market and what I</text>
  <text start="483.54" dur="5.82">mean by that is the investment hedge</text>
  <text start="486.57" dur="4.71">fund companies that bought all of these</text>
  <text start="489.36" dur="4.59">properties that were and they were</text>
  <text start="491.28" dur="5.16">trying to rent them out to Americans</text>
  <text start="493.95" dur="4.68">they were holding on to them hoping to</text>
  <text start="496.44" dur="4.29">drive the prices up and when the time</text>
  <text start="498.63" dur="5.7">was right they were going to sell them</text>
  <text start="500.73" dur="6.68">to American people who were the youth of</text>
  <text start="504.33" dur="5.04">America of course those boomerang buyers</text>
  <text start="507.41" dur="4.3">which I can&amp;#39;t even believe they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="509.37" dur="5.49">actually trying to convince us of and</text>
  <text start="511.71" dur="5.1">that they were hoping that you know they</text>
  <text start="514.86" dur="4.56">would be able to unload these homes at</text>
  <text start="516.81" dur="4.26">higher prices and make nice private</text>
  <text start="519.42" dur="4.2">profits and basically these are flippers</text>
  <text start="521.07" dur="6.51">and long-term flippers I should say and</text>
  <text start="523.62" dur="7.65">right now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is purchases</text>
  <text start="527.58" dur="6.18">by large institutional investors plunged</text>
  <text start="531.27" dur="5.64">in January from a year ago according to</text>
  <text start="533.76" dur="4.179">Realty tracts and what we&amp;#39;re seeing in</text>
  <text start="536.91" dur="5.909">Jacksonville flow</text>
  <text start="537.939" dur="9.3">a 20% decrease Tampa 48 percent decrease</text>
  <text start="542.819" dur="7.24">Tucson 59 percent decrease Memphis 64</text>
  <text start="547.239" dur="5.43">percent decrease Cape Coral Fort Myers</text>
  <text start="550.059" dur="5.21">Florida 70 percent decrease because</text>
  <text start="552.669" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re all leaving the market</text>
  <text start="555.269" dur="5.23">institutional purchases hit the skids in</text>
  <text start="557.739" dur="4.74">over three quarters of the hundred and</text>
  <text start="560.499" dur="2.73">one metro areas that reel that</text>
  <text start="562.479" dur="4.35">RealtyTrac</text>
  <text start="563.229" dur="5.37">analyzed their share dropping to five</text>
  <text start="566.829" dur="4.26">point two percent overall from seven</text>
  <text start="568.599" dur="4.56">point nine percent in December and from</text>
  <text start="571.089" dur="3.15">eight point two percent in January of</text>
  <text start="573.159" dur="3.69">2013</text>
  <text start="574.239" dur="4.89">and we can see they are completely</text>
  <text start="576.849" dur="4.02">getting out of the market and they</text>
  <text start="579.129" dur="4.17">trying to get rid of all of these</text>
  <text start="580.869" dur="4.86">properties as fast as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="583.299" dur="5.28">because they realize this housing market</text>
  <text start="585.729" dur="5.19">cannot be sustained and this is why you</text>
  <text start="588.579" dur="4.35">see mortgage applications plunging this</text>
  <text start="590.919" dur="4.53">is why you see new home builders the</text>
  <text start="592.929" dur="5.16">foot traffic is slowing this is why you</text>
  <text start="595.449" dur="4.38">see Wells Fargo Citibank Bank of America</text>
  <text start="598.089" dur="2.94">all these mortgage companies and</text>
  <text start="599.829" dur="2.85">mortgage departments laying off</text>
  <text start="601.029" dur="4.14">thousands upon thousands of people</text>
  <text start="602.679" dur="5.52">because the housing market is about to</text>
  <text start="605.169" dur="4.95">collapse and many have anticipated that</text>
  <text start="608.199" dur="4.44">the large institutional investors backed</text>
  <text start="610.119" dur="4.2">by private equity would start winding</text>
  <text start="612.639" dur="4.23">down their purchases of homes to rent</text>
  <text start="614.319" dur="5.04">and the January sales numbers provide</text>
  <text start="616.869" dur="4.88">early evidence this is happening and</text>
  <text start="619.359" dur="4.8">this is coming from Realty Trac</text>
  <text start="621.749" dur="6.52">vice-president Darrin Bloom quest and</text>
  <text start="624.159" dur="6.87">again we see it and the big question is</text>
  <text start="628.269" dur="4.98">who&amp;#39;s going to buy all these properties</text>
  <text start="631.029" dur="4.23">and what we&amp;#39;re going to see is that</text>
  <text start="633.249" dur="5.4">nobody nobody&amp;#39;s going to buy them and</text>
  <text start="635.259" dur="6.23">this is why you see foreclosures surging</text>
  <text start="638.649" dur="5.31">in New York New Jersey California</text>
  <text start="641.489" dur="4.84">because again people have purchased</text>
  <text start="643.959" dur="3.81">these houses at higher prices they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="646.329" dur="3.29">getting laid off from their don&amp;#39;t mean</text>

  <text start="978.85" dur="4.41">wanted to put people in the news rooms</text>
  <text start="980.949" dur="4.051">to to even control it further they want</text>
  <text start="983.26" dur="4.019">to control the Internet and the only way</text>
  <text start="985" dur="5.43">they can control the internet was to</text>
  <text start="987.279" dur="6.56">pretty much have what is called trolls</text>

  <text start="1000.779" dur="4.411">that were those people that were talking</text>
  <text start="1003.06" dur="4.769">and every time you see these trolls on</text>
  <text start="1005.19" dur="4.769">these sites it just proves one thing if</text>
  <text start="1007.829" dur="5.401">they&amp;#39;re trying to discredit these people</text>
  <text start="1009.959" dur="6.901">that means they&amp;#39;re hitting the points</text>
  <text start="1013.23" dur="5.609">and they are hitting a home run and the</text>
  <text start="1016.86" dur="3.69">government is very disturbed about what</text>
  <text start="1018.839" dur="4.381">they&amp;#39;re saying because what they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1025.41" dur="5.419">trolls they actually pay them to do this</text>
  <text start="1028.709" dur="5.97">they actually tell them to do this and</text>
  <text start="1030.829" dur="5.86">again this has come out from the leaked</text>
  <text start="1034.679" dur="5.341">documents from Edward Snowden and</text>
  <text start="1036.689" dur="5.64">there&amp;#39;s two main objectives to all of</text>
  <text start="1040.02" dur="4.529">this one to inject all sorts of false</text>
  <text start="1042.329" dur="4.291">material onto the Internet in order to</text>
  <text start="1044.549" dur="4.651">destroy the reputation of its target</text>
  <text start="1046.62" dur="6.179">number two the use of social sciences</text>
  <text start="1049.2" dur="6.84">and other techniques to discredit those</text>
  <text start="1052.799" dur="5.461">people online and to discredit activism</text>
  <text start="1056.04" dur="4.83">to generate outcomes it considers</text>
  <text start="1058.26" dur="4.62">desirable and the following list of</text>
  <text start="1060.87" dur="5.37">Internet infiltration techniques is as</text>
  <text start="1062.88" dur="6.929">follows infiltration operation ruse</text>

  <text start="1077.11" dur="5.549">yes these trolls or shills are</text>
  <text start="1079.96" dur="5.069">completely real you can see them all</text>
  <text start="1082.659" dur="4.051">over the place whatever the person is</text>
  <text start="1085.029" dur="4.49">saying in the new media alternative</text>
  <text start="1086.71" dur="5.52">media those people always come up with</text>
  <text start="1089.519" dur="6.551">no facts or anything and they can</text>
  <text start="1092.23" dur="6.15">completely always hammer home the</text>
  <text start="1096.07" dur="4.44">opposite of what the person is saying to</text>
  <text start="1098.38" dur="4.529">me and they still use curse words they</text>
  <text start="1100.51" dur="6.69">use other types of techniques to make</text>
  <text start="1102.909" dur="6.601">people believe that the person who is</text>
  <text start="1107.2" dur="4.65">speaking on the news media alt or on the</text>
  <text start="1109.51" dur="4.799">alternative media is completely phony</text>
  <text start="1111.85" dur="4.86">fake they try to discredit him or her</text>
  <text start="1114.309" dur="6.631">and this is what they try to do and</text>
  <text start="1116.71" dur="7.079">again in many cases all of these are</text>
  <text start="1120.94" dur="5.849">just people who are paid to do this so</text>
  <text start="1123.789" dur="4.531">people come to the site they look at it</text>
  <text start="1126.789" dur="3.151">they see what they&amp;#39;re saying and they</text>
  <text start="1128.32" dur="3.51">say oh maybe this person isn&amp;#39;t right</text>
  <text start="1129.94" dur="4.619">maybe and this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1131.83" dur="5.01">do and again this just proves that the</text>
  <text start="1134.559" dur="6.391">government is trying to take control of</text>
  <text start="1136.84" dur="6.36">the internet now in my other reports I</text>
  <text start="1140.95" dur="4.229">said the NSA and all the other spy</text>

  <text start="1172.48" dur="5.4">will cause any more problems the other</text>
  <text start="1175.51" dur="5.549">reason is to blackmail they use it to</text>
  <text start="1177.88" dur="6.029">blackmail people and right now again</text>
  <text start="1181.059" dur="5.37">proof that a Snowden documents have</text>
  <text start="1183.909" dur="4.921">shown that British and American spy</text>

  <text start="1264.549" dur="6.391">now we understand out the Ukraine the</text>
  <text start="1266.859" dur="6.66">whole reason for this was to get Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1270.94" dur="5.13">on the EU system and right now the</text>
  <text start="1273.519" dur="9">Ukraine is talking with the EU and IMF</text>
  <text start="1276.07" dur="10.439">and the top priority is to get the</text>
  <text start="1282.519" dur="8.34">Ukraine on the EU system not for the</text>
  <text start="1286.509" dur="5.64">people of the Ukraine not to have a you</text>
  <text start="1290.859" dur="4.65">know to help the people of the Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1292.149" dur="5.97">but the top priority is to get the</text>
  <text start="1295.509" dur="4.38">country into more debt that&amp;#39;s the top</text>
  <text start="1298.119" dur="5.31">priority because this is what they</text>
  <text start="1299.889" dur="6.57">really wanted and what we&amp;#39;re seeing here</text>
  <text start="1303.429" dur="4.86">is that the new the new Ukrainian</text>

  <text start="1463.21" dur="4.35">by the US and as soon as that was signed</text>
  <text start="1465.58" dur="4.92">I think it was like 24 hours later all</text>
  <text start="1467.56" dur="4.92">hell broke loose and the president of</text>
  <text start="1470.5" dur="5.19">Ukraine had to escape the</text>

  <text start="1475.69" dur="4.26">the wayside and the Russians are saying</text>
  <text start="1477.7" dur="5.64">we had a signed deal you approved it and</text>
  <text start="1479.95" dur="5.849">all this went to pot and we can see what</text>
  <text start="1483.34" dur="5.43">is happening because they&amp;#39;re running out</text>
  <text start="1485.799" dur="5.431">of time and they need this on the EU</text>
  <text start="1488.77" dur="5.97">system to spread the debt but what</text>
  <text start="1491.23" dur="6.63">they&amp;#39;re worried about is that the south</text>
  <text start="1494.74" dur="5.16">and eastern part of the Ukraine which is</text>
  <text start="1497.86" dur="4.68">the production and the strategic</text>
  <text start="1499.9" dur="4.44">location which they really wanted they</text>
  <text start="1502.54" dur="3.03">can&amp;#39;t have that part break off because</text>
  <text start="1504.34" dur="3.06">then they&amp;#39;ll be left with the West and</text>
  <text start="1505.57" dur="3.599">the West just has debt and there is</text>
  <text start="1507.4" dur="3.75">really no production there and they</text>
  <text start="1509.169" dur="4.38">really don&amp;#39;t want it they want the</text>
  <text start="1511.15" dur="4.44">entire Ukraine and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1513.549" dur="4.911">going after Georgia next but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1515.59" dur="5.64">seeing what is happening right now now</text>
  <text start="1518.46" dur="5.2">Russia understands what&amp;#39;s happening they</text>
  <text start="1521.23" dur="4.65">understand the tactics the central</text>
  <text start="1523.66" dur="5.04">bankers use they understand what is</text>
  <text start="1525.88" dur="5.61">going on and they are sending to Russian</text>
  <text start="1528.7" dur="5.25">warships the the Russian warships have</text>
  <text start="1531.49" dur="5.4">entered the Black Sea and they are</text>
  <text start="1533.95" dur="6.06">sitting outside and moving into the port</text>
  <text start="1536.89" dur="6.27">near Crimea because they understand what</text>
  <text start="1540.01" dur="6.74">is going in they also sent a intelligent</text>
  <text start="1543.16" dur="6.269">ship to Cuba and this intelligence ship</text>
  <text start="1546.75" dur="6.46">has electronic eavesdropping equipment</text>
  <text start="1549.429" dur="7.111">and weaponry and this is again in Cuba</text>
  <text start="1553.21" dur="5.64">where their ease dropping on in on the</text>
  <text start="1556.54" dur="4.259">United States so we can see what is</text>
  <text start="1558.85" dur="4.02">happening they have two ships in the</text>
  <text start="1560.799" dur="5.551">Black Sea and they have an intelligence</text>
  <text start="1562.87" dur="5.7">ship in Cuba they are getting prepared</text>
  <text start="1566.35" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re getting ready just in case</text>
  <text start="1568.57" dur="4.32">something else happens because they</text>
  <text start="1571.12" dur="4.47">understand that the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="1572.89" dur="8.43">not going to be satisfied if the Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1575.59" dur="9.12">breaks into - ok now it respects to</text>
  <text start="1581.32" dur="6">China China is making some moves now we</text>
  <text start="1584.71" dur="7.14">understand that two nations I think was</text>
  <text start="1587.32" dur="6.15">a Zimbabwe was starting to change up</text>
  <text start="1591.85" dur="3.51">their reserves remove some of the US</text>
  <text start="1593.47" dur="5.43">dollars take on you one because we</text>
  <text start="1595.36" dur="5.22">understand that in Kenya they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1598.9" dur="4.62">becoming the clearinghouse for the yuan</text>
  <text start="1600.58" dur="5.75">in Africa and right now what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1603.52" dur="6.62">is China is planning an</text>
  <text start="1606.33" dur="6.24">airbase in Zimbabwe they&amp;#39;re going to set</text>
  <text start="1610.14" dur="5.039">up the first Chinese military airbase in</text>
  <text start="1612.57" dur="5.37">Africa and this comes amid increasing</text>
  <text start="1615.179" dur="6.331">bilateral cooperation between Zimbabwe</text>
  <text start="1617.94" dur="6.479">and China and basically what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1621.51" dur="5.85">is China is positioning itself for</text>
  <text start="1624.419" dur="5.431">future uh you could say gum both this</text>
  <text start="1627.36" dur="5.97">diplomacy where its military presence</text>
  <text start="1629.85" dur="7.199">would give it a bargaining power against</text>
  <text start="1633.33" dur="5.9">superpowers like the u.s. so now they</text>
  <text start="1637.049" dur="4.951">are positioning themselves and creating</text>
  <text start="1639.23" dur="6.52">bases and moving their military assets</text>
  <text start="1642" dur="6.69">into Africa because we understand what</text>
  <text start="1645.75" dur="6.84">is happening each one of these countries</text>
  <text start="1648.69" dur="5.91">are getting prepared for war this is why</text>
  <text start="1652.59" dur="3.569">you see the pivot to Asia and the United</text>
  <text start="1654.6" dur="3.48">States and all the other private Western</text>
  <text start="1656.159" dur="4.591">Central Bank countries moving their</text>
  <text start="1658.08" dur="6.18">military assets now we see China moving</text>
  <text start="1660.75" dur="6.38">its military assets and moving them into</text>
  <text start="1664.26" dur="6.48">Africa now</text>
  <text start="1667.13" dur="7">China has also signed a security and</text>
  <text start="1670.74" dur="5.52">defense agreement with dish buddy now</text>
  <text start="1674.13" dur="4.799">dis booty has offered military</text>
  <text start="1676.26" dur="5.49">facilities such as a home to the port to</text>
  <text start="1678.929" dur="3.691">the Chinese Navy now where is the</text>
  <text start="1681.75" dur="3.6">Djibouti</text>
  <text start="1682.62" dur="5.46">that is in the opposite side of Yemen</text>
  <text start="1685.35" dur="4.709">and this is in the Red Sea and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1688.08" dur="5.13">right by the Gulf of Arden and it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1690.059" dur="5.881">the choke point that leads in and out of</text>
  <text start="1693.21" dur="5.429">the Red Sea so we can see we have the</text>
  <text start="1695.94" dur="5.76">Chinese on one side and the US on the</text>
  <text start="1698.639" dur="5.701">other side in Yemen and again they are</text>
  <text start="1701.7" dur="4.68">moving their military assets signing</text>
  <text start="1704.34" dur="4.559">agreements and getting everything</text>
  <text start="1706.38" dur="6.659">prepared for World War three and this is</text>
  <text start="1708.899" dur="7.711">why this is happening happening so what</text>
  <text start="1713.039" dur="8.13">do we have here we have Russia branching</text>
  <text start="1716.61" dur="7.11">out to set up military bases around the</text>
  <text start="1721.169" dur="6.091">world we have China now setting up</text>
  <text start="1723.72" dur="6.6">military bases in Africa and in other</text>
  <text start="1727.26" dur="5.039">parts of the world we have China making</text>
  <text start="1730.32" dur="5.099">agreements with all the countries around</text>
  <text start="1732.299" dur="6.841">the world and to become so that you want</text>
  <text start="1735.419" dur="6.951">to become the next your reserve currency</text>
  <text start="1739.14" dur="5.7">we have the US and Europe and NATO all</text>
  <text start="1742.37" dur="4.809">positioning their military assets all</text>
  <text start="1744.84" dur="5.67">around the world the pivot to Asia the</text>
  <text start="1747.179" dur="8.281">missile shield in Europe the missiles in</text>
  <text start="1750.51" dur="7.56">Guam the new base in Japan and we can</text>
  <text start="1755.46" dur="5.07">see all this taking shape because we</text>
  <text start="1758.07" dur="4.739">have to understand that the central</text>
  <text start="1760.53" dur="5.49">bankers realize again I said this so</text>
  <text start="1762.809" dur="5.37">many times that the dollar is collapsing</text>
  <text start="1766.02" dur="4.409">and they need to get the war started and</text>
  <text start="1768.179" dur="3.99">again they&amp;#39;re trying to get into Iran</text>
  <text start="1770.429" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re trying to get into Syria and</text>
  <text start="1772.169" dur="4.821">right now they&amp;#39;re using the peace talks</text>
  <text start="1774.059" dur="5.281">of nuclear their nuclear reactors and</text>
  <text start="1776.99" dur="4.12">again this is an illusion because the</text>
  <text start="1779.34" dur="3.78">IMF and the other central bankers are</text>
  <text start="1781.11" dur="4.26">trying to infiltrate their banks and try</text>
  <text start="1783.12" dur="3.57">to get their natural resources on the US</text>
  <text start="1785.37" dur="3.39">dollar and that&amp;#39;s why the president is</text>
  <text start="1786.69" dur="4.229">out there saying no even though we</text>
  <text start="1788.76" dur="4.049">release removed some of the sanctions</text>
  <text start="1790.919" dur="4.531">and ease them you cannot do business</text>
  <text start="1792.809" dur="3.961">with Iran yet because if they do we will</text>
  <text start="1795.45" dur="3.9">not be getting a cut of this and will</text>
  <text start="1796.77" dur="5.37">not be built we will not be you will not</text>
  <text start="1799.35" dur="6.54">be using the US dollar to to purchase</text>
  <text start="1802.14" dur="6.21">them the oil and other natural resources</text>
  <text start="1805.89" dur="5.34">so you cannot do this yet and anyone who</text>
  <text start="1808.35" dur="5.97">tries we&amp;#39;re going to come down hard on</text>
  <text start="1811.23" dur="5.61">these people and right now Kerry is</text>
  <text start="1814.32" dur="5.52">saying we must pursue Iran new talks</text>
  <text start="1816.84" dur="4.77">nuke talks before we considering war the</text>
  <text start="1819.84" dur="3.48">United States has an obligation to</text>
  <text start="1821.61" dur="4.29">pursue nuclear negotiations with Iran</text>
  <text start="1823.32" dur="4.5">before it considers going to war with</text>
  <text start="1825.9" dur="6.18">Turan to force it to give up its nuclear</text>
  <text start="1827.82" dur="7.17">activities and again the military action</text>
  <text start="1832.08" dur="5.79">likely if Iran talks fail this is coming</text>
  <text start="1834.99" dur="5.189">from a u.s. spokeswoman and again all</text>
  <text start="1837.87" dur="5.25">these options are still on the table</text>
  <text start="1840.179" dur="5.13">again the Senate is trying to come up</text>
  <text start="1843.12" dur="4.41">with new sanctions on Iran they have a</text>
  <text start="1845.309" dur="3.781">new bill that is created because again</text>
  <text start="1847.53" dur="4.08">they are getting prepared and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1849.09" dur="5.49">getting ready if these talks</text>
  <text start="1851.61" dur="6.72">don&amp;#39;t go forth and we can see that they</text>
  <text start="1854.58" dur="5.46">probably will not Iran is has been</text>
  <text start="1858.33" dur="3.87">saying in the past they don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="1860.04" dur="4.74">anything&amp;#39;s going to happen with these</text>
  <text start="1862.2" dur="4.83">talks and again the u.s. is continually</text>
  <text start="1864.78" dur="4.32">adding more and more things to the p5</text>
  <text start="1867.03" dur="3.87">plus one deal that had nothing to do</text>
  <text start="1869.1" dur="3.48">with it and again they&amp;#39;re probably going</text>
  <text start="1870.9" dur="2.04">to make Iran say you know what this is</text>
  <text start="1872.58" dur="2.16">getting</text>
  <text start="1872.94" dur="4.02">and already you&amp;#39;re asking for a lot more</text>
  <text start="1874.74" dur="4.02">than we agreed on so we&amp;#39;re backing out</text>
  <text start="1876.96" dur="3.51">and of course the us is going to come</text>
  <text start="1878.76" dur="3.51">out there and say listen say they backed</text>
  <text start="1880.47" dur="3.99">out they didn&amp;#39;t want to do it so now we</text>
  <text start="1882.27" dur="3.87">have only one alternative a military</text>
  <text start="1884.46" dur="5.34">strike and we can see how this is all</text>
  <text start="1886.14" dur="5.25">forming at this point now in the past</text>
  <text start="1889.8" dur="4.59">reports I&amp;#39;ve been saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1891.39" dur="5.19">they want to push some type of cyber</text>
  <text start="1894.39" dur="4.95">legislation and this is why we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1896.58" dur="5.55">seeing the buildup of cyber attacks at</text>
