  <text start="53.1" dur="6.41">hi and welcome you listening to the x-22</text>
  <text start="56.699" dur="7.02">report my name is Dave and zip sewed</text>
  <text start="59.51" dur="6.609">1592 a n today&amp;#39;s date is June 14th 2018</text>
  <text start="63.719" dur="4.29">and the tot of the episode is breaking</text>
  <text start="66.119" dur="5.25">down the plan to control the narrative</text>
  <text start="68.009" dur="5.161">when the economy collapses let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="71.369" dur="4.321">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="73.17" dur="5.16">news now we&amp;#39;ve talked about the crypto</text>
  <text start="75.69" dur="5.88">market the blockchain in other reports</text>
  <text start="78.33" dur="7.13">and what has come out is that the SEC</text>
  <text start="81.57" dur="7.499">has seemingly confirmed that aetherium</text>
  <text start="85.46" dur="7.57">theorem trades are not subject to</text>
  <text start="89.069" dur="4.981">federal security laws and basically what</text>
  <text start="93.03" dur="4.07">they&amp;#39;re saying and the reason why</text>
  <text start="94.05" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re telling us that this is not</text>
  <text start="97.1" dur="4.659">subject to federal security laws is</text>
  <text start="99.36" dur="5.16">because a theory am the etherium network</text>
  <text start="101.759" dur="6.211">it is decentralized it&amp;#39;s a decentralized</text>
  <text start="104.52" dur="5.73">structure and they&amp;#39;re saying their</text>
  <text start="107.97" dur="6.149">current offers and sales of ether are</text>
  <text start="110.25" dur="7.77">not security transactions and we could</text>
  <text start="114.119" dur="5.731">see right now if it&amp;#39;s etherium that is</text>
  <text start="118.02" dur="4.11">not a security then other crypto</text>
  <text start="119.85" dur="7.189">currencies are going to fall into the</text>
  <text start="122.13" dur="7.56">same exact category very interesting and</text>
  <text start="127.039" dur="7.57">the key here of course is being that</text>
  <text start="129.69" dur="8.34">ether is decentralized this would maybe</text>
  <text start="134.609" dur="6.061">suggest that Bitcoin or litecoin and the</text>
  <text start="138.03" dur="5.73">rest are not securities even given that</text>
  <text start="140.67" dur="6.48">they&amp;#39;re decentralized actually it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="143.76" dur="6.09">decentralized and the SEC went on to say</text>
  <text start="147.15" dur="7.05">that applying security laws to ether</text>
  <text start="149.85" dur="7.53">adds little value and basically the SEC</text>
  <text start="154.2" dur="4.8">SEC chairman Jay Clayton had said that</text>
  <text start="157.38" dur="3.6">the crypto currencies like Bitcoin are</text>
  <text start="159" dur="4.47">not securities though the agency had not</text>
  <text start="160.98" dur="4.229">defendant Li named any other coins that</text>
  <text start="163.47" dur="4.739">would be deemed currency and not</text>
  <text start="165.209" dur="5.161">securities and we might be heading in</text>
  <text start="168.209" dur="3.84">that direction right now and if you want</text>
  <text start="170.37" dur="3.39">to know more and how to trade through</text>
  <text start="172.049" dur="3.301">this volatile market of crypto</text>
  <text start="173.76" dur="3.539">currencies or you just want to learn</text>

  <text start="180.51" dur="4.59">about crypto currencies or you can enter</text>

  <text start="185.1" dur="3.84">you can watch traders actually trade</text>

  <text start="207.15" dur="3.9">restructure they&amp;#39;re gonna try to make</text>
  <text start="208.83" dur="5.1">the company more profitable and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="211.05" dur="6.03">seeing a lot of companies where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="213.93" dur="6.03">laying off a huge amount of employees</text>
  <text start="217.08" dur="5.19">right now and they&amp;#39;re all talking about</text>
  <text start="219.96" dur="4.41">restructuring they&amp;#39;re saying oh we need</text>
  <text start="222.27" dur="5.25">to cut this and cut that now what that</text>
  <text start="224.37" dur="5.58">tells me is that these companies they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="229.95" dur="5.85">going on and we know what&amp;#39;s going on in</text>
  <text start="232.26" dur="5.79">the economy it is breaking down now what</text>
  <text start="235.8" dur="6.15">we need to understand right now is that</text>
  <text start="238.05" dur="6.3">there&amp;#39;s a huge plan going on to control</text>
  <text start="241.95" dur="4.23">the narrative as this breaks down now</text>
  <text start="244.35" dur="3.86">how do you do this you&amp;#39;re not just gonna</text>
  <text start="246.18" dur="5.01">come out and say hey the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="248.21" dur="4.99">falling apart everyone run to the hills&amp;#39;</text>
  <text start="251.19" dur="5.1">I don&amp;#39;t know what else we&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="253.2" dur="5.4">what you need to do is you need to use</text>
  <text start="256.29" dur="3.99">the system that they&amp;#39;ve been using and</text>
  <text start="258.6" dur="4.02">I&amp;#39;m talking about the central bank the</text>
  <text start="260.28" dur="5.1">establishment and they&amp;#39;ve been modifying</text>
  <text start="262.62" dur="6.15">these statistics for a very long time</text>
  <text start="265.38" dur="4.74">you don&amp;#39;t want to stop that you want to</text>
  <text start="268.77" dur="3.78">continue on with this because remember</text>
  <text start="270.12" dur="4.74">this economy is a central bank economy</text>
  <text start="272.55" dur="4.92">so this is what Trump has been doing and</text>
  <text start="274.86" dur="5.16">the Patriots they&amp;#39;ve been continuing on</text>
  <text start="277.47" dur="3.87">with this illusion now the corporate</text>
  <text start="280.02" dur="3.12">media they&amp;#39;re having a very difficult</text>
  <text start="281.34" dur="3.51">time because they don&amp;#39;t want to give</text>
  <text start="283.14" dur="3.96">credit to the Trump they&amp;#39;d rather give</text>
  <text start="284.85" dur="4.41">it to Obama and they don&amp;#39;t want to say</text>
  <text start="287.1" dur="4.89">the economy&amp;#39;s doing poorly just yet</text>
  <text start="289.26" dur="4.92">because they&amp;#39;re trying to give credit to</text>
  <text start="291.99" dur="4.62">Obama and they don&amp;#39;t want to give it a</text>
  <text start="294.18" dur="4.77">Trump and they&amp;#39;re going back and forth</text>
  <text start="296.61" dur="6.87">in there trying to figure out how to do</text>
  <text start="298.95" dur="7.8">this but the plan is right now is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="303.48" dur="4.95">to get this illusion moving forward to</text>
  <text start="306.75" dur="4.17">make everyone believe that the economy</text>
  <text start="308.43" dur="6.6">is doing well when everything starts to</text>
  <text start="310.92" dur="6.15">go south all you need to do is say okay</text>
  <text start="315.03" dur="2.8">why did this whole thing go south here</text>
  <text start="317.07" dur="3.58">who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="317.83" dur="4.82">blame what happened because we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="320.65" dur="4.29">the lowest unemployment we&amp;#39;ve ever seen</text>
  <text start="322.65" dur="3.1">corporations are making profit GDP</text>
  <text start="324.94" dur="3.48">numbers are good</text>
  <text start="325.75" dur="4.59">what did let&amp;#39;s see who&amp;#39;s controlling the</text>
  <text start="328.42" dur="5.52">economy all right the central bank what</text>
  <text start="330.34" dur="5.28">did they do why all of a sudden did the</text>
  <text start="333.94" dur="3.42">economy fail was because they were</text>
  <text start="335.62" dur="4.32">raising interest rates were they not</text>
  <text start="337.36" dur="5.48">managing the economy well and we can see</text>
  <text start="339.94" dur="6.93">with continuous jobless claims right now</text>
  <text start="342.84" dur="6.61">they are the lowest they&amp;#39;ve ever been in</text>
  <text start="346.87" dur="4.91">45 years we&amp;#39;re at nineteen seventy-three</text>
  <text start="349.45" dur="5.82">numbers right now there are less than</text>
  <text start="351.78" dur="5.32">1.7 million Americans claiming jobless</text>
  <text start="355.27" dur="3.78">benefits now of course this is all</text>
  <text start="357.1" dur="4.5">manipulated to make you think and</text>
  <text start="359.05" dur="5.34">believe that everything is great now</text>
  <text start="361.6" dur="6">during this process where you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="364.39" dur="4.5">to bring the whole system down and you</text>
  <text start="367.6" dur="2.76">don&amp;#39;t want to make it painful for a lot</text>
  <text start="368.89" dur="3.03">of people it&amp;#39;s gonna still be painful</text>
  <text start="370.36" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;re gonna go through a transition</text>
  <text start="371.92" dur="3.72">remember the central bankers they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="374.14" dur="3.57">care when it comes down they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="375.64" dur="4.62">who they hurt they would bring it down</text>
  <text start="377.71" dur="4.71">hard and fast they don&amp;#39;t care the</text>
  <text start="380.26" dur="5.63">establishment does not care whatsoever</text>
  <text start="382.42" dur="8.54">and what they&amp;#39;ve done in the past is</text>
  <text start="385.89" dur="9.1">that they they&amp;#39;ve put a lot of people on</text>
  <text start="390.96" dur="5.98">government programs because they wanted</text>
  <text start="394.99" dur="5.01">everyone dependent on government</text>
  <text start="396.94" dur="5.43">programs and when the whole system came</text>
  <text start="400" dur="6">down everyone would be looking to the</text>
  <text start="402.37" dur="6.93">government well what&amp;#39;s been happening is</text>
  <text start="406" dur="5.67">that food stamp usage in America has</text>
  <text start="409.3" dur="5.28">formed seven point eight percent since</text>
  <text start="411.67" dur="7.32">Trump was elected many people are being</text>
  <text start="414.58" dur="6.87">pushed off the government support so</text>
  <text start="418.99" dur="6.66">fewer Americans are relying on</text>
  <text start="421.45" dur="7.98">government food handouts well that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="425.65" dur="6.39">very interesting because you can&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="429.43" dur="6.72">the people relying on the government</text>
  <text start="432.04" dur="5.61">when the system falls apart because the</text>
  <text start="436.15" dur="4.26">government is not going to be able to</text>
  <text start="437.65" dur="6.15">support them so you might as well have</text>
  <text start="440.41" dur="7.35">people right now try to figure out how</text>
  <text start="443.8" dur="6.39">to get along by themselves and figure</text>
  <text start="447.76" dur="3.57">out how to do this because think about</text>
  <text start="450.19" dur="5.34">this</text>
  <text start="451.33" dur="7.14">if the system completely crashes and it</text>
  <text start="455.53" dur="4.77">falls apart and everyone&amp;#39;s looking</text>
  <text start="458.47" dur="4.289">towards the government what is the</text>
  <text start="460.3" dur="3.81">government going to do nothing then</text>
  <text start="462.759" dur="2.97">you&amp;#39;re gonna have riots and people</text>
  <text start="464.11" dur="3.83">screaming and yelling at the government</text>
  <text start="465.729" dur="4.711">because they&amp;#39;re not being helped if</text>
  <text start="467.94" dur="4.689">people are not relying on the government</text>
  <text start="470.44" dur="4.5">and you&amp;#39;re trying to reduce this number</text>
  <text start="472.629" dur="3.421">because you know a crash is coming well</text>
  <text start="474.94" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re not going to blame the</text>
  <text start="476.05" dur="6">government and this is what is happening</text>
  <text start="478.84" dur="5.34">right now now remember we have the</text>
  <text start="482.05" dur="4.679">illusion being pumped up to control the</text>
  <text start="484.18" dur="4.709">narrative because they have to blame</text>
  <text start="486.729" dur="4.5">someone for this and it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="488.889" dur="6.12">most likely the central banks and they</text>
  <text start="491.229" dur="6.301">need to get everyone off of government</text>
  <text start="495.009" dur="7.44">support now this is not an easy task</text>
  <text start="497.53" dur="8.069">it&amp;#39;s not good for many people but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="502.449" dur="6.93">heading towards a major collapse</text>
  <text start="505.599" dur="7.5">scenario and everything has to be put</text>
  <text start="509.379" dur="6.301">into place to weather the storm as best</text>
  <text start="513.099" dur="5.101">as possible remember the central bank</text>
  <text start="515.68" dur="5.31">the establishment they&amp;#39;ve been running</text>
  <text start="518.2" dur="5.49">this economy for a very long time their</text>
  <text start="520.99" dur="5.13">plan was to get everyone dependent on</text>
  <text start="523.69" dur="4.26">government and this is why Obama always</text>
  <text start="526.12" dur="3.51">came out that it you know wasn&amp;#39;t you who</text>
  <text start="527.95" dur="2.61">built the business it was really the</text>
  <text start="529.63" dur="4.17">government and they were trying to</text>
  <text start="530.56" dur="6.2">convince people of this and now the</text>
  <text start="533.8" dur="7.32">opposite is happening but during this</text>
  <text start="536.76" dur="6.46">gigantic illusionary push to seek to</text>
  <text start="541.12" dur="3.839">make the economy look great they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="543.22" dur="3.39">gonna be putting out statistics like</text>
  <text start="544.959" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;ve never seen before and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="546.61" dur="5.64">a lot of it I mean if we look at retail</text>
  <text start="549.399" dur="5.011">growth now we know retail is not doing</text>
  <text start="552.25" dur="4.56">well and I know there&amp;#39;s headlines out</text>
  <text start="554.41" dur="4.53">there saying retail sales surged in May</text>
  <text start="556.81" dur="3.029">the biggest jump that we&amp;#39;ve seen in a</text>
  <text start="558.94" dur="3.69">very long time</text>
  <text start="559.839" dur="6.11">and we also need to understand is that</text>
  <text start="562.63" dur="7.5">there are many stores that have closed</text>
  <text start="565.949" dur="8.5">fuel prices have gone up and we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="570.13" dur="9.06">something called inflation and inflation</text>
  <text start="574.449" dur="6.411">well that is what is pushing these</text>
  <text start="579.19" dur="4">numbers up</text>
  <text start="580.86" dur="7.02">this is how we can explain all this as</text>
  <text start="583.19" dur="7.51">the dollar loses value people have to</text>
  <text start="587.88" dur="7.68">use more dollars to pay for the same</text>
  <text start="590.7" dur="8.19">exact stuff so when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="595.56" dur="5.97">can see that prices are moving up if we</text>
  <text start="598.89" dur="4.8">look at the CPI prices are moving up</text>
  <text start="601.53" dur="6.36">it&amp;#39;s called inflation which means the</text>
  <text start="603.69" dur="6.15">dollar value is declining so total</text>
  <text start="607.89" dur="4.2">retail sales including food services</text>
  <text start="609.84" dur="4.32">such as restaurants surge by five point</text>
  <text start="612.09" dur="4.32">nine percent in May from a year ago this</text>
  <text start="614.16" dur="4.02">is from the Commerce Department which</text>
  <text start="616.41" dur="4.11">they reported all of this this morning</text>
  <text start="618.18" dur="3.96">retail sales without food services</text>
  <text start="620.52" dur="3.6">jumped six percent to four hundred and</text>
  <text start="622.14" dur="4.74">forty three billion excluding motor</text>
  <text start="624.12" dur="4.17">vehicle and parts retail sales jumped</text>
  <text start="626.88" dur="4.05">six point four percent to three hundred</text>
  <text start="628.29" dur="4.31">ninety nine billion I mean it sounds</text>
  <text start="630.93" dur="6.03">great sounds like everything&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="632.6" dur="6.58">splendidly well and the report also says</text>
  <text start="636.96" dur="4.74">there&amp;#39;s very low employment rising wages</text>
  <text start="639.18" dur="8.82">and tax cuts are prodding Americans to</text>
  <text start="641.7" dur="9.05">spend well let&amp;#39;s look at this inflation</text>
  <text start="648" dur="5.64">measured by the Consumer Price Index</text>
  <text start="650.75" dur="7.06">shed some light on what would happen in</text>
  <text start="653.64" dur="6.27">retail sales today CPI rose two point</text>
  <text start="657.81" dur="4.82">eight percent in May the fastest</text>
  <text start="659.91" dur="4.86">year-over-year since February 2012</text>
  <text start="662.63" dur="4.84">conversely the purchasing power of the</text>
  <text start="664.77" dur="6.93">dollar dropped two point nine three</text>
  <text start="667.47" dur="6.03">percent in May so inflation up two point</text>
  <text start="671.7" dur="3.33">eight percent the purchasing power of</text>
  <text start="673.5" dur="4.37">the dollar down two point nine three</text>
  <text start="675.03" dur="5.55">percent and this is all from a year ago</text>
  <text start="677.87" dur="6.28">this is the fastest drop since November</text>
  <text start="680.58" dur="6.18">2011 the loss of purchasing power of the</text>
  <text start="684.15" dur="5.7">dollar is unevenly distributed over</text>
  <text start="686.76" dur="5.13">various products beyond retail sales the</text>
  <text start="689.85" dur="4.32">purchasing power of the dollar has</text>
  <text start="691.89" dur="4.35">essentially collapsed when it comes to</text>
  <text start="694.17" dur="4.47">buying a home in some of the hot housing</text>
  <text start="696.24" dur="3.75">markets in the US for retail products</text>
  <text start="698.64" dur="3.63">the decline in purchasing power of the</text>
  <text start="699.99" dur="4.92">dollar also varies for example in May it</text>
  <text start="702.27" dur="4.47">took twenty one point eight percent more</text>
  <text start="704.91" dur="4.77">dollars to buy the same amount of</text>
  <text start="706.74" dur="4.62">gasoline as a year ago but retail sales</text>
  <text start="709.68" dur="3.78">of gasoline rose by seventeen point</text>
  <text start="711.36" dur="3.45">seven percent over the same period in</text>
  <text start="713.46" dur="3.93">other categories</text>
  <text start="714.81" dur="4.1">price increase were much smaller so when</text>
  <text start="717.39" dur="4.11">we look at all this</text>
  <text start="718.91" dur="4.36">consumers lost purchasing power it takes</text>
  <text start="721.5" dur="5.76">more dollars to purchase the same item a</text>
  <text start="723.27" dur="7.68">year ago wages got wiped out by eroding</text>
  <text start="727.26" dur="6.72">purchasing power of the dollar so wages</text>
  <text start="730.95" dur="5.1">are declining and the purchasing power</text>
  <text start="733.98" dur="4.95">of the dollar is declining at the same</text>
  <text start="736.05" dur="3.9">time and over the 12 months and when we</text>
  <text start="738.93" dur="4.05">look at the purchasing power of the</text>
  <text start="739.95" dur="6.2">dollar it has dropped considerably I</text>
  <text start="742.98" dur="7.94">mean if we go back prior to 2008 is like</text>
  <text start="746.15" dur="9.43">2007 2006 the dollar index was around 50</text>
  <text start="750.92" dur="7.3">we&amp;#39;re down to almost 39 point five it</text>
  <text start="755.58" dur="6.06">has dropped considerably and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="758.22" dur="5.1">getting better we also see bubbles in</text>
  <text start="761.64" dur="4.23">the economy all over the place we see in</text>
  <text start="763.32" dur="4.55">housing we see it in stocks and when we</text>
  <text start="765.87" dur="4.38">look at the graph we can see that</text>
  <text start="767.87" dur="4.39">housing bubble number two which were in</text>
  <text start="770.25" dur="5.37">right now because the first housing</text>
  <text start="772.26" dur="5.01">bubble was back in 2005 6 7 8 and if we</text>
  <text start="775.62" dur="6.48">look at the housing bubble today and</text>
  <text start="777.27" dur="8.85">we&amp;#39;re looking at 2014 2015 2016 2017</text>
  <text start="782.1" dur="6.51">2018 we just surpassed the housing</text>
  <text start="786.12" dur="5.25">bubble number 1 we&amp;#39;re much much higher</text>
  <text start="788.61" dur="7.92">than that bubble if we look at the S&amp;amp;P</text>
  <text start="791.37" dur="8.91">500 stock index well once again we are</text>
  <text start="796.53" dur="6.57">much higher than we were back in 2008</text>
  <text start="800.28" dur="5.43">when it was bubble back then I mean the</text>
  <text start="803.1" dur="4.2">situation is not getting better we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="805.71" dur="3.39">looking at all these bubbles and you</text>
  <text start="807.3" dur="4.289">know what happens with bubbles they pop</text>
  <text start="809.1" dur="4.92">we can pretend that there&amp;#39;s no bubbles</text>
  <text start="811.589" dur="5.161">that there&amp;#39;s nothing here but we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="814.02" dur="4.92">this in the past every time it reaches a</text>
  <text start="816.75" dur="5.07">certain point the whole thing just comes</text>
  <text start="818.94" dur="5.61">down and we know that this is a problem</text>
  <text start="821.82" dur="4.92">with bubbles the other problem with</text>
  <text start="824.55" dur="5.22">bubbles is that we&amp;#39;ve become dependent</text>
  <text start="826.74" dur="6.24">on them as props holding up a rotten</text>
  <text start="829.77" dur="4.98">corrupt status quo since the economy can</text>
  <text start="832.98" dur="4.2">no longer generate sufficient prosperity</text>
  <text start="834.75" dur="3.89">to go around via actual increases in</text>
  <text start="837.18" dur="4.8">private productivity and efficiency</text>
  <text start="838.64" dur="6.88">those skimming most of the gains rely on</text>
  <text start="841.98" dur="5.64">the wealth effect generated by expanding</text>
  <text start="845.52" dur="3">asset bubbles to create a dreamy</text>
  <text start="847.62" dur="4.5">illusion</text>
  <text start="848.52" dur="5.97">prosperity and where does all this go</text>
  <text start="852.12" dur="6.24">all those people that own assets it goes</text>
  <text start="854.49" dur="5.61">up to where the top 1% the other 99% of</text>
  <text start="858.36" dur="4.14">the people they&amp;#39;re left out in the cold</text>
  <text start="860.1" dur="5.73">and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="862.5" dur="5.94">so breaking down this entire planets to</text>
  <text start="865.83" dur="4.59">keep the illusion alive make everyone</text>
  <text start="868.44" dur="4.19">think that the economy is doing well and</text>
  <text start="870.42" dur="6.359">when everything starts to fall apart</text>
  <text start="872.63" dur="7.47">well we had a great economy what did</text>
  <text start="876.779" dur="5.491">this central bank do to destroy this</text>
  <text start="880.1" dur="4.299">what did they do let&amp;#39;s see they raised</text>
  <text start="882.27" dur="4.17">interest rates we don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="884.399" dur="3.871">they&amp;#39;re doing with the the currency</text>
  <text start="886.44" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re creating where the currency is</text>
  <text start="888.27" dur="7.189">going we have no clue maybe we need to</text>
  <text start="891.51" dur="7.44">find out and you can have the public at</text>
  <text start="895.459" dur="5.891">this point if the government leads in</text>
  <text start="898.95" dur="4.11">this direction to say we should audit</text>
  <text start="901.35" dur="3.929">the central bait because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="903.06" dur="4.86">managing our economy they just destroyed</text>
  <text start="905.279" dur="5.461">the economy when the economy was doing</text>
  <text start="907.92" dur="4.859">very very well remember Obama handed a</text>
  <text start="910.74" dur="5.37">very strong economy off the Trump and</text>
  <text start="912.779" dur="6.211">he&amp;#39;s continuing this as we move forward</text>
  <text start="916.11" dur="5.4">and he&amp;#39;s preparing everything for this</text>
  <text start="918.99" dur="4.74">major transition this is what is</text>
  <text start="921.51" dur="3.87">happening right now this is why we this</text>
  <text start="923.73" dur="4.08">is why we see the tax cuts the tariffs</text>
  <text start="925.38" dur="4.5">all of this is to prop up the system for</text>
  <text start="927.81" dur="4.71">a little bit longer get everything</text>
  <text start="929.88" dur="6.18">aligned and get prepared for a</text>
  <text start="932.52" dur="7.17">transition and that&amp;#39;s where this economy</text>
  <text start="936.06" dur="7.41">is headed and at the same time control</text>
  <text start="939.69" dur="6.149">the narrative and blame this on the</text>
  <text start="943.47" dur="4.53">central bank in the past the central</text>
  <text start="945.839" dur="5.731">bank they blamed it on everybody else</text>
  <text start="948" dur="7.079">because they control the narrative if we</text>
  <text start="951.57" dur="4.5">go back to 1971 who do they blame why</text>
  <text start="955.079" dur="4.351">did we have to come off the gold</text>
  <text start="956.07" dur="5.7">standard they blame speculators who are</text>
  <text start="959.43" dur="5.55">these speculators they blame to other</text>
  <text start="961.77" dur="5.58">countries and this is why we had to come</text>
  <text start="964.98" dur="5.91">off the gold standard this is why the</text>
  <text start="967.35" dur="6.57">central bank had to push their agenda</text>
  <text start="970.89" dur="4.92">because they designed a new system back</text>
  <text start="973.92" dur="3.63">then come off the gold standard going to</text>
  <text start="975.81" dur="3.33">the petrodollar how do we explain this</text>
  <text start="977.55" dur="3.24">we just can&amp;#39;t come out and say we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="979.14" dur="2.73">gonna come off the gold center they had</text>
  <text start="980.79" dur="5.01">to make</text>
  <text start="981.87" dur="6.659">type of scenario to convince the people</text>
  <text start="985.8" dur="5.7">that speculators were hurting the</text>
  <text start="988.529" dur="5.31">economy and we needed to come off the</text>
  <text start="991.5" dur="4.83">gold standard to stop them now that</text>
  <text start="993.839" dur="5.521">that&amp;#39;s not what was happening they</text>
  <text start="996.33" dur="6.56">needed that story this fake news story</text>
  <text start="999.36" dur="7.62">to move us to the petrodollar system and</text>
  <text start="1002.89" dur="6.61">that&amp;#39;s what happened now what are we</text>
  <text start="1006.98" dur="3.81">doing we&amp;#39;re keeping the illusion alive</text>
