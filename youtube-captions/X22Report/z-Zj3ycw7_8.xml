  <text start="105.869" dur="7.871">now it looks like the revised Senate</text>
  <text start="110.229" dur="6.931">health care bill is getting ready to be</text>
  <text start="113.74" dur="5.67">introduced no one has really seen it as</text>
  <text start="117.16" dur="4.86">of yet but there are early indications</text>
  <text start="119.41" dur="5.43">that suggest that it will include a</text>
  <text start="122.02" dur="5.76">version of this amendment from Ted</text>
  <text start="124.84" dur="4.29">senator Ted Cruz and Mike Lee and this</text>
  <text start="127.78" dur="4.26">has become the sticking point in the</text>
  <text start="129.13" dur="4.92">negotiations now what this amendment is</text>
  <text start="132.04" dur="3.93">is that it would allow insurers to sell</text>
  <text start="134.05" dur="4.769">plans that do not meet Obamacare</text>
  <text start="135.97" dur="5.34">regulations if they also sell a plan</text>
  <text start="138.819" dur="5.64">that does not meet those rules called</text>
  <text start="141.31" dur="5.1">the consumer freedom Amendment and again</text>
  <text start="144.459" dur="5.401">whenever they come out with these titles</text>
  <text start="146.41" dur="5.28">it is always the opposite and what this</text>
  <text start="149.86" dur="4.11">does it leaves existing plans on the</text>
  <text start="151.69" dur="4.14">market but it gives new options so that</text>
  <text start="153.97" dur="3.72">people can purchase far more affordable</text>
  <text start="155.83" dur="5.34">health insurance what does that really</text>
  <text start="157.69" dur="5.58">mean that these far more affordable</text>
  <text start="161.17" dur="5.99">health insurance plans they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="163.27" dur="6.36">be scheme skimpier cheaper plans and</text>
  <text start="167.16" dur="4.57">they&amp;#39;re not going to cover much you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="169.63" dur="3.9">going to be paying quite a bit and</text>
  <text start="171.73" dur="3.839">they&amp;#39;re not going to be covering that</text>
  <text start="173.53" dur="3.9">much and yeah they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="175.569" dur="4.261">cheaper instead of you know for a family</text>
  <text start="177.43" dur="5.42">paying whatever 1,400 1,800</text>
  <text start="179.83" dur="6.879">you&amp;#39;ll pay 900 but whatever is in there</text>
  <text start="182.85" dur="6.71">you won&amp;#39;t even be able to use because</text>
  <text start="186.709" dur="5.101">the benefits will not be there the</text>
  <text start="189.56" dur="4.679">deductibles will be high and you&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="191.81" dur="4.08">be paying out now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="194.239" dur="3.241">interesting and I mentioned is yesterday</text>
  <text start="195.89" dur="4.08">that there&amp;#39;s going to be an additional</text>
  <text start="197.48" dur="4.95">seventy billion dollars to help the</text>
  <text start="199.97" dur="5.34">bailout of insurance companies now we</text>
  <text start="202.43" dur="5.22">need to remember already in this fund</text>
  <text start="205.31" dur="5.429">from Obamacare there was a hundred</text>
  <text start="207.65" dur="6.869">billion so now there&amp;#39;s a hundred seventy</text>
  <text start="210.739" dur="7.14">billion to help bail out these insurance</text>
  <text start="214.519" dur="5.731">companies because this plan that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="217.879" dur="4.98">proposing guess what it&amp;#39;s the same as</text>
  <text start="220.25" dur="4.29">the Affordable Care Act I mean the bill</text>
  <text start="222.859" dur="4.171">will no longer repeal two of the</text>
  <text start="224.54" dur="4.529">Affordable Care Act&amp;#39;s tax increases on</text>
  <text start="227.03" dur="4.59">wealthy families and it won&amp;#39;t include a</text>
  <text start="229.069" dur="5.07">new tax break for healthcare executives</text>
  <text start="231.62" dur="6.179">in other words all of this looks exactly</text>
  <text start="234.139" dur="6.841">like Obama care and all they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="237.799" dur="3.72">saying listen we have a cheaper plan</text>
  <text start="240.98" dur="2.789">here</text>
  <text start="241.519" dur="5.28">there&amp;#39;s no benefits really but you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="243.769" dur="5.58">just be paying we increased the amount</text>
  <text start="246.799" dur="4.711">to bail out the insurance companies oh</text>
  <text start="249.349" dur="4.021">and by the way we have forty five</text>
  <text start="251.51" dur="5.25">billion dollars to fight the opioid</text>
  <text start="253.37" dur="7.649">epidemic that&amp;#39;s about it I mean there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="256.76" dur="6.149">not much more to this and again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="261.019" dur="4.83">not doing it for the people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="262.909" dur="5.421">doing it for corporations the health</text>
  <text start="265.849" dur="5.85">insurance companies and other entities</text>
  <text start="268.33" dur="6.61">that&amp;#39;s that now we see this whole thing</text>
  <text start="271.699" dur="5.28">with Donald Trump jr. the corporate</text>
  <text start="274.94" dur="4.05">media they&amp;#39;re still out there trying to</text>
  <text start="276.979" dur="4.861">make heads or tell this trying to push</text>
  <text start="278.99" dur="5.28">this agenda very as far as they possibly</text>
  <text start="281.84" dur="4.98">can but something very interesting now</text>
  <text start="284.27" dur="4.38">Lindsey Graham who is a frequent critic</text>
  <text start="286.82" dur="5.37">of Donald Trump he did say something</text>
  <text start="288.65" dur="5.25">very interesting and when you really sit</text>
  <text start="292.19" dur="4.849">down to think about this it does make</text>
  <text start="293.9" dur="6.12">sense and he said here&amp;#39;s the question</text>
  <text start="297.039" dur="7.091">why would they send the Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="300.02" dur="7.17">to a lady who knew nothing so I want to</text>
  <text start="304.13" dur="4.83">know about that too it&amp;#39;s kind of an odd</text>
  <text start="307.19" dur="4.83">way to suggest that the Russian</text>
  <text start="308.96" dur="5.699">government wants to help by sending you</text>
  <text start="312.02" dur="7.32">somebody that doesn&amp;#39;t have any evidence</text>
  <text start="314.659" dur="5.73">at all and he&amp;#39;s right if the Russian</text>
  <text start="319.34" dur="3.69">government</text>
  <text start="320.389" dur="6.471">like the corporate media the deep state</text>
  <text start="323.03" dur="9.18">like they&amp;#39;re all saying is trying to</text>
  <text start="326.86" dur="7.809">work with the Trump family and they were</text>
  <text start="332.21" dur="5.609">working with them to help him get into</text>
  <text start="334.669" dur="9.06">the presidency why would they send him</text>
  <text start="337.819" dur="9.211">someone that knows absolutely nothing it</text>
  <text start="343.729" dur="7.381">makes no sense she had absolutely no</text>
  <text start="347.03" dur="7.53">information all there was was this</text>
  <text start="351.11" dur="7.41">meeting now we know that she came into</text>
  <text start="354.56" dur="8.34">this country and her visa was denied in</text>
  <text start="358.52" dur="6.03">the beginning but then she was allowed</text>
  <text start="362.9" dur="6.139">into the country which we discussed</text>
  <text start="364.55" dur="9.479">yesterday now who gave her the clearance</text>
  <text start="369.039" dur="6.94">well it was Loretta Lynch&amp;#39;s Justice</text>
  <text start="374.029" dur="7.081">Department and they did it under</text>
  <text start="375.979" dur="7.861">extraordinary circumstances and this was</text>
  <text start="381.11" dur="4.859">turned down in the beginning but then</text>
  <text start="383.84" dur="6.15">they decided well she needs to come in</text>
  <text start="385.969" dur="6.51">here so this revelation means it was the</text>
  <text start="389.99" dur="5.07">Obama Justice Department that enabled</text>
  <text start="392.479" dur="4.981">the newest and most intriguing figure in</text>
  <text start="395.06" dur="4.49">the Russian Trump investigation to enter</text>
  <text start="397.46" dur="5.22">the country without a visa and now</text>
  <text start="399.55" dur="4.66">that&amp;#39;s a discretionary act that the</text>
  <text start="402.68" dur="4.859">statute allows the Attorney General to</text>
  <text start="404.21" dur="6.03">do in extraordinary circumstances so</text>
  <text start="407.539" dur="4.891">what was the deal that they made where</text>
  <text start="410.24" dur="4.95">they said okay you&amp;#39;re denied but if we</text>
  <text start="412.43" dur="6.56">let you in this is what we need you to</text>
  <text start="415.19" dur="5.909">do you can come into the country but</text>
  <text start="418.99" dur="5.32">you&amp;#39;re going to have to make contact</text>
  <text start="421.099" dur="6.961">with Trump jr. say you have information</text>
  <text start="424.31" dur="8.849">we just want the meeting so we can get</text>
  <text start="428.06" dur="8.43">the FISA warrant this is what we want</text>
  <text start="433.159" dur="7.531">you to do and it seems like they made</text>
  <text start="436.49" dur="6.45">some type of deal so just five days</text>
  <text start="440.69" dur="4.71">after the meeting in June of 2016 at</text>
  <text start="442.94" dur="6.269">Trump Tower with Donald Trump jr. Jared</text>
  <text start="445.4" dur="5.579">Kushner Paul Manafort it seems the</text>
  <text start="449.209" dur="4.901">Justice Department they lost track of</text>
  <text start="450.979" dur="5.771">her and we know that she showed up</text>
  <text start="454.11" dur="4.38">in Washington in front of a row of House</text>
  <text start="456.75" dur="4.229">of Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on</text>
  <text start="458.49" dur="5.429">Russian policy she also helped arrange</text>
  <text start="460.979" dur="5.49">an event at the Museum in Washington DC</text>
  <text start="463.919" dur="4.321">where pro-russian supporters showed a</text>
  <text start="466.469" dur="4.141">movie that challenged the underpinnings</text>
  <text start="468.24" dur="5.19">of the u.s. human rights law known as</text>
  <text start="470.61" dur="4.769">the Magnitsky Act and at least five</text>
  <text start="473.43" dur="4.229">congressional staffers and the State</text>
  <text start="475.379" dur="4.141">Department officials intended that movie</text>
  <text start="477.659" dur="5.82">showing we know that she was</text>
  <text start="479.52" dur="6.419">photographed in McCain&amp;#39;s office and we</text>
  <text start="483.479" dur="5.37">need to start to wonder well wait a</text>
  <text start="485.939" dur="5.28">minute who really colluded here it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="488.849" dur="4.201">starting to look like Obama Loretta</text>
  <text start="491.219" dur="5.13">Lynch it&amp;#39;s all the same players once</text>
  <text start="493.05" dur="5.04">again here we are actually as we go</text>
  <text start="496.349" dur="5.16">further and further and deeper and</text>
  <text start="498.09" dur="8.28">deeper into this it shows that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="501.509" dur="7.741">really the Obama administration that was</text>
  <text start="506.37" dur="5.46">colluding setting this up compared to</text>
  <text start="509.25" dur="5.669">what the Trump Organization was doing</text>
  <text start="511.83" dur="6.66">and I think what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="514.919" dur="8.191">is the deep state the corporate media</text>
  <text start="518.49" dur="6.51">they realize Oh since Trump jr. released</text>
  <text start="523.11" dur="4.349">these emails people are looking into all</text>
  <text start="525" dur="4.079">this we don&amp;#39;t have the narrative anymore</text>
  <text start="527.459" dur="3.69">I mean they&amp;#39;re going to continually try</text>
  <text start="529.079" dur="4.971">to push it but now we&amp;#39;re caught in this</text>
  <text start="531.149" dur="5.041">thing and if they start to investigate</text>
  <text start="534.05" dur="5.649">they&amp;#39;re going to figure all this stuff</text>
  <text start="536.19" dur="5.459">out and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="539.699" dur="5.611">the chairman of the Senate Judiciary</text>
  <text start="541.649" dur="6.361">Committee Senator Chuck Grassley he is</text>
  <text start="545.31" dur="3.959">invited from jr. to publicly testify</text>
  <text start="548.01" dur="3.81">about the meeting with the Russian</text>
  <text start="549.269" dur="5.13">lawyer and of course Feinstein she what</text>
  <text start="551.82" dur="5.34">has some questions for Trump jr. also</text>
  <text start="554.399" dur="5.731">and again this didn&amp;#39;t work out too well</text>
  <text start="557.16" dur="4.289">with Comey when he testified now the</text>
  <text start="560.13" dur="2.01">corporate media focus was going to be</text>
  <text start="561.449" dur="3.991">fantastic</text>
  <text start="562.14" dur="6.83">and it didn&amp;#39;t work out that way it was</text>
  <text start="565.44" dur="6.69">basically nothing there actually Trump</text>
  <text start="568.97" dur="6.46">used tactics to make him think that he</text>
  <text start="572.13" dur="4.769">had recordings so call me would kind of</text>
  <text start="575.43" dur="7.019">stick to the truth of what really</text>
  <text start="576.899" dur="6.661">happened well when this comes out people</text>
  <text start="582.449" dur="5.071">are going to start asking a lot of</text>
  <text start="583.56" dur="5.85">questions what did this person come from</text>
  <text start="587.52" dur="3.87">who gave her this information why did</text>
  <text start="589.41" dur="5.01">she say she had the information who did</text>
  <text start="591.39" dur="4.8">she have contacts with and when they</text>
  <text start="594.42" dur="6.33">start looking at this well the whole</text>
  <text start="596.19" dur="6.57">thing is going to be blown wide open now</text>
  <text start="600.75" dur="3.87">we see the US House they&amp;#39;ve introduced a</text>
  <text start="602.76" dur="4.92">new version of the Russian Iran</text>

  <text start="707.84" dur="2.86">don&amp;#39;t you think the rest of the world</text>
  <text start="709.71" dur="3.18">was saying the same thing about the</text>
  <text start="710.7" dur="4.65">United States when they had a base in</text>

  <text start="727.29" dur="5.16">state individuals well they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="730.29" dur="2.61">take over the world and guess what they</text>

  <text start="738.99" dur="6.36">individuals into different areas</text>
  <text start="742.31" dur="5.17">actually what they&amp;#39;re doing this is all</text>
  <text start="745.35" dur="5.79">part of the one belt one Road initiative</text>
  <text start="747.48" dur="7.26">and we can see at this point that</text>
  <text start="751.14" dur="6.81">they&amp;#39;re maneuvering in making economic</text>
  <text start="754.74" dur="6.93">deals not by using force or soldiers or</text>
  <text start="757.95" dur="6.24">terrorism and Russia is actually doing</text>
  <text start="761.67" dur="5.31">the same exact thing now the corporate</text>
  <text start="764.19" dur="5.37">media is out there and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="766.98" dur="8.04">that the United States well we just</text>
  <text start="769.56" dur="8.22">liberated muscle in Iraq well we need to</text>
  <text start="775.02" dur="5.33">go back in time and we need to look at</text>
  <text start="777.78" dur="5.99">what they really mean by liberation</text>
  <text start="780.35" dur="4.78">because when you look at muscle it is</text>
  <text start="783.77" dur="5.31">horrific</text>
  <text start="785.13" dur="9.39">it is a complete and utter disaster</text>
  <text start="789.08" dur="9.22">now remember going back around what June</text>
  <text start="794.52" dur="7.83">2014 the Islamic state cross the Syrian</text>
  <text start="798.3" dur="7.17">border into Iraq and once they were in</text>
  <text start="802.35" dur="6.48">Iraq they went after muscle they went</text>
  <text start="805.47" dur="7.44">after other oil-rich cities they even</text>
  <text start="808.83" dur="8.01">tried to get into Baghdad now the United</text>
  <text start="812.91" dur="5.76">States they knew this was happening of</text>
  <text start="816.84" dur="4.02">course this is their paid mercenary army</text>
  <text start="818.67" dur="5.52">and the Islamic state just so happened</text>
  <text start="820.86" dur="7.74">to have Humvees helicopters tanks</text>
  <text start="824.19" dur="7.2">artillery all from the US now all</text>
  <text start="828.6" dur="4.32">throughout this time the American</text>
  <text start="831.39" dur="6.21">military sat on its hand</text>
  <text start="832.92" dur="8.46">now remember back then Obama was calling</text>
  <text start="837.6" dur="6.33">the shots the Pentagon was not he would</text>
  <text start="841.38" dur="5.31">tell them what targets to hit and what</text>
  <text start="843.93" dur="6.87">moves to make so they were not allowed</text>
  <text start="846.69" dur="7.26">to make a move on the Islamic state so</text>
  <text start="850.8" dur="3.5">they just let the Islamic state spread</text>
  <text start="853.95" dur="4.37">through</text>
  <text start="854.3" dur="5.94">Iraq and Syria and basically what</text>
  <text start="858.32" dur="5.19">happened was they took over all these</text>
  <text start="860.24" dur="5.54">areas and they did nothing until now now</text>
  <text start="863.51" dur="6.63">during this time they dropped around</text>
  <text start="865.78" dur="6.67">84,000 bombs in Iraq and it did</text>
  <text start="870.14" dur="7.59">absolutely nothing actually the Islamic</text>
  <text start="872.45" dur="9.48">state expanded their territory now the</text>
  <text start="877.73" dur="10.23">Iraqi forces they went in and they got</text>
  <text start="881.93" dur="8.76">rid of the Islamic state now Trump madis</text>
  <text start="887.96" dur="6.36">they joined in on the fight they dropped</text>
  <text start="890.69" dur="6.69">a lot of bombs on muscle and basically</text>
  <text start="894.32" dur="7.17">obliterated the entire city I mean it is</text>
  <text start="897.38" dur="6.69">a complete mess and right now there you</text>
  <text start="901.49" dur="5.4">can see that 80% of the west of Mosul</text>
  <text start="904.07" dur="5.21">has been completely destroyed thousands</text>
  <text start="906.89" dur="6.6">upon thousands of people are dead and</text>
  <text start="909.28" dur="6.55">the entire area is decimated so this is</text>
  <text start="913.49" dur="5.43">really not a liberation as a destruction</text>
  <text start="915.83" dur="4.47">of a city and this is the part that</text>
  <text start="918.92" dur="4.11">corporate media is not telling everyone</text>
  <text start="920.3" dur="5.94">is that the Islamic state the paid</text>
  <text start="923.03" dur="7.44">mercenaries they were controlled by the</text>
  <text start="926.24" dur="7.32">deep state they were put into place this</text>
  <text start="930.47" dur="5.97">never had to happen actually if we look</text>
  <text start="933.56" dur="9.6">at all these countries Yemen Sudan</text>
  <text start="936.44" dur="8.79">Somalia Libya Lebanon Iraq Syria the</text>
  <text start="943.16" dur="3.03">deep state has caused so much</text>
  <text start="945.23" dur="4.2">devastation</text>
  <text start="946.19" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;ve created a refugee crisis like</text>
  <text start="949.43" dur="6.51">we&amp;#39;ve never seen since World War two</text>
  <text start="951.2" dur="8.91">this was from these individuals and not</text>
  <text start="955.94" dur="8.31">one person in the United States stopped</text>
  <text start="960.11" dur="8.31">it they all went along with it and they</text>
  <text start="964.25" dur="6.72">all used the 2001 authorization for</text>
  <text start="968.42" dur="5.64">military force even though it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="970.97" dur="6.57">apply to this Congress did absolutely</text>
  <text start="974.06" dur="6.24">nothing to stop this which is</text>
  <text start="977.54" dur="4.68">unbelievable and now they have that bill</text>
  <text start="980.3" dur="4.62">that is being pushed through hopefully</text>
  <text start="982.22" dur="5.88">Congress does pass it where they revoke</text>
  <text start="984.92" dur="6.419">the 2001 for authorization for military</text>
  <text start="988.1" dur="6.78">use will it happen we don&amp;#39;t know but we</text>
  <text start="991.339" dur="6.721">can see today that Trump and macron they</text>
  <text start="994.88" dur="5.25">confirm yes we&amp;#39;re not looking to have</text>
  <text start="998.06" dur="3.509">Assad step down we&amp;#39;re not looking for</text>
  <text start="1000.13" dur="2.43">regime change now it&amp;#39;s not because</text>
  <text start="1001.569" dur="3.871">they&amp;#39;re doing it out of the goodness of</text>
  <text start="1002.56" dur="4.92">their hearts especially macron they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1005.44" dur="6.589">doing it because they realize Russia</text>
  <text start="1007.48" dur="7.979">will protect him Russia will never allow</text>
  <text start="1012.029" dur="4.81">the deep state to have regime change and</text>
  <text start="1015.459" dur="5.791">the coalition forces to have regime</text>
  <text start="1016.839" dur="6.631">change in Syria remember it should be</text>
  <text start="1021.25" dur="5.28">left up to the people if the people want</text>
  <text start="1023.47" dur="6.349">him fine if they don&amp;#39;t that&amp;#39;s their</text>
  <text start="1026.53" dur="5.97">choice it&amp;#39;s not up to the United States</text>
  <text start="1029.819" dur="4.571">so we can see at this point Trump is out</text>
  <text start="1032.5" dur="4.86">there and he&amp;#39;s saying listen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1034.39" dur="4.25">working on a second ceasefire with</text>
  <text start="1037.36" dur="4.229">Russia right now</text>
  <text start="1038.64" dur="5.11">we had one in the south and we want</text>
  <text start="1041.589" dur="5.33">others now the deep state they&amp;#39;re still</text>

  <text start="1046.919" dur="9.37">break apart Syria this is their goal</text>
  <text start="1051.39" dur="7.149">Syria and Russia their goal is to have a</text>
  <text start="1056.289" dur="4.861">united Syria and this is where the</text>
  <text start="1058.539" dur="5.88">problems coming in and we&amp;#39;ll have to see</text>
  <text start="1061.15" dur="5.58">how this plays out because Putin he</text>
  <text start="1064.419" dur="4.5">understands what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="1066.73" dur="3.9">he understands that the United States is</text>
  <text start="1068.919" dur="4.651">setting up all these military bases for</text>
  <text start="1070.63" dur="5.52">the Syrian democratic forces which</text>
  <text start="1073.57" dur="6.96">really means they&amp;#39;re trying to create</text>
  <text start="1076.15" dur="6.269">this area for the Kurd area and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1080.53" dur="4.2">trying to use these bases to do it now</text>
  <text start="1082.419" dur="5.13">Putin understands us he knows this Trump</text>
  <text start="1084.73" dur="5.189">knows this also and I think this is why</text>
  <text start="1087.549" dur="3.601">they&amp;#39;re kind of trying to work together</text>
  <text start="1089.919" dur="2.88">and I know a lot of people think well</text>
  <text start="1091.15" dur="2.94">doesn&amp;#39;t he have full control he&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1092.799" dur="3.24">president could do whatever he wants I</text>
  <text start="1094.09" dur="4.05">mean look what the deep state is doing</text>
  <text start="1096.039" dur="6.12">right now with this Russian collusion</text>
  <text start="1098.14" dur="5.31">and how they can control so many aspects</text>
  <text start="1102.159" dur="4.26">of the government you think they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="1103.45" dur="4.68">wiped out no they&amp;#39;re still there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1106.419" dur="5.281">still in there intertwined in the</text>
  <text start="1108.13" dur="7.38">Pentagon and this is a battle that is</text>
  <text start="1111.7" dur="6.3">continually ongoing and what is</text>
  <text start="1115.51" dur="4.62">happening though is that everything is</text>
  <text start="1118" dur="3.87">starting to shift very very slowly I</text>
  <text start="1120.13" dur="4.11">mean you take two steps back</text>
  <text start="1121.87" dur="5.4">step forward and this continually</text>
  <text start="1124.24" dur="4.319">happens because they don&amp;#39;t want him</text>
  <text start="1127.27" dur="3.27">there he&amp;#39;s not part of the Republican</text>
  <text start="1128.559" dur="6.181">Party he&amp;#39;s not part of the Democratic</text>

  <text start="1140.14" dur="5.55">completely obvious to everyone but you</text>

  <text start="1145.69" dur="8.07">government well they are starting to</text>
  <text start="1150.04" dur="6.83">take control of many areas of the</text>

  <text start="1194.26" dur="4.62">state they want to be a part of this no</text>
  <text start="1195.55" dur="9.06">they were being paid by the intelligence</text>
  <text start="1198.88" dur="9.51">agencies to go fight in this war and now</text>
  <text start="1204.61" dur="6.86">they&amp;#39;re taking names so far 18,000 names</text>
  <text start="1208.39" dur="6.09">like I said they&amp;#39;re verified names and</text>
  <text start="1211.47" dur="6.28">they&amp;#39;re tracking each and every one of</text>
  <text start="1214.48" dur="6.57">these down now they&amp;#39;re also making lists</text>
  <text start="1217.75" dur="5.309">of how they are connected and how they</text>
  <text start="1221.05" dur="6.18">got into this system</text>
  <text start="1223.059" dur="8.101">remember they understand that this was</text>
  <text start="1227.23" dur="7.68">part of the deep state they realize that</text>
  <text start="1231.16" dur="9.03">this was controlled supported and funded</text>
  <text start="1234.91" dur="8.58">by the deep state now can they just come</text>
  <text start="1240.19" dur="6.33">out and say hey everyone the United</text>
  <text start="1243.49" dur="8.75">States we created this paid mercenary</text>
  <text start="1246.52" dur="8.73">army we let them loose in Iraq in Syria</text>
  <text start="1252.24" dur="3.2">we used al Qaeda and other terrorist</text>
  <text start="1255.25" dur="3.279">group</text>
  <text start="1255.44" dur="4.89">oops to take over these countries maybe</text>
  <text start="1258.529" dur="3.811">this would be a good thing maybe this</text>
  <text start="1260.33" dur="3.87">would snap people into reality and</text>
  <text start="1262.34" dur="4.62">people will say well wait a minute but</text>
  <text start="1264.2" dur="4.02">again the corporate media would shut</text>
  <text start="1266.96" dur="4.77">this down how would you get that message</text>
  <text start="1268.22" dur="6.539">out what he would tweet it out see the</text>
  <text start="1271.73" dur="6.51">problem today right now is the corporate</text>
  <text start="1274.759" dur="6.54">media still has that control where</text>
  <text start="1278.24" dur="4.939">they&amp;#39;re controlling what news is out</text>
  <text start="1281.299" dur="4.62">there and what news isn&amp;#39;t out there I</text>
  <text start="1283.179" dur="4.72">mean we have the alternative media but</text>
  <text start="1285.919" dur="4.86">we know that Google we know that YouTube</text>
  <text start="1287.899" dur="6.811">we know that Twitter well they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1290.779" dur="6.5">to suppress all of this so the only</text>
  <text start="1294.71" dur="4.65">voice you hear is the corporate media</text>
  <text start="1297.279" dur="4.211">because they don&amp;#39;t want any other</text>
  <text start="1299.36" dur="3.87">information to get out there this is why</text>
  <text start="1301.49" dur="3.389">it&amp;#39;s so difficult yes you could be</text>
  <text start="1303.23" dur="3.809">listening to me you can be listening to</text>
  <text start="1304.879" dur="3.78">many other individuals saying yes we</text>
  <text start="1307.039" dur="3.031">need to get the word out but when you</text>
  <text start="1308.659" dur="3.26">speak to your neighbor and you speak to</text>
  <text start="1310.07" dur="4.8">your friend you speak to your relatives</text>
  <text start="1311.919" dur="6.1">they don&amp;#39;t hear any of this because when</text>
  <text start="1314.87" dur="5.61">you are in an airport or you&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="1318.019" dur="5.581">shopping center what&amp;#39;s usually playing</text>
  <text start="1320.48" dur="6.77">on the television it&amp;#39;s these corporate</text>
  <text start="1323.6" dur="6.27">media news stations blurting out their</text>
  <text start="1327.25" dur="5.019">propaganda and this is what people are</text>
  <text start="1329.87" dur="4.889">hearing every day you take a cab you</text>
  <text start="1332.269" dur="5.16">take a bus or anything else you still</text>

  <text start="1337.429" dur="5.85">media this is why it&amp;#39;s such a problem I</text>
  <text start="1340.61" dur="4.649">mean more and more people are flocking</text>
  <text start="1343.279" dur="5.37">but they have to go specifically to</text>
  <text start="1345.259" dur="5.64">these areas to listen where the</text>
  <text start="1348.649" dur="5.91">corporate media they&amp;#39;re just everywhere</text>
  <text start="1350.899" dur="5.52">now the alternative media if we were on</text>

  <text start="1356.419" dur="6.89">locations it&amp;#39;d be a different story this</text>
  <text start="1358.639" dur="7.951">is why it is so tough to convince people</text>
  <text start="1363.309" dur="6.281">because once again yes Trump can tweet</text>
  <text start="1366.59" dur="4.919">something out but again the corporate</text>
  <text start="1369.59" dur="5.85">media makes fun of the tweets the</text>
  <text start="1371.509" dur="7.351">corporate media tries to create the</text>
  <text start="1375.44" dur="5.489">illusion and create a new story about</text>
  <text start="1378.86" dur="4.319">what he&amp;#39;s really trying to say and when</text>

  <text start="1391.13" dur="4.169">about when the alternative media started</text>
  <text start="1392.919" dur="4.72">when you would tell someone oh I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="1421.49" dur="5.7">see that things are moving in the right</text>
  <text start="1425.059" dur="3.87">direction yes it&amp;#39;s going to seem like</text>
  <text start="1427.19" dur="3.569">sometimes we&amp;#39;re taking a couple steps</text>

  <text start="1441.08" dur="4.92">because they&amp;#39;re being called out on it</text>
  <text start="1443.179" dur="4.59">by more and more individuals because</text>
  <text start="1446" dur="3.84">these individuals are doing a little bit</text>
  <text start="1447.769" dur="4.41">of research and they&amp;#39;re saying no this</text>
  <text start="1449.84" dur="3.99">is not true this is fake and then if you</text>
