  <text start="103.07" dur="3.93">as they&amp;#39;re looking at the United States</text>
  <text start="104.75" dur="5.1">Europe UK and many other countries</text>
  <text start="107" dur="5.399">they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out why the</text>
  <text start="109.85" dur="4.95">economies are starting to deteriorate</text>
  <text start="112.399" dur="3.961">why aren&amp;#39;t they doing as well as they</text>
  <text start="114.8" dur="4.11">should if we&amp;#39;re in this fantastic</text>
  <text start="116.36" dur="4.649">recovery why are we seeing different</text>
  <text start="118.91" dur="4.379">countries basically implode on</text>
  <text start="121.009" dur="5.31">themselves and why are we seeing retail</text>
  <text start="123.289" dur="5.041">fall apart GDP fall apart and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="126.319" dur="3.901">trying to figure out why all this is</text>
  <text start="128.33" dur="4.14">happening and what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="130.22" dur="3.66">about all of this they always beat</text>
  <text start="132.47" dur="2.82">around the bush and they never go right</text>
  <text start="133.88" dur="2.88">to the heart of the matter that the</text>
  <text start="135.29" dur="3.48">central banks they&amp;#39;re the problem</text>
  <text start="136.76" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re putting countries into a huge</text>
  <text start="138.77" dur="4.56">amount of debt and as you keep piling on</text>
  <text start="141.08" dur="4.53">the debt and asking for austerity guess</text>
  <text start="143.33" dur="5.25">what happens the economy doesn&amp;#39;t do as</text>
  <text start="145.61" dur="4.83">well and when people can&amp;#39;t find jobs it</text>
  <text start="148.58" dur="4.379">makes the situation even worse which</text>
  <text start="150.44" dur="4.89">then leads into decline and retail to</text>
  <text start="152.959" dur="5.161">decline in housing housing decline in</text>
  <text start="155.33" dur="5.61">GDP and it&amp;#39;s just a snowball effect out</text>
  <text start="158.12" dur="6.449">in the UK productivity while that has</text>
  <text start="160.94" dur="5.909">fallen and the economy is lagging right</text>
  <text start="164.569" dur="4.351">now output per hour fell around 0.1</text>
  <text start="166.849" dur="4.081">percent in the three months through June</text>
  <text start="168.92" dur="3.649">and they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out why</text>
  <text start="170.93" dur="4.02">this is all happening why is this</text>
  <text start="172.569" dur="4.121">happening out there and here in the</text>
  <text start="174.95" dur="3.509">United States we can see the same thing</text>
  <text start="176.69" dur="3.84">is happening the economists are trying</text>
  <text start="178.459" dur="6.211">to figure out why is this all happening</text>
  <text start="180.53" dur="6.19">now when we use common sense and we</text>
  <text start="184.67" dur="3.82">track everything day to day</text>
  <text start="186.72" dur="4.16">week to week and we look back over the</text>
  <text start="188.49" dur="5.31">years we can see that slowly but surely</text>
  <text start="190.88" dur="4.99">how the central bankers destroy an</text>
  <text start="193.8" dur="3.48">economy and we&amp;#39;ve been watching the</text>
  <text start="195.87" dur="3.42">economy here in the United States and</text>
  <text start="197.28" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re watching it how on how they</text>
  <text start="199.29" dur="5.28">destroy it and we can see exactly why</text>
  <text start="202.26" dur="6.12">these things are happening right now the</text>
  <text start="204.57" dur="6.41">US consumer comfort that has plunged the</text>
  <text start="208.38" dur="5.1">most in 13 months Americans confidence</text>
  <text start="210.98" dur="4.89">suffered its biggest biggest weekly</text>
  <text start="213.48" dur="5.1">setback in more than a year and people</text>
  <text start="215.87" dur="5.37">are not optimistic about their personal</text>
  <text start="218.58" dur="7.02">finances and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="221.24" dur="6.07">the buying climate is deteriorating</text>
  <text start="225.6" dur="3.45">right now people are looking at the</text>
  <text start="227.31" dur="3.6">economy looking at their funds looking</text>
  <text start="229.05" dur="4.05">at what they have and they&amp;#39;re saying you</text>
  <text start="230.91" dur="4.14">know something we just don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="233.1" dur="3.54">funds to do this right now and</text>
  <text start="235.05" dur="3.93">especially those individuals that are</text>
  <text start="236.64" dur="4.14">losing their jobs now the payroll</text>
  <text start="238.98" dur="4.5">information the unemployment information</text>
  <text start="240.78" dur="4.62">came out and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="243.48" dur="4.77">unemployment numbers they have dropped</text>
  <text start="245.4" dur="4.5">to about 4.2 percent right now again</text>
  <text start="248.25" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;ve been watching this for a very long</text>
  <text start="249.9" dur="5.1">time we know it&amp;#39;s completely manipulated</text>
  <text start="251.88" dur="4.859">and we understand that they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="255" dur="3.6">make the economy look really really good</text>
  <text start="256.739" dur="3.72">before the whole thing falls apart and</text>
  <text start="258.6" dur="5.25">if you look back in time the</text>
  <text start="260.459" dur="8.401">unemployment rate drops the same exact</text>
  <text start="263.85" dur="7.77">way right before a huge major recession</text>
  <text start="268.86" dur="5.34">and this is what we are seeing right now</text>
  <text start="271.62" dur="4.23">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that something</text>
  <text start="274.2" dur="3.33">very interesting happened the</text>
  <text start="275.85" dur="5.52">hospitality sector</text>
  <text start="277.53" dur="5.52">well those jobs they just completely</text>
  <text start="281.37" dur="3.93">imploded they drop by like something</text>
  <text start="283.05" dur="4.02">like a hundred eleven thousand jobs here</text>
  <text start="285.3" dur="4.53">and that is just awful and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="287.07" dur="5.159">trying to explain away why the</text>
  <text start="289.83" dur="4.53">unemployment rate has fallen why things</text>
  <text start="292.229" dur="4.291">are looking good even though the</text>
  <text start="294.36" dur="3.57">hospitality jobs have dropped off</text>
  <text start="296.52" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re saying that we&amp;#39;re getting all</text>
  <text start="297.93" dur="5.04">these full-time jobs and once again</text>
  <text start="300.84" dur="3.84">they are playing with their numb with</text>
  <text start="302.97" dur="4.05">the numbers they&amp;#39;re revising they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="304.68" dur="5.19">making everything look a lot better than</text>
  <text start="307.02" dur="4.74">what it really is today and we can see</text>
  <text start="309.87" dur="3.78">right now when we look at the data and</text>
  <text start="311.76" dur="4.11">we look at what the BLS is throwing out</text>
  <text start="313.65" dur="4.68">there they always go by the u3 number</text>
  <text start="315.87" dur="4.289">and this is seasonally adjusted they go</text>
  <text start="318.33" dur="3.389">back they make a lot of revisions</text>
  <text start="320.159" dur="3.57">and they make it look a lot better than</text>
  <text start="321.719" dur="4.95">it really is but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="323.729" dur="6.78">now is the BLS might have been caught</text>
  <text start="326.669" dur="6.75">fabricating wage data now this is the</text>
  <text start="330.509" dur="6.12">most closely watched statistic in</text>
  <text start="333.419" dur="5.01">today&amp;#39;s payrolls report the BLS reported</text>
  <text start="336.629" dur="4.38">that the annual increase in average</text>
  <text start="338.429" dur="5.97">weekly earnings was a whopping 2.9</text>
  <text start="341.009" dur="5.61">percent above the 2.5 percent expected</text>
  <text start="344.399" dur="5.76">and above the 2.5 percent reported last</text>
  <text start="346.619" dur="4.67">month on the surface this was a great</text>
  <text start="350.159" dur="4.56">number</text>
  <text start="351.289" dur="5.62">the 2.9 percent annual increase whether</text>
  <text start="354.719" dur="4.831">distorted by hurricanes or not was the</text>
  <text start="356.909" dur="6.451">highest since the financial crisis</text>
  <text start="359.55" dur="6.359">however a huge problem emerges when you</text>
  <text start="363.36" dur="5.759">look at this just one month prior at the</text>
  <text start="365.909" dur="6.81">revised August data now andrew zetlen of</text>
  <text start="369.119" dur="5.94">south bay research noted that the total</text>
  <text start="372.719" dur="5.19">private average weekly earnings this</text>
  <text start="375.059" dur="5.28">line posted another solid increase of</text>
  <text start="377.909" dur="4.35">0.2 percent month-over-month an upward</text>
  <text start="380.339" dur="4.62">revision from the previous month 0.1%</text>
  <text start="382.259" dur="5.01">and when you look at the components it</text>
  <text start="384.959" dur="5.55">becomes clear that the BLS fabricated</text>
  <text start="387.269" dur="5.48">the numbers and may simply they might</text>
  <text start="390.509" dur="6.03">they might have just simply hard-coded</text>
  <text start="392.749" dur="6.43">this number into their spreadsheet with</text>
  <text start="396.539" dur="7.17">the intention of goal seeking a specific</text>
  <text start="399.179" dur="6.9">number now what it shows is that whereas</text>
  <text start="403.709" dur="3.66">there are a sequential decline in the</text>
  <text start="406.079" dur="3.21">average weekly earnings for goods</text>
  <text start="407.369" dur="3.81">producing and private servicing</text>
  <text start="409.289" dur="3.69">producing industries which are the only</text>
  <text start="411.179" dur="6.24">two sub components of the total private</text>
  <text start="412.979" dur="6.99">line of negative point 80% and negative</text>
  <text start="417.419" dur="5.22">point one percent the BLS also reported</text>
  <text start="419.969" dur="5.34">that somehow the total of these two</text>
  <text start="422.639" dur="6.39">declines was a point two percent</text>
  <text start="425.309" dur="6.39">increase now when you look at this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="429.029" dur="6.15">impossible because the two sub</text>
  <text start="431.699" dur="6.03">components of the subtotal decline with</text>
  <text start="435.179" dur="6.96">the total increases the math just</text>
  <text start="437.729" dur="7.02">doesn&amp;#39;t work out ands Atlin notes that</text>
  <text start="442.139" dur="4.71">this is completely impossible unless you</text>
  <text start="444.749" dur="5.37">hard-coded something in there to give</text>
  <text start="446.849" dur="5.641">you a specific number and this is what</text>
  <text start="450.119" dur="3.541">they have done now they&amp;#39;ve contacted the</text>
  <text start="452.49" dur="4.02">BLS</text>
  <text start="453.66" dur="5.52">seeking an explanation for the</text>
  <text start="456.51" dur="6.24">fabrication of data now if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="459.18" dur="5.43">fabricating this data you bet that</text>
  <text start="462.75" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re fabricating other data and</text>
  <text start="464.61" dur="6.24">there&amp;#39;s many people out there like John</text>
  <text start="468.42" dur="4.17">from shadow stats where he looks at the</text>
  <text start="470.85" dur="3.57">numbers and does the calculations and</text>
  <text start="472.59" dur="3.33">shows that yeah these numbers are</text>
  <text start="474.42" dur="3.78">manipulated this is the real</text>
  <text start="475.92" dur="5.79">unemployment and we&amp;#39;re north of around</text>
  <text start="478.2" dur="6.63">22% right now we are nowhere near 4.2</text>
  <text start="481.71" dur="4.83">percent again we have to understand how</text>
  <text start="484.83" dur="3.84">they do this they count part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="486.54" dur="3.99">as a full-time job so if somebody has</text>
  <text start="488.67" dur="3.96">two part-time jobs it&amp;#39;s two full-time</text>
  <text start="490.53" dur="3.75">jobs those people have given up and have</text>
  <text start="492.63" dur="3.75">not been on an interview within</text>
  <text start="494.28" dur="3.96">something like four weeks or so it</text>
  <text start="496.38" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re counted as falling off and</text>
  <text start="498.24" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re just not looking and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="499.77" dur="4.38">many other variables that go into this</text>
  <text start="502.11" dur="4.38">that they use to manipulate the data the</text>
  <text start="504.15" dur="4.37">revisions and everything else so we</text>
  <text start="506.49" dur="5.25">could see right now they are completely</text>
  <text start="508.52" dur="6.25">fabricating everything just to keep the</text>
  <text start="511.74" dur="4.95">illusion alive now we can see the</text>
  <text start="514.77" dur="4.74">housing market is falling apart very</text>
  <text start="516.69" dur="6.18">very quickly home sales in the Greater</text>
  <text start="519.51" dur="6.87">Toronto Area they plunge by 35% in</text>
  <text start="522.87" dur="6.45">September compared to a year ago now the</text>
  <text start="526.38" dur="5.52">plunge in volume was pretty much spread</text>
  <text start="529.32" dur="5.97">across all types of homes detached</text>
  <text start="531.9" dur="6.72">houses negative 40% semi detached houses</text>
  <text start="535.29" dur="6.54">negative 30% townhouses negative 34%</text>
  <text start="538.62" dur="5.04">condos negative 27% and when you look at</text>
  <text start="541.83" dur="4.8">this you can see that things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="543.66" dur="5.07">changing because if you use Zolo which</text>
  <text start="546.63" dur="5.52">is a Canadian real estate site they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="548.73" dur="6.9">saying that the housing prices they are</text>
  <text start="552.15" dur="6.3">dropping and the Greater Toronto Area is</text>
  <text start="555.63" dur="7.47">down around 17% from the April peak of</text>
  <text start="558.45" dur="8.01">around 800,000 to 665,000 in September</text>
  <text start="563.1" dur="6.54">why is this happening well we discussed</text>
  <text start="566.46" dur="7.02">this before the flow of Chinese money</text>
  <text start="569.64" dur="6.18">it&amp;#39;s basically fallen off because the</text>
  <text start="573.48" dur="3.81">Chinese are now investing in their belt</text>
  <text start="575.82" dur="3.84">and Road system the Silk Road and</text>
  <text start="577.29" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re taking the companies the</text>
  <text start="579.66" dur="3.78">investment companies and investors and</text>
  <text start="581.43" dur="4.02">telling them to take what you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="583.44" dur="4.11">to invest and invest it in the belton</text>
  <text start="585.45" dur="3.66">Road and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="587.55" dur="4.11">this is going to hurt the real estate</text>
  <text start="589.11" dur="4.47">market remember the individuals in these</text>
  <text start="591.66" dur="3.6">countries they&amp;#39;re sitting on the</text>
  <text start="593.58" dur="4.14">sidelines because many people can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="595.26" dur="5.19">jobs many people don&amp;#39;t make enough to</text>
  <text start="597.72" dur="4.619">pay for these type of homes and this was</text>
  <text start="600.45" dur="3.569">all being done by hedge funds investment</text>
  <text start="602.339" dur="3.841">companies they were being done by</text>
  <text start="604.019" dur="4.651">foreign entities and we can see that</text>
  <text start="606.18" dur="5.55">this is holding true once again because</text>
  <text start="608.67" dur="5.07">as the Chinese pull back their funds we</text>
  <text start="611.73" dur="4.53">can see the housing market is taking a</text>
  <text start="613.74" dur="5.339">hit can you imagine if interest rates</text>
  <text start="616.26" dur="4.829">tick up just a little bit and hedge</text>
  <text start="619.079" dur="3.991">funds and investment companies decide</text>
  <text start="621.089" dur="3.511">you know something we&amp;#39;re not purchasing</text>
  <text start="623.07" dur="3.389">homes what do you think is going to</text>
  <text start="624.6" dur="4.679">happen to the housing market it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="626.459" dur="5.661">to come crashing down now just a couple</text>
  <text start="629.279" dur="5.25">months ago maybe even eight months ago</text>
  <text start="632.12" dur="4">Vancouver Toronto these were like oh</text>
  <text start="634.529" dur="3">look at the houses there it&amp;#39;s never</text>
  <text start="636.12" dur="2.94">coming down the housing market is going</text>
  <text start="637.529" dur="3.271">to continually move up up up and up and</text>
  <text start="639.06" dur="4.86">all of a sudden we see things are</text>
  <text start="640.8" dur="4.95">starting to rapidly fall apart now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="643.92" dur="3.659">also looked at pensions here in the</text>
  <text start="645.75" dur="3.63">United States and we know there&amp;#39;s many</text>
  <text start="647.579" dur="3.961">different areas where they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="649.38" dur="4.53">problems where they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="651.54" dur="4.02">underfunded and we can see right now in</text>
  <text start="653.91" dur="2.94">Illinois there&amp;#39;s a problem we can see</text>
  <text start="655.56" dur="4.56">Kentucky there&amp;#39;s a problem</text>
  <text start="656.85" dur="6.81">and Stanford there&amp;#39;s another problem and</text>
  <text start="660.12" dur="5.88">if we look there&amp;#39;s a map of all the</text>
  <text start="663.66" dur="5.16">different municipalities where there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="666" dur="5.76">going to be major major problems with</text>
  <text start="668.82" dur="5.91">pensions with municipalities maybe going</text>
  <text start="671.76" dur="6.63">bankrupt we see Chicago is a problem</text>
  <text start="674.73" dur="8.27">Houston is a problem we see Baton Rouge</text>
  <text start="678.39" dur="8.759">is a problem Fort Worth Oakland Phoenix</text>
  <text start="683" dur="6.43">Jersey City Pittsburgh I mean these are</text>
  <text start="687.149" dur="4.8">a lot of different areas where there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="689.43" dur="4.83">going to be a huge amount of problems</text>
  <text start="691.949" dur="3.661">now in most of these areas the only way</text>
  <text start="694.26" dur="8.01">you can get around this is maybe to have</text>
  <text start="695.61" dur="8.76">like a 30% tax hike or a 76121 percent</text>
  <text start="702.27" dur="4.98">increase in worker pension contributions</text>
  <text start="704.37" dur="4.98">to fix many of these problems some are</text>
  <text start="707.25" dur="4.68">higher some are lower but we can see</text>
  <text start="709.35" dur="3.419">that they are in a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="711.93" dur="2.76">trouble right now</text>
  <text start="712.769" dur="3.63">and if you&amp;#39;re in one of these areas and</text>
  <text start="714.69" dur="3.45">you&amp;#39;re looking for a pension you might</text>
  <text start="716.399" dur="4.711">want to look into this to see what is</text>
  <text start="718.14" dur="5.46">really going on and do they really</text>
  <text start="721.11" dur="5.25">the funds to pay out over that specific</text>
  <text start="723.6" dur="5.1">period of time now something very</text>
  <text start="726.36" dur="5.25">interesting with the Fed we know that</text>
  <text start="728.7" dur="5.82">the second-in-command Stanley Fischer he</text>
  <text start="731.61" dur="5.67">resigned and he resigned unexpectedly</text>
  <text start="734.52" dur="4.32">from the Federal Reserve and many people</text>
  <text start="737.28" dur="5.16">were scratching their head why did he do</text>
  <text start="738.84" dur="7.38">this at this point in time well when we</text>
  <text start="742.44" dur="6.18">look back in time we can see that there</text>
  <text start="746.22" dur="5.25">were other central bankers that resigned</text>
  <text start="748.62" dur="6.27">right before something hit and Stanley</text>
  <text start="751.47" dur="6.45">Fischer was on Bloomberg TV and he says</text>
  <text start="754.89" dur="5.34">he&amp;#39;s expecting higher inflation which is</text>
  <text start="757.92" dur="4.56">going to hit very very soon he said I</text>
  <text start="760.23" dur="6.6">still believe we will have higher</text>
  <text start="762.48" dur="6.78">inflation now when you look at this and</text>
  <text start="766.83" dur="5.73">you hear what he&amp;#39;s saying you can see</text>
  <text start="769.26" dur="5.13">that we&amp;#39;re heading to that point and we</text>
  <text start="772.56" dur="3.51">discuss inflation before where a lot of</text>
  <text start="774.39" dur="3.18">the Fed houses they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="776.07" dur="2.91">running at two point nine percent three</text>
  <text start="777.57" dur="3.78">percent and we know they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="778.98" dur="4.5">offshoring or putting the inflation and</text>
  <text start="781.35" dur="3.51">stuffing into the stock market the</text>
  <text start="783.48" dur="3.72">college tuitions</text>
  <text start="784.86" dur="4.53">and everything else we see that this is</text>
  <text start="787.2" dur="3.87">going to be major problem now it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="789.39" dur="3.78">really that difficult to connect the</text>
  <text start="791.07" dur="4.59">dots here the last time the US had a</text>
  <text start="793.17" dur="4.47">major inflationary spike was in the 70s</text>
  <text start="795.66" dur="5.28">and the head of the Federal Reserve at</text>
  <text start="797.64" dur="5.91">the time Paul Volcker was fired so it</text>
  <text start="800.94" dur="5.28">looks like Fischer decided I need to</text>
  <text start="803.55" dur="4.98">bail on this because I see much higher</text>
  <text start="806.22" dur="3.66">inflation coming and the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="808.53" dur="3.54">going to be a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="809.88" dur="5.19">disaster and we know that higher</text>
  <text start="812.07" dur="4.65">inflation is headed our way the central</text>
  <text start="815.07" dur="3.3">banks are continually printing money and</text>
  <text start="816.72" dur="3.57">we can see that there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="818.37" dur="4.35">countries out there that are moving away</text>
  <text start="820.29" dur="4.62">from the dollar and once again those</text>
  <text start="822.72" dur="3.69">dollars need a place to go they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="824.91" dur="2.97">to come back to United States we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="826.41" dur="2.91">going to see the devaluation of the</text>
  <text start="827.88" dur="4.2">dollar which means precious metals will</text>
  <text start="829.32" dur="5.1">go up in value we&amp;#39;re gonna see the cost</text>
  <text start="832.08" dur="3.69">of goods go up in value or it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="834.42" dur="3.78">take a lot more dollars to buy those</text>
  <text start="835.77" dur="5.31">goods so we can see that we are headed</text>
  <text start="838.2" dur="6.12">in this direction and those people that</text>
  <text start="841.08" dur="5.67">are jumping ship right now they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="844.32" dur="4.29">it for a specific reason because they</text>
  <text start="846.75" dur="3.75">understand what is coming they already</text>
  <text start="848.61" dur="4.23">know what is coming they can pretend</text>
  <text start="850.5" dur="4.11">that they have no idea but at this point</text>
  <text start="852.84" dur="4.619">we can see that</text>
  <text start="854.61" dur="5.55">the economy is deteriorating very very</text>
  <text start="857.459" dur="4.411">quickly we see the housing market and</text>
  <text start="860.16" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s already starting in Toronto</text>
  <text start="861.87" dur="3.719">Vancouver it&amp;#39;s already starting in</text>
  <text start="863.91" dur="3.21">certain areas in the United States and</text>
  <text start="865.589" dur="3.24">if you go outside of those 20 cities</text>
  <text start="867.12" dur="4.38">that Case Shiller looks at and that the</text>
  <text start="868.829" dur="4.801">Fed pumps up you can see that real</text>
  <text start="871.5" dur="4.26">estate is having a major major problem</text>
  <text start="873.63" dur="4.05">right now and as we move forward this is</text>
  <text start="875.76" dur="4.11">just going to get worse it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="877.68" dur="4.08">to get better and it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what</text>
  <text start="879.87" dur="4.11">the unemployment numbers say because</text>
  <text start="881.76" dur="3.9">when you see many people out of work and</text>
  <text start="883.98" dur="3.03">we know there&amp;#39;s a lot of stores closing</text>
  <text start="885.66" dur="4.38">a lot of people losing their jobs and</text>
  <text start="887.01" dur="5.4">remember when a part-time person loses a</text>
  <text start="890.04" dur="4.35">job they might have been counted as a</text>
  <text start="892.41" dur="3.75">full-time job but if they&amp;#39;re not working</text>
  <text start="894.39" dur="3.27">a certain number of hours and getting a</text>
  <text start="896.16" dur="5.73">certain number of pay they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="897.66" dur="7.47">counted as losing a job so what we see</text>
  <text start="901.89" dur="5.28">here is one gigantic manipulation and we</text>
  <text start="905.13" dur="3.72">can see how they can manipulate the</text>
  <text start="907.17" dur="4.25">entire market and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="908.85" dur="5.01">seeing right now the entire system is</text>
  <text start="911.42" dur="4.51">cracking and falling apart right in</text>
  <text start="913.86" dur="3.84">front of our eyes and this will</text>
  <text start="915.93" dur="3.45">accelerate I know it started out very</text>
  <text start="917.7" dur="3.78">very slow and we first started talking</text>
  <text start="919.38" dur="4.68">about this but we can see how things are</text>
  <text start="921.48" dur="6.69">actually changing right now nothing</text>
  <text start="924.06" dur="6.6">happens overnight the Fed those who are</text>
  <text start="928.17" dur="5.279">in control it takes a very long time to</text>
  <text start="930.66" dur="4.619">pump up an economy they can&amp;#39;t do it in a</text>
  <text start="933.449" dur="3.57">year or two they need to do it very</text>
  <text start="935.279" dur="3.75">slowly they need to build confidence</text>
  <text start="937.019" dur="4.32">they may they need to make people think</text>
  <text start="939.029" dur="4.591">that everything is fine and they do this</text>
  <text start="941.339" dur="4.891">on purpose they&amp;#39;re very patient very</text>
  <text start="943.62" dur="5.24">methodical and once they get to this</text>
  <text start="946.23" dur="4.95">point where everyone is feeling good</text>
  <text start="948.86" dur="4.24">that&amp;#39;s when they pull the rug out from</text>
  <text start="951.18" dur="3.24">under them and this is when everything</text>
  <text start="953.1" dur="2.94">falls apart</text>
  <text start="954.42" dur="3.21">this is why you need to be ready and</text>
  <text start="956.04" dur="3.299">prepared because we&amp;#39;re getting very</text>
  <text start="957.63" dur="3.42">close to that point</text>
