  <text start="32.559" dur="3.781">today&amp;#39;s date is May 26 2014 and the</text>
  <text start="34.84" dur="3.269">title of this episode is Russia and</text>
  <text start="36.34" dur="4.53">China are now working together to</text>
  <text start="38.109" dur="4.591">organize the global D dollarization and</text>
  <text start="40.87" dur="4.17">we can see that China has been making</text>
  <text start="42.7" dur="3.81">deals for many years right now they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="45.04" dur="3.18">been setting up bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="46.51" dur="4.26">agreements with many many countries</text>
  <text start="48.22" dur="4.859">across the world they&amp;#39;ve been setting up</text>
  <text start="50.77" dur="5.94">clearing houses and we can see Russia</text>
  <text start="53.079" dur="6.121">and China have both in purchasing a huge</text>
  <text start="56.71" dur="4.65">amount of gold and of course with this</text>
  <text start="59.2" dur="5.069">Ukraine situation it has now pushed</text>
  <text start="61.36" dur="4.829">Russia into overdrive and creating their</text>
  <text start="64.269" dur="4.74">own payment system or now working with</text>
  <text start="66.189" dur="6.091">Visa MasterCard to bring in the system</text>
  <text start="69.009" dur="4.711">into their country so politics can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="72.28" dur="3.99">play a role in this because Visa</text>
  <text start="73.72" dur="5.31">MasterCard realized they will lose a lot</text>
  <text start="76.27" dur="4.5">of business because of these ridiculous</text>
  <text start="79.03" dur="4.53">sanctions that were placed on</text>
  <text start="80.77" dur="6.209">individuals most of the Russian</text>
  <text start="83.56" dur="6.69">officials have removed their wealth from</text>
  <text start="86.979" dur="4.801">the Western banking system because</text>
  <text start="90.25" dur="5.159">they&amp;#39;re afraid that there are more</text>
  <text start="91.78" dur="6.42">sanctions on the way banks in Russia</text>
  <text start="95.409" dur="5.131">were sanctioned and it wasn&amp;#39;t placed on</text>
  <text start="98.2" dur="6.3">the country itself because that would</text>
  <text start="100.54" dur="6.81">have a boomerang effect with the EU and</text>
  <text start="104.5" dur="5.22">the United States and pretty much the</text>
  <text start="107.35" dur="3.9">economies of both would come crashing</text>
  <text start="109.72" dur="5.579">down because they are just held together</text>
  <text start="111.25" dur="6.84">with glue tape and spit and that&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="115.299" dur="7.981">it so they are working together Russia</text>
  <text start="118.09" dur="8.4">and China to create a reserve system to</text>
  <text start="123.28" dur="6.179">protect themselves they are creating</text>
  <text start="126.49" dur="5.1">this entire system by making deals with</text>
  <text start="129.459" dur="5.06">each other making deals with other</text>
  <text start="131.59" dur="5.969">countries and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="134.519" dur="5.611">Russia has been selling their Treasury</text>
  <text start="137.559" dur="5.481">bonds we can see they&amp;#39;ve been redo</text>
  <text start="140.13" dur="6.06">seeing the reserves in dollar and we can</text>
  <text start="143.04" dur="6.09">see that once China starts to really</text>
  <text start="146.19" dur="4.53">dump its Treasury bonds many countries</text>
  <text start="149.13" dur="2.82">are going to follow now the central</text>
  <text start="150.72" dur="3.09">bankers the United States government is</text>
  <text start="151.95" dur="3.96">not going to let that happen they will</text>
  <text start="153.81" dur="4.86">create some type of an event and this is</text>
  <text start="155.91" dur="5.82">why they are really pushing what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="158.67" dur="5.21">on in Syria Ukraine is falling apart</text>
  <text start="161.73" dur="5.43">they had their puppet regime elections</text>
  <text start="163.88" dur="5.65">they lost most of the country so they</text>
  <text start="167.16" dur="4.59">are concentrating right now on Syria and</text>
  <text start="169.53" dur="4.44">it seems like they are preparing for</text>
  <text start="171.75" dur="4.2">some major event and we understand the</text>
  <text start="173.97" dur="5.64">elections are going to happen on June</text>
  <text start="175.95" dur="5.88">3rd in Syria so what did they do what do</text>
  <text start="179.61" dur="6.18">they do well they decided to have a</text>
  <text start="181.83" dur="7.32">military exercise during this timeframe</text>
  <text start="185.79" dur="5.19">from May 25th to June 8th is it a</text>
  <text start="189.15" dur="3.99">coincidence I don&amp;#39;t think so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="190.98" dur="3.39">believe in coincidences I believe this</text>
  <text start="193.14" dur="3.39">was completely planned</text>
  <text start="194.37" dur="4.77">there are thousands upon thousands of</text>
  <text start="196.53" dur="5.46">soldiers in this area they are bringing</text>
  <text start="199.14" dur="5.96">in more advanced weapons we see other</text>
  <text start="201.99" dur="6.87">countries are all joining with this</text>
  <text start="205.1" dur="6.76">exercise and this is definitely a push</text>
  <text start="208.86" dur="5.34">to create some type of an event to go</text>
  <text start="211.86" dur="4.92">into Syria we saw the same build up</text>
  <text start="214.2" dur="6.09">during the August of 2013</text>
  <text start="216.78" dur="5.49">false flag event on Syria and again</text>
  <text start="220.29" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re using the chlorine chemical</text>
  <text start="222.27" dur="5.88">attacks blaming it on Assad keeping the</text>
  <text start="226.05" dur="4.89">chemical weapons within the country so</text>
  <text start="228.15" dur="5.43">they can&amp;#39;t get them out the corporate</text>
  <text start="230.94" dur="5.76">media is letting us know that Assad has</text>
  <text start="233.58" dur="5.79">been hiding weapons biological chemical</text>
  <text start="236.7" dur="4.47">and we can see right now is they put</text>
  <text start="239.37" dur="4.62">everything into place they removed the</text>
  <text start="241.17" dur="4.53">government officials in Syria out of the</text>
  <text start="243.99" dur="3.57">embassies in the United States they told</text>
  <text start="245.7" dur="4.2">them all to leave they brought in the</text>
  <text start="247.56" dur="5.55">opposition and said you are we are you</text>
  <text start="249.9" dur="5.82">are now the liaison the the future</text>
  <text start="253.11" dur="5.46">government of Syria the President Obama</text>
  <text start="255.72" dur="5.61">was out there saying Assad has no future</text>
  <text start="258.57" dur="5.19">whatsoever in his own country again this</text>
  <text start="261.33" dur="4.11">is a sovereign nation and he&amp;#39;s out there</text>
  <text start="263.76" dur="4.59">saying that he has no future whatsoever</text>
  <text start="265.44" dur="5.64">so we can see this is a complete buildup</text>
  <text start="268.35" dur="3.59">they are preparing some type of an event</text>
  <text start="271.08" dur="2.48">we</text>
  <text start="271.94" dur="4.26">to understand that the economy is</text>

  <text start="832.01" dur="5.79">whole point of free speech but they want</text>
  <text start="834.56" dur="6.18">to take it away of course what it says</text>
  <text start="837.8" dur="5.58">is that politicians in Washington have</text>
  <text start="840.74" dur="4.35">unlimited constitutional authority to</text>

  <text start="845.09" dur="4.77">you&amp;#39;re saying things the government</text>
  <text start="847.76" dur="4.8">finds inconvenient and this is coming</text>
  <text start="849.86" dur="4.41">from Ted Cruz so we can see what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="852.56" dur="3.39">trying to do they&amp;#39;re trying to limit</text>
  <text start="854.27" dur="2.67">what people are saying they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="855.95" dur="2.58">it on the Internet</text>
  <text start="856.94" dur="4.44">they don&amp;#39;t want it anywhere they only</text>
  <text start="858.53" dur="4.89">want you to hear what they want to say</text>
  <text start="861.38" dur="5.09">and you can&amp;#39;t criticize them but again</text>
  <text start="863.42" dur="6.72">this is what our founding fathers</text>
  <text start="866.47" dur="5.74">created for the people the people have</text>
  <text start="870.14" dur="5.7">the right to criticize their government</text>
  <text start="872.21" dur="6.84">because these are the servants of the</text>
  <text start="875.84" dur="5.34">people we do not serve them they serve</text>
  <text start="879.05" dur="5.94">us if we don&amp;#39;t like what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="881.18" dur="6.69">we remove them by a crowd of people</text>
  <text start="884.99" dur="5.13">saying you need to leave you need to</text>
  <text start="887.87" dur="4.29">resign and this is what you need to do</text>
  <text start="890.12" dur="2.58">now of course government doesn&amp;#39;t like to</text>
  <text start="892.16" dur="2.52">do that</text>
  <text start="892.7" dur="3.81">they like to keep their power they love</text>
  <text start="894.68" dur="3.42">their power they love their authority</text>
  <text start="896.51" dur="3.6">and they never want to leave so what</text>
  <text start="898.1" dur="3.72">happens is they come down on those</text>
  <text start="900.11" dur="4.68">people with force they usually bring out</text>
  <text start="901.82" dur="4.77">the military or in this case DHS because</text>
  <text start="904.79" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s created for to come</text>
  <text start="906.59" dur="4.83">down on the people and this is why our</text>
  <text start="908.12" dur="5.04">founding fathers said every person has</text>
  <text start="911.42" dur="3.42">the right to bear arms because the</text>
  <text start="913.16" dur="4.14">people need a way to defend themselves</text>
  <text start="914.84" dur="5.01">and say no you&amp;#39;re going to listen to us</text>
  <text start="917.3" dur="4.59">you are going to resign and we can see</text>
  <text start="919.85" dur="4.95">how this is all starting to take place</text>
  <text start="921.89" dur="5.13">now now we see what&amp;#39;s happening out in</text>
  <text start="924.8" dur="4.38">Santa Barbara we saw what happened there</text>
  <text start="927.02" dur="4.59">is a mass shooting of course this mass</text>

  <text start="931.61" dur="6.279">shot three people and again this is the</text>
  <text start="935.24" dur="5.289">same typical mass shooting</text>
  <text start="937.889" dur="4.47">that we&amp;#39;ve seen over and over again</text>
  <text start="940.529" dur="4.321">witnesses are out there saying that</text>
  <text start="942.359" dur="4.77">there was another person in the car who</text>
  <text start="944.85" dur="5.12">was shooting we can see this person has</text>
  <text start="947.129" dur="5.31">psychological problems he was on drugs</text>
  <text start="949.97" dur="5.44">trying to control if he was being seen</text>
  <text start="952.439" dur="5.851">by three different doctors and of course</text>
  <text start="955.41" dur="5.07">all this evidence was left behind so</text>
  <text start="958.29" dur="6.239">everyone could see it and now what do we</text>

  <text start="1521.76" dur="7.58">these bail-in documents it was done on</text>
  <text start="1524.52" dur="8.04">purpose now of course as we know</text>
  <text start="1529.34" dur="5.26">elections are going on in Ukraine and we</text>
  <text start="1532.56" dur="5.94">know that the people that are running</text>
  <text start="1534.6" dur="5.85">for these elections are picked by the</text>
  <text start="1538.5" dur="3.54">puppet regime by the United I mean by</text>
  <text start="1540.45" dur="3.36">the United States central bankers and</text>

  <text start="1545.31" dur="4.47">and you can tell that nothing&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1548.07" dur="5.25">change because they always normally</text>
  <text start="1549.78" dur="6.69">leave those people in power just like</text>
  <text start="1553.32" dur="4.8">when a new president comes into power in</text>
  <text start="1556.47" dur="3.42">the United States they don&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="1558.12" dur="4.62">changes really to the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="1559.89" dur="6.45">they usually keep those people in power</text>
  <text start="1562.74" dur="6.84">because and in other positions they only</text>
  <text start="1566.34" dur="5.43">do a surface change but they keep the</text>
  <text start="1569.58" dur="3.93">bankers pretty much where they are and</text>
  <text start="1571.77" dur="4.92">this is how you know that it&amp;#39;s all part</text>
  <text start="1573.51" dur="5.28">of the same system but the EU is ready</text>
  <text start="1576.69" dur="4.5">to sign free trade zone agreement with</text>

  <text start="1585.3" dur="3.45">with foreign political and financial</text>
  <text start="1586.92" dur="4.59">assistance so they&amp;#39;re going to join NATO</text>
  <text start="1588.75" dur="4.89">and they&amp;#39;re going to join the EU system</text>
  <text start="1591.51" dur="4.56">and of course they want a visa-free</text>
  <text start="1593.64" dur="5.16">travel regime for Ukraine Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="1596.07" dur="5.82">citizens and that may be put into place</text>
  <text start="1598.8" dur="5.01">before the end of this year and this was</text>
  <text start="1601.89" dur="3.03">their plan from the beginning but they</text>
  <text start="1603.81" dur="1.92">thought they were going to have the</text>
  <text start="1604.92" dur="2.04">entire country</text>
  <text start="1605.73" dur="3.99">but they&amp;#39;re going to have the southeast</text>
  <text start="1606.96" dur="4.74">the Crimea and the west part of Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1609.72" dur="5.73">but it seems like at this time they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1611.7" dur="6.84">only ending up with the west side of</text>
  <text start="1615.45" dur="6.12">Ukraine at this time so what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1618.54" dur="5.49">here is poroshenko seems like he is the</text>
  <text start="1621.57" dur="5.13">victor of these elections and it looks</text>
