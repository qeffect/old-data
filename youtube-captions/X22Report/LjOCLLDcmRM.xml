  <text start="87.19" dur="5.289">deteriorates the banks the central banks</text>
  <text start="90.59" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re going to have to do whatever</text>
  <text start="92.479" dur="5.25">they possibly can to get the money the</text>
  <text start="94.79" dur="4.5">currency from the people and a couple</text>
  <text start="97.729" dur="4.051">days ago we reported that high facin</text>
  <text start="99.29" dur="5.34">bank in germany was going to be charging</text>
  <text start="101.78" dur="4.049">their depositors point four percent to</text>

  <text start="105.829" dur="5.58">that had a hundred thousand euros or</text>
  <text start="107.93" dur="5.88">more well it looks like more banks are</text>
  <text start="111.409" dur="4.831">joining in on this and we know what</text>
  <text start="113.81" dur="5.22">happens here they always start out with</text>
  <text start="116.24" dur="5.19">the very wealthy or they say it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="119.03" dur="6.36">to be those people who have stock or</text>
  <text start="121.43" dur="6.119">anything else in the bank or they we</text>
  <text start="125.39" dur="4.979">start from the upper level and then they</text>
  <text start="127.549" dur="5.131">trickle it down very slowly and we can</text>
  <text start="130.369" dur="3.541">see that this is already happening we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="132.68" dur="3.3">in the beginning they said this wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="133.91" dur="5.46">wasn&amp;#39;t even going to hit depositors and</text>
  <text start="135.98" dur="5.46">now we see that yes it is so we see two</text>
  <text start="139.37" dur="3.78">large banks one of them is going to be</text>
  <text start="141.44" dur="4.23">the bank of ireland is set to become the</text>
  <text start="143.15" dur="4.98">first domestic financial institution to</text>
  <text start="145.67" dur="4.289">pass negative rates to customers for</text>
  <text start="148.13" dur="4.59">placing their money on deposit we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="149.959" dur="4.801">also seeing that RBS is going to be to</text>
  <text start="152.72" dur="3.87">doing the same exact thing so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="154.76" dur="4.14">seeing here is we&amp;#39;re seeing this spread</text>
  <text start="156.59" dur="5.22">because eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="158.9" dur="5.4">happen is these banks are going to have</text>
  <text start="161.81" dur="4.08">to go in and actually take</text>
  <text start="164.3" dur="3.93">the money from the people and that is</text>
  <text start="165.89" dur="5.49">called a ballon because as we know these</text>
  <text start="168.23" dur="4.98">banks are completely insolvent and when</text>
  <text start="171.38" dur="4.2">the system starts to collapse and</text>
  <text start="173.21" dur="4.08">everything starts to fall apart these</text>
  <text start="175.58" dur="2.76">banks the central bank&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="177.29" dur="3.93">going to do they&amp;#39;re going to implement</text>
  <text start="178.34" dur="5.76">the bail and documentation and they will</text>
  <text start="181.22" dur="7.02">go in and take the people&amp;#39;s money but we</text>
  <text start="184.1" dur="6.51">can see investors are already worried</text>
  <text start="188.24" dur="7.11">about what is happening and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="190.61" dur="8.88">lot of funds flowing out of Europe</text>
  <text start="195.35" dur="7.05">they&amp;#39;re moving into emerging markets you</text>
  <text start="199.49" dur="7.65">know the brick system and we can see</text>
  <text start="202.4" dur="8.58">right now that in the last four weeks we</text>
  <text start="207.14" dur="8.28">have seen the largest outflows from</text>
  <text start="210.98" dur="7.53">Europe into the emerging markets and it</text>
  <text start="215.42" dur="6.41">is huge so investors in Europe they are</text>
  <text start="218.51" dur="6.66">leaving we see banks now are going after</text>
  <text start="221.83" dur="7.21">people&amp;#39;s funds and this is going to</text>
  <text start="225.17" dur="6.6">spread all over the place now we see out</text>
  <text start="229.04" dur="5.31">in the Middle East there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="231.77" dur="7.58">another meeting between Lavrov Kerry and</text>
  <text start="234.35" dur="7.08">the UN Syria envoy on August 26 and 27</text>
  <text start="239.35" dur="4.06">supposedly they&amp;#39;re all going to meet and</text>
  <text start="241.43" dur="5.309">sit down and talk about the situation in</text>
  <text start="243.41" dur="9.15">Syria right now Iran is saying that the</text>
  <text start="246.739" dur="9.061">u.s. their strategic agenda in the</text>
  <text start="252.56" dur="7.049">Middle East well it&amp;#39;s not working out</text>
  <text start="255.8" dur="5.75">and we know it&amp;#39;s not working out because</text>
  <text start="259.609" dur="6.451">we can see what is happening there</text>
  <text start="261.55" dur="8.71">turkey for instance they are siding with</text>
  <text start="266.06" dur="7.41">Iran they&amp;#39;re siding with Russia the u.s.</text>
  <text start="270.26" dur="7.44">is taking their nukes out of Turkey now</text>
  <text start="273.47" dur="7.26">we can see that the u.s. is removing</text>
  <text start="277.7" dur="7.26">those nukes but don&amp;#39;t worry the US has</text>
  <text start="280.73" dur="6.21">nuclear subs in this vicinity and they</text>
  <text start="284.96" dur="5.15">have the ability to fire the nukes from</text>
  <text start="286.94" dur="5.49">the subs instead of having the nukes in</text>
  <text start="290.11" dur="3.64">Turkey but they&amp;#39;re taking them and</text>
  <text start="292.43" dur="4.859">they&amp;#39;re removing them and putting them</text>
  <text start="293.75" dur="3.96">into Romania we see right now the US and</text>
  <text start="297.289" dur="5.551">the court</text>
  <text start="297.71" dur="8.76">media they are pushing this Aleppo</text>
  <text start="302.84" dur="7.5">poster child and they&amp;#39;re trying to use</text>
  <text start="306.47" dur="5.85">this to show the world that Assad is a</text>
  <text start="310.34" dur="6.45">terrible person look what is happening</text>
  <text start="312.32" dur="7.31">with Syria bombing the area but we have</text>
  <text start="316.79" dur="6.53">to remember the US the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="319.63" dur="7.78">the terrorists what they have done to</text>
  <text start="323.32" dur="9.57">the children to the civilians not just</text>
  <text start="327.41" dur="10.02">in Syria but in Libya in Afghanistan in</text>
  <text start="332.89" dur="7.12">Lebanon in Yemen the number of innocent</text>
  <text start="337.43" dur="6.12">people that are killed and families</text>
  <text start="340.01" dur="5.19">destroyed is staggering but of course</text>
  <text start="343.55" dur="3.87">what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re picking</text>
  <text start="345.2" dur="4.62">one child who doesn&amp;#39;t even look like</text>
  <text start="347.42" dur="4.83">he&amp;#39;s hurt maybe he got a little hurt but</text>
  <text start="349.82" dur="6.24">he&amp;#39;ll survive but they&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="352.25" dur="6.27">it as the poster child to try to</text>
  <text start="356.06" dur="4.83">demonize Assad once again now they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="358.52" dur="7.53">done this all throughout this time</text>
  <text start="360.89" dur="8.88">period and each time it doesn&amp;#39;t gain any</text>
  <text start="366.05" dur="6.26">traction now the US is getting very very</text>
  <text start="369.77" dur="5.48">worried because we can see that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="372.31" dur="6.73">they are scrambling their fighter jets</text>
  <text start="375.25" dur="6.7">to protect their special operation</text>
  <text start="379.04" dur="4.86">forces in the northeastern area because</text>
  <text start="381.95" dur="3.66">we can see Syria they have been bombing</text>
  <text start="383.9" dur="3.36">in this area and of course the United</text>
  <text start="385.61" dur="4.2">States came out and said you&amp;#39;re bombing</text>
  <text start="387.26" dur="7.55">the Kurds your body bombing the moderate</text>
  <text start="389.81" dur="10.2">rebels and you have to remember the u.s.</text>
  <text start="394.81" dur="6.79">refuses to show Russia to show Syria who</text>
  <text start="400.01" dur="3.48">are the terrorists and who are the</text>
  <text start="401.6" dur="3.03">moderate rebels the reason why they</text>
  <text start="403.49" dur="4.02">don&amp;#39;t want to show them is because they</text>
  <text start="404.63" dur="6.54">want to keep them intertwined this way</text>
  <text start="407.51" dur="6.63">they can use this later on as a way of</text>
  <text start="411.17" dur="6.29">saying look you&amp;#39;re hitting the Kurds</text>
  <text start="414.14" dur="6.96">you&amp;#39;re hitting the moderate rebels and</text>
  <text start="417.46" dur="5.56">you&amp;#39;re hitting our forces and it looks</text>
  <text start="421.1" dur="3.57">like this is where we are headed now</text>
  <text start="423.02" dur="4.1">Russia has already come out and saying</text>
  <text start="424.67" dur="5.07">we weren&amp;#39;t part of this bombing run</text>
  <text start="427.12" dur="4.6">Syria is out there saying listen we were</text>
  <text start="429.74" dur="3.72">hitting terrorists</text>
  <text start="431.72" dur="3.72">and if you&amp;#39;re moderate rebels are</text>
  <text start="433.46" dur="3.51">intertwined well there&amp;#39;s nothing we can</text>
  <text start="435.44" dur="4.59">do about it because you have never</text>
  <text start="436.97" dur="5.82">produced a list of who&amp;#39;s moderate who</text>
  <text start="440.03" dur="5.76">and who is terrace but we could see the</text>
  <text start="442.79" dur="7.22">u.s. is using this so now the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="445.79" dur="7.11">scrambling jets and the u.s. is saying</text>
  <text start="450.01" dur="6.67">we&amp;#39;re going to do whatever we need to do</text>
  <text start="452.9" dur="6.84">to protect the coalition forces which</text>
  <text start="456.68" dur="4.56">tells you right there and then that we</text>
  <text start="459.74" dur="3.66">need to start worrying because we can</text>
  <text start="461.24" dur="4.23">see what they&amp;#39;re building up to because</text>
  <text start="463.4" dur="5.85">they have the propaganda with this boy</text>
  <text start="465.47" dur="5.7">now we have jets scrambling and things</text>
  <text start="469.25" dur="5.22">are starting to heat up at this point</text>
  <text start="471.17" dur="5.73">and why are they heating up because we</text>
  <text start="474.47" dur="4.05">can see at this time the u.s. their</text>
  <text start="476.9" dur="5.46">backs are against the wall they have no</text>
  <text start="478.52" dur="6.2">alternative now out in Ukraine we</text>
  <text start="482.36" dur="5.43">understand that they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="484.72" dur="5.11">war in this area they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="487.79" dur="3.69">saying that Russia is building up forces</text>
  <text start="489.83" dur="3.27">and what Russia is doing right now which</text>
  <text start="491.48" dur="4.14">was planned for quite a while they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="493.1" dur="5.34">having a drill in Crimea Crimea is part</text>
  <text start="495.62" dur="5.13">of Russia and the troops are inside of</text>
  <text start="498.44" dur="4.11">Crimea having a drill so every time if</text>
  <text start="500.75" dur="5.1">you really think about it every time</text>
  <text start="502.55" dur="5.49">NATO has a drill on the border of Russia</text>
  <text start="505.85" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re getting ready to attack we</text>
  <text start="508.04" dur="3.95">should assume that because that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="509.33" dur="5.399">they&amp;#39;re trying to make us believe in</text>
  <text start="511.99" dur="4.989">Ukraine that Russia is going to attack</text>
  <text start="514.729" dur="5.641">but Russia is not going to attack</text>
  <text start="516.979" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;re showing Ukraine listen don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="520.37" dur="5.78">make a move here and when the United</text>
  <text start="523.159" dur="5.551">States does it on the border of Russia</text>
  <text start="526.15" dur="6.73">they&amp;#39;re trying to provoke Russia saying</text>
  <text start="528.71" dur="8.04">we are here make your move but Russia</text>
  <text start="532.88" dur="8.37">never does we see China they are having</text>
  <text start="536.75" dur="8.22">drills in the South China Sea now we see</text>
  <text start="541.25" dur="7.589">all of this happening all at once and we</text>
  <text start="544.97" dur="7.5">can see at this time that everything is</text>
  <text start="548.839" dur="6.781">rapidly falling apart it&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="552.47" dur="6.119">falling apart and as we track this day</text>
  <text start="555.62" dur="6.78">by day by day we see that everything</text>
  <text start="558.589" dur="6.641">it&amp;#39;s not improving it&amp;#39;s actually getting</text>
  <text start="562.4" dur="4.27">worse and time is</text>
  <text start="565.23" dur="3.42">running out for the US government the</text>
  <text start="566.67" dur="4.29">central bankers and they realized this</text>
  <text start="568.65" dur="4.83">and this is why they&amp;#39;re trying to ramp</text>
  <text start="570.96" dur="5.13">things up at this point because as we</text>
  <text start="573.48" dur="7.83">approach the fall we understand that the</text>
  <text start="576.09" dur="10.88">economy is collapsing the elections are</text>
  <text start="581.31" dur="10.2">upon us the US their strategic</text>
  <text start="586.97" dur="8.11">positioning in the Middle East is no</text>
  <text start="591.51" dur="7.2">more the Islamic state their proxy army</text>
  <text start="595.08" dur="8.88">is being defeated in Iraq being defeated</text>
  <text start="598.71" dur="8.67">in Syria China has now joined Syria and</text>
  <text start="603.96" dur="6.51">backing Assad and this is a major</text>
  <text start="607.38" dur="6.36">problem for the United States the United</text>
  <text start="610.47" dur="6.39">States failed with the coup in Turkey</text>
  <text start="613.74" dur="6.6">failed with the terrorist attack in</text>
  <text start="616.86" dur="7.23">Crimea failed with the offensive in</text>
  <text start="620.34" dur="6.99">Aleppo Russia is calling the United</text>
  <text start="624.09" dur="5.73">States out on resupplying the terrorists</text>
  <text start="627.33" dur="5.88">calling them out in supporting the</text>
  <text start="629.82" dur="6.21">terrorists and the United States is not</text>
  <text start="633.21" dur="5.94">looking that great right now and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="636.03" dur="7.05">talking about the government Obama was</text>
  <text start="639.15" dur="8.43">caught in a lie another one and we can</text>
  <text start="643.08" dur="6.63">see that all these banks now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="647.58" dur="5.16">going into negative interest rates and</text>
  <text start="649.71" dur="4.58">taking the people&amp;#39;s money we can see</text>
  <text start="652.74" dur="4.56">that retail sales are declining</text>
  <text start="654.29" dur="5.23">manufacturing is declining GDP declining</text>
  <text start="657.3" dur="5.97">housing bubble popping this is all</text>
  <text start="659.52" dur="5.88">happening at once and this is what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="663.27" dur="4.5">been looking at yes it&amp;#39;s great to look</text>
  <text start="665.4" dur="3.87">back and see the overall picture saying</text>
  <text start="667.77" dur="3.18">yes I understand now this is why</text>
  <text start="669.27" dur="4.11">everything collapsed and we can see the</text>
  <text start="670.95" dur="4.47">picture very clearly but while it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="673.38" dur="5.16">happening right in front of your face</text>
  <text start="675.42" dur="5.67">this is what people can&amp;#39;t see and this</text>
  <text start="678.54" dur="5.79">is why we&amp;#39;re doing this every single day</text>
  <text start="681.09" dur="6.32">so people can see exactly what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="684.33" dur="5.73">happening so none of this is a surprise</text>
  <text start="687.41" dur="5.5">where the government comes out and says</text>
  <text start="690.06" dur="5.64">oh look it just happened because of this</text>
  <text start="692.91" dur="6.03">or this country did it to us no this was</text>
  <text start="695.7" dur="7.62">happening all along we are collapse</text>
  <text start="698.94" dur="7.83">in many areas it&amp;#39;s already collapsed</text>
  <text start="703.32" dur="7.32">Europe is a complete mess and when they</text>
  <text start="706.77" dur="5.85">eventually announce it they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="710.64" dur="4.23">take the blame and move it to another</text>
  <text start="712.62" dur="3.75">area and they&amp;#39;re going to use this to</text>
  <text start="714.87" dur="4.11">convince the people this is why it</text>
  <text start="716.37" dur="4.86">happened but we know this is not why it</text>
