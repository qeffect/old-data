  <text start="53.55" dur="5.22">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="57.12" dur="6.18">rapport my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.77" dur="7.38">episode 1325 a and today&amp;#39;s date is July</text>
  <text start="63.3" dur="5.55">6 2017 and the top of the episode is</text>
  <text start="66.15" dur="6">countries are now moving to nationalize</text>
  <text start="68.85" dur="5.43">their private western central bank let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="72.15" dur="4.859">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="74.28" dur="4.71">news now with each passing day we are</text>
  <text start="77.009" dur="4.591">looking at more and more indicators and</text>
  <text start="78.99" dur="5.58">we can see there are some indicators</text>
  <text start="81.6" dur="5.879">that are just completely flashing red</text>
  <text start="84.57" dur="5.28">signals saying warning warning we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="87.479" dur="5.941">a recession or we&amp;#39;re entering recession</text>
  <text start="89.85" dur="8.09">and it&amp;#39;s following the same pattern that</text>
  <text start="93.42" dur="8.27">we saw back in 2007 moving into 2008 and</text>
  <text start="97.94" dur="6.819">we are getting many more indicators and</text>
  <text start="101.69" dur="7.09">let me tell you it&amp;#39;s really starting to</text>
  <text start="104.759" dur="5.341">look very similar to what happened back</text>
  <text start="108.78" dur="3.3">in 2000</text>
  <text start="110.1" dur="5.25">now ADP they came out with their</text>
  <text start="112.08" dur="5.399">employment numbers and it looks like</text>
  <text start="115.35" dur="5.549">they went ahead and they had to revise</text>
  <text start="117.479" dur="5.31">the main numbers and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="120.899" dur="3.541">main numbers they reported that there</text>
  <text start="122.789" dur="3.661">were about two hundred and fifty-three</text>
  <text start="124.44" dur="3.87">thousand jobs that were added and they</text>
  <text start="126.45" dur="4.44">had to bring it down to two hundred and</text>
  <text start="128.31" dur="5.1">thirty thousand which probably most</text>
  <text start="130.89" dur="5.49">likely they will once again go ahead and</text>
  <text start="133.41" dur="5.34">revise those numbers once again now it</text>
  <text start="136.38" dur="4.17">looks like the June numbers it looks</text>
  <text start="138.75" dur="3.39">like the jobs have only come in around</text>
  <text start="140.55" dur="3.269">one hundred and fifty-eight thousand</text>
  <text start="142.14" dur="4.38">they expected one hundred and eighty</text>
  <text start="143.819" dur="5.491">eight thousand and we can see there was</text>
  <text start="146.52" dur="5.49">no manufacturing jobs that were added</text>
  <text start="149.31" dur="5.16">there were no gains during this month</text>
  <text start="152.01" dur="5.07">whatsoever and we need to understand</text>
  <text start="154.47" dur="5.43">that a lot of these job numbers even</text>
  <text start="157.08" dur="5.58">with ADP we know definitely with the BLS</text>
  <text start="159.9" dur="5.1">they are completely manipulated to</text>
  <text start="162.66" dur="4.59">basically paint this narrative that</text>
  <text start="165" dur="6.3">everything is fine in the job market and</text>
  <text start="167.25" dur="4.62">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing jobs being let go left</text>
  <text start="171.3" dur="2.13">and right</text>
  <text start="171.87" dur="3.78">I mean retail is one of the biggest</text>
  <text start="173.43" dur="5.04">industries right now where jobs are just</text>
  <text start="175.65" dur="5.79">being shed like crazy and we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="178.47" dur="6.05">at the automotive industry and it looks</text>
  <text start="181.44" dur="5.79">like they are in a lot of trouble now</text>
  <text start="184.52" dur="5.41">O&amp;#39;Reilly Automotive</text>
  <text start="187.23" dur="5.7">their stock has crashed as much as 21%</text>
  <text start="189.93" dur="6.449">and when we look at this we can see that</text>
  <text start="192.93" dur="5.339">the oral part retailer says that their</text>
  <text start="196.379" dur="4.771">same store sales well they have</text>
  <text start="198.269" dur="5.25">completely missed the forecast for the</text>
  <text start="201.15" dur="5.97">second quarter when we look at advanced</text>
  <text start="203.519" dur="7.11">autoparts they plunge 16% AutoZone they</text>
  <text start="207.12" dur="5.97">tumble 10% standard Motor Products they</text>
  <text start="210.629" dur="5.97">are down and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="213.09" dur="6.6">the auto part industry well it is</text>
  <text start="216.599" dur="5.64">crashing right now now we take this a</text>
  <text start="219.69" dur="4.799">step further and we look at the entire</text>
  <text start="222.239" dur="4.53">automotive industry we can see that the</text>
  <text start="224.489" dur="5.87">automotive industry has built has been</text>
  <text start="226.769" dur="6.271">built on a gigantic illusion of debt and</text>
  <text start="230.359" dur="5.41">what has happened here is for people to</text>
  <text start="233.04" dur="4.169">basically buy these cars and actually</text>
  <text start="235.769" dur="3.661">they&amp;#39;re not really buying them they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="237.209" dur="3.991">taking out a loan on these cars and many</text>
  <text start="239.43" dur="4.29">of these cars are leased they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="241.2" dur="6.21">even owning or renting them well this is</text>
  <text start="243.72" dur="5.489">how the auto industry got by now when we</text>
  <text start="247.41" dur="5.52">look at this we can see that things are</text>
  <text start="249.209" dur="5.671">slowing down dramatically in fact the</text>
  <text start="252.93" dur="4.919">overall industrial production is</text>
  <text start="254.88" dur="5.699">actually no higher today than it was in</text>
  <text start="257.849" dur="5.13">the fall of 2007 that means there has</text>
  <text start="260.579" dur="5.601">been zero growth in the aggregate</text>
  <text start="262.979" dur="5.851">industrial economy for a full decade</text>
  <text start="266.18" dur="6.34">real production in most sectors of the</text>
  <text start="268.83" dur="6.24">US economy has actually shrunk but has</text>
  <text start="272.52" dur="4.68">been partially offset by a 15 percent</text>
  <text start="275.07" dur="5.069">gain in auto production from the prior</text>
  <text start="277.2" dur="5.88">peak now auto production well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="280.139" dur="6.331">starting to decline now so if this</text>
  <text start="283.08" dur="6.87">so-called recovery loses the automotive</text>
  <text start="286.47" dur="6.48">production that basically boosted up the</text>
  <text start="289.95" dur="5.49">entire economy where will the growth</text>
  <text start="292.95" dur="5.07">come from this is the big question</text>
  <text start="295.44" dur="5.25">because it will completely collapse at</text>
  <text start="298.02" dur="5.579">this point so let&amp;#39;s think about this all</text>
  <text start="300.69" dur="6.09">this for a second how did US households</text>
  <text start="303.599" dur="5.94">afford to buy their new cars when their</text>
  <text start="306.78" dur="4.62">incomes have lagged the purchase price</text>
  <text start="309.539" dur="3.991">of a new car by nearly one-third over</text>
  <text start="311.4" dur="6.21">the last two decades</text>
  <text start="313.53" dur="5.999">well they didn&amp;#39;t now to finance an</text>
  <text start="317.61" dur="3.779">average new vehicle</text>
  <text start="319.529" dur="2.94">it amounts to around thirty thousand</text>
  <text start="321.389" dur="3">nine hundred forty five dollars or</text>
  <text start="322.469" dur="6.68">ninety seven point six percent of the</text>
  <text start="324.389" dur="8.61">average purchase price that&amp;#39;s up 29%</text>
  <text start="329.149" dur="6.16">from the Great Recession and shows quite</text>
  <text start="332.999" dur="6.81">dramatically how the feds bubble finance</text>
  <text start="335.309" dur="6.66">actually works now since about eighty</text>
  <text start="339.809" dur="5.31">five percent or so of new cars are</text>
  <text start="341.969" dur="6.03">financed it means that households they</text>
  <text start="345.119" dur="5.34">are taking out cash to finance the</text>
  <text start="347.999" dur="5.88">transaction fees maybe pay off</text>
  <text start="350.459" dur="5.07">underwater loans or trade-ins and we</text>
  <text start="353.879" dur="4.5">could see that they really don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="355.529" dur="6.21">the cash to actually purchase these</text>
  <text start="358.379" dur="6.81">autos and we know they continually lower</text>
  <text start="361.739" dur="6.36">the requirements for individuals to take</text>
  <text start="365.189" dur="5.76">out loans to subprime the sub subprime</text>
  <text start="368.099" dur="5.76">anyone with a breath they&amp;#39;ll just allow</text>
  <text start="370.949" dur="6.54">anyone to take out a loan now the feds</text>
  <text start="373.859" dur="7.38">survey shows that household sector is</text>
  <text start="377.489" dur="6.48">tapped out on auto credit and that the</text>
  <text start="381.239" dur="6.75">auto loan demand has turned negative for</text>
  <text start="383.969" dur="7.32">the first time since 2008 2009 current</text>
  <text start="387.989" dur="5.52">paychecks are barely keeping up with</text>
  <text start="391.289" dur="5.4">inflation and this means the auto</text>
  <text start="393.509" dur="5.73">industry well they are in trouble and</text>
  <text start="396.689" dur="3.96">this is why we see car sales declining</text>
  <text start="399.239" dur="4.35">and remember how car sales are</text>
  <text start="400.649" dur="5.7">calculated when these cars are channels</text>
  <text start="403.589" dur="5.61">stuffed into the Lots that is considered</text>
  <text start="406.349" dur="6.93">a sale not when they actually sell them</text>
  <text start="409.199" dur="7.5">to a person now when we start to take a</text>
  <text start="413.279" dur="7.41">look at the entire economy we can see</text>
  <text start="416.699" dur="6.57">that things are changing not for the</text>
  <text start="420.689" dur="4.77">good I hate to say but things are</text>
  <text start="423.269" dur="4.8">rapidly deteriorating in the economy and</text>
  <text start="425.459" dur="5.67">coming out of Moneyball economics this</text>
  <text start="428.069" dur="6.63">is Andrew zetlen and he&amp;#39;s using this</text>
  <text start="431.129" dur="6.69">vais index to basically look at the</text>
  <text start="434.699" dur="6.26">economy to see where it is headed and it</text>
  <text start="437.819" dur="5.97">shows that the spending growth is</text>
  <text start="440.959" dur="5.02">continually slowing in fact in the</text>
  <text start="443.789" dur="4.29">latest month it points to a contraction</text>
  <text start="445.979" dur="4.62">in the third quarter and the fourth</text>
  <text start="448.079" dur="5.01">quarter now we&amp;#39;re already slowing down</text>
  <text start="450.599" dur="3.211">in retail because we can see it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="453.089" dur="3.091">right in front of our</text>
  <text start="453.81" dur="3.75">actually if we go back in time we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="456.18" dur="5.07">been looking at this and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="457.56" dur="7.14">watching it slow over time and we can</text>
  <text start="461.25" dur="5.07">see that retail spending well it is</text>
  <text start="464.7" dur="4.05">dropped by five point six percent</text>
  <text start="466.32" dur="5.7">year-over-year and this tells us that</text>
  <text start="468.75" dur="5.91">guess what people just don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="472.02" dur="7.77">extra funds now according to this vise</text>
  <text start="474.66" dur="7.83">Index income growth has also slowed so</text>
  <text start="479.79" dur="5.58">has personal consumption expenditures</text>
  <text start="482.49" dur="6.78">and this is after gas price inflation</text>
  <text start="485.37" dur="6.09">has moderated so when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="489.27" dur="5.45">can see that compensation received</text>
  <text start="491.46" dur="6.209">year-on-year it&amp;#39;s continually declining</text>
  <text start="494.72" dur="4.84">this is why we see the problem in retail</text>
  <text start="497.669" dur="3.691">this is why we see the problem o Beals</text>
  <text start="499.56" dur="4.94">is why we see the problem throughout the</text>
  <text start="501.36" dur="6.45">economy when we look at revolving credit</text>
  <text start="504.5" dur="5.65">revolving credit has rolled over when</text>
  <text start="507.81" dur="6.45">did we see this before that&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="510.15" dur="6.269">prior to 2008 where consumer credit</text>
  <text start="514.26" dur="4.62">rolled over and we&amp;#39;re seeing the same</text>
  <text start="516.419" dur="4.92">thing happen right now now the key</text>
  <text start="518.88" dur="5.19">takeaway from all of this is that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="521.339" dur="6.151">seeing downturns across the board in</text>
  <text start="524.07" dur="6.84">most of the Weisse index data and if we</text>
  <text start="527.49" dur="5.7">look at corporate tax revenues we can</text>
  <text start="530.91" dur="5.22">see if they&amp;#39;re turning down if we look</text>
  <text start="533.19" dur="6.24">at retail stores they&amp;#39;re closing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="536.13" dur="5.7">going bankrupt sales are declining when</text>
  <text start="539.43" dur="4.02">we look at automobiles that is declining</text>
  <text start="541.83" dur="5.97">when we&amp;#39;re looking at housing that is</text>
  <text start="543.45" dur="7.5">declining this is a signal that the</text>
  <text start="547.8" dur="5.97">economy is completely breaking down and</text>
  <text start="550.95" dur="5.25">there&amp;#39;s many other indicators I mean I</text>
  <text start="553.77" dur="4.98">can go on with this long list of many</text>
  <text start="556.2" dur="6.84">many indicators showing that we are in</text>
  <text start="558.75" dur="6.48">big trouble here and if we look back in</text>
  <text start="563.04" dur="4.5">time and we go throughout history we can</text>
  <text start="565.23" dur="5.07">see that we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of the same</text>
  <text start="567.54" dur="6.21">exact economic indicators that we saw</text>
  <text start="570.3" dur="5.52">right before the system came down and it</text>
  <text start="573.75" dur="3.96">finally reaches a point where okay the</text>
  <text start="575.82" dur="3.78">system is completely broke people</text>
  <text start="577.71" dur="4.02">basically look at it and say you know</text>
  <text start="579.6" dur="3.84">what I don&amp;#39;t believe in this system</text>
  <text start="581.73" dur="2.67">anymore I don&amp;#39;t believe that this is</text>
  <text start="583.44" dur="3.33">going to get any better</text>
  <text start="584.4" dur="3.27">many more people are out of work many</text>
  <text start="586.77" dur="3.66">more people can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="587.67" dur="5.73">fine work more and more retail sales</text>
  <text start="590.43" dur="4.55">stores are closing the only thing that</text>
  <text start="593.4" dur="4.2">we don&amp;#39;t see today are the bread lines</text>
  <text start="594.98" dur="3.91">because the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="597.6" dur="3.69">government they figured that one out</text>
  <text start="598.89" dur="5.39">because think about it if we took away</text>
  <text start="601.29" dur="6.57">food stamps today and we took away all</text>
  <text start="604.28" dur="6.91">these entitlement programs we would see</text>
  <text start="607.86" dur="6.06">bread lines soup lines we would see</text>
  <text start="611.19" dur="4.35">people looking for places to live we</text>
  <text start="613.92" dur="5.01">would see a lot of people on the streets</text>
  <text start="615.54" dur="5.58">and these lines would be so long think</text>
  <text start="618.93" dur="3.77">about it right now what is it like 46</text>
  <text start="621.12" dur="4.77">million people that are on food stamps</text>
  <text start="622.7" dur="6.01">think about the lines of people looking</text>
  <text start="625.89" dur="4.8">for food it would be unbelievable and</text>
  <text start="628.71" dur="4.14">people would wake up and say wait what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="630.69" dur="3.78">going on here why do we have this</text>
  <text start="632.85" dur="4.17">problem here this doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="634.47" dur="4.59">this is what they saw back in the Great</text>
  <text start="637.02" dur="4.05">Depression people knew there was a</text>
  <text start="639.06" dur="4.35">problem today you really don&amp;#39;t see that</text>
  <text start="641.07" dur="5.01">they were able to hide all of this into</text>
  <text start="643.41" dur="4.68">the last minute and this was done on</text>
  <text start="646.08" dur="3.84">purpose now many people think well this</text>
  <text start="648.09" dur="4.95">was to help the people it was to help</text>
  <text start="649.92" dur="6.54">them get by no it was to hide what was</text>
  <text start="653.04" dur="5.88">really going on it was to hide that the</text>
  <text start="656.46" dur="6.27">central banking system doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="658.92" dur="6.6">work it was to hide all of this so they</text>
  <text start="662.73" dur="6">can steal as much wealth as possible and</text>
  <text start="665.52" dur="6.33">no one realizes that things were going</text>
  <text start="668.73" dur="5.79">south until it was completely too late</text>
  <text start="671.85" dur="4.46">most of the people in 2008 didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="674.52" dur="4.92">realize any there were any problems</text>
  <text start="676.31" dur="4.27">until it was too late and what was the</text>
  <text start="679.44" dur="3.12">percentage of people that lost their</text>
  <text start="680.58" dur="5.16">wealth what thirty eight percent this</text>
  <text start="682.56" dur="5.91">time it&amp;#39;s going to be much higher now</text>
  <text start="685.74" dur="6.47">out in South Africa they are in a</text>
  <text start="688.47" dur="6.84">recession and the South African ruling</text>
  <text start="692.21" dur="5.41">Congress right now is proposing that the</text>
  <text start="695.31" dur="5.94">country&amp;#39;s central bank the Reserve Bank</text>
  <text start="697.62" dur="6.69">be nationalized and wholly owned by this</text>
  <text start="701.25" dur="5.61">state now of course the central bankers</text>
  <text start="704.31" dur="4.5">are out there saying listen you can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="706.86" dur="4.62">this if you do this your economy is</text>
  <text start="708.81" dur="5.7">going to get a lot worse well this is</text>
  <text start="711.48" dur="5.25">what central bankers always say if you</text>
  <text start="714.51" dur="4.59">decide to do anything against what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="716.73" dur="4.86">saying everything is going to get a lot</text>
  <text start="719.1" dur="4.65">worse which actually is really the</text>
  <text start="721.59" dur="4.86">that things will get a lot better once</text>
  <text start="723.75" dur="5.82">the people take control of the banking</text>
  <text start="726.45" dur="4.71">system but the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="729.57" dur="5.07">really don&amp;#39;t want this to happen because</text>
  <text start="731.16" dur="5.67">remember their entire company their</text>
  <text start="734.64" dur="4.35">entire corporation which these private</text>
  <text start="736.83" dur="6.84">western central banks are their product</text>
  <text start="738.99" dur="7.47">is debt they deal in debt and if you</text>
  <text start="743.67" dur="5.1">basically nationalize the banks and the</text>
  <text start="746.46" dur="4.68">people take control of the bank guess</text>
  <text start="748.77" dur="6.63">what you&amp;#39;re controlling everything and</text>
  <text start="751.14" dur="7.35">in today&amp;#39;s world once this global</text>
  <text start="755.4" dur="6.39">economy comes down and if enough people</text>
  <text start="758.49" dur="7.77">wake up we are going to see a lot more</text>
  <text start="761.79" dur="8.06">private central banks be nationalized</text>
  <text start="766.26" dur="7.11">basically taken over by the people and</text>
  <text start="769.85" dur="6.49">most likely what we need to do is get</text>
  <text start="773.37" dur="6.21">rid of the private west of central</text>
  <text start="776.34" dur="7.86">bank&amp;#39;s completely and let the people</text>
  <text start="779.58" dur="6.81">create their own currency and they need</text>
  <text start="784.2" dur="5.25">to create the currency without interest</text>
  <text start="786.39" dur="5.25">attached this is the big sticking point</text>
  <text start="789.45" dur="4.8">because once you get rid of that</text>
  <text start="791.64" dur="6.78">interest you get rid of a lot of the</text>
  <text start="794.25" dur="6.51">debt because now government&amp;#39;s they can</text>
  <text start="798.42" dur="4.92">issue a currency there&amp;#39;s no debt</text>
  <text start="800.76" dur="4.05">attached to it and it can go out to the</text>
  <text start="803.34" dur="3.36">people and the currency can actually</text>
  <text start="804.81" dur="4.59">have value now if you take that and you</text>
  <text start="806.7" dur="5.34">attach it to maybe silver or gold where</text>
  <text start="809.4" dur="5.94">there&amp;#39;s checks and balances well then</text>
  <text start="812.04" dur="5.34">you have something even better and this</text>
  <text start="815.34" dur="4.74">is why China and Russia</text>
  <text start="817.38" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;ve been accumulating a lot of gold</text>
  <text start="820.08" dur="3.81">and they&amp;#39;re continually accumulating a</text>
  <text start="821.64" dur="4.47">lot of gold because they realize when</text>
  <text start="823.89" dur="3.72">the time comes they&amp;#39;re going to need</text>
  <text start="826.11" dur="3.45">that but they&amp;#39;re going to use that goal</text>
  <text start="827.61" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re going to need that gold because</text>
  <text start="829.56" dur="4.11">the dollar it will be worth absolutely</text>
  <text start="831.75" dur="4.17">nothing the dollar will no longer exist</text>
  <text start="833.67" dur="4.23">it will not be read the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="835.92" dur="3">of the world and they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="837.9" dur="3.81">to resort to something completely</text>
  <text start="838.92" dur="4.11">different and throughout history we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="841.71" dur="3.72">seen this happen where there were</text>
  <text start="843.03" dur="4.77">reserve currencies of the world and they</text>
  <text start="845.43" dur="3.96">cease to exist and they are no longer</text>
  <text start="847.8" dur="4.59">the reserve currencies of the world</text>
  <text start="849.39" dur="5.43">we&amp;#39;re going to see the same thing happen</text>
  <text start="852.39" dur="3.24">once again we&amp;#39;ve reached that time</text>
  <text start="854.82" dur="4.56">period</text>
  <text start="855.63" dur="7.65">where the global economy has reached a</text>
  <text start="859.38" dur="6.09">point where the central bankers they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="863.28" dur="5.37">done as much manipulation as they</text>
  <text start="865.47" dur="6.06">possibly can they can&amp;#39;t do anything else</text>
  <text start="868.65" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re going to try but what happens</text>
  <text start="871.53" dur="3.54">here it doesn&amp;#39;t matter about the stock</text>
  <text start="873.18" dur="6.15">market doesn&amp;#39;t matter about anything</text>
  <text start="875.07" dur="6.36">else when the individual people start to</text>
  <text start="879.33" dur="4.14">realize and we&amp;#39;re starting to see this</text>
  <text start="881.43" dur="4.92">throughout the world this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="883.47" dur="4.65">protesting at the g20 this is why we see</text>
  <text start="886.35" dur="4.86">protests out in Europe about the central</text>
  <text start="888.12" dur="6.18">banking system because what happens is</text>
  <text start="891.21" dur="4.89">as you continually push austerity on the</text>
  <text start="894.3" dur="4.92">people and there are more and more</text>
  <text start="896.1" dur="4.73">individuals out of work when the value</text>
  <text start="899.22" dur="4.53">of the currency continually declines</text>
  <text start="900.83" dur="7.47">when the banking system starts to fall</text>
  <text start="903.75" dur="7.56">apart and the world is smothered in debt</text>
  <text start="908.3" dur="6.07">well the people start to say okay this</text>
  <text start="911.31" dur="6.18">is enough this is not working out for</text>
  <text start="914.37" dur="5.19">any of our economies and people said</text>
  <text start="917.49" dur="4.83">well this is never going to happen</text>
  <text start="919.56" dur="5.27">it already has countries are</text>
  <text start="922.32" dur="5.64">accumulating gold people are</text>
  <text start="924.83" dur="7.72">accumulating gold and silver you see the</text>
  <text start="927.96" dur="6.54">rise of the crypto market where the</text>
  <text start="932.55" dur="5.82">emerging markets these countries are</text>
  <text start="934.5" dur="7.92">looking for a way to use the crypto</text>
  <text start="938.37" dur="6.99">market to transfer funds they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="942.42" dur="5.16">it to make purchases you see it here in</text>
  <text start="945.36" dur="5.1">the United Sates yes it&amp;#39;s very young but</text>
  <text start="947.58" dur="5.22">the reason why it was born was because</text>
  <text start="950.46" dur="4.71">people wanted something different they</text>
  <text start="952.8" dur="6.95">wanted a system where it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="955.17" dur="7.71">controlled by a central organization</text>
  <text start="959.75" dur="5.95">where they can manipulate everything and</text>
  <text start="962.88" dur="5.16">this is just the beginning stages and</text>
  <text start="965.7" dur="3.72">once this starts to grow and it gets</text>
  <text start="968.04" dur="3.45">bigger and bigger and more and more</text>
  <text start="969.42" dur="4.17">people look up look at this and they say</text>
  <text start="971.49" dur="4.41">you know something why do we need the</text>
  <text start="973.59" dur="4.86">central bank what are they doing for us</text>
  <text start="975.9" dur="4.89">does it really help the economy because</text>
  <text start="978.45" dur="4.26">the central bank is really doing the</text>
  <text start="980.79" dur="4.68">same thing as let&amp;#39;s say the crypto</text>
  <text start="982.71" dur="5.16">market they&amp;#39;re creating currency out of</text>
  <text start="985.47" dur="3.93">thin air the crypto market creates</text>
  <text start="987.87" dur="4.59">currency what</text>
  <text start="989.4" dur="5.79">out of thin air the central bank creates</text>
  <text start="992.46" dur="5.88">the currency with interest attached the</text>
  <text start="995.19" dur="6.17">crypto market creates currency with no</text>
  <text start="998.34" dur="7.8">interest attached the central bank</text>
  <text start="1001.36" dur="8.98">controls that currency the interest the</text>
  <text start="1006.14" dur="7.26">profits flow back into this corporation</text>
  <text start="1010.34" dur="7.95">the crypto currency it&amp;#39;s decentralized</text>
  <text start="1013.4" dur="8.31">it flows back to nobody because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1018.29" dur="6.84">no interest attached so we can see the</text>
  <text start="1021.71" dur="5.04">movement has already started and a lot</text>
  <text start="1025.13" dur="3.72">of countries are going to say you know</text>
  <text start="1026.75" dur="3.57">something maybe we should be looking at</text>
  <text start="1028.85" dur="4.26">this do we really need the central bank</text>
  <text start="1030.32" dur="5.1">should we nationalize it maybe get rid</text>
  <text start="1033.11" dur="4.979">of it because what&amp;#39;s the purpose of it</text>
  <text start="1035.42" dur="4.5">and I think this is the beginning stages</text>
  <text start="1038.089" dur="3.991">of all this and people are going to</text>
  <text start="1039.92" dur="5.039">start to realize that yet we really</text>
  <text start="1042.08" dur="5.4">don&amp;#39;t need this whatsoever we have other</text>
  <text start="1044.959" dur="5.491">alternatives so we can see that things</text>
  <text start="1047.48" dur="5.76">are actually changing and as this system</text>
  <text start="1050.45" dur="6">comes down people in many countries</text>
  <text start="1053.24" dur="5.46">people around the world government</text>
