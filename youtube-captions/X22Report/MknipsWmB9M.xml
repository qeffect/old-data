  <text start="133.75" dur="6.29">the State Department they don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="136.81" dur="6.149">know and they can&amp;#39;t accurately track</text>

  <text start="181.42" dur="4.77">however the OIG claims that the state</text>
  <text start="183.64" dur="3.42">has still not developed the ability to</text>
  <text start="186.19" dur="3.18">properly</text>
  <text start="187.06" dur="5.039">manage the funds and they can&amp;#39;t figure</text>
  <text start="189.37" dur="5.97">out where this goes now the report comes</text>
  <text start="192.099" dur="5.64">after a budget proposal from Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="195.34" dur="7.52">administration would suggest cutting</text>
  <text start="197.739" dur="9.091">this funding by 28% and putting in a</text>
  <text start="202.86" dur="6.849">system to track where this money flows</text>
  <text start="206.83" dur="5.189">and where it goes and we know that most</text>
  <text start="209.709" dur="4.291">likely a lot of these funds are not</text>
  <text start="212.019" dur="4.171">going to where they say they are going</text>
  <text start="214" dur="5.94">and we know that a lot of these</text>
  <text start="216.19" dur="4.71">organizations the NGOs and organizations</text>
  <text start="219.94" dur="4.32">like us Aid</text>
  <text start="220.9" dur="6.63">these are fronts they take the money in</text>
  <text start="224.26" dur="5.729">they disperse it nobody keeps track who</text>
  <text start="227.53" dur="4.38">knows where they go and we know that</text>
  <text start="229.989" dur="4.681">they probably go in to certain</text>
  <text start="231.91" dur="5.13">organizations that are creating maybe</text>
  <text start="234.67" dur="4.5">regime change in other countries maybe</text>
  <text start="237.04" dur="4.71">going to terrorist groups or other</text>
  <text start="239.17" dur="4.74">places now it looks like the Democrats</text>
  <text start="241.75" dur="4.53">they are pushing their agenda right now</text>
  <text start="243.91" dur="4.74">and it looks like there are about 25</text>
  <text start="246.28" dur="5.91">House Democrats that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="248.65" dur="4.77">back this bill to impeach Trump and what</text>
  <text start="252.19" dur="2.7">they&amp;#39;re trying to do now since the</text>
  <text start="253.42" dur="3.39">Russian collusion thing is completely</text>
  <text start="254.89" dur="3.629">failed the Russian hacking thing has</text>
  <text start="256.81" dur="3.87">completely failed it&amp;#39;s all turning out</text>
  <text start="258.519" dur="3.9">to be fake phony and false and we know</text>
  <text start="260.68" dur="4.71">that they completely made all of this up</text>
  <text start="262.419" dur="6.451">it looks like Nancy Pelosi debbie</text>
  <text start="265.39" dur="5.31">Wasserman Schultz and others are getting</text>
  <text start="268.87" dur="4.049">together creating and they&amp;#39;re working on</text>
  <text start="270.7" dur="3.93">this bill to impeach Trump now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="272.919" dur="3.631">going to try to use article four to the</text>
  <text start="274.63" dur="3.72">25th amendment in the abstract the</text>
  <text start="276.55" dur="3.54">amendment itself is about presidential</text>
  <text start="278.35" dur="3.51">succession and includes language about</text>
  <text start="280.09" dur="3.99">the power of the office when a president</text>
  <text start="281.86" dur="4.8">is incapacitated</text>
  <text start="284.08" dur="4.98">now remember Congress would have to vote</text>
  <text start="286.66" dur="4.59">on this or they can get the vice</text>
  <text start="289.06" dur="4.53">president and majority of the executive</text>
  <text start="291.25" dur="6.15">branches cabinet to get together and</text>
  <text start="293.59" dur="5.97">they could do this under the 25th</text>
  <text start="297.4" dur="4.53">amendment now is this really going to</text>
  <text start="299.56" dur="4.47">work most likely not I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="301.93" dur="4.77">just trying anything they possibly can</text>
  <text start="304.03" dur="5.85">because they have nothing left now we</text>
  <text start="306.7" dur="5.07">know that Trump put together this panel</text>
  <text start="309.88" dur="4.83">this voter fraud panel to investigate</text>
  <text start="311.77" dur="5.67">voto voter fraud in all the different</text>
  <text start="314.71" dur="4.5">states and it looks like there are 29</text>
  <text start="317.44" dur="3.27">states that are refusing to comply with</text>
  <text start="319.21" dur="4.08">his election fraud commissions</text>
  <text start="320.71" dur="5.46">us for voter data to a commission he</text>
  <text start="323.29" dur="5.67">created to investigate the alleged voter</text>
  <text start="326.17" dur="4.44">fraud and they&amp;#39;re saying that yeah we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="328.96" dur="3.9">not handing this information over and</text>
  <text start="330.61" dur="4.22">Trump is out there saying well why not</text>
  <text start="332.86" dur="5.13">why don&amp;#39;t these states want to cooperate</text>
  <text start="334.83" dur="5.95">to crack down on voter fraud what are</text>
  <text start="337.99" dur="4.26">they trying to hide and this commission</text>
  <text start="340.78" dur="2.91">which is the Trump&amp;#39;s presidential</text>
  <text start="342.25" dur="3.96">Advisory Commission on election</text>
  <text start="343.69" dur="5.04">integrity well we know it was formed to</text>
  <text start="346.21" dur="6.15">find out if there are millions of</text>
  <text start="348.73" dur="5.07">illegal people voting are there dead</text>
  <text start="352.36" dur="3.48">people that are put into the category</text>
  <text start="353.8" dur="4.23">are there illegal immigrants voting</text>
  <text start="355.84" dur="5.13">where are all these votes coming from</text>
  <text start="358.03" dur="6.03">can we basically go into the system and</text>
  <text start="360.97" dur="5.34">account for all these votes and we can</text>
  <text start="364.06" dur="4.59">see that this panel sent letters to 50</text>
  <text start="366.31" dur="4.11">states and 29 of them said listen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="368.65" dur="4.77">not going to abide by this whatsoever</text>
  <text start="370.42" dur="6.75">and they said absolutely not now the</text>
  <text start="373.42" dur="5.13">information that was requested was the</text>
  <text start="377.17" dur="3.09">last four digits of Social Security</text>
  <text start="378.55" dur="4.59">numbers not the full social security</text>
  <text start="380.26" dur="5.01">number an address a birthdate political</text>
  <text start="383.14" dur="4.41">affiliation felony convictions and</text>
  <text start="385.27" dur="4.14">voting histories and the request was for</text>
  <text start="387.55" dur="4.59">information publicly available under</text>
  <text start="389.41" dur="5.13">each state&amp;#39;s law and the states are</text>
  <text start="392.14" dur="4.41">saying well no this is private we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="394.54" dur="4.35">want to give this out but this is public</text>
  <text start="396.55" dur="5.16">information that anyone can walk into</text>
  <text start="398.89" dur="4.8">these different voting areas and get</text>
  <text start="401.71" dur="3.93">this information and the question is are</text>
  <text start="403.69" dur="3.96">they hiding something why don&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="405.64" dur="4.29">want to cooperate why don&amp;#39;t they want to</text>
  <text start="407.65" dur="4.05">say listen our voting system is on the</text>
  <text start="409.93" dur="3.72">up-and-up because I don&amp;#39;t think they</text>
  <text start="411.7" dur="4.53">really know who&amp;#39;s voting and who&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="413.65" dur="4.2">voting and if we go back in time to a</text>
  <text start="416.23" dur="3.99">documentary film called hacking</text>
  <text start="417.85" dur="5.76">democracy with Bev Harris she&amp;#39;s walked</text>
  <text start="420.22" dur="6.09">into many of these voting areas and she</text>
  <text start="423.61" dur="4.89">found the voting information in the</text>
  <text start="426.31" dur="4.02">garbage they didn&amp;#39;t want to hand it over</text>
  <text start="428.5" dur="4.38">to her and she found that there were</text>
  <text start="430.33" dur="4.32">many many discrepancies on what really</text>
  <text start="432.88" dur="3.72">happened and the people that were in</text>
  <text start="434.65" dur="3.93">charge they had no clue or they were</text>
  <text start="436.6" dur="4.08">pretending they had no clue what was</text>
  <text start="438.58" dur="4.17">really going on and we can see that</text>
  <text start="440.68" dur="5.04">there are many states Arizona California</text>
  <text start="442.75" dur="5.25">Connecticut Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky</text>
  <text start="445.72" dur="5.16">Massachusetts Minnesota Mississippi</text>
  <text start="448" dur="6.74">Montana and many many others that are</text>
  <text start="450.88" dur="6.86">saying we are not at all going to Kauai</text>
  <text start="454.74" dur="5.25">operate with this whatsoever so we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="457.74" dur="4.56">have to see where this goes and how this</text>
  <text start="459.99" dur="6.209">proceeds now we know that Trump and</text>
  <text start="462.3" dur="6.06">South Korean president moon jae-in they</text>
  <text start="466.199" dur="3.931">met in the White House and we see all</text>
  <text start="468.36" dur="4.44">over the corporate media they were using</text>
  <text start="470.13" dur="5.099">the phrase the error of strategic</text>
  <text start="472.8" dur="5.459">patience with North Korea regime has</text>
  <text start="475.229" dur="5.581">failed many years that it&amp;#39;s failed and</text>
  <text start="478.259" dur="4.651">frankly that patience is over and this</text>
  <text start="480.81" dur="3.09">was coming from Donald Trump and many</text>
  <text start="482.91" dur="2.939">people are out there saying well this</text>
  <text start="483.9" dur="4.56">means war that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s getting at</text>
  <text start="485.849" dur="5.31">well we really need to look at this for</text>
  <text start="488.46" dur="4.56">a second first of all moon jae-in he was</text>
  <text start="491.159" dur="3.721">talking about having diplomatic</text>
  <text start="493.02" dur="5.1">relations with North Korea is North</text>
  <text start="494.88" dur="6.569">Korea this incredible fantastic place</text>
  <text start="498.12" dur="6.09">know there are issues within the country</text>
  <text start="501.449" dur="4.741">otto warmbier who came back he passed</text>
  <text start="504.21" dur="4.32">away he should have never happened</text>
  <text start="506.19" dur="3.18">and we need to look at what he really</text>
  <text start="508.53" dur="3.03">meant by this</text>
  <text start="509.37" dur="4.89">first of all strategic patience that was</text>
  <text start="511.56" dur="4.8">the strategy of the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="514.26" dur="3.899">where they did nothing they didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="516.36" dur="3.809">to speak to North Korea they didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="518.159" dur="5.24">to have words with North Korea they just</text>
  <text start="520.169" dur="7.23">wanted to use the Armed Forces and</text>
  <text start="523.399" dur="6.371">provocation to force North Korea and we</text>
  <text start="527.399" dur="4.831">can see from this statement the error of</text>
  <text start="529.77" dur="6.21">strategic patience with North Korea</text>
  <text start="532.23" dur="7.65">regime has failed Obama&amp;#39;s strategy has</text>
  <text start="535.98" dur="8.28">failed by staying silent and by using</text>
  <text start="539.88" dur="8.22">force to get their way it didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="544.26" dur="6.99">and his patience with his strategy with</text>
  <text start="548.1" dur="4.109">North Korea is over and yes he went on</text>
  <text start="551.25" dur="3">to say that the North Korean</text>
  <text start="552.209" dur="3.421">dictatorship has no regard for safety</text>
  <text start="554.25" dur="3.6">and security for its people or its</text>
  <text start="555.63" dur="4.38">neighbors and has no respect for human</text>
  <text start="557.85" dur="5.34">life as we can see with Otto röhm beer</text>
  <text start="560.01" dur="7.47">and we see right now that moon jae-in</text>
  <text start="563.19" dur="7.41">and Trump well they are looking at the</text>
  <text start="567.48" dur="5.19">situation and they&amp;#39;re saying well we</text>
  <text start="570.6" dur="5.37">need to work with other allies in the</text>
  <text start="572.67" dur="4.77">region including Japan China like</text>
  <text start="575.97" dur="5.15">they&amp;#39;re working with now and other</text>
  <text start="577.44" dur="6.6">global partners on a range of diplomatic</text>
  <text start="581.12" dur="5.11">security and economic measures to</text>
  <text start="584.04" dur="3.95">protect our our lives and our own</text>
  <text start="586.23" dur="6.29">citizens from North Korea</text>
  <text start="587.99" dur="8.61">yeah now Trump and moon jae-in well they</text>
  <text start="592.52" dur="6.39">agree about bringing peace to the area</text>
  <text start="596.6" dur="3.87">the threat and provocation of North</text>
  <text start="598.91" dur="4.41">Korea will be met with stern with a</text>
  <text start="600.47" dur="6.66">stern response that response will employ</text>
  <text start="603.32" dur="6.47">both sanctions and dialogue in a phased</text>
  <text start="607.13" dur="5.16">and comprehensive approach to</text>
  <text start="609.79" dur="5.76">denuclearizing North Korea</text>
  <text start="612.29" dur="6.33">so it looks like from staying silent</text>
  <text start="615.55" dur="6.31">using provocation and the armed forces</text>
  <text start="618.62" dur="5.18">they&amp;#39;re going to move towards sanctions</text>
  <text start="621.86" dur="5.37">which we know is not going to work and</text>
  <text start="623.8" dur="5.83">dialogue that&amp;#39;s the important part of</text>
  <text start="627.23" dur="6">this because we can see that North Korea</text>
  <text start="629.63" dur="7.38">has already said listen we will stop</text>
  <text start="633.23" dur="5.82">with what we are doing if the u.s. stops</text>
  <text start="637.01" dur="4.829">the provocations with all these drills</text>
  <text start="639.05" dur="5.01">in South Korea and we&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="641.839" dur="5.221">to see how this moves forward because I</text>
  <text start="644.06" dur="4.92">don&amp;#39;t think this means war I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="647.06" dur="4.41">it means what the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="648.98" dur="4.349">painting this out debate this means</text>
  <text start="651.47" dur="6.239">we&amp;#39;re not going to use the same strategy</text>
  <text start="653.329" dur="6.361">that Obama used with staying silent not</text>
  <text start="657.709" dur="4.291">talking to North Korea having known</text>
  <text start="659.69" dur="5.19">political discussion with them and just</text>

  <text start="698.81" dur="7.44">down because otherwise we enter into war</text>
  <text start="703.13" dur="6.39">and we can see this is the approach that</text>
  <text start="706.25" dur="6.54">is being taken right now we also see out</text>
  <text start="709.52" dur="5.97">in the Philippines nearly 40 days after</text>
  <text start="712.79" dur="4.47">the battle between the Philippine Army</text>
  <text start="715.49" dur="3.63">and the Islamic state looks like the</text>
  <text start="717.26" dur="4.65">Armed Forces of the Philippines they</text>
  <text start="719.12" dur="4.53">have finally contained the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="721.91" dur="3.93">and it looks like their days are</text>
  <text start="723.65" dur="4.35">completely numbered and that threat is</text>
  <text start="725.84" dur="4.47">looks like it&amp;#39;s almost over with right</text>
  <text start="728" dur="4.8">now we see Turkey right now they have</text>
  <text start="730.31" dur="4.77">completed the deal with Russia they have</text>
  <text start="732.8" dur="4.44">now purchased the s400 missile system</text>
  <text start="735.08" dur="4.41">remember the s400 is a high altitude</text>
  <text start="737.24" dur="3.93">long-range air defense system with an</text>
  <text start="739.49" dur="4.29">active radar guidance and a range of</text>

  <text start="745.79" dur="5.99">distance of up to 150 kilometers away</text>
  <text start="748.25" dur="8.43">and we can see right now with guitar</text>
  <text start="751.78" dur="7.99">that there&amp;#39;s one day until the Saudi</text>
  <text start="756.68" dur="5.49">ultimatum expires and guitars saying</text>
  <text start="759.77" dur="5.34">listen we&amp;#39;re not changing our stance</text>
  <text start="762.17" dur="7.38">right now at all we are not meeting any</text>
  <text start="765.11" dur="7.2">of the demands of Saudi Arabia now</text>
  <text start="769.55" dur="6.51">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that Putin</text>
  <text start="772.31" dur="6.15">well he is stressing the importance of</text>
  <text start="776.06" dur="4.44">political diplomatic efforts aimed at</text>
  <text start="778.46" dur="4.17">overcoming differences of opinion and</text>

  <text start="791.27" dur="5.13">cooperation between their countries and</text>
  <text start="793.19" dur="5.61">energy and investment and we can see</text>
  <text start="796.4" dur="5.27">what is happening right now the entire</text>
  <text start="798.8" dur="5.82">Middle East is being broken apart and</text>
  <text start="801.67" dur="6.46">the reason for this is because things</text>
  <text start="804.62" dur="7.65">are changing now the petro dollar system</text>
  <text start="808.13" dur="6.51">is at its end game these different</text>
  <text start="812.27" dur="4.38">Middle Eastern countries well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="814.64" dur="4.32">going to have to make deals economic</text>
  <text start="816.65" dur="4.73">deals with other countries to survive</text>
  <text start="818.96" dur="4.62">right now and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="821.38" dur="4.87">guitar saying that they are open to</text>
  <text start="823.58" dur="5.91">negotiations but they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="826.25" dur="5.91">bow to the demands of the Gulf nations</text>
  <text start="829.49" dur="5.67">so we&amp;#39;ll have to see by tomorrow what</text>
  <text start="832.16" dur="5.67">happens will the deep state do something</text>
  <text start="835.16" dur="5.43">to set this whole thing and unravel it</text>
  <text start="837.83" dur="6.96">and maybe start a war or does it die</text>
  <text start="840.59" dur="6.21">down and nothing happens and the Gulf</text>
  <text start="844.79" dur="4.38">nations guitar they start to negotiate</text>
  <text start="846.8" dur="5.01">the one thing that it did do it brought</text>
  <text start="849.17" dur="4.35">out that these Gulf nations guitar and</text>
  <text start="851.81" dur="3.68">it&amp;#39;s not just guitar it&amp;#39;s Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="853.52" dur="5">Jordan it&amp;#39;s United and</text>
  <text start="855.49" dur="5.88">it&amp;#39;s they all dealt in terrorism al sham</text>
  <text start="858.52" dur="4.62">al Qaeda Islamic state these nations</text>
  <text start="861.37" dur="4.65">were supporting it these nations were</text>
  <text start="863.14" dur="5.73">funding it and we know that this was all</text>
  <text start="866.02" dur="4.95">intertwined with the deep state United</text>
  <text start="868.87" dur="5.219">States government central bankers Israel</text>
  <text start="870.97" dur="5.46">and many others out in Syria we can see</text>
  <text start="874.089" dur="3.991">that they have the first ever woman to</text>
  <text start="876.43" dur="5.07">assume the rank of Brigadier General and</text>

  <text start="881.5" dur="6.63">Badar she is now a general in the Armed</text>
  <text start="885.279" dur="5.911">Forces and we can see that everything</text>
  <text start="888.13" dur="5.85">the corporate media is trying to tell us</text>
  <text start="891.19" dur="5.73">is actually the opposite that has been</text>
  <text start="893.98" dur="6.27">happening out in Syria and their whole</text>
  <text start="896.92" dur="5.7">agenda throughout this entire time was</text>
  <text start="900.25" dur="4.44">to capture Syria then head into Iran and</text>
  <text start="902.62" dur="4.469">set up this pipeline this natural gas</text>
  <text start="904.69" dur="4.23">pipeline coming from Qatar through Syria</text>
  <text start="907.089" dur="4.381">up into Europe but we can see already</text>
  <text start="908.92" dur="4.65">that Russia has already started the</text>
  <text start="911.47" dur="4.32">pipeline moving into Turkey which is</text>
  <text start="913.57" dur="5.13">going to feed into Europe everything is</text>
  <text start="915.79" dur="5.73">about to change right now but Israel we</text>
  <text start="918.7" dur="4.85">can see they are not stopping they have</text>
  <text start="921.52" dur="5.819">attacked for the fifth time this week</text>
  <text start="923.55" dur="5.83">the southern part of Syria they targeted</text>
  <text start="927.339" dur="4.581">the Syrian military art artillery</text>
  <text start="929.38" dur="5.61">positions because they said they were</text>
  <text start="931.92" dur="5.26">shelled no one was heard of course it</text>
  <text start="934.99" dur="5.58">landed in the desert and they used this</text>
  <text start="937.18" dur="4.649">to go in and attack this area now one of</text>
  <text start="940.57" dur="3.42">the reasons why this was probably</text>
  <text start="941.829" dur="4.891">happening is because the rebels al nusra</text>
  <text start="943.99" dur="5.01">they were being beat in this area and it</text>
  <text start="946.72" dur="5.03">looks like well the Syrian army they</text>
  <text start="949" dur="5.94">recaptured all the territory and the</text>
  <text start="951.75" dur="6.329">Israeli backed offensive did not work at</text>
  <text start="954.94" dur="5.339">all it just didn&amp;#39;t work now we know that</text>
  <text start="958.079" dur="3.941">representative Tulsi Gabbard she went to</text>
  <text start="960.279" dur="4.321">Syria she looked at the situation and</text>

  <text start="976.66" dur="3.84">these two pieces of legislation well</text>
  <text start="978.85" dur="3.57">they were supposed to bar federal</text>

  <text start="992.529" dur="5.821">on this before and it shows who these</text>
  <text start="995.529" dur="5.191">government officials are truly working</text>
  <text start="998.35" dur="5.989">for because think about this for a</text>

  <text start="1014.76" dur="6.21">right now that war is a racket and</text>
  <text start="1018" dur="4.649">remember there&amp;#39;s a lot of lobbyists</text>

  <text start="1063.15" dur="5.67">if you notice no one&amp;#39;s even looking at</text>
  <text start="1066.03" dur="5.67">it now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="1068.82" dur="4.349">we talked about the belt and road system</text>
  <text start="1071.7" dur="3.599">that China is developing and we know</text>

  <text start="1085.44" dur="6.21">to push their TPP they wanted that</text>
  <text start="1088.049" dur="7.191">instead of what China was doing and we</text>
  <text start="1091.65" dur="6.96">can see right now in the area of</text>
  <text start="1095.24" dur="4.75">Pakistan there was sightings of the</text>

  <text start="1102.419" dur="7.741">by militants from the Islamic state now</text>
  <text start="1106.38" dur="5.82">in reality the terror attack was very</text>
  <text start="1110.16" dur="4.92">precise in terms of location and purpose</text>
  <text start="1112.2" dur="5.849">remember the us the intelligence</text>

  <text start="1148.08" dur="6.089">to disrupt what is going on here and</text>
  <text start="1150.84" dur="7.05">this shows us once again how much they</text>
  <text start="1154.169" dur="6.601">don&amp;#39;t want this to proceed because they</text>
  <text start="1157.89" dur="4.71">will lose control and what is happening</text>
  <text start="1160.77" dur="4.11">right now they are becoming desperate to</text>

  <text start="1166.86" dur="7.74">coincidence this was specifically set up</text>
  <text start="1170.159" dur="8.101">to disrupt this entire project now we</text>
  <text start="1174.6" dur="8.22">see that the OPCW report came out about</text>
  <text start="1178.26" dur="7.47">the Syrian gas attack back in April and</text>
  <text start="1182.82" dur="5.339">the organization for the prohibition of</text>

  <text start="1192.14" dur="6.22">Shakuni on April 4th there was sarin gas</text>
  <text start="1195.809" dur="5.85">that was used and this is the military</text>

  <text start="1215.809" dur="8.651">investigation now the Syrian government</text>
  <text start="1219.809" dur="9.6">said they would fly the entire team into</text>

  <text start="1229.409" dur="8.611">a formal investigation on site and they</text>
  <text start="1233.85" dur="8.24">refused instead they took information</text>
  <text start="1238.02" dur="8.31">from other sources and they never</text>
  <text start="1242.09" dur="7.24">visited the location so they used NGO</text>
  <text start="1246.33" dur="6.42">groups they use the white helmets they</text>
  <text start="1249.33" dur="6.09">used social media they used everything</text>
  <text start="1252.75" dur="4.53">but doing a physical investigation now</text>

  <text start="1260.1" dur="8.31">there was no real investigation that was</text>

  <text start="1274.56" dur="4.68">explained to the OPCW what exactly</text>

  <text start="1279.24" dur="6.27">Russia is saying listen we need an</text>

  <text start="1289.71" dur="4.83">without actually going to the site it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1291.99" dur="5.13">completely impossible but we could see</text>
