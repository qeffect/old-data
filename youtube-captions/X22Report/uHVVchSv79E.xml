  <text start="71.13" dur="4.37">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="73.26" dur="5.79">news now as we can see cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="75.5" dur="5.77">the it has really taken off and Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="79.05" dur="5.22">and many other crypto currencies have</text>
  <text start="81.27" dur="4.5">taken off as well and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="84.27" dur="3.99">is that the bankers they&amp;#39;re struggling</text>
  <text start="85.77" dur="4.709">to control the situation even the</text>
  <text start="88.26" dur="3.24">government the SEC they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="90.479" dur="3.511">involved they&amp;#39;re very worried about</text>
  <text start="91.5" dur="3.96">cryptocurrencies Bitcoin IC OS and</text>
  <text start="93.99" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re trying to create these</text>
  <text start="95.46" dur="5.34">regulations they&amp;#39;re looking for those</text>
  <text start="98.04" dur="5.37">people who are trying to you know not</text>
  <text start="100.8" dur="4.47">pay any type of taxes on the crypto</text>
  <text start="103.41" dur="4.53">currencies and the problem they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="105.27" dur="5.94">having is that the system and all these</text>
  <text start="107.94" dur="6.15">platforms they don&amp;#39;t exist in the United</text>
  <text start="111.21" dur="6.6">States many of them are outside of the</text>
  <text start="114.09" dur="6.99">United States and these markets span</text>
  <text start="117.81" dur="5.16">national borders and significant</text>
  <text start="121.08" dur="3.539">training may occur on systems and</text>
  <text start="122.97" dur="4.95">platforms outside of the United States</text>
  <text start="124.619" dur="6.541">and this is a huge problem well it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="127.92" dur="8.399">huge problem for certain governments but</text>
  <text start="131.16" dur="7.59">for those people who are looking to get</text>
  <text start="136.319" dur="4.591">away from controlled currency those</text>
  <text start="138.75" dur="4.61">people who are looking to get away from</text>
  <text start="140.91" dur="5.61">the central banking system</text>
  <text start="143.36" dur="6.13">cryptocurrencies is giving them that</text>
  <text start="146.52" dur="4.44">opportunity and I think and I know</text>
  <text start="149.49" dur="4.26">there&amp;#39;s people out there making the case</text>
  <text start="150.96" dur="4.8">that the bankers are controlling and</text>
  <text start="153.75" dur="5.13">they created the crypto currencies well</text>
  <text start="155.76" dur="5.85">if that was the case and they were fully</text>
  <text start="158.88" dur="3.84">controlling the crypto currencies they</text>
  <text start="161.61" dur="2.849">would have had all these regulations</text>
  <text start="162.72" dur="4.26">they would have had everything in place</text>
  <text start="164.459" dur="4.381">it wouldn&amp;#39;t be decentralized like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="166.98" dur="3.78">seeing right now they would have full</text>
  <text start="168.84" dur="5.46">control and they wouldn&amp;#39;t put a limit on</text>
  <text start="170.76" dur="6.24">how much could could be created because</text>
  <text start="174.3" dur="5.1">this would actually hurt them in the end</text>
  <text start="177" dur="5.459">and you have to remember the central</text>
  <text start="179.4" dur="4.89">bankers their entire system is based on</text>
  <text start="182.459" dur="4.11">debt so they would have to attach</text>
  <text start="184.29" dur="4.619">interest to the crypto</text>
  <text start="186.569" dur="4.53">currency&amp;#39;s because it makes no sense to</text>
  <text start="188.909" dur="5.34">create the currency without interest</text>
  <text start="191.099" dur="4.711">they don&amp;#39;t make a profit that way yes</text>
  <text start="194.249" dur="4.08">the trading fees and things like that</text>
  <text start="195.81" dur="6.06">but they&amp;#39;re looking for control they</text>
  <text start="198.329" dur="7.5">they have enough wealth they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="201.87" dur="5.91">looking to own crypto currencies just</text>
  <text start="205.829" dur="4.591">like they&amp;#39;re not looking to own dollars</text>
  <text start="207.78" dur="5.519">they create this out of thin air they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="210.42" dur="6.299">looking to to own hard assets and they</text>
  <text start="213.299" dur="5.64">would never create something out of thin</text>
  <text start="216.719" dur="6.42">air where they wouldn&amp;#39;t attach interest</text>
  <text start="218.939" dur="6.75">to it think about it go back to 1913 the</text>
  <text start="223.139" dur="5.041">government at that point in time had to</text>
  <text start="225.689" dur="4.83">borrow from the central bank if you go</text>
  <text start="228.18" dur="3.839">back even further than that to the other</text>
  <text start="230.519" dur="3.661">central banks the United States and even</text>
  <text start="232.019" dur="4.53">to the United Kingdom and going back in</text>
  <text start="234.18" dur="4.919">time every single central bank they</text>
  <text start="236.549" dur="7.41">created currency and the government had</text>
  <text start="239.099" dur="7.11">to borrow the currency here there is no</text>
  <text start="243.959" dur="4.95">interest this is how you know the</text>
  <text start="246.209" dur="4.5">central bank&amp;#39;s aren&amp;#39;t involved this is</text>
  <text start="248.909" dur="3.98">how you know they&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="250.709" dur="5.041">controlling this plus it&amp;#39;s decentralized</text>
  <text start="252.889" dur="7.181">we see right now that there are bubbles</text>
  <text start="255.75" dur="7.02">all over the place and the conventional</text>
  <text start="260.07" dur="5.42">investment wisdom holds that central</text>
  <text start="262.77" dur="6.03">banks will never let markets decline and</text>
  <text start="265.49" dur="5.649">this is a very interesting belief given</text>
  <text start="268.8" dur="3.48">that two previous asset bubbles based on</text>
  <text start="271.139" dur="5.041">central bank easy money</text>
  <text start="272.28" dur="7.62">both imploded impoverishing believers in</text>
  <text start="276.18" dur="6.51">central bank omnipotence now if we go</text>
  <text start="279.9" dur="4.5">back in time we had the dot-com bubble</text>
  <text start="282.69" dur="5.46">which imploded</text>
  <text start="284.4" dur="6.48">we had the housing bubble which imploded</text>
  <text start="288.15" dur="8.63">and we are now in the central bankers</text>
  <text start="290.88" dur="8.67">bubble which will eventually implode now</text>
  <text start="296.78" dur="6.069">when we look at these bubbles we</text>
  <text start="299.55" dur="5.64">understand that the central bank&amp;#39;s blow</text>
  <text start="302.849" dur="5.931">them up and then they let them go and</text>
  <text start="305.19" dur="7.92">they try to steal everyone&amp;#39;s wealth and</text>
  <text start="308.78" dur="7.48">they try to enact additional laws to</text>
  <text start="313.11" dur="4.71">benefit themselves and when we look at</text>
  <text start="316.26" dur="3.779">this we could see this is what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="317.82" dur="3.839">been doing for a very long time</text>
  <text start="320.039" dur="4.201">and for those people who believe that</text>
  <text start="321.659" dur="5.581">this next bubble is not going to occur</text>
  <text start="324.24" dur="8.099">well they&amp;#39;ve they&amp;#39;re doing the same</text>
  <text start="327.24" dur="9.209">exact thing they&amp;#39;re pushing the bubble</text>
  <text start="332.339" dur="6.961">up and up and up by manipulating the</text>
  <text start="336.449" dur="5.34">entire market so we can say that the</text>
  <text start="339.3" dur="4.709">conventional investment wisdom holds</text>
  <text start="341.789" dur="4.86">that any asset bubble that burst will</text>
  <text start="344.009" dur="5.28">quickly be reflate &amp;#39;add into an even</text>
  <text start="346.649" dur="5.45">more extreme asset bubble that certainly</text>
  <text start="349.289" dur="5.37">been the history of the past 17 years</text>
  <text start="352.099" dur="5.261">but there&amp;#39;s a case to be made that</text>
  <text start="354.659" dur="7.831">bubbles are like strikes and you only</text>
  <text start="357.36" dur="8.16">get three and Charles Hughes Smith is</text>
  <text start="362.49" dur="6.06">out there saying that these are the</text>
  <text start="365.52" dur="6.209">three bubbles and you&amp;#39;re out every</text>
  <text start="368.55" dur="6.359">policy yields diminishing returns as the</text>
  <text start="371.729" dur="5.52">positive results follow an s-curve what</text>
  <text start="374.909" dur="5.25">every trader knows no longer has any</text>
  <text start="377.249" dur="5.34">predictive power and number three policy</text>
  <text start="380.159" dur="4.34">extremes have become normalized leaving</text>
  <text start="382.589" dur="4.29">central banks with unintended and</text>
  <text start="384.499" dur="4.6">unpredictable consequences should they</text>
  <text start="386.879" dur="5.4">push even more extreme policies in the</text>
  <text start="389.099" dur="5.28">next bubble burst radical new central</text>
  <text start="392.279" dur="4.591">bank policies work wonders in the</text>
  <text start="394.379" dur="4.171">initial booze phase but over time the</text>
  <text start="396.87" dur="6.449">novelty and the effectiveness of the</text>
  <text start="398.55" dur="7.289">radical policies completely wear off the</text>
  <text start="403.319" dur="4.2">third dynamic is that central banks are</text>
  <text start="405.839" dur="3.39">visibly getting nervous about their</text>
  <text start="407.519" dur="4.13">unintended and unpredictable</text>
  <text start="409.229" dur="5.34">consequences of their extreme policies</text>
  <text start="411.649" dur="4.961">policy extremes trigger unintended</text>
  <text start="414.569" dur="5.28">consequences as a result of being</text>
  <text start="416.61" dur="6.959">extreme you can&amp;#39;t throw around trillions</text>
  <text start="419.849" dur="6.24">and nap generate expectations incentives</text>
  <text start="423.569" dur="4.97">and blowback from those who don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="426.089" dur="4.98">benefit from the extreme policies</text>
  <text start="428.539" dur="4.84">central banks don&amp;#39;t control the</text>
  <text start="431.069" dur="4.71">consequences of their policies once</text>
  <text start="433.379" dur="4.35">markets grasp at the central bank have</text>
  <text start="435.779" dur="4.68">lost control of the consequences of</text>
  <text start="437.729" dur="5.55">their policies confidence faith and</text>
  <text start="440.459" dur="6.18">trust in central bank&amp;#39;s saving the day</text>
  <text start="443.279" dur="7.2">will completely evaporate and we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="446.639" dur="5.7">this happen before in other bubbles when</text>
  <text start="450.479" dur="3.09">people look at this and say oh we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="452.339" dur="3.181">having problems here</text>
  <text start="453.569" dur="3.3">and they start to lose faith they</text>
  <text start="455.52" dur="4.379">started looked losing faith in the</text>
  <text start="456.869" dur="4.651">housing market the interest rate started</text>
  <text start="459.899" dur="3.901">to rise people saw what was happening</text>
  <text start="461.52" dur="4.379">people started losing jobs the subprime</text>
  <text start="463.8" dur="3.599">securities we found out they were fake</text>
  <text start="465.899" dur="3.51">phony and false they weren&amp;#39;t triple-a</text>
  <text start="467.399" dur="5.461">rated that were filled with junk loans</text>
  <text start="469.409" dur="6.84">and everything fell apart once people</text>
  <text start="472.86" dur="6.119">start to realize that the stock market</text>
  <text start="476.249" dur="6.12">has been manipulated and kept up with</text>
  <text start="478.979" dur="5.34">central bank&amp;#39;s buying tech stocks well</text>
  <text start="482.369" dur="3.931">they&amp;#39;re gonna lose faith in that when</text>
  <text start="484.319" dur="3.421">people start to realize that the housing</text>
  <text start="486.3" dur="4.079">market has been pumped up by the central</text>
  <text start="487.74" dur="6.299">bank only in 20 cities and the corporate</text>
  <text start="490.379" dur="6.391">media fed this to the entire country to</text>
  <text start="494.039" dur="6.481">the rest of the world and a lot of the</text>
  <text start="496.77" dur="5.189">easy money was invested in housing where</text>
  <text start="500.52" dur="4.049">hedge funds and investment companies</text>
  <text start="501.959" dur="5.61">were purchasing thousands upon thousands</text>
  <text start="504.569" dur="5.31">of homes and they were told to keep them</text>
  <text start="507.569" dur="4.11">off the market rent them if you can but</text>
  <text start="509.879" dur="3.991">make sure that there&amp;#39;s no inventory in</text>
  <text start="511.679" dur="5.131">the market this is when people start to</text>
  <text start="513.87" dur="4.649">realize we&amp;#39;ve been fooled and this is</text>
  <text start="516.81" dur="4.169">when people lose faith and this is when</text>
  <text start="518.519" dur="4.56">the system comes crashing down now</text>
  <text start="520.979" dur="3.991">yesterday we talked about inflation</text>
  <text start="523.079" dur="4.291">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about inflation quite</text>
  <text start="524.97" dur="3.57">a bit and I said this would be one of</text>
  <text start="527.37" dur="3.269">the signals that would tell us that</text>
  <text start="528.54" dur="4.62">we&amp;#39;re headed down the path where the</text>
  <text start="530.639" dur="4.44">central banks are losing control that</text>
  <text start="533.16" dur="3.96">the system starting to break apart and</text>
  <text start="535.079" dur="5.94">you would see this in the stores but</text>
  <text start="537.12" dur="6.81">we&amp;#39;re already seeing signs of this in US</text>
  <text start="541.019" dur="5.07">producer prices now before I get to that</text>
  <text start="543.93" dur="4.649">we need to look at Saudi Arabia right</text>
  <text start="546.089" dur="7.05">now because they&amp;#39;re planning to hike</text>
  <text start="548.579" dur="9.18">their oil prices by eighty percent forty</text>
  <text start="553.139" dur="8.491">four cents per liter now what this means</text>
  <text start="557.759" dur="5.76">is that it&amp;#39;s going to cost more to fill</text>
  <text start="561.63" dur="3.72">up at the gas station it&amp;#39;s going to cost</text>
  <text start="563.519" dur="4.5">more to deliver the products now</text>
  <text start="565.35" dur="6.419">remember when the United States the</text>
  <text start="568.019" dur="5.49">Cabal had Saudi Arabia push out a lot of</text>
  <text start="571.769" dur="4.05">oil which dropped the prices now they</text>
  <text start="573.509" dur="3.841">were doing two things maybe maybe more</text>
  <text start="575.819" dur="4.471">than two but two that we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="577.35" dur="6.33">recognize right now one to put a lot of</text>
  <text start="580.29" dur="7.169">pressure on Russia and hopefully destroy</text>
  <text start="583.68" dur="6.149">their economy didn&amp;#39;t work secondly</text>
  <text start="587.459" dur="5.011">wanted to put more spending money in the</text>
  <text start="589.829" dur="5.31">pockets of the people because they were</text>
  <text start="592.47" dur="4.529">hoping that these people of the united</text>
  <text start="595.139" dur="5.31">states would go out and spend it in</text>
  <text start="596.999" dur="6.06">retail it didn&amp;#39;t happen it also brought</text>
  <text start="600.449" dur="4.14">prices down and this is one of the ways</text>
  <text start="603.059" dur="4.291">that they controlled inflation because</text>
  <text start="604.589" dur="5.04">as they dropped the fuel prices prices</text>
  <text start="607.35" dur="3.599">on food and other products did come down</text>
  <text start="609.629" dur="3.45">a little bit but not much</text>
  <text start="610.949" dur="4.23">but allowed companies to bring the</text>
  <text start="613.079" dur="5.13">prices down just a little bit but still</text>
  <text start="615.179" dur="6.78">make a huge profit on the products now</text>
  <text start="618.209" dur="8.6">if fuel goes up we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="621.959" dur="7.19">inflation on food prices on products and</text>
  <text start="626.809" dur="5.111">this is going to hurt the economy</text>
  <text start="629.149" dur="6.04">further and we&amp;#39;re starting to see this</text>
  <text start="631.92" dur="7.259">now the u.s. producer prices well it</text>
  <text start="635.189" dur="7.43">looks like they have surged and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="639.179" dur="5.88">gone up to 3.1 percent year-on-year and</text>
  <text start="642.619" dur="5.56">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now that this is</text>
  <text start="645.059" dur="7.44">a the biggest jump since 2011</text>
  <text start="648.179" dur="7.35">now once inflation starts to rise the</text>
  <text start="652.499" dur="5.791">central banks will not be able to</text>
  <text start="655.529" dur="5.011">control it and what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing is</text>
  <text start="658.29" dur="6.029">that the PPI final demand year over year</text>
  <text start="660.54" dur="5.099">has been rising since 2015 now I know</text>
  <text start="664.319" dur="3.51">the central bank is trying to convince</text>
  <text start="665.639" dur="3.901">us that they&amp;#39;re the ones who&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="667.829" dur="5.461">doing this but what is happening right</text>
  <text start="669.54" dur="5.759">now as countries are moving away from</text>
  <text start="673.29" dur="4.409">the dollar not using the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="675.299" dur="5.25">these dollars are coming back to the</text>
  <text start="677.699" dur="5.01">United States and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="680.549" dur="5.85">that now and eventually we were going to</text>
  <text start="682.709" dur="6.961">see the effect of all of this now we</text>
