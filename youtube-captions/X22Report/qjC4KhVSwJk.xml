  <text start="109.15" dur="4.35">stock market&amp;#39;s like a balloon and I know</text>
  <text start="111.94" dur="4.05">if people say bubble I like to say</text>
  <text start="113.5" dur="5.04">balloon you&amp;#39;re either blowing it up with</text>
  <text start="115.99" dur="5.07">your mouth or pump and the structure of</text>
  <text start="118.54" dur="3.63">the balloon can just take so much but</text>
  <text start="121.06" dur="2.669">yes you know let&amp;#39;s make the balloon</text>
  <text start="122.17" dur="3.15">bigger let&amp;#39;s make the balloon bigger</text>

  <text start="125.32" dur="3.359">the balloon bigger and it continually</text>
  <text start="127.39" dur="4.429">gets bigger and bigger and bigger until</text>
  <text start="128.679" dur="6.6">the structure cannot take the force and</text>
  <text start="131.819" dur="5.68">it eventually just pops and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="135.279" dur="5.1">end of it and that&amp;#39;s what I really feel</text>
  <text start="137.499" dur="3.491">that we&amp;#39;re having right now I I mean</text>
  <text start="140.379" dur="3.191">there</text>
  <text start="140.99" dur="4.98">the Fed is printing money it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="143.57" dur="3.75">propping up I&amp;#39;m being decides printing</text>
  <text start="145.97" dur="3.42">money and all the money is going to the</text>
  <text start="147.32" dur="3.81">banks it&amp;#39;s not going to the people it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="149.39" dur="4.38">not going anywhere except they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="151.13" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re taking that money and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="153.77" dur="4.5">reinvesting into the equity market to</text>
  <text start="155.72" dur="5.4">prop up the stock market that&amp;#39;s I mean</text>
  <text start="158.27" dur="6.42">pretty much it and the Fed is also</text>
  <text start="161.12" dur="6.81">propping up the real estate because the</text>
  <text start="164.69" dur="5.43">the banks have a lot of foreclosures on</text>
  <text start="167.93" dur="4.35">their books which you know they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="170.12" dur="3.15">they&amp;#39;re not reporting yet but what</text>
  <text start="172.28" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="173.27" dur="6.54">to get the real estate prices back up so</text>
  <text start="175.79" dur="6.06">they can get rid and sell the real</text>
  <text start="179.81" dur="3.54">estate at the higher price so they can</text>
  <text start="181.85" dur="2.73">get rid of it they don&amp;#39;t want to sell at</text>
  <text start="183.35" dur="3.27">the low price they want to sell it the</text>
  <text start="184.58" dur="3.54">high price and that&amp;#39;s what I believe</text>
  <text start="186.62" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re really doing right now</text>
  <text start="188.12" dur="5.79">and you know and this is going to go on</text>

  <text start="214.94" dur="5.61">again the set is not part of the</text>
  <text start="216.77" dur="5.91">government we cannot audit them it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="220.55" dur="4.83">just it&amp;#39;s a private corporation so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="222.68" dur="4.5">like it&amp;#39;s you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like</text>
