  <text start="132.95" dur="4.93">electronics phone systems and they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="137.88" dur="6.03">this to go after terrorism and we know</text>
  <text start="141.39" dur="3.96">this is a violation of our rights they</text>
  <text start="143.91" dur="6.23">have no right to do this without a</text>
  <text start="145.35" dur="8.669">warrant an apple today the Apple CEO</text>
  <text start="150.14" dur="9.49">says encryption is a must in today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="154.019" dur="8.251">world there will be no back door and I</text>
  <text start="159.63" dur="4.829">hope they hold to this because if</text>
  <text start="162.27" dur="5.04">everyone finds out they lied</text>
  <text start="164.459" dur="7.31">it&amp;#39;s going to be a problem but Apple has</text>
  <text start="167.31" dur="6.81">reaffirmed its promised not to bake</text>
  <text start="171.769" dur="4.72">encryption backdoors into its products</text>
  <text start="174.12" dur="6.899">just like the NSA wants just like the</text>
  <text start="176.489" dur="6.75">FBI FBI wants the decision marks a</text>
  <text start="181.019" dur="4.351">victory for privacy advocates and a</text>
  <text start="183.239" dur="5.491">rejection of the government&amp;#39;s goal of</text>
  <text start="185.37" dur="6.33">obtaining encryption keys the CEO said</text>
  <text start="188.73" dur="6.989">we think encryption is a must in today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="191.7" dur="6.42">world no backdoor is a must do we want</text>
  <text start="195.719" dur="4.981">our nation to be secured of course said</text>
  <text start="198.12" dur="5.94">Cooke no one should have to decide</text>
  <text start="200.7" dur="5.789">between privacy or security I think one</text>
  <text start="204.06" dur="6.12">of our founding fathers said that we</text>
  <text start="206.489" dur="5.881">should be smart enough to do both both</text>
  <text start="210.18" dur="6.239">of these things are essentially part of</text>
  <text start="212.37" dur="6.929">the Constitution and the FBI said ok</text>
  <text start="216.419" dur="5.371">we&amp;#39;re not going to go and continue on</text>
  <text start="219.299" dur="4.89">with the backdoors we&amp;#39;re gonna work with</text>
  <text start="221.79" dur="4.77">the companies and they&amp;#39;ll just hand over</text>
  <text start="224.189" dur="3.931">all the information we want now how are</text>
  <text start="226.56" dur="4.5">they going to do this well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="228.12" dur="6.209">pushing sisse where companies would just</text>
  <text start="231.06" dur="6.12">hand over the information and they will</text>
  <text start="234.329" dur="6.12">not be held liable and this is what the</text>
  <text start="237.18" dur="6.649">FBI Obama administration this is what</text>
  <text start="240.449" dur="6.69">they&amp;#39;re trying to push right now and</text>
  <text start="243.829" dur="8.231">Cooke went on to say that if we had</text>
  <text start="247.139" dur="7.011">backdoors you know there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="252.06" dur="5.72">backdoors in for the bad guys and</text>
  <text start="254.15" dur="6.609">backdoors in for the good guys which</text>
  <text start="257.78" dur="8.8">basically means you&amp;#39;re spying on</text>
  <text start="260.759" dur="8.13">everybody and in this world it should</text>
  <text start="266.58" dur="4.41">just be blocked from everyone and they</text>
  <text start="268.889" dur="3.27">should find another way just like if</text>
  <text start="270.99" dur="4.95">they wanted to come into your house</text>
  <text start="272.159" dur="5.431">they&amp;#39;d have to get a warrant then they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="275.94" dur="5.4">have to walk into the house physically</text>
  <text start="277.59" dur="10.56">to look around the same thing should be</text>
  <text start="281.34" dur="8.73">with electronics no difference and this</text>
  <text start="288.15" dur="6.03">is why you need to protect yourself yes</text>
  <text start="290.07" dur="6.839">Apple is doing something and they should</text>
  <text start="294.18" dur="4.15">be doing this because otherwise it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="296.909" dur="3.85">violation of our rights</text>
  <text start="298.33" dur="6.57">but everyone needs to not depend on</text>
  <text start="300.759" dur="7.081">companies not depend on government we</text>
  <text start="304.9" dur="7.65">all need to depend on ourselves and this</text>
  <text start="307.84" dur="8.669">is why you need to use encryption use an</text>
  <text start="312.55" dur="6.839">email encryption service use let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="316.509" dur="5.13">start page to do your searches on the</text>
  <text start="319.389" dur="3.951">web which will plug into Google and give</text>
  <text start="321.639" dur="4.131">you the results the difference is</text>
  <text start="323.34" dur="5.109">they&amp;#39;re not keeping track of your</text>
  <text start="325.77" dur="5.709">searches you can use a product like</text>
  <text start="328.449" dur="5.791">block of pocket which is a sleeve which</text>
  <text start="331.479" dur="5.461">you can slide your phone your iPad you</text>
  <text start="334.24" dur="5.31">can slide your credit card in your</text>
  <text start="336.94" dur="5.009">driver&amp;#39;s license because these cards are</text>
  <text start="339.55" dur="4.89">going to have RFID chips most of them do</text>
  <text start="341.949" dur="4.351">already and people walking down the</text>
  <text start="344.44" dur="5.52">street with a scanner can steal your</text>
  <text start="346.3" dur="5.94">information the sleeve which is a</text>
  <text start="349.96" dur="7.139">material and it&amp;#39;s interim with copper</text>
  <text start="352.24" dur="7.32">silver blocks the signal so crooks</text>
  <text start="357.099" dur="4.261">cannot find out your information it</text>
  <text start="359.56" dur="3.84">blocks the signal from your phone so you</text>
  <text start="361.36" dur="4.109">can&amp;#39;t be tracked it blocks the signal so</text>
  <text start="363.4" dur="4.47">you don&amp;#39;t get the radiation from the</text>
  <text start="365.469" dur="6.331">phone now out in Afghanistan we</text>
  <text start="367.87" dur="6.539">understand the u.s. flew in and bombed a</text>
  <text start="371.8" dur="3.899">hospital in Afghanistan and that was the</text>
  <text start="374.409" dur="2.85">Doctors Without Borders</text>
  <text start="375.699" dur="4.83">they were working in the hospital and</text>
  <text start="377.259" dur="4.291">conduce and there were a lot of excuses</text>
  <text start="380.529" dur="3.11">coming out of the United States</text>
  <text start="381.55" dur="4.32">government central bankers and</text>
  <text start="383.639" dur="5.89">eventually what they did is they paid</text>
  <text start="385.87" dur="6.87">off the people in that disaster and then</text>
  <text start="389.529" dur="6.45">they had a team come in and drive a tank</text>
  <text start="392.74" dur="6.329">and destroy a lot of the evidence now it</text>
  <text start="395.979" dur="6.18">has been revealed that the DCG asked a</text>
  <text start="399.069" dur="6.69">distributed common ground system was</text>
  <text start="402.159" dur="6.51">down during the recent attack and this</text>
  <text start="405.759" dur="5.011">is why the attack happened so the system</text>
  <text start="408.669" dur="7.17">was down but they decided to go ahead</text>
  <text start="410.77" dur="7.649">with the attack anyway so again the</text>
  <text start="415.839" dur="4.531">story doesn&amp;#39;t make sense of course</text>
  <text start="418.419" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re blaming it on faulty electronics</text>
  <text start="420.37" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re saying it wasn&amp;#39;t working at the</text>
  <text start="422.229" dur="4.68">time so maybe they should have held off</text>
  <text start="424.33" dur="6.36">until they were absolutely sure of what</text>
  <text start="426.909" dur="4.861">was going on now in Canada they had</text>
  <text start="430.69" dur="3.2">elections there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="431.77" dur="5.07">new Prime Minister that was elected</text>
  <text start="433.89" dur="7.32">prime minister justin trudeau</text>
  <text start="436.84" dur="8.34">and he went on the campaign trail</text>
  <text start="441.21" dur="7.62">basically saying he will bring home the</text>
  <text start="445.18" dur="7.2">canadian fighter jets he will stop and</text>
  <text start="448.83" dur="6.07">remove the troops from Syria and Iraq</text>
  <text start="452.38" dur="5.16">yes we might have to keep some advisers</text>
  <text start="454.9" dur="5.46">there and he&amp;#39;s already telling Obama</text>
  <text start="457.54" dur="5.79">listen we&amp;#39;re going to withdraw fighter</text>
  <text start="460.36" dur="6.99">jets from Syria and Iraq we will no</text>
  <text start="463.33" dur="5.58">longer be working with you in these</text>
  <text start="467.35" dur="4.86">countries now we&amp;#39;re gonna have to see if</text>
  <text start="468.91" dur="5.43">he follows through on this so basically</text>
  <text start="472.21" dur="4.44">what he&amp;#39;s saying is Canada will no</text>
  <text start="474.34" dur="4.86">longer fly missions in these countries</text>
  <text start="476.65" dur="6.87">now other countries might be looking at</text>
  <text start="479.2" dur="6.72">this saying hmm if Canada is not going</text>
  <text start="483.52" dur="6.15">to do this why are we still doing this</text>
  <text start="485.92" dur="6.33">and this might start a domino effect and</text>
  <text start="489.67" dur="5.55">other countries might say well Russia is</text>
  <text start="492.25" dur="5.31">inside of Syria is there any reason for</text>
  <text start="495.22" dur="6.96">us to be here and we might see the</text>
  <text start="497.56" dur="8.28">coalition fall apart now Iraq&amp;#39;s ruling</text>
  <text start="502.18" dur="8.13">bloc wants Russian airstrikes in their</text>
  <text start="505.84" dur="6.36">country Al Motta Lavvy pointed to</text>
  <text start="510.31" dur="5.37">information received from US sources</text>
  <text start="512.2" dur="5.52">which stated that 75 percent of American</text>
  <text start="515.68" dur="4.8">warplanes returned to base without</text>
  <text start="517.72" dur="6.66">firing their weapons against the Islamic</text>
  <text start="520.48" dur="6.3">state targets so they&amp;#39;re just flying</text>
  <text start="524.38" dur="4.61">around and they&amp;#39;re not hitting the</text>
  <text start="526.78" dur="4.44">Islamic state whatsoever which we knew</text>
  <text start="528.99" dur="7.75">that this is what they were doing</text>
  <text start="531.22" dur="9.42">Iraq is also spotted UK United States</text>
  <text start="536.74" dur="5.48">and other nations dropping supplies for</text>
  <text start="540.64" dur="4.41">the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="542.22" dur="5.05">so Iraq right now is sitting here saying</text>
  <text start="545.05" dur="5.7">why do we have the United States in our</text>
  <text start="547.27" dur="4.28">country Russia in Syria is taking care</text>
  <text start="550.75" dur="5.37">of business</text>
  <text start="551.55" dur="8.61">maybe we need Russia in here we see</text>
  <text start="556.12" dur="8.06">Assad has left Syria and he is visiting</text>
  <text start="560.16" dur="5.82">Putin in Russia and</text>
  <text start="564.18" dur="5.85">they&amp;#39;re talking about how well the</text>
  <text start="565.98" dur="7.98">campaign is going how Assad is taking</text>
  <text start="570.03" dur="6.21">back more and more of his country and</text>
  <text start="573.96" dur="5.85">there is a message out there coming from</text>

  <text start="751.699" dur="6.661">able to shoot it down by their guided</text>
  <text start="755.269" dur="6.961">interceptors with the help of tracking</text>
  <text start="758.36" dur="8.61">from allied ships so what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="762.23" dur="8.729">is they&amp;#39;re simulating a ballistic</text>
  <text start="766.97" dur="7.309">missile and they took it down with their</text>
  <text start="770.959" dur="7.951">standard missile-3 a guided interceptor</text>
  <text start="774.279" dur="7.56">and it hit the ballistic missile now the</text>
  <text start="778.91" dur="6.359">question is is this ballistic missile</text>
  <text start="781.839" dur="6.101">like the Russian ballistic missile</text>
  <text start="785.269" dur="7.141">because their ballistic missiles can</text>
  <text start="787.94" dur="9.54">maneuver change course even though it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="792.41" dur="8.13">set on a trajectory it can change it can</text>
  <text start="797.48" dur="6.27">maneuver I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;ve done that</text>
  <text start="800.54" dur="4.919">test because I don&amp;#39;t think the United</text>
  <text start="803.75" dur="4.38">States government central bankers have</text>
  <text start="805.459" dur="4.801">this type of weapon they&amp;#39;re developing</text>
  <text start="808.13" dur="4.34">it but I don&amp;#39;t think they have it just</text>
  <text start="810.26" dur="8.809">yet</text>
  <text start="812.47" dur="14.979">NATO begins a dress rehearsal for a</text>

  <text start="844.31" dur="6">designed to prepare NATO powers for</text>
  <text start="846.95" dur="6.18">large scale strategic strategic warfare</text>
  <text start="850.31" dur="6.54">outside the boundaries of NATO countries</text>
  <text start="853.13" dur="5.31">the main focus of the NATO drills is to</text>
  <text start="856.85" dur="4.739">prepare for comprehensive strategic</text>
  <text start="858.44" dur="6.83">warfare spanning broad stretches of the</text>

  <text start="865.27" dur="4.75">emphasizing large-scale maneuver warfare</text>
  <text start="867.649" dur="7.981">to a degree not seen since the</text>
  <text start="870.02" dur="9.6">dissolution of the Soviet Union hmm so</text>
  <text start="875.63" dur="10.04">what are they actually doing they are</text>
  <text start="879.62" dur="9.6">preparing for World War 3 because</text>
  <text start="885.67" dur="7.65">general Philip Breedlove says the</text>
  <text start="889.22" dur="9.77">following Trident juncture sends a very</text>
  <text start="893.32" dur="9.639">clear message to any potential aggressor</text>
  <text start="898.99" dur="6.67">any attempt to violate the sovereignty</text>
  <text start="902.959" dur="6.591">of one of NATO nations will result in a</text>
  <text start="905.66" dur="9.15">decisive military engagement of all NATO</text>
  <text start="909.55" dur="8.38">nations now the question is what</text>
  <text start="914.81" dur="6.27">aggressor are they talking about what</text>
  <text start="917.93" dur="8.19">country or countries are out there right</text>
  <text start="921.08" dur="7.47">now that are such a threat well we know</text>
  <text start="926.12" dur="5.13">what they&amp;#39;re doing here they&amp;#39;re planning</text>
  <text start="928.55" dur="3.87">for world war 3 they&amp;#39;re planning to go</text>
  <text start="931.25" dur="4.709">up against China</text>
  <text start="932.42" dur="4.859">Russia North Korea they are training</text>
  <text start="935.959" dur="5">right now</text>
  <text start="937.279" dur="8.971">for this they are preparing and getting</text>
  <text start="940.959" dur="8.891">ready because as we get closer and</text>
  <text start="946.25" dur="5.579">closer to the collapse what do we see we</text>
  <text start="949.85" dur="4.32">see the provocations against other</text>
  <text start="951.829" dur="4.591">countries we see military assets being</text>
  <text start="954.17" dur="6.419">maneuvered maneuvered all around the</text>
  <text start="956.42" dur="6.61">world and we see them preparing and</text>
  <text start="960.589" dur="7.331">training for it</text>
  <text start="963.03" dur="9.09">so we see the collapse and then we see</text>
  <text start="967.92" dur="7.95">the rise of the military all at the same</text>
  <text start="972.12" dur="6.6">time now the FBI director is out there</text>
  <text start="975.87" dur="6.27">and they are saying and that are</text>
  <text start="978.72" dur="4.86">reporting this today along with the</text>
  <text start="982.14" dur="4.35">Department of Homeland Security that</text>
  <text start="983.58" dur="6.33">they have detained some 70 persons</text>
  <text start="986.49" dur="6.54">related not the Islamic state related to</text>
  <text start="989.91" dur="4.71">the Islamic state and they reported this</text>
  <text start="993.03" dur="6.3">to the US House Committee on Homeland</text>
  <text start="994.62" dur="6.51">Security so no crime was committed they</text>
  <text start="999.33" dur="6.81">have no evidence of anything of</text>
  <text start="1001.13" dur="7.5">wrongdoing and did they just detain</text>
  <text start="1006.14" dur="6.45">these people to show that yes we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1008.63" dur="7.56">doing our job because most likely these</text>
  <text start="1012.59" dur="4.56">people are going to be set free and they</text>
  <text start="1016.19" dur="4.83">have nothing they haven&amp;#39;t done anything</text>
  <text start="1017.15" dur="7.11">and the people they have stopped were</text>
  <text start="1021.02" dur="7.14">all patsies now the FBI director James</text>
  <text start="1024.26" dur="5.329">Comey is saying that something strange</text>
  <text start="1028.16" dur="6.12">is happening right now</text>
  <text start="1029.589" dur="6.821">he&amp;#39;s seeing four fewer Americans trying</text>
  <text start="1034.28" dur="5.669">to travel abroad to join the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1036.41" dur="6.69">state in the recent months he said he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1039.949" dur="8.541">not sure why this is right now but it</text>
  <text start="1043.1" dur="8.88">could be because the FBI with all its</text>
  <text start="1048.49" dur="6.25">research their tactical teams all the</text>
  <text start="1051.98" dur="4.29">efforts they&amp;#39;ve been putting in to try</text>
  <text start="1054.74" dur="6.72">to stop this might be taking effect</text>
  <text start="1056.27" dur="9.44">right now or maybe Russia right now is</text>
  <text start="1061.46" dur="6.54">in Syria destroying the proxy army and</text>
  <text start="1065.71" dur="4.12">the paid mercenaries are saying you know</text>
  <text start="1068" dur="6.03">something I don&amp;#39;t think we want to go</text>
  <text start="1069.83" dur="9.75">over there right now and we know most of</text>
  <text start="1074.03" dur="8.28">these cases are completely fake phony</text>
  <text start="1079.58" dur="3.83">and false so this has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="1082.31" dur="4.53">the FBI</text>
  <text start="1083.41" dur="5.05">basically this terror group which is the</text>

  <text start="1095.3" dur="3.57">as they were before</text>
  <text start="1096.94" dur="5.26">they&amp;#39;re getting them from different</text>
  <text start="1098.87" dur="5.4">areas but I think as time goes on we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1102.2" dur="4.98">gonna see a lot of them say you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1104.27" dur="4.98">gonna sit this one out not going up</text>
