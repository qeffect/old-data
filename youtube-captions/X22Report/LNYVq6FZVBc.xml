  <text start="140.92" dur="3.02">see what the market does I have a funny</text>
  <text start="142.599" dur="4.921">feeling it&amp;#39;s going to drop even further</text>
  <text start="143.94" dur="6.01">but I could be wrong I think all those</text>
  <text start="147.52" dur="6.39">people with the long positions they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="149.95" dur="6.74">finished and the ppt the the</text>
  <text start="153.91" dur="5.67">high-frequency traders they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="156.69" dur="4.78">pretty much bring it back in line and</text>
  <text start="159.58" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;re going to see it maybe drop a</text>
  <text start="161.47" dur="4.65">little bit I think we&amp;#39;re going to see a</text>
  <text start="163.87" dur="4.47">lot more people sell off but we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="166.12" dur="5.42">to wait and see how this all turns out</text>
  <text start="168.34" dur="7.619">again the whole thing&amp;#39;s manipulated so</text>
  <text start="171.54" dur="9.899">any can go at this point but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="175.959" dur="7.851">seeing is that the entire country is</text>
  <text start="181.439" dur="7.031">divided right now</text>
  <text start="183.81" dur="7.54">we have protests going on we have</text>
  <text start="188.47" dur="7.8">petitions out there we have people for</text>
  <text start="191.35" dur="6.72">Trump with people who hate Trump and we</text>
  <text start="196.27" dur="3.33">can see right now the deep state the</text>
  <text start="198.07" dur="5.66">central bankers they&amp;#39;re doing whatever</text>
  <text start="199.6" dur="6.59">they can to create chaos in this country</text>
  <text start="203.73" dur="5.14">because remember they&amp;#39;re sore losers</text>
  <text start="206.19" dur="5.08">they don&amp;#39;t like to lose they like to</text>
  <text start="208.87" dur="5.28">reach their goals they like control and</text>
  <text start="211.27" dur="7.14">when things get out of control they push</text>
  <text start="214.15" dur="6.3">even harder to take control and we can</text>
  <text start="218.41" dur="4.59">see right now that everything was done</text>
  <text start="220.45" dur="5.67">to put Hillary Clinton into office the</text>
  <text start="223" dur="5.31">whole thing was a complete siop when we</text>
  <text start="226.12" dur="3.96">look at the economics of everything we</text>
  <text start="228.31" dur="4.74">see that they lower the unemployment</text>
  <text start="230.08" dur="6.72">rate they raised the GDP actually the</text>
  <text start="233.05" dur="8.19">you Mitch consumer sentiment well this</text>
  <text start="236.8" dur="8.22">survey surged to the highest level since</text>
  <text start="241.24" dur="6.78">mid-2016 and of course they did this for</text>
  <text start="245.02" dur="6.41">the elections and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="248.02" dur="7.25">right now is that the elections are over</text>
  <text start="251.43" dur="6.369">most likely what they&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
  <text start="255.27" dur="6.43">revised the image we might even see a</text>
  <text start="257.799" dur="7.741">tumble in November I&amp;#39;m moving into</text>
  <text start="261.7" dur="7.02">December but we can see right now this</text>
  <text start="265.54" dur="6.24">was pushed up and the reason they cited</text>
  <text start="268.72" dur="6.09">it was pushed up was because people saw</text>
  <text start="271.78" dur="6.87">an improvement in the economy and of</text>
  <text start="274.81" dur="5.13">course they can make the case that GDP</text>
  <text start="278.65" dur="3.03">search to two-point-nine percent</text>
  <text start="279.94" dur="3.9">unemployment came down to four point</text>
  <text start="281.68" dur="5.04">nine percent and of course everyone is</text>
  <text start="283.84" dur="5.34">very confident now but we can see all of</text>
  <text start="286.72" dur="4.68">this was done for the election we can</text>
  <text start="289.18" dur="4.47">see that all of this is an illusion and</text>
  <text start="291.4" dur="6.08">once again when you fact check these</text>
  <text start="293.65" dur="6.78">things if you go to the government or</text>
  <text start="297.48" dur="4.78">Google and a fennec check it against the</text>
  <text start="300.43" dur="7.17">government of the corporate media that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.26" dur="7.95">what you&amp;#39;ll say but once this time</text>
  <text start="307.6" dur="7.02">period is past and everything starts to</text>
  <text start="310.21" dur="6.79">fall apart for those numbers really true</text>
  <text start="314.62" dur="4.75">or were they manipulated once again</text>
  <text start="317" dur="6.6">and this is the problem that we have</text>
  <text start="319.37" dur="7.65">with fact-checking things we saw a gold</text>
  <text start="323.6" dur="6.18">during this period of time during the</text>
  <text start="327.02" dur="6.15">election and after the election well it</text>
  <text start="329.78" dur="6.36">is dropped it has been suppressed there</text>
  <text start="333.17" dur="6.93">were 85 thousand gold future contracts</text>
  <text start="336.14" dur="7.71">which is ten billion dollars thrown at</text>
  <text start="340.1" dur="8.25">the market which brought the gold price</text>
  <text start="343.85" dur="6.18">down to around twelve-thirty and we can</text>
  <text start="348.35" dur="4.92">see that gold has been down now for five</text>
  <text start="350.03" dur="7.139">days in a row and again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="353.27" dur="7.71">suppressing the price of gold giving the</text>
  <text start="357.169" dur="6.841">illusion the economy is doing well why</text>
  <text start="360.98" dur="6.54">are they still doing this well they have</text>
  <text start="364.01" dur="8.58">plans they don&amp;#39;t want the economy to</text>
  <text start="367.52" dur="6.87">fail while Obama is still in office they</text>
  <text start="372.59" dur="3.93">can&amp;#39;t have it fail he&amp;#39;s very worried</text>
  <text start="374.39" dur="5.029">about his legacy but hopefully his</text>
  <text start="376.52" dur="7.14">legacy will be exposed as one big lie</text>
  <text start="379.419" dur="9.331">now during this period we are seeing the</text>
  <text start="383.66" dur="9.319">worst price decline in bonds since 1981</text>
  <text start="388.75" dur="7.51">during the bond market crash total um</text>
  <text start="392.979" dur="5.801">market to market losses are around 1</text>
  <text start="396.26" dur="7.08">trillion dollars right now just two days</text>
  <text start="398.78" dur="7.5">after the presidential election and we</text>
  <text start="403.34" dur="6.12">can see that this economy right now it</text>
  <text start="406.28" dur="7.02">is teetering on a collapse they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="409.46" dur="9.6">holding it together until Obama gets out</text>
  <text start="413.3" dur="10.28">of office we see that Trump he is not</text>
  <text start="419.06" dur="7.47">seeking to fully repeal dodd-frank and</text>
  <text start="423.58" dur="5.68">he kind of opposes the bank bailout</text>
  <text start="426.53" dur="6.389">provision now unlike other parts of</text>
  <text start="429.26" dur="6.39">dodd-frank title 2 is supported by large</text>
  <text start="432.919" dur="5.551">banks they say it is proof that bailouts</text>
  <text start="435.65" dur="4.53">are a thing of a past some Republicans</text>
  <text start="438.47" dur="4.53">who ever would rather put a big</text>
  <text start="440.18" dur="4.95">financial firm through bankruptcy they</text>
  <text start="443" dur="5.099">believe title to as it stands as simply</text>
  <text start="445.13" dur="5.55">a bailout by another name which it</text>
  <text start="448.099" dur="2.91">really is and we can see they created</text>
  <text start="450.68" dur="3.09">these bay</text>
  <text start="451.009" dur="5.31">documents because remember the bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="453.77" dur="4.169">the central banks they protect</text>
  <text start="456.319" dur="4.56">themselves they make sure they have plan</text>
  <text start="457.939" dur="5.76">a plan B Plan C they don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="460.879" dur="5.94">caught without a plan and they make sure</text>
  <text start="463.699" dur="4.94">that everything works for them we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="466.819" dur="5.52">seeing that Trump is pushing for</text>
  <text start="468.639" dur="5.83">glass-steagall and might reintroduce</text>
  <text start="472.339" dur="5.97">this remember this was removed back in</text>
  <text start="474.469" dur="5.641">nineteen ninety nine or so 2000 and what</text>
  <text start="478.309" dur="3.121">it did was it broke down the wall</text>
  <text start="480.11" dur="4.079">between commercial and investment</text>
  <text start="481.43" dur="5.219">banking and then all of a sudden we have</text>
  <text start="484.189" dur="6.181">these subprime securities and things</text>
  <text start="486.649" dur="8.52">didn&amp;#39;t go well after this we can see</text>
  <text start="490.37" dur="7.319">right now the EU has said the TTIP well</text>
  <text start="495.169" dur="5.46">that deal is dead due to trump</text>
  <text start="497.689" dur="4.44">presidency because Obama won&amp;#39;t be there</text>
  <text start="500.629" dur="4.231">to push it he might try to push it</text>
  <text start="502.129" dur="4.53">during this period of time but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="504.86" dur="5.369">think it&amp;#39;s going to go anywhere I think</text>
  <text start="506.659" dur="5.04">it is dead and thank God it is it was if</text>
  <text start="510.229" dur="5.641">this past this would have been a</text>
  <text start="511.699" dur="7.47">complete disaster for this country now</text>
  <text start="515.87" dur="5.399">Brandon Smith from alt market com he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="519.169" dur="4.8">saying that the American people well</text>
  <text start="521.269" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;re not out of the woods just yet he</text>
  <text start="523.969" dur="4.531">says something big is coming and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="527.149" dur="4.981">telling everyone to prepare themselves</text>
  <text start="528.5" dur="4.8">and he did say that the brexit was going</text>
  <text start="532.13" dur="3.09">to happen that people were going to vote</text>
  <text start="533.3" dur="5.25">in a certain way he did say that Trump</text>
  <text start="535.22" dur="4.979">was going to win the election and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="538.55" dur="7.909">saying that Trump is going to be used as</text>
  <text start="540.199" dur="9.901">the scapegoat for this entire collapse</text>
  <text start="546.459" dur="5.711">now i know there&amp;#39;s others like cliff who</text>
  <text start="550.1" dur="3.77">uses predictive linguists who says that</text>
  <text start="552.17" dur="5.669">Trump is not going to be blamed for this</text>
  <text start="553.87" dur="5.829">but we can see that the economy and</text>
  <text start="557.839" dur="3.541">everything that we looked at its we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="559.699" dur="5.281">been tracking it we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on</text>
  <text start="561.38" dur="6.269">it and the economy is in a recession</text>
  <text start="564.98" dur="4.77">right now just because they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="567.649" dur="4.021">announced it does it mean the thing just</text>
  <text start="569.75" dur="4.11">because the stock market doesn&amp;#39;t reflect</text>
  <text start="571.67" dur="4.229">it doesn&amp;#39;t mean the thing because we</text>
  <text start="573.86" dur="3.3">were in a recession back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="575.899" dur="5.94">eight before the stock market even came</text>
  <text start="577.16" dur="7.41">down and what he&amp;#39;s saying is that the</text>
  <text start="581.839" dur="4.051">elites now are preparing</text>
  <text start="584.57" dur="3.77">and everything is ready they have the</text>
  <text start="585.89" dur="7.26">green light to bring down the economy</text>
  <text start="588.34" dur="7.99">and we can see right now that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="593.15" dur="6.57">going to initiate the final collapse of</text>
  <text start="596.33" dur="7.07">the global economy while Trump is an</text>
  <text start="599.72" dur="8.46">office so the time frame right now is</text>
  <text start="603.4" dur="8.05">after January and we&amp;#39;re seeing in the</text>
  <text start="608.18" dur="6.45">next six months or so that this is when</text>
  <text start="611.45" dur="9.33">this entire system will completely break</text>
  <text start="614.63" dur="8.63">apart and we can see that many aspects</text>
  <text start="620.78" dur="7.02">of the economy are going to break down</text>
  <text start="623.26" dur="7.54">we know from bill halter cliff high many</text>
  <text start="627.8" dur="5.21">others David Stockman Jim Rickards many</text>
  <text start="630.8" dur="5.27">others who are saying that Jim Willie</text>
  <text start="633.01" dur="5.47">that the dollar is going to be devalued</text>
  <text start="636.07" dur="6.49">the credit markets are going to freeze</text>
  <text start="638.48" dur="8.04">up cash is going to come it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="642.56" dur="5.22">be hard to get cash and the entire</text>
  <text start="646.52" dur="5.61">situation is going to be horrific</text>
  <text start="647.78" dur="8.91">remember yes we had an election yes we</text>
  <text start="652.13" dur="9.5">have a new president but we still have</text>
  <text start="656.69" dur="8.46">the same problem and now they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="661.63" dur="7.48">because hey we have someone to blame</text>
  <text start="665.15" dur="5.42">right now if Hillary got in she most</text>
  <text start="669.11" dur="3.96">likely would have brought us to war and</text>
  <text start="670.57" dur="5.92">they would have covered that up with war</text>
  <text start="673.07" dur="5.97">is war still in the cards well I believe</text>
  <text start="676.49" dur="4.77">that the deep state central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="679.04" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re going to continually push for</text>
  <text start="681.26" dur="7.68">this because remember their goals is to</text>
  <text start="684.05" dur="9.09">reduce the population their goal is to</text>
  <text start="688.94" dur="6.18">create a whole new system and we can see</text>
  <text start="693.14" dur="5.55">right now that they don&amp;#39;t really give up</text>
  <text start="695.12" dur="5.67">on their goals that easily so what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="698.69" dur="5.46">saying to everyone right now is that</text>
  <text start="700.79" dur="6.57">we&amp;#39;re entering a situation an area of</text>
  <text start="704.15" dur="6.56">time where you have this window to</text>
  <text start="707.36" dur="6.3">prepare and I believe at this point</text>
  <text start="710.71" dur="5.73">there is no reason to keep the illusion</text>
  <text start="713.66" dur="4.71">going because once Trump is in office</text>
  <text start="716.44" dur="8.92">they don&amp;#39;t need to keep deal</text>
  <text start="718.37" dur="8.99">life they want someone to blame if they</text>
  <text start="725.36" dur="4.44">can&amp;#39;t blame another country or group</text>
  <text start="727.36" dur="5.95">they&amp;#39;ll blame an individual they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="729.8" dur="7.44">care as long as they&amp;#39;re not blamed for</text>
  <text start="733.31" dur="8.52">what is about to happen and we can see</text>
  <text start="737.24" dur="6.68">that when this hits this is going to be</text>
  <text start="741.83" dur="9.39">something that we&amp;#39;ve never seen before</text>
  <text start="743.92" dur="10.09">and I I can just see it in my mind where</text>
  <text start="751.22" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s going to be so horrific that many</text>
  <text start="754.01" dur="4.2">people are not going to be able to</text>
  <text start="755.3" dur="4.89">handle this you think the people are</text>
  <text start="758.21" dur="6.69">having a problem with the elections wait</text>
  <text start="760.19" dur="6.99">until the collapse occurs their mind the</text>
