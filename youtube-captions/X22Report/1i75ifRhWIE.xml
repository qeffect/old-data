  <text start="63.94" dur="4.62">and the title of the episode is there is</text>
  <text start="66.25" dur="5.16">a coordinated effort to create hysteria</text>
  <text start="68.56" dur="6.03">design to instill fear and change the</text>
  <text start="71.41" dur="5.19">narrative let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="74.59" dur="4.32">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="76.6" dur="5.04">now we know the deep state they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="78.91" dur="5.88">pushing their agenda with immigration</text>
  <text start="81.64" dur="5.82">and they&amp;#39;re trying to stir emotions</text>
  <text start="84.79" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re trying to push this as hard as</text>
  <text start="87.46" dur="6.03">they possibly can an attorney general</text>
  <text start="89.92" dur="6.33">Jeff session he is drafting a regulation</text>
  <text start="93.49" dur="4.98">that will narrow the asylum rules and</text>
  <text start="96.25" dur="4.89">likely deter many people from taking the</text>
  <text start="98.47" dur="5.22">costly and risky step of migrating</text>
  <text start="101.14" dur="5.22">towards United States now the draft of</text>
  <text start="103.69" dur="5.49">the regulation which could be enacted by</text>
  <text start="106.36" dur="4.89">the end of the year is as follows under</text>
  <text start="109.18" dur="3.87">the plan people will be barred from</text>
  <text start="111.25" dur="4.11">getting asylum if they came to the u.s.</text>
  <text start="113.05" dur="5.19">between ports of entry and were</text>
  <text start="115.36" dur="5.28">prosecuted for illegal entry it would</text>
  <text start="118.24" dur="3.93">also add presumptions that would make it</text>
  <text start="120.64" dur="4.07">extremely difficult for Central</text>
  <text start="122.17" dur="5.699">Americans to qualify for asylum and</text>
  <text start="124.71" dur="5.68">codify in even more restrictive form an</text>
  <text start="127.869" dur="4.321">opinion written by sessions in June that</text>
  <text start="130.39" dur="4.92">attempted to restrict asylum for victims</text>
  <text start="132.19" dur="5.97">of domestic and gang violence but as it</text>
  <text start="135.31" dur="6.54">exists now the proposal is sweeping and</text>
  <text start="138.16" dur="6.03">thorough revamp of asylum tightening the</text>
  <text start="141.85" dur="4.89">screws throughout the asylum process so</text>
  <text start="144.19" dur="6.15">the rewrite might help deter and prevent</text>
  <text start="146.74" dur="6.06">most migrants from exploiting the 1997</text>
  <text start="150.34" dur="4.35">Flores settlement and other catch and</text>
  <text start="152.8" dur="3.96">release loopholes which are now being</text>
  <text start="154.69" dur="4.35">used by huge numbers of Central American</text>
  <text start="156.76" dur="3.87">to move into the United States sessions</text>
  <text start="159.04" dur="5.22">new regulation will not change the</text>
  <text start="160.63" dur="6.24">federal Asylum law but would merely help</text>
  <text start="164.26" dur="5.4">with the agency&amp;#39;s interpretation of the</text>
  <text start="166.87" dur="4.199">law he has already used his authority to</text>
  <text start="169.66" dur="3.48">change many aspects of the asylum</text>
  <text start="171.069" dur="6.75">process as he tries to reduce the</text>
  <text start="173.14" dur="6.9">backlog of 600,000 asylum cases so it</text>
  <text start="177.819" dur="4.23">looks like he&amp;#39;s trying to do something</text>
  <text start="180.04" dur="4.14">to help the situation and of course</text>
  <text start="182.049" dur="4.231">Congress needs to do something and</text>
  <text start="184.18" dur="4.529">remember going back to Oba</text>
  <text start="186.28" dur="4.89">we know back then he created a</text>
  <text start="188.709" dur="4.651">memorandum allowing these illegals to</text>
  <text start="191.17" dur="3.96">come in of putting them on buses</text>
  <text start="193.36" dur="3.42">bringing them over to the sanctuary</text>
  <text start="195.13" dur="4.89">cities giving money to the sanctuary</text>
  <text start="196.78" dur="5.64">cities and most of these children were</text>
  <text start="200.02" dur="5.1">not children they were teenagers they</text>
  <text start="202.42" dur="5.55">were even older than that 19 20 years</text>
  <text start="205.12" dur="4.8">old and these individuals came up</text>
  <text start="207.97" dur="4.89">because he was down in Central America</text>
  <text start="209.92" dur="4.649">South America talking to all the leaders</text>
  <text start="212.86" dur="3.599">down there saying send the people up</text>
  <text start="214.569" dur="4.491">this way and there were many different</text>
  <text start="216.459" dur="5.341">agendas associated with this one</text>
  <text start="219.06" dur="5.679">obamacare - they were hoping to</text>
  <text start="221.8" dur="4.02">implement TPP which means all the</text>
  <text start="224.739" dur="3.361">countries were going to be on a level</text>
  <text start="225.82" dur="3.78">playing field on how much pay each</text>
  <text start="228.1" dur="3.48">person was going to receive and the</text>
  <text start="229.6" dur="4.02">American worker well they were gonna ask</text>
  <text start="231.58" dur="4.56">for too much so these individuals had to</text>
  <text start="233.62" dur="5.46">take their spot they also were used for</text>
  <text start="236.14" dur="5.879">voting to get these individuals to vote</text>
  <text start="239.08" dur="5.1">for a certain candidate and there were</text>
  <text start="242.019" dur="5.131">many other agendas associated with this</text>
  <text start="244.18" dur="5.1">and this another one was to blend all</text>
  <text start="247.15" dur="5.7">the countries into one just like they</text>
  <text start="249.28" dur="5.04">were trying to do in Europe right now so</text>
  <text start="252.85" dur="2.91">they were trying to do it here in the</text>
  <text start="254.32" dur="6.169">United States trying to do it in Europe</text>
  <text start="255.76" dur="7.5">and their whole agenda was to have a</text>
  <text start="260.489" dur="5.321">one-world government where everyone was</text>
  <text start="263.26" dur="4.89">the same no one had a separate identity</text>
  <text start="265.81" dur="5.19">and they were hoping that this would be</text>
  <text start="268.15" dur="5.16">a lot easier to control with their plans</text>
  <text start="271" dur="3.39">but their plans are backfiring and it</text>
  <text start="273.31" dur="3.69">doesn&amp;#39;t mean they haven&amp;#39;t given up</text>
  <text start="274.39" dur="5.6">because they keep pushing towards their</text>
  <text start="277" dur="6.27">goals and talking about refugees</text>
  <text start="279.99" dur="6.97">illegals blending everyone together</text>
  <text start="283.27" dur="6.87">Soros he is meeting with the new</text>
  <text start="286.96" dur="5.67">socialist president of Spain the prime</text>
  <text start="290.14" dur="4.35">minister of Spain and they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="292.63" dur="5.76">about open borders they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="294.49" dur="7.549">bringing more migrants up to the area of</text>
  <text start="298.39" dur="7.589">Spain and having them go throughout</text>
  <text start="302.039" dur="6.13">Europe and the new Prime Minister</text>
  <text start="305.979" dur="3.901">pledged to take down the barbed wire</text>
  <text start="308.169" dur="5.191">fences that protect Spain&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="309.88" dur="6.18">two new North African enclaves and we</text>
  <text start="313.36" dur="3.95">see that Soros he&amp;#39;s not giving up he</text>
  <text start="316.06" dur="3.38">knows he</text>
  <text start="317.31" dur="4.38">can&amp;#39;t get the refugees from the Middle</text>
  <text start="319.44" dur="4.41">East anymore he&amp;#39;s still trying but most</text>
  <text start="321.69" dur="6.12">of the refugees are returning back home</text>
  <text start="323.85" dur="6.63">especially in Syria and he realizes that</text>
  <text start="327.81" dur="5.34">he needs to get more refugees so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="330.48" dur="4.74">going to Africa right now and he wants</text>
  <text start="333.15" dur="4.44">the EU to flip the bill to have all</text>
  <text start="335.22" dur="4.73">these individuals move up into Europe</text>
  <text start="337.59" dur="5.22">and he&amp;#39;s not giving up on the goal</text>
  <text start="339.95" dur="4.63">because they think this whole thing</text>
  <text start="342.81" dur="4.77">right now is just a blip on their radar</text>
  <text start="344.58" dur="5.7">and once Trump is out of office and they</text>
  <text start="347.58" dur="3.93">have their person in power everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="350.28" dur="3.75">back on schedule</text>
  <text start="351.51" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;ll reintroduce TPP they&amp;#39;ll put</text>
  <text start="354.03" dur="5.16">everything back into place and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="356.76" dur="4.17">start the propaganda full force and</text>
  <text start="359.19" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;ll pretend it didn&amp;#39;t even happen</text>
  <text start="360.93" dur="5.49">and we&amp;#39;ll be back to where we were and</text>
  <text start="363.54" dur="5.28">this is their plan from the beginning</text>
  <text start="366.42" dur="5.64">because they&amp;#39;ve worked very hard and</text>
  <text start="368.82" dur="5.73">long for a very long time to get this</text>
  <text start="372.06" dur="5.01">plan where it is today and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="374.55" dur="3.81">just gonna sit by and wait for someone</text>
  <text start="377.07" dur="3.33">to destroy it</text>
  <text start="378.36" dur="3.99">so they&amp;#39;re gonna fight until the very</text>
  <text start="380.4" dur="3.99">end they&amp;#39;re gonna lie to the very end</text>
  <text start="382.35" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re gonna reject everything to the</text>
  <text start="384.39" dur="6.72">very end they&amp;#39;re never going to say we</text>
  <text start="387.72" dur="5.42">give they don&amp;#39;t do that and the only way</text>
  <text start="391.11" dur="5.64">to get rid of them is to arrest them or</text>
  <text start="393.14" dur="6.76">they commit suicide either one we see</text>
  <text start="396.75" dur="5.4">that the USS Truman is deployed to the</text>
  <text start="399.9" dur="3.48">Atlantic and of course the corporate</text>
  <text start="402.15" dur="3.87">media is going to turn this around</text>
  <text start="403.38" dur="5.28">because as we know this is about an</text>
  <text start="406.02" dur="4.35">ongoing rotation of US forces supporting</text>
  <text start="408.66" dur="3.63">maritime security operations in</text>
  <text start="410.37" dur="4.11">international waters but they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="412.29" dur="5.85">to say that the USS Harry as Truman is</text>
  <text start="414.48" dur="7.02">headed into this area to fight Russian</text>
  <text start="418.14" dur="6.45">aggression and remember the summit with</text>
  <text start="421.5" dur="5.67">Trump and Putin that is coming up and</text>
  <text start="424.59" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re going to try to push Russian</text>
  <text start="427.17" dur="5.16">aggression like we&amp;#39;ve never seen before</text>
  <text start="429.57" dur="5.25">as we approach the summit date we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="432.33" dur="5.73">gonna see a lot more of these stories in</text>
  <text start="434.82" dur="5.58">the corporate media we see Iran&amp;#39;s rohini</text>
  <text start="438.06" dur="6.72">he&amp;#39;s leaving for Switzerland and Austria</text>
  <text start="440.4" dur="6.93">to discuss the nuclear deal and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="444.78" dur="5.61">trying to get these countries together</text>
  <text start="447.33" dur="4.109">on this to try to support the nuclear</text>
  <text start="450.39" dur="2.879">deal and again</text>
  <text start="451.439" dur="4.05">if they&amp;#39;re not going to support this and</text>
  <text start="453.269" dur="5.46">pay Iran they&amp;#39;re going to be completely</text>
  <text start="455.489" dur="5.61">out it seems that we have news of the</text>
  <text start="458.729" dur="5.19">Obama administration who granted</text>
  <text start="461.099" dur="4.62">citizenship to 2500 Iranians including</text>
  <text start="463.919" dur="5.61">family members of government officials</text>
  <text start="465.719" dur="5.67">while negotiating the Iran nuclear deal</text>
  <text start="469.529" dur="5.34">and this is coming from a senior cleric</text>
  <text start="471.389" dur="5.64">and member of parliament in Iran and he</text>
  <text start="474.869" dur="4.59">claimed it was done as a favor to senior</text>
  <text start="477.029" dur="4.68">Iranian officials linked to Hassan</text>
  <text start="479.459" dur="4.92">rouhani and he alleged the move sparked</text>
  <text start="481.709" dur="4.83">a competition among Iranian officials</text>
  <text start="484.379" dur="4.8">over whose children would benefit from</text>
  <text start="486.539" dur="5.16">the scheme so we definitely see</text>
  <text start="489.179" dur="4.29">different information coming out about</text>
  <text start="491.699" dur="3.27">what has really happened with this</text>
  <text start="493.469" dur="3.45">Iranian deal and we know there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="494.969" dur="4.891">of funds that were being transferred</text>
  <text start="496.919" dur="6.33">over to Iran and then over into Syria to</text>
  <text start="499.86" dur="5.909">buy the uranium from Russia to create</text>
  <text start="503.249" dur="4.861">nuclear weapons and we see that this</text>
  <text start="505.769" dur="4.47">right now is falling apart on them and</text>
  <text start="508.11" dur="5.729">as more information comes out we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="510.239" dur="6.99">gonna see more of what we never even</text>
  <text start="513.839" dur="5.85">knew and it&amp;#39;s going to be shocking we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="517.229" dur="8.251">seeing that the Syrian government and</text>
  <text start="519.689" dur="7.921">the Kurdish YPG they are now talking</text>

  <text start="563.459" dur="3.781">is asking in return that the government</text>
  <text start="565.319" dur="5.19">makes the Kurdish language a part of the</text>
  <text start="567.24" dur="5.639">Syrian educational system count the</text>
  <text start="570.509" dur="4.921">period the YPG fighters served as</text>
  <text start="572.879" dur="5.161">service in the Syrian Armed Forces and</text>
  <text start="575.43" dur="5.639">give Kurdish official a permanency in</text>
  <text start="578.04" dur="5.64">the Syrian oil ministry now again</text>
  <text start="581.069" dur="3.851">they&amp;#39;re talking peace and it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="583.68" dur="4.209">look like the curve</text>
  <text start="584.92" dur="4.71">want a separate part of Sur anymore it</text>
  <text start="587.889" dur="4.32">looks like they want to have a</text>
  <text start="589.63" dur="6.3">relationship with the Syrian government</text>
  <text start="592.209" dur="6.69">and be one as a country so we can see</text>
  <text start="595.93" dur="4.89">that whole plan of separating Syria it</text>
  <text start="598.899" dur="2.88">doesn&amp;#39;t look like it&amp;#39;s happening we also</text>
  <text start="600.82" dur="3.42">see Bolton</text>
  <text start="601.779" dur="4.981">he has shifted his tone where he used to</text>
  <text start="604.24" dur="5.07">say Assad Moscow Assad must go now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="606.76" dur="5.55">saying Assad can stay Iran must leave</text>
  <text start="609.31" dur="4.529">Syria now of course Iran is out there</text>
  <text start="612.31" dur="4.11">and they are saying we only have</text>
  <text start="613.839" dur="6.391">advisors in Syria we don&amp;#39;t have armed</text>
  <text start="616.42" dur="6.719">forces but the u.s. Israel and many</text>
  <text start="620.23" dur="5.159">others are saying we need I ran out of</text>
  <text start="623.139" dur="4.411">Syria and I think what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="625.389" dur="5.341">do is they want I ran out of this area</text>
  <text start="627.55" dur="5.55">and if Iran does leave Israel has</text>
  <text start="630.73" dur="5.789">already stated they have no problem with</text>
  <text start="633.1" dur="7.71">Assad coming to the southern area also</text>
  <text start="636.519" dur="7.68">if Iran does leave Syria I believe the</text>
  <text start="640.81" dur="5.13">US would have no problem removing the</text>
  <text start="644.199" dur="3.57">troops from Syria I think this is a</text>
  <text start="645.94" dur="4.709">sticking point right now and I think</text>
  <text start="647.769" dur="5.101">Russia since Putin came out already and</text>
  <text start="650.649" dur="4.141">said listen all foreign forces and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="652.87" dur="4.469">including Iran in this should leave</text>
  <text start="654.79" dur="4.65">Syria Russia would stay I think this was</text>
  <text start="657.339" dur="4.231">the beginning stages of all this and I</text>
  <text start="659.44" dur="5.73">think the US the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="661.57" dur="5.879">has sent a signal to Putin where they</text>
  <text start="665.17" dur="6.659">halted all aid to Syrian rebels in the</text>
  <text start="667.449" dur="8.88">south this is a signal to Putin before</text>
  <text start="671.829" dur="6.741">the summit to say yes we want this to</text>
  <text start="676.329" dur="5.311">end we want the troops to come home and</text>

  <text start="1757.24" dur="3.93">corporate media right now they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1759.07" dur="4.92">to keep something else in the news cycle</text>
  <text start="1761.17" dur="4.92">make something else up to cover up that</text>

  <text start="1787.94" dur="3.93">try something else</text>
  <text start="1789.05" dur="4.95">once this report is Declassified and</text>
