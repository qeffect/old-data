  <text start="53.54" dur="5.28">hi and welcome you&amp;#39;re listening to the X</text>
  <text start="57.05" dur="5.22">when he to report my name is Dave and</text>
  <text start="58.82" dur="6.33">this is episode 1393 a and today&amp;#39;s date</text>
  <text start="62.27" dur="5.19">is October 4th 2017 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="65.15" dur="4.64">the episode is inflation warning</text>
  <text start="67.46" dur="4.65">inflation will hit like a tidal wave</text>
  <text start="69.79" dur="5.38">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="72.11" dur="5.16">financial news now ADP came out with</text>
  <text start="75.17" dur="4.11">their numbers and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="77.27" dur="5.07">employment now is growing at its slowest</text>
  <text start="79.28" dur="6.08">pace in 11 months and what we are seeing</text>
  <text start="82.34" dur="6">right now is basically employment is</text>
  <text start="85.36" dur="5.44">declining and we see that small</text>
  <text start="88.34" dur="5.4">businesses they are experiencing a dip</text>
  <text start="90.8" dur="6.959">in hiring we also see the service sector</text>
  <text start="93.74" dur="5.43">they are seeing a dip in hiring and when</text>
  <text start="97.759" dur="3.091">we look at this we can see that these</text>
  <text start="99.17" dur="4.26">small businesses they suffered the most</text>
  <text start="100.85" dur="5.01">with about 11,000 drop with service</text>
  <text start="103.43" dur="6.54">providing jobs even as goods producing</text>
  <text start="105.86" dur="6.39">rose and this is the most since 2009 and</text>
  <text start="109.97" dur="5.25">we need to remember something very</text>
  <text start="112.25" dur="6.06">important about all of this is these</text>
  <text start="115.22" dur="6.06">numbers they&amp;#39;ve been manipulated for a</text>
  <text start="118.31" dur="4.8">very long time since 2008 and when you</text>
  <text start="121.28" dur="4.29">look at the graph and you look at where</text>
  <text start="123.11" dur="4.53">employment has gone really it has gone</text>
  <text start="125.57" dur="4.199">nowhere it&amp;#39;s been up it&amp;#39;s been down it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="127.64" dur="3.81">been up it&amp;#39;s been down and we know that</text>
  <text start="129.769" dur="4.681">the number has been manipulated and</text>
  <text start="131.45" dur="6.33">massaged and no made it out the seen</text>
  <text start="134.45" dur="5.25">like employment is fantastic today but</text>
  <text start="137.78" dur="4.26">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="139.7" dur="6.84">everything is going to be catching up to</text>
  <text start="142.04" dur="7.49">where it was back in 2008-2009 because</text>
  <text start="146.54" dur="5.3">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is the real</text>
  <text start="149.53" dur="4.69">economy is going to shine through</text>
  <text start="151.84" dur="4.209">because you can only keep manipulation</text>
  <text start="154.22" dur="3.87">going for a certain period of time</text>
  <text start="156.049" dur="4.141">before everyone&amp;#39;s looking around saying</text>
  <text start="158.09" dur="3.899">ok why is that store at a business why</text>
  <text start="160.19" dur="3.06">is that store why is that company out of</text>
  <text start="161.989" dur="3.631">business where are all these people</text>
  <text start="163.25" dur="4.82">working and before you know it it really</text>
  <text start="165.62" dur="6.78">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense and there&amp;#39;s one way</text>
  <text start="168.07" dur="6.669">that we can tell that the employment</text>
  <text start="172.4" dur="4.92">numbers are completely made-up because</text>
  <text start="174.739" dur="4.831">when we look at these state tax receipts</text>
  <text start="177.32" dur="5.539">and we look at the federal tax receipts</text>
  <text start="179.57" dur="6.509">they have been declining</text>
  <text start="182.859" dur="4.21">during this period now think about this</text>
  <text start="186.079" dur="3.3">for a second if</text>
  <text start="187.069" dur="5.551">everyone has a job and everything is</text>
  <text start="189.379" dur="7.741">fantastic we wouldn&amp;#39;t see tax receipts</text>
  <text start="192.62" dur="8.16">declining we would see them increasing</text>
  <text start="197.12" dur="5.699">and what they&amp;#39;ve done is that everyone</text>
  <text start="200.78" dur="4.019">is now getting a part-time job which is</text>
  <text start="202.819" dur="4.471">lower pay and even though they count</text>
  <text start="204.799" dur="4.981">them as a full-time job that lower pay</text>
  <text start="207.29" dur="5.16">doesn&amp;#39;t produce the same amount of taxes</text>
  <text start="209.78" dur="4.47">this is why we see tax receipts falling</text>
  <text start="212.45" dur="3.48">we also see it falling because a lot of</text>
  <text start="214.25" dur="4.049">people don&amp;#39;t have jobs especially those</text>
  <text start="215.93" dur="6.509">people coming out of college they cannot</text>
  <text start="218.299" dur="6.631">find the high paying jobs now we know</text>
  <text start="222.439" dur="4.741">that the central banks they have been</text>
  <text start="224.93" dur="4.35">printing like crazy now let&amp;#39;s think</text>
  <text start="227.18" dur="6.389">about this for a second they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="229.28" dur="7.709">telling us that the economy is basically</text>
  <text start="233.569" dur="5.82">recovered employment we&amp;#39;re almost at</text>
  <text start="236.989" dur="4.801">full employment and they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="239.389" dur="4.651">that everything is fantastic the Fed</text>
  <text start="241.79" dur="4.5">seems no problems whatsoever</text>
  <text start="244.04" dur="5.279">it says the employment market is strong</text>
  <text start="246.29" dur="4.83">GDP numbers look pretty darn good they</text>
  <text start="249.319" dur="4.31">don&amp;#39;t see any type of problems now the</text>
  <text start="251.12" dur="5.489">question is if everything is fine</text>
  <text start="253.629" dur="5.61">why are interest rates still zero to</text>
  <text start="256.609" dur="5.13">negative why are they continually</text>
  <text start="259.239" dur="5.11">creating more and more currency propping</text>
  <text start="261.739" dur="4.981">up the entire system if everything is</text>
  <text start="264.349" dur="4.38">fine now though world&amp;#39;s central banks</text>
  <text start="266.72" dur="6.6">they have finally succeeded only in</text>
  <text start="268.729" dur="7.021">unleashing an inflationary storm now the</text>
  <text start="273.32" dur="4.5">first pickup has only just begun to be</text>
  <text start="275.75" dur="5.19">felt but this time next year when</text>
  <text start="277.82" dur="5.069">inflation is well north of 4% globally</text>
  <text start="280.94" dur="4.099">and the big price moves have already</text>
  <text start="282.889" dur="4.77">occurred everyone will be screaming</text>
  <text start="285.039" dur="4.511">inflation now remember you&amp;#39;re setting</text>
  <text start="287.659" dur="3.991">well 4% that&amp;#39;s just ridiculous or saying</text>
  <text start="289.55" dur="4.08">you know inflation now is 1.9 percent we</text>
  <text start="291.65" dur="4.5">other we had the other Fed houses come</text>
  <text start="293.63" dur="4.44">out and say well we calculated inflation</text>
  <text start="296.15" dur="3.329">and we&amp;#39;re getting three percent we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="298.07" dur="4.08">getting three point one percent weekend</text>
  <text start="299.479" dur="5.641">and 2.9 percent and we know that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="302.15" dur="5.699">taken inflation and they moved it into</text>
  <text start="305.12" dur="6.03">the student loan market which colleges</text>
  <text start="307.849" dur="5.581">they moved it into healthcare they moved</text>
  <text start="311.15" dur="4.56">it into the housing market they moved it</text>
  <text start="313.43" dur="4.349">into the stock market they shipped it</text>
  <text start="315.71" dur="4.75">overseas and eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="317.779" dur="3.73">happen it&amp;#39;s all gonna come flooding back</text>
  <text start="320.46" dur="4.17">United States is going to be like a</text>
  <text start="321.509" dur="5.391">tidal wave now the global central banks</text>
  <text start="324.63" dur="6.3">they are printing around a hundred</text>
  <text start="326.9" dur="4.69">twenty billion per month and this is</text>
  <text start="330.93" dur="3.06">happening</text>
  <text start="331.59" dur="6.12">at a time when most major economies are</text>
  <text start="333.99" dur="6.45">said to be doing perfectly well now put</text>
  <text start="337.71" dur="5.22">this in a completely different way the</text>
  <text start="340.44" dur="4.949">economies of the EU Japan and the US are</text>
  <text start="342.93" dur="3.54">growing rather than contracting but</text>
  <text start="345.389" dur="3.301">central banks are printing more money</text>
  <text start="346.47" dur="5.069">today than they were during the depths</text>
  <text start="348.69" dur="7.83">of the last systemic crisis and when we</text>
  <text start="351.539" dur="7.201">look at the percent of GDP the aggregate</text>
  <text start="356.52" dur="5.369">balance sheet of large central banks we</text>
  <text start="358.74" dur="6.87">can see that this has been going up and</text>
  <text start="361.889" dur="6.481">up and up and it has not stopped now the</text>
  <text start="365.61" dur="6.869">central banks they have been printing</text>
  <text start="368.37" dur="6.99">money at this pace for over two years</text>
  <text start="372.479" dur="5.521">now so we&amp;#39;re talking about 1.5 trillion</text>
  <text start="375.36" dur="5.79">in hot money hitting the financial</text>
  <text start="378" dur="5.039">system annually for two years now</text>
  <text start="381.15" dur="5.19">central banks have printed the rough</text>
  <text start="383.039" dur="5.341">equivalent of Germany&amp;#39;s economy and</text>
  <text start="386.34" dur="4.199">funneled this money into the financial</text>
  <text start="388.38" dur="5.219">system in the last two years and the</text>
  <text start="390.539" dur="4.081">markets they really haven&amp;#39;t taken notice</text>
  <text start="393.599" dur="3.421">at all</text>
  <text start="394.62" dur="4.799">already inflation expectations are</text>
  <text start="397.02" dur="4.889">roaring high and they haven&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="399.419" dur="5.55">broken out yet and we can see that</text>
  <text start="401.909" dur="5.221">everyone expects inflation to hit now</text>
  <text start="404.969" dur="5.19">when we look at what&amp;#39;s been going on we</text>
  <text start="407.13" dur="3.9">know that there has been inflation</text>
  <text start="410.159" dur="2.76">because we could see it in the</text>
  <text start="411.03" dur="4.05">supermarket you can see it with the food</text>
  <text start="412.919" dur="4.381">you could see it with things that you</text>
  <text start="415.08" dur="4.589">purchase you can see that the value of</text>
  <text start="417.3" dur="3.989">the dollar is decreasing and we have</text>
  <text start="419.669" dur="5.37">something huge going on right now</text>
  <text start="421.289" dur="6.151">because countries they are doing away</text>
  <text start="425.039" dur="5.25">with the dollar I mean it&amp;#39;s a very slow</text>
  <text start="427.44" dur="5.37">process nothing happens overnight now a</text>
  <text start="430.289" dur="5.011">lot of people say well you know why</text>
  <text start="432.81" dur="5.88">isn&amp;#39;t this happening yet this does not</text>
  <text start="435.3" dur="6.54">happen overnight because it would shake</text>
  <text start="438.69" dur="5.46">the entire global economy what they do</text>
  <text start="441.84" dur="3.48">is they do this very slowly and when</text>
  <text start="444.15" dur="2.699">they when the central banks and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="445.32" dur="3.42">talking about the central banks when</text>
  <text start="446.849" dur="5.1">they want to move to a different</text>
  <text start="448.74" dur="5.12">currency a new system they do it very</text>
  <text start="451.949" dur="4.041">quietly they</text>
  <text start="453.86" dur="3.99">do it very methodically and they make</text>
  <text start="455.99" dur="3.57">sure that no one is noticing and of</text>
  <text start="457.85" dur="3.03">course the corporate media is not going</text>
  <text start="459.56" dur="3.84">to report on this whatsoever</text>
  <text start="460.88" dur="4.56">now what they do is they make little</text>
  <text start="463.4" dur="4.71">moves a little move at a time let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="465.44" dur="3.57">let&amp;#39;s include the yuan with the SDR it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="468.11" dur="4.5">let&amp;#39;s make some announcements about</text>
  <text start="469.01" dur="6.06">crypto currency let&amp;#39;s duplicate the</text>
  <text start="472.61" dur="5.46">financial system in different countries</text>
  <text start="475.07" dur="6.03">that basically mimics what they have in</text>
  <text start="478.07" dur="5.79">the West all this has been done let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="481.1" dur="4.02">start backing the yuan with oil Mae</text>
  <text start="483.86" dur="3.95">let&amp;#39;s back it with gold</text>
  <text start="485.12" dur="7.29">let&amp;#39;s have other countries use the U one</text>
  <text start="487.81" dur="6.25">this is done through baby steps because</text>
  <text start="492.41" dur="4.38">what happens is over the many many years</text>
  <text start="494.06" dur="5.85">once they are finished everything is</text>
  <text start="496.79" dur="5.58">complete and nobody can say anything</text>
  <text start="499.91" dur="6.63">this is what we&amp;#39;ve been looking at all</text>
  <text start="502.37" dur="5.52">along I remember there was a time going</text>
  <text start="506.54" dur="3.72">way back and you can see this in the</text>
  <text start="507.89" dur="3.54">reports about China where there&amp;#39;ll you</text>
  <text start="510.26" dur="3.9">know they were gonna be joining the SDR</text>
  <text start="511.43" dur="3.96">and people are out there saying no this</text>
  <text start="514.16" dur="2.4">is gonna be impossible they&amp;#39;re never</text>
  <text start="515.39" dur="3.18">gonna be joining the SDR that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="516.56" dur="4.2">ridiculous and here we are today where</text>
  <text start="518.57" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re part of the SDR basket</text>
  <text start="520.76" dur="6.09">I remember when Russia was creating</text>
  <text start="524.48" dur="4.38">their own payment system because of the</text>
  <text start="526.85" dur="3.99">sanctions and China started to doing the</text>
  <text start="528.86" dur="4.59">same it is now complete</text>
  <text start="530.84" dur="6.45">now the payment system mimics the Swift</text>
  <text start="533.45" dur="6.27">payment system here in the West China</text>
  <text start="537.29" dur="4.83">opened up the Shanghai gold exchange</text>
  <text start="539.72" dur="5.91">they opened up the markets that are very</text>
  <text start="542.12" dur="6.42">similar to here out in the West this was</text>
  <text start="545.63" dur="5.64">all done over the many years and it was</text>
  <text start="548.54" dur="5.64">done on purpose nothing is by</text>
  <text start="551.27" dur="4.32">coincidence they know exactly when I say</text>
  <text start="554.18" dur="4.38">they I&amp;#39;m talking about the central</text>
  <text start="555.59" dur="5.04">banking system they know exactly what</text>
  <text start="558.56" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re doing and they know that</text>
  <text start="560.63" dur="4.64">inflation is going to hit which really</text>
  <text start="563" dur="4.68">means the devaluation of the dollar</text>
  <text start="565.27" dur="3.46">because as these countries move away</text>
  <text start="567.68" dur="2.91">from the dollar and they start using</text>
  <text start="568.73" dur="3.42">other currencies they don&amp;#39;t need to keep</text>
  <text start="570.59" dur="3.27">them in reserve the reason why they keep</text>
  <text start="572.15" dur="4.59">them reserves because they have to use</text>
  <text start="573.86" dur="5.07">them to purchase oil well if they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="576.74" dur="4.08">purchasing oil using the dollar there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="578.93" dur="5.61">no reason to keep them what else do you</text>
  <text start="580.82" dur="5.76">use them for so a lot of that might come</text>
  <text start="584.54" dur="3.03">back they might keep some of it but a</text>
  <text start="586.58" dur="2.76">lot of it it&amp;#39;s going to flow</text>
  <text start="587.57" dur="3.93">back to the United States they might not</text>
  <text start="589.34" dur="4.86">they might not even keep their Treasury</text>
  <text start="591.5" dur="4.71">bonds they might sell them off and once</text>
  <text start="594.2" dur="5.04">this starts to happen we&amp;#39;re gonna be in</text>
  <text start="596.21" dur="4.92">a bit of trouble here because inflation</text>
  <text start="599.24" dur="4.32">is going to hit and it&amp;#39;s going to hit</text>
  <text start="601.13" dur="4.08">hard and what the central banks have</text>
  <text start="603.56" dur="4.73">been trying to do throughout these years</text>
  <text start="605.21" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re trying to keep this away from</text>
  <text start="608.29" dur="5.68">the public telling us that everything is</text>
  <text start="611.6" dur="4.59">fine look there&amp;#39;s no inflation we have</text>
  <text start="613.97" dur="3.78">the interest rates at 0% a stock market</text>
  <text start="616.19" dur="5.49">keeps going up housing keeps going up</text>
  <text start="617.75" dur="6.63">and people believe when these things</text>
  <text start="621.68" dur="5.13">move up the economy is fine</text>
  <text start="624.38" dur="4.08">well they move back they moved up in</text>
  <text start="626.81" dur="3.69">2008 I mean the stock market hit</text>
  <text start="628.46" dur="4.59">all-time highs of like 14,000 plus</text>
  <text start="630.5" dur="5.79">points the housing market hit a height</text>
  <text start="633.05" dur="6.21">that we&amp;#39;ve never seen before and by the</text>
  <text start="636.29" dur="5.58">way that came crashing down and it was a</text>
  <text start="639.26" dur="5.19">complete disaster and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="641.87" dur="5.34">going to see this time we&amp;#39;re headed in</text>
  <text start="644.45" dur="5.4">that direction and we can see already</text>
  <text start="647.21" dur="5.25">that the central banks they are stuck</text>

  <text start="658.28" dur="4.32">need to create even more because what</text>
  <text start="660.68" dur="4.77">happens is the central banks are going</text>
  <text start="662.6" dur="4.38">to need to go into overdrive in creating</text>
  <text start="665.45" dur="3.69">currency this is why people are saying</text>

  <text start="699.47" dur="3.09">system when we&amp;#39;re coming off the gold</text>

  <text start="702.56" dur="5.55">was a huge amount of dollars in</text>
  <text start="705.47" dur="4.05">circulation and this is why they had to</text>
  <text start="708.11" dur="3.44">raise the interest rates at that point</text>
  <text start="709.52" dur="5.21">in time because the dollar was devalued</text>
