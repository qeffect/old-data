  <text start="82.3" dur="4.23">where they&amp;#39;re telling us that everything</text>
  <text start="84.22" dur="4.41">is fine we&amp;#39;re in a recovery we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="86.53" dur="4.41">hearing from the UK that everything</text>
  <text start="88.63" dur="5.37">looks good and we are getting</text>
  <text start="90.94" dur="6.57">information that everything is not as</text>
  <text start="94" dur="7.5">good as they say in Britain the economic</text>
  <text start="97.51" dur="6.3">recovery has slowed now 2.5% between the</text>
  <text start="101.5" dur="6.39">months of july in September and this was</text>
  <text start="103.81" dur="7.11">following a slump in construction the</text>
  <text start="107.89" dur="4.979">third quarter of 2015 is now down from</text>
  <text start="110.92" dur="3.93">point seven percent seen in the second</text>
  <text start="112.869" dur="4.891">quarter and this was lower than the</text>
  <text start="114.85" dur="6.05">economists expected their manufacturing</text>
  <text start="117.76" dur="6.78">shrank for a third quarter in a row</text>
  <text start="120.9" dur="6.039">construction is suffering its biggest</text>
  <text start="124.54" dur="5.79">contraction in three years and that is</text>
  <text start="126.939" dur="6.33">dropped around 2.2% and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="130.33" dur="6.51">seeing is individual European nations</text>
  <text start="133.269" dur="7.021">the UK Germany they are all they are all</text>
  <text start="136.84" dur="6.69">heading in the same direction as the</text>
  <text start="140.29" dur="8.729">United States and Canada and Australia</text>
  <text start="143.53" dur="7.98">and Switzerland because this system that</text>
  <text start="149.019" dur="3.901">they created which creates a lot more</text>
  <text start="151.51" dur="4.979">debt than there is money to pay that</text>
  <text start="152.92" dur="6.06">back cannot be sustained here in the</text>
  <text start="156.489" dur="4.65">United States what are we seeing we are</text>
  <text start="158.98" dur="4.92">seeing the economy completely falling</text>
  <text start="161.139" dur="4.8">apart everything is flashing red</text>
  <text start="163.9" dur="5.21">saying recession depression depression</text>
  <text start="165.939" dur="6.121">collapse we&amp;#39;re heading in this direction</text>
  <text start="169.11" dur="4.51">now the United States government uses</text>
  <text start="172.06" dur="3.989">the conference board to let everyone</text>
  <text start="173.62" dur="5.25">know how consumers feel what their</text>
  <text start="176.049" dur="6.3">confidence level is at and of course</text>
  <text start="178.87" dur="5.16">they brought the gas prices down to make</text>
  <text start="182.349" dur="3.36">everyone feel better that they have more</text>
  <text start="184.03" dur="4.349">money but it really hasn&amp;#39;t been working</text>
  <text start="185.709" dur="4.831">and remember the conference board that</text>
  <text start="188.379" dur="3.991">is a paid organization where they</text>
  <text start="190.54" dur="3.839">receive funds from the United States</text>
  <text start="192.37" dur="4.38">government now they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="194.379" dur="4.741">showing that everyone&amp;#39;s confidence is up</text>
  <text start="196.75" dur="6.87">it dipped a little bit but their graph</text>
  <text start="199.12" dur="6.449">is trending upward now on the opposite</text>
  <text start="203.62" dur="4.289">side we have Gallup which is a gallup</text>
  <text start="205.569" dur="6.62">poll which is taken by everyday people</text>
  <text start="207.909" dur="7.621">and their consumer confidence model is</text>
  <text start="212.189" dur="6.491">completely different than the conference</text>
  <text start="215.53" dur="6.59">board their model shows that everything</text>
  <text start="218.68" dur="6.05">is trending downward in a declining</text>
  <text start="222.12" dur="6.07">basically gallops economic confidence</text>
  <text start="224.73" dur="6.819">registered at negative 13 for the week</text>
  <text start="228.19" dur="6.449">ending October 25th which kind of</text>
  <text start="231.549" dur="5.761">matched last week&amp;#39;s and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="234.639" dur="7.591">that this has been in a downward trend</text>
  <text start="237.31" dur="6.81">since January which shows us that the</text>
  <text start="242.23" dur="5.31">actual people are saying you know</text>
  <text start="244.12" dur="6.449">something this economy is not getting</text>
  <text start="247.54" dur="5.339">better now of course the government</text>
  <text start="250.569" dur="5.16">likes to use their own organizations</text>
  <text start="252.879" dur="5.04">they fund them they manipulate the</text>
  <text start="255.729" dur="4.31">numbers they want to show what they want</text>
  <text start="257.919" dur="4.68">to show to show that we&amp;#39;re in a recovery</text>
  <text start="260.039" dur="6.671">but everything that we&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="262.599" dur="7.471">at real estate retail the real</text>
  <text start="266.71" dur="5.85">unemployment GDP inflation numbers and</text>
  <text start="270.07" dur="5.069">what&amp;#39;s really going on in this country</text>
  <text start="272.56" dur="6.75">and around the world we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="275.139" dur="8.161">see that this economy is sinking deeper</text>
  <text start="279.31" dur="8.539">and deeper into a depression now even</text>
  <text start="283.3" dur="7.2">rent the center which basically supplies</text>
  <text start="287.849" dur="5.68">electronics appliances to the lower</text>
  <text start="290.5" dur="4.289">middle class where a lot of times they</text>
  <text start="293.529" dur="4.2">don&amp;#39;t have the money they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="294.789" dur="6.56">funds to purchase these goods so they</text>
  <text start="297.729" dur="9.06">rent it and what they&amp;#39;re finding is that</text>
  <text start="301.349" dur="8.801">sales are way down the CFO of rent a</text>
  <text start="306.789" dur="4.981">center said the company is challenged by</text>
  <text start="310.15" dur="4.409">the sales of computer which are down</text>
  <text start="311.77" dur="6.269">double digits and we&amp;#39;re also seeing</text>
  <text start="314.559" dur="6">problems with appliances furniture and</text>
  <text start="318.039" dur="6.84">everything else and they&amp;#39;re saying the</text>
  <text start="320.559" dur="6.6">economy is to blame for this the US</text>
  <text start="324.879" dur="4.891">consumer is struggling and the last</text>
  <text start="327.159" dur="6.84">thing that any of us needs is another</text>
  <text start="329.77" dur="6.479">payment so basically people do not have</text>
  <text start="333.999" dur="3.63">the discretionary funds to go out and</text>
  <text start="336.249" dur="4.081">say you know something let me get that</text>
  <text start="337.629" dur="3.96">big TV let let me get that new couch</text>
  <text start="340.33" dur="3.899">they&amp;#39;re saying you know something I can</text>
  <text start="341.589" dur="4.591">make do with this couch I can make do</text>
  <text start="344.229" dur="3.481">with the TV that I have and I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="346.18" dur="5.009">to buy it I don&amp;#39;t want to rent it and</text>
  <text start="347.71" dur="6.09">we&amp;#39;re seeing this out in the retail</text>
  <text start="351.189" dur="3.87">world where people are not going out and</text>
  <text start="353.8" dur="3.78">purchasing this is why we see a</text>
  <text start="355.059" dur="5.491">contraction of retail right now this is</text>
  <text start="357.58" dur="6.449">why we see stores closing at this point</text>
  <text start="360.55" dur="4.5">and we understand those youths that are</text>
  <text start="364.029" dur="3.301">coming out of college that are</text>
  <text start="365.05" dur="5.31">graduating they can&amp;#39;t find jobs either</text>
  <text start="367.33" dur="4.589">and they&amp;#39;re not helping the economy</text>
  <text start="370.36" dur="2.849">whatsoever because they&amp;#39;re still living</text>
  <text start="371.919" dur="3.72">with their parents they have these</text>
  <text start="373.209" dur="5.49">part-time jobs and they can barely pay</text>
  <text start="375.639" dur="4.77">back their student loans but the wealthy</text>
  <text start="378.699" dur="5.31">understand what&amp;#39;s going on the elite</text>
  <text start="380.409" dur="6.87">understand and they always seem to get</text>
  <text start="384.009" dur="7.611">out right before everything collapses</text>
  <text start="387.279" dur="9.51">for example Sam Zell he is dumping</text>
  <text start="391.62" dur="7.18">23,000 apartments because he realizes we</text>
  <text start="396.789" dur="7.97">are at the top of the real estate market</text>
  <text start="398.8" dur="5.959">and it is time to get out right now and</text>
  <text start="404.939" dur="9.88">he called the real estate market back in</text>
  <text start="409.05" dur="7.81">2007 and he is getting out right now</text>
  <text start="414.819" dur="6.72">because he understands the real estate</text>
  <text start="416.86" dur="8.669">market is coming down and back in two</text>
  <text start="421.539" dur="6.99">thousand seven he sold his company</text>
  <text start="425.529" dur="6.121">equity equity office properties to</text>
  <text start="428.529" dur="5.491">Blackstone for 23 billion soon after he</text>
  <text start="431.65" dur="5.34">this the commercial property market</text>
  <text start="434.02" dur="7.619">crashed as prices fell and debt defaults</text>
  <text start="436.99" dur="8.12">surged so right now he&amp;#39;s unloading 5.4</text>
  <text start="441.639" dur="7.111">billion dollars worth of real estate</text>
  <text start="445.11" dur="7.179">because he&amp;#39;s saying we&amp;#39;ve hit the top we</text>
  <text start="448.75" dur="6.389">are heading down and the wealthy elite</text>
  <text start="452.289" dur="5.491">they always get out on top not just with</text>
  <text start="455.139" dur="3.87">real estate with stocks or any other</text>
  <text start="457.78" dur="4.169">type of investment because they</text>
  <text start="459.009" dur="5.791">understand they have an inside track of</text>
  <text start="461.949" dur="4.59">what is going on here and I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="464.8" dur="4.619">tracking real estate right now and let</text>
  <text start="466.539" dur="4.531">me tell you prices are coming down in</text>
  <text start="469.419" dur="3.06">many many of the areas yes there are</text>
  <text start="471.07" dur="3.54">certain areas where they&amp;#39;re staying</text>
  <text start="472.479" dur="4.141">level and other areas they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="474.61" dur="4.52">climbing a little bit but for the most</text>
  <text start="476.62" dur="6.24">part everything starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="479.13" dur="5.98">we&amp;#39;re starting to see services PMI they</text>
  <text start="482.86" dur="5.369">are continually still coming down they</text>
  <text start="485.11" dur="6.899">have plunged 54.4 this is the lowest in</text>
  <text start="488.229" dur="5.91">nine months this flash data shows the</text>
  <text start="492.009" dur="7.851">weakest payroll numbers since februari</text>
  <text start="494.139" dur="10.471">and business confidence remains very low</text>
  <text start="499.86" dur="6.48">we are now seeing durable goods they</text>
  <text start="504.61" dur="4.799">have tumbled and durable goods or</text>
  <text start="506.34" dur="5.949">appliances where people usually just buy</text>
  <text start="509.409" dur="7.141">them as a one-off type of thing a washer</text>
  <text start="512.289" dur="7.8">a dryer dishwasher electronics TVs cars</text>
  <text start="516.55" dur="7.28">and September durable goods new orders</text>
  <text start="520.089" dur="9">dropped what by one-point-two percent</text>
  <text start="523.83" dur="8.5">the fifth monthly drop this year what</text>
  <text start="529.089" dur="5.971">does this tell us the people are tapped</text>
  <text start="532.33" dur="7.86">out they don&amp;#39;t have the money to buy</text>
  <text start="535.06" dur="8.45">this type of product they&amp;#39;re not doing</text>
  <text start="540.19" dur="5.43">it and if they&amp;#39;re not buying the product</text>
  <text start="543.51" dur="5.519">manufacturers do not have to produce</text>
  <text start="545.62" dur="6.21">this is why we see manufacturing down if</text>
  <text start="549.029" dur="4.721">they don&amp;#39;t if the manufacturers are not</text>
  <text start="551.83" dur="4.56">producing they don&amp;#39;t need the raw</text>
  <text start="553.75" dur="4.32">material this is why we see the Baltic</text>
  <text start="556.39" dur="7.069">Dry Index down to seven hundred and</text>
  <text start="558.07" dur="7.35">thirty nine points the entire global</text>
  <text start="563.459" dur="4.841">industrial manufacturing</text>
  <text start="565.42" dur="7.08">is falling apart right in front of our</text>
  <text start="568.3" dur="6.54">eyes it&amp;#39;s telling us that this whole</text>
  <text start="572.5" dur="5.7">entire system is collapsing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="574.84" dur="5.97">heading into a holiday season this is</text>
  <text start="578.2" dur="4.53">supposed to be the time of year where</text>
  <text start="580.81" dur="5.07">people go out and purchase this type of</text>
  <text start="582.73" dur="5.64">goods where manufacturers produce where</text>
  <text start="585.88" dur="6.66">they order the raw material we are</text>
  <text start="588.37" dur="8.12">seeing the opposite right now this tells</text>
  <text start="592.54" dur="9.09">us that we are headed into a time frame</text>
  <text start="596.49" dur="9.73">where this entire economy is going to</text>
  <text start="601.63" dur="8.46">accelerate downward and nothing the Fed</text>
  <text start="606.22" dur="5.43">or the US government they will not be</text>
  <text start="610.09" dur="4.62">able to there&amp;#39;s nothing that they can do</text>
  <text start="611.65" dur="5.91">about this whatsoever yes they can</text>
  <text start="614.71" dur="5.22">manipulate numbers they can say okay</text>
  <text start="617.56" dur="6.66">zero percent interest rates but the</text>
  <text start="619.93" dur="7.26">economy will continue its downward trend</text>
  <text start="624.22" dur="6.65">yes they might slow it but it will not</text>
  <text start="627.19" dur="9.24">improve this we&amp;#39;ve had proof of this</text>
  <text start="630.87" dur="7.87">they&amp;#39;ve created QE 1 2 3 4 they board up</text>
  <text start="636.43" dur="4.98">the toxic real estate on the banks</text>
  <text start="638.74" dur="5.25">balance sheets and what have we seen</text>
  <text start="641.41" dur="7.5">since that time a little bump up and</text>
  <text start="643.99" dur="7.71">then a downward trend and now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="648.91" dur="4.56">getting worse than we&amp;#39;ve ever seen it</text>
  <text start="651.7" dur="6.15">before actually we&amp;#39;re back to the time</text>
  <text start="653.47" dur="7.59">of where we were back in 2009 this is</text>
  <text start="657.85" dur="5.7">where we stand right now and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="661.06" dur="6.15">going to get worse this is the calm</text>
  <text start="663.55" dur="6.09">before the economic storm where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="667.21" dur="4.89">telling us everything is fine we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="669.64" dur="4.68">this drop in the stock market they</text>

  <text start="677.01" dur="8.65">we&amp;#39;ve seen this multiple times before in</text>
  <text start="680.55" dur="8.86">2008 2001 1929 where everyone believed</text>
  <text start="685.66" dur="5.43">that everything was okay because the</text>
  <text start="689.41" dur="4.95">government said see we fixed it once</text>
  <text start="691.09" dur="6.21">again everything is fine they explained</text>

  <text start="812.47" dur="5.88">not stop</text>
  <text start="814.51" dur="7.55">we see Iran right now they have</text>
  <text start="818.35" dur="8.07">purchased a stake in the china-led aiib</text>
  <text start="822.06" dur="8.83">so here we are with 50 countries already</text>
  <text start="826.42" dur="8.43">who have bought into the aiib to rival</text>
  <text start="830.89" dur="6.93">the IMF and we can see which way Iran is</text>
  <text start="834.85" dur="5.73">leaning it is leaning away from the</text>
  <text start="837.82" dur="6.18">United States because they realize</text>
  <text start="840.58" dur="6.66">eventually the dollar is collapsing they</text>
  <text start="844" dur="4.62">know this they&amp;#39;re going to they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="847.24" dur="5.4">to look towards China they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="848.62" dur="9.2">look towards Russia and away from the</text>
  <text start="852.64" dur="7.89">United States Obamacare was developed to</text>
  <text start="857.82" dur="4.72">bring in revenue to the government and</text>
  <text start="860.53" dur="4.68">to of course make the insurance</text>
  <text start="862.54" dur="4.77">companies very very wealthy and of</text>
  <text start="865.21" dur="3.57">course they use the cover story that</text>
  <text start="867.31" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re providing a benefit to the</text>
  <text start="868.78" dur="4.29">American people and of course you know</text>
  <text start="871.12" dur="5.04">this is not a benefit because if it was</text>
  <text start="873.07" dur="5.07">so good our government employees would</text>
  <text start="876.16" dur="5.46">have taken it they would have dropped</text>
  <text start="878.14" dur="5.91">their government insurance plans and</text>
  <text start="881.62" dur="5.01">they would have hopped on Obamacare but</text>
  <text start="884.05" dur="5.61">they didn&amp;#39;t because they knew that this</text>
  <text start="886.63" dur="6.59">was junk basically that&amp;#39;s what it is and</text>
  <text start="889.66" dur="7.2">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="893.22" dur="8.08">people who are earning a living working</text>
  <text start="896.86" dur="7.65">for companies can&amp;#39;t afford the insurance</text>
  <text start="901.3" dur="5.52">and I&amp;#39;m talking about those people who</text>
  <text start="904.51" dur="4.41">are working for twelve dollars fifteen</text>
  <text start="906.82" dur="5.61">dollars an hour or working as a waiter</text>
  <text start="908.92" dur="6.3">or waitress relying on tips and of</text>
  <text start="912.43" dur="5.34">course the employer mandate said if you</text>
  <text start="915.22" dur="4.83">have 50 employees or more you need the</text>
  <text start="917.77" dur="3.42">two you need to supply your employees</text>
  <text start="920.05" dur="4.58">with insurance but of course the</text>
  <text start="921.19" dur="7.2">employees are paying for this and we see</text>
  <text start="924.63" dur="7">in a lot of these businesses employees</text>
  <text start="928.39" dur="7.08">they just don&amp;#39;t have the funds to pay</text>
  <text start="931.63" dur="6.15">for this for for instance if you are an</text>
  <text start="935.47" dur="5.85">employee and you&amp;#39;re making fifteen</text>
  <text start="937.78" dur="6.05">dollars an hour you would have to pay a</text>
  <text start="941.32" dur="4.59">hundred and thirty dollars a month and</text>
  <text start="943.83" dur="3.22">if you&amp;#39;re making fifteen dollars an hour</text>
  <text start="945.91" dur="2.13">that&amp;#39;s quite a bit but you have to</text>
  <text start="947.05" dur="4.5">remember the</text>
  <text start="948.04" dur="6.599">insurance has a deductible of 2,500 so</text>
  <text start="951.55" dur="7.56">you get no benefit whatsoever until you</text>
  <text start="954.639" dur="5.581">reach the deductible of 2,500 so that is</text>
  <text start="959.11" dur="3.719">a lot of money and that is for one</text>
  <text start="960.22" dur="6.929">person if you have a family of two or</text>
  <text start="962.829" dur="6.271">three or four guess what you can&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="967.149" dur="4.62">and a lot of these people are saying</text>
  <text start="969.1" dur="5.13">listen I&amp;#39;m not taking this insurance I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="971.769" dur="7.081">skipping it right now because it is way</text>
  <text start="974.23" dur="8.159">too expensive and i get no benefit if i</text>
  <text start="978.85" dur="7.71">have to decide between food or insurance</text>
  <text start="982.389" dur="6.241">I&amp;#39;m choosing food and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot</text>
  <text start="986.56" dur="4.469">of this and of course then these people</text>
  <text start="988.63" dur="4.11">will get hit with penalties so where is</text>
  <text start="991.029" dur="4.8">the benefit to the people at this point</text>
  <text start="992.74" dur="5.969">it isn&amp;#39;t there the benefit is to the</text>
  <text start="995.829" dur="4.26">corporations because now they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="998.709" dur="5.701">supplying these people with health</text>
  <text start="1000.089" dur="6.961">benefits so as time goes on this is just</text>
  <text start="1004.41" dur="4.89">going to get worse and worse and people</text>
  <text start="1007.05" dur="4.5">are going to have less and less money to</text>
  <text start="1009.3" dur="4.83">spend in the economy which will then</text>
  <text start="1011.55" dur="6.26">push the economy over the cliff which</text>
  <text start="1014.13" dur="8.04">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now because remember</text>
  <text start="1017.81" dur="7.57">seventy percent of GDP is made up of</text>
  <text start="1022.17" dur="6.029">consumer spending people are not</text>
  <text start="1025.38" dur="4.74">spending listen everyone thanks a lot</text>
  <text start="1028.199" dur="6.201">for listening be well be safe and</text>
  <text start="1030.12" dur="4.28">especially be prepared thanks a lot</text>
