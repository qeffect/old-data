  <text start="49.59" dur="5.61">hi and welcome you listening to the x-22</text>
  <text start="53.28" dur="4.86">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="55.2" dur="5.789">episode 1213 B and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="58.14" dur="5.34">February 24th 2017 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="60.989" dur="4.761">the episode is the battle heats up the</text>
  <text start="63.48" dur="5.07">deep state is ready to go all the way</text>
  <text start="65.75" dur="6.28">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="68.55" dur="5.58">political and geopolitical news now the</text>
  <text start="72.03" dur="6.03">corporate media is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="74.13" dur="8.01">pushing these poll numbers that people</text>
  <text start="78.06" dur="6.99">want Obamacare they love Obamacare and</text>
  <text start="82.14" dur="4.589">MSM is out there and they&amp;#39;re all out</text>
  <text start="85.05" dur="3.06">there saying that these are the new poll</text>
  <text start="86.729" dur="4.801">numbers and this is why it can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="88.11" dur="7.08">repealed and the polls coming from Pew</text>
  <text start="91.53" dur="6.479">Research Center and it concludes that</text>
  <text start="95.19" dur="6.33">support for Obamacare has surged to new</text>
  <text start="98.009" dur="6.211">record highs in recent months well this</text>
  <text start="101.52" dur="4.83">is kind of strange because other polls</text>
  <text start="104.22" dur="5.039">show something completely different and</text>
  <text start="106.35" dur="6.18">then we look closely at the poll rizzo</text>
  <text start="109.259" dur="8.071">results and what do we say well they</text>
  <text start="112.53" dur="9.06">over sampled again they surveyed</text>
  <text start="117.33" dur="9.39">Republicans about 581 and then they</text>
  <text start="121.59" dur="7.529">serve it surveyed Democrats about 797 so</text>
  <text start="126.72" dur="5.7">they waited it a little bit towards the</text>
  <text start="129.119" dur="6.181">Democrats and this is how they got their</text>
  <text start="132.42" dur="6.6">poll results and we can see at this</text>
  <text start="135.3" dur="7.22">point from Project Veritas what CNN will</text>
  <text start="139.02" dur="5.579">CNN also doctored their poll results and</text>
  <text start="142.52" dur="5.079">we see they&amp;#39;ve been doing this quite</text>
  <text start="144.599" dur="7.711">often but they don&amp;#39;t tell you this they</text>
  <text start="147.599" dur="7.381">just give you the information and what</text>
  <text start="152.31" dur="5.039">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is there there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="154.98" dur="5.04">a battle going on between the</text>
  <text start="157.349" dur="4.561">administration and the deep state and</text>
  <text start="160.02" dur="4.23">the corporate media is part of the deep</text>
  <text start="161.91" dur="4.56">state which we all knew for a very long</text>
  <text start="164.25" dur="6.81">time what we&amp;#39;re seeing at this point is</text>
  <text start="166.47" dur="7.47">that they&amp;#39;re both are battling on who is</text>
  <text start="171.06" dur="4.679">going to be the winner of information</text>
  <text start="173.94" dur="4.43">and we can see that the deep state right</text>
  <text start="175.739" dur="6.81">now is going all out</text>
  <text start="178.37" dur="4.99">censoring D monetizing getting rid of</text>
  <text start="182.549" dur="2.881">revenue</text>
  <text start="183.36" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re pulling all the tricks what&amp;#39;s up</text>
  <text start="185.43" dur="5.22">what they come you know anything they</text>
  <text start="187.08" dur="6.329">can possibly do to make sure that people</text>
  <text start="190.65" dur="7.08">don&amp;#39;t see any other information they</text>
  <text start="193.409" dur="8.101">don&amp;#39;t want people to see anything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="197.73" dur="6.69">how they created the corporate media by</text>
  <text start="201.51" dur="6.119">omitting well if you don&amp;#39;t see it we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="204.42" dur="6.95">not lying and if you don&amp;#39;t see it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="207.629" dur="5.911">just not happening well that&amp;#39;s not true</text>
  <text start="211.37" dur="4.72">and everyone who listens to the</text>
  <text start="213.54" dur="4.19">alternative media you need to support</text>
  <text start="216.09" dur="4.679">the alternative media and that only by</text>
  <text start="217.73" dur="6.61">paying you know donations and giving</text>
  <text start="220.769" dur="7.08">money we need to all stick together and</text>
  <text start="224.34" dur="5.94">tell the truth give the facts because</text>
  <text start="227.849" dur="3.841">the truth can just stand on its own you</text>
  <text start="230.28" dur="2.97">don&amp;#39;t have to back it up you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="231.69" dur="4.889">to do anything as long as the truth and</text>
  <text start="233.25" dur="5.069">you have facts because they can spew all</text>
  <text start="236.579" dur="4.621">the lies but the truth and the facts</text>
  <text start="238.319" dur="6.45">will just stand out and you can&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="241.2" dur="5.67">hit it down and people who are listening</text>
  <text start="244.769" dur="5.611">people who like the alternative media</text>
  <text start="246.87" dur="5.85">like what they&amp;#39;re hearing well if you</text>
  <text start="250.38" dur="5.31">see comments on either YouTube or on</text>
  <text start="252.72" dur="5.91">websites and you hear people speaking</text>
  <text start="255.69" dur="4.47">about you know the corporate media you</text>
  <text start="258.63" dur="4.59">need to back what you&amp;#39;re going to say to</text>
  <text start="260.16" dur="7.41">them with facts and show that no you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="263.22" dur="8.879">wrong here is a fact and that will push</text>
  <text start="267.57" dur="7.469">the corporate media back the trolls back</text>
  <text start="272.099" dur="4.891">because they can&amp;#39;t respond to facts they</text>
  <text start="275.039" dur="3.481">have a problem with it if you notice</text>
  <text start="276.99" dur="5.76">most of the time they&amp;#39;re very emotional</text>
  <text start="278.52" dur="6.57">and what happens is the corporate media</text>
  <text start="282.75" dur="4.889">they don&amp;#39;t like leaving their comment</text>
  <text start="285.09" dur="3.9">section open they usually close it</text>
  <text start="287.639" dur="4.171">because they don&amp;#39;t want people talking</text>
  <text start="288.99" dur="5.34">about it the alternative media they</text>
  <text start="291.81" dur="6.539">leave the comment section wide open say</text>
  <text start="294.33" dur="5.459">whatever you want trolls you know people</text>
  <text start="298.349" dur="4.891">who want to speak it doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="299.789" dur="6.121">because you have the freedom to talk and</text>
  <text start="303.24" dur="6.09">speak but what we see happening right</text>
  <text start="305.91" dur="6.6">now within the White House within the</text>
  <text start="309.33" dur="6.18">corporate media we see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="312.51" dur="4.2">butting heads we have leakers inside the</text>
  <text start="315.51" dur="2.88">White House leaking</text>
  <text start="316.71" dur="3.66">things to the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="318.39" dur="3.24">corporate media is running with it most</text>
  <text start="320.37" dur="2.97">of the time it&amp;#39;s completely wrong</text>
  <text start="321.63" dur="2.91">they&amp;#39;re taking drafts and things that</text>
  <text start="323.34" dur="3">aren&amp;#39;t even happening</text>
  <text start="324.54" dur="5.27">they&amp;#39;re not even signed so it&amp;#39;s not even</text>
  <text start="326.34" dur="5.97">real news but they&amp;#39;re going with it and</text>
  <text start="329.81" dur="7.12">we can see that Trump was out there and</text>
  <text start="332.31" dur="7.5">he was saying that he wants the FBI to</text>
  <text start="336.93" dur="6.3">stop the national security leakers now</text>
  <text start="339.81" dur="5.73">the FBI says they they just don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="343.23" dur="5.19">the ability to do it they can&amp;#39;t find out</text>
  <text start="345.54" dur="4.98">who the leakers are they can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="348.42" dur="3.75">anything which is kind of strange</text>
  <text start="350.52" dur="3.12">because I don&amp;#39;t know when we have a</text>
  <text start="352.17" dur="5.37">cyber attack from North Korea they know</text>
  <text start="353.64" dur="7.19">the next day when we have 9/11 they knew</text>
  <text start="357.54" dur="7.53">exactly who did it like that day when</text>
  <text start="360.83" dur="7.06">there&amp;#39;s a false flag they know exactly</text>
  <text start="365.07" dur="4.35">who the people are but they can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="367.89" dur="3.72">the leakers that&amp;#39;s how you know the</text>
  <text start="369.42" dur="4.62">other stuff is fake that means they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="371.61" dur="5.1">have to do an investigation now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="374.04" dur="5.13">either the FBI is in on everything which</text>
  <text start="376.71" dur="4.17">is most likely true and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="379.17" dur="4.56">to find the leakers because they&amp;#39;re part</text>
  <text start="380.88" dur="4.22">of the deep state system and I know</text>
  <text start="383.73" dur="3.78">there&amp;#39;s good guys and they&amp;#39;re bad guys</text>
  <text start="385.1" dur="4.45">within this within the framework and</text>
  <text start="387.51" dur="4.35">there&amp;#39;s a battle going on between both</text>
  <text start="389.55" dur="5.52">of them and the deep state right now is</text>
  <text start="391.86" dur="6.15">going all out on their plans they need</text>
  <text start="395.07" dur="5.13">to shut down the administration now we</text>
  <text start="398.01" dur="4.11">can see at this point that things are</text>
  <text start="400.2" dur="4.94">getting really heated right now</text>
  <text start="402.12" dur="5.73">and we can see that Democrats</text>
  <text start="405.14" dur="5.44">Republicans it&amp;#39;s all part of the same</text>
  <text start="407.85" dur="6.99">exact system we see out in Arizona right</text>
  <text start="410.58" dur="7.41">now the Republicans in Arizona Senate if</text>
  <text start="414.84" dur="4.77">they get their way police in that state</text>
  <text start="417.99" dur="4.73">could soon have the power to seize</text>
  <text start="419.61" dur="5.13">assets and property from protesters and</text>
  <text start="422.72" dur="5.47">this is coming out of the Arizona</text>
  <text start="424.74" dur="5.25">Capitol times what they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="428.19" dur="4.86">that they&amp;#39;re claiming people are being</text>
  <text start="429.99" dur="6.39">paid to write well we know this for a</text>
  <text start="433.05" dur="5.91">fact because we&amp;#39;ve reported on this and</text>
  <text start="436.38" dur="4.74">we&amp;#39;ve seen this Republican state</text>
  <text start="438.96" dur="4.59">senators voted Wednesday to give police</text>
  <text start="441.12" dur="4.02">new power to arrest anyone who is</text>
  <text start="443.55" dur="5.91">involved in a peaceful demonstration</text>
  <text start="445.14" dur="4.92">that may turn bad even before anything</text>
  <text start="449.46" dur="6.75">actually</text>
  <text start="450.06" dur="10.32">happens well first of all we have the</text>
  <text start="456.21" dur="7.59">First Amendment freedom of speech you</text>
  <text start="460.38" dur="6.42">can protest peacefully and the</text>
  <text start="463.8" dur="9.14">government cannot touch you so right off</text>
  <text start="466.8" dur="9.21">the bat unconstitutional SB 1 142</text>
  <text start="472.94" dur="5.56">expands the state racketeering law now</text>
  <text start="476.01" dur="5.4">aimed at organized crime to also include</text>
  <text start="478.5" dur="5.13">rioting and it redefines what</text>
  <text start="481.41" dur="4.65">constitutes rioting to include actions</text>
  <text start="483.63" dur="5.19">that result in damage the property of</text>
  <text start="486.06" dur="5.55">others but the real heart of the</text>
  <text start="488.82" dur="4.89">legislation is what Democrats say is the</text>
  <text start="491.61" dur="3.39">guilt by association and giving the</text>
  <text start="493.71" dur="3.45">government the right to criminally</text>
  <text start="495" dur="4.47">prosecute and seize the assets of</text>
  <text start="497.16" dur="6.38">everyone who planned a protest and</text>
  <text start="499.47" dur="6.9">everyone who participated by including</text>
  <text start="503.54" dur="5.62">rioting in racketeering laws it is</text>
  <text start="506.37" dur="6.06">actually permitted police to arrest</text>
  <text start="509.16" dur="5.16">those who are planning events planning</text>
  <text start="512.43" dur="3.539">events meaning cops will have the</text>
  <text start="514.32" dur="3.659">authority to investigate activists</text>
  <text start="515.969" dur="6.51">before the demonstrations even take</text>
  <text start="517.979" dur="7.761">place which again is a violation of the</text>
  <text start="522.479" dur="5.791">first the fourth all the amendments</text>
  <text start="525.74" dur="5.62">because you&amp;#39;re allowed to protest</text>
  <text start="528.27" dur="5.91">peacefully now if there are riots that</text>
  <text start="531.36" dur="5.16">break out and they destroy property well</text>
  <text start="534.18" dur="4.5">these people can be arrested and they</text>
  <text start="536.52" dur="6.27">should you know they should have to pay</text>
  <text start="538.68" dur="6.93">for what they did but what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="542.79" dur="5.82">trying to do is absolutely ridiculous at</text>
  <text start="545.61" dur="5.58">this point but we can see that both</text>
  <text start="548.61" dur="8.04">sides are coming up with a lot of crazy</text>
  <text start="551.19" dur="8.21">things and pushing very hard to get</text>
  <text start="556.65" dur="5.55">their agenda and we have to remember</text>
  <text start="559.4" dur="6.85">Republican Democrats it&amp;#39;s all part of</text>
  <text start="562.2" dur="7.02">the same system because they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="566.25" dur="5.339">pretty much paid off by corporations by</text>
  <text start="569.22" dur="4.89">central bank&amp;#39;s by special interest</text>
  <text start="571.589" dur="4.291">groups and that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;ve been saying</text>
  <text start="574.11" dur="4.59">for a very long time we need to</text>
  <text start="575.88" dur="5.43">completely clean out pretty much almost</text>
  <text start="578.7" dur="4.389">everyone inside of government yes there</text>
  <text start="581.31" dur="4.259">are a few people that are</text>
  <text start="583.089" dur="5.04">good but there&amp;#39;s a lot in there that</text>
  <text start="585.569" dur="3.851">aren&amp;#39;t and it looks like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="588.129" dur="4.08">approaching that time where we really</text>
  <text start="589.42" dur="5.279">need to clean out what is in there</text>
  <text start="592.209" dur="6.18">because they are not working for the</text>
  <text start="594.699" dur="6.781">people we need a government we need</text>
  <text start="598.389" dur="6.63">representation to work for the people</text>
  <text start="601.48" dur="5.099">only you don&amp;#39;t need all these laws you</text>
  <text start="605.019" dur="3.87">don&amp;#39;t need to do all these things you</text>
  <text start="606.579" dur="5.341">need to work for the people we already</text>
  <text start="608.889" dur="4.981">have the Constitution we have hundreds</text>
  <text start="611.92" dur="3.3">and hundreds of thousands of laws that</text>
  <text start="613.87" dur="3.99">no one even knows about they just keep</text>
  <text start="615.22" dur="6.809">passing them we don&amp;#39;t need all of it</text>
  <text start="617.86" dur="7.889">just follow what we have but nobody</text>
  <text start="622.029" dur="6">wants to that&amp;#39;s the problem now we see a</text>

  <text start="1054.95" dur="5.73">very interesting about all of this</text>
  <text start="1056.6" dur="6.06">is that as Trump was elected and he was</text>

  <text start="1108.44" dur="8.07">still pushing their agenda now in North</text>
  <text start="1113.33" dur="3.71">Korea we see that the chemical that was</text>

  <text start="1117.04" dur="6.93">in the killing of Kim Jong Un&amp;#39;s brother</text>

  <text start="1128.59" dur="5.34">deadliest chemical weapons that can be</text>
  <text start="1131.08" dur="5.1">used in a liquid cream or aerosol form</text>
  <text start="1133.93" dur="5.01">depending on the dosage whether it was</text>
  <text start="1136.18" dur="5.04">in hat inhaled or applied to the skin it</text>
  <text start="1138.94" dur="4.98">can kill as quickly as 15 minutes or</text>
  <text start="1141.22" dur="4.92">over several hours the chemical has been</text>
  <text start="1143.92" dur="5.76">featured in several popular TV movies</text>
  <text start="1146.14" dur="6.63">I&amp;#39;m going back to 1996 the film the rock</text>
  <text start="1149.68" dur="5.43">and that started on a Sean Connery and</text>
  <text start="1152.77" dur="4.98">Nicolas Cage well they used it it was in</text>
  <text start="1155.11" dur="6.9">like in a glass jar but we can see at</text>
  <text start="1157.75" dur="8.4">this point that this was used on this</text>
  <text start="1162.01" dur="7.05">individual to kill him and since that</text>
  <text start="1166.15" dur="5.49">happened we see that the corporate media</text>
  <text start="1169.06" dur="6.03">is out there saying that North Korea is</text>
  <text start="1171.64" dur="5.97">now isolated that North Korea should be</text>
  <text start="1175.09" dur="4.38">brought up on war crimes and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1177.61" dur="5.67">pushing the agenda all this was done</text>
  <text start="1179.47" dur="5.85">because Trump wanted to speak to the</text>
  <text start="1183.28" dur="5.22">North Korean leader and you can see</text>
  <text start="1185.32" dur="6.69">since he made that announcement we see</text>
  <text start="1188.5" dur="5.82">that they came down hard on North Korea</text>
  <text start="1192.01" dur="6.15">to stop this they don&amp;#39;t want that to</text>
  <text start="1194.32" dur="7.5">happen because they want war we see</text>
  <text start="1198.16" dur="5.22">Trump is seeking more nukes well I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1201.82" dur="2.97">believe we need more nuclear weapons I</text>
  <text start="1203.38" dur="4.23">think we need to get rid of nuclear</text>
  <text start="1204.79" dur="6.69">weapons we need to go back to the time</text>
  <text start="1207.61" dur="6.42">where Russia and the US both agreed on</text>
  <text start="1211.48" dur="4.89">the disarmament treaty where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1214.03" dur="5.19">going to disable the nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="1216.37" dur="8.78">disposed of them but we can see right</text>
  <text start="1219.22" dur="9.39">now this is not happening and the only</text>
  <text start="1225.15" dur="7.06">group that benefits from all of this are</text>
  <text start="1228.61" dur="7.02">those groups those corporations that</text>
  <text start="1232.21" dur="6.51">deal in war they are the ones that</text>
  <text start="1235.63" dur="5.01">benefit from all of this we see Iraq</text>
  <text start="1238.72" dur="5.37">carries out airstrikes against the</text>
  <text start="1240.64" dur="5.91">Islamic state in Syria this is the first</text>
  <text start="1244.09" dur="6.03">time they actually flew into Syria now</text>
  <text start="1246.55" dur="4.58">again Syria did not invite them to come</text>
  <text start="1250.12" dur="4.049">into their country</text>
  <text start="1251.13" dur="5.56">didn&amp;#39;t invite them to bomb inside their</text>
  <text start="1254.169" dur="5.341">country and it looks like the US was</text>
  <text start="1256.69" dur="5.099">giving Intel to Iraq to go after the</text>
  <text start="1259.51" dur="4.68">Islamic state now do we know for sure</text>
  <text start="1261.789" dur="4.74">this is what they&amp;#39;re going after not</text>
  <text start="1264.19" dur="4.29">really we see turkey and the rebel</text>
  <text start="1266.529" dur="5.491">allies they&amp;#39;ve claimed control of</text>
  <text start="1268.48" dur="5.34">Syria&amp;#39;s al Bob right now and we see that</text>
  <text start="1272.02" dur="4.68">Russia is still out there with the</text>
  <text start="1273.82" dur="7.17">Syrian armed forces battling the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1276.7" dur="7.05">state and actually bombing them the</text>
  <text start="1280.99" dur="4.86">United States Turkey well we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1283.75" dur="4.529">exactly what they&amp;#39;re really doing but</text>
  <text start="1285.85" dur="4.949">we&amp;#39;ve seen from the past that they were</text>
  <text start="1288.279" dur="4.14">never hitting the Islamic state they</text>
  <text start="1290.799" dur="3.571">were hitting the infrastructure they</text>
  <text start="1292.419" dur="3.331">were helping the Islamic state but we</text>
  <text start="1294.37" dur="3.779">can see that the Islamic state is on the</text>
  <text start="1295.75" dur="5.01">run so at this point in time they might</text>
  <text start="1298.149" dur="5.461">be doing a mop-up operation where they</text>
  <text start="1300.76" dur="7.47">need to really clean up and get rid of</text>
  <text start="1303.61" dur="7.949">the Islamic state now Russia went to the</text>
  <text start="1308.23" dur="6.09">Western countries and said listen you</text>
  <text start="1311.559" dur="6.571">should pay for all the damage inside of</text>
  <text start="1314.32" dur="6.42">Syria because you&amp;#39;ve been bombing in</text>
  <text start="1318.13" dur="5.73">this country for many years you bit hit</text>
  <text start="1320.74" dur="5.97">a lot of the infrastructure caused a lot</text>
  <text start="1323.86" dur="5.22">of damage and the Western countries</text>
  <text start="1326.71" dur="4.439">turned around and said well actually</text>
  <text start="1329.08" dur="3.839">most of the damage was caused by you so</text>
  <text start="1331.149" dur="4.38">you should pay for everything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1332.919" dur="7.051">going on there and they brought up</text>
  <text start="1335.529" dur="5.941">Aleppo and other areas and the Russians</text>
  <text start="1339.97" dur="2.85">said well we weren&amp;#39;t handing the</text>
  <text start="1341.47" dur="3.3">infrastructure we&amp;#39;re hitting the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1342.82" dur="4.709">state you actually hit the</text>
  <text start="1344.77" dur="4.59">infrastructure so we could see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1347.529" dur="4.291">happening here right now now there was a</text>
  <text start="1349.36" dur="3.9">study that was done and the study says</text>
  <text start="1351.82" dur="2.93">and this is from the international</text>
  <text start="1353.26" dur="4.409">center of this study of radicalization</text>
  <text start="1354.75" dur="4.36">where it says the profits of the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1357.669" dur="3.601">state they have plunged by fifty five</text>
  <text start="1359.11" dur="4.74">percent well they don&amp;#39;t have the oil</text>
  <text start="1361.27" dur="5.82">convoy they don&amp;#39;t have the taxes they</text>
  <text start="1363.85" dur="5.67">were collecting and the fines and we can</text>
  <text start="1367.09" dur="4.11">see right now that their money is</text>
  <text start="1369.52" dur="3.99">running out at this point so it looks</text>
  <text start="1371.2" dur="3.599">like the Islamic state is completely</text>
  <text start="1373.51" dur="4.74">dead but what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="1374.799" dur="5.221">this report it says that unless the</text>
  <text start="1378.25" dur="4.2">Islamic state can come up with a new</text>
  <text start="1380.02" dur="4.8">stream of income they&amp;#39;re done for and</text>
  <text start="1382.45" dur="4.829">they said one stream of income</text>
