  <text start="56.66" dur="5.28">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.04" dur="6.72">episode 1361 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.94" dur="5.76">August 22nd 2017 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="64.76" dur="5.55">episode is it begins Johnny pulls West&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="67.7" dur="4.89">investment dollars and redirects it east</text>
  <text start="70.31" dur="5.4">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="72.59" dur="7.08">financial news now as we know the</text>
  <text start="75.71" dur="6.69">economy well from all indicators that</text>
  <text start="79.67" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at the economy is</text>
  <text start="82.4" dur="4.38">slipping and deteriorating very very</text>
  <text start="84.53" dur="4.62">quickly but of course the government the</text>
  <text start="86.78" dur="6.12">Fed they&amp;#39;re out there telling us that</text>
  <text start="89.15" dur="5.19">the economy is doing very well right now</text>
  <text start="92.9" dur="2.88">what they&amp;#39;re telling us is that</text>
  <text start="94.34" dur="5.51">unemployment is at four point four</text>
  <text start="95.78" dur="7.32">percent and this is at a 16 year low</text>
  <text start="99.85" dur="5.8">suggesting there&amp;#39;s little of any slack</text>
  <text start="103.1" dur="6.24">in the US economy now this is according</text>
  <text start="105.65" dur="5.75">to the feds Beige Book and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="109.34" dur="5.31">saying is that we&amp;#39;re seeing shortages</text>
  <text start="111.4" dur="5.83">where they can&amp;#39;t find people to work now</text>
  <text start="114.65" dur="5.28">the National Association of Homebuilders</text>
  <text start="117.23" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;re out there also saying listen we</text>
  <text start="119.93" dur="6.87">can&amp;#39;t find qualified construction</text>
  <text start="123.11" dur="5.879">workers to work and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="126.8" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s becoming very very difficult now</text>
  <text start="128.989" dur="4.411">they&amp;#39;re all out there telling us how</text>
  <text start="131.15" dur="6.93">great everything is and then we have the</text>
  <text start="133.4" dur="7.77">new Federal Reserve survey which kind of</text>
  <text start="138.08" dur="5.61">says something a little different what</text>
  <text start="141.17" dur="5.539">they&amp;#39;re saying is for the first time US</text>
  <text start="143.69" dur="4.68">workers and jobseekers are so</text>
  <text start="146.709" dur="4.931">disenchanted with the labor situation</text>
  <text start="148.37" dur="5.97">and harbor so little hope for higher</text>
  <text start="151.64" dur="5.54">paychecks that even as they increasingly</text>
  <text start="154.34" dur="6.3">search for new jobs they are not only</text>
  <text start="157.18" dur="7.15">expecting fewer jobs and fewer offers</text>
  <text start="160.64" dur="5.04">but anticipate a lower paycheck now</text>
  <text start="164.33" dur="7.23">let&amp;#39;s think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="165.68" dur="8.91">because if they can&amp;#39;t find workers that</text>
  <text start="171.56" dur="5.67">means they&amp;#39;re going to pay a lot more</text>
  <text start="174.59" dur="6.39">money to get those people in because</text>
  <text start="177.23" dur="7.979">there&amp;#39;s few people to work now I saw</text>
  <text start="180.98" dur="6.23">this back in the 90s during the whole</text>
  <text start="185.209" dur="4.561">entire</text>
  <text start="187.21" dur="4.3">windows administration and things like</text>
  <text start="189.77" dur="5.58">that where they couldn&amp;#39;t find qualified</text>
  <text start="191.51" dur="6.21">people because it was new and what they</text>
  <text start="195.35" dur="4.74">did was they paid people who knew sequel</text>
  <text start="197.72" dur="5.49">people who knew how to administer</text>
  <text start="200.09" dur="4.85">Windows on a network they paid them</text>
  <text start="203.21" dur="4.86">quite a bit of money because they were</text>
  <text start="204.94" dur="5.23">few n there weren&amp;#39;t that many workers</text>
  <text start="208.07" dur="4.5">out there so what they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="210.17" dur="5.01">right now is that you know they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="212.57" dur="7.44">find these qualified people but people</text>
  <text start="215.18" dur="7.2">are saying that they expect lo-ove fewer</text>
  <text start="220.01" dur="5.39">job offers and lower pay</text>
  <text start="222.38" dur="6.93">now something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense here</text>
  <text start="225.4" dur="6.16">now according to the Fed survey we</text>
  <text start="229.31" dur="4.74">respond and said in July that the lowest</text>
  <text start="231.56" dur="4.26">annual salary they would accept in a new</text>
  <text start="234.05" dur="4.59">job would be around fifty seven thousand</text>
  <text start="235.82" dur="4.98">nine hundred and sixty down from fifty</text>
  <text start="238.64" dur="6.24">nine thousand six hundred and sixty only</text>
  <text start="240.8" dur="6.78">four months earlier so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="244.88" dur="5.85">looking at right now is something that</text>
  <text start="247.58" dur="5.73">really doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="250.73" dur="4.59">now we need to remember that a lot of</text>
  <text start="253.31" dur="3.66">these numbers were manipulated a lot of</text>
  <text start="255.32" dur="5.31">these numbers are fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="256.97" dur="5.76">and a lot of these jobs which brought</text>
  <text start="260.63" dur="6">down the unemployment numbers they are</text>
  <text start="262.73" dur="6.42">part-time waiter bartender and jobs like</text>
  <text start="266.63" dur="4.95">that and we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="269.15" dur="4.26">full-time high-paying jobs they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="271.58" dur="4.35">really non-existent because remember how</text>
  <text start="273.41" dur="4.95">they work all this they count a</text>
  <text start="275.93" dur="4.23">part-time job as a full-time job so if</text>
  <text start="278.36" dur="4.32">you have two part-time jobs you have two</text>
  <text start="280.16" dur="5.04">full-time jobs and this is how they were</text>
  <text start="282.68" dur="4.65">able to bring the unemployment number</text>
  <text start="285.2" dur="5.13">down now they used other manipulated</text>
  <text start="287.33" dur="6.48">tactics to massage the numbers to make</text>
  <text start="290.33" dur="5.52">it look like everything is fine now what</text>
  <text start="293.81" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the quality of</text>
  <text start="295.85" dur="6.36">available jobs they&amp;#39;re just not out</text>
  <text start="298.04" dur="7.92">there and respondents saw a 22 percent</text>
  <text start="302.21" dur="6.36">likelihood of receiving at least one job</text>
  <text start="305.96" dur="5.19">offer in the next four months down from</text>
  <text start="308.57" dur="5.61">an average response of 25 percent in</text>
  <text start="311.15" dur="6.72">eight months ago so already they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="314.18" dur="6.21">expecting to see less job offers now</text>
  <text start="317.87" dur="4.23">what&amp;#39;s very interesting at</text>
  <text start="320.39" dur="4.05">one point they&amp;#39;re saying that they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="322.1" dur="4.02">find qualified workers on another point</text>
  <text start="324.44" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re saying that we&amp;#39;re at the lowest</text>
  <text start="326.12" dur="5.43">unemployment rate and salaries are</text>
  <text start="328.58" dur="5.25">falling and people expect they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="331.55" dur="5.64">going to get any offers something</text>
  <text start="333.83" dur="5.1">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense and of course we know</text>
  <text start="337.19" dur="3.84">what that is the whole thing is a</text>
  <text start="338.93" dur="3.98">complete lie now</text>
  <text start="341.03" dur="5.06">the New York Times is reporting that</text>
  <text start="342.91" dur="5.11">there is a problem in Silicon Valley</text>
  <text start="346.09" dur="5.92">they&amp;#39;re saying that we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="348.02" dur="7.11">full-fledged housing crisis and local</text>
  <text start="352.01" dur="5.63">officials out there are worrying they</text>
  <text start="355.13" dur="5.82">saying that the affordability well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="357.64" dur="5.95">not there it&amp;#39;s very expensive people are</text>
  <text start="360.95" dur="5.73">leaving and we&amp;#39;re already getting</text>
  <text start="363.59" dur="5.4">indicators from the corporate media that</text>
  <text start="366.68" dur="6.18">there are problems now we we saw this</text>
  <text start="368.99" dur="7.23">before during the 2008 crisis when it</text>
  <text start="372.86" dur="4.98">began remember those televised shots</text>
  <text start="376.22" dur="3.24">where people were leaving their homes</text>
  <text start="377.84" dur="3.54">they couldn&amp;#39;t afford them anymore</text>
  <text start="379.46" dur="4.38">interest rates we&amp;#39;re moving up I had</text>
  <text start="381.38" dur="4.68">adjustable rate mortgages and they left</text>
  <text start="383.84" dur="4.02">you know their furniture their</text>
  <text start="386.06" dur="3">belongings and they just left the home</text>
  <text start="387.86" dur="3.99">because they just couldn&amp;#39;t afford it</text>
  <text start="389.06" dur="4.8">anymore well it looks like we might be</text>
  <text start="391.85" dur="4.02">going down this same exact path because</text>
  <text start="393.86" dur="3.9">what is happening right now is people</text>
  <text start="395.87" dur="4.44">are saying that is it is just too</text>
  <text start="397.76" dur="4.59">expensive to live in this area they</text>
  <text start="400.31" dur="5.04">can&amp;#39;t afford the homes they can&amp;#39;t bring</text>
  <text start="402.35" dur="6.27">people into the homes and right now</text>
  <text start="405.35" dur="5.97">California is in crisis mode and if</text>
  <text start="408.62" dur="5.07">these interest rates move up just a</text>
  <text start="411.32" dur="4.19">little bit it will be a complete and</text>
  <text start="413.69" dur="5.37">utter disaster</text>
  <text start="415.51" dur="6.28">now the chicago national activity index</text>
  <text start="419.06" dur="5.73">well its surprised economists with a</text>
  <text start="421.79" dur="5.7">negative reading now what is the Chicago</text>
  <text start="424.79" dur="4.83">Fed national activity index it is a</text>
  <text start="427.49" dur="5.1">monthly index designed to gauge the</text>
  <text start="429.62" dur="5.91">overall economic activity and related</text>
  <text start="432.59" dur="6.72">inflationary pressure now economists</text>
  <text start="435.53" dur="5.88">predicted a strong July reading for the</text>
  <text start="439.31" dur="5.52">Chicago Fed national activity index but</text>
  <text start="441.41" dur="6.68">what they found was a negative reading</text>
  <text start="444.83" dur="7.05">reading of negative point zero one and</text>
  <text start="448.09" dur="6.1">they expected a positive point two two</text>
  <text start="451.88" dur="5.25">so we can see already</text>
  <text start="454.19" dur="5.73">they were sideswipe they had no idea</text>
  <text start="457.13" dur="4.8">that this was going to happen but we</text>
  <text start="459.92" dur="4.5">kind of did because we&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="461.93" dur="6.24">at all these different indicators and we</text>
  <text start="464.42" dur="7.11">realized that the economy has been built</text>
  <text start="468.17" dur="6.93">up on a gigantic illusion and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="471.53" dur="6.87">happening is one sector at a time well</text>
  <text start="475.1" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s starting to fall apart and a lot of</text>
  <text start="478.4" dur="3.06">these economies are going to come out</text>
  <text start="479.6" dur="3.6">there and say we you know this was</text>
  <text start="481.46" dur="4.47">completely unexpected that&amp;#39;s the word</text>
  <text start="483.2" dur="5.67">they like to use oh it was an unexpected</text>
  <text start="485.93" dur="5.58">decline now we see Treasury secretary</text>
  <text start="488.87" dur="7.05">Steve minuchin he went out and he</text>
  <text start="491.51" dur="7.8">decided to visit Fort Knox now this is</text>
  <text start="495.92" dur="8.64">very strange because the last</text>
  <text start="499.31" dur="7.14">congressional visit was in 1974 and of</text>
  <text start="504.56" dur="4.14">course there&amp;#39;s been speculation over the</text>
  <text start="506.45" dur="4.38">existence of gold in Fort Knox many</text>
  <text start="508.7" dur="5.25">people say it is not there and he</text>
  <text start="510.83" dur="6.389">decided to go visit it now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="513.95" dur="8.01">interesting about all of this he told us</text>
  <text start="517.219" dur="7.051">that the gold is safe everything is okay</text>
  <text start="521.96" dur="5.22">now there was no camera crew there was</text>
  <text start="524.27" dur="5.46">no proof it was his him just going in</text>
  <text start="527.18" dur="6.9">there reassuring the American people</text>
  <text start="529.73" dur="8.76">that everything is fine now to me this</text>
  <text start="534.08" dur="8.37">is suspect because why can&amp;#39;t they show</text>
  <text start="538.49" dur="6.57">the American people the gold why wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="542.45" dur="5.4">there any type of proof that can be</text>
  <text start="545.06" dur="5.16">shown to the American people having</text>
  <text start="547.85" dur="4.8">someone just go down there or who knows</text>
  <text start="550.22" dur="5.43">if he actually did go down there to tell</text>
  <text start="552.65" dur="5.67">us that there&amp;#39;s gold something just</text>
  <text start="555.65" dur="5.4">isn&amp;#39;t right and he made a joke about</text>
  <text start="558.32" dur="5.46">this he said I assume the gold is still</text>
  <text start="561.05" dur="4.98">there he told an audience in Louisville</text>
  <text start="563.78" dur="5.13">Kentucky some 40 miles north of the</text>
  <text start="566.03" dur="6">biggest US bullion depository it would</text>
  <text start="568.91" dur="7.89">really be quite a movie if we walked in</text>
  <text start="572.03" dur="6.57">and there was no gold which most of us</text>
  <text start="576.8" dur="5.82">because it hasn&amp;#39;t really been an audit</text>
  <text start="578.6" dur="5.88">of the gold in Fort Knox that do we</text>
  <text start="582.62" dur="3.18">really know it is actually there and I</text>
  <text start="584.48" dur="3.09">think the American people have the right</text>
  <text start="585.8" dur="2.219">to see it I think the American people</text>
  <text start="587.57" dur="3.809">have the</text>
  <text start="588.019" dur="5.49">right to know if the gold is still there</text>
  <text start="591.379" dur="4.52">and I think it&amp;#39;s very interesting that</text>
  <text start="593.509" dur="5.461">there was no camera crew because usually</text>
  <text start="595.899" dur="5.5">these type of people like to show off</text>
  <text start="598.97" dur="4.89">they like to have camera crews they like</text>
  <text start="601.399" dur="6.18">to show you what they&amp;#39;re doing when it</text>
  <text start="603.86" dur="8.069">fits their agenda well this this is</text>
  <text start="607.579" dur="7.32">suspect once again we see that Norway&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="611.929" dur="4.95">government well their sovereign wealth</text>
  <text start="614.899" dur="5.16">fund they&amp;#39;re getting ready to buy a</text>
  <text start="616.879" dur="5.19">hundred billion dollars more in stocks</text>
  <text start="620.059" dur="3.84">and they&amp;#39;re saying this is the safeguard</text>
  <text start="622.069" dur="5.281">the country&amp;#39;s richest so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="623.899" dur="7.081">investing in stocks to safeguard the</text>
  <text start="627.35" dur="5.519">country&amp;#39;s risks and we know there are</text>
  <text start="630.98" dur="5.069">many countries around the world central</text>
  <text start="632.869" dur="6.921">banks that had been buying a huge amount</text>
  <text start="636.049" dur="7.2">of stocks to pump the stock market&amp;#39;s up</text>
  <text start="639.79" dur="5.259">to make everyone believe that things are</text>
  <text start="643.249" dur="4.95">okay we know that the Swiss National</text>
  <text start="645.049" dur="5.46">Bank they hold a lot of Apple stock so</text>
  <text start="648.199" dur="6.6">was the purchase of all these stocks</text>
  <text start="650.509" dur="7.411">really to help their investment and to</text>
  <text start="654.799" dur="7.29">safeguard the country where was it to</text>
  <text start="657.92" dur="7.229">pump the global market up and I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="662.089" dur="5.701">to say it was to pump the global market</text>
  <text start="665.149" dur="6.24">up now we talked about the belt and road</text>
  <text start="667.79" dur="6.089">system and we know that China well they</text>
  <text start="671.389" dur="5.76">have this new law where Chinese</text>
  <text start="673.879" dur="6.57">investment companies corporations they</text>
  <text start="677.149" dur="6.03">need to redirect their funds and take</text>
  <text start="680.449" dur="5.7">their investments and invest it in the</text>
  <text start="683.179" dur="6.361">belt and road system and we talked about</text>
  <text start="686.149" dur="6">this which means a lot of buildings a</text>
  <text start="689.54" dur="5.729">lot of and the entertainment industry</text>
  <text start="692.149" dur="5.85">the hospitality industry well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="695.269" dur="4.23">going to suffer for this even if I mean</text>
  <text start="697.999" dur="3.06">let&amp;#39;s say right now we&amp;#39;re at the height</text>
  <text start="699.499" dur="3.601">of the market in the real estate market</text>
  <text start="701.059" dur="4.921">in China says you know something let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="703.1" dur="5.579">start selling buildings and pulling our</text>
  <text start="705.98" dur="4.919">funds out of the country let&amp;#39;s stop all</text>
  <text start="708.679" dur="6.39">these corporations from investing in</text>
  <text start="710.899" dur="6.331">businesses in the West what happens to</text>
  <text start="715.069" dur="5.401">the economy because a lot of the economy</text>
  <text start="717.23" dur="4.6">was based on the Chinese was based on</text>
