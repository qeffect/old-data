  <text start="111.149" dur="5.521">media they&amp;#39;re going on about Mueller and</text>
  <text start="113.07" dur="6.92">how he&amp;#39;s investigating and how you know</text>
  <text start="116.67" dur="6.35">they got Flynn they got mana Ford and</text>
  <text start="119.99" dur="6.699">they&amp;#39;re going on about this FBI agent</text>
  <text start="123.02" dur="6.58">Peter stroke where they say that he was</text>
  <text start="126.689" dur="6.571">let go because you know he texted</text>
  <text start="129.6" dur="5.37">anti-trump messages now under Mueller we</text>
  <text start="133.26" dur="4.71">kind of expected that even Muller</text>
  <text start="134.97" dur="5.04">himself is anti-trump they were never</text>
  <text start="137.97" dur="4.829">for Trump so pretty much they were all</text>
  <text start="140.01" dur="5.58">anti Trump and when we look closely at</text>
  <text start="142.799" dur="5.991">this it wasn&amp;#39;t because he texted anti</text>
  <text start="145.59" dur="5.91">Trump messages he was suspended for</text>
  <text start="148.79" dur="6.16">another reason which they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="151.5" dur="5.15">bringing up because Mueller suspected</text>
  <text start="154.95" dur="5.31">that stroke was leaking classified</text>
  <text start="156.65" dur="7.149">details about his team&amp;#39;s FBI raid on</text>
  <text start="160.26" dur="5.46">Paul manna Ford&amp;#39;s house this is a story</text>
  <text start="163.799" dur="5.131">that the Washington Post first printed</text>
  <text start="165.72" dur="5.85">in August and they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="168.93" dur="4.8">warrant for manna Ford was sealed it was</text>
  <text start="171.57" dur="6.06">a sealed document was not public record</text>
  <text start="173.73" dur="8.16">and the post story offered a detailed</text>
  <text start="177.63" dur="7.23">glimpse of the pre-dawn raid of manna</text>
  <text start="181.89" dur="4.73">forts Virginia home which got his wife</text>
  <text start="184.86" dur="6.43">out of bed mana Ford out of bed</text>
  <text start="186.62" dur="8.16">and the details that were in the story</text>
  <text start="191.29" dur="5.169">where did they get it from and when when</text>
  <text start="194.78" dur="5.61">they started to look into this they</text>
  <text start="196.459" dur="7.081">realized that well stroke was the one</text>
  <text start="200.39" dur="6.269">who leaked the information and this is</text>
  <text start="203.54" dur="5.059">why they had to let him go and had</text>
  <text start="206.659" dur="4.5">nothing to do with the anti-trump text</text>
  <text start="208.599" dur="5.23">but if we see the corporate media this</text>
  <text start="211.159" dur="5.311">is what they&amp;#39;re using to say this is why</text>
  <text start="213.829" dur="4.351">they let the person go now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="216.47" dur="3.269">interesting about all of this is that</text>
  <text start="218.18" dur="4.5">Mueller&amp;#39;s probe which turned up</text>
  <text start="219.739" dur="5.25">absolutely nothing I mean they have this</text>
  <text start="222.68" dur="6.419">ridiculous case of Manta for mum</text>
  <text start="224.989" dur="8.28">laundering money they have Flynn lying</text>
  <text start="229.099" dur="7.11">to the FBI but Mueller was there to find</text>
  <text start="233.269" dur="6.84">out if there was collusion between the</text>
  <text start="236.209" dur="7.95">Trump administration and Russia and so</text>
  <text start="240.109" dur="7.05">far there&amp;#39;s nothing there&amp;#39;s nothing that</text>
  <text start="244.159" dur="6.33">he found out that shows there&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="247.159" dur="5.811">collusion and in the last six months</text>
  <text start="250.489" dur="6.81">they&amp;#39;ve been investigating and right now</text>
  <text start="252.97" dur="8.52">we see that Mueller this probe cost the</text>
  <text start="257.299" dur="6.891">American taxpayer almost seven million</text>
  <text start="261.49" dur="6.91">dollars and after six months there is</text>
  <text start="264.19" dur="7.57">absolutely nothing to show for it now</text>
  <text start="268.4" dur="5.97">when we look at this the report shows</text>
  <text start="271.76" dur="5.07">that he spent around 3.2 million of</text>
  <text start="274.37" dur="4.47">total expenditure expenditures but</text>
  <text start="276.83" dur="3.36">buried in the report is the fact that</text>
  <text start="278.84" dur="4.65">the Department of Justice spent an</text>
  <text start="280.19" dur="5.07">additional 3.5 million outside the</text>
  <text start="283.49" dur="4.77">special councils budget to support</text>
  <text start="285.26" dur="5.909">Mueller&amp;#39;s investigation which is almost</text>
  <text start="288.26" dur="6.14">7 million dollars and the largest line</text>
  <text start="291.169" dur="6.841">item for the special councils office is</text>
  <text start="294.4" dur="6.67">unsurprisingly personnel at 1.7 million</text>
  <text start="298.01" dur="5.73">and we can see that they had to pay for</text>
  <text start="301.07" dur="6.629">travel they had to pay for other</text>
  <text start="303.74" dur="7.739">information equipment and right now this</text>
  <text start="307.699" dur="5.28">is a total waste of money they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="311.479" dur="3.961">there now saying that Mueller has</text>
  <text start="312.979" dur="4.261">subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="315.44" dur="4.529">financial records now we need to</text>
  <text start="317.24" dur="7.639">remember that Congress</text>
  <text start="319.969" dur="7.17">they also were asking Deutsche Bank for</text>
  <text start="324.879" dur="4.5">financial records and Deutsche Bank says</text>
  <text start="327.139" dur="5.96">yeah well we&amp;#39;re not giving this over and</text>
  <text start="329.379" dur="7.69">Georgia Bank right now is neither</text>
  <text start="333.099" dur="6.13">confirming nor denying the existence of</text>
  <text start="337.069" dur="4.08">Trump subpoena and Trump&amp;#39;s attorney is</text>
  <text start="339.229" dur="5.61">out there denying the story completely</text>
  <text start="341.149" dur="6.18">saying yeah they never received or there</text>
  <text start="344.839" dur="3.87">was never a subpoena issued but the</text>
  <text start="347.329" dur="4.5">corporate media is out there saying that</text>
  <text start="348.709" dur="6.66">yes there was one issue now even if</text>
  <text start="351.829" dur="5.55">there is one issued this doesn&amp;#39;t show</text>
  <text start="355.369" dur="4.08">Russian collusion once again it looks</text>
  <text start="357.379" dur="4.47">like Mueller is just digging for</text>
  <text start="359.449" dur="5.27">anything right now because everything</text>
  <text start="361.849" dur="6.15">that he has there&amp;#39;s no proof of Russian</text>
  <text start="364.719" dur="5.92">collusion the whole entire thing is</text>
  <text start="367.999" dur="6.78">falling apart and it costs seven million</text>
  <text start="370.639" dur="6.51">dollars to show nothing happened we see</text>
  <text start="374.779" dur="5.64">Russia right now they have declared nine</text>
  <text start="377.149" dur="6.3">media entities foreign agents now</text>
  <text start="380.419" dur="6.691">remember the United States banned RT and</text>
  <text start="383.449" dur="6.09">Sputnik from reporting here in the</text>
  <text start="387.11" dur="6.719">United States because they made them</text>
  <text start="389.539" dur="5.46">sign up as a foreign agent and it looks</text>
  <text start="393.829" dur="3.71">like what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is</text>
  <text start="394.999" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re trying to shut down you know</text>
  <text start="397.539" dur="5.17">information from other sources now I</text>
  <text start="400.789" dur="6.75">think this might have been done on</text>
  <text start="402.709" dur="10.05">purpose to allow Russia to ban Voice of</text>
  <text start="407.539" dur="9.62">America Radio Free Europe and others to</text>
  <text start="412.759" dur="8.851">say these are all run by the cabal and</text>
  <text start="417.159" dur="6.64">we need to shut them down and it looks</text>
  <text start="421.61" dur="4.439">like this is this might be one of the</text>
  <text start="423.799" dur="3.15">reasons why this was all brought up in</text>
  <text start="426.049" dur="5.07">the first place</text>
  <text start="426.949" dur="6.93">to clean out the news organizations that</text>
  <text start="431.119" dur="5.48">are operating in other areas around the</text>
  <text start="433.879" dur="7.74">world which is spreading propaganda and</text>
  <text start="436.599" dur="8.17">we see right now that yes the RT network</text>
  <text start="441.619" dur="7.35">the Sputnik Network that is also funded</text>
  <text start="444.769" dur="6.93">by Russia and we see right now that how</text>
  <text start="448.969" dur="5.13">else can you clean out these news</text>
  <text start="451.699" dur="5.25">organizations you had to make it look</text>
  <text start="454.099" dur="4.771">oh it&amp;#39;s against Russia we need to ban</text>
  <text start="456.949" dur="4.44">Russia&amp;#39;s news organizations which</text>
  <text start="458.87" dur="4.979">allowed Russia then to ban the cabal&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="461.389" dur="4.49">news organizations remember these news</text>
  <text start="463.849" dur="4.731">organizations they&amp;#39;re run by the</text>
  <text start="465.879" dur="5.41">intelligence community they are fed</text>
  <text start="468.58" dur="5.92">stories from the intelligence community</text>
  <text start="471.289" dur="6.231">it&amp;#39;s propaganda and basically what they</text>
  <text start="474.5" dur="5.759">try to do is they try to shift the</text>
  <text start="477.52" dur="4.69">opinion of the world to what the</text>
  <text start="480.259" dur="4.351">intelligence agencies want them to</text>
  <text start="482.21" dur="3.81">believe and it looks like what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="484.61" dur="5.25">doing right now is they&amp;#39;re cleaning</text>
  <text start="486.02" dur="6.899">house we see right now that North Korea</text>
  <text start="489.86" dur="4.44">the latest ICBM that you know the</text>
  <text start="492.919" dur="3.81">corporate media was out there reporting</text>
  <text start="494.3" dur="4.889">that can hit any place in the world they</text>
  <text start="496.729" dur="6.81">can hit the United States well it looks</text>
  <text start="499.189" dur="7.26">like this ICBM well it broke up on</text>
  <text start="503.539" dur="4.38">re-entry so they&amp;#39;re looking for the</text>
  <text start="506.449" dur="5.28">pieces right now they&amp;#39;re looking for the</text>
  <text start="507.919" dur="5.821">debris on the coast of Japan and the</text>
  <text start="511.729" dur="5.67">missile flew higher and longer than its</text>
  <text start="513.74" dur="6.959">predecessors but it broke apart during</text>
  <text start="517.399" dur="5.911">re-entry and it looks like they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="520.699" dur="4.471">have a reliable heat shielding and the</text>
  <text start="523.31" dur="4.8">North Koreans they still have problems</text>
  <text start="525.17" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re not very yet but they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="528.11" dur="6.539">to use the scare factor to make everyone</text>
  <text start="531.14" dur="6.629">believe that they&amp;#39;re able to fire this</text>
  <text start="534.649" dur="5.94">missile it&amp;#39;s going to fly in a</text>
  <text start="537.769" dur="5.461">trajectory that&amp;#39;s going to hit an exact</text>
  <text start="540.589" dur="4.381">target in the u.s. actually these</text>
  <text start="543.23" dur="4.2">missiles probably won&amp;#39;t even be able to</text>
  <text start="544.97" dur="5.79">reach the u.s. before breaking up in</text>
  <text start="547.43" dur="6.33">midair the reason why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="550.76" dur="5.81">continually pushing the idea that they</text>
  <text start="553.76" dur="6.99">can do this is because of two reasons</text>
  <text start="556.57" dur="8.44">one the plan behind Russia China the</text>
  <text start="560.75" dur="7.11">u.s. is to show that North Korea is a</text>
  <text start="565.01" dur="5.579">nuclear state the plan with the Cabal is</text>
  <text start="567.86" dur="6.479">to scare everyone to think that North</text>
  <text start="570.589" dur="7.731">Korea is going to push war both of these</text>
  <text start="574.339" dur="6.98">plans are happening at the same time and</text>
  <text start="578.32" dur="5.2">they&amp;#39;re trying to show that North Korea</text>
  <text start="581.319" dur="3.76">this is why North Korea came out and</text>
  <text start="583.52" dur="4.05">said they want to be recognized as a</text>
  <text start="585.079" dur="5.431">nuclear state and have a nuclear</text>
  <text start="587.57" dur="5.25">weapon they have an ICBM it doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="590.51" dur="5.64">that well they can put the nuclear</text>
  <text start="592.82" dur="5.61">weapon on top of the missile and maybe</text>
  <text start="596.15" dur="5.31">it will get to its location but they</text>
  <text start="598.43" dur="5.34">want that designation so the Cabal</text>
  <text start="601.46" dur="4.23">doesn&amp;#39;t go in there and have regime</text>
  <text start="603.77" dur="5.07">change this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="605.69" dur="5.13">push forward this is what this is why</text>
  <text start="608.84" dur="4.23">the u.s. right now hasn&amp;#39;t done anything</text>
  <text start="610.82" dur="4.29">I mean why would they continually wait</text>
  <text start="613.07" dur="7.08">and wait and wait if this is such a big</text>
  <text start="615.11" dur="6.62">threat they didn&amp;#39;t wait in Iraq they saw</text>
  <text start="620.15" dur="5.64">they had weapons of mass destruction</text>
  <text start="621.73" dur="7.72">they went right in Syria they brought</text>
  <text start="625.79" dur="6.78">the forces right in North Korea well</text>
  <text start="629.45" dur="6.06">they&amp;#39;re not going to do it because the</text>
  <text start="632.57" dur="5.28">Cabal doesn&amp;#39;t have the ability just to</text>
  <text start="635.51" dur="5.61">say let&amp;#39;s go in there now if they create</text>
  <text start="637.85" dur="4.62">some type of an event yes the Cabal will</text>
  <text start="641.12" dur="2.85">try to push this as hard as they</text>
  <text start="642.47" dur="3.66">possibly can it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="643.97" dur="5.49">getting ready to do this they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="646.13" dur="5.46">to push the next event we have senator</text>
  <text start="649.46" dur="4.17">Graham out there saying that you know</text>
  <text start="651.59" dur="5.82">the diplomats in South Korea should be</text>
  <text start="653.63" dur="5.58">evacuated certain individuals in the</text>
  <text start="657.41" dur="3.78">Armed Forces should be evacuated and</text>
  <text start="659.21" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re trying to make it look like</text>
  <text start="661.19" dur="4.26">something is about to happen maybe</text>
  <text start="663.92" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re planning something which I</text>
  <text start="665.45" dur="4.17">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised we see the UN</text>
  <text start="667.43" dur="5.85">envoy has arrived in North Korea and</text>
  <text start="669.62" dur="7.46">they&amp;#39;re there to defuse the soaring</text>
  <text start="673.28" dur="6.84">tensions between the United States and</text>
  <text start="677.08" dur="5.19">North Korea and South Korea and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="680.12" dur="5.01">trying to calm the situation down and</text>
  <text start="682.27" dur="4.83">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is this</text>
  <text start="685.13" dur="5.67">gigantic buildup</text>
  <text start="687.1" dur="6.16">I&amp;#39;ve where the Cabal they have really</text>
  <text start="690.8" dur="4.92">nothing left the only thing they have</text>
  <text start="693.26" dur="4.32">left right now and they can try all</text>
  <text start="695.72" dur="4.26">different things they can say oh you</text>
  <text start="697.58" dur="4.2">know we&amp;#39;re staying in Syria North Korea</text>
  <text start="699.98" dur="2.82">must get rid of their nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="701.78" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re gonna come up with a lot of</text>
  <text start="702.8" dur="4.71">propaganda type of statements but the</text>
  <text start="705.41" dur="4.74">only thing they have left is some type</text>
  <text start="707.51" dur="6.63">of an event because without an event</text>
  <text start="710.15" dur="7.14">there&amp;#39;s nothing gonna happen here and as</text>
  <text start="714.14" dur="4.44">we can see nothing is happening we see</text>
  <text start="717.29" dur="4.02">right now that the Patriot missile</text>
  <text start="718.58" dur="5.22">system that the u.s. is selling to many</text>
  <text start="721.31" dur="5.21">country&amp;#39;s well it really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="723.8" dur="6.36">intercept the houthis missile that</text>
  <text start="726.52" dur="5.29">exploded in Saudi Arabia and of course</text>
  <text start="730.16" dur="3.18">the corporate media doesn&amp;#39;t want anyone</text>
  <text start="731.81" dur="2.85">to know about this the government</text>
  <text start="733.34" dur="3.72">doesn&amp;#39;t want anyone to know about this</text>
  <text start="734.66" dur="5.04">and when they looked at the hoody</text>
  <text start="737.06" dur="5.25">missile they said well let&amp;#39;s look at</text>
  <text start="739.7" dur="5.37">this for a second it hit the intended</text>
  <text start="742.31" dur="6.719">target the missile split into two pieces</text>
  <text start="745.07" dur="6.12">and we see that there was no sign that</text>
  <text start="749.029" dur="3.991">the Patriot missile actually hit the</text>
  <text start="751.19" dur="4.32">missile because the missile they fired</text>
  <text start="753.02" dur="5.55">was designed to split into two pieces</text>
  <text start="755.51" dur="5.46">and when they looked at this they said I</text>
  <text start="758.57" dur="4.65">don&amp;#39;t think the Patriot missile actually</text>
  <text start="760.97" dur="4.23">hit this missile it hit the target it</text>
  <text start="763.22" dur="5.79">did exactly what was supposed to do and</text>
  <text start="765.2" dur="6.6">this is why Japan is never going to fire</text>
  <text start="769.01" dur="4.55">upon a missile that North Korea launches</text>
  <text start="771.8" dur="4.68">because if it doesn&amp;#39;t hit it</text>
  <text start="773.56" dur="3.76">they were in big trouble the u.s. is in</text>
  <text start="776.48" dur="3.12">big trouble</text>
  <text start="777.32" dur="5.13">because it will show that we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="779.6" dur="4.65">the technology to stop missiles and</text>
  <text start="782.45" dur="4.86">remember the Patriot missile system it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="784.25" dur="4.5">old it&amp;#39;s almost obsolete the missile</text>
  <text start="787.31" dur="3.06">systems that the Chinese and the</text>
  <text start="788.75" dur="5.07">Russians are coming out with they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="790.37" dur="7.68">much more advanced we see right now that</text>
  <text start="793.82" dur="6.11">Israel has fired missiles into Syria and</text>
  <text start="798.05" dur="6.38">what I think they&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="799.93" dur="8.71">it&amp;#39;s not in an attack they&amp;#39;re testing</text>
  <text start="804.43" dur="7.27">Syria&amp;#39;s defense systems they&amp;#39;re they</text>
  <text start="808.64" dur="7.01">want to see if their defense systems</text>
  <text start="811.7" dur="6.69">will stop their missiles which they have</text>
  <text start="815.65" dur="5.23">Israel fired between six or seven</text>
  <text start="818.39" dur="4.5">missiles at Syria and this is of course</text>
  <text start="820.88" dur="5.97">a clear violation of international law</text>
  <text start="822.89" dur="5.76">Surya never attacked Israel and Syria is</text>
  <text start="826.85" dur="5.7">saying that we were able to stop these</text>
  <text start="828.65" dur="6.689">missiles now Israel they refused to</text>
  <text start="832.55" dur="5.76">comment on the incident because their</text>
  <text start="835.339" dur="5.241">missiles were intercepted and we can see</text>
  <text start="838.31" dur="6">that at this point they&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="840.58" dur="6.82">testing to see how well the technology</text>
  <text start="844.31" dur="5.85">that Russia gave to Syria works and it</text>
  <text start="847.4" dur="5.04">looks like it works very well we see the</text>
  <text start="850.16" dur="4.58">Syrian army they&amp;#39;re on the cusp of final</text>
  <text start="852.44" dur="5.08">victory over the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="854.74" dur="5.969">this makes no difference to the Cabal</text>
  <text start="857.52" dur="6.129">because we can see right now that US</text>
  <text start="860.709" dur="7.111">officials right now claim Assad is not</text>
  <text start="863.649" dur="8.461">capable of winning in a Syria war and</text>
  <text start="867.82" dur="7.92">this is why the US will need to stay in</text>
  <text start="872.11" dur="6.78">Syria now this seems absolutely</text>
  <text start="875.74" dur="7.68">ridiculous in what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="878.89" dur="7.65">here and they&amp;#39;re insisting that Assad is</text>
  <text start="883.42" dur="6.09">wholly not capable of winning this war</text>
  <text start="886.54" dur="5.4">citing massive damage to the national</text>
  <text start="889.51" dur="4.98">infrastructure huge casualties to the</text>
  <text start="891.94" dur="5.339">military that they suffered and his</text>
  <text start="894.49" dur="5.37">growing dependence on his allies this</text>
  <text start="897.279" dur="5.071">prediction and this is a prediction that</text>
  <text start="899.86" dur="5.94">the u.s. is making of not winning is</text>
  <text start="902.35" dur="5.37">likely to be the centerpiece of future</text>
  <text start="905.8" dur="4.14">us justification for keeping large</text>
  <text start="907.72" dur="5.16">numbers of ground troops in Syria</text>
  <text start="909.94" dur="4.86">now remember China and Russia have</text>
  <text start="912.88" dur="4.32">already made deals to rebuild the</text>
  <text start="914.8" dur="6.18">infrastructure China and Russia are</text>
  <text start="917.2" dur="7.5">giving the Syrian government funds to</text>
  <text start="920.98" dur="9.21">rebuild and Russia is going to stay in</text>
  <text start="924.7" dur="9.509">Syria and protect Syria from any type of</text>
  <text start="930.19" dur="7.26">paid mercenary force this argument that</text>
  <text start="934.209" dur="5.13">the Cabal is making is not gonna work I</text>
  <text start="937.45" dur="4.68">mean they&amp;#39;re citing that the</text>
  <text start="939.339" dur="5.731">infrastructure is destroyed the military</text>
  <text start="942.13" dur="5.78">is tired but we can see the military of</text>
  <text start="945.07" dur="7.8">Syria is sweeping through the country</text>
  <text start="947.91" dur="8.23">the u.s. under international law has no</text>
  <text start="952.87" dur="6.18">argument of why the US troops should</text>
  <text start="956.14" dur="6.99">stay in Syria they&amp;#39;re trying to figure</text>
  <text start="959.05" dur="7.2">out a way to keep the troops there this</text>
  <text start="963.13" dur="5.94">is what the Cabal wants and under</text>
  <text start="966.25" dur="5.31">international law it&amp;#39;s really showing</text>
  <text start="969.07" dur="4.139">that they invaded a country because</text>
  <text start="971.56" dur="3.57">Syria and Russia have already come out</text>
  <text start="973.209" dur="4.37">and said listen you must leave they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="975.13" dur="5.579">going to bring it up to the UN and</text>
  <text start="977.579" dur="6.581">they&amp;#39;re giving the u.s. the chance to</text>
  <text start="980.709" dur="4.711">leave on their own and we know right now</text>
  <text start="984.16" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re not going to do this because</text>
  <text start="985.42" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;re buying time right now</text>
  <text start="988" dur="7.56">it looks like either in Syria North</text>
  <text start="991.63" dur="6.15">Korea Iran any of these areas they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="995.56" dur="4.83">going to try to push some type of an</text>
  <text start="997.78" dur="5.16">event and they need this time to create</text>
  <text start="1000.39" dur="4.26">this event and it looks like this is</text>
  <text start="1002.94" dur="4.38">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do so it looks</text>
  <text start="1004.65" dur="4.05">like the countdown has begun it looks</text>
  <text start="1007.32" dur="3.27">like they&amp;#39;re getting ready to do</text>
  <text start="1008.7" dur="4.5">something because they have nothing left</text>
