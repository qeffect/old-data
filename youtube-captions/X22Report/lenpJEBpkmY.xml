  <text start="36" dur="5.129">808 be and today&amp;#39;s date is November</text>
  <text start="38.61" dur="5.159">third 2015 and the title of this episode</text>
  <text start="41.129" dur="6.121">is the countdown begins the push to</text>
  <text start="43.769" dur="5.641">invade Libya is a go let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="47.25" dur="4.62">economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="49.41" dur="4.649">geopolitical news now most of the people</text>
  <text start="51.87" dur="4.56">have already heard of a stingray device</text>
  <text start="54.059" dur="4.801">and this is a device which mimics a cell</text>
  <text start="56.43" dur="5.75">tower and kind of redirects your call</text>
  <text start="58.86" dur="8.25">and allows the FBI the local police to</text>
  <text start="62.18" dur="7.259">listen in on your conversation and there</text>
  <text start="67.11" dur="5.64">were new documents that were released</text>
  <text start="69.439" dur="6.161">saying that these devices may be capable</text>
  <text start="72.75" dur="5.04">of intercepting the contents of</text>
  <text start="75.6" dur="4.769">communications and therefore such</text>
  <text start="77.79" dur="5.18">devices must be configured to disable</text>
  <text start="80.369" dur="5.161">the interception function unless</text>
  <text start="82.97" dur="4.859">interceptions have been authorized by a</text>
  <text start="85.53" dur="5.43">title three order title three is a</text>
  <text start="87.829" dur="4.601">federal wiretapping law that allows law</text>
  <text start="90.96" dur="4.43">enforcement with a court order to</text>
  <text start="92.43" dur="5.88">intercept communications in real time</text>
  <text start="95.39" dur="6.82">the document also discuss the</text>
  <text start="98.31" dur="7.58">possibility of flashing a phone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="102.21" dur="6.9">firmware so that you can intercept</text>
  <text start="105.89" dur="6.46">conversations using a suspects cell</text>
  <text start="109.11" dur="6.93">phone as a bug so there&amp;#39;s a lot more to</text>
  <text start="112.35" dur="5.91">these stingray devices and a lot of</text>
  <text start="116.04" dur="5.25">these surveillance tools go by different</text>
  <text start="118.26" dur="7.38">names like wolf pack gossamer swamp box</text>
  <text start="121.29" dur="7.229">and they fit into a suitcase and we see</text>
  <text start="125.64" dur="4.979">the FBI&amp;#39;s using them to CIA is using</text>
  <text start="128.519" dur="4.981">them local police are using them and</text>
  <text start="130.619" dur="6.001">even the IRS is using them and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="133.5" dur="5.54">using a Secret Service also and most of</text>
  <text start="136.62" dur="6.3">these agencies are using them without a</text>
  <text start="139.04" dur="6.07">warrant now there&amp;#39;s been a bill that was</text>
  <text start="142.92" dur="5.01">introduced into Congress that would</text>
  <text start="145.11" dur="5.579">criminalize the use of stingrays without</text>
  <text start="147.93" dur="8.58">a warrant I mean really do we need</text>
  <text start="150.689" dur="7.86">another law in on the books to let</text>
  <text start="156.51" dur="3.78">everyone know that you can&amp;#39;t spy on the</text>
  <text start="158.549" dur="4.981">American people without a warrant don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="160.29" dur="4.23">we have the Fourth Amendment why don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="163.53" dur="5.22">we just up</text>
  <text start="164.52" dur="6.51">old the rights of the people it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="168.75" dur="6.18">lot easier than continually creating</text>
  <text start="171.03" dur="6.75">laws this is getting out of hand we</text>
  <text start="174.93" dur="4.32">already have the basics and all they</text>
  <text start="177.78" dur="3.81">have to do is refer to it oh I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>
  <text start="179.25" dur="5.48">that&amp;#39;s the law right there did you have</text>
  <text start="181.59" dur="7.25">a warrant no okay it&amp;#39;s illegal and</text>
  <text start="184.73" dur="7.81">that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s all we have to do and</text>
  <text start="188.84" dur="6.25">what we all need to do is we need to</text>
  <text start="192.54" dur="5.61">make it very very difficult for the US</text>
  <text start="195.09" dur="5.55">government central bankers to spy on us</text>
  <text start="198.15" dur="4.11">we need to send a message that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="200.64" dur="3.8">going to make it even harder and harder</text>
  <text start="202.26" dur="3.96">and harder because this is illegal</text>
  <text start="204.44" dur="3.91">actually they shouldn&amp;#39;t be doing it at</text>
  <text start="206.22" dur="4.53">all but we know we can&amp;#39;t really stop</text>
  <text start="208.35" dur="4.65">them because they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="210.75" dur="5.19">want and no court of law is going to do</text>
  <text start="213" dur="5.13">anything and they&amp;#39;re just going to</text>
  <text start="215.94" dur="4.43">continually do it so for those people</text>
  <text start="218.13" dur="6.51">who want to stop them encrypt your data</text>
  <text start="220.37" dur="7.15">use an email encryption service use</text>
  <text start="224.64" dur="4.62">start page to hide your searches they</text>
  <text start="227.52" dur="5.22">also have proxy servers which will hide</text>
  <text start="229.26" dur="5.28">your location when you do searches use a</text>
  <text start="232.74" dur="3.99">product like block it pocket you can</text>
  <text start="234.54" dur="5.61">slip your cell phone your credit card</text>
  <text start="236.73" dur="7.26">your license into these sleeves or iPads</text>
  <text start="240.15" dur="6.12">and it will block the signal because the</text>
  <text start="243.99" dur="4.44">material is interwoven with silver and</text>
  <text start="246.27" dur="5.04">copper and it blocks the radiation</text>
  <text start="248.43" dur="6.06">signal it blocks the other signal and it</text>
  <text start="251.31" dur="5.61">stops them from tracking you or from</text>
  <text start="254.49" dur="5.94">listening in on anything that&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="256.92" dur="8.36">with your phone I mean there&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="260.43" dur="8.13">different ways that we can do this and</text>
  <text start="265.28" dur="5.74">everyone should make it mud continually</text>
  <text start="268.56" dur="4.109">make it very very difficult for the</text>
  <text start="271.02" dur="4.77">government to spy on us there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="272.669" dur="4.441">reason they need to spy on us and of</text>
  <text start="275.79" dur="5.72">course it&amp;#39;s a violation of our rights</text>
  <text start="277.11" dur="7.65">now during the Baltimore and Ferguson</text>
  <text start="281.51" dur="6.7">riots the Federal Bureau of</text>
  <text start="284.76" dur="7.68">Investigation had surveillance planes</text>
  <text start="288.21" dur="8.36">flying over and above and they were</text>
  <text start="292.44" dur="5.849">using thermal imaging equipment and</text>
  <text start="296.57" dur="4.119">documents obtained by the</text>
  <text start="298.289" dur="5.22">the American Civil Liberties Union via</text>
  <text start="300.689" dur="6">the Freedom of Information Act outlined</text>
  <text start="303.509" dur="5.101">how the bureau is using planes equipped</text>
  <text start="306.689" dur="4.141">with the infrared night-vision cameras</text>
  <text start="308.61" dur="5.519">they also reveal that the FBI retains</text>
  <text start="310.83" dur="9.899">the videos for an unspecified length of</text>
  <text start="314.129" dur="10.59">time we also find out that these planes</text>
  <text start="320.729" dur="5.761">are using the Stingray devices to listen</text>
  <text start="324.719" dur="5.73">in on all the conversations that were</text>
  <text start="326.49" dur="6.629">going on during the protests again all</text>
  <text start="330.449" dur="7.68">this violation of our Fourth Amendment</text>
  <text start="333.119" dur="5.94">and the question is why were they doing</text>
  <text start="338.129" dur="2.611">of course they&amp;#39;re going to use the</text>
  <text start="339.059" dur="3.42">reason well we&amp;#39;re making sure that</text>
  <text start="340.74" dur="4.259">everything was contained that things</text>
  <text start="342.479" dur="4.791">weren&amp;#39;t getting out of hand and we know</text>
  <text start="344.999" dur="4.5">they were looking for specific groups</text>
  <text start="347.27" dur="3.579">they were looking for specific people</text>
  <text start="349.499" dur="3.57">they wanted to hear what they were</text>
  <text start="350.849" dur="4.231">saying it was almost like Occupy Wall</text>
  <text start="353.069" dur="4.261">Street where DHS admitted they had</text>
  <text start="355.08" dur="4.41">snipers standing by to take out the</text>
  <text start="357.33" dur="8.25">protesters if it went too far if they</text>
  <text start="359.49" dur="8.699">push too hard against the bankers so we</text>
  <text start="365.58" dur="4.649">can see right now these agencies they</text>
  <text start="368.189" dur="5.37">are not working for their people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="370.229" dur="7.201">working against the people and they will</text>
  <text start="373.559" dur="8.7">do whatever they have to to spy on each</text>
  <text start="377.43" dur="6.18">one of us to make a case even if it</text>
  <text start="382.259" dur="4.71">violates our rights it doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="383.61" dur="5.489">matter now out in Cuba we understand</text>
  <text start="386.969" dur="5.97">wherever Russia is that&amp;#39;s where the</text>
  <text start="389.099" dur="7.11">United States has to go and we see Cuba</text>
  <text start="392.939" dur="7.95">is asking Russia right now for more</text>
  <text start="396.209" dur="7.92">business they want economic development</text>
  <text start="400.889" dur="6.45">on the island from Russia Russia right</text>
  <text start="404.129" dur="5.64">now has no plans on reopening their</text>
  <text start="407.339" dur="4.98">military base in Cuba but if you notice</text>
  <text start="409.769" dur="7.32">the United States had to go back into</text>
  <text start="412.319" dur="5.97">Cuba because wherever Russia is the</text>
  <text start="417.089" dur="3.51">United States has to be there and they</text>
  <text start="418.289" dur="7.011">were very worried that Russia was</text>
  <text start="420.599" dur="8.07">reestablishing relations with Cuba or</text>
  <text start="425.3" dur="5.079">ramping up relations with Cuba doing a</text>
  <text start="428.669" dur="3.601">lot of business with them and they were</text>
  <text start="430.379" dur="3.061">very worried they&amp;#39;re going to reopen the</text>
  <text start="432.27" dur="3.15">Terry base because he has a remember</text>
  <text start="433.44" dur="5.04">coup Cuba is right off the coast of</text>
  <text start="435.42" dur="5.73">Florida here very very close and this is</text>
  <text start="438.48" dur="4.56">why they said okay we&amp;#39;re going back into</text>
  <text start="441.15" dur="3.39">Cuba because wherever Russia or China is</text>
  <text start="443.04" dur="3.75">this is where the United States is and</text>
  <text start="444.54" dur="6.81">they realize they need to do this</text>
  <text start="446.79" dur="6.72">because when they start the war they</text>
  <text start="451.35" dur="3.75">need to make sure they&amp;#39;re in all the</text>
  <text start="453.51" dur="3.6">different locations and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="455.1" dur="5.01">pre-positioned and this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="457.11" dur="5.97">doing right now now Ukraine is</text>
  <text start="460.11" dur="5.73">continually shelling Donetsk right now</text>
  <text start="463.08" dur="6.15">and the suburbs of Donetsk overnight</text>
  <text start="465.84" dur="5.01">they were shelling and this is again in</text>
  <text start="469.23" dur="4.53">violation of the immense to cease fire</text>
  <text start="470.85" dur="4.5">agreement but as we know it is expires</text>
  <text start="473.76" dur="3.15">at the end of this year and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="475.35" dur="5.21">to have to watch us very very carefully</text>
  <text start="476.91" dur="6.81">to see how this plays out now poroshenko</text>
  <text start="480.56" dur="6.31">he just signed the bill allowing</text>
  <text start="483.72" dur="6.68">foreigners to serve in Ukrainian army</text>
  <text start="486.87" dur="6.24">very interesting the law states that</text>
  <text start="490.4" dur="5.14">foreigners and stateless persons may</text>
  <text start="493.11" dur="4.65">become officers of the Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="495.54" dur="6.48">military only after attaining the</text>
  <text start="497.76" dur="7.86">country&amp;#39;s citizenship so they just have</text>
  <text start="502.02" dur="5.7">to go in there obtain the citizenship</text>
  <text start="505.62" dur="5.13">and they can serve in the armed forces</text>
  <text start="507.72" dur="6.6">making it very very easy to go in and</text>
  <text start="510.75" dur="5.7">fight now out in Japan we understand the</text>
  <text start="514.32" dur="4.77">United States wants to set up this new</text>
  <text start="516.45" dur="4.14">base in Okinawa it&amp;#39;s going to be a much</text>
  <text start="519.09" dur="3.69">larger base they can bring in more</text>
  <text start="520.59" dur="3.87">advanced weapons and the people of</text>
  <text start="522.78" dur="4.53">Okinawa the authorities there that</text>
  <text start="524.46" dur="6.65">especially the governor they&amp;#39;re giving</text>
  <text start="527.31" dur="8.1">the United States a very very rough time</text>
  <text start="531.11" dur="7.63">Okinawa governor takahashi Anagha said</text>
  <text start="535.41" dur="5.67">absolutely not he will do whatever he</text>
  <text start="538.74" dur="5.97">has to to make sure the United States</text>
  <text start="541.08" dur="5.04">does not build a new base now we</text>
  <text start="544.71" dur="3.3">understand why the United States want to</text>
  <text start="546.12" dur="3.57">do this because they are setting up in</text>
  <text start="548.01" dur="3.18">pre positioning military assets to</text>
  <text start="549.69" dur="4.47">encircle China which they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="551.19" dur="6.48">for a quite a while they have a lot of</text>
  <text start="554.16" dur="5.46">missile defense systems in this area</text>
  <text start="557.67" dur="4.56">they have a lot of the fleet in this</text>
  <text start="559.62" dur="5.4">area and we can see the United States is</text>
  <text start="562.23" dur="3.91">already provoking China and right now</text>
  <text start="565.02" dur="2.95">the u.s. pledges</text>
  <text start="566.14" dur="5.07">to continually patrol these areas and</text>
  <text start="567.97" dur="7.14">may might make it a quarterly type of</text>
  <text start="571.21" dur="5.93">patrol any South China Sea so every</text>
  <text start="575.11" dur="6.39">quarter they&amp;#39;re going to be provoking</text>
  <text start="577.14" dur="7">China and they&amp;#39;re just hoping that China</text>
  <text start="581.5" dur="6.21">lashes out and does something so they</text>
  <text start="584.14" dur="6.27">can start this war now it looks like in</text>
  <text start="587.71" dur="5.16">Libya things are starting to heat up at</text>
  <text start="590.41" dur="4.23">this point we understand talks have</text>
  <text start="592.87" dur="4.92">broken down there they&amp;#39;re still trying</text>
  <text start="594.64" dur="5.73">the UN is still pushing both governments</text>
  <text start="597.79" dur="5.25">to come to some type of agreement in un</text>
  <text start="600.37" dur="4.92">to have maybe a dual government but as</text>
  <text start="603.04" dur="3.27">we know the puppet government of Libya</text>
  <text start="605.29" dur="3.39">which is controlled by the Unites States</text>
  <text start="606.31" dur="3.84">government central bankers in the end</text>
  <text start="608.68" dur="4.56">they do not want this they want full</text>
  <text start="610.15" dur="6.03">control and the elected government in</text>
  <text start="613.24" dur="4.71">Libya that is based out of Tripoli they</text>
  <text start="616.18" dur="5.43">are saying you know something it is time</text>
  <text start="617.95" dur="6.75">that the world recognizes that we are</text>
  <text start="621.61" dur="5.48">the government now of course the United</text>
  <text start="624.7" dur="7.02">States is not going to do this and</text>
  <text start="627.09" dur="8.92">they&amp;#39;re saying listen we need you to</text>
  <text start="631.72" dur="6.24">recognize us and you should recognize us</text>
  <text start="636.01" dur="3.75">and of course there&amp;#39;s other propaganda</text>
  <text start="637.96" dur="6.27">along with this to make the seem like</text>
  <text start="639.76" dur="7.98">this government will do something to</text>
  <text start="644.23" dur="6.66">force other countries hands now this</text>
  <text start="647.74" dur="4.92">seems to me like propaganda where</text>
  <text start="650.89" dur="7.29">they&amp;#39;re saying listen we will let</text>
  <text start="652.66" dur="7.29">refugees come out of Libya we will not</text>
  <text start="658.18" dur="4.41">stop them we&amp;#39;ll just open our borders</text>
  <text start="659.95" dur="6.24">and we&amp;#39;ll let them go right into Europe</text>
  <text start="662.59" dur="7.62">unless you recognize us and to me this</text>
  <text start="666.19" dur="6.9">seems like it&amp;#39;s the beginning of the</text>
  <text start="670.21" dur="6.39">propaganda of why they&amp;#39;re going to need</text>
  <text start="673.09" dur="6.87">to go into Libya and something strange</text>
  <text start="676.6" dur="6.17">right now is happening in Libya Libya&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="679.96" dur="6.2">petroleum facilities guard halted all</text>
  <text start="682.77" dur="6.25">crude shipments from the port</text>
  <text start="686.16" dur="5.23">indefinitely because of what has been</text>
  <text start="689.02" dur="4.47">happening in Libya right now now you</text>
  <text start="691.39" dur="3.12">have to remember there are two</text>
  <text start="693.49" dur="4.1">governments there&amp;#39;s the puppet</text>
  <text start="694.51" dur="5.28">government which no longer is in Tripoli</text>
  <text start="697.59" dur="4.84">Tripoli right now the governor</text>
  <text start="699.79" dur="4.86">there which was elected controls the</text>
  <text start="702.43" dur="3.75">shipment of oil now of course they can</text>
  <text start="704.65" dur="3.57">sell the oil not using the dollar which</text>
  <text start="706.18" dur="4.35">most likely they are maybe they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="708.22" dur="5.94">selling it using the you on the ruble</text>
  <text start="710.53" dur="5.37">gold or silver the puppet government</text>
  <text start="714.16" dur="3.9">moved the central bank out of Tripoli</text>
  <text start="715.9" dur="5.19">hoping that other countries would do</text>

  <text start="721.09" dur="4.8">countries are doing business with</text>
  <text start="722.55" dur="5.14">Tripoli this is a problem so now they</text>
  <text start="725.89" dur="4.8">decided that they are stopping all</text>
  <text start="727.69" dur="7.74">shipments whatsoever now will the</text>
  <text start="730.69" dur="7.41">government of Libya who is located in</text>
  <text start="735.43" dur="6.48">Tripoli abide by this most likely not</text>
  <text start="738.1" dur="8.76">and they&amp;#39;re the ones who control the</text>
  <text start="741.91" dur="8.67">port in Tripoli so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="746.86" dur="6.54">right now is a ramp up to an escalation</text>
  <text start="750.58" dur="6.36">it seems like the United States</text>
  <text start="753.4" dur="6.78">government central bankers they have the</text>
  <text start="756.94" dur="6.93">green light for the go ahead to do</text>
  <text start="760.18" dur="5.66">something in Libya now how and what is</text>
  <text start="763.87" dur="4.29">going to play out in Libya right now</text>
  <text start="765.84" dur="3.85">unclear because we know the United</text>
  <text start="768.16" dur="3.33">States government central bankers they</text>
  <text start="769.69" dur="4.44">can&amp;#39;t just go into Libya well they could</text>
  <text start="771.49" dur="3.63">but that would be completely illegal and</text>
  <text start="774.13" dur="3.6">the rest of the world would look at this</text>
  <text start="775.12" dur="4.26">and say whoa whoa just a minute there is</text>
  <text start="777.73" dur="5.58">no authorization for this you didn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="779.38" dur="6.54">authorization from the UN but they did</text>
  <text start="783.31" dur="5.16">it in Yemen with Saudi Arabia and no one</text>
  <text start="785.92" dur="5.28">said a word and Yemen did not attack</text>
  <text start="788.47" dur="4.14">Saudi Arabia so we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="791.2" dur="5.15">see how this plays out most likely will</text>
  <text start="792.61" dur="5.91">be some type of false flag and I</text>
  <text start="796.35" dur="5.2">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if there is a</text>
  <text start="798.52" dur="5.22">another proxy army like Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="801.55" dur="5.55">going into Libya to reestablish the</text>
  <text start="803.74" dur="5.61">puppet government there and this has</text>
  <text start="807.1" dur="3.9">been in the works for quite a while we</text>
  <text start="809.35" dur="5.04">know France has been setting up bases</text>
  <text start="811" dur="6.45">around and outside of Libya Egypt along</text>
  <text start="814.39" dur="4.89">with that and we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="817.45" dur="3.9">watch and say and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="819.28" dur="6.96">surprised if this happens sooner than</text>
  <text start="821.35" dur="7.26">later now in Syria the Russian Jets have</text>
  <text start="826.24" dur="5.85">been destroying over 2,000 terrorist</text>
  <text start="828.61" dur="5.09">targets in September 30th Russia has</text>
  <text start="832.09" dur="7.17">carried out about one</text>
  <text start="833.7" dur="9.15">631 sorties destroyed about 2084 Islamic</text>

  <text start="853.83" dur="6.25">manufacturing rockets landmines since</text>
  <text start="857.29" dur="5.93">sep tember 30th and the US has done what</text>
  <text start="860.08" dur="7.71">oh that&amp;#39;s right they hit grain silos</text>
  <text start="863.22" dur="6.58">they hit oil refineries they hit the</text>
  <text start="867.79" dur="4.98">power infrastructure and a level in</text>
  <text start="869.8" dur="6.42">Aleppo and took out all the power to all</text>
  <text start="872.77" dur="5.55">the people so we could see right now the</text>
  <text start="876.22" dur="3.03">United States on one hand was not</text>
  <text start="878.32" dur="2.91">hitting the Islamic state targets</text>
  <text start="879.25" dur="5.91">because it is their proxy army and</text>
  <text start="881.23" dur="7.86">Russia is now the United States is</text>
  <text start="885.16" dur="6.84">backed into a corner and we see that</text>
  <text start="889.09" dur="6.24">Russia and the US they&amp;#39;re holding joint</text>
  <text start="892" dur="5.13">exercises in Syria and they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="895.33" dur="5.16">joint drills to make sure that they</text>
  <text start="897.13" dur="6.99">don&amp;#39;t have any type of midair accident</text>
  <text start="900.49" dur="6.33">and we can see right now Russia is</text>
  <text start="904.12" dur="4.47">continually saying listen we need to do</text>
  <text start="906.82" dur="4.59">this we&amp;#39;re both in the country were both</text>
  <text start="908.59" dur="4.23">going after the Islamic state and we</text>
  <text start="911.41" dur="3.3">want to make sure we don&amp;#39;t have any type</text>
  <text start="912.82" dur="3.87">of midair collision now the rest of the</text>
  <text start="914.71" dur="4.26">world is looking in on this and saying</text>
  <text start="916.69" dur="3.84">yeah why don&amp;#39;t you do this it makes</text>
  <text start="918.97" dur="3.15">sense to you&amp;#39;re both fighting the same</text>
  <text start="920.53" dur="4.56">enemy why aren&amp;#39;t you even working</text>
  <text start="922.12" dur="7.52">together well we know the reason for</text>
  <text start="925.09" dur="7.62">that so right now we see Russia</text>
  <text start="929.64" dur="5.98">continually pushing negotiations between</text>
  <text start="932.71" dur="4.5">assad and the Syrian opposition and of</text>
  <text start="935.62" dur="5.51">course Iran is involved United States is</text>
  <text start="937.21" dur="7.44">involved and right now the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="941.13" dur="7.63">negotiating from a very very weak</text>
  <text start="944.65" dur="6.33">position because the Free Syrian Army is</text>
  <text start="948.76" dur="3.81">kind of non-existent the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="950.98" dur="2.91">they can&amp;#39;t come out and say we support</text>
  <text start="952.57" dur="4.02">them because those are the terrorists</text>
  <text start="953.89" dur="6.78">and the United States has nothing left</text>
  <text start="956.59" dur="8.16">and the Islamic state is being</text>
  <text start="960.67" dur="6.48">completely destroyed in Syria and right</text>
  <text start="964.75" dur="6">now we can see that Russia</text>
  <text start="967.15" dur="7.49">and the Iranians well they&amp;#39;ll be able to</text>
  <text start="970.75" dur="6.23">dictate the terms to Washington and</text>
  <text start="974.64" dur="6.07">Assad right now is prepared to negotiate</text>
  <text start="976.98" dur="5.26">with some of the opposition groups now I</text>
  <text start="980.71" dur="4.86">see all over the corporate media today</text>
  <text start="982.24" dur="6.15">saying that yes Russia doesn&amp;#39;t care if</text>
  <text start="985.57" dur="5.58">Assad stays in power that&amp;#39;s not really</text>
  <text start="988.39" dur="4.77">no this is what they&amp;#39;re saying they</text>
  <text start="991.15" dur="6.23">asked whether it was crucial for Moscow</text>
  <text start="993.16" dur="7.98">that Assad stays Maria Zakharova said on</text>
  <text start="997.38" dur="6.46">the radio absolutely not we never said</text>
  <text start="1001.14" dur="6.75">that what we did say is a regime change</text>
  <text start="1003.84" dur="7.11">in syria could become a local or even</text>
  <text start="1007.89" dur="7.14">regional catastrophe adding that the</text>
  <text start="1010.95" dur="7.77">only that only Syrian people can decide</text>
  <text start="1015.03" dur="6.51">the president&amp;#39;s fate so what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1018.72" dur="4.23">doing right now here in the United</text>
  <text start="1021.54" dur="2.76">States and the corporate media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1022.95" dur="3.9">trying to say that Russia is going to</text>
  <text start="1024.3" dur="4.46">Russia saying that they don&amp;#39;t care if</text>
  <text start="1026.85" dur="8.28">Assad in power and he can be removed</text>
  <text start="1028.76" dur="9.1">Russia is saying yes Assad his fate will</text>
  <text start="1035.13" dur="5.22">be decided by the people the UN has come</text>
  <text start="1037.86" dur="4.68">out and said the people must decide and</text>
  <text start="1040.35" dur="7.14">this backs the United States into a</text>
  <text start="1042.54" dur="7.8">corner remember Assad won the election</text>
  <text start="1047.49" dur="9.27">by 86 to eighty-seven percent the people</text>
  <text start="1050.34" dur="9.81">voted for him now if Assad agrees to</text>
  <text start="1056.76" dur="8.13">have a new election and the people vote</text>
  <text start="1060.15" dur="8.58">for him once again all the plans united</text>
  <text start="1064.89" dur="6.12">states have go down the toilet they</text>
  <text start="1068.73" dur="4.59">can&amp;#39;t make a case anymore that the</text>
  <text start="1071.01" dur="6.15">people don&amp;#39;t want him and this is what</text>
  <text start="1073.32" dur="8.22">russia wants to do they already know the</text>
  <text start="1077.16" dur="6.72">people are behind him this whole Civil</text>
  <text start="1081.54" dur="7.28">War was made up by the United States</text>
  <text start="1083.88" dur="8.97">Russia knows this Assad knows this and</text>
  <text start="1088.82" dur="6.61">the United States will not let this</text>
  <text start="1092.85" dur="4.8">happen they&amp;#39;re never going to take it to</text>
  <text start="1095.43" dur="3.84">the stage where the people are going to</text>
  <text start="1097.65" dur="3.42">decide the United States doesn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1099.27" dur="3.48">the people to decide you</text>
  <text start="1101.07" dur="3.719">nited states government central bankers</text>
  <text start="1102.75" dur="5.1">want to decide who should be in power</text>
  <text start="1104.789" dur="5.551">and who should not be in power and all</text>
  <text start="1107.85" dur="3.72">these places where you see the United</text>
  <text start="1110.34" dur="3.51">States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="1111.57" dur="5.969">pushing democracy and freedom and that</text>
  <text start="1113.85" dur="6.59">people have the right no these are all</text>
  <text start="1117.539" dur="8.1">created to remove the elected government</text>
  <text start="1120.44" dur="7.42">and they pay a lot of money for all</text>
  <text start="1125.639" dur="5.971">these paid mercenaries to get the people</text>
  <text start="1127.86" dur="5.039">going to remove that government this is</text>
  <text start="1131.61" dur="4.37">what happened Ukraine Libya Yemen</text>
  <text start="1132.899" dur="5.461">Lebanon and once those governments are</text>
  <text start="1135.98" dur="5.35">removed and they put a puppet government</text>
  <text start="1138.36" dur="6.63">in that people don&amp;#39;t have the right</text>
  <text start="1141.33" dur="7.679">anymore look at Yemen look at Libya look</text>
  <text start="1144.99" dur="7.2">at Ukraine the United States turns</text>
  <text start="1149.009" dur="5.091">around and calls those same people you</text>
  <text start="1152.19" dur="5.969">know the people of that country</text>
  <text start="1154.1" dur="7.48">terrorists before they were backing them</text>
  <text start="1158.159" dur="5.941">to get rid of the elected government now</text>
  <text start="1161.58" dur="5.849">the White House is continually saying</text>
  <text start="1164.1" dur="4.89">that the US troops in Syria they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1167.429" dur="4.86">going to be in combat don&amp;#39;t worry about</text>
  <text start="1168.99" dur="6.929">it but it looks like that they&amp;#39;re lying</text>
  <text start="1172.289" dur="6.301">once again deputy national security</text>
  <text start="1175.919" dur="5.01">adviser Ben Rhodes conceded that the</text>
  <text start="1178.59" dur="5.25">troops will be going out on raids</text>
  <text start="1180.929" dur="4.85">against the Islamic state which we know</text>
  <text start="1183.84" dur="4.829">this is not going to be happening if</text>
  <text start="1185.779" dur="5.051">they&amp;#39;re doing any type of raids it&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="1188.669" dur="4.681">capture the intelligence in those areas</text>
  <text start="1190.83" dur="4.77">and desist and to destroy it so no</text>
  <text start="1193.35" dur="3.569">evidence goes back to the United States</text>
  <text start="1195.6" dur="4.289">government that they&amp;#39;re supporting the</text>
  <text start="1196.919" dur="6.21">Islamic state secondly if they bring in</text>
  <text start="1199.889" dur="5.4">30 to 50 us ground troops into the area</text>
  <text start="1203.129" dur="5.491">it makes it harder for Russia to bond</text>
  <text start="1205.289" dur="7.711">that area because if a US soldier gets</text>
  <text start="1208.62" dur="8.789">hit by a Russian bomb or missile this</text>
  <text start="1213" dur="9.659">could pose problems and this is their</text>
  <text start="1217.409" dur="8.461">plan right now is all they have so what</text>
  <text start="1222.659" dur="6.75">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that these 30 to 50</text>
  <text start="1225.87" dur="5.37">troops which were there already Obama</text>
  <text start="1229.409" dur="3.99">just came out with it saying yes we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1231.24" dur="3.72">going to be sending them so if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1233.399" dur="3.601">caught if the United States</text>
  <text start="1234.96" dur="4.199">central bankers are caught having troops</text>
  <text start="1237" dur="5.6">in Syria this is how they can explain it</text>
  <text start="1239.159" dur="6.061">away so right now there&amp;#39;s two purposes</text>
  <text start="1242.6" dur="3.97">it&amp;#39;s basically to be in the area of the</text>
  <text start="1245.22" dur="3.839">Islamic state so Russia doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1246.57" dur="3.87">continually bomb this area second is to</text>
  <text start="1249.059" dur="4.11">get rid of any type of intelligence</text>
  <text start="1250.44" dur="5.25">whatsoever that links the United States</text>
  <text start="1253.169" dur="4.201">government central bankers to the</text>
  <text start="1255.69" dur="6.239">Islamic state and this could be through</text>
  <text start="1257.37" dur="7.169">CIA FBI or any other agency now the</text>
  <text start="1261.929" dur="7.141">United States came out and said they had</text>
  <text start="1264.539" dur="8.671">their satellites pick up a flash from</text>
  <text start="1269.07" dur="6.3">the Russian plane now the US</text>
  <text start="1273.21" dur="4.14">intelligence community believes that</text>
  <text start="1275.37" dur="4.23">either a fuel tank exploded or there was</text>
  <text start="1277.35" dur="5.67">a bomb because they saw a heat signature</text>
  <text start="1279.6" dur="5.64">and flash from the u.s. satellites well</text>
  <text start="1283.02" dur="5.129">the United States just backed themselves</text>
  <text start="1285.24" dur="10.08">into another corner here because during</text>
  <text start="1288.149" dur="9.331">the mh17 crash the United States said</text>
  <text start="1295.32" dur="5.07">yeah our satellites show absolutely</text>
  <text start="1297.48" dur="4.77">nothing now the United States even went</text>
  <text start="1300.39" dur="3.93">further to say we know it wasn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="1302.25" dur="6.12">missile because we did not see the heat</text>
  <text start="1304.32" dur="6.95">signature trail from a missile hit the</text>
  <text start="1308.37" dur="5.909">plane so the technology is there to</text>
  <text start="1311.27" dur="7.57">capture a heat signature from a missile</text>
  <text start="1314.279" dur="6.481">hmm they&amp;#39;re saying that oh no our</text>
  <text start="1318.84" dur="3.18">satellites didn&amp;#39;t pick up anything over</text>
  <text start="1320.76" dur="4.47">that area and you know they had it</text>
  <text start="1322.02" dur="4.8">focused in on that area you know they</text>
  <text start="1325.23" dur="3.63">are continually looking and they picked</text>
  <text start="1326.82" dur="5.43">it up they didn&amp;#39;t want to release the</text>
  <text start="1328.86" dur="9.66">data in Ukraine because it would show</text>
  <text start="1332.25" dur="8.13">that Kiev fired the missile so what</text>
  <text start="1338.52" dur="3.33">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the United</text>
  <text start="1340.38" dur="3.84">States as they continually opening their</text>
  <text start="1341.85" dur="4.079">mouth is they&amp;#39;re putting themselves in</text>
  <text start="1344.22" dur="3.929">the corner and showing the world that</text>
  <text start="1345.929" dur="7.951">yes they do have the technology to</text>
  <text start="1348.149" dur="9.601">capture this type of information now</text>
  <text start="1353.88" dur="6.24">there&amp;#39;s a doctor who&amp;#39;s been looking at</text>
  <text start="1357.75" dur="5.25">the bodies and they&amp;#39;re saying a lot of</text>
  <text start="1360.12" dur="5.97">the passengers right now they show they</text>
  <text start="1363" dur="5.399">indicate that an explosion took place</text>
  <text start="1366.09" dur="2.819">because of the passenger injuries from</text>
  <text start="1368.399" dur="3.24">the jet</text>
  <text start="1368.909" dur="4.65">and they&amp;#39;re saying a large number of</text>
  <text start="1371.639" dur="3.451">body parts may indicate that a powerful</text>
  <text start="1373.559" dur="3.45">explosion took place aboard the plane</text>
  <text start="1375.09" dur="3.179">before it hit the ground now we still</text>
  <text start="1377.009" dur="3.951">don&amp;#39;t know what it is they found the</text>
  <text start="1378.269" dur="5.671">black boxes they&amp;#39;re going through it and</text>
  <text start="1380.96" dur="5.26">we&amp;#39;re just waiting to hear what exactly</text>
  <text start="1383.94" dur="5.119">happened here was it a bomb was it a</text>
  <text start="1386.22" dur="4.769">fuel tank was there something else that</text>
  <text start="1389.059" dur="4.84">malfunctioned that caused this to happen</text>
  <text start="1390.989" dur="7.351">we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see but if it was</text>
  <text start="1393.899" dur="5.551">a bomb we know that this came from one</text>
  <text start="1398.34" dur="6.419">of the agencies of the United States</text>
  <text start="1399.45" dur="11.969">government Israel to send a message stop</text>
