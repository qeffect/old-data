  <text start="63.11" dur="4.86">is October 12 2017 and thought of the</text>
  <text start="65.39" dur="6.15">episode is the Cabal is scrambling they</text>
  <text start="67.97" dur="5.28">are losing control let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="71.54" dur="4.5">economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="73.25" dur="4.979">geopolitical news now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="76.04" dur="4.29">discussing Obamacare for quite a while</text>
  <text start="78.229" dur="3.481">and it looks like Trump is gonna be</text>
  <text start="80.33" dur="5.19">signing the executive order to begin</text>
  <text start="81.71" dur="6.57">unwinding Obamacare and this executive</text>
  <text start="85.52" dur="5.01">order will direct federal agencies to</text>
  <text start="88.28" dur="3.99">take actions aimed at providing</text>
  <text start="90.53" dur="3.99">lower-cost options and fostering</text>
  <text start="92.27" dur="3.93">competition in the individual insurance</text>
  <text start="94.52" dur="3.36">markets now</text>
  <text start="96.2" dur="3.27">Trump&amp;#39;s orders seek to expand the</text>
  <text start="97.88" dur="3.75">ability of small businesses and other</text>
  <text start="99.47" dur="4.7">groups to band together to buy health</text>
  <text start="101.63" dur="5.94">insurance through what are known as</text>
  <text start="104.17" dur="4.99">Association health plans and also lift</text>
  <text start="107.57" dur="4.32">limits on short-term health insurance</text>
  <text start="109.16" dur="5.43">plans in some ways the orders impact</text>
  <text start="111.89" dur="3.96">remains a mystery as the full extent of</text>
  <text start="114.59" dur="4.05">the effects will not be immediately</text>
  <text start="115.85" dur="5.19">clear now the executive order largely</text>
  <text start="118.64" dur="4.589">does not make changes itself rather it</text>
  <text start="121.04" dur="4.83">directs agencies to issue new</text>
  <text start="123.229" dur="4.171">regulations or guidance those new rules</text>
  <text start="125.87" dur="5.04">will go through a notice and comment</text>
  <text start="127.4" dur="5.52">period that could take months and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="130.91" dur="4.38">have to see what this really does when I</text>
  <text start="132.92" dur="4.26">think it&amp;#39;s going to do is going to allow</text>
  <text start="135.29" dur="4.229">these individuals to purchase insurance</text>
  <text start="137.18" dur="5.22">over state lines it&amp;#39;s going to allow</text>
  <text start="139.519" dur="6">competition hopefully drive down the</text>
  <text start="142.4" dur="5.55">cost of insurance and at the same time</text>
  <text start="145.519" dur="6.621">it&amp;#39;s going to destroy Obamacare because</text>
  <text start="147.95" dur="7.56">this is exactly what is going to happen</text>
  <text start="152.14" dur="5.53">because Obamacare is already in a death</text>
  <text start="155.51" dur="4.62">spiral and we need to remember something</text>
  <text start="157.67" dur="4.59">very important here they keep talking</text>
  <text start="160.13" dur="4.32">about all the people that are going to</text>
  <text start="162.26" dur="4.61">lose their insurance they never talk</text>
  <text start="164.45" dur="5.22">about the millions of people that</text>
  <text start="166.87" dur="5.8">couldn&amp;#39;t afford the insurance now think</text>
  <text start="169.67" dur="9.289">about this for a second twelve point</text>
  <text start="172.67" dur="9.02">seven million taxpayers opted out of</text>
  <text start="178.959" dur="5.801">Obamacare because it was too expensive</text>
  <text start="181.69" dur="5.53">where did this 12 point 7 million people</text>
  <text start="184.76" dur="6.66">come from it came from the</text>
  <text start="187.22" dur="8.58">Internal Revenue Service remember you</text>
  <text start="191.42" dur="7.08">paid a penalty this is how we know how</text>
  <text start="195.8" dur="5.34">many people don&amp;#39;t have insurance because</text>
  <text start="198.5" dur="7.35">it was just completely unaffordable they</text>
  <text start="201.14" dur="7.68">couldn&amp;#39;t afford it but we never hear the</text>
  <text start="205.85" dur="5.79">people in Congress talk about this all</text>
  <text start="208.82" dur="3.75">the people twelve point seven million</text>
  <text start="211.64" dur="2.34">you know what they say</text>
  <text start="212.57" dur="2.97">well twelve twenty million going to be</text>
  <text start="213.98" dur="3.3">losing their insurance what about the</text>
  <text start="215.54" dur="6.72">twelve point seven who couldn&amp;#39;t afford</text>
  <text start="217.28" dur="6.57">it what about those individuals they</text>
  <text start="222.26" dur="3.66">forget about those people I remember a</text>
  <text start="223.85" dur="3.51">lot of the twenty million well they</text>
  <text start="225.92" dur="3.36">already had health insurance before</text>
  <text start="227.36" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re not really gonna lose it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="229.28" dur="4.62">talking about all the subsidized people</text>
  <text start="231.86" dur="4.17">where they&amp;#39;re not really paying for it</text>
  <text start="233.9" dur="3.87">the government is paying for it and we</text>
  <text start="236.03" dur="4.05">broke apart those numbers once before</text>
  <text start="237.77" dur="4.59">and we could see that that number is</text>
  <text start="240.08" dur="5.55">much much lower than they even tell us</text>
  <text start="242.36" dur="5.4">but they never say well you know if we</text>
  <text start="245.63" dur="3.63">get rid of Obamacare maybe these 12</text>
  <text start="247.76" dur="4.92">million people will be able to afford</text>
  <text start="249.26" dur="7.05">insurance they never talk about that and</text>
  <text start="252.68" dur="6.779">once again if Obamacare so great why</text>
  <text start="256.31" dur="6.27">didn&amp;#39;t the entire government sign onto</text>
  <text start="259.459" dur="6.031">it why did they keep their own now we</text>
  <text start="262.58" dur="4.47">know that Facebook was out there Google</text>
  <text start="265.49" dur="3.33">was out there and they were telling us</text>
  <text start="267.05" dur="6.06">that you know Russia took out these ads</text>
  <text start="268.82" dur="6.95">and what we found out is that these ads</text>
  <text start="273.11" dur="6.57">these Russian ads they were purchased by</text>
  <text start="275.77" dur="6.01">Americans not Russia and they were</text>
  <text start="279.68" dur="3.93">purchased by certain groups now of</text>
  <text start="281.78" dur="3.84">course they&amp;#39;re just looking at these ads</text>
  <text start="283.61" dur="4.35">and they&amp;#39;re saying that well you know it</text>
  <text start="285.62" dur="3.87">is all because of Russia but it really</text>
  <text start="287.96" dur="3.03">turns out that it wasn&amp;#39;t in a lot of</text>
  <text start="289.49" dur="3.87">these ads didn&amp;#39;t even run a lot of them</text>
  <text start="290.99" dur="4.44">Ryan ran afterwards and it looks like</text>
  <text start="293.36" dur="3.9">every time they try to explain this and</text>
  <text start="295.43" dur="4.11">every time they try to use this</text>
  <text start="297.26" dur="4.65">propaganda they get themselves into a</text>
  <text start="299.54" dur="5.12">huge amount of trouble because the truth</text>
  <text start="301.91" dur="6">always comes out you can&amp;#39;t back up</text>
  <text start="304.66" dur="5.29">propaganda it never works because what</text>
  <text start="307.91" dur="4.98">happens is when people look at it and</text>
  <text start="309.95" dur="5.73">they want proof guess what that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="312.89" dur="5.399">it falls apart we see that North Korea</text>
  <text start="315.68" dur="5.43">they already stated that they&amp;#39;re never</text>
  <text start="318.289" dur="5.191">going to give up their nuclear</text>
  <text start="321.11" dur="5.25">and they&amp;#39;re saying that they need the</text>
  <text start="323.48" dur="5.43">nuclear program because it creates and</text>
  <text start="326.36" dur="5.01">guarantees peace and security in the</text>
  <text start="328.91" dur="3.99">region why do they say this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="331.37" dur="6.59">saying this because they saw what</text>
  <text start="332.9" dur="10.019">happened in Lebanon Libya Syria Iraq</text>
  <text start="337.96" dur="8.05">Sudan Somalia Ukraine they got the</text>
  <text start="342.919" dur="5.671">message they know if they&amp;#39;re not a</text>
  <text start="346.01" dur="4.8">nuclear state and no they&amp;#39;re not firing</text>
  <text start="348.59" dur="5.46">a nuclear missile at the United States</text>
  <text start="350.81" dur="6.99">or South Korea they would it would be</text>
  <text start="354.05" dur="7.74">absolutely insane for them to do this</text>
  <text start="357.8" dur="6.06">Kim jong-un is not stupid he&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="361.79" dur="5.099">to do this and destroy his country it</text>
  <text start="363.86" dur="5.19">makes no sense whatsoever it&amp;#39;s not even</text>
  <text start="366.889" dur="5.25">about destroying the country the country</text>
  <text start="369.05" dur="4.44">would be invaded and it would be</text>
  <text start="372.139" dur="5.581">completely taken over</text>
  <text start="373.49" dur="7.35">he knows this they all know this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="377.72" dur="5.43">using this nuclear technology and</text>
  <text start="380.84" dur="4.47">missile technology to protect themselves</text>
  <text start="383.15" dur="4.26">from regime change</text>
  <text start="385.31" dur="6.479">the only way that we&amp;#39;ll get into any</text>
  <text start="387.41" dur="7.41">type of war as if the Cabal creates some</text>
  <text start="391.789" dur="6.6">type of false flag now North Korea came</text>
  <text start="394.82" dur="6.659">out and they recognized Crimea as being</text>
  <text start="398.389" dur="5.941">part of Russia which tells me just from</text>
  <text start="401.479" dur="4.651">that that Russia and China they&amp;#39;re fully</text>
  <text start="404.33" dur="4.94">onboard with North Korea developing a</text>
  <text start="406.13" dur="6.659">nuclear weapon and a missile system and</text>
  <text start="409.27" dur="5.769">we can see that they&amp;#39;re hoping that they</text>
  <text start="412.789" dur="5.551">will do this because once they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="415.039" dur="5.821">this and completed this guess what the</text>
  <text start="418.34" dur="5.54">Cabal can&amp;#39;t do anything at this point in</text>
  <text start="420.86" dur="6.029">time and we know that Europe Tillerson</text>
  <text start="423.88" dur="5.92">Russia China South Korea North Korea</text>
  <text start="426.889" dur="4.201">behind the scenes they are in peace</text>
  <text start="429.8" dur="3.839">talks right now</text>
  <text start="431.09" dur="4.65">now a couple reports ago we mentioned</text>
  <text start="433.639" dur="6.631">how the house leadership they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="435.74" dur="8.22">to be attempting to basically revoke the</text>
  <text start="440.27" dur="5.55">current resolution 81 which basically</text>
  <text start="443.96" dur="3.959">means that they would end u.s.</text>
  <text start="445.82" dur="6">involvement in the Saudi war in Yemen</text>
  <text start="447.919" dur="6.421">now the House unanimously decide decided</text>
  <text start="451.82" dur="2.819">to delay the vote on the resolution to</text>
  <text start="454.34" dur="3.18">No</text>
  <text start="454.639" dur="5.161">second now the resolution directs the</text>
  <text start="457.52" dur="4.919">president to end all military</text>
  <text start="459.8" dur="6.989">participation in the Saudi war in Yemen</text>
  <text start="462.439" dur="8.28">immediately now once again the United</text>
  <text start="466.789" dur="7.68">States never or Congress never voted for</text>
  <text start="470.719" dur="6.45">this war the United States is involved</text>
  <text start="474.469" dur="5.31">in the war they&amp;#39;re refueling planes for</text>
  <text start="477.169" dur="6.24">Saudi Arabia they&amp;#39;re supplying equipment</text>
  <text start="479.779" dur="7.531">and the United States is involved now a</text>
  <text start="483.409" dur="6.51">lot of Americans don&amp;#39;t realize that this</text>
  <text start="487.31" dur="4.74">was never authorized that this was just</text>
  <text start="489.919" dur="4.351">done under the Obama administration and</text>
  <text start="492.05" dur="4.549">Congress now needs to vote to say you</text>
  <text start="494.27" dur="5.489">know something we can&amp;#39;t do this anymore</text>
  <text start="496.599" dur="5.771">we need to pull everything back just</text>
  <text start="499.759" dur="5.4">like the United States is pulling out of</text>
  <text start="502.37" dur="4.949">Syria yes the intelligence agencies the</text>
  <text start="505.159" dur="3.991">cabal they&amp;#39;re still trying to push the</text>
  <text start="507.319" dur="3.96">agenda there but eventually what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="509.15" dur="4.049">to happen is we&amp;#39;re gonna be pulled out</text>
  <text start="511.279" dur="3.75">of Syria we&amp;#39;re gonna be pulled out of</text>
  <text start="513.199" dur="2.791">Iraq we&amp;#39;re gonna be pulled out of many</text>
  <text start="515.029" dur="5.401">of these countries because what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="515.99" dur="8.64">happening is there&amp;#39;s a slow pivot away</text>
  <text start="520.43" dur="6.56">from the u.s. to Russia and Russia is</text>
  <text start="524.63" dur="5.73">getting involved in all these countries</text>
  <text start="526.99" dur="5.89">negotiating peace deals and we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="530.36" dur="4.289">this happen in real time right in front</text>
  <text start="532.88" dur="3.36">of our face earlier one right now is</text>
  <text start="534.649" dur="5.851">telling the United States listen</text>
  <text start="536.24" dur="5.61">point-blank we don&amp;#39;t need you now think</text>
  <text start="540.5" dur="3.48">about this for a second there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="541.85" dur="4.109">countries out there that are no longer</text>
  <text start="543.98" dur="4.68">dealing in the dollar so they don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="545.959" dur="6.06">the dollar and they&amp;#39;re working with</text>
  <text start="548.66" dur="5.13">China and Russia and these countries</text>
  <text start="552.019" dur="4.081">that are working with China Russia they</text>
  <text start="553.79" dur="3.81">are becoming braver and braver where</text>
  <text start="556.1" dur="3.359">they&amp;#39;re standing up to the United States</text>
  <text start="557.6" dur="4.59">and saying listen you can&amp;#39;t push us</text>
  <text start="559.459" dur="5.461">around any more we don&amp;#39;t care we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="562.19" dur="5.73">you know abiding by your sanctions we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="564.92" dur="5.25">going around it which means the Cabal is</text>
  <text start="567.92" dur="4.109">going to be losing a lot of power right</text>
  <text start="570.17" dur="5.4">now the Cabal is scrambling they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="572.029" dur="4.74">know what to do they&amp;#39;re in trouble the</text>
  <text start="575.57" dur="3.15">only thing they have left and we</text>
  <text start="576.769" dur="3.151">mentioned this before is to use the</text>
  <text start="578.72" dur="3.21">nuclear option and I&amp;#39;m not saying a</text>
  <text start="579.92" dur="3.81">nuclear war it might turn into that but</text>
  <text start="581.93" dur="3.99">I&amp;#39;m talking about an event of all events</text>
  <text start="583.73" dur="4.41">to make everyone believe that we need to</text>
  <text start="585.92" dur="2.55">get into war it looks like we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="588.14" dur="2.01">down the</text>
  <text start="588.47" dur="4.2">path maybe it will happen maybe it won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="590.15" dur="4.26">but it looks like they&amp;#39;re building the</text>
  <text start="592.67" dur="3.81">propaganda up right now because we saw</text>
  <text start="594.41" dur="3.69">on many of the corporate media stations</text>
  <text start="596.48" dur="4.2">that they&amp;#39;re talking about how North</text>
  <text start="598.1" dur="4.23">Korea can bring down the power grid so</text>
  <text start="600.68" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re starting the propaganda already</text>
  <text start="602.33" dur="5.28">to convince us that this is going to</text>
  <text start="604.7" dur="6.66">happen they even tried to convince us</text>
  <text start="607.61" dur="5.55">that Kaspersky Labs well they have the</text>
  <text start="611.36" dur="3.84">ability to go into the financial</text>
  <text start="613.16" dur="4.26">institutions they have the ability to go</text>
  <text start="615.2" dur="4.35">into the power grid and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="617.42" dur="6.27">to make it seem like that copper ski lab</text>
  <text start="619.55" dur="6.12">is responsible for hacking into the</text>
  <text start="623.69" dur="5.28">United States into many different</text>
  <text start="625.67" dur="5.49">systems and they&amp;#39;ve been calling for all</text>
  <text start="628.97" dur="4.2">corporations to remove Kaspersky what</text>
  <text start="631.16" dur="3.84">really happened was Chris Persky and</text>
  <text start="633.17" dur="5.37">their virus detection their malware</text>
  <text start="635" dur="7.83">detection detected the NSA malware and</text>
  <text start="638.54" dur="7.47">it basically showed the world that it</text>
  <text start="642.83" dur="5.34">was the NSA that embedded malware into</text>
  <text start="646.01" dur="4.65">many of the systems and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="648.17" dur="4.35">corporations to understand and know this</text>
  <text start="650.66" dur="4.41">or the people around the world to know</text>
  <text start="652.52" dur="4.26">this that there&amp;#39;s malware in all of</text>
  <text start="655.07" dur="4.44">these systems where they can flip a</text>
  <text start="656.78" dur="5.28">switch not a physical switch but they</text>
  <text start="659.51" dur="4.56">can send a command to these pieces of</text>
  <text start="662.06" dur="3.66">malware and have them do what they need</text>
  <text start="664.07" dur="3.66">you know whatever they want to be done</text>
  <text start="665.72" dur="4.47">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="667.73" dur="4.11">Kaspersky is saying okay you&amp;#39;re telling</text>
