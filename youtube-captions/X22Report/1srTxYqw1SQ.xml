  <text start="60.64" dur="6.45">today&amp;#39;s date is June 8th 2018 and the</text>
  <text start="64.239" dur="4.74">top of the episode is wealth inequality</text>
  <text start="67.09" dur="5.46">just hit the 1929 Great Depression</text>
  <text start="68.979" dur="5.851">levels now what let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="72.55" dur="6.39">economic collapse financial news now we</text>
  <text start="74.83" dur="6.21">know that Argentina is imploding and we</text>
  <text start="78.94" dur="4.95">see a lot of countries where they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="81.04" dur="5.55">a huge amount of debt and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="83.89" dur="5.64">to make ends meet and it&amp;#39;s becoming very</text>
  <text start="86.59" dur="7.32">very difficult and what we see here is</text>
  <text start="89.53" dur="7.979">that the IMF they decided we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="93.91" dur="5.37">bailout Argentina now really they had no</text>
  <text start="97.509" dur="4.561">choice but to do this because if they</text>
  <text start="99.28" dur="4.71">let Argentina fail everyone will be</text>
  <text start="102.07" dur="4.049">point fingers at the central banker</text>
  <text start="103.99" dur="6.6">saying look what you did to this country</text>
  <text start="106.119" dur="8.401">so the best policy is to give them more</text>
  <text start="110.59" dur="7.169">debt now Argentina right now is being</text>
  <text start="114.52" dur="7.349">bailed out with the biggest ever loan in</text>
  <text start="117.759" dur="7.89">high in IMF history this is around 50</text>
  <text start="121.869" dur="7.021">billion dollars and this is a 36 month</text>
  <text start="125.649" dur="5.491">standby loan and coming in about 10</text>
  <text start="128.89" dur="3.99">billion more than rumor earlier in the</text>
  <text start="131.14" dur="5.129">week and of course as we always know</text>
  <text start="132.88" dur="4.949">it&amp;#39;s always a lot more than what they</text>
  <text start="136.269" dur="2.851">originally thought and I believe this is</text>
  <text start="137.829" dur="3.061">probably getting me to go further than</text>
  <text start="139.12" dur="3.78">50 billion because this is not going to</text>
  <text start="140.89" dur="3.42">help the country it&amp;#39;s gonna keep them in</text>
  <text start="142.9" dur="2.76">limbo and they&amp;#39;re gonna end up in the</text>
  <text start="144.31" dur="3.6">same exact place look at all the other</text>
  <text start="145.66" dur="5.43">countries that receive more and more</text>
  <text start="147.91" dur="6.75">debt you can&amp;#39;t dig your way out of debt</text>
  <text start="151.09" dur="6.69">with more debt it doesn&amp;#39;t work but what</text>
  <text start="154.66" dur="5.88">the central bankers always do is they</text>
  <text start="157.78" dur="5.34">place restrictions they put different</text>
  <text start="160.54" dur="5.43">policies in place the country has to</text>
  <text start="163.12" dur="4.8">push austerity on the people and this is</text>
  <text start="165.97" dur="5.13">what we&amp;#39;re going to see actually the</text>
  <text start="167.92" dur="5.43">people always pay the price it&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="171.1" dur="4.44">government&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not the policymakers</text>
  <text start="173.35" dur="4.22">it&amp;#39;s not the wealthy it&amp;#39;s none of these</text>
  <text start="175.54" dur="4.74">people it&amp;#39;s always the everyday</text>
  <text start="177.57" dur="6.31">hard-working people that have to pay the</text>
  <text start="180.28" dur="5.61">price for this debt this is how the</text>
  <text start="183.88" dur="5.01">central banking system works</text>
  <text start="185.89" dur="4.41">we see out in the UK well things are not</text>
  <text start="188.89" dur="4.02">going well there we know there is a</text>
  <text start="190.3" dur="4.71">housing bubble problem there we know</text>
  <text start="192.91" dur="3.69">there is a retail problem there we know</text>
  <text start="195.01" dur="3.57">the economy&amp;#39;s not doing well and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="196.6" dur="5.31">not just the UK as we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="198.58" dur="5.97">Australia it&amp;#39;s Canada the United States</text>
  <text start="201.91" dur="4.62">throughout Europe it&amp;#39;s all hitting every</text>
  <text start="204.55" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s hitting everywhere all at the same</text>
  <text start="206.53" dur="5.28">time and we see that the department</text>
  <text start="209.32" dur="4.7">store House of Fraser is saying it it</text>
  <text start="211.81" dur="6.69">has plans to close over half its stores</text>
  <text start="214.02" dur="7.42">including its flagship store in London&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="218.5" dur="4.77">Oxford Street and the company filed</text>
  <text start="221.44" dur="4.62">plans in court Wednesday to close about</text>
  <text start="223.27" dur="6.18">31 stores and put over about 6,000</text>
  <text start="226.06" dur="4.8">people out of work and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="229.45" dur="3.24">this is all because of online everything</text>
  <text start="230.86" dur="4.92">went online we don&amp;#39;t need the stores</text>
  <text start="232.69" dur="5.61">this is absolutely ridiculous all these</text>
  <text start="235.78" dur="5.55">stores have an online presence</text>
  <text start="238.3" dur="5.61">they all have their system in</text>
  <text start="241.33" dur="4.92">brick-and-mortar they all have it online</text>
  <text start="243.91" dur="4.7">so it makes no sense whatsoever and we</text>
  <text start="246.25" dur="6.33">know in the retail industry online</text>
  <text start="248.61" dur="5.83">doesn&amp;#39;t make up even half of what the</text>
  <text start="252.58" dur="5.49">brick-and-mortar stores are selling</text>
  <text start="254.44" dur="5.76">their sales and we see that this is a</text>
  <text start="258.07" dur="5.01">completely fake and phony news story</text>
  <text start="260.2" dur="5.09">what&amp;#39;s happening is that people just</text>
  <text start="263.08" dur="4.68">can&amp;#39;t afford to go out shopping</text>
  <text start="265.29" dur="4.45">yesterday in the report I talked about</text>
  <text start="267.76" dur="4.65">how the central banks they can&amp;#39;t control</text>
  <text start="269.74" dur="4.95">the spending they can&amp;#39;t control getting</text>
  <text start="272.41" dur="3.93">people jobs they can&amp;#39;t control any of</text>
  <text start="274.69" dur="4.8">that and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing so</text>
  <text start="276.34" dur="5.31">what they do is they create a narrative</text>
  <text start="279.49" dur="3.6">to make you think that oh it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="281.65" dur="2.79">because people don&amp;#39;t have jobs it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="283.09" dur="3.63">because people are making enough money</text>
  <text start="284.44" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s not because the way the system is</text>
  <text start="286.72" dur="3.87">today it&amp;#39;s all about online and they</text>
  <text start="288.88" dur="3.63">always do this actually before they were</text>
  <text start="290.59" dur="4.29">mentioning online they used to blame all</text>
  <text start="292.51" dur="5.73">the retail sales when they declined on</text>
  <text start="294.88" dur="6.09">whether now in every part of the world</text>
  <text start="298.24" dur="4.32">you&amp;#39;re getting bad weather no so that</text>
  <text start="300.97" dur="3.87">story never made sense so they had to</text>
  <text start="302.56" dur="3.96">move it to online sales if there was no</text>
  <text start="304.84" dur="3.12">such thing as online sales guess what</text>
  <text start="306.52" dur="4.41">they would have thought of another</text>
  <text start="307.96" dur="6.11">excuse to use we see right now that US</text>
  <text start="310.93" dur="6.78">consumer credit growth well it is slowed</text>
  <text start="314.07" dur="5.059">now following last month&amp;#39;s notable</text>
  <text start="317.71" dur="3.879">slowdown in the growth of</text>
  <text start="319.129" dur="6.54">consumer credit its weakest since</text>
  <text start="321.589" dur="5.521">September of 2017 the expectations were</text>
  <text start="325.669" dur="5.1">that there was going to be this</text>
  <text start="327.11" dur="6.629">incredible bounce in April and it looks</text>
  <text start="330.769" dur="5.58">like there was no bounce Bianco research</text>
  <text start="333.739" dur="4.591">noted ahead of this data consumer</text>
  <text start="336.349" dur="6.511">spending has been rolling over into the</text>
  <text start="338.33" dur="8.759">spring of 2018 and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="342.86" dur="8.639">here is that people have reached their</text>
  <text start="347.089" dur="7.92">limits and credit spending and they</text>
  <text start="351.499" dur="6.331">don&amp;#39;t have any more to give now take</text>
  <text start="355.009" dur="5.19">this and put it with what is happening</text>
  <text start="357.83" dur="6.03">with the savings rate which is declining</text>
  <text start="360.199" dur="5.7">right now so we hit the limit on credit</text>
  <text start="363.86" dur="5.489">spending people&amp;#39;s credit cards are just</text>
  <text start="365.899" dur="8.18">too high and they don&amp;#39;t have any money</text>
  <text start="369.349" dur="8.34">saved and add to this credit card</text>
  <text start="374.079" dur="4.33">delinquencies and basically Bianco</text>
  <text start="377.689" dur="2.73">research</text>
  <text start="378.409" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;re expecting credit card</text>
  <text start="380.419" dur="5.67">delinquencies to climb and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="384.499" dur="5.64">saying that it&amp;#39;s going to be climbing</text>
  <text start="386.089" dur="8.16">over this year and next year and credit</text>
  <text start="390.139" dur="7.32">searchers are also falling led by home</text>
  <text start="394.249" dur="7.801">financing and we see that this is going</text>
  <text start="397.459" dur="8.64">to be a huge problem and what does this</text>
  <text start="402.05" dur="6.449">mean this means that the credit most</text>
  <text start="406.099" dur="5.43">likely is going to end up freezing we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="408.499" dur="4.92">seen this before back in 2008 I actually</text>
  <text start="411.529" dur="5.55">Bill halter has been mentioning this</text>
  <text start="413.419" dur="6.571">quite a bit and we are now looking at a</text>
  <text start="417.079" dur="5.49">situation where everything is going to</text>
  <text start="419.99" dur="5.819">freeze up and we&amp;#39;re gonna most likely</text>
  <text start="422.569" dur="6.24">see the credit card usage drop we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="425.809" dur="6.21">already seeing the US consumer credit</text>
  <text start="428.809" dur="5.16">net change continually decline this is</text>
  <text start="432.019" dur="3.9">gonna decline further yes they will pay</text>
  <text start="433.969" dur="4.92">off some of their credit cards they will</text>
  <text start="435.919" dur="6.24">use the credit because people just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="438.889" dur="5.971">have a way of making ends meet and as</text>
  <text start="442.159" dur="4.56">the cost of living continually rises and</text>
  <text start="444.86" dur="2.88">we know that wages aren&amp;#39;t keeping up</text>
  <text start="446.719" dur="3.391">with the cost of living a lot of</text>
  <text start="447.74" dur="5.37">individuals have Murray</text>

  <text start="453.11" dur="5.76">is going to decline and this is what</text>
  <text start="454.94" dur="7.92">we&amp;#39;re seeing now add on top of that the</text>
  <text start="458.87" dur="6.54">housing problem now we&amp;#39;ve known that the</text>
  <text start="462.86" dur="4.83">housing market has been in the bubble we</text>
  <text start="465.41" dur="4.89">understand that these houses are</text>
  <text start="467.69" dur="4.229">overvalued they&amp;#39;ve been pushed up to</text>
  <text start="470.3" dur="5.25">make everyone believe that the economy</text>
  <text start="471.919" dur="7.071">is doing well remember the the the</text>
  <text start="475.55" dur="7.5">illusion that the central bankers use is</text>
  <text start="478.99" dur="7.179">they push up housing prices once housing</text>
  <text start="483.05" dur="6.45">prices continually rise people get this</text>
  <text start="486.169" dur="5.671">sense of everything is ok I have money</text>
  <text start="489.5" dur="6.3">in the house of course this is not</text>
  <text start="491.84" dur="6.419">really your wealth because it&amp;#39;s on paper</text>
  <text start="495.8" dur="4.26">you&amp;#39;d have to sell your health to get</text>
  <text start="498.259" dur="3.271">that wealth but people feel comfortable</text>
  <text start="500.06" dur="2.579">and a lot of people go out and say you</text>

  <text start="502.639" dur="5.521">equity line of credit and I&amp;#39;m gonna go</text>
  <text start="504.62" dur="6.21">use it in retail and buy things but this</text>
  <text start="508.16" dur="6.6">time this really didn&amp;#39;t happen we know</text>
  <text start="510.83" dur="6.329">that Case Shiller has been reporting on</text>
  <text start="514.76" dur="5.159">20 cities we know that the central banks</text>
  <text start="517.159" dur="4.771">have pushed the bubbles up in 20 cities</text>

  <text start="620.99" dur="5.25">homes are overvalued which means we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="624.56" dur="3.27">gonna see the same thing happen that</text>
  <text start="626.24" dur="4.11">happened in 2008 but this time is going</text>
  <text start="627.83" dur="4.56">to be worse because everything is</text>
  <text start="630.35" dur="3.78">artificial today the whole thing is just</text>
  <text start="632.39" dur="5.43">gonna come crashing down and once it</text>

  <text start="695.66" dur="5.52">bankers did was create this gigantic</text>
  <text start="697.85" dur="5.46">illusion they made you believe that</text>
  <text start="701.18" dur="4.56">everything was great everyone feels good</text>
  <text start="703.31" dur="5.88">the banks were propped up with money</text>
  <text start="705.74" dur="5.37">printing the government they manipulated</text>
  <text start="709.19" dur="3.93">statistics to make you think that</text>
  <text start="711.11" dur="4.74">everything was great so when everything</text>
  <text start="713.12" dur="3.36">falls apart all of that is going to be</text>
  <text start="715.85" dur="3.63">exposed</text>
  <text start="716.48" dur="5.49">truth will come out of this gigantic</text>
  <text start="719.48" dur="4.83">illusion just like it did in 2008 if we</text>
  <text start="721.97" dur="4.77">go back to that time subprime securities</text>
  <text start="724.31" dur="4.17">they weren&amp;#39;t triple-a all these</text>
  <text start="726.74" dur="3.149">corporations they did bailouts they knew</text>
  <text start="728.48" dur="4.169">they needed bailout they knew that these</text>
  <text start="729.889" dur="5.01">companies were failing credit froze up</text>
  <text start="732.649" dur="4.891">they knew that this was all happening at</text>
  <text start="734.899" dur="3.391">the same exact time we also see</text>
  <text start="737.54" dur="3.27">something else very interesting</text>
  <text start="738.29" dur="5.28">happening we see that household wealth</text>
  <text start="740.81" dur="4.95">right now well it has hit all-time highs</text>
  <text start="743.57" dur="4.23">of about a hundred trillion for the</text>
  <text start="745.76" dur="3.93">first time ever now</text>
  <text start="747.8" dur="4.38">everyone&amp;#39;s probably thinking this sounds</text>
  <text start="749.69" dur="6.18">great this is fantastic</text>
  <text start="752.18" dur="6.779">but this is a problem here let&amp;#39;s go and</text>
  <text start="755.87" dur="7.44">look at the feds latest flow of funds</text>
  <text start="758.959" dur="7.56">report which was released yesterday the</text>
  <text start="763.31" dur="6.18">Fed unveiled the latest snapshot of the</text>
  <text start="766.519" dur="7.021">US household sector as of March 31st</text>
  <text start="769.49" dur="5.52">2018 it revealed that a hundred and</text>
  <text start="773.54" dur="4.2">sixteen point three trillion in assets</text>
  <text start="775.01" dur="4.889">and a modest fifteen point six trillion</text>
  <text start="777.74" dur="5.459">and liabilities the net worth of US</text>
  <text start="779.899" dur="6.031">households rose above 100 trillion for</text>
  <text start="783.199" dur="4.921">the first time ever hitting a new</text>
  <text start="785.93" dur="4.08">all-time high of a hundred point eight</text>
  <text start="788.12" dur="5.699">trillion increasing for ten consecutive</text>
  <text start="790.01" dur="7.35">quarters and this would be great news it</text>
  <text start="793.819" dur="6.061">would be fantastic saying that Wow all</text>
  <text start="797.36" dur="5.479">Americans they&amp;#39;re wealthy but when you</text>
  <text start="799.88" dur="7.56">look at this there&amp;#39;s a problem</text>
  <text start="802.839" dur="11.771">almost all the net worth guess where it</text>
  <text start="807.44" dur="10.32">went to the 1% the 1% have all the</text>
  <text start="814.61" dur="6.719">wealth right now the wealth inequality</text>
  <text start="817.76" dur="6.09">in the u.s. is now as bad bad as it as</text>
  <text start="821.329" dur="4.681">it was during the Great Depression with</text>
  <text start="823.85" dur="5.219">the top point one percent of the US</text>
  <text start="826.01" dur="7.35">population owning as many assets as the</text>
  <text start="829.069" dur="6.811">bottom 90% so we are back to where we</text>
  <text start="833.36" dur="6">were right before the Great Depression</text>
  <text start="835.88" dur="7.38">hit I mean let&amp;#39;s think about this for a</text>
  <text start="839.36" dur="8.25">second and this entire economy is built</text>
  <text start="843.26" dur="6.12">on a gigantic illusion the economy is</text>
  <text start="847.61" dur="4.74">failing</text>
  <text start="849.38" dur="5.04">and everyone remembers ben bernanke who</text>
  <text start="852.35" dur="3.72">was head of the Fed where he couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="854.42" dur="3.87">forecast anything in the year that we</text>
  <text start="856.07" dur="5.49">had the recession all of a sudden he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="858.29" dur="4.65">an expert at forecasting and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="861.56" dur="4.74">that the US economy is going to go off</text>
  <text start="862.94" dur="5.19">the cliff in 2020 most likely we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="866.3" dur="5.7">gonna see the economy go off the cliff</text>
  <text start="868.13" dur="6.69">way before that and we&amp;#39;re gonna see more</text>
  <text start="872" dur="6.15">and more signs of the economy failing</text>
  <text start="874.82" dur="5.73">and we know that what is happening here</text>
  <text start="878.15" dur="5.04">is that the economy was always going to</text>
  <text start="880.55" dur="4.95">fail it was never going to make it past</text>
  <text start="883.19" dur="5.01">this point actually I made it a lot</text>
  <text start="885.5" dur="4.71">further than anyone even thought it</text>
  <text start="888.2" dur="3.54">could make it but we can see right now</text>
  <text start="890.21" dur="4.5">with all the indicators and all the</text>
  <text start="891.74" dur="4.41">signs the entire system is just</text>
  <text start="894.71" dur="3.21">imploding everywhere and it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="896.15" dur="3.48">imploding in the United States we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="897.92" dur="5.85">seeing all the signs now in other</text>
  <text start="899.63" dur="6.48">countries which is a bad omen we also</text>
  <text start="903.77" dur="3.63">see it with the banking system look at</text>
  <text start="906.11" dur="3.63">Deutsche Bank today look at the Italian</text>
  <text start="907.4" dur="5.19">banks look what&amp;#39;s happening here look at</text>
  <text start="909.74" dur="5.82">the countries of origin Tina look at the</text>
  <text start="912.59" dur="5.49">country of Venezuela look at all these</text>
  <text start="915.56" dur="4.38">countries look at Jordan where people</text>
  <text start="918.08" dur="6.42">were protesting because they didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="919.94" dur="6.81">austerity it&amp;#39;s starting to happen and</text>
  <text start="924.5" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s going to pick up pace and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="926.75" dur="3.72">going to get worse and worse and worse</text>
  <text start="927.92" dur="4.92">and what the Trump the Patriots have</text>
  <text start="930.47" dur="4.68">done right now is they&amp;#39;ve given the</text>
  <text start="932.84" dur="5.46">economy a little bit of stimulus to</text>
  <text start="935.15" dur="5.25">prepare for what is coming this system</text>
  <text start="938.3" dur="5.88">is going to transition to something else</text>
  <text start="940.4" dur="5.69">and we know that China and Russia most</text>
  <text start="944.18" dur="4.98">likely they&amp;#39;re behind the new system</text>
  <text start="946.09" dur="6.13">remember the belton road system this</text>
  <text start="949.16" dur="6.21">initiative will increase global trade by</text>
  <text start="952.22" dur="7.02">as much as 12% cutting trading costs by</text>
  <text start="955.37" dur="6.63">half for the countries involved trade</text>
  <text start="959.24" dur="5.01">between Asia and Europe not including</text>
  <text start="962" dur="5.43">trade between EU countries accounts for</text>
  <text start="964.25" dur="6.99">28% of the world trade so making those</text>
  <text start="967.43" dur="6.3">trade flows easier has a large potential</text>
  <text start="971.24" dur="4.34">impact countries in Eastern Europe and</text>
  <text start="973.73" dur="3.9">Central Asia are set to benefit the most</text>
  <text start="975.58" dur="5.44">explaining that the benefits will depend</text>
  <text start="977.63" dur="5.06">on where trade costs fall so if we</text>
  <text start="981.02" dur="4.46">really think about this</text>
  <text start="982.69" dur="5.639">making trade flow easier cutting the</text>
  <text start="985.48" dur="4.44">costs it&amp;#39;s going to benefit all these</text>
  <text start="988.329" dur="4.411">nations and all these other countries</text>
  <text start="989.92" dur="7.38">that jump on board they&amp;#39;re gonna get the</text>
  <text start="992.74" dur="6.269">benefit also and we know that the United</text>
  <text start="997.3" dur="3.63">States is going to need a new method of</text>
  <text start="999.009" dur="4.741">trade the old method of trade with</text>
  <text start="1000.93" dur="5.639">everyone holding the dollar and you know</text>
  <text start="1003.75" dur="4.92">purchasing our goods it doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="1006.569" dur="3.96">anymore actually we&amp;#39;re not manufacturing</text>
  <text start="1008.67" dur="4.349">we have a small manufacturing base</text>
  <text start="1010.529" dur="5.43">compared to China that this can&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="1013.019" dur="5.94">anymore this is why we need different</text>
  <text start="1015.959" dur="6.961">trade deals the globalist trading system</text>
  <text start="1018.959" dur="6.96">no longer exists that&amp;#39;s out the window</text>
  <text start="1022.92" dur="5.759">right now I mean yes come things change</text>
  <text start="1025.919" dur="5.101">of course they can but right now we are</text>
  <text start="1028.679" dur="4.89">on a path where the global trading</text>
  <text start="1031.02" dur="4.319">system is thrown out the window we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1033.569" dur="4.26">moving in a completely different</text>
  <text start="1035.339" dur="5.641">direction because when this economy</text>
  <text start="1037.829" dur="5.88">fails we&amp;#39;re going to need a new trading</text>
  <text start="1040.98" dur="4.41">system and there are countries that are</text>
  <text start="1043.709" dur="4.62">continually joining the one belt one</text>
  <text start="1045.39" dur="4.95">road the Silk Road and more and more</text>
  <text start="1048.329" dur="3.781">countries are looking at this saying yes</text>
  <text start="1050.34" dur="3.36">we need to be a part of this anything</text>
  <text start="1052.11" dur="3.99">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is the</text>
  <text start="1053.7" dur="4.89">United States will be a part of this new</text>
  <text start="1056.1" dur="4.38">trading system plus with all the</text>
  <text start="1058.59" dur="5.25">different bilateral trades instead of</text>
  <text start="1060.48" dur="5.1">having a global trading system so if one</text>
  <text start="1063.84" dur="4.5">country&amp;#39;s trading system is in dispute</text>
  <text start="1065.58" dur="5.37">the others aren&amp;#39;t affected and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1068.34" dur="4.11">not one centralized system controlling</text>
  <text start="1070.95" dur="3.839">it that&amp;#39;s the way the central bankers</text>
  <text start="1072.45" dur="4.8">wanted and all of this has to be done</text>
  <text start="1074.789" dur="6.63">before the system crashes this is why</text>
  <text start="1077.25" dur="6.48">the US has been put on stimulus for a</text>
  <text start="1081.419" dur="5.101">little bit longer to get everything set</text>
  <text start="1083.73" dur="4.14">up for this gigantic transition and</text>
  <text start="1086.52" dur="3.48">we&amp;#39;re gonna be transitioning away from</text>
  <text start="1087.87" dur="5.039">the US dollar into a different currency</text>
  <text start="1090" dur="5.039">most likely a crypto currency maybe at a</text>
  <text start="1092.909" dur="4.621">high level you have the petrol you won</text>
  <text start="1095.039" dur="3.781">or something else but at a lower level I</text>
  <text start="1097.53" dur="3.95">think the Polli but the people are going</text>
  <text start="1098.82" dur="5.19">to be using some form of cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="1101.48" dur="3.97">where the central bankers will not be</text>
  <text start="1104.01" dur="3.779">involved of course the central bankers</text>
  <text start="1105.45" dur="3.69">don&amp;#39;t want this they want a centralized</text>
  <text start="1107.789" dur="3.181">system where they control everything</text>
  <text start="1109.14" dur="3.899">because that&amp;#39;s how their system works</text>
  <text start="1110.97" dur="5.459">but I do believe that this is going to</text>
  <text start="1113.039" dur="6.181">be decentralized decentralized exchanges</text>
  <text start="1116.429" dur="4.86">and it&amp;#39;s gonna be free-flowing and a</text>
  <text start="1119.22" dur="3.87">truth machine throughout the world and</text>
  <text start="1121.289" dur="3.421">we are headed in this direction but</text>
  <text start="1123.09" dur="2.789">we&amp;#39;re gonna go through the bumps it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1124.71" dur="3.059">gonna be difficult for many people</text>
  <text start="1125.879" dur="2.221">people that haven&amp;#39;t been prepared for</text>
  <text start="1127.769" dur="2.04">this</text>
  <text start="1128.1" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re not gonna know what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1129.809" dur="3.6">just like in the 70s people didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1131.82" dur="3.209">what was going on all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="1133.409" dur="3.691">everything fell apart</text>
  <text start="1135.029" dur="3.9">couldn&amp;#39;t get fuel they were telling us</text>
  <text start="1137.1" dur="4.079">that you know it was gold speculators</text>
  <text start="1138.929" dur="3.931">and all the different stories they made</text>
  <text start="1141.179" dur="4.2">up and people were out of work</text>
  <text start="1142.86" dur="4.62">unemployment was very high and they were</text>
  <text start="1145.379" dur="6.061">adjusting to the new system but remember</text>
  <text start="1147.48" dur="6.12">that was a system we were on we were</text>
  <text start="1151.44" dur="4.739">coming off a stable system moving on to</text>
  <text start="1153.6" dur="5.789">a new system this time we&amp;#39;re moving from</text>
  <text start="1156.179" dur="4.771">this unstable system to a brand-new</text>
  <text start="1159.389" dur="4.441">system and were no longer the reserve</text>
  <text start="1160.95" dur="4.53">currency and this is why we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1163.83" dur="4.53">feel the pain this is why the transition</text>
  <text start="1165.48" dur="5.399">is gonna be difficult</text>
  <text start="1168.36" dur="5.939">for many people because they&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="1170.879" dur="6.15">prepared for it so get prepared because</text>
  <text start="1174.299" dur="4.651">the transition is coming listen everyone</text>
