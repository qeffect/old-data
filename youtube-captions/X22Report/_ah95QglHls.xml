  <text start="112.83" dur="5.49">at the blockchain and what is happening</text>
  <text start="114.93" dur="6.21">here is they&amp;#39;re preparing for the system</text>
  <text start="118.32" dur="8.37">to move away from the central banking</text>
  <text start="121.14" dur="7.349">system into a whole new realm and we can</text>
  <text start="126.69" dur="3.179">see that this is actually really</text>
  <text start="128.489" dur="3.75">happening even here in the United States</text>
  <text start="129.869" dur="6.961">there are certain states and counties</text>
  <text start="132.239" dur="7.011">that are allowing people to use crypto</text>
  <text start="136.83" dur="5.01">currencies to pay for their taxes</text>
  <text start="139.25" dur="5.44">corporations are looking to use the</text>

  <text start="151.86" dur="6.36">the banking institutions now again what</text>
  <text start="156.6" dur="5.15">we need to do is we need to make sure</text>
  <text start="158.22" dur="7.41">that the central bankers don&amp;#39;t try to</text>
  <text start="161.75" dur="7">capture this new system like they did</text>
  <text start="165.63" dur="5.07">with paper currency like they did with</text>
  <text start="168.75" dur="6.39">the paper currency that was backed by</text>
  <text start="170.7" dur="7.349">gold they do have the ability to</text>
  <text start="175.14" dur="7.02">convince governments through bribing</text>
  <text start="178.049" dur="6.961">them and other means to create laws to</text>
  <text start="182.16" dur="4.44">say hey you have to use our</text>
  <text start="185.01" dur="4.2">cryptocurrency but</text>
  <text start="186.6" dur="4.71">people on the other hand have the power</text>
  <text start="189.21" dur="3.45">and the strength and I&amp;#39;m not just</text>
  <text start="191.31" dur="2.31">talking to people about the people in</text>
  <text start="192.66" dur="2.58">the United States I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="193.62" dur="3.57">people around the world they have the</text>
  <text start="195.24" dur="4.5">power and the strength to say no we are</text>
  <text start="197.19" dur="6.71">not going to use that cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="199.74" dur="8.22">it&amp;#39;s that simple and once we do this</text>
  <text start="203.9" dur="6.73">once we as a people stand up to the</text>
  <text start="207.96" dur="5.88">central bank well it&amp;#39;s game over for</text>
  <text start="210.63" dur="7.62">them because we are transitioning into a</text>
  <text start="213.84" dur="7.08">new system and country&amp;#39;s businesses</text>
  <text start="218.25" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re all preparing for this and if</text>
  <text start="220.92" dur="3.27">you want to know more about crypto</text>
  <text start="222.84" dur="3.69">currencies you want to learn about them</text>
  <text start="224.19" dur="4.5">you can go to the x-22 report school</text>
  <text start="226.53" dur="4.05">comm you can take a look at the website</text>
  <text start="228.69" dur="3.69">you&amp;#39;ll see the school there&amp;#39;s also a</text>
  <text start="230.58" dur="5.1">trading room there and you can read all</text>
  <text start="232.38" dur="5.22">about it on the website now we see here</text>
  <text start="235.68" dur="3.36">in the United States everything is</text>
  <text start="237.6" dur="6.56">starting to break down very very quickly</text>
  <text start="239.04" dur="8.09">and we see that the housing rebound</text>
  <text start="244.16" dur="5.11">completely is dead in the water</text>
  <text start="247.13" dur="4.36">existing home sales new home sales</text>
  <text start="249.27" dur="5.01">pending home sales they&amp;#39;re all declining</text>
  <text start="251.49" dur="3.66">pending home sales in April they tumble</text>
  <text start="254.28" dur="3">by one point three percent</text>
  <text start="255.15" dur="4.38">month-on-month they missed their</text>
  <text start="257.28" dur="4.65">expectations of a four percent point</text>
  <text start="259.53" dur="5.76">four percent gained and they&amp;#39;re well</text>
  <text start="261.93" dur="5.79">below the analysts estimate now if we</text>
  <text start="265.29" dur="4.65">look around the country we can see</text>
  <text start="267.72" dur="4.8">signings they dropped in three of the</text>
  <text start="269.94" dur="5.13">four regions led by a three three point</text>
  <text start="272.52" dur="4.17">two percent decline in the Midwest fell</text>
  <text start="275.07" dur="4.59">one percent in the South Point four</text>
  <text start="276.69" dur="5.58">percent in the West and we see at this</text>
  <text start="279.66" dur="5.01">point that the Northeast is unchanged</text>
  <text start="282.27" dur="4.44">right now and pending home sales index</text>
  <text start="284.67" dur="3.9">for the West was the lowest since 2014</text>
  <text start="286.71" dur="5.13">now remember the interest rates are</text>
  <text start="288.57" dur="6.06">starting to inch up right now and we see</text>
  <text start="291.84" dur="7.32">that mortgage refinances their activity</text>
  <text start="294.63" dur="6.27">has plunged imploded to 18 year lows we</text>
  <text start="299.16" dur="4.95">see mortgage applications they decreased</text>
  <text start="300.9" dur="5.61">by 2.9 percent and this is something</text>
  <text start="304.11" dur="4.32">that we haven&amp;#39;t seen since the Great</text>
  <text start="306.51" dur="4.8">Recession actually we&amp;#39;re a little bit</text>
  <text start="308.43" dur="4.65">below that at this point and this is</text>
  <text start="311.31" dur="4.14">just going to accelerate it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="313.08" dur="5.01">get a lot worse as we move forward</text>
  <text start="315.45" dur="4.62">remember this is the popular time of</text>
  <text start="318.09" dur="5.82">year where in the</text>
  <text start="320.07" dur="6.03">families go out and they purchase homes</text>
  <text start="323.91" dur="4.62">because they want to be in their home</text>
  <text start="326.1" dur="4.17">before school starts they want to move</text>
  <text start="328.53" dur="3.33">during the summer because it&amp;#39;s warm you</text>
  <text start="330.27" dur="3.81">don&amp;#39;t have to worry about bad weather</text>
  <text start="331.86" dur="4.35">yes it might rain but you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="334.08" dur="4.26">worry about slow snow sleet and all the</text>
  <text start="336.21" dur="3.9">other stuff and a lot of people take</text>
  <text start="338.34" dur="3.84">vacation during this period of time and</text>
  <text start="340.11" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;ve seen this before we&amp;#39;ve seen it</text>
  <text start="342.18" dur="3.96">last year the year before that and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="343.89" dur="4.65">just getting worse every single year and</text>
  <text start="346.14" dur="4.92">there was a time where home builder</text>
  <text start="348.54" dur="4.14">stocks they were continually moving up</text>
  <text start="351.06" dur="3.57">because they weren&amp;#39;t really looking at</text>
  <text start="352.68" dur="4.77">anything they always had hope and now</text>
  <text start="354.63" dur="4.47">things have drastically changed it looks</text>
  <text start="357.45" dur="4.41">like they&amp;#39;re catching on to what is</text>
  <text start="359.1" dur="4.83">happening and home builder stocks well</text>
  <text start="361.86" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re starting to decline and they</text>
  <text start="363.93" dur="4.86">have been declining since the beginning</text>
  <text start="366.33" dur="6.42">of this year so we see that things are</text>
  <text start="368.79" dur="7.56">rapidly changing and it&amp;#39;s just gonna get</text>
  <text start="372.75" dur="6.6">worse as we move forward the savings</text>
  <text start="376.35" dur="6.09">rate right now has tumbled back to near</text>
  <text start="379.35" dur="5.13">lows and they&amp;#39;re saying that everyone is</text>
  <text start="382.44" dur="4.44">dipping into their savings they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="384.48" dur="5.19">there spending everyone is trying to</text>
  <text start="386.88" dur="4.29">survive right now and if their credit</text>
  <text start="389.67" dur="3.63">cards are maxed they&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="391.17" dur="4.62">dip into whatever savings they have to</text>
  <text start="393.3" dur="4.74">pay for what they need and also if you</text>
  <text start="395.79" dur="5.28">notice gasoline prices have been going</text>
  <text start="398.04" dur="6.75">up we know that food prices are inching</text>
  <text start="401.07" dur="6">up and this is costing more money and if</text>
  <text start="404.79" dur="4.2">it costs more money you need to find</text>
  <text start="407.07" dur="3.81">this money someplace and if your credit</text>
  <text start="408.99" dur="4.47">cards are maxed you need to go into</text>
  <text start="410.88" dur="5.61">savings this is not a very good sign</text>
  <text start="413.46" dur="7.89">right now personal savings they are back</text>
  <text start="416.49" dur="8.01">to the levels of around 2007 and this is</text>
  <text start="421.35" dur="7.47">absolutely awful because we&amp;#39;ve gone</text>
  <text start="424.5" dur="7.11">nowhere in nine years this system that</text>
  <text start="428.82" dur="5.34">the central bankers have created it is</text>
  <text start="431.61" dur="7.32">not helping the everyday person and this</text>
  <text start="434.16" dur="7.56">is why the Patriots Trump have just poor</text>
  <text start="438.93" dur="7.5">just pushed forward the agenda to crash</text>
  <text start="441.72" dur="6.27">the economy now we could see that Trump</text>
  <text start="446.43" dur="5.16">has been talking about tariffs for quite</text>
  <text start="447.99" dur="5.82">a while and he implemented these tariffs</text>
  <text start="451.59" dur="6.42">with China Europe can</text>
  <text start="453.81" dur="7.59">and Mexico all at the same time not just</text>
  <text start="458.01" dur="5.52">with China but everyone now what is this</text>
  <text start="461.4" dur="4.32">going to do well most likely it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="463.53" dur="6.51">to start trade wars the other thing that</text>
  <text start="465.72" dur="9.6">it does is it automatically kills TTIP</text>
  <text start="470.04" dur="7.86">and NAFTA at the same time and we see</text>
  <text start="475.32" dur="4.8">that the economy is already struggling</text>
  <text start="477.9" dur="5.7">how do you push the economy over the</text>
  <text start="480.12" dur="9.12">edge well you do exactly what is being</text>
  <text start="483.6" dur="8.64">done and you wait and you see where is</text>
  <text start="489.24" dur="6.66">going to be the first domino that falls</text>
  <text start="492.24" dur="5.4">and then we look at Deutsche Bank now</text>
  <text start="495.9" dur="3.45">remember the Italian banks were having</text>
  <text start="497.64" dur="4.29">problems we know Deutsche Bank they were</text>
  <text start="499.35" dur="5.16">laying off you know 10,000 people one</text>
  <text start="501.93" dur="4.049">out of 10 people most likely it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="504.51" dur="4.35">be a lot more they were preparing for</text>
  <text start="505.979" dur="5.491">this they&amp;#39;re restructuring because they</text>
  <text start="508.86" dur="4.619">knew what was happening and we see right</text>
  <text start="511.47" dur="4.29">now that it&amp;#39;s just getting worse and</text>
  <text start="513.479" dur="4.201">worse for Deutsche Bank it looks like</text>
  <text start="515.76" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;re entering a Lehman type of</text>
  <text start="517.68" dur="5.34">situation right now and the Federal</text>
  <text start="520.02" dur="7.26">Reserve they have a secret rating system</text>
  <text start="523.02" dur="7.41">known as camels and what they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="527.28" dur="6.72">here is they moved which a bank into the</text>
  <text start="530.43" dur="5.31">troubled condition the trouble condition</text>
  <text start="534" dur="4.17">status one of the lowest designations</text>
  <text start="535.74" dur="4.68">employed by the Fed has influenced moves</text>
  <text start="538.17" dur="4.89">by the bank to reduce risk-taking in</text>
  <text start="540.42" dur="6.27">areas like trading and lending to</text>
  <text start="543.06" dur="7.05">customers and what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is</text>
  <text start="546.69" dur="5.91">that Deutsche Bank is in trouble now the</text>
  <text start="550.11" dur="5.04">other rating agencies like Moody&amp;#39;s S&amp;amp;P</text>
  <text start="552.6" dur="4.77">Fitch and the rest most likely are going</text>
  <text start="555.15" dur="5.07">to downgrade them and this is going to</text>
  <text start="557.37" dur="5.219">start a chain reaction this might be the</text>
  <text start="560.22" dur="5.07">beginning of the end and it might spread</text>
  <text start="562.589" dur="3.871">through all the European banks and into</text>
  <text start="565.29" dur="5.25">the United States</text>
  <text start="566.46" dur="6.69">now the secret rating system that the</text>
  <text start="570.54" dur="6.39">Fed uses which is known as camels this</text>
  <text start="573.15" dur="7.11">stands for capital adequacy asset</text>
  <text start="576.93" dur="8.93">quality management earnings liquidity</text>
  <text start="580.26" dur="5.6">and sensitivity to market risks and</text>
  <text start="585.92" dur="4.08">banks top-line rating from one to five</text>
  <text start="588.139" dur="4.89">takes into account all these categories</text>
  <text start="590" dur="4.47">the best rating is one trouble banks are</text>
  <text start="593.029" dur="5.81">rated either between a four and a five</text>
  <text start="594.47" dur="8">and these scores are not made public and</text>
  <text start="598.839" dur="7.031">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="602.47" dur="7.119">everything has been put into motion to</text>
  <text start="605.87" dur="7.8">shut down the system it looks like it is</text>
  <text start="609.589" dur="7.981">time and the entire economic system is</text>
  <text start="613.67" dur="6.27">going to rapidly deteriorate as we move</text>
  <text start="617.57" dur="7.769">throughout this summer we already see</text>
  <text start="619.94" dur="9.18">Iran well they made a deal with India</text>
  <text start="625.339" dur="6.031">and they&amp;#39;re gonna sell their oil not</text>
  <text start="629.12" dur="6.659">using the dollar they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="631.37" dur="6.779">using rupees so they&amp;#39;re bypassing the</text>
  <text start="635.779" dur="4.891">dollar and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="638.149" dur="4.201">China Russia Iran and the rest of the</text>
  <text start="640.67" dur="5.31">Middle Eastern countries they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="642.35" dur="7.65">going to be using other currencies and</text>
  <text start="645.98" dur="7.859">they&amp;#39;re moving away from the dollar this</text>
  <text start="650" dur="6.899">is the endgame here and again how do you</text>
  <text start="653.839" dur="7.321">cut off the funding to the deep state</text>
  <text start="656.899" dur="7.651">the rogue intelligence and the rest you</text>
  <text start="661.16" dur="6.33">shut down their source of funding and</text>
  <text start="664.55" dur="5.399">where does that come from the central</text>
  <text start="667.49" dur="4.2">banking system and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="669.949" dur="6.481">seeing happen right in front of our</text>
  <text start="671.69" dur="7.589">faces right now and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="676.43" dur="6.45">Patriots decided to make the push now</text>
  <text start="679.279" dur="6.93">and they&amp;#39;re pushing it really hard to</text>
  <text start="682.88" dur="7.59">bring it down and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="686.209" dur="5.401">gonna do even more to take this economy</text>
  <text start="690.47" dur="4.32">and push it over the edge you have to</text>
  <text start="691.61" dur="5.28">remember this economy is not a people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="694.79" dur="3.93">economy we didn&amp;#39;t design this economy</text>
  <text start="696.89" dur="6.54">this is not the economy that we all</text>
  <text start="698.72" dur="7.859">voted for this was forced upon us the</text>
  <text start="703.43" dur="7.92">central banking system forced their way</text>
  <text start="706.579" dur="6.391">their way into government made them pass</text>
  <text start="711.35" dur="6.359">laws which we don&amp;#39;t even know it was</text>
  <text start="712.97" dur="6.94">actually ratified and told the people</text>
  <text start="717.709" dur="5.921">this is what you need to</text>
  <text start="719.91" dur="4.89">use and the people went along with it</text>
  <text start="723.63" dur="2.28">now in the beginning they said they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="724.8" dur="2.94">not gonna attacks anyone there&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="725.91" dur="3.81">be no income tax but of course there had</text>
  <text start="727.74" dur="4.17">to be income tax because they were</text>
  <text start="729.72" dur="4.41">loaning the money to the government who</text>
  <text start="731.91" dur="4.38">was gonna pay for the interest and this</text>
