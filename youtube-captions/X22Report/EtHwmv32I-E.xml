  <text start="29.97" dur="5.13">name is dave and this is episode 340 and</text>
  <text start="32.279" dur="4.681">today&amp;#39;s date is april 14 2014 and the</text>
  <text start="35.1" dur="4.26">title of this episode is as the conflict</text>
  <text start="36.96" dur="5.25">in Ukraine escalates a false flag event</text>
  <text start="39.36" dur="5.21">looms and we can see the crisis in</text>
  <text start="42.21" dur="4.5">Ukraine is getting worse as we</text>
  <text start="44.57" dur="5.35">continually go on there are more</text>
  <text start="46.71" dur="5.37">protests in ukraine pro-russian people</text>
  <text start="49.92" dur="4.5">are taking over buildings all of them</text>
  <text start="52.08" dur="4.77">want a referendum they don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="54.42" dur="4.98">part of ukraine and of course ukraine</text>
  <text start="56.85" dur="5.19">cannot let them go so they&amp;#39;ve signed a</text>
  <text start="59.4" dur="5.759">bill making all these people terrorists</text>
  <text start="62.04" dur="4.89">now just like the US government central</text>
  <text start="65.159" dur="3.991">bankers once they have a puppet regime</text>
  <text start="66.93" dur="4.259">in place they do this all over the place</text>
  <text start="69.15" dur="3.6">in the Middle East they have all the</text>
  <text start="71.189" dur="3.481">puppet regimes in place and all those</text>
  <text start="72.75" dur="4.079">people who want their country back they</text>
  <text start="74.67" dur="4.589">are terrorists actually here in America</text>
  <text start="76.829" dur="4.201">we actually saw the same exact thing and</text>
  <text start="79.259" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s still going on this has not ended</text>
  <text start="81.03" dur="6.18">with clive in bundy they labeled him as</text>
  <text start="84.929" dur="4.921">a domestic terrorist because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="87.21" dur="4.799">criticizing talking out against the</text>
  <text start="89.85" dur="4.92">government so now he is labeled as a</text>
  <text start="92.009" dur="6.11">domestic terrorist and we can see this</text>
  <text start="94.77" dur="5.879">is how they play this is their same</text>
  <text start="98.119" dur="4.871">strategy that they use everywhere they</text>
  <text start="100.649" dur="3.631">take it from the same exact playbook and</text>
  <text start="102.99" dur="4.25">there&amp;#39;s no difference so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="104.28" dur="6.329">seeing all across the world right now is</text>
  <text start="107.24" dur="5.53">they are losing control there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="110.609" dur="4.89">trying to maintain control here in the</text>
  <text start="112.77" dur="6.36">states and anyone that gets in their way</text>
  <text start="115.499" dur="6.93">you will be labeled a domestic terrorist</text>
  <text start="119.13" dur="5.279">now of course we understand that as all</text>
  <text start="122.429" dur="4.021">this continually falls apart and the</text>
  <text start="124.409" dur="4.35">economy completely implodes on itself</text>
  <text start="126.45" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re going to need some type of an</text>
  <text start="128.759" dur="6.001">event to get them out of this situation</text>
  <text start="131.31" dur="5.039">and to do this they will of course use a</text>
  <text start="134.76" dur="3.24">false flag event they&amp;#39;ve been warning</text>
  <text start="136.349" dur="3.761">about this all along and they</text>
  <text start="138" dur="4.21">continually give us warnings about</text>
  <text start="140.11" dur="5.97">Power Grid failure is about cyber</text>
  <text start="142.21" dur="7.23">attacks about al-qaeda about lone wolves</text>
  <text start="146.08" dur="7.11">and this is why we expect some type of</text>
  <text start="149.44" dur="6.18">an event to occur to take all eyes off</text>
  <text start="153.19" dur="4.86">of the central banker and the US</text>
  <text start="155.62" dur="5.85">government and put it on another country</text>
  <text start="158.05" dur="6.06">to begin this war and we can see this</text>
  <text start="161.47" dur="4.56">happening right now and every day that</text>
  <text start="164.11" dur="4.47">we go through this we see more and more</text>
  <text start="166.03" dur="5.16">evidence of this we see more of what</text>
  <text start="168.58" dur="5.129">they&amp;#39;re trying to do and we can see and</text>
  <text start="171.19" dur="4.8">we look at all the indicators how we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="173.709" dur="5.941">moving down this path where they want us</text>
  <text start="175.99" dur="5.66">to go to bring about this war now let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="179.65" dur="4.98">get into the economic collapse news now</text>
  <text start="181.65" dur="5.38">we understand in Greece that people are</text>
  <text start="184.63" dur="4.65">having a very rough time they cannot</text>
  <text start="187.03" dur="4.47">find work and right now about seventy</text>
  <text start="189.28" dur="4.59">two percent of Greeks need more work</text>
  <text start="191.5" dur="4.14">well that&amp;#39;s not really surprising a lot</text>
  <text start="193.87" dur="3.81">of a more part-time they wish they could</text>
  <text start="195.64" dur="3.39">take on more hours to make more money</text>
  <text start="197.68" dur="3.69">because they&amp;#39;re just making a little bit</text>
  <text start="199.03" dur="4.709">right now and I&amp;#39;m sure a lot of people</text>
  <text start="201.37" dur="4.77">in other countries feel the same way and</text>
  <text start="203.739" dur="3.451">especially here in the United States you</text>
  <text start="206.14" dur="3.08">know with those people who have been</text>
  <text start="207.19" dur="5.01">working in full-time jobs that have a</text>
  <text start="209.22" dur="4.96">part time job or two part-time jobs now</text>
  <text start="212.2" dur="4.259">wish they had something better where</text>
  <text start="214.18" dur="3.66">they can bring in more money and we are</text>
  <text start="216.459" dur="2.871">seeing this pretty much all over but</text>
  <text start="217.84" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t worry the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="219.33" dur="6.4">spinnin the news today letting us know</text>
  <text start="222.31" dur="6.45">that retail sales are surging by most in</text>
  <text start="225.73" dur="6.569">18 months and of course the entire</text>
  <text start="228.76" dur="6.78">retail sales is made up of auto sales</text>
  <text start="232.299" dur="5.851">and right now auto sales jumped about</text>
  <text start="235.54" dur="4.979">three-point-four percent and how did</text>
  <text start="238.15" dur="4.53">they get these old sales up it&amp;#39;s amazing</text>
  <text start="240.519" dur="3.631">because you know the manufacturers have</text>
  <text start="242.68" dur="4.83">been channel stuffing the dealer lots</text>
  <text start="244.15" dur="5.64">and then to get rid of the cars they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="247.51" dur="4.56">giving them discounts they&amp;#39;re giving</text>
  <text start="249.79" dur="5.58">loans to subprime people and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="252.07" dur="5.669">doing other type of maneuvers to get</text>
  <text start="255.37" dur="5.459">these cars moving and we&amp;#39;ll talk about</text>
  <text start="257.739" dur="5.341">that a little bit in a little bit but</text>
  <text start="260.829" dur="4.801">right now what we&amp;#39;re seeing in actual</text>
  <text start="263.08" dur="5.519">retailers that is down one-point-six</text>
  <text start="265.63" dur="5.37">percent that has to do with electronics</text>
  <text start="268.599" dur="5.431">clothing and things like that so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="271" dur="4.98">actually declining automobile sales</text>
  <text start="274.03" dur="4.41">kind of push this up and everyone&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="275.98" dur="4.89">oh my god retails rebounding it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="278.44" dur="4.32">recovering it&amp;#39;s doing fantastic but how</text>
  <text start="280.87" dur="5.4">can it be because we have to use common</text>
  <text start="282.76" dur="6.99">sense here again we&amp;#39;re seeing retail</text>
  <text start="286.27" dur="7.17">stores closing I mean just let was a</text>
  <text start="289.75" dur="6.93">Saturday or Friday coldwater creek those</text>
  <text start="293.44" dur="6.33">stores completely gone 6,000 people out</text>
  <text start="296.68" dur="5.64">of work and they&amp;#39;re bankrupt completely</text>
  <text start="299.77" dur="5.04">gone and we&amp;#39;ve been talking about stores</text>
  <text start="302.32" dur="5.25">closing store closing so what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="304.81" dur="5.46">trying to convince us of really doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="307.57" dur="5.04">make sense and what is happening now is</text>
  <text start="310.27" dur="5.61">and this is from automotive news reports</text>
  <text start="312.61" dur="5.91">a growing number of consumers are owing</text>
  <text start="315.88" dur="4.29">more on their trade ins than their</text>
  <text start="318.52" dur="3.75">vehicles are actually worth an</text>
  <text start="320.17" dur="4.53">automotive news reports twenty-two</text>
  <text start="322.27" dur="6.09">percent of trade ins were upside down</text>
  <text start="324.7" dur="7.2">however by q1 of 2014 the percentage</text>
  <text start="328.36" dur="5.01">reached 27.3 what these people have been</text>
  <text start="331.9" dur="4.65">doing is they&amp;#39;ve been trading in their</text>
  <text start="333.37" dur="6.08">cars stuffing their payments into</text>
  <text start="336.55" dur="7.8">another car and taking out loans between</text>
  <text start="339.45" dur="6.79">73 and 84 months because they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="344.35" dur="4.53">afford the car they&amp;#39;re stuffing it into</text>
  <text start="346.24" dur="5.97">another car and this is how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="348.88" dur="6.66">trying to pump up the auto industry now</text>
  <text start="352.21" dur="5.4">we saw this back in 2007-2008 where they</text>
  <text start="355.54" dur="4.17">were giving discounts where they were</text>
  <text start="357.61" dur="3.87">doing everything possible subprime and</text>
  <text start="359.71" dur="3.57">what happened to you or to the</text>
  <text start="361.48" dur="4.26">Automobile Manufacturers at that time</text>
  <text start="363.28" dur="5.7">they imploded on themselves they needed</text>
  <text start="365.74" dur="5.88">a bailout because they had so much debt</text>
  <text start="368.98" dur="4.14">by giving all these discounts that it</text>
  <text start="371.62" dur="3.06">really didn&amp;#39;t work and we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="373.12" dur="3.9">same thing right now but we&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="374.68" dur="6.18">seeing an increase in subprime borrowing</text>
  <text start="377.02" dur="6.75">and this is allowing the automobile for</text>
  <text start="380.86" dur="6.09">temporarily to make it looks like</text>
  <text start="383.77" dur="6.24">they&amp;#39;re improving the entire retail</text>
  <text start="386.95" dur="6.39">market which they are not and you will</text>
  <text start="390.01" dur="6.48">see as we go along this year this cannot</text>
  <text start="393.34" dur="5.7">last ano falter off retail sales will</text>
  <text start="396.49" dur="5.25">continually slide more stores will close</text>
  <text start="399.04" dur="4.29">and then the news and I&amp;#39;ll have to spin</text>
  <text start="401.74" dur="2.55">it in another way who knows maybe</text>
  <text start="403.33" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;ll just change all the calculations</text>
  <text start="404.29" dur="3.18">like they do with everything else but we</text>
  <text start="406.6" dur="2.31">can see</text>
  <text start="407.47" dur="5.4">the direction that they&amp;#39;re moving in now</text>
  <text start="408.91" dur="6.15">Citigroup is cutting jobs and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="412.87" dur="4.77">cutting around two to three hundred jobs</text>
  <text start="415.06" dur="5.58">in its division handling stock and bond</text>
  <text start="417.64" dur="4.8">trades why I mean stocks they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="420.64" dur="3.69">fantastically well why would they cut</text>
  <text start="422.44" dur="4.44">people at this point and of course</text>
  <text start="424.33" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re cutting people and you&amp;#39;ll hear</text>
  <text start="426.88" dur="4.86">more and more of these cuts coming forth</text>
  <text start="429.58" dur="4.2">more of these financial firms are going</text>
  <text start="431.74" dur="4.38">to be cutting big numbers very soon and</text>
  <text start="433.78" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;re going to continually hear this now</text>
  <text start="436.12" dur="4.71">just like we talked about JP Morgan with</text>
  <text start="438.37" dur="6.24">their loan origination how it declined</text>
  <text start="440.83" dur="7.41">well city mortgage originations they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="444.61" dur="7.14">dropped to record lows it plunged 71</text>
  <text start="448.24" dur="7.62">percent in mortgage origination from a</text>
  <text start="451.75" dur="6.33">year ago now how is that possible think</text>
  <text start="455.86" dur="6.12">about this for a second the unemployment</text>
  <text start="458.08" dur="6.57">rate is going down last year at this</text>
  <text start="461.98" dur="4.77">time it was above eight percent now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="464.65" dur="4.11">at six point seven percent and of course</text>
  <text start="466.75" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re out there saying oh hiring it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="468.76" dur="3.36">and jobs it&amp;#39;s just going to be getting</text>
  <text start="470.44" dur="3.6">better in the unemployment rate it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="472.12" dur="4.02">going to you know continually go down</text>
  <text start="474.04" dur="4.44">well the reason why it&amp;#39;s happening is</text>
  <text start="476.14" dur="5.01">because these numbers are fake and</text>
  <text start="478.48" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re a complete illusion it makes no</text>
  <text start="481.15" dur="5.55">sense that retail is doing worse as</text>
  <text start="483.19" dur="6.84">unemployment is continually dropping the</text>
  <text start="486.7" dur="5.58">percentage of people unemployed it makes</text>
  <text start="490.03" dur="4.83">no sense and as more people get jobs</text>
  <text start="492.28" dur="4.17">more people are saving money more people</text>
  <text start="494.86" dur="3.75">should be buying houses more people</text>
  <text start="496.45" dur="5.52">should be buying more retail stores but</text>
  <text start="498.61" dur="5.43">we see the complete opposite and again I</text>
  <text start="501.97" dur="5.3">have to say going throughout this year</text>
  <text start="504.04" dur="6.57">starting in spring this is normally the</text>
  <text start="507.27" dur="5.05">good time in real estate it starts in</text>
  <text start="510.61" dur="3.96">spring goes through the first part of</text>
  <text start="512.32" dur="4.5">the summer and it&amp;#39;s really booming at</text>
  <text start="514.57" dur="5.519">this time and we are not seeing that</text>
  <text start="516.82" dur="6.36">whatsoever and these fake retail numbers</text>
  <text start="520.089" dur="6.031">by automobile sales pushing this up is</text>
  <text start="523.18" dur="5.28">going to slowly decline away and all of</text>
  <text start="526.12" dur="3.75">a sudden retail will be back where it</text>
  <text start="528.46" dur="4.14">started from it&amp;#39;s almost like when they</text>
  <text start="529.87" dur="4.98">say employments getting better and</text>
  <text start="532.6" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re talking about November December</text>
  <text start="534.85" dur="3.51">you know during the Christmas season</text>
  <text start="536.2" dur="3.48">where everyone gets that six-week part</text>
  <text start="538.36" dur="2.65">time job and they&amp;#39;re telling us that</text>
  <text start="539.68" dur="3.23">employment is is</text>
  <text start="541.01" dur="3.73">fantastic look how many people are</text>
  <text start="542.91" dur="3.45">getting employed but they never tell you</text>
  <text start="544.74" dur="3.36">it&amp;#39;s only for six weeks and then it</text>
  <text start="546.36" dur="7.349">completely disappears so these aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="548.1" dur="8.01">really long-standing sustain jobs at all</text>
  <text start="553.709" dur="3.811">they&amp;#39;re just completely temporary just</text>
  <text start="556.11" dur="2.76">like we&amp;#39;re seeing with everything else</text>
  <text start="557.52" dur="3.87">and then all of a sudden they go ahead</text>
  <text start="558.87" dur="5.07">maybe change the calculations to pretty</text>
  <text start="561.39" dur="4.44">much everything to prove that yes we are</text>
  <text start="563.94" dur="3.36">still in this recovery and they like to</text>
  <text start="565.83" dur="4.83">convince you that we&amp;#39;re in this recovery</text>
  <text start="567.3" dur="5.07">and again as I always say we do not need</text>
  <text start="570.66" dur="4.77">to be convinced that we&amp;#39;re in a recovery</text>
  <text start="572.37" dur="4.83">because if we were we would feel it we</text>
  <text start="575.43" dur="3.779">would be making more money we&amp;#39;d have a</text>
  <text start="577.2" dur="4.38">good job we wouldn&amp;#39;t have to worry about</text>
  <text start="579.209" dur="4.411">going out to stores and spendings more</text>
  <text start="581.58" dur="5.25">people spending at stores they would</text>
  <text start="583.62" dur="5.94">expand retail operations more people</text>
  <text start="586.83" dur="5.34">saving money you would see housing</text>
  <text start="589.56" dur="4.92">growing you see builders building you</text>
  <text start="592.17" dur="4.56">can see construction increasing but</text>
  <text start="594.48" dur="5.479">we&amp;#39;re seeing the actual opposite</text>
  <text start="596.73" dur="7.65">everything is contracting at this point</text>
  <text start="599.959" dur="8.291">now China and Russia now are pretty much</text>
  <text start="604.38" dur="5.579">buying huge copper mines China and</text>
  <text start="608.25" dur="4.8">Russia making huge investments in</text>
  <text start="609.959" dur="6.031">commodity miners Russia&amp;#39;s largest gold</text>
  <text start="613.05" dur="5.279">miner polyus gold is considering a</text>
  <text start="615.99" dur="6.21">complete on shoring of its activities</text>
  <text start="618.329" dur="7.351">and China is buying a huge Peruvian</text>
  <text start="622.2" dur="5.73">copper mine from Glencore the outcome</text>
  <text start="625.68" dur="5.19">would appear to enable both firms to do</text>
  <text start="627.93" dur="5.52">away with the US dollar but not having</text>
  <text start="630.87" dur="6.12">to buy this resource in the market just</text>
  <text start="633.45" dur="6.93">mine it so we can see they are doing</text>
  <text start="636.99" dur="5.82">everything they possibly can to get away</text>

  <text start="713.16" dur="4.35">to let this go especially with the</text>
  <text start="715.41" dur="4.56">government officials who are trying to</text>

  <text start="724.41" dur="5.49">that they backed off and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="727.14" dur="5.91">out there on the alternative media that</text>
  <text start="729.9" dur="5.75">hotels are being filled up it could be</text>
  <text start="733.05" dur="5.58">fit being filled up with DHS and ATF</text>
  <text start="735.65" dur="8.1">there was a phone call made to hotels</text>
  <text start="738.63" dur="7.53">asking if ATF is in the hotel and the</text>
  <text start="743.75" dur="5.14">hotel management who answered the phone</text>
  <text start="746.16" dur="5.07">just pretty much hung up on the person</text>
  <text start="748.89" dur="5.49">he tried again asked the same question</text>
  <text start="751.23" dur="7.08">he they hung up on him so this is very</text>
  <text start="754.38" dur="6.36">suspicious where a hotel management</text>
  <text start="758.31" dur="4.89">talking to a customer would just</text>
  <text start="760.74" dur="4.11">actually hang up or the only reason they</text>
  <text start="763.2" dur="4.02">would hang up is because they were</text>
  <text start="764.85" dur="6.24">instructed to do so to not get involved</text>
  <text start="767.22" dur="6.54">do not discuss it and just disconnect if</text>
  <text start="771.09" dur="5.58">these questions are asked and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="773.76" dur="5.04">very interesting and we&amp;#39;re seeing people</text>
  <text start="776.67" dur="4.62">have been reporting in that there are</text>
  <text start="778.8" dur="5.22">different government agencies still</text>
  <text start="781.29" dur="4.8">around the area there are about 200</text>
  <text start="784.02" dur="4.08">federal agents including snipers that</text>
  <text start="786.09" dur="5.25">really haven&amp;#39;t left the area they are</text>
  <text start="788.1" dur="5.73">still there but what&amp;#39;s important and I</text>
  <text start="791.34" dur="5.4">find very interesting is that the FAA</text>
  <text start="793.83" dur="4.89">instituted a no-fly zone over and around</text>
  <text start="796.74" dur="3.96">the Bundys property only hours before</text>
  <text start="798.72" dur="5.76">the BLM announced that would stand down</text>
  <text start="800.7" dur="4.949">but the FAA has not lifted the no-fly</text>
  <text start="804.48" dur="3.51">zone and</text>
  <text start="805.649" dur="6.331">it will remain in place until May</text>
  <text start="807.99" dur="6.81">eleventh so you can see they have</text>
  <text start="811.98" dur="4.62">another it&amp;#39;s about a month or so so you</text>
  <text start="814.8" dur="3.06">could what what I believe is happening</text>
  <text start="816.6" dur="2.849">and I think a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="817.86" dur="3.329">believing this too is that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="819.449" dur="3.39">waiting every waiting for all these</text>
  <text start="821.189" dur="4.02">people to disperse to get out of the</text>
  <text start="822.839" dur="5.581">area completely and then they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="825.209" dur="5.79">to come in with force into the area and</text>
  <text start="828.42" dur="4.44">try to start something with no one being</text>
  <text start="830.999" dur="4.051">around because I really didn&amp;#39;t expect I</text>
  <text start="832.86" dur="4.229">don&amp;#39;t think they expected the turn out</text>
  <text start="835.05" dur="6">that there was going to be in that area</text>
  <text start="837.089" dur="7.17">and I believe that they are definitely</text>
  <text start="841.05" dur="5.61">waiting they&amp;#39;re sitting back waiting for</text>
  <text start="844.259" dur="4.62">everyone to go home wait a couple of</text>
  <text start="846.66" dur="4.56">weeks one or two weeks and then all of a</text>
  <text start="848.879" dur="4.291">sudden make their move and there&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="851.22" dur="6.059">no one there too but no one there to</text>
  <text start="853.17" dur="7.469">protect the Bundys at that point okay</text>
  <text start="857.279" dur="5.04">now with Obamacare everyone pretty much</text>
  <text start="860.639" dur="3.781">knows how I feel about this and if</text>
  <text start="862.319" dur="4.231">you&amp;#39;re a new listener you can go to my</text>
  <text start="864.42" dur="4.32">other reports but Obamacare is not for</text>
  <text start="866.55" dur="4.769">the people and it looks like people are</text>
  <text start="868.74" dur="5.31">getting some sticker shock right now a</text>
  <text start="871.319" dur="5.161">new survey of health insurance brokers</text>
  <text start="874.05" dur="4.74">shows premiums in several states have</text>
  <text start="876.48" dur="4.609">increased more than fifty percent</text>
  <text start="878.79" dur="8.37">already so we can see what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="881.089" dur="9.34">with this was designed as a cash grab</text>
  <text start="887.16" dur="5.479">they wanted every single American to get</text>
  <text start="890.429" dur="4.5">on the exchanges to get health insurance</text>
  <text start="892.639" dur="4.54">because this health insurance package</text>
  <text start="894.929" dur="3.541">was intertwined with taxes you were</text>
  <text start="897.179" dur="3.241">never going to get any benefits out of</text>
  <text start="898.47" dur="6.239">this health insurance unless you were</text>
  <text start="900.42" dur="6.899">completely a sick in the hospital and</text>
  <text start="904.709" dur="4.261">you pay your deductible first then you</text>
  <text start="907.319" dur="4.651">would get some benefit from the health</text>
  <text start="908.97" dur="6.27">insurance but in everyday life you going</text>
  <text start="911.97" dur="6.419">to the doctor for a cold flu or some</text>
  <text start="915.24" dur="5.099">type of injury you will not meet that</text>
  <text start="918.389" dur="4.021">that&amp;#39;s but at least most people will not</text>
  <text start="920.339" dur="4.141">meet their deductible and they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="922.41" dur="4.95">paying most of their medical expenses at</text>
  <text start="924.48" dur="5.76">a pocket puss they&amp;#39;ll be playing the</text>
  <text start="927.36" dur="5.43">paying the premium on the health</text>
  <text start="930.24" dur="5.37">insurance so you would never ever pretty</text>
  <text start="932.79" dur="6.149">much get any type of benefit from this</text>
  <text start="935.61" dur="3.81">but intertwined in all this is money for</text>
  <text start="938.939" dur="2.221">the insurer</text>
  <text start="939.42" dur="4.32">companies because they just make a huge</text>
  <text start="941.16" dur="4.59">profit on all this and the government</text>
  <text start="943.74" dur="4.17">would get their tax revenue that they</text>
  <text start="945.75" dur="4.89">wanted so badly and this is why they put</text>
  <text start="947.91" dur="5.25">a penalty on businesses and people if</text>
  <text start="950.64" dur="4.77">you do not take the health insurance you</text>
  <text start="953.16" dur="4.68">are still taxed because they wanted to</text>
  <text start="955.41" dur="4.71">get the money either way and the</text>
  <text start="957.84" dur="5.64">insurance companies wanted some type of</text>
  <text start="960.12" dur="5.91">guarantee that all people would be all</text>
  <text start="963.48" dur="4.08">in on this and the government said well</text>
  <text start="966.03" dur="4.62">will penalize them if they don&amp;#39;t go in</text>
  <text start="967.56" dur="4.5">and this is why this occurred because if</text>
  <text start="970.65" dur="3.9">you weren&amp;#39;t penalized you&amp;#39;d be like</text>
  <text start="972.06" dur="4.92">forget it I don&amp;#39;t want it and what would</text>
  <text start="974.55" dur="4.47">be the point at that time and again you</text>
  <text start="976.98" dur="4.17">have to remember the Obamacare the</text>
  <text start="979.02" dur="4.35">Affordable Care Act has a provision in</text>
  <text start="981.15" dur="5.25">there where there&amp;#39;s a bailout clause</text>
  <text start="983.37" dur="5.19">that helps the insurance companies just</text>
  <text start="986.4" dur="4.05">in case the people decided they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="988.56" dur="3.72">want this insurance and the insurance</text>
  <text start="990.45" dur="2.85">companies weren&amp;#39;t making the profits</text>
  <text start="992.28" dur="3.6">they thought they were going to make</text>
  <text start="993.3" dur="4.68">there is a bailout clause where they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="995.88" dur="4.44">build the government will make up the</text>
  <text start="997.98" dur="4.56">difference for the insurance companies</text>
  <text start="1000.32" dur="4.02">now we understand that Obamacare is not</text>
  <text start="1002.54" dur="3.21">doing well they&amp;#39;re not bringing in the</text>
  <text start="1004.34" dur="3.48">revenue they thought even though they</text>
  <text start="1005.75" dur="3.93">told us that was 7.4 million now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1007.82" dur="4.62">starting to see the numbers are really</text>
  <text start="1009.68" dur="4.95">around 1.5 million all the way up to 3</text>
  <text start="1012.44" dur="4.5">million and it&amp;#39;s dropping because people</text>
  <text start="1014.63" dur="5.16">are getting the bills they&amp;#39;re not paying</text>
  <text start="1016.94" dur="5.16">them they&amp;#39;re way too high and you know</text>
  <text start="1019.79" dur="6.24">they&amp;#39;re saying you know what right now</text>
  <text start="1022.1" dur="6.9">I&amp;#39;m out I&amp;#39;ll just pay the $95 or</text>
  <text start="1026.03" dur="4.65">whatever it is for the first year and or</text>
  <text start="1029" dur="4.71">the one percent or whatever the</text>
  <text start="1030.68" dur="4.59">percentage is that for Obamacare and</text>
  <text start="1033.71" dur="3.81">I&amp;#39;ll just do that at this time instead</text>
  <text start="1035.27" dur="4.74">of paying you know four five six hundred</text>
  <text start="1037.52" dur="5.13">dollars a month and since this is</text>
  <text start="1040.01" dur="3.99">happening what they&amp;#39;re going to do and</text>
  <text start="1042.65" dur="3.93">this is why they&amp;#39;ve been using climate</text>

  <text start="1851.22" dur="4.17">are giving money outside of the United</text>
  <text start="1853.26" dur="3.66">States because it doesn&amp;#39;t pay to put it</text>
  <text start="1855.39" dur="4.2">back into United States when you can</text>
  <text start="1856.92" dur="6.09">bring it to another country and spread</text>
  <text start="1859.59" dur="7.77">the dead out further and this is what</text>
  <text start="1863.01" dur="6.24">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now now we&amp;#39;ve there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1867.36" dur="3.99">a report out there saying and it seems</text>
  <text start="1869.25" dur="5.13">like it&amp;#39;s confirmed that the CIA</text>
  <text start="1871.35" dur="5.76">director visited Ukraine which</text>
  <text start="1874.38" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re most likely setting up for</text>
  <text start="1877.11" dur="3.81">something to happen and on Monday</text>
  <text start="1879.21" dur="4.32">afternoon White House spokesman Jay</text>
  <text start="1880.92" dur="4.83">Carney confirmed that CI director John</text>
  <text start="1883.53" dur="4.05">Brennan visited Ukraine capital Kiev</text>
  <text start="1885.75" dur="4.44">over the weekend and met with high</text>
  <text start="1887.58" dur="4.35">ranked Ukrainian officials now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1890.19" dur="4.38">probably out there because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1891.93" dur="5.46">having lots of problems keeping control</text>
  <text start="1894.57" dur="5.25">of the people in Ukraine a lot of them</text>
  <text start="1897.39" dur="5.18">have taken over government buildings</text>
  <text start="1899.82" dur="6.36">police stations they want a referendum</text>
  <text start="1902.57" dur="5.77">to completely secede from Ukraine they</text>
  <text start="1906.18" dur="3.96">want to be independent and right now the</text>
  <text start="1908.34" dur="3.69">central bankers and the puppet</text>
  <text start="1910.14" dur="4.05">government of Ukraine they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="1912.03" dur="5.07">losing control right now so they are</text>
  <text start="1914.19" dur="5.25">making preparations to push this forward</text>
  <text start="1917.1" dur="3.99">and when I say this they&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="1919.44" dur="4.08">going to end up coming down hard on</text>
  <text start="1921.09" dur="4.25">these people and of course the acting</text>
  <text start="1923.52" dur="4.89">president signs to create to start</text>
  <text start="1925.34" dur="4.99">anti-terrorist operations in eastern</text>
  <text start="1928.41" dur="3.57">Ukraine of course they are terrorists</text>
  <text start="1930.33" dur="3.06">because they want freedom and democracy</text>
  <text start="1931.98" dur="3.63">they don&amp;#39;t want to be part of this</text>
  <text start="1933.39" dur="3.96">puppet government and again we have to</text>
  <text start="1935.61" dur="3.48">go pack when the opposition was doing</text>
  <text start="1937.35" dur="4.14">the same exact thing but again they were</text>
  <text start="1939.09" dur="4.65">backed by United States and the EU to</text>
  <text start="1941.49" dur="3.72">overthrow the existing government now</text>
  <text start="1943.74" dur="3.3">they have the puppet government in there</text>
  <text start="1945.21" dur="3.42">that people have no rights they</text>
  <text start="1947.04" dur="3.6">shouldn&amp;#39;t have freedom they shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1948.63" dur="4.14">have democracy actually they are now</text>
  <text start="1950.64" dur="3.66">terrorists just like everyone else you</text>
  <text start="1952.77" dur="5.87">criticize now the puppet government of</text>
  <text start="1954.3" dur="7.53">United States you are now a terrorist</text>
  <text start="1958.64" dur="5.41">now there is a report out there that you</text>
  <text start="1961.83" dur="4.08">know during their drills and what was</text>
  <text start="1964.05" dur="5.1">going on in the black sea with the USS</text>
  <text start="1965.91" dur="5.97">Donald cook a Russian fighter jet flew</text>
  <text start="1969.15" dur="4.44">very close to the destroyer and you know</text>
  <text start="1971.88" dur="3.69">of course the Pentagon&amp;#39;s out there going</text>
  <text start="1973.59" dur="6.18">oh my God look at this but we have to</text>
  <text start="1975.57" dur="7.95">remember if Russia or China had a</text>
  <text start="1979.77" dur="6.39">destroyer in the Gulf of Mexico United</text>
  <text start="1983.52" dur="5.1">States would do the exact same thing</text>
  <text start="1986.16" dur="4.53">they would fly jets over the ships to</text>
  <text start="1988.62" dur="4.8">see what was going on and this would be</text>
  <text start="1990.69" dur="4.98">with any other nation and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1993.42" dur="5.49">to make it a big deal that and again</text>
  <text start="1995.67" dur="7.61">this jet was unarmed but if you&amp;#39;re if</text>
  <text start="1998.91" dur="8.649">you have a war vessel next to a country</text>
  <text start="2003.28" dur="7.07">that country is going to check it out</text>
  <text start="2007.559" dur="5.48">we had ships off the coast off the east</text>
  <text start="2010.35" dur="6.27">coast off the west coast or in the Gulf</text>
  <text start="2013.039" dur="6.85">if the UK if China or Russia was around</text>
  <text start="2016.62" dur="5.34">the UK you bet they&amp;#39;re going to fly jets</text>
  <text start="2019.889" dur="5.551">send ships they&amp;#39;re gonna see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2021.96" dur="7.829">going on this is normal and again they</text>
  <text start="2025.44" dur="6.359">flew a non armed jet over and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2029.789" dur="3.63">trying to make this into a big deal that</text>
  <text start="2031.799" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re trying to start something just</text>
  <text start="2033.419" dur="4.08">like they&amp;#39;re building up troops alone</text>
  <text start="2035.309" dur="4.71">the Ukraine Russian border they&amp;#39;re ready</text>
  <text start="2037.499" dur="4.38">to invade Ukraine they&amp;#39;re coming in any</text>
  <text start="2040.019" dur="3.421">day and of course this never happens it</text>
  <text start="2041.879" dur="3.481">reminds me of Iran where they keep</text>
  <text start="2043.44" dur="4.439">saying they&amp;#39;re three to five months out</text>
  <text start="2045.36" dur="5.549">with the nuclear weapon and they said</text>
  <text start="2047.879" dur="5.901">this for what 31 32 years now and it has</text>
  <text start="2050.909" dur="8.49">never ever happened because it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="2053.78" dur="9.22">propaganda now since the CIA director</text>
  <text start="2059.399" dur="6.091">was out in Ukraine talking about who</text>
  <text start="2063" dur="5.25">knows what most likely to bring in</text>
  <text start="2065.49" dur="5.579">troops and of course you know John Kerry</text>
  <text start="2068.25" dur="5.31">is spilling the beans saying yes us is</text>
  <text start="2071.069" dur="4.621">considering offering military help to</text>
  <text start="2073.56" dur="4.109">Ukraine at this time an adviser to</text>
  <text start="2075.69" dur="3.959">secretary of state john kerry said</text>
  <text start="2077.669" dur="3.841">monday that the united states may decide</text>
  <text start="2079.649" dur="4.47">to send arms to eastern Ukraine as</text>
  <text start="2081.51" dur="4.379">tensions continue to worsen there</text>
  <text start="2084.119" dur="3.99">between pro-russian protesters and</text>
  <text start="2085.889" dur="4.561">supporters of the country&amp;#39;s interim</text>
  <text start="2088.109" dur="7.651">government I&amp;#39;m going to tell you right</text>
  <text start="2090.45" dur="8.19">now the military help is already there</text>
  <text start="2095.76" dur="5.819">or on its way and they are already</text>
  <text start="2098.64" dur="5.939">bringing it in they&amp;#39;re already getting</text>
  <text start="2101.579" dur="5.641">ready to do something and this is why</text>
  <text start="2104.579" dur="5.371">the CIA went over there to talk to the</text>
  <text start="2107.22" dur="4.889">head there this is why Kerry is letting</text>
  <text start="2109.95" dur="5.159">everyone know that there&amp;#39;ll be military</text>
  <text start="2112.109" dur="5.131">people or military assets being moved</text>
  <text start="2115.109" dur="7.23">into Ukraine because it&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="2117.24" dur="7.379">happened now like we saw in Yemen and in</text>
  <text start="2122.339" dur="5.03">Libya we&amp;#39;re having the same problems in</text>
  <text start="2124.619" dur="5.011">rat in Iraq people are fighting back</text>

  <text start="2159.54" dur="5.82">people&amp;#39;s lives are not getting better it</text>
  <text start="2162.06" dur="5.58">is getting worse because the puppet</text>
  <text start="2165.36" dur="4.5">governments the central bankers could</text>
  <text start="2167.64" dur="4.38">care less about these people actually</text>
  <text start="2169.86" dur="5.19">they see all of these people in these</text>
  <text start="2172.02" dur="5.13">countries as terrorists as people that</text>
  <text start="2175.05" dur="3.93">they need to keep being pushed back they</text>
  <text start="2177.15" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t want them to speak they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="2178.98" dur="4.88">them to do anything and if they do they</text>
  <text start="2181.29" dur="4.86">fly in with drones and bomb them and</text>
  <text start="2183.86" dur="4.06">they don&amp;#39;t really care about these</text>
  <text start="2186.15" dur="4.05">people they want to make sure that they</text>
  <text start="2187.92" dur="4.5">hang on to the country they want to make</text>
  <text start="2190.2" dur="4.59">sure that the US dollar is still being</text>
  <text start="2192.42" dur="4.74">used as a reserve currency and this is</text>
  <text start="2194.79" dur="5.4">exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing now there is</text>
  <text start="2197.16" dur="6.63">a new report from the Federal Energy</text>
  <text start="2200.19" dur="6.66">regular regulatory commission ferc and</text>

  <text start="2206.85" dur="6.69">u.s. power grid for more than a month</text>
  <text start="2210.08" dur="5.77">there are another 30 crucial facilities</text>
  <text start="2213.54" dur="4.83">that use large transformers to boost</text>
  <text start="2215.85" dur="4.5">voltage over long distances and these</text>
  <text start="2218.37" dur="4.02">are the things when the power goes out</text>
  <text start="2220.35" dur="3.9">there giving us a list right now of what</text>
  <text start="2222.39" dur="4.59">would happen and we know a lot of this</text>
  <text start="2224.25" dur="5.1">but letting the general American public</text>
  <text start="2226.98" dur="3.75">know that when this false flag event</text>
