  <text start="50.02" dur="8.19">to start their own new army and the EU</text>
  <text start="54.09" dur="8.319">they&amp;#39;re looking to create their first</text>
  <text start="58.21" dur="7.41">security strategy since 2003 they want</text>
  <text start="62.409" dur="6.121">to strengthen the military to defend</text>
  <text start="65.62" dur="5.73">themselves without relying on NATO they</text>
  <text start="68.53" dur="5.34">want to counter Russian propaganda they</text>
  <text start="71.35" dur="4.55">want to keep control of the people they</text>
  <text start="73.87" dur="6.06">want to keep control of countries and</text>
  <text start="75.9" dur="6.61">the EU is chief diplomat he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="79.93" dur="4.979">present a new foreign policy and a</text>
  <text start="82.51" dur="5.789">security policy strategy later this week</text>
  <text start="84.909" dur="4.981">and the document is the --use first</text>
  <text start="88.299" dur="4.621">major foreign and security policy</text>
  <text start="89.89" dur="5.76">strategy and the new strategy is going</text>
  <text start="92.92" dur="8.46">to focus on building up european hard</text>
  <text start="95.65" dur="7.83">power to achieve strategic autonomy it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="101.38" dur="4.29">designed to cope with superpowers and</text>
  <text start="103.48" dur="5.52">deal with global policeman and loan</text>
  <text start="105.67" dur="5.13">warriors it specifically focused on</text>
  <text start="109" dur="5.01">countering propaganda from Russia and</text>
  <text start="110.8" dur="6.6">other countries and propaganda from the</text>
  <text start="114.01" dur="6.36">internet so what&amp;#39;s really happening</text>
  <text start="117.4" dur="7.23">right here well think about it</text>
  <text start="120.37" dur="8.66">the EU the central bankers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="124.63" dur="7.56">creating their own army their own forces</text>
  <text start="129.03" dur="5.56">not really relying on governments</text>
  <text start="132.19" dur="5.189">actually controlling other governments</text>
  <text start="134.59" dur="5.16">forces which they&amp;#39;re going to take on as</text>
  <text start="137.379" dur="6">their own so we&amp;#39;re starting to see a</text>
  <text start="139.75" dur="6.54">development of a central bank army</text>
  <text start="143.379" dur="6.72">because in the past what they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="146.29" dur="5.88">was they were controlling governments</text>
  <text start="150.099" dur="5.701">like the central bankers control the US</text>
  <text start="152.17" dur="6.329">and they used their forces and have them</text>
  <text start="155.8" dur="5.49">do their dirty work now they&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="158.499" dur="4.601">it to the next level they&amp;#39;re creating</text>
  <text start="161.29" dur="3.31">their own</text>
  <text start="163.1" dur="5.01">they don&amp;#39;t need the middleman anymore</text>
  <text start="164.6" dur="6.81">they want full power and this is what</text>
  <text start="168.11" dur="4.82">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and we should all</text>
  <text start="171.41" dur="4.25">be a little bit nervous about this</text>
  <text start="172.93" dur="7.3">because when you have a non-elected</text>
  <text start="175.66" dur="6.79">fascist anti-democratic organization</text>
  <text start="180.23" dur="5.25">that creates money out of thin air and</text>
  <text start="182.45" dur="6.36">puts everything into debt and does it to</text>
  <text start="185.48" dur="8.1">control everything and creates a police</text>
  <text start="188.81" dur="8.58">force and army establishes systems to</text>
  <text start="193.58" dur="6">counter what they call propaganda on the</text>
  <text start="197.39" dur="7.94">internet or from other places which</text>
  <text start="199.58" dur="8.55">don&amp;#39;t agree with their way of thinking</text>
  <text start="205.33" dur="6.31">we&amp;#39;re gonna have a major problem and we</text>
  <text start="208.13" dur="5.82">cannot let this happen now something</text>
  <text start="211.64" dur="5.31">very interesting in regards to the</text>
  <text start="213.95" dur="6">Orlando shooting and this is coming from</text>
  <text start="216.95" dur="6.15">Judge Napolitano where he was reading</text>
  <text start="219.95" dur="8.73">the FBI transcript and he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="223.1" dur="8.43">no one died until 5:13 a.m. which</text>
  <text start="228.68" dur="5.7">doesn&amp;#39;t jive with what everyone has told</text>
  <text start="231.53" dur="8.31">us about and this is very interesting</text>
  <text start="234.38" dur="9.68">because the 5:13 time period is when the</text>
  <text start="239.84" dur="7.74">SWAT team went into the nightclub so if</text>
  <text start="244.06" dur="7.9">nobody died prior to this</text>
  <text start="247.58" dur="6.69">according to the FBI transcript when did</text>
  <text start="251.96" dur="4.89">all these people die was it the SWAT</text>
  <text start="254.27" dur="6.48">team that killed him or was this all</text>
  <text start="256.85" dur="6.51">completely faked and we can see the</text>
  <text start="260.75" dur="4.56">story is really starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="263.36" dur="4.44">and this is why they never really</text>
  <text start="265.31" dur="7.65">released the audio version of the</text>
  <text start="267.8" dur="6.96">transcripts from 9-1-1 this is why they</text>
  <text start="272.96" dur="4.74">gave us a printed version which they can</text>
  <text start="274.76" dur="5.16">switch around they can modify and they</text>
  <text start="277.7" dur="3.9">most likely were afraid that if they did</text>
  <text start="279.92" dur="2.25">have the audio version if they really do</text>
  <text start="281.6" dur="2.61">exist</text>
  <text start="282.17" dur="4.76">people would analyze it and say this is</text>
  <text start="284.21" dur="6.63">not Omar this is somebody else</text>
  <text start="286.93" dur="7.18">so no matter what it seems that they</text>
  <text start="290.84" dur="5.58">just are lying we know this is</text>
  <text start="294.11" dur="4.02">completely fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="296.42" dur="5.94">and there&amp;#39;s more and more evidence</text>
  <text start="298.13" dur="9.66">coming out that this whole thing was</text>
  <text start="302.36" dur="8.94">staged and it was staged very poorly now</text>
  <text start="307.79" dur="8.49">DHS which is the Department of Homeland</text>
  <text start="311.3" dur="6.93">Security we know that sisse which is the</text>
  <text start="316.28" dur="4.59">cybersecurity information sharing act of</text>
  <text start="318.23" dur="5.55">2015 that was you know stuffed into</text>
  <text start="320.87" dur="7.26">other bills and it was passed and this</text>
  <text start="323.78" dur="7.02">allows corporations to share all your</text>
  <text start="328.13" dur="6.6">private information with the government</text>
  <text start="330.8" dur="6.81">and guess what they won&amp;#39;t be held</text>
  <text start="334.73" dur="5.37">responsible if anything should happen to</text>
  <text start="337.61" dur="7.85">this information the companies are</text>
  <text start="340.1" dur="8.43">shielded from any type of liability so</text>
  <text start="345.46" dur="6.91">DHS came up with a way where all these</text>
  <text start="348.53" dur="5.76">companies can send over the information</text>
  <text start="352.37" dur="4.08">now what they did was instead of having</text>
  <text start="354.29" dur="3.66">the US government spy on every single</text>
  <text start="356.45" dur="2.85">person they&amp;#39;re just going to get it from</text>
  <text start="357.95" dur="3.39">the corporations actually there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="359.3" dur="5.28">more information because people give</text>
  <text start="361.34" dur="4.95">their information freely their purchases</text>
  <text start="364.58" dur="5.34">are tracked their investments are</text>
  <text start="366.29" dur="5.49">tracked they banks companies they know</text>
  <text start="369.92" dur="6.36">exactly where people are because people</text>
  <text start="371.78" dur="6.42">turn on the location devices GPS they</text>
  <text start="376.28" dur="4.05">know all the information they know</text>
  <text start="378.2" dur="3.87">exactly where you are where you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="380.33" dur="3.66">what you&amp;#39;re doing so why don&amp;#39;t we just</text>
  <text start="382.07" dur="4.29">get it from the companies and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="383.99" dur="3.69">exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing and this is</text>
  <text start="386.36" dur="3.24">why I keep saying you need to protect</text>
  <text start="387.68" dur="4.71">yourself you need to use encryption</text>
  <text start="389.6" dur="4.98">because the government they have a very</text>
  <text start="392.39" dur="5.16">difficult time fake breaking encryption</text>
  <text start="394.58" dur="4.89">is it foolproof absolutely not neither</text>
  <text start="397.55" dur="3.81">is your safe either are the locks on</text>
  <text start="399.47" dur="4.53">your homes or you&amp;#39;re locking the windows</text>
  <text start="401.36" dur="4.92">or locking your car yes someone can</text>
  <text start="404" dur="5.13">still seal it but why not make it much</text>
  <text start="406.28" dur="6.42">more difficult so with your electronic</text>
  <text start="409.13" dur="5.67">information use encryption use a product</text>
  <text start="412.7" dur="4.29">like block apakah comm it&amp;#39;s a case where</text>
  <text start="414.8" dur="3.84">you can slip your iPhone you can slip</text>
  <text start="416.99" dur="3.69">your Android phone you can slip your</text>
  <text start="418.64" dur="3.75">iPad you can slip your credit card in</text>
  <text start="420.68" dur="3.72">there and it blocks the signal because</text>
  <text start="422.39" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s interwove in&amp;#39; with different metals</text>
  <text start="424.4" dur="5.96">copper silver and it blocks the signal</text>
  <text start="426.65" dur="7.759">and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="430.36" dur="5.67">DHS they&amp;#39;re going forward with taking</text>
  <text start="434.409" dur="4.861">all your information and tracking you</text>
  <text start="436.03" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re using a system which they</text>
  <text start="439.27" dur="5.63">develop which they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="440.59" dur="7.379">completely secure called taxi ta X III</text>
  <text start="444.9" dur="6.009">short for trusted automated exchange of</text>
  <text start="447.969" dur="5.57">indicator information and it is a</text>
  <text start="450.909" dur="4.681">technical protocol developed by DHS to</text>
  <text start="453.539" dur="6.041">securely and efficiently share</text>
  <text start="455.59" dur="5.4">cybersecurity information and all the</text>
  <text start="459.58" dur="5.19">companies are going to have a direct</text>
  <text start="460.99" dur="7.29">line right into DHS all your information</text>
  <text start="464.77" dur="5.34">will be submitted through this protocol</text>
  <text start="468.28" dur="6.3">now are they using encryption is it</text>
  <text start="470.11" dur="7.529">foolproof we know it isn&amp;#39;t we know that</text>
  <text start="474.58" dur="4.95">the information is going to be stolen we</text>
  <text start="477.639" dur="3.601">know it&amp;#39;s not going to be secure and we</text>
  <text start="479.53" dur="3.449">know that all this information is going</text>
  <text start="481.24" dur="6.209">to be going to all the other agencies</text>
  <text start="482.979" dur="6.72">and everyone will be tracked all your</text>
  <text start="487.449" dur="5.49">information will be correlated put into</text>
  <text start="489.699" dur="5.731">a database and the spying has not</text>
  <text start="492.939" dur="5.1">stopped at all of course this is a</text>
  <text start="495.43" dur="5.51">violation of your Fourth Amendment but</text>
  <text start="498.039" dur="5.37">our government employees they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="500.94" dur="4.569">you know why because you&amp;#39;re in they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="503.409" dur="3.901">not working for the people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="505.509" dur="4.261">working for corporations central banks</text>
  <text start="507.31" dur="5.729">and foreign governments and the system</text>
  <text start="509.77" dur="6.209">is coming to an end it&amp;#39;s collapsing they</text>
  <text start="513.039" dur="6.271">understand this and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="515.979" dur="4.92">looking to spy on everyone to understand</text>
  <text start="519.31" dur="3.899">what everyone is doing what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="520.899" dur="5.13">talking about this is why you hear the</text>
  <text start="523.209" dur="6.511">word lists come up especially after the</text>
  <text start="526.029" dur="5.401">Orlando false flag event where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="529.72" dur="3.9">saying hey maybe we should put those</text>
  <text start="531.43" dur="5.58">people on a list that can&amp;#39;t purchase</text>
  <text start="533.62" dur="6.3">weapons along with the no-fly list after</text>
  <text start="537.01" dur="6.12">that list will be the list of people who</text>
  <text start="539.92" dur="5.97">can&amp;#39;t speak freely and this will</text>
  <text start="543.13" dur="6.3">continue on because this is how it</text>
  <text start="545.89" dur="5.759">begins now in Venezuela couple of</text>
  <text start="549.43" dur="5.13">reports ago we mentioned how they needed</text>
  <text start="551.649" dur="5.461">enough signatures to start a referendum</text>
  <text start="554.56" dur="4.92">to oust Venezuelan president Nicolas</text>
  <text start="557.11" dur="4.589">Maduro and it looks like right now</text>
  <text start="559.48" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re getting to that area because</text>
  <text start="561.699" dur="5.101">there&amp;#39;s about 190 4720</text>
  <text start="564.1" dur="4.32">signatures that are needed to move to</text>
  <text start="566.8" dur="3.51">the second phase of the referendum and</text>
  <text start="568.42" dur="4.229">it looks like we&amp;#39;re getting to that area</text>
  <text start="570.31" dur="7.41">and there needs to be about a total of</text>
  <text start="572.649" dur="10.081">about 7.5 million votes or signatures to</text>
  <text start="577.72" dur="7.77">get rid of and remove Maduro from office</text>
  <text start="582.73" dur="4.349">and it looks like they are pushing this</text>
  <text start="585.49" dur="3.3">very hard because we already see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="587.079" dur="4.26">happening in Brazil we see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="588.79" dur="4.349">happening in Venezuela the United States</text>
  <text start="591.339" dur="4.74">government central bankers they need</text>

  <text start="596.079" dur="3.901">need these countries they need the</text>
  <text start="598.36" dur="3.3">natural resources they need to place a</text>
  <text start="599.98" dur="3.99">central bank in each one of these</text>
  <text start="601.66" dur="4.619">countries because they&amp;#39;re losing control</text>
  <text start="603.97" dur="3.69">of the Middle East they need to gain</text>
  <text start="606.279" dur="4.591">control of the Middle East they need</text>
  <text start="607.66" dur="5.46">control of South America to prop up the</text>
  <text start="610.87" dur="4.829">petro dollar because in their minds they</text>
  <text start="613.12" dur="6.029">do believe if they do this they can keep</text>
  <text start="615.699" dur="6.361">the system going but they can&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="619.149" dur="7.231">system is coming to an end</text>
  <text start="622.06" dur="6.69">the debt level is too high it cannot</text>
  <text start="626.38" dur="5.22">continue on there&amp;#39;s a new system already</text>
  <text start="628.75" dur="4.949">being pushed out there China and Russia</text>
  <text start="631.6" dur="4.109">and many of the BRIC nations are</text>
  <text start="633.699" dur="4.221">separating themselves from the West</text>
  <text start="635.709" dur="4.68">everything&amp;#39;s being duplicated right now</text>

  <text start="674.649" dur="3.06">throughout Europe as many of the</text>
  <text start="676.689" dur="3.27">countries are saying let&amp;#39;s have a</text>
