  <text start="21.49" dur="5.87">episode is called connecting the</text>
  <text start="22.93" dur="8.669">economic collapse thoughts we start in</text>
  <text start="27.36" dur="6.37">2008 we had the crash now I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="31.599" dur="4.8">basically just read off the list and</text>
  <text start="33.73" dur="4.74">lead up to what I think will we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="36.399" dur="5.761">headed and what&amp;#39;s going to happen I mean</text>
  <text start="38.47" dur="6.63">we had the 2008 crash where many people</text>
  <text start="42.16" dur="8.16">have lost their wealth their savings</text>
  <text start="45.1" dur="8.25">their retirements their jobs and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="50.32" dur="5.969">never really recovered from that the</text>
  <text start="53.35" dur="4.169">banks were bailed out of course they</text>
  <text start="56.289" dur="3.331">were the ones that caused the entire</text>
  <text start="57.519" dur="3.84">thing but they were bailed out with tons</text>
  <text start="59.62" dur="5.04">of money the people on the other hand</text>
  <text start="61.359" dur="5.161">were left to fend for themselves I know</text>
  <text start="64.66" dur="4.41">many many people that were laid off</text>
  <text start="66.52" dur="4.08">never got another job</text>
  <text start="69.07" dur="4.89">making the same salary action making</text>
  <text start="70.6" dur="7.2">less lost their homes and they were</text>
  <text start="73.96" dur="6.75">never given anything today if you look</text>
  <text start="77.8" dur="6.78">at the market the Federal Reserve is</text>
  <text start="80.71" dur="5.46">buying most of the bonds today many</text>
  <text start="84.58" dur="4.74">people are saying that the bond market</text>
  <text start="86.17" dur="5.46">is in a bubble you know to me it looks</text>
  <text start="89.32" dur="3.35">like it&amp;#39;s in a bubble but we will see</text>
  <text start="91.63" dur="4.17">what happens</text>
  <text start="92.67" dur="5.77">unemployment I mean I know they have</text>
  <text start="95.8" dur="5.67">these tons of statistics showing you</text>
  <text start="98.44" dur="5.21">know unemployment&amp;#39;s coming down but just</text>
  <text start="101.47" dur="4.56">say to yourself let&amp;#39;s use common sense</text>
  <text start="103.65" dur="7.09">how many people do you know that lost</text>
  <text start="106.03" dur="6.96">their job can&amp;#39;t find a job or had a job</text>
  <text start="110.74" dur="6.75">but doing something different making a</text>
  <text start="112.99" dur="7.89">lot less myself I know for people I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="117.49" dur="5.94">never known that many people who have</text>
  <text start="120.88" dur="4.89">either lost their job or have a job now</text>
  <text start="123.43" dur="6.839">that&amp;#39;s that they&amp;#39;re making a lot less</text>
  <text start="125.77" dur="6.84">than they did before so it&amp;#39;s very hard</text>
  <text start="130.269" dur="5.701">to believe the numbers of unemployment</text>
  <text start="132.61" dur="4.07">that&amp;#39;s coming out it just that makes no</text>
  <text start="135.97" dur="4.29">sense to me</text>
  <text start="136.68" dur="4.97">the dollar is losing value every day I</text>
  <text start="140.26" dur="8.199">mean we see things</text>
  <text start="141.65" dur="11.19">going up like milk cheese butter coffee</text>
  <text start="148.459" dur="9.631">on my website I am tracking inflation on</text>
  <text start="152.84" dur="7.41">all of these products ice cream and when</text>
  <text start="158.09" dur="3.39">I look every time I go shopping I see</text>
  <text start="160.25" dur="4.5">things shrinking down</text>
  <text start="161.48" dur="5.399">I see prices going up and then I go on</text>
  <text start="164.75" dur="4.409">to the mainstream news media and they</text>
  <text start="166.879" dur="5.071">tell me there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong inflation</text>
  <text start="169.159" dur="5.011">there is no inflation but everything</text>
  <text start="171.95" dur="5.58">that that I buy in the market is</text>
  <text start="174.17" dur="5.37">continually going up so to me it makes</text>
  <text start="177.53" dur="5.819">no sense what they&amp;#39;re saying and what</text>
  <text start="179.54" dur="5.819">I&amp;#39;m seeing so it&amp;#39;s for me it&amp;#39;s hard to</text>
  <text start="183.349" dur="4.321">believe that there&amp;#39;s no inflation one</text>
  <text start="185.359" dur="6.811">I&amp;#39;m actually tracking it and I&amp;#39;m showing</text>
  <text start="187.67" dur="8.31">inflation on all of these items right</text>
  <text start="192.17" dur="7.89">now the stock market to me is completely</text>
  <text start="195.98" dur="8.009">propped up I mean every time the stock</text>
  <text start="200.06" dur="6.269">market goes down it&amp;#39;s pushed back up it</text>
  <text start="203.989" dur="5.521">goes down it&amp;#39;s pushed back up for</text>
  <text start="206.329" dur="6.75">instance Bernanke just spoke these last</text>
  <text start="209.51" dur="6.9">two days and the market came down before</text>
  <text start="213.079" dur="8.97">he spoke and miraculously the market</text>
  <text start="216.41" dur="8.31">made huge highs out of nowhere I mean</text>

  <text start="224.72" dur="7.019">news from the previous day when I went</text>
  <text start="227.389" dur="9.69">down 200 points to the next morning what</text>

  <text start="237.079" dur="5.37">new highs almost new highs it makes no</text>

  <text start="307.07" dur="6.18">understand how gold in the middle of the</text>
  <text start="310.13" dur="5.97">night goes up and then it&amp;#39;s smacked down</text>
  <text start="313.25" dur="5.52">as soon as the markets open it goes up</text>

  <text start="328.52" dur="8.33">in the economy that&amp;#39;s going on I mean do</text>
  <text start="331.37" dur="5.48">you really think that this is a true</text>
  <text start="338.47" dur="6.58">capitalistic market and businesses are</text>

  <text start="429.86" dur="5.91">everything what&amp;#39;s leading up to the</text>
  <text start="431.95" dur="7.09">economic collapse and it is a work in</text>
