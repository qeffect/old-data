  <text start="129.45" dur="5.64">unemployment will be coming down and</text>
  <text start="131.55" dur="7.61">everything is going well and we could</text>
  <text start="135.09" dur="7.46">have a paper as early as December</text>
  <text start="139.16" dur="6.03">and again they will not taper whatsoever</text>
  <text start="142.55" dur="4.83">they have no intentions of taper but</text>
  <text start="145.19" dur="5.1">they are going to use the illusion that</text>
  <text start="147.38" dur="6.93">they are going to tempt to taper and</text>

  <text start="810.19" dur="5.28">article about a business owner who says</text>
  <text start="813.22" dur="6.9">that he has about six hundred employees</text>
  <text start="815.47" dur="7.02">and the employees were paying something</text>
  <text start="820.12" dur="4.05">like nine dollars per week for their</text>
  <text start="822.49" dur="3.87">insurance and the company would make up</text>
  <text start="824.17" dur="3.6">the rest and their total bill came out</text>
  <text start="826.36" dur="3.33">to about seven hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="827.77" dur="3.41">thousand dollars a year for medical</text>
  <text start="829.69" dur="4.76">insurance when they looked into</text>
  <text start="831.18" dur="5.74">Obamacare going on to the exchanges and</text>
  <text start="834.45" dur="4.33">they weren&amp;#39;t ensuring all six hundred</text>
  <text start="836.92" dur="3.72">people because some people opted out of</text>
  <text start="838.78" dur="3.72">it and you weren&amp;#39;t penalized when you</text>
  <text start="840.64" dur="3.93">did that because their spouse might have</text>
  <text start="842.5" dur="5.1">had insurance someplace else but now</text>
  <text start="844.57" dur="5.55">under Obamacare people cannot opt out or</text>
  <text start="847.6" dur="7.05">you&amp;#39;re penalized so this isn&amp;#39;t this</text>
  <text start="850.12" dur="7.89">company was saying that they looked into</text>
  <text start="854.65" dur="6.78">Obamacare and if they went off of what</text>
  <text start="858.01" dur="5.46">they had right now on to a new insurance</text>
  <text start="861.43" dur="4.14">policy instead of seven hundred and</text>
  <text start="863.47" dur="5.16">fifty thousand dollars a year they would</text>
  <text start="865.57" dur="5.13">have to pay two million a year and each</text>
  <text start="868.63" dur="4.5">person wouldn&amp;#39;t be paying nine dollars a</text>
  <text start="870.7" dur="6.21">week they&amp;#39;d be paying thirty dollars a</text>
  <text start="873.13" dur="5.46">week with a deductible of around I think</text>
  <text start="876.91" dur="4.65">it was like five thousand dollars per</text>
  <text start="878.59" dur="4.83">year and their deductible right now with</text>
  <text start="881.56" dur="4.56">their other insurance is about a hundred</text>
  <text start="883.42" dur="5.24">and fifty dollars so you can see this is</text>
  <text start="886.12" dur="9.81">a no-win situation for pretty much</text>
  <text start="888.66" dur="11.41">everyone now we are seeing the police</text>

  <text start="928.03" dur="7.8">violation of the Fourth Amendment and</text>
  <text start="930.34" dur="7.35">this went on to say that dozens of texas</text>
  <text start="935.83" dur="4.14">drivers have been stopped at a police</text>
  <text start="937.69" dur="3.87">roadblock where they were then directed</text>

  <text start="961.06" dur="5.15">they can be forced off the road when</text>
  <text start="963.76" dur="5.1">you&amp;#39;re not doing anything wrong she</text>
  <text start="966.21" dur="4.569">gestured and she&amp;#39;s saying I gesture to</text>

  <text start="979.66" dur="5.429">took a breathalyzer test but again it</text>
  <text start="982.24" dur="5.61">just did not feel voluntary this is a</text>

  <text start="987.85" dur="5.79">would respond to this type of police</text>

  <text start="1359.69" dur="4.349">breaks out and the United States of</text>
  <text start="1361.789" dur="5.52">course said well we need these nine</text>
  <text start="1364.039" dur="6.601">bases to train you know the top brass of</text>
  <text start="1367.309" dur="5.461">the Afghan defence ministry ministry and</text>
  <text start="1370.64" dur="4.14">this is why we need them and the Russian</text>
  <text start="1372.77" dur="4.8">government said well that&amp;#39;s about 400</text>
  <text start="1374.78" dur="6.779">people you really need nine bases for</text>

  <text start="1381.559" dur="4.561">didn&amp;#39;t answer and that was the end of</text>
  <text start="1383.72" dur="4.67">that and we understand what is really</text>
  <text start="1386.12" dur="5.22">happening at this point is that</text>
  <text start="1388.39" dur="6.1">Afghanistan is eight rity gical ok shin</text>
  <text start="1391.34" dur="5.579">it is a perfect place to set up and keep</text>
  <text start="1394.49" dur="4.74">these bases during war because it gives</text>
  <text start="1396.919" dur="7.14">them access to Russia it gives them</text>
  <text start="1399.23" dur="9.42">access to a ramp now we&amp;#39;ve seen this in</text>
  <text start="1404.059" dur="7.441">the past where the United States brings</text>
  <text start="1408.65" dur="4.56">in weapons military assets troops and</text>

  <text start="1415.78" dur="6.7">eventually it really isn&amp;#39;t they use it</text>
  <text start="1418.309" dur="5.971">for a strike a false flag event and we</text>
  <text start="1422.48" dur="4.89">saw this happen during the Syrian</text>

  <text start="1433.73" dur="8.12">just so happened to leave them there</text>
  <text start="1435.11" dur="11.49">well right now 40,000 NATO troops are</text>

  <text start="1454.1" dur="5.34">you know last until 2015 and Beyond and</text>
  <text start="1457.429" dur="5.701">they&amp;#39;re going to be stationed right</text>
  <text start="1459.44" dur="6.75">against you know Russia and they&amp;#39;ll be</text>

  <text start="1466.19" dur="7.469">for they were positioning these troops</text>
  <text start="1468.59" dur="7.11">to be ready to go when war breaks out</text>
  <text start="1473.659" dur="2.461">and this is why they&amp;#39;re training this is</text>
  <text start="1475.7" dur="3.87">why there</text>
  <text start="1476.12" dur="6.42">trills and this is why all of this is</text>
  <text start="1479.57" dur="6.09">happening at this point and this report</text>
  <text start="1482.54" dur="6.72">goes on to say this is very suspicious</text>

  <text start="1676.309" dur="3.931">serves attacks will kind of died off</text>
  <text start="1678.38" dur="4.47">because they really don&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="1680.24" dur="4.5">all they do is they make the site</text>

  <text start="1684.74" dur="6.03">that really does nothing what their main</text>
  <text start="1687.32" dur="7.89">concern is is they&amp;#39;re predicting that</text>
  <text start="1690.77" dur="8.94">there will be in 2014 some type of major</text>
  <text start="1695.21" dur="8.31">data destruction attack that will happen</text>

  <text start="1724.85" dur="4.98">to be you know that they owe or they</text>
  <text start="1727.73" dur="5.34">lost or you know just like the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="1729.83" dur="5.79">is always you know as missing trillions</text>

  <text start="1735.62" dur="6.029">day and this is what they are saying</text>
  <text start="1738.26" dur="6.24">that some type of data destruction now</text>
  <text start="1741.649" dur="5.191">along with what general Dempsey has said</text>
  <text start="1744.5" dur="5.1">and of course all the other reports that</text>
  <text start="1746.84" dur="4.38">I&amp;#39;ve been doing some type of attack is</text>
  <text start="1749.6" dur="8.01">going to happen and we understand this</text>
  <text start="1751.22" dur="7.86">and what is coming this major event that</text>
  <text start="1757.61" dur="4.38">I talked about right in the beginning of</text>
  <text start="1759.08" dur="4.86">this report this is what is going to</text>
  <text start="1761.99" dur="5.67">happen at this time because we are</text>
  <text start="1763.94" dur="6.69">seeing many of the same things that are</text>
  <text start="1767.66" dur="5.07">happening right now gold has been</text>
  <text start="1770.63" dur="5.22">smacked down in my other reports I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1772.73" dur="6.81">said we will see gold being pushed down</text>
  <text start="1775.85" dur="7.32">pushed down push down and this is an</text>
  <text start="1779.54" dur="6.3">indicator that a major event is ready to</text>
  <text start="1783.17" dur="6.42">go hot and what I&amp;#39;m talking about is</text>
  <text start="1785.84" dur="5.94">this false flag event we&amp;#39;ve seen the</text>
  <text start="1789.59" dur="7.52">same thing happen before the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1791.78" dur="8.34">event now the set is back saying that in</text>
  <text start="1797.11" dur="6.04">the coming months they are looking to</text>
  <text start="1800.12" dur="5.15">taper and from the Fed minutes they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1803.15" dur="4.86">there what they&amp;#39;re saying now is that</text>
  <text start="1805.27" dur="5.05">several significant risks remaining for</text>
  <text start="1808.01" dur="4.82">the economy but not too bad the Fed</text>
  <text start="1810.32" dur="5.25">taper likely in coming months or better</text>
  <text start="1812.83" dur="4.06">it might even happen in December they</text>
  <text start="1815.57" dur="4.44">have to you know they have to check</text>
  <text start="1816.89" dur="4.5">their fake you know economic figures to</text>
  <text start="1820.01" dur="2.7">determine if they&amp;#39;re going to do it</text>
  <text start="1821.39" dur="3.75">actually what they&amp;#39;re doing is to see if</text>
  <text start="1822.71" dur="3.87">the event is a go and if it is then</text>
  <text start="1825.14" dur="3.06">they&amp;#39;ll make the case like oh we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1826.58" dur="3.24">going to taper or they&amp;#39;ll even start</text>
  <text start="1828.2" dur="3.63">tapering a little bit just to show that</text>
  <text start="1829.82" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re actually doing it and then</text>
  <text start="1831.83" dur="5.22">you&amp;#39;ll see things really happen here but</text>
  <text start="1835.37" dur="4.08">I thought something was very interesting</text>
  <text start="1837.05" dur="6.33">when I was reading the Fed minutes here</text>
  <text start="1839.45" dur="6.12">and you know the FMO FOMC saw a downside</text>
  <text start="1843.38" dur="4.8">risk to the economy labor market</text>
  <text start="1845.57" dur="4.62">diminished and they also saw a consumer</text>
  <text start="1848.18" dur="4.62">sentiment remaining unusually low and</text>
  <text start="1850.19" dur="7.65">they also saw a recovery in housing as</text>
  <text start="1852.8" dur="7.56">having slowed some what hmm so then I</text>
  <text start="1857.84" dur="6.09">would like to read you something else so</text>
  <text start="1860.36" dur="6.93">that was from today this is from the Fed</text>
  <text start="1863.93" dur="5.37">minutes and let me read you this the</text>
  <text start="1867.29" dur="4.41">pace of home sales seems like to remain</text>
  <text start="1869.3" dur="3.9">sluggish for a time partly as a result</text>
  <text start="1871.7" dur="3.03">of some tightening and lending standards</text>
  <text start="1873.2" dur="3.36">and the recent increase in mortgage</text>
  <text start="1874.73" dur="2.59">interest rates hey we&amp;#39;re seeing the same</text>
  <text start="1876.56" dur="2.41">thing right now</text>
  <text start="1877.32" dur="3.359">what we&amp;#39;re saying sales should</text>
  <text start="1878.97" dur="3.9">ultimately be supported by growth in</text>
  <text start="1880.679" dur="3.811">income and employment as well as by</text>
  <text start="1882.87" dur="3.21">mortgage rates that despite the recent</text>
  <text start="1884.49" dur="4.89">increase remain fairly low relative</text>
  <text start="1886.08" dur="5.67">historical norms however even if demand</text>
  <text start="1889.38" dur="4.019">stabilizes as we expect the pace of</text>
  <text start="1891.75" dur="3.33">construction will probably fall somewhat</text>
  <text start="1893.399" dur="3.75">further we&amp;#39;re seeing that right now</text>
  <text start="1895.08" dur="4.53">people are cancelling their their homes</text>
  <text start="1897.149" dur="5.16">as builders work down the stocks of</text>
  <text start="1899.61" dur="4.049">unsold new homes thus declines of</text>
  <text start="1902.309" dur="3.571">residential construction will likely</text>
  <text start="1903.659" dur="4.711">continue to weigh on economic growth in</text>
  <text start="1905.88" dur="3.899">coming quarters although the magnitude</text>
  <text start="1908.37" dur="4.08">of the dragon growth should diminish</text>
  <text start="1909.779" dur="5.161">over time the global economy continues</text>
  <text start="1912.45" dur="5.609">to be strong supported by solid economic</text>
  <text start="1914.94" dur="5.52">growth abroad US exports should expand</text>
  <text start="1918.059" dur="4.62">further in coming quarters overall the</text>
  <text start="1920.46" dur="5.61">US economy seems like likely to expand</text>
  <text start="1922.679" dur="7.83">at a moderate pace with growth then</text>
  <text start="1926.07" dur="6.989">strengthening in a bit in 2014 to rate</text>
  <text start="1930.509" dur="6.061">close to the economy&amp;#39;s underlying trend</text>
  <text start="1933.059" dur="6.421">now I changed the date there but this is</text>
  <text start="1936.57" dur="6.92">what they said back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="1939.48" dur="6.96">eight and 2007 this was from Bernanke</text>
  <text start="1943.49" dur="6.48">doesn&amp;#39;t it seem like it fits absolutely</text>
  <text start="1946.44" dur="5.4">perfect to what is happening right now I</text>
  <text start="1949.97" dur="4">just thought that was very interesting</text>
  <text start="1951.84" dur="4.829">that they&amp;#39;re saying the same thing in</text>
  <text start="1953.97" dur="7.169">today&amp;#39;s minutes and this is from the</text>
  <text start="1956.669" dur="6.21">minutes back in 2007 and into 2008 you</text>
  <text start="1961.139" dur="6.12">know the same year that we had a stock</text>
  <text start="1962.879" dur="8.13">market crash hmm so right now what we</text>
  <text start="1967.259" dur="6.39">are seeing is the same exact things that</text>
  <text start="1971.009" dur="5.431">happen before the Syrian event and a</text>
  <text start="1973.649" dur="5.13">report that came out today okay now we</text>
  <text start="1976.44" dur="5.55">understand before I get into this report</text>
  <text start="1978.779" dur="5.041">that came out we understand that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1981.99" dur="3.539">been building the propaganda of lone</text>
  <text start="1983.82" dur="4.439">wolves they&amp;#39;ve been building the</text>
  <text start="1985.529" dur="5.701">propaganda of al Qaeda they&amp;#39;ve given us</text>
  <text start="1988.259" dur="5.851">warnings you know American civilians or</text>
  <text start="1991.23" dur="5.549">a fair game and they&amp;#39;re coming after us</text>
  <text start="1994.11" dur="6.12">and you know they have a new al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="1996.779" dur="5.581">Lear called the Syrian I&amp;#39;ve said this in</text>
  <text start="2000.23" dur="5.25">my other reports now we understand that</text>
  <text start="2002.36" dur="5.25">now what came out today and you can see</text>
  <text start="2005.48" dur="4.11">how this is all playing into what they</text>
  <text start="2007.61" dur="3.63">want the American people to believe and</text>
  <text start="2009.59" dur="4.08">of course those people who are sleep</text>
  <text start="2011.24" dur="4.05">or just reading all this and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
