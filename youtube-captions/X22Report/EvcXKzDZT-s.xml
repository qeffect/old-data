  <text start="82.3" dur="6.609">indicators and what the government what</text>
  <text start="86.179" dur="6.271">the central bank&amp;#39;s what the banks are</text>
  <text start="88.909" dur="5.761">saying at this point because when we</text>
  <text start="92.45" dur="4.199">start to look around and we hear what</text>
  <text start="94.67" dur="4.559">they&amp;#39;re saying we see the opposite</text>
  <text start="96.649" dur="5.97">occurring now they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="99.229" dur="6.39">us that the economy is doing better</text>
  <text start="102.619" dur="6.721">Europe has recovered they continually</text>
  <text start="105.619" dur="6.03">push the idea that everything is fine in</text>
  <text start="109.34" dur="5.4">Europe we see here in the United States</text>
  <text start="111.649" dur="6.871">Obama is out there trying to defend why</text>
  <text start="114.74" dur="5.19">the economy is falling apart actually</text>
  <text start="118.52" dur="3.75">he&amp;#39;s saying it&amp;#39;s not falling apart it</text>
  <text start="119.93" dur="5.729">was the problem of everyone else except</text>
  <text start="122.27" dur="5.669">for him the central bank they&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="125.659" dur="4.71">their Fed meeting and they reported that</text>
  <text start="127.939" dur="5.58">everything is fine in the economy and we</text>
  <text start="130.369" dur="6.811">know they&amp;#39;re continually creating</text>
  <text start="133.519" dur="5.611">currency through QE we understand</text>
  <text start="137.18" dur="4.23">there&amp;#39;s negative interest rates we</text>
  <text start="139.13" dur="7.71">understand eventually as the debt has</text>
  <text start="141.41" dur="11.37">grown they will have to implement some</text>
  <text start="146.84" dur="9.239">type of wealth tax carbon tax or due</text>
  <text start="152.78" dur="5.64">balance or all the above because what</text>
  <text start="156.079" dur="4.771">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a</text>
  <text start="158.42" dur="5.68">deterioration of the entire economic</text>
  <text start="160.85" dur="5.91">system and right now we see do</text>
  <text start="164.1" dur="4.98">to bank they are in trouble and</text>
  <text start="166.76" dur="5.59">according to Deutsche Bank&amp;#39;s Dominic</text>
  <text start="169.08" dur="5.94">Konstam he&amp;#39;s saying that now since the</text>
  <text start="172.35" dur="6.36">benefits of QE have run their course it</text>
  <text start="175.02" dur="6.3">is time for the next phase and what is</text>
  <text start="178.71" dur="6.96">the next phase well it looks like it</text>
  <text start="181.32" dur="7.83">could be a wealth tax now if they impose</text>
  <text start="185.67" dur="4.65">a wealth tax who&amp;#39;s going to be affected</text>
  <text start="189.15" dur="3.36">well it&amp;#39;s going to be all the people</text>
  <text start="190.32" dur="5.13">around the world and what that means is</text>
  <text start="192.51" dur="4.8">they want taxes and revenue coming in to</text>
  <text start="195.45" dur="3.21">bring down the debt they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="197.31" dur="2.85">pay the debt off that&amp;#39;s not how their</text>
  <text start="198.66" dur="3.54">system works they just want to bring it</text>
  <text start="200.16" dur="4.23">down a little bit so they can sustain it</text>
  <text start="202.2" dur="6.03">now the people are going to lose more</text>
  <text start="204.39" dur="5.61">and more of their wealth and what that</text>
  <text start="208.23" dur="4.32">means is it&amp;#39;s going to make it harder</text>
  <text start="210" dur="4.92">and harder for them so we can see where</text>
  <text start="212.55" dur="5.19">we&amp;#39;re going at this point now out in</text>
  <text start="214.92" dur="5.49">Italy we know their banks are in a huge</text>
  <text start="217.74" dur="4.11">amount of trouble now the Italian banks</text>
  <text start="220.41" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re saddled with about three hundred</text>
  <text start="221.85" dur="5.91">and sixty billion euros of</text>
  <text start="224.37" dur="7.25">non-performing loans and the problem is</text>
  <text start="227.76" dur="7.29">is they do not have enough funds to</text>
  <text start="231.62" dur="7.66">rescue these banks they only managed to</text>
  <text start="235.05" dur="6.06">raise about 4.25 billion euros from 67</text>
  <text start="239.28" dur="5.04">italian and international institution</text>
  <text start="241.11" dur="6.72">and this is a tiny fraction of what they</text>
  <text start="244.32" dur="6.75">need and this is going to be a huge huge</text>
  <text start="247.83" dur="6.24">problem going forward because we see</text>
  <text start="251.07" dur="6.18">already Austria Italy they&amp;#39;re all having</text>
  <text start="254.07" dur="6.75">ballons at this time and we see right</text>
  <text start="257.25" dur="6.57">now that deutsche bank the italian banks</text>
  <text start="260.82" dur="4.5">austrian banks they&amp;#39;re all in trouble</text>
  <text start="263.82" dur="5.01">and if we look at the united states</text>
  <text start="265.32" dur="5.79">those banks are in trouble and we see to</text>
  <text start="268.83" dur="4.13">impose the wealth tax basically what</text>
  <text start="271.11" dur="6.77">they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="272.96" dur="7.84">tax the people in their savings accounts</text>
  <text start="277.88" dur="5.71">this is what they&amp;#39;re planning at this</text>
  <text start="280.8" dur="7.23">point in time why because the economy is</text>
  <text start="283.59" dur="8.34">breaking down now the US Treasury they</text>
  <text start="288.03" dur="7.61">are warning China Germany Japan not to</text>
  <text start="291.93" dur="5.91">devalue their currencies and we see</text>
  <text start="295.64" dur="3.97">right now that</text>
  <text start="297.84" dur="3.9">as they continually devalue their</text>
  <text start="299.61" dur="4.77">currencies the value of the dollar</text>
  <text start="301.74" dur="4.59">continually goes up and it makes it very</text>
  <text start="304.38" dur="4.47">hard for the United States to operate</text>
  <text start="306.33" dur="5.55">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="308.85" dur="4.98">reflecting on the economy and this is</text>
  <text start="311.88" dur="4.77">what happens during currency wars in</text>
  <text start="313.83" dur="4.589">other words the next country that dares</text>
  <text start="316.65" dur="4.35">to engage in wholesale currency</text>
  <text start="318.419" dur="5.731">devaluation with the US without its</text>
  <text start="321" dur="6.24">permission they&amp;#39;re going to get it at</text>
  <text start="324.15" dur="5.01">what that it is we don&amp;#39;t know but</text>
  <text start="327.24" dur="3.989">they&amp;#39;re making a threat to all these</text>
  <text start="329.16" dur="4.05">countries don&amp;#39;t do this anymore because</text>
  <text start="331.229" dur="5.071">the entire system is crumbling and</text>
  <text start="333.21" dur="7.41">falling apart now on tuesday the senate</text>
  <text start="336.3" dur="8.91">blocked a vote senator rand paul&amp;#39;s vote</text>
  <text start="340.62" dur="6.87">a bill on auditing the Fed now you would</text>
  <text start="345.21" dur="4.5">think the US government would want to</text>
  <text start="347.49" dur="4.08">audit the Fed to make sure everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="349.71" dur="5.79">on the up-and-up just like you wanted to</text>
  <text start="351.57" dur="5.37">audit any corporation that&amp;#39;s in business</text>
  <text start="355.5" dur="2.789">and of course those corporations that</text>
  <text start="356.94" dur="2.94">say no no we don&amp;#39;t want to know added</text>
  <text start="358.289" dur="4.561">you know they&amp;#39;re doing something wrong</text>
  <text start="359.88" dur="5.7">now of course what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="362.85" dur="4.289">now is the bill would have authorized</text>
  <text start="365.58" dur="4.26">the General Accounting Office to have</text>
  <text start="367.139" dur="4.681">access to more information of the</text>
  <text start="369.84" dur="3.99">Federal Reserve and they would have</text>
  <text start="371.82" dur="3.75">delved into things that the Federal</text>
  <text start="373.83" dur="3.059">Reserve didn&amp;#39;t want the US government</text>
  <text start="375.57" dur="3.599">looking at remember the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="376.889" dur="5.25">is a private corporation they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="379.169" dur="5.911">part of the government whatsoever and of</text>
  <text start="382.139" dur="5.101">course they&amp;#39;re using the excuse of the</text>
  <text start="385.08" dur="3.99">the reason why we don&amp;#39;t want you to</text>
  <text start="387.24" dur="3.899">order the Fed is because it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="389.07" dur="4.11">hurt small businesses it&amp;#39;s going to hurt</text>
  <text start="391.139" dur="4.891">the economy really I think this is what</text>
  <text start="393.18" dur="4.26">Enron said when they were going to be</text>
  <text start="396.03" dur="3.81">ordered that it would hurt the</text>
  <text start="397.44" dur="4.77">communities it would hurt the businesses</text>
  <text start="399.84" dur="4.11">across the country and it wouldn&amp;#39;t be a</text>
  <text start="402.21" dur="5.67">really good idea to start auditing us</text>
  <text start="403.95" dur="6.12">well we found out that guess what they</text>
  <text start="407.88" dur="5.46">were a scam artists they were ripping</text>
  <text start="410.07" dur="5.73">off everybody and the whole thing was a</text>
  <text start="413.34" dur="3.72">sham well if they ordered the Fed guess</text>
  <text start="415.8" dur="3.089">what we&amp;#39;re going to see we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="417.06" dur="4.89">see the exact same thing now very</text>
  <text start="418.889" dur="6">interestingly i have a list here on the</text>
  <text start="421.95" dur="5.399">x 22 report com site which shows which</text>
  <text start="424.889" dur="5.52">senators voted yes for the audit and</text>
  <text start="427.349" dur="4.211">which senators said no to the to the</text>
  <text start="430.409" dur="5.291">audit now</text>
  <text start="431.56" dur="6.87">question is those no senators are they</text>
  <text start="435.7" dur="4.53">on the payroll of the Fed to do their</text>
  <text start="438.43" dur="4.38">bidding of course they are what other</text>
  <text start="440.23" dur="6.75">incentive would it be for them to vote</text>
  <text start="442.81" dur="6.93">no of a system that&amp;#39;s supposed to be</text>
  <text start="446.98" dur="5.55">handling the finances of the entire</text>
  <text start="449.74" dur="6.48">country by creating money out of thin</text>
  <text start="452.53" dur="6.69">air so we can see at this point that the</text>
  <text start="456.22" dur="5.4">only reason the Fed is operational is</text>
  <text start="459.22" dur="5.36">because they pay off certain government</text>
  <text start="461.62" dur="6.9">employees and keep them in line and</text>
  <text start="464.58" dur="7.18">that&amp;#39;s it now as this economy</text>
  <text start="468.52" dur="5.85">continually deteriorates we see the the</text>
  <text start="471.76" dur="4.89">government right now is looking to spy</text>
  <text start="474.37" dur="3.87">on more and more people it&amp;#39;s looking for</text>
  <text start="476.65" dur="3.3">wealth tax is looking to bring in more</text>
  <text start="478.24" dur="4.02">revenue it&amp;#39;s looking to take away the</text>
  <text start="479.95" dur="3.96">rights of the people and right now the</text>
  <text start="482.26" dur="4.17">Supreme Court approved new rules on</text>
  <text start="483.91" dur="4.44">Thursday that would give the FBI the</text>
  <text start="486.43" dur="4.2">authority to hack any computer in the</text>
  <text start="488.35" dur="5.24">United States and maybe some computers</text>
  <text start="490.63" dur="5.039">overseas now a magistrate judge with</text>
  <text start="493.59" dur="4.12">authority in any district where</text>
  <text start="495.669" dur="3.781">activities related to crime guess what</text>
  <text start="497.71" dur="5.16">they have the authority to issue a</text>
  <text start="499.45" dur="6.15">warrant to use remote access to search</text>
  <text start="502.87" dur="5.25">electronic storage they can seize or</text>
  <text start="505.6" dur="5.97">copy the information they have full</text>
  <text start="508.12" dur="6.299">access and this legislation also says</text>
  <text start="511.57" dur="5.13">that if the media or information is</text>
  <text start="514.419" dur="5.611">located has been concealed through</text>
  <text start="516.7" dur="5.219">technological means what the question is</text>
  <text start="520.03" dur="4.65">what does conceal through technological</text>
  <text start="521.919" dur="5.341">means mean well the court is referring</text>
  <text start="524.68" dur="5.01">to computers who location is hidden via</text>
  <text start="527.26" dur="6.03">the use of anonymity software such as</text>
  <text start="529.69" dur="5.399">the tour web browser currently the</text>
  <text start="533.29" dur="6.6">magistrate judges cannot issue warrants</text>
  <text start="535.089" dur="8.071">for remote searches so the FBI under</text>
  <text start="539.89" dur="5.49">legal terms cannot go ahead and search</text>
  <text start="543.16" dur="5.19">computers but we know they&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="545.38" dur="5.61">using the legal way of doing it we know</text>
  <text start="548.35" dur="6.03">the FBI CIA NSA have been spying on</text>
  <text start="550.99" dur="5.73">everyone through different channels but</text>
  <text start="554.38" dur="5">this is making it legal for them to get</text>
  <text start="556.72" dur="7.17">a warrant and search computers and</text>
  <text start="559.38" dur="6.01">Senator Ron Weeden is out there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="563.89" dur="3.87">questioning</text>
  <text start="565.39" dur="5.22">this and saying that these amendments</text>
  <text start="567.76" dur="5.16">will have significant consequences for</text>
  <text start="570.61" dur="3.72">Americans privacy and the scope of the</text>
  <text start="572.92" dur="3.96">government&amp;#39;s power to conduct remote</text>
  <text start="574.33" dur="5.15">surveillances and searches of electronic</text>
  <text start="576.88" dur="5.31">devices he said under the proposed rules</text>
  <text start="579.48" dur="4.57">the government would be able to obtain a</text>
  <text start="582.19" dur="4.88">single warrant to access and search</text>
  <text start="584.05" dur="7.05">thousands or millions of computers at</text>
  <text start="587.07" dur="6.1">once and a vast majority of those</text>
  <text start="591.1" dur="4.47">computers are going to be searched we</text>
  <text start="593.17" dur="4.98">belong to the victims not the</text>
  <text start="595.57" dur="6.45">perpetrators of the cyber crime but this</text>
  <text start="598.15" dur="6.24">is exactly what they want they want the</text>
  <text start="602.02" dur="4.38">ability to say see it&amp;#39;s legal we have</text>
  <text start="604.39" dur="5.25">the right to search everyone&amp;#39;s computer</text>
  <text start="606.4" dur="5.22">in America now can I do that well that&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="609.64" dur="5.22">be very time consuming but they can</text>
  <text start="611.62" dur="6.69">pinpoint certain groups certain</text>
  <text start="614.86" dur="6.36">individuals because those people that</text>
  <text start="618.31" dur="4.71">are a threat to the authority of the</text>
  <text start="621.22" dur="3.15">government those are the people that</text>
  <text start="623.02" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re searching those are the people</text>
  <text start="624.37" dur="5.01">that they want to find out something</text>
  <text start="626.14" dur="6.09">about and we can see where we are headed</text>
  <text start="629.38" dur="5.28">at this point now out in North Korea we</text>
  <text start="632.23" dur="5.1">understand the US has been trying to</text>
  <text start="634.66" dur="8.57">provoke North Korea they&amp;#39;re also trying</text>
  <text start="637.33" dur="10.86">to provoke Russia China Iran Syria into</text>
  <text start="643.23" dur="7.96">war now on the Demilitarized Zone in</text>
  <text start="648.19" dur="7.35">South Korea North Korea they have</text>
  <text start="651.19" dur="7.62">reported that some of the South Korean</text>
  <text start="655.54" dur="6.06">soldiers they were aiming their guns at</text>
  <text start="658.81" dur="5.12">the north and they&amp;#39;re saying that US</text>
  <text start="661.6" dur="5.43">soldiers that were stationed there</text>
  <text start="663.93" dur="8.05">encouraged the South Korean soldiers to</text>
  <text start="667.03" dur="6.66">do this now the question is why would</text>
  <text start="671.98" dur="3.51">they want to go ahead and do this well</text>
  <text start="673.69" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re trying to provoke because if</text>
  <text start="675.49" dur="6">they all raised their weapons they were</text>
  <text start="678.16" dur="4.89">hoping that North Korea would raise</text>
  <text start="681.49" dur="3.9">their weapons and maybe someone made</text>
  <text start="683.05" dur="4.86">would make an accident and actually fire</text>

  <text start="739.21" dur="4.2">remove the sanctions but we understand</text>
  <text start="741.16" dur="4.23">why the u.s. is placing sanctions or</text>
  <text start="743.41" dur="4.83">wants to play sanctions because they</text>
  <text start="745.39" dur="5.04">didn&amp;#39;t get they didn&amp;#39;t get Ukraine they</text>

  <text start="760.75" dur="4.38">central bankers want the entire country</text>
  <text start="762.85" dur="5.19">of Ukraine and we see right now things</text>
  <text start="765.13" dur="5.91">are heating up there we know that the</text>
  <text start="768.04" dur="4.23">southeastern people went to Kiev and</text>
  <text start="771.04" dur="4.26">said listen let&amp;#39;s have a ceasefire</text>
  <text start="772.27" dur="5.31">during this Easter break Kiev agreed for</text>
  <text start="775.3" dur="4.86">the ceasefire and then Ukraine I mean</text>
  <text start="777.58" dur="4.38">then Kiev came out and said okay the</text>
  <text start="780.16" dur="4.65">southeastern people are breaking the</text>
  <text start="781.96" dur="4.56">ceasefire deal now this is kind of</text>
  <text start="784.81" dur="3.69">ridiculous because they&amp;#39;re the ones who</text>
  <text start="786.52" dur="4.02">proposed it they&amp;#39;re the ones who said</text>
  <text start="788.5" dur="4.41">let&amp;#39;s do this and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="790.54" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re continually provoking now NATO</text>
  <text start="792.91" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re going to be deploying additional</text>
  <text start="794.62" dur="5.49">four battalions of 4,000 troops in</text>
  <text start="796.96" dur="4.74">Poland and three Baltic states now this</text>
  <text start="800.11" dur="4.74">is coming from the US Deputy Secretary</text>
  <text start="801.7" dur="5.34">of Defense Robert work and the reason</text>
  <text start="804.85" dur="4.41">why they&amp;#39;re doing this of course it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="807.04" dur="6.87">Russian aggression but they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="809.26" dur="7.83">that Russia is continually moving closer</text>
  <text start="813.91" dur="6.8">and closer to their borders in their own</text>
  <text start="817.09" dur="6.33">country and having military drills</text>
  <text start="820.71" dur="4.75">that&amp;#39;s kind of weird it is their own</text>
  <text start="823.42" dur="3.54">country they&amp;#39;re inside of their country</text>
  <text start="825.46" dur="4.41">and they can go right up to the border</text>
  <text start="826.96" dur="5.97">can you imagine in the United States if</text>
  <text start="829.87" dur="6.44">the United States Armed Forces</text>
  <text start="832.93" dur="6.06">were inching closer to the border of</text>
  <text start="836.31" dur="6.07">Mexico or Canada and Mexico or Canada</text>
  <text start="838.99" dur="6.42">said okay now we need to get troops here</text>
  <text start="842.38" dur="6.18">because United States they have troops</text>
  <text start="845.41" dur="6.15">the National Guard inside the country</text>
  <text start="848.56" dur="4.64">very close to their borders oh that</text>
  <text start="851.56" dur="3.42">would make no sense whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="853.2" dur="3.759">people would look at that and scratch</text>
  <text start="854.98" dur="3.69">their head and say what whether we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="856.959" dur="3.961">our country we can have troops there we</text>
  <text start="858.67" dur="4.109">can have a base right at the border but</text>
  <text start="860.92" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re doing this for one reason and</text>
  <text start="862.779" dur="3.601">one reason only and that is to bring</text>
  <text start="864.52" dur="6.21">more military assets and more troops to</text>
  <text start="866.38" dur="5.91">this area now out in Egypt the u.s.</text>

  <text start="894.959" dur="4.391">there could be some type of coup</text>
  <text start="897.04" dur="4.26">happening there it looks like they might</text>
  <text start="899.35" dur="4.89">be getting ready to leave unleash</text>
  <text start="901.3" dur="4.32">something on Iran this is a scenario</text>
  <text start="904.24" dur="3.84">that we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch very</text>
  <text start="905.62" dur="5.159">very closely now a couple reports ago we</text>
  <text start="908.08" dur="5.19">talked about how the US was changing how</text>
  <text start="910.779" dur="6.841">they calculated how many civilians have</text>
  <text start="913.27" dur="8.55">died in bombings and we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="917.62" dur="9.03">the u.s. is picking up the bombing runs</text>
  <text start="921.82" dur="6.9">in Iraq and in Syria and the u.s. they</text>

  <text start="934.089" dur="5.311">completely unrealistic he goes let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="936.88" dur="5.84">just think about this for a second we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="939.4" dur="6.87">destroyed 6,000 buildings with over</text>

  <text start="1000.09" dur="4.68">we can see at this point that I know the</text>
  <text start="1002.67" dur="4.14">u.s. is out there blaming everything on</text>

  <text start="1081.27" dur="6.87">throughout the Middle East and as this</text>
  <text start="1085.41" dur="4.17">continues their only alternative is</text>
  <text start="1088.14" dur="3.54">going to start war because once they</text>
