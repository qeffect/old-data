  <text start="206.239" dur="6.36">right before the election their plan was</text>
  <text start="209.09" dur="6.209">to link the economy with Trump this way</text>
  <text start="212.599" dur="4.56">they can make the case that look he said</text>
  <text start="215.299" dur="6.241">he owned the stock market look he said</text>
  <text start="217.159" dur="8.431">he owned the economy it is his and the</text>
  <text start="221.54" dur="6.419">economy failed the problem is is that</text>
  <text start="225.59" dur="5.19">the plan has changed they just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="227.959" dur="6.721">know it they don&amp;#39;t realize that</text>
  <text start="230.78" dur="6.989">everything they were hoping to do has</text>
  <text start="234.68" dur="5.91">been stopped but they&amp;#39;re continuing on</text>
  <text start="237.769" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re not stopping with their</text>
  <text start="240.59" dur="4.95">narrative we&amp;#39;re going to be talking</text>
  <text start="242.239" dur="5.67">about that in just a minute but first I</text>
  <text start="245.54" dur="5.129">wanted to talk about what is really</text>
  <text start="247.909" dur="4.771">happening in the economy and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="250.669" dur="4.861">following the economy for quite a while</text>
  <text start="252.68" dur="4.41">and when I talk about the economy I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="255.53" dur="2.009">talking about the people&amp;#39;s economy am I</text>
  <text start="257.09" dur="3.509">talking about</text>
  <text start="257.539" dur="4.56">the numbers that Trump recites I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="260.599" dur="3.531">talking about the numbers the military</text>
  <text start="262.099" dur="4.011">media recites I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="264.13" dur="3.84">what is really happening here and this</text>
  <text start="266.11" dur="3.66">economy has been failing for a very long</text>
  <text start="267.97" dur="3.75">time it has nothing to do with Trump it</text>
  <text start="269.77" dur="3.66">has to do with the central bankers this</text>
  <text start="271.72" dur="5.01">economy was never meant to last this</text>
  <text start="273.43" dur="5.61">long and we&amp;#39;re seeing firsthand what</text>
  <text start="276.73" dur="4.29">happens to a central bank economy when</text>
  <text start="279.04" dur="4.62">it completely implodes on itself</text>
  <text start="281.02" dur="5.37">if you remove all stimulus and remove</text>
  <text start="283.66" dur="5.55">everything the central bankers have done</text>
  <text start="286.39" dur="5.4">and just let the economy do what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="289.21" dur="5.49">supposed to do in a free market the</text>
  <text start="291.79" dur="4.89">whole thing would collapse on itself I</text>
  <text start="294.7" dur="4.29">mean there&amp;#39;s no question about that</text>
  <text start="296.68" dur="4.16">if the central bank wasn&amp;#39;t out there</text>
  <text start="298.99" dur="4.86">manipulating the stock market</text>
  <text start="300.84" dur="6.1">manipulating the creation of currency</text>
  <text start="303.85" dur="5.97">manipulating the interest rates and the</text>
  <text start="306.94" dur="4.56">free market allowed and I should say the</text>
  <text start="309.82" dur="3.63">manipulation of gold and silver and the</text>
  <text start="311.5" dur="5.64">free market was allowed to do what it</text>
  <text start="313.45" dur="6.75">normally does adjust to what it should</text>
  <text start="317.14" dur="6.54">be the entire system would fall apart</text>
  <text start="320.2" dur="5.07">companies would go under now many people</text>
  <text start="323.68" dur="4.5">might say well that&amp;#39;s a good thing they</text>
  <text start="325.27" dur="6.59">saved all the companies well actually no</text>
  <text start="328.18" dur="6.9">because in the long run you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="331.86" dur="7.6">preventing the inevitable and as you go</text>
  <text start="335.08" dur="7.32">on preventing it over time it gets worse</text>
  <text start="339.46" dur="4.8">and worse and worse and before you know</text>
  <text start="342.4" dur="4.5">it instead of a small disaster you have</text>
  <text start="344.26" dur="4.35">a gigantic disaster and that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="346.9" dur="2.97">we&amp;#39;re headed right now a gigantic</text>
  <text start="348.61" dur="4.71">disastrous and when I talking about</text>
  <text start="349.87" dur="6.06">these numbers when I talk about what is</text>
  <text start="353.32" dur="5.4">going on in the economy it&amp;#39;s so you can</text>
  <text start="355.93" dur="4.65">be prepared for this transition remember</text>
  <text start="358.72" dur="4.05">the deep state the central banks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="360.58" dur="4.5">planning on bringing the system down</text>
  <text start="362.77" dur="4.29">they want this thing to crash they want</text>
  <text start="365.08" dur="3.66">it they want to blame it on Trump now if</text>
  <text start="367.06" dur="4.65">Trump wasn&amp;#39;t there and let&amp;#39;s say Clinton</text>
  <text start="368.74" dur="5.61">was there they would have just used an</text>
  <text start="371.71" dur="5.01">event to explain why the economy was</text>
  <text start="374.35" dur="4.53">going to crash they need the economy to</text>
  <text start="376.72" dur="4.26">crash because their system can&amp;#39;t last</text>
  <text start="378.88" dur="7.98">they need to cover it up one way or</text>
  <text start="380.98" dur="8.31">another but Trump the Patriots they are</text>
  <text start="386.86" dur="4.91">building a new system and there is going</text>
  <text start="389.29" dur="4.379">to be structure change in the Fed</text>
  <text start="391.77" dur="2.56">actually I believe the Fed is going to</text>
  <text start="393.669" dur="2.641">be taken over</text>
  <text start="394.33" dur="3.9">I believe the Fed is going to be audited</text>
  <text start="396.31" dur="4.41">and it&amp;#39;s going to be present</text>
  <text start="398.23" dur="4.59">to the world just like the d-class the</text>
  <text start="400.72" dur="5.28">d-class is going to be presented to the</text>
  <text start="402.82" dur="5.94">world at the right moment at the right</text>
  <text start="406" dur="5.28">moment Trump is going to present an</text>
  <text start="408.76" dur="4.92">audit to the people complete</text>
  <text start="411.28" dur="3.81">transparency this is what these</text>
  <text start="413.68" dur="5.19">individuals have been doing to our</text>
  <text start="415.09" dur="5.76">country and people at this point they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="418.87" dur="3.54">going to be very very angry so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="420.85" dur="5.85">look at some of the data that&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="422.41" dur="6.9">out adp they just reported and they said</text>
  <text start="426.7" dur="4.92">we&amp;#39;ve added 129 thousand jobs in march</text>
  <text start="429.31" dur="5.73">well below the expected one hundred and</text>
  <text start="431.62" dur="6.42">seventy five thousand and only just</text>
  <text start="435.04" dur="5.67">above the 125,000 lowest estimate of</text>
  <text start="438.04" dur="5.91">analysts this is the weakest growth in</text>
  <text start="440.71" dur="5.82">employment since September 2017 now</text>
  <text start="443.95" dur="5.55">under the hood small businesses shrank</text>
  <text start="446.53" dur="6.39">their employee base construction jobs</text>
  <text start="449.5" dur="5.88">lost about 6,000 jobs small businesses</text>
  <text start="452.92" dur="5.67">between 1 and 19 employees they lost</text>
  <text start="455.38" dur="5.33">about 9,000 people and when you go down</text>
  <text start="458.59" dur="4.62">the list you can see that there are</text>
  <text start="460.71" dur="6.07">different sectors that are losing jobs</text>
  <text start="463.21" dur="5.19">and this is to be expected with a</text>
  <text start="466.78" dur="4.35">central bank system that is</text>
  <text start="468.4" dur="5.04">deteriorating and falling apart they can</text>
  <text start="471.13" dur="5.22">manipulate the numbers just so far</text>
  <text start="473.44" dur="4.71">before these numbers really don&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="476.35" dur="3.72">any sense anymore I mean look at the</text>
  <text start="478.15" dur="4.47">automobile industry now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="480.07" dur="4.83">covering this for quite a while we we</text>
  <text start="482.62" dur="5.61">talked about channel stuffing where</text>
  <text start="484.9" dur="6.03">dealerships they receive cars those are</text>
  <text start="488.23" dur="6.87">counted as sales and they stuff the Lots</text>
  <text start="490.93" dur="6.93">to capacity and the manufacturers look</text>
  <text start="495.1" dur="4.65">like they&amp;#39;re manufacturing when the cars</text>
  <text start="497.86" dur="4.41">are delivered to the Lots it looks like</text>
  <text start="499.75" dur="5.4">sales and then they give them discounts</text>
  <text start="502.27" dur="4.74">to the people who are buying them and it</text>
  <text start="505.15" dur="4.77">looks like the automobile industry is</text>
  <text start="507.01" dur="5.7">doing fantastically but it&amp;#39;s not when we</text>
  <text start="509.92" dur="5.27">look at Auto Sales we see that the first</text>
  <text start="512.71" dur="4.92">quarter is absolutely horrible</text>
  <text start="515.19" dur="4.2">General Motors saw deliveries drop by</text>
  <text start="517.63" dur="5.94">seven percent</text>
  <text start="519.39" dur="8.68">fiat-chrysler their sales fell by 7.3</text>
  <text start="523.57" dur="8.01">percent Toyota sales fell by 3.5 percent</text>
  <text start="528.07" dur="7.8">Nissan sales fell by 5.3 percent</text>
  <text start="531.58" dur="7.44">Ford their sales fell by 5% Honda 4.3%</text>
  <text start="535.87" dur="5.34">now it&amp;#39;s not because of Trump it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="539.02" dur="3.81">because of the tariffs we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="541.21" dur="3.54">following this and there&amp;#39;s a reason why</text>
  <text start="542.83" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;ve been following this so we can</text>
  <text start="544.75" dur="6.6">understand what is happening we&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="547.66" dur="6.93">on the same trajectory of where we were</text>
  <text start="551.35" dur="7.91">back with Obama nothing&amp;#39;s really changed</text>
  <text start="554.59" dur="7.8">what has changed is that Trump is</text>
  <text start="559.26" dur="5.59">deregulating Trump is making deals with</text>
  <text start="562.39" dur="5.01">manufacturers and businesses trying to</text>
  <text start="564.85" dur="4.58">bring back everything the deep state the</text>
  <text start="567.4" dur="5.58">central banks have been pushing away</text>
  <text start="569.43" dur="5.56">that&amp;#39;s the big difference because Trump</text>
  <text start="572.98" dur="5.16">of the Patriots they know they need to</text>
  <text start="574.99" dur="5.34">create a system for the people because</text>
  <text start="578.14" dur="4.65">they realize we&amp;#39;re not going to have a</text>
  <text start="580.33" dur="5.1">war the system is collapsing</text>
  <text start="582.79" dur="5.58">the central bank is exposed and we need</text>
  <text start="585.43" dur="5.46">to transition into something else that</text>
  <text start="588.37" dur="5.39">does not include the private western</text>
  <text start="590.89" dur="6.36">central bank it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="593.76" dur="5.35">controlled people&amp;#39;s central bank which</text>
  <text start="597.25" dur="5.13">means we&amp;#39;re going to create our currency</text>
  <text start="599.11" dur="5.82">on our own without interest attached I</text>
  <text start="602.38" dur="4.32">mean we can push a button the same as</text>
  <text start="604.93" dur="4.17">the Federal Reserve there&amp;#39;s really no</text>
  <text start="606.7" dur="4.47">difference there and they&amp;#39;re managing of</text>
  <text start="609.1" dur="3.93">the economy means manipulating of the</text>
  <text start="611.17" dur="4.02">economy when they talk about well who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="613.03" dur="3.54">going to manage the economy well are</text>
  <text start="615.19" dur="3.03">they really managing it or are they</text>
  <text start="616.57" dur="3.9">manipulating it they&amp;#39;re controlling</text>
  <text start="618.22" dur="4.89">interest rates they&amp;#39;re manipulating the</text>
  <text start="620.47" dur="4.74">stock market they&amp;#39;re manipulating where</text>
  <text start="623.11" dur="6.17">the money flows to they&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="625.21" dur="7.02">managing it they&amp;#39;re protecting it so</text>
  <text start="629.28" dur="6.76">they&amp;#39;re not exposed that&amp;#39;s all they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="632.23" dur="5.7">doing and we can do the same the</text>
  <text start="636.04" dur="3.78">founding fathers in the Constitution</text>
  <text start="637.93" dur="4.19">they never said hey bring in a private</text>
  <text start="639.82" dur="4.92">western central bank to manager economy</text>
  <text start="642.12" dur="4.81">that was created by the central bank</text>
  <text start="644.74" dur="6.24">then brainwashed all of us into thinking</text>
  <text start="646.93" dur="7.5">debt is fantastic now we know that Trump</text>
  <text start="650.98" dur="5.28">has controlled the Fed to stop raising</text>
  <text start="654.43" dur="5.75">interest rates they&amp;#39;re not raising rates</text>
  <text start="656.26" dur="8.76">in 2019 and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="660.18" dur="7.24">interest rates they are either steady</text>
  <text start="665.02" dur="4.29">or in some cases mortgage rates are</text>
  <text start="667.42" dur="4.14">starting to dip down a little bit and</text>
  <text start="669.31" dur="5.55">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>

  <text start="704.23" dur="3.63">rate which will make it a little bit</text>
  <text start="706.03" dur="4.08">easier for them to pay their mortgage</text>

  <text start="865.869" dur="4.621">went ahead and they didn&amp;#39;t raise</text>
  <text start="868.119" dur="4.47">interest rates because they realized</text>
  <text start="870.49" dur="4.17">what was happening in the economy so</text>
  <text start="872.589" dur="5.04">they decided to stop it now if you</text>
  <text start="874.66" dur="5.25">remember back the IMF was actually out</text>
  <text start="877.629" dur="3.93">there telling the Federal Reserve listen</text>
  <text start="879.91" dur="4.679">you shouldn&amp;#39;t raise interest rates this</text>
  <text start="881.559" dur="4.38">is going to hurt the economy and then</text>
  <text start="884.589" dur="3.84">all of a sudden they changed their tune</text>
  <text start="885.939" dur="3.96">and said okay it&amp;#39;s a good thing that the</text>
  <text start="888.429" dur="3.361">Fed is raising the rates because they</text>
  <text start="889.899" dur="4.141">got the memo that they were planning on</text>
  <text start="891.79" dur="4.889">bringing down the system so the IMF was</text>

  <text start="900.49" dur="4.409">economy down and of course all of this</text>
  <text start="903.49" dur="2.189">was going to be done to blame it on</text>
  <text start="904.899" dur="3.48">something else</text>
  <text start="905.679" dur="6">most likely Trump so what did they do</text>
  <text start="908.379" dur="5.611">right now the Patriots told the Fed</text>
  <text start="911.679" dur="5.611">listen do not raise interest rates I</text>
  <text start="913.99" dur="5.339">mean if we go back to post 25 75 this is</text>
  <text start="917.29" dur="4.139">what q said that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="919.329" dur="4.92">control this it has already been planned</text>
  <text start="921.429" dur="3.6">for so the Patriots stopped the Fed from</text>
  <text start="924.249" dur="4.26">raising rates</text>
  <text start="925.029" dur="4.98">now the IMF is trying to make the case</text>
  <text start="928.509" dur="3.211">and the Washington Post is out there</text>
  <text start="930.009" dur="3.011">trying to make the case that that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="931.72" dur="4.66">that&amp;#39;s left</text>
  <text start="933.02" dur="6.24">is Trump and his tariffs now we talked</text>
  <text start="936.38" dur="7.77">about tariffs before tariffs do</text>
  <text start="939.26" dur="7.68">absolutely nothing it&amp;#39;s not what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="944.15" dur="6.92">telling you it&amp;#39;s not that Oh the prices</text>
  <text start="946.94" dur="7.59">are going to rise because the tariff</text>
  <text start="951.07" dur="5.38">percentage is on the first sale and</text>
  <text start="954.53" dur="4.89">usually that&amp;#39;s with a middleman that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="956.45" dur="7.62">when the products are the cheapest so</text>
  <text start="959.42" dur="8.4">most likely in that scenario Americans</text>
  <text start="964.07" dur="6.05">won&amp;#39;t even notice a change and the</text>
  <text start="967.82" dur="6.66">tariffs are not going to bring down the</text>
  <text start="970.12" dur="7.3">economy they&amp;#39;re building this up because</text>
  <text start="974.48" dur="5.64">they still think they&amp;#39;re on the same</text>
  <text start="977.42" dur="6.57">plan that the economy is going to be</text>
  <text start="980.12" dur="9.54">coming down in 2020 Trump I mean Europe</text>
  <text start="983.99" dur="7.67">might fail during 2020 they might see</text>
  <text start="989.66" dur="5.55">problems like we&amp;#39;ve never seen before</text>
  <text start="991.66" dur="5.32">Trump through manipulation using all the</text>
  <text start="995.21" dur="5.63">tools against the central bank in the</text>
  <text start="996.98" dur="7.11">deep state he will keep America strong</text>

  <text start="1004.09" dur="4.52">looking fantastic</text>
  <text start="1005.31" dur="8.2">so the United States will stand tall and</text>
  <text start="1008.61" dur="8.17">Europe might be failing we might see the</text>
  <text start="1013.51" dur="6.45">emerging markets failing but the United</text>
  <text start="1016.78" dur="5.55">States is going to stand tall he has the</text>
  <text start="1019.96" dur="5.42">magic wand he has the ability to</text>
  <text start="1022.33" dur="7.05">manipulate does this mean the economy is</text>
  <text start="1025.38" dur="6.97">going to stay the way it is no they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1029.38" dur="5.4">planning on a change the change is going</text>
  <text start="1032.35" dur="4.77">to come after the elections the change</text>
  <text start="1034.78" dur="4.97">is going to be when the deep state and</text>
