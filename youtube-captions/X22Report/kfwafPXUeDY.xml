  <text start="223.79" dur="6.39">more bad loans and it is accelerating it</text>
  <text start="226.88" dur="7.5">is not slowed down the reason for this</text>

  <text start="234.38" dur="6.51">in the property sector and the loans</text>
  <text start="237.02" dur="7.59">have completely gone through this phase</text>
  <text start="240.89" dur="5.67">of re-accelerate amis are all bad loans</text>
  <text start="244.61" dur="5.28">they are at an all-time record high of</text>
  <text start="246.56" dur="6.899">12 point six eight percent and this is</text>
  <text start="249.89" dur="5.58">not looking good for spain and again</text>
  <text start="253.459" dur="5.491">with high unemployment in the double</text>
  <text start="255.47" dur="5.43">digits massive amount of debt how are</text>
  <text start="258.95" dur="4.71">people supposed to afford their homes</text>
  <text start="260.9" dur="5.91">they can&amp;#39;t and this is why you&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="263.66" dur="5.31">bad loans and what a country&amp;#39;s normally</text>
  <text start="266.81" dur="5.7">do they try to tax the people that are</text>
  <text start="268.97" dur="3.87">still working to cover the loss of those</text>
  <text start="272.51" dur="2.55">who</text>
  <text start="272.84" dur="4.29">are not working but I guess what that</text>
  <text start="275.06" dur="6.03">doesn&amp;#39;t work either because you can just</text>
  <text start="277.13" dur="6.12">tax them so much that after a while they</text>
  <text start="281.09" dur="4.35">can&amp;#39;t you know they can&amp;#39;t live they</text>
  <text start="283.25" dur="4.47">can&amp;#39;t continue what they&amp;#39;re doing and</text>
  <text start="285.44" dur="4.71">the country eventually needs to go and</text>
  <text start="287.72" dur="7.169">borrow more money and we&amp;#39;re seeing this</text>
  <text start="290.15" dur="7.35">in France I mean they have text the</text>
  <text start="294.889" dur="5.101">wealthy they did an increase in the VAT</text>
  <text start="297.5" dur="5.55">and other tax revenues and guess what</text>
  <text start="299.99" dur="4.95">they cannot keep up with the amount of</text>
  <text start="303.05" dur="4.47">interest on the debt and all the</text>
  <text start="304.94" dur="6.27">programs they have going they fell short</text>
  <text start="307.52" dur="7.61">of 5.5 billion dollars and this just</text>
  <text start="311.21" dur="8.19">goes to show you this system that</text>
  <text start="315.13" dur="6.49">everyone is using does not work high</text>
  <text start="319.4" dur="5.639">unemployment massive amount of debt</text>
  <text start="321.62" dur="5.94">interest on the debt taxing the people</text>
  <text start="325.039" dur="4.471">who are still working cannot keep the</text>
  <text start="327.56" dur="4.44">country going whatsoever so what do</text>
  <text start="329.51" dur="6.17">these countries do they decide to ask</text>
  <text start="332" dur="6.419">for more money so they borrow more money</text>
  <text start="335.68" dur="6.66">that gives them more debt gives them</text>
  <text start="338.419" dur="6.661">higher interest payments and guess what</text>
  <text start="342.34" dur="4.9">they still can&amp;#39;t need the higher</text>
  <text start="345.08" dur="3.66">interest payments because the tax</text>
  <text start="347.24" dur="3.87">revenue that was coming in before it</text>
  <text start="348.74" dur="5.13">couldn&amp;#39;t meet the previous interest</text>
  <text start="351.11" dur="4.05">payments so you know they say okay then</text>
  <text start="353.87" dur="3.33">we&amp;#39;re going to have to cut expenses and</text>
  <text start="355.16" dur="4.56">they start laying off people in the</text>
  <text start="357.2" dur="5.16">government so now people have their less</text>
  <text start="359.72" dur="9.35">people working in the government to give</text>
  <text start="362.36" dur="9.86">to which will add revenue to the to the</text>
  <text start="369.07" dur="7.029">country and it just cannot be sustained</text>
  <text start="372.22" dur="6.85">it&amp;#39;s impossible here in the US it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="376.099" dur="4.891">little different the Fed creates the</text>
  <text start="379.07" dur="3.36">money out of thin air and loans it to</text>
  <text start="380.99" dur="5.04">the government and they continually do</text>
  <text start="382.43" dur="5.459">this but if you really look the US is</text>
  <text start="386.03" dur="4.44">still running into the same problem the</text>
  <text start="387.889" dur="4.561">debt is getting way too high and so what</text>
  <text start="390.47" dur="5.25">are they doing they are going and</text>
  <text start="392.45" dur="5.31">looking for any type of tax revenue they</text>
  <text start="395.72" dur="3.66">can they&amp;#39;re looking overseas they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="397.76" dur="4.49">looking within the country to tax more</text>
  <text start="399.38" dur="5.73">people and if you look at Obamacare</text>
  <text start="402.25" dur="4.12">that&amp;#39;s why there&amp;#39;s a penalty on the</text>
  <text start="405.11" dur="1.65">insurance because that&amp;#39;s supposed to</text>
  <text start="406.37" dur="3.24">raise</text>
  <text start="406.76" dur="5.21">about 200 billion worth of tax revenue</text>
  <text start="409.61" dur="5.1">there&amp;#39;s also a three point eight percent</text>
  <text start="411.97" dur="5.62">tax on people who are selling their</text>
  <text start="414.71" dur="5.16">homes and that&amp;#39;s going to raise tax</text>
  <text start="417.59" dur="4.53">revenue and they are doing this all over</text>
  <text start="419.87" dur="4.62">they even want to put there&amp;#39;s a bill out</text>
  <text start="422.12" dur="4.26">there that for every trade that goes on</text>
  <text start="424.49" dur="4.05">in the stock market they want to put a</text>
  <text start="426.38" dur="6.06">tax on that they wanted to do an online</text>
  <text start="428.54" dur="6.69">tax its tax tax tax tax this is all you</text>
  <text start="432.44" dur="5.43">see because they can&amp;#39;t support the debt</text>
  <text start="435.23" dur="5.37">and they need to tax those who are still</text>
  <text start="437.87" dur="4.53">working but guess what if we keep going</text>
  <text start="440.6" dur="4.74">the way we&amp;#39;re going and I did this in my</text>
  <text start="442.4" dur="5.97">report about you know three four five</text>
  <text start="445.34" dur="4.98">reports ago in the next four years if we</text>
  <text start="448.37" dur="4.53">keep keep going the way we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="450.32" dur="6.48">there going to be more people out of</text>
  <text start="452.9" dur="7.23">work than there are people working so</text>
  <text start="456.8" dur="5.76">this cannot work so what do they need to</text>
  <text start="460.13" dur="5.4">do well the central bankers know this</text>
  <text start="462.56" dur="6.15">the US government knows this this is why</text>
  <text start="465.53" dur="5.1">they will create the next false flag to</text>
  <text start="468.71" dur="4.23">get the war started because they need to</text>
  <text start="470.63" dur="4.74">keep everyone&amp;#39;s attention off of the</text>
  <text start="472.94" dur="4.26">collapse and who&amp;#39;s responsible for the</text>
  <text start="475.37" dur="3.99">collapse so what they do is they move</text>
  <text start="477.2" dur="4.2">everyone&amp;#39;s attention to someplace else</text>
  <text start="479.36" dur="4.53">and that is exactly what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="481.4" dur="3.96">to do here in America what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="483.89" dur="5.04">is the National Association of</text>

  <text start="908.04" dur="7.08">phone tracking complaint and you have to</text>
  <text start="912.18" dur="5.67">think is the Supreme Court being</text>
  <text start="915.12" dur="4.74">blackmailed by the NSA because you have</text>
  <text start="917.85" dur="6.18">to remember the NSA is capturing all the</text>

  <text start="924.03" dur="4.38">intercept everything so you know they</text>
  <text start="926.19" dur="4.95">have something on the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="928.41" dur="4.53">members and this is of course what the</text>
  <text start="931.14" dur="3.93">NSA is doing is completely in violation</text>
  <text start="932.94" dur="4.649">of the Fourth Amendment doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="935.07" dur="6.18">how they spin it they are but if you</text>
  <text start="937.589" dur="6.331">notice the Supreme Court always backs</text>
  <text start="941.25" dur="4.35">down and what this goes on to say is the</text>
  <text start="943.92" dur="4.17">Supreme Court announced Monday morning</text>
  <text start="945.6" dur="4.62">that it would not be considering at this</text>
  <text start="948.09" dur="4.11">time a complaint filed months earlier</text>

  <text start="962.24" dur="4.93">they&amp;#39;re not even going forward with this</text>
  <text start="964.77" dur="4.68">or taking it to the next level and this</text>
  <text start="967.17" dur="4.8">just makes me think that the NSA is</text>
  <text start="969.45" dur="6.99">completely and totally blackmailing the</text>
  <text start="971.97" dur="7.14">people on the Supreme Court now don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="976.44" dur="6.54">worry everyone because since they can</text>
  <text start="979.11" dur="7.98">continually spy on everyone the the FBI</text>
  <text start="982.98" dur="6.96">has a new cell phone spying device which</text>
  <text start="987.09" dur="5.37">removes all privacy now how does this</text>
  <text start="989.94" dur="4.8">device its code name is stingray it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="992.46" dur="5.61">also known as triggerfish ims</text>
  <text start="994.74" dur="6.54">eye-catcher cell sites simulator or</text>
  <text start="998.07" dur="5.91">digital analyzer and this is a</text>
  <text start="1001.28" dur="5.1">sophisticated portable spy device able</text>
  <text start="1003.98" dur="5.28">to track cell phone signals inside</text>
  <text start="1006.38" dur="6.45">vehicles homes insulated buildings it</text>
  <text start="1009.26" dur="6.84">doesn&amp;#39;t really matter the device acts as</text>
  <text start="1012.83" dur="5.73">a fake cell tower allowing police</text>
  <text start="1016.1" dur="5.58">investigators to pinpoint location of a</text>
  <text start="1018.56" dur="6.17">targeted wireless mobile by sucking up</text>
  <text start="1021.68" dur="8.13">phone data such as text messages emails</text>
  <text start="1024.73" dur="7.15">cell site information and this is how it</text>
  <text start="1029.81" dur="4.16">works when a suspect makes a phone call</text>
  <text start="1031.88" dur="4.709">the Stingray tricks the cell into</text>
  <text start="1033.97" dur="4.719">sending its signal back to the police</text>
  <text start="1036.589" dur="3.99">thus preventing the signal from</text>
  <text start="1038.689" dur="4.741">traveling back to the suspects wireless</text>
  <text start="1040.579" dur="5.581">carrier but not only does stingray track</text>
  <text start="1043.43" dur="4.8">the target a cell phone it also extracts</text>
  <text start="1046.16" dur="5.13">data off potentially thousands of other</text>
  <text start="1048.23" dur="5.46">cell phone users in the area and come</text>
  <text start="1051.29" dur="4.26">and right now you know they don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="1053.69" dur="3.48">problem with this whatsoever they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1055.55" dur="4.59">believe this is in violation of the</text>
  <text start="1057.17" dur="5.7">Fourth Amendment and this was originally</text>
  <text start="1060.14" dur="5.4">intended for terrorism but instead</text>
  <text start="1062.87" dur="4.34">they&amp;#39;re using it on the people inside</text>
  <text start="1065.54" dur="6.2">America</text>
  <text start="1067.21" dur="6.63">and they are tracking everyone&amp;#39;s cell</text>
  <text start="1071.74" dur="3.75">phone they are using this device and</text>
  <text start="1073.84" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re saying they don&amp;#39;t need a warrant</text>
  <text start="1075.49" dur="4.5">to do this at all which I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="1078.49" dur="4.049">I remember in the past if you had a</text>
  <text start="1079.99" dur="5.7">landline type of system they always</text>
  <text start="1082.539" dur="6.091">needed a search warrant to listen to a</text>
  <text start="1085.69" dur="7.16">call to get any information oh let me</text>
  <text start="1088.63" dur="4.22">say if they need information from a</text>
  <text start="1093.24" dur="6.25">phone carrier they need to get a search</text>
  <text start="1096.73" dur="6.15">warrant and the phone carrier gives them</text>
  <text start="1099.49" dur="9.51">the information so why is this above the</text>
  <text start="1102.88" dur="8.94">law makes no sense to me now the TSA is</text>
  <text start="1109" dur="4.83">going to make it easier for everyone in</text>
  <text start="1111.82" dur="4.5">the airport no they&amp;#39;re not I&amp;#39;m kidding</text>
  <text start="1113.83" dur="5.91">there they have created these new</text>
  <text start="1116.32" dur="6.599">detention pods and what this does is</text>
  <text start="1119.74" dur="6.45">this will be in all major airports</text>
  <text start="1122.919" dur="5.51">before you know it as you&amp;#39;re walking out</text>
  <text start="1126.19" dur="6.27">of the airport they will temporarily</text>
  <text start="1128.429" dur="7.151">temporarily hold you in a pod it looks</text>
  <text start="1132.46" dur="5.339">like one of those rotating doors that</text>
  <text start="1135.58" dur="6.15">swing around and it just stops and</text>
  <text start="1137.799" dur="6.151">trapped you inside and it keeps you</text>
  <text start="1141.73" dur="6.21">there for a certain amount of minutes</text>
  <text start="1143.95" dur="7.38">and when they feel that it&amp;#39;s all clear</text>
  <text start="1147.94" dur="5.459">the there&amp;#39;s an electronic voice and it</text>
  <text start="1151.33" dur="4.589">gives them it gives whoever&amp;#39;s in the pod</text>
  <text start="1153.399" dur="7.231">permission to leave so basically</text>
  <text start="1155.919" dur="7.11">everyone is a threat now to the national</text>
  <text start="1160.63" dur="5.31">security because as you&amp;#39;re leaving you</text>
  <text start="1163.029" dur="4.681">will be held in this pod and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1165.94" dur="3.81">know what the pod does why you&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="1167.71" dur="4.05">held in there and then the voice says</text>
  <text start="1169.75" dur="6.6">okay you&amp;#39;re free to go so you&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="1171.76" dur="7.44">jailed and then let go again this is</text>
  <text start="1176.35" dur="5.819">against all of my rights and I am being</text>
  <text start="1179.2" dur="4.62">detained at this time but it seems like</text>
  <text start="1182.169" dur="5.13">no one has a problem with this and again</text>
  <text start="1183.82" dur="10.579">this is a violation of every single</text>

  <text start="1257.93" dur="6.45">central bank countries are all trying to</text>

  <text start="1274.46" dur="7.26">they are all trying to get into the</text>
  <text start="1277.28" dur="8.69">African nations and right now the China</text>
  <text start="1281.72" dur="7.71">will provide one trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="1285.97" dur="5.29">financing to Africa at this time and</text>
  <text start="1289.43" dur="4.41">what they went on to say is we have</text>
  <text start="1291.26" dur="5.34">plenty of money to spend we have the</text>

  <text start="1296.6" dur="7.62">3.5 trillion of reserves of US dollars</text>
  <text start="1299.63" dur="7.77">and we just cannot buy US Treasury so</text>
  <text start="1304.22" dur="8.24">what is that tell you that they rather</text>
  <text start="1307.4" dur="5.06">take the US dollars and purchase</text>
  <text start="1312.73" dur="7.99">interest in the African nation instead</text>
  <text start="1316.76" dur="5.97">of buying more Treasury bonds so this</text>
  <text start="1320.72" dur="5.34">just goes to show you they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1322.73" dur="6.75">get rid of their dollars by investing it</text>
  <text start="1326.06" dur="6.57">into Africa and right now the US has</text>

  <text start="1340.82" dur="4.68">natural resources but what is</text>
  <text start="1342.53" dur="6.9">interesting about this is that china is</text>
  <text start="1345.5" dur="6.09">using the US dollar in Africa to build</text>
  <text start="1349.43" dur="5.46">you know roadways to build up their</text>

  <text start="1415.76" dur="6">been signed and signed including those</text>
  <text start="1418.88" dur="7.35">on air defense system and they might</text>
  <text start="1421.76" dur="6.33">even ask Russia for additional aid so we</text>
  <text start="1426.23" dur="5.31">can see what is happening right now we</text>
  <text start="1428.09" dur="6.03">each of the same bye-bye us hello Russia</text>
  <text start="1431.54" dur="4.83">Saudi Arabia&amp;#39;s doing the same exact</text>
  <text start="1434.12" dur="4.05">thing they&amp;#39;re in talks with Putin there</text>
  <text start="1436.37" dur="5.31">were also making deals with China and we</text>
  <text start="1438.17" dur="5.7">see many other nations doing this Turkey</text>
  <text start="1441.68" dur="5.34">was looking to body the Chinese missiles</text>
  <text start="1443.87" dur="5.43">but NATO in the u.s. put a huge amount</text>
  <text start="1447.02" dur="6.12">of pressure on Turkey and they backed</text>
  <text start="1449.3" dur="7.59">away from that and like I said in my</text>
  <text start="1453.14" dur="7.31">other reports the US is losing control</text>
  <text start="1456.89" dur="6.36">of the Middle East right now Libya is</text>
  <text start="1460.45" dur="6.13">having major problems and I&amp;#39;ve said this</text>
  <text start="1463.25" dur="7.11">before you will know when it is a threat</text>
  <text start="1466.58" dur="7.219">to the US dollar and the way you&amp;#39;ll know</text>
  <text start="1470.36" dur="8.01">this is the US will send troops over and</text>
  <text start="1473.799" dur="7.12">here we are in Libya they feel there is</text>
  <text start="1478.37" dur="6.059">a threat to the US dollar as the reserve</text>
  <text start="1480.919" dur="5.701">currency selling the Libyan oil and we</text>
  <text start="1484.429" dur="3.961">understand that the militants have taken</text>
  <text start="1486.62" dur="4.59">over some of the oil fields they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1488.39" dur="5.159">stopping production so what is the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1491.21" dur="5.01">central bankers do and they always do</text>
  <text start="1493.549" dur="7.941">this this is stage one they are sending</text>
  <text start="1496.22" dur="9.329">in the troops to train the Libyan forces</text>
  <text start="1501.49" dur="7.919">we know what they are doing they are</text>
  <text start="1505.549" dur="7.35">sending in and establishing military</text>
  <text start="1509.409" dur="6.071">presence in the region because</text>
  <text start="1512.899" dur="6.78">eventually when the fighting continues</text>
  <text start="1515.48" dur="7.59">and escalates guess what the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1519.679" dur="8.191">already has troops there they did this</text>
  <text start="1523.07" dur="7.17">prior to the Syrian event where they</text>
  <text start="1527.87" dur="6.11">brought in all the warships and the</text>
  <text start="1530.24" dur="7.35">aircraft carriers they brought over</text>
  <text start="1533.98" dur="7.09">tanks missiles troops to Jordan and they</text>
  <text start="1537.59" dur="5.85">said this was for a drill and they left</text>
  <text start="1541.07" dur="6.3">them there because they knew those were</text>
  <text start="1543.44" dur="6.03">going to be used for the Syrian strike</text>
  <text start="1547.37" dur="4.019">which actually never happened but there</text>
  <text start="1549.47" dur="4.199">is in preparation they are doing the</text>
  <text start="1551.389" dur="6.03">same thing in Libya they realized there</text>
  <text start="1553.669" dur="5.76">is a huge threat to the US dollar so</text>
  <text start="1557.419" dur="4.681">they are moving in troops right now and</text>
  <text start="1559.429" dur="5.821">using the illusion that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1562.1" dur="5.939">train the Libyan forces and eventually</text>
  <text start="1565.25" dur="6.059">this will get out of hand and the war</text>
  <text start="1568.039" dur="6.75">will begin and the fighting will start</text>
  <text start="1571.309" dur="9.631">and more and more troops will arrive in</text>
  <text start="1574.789" dur="7.74">Libya okay now like I said the United</text>
  <text start="1580.94" dur="3.27">States central bankers are losing</text>

  <text start="1608.69" dur="6.54">happened with Syria and this whole thing</text>
  <text start="1612.13" dur="4.99">is completely falling apart in the</text>
  <text start="1615.23" dur="4.53">Middle East for the central bankers but</text>
  <text start="1617.12" dur="6.059">we know they are planning a major major</text>

  <text start="1623.179" dur="3.451">people know about this because you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1625.25" dur="4.2">want to blurt this out that it is a</text>
  <text start="1626.63" dur="6.57">false flag event so they are trying to</text>
  <text start="1629.45" dur="7.05">keep everything as status quo until the</text>
  <text start="1633.2" dur="7.7">event occurs but until that time they</text>
  <text start="1636.5" dur="7.799">are totally losing control in the region</text>
  <text start="1640.9" dur="5.649">now there is leaked information and this</text>
  <text start="1644.299" dur="4.981">is all part of the propaganda for the</text>
  <text start="1646.549" dur="5.611">false flag event elite information from</text>
  <text start="1649.28" dur="6.96">an Iranian dissident has reported that</text>
  <text start="1652.16" dur="6.48">Iran has built a secret nuclear site and</text>
  <text start="1656.24" dur="5.16">exiled Iranian opposition group said on</text>

  <text start="1663.53" dur="7.1">iran and that this was among a number of</text>
  <text start="1667.04" dur="9.57">secret venues for an atomic bomb program</text>
  <text start="1670.63" dur="8.049">this right here is they build up to the</text>
  <text start="1676.61" dur="3.54">next false flag if you notice every</text>
  <text start="1678.679" dur="6.12">single time I&amp;#39;m reporting on this</text>
  <text start="1680.15" dur="8.279">there&amp;#39;s more news about a new threat</text>
  <text start="1684.799" dur="7.311">from Iran or from al-qaeda or from other</text>
  <text start="1688.429" dur="5.851">organizations or about cyber attacks and</text>
  <text start="1692.11" dur="3.52">right now then let me just read this</text>
  <text start="1694.28" dur="2.85">this goes on to say that according to</text>
  <text start="1695.63" dur="4.53">specific information obtained by the</text>
  <text start="1697.13" dur="6.15">Iranian resistance the clerical regime</text>
  <text start="1700.16" dur="4.98">is establishing a completing parallel</text>
  <text start="1703.28" dur="4.769">secret and undeclared sites for its</text>
  <text start="1705.14" dur="4.56">nuclear project and this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1708.049" dur="3.961">going to use to say that&amp;#39;s how they</text>
  <text start="1709.7" dur="4.44">created a nuclear weapon this is how was</text>
  <text start="1712.01" dur="4.95">delivered to the US and this is how the</text>
  <text start="1714.14" dur="5.73">full slide will occur but let&amp;#39;s move on</text>
  <text start="1716.96" dur="4.17">how are they setting all this up to work</text>
  <text start="1719.87" dur="3.809">in their benefit and you have to</text>
  <text start="1721.13" dur="4.83">understand they need to get into Iran</text>
  <text start="1723.679" dur="3.99">and Syria and overthrow the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1725.96" dur="3.599">there that&amp;#39;s their main objective to</text>
  <text start="1727.669" dur="4.351">place the US dollar as the reserve</text>
  <text start="1729.559" dur="4.581">currency so what do we see happen over</text>
  <text start="1732.02" dur="7.91">the weekend in Syria well we saw the</text>
  <text start="1734.14" dur="9.06">rebels bomb a building that contained 31</text>
  <text start="1739.93" dur="6.15">troops and three generals and a</text>
  <text start="1743.2" dur="5.55">brigadier general and they all died in</text>
  <text start="1746.08" dur="5.1">the bomb attack and right now this goes</text>
  <text start="1748.75" dur="4.11">on to say there is a speculation that</text>
  <text start="1751.18" dur="4.02">rebels could have infiltrated the</text>
  <text start="1752.86" dur="4.26">military base as the explosive device</text>
  <text start="1755.2" dur="4.29">was probably placed either inside or</text>
  <text start="1757.12" dur="5.13">beneath the building in a tunnel because</text>
  <text start="1759.49" dur="5.13">I if you watch the ville the building</text>
  <text start="1762.25" dur="4.35">collapse it looks like it was a planned</text>
  <text start="1764.62" dur="4.59">demolition actually and the building</text>
  <text start="1766.6" dur="4.47">just came crumbling down and I do have a</text>
  <text start="1769.21" dur="3.15">video on that on centinall alert so if</text>
  <text start="1771.07" dur="3.75">you go and set an alert just scroll down</text>
  <text start="1772.36" dur="6.81">until you find the video and you can see</text>
  <text start="1774.82" dur="7.35">the building come crashing down so</text>
  <text start="1779.17" dur="5.28">already they&amp;#39;re removing top generals a</text>
  <text start="1782.17" dur="6.51">brigadier general a lot of troops</text>
  <text start="1784.45" dur="6.36">because again they need the ability to</text>
  <text start="1788.68" dur="5.07">get in there and overthrow it with sod</text>
  <text start="1790.81" dur="4.62">and using a strike it will make it a lot</text>
  <text start="1793.75" dur="3.57">easier if they can get rid of these</text>
  <text start="1795.43" dur="4.82">people ahead of time and this is all</text>
  <text start="1797.32" dur="6.12">playing into the next false flag event</text>
  <text start="1800.25" dur="5.08">so what are the Gulf states doing to</text>
  <text start="1803.44" dur="4.08">prepare for this well they know</text>
  <text start="1805.33" dur="4.95">something&amp;#39;s going to happen they realize</text>
  <text start="1807.52" dur="5.88">that something will happen so right now</text>
  <text start="1810.28" dur="5.76">the Gulf states aim or is to integrate</text>
  <text start="1813.4" dur="4.86">their air defense system to meet threats</text>
  <text start="1816.04" dur="3.96">from ballistic and cruise missiles and</text>
  <text start="1818.26" dur="3.57">this goes on to say they&amp;#39;re creating a</text>
  <text start="1820" dur="3.99">missile defense shield to kill ballistic</text>
  <text start="1821.83" dur="4.95">or cruise missiles before they are over</text>
  <text start="1823.99" dur="5.01">land and this is critical importance</text>
  <text start="1826.78" dur="4.14">they went on to say the plan is for the</text>
  <text start="1829" dur="4.08">Gulf to have an integrated missile</text>
  <text start="1830.92" dur="4.95">system each country is putting together</text>
  <text start="1833.08" dur="4.74">its own anti air defense system which</text>
  <text start="1835.87" dur="4.05">will go grow eventually toward a</text>
  <text start="1837.82" dur="4.11">regional integrated system we&amp;#39;re hoping</text>
  <text start="1839.92" dur="5.25">this can be settled within the next</text>
  <text start="1841.93" dur="4.68">three to five years and they are</text>
  <text start="1845.17" dur="6.12">definitely getting prepared because they</text>
  <text start="1846.61" dur="7.62">understand as time goes on World War II</text>
  <text start="1851.29" dur="5.46">will develop and again if you have to</text>
  <text start="1854.23" dur="4.56">think back to World War two it just I</text>
  <text start="1856.75" dur="4.14">mean everyone didn&amp;#39;t wake up in every</text>
  <text start="1858.79" dur="4.95">single country wasn&amp;#39;t in war it started</text>
  <text start="1860.89" dur="6.4">out slowly you know Germany wentals</text>
  <text start="1863.74" dur="6.13">Austria then they invaded Poland and</text>
  <text start="1867.29" dur="5.28">down the line and all of a sudden after</text>
  <text start="1869.87" dur="5.91">many years it broke out to a world war</text>
  <text start="1872.57" dur="7.23">and it went from 1936 all the way up to</text>
  <text start="1875.78" dur="7.53">at 45 46 around that time so it was 10</text>
  <text start="1879.8" dur="5.31">years or so that this went on and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1883.31" dur="4.02">going to see the same thing happen here</text>
  <text start="1885.11" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s going to start out in you know Iran</text>
  <text start="1887.33" dur="3.78">and Syria you know Russia will start</text>
  <text start="1889.4" dur="3.6">fighting other countries will start</text>
  <text start="1891.11" dur="4.02">getting involved it will expand China</text>
  <text start="1893" dur="5.16">and Japan it will break out there and</text>
  <text start="1895.13" dur="6.03">this will be over many many years and we</text>
  <text start="1898.16" dur="4.86">understand that this is definitely going</text>
  <text start="1901.16" dur="3.96">to happen because this is what the</text>
  <text start="1903.02" dur="4.05">central bankers globalist the elite</text>
  <text start="1905.12" dur="3.99">whatever you want to call them want</text>
  <text start="1907.07" dur="3.84">because this helps them in many many</text>
  <text start="1909.11" dur="5.25">ways first of all it reduces the</text>
  <text start="1910.91" dur="7.38">population secondly it provides an</text>
  <text start="1914.36" dur="6">increase a huge amount of wealth because</text>
  <text start="1918.29" dur="4.95">they can supply weapons to both sides</text>
  <text start="1920.36" dur="4.47">they don&amp;#39;t care and when it&amp;#39;s all said</text>
  <text start="1923.24" dur="4.05">and done they believe they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1924.83" dur="4.5">restart the system and the collapse and</text>
  <text start="1927.29" dur="3.87">everything else does not blamed on them</text>
  <text start="1929.33" dur="3.51">hopefully by then they&amp;#39;re hoping that</text>
  <text start="1931.16" dur="4.95">they get rid of the Constitution in the</text>
  <text start="1932.84" dur="6.18">US and this is how all of this is going</text>
  <text start="1936.11" dur="4.62">to play out there is also report right</text>
  <text start="1939.02" dur="3.09">now that Israel and Saudi Arabia are</text>
  <text start="1940.73" dur="4.86">working together on a plan for a</text>
  <text start="1942.11" dur="5.79">possible attack against Iran so Israel</text>
  <text start="1945.59" dur="4.38">and Saudi Arabia RCT working together on</text>
  <text start="1947.9" dur="3.93">plans for a possible attack now I know</text>
  <text start="1949.97" dur="3.96">Saudi Arabia was out there saying no</text>
  <text start="1951.83" dur="3.99">we&amp;#39;re not going to do this and this is</text>
  <text start="1953.93" dur="5.07">untrue but again do you really believe</text>
  <text start="1955.82" dur="6.63">them and you know the Geneva talks fail</text>
  <text start="1959" dur="6.3">to roll back Iran&amp;#39;s nuclear program they</text>
  <text start="1962.45" dur="6.48">are going to get ready to attack Iran</text>
  <text start="1965.3" dur="6.48">and you know this is this is how this is</text>
  <text start="1968.93" dur="7.89">all playing out and this is all for what</text>
  <text start="1971.78" dur="7.74">is about to happen so we can see the</text>
  <text start="1976.82" dur="6.45">preparations and how they are preparing</text>
  <text start="1979.52" dur="5.22">for this next false flag event and this</text>
  <text start="1983.27" dur="3.39">is going further because you have to</text>
  <text start="1984.74" dur="3.93">remember this event that&amp;#39;s coming is not</text>
  <text start="1986.66" dur="3.93">going to be a little event this is going</text>
  <text start="1988.67" dur="4.2">to be something really big and major and</text>
  <text start="1990.59" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s going to include many different</text>
  <text start="1992.87" dur="4.17">types of attacks is going to include a</text>
  <text start="1995.27" dur="4.11">chemical it&amp;#39;s going to include a nuclear</text>
  <text start="1997.04" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s going to include a cyber attack so</text>
  <text start="1999.38" dur="5.16">all of this is</text>
  <text start="2001.12" dur="5.31">to come into play and right now we</text>
  <text start="2004.54" dur="5.13">understand that sis play is pending in</text>
  <text start="2006.43" dur="5.879">the Senate and right now the government</text>
  <text start="2009.67" dur="4.59">is pushing for sis but to be passed</text>
  <text start="2012.309" dur="5.131">because the rate of cyber attacks are</text>
  <text start="2014.26" dur="6">too fast and furious and companies are</text>
  <text start="2017.44" dur="6.27">not sharing their information so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2020.26" dur="5.28">trying to pass sis / right now on the</text>
  <text start="2023.71" dur="5.25">premise that these cyber attacks are</text>
  <text start="2025.54" dur="4.86">coming really fast and there&amp;#39;s no clear</text>
  <text start="2028.96" dur="3.24">way of getting information from</text>
  <text start="2030.4" dur="3.69">companies because all these laws are on</text>
  <text start="2032.2" dur="6.45">our way and we need we need to get rid</text>
  <text start="2034.09" dur="6.21">of these laws with sista and you know</text>

  <text start="2206.99" dur="6.21">emphasizes quantity over quality whereas</text>
  <text start="2210.95" dur="4.47">bin Laden preach big dramatic acts</text>
  <text start="2213.2" dur="5.879">directed by him and senior al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="2215.42" dur="6.33">leaders al Sri urges the creation of</text>
  <text start="2219.079" dur="6.301">self generating cells of lone terrorists</text>
  <text start="2221.75" dur="6.66">or small groups in a 1600 page internet</text>
  <text start="2225.38" dur="5.91">manifesto there they are to keep up</text>
  <text start="2228.41" dur="5.4">attacks like multiplying fleas on a dog</text>
  <text start="2231.29" dur="7.35">that finds itself endlessly distracted</text>
  <text start="2233.81" dur="6.84">and ultimately dysfunctional al Qaeda&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2238.64" dur="3.99">capabilities for a strike in the United</text>
  <text start="2240.65" dur="5.55">States are more dangerous and more</text>
  <text start="2242.63" dur="5.64">numerous than before 911 for better or</text>
  <text start="2246.2" dur="4.71">worse the only hope to track them all is</text>
  <text start="2248.27" dur="5.19">an exceptionally deep organized and free</text>
  <text start="2250.91" dur="5.459">raging intelligence apparatus which</text>
  <text start="2253.46" dur="4.83">means more spying on the American people</text>
  <text start="2256.369" dur="3.661">to keep up you know this threat that</text>
  <text start="2258.29" dur="5.579">there are terrorists out there and we</text>
  <text start="2260.03" dur="7.73">need more types of intrusions into our</text>
  <text start="2263.869" dur="8.241">lives and spying on the people</text>
  <text start="2267.76" dur="7.23">and they have been tracking el Sri his</text>
  <text start="2272.11" dur="5.37">rise for years but they cannot find out</text>
  <text start="2274.99" dur="4.26">where he is at time at this time just</text>
  <text start="2277.48" dur="5.04">like bin Laden they had no idea where he</text>
  <text start="2279.25" dur="7.53">was and what this goes on to say is that</text>
  <text start="2282.52" dur="8.16">some officials suggest that to do to</text>
  <text start="2286.78" dur="6.69">stop them and to track them they need to</text>
  <text start="2290.68" dur="5.1">increase the amount of the NSA&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2293.47" dur="5.28">monitoring against these potential</text>
  <text start="2295.78" dur="5.43">threats they need to expand the NSA and</text>
  <text start="2298.75" dur="4.68">we can see where and what they are doing</text>
  <text start="2301.21" dur="4.47">at this time they are moving this to the</text>
  <text start="2303.43" dur="4.83">next stage they are building up the next</text>
  <text start="2305.68" dur="5.78">bin Laden they&amp;#39;re putting the evil face</text>
