  <text start="40.879" dur="5.791">central bankers continually suppressing</text>
  <text start="43.46" dur="5.16">gold before the economy collapses let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="46.67" dur="5.639">get right into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="48.62" dur="5.67">financial news now it looks like the</text>
  <text start="52.309" dur="3.061">high-frequency traders the plunge</text>
  <text start="54.29" dur="3.57">protection team they are working</text>
  <text start="55.37" dur="3.869">overtime today they had to bring that</text>
  <text start="57.86" dur="3.78">market back up to make everyone believe</text>
  <text start="59.239" dur="5.19">that the economy is doing well and very</text>
  <text start="61.64" dur="5.19">interestingly we saw a gold rising early</text>
  <text start="64.429" dur="5.131">in the morning and it was moving up</text>
  <text start="66.83" dur="8.39">moving up moving up and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="69.56" dur="10.11">something happened out of the blue and</text>
  <text start="75.22" dur="8.62">when you look closely but why the gold</text>
  <text start="79.67" dur="8.119">price dropped dramatically we see that</text>
  <text start="83.84" dur="8.88">there were eighteen thousand contracts</text>
  <text start="87.789" dur="10.47">worth over 2.3 billion dollars they were</text>
  <text start="92.72" dur="9.87">dumped in 10 minutes and the entire</text>
  <text start="98.259" dur="9.07">price of gold dropped this is how they</text>
  <text start="102.59" dur="7.65">bring the gold price down and they need</text>
  <text start="107.329" dur="7.68">to do this because they cannot let on</text>
  <text start="110.24" dur="7.589">that the economy is deteriorating gold</text>
  <text start="115.009" dur="5.491">is continually moving up many people are</text>
  <text start="117.829" dur="6.33">getting out of these stocks and bonds</text>
  <text start="120.5" dur="5.49">and putting it into hard assets and you</text>
  <text start="124.159" dur="4.231">can see the central bank they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="125.99" dur="4.529">to continually do this until the very</text>
  <text start="128.39" dur="4.14">end even when we are in the collapse</text>
  <text start="130.519" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re going to continually try to do</text>
  <text start="132.53" dur="3.59">this but eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="133.609" dur="4.91">happen it&amp;#39;s going to break free and</text>
  <text start="136.12" dur="5.47">they&amp;#39;ll have no where to go with this</text>
  <text start="138.519" dur="5.681">now we are seeing that more and more</text>
  <text start="141.59" dur="6.45">companies are calling for layoffs we see</text>

  <text start="162.35" dur="3.66">a lot more layoffs</text>
  <text start="163.94" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;re going to see the earnings for</text>
  <text start="166.01" dur="5.87">corporations they&amp;#39;re going to decline</text>
  <text start="168.62" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;re going to see more and more retail</text>

  <text start="175.37" dur="7.73">off and we&amp;#39;re not going to see this</text>
  <text start="178.52" dur="6.93">improve anytime soon because the entire</text>
  <text start="183.1" dur="4">economy not just in the US but the</text>
  <text start="185.45" dur="4.53">global economy it is completely</text>
  <text start="187.1" dur="4.74">contracting at this time when we look at</text>
  <text start="189.98" dur="3.9">the empire fed everyone thought last</text>
  <text start="191.84" dur="6.48">month Wow everything is getting better</text>
  <text start="193.88" dur="7.98">the Empire fed survey it shot up out of</text>
  <text start="198.32" dur="6.12">nowhere and then guess what happened</text>
  <text start="201.86" dur="6.06">just like everything else it&amp;#39;s dropped</text>
  <text start="204.44" dur="7.44">back down to where we were now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="207.92" dur="8.4">surged to 9.6 and it just dropped back</text>
  <text start="211.88" dur="6.65">down to by negative 9 and they thought</text>
  <text start="216.32" dur="4.74">it was going to rise again x 6.5</text>
  <text start="218.53" dur="6.91">completely off on what they thought was</text>
  <text start="221.06" dur="9.66">going to happen and it disaffected new</text>
  <text start="225.44" dur="8.73">orders that plunged we saw prices that</text>
  <text start="230.72" dur="9.63">plunged and even hope fell at the same</text>
  <text start="234.17" dur="8.46">exact time now we seen corporations come</text>
  <text start="240.35" dur="3.45">out with their first quarter quarterly</text>
  <text start="242.63" dur="4.8">earnings and they were to complete</text>
  <text start="243.8" dur="6.3">disaster now we&amp;#39;re getting signs of the</text>
  <text start="247.43" dur="6.589">second quarter quarterly earnings and</text>
  <text start="250.1" dur="7.46">guess what they don&amp;#39;t look any better</text>
  <text start="254.019" dur="8.261">the second quarter which is 83 companies</text>
  <text start="257.56" dur="8.92">58 have issued negative guidance 25 have</text>
  <text start="262.28" dur="5.55">issued positive guidance and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="266.48" dur="4.439">seeing right now in the second quarter</text>
  <text start="267.83" dur="5.28">in terms of earning we see an estimated</text>
  <text start="270.919" dur="5.341">decline of negative four point six</text>
  <text start="273.11" dur="4.559">percent for red for revenues we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="276.26" dur="4.68">seeing a negative one-point-three</text>
  <text start="277.669" dur="6.421">percent now this is very early but as</text>
  <text start="280.94" dur="5.27">time goes on how all of a sudden is</text>
  <text start="284.09" dur="4.11">everything going to improve its not</text>
  <text start="286.21" dur="3.7">they&amp;#39;re going to continually decline</text>
  <text start="288.2" dur="5.61">decline decline because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="289.91" dur="7.71">seeing is like IBM caterpillar Microsoft</text>
  <text start="293.81" dur="5.01">Apple sales are declining</text>
  <text start="297.62" dur="4.32">even talked about the retail stores</text>
  <text start="298.82" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re all declining so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="301.94" dur="6.33">seeing right now is that everything is</text>
  <text start="304.37" dur="7.799">completely declining right now and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="308.27" dur="8.34">getting worse as time goes on now very</text>
  <text start="312.169" dur="9">interestingly what we&amp;#39;re seeing is the</text>
  <text start="316.61" dur="7.83">stock buybacks they&amp;#39;re tapering off at</text>
  <text start="321.169" dur="5.341">this point now we know the corporation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="324.44" dur="3.81">come out and we know a lot of retail</text>
  <text start="326.51" dur="3.54">investors are out there they&amp;#39;re selling</text>
  <text start="328.25" dur="3.87">their stocks we know the corporations</text>
  <text start="330.05" dur="3.45">are buying back their stocks and of</text>
  <text start="332.12" dur="4.38">course they&amp;#39;re laying off people first</text>
  <text start="333.5" dur="4.889">cutting costs to raise the capital to</text>
  <text start="336.5" dur="7.74">buy these stocks but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="338.389" dur="10.5">right now is that the corporations who</text>
  <text start="344.24" dur="8.429">were buying back their stocks they just</text>
  <text start="348.889" dur="5.461">put a halt to it now this is very</text>
  <text start="352.669" dur="4.53">interesting because if they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="354.35" dur="4.14">continually buying back their stock the</text>
  <text start="357.199" dur="2.791">stock market&amp;#39;s got not going to be</text>
  <text start="358.49" dur="3.42">pushed up the way it&amp;#39;s been pushed up</text>
  <text start="359.99" dur="5.04">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see signs of this</text>
  <text start="361.91" dur="6.42">actually and we can see right now like</text>
  <text start="365.03" dur="6.21">Apple IBM they put their the brakes on</text>
  <text start="368.33" dur="7.92">right now and we see repurchases have</text>
  <text start="371.24" dur="8.64">dropped by thirty-eight percent and this</text>
  <text start="376.25" dur="5.52">is the biggest decline since 2009 so we</text>
  <text start="379.88" dur="4.59">see a lot of things at work right now</text>
  <text start="381.77" dur="5.579">because we are seeing everything come to</text>
  <text start="384.47" dur="5.52">a head we&amp;#39;re seeing retail investors get</text>
  <text start="387.349" dur="4.081">out of the market we see corporations</text>
  <text start="389.99" dur="2.94">their earnings are absolutely awful</text>
  <text start="391.43" dur="3.419">they&amp;#39;re starting to lay off people and</text>
  <text start="392.93" dur="3.06">instead of buying back their stock</text>
  <text start="394.849" dur="2.641">because they realize what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="395.99" dur="5.07">happen to the stock market they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="397.49" dur="7.2">putting the brakes on that and we see</text>
  <text start="401.06" dur="6.66">right now with Bank of America the smart</text>
  <text start="404.69" dur="4.349">money there for the for the 15th week in</text>
  <text start="407.72" dur="3.229">a row they&amp;#39;re getting out of the market</text>
  <text start="409.039" dur="3.81">they don&amp;#39;t even want to be in it and</text>
  <text start="410.949" dur="4.811">we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of people putting</text>
  <text start="412.849" dur="4.261">their funds into gold and then we have</text>
  <text start="415.76" dur="3.74">the central bank on the other hand</text>
  <text start="417.11" dur="5.7">trying to continually suppress gold</text>
  <text start="419.5" dur="5.41">which actually makes it very nice for a</text>
  <text start="422.81" dur="4.979">lot of people still because you can get</text>
  <text start="424.91" dur="5.85">in at gold at a very low price silver at</text>
  <text start="427.789" dur="3.631">a very low price because once gold and</text>
  <text start="430.76" dur="3.51">silver star</text>
  <text start="431.42" dur="3.99">to take off at that point I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="434.27" dur="3.45">anyone&amp;#39;s going to be able to get it at</text>
  <text start="435.41" dur="5.7">that time actually they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="437.72" dur="6.9">tapped out the gold prices are going to</text>
  <text start="441.11" dur="5.76">rise way too fast and those people who</text>
  <text start="444.62" dur="3.54">are not purchasing at this time they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="446.87" dur="3.24">just going to miss it completely and</text>
  <text start="448.16" dur="3.42">this is most of America at this time</text>
  <text start="450.11" dur="3.96">because we&amp;#39;ve been brought up</text>
  <text start="451.58" dur="5.52">brainwashed to think that gold isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="454.07" dur="4.95">money we&amp;#39;ve been brainwashed to think</text>
  <text start="457.1" dur="3.6">that it so it looked nice and jewelry</text>
  <text start="459.02" dur="6.11">and things like that but we really</text>
  <text start="460.7" dur="7.89">shouldn&amp;#39;t hold it now of course the</text>
  <text start="465.13" dur="6.73">investors the elite they know what gold</text>
  <text start="468.59" dur="5.31">is they understand it they know what</text>
  <text start="471.86" dur="3.62">hard assets are this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="473.9" dur="5.07">trading in their paper and ink</text>
  <text start="475.48" dur="7.81">purchasing land purchasing anything</text>
  <text start="478.97" dur="8.55">that&amp;#39;s an actual asset that they can</text>
  <text start="483.29" dur="7.35">feel they can touch that&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="487.52" dur="4.94">worth something later on not paper and</text>
  <text start="490.64" dur="4.35">ink that they create out of thin air</text>
  <text start="492.46" dur="5.74">because if you notice a hard-ass is it</text>
  <text start="494.99" dur="7.8">something that you just can&amp;#39;t create out</text>
  <text start="498.2" dur="9.39">of thin air you have to mine it land</text>
  <text start="502.79" dur="7.65">well you just can&amp;#39;t create land and you</text>
  <text start="507.59" dur="4.44">can see right now that everyone at this</text>
  <text start="510.44" dur="5.46">point should be thinking to themselves</text>
  <text start="512.03" dur="7.05">hmm I&amp;#39;ll hold a little bit of cash let</text>
  <text start="515.9" dur="4.65">me get golden silver for insurance gold</text>
  <text start="519.08" dur="4.95">and silver has been around for a very</text>
  <text start="520.55" dur="8.24">long time it&amp;#39;s money if you look at the</text>
  <text start="524.03" dur="7.98">other countries like Russia China India</text>
  <text start="528.79" dur="4.51">around the world the people and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="532.01" dur="6.12">even talking about the government of the</text>
  <text start="533.3" dur="9.84">central bank&amp;#39;s they understand that gold</text>
  <text start="538.13" dur="8.97">and silver that is the money now China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="543.14" dur="5.73">largest bank icbc standard bank we</text>
  <text start="547.1" dur="4.89">understand that they&amp;#39;ve been purchasing</text>
  <text start="548.87" dur="5.13">the vault in London the gold and silver</text>
  <text start="551.99" dur="4.11">vault because they&amp;#39;re enlarging their</text>
  <text start="554" dur="4.77">footprint because they need place to put</text>
  <text start="556.1" dur="5.61">their gold and silver and we know that</text>
  <text start="558.77" dur="5.13">Barclays decision right now is to exit</text>
  <text start="561.71" dur="3.27">the business of gold and silver and</text>
  <text start="563.9" dur="3.27">we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="564.98" dur="6.03">a lot of other banks are doing the same</text>
  <text start="567.17" dur="11.27">JPMorgan Chase deutsche bank because</text>
  <text start="571.01" dur="12.05">they have been investigated by the</text>
  <text start="578.44" dur="8.079">european union regulators in regards to</text>
  <text start="583.06" dur="6.37">manipulating precious metals gold and</text>
  <text start="586.519" dur="7.141">silver and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="589.43" dur="9.33">china is quietly cornering the market</text>
  <text start="593.66" dur="6.84">for london physical gold and we have to</text>
  <text start="598.76" dur="5.28">think about this for a second we have</text>
  <text start="600.5" dur="6.149">China who&amp;#39;s been purchasing a huge</text>
  <text start="604.04" dur="4.979">amount of gold we&amp;#39;ve have Russia who&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="621.17" dur="9">fix on gold for physical gold and what</text>
  <text start="626.149" dur="8.091">they&amp;#39;re gearing towards is basically</text>
  <text start="630.17" dur="6.39">capturing the physical gold market and</text>
  <text start="634.24" dur="6.01">this is what they&amp;#39;re doing at this point</text>
  <text start="636.56" dur="6.75">and what we see happening right now as</text>
  <text start="640.25" dur="4.949">they continually do this there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="643.31" dur="7.889">to be no stopping gold as it continually</text>
  <text start="645.199" dur="7.231">moves upward because we know the central</text>
  <text start="651.199" dur="3.361">bank and all the other banks they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="652.43" dur="6.23">been manipulating precious metals we saw</text>
  <text start="654.56" dur="5.88">it today as they use paper contracts and</text>
  <text start="658.66" dur="5.46">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="660.44" dur="3.68">this was going to come to an end and</text>
  <text start="664.24" dur="8.649">they won&amp;#39;t be able to do it anymore and</text>
  <text start="668.139" dur="5.981">this at this point you need to be</text>
  <text start="672.889" dur="4.831">prepared look what&amp;#39;s happening in</text>
  <text start="674.12" dur="6.87">Venezuela at this time people are</text>

  <text start="691.399" dur="7.171">as the economy collapses and then you</text>
  <text start="695.899" dur="5.811">have the police out there not</text>
  <text start="698.57" dur="8.25">detecting them but beating on them</text>
  <text start="701.71" dur="7.6">pushing them around and we should look</text>
  <text start="706.82" dur="5.37">at this situation and say hmm could this</text>
  <text start="709.31" dur="4.77">eventually come to the United States and</text>
  <text start="712.19" dur="7.29">yes it will eventually come to the</text>
  <text start="714.08" dur="7.95">United States now Obamacare as we know</text>

  <text start="722.03" dur="8.67">people whatsoever and we understand that</text>
  <text start="725.24" dur="8.19">Obama just came out and he took away the</text>
  <text start="730.7" dur="6.66">employer mandate I mean he just decided</text>
  <text start="733.43" dur="5.91">to do it he wrote a new law stating okay</text>
  <text start="737.36" dur="4.53">we&amp;#39;re going to put this off but what</text>
  <text start="739.34" dur="6.93">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="741.89" dur="8.54">employer mandate is coming up and this</text>

  <text start="750.43" dur="6.27">the people and on businesses and</text>
  <text start="753.7" dur="6.88">employers are set to face a massive loss</text>
  <text start="756.7" dur="7.95">for example if an average family their</text>
  <text start="760.58" dur="7.35">insurance plan sits around 1950 a month</text>
  <text start="764.65" dur="6.85">remember it used to be around 600-700</text>
  <text start="767.93" dur="7.65">dollars employers are going to be set to</text>
  <text start="771.5" dur="5.67">pay about half of that at 50 employees</text>
  <text start="775.58" dur="3.45">of the company had around 50 employees</text>
  <text start="777.17" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s around fifty thousand dollars a</text>
  <text start="779.03" dur="8.1">month or six hundred thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="781.43" dur="8.82">annually now how is the company going to</text>
  <text start="787.13" dur="5.54">operate at this point in time well what</text>
  <text start="790.25" dur="5.58">a lot of companies are doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="792.67" dur="5.38">saying okay listen if you have health</text>
  <text start="795.83" dur="3.42">insurance we&amp;#39;re not going to give to</text>
  <text start="798.05" dur="4.74">your spouse so you can go to the</text>
  <text start="799.25" dur="7.38">exchange we&amp;#39;re only going to support the</text>
  <text start="802.79" dur="8.01">actual employee UPS is doing this they</text>
  <text start="806.63" dur="6.63">started this back in 2014 we also see</text>
  <text start="810.8" dur="3.75">that other companies are saying okay</text>
  <text start="813.26" dur="2.52">we&amp;#39;re going to reduce your hours we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="814.55" dur="6.18">not going to give it to part-time people</text>
  <text start="815.78" dur="8.1">and some are saying I rather take the</text>
  <text start="820.73" dur="6.18">three thousand dollar penalty because it</text>
  <text start="823.88" dur="5.91">is cheaper than paying for all this</text>
  <text start="826.91" dur="5.49">health insurance depending on how many</text>
  <text start="829.79" dur="6.12">people there are in the company</text>
  <text start="832.4" dur="7.8">and we already see that a lot of</text>
  <text start="835.91" dur="7.11">companies that are out there it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="840.2" dur="4.38">to be a complete disaster I mean if you</text>
  <text start="843.02" dur="2.76">really think about what they did the</text>
  <text start="844.58" dur="3.51">insurance companies got together with</text>
  <text start="845.78" dur="5.04">the government and they created this to</text>
  <text start="848.09" dur="5.04">be a money grab not to say hey you know</text>
  <text start="850.82" dur="5.25">something let&amp;#39;s give the people the best</text>
  <text start="853.13" dur="5.73">benefit ever let&amp;#39;s make them all healthy</text>
  <text start="856.07" dur="8.88">let&amp;#39;s keep our population healthy let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="858.86" dur="7.83">give them in a system where they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="864.95" dur="4.29">have to worry about health care no</text>
  <text start="866.69" dur="4.71">actually it&amp;#39;s the opposite people are</text>
  <text start="869.24" dur="3.48">now worrying about how am I going to</text>
  <text start="871.4" dur="3.15">come up with this money to pay for this</text>
  <text start="872.72" dur="4.02">companies are saying okay I&amp;#39;d rather</text>
  <text start="874.55" dur="3.54">take the penalty then pay for the</text>
  <text start="876.74" dur="3.03">insurance or if I have to pay for the</text>
  <text start="878.09" dur="4.05">insurance I&amp;#39;m only going to give it to</text>
  <text start="879.77" dur="3.87">the employer and not the spouse and the</text>
  <text start="882.14" dur="3.51">kids and the rest of the family let them</text>
  <text start="883.64" dur="3.87">go off and get it on their own and that</text>
  <text start="885.65" dur="4.89">puts more of the burden on the family</text>
  <text start="887.51" dur="6">and when you&amp;#39;re looking at a situation</text>
  <text start="890.54" dur="5.64">where it&amp;#39;s a complete money grab this</text>
  <text start="893.51" dur="6.39">doesn&amp;#39;t benefit anybody actually it</text>
  <text start="896.18" dur="6.63">always ends in disaster and this is what</text>
  <text start="899.9" dur="8.61">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now this whole entire</text>
  <text start="902.81" dur="8.04">system is imploding on itself and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="908.51" dur="6.27">getting worse and worse as time goes on</text>
  <text start="910.85" dur="8.55">and this whole entire law needs to be</text>
  <text start="914.78" dur="11.46">removed because it&amp;#39;s not helping the</text>
  <text start="919.4" dur="9.42">people at all and if our government was</text>
  <text start="926.24" dur="6.09">really working for the people they would</text>
  <text start="928.82" dur="5.52">have never let this pass listen everyone</text>
