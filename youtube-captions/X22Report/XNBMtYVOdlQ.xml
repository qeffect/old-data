  <text start="89.38" dur="4.739">the economy for quite a while now and</text>
  <text start="91.54" dur="5.459">we&amp;#39;ve been mapping the deterioration of</text>
  <text start="94.119" dur="4.56">the economy and we&amp;#39;ve been noticing from</text>
  <text start="96.999" dur="4.711">all the economic indicators our retail</text>
  <text start="98.679" dur="5.37">is contracting we notice that GDP is</text>
  <text start="101.71" dur="4.56">contracting we notice that manufacturing</text>
  <text start="104.049" dur="4.831">is contracting the Baltic Dry Index is</text>
  <text start="106.27" dur="4.65">at its lowest point it&amp;#39;s bobbing up and</text>
  <text start="108.88" dur="4.83">down heading downwards in a dent</text>
  <text start="110.92" dur="6.269">downward trend and these are all facts</text>
  <text start="113.71" dur="4.799">these are things that we are looking at</text>
  <text start="117.189" dur="4.081">these are economic indicators that we</text>
  <text start="118.509" dur="4.441">are looking at and they are facts now</text>
  <text start="121.27" dur="4.26">when you look at the government</text>
  <text start="122.95" dur="4.619">information they continually manipulate</text>
  <text start="125.53" dur="5.09">and they explain away why they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="127.569" dur="6.331">count these people on unemployment why</text>
  <text start="130.62" dur="5.47">GDP isn&amp;#39;t where it is people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="133.9" dur="4.62">spending that&amp;#39;s why retail is not doing</text>
  <text start="136.09" dur="4.56">well they point the fingers everywhere</text>
  <text start="138.52" dur="3.84">else except themselves now you have to</text>
  <text start="140.65" dur="3.78">remember the US government central</text>
  <text start="142.36" dur="3.63">bankers they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating all</text>
  <text start="144.43" dur="3.42">along ever since the central bank has</text>
  <text start="145.99" dur="4.65">taken control of our system there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="147.85" dur="5.37">always been manipulation but what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="150.64" dur="5.61">been seeing since 2008 is the</text>
  <text start="153.22" dur="5.67">acceleration of the manipulation where</text>
  <text start="156.25" dur="4.709">they&amp;#39;re going into overdrive because</text>
  <text start="158.89" dur="3.95">they need to manipulate to the tenth to</text>
  <text start="160.959" dur="3.421">the hundredth to the thousands degree</text>
  <text start="162.84" dur="3.88">because the</text>
  <text start="164.38" dur="4.86">economy is deteriorating so rapidly and</text>
  <text start="166.72" dur="4.74">so quickly that the manipulation is so</text>
  <text start="169.24" dur="4.77">obvious right now but they&amp;#39;ve always</text>
  <text start="171.46" dur="8.72">been manipulating in all different areas</text>
  <text start="174.01" dur="9.15">and we know from retail we know from</text>
  <text start="180.18" dur="5.74">manufacturing we know from GDP we know</text>
  <text start="183.16" dur="5.84">from everything else that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="185.92" dur="6.17">looking at that a lot of this is</text>
  <text start="189" dur="4.87">manipulated to convince us that</text>
  <text start="192.09" dur="4.42">everything is all right now if we go</text>
  <text start="193.87" dur="5.64">back in time and we look at all the</text>
  <text start="196.51" dur="5.97">crashes that we&amp;#39;ve had we&amp;#39;ve seen how</text>
  <text start="199.51" dur="5.43">they pumped it up through manipulation</text>
  <text start="202.48" dur="5.55">creating these bubbles and the market</text>
  <text start="204.94" dur="6.06">and everything just dropped and here we</text>
  <text start="208.03" dur="8.4">are once again and if you really look at</text>
  <text start="211" dur="8.46">it we are at it the highest level of the</text>
  <text start="216.43" dur="6.12">manipulation and that tells you because</text>
  <text start="219.46" dur="6.8">we see the pattern across time that this</text>
  <text start="222.55" dur="6.53">fall is going to be catastrophic and</text>
  <text start="226.26" dur="5.68">we&amp;#39;re starting to see cracks everywhere</text>
  <text start="229.08" dur="6.31">we realize that real estate is coming</text>
  <text start="231.94" dur="6.15">down there&amp;#39;s actually a report that us</text>
  <text start="235.39" dur="5.73">form Lamb who their prices have been</text>
  <text start="238.09" dur="5.79">rising exponentially you know for a very</text>
  <text start="241.12" dur="8.88">long time since 1986 now we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="243.88" dur="8.79">drop of farmland in price and according</text>
  <text start="250" dur="5.13">to several regional fed reports real</text>
  <text start="252.67" dur="5.46">farmland values in parts of the Midwest</text>
  <text start="255.13" dur="7.02">fell at their fastest clip in almost 30</text>
  <text start="258.13" dur="5.91">years during the first quarter now the</text>
  <text start="262.15" dur="5.91">question is why is this happening why</text>
  <text start="264.04" dur="6.66">are we seeing this well there&amp;#39;s many</text>
  <text start="268.06" dur="4.86">different reasons one being GMO foods a</text>
  <text start="270.7" dur="5.1">lot of countries are turning away our</text>
  <text start="272.92" dur="4.56">agriculture a lot of states now are</text>
  <text start="275.8" dur="4.32">implementing laws where they have to be</text>
  <text start="277.48" dur="4.68">labeled and we&amp;#39;re noticing that those</text>
  <text start="280.12" dur="4.89">food manufacturers who said it was going</text>
  <text start="282.16" dur="5.61">to be so costly to label that this is a</text>
  <text start="285.01" dur="5.61">GMO product they&amp;#39;re actually moving away</text>
  <text start="287.77" dur="4.38">from GMOs it&amp;#39;s funny because they can</text>
  <text start="290.62" dur="2.94">put labels on everything that says new</text>
  <text start="292.15" dur="3.29">and improved they can redesign the</text>
  <text start="293.56" dur="4.71">entire package but just putting a little</text>
  <text start="295.44" dur="4.81">printed little saying that</text>
  <text start="298.27" dur="4.38">this is GMO that was going to be not</text>
  <text start="300.25" dur="4.5">cost effective for them but it is cost</text>
  <text start="302.65" dur="3.54">effective for them to move away from GMO</text>
  <text start="304.75" dur="3.96">because they realize if they label their</text>
  <text start="306.19" dur="3.93">products GMO guess what happens people</text>
  <text start="308.71" dur="4.32">are going to turn away from them just</text>
  <text start="310.12" dur="4.08">like the other countries and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="313.03" dur="3.18">know about you but I like to know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="314.2" dur="4.41">going in my body I think I have that</text>
  <text start="316.21" dur="8.99">right to know that I&amp;#39;m eating something</text>
  <text start="318.61" dur="11.61">that was created through DNA processing</text>
  <text start="325.2" dur="8.65">now we see that the land that the the</text>
  <text start="330.22" dur="6.75">farmland is dropping and what is</text>
  <text start="333.85" dur="6.36">happening right now is that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="336.97" dur="6.03">deteriorating credit conditions farmers</text>
  <text start="340.21" dur="6.18">are not making profits and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="343" dur="5.73">losing a lot of money and we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="346.39" dur="5.09">to see the value of land start to drop</text>
  <text start="348.73" dur="6.54">we&amp;#39;re starting to see housing market</text>
  <text start="351.48" dur="7.59">we&amp;#39;re seeing prices come down and this</text>
  <text start="355.27" dur="7.14">is going to continue as time goes on and</text>
  <text start="359.07" dur="6.52">it&amp;#39;s funny because it reminds me of the</text>
  <text start="362.41" dur="6.96">Great Depression back in 1929 where we</text>
  <text start="365.59" dur="6.09">had almost an identical situation now</text>
  <text start="369.37" dur="3.75">Moody&amp;#39;s is out there and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="371.68" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re gonna have to cut Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="373.12" dur="8.16">Qatar Oman and the reason for them</text>
  <text start="377.44" dur="6.72">cutting their credit rating is because</text>
  <text start="381.28" dur="4.92">of the low oil prices it&amp;#39;s taken a hit</text>
  <text start="384.16" dur="2.94">on their economies and their economies</text>
  <text start="386.2" dur="2.58">aren&amp;#39;t doing well and you have to</text>
  <text start="387.1" dur="4.23">remember they&amp;#39;re taking instructions</text>
  <text start="388.78" dur="4.5">from the United States government to</text>
  <text start="391.33" dur="3.69">continually keep the oil suppressed and</text>
  <text start="393.28" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;s used for many different agendas</text>
  <text start="395.02" dur="4.2">it&amp;#39;s used to put a lot of pressure on</text>
  <text start="396.85" dur="5.4">Russia which is not working it&amp;#39;s used to</text>
  <text start="399.22" dur="4.71">make corporations to make them look like</text>
  <text start="402.25" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re doing much much better than they</text>
  <text start="403.93" dur="4.92">really are because it cuts their costs</text>
  <text start="406.39" dur="6.06">in half or even further and you have to</text>
  <text start="408.85" dur="6.39">remember delivery airline manufacturing</text>
  <text start="412.45" dur="4.65">with lower oil prices it allows them to</text>
  <text start="415.24" dur="4.59">receive a bigger profit and you have to</text>
  <text start="417.1" dur="5.45">remember while they&amp;#39;re doing this they</text>
  <text start="419.83" dur="5.4">haven&amp;#39;t lowered the price in the markets</text>
  <text start="422.55" dur="5.29">they&amp;#39;re cutting corners and shrinking</text>
  <text start="425.23" dur="5.88">packages they&amp;#39;re giving you less of the</text>
  <text start="427.84" dur="3.97">item they&amp;#39;re using other material in</text>
  <text start="431.11" dur="3.43">their prod</text>
  <text start="431.81" dur="4.62">that&amp;#39;s not as high-quality to save and</text>
  <text start="434.54" dur="4.47">cut corners they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="436.43" dur="4.7">can to keep the economy alive to make it</text>
  <text start="439.01" dur="4.77">look like everything is doing well and</text>
  <text start="441.13" dur="5.5">we know when this entire economy falls</text>
  <text start="443.78" dur="6.24">apart it&amp;#39;s going to be horrific and we</text>
  <text start="446.63" dur="5.61">can see this in Venezuela where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="450.02" dur="4.73">under a state of emergency right now an</text>
  <text start="452.24" dur="5.55">economic state of an emergency where</text>
  <text start="454.75" dur="6.73">people are running to the markets</text>
  <text start="457.79" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;re clearing off the shelves because</text>
  <text start="461.48" dur="3.9">we noticed that the value of their</text>
  <text start="463.37" dur="6.14">currency is continually dropping the</text>
  <text start="465.38" dur="6.96">economy is imploding on itself and</text>
  <text start="469.51" dur="5.08">people are becoming desperate now we</text>
  <text start="472.34" dur="3.66">should look at this and say okay if this</text>
  <text start="474.59" dur="2.549">is happening here we&amp;#39;ve seen it in</text>
  <text start="476" dur="3.36">Argentina we&amp;#39;re going to be seeing in</text>
  <text start="477.139" dur="3.75">Brazil we&amp;#39;re seeing it in Greece and</text>
  <text start="479.36" dur="3.779">we&amp;#39;re going to start to see this play</text>
  <text start="480.889" dur="5.941">out throughout the world this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="483.139" dur="5.191">coming to the United States we are going</text>

  <text start="498.89" dur="5.01">is why everyone needs to be prepared</text>

  <text start="665.98" dur="4.83">destroying other infrastructure we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="668.17" dur="8.22">actually backing up our proxy army in</text>
  <text start="670.81" dur="9.15">raka now out in Iraq we see the Kirkuk</text>
  <text start="676.39" dur="5.94">government in Iraq they have said that</text>
  <text start="679.96" dur="5.04">the nation isn&amp;#39;t likely to hang together</text>
  <text start="682.33" dur="6">and in the end it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter</text>
  <text start="685" dur="6.42">because what&amp;#39;s going to happen is the</text>
  <text start="688.33" dur="5.07">country of Iraq is going to split up</text>
  <text start="691.42" dur="2.91">there going to be partitioned now of</text>
  <text start="693.4" dur="2.31">course this is the United States</text>
  <text start="694.33" dur="5.02">government central bankers playing all</text>
  <text start="695.71" dur="10.17">along to separate the Middle East into</text>
  <text start="699.35" dur="9.48">shia into curds into Sunnis into Alawite</text>
  <text start="705.88" dur="5.2">to keep them separated separated and</text>
  <text start="708.83" dur="3.84">apart now they want to do this in Iraq</text>
  <text start="711.08" dur="4.38">they want to do it in Syria Lebanon</text>
  <text start="712.67" dur="5.24">Libya Yemen the entire area because they</text>
  <text start="715.46" dur="5.91">feel this will be a lot easier to govern</text>
  <text start="717.91" dur="7.69">those areas which will be mostly Sunni</text>
  <text start="721.37" dur="6.18">those areas will have the oil the Kurds</text>
  <text start="725.6" dur="4.59">will have the oil and the Shiites</text>
  <text start="727.55" dur="5.04">probably have absolutely nothing and the</text>
  <text start="730.19" dur="3.93">Alawite absolutely nothing and we see</text>
  <text start="732.59" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re moving in this major direction</text>
  <text start="734.12" dur="6.33">at this point and this is all part of</text>
  <text start="736.37" dur="6.18">their plan now we see that the UK</text>
  <text start="740.45" dur="4.89">special forces they have launched black</text>
  <text start="742.55" dur="6.36">ops assaults on the Islamic state using</text>
  <text start="745.34" dur="6.75">electronic warfare now they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="748.91" dur="4.14">cripple the communications and we can</text>
  <text start="752.09" dur="2.28">see at this point they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="753.05" dur="3.51">after this long stay because what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="754.37" dur="5.04">been hearing right now is that the US UK</text>
  <text start="756.56" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re using cyber attacks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="759.41" dur="5.34">using all these different types of</text>
  <text start="761.81" dur="4.86">electronic warfare and you really have</text>
  <text start="764.75" dur="2.91">to think about it the Islamic state if</text>
  <text start="766.67" dur="3.72">we&amp;#39;re really talking about these</text>

  <text start="774.23" dur="7.44">systems using all this technology to</text>
  <text start="777.56" dur="6.33">communicate now most likely not what</text>
  <text start="781.67" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re really trying to do because we</text>
  <text start="783.89" dur="4.38">see it with the US because right now the</text>
  <text start="785.87" dur="4.41">Pentagon wants to new use their new</text>
  <text start="788.27" dur="4.14">ultra secret Space Operations Center to</text>

  <text start="809.68" dur="5.68">Syrian government this is where they</text>
  <text start="812.45" dur="5.52">would use this type of technology they</text>
  <text start="815.36" dur="5.19">would not use it against these terrorist</text>
  <text start="817.97" dur="5.13">group that have primitive equipment</text>
  <text start="820.55" dur="4.8">compared to state actors it makes no</text>
