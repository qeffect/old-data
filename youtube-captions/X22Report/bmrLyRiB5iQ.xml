  <text start="55.01" dur="6.27">x-22 report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="57.17" dur="7.019">episode 1332 a and today&amp;#39;s date is July</text>
  <text start="61.28" dur="5.82">14th 2017 and the title of the episode</text>
  <text start="64.189" dur="6.121">is the central banker paper reveals the</text>
  <text start="67.1" dur="5.339">process of controlling currency let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="70.31" dur="4.5">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="72.439" dur="4.801">news now as we move further and further</text>
  <text start="74.81" dur="4.29">into this summer it looks like the</text>
  <text start="77.24" dur="3.12">people are starting to wise up and</text>
  <text start="79.1" dur="4.79">they&amp;#39;re starting to realize that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="80.36" dur="5.64">something not right in this economy and</text>
  <text start="83.89" dur="4.929">right now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is the</text>
  <text start="86" dur="5.52">biggest 2-week plunge in Bloomberg&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="88.819" dur="6.181">index of the economic comfort in six</text>
  <text start="91.52" dur="5.58">years and you Mitch is reporting one of</text>
  <text start="95" dur="4.77">the biggest disappointments in the</text>
  <text start="97.1" dur="5.4">preliminary print for June and they were</text>
  <text start="99.77" dur="4.709">expecting a 95 and it came in at ninety</text>
  <text start="102.5" dur="4.77">three point one this is the weakest</text>
  <text start="104.479" dur="5.161">since October 2016 before the election</text>
  <text start="107.27" dur="3.599">and now after the election when people</text>
  <text start="109.64" dur="2.94">are saying that the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="110.869" dur="3">well and everything&amp;#39;s fine the Fed is</text>
  <text start="112.58" dur="3.78">saying that looks great to me the</text>
  <text start="113.869" dur="4.681">economy strong people are starting to</text>
  <text start="116.36" dur="4.59">wise up and say you know everything</text>
  <text start="118.55" dur="5.579">doesn&amp;#39;t look as great as it really is</text>
  <text start="120.95" dur="8.069">and we can see right now that hope well</text>
  <text start="124.129" dur="6.451">it is declining rapidly and there&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="129.019" dur="3.69">reason for all this because we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="130.58" dur="4.59">tracking it we understand that the</text>
  <text start="132.709" dur="4.741">numbers that are coming in and if we</text>
  <text start="135.17" dur="4.89">look past all the manipulation we see</text>
  <text start="137.45" dur="4.86">what is really happening in the economy</text>
  <text start="140.06" dur="5.49">now we know that the restaurant industry</text>
  <text start="142.31" dur="6.63">they are not doing well and when we look</text>
  <text start="145.55" dur="5.76">at chain restaurants they have slumped</text>
  <text start="148.94" dur="6.62">to the worst they&amp;#39;ve ever been since</text>
  <text start="151.31" dur="8.069">2009 now for six quarters in a row of</text>
  <text start="155.56" dur="6.16">year-over-year declines it is just not</text>
  <text start="159.379" dur="6.14">improving right now foot traffic at</text>
  <text start="161.72" dur="8.489">chain restaurants fell 3 percent in June</text>
  <text start="165.519" dur="6.72">same store sales fell 1% the 16th month</text>
  <text start="170.209" dur="4.471">in a row of year-over-year declines</text>
  <text start="172.239" dur="4.75">completing the sixth quarter in a row of</text>
  <text start="174.68" dur="6.779">sales declines the longest like I said</text>
  <text start="176.989" dur="8.151">since 2009 now food sales were also down</text>
  <text start="181.459" dur="7.701">alcohol sales were down if you only</text>
  <text start="185.14" dur="5.73">that was up our prices now remember the</text>
  <text start="189.16" dur="3.48">Fed said there is no inflation so I</text>
  <text start="190.87" dur="3.96">don&amp;#39;t know how these prices are going up</text>
  <text start="192.64" dur="4.62">but there&amp;#39;s no inflation whatsoever I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="194.83" dur="3.81">seeing inflation all over the place yes</text>
  <text start="197.26" dur="6.9">it&amp;#39;s being stucked into many different</text>
  <text start="198.64" dur="7.44">markets but we do see it now this is all</text>
  <text start="204.16" dur="5.49">being reported by the executive director</text>
  <text start="206.08" dur="6.6">of insights and knowledge for TV n2k</text>
  <text start="209.65" dur="5.94">whose restaurant industry snapshot</text>
  <text start="212.68" dur="4.95">tracks around 27,000 restaurant units</text>
  <text start="215.59" dur="5.4">from a hundred and fifty five brands</text>
  <text start="217.63" dur="8.85">generating about 67 billion in annual</text>
  <text start="220.99" dur="10.2">revenue and what they saw was that sales</text>
  <text start="226.48" dur="7.05">rose in 45 markets and fell in a hundred</text>
  <text start="231.19" dur="6.69">and fifty now they report that the</text>
  <text start="233.53" dur="7.17">summer season should be solid because</text>
  <text start="237.88" dur="4.859">people have money to spend but what</text>
  <text start="240.7" dur="2.67">they&amp;#39;re seeing is that this is not</text>
  <text start="242.739" dur="3.781">happening</text>
  <text start="243.37" dur="6.63">there&amp;#39;s been no major acceleration in</text>
  <text start="246.52" dur="6.719">spending at restaurants and they</text>
  <text start="250" dur="5.82">expected that it would be the same thing</text>
  <text start="253.239" dur="4.831">with housing housing usually does very</text>
  <text start="255.82" dur="5.4">very well in the summer and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="258.07" dur="6.02">the opposite happen right now now if we</text>
  <text start="261.22" dur="7.41">take this and we move it over to autos</text>
  <text start="264.09" dur="7.63">automobile sales they are doing terribly</text>
  <text start="268.63" dur="5.13">and there&amp;#39;s one indicator that we can</text>
  <text start="271.72" dur="3.57">look at here that shows us that auto</text>
  <text start="273.76" dur="3.9">sales are not doing well because we know</text>
  <text start="275.29" dur="5.25">that people don&amp;#39;t go to the automobile</text>
  <text start="277.66" dur="5.61">dealer and say hey listen here&amp;#39;s 30,000</text>
  <text start="280.54" dur="5.16">here&amp;#39;s 20,000 here&amp;#39;s 60,000 I want that</text>
  <text start="283.27" dur="4.62">car what people do is they take out</text>
  <text start="285.7" dur="4.14">leases most likely or they finance and</text>
  <text start="287.89" dur="3.95">it looks like it&amp;#39;s more more leases</text>
  <text start="289.84" dur="6.06">because that&amp;#39;s the cheaper price and</text>
  <text start="291.84" dur="7.78">Wells Fargo is now reporting that loan</text>
  <text start="295.9" dur="7.17">originations they have crashed by 45</text>
  <text start="299.62" dur="6.63">percent year-on-year to only about 4.5</text>
  <text start="303.07" dur="5.46">billion this is the lowest since the</text>
  <text start="306.25" dur="6.65">banks started disclosing the item back</text>
  <text start="308.53" dur="8.639">in 2013 so we&amp;#39;re seeing a downtrend in</text>
  <text start="312.9" dur="6.25">loan origination which shows you that</text>
  <text start="317.169" dur="5.461">people are not buying cars</text>
  <text start="319.15" dur="6.329">remember how it works the automobile</text>
  <text start="322.63" dur="5.069">manufacturer produces as many cars as</text>
  <text start="325.479" dur="5.19">possible and they stuff them into the</text>
  <text start="327.699" dur="6.361">lot the more they stuff the more they</text>
  <text start="330.669" dur="5.701">report those as sales it&amp;#39;s not when the</text>
  <text start="334.06" dur="5.1">individual buys them it&amp;#39;s how much they</text>
  <text start="336.37" dur="4.98">can stuff into the Lots and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="339.16" dur="4.68">happening right now since they sucked as</text>
  <text start="341.35" dur="5.4">much as they possibly could they had a</text>
  <text start="343.84" dur="8.04">lower the requirements for individuals</text>
  <text start="346.75" dur="7.44">to buy those automobiles and now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="351.88" dur="4.44">no one left they&amp;#39;ve hit the subprime and</text>
  <text start="354.19" dur="4.32">hid the subprime subprime people and</text>
  <text start="356.32" dur="4.319">people just they&amp;#39;re out of funds they</text>
  <text start="358.51" dur="4.71">just can&amp;#39;t do it and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="360.639" dur="5.581">is that delinquencies they are on the</text>
  <text start="363.22" dur="4.979">rise and this is why it&amp;#39;s pushing a lot</text>
  <text start="366.22" dur="6.18">of individuals right out of the market</text>
  <text start="368.199" dur="6.421">and automobile sales well they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="372.4" dur="4.62">to hurt as we move forward here it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="374.62" dur="3.18">going to get better we see core retail</text>
  <text start="377.02" dur="3.869">sales</text>
  <text start="377.8" dur="5.88">they are down negative two percent they</text>
  <text start="380.889" dur="5.25">expected a positive two percent now this</text>
  <text start="383.68" dur="3.93">is all of retail it&amp;#39;s not like ooh let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="386.139" dur="3.871">just look at brick-and-mortar let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="387.61" dur="5.64">look at online this is all of it now</text>
  <text start="390.01" dur="6.17">remember how they calculate retail sales</text>
  <text start="393.25" dur="6.03">even though we have stores closing and</text>
  <text start="396.18" dur="5.2">let&amp;#39;s say there&amp;#39;s 50 stores that close</text>
  <text start="399.28" dur="3.9">right now they don&amp;#39;t say okay 50 stores</text>
  <text start="401.38" dur="4.32">closed let&amp;#39;s just cut that off</text>
  <text start="403.18" dur="4.95">they have no sales no they take what</text>
  <text start="405.7" dur="4.83">they have and they calculate it out for</text>
  <text start="408.13" dur="4.319">the rest of the year so this way it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="410.53" dur="4.949">slow decline even though there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="412.449" dur="4.201">sales going on so it&amp;#39;s a big trick to</text>
  <text start="415.479" dur="2.91">make you think that things are a lot</text>
  <text start="416.65" dur="4.139">better than they really are but when we</text>
  <text start="418.389" dur="3.631">look at this we can see that again food</text>
  <text start="420.789" dur="4.711">services down-</text>
  <text start="422.02" dur="6.35">0.2% motor vehicle this is down at</text>
  <text start="425.5" dur="5.039">negative point one percent we see</text>
  <text start="428.37" dur="4.18">gasoline stations down negative one</text>
  <text start="430.539" dur="4.231">point three percent clothing stores down</text>
  <text start="432.55" dur="4.98">negative point one percent sporting</text>
  <text start="434.77" dur="5.79">goods hobbies music stores down negative</text>
  <text start="437.53" dur="4.41">point six percent we see general</text>
  <text start="440.56" dur="2.66">merchandise department stores down</text>
  <text start="441.94" dur="3.69">negative point seven percent</text>
  <text start="443.22" dur="4.09">miscellaneous store retailers down three</text>
  <text start="445.63" dur="5.4">negative three point one percent and</text>
  <text start="447.31" dur="5.67">this goes on and on and on and we can</text>
  <text start="451.03" dur="5.22">see that the retail market it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="452.98" dur="7.44">recovering it&amp;#39;s only going to get worse</text>
  <text start="456.25" dur="7.29">and to make matters even worse and to</text>
  <text start="460.42" dur="4.85">understand how this economy is not</text>
  <text start="463.54" dur="4.53">working at all</text>
  <text start="465.27" dur="5.92">let&amp;#39;s look at San Francisco for a second</text>
  <text start="468.07" dur="4.65">here now people would think today that a</text>
  <text start="471.19" dur="4.05">hundred and thirty-eight thousand</text>
  <text start="472.72" dur="4.89">dollars a year would be a very nice</text>
  <text start="475.24" dur="5.25">income you can live off that you can</text>
  <text start="477.61" dur="7.56">maybe purchase a house you can raise a</text>
  <text start="480.49" dur="7.23">family but in San Francisco there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="485.17" dur="7.44">new piece of legislation that was just</text>
  <text start="487.72" dur="7.77">approved and what this allows it allows</text>
  <text start="492.61" dur="6.63">couples earning up to a hundred and</text>
  <text start="495.49" dur="7.68">thirty eight thousand to get subsidized</text>
  <text start="499.24" dur="6.9">for affordable housing so if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="503.17" dur="6.66">making a hundred thousand ninety</text>
  <text start="506.14" dur="5.66">thousand one hundred thirty thousand you</text>
  <text start="509.83" dur="6.36">can get subsidized to purchase a house</text>
  <text start="511.8" dur="6.94">this is how bad it is gotten who would</text>
  <text start="516.19" dur="5.49">have ever thought making a hundred and</text>
  <text start="518.74" dur="5.489">thirty thousand dollars you would be</text>
  <text start="521.68" dur="5.24">going into affordable housing does that</text>
  <text start="524.229" dur="7.501">make any sense whatsoever now you know</text>
  <text start="526.92" dur="8.47">how the dollar has been devalued now you</text>
  <text start="531.73" dur="6.66">see where inflation is going because</text>
  <text start="535.39" dur="4.95">inflation really means that the value of</text>
  <text start="538.39" dur="5.97">the dollar decreases it means you need</text>
  <text start="540.34" dur="8.7">more dollars to get that same product</text>
  <text start="544.36" dur="7.86">that same house and when it&amp;#39;s not enough</text>
  <text start="549.04" dur="6.2">the government has to step in to help</text>
  <text start="552.22" dur="5.4">and we&amp;#39;re getting to the point now where</text>
  <text start="555.24" dur="5.86">a hundred and thirty thousand or even</text>
  <text start="557.62" dur="6.81">one hundred thirty five thousand you can</text>
  <text start="561.1" dur="6.87">get government assistance this should</text>
  <text start="564.43" dur="5.4">tell everyone how bad it really is we</text>
  <text start="567.97" dur="4.35">see that industrial production growth it</text>
  <text start="569.83" dur="4.65">is slowed for the first time since</text>
  <text start="572.32" dur="4.98">January now</text>
  <text start="574.48" dur="4.26">month on month this is what the</text>
  <text start="577.3" dur="3.6">corporate media is out there reporting</text>
  <text start="578.74" dur="5.52">saying that oh we had this great rebound</text>
  <text start="580.9" dur="4.73">it was up 2.3 percent this is fantastic</text>
  <text start="584.26" dur="3.62">but you have to remember</text>
  <text start="585.63" dur="4.8">they revised the numbers that revised</text>
  <text start="587.88" dur="5.91">May they brought the numbers back into</text>
  <text start="590.43" dur="4.26">June we made it look really great but</text>
  <text start="593.79" dur="4.26">when you really look at it</text>
  <text start="594.69" dur="5.66">year-over-year production has slowed it</text>
  <text start="598.05" dur="5.64">is dropped it&amp;#39;s falling it&amp;#39;s declining</text>
  <text start="600.35" dur="5.86">it&amp;#39;s not doing what they say all they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="603.69" dur="4.26">doing is manipulating the numbers and</text>
  <text start="606.21" dur="3.57">revising it to make the next month look</text>
  <text start="607.95" dur="3.15">even better and then they revise that</text>
  <text start="609.78" dur="2.82">month to make the next one look better</text>
  <text start="611.1" dur="3.93">and then when you go back in time you</text>
  <text start="612.6" dur="5.04">look and you say wow this looks awful</text>
  <text start="615.03" dur="4.2">and then when you go to last year well</text>
  <text start="617.64" dur="3.87">how come it&amp;#39;s getting worse if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="619.23" dur="5.07">telling you how it&amp;#39;s getting better so</text>
  <text start="621.51" dur="5.67">something is wrong here and you could</text>
  <text start="624.3" dur="6.84">tell that things aren&amp;#39;t going well</text>
  <text start="627.18" dur="7.41">because JPMorgan they were giving a</text>
  <text start="631.14" dur="6.42">presentation about their earnings and</text>
  <text start="634.59" dur="6.03">they left out one important slide and I</text>
  <text start="637.56" dur="6.6">think they did this on purpose and they</text>
  <text start="640.62" dur="5.55">were out there saying that their</text>
  <text start="644.16" dur="5.79">earnings and everything looks fantastic</text>
  <text start="646.17" dur="8.07">the part that they left out was the</text>
  <text start="649.95" dur="7.11">credit card charge offs because it shows</text>
  <text start="654.24" dur="6.63">that JP Morgan&amp;#39;s net credit card charge</text>
  <text start="657.06" dur="7.47">off surpassed 1 billion dollars as of</text>
  <text start="660.87" dur="7.74">June 30th and it&amp;#39;s the highest point</text>
  <text start="664.53" dur="7.86">going back to 2013 now as a reminder</text>
  <text start="668.61" dur="8.3">remember what Jamie Dimon said that the</text>
  <text start="672.39" dur="9.36">US consumer remained healthy remember</text>
  <text start="676.91" dur="6.58">whenever a politician a banker a central</text>
  <text start="681.75" dur="4.02">banker comes out there and tells you</text>
  <text start="683.49" dur="4.11">something it&amp;#39;s always the opposite when</text>
  <text start="685.77" dur="3.66">they tell you in the bank listen don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="687.6" dur="4.35">worry everything&amp;#39;s under control it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="689.43" dur="4.68">all contained you will be able to get</text>
  <text start="691.95" dur="4.26">your funds so you don&amp;#39;t have to worry</text>
  <text start="694.11" dur="4.08">that&amp;#39;s the point where you run to the</text>
  <text start="696.21" dur="4.68">bank and you get as much as you possibly</text>
  <text start="698.19" dur="6.15">can actually probably at that point it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="700.89" dur="6.6">too late so what we&amp;#39;re looking at here</text>
  <text start="704.34" dur="6.54">is that their credit card losses they</text>
  <text start="707.49" dur="6.53">were at 1.4 billion an increase of a</text>
  <text start="710.88" dur="6.24">hundred and ninety three million and</text>
  <text start="714.02" dur="4.43">this tells you that something is wrong</text>
  <text start="717.12" dur="4.66">here now this</text>
  <text start="718.45" dur="6.27">it&amp;#39;s with the bigger picture where the</text>
  <text start="721.78" dur="6.27">credit card default it is surged to the</text>
  <text start="724.72" dur="6.03">most since the financial crisis because</text>
  <text start="728.05" dur="5.91">when we look at the credit card default</text>
  <text start="730.75" dur="5.22">this is SP Experian default index we see</text>
  <text start="733.96" dur="5.55">that it is risen by three point five</text>
  <text start="735.97" dur="7.17">three percent up more than 13 percent a</text>
  <text start="739.51" dur="7.74">year ago so all of this jives together</text>
  <text start="743.14" dur="6.69">and it all makes sense so is the US</text>
  <text start="747.25" dur="4.68">consumer really that healthy if retail</text>
  <text start="749.83" dur="4.2">sales are continually declining foot</text>
  <text start="751.93" dur="4.68">traffic spending in restaurants is</text>
  <text start="754.03" dur="5.36">continually declining loan originations</text>
  <text start="756.61" dur="6.87">in the automobile industry is declining</text>
  <text start="759.39" dur="7.45">really the US consumer is really healthy</text>
  <text start="763.48" dur="6.48">when charge-offs are up by a hundred and</text>
  <text start="766.84" dur="8.19">ninety three million and that&amp;#39;s just one</text>
  <text start="769.96" dur="8.33">bank now think about this now what is</text>
  <text start="775.03" dur="6.84">happening here is that the economy is</text>
  <text start="778.29" dur="6.07">limping along it&amp;#39;s actually dead it&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="781.87" dur="4.62">the ground here the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="784.36" dur="3.9">banks they&amp;#39;re all trying to keep it</text>
  <text start="786.49" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re trying to keep it going as long</text>
  <text start="788.26" dur="3.39">as they possibly can because they want</text>
  <text start="790.27" dur="3.99">to control the narrative they want to</text>
  <text start="791.65" dur="6.35">make sure they have full control of how</text>
  <text start="794.26" dur="6.33">this comes down they know it&amp;#39;s dead the</text>
  <text start="798" dur="6.31">problem is the rest of the nation</text>
  <text start="800.59" dur="6.36">doesn&amp;#39;t know there&amp;#39;s a few select we</text>
  <text start="804.31" dur="4.29">know but there&amp;#39;s many others that are</text>
  <text start="806.95" dur="3.57">completely in the dark people are just</text>
  <text start="808.6" dur="3.48">living in this world that they where</text>
  <text start="810.52" dur="5.91">they think that everything is absolutely</text>
  <text start="812.08" dur="7.62">fantastic and what&amp;#39;s worrying is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="816.43" dur="5.82">going to be shocked when the system</text>
  <text start="819.7" dur="5.16">comes down I mean there were plenty of</text>
  <text start="822.25" dur="4.5">people that were shocked when everything</text>
  <text start="824.86" dur="3.57">crashed in 2008 when people lost their</text>
  <text start="826.75" dur="4.71">investments their pensions and</text>
  <text start="828.43" dur="7.32">everything else this time around it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="831.46" dur="6.54">going to be a disaster now there was a</text>
  <text start="835.75" dur="4.98">paper that was out there this was during</text>
  <text start="838" dur="5.61">the Jackson Hole and they were talking</text>
  <text start="840.73" dur="4.58">about negative interest rates and there</text>
  <text start="843.61" dur="5.1">was a paper that was written and</text>
  <text start="845.31" dur="6.029">basically it talks about how to abolish</text>
  <text start="848.71" dur="4.46">the paper currency</text>
  <text start="851.339" dur="3.091">and you would think that they would be</text>
  <text start="853.17" dur="3.659">like okay you know what we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="854.43" dur="4.74">do we&amp;#39;re going to say it&amp;#39;s because of</text>
  <text start="856.829" dur="4.351">you know drug trafficking we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="859.17" dur="3.51">and this is what they&amp;#39;ve been using but</text>
  <text start="861.18" dur="3.81">when you look at the paper and you see</text>
  <text start="862.68" dur="4.829">an excerpt of this and how to kill cash</text>
  <text start="864.99" dur="4.019">because this was what the talk was about</text>
  <text start="867.509" dur="5.55">it wasn&amp;#39;t about negative interest rates</text>
  <text start="869.009" dur="7.2">it was about how to control the currency</text>
  <text start="873.059" dur="6.601">and how to control the people who are</text>
  <text start="876.209" dur="5.24">using the currency and here are some</text>
  <text start="879.66" dur="4.7">parts of what they were talking about</text>
  <text start="881.449" dur="5.231">the most straightforward way to</text>
  <text start="884.36" dur="4.75">unencumbered interest rate policy</text>
  <text start="886.68" dur="5.519">completely at the zero bound is to</text>
  <text start="889.11" dur="5.159">abolish paper currency now they thought</text>
  <text start="892.199" dur="3.99">of different ways to do this now of</text>
  <text start="894.269" dur="4.68">course they&amp;#39;re saying that you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="896.189" dur="5.041">being used for drug trafficking for</text>
  <text start="898.949" dur="4.2">laundering money and this is why we have</text>
  <text start="901.23" dur="4.14">to remove it and they tried to use this</text>
  <text start="903.149" dur="5.971">in other countries around the world and</text>
  <text start="905.37" dur="7.399">it has worked but the other way is to</text>
  <text start="909.12" dur="6.06">get people very comfortable in using</text>
  <text start="912.769" dur="5.8">mobile devices get people very</text>
  <text start="915.18" dur="8.459">comfortable in using their credit card</text>
  <text start="918.569" dur="9.091">or debit card and the other way is to</text>
  <text start="923.639" dur="8.161">raise the ATM charges so people don&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="927.66" dur="7.109">and use the ATM machines because they</text>
  <text start="931.8" dur="5.459">say if they can continually raise these</text>
  <text start="934.769" dur="4.711">charges people will take out less and</text>
  <text start="937.259" dur="4.31">less cash because they don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="939.48" dur="5.25">charged for it so they were thinking</text>
  <text start="941.569" dur="6.37">listen if we put a charge on the</text>
  <text start="944.73" dur="6.299">withdrawal of cash even if it&amp;#39;s your</text>
  <text start="947.939" dur="5.07">bank people would stop taking out cash</text>
  <text start="951.029" dur="3.721">and it would look natural like oh this</text>
  <text start="953.009" dur="3.69">is just part of the thing they increase</text>
  <text start="954.75" dur="4.17">my fees now I&amp;#39;m being charged for cash I</text>
  <text start="956.699" dur="4.95">might as well use my credit card my</text>
  <text start="958.92" dur="4.2">debit my mobile phone and they wanted to</text>
  <text start="961.649" dur="3.54">get people used to this and then all of</text>
  <text start="963.12" dur="4.05">a sudden start taking away some of the</text>
  <text start="965.189" dur="3.9">bills get rid of the hundred get rid of</text>
  <text start="967.17" dur="3.959">this and eventually what would happen is</text>
  <text start="969.089" dur="3.99">you would be left with no cash</text>
  <text start="971.129" dur="4.2">whatsoever and everything would be</text>
  <text start="973.079" dur="4.831">electronic now they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="975.329" dur="5.85">because they understand when this system</text>
  <text start="977.91" dur="5.76">comes down and going forward they want</text>
  <text start="981.179" dur="3.691">complete control of the currency and how</text>
  <text start="983.67" dur="3.93">else do you have complete</text>
  <text start="984.87" dur="6.06">the currency well it&amp;#39;s when you control</text>
  <text start="987.6" dur="6.45">the currency electronically and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="990.93" dur="4.77">talking about the blockchain even if I</text>
  <text start="994.05" dur="4.71">am talking about the blockchain I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="995.7" dur="5.73">talking about the controlled blockchain</text>
  <text start="998.76" dur="5.16">by the central bank because they are</text>
  <text start="1001.43" dur="5.16">looking at this but when they control it</text>
  <text start="1003.92" dur="6.51">this is not a decentralized blockchain</text>
  <text start="1006.59" dur="6.12">system so they&amp;#39;re looking to control</text>
  <text start="1010.43" dur="4.62">everyone and what this enables them to</text>
  <text start="1012.71" dur="4.98">do well they can just shut things down</text>
  <text start="1015.05" dur="4.62">whenever they want now they can still</text>
  <text start="1017.69" dur="5.31">shut it down but you still have the</text>
  <text start="1019.67" dur="5.49">ability to have cash see this is the</text>
  <text start="1023" dur="4.32">difference you can go to one of these</text>
  <text start="1025.16" dur="4.29">places you can take a check and they</text>
  <text start="1027.32" dur="5.43">will give you cash well think about it</text>
  <text start="1029.45" dur="6.48">when cash is gone it goes into an</text>
  <text start="1032.75" dur="5.28">electronic account and then they have</text>
  <text start="1035.93" dur="4.44">full control they also have the ability</text>
  <text start="1038.03" dur="5.52">to know exactly what you&amp;#39;re doing they</text>
  <text start="1040.37" dur="5.34">know exactly where all your funds are so</text>
  <text start="1043.55" dur="4.62">there&amp;#39;s no way of getting out of paying</text>
  <text start="1045.71" dur="4.5">any type of taxes or trying to do</text>
  <text start="1048.17" dur="5.64">anything to show that you didn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="1050.21" dur="6.45">any money to pay taxes they want full</text>
  <text start="1053.81" dur="6.03">control to make sure they know exactly</text>
  <text start="1056.66" dur="5.76">what you&amp;#39;re doing and they had a meeting</text>
  <text start="1059.84" dur="4.41">about this they&amp;#39;re pushing this forward</text>
  <text start="1062.42" dur="4.02">and they already had test cases around</text>
  <text start="1064.25" dur="4.92">the world and this is all being prepped</text>
  <text start="1066.44" dur="6.45">for when the system comes down and the</text>
  <text start="1069.17" dur="6.39">whole reset is done and we can see once</text>
  <text start="1072.89" dur="5.22">the reset is done we might not even see</text>
  <text start="1075.56" dur="5.31">paper currency anymore because if the</text>
  <text start="1078.11" dur="5.13">central bank has their way everything</text>
  <text start="1080.87" dur="4.98">will be digital they will have full</text>
  <text start="1083.24" dur="6.72">control and this is exactly what they</text>
  <text start="1085.85" dur="7.59">want but we as a people we have to push</text>
  <text start="1089.96" dur="6.12">our government we have to push to say</text>

  <text start="1102.68" dur="3.9">the system comes down this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
