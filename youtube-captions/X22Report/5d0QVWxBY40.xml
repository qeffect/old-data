  <text start="101.15" dur="5.64">a bit throughout 2015 especially when we</text>
  <text start="104.09" dur="3.599">saw this Ariza party get elected we</text>
  <text start="106.79" dur="3.27">thought they were going to do the right</text>
  <text start="107.689" dur="5.821">thing but basically they did the wrong</text>
  <text start="110.06" dur="5.93">thing as usual and the central bankers</text>
  <text start="113.51" dur="6.21">got their way and put the country into</text>
  <text start="115.99" dur="5.26">debt further into debt actually and now</text>
  <text start="119.72" dur="3.87">the central bankers are looting the</text>
  <text start="121.25" dur="4.439">country the government is selling off</text>
  <text start="123.59" dur="8.459">bits and pieces of the country and we</text>
  <text start="125.689" dur="10.671">know come 2016 Greece is eligible for</text>
  <text start="132.049" dur="6.811">balance and we understand at this point</text>
  <text start="136.36" dur="4.84">this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="138.86" dur="4.83">now will it happen on january first most</text>
  <text start="141.2" dur="4.379">likely not but throughout the year going</text>
  <text start="143.69" dur="5.19">into februari march we will most likely</text>
  <text start="145.579" dur="6.091">see this but what&amp;#39;s very interesting at</text>
  <text start="148.88" dur="5.699">this point and when you look at it you</text>
  <text start="151.67" dur="5.58">think this is some type of satire you</text>
  <text start="154.579" dur="7.34">think it&amp;#39;s a joke but this is actually</text>
  <text start="157.25" dur="7.33">serious right now Greek taxpayers are</text>
  <text start="161.919" dur="6.581">going to be forced to declare all</text>
  <text start="164.58" dur="7.14">cash under the mattress including inside</text>
  <text start="168.5" dur="5.53">boxes containing more than fifteen</text>
  <text start="171.72" dur="5.49">thousand euros as well as your jewelry</text>
  <text start="174.03" dur="6.15">and precious stones including gold worth</text>
  <text start="177.21" dur="8.04">over thirty thousand euros when is this</text>
  <text start="180.18" dur="8.54">going to start in 2016 so this is the</text>
  <text start="185.25" dur="6.93">first step toward a full-blown asset</text>
  <text start="188.72" dur="7.57">confiscation and we&amp;#39;ve seen governments</text>
  <text start="192.18" dur="5.94">do this many many times before and we</text>
  <text start="196.29" dur="4.17">can see what&amp;#39;s happening right now the</text>
  <text start="198.12" dur="5.82">central bank has full control of this</text>
  <text start="200.46" dur="5.04">country they want everything we saw this</text>
  <text start="203.94" dur="4.47">happen in the depression in the united</text>
  <text start="205.5" dur="5.459">states where they came and they took the</text>
  <text start="208.41" dur="4.38">gold and of course they paid you for it</text>
  <text start="210.959" dur="3.901">but what they did was they gave you</text>
  <text start="212.79" dur="5.01">paper and ink and they took the real</text>
  <text start="214.86" dur="7.5">hard asset and this is what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="217.8" dur="8.82">right now they&amp;#39;re going house to house</text>
  <text start="222.36" dur="9.15">and they&amp;#39;re looking for the hard assets</text>
  <text start="226.62" dur="6.24">and this whole thing is a decision</text>
  <text start="231.51" dur="6.63">that&amp;#39;s issued by the Ministry of Justice</text>
  <text start="232.86" dur="9.48">and finance finance because they need to</text>
  <text start="238.14" dur="7.47">bring in revenue into the country into</text>
  <text start="242.34" dur="6.06">the government because their entire</text>
  <text start="245.61" dur="5.37">system there even though they got the</text>
  <text start="248.4" dur="7.08">bailout it&amp;#39;s not going to the people</text>
  <text start="250.98" dur="8.4">it&amp;#39;s not going to government programs</text>
  <text start="255.48" dur="7.65">it&amp;#39;s going to the creditors and as time</text>
  <text start="259.38" dur="6.63">goes on the country is sinking deeper</text>
  <text start="263.13" dur="5.01">and deeper into a collapse I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="266.01" dur="4.409">already there it&amp;#39;s just getting a lot</text>
  <text start="268.14" dur="3.96">worse now of course the corporate media</text>
  <text start="270.419" dur="3.241">and other governments are saying that</text>
  <text start="272.1" dur="4.92">everything is fine there look the other</text>
  <text start="273.66" dur="6.98">way but the country is being looted the</text>
  <text start="277.02" dur="6.3">people are being looted and come 2016</text>
  <text start="280.64" dur="6.16">they&amp;#39;re going to confiscate their assets</text>
  <text start="283.32" dur="5.72">and they&amp;#39;re going to go into the bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="286.8" dur="4.02">because they&amp;#39;ll have no other choice</text>
  <text start="289.04" dur="4.09">because they just don&amp;#39;t have enough</text>
  <text start="290.82" dur="4.32">revenue coming in they cannot pay these</text>
  <text start="293.13" dur="4.32">interest payments and it&amp;#39;s getting worse</text>
  <text start="295.14" dur="3.09">and worse I mean they couldn&amp;#39;t pay the</text>
  <text start="297.45" dur="2.97">interest payments</text>
  <text start="298.23" dur="3.24">for they got the bail out what makes</text>
  <text start="300.42" dur="2.52">everyone think they&amp;#39;re going to be able</text>
  <text start="301.47" dur="5.88">to pay the interest now that they have</text>
  <text start="302.94" dur="7.5">more debt they just can&amp;#39;t now in Canada</text>
  <text start="307.35" dur="5.31">we see the GDP now is plunging it</text>
  <text start="310.44" dur="5.79">dropped by 0.5% it&amp;#39;s the largest month</text>
  <text start="312.66" dur="6.65">among drop since march of 2009 it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="316.23" dur="5.64">biggest myth since 2008 of December and</text>
  <text start="319.31" dur="5.38">we see the housing bubble is popping in</text>
  <text start="321.87" dur="5.4">Canada we see Canada now is sliding into</text>
  <text start="324.69" dur="5.07">a recession it will be heading in a</text>
  <text start="327.27" dur="6.84">depression just like every single other</text>
  <text start="329.76" dur="6.54">country Puerto Rico we understand is</text>
  <text start="334.11" dur="4.86">going to default now they did something</text>
  <text start="336.3" dur="5.46">very tricky here governor Alejandro</text>
  <text start="338.97" dur="5.87">Garcia Padilla signed an executive order</text>
  <text start="341.76" dur="5.58">to permit the redirection of revenue</text>
  <text start="344.84" dur="5.26">which was budgeted for a highway and</text>
  <text start="347.34" dur="7.56">convention center bonds and they use</text>
  <text start="350.1" dur="6.78">that to pay for the debt now we know</text>
  <text start="354.9" dur="4.08">this is not sustainable we know they</text>
  <text start="356.88" dur="3.78">can&amp;#39;t keep doing this and we know</text>
  <text start="358.98" dur="3.95">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="360.66" dur="4.89">Puerto Rico&amp;#39;s just going to default and</text>
  <text start="362.93" dur="4.84">of course we know Obama is coming up</text>
  <text start="365.55" dur="4.86">with some new laws that they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="367.77" dur="5.16">creating out of thin air because they</text>
  <text start="370.41" dur="5.25">need to do this to stop the default of</text>
  <text start="372.93" dur="5.13">Puerto Rico now of course they don&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="375.66" dur="4.8">this for the everyday person but to keep</text>
  <text start="378.06" dur="4.89">the system alive this is what they will</text>
  <text start="380.46" dur="5.78">do they will continually prop up all</text>
  <text start="382.95" dur="5.79">different areas in the United States if</text>
  <text start="386.24" dur="5.47">propping up is needed they will also</text>
  <text start="388.74" dur="4.71">prop up the entire economy they will</text>
  <text start="391.71" dur="4.35">manipulate the statistical information</text>
  <text start="393.45" dur="5.7">of the economy just to show that</text>
  <text start="396.06" dur="6.3">everything is ok here in the United</text>
  <text start="399.15" dur="4.86">States but everything is not okay we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="402.36" dur="4.08">been watching all the economic</text>
  <text start="404.01" dur="4.71">indicators we&amp;#39;ve been looking at the</text>
  <text start="406.44" dur="4.08">real information not the statistical</text>
  <text start="408.72" dur="3.93">stuff the government puts out and then</text>
  <text start="410.52" dur="4.89">manipulates we&amp;#39;ve been looking at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="412.65" dur="5.22">really been going on now sometimes we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="415.41" dur="4.35">a little bit of a head of what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="417.87" dur="4.95">happening here because we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="419.76" dur="4.62">things every single day and a lot of</text>
  <text start="422.82" dur="3.63">times when we see like housing for</text>
  <text start="424.38" dur="4.56">instance case-shiller a national</text>
  <text start="426.45" dur="4.38">association of realtors you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="428.94" dur="3.09">just catching up to what we&amp;#39;re reporting</text>
  <text start="430.83" dur="2.79">right now now</text>
  <text start="432.03" dur="3.75">when we saw housing prices starting to</text>
  <text start="433.62" dur="4.14">level off and start to come down</text>
  <text start="435.78" dur="3.27">case-shiller the national association of</text>
  <text start="437.76" dur="3">realtors are saying that everything is</text>
  <text start="439.05" dur="3.6">fine housing prices are still</text>
  <text start="440.76" dur="4.11">continually rising but then all of a</text>
  <text start="442.65" dur="3.96">sudden we see a turn and this was like</text>
  <text start="444.87" dur="3">four or five months later well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="446.61" dur="2.52">seeing the same thing happen right now</text>
  <text start="447.87" dur="3.27">because when we look at the housing</text>
  <text start="449.13" dur="7.8">market we&amp;#39;re seeing they&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="451.14" dur="7.62">same exact thing as they did in 2008 now</text>
  <text start="456.93" dur="3.93">we understand that everyone saying well</text>
  <text start="458.76" dur="3.83">housing prices are up there and that</text>
  <text start="460.86" dur="4.16">when the housing prices are up there</text>
  <text start="462.59" dur="5.05">everything they&amp;#39;re doing is fine of</text>
  <text start="465.02" dur="4.6">course when housing prices drop or</text>
  <text start="467.64" dur="4.08">interest rates rise it all falls apart</text>
  <text start="469.62" dur="3.9">and you can see why they need to keep</text>
  <text start="471.72" dur="4.8">pumping the housing prices up but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="473.52" dur="5.55">getting harder and harder so when home</text>
  <text start="476.52" dur="4.43">prices drop and mortgage payments become</text>
  <text start="479.07" dur="6.17">a challenge for whatever reason maybe</text>
  <text start="480.95" dur="7.51">layoffs miscalculation from the get-go</text>
  <text start="485.24" dur="6.28">nothing stops the underwater subprime</text>
  <text start="488.46" dur="6.24">bar from not making any more payments</text>
  <text start="491.52" dur="7.32">and they stopped making payments we see</text>
  <text start="494.7" dur="5.67">foreclosures we see short sales and this</text>
  <text start="498.84" dur="3.06">is what&amp;#39;s going to happen because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="500.37" dur="5.61">seeing the same thing occur that</text>
  <text start="501.9" dur="6.3">happened in 2008 among the hottest</text>
  <text start="505.98" dur="4.82">products right now in the non-bank</text>
  <text start="508.2" dur="6.75">lenders now offer are the following</text>
  <text start="510.8" dur="6.73">ameri homes basically they have a wider</text>
  <text start="514.95" dur="6.63">array of non-agency programs including</text>
  <text start="517.53" dur="7.58">adjustable rate mortgages non-agency 521</text>
  <text start="521.58" dur="8.94">hybrid arms with interest only options</text>
  <text start="525.11" dur="9.55">alt qm mortgages for alternative to</text>
  <text start="530.52" dur="5.91">qualified mortgages so as home prices</text>
  <text start="534.66" dur="3.27">stay where they are i mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="536.43" dur="3.6">starting to level off and fall right now</text>
  <text start="537.93" dur="4.74">but they&amp;#39;re still pretty high everything</text>
  <text start="540.03" dur="6.24">is fine when home prices start to fall</text>
  <text start="542.67" dur="7.8">and interest rates rise all of these</text>
  <text start="546.27" dur="7.8">different types of mortgages fall apart</text>
  <text start="550.47" dur="5.13">and this is what we saw it in 2008 this</text>
  <text start="554.07" dur="2.79">is when we saw people leave their homes</text>
  <text start="555.6" dur="3.42">because they had the adjustable rate</text>
  <text start="556.86" dur="4.14">mortgages interest payment the interest</text>
  <text start="559.02" dur="5.1">rates were going up they couldn&amp;#39;t lock</text>
  <text start="561" dur="3.94">in and they couldn&amp;#39;t make the payments</text>
  <text start="564.12" dur="3.22">if they</text>
  <text start="564.94" dur="4.59">stayed with the arms and they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="567.34" dur="5.16">interest-only payments those were rising</text>
  <text start="569.53" dur="5.46">and guess what they couldn&amp;#39;t afford it</text>
  <text start="572.5" dur="7.68">we are saying we are seeing the same</text>
  <text start="574.99" dur="8.28">thing happen right now and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="580.18" dur="8.28">to see the same subprime crisis that we</text>
  <text start="583.27" dur="9.48">once saw now us magic manufacturing in</text>
