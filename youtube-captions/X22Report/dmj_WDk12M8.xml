  <text start="375.49" dur="7.26">Trump with Russia and I believe this is</text>
  <text start="379.72" dur="4.11">a coordinated effort think about what is</text>
  <text start="382.75" dur="4.71">happening right now</text>
  <text start="383.83" dur="5.4">Trump completely controls the Federal</text>
  <text start="387.46" dur="4.29">Reserve people might not believe this</text>
  <text start="389.23" dur="4.83">but look what has happened since he</text>
  <text start="391.75" dur="4.92">started contradicting the Fed he told</text>
  <text start="394.06" dur="4.26">the Fed listen this is ridiculous stop</text>
  <text start="396.67" dur="3.51">raising the interest rates if you</text>

  <text start="400.18" dur="4.26">the entire system is going to come down</text>
  <text start="402.04" dur="4.5">we all knew this is what the Fed was</text>
  <text start="404.44" dur="4.77">about to do we all knew this is what the</text>
  <text start="406.54" dur="4.59">deep state wanted we all knew that when</text>
  <text start="409.21" dur="3.99">the Fed raises the rates like this in an</text>
  <text start="411.13" dur="5.49">illusionary economy it brings the whole</text>
  <text start="413.2" dur="5.97">thing crashing down then we get word</text>
  <text start="416.62" dur="4.47">that the Fed is going to be in a holding</text>
  <text start="419.17" dur="4.41">pattern they&amp;#39;re not going to be raising</text>
  <text start="421.09" dur="4.17">rates anymore because they like to look</text>
  <text start="423.58" dur="4.05">at things they&amp;#39;d like to see how the</text>
  <text start="425.26" dur="5.51">economy is doing well think about it</text>

  <text start="444.33" dur="5.73">better than when Trump came into office</text>
  <text start="448.11" dur="6.529">and they had no problem</text>
  <text start="450.06" dur="8.599">raising the rates at that time so Trump</text>
  <text start="454.639" dur="7.511">got the Fed to put everything on hold</text>
  <text start="458.659" dur="5.741">then we hear the Fed is thinking about</text>
  <text start="462.15" dur="4.829">which they will do they&amp;#39;re thinking</text>
  <text start="464.4" dur="5.579">about slowing their unwinding and then</text>

  <text start="612" dur="6.87">throttles for more stimulus trade deals</text>
  <text start="615.45" dur="4.92">are in the works the Fed looks like</text>
  <text start="618.87" dur="2.97">they&amp;#39;re in a holding pattern they might</text>
  <text start="620.37" dur="3.39">even be reducing interest rates and</text>
  <text start="621.84" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re not gonna be unwinding their</text>

  <text start="646.53" dur="4.14">they don&amp;#39;t want gold to move that</text>
  <text start="648.39" dur="3.81">quickly because everyone would become</text>
  <text start="650.67" dur="5.73">aware of what is going on</text>
  <text start="652.2" dur="7.32">so when Europe starts to fail many</text>

  <text start="886.98" dur="7.11">knew that they only can take the central</text>
  <text start="890.58" dur="7.26">bank system so far before it completely</text>
  <text start="894.09" dur="7.23">falls apart and I do believe this is why</text>
  <text start="897.84" dur="6.6">China or G Jinping the leader of China</text>
  <text start="901.32" dur="7.71">is saying we must guard against Black</text>
  <text start="904.44" dur="9.03">Swan and fend off gray rhino events</text>
  <text start="909.03" dur="7.77">because he knows that this system can&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="916.8" dur="8.19">be changes there going to be complicated</text>
  <text start="918.89" dur="9.85">we know this is the transition and Trump</text>
  <text start="924.99" dur="5.94">he&amp;#39;s doing everything he possibly can to</text>

  <text start="937.46" dur="6.79">lopsided remember he&amp;#39;s undoing</text>
  <text start="941.58" dur="5.37">everything the globalists the central</text>
  <text start="944.25" dur="5.94">banks have done over the many many years</text>
  <text start="946.95" dur="6.12">and what&amp;#39;s happening is they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="950.19" dur="4.98">to keep this system moving along as long</text>
  <text start="953.07" dur="5.88">as they possibly can to set everything</text>
  <text start="955.17" dur="6.06">up but they know that something might</text>
  <text start="958.95" dur="4.889">come out of left field which brings the</text>
  <text start="961.23" dur="4.63">whole thing down it could be Europe it</text>
  <text start="963.839" dur="4.75">could be Italy</text>
  <text start="965.86" dur="5.76">could be the brexit which could have a</text>

  <text start="974.47" dur="5.04">believe this is why G Trump and Putin</text>
  <text start="977.44" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re all working together trying to</text>
  <text start="979.51" dur="3.81">keep this system alive long enough to</text>
  <text start="981.61" dur="4.32">hammer out the trade deals to get</text>
  <text start="983.32" dur="4.68">everything set up to undo what the</text>
  <text start="985.93" dur="5.279">globalists have done and set the</text>

  <text start="1001.23" dur="4.74">bring down the central bank system</text>
  <text start="1003.57" dur="4.8">because once gold starts to rise the</text>
