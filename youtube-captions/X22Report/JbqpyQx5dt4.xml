  <text start="82.289" dur="6.461">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="84.61" dur="7.44">financial news well it looks like it has</text>
  <text start="88.75" dur="6.03">begun and the central banks they are</text>
  <text start="92.05" dur="4.819">worried about their independence they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="94.78" dur="6.03">worried about political leaders</text>
  <text start="96.869" dur="7.78">questioning what they do or placing</text>
  <text start="100.81" dur="7.47">other individuals in the positions that</text>
  <text start="104.649" dur="5.191">were meant for insiders we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="108.28" dur="4.319">be talking about that in just a moment</text>
  <text start="109.84" dur="6.089">but first I wanted to talk about the</text>
  <text start="112.599" dur="6.511">economy and how the central bank economy</text>
  <text start="115.929" dur="6.75">is ripping itself apart they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="119.11" dur="6.539">completely exposed right now and Trump</text>
  <text start="122.679" dur="5.821">is racing against the clock to set</text>
  <text start="125.649" dur="5.461">everything in motion for the transition</text>
  <text start="128.5" dur="6.78">and he needs to keep the entire economic</text>
  <text start="131.11" dur="7.98">system together until the elections are</text>
  <text start="135.28" dur="5.22">over so this is a huge task right now</text>
  <text start="139.09" dur="3.57">and we know that he has the magic wand</text>
  <text start="140.5" dur="3.45">we know he can keep the market up we</text>
  <text start="142.66" dur="4.02">know that they can continually</text>
  <text start="143.95" dur="5.759">manipulate the numbers but we also know</text>
  <text start="146.68" dur="6.059">that this illusionary economy that the</text>
  <text start="149.709" dur="5.521">central bankers have created it is</text>
  <text start="152.739" dur="4.14">hurting the everyday person but Trump</text>
  <text start="155.23" dur="3.42">just can&amp;#39;t throw a switch shut it off</text>
  <text start="156.879" dur="3.901">and say okay let&amp;#39;s move into a</text>
  <text start="158.65" dur="3.66">completely new system because the entire</text>
  <text start="160.78" dur="2.98">system would collapse under the weight</text>
  <text start="162.31" dur="3.52">of debt</text>
  <text start="163.76" dur="3.539">and then what do people do now this is</text>
  <text start="165.83" dur="3.18">what the central bankers were planning</text>
  <text start="167.299" dur="3.39">to do they were planning to bring</text>
  <text start="169.01" dur="3.3">everything down and whoever got hurt got</text>
  <text start="170.689" dur="3.961">hurt they don&amp;#39;t really care actually</text>
  <text start="172.31" dur="4.86">they kind of like it because they buy up</text>
  <text start="174.65" dur="6.24">all the different assets for pennies on</text>
  <text start="177.17" dur="6.539">the dollar and they make out after a</text>
  <text start="180.89" dur="4.47">crash and also on the way down with the</text>
  <text start="183.709" dur="3.961">stock mark and everything like that they</text>
  <text start="185.36" dur="4.92">profit from it but when we look at the</text>
  <text start="187.67" dur="4.95">economic data we can see that a lot of</text>
  <text start="190.28" dur="5.549">things are happening all at once we know</text>
  <text start="192.62" dur="6.6">that Trump has controlled the Fed and</text>
  <text start="195.829" dur="5.071">they&amp;#39;re not raising rates as of yet we</text>
  <text start="199.22" dur="4.53">know this March they&amp;#39;re going to meet</text>
  <text start="200.9" dur="4.919">this will show if Trump truly has</text>
  <text start="203.75" dur="4.23">complete and utter control over the</text>
  <text start="205.819" dur="3.48">Federal Reserve if Powell comes out and</text>
  <text start="207.98" dur="3.119">said listen we&amp;#39;re gonna be patient a</text>
  <text start="209.299" dur="5.61">little bit longer and we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="211.099" dur="5.821">raise rates Trump has pretty much and</text>
  <text start="214.909" dur="3.871">the Patriots have full control over the</text>
  <text start="216.92" dur="4.679">Fed right now remember there are still</text>
  <text start="218.78" dur="4.26">bad guys within the Fed there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="221.599" dur="4.021">pressure a lot of pushing and shoving</text>
  <text start="223.04" dur="5.069">that&amp;#39;s going on right now because there</text>
  <text start="225.62" dur="5.339">are certain factions that want to bring</text>
  <text start="228.109" dur="5.25">down this system but when we look at</text>
  <text start="230.959" dur="4.471">their economy this is what they&amp;#39;re so</text>
  <text start="233.359" dur="4.47">afraid of this is why they want to bring</text>
  <text start="235.43" dur="5.269">it down sooner than later and blame it</text>
  <text start="237.829" dur="4.831">on Trump because their entire system is</text>
  <text start="240.699" dur="5.201">completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="242.66" dur="6.81">December new home sales now they were</text>
  <text start="245.9" dur="5.79">expected to tumble but thanks to a</text>
  <text start="249.47" dur="4.71">dramatic downward reversion in</text>
  <text start="251.69" dur="5.699">November&amp;#39;s data December came in at</text>
  <text start="254.18" dur="7.019">positive 3.7 it was expected to be down</text>
  <text start="257.389" dur="5.791">by eight point seven percent November&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.199" dur="5.521">initial sixteen point nine percent surge</text>
  <text start="263.18" dur="6.78">the most since 1992 was revised down</text>
  <text start="266.72" dur="4.919">just to nine point one percent so you</text>
  <text start="269.96" dur="3.929">can see what&amp;#39;s happening here they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="271.639" dur="2.971">playing with the numbers now we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="273.889" dur="4.28">this before</text>
  <text start="274.61" dur="7.739">where they take the last month&amp;#39;s data</text>
  <text start="278.169" dur="6.101">they revised it down the present month</text>
  <text start="282.349" dur="5.011">or at the last month they&amp;#39;re recording</text>
  <text start="284.27" dur="5.73">on that is pushed up and it makes it</text>
  <text start="287.36" dur="5.25">seem like everything is fantastic but</text>
  <text start="290" dur="4.86">new home sales are down year-over-year</text>
  <text start="292.61" dur="3.69">for the fourth straight month in a row</text>
  <text start="294.86" dur="2.82">and if you look at the trajectory and</text>
  <text start="296.3" dur="6.66">this is starting</text>
  <text start="297.68" dur="7.98">in 2012 you can see that the new home</text>
  <text start="302.96" dur="7.64">sales they are completely declining and</text>
  <text start="305.66" dur="8.91">it&amp;#39;s not improving at all again Trump is</text>
  <text start="310.6" dur="6.49">racing against the clock he knew when he</text>
  <text start="314.57" dur="5.37">came into office that the central bank</text>
  <text start="317.09" dur="6.21">their entire economic system was</text>
  <text start="319.94" dur="4.71">imploding on itself but of course what</text>
  <text start="323.3" dur="2.52">was he going to do when he first came</text>
  <text start="324.65" dur="4.53">into office he could have said to</text>
  <text start="325.82" dur="5.64">everyone listen we&amp;#39;re in a fake economy</text>
  <text start="329.18" dur="4.22">what we&amp;#39;re gonna have to do is we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="331.46" dur="4.11">gonna have to default on the debt and</text>
  <text start="333.4" dur="4.36">we&amp;#39;re just gonna have to let the chips</text>
  <text start="335.57" dur="3.75">fall where they may now a lot of people</text>
  <text start="337.76" dur="4.32">would have gotten hurt a lot of people</text>
  <text start="339.32" dur="5.159">were not prepared for this so he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="342.08" dur="6.51">take that route what he is doing right</text>
  <text start="344.479" dur="6.241">now is he&amp;#39;s preparing the economy by</text>
  <text start="348.59" dur="5.28">getting rid of the globalist trade</text>
  <text start="350.72" dur="7.069">system by bringing back manufacturing by</text>
  <text start="353.87" dur="7.38">reworking a lot of the laws by removing</text>
  <text start="357.789" dur="6.88">taxes by removing a lot of the</text>
  <text start="361.25" dur="6.389">regulations he needs to do this and he</text>
  <text start="364.669" dur="5.821">needs to make a playing field that is</text>
  <text start="367.639" dur="5.691">even amongst the countries these are the</text>
  <text start="370.49" dur="5.549">bilateral trade agreements that he is</text>
  <text start="373.33" dur="5.32">working out right now between many many</text>
  <text start="376.039" dur="6.211">countries now we have to remember the</text>
  <text start="378.65" dur="8.04">Fed is the mortal enemy of the young</text>
  <text start="382.25" dur="11.01">generation and the nation itself the</text>
  <text start="386.69" dur="9.599">wealth effect was created by the Fed the</text>

  <text start="414.05" dur="5.13">any central bank system it&amp;#39;s fantastic</text>
  <text start="416.659" dur="6.331">in the beginning because people really</text>
  <text start="419.18" dur="7.5">think that wow I am making so much money</text>
  <text start="422.99" dur="5.729">remember coming off a gold standard they</text>
  <text start="426.68" dur="3.63">create a lot of currency by creating a</text>
  <text start="428.719" dur="2.85">lot of currency there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="430.31" dur="3.689">currency in circulation you have</text>
  <text start="431.569" dur="4.8">inflation they raised the interest rates</text>
  <text start="433.999" dur="4.021">so you&amp;#39;re making a lot on the money</text>

  <text start="533.3" dur="6.57">back in time and you go back all the way</text>
  <text start="536.269" dur="6.211">to 1978 you can see the annual growth of</text>

  <text start="594.47" dur="6.69">didn&amp;#39;t pick an insider and the central</text>
  <text start="598.52" dur="4.92">bank is very worried about their</text>
  <text start="601.16" dur="5.78">independence basically what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="603.44" dur="5.7">is that the president of the philippine</text>
