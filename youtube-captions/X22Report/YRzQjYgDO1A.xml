  <text start="206.9" dur="5.26">everything is being rolled back but what</text>
  <text start="210.18" dur="4.05">we see happening here as everything is</text>
  <text start="212.16" dur="3.33">being rolled back and Trump is out there</text>
  <text start="214.23" dur="3.33">saying listen we need an even playing</text>
  <text start="215.49" dur="4.92">field because he knows and the others</text>
  <text start="217.56" dur="5.01">know that when the central bank system</text>
  <text start="220.41" dur="4.14">comes down the United States will no</text>
  <text start="222.57" dur="5.73">longer have the advantage that it has</text>
  <text start="224.55" dur="6.48">now the advantage is is that all</text>
  <text start="228.3" dur="7.74">countries keep the dollar in reserves</text>
  <text start="231.03" dur="8.16">and they use it to pay for oil and this</text>
  <text start="236.04" dur="5.79">is not going to be so when we transition</text>
  <text start="239.19" dur="5.04">a lot of things are going to change but</text>
  <text start="241.83" dur="4.41">as we&amp;#39;re going through this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="244.23" dur="3.51">trying to bring back and they have been</text>

  <text start="249.69" dur="9.9">States countries are getting hurt I mean</text>
  <text start="254.19" dur="8.67">Germany France China maybe maybe not</text>
  <text start="259.59" dur="5.73">because they have other plans but many</text>
  <text start="262.86" dur="5.85">of the European countries they are</text>
  <text start="265.32" dur="6.36">definitely going to get hurt because of</text>

  <text start="277.38" dur="4.62">different agenda and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="279.87" dur="5.66">see what is happening to these countries</text>
  <text start="282" dur="6.65">as Trump the Patriots push the plan</text>
  <text start="285.53" dur="5.5">where he&amp;#39;s implementing tariffs and</text>
  <text start="288.65" dur="6.43">changing a lot of different things here</text>
  <text start="291.03" dur="7.46">now out in Germany and throughout the EU</text>
  <text start="295.08" dur="4.76">we see growth is starting to shrink</text>
  <text start="298.49" dur="4.2">we talked about this before and it might</text>
  <text start="299.84" dur="6.54">even go negative and right now in</text>
  <text start="302.69" dur="8.099">Germany their growth is shrinking this</text>
  <text start="306.38" dur="6.36">is the first time in three years and car</text>

  <text start="324.319" dur="6.541">economy contracted by 0.2% in the third</text>
  <text start="327.259" dur="5.491">quarter now of course the Bundesbank and</text>
  <text start="330.86" dur="3.36">the rest they&amp;#39;re saying oh no this is</text>
  <text start="332.75" dur="2.849">just a one-off thing it&amp;#39;s nothing to</text>
  <text start="334.22" dur="4.71">worry about everything&amp;#39;s gonna be fine</text>
  <text start="335.599" dur="4.921">and the ECB they&amp;#39;re out there saying</text>
  <text start="338.93" dur="3.239">listen we&amp;#39;re still on track to do what</text>
  <text start="340.52" dur="5.19">we got to do we&amp;#39;re gonna be raising</text>
  <text start="342.169" dur="5.31">interest rates late next year and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="345.71" dur="4.47">gonna stop the stimulus well we know</text>
  <text start="347.479" dur="4.801">this is not going to happen yes maybe</text>
  <text start="350.18" dur="4.139">they&amp;#39;ll have a one-off where they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="352.28" dur="3.78">raise the interest rate just a little</text>
  <text start="354.319" dur="6.72">bit and then everything will fall apart</text>
  <text start="356.06" dur="7.38">right now the EU they are in zero or</text>
  <text start="361.039" dur="6.06">negative territory with interest rates</text>
  <text start="363.44" dur="4.86">and there are economies Italy France I</text>
  <text start="367.099" dur="3.54">mean France right now is 10%</text>
  <text start="368.3" dur="3.72">unemployment I mean of course if you</text>
  <text start="370.639" dur="3.59">factor in everything else is probably</text>
  <text start="372.02" dur="4.47">closer to like 18%</text>
  <text start="374.229" dur="4.361">Italy is having a problem Germany is</text>
  <text start="376.49" dur="4.649">having a problem these countries are</text>
  <text start="378.59" dur="5.129">going to have many many problems as we</text>
  <text start="381.139" dur="5.34">move forward here in the United States</text>
  <text start="383.719" dur="4.531">we can see we have many problems here</text>
  <text start="386.479" dur="3.421">already I mean yes we&amp;#39;re able to</text>
  <text start="388.25" dur="2.969">manipulate the numbers yes we have the</text>
  <text start="389.9" dur="3">central bank where we can completely</text>
  <text start="391.219" dur="3.781">borrow like there&amp;#39;s no tomorrow</text>
  <text start="392.9" dur="4.769">countries in the EU they have a little</text>
  <text start="395" dur="4.56">bit harder time borrowing because they</text>
  <text start="397.669" dur="4.081">have to make the case they have to you</text>
  <text start="399.56" dur="4.05">know push austerity on the people it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="401.75" dur="4.319">little different than having the central</text>
  <text start="403.61" dur="4.89">bank right here in the United States</text>
  <text start="406.069" dur="6.15">where we&amp;#39;d say alright we need to borrow</text>
  <text start="408.5" dur="6.09">this much so we see here in the United</text>
  <text start="412.219" dur="4.23">States a lot of things are starting to</text>
  <text start="414.59" dur="4.729">fall apart forget about the statistical</text>
  <text start="416.449" dur="4.681">numbers I mean we know that retail is</text>
  <text start="419.319" dur="5.38">absolutely awful the brick-and-mortar</text>
  <text start="421.13" dur="6.45">stores they are doing terribly and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="424.699" dur="6.261">because people they just don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="427.58" dur="6.08">extra funds to go out and purr</text>
  <text start="430.96" dur="4.65">yes they can use credit cards yes with</text>
  <text start="433.66" dur="4.08">the new FICO scores people are gonna be</text>
  <text start="435.61" dur="5.04">getting new credit cards we might see a</text>
  <text start="437.74" dur="6.15">little bump up of retail but it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="440.65" dur="4.68">going to last this is not a fix but of</text>
  <text start="443.89" dur="3.15">course they&amp;#39;re gonna make it seem like</text>
  <text start="445.33" dur="3.03">this as they fix but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="447.04" dur="3.78">interesting about a lot of these stores</text>
  <text start="448.36" dur="4.74">the brick-and-mortar stores and know all</text>
  <text start="450.82" dur="3.93">their sales are not moving to online and</text>
  <text start="453.1" dur="4.62">everything that&amp;#39;s fine it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="454.75" dur="5.07">one-to-one ratio a lot of these stores</text>
  <text start="457.72" dur="5.49">are using tricks to make it look like</text>
  <text start="459.82" dur="6.74">sales at their stores are doing a lot</text>
  <text start="463.21" dur="5.49">better actually Macy&amp;#39;s is one of them so</text>
  <text start="466.56" dur="5.2">Macy&amp;#39;s reported third quarter earnings</text>
  <text start="468.7" dur="5.06">this morning I made a big deal out of</text>
  <text start="471.76" dur="4.89">the same store sales increase showing a</text>
  <text start="473.76" dur="5.02">3.1 percent year-over-year increase it</text>
  <text start="476.65" dur="4.95">was the first line in its report</text>
  <text start="478.78" dur="7.32">comparable sales it calls them wisely</text>
  <text start="481.6" dur="7.31">leaving store out of the term hmm why</text>
  <text start="486.1" dur="6.78">would they leave store out of the term</text>
  <text start="488.91" dur="8.19">if they&amp;#39;re talking about same store</text>
  <text start="492.88" dur="7.59">sales well let&amp;#39;s take a look and see why</text>
  <text start="497.1" dur="4.65">their overall net sales rose two point</text>
  <text start="500.47" dur="3.41">three percent in the third quarter</text>
  <text start="501.75" dur="4.9">compared to the same quarter last year</text>
  <text start="503.88" dur="5.08">this rate of growth was just under the</text>
  <text start="506.65" dur="5.07">rate of consumer price inflation of 2.5</text>
  <text start="508.96" dur="6.42">percent so it&amp;#39;s not a lot to write home</text>
  <text start="511.72" dur="7.68">about as all major retailers Macy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="515.38" dur="5.82">divided sales into two categories sales</text>
  <text start="519.4" dur="6.78">at its brick-and-mortar stores and</text>
  <text start="521.2" dur="7.91">digital sales makes sense but this is</text>
  <text start="526.18" dur="6.33">the part that we need to all know about</text>
  <text start="529.11" dur="5.89">when Macy&amp;#39;s claimed in the first line of</text>
  <text start="532.51" dur="7.29">its report comparable sales growth of</text>
  <text start="535" dur="8.1">3.1 percent on an owned basis 3.3</text>
  <text start="539.8" dur="6.24">percent on an own plus license basis</text>
  <text start="543.1" dur="7.08">it&amp;#39;s comparable sales as it calls them</text>
  <text start="546.04" dur="6.48">wisely include all online sales and what</text>
  <text start="550.18" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re showing here is that the</text>
  <text start="552.52" dur="5.52">brick-and-mortar stores with online</text>
  <text start="554.17" dur="6.06">sales they are doing ok that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="558.04" dur="5.65">they&amp;#39;re getting this number they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="560.23" dur="6.13">actually tricking everyone</text>
  <text start="563.69" dur="4.89">these numbers are not same store sales</text>
  <text start="566.36" dur="5.82">these numbers include all its online</text>
  <text start="568.58" dur="5.46">sales so they&amp;#39;re combining everything to</text>
  <text start="572.18" dur="3.66">make it look like retail in the</text>
  <text start="574.04" dur="4.05">brick-and-mortar stores are doing much</text>
  <text start="575.84" dur="4.23">better than they really are and all</text>
  <text start="578.09" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re doing is taking the poor sales</text>
  <text start="580.07" dur="3.84">on brick and mortar and the halfway</text>
  <text start="581.84" dur="8.39">decent sales on online sales and</text>
  <text start="583.91" dur="10.05">combining them it&amp;#39;s one big illusion and</text>
  <text start="590.23" dur="5.35">this is why we don&amp;#39;t see today all the</text>
  <text start="593.96" dur="4.74">sales that were happening in brick and</text>
  <text start="595.58" dur="6.12">mortar moving all over to online sales</text>
  <text start="598.7" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s just not happening out in the</text>
  <text start="601.7" dur="3.96">housing market we see mortgage</text>
  <text start="604.22" dur="3.39">applications they decrease by three</text>
  <text start="605.66" dur="4.08">point two percent from a week earlier</text>
  <text start="607.61" dur="4.2">and it&amp;#39;s getting worse and worse</text>
  <text start="609.74" dur="4.74">as we move along actually Home Depot</text>
  <text start="611.81" dur="4.14">right now and all we all know this that</text>
  <text start="614.48" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re the biggest home-improvement</text>
  <text start="615.95" dur="7.29">chain in the United States and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="619.4" dur="6.78">saying that US home sales right now they</text>
  <text start="623.24" dur="6.54">are slowing they&amp;#39;re noticing there are</text>
  <text start="626.18" dur="6.12">problems so they&amp;#39;re saying that there</text>
  <text start="629.78" dur="5.13">are signs right now that housing demand</text>
  <text start="632.3" dur="5.64">is slowing and they&amp;#39;re saying the</text>
  <text start="634.91" dur="6.78">mortgage rates as they climb higher well</text>
  <text start="637.94" dur="7.5">it&amp;#39;s going to hurt purchasing power so</text>
  <text start="641.69" dur="6.12">we have DR Horton Lennar and many of the</text>
  <text start="645.44" dur="6.24">other large home builders they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="647.81" dur="6.9">saying the same exact thing here we are</text>
  <text start="651.68" dur="4.74">everyone we&amp;#39;re starting to see a</text>
  <text start="654.71" dur="4.74">complete and utter breakdown of the</text>
  <text start="656.42" dur="4.68">system and there are many signs that the</text>
  <text start="659.45" dur="5.4">US economy is starting to slow down</text>
  <text start="661.1" dur="5.31">now remember Trump the Patriots they</text>
  <text start="664.85" dur="3.12">knew that this was going to happen they</text>
  <text start="666.41" dur="4.59">know that this is an illusion they know</text>
  <text start="667.97" dur="5.19">that this is not a real economy why are</text>
  <text start="671" dur="6">they out there saying the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
