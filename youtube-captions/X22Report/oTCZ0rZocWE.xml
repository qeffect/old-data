  <text start="144.489" dur="4.111">everyone that Obama care is fantastic</text>
  <text start="146.769" dur="3.091">it&amp;#39;s strong and look everyone&amp;#39;s signing</text>
  <text start="148.6" dur="3.8">up no these are the people that need the</text>
  <text start="149.86" dur="6.15">insurance and they have no choice and</text>
  <text start="152.4" dur="5.559">they need to sign up once again even if</text>
  <text start="156.01" dur="4.02">the premiums are much higher because a</text>
  <text start="157.959" dur="4.801">lot of them I might have medical</text>
  <text start="160.03" dur="4.62">conditions now the rest of the country</text>
  <text start="162.76" dur="3.75">who&amp;#39;s looking at this is saying you know</text>
  <text start="164.65" dur="3.48">something I can&amp;#39;t afford this this is</text>
  <text start="166.51" dur="4.89">way out of my league right now I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="168.13" dur="6.18">rather take the tax penalty then signup</text>
  <text start="171.4" dur="4.83">to Obamacare and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="174.31" dur="5.22">seeing this is the reality of it and</text>
  <text start="176.23" dur="5.66">when the tax information comes out we</text>
  <text start="179.53" dur="4.89">will know how many people opt out of</text>
  <text start="181.89" dur="4">Obamacare and I&amp;#39;m gonna tell you right</text>
  <text start="184.42" dur="2.19">now from everything that I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="185.89" dur="2.64">looking at</text>
  <text start="186.61" dur="4.86">that number is gonna be much much higher</text>
  <text start="188.53" dur="4.47">than those who actually signed up and</text>
  <text start="191.47" dur="3.36">I&amp;#39;m not talking about the people that</text>
  <text start="193" dur="3.45">got subsidized because they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="194.83" dur="4.02">really paying anything and the people</text>
  <text start="196.45" dur="4.11">that had Obamacare I&amp;#39;m not talking about</text>
  <text start="198.85" dur="4.23">them because they already had it I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="200.56" dur="5.55">talking about all those people who</text>
  <text start="203.08" dur="5.01">decided not to take Obamacare because it</text>
  <text start="206.11" dur="4.53">was just too expensive and it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="208.09" dur="5.34">give them a benefit that is going to be</text>
  <text start="210.64" dur="6.12">much higher than everyone in Obamacare</text>
  <text start="213.43" dur="5.07">and we&amp;#39;re gonna see this from the tax</text>
  <text start="216.76" dur="3.12">information just like we saw it from the</text>
  <text start="218.5" dur="4.23">tax information and when we break these</text>
  <text start="219.88" dur="5.76">numbers apart we find out the real truth</text>
  <text start="222.73" dur="4.89">not the fake information that the</text>
  <text start="225.64" dur="3.72">government wants to put out that the</text>
  <text start="227.62" dur="3.75">corporate media wants to put out that</text>
  <text start="229.36" dur="3.48">they tell you that look everyone is</text>
  <text start="231.37" dur="3.63">there you know because people have moved</text>
  <text start="232.84" dur="4.23">over from you know Medicare Medicaid</text>
  <text start="235" dur="3.3">these are people that are subsidized</text>
  <text start="237.07" dur="3.87">they throw them all into the same bucket</text>
  <text start="238.3" dur="4.14">but it&amp;#39;s not the same bucket I mean if</text>
  <text start="240.94" dur="3.66">you gave everyone insurance and they</text>
  <text start="242.44" dur="4.35">didn&amp;#39;t have to pay for it I mean yeah</text>
  <text start="244.6" dur="6.359">that&amp;#39;s fantastic but everyone doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="246.79" dur="6.449">get that everyone has to pay and those</text>
  <text start="250.959" dur="4.291">people who have to pay guess what they</text>
  <text start="253.239" dur="5.28">can&amp;#39;t afford it why do you think</text>
  <text start="255.25" dur="5.7">Congress and the president opted out of</text>
  <text start="258.519" dur="5.971">Obamacare and I&amp;#39;m not talking about</text>
  <text start="260.95" dur="6.48">Trump talking about Obama because that</text>
  <text start="264.49" dur="5.13">benefit wasn&amp;#39;t better than what they</text>
  <text start="267.43" dur="4.71">already what they what they were getting</text>
  <text start="269.62" dur="4.14">in government what they should have done</text>
  <text start="272.14" dur="3.839">is they should have said listen follow</text>
  <text start="273.76" dur="3.96">our lead because we&amp;#39;re leaders we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="275.979" dur="3.781">gonna take the health insurance but they</text>
  <text start="277.72" dur="3.93">saw and said we don&amp;#39;t want this no way</text>
  <text start="279.76" dur="4.77">the premium is gonna keep going up I</text>
  <text start="281.65" dur="6.11">don&amp;#39;t want this stuff now we see that</text>
  <text start="284.53" dur="5.91">this whole thing about sexual harassment</text>
  <text start="287.76" dur="3.88">groping and all this stuff started out</text>
  <text start="290.44" dur="4.229">in Hollywood it&amp;#39;s starting to make his</text>
  <text start="291.64" dur="5.61">move over to DC and we see Al Franken</text>
  <text start="294.669" dur="5.661">right now he&amp;#39;s been caught up in this</text>
  <text start="297.25" dur="5.81">whole thing where looks like he was</text>
  <text start="300.33" dur="6.58">inappropriate with Leeanne Tweed in&amp;#39; and</text>
  <text start="303.06" dur="6.76">she is a sportscaster and it looks like</text>
  <text start="306.91" dur="5.31">there&amp;#39;s pictures out now showing that he</text>
  <text start="309.82" dur="5.19">was groping her he was kissing her and</text>
  <text start="312.22" dur="4.379">she did not consent to this now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="315.01" dur="3.54">very interesting about this is that all</text>
  <text start="316.599" dur="3.901">these individuals you know they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="318.55" dur="5.16">talking tough until they get caught up</text>
  <text start="320.5" dur="4.44">and all this stuff and Al Franken if we</text>
  <text start="323.71" dur="4.41">need to go back just a couple of days</text>
  <text start="324.94" dur="7.59">he&amp;#39;s the one that wants to let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="328.12" dur="7.44">take control of what is said on social</text>
  <text start="332.53" dur="6.45">media Twitter Facebook the alternative</text>
  <text start="335.56" dur="6.33">media he wants the government to control</text>
  <text start="338.98" dur="5.04">the news to control the information so</text>
  <text start="341.89" dur="4.8">there&amp;#39;s no fake information that gets</text>
  <text start="344.02" dur="6.27">out there gee I wonder why he wants</text>
  <text start="346.69" dur="6.63">control think about that for a second we</text>
  <text start="350.29" dur="4.86">see with Fusion GPS the founder admits</text>
  <text start="353.32" dur="4.71">that the Trump dossier was built</text>
  <text start="355.15" dur="3.48">entirely on rumors they didn&amp;#39;t go to</text>
  <text start="358.03" dur="3.06">Russia</text>
  <text start="358.63" dur="4.92">there was no fact-checking well we all</text>
  <text start="361.09" dur="5.01">know this this whole thing was paid for</text>
  <text start="363.55" dur="4.77">by Clinton&amp;#39;s attorney this was going to</text>
  <text start="366.1" dur="6.15">be used they used it to get the fires or</text>
  <text start="368.32" dur="6.27">warrants they used it to derail Trump</text>
  <text start="372.25" dur="4.8">they used it for whatever they needed it</text>
  <text start="374.59" dur="4.829">for and now the informations coming out</text>
  <text start="377.05" dur="4.68">and we see that the identity of the</text>
  <text start="379.419" dur="4.891">secret informant in FBI&amp;#39;s Clinton probe</text>
  <text start="381.73" dur="5.88">with the uranium one well this</text>
  <text start="384.31" dur="6.03">individual is now out there and his name</text>
  <text start="387.61" dur="6.03">is Christopher Campbell he was a former</text>
  <text start="390.34" dur="5.28">lobbyist for 10x the US base arm of Raza</text>
  <text start="393.64" dur="4.14">Tom the Russian government&amp;#39;s nuclear</text>
  <text start="395.62" dur="4.56">agency and at the time uranium one deal</text>
  <text start="397.78" dur="5.31">was approved Campbell was a confidential</text>
  <text start="400.18" dur="5.85">source for the FBI and he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="403.09" dur="5.73">listen I have a lot of information about</text>
  <text start="406.03" dur="5.67">what happ what happened with this</text>
  <text start="408.82" dur="5.52">uranium one deal now since his name has</text>
  <text start="411.7" dur="4.05">been released he might show up dead</text>
  <text start="414.34" dur="4.68">because there are certain individuals</text>
  <text start="415.75" dur="5.52">that don&amp;#39;t want this information to get</text>
  <text start="419.02" dur="4.11">out there and the corporate media and</text>
  <text start="421.27" dur="4.02">the rest are saying that yeah this</text>
  <text start="423.13" dur="6.03">individual has no information whatsoever</text>
  <text start="425.29" dur="5.82">and Campbell countered those who doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="429.16" dur="4.02">dismiss his knowledge of the uranium one</text>
  <text start="431.11" dur="4.619">deal he said I have worked with the</text>
  <text start="433.18" dur="5.31">Justice Department undercover for</text>
  <text start="435.729" dur="5.401">several years and the documentation</text>
  <text start="438.49" dur="7.67">relating to uranium one and political</text>
  <text start="441.13" dur="7.23">influence does exist I have it and he</text>
  <text start="446.16" dur="4.75">declined to give details of those</text>
  <text start="448.36" dur="3.96">documents now if I was him I would keep</text>
  <text start="450.91" dur="3.24">that a secret I wouldn&amp;#39;t tell anyone</text>
  <text start="452.32" dur="3.3">where it is except</text>
  <text start="454.15" dur="3.36">for those people that should have</text>
  <text start="455.62" dur="4.83">knowledge of it just in case something</text>
  <text start="457.51" dur="5.64">happens to him if he ends up dead that</text>
  <text start="460.45" dur="5.22">information needs to be spread out and</text>
  <text start="463.15" dur="5.1">delivered to the right individuals and</text>
  <text start="465.67" dur="5.88">it should be multiple copies now I most</text>
  <text start="468.25" dur="6.24">likely he does have this set up and this</text>
  <text start="471.55" dur="4.89">is going to allow him to live a little</text>
  <text start="474.49" dur="4.08">bit longer and if this information does</text>
  <text start="476.44" dur="5.37">come out well it looks like it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="478.57" dur="7.11">to implicate many many individuals we</text>
  <text start="481.81" dur="5.7">say that Trump when he visited China the</text>
  <text start="485.68" dur="4.44">corporate media was trying to paint this</text>
  <text start="487.51" dur="6.69">as some ridiculous meeting that nothing</text>
  <text start="490.12" dur="6.9">was really accomplished there but Trump</text>
  <text start="494.2" dur="5.46">and Gigi Peng they accomplished quite a</text>
  <text start="497.02" dur="6.72">bit they were working out new economic</text>
  <text start="499.66" dur="8.72">deals new trade deals and it looks like</text>
  <text start="503.74" dur="7.53">that United States and China are</text>
  <text start="508.38" dur="4.92">cooperating and it looks like the United</text>
  <text start="511.27" dur="4.95">States might even be getting closer to</text>
  <text start="513.3" dur="3.82">working with the one belt one road</text>
  <text start="516.22" dur="3.83">system</text>
  <text start="517.12" dur="5.13">now since this meeting it looks like</text>
  <text start="520.05" dur="6.67">China is going to be sending an envoy</text>
  <text start="522.25" dur="6.51">and delegation to North Korea now this</text>
  <text start="526.72" dur="3.99">is a big move and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="528.76" dur="4.11">see how this all turns out because this</text>
  <text start="530.71" dur="5.22">was probably part of the whole</text>
  <text start="532.87" dur="7.14">negotiation where we&amp;#39;re gonna be working</text>
  <text start="535.93" dur="6.81">with China trying to build our economic</text>
  <text start="540.01" dur="5.73">system back up to join the new trade</text>
  <text start="542.74" dur="5.49">system and at the same time shut down</text>
  <text start="545.74" dur="5.16">the Cabal where they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="548.23" dur="4.62">war with North Korea the Kabala at this</text>
  <text start="550.9" dur="3.51">point is backed against the wall and</text>
  <text start="552.85" dur="3.3">they really don&amp;#39;t have that many</text>
  <text start="554.41" dur="3.48">alternatives now it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that</text>
  <text start="556.15" dur="3.15">they just give up and they just scurry</text>
  <text start="557.89" dur="1.68">off and they stop doing what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="559.3" dur="3.36">doing</text>
  <text start="559.57" dur="4.76">they always regroup and they try to push</text>
  <text start="562.66" dur="4.11">their plans we can see this out in</text>
  <text start="564.33" dur="4.75">Lebanon with Israel and Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="566.77" dur="4.41">where they&amp;#39;re trying to push this war</text>
  <text start="569.08" dur="5.91">with Iran using Lebanon as a proxy and</text>
  <text start="571.18" dur="6.6">we can see right now that Israel they</text>
  <text start="574.99" dur="5.55">are ready to exchange Intel with Saudi</text>
  <text start="577.78" dur="4.77">Arabia to face Iran and we can see that</text>
  <text start="580.54" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re pushing this agenda and what</text>
  <text start="582.55" dur="4.11">they want to do is they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="583.66" dur="5.969">push this event to distract from</text>
  <text start="586.66" dur="4.53">everything that is going on here and we</text>
  <text start="589.629" dur="3.45">can see that they&amp;#39;re gonna try to push</text>
  <text start="591.19" dur="5.569">this as hard as they possibly can now we</text>
  <text start="593.079" dur="8.041">understand there was a Saudi coup and</text>
  <text start="596.759" dur="9.101">this might be this might be used to set</text>
  <text start="601.12" dur="7.199">up a one-world currency and because they</text>
  <text start="605.86" dur="3.779">know the petro dollar well it&amp;#39;s that and</text>
  <text start="608.319" dur="3.601">we know that it all started with Saudi</text>
  <text start="609.639" dur="5.19">Arabia the Middle East was on board and</text>
  <text start="611.92" dur="5.31">Saudi Arabia is the hub of all of this</text>
  <text start="614.829" dur="6.421">and since they know the petro dollar is</text>
  <text start="617.23" dur="7.979">dying this might be a way to push this</text>
  <text start="621.25" dur="6.959">agenda now we have to understand that</text>
  <text start="625.209" dur="5.761">this was a quiet coup and it has been</text>
  <text start="628.209" dur="4.411">rather effective in completely changing</text>
  <text start="630.97" dur="4.559">the power base of the nation over the</text>
  <text start="632.62" dur="4.98">past few years the primary beneficiary</text>
  <text start="635.529" dur="4.29">of that change in power has been the</text>

  <text start="670.99" dur="4.89">policy defense matters oil economic</text>
  <text start="673.66" dur="5.31">decisions and social changes are now in</text>
  <text start="675.88" dur="6">the hands of one man so the real</text>
  <text start="678.97" dur="6.21">question is who is behind that man well</text>
  <text start="681.88" dur="6.42">you know it&amp;#39;s the globalists it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="685.18" dur="6.69">Cabal and they know at this point that</text>
  <text start="688.3" dur="5.039">the petrodollar system is dying there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="691.87" dur="3.689">nothing they can do about it and</text>
  <text start="693.339" dur="5.61">eventually what they wanted to do is go</text>
  <text start="695.559" dur="5.851">to a one currency type of system we know</text>
  <text start="698.949" dur="6.51">Saudi Arabia they were making deals with</text>
  <text start="701.41" dur="6.479">Russia they&amp;#39;ve been working closely with</text>
  <text start="705.459" dur="4.291">Russia but again Saudi Arabia is still</text>
  <text start="707.889" dur="4.2">working with the established when the</text>
  <text start="709.75" dur="5.519">globalists the Cabal and we can see</text>
  <text start="712.089" dur="6.661">right now that Saudi Arabia is working</text>
  <text start="715.269" dur="5.161">with Israel to go after Iran their arch</text>
  <text start="718.75" dur="4.83">enemy</text>
  <text start="720.43" dur="6.84">and we can see that this might be used</text>
  <text start="723.58" dur="6.84">right now to start this event and try to</text>
  <text start="727.27" dur="4.56">usher in a new currency I mean this was</text>
  <text start="730.42" dur="3.479">their plan all along does that mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="731.83" dur="4.199">going to work no this looks like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="733.899" dur="4.411">something that they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="736.029" dur="4.31">for but it looks like they&amp;#39;re really not</text>
  <text start="738.31" dur="5.31">going to get the footing they need</text>
  <text start="740.339" dur="6.521">unless they have some type of an event</text>
  <text start="743.62" dur="5.159">and it has to be very very big but the</text>
  <text start="746.86" dur="3.33">rest of the world when they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="748.779" dur="3.261">at this they&amp;#39;re saying you know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="750.19" dur="5.19">not getting involved this whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="752.04" dur="5.08">this might be a non-starter but once</text>
  <text start="755.38" dur="4.23">again you have to remember their way of</text>
  <text start="757.12" dur="5.339">thinking their way of thinking is try to</text>
  <text start="759.61" dur="6.09">push an event anywhere they possibly can</text>
  <text start="762.459" dur="5.581">and we can see right now they need to do</text>
  <text start="765.7" dur="4.29">this very very quickly because surya and</text>
  <text start="768.04" dur="6.06">russia has been asking the united states</text>
  <text start="769.99" dur="5.73">to leave syria right now now the united</text>
  <text start="774.1" dur="3.239">states the Cabal factions within the</text>
  <text start="775.72" dur="3.63">united states they don&amp;#39;t want to leave</text>
  <text start="777.339" dur="3.601">syria because once they leave syria well</text>
  <text start="779.35" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s a little bit tougher to get to iran</text>
  <text start="780.94" dur="4.98">and this is really what they wanted and</text>
  <text start="783.67" dur="5.16">we can see right now this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="785.92" dur="6.33">been pushing the agenda with lebanon now</text>
  <text start="788.83" dur="5.91">US defense secretary james madison at</text>
  <text start="792.25" dur="6.3">washington received a mandate to operate</text>
  <text start="794.74" dur="8.88">in syria from the UN there&amp;#39;s a problem</text>
  <text start="798.55" dur="8.039">there he lied because the UN never did</text>
  <text start="803.62" dur="5.85">any such thing as it does it does not</text>
  <text start="806.589" dur="6.091">even have any legal capacity to do that</text>
  <text start="809.47" dur="5.91">the UN cannot sanction a foreign</text>
  <text start="812.68" dur="4.73">invasion of Syria or any other country</text>
  <text start="815.38" dur="5.579">because it is absolutely impossible</text>
  <text start="817.41" dur="6.01">under international law UN General</text>
  <text start="820.959" dur="4.591">Assembly resolution through 3 1 4 on the</text>
  <text start="823.42" dur="4.8">definition of aggression explicitly</text>
  <text start="825.55" dur="4.68">states that an invasion or attack by the</text>
  <text start="828.22" dur="4.35">Armed Forces of the state of the</text>
  <text start="830.23" dur="4.68">territory of another state as well as</text>
  <text start="832.57" dur="5.519">any military occupation however</text>
  <text start="834.91" dur="5.16">temporary or bombardment by the Armed</text>
  <text start="838.089" dur="4.351">Forces of State against the territory of</text>
  <text start="840.07" dur="4.35">any of another state is what</text>
  <text start="842.44" dur="4.44">particularly constitutes aggression</text>
  <text start="844.42" dur="5.52">however all these facts did not prevent</text>
  <text start="846.88" dur="5.82">mattis from claiming that it was the UN</text>
  <text start="849.94" dur="3.93">that sank sanctified the presence of the</text>
  <text start="852.7" dur="3.57">US troops</text>
  <text start="853.87" dur="5.909">the Syrian territory without the consent</text>
  <text start="856.27" dur="6.18">of the Syrian government now you know</text>
  <text start="859.779" dur="6.631">the UN said that basically we can go</text>
  <text start="862.45" dur="6.69">after Isis and we can take them out this</text>
  <text start="866.41" dur="5.88">is what Maness is saying now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="869.14" dur="6.54">referring to resolution two two four</text>
  <text start="872.29" dur="6.96">nine called on UN member states that</text>
  <text start="875.68" dur="6.03">have the capacity to do so to take all</text>
  <text start="879.25" dur="3.99">necessary measures and to redouble and</text>
  <text start="881.71" dur="3.33">coordinate their efforts to prevent and</text>
  <text start="883.24" dur="3.87">suppress terrorist acts committed</text>
  <text start="885.04" dur="5.1">specifically by the Islamic state as</text>
  <text start="887.11" dur="6.72">well as other terrorist groups however</text>
  <text start="890.14" dur="6.5">it urged the states to do so in</text>
  <text start="893.83" dur="6.99">compliance with international law</text>
  <text start="896.64" dur="9.49">something that the US officials didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="900.82" dur="8.09">follow they kind of basically overlooked</text>
  <text start="906.13" dur="6.72">that part because if you look at</text>
  <text start="908.91" dur="7.81">resolution three three one four that is</text>
  <text start="912.85" dur="5.85">part of the international law and what</text>
  <text start="916.72" dur="3.989">the United States has done as they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="918.7" dur="5.25">gone into a country illegally and</text>
  <text start="920.709" dur="5.101">they&amp;#39;re aggressive and a country who&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="923.95" dur="2.759">sovereign country where they have an</text>
  <text start="925.81" dur="5.94">elected leader</text>
  <text start="926.709" dur="8.791">they&amp;#39;re asking them to leave the United</text>
  <text start="931.75" dur="7.11">States the Cabal they&amp;#39;re stuck they</text>
  <text start="935.5" dur="6.2">don&amp;#39;t have a legal footing to stand on</text>
  <text start="938.86" dur="6.54">legal foot I should say to stand on and</text>
  <text start="941.7" dur="5.29">this is where the problem is so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="945.4" dur="4.59">gonna do whatever they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="946.99" dur="5.28">convince the world that they have the</text>
  <text start="949.99" dur="5.16">legal right to be there but they really</text>
  <text start="952.27" dur="5.28">don&amp;#39;t and it looks like Syria Russia</text>
  <text start="955.15" dur="6.93">China and the rest are gonna go to the</text>
  <text start="957.55" dur="6.03">UN and they&amp;#39;re going to say hey look at</text>
  <text start="962.08" dur="3.96">this look what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="963.58" dur="3.84">and the rest of the world is going to</text>
  <text start="966.04" dur="4.89">look at this and say yet they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="967.42" dur="6.3">the right to be there specifically since</text>
  <text start="970.93" dur="4.29">Syria is asking them to leave and this</text>
  <text start="973.72" dur="3.66">is why they&amp;#39;ve been trying to push the</text>
  <text start="975.22" dur="5.1">event as hard as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="977.38" dur="4.949">before this happens now what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="980.32" dur="4.17">trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="982.329" dur="4.831">us believe that North Korea has the</text>
  <text start="984.49" dur="4.05">ability to cyberattack hit the power</text>
  <text start="987.16" dur="3.27">infrastructure hit the financial</text>
  <text start="988.54" dur="4.289">institutions we see that they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="990.43" dur="4.889">bringing Russia into this remember they</text>
  <text start="992.829" dur="4.981">really haven&amp;#39;t stopped pushing the idea</text>
  <text start="995.319" dur="4.44">that Russia&amp;#39;s our enemy Russia is not</text>

  <text start="1012.959" dur="7.11">country for their interests not the</text>
  <text start="1016.589" dur="5.581">interests of the people and we can see</text>
  <text start="1020.069" dur="2.99">that they&amp;#39;re pushing the idea that</text>
  <text start="1022.17" dur="4.169">Russia</text>
  <text start="1023.059" dur="5.471">they&amp;#39;ve been targeting Britain&amp;#39;s energy</text>

  <text start="1038.819" dur="4.02">because of these cyber attacks and</text>
  <text start="1040.829" dur="4.171">that&amp;#39;s going to be the cause of the</text>
  <text start="1042.839" dur="5.661">collapse this is the propaganda they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1045" dur="6.08">trying to build right now and once again</text>
  <text start="1048.5" dur="5.83">the reason they&amp;#39;re doing this is because</text>
  <text start="1051.08" dur="7.42">they are stuck they&amp;#39;re running out of</text>
  <text start="1054.33" dur="7.17">time and they&amp;#39;re getting worried that if</text>
  <text start="1058.5" dur="5.52">they don&amp;#39;t do something soon they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1061.5" dur="4.409">have the power to do it and if you can</text>
  <text start="1064.02" dur="5.19">see out in Afghanistan the opium</text>
  <text start="1065.909" dur="5.4">production the sales of opium has hit a</text>
  <text start="1069.21" dur="4.65">new high level because think about it</text>
  <text start="1071.309" dur="6.091">the Islamic state lost their revenue in</text>
  <text start="1073.86" dur="5.699">Syria Iraq Libya so they had to make up</text>
  <text start="1077.4" dur="5.72">that revenue someplace else and that</text>
  <text start="1079.559" dur="7.771">comes from the sale of the poppy fields</text>
  <text start="1083.12" dur="8.08">in Afghanistan the intelligence agencies</text>
