  <text start="41.15" dur="5.28">is the current economic collapse news</text>
  <text start="43.73" dur="6">brief let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="46.43" dur="5.1">collapse news now in Puerto Rico we</text>
  <text start="49.73" dur="4.41">understand Puerto Rico is defaulting I</text>
  <text start="51.53" dur="4.05">mean we&amp;#39;re looking at Ukraine Ukraine is</text>
  <text start="54.14" dur="3.62">defaulting this is why they want Russia</text>
  <text start="55.58" dur="5.939">to take twenty percent off the debt</text>
  <text start="57.76" dur="4.959">Greece basically is collapsing even</text>
  <text start="61.519" dur="2.97">though they&amp;#39;re continually piling on</text>
  <text start="62.719" dur="3.361">more and more debt and we see Puerto</text>
  <text start="64.489" dur="3.901">Rico right now where they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="66.08" dur="3.99">enough revenue coming in the creditors</text>
  <text start="68.39" dur="5.399">right now they&amp;#39;re very resistant to</text>
  <text start="70.07" dur="5.96">cutting any of their debt whatsoever</text>
  <text start="73.789" dur="5.311">they want Puerto Rico to pay in full</text>
  <text start="76.03" dur="6.6">there&amp;#39;s another 303 million which comes</text>
  <text start="79.1" dur="7.14">due one month later on january and the</text>
  <text start="82.63" dur="6.489">commonwealth warns it is facing a</text>
  <text start="86.24" dur="5.37">liquidity crisis set to run out of cash</text>
  <text start="89.119" dur="4.651">this month and revenues that are coming</text>
  <text start="91.61" dur="4.73">in right now are much much lower than</text>
  <text start="93.77" dur="4.849">expected the debt is way too high and</text>
  <text start="96.34" dur="5.169">everything needs to be restructured</text>
  <text start="98.619" dur="6.011">basically the economy is collapsing</text>
  <text start="101.509" dur="5.461">there and they&amp;#39;re worried because Puerto</text>
  <text start="104.63" dur="4.829">Rico might not have the ability to raise</text>
  <text start="106.97" dur="5.879">enough revenue to pay for health care</text>
  <text start="109.459" dur="7.171">retiree costs essential government</text>
  <text start="112.849" dur="5.701">services and everything else and what</text>
  <text start="116.63" dur="5.25">might happen is we might see public</text>
  <text start="118.55" dur="4.65">unrest in Puerto Rico because of all</text>
  <text start="121.88" dur="5.689">this because you know what happens when</text>
  <text start="123.2" dur="8.7">payments discontinued people get very</text>
  <text start="127.569" dur="6.041">very upset and they go right to the</text>
  <text start="131.9" dur="5.28">government and say what is going on here</text>
  <text start="133.61" dur="5.91">and we might see this and as more and</text>
  <text start="137.18" dur="5.1">more businesses closed down as more and</text>
  <text start="139.52" dur="6.51">more people struggle this is what</text>
  <text start="142.28" dur="6.929">happens when collapse hits and we will</text>
  <text start="146.03" dur="6.179">see this throughout United States once</text>
  <text start="149.209" dur="5.401">everything starts to fall apart it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="152.209" dur="4.441">going to be like Cyprus it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="154.61" dur="3.87">like Greece it&amp;#39;s going to be like Puerto</text>
  <text start="156.65" dur="3.93">Rico but it&amp;#39;s going to be much much</text>
  <text start="158.48" dur="5.78">worse because once it hits the United</text>
  <text start="160.58" dur="6.17">States everything just falls apart</text>
  <text start="164.26" dur="5.039">and the central bankers know this now</text>
  <text start="166.75" dur="5.79">the central bankers the Fed they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="169.299" dur="8.52">holding an expedited closed meeting on</text>
  <text start="172.54" dur="6.99">Monday now what is this meeting we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="177.819" dur="4.911">know there&amp;#39;s a couple things going on</text>
  <text start="179.53" dur="5.429">here we understand the statistical</text>
  <text start="182.73" dur="4">illusionary numbers that the government</text>
  <text start="184.959" dur="4.081">is continually putting out we know</text>
  <text start="186.73" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re fake we know this is not really</text>
  <text start="189.04" dur="2.91">how the economy is doing because we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="190.39" dur="3.09">been looking at all the real economic</text>
  <text start="191.95" dur="5.69">indicators right now the Baltic Dry</text>
  <text start="193.48" dur="8.129">Index basically it&amp;#39;s on a free</text>
  <text start="197.64" dur="7.54">free-for-all in a downward trend that is</text>
  <text start="201.609" dur="6.72">crashing and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="205.18" dur="5.49">is basically manufacturing heading down</text>
  <text start="208.329" dur="5.25">the same path retail heading down the</text>
  <text start="210.67" dur="6.569">same path housing right now the bubble</text>
  <text start="213.579" dur="5.49">is ready to pop and there are more and</text>
  <text start="217.239" dur="4.321">more layoffs coming down the road now we</text>
  <text start="219.069" dur="5.521">understand Congress has basically</text>
  <text start="221.56" dur="5.849">introduced legislation where they want</text>
  <text start="224.59" dur="5.149">to audit the Fed the Fed also realizes</text>
  <text start="227.409" dur="6.69">that the economy cannot be sustained and</text>
  <text start="229.739" dur="8.53">the question is what is going on right</text>
  <text start="234.099" dur="5.911">now in the Fed are they talking about</text>
  <text start="238.269" dur="4.44">interest rates or are they talking about</text>
  <text start="240.01" dur="5.43">something about maybe maybe we should</text>
  <text start="242.709" dur="4.911">bring down the economy and set up the</text>
  <text start="245.44" dur="6.06">time frame of when it will come down</text>
  <text start="247.62" dur="7.72">because we know as the economy falls</text>
  <text start="251.5" dur="7.59">apart and accelerates they want to be in</text>
  <text start="255.34" dur="5.07">control when they bring it down and this</text>
  <text start="259.09" dur="3.66">is why they&amp;#39;re getting prepared and</text>
  <text start="260.41" dur="6.539">ready to blame it on another group or</text>
  <text start="262.75" dur="5.88">another country now NSA Doc&amp;#39;s that were</text>
  <text start="266.949" dur="3.511">released from the Freedom of Information</text>
  <text start="268.63" dur="4.65">Act and this is reported in New York</text>
  <text start="270.46" dur="5.22">Times basically what they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="273.28" dur="4.56">that although the US government says an</text>
  <text start="275.68" dur="3.989">NSA program which collected email</text>
  <text start="277.84" dur="6.12">records of Americans was shut down in</text>
  <text start="279.669" dur="7.5">2011 guess what they really didn&amp;#39;t shut</text>
  <text start="283.96" dur="5.37">it down they kept on collecting and we</text>
  <text start="287.169" dur="4.281">know the government no matter what</text>
  <text start="289.33" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re telling us through lip service</text>
  <text start="291.45" dur="3.58">they&amp;#39;re actually doing the opposite in</text>
  <text start="293.71" dur="4.29">the background basically what they did</text>
  <text start="295.03" dur="7.74">is they use fiber optic internet</text>
  <text start="298" dur="8.34">ables outside the US to collect the</text>
  <text start="302.77" dur="6.48">domestic email data and they can say</text>
  <text start="306.34" dur="5.91">well we&amp;#39;re outside the US and this is</text>
  <text start="309.25" dur="5.82">how they&amp;#39;re spinning everything and they</text>
  <text start="312.25" dur="7.11">will never ever stop spying on the</text>
  <text start="315.07" dur="6.36">people you know a watchdog group says</text>
  <text start="319.36" dur="4.11">about eighty percent of the army</text>
  <text start="321.43" dur="4.74">contracts are complete duplicate of</text>
  <text start="323.47" dur="6.96">government services there&amp;#39;s so much</text>
  <text start="326.17" dur="6.57">waste right now it&amp;#39;s unbelievable they</text>
  <text start="330.43" dur="4.11">said contracts were for services already</text>
  <text start="332.74" dur="3.51">being provided by the government the</text>
  <text start="334.54" dur="3.69">Navy and other agencies reported about</text>
  <text start="336.25" dur="4.11">thirteen percent in contract services</text>
  <text start="338.23" dur="5.67">duplication and this is coming from the</text>
  <text start="340.36" dur="6.24">Government Accountability Office so we</text>
  <text start="343.9" dur="5.19">could see and we know right now is money</text>
  <text start="346.6" dur="3.99">is just being pushed all over the place</text>
  <text start="349.09" dur="3.24">of course it&amp;#39;s not going to the people</text>
  <text start="350.59" dur="4.41">it&amp;#39;s going to the government the</text>
  <text start="352.33" dur="4.74">industrial war complex we understand</text>
  <text start="355" dur="3.18">that many of the elite are collecting</text>
  <text start="357.07" dur="3.03">what they&amp;#39;re doing is everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="358.18" dur="3.78">scrambling for their piece before this</text>
  <text start="360.1" dur="4.17">whole entire system comes down because</text>
  <text start="361.96" dur="3.48">nobody wants to be holding paper so what</text>
  <text start="364.27" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re collecting the</text>
  <text start="365.44" dur="7.56">paper and buying real assets with it</text>
  <text start="368.02" dur="6.39">right now so they are covered out in</text>
  <text start="373" dur="4.5">Malley we understand there was a</text>
  <text start="374.41" dur="5.58">terrorist attack out in Malley and right</text>
  <text start="377.5" dur="3.78">now the United States has condemned of</text>
  <text start="379.99" dur="3.39">course the terrorist attack we just</text>
  <text start="381.28" dur="7.02">happen to have troops right there ready</text>
  <text start="383.38" dur="7.26">to go coincidence i think not and the</text>
  <text start="388.3" dur="4.679">United States is prepared to assist the</text>
  <text start="390.64" dur="5.52">Malian government in the coming days</text>
  <text start="392.979" dur="6.75">whatever they need and why are they in</text>
  <text start="396.16" dur="7.009">Malley well we understand that mally has</text>
  <text start="399.729" dur="7.741">the third-highest gold production in</text>
  <text start="403.169" dur="8.371">Africa and recently there was a new</text>
  <text start="407.47" dur="7.11">strain of gold discovered in Malley I</text>
  <text start="411.54" dur="7.689">wonder why they want to be in this area</text>
  <text start="414.58" dur="6.3">we know France is already here and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="419.229" dur="3.891">amazing that the United States is saying</text>
  <text start="420.88" dur="4.98">okay let&amp;#39;s get into this area also</text>
  <text start="423.12" dur="6.37">because they know they need more and</text>
  <text start="425.86" dur="5.07">more of this gold now the European</text>
  <text start="429.49" dur="2.41">governments they&amp;#39;re holding secret</text>
  <text start="430.93" dur="1.9">meetings</text>
  <text start="431.9" dur="2.79">and basically they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="432.83" dur="4.649">talking about dismantling the borderless</text>
  <text start="434.69" dur="4.5">travel the Schengen they&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="437.479" dur="3.241">dismantle it completely now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="439.19" dur="3.72">happening in these meetings we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="440.72" dur="3.9">know exactly what&amp;#39;s going to be but what</text>
  <text start="442.91" dur="6.42">they are saying is the current system is</text>
  <text start="444.62" dur="8.13">simply not working and it looks like</text>
  <text start="449.33" dur="6.929">they will be setting up geographical</text>
  <text start="452.75" dur="5.729">blocks and it looks like many of these</text>
  <text start="456.259" dur="4.38">refugees which most of them are not</text>
  <text start="458.479" dur="5.28">Syrian will not be allowed into these</text>
  <text start="460.639" dur="7.621">countries and this is all part of the</text>
  <text start="463.759" dur="7.081">plan to create as much chaos and to put</text>
  <text start="468.26" dur="6.36">the European nations against each other</text>
  <text start="470.84" dur="7.049">and try to convince them they should all</text>
  <text start="474.62" dur="5.79">get together and go into Syria and this</text>
  <text start="477.889" dur="4.59">is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now that this</text>
  <text start="480.41" dur="5.7">might be the trigger point of where</text>
  <text start="482.479" dur="5.581">everything is going to occur in Syria</text>
  <text start="486.11" dur="4.44">they want all the European nations</text>
  <text start="488.06" dur="6.539">involved they want China they want</text>
  <text start="490.55" dur="6.33">Russia the United States and we see</text>
  <text start="494.599" dur="5.011">everything is being concentrated in in</text>
  <text start="496.88" dur="5.34">this one area right now now there is a</text>
  <text start="499.61" dur="5.61">US Congresswoman who introduced a bill</text>
  <text start="502.22" dur="6.33">to stop the illegal war on Assad this is</text>
  <text start="505.22" dur="6.36">us congresswoman tulsi gabbard and she</text>
  <text start="508.55" dur="6.479">calls on Washington and their effort to</text>
  <text start="511.58" dur="5.31">oust Assad counterproductive and illegal</text>
  <text start="515.029" dur="5.07">before taking it a step further and</text>
  <text start="516.89" dur="5.22">accusing the CIA of arming the very same</text>
  <text start="520.099" dur="4.411">terrorists who the White House insists</text>
  <text start="522.11" dur="4.65">are sworn enemies now she better watch</text>
  <text start="524.51" dur="4.14">her back at this point because she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="526.76" dur="6">calling them out now everything she says</text>
  <text start="528.65" dur="6.66">isn&amp;#39;t exactly right but she&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="532.76" dur="4.26">close and this is most likely making a</text>
  <text start="535.31" dur="3.21">lot of the government employees very</text>
  <text start="537.02" dur="3.54">very nervous that she&amp;#39;s coming out and</text>
  <text start="538.52" dur="4.95">saying this and she introduced this</text>
  <text start="540.56" dur="5.94">legislation to end the illegal war and</text>
  <text start="543.47" dur="5.58">the u.s. is she says the u.s. is waging</text>
  <text start="546.5" dur="5.07">two different wars one against the</text>
  <text start="549.05" dur="5.46">Islamic state which is part of the CIA</text>
  <text start="551.57" dur="4.8">which the US is backing so it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="554.51" dur="3.949">not a war and the other one is against</text>
  <text start="556.37" dur="6.48">Assad and the one against Assad is</text>
  <text start="558.459" dur="6.101">completely illegal and it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="562.85" dur="2.55">illegal to overthrow the Syrian</text>
  <text start="564.56" dur="4.86">government</text>
  <text start="565.4" dur="5.52">and she wants this stopped now every</text>
  <text start="569.42" dur="4.8">single American should be standing up</text>
  <text start="570.92" dur="6.66">going why are we even in Syria in the</text>
  <text start="574.22" dur="7.23">first place why did we invade a</text>
  <text start="577.58" dur="5.94">sovereign country and if we truly truly</text>
  <text start="581.45" dur="3.81">going after terrorism in that country</text>
  <text start="583.52" dur="4.23">why aren&amp;#39;t we working with the</text>
  <text start="585.26" dur="5.58">government why is the government more</text>
  <text start="587.75" dur="6.21">interested in removing Assad they going</text>
  <text start="590.84" dur="5.58">after the Islamic state and we know the</text>
  <text start="593.96" dur="4.8">answer to that because their whole goal</text>
  <text start="596.42" dur="4.95">was always to get Assad the Islamic</text>
  <text start="598.76" dur="3.54">state is the proxy army of the United</text>
  <text start="601.37" dur="4.5">States government and the coalition</text>
  <text start="602.3" dur="7.62">forces and they created them they funded</text>
  <text start="605.87" dur="6.36">them and right now Russia is destroying</text>
  <text start="609.92" dur="4.05">them and because Russia is destroying</text>
  <text start="612.23" dur="4.77">them the United States the coalition</text>
  <text start="613.97" dur="5.4">forces are backed into a corner pretty</text>
  <text start="617" dur="4.44">soon there will be no more terrorism in</text>
  <text start="619.37" dur="5.1">Syria the way Russia and Syria are going</text>
  <text start="621.44" dur="5.97">and the u.s. knows this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="624.47" dur="5.04">running out of time so we&amp;#39;re seeing all</text>
  <text start="627.41" dur="4.29">of these threats now Belgium right now</text>
  <text start="629.51" dur="6.06">they&amp;#39;re saying there&amp;#39;s a terror threat</text>
  <text start="631.7" dur="6.51">in Brussels everyone is being warned to</text>
  <text start="635.57" dur="7.01">avoid crowded areas i mean the fear</text>
  <text start="638.21" dur="6.93">factor is like way above 10 right now</text>
  <text start="642.58" dur="5.92">they are just making everyone believe</text>
  <text start="645.14" dur="6.38">you should be afraid all the time and</text>
  <text start="648.5" dur="5.73">this is part of the false flag event</text>
  <text start="651.52" dur="4.72">they want to take away the rights they</text>
  <text start="654.23" dur="4.14">want to make people scared they want to</text>
  <text start="656.24" dur="5.97">make people pointing fingers at each</text>
  <text start="658.37" dur="8.31">other and basically Belgium looks like a</text>
  <text start="662.21" dur="7.35">war zone and they have basically</text>
  <text start="666.68" dur="5.4">military soldiers barricades all over</text>
  <text start="669.56" dur="5.34">the place Belgium&amp;#39;s capital is on</text>
  <text start="672.08" dur="5.64">security lockdown the US Embassy in</text>
  <text start="674.9" dur="9.48">Brussels is calling on Americans to stay</text>
  <text start="677.72" dur="8.85">indoors and will something happen we</text>
  <text start="684.38" dur="3.87">will have to wait and see but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="686.57" dur="4.08">looking at this very very carefully</text>
  <text start="688.25" dur="5.61">because of the threats now Anonymous has</text>
  <text start="690.65" dur="6.09">come out and they&amp;#39;ve published a list of</text>
  <text start="693.86" dur="3.78">the Islamic state targets for Sunday</text>
  <text start="696.74" dur="3.66">attacks</text>

  <text start="718.61" dur="6.45">attack this Sunday now of course the FBI</text>
  <text start="721.97" dur="4.32">DHS and all the other agencies have no</text>
  <text start="725.06" dur="3.48">information about this whatsoever</text>
  <text start="726.29" dur="7.05">because as we know most of these events</text>
  <text start="728.54" dur="7.71">are ginned up by them so they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="733.34" dur="6.42">into this and they&amp;#39;re going to believe</text>
  <text start="736.25" dur="6.08">anonymous now they actually got this</text>
  <text start="739.76" dur="5.52">information to me it&amp;#39;s kind of sketchy</text>

  <text start="745.28" dur="5.34">official story continually tells us that</text>
  <text start="747.59" dur="5.7">it&amp;#39;s getting more and more difficult for</text>
  <text start="750.62" dur="6.06">them to find the terrorists because of</text>
  <text start="753.29" dur="6.48">encryption but Anonymous has the ability</text>
  <text start="756.68" dur="5.82">to find a list of all the terrorist</text>
  <text start="759.77" dur="6.18">attacks I mean something just doesn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="769.85" dur="5.34">of the Islamic state now will something</text>
  <text start="771.65" dur="6.57">happen on sunday we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and</text>
  <text start="775.19" dur="5.13">see but the FBI and all the other</text>

  <text start="790.22" dur="4.74">this point and I think they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="791.99" dur="4.98">throwing out all this information but</text>
  <text start="794.96" dur="3.93">again we will have to wait and see and</text>
  <text start="796.97" dur="4.02">we&amp;#39;ll have to see what occurs this</text>
  <text start="798.89" dur="3.87">sunday at this point i think what</text>
  <text start="800.99" dur="3.77">they&amp;#39;re really doing is keeping the fear</text>
  <text start="802.76" dur="5.01">factor as high as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="804.76" dur="6.64">keeping it around the world until they</text>
