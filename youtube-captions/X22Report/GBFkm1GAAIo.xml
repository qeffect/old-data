  <text start="144.89" dur="4.44">stock market has nothing to do with the</text>
  <text start="147.11" dur="4.59">economy but remember the deep state the</text>
  <text start="149.33" dur="6.409">central bank they created this</text>

  <text start="167.92" dur="6.039">doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you see these things</text>
  <text start="170.75" dur="5.31">that means the entire system is doing</text>
  <text start="173.959" dur="5.961">well and like I said many many times</text>
  <text start="176.06" dur="9.66">before Trump is using all their weapons</text>
  <text start="179.92" dur="6.929">against them he has the central bank</text>
  <text start="185.72" dur="5.519">where he wants him</text>
  <text start="186.849" dur="6.491">remember Trump his entire policy is</text>
  <text start="191.239" dur="5.131">America first let&amp;#39;s make America great</text>
  <text start="193.34" dur="5.819">again how do you do that well you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="196.37" dur="5.91">do it with a central bank system you</text>
  <text start="199.159" dur="6.53">can&amp;#39;t do it with certain individuals in</text>
  <text start="202.28" dur="8.19">power you can&amp;#39;t do it with government</text>
  <text start="205.689" dur="7">swamp by the swamp it&amp;#39;s impossible you</text>
  <text start="210.47" dur="5.519">need to remove all this now remember in</text>
  <text start="212.689" dur="6.601">the past 35 years the Wall Street</text>
  <text start="215.989" dur="5.761">multinationals gained as cheap money</text>
  <text start="219.29" dur="4.729">flowed overseas to start global</text>
  <text start="221.75" dur="6.569">manufacturing operations Main Street USA</text>
  <text start="224.019" dur="6.58">suffered for it when you reverse this</text>
  <text start="228.319" dur="5.34">process by punishing the multinationals</text>
  <text start="230.599" dur="5.431">using tariffs shifting the global supply</text>
  <text start="233.659" dur="4.741">chain and changing the best location for</text>
  <text start="236.03" dur="6.889">investment dollars Main Street USA</text>
  <text start="238.4" dur="9.6">benefits this is what Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="242.919" dur="7.81">Trump has changed everything remember</text>
  <text start="248" dur="6.389">he&amp;#39;s making America great again</text>
  <text start="250.729" dur="7.26">which means bringing back businesses</text>
  <text start="254.389" dur="6.871">bringing back manufacturing removing</text>
  <text start="257.989" dur="6.061">this horrible central bank system that</text>
  <text start="261.26" dur="4.86">does not benefit the people do you think</text>
  <text start="264.05" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s just a coincidence that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="266.12" dur="3.39">contradicting and hitting the Fed as</text>
  <text start="268.34" dur="4.139">hard as possible</text>
  <text start="269.51" dur="4.83">remember months ago when people were out</text>
  <text start="272.479" dur="4.47">there saying oh look he just started to</text>
  <text start="274.34" dur="4.919">contradict the Fed and we said as we get</text>
  <text start="276.949" dur="5.371">closer to the end of this year he was</text>
  <text start="279.259" dur="5.761">just gonna unleash and go after the Fed</text>
  <text start="282.32" dur="7.08">what is he doing right now he&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="285.02" dur="9.24">doing what we said he was going to do he</text>
  <text start="289.4" dur="8.19">is moving the entire arsenal</text>
  <text start="294.26" dur="6.84">of weaponry and pointing it towards the</text>
  <text start="297.59" dur="6.72">Fed and he&amp;#39;s going to continue to do</text>
  <text start="301.1" dur="5.82">this he wants to wake America up he</text>
  <text start="304.31" dur="4.53">wants to wake the world up to what is</text>
  <text start="306.92" dur="5.34">going on here remember what he tweeted</text>
  <text start="308.84" dur="7.11">out yesterday three more central banks</text>
  <text start="312.26" dur="5.19">cut rates our problem is not China we</text>
  <text start="315.95" dur="3.69">are stronger than ever money is pouring</text>
  <text start="317.45" dur="4.47">into the US while China is losing</text>
  <text start="319.64" dur="4.62">companies by the thousands to other</text>
  <text start="321.92" dur="4.68">countries and their currency is under</text>
  <text start="324.26" dur="5.88">siege our problem is the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="326.6" dur="5.31">that is too proud to admit their mistake</text>
  <text start="330.14" dur="5.82">of acting too fast and tightening too</text>
  <text start="331.91" dur="6.42">much and that I was right they must cut</text>
  <text start="335.96" dur="4.11">rates bigger and faster and stop their</text>
  <text start="338.33" dur="4.47">ridiculous quantitative tightening now</text>
  <text start="340.07" dur="5.97">yield curve is at too wide a margin and</text>
  <text start="342.8" dur="4.53">no inflation incompetence is a terrible</text>
  <text start="346.04" dur="3.9">thing to watch especially when things</text>
  <text start="347.33" dur="4.92">could be taken care of so easily we will</text>
  <text start="349.94" dur="5.43">win anyway but would be much easier if</text>
  <text start="352.25" dur="6.81">the Fed understood which they don&amp;#39;t that</text>
  <text start="355.37" dur="7.17">we are competing against other countries</text>
  <text start="359.06" dur="6.78">all of whom want to do well at our</text>
  <text start="362.54" dur="6.18">expense we&amp;#39;re competing against other</text>
  <text start="365.84" dur="5.64">countries were competing with all those</text>
  <text start="368.72" dur="5.99">companies that were moved out of the</text>
  <text start="371.48" dur="5.79">United States into these other countries</text>
  <text start="374.71" dur="5.71">he wants to bring them back he wants</text>
  <text start="377.27" dur="6.63">them out of the other countries because</text>
  <text start="380.42" dur="5.85">the globalist the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="383.9" dur="6.63">move these countries these companies out</text>
  <text start="386.27" dur="9.09">of the United States and he&amp;#39;s doing this</text>
  <text start="390.53" dur="8.13">because he understands that this system</text>
  <text start="395.36" dur="6.93">the central bank system can no longer</text>
  <text start="398.66" dur="5.76">function it&amp;#39;s dead in the water it has</text>
  <text start="402.29" dur="5.55">been for a very long time of course they</text>
  <text start="404.42" dur="6.42">had completely different plans but Trump</text>
  <text start="407.84" dur="7.53">is not following that path he&amp;#39;s changed</text>
  <text start="410.84" dur="8.96">a path and now the world is following</text>
  <text start="415.37" dur="8.69">him or I mean by this</text>
  <text start="419.8" dur="9.109">I mean think about what he said in his</text>
  <text start="424.06" dur="8.31">tweet three more central banks cut rates</text>
  <text start="428.909" dur="7.44">which means other central banks are</text>
  <text start="432.37" dur="7.62">doing exactly what he wants them to do</text>
  <text start="436.349" dur="6.85">they&amp;#39;re all cutting rates and many more</text>
  <text start="439.99" dur="5.57">will follow what happens when that</text>
  <text start="443.199" dur="5.521">happens when there is no interest</text>
  <text start="445.56" dur="6.46">remember the central bank system</text>
  <text start="448.72" dur="6.689">operates on putting countries into debt</text>
  <text start="452.02" dur="3.929">where it&amp;#39;s completely impossible to pay</text>
  <text start="455.409" dur="4.081">back</text>
  <text start="455.949" dur="6.271">they love their interest attached to the</text>
  <text start="459.49" dur="4.14">currency they loan governments because</text>
  <text start="462.22" dur="3.36">think about it let&amp;#39;s go back to the</text>
  <text start="463.63" dur="4.74">beginning when the central bank is first</text>
  <text start="465.58" dur="4.92">set up and they&amp;#39;ll own that first dollar</text>
  <text start="468.37" dur="3.87">to the government there&amp;#39;s interest</text>
  <text start="470.5" dur="6.9">attached on remember that&amp;#39;s the only</text>
  <text start="472.24" dur="7.47">dollar that exists in the world now the</text>
  <text start="477.4" dur="5.669">government has it the central bank says</text>
  <text start="479.71" dur="6.03">hey you owe us a dollar five a dollar</text>
  <text start="483.069" dur="4.201">ten whatever the interest rate is where</text>
  <text start="485.74" dur="5.22">does the government get the five cents</text>
  <text start="487.27" dur="7.649">or the ten cents well it doesn&amp;#39;t exist</text>
  <text start="490.96" dur="6.63">does it they have to borrow more to pay</text>
  <text start="494.919" dur="7.021">that back and this is what the central</text>
  <text start="497.59" dur="9.479">bank does it hurts countries it hurts</text>
  <text start="501.94" dur="10.8">the people it does not benefit anybody</text>
  <text start="507.069" dur="9.53">except the central bank now Trump he</text>
  <text start="512.74" dur="8.039">understands this and he&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="516.599" dur="7.24">pushing and prodding the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="520.779" dur="5.641">and while he&amp;#39;s doing this he&amp;#39;s letting</text>
  <text start="523.839" dur="5.851">the people know he tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="526.42" dur="5.4">following as your president one would</text>
  <text start="529.69" dur="4.47">think I would be thrilled with our very</text>

  <text start="606.54" dur="7.48">what countries have they made incredibly</text>
  <text start="609.85" dur="6.93">rich and prosperous none most of the</text>
  <text start="614.02" dur="6.09">countries are in debt most of the</text>
  <text start="616.78" dur="5.55">countries are struggling and this is</text>
  <text start="620.11" dur="4.98">because of the central bank system but</text>
  <text start="622.33" dur="4.8">look at Russia for instance they got rid</text>

  <text start="640.57" dur="6.84">Russian government and they have</text>
  <text start="643.68" dur="6.37">virtually no debt whatsoever which means</text>
  <text start="647.41" dur="8.55">the central bank has no leverage over</text>
  <text start="650.05" dur="9.99">the people and Trump right now wants the</text>

  <text start="672.22" dur="6.57">the US or the world for that matter but</text>
  <text start="676.06" dur="7.2">when we look around you can see that the</text>
