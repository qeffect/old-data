  <text start="161.82" dur="3.09">in the US economy now we see two things</text>
  <text start="164.13" dur="2.85">happening</text>
  <text start="164.91" dur="4.95">the first thing we see happening is that</text>
  <text start="166.98" dur="5.13">the central bank illusion is starting to</text>
  <text start="169.86" dur="5.67">break apart fall apart and Trump is</text>
  <text start="172.11" dur="5.78">doing everything he possibly can to hold</text>
  <text start="175.53" dur="5.07">it off for a certain period of time</text>

  <text start="180.6" dur="7.17">to bring back manufacturing bring back</text>
  <text start="183.6" dur="8.07">jobs create trade deals now the first</text>
  <text start="187.77" dur="5.76">part we see housing retail everything</text>
  <text start="191.67" dur="5.67">else that has to do with people it is</text>
  <text start="193.53" dur="5.97">completely breaking down and we can see</text>
  <text start="197.34" dur="2.67">with the housing market the housing</text>
  <text start="199.5" dur="3.99">market</text>
  <text start="200.01" dur="5.7">well those bubbles they are deflating</text>
  <text start="203.49" dur="4.41">and soon they&amp;#39;re going to just pop and</text>
  <text start="205.71" dur="3.78">all the air is gonna come out of it now</text>
  <text start="207.9" dur="3.12">we&amp;#39;re not just seeing this happen here</text>
  <text start="209.49" dur="3.33">in the United States we&amp;#39;re seeing it</text>
  <text start="211.02" dur="3.15">happen around the world we&amp;#39;re seeing in</text>
  <text start="212.82" dur="3.6">Canada we&amp;#39;re seeing in Australia we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="214.17" dur="5.1">seeing it in Europe here in the United</text>
  <text start="216.42" dur="5.49">States we see that home price growth</text>
  <text start="219.27" dur="7.83">well they are the weakest since January</text>
  <text start="221.91" dur="8.4">of 2015 now they expected a 5.0 2%</text>
  <text start="227.1" dur="6.33">October print but it came in around four</text>
  <text start="230.31" dur="5.16">point eight nine percent and in November</text>
  <text start="233.43" dur="4.98">it came in at four point six eight</text>
  <text start="235.47" dur="5.22">percent as you can see it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="238.41" dur="4.98">well and we see there are some places</text>
  <text start="240.69" dur="4.74">where housing prices they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="243.39" dur="4.44">moving up but very slowly and we see</text>
  <text start="245.43" dur="6.03">other places where housing prices</text>
  <text start="247.83" dur="7.26">they&amp;#39;re starting to drop now we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="251.46" dur="6.66">going to see the entire country come</text>
  <text start="255.09" dur="4.74">down all at the same time this didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="258.12" dur="3.72">happen in 2008 didn&amp;#39;t happen in the</text>
  <text start="259.83" dur="4.68">Great Depression you see it happen in</text>
  <text start="261.84" dur="4.95">many different areas and then it spreads</text>
  <text start="264.51" dur="4.79">and then it hits every single area and</text>
  <text start="266.79" dur="4.65">that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing here</text>
  <text start="269.3" dur="3.76">certain areas and especially out of the</text>
  <text start="271.44" dur="2.61">20 cities that Case Shiller looks at</text>
  <text start="273.06" dur="3.27">because those are the cities that the</text>
  <text start="274.05" dur="5.34">central bank used to prop this whole</text>
  <text start="276.33" dur="4.86">thing up if you look outside of that you</text>
  <text start="279.39" dur="4.53">can see that there are many many places</text>
  <text start="281.19" dur="5.49">where prices are starting to fall now</text>
  <text start="283.92" dur="6.36">the prices are still high and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="286.68" dur="7.17">seeing is that every day Americans who</text>
  <text start="290.28" dur="6.96">are earning their yearly salary they</text>
  <text start="293.85" dur="4.83">cannot afford these types of homes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="297.24" dur="4.92">completely impossible</text>
  <text start="298.68" dur="5.7">and something has to change and that</text>
  <text start="302.16" dur="4.62">change is going to be a brand new</text>
  <text start="304.38" dur="2.759">economic system now is it gonna happen</text>
  <text start="306.78" dur="3.33">tomorrow</text>
  <text start="307.139" dur="6.391">no Trump the Patriots they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="310.11" dur="7.649">planning for this now Trump he just</text>
  <text start="313.53" dur="6.24">secured another major trade victory the</text>
  <text start="317.759" dur="4.351">European Commission approved US soybeans</text>
  <text start="319.77" dur="5.64">to be used in the production of biofuels</text>
  <text start="322.11" dur="5.7">a decision that will fulfill president</text>
  <text start="325.41" dur="6.03">Trump&amp;#39;s demand that European Union buy</text>
  <text start="327.81" dur="6.24">more of the product so today&amp;#39;s decision</text>
  <text start="331.44" dur="6.18">is new proof that the European Union is</text>
  <text start="334.05" dur="5.85">delivering on our commitments and it</text>
  <text start="337.62" dur="5.4">looks like Trump is getting his way</text>
  <text start="339.9" dur="6.93">remember he also made a deal with China</text>
  <text start="343.02" dur="5.79">to accept the soy beans so the EU right</text>
  <text start="346.83" dur="4.5">now currently imports around 14 million</text>
  <text start="348.81" dur="5.07">tons of soybeans annually for animal</text>
  <text start="351.33" dur="3.6">feed the US already holds a commanding</text>
  <text start="353.88" dur="3.18">share of the market</text>
  <text start="354.93" dur="4.049">however the Commission&amp;#39;s decision to</text>
  <text start="357.06" dur="4.59">allow us soybeans to be used in the</text>
  <text start="358.979" dur="4.381">making of biofuels in agricultural based</text>
  <text start="361.65" dur="4.019">energy alternative to fossil fuels is</text>
  <text start="363.36" dur="7.71">expected to dramatically increase demand</text>
  <text start="365.669" dur="8.671">in Europe so once again Trump is making</text>
  <text start="371.07" dur="8.54">these deals to better the United States</text>
  <text start="374.34" dur="7.77">moving forward and why is he doing this</text>
  <text start="379.61" dur="6.899">well we understand why he&amp;#39;s doing this</text>
  <text start="382.11" dur="8.19">because we are headed towards a major</text>
  <text start="386.509" dur="6.851">transition in the economy now Alistair</text>
  <text start="390.3" dur="6.869">McLeod he put together ten factors to</text>
  <text start="393.36" dur="5.429">look for in gold in 2019 and when I was</text>
  <text start="397.169" dur="4.801">reading this and looking at this I</text>
  <text start="398.789" dur="6.63">started to think to myself it seems like</text>
  <text start="401.97" dur="5.879">Trump is using the deep state the</text>
  <text start="405.419" dur="4.62">central bank&amp;#39;s plan their economic plan</text>
  <text start="407.849" dur="3.721">against them now we need to back up a</text>
  <text start="410.039" dur="5.011">little bit so you can understand what</text>
  <text start="411.57" dur="7.05">I&amp;#39;m talking about here when Obama was</text>
  <text start="415.05" dur="6.119">president the plan back then and if</text>
  <text start="418.62" dur="6.359">Clinton was in office the plan back then</text>
  <text start="421.169" dur="7.141">was to move the entire central bank</text>
  <text start="424.979" dur="5.55">system from the United States to another</text>
  <text start="428.31" dur="4.26">country now does that mean that country</text>
  <text start="430.529" dur="3.361">was going to be the reserve currency No</text>
  <text start="432.57" dur="4.23">I do believe that we&amp;#39;re gonna try to</text>
  <text start="433.89" dur="5.25">make the SDR maybe the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="436.8" dur="3.84">maybe the you want maybe in combination</text>
  <text start="439.14" dur="3.9">working together</text>
  <text start="440.64" dur="5.13">we don&amp;#39;t really know they were gonna use</text>
  <text start="443.04" dur="6.17">some type of paper currency that they</text>
  <text start="445.77" dur="6.42">can control but we can see over time</text>
  <text start="449.21" dur="6.55">what the deep state what the central</text>
  <text start="452.19" dur="6.03">bankers were doing we knew they were</text>
  <text start="455.76" dur="4.98">moving all manufacturing many businesses</text>
  <text start="458.22" dur="4.64">out of the United States we knew with</text>
  <text start="460.74" dur="4.77">the trans-pacific partnership they were</text>
  <text start="462.86" dur="5.29">bringing the level of the United States</text>
  <text start="465.51" dur="7.17">down to the level of all the third-world</text>
  <text start="468.15" dur="7.62">countries China was receiving all the</text>
  <text start="472.68" dur="4.83">manufacturing businesses Asia was</text>
  <text start="475.77" dur="4.95">receiving a lot of the businesses</text>
  <text start="477.51" dur="7.35">everything was being moved from one area</text>
  <text start="480.72" dur="6.47">to another and the deep state what they</text>
  <text start="484.86" dur="4.29">were doing is they were pushing</text>
  <text start="487.19" dur="3.43">sanctions on many countries now</text>
  <text start="489.15" dur="3.39">countries too started to wake up and</text>
  <text start="490.62" dur="3.24">said you know something we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="492.54" dur="3.42">get out of the dollar we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="493.86" dur="5.19">use the dollar and this way the deep</text>
  <text start="495.96" dur="5.97">state won&amp;#39;t have control over us now</text>
  <text start="499.05" dur="5.58">think about what they were doing they</text>
  <text start="501.93" dur="4.53">were moving away not from the US dollar</text>
  <text start="504.63" dur="6.63">but they were moving away from the</text>
  <text start="506.46" dur="7.2">central bank dollar certain nations were</text>
  <text start="511.26" dur="4.589">doing this today we can see there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="513.66" dur="5.069">quite a bit of nations that are doing</text>
  <text start="515.849" dur="6.361">this we see that China Russia India and</text>
  <text start="518.729" dur="6.711">Iran they are turning their backs on the</text>
  <text start="522.21" dur="5.64">dollar for trade settlement and remember</text>
  <text start="525.44" dur="5.26">forget about thinking about the dollar</text>
  <text start="527.85" dur="5.19">as the people&amp;#39;s dollar this is a Federal</text>
  <text start="530.7" dur="4.26">Reserve Note it is a debt note so</text>
  <text start="533.04" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re turning their back on the</text>
  <text start="534.96" dur="4.65">central bank no we moving forward we</text>
  <text start="537.24" dur="5.73">don&amp;#39;t want a central bank note this is</text>
  <text start="539.61" dur="5.19">not good for the people so back when</text>
  <text start="542.97" dur="3.48">Obama was president president they were</text>
  <text start="544.8" dur="5.34">hoping that Clinton was going to fill</text>
  <text start="546.45" dur="5.76">the presidency after Obama and we were</text>
  <text start="550.14" dur="3.48">going to have an event now there were</text>
  <text start="552.21" dur="3.03">certain countries that knew that this</text>
  <text start="553.62" dur="4.22">was happening they knew they were</text>
  <text start="555.24" dur="6.24">getting prepared for the next system and</text>
  <text start="557.84" dur="6.56">we see that China was a big part of this</text>
  <text start="561.48" dur="5.38">and we know that the central bank&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="564.4" dur="4.98">were planning on China of they were</text>
  <text start="566.86" dur="4.98">going to be the next powerhouse this is</text>
  <text start="569.38" dur="5.73">why Clinton was selling secrets this is</text>
  <text start="571.84" dur="5.25">why we see all the technology moving to</text>
  <text start="575.11" dur="4.71">China this is why they&amp;#39;re in trouble</text>
  <text start="577.09" dur="5.13">today because the deep state was</text>
  <text start="579.82" dur="4.95">involved in all this the central bankers</text>
  <text start="582.22" dur="6.42">were involved in all this preparing</text>
  <text start="584.77" dur="5.64">China to be the next powerhouse and the</text>
  <text start="588.64" dur="4.05">power was going to be taken away from</text>
  <text start="590.41" dur="4.62">the United States and of course we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="592.69" dur="3.48">gonna enter a war and then you know</text>
  <text start="595.03" dur="2.96">through the war they were gonna say</text>
  <text start="596.17" dur="4.59">everyone had a sacrifice after the war</text>
  <text start="597.99" dur="5.35">they were gonna say okay the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="600.76" dur="4.59">completely damaged remember China had</text>
  <text start="603.34" dur="3.48">the ability to bring down our jets China</text>
  <text start="605.35" dur="3.42">had the ability and they knew our</text>
  <text start="606.82" dur="3.81">secrets so eventually what they were</text>
  <text start="608.77" dur="4.14">gonna try to do is make America lose the</text>
  <text start="610.63" dur="3.42">war and this way they can get rid of the</text>
  <text start="612.91" dur="2.67">Constitution they can get rid of</text>
  <text start="614.05" dur="4.2">everything you really think about it and</text>
  <text start="615.58" dur="4.5">that in those terms but right now</text>
  <text start="618.25" dur="4.68">everything has changed now everything</text>
  <text start="620.08" dur="4.95">was in motion to have China as the</text>
  <text start="622.93" dur="5.21">powerhouse now what is Trump been doing</text>
  <text start="625.03" dur="5.64">well he&amp;#39;s been setting up trade ales</text>
  <text start="628.14" dur="5.8">introducing tariffs against China</text>
  <text start="630.67" dur="6.15">calling China out having them look into</text>
  <text start="633.94" dur="5.88">what they&amp;#39;ve stolen technology-wise</text>
  <text start="636.82" dur="6.06">remember each country has the deep state</text>
  <text start="639.82" dur="5.22">within the country and we can see that</text>
  <text start="642.88" dur="6.48">Xi Jinping and Trump they actually get</text>
  <text start="645.04" dur="6.48">along and they are working on a trade</text>
  <text start="649.36" dur="5.97">deal remember everything was weighted</text>
  <text start="651.52" dur="6.57">towards China now Trump is trying to</text>
  <text start="655.33" dur="5.22">reset all of this and bring it back to</text>
  <text start="658.09" dur="5.75">the United States but what we see</text>
  <text start="660.55" dur="5.73">happening here is that Russia and China</text>
  <text start="663.84" dur="4.87">they have accumulated a lot of gold</text>
  <text start="666.28" dur="4.23">during this period because the central</text>
  <text start="668.71" dur="3.24">bankers were going to use the gold as a</text>
  <text start="670.51" dur="5.31">confidence builder just like they did</text>
  <text start="671.95" dur="6.6">back in 1940 when we took the reserve</text>
  <text start="675.82" dur="3.81">currency away from England and we</text>
  <text start="678.55" dur="3.6">brought it over here to the United</text>
  <text start="679.63" dur="4.29">States and gold was the confidence</text>
  <text start="682.15" dur="4.89">builder but it was still a central bank</text>
  <text start="683.92" dur="3.45">system the same thing is happening right</text>
  <text start="687.04" dur="2.82">now</text>

  <text start="689.86" dur="5.73">their dollar reserves and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="692.5" dur="5.06">purchasing gold now can they do this all</text>
  <text start="695.59" dur="4.49">at once no because it would crushed in</text>
  <text start="697.56" dur="4.92">our system but we see that Russia and</text>
  <text start="700.08" dur="4.26">China they&amp;#39;ve been dumping their dollar</text>
  <text start="702.48" dur="5.25">reserves and they&amp;#39;ve been purchasing</text>
  <text start="704.34" dur="6.36">gold Russia and particularly China a</text>
  <text start="707.73" dur="4.71">little bit harder to do they can&amp;#39;t dump</text>
  <text start="710.7" dur="4.139">everything all at once because it would</text>
  <text start="712.44" dur="5.01">completely crash the system but we see</text>
  <text start="714.839" dur="5.19">other cent we see other European</text>
  <text start="717.45" dur="5.19">countries like Hungary Poland they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="720.029" dur="4.341">accumulating gold reserves we see a lot</text>
  <text start="722.64" dur="5.19">of countries we pay trading their gold</text>
  <text start="724.37" dur="4.96">now if you&amp;#39;re going to destroy a central</text>
  <text start="727.83" dur="3.9">bank system and remember you just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="729.33" dur="6.9">destroy the Federal Reserve you need to</text>
  <text start="731.73" dur="6.54">destroy the entire system remember Q has</text>
  <text start="736.23" dur="5.37">told us that gold will destroyed the</text>

  <text start="744.36" dur="5.97">central banks remember in the beginning</text>
  <text start="746.99" dur="6.01">q gave us many different posts that had</text>
  <text start="750.33" dur="5.13">all the different countries with all the</text>
  <text start="753" dur="7.339">rostral central banks in these countries</text>
  <text start="755.46" dur="9.57">if Trump uses the central bank plan and</text>
  <text start="760.339" dur="7.801">as all these countries start to remove</text>
  <text start="765.03" dur="7.11">their dollars to take on gold and</text>
  <text start="768.14" dur="6.61">continually do this over time while</text>
  <text start="772.14" dur="5.31">Trump prepares this country for a</text>
  <text start="774.75" dur="6.57">transition because eventually we have to</text>
  <text start="777.45" dur="6.389">come out and move away from the Federal</text>
  <text start="781.32" dur="7.92">Reserve Note we need to move into a</text>

  <text start="789.24" dur="8.12">interest attached now to get the world</text>
  <text start="792.36" dur="9.39">to do this what approach would you take</text>
  <text start="797.36" dur="8.77">would you continue with the plan of the</text>
  <text start="801.75" dur="7.709">central bankers up to a point you would</text>
  <text start="806.13" dur="7.29">continue pushing these countries so they</text>
  <text start="809.459" dur="8.191">would move away from the dollar move</text>
  <text start="813.42" dur="9.63">away from the central bank debt note</text>
  <text start="817.65" dur="7.11">take on more gold at a certain point you</text>
  <text start="823.05" dur="4.65">wouldn&amp;#39;t follow the central bank plan</text>
  <text start="824.76" dur="5.87">anymore you know go to war and then</text>
  <text start="827.7" dur="6.24">restart their system as a certain point</text>
  <text start="830.63" dur="5.47">the Patriot plan comes into play the</text>
  <text start="833.94" dur="5.46">Patriot plan in coordination with Russia</text>
  <text start="836.1" dur="4.34">and China and many other countries would</text>
  <text start="839.4" dur="5.07">band together</text>
  <text start="840.44" dur="8.86">use their gold to create a confidence</text>
  <text start="844.47" dur="9.48">builder and destroy the central bank</text>
  <text start="849.3" dur="7.56">system because once every country moves</text>
  <text start="853.95" dur="6.84">away from the central bank notes and</text>
  <text start="856.86" dur="6.45">uses their own national currencies now</text>
  <text start="860.79" dur="5.9">going back a year or two Russia has been</text>
  <text start="863.31" dur="6.62">called All Nations to use their own</text>
  <text start="866.69" dur="7.27">currencies in trade</text>
  <text start="869.93" dur="7.3">now if countries start to do this and</text>
  <text start="873.96" dur="7.23">they use gold to maintain their wealth</text>
  <text start="877.23" dur="6.42">they use their national currencies what</text>
  <text start="881.19" dur="5.3">happened to the central banks what</text>
  <text start="883.65" dur="7.439">happens to the central bank&amp;#39;s system</text>
  <text start="886.49" dur="7.59">well they could use gold to make sure</text>
  <text start="891.089" dur="5.821">their country countries are operational</text>
  <text start="894.08" dur="5.8">they won&amp;#39;t need the central bank</text>
  <text start="896.91" dur="5.49">printing press they will not need to</text>
  <text start="899.88" dur="4.31">keep US dollars in reserve and that</text>
  <text start="902.4" dur="5.12">really the Federal Reserve Note and</text>
  <text start="904.19" dur="7.86">they&amp;#39;ll be able to sustain themselves</text>
  <text start="907.52" dur="7.81">China Russia in many other countries</text>
  <text start="912.05" dur="6.34">would be able to do this other countries</text>
  <text start="915.33" dur="7.98">would struggle a little bit China and</text>
  <text start="918.39" dur="10.29">Russia had been setting up the one belt</text>
  <text start="923.31" dur="7.61">one road system for trade so we can see</text>
  <text start="928.68" dur="5.06">that China and Russia they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="930.92" dur="5.14">making a lot of bilateral trade deals</text>
  <text start="933.74" dur="8.59">Trump has been making a lot of bilateral</text>
  <text start="936.06" dur="10.26">trade deals and in this way gold would</text>
  <text start="942.33" dur="6.51">eventually destroy the Fed Gold would</text>
  <text start="946.32" dur="4.5">eventually destroy</text>
  <text start="948.84" dur="3.39">the central banks in each one of these</text>
  <text start="950.82" dur="3.18">countries when I say central bank I mean</text>
  <text start="952.23" dur="6.06">a private central bank which is</text>
  <text start="954" dur="6.75">controlled by the Rothschild central</text>
  <text start="958.29" dur="4.86">bank you can have one of those in your</text>
  <text start="960.75" dur="5.4">country as long as the people control it</text>
  <text start="963.15" dur="7.23">like the Treasury where you create your</text>
  <text start="966.15" dur="7.26">own currency so if all these countries</text>
  <text start="970.38" dur="5.28">do this and they band together there</text>
  <text start="973.41" dur="4.65">might be some outliers that don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="975.66" dur="5.46">to go ahead go along with this but if</text>
  <text start="978.06" dur="5.34">the main countries do this we can see</text>
  <text start="981.12" dur="3.72">the central bank system completely</text>
  <text start="983.4" dur="4.01">implode now what about all this debt</text>
  <text start="984.84" dur="6.87">what about all this well guess what if</text>
  <text start="987.41" dur="7.24">the countries stick together the gold</text>
  <text start="991.71" dur="5.49">the value of the gold compared to the</text>
  <text start="994.65" dur="5.39">value of the paper and the debt well</text>
  <text start="997.2" dur="7.29">guess what there&amp;#39;d be no problem there</text>
  <text start="1000.04" dur="8.2">now we can see how Trump the Patriots</text>
  <text start="1004.49" dur="8.28">China Russia we could see how this could</text>
  <text start="1008.24" dur="6.27">actually work because we know from Q Q&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1012.77" dur="4.38">been telling us that all these countries</text>
