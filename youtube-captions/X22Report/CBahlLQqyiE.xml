  <text start="205.67" dur="6.36">individuals that have not done this as</text>
  <text start="208.579" dur="7.201">of yet but very interestingly we see</text>
  <text start="212.03" dur="6.39">that an executive at Disney has already</text>

  <text start="324.55" dur="4.8">Patriots wanted this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="327.16" dur="5.97">they wanted them to do this was planned</text>
  <text start="329.35" dur="6.3">out this just didn&amp;#39;t pop up and they</text>
  <text start="333.13" dur="4.86">wanted them to go down this path we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="335.65" dur="4.59">explain later why they want this to</text>
  <text start="337.99" dur="3.87">happen but the mainstream media and the</text>
  <text start="340.24" dur="3.21">deep state they are pushing the idea</text>
  <text start="341.86" dur="5.64">that Trump was trying to hide the phone</text>
  <text start="343.45" dur="8.07">calls of szalinski he was pushing a</text>
  <text start="347.5" dur="6.57">cover-up but it turns out that Obama he</text>
  <text start="351.52" dur="4.649">did the same exact thing and it has</text>
  <text start="354.07" dur="4.28">nothing to do with the cover-up it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="356.169" dur="5.011">procedure</text>
  <text start="358.35" dur="5.289">former national security adviser Susan</text>
  <text start="361.18" dur="5.18">Rice she acknowledged that the Obama</text>
  <text start="363.639" dur="5.161">administration moved transcripts of</text>
  <text start="366.36" dur="5.47">conversations with foreign leaders onto</text>
  <text start="368.8" dur="5.1">the same top secret server where the</text>
  <text start="371.83" dur="3.769">Trump administration stored his recent</text>
  <text start="373.9" dur="4.71">phone calls with ukrainian President</text>
  <text start="375.599" dur="6.161">Solinsky now the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="378.61" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;ve painted the use of this top</text>
  <text start="381.76" dur="3.99">secret server as proof that Trump was</text>
  <text start="383.56" dur="5.97">trying to cover-up the contents of his</text>
  <text start="385.75" dur="5.789">conversation with szalinski but how</text>
  <text start="389.53" dur="4.5">could it be a cover-up when Trump</text>
  <text start="391.539" dur="4.261">released it to the public who they never</text>
  <text start="394.03" dur="3.78">thought he was going to do this but</text>
  <text start="395.8" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re sticking to the same ridiculous</text>
  <text start="397.81" dur="4.109">story he&amp;#39;s covering it up but he</text>
  <text start="400.21" dur="2.28">released the transcript does that make</text>
  <text start="401.919" dur="4.411">any sense</text>
  <text start="402.49" dur="6.359">no the practice of securing presidential</text>
  <text start="406.33" dur="5.13">phone transcripts has been in use in the</text>
  <text start="408.849" dur="4.38">White House since 2017 after some</text>
  <text start="411.46" dur="4.32">sensitive conversations with foreign</text>
  <text start="413.229" dur="4.861">leaders were leaked to the press this is</text>
  <text start="415.78" dur="5.52">basically standard operating procedure</text>
  <text start="418.09" dur="6.24">and if a president wants to put his</text>
  <text start="421.3" dur="4.32">conversation on a secure server so it</text>
  <text start="424.33" dur="6.6">doesn&amp;#39;t get out there</text>
  <text start="425.62" dur="7.59">he has the right to do this and the</text>
  <text start="430.93" dur="5.25">mainstream media they&amp;#39;re making this a</text>
  <text start="433.21" dur="5.91">really big deal when it really isn&amp;#39;t but</text>
  <text start="436.18" dur="4.98">why because they never thought he was</text>
  <text start="439.12" dur="4.92">going to release his transcripts I mean</text>
  <text start="441.16" dur="5.58">the story would work a lot better for</text>
  <text start="444.04" dur="3.99">them if he never released the transcript</text>
  <text start="446.74" dur="3.12">then they can say oh look he&amp;#39;s covering</text>
  <text start="448.03" dur="3.9">it up he put it on a secure server he</text>
  <text start="449.86" dur="3.48">doesn&amp;#39;t want anyone to see it ah then</text>
  <text start="451.93" dur="3.21">they can use the whole entire narrative</text>
  <text start="453.34" dur="4.53">that he&amp;#39;s covering it up but he</text>
  <text start="455.14" dur="4.38">countered all of this by releasing his</text>
  <text start="457.87" dur="4.38">transcripts now we have the original</text>
  <text start="459.52" dur="5.16">transcripts and we have szalinski saying</text>
  <text start="462.25" dur="4.56">there&amp;#39;s nothing here but they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="464.68" dur="3.72">along with the whistleblower who didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="466.81" dur="2.67">even hear the conversation they got it</text>
  <text start="468.4" dur="5.1">from somebody else</text>
  <text start="469.48" dur="5.55">so it&amp;#39;s like playing telephone now as we</text>
  <text start="473.5" dur="3.6">discussed on Friday the whistleblower</text>

  <text start="481.9" dur="4.65">tweets that explains this but I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="483.7" dur="5.07">going to summarize all the tweets the</text>
  <text start="486.55" dur="4.35">deep state changed the requirements for</text>

  <text start="583.18" dur="4.349">an editorial note that is highly</text>

  <text start="618.76" dur="7.139">is did the deep state do this for one</text>
  <text start="622" dur="8.399">whistleblower no they did this so they</text>
  <text start="625.899" dur="7.05">can attack Trump DDoS style what does</text>
  <text start="630.399" dur="4.88">that mean that means a lot of people</text>
  <text start="632.949" dur="4.561">hitting him at once</text>
  <text start="635.279" dur="4.601">Brennan tweeted out the following there</text>
