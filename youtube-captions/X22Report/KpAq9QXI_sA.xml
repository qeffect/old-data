  <text start="141.95" dur="7.35">I just wanted a touch upon Facebook and</text>
  <text start="145.1" dur="7.109">Libra and Libra is really not a crypto</text>
  <text start="149.3" dur="7.2">currency it is centralized first of all</text>

  <text start="174.739" dur="7.47">current economic system that is the</text>

  <text start="184.76" dur="8.009">debt note into their new system their</text>
  <text start="188.66" dur="5.969">new system will then take over because</text>

  <text start="204.379" dur="6.091">they&amp;#39;ve been pounding it into us that</text>
  <text start="207.04" dur="4.68">Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies well</text>
  <text start="210.47" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re used for money laundering</text>

  <text start="225.92" dur="6.569">privacy you will know who&amp;#39;s doing what</text>
  <text start="229.43" dur="5.959">and this is exactly what the deep state</text>
  <text start="232.489" dur="6.36">the central banks want they want to know</text>
  <text start="235.389" dur="5.701">who is doing what and just like every</text>

  <text start="270.68" dur="7.01">opposite of what they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>

  <text start="285.56" dur="5.19">to start a brand new economic system</text>
  <text start="288.979" dur="4.141">because there&amp;#39;s billions of people on</text>

  <text start="300.99" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re repairing a brand new economic</text>
  <text start="304.32" dur="4.13">system away from the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="305.7" dur="4.71">away from the central bank system and</text>
  <text start="308.45" dur="3.94">what do you think the deep state is</text>
  <text start="310.41" dur="5.16">trying to do right now they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="312.39" dur="5.55">move everyone off of the system that we</text>
  <text start="315.57" dur="6.63">have currently today onto their system</text>
  <text start="317.94" dur="6.9">and this way no one will move to the</text>
  <text start="322.2" dur="5.04">patriot system they&amp;#39;re trying all these</text>
  <text start="324.84" dur="7.11">different types of tricks but it will</text>
  <text start="327.24" dur="7.59">not work now currently Trump and the</text>
  <text start="331.95" dur="6.12">Patriots they need to keep this entire</text>
  <text start="334.83" dur="5.52">economic system operational the GDP</text>
  <text start="338.07" dur="4.74">numbers came out today they were they</text>
  <text start="340.35" dur="4.38">were well above expectations Trump</text>
  <text start="342.81" dur="4.11">tweeted out the following the second</text>
  <text start="344.73" dur="4.26">quarter GDP up 2.1 percent not bad</text>
  <text start="346.92" dur="4.05">considering we had the very heavyweight</text>
  <text start="348.99" dur="4.68">of the Federal Reserve anchor wrapped</text>
  <text start="350.97" dur="6.45">around our neck almost no inflation USA</text>
  <text start="353.67" dur="6.69">is set to zoom once again what did he do</text>
  <text start="357.42" dur="6.75">he blamed all of this on the Federal</text>
  <text start="360.36" dur="5.52">Reserve he&amp;#39;s letting everyone know we</text>
  <text start="364.17" dur="3.93">would be doing a lot better if the</text>
  <text start="365.88" dur="7.65">Federal Reserve just did what I wanted</text>
  <text start="368.1" dur="6.81">them to do now the IMF they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="373.53" dur="3.78">and they&amp;#39;re continually telling us that</text>
  <text start="374.91" dur="4.68">the world growth is declining and</text>
  <text start="377.31" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re blaming this on Trump&amp;#39;s tariffs</text>
  <text start="379.59" dur="4.14">and they&amp;#39;re saying that growth is</text>
  <text start="381.93" dur="4.47">slowing it&amp;#39;s going to be an absolute</text>
  <text start="383.73" dur="5.37">disaster if there isn&amp;#39;t a trade deal it</text>
  <text start="386.4" dur="4.95">will collapse but when you really look</text>
  <text start="389.1" dur="4.92">at it and you look at what is really</text>
  <text start="391.35" dur="6">going on yes we have a slight slowdown</text>
  <text start="394.02" dur="6.6">and this has coming from the merchandise</text>
  <text start="397.35" dur="5.25">World Trade monitor and they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="400.62" dur="4.59">at the world trade volume imports</text>
  <text start="402.6" dur="6.09">exports of merchandise across the globe</text>
  <text start="405.21" dur="6.48">and they&amp;#39;ve seen an increase of 0.3% in</text>
  <text start="408.69" dur="5.88">May from April falling point six percent</text>
  <text start="411.69" dur="5.94">in the prior month and on a year-to-year</text>
  <text start="414.57" dur="5.49">basis that fell about 0.4 percent and it</text>
  <text start="417.63" dur="6">is down 2.1 percent from peak in October</text>
  <text start="420.06" dur="7.32">of 2018 now this is not that great but</text>
  <text start="423.63" dur="7.12">the entire system isn&amp;#39;t collapsing if we</text>
  <text start="427.38" dur="6.73">go back to the financial crisis you</text>
  <text start="430.75" dur="6.08">can actually see what it looks like when</text>
  <text start="434.11" dur="8.64">something completely collapses now</text>
  <text start="436.83" dur="8.83">during 2008-2009 the CPB world trade</text>
  <text start="442.75" dur="5.96">monitor their index we were at at that</text>
  <text start="445.66" dur="7.26">time at about a hundred and three 104</text>
  <text start="448.71" dur="5.95">the entire thing collapsed to about 83</text>
  <text start="452.92" dur="4.19">where are we today</text>
  <text start="454.66" dur="6.99">with the world trade index were around</text>
  <text start="457.11" dur="8.26">122 why because most of this is based on</text>
  <text start="461.65" dur="6.38">people spending money think about that</text>
  <text start="465.37" dur="8.13">for a second if the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="468.03" dur="7.72">raises rates and people don&amp;#39;t take out</text>
  <text start="473.5" dur="4.41">mortgages people don&amp;#39;t purchase</text>
  <text start="475.75" dur="6.59">automobiles people don&amp;#39;t use their</text>
  <text start="477.91" dur="7.47">credit cards spending slows if Trump</text>
  <text start="482.34" dur="5.23">pushes his agenda like he&amp;#39;s doing having</text>
  <text start="485.38" dur="4.38">the Federal Reserve lower interest rates</text>
  <text start="487.57" dur="5.33">what do people do well now they can</text>
  <text start="489.76" dur="5.69">afford a house which means lumber tar</text>
  <text start="492.9" dur="5.32">copper and everything else that picks up</text>
  <text start="495.45" dur="5.41">people can afford an automobile because</text>
  <text start="498.22" dur="4.17">interest rates are very low people will</text>
  <text start="500.86" dur="4.61">use their credit cards because interest</text>
  <text start="502.39" dur="7.11">rates are very low and people will spend</text>
  <text start="505.47" dur="6.759">this is what Trump is trying to do he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="509.5" dur="5.31">trying to keep the system alive with</text>
  <text start="512.229" dur="5.221">people spending with corporations and</text>
  <text start="514.81" dur="5.22">businesses taking out loans and spending</text>
  <text start="517.45" dur="4.709">and buying a lot of material and</text>
  <text start="520.03" dur="4.53">everything like that we&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="522.159" dur="5.371">close to a collapse in world trade</text>
  <text start="524.56" dur="5.76">growth now if the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="527.53" dur="5.1">doesn&amp;#39;t do what Trump wants and they</text>
  <text start="530.32" dur="4.769">continually raise the rates and they did</text>
  <text start="532.63" dur="5.55">what they were planning to do yes world</text>
  <text start="535.089" dur="6.841">trade growth would completely implode on</text>
  <text start="538.18" dur="6.57">itself just like it did in 2008-2009 and</text>
  <text start="541.93" dur="5.31">then it slowly picked it swell itself</text>
  <text start="544.75" dur="5.339">back up because what did the Fed do</text>
  <text start="547.24" dur="5.28">let&amp;#39;s see they introduced stimulus they</text>
  <text start="550.089" dur="4.5">introduced lower rates and they</text>
  <text start="552.52" dur="5.4">continued to do this over and over and</text>
  <text start="554.589" dur="7.021">over and it&amp;#39;s starting to slow because</text>
  <text start="557.92" dur="6.52">they started to reverse course and you</text>
  <text start="561.61" dur="6.789">can see this now Trump</text>
  <text start="564.44" dur="8.24">he came out today and he is going after</text>
  <text start="568.399" dur="6.901">the globalist trade system now he</text>
  <text start="572.68" dur="5.26">removed a lot of the globalist trade</text>
  <text start="575.3" dur="5.849">deals he replaced it with bilateral</text>
  <text start="577.94" dur="5.249">trade deals and it looks like he is now</text>
  <text start="581.149" dur="4.56">moving at lightning speed there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="583.189" dur="4.561">nothing to keep him back he tweeted out</text>
  <text start="585.709" dur="3.99">the following the World Trade</text>
  <text start="587.75" dur="4.47">Organization is broken when the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="589.699" dur="4.08">richest countries claim to be developing</text>

  <text start="599.689" dur="4.2">US Trade Representative to take action</text>
  <text start="601.699" dur="7.351">so that country stopped cheating the</text>
  <text start="603.889" dur="7.531">system at the expense of the US and</text>
  <text start="609.05" dur="5.969">again this whole entire system this</text>
  <text start="611.42" dur="7.44">globalist system was designed to be</text>
  <text start="615.019" dur="6.031">against the United States why because</text>
  <text start="618.86" dur="4.32">they were moving everything out of the</text>
  <text start="621.05" dur="4.62">United States there were evening the</text>
  <text start="623.18" dur="6.659">playing field so this way they can have</text>
