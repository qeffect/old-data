  <text start="189.06" dur="6.84">now let&amp;#39;s think about this does this</text>
  <text start="191.549" dur="7.421">mean that people out in the Midwest and</text>

  <text start="210.34" dur="5.399">he talking about something else I do</text>
  <text start="213.459" dur="5.911">believe he&amp;#39;s talking about something</text>
  <text start="215.739" dur="5.491">completely different we talked about</text>
  <text start="219.37" dur="5.85">this before when Trump brought up the</text>
  <text start="221.23" dur="9.119">vibe gee the blockchain system runs</text>
  <text start="225.22" dur="8.25">beautifully on 5g it needs this speed 5g</text>
  <text start="230.349" dur="5.691">and blockchain and their combination can</text>
  <text start="233.47" dur="5.82">lead to an epoch-making change in</text>
  <text start="236.04" dur="5.319">everyday life of people blockchain</text>
  <text start="239.29" dur="3.75">technology could operate at this level</text>
  <text start="241.359" dur="4.831">which with its characteristic of</text>
  <text start="243.04" dur="5.069">unchanged ability and intrinsic security</text>
  <text start="246.19" dur="4.5">allows the transmission of data and</text>
  <text start="248.109" dur="6.331">payment activities to be carried out in</text>
  <text start="250.69" dur="7.079">a safe and non infringing manner the</text>
  <text start="254.44" dur="5.579">public blotching could act as a contact</text>
  <text start="257.769" dur="4.951">element between the widespread IOT and</text>
  <text start="260.019" dur="4.561">cities homes and means of transport and</text>
  <text start="262.72" dur="5.18">the 5g network thus becoming the</text>
  <text start="264.58" dur="6.839">protector of our privacy and payments</text>
  <text start="267.9" dur="5.139">now we need to understand that there are</text>
  <text start="271.419" dur="3.331">many things happening all at once and</text>
  <text start="273.039" dur="4.681">people say well you&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="274.75" dur="5.55">blockchain what about gold listen we</text>
  <text start="277.72" dur="4.979">have fiat currency today do we have gold</text>
  <text start="280.3" dur="4.82">of course we do do we have silver of</text>
  <text start="282.699" dur="6.211">course we do</text>
  <text start="285.12" dur="7.72">Gold is an insurance policy Gold is the</text>
  <text start="288.91" dur="7.89">wealth but you need a method of doing</text>
  <text start="292.84" dur="6.419">business of transacting and</text>
  <text start="296.8" dur="5.31">you can&amp;#39;t carry around gold you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="299.259" dur="6">have gold in your pocket you need some</text>
  <text start="302.11" dur="7.32">other transport mechanism and I do</text>
  <text start="305.259" dur="7.711">believe blockchain is going to do this I</text>
  <text start="309.43" dur="7.01">do believe that Trump is preparing the</text>
  <text start="312.97" dur="8.009">United States for this technology</text>
  <text start="316.44" dur="8.17">because once the central bank system is</text>
  <text start="320.979" dur="6.631">brought down and the Fiat system is</text>
  <text start="324.61" dur="6.75">brought to its needs and the central</text>
  <text start="327.61" dur="8.61">bank is exposed they are preparing to</text>
  <text start="331.36" dur="8.61">transition us into an electronic system</text>
  <text start="336.22" dur="7.319">yes gold is going to destroy the Fed yes</text>
  <text start="339.97" dur="8.78">Gold is the store of wealth</text>
  <text start="343.539" dur="9.901">yes the blockchain can be used with gold</text>
  <text start="348.75" dur="6.969">yes we can use it today we just need the</text>
  <text start="353.44" dur="5.099">infrastructure and I do believe this is</text>
  <text start="355.719" dur="5.04">what Trump is pushing for right now to</text>
  <text start="358.539" dur="5.581">bring us to the point where we can</text>
  <text start="360.759" dur="7.19">transition into this new economy and</text>
  <text start="364.12" dur="7.949">he&amp;#39;s laying the groundwork right now and</text>
  <text start="367.949" dur="6.94">you can see that he is not letting up on</text>
  <text start="372.069" dur="5.521">the Fed on the central bank system he</text>
  <text start="374.889" dur="6.361">tweeted out today if the Fed had done</text>
  <text start="377.59" dur="6.09">its job properly which it has not the</text>
  <text start="381.25" dur="5.639">stock market would have been up 5,000 to</text>
  <text start="383.68" dur="5.16">10,000 additional points and GDP would</text>
  <text start="386.889" dur="4.951">have been well over 4% instead of 3%</text>
  <text start="388.84" dur="5.579">with almost no inflation quantitative</text>
  <text start="391.84" dur="5.49">tightening was a killer should have done</text>
  <text start="394.419" dur="5.671">the exact opposite so what is Trump</text>
  <text start="397.33" dur="5.25">doing right now he&amp;#39;s pointing the finger</text>
  <text start="400.09" dur="5.549">at the central bank letting everyone</text>
  <text start="402.58" dur="6.179">know that because of what the Fed did</text>
  <text start="405.639" dur="6">the economy could have been a lot</text>
  <text start="408.759" dur="5.431">stronger a lot better now</text>
  <text start="411.639" dur="4.5">is this a real economy it&amp;#39;s just the</text>
  <text start="414.19" dur="4.44">economy that he&amp;#39;s pushing for it know</text>
  <text start="416.139" dur="5.43">what he&amp;#39;s doing he&amp;#39;s pointing out the</text>
  <text start="418.63" dur="5.909">central bank building the narrative and</text>
  <text start="421.569" dur="5.97">if you notice he&amp;#39;s doing this a lot more</text>
  <text start="424.539" dur="6">often now and you can see the central</text>
  <text start="427.539" dur="3.581">bank system well they&amp;#39;re starting to get</text>
  <text start="430.539" dur="2.591">too</text>
  <text start="431.12" dur="4.53">if we talked about all the articles</text>
  <text start="433.13" dur="4.2">about how the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="435.65" dur="4.86">independence is being questioned right</text>
  <text start="437.33" dur="5.22">now Lagarde was asked whether some</text>
  <text start="440.51" dur="3.719">central banks were facing threats to</text>
  <text start="442.55" dur="4.71">their independence and sending monetary</text>
  <text start="444.229" dur="5.19">policy she responded independence has</text>
  <text start="447.26" dur="6.21">served them well in the course of time</text>
  <text start="449.419" dur="6.601">and will continue to do so what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="453.47" dur="6.78">happening here is they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="456.02" dur="6.54">defend themselves because they</text>
  <text start="460.25" dur="4.86">understand that everything that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="462.56" dur="5.1">doing is being questioned and you can</text>
  <text start="465.11" dur="6.54">see that Christine Lagarde she is</text>
  <text start="467.66" dur="7.61">heading off what is coming she continued</text>
  <text start="471.65" dur="6.66">to say the following transparency and</text>
  <text start="475.27" dur="5.35">effective communication were key</text>
  <text start="478.31" dur="5.22">components for central banks to be</text>
  <text start="480.62" dur="6.769">credible in delivering their mandates</text>
  <text start="483.53" dur="5.28">really central banks are transparent</text>
  <text start="487.389" dur="4.271">absolutely not</text>
  <text start="488.81" dur="6.45">she&amp;#39;s trying to head off what is coming</text>
  <text start="491.66" dur="6.35">what is coming well the call to see what</text>
  <text start="495.26" dur="6.27">these central banks have been up to and</text>
  <text start="498.01" dur="6.85">we can see right now that Trump is</text>
  <text start="501.53" dur="7.44">taking shots at the Federal Reserve at</text>
  <text start="504.86" dur="9.57">the central bank system and pointing the</text>
  <text start="508.97" dur="8.069">finger at why they are responsible for</text>
  <text start="514.43" dur="4.65">when the economy comes down so at the</text>
