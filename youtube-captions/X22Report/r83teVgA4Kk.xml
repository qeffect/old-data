  <text start="53.14" dur="5.04">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="56.739" dur="5.011">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.18" dur="6.75">episode 1314 a and today&amp;#39;s date is June</text>
  <text start="61.75" dur="5.85">23rd 2017 and the plot of the episode is</text>
  <text start="64.93" dur="6.87">everything is in place a Fed unwind is</text>
  <text start="67.6" dur="6.33">the last step this is the warning let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="71.8" dur="4.22">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="73.93" dur="5.61">news now in the past couple of years</text>
  <text start="76.02" dur="6.58">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing our politicians out</text>
  <text start="79.54" dur="4.74">there pushing the idea that everyone</text>
  <text start="82.6" dur="3.689">needs to get a raise they need to</text>
  <text start="84.28" dur="5.759">continually raise minimum wage and yes</text>
  <text start="86.289" dur="6.991">this does help in the short run the</text>
  <text start="90.039" dur="5.22">problem is is that with technology and</text>
  <text start="93.28" dur="5.839">everything that is changing right now as</text>
  <text start="95.259" dur="6.181">we keep raising the minimum wage the</text>
  <text start="99.119" dur="4.181">corporations are going to turn to</text>
  <text start="101.44" dur="6.42">automation they&amp;#39;re going to move away</text>
  <text start="103.3" dur="6.66">from paying individual people and we see</text>
  <text start="107.86" dur="5.46">this happening right now now we need to</text>
  <text start="109.96" dur="6.18">go to the root of the problem the value</text>
  <text start="113.32" dur="5.22">of the dollar continually decreases</text>
  <text start="116.14" dur="5.64">which makes the purchasing power of the</text>
  <text start="118.54" dur="6.81">dollar decrease which means there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="121.78" dur="7.38">inflation which we are seeing and this</text>
  <text start="125.35" dur="7.65">is why you continually need to raise the</text>
  <text start="129.16" dur="6.69">minimum wage because as you&amp;#39;re set at a</text>
  <text start="133" dur="5.67">certain rate and the value of the dollar</text>
  <text start="135.85" dur="3.449">continually decreases you can&amp;#39;t live</text>
  <text start="138.67" dur="2.94">anymore</text>
  <text start="139.299" dur="5.131">that&amp;#39;s why the older generation who are</text>
  <text start="141.61" dur="6.09">on a fixed rate right now when food goes</text>
  <text start="144.43" dur="6">up when rent goes up or anything else</text>
  <text start="147.7" dur="5.19">health health insurance goes up they</text>
  <text start="150.43" dur="7.07">need to take a part-time job because</text>
  <text start="152.89" dur="7.92">their fixed income cannot work with the</text>
  <text start="157.5" dur="5.92">devaluation of the dollar now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="160.81" dur="4.86">happening here is that corporations</text>
  <text start="163.42" dur="5.61">right now like McDonald&amp;#39;s they are</text>
  <text start="165.67" dur="5.64">turning towards like these food service</text>
  <text start="169.03" dur="5.13">ATM machines so instead of paying</text>
  <text start="171.31" dur="5.04">someone $15 an hour they will purchase</text>
  <text start="174.16" dur="4.71">these machines they don&amp;#39;t have to worry</text>
  <text start="176.35" dur="4.5">about workman&amp;#39;s compensation they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="178.87" dur="3.66">have to worry about scheduling hours</text>
  <text start="180.85" dur="3.719">they don&amp;#39;t have to worry about someone</text>
  <text start="182.53" dur="4.17">being sick because the machine is always</text>
  <text start="184.569" dur="4.591">there yes a machine will break down</text>
  <text start="186.7" dur="4.59">but they still have other machines that</text>
  <text start="189.16" dur="4.53">are there take your order we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="191.29" dur="5.72">seeing this in many of the department</text>
  <text start="193.69" dur="5.96">stores many of the home building type of</text>
  <text start="197.01" dur="5.88">environments like Home Depot or Walmart</text>
  <text start="199.65" dur="6.99">where you have self checkout and</text>
  <text start="202.89" dur="7.03">everything is turning this way where</text>
  <text start="206.64" dur="4.78">individuals will no longer help you</text>
  <text start="209.92" dur="3.87">you&amp;#39;ll just go to the Machine and you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="211.42" dur="5.22">do everything yourself because what is</text>
  <text start="213.79" dur="5.43">happening we&amp;#39;re at that point where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="216.64" dur="5.97">not cost-effective anymore and this</text>
  <text start="219.22" dur="4.71">system needs to go away because again we</text>
  <text start="222.61" dur="3.57">could see throughout the country with</text>
  <text start="223.93" dur="4.11">all the regulations and devaluation of</text>
  <text start="226.18" dur="4.139">the dollar corporations they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="228.04" dur="5.07">staying in America they&amp;#39;ve been leaving</text>
  <text start="230.319" dur="5.101">and this trend is continuing even though</text>
  <text start="233.11" dur="3.84">Trump is out there and he&amp;#39;s promising</text>
  <text start="235.42" dur="4.23">manufacturing is coming back he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="236.95" dur="5.849">promising jobs are coming back this will</text>
  <text start="239.65" dur="5.52">not happen until the reset occurs and</text>
  <text start="242.799" dur="6.211">that&amp;#39;s what all these promises are about</text>
  <text start="245.17" dur="6.21">that they will come back to the US if he</text>
  <text start="249.01" dur="4.89">and others can make things right here</text>
  <text start="251.38" dur="4.32">now again this is their plan this is</text>
  <text start="253.9" dur="4.23">what they want to do we&amp;#39;ll have to see</text>
  <text start="255.7" dur="4.529">if it pans out now today the new home</text>
  <text start="258.13" dur="3.479">sales those figures came out the</text>
  <text start="260.229" dur="3.06">corporate media is out there saying no</text>
  <text start="261.609" dur="3.571">everything&amp;#39;s bouncing back new home</text>
  <text start="263.289" dur="4.081">sales are up 2.9 percent</text>
  <text start="265.18" dur="4.26">everything looks fantastic now remember</text>
  <text start="267.37" dur="3.96">back in April they plunged by eleven</text>
  <text start="269.44" dur="5.07">point four percent they were revised as</text>
  <text start="271.33" dur="5.04">a seven point nine percent drop instead</text>
  <text start="274.51" dur="4.159">of eleven point four percent drop and</text>
  <text start="276.37" dur="6.03">when we look at this we can say well</text>
  <text start="278.669" dur="6.22">this whole new home sale reporting well</text>
  <text start="282.4" dur="4.71">it kind of borders on fake news now we</text>
  <text start="284.889" dur="7.051">need to remember new home sales</text>
  <text start="287.11" dur="8.1">represent about 10% of total home sales</text>
  <text start="291.94" dur="4.59">now today&amp;#39;s report when we look at it</text>
  <text start="295.21" dur="2.94">and this is coming from the Census</text>
  <text start="296.53" dur="4.319">Bureau report that new home sales</text>
  <text start="298.15" dur="5.46">increased by 2.9 percent over April yet</text>
  <text start="300.849" dur="4.651">at the 90 percent level of confidence</text>
  <text start="303.61" dur="4.86">new home sales might have been anywhere</text>
  <text start="305.5" dur="6.21">from down by 10 percent to up to 15</text>
  <text start="308.47" dur="6.93">percent most likely it&amp;#39;s probably in the</text>
  <text start="311.71" dur="8.579">downward side but remember April&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="315.4" dur="7.56">number was revised upward by 24,000 now</text>
  <text start="320.289" dur="6.451">make matters worse new home sales are</text>
  <text start="322.96" dur="6.03">based on contracts signed often a down</text>
  <text start="326.74" dur="5.37">payment and almost always financing are</text>
  <text start="328.99" dur="5.009">not yet in place the contract</text>
  <text start="332.11" dur="3.63">cancellation percentage rate for new</text>
  <text start="333.999" dur="2.64">homes typically runs in the mid to</text>
  <text start="335.74" dur="3.81">high-teens</text>
  <text start="336.639" dur="6.03">by the way the Census Bureau does not</text>
  <text start="339.55" dur="6.869">incorporate cancellations into its data</text>
  <text start="342.669" dur="5.78">or its historical revisions to</text>
  <text start="346.419" dur="4.5">demonstrate how the seasonal adjustment</text>
  <text start="348.449" dur="5.2">magically transformed monthly data into</text>
  <text start="350.919" dur="6.571">many more thousands of annualized rate</text>
  <text start="353.649" dur="5.91">sales consider this the not seasonally</text>
  <text start="357.49" dur="3.87">adjusted number which is presented at</text>
  <text start="359.559" dur="3.931">the bottom of the Seabees report and</text>
  <text start="361.36" dur="6.839">never discussed by the media or Wall</text>
  <text start="363.49" dur="8.819">Street is 58 thousand an increase of one</text>
  <text start="368.199" dur="7.851">thousand homes over April&amp;#39;s not adjusted</text>
  <text start="372.309" dur="6.44">number and yet the reported headline and</text>
  <text start="376.05" dur="5.319">maybe we can consider this fake news</text>
  <text start="378.749" dur="5.26">wants us to believe that six hundred and</text>
  <text start="381.369" dur="5.1">ten thousand homes were sold on an</text>
  <text start="384.009" dur="5.19">annualized rate basis an increase of</text>
  <text start="386.469" dur="4.73">seventeen thousand over April it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="389.199" dur="4.68">nothing short of idiotic especially</text>
  <text start="391.199" dur="5.2">considering the reported average sales</text>
  <text start="393.879" dur="6.481">price was ten percent higher in May</text>
  <text start="396.399" dur="7.92">verse April now if today&amp;#39;s reported</text>
  <text start="400.36" dur="6.179">number is even remotely correct how come</text>
  <text start="404.319" dur="4.011">home builders had been cutting back on</text>
  <text start="406.539" dur="5.34">housing starts for the last three months</text>
  <text start="408.33" dur="6.789">the last time starts declined three</text>
  <text start="411.879" dur="5.64">consecutive month with late 2008 the new</text>
  <text start="415.119" dur="5.79">home sales report for May is in all</text>
  <text start="417.519" dur="5.64">probability fake news and we can see</text>
  <text start="420.909" dur="4.921">this is what they do they manipulate the</text>
  <text start="423.159" dur="4.141">numbers to make it look like things are</text>
  <text start="425.83" dur="3.869">a lot better than they are</text>
  <text start="427.3" dur="4.589">and we can see that they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="429.699" dur="5.61">this for a very long time to keep the</text>
  <text start="431.889" dur="6.18">illusion that the economy&amp;#39;s doing well</text>
  <text start="435.309" dur="5.31">now tomorrow Saturday I&amp;#39;m going to be</text>
  <text start="438.069" dur="5.731">uploading an interview with wolf Richter</text>
  <text start="440.619" dur="7.26">now he breaks all this down and actually</text>
  <text start="443.8" dur="5.639">he lays out how the economy is going to</text>
  <text start="447.879" dur="4.47">come down he has two different scenarios</text>
  <text start="449.439" dur="4.711">and one is a lot better than the other</text>
  <text start="452.349" dur="3.601">but he doesn&amp;#39;t know which one</text>
  <text start="454.15" dur="3.72">going to play out but he can see that</text>
  <text start="455.95" dur="3.96">all these bubbles retail and everything</text>
  <text start="457.87" dur="4.56">else everything is completely falling</text>
  <text start="459.91" dur="4.5">apart so tomorrow morning Saturday at</text>

  <text start="481.09" dur="7.74">places and you can watch the video now</text>
  <text start="483.36" dur="8.98">the Fed came out and they did an annual</text>
  <text start="488.83" dur="6.69">stress test and they said there are 34</text>
  <text start="492.34" dur="6">banks that they tested they they will</text>
  <text start="495.52" dur="5.04">survive a recession everything looks</text>
  <text start="498.34" dur="4.86">great and we know that these stress</text>
  <text start="500.56" dur="4.8">tests they&amp;#39;re pretty much fake phony and</text>
  <text start="503.2" dur="5.37">false it&amp;#39;s to make us feel a lot better</text>
  <text start="505.36" dur="5.34">since the 2008 crisis remember what</text>
  <text start="508.57" dur="5.21">happens each time there&amp;#39;s a major crisis</text>
  <text start="510.7" dur="5.7">go back in 1929 all of a sudden we had</text>
  <text start="513.78" dur="4">insurance for the deposits because no</text>
  <text start="516.4" dur="4.29">one trusted the banks because people</text>
  <text start="517.78" dur="4.77">lost a lot of money after 2008 what</text>
  <text start="520.69" dur="4.11">happened people didn&amp;#39;t trust the banking</text>
  <text start="522.55" dur="4.98">system so they said okay we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="524.8" dur="5.7">set up stress tests plus your deposits</text>
  <text start="527.53" dur="6.15">are insured up to 250,000 dollars to</text>
  <text start="530.5" dur="5.13">make people feel like your money is safe</text>
  <text start="533.68" dur="3.69">except they created the beylin documents</text>
  <text start="535.63" dur="3.15">which they&amp;#39;re just going to take your</text>
  <text start="537.37" dur="4.74">money from inside the bank</text>
  <text start="538.78" dur="4.14">so is your currency inside the bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="542.11" dur="4.05">really safe</text>
  <text start="542.92" dur="6.06">not really so they did the stress test</text>
  <text start="546.16" dur="5.22">and they&amp;#39;re out there you know parading</text>
  <text start="548.98" dur="4.14">around saying that if there is any type</text>
  <text start="551.38" dur="5.25">of recession any type of depression</text>
  <text start="553.12" dur="5.52">don&amp;#39;t worry these banks they are strong</text>
  <text start="556.63" dur="5.67">and they will be able to ride out the</text>
  <text start="558.64" dur="5.96">storm the problem is is the Fed has a</text>
  <text start="562.3" dur="5.19">problem with the credit card debt and</text>
  <text start="564.6" dur="5.98">this is generally the most expensive and</text>
  <text start="567.49" dur="6.48">risky debt for consumers has now moved</text>
  <text start="570.58" dur="6.75">to the top of the feds worry list in the</text>
  <text start="573.97" dur="6.24">severely adverse scenario of the stress</text>
  <text start="577.33" dur="5.52">test the projected losses for the 34</text>
  <text start="580.21" dur="6.39">largest banks not counting the losses of</text>
  <text start="582.85" dur="5.29">the 4,997 smaller banks are expected to</text>
  <text start="586.6" dur="4.63">hit about a hundred</text>
  <text start="588.14" dur="6.66">up nearly 9% from the stress test a year</text>
  <text start="591.23" dur="4.74">ago now the projected losses rose for</text>
  <text start="594.8" dur="3.06">several reasons including that the</text>
  <text start="595.97" dur="4.68">credit card balances well they&amp;#39;ve grown</text>
  <text start="597.86" dur="5.85">by 5.6 percent from a year ago to over a</text>
  <text start="600.65" dur="6.3">trillion dollars the delinquency rate</text>
  <text start="603.71" dur="5.58">has riven has risen to 2.4 percent now</text>
  <text start="606.95" dur="4.65">another worry of the Fed is the</text>
  <text start="609.29" dur="4.77">commercial and industrial loans whose</text>
  <text start="611.6" dur="5.67">balances are over twice as large two</text>
  <text start="614.06" dur="5.52">point one trillion dollars but whose</text>
  <text start="617.27" dur="5.22">projected losses are also pegged at a</text>
  <text start="619.58" dur="6.6">hundred billion in total the severely</text>
  <text start="622.49" dur="6.09">advanced scenario sees about 493 billion</text>
  <text start="626.18" dur="4.62">in losses for these 34 banks now you</text>
  <text start="628.58" dur="4.11">know this number is going to be triple</text>
  <text start="630.8" dur="3.63">of what they&amp;#39;re reporting when the</text>
  <text start="632.69" dur="5.46">losses start actually the probably in</text>
  <text start="634.43" dur="6.54">the trillions and we can see that right</text>
  <text start="638.15" dur="5.129">now that this has been put together to</text>
  <text start="640.97" dur="6.39">make us believe that the banks are</text>
  <text start="643.279" dur="7.171">strong now what we are seeing is that</text>
  <text start="647.36" dur="6.36">the Fed is preparing and getting ready</text>
  <text start="650.45" dur="5.19">for this collapse scenario and this is</text>
  <text start="653.72" dur="3.42">why they&amp;#39;re coming out with all this now</text>
  <text start="655.64" dur="3.6">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this is</text>
  <text start="657.14" dur="4.86">that st. Louis Fed President James</text>
  <text start="659.24" dur="5.4">Bullard he is out there saying listen</text>
  <text start="662" dur="6">maybe we shouldn&amp;#39;t raise the interest</text>
  <text start="664.64" dur="5.66">rates maybe we should wait and see how</text>
  <text start="668" dur="5.94">the economic developments and</text>
  <text start="670.3" dur="5.89">Washington&amp;#39;s policies play out in the</text>
  <text start="673.94" dur="4.86">coming quarters maybe we should just</text>
  <text start="676.19" dur="5.94">freeze everything to see what Trump does</text>
  <text start="678.8" dur="5.97">because right now Trump hasn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="682.13" dur="5.1">done nothing in the economy they passed</text>
  <text start="684.77" dur="5.069">a budget that will last until September</text>
  <text start="687.23" dur="6.06">30th they have the debt ceiling crisis</text>
  <text start="689.839" dur="5.971">still which is still there and the Fed</text>
  <text start="693.29" dur="6.36">right now is raising interest rates and</text>
  <text start="695.81" dur="6.51">most likely certain parts of the economy</text>

  <text start="702.32" dur="4.35">starting to rapidly fall apart which</text>
  <text start="704.06" dur="5.19">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing now remember the Fed</text>
  <text start="706.67" dur="4.8">now is going to start to unwind their</text>
  <text start="709.25" dur="4.17">balance sheet now remember the bull</text>
  <text start="711.47" dur="4.83">markets they&amp;#39;re driven by new capital</text>
  <text start="713.42" dur="4.86">you need more money for more buyers to</text>
  <text start="716.3" dur="3.73">increase buying pressure so the stock</text>
  <text start="718.28" dur="3.91">prices rise</text>
  <text start="720.03" dur="4.71">and it looks as though globally</text>
  <text start="722.19" dur="4.68">investors are tapped out after months of</text>
  <text start="724.74" dur="4.47">new capital pouring into the market</text>

  <text start="732" dur="6.84">little by a lot now this is a major</text>
  <text start="735.87" dur="4.94">warning sign throw in the fact that the</text>
  <text start="738.84" dur="5.72">Fed is now both raising rates and</text>
  <text start="740.81" dur="6.97">draining liquidity from the markets and</text>
  <text start="744.56" dur="6.4">there is their recipe for a serious</text>
  <text start="747.78" dur="4.92">market disruption to hit now the Fed has</text>
  <text start="750.96" dur="4.56">now announced that rather than</text>

  <text start="794.58" dur="7.23">liquidity in 2018 and this marks the</text>
  <text start="799.2" dur="5.55">first time in eight years that the Fed</text>
  <text start="801.81" dur="6.51">will not be actively providing liquidity</text>
  <text start="804.75" dur="7.29">to the US markets will this mark the top</text>
  <text start="808.32" dur="5.19">of the latest stock market bubble well</text>
  <text start="812.04" dur="3.18">we&amp;#39;ll have to see what happens we know</text>
  <text start="813.51" dur="3.9">that the markets are completely</text>
  <text start="815.22" dur="3.81">manipulated we know the central banks</text>
  <text start="817.41" dur="4.2">have been buying a lot of the tech</text>
  <text start="819.03" dur="5.72">stocks pumping all of this up we know</text>
  <text start="821.61" dur="6.9">the Fed has been feeding the market and</text>
  <text start="824.75" dur="6.4">again we&amp;#39;ll have to watch to see how</text>
  <text start="828.51" dur="4.29">this all plays out now we know that</text>
  <text start="831.15" dur="4.47">raising the interest rates we know</text>
  <text start="832.8" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;re unwinding this is a sure sign</text>
  <text start="835.62" dur="5.52">that they are getting ready for the next</text>
  <text start="838.83" dur="5.19">economic crisis that is going to happen</text>
  <text start="841.14" dur="5.55">because they know the next one is going</text>
  <text start="844.02" dur="5.28">to be the big one and it looks like</text>
  <text start="846.69" dur="6.66">they&amp;#39;re cleaning house right now to make</text>
  <text start="849.3" dur="5.82">room to bring on more toxic assets</text>
  <text start="853.35" dur="3.06">we know these bubbles around the country</text>
  <text start="855.12" dur="3.39">all these housing bubbles and everything</text>
  <text start="856.41" dur="5.37">else they&amp;#39;re all going to pop now</text>
  <text start="858.51" dur="6">remember a lot of this market that we</text>
  <text start="861.78" dur="5.61">are in today is one gigantic illusion a</text>
  <text start="864.51" dur="5.25">lot of these houses are owned by</text>
  <text start="867.39" dur="4.68">investment companies speculators hedge</text>
  <text start="869.76" dur="4.83">funds foreign investors they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="872.07" dur="5.1">owned by people so they&amp;#39;re just going to</text>
  <text start="874.59" dur="6.15">leave them who cares they&amp;#39;re just going</text>
  <text start="877.17" dur="5.07">to say ok I&amp;#39;m out the American people</text>
  <text start="880.74" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;ve been sitting on the sidelines</text>
  <text start="882.24" dur="6.33">and the stock market well this has been</text>
  <text start="886.32" dur="4.74">completely manipulated the central banks</text>
  <text start="888.57" dur="5.22">are in the market who&amp;#39;s going to take</text>
  <text start="891.06" dur="6">the fall for all of this think about it</text>
  <text start="893.79" dur="5.76">for a second when it comes down it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="897.06" dur="5.91">going to be horrific there&amp;#39;s no one else</text>
  <text start="899.55" dur="5.4">to pump this back up I mean yes the</text>
  <text start="902.97" dur="4.89">central bank can start stimulus once</text>
  <text start="904.95" dur="4.92">again which most likely they will and of</text>
  <text start="907.86" dur="5.28">course what they&amp;#39;re waiting for is Trump</text>
  <text start="909.87" dur="4.95">to set forth some type of policy because</text>
  <text start="913.14" dur="3.93">if they keep going the way they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="914.82" dur="4.74">and I think what happened now is they</text>
  <text start="917.07" dur="5.01">notice that their interest rate hikes</text>
  <text start="919.56" dur="4.5">has triggered certain economic sectors</text>
  <text start="922.08" dur="4.53">and they&amp;#39;re starting to deteriorate very</text>
  <text start="924.06" dur="4.89">very quickly they&amp;#39;re saying ok let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="926.61" dur="4.8">hold up right now let&amp;#39;s just wait a</text>
  <text start="928.95" dur="5.67">second let&amp;#39;s see what Trump does because</text>
  <text start="931.41" dur="5.82">our ultimate goal here is to blame him</text>
  <text start="934.62" dur="5.67">now if you notice he really hasn&amp;#39;t done</text>
  <text start="937.23" dur="6.12">anything and I think this is on purpose</text>
  <text start="940.29" dur="6.24">because this way the central bank is</text>
  <text start="943.35" dur="5.37">trapped if he does absolutely nothing to</text>
  <text start="946.53" dur="4.65">the economy and leaves it just the way</text>
  <text start="948.72" dur="4.65">Obama left it and let&amp;#39;s the central bank</text>
  <text start="951.18" dur="5.07">do everything he can turn around and say</text>
  <text start="953.37" dur="4.23">hey was it me this was all you you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="956.25" dur="3.24">the one who said raise the interest</text>
  <text start="957.6" dur="4.44">rates you&amp;#39;re the one who said I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="959.49" dur="6.54">to unwind my balance sheet this is</text>
  <text start="962.04" dur="6.72">Obama&amp;#39;s economy and if you notice Trump</text>
  <text start="966.03" dur="4.35">he might seem like he&amp;#39;s this fool that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="968.76" dur="3.57">running around doing crazy things I</text>
  <text start="970.38" dur="3.72">think this is what he wants the</text>
  <text start="972.33" dur="3.33">corporate media to believe I think he</text>
  <text start="974.1" dur="4.56">this is what he wants the Fed to believe</text>
  <text start="975.66" dur="7.52">I think he wants everyone to believe</text>
  <text start="978.66" dur="8.31">that this is how it is because again his</text>
  <text start="983.18" dur="6.459">greatest strength is to make everyone</text>
  <text start="986.97" dur="4.95">think one thing and do another member</text>
  <text start="989.639" dur="4.62">he&amp;#39;s been in business for a very long</text>
  <text start="991.92" dur="5.399">time he understands bankruptcy he</text>
  <text start="994.259" dur="4.44">understands the game maybe he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="997.319" dur="3.45">understand the political game but it</text>
  <text start="998.699" dur="5.07">looks like he&amp;#39;s getting that knowledge</text>
  <text start="1000.769" dur="5.61">very very quickly and he did a fast one</text>
  <text start="1003.769" dur="6.721">on Comey but we can see right now he is</text>
  <text start="1006.379" dur="7.14">a businessman he knows how to maneuver</text>
  <text start="1010.49" dur="6.029">around these individuals he knows how to</text>
  <text start="1013.519" dur="4.5">play with them he understands what needs</text>
  <text start="1016.519" dur="4.86">to be done and you can see right now</text>
  <text start="1018.019" dur="6.481">this is exactly what he&amp;#39;s doing and like</text>
  <text start="1021.379" dur="5.641">I said there is a race to gain the</text>
  <text start="1024.5" dur="6.27">narrative if you noticed with the case</text>
  <text start="1027.02" dur="6.689">of Comey who gained the narrative Trump</text>
  <text start="1030.77" dur="4.86">with the case of the economy coming down</text>
  <text start="1033.709" dur="5.041">he hasn&amp;#39;t done anything</text>
  <text start="1035.63" dur="7.199">we said this from the beginning he will</text>
  <text start="1038.75" dur="7.14">own the narrative the Fed did everything</text>
  <text start="1042.829" dur="5.191">that Fed raised the race the Fed was</text>
  <text start="1045.89" dur="4.71">starting to unwind the Fed said that we</text>
  <text start="1048.02" dur="4.5">have to do this we come off of Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1050.6" dur="5.37">economy who was supposed to be strong</text>
  <text start="1052.52" dur="7.529">and robust I haven&amp;#39;t touched it it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1055.97" dur="7.23">falling apart this is what he is pushing</text>
  <text start="1060.049" dur="4.951">right now they don&amp;#39;t see it I mean</text>
  <text start="1063.2" dur="3.9">Bullard is out there saying well wait a</text>
  <text start="1065" dur="4.14">minute we&amp;#39;re moving too fast there he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1067.1" dur="3.42">not doing anything and you can see</text>
  <text start="1069.14" dur="4.08">already they&amp;#39;re getting nervous about</text>
