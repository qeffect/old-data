  <text start="99.959" dur="5.071">collapse financial news now as we know</text>
  <text start="102.63" dur="6.15">Trump and the Patriots they have been</text>
  <text start="105.03" dur="5.699">doing everything possible to control the</text>
  <text start="108.78" dur="4.5">economic narrative which I do believe</text>
  <text start="110.729" dur="4.261">they have done because the central bank</text>
  <text start="113.28" dur="4.619">the deep state what they have been</text>
  <text start="114.99" dur="5.67">trying to do is completely the opposite</text>
  <text start="117.899" dur="5.871">because they for a very long time have</text>
  <text start="120.66" dur="6.12">been creating this system this system</text>
  <text start="123.77" dur="6.219">where they were going to be in control</text>
  <text start="126.78" dur="5.819">and they had completely different plans</text>
  <text start="129.989" dur="5.491">for the United States and Trump the</text>
  <text start="132.599" dur="5.701">Patriots they knew that the central bank</text>
  <text start="135.48" dur="5.25">system wasn&amp;#39;t going to last forever they</text>
  <text start="138.3" dur="5.79">knew they were going to have to either</text>
  <text start="140.73" dur="6.69">shut it down and restart a new economic</text>
  <text start="144.09" dur="6.33">system a lot of people would be hurt by</text>
  <text start="147.42" dur="7.02">doing this or come up with some other</text>
  <text start="150.42" dur="9.84">type of plan so I believe what they did</text>
  <text start="154.44" dur="8.01">was they created a central bank</text>
  <text start="160.26" dur="6.229">illusionary system based</text>
  <text start="162.45" dur="6.509">on their world what do I mean by this</text>
  <text start="166.489" dur="4.33">the central bank system is an</text>
  <text start="168.959" dur="4.381">illusionary system they control the</text>
  <text start="170.819" dur="4.711">stock market they control the interest</text>
  <text start="173.34" dur="4.83">rates they control the creation of</text>
  <text start="175.53" dur="7.739">currency it&amp;#39;s not an open and free</text>
  <text start="178.17" dur="8.49">market so they knew that they had to</text>
  <text start="183.269" dur="6.121">take what was given to them and use it</text>
  <text start="186.66" dur="5.49">against the deep state the central bank</text>
  <text start="189.39" dur="3.78">the mainstream media remember for years</text>
  <text start="192.15" dur="4.08">and years and years</text>
  <text start="193.17" dur="5.49">they tell us look at the holiday seasons</text>
  <text start="196.23" dur="4.979">look how much people have put on their</text>
  <text start="198.66" dur="5.49">credit card because that&amp;#39;s what they</text>
  <text start="201.209" dur="6.421">give us to let us know how the economy</text>
  <text start="204.15" dur="5.699">did with in regards to retail they say</text>
  <text start="207.63" dur="4.919">Oh MasterCard and Visa are reporting</text>
  <text start="209.849" dur="5.791">that people have charged this much on</text>
  <text start="212.549" dur="6.27">their cards this is how well the economy</text>
  <text start="215.64" dur="6.53">is doing now remember this is money that</text>
  <text start="218.819" dur="7.651">people really don&amp;#39;t have this is credit</text>
  <text start="222.17" dur="8.77">they have to pay it off if they can many</text>
  <text start="226.47" dur="6.419">people don&amp;#39;t the stock market over the</text>
  <text start="230.94" dur="3.57">many many years the mainstream media has</text>
  <text start="232.889" dur="7.141">been telling us that this is a gauge of</text>
  <text start="234.51" dur="9.84">the economy is it really know the</text>
  <text start="240.03" dur="8.039">mom-and-pop everyday person on the</text>
  <text start="244.35" dur="5.52">street feels the economy very very</text>
  <text start="248.069" dur="4.771">differently than what the stock market</text>
  <text start="249.87" dur="5.58">shows the stock market can continually</text>
  <text start="252.84" dur="5.549">move up but the people feel something</text>
  <text start="255.45" dur="7.5">different and Trump knew that he had to</text>
  <text start="258.389" dur="7.351">create this confidence in the entire</text>
  <text start="262.95" dur="5.25">economic system at the same time they</text>
  <text start="265.74" dur="6.09">were bringing back manufacturers jobs</text>
  <text start="268.2" dur="4.74">and resetting a lot of what has been</text>
  <text start="271.83" dur="3.559">going on for many years</text>
  <text start="272.94" dur="6.18">and this is exactly what they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="275.389" dur="6.701">they&amp;#39;re using all the central bank</text>
  <text start="279.12" dur="5.07">weapons against them look at the stock</text>

  <text start="628.43" dur="10.11">trajectory that is it has never been</text>
  <text start="632.66" dur="9.84">seen before by anyone alive we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="638.54" dur="7.41">to see a new system that does not</text>
  <text start="642.5" dur="5.76">include the central bank system where we</text>
  <text start="645.95" dur="4.95">have a private western central bank yes</text>
  <text start="648.26" dur="4.38">the United States government they will</text>
  <text start="650.9" dur="3.72">have a central bank which is the</text>
  <text start="652.64" dur="4.26">Treasury where people create their own</text>
  <text start="654.62" dur="5.34">currency we will no longer have a</text>
  <text start="656.9" dur="6.12">private western central bank system</text>
  <text start="659.96" dur="7.05">where there&amp;#39;s a few select that are</text>
  <text start="663.02" dur="6.48">controlling the creation of currency</text>
  <text start="667.01" dur="5.49">it&amp;#39;s that part of the government it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="669.5" dur="5.54">part of a few select that report up the</text>
  <text start="672.5" dur="6.18">chain all the way up to the Rothschild</text>
  <text start="675.04" dur="6.58">Trump is letting us know that we&amp;#39;re on a</text>
  <text start="678.68" dur="4.39">completely different trajectory and this</text>
  <text start="681.62" dur="6.37">is something that</text>
  <text start="683.07" dur="8.34">never been seen before and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="687.99" dur="6.99">to see an economy like we&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="691.41" dur="6.96">before we don&amp;#39;t need to have an economy</text>
  <text start="694.98" dur="6.72">where we have people that are very very</text>
  <text start="698.37" dur="6.6">poor and we have 1% that are very very</text>
  <text start="701.7" dur="7.11">wealthy remember go back in time go back</text>
  <text start="704.97" dur="6.42">to 1913 go forward and when we hit that</text>
  <text start="708.81" dur="6.72">period of 1971 when we came off the gold</text>
  <text start="711.39" dur="7.19">standard and we went complete Fiat look</text>
  <text start="715.53" dur="5.94">at what happened look at their plans</text>
  <text start="718.58" dur="7.92">this is what a central bank system does</text>
  <text start="721.47" dur="8.85">to an economic system we don&amp;#39;t need this</text>
  <text start="726.5" dur="6.61">we don&amp;#39;t need debt we don&amp;#39;t need credit</text>
  <text start="730.32" dur="5.7">cards we don&amp;#39;t need any of this the only</text>
  <text start="733.11" dur="7.22">reason we have these things is because</text>
  <text start="736.02" dur="9.57">the central bank system fails over time</text>
  <text start="740.33" dur="7.87">think about 71 when we came off the gold</text>
  <text start="745.59" dur="8.7">standard what happened we saw inflation</text>
  <text start="748.2" dur="9.12">if you noticed as we hit inflation what</text>
  <text start="754.29" dur="6.12">happened not just one person needed to</text>
  <text start="757.32" dur="6.3">work two people needed to work why did</text>
  <text start="760.41" dur="5.16">they introduce credit cards in the 80s</text>
  <text start="763.62" dur="4.8">yes I know there were gas cards before</text>
  <text start="765.57" dur="5.7">him but I&amp;#39;m talking mainstream because</text>
  <text start="768.42" dur="11.4">as we move forward as the system breaks</text>
