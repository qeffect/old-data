  <text start="55.15" dur="5.61">about mh370 how they&amp;#39;re finding the</text>
  <text start="56.98" dur="6.03">objects wingspan and a French newspaper</text>
  <text start="60.76" dur="3.869">back then said no these are not part of</text>
  <text start="63.01" dur="3.93">mh370 now we&amp;#39;re getting word from</text>
  <text start="64.629" dur="4.53">Australia that they&amp;#39;ve confirmed that</text>
  <text start="66.94" dur="4.98">yes these are the plane parts that</text>
  <text start="69.159" dur="6.841">washed up on the remote island and these</text>
  <text start="71.92" dur="5.97">are the parts from mh370 so right now we</text>
  <text start="76" dur="4.59">have two conflicting stories but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="77.89" dur="6.33">telling us that yes this is the plane</text>
  <text start="80.59" dur="7.85">parts so we&amp;#39;ll continually watch this</text>
  <text start="84.22" dur="7.41">observe what&amp;#39;s been going on and maybe</text>
  <text start="88.44" dur="7.15">we can find out what really happened to</text>
  <text start="91.63" dur="10.71">this airliner now we understand in South</text>
  <text start="95.59" dur="9.989">Sudan Kerry Obama the UN was forcing and</text>
  <text start="102.34" dur="6.059">pushing the South Sudanese government to</text>
  <text start="105.579" dur="4.5">sign the peace agreement and they</text>
  <text start="108.399" dur="3.15">finally did it they have agreed to</text>
  <text start="110.079" dur="5.371">declare permanent ceasefire and of</text>
  <text start="111.549" dur="5.82">course this didn&amp;#39;t hold and in this</text>
  <text start="115.45" dur="6.299">ceasefire agreement which I discussed</text>
  <text start="117.369" dur="7.29">before now we have confirmation they had</text>
  <text start="121.749" dur="5.491">to establish a transitional government</text>
  <text start="124.659" dur="5.82">now every single time the US government</text>
  <text start="127.24" dur="6.48">central bankers push a peace deal it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="130.479" dur="7.561">never in favor of the other side it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="133.72" dur="6.599">always with unrealistic terms you will</text>
  <text start="138.04" dur="5.06">step down we will take over that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="140.319" dur="5.821">pretty much it I mean look in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="143.1" dur="6.16">when poroshenko was out there saying</text>
  <text start="146.14" dur="5.88">okay here&amp;#39;s a ceasefire all you need to</text>
  <text start="149.26" dur="4.32">do is lay down your weapons and we will</text>
  <text start="152.02" dur="3.96">take over that area that was the peace</text>
  <text start="153.58" dur="4.71">deal the same thing is happening in</text>
  <text start="155.98" dur="5.25">Yemen everyone give up we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="158.29" dur="6">bring back the puppet government and we</text>
  <text start="161.23" dur="6.33">see the fighting has continued</text>
  <text start="164.29" dur="6.089">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all of</text>
  <text start="167.56" dur="3.92">this is why did the government and</text>
  <text start="170.379" dur="5.521">opposition</text>
  <text start="171.48" dur="6.94">sign this I mean they they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="175.9" dur="5.369">really agreeing to it they didn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="178.42" dur="7.26">want to sign it and then we find out</text>
  <text start="181.269" dur="6.541">that they were forced to do it and it</text>
  <text start="185.68" dur="5.389">looked bad if they didn&amp;#39;t sign a peace</text>
  <text start="187.81" dur="6.989">deal but when this was being drawn up</text>
  <text start="191.069" dur="6.07">Obama met when he was in Africa met with</text>
  <text start="194.799" dur="4.05">African leaders to discuss the South</text>
  <text start="197.139" dur="5.66">Sudanese conflict but deliberately</text>
  <text start="198.849" dur="7.47">excluded the parties to the conflict</text>
  <text start="202.799" dur="6.19">well then they do this in Ukraine with</text>
  <text start="206.319" dur="6.09">poroshenko he doesn&amp;#39;t talk to the South</text>
  <text start="208.989" dur="5.87">Eastern people he leaves them out of</text>
  <text start="212.409" dur="2.45">everything</text>
  <text start="215.459" dur="7.271">Obama&amp;#39;s consultation with the key</text>
  <text start="217.81" dur="8.73">stakeholders was going on except for the</text>
  <text start="222.73" dur="7.619">South Sudanese people so they created</text>
  <text start="226.54" dur="7.77">this ceasefire peace deal without them</text>
  <text start="230.349" dur="6.06">and they had to have a transitional</text>
  <text start="234.31" dur="3.989">government they were going to lose their</text>
  <text start="236.409" dur="7.431">power and we say this is not going to</text>
  <text start="238.299" dur="8.94">hold right now we see out in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="243.84" dur="5.41">Ukraine is trying to ramp up their caste</text>
  <text start="247.239" dur="4.08">deliveries you&amp;#39;re getting it from</text>
  <text start="249.25" dur="3.989">Slovakia they cut off supplies from</text>
  <text start="251.319" dur="6.181">Russia and now they made a deal with</text>
  <text start="253.239" dur="7.11">Lithuania / Poland the only problem is</text>
  <text start="257.5" dur="4.8">they need an inter connector to get the</text>
  <text start="260.349" dur="3.871">gas into Ukraine and they have to build</text>
  <text start="262.3" dur="4.29">this this will take two or three years</text>
  <text start="264.22" dur="3.99">so they really can&amp;#39;t get the gas from</text>
  <text start="266.59" dur="5.609">them but they&amp;#39;re making a deal to</text>
  <text start="268.21" dur="7.41">receive gas from them and poroshenko</text>
  <text start="272.199" dur="5.431">right now he assigned a directive</text>
  <text start="275.62" dur="5.4">authorizing a complex of measures aimed</text>
  <text start="277.63" dur="5.759">at creating a unified EU Ukraine</text>
  <text start="281.02" dur="5.76">airspace now this is something they need</text>
  <text start="283.389" dur="7.291">so they can join the European Union to</text>
  <text start="286.78" dur="5.129">have common airspace and he just signed</text>
  <text start="290.68" dur="3.51">that because we know this whole coup</text>
  <text start="291.909" dur="6.22">d&amp;#39;etat was to have Ukraine where the EU</text>
  <text start="294.19" dur="6.039">and NATO now Putin decided</text>
  <text start="298.129" dur="5.94">you speak up about the mints to</text>
  <text start="300.229" dur="8.91">agreement where we had President</text>
  <text start="304.069" dur="7.92">Hollande Angela Merkel Putin poroshenko</text>
  <text start="309.139" dur="4.28">they all met they talked about how</text>
  <text start="311.989" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re going to implement this and</text>
  <text start="313.419" dur="4.93">Putin said if we speak about the Minsk</text>
  <text start="315.889" dur="4.32">agreements I will recall amendments to</text>
  <text start="318.349" dur="5.43">the Constitution should be coordinated</text>
  <text start="320.209" dur="5.46">with Don Baz the law of Elections to</text>
  <text start="323.779" dur="3.54">local self-government bodies should be</text>
  <text start="325.669" dur="4.17">coordinated with Tom bass the law of</text>
  <text start="327.319" dur="5.1">amnesty should be adopted and he said it</text>
  <text start="329.839" dur="4.771">is not and the law on special status of</text>
  <text start="332.419" dur="6.27">these territories should be should be</text>
  <text start="334.61" dur="7.289">enacted it has been adopted but not</text>
  <text start="338.689" dur="7.801">enacted because it was postponed once</text>
  <text start="341.899" dur="8.33">again and he&amp;#39;s saying that Ukraine right</text>
  <text start="346.49" dur="7.829">now is being controlled by external</text>
  <text start="350.229" dur="6.071">powers and he&amp;#39;s absolutely right they</text>
  <text start="354.319" dur="3.93">are and we know who it is it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="356.3" dur="5.159">United States they&amp;#39;re doing everything</text>
  <text start="358.249" dur="5.13">possible to derail the ceasefire</text>
  <text start="361.459" dur="3.96">agreement and then of course then they</text>
  <text start="363.379" dur="5">turn it around and blame it on the</text>
  <text start="365.419" dur="8.191">southeastern people and of course Russia</text>
  <text start="368.379" dur="8.14">NATO right now is bringing in their tan</text>
  <text start="373.61" dur="5.88">tanks which is usually used in desert</text>
  <text start="376.519" dur="6.06">areas and these tanks are going to be</text>
  <text start="379.49" dur="6.239">deployed in Lithuania Poland Romania</text>
  <text start="382.579" dur="8.18">Latvia Estonia and they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="385.729" dur="7.68">repainting all of them to woodland green</text>
  <text start="390.759" dur="3.84">this way they blend into the forests and</text>
  <text start="393.409" dur="2.85">things like that</text>
  <text start="394.599" dur="3.61">Lieutenant General Ben Hodges</text>
  <text start="396.259" dur="7.62">specifically stressed the importance of</text>
  <text start="398.209" dur="7.49">the latest decision so we see them</text>
  <text start="403.879" dur="5.13">bringing in the weapons the tanks</text>
  <text start="405.699" dur="5.14">they&amp;#39;re camouflaging them and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="409.009" dur="5.07">going to be stationed in all of these</text>
  <text start="410.839" dur="5.01">countries because in June of 2015 US</text>
  <text start="414.079" dur="4.11">Defense Secretary Ashton Carter promised</text>
  <text start="415.849" dur="3.93">that the US will deploy heavy weapons</text>
  <text start="418.189" dur="4.111">including tanks armored vehicles</text>
  <text start="419.779" dur="7.49">artillery to all of these European</text>
  <text start="422.3" dur="9.91">nations and they are doing it right now</text>
  <text start="427.269" dur="8.511">now we know that China they&amp;#39;ve had their</text>
  <text start="432.21" dur="6.269">world war ii victory celebration parade</text>
  <text start="435.78" dur="5.91">and i named a lot of countries that were</text>
  <text start="438.479" dur="6.391">there and i said us was not on the list</text>
  <text start="441.69" dur="4.8">well we come to find out the reason</text>
  <text start="444.87" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re not on the list is because the</text>
  <text start="446.49" dur="8.58">west boycotted the celebration of the</text>
  <text start="450.78" dur="6.06">Victory Day Parade the only Americans</text>
  <text start="455.07" dur="4.65">that attended our American Veterans are</text>
  <text start="456.84" dur="6.93">the Flying Tigers that&amp;#39;s it the</text>
  <text start="459.72" dur="5.52">government boycotted it and then we hear</text>
  <text start="463.77" dur="2.97">all this talk and we talked about this</text>
  <text start="465.24" dur="4.29">yesterday about Chinese warships</text>
  <text start="466.74" dur="6.12">that came within 12 miles of the US</text>
  <text start="469.53" dur="5.4">coast and they&amp;#39;re in international</text>
  <text start="472.86" dur="4.649">waters they&amp;#39;re in the Bering Strait and</text>
  <text start="474.93" dur="8.28">if you look at a map you&amp;#39;ll see that</text>
  <text start="477.509" dur="8.461">Alaska and Russia are both there so if</text>
  <text start="483.21" dur="4.98">you you can make the case that the ships</text>
  <text start="485.97" dur="5.129">are off the coast of Russia the ships</text>
  <text start="488.19" dur="5.099">are off the coast of Alaska which way do</text>
  <text start="491.099" dur="4.711">you want to play this and it makes no</text>
  <text start="493.289" dur="6.421">sense because they&amp;#39;re in international</text>
  <text start="495.81" dur="5.7">waters just like the u.s. brings their</text>

  <text start="504.84" dur="9.06">China in international waters but no one</text>
  <text start="510.599" dur="8.19">makes a big deal of that I mean think</text>
  <text start="513.9" dur="7.97">about this the u.s. brings the ships</text>
  <text start="518.789" dur="7.701">into the Black Sea</text>

  <text start="777.4" dur="4.32">they had to use al-qaeda as the name</text>
  <text start="779.26" dur="4.68">because we know there was legislation</text>
  <text start="781.72" dur="3.66">that said the US can use drone attacks</text>
  <text start="783.94" dur="4.11">against al-qaeda that&amp;#39;s why they called</text>

  <text start="821.8" dur="5.88">some type of international coalition to</text>
  <text start="825.19" dur="5.13">fight this terrorism now he knows what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="827.68" dur="5.28">going on here and he&amp;#39;s putting the u.s.</text>
  <text start="830.32" dur="6.63">in a corner try</text>
  <text start="832.96" dur="7.29">to make them do something or to fold and</text>
  <text start="836.95" dur="4.41">say okay we&amp;#39;re not going to go forward</text>
  <text start="840.25" dur="2.64">with this but you know the United States</text>
  <text start="841.36" dur="3.5">is not going to do that they never back</text>
  <text start="842.89" dur="4.32">down they never admit when they&amp;#39;re wrong</text>
  <text start="844.86" dur="5.14">we know the Pentagon right now is</text>
  <text start="847.21" dur="5.1">shipping 1 billion worth of arms to the</text>
  <text start="850" dur="5.19">Middle East because of this Iran deal</text>
  <text start="852.31" dur="5.91">and we know this is not why all of this</text>
  <text start="855.19" dur="6.3">weaponry is going towards what is going</text>
  <text start="858.22" dur="5.82">to happen in Syria because we have to</text>
  <text start="861.49" dur="5.63">remember what John Kerry said there will</text>
  <text start="864.04" dur="7.89">be ground forces when the time is right</text>
  <text start="867.12" dur="9.21">in Yemen there is now talks about</text>
  <text start="871.93" dur="6.51">splitting Yemen into almost like Sudan</text>
  <text start="876.33" dur="4.12">almost like they wanted to do with Iraq</text>
  <text start="878.44" dur="3.54">because we know that Biden approached</text>
  <text start="880.45" dur="3.69">the prime minister in Iraq and said</text>
  <text start="881.98" dur="3.81">listen maybe we should split the country</text>
  <text start="884.14" dur="4.62">in two because this is their ultimate</text>
  <text start="885.79" dur="7.2">goal is to take all these countries and</text>
  <text start="888.76" dur="9">create a Sunni area a Shia area and a</text>
  <text start="892.99" dur="8.01">Kurdish area and we can see this has</text>
  <text start="897.76" dur="5.61">been their plan all along this way they</text>
  <text start="901" dur="6.78">can rule out the fighting that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="903.37" dur="7.02">going on now turkey their mandate was</text>
  <text start="907.78" dur="5.4">going to expire but they extended them</text>
  <text start="910.39" dur="4.38">their mandate to fight in Syria and Iraq</text>
  <text start="913.18" dur="3.87">which is really not surprising we knew</text>
  <text start="914.77" dur="5.16">they were going to do this now the US</text>
  <text start="917.05" dur="5.31">and the coalition forces are continually</text>
  <text start="919.93" dur="5.34">pushing the propaganda that they kill no</text>
  <text start="922.36" dur="5.34">civilians in Iraq and Syria our weaponry</text>
  <text start="925.27" dur="4.52">is so exact that no civilians have died</text>
  <text start="927.7" dur="5.76">well there&amp;#39;s been a newly declassified</text>
  <text start="929.79" dur="6.1">CENTCOM document published by air wars</text>
  <text start="933.46" dur="4.68">and an international media partner for</text>
  <text start="935.89" dur="5.07">the first time on Thursday which reveals</text>
  <text start="938.14" dur="5.52">by early May of this year that the</text>
  <text start="940.96" dur="5.7">Coalition had already internally</text>
  <text start="943.66" dur="5.25">investigated dozens of events involving</text>
  <text start="946.66" dur="5.07">at least 325 possible civilian deaths</text>
  <text start="948.91" dur="8.4">from air strikes and guess what yeah</text>
  <text start="951.73" dur="8.16">they&amp;#39;re killing civilians I mean the</text>
  <text start="957.31" dur="4.29">previous secret 14 page file obtained</text>
  <text start="959.89" dur="5.66">under the Freedom of Information Act by</text>
  <text start="961.6" dur="3.95">journalist Joseph Trevithick</text>
  <text start="966.18" dur="6.69">looked into this and yeah out of all</text>
  <text start="970.02" dur="7.14">these strikes think about it 6500 air</text>
  <text start="972.87" dur="8.18">strikes they&amp;#39;re reporting two deaths of</text>
  <text start="977.16" dur="7.71">civilians now there&amp;#39;s hundreds and</text>
  <text start="981.05" dur="6.7">hundreds of people who died in these air</text>
  <text start="984.87" dur="5.94">raids but they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="987.75" dur="5.61">everyone that no we&amp;#39;re hitting the</text>
  <text start="990.81" dur="6.06">Islamic state we&amp;#39;re hitting the proper</text>
  <text start="993.36" dur="4.95">targets come on it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="996.87" dur="3.74">impossible look what&amp;#39;s happening in</text>
  <text start="998.31" dur="4.68">Yemen with the set with Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="1000.61" dur="4.51">bombing they&amp;#39;re hitting civilians</text>
  <text start="1002.99" dur="5.73">hitting their infrastructure the same</text>
  <text start="1005.12" dur="7.7">thing is happening in Syria they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1008.72" dur="10.32">bombing and hitting infrastructure and</text>
  <text start="1012.82" dur="10.499">there are people that are dying so all</text>
  <text start="1019.04" dur="8.22">this talk about no civilians dying is</text>
  <text start="1023.319" dur="7.291">absolutely fake it&amp;#39;s false it&amp;#39;s phony</text>
  <text start="1027.26" dur="9.54">it&amp;#39;s distorted and they do this on</text>
  <text start="1030.61" dur="7.719">purpose just like the Pentagon realized</text>
  <text start="1036.8" dur="5.46">that their information that was coming</text>
  <text start="1038.329" dur="6.841">out from Syria that the bombings weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1042.26" dur="5.28">really hitting the Islamic state they</text>
  <text start="1045.17" dur="5.34">weren&amp;#39;t winning they were actually</text>
  <text start="1047.54" dur="7.56">losing the Islamic state has been</text>
  <text start="1050.51" dur="7.799">expanding in Syria not contracting all</text>
  <text start="1055.1" dur="5.76">of this is to deceive everyone to make</text>
  <text start="1058.309" dur="4.831">everyone believe yes we&amp;#39;re definitely</text>
  <text start="1060.86" dur="8.79">going after the Islamic state but</text>
  <text start="1063.14" dur="9.84">they&amp;#39;re not I mean they do this on</text>
  <text start="1069.65" dur="5.49">purpose to make everyone believe that</text>
  <text start="1072.98" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re going after terrorism now if</text>
  <text start="1075.14" dur="6.39">this is true then they should allow</text>
  <text start="1078.44" dur="4.86">China they should allow Russia in on the</text>
  <text start="1081.53" dur="6.81">fight against the terrorists but they</text>
  <text start="1083.3" dur="9.93">don&amp;#39;t want this to happen now Putin is</text>
  <text start="1088.34" dur="7.04">trying to broker a peace deal and he has</text>
  <text start="1093.23" dur="6.319">Assad willing to</text>
  <text start="1095.38" dur="8.07">basically allow the opposition to share</text>
  <text start="1099.549" dur="6.421">government power in Syria where he would</text>
  <text start="1103.45" dur="5.609">have elections and they would vote</text>
  <text start="1105.97" dur="5.64">someone in and they would share power</text>
  <text start="1109.059" dur="4.381">this is going to be very tricky here</text>
  <text start="1111.61" dur="3.66">because we know the US government</text>
  <text start="1113.44" dur="5.369">central bankers this is not what they</text>
  <text start="1115.27" dur="5.49">really want they want Assad out they</text>
  <text start="1118.809" dur="4.291">don&amp;#39;t want a sharing of power just like</text>
  <text start="1120.76" dur="5.789">in Sudan here&amp;#39;s the ceasefire deal</text>
  <text start="1123.1" dur="7.439">here&amp;#39;s the peace deal one of the points</text>
  <text start="1126.549" dur="6.87">of it is to remove yourself in the</text>
  <text start="1130.539" dur="4.951">government and will place a puppet</text>
  <text start="1133.419" dur="4.201">government in there this is what they</text>
  <text start="1135.49" dur="4.41">really want so are they going to go</text>
  <text start="1137.62" dur="3.66">along with this well Putin kind of has</text>
  <text start="1139.9" dur="5.25">them in them in a corner right now</text>
  <text start="1141.28" dur="6.649">because he&amp;#39;s brokering a peace deal the</text>
  <text start="1145.15" dur="5.22">opposition is going to have a seat and</text>
  <text start="1147.929" dur="4.63">it looks bad to the world if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1150.37" dur="4.23">agree so we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch</text>
  <text start="1152.559" dur="5.49">this very very carefully now we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="1154.6" dur="8.91">reports that Russia has been flying</text>
  <text start="1158.049" dur="8.971">military jets in Syria and it turns out</text>
  <text start="1163.51" dur="9.18">there was an Israeli news story which</text>
  <text start="1167.02" dur="8.58">was falsified that there are no military</text>
  <text start="1172.69" dur="5.07">operations going on in Syria by Russia</text>
  <text start="1175.6" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re bringing in military assets</text>
  <text start="1177.76" dur="4.289">they&amp;#39;re setting up a base but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1179.74" dur="4.77">not actually doing anything but the</text>
  <text start="1182.049" dur="6.061">White House is going along with this</text>
  <text start="1184.51" dur="5.13">saying yes we have proof they are you</text>
  <text start="1188.11" dur="3.33">know going to bomb we don&amp;#39;t know exactly</text>
  <text start="1189.64" dur="5.279">what they&amp;#39;re bombing and this could</text>
  <text start="1191.44" dur="6.78">destabilize Syria well let&amp;#39;s think about</text>
  <text start="1194.919" dur="5.611">this for a second the United States went</text>
  <text start="1198.22" dur="4.8">into a sovereign nation without the</text>
  <text start="1200.53" dur="4.769">permission of the government and with</text>
  <text start="1203.02" dur="8.7">other countries started to bomb inside</text>
  <text start="1205.299" dur="11.25">Syria Assad is inviting Putin into the</text>
  <text start="1211.72" dur="7.92">country to help so who&amp;#39;s to stabilizing</text>
  <text start="1216.549" dur="5.61">the country who has the right to be</text>
  <text start="1219.64" dur="7.08">there not the United States not the</text>
  <text start="1222.159" dur="5.821">coalition forces Putin has the right to</text>
  <text start="1226.72" dur="6.41">be there because he will</text>
  <text start="1227.98" dur="9.169">asked to come in and help so right now</text>
  <text start="1233.13" dur="7.48">the u.s. is backed into a corner</text>
  <text start="1237.149" dur="6.221">Putin is setting up a base with military</text>
  <text start="1240.61" dur="6.659">assets he&amp;#39;s trying to broker a peace</text>
  <text start="1243.37" dur="6.779">deal and this is a huge huge problem for</text>
  <text start="1247.269" dur="5.611">the United States because how can they</text>
  <text start="1250.149" dur="5.311">say no no you can&amp;#39;t go after these</text>
  <text start="1252.88" dur="5.519">terrorists well they don&amp;#39;t want him to</text>
  <text start="1255.46" dur="6.39">because it&amp;#39;s the proxy army so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1258.399" dur="8.76">kind of stuck at this point so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1261.85" dur="7.289">going to do something huge and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1267.159" dur="4.26">already getting some information that</text>
  <text start="1269.139" dur="5.941">they&amp;#39;re my see there might be some type</text>
  <text start="1271.419" dur="5.49">of major chemical attack by the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1275.08" dur="3.599">state now whenever the United States</text>
  <text start="1276.909" dur="4.471">government central bankers are losing a</text>
  <text start="1278.679" dur="5.87">battle or they can&amp;#39;t make gains they</text>
  <text start="1281.38" dur="9.659">always resort to white phosphorus</text>
  <text start="1284.549" dur="8.531">chemical weapons cluster bombs other</text>
  <text start="1291.039" dur="4.77">type of weapons that are kind of banned</text>
  <text start="1293.08" dur="6.03">and we can see already they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="1295.809" dur="5.161">the troops that are already in Iraq to</text>
  <text start="1299.11" dur="3.689">dust off their chemical suits because</text>
  <text start="1300.97" dur="4.829">there could be some type of chemical</text>

  <text start="1305.799" dur="5.97">Islamic state the proxy army for the</text>
  <text start="1308.11" dur="9.96">United States and this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="1311.769" dur="9.681">huge false flag now most likely they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1318.07" dur="6.62">try to push the authorization for war</text>
  <text start="1321.45" dur="5.949">who knows if we&amp;#39;ll gain traction and</text>
  <text start="1324.69" dur="3.88">we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this plays out and</text>
  <text start="1327.399" dur="2.551">we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch this</text>
  <text start="1328.57" dur="4.62">situation very closely because this</text>
  <text start="1329.95" dur="6.42">could just blow up and this could be an</text>
  <text start="1333.19" dur="5.19">all-out war now the central bankers</text>
  <text start="1336.37" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t mind this because they know the</text>
  <text start="1338.38" dur="7.399">system is collapsing and they can blame</text>
  <text start="1340.84" dur="7.38">the collapse on the event that is coming</text>
  <text start="1345.779" dur="4.931">the war that we&amp;#39;re going to be getting</text>
  <text start="1348.22" dur="5.22">into and they can use it as an excuse to</text>
  <text start="1350.71" dur="4.86">create more money and say the economy is</text>
  <text start="1353.44" dur="6.57">not going to recover it&amp;#39;s going to get</text>
  <text start="1355.57" dur="6.03">worse because of the war so we can see</text>
  <text start="1360.01" dur="5.58">where we&amp;#39;re headed at this point</text>
  <text start="1361.6" dur="5.54">as they&amp;#39;re backed into a corner and I</text>
  <text start="1365.59" dur="3.24">know they have tricky ways of</text>
  <text start="1367.14" dur="3.73">manipulating because they really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1368.83" dur="3.87">play by the rules they if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1370.87" dur="5.01">like something they rewrite the laws</text>
  <text start="1372.7" dur="6.3">they do something that they normally a</text>
  <text start="1375.88" dur="4.86">normal person wouldn&amp;#39;t do but eventually</text>
  <text start="1379" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re going to run out of these things</text>
  <text start="1380.74" dur="4.11">and eventually the system will come down</text>
  <text start="1383.26" dur="2.7">without them and they&amp;#39;d rather control</text>
  <text start="1384.85" dur="4.68">it because they don&amp;#39;t want to be blamed</text>
  <text start="1385.96" dur="5.849">for it and we can see their days are</text>

  <text start="1398.86" dur="6.23">come out clawing and biting and they</text>
  <text start="1402.07" dur="7.229">will do something that is horrific and</text>
  <text start="1405.09" dur="7.089">we know it is coming very soon because</text>
