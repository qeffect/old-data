  <text start="139.12" dur="8.47">amazing on paper it looks incredible and</text>
  <text start="143.54" dur="6.419">the central banks they&amp;#39;re nervous now</text>
  <text start="147.59" dur="4.679">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that during</text>
  <text start="149.959" dur="4.051">the time when Bitcoin was rising and</text>
  <text start="152.269" dur="3.631">everything like that Christine Lagarde</text>
  <text start="154.01" dur="4.59">was out there saying oh Bitcoin it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="155.9" dur="5.399">used by terrorists Oh bitcoin is no good</text>
  <text start="158.6" dur="6.78">criminals use it they use it for ransom</text>
  <text start="161.299" dur="6.061">bitcoin is no good and they continually</text>
  <text start="165.38" dur="5.37">push the narrative that cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="167.36" dur="5.97">are very very bad and bad people use</text>
  <text start="170.75" dur="5.34">them and this is how you know it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="173.33" dur="4.05">good thing when Bernanke was out there</text>
  <text start="176.09" dur="3.39">saying that you know gold it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="177.38" dur="4.11">barbarous relic you know we just keep it</text>
  <text start="179.48" dur="5.67">in storage because its historical that</text>
  <text start="181.49" dur="6.35">you know that&amp;#39;s the real money you know</text>
  <text start="185.15" dur="5.91">that whatever they&amp;#39;re saying think</text>
  <text start="187.84" dur="5.17">mirror now it&amp;#39;s very interesting as the</text>
  <text start="191.06" dur="4.05">International Monetary Fund in the World</text>
  <text start="193.01" dur="4.44">Bank they&amp;#39;re launching their own</text>
  <text start="195.11" dur="6.3">blockchain and digital currency to</text>
  <text start="197.45" dur="6.63">familiarize staff with the concepts now</text>
  <text start="201.41" dur="5.1">the currency will only be accessible</text>
  <text start="204.08" dur="4.68">within the organization will not be able</text>
  <text start="206.51" dur="6.23">to buy real-world goods and services</text>
  <text start="208.76" dur="6.63">they&amp;#39;re going to create a mini world and</text>
  <text start="212.74" dur="5.32">they&amp;#39;re going to use it in this mini</text>
  <text start="215.39" dur="5.37">world and they&amp;#39;re gonna try to figure</text>
  <text start="218.06" dur="5.46">out how it actually works it&amp;#39;s called a</text>
  <text start="220.76" dur="6.27">learning coin and they&amp;#39;re gonna use it</text>
  <text start="223.52" dur="5.61">for educational purposes really or are</text>
  <text start="227.03" dur="5.87">they going to use it to try to figure</text>
  <text start="229.13" dur="6.6">out how to take control of another</text>
  <text start="232.9" dur="5.02">cryptocurrency I don&amp;#39;t believe that</text>
  <text start="235.73" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out how it</text>
  <text start="237.92" dur="5.76">works and familiarize their staff on it</text>
  <text start="240.53" dur="5.79">I believe they&amp;#39;re setting up a lab so</text>
  <text start="243.68" dur="5.22">when the time comes and cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="246.32" dur="6.98">are introduced they have the ability to</text>
  <text start="248.9" dur="7.76">take it over because Christine Lagarde</text>
  <text start="253.3" dur="7.18">she said something very interesting that</text>
  <text start="256.66" dur="8.56">cryptocurrencies were clearly shaking</text>
  <text start="260.48" dur="7.02">the system which means crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="265.22" dur="4.77">was shaking their systems that we know</text>
  <text start="267.5" dur="7.53">that trump is out there and he&amp;#39;s pushing</text>
  <text start="269.99" dur="7.92">5g now does everyone need 5g do you need</text>

  <text start="283.43" dur="7.92">we can why in the world would he need 5g</text>
  <text start="287.27" dur="6">well it supports the blockchain and I</text>
  <text start="291.35" dur="4.98">believe this is the direction he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="293.27" dur="5.459">in and I think the central bankers</text>
  <text start="296.33" dur="2.83">they&amp;#39;re starting to realize what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="298.729" dur="1.811">on</text>
  <text start="299.16" dur="3.56">remember they demonized gold they</text>

  <text start="398.58" dur="4.89">economy think about what Trump is done</text>
  <text start="401.19" dur="3.96">in this short period of time I know a</text>
  <text start="403.47" dur="4.08">lot of people think oh my god it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="405.15" dur="5.7">taking forever everything&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="407.55" dur="5.369">the way we want it to go actually how</text>
  <text start="410.85" dur="5.21">long has he been in office two and a</text>
  <text start="412.919" dur="4.681">half years is going on his third year</text>
  <text start="416.06" dur="4.06">that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="417.6" dur="4.98">think about how long the central bank</text>
  <text start="420.12" dur="8.549">how long the deep state has been in</text>
  <text start="422.58" dur="8.93">power he defeated them in two years two</text>
  <text start="428.669" dur="6.801">and a half years where he was able</text>
  <text start="431.51" dur="7.44">to control the narrative of the entire</text>
  <text start="435.47" dur="7.07">economic system think about that for a</text>
  <text start="438.95" dur="9.03">second think about what he accomplished</text>
  <text start="442.54" dur="8.2">he is dictating to the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="447.98" dur="9.09">to the mainstream media to the deep</text>
  <text start="450.74" dur="9.02">state of what he wants and the rest of</text>

  <text start="459.76" dur="7.66">completely exposed it&amp;#39;s he stripped them</text>
  <text start="463.94" dur="8.31">of their protection they are no longer</text>
  <text start="467.42" dur="7.56">protected the deep state is not doing</text>
  <text start="472.25" dur="5.55">their dirty work right now because at</text>
  <text start="474.98" dur="5.51">this point if Trump was not in president</text>
  <text start="477.8" dur="5.25">in the president&amp;#39;s seat we would have a</text>
  <text start="480.49" dur="4.24">major major event that would have</text>
  <text start="483.05" dur="4.2">brought us to war which would cover up</text>
  <text start="484.73" dur="5.82">this entire economic system falling</text>
  <text start="487.25" dur="6.77">apart now remember the central bank</text>
  <text start="490.55" dur="7.17">always wants all eyes off of them and</text>
  <text start="494.02" dur="6.94">there&amp;#39;s no way to fix this system that</text>
  <text start="497.72" dur="6.14">were in the only thing that we can do at</text>
  <text start="500.96" dur="6.81">this point and Trump is doing it is</text>
  <text start="503.86" dur="7.48">rebuild what the central bankers what</text>
  <text start="507.77" dur="5.85">the deep state has stripped us of they</text>
  <text start="511.34" dur="5.639">stripped us of companies they stripped</text>
  <text start="513.62" dur="6.96">us of manufacturing they stripped us of</text>
  <text start="516.979" dur="7.231">sound money they stripped us of the gold</text>
  <text start="520.58" dur="6.75">standard they stripped us of being</text>
  <text start="524.21" dur="8.79">independent and not dependent on the</text>
  <text start="527.33" dur="10.71">government and they enslaved us to their</text>
  <text start="533" dur="6.93">system Trump right now is undoing all of</text>
  <text start="538.04" dur="4.38">this the Fed right now has entered their</text>
  <text start="539.93" dur="5.19">balance sheet reductions they are not</text>
  <text start="542.42" dur="4.31">raising rates most likely they might</text>
  <text start="545.12" dur="5.31">even lower rates</text>
  <text start="546.73" dur="8.02">the ECB they&amp;#39;re holding steady</text>

  <text start="564.86" dur="8.67">they know if the system comes down they</text>
  <text start="568.7" dur="7.53">will be blamed I mean think about what</text>
  <text start="573.53" dur="3.93">is happening right now we have bubbles</text>
