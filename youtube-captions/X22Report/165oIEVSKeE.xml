  <text start="54.14" dur="6.739">FBI and Apple is continuing but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="58.46" dur="5.43">very interesting is a federal judge</text>
  <text start="60.879" dur="5.141">basically handed a crucial win in its</text>

  <text start="81.47" dur="6.84">magistrate judge james Orenstein he</text>
  <text start="85.22" dur="6.6">decided the government lacks the legal</text>

  <text start="91.82" dur="6.089">company to break its own digital</text>
  <text start="94.31" dur="6.18">security protocols and we can see right</text>
  <text start="97.909" dur="7.891">now that apple is on the winning edge of</text>
  <text start="100.49" dur="8.58">this and it seems that the US government</text>
  <text start="105.8" dur="7.08">the FBI the other agencies are going to</text>
  <text start="109.07" dur="10.01">continually push this issue and obama</text>
  <text start="112.88" dur="8.55">did something very interesting obama is</text>
  <text start="119.08" dur="5.44">on the verge right now with permitting</text>
  <text start="121.43" dur="5.91">the National Security Agency to share</text>
  <text start="124.52" dur="4.349">more of the private communications it</text>
  <text start="127.34" dur="3.66">intercepts with other American</text>
  <text start="128.869" dur="6.2">intelligence agencies without first</text>
  <text start="131" dur="7.68">applying any privacy protections to them</text>
  <text start="135.069" dur="6.521">the idea is to let more experts across</text>
  <text start="138.68" dur="6.479">American intelligence gain direct access</text>
  <text start="141.59" dur="4.979">to the information that means more</text>
  <text start="145.159" dur="4.261">officials will be looking at private</text>
  <text start="146.569" dur="6.661">messages not only foreign phone calls</text>
  <text start="149.42" dur="7.97">and emails but also American phone calls</text>
  <text start="153.23" dur="6.86">emails and data the executive branch</text>
  <text start="157.39" dur="5.56">have been developing this new framework</text>
  <text start="160.09" dur="5.08">for years now</text>
  <text start="162.95" dur="5.429">President George W Bush set the change</text>
  <text start="165.17" dur="6">in motion through a little notice line</text>
  <text start="168.379" dur="5.161">in the 2008 executive order and the</text>
  <text start="171.17" dur="5.069">Obama administration has been quietly</text>
  <text start="173.54" dur="5.46">developing this framework for how to</text>
  <text start="176.239" dur="7.591">carry it out since taking office since</text>
  <text start="179" dur="7.14">2009 so when he told us that he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="183.83" dur="5.34">to stop the NSA there&amp;#39;ll be no more</text>
  <text start="186.14" dur="5.55">spying on the American people well again</text>
  <text start="189.17" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s the opposite of what he has been</text>
  <text start="191.69" dur="5.7">telling us basically the government at</text>
  <text start="194.09" dur="5.88">this point doesn&amp;#39;t really care about the</text>
  <text start="197.39" dur="4.29">rights of the people they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="199.97" dur="4.41">whatever they want again they have laws</text>
  <text start="201.68" dur="5.25">that they follow and then they expect</text>
  <text start="204.38" dur="5.28">the people to file to follow different</text>
  <text start="206.93" dur="5.61">laws it&amp;#39;s a double standard right now</text>
  <text start="209.66" dur="6.419">and they want to know what everyone is</text>
  <text start="212.54" dur="7.05">doing they need to spy on every single</text>
  <text start="216.079" dur="6.66">person they need to realize what groups</text>
  <text start="219.59" dur="5.85">are being formed what investment ideas</text>
  <text start="222.739" dur="5.991">are out there what patents are coming up</text>
  <text start="225.44" dur="7.56">they&amp;#39;re using it to blackmail judges</text>
  <text start="228.73" dur="6.789">government employees they&amp;#39;re using this</text>
  <text start="233" dur="3.69">for many different agendas and the</text>
  <text start="235.519" dur="4.111">biggest thing that they&amp;#39;re worried about</text>
  <text start="236.69" dur="7.23">is the American people having weapons</text>
  <text start="239.63" dur="7.59">and they are continually trying to push</text>
  <text start="243.92" dur="4.92">the idea that we need to take away the</text>
  <text start="247.22" dur="5.489">weapons from the people to keep them</text>
  <text start="248.84" dur="5.519">safe from all these crazy mass shooters</text>
  <text start="252.709" dur="3.451">out there well actually I rather have a</text>
  <text start="254.359" dur="4.44">weapon if there is a mass shooter out</text>
  <text start="256.16" dur="4.62">there why would I want to be unarmed it</text>
  <text start="258.799" dur="4.971">makes no sense because we know the</text>
  <text start="260.78" dur="6.06">criminals will always get what they need</text>
  <text start="263.77" dur="5.59">okay during Prohibition guess what all</text>
  <text start="266.84" dur="5.25">the law abiding citizens didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="269.36" dur="5.82">alcohol but guess what on the black</text>
  <text start="272.09" dur="5.97">market you can get alcohol politicians</text>
  <text start="275.18" dur="4.89">were able to get alcohol the only people</text>
  <text start="278.06" dur="5.01">that couldn&amp;#39;t get alcohol where the law</text>
  <text start="280.07" dur="6.48">abiding citizens and this goes the same</text>
  <text start="283.07" dur="6.48">with guns and the reason why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="286.55" dur="4.799">trying to basically disarm the American</text>
  <text start="289.55" dur="4.799">people is because they want a</text>
  <text start="291.349" dur="5.871">controllable population so they put</text>
  <text start="294.349" dur="6.121">forth this legislation which was</text>
  <text start="297.22" dur="8.29">pushed once before where they want to</text>
  <text start="300.47" dur="6.48">have everyone get gun insurance they</text>
  <text start="305.51" dur="4.71">would force gun owners to purchase</text>
  <text start="306.95" dur="5.04">liability insurance and this is being</text>
  <text start="310.22" dur="4.53">pushed in three states right now and the</text>
  <text start="311.99" dur="6.57">city of Los Angeles under the proposal</text>
  <text start="314.75" dur="5.43">the gun owners would face fines up to</text>
  <text start="318.56" dur="4.89">about ten thousand dollars if you didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="320.18" dur="4.83">get liability insurance and the law also</text>
  <text start="323.45" dur="5.57">would require individuals to prove they</text>
  <text start="325.01" dur="6.57">have insurance prior to buying a firearm</text>
  <text start="329.02" dur="6.66">so we see this is happening in New York</text>
  <text start="331.58" dur="7.38">State and they want people to maintain a</text>
  <text start="335.68" dur="5.95">$250,000 liability coverage we see</text>
  <text start="338.96" dur="4.89">Hawaii&amp;#39;s doing the same thing the city</text>
  <text start="341.63" dur="6.75">of Los Angeles is doing it New Hampshire</text>
  <text start="343.85" dur="8.34">is doing it Vermont is doing it and this</text>
  <text start="348.38" dur="8.28">is the same proposal which failed in</text>
  <text start="352.19" dur="6.72">Congress that representative carolyn</text>
  <text start="356.66" dur="4.83">Maloney push forward which was the</text>
  <text start="358.91" dur="5.4">firearm risk protection act now this is</text>
  <text start="361.49" dur="6.96">not going to keep everyone safe because</text>
  <text start="364.31" dur="5.46">you have insurance on your firearm you</text>
  <text start="368.45" dur="6.57">have insurance on your card is that</text>
  <text start="369.77" dur="9.54">really keep you safe no all it does is</text>
  <text start="375.02" dur="6.36">pay out after the action occurred so all</text>
  <text start="379.31" dur="3.96">the law-abiding people will purchase the</text>
  <text start="381.38" dur="3.57">insurance they&amp;#39;ll have it on their</text>
  <text start="383.27" dur="3.84">weapon they won&amp;#39;t be committing the</text>
  <text start="384.95" dur="4.89">crimes and let&amp;#39;s say the criminals who</text>
  <text start="387.11" dur="5.7">don&amp;#39;t abide by the law they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="389.84" dur="5.52">to get insurance it&amp;#39;s meaningless this</text>
  <text start="392.81" dur="4.919">is a way to keep people from purchasing</text>
  <text start="395.36" dur="3.93">weapons and it&amp;#39;s a way to make the</text>
  <text start="397.729" dur="3.261">insurance companies very wealthy because</text>
  <text start="399.29" dur="6.39">you know they&amp;#39;re not going to pay out on</text>
  <text start="400.99" dur="6.22">any of these that that that when</text>
  <text start="405.68" dur="3.66">something is committed with a weapon</text>
  <text start="407.21" dur="3.93">some type of crime they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="409.34" dur="4.62">a little clause in there that says oh no</text>
  <text start="411.14" dur="4.7">we don&amp;#39;t pay out on crimes so what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="413.96" dur="4.68">purpose of the liability insurance and</text>
  <text start="415.84" dur="4.84">you&amp;#39;ll see they&amp;#39;ll have all these</text>
  <text start="418.64" dur="6.83">clauses in there where they don&amp;#39;t pay</text>
  <text start="420.68" dur="7.169">out at all this whole entire scam is</text>
  <text start="425.47" dur="4.75">basically to keep the weapons out of the</text>
  <text start="427.849" dur="4.441">everyday person Pierre</text>
  <text start="430.22" dur="5.13">it it doesn&amp;#39;t keep you safe it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="432.29" dur="6.3">change anything it doesn&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="435.35" dur="6.96">except bring in money to the insurance</text>
  <text start="438.59" dur="6.36">companies they can rat taxes around it</text>
  <text start="442.31" dur="4.71">to bring in revenue and people have to</text>
  <text start="444.95" dur="7.28">make people have to pay more money out</text>
  <text start="447.02" dur="8.55">of their pockets now out in North Korea</text>
  <text start="452.23" dur="5.97">we understand the u.s. is putting a lot</text>
  <text start="455.57" dur="6.24">of pressure on North Korea right now</text>
  <text start="458.2" dur="5.83">because of their testing of this</text>
  <text start="461.81" dur="3.45">non-existent hydrogen bomb they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="464.03" dur="4.92">have any proof there was no radiation</text>
  <text start="465.26" dur="5.55">they couldn&amp;#39;t show any proof that this</text>
  <text start="468.95" dur="3.15">actually happened all there was was an</text>
  <text start="470.81" dur="4.62">earthquake they went with that with the</text>
  <text start="472.1" dur="6.27">propaganda and the United States went</text>
  <text start="475.43" dur="5.76">and placed sanctions on North Korea</text>
  <text start="478.37" dur="5.88">submitted it to the UN and right now the</text>
  <text start="481.19" dur="6.18">United Nations they have proposed they</text>
  <text start="484.25" dur="5.85">have postponed a vote on these new</text>
  <text start="487.37" dur="5.28">sanctions and it was postponed because</text>
  <text start="490.1" dur="4.35">of Russia they requested this to be</text>
  <text start="492.65" dur="3.57">postponed and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="494.45" dur="4.59">going to be looking at this again on</text>
  <text start="496.22" dur="6.81">Wednesday so we&amp;#39;ll have to see what</text>
  <text start="499.04" dur="5.879">happens if the propagation moves forward</text>
  <text start="503.03" dur="4.05">that means the u.s. is continually</text>
  <text start="504.919" dur="4.261">provoking North Korea and more sanctions</text>
  <text start="507.08" dur="5.759">are being placed they want North Korea</text>
  <text start="509.18" dur="7.44">to do something now the Syrian peace</text>
  <text start="512.839" dur="8.671">talks they are postponed until March 9th</text>
  <text start="516.62" dur="5.7">and they will resume in geneva looks</text>
  <text start="521.51" dur="5.48">like they had a little bit of a</text>
  <text start="522.32" dur="7.92">rescheduling of these peace talks we see</text>
  <text start="526.99" dur="6.61">Russia has strengthened the air grouping</text>
  <text start="530.24" dur="9.72">in Syria they brought in more fighters</text>
  <text start="533.6" dur="14.93">for su-35 esas we see 12 su-34 s32 su-24</text>
  <text start="539.96" dur="11.91">s12 su-25 15 mi 812 mi-24s and so on and</text>
  <text start="548.53" dur="5.95">we can see they&amp;#39;re continually bombing</text>
  <text start="551.87" dur="6.27">the Islamic state l news for al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="554.48" dur="7.5">and right now on Feb your 28th the</text>
  <text start="558.14" dur="5.74">Syrian Arab army reopen the supply route</text>
  <text start="561.98" dur="29.02">to Aleppo</text>
  <text start="563.88" dur="29.4">we see on february2014 the syrian army</text>
  <text start="591" dur="4.08">and russia had been pushing back the</text>
  <text start="593.28" dur="3">islamic state and they&amp;#39;ve been pushing</text>
  <text start="595.08" dur="2.73">them out of the country remember they</text>
  <text start="596.28" dur="2.88">are the proxy army for the nicest</text>
  <text start="597.81" dur="3.78">government central bankers the Islamic</text>
  <text start="599.16" dur="5.52">state al Qaeda al-nusrah and the other</text>
  <text start="601.59" dur="7.95">terrorist groups the moderate rebels are</text>
  <text start="604.68" dur="8.55">all intertwined and right now if Russia</text>
  <text start="609.54" dur="6.09">and Syria continue with this there is no</text>
  <text start="613.23" dur="6.48">reason for the coalition forces to be in</text>
  <text start="615.63" dur="6.48">Syria whatsoever now remember the only</text>
  <text start="619.71" dur="3.45">reason the United States is saying that</text>
  <text start="622.11" dur="2.73">they&amp;#39;re in there and the coalition</text>
  <text start="623.16" dur="5.22">forces are in Syria is to fight</text>
  <text start="624.84" dur="5.97">terrorism but if there&amp;#39;s no terrorist</text>
  <text start="628.38" dur="4.2">group left in Syria there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="630.81" dur="3.63">for them to be there remember the</text>
  <text start="632.58" dur="3.96">elected government of Syria did not</text>
  <text start="634.44" dur="5.13">invite them in there there illegally</text>
  <text start="636.54" dur="7.2">they invaded a country yes Russia was</text>
  <text start="639.57" dur="6.45">invited in by the elected government now</text>
  <text start="643.74" dur="4.59">at this point we realized that turkey is</text>
  <text start="646.02" dur="5.13">not abiding by the ceasefire whatsoever</text>
  <text start="648.33" dur="5.43">they don&amp;#39;t care about it their mission</text>
  <text start="651.15" dur="7.14">which is coming from NATO and the u.s.</text>
  <text start="653.76" dur="7.71">is to keep this alive keep the car door</text>
  <text start="658.29" dur="6.39">open we&amp;#39;re seeing Turkish military units</text>
  <text start="661.47" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re continually massing more and</text>
  <text start="664.68" dur="4.41">more troops along the border Milton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="667.38" dur="6.33">right now are pouring across the border</text>
  <text start="669.09" dur="6.18">into Syria in the raka province a group</text>
  <text start="673.71" dur="5.34">of about a hundred fighters crossed into</text>
  <text start="675.27" dur="6">Syria from Turkey 250 strong group was</text>
  <text start="679.05" dur="4.71">supported by artillery fire from the</text>
  <text start="681.27" dur="6.02">Turkish territory that also came into</text>
  <text start="683.76" dur="7.38">Syria and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="687.29" dur="9.56">turkey is not even pausing right now</text>
  <text start="691.14" dur="11.55">they&amp;#39;re continually shelling into Syria</text>
  <text start="696.85" dur="9.03">now this entire ceasefire is a cover</text>
  <text start="702.69" dur="6.339">because what was happening is Russia and</text>
  <text start="705.88" dur="5.55">Syria were completely destroying their</text>
  <text start="709.029" dur="7.261">proxy armies and they were losing ground</text>
  <text start="711.43" dur="7.92">very quickly they needed this pause to</text>
  <text start="716.29" dur="5.039">basically reinforce the force is there</text>
  <text start="719.35" dur="3.75">and to reposition everything and come up</text>
  <text start="721.329" dur="4.051">with a new plan which they&amp;#39;re working on</text>
  <text start="723.1" dur="6.179">right now but this whole entire</text>
  <text start="725.38" dur="5.84">ceasefire is a complete trap because you</text>
  <text start="729.279" dur="4.891">know eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="731.22" dur="7.15">the US and the other Western powers are</text>
  <text start="734.17" dur="7.26">going to accuse Russia Iran Hezbollah</text>
  <text start="738.37" dur="7.23">the Syrian government of breaking the</text>
  <text start="741.43" dur="7.139">ceasefire and they&amp;#39;ll say well they</text>
  <text start="745.6" dur="6.96">broke the ceasefire it&amp;#39;s completely off</text>
  <text start="748.569" dur="6.121">and we&amp;#39;re going in and we can see</text>
  <text start="752.56" dur="4.759">they&amp;#39;re getting prepared for this now</text>
  <text start="754.69" dur="6.12">can they just bring ground troops into</text>
  <text start="757.319" dur="4.811">Syria now this would look kind of</text>
  <text start="760.81" dur="3.66">obvious because why would you need all</text>
  <text start="762.13" dur="5.009">these ground troops because who are they</text>
  <text start="764.47" dur="6.419">really fighting the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="767.139" dur="6.361">almost gone so what would be their</text>
  <text start="770.889" dur="6.45">reasoning so this way this is the reason</text>
  <text start="773.5" dur="5.85">why they need some type of an event they</text>
  <text start="777.339" dur="5.581">need to make their case of why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="779.35" dur="6.03">bringing this in now Russia they want to</text>
  <text start="782.92" dur="5.089">close the Turkish border they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="785.38" dur="6.809">it has to be completely sealed off and</text>
  <text start="788.009" dur="6.041">they want that corridor closed and they</text>
  <text start="792.189" dur="4.801">want to get regain control of the entire</text>
  <text start="794.05" dur="4.38">Syria border which is bordering Turkey</text>
  <text start="796.99" dur="3">right now and they&amp;#39;re going to close it</text>
  <text start="798.43" dur="4.529">on their end and then we keep patrols</text>
  <text start="799.99" dur="6.089">and this is going to pose a problem they</text>
  <text start="802.959" dur="4.68">cannot allow this to happen this is why</text>
  <text start="806.079" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re working on the next plan this is</text>
  <text start="807.639" dur="6.06">why turkey is continually shelling to</text>
  <text start="810.009" dur="6.781">keep this open and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="813.699" dur="6.87">that Russia is also calling for a</text>
  <text start="816.79" dur="6.51">convention on chemical terrorism because</text>
  <text start="820.569" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re saying right now there is no</text>
  <text start="823.3" dur="4.74">existing international law that solves</text>
  <text start="826.329" dur="4.17">the issue of prohibiting the use of</text>
  <text start="828.04" dur="7.739">chemical weapons by non-state</text>
  <text start="830.499" dur="6.69">actors by terrorists and the US</text>
  <text start="835.779" dur="3">government central bankers knew this</text>
  <text start="837.189" dur="4.56">when they created the proxy army the</text>
  <text start="838.779" dur="6.38">Islamic state where they allow them to</text>
  <text start="841.749" dur="8.34">use chemical weapons in Iraq in Syria in</text>
  <text start="845.159" dur="6.82">Yemen because there&amp;#39;s nothing that</text>
  <text start="850.089" dur="3.45">anyone can do because they&amp;#39;re terrorists</text>
  <text start="851.979" dur="5.34">there&amp;#39;s nothing about it in</text>
  <text start="853.539" dur="5.55">international law and this was their</text>
  <text start="857.319" dur="3.99">plan from the beginning now a lot of the</text>
  <text start="859.089" dur="5.06">attacks they were able to say oh no it</text>
  <text start="861.309" dur="6.78">was a sod and they tried to blame him</text>
  <text start="864.149" dur="6.88">now we know that countries at least 49</text>
  <text start="868.089" dur="4.77">of them that we know of got together and</text>
  <text start="871.029" dur="5.1">gathered at NATO headquarters in</text>

  <text start="876.129" dur="5.97">invasion into Syria now you know they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="879.939" dur="5.55">come up with a plan you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="882.099" dur="5.82">getting prepared to do this Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="885.489" dur="6.57">is saying that they will participate and</text>
  <text start="887.919" dur="7.14">they have already admitted that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="892.059" dur="6.69">coalition forces are all in on this</text>
  <text start="895.059" dur="7.5">they&amp;#39;re all ready to do this now we know</text>
  <text start="898.749" dur="5.67">there are special forces in Libya we</text>
  <text start="902.559" dur="4.65">know that the US has it we know Frances</text>
  <text start="904.419" dur="5.58">in there and pretty much there&amp;#39;s other</text>
  <text start="907.209" dur="6.89">countries that are in this area we see</text>
  <text start="909.999" dur="6.721">the US has special op forces in Syria</text>
  <text start="914.099" dur="6.45">right now we&amp;#39;re getting word that delta</text>
  <text start="916.72" dur="6.449">force is being Unleashed into iraq of</text>
  <text start="920.549" dur="4.93">course under the illusion they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="923.169" dur="4.41">after the islamic state now part of</text>
  <text start="925.479" dur="5.76">their mission is to destroy any evidence</text>
  <text start="927.579" dur="5.88">that leads back to her one or two the</text>
  <text start="931.239" dur="4.02">United States or the coalition forces so</text>
  <text start="933.459" dur="4.91">they&amp;#39;re being sent in to destroy</text>
  <text start="935.259" dur="6.54">anything they can get their hands on</text>
  <text start="938.369" dur="5.05">because we see the Iraqi forces just</text>
  <text start="941.799" dur="4.2">like they did in Ramadi without the u.s.</text>
  <text start="943.419" dur="4.44">help they&amp;#39;re going into my school so</text>
  <text start="945.999" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re sending in Delta Force ahead of</text>
  <text start="947.859" dur="7.73">time to get rid of anything that&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="950.589" dur="7.98">there and we see at this point that</text>
  <text start="955.589" dur="5.59">their plan that they have right now is a</text>
  <text start="958.569" dur="5.64">go because remember they have a huge</text>
  <text start="961.179" dur="4.83">military buildup in Iraq they have</text>
  <text start="964.209" dur="5.16">to air bases in the northern part of</text>
  <text start="966.009" dur="6.57">Iraq which borders Syria right now we</text>
  <text start="969.369" dur="6.121">see in Lebanon we&amp;#39;re getting all these</text>
  <text start="972.579" dur="8.88">warnings Kuwait United Arab Emirates</text>
  <text start="975.49" dur="8.069">Saudi Arabia Jordan they&amp;#39;re all pulling</text>
  <text start="981.459" dur="5.82">their diplomats out of Lebanon travel</text>
  <text start="983.559" dur="5.731">advisories are posted and we get this</text>
  <text start="987.279" dur="4.5">little piece of information from the</text>
  <text start="989.29" dur="4.409">Pentagon that the international</text>
  <text start="991.779" dur="6.15">community will support Lebanon&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="993.699" dur="7.38">military should there be an Islamic</text>
  <text start="997.929" dur="7.07">state attack in the country this is</text>
  <text start="1001.079" dur="7.471">coming from a US official in Washington</text>
  <text start="1004.999" dur="7.27">so what does this tell us it tells us</text>
  <text start="1008.55" dur="6.449">their plan is a go they&amp;#39;re getting ready</text>
  <text start="1012.269" dur="5.01">to go into Lebanon they&amp;#39;re getting ready</text>
  <text start="1014.999" dur="4.921">to go into Libya it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1017.279" dur="4.65">going into all the countries where they</text>
  <text start="1019.92" dur="4.95">need to reinforce their puppet</text>
  <text start="1021.929" dur="4.951">governments or remove the elected</text>
  <text start="1024.87" dur="6.299">governments and put back their puppet</text>
  <text start="1026.88" dur="7.169">governments now very interestingly we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1031.169" dur="5.941">getting another warning the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="1034.049" dur="6.561">coming out and saying that US citizens</text>
  <text start="1037.11" dur="8.459">are now cautioned against visiting</text>
  <text start="1040.61" dur="8.47">turkey in the south eastern region now</text>
  <text start="1045.569" dur="5.941">why would this be is a travel warning</text>
  <text start="1049.08" dur="6.329">right now that they shouldn&amp;#39;t even go</text>
  <text start="1051.51" dur="7.409">near that area the reason for this is</text>
  <text start="1055.409" dur="5.671">because they&amp;#39;re getting ready for a</text>
  <text start="1058.919" dur="3.841">major offensive it&amp;#39;s strange that</text>
  <text start="1061.08" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re giving a warning during a</text>
  <text start="1062.76" dur="6.889">ceasefire because this warning really</text>
  <text start="1066.27" dur="6.899">didn&amp;#39;t come out anytime before this</text>
  <text start="1069.649" dur="7.481">which is kind of odd since there was a</text>
  <text start="1073.169" dur="6.451">full-blown war going on and Russia was</text>
  <text start="1077.13" dur="6.81">in their bombing but now we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="1079.62" dur="7.89">it during a peaceful period which tells</text>
  <text start="1083.94" dur="8.03">us that something is coming so we see</text>
  <text start="1087.51" dur="7.35">already all these pieces are in motion</text>
  <text start="1091.97" dur="5.71">the charles de gaulle aircraft carrier</text>
  <text start="1094.86" dur="6.3">with egypt heading towards the Med</text>
  <text start="1097.68" dur="6.06">iranian for Libya Lebanon travel warning</text>
  <text start="1101.16" dur="4.41">us official said yes we will go back</text>
  <text start="1103.74" dur="6.12">into Lebanon if the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1105.57" dur="6.87">attacks libya right now Special Ops</text>
  <text start="1109.86" dur="5.1">teams already in there we know that</text>
  <text start="1112.44" dur="5.27">France is getting ready with the</text>
  <text start="1114.96" dur="8.07">coalition forces to go back into Libya</text>
  <text start="1117.71" dur="9.73">we see in Iraq military buildup Delta</text>
  <text start="1123.03" dur="7.77">Force going into Iraq we see already the</text>
  <text start="1127.44" dur="4.89">travel warning in Turkey the US has</text>
  <text start="1130.8" dur="5.61">infinia swore ships in the Mediterranean</text>
  <text start="1132.33" dur="6.06">the USS Harry Truman all the pieces are</text>
  <text start="1136.41" dur="5.58">coming together they&amp;#39;re getting ready</text>
  <text start="1138.39" dur="5.46">for this major offensive they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1141.99" dur="4.8">to get everything ready to go we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1143.85" dur="5.73">waiting for the green light and if this</text>
  <text start="1146.79" dur="4.92">report holds true it looks like the go</text>
  <text start="1149.58" dur="4.94">time will be between April and May and</text>
  <text start="1151.71" dur="6.81">this is what we&amp;#39;ll be looking at now is</text>
  <text start="1154.52" dur="7.51">their plan always perfect does it always</text>
  <text start="1158.52" dur="5.4">work out we might see this build-up we</text>
  <text start="1162.03" dur="4.76">might see some type of an event to get</text>
  <text start="1163.92" dur="4.98">things started but it might fall apart</text>
  <text start="1166.79" dur="3.79">this is something that we have to look</text>
  <text start="1168.9" dur="4.92">at but all the indicators at this point</text>
  <text start="1170.58" dur="6.17">it is definitely pointing to this time</text>
  <text start="1173.82" dur="6.06">frame and to what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="1176.75" dur="5.92">because remember the economy is</text>
  <text start="1179.88" dur="5.67">continually collapsing there&amp;#39;s no way to</text>
  <text start="1182.67" dur="5.04">save it yes they can manipulate it they</text>
  <text start="1185.55" dur="3.81">can put it off but eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1187.71" dur="4.29">going to happen is the entire system is</text>
  <text start="1189.36" dur="5.73">going to come down and they have two</text>
  <text start="1192" dur="5.04">choices one they let it just collapse on</text>
  <text start="1195.09" dur="3.69">its own everyone blames the US</text>
  <text start="1197.04" dur="5.37">government everyone blames the central</text>
  <text start="1198.78" dur="6.42">bankers and the people demand we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1202.41" dur="4.59">do this again we need them replaced no</text>
  <text start="1205.2" dur="4.29">more central bank now we know they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1207" dur="5.76">want this to happen second alternative</text>
  <text start="1209.49" dur="7.65">start a war take all eyes off of them</text>
  <text start="1212.76" dur="7.11">place it somewhere else tell people they</text>
  <text start="1217.14" dur="6.98">need to go fight because another country</text>
  <text start="1219.87" dur="8.13">another group destroyed our economy and</text>
  <text start="1224.12" dur="6.82">this will save them because we know for</text>
  <text start="1228" dur="3.48">a fact they will try to restart the</text>
  <text start="1230.94" dur="3.21">entire</text>
  <text start="1231.48" dur="6.06">system so what are we looking for at</text>
  <text start="1234.15" dur="5.67">this point we&amp;#39;re looking for events now</text>
  <text start="1237.54" dur="4.95">when I say events these are false flags</text>
  <text start="1239.82" dur="5.34">where they try to pin it on someone they</text>
  <text start="1242.49" dur="3.99">create them and say oh they did it now</text>
  <text start="1245.16" dur="3.57">the event could be in the United States</text>
  <text start="1246.48" dur="6.54">it could be in Europe or it could be in</text>
  <text start="1248.73" dur="6.18">the Middle East someplace but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1253.02" dur="3.99">looking to see where this happens now if</text>
  <text start="1254.91" dur="6.68">it&amp;#39;s in the Middle East and they have</text>
  <text start="1257.01" dur="4.58">this event the call of the ceasefire</text>
  <text start="1261.71" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re not ready to bring down the</text>
  <text start="1265.29" dur="5.28">economy all they&amp;#39;re doing right now is</text>
  <text start="1268.1" dur="3.55">retrying to reestablish the puppet</text>
  <text start="1270.57" dur="3.65">governments throughout the Middle East</text>
  <text start="1271.65" dur="8.31">and they&amp;#39;re making a push to take Syria</text>
  <text start="1274.22" dur="7.84">if this is going poorly and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1279.96" dur="5.52">getting traction and they&amp;#39;re not getting</text>
  <text start="1282.06" dur="5.85">anywhere with this and Russia and Syria</text>
  <text start="1285.48" dur="6.09">are winning the people in these</text>
  <text start="1287.91" dur="6.57">countries are winning we will then see</text>
  <text start="1291.57" dur="6.3">them move to their second event which</text>
  <text start="1294.48" dur="6.84">would be in the united states in europe</text>
  <text start="1297.87" dur="6.95">and canada austria all at once to get</text>
  <text start="1301.32" dur="8.4">everyone into war before this entire</text>
