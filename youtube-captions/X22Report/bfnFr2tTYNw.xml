  <text start="33.84" dur="4.71">report my name is dave and this is</text>
  <text start="35.25" dur="5.88">episode 1090 and today&amp;#39;s date is october</text>
  <text start="38.55" dur="4.98">second 2016 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="41.13" dur="4.98">episode is the current economic collapse</text>
  <text start="43.53" dur="5.22">news brief let&amp;#39;s get right into the</text>
  <text start="46.11" dur="6.92">economic collapse news now as we can see</text>
  <text start="48.75" dur="7.35">the situation regarding Deutsche Bank is</text>
  <text start="53.03" dur="5.05">getting worse and worse day by day and</text>
  <text start="56.1" dur="4.07">there were rumors that were floating</text>
  <text start="58.08" dur="8.1">around that the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="60.17" dur="8.47">was going to reduce its fine on the rmbs</text>
  <text start="66.18" dur="7.5">settlement with Deutsche Bank from 14</text>
  <text start="68.64" dur="6.75">billion to 6 billion and this is why all</text>
  <text start="73.68" dur="3.51">of a sudden everyone said okay the</text>
  <text start="75.39" dur="4.68">problem with Deutsche Bank is fixed</text>
  <text start="77.19" dur="7.41">everything is fine but we come to find</text>
  <text start="80.07" dur="8.579">out that the information coming from the</text>
  <text start="84.6" dur="6.78">source AFP which was relying on Twitter</text>
  <text start="88.649" dur="5.071">for that information it turned out it</text>
  <text start="91.38" dur="7.4">was completely bogus and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="93.72" dur="9.12">seeing right now is that those meetings</text>
  <text start="98.78" dur="6.31">haven&amp;#39;t even been held yet because what</text>
  <text start="102.84" dur="3.87">we&amp;#39;ve learned is that deutsche bank</text>
  <text start="105.09" dur="4.23">executives they&amp;#39;re heading to the united</text>
  <text start="106.71" dur="4.56">states in the coming days to negotiate</text>
  <text start="109.32" dur="7.979">the 14 billion dollar settlement over</text>
  <text start="111.27" dur="8.19">fine for mis-selling the rmbs so in</text>
  <text start="117.299" dur="4.411">other words not only was the five point</text>
  <text start="119.46" dur="4.47">six billion agreed-upon number as</text>
  <text start="121.71" dur="4.89">reported by twitter and then AFP bogus</text>
  <text start="123.93" dur="6.9">but the actual negotiations haven&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="126.6" dur="7.919">started so it looks like Deutsche Bank</text>
  <text start="130.83" dur="5.1">is still in big trouble and to add to</text>
  <text start="134.519" dur="5.641">everything that&amp;#39;s going on with Deutsche</text>
  <text start="135.93" dur="6.57">Bank we have Italy where we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="140.16" dur="3.87">reports coming out that six current and</text>
  <text start="142.5" dur="3.48">former managers of Deutsche Bank were</text>
  <text start="144.03" dur="3.9">charged in Milan for colluding to</text>
  <text start="145.98" dur="5.49">falsify the accounts of Italy&amp;#39;s third</text>
  <text start="147.93" dur="4.95">biggest bank Monte Paschi and a judge</text>
  <text start="151.47" dur="4.56">approved a request by Milan Prosecutor&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="152.88" dur="5.13">to try the bankers on charges involving</text>
  <text start="156.03" dur="5.03">two separate derivative transactions</text>
  <text start="158.01" dur="5.58">arranged with Nomura and Deutsche Bank</text>
  <text start="161.06" dur="2.94">Monte Paschi arranged the transaction to</text>
  <text start="163.59" dur="2.33">hide</text>
  <text start="164" dur="3.93">millions in losses that led to false</text>
  <text start="165.92" dur="5.7">accounting between two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="167.93" dur="8.39">and twenty twelve and we can see right</text>
  <text start="171.62" dur="8.089">now many of these banks they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="176.32" dur="7.54">reported on for money laundering for</text>
  <text start="179.709" dur="8.351">opening up fake accounts for colluding</text>
  <text start="183.86" dur="6.84">and we can see right now this entire</text>
  <text start="188.06" dur="7.35">baking system is a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="190.7" dur="6.71">it&amp;#39;s run by criminals and yet remember</text>
  <text start="195.41" dur="6.39">deutsche bank isn&amp;#39;t just too big to fail</text>
  <text start="197.41" dur="7.87">it&amp;#39;s way too big to be allowed to fail</text>
  <text start="201.8" dur="7.14">and that&amp;#39;s the problem because when this</text>
  <text start="205.28" dur="5.04">bank comes down it has links to many</text>
  <text start="208.94" dur="4.62">other banks through the derivative</text>
  <text start="210.32" dur="4.86">market and through other financial</text>
  <text start="213.56" dur="4.59">accounting and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="215.18" dur="5.22">now is if this bank goes it will start a</text>
  <text start="218.15" dur="6.3">domino effect and it will hit other</text>
  <text start="220.4" dur="6.059">banks so the government and financial</text>
  <text start="224.45" dur="4.95">authorities well they&amp;#39;re preparing a</text>
  <text start="226.459" dur="6.151">rescue plan even though we heard germany</text>
  <text start="229.4" dur="4.68">and all the other government pundants</text>
  <text start="232.61" dur="3.39">out there saying that you know we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="234.08" dur="4.95">going to do anything we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="236" dur="6.06">bail them out and you know behind locked</text>
  <text start="239.03" dur="5.16">doors in the shadows of government in</text>
  <text start="242.06" dur="3.929">the shadows of the central bank you know</text>
  <text start="244.19" dur="4.65">they are working on a plan look what</text>
  <text start="245.989" dur="4.921">happened in 2008 with Bear Stearns we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="248.84" dur="4.14">behind the scenes they are working on</text>
  <text start="250.91" dur="4.98">plans to save Bear Stearns and they</text>
  <text start="252.98" dur="7.11">always have to sacrifice another bank or</text>
  <text start="255.89" dur="6.24">another institution to save one of the</text>
  <text start="260.09" dur="3.12">banks or one of the financial</text>
  <text start="262.13" dur="2.94">institutions and this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="263.21" dur="4.53">happening right now they know if</text>
  <text start="265.07" dur="4.98">Deutsche Bank goes this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="267.74" dur="5.1">complete disaster so you know right now</text>
  <text start="270.05" dur="4.95">they are scrambling to do whatever they</text>
  <text start="272.84" dur="5.13">possibly can now we have to think about</text>
  <text start="275" dur="6.6">this for a second because there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="277.97" dur="5.28">of pieces to this puzzle because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="281.6" dur="3.96">heading into an economic collapse and we</text>
  <text start="283.25" dur="5.34">know that this system cannot survive</text>
  <text start="285.56" dur="5.37">much longer and the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="288.59" dur="4.5">governments around the world they</text>
  <text start="290.93" dur="3.21">understand that this system is coming</text>
  <text start="293.09" dur="2.82">down they know they only have a certain</text>
  <text start="294.14" dur="3.38">amount of time and the US government</text>
  <text start="295.91" dur="5.06">central bankers real</text>
  <text start="297.52" dur="7.47">is that any little hiccup this house of</text>
  <text start="300.97" dur="5.52">cards is coming crashing down so we can</text>
  <text start="304.99" dur="3.6">see we have problems in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="306.49" dur="5.34">we have problems with Deutsche Bank we</text>
  <text start="308.59" dur="6.479">have problems with Saudi Arabia we have</text>
  <text start="311.83" dur="5.75">elections coming up all of this shit&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="315.069" dur="5.461">in together the petro dollar is doomed</text>
  <text start="317.58" dur="4.649">so we can see right now they realize</text>
  <text start="320.53" dur="4.319">that we&amp;#39;re heading to a point in time</text>
  <text start="322.229" dur="5.65">where they&amp;#39;re gonna be no longer be able</text>
  <text start="324.849" dur="3.931">to keep this system operating and we</text>
  <text start="327.879" dur="4.861">know they want to bring it down</text>
  <text start="328.78" dur="5.58">themselves to create a story and it</text>
  <text start="332.74" dur="3.269">looks like they&amp;#39;re just putting band-aid</text>
  <text start="334.36" dur="3.57">fixes on it right now just trying to</text>
  <text start="336.009" dur="5.101">hold it together because it is rapidly</text>
  <text start="337.93" dur="6.6">falling apart and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="341.11" dur="6.089">that we should expect something to occur</text>
  <text start="344.53" dur="4.379">most likely maybe in October we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="347.199" dur="4.02">even know right now because things are</text>
  <text start="348.909" dur="5.461">happening so quickly even if they tell</text>
  <text start="351.219" dur="5.01">us that Deutsche Bank is contained we</text>
  <text start="354.37" dur="5.009">know for a fact whenever they come out</text>
  <text start="356.229" dur="6.12">with those words contained we know we</text>
  <text start="359.379" dur="4.44">are in big trouble because it would</text>
  <text start="362.349" dur="4.081">happen in 2008 they told us everything</text>
  <text start="363.819" dur="6.63">was contained and the whole entire</text>
  <text start="366.43" dur="7.62">system fell apart we see the Chinese you</text>
  <text start="370.449" dur="6.15">one right now well it was just</text>
  <text start="374.05" dur="4.109">introduced into the basket of SD ours</text>
  <text start="376.599" dur="5.22">this is the first new addition since</text>
  <text start="378.159" dur="6.151">1999 and we see right now the decision</text>
  <text start="381.819" dur="4.171">means that chinese yuan will now be used</text>
  <text start="384.31" dur="4.079">as one of the International Monetary</text>
  <text start="385.99" dur="5.28">Fund&amp;#39;s lending currencies and times of</text>
  <text start="388.389" dur="5.52">emergency economic bailouts the move is</text>
  <text start="391.27" dur="4.199">also evidence of China&amp;#39;s growing role as</text>
  <text start="393.909" dur="3.63">a power to challenge the global economic</text>
  <text start="395.469" dur="3.871">dominance of the United States now if we</text>
  <text start="397.539" dur="4.56">look at the may look up if we look at</text>
  <text start="399.34" dur="5.069">the makeup of the STRs we see the yuan</text>
  <text start="402.099" dur="5.461">will have about almost eleven percent in</text>
  <text start="404.409" dur="4.771">weight in the basket and we can see</text>
  <text start="407.56" dur="4.139">right now the United States still has</text>
  <text start="409.18" dur="4.889">about 40 one percent we see the euro has</text>
  <text start="411.699" dur="4.411">about thirty percent then we have the</text>
  <text start="414.069" dur="4.47">yen at eight and then the British Pound</text>
  <text start="416.11" dur="4.41">around eight percent also but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="418.539" dur="5.761">seeing right now is the euro and the</text>
  <text start="420.52" dur="6.389">dollar we see these two currencies right</text>
  <text start="424.3" dur="6.149">now well they&amp;#39;re under threat and we</text>
  <text start="426.909" dur="4.62">have to realize how things occur many</text>
  <text start="430.449" dur="3.54">many reports</text>
  <text start="431.529" dur="5.97">we talked about the Chinese you want</text>
  <text start="433.989" dur="5.07">being included in the SDR and of course</text>
  <text start="437.499" dur="2.94">many people are saying this is</text>
  <text start="439.059" dur="3.45">ridiculous it&amp;#39;s never going to be doing</text>
  <text start="440.439" dur="5.37">this will never happen and here we are</text>
  <text start="442.509" dur="6.69">today you know 22 years later a year</text>
  <text start="445.809" dur="6.36">later the one is included in the basket</text>
  <text start="449.199" dur="7.77">of SDRs because what we&amp;#39;re seeing is the</text>
  <text start="452.169" dur="6.57">changeover is happening very slowly it</text>
  <text start="456.969" dur="3.27">doesn&amp;#39;t happen by snapping your fingers</text>
  <text start="458.739" dur="5.88">and everything just gets changed a</text>
  <text start="460.239" dur="6.87">collapse yes that occurs by snapping</text>
  <text start="464.619" dur="4.56">your finger everything falls down boom</text>
  <text start="467.109" dur="5.1">everything is done in a split second</text>
  <text start="469.179" dur="6.63">that&amp;#39;s how fast collapse occur but what</text>
  <text start="472.209" dur="5.31">we see it takes time for a new system to</text>
  <text start="475.809" dur="4.41">be developed a new system to be</text>
  <text start="477.519" dur="6.9">introduced and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="480.219" dur="7.89">right now a new system to take over for</text>
  <text start="484.419" dur="6">the dollar now what&amp;#39;s the next currency</text>
  <text start="488.109" dur="4.14">going to be we don&amp;#39;t know yet many</text>
  <text start="490.419" dur="4.92">people say the SDR some people say</text>
  <text start="492.249" dur="5.52">crypto so we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch</text>
  <text start="495.339" dur="5.19">and see but we can see from all the</text>
  <text start="497.769" dur="5.76">economic indicators we are moving slowly</text>
  <text start="500.529" dur="6.45">in that direction and what happens it</text>
  <text start="503.529" dur="5.85">starts out very slowly but then all of a</text>
  <text start="506.979" dur="4.53">sudden it starts to ramp up things are</text>
  <text start="509.379" dur="5.28">already set I mean if you look at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="511.509" dur="5.731">happening over the last three years or</text>
  <text start="514.659" dur="4.65">so Russia and China set up their own</text>
  <text start="517.24" dur="5.399">payment system we see they have a</text>
  <text start="519.309" dur="5.551">physical gold market in China we can see</text>
  <text start="522.639" dur="6.87">everything is moving from west to east</text>
  <text start="524.86" dur="7.14">so things are moving very rapidly we</text>
  <text start="529.509" dur="5.76">understand Obamacare well this thing is</text>
  <text start="532" dur="5.61">a complete disaster and this might have</text>
  <text start="535.269" dur="7.981">been planned from the beginning to go to</text>
  <text start="537.61" dur="8.76">a fully socialized one payment type of</text>
  <text start="543.25" dur="7.11">insurance but we see right now the Obama</text>
  <text start="546.37" dur="7.29">administration is maneuvering to pay</text>
  <text start="550.36" dur="4.829">health insurers billions of dollars that</text>
  <text start="553.66" dur="3.359">the government owes under the Affordable</text>
  <text start="555.189" dur="4.5">Care Act through a move that could</text>
  <text start="557.019" dur="4.771">circumvent Congress it&amp;#39;s a bailout</text>
  <text start="559.689" dur="3.661">because we know a lot of these insurance</text>
  <text start="561.79" dur="3.45">companies are saying listen we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="563.35" dur="2.23">making any money we thought this thing</text>
  <text start="565.24" dur="2.68">was</text>
  <text start="565.58" dur="3.78">to be fantastic we wrote the bill we put</text>
  <text start="567.92" dur="3.33">a penalty on those people who didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="569.36" dur="4.08">want to get involved in this insurance</text>
  <text start="571.25" dur="3.84">we raise the premiums and we&amp;#39;re supposed</text>
  <text start="573.44" dur="5.22">to have hundreds of millions of people</text>
  <text start="575.09" dur="5.85">in this system where are they looks like</text>
  <text start="578.66" dur="3.99">everyone&amp;#39;s not cooperating well when the</text>
  <text start="580.94" dur="2.94">economy is collapsing and people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="582.65" dur="3.21">have money and you keep raising the</text>
  <text start="583.88" dur="5.75">insurance premiums not giving the people</text>
  <text start="585.86" dur="8.64">a benefit why would people join this</text>
  <text start="589.63" dur="8.32">they&amp;#39;re not going to so once again the</text>
  <text start="594.5" dur="7.56">government they decided to create this</text>
  <text start="597.95" dur="6.39">system and they accepted a bill from the</text>
  <text start="602.06" dur="4.41">insurance companies they penalize the</text>
  <text start="604.34" dur="5.07">people they gave them no benefit and</text>
  <text start="606.47" dur="5.13">then the insurance companies still get a</text>
  <text start="609.41" dur="4.2">bailout while the people are sitting on</text>
  <text start="611.6" dur="5.85">the sidelines going what do we get from</text>
  <text start="613.61" dur="7.8">this nothing penalties no insurance no</text>
  <text start="617.45" dur="9.6">benefit nothing so once again the people</text>
  <text start="621.41" dur="7.89">lose out now the payments most likely</text>
  <text start="627.05" dur="4.65">will would be drawn from an obscure</text>
  <text start="629.3" dur="5.22">Treasury Department of fun and intended</text>
  <text start="631.7" dur="4.86">to cover a federal legal claims this</text>
  <text start="634.52" dur="3.78">approach would get around a recent</text>
  <text start="636.56" dur="3.87">congressional ban on the use of health</text>
  <text start="638.3" dur="4.14">and human services money to pay the</text>
  <text start="640.43" dur="4.16">insurer&amp;#39;s so we can see already the</text>
  <text start="642.44" dur="6.06">Obama administration is looking to get</text>
  <text start="644.59" dur="7.59">go around Congress and just pay the</text>
  <text start="648.5" dur="7.98">insurance companies we see the internet</text>
  <text start="652.18" dur="6.31">well it looks like everything has gone</text>
  <text start="656.48" dur="5.76">from the United States and has been</text>
  <text start="658.49" dur="5.97">handed over to the UN we know there was</text>
  <text start="662.24" dur="5.13">a judge with about four states in</text>
  <text start="664.46" dur="7.29">Arizona Oklahoma navona in Texas they</text>
  <text start="667.37" dur="7.8">were suing trying to stop this and this</text>
  <text start="671.75" dur="6.18">lawsuit was filed in Texas and the</text>
  <text start="675.17" dur="4.74">federal court in Texas alleged that the</text>
  <text start="677.93" dur="4.11">transition in the absence of</text>
  <text start="679.91" dur="4.26">congressional approval amounts to an</text>
  <text start="682.04" dur="4.98">illegal forfeiture of US government</text>
  <text start="684.17" dur="5.64">property the lawsuit also expressed</text>
  <text start="687.02" dur="4.92">concern that the reorganized icon would</text>
  <text start="689.81" dur="4.95">be so unchecked that it could</text>
  <text start="691.94" dur="7.38">effectively enable or prohibit speech on</text>
  <text start="694.76" dur="7.71">the internet well the transfer</text>
  <text start="699.32" dur="6.75">has been completed and we can see right</text>
  <text start="702.47" dur="6.69">now the United States lost control of</text>
  <text start="706.07" dur="7.5">the internet it is now moved to the UN</text>
  <text start="709.16" dur="6.93">and we talked about a one-world</text>
  <text start="713.57" dur="8.03">government and this is one of the pieces</text>
  <text start="716.09" dur="10.56">to the puzzle and if for some reason</text>
  <text start="721.6" dur="6.46">Obama gets the TPP the TTIP through and</text>
  <text start="726.65" dur="4.65">all the other countries sign off on it</text>
  <text start="728.06" dur="6.06">that is the other piece to a one-world</text>
  <text start="731.3" dur="5.04">government which we discussed but we can</text>
  <text start="734.12" dur="4.86">see right now they only have part of the</text>
  <text start="736.34" dur="5.52">piece but this is a huge threat to those</text>
  <text start="738.98" dur="5.31">individuals that want to speak freely on</text>
  <text start="741.86" dur="4.68">the internet and I would not be</text>
  <text start="744.29" dur="5.97">surprised over the next couple of months</text>
  <text start="746.54" dur="5.82">a year or so that we see many strange</text>
  <text start="750.26" dur="6.33">things occurring on the internet like</text>
  <text start="752.36" dur="6.03">logons like tracking like sorry you</text>
  <text start="756.59" dur="5.73">cannot go to this website it has been</text>
  <text start="758.39" dur="7.52">censored by the UN for hate or other</text>
  <text start="762.32" dur="7.88">type of reasons and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="765.91" dur="8.2">eventually we will see a systemic</text>
  <text start="770.2" dur="5.32">shutdown of many different sites or</text>
  <text start="774.11" dur="5.69">these sites won&amp;#39;t be shut down they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="775.52" dur="7.23">just be blocked so we see right now that</text>
  <text start="779.8" dur="7.45">the situation is becoming worse and</text>
  <text start="782.75" dur="7.53">worse day by day we see that there is a</text>
  <text start="787.25" dur="6.63">lawsuit now against Saudi Arabia since</text>
  <text start="790.28" dur="6.66">that new bill passed we see on Friday</text>
  <text start="793.88" dur="4.76">September 30th a woman whittled when her</text>
  <text start="796.94" dur="4.95">husband was killed at the Pentagon on</text>

  <text start="809.26" dur="6.96">Congress rejected the veto and the</text>
  <text start="814.01" dur="4.56">person suing is Stephanie Ross DeSimone</text>

  <text start="818.57" dur="7.65">support to al-qaeda its leader Osama bin</text>
  <text start="822.71" dur="8.19">Laden and of course we know what this is</text>
  <text start="826.22" dur="6.39">all about we understand that Saudi</text>
  <text start="830.9" dur="2.22">Arabia if they really wanted to bring</text>
  <text start="832.61" dur="2.16">down</text>
  <text start="833.12" dur="4.23">united states they wouldn&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="834.77" dur="5.19">destroy the world trade center we know</text>
  <text start="837.35" dur="5.64">the backstory to all of this we know it</text>
  <text start="839.96" dur="6.5">wasn&amp;#39;t sure there was terror insurance</text>
  <text start="842.99" dur="5.88">on the towers we know the towers were</text>
  <text start="846.46" dur="5.29">full of asbestos and would have cost</text>
  <text start="848.87" dur="5.67">billions of dollars to remove it we know</text>
  <text start="851.75" dur="6.36">it was an inside job we know other</text>
  <text start="854.54" dur="7.38">countries were involved and we can see</text>
  <text start="858.11" dur="7.169">that as saudi arabia is sued by more and</text>
  <text start="861.92" dur="6.21">more individuals saudi arabia has</text>
  <text start="865.279" dur="4.471">threatened to sell assets but also we</text>
  <text start="868.13" dur="3.66">can see saudi arabia might be moving</text>
  <text start="869.75" dur="5.25">away from the united states and this</text>
  <text start="871.79" dur="6.27">might push saudi arabia into russia and</text>
  <text start="875" dur="5.64">china in that direction because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="878.06" dur="3.96">seeing a lot of countries they&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="880.64" dur="4.23">away from the United States at this</text>
  <text start="882.02" dur="5.52">point and this most likely will push</text>
  <text start="884.87" dur="5.15">Saudi Arabia away and then they&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="887.54" dur="6.11">no problems selling the US assets</text>
  <text start="890.02" dur="7.18">selling Treasury bonds and other things</text>
  <text start="893.65" dur="7.629">IRDA Juan is out there and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="897.2" dur="7.77">that the EU needs to make turkey a full</text>
  <text start="901.279" dur="7.891">member and he says this is the end game</text>
  <text start="904.97" dur="6.75">we need visa-free travel for Turks into</text>
  <text start="909.17" dur="6.57">the Schengen area he he says we need it</text>
  <text start="911.72" dur="7.47">this month why is that because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="915.74" dur="5.91">looking to have war coming up soon so</text>
  <text start="919.19" dur="5.399">his people can move freely from country</text>
  <text start="921.65" dur="5.97">to country to escape what is about to</text>
  <text start="924.589" dur="6.361">happen we see the Turkish Parliament</text>
  <text start="927.62" dur="7.43">they extended their mandate allowing the</text>
  <text start="930.95" dur="7.35">army 13 more months in Syria and Iraq</text>
  <text start="935.05" dur="4.69">this is not ending anytime soon because</text>
  <text start="938.3" dur="4.74">we know the United States government</text>
  <text start="939.74" dur="4.83">central bankers they have not gotten</text>
  <text start="943.04" dur="3.66">what they wanted they haven&amp;#39;t reached</text>
  <text start="944.57" dur="5.55">their goal their goal get rid of Assad</text>
  <text start="946.7" dur="6.09">and we can see right now that this has</text>
  <text start="950.12" dur="7.23">always been planned from the beginning</text>
  <text start="952.79" dur="6.239">it has never changed and we can see</text>
  <text start="957.35" dur="3.6">right now the United States government</text>
  <text start="959.029" dur="5.451">central bankers they&amp;#39;re using a lot of</text>
  <text start="960.95" dur="6.04">propaganda because they&amp;#39;re losing their</text>
  <text start="964.48" dur="4.28">edge in Aleppo</text>
  <text start="966.99" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re terrorists force the paid</text>
  <text start="968.76" dur="5.519">mercenaries they&amp;#39;re losing that area to</text>
  <text start="972.12" dur="4.469">Russia and Syria and we&amp;#39;re hearing a lot</text>
  <text start="974.279" dur="3.691">of propaganda how its barbaric how</text>
  <text start="976.589" dur="3.091">they&amp;#39;re killing millions of people</text>
  <text start="977.97" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re going to be throwing so much</text>
  <text start="979.68" dur="4.65">propaganda added to demonize Russia</text>
  <text start="982.35" dur="3.51">because we could see right now Russia</text>
  <text start="984.33" dur="3.48">and the US they&amp;#39;re heading in two</text>
  <text start="985.86" dur="5.4">different directions Russia can&amp;#39;t trust</text>
  <text start="987.81" dur="6.45">the US the u.s. realizes that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="991.26" dur="6.03">lost Syria which is very scary at this</text>
  <text start="994.26" dur="6.21">point because we know that when a wild</text>
  <text start="997.29" dur="5.75">animal is backed into a corner they come</text>
  <text start="1000.47" dur="6.179">out with their claws and we can expect</text>
  <text start="1003.04" dur="5.98">something huge coming out of the United</text>
  <text start="1006.649" dur="7.171">States remember there was a tactical</text>
  <text start="1009.02" dur="8.79">nuke moved from turkey into Syria we</text>
  <text start="1013.82" dur="7.47">also realize that we had this coup</text>
  <text start="1017.81" dur="7.83">d&amp;#39;etat which one bad in Turkey and there</text>
  <text start="1021.29" dur="7.71">were rumors about nuclear weapons being</text>
  <text start="1025.64" dur="5.91">moved from Incirlik Air Base so the</text>
  <text start="1029" dur="5.52">situation right now looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1031.55" dur="6.18">getting prepared to do something in this</text>
  <text start="1034.52" dur="5.309">area because we know that there they</text>
  <text start="1037.73" dur="5.37">want a safe zone we know they want a</text>
  <text start="1039.829" dur="7.171">no-fly zone the problem is it&amp;#39;s Russia</text>
  <text start="1043.1" dur="4.979">and if they try to do anything they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1047" dur="2.429">going to start World War three now</text>
  <text start="1048.079" dur="4.141">they&amp;#39;re not just going to come out and</text>
  <text start="1049.429" dur="4.921">attack Russia because the United States</text>
  <text start="1052.22" dur="4.29">would look like the aggressor look what</text>
  <text start="1054.35" dur="4.74">happened when they hit the Syrian army</text>
  <text start="1056.51" dur="5.43">it blew up in their face and they had to</text>
  <text start="1059.09" dur="5.19">have a wag the dog moment by having</text>
  <text start="1061.94" dur="4.68">those bombings to distract everyone so</text>
  <text start="1064.28" dur="4.47">they just can&amp;#39;t come out and say okay we</text>
  <text start="1066.62" dur="7.02">attack Russia we&amp;#39;re in war they have to</text>
  <text start="1068.75" dur="6">make it look like Assad Russia they did</text>
  <text start="1073.64" dur="2.87">something this is why all this</text>
  <text start="1074.75" dur="5.37">propaganda is coming out right now</text>
  <text start="1076.51" dur="7.15">because we have to understand Russia</text>
  <text start="1080.12" dur="6.54">realizes what the US is about to do this</text>
  <text start="1083.66" dur="6.3">is why they&amp;#39;re warning the u.s. that</text>
  <text start="1086.66" dur="6.78">further aggression in Syria is going to</text>
  <text start="1089.96" dur="7.62">lead to a terrible tectonic consequences</text>
  <text start="1093.44" dur="7.26">because they understand that the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="1097.58" dur="5.31">preparing some type of an event we</text>
  <text start="1100.7" dur="5.22">we have a perfect storm heading our way</text>
  <text start="1102.89" dur="6.08">we have the elections we have an</text>
  <text start="1105.92" dur="7.05">economic collapse we have Deutsche Bank</text>
  <text start="1108.97" dur="5.8">we have the threat to the petrodollar we</text>
  <text start="1112.97" dur="7.17">have you worn out included in the SDR</text>
  <text start="1114.77" dur="10.53">basket the situation is ramping up right</text>
  <text start="1120.14" dur="9.81">now and the clock is ticking down we see</text>
  <text start="1125.3" dur="7.8">that Homeland Security is saying that</text>
  <text start="1129.95" dur="5.49">there might be cyber attacks ahead of</text>
  <text start="1133.1" dur="4.68">the 2016 vote now they said it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1135.44" dur="5.73">completely impossible then the FBI came</text>
  <text start="1137.78" dur="6.72">out and said yes we see there is probing</text>
  <text start="1141.17" dur="7.2">into 21 states hmm very interesting and</text>
  <text start="1144.5" dur="5.43">then DHS has come out cautioning the</text>
  <text start="1148.37" dur="4.14">authorities to watch out for cyber</text>
  <text start="1149.93" dur="5.06">attacks in the run-up to the 2016</text>
  <text start="1152.51" dur="5.76">presidential election I said this before</text>
  <text start="1154.99" dur="6.88">it all depends on how the elections go</text>
  <text start="1158.27" dur="5.46">and what their shadow polls show because</text>
  <text start="1161.87" dur="6.72">if they if they&amp;#39;re not getting the</text>
  <text start="1163.73" dur="7.26">candidate they want most likely they are</text>
  <text start="1168.59" dur="5.19">prepared and ready to postpone the</text>
  <text start="1170.99" dur="6.05">selection and this information coming</text>
  <text start="1173.78" dur="5.28">out of the FBI coming out of DHS now</text>

  <text start="1179.06" dur="6.15">additional cyber attacks they&amp;#39;re probing</text>
  <text start="1181.58" dur="5.97">it shows us that they&amp;#39;re preparing to do</text>
  <text start="1185.21" dur="4.29">something because the information that</text>
  <text start="1187.55" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re getting it&amp;#39;s not going in their</text>
  <text start="1189.5" dur="4.5">favor and they&amp;#39;re getting everything</text>
  <text start="1192.11" dur="3.66">prepared and ready to go because what</text>
