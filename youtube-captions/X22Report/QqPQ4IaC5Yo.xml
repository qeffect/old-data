  <text start="233.3" dur="6.3">number fell to six hundred and thirteen</text>
  <text start="236" dur="4.89">thousand that means there&amp;#39;s around two</text>
  <text start="239.6" dur="4.16">hundred and forty four thousand</text>
  <text start="240.89" dur="7.71">businesses that completely disappeared</text>
  <text start="243.76" dur="6.72">and it costs about a total of eight</text>
  <text start="248.6" dur="6.36">hundred and forty-two thousand jobs and</text>
  <text start="250.48" dur="8.319">thirty billion euros in products and as</text>

  <text start="258.799" dur="6.151">number is skyrocketing it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="262.22" dur="5.37">be any better it&amp;#39;s going to be worse now</text>
  <text start="264.95" dur="4.67">here in the States we see Puerto Rico</text>
  <text start="267.59" dur="4.56">and I know Puerto Rico is not a state</text>
  <text start="269.62" dur="5.23">but here in the United States Puerto</text>
  <text start="272.15" dur="7.26">Rico they&amp;#39;re going to be faulting on</text>
  <text start="274.85" dur="8.67">their two billion in debt today and what</text>
  <text start="279.41" dur="6.81">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is Alejandro</text>
  <text start="283.52" dur="4.17">Garcia Padilla he has issued an</text>
  <text start="286.22" dur="4.65">executive order authorizing the</text>
  <text start="287.69" dur="6">suspension of payments an addition also</text>
  <text start="290.87" dur="6.4">declared a state of emergency at the</text>
  <text start="293.69" dur="7.12">islands biggest public pension</text>
  <text start="297.27" dur="5.31">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is this</text>
  <text start="300.81" dur="6.36">pension is completely under funded by 99</text>
  <text start="302.58" dur="7.98">percent and this is the first time a</text>
  <text start="307.17" dur="7.11">u.s. territory has failed to pay on its</text>
  <text start="310.56" dur="5.43">general obligation bonds under these</text>
  <text start="314.28" dur="3.48">circumstances these executive orders</text>
  <text start="315.99" dur="4.44">protect the limited resources available</text>
  <text start="317.76" dur="5.04">to the agencies listed in these orders</text>
  <text start="320.43" dur="5.19">and prevents that these can be seized by</text>
  <text start="322.8" dur="6.36">creditors leaving Puerto Ricans without</text>
  <text start="325.62" dur="6.06">basic services so it looks like things</text>
  <text start="329.16" dur="7.32">are about to get a lot rougher in Puerto</text>
  <text start="331.68" dur="8.09">Rico Moody&amp;#39;s on the other hand they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="336.48" dur="7.56">looking at the US retail sector and</text>

  <text start="344.04" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re very disappointing and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="347.49" dur="7.58">looking at the major companies like</text>
  <text start="349.65" dur="8.64">Walmart macy&amp;#39;s nordstrom coals and</text>
  <text start="355.07" dur="5.53">they&amp;#39;ve lowered their expectations on us</text>
  <text start="358.29" dur="5.1">retail sales growth it used to be</text>
  <text start="360.6" dur="4.47">between four to five percent they have</text>
  <text start="363.39" dur="2.82">lowered it to two to three percent and</text>
  <text start="365.07" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;re saying as they go throughout</text>
  <text start="366.21" dur="4.2">this year they&amp;#39;re hoping the holiday</text>
  <text start="368.31" dur="4.89">season is really going to help out but</text>
  <text start="370.41" dur="5.67">if it doesn&amp;#39;t in it if it&amp;#39;s like what it</text>
  <text start="373.2" dur="6.21">was last year they&amp;#39;re saying sales</text>
  <text start="376.08" dur="8.01">growth might be around one percent this</text>

  <text start="401.46" dur="6.93">with the previous year and profits are</text>
  <text start="403.41" dur="8.24">down by more than half and we know that</text>
  <text start="408.39" dur="6.33">there&amp;#39;s a lot more stores closing and</text>
  <text start="411.65" dur="6.43">when we look at the situation things are</text>
  <text start="414.72" dur="5.61">deteriorating very very quickly I mean</text>
  <text start="418.08" dur="5.46">we&amp;#39;re in the middle of the summer right</text>
  <text start="420.33" dur="5.76">now middle of the year in the summer I</text>
  <text start="423.54" dur="4.47">should say and we&amp;#39;re starting to see the</text>
  <text start="426.09" dur="3.42">housing market completely fall apart the</text>
  <text start="428.01" dur="3.21">bubbles of popping in New York and San</text>

  <text start="431.22" dur="8.36">rental market is actually now sliding</text>
  <text start="434.79" dur="7.56">not doing as well as it was before and</text>
  <text start="439.58" dur="5.92">what we&amp;#39;re seeing now is that things are</text>
  <text start="442.35" dur="5.76">rapidly slowing down we know that</text>
  <text start="445.5" dur="5.04">manufacturing is not doing well we know</text>
  <text start="448.11" dur="6.83">the unemployment numbers are a complete</text>
  <text start="450.54" dur="9.75">lie we see construction spending well</text>
  <text start="454.94" dur="8.08">that is declining it has plunged three</text>
  <text start="460.29" dur="7.28">percent in the last two months this is</text>
  <text start="463.02" dur="4.55">the biggest drop since februari of 2011</text>
  <text start="467.66" dur="4.27">so when they tell us that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="469.8" dur="5.37">building like crazy housing is</text>
  <text start="471.93" dur="6.74">incredible well the opposite is</text>
  <text start="475.17" dur="6.18">happening right now all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="478.67" dur="5.56">things are starting to go the other way</text>
  <text start="481.35" dur="4.52">and we knew it would because we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="484.23" dur="5.01">tracking this we&amp;#39;ve been watching it now</text>
  <text start="485.87" dur="6.79">the IMF was out there and they have said</text>
  <text start="489.24" dur="7.38">Deutsche Bank poses the greatest risk to</text>
  <text start="492.66" dur="6.63">the global financial system they also</text>
  <text start="496.62" dur="5.46">said the German banking system poses a</text>
  <text start="499.29" dur="5.7">high degree of possible outward</text>
  <text start="502.08" dur="9.2">contagion well let&amp;#39;s not forget about</text>
  <text start="504.99" dur="8.79">the UK the US banks the banks in France</text>
  <text start="511.28" dur="5.65">they also have the highest degree of</text>
  <text start="513.78" dur="4.889">outward spill overs as measured by the</text>
  <text start="516.93" dur="3.72">average percentage of capital loss of</text>
  <text start="518.669" dur="5.461">other banking systems due to banking</text>
  <text start="520.65" dur="6.83">sector shock in the source country so</text>
  <text start="524.13" dur="6.75">what we&amp;#39;re looking at is at these banks</text>
  <text start="527.48" dur="6.67">they&amp;#39;re in big trouble right now I mean</text>
  <text start="530.88" dur="7.95">look at Italy for instance Italy their</text>
  <text start="534.15" dur="7.05">banking system is dying now we</text>
  <text start="538.83" dur="5.82">understand that Europe has a bail-in</text>
  <text start="541.2" dur="4.8">policy but we see that Italy was saying</text>
  <text start="544.65" dur="4.32">listen we&amp;#39;re not going to use the</text>
  <text start="546" dur="5.28">balance we want to bail out we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="548.97" dur="5.7">going in to take the deposits of the</text>
  <text start="551.28" dur="5.61">people we&amp;#39;re not doing it so the</text>
  <text start="554.67" dur="4.95">European Commission they&amp;#39;ve authorized</text>
  <text start="556.89" dur="5.54">Italy to use government guarantees to</text>
  <text start="559.62" dur="5.36">create a precautionary liquidity support</text>
  <text start="562.43" dur="6.88">program for their banks</text>
  <text start="564.98" dur="10.32">now what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="569.31" dur="5.99">the brexit as the excuse for this crisis</text>
  <text start="575.99" dur="5.68">so they&amp;#39;re saying because of this this</text>
  <text start="579.12" dur="4.92">is why we&amp;#39;ll do the bailouts this is why</text>
  <text start="581.67" dur="5.7">the banks are in tough shape right now</text>
  <text start="584.04" dur="9.69">and they&amp;#39;re going to use the breakfast</text>
  <text start="587.37" dur="10.74">crisis to achieve two things for</text>
  <text start="593.73" dur="5.85">quantitative easing which the Bank of</text>
  <text start="598.11" dur="6.6">England already said yes this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="599.58" dur="8.64">going to happen the ECB to facilitate</text>
  <text start="604.71" dur="8.79">bailouts for insolvent Italian banks and</text>
  <text start="608.22" dur="10.23">any other bank in the EU so when we look</text>
  <text start="613.5" dur="8.19">at this brexit we say to ourselves was</text>
  <text start="618.45" dur="7.2">this planned and I said this is my other</text>
  <text start="621.69" dur="7.44">report did they use this to deflate the</text>
  <text start="625.65" dur="6.99">bubble a little bit did they use this as</text>
  <text start="629.13" dur="7.079">a ploy to say ah because of what</text>
  <text start="632.64" dur="6.569">happened here we need to create more</text>
  <text start="636.209" dur="8.221">currency we need to save the banks by</text>
  <text start="639.209" dur="6.811">giving them funds and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="644.43" dur="5.97">see that this is exactly what has</text>
  <text start="646.02" dur="7.74">happened we&amp;#39;re still hearing talks about</text>
  <text start="650.4" dur="8.67">another referendum in the UK even though</text>
  <text start="653.76" dur="7.26">the petition that was put into place was</text>
  <text start="659.07" dur="5.28">completely fake phony and false because</text>
  <text start="661.02" dur="6.72">we realized that they were all fake</text>
  <text start="664.35" dur="6.239">signatures created by this script by a</text>
  <text start="667.74" dur="5.61">hacker bouncing it off all different</text>
  <text start="670.589" dur="5.551">servers and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="673.35" dur="7.83">is there still pushing for a second</text>
  <text start="676.14" dur="7.29">referendum because remember the UK is</text>
  <text start="681.18" dur="6.3">still part of the EU they haven&amp;#39;t done</text>
  <text start="683.43" dur="5.94">anything yet if they can get this second</text>
  <text start="687.48" dur="5.16">referendum and I continually here John</text>
  <text start="689.37" dur="5.13">Kerry out there saying that the UK can</text>
  <text start="692.64" dur="6.03">stay with the EU it&amp;#39;s not that difficult</text>
  <text start="694.5" dur="5.93">and I think they use this as a ploy</text>
  <text start="698.67" dur="5.25">and eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="700.43" dur="6.52">they&amp;#39;re going to have this next</text>
  <text start="703.92" dur="5.84">referendum and the UK is going to say</text>
  <text start="706.95" dur="4.86">sorry we&amp;#39;re going to stay with the EU</text>
  <text start="709.76" dur="3.76">maybe they&amp;#39;ll come out with something</text>
  <text start="711.81" dur="5.46">like they give they&amp;#39;ve given us a better</text>
  <text start="713.52" dur="6">deal something&amp;#39;s a lot better but we</text>
  <text start="717.27" dur="5.01">hear from George Soros when he was</text>
  <text start="719.52" dur="5.82">giving a speech discussing the EU and</text>
  <text start="722.28" dur="8.85">the wake of the brexit and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="725.34" dur="9.24">discussing how the EU can take a giant</text>
  <text start="731.13" dur="7.68">leap forward how the EU can be</text>
  <text start="734.58" dur="8.88">strengthened by this brexit into a</text>
  <text start="738.81" dur="6.99">greater Central superpower paid for by</text>
  <text start="743.46" dur="5.94">the subjects living within the EU region</text>

  <text start="871.2" dur="8.97">see if the UK actually leaves the EU</text>
  <text start="876.68" dur="4.57">right now I believe the central bankers</text>
