  <text start="219.59" dur="4.38">things are not going to get better</text>
  <text start="221.39" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re going to get worse and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="223.97" dur="5.489">using the propaganda to convince</text>
  <text start="225.95" dur="6.12">everyone if things are improving and</text>
  <text start="229.459" dur="7.641">they&amp;#39;re especially doing this here in</text>
  <text start="232.07" dur="10.32">America now India is really hurting</text>
  <text start="237.1" dur="9.49">their their currency is falling and</text>
  <text start="242.39" dur="7.89">they&amp;#39;re looking now at temples and they</text>
  <text start="246.59" dur="5.94">want them to disclose what type of gold</text>
  <text start="250.28" dur="5.19">reserves I have at this point because</text>
  <text start="252.53" dur="11.04">they might end up confiscating this gold</text>
  <text start="255.47" dur="10.08">here in india and poland while</text>
  <text start="263.57" dur="4.17">everything was going on with syria</text>
  <text start="265.55" dur="4.76">people who are looking at Greece people</text>
  <text start="267.74" dur="5.58">were looking at cypress poulan</text>
  <text start="270.31" dur="6.67">confiscated half of private pension fund</text>
  <text start="273.32" dur="5.46">to cut sovereign debt load and this</text>
  <text start="276.98" dur="4.11">happened on Wednesday the Prime Minister</text>
  <text start="278.78" dur="4.35">Donald Tusk said private funds within</text>
  <text start="281.09" dur="3.63">the state guaranteed system would have</text>
  <text start="283.13" dur="3.81">their bond holdings transferred to a</text>
  <text start="284.72" dur="3.99">state pension vehicle but keep their</text>
  <text start="286.94" dur="3.84">equity holdings the funds would</text>
  <text start="288.71" dur="4.89">effectively be left with only the equity</text>
  <text start="290.78" dur="7.08">portions of their assets and even this</text>
  <text start="293.6" dur="6.69">will be depleted in the future and this</text>
  <text start="297.86" dur="5.43">also goes on to say that the end result</text>
  <text start="300.29" dur="6.09">the polish pension funds organization</text>
  <text start="303.29" dur="4.8">said the changes may be unconstitutional</text>
  <text start="306.38" dur="4.02">because the government is taking private</text>
  <text start="308.09" dur="5.37">assets away from them without offering</text>
  <text start="310.4" dur="5.9">any compensation this may lead to the</text>
  <text start="313.46" dur="5.31">private pension system shutting down and</text>
  <text start="316.3" dur="4.45">Jim Rogers I believe was out there</text>
  <text start="318.77" dur="3.72">saying this is going to happen in the</text>
  <text start="320.75" dur="4.65">u.s. we see this happening in Detroit</text>
  <text start="322.49" dur="4.98">and we are going to start to see this</text>
  <text start="325.4" dur="4.29">throughout the country because when the</text>
  <text start="327.47" dur="4.02">collapse hits they&amp;#39;re going to go after</text>
  <text start="329.69" dur="3.66">the pensions there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="331.49" dur="4.59">balanced on the banks they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="333.35" dur="4.41">be bad bank holidays where people can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="336.08" dur="4.05">get their money just like in Cyprus</text>
  <text start="337.76" dur="6.66">capital controls are still in effect in</text>
  <text start="340.13" dur="6">Cyprus that has not changed Ireland we</text>
  <text start="344.42" dur="5.28">see now that they&amp;#39;re coming out of their</text>
  <text start="346.13" dur="6.33">bailout and but they&amp;#39;re looking for a 10</text>
  <text start="349.7" dur="6.39">billion euros to have as an insurance</text>
  <text start="352.46" dur="6.39">policy for unforeseen international</text>
  <text start="356.09" dur="6.09">crisis do they see something happening</text>
  <text start="358.85" dur="5.19">that they&amp;#39;re not telling us but this is</text>
  <text start="362.18" dur="4.35">a very odd thing to do at this point</text>
  <text start="364.04" dur="6.03">it&amp;#39;s like having an overdraft on your</text>
  <text start="366.53" dur="5.67">bank just in case you have no more funds</text>
  <text start="370.07" dur="7.73">in your account and you&amp;#39;re still need to</text>
  <text start="372.2" dur="9.3">write checks but today the unemployment</text>
  <text start="377.8" dur="6.67">results came out and of course just like</text>
  <text start="381.5" dur="7.56">every single all the time the</text>
  <text start="384.47" dur="10.26">unemployment numbers went down by 1% by</text>
  <text start="389.06" dur="8.97">0.1% I should say and right now the</text>
  <text start="394.73" dur="5.34">government the Fed are making it seem</text>
  <text start="398.03" dur="3.84">like the economy is getting better</text>
  <text start="400.07" dur="4.53">because you have to remember the people</text>
  <text start="401.87" dur="5.07">see these numbers they see oh look at</text>
  <text start="404.6" dur="4.77">one from seven point four percent 27</text>
  <text start="406.94" dur="5.69">point three percent oh look houses</text>
  <text start="409.37" dur="5.61">housing is up oh look the headline say</text>
  <text start="412.63" dur="5.5">retailers are giving deep discounts and</text>
  <text start="414.98" dur="6.51">retailer sales are up what the people</text>
  <text start="418.13" dur="5.97">are seeing is the propaganda that</text>
  <text start="421.49" dur="4.74">everything is getting better but you</text>
  <text start="424.1" dur="6.81">have to understand but the actual</text>
  <text start="426.23" dur="8.16">unemployed rate is really went from 11.2</text>
  <text start="430.91" dur="5.1">percent to 11.4 percent if we use the</text>
  <text start="434.39" dur="4.56">calculation prior to nineteen</text>
  <text start="436.01" dur="5.79">ninety-four we&amp;#39;re really close to twenty</text>
  <text start="438.95" dur="5.52">four percent but they don&amp;#39;t want you to</text>
  <text start="441.8" dur="4.95">see that they want you to see what</text>
  <text start="444.47" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re trying to show you they do not</text>
  <text start="446.75" dur="4.5">count the people that have no longer</text>
  <text start="449" dur="3.39">that are no longer looking for work</text>
  <text start="451.25" dur="4.53">because they&amp;#39;ve just given up because</text>
  <text start="452.39" dur="5.64">there&amp;#39;s just no jobs they are counting</text>
  <text start="455.78" dur="5.58">people who have who went from a let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="458.03" dur="7.14">say an $80,000 full-time job to a</text>
  <text start="461.36" dur="5.88">part-time job making 22 or thirty</text>
  <text start="465.17" dur="4.53">thousand dollars that person is now</text>
  <text start="467.24" dur="5.19">employed but of course that person lost</text>
  <text start="469.7" dur="4.92">their house that person can&amp;#39;t make their</text>
  <text start="472.43" dur="6.51">bill payments but guess what they still</text>
  <text start="474.62" dur="7.14">count as being employed and we also have</text>
  <text start="478.94" dur="6.06">to look at the quality of these jobs</text>
  <text start="481.76" dur="5.909">that they&amp;#39;re talking about here we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="485" dur="6.36">looking at forty four thousand jobs</text>
  <text start="487.669" dur="6">added in the retail trade well that that</text>
  <text start="491.36" dur="6.27">counts for all that part time work plus</text>
  <text start="493.669" dur="9.051">a lot of these companies now are making</text>
  <text start="497.63" dur="8.43">their full-time full hours go to a</text>
  <text start="502.72" dur="7.36">part-time job and part-time hours</text>
  <text start="506.06" dur="6.859">because of Obamacare we see that 43,000</text>
  <text start="510.08" dur="6.66">jobs were added to education and health</text>
  <text start="512.919" dur="6.67">27,000 to leisure and hospitality 17,000</text>
  <text start="516.74" dur="7.61">to government and 13,000 to temp help</text>
  <text start="519.589" dur="7.5">services so i don&amp;#39;t see manufacturing</text>

  <text start="530.12" dur="6.84">adding again our service oriented</text>
  <text start="533.03" dur="7.53">positions so when they talk about the</text>
  <text start="536.96" dur="6.12">jobs this is complete propaganda</text>

  <text start="1530.89" dur="7.4">Syrian war the base is underground it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1533.71" dur="7.59">impervious to missiles and bombs there</text>
  <text start="1538.29" dur="6.76">2200 Marines that could reach Syria</text>
  <text start="1541.3" dur="6.03">within hours and they tried sending in</text>
  <text start="1545.05" dur="4.86">the paid mercenaries which the US forces</text>
  <text start="1547.33" dur="5.31">trained they didn&amp;#39;t even get close to</text>
  <text start="1549.91" dur="5.43">inside of Syria before Assad crush them</text>
  <text start="1552.64" dur="5.52">and that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re training tactics</text>
  <text start="1555.34" dur="6.54">right now because that limited strike</text>
  <text start="1558.16" dur="6.14">was going to try to hurt Assad forces</text>
  <text start="1561.88" dur="4.89">enough where these paid mercenaries</text>
  <text start="1564.3" dur="5.95">would be able to get into the country</text>
  <text start="1566.77" dur="6.539">and overthrow Assad but that has changed</text>
  <text start="1570.25" dur="6.5">so their plan has to change and this is</text>
  <text start="1573.309" dur="7.11">why we&amp;#39;re seeing this right now and</text>
  <text start="1576.75" dur="6.13">again as we know there are other things</text>
  <text start="1580.419" dur="5.881">that are happening we need to look out</text>
  <text start="1582.88" dur="5.549">because right now it is predicted and</text>
  <text start="1586.3" dur="4.77">reports are coming in that Congress is</text>
  <text start="1588.429" dur="7.141">going with a no vote to this entire</text>
  <text start="1591.07" dur="8.55">thing and if they do vote no the central</text>
  <text start="1595.57" dur="6.33">bankers US government globalist the</text>
  <text start="1599.62" dur="7.04">elite will not stop</text>
  <text start="1601.9" dur="4.76">this is the biggest worry at this point</text>
  <text start="1607.38" dur="7.39">now the FBI just added the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1611.74" dur="5.88">electric army to the mo to the wanted</text>
  <text start="1614.77" dur="4.89">list and the Syrian electric army a</text>
  <text start="1617.62" dur="3.3">pro-regime hacker group that emerged</text>
  <text start="1619.66" dur="4.2">during the Syrian anti-government</text>
  <text start="1620.92" dur="5.31">protest in 2011 has been compromising</text>
  <text start="1623.86" dur="5.07">high-profile media outlets in an effort</text>
  <text start="1626.23" dur="5.03">to spread pro-regime propaganda the</text>
  <text start="1628.93" dur="5.37">essays primary capabilities include</text>
  <text start="1631.26" dur="6.04">spearfishing web defacements and hijacks</text>
  <text start="1634.3" dur="5.46">hijacking social media accounts to</text>
  <text start="1637.3" dur="6.03">spread propaganda and what they fear is</text>
  <text start="1639.76" dur="7.29">that these cyber attacks will grow and</text>
  <text start="1643.33" dur="7.77">eventually hit the power grid or the</text>
  <text start="1647.05" dur="10.56">financial institutions and and bring</text>
  <text start="1651.1" dur="8.57">down the US economy and collapse it now</text>
  <text start="1657.61" dur="5.84">there was another report saying that</text>
  <text start="1659.67" dur="7.8">iranians are preparing a terror campaign</text>
  <text start="1663.45" dur="7.99">inside the US and we understand that</text>
  <text start="1667.47" dur="5.89">there was a nuke moved to the east coast</text>
  <text start="1671.44" dur="3.78">and I believe there&amp;#39;s Senator Graham is</text>
  <text start="1673.36" dur="5.43">out there saying that there could be</text>
  <text start="1675.22" dur="7.1">some type of nuclear false flag in South</text>
  <text start="1678.79" dur="7.77">Carolina or somewhere around there and</text>
  <text start="1682.32" dur="10.09">this goes on to say that those that they</text>
  <text start="1686.56" dur="8.84">could hit any place in America because</text>
  <text start="1692.41" dur="5.97">they have forces already positioned and</text>
  <text start="1695.4" dur="6.54">the targets that they could be targeting</text>
  <text start="1698.38" dur="6.54">are things like water utilities</text>
  <text start="1701.94" dur="5.11">electrical substations and other</text>
  <text start="1704.92" dur="4.11">potential targets to give the guard the</text>
  <text start="1707.05" dur="5.04">ability to quickly order a terror strike</text>
  <text start="1709.03" dur="6.27">in our homeland and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="1712.09" dur="7.59">they or have already positioned people</text>
  <text start="1715.3" dur="7.23">inside the country to handle this but</text>
  <text start="1719.68" dur="6.51">then again we also understand that there</text>
  <text start="1722.53" dur="6.54">is a cyberattack threat a private sector</text>
  <text start="1726.19" dur="5.64">advisory issued by the FBI there is also</text>
  <text start="1729.07" dur="4.41">a million muslim march no no no there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1731.83" dur="3.42">going to be a million muslims there but</text>
  <text start="1733.48" dur="5.73">there is a million muslim march</text>
  <text start="1735.25" dur="6.29">on DC on 911 and to counteract the</text>
  <text start="1739.21" dur="6.75">million Muslim arch there&amp;#39;s also a biker</text>
  <text start="1741.54" dur="8.29">drive-in into DC and later this year</text>
  <text start="1745.96" dur="5.67">there&amp;#39;s a power grid drill to test</text>
  <text start="1749.83" dur="4.29">against cyber attacks and the other</text>
  <text start="1751.63" dur="6.3">attacks and it seems like this is all</text>
  <text start="1754.12" dur="7.41">starting to play into a huge false flag</text>
  <text start="1757.93" dur="6.63">that is coming this fall I mean I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1761.53" dur="6.51">know anyway and any other way to look at</text>
  <text start="1764.56" dur="6.3">this at this time and there was another</text>
  <text start="1768.04" dur="7.62">report out there saying that Iran plots</text>
  <text start="1770.86" dur="6.99">revenge if us hits Syria and this is</text>
  <text start="1775.66" dur="6.15">coming from intercepted messages they</text>
  <text start="1777.85" dur="6.36">intercepted from I the you know I from</text>
  <text start="1781.81" dur="4.02">Iran and again they were all using pay</text>
  <text start="1784.21" dur="5.19">phones and they were in chat rooms and</text>
  <text start="1785.83" dur="5.67">the NSA and other agencies were able to</text>
  <text start="1789.4" dur="3.99">intercept this because you know all</text>
  <text start="1791.5" dur="3.99">these forces they don&amp;#39;t use encryption</text>
  <text start="1793.39" dur="4.32">they don&amp;#39;t use codes they just go out</text>
  <text start="1795.49" dur="3.48">there and say hey listen if this happens</text>
  <text start="1797.71" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;re going to strike someplace in the</text>
  <text start="1798.97" dur="6.09">US and this goes on to say the US has</text>
  <text start="1802.93" dur="4.65">intercepted in order from Iran to</text>
  <text start="1805.06" dur="5.4">militants in Iraq to attack the US</text>
  <text start="1807.58" dur="6.33">Embassy and other American interests in</text>
  <text start="1810.46" dur="7.65">Baghdad and in other places in the event</text>
  <text start="1813.91" dur="6.06">of a strike on Syria military officials</text>
  <text start="1818.11" dur="4.8">have been trying to predict a range of</text>
  <text start="1819.97" dur="5.52">possible responses from Syria Iran and</text>
  <text start="1822.91" dur="4.98">their allies US officials said they are</text>
  <text start="1825.49" dur="5.37">on alert fryer and fleet of small fast</text>
  <text start="1827.89" dur="5.4">boats in the Persian Gulf where American</text>
  <text start="1830.86" dur="4.65">warships are positioned US officials</text>
  <text start="1833.29" dur="5.7">also for your Hezbollah could attack the</text>
  <text start="1835.51" dur="6.93">US embassy in Beirut and again this is</text>
  <text start="1838.99" dur="8.51">why they&amp;#39;re asking us personnel to leave</text>
  <text start="1842.44" dur="7.5">and it&amp;#39;s very telling that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1847.5" dur="6.07">letting everyone know that there are</text>
  <text start="1849.94" dur="6.63">fast small boats in the area that could</text>
  <text start="1853.57" dur="6.27">wreak havoc on the fleet it could they</text>
  <text start="1856.57" dur="7.62">could bomb embassies and if they do that</text>
  <text start="1859.84" dur="6.66">that is an attack on the US and at this</text>
  <text start="1864.19" dur="5">point the president could bypass</text>
  <text start="1866.5" dur="7.58">Congress and say the US was just</text>
  <text start="1869.19" dur="8.12">tact and create and prepare and go for a</text>
  <text start="1874.08" dur="6.17">strike in Syria and we can see this</text>
  <text start="1877.31" dur="8.14">unfolding right in front of our eyes and</text>
