  <text start="130.71" dur="4.62">situation remember this has been planned</text>
  <text start="133.56" dur="4.29">now something very interesting came out</text>
  <text start="135.33" dur="4.41">of CNBC with Reuters they did this poll</text>
  <text start="137.85" dur="4.65">and we&amp;#39;ll be talking about that in just</text>

  <text start="142.5" dur="6.18">entire plan we&amp;#39;re now they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="146.16" dur="5.79">nervous and they don&amp;#39;t know what to do</text>

  <text start="151.95" dur="5.369">the Patriots set and it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="154.95" dur="4.77">amazing now we understand we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="157.319" dur="3.84">into the holiday season and the</text>
  <text start="159.72" dur="2.099">mainstream media is out there saying</text>
  <text start="161.159" dur="2.791">that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="161.819" dur="4.351">to be a fantastic holiday season we also</text>
  <text start="163.95" dur="3.659">need to remember that the FICO scores</text>
  <text start="166.17" dur="3.149">were adjusted more people are getting</text>
  <text start="167.609" dur="4.77">credit cards more people gonna be</text>
  <text start="169.319" dur="6.81">putting their purchases on debt using</text>
  <text start="172.379" dur="6.961">debt instruments and this isn&amp;#39;t a sign</text>
  <text start="176.129" dur="4.651">of prosperity this is a sign of wow I</text>
  <text start="179.34" dur="3.42">can get another credit card I have</text>
  <text start="180.78" dur="4.14">another two three four five ten thousand</text>
  <text start="182.76" dur="5.28">dollars and I can go out and purchase</text>
  <text start="184.92" dur="6.899">goods to make myself feel good but later</text>
  <text start="188.04" dur="5.819">on you have to pay this off one way or</text>
  <text start="191.819" dur="4.831">another and this is where delinquency is</text>
  <text start="193.859" dur="5.341">coming and it really shoots up right</text>
  <text start="196.65" dur="4.619">after holidays but what we&amp;#39;re seeing in</text>
  <text start="199.2" dur="5.64">the real tip in the retail market is</text>
  <text start="201.269" dur="6.12">that it is not going well for</text>
  <text start="204.84" dur="5.819">brick-and-mortar stores and when we look</text>
  <text start="207.389" dur="7.44">at the entire industry with restaurants</text>
  <text start="210.659" dur="6.931">bars stores well it&amp;#39;s not going well now</text>
  <text start="214.829" dur="6.961">real retail sales adjusted for inflation</text>
  <text start="217.59" dur="7.799">is not so hot it&amp;#39;s only risen about 2%</text>
  <text start="221.79" dur="7.5">in October this was at the lower end of</text>
  <text start="225.389" dur="4.5">the post financial crisis range online</text>
  <text start="229.29" dur="2.729">sales</text>
  <text start="229.889" dur="5.16">well that is soaring right now now</text>
  <text start="232.019" dur="5.881">remember online sales it&amp;#39;s pretty new I</text>
  <text start="235.049" dur="6.09">mean it started to take off around 2014</text>
  <text start="237.9" dur="6.809">2013 around that area so the only place</text>
  <text start="241.139" dur="6.481">ecommerce has to go is up because more</text>
  <text start="244.709" dur="5.071">and more business will create an online</text>
  <text start="247.62" dur="3.109">presence more and more businesses will</text>
  <text start="249.78" dur="4.229">sell online</text>
  <text start="250.729" dur="5.23">now we&amp;#39;re gonna see online move up the</text>
  <text start="254.009" dur="5.551">problem here is that the online</text>
  <text start="255.959" dur="5.911">businesses they are moving up but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="259.56" dur="3.87">not taking the place of the</text>
  <text start="261.87" dur="3.75">brick-and-mortar stores that are coming</text>
  <text start="263.43" dur="5.519">down I mean department stores right now</text>
  <text start="265.62" dur="7.019">they plunge 36% and if you look at</text>
  <text start="268.949" dur="5.821">online sales that has gone up 14% so</text>
  <text start="272.639" dur="4.62">we&amp;#39;re missing something here and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="274.77" dur="6.03">a lot of stores that are closing bonds</text>
  <text start="277.259" dur="4.65">on stores Nordstrom JCPenney Sears you</text>
  <text start="280.8" dur="2.73">know many of these stores are going</text>
  <text start="281.909" dur="4.021">bankrupt Toys R Us doesn&amp;#39;t even exist</text>
  <text start="283.53" dur="4.229">anymore many stores after this holiday</text>
  <text start="285.93" dur="4.41">season are not going to exist and what</text>
  <text start="287.759" dur="5.91">happens when these stores closed we have</text>
  <text start="290.34" dur="4.109">a lot of retail space open malls are</text>
  <text start="293.669" dur="3.541">strong</text>
  <text start="294.449" dur="6.27">right now and it&amp;#39;s very very difficult</text>
  <text start="297.21" dur="6.509">for them and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="300.719" dur="5.97">the people even though the statistical</text>
  <text start="303.719" dur="6.181">numbers in the stock market GDP and</text>
  <text start="306.689" dur="6.09">unemployment and the rest those look</text>
  <text start="309.9" dur="5.189">fantastic the everyday person is still</text>
  <text start="312.779" dur="4.17">feeling the pain yes we got some tax</text>
  <text start="315.089" dur="4.47">relief but we need to remember something</text>
  <text start="316.949" dur="5.791">very very important here we are still in</text>
  <text start="319.559" dur="4.29">a central bank system Trump the Patriots</text>
  <text start="322.74" dur="1.679">can&amp;#39;t come in and say hey you know</text>
  <text start="323.849" dur="2.97">something</text>
  <text start="324.419" dur="4.321">I know we have 21 trillion worth of debt</text>
  <text start="326.819" dur="4.141">and that&amp;#39;s gonna continually rise we</text>
  <text start="328.74" dur="4.109">know the global economy has hundreds of</text>
  <text start="330.96" dur="2.94">trillions worth of debt and we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="332.849" dur="3.54">gonna make things better</text>
  <text start="333.9" dur="4.169">it&amp;#39;s completely impossible this is why</text>
  <text start="336.389" dur="3.631">businesses go bankrupt when they have</text>
  <text start="338.069" dur="3.541">too much debt it&amp;#39;s the same thing for</text>
  <text start="340.02" dur="3.149">countries actually there&amp;#39;s no difference</text>
  <text start="341.61" dur="3.57">whatsoever I know they want you to think</text>
  <text start="343.169" dur="4.53">there&amp;#39;s a difference but there really</text>
  <text start="345.18" dur="4.949">isn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s just a credit card that they</text>
  <text start="347.699" dur="4.74">keep borrowing money off of and at a</text>
  <text start="350.129" dur="3.87">certain point when enough people are</text>
  <text start="352.439" dur="3.21">working when there&amp;#39;s not enough revenue</text>
  <text start="353.999" dur="3.15">coming into the government when there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="355.649" dur="2.58">too many entitlement programs when</text>
  <text start="357.149" dur="5.64">there&amp;#39;s just too much of everything</text>
  <text start="358.229" dur="6.69">something has to give and Trump in the</text>
  <text start="362.789" dur="5.22">Patriots they know this they know</text>
  <text start="364.919" dur="6.3">eventually this system will give out</text>
  <text start="368.009" dur="6.45">this is why Trump has Andrew Jackson</text>
  <text start="371.219" dur="4.92">hanging on his wall and it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="374.459" dur="4.25">about getting rid of the central bank</text>
  <text start="376.139" dur="5.64">they understand for this plan to work</text>
  <text start="378.709" dur="7.3">and to give the power back to We the</text>
  <text start="381.779" dur="6.87">People you just can&amp;#39;t get rid of certain</text>
  <text start="386.009" dur="5.071">individuals and put them in a prison you</text>
  <text start="388.649" dur="5.79">need to shut down the whole entire</text>
  <text start="391.08" dur="6.69">operation that was started back in 1913</text>
  <text start="394.439" dur="5.31">and this was a Rothschild system</text>
  <text start="397.77" dur="3.269">actually if you look at the busy look at</text>
  <text start="399.749" dur="5.34">the IMF you looked the Fed you looked</text>
  <text start="401.039" dur="7.17">the ECB they&amp;#39;re all Rothschilds systems</text>
  <text start="405.089" dur="5.82">if you look at what Q is said in his</text>
  <text start="408.209" dur="5.911">post where they list all the banks these</text>
  <text start="410.909" dur="5.91">are all Rothschilds banks Q from the</text>
  <text start="414.12" dur="6">very beginning told us that they need to</text>
  <text start="416.819" dur="5.76">go after all of this now this will come</text>
  <text start="420.12" dur="5.94">later on they&amp;#39;re preparing for it and</text>
  <text start="422.579" dur="4.971">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about how Trump and</text>
  <text start="426.06" dur="3.92">the Patriots have been knew</text>
  <text start="427.55" dur="4.92">in controlling the narrative making the</text>
  <text start="429.98" dur="5.94">mainstream media making the deep state</text>
  <text start="432.47" dur="6.15">the establishment point the finger at</text>
  <text start="435.92" dur="4.68">the Fed now we know that Jim Kramer you</text>
  <text start="438.62" dur="5.34">know the Wall Street Journal they all</text>
  <text start="440.6" dur="6">were out there reporting that yes the</text>
  <text start="443.96" dur="4.26">Fed should slow down they should wait</text>
  <text start="446.6" dur="3.87">they should see what&amp;#39;s happening because</text>
  <text start="448.22" dur="4.86">they all know if you raise the interest</text>
  <text start="450.47" dur="5.79">rates the way they&amp;#39;re doing it the</text>
  <text start="453.08" dur="5.4">entire systems going to come down now we</text>
  <text start="456.26" dur="4.11">know the Federal Reserve is expected to</text>
  <text start="458.48" dur="5.72">raise the interest rates again next</text>
  <text start="460.37" dur="10.08">month and maybe three times next year</text>
  <text start="464.2" dur="10.36">reuters they ran a poll with economists</text>
  <text start="470.45" dur="7.73">now this is very interesting their poll</text>
  <text start="474.56" dur="6.18">and we know what Q says about polls it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="478.18" dur="6.01">created to make people think a certain</text>
  <text start="480.74" dur="7.1">way and to go along with it so this form</text>
  <text start="484.19" dur="7.76">of brainwashing and they said that a</text>
  <text start="487.84" dur="9.82">strong majority of economist said that</text>
  <text start="491.95" dur="9.67">the Federal Reserve should slow down the</text>
  <text start="497.66" dur="6.96">number of rate hikes and basically what</text>
  <text start="501.62" dur="7.05">they said was the Fed should deliver</text>
  <text start="504.62" dur="6.45">fewer rate hikes what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="508.67" dur="6.18">right now is they&amp;#39;re trying to figure</text>
  <text start="511.07" dur="7.38">out a way to convince everyone that the</text>
  <text start="514.85" dur="6.63">Fed should slow down but when you really</text>
  <text start="518.45" dur="6.48">look at this they&amp;#39;re all on the same</text>
  <text start="521.48" dur="6.84">page as Trump remember in the beginning</text>
  <text start="524.93" dur="5.91">when he contradicted the Fed he was out</text>
  <text start="528.32" dur="5.07">there saying well I thought this was an</text>
  <text start="530.84" dur="3.9">easy money Fed I didn&amp;#39;t realize he was</text>
  <text start="533.39" dur="4.38">gonna be raising the interest rates like</text>
  <text start="534.74" dur="5.15">this we have debt coming soon he even</text>
  <text start="537.77" dur="4.77">said listen if the system falls apart</text>
  <text start="539.89" dur="4.87">I&amp;#39;m going to blame the Fed because they</text>
  <text start="542.54" dur="3.9">were raising the rates now at that point</text>
  <text start="544.76" dur="3.81">the mainstream media kind of laughed at</text>
  <text start="546.44" dur="5.4">him how dare you contradict the Fed how</text>
  <text start="548.57" dur="6.06">dare you do this this isn&amp;#39;t right then</text>
  <text start="551.84" dur="4.65">as time went on as he kept improving the</text>
  <text start="554.63" dur="3.99">economy through manipulation the same</text>
  <text start="556.49" dur="3.92">manipulation the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="558.62" dur="4.79">deep state have used in the past</text>
  <text start="560.41" dur="6.69">all of a sudden their narrative kind of</text>
  <text start="563.41" dur="6.21">disappeared and now the Fed is raising</text>
  <text start="567.1" dur="5.279">rates and the tariffs that Trump put</text>
  <text start="569.62" dur="6.42">into place they can&amp;#39;t blame him now you</text>
  <text start="572.379" dur="7.051">see the mainstream media they&amp;#39;re siding</text>
  <text start="576.04" dur="5.669">with Trump saying yes we need to stop</text>
  <text start="579.43" dur="4.29">this because they know exactly what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="581.709" dur="5.401">going to happen they know if the Fed</text>
  <text start="583.72" dur="4.32">continues on the entire system falls</text>
  <text start="587.11" dur="4.349">apart</text>
  <text start="588.04" dur="4.979">this is why Trump has been maneuvering</text>
  <text start="591.459" dur="3.651">like this this has all been</text>
  <text start="593.019" dur="5.911">strategically planned already</text>
  <text start="595.11" dur="7.06">it&amp;#39;s military planning at its best and</text>
  <text start="598.93" dur="6.63">they&amp;#39;re doing this on purpose they need</text>
  <text start="602.17" dur="6.089">to shift the focus and the focus will be</text>
  <text start="605.56" dur="7.98">on the central bank system not just the</text>
  <text start="608.259" dur="8.82">Fed the focus will be on the ECB IMF and</text>
  <text start="613.54" dur="6.649">the biz now if you really think about it</text>
  <text start="617.079" dur="5.24">all these central banks they are doing</text>
  <text start="620.189" dur="5.2">different things right now they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="622.319" dur="5.801">working together they&amp;#39;re not in unison</text>
  <text start="625.389" dur="4.351">where they&amp;#39;re all lowering the rates yes</text>
  <text start="628.12" dur="2.699">there are some central banks saying that</text>
  <text start="629.74" dur="2.25">they&amp;#39;re going to be raising the rates</text>
  <text start="630.819" dur="5.161">but that&amp;#39;s next year</text>
  <text start="631.99" dur="6.51">right now the Fed they are raising the</text>
  <text start="635.98" dur="3.81">rates they&amp;#39;re pushing it up and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="638.5" dur="4.37">doing it quite quickly</text>
  <text start="639.79" dur="5.75">they&amp;#39;re also unwinding at the same time</text>
  <text start="642.87" dur="5.56">think about what is happening here and</text>
  <text start="645.54" dur="4.39">if you notice Powell isn&amp;#39;t out there</text>
  <text start="648.43" dur="2.55">saying hey we&amp;#39;re gonna slow this down</text>
  <text start="649.93" dur="2.7">we&amp;#39;re gonna cut it off</text>
  <text start="650.98" dur="4.349">no more raising the interest rates we</text>

  <text start="677.439" dur="9.63">biggest threat to the world the amount</text>
  <text start="682.18" dur="9.65">of control the amount of power that the</text>
  <text start="687.069" dur="7.431">central bank has is just off the charts</text>
  <text start="691.83" dur="4.59">I mean people think ooh Comey has a lot</text>

  <text start="704.84" dur="6.42">yes they were born out of this system</text>
  <text start="708.51" dur="6.69">which is completely corrupt treasonous</text>
  <text start="711.26" dur="8.2">but they aren&amp;#39;t powerful like the</text>

  <text start="719.46" dur="9.3">power to make countries do whatever they</text>
  <text start="723.84" dur="8.09">want and all they have to do is put them</text>
  <text start="728.76" dur="8.85">into debt then they control them and</text>
  <text start="731.93" dur="9.34">they know this and this is the single</text>
  <text start="737.61" dur="6.5">biggest threat to the United States to</text>
  <text start="741.27" dur="6.36">the world and this is why the plan</text>
  <text start="744.11" dur="5.35">revolves around the central bank now</text>
  <text start="747.63" dur="4.26">there are certain elements that you need</text>
  <text start="749.46" dur="5.97">to remove first before you go to the</text>
  <text start="751.89" dur="6.11">meat and potatoes but in the end you</text>
  <text start="755.43" dur="5.67">need to get rid of the meat and potatoes</text>
  <text start="758" dur="5.74">so nothing else is born out of this</text>
  <text start="761.1" dur="6.81">system the system has to be destroyed</text>
  <text start="763.74" dur="7.71">the world has to come together rally and</text>

  <text start="774.93" dur="5.55">it&amp;#39;s not working for the people they</text>
  <text start="778.77" dur="4.94">don&amp;#39;t have our best interest at heart</text>
  <text start="780.48" dur="8.01">and the founding fathers of this country</text>
  <text start="783.71" dur="6.76">never wanted it to be this way they</text>
  <text start="788.49" dur="5.58">didn&amp;#39;t put in the Constitution by the</text>

  <text start="796.02" dur="5.22">private corporation they didn&amp;#39;t put that</text>
  <text start="798.15" dur="8.88">in there and back then yes they said</text>
  <text start="801.24" dur="9.48">coin your own currency we the people the</text>
  <text start="807.03" dur="8.16">government will coin our own currency</text>
  <text start="810.72" dur="5.85">now back then silver gold they were it</text>
  <text start="815.19" dur="7.05">was worth something think about it today</text>
  <text start="816.57" dur="7.54">if you had four quarters and they were</text>
  <text start="822.24" dur="5.32">all silver</text>

  <text start="830.5" dur="7.62">Federal Reserve dollar in real money</text>
  <text start="835.14" dur="6.4">those four quarters that are silver and</text>
  <text start="838.12" dur="5.64">if you had them before 1964 that would</text>
  <text start="841.54" dur="5.36">be worth if you go with what the price</text>
  <text start="843.76" dur="5.82">of silver is today it would be worth</text>
  <text start="846.9" dur="6.01">what twelve to fourteen dollars each</text>
  <text start="849.58" dur="6.33">coin so four times say fourteen dollars</text>
  <text start="852.91" dur="6.87">less matte Brown dollar fifteen fifteen</text>
  <text start="855.91" dur="9.33">times four those four quarters would be</text>
  <text start="859.78" dur="8.88">sixty dollars in today&amp;#39;s terms think</text>
  <text start="865.24" dur="6.36">about that for a second if you had gold</text>
  <text start="868.66" dur="8.4">and you were dealing with a quarter of</text>
  <text start="871.6" dur="7.11">gold and you had four gold quarters no</text>

  <text start="886.18" dur="4.62">that as 25 cents 25 cents 25 cents but</text>
  <text start="888.85" dur="7.55">if you look at those together that would</text>
  <text start="890.8" dur="9.3">be worth $1,200 the founding fathers</text>
  <text start="896.4" dur="8.17">wanted us to have real money they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="900.1" dur="6.78">want paper and ink which devalued every</text>
