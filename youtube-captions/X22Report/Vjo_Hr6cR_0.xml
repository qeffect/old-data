  <text start="246.81" dur="5.489">the people from the UK government and</text>
  <text start="249.239" dur="5.671">placed it with non elected leaders think</text>
  <text start="252.299" dur="5.701">about that for a second think of what</text>
  <text start="254.91" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;ve done now the people they voted</text>
  <text start="258" dur="5.66">in a referendum fair and square and they</text>
  <text start="260.25" dur="5.4">said listen we want to leave the EU and</text>
  <text start="263.66" dur="3.49">now they&amp;#39;re saying you know something</text>
  <text start="265.65" dur="4.37">because of what Teresa May and what</text>
  <text start="267.15" dur="6.06">you&amp;#39;ve done No Deal is the way to go</text>
  <text start="270.02" dur="6.519">Boris Johnson was elected because his</text>
  <text start="273.21" dur="6.51">promise was to leave the EU with a No</text>

  <text start="295.33" dur="6.329">will this work most likely not this will</text>
  <text start="298.96" dur="5.82">be a big fail just like everything else</text>
  <text start="301.659" dur="5.401">that we&amp;#39;ve seen yes the UK will</text>
  <text start="304.78" dur="5.009">eventually leave and this will be the</text>
  <text start="307.06" dur="5.46">destruction of the EU other countries</text>
  <text start="309.789" dur="4.981">will catch on Italy looking very closely</text>
  <text start="312.52" dur="4.829">at this hungry and the rest and saying</text>
  <text start="314.77" dur="5.16">hey let&amp;#39;s do it let&amp;#39;s see what happens</text>
  <text start="317.349" dur="4.79">here now we all know how the deep state</text>
  <text start="319.93" dur="5.31">works how the mainstream media works</text>
  <text start="322.139" dur="4.511">here in the United States and around the</text>
  <text start="325.24" dur="2.579">world but especially here in the United</text>
  <text start="326.65" dur="3.739">States to convince the American people</text>
  <text start="327.819" dur="7.231">of something that is not true</text>
  <text start="330.389" dur="8.83">think about this we know that if you</text>
  <text start="335.05" dur="6.329">repeat something enough times with many</text>
  <text start="339.219" dur="5.25">news outlets saying the same thing over</text>
  <text start="341.379" dur="5">and over and over well it convinces the</text>
  <text start="344.469" dur="5.401">people that it must be true then and</text>
  <text start="346.379" dur="5.981">then what do they normally do they put</text>
  <text start="349.87" dur="4.049">out surveys after this they magically</text>
  <text start="352.36" dur="3.839">appear to back up the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="353.919" dur="4.71">and to try to convince the people that</text>
  <text start="356.199" dur="3.931">look the majority the people are doing</text>
  <text start="358.629" dur="3.211">exactly what the mainstream media says</text>
  <text start="360.13" dur="4.11">and if a large number of people are</text>
  <text start="361.84" dur="4.53">saying it well then we must go along</text>
  <text start="364.24" dur="3.899">with it we can&amp;#39;t counter it that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="366.37" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;ve done this is the formula they</text>
  <text start="368.139" dur="5.101">always use and we see this happening</text>
  <text start="371.05" dur="4.109">right now that exact formula which is</text>
  <text start="373.24" dur="4.26">being used for the economy</text>
  <text start="375.159" dur="3.81">now the mainstream media they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="377.5" dur="4.59">pushing a recession is coming the</text>
  <text start="378.969" dur="5.221">recession is coming in 2020 all the news</text>
  <text start="382.09" dur="4.169">outlets got the talking points and they</text>
  <text start="384.19" dur="5.099">continued repeating this over and over</text>
  <text start="386.259" dur="5.25">and then we know what comes next</text>
  <text start="389.289" dur="4.261">it&amp;#39;s a survey to prove that the talking</text>
  <text start="391.509" dur="4.701">points are correct and the people</text>
  <text start="393.55" dur="6.51">believe there is a recession coming and</text>
  <text start="396.21" dur="6.91">who to blame so let&amp;#39;s go back to the</text>
  <text start="400.06" dur="5.34">first part here they had articles the</text>
  <text start="403.12" dur="6.12">mainstream media was repeating it that</text>
  <text start="405.4" dur="5.15">we&amp;#39;re heading into a 2020 recession over</text>
  <text start="409.24" dur="3.419">and over and over</text>
  <text start="410.55" dur="3.79">they knew that they only had a certain</text>
  <text start="412.659" dur="3.6">period of time to convince the people</text>
  <text start="414.34" dur="3.75">and we know that they started to</text>
  <text start="416.259" dur="5.13">backtrack a little bit here because we</text>
  <text start="418.09" dur="5.009">show these articles on Friday and all</text>
  <text start="421.389" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;ll have more of these articles to</text>
  <text start="423.099" dur="5.821">protect themselves but they&amp;#39;re gonna try</text>
  <text start="426.699" dur="5.191">to push this until the very end</text>
  <text start="428.92" dur="6.51">and what we see happening right now is a</text>
  <text start="431.89" dur="5.4">survey that came out to back that there</text>
  <text start="435.43" dur="4.17">is going to be a recession and if there</text>
  <text start="437.29" dur="8.07">is a recession the people are going to</text>
  <text start="439.6" dur="7.53">blame who Trump now we need to remember</text>
  <text start="445.36" dur="4.83">that Trump has been contradicting the</text>
  <text start="447.13" dur="5.4">Fed putting the blame on the Fed that if</text>
  <text start="450.19" dur="5.13">the Fed does not do what Trump wants the</text>
  <text start="452.53" dur="6.15">economy will fail but the survey</text>
  <text start="455.32" dur="6.9">actually protects the Fed and blames</text>
  <text start="458.68" dur="6.12">Trump now why would they do this because</text>
  <text start="462.22" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re trying to push the recession</text>
  <text start="464.8" dur="3.69">agenda because they don&amp;#39;t have control</text>
  <text start="467.08" dur="3.99">over the Fed anymore</text>
  <text start="468.49" dur="4.11">the Patriots do and the only way to</text>
  <text start="471.07" dur="4.23">cause a recession is to convince the</text>
  <text start="472.6" dur="5.22">people if the people live in fear of a</text>
  <text start="475.3" dur="4.59">recession they will not spend they will</text>
  <text start="477.82" dur="5.25">not make big purchases they will</text>
  <text start="479.89" dur="6.05">contract they will not expand and this</text>
  <text start="483.07" dur="7.14">is what they were hoping so this survey</text>
  <text start="485.94" dur="6.67">was produced right on schedule and this</text>
  <text start="490.21" dur="4.77">is according to a Harvard Harris Poll it</text>
  <text start="492.61" dur="4.62">says 57 percent of Americans would blame</text>
  <text start="494.98" dur="3.69">Trump if the u.s. led into a recession</text>
  <text start="497.23" dur="4.68">in the next year</text>
  <text start="498.67" dur="4.26">additionally they note that only 33</text>
  <text start="501.91" dur="3.39">percent said that the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="502.93" dur="4.08">Bank which influences the economy for</text>
  <text start="505.3" dur="4.71">example by setting the federal funds</text>
  <text start="507.01" dur="5.969">bank lending rate would be to blame so</text>
  <text start="510.01" dur="6.03">57% say Trump is to blame and only 33</text>
  <text start="512.979" dur="5.611">percent say the Fed is to blame and we</text>
  <text start="516.04" dur="4.92">know this is completely the opposite we</text>
  <text start="518.59" dur="5.37">know that Trump has been setting this up</text>
  <text start="520.96" dur="6.12">and we know that the people they</text>
  <text start="523.96" dur="6.48">understand that the Fed controls the</text>
  <text start="527.08" dur="5.76">economy the Fed is in control because</text>
  <text start="530.44" dur="4.86">this is an illusionary economy that they</text>
  <text start="532.84" dur="4.86">created its manipulated and Trump has</text>
  <text start="535.3" dur="4.38">been pointing out that listen every time</text>
  <text start="537.7" dur="3.93">I tell them to do something the economy</text>
  <text start="539.68" dur="5.4">does well when they don&amp;#39;t listen to me</text>
  <text start="541.63" dur="6.27">the economy does poorly but this survey</text>
  <text start="545.08" dur="7.53">is trying to flip it and this is right</text>
  <text start="547.9" dur="7.65">on schedule and we know that this is</text>
  <text start="552.61" dur="7.02">going to be a big fail they&amp;#39;re too late</text>
  <text start="555.55" dur="6.48">to the party why because they only have</text>
  <text start="559.63" dur="3.149">this small window to push the economy</text>
  <text start="562.03" dur="4.38">over the</text>
  <text start="562.779" dur="6.271">it has failed the Fed is already making</text>
  <text start="566.41" dur="4.95">plans to cut the rate the Fed has</text>
  <text start="569.05" dur="4.95">already purchased bonds the Fed is going</text>
  <text start="571.36" dur="5.58">to announce stimulus and we know in the</text>
  <text start="574" dur="5.699">beginning stages of this that when you</text>
  <text start="576.94" dur="4.53">lower rates what happens the economy</text>
  <text start="579.699" dur="3.781">takes off now I know the mainstream</text>
  <text start="581.47" dur="3.45">media was out there and they were trying</text>
  <text start="583.48" dur="4.56">to convince everyone if the rates are</text>
  <text start="584.92" dur="5.039">cut we&amp;#39;re gonna go into a recession well</text>
  <text start="588.04" dur="3.419">actually no it is the opposite of what</text>
  <text start="589.959" dur="3.151">they&amp;#39;re saying and we&amp;#39;ve said this for a</text>
  <text start="591.459" dur="3.901">very long time it&amp;#39;s always the opposite</text>
  <text start="593.11" dur="4.89">of what they say when they increase the</text>
  <text start="595.36" dur="4.86">rates they hit a tipping point and that</text>
  <text start="598" dur="5.399">causes the domino effect and then they</text>
  <text start="600.22" dur="5.82">quickly lower the rates again they</text>
  <text start="603.399" dur="4.68">flipped it and why did they do this</text>
  <text start="606.04" dur="4.349">because they&amp;#39;re trying to convince the</text>
  <text start="608.079" dur="4.741">people that if the Fed listens the Trump</text>
  <text start="610.389" dur="4.621">we&amp;#39;re gonna head into a recession and by</text>
  <text start="612.82" dur="3.449">putting out these articles over and over</text>
  <text start="615.01" dur="3.36">and over a mentioning in the mainstream</text>
  <text start="616.269" dur="5.791">media they&amp;#39;re trying to force the</text>
  <text start="618.37" dur="6.779">recession and they know that once they</text>
  <text start="622.06" dur="5.13">cut the rates and stimulus starts the</text>
  <text start="625.149" dur="4.021">economy will not go into a recession</text>
  <text start="627.19" dur="3.72">this is why we already saw these</text>
  <text start="629.17" dur="2.729">articles where they&amp;#39;re backtracking a</text>
  <text start="630.91" dur="4.59">little bit they&amp;#39;re trying to cover</text>
  <text start="631.899" dur="4.8">themselves because once it happens Trump</text>
  <text start="635.5" dur="4.949">of the Patriots they know they have a</text>
  <text start="636.699" dur="7.291">short period of time before the economy</text>
  <text start="640.449" dur="5.521">really starts to suffer and the short</text>

  <text start="645.97" dur="6.929">Patriots to get reelected once again and</text>
