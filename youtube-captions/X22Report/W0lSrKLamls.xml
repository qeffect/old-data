  <text start="61.65" dur="5.81">September 29 2017 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="64.89" dur="6.93">episode is if the economy has recovered</text>
  <text start="67.46" dur="6.79">why did this just happen let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="71.82" dur="4.89">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="74.25" dur="5.04">we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on student loans</text>
  <text start="76.71" dur="3.93">the housing market for quite a while</text>
  <text start="79.29" dur="3.689">especially when the corporate media</text>
  <text start="80.64" dur="4.02">wasn&amp;#39;t talking about it at all and now</text>
  <text start="82.979" dur="3.841">we see there are signs that the</text>
  <text start="84.66" dur="5.04">corporate media they need to acknowledge</text>
  <text start="86.82" dur="4.65">that things well they&amp;#39;re not going as</text>
  <text start="89.7" dur="4.14">well as they&amp;#39;ve been telling us and</text>
  <text start="91.47" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re starting to report on things</text>
  <text start="93.84" dur="3.57">that are you know imploding on</text>
  <text start="95.91" dur="4.47">themselves like the student loan market</text>
  <text start="97.41" dur="4.44">for instance now student loan defaults</text>
  <text start="100.38" dur="2.97">they are on the rise now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="101.85" dur="2.85">talking about this for quite a while now</text>
  <text start="103.35" dur="5.97">the corporate media is out there and</text>
  <text start="104.7" dur="6.99">they&amp;#39;ve cited that yes there has been an</text>
  <text start="109.32" dur="4.17">uptick because the Department of</text>
  <text start="111.69" dur="3.87">Education came out with a report saying</text>
  <text start="113.49" dur="3.72">that yes student loan default they are</text>
  <text start="115.56" dur="3.809">on the rise now the Department of</text>
  <text start="117.21" dur="4.11">Education side of that 11.5 percent of</text>
  <text start="119.369" dur="3.481">the 5 million borrowers who started</text>
  <text start="121.32" dur="2.159">repaying federal loans in October of</text>
  <text start="122.85" dur="4.05">2013</text>
  <text start="123.479" dur="4.89">defaulted by September of 2016 the</text>
  <text start="126.9" dur="5.88">proportion of borrowers who defaulted</text>
  <text start="128.369" dur="7.501">Prok prior to this report was 11.3% so</text>
  <text start="132.78" dur="4.65">it increased by 0.2 percent now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="135.87" dur="3.63">been watching the student loan market</text>
  <text start="137.43" dur="3.839">and we need to understand that the</text>
  <text start="139.5" dur="3.93">government well they had to manipulate</text>
  <text start="141.269" dur="4.411">these numbers in a way to make it look</text>
  <text start="143.43" dur="3.57">like that yeah this isn&amp;#39;t as bad as it</text>
  <text start="145.68" dur="2.339">really is now remember all these</text>
  <text start="147" dur="4.049">individuals that have been going to</text>
  <text start="148.019" dur="5.161">college there have been problems it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="151.049" dur="3.961">very difficult to get a job or a high</text>
  <text start="153.18" dur="3.869">paying job and I know many individuals</text>
  <text start="155.01" dur="4.59">who have been writing in and I know from</text>
  <text start="157.049" dur="5.491">family members where they still can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="159.6" dur="4.919">find work yes you can go to college you</text>
  <text start="162.54" dur="3.56">can put yourself into debt but if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="164.519" dur="4.111">not going for something very very very</text>
  <text start="166.1" dur="4.96">specific and you&amp;#39;re just going for a BA</text>
  <text start="168.63" dur="5.639">or a BS coming out of school you really</text>
  <text start="171.06" dur="4.769">have no experience in anything yes you</text>
  <text start="174.269" dur="3.331">might be able to get a low-paying job or</text>
  <text start="175.829" dur="5.041">maybe you&amp;#39;ll have to intern but many</text>
  <text start="177.6" dur="4.41">people they can&amp;#39;t really find any work</text>
  <text start="180.87" dur="3.06">and this is why they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="182.01" dur="4.87">part-time jobs this is why we&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="183.93" dur="5.02">these kids live with their parents</text>
  <text start="186.88" dur="4.11">longer and longer and longer because</text>
  <text start="188.95" dur="4.47">they just can&amp;#39;t find the work so what</text>
  <text start="190.99" dur="4.56">the government is done is since they</text>
  <text start="193.42" dur="3.75">can&amp;#39;t find work they say okay how much</text>
  <text start="195.55" dur="3.03">are you making oh you&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="197.17" dur="3.33">part-time at this job you&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="198.58" dur="4.23">part-time at this job you&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="200.5" dur="4.2">$20,000 a year so what we&amp;#39;ll do is we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="202.81" dur="4.47">modify your student loan to the amount</text>
  <text start="204.7" dur="5.61">that you&amp;#39;re making spread it over 25 30</text>
  <text start="207.28" dur="5.4">years and this will be your payback even</text>
  <text start="210.31" dur="4.41">as they&amp;#39;re doing this it&amp;#39;s becoming more</text>
  <text start="212.68" dur="4.65">and more difficult for these individuals</text>
  <text start="214.72" dur="4.74">to pay back their student loans and can</text>
  <text start="217.33" dur="4.32">you imagine if the interest rate started</text>
  <text start="219.46" dur="6.18">to move up it would be a complete and</text>
  <text start="221.65" dur="6.66">utter disaster now we see that consumer</text>
  <text start="225.64" dur="4.77">confidence it is dropping right now and</text>
  <text start="228.31" dur="4.89">America&amp;#39;s confidence in the economy well</text>
  <text start="230.41" dur="4.41">it&amp;#39;s starting to falter right now and</text>
  <text start="233.2" dur="2.61">we&amp;#39;re seeing that many individuals are</text>
  <text start="234.82" dur="3.36">looking at this and saying you know</text>
  <text start="235.81" dur="4.98">something the home buying conditions</text>
  <text start="238.18" dur="6.45">they&amp;#39;re not as favorable as they were</text>
  <text start="240.79" dur="5.67">five years ago and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="244.63" dur="3.75">interesting about this is that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="246.46" dur="5.01">telling us how great the market is and</text>
  <text start="248.38" dur="6.9">if you go back all the way to 2010 2011</text>
  <text start="251.47" dur="6.72">we are at that point now in 2013 2014</text>
  <text start="255.28" dur="4.35">2015 people believed the hype that the</text>
  <text start="258.19" dur="3.6">housing market was bouncing back</text>
  <text start="259.63" dur="5.28">everything was great and there were no</text>
  <text start="261.79" dur="5.61">bubbles to be found even two years ago</text>
  <text start="264.91" dur="4.08">UBS came out and they looked at the</text>
  <text start="267.4" dur="2.82">world&amp;#39;s most expensive housing market</text>
  <text start="268.99" dur="5.16">and have found that London and Hong Kong</text>
  <text start="270.22" dur="6.53">were the only two areas where they might</text>
  <text start="274.15" dur="4.2">be at risk of being in a bubble</text>
  <text start="276.75" dur="5.52">fast-forward to today</text>
  <text start="278.35" dur="6.75">guess what things have radically changed</text>
  <text start="282.27" dur="4.93">now UBS is looking and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="285.1" dur="3.54">okay we&amp;#39;re having we&amp;#39;re I mean we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="287.2" dur="4.94">looking at many different areas like</text>
  <text start="288.64" dur="6.74">Munich Amsterdam London Paris Geneva</text>
  <text start="292.14" dur="7.45">we&amp;#39;re going to Sydney Hong Kong</text>
  <text start="295.38" dur="5.65">Stockholm Canada Toronto Vancouver in</text>
  <text start="299.59" dur="4.32">the United States San Francisco Los</text>
  <text start="301.03" dur="4.98">Angeles Boston New York Miami Chicago</text>
  <text start="303.91" dur="3.27">and you can see especially in the United</text>
  <text start="306.01" dur="2.91">States these are the cities that Case</text>
  <text start="307.18" dur="3.48">Shiller looks at and this is the places</text>
  <text start="308.92" dur="2.73">where they pumped up the bubbles but we</text>
  <text start="310.66" dur="3.06">can see that they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="311.65" dur="4.829">recognize that there&amp;#39;s a lot of bubbles</text>
  <text start="313.72" dur="6.449">happening right now and we know why this</text>
  <text start="316.479" dur="5.791">is because they needed to push the</text>
  <text start="320.169" dur="4.141">system up they needed to push the</text>
  <text start="322.27" dur="4.169">housing market globally up because when</text>
  <text start="324.31" dur="3.719">people feel like their house is worth</text>
  <text start="326.439" dur="2.19">more they feel good about it it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="328.029" dur="3.841">on paper</text>
  <text start="328.629" dur="5.37">because you only get that money if you</text>
  <text start="331.87" dur="3.299">sell your house so everything that</text>
  <text start="333.999" dur="2.73">you&amp;#39;re looking at is on paper just like</text>
  <text start="335.169" dur="3.36">the stock market oh look my stocks went</text>
  <text start="336.729" dur="3.631">up mom they really didn&amp;#39;t go anywhere</text>
  <text start="338.529" dur="3.75">until you sell it because they could be</text>
  <text start="340.36" dur="4.32">up today tomorrow they could be down and</text>
  <text start="342.279" dur="4.32">guess what you really didn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="344.68" dur="3.989">anything because you store holding that</text>
  <text start="346.599" dur="4.741">paper and it&amp;#39;s losing value now same</text>
  <text start="348.669" dur="5.61">thing with houses yes you have a house</text>
  <text start="351.34" dur="4.889">but if the market crashes tomorrow guess</text>
  <text start="354.279" dur="4.16">what all those people who bought in the</text>
  <text start="356.229" dur="7.59">hand the height of the housing market in</text>
  <text start="358.439" dur="7.51">2006-2007 today they&amp;#39;re still below what</text>
  <text start="363.819" dur="6.21">they paid for it so they didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="365.949" dur="6.601">recoup that money and we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="370.029" dur="6.271">many of these areas they are in bubbles</text>
  <text start="372.55" dur="5.519">right now and guess what when the system</text>
  <text start="376.3" dur="3.869">comes down and the houses start to crash</text>
  <text start="378.069" dur="3.6">which we&amp;#39;re going to see because wolf</text>
  <text start="380.169" dur="3.12">Richter he laid it out in all the</text>
  <text start="381.669" dur="4.53">different cities showing that we are way</text>
  <text start="383.289" dur="6.78">above the housing bubbles that we were</text>
  <text start="386.199" dur="6.99">in back in 2007-2008 we know we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="390.069" dur="4.171">for a major major disaster now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="393.189" dur="2.4">been hearing all in the corporate media</text>
  <text start="394.24" dur="3.419">and Trump is out there telling us how</text>
  <text start="395.589" dur="5.971">great the economy is that GDP is gonna</text>
  <text start="397.659" dur="7.051">be 3% and the markets going up the</text>
  <text start="401.56" dur="5.609">question is all the soft data is telling</text>
  <text start="404.71" dur="6.6">us that yes the economy is doing better</text>
  <text start="407.169" dur="6.87">but the hard data will guess what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="411.31" dur="5.879">collapsing and it&amp;#39;s collapsed to its</text>
  <text start="414.039" dur="5.041">weakest point since February of 2009 and</text>
  <text start="417.189" dur="4.891">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this is</text>
  <text start="419.08" dur="6.69">that this is the six monthly drop in</text>
  <text start="422.08" dur="6.66">hard economic data in a row something</text>
  <text start="425.77" dur="6.359">that has never happened before unless we</text>
  <text start="428.74" dur="5.909">look back guess what in the time that</text>
  <text start="432.129" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;re in the Great Recession of 2006</text>
  <text start="434.649" dur="6.061">2007 2008 here we&amp;#39;re supposed to be in a</text>
  <text start="437.529" dur="6.991">recovery and we can see that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="440.71" dur="6.539">hard economic data well it&amp;#39;s not doing</text>
  <text start="444.52" dur="4.769">what the survey data the soft data is</text>
  <text start="447.249" dur="4.85">doing because the hard eight is the real</text>
  <text start="449.289" dur="4.801">data and we&amp;#39;ve been following this and</text>
  <text start="452.099" dur="4.811">we have been seeing</text>
  <text start="454.09" dur="4.049">that the real economic data am i talking</text>
  <text start="456.91" dur="3.66">about the manipulation that the</text>
  <text start="458.139" dur="4.351">government spin puts a spin on all the</text>
  <text start="460.57" dur="3.72">data that they put out there same thing</text>
  <text start="462.49" dur="4.2">with the Fed I&amp;#39;m talking about what you</text>
  <text start="464.29" dur="4.56">see with your eyes what you notice out</text>
  <text start="466.69" dur="5.91">there what people are talking about</text>
  <text start="468.85" dur="6.15">because this is what&amp;#39;s real I mean if</text>
  <text start="472.6" dur="3.78">you have an economy and every the news</text>
  <text start="475" dur="3.06">the corporate media is out there telling</text>
  <text start="476.38" dur="3.48">us that you know unemployment at four</text>
  <text start="478.06" dur="4.109">something percent the stock market&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="479.86" dur="3.779">going up yes you can believe those</text>
  <text start="482.169" dur="3.301">numbers but then you start to walk</text>
  <text start="483.639" dur="4.681">around and saying okay that stores gone</text>
  <text start="485.47" dur="4.44">that stores gone all these houses are</text>
  <text start="488.32" dur="3.9">for sale no one&amp;#39;s coming to buy these</text>
  <text start="489.91" dur="3.54">houses I look online and I see that they</text>
  <text start="492.22" dur="2.64">have dropped their housing prices</text>
  <text start="493.45" dur="3.45">something&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="494.86" dur="3.99">something&amp;#39;s not right the foot traffic</text>
  <text start="496.9" dur="3.84">in restaurants when you go into them</text>
  <text start="498.85" dur="2.19">they&amp;#39;re not as packed that they used to</text>
  <text start="500.74" dur="2.31">be</text>
  <text start="501.04" dur="3.98">am I talking about happy hour during the</text>
  <text start="503.05" dur="3.869">bar hours I&amp;#39;m talking about the everyday</text>
  <text start="505.02" dur="3.04">restaurant where you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="506.919" dur="3.331">serving food and things like that</text>
  <text start="508.06" dur="4.2">because I&amp;#39;ve noticed that when you go</text>
  <text start="510.25" dur="4.77">into these restaurants they&amp;#39;re not as</text>
  <text start="512.26" dur="4.86">packed as they used to be and the</text>
  <text start="515.02" dur="4.67">restaurant performance index is showing</text>
  <text start="517.12" dur="6.51">that people are not going to these areas</text>
  <text start="519.69" dur="6.28">to spend their money on food anymore and</text>
  <text start="523.63" dur="5.22">we can see this is happening to many</text>
  <text start="525.97" dur="5.7">different areas and it is spreading it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="528.85" dur="4.26">not improving everything is not getting</text>
  <text start="531.67" dur="3.63">better just like they told us that</text>
  <text start="533.11" dur="3.39">retail is going to bounce back the if</text>

  <text start="536.5" dur="3.51">season is going to be pretty darn good</text>
  <text start="537.85" dur="3.63">they feel that this holiday season</text>
  <text start="540.01" dur="3.57">things are going to bounce back really</text>
  <text start="541.48" dur="4.89">with thousands and thousands of stores</text>
  <text start="543.58" dur="5.82">closing with more and more people losing</text>
  <text start="546.37" dur="6.33">their job the retail industry is just</text>
  <text start="549.4" dur="3.93">going to bounce back does that make any</text>
  <text start="552.7" dur="4.32">sense</text>
  <text start="553.33" dur="5.009">no it doesn&amp;#39;t people are going to say ok</text>
  <text start="557.02" dur="3.66">we got to do something for the holiday</text>
  <text start="558.339" dur="3.75">season yes they will purchase but</text>
  <text start="560.68" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re not going to purchase as much as</text>
  <text start="562.089" dur="4.261">they normally do because people are</text>
  <text start="564.31" dur="4.44">nervous they&amp;#39;re afraid they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="566.35" dur="5.16">if their jobs going to be there now</text>
  <text start="568.75" dur="6.959">Fitch has downgraded Deutsche Bank to be</text>
  <text start="571.51" dur="6.93">b+ triple B plus from a minus and what</text>
  <text start="575.709" dur="4.88">they&amp;#39;re saying right now is that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="578.44" dur="6.69">a lot of pressure on their earnings and</text>
  <text start="580.589" dur="6.161">they don&amp;#39;t see the recovery of the bank</text>
  <text start="585.13" dur="2.42">they&amp;#39;re saying the revenue that the bank</text>
  <text start="586.75" dur="2.87">is bringing in</text>
  <text start="587.55" dur="4.53">well it&amp;#39;s not going to happen in the</text>
  <text start="589.62" dur="6.089">next couple of years and there and</text>
  <text start="592.08" dur="6.84">they&amp;#39;re seeing that that this revenue</text>
