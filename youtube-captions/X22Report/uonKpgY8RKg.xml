  <text start="96.159" dur="5.761">collapse financial news now when we look</text>
  <text start="98.979" dur="4.56">at many of the economic sectors before</text>
  <text start="101.92" dur="3.54">the election after the election we saw</text>
  <text start="103.539" dur="4.08">this Trump euphoria where things just</text>
  <text start="105.46" dur="3.99">bounced up out of nowhere for no</text>
  <text start="107.619" dur="4.89">apparent reason was a lot of soft data</text>
  <text start="109.45" dur="4.459">that was moving up very very quickly and</text>
  <text start="112.509" dur="3.29">everyone was out there saying well</text>
  <text start="113.909" dur="4.06">everything&amp;#39;s getting back to normal</text>
  <text start="115.799" dur="5.14">everything is fine the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="117.969" dur="4.83">well well how possibly can that be it</text>
  <text start="120.939" dur="4.14">doesn&amp;#39;t even make sense Trump didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="122.799" dur="5.1">even do anything nothing was changed in</text>
  <text start="125.079" dur="6.03">the economy no regulations were changed</text>
  <text start="127.899" dur="5.221">there was no new economic policy yes</text>
  <text start="131.109" dur="3.511">there were promises about jobs about</text>
  <text start="133.12" dur="3.839">bringing back manufacturing but it</text>
  <text start="134.62" dur="4.32">wasn&amp;#39;t actually done I mean it was great</text>
  <text start="136.959" dur="4.471">for publicity it was great for headlines</text>
  <text start="138.94" dur="4.68">it sounded really good it allowed the</text>
  <text start="141.43" dur="4.02">stock market to rise and remember the</text>
  <text start="143.62" dur="3.209">stock market just rising for absolutely</text>
  <text start="145.45" dur="3.96">no reason it&amp;#39;s not based on anything</text>
  <text start="146.829" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s completely manipulated and what</text>
  <text start="149.41" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is things have</text>
  <text start="151.359" dur="5.401">dramatically changed that little dead</text>
  <text start="153.85" dur="5.13">cat bounce that everyone was all hyped</text>
  <text start="156.76" dur="5.069">up about things are changing rapidly</text>
  <text start="158.98" dur="4.95">what do I mean well yesterday we talked</text>
  <text start="161.829" dur="4.321">about it how all of a sudden things</text>
  <text start="163.93" dur="4.26">started to go the opposite way today we</text>
  <text start="166.15" dur="4.679">see building permits well during</text>
  <text start="168.19" dur="4.889">January&amp;#39;s Trump bump building permits in</text>
  <text start="170.829" dur="4.171">February they plunged by six point two</text>
  <text start="173.079" dur="4.681">percent on-month a month this is the</text>
  <text start="175" dur="5.43">biggest drop since March 2016 so we had</text>
  <text start="177.76" dur="4.12">a little Trump bump in January come</text>
  <text start="180.43" dur="4.9">februari thing</text>
  <text start="181.88" dur="6.51">are back to normal we see a tumble in</text>
  <text start="185.33" dur="5.55">multifamily units also I mean things are</text>
  <text start="188.39" dur="4.29">going the opposite way right now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="190.88" dur="4.95">not going in the same direction anymore</text>
  <text start="192.68" dur="5.97">things have dramatically changed and it</text>
  <text start="195.83" dur="5.16">appears now that home builders are mil</text>
  <text start="198.65" dur="5.16">more willing to talk about how great</text>
  <text start="200.99" dur="5.88">things are compared to how things really</text>
  <text start="203.81" dur="4.86">are I mean home builder optimism yeah</text>
  <text start="206.87" dur="3.69">they can be very optimistic but when you</text>
  <text start="208.67" dur="3.9">see housing starts building permits</text>
  <text start="210.56" dur="4.26">sales of homes going the opposite</text>
  <text start="212.57" dur="3.6">direction optimism is meaningless if</text>
  <text start="214.82" dur="4.26">this because there&amp;#39;s nothing to back it</text>
  <text start="216.17" dur="4.98">up we see this filly said well the soft</text>
  <text start="219.08" dur="3.78">data it was moving up and up and up and</text>
  <text start="221.15" dur="3.57">all of a sudden it snapped it&amp;#39;s heading</text>
  <text start="222.86" dur="3.66">down once again but when we look at the</text>
  <text start="224.72" dur="3.81">hard data the hard data on the philly</text>
  <text start="226.52" dur="4.41">fed in every what never went anywhere</text>
  <text start="228.53" dur="4.68">now the Philly shred just dropped most</text>
  <text start="230.93" dur="4.8">in 11 months and the cracks in the</text>
  <text start="233.21" dur="4.83">sentiment are starting to show philly</text>
  <text start="235.73" dur="4.53">fed&amp;#39;s business outlook tumbled from 33</text>
  <text start="238.04" dur="6.27">year highs in March falling the most</text>
  <text start="240.26" dur="6">since march of 2016 prices paid surge in</text>
  <text start="244.31" dur="4.26">March as new orders stagnated and</text>
  <text start="246.26" dur="5.31">general business activity tumbled so</text>
  <text start="248.57" dur="5.88">post Trump rise it&amp;#39;s starting to stall</text>
  <text start="251.57" dur="6.45">right now now Goldman is out there and</text>
  <text start="254.45" dur="6.27">they are warning that trumps budget well</text>
  <text start="258.02" dur="5.31">there&amp;#39;s not much to it and when we look</text>
  <text start="260.72" dur="6.3">at it we can see there&amp;#39;s a lot missing</text>
  <text start="263.33" dur="5.37">like the fiscal projections and no</text>
  <text start="267.02" dur="3.42">discussion of tax reform or</text>
  <text start="268.7" dur="3.45">infrastructure plans which the White</text>
  <text start="270.44" dur="3.78">House says will be released in coming</text>
  <text start="272.15" dur="4.35">months likely as a part of a full budget</text>
  <text start="274.22" dur="5.25">submission to Congress that we expect to</text>
  <text start="276.5" dur="4.62">be released around May it also includes</text>
  <text start="279.47" dur="4.29">no discussion of the Obamacare</text>
  <text start="281.12" dur="4.56">replacement plan at all now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="283.76" dur="3.12">interesting about all this you scratch</text>
  <text start="285.68" dur="2.7">your head and you say okay you really</text>
  <text start="286.88" dur="3.39">didn&amp;#39;t come up with anything think about</text>
  <text start="288.38" dur="3.69">why why wouldn&amp;#39;t he come up with</text>
  <text start="290.27" dur="3.9">anything right now why is he putting it</text>
  <text start="292.07" dur="3.99">off why didn&amp;#39;t he put any projections in</text>
  <text start="294.17" dur="3.18">there wyd need to talk about the</text>
  <text start="296.06" dur="3.78">infrastructure spending in the tax</text>
  <text start="297.35" dur="4.5">reforms well remember what the central</text>
  <text start="299.84" dur="3.81">bank is doing right now the Fed they</text>
  <text start="301.85" dur="4.26">just raised the rates there&amp;#39;s a reason</text>
  <text start="303.65" dur="5.1">for it nothing happened by mistake their</text>
  <text start="306.11" dur="5.34">goal right now is to bring down the</text>
  <text start="308.75" dur="4.169">market your goal right now is to crash</text>
  <text start="311.45" dur="3.82">this and they already started the</text>
  <text start="312.919" dur="5.911">process that was phase 3 your move</text>
  <text start="315.27" dur="6.63">to face for and they need Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="318.83" dur="6.19">economic policy his budget plan they</text>
  <text start="321.9" dur="5.28">need it to be in place right now because</text>
  <text start="325.02" dur="4.05">this way once it&amp;#39;s in place and</text>
  <text start="327.18" dur="4.71">everything&amp;#39;s all set and done they can</text>
  <text start="329.07" dur="4.68">say okay we are now on Trump&amp;#39;s plan but</text>
  <text start="331.89" dur="3.99">he hasn&amp;#39;t done this yet he&amp;#39;s putting it</text>
  <text start="333.75" dur="4.56">off there&amp;#39;s a reason for it because he</text>
  <text start="335.88" dur="4.17">understands what the central bank is up</text>
  <text start="338.31" dur="5.4">to something very interesting today</text>
  <text start="340.05" dur="6.6">Trump visited the site of Andrew Jackson</text>
  <text start="343.71" dur="5.46">he also has andrew jackson hanging on</text>
  <text start="346.65" dur="5.16">the wall behind him and we know what</text>
  <text start="349.17" dur="5.52">Andrew Jackson did he removed the</text>
  <text start="351.81" dur="4.68">central bank and this is why the central</text>
  <text start="354.69" dur="3.3">bankers wanted to remove andrew jackson</text>
  <text start="356.49" dur="2.97">from twenty dollar bill they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="357.99" dur="3.81">to wipe out the history of what he</text>
  <text start="359.46" dur="5.46">actually did and what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="361.8" dur="6.15">is that he is continually bringing up</text>
  <text start="364.92" dur="6.21">andrew jackson visiting andrew jackson</text>
  <text start="367.95" dur="5.79">which is kind of a message that he sent</text>
  <text start="371.13" dur="5.1">me sending it to the central bank I know</text>
  <text start="373.74" dur="5.37">what you up to and my goal right now is</text>
  <text start="376.23" dur="5.07">to remove the central bank to take</text>
  <text start="379.11" dur="4.29">control of the century bike now he might</text>
  <text start="381.3" dur="4.71">not remove it completely he might just</text>
  <text start="383.4" dur="5.07">take control of it just like Putin has</text>
  <text start="386.01" dur="4.47">taken control of the central bank he</text>
  <text start="388.47" dur="3.63">dictates what the central bank will do</text>
  <text start="390.48" dur="4.68">could be better if we got rid of it</text>
  <text start="392.1" dur="6.45">altogether that would be the wise choice</text>
  <text start="395.16" dur="6.15">but we see right now that at this point</text>
  <text start="398.55" dur="4.38">there&amp;#39;s a power play going on and</text>
  <text start="401.31" dur="3.54">remember we&amp;#39;re still looking at his</text>
  <text start="402.93" dur="4.92">actions there are certain actions where</text>
  <text start="404.85" dur="5.34">the deep state the neocons they have</text>
  <text start="407.85" dur="4.32">taken control over certain areas there</text>
  <text start="410.19" dur="4.98">are other actions that he is doing that</text>
  <text start="412.17" dur="4.77">he&amp;#39;s trying to maneuver a way of taking</text>
  <text start="415.17" dur="5.28">control of the central bank so there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="416.94" dur="5.97">huge battle going on right now and it</text>
  <text start="420.45" dur="4.95">all depends on who&amp;#39;s stronger who has</text>
  <text start="422.91" dur="4.62">the ability to withstand who has the</text>
  <text start="425.4" dur="5.37">ability to say this is the way it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="427.53" dur="5.07">going to be is he strong enough to fight</text>
  <text start="430.77" dur="4.14">the deep state the neocons in the</text>
  <text start="432.6" dur="4.92">central bank or is he going to fold and</text>
  <text start="434.91" dur="4.59">completely give in this is what we are</text>
  <text start="437.52" dur="5.76">looking for but when we look at the Fed</text>
  <text start="439.5" dur="5.97">rate hike they&amp;#39;ve done this into a very</text>
  <text start="443.28" dur="4.38">weak economy actually an economy that is</text>
  <text start="445.47" dur="3.21">completely made up of illusionary</text>
  <text start="447.66" dur="3.27">numbers</text>
  <text start="448.68" dur="4.56">and when we start to look at what</text>
  <text start="450.93" dur="5.459">they&amp;#39;ve done here we see that it makes</text>
  <text start="453.24" dur="5.76">no sense to raise the rates right now</text>
  <text start="456.389" dur="4.891">because if we go back in time the</text>
  <text start="459" dur="4.199">economy was a lot better off during</text>
  <text start="461.28" dur="4.05">different periods in 2016 and it is</text>
  <text start="463.199" dur="3.631">today now when the Fed announce this</text>
  <text start="465.33" dur="3.839">rate hike we&amp;#39;ve discussed this yesterday</text>
  <text start="466.83" dur="4.47">the Atlanta side came out with their GDP</text>
  <text start="469.169" dur="4.56">growth of point nine percent which is</text>
  <text start="471.3" dur="4.619">absolutely awful and if that projection</text>
  <text start="473.729" dur="4.921">turns out to be accurate and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="475.919" dur="4.081">the GDP number is well this will be the</text>
  <text start="478.65" dur="4.68">weakest quarter of economic growth</text>
  <text start="480" dur="5.97">during which rate hikes were hiked in 37</text>
  <text start="483.33" dur="4.53">years we see the flow of credit is more</text>
  <text start="485.97" dur="4.44">critical to our economy than ever before</text>
  <text start="487.86" dur="4.41">and higher rates will mean higher</text>
  <text start="490.41" dur="4.77">interest payments on adjustable rate</text>
  <text start="492.27" dur="5.07">mortgages auto loans credit cards and</text>
  <text start="495.18" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;re already seeing it in the housing</text>
  <text start="497.34" dur="4.53">market mortgage rates jumped the number</text>
  <text start="499.83" dur="3.99">of people defaulting on them had already</text>
  <text start="501.87" dur="4.109">been rising now it&amp;#39;s going to rise even</text>
  <text start="503.82" dur="5.04">faster higher rates will likely</text>
  <text start="505.979" dur="4.44">accelerate the ongoing retail apocalypse</text>
  <text start="508.86" dur="4.53">because we know there&amp;#39;s a lot of money</text>
  <text start="510.419" dur="4.29">coming due very soon we also recently</text>
  <text start="513.39" dur="3.18">learned that the number of distress</text>
  <text start="514.709" dur="4.681">retailers United States is now at the</text>
  <text start="516.57" dur="5.01">highest level that we&amp;#39;ve been in since</text>
  <text start="519.39" dur="4.889">the last recession most American</text>
  <text start="521.58" dur="5.43">individuals cannot write a check for</text>
  <text start="524.279" dur="4.321">five hundred dollars or more and if</text>
  <text start="527.01" dur="3.39">credit card rates go up and people are</text>
  <text start="528.6" dur="3.6">using the credit card rate credit cards</text>
  <text start="530.4" dur="4.62">to make purchases and to live off of</text>
  <text start="532.2" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s going to be even more difficult the</text>
  <text start="535.02" dur="4.56">bond market is already crashing most</text>
  <text start="537.45" dur="4.56">observers only watch stocks but the</text>
  <text start="539.58" dur="4.86">truth is a bond crash almost always</text>
  <text start="542.01" dur="4.17">comes before stock market crash bonds</text>
  <text start="544.44" dur="4.17">had been falling like a rock since</text>
  <text start="546.18" dur="4.95">Trump&amp;#39;s election and we&amp;#39;re not too far</text>
  <text start="548.61" dur="4.32">away from a full-blown crisis and then</text>
  <text start="551.13" dur="3.75">we have a debt ceiling not too much</text>
  <text start="552.93" dur="3.99">about the debt ceiling in the corporate</text>
  <text start="554.88" dur="6.24">media but the suspension of the debt</text>
  <text start="556.92" dur="6.27">ceiling has ended and to raise the debt</text>
  <text start="561.12" dur="4.29">ceiling well there&amp;#39;s going to be you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="563.19" dur="4.8">going to need about 218 votes in the</text>
  <text start="565.41" dur="4.38">House of Representatives and we know</text>
  <text start="567.99" dur="4.589">that the Treasury&amp;#39;s cash balance is</text>
  <text start="569.79" dur="5.28">going to run out most likely by Memorial</text>
  <text start="572.579" dur="5.101">Day and the government right now is not</text>
  <text start="575.07" dur="3.81">bringing in enough revenue because it</text>
  <text start="577.68" dur="4.44">just experienced the largest decline</text>
  <text start="578.88" dur="3.42">since the last financial crisis so what</text>
  <text start="582.12" dur="2.22">we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="582.3" dur="5.25">seeing right now is we&amp;#39;re in a really</text>
  <text start="584.34" dur="5.55">bad position so what Janet Yellen the</text>
  <text start="587.55" dur="6.93">central bankers have just done is they</text>
  <text start="589.89" dur="6.06">raised rates and a very weak economy now</text>
  <text start="594.48" dur="3.24">we know that the Fed doesn&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="595.95" dur="3.93">GDP growth because they would have done</text>
  <text start="597.72" dur="4.68">this back during the election period of</text>
  <text start="599.88" dur="4.77">time when gdp was three percent or when</text>
  <text start="602.4" dur="4.47">it was 2.1 percent previous to that the</text>
  <text start="604.65" dur="5.22">question is why would the Fed want to</text>
  <text start="606.87" dur="5.85">hike twice in three months during a sub</text>
  <text start="609.87" dur="5.25">two percent gdp growth listen to the</text>
  <text start="612.72" dur="4.56">simple answer is stop right now that the</text>
