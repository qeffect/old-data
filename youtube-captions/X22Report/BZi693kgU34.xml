  <text start="55.23" dur="5.31">october 26 2016 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="58.29" dur="4.86">episode is another confirmation that the</text>
  <text start="60.54" dur="5.82">economy is in a recession and collapsing</text>
  <text start="63.15" dur="6.03">quickly let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="66.36" dur="4.47">collapse financial news now for the past</text>
  <text start="69.18" dur="3.33">couple of weeks leading up to this</text>
  <text start="70.83" dur="3.48">election time we&amp;#39;re seeing that the</text>
  <text start="72.51" dur="4.08">stock market is going absolutely nowhere</text>
  <text start="74.31" dur="3.63">but we have been seeing that more and</text>
  <text start="76.59" dur="3.08">more companies are laying off people</text>
  <text start="77.94" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re seeing that General Dynamics</text>
  <text start="79.67" dur="5.44">they&amp;#39;re laying off 700 people by January</text>
  <text start="82.77" dur="3.48">gannett they can be laying off about two</text>
  <text start="85.11" dur="2.399">percent of their work for us that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="86.25" dur="3.78">about three hundred and fifty plus</text>
  <text start="87.509" dur="5.731">people and when we look at these</text>
  <text start="90.03" dur="5.55">economic indicators we are seeing that</text>
  <text start="93.24" dur="5.64">these economic indicators they are</text>
  <text start="95.58" dur="5.7">pointing to a recession and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="98.88" dur="4.98">pointing to a collapse we are in a</text>
  <text start="101.28" dur="3.81">recession at this point because when we</text>
  <text start="103.86" dur="3.3">look at these different economic</text>
  <text start="105.09" dur="4.62">indicators and we look at these</text>
  <text start="107.16" dur="5.28">indicators throughout time we see their</text>
  <text start="109.71" dur="5.82">stagnant some of them are declining</text>
  <text start="112.44" dur="5.91">rapidly for instance when we look at new</text>
  <text start="115.53" dur="5.61">home sales or existing home sales we can</text>
  <text start="118.35" dur="4.62">see that this is really gone nowhere and</text>
  <text start="121.14" dur="4.319">what they do is they play around with</text>
  <text start="122.97" dur="4.5">the numbers to make us think that the</text>
  <text start="125.459" dur="3.571">housing market is about to take off if</text>
  <text start="127.47" dur="4.28">you notice those are the words they</text>
  <text start="129.03" dur="5.64">always use the real estate market well</text>
  <text start="131.75" dur="5.14">it&amp;#39;s getting ready to take off it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="134.67" dur="5.73">getting ready to really take off and and</text>
  <text start="136.89" dur="5.97">make this economy strong but what they</text>
  <text start="140.4" dur="5.73">really do is they go back to prior</text>
  <text start="142.86" dur="6.69">months like june july august and they</text>
  <text start="146.13" dur="5.88">revised the numbers down which will make</text>
  <text start="149.55" dur="6.69">September look better because if they</text>
  <text start="152.01" dur="6.3">don&amp;#39;t do these type of things it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="156.24" dur="4.77">look good they can&amp;#39;t say oh look in</text>
  <text start="158.31" dur="5.1">September new home sales just surged and</text>
  <text start="161.01" dur="4.92">this is exactly what they did they went</text>
  <text start="163.41" dur="5.43">back in time they revised the numbers</text>
  <text start="165.93" dur="5.19">down even further to make September look</text>
  <text start="168.84" dur="6.509">good and then they were expecting about</text>
  <text start="171.12" dur="6.929">600,000 sales of new homes September</text>
  <text start="175.349" dur="4.151">came in around 593 thousand and of</text>
  <text start="178.049" dur="4.631">course it</text>
  <text start="179.5" dur="5.09">Rose a lot more than they thought it was</text>
  <text start="182.68" dur="5.85">going to but it was below the</text>
  <text start="184.59" dur="8.65">expectations and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="188.53" dur="7.53">they continually do this to use this</text>
  <text start="193.24" dur="6.27">type of propaganda amongst the public to</text>
  <text start="196.06" dur="5.28">convince them that we&amp;#39;re doing well</text>
  <text start="199.51" dur="3.42">because people don&amp;#39;t remember the prior</text>
  <text start="201.34" dur="3.96">months they all remember what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="202.93" dur="5.46">hearing right now ooh new homes sales</text>
  <text start="205.3" dur="5.52">surged existing home sales surged they</text>
  <text start="208.39" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t remember what happened in the</text>
  <text start="210.82" dur="3.51">prior months but we&amp;#39;re keeping track of</text>
  <text start="212.53" dur="4.44">everything and when we look at pending</text>
  <text start="214.33" dur="5.04">home sales and we look at existing I</text>
  <text start="216.97" dur="5.25">mean new home sales we see right now</text>
  <text start="219.37" dur="6.83">that they&amp;#39;re really going absolutely</text>
  <text start="222.22" dur="9.09">nowhere and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="226.2" dur="7.3">the real estate market is heading</text>
  <text start="231.31" dur="5.04">towards this gigantic bubble because we</text>
  <text start="233.5" dur="5.989">just hit the mark where the prices are</text>
  <text start="236.35" dur="6.54">even to 2006 at the height of the bubble</text>
  <text start="239.489" dur="6.371">here we are today and this is without</text>
  <text start="242.89" dur="5.849">the American public being involved this</text>
  <text start="245.86" dur="5.34">is with foreign investors hedge funds</text>
  <text start="248.739" dur="6.091">investment companies coming in and</text>
  <text start="251.2" dur="7.2">purchasing homes buying them holding</text>
  <text start="254.83" dur="6.93">them renting them if they can but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="258.4" dur="5.19">all starting to deteriorate we see</text>
  <text start="261.76" dur="3.45">cushman and wakefield they released</text>
  <text start="263.59" dur="5.13">their third quarter 2016 New York City</text>
  <text start="265.21" dur="5.19">retail rental update and it&amp;#39;s bad news</text>
  <text start="268.72" dur="4.92">for commercial real estate owners in</text>
  <text start="270.4" dur="5.79">Manhattan retail rental rates declined</text>
  <text start="273.64" dur="5.66">year-on-year and nine out of the 11</text>
  <text start="276.19" dur="7.68">Manhattan submarkets tracked by Cushman</text>
  <text start="279.3" dur="7.2">while vacancies well they have soared to</text>
  <text start="283.87" dur="7.2">over twenty percent in several markets</text>
  <text start="286.5" dur="7.9">and we see lower fifth avenue right now</text>
  <text start="291.07" dur="6.99">is registering the highest vacancy rate</text>
  <text start="294.4" dur="8.85">in the city at twenty nine point three</text>
  <text start="298.06" dur="7.71">percent doesn&amp;#39;t look good today we heard</text>
  <text start="303.25" dur="6.06">in the corporate media that services PMI</text>
  <text start="305.77" dur="6.239">surged to 54.8 it&amp;#39;s the highest since</text>
  <text start="309.31" dur="6.18">november of 2015</text>
  <text start="312.009" dur="5.88">well when we look through this and we</text>
  <text start="315.49" dur="4.349">look at the data the reason why it</text>
  <text start="317.889" dur="6.18">surged was because of government</text>
  <text start="319.839" dur="8.85">spending in the last quarter and it</text>
  <text start="324.069" dur="6.33">spiked these surveys up wasn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="328.689" dur="3.51">people once again it was a government</text>
  <text start="330.399" dur="5.04">that was continually borrowing money and</text>
  <text start="332.199" dur="6.18">just went out and spent we see wholesale</text>
  <text start="335.439" dur="4.741">inventories well they were unchanged</text>
  <text start="338.379" dur="6.27">year-over-year for the first time since</text>
  <text start="340.18" dur="9.81">June of 2010 and we&amp;#39;re seeing this is</text>
  <text start="344.649" dur="8.19">the weakest that we&amp;#39;ve seen and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="349.99" dur="6.899">happening right now is we are heading</text>
  <text start="352.839" dur="8.371">down to that area where we were back in</text>
  <text start="356.889" dur="6.24">two thousand eight and when we look at</text>
  <text start="361.21" dur="6.12">the graph we are in a downward</text>
  <text start="363.129" dur="7.641">trajectory and it doesn&amp;#39;t look like</text>
  <text start="367.33" dur="7.079">there&amp;#39;s any improvement whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="370.77" dur="4.989">below the surface things are not looking</text>
  <text start="374.409" dur="3.331">good i mean we&amp;#39;re looking at motor</text>
  <text start="375.759" dur="4.321">vehicle inventories they&amp;#39;re up again</text>
  <text start="377.74" dur="7.199">month on month and they&amp;#39;re up by nine</text>
  <text start="380.08" dur="6.149">percent year-on-year which tells us that</text>
  <text start="384.939" dur="4.35">people aren&amp;#39;t buying they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="386.229" dur="6.15">channel stuffing once again remember how</text>
  <text start="389.289" dur="5.28">this whole thing works manufacturing in</text>
  <text start="392.379" dur="5.31">the auto industry they produce the cars</text>
  <text start="394.569" dur="6.39">and when the dealer accepts them that</text>
  <text start="397.689" dur="6.391">counted as a sale whatever the dealer</text>
  <text start="400.959" dur="6.39">does at that point doesn&amp;#39;t really matter</text>
  <text start="404.08" dur="5.579">so they continually channel stuff these</text>
  <text start="407.349" dur="6.75">dealers as with much inventory as they</text>
  <text start="409.659" dur="9.65">possibly can now we&amp;#39;re getting another</text>
  <text start="414.099" dur="10.44">confirmation that we are in a recession</text>
  <text start="419.309" dur="9.03">we are in a very weak economy and this</text>
  <text start="424.539" dur="7.831">is the weakest economic trend since 2008</text>
  <text start="428.339" dur="6.73">for the first time since 2012 the</text>
  <text start="432.37" dur="5.75">richmond fed business survey has been in</text>
  <text start="435.069" dur="6.06">contraction below zero for three</text>
  <text start="438.12" dur="7.84">straight months and four of the last</text>
  <text start="441.129" dur="6.811">five were still the six-month average</text>
  <text start="445.96" dur="5.01">the Business Survey has not deteriorated</text>
  <text start="447.94" dur="9.21">this fast since the second quarter of</text>
  <text start="450.97" dur="11.849">two thousand eight we are in a recession</text>
  <text start="457.15" dur="9.54">at this point we are headed towards a</text>
  <text start="462.819" dur="7.41">collapse and when we look at all these</text>
  <text start="466.69" dur="7.289">economic indicators they are either the</text>
  <text start="470.229" dur="6.951">same as 2008 or they are worse at this</text>
  <text start="473.979" dur="7.291">point and remember the central bank</text>
  <text start="477.18" dur="7.06">since 2008 what they have done was not</text>
  <text start="481.27" dur="6.39">improve the economy they have not put</text>
  <text start="484.24" dur="7.26">people back to work they haven&amp;#39;t put</text>
  <text start="487.66" dur="8.129">currency into the market what they have</text>
  <text start="491.5" dur="9.919">done was they figured out a way at how</text>
  <text start="495.789" dur="9.241">to keep the economy stable that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="501.419" dur="7.78">they don&amp;#39;t have the ability to grow the</text>
  <text start="505.03" dur="8.939">economy all they did was keep the</text>
  <text start="509.199" dur="8.931">economy on life support there is no</text>
  <text start="513.969" dur="7.801">brain function it cannot do anything</text>
  <text start="518.13" dur="7.57">that&amp;#39;s all they have done and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="521.77" dur="7.77">headed to this point right now where the</text>
  <text start="525.7" dur="6.99">economy is deteriorating very very</text>
  <text start="529.54" dur="7.23">quickly in this life support will not be</text>
  <text start="532.69" dur="7.82">able to keep the economy running the</text>
  <text start="536.77" dur="6.96">debt around the world is unsustainable</text>
  <text start="540.51" dur="6.13">we&amp;#39;re seeing indicators like retail</text>
  <text start="543.73" dur="6.9">contracting people losing their jobs</text>
  <text start="546.64" dur="7.05">from more corporations GDP I mean we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="550.63" dur="5.61">looking at one percent here which is</text>
  <text start="553.69" dur="5.3">absolutely awful and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="556.24" dur="5.969">manipulated number we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="558.99" dur="5.2">delinquencies they&amp;#39;re on the rise the</text>
  <text start="562.209" dur="4.741">richmond fed just signaled that this is</text>
  <text start="564.19" dur="4.8">the weakest economy the housing market</text>
  <text start="566.95" dur="3.389">has just reached the top of the bubble</text>
  <text start="568.99" dur="3.27">and you know what happens when we reach</text>
  <text start="570.339" dur="5.37">the top the whole thing comes crashing</text>
  <text start="572.26" dur="6.94">down and when we look at corporate</text>
  <text start="575.709" dur="6.761">defaults they are on the rise</text>
  <text start="579.2" dur="9.24">everything is pointing to a collapse of</text>
  <text start="582.47" dur="9.03">the system and we know there&amp;#39;s problems</text>
  <text start="588.44" dur="5.97">throughout Europe with deutsche bank</text>
  <text start="591.5" dur="6.18">with the italian bank monte dei paschi</text>
  <text start="594.41" dur="7.92">and we see right now the bank of england</text>
  <text start="597.68" dur="8.58">right now is asking the UK banks to look</text>
  <text start="602.33" dur="7.26">at their exposure to deutsche and the</text>
  <text start="606.26" dur="8.79">italian banks so if something should</text>
  <text start="609.59" dur="9.93">happen how much exposure is there well</text>
  <text start="615.05" dur="8.97">we know right now that if they do not</text>
  <text start="619.52" dur="6.63">bail out or bail in deutsche bank we</text>
  <text start="624.02" dur="4.98">know this will create a chain reaction</text>
  <text start="626.15" dur="5.19">throughout Europe and it will eventually</text>
  <text start="629" dur="6.24">hit the United States I mean oh hit</text>
  <text start="631.34" dur="8.22">Canada hood Australia the UK but we can</text>
  <text start="635.24" dur="7.86">see that this will be a major problem</text>
  <text start="639.56" dur="6.09">and we can see right now they realize</text>
  <text start="643.1" dur="6.45">what&amp;#39;s going on this reminds me of the</text>
  <text start="645.65" dur="6.54">time we were in the summer of two</text>
  <text start="649.55" dur="4.26">thousand eight at that time period when</text>
  <text start="652.19" dur="4.35">Bear Stearns when there was major</text>
  <text start="653.81" dur="5.34">problems with Bear Stearns and other</text>
  <text start="656.54" dur="4.59">banks and other financial institutions</text>
  <text start="659.15" dur="4.02">other insurance companies were also</text>
  <text start="661.13" dur="5.7">having the same problems but they were</text>
  <text start="663.17" dur="4.98">keeping that very very quiet and they</text>
  <text start="666.83" dur="6.75">were trying to figure out ways of</text>
  <text start="668.15" dur="6.75">keeping it completely contained and what</text>
  <text start="673.58" dur="3.66">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now they&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="674.9" dur="5.04">same thing we have Deutsche Bank we have</text>
  <text start="677.24" dur="5.13">the Italian banks we have many of the US</text>
  <text start="679.94" dur="4.2">banks where they&amp;#39;re looking at them and</text>
  <text start="682.37" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;re trying to keep everything</text>
  <text start="684.14" dur="6.21">contained and they do this because they</text>
  <text start="688.4" dur="4.11">don&amp;#39;t want something to happen where</text>
  <text start="690.35" dur="5.57">they don&amp;#39;t have control over the entire</text>
  <text start="692.51" dur="6.66">economy collapsing because they want a</text>
  <text start="695.92" dur="5.74">controlled demolition and this reminds</text>
  <text start="699.17" dur="5.25">me of that year we have the elections</text>
  <text start="701.66" dur="5.46">going on right now deutsche bank is in</text>
  <text start="704.42" dur="4.59">trouble Bear Stearns was in trouble we</text>
  <text start="707.12" dur="5.73">have a candidate that is saying that the</text>
  <text start="709.01" dur="6.6">economy is in a recession</text>
  <text start="712.85" dur="4.049">back then I hate to say it but Obama</text>
  <text start="715.61" dur="4.289">said there were problems with the</text>
  <text start="716.899" dur="6.391">economy at that point McCain said the</text>
  <text start="719.899" dur="5.67">economy was fine Hillary&amp;#39;s really not</text>
  <text start="723.29" dur="5.7">acknowledging that the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="725.569" dur="5.88">poorly and it starting to look like</text>
  <text start="728.99" dur="5.01">we&amp;#39;re at the same exact spot we had the</text>
  <text start="731.449" dur="6.51">housing market at the same level with</text>
  <text start="734" dur="6.959">this bubble the stock market is at</text>
  <text start="737.959" dur="7.471">all-time highs I mean look at the</text>
  <text start="740.959" dur="7.591">similarities right now and we have the</text>
  <text start="745.43" dur="6.269">subprime securities in the auto industry</text>
  <text start="748.55" dur="8.45">the subprime securities in the real</text>
  <text start="751.699" dur="9.211">estate market with the shadow banking I</text>
  <text start="757" dur="9.22">mean they are completely duplicating</text>
  <text start="760.91" dur="8.9">what happened in 2008 but this time it</text>
  <text start="766.22" dur="6.359">is completely different this time</text>
  <text start="769.81" dur="4.329">there&amp;#39;s going to be more businesses that</text>
  <text start="772.579" dur="3.211">are going to be shutting down there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="774.139" dur="5.25">going to be more people that are going</text>
  <text start="775.79" dur="6.21">to be out of work they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="779.389" dur="6.271">be able to save the economy this time</text>
  <text start="782" dur="7.68">they know it because there&amp;#39;s no bailouts</text>
  <text start="785.66" dur="7.529">and they printed or created currency out</text>
