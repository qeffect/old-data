  <text start="104.08" dur="7.649">news now we are seeing more and more</text>
  <text start="108.34" dur="8.36">proof that Obamacare is a complete</text>
  <text start="111.729" dur="7.741">disaster and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="116.7" dur="5.41">Obamacare was never a benefit to the</text>
  <text start="119.47" dur="4.709">people and what we&amp;#39;re looking at right</text>
  <text start="122.11" dur="4.739">now and this is a report coming from the</text>
  <text start="124.179" dur="5.461">children&amp;#39;s health fund shows that more</text>
  <text start="126.849" dur="4.261">than one-fourth of American children do</text>
  <text start="129.64" dur="3.42">not get the health care they need</text>
  <text start="131.11" dur="5.78">according to the report 3 point 33</text>
  <text start="133.06" dur="6.63">million American children are uninsured</text>
  <text start="136.89" dur="5.41">making matters worse there are 20</text>
  <text start="139.69" dur="5.1">million children in America who do have</text>
  <text start="142.3" dur="4.98">insurance but still do not have access</text>
  <text start="144.79" dur="4.98">to the necessary health care more than</text>
  <text start="147.28" dur="5.459">10 million children are insured but do</text>
  <text start="149.77" dur="4.92">not have access to primary care and they</text>
  <text start="152.739" dur="4.051">miss checkup they miss their checkups as</text>
  <text start="154.69" dur="5.37">a result and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="156.79" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s very clear that the system failed</text>
  <text start="160.06" dur="4.679">to deliver on its promise Obamacare</text>
  <text start="161.98" dur="6.119">didn&amp;#39;t do what it said it was going to</text>
  <text start="164.739" dur="7.021">do and we can see what the premiums they</text>
  <text start="168.099" dur="7.831">are increasing and what&amp;#39;s happening is</text>
  <text start="171.76" dur="8.039">people can&amp;#39;t afford Obamacare now</text>
  <text start="175.93" dur="6.06">remember the children the young they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="179.799" dur="5.491">supposed to be the healthy</text>
  <text start="181.99" dur="6.57">portion of the population and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="185.29" dur="6.03">supposed to be paying a small fraction</text>
  <text start="188.56" dur="6">of health insurance but what has</text>
  <text start="191.32" dur="6.18">happened is the way they designed</text>
  <text start="194.56" dur="5.34">Obamacare where they had the penalty</text>
  <text start="197.5" dur="4.71">where it pushed everyone into it and</text>
  <text start="199.9" dur="4.83">people decided not to go into it they</text>
  <text start="202.21" dur="5.67">didn&amp;#39;t have the base they needed to keep</text>
  <text start="204.73" dur="5.31">the premiums down because people weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="207.88" dur="5.01">getting a benefit from it see when you</text>
  <text start="210.04" dur="5.4">have a product and it doesn&amp;#39;t work for</text>
  <text start="212.89" dur="4.95">the people this is how the people react</text>
  <text start="215.44" dur="4.83">they say you know something we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="217.84" dur="9.27">going to buy this because it&amp;#39;s no good</text>
  <text start="220.27" dur="9.3">and we see right now that the Affordable</text>
  <text start="227.11" dur="5.87">Care Act the premiums have skyrocketed</text>
  <text start="229.57" dur="7.05">to sixty-seven percent in some cases and</text>
  <text start="232.98" dur="6.88">we know that 23 of the Obamacare coops</text>
  <text start="236.62" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;ve collapsed and the 8 million</text>
  <text start="239.86" dur="4.32">Americans were hit with more than 3</text>
  <text start="241.54" dur="7.29">billion in penalties from the IRS for</text>
  <text start="244.18" dur="8.12">not buying health insurance how possibly</text>
  <text start="248.83" dur="6.99">do you want the American people to react</text>
  <text start="252.3" dur="8.74">look what the government has done to the</text>
  <text start="255.82" dur="12.78">people premium skyrocketing and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="261.04" dur="10.86">penalized it doesn&amp;#39;t work now we can see</text>
  <text start="268.6" dur="7.82">that the corporate media the US</text>
  <text start="271.9" dur="10.86">government the Clinton campaign they are</text>
  <text start="276.42" dur="10.98">pushing the idea that Russia is involved</text>
  <text start="282.76" dur="8.19">in the email leaks Russia is involved in</text>
  <text start="287.4" dur="8.98">hacking the elections and the elite</text>
  <text start="290.95" dur="9.48">right now they want Trump out of the way</text>
  <text start="296.38" dur="9.11">and they&amp;#39;re using Russia to get their</text>
  <text start="300.43" dur="8.88">way and yesterday we reported on the</text>
  <text start="305.49" dur="5.679">British ambassador to Uzbekistan the</text>
  <text start="309.31" dur="6.21">Chancellor of university of dundee Greg</text>
  <text start="311.169" dur="6.511">Murray and he wrote that Julian Assange</text>
  <text start="315.52" dur="5.19">made it crystal clear that the leaks did</text>
  <text start="317.68" dur="7.62">not come from Russia it came from an</text>
  <text start="320.71" dur="6.929">insider and Craig Murray met one of them</text>
  <text start="325.3" dur="4.799">and we can see right now Murray did</text>
  <text start="327.639" dur="5.761">confirm that rush did not hack the</text>
  <text start="330.099" dur="4.591">Democratic Party emails he said an</text>
  <text start="333.4" dur="5.46">American intelligence whistleblower</text>
  <text start="334.69" dur="6.42">leaked them and david swanson</text>
  <text start="338.86" dur="5.73">interviewed murray and obtain additional</text>
  <text start="341.11" dur="5.94">information specifically Murray said</text>
  <text start="344.59" dur="4.44">there are two American leakers one free</text>
  <text start="347.05" dur="4.29">the emails of the Democratic National</text>
  <text start="349.03" dur="5.91">Committee and one for the emails of a</text>
  <text start="351.34" dur="6.27">top Clinton aide John Podesta Mary</text>
  <text start="354.94" dur="5.67">Murray met with one of the leakers both</text>
  <text start="357.61" dur="7.489">leaguers are American insiders working</text>
  <text start="360.61" dur="8.309">with the NSA and maybe with the DNC and</text>
  <text start="365.099" dur="6.88">there is no connection to Russia</text>
  <text start="368.919" dur="4.68">whatsoever and we can see why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="371.979" dur="4.231">keeping their identities hidden because</text>
  <text start="373.599" dur="5.011">the Obama administration they have</text>
  <text start="376.21" dur="5.639">prosecuted more whistleblowers than all</text>
  <text start="378.61" dur="4.92">other presidents combined and we can see</text>
  <text start="381.849" dur="4.261">why they go after whistleblowers because</text>
  <text start="383.53" dur="7.62">they don&amp;#39;t want the truth out there so</text>
  <text start="386.11" dur="9.72">the elite the Clinton campaign Obama you</text>
  <text start="391.15" dur="8.669">name it they are trying to stop Trump so</text>
  <text start="395.83" dur="6.8">what are they&amp;#39;ve done so far well we can</text>
  <text start="399.819" dur="8.25">see right now they were able to get 10</text>
  <text start="402.63" dur="9.159">presidential electors to question this</text>
  <text start="408.069" dur="6.72">entire propaganda scandal about Russia</text>
  <text start="411.789" dur="5.43">hacking the election system this is what</text>
  <text start="414.789" dur="5.16">they want they want them to question</text>
  <text start="417.219" dur="7.38">this because in the end they want them</text>
  <text start="419.949" dur="5.911">to invalidate the elections the Clinton</text>
  <text start="424.599" dur="3.991">campaign right now is publicly</text>
  <text start="425.86" dur="4.02">supporting the effort to arrange the</text>
  <text start="428.59" dur="4.109">members of the electoral college should</text>
  <text start="429.88" dur="4.439">be given intelligence briefing on the</text>
  <text start="432.699" dur="4.77">Russian interference which they have no</text>
  <text start="434.319" dur="4.861">evidence whatsoever the Senate Majority</text>

  <text start="449.23" dur="4.2">they are very much desire to see an</text>
  <text start="451.78" dur="4.97">investigation into Russian interference</text>
  <text start="453.43" dur="6.6">in the election US Representative Dave</text>
  <text start="456.75" dur="4.96">Sicilian is urging electors to consider</text>
  <text start="460.03" dur="4.02">the extent that foreign interference</text>
  <text start="461.71" dur="5.7">united states presidential elections may</text>
  <text start="464.05" dur="6.84">have influenced the final results before</text>
  <text start="467.41" dur="9.38">they cast their votes which is funny</text>
  <text start="470.89" dur="9.75">because hillary won the popular vote</text>
  <text start="476.79" dur="6.82">keep that in mind US representative jim</text>
  <text start="480.64" dur="5.16">Himes is calling Donald Trump a danger</text>
  <text start="483.61" dur="3.75">to the Republic and is publicly</text>
  <text start="485.8" dur="3.87">encouraging members of the electoral</text>
  <text start="487.36" dur="4.71">college to vote for someone other than</text>
  <text start="489.67" dur="5.82">Donald Trump on December nineteenth Time</text>
  <text start="492.07" dur="4.71">magazine is openly lobbying for members</text>
  <text start="495.49" dur="3.78">of the Electoral College to vote for</text>
  <text start="496.78" dur="4.11">someone else than Donald Trump the</text>
  <text start="499.27" dur="7.14">former direct the former acting director</text>
  <text start="500.89" dur="7.44">of the CIA has proclaimed that Russian</text>
  <text start="506.41" dur="3.9">attempts to alter the outcome of the</text>
  <text start="508.33" dur="6.98">election in November where the political</text>
  <text start="510.31" dur="9.48">equivalent of 9-11 former CIA agent Rob</text>
  <text start="515.31" dur="8.95">bear recently went on CNN and said we</text>
  <text start="519.79" dur="6.36">need new elections Obama has ordered the</text>
  <text start="524.26" dur="4.2">intelligence community to gather all the</text>
  <text start="526.15" dur="4.38">evidence that it can find on Russian</text>
  <text start="528.46" dur="4.44">interference in the election and to</text>
  <text start="530.53" dur="5.94">deliver the evidence before he leaves</text>
  <text start="532.9" dur="5.4">office so right now we can see the</text>
  <text start="536.47" dur="6.84">corporate media they are completely</text>
  <text start="538.3" dur="8.94">behind this we can see that this is a</text>
  <text start="543.31" dur="8.19">group effort to stop what&amp;#39;s going on now</text>
  <text start="547.24" dur="7.11">this is a soft coup this doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="551.5" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s going to work we can see the elite</text>
  <text start="554.35" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re pushing as hard as they possibly</text>
  <text start="556.36" dur="7.67">can and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="559.99" dur="6.96">that more electors are demanding the</text>
  <text start="564.03" dur="5.41">briefing the intelligence briefing 29</text>
  <text start="566.95" dur="4.38">electors are now pressuring Director of</text>
  <text start="569.44" dur="3.81">National Intelligence James clapper that</text>
  <text start="571.33" dur="6.03">disclosed more information about the</text>
  <text start="573.25" dur="6.69">CIA&amp;#39;s conclusion now the electors are</text>
  <text start="577.36" dur="5.79">required to know from the intelligence</text>
  <text start="579.94" dur="5.54">community whether there are ongoing</text>
  <text start="583.15" dur="6.96">asian into ties between Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="585.48" dur="8.41">with the Russian government so they are</text>
  <text start="590.11" dur="8.04">trying to basically have him</text>
  <text start="593.89" dur="8.19">disqualified and they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="598.15" dur="7.2">this before December nineteenth now if</text>
  <text start="602.08" dur="4.77">37 Republican electors can be persuaded</text>
  <text start="605.35" dur="3.99">to cast their votes for someone other</text>
  <text start="606.85" dur="4.92">than Trump that would throw the election</text>
  <text start="609.34" dur="4.86">into the house of representatives and it</text>
  <text start="611.77" dur="6.36">is unclear what the house would do in</text>
  <text start="614.2" dur="6.06">that scenario now during the joint</text>
  <text start="618.13" dur="4.8">session members of Congress may object</text>
  <text start="620.26" dur="5.16">to individual electoral votes or to</text>
  <text start="622.93" dur="4.14">state returns as a whole an objection</text>
  <text start="625.42" dur="3.9">must be declared in writing and signed</text>
  <text start="627.07" dur="5.19">by at least one representative and one</text>
  <text start="629.32" dur="5.61">senator in the case of an objection the</text>
  <text start="632.26" dur="4.77">joint session recesses and each chamber</text>
  <text start="634.93" dur="3.72">considers the objection separately in a</text>
  <text start="637.03" dur="4.92">session which cannot last more than two</text>
  <text start="638.65" dur="4.83">hours with each member speaking for no</text>
  <text start="641.95" dur="4.59">more than five minutes five minutes</text>
  <text start="643.48" dur="5.46">after each House votes on whether or not</text>
  <text start="646.54" dur="4.08">to accept the objection the joint</text>
  <text start="648.94" dur="3.99">session reconvenes and both chambers</text>
  <text start="650.62" dur="5.4">disclose their decisions if they agree</text>
  <text start="652.93" dur="5.49">to the objection the votes and questions</text>
  <text start="656.02" dur="4.29">are not counted if either chamber does</text>
  <text start="658.42" dur="7.14">not agree with the objection the votes</text>
  <text start="660.31" dur="8.78">are counted and they want this to go</text>
  <text start="665.56" dur="9.72">into the house they want Trump</text>
  <text start="669.09" dur="9.82">disqualified they want Hillary in now</text>
  <text start="675.28" dur="6.18">during this process there might be a</text>
  <text start="678.91" dur="5.97">time period where Obama might have to</text>
  <text start="681.46" dur="5.79">extend his presidency now we discuss</text>
  <text start="684.88" dur="4.11">this in many many reports where Obama</text>
  <text start="687.25" dur="5.4">might not be leap he might not be</text>
  <text start="688.99" dur="6.27">leaving the White House and we can see</text>
  <text start="692.65" dur="4.56">right now this could be a possibility</text>
  <text start="695.26" dur="4.74">now it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that this is all</text>
  <text start="697.21" dur="4.8">going to work out for the elite this is</text>
  <text start="700" dur="5.48">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do now the</text>
  <text start="702.01" dur="6.8">Director of National Intelligence well</text>
  <text start="705.48" dur="7.18">they&amp;#39;re looking at the information and</text>
  <text start="708.81" dur="7.73">they say well the CIA has no proof now</text>
  <text start="712.66" dur="6.91">oh D&amp;amp;I they</text>
  <text start="716.54" dur="6.12">are the overseers of the intelligence</text>
  <text start="719.57" dur="5.07">community and they&amp;#39;re not arguing that</text>
  <text start="722.66" dur="4.74">the agency the CIA agency is wrong</text>
  <text start="724.64" dur="8.76">they&amp;#39;re saying that they can&amp;#39;t prove</text>
  <text start="727.4" dur="8.37">intent they don&amp;#39;t have evidence and we</text>
  <text start="733.4" dur="4.41">can see that Trump could use this as</text>
  <text start="735.77" dur="3.78">ammunition saying there&amp;#39;s no evidence</text>
  <text start="737.81" dur="4.98">whatsoever but they don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="739.55" dur="6.78">that they just want the electors to</text>
  <text start="742.79" dur="6.66">question it to postpone to say maybe</text>
  <text start="746.33" dur="4.41">he&amp;#39;s not fit to be President and we can</text>
  <text start="749.45" dur="6.09">see they&amp;#39;re trying to do this with no</text>
  <text start="750.74" dur="6.9">evidence whatsoever and we need to watch</text>
  <text start="755.54" dur="4.5">this very carefully we&amp;#39;re coming up to</text>
  <text start="757.64" dur="5.76">December nineteenth that&amp;#39;s six days away</text>
  <text start="760.04" dur="6.66">right now and if the elite pull this off</text>
  <text start="763.4" dur="6.17">this is a game changer that means</text>
  <text start="766.7" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re on track once again for war</text>
  <text start="769.57" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re on track to bring down the</text>
  <text start="772.34" dur="4.8">economy it was coming down anyhow and</text>
  <text start="774.1" dur="8.04">they&amp;#39;re on track to do everything they</text>
  <text start="777.14" dur="8.52">set out to do so we can see right now</text>
  <text start="782.14" dur="5.35">they&amp;#39;re going to be moving into another</text>

  <text start="787.49" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;ll go into Phase three and each</text>
  <text start="789.83" dur="4.83">time each phase they&amp;#39;re going to become</text>
  <text start="792.8" dur="5.22">more and more desperate which means</text>
  <text start="794.66" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re going to do things where people</text>
  <text start="798.02" dur="4.83">are going to look at it and say whoa</text>
  <text start="800.45" dur="6.51">what just happened and most likely if</text>
  <text start="802.85" dur="7.41">they can&amp;#39;t stop Trump they will</text>
  <text start="806.96" dur="8.37">assassinate him now many reports ago we</text>
  <text start="810.26" dur="8.37">talked about how the elite central</text>
  <text start="815.33" dur="7.85">bankers the deep state they want to</text>
  <text start="818.63" dur="8.16">track each person and they talked about</text>
  <text start="823.18" dur="7.21">microchipping people it was even on NBC</text>
  <text start="826.79" dur="6.78">Nightly News who predicted that RFID</text>
  <text start="830.39" dur="6.63">microchips will be fitted to most</text>
  <text start="833.57" dur="5.76">Americans in 2017 well we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="837.02" dur="7.02">into 2017 and they said this about six</text>
  <text start="839.33" dur="10.49">years ago so very interestingly the</text>
  <text start="844.04" dur="9.01">house last Thursday passed HR 491</text>
  <text start="849.82" dur="5.58">also known as the Kevin avantis law</text>
  <text start="853.05" dur="4.57">which would allow the US Attorney</text>
  <text start="855.4" dur="3.53">General to award grants to law</text>
  <text start="857.62" dur="5.4">enforcement for the creation and</text>
  <text start="858.93" dur="7.03">operation of located tracking technology</text>
  <text start="863.02" dur="4.8">programs the program&amp;#39;s mission right now</text>
  <text start="865.96" dur="3.81">is to find individuals with forms of</text>
  <text start="867.82" dur="4.89">dementia or children with developmental</text>
  <text start="869.77" dur="6.57">disabilities who have wandered from safe</text>
  <text start="872.71" dur="5.52">environments it provides no restrictions</text>
  <text start="876.34" dur="4.5">on the tracking programs inclusion of</text>
  <text start="878.23" dur="5.34">other individuals the bill would also</text>
  <text start="880.84" dur="5.42">require the eternal general to work with</text>
  <text start="883.57" dur="5.01">the Secretary of Health Human Services</text>
  <text start="886.26" dur="4.87">unnamed health organizations to</text>
  <text start="888.58" dur="5.88">establish the best practices for the use</text>
  <text start="891.13" dur="6.56">of these devices and this is how it</text>
  <text start="894.46" dur="5.88">begins just like in the beginning of</text>
  <text start="897.69" dur="7.69">censoring free speech or anything else</text>
  <text start="900.34" dur="7.86">the government does or the elite do they</text>
  <text start="905.38" dur="4.56">start off very small saying yes look for</text>
  <text start="908.2" dur="4.8">those individuals that are mentally</text>
  <text start="909.94" dur="4.95">handicapped let&amp;#39;s put a tracking device</text>
  <text start="913" dur="5.37">in them so we can find them if they ever</text>
  <text start="914.89" dur="9.12">run away who would object to this nobody</text>
  <text start="918.37" dur="8.37">and what happens is they say wow this is</text>
  <text start="924.01" dur="6.32">great let&amp;#39;s expand this program now</text>
  <text start="926.74" dur="8.49">remember they started off with animals</text>
  <text start="930.33" dur="7.69">put a chip in your animal you can find</text>
  <text start="935.23" dur="6.48">the animals location just in case your</text>
  <text start="938.02" dur="7.14">animal runs away like a cat or dog now</text>
  <text start="941.71" dur="6.3">they&amp;#39;re moving it into people now of</text>
  <text start="945.16" dur="7.08">course what the reason they do this is</text>
  <text start="948.01" dur="6.54">to get everyone used to the idea it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="952.24" dur="4.86">okay to put the chip in you it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="954.55" dur="3.93">going for animals so that&amp;#39;s okay now</text>
  <text start="957.1" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s going for those individuals that</text>
  <text start="958.48" dur="5.22">might have dementia mentally handicapped</text>
  <text start="961.03" dur="6.75">let&amp;#39;s put a chip in them and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="963.7" dur="8.82">slowly brainwashing everyone to accept</text>
  <text start="967.78" dur="6.87">this type of technology and we can see</text>
  <text start="972.52" dur="5.55">most likely by the hand of 2017 going</text>
  <text start="974.65" dur="8.07">into 2018 they&amp;#39;ll pick another category</text>
  <text start="978.07" dur="6.569">of people to say this is why we think</text>
  <text start="982.72" dur="3.869">they should have the microchipping and</text>
  <text start="984.639" dur="5.19">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="986.589" dur="5.761">that everyone should have it so the</text>
  <text start="989.829" dur="7.291">elite they are still pushing forward on</text>
  <text start="992.35" dur="6.83">their agenda they haven&amp;#39;t stopped we can</text>
  <text start="997.12" dur="4.589">see right now the US State Department</text>
  <text start="999.18" dur="5.29">they have given its approval for a</text>
  <text start="1001.709" dur="5.25">possible 1.7 billion military sale to</text>
  <text start="1004.47" dur="7.25">Kuwait they&amp;#39;re going to sell them about</text>
  <text start="1006.959" dur="7.651">218 m1a2 tanks and related equipment and</text>
  <text start="1011.72" dur="7.15">we can see right now that they are</text>
  <text start="1014.61" dur="9.51">arming the Middle East because there is</text>
  <text start="1018.87" dur="8.719">a war coming a rack their army units</text>
  <text start="1024.12" dur="6.66">they&amp;#39;re continually pushing forward and</text>
  <text start="1027.589" dur="6.641">they&amp;#39;re expecting to have muscle cleared</text>
  <text start="1030.78" dur="6.779">of all terrorism by the end of 2016 the</text>
  <text start="1034.23" dur="6.209">next couple of weeks we see right now</text>
  <text start="1037.559" dur="4.591">that Russia and Syria they have</text>
  <text start="1040.439" dur="6.661">evacuated many of the civilians in the</text>
  <text start="1042.15" dur="8.94">Palmyra area and they are now lighting</text>
  <text start="1047.1" dur="7.74">up that entire area they&amp;#39;re going after</text>
  <text start="1051.09" dur="7.38">the Islamic state and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1054.84" dur="8.42">destroy them we already see that Aleppo</text>
  <text start="1058.47" dur="9.06">has been liberated Syrian Army has now</text>
  <text start="1063.26" dur="6.85">basically taken control of Aleppo the</text>
  <text start="1067.53" dur="4.95">people in Aleppo they are celebrating</text>
  <text start="1070.11" dur="6.24">their having celebrations that the</text>
  <text start="1072.48" dur="5.939">terrorists are gone and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1076.35" dur="5.49">the military operation is over in this</text>
  <text start="1078.419" dur="5.551">area Russia has left the Syrian forces</text>
  <text start="1081.84" dur="3.62">have taken control and of course here in</text>
  <text start="1083.97" dur="6.15">the United States on the corporate media</text>
  <text start="1085.46" dur="7.599">they&amp;#39;re saying that the Syrian Armed</text>
  <text start="1090.12" dur="6.51">Forces they&amp;#39;re just willy-nilly shooting</text>
  <text start="1093.059" dur="6.331">people in the streets well the part they</text>
  <text start="1096.63" dur="4.77">left out was it is actually the</text>
  <text start="1099.39" dur="4.35">terrorists the snipers that are shooting</text>
  <text start="1101.4" dur="4.35">down the people in the streets actually</text>
  <text start="1103.74" dur="5.1">what Russia and Syria are doing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1105.75" dur="6.149">evacuating many of the individuals in</text>
  <text start="1108.84" dur="5.73">that area they&amp;#39;ve evacuated thousands</text>
  <text start="1111.899" dur="4.471">upon thousands of people and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1114.57" dur="3.9">interesting is that there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1116.37" dur="4.74">videos that are coming out showing</text>
  <text start="1118.47" dur="4.62">Russian bombardments in Syria and they</text>
  <text start="1121.11" dur="3.9">were made by militants but the corporate</text>
  <text start="1123.09" dur="3.6">media is using them without actually</text>
  <text start="1125.01" dur="3.93">checking their sources of where they</text>
  <text start="1126.69" dur="3.99">actually came from and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1128.94" dur="5.34">that Russia is bombarding the area</text>
  <text start="1130.68" dur="6.36">there&amp;#39;s people that are being hit and we</text>
  <text start="1134.28" dur="5.88">have you know the white helmets there</text>
  <text start="1137.04" dur="5.34">and Russia is in Aleppo Syria is in</text>
  <text start="1140.16" dur="5.81">Aleppo and they can&amp;#39;t find any of these</text>
  <text start="1142.38" dur="6.179">individuals there is nothing there and</text>
  <text start="1145.97" dur="5.62">according to civilians there was only</text>
  <text start="1148.559" dur="5.521">hunger and indiscriminate terror by</text>
  <text start="1151.59" dur="5.18">militants for any attempts to express</text>
  <text start="1154.08" dur="6.479">dissatisfaction or leave the Enclave and</text>
  <text start="1156.77" dur="5.86">we can see right now that the terrorists</text>
  <text start="1160.559" dur="5.311">were holding about a hundred civilians</text>
  <text start="1162.63" dur="5.97">hostage as human shields in this area</text>
  <text start="1165.87" dur="4.53">but of course what&amp;#39;s happening is the</text>
  <text start="1168.6" dur="3.24">narrative of the story is starting to</text>
  <text start="1170.4" dur="3.89">break down and the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="1171.84" dur="5.339">trying to push the narrative that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1174.29" dur="4.75">horrible it&amp;#39;s unbelievable what Syria</text>
  <text start="1177.179" dur="3.661">and Russia are doing in Aleppo but</text>
  <text start="1179.04" dur="5.66">what&amp;#39;s going to happen as the smoke</text>
  <text start="1180.84" dur="7.98">clears the truth is going to come out</text>
  <text start="1184.7" dur="7.06">now Turkey has built 89 new military</text>
  <text start="1188.82" dur="5.04">outposts on its Syria and Iraq border as</text>
  <text start="1191.76" dur="4.77">part of its efforts to strengthen the</text>
  <text start="1193.86" dur="5.64">country&amp;#39;s border security and Turkey has</text>
  <text start="1196.53" dur="4.56">built this concrete wall which is about</text>
  <text start="1199.5" dur="5.4">two hundred eighty seven kilometers or</text>
  <text start="1201.09" dur="6.87">178 miles long along the border the wall</text>
  <text start="1204.9" dur="6.32">will be maintained as a security</text>
  <text start="1207.96" dur="5.79">crossing for the Turkish border and</text>
  <text start="1211.22" dur="5.05">they&amp;#39;re still building more of this wall</text>
  <text start="1213.75" dur="6.6">now Turkey and Russia they are meeting</text>
  <text start="1216.27" dur="7.44">on Wednesday to discuss the situation in</text>
  <text start="1220.35" dur="7.05">Aleppo and maybe opening up a corridor</text>
  <text start="1223.71" dur="6.87">to evacuate the rebels and allowing</text>
  <text start="1227.4" dur="5.73">other individuals to leave and we can</text>
  <text start="1230.58" dur="5.16">see right now that Turkey is setting up</text>
  <text start="1233.13" dur="6.12">a tent city to accommodate about 80,000</text>
  <text start="1235.74" dur="8.25">Syrian refugees fleeing Aleppo and at</text>
  <text start="1239.25" dur="10.8">this point the Syrian forces the Russian</text>
  <text start="1243.99" dur="7.74">forces they have gained a strategic area</text>
  <text start="1250.05" dur="3.9">and the United States government central</text>
  <text start="1251.73" dur="5.28">bankers and their terrorist groups they</text>
  <text start="1253.95" dur="5.34">have lost the strategic area now when we</text>
  <text start="1257.01" dur="4.32">look at the situation we can see that</text>
  <text start="1259.29" dur="5.57">United States government the central</text>
  <text start="1261.33" dur="7.17">bankers the elite the shadow government</text>
  <text start="1264.86" dur="8.68">they&amp;#39;re backed into a corner now think</text>
  <text start="1268.5" dur="8.85">about it they have been working on their</text>
  <text start="1273.54" dur="6.27">goals to take the rights away from the</text>
  <text start="1277.35" dur="4.59">people to control the creation of</text>

  <text start="1300.87" dur="5.04">see their claws are coming out and</text>
  <text start="1303.44" dur="5.77">everyone should be a little nervous at</text>
