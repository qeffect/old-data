  <text start="52.35" dur="5.13">hi and welcome you listening to the x-22</text>
  <text start="55.98" dur="4.98">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="57.48" dur="6.09">episode 1367 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="60.96" dur="5.37">August 30th 2017 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="63.57" dur="5.97">episode is strange the Roth trial dumps</text>
  <text start="66.33" dur="5.01">a huge amount of US assets let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="69.54" dur="4.829">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="71.34" dur="5.639">news now ADP came out with their US</text>
  <text start="74.369" dur="3.871">economy report and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="76.979" dur="3.661">there was about two hundred and thirty</text>
  <text start="78.24" dur="4.26">seven thousand jobs added in August and</text>
  <text start="80.64" dur="4.35">also we need to remember they only</text>
  <text start="82.5" dur="4.979">expected 185 thousand so there were a</text>
  <text start="84.99" dur="4.53">lot more jobs that were added and they</text>
  <text start="87.479" dur="4.651">went back in time and they revised the</text>
  <text start="89.52" dur="5.31">July numbers and they did an upward</text>
  <text start="92.13" dur="5.76">revision now what we&amp;#39;re looking at right</text>
  <text start="94.83" dur="4.8">now is the manipulation is continuing</text>
  <text start="97.89" dur="4.019">that has not changed whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="99.63" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re continually manipulating these</text>
  <text start="101.909" dur="4.14">numbers to make it seem like the economy</text>
  <text start="104.49" dur="4.829">is doing a lot better than it really is</text>
  <text start="106.049" dur="7.74">so basically what we are seeing is that</text>
  <text start="109.319" dur="6.241">the BLS the ADP numbers they are still</text>
  <text start="113.789" dur="3.961">being manipulated to make it look like</text>
  <text start="115.56" dur="4.22">the economy&amp;#39;s doing very well and we</text>
  <text start="117.75" dur="5.189">need to remember a lot of these jobs</text>
  <text start="119.78" dur="6.1">well they&amp;#39;re the food service part-time</text>
  <text start="122.939" dur="4.68">positions and we can see right now with</text>
  <text start="125.88" dur="2.849">all the retail stores that are closing</text>
  <text start="127.619" dur="3.9">and all these people losing their jobs</text>
  <text start="128.729" dur="4.35">and manufacturing which is in trouble</text>
  <text start="131.519" dur="3.241">even though they&amp;#39;re telling us there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="133.079" dur="4.591">lot of manufacturing jobs that are added</text>
  <text start="134.76" dur="5.699">well think about this for a second the</text>
  <text start="137.67" dur="6.45">auto industry is in trouble they are in</text>
  <text start="140.459" dur="5.911">trouble and they can&amp;#39;t channel stuff the</text>
  <text start="144.12" dur="4.89">Lots anymore and to tell us that</text>
  <text start="146.37" dur="5.88">manufacturing jobs are increasing seems</text>
  <text start="149.01" dur="5.52">a little ridiculous at this time now we</text>
  <text start="152.25" dur="3.42">understand that many different sectors</text>
  <text start="154.53" dur="3.54">within the economy while they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="155.67" dur="5.34">completely falling apart and we know one</text>
  <text start="158.07" dur="6.69">of them is housing and we can spot a</text>
  <text start="161.01" dur="5.4">bubble a million miles away even though</text>
  <text start="164.76" dur="4.259">the Fed and everyone else is saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="166.41" dur="4.98">very difficult to recognize a bubble</text>
  <text start="169.019" dur="4.56">well bubbles are not that hard to</text>
  <text start="171.39" dur="4.069">recognize and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="173.579" dur="4.231">now is that there are many bubbles</text>
  <text start="175.459" dur="3.761">forming in the housing market and a lot</text>
  <text start="177.81" dur="3.66">of people say well how do you know</text>
  <text start="179.22" dur="4.769">there&amp;#39;s a bubble that forming in the</text>
  <text start="181.47" dur="4.29">housing markets well we looked at some</text>
  <text start="183.989" dur="4.771">information and</text>
  <text start="185.76" dur="5.16">we can find that in certain cities and</text>
  <text start="188.76" dur="4.53">remember bubbles happen locally we can</text>
  <text start="190.92" dur="5.73">see that bubbles are forming now once</text>
  <text start="193.29" dur="4.949">the index hits around 200 well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="196.65" dur="4.979">telling us that there is a bubble</text>
  <text start="198.239" dur="5.011">forming when it gets very close to 200</text>
  <text start="201.629" dur="4.531">we know it&amp;#39;s on its way now if we go</text>
  <text start="203.25" dur="5.34">back to housing bubble 1 and we look at</text>
  <text start="206.16" dur="6.87">some of the cities like for instance</text>
  <text start="208.59" dur="8.61">Boston that was at 180 so housing bubble</text>
  <text start="213.03" dur="8.34">one was at 180 and housing bubble 2 in</text>
  <text start="217.2" dur="6.84">Boston has already hit a 200 index so</text>
  <text start="221.37" dur="5.449">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a huge increase and</text>
  <text start="224.04" dur="6.69">it&amp;#39;s far above the housing bubble of</text>
  <text start="226.819" dur="6.191">2008 2007 2008 if we go ahead and we</text>
  <text start="230.73" dur="4.53">look at Seattle well they were looking</text>
  <text start="233.01" dur="6.599">at a 190 index and that was housing</text>
  <text start="235.26" dur="8.099">bubble number 1 Seattle is now at 230</text>
  <text start="239.609" dur="5.52">that is housing bubble number 2 so what</text>
  <text start="243.359" dur="3.841">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the percentage of</text>
  <text start="245.129" dur="4.801">these bubbles they have increased</text>
  <text start="247.2" dur="4.95">dramatically look at Denver for instance</text>
  <text start="249.93" dur="5.639">housing bubble number one it was over a</text>
  <text start="252.15" dur="8.79">hundred it was approaching 140 actually</text>
  <text start="255.569" dur="9.32">hit 140 and now Denver is at 200 way</text>
  <text start="260.94" dur="7.17">above 43 percent above what it was in</text>
  <text start="264.889" dur="5.71">housing bubble number 1 if we go to</text>
  <text start="268.11" dur="6.69">Dallas we see the same thing they were</text>
  <text start="270.599" dur="6.811">at like 125 or so now it&amp;#39;s at 180 a 42%</text>
  <text start="274.8" dur="5.04">increase so those individuals who say</text>
  <text start="277.41" dur="5.55">that you can&amp;#39;t spot a bubble while a</text>
  <text start="279.84" dur="5.25">bubble is very easy to spot and we see</text>
  <text start="282.96" dur="5.79">that these bubbles are much much larger</text>
  <text start="285.09" dur="5.28">than they were back in 2007-2008 the</text>
  <text start="288.75" dur="4.71">price is continually increased and we</text>
  <text start="290.37" dur="4.83">know that Case Shiller monitors these</text>
  <text start="293.46" dur="3.75">different cities we know that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="295.2" dur="4.83">been pumped up and we can see that these</text>
  <text start="297.21" dur="5.22">bubbles are definitely forming now we</text>
  <text start="300.03" dur="5.37">see that the second quarter GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="302.43" dur="4.919">they&amp;#39;ve been revised sharply higher to 3</text>
  <text start="305.4" dur="4.56">percent now this is the best in two</text>
  <text start="307.349" dur="5.581">years I mean it&amp;#39;s just unbelievable all</text>
  <text start="309.96" dur="4.53">of a sudden GDP is skyrocketing I mean</text>
  <text start="312.93" dur="3.69">there&amp;#39;s a huge amount of manipulation</text>
  <text start="314.49" dur="4.77">going on right now and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="316.62" dur="5.46">make us believe that GDP all of us</text>
  <text start="319.26" dur="4.98">got a lot better with the debt rising</text>
  <text start="322.08" dur="4.34">with automobile and manufacturing</text>
  <text start="324.24" dur="6.2">slowing down retail stores closing</text>
  <text start="326.42" dur="6.91">consumer consumer spending declining and</text>
  <text start="330.44" dur="6.58">we know that a lot of the GDP is made up</text>
  <text start="333.33" dur="5.73">of retail and that has been declining</text>
  <text start="337.02" dur="6.42">but the GDP numbers are going up it</text>
  <text start="339.06" dur="8.67">makes no sense now something very very</text>
  <text start="343.44" dur="8.64">interesting that the big bank bosses</text>
  <text start="347.73" dur="6.96">they are dumping their stocks now this</text>
  <text start="352.08" dur="4.41">is very interesting because they kind of</text>
  <text start="354.69" dur="4.26">know what is happening in the economy</text>
  <text start="356.49" dur="3.99">they have this inside information even</text>
  <text start="358.95" dur="6.03">though they&amp;#39;ll never admit to it and</text>
  <text start="360.48" dur="6.57">these executives they have been dumping</text>
  <text start="364.98" dur="4.74">a lot of their stocks now the</text>
  <text start="367.05" dur="6.3">too-big-to-fail banks like JP Morgan</text>
  <text start="369.72" dur="7.34">Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley well what</text>
  <text start="373.35" dur="7.65">do we see we see them dumping stock and</text>
  <text start="377.06" dur="6.91">they must realize that as the economy</text>
  <text start="381" dur="4.26">moves up there is a period of time where</text>
  <text start="383.97" dur="2.82">the account where the I mean I should</text>
  <text start="385.26" dur="3.81">say the stock market as the stock market</text>
  <text start="386.79" dur="4.59">moves up they&amp;#39;re realizing that</text>
  <text start="389.07" dur="3.69">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen and it</text>
  <text start="391.38" dur="3.69">looks like it might be coming very soon</text>
  <text start="392.76" dur="4.98">because they&amp;#39;re starting to dump what</text>
  <text start="395.07" dur="5.1">they have I mean they have a total sold</text>
  <text start="397.74" dur="5.07">net of about nine point three two</text>
  <text start="400.17" dur="4.62">million shares at the open at the open</text>
  <text start="402.81" dur="5.73">market since the turn of the year so</text>
  <text start="404.79" dur="5.28">they realize that yeah it&amp;#39;s not good for</text>
  <text start="408.54" dur="3.9">them to stay in the market because they</text>
  <text start="410.07" dur="5.88">understand and they realize that it will</text>
  <text start="412.44" dur="6.33">be coming down so what are we seeing</text>
  <text start="415.95" dur="5.46">right now we&amp;#39;re seeing all these bubbles</text>
  <text start="418.77" dur="5.7">in the market student loan bubble</text>
  <text start="421.41" dur="5.55">automobile loan bubble housing bubble I</text>
  <text start="424.47" dur="5.94">mean this is starting to look like a</text>
  <text start="426.96" dur="6.75">complete repeat of 2008 but these</text>
  <text start="430.41" dur="5.31">bubbles are much larger they&amp;#39;re much</text>
  <text start="433.71" dur="5.13">bigger than they were before</text>
  <text start="435.72" dur="6.3">which tells us that the crash is going</text>
  <text start="438.84" dur="6.48">to be that much bigger and we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="442.02" dur="5.61">seeing signs of this where there are</text>
  <text start="445.32" dur="5.52">many people out there who cannot sell</text>
  <text start="447.63" dur="5.19">their homes so the numbers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="450.84" dur="4.05">throwing at us actually</text>
  <text start="452.82" dur="6.45">don&amp;#39;t make sense now there is another</text>
  <text start="454.89" dur="7.8">indicator the Rothschild Bank and this</text>
  <text start="459.27" dur="5.19">is the RIT Capital Partners and Lord</text>
  <text start="462.69" dur="4.29">Jacob brought trial founder and chairman</text>
  <text start="464.46" dur="7.67">of RT capital partners they have</text>
  <text start="466.98" dur="9.06">minimized their exposure to risky</text>
  <text start="472.13" dur="5.83">unstable US capital market so in the</text>
  <text start="476.04" dur="4.62">half yearly financial report for the art</text>
  <text start="477.96" dur="4.17">RIT Capital Partners they explained that</text>
  <text start="480.66" dur="4.38">the company&amp;#39;s aggressive moves to</text>
  <text start="482.13" dur="5.52">significantly reduce exposure to the US</text>
  <text start="485.04" dur="5.46">assets because they believe that QE</text>
  <text start="487.65" dur="4.73">quantitative quantitative easing well</text>
  <text start="490.5" dur="4.23">that&amp;#39;s going to come to an end</text>
  <text start="492.38" dur="4.42">central banks are going to pull back and</text>
  <text start="494.73" dur="4.11">really what they&amp;#39;re saying is that these</text>
  <text start="496.8" dur="4.11">this economy that were in this global</text>
  <text start="498.84" dur="4.86">economy that we&amp;#39;re in it&amp;#39;s going to come</text>
  <text start="500.91" dur="4.74">crashing down and we can see that this</text>
  <text start="503.7" dur="4.56">is definitely what&amp;#39;s going to happen and</text>
  <text start="505.65" dur="6.48">it is going to be a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="508.26" dur="5.82">disaster so we&amp;#39;re getting a lot of</text>
  <text start="512.13" dur="4.08">indicators not just economic indicators</text>
  <text start="514.08" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;re getting indicators from the</text>
  <text start="516.21" dur="5.04">insider insiders letting us know that</text>
  <text start="518.88" dur="4.56">something is going on here and this is</text>
  <text start="521.25" dur="3.6">why we&amp;#39;ve been saying for a very long</text>
  <text start="523.44" dur="3.42">time that you need to be ready and</text>
  <text start="524.85" dur="3.6">prepared because believe me a lot of</text>
  <text start="526.86" dur="3.57">people think that oh don&amp;#39;t worry this</text>
  <text start="528.45" dur="4.02">economy is going to continue on we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="530.43" dur="4.62">have to worry about it nothing&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="532.47" dur="3.3">happen nothing will go wrong and I&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="535.05" dur="3.03">ok</text>
  <text start="535.77" dur="6.03">because nothing has gone wrong for a</text>
  <text start="538.08" dur="6.42">very long time well when it does go</text>
  <text start="541.8" dur="4.92">wrong what are you going to do are you</text>
  <text start="544.5" dur="4.26">gonna go and look back in time and say</text>
  <text start="546.72" dur="4.26">oh I should have done this well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="548.76" dur="3.24">going to be too late you&amp;#39;re not gonna be</text>
  <text start="550.98" dur="2.52">able to get food you&amp;#39;re not gonna be</text>
  <text start="552" dur="2.97">able to get water most likely you won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="553.5" dur="4.71">be able to take your funds out of the</text>
  <text start="554.97" dur="5.64">bank you&amp;#39;ll have nothing to ensure your</text>
  <text start="558.21" dur="4.44">wealth and just because something&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="560.61" dur="5.55">going on which has been manipulated for</text>
  <text start="562.65" dur="5.64">a very long time doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="566.16" dur="5.37">to last forever what we have been</text>
  <text start="568.29" dur="7.79">following all these years is to show</text>
  <text start="571.53" dur="8.58">that show how this economy is slowly</text>
  <text start="576.08" dur="7.66">grinding into a crash scenario it</text>
  <text start="580.11" dur="6.3">doesn&amp;#39;t happen overnight it takes a very</text>
  <text start="583.74" dur="4.68">long time to blow these bubbles up</text>
  <text start="586.41" dur="4.71">to make people think that the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="588.42" dur="5.76">doing well to get the majority of the</text>
  <text start="591.12" dur="6.029">people into the system this is how the</text>
  <text start="594.18" dur="5.159">central bankers work they don&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="597.149" dur="5.73">want to crash the economy they want to</text>
  <text start="599.339" dur="5.071">steal your wealth and if they can&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="602.879" dur="3.541">you believe that the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="604.41" dur="3.179">well well you&amp;#39;re not going to invest in</text>
  <text start="606.42" dur="3">the stock market you&amp;#39;re not gonna go out</text>
  <text start="607.589" dur="4.141">and purchase a house you&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="609.42" dur="6.39">take out a student loan this is what</text>
  <text start="611.73" dur="5.909">they want everyone to do and this is</text>
  <text start="615.81" dur="3.99">what they&amp;#39;ve done over the many many</text>
  <text start="617.639" dur="5.55">years and now we&amp;#39;re reaching that point</text>
  <text start="619.8" dur="4.95">where things are coming apart I mean</text>
  <text start="623.189" dur="3.33">we&amp;#39;ve been following it I mean look at</text>
  <text start="624.75" dur="3.66">what look at what we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="626.519" dur="4.37">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at housing we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="628.41" dur="4.859">looking at retail they&amp;#39;re falling apart</text>
  <text start="630.889" dur="4.06">things are rapidly deteriorating very</text>
  <text start="633.269" dur="4.141">very quickly they had to keep the</text>
  <text start="634.949" dur="4.471">interest rates near zero percent they</text>
  <text start="637.41" dur="6.09">really couldn&amp;#39;t push them up any further</text>
  <text start="639.42" dur="7.38">than that they offloaded inflation into</text>
  <text start="643.5" dur="7.1">colleges into medical insurance into</text>
  <text start="646.8" dur="7.17">housing into stock market into other</text>
  <text start="650.6" dur="6.13">areas around the world to make it look</text>
  <text start="653.97" dur="6.9">like there&amp;#39;s really no inflation here</text>
  <text start="656.73" dur="6.839">the dollar is stable the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="660.87" dur="5.88">one gigantic illusion it&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="663.569" dur="5.401">illusion back in 2008 when they told</text>
  <text start="666.75" dur="5.43">everyone the subprime securities were</text>
  <text start="668.97" dur="4.919">perfectly fine their triple-a there&amp;#39;s</text>
