  <text start="261.62" dur="5.64">corporate media and the Fed and the US</text>
  <text start="264.8" dur="5.52">government makes you think that this</text>
  <text start="267.26" dur="5.85">illusion is real and what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="270.32" dur="6.72">seeing is that it is no way real</text>

  <text start="325.3" dur="7.47">led the company as sales plummeted and</text>
  <text start="329.05" dur="6.87">it spiraled into insolvency so they are</text>
  <text start="332.77" dur="6.96">getting a bonus for destroying the</text>

  <text start="375.04" dur="5.13">bonuses but you don&amp;#39;t have enough money</text>
  <text start="377.08" dur="5.76">to give us a severance package I mean</text>
  <text start="380.17" dur="4.5">when we calculate this out each one of</text>
  <text start="382.84" dur="5.15">these executives they&amp;#39;re getting a</text>
  <text start="384.67" dur="5.88">hundred and seventy-six thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="387.99" dur="5.83">this is what their bonus is going to be</text>

  <text start="406.66" dur="5.01">fleeing the state and this is going to</text>
  <text start="409.63" dur="3.69">be a problem because remember this is</text>

  <text start="413.32" dur="3.45">generation that&amp;#39;s supposed to be</text>
  <text start="414.46" dur="3.39">purchasing homes in this state this is</text>

  <text start="457.03" dur="4.36">this is not going to help the state</text>
  <text start="459.44" dur="4.8">whatsoever and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="461.39" dur="3.81">that you know a lot of these states not</text>
  <text start="464.24" dur="3.12">just Illinois we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>

  <text start="467.36" dur="5.99">others they&amp;#39;re going to be in a lot of</text>
  <text start="469.43" dur="7.59">trouble and don&amp;#39;t forget a lot of states</text>
  <text start="473.35" dur="6.55">they have a pension crisis headed their</text>
  <text start="477.02" dur="6.15">way we see auto defaults well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="479.9" dur="5.73">soaring to the post-crisis highs even as</text>
  <text start="483.17" dur="4.65">equity markets continue to struggle off</text>
  <text start="485.63" dur="3.9">this bad data they don&amp;#39;t care it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="487.82" dur="3.93">make a difference to them everything is</text>
  <text start="489.53" dur="4.74">fine but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="491.75" dur="4.74">that there&amp;#39;s more and more individuals</text>
  <text start="494.27" dur="4.8">that are default defaulting on their</text>
  <text start="496.49" dur="4.92">auto loans delinquencies they are</text>
  <text start="499.07" dur="4.38">skyrocketing now and we can see the</text>
  <text start="501.41" dur="3.84">economic data it is just getting worse</text>
  <text start="503.45" dur="3.21">and worse and worse and out in the</text>
  <text start="505.25" dur="3.9">corporate media they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="506.66" dur="5.28">us believe that there is tons and tons</text>
  <text start="509.15" dur="6.59">of job openings but we just can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="511.94" dur="5.87">qualified workers to work in these jobs</text>
  <text start="515.74" dur="5.23">well we have a hundred million people</text>
  <text start="517.81" dur="5.35">that are looking for jobs we have many</text>
  <text start="520.97" dur="3.9">others that are in part-time jobs that</text>
  <text start="523.16" dur="3.18">would like to have a full-time job but</text>
  <text start="524.87" dur="3.06">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this and</text>
  <text start="526.34" dur="4.2">for those who work in the corporate</text>
  <text start="527.93" dur="4.89">world you understand that there are</text>
  <text start="530.54" dur="4.68">departments that have open wrecks now</text>
  <text start="532.82" dur="3.69">they leave these wrecks open even though</text>
  <text start="535.22" dur="3.24">there&amp;#39;s a hiring freeze</text>
  <text start="536.51" dur="3.96">they still interview people because</text>
  <text start="538.46" dur="4.23">eventually they don&amp;#39;t want to lose these</text>
  <text start="540.47" dur="5.34">open wrecks so they interview people but</text>
  <text start="542.69" dur="6.21">they can&amp;#39;t give anyone a job secondly</text>
  <text start="545.81" dur="8.01">we&amp;#39;ve been watching the wage growth</text>
  <text start="548.9" dur="7.17">basically slowed and decline now wages</text>
  <text start="553.82" dur="4.8">are continually declining and when you</text>
  <text start="556.07" dur="5.1">cannot find qualified workers when</text>
  <text start="558.62" dur="5.52">there&amp;#39;s a shortage well it&amp;#39;s not an</text>
  <text start="561.17" dur="6.18">employer market it&amp;#39;s an employee market</text>
  <text start="564.14" dur="4.05">where listen you can&amp;#39;t find qualified</text>
  <text start="567.35" dur="4.29">people</text>
  <text start="568.19" dur="6.36">well I&amp;#39;m qualified and the salary that</text>
  <text start="571.64" dur="6.45">you&amp;#39;re asking is not enough and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="574.55" dur="5.79">seen this back in the past where in the</text>
  <text start="578.09" dur="3.75">tech boom they couldn&amp;#39;t find qualified</text>
  <text start="580.34" dur="3.51">people they couldn&amp;#39;t find database</text>
  <text start="581.84" dur="3.3">people they couldn&amp;#39;t find webmasters</text>
  <text start="583.85" dur="2.489">they couldn&amp;#39;t find Windows</text>
  <text start="585.14" dur="3.059">administrators</text>
  <text start="586.339" dur="4.11">and what they did is they kept raising</text>
  <text start="588.199" dur="5.58">the salary until they found those</text>
  <text start="590.449" dur="5.31">qualified people because there was a</text>
  <text start="593.779" dur="4.35">shortage of those individuals they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="595.759" dur="5.101">telling us there&amp;#39;s a shortage so they</text>
  <text start="598.129" dur="5.4">should be wait raising the wages right</text>
  <text start="600.86" dur="5.31">now but there&amp;#39;s a problem</text>
  <text start="603.529" dur="6.8">they&amp;#39;re not raising the wages for these</text>
  <text start="606.17" dur="6.81">positions so something is off here</text>
  <text start="610.329" dur="6.37">something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense once again</text>
  <text start="612.98" dur="8.13">and we can see that most likely it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="616.699" dur="6.45">this data it&amp;#39;s the lie that there are so</text>
  <text start="621.11" dur="4.339">many jobs that are open right now they</text>
  <text start="623.149" dur="4.38">just can&amp;#39;t find these individuals and</text>
  <text start="625.449" dur="3.43">they were never going to fill these</text>
  <text start="627.529" dur="3.99">positions in the first place because</text>
  <text start="628.879" dur="5.58">there&amp;#39;s a hiring freeze which a lot of</text>
  <text start="631.519" dur="4.86">corporations do do I mean as they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="634.459" dur="4.5">laying off individuals they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="636.379" dur="5.25">to be hiring people they usually put a</text>
  <text start="638.959" dur="5.581">freeze on hiring when they&amp;#39;re laying off</text>
  <text start="641.629" dur="4.68">and this is what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing and</text>
  <text start="644.54" dur="4.38">remember we&amp;#39;ve been seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="646.309" dur="4.741">retail a lot of corporate office in the</text>
  <text start="648.92" dur="4.529">retail sector laying off individuals so</text>
  <text start="651.05" dur="4.44">all these people they would like to get</text>
  <text start="653.449" dur="3.541">another high paying job and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="655.49" dur="3.329">working in the industry for a very long</text>
  <text start="656.99" dur="3.389">time so they should be qualified for</text>
  <text start="658.819" dur="4.08">some type of job especially in the</text>
  <text start="660.379" dur="5.63">corporate offices in the tech in the</text>
  <text start="662.899" dur="5.31">management area in the finance area</text>
  <text start="666.009" dur="5.32">these people should be pretty darn</text>
  <text start="668.209" dur="5.13">qualified but again individuals are</text>
  <text start="671.329" dur="4.1">still having a trouble trying to find</text>
  <text start="673.339" dur="6.511">work now the Empire State manufacturing</text>

  <text start="893.53" dur="4.95">had set a careful budget for themselves</text>
  <text start="895.6" dur="4.65">to begin with the savings comes from a</text>
  <text start="898.48" dur="5.46">cut in the amount spent on Michelle</text>
  <text start="900.25" dur="6.59">Obama&amp;#39;s budget as first lady an end to</text>

  <text start="944.53" dur="5.75">nearly two million annually up from 1.4</text>
  <text start="947.8" dur="4.89">million spent during george w bush</text>
  <text start="950.28" dur="4.21">another area of savings was the</text>

  <text start="974.95" dur="4.74">eight thousand dollars annually so what</text>
  <text start="977.26" dur="4.2">is happening right now is that each part</text>
  <text start="979.69" dur="3.78">of the government is going to be cutting</text>
  <text start="981.46" dur="3.15">cutting cutting because when this reset</text>
  <text start="983.47" dur="3.65">comes there</text>
  <text start="984.61" dur="4.8">is going to be no funds for this</text>
  <text start="987.12" dur="4.51">everything&amp;#39;s going to have to be reset</text>
