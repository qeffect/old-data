  <text start="88.009" dur="6.211">was fantastic retail sales are up by 0.4</text>
  <text start="91.13" dur="5.91">percent but we need to remember how they</text>
  <text start="94.22" dur="5.22">calculate all this remember they include</text>
  <text start="97.04" dur="6.18">gas prices gas has gone up a little bit</text>

  <text start="108.649" dur="6.841">include gas prices in the holiday season</text>
  <text start="111.46" dur="5.949">retail numbers and then you have car</text>
  <text start="115.49" dur="4.59">sales and we know how they calculate car</text>
  <text start="117.409" dur="5.82">sales if the manufacturer delivers the</text>
  <text start="120.08" dur="5.88">cars to the lot well that counts as a</text>
  <text start="123.229" dur="5.57">sale so can you really count that if you</text>
  <text start="125.96" dur="6.9">strip that away what we&amp;#39;re looking at is</text>
  <text start="128.799" dur="8.591">numbers that are absolutely awful and it</text>
  <text start="132.86" dur="7.95">shows that the retail holiday season was</text>
  <text start="137.39" dur="5.28">absolutely awful we look at Lowe&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="140.81" dur="3.69">there was insider information saying</text>
  <text start="142.67" dur="3.599">that Lowe&amp;#39;s was gonna lay off around 15</text>
  <text start="144.5" dur="4.92">to 20 thousand people they&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="146.269" dur="7.741">started they&amp;#39;re getting rid of 2,400</text>
  <text start="149.42" dur="6.72">full-time employees and Lowe&amp;#39;s is the</text>
  <text start="154.01" dur="4.979">nation&amp;#39;s second biggest home improvement</text>
  <text start="156.14" dur="6.629">retailer behind home depot and what</text>
  <text start="158.989" dur="8.401">they&amp;#39;ve seen is that the customer</text>
  <text start="162.769" dur="7.291">traffic has slowed quite a bit which</text>
  <text start="167.39" dur="4.8">tells us that there might be a problem</text>
  <text start="170.06" dur="5.91">in construction which might be a problem</text>
  <text start="172.19" dur="5.729">in home sales we see target right now</text>
  <text start="175.97" dur="4.68">well it&amp;#39;s cutting its fourth-quarter</text>
  <text start="177.919" dur="3.541">profit sales they&amp;#39;re saying that there</text>
  <text start="180.65" dur="3.06">was it was</text>
  <text start="181.46" dur="5.1">very sluggish holiday sales and store</text>
  <text start="183.71" dur="8.16">traffic was not there even their online</text>
  <text start="186.56" dur="10.76">sales not showing a strong holiday</text>
  <text start="191.87" dur="9.33">season and the holiday season was very</text>
  <text start="197.32" dur="7.65">disappointing for target and then we</text>
  <text start="201.2" dur="6.69">have Macy&amp;#39;s where there&amp;#39;s a retail</text>
  <text start="204.97" dur="4.36">insider a retailer insider who saying</text>
  <text start="207.89" dur="3.84">that Macy&amp;#39;s actually is going to be</text>
  <text start="209.33" dur="6.03">closing most likely another hundred</text>
  <text start="211.73" dur="5.88">stores and think about what happened</text>
  <text start="215.36" dur="6.54">already with Macy&amp;#39;s they closed 68</text>
  <text start="217.61" dur="8.07">stores ten thousand job cuts and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="221.9" dur="6.93">about to do this probably once again and</text>
  <text start="225.68" dur="4.86">then we have Tiffany &amp;amp; Company now</text>
  <text start="228.83" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re blaming all their problems on</text>
  <text start="230.54" dur="6.41">Trump they&amp;#39;re saying that their sales</text>
  <text start="234.2" dur="6.05">have dropped because of the election and</text>
  <text start="236.95" dur="8.11">we have to understand that Tiffany well</text>
  <text start="240.25" dur="7.92">they are on Fifth Avenue they&amp;#39;re on the</text>
  <text start="245.06" dur="5.52">side where Trump Tower and Gucci is and</text>
  <text start="248.17" dur="5.17">they&amp;#39;re saying that their flagship store</text>
  <text start="250.58" dur="4.11">well they lost sales because of all the</text>
  <text start="253.34" dur="3">roadblocks and things like that because</text>
  <text start="254.69" dur="3.299">of the barricades the protesters the</text>
  <text start="256.34" dur="2.82">tourists the journalists and everything</text>
  <text start="257.989" dur="3.211">else that was going on people who can</text>
  <text start="259.16" dur="5.22">get to their store and they said we had</text>
  <text start="261.2" dur="7.77">a 14% decline at the company&amp;#39;s flagship</text>
  <text start="264.38" dur="6.63">store on Fifth Avenue but that&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="268.97" dur="4.59">only reason they&amp;#39;re there sales have</text>
  <text start="271.01" dur="5.1">dropped yes they&amp;#39;re using this as an</text>
  <text start="273.56" dur="7.53">excuse but they have more than one store</text>
  <text start="276.11" dur="7.47">and when you look you can see that well</text>
  <text start="281.09" dur="4.92">sales have been dropping in other places</text>
  <text start="283.58" dur="5.49">so when we look we see that there was a</text>
  <text start="286.01" dur="5.94">4% drop in the Americas in Asian Pacific</text>
  <text start="289.07" dur="5.64">region and a decline of about 11 percent</text>
  <text start="291.95" dur="4.89">in Europe the company right now does not</text>
  <text start="294.71" dur="7.08">expect any significant improvement in</text>
  <text start="296.84" dur="7.98">2017 tiffany worldwide comparable store</text>
  <text start="301.79" dur="5.76">sales fell two percent year-on-year so</text>
  <text start="304.82" dur="5.79">is it really because of the elections</text>
  <text start="307.55" dur="6">because of Trump no sales are declining</text>
  <text start="310.61" dur="4.74">in retail we&amp;#39;re seeing it all over the</text>
  <text start="313.55" dur="4.28">place remember the</text>
  <text start="315.35" dur="5.16">are people being laid off left and right</text>
  <text start="317.83" dur="4.72">people losing their high-paying jobs</text>
  <text start="320.51" dur="5.01">actually I know two people who just lost</text>
  <text start="322.55" dur="5.34">their jobs one on Wall Street and one in</text>
  <text start="325.52" dur="4.41">a different company which is not on Wall</text>
  <text start="327.89" dur="4.53">Street and it happened in the same week</text>
  <text start="329.93" dur="4.89">which is completely unbelievable and</text>
  <text start="332.42" dur="5.49">they didn&amp;#39;t see it coming at all and</text>
  <text start="334.82" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re worried because they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="337.91" dur="4.17">to find another job and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="339.71" dur="5.01">putting out resumes and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="342.08" dur="4.65">hmm it seems like there&amp;#39;s a problem out</text>
  <text start="344.72" dur="4.35">there because no one&amp;#39;s getting back to</text>
  <text start="346.73" dur="5.43">me and again you don&amp;#39;t notice these</text>
  <text start="349.07" dur="7.53">things until you&amp;#39;re in that position</text>
  <text start="352.16" dur="7.68">where you&amp;#39;re looking for that job we see</text>
  <text start="356.6" dur="5.94">right now that real average weekly</text>
  <text start="359.84" dur="4.53">earnings rose only 0.2 percent</text>
  <text start="362.54" dur="5.52">year-over-year in December the weakest</text>
  <text start="364.37" dur="6.57">growth since 2014 that means the average</text>
  <text start="368.06" dur="4.71">weekly earnings well it really hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="370.94" dur="5.34">gone up now think about this for a</text>
  <text start="372.77" dur="5.82">second when Obama took office the real</text>
  <text start="376.28" dur="5.28">average weekly earnings was growing</text>
  <text start="378.59" dur="6.42">around 2.5 percent year on year as he</text>
  <text start="381.56" dur="6.48">leaves office it is growing just that</text>
  <text start="385.01" dur="3.96">0.2 percent year on year we have a</text>
  <text start="388.04" dur="4.47">problem here</text>
  <text start="388.97" dur="6.57">well how did this happen why are wages</text>
  <text start="392.51" dur="5.91">going down because the high paying jobs</text>
  <text start="395.54" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re disappearing people are taking</text>
  <text start="398.42" dur="4.98">lower paying jobs which is part-time</text>
  <text start="400.82" dur="5.25">retail food service type of jobs or</text>
  <text start="403.4" dur="4.77">people can&amp;#39;t find jobs at all and when</text>
  <text start="406.07" dur="4.68">you average it all out people are making</text>
  <text start="408.17" dur="4.02">less actually in the high paying jobs</text>
  <text start="410.75" dur="3">when someone is trying to move from</text>
  <text start="412.19" dur="4.2">company to company they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="413.75" dur="4.44">realize that hey wait a minute you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="416.39" dur="3.99">gonna pay me less for the job that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="418.19" dur="4.83">working at right now this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="420.38" dur="5.61">happening throughout the country right</text>
  <text start="423.02" dur="6.35">now and people are starting to wake up</text>
  <text start="425.99" dur="6.12">to this we see home builder confidence</text>
  <text start="429.37" dur="5.61">came back to earth in January after</text>
  <text start="432.11" dur="6.63">service urging to an 11-year high on</text>
  <text start="434.98" dur="6.97">Donald Trump&amp;#39;s presidential victory now</text>
  <text start="438.74" dur="5.13">again a lot of this stuff is just a</text>
  <text start="441.95" dur="4.05">flash in the pan here where all of a</text>
  <text start="443.87" dur="3.81">sudden something just skyrockets and</text>
  <text start="446" dur="3.24">then things level off and once again and</text>
  <text start="447.68" dur="5.639">we see already</text>
  <text start="449.24" dur="7.38">that homebuilders confidence well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="453.319" dur="4.861">going back to normal and of course what</text>
  <text start="456.62" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re seeing all over the place is</text>
  <text start="458.18" dur="5.34">things are actually going back to normal</text>
  <text start="461.12" dur="4.169">because now reality sets in and says</text>
  <text start="463.52" dur="4.2">okay nothing&amp;#39;s really changed in the</text>
  <text start="465.289" dur="4.741">economy everything is exactly the same</text>
  <text start="467.72" dur="5.49">stores are closing left to right</text>
  <text start="470.03" dur="4.919">people are being laid off and we still</text>
  <text start="473.21" dur="4.049">have this debt people aren&amp;#39;t buying</text>
  <text start="474.949" dur="4.351">houses we still have the same problems</text>
  <text start="477.259" dur="4.47">nothing has changed</text>
  <text start="479.3" dur="4.739">now a US appeals court on ones that</text>
  <text start="481.729" dur="5.731">revived a lawsuit by the Federal Deposit</text>
  <text start="484.039" dur="5.761">Insurance Corporation against five banks</text>
  <text start="487.46" dur="4.019">including credit Swiss stemming from</text>
  <text start="489.8" dur="3.48">these sales of the mortgage-backed</text>
  <text start="491.479" dur="6.571">securities ahead of the 2008 financial</text>
  <text start="493.28" dur="7.08">crisis the second US Circuit Court of</text>
  <text start="498.05" dur="5.82">Appeals in New York ruled that a lower</text>
  <text start="500.36" dur="7.23">court judge well they might have erred</text>
  <text start="503.87" dur="7.109">in dismissing the FDIC lawsuit and the</text>
  <text start="507.59" dur="7.65">lawsuit also names HSBC World Bank of</text>
  <text start="510.979" dur="8.011">Scotland Group UBS Deutsche Bank and the</text>
  <text start="515.24" dur="6.419">ruling back in March of 2015 was made by</text>
  <text start="518.99" dur="5.52">US District Judge Laura Keller Swain in</text>
  <text start="521.659" dur="5.251">Manhattan who said the FDIC had waited</text>
  <text start="524.51" dur="4.17">too long to sue the bank and the appeals</text>
  <text start="526.91" dur="5.31">court said well no they didn&amp;#39;t wait too</text>
  <text start="528.68" dur="6.93">long and they reinstated the lawsuit and</text>
  <text start="532.22" dur="4.71">these banks are now being sued we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="535.61" dur="4.07">have to see what comes out of these</text>
  <text start="536.93" dur="5.76">lawsuits but once again we can see that</text>
  <text start="539.68" dur="6.58">at least something is being done is it</text>
  <text start="542.69" dur="6.089">gonna change anything absolutely not we</text>
  <text start="546.26" dur="4.41">see us manufacturing output stagnated</text>
  <text start="548.779" dur="5.911">for fourteenth month in a row in</text>
  <text start="550.67" dur="6.38">December and it rose a mere 0.2 percent</text>
  <text start="554.69" dur="5.45">now the corporate media is out there</text>
  <text start="557.05" dur="6.039">saying that manufacturing is back</text>
  <text start="560.14" dur="5.47">industrial production is back and yes</text>
  <text start="563.089" dur="3.841">industrial production well it moved up a</text>
  <text start="565.61" dur="3.84">little bit for the first time since</text>
  <text start="566.93" dur="5.279">August of 2015 but we need to put all</text>
  <text start="569.45" dur="4.199">this in perspective when we look at</text>
  <text start="572.209" dur="3.87">manufacturing and industrial production</text>
  <text start="573.649" dur="6.211">well they&amp;#39;ve been in the negative range</text>
  <text start="576.079" dur="6.171">zero range for quite a while during the</text>
  <text start="579.86" dur="7.06">height of our economic</text>
  <text start="582.25" dur="12.66">boom prior to 2008 well manufacturing</text>
  <text start="586.92" dur="10.96">that was around 5% in 2010 we are</text>
  <text start="594.91" dur="6.42">anywhere between 5 and 8 percent and</text>
  <text start="597.88" dur="6.3">then it dropped off dropped off dropped</text>
  <text start="601.33" dur="4.34">off and here we are now and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="604.18" dur="5.55">telling us it&amp;#39;s the best thing ever</text>
  <text start="605.67" dur="7.39">since it moved up 2.2% an industrial</text>
  <text start="609.73" dur="7.23">production moved up a little bit well</text>
  <text start="613.06" dur="6.66">that&amp;#39;s not a recovery that means that</text>
  <text start="616.96" dur="7.44">we&amp;#39;re hovering around zero coming off</text>
  <text start="619.72" dur="6.42">negative numbers and this is not reality</text>
  <text start="624.4" dur="4.86">actually if we look at the manufacturing</text>
  <text start="626.14" dur="6.84">output it is declining when we look at</text>
  <text start="629.26" dur="6.9">the soft survey well again it&amp;#39;s a survey</text>
  <text start="632.98" dur="7.47">that&amp;#39;s increasing so what do you believe</text>
  <text start="636.16" dur="6.33">the hard data or the survey that the</text>
  <text start="640.45" dur="3.66">government likes to push out there well</text>
  <text start="642.49" dur="3.47">I&amp;#39;m gonna go with the hard data because</text>
  <text start="644.11" dur="4.95">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="645.96" dur="5.49">manufacturing well it&amp;#39;s not doing well</text>
  <text start="649.06" dur="7.38">whatsoever</text>
  <text start="651.45" dur="8.47">we see econo matters they are out there</text>
  <text start="656.44" dur="7.17">saying that the financial system is</text>
  <text start="659.92" dur="6.03">about to crash and they took matters</text>
  <text start="663.61" dur="5.49">into their own hands and they down growt</text>
  <text start="665.95" dur="5.43">downgraded the entire global credit</text>
  <text start="669.1" dur="3.84">rating to junk status since none of the</text>
  <text start="671.38" dur="4.55">rating agencies are doing their job</text>
  <text start="672.94" dur="6.69">right now and we know back going back to</text>
  <text start="675.93" dur="6.37">2007 going back to 2008 Standard and</text>
  <text start="679.63" dur="4.65">Poor&amp;#39;s Moody&amp;#39;s well they get paid from</text>
  <text start="682.3" dur="6.99">these companies to keep the ratings up</text>
  <text start="684.28" dur="6.54">and we know that they lied about these</text>
  <text start="689.29" dur="4.28">subprime securities they were not</text>
  <text start="690.82" dur="6.24">triple-a but they kept them there and</text>
  <text start="693.57" dur="6.97">econo Matters are saying that well the</text>
  <text start="697.06" dur="5.91">economy is really not doing as well as</text>
  <text start="700.54" dur="5.31">everyone is saying they&amp;#39;re saying look</text>
  <text start="702.97" dur="6.9">at how much each country government</text>
  <text start="705.85" dur="6.74">central bank look what they had to do to</text>
  <text start="709.87" dur="5.85">keep everything running doubling</text>
  <text start="712.59" dur="3.8">quintuple and in China&amp;#39;s case increasing</text>
  <text start="715.72" dur="3.07">their credible</text>
  <text start="716.39" dur="5.37">by a factor of 30 times the pre</text>
  <text start="718.79" dur="5.28">financial crisis levels the identifying</text>
  <text start="721.76" dur="3.93">markers of the coming debt Armageddon</text>
  <text start="724.07" dur="4.769">and global financial market crash are</text>
  <text start="725.69" dur="6.12">starting to surface and nobody is paying</text>

  <text start="1026.01" dur="5.46">what would exist in a more unhampered</text>
  <text start="1028.56" dur="4.769">market there is even reason to think</text>
  <text start="1031.47" dur="7.59">that it would be worse in the long run</text>

  <text start="1060.83" dur="5.59">non-productive activities and we have to</text>
  <text start="1064.08" dur="5.21">look back in time look what the central</text>
  <text start="1066.42" dur="5.49">bank has done has anything really</text>
  <text start="1069.29" dur="5.35">created more jobs and everything that</text>
  <text start="1071.91" dur="6.66">they&amp;#39;ve done they created currency they</text>
  <text start="1074.64" dur="7.77">made the bank&amp;#39;s better off they bailed</text>
  <text start="1078.57" dur="8.66">out companies but what have they done</text>
  <text start="1082.41" dur="6.9">for the everyday person nothing actually</text>
  <text start="1087.23" dur="5.08">more people have fallen off the</text>
  <text start="1089.31" dur="6.18">workforce than ever before the rest of</text>
  <text start="1092.31" dur="5.34">the data is completely fictional but</text>
  <text start="1095.49" dur="6.6">Yellen is out there saying that the</text>

  <text start="1137.289" dur="9.051">this latter half of 2017 things might go</text>
  <text start="1141.73" dur="8.28">wrong because we were on a recovery</text>

  <text start="1150.01" dur="4.62">which is going to be a problem so the</text>
  <text start="1152.799" dur="2.791">markets have a very good chance of</text>
  <text start="1154.63" dur="4.5">coming down</text>
