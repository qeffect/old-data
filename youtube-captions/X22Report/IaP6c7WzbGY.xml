  <text start="74.92" dur="4.47">and geopolitical news now we know that</text>
  <text start="77.08" dur="5.25">Trump has been out there and he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="79.39" dur="5.43">calling CNN fake news and Project</text>
  <text start="82.33" dur="5.34">Veritas well it looks like they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="84.82" dur="5.61">it again this time the organization led</text>
  <text start="87.67" dur="6.24">by James O&amp;#39;Keefe well he&amp;#39;s infiltrated</text>
  <text start="90.43" dur="6.54">CNN and they had this project Veritas</text>
  <text start="93.91" dur="5.52">journalist covertly filmed a candid</text>
  <text start="96.97" dur="5.61">discussion with CNN health producer Jon</text>
  <text start="99.43" dur="5.25">bono field where the very fake news and</text>
  <text start="102.58" dur="5.01">network employee admitted that the whole</text>
  <text start="104.68" dur="6.15">Russia story against Trump is nothing</text>
  <text start="107.59" dur="6.84">more than a ratings grab by CNN&amp;#39;s CEO</text>
  <text start="110.83" dur="5.82">Jeff Zucker and bono field also admitted</text>
  <text start="114.43" dur="4.91">that he hasn&amp;#39;t seen any evidence of</text>
  <text start="116.65" dur="5.28">trumps committing any type of crime of</text>
  <text start="119.34" dur="4.78">Russian collusion or anything like that</text>
  <text start="121.93" dur="4.17">whatsoever he said if we did have the</text>
  <text start="124.12" dur="3.96">evidence well we would know it and we</text>
  <text start="126.1" dur="4.19">would produce it and we can see that</text>
  <text start="128.08" dur="5.79">most of the networks I would say</text>
  <text start="130.29" dur="5.35">99.9999% of them they just grab on to</text>
  <text start="133.87" dur="4.86">these stories and they pass it from one</text>
  <text start="135.64" dur="6.72">corporate media outlet to the other and</text>
  <text start="138.73" dur="6.15">people since it shows up on USA Today</text>
  <text start="142.36" dur="5.879">ABC News NBC News the New York Times</text>
  <text start="144.88" dur="4.98">people assume that this is true then</text>
  <text start="148.239" dur="4.291">because it&amp;#39;s showing up on all these</text>
  <text start="149.86" dur="5.01">different media outlets but they need to</text>
  <text start="152.53" dur="4.86">remember that it&amp;#39;s these media outlets</text>
  <text start="154.87" dur="5.04">are owned by five different companies</text>
  <text start="157.39" dur="4.47">and they do this and this was all part</text>
  <text start="159.91" dur="4.92">of the plan from the beginning it was to</text>
  <text start="161.86" dur="5.07">allow this to happen so people believed</text>
  <text start="164.83" dur="5.28">the propaganda because when they see it</text>
  <text start="166.93" dur="5.58">appearing on many they say okay on one I</text>
  <text start="170.11" dur="4.8">kind of believe it on two I really do</text>
  <text start="172.51" dur="5.4">believe it on three well that&amp;#39;s it for</text>
  <text start="174.91" dur="7.62">me it has to be true because it&amp;#39;s on all</text>
  <text start="177.91" dur="6.81">of the major networks now CNN they tried</text>
  <text start="182.53" dur="6">it they trying to put out</text>
  <text start="184.72" dur="6">at Russian fake story they had the</text>
  <text start="188.53" dur="4.71">Pulitzer prize-winner Thomas Frank they</text>
  <text start="190.72" dur="5.34">created it they really had no proof</text>
  <text start="193.24" dur="4.2">whatsoever and it looks like everything</text>
  <text start="196.06" dur="3.27">has been falling apart because it looks</text>
  <text start="197.44" dur="3.39">like three CNN journalists including the</text>
  <text start="199.33" dur="5.76">Pulitzer Prize winner Thomas Frank</text>
  <text start="200.83" dur="7.29">well they resigned so who are they well</text>
  <text start="205.09" dur="5.34">Frank the reporter on the story Eric</text>
  <text start="208.12" dur="4.38">Lichtblau a recent CNN edition from New</text>
  <text start="210.43" dur="5.12">York Times who edited the piece and Lex</text>
  <text start="212.5" dur="6.27">Harris the executive editor of CNN</text>
  <text start="215.55" dur="6.4">investigates now there is an email going</text>
  <text start="218.77" dur="5.7">around CNN where CNN is imposing strict</text>
  <text start="221.95" dur="4.65">new publishing restrictions for online</text>
  <text start="224.47" dur="3.48">articles involving Russia and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="226.6" dur="3.66">saying that no one is allowed to publish</text>
  <text start="227.95" dur="5.94">any content involving Russia without</text>
  <text start="230.26" dur="7.08">trial prior approval and this applies to</text>
  <text start="233.89" dur="5.28">social media video editorial money</text>
  <text start="237.34" dur="3.9">stream there are no exceptions</text>
  <text start="239.17" dur="5.97">whatsoever because they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="241.24" dur="6.24">getting caught in fake news and this</text>
  <text start="245.14" dur="4.56">proves that the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="247.48" dur="4.46">dealing in fake news they&amp;#39;re not dealing</text>
  <text start="249.7" dur="5.13">in facts they&amp;#39;re not doing any type of</text>
  <text start="251.94" dur="5.019">investigative reporting and we can see</text>
  <text start="254.83" dur="4.74">that just by doing a little</text>
  <text start="256.959" dur="5.161">investigation by Project Veritas they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="259.57" dur="6.24">just proven everything that has been</text>
  <text start="262.12" dur="6.93">said about the corporate media now the</text>
  <text start="265.81" dur="7.14">Senate was trying to push a Russian</text>
  <text start="269.05" dur="6.36">sanctions bill and right now Trump well</text>
  <text start="272.95" dur="4.38">he&amp;#39;s going to disregard the recent</text>
  <text start="275.41" dur="3.87">Senate bill imposing new sanctions on</text>
  <text start="277.33" dur="4.08">Russia because it violated the</text>
  <text start="279.28" dur="4.56">constitutional requirement that revenue</text>
  <text start="281.41" dur="6">legislation originated in the House of</text>
  <text start="283.84" dur="5.49">Representatives so the bill violated the</text>
  <text start="287.41" dur="4.47">origination clause of the US</text>
  <text start="289.33" dur="5.13">Constitution which requires that any</text>
  <text start="291.88" dur="5.97">bill raising revenue originates in the</text>
  <text start="294.46" dur="5.7">house so right now they&amp;#39;re rejecting the</text>
  <text start="297.85" dur="5.31">Russian sanction bill right now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="300.16" dur="4.74">no bill there&amp;#39;s no new bill at this time</text>
  <text start="303.16" dur="3.39">which doesn&amp;#39;t mean there&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="304.9" dur="3.03">be one at this time they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="306.55" dur="4.619">prepared for this because normally</text>
  <text start="307.93" dur="7.34">they&amp;#39;d be like okay this is approved by</text>
  <text start="311.169" dur="7.201">Obama let&amp;#39;s move on now it was shot down</text>
  <text start="315.27" dur="6.16">so very interesting</text>
  <text start="318.37" dur="5.37">then it doesn&amp;#39;t know the rules they</text>
  <text start="321.43" dur="5.4">don&amp;#39;t understand what&amp;#39;s constitutional</text>
  <text start="323.74" dur="4.59">and what&amp;#39;s not constitutional well</text>
  <text start="326.83" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;ve been breaking the law they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="328.33" dur="3.839">been breaking the rules for so long they</text>
  <text start="330.16" dur="4.19">forgot how the whole thing works now</text>
  <text start="332.169" dur="5.731">Russia is out there and they oppose</text>
  <text start="334.35" dur="5.319">unilateral sanctions on North Korea they</text>
  <text start="337.9" dur="3.48">said we are against the broad</text>
  <text start="339.669" dur="4.441">interpretation of the UN say shion&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="341.38" dur="5.31">regime and moreover against the</text>
  <text start="344.11" dur="5.43">introduction of unilateral restrictions</text>
  <text start="346.69" dur="5.49">by individual states aimed in essence at</text>
  <text start="349.54" dur="3.9">the economic choke hold of North Korea</text>
  <text start="352.18" dur="4.14">this is coming from the Deputy Foreign</text>
  <text start="353.44" dur="5.49">Minister saying that this is not going</text>
  <text start="356.32" dur="4.05">to help the situation with North Korea</text>
  <text start="358.93" dur="3.6">it&amp;#39;s going to make the situation a lot</text>
  <text start="360.37" dur="6.359">worse and the people are going to pay</text>
  <text start="362.53" dur="6.75">the price and we see right now that the</text>
  <text start="366.729" dur="6.901">whole point of this is to put pressure</text>
  <text start="369.28" dur="8.22">on North Korea to make them full to make</text>
  <text start="373.63" dur="5.94">them pay for not doing what the deep</text>
  <text start="377.5" dur="5.789">state wants this is the whole point of</text>
  <text start="379.57" dur="7.08">sanctions and the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="383.289" dur="6.361">bank they&amp;#39;ve been using sanctions for</text>
  <text start="386.65" dur="5.4">many years this is why the dollar which</text>
  <text start="389.65" dur="5.579">is the reserve currency this gives them</text>
  <text start="392.05" dur="5.61">the power around the world to fund the</text>
  <text start="395.229" dur="5.671">covert operations it allows them to</text>
  <text start="397.66" dur="6.56">control countries and to choke countries</text>
  <text start="400.9" dur="6.63">when they don&amp;#39;t do what they want and</text>
  <text start="404.22" dur="5.77">Russia is saying this situation in North</text>
  <text start="407.53" dur="5.55">Korea is not going to be helped</text>
  <text start="409.99" dur="5.78">by placing sanctions on North Korea and</text>
  <text start="413.08" dur="5.82">we can see throughout time sanctions do</text>
  <text start="415.77" dur="5.8">absolutely nothing except hurt the</text>
  <text start="418.9" dur="5.91">people in the country it doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="421.57" dur="5.61">the governments in these countries fold</text>
  <text start="424.81" dur="5.97">actually countries have lasted a very</text>
  <text start="427.18" dur="5.91">long time without using the dollar they</text>
  <text start="430.78" dur="3.87">resort to other means to survive Iran</text>
  <text start="433.09" dur="3.15">has been doing it Cube has been doing it</text>
  <text start="434.65" dur="5.489">and many other countries</text>
  <text start="436.24" dur="6.51">now the U let the US has lumped China in</text>
  <text start="440.139" dur="5.701">manorath Korea Sudan Syria for human</text>

  <text start="448.3" dur="3.45">of international efforts to address</text>
  <text start="450.64" dur="4.32">human trafficking</text>
  <text start="451.75" dur="5.16">a form of modern-day slavery and in this</text>
  <text start="454.96" dur="4.2">new report the State Department</text>
  <text start="456.91" dur="4.77">downgraded China status moving it from</text>

  <text start="461.68" dur="4.83">could expose trying to do certain</text>
  <text start="463.33" dur="5.61">penalties China is joined by Iran North</text>
  <text start="466.51" dur="4.8">Korea Russia Sudan Syria and a number of</text>
  <text start="468.94" dur="4.79">other countries where human trafficking</text>
  <text start="471.31" dur="3.6">continues to be a serious problem and</text>
  <text start="473.73" dur="3.79">again</text>
  <text start="474.91" dur="5.01">the United States also has this problem</text>
  <text start="477.52" dur="5.46">but of course this is covered up and</text>
  <text start="479.92" dur="6.78">nobody wants to admit to it the UK has</text>
  <text start="482.98" dur="5.85">this problem and this is basically done</text>
  <text start="486.7" dur="3.9">with many different networks that are</text>
  <text start="488.83" dur="4.02">associated with all these countries</text>
  <text start="490.6" dur="3.72">where they are trafficking humans and</text>
  <text start="492.85" dur="4.56">this has been going on for a very long</text>
  <text start="494.32" dur="7.11">time and don&amp;#39;t be fooled the United</text>
  <text start="497.41" dur="7.92">States is part of this network and we</text>
  <text start="501.43" dur="6.36">can see that the Trump administration we</text>
  <text start="505.33" dur="4.38">can see Jeff Sessions they are trying to</text>
  <text start="507.79" dur="4.65">crack down on this now have we seen</text>
  <text start="509.71" dur="5.4">anything come out of this yet not as of</text>
  <text start="512.44" dur="5.279">yet but we&amp;#39;ll have to wait to see where</text>
  <text start="515.11" dur="5.13">they go with this now Trump is supposed</text>
  <text start="517.719" dur="4.531">to meet with Putin in Germany for a</text>
  <text start="520.24" dur="4.43">multinational summit next month but the</text>
  <text start="522.25" dur="4.589">idea of this well it&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="524.67" dur="4.12">exposing deep divisions within the</text>
  <text start="526.839" dur="3.991">administration on the best way to</text>
  <text start="528.79" dur="4.2">approach Moscow in the midst of an</text>
  <text start="530.83" dur="4.86">ongoing investigation into Russian</text>
  <text start="532.99" dur="4.68">meddling and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="535.69" dur="3.96">many administration officials believe</text>
  <text start="537.67" dur="5.97">the u.s. needs to maintain its distance</text>
  <text start="539.65" dur="6.96">from Russia at such a sensitive time but</text>
  <text start="543.64" dur="7.26">I think Trump should go ahead and meet</text>
  <text start="546.61" dur="7.56">with Putin to show the world and people</text>
  <text start="550.9" dur="5.91">in the United States that there is no</text>
  <text start="554.17" dur="5.07">Russian collusion there is no Russian</text>
  <text start="556.81" dur="5.58">meddling in the elections there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="559.24" dur="5.67">nothing here to fear and I believe that</text>
  <text start="562.39" dur="5.07">he should meet with Putin to show the</text>
  <text start="564.91" dur="4.38">world that we can get along now of</text>
  <text start="567.46" dur="4.26">course the deep State the corporate</text>
  <text start="569.29" dur="4.59">media they will play this up they will</text>
  <text start="571.72" dur="4.08">use this against Trump they&amp;#39;ll do</text>
  <text start="573.88" dur="6.42">whatever he paws whatever they possibly</text>
  <text start="575.8" dur="7.26">can to spin this in a way that makes it</text>
  <text start="580.3" dur="5.4">look like he&amp;#39;s doing something illegal</text>
  <text start="583.06" dur="6.42">when again he is not</text>
  <text start="585.7" dur="8.19">now sergey lavrov is out there and he is</text>
  <text start="589.48" dur="7.85">accusing the u.s. coalition of basically</text>
  <text start="593.89" dur="6.36">not hitting al nusra front now we know</text>
  <text start="597.33" dur="4.24">the al nusra front is part of the</text>
  <text start="600.25" dur="3.54">moderate rebels moderate rebels is</text>
  <text start="601.57" dur="4.65">basically a terrorist group made up of</text>
  <text start="603.79" dur="5.52">Al Qaeda al nusra front the Islamic</text>
  <text start="606.22" dur="5.34">state al sham and they just basically</text>
  <text start="609.31" dur="5.07">move people from place to place right</text>
  <text start="611.56" dur="4.62">now Al nusra well this is their</text>
  <text start="614.38" dur="4.89">terrorist group that they use these are</text>
  <text start="616.18" dur="5.73">paid mercenaries and they never bomb</text>
  <text start="619.27" dur="5.04">these individuals now the reason for</text>
  <text start="621.91" dur="4.77">this is because they use them this is</text>
  <text start="624.31" dur="4.59">the army of the deep state it has been</text>
  <text start="626.68" dur="4.34">for a very long time and the Russians</text>

  <text start="761.35" dur="5.4">see from what is happening around the</text>

  <text start="766.75" dur="6.12">to set up cyber bombs within Russia it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="770.26" dur="4.38">really not that difficult because most</text>

  <text start="825.94" dur="4.77">about this for a second there was first</text>
  <text start="828.4" dur="4.5">of all an anonymous source came out of</text>
  <text start="830.71" dur="5.46">the White House a person that was very</text>
  <text start="832.9" dur="5.4">close to the administration close ties</text>
  <text start="836.17" dur="4.17">to the one and this information was</text>
  <text start="838.3" dur="5.31">leaked and the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="840.34" dur="4.95">running with this and right now the</text>

  <text start="845.29" dur="4.2">saying well if this is true well Assad</text>
  <text start="848.11" dur="4.65">is going to have to pay the price for</text>
  <text start="849.49" dur="5.25">this and nikki Haley was out there</text>
  <text start="852.76" dur="3.75">and she was jumping on the bandwagon</text>
  <text start="854.74" dur="3.15">just like all these individuals do</text>
  <text start="856.51" dur="4.32">because they&amp;#39;re part of the deep state</text>
  <text start="857.89" dur="4.95">saying that any further attacks done to</text>
  <text start="860.83" dur="4.32">the people of Syria will be blamed on</text>
  <text start="862.84" dur="5.01">Assad not the Syrian government but</text>
  <text start="865.15" dur="5.43">specifically Assad but also on Russia</text>
  <text start="867.85" dur="5.13">Iran who support him killing his own</text>
  <text start="870.58" dur="4.83">people all right let&amp;#39;s break this down</text>
  <text start="872.98" dur="5.76">for a second first of all why would</text>
  <text start="875.41" dur="5.82">Assad at this point start killing his</text>
  <text start="878.74" dur="4.56">own people does it make any sense let me</text>
  <text start="881.23" dur="6.09">see I&amp;#39;m liberating clearing villages</text>
  <text start="883.3" dur="7.26">people are applauding him Russia is in</text>
  <text start="887.32" dur="5.28">there Iran is in there at the request of</text>
  <text start="890.56" dur="4.89">the Syrian government they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="892.6" dur="5.55">huge strides in the fight against</text>

  <text start="898.15" dur="4.95">going to turn around and gas his own</text>
  <text start="900.97" dur="5.25">people it doesn&amp;#39;t even make sense and</text>
  <text start="903.1" dur="5.88">again we know that all these chemical</text>
  <text start="906.22" dur="5.55">attacks they didn&amp;#39;t come from Assad they</text>
  <text start="908.98" dur="6.12">came from the terrorist groups actually</text>
  <text start="911.77" dur="5.22">the last one was as we know completely</text>
  <text start="915.1" dur="4.53">fake phony and false there was an MIT</text>
  <text start="916.99" dur="5.88">professor there was this new article by</text>
  <text start="919.63" dur="6">Seymour Hersh which talks about how this</text>
  <text start="922.87" dur="6.54">was completely fake these are false</text>
  <text start="925.63" dur="7.17">Flags hoaxes so the deep state can move</text>
  <text start="929.41" dur="4.74">in and do something else in the country</text>
  <text start="932.8" dur="2.87">and this is what they&amp;#39;ve been using for</text>
  <text start="934.15" dur="5.1">a very long time now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="935.67" dur="6.34">surprising about this one is that there</text>
  <text start="939.25" dur="6.33">was a leak letting everyone know that</text>
  <text start="942.01" dur="6.63">they&amp;#39;re planning this now normally false</text>
  <text start="945.58" dur="6.11">Flags they don&amp;#39;t leak this all of a</text>
  <text start="948.64" dur="6.84">sudden it happens they might say hey if</text>
  <text start="951.69" dur="6.19">they someone crosses a red line will</text>
  <text start="955.48" dur="2.88">react now Trump doesn&amp;#39;t speak in red</text>
  <text start="957.88" dur="3.15">line</text>
  <text start="958.36" dur="6.98">he doesn&amp;#39;t speak in absolutes but this</text>
  <text start="961.03" dur="9.53">was leaked to the press on purpose now</text>
  <text start="965.34" dur="9.67">was this a message to Russia to Syria</text>
  <text start="970.56" dur="6.93">saying listen we have intelligence we</text>
  <text start="975.01" dur="7.11">know they&amp;#39;re planning a false flag and</text>
  <text start="977.49" dur="5.68">they leaked it out to warn them think</text>
  <text start="982.12" dur="3.81">about this for a second</text>
  <text start="983.17" dur="6.12">because if they&amp;#39;re going to create</text>
  <text start="985.93" dur="6.08">this false flag why would they let it</text>
  <text start="989.29" dur="5.76">out ahead of time it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="992.01" dur="4.9">because already Russia is saying no this</text>
  <text start="995.05" dur="4.17">is not happening Syria saying no this is</text>
  <text start="996.91" dur="4.739">not happening we&amp;#39;re not preparing</text>
  <text start="999.22" dur="3.51">anything look around you can see it</text>
  <text start="1001.649" dur="4.051">makes no sense</text>
  <text start="1002.73" dur="6.63">think about what Putin did right after</text>
  <text start="1005.7" dur="5.25">the chemical attack in Syria where</text>
  <text start="1009.36" dur="3.21">everyone was saying was complete false</text>
  <text start="1010.95" dur="5.49">flag it never really happened</text>
  <text start="1012.57" dur="7.35">Putin back at that time said they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1016.44" dur="4.74">planning on another chemical attack now</text>
  <text start="1019.92" dur="5.009">he did this on purpose</text>
  <text start="1021.18" dur="6.33">to say that the deep state is planning</text>
  <text start="1024.929" dur="5.191">to do something here we have this leak</text>
  <text start="1027.51" dur="5.569">saying that the deep state is planning</text>
  <text start="1030.12" dur="6">to do something now we need to remember</text>
  <text start="1033.079" dur="6.13">that during the summer months especially</text>
  <text start="1036.12" dur="6.63">leading into August this is when the</text>
  <text start="1039.209" dur="6.181">elite like to play and if we look at the</text>
  <text start="1042.75" dur="5.37">patterns going back in time we can see</text>
  <text start="1045.39" dur="5.61">the sarin gas attack of 2013 guess when</text>
  <text start="1048.12" dur="4.68">it happened in August when we go back in</text>
  <text start="1051" dur="5.63">time and we look at the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1052.8" dur="7.379">when did they come out from nowhere ah</text>
  <text start="1056.63" dur="7.39">the end of July into August why August</text>
  <text start="1060.179" dur="6.591">this is when Congress goes on break they</text>
  <text start="1064.02" dur="6.06">don&amp;#39;t come back until after Labor Day</text>
  <text start="1066.77" dur="5.86">the United States started bombing inside</text>
  <text start="1070.08" dur="5.52">of Syria Oh around the August timeframe</text>
  <text start="1072.63" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s always around this timeframe and it</text>
  <text start="1075.6" dur="5.13">looks like they might have been</text>
  <text start="1077.52" dur="5.85">preparing to do this again during this</text>
  <text start="1080.73" dur="4.17">period of time preparing everything and</text>
  <text start="1083.37" dur="3.12">they use the white helmets they get</text>
  <text start="1084.9" dur="3.54">everything set up they make sure</text>
  <text start="1086.49" dur="7.14">everything is done for the false flag</text>
  <text start="1088.44" dur="8.55">and this might be a warning to Syria</text>
  <text start="1093.63" dur="4.98">Russia Iran letting them know letting</text>
  <text start="1096.99" dur="5.16">this leak out because they found the</text>
  <text start="1098.61" dur="5.819">intelligence to get prepared and get</text>
  <text start="1102.15" dur="6.24">ready to show that this really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1104.429" dur="6.211">happen now the UK is out there British</text>
  <text start="1108.39" dur="4.56">defense secretary says the UK will</text>
  <text start="1110.64" dur="4.47">support the u.s. if it retaliates</text>
  <text start="1112.95" dur="4.859">against Syria for any use of chemical</text>
  <text start="1115.11" dur="4.5">weapons it&amp;#39;s funny how when the</text>
  <text start="1117.809" dur="4.111">terrorist groups use the chemical web</text>
  <text start="1119.61" dur="5.79">all these countries just completely say</text>
  <text start="1121.92" dur="6.42">silent again we know why because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1125.4" dur="6.12">their paid mercenary army and we see</text>
  <text start="1128.34" dur="4.95">that the russian senator the first</text>

  <text start="1134.94" dur="6.42">security France clincham bitch he&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="1138.93" dur="6.78">there saying the reason for this is</text>
  <text start="1141.36" dur="7.41">because the deep state they&amp;#39;re planning</text>
  <text start="1145.71" dur="5.25">a new US attack and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1148.77" dur="4.56">pass it off as a chemical attack yes</text>
  <text start="1150.96" dur="4.29">this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="1153.33" dur="5.82">this is why they&amp;#39;ve been building up in</text>
  <text start="1155.25" dur="5.52">military bases in the Kurd region this</text>
  <text start="1159.15" dur="4.32">is why they bring in the Heim our</text>
  <text start="1160.77" dur="4.8">missile system this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1163.47" dur="3.99">bringing troops in there because what</text>
  <text start="1165.57" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re getting ready to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1167.46" dur="5.93">getting ready to split off Syria and</text>
  <text start="1169.41" dur="8.58">they need some type of an event plus</text>
  <text start="1173.39" dur="7.57">Russia Syria Iran they are wiping out</text>
  <text start="1177.99" dur="5.25">the terrorist groups there runs there</text>
  <text start="1180.96" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re racing against time right now</text>
  <text start="1183.24" dur="7.71">now Russia the Russian Ministry of</text>
  <text start="1186.87" dur="6.09">Defense announced on June 21st that</text>
  <text start="1190.95" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re going to establish a new heavy</text>

  <text start="1195.18" dur="5.16">armored and mechanized divisions</text>
  <text start="1197.3" dur="5.29">directly to battle locations over</text>

  <text start="1212.64" dur="5.52">transports which require no preparation</text>
  <text start="1215.46" dur="6.27">to become operational now they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1218.16" dur="6.69">this at the same exact time so when we</text>
  <text start="1221.73" dur="6.51">look at this we can see that this entire</text>
  <text start="1224.85" dur="6.48">warning well it came out at the same</text>
  <text start="1228.24" dur="5.94">exact time that Seymour Hersh says the</text>
  <text start="1231.33" dur="7.08">chemical attack never really happened</text>
  <text start="1234.18" dur="6.54">now again we know that these are false</text>
  <text start="1238.41" dur="5.19">flags we know the deep state uses them</text>
  <text start="1240.72" dur="5.4">the thing is what is Trump going to do</text>
  <text start="1243.6" dur="5.28">yes I know he was out there saying that</text>
  <text start="1246.12" dur="4.89">Assad is gonna say this</text>
  <text start="1248.88" dur="4.26">we know that nikki Haley was out there</text>
  <text start="1251.01" dur="3.84">Sean Spicer was out there</text>
  <text start="1253.14" dur="4.14">other individuals were out there saying</text>
  <text start="1254.85" dur="4.949">that yes the Syrian government Assad</text>
  <text start="1257.28" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re going to pay for this well he</text>
  <text start="1259.799" dur="4.951">said this about Kim jong-un and we never</text>
  <text start="1262.17" dur="5.55">attacked we never did anything there now</text>
  <text start="1264.75" dur="6.12">to me this looks like this is a complete</text>
  <text start="1267.72" dur="4.74">setup because there&amp;#39;s no way the deep</text>
  <text start="1270.87" dur="5.55">state is going to leak this information</text>
  <text start="1272.46" dur="6.96">and let everyone know what the false</text>
  <text start="1276.42" dur="6.69">flag is going to be this looks like this</text>
  <text start="1279.42" dur="7.8">was done on purpose to stop the false</text>
  <text start="1283.11" dur="7.35">flag and we see right now that the</text>
  <text start="1287.22" dur="5.1">Pentagon well it looks like they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1290.46" dur="4.68">really informed it looks like this was</text>
  <text start="1292.32" dur="4.95">kept kind of like a secret where they</text>
  <text start="1295.14" dur="3.72">got the intelligence information and</text>
  <text start="1297.27" dur="3.96">they didn&amp;#39;t want to let too many</text>
  <text start="1298.86" dur="4.8">agencies know about what was real what</text>
  <text start="1301.23" dur="5.99">they knew about it until they leaked the</text>
  <text start="1303.66" dur="5.73">information so we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="1307.22" dur="4.209">we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch this very</text>
  <text start="1309.39" dur="3.72">carefully because it&amp;#39;s already out in</text>
  <text start="1311.429" dur="4.441">the open that there&amp;#39;s a false flag</text>
  <text start="1313.11" dur="5.67">coming Russia knows about it Syria knows</text>
  <text start="1315.87" dur="5.46">about it Syria&amp;#39;s are we denying that</text>
  <text start="1318.78" dur="5.58">this is even happening so once again</text>
  <text start="1321.33" dur="5.82">this could have completely stopped this</text>
  <text start="1324.36" dur="4.17">false flag now does this mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1327.15" dur="3.45">not going to come up with something else</text>
  <text start="1328.53" dur="3.84">no it means they&amp;#39;re going to try once</text>
  <text start="1330.6" dur="3.78">again they might even go through with</text>
  <text start="1332.37" dur="4.049">the false flag to see if it gets any</text>
  <text start="1334.38" dur="4.71">type of traction but they&amp;#39;ve been trying</text>
  <text start="1336.419" dur="5.671">to use this type of story for a very</text>
  <text start="1339.09" dur="6.06">long time and they can&amp;#39;t get anything</text>
  <text start="1342.09" dur="5.85">out of it I mean they show pictures and</text>
  <text start="1345.15" dur="5.519">everyone completely debunks everything</text>
  <text start="1347.94" dur="4.44">they throw out there because many people</text>
  <text start="1350.669" dur="5.25">know that this is completely fake phony</text>
  <text start="1352.38" dur="5.52">and false and they keep trying the same</text>
  <text start="1355.919" dur="4.831">thing over and over and over because you</text>
  <text start="1357.9" dur="4.56">know why they have nothing else and now</text>
  <text start="1360.75" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re getting caught and they&amp;#39;re</text>
