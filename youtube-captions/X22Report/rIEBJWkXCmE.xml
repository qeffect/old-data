  <text start="106.44" dur="3.84">corporate media all part of the system</text>
  <text start="108.72" dur="5.34">where they need to continually</text>
  <text start="110.28" dur="5.49">manipulate what people are seeing and we</text>
  <text start="114.06" dur="4.919">know at this point is because they want</text>
  <text start="115.77" dur="6.5">people thinking in a certain way they</text>
  <text start="118.979" dur="6.541">don&amp;#39;t want them to hear certain stories</text>
  <text start="122.27" dur="5.879">they don&amp;#39;t want to hear stories around</text>
  <text start="125.52" dur="6.42">the world only what the US government</text>
  <text start="128.149" dur="6.221">wants you to hear and if there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="131.94" dur="4.019">election going on they want certain</text>
  <text start="134.37" dur="3.69">information out there and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="135.959" dur="4.051">want other information to be presented</text>
  <text start="138.06" dur="4.83">to anyone and this is how they play the</text>
  <text start="140.01" dur="4.619">game ad because they feel if they own it</text>
  <text start="142.89" dur="3.69">it it&amp;#39;s no big deal it&amp;#39;s not like</text>
  <text start="144.629" dur="4.291">they&amp;#39;re hiding it not like they lie they</text>
  <text start="146.58" dur="6.019">just left it out and that&amp;#39;s not really</text>
  <text start="148.92" dur="10.59">reporting all news that&amp;#39;s selecting news</text>
  <text start="152.599" dur="11.861">very big difference so we know the</text>
  <text start="159.51" dur="7.8">government loves to spy on the people</text>
  <text start="164.46" dur="6">and they do it through many different</text>
  <text start="167.31" dur="7.92">ways and we know they are trying to get</text>
  <text start="170.46" dur="6.87">encryption removed but what I find very</text>
  <text start="175.23" dur="6.63">interesting and this reminds me of the</text>
  <text start="177.33" dur="7.26">movie V for Vendetta where they had that</text>
  <text start="181.86" dur="6">van driving around and if you haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="184.59" dur="5.22">seen it I would go just watch the movie</text>
  <text start="187.86" dur="3.78">but if you have seen it you know that</text>
  <text start="189.81" dur="2.97">van that was driving around where</text>
  <text start="191.64" dur="3.15">they&amp;#39;re intercepting all the</text>
  <text start="192.78" dur="2.94">communication it was all coming into one</text>
  <text start="194.79" dur="2.58">place and they were listening to the</text>
  <text start="195.72" dur="4.14">communication you&amp;#39;re just driving around</text>
  <text start="197.37" dur="4.2">town making sure that nobody was saying</text>
  <text start="199.86" dur="3.3">something about the government or</text>
  <text start="201.57" dur="3.93">anything like that if there was they</text>
  <text start="203.16" dur="8.07">send the people in there well in</text>
  <text start="205.5" dur="10.08">Philadelphia there was an SUV in that</text>
  <text start="211.23" dur="7.44">area and it had the Google Maps sign on</text>
  <text start="215.58" dur="5.49">it and this is a truck that you would</text>
  <text start="218.67" dur="4.95">see where Google drives around and they</text>
  <text start="221.07" dur="5.28">map the streets and there&amp;#39;s cameras on</text>
  <text start="223.62" dur="4.05">top so people passing by would say oh ok</text>
  <text start="226.35" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s some google map truck it just</text>
  <text start="227.67" dur="5.84">parked here not a big deal but the</text>
  <text start="230.25" dur="6.21">problem is is that on top of the truck</text>
  <text start="233.51" dur="7.3">they were two high-powered license plate</text>
  <text start="236.46" dur="6.54">reader cameras and they were recording</text>
  <text start="240.81" dur="6.06">all the license plates all over the</text>
  <text start="243" dur="7.44">place and when you look at the place</text>
  <text start="246.87" dur="5.1">card on the dashboard it&amp;#39;s registered</text>
  <text start="250.44" dur="5.07">with the philadelphia office of fleet</text>
  <text start="251.97" dur="6.45">management and the Philadelphia Police</text>
  <text start="255.51" dur="5.13">Department they have admitted it is</text>
  <text start="258.42" dur="5.34">their truck and now they&amp;#39;re launching an</text>
  <text start="260.64" dur="6.18">inquiry to why this was disguised as a</text>
  <text start="263.76" dur="4.83">Google vehicle now I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="266.82" dur="3.87">surprised if there&amp;#39;s more of these type</text>
  <text start="268.59" dur="4.53">of vehicles out there where you think</text>
  <text start="270.69" dur="6.12">it&amp;#39;s a delivery van you think it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="273.12" dur="6.21">google street map truck mapping the</text>
  <text start="276.81" dur="4.83">streets because we can see the US</text>
  <text start="279.33" dur="4.11">government central bankers the local law</text>
  <text start="281.64" dur="4.65">enforcement they&amp;#39;re all under the same</text>
  <text start="283.44" dur="7.02">umbrella their instructions are to spy</text>
  <text start="286.29" dur="5.85">on the people and what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="290.46" dur="4.29">doing is they&amp;#39;ve been photographing</text>
  <text start="292.14" dur="6.09">thousands of license plates and they</text>
  <text start="294.75" dur="5.97">were doing this throughout the day</text>
  <text start="298.23" dur="4.08">and they were warrantless Lee tracking</text>
  <text start="300.72" dur="4.65">and storing the average person&amp;#39;s travel</text>
  <text start="302.31" dur="4.47">habits and once they have this they know</text>
  <text start="305.37" dur="4.11">you know where you are where you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="306.78" dur="4.56">going where you&amp;#39;ve been it&amp;#39;s not that</text>
  <text start="309.48" dur="6.06">they&amp;#39;re getting the license plate</text>
  <text start="311.34" dur="6.93">they&amp;#39;re taking the license plate putting</text>
  <text start="315.54" dur="6.18">it to a location and every time it pops</text>
  <text start="318.27" dur="6.21">up they can figure out where you go and</text>
  <text start="321.72" dur="4.8">where you are at any point in the day so</text>
  <text start="324.48" dur="3.66">if they had this truck here at the</text>
  <text start="326.52" dur="3.48">convention center that had one at a</text>
  <text start="328.14" dur="4.23">supermarket they had one over here</text>
  <text start="330" dur="4.65">whenever they start picking you up they</text>
  <text start="332.37" dur="5.54">know where you are because it starts to</text>
  <text start="334.65" dur="7.77">correlate into one place and they can</text>
  <text start="337.91" dur="5.86">use this to track individuals and of</text>
  <text start="342.42" dur="6.03">course this is a violation of your</text>
  <text start="343.77" dur="8.73">rights now Alton Venezuela we see the</text>
  <text start="348.45" dur="6.93">coup is pushing forward here and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="352.5" dur="6.36">very interesting is the person the next</text>

  <text start="358.86" dur="5.58">be Michelle temer and this man is almost</text>
  <text start="362.22" dur="5.37">as unpopular as the president he is</text>
  <text start="364.44" dur="5.18">replacing now he hasn&amp;#39;t won any</text>
  <text start="367.59" dur="5.52">elections on his own in a decade and</text>
  <text start="369.62" dur="8.05">he&amp;#39;s usually in the background he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="373.11" dur="7.89">wheeler-dealer and he&amp;#39;s looking to</text>
  <text start="377.67" dur="5.52">replace his boss now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="381" dur="11.16">interesting about all of this as it</text>
  <text start="383.19" dur="14.46">turns out this person temer is part of</text>
  <text start="392.16" dur="8.58">the US State Department&amp;#39;s coup d&amp;#39;etat to</text>
  <text start="397.65" dur="4.89">put in a puppet government because</text>
  <text start="400.74" dur="4.77">earlier today WikiLeaks released</text>
  <text start="402.54" dur="6">evidence via declassified cable that</text>
  <text start="405.51" dur="5.31">Brazil&amp;#39;s new interim president was an</text>
  <text start="408.54" dur="6.99">embassy informant for the US</text>
  <text start="410.82" dur="6.21">intelligence and military he</text>
  <text start="415.53" dur="3.78">communicated with the US Embassy in</text>
  <text start="417.03" dur="5.82">Brazil and such content would be</text>
  <text start="419.31" dur="8.06">classified as sensitive and for official</text>
  <text start="422.85" dur="8.23">use only what do you think he was doing</text>
  <text start="427.37" dur="7.23">he was helping the United States</text>
  <text start="431.08" dur="5.41">form this coup d&amp;#39;etat in Brazil they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="434.6" dur="4.53">doing it in Venezuela they want it in</text>
  <text start="436.49" dur="6.57">Argentina they&amp;#39;ve been trying in Syria</text>
  <text start="439.13" dur="5.25">they did it in Ukraine it&amp;#39;s all part of</text>
  <text start="443.06" dur="5.34">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="444.38" dur="6.36">bankers master plan replace governments</text>
  <text start="448.4" dur="6.3">that don&amp;#39;t cooperate with us with a</text>
  <text start="450.74" dur="6.78">puppet government install a central bank</text>
  <text start="454.7" dur="5.82">a private western central bank take</text>
  <text start="457.52" dur="6.24">their oil and have them sell it using</text>
  <text start="460.52" dur="5.49">the dollar now this most likely will</text>
  <text start="463.76" dur="4.409">blow up in their face because we see all</text>
  <text start="466.01" dur="5.61">the other countries they are a complete</text>
  <text start="468.169" dur="6.261">disaster and we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="471.62" dur="6.21">watch this situation very very carefully</text>
  <text start="474.43" dur="5.92">now out in Tunisia we see that the</text>
  <text start="477.83" dur="5.7">United States they&amp;#39;re going to supply</text>
  <text start="480.35" dur="5.25">them with military hardware and this is</text>
  <text start="483.53" dur="4.29">part of their 20 million dollar</text>
  <text start="485.6" dur="4.35">allocation to enhance their military</text>
  <text start="487.82" dur="3.72">capabilities of the country and what</text>
  <text start="489.95" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re going to give them because of</text>
  <text start="491.54" dur="4.53">the Islamic state they&amp;#39;re going to give</text>
  <text start="493.58" dur="5.01">them 12 light surveillance aircraft and</text>
  <text start="496.07" dur="4.89">48 chips as well as communications</text>
  <text start="498.59" dur="4.32">technologies to track extremely</text>
  <text start="500.96" dur="6.78">extremists attempting to infiltrate the</text>
  <text start="502.91" dur="7.319">country because we realize that in Libya</text>
  <text start="507.74" dur="6.09">and Tunisia borders right against Libya</text>
  <text start="510.229" dur="6.211">there&amp;#39;s going to be war now we realize</text>
  <text start="513.83" dur="5.399">at this point that Russia is trying to</text>
  <text start="516.44" dur="6.24">step in there talking to Italy Lavrov is</text>
  <text start="519.229" dur="5.821">talking to a counterpart in Italy trying</text>
  <text start="522.68" dur="5.37">to defuse the situation there because</text>
  <text start="525.05" dur="4.65">once the unity government is in place we</text>
  <text start="528.05" dur="3.78">know that there are troops standing by</text>
  <text start="529.7" dur="4.41">we know that they&amp;#39;ve been planning this</text>
  <text start="531.83" dur="6.24">and they&amp;#39;re just waiting for the green</text>
  <text start="534.11" dur="7.88">light for the go-ahead now the u.s. at</text>
  <text start="538.07" dur="8.31">this point they are looking to loosen</text>
  <text start="541.99" dur="5.8">the arms embargo now before the unity</text>
  <text start="546.38" dur="3.36">government was there they said</text>
  <text start="547.79" dur="3.36">absolutely not we&amp;#39;re not going to loosen</text>
  <text start="549.74" dur="3.539">the arms embargo now the unity</text>
  <text start="551.15" dur="5.629">government is in Libya you&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="553.279" dur="7.741">okay you know something maybe it&amp;#39;s time</text>
  <text start="556.779" dur="9.071">so if the Libyan government prepares a</text>
  <text start="561.02" dur="8.189">detailed and coherent list of things</text>
  <text start="565.85" dur="6.81">that they want they&amp;#39;re going to look at</text>
  <text start="569.209" dur="7.921">this and they&amp;#39;ll have the UN go ahead</text>
  <text start="572.66" dur="7.02">and lift the arms embargo because what</text>
  <text start="577.13" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re getting ready for is a major</text>
  <text start="579.68" dur="3.779">offensive in this country this is what</text>
  <text start="581.63" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re preparing for they want them</text>
  <text start="583.459" dur="4.891">armed and ready and once they get the</text>
  <text start="585.98" dur="4.8">green light all hell&amp;#39;s going to break</text>
  <text start="588.35" dur="4.92">loose in this area it&amp;#39;s going to spread</text>
  <text start="590.78" dur="4.77">to other countries and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="593.27" dur="3.39">see the Middle East light up the United</text>

  <text start="598.25" dur="5.3">preparing for this with many other</text>
  <text start="600.829" dur="6.451">countries and we&amp;#39;re going to see this</text>
  <text start="603.55" dur="7.24">really kick off most likely this summer</text>
  <text start="607.28" dur="6.24">now out in Libya we realize that there</text>
  <text start="610.79" dur="5.1">are many countries that have special op</text>
  <text start="613.52" dur="3.54">teams inside of Libya they&amp;#39;ve been there</text>
  <text start="615.89" dur="3.36">for quite a while they&amp;#39;re preparing</text>

  <text start="623.66" dur="6.06">their drones over we know forces are</text>
  <text start="625.97" dur="6.84">been built up in this area and what</text>
  <text start="629.72" dur="8.01">we&amp;#39;re starting to find out is that the</text>
  <text start="632.81" dur="8.58">US have two military outposts in libya</text>
  <text start="637.73" dur="7.8">since late 2015 each containing fewer</text>

  <text start="645.53" dur="4.35">the other one is in Benghazi but Misrata</text>
  <text start="647.54" dur="6.98">is a line with the Tripoli government</text>
  <text start="649.88" dur="10.22">who&amp;#39;s the real government of Libya and</text>
  <text start="654.52" dur="8.79">these are in position for what is coming</text>

  <text start="663.31" dur="7.42">because of human rights violations</text>
  <text start="667.01" dur="5.37">against the Kurds and the UN is ready to</text>
  <text start="670.73" dur="3.81">send a mission to Turkey to investigate</text>

  <text start="686.839" dur="3.151">these allegations now of course is</text>
  <text start="688.819" dur="3.63">turkey I&amp;#39;m just going to let them in</text>
  <text start="689.99" dur="4.41">most likely not but we come on we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="692.449" dur="5.191">have to wait and see and we&amp;#39;ll see what</text>

  <text start="978.42" dur="4.5">cyber hacks and things like that they</text>
  <text start="980.73" dur="5.07">have access to them out malware well</text>
  <text start="982.92" dur="4.41">they blamed it on Russia and they wanted</text>
  <text start="985.8" dur="3.18">to test it out to see if they can bring</text>
  <text start="987.33" dur="3.75">down the power infrastructure in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="988.98" dur="4.169">and they actually did it I believe back</text>
  <text start="991.08" dur="5.449">in 2003 when we had the power outage in</text>
  <text start="993.149" dur="6.451">the east coast this was also a test</text>
  <text start="996.529" dur="5.591">because they do these things very far in</text>

  <text start="1002.12" dur="5.07">it works how it&amp;#39;s been done and we can</text>
  <text start="1005.779" dur="4.651">see right now that they&amp;#39;re using the</text>
  <text start="1007.19" dur="4.589">propaganda and the idea that the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="1010.43" dur="4.86">going to be cyber attack then this is</text>
  <text start="1011.779" dur="5.881">the perfect propaganda because the US</text>
  <text start="1015.29" dur="5.91">government central bankers they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1017.66" dur="8.549">have to prove anything all they have to</text>
  <text start="1021.2" dur="7.77">do is shut things down or plant a piece</text>
  <text start="1026.209" dur="6.091">of malware that they control and say it</text>
  <text start="1028.97" dur="6.27">was somebody else and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="1032.3" dur="5.159">what they&amp;#39;ve been planning because all</text>
  <text start="1035.24" dur="4.77">this time right now they&amp;#39;ve been telling</text>
  <text start="1037.459" dur="6.24">us that Russia has malware in the power</text>
  <text start="1040.01" dur="6.799">infrastructure China has been hacking in</text>
  <text start="1043.699" dur="6.781">North Korea now has been hacking in</text>

  <text start="1053.45" dur="6.54">just keeping this alive long enough so</text>
  <text start="1055.809" dur="6.461">when this entire system comes down they</text>
  <text start="1059.99" dur="6">have people to blame now they&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="1062.27" dur="7.47">this a step further and everyone knows</text>
  <text start="1065.99" dur="5.49">the name Osama bin Laden and what</text>
  <text start="1069.74" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1071.48" dur="5.19">trying to bring back the bin Laden name</text>
  <text start="1073.55" dur="7.83">of course they waive those pages on us</text>

  <text start="1087.19" dur="9.91">being put up as the poster child of</text>
  <text start="1091.45" dur="10.78">maybe attacking and calling to arms</text>
  <text start="1097.1" dur="8.16">another terrorist act and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1102.23" dur="7.77">trying to say is that he&amp;#39;s being groomed</text>
  <text start="1105.26" dur="6.33">to take over al-qaeda and it looks like</text>
  <text start="1110" dur="4.169">they&amp;#39;re putting all the pieces together</text>
  <text start="1111.59" dur="6.77">here to create this picture to convince</text>
  <text start="1114.169" dur="7.89">the u.s. the American people the</text>
  <text start="1118.36" dur="6.01">European people the Canadian people the</text>

  <text start="1132.799" dur="6.301">of the terrorists that brought down the</text>
  <text start="1137.299" dur="3.841">towers of 911 now we know what this is</text>
  <text start="1139.1" dur="6">all fake but this is what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1141.14" dur="8.519">to use to convince everyone that this</text>
  <text start="1145.1" dur="8.459">next attack is going to be 10 times as</text>
  <text start="1149.659" dur="5.791">worse as 911 now we know 911 was a</text>
  <text start="1153.559" dur="4.201">complete inside job we know other</text>
  <text start="1155.45" dur="4.44">foreign governments did help with</text>
  <text start="1157.76" dur="5.25">bringing down the towers we know the</text>
  <text start="1159.89" dur="6.779">towers were insured against cyber</text>
  <text start="1163.01" dur="6.39">against terrorist attacks months before</text>
  <text start="1166.669" dur="4.591">the attack actually occurred we know</text>
  <text start="1169.4" dur="3.509">there was a lot of asbestos in the</text>
  <text start="1171.26" dur="3.12">building it had to be removed and was</text>
  <text start="1172.909" dur="3.75">going to cause billions and billions of</text>
  <text start="1174.38" dur="5.58">dollars it&amp;#39;d be easier to just to</text>
  <text start="1176.659" dur="5.491">demolish the buildings so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1179.96" dur="4.56">seeing at this point is they are</text>
  <text start="1182.15" dur="4.62">preparing getting ready for this next</text>
  <text start="1184.52" dur="4.5">event and we do have a perfect storm</text>
  <text start="1186.77" dur="4.98">coming up and I mentioned this before I</text>
  <text start="1189.02" dur="5.19">mean really think about it we have the</text>
  <text start="1191.75" dur="4.559">elections coming up this year the</text>
  <text start="1194.21" dur="4.589">economy is continually deteriorating and</text>
  <text start="1196.309" dur="6.48">the government numbers make no sense</text>
  <text start="1198.799" dur="8.191">whatsoever they don&amp;#39;t jive with what the</text>
  <text start="1202.789" dur="8.101">actual industry is reporting they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1206.99" dur="7.4">completely separate and apart we see</text>
  <text start="1210.89" dur="7.71">their provoking war across the globe</text>
  <text start="1214.39" dur="8.62">Russia is in Syria the u.s. is backed</text>
  <text start="1218.6" dur="7.35">against the wall we know the status quo</text>
  <text start="1223.01" dur="7.14">they don&amp;#39;t want Trump in office they</text>
  <text start="1225.95" dur="8.1">despise him they&amp;#39;d rather have Clinton</text>
  <text start="1230.15" dur="6.15">I don&amp;#39;t even think they want Sanders so</text>
  <text start="1234.05" dur="4.68">they can do one or two things they can</text>
  <text start="1236.3" dur="4.44">assassinate him but I think that&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="1238.73" dur="4.26">obvious at this point I think people</text>
  <text start="1240.74" dur="3.95">will realize well wait a minute he was</text>
  <text start="1242.99" dur="4.77">assassinated before he was president</text>
  <text start="1244.69" dur="5.04">that&amp;#39;s kind of strange he became</text>
  <text start="1247.76" dur="5.99">president and then he was assassinated</text>
  <text start="1249.73" dur="9.4">okay this is way too obvious but if</text>
  <text start="1253.75" dur="9.12">there is some type of economic disaster</text>
  <text start="1259.13" dur="6.27">if there is some type of physical attack</text>
  <text start="1262.87" dur="4.51">the president at this point and go to</text>
  <text start="1265.4" dur="5.55">Congress and say we need to go to state</text>
  <text start="1267.38" dur="7.11">of emergency and we need to hold off</text>
  <text start="1270.95" dur="6.87">elections temporarily now if he does</text>
  <text start="1274.49" dur="6.99">this in July it won&amp;#39;t work if he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1277.82" dur="6.09">in September maybe most likely oh he</text>
  <text start="1281.48" dur="5.19">will wait until October because we know</text>
  <text start="1283.91" dur="7.05">in August they&amp;#39;re getting ready to go</text>
  <text start="1286.67" dur="8.51">into Syria and once this happens all</text>
  <text start="1290.96" dur="8.34">bets are off war is going to begin and</text>
  <text start="1295.18" dur="6.22">going forward he can say state of</text>
  <text start="1299.3" dur="3.93">emergency because of war he can say</text>
  <text start="1301.4" dur="4.8">because of physical attack he can say</text>
  <text start="1303.23" dur="4.8">because of a cyber attack he can say the</text>
  <text start="1306.2" dur="4.02">economy just crashed because of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1308.03" dur="5.94">happening out in the Middle East he can</text>
  <text start="1310.22" dur="8.13">use anything at this point we have this</text>
  <text start="1313.97" dur="7.47">perfect storm coming up and we need to</text>
