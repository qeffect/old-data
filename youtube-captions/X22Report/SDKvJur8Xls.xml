  <text start="219.079" dur="5.61">well so many stories about the meeting</text>
  <text start="221.03" dur="8.069">use the rage narrative anyway fake and</text>
  <text start="224.689" dur="7.41">corrupt press so why are they pushing</text>
  <text start="229.099" dur="5.521">the story they want to show Trump is</text>
  <text start="232.099" dur="6.991">unstable and he flips out at a moment&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="234.62" dur="5.22">notice that he&amp;#39;s you know oh my god it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="241.269" dur="6.25">again this will be proven to be false</text>
  <text start="245.229" dur="4.451">Trump has been doing business for a very</text>
  <text start="247.519" dur="6.12">long time and he understands with</text>

  <text start="273.349" dur="5.281">you stay calm you put on a poker face</text>
  <text start="276.11" dur="7.049">and you show that it doesn&amp;#39;t bother you</text>
  <text start="278.63" dur="7.8">in the least that&amp;#39;s what he does any</text>
  <text start="283.159" dur="4.98">negotiator doesn&amp;#39;t all of a sudden flip</text>

  <text start="803.24" dur="5.37">testifying Clovis never knew about how</text>
  <text start="806.57" dur="4.62">burrs connection to the FBI only</text>
  <text start="808.61" dur="5.16">recently from news reports has Clovis</text>
  <text start="811.19" dur="5.16">learned about Helpers true role and that</text>
  <text start="813.77" dur="5.04">has prompted Clovis to replay his brief</text>
  <text start="816.35" dur="5.01">and seemingly inconsequential encounter</text>
  <text start="818.81" dur="3.24">with helper in light of a wealth of new</text>

  <text start="837.709" dur="5.391">anything and the reason for that is</text>
  <text start="840.26" dur="5.91">because Clovis wasn&amp;#39;t the target</text>
  <text start="843.1" dur="6.37">Halper was trying to use Clovis to get</text>
  <text start="846.17" dur="6.599">the George papadopolis that was the</text>
  <text start="849.47" dur="6.179">whole plan here go through Clovis to get</text>
  <text start="852.769" dur="6.63">the George papadopolis and this is</text>
  <text start="855.649" dur="6">exactly what happened so Clovis&amp;#39;s theory</text>
  <text start="859.399" dur="5.161">is that halper was trying to link</text>
  <text start="861.649" dur="4.891">Papadopoulos and the 30,000 plus emails</text>
  <text start="864.56" dur="3.719">that Hillary Clinton unilaterally</text>

  <text start="873.5" dur="6.24">drag George into this to say the Trump</text>
  <text start="877.37" dur="5.19">campaign tried to get access to those</text>
  <text start="879.74" dur="4.71">emails from Russia at the time it&amp;#39;s fair</text>
  <text start="882.56" dur="3.87">to say that no one in the room knew that</text>
  <text start="884.45" dur="4.47">Halper was an FBI informant it was only</text>
  <text start="886.43" dur="5.67">later that the House committees work led</text>
  <text start="888.92" dur="6.51">to the discovery of helpers role but</text>
  <text start="892.1" dur="6.81">guess what they failed this is what they</text>
  <text start="895.43" dur="6.21">tried to do George papadopolis tweeted</text>
  <text start="898.91" dur="4.77">out the following the president knows he</text>

  <text start="1460.5" dur="5.91">we see something very interesting</text>
  <text start="1462.419" dur="7.111">happening first we see the Iranian</text>
  <text start="1466.41" dur="5.94">supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</text>
  <text start="1469.53" dur="4.5">has expressed discontent over the way</text>
  <text start="1472.35" dur="3.84">the implementation of the embattled</text>
  <text start="1474.03" dur="3.81">joint comprehensive plan of action also</text>
  <text start="1476.19" dur="4.619">known as the Iranian deal where the</text>

  <text start="1482.58" dur="6.479">jcpoa but allowed for the negotiations</text>
  <text start="1485.58" dur="5.96">to be held the way the jcpoa was handled</text>
  <text start="1489.059" dur="5.22">I did not really believe in it and</text>

  <text start="1507.899" dur="6.421">deal with Obama John Kerry and many</text>

  <text start="1521.909" dur="6.21">way it was being handled hmm I wonder</text>
  <text start="1525.239" dur="8.67">what the problem is and we all know what</text>
  <text start="1528.119" dur="10.53">it is Obama paid off certain individuals</text>

  <text start="1547.229" dur="5.19">down and now there&amp;#39;s a lot of pressure</text>
  <text start="1550.44" dur="3.51">on these individuals this is why carries</text>

  <text start="1553.95" dur="3.99">there&amp;#39;s why all these people are out</text>
  <text start="1554.909" dur="6.09">there trying to stop from what is</text>
  <text start="1557.94" dur="5.279">happening because once it&amp;#39;s exposed they</text>
  <text start="1560.999" dur="5.31">are exposed and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1563.219" dur="5.971">worried about now Matt gets it seems</text>
