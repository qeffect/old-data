  <text start="30.619" dur="7.321">before the economic collapse and today</text>
  <text start="34.1" dur="8.79">it looks like the markets are up gold is</text>
  <text start="37.94" dur="10.469">up and i see that gold is over fourteen</text>
  <text start="42.89" dur="7.32">hundred dollars and I I&amp;#39;m gonna take a</text>
  <text start="48.409" dur="4.531">guess or I&amp;#39;m going to make a prediction</text>
  <text start="50.21" dur="5.699">that tomorrow that gold is slammed down</text>
  <text start="52.94" dur="7.649">and is brought below 1400 and let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="55.909" dur="9.061">if that holds true and we see out in</text>
  <text start="60.589" dur="7.291">asia the nikkei was down another seven</text>
  <text start="64.97" dur="6.33">hundred and thirty seven points and we</text>
  <text start="67.88" dur="7.53">can see the volunteer the it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="71.3" dur="8.19">volatile market over there and it seems</text>
  <text start="75.41" dur="6.39">like every time something happens people</text>
  <text start="79.49" dur="6.93">kind of blame it on something else or</text>
  <text start="81.8" dur="6.45">this is why it&amp;#39;s happening and you know</text>
  <text start="86.42" dur="5.1">we&amp;#39;re seeing this quite often now in</text>
  <text start="88.25" dur="7.14">japan and a lot of the analysts are</text>
  <text start="91.52" dur="6.8">saying that Japan is teetering and you</text>
  <text start="95.39" dur="6.24">know once it topples that is going to</text>
  <text start="98.32" dur="10.15">send ripples throughout Europe and then</text>
  <text start="101.63" dur="8.79">into America so and we&amp;#39;re seeing this</text>
  <text start="108.47" dur="3.54">you know every day it&amp;#39;s up then it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="110.42" dur="4.23">down but you know it&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="112.01" dur="4.969">falling it&amp;#39;s not making the gains its</text>
  <text start="114.65" dur="6.36">continually going down and down and down</text>
  <text start="116.979" dur="5.471">so but here in America they are propping</text>
  <text start="121.01" dur="3">up the markets with the plunge</text>
  <text start="122.45" dur="4.8">protection team and the high-frequency</text>
  <text start="124.01" dur="6.089">traders and they can keep this market</text>
  <text start="127.25" dur="5.4">going so there was an interesting</text>
  <text start="130.099" dur="5.641">article is this why social unrest in</text>
  <text start="132.65" dur="3.99">Europe has been subdued and they gave a</text>
  <text start="135.74" dur="3.9">couple</text>
  <text start="136.64" dur="8.25">charts here and if you look in Spain the</text>
  <text start="139.64" dur="10.29">unemployment benefits the max is 24</text>
  <text start="144.89" dur="9.54">months Portugal its twenty five months</text>
  <text start="149.93" dur="6.48">in Greece it&amp;#39;s twelve months and you</text>
  <text start="154.43" dur="4.71">know when you extend just like they did</text>
  <text start="156.41" dur="6.15">here in America when you extend</text>
  <text start="159.14" dur="6.15">unemployment and you continually give</text>
  <text start="162.56" dur="5.52">benefits it skews a lot of numbers these</text>
  <text start="165.29" dur="5.61">people aren&amp;#39;t in you know employed and</text>
  <text start="168.08" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re not complaining because they are</text>
  <text start="170.9" dur="5.01">receiving some type of benefit to get</text>
  <text start="172.91" dur="4.74">through the tough times but again these</text>
  <text start="175.91" dur="5.94">people who are receiving unemployment</text>
  <text start="177.65" dur="6.75">when it runs out they consider them as</text>
  <text start="181.85" dur="6.78">just dropping off and not counting them</text>
  <text start="184.4" dur="7.61">as looking for employment and this is</text>
  <text start="188.63" dur="5.76">where we get this this strange</text>
  <text start="192.01" dur="3.91">unemployment numbers and this is why</text>
  <text start="194.39" dur="3.33">when people start to look again they</text>
  <text start="195.92" dur="3.48">have to change the calculation because</text>
  <text start="197.72" dur="5.549">you know all of it wouldn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="199.4" dur="5.7">of you know why the markets going up why</text>
  <text start="203.269" dur="4.611">the economy strong but why do we have</text>
  <text start="205.1" dur="6.66">all these people looking now so</text>
  <text start="207.88" dur="6.04">basically when they drop off we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="211.76" dur="3.06">have to count them and what&amp;#39;s funny even</text>
  <text start="213.92" dur="4.89">you know like when the real estate</text>
  <text start="214.82" dur="6.09">market crashed all the Realtors I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="218.81" dur="4.429">there were thousands upon thousands of</text>
  <text start="220.91" dur="5.609">Realtors but they were never considered</text>
  <text start="223.239" dur="7.03">employed because they are contract</text>
  <text start="226.519" dur="5.101">workers so they don&amp;#39;t count but all</text>
  <text start="230.269" dur="3.661">those people who were bringing in</text>
  <text start="231.62" dur="4.79">incomes all of a sudden came to a</text>
  <text start="233.93" dur="5.94">screeching halt just think of how many</text>
  <text start="236.41" dur="5.049">realtor&amp;#39;s got out of the market and</text>
  <text start="239.87" dur="4.08">started looking for a different job or</text>
  <text start="241.459" dur="5.011">couldn&amp;#39;t find another job and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="243.95" dur="5.21">still trying to make it as a realtor but</text>
  <text start="246.47" dur="6.389">couldn&amp;#39;t sell anything at that point</text>
  <text start="249.16" dur="7.12">okay let&amp;#39;s move on here keeping the Euro</text>
  <text start="252.859" dur="6.151">afloat at all costs behind catastrophic</text>
  <text start="256.28" dur="6.57">EU unemployment now we know the</text>
  <text start="259.01" dur="8.85">unemployment is quite high in the</text>
  <text start="262.85" dur="6.57">European nations and basically you know</text>
  <text start="267.86" dur="3.27">the</text>
  <text start="269.42" dur="3.47">banks and the government&amp;#39;s tell us that</text>
  <text start="271.13" dur="4.56">the economy is getting better and</text>
  <text start="272.89" dur="6.01">everything&amp;#39;s okay but you know with</text>
  <text start="275.69" dur="5.34">everyone out of work especially across</text>
  <text start="278.9" dur="5.1">the European nations at an end in</text>
  <text start="281.03" dur="4.35">America how can they say that things are</text>
  <text start="284" dur="3.39">getting better because if people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="285.38" dur="3.96">working they&amp;#39;re not spending if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="287.39" dur="4.8">not spending how would these</text>
  <text start="289.34" dur="6.69">corporations making profits or retail</text>
  <text start="292.19" dur="5.91">stores making profits and how are they</text>
  <text start="296.03" dur="4.62">making it well you know they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="298.1" dur="6.06">because back in January February and if</text>
  <text start="300.65" dur="9.45">you look at my episodes around that time</text>
  <text start="304.16" dur="8.28">I did a report on the amount of retail</text>
  <text start="310.1" dur="4.41">stores that were closing and I went down</text>
  <text start="312.44" dur="4.11">a list of like Radio Shack was closing</text>
  <text start="314.51" dur="5.34">like 200 or so stores best buy was</text>
  <text start="316.55" dur="5.67">closing JC Penney was closing and the</text>
  <text start="319.85" dur="6.27">only reason these stores closed up shop</text>
  <text start="322.22" dur="6.54">and get rid of the employees is because</text>
  <text start="326.12" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re not making sales so let&amp;#39;s use</text>
  <text start="328.76" dur="6.38">some common sense here people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="331.13" dur="8.82">working or they have reduced salaries</text>
  <text start="335.14" dur="8.8">they don&amp;#39;t have that discretionary fund</text>
  <text start="339.95" dur="5.94">monies to spend on frivolous things so</text>
  <text start="343.94" dur="4.32">they don&amp;#39;t go shopping in these stores</text>
  <text start="345.89" dur="5.34">since the people aren&amp;#39;t shopping buying</text>
  <text start="348.26" dur="6.33">you know three more TVs or more</text>
  <text start="351.23" dur="5.61">electronics the stores aren&amp;#39;t making</text>
  <text start="354.59" dur="6.45">money and if the stores aren&amp;#39;t making</text>
  <text start="356.84" dur="7.34">money they can&amp;#39;t keep them open so now</text>
  <text start="361.04" dur="8.31">you&amp;#39;re seeing the ripple effect of</text>
  <text start="364.18" dur="7.21">everyone partially employed or people</text>
  <text start="369.35" dur="3.99">who are fully employed but making half</text>
  <text start="371.39" dur="3.63">of what they&amp;#39;re making or make it or</text>
  <text start="373.34" dur="3.69">maybe making three quarters of what they</text>
  <text start="375.02" dur="4.86">were making and they&amp;#39;re not going out to</text>
  <text start="377.03" dur="5.22">shop and we&amp;#39;re seeing this and the</text>
  <text start="379.88" dur="5.73">retail side of it is painting the</text>
  <text start="382.25" dur="7.29">picture and letting letting us know how</text>
  <text start="385.61" dur="6.72">the economy is really doing and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="389.54" dur="7.35">funny that the government numbers you</text>
  <text start="392.33" dur="6.63">know like to include gasoline sales and</text>
  <text start="396.89" dur="5.22">they they always tell us if you just</text>
  <text start="398.96" dur="4.11">listen to them retail sales have gone up</text>
  <text start="402.11" dur="3.87">and</text>
  <text start="403.07" dur="6.96">every time they say that gasoline prices</text>
  <text start="405.98" dur="8.25">have gone up but when gasoline prices go</text>
  <text start="410.03" dur="7.14">down they always let you know the reason</text>
  <text start="414.23" dur="4.89">why retail has gone down is because gas</text>
  <text start="417.17" dur="4.95">prices have fallen but when gas prices</text>
  <text start="419.12" dur="5.28">go up they never tell you it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="422.12" dur="3.72">of the gas prices they just let you they</text>
  <text start="424.4" dur="4.16">just leave that part off they just late</text>

  <text start="428.56" dur="9.76">that the retail sales are up and you</text>
  <text start="433.61" dur="7.59">know they like to leave things out in</text>
  <text start="438.32" dur="7.08">their reports and that&amp;#39;s how they get</text>
  <text start="441.2" dur="6.3">and people read this and they let you</text>

  <text start="557.21" dur="4.02">bank runs in Europe because of what</text>
  <text start="559.52" dur="3.83">happened in Cyprus but the mainstream</text>
  <text start="561.23" dur="4.65">media really didn&amp;#39;t talk about that and</text>
  <text start="563.35" dur="6.4">no one really did but there was an</text>
  <text start="565.88" dur="6.81">article that said there were many bank</text>
  <text start="569.75" dur="8.28">runs throughout Europe when this cypress</text>
  <text start="572.69" dur="9.09">thing happened and basically when when</text>
  <text start="578.03" dur="8.46">they saw the outflows they saw about 6.4</text>
  <text start="581.78" dur="7.92">billion being withdrawn from the banks</text>
  <text start="586.49" dur="5.94">and that&amp;#39;s about ten percent of its</text>
  <text start="589.7" dur="7.89">entire deposit base in one month and</text>
  <text start="592.43" dur="9.78">that&amp;#39;s what they saw being taken out now</text>
  <text start="597.59" dur="7.65">there was it&amp;#39;s funny the dollar has been</text>
  <text start="602.21" dur="7.74">going down gold now has been going up</text>
  <text start="605.24" dur="8.22">and you know why the the dollar is just</text>
  <text start="609.95" dur="7.1">a piece of paper with ink on it has no</text>
  <text start="613.46" dur="6.27">value whatsoever if you go back to</text>
  <text start="617.05" dur="4.15">Lincoln&amp;#39;s greenback is that paper worth</text>
  <text start="619.73" dur="3.51">anything or if you go back to the</text>
  <text start="621.2" dur="4.77">Confederate money is that money worth</text>
  <text start="623.24" dur="5.72">anything and I&amp;#39;m not talking about</text>
  <text start="625.97" dur="6.18">historical value if you just had a</text>
  <text start="628.96" dur="6.82">twenty-dollar bill from back during that</text>
  <text start="632.15" dur="8.7">period it is worth noting because no one</text>
  <text start="635.78" dur="8.93">believes in it gold has been around for</text>
  <text start="640.85" dur="7.32">thousands upon thousands of years and if</text>
  <text start="644.71" dur="7.24">you notice everything always goes back</text>
  <text start="648.17" dur="8.4">to gold and silver even though the</text>
  <text start="651.95" dur="6.93">Federal Reserve and other mainstream</text>
  <text start="656.57" dur="6.12">news outlets tell you that gold is not</text>
  <text start="658.88" dur="7.04">money if it wasn&amp;#39;t and they truly</text>
  <text start="662.69" dur="5.94">believe that they would not hold it</text>
  <text start="665.92" dur="4.37">banks would not hold it countries would</text>
  <text start="668.63" dur="6.18">not hold it</text>
  <text start="670.29" dur="8.31">um Federal Reserve would not hold it</text>
  <text start="674.81" dur="8.709">they would not buy it they would not</text>
  <text start="678.6" dur="8">have it at all gold and silver they are</text>
  <text start="683.519" dur="5.641">the insurance policy against paper</text>
  <text start="686.6" dur="5.409">because they know when paper collapses</text>
  <text start="689.16" dur="5.669">it&amp;#39;s worth nothing but if you have gold</text>
  <text start="692.009" dur="10.371">and silver it&amp;#39;s worth something think</text>
  <text start="694.829" dur="9.601">about that right now the student loan</text>
  <text start="702.38" dur="6.55">delinquency rate in the United States</text>
  <text start="704.43" dur="6.06">has hit a brand-new high 37 million</text>
  <text start="708.93" dur="4.409">Americans currently have outstanding</text>
  <text start="710.49" dur="4.86">student loans and the delinquency rate</text>
  <text start="713.339" dur="5.151">on those student loans has now reached a</text>
  <text start="715.35" dur="6.21">level near a level never seen before</text>
  <text start="718.49" dur="8.94">Gino is this really that hard to figure</text>
  <text start="721.56" dur="11.79">out if we have among the youth an</text>
  <text start="727.43" dur="9.839">unemployment rate of fifty percent how</text>
  <text start="733.35" dur="7.38">the hell are these students going to</text>
  <text start="737.269" dur="6.88">repay their loans or even make payments</text>
  <text start="740.73" dur="5.46">on their loans if they cannot find a job</text>
  <text start="744.149" dur="5.821">and those students who have found a job</text>
  <text start="746.19" dur="9.72">or don&amp;#39;t those jobs you don&amp;#39;t even need</text>
  <text start="749.97" dur="8.34">a college degree to work there plus most</text>
  <text start="755.91" dur="4.44">I would say almost a hundred percent of</text>
  <text start="758.31" dur="5.339">these kids let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s just say ninety</text>
  <text start="760.35" dur="5.849">five percent of these kids are working</text>
  <text start="763.649" dur="5.281">at these low-paid jobs and living at</text>
  <text start="766.199" dur="8.161">home and still can&amp;#39;t make the payments</text>
  <text start="768.93" dur="9.24">on their loans i have my wife&amp;#39;s and her</text>
  <text start="774.36" dur="5.789">son is graduating college and he has</text>
