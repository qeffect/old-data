  <text start="33.36" dur="4.41">when it to report my name is dave and</text>
  <text start="34.95" dur="6.21">this is episode 1083 a and today&amp;#39;s date</text>
  <text start="37.77" dur="6">is sep tember 23rd 2016 and the title of</text>
  <text start="41.16" dur="4.56">the episode is UN annual report states</text>
  <text start="43.77" dur="5.039">we are on the verge of the third leg of</text>
  <text start="45.72" dur="6.12">a global financial crisis let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="48.809" dur="5.611">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="51.84" dur="5.67">looking at the economy we can see that</text>
  <text start="54.42" dur="6.93">up to this point everything that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="57.51" dur="8.94">looked at going back many years we have</text>
  <text start="61.35" dur="7.56">only seen the economy decline we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="66.45" dur="5.61">seen more stores open up we haven&amp;#39;t seen</text>
  <text start="68.91" dur="5.91">more people getting hired we actually</text>
  <text start="72.06" dur="4.29">see the opposite occurring we see a lot</text>
  <text start="74.82" dur="4.22">of manipulation of the statistical</text>
  <text start="76.35" dur="5.4">numbers but when we look at the economic</text>
  <text start="79.04" dur="7.9">indicators and we look at the economics</text>
  <text start="81.75" dur="8.64">of real people we see that this entire</text>
  <text start="86.94" dur="6">system is rapidly deteriorating very</text>
  <text start="90.39" dur="5.22">very quickly and the government right</text>
  <text start="92.94" dur="4.92">now they&amp;#39;re losing control of a</text>
  <text start="95.61" dur="3.929">narrative because they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="97.86" dur="4.14">telling us that it&amp;#39;s fine the stock</text>
  <text start="99.539" dur="4.681">market&amp;#39;s going up and everything looks</text>
  <text start="102" dur="6.979">good but when we look at everything like</text>
  <text start="104.22" dur="7.86">retail GDP unemployment manufacturing</text>
  <text start="108.979" dur="6.31">you know everything that tells the story</text>
  <text start="112.08" dur="6.12">of how the u.s. is really doing well all</text>
  <text start="115.289" dur="6.33">that is declining rapidly and a lot of</text>
  <text start="118.2" dur="6.089">the data is a lot worse than 2008 during</text>
  <text start="121.619" dur="6">the Great Recession and we have periods</text>
  <text start="124.289" dur="6.39">of time where we&amp;#39;re in this recessionary</text>
  <text start="127.619" dur="5.071">territory and we can see the eurozone</text>
  <text start="130.679" dur="4.17">well they&amp;#39;re worse off than the United</text>
  <text start="132.69" dur="4.8">States we see the eurozone business</text>
  <text start="134.849" dur="5.521">activity well it is expanded at its</text>
  <text start="137.49" dur="7.109">weakest rate for this month since the</text>
  <text start="140.37" dur="7.32">start of 2015 markets composite survey</text>
  <text start="144.599" dur="6.451">showed a big split between manufacturers</text>
  <text start="147.69" dur="6.299">and struggling service sectors the</text>
  <text start="151.05" dur="6.45">eurozone flash composite Purchasing</text>
  <text start="153.989" dur="5.281">Manager index well this is seen as a</text>
  <text start="157.5" dur="6.02">good overall growth indicator well it</text>
  <text start="159.27" dur="9.14">fell to 52.6 from 52.9 in all</text>
  <text start="163.52" dur="8.25">and we can see right now that this</text>
  <text start="168.41" dur="5.58">system is rapidly deteriorating I know</text>
  <text start="171.77" dur="4.02">the US government the corporate media</text>
  <text start="173.99" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re going to continually tell you</text>
  <text start="175.79" dur="5.78">that everything is fine they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="178.04" dur="6.66">continually lie until the very very end</text>
  <text start="181.57" dur="5.26">when people are rioting and protesting</text>
  <text start="184.7" dur="4.53">in front of the Capitol they&amp;#39;ll still</text>
  <text start="186.83" dur="7.91">tell you it&amp;#39;s okay that everyone has a</text>
  <text start="189.23" dur="9.42">job but what we see is that there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="194.74" dur="5.35">increase of people who are living in</text>
  <text start="198.65" dur="3.87">homeless shelters in New York and we</text>
  <text start="200.09" dur="6.9">mentioned this briefly yesterday in the</text>
  <text start="202.52" dur="7.26">report but what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="206.99" dur="6.09">this is that when you look at this data</text>
  <text start="209.78" dur="8.72">and they say sixty percent increase from</text>
  <text start="213.08" dur="7.2">july two thousand eight to july of 2011</text>
  <text start="218.5" dur="4.74">homeless shelter remained fairly</text>
  <text start="220.28" dur="6.72">consistent around eight thousand and</text>
  <text start="223.24" dur="6.52">then after july twenty eleven to this</text>
  <text start="227" dur="6.18">point over the following what is that</text>
  <text start="229.76" dur="7.41">five years or so there&amp;#39;s been an</text>
  <text start="233.18" dur="6.72">increase of families living in homeless</text>
  <text start="237.17" dur="6.21">shelters to nearly 13,000 sixty percent</text>
  <text start="239.9" dur="7.47">increase is this really what a recovery</text>
  <text start="243.38" dur="6.51">looks like when all of a sudden coming</text>
  <text start="247.37" dur="6.6">out of the Great Recession we see an</text>
  <text start="249.89" dur="5.7">increase this large of people who can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="253.97" dur="2.88">stay in their homes and we know that</text>
  <text start="255.59" dur="5.97">people are going for that emergency</text>
  <text start="256.85" dur="9.36">shelter grant so this recovery makes no</text>
  <text start="261.56" dur="7.5">sense and we see the housing market it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="266.21" dur="5.52">continually declining we know Larry on</text>
  <text start="269.06" dur="4.89">you can&amp;#39;t figure it out can&amp;#39;t figure out</text>
  <text start="271.73" dur="3.84">why you know since everyone&amp;#39;s employed</text>
  <text start="273.95" dur="3.78">why aren&amp;#39;t they buying houses and why</text>
  <text start="275.57" dur="4.8">are applications for mortgages right now</text>
  <text start="277.73" dur="5.88">why are they have they tumbled to 7.3</text>
  <text start="280.37" dur="10.23">percent last week with interest rates at</text>
  <text start="283.61" dur="9.24">such a low point here and banks allowing</text>
  <text start="290.6" dur="5.21">you to purchase a home with really no</text>
  <text start="292.85" dur="6.89">down deposit</text>
  <text start="295.81" dur="6.51">it makes no sense we see markets</text>
  <text start="299.74" dur="5.91">manufacturing PMI print for September</text>
  <text start="302.32" dur="7.8">missed expectations of 52 dropping to a</text>
  <text start="305.65" dur="6.6">three-month low at 50 1.4 and we see</text>
  <text start="310.12" dur="7.35">that new orders inventories they all</text>
  <text start="312.25" dur="9.81">declined we&amp;#39;re seeing the world trade in</text>
  <text start="317.47" dur="8.64">merchandise this is the global</text>
  <text start="322.06" dur="6.419">goods-producing economy well this is</text>
  <text start="326.11" dur="5.34">declining and this is coming out of the</text>
  <text start="328.479" dur="6.421">CB cpb Netherlands Bureau of Economic</text>
  <text start="331.45" dur="5.43">Policy Analysis this is a division of</text>
  <text start="334.9" dur="3.63">the Ministry of Economic Affairs they</text>
  <text start="336.88" dur="5.039">just release their preliminary data of</text>
  <text start="338.53" dur="8.27">its merchandise world trade monitor the</text>
  <text start="341.919" dur="8.641">index fell by 1.1 percent from June to</text>
  <text start="346.8" dur="7.089">113 point for this is the lowest since</text>
  <text start="350.56" dur="7.56">may of 2015 and we can see the world</text>
  <text start="353.889" dur="9.001">trade is on a slow volatile grind lower</text>
  <text start="358.12" dur="8.7">and this is what we&amp;#39;ve seen before as we</text>
  <text start="362.89" dur="6.69">moved into the Great Recession now for</text>
  <text start="366.82" dur="6.21">many consumers they don&amp;#39;t have a whole</text>
  <text start="369.58" dur="5.37">lot of money left to buy things you know</text>
  <text start="373.03" dur="5.07">the gadgets the foods the apparel all</text>
  <text start="374.95" dur="8.42">those other things and this is showing</text>
  <text start="378.1" dur="8.039">up now in certain economic indicators</text>
  <text start="383.37" dur="5.98">showing us that we are in a downward</text>
  <text start="386.139" dur="6.84">trend to a depression I believe we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="389.35" dur="8.61">already in a recession and we could sue</text>
  <text start="392.979" dur="9.031">already the Atlanta Fed already slashed</text>
  <text start="397.96" dur="7.47">GDP you know they say when 3.6 or 3.8</text>
  <text start="402.01" dur="4.64">they and they had a lower it to 2.9 and</text>
  <text start="405.43" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;s going to go even lower than that</text>
  <text start="406.65" dur="5.62">New York Fed did the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="409.24" dur="4.95">this is 0 this fourth quarter third coat</text>
  <text start="412.27" dur="3.63">it&amp;#39;s going to be incredible this is what</text>
  <text start="414.19" dur="3.27">we&amp;#39;re predicting we&amp;#39;re predicting you</text>
  <text start="415.9" dur="5.43">know three-point-two percent it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="417.46" dur="6.78">to be fantastic well guess what they</text>
  <text start="421.33" dur="4.55">just slashed their prediction and now</text>
  <text start="424.24" dur="4.76">they expect two-point-three percent</text>
  <text start="425.88" dur="3.12">annualized growth</text>
  <text start="429.46" dur="7.96">so when we look at this we can see that</text>
  <text start="434.56" dur="5.29">all of it is a lie to make you believe</text>
  <text start="437.42" dur="6.24">what do we have coming up the elections</text>
  <text start="439.85" dur="6.03">and they&amp;#39;re trying to make you believe</text>
  <text start="443.66" dur="3.6">that still everything is fine now people</text>
  <text start="445.88" dur="2.34">will look at this and they say well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="447.26" dur="5.04">only two-point-three percent</text>
  <text start="448.22" dur="7.04">two-point-nine percent but you know that</text>
  <text start="452.3" dur="6.83">this is going to be much much lower</text>
  <text start="455.26" dur="9">think about what they said the largest</text>
  <text start="459.13" dur="9.37">contributors to the GDP are</text>
  <text start="464.26" dur="8.65">manufacturing retail sales housing and</text>
  <text start="468.5" dur="9.96">construction and the New York Fed is</text>
  <text start="472.91" dur="8.49">reporting that this is the problem well</text>
  <text start="478.46" dur="6.45">isn&amp;#39;t that pretty much everything in the</text>
  <text start="481.4" dur="5.67">GDP because we know seventy percent is</text>
  <text start="484.91" dur="4.89">spending well of course we have</text>
  <text start="487.07" dur="5.76">Obamacare which allows the government to</text>
  <text start="489.8" dur="5.58">completely manipulate the GDP because as</text>
  <text start="492.83" dur="5.04">premiums go up they can say look</text>
  <text start="495.38" dur="5.01">spendings going up but is really</text>
  <text start="497.87" dur="4.89">spending going up or are people being</text>
  <text start="500.39" dur="5.13">forced to pay more for something that</text>
  <text start="502.76" dur="6.96">they don&amp;#39;t even get there&amp;#39;s no benefit</text>
  <text start="505.52" dur="8.48">to it so we can see right now that this</text>
  <text start="509.72" dur="7.92">whole thing it is rapidly falling apart</text>
  <text start="514" dur="6.91">now the feds myth is completely</text>
  <text start="517.64" dur="5.87">unraveling before our eyes and of course</text>
  <text start="520.91" dur="4.92">the latest myth is being promoted</text>
  <text start="523.51" dur="6.1">everywhere that median income growth</text>
  <text start="525.83" dur="6.33">exploded higher last year and we can see</text>
  <text start="529.61" dur="5.85">right now that I guess the people that</text>
  <text start="532.16" dur="6.72">are reporting on this really didn&amp;#39;t read</text>
  <text start="535.46" dur="4.98">or understand the information and they</text>
  <text start="538.88" dur="3.9">just went with it and manipulated a</text>
  <text start="540.44" dur="5.04">massage number and said listen yes we do</text>
  <text start="542.78" dur="5.31">have this well John Williams he read the</text>
  <text start="545.48" dur="6.32">report and he found something very</text>
  <text start="548.09" dur="7.53">interesting that these census has</text>
  <text start="551.8" dur="6.61">adjusted its methodology to include what</text>
  <text start="555.62" dur="6.9">interest income would be if rates were</text>
  <text start="558.41" dur="5.76">not at zero so the census was able to</text>
  <text start="562.52" dur="3.78">claimed interest income increased by a</text>
  <text start="564.17" dur="3.84">hundred and eleven percent during a</text>
  <text start="566.3" dur="5.22">period in which the US interest rate was</text>
  <text start="568.01" dur="5.73">only point two five percent now who</text>
  <text start="571.52" dur="5.16">controls the census that&amp;#39;s right the</text>
  <text start="573.74" dur="5.55">White House so this must be a complete</text>
  <text start="576.68" dur="5.04">coincidence that during an election year</text>
  <text start="579.29" dur="8.22">suddenly the data got so much better</text>
  <text start="581.72" dur="8.61">based on ridiculous assumptions so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="587.51" dur="5.64">led to believe that jobs are so strong</text>
  <text start="590.33" dur="5.82">that the u.s. is completely fully</text>
  <text start="593.15" dur="4.98">employed well setting aside the fact</text>
  <text start="596.15" dur="4.35">that 94 million people are out of work</text>
  <text start="598.13" dur="6.48">out of the workforce 46 million people</text>
  <text start="600.5" dur="6.75">are on food stamps and we can see when</text>
  <text start="604.61" dur="6.45">someone gets a job that person begins to</text>
  <text start="607.25" dur="6.48">pay income tax right you pay income tax</text>
  <text start="611.06" dur="4.08">and the government uses it to pay down</text>
  <text start="613.73" dur="3.6">the debt of course they&amp;#39;re not bringing</text>
  <text start="615.14" dur="4.98">in enough to pay down the debt so they</text>
  <text start="617.33" dur="4.05">have to borrow more money so if more and</text>
  <text start="620.12" dur="6.45">more people are getting employed with</text>
  <text start="621.38" dur="7.98">this fantastic job economy this</text>
  <text start="626.57" dur="4.86">recovered job type of economy and</text>
  <text start="629.36" dur="5.85">they&amp;#39;re telling us that wages are</text>
  <text start="631.43" dur="10.67">increasing and everything is better why</text>
  <text start="635.21" dur="9.99">then has income taxes that are withheld</text>
  <text start="642.1" dur="6.7">why have they fallen for the last two</text>
  <text start="645.2" dur="7.1">years so what they&amp;#39;re trying to show us</text>
  <text start="648.8" dur="6.87">is that employment is getting better</text>
  <text start="652.3" dur="6.07">we&amp;#39;re almost at full employment but tax</text>
  <text start="655.67" dur="6.72">revenue for the last two years is going</text>
  <text start="658.37" dur="7.95">in the opposite direction it makes no</text>
  <text start="662.39" dur="6.6">sense and if we look at the state</text>
  <text start="666.32" dur="4.11">personal income tax and this is coming</text>
  <text start="668.99" dur="4.02">out of the Rockefeller Institute of</text>
  <text start="670.43" dur="6.39">government they just released a report</text>
  <text start="673.01" dur="7.83">saying that the state personal income</text>
  <text start="676.82" dur="7.14">tax revenues well guess what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="680.84" dur="4.59">declining they only grew by one point</text>
  <text start="683.96" dur="3.99">eight percent year-over-year in the</text>
  <text start="685.43" dur="4.5">first quarter of 2016 the second quarter</text>
  <text start="687.95" dur="4.01">shows a decline of three-point-three</text>
  <text start="689.93" dur="2.03">percent</text>
  <text start="693.08" dur="5.91">so this is showing us that if we are</text>
  <text start="697.43" dur="4.05">getting more jobs and we&amp;#39;re almost at</text>
  <text start="698.99" dur="3.93">full employment revenue tax revenue</text>
  <text start="701.48" dur="3.6">should be moving up in the same</text>
  <text start="702.92" dur="4.11">direction now the only reason this would</text>
  <text start="705.08" dur="4.89">be going in the opposite direction is</text>
  <text start="707.03" dur="5.91">that people left high-paying jobs and</text>
  <text start="709.97" dur="5.13">they got part-time jobs people got laid</text>
  <text start="712.94" dur="7.01">off from these incredible jobs and they</text>
  <text start="715.1" dur="9.66">can&amp;#39;t find jobs so once again we see a</text>
  <text start="719.95" dur="10.09">lie an illusion it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="724.76" dur="6.81">and we can see the UN the UN conference</text>
  <text start="730.04" dur="4.88">on Trade and Development annual report</text>
  <text start="731.57" dur="5.97">which was released September 22nd 2016</text>
  <text start="734.92" dur="6.43">they&amp;#39;re suggesting that the third leg of</text>
  <text start="737.54" dur="8.28">the world&amp;#39;s depression is yet to come</text>
  <text start="741.35" dur="6.6">and we can see alarm bells have been</text>
  <text start="745.82" dur="4.77">ringing over the explosion of corporate</text>
  <text start="747.95" dur="5.7">debt levels in all the different</text>
  <text start="750.59" dur="9.72">economies they now exceed 25 trillion</text>
  <text start="753.65" dur="12.5">and the UN economists think that this is</text>
  <text start="760.31" dur="9.48">imminent this next financial crisis is</text>
  <text start="766.15" dur="5.82">going to be epic we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="769.79" dur="5.13">corporate defaults we&amp;#39;re going to see a</text>
  <text start="771.97" dur="5.41">derivative explosion we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="774.92" dur="4.08">a lot of people out of work we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="777.38" dur="4.71">to see the housing market completely</text>
  <text start="779" dur="6.09">take a dive which is going to throw</text>
  <text start="782.09" dur="5.01">everything over the side of the ship and</text>
  <text start="785.09" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot worse because</text>
  <text start="787.1" dur="5.79">real estate is attached to pretty much</text>
  <text start="789.89" dur="4.65">everything once the derivatives go</text>
