  <text start="106.09" dur="5.49">they don&amp;#39;t like anything competing with</text>
  <text start="109" dur="6.45">their fiat currency and this includes</text>
  <text start="111.58" dur="5.25">gold silver crypto currencies and this</text>
  <text start="115.45" dur="5.16">is why they go out of their way to</text>
  <text start="116.83" dur="5.849">demonize these other types of currencies</text>
  <text start="120.61" dur="3.42">they don&amp;#39;t want anyone to use them they</text>
  <text start="122.679" dur="4.381">want to make sure that everyone believes</text>
  <text start="124.03" dur="4.41">that they&amp;#39;re not good as a currency you</text>
  <text start="127.06" dur="4.259">shouldn&amp;#39;t have them you shouldn&amp;#39;t own</text>
  <text start="128.44" dur="4.73">them criminals use it and this is</text>
  <text start="131.319" dur="4.081">continuing on and we can see there are</text>
  <text start="133.17" dur="4.72">government&amp;#39;s there are central banks</text>
  <text start="135.4" dur="4.29">that definitely do not want it and there</text>
  <text start="137.89" dur="2.91">are other governments that are not</text>
  <text start="139.69" dur="2.939">controlled by the private western</text>
  <text start="140.8" dur="4.65">central bank system that sees</text>
  <text start="142.629" dur="5.131">cryptocurrencies as an excellent</text>
  <text start="145.45" dur="5.52">alternative and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="147.76" dur="6.89">now is a separation of these countries</text>
  <text start="150.97" dur="7.89">and a war going on on what currencies</text>
  <text start="154.65" dur="7.39">countries the people will use and we see</text>
  <text start="158.86" dur="7.17">right now out in India India they have</text>
  <text start="162.04" dur="6.36">banned Bitcoin wallets and any type of</text>
  <text start="166.03" dur="5.25">cryptocurrency services and basically</text>
  <text start="168.4" dur="4.83">the 1.3 billion residents will not be</text>
  <text start="171.28" dur="4.26">able to invest in Bitcoin or other</text>
  <text start="173.23" dur="3.78">virtual currencies any time soon now</text>
  <text start="175.54" dur="3.69">this is coming from the economic times</text>
  <text start="177.01" dur="4.619">the Reserve Bank of India has issued a</text>
  <text start="179.23" dur="4.41">blanket ban on all cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="181.629" dur="5.261">trading you will not be able to buy</text>
  <text start="183.64" dur="5.26">cryptocurrency via banks or a wallets in</text>
  <text start="186.89" dur="4.65">India anymore is what the Reserve Bank</text>
  <text start="188.9" dur="6">of India is saying and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="191.54" dur="5.07">right now is basically country&amp;#39;s private</text>
  <text start="194.9" dur="5.16">western central banks they are now</text>
  <text start="196.61" dur="6.57">pushing their agenda and we know we have</text>
  <text start="200.06" dur="4.74">known all along their agenda is to do</text>
  <text start="203.18" dur="3.24">the same thing they did with gold now</text>
  <text start="204.8" dur="4.35">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this</text>
  <text start="206.42" dur="5.61">central banks as they were demonizing</text>
  <text start="209.15" dur="5.309">gold and silver and everything else they</text>
  <text start="212.03" dur="4.11">ramped up on those precious metals</text>
  <text start="214.459" dur="3.691">making sure they get it away from</text>
  <text start="216.14" dur="4.02">everyone else the same thing is</text>
  <text start="218.15" dur="4.92">happening with crypto currencies they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="220.16" dur="4.98">making sure that nobody else owns them</text>
  <text start="223.07" dur="5.28">and they control the markets through the</text>
  <text start="225.14" dur="6.39">paper market and what they do is they</text>
  <text start="228.35" dur="6.359">dump a lot of Bitcoin they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="231.53" dur="6.959">buying it up we see out in Japan with</text>
  <text start="234.709" dur="5.371">the amount Cox Fiasco they&amp;#39;re dumping a</text>
  <text start="238.489" dur="4.141">lot of crypto currencies this has all</text>
  <text start="240.08" dur="5.73">been planned from the beginning to</text>
  <text start="242.63" dur="5.52">basically build Bitcoin up make everyone</text>
  <text start="245.81" dur="4.679">look at cryptocurrency tell everyone</text>
  <text start="248.15" dur="5.28">that drug dealers use it it&amp;#39;s in a</text>
  <text start="250.489" dur="5.97">bubble and it&amp;#39;s very volatile and what</text>
  <text start="253.43" dur="6.27">then what they do is they then just dump</text>
  <text start="256.459" dur="5.28">it and they show everyone see this is</text>
  <text start="259.7" dur="4.59">why you shouldn&amp;#39;t be doing this this is</text>
  <text start="261.739" dur="6.331">why you need us to protect you from it</text>
  <text start="264.29" dur="7.29">now this is very interesting because the</text>
  <text start="268.07" dur="6.21">central banks they are attacking crypto</text>
  <text start="271.58" dur="5.339">currency they&amp;#39;re saying listen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="274.28" dur="5.699">doing this because we are protecting</text>
  <text start="276.919" dur="4.321">investors from volatility now let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="279.979" dur="3.661">think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="281.24" dur="5.3">when did it become the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="283.64" dur="6.48">business to protect people from</text>
  <text start="286.54" dur="5.499">volatility or what people want to do</text>
  <text start="290.12" dur="5.28">with their funds do they protect people</text>
  <text start="292.039" dur="7.201">from gambling no do they protect people</text>
  <text start="295.4" dur="5.37">in the stock market no if people want to</text>
  <text start="299.24" dur="3.42">invest and it&amp;#39;s a poor investment guess</text>
  <text start="300.77" dur="3.92">what it&amp;#39;s their losses so all of a</text>
  <text start="302.66" dur="4.59">sudden they&amp;#39;re very concerned about</text>
  <text start="304.69" dur="4.39">cryptocurrency and how volatile it is</text>
  <text start="307.25" dur="8.16">they weren&amp;#39;t very concerned when the</text>
  <text start="309.08" dur="8.64">market went down in 2008 1929 1933 2001</text>
  <text start="315.41" dur="4.77">they didn&amp;#39;t help people out back then</text>
  <text start="317.72" dur="3.06">they didn&amp;#39;t warn people they told us we</text>
  <text start="320.18" dur="2.76">weren&amp;#39;t for</text>
  <text start="320.78" dur="4.02">the recession in 2008 don&amp;#39;t worry about</text>
  <text start="322.94" dur="4.17">it everything&amp;#39;s contained everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="324.8" dur="4.53">good so you can see right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="327.11" dur="4.559">full of it that&amp;#39;s not why they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="329.33" dur="5.7">this they&amp;#39;re doing it because it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="331.669" dur="5.011">threat to their system period we see</text>
  <text start="335.03" dur="3.72">Venezuela well they&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="336.68" dur="3.87">opposite they&amp;#39;re saying and they would</text>
  <text start="338.75" dur="4.59">like what they would like to do is they</text>
  <text start="340.55" dur="5.79">would like to pay for Russian imports</text>
  <text start="343.34" dur="5.43">with cryptocurrency we see Russia moving</text>
  <text start="346.34" dur="4.5">in that area so we could see that</text>
  <text start="348.77" dur="3.899">countries the private western central</text>
  <text start="350.84" dur="3.96">banks the countries that control their</text>
  <text start="352.669" dur="4.681">central banks they&amp;#39;re taking opposite</text>
  <text start="354.8" dur="4.26">sides of the road here and we could see</text>
  <text start="357.35" dur="3.09">why there are many private western</text>
  <text start="359.06" dur="2.58">central banks are saying you know you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="360.44" dur="3.06">not going to use anything but what we</text>
  <text start="361.64" dur="3.54">say because they want a centralized</text>
  <text start="363.5" dur="3.75">system they want to control everything</text>
  <text start="365.18" dur="3.989">this is why they started out right from</text>
  <text start="367.25" dur="4.2">the very beginning demonizing</text>
  <text start="369.169" dur="5.25">cryptocurrencies the same way they tell</text>
  <text start="371.45" dur="5.07">us that gold is a barbarous relic nobody</text>
  <text start="374.419" dur="5.491">uses it anymore it&amp;#39;s not worth anything</text>
  <text start="376.52" dur="5.25">and they continually try to prove to the</text>
  <text start="379.91" dur="4.74">world that it isn&amp;#39;t worth anything by</text>
  <text start="381.77" dur="5.459">suppressing the prices we see right now</text>
  <text start="384.65" dur="4.829">the u.s. is reporting the biggest trade</text>
  <text start="387.229" dur="6.181">deficit since the financial crisis and</text>
  <text start="389.479" dur="7.201">once again as we can see that we cannot</text>
  <text start="393.41" dur="6.69">fix the current system the current</text>
  <text start="396.68" dur="6.12">system has been destroyed by the central</text>
  <text start="400.1" dur="5.52">bank&amp;#39;s deep state and everyone else that</text>
  <text start="402.8" dur="6.179">had their hands in this they created</text>
  <text start="405.62" dur="5.88">these ridiculous globalist trade deals</text>
  <text start="408.979" dur="5.461">they moved everything out of this</text>
  <text start="411.5" dur="6.81">country to other areas like China this</text>
  <text start="414.44" dur="6.63">was all being done during the last 50</text>
  <text start="418.31" dur="4.859">years and no one really noticed it</text>
  <text start="421.07" dur="5.099">because they knew that their system</text>
  <text start="423.169" dur="5.461">wouldn&amp;#39;t last that long they began doing</text>
  <text start="426.169" dur="5.191">this in the 70s as soon as they came off</text>
  <text start="428.63" dur="5.25">the gold standard they started to switch</text>
  <text start="431.36" dur="3.99">everything up and they slowly do this</text>
  <text start="433.88" dur="4.11">over time they ramped it up at the very</text>
  <text start="435.35" dur="5.4">end but they had to slowly move</text>
  <text start="437.99" dur="4.56">manufacturing they implement more</text>
  <text start="440.75" dur="3.39">regulations to make it difficult for</text>
  <text start="442.55" dur="3.69">businesses to stay in the United States</text>
  <text start="444.14" dur="4.29">and this is what happens because they</text>
  <text start="446.24" dur="5.01">knew over time they were going to have</text>
  <text start="448.43" dur="4.5">to restart the system someplace else now</text>
  <text start="451.25" dur="3.03">Trump is trying to get other countries</text>
  <text start="452.93" dur="4.38">on</text>
  <text start="454.28" dur="4.77">bored with these tariffs trying to start</text>
  <text start="457.31" dur="4.05">this trade war and again he like he said</text>
  <text start="459.05" dur="3.57">there is no trade war the United States</text>
  <text start="461.36" dur="2.85">already lost the war and what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="462.62" dur="4.74">trying to do is he&amp;#39;s trying to get a lot</text>
  <text start="464.21" dur="7.32">more countries together to accelerate</text>
  <text start="467.36" dur="8.13">the collapse of the system now China is</text>
  <text start="471.53" dur="6.24">out there and they&amp;#39;re saying listen we</text>
  <text start="475.49" dur="3.899">can use the nuclear option if you want</text>
  <text start="477.77" dur="4.5">an open trade war and you&amp;#39;ll bring in</text>
  <text start="479.389" dur="6.571">other countries in here we can dump the</text>
  <text start="482.27" dur="6.33">US Treasury bills and we can start</text>
  <text start="485.96" dur="5.94">selling them not by the millions but by</text>
  <text start="488.6" dur="7.01">the billions or hundreds of billions and</text>
  <text start="491.9" dur="7.08">we could rip your economy apart this is</text>
  <text start="495.61" dur="6.67">exactly what Trump is looking for this</text>
  <text start="498.98" dur="5.63">is the plan that Trump Xi Jingping Putin</text>
  <text start="502.28" dur="5.88">and the rest they&amp;#39;ve come together and</text>
  <text start="504.61" dur="6.55">this is all being orchestrated behind</text>
  <text start="508.16" dur="5.069">the scenes to make everyone believe that</text>
  <text start="511.16" dur="4.319">he doesn&amp;#39;t know what he&amp;#39;s doing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="513.229" dur="4.74">starting trade wars this is going to be</text>
  <text start="515.479" dur="4.231">a disaster for the economy translation</text>
  <text start="517.969" dur="4.5">for all this this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="519.71" dur="4.44">disaster to the central bank economy we</text>
  <text start="522.469" dur="4.471">have to be very clear about this that</text>
  <text start="524.15" dur="5.46">this is not a an economy that is</text>
  <text start="526.94" dur="4.95">beneficial to the people of the United</text>
  <text start="529.61" dur="5.31">States or the world this is a central</text>
  <text start="531.89" dur="4.949">bank economy which is beneficial to</text>
  <text start="534.92" dur="4.86">those who are running the Central Bank</text>
  <text start="536.839" dur="6.931">the Rothschilds those who are in power</text>
  <text start="539.78" dur="5.73">in Europe the Fed the bankers that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="543.77" dur="4.98">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="545.51" dur="6.24">so we could see right now that things</text>
  <text start="548.75" dur="6.089">are being pushed and it looks like at</text>
  <text start="551.75" dur="5.67">this time he&amp;#39;s going all out because he</text>
  <text start="554.839" dur="4.111">realizes that he needs to bring the</text>
  <text start="557.42" dur="3.72">system down because we&amp;#39;ve been watching</text>
  <text start="558.95" dur="5.67">and looking and analyzing all these</text>
  <text start="561.14" dur="6.21">indicators and we see that the real</text>
  <text start="564.62" dur="3.719">economy is ripping itself apart now</text>
  <text start="567.35" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;re going to go through this</text>
  <text start="568.339" dur="4.291">transition and this transition like I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="571.31" dur="5.13">said many times before it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="572.63" dur="4.92">very very bumpy and again what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="576.44" dur="2.49">gonna see out of the corporate media</text>
  <text start="577.55" dur="3.09">what we&amp;#39;re gonna see out of the central</text>
  <text start="578.93" dur="4.68">banks they&amp;#39;re gonna start making up</text>
  <text start="580.64" dur="5.13">stories of why the economy is not doing</text>
  <text start="583.61" dur="3.63">well they&amp;#39;re going to try to gain the</text>
  <text start="585.77" dur="3.42">narrative and Trump</text>
  <text start="587.24" dur="4.469">is gonna be on the other side calling</text>
  <text start="589.19" dur="3.899">out fake news I mean this is how I see</text>
  <text start="591.709" dur="3.151">it going down just like he&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="593.089" dur="3.961">everything else and every time the</text>
  <text start="594.86" dur="4.56">central bank the corporate media is out</text>
  <text start="597.05" dur="3.12">there trying to explain why this is</text>
  <text start="599.42" dur="3.539">happening</text>
  <text start="600.17" dur="4.83">Trump is going to take control of the</text>
  <text start="602.959" dur="3.721">narrative and say no the reason why this</text>
  <text start="605" dur="3.75">is happening is because this this and</text>
  <text start="606.68" dur="4.56">that the central bank the core media</text>
  <text start="608.75" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re fake news they&amp;#39;re telling you a</text>

  <text start="613.61" dur="4.71">on between the two factions and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="616.73" dur="4.56">gonna have to wait and see to see who</text>
  <text start="618.32" dur="4.889">gains the narrative because whoever is</text>
  <text start="621.29" dur="5.549">the winner of the narrative of the story</text>
  <text start="623.209" dur="7.141">whoever the people believe and in the</text>
  <text start="626.839" dur="6.391">end well that individual or the group of</text>
  <text start="630.35" dur="5.64">people they will be able to control what</text>
  <text start="633.23" dur="5.79">happens next because if for example if</text>
  <text start="635.99" dur="5.64">Trump can come out and say listen fake</text>
  <text start="639.02" dur="4.17">news this is the proof fake news this is</text>
  <text start="641.63" dur="4.05">the proof and prove to the American</text>
