  <text start="472.459" dur="5.64">should say the larger banks insulated</text>
  <text start="476.029" dur="5.18">themselves from all of this because they</text>
  <text start="478.099" dur="5.82">knew exactly what was going to happen</text>

  <text start="494.749" dur="6.48">do see things changing Trump and the</text>
  <text start="497.36" dur="7.859">Patriots they are gaining control of the</text>
  <text start="501.229" dur="7.201">system and we see right now that Trump</text>
  <text start="505.219" dur="6.151">his main mission is to keep the economy</text>
  <text start="508.43" dur="4.32">looking fantastic even though the</text>

  <text start="512.75" dur="6.779">scenes is doing very very poorly we can</text>
  <text start="517.279" dur="4.68">see that everything else behind the</text>
  <text start="519.529" dur="5.37">scenes is pretty much exactly the same</text>
  <text start="521.959" dur="5.011">or worse off then when Obama was</text>
  <text start="524.899" dur="5.94">president but again Trump has the</text>
  <text start="526.97" dur="6.09">ability to manipulate the statistical</text>
  <text start="530.839" dur="5.55">numbers that everyone sees now remember</text>
  <text start="533.06" dur="4.889">the deep state the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="536.389" dur="2.76">use these statistical numbers to</text>
  <text start="537.949" dur="3.45">convince the American people that</text>
  <text start="539.149" dur="4.021">everything was great stock market GDP</text>
  <text start="541.399" dur="5.461">unemployment we know all the statistical</text>
  <text start="543.17" dur="7.05">numbers and all the economists and the</text>
  <text start="546.86" dur="5.969">mainstream media they believed that the</text>
  <text start="550.22" dur="5.669">fourth-quarter GDP was gonna come out</text>
  <text start="552.829" dur="5.13">much lower than it actually did now they</text>
  <text start="555.889" dur="5.851">were expecting it to be around 2.2</text>
  <text start="557.959" dur="6.721">percent and it came in around 2.6</text>
  <text start="561.74" dur="4.17">percent on a year-over-year basis 2018</text>
  <text start="564.68" dur="5.49">GDP rose three point</text>
  <text start="565.91" dur="8.25">1% the highest since 2005 and if we go</text>
  <text start="570.17" dur="6.99">back in time we can see that during</text>
  <text start="574.16" dur="6.15">Obama&amp;#39;s reign during the same exact</text>
  <text start="577.16" dur="5.94">period the fourth quarter we can take a</text>
  <text start="580.31" dur="4.59">look at how he did and when the news is</text>
  <text start="583.1" dur="3.63">out there saying oh this is terrible</text>
  <text start="584.9" dur="3.09">this is not good it only came in to 2.6</text>
  <text start="586.73" dur="3.06">percent they were expecting three point</text>
  <text start="587.99" dur="3.36">four and then because of the shutdown</text>
  <text start="589.79" dur="3.24">and everything else we&amp;#39;re expecting two</text>
  <text start="591.35" dur="3.57">point two and only it came in at two</text>
  <text start="593.03" dur="5.1">point six it&amp;#39;s really not a big deal but</text>
  <text start="594.92" dur="7.4">if you go back to 2015 the GDP number</text>
  <text start="598.13" dur="7.71">there was point five if you go back to</text>
  <text start="602.32" dur="7.3">2014 you can see it just barely made two</text>
  <text start="605.84" dur="6.48">percent and you have to remember the</text>
  <text start="609.62" dur="6.48">government was shut down there were</text>
  <text start="612.32" dur="7.41">problems here and still Trump was able</text>
  <text start="616.1" dur="6.3">to beat the expectations why because he</text>
  <text start="619.73" dur="5.49">has the magic wand that&amp;#39;s why so we know</text>
  <text start="622.4" dur="4.2">the China trade deals they are moving</text>
  <text start="625.22" dur="3.6">forward right now and there are many</text>

  <text start="959.97" dur="5.579">get rid of it but the last time the u.s.</text>
  <text start="963.839" dur="2.651">completely paid off the national debt</text>
  <text start="965.549" dur="3.341">was an 18</text>

  <text start="985.48" dur="5.4">amounting to a cumulative net deficit of</text>
  <text start="987.97" dur="5.309">fourteen point two trillion all of the</text>
  <text start="990.88" dur="6.12">surpluses combined in the last 179 years</text>
  <text start="993.279" dur="6.81">amount to 580 billion less than the</text>
  <text start="997" dur="7.83">deficit in 2017 alone which was 665</text>
  <text start="1000.089" dur="8.25">billion since the national debt was last</text>
  <text start="1004.83" dur="6.509">eliminated in 1840 the u.s. paid a</text>
  <text start="1008.339" dur="5.461">cumulative seven point eight trillion of</text>
  <text start="1011.339" dur="4.411">interest on the national debt</text>
  <text start="1013.8" dur="5.19">this interest includes repaying</text>
  <text start="1015.75" dur="5.55">principle simple arithmetic reveals that</text>
  <text start="1018.99" dur="4.86">55 percent the fourteen point two</text>
  <text start="1021.3" dur="5.7">trillion in deficit spending since 1840</text>
  <text start="1023.85" dur="6.06">has in effect gone towards servicing the</text>
  <text start="1027" dur="5.04">national debt put differently instead of</text>
  <text start="1029.91" dur="4.11">paying down its debt with tax revenue</text>
  <text start="1032.04" dur="4.98">the federal government has essentially</text>
  <text start="1034.02" dur="5.819">rolled over 55 percent of its debt since</text>
  <text start="1037.02" dur="4.799">1840 with new debt the result is that</text>
  <text start="1039.839" dur="4.771">despite running only four point two</text>
  <text start="1041.819" dur="5.281">trillion in deficit over the last 179</text>

  <text start="1047.1" dur="5.16">all debt issued more than 30 years ago</text>
  <text start="1048.99" dur="6.09">the national debt today is 21 point 14</text>
  <text start="1052.26" dur="5.22">the difference seven point two trillion</text>
  <text start="1055.08" dur="5.34">represents the cumulative interest the</text>
  <text start="1057.48" dur="6.15">u.s. has paid to fund its deficit - its</text>
  <text start="1060.42" dur="6.03">modest surpluses as a result a full 30</text>
  <text start="1063.63" dur="5.61">percent 36 percent of today&amp;#39;s national</text>
  <text start="1066.45" dur="5.64">debt is in effect the interest paid on</text>
  <text start="1069.24" dur="5.97">past debt only forty-five percent of the</text>
  <text start="1072.09" dur="7.02">national debt went to spending on actual</text>
  <text start="1075.21" dur="6.48">programs the rest went to servicing the</text>
  <text start="1079.11" dur="5.61">national debt itself and to rolling the</text>
  <text start="1081.69" dur="4.83">debt over with new debt it also means</text>
  <text start="1084.72" dur="3.63">that the government has been caring for</text>
  <text start="1086.52" dur="5.01">the majority of the national debt going</text>
  <text start="1088.35" dur="5.94">all the way back to 1840 by paying it</text>
  <text start="1091.53" dur="4.59">off with new debt a portion of the money</text>
  <text start="1094.29" dur="5.86">of the government borrowed in 1841 is</text>
  <text start="1096.12" dur="7.6">still being paid so if you look at this</text>
  <text start="1100.15" dur="7.35">you can see that 45% of the national</text>
  <text start="1103.72" dur="9.78">debt went to spending on the actual</text>
  <text start="1107.5" dur="8.31">programs only 45% think about how bad</text>
  <text start="1113.5" dur="7.74">this is as the debt continually grows</text>
  <text start="1115.81" dur="8.64">and grows and grows soon people will not</text>
  <text start="1121.24" dur="7.59">be able to support this debt soon this</text>
  <text start="1124.45" dur="9.14">debt will overtake everything and if the</text>
  <text start="1128.83" dur="8.64">interest rates ever inch up this is a</text>
  <text start="1133.59" dur="6.88">complete and utter disaster and this is</text>
  <text start="1137.47" dur="6.99">why the Patriots will be bringing down</text>
  <text start="1140.47" dur="5.24">the central bank system there is no</text>
  <text start="1144.46" dur="4.56">choice</text>
  <text start="1145.71" dur="4.6">we don&amp;#39;t want it reset and let and allow</text>
  <text start="1149.02" dur="3.3">the central banks to do this all over</text>
  <text start="1150.31" dur="6.84">again this is what they really wanted to</text>
  <text start="1152.32" dur="7.77">do it has to be removed it has to be</text>
  <text start="1157.15" dur="6.63">taken down it has to be restructured and</text>
  <text start="1160.09" dur="6.39">a sound money system needs to be put in</text>
  <text start="1163.78" dur="5.04">the place of the private West a central</text>

  <text start="1179.8" dur="4.71">a lot of what we know today will</text>

  <text start="1201.22" dur="4.47">this has happened before no that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1203.14" dur="4.74">because the central bankers came into</text>
