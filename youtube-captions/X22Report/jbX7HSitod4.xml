  <text start="50.03" dur="5.16">economic collapse financial news now on</text>
  <text start="52.58" dur="5.04">Friday we saw the market was down it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="55.19" dur="3.96">down today once again the high-frequency</text>
  <text start="57.62" dur="3.09">traders the plunge Protection Team</text>
  <text start="59.15" dur="5.01">worked as hard as they possibly could to</text>
  <text start="60.71" dur="6.45">get the market up to what 178 points or</text>
  <text start="64.16" dur="5.4">so but what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the job</text>
  <text start="67.16" dur="4.08">numbers came out on Friday and I guess</text>
  <text start="69.56" dur="3.63">good news really doesn&amp;#39;t help because</text>
  <text start="71.24" dur="3.45">you know they told the world that the</text>
  <text start="73.19" dur="3.36">unemployment rate is down to four point</text>
  <text start="74.69" dur="3.99">nine percent but that really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="76.55" dur="4.53">matter at this point and we have a look</text>
  <text start="78.68" dur="5.52">at this job report and say does this</text>
  <text start="81.08" dur="6.09">really make any sense I mean according</text>

  <text start="87.17" dur="5.97">fifty one thousand new jobs they were</text>
  <text start="89.93" dur="5.46">created but where are these jobs</text>
  <text start="93.14" dur="6.89">according to the report 69 percent of</text>
  <text start="95.39" dur="7.89">the new jobs are accounted for by retail</text>
  <text start="100.03" dur="7.99">waitresses and bartenders and if we add</text>
  <text start="103.28" dur="8.07">health and social services into this we</text>
  <text start="108.02" dur="6.48">see all the jobs are accounted for this</text>
  <text start="111.35" dur="8.73">is not the employment picture of a first</text>
  <text start="114.5" dur="7.38">world economy in January they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="120.08" dur="4.76">to tell us that the retail sector added</text>
  <text start="121.88" dur="7.68">fifty seven thousand seven hundred jobs</text>
  <text start="124.84" dur="5.83">really the holiday season was a complete</text>
  <text start="129.56" dur="5.64">and utter disaster</text>
  <text start="130.67" dur="5.76">we see all these retail outlets telling</text>
  <text start="135.2" dur="5.28">us they&amp;#39;re going to be closing their</text>
  <text start="136.43" dur="7.85">stores laying off people but retail took</text>
  <text start="140.48" dur="3.8">on fifty seven thousand seven hundred</text>
  <text start="147.099" dur="7">so where did they really add them did</text>
  <text start="150.23" dur="6.6">they just make this up such a large</text>
  <text start="154.099" dur="6.48">increase in retail employment suggests</text>
  <text start="156.83" dur="6.81">an expected rise in sales did we see</text>
  <text start="160.579" dur="7.441">that no transportation and warehousing</text>
  <text start="163.64" dur="7.77">20300 jobs and hotel trade added only</text>
  <text start="168.02" dur="7.71">8,000 so where are they getting these</text>
  <text start="171.41" dur="6.09">numbers it seems at this point they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="263.81" dur="7.979">start to pop because that&amp;#39;s what this</text>
  <text start="267.65" dur="6.12">economy is made up of bubbles actually</text>
  <text start="271.789" dur="4.291">it&amp;#39;s a central bank US government</text>

  <text start="293.09" dur="6.16">purchasing the homes in cash and</text>
  <text start="296.82" dur="6.03">the entire system right now is starting</text>
  <text start="299.25" dur="6.92">to crumble and fall apart and as this</text>
  <text start="302.85" dur="7.82">falls apart we&amp;#39;re going to see things</text>
  <text start="306.17" dur="9.3">accelerate we&amp;#39;re going to see industries</text>
  <text start="310.67" dur="6.97">sectors really start to fall apart and</text>

  <text start="320.28" dur="3.57">everything else but what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="322.02" dur="4.08">happening here if you notice they always</text>

  <text start="341.04" dur="3.63">that could possibly use this is what</text>
  <text start="343.08" dur="2.94">they&amp;#39;re doing at this point and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="344.67" dur="5.25">getting ridiculous because no one</text>
  <text start="346.02" dur="5.97">believes it anymore and as we see</text>
  <text start="349.92" dur="6">challenger grain Christmas they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="366.33" dur="8.61">has fallen again I mean we are down</text>
  <text start="369.69" dur="6.6">right now to about 295 points I mean</text>
  <text start="374.94" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;ve never seen anything like this</text>
  <text start="376.29" dur="4.98">before global trade has come to a</text>
  <text start="379.41" dur="5.99">screeching halt it&amp;#39;s at a standstill at</text>
  <text start="381.27" dur="7.89">this point the u.s. is not manufacturing</text>
  <text start="385.4" dur="7.29">the u.s. is not purchasing the u.s.</text>
  <text start="389.16" dur="7.28">because of the GMO foods</text>
  <text start="392.69" dur="5.59">we&amp;#39;re not exporting like we used to</text>
  <text start="396.44" dur="4.45">countries are saying you know something</text>
  <text start="398.28" dur="4.85">we rather not have that type of food in</text>
  <text start="400.89" dur="5.16">our country so we&amp;#39;re going to ban it and</text>
  <text start="403.13" dur="6.76">what&amp;#39;s happening now is other countries</text>
  <text start="406.05" dur="9.03">like Russia they are going to become the</text>
  <text start="409.89" dur="8.16">largest wheat exporter in 2016 wheat</text>

  <text start="420.78" dur="7.8">biggest wheat exporters of Canada and</text>
  <text start="422.55" dur="7.77">the US I mean think about this what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="428.58" dur="5.86">happening right now</text>
  <text start="430.32" dur="7.9">the u.s. is being stripped of everything</text>
  <text start="434.44" dur="9">right now the US wheat exports are</text>
  <text start="438.22" dur="10.98">projected to fall to a 44 year low to 21</text>
  <text start="443.44" dur="8.16">point 8 million tons Russia their</text>
  <text start="449.2" dur="5.67">exports are going to rise 3 percent to</text>
  <text start="451.6" dur="6.54">twenty three point five million Canada</text>
  <text start="454.87" dur="6.21">their exports are expected to be twenty</text>
  <text start="458.14" dur="7.89">point five million tonnes down from</text>
  <text start="461.08" dur="8.85">twenty four point 1 million tons I mean</text>
  <text start="466.03" dur="9.03">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is horrific</text>
  <text start="469.93" dur="9.42">it&amp;#39;s terrible Venezuela right now their</text>
  <text start="475.06" dur="7.74">entire economy is collapsing we see</text>
  <text start="479.35" dur="4.86">hyperinflation at this point to estimate</text>
  <text start="482.8" dur="5.19">it about a seven hundred and twenty</text>
  <text start="484.21" dur="6.24">percent Venezuela is now literally</text>
  <text start="487.99" dur="7.17">flying in paper-money using three dozen</text>
  <text start="490.45" dur="8.52">cargo Boeing 747s to handle the</text>
  <text start="495.16" dur="7.26">situation and as it collapses it looks</text>
  <text start="498.97" dur="7.23">like Venezuela is going to liquidate the</text>
  <text start="502.42" dur="6.06">nation&amp;#39;s 12 billion in gold reserves to</text>
  <text start="506.2" dur="5.88">try to save the economy and this is</text>
  <text start="508.48" dur="6.36">going to spread to other countries we</text>
  <text start="512.08" dur="7.32">are going to see hyperinflation all over</text>
  <text start="514.84" dur="6.48">the place when this economy starts to</text>
  <text start="519.4" dur="3.77">heat up and things start to move along</text>
  <text start="521.32" dur="3.9">and accelerate like we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="523.17" dur="3.13">eventually the Fed is going to say okay</text>
  <text start="525.22" dur="4.02">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to print money once</text>
  <text start="526.3" dur="4.5">again and what&amp;#39;s going to happen right</text>
  <text start="529.24" dur="4.02">now is the rest of the world is gonna</text>
  <text start="530.8" dur="3.96">say okay you did QE one two three</text>
  <text start="533.26" dur="4.29">now you&amp;#39;re on four five six seven</text>
  <text start="534.76" dur="5.16">whatever it is and it didn&amp;#39;t help before</text>
  <text start="537.55" dur="4.89">it brought you to this point and the</text>
  <text start="539.92" dur="4.7">economy never improved we&amp;#39;re noticing</text>
  <text start="542.44" dur="6.83">that the numbers are all manipulated now</text>
  <text start="544.62" dur="8.01">we&amp;#39;re losing all respect for the Fed</text>
  <text start="549.27" dur="6.28">we&amp;#39;re losing respect for the dollar</text>
  <text start="552.63" dur="6.37">we&amp;#39;re not going to deal in it anymore</text>
  <text start="555.55" dur="5.52">and this is when things really start to</text>
  <text start="559" dur="5.3">fall apart and this is what we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="561.07" dur="7.23">to see the eurozone right now</text>
  <text start="564.3" dur="6.42">it is falling apart just like the us</text>
  <text start="568.3" dur="7.23">just like Canada just like Australia and</text>
  <text start="570.72" dur="6.85">we see already the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="575.53" dur="5.16">want more power over the European</text>
  <text start="577.57" dur="5.22">nations and France and Germany right now</text>
  <text start="580.69" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re out there saying the eurozone</text>
  <text start="582.79" dur="6">needs structural reform and closer</text>
  <text start="585.55" dur="8.22">financial integration they want to</text>
  <text start="588.79" dur="6.93">create a joint finance ministry and this</text>
  <text start="593.77" dur="5.16">is coming from the heads of German and</text>
  <text start="595.72" dur="5.49">French central bank&amp;#39;s the European</text>
  <text start="598.93" dur="4.14">Central Bank the ECB is not in a</text>
  <text start="601.21" dur="6.42">position to create sustainable long-term</text>
  <text start="603.07" dur="7.53">growth for the 19 nations they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="607.63" dur="5.31">they need a common finance ministry with</text>
  <text start="610.6" dur="4.05">an independent fiscal council basically</text>
  <text start="612.94" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re going to make all the decisions</text>
  <text start="614.65" dur="5.49">for all the countries and take away</text>
  <text start="616.84" dur="6.45">their sovereignty and they will decide</text>
  <text start="620.14" dur="8.49">what is going to happen inside on the</text>
  <text start="623.29" dur="8.01">micro level of the countries so what</text>
  <text start="628.63" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is everyone is</text>
  <text start="631.3" dur="4.95">becoming desperate the central bankers</text>
  <text start="633.46" dur="4.26">are trying to take more control they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="636.25" dur="5.07">trying to spread to debt even further</text>
  <text start="637.72" dur="5.79">and we can see at this point it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="641.32" dur="6.45">getting worse now the u.s. system is</text>
  <text start="643.51" dur="6.3">based on the petro dollar and the u.s.</text>
  <text start="647.77" dur="4.05">dollar is the reserve currency and we</text>
  <text start="649.81" dur="5.97">see countries like you know Yemen Libya</text>
  <text start="651.82" dur="5.46">Lebanon Iraq they were all dealing with</text>
  <text start="655.78" dur="3.24">the petro dollar who ever wanted to</text>
  <text start="657.28" dur="3.87">purchase the oil they had to use the</text>
  <text start="659.02" dur="3.18">petro dollar and we see in these</text>
  <text start="661.15" dur="2.61">countries a lot of these countries</text>
  <text start="662.2" dur="5.07">didn&amp;#39;t want to use the petro dollar and</text>
  <text start="663.76" dur="7.8">the people started to rise up and what</text>
  <text start="667.27" dur="8.64">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that there is a huge</text>
  <text start="671.56" dur="6.93">push to move away from the dollar now</text>
  <text start="675.91" dur="4.14">they made the p5 plus 1 deal with Iran</text>
  <text start="678.49" dur="3.84">and Naik I said and it has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="680.05" dur="5.58">with nuclear had nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="682.33" dur="5.88">nuclear weapons they use this as the</text>
  <text start="685.63" dur="4.83">front but behind the scenes it was about</text>
  <text start="688.21" dur="5.73">the Central Bank of Iran it was about</text>
  <text start="690.46" dur="5.5">using their natural resources placing</text>
  <text start="693.94" dur="3.76">that on the dollar</text>
  <text start="695.96" dur="3.99">and we&amp;#39;re getting information from Iran</text>
  <text start="697.7" dur="5.16">already saying we&amp;#39;re not even going to</text>
  <text start="699.95" dur="4.98">use the dollar at this point I mean</text>
  <text start="702.86" dur="6.93">they&amp;#39;re gonna ramp up crude production</text>
  <text start="704.93" dur="9.15">by some by some 500,000 barrels per day</text>
  <text start="709.79" dur="7.47">and by about 1 million barrels per day</text>
  <text start="714.08" dur="5.61">by the end of the year as the</text>
  <text start="717.26" dur="5.49">international sanctions have been lifted</text>
  <text start="719.69" dur="7.05">and what they&amp;#39;re trying to do right now</text>
  <text start="722.75" dur="8.49">is tell the world we at this point are</text>
  <text start="726.74" dur="8.82">not going to use the dollar you do not</text>
  <text start="731.24" dur="7.59">have to use the dollar to pay for oil we</text>
  <text start="735.56" dur="5.13">rather use euros and eventually what</text>
  <text start="738.83" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;ll do is they&amp;#39;ll move away from</text>
  <text start="740.69" dur="6.03">euros very slowly move into rubles or</text>
  <text start="743.87" dur="5.34">you want but this is the first step so</text>
  <text start="746.72" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re bypassing the dollar completely</text>
  <text start="749.21" dur="5.67">and the United States government central</text>
  <text start="752.27" dur="7.56">bankers this was their whole plan their</text>
  <text start="754.88" dur="7.71">plan was to have Iran and they wanted</text>
  <text start="759.83" dur="6.57">them to use the dollar to keep this</text>
  <text start="762.59" dur="5.82">system propped up and already they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="766.4" dur="5.76">telling the United States we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="768.41" dur="6.15">doing this they&amp;#39;re saying that switching</text>
  <text start="772.16" dur="4.56">oil sales to Euros makes sense as Europe</text>
  <text start="774.56" dur="4.62">is now one of Iran&amp;#39;s biggest trading</text>
  <text start="776.72" dur="5.1">partners and we will have to watch and</text>
  <text start="779.18" dur="5.7">see how the US government central</text>
  <text start="781.82" dur="6.6">bankers react to this decision now we</text>
  <text start="784.88" dur="6.41">are seeing a record number of US</text>
  <text start="788.42" dur="6.75">citizens renounce their citizenship in</text>
  <text start="791.29" dur="6.7">2015 and the number is continually</text>
  <text start="795.17" dur="5.25">growing the latest US Treasury report</text>
  <text start="797.99" dur="4.23">says there is a record four thousand two</text>
  <text start="800.42" dur="3.6">hundred seventy nine individuals that</text>
  <text start="802.22" dur="6.33">decided to give up their citizenship in</text>
  <text start="804.02" dur="6.48">2015 and that is up by 864 from the</text>
  <text start="808.55" dur="3.48">previous full year which was around</text>
  <text start="810.5" dur="3.2">three thousand four hundred and fifteen</text>
  <text start="812.03" dur="5.31">and when they asked them the question</text>
  <text start="813.7" dur="6.16">what was the main reason for this and it</text>
  <text start="817.34" dur="5.55">was the foreign account Tax Compliance</text>
  <text start="819.86" dur="6.21">Act which was vodka which came into</text>
  <text start="822.89" dur="5.82">force in 2010 and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="826.07" dur="3.66">you know we cannot handle paying all of</text>
  <text start="828.71" dur="4.919">these taxes</text>
  <text start="829.73" dur="8.159">so we had to renounce our citizenship we</text>
  <text start="833.629" dur="9.48">see Obama very interestingly is asking</text>
  <text start="837.889" dur="10.17">Congress for 1.8 billion dollars for the</text>
  <text start="843.109" dur="7.02">Zika virus and he&amp;#39;s saying that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="848.059" dur="6.33">needed for funding for a research</text>
  <text start="850.129" dur="6.15">testing and public health the money will</text>
  <text start="854.389" dur="4.5">include funds for expanding mosquito</text>
  <text start="856.279" dur="6.66">control as well as speeding up research</text>
  <text start="858.889" dur="9.45">and testing yes you heard it for</text>
  <text start="862.939" dur="9.24">scenes and new diagnostics and we can</text>
  <text start="868.339" dur="6.69">see at this point that he&amp;#39;s going to use</text>
  <text start="872.179" dur="6.481">the money for other reasons and most</text>
  <text start="875.029" dur="5.49">likely will probably see US troops go</text>
  <text start="878.66" dur="5.369">into those countries that have these</text>
  <text start="880.519" dur="5.641">outbreaks because we always see the u.s.</text>
  <text start="884.029" dur="4.441">move into these countries that they need</text>
  <text start="886.16" dur="5.699">to get into just like when Ebola first</text>
  <text start="888.47" dur="6.389">happened we saw troops go into Liberia</text>
  <text start="891.859" dur="6.361">and many of the other countries in</text>
  <text start="894.859" dur="5.01">Africa and the troops never left we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="898.22" dur="5.13">going to see the same thing happen in</text>
  <text start="899.869" dur="6.06">South America as we know the US has been</text>
  <text start="903.35" dur="5.669">trying to overthrow governments in South</text>
  <text start="905.929" dur="5.671">America because they want the oil and</text>
  <text start="909.019" dur="6.48">we&amp;#39;re going to see the same thing occur</text>
  <text start="911.6" dur="8.009">once again because as we know the the</text>
  <text start="915.499" dur="5.58">entire economy is collapsing and the US</text>
  <text start="919.609" dur="4.08">government central bankers they are</text>
  <text start="921.079" dur="5.85">becoming desperate and they need to prop</text>
  <text start="923.689" dur="7.08">up this system and they&amp;#39;ll do whatever</text>
  <text start="926.929" dur="5.81">they possibly have to to do that I mean</text>
  <text start="930.769" dur="5.81">if it if it&amp;#39;s overthrowing a government</text>
  <text start="932.739" dur="7.15">they will do that if it&amp;#39;s creating a new</text>
  <text start="936.579" dur="6.88">virus they will do that they will push</text>
  <text start="939.889" dur="6.66">the agenda to keep the system alive a</text>
  <text start="943.459" dur="5.94">little bit longer because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="946.549" dur="5.88">want it coming down by itself they want</text>
  <text start="949.399" dur="5.52">to control it when the whole thing does</text>
  <text start="952.429" dur="5.01">crash and everyone thanks a lot for</text>
