  <text start="106.57" dur="7.56">that the economy is doing well and</text>
  <text start="111.509" dur="6.22">they&amp;#39;re going to do this up until the</text>

  <text start="193.719" dur="5.55">steering the ship yes the president can</text>
  <text start="197.469" dur="3.66">do a couple of things but one of the</text>
  <text start="199.269" dur="4.05">main things that they the president</text>
  <text start="201.129" dur="4.83">needs to do is they need to get rid of</text>
  <text start="203.319" dur="5.45">the central bank and take control of the</text>
  <text start="205.959" dur="6.65">entire system the creation of currency</text>
  <text start="208.769" dur="8.231">the control back to the people and</text>

  <text start="219.909" dur="6.151">up with is the same exact thing we see</text>
  <text start="223.359" dur="7.141">that gold is up for five days in a row</text>
  <text start="226.06" dur="6.87">and is surging above 1150 today well if</text>
  <text start="230.5" dur="5.79">someone decided to buy about 3.5 billion</text>
  <text start="232.93" dur="6.209">notional paper contracts a precious</text>
  <text start="236.29" dur="6.86">metal and they did this into the</text>
  <text start="239.139" dur="6.3">European clothes which brought gold up</text>
  <text start="243.15" dur="4.54">maybe someone is out there looking at</text>

  <text start="261.459" dur="6.21">prices now are dropping in many areas we</text>
  <text start="264.159" dur="5.851">see traffic to these houses well that is</text>

  <text start="274.93" dur="5.43">interest rates rising we see auto</text>
  <text start="277.659" dur="5.611">financing practices well they begin to</text>
  <text start="280.36" dur="6.239">resemble the subprime mortgage bubble</text>
  <text start="283.27" dur="4.98">and those individuals that were able to</text>
  <text start="286.599" dur="4.051">get loans well it&amp;#39;s getting a little bit</text>
  <text start="288.25" dur="6.57">tougher to get it and we see right now</text>
  <text start="290.65" dur="9.299">that buyers are saying you know maybe</text>
  <text start="294.82" dur="9.029">I&amp;#39;ll hold off right now and the optimism</text>
  <text start="299.949" dur="5.97">of purchasing all of these things well</text>
  <text start="303.849" dur="4.051">it&amp;#39;s evaporating right now with interest</text>
  <text start="305.919" dur="4.22">rates moving up and this is a huge</text>
  <text start="307.9" dur="4.71">problem when interest rates move up</text>
  <text start="310.139" dur="4.75">people say well you know what let me</text>
  <text start="312.61" dur="3.929">wait and if it</text>
  <text start="314.889" dur="4.171">moves up again they say okay I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="316.539" dur="4.59">completely out now when we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="319.06" dur="6.56">the real estate market we definitely do</text>

  <text start="337.689" dur="5.13">square foot places in New York City</text>
  <text start="340.93" dur="7.199">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="342.819" dur="8.511">that contracts for luxury coops they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="348.129" dur="5.28">collapsed twenty five percent in 2016</text>
  <text start="351.33" dur="4.359">while the average number of days that</text>
  <text start="353.409" dur="5.82">the apartments set on the market surged</text>
  <text start="355.689" dur="6.901">by thirty one percent and what does this</text>
  <text start="359.229" dur="7.231">tell us well it tells us that these</text>
  <text start="362.59" dur="5.849">bubbles are starting to burst they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="366.46" dur="5.429">going to come down and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="368.439" dur="6.54">signs of this already and this is going</text>
  <text start="371.889" dur="4.62">to accelerate as we move into 2017 it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="374.979" dur="3.421">going to get worse and worse and worse</text>
  <text start="376.509" dur="5.071">and if you notice and if you go back a</text>
  <text start="378.4" dur="6.419">year when we talked about how prices</text>
  <text start="381.58" dur="5.489">were coming down how the traffic was</text>
  <text start="384.819" dur="4.141">starting to slow back then you really</text>
  <text start="387.069" dur="4.91">couldn&amp;#39;t see it it was a little</text>
  <text start="388.96" dur="6.54">noticeable but as we went through 2016</text>
  <text start="391.979" dur="6.581">we saw signs of it we saw interest rates</text>
  <text start="395.5" dur="5.849">moving up we saw that these bubbles that</text>
  <text start="398.56" dur="5.789">were created in these 20 cities well</text>
  <text start="401.349" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re starting to fall apart and now</text>
  <text start="404.349" dur="4.891">you&amp;#39;re really starting to see it and</text>
  <text start="406.449" dur="6.18">when we move into 2017 it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="409.24" dur="6.38">widespread you won&amp;#39;t be able to deny it</text>
  <text start="412.629" dur="5.97">anymore because you&amp;#39;ll see it everywhere</text>
  <text start="415.62" dur="7.919">we see out in Italy things are a lot</text>
  <text start="418.599" dur="8.91">worse than everyone thought the ECB is</text>
  <text start="423.539" dur="6.071">telling the Italian banks that they owe</text>
  <text start="427.509" dur="6.421">a lot more than just the five billion</text>
  <text start="429.61" dur="6.329">they owe 8.8 billion in euros because</text>
  <text start="433.93" dur="6.419">what they&amp;#39;re seeing they&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="435.939" dur="7.38">bank run and it&amp;#39;s accelerating deposits</text>
  <text start="440.349" dur="4.44">are leaving the bank and of course the</text>
  <text start="443.319" dur="5.13">reason for this is because people in</text>
  <text start="444.789" dur="6.62">Italy realize we&amp;#39;re in trouble here</text>
  <text start="448.449" dur="6.27">and we see right now that most likely</text>
  <text start="451.409" dur="5.801">very high probability that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="454.719" dur="4.32">to do bail-ins in italy you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="457.21" dur="3.959">see balance in Germany you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="459.039" dur="5.99">see balance and France all throughout</text>
  <text start="461.169" dur="9.18">Europe because what do they have left</text>
  <text start="465.029" dur="8.741">not much so as we come to the close of</text>
  <text start="470.349" dur="7.5">2016 we see that the central bankers</text>
  <text start="473.77" dur="8.489">they have set up the economy to</text>
  <text start="477.849" dur="7.951">completely implode on itself without</text>
  <text start="482.259" dur="7.08">them being blamed because what they did</text>
  <text start="485.8" dur="7.44">was they created the atmosphere that the</text>
  <text start="489.339" dur="6.6">economy is improving the economy has</text>
  <text start="493.24" dur="5.849">recovered and the statistical</text>
  <text start="495.939" dur="5.25">information is incredible and people are</text>
  <text start="499.089" dur="4.651">looking at this and they&amp;#39;re saying to</text>
  <text start="501.189" dur="4.171">themselves yeah maybe they are right</text>
  <text start="503.74" dur="4.38">maybe the economy is doing a lot better</text>
  <text start="505.36" dur="5.669">look at the stock market it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="508.12" dur="6.149">approaching 20,000 look at the</text>
  <text start="511.029" dur="7.471">unemployment it&amp;#39;s very low look at GDP</text>
  <text start="514.269" dur="8.55">it&amp;#39;s skyrocketing and we see right now</text>
  <text start="518.5" dur="8.3">that they have completely set this up so</text>
  <text start="522.819" dur="9.061">they can usher in the economic reset and</text>
  <text start="526.8" dur="9.19">this reset is the crash of the economy</text>
  <text start="531.88" dur="8.91">it&amp;#39;s a reset of everything getting rid</text>
  <text start="535.99" dur="9.26">of this fiat currency getting rid of the</text>
  <text start="540.79" dur="8.989">dollar moving into a different currency</text>
  <text start="545.25" dur="8.26">system now will it be backed by gold</text>
  <text start="549.779" dur="5.471">well we don&amp;#39;t know as of yet many people</text>
  <text start="553.51" dur="4.65">say yes it&amp;#39;s going to be backed by gold</text>
  <text start="555.25" dur="5.209">but what we do know is that the dollar</text>
  <text start="558.16" dur="4.95">continually loses its purchasing power</text>
  <text start="560.459" dur="3.911">the dollar is going to be worth nothing</text>
  <text start="563.11" dur="4.529">it&amp;#39;s going to be a piece of paper with</text>
  <text start="564.37" dur="5.19">ink and that is it and as we move away</text>
  <text start="567.639" dur="6">from the dollar because as we know the</text>
  <text start="569.56" dur="6.899">petro dollar it&amp;#39;s doomed the system is</text>
  <text start="573.639" dur="5.401">done with they know it they set it up</text>
  <text start="576.459" dur="5.791">they knew that this time would come and</text>
  <text start="579.04" dur="6.62">here we are right now and</text>
  <text start="582.25" dur="6">are preparing to do this major switch</text>
  <text start="585.66" dur="4.06">now it would be nice if we could do the</text>
  <text start="588.25" dur="3.6">switch without the central bank that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="589.72" dur="4.71">what we really want where we can take</text>
  <text start="591.85" dur="6.78">control of creating the currency the</text>
  <text start="594.43" dur="6.75">people have control of the economics of</text>
  <text start="598.63" dur="3.57">the United States but the central</text>
  <text start="601.18" dur="3">bankers are not just going to give up</text>
  <text start="602.2" dur="6">control they&amp;#39;re going to fight to the</text>
  <text start="604.18" dur="6.08">very end they want this entire reset so</text>
  <text start="608.2" dur="4.67">they can be in control once again and</text>
  <text start="610.26" dur="5.11">started from scratch that&amp;#39;s their plan</text>
  <text start="612.87" dur="3.82">they don&amp;#39;t want to give up anything they</text>
  <text start="615.37" dur="6.03">just can&amp;#39;t they just want to get rid of</text>
  <text start="616.69" dur="8.76">this dollar and this debt but they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="621.4" dur="6.48">want to be blamed for this entire fiasco</text>
  <text start="625.45" dur="4.68">they want to shift this blame someplace</text>
  <text start="627.88" dur="6.03">else and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re in process</text>
  <text start="630.13" dur="7.38">of doing they&amp;#39;re getting prepared to</text>
  <text start="633.91" dur="7.47">shift this blame somewhere else they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="637.51" dur="6.45">pushing as hard as they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="641.38" dur="5.13">create the atmosphere of an incredible</text>
  <text start="643.96" dur="6.84">economy so they can bring it down and</text>
  <text start="646.51" dur="7.14">blame either Trump Russia North Korea</text>
  <text start="650.8" dur="7.35">China it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter as long</text>
  <text start="653.65" dur="9.93">as they&amp;#39;re not blamed and we can see as</text>
  <text start="658.15" dur="8.45">we approach the end of 2016 2017 most</text>
  <text start="663.58" dur="6.09">likely will be the year of the reset and</text>
  <text start="666.6" dur="6.04">it&amp;#39;s going to be a very rough year</text>
  <text start="669.67" dur="6.62">because we&amp;#39;re going to see all the</text>
