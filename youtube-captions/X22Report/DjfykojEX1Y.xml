  <text start="112.45" dur="4.529">be coming into some type of correction</text>
  <text start="114.849" dur="4.83">now when we look around and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="116.979" dur="4.53">looking at all this data we can see that</text>
  <text start="119.679" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;re in big trouble right now I mean</text>
  <text start="121.509" dur="6.51">we&amp;#39;ve looked at everything and it is one</text>
  <text start="124.929" dur="5.67">gigantic illusion after another illusion</text>
  <text start="128.019" dur="4.681">to cover up what&amp;#39;s really going on and</text>
  <text start="130.599" dur="3.481">then we have you know the conference</text>
  <text start="132.7" dur="3.63">board telling us that consumer</text>
  <text start="134.08" dur="4.53">confidence is very high we have the Yuma</text>
  <text start="136.33" dur="5.879">just came out today and it is reporting</text>
  <text start="138.61" dur="7.349">that there is uncertainty in the air and</text>
  <text start="142.209" dur="6.901">we can see right now that things are</text>
  <text start="145.959" dur="5.31">rapidly deteriorating and when we look</text>
  <text start="149.11" dur="4.53">at the image we see that expectations</text>
  <text start="151.269" dur="5.701">for higher incomes well that is declined</text>
  <text start="153.64" dur="6.45">and the timing for buying a home buying</text>
  <text start="156.97" dur="5.73">a car or major appliances well that also</text>
  <text start="160.09" dur="6.24">has declined people are starting to wake</text>
  <text start="162.7" dur="7.5">up and realize there&amp;#39;s a problem now</text>
  <text start="166.33" dur="5.82">when this system collapses and it&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="170.2" dur="4.11">its way we&amp;#39;re I believe we&amp;#39;re already in</text>
  <text start="172.15" dur="4.349">a recession I&amp;#39;ve seen so many economic</text>
  <text start="174.31" dur="5.189">indicators that we&amp;#39;ve reported on that</text>
  <text start="176.499" dur="4.521">we all now see that there&amp;#39;s a major</text>
  <text start="179.499" dur="4.071">problem in</text>
  <text start="181.02" dur="5.85">recovery in an economy that&amp;#39;s strong do</text>
  <text start="183.57" dur="5.43">you really see this many employees in</text>
  <text start="186.87" dur="4.38">retail being laid off do you see really</text>
  <text start="189" dur="4.59">this many stores closing and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="191.25" dur="4.65">already proven that it&amp;#39;s not online</text>
  <text start="193.59" dur="5.16">sales because that&amp;#39;s only one-tenth of</text>
  <text start="195.9" dur="5.1">the retail market I know they throw out</text>
  <text start="198.75" dur="4.47">numbers like oh 3 billion worth of</text>
  <text start="201" dur="4.8">retail sales but you need to put that</text>
  <text start="203.22" dur="3.99">into perspective and that&amp;#39;s just a small</text>
  <text start="205.8" dur="3.48">little portion of it that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="207.21" dur="5.37">online and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="209.28" dur="5.37">is things are really looking bad now</text>
  <text start="212.58" dur="4.2">when this market comes down and that is</text>
  <text start="214.65" dur="4.11">going to be the red flare that shoots up</text>
  <text start="216.78" dur="4.92">into the sky that lets everyone know</text>
  <text start="218.76" dur="4.11">that the economy is in trouble and</text>
  <text start="221.7" dur="3.03">everyone&amp;#39;s going to be scratching their</text>
  <text start="222.87" dur="3.69">head going how did this happen it came</text>
  <text start="224.73" dur="4.11">out of nowhere well it really didn&amp;#39;t and</text>
  <text start="226.56" dur="4.08">we can see right now that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="228.84" dur="3.21">talking about this that the pension</text>
  <text start="230.64" dur="3.69">funds they&amp;#39;re going to be in a lot of</text>
  <text start="232.05" dur="5.31">trouble and this is going to spread</text>
  <text start="234.33" dur="5.54">across the country and it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="237.36" dur="5.46">myself saying it it&amp;#39;s not just other</text>
  <text start="239.87" dur="6.28">alternative site saying it we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="242.82" dur="5.82">hearing it from Bloomberg and once these</text>
  <text start="246.15" dur="5.52">type of news organizations pick up on it</text>
  <text start="248.64" dur="5.34">well the issue has gotten so big they</text>
  <text start="251.67" dur="4.35">can&amp;#39;t ignore it anymore and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="253.98" dur="4.92">seeing right now is that we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="256.02" dur="5.91">into this pension crisis which is going</text>
  <text start="258.9" dur="5.76">to be too big for markets to ignore and</text>
  <text start="261.93" dur="4.86">we mentioned the old Dallas we mentioned</text>
  <text start="264.66" dur="4.05">South Carolina we mentioned all these</text>
  <text start="266.79" dur="3.96">different areas where pensions well</text>
  <text start="268.71" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re starting to implode on</text>
  <text start="270.75" dur="6.03">themselves they&amp;#39;re underfunded and they</text>
  <text start="273.51" dur="5.82">just will not be able to pay out when</text>
  <text start="276.78" dur="5.94">everything starts to fall apart now the</text>
  <text start="279.33" dur="5.16">truth is is that pension plan not just</text>
  <text start="282.72" dur="3.78">in dallas in South Carolina and these</text>
  <text start="284.49" dur="4.679">small little areas pension plans all</text>
  <text start="286.5" dur="5.16">over the country are severely</text>
  <text start="289.169" dur="5.341">underfunded and this has already</text>
  <text start="291.66" dur="4.8">resulted in local Fiasco&amp;#39;s like we</text>
  <text start="294.51" dur="5.48">talked about dallas south carolina and</text>
  <text start="296.46" dur="6.18">many of areas now according to bloomberg</text>
  <text start="299.99" dur="6.3">unfunded pension obligations on a</text>
  <text start="302.64" dur="9.72">national basis have risen to 1.9</text>
  <text start="306.29" dur="7.5">trillion from 292 billion since 2007 I</text>
  <text start="312.36" dur="3.85">mean think about</text>
  <text start="313.79" dur="6.57">for a second here one point nine</text>
  <text start="316.21" dur="6.64">trillion now as was the case with the</text>
  <text start="320.36" dur="5.97">subprime crisis the writing right now</text>
  <text start="322.85" dur="6.48">well it appears to be on the wall and it</text>
  <text start="326.33" dur="4.8">looks like we&amp;#39;re in big trouble and what</text>
  <text start="329.33" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="331.13" dur="6">used these tricky accounting methods and</text>
  <text start="334.31" dur="5.64">they basically hidden a lot of the</text>
  <text start="337.13" dur="4.77">numbers and these unfunded pension</text>
  <text start="339.95" dur="4.11">obligations that have risen to out one</text>
  <text start="341.9" dur="4.95">point nine trillion well one point nine</text>
  <text start="344.06" dur="4.5">trillion number is not actually the real</text>
  <text start="346.85" dur="3.84">number now I know bloomberg is reporting</text>
  <text start="348.56" dur="4.05">on this they&amp;#39;re telling us as one point</text>
  <text start="350.69" dur="3.48">nine and every time they report on</text>
  <text start="352.61" dur="3.96">something like this we know it&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="354.17" dur="5.82">bigger and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="356.57" dur="7.26">is that the article goes on to admit</text>
  <text start="359.99" dur="6.09">that if you use honest math I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="363.83" dur="4.29">know there was honest math and dishonest</text>
  <text start="366.08" dur="4.95">math I thought it was just math I guess</text>
  <text start="368.12" dur="4.77">we&amp;#39;ve come to the point in time where</text>
  <text start="371.03" dur="4.38">there&amp;#39;s two different types of math</text>
  <text start="372.89" dur="5.4">because dishonest math is you know</text>
  <text start="375.41" dur="5.1">criminals trying to hide things I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="378.29" dur="4.11">know governments we&amp;#39;re trying to hide in</text>
  <text start="380.51" dur="3.51">pension plans we&amp;#39;re trying to hide but</text>
  <text start="382.4" dur="3.87">it turns out that I guess all these</text>
  <text start="384.02" dur="5.88">individuals are now criminals because</text>
  <text start="386.27" dur="7.83">the honest math shows the number closer</text>
  <text start="389.9" dur="6.27">to six trillion dollars now we know the</text>
  <text start="394.1" dur="4.95">Fed has the ability to keep the stock</text>
  <text start="396.17" dur="4.47">market up we know that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="399.05" dur="4.02">continually doing this but when things</text>
  <text start="400.64" dur="4.17">start to fall apart when the market</text>
  <text start="403.07" dur="4.44">comes down and as we can see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="404.81" dur="6.3">raising the rates well what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="407.51" dur="6.36">happen the entire pension system it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="411.11" dur="4.68">kind of completely fall apart and a lot</text>
  <text start="413.87" dur="5.88">of people are going to be hurt this time</text>
  <text start="415.79" dur="7.62">I mean 2007 was 292 billion this time</text>
  <text start="419.75" dur="6.42">it&amp;#39;s six trillion it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="423.41" dur="5.22">nightmare for everyone so think about</text>
  <text start="426.17" dur="3.93">this just like in 2008 with the</text>
  <text start="428.63" dur="4.05">derivatives that had been layered into</text>
  <text start="430.1" dur="5.01">the mix the embedded leverage in the</text>
  <text start="432.68" dur="4.68">commercial mortgages is the financial</text>
  <text start="435.11" dur="5.79">equivalent of the fukushima nuclear</text>
  <text start="437.36" dur="6.12">power plant collapse the coming stock</text>
  <text start="440.9" dur="6.06">market crash is going to hit pension</text>
  <text start="443.48" dur="4.08">funds even harder stocks we know are</text>
  <text start="446.96" dur="2.73">ridiculous</text>
  <text start="447.56" dur="4.079">the overvalued right now and if they</text>
  <text start="449.69" dur="4.29">simply return to normal valuations</text>
  <text start="451.639" dur="5.731">pension funds are going to lose</text>
  <text start="453.98" dur="7.22">trillions of dollars we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="457.37" dur="8.07">a financial tsunami that will absolutely</text>
  <text start="461.2" dur="6.43">be unprecedented in our history and all</text>
  <text start="465.44" dur="3.9">these investors they continue to act</text>
  <text start="467.63" dur="5.55">like the party can last forever now</text>
  <text start="469.34" dur="6.329">didn&amp;#39;t this happen during 2008 where all</text>
  <text start="473.18" dur="6.33">these individuals that were trading</text>
  <text start="475.669" dur="6">these subprime securities buying real</text>
  <text start="479.51" dur="3.48">estate they thought the housing market</text>
  <text start="481.669" dur="3.661">who&amp;#39;s going to continue like this</text>
  <text start="482.99" dur="3.39">forever prices were going to go up we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="485.33" dur="2.7">going to make a lot more money we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="486.38" dur="3.33">going to sell these houses it will never</text>
  <text start="488.03" dur="4.35">end why because housing doesn&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="489.71" dur="5.04">down well everything came to a</text>
  <text start="492.38" dur="5.07">screeching halt and it will come to a</text>
  <text start="494.75" dur="4.5">screeching halt once again now we have</text>
  <text start="497.45" dur="4.98">the Atlanta Fed out there once again</text>
  <text start="499.25" dur="5.61">they brought the gdp estimate down 2.9</text>
  <text start="502.43" dur="5.489">percent now today we had a disappointing</text>
  <text start="504.86" dur="6.69">consumer spending data that came out and</text>
  <text start="507.919" dur="7.231">it doesn&amp;#39;t look good so they lowered GDP</text>
  <text start="511.55" dur="5.64">once again two-point-eight percent this</text>
  <text start="515.15" dur="5.04">is not looking good we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot</text>
  <text start="517.19" dur="6.779">of chaos happening in the month of March</text>
  <text start="520.19" dur="7.92">going into April now we can see the</text>
  <text start="523.969" dur="6.601">market it continually moves up and Wall</text>
  <text start="528.11" dur="5.52">Street claims the surge in stocks is</text>
  <text start="530.57" dur="4.89">based on rising corporate earnings we</text>
  <text start="533.63" dur="4.77">know this to be completely fake phony</text>
  <text start="535.46" dur="4.65">and false so let&amp;#39;s say the Commerce</text>
  <text start="538.4" dur="4.71">Department&amp;#39;s Bureau of Economic Analysis</text>
  <text start="540.11" dur="5.82">they released their third estimate of</text>

  <text start="545.93" dur="5.01">profits today the second revision of its</text>
  <text start="548.81" dur="4.59">first estimate of January 27 contains</text>
  <text start="550.94" dur="4.89">more data and is considered a more</text>
  <text start="553.4" dur="5.43">accurate approximation of what happened</text>
  <text start="555.83" dur="6.21">in the vast hard to quantify US economy</text>
  <text start="558.83" dur="5.97">corporate profits despite stock market</text>
  <text start="562.04" dur="6.69">that has been surging for years are even</text>
  <text start="564.8" dur="6.57">worse a lot worse they&amp;#39;ve declined for</text>
  <text start="568.73" dur="4.95">years in fact they decline for years</text>
  <text start="571.37" dur="4.589">during the prior to stock market bubbles</text>
  <text start="573.68" dur="5.09">the dot-com bubble and the pre-financial</text>
  <text start="575.959" dur="5.431">crisis bubble both ended in crashes</text>
  <text start="578.77" dur="4.9">however Wahlstrom anes sign</text>
  <text start="581.39" dur="5.34">Dominus they&amp;#39;re not even saying anything</text>
  <text start="583.67" dur="4.59">about it because I guess if that</text>
  <text start="586.73" dur="3.69">information was out there and it was</text>
  <text start="588.26" dur="4.35">reported on people would be selling</text>
  <text start="590.42" dur="4.68">stocks like crazy so they&amp;#39;re pretending</text>
  <text start="592.61" dur="6">it just doesn&amp;#39;t exist like everything</text>
  <text start="595.1" dur="6.39">else and when we look at the corporate</text>
  <text start="598.61" dur="5.55">profits we can see right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="601.49" dur="5.76">absolutely awful in the fourth quarter</text>
  <text start="604.16" dur="5.64">profit road rose to 2.15 trillion</text>
  <text start="607.25" dur="4.68">seasonally adjusted annual rate that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="609.8" dur="5.34">what the annual profit would be after</text>
  <text start="611.93" dur="5.7">four quarters at this rate but profits</text>
  <text start="615.14" dur="4.95">in the prior prior three quarters were</text>
  <text start="617.63" dur="4.08">lower and so the fourth quarter brought</text>
  <text start="620.09" dur="4.53">the year total to two point zero eight</text>
  <text start="621.71" dur="5.67">five trillion this was down from 2015</text>
  <text start="624.62" dur="6.72">and it was down from 2014 and when we</text>
  <text start="627.38" dur="7.29">look over this period starting at 2013</text>
  <text start="631.34" dur="5.91">or so we see that corporate profits have</text>
  <text start="634.67" dur="5.37">been declining and guess what happened</text>
  <text start="637.25" dur="6.24">during the pre-crisis bubble back in two</text>
  <text start="640.04" dur="7.17">thousand six going into 2007 going into</text>
  <text start="643.49" dur="7.08">2008 corporate profits we&amp;#39;re declining</text>
  <text start="647.21" dur="6.27">very interesting so we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="650.57" dur="5.01">same thing once again so let&amp;#39;s put all</text>
  <text start="653.48" dur="4.92">this into perspective we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="655.58" dur="6.18">corporate profits decline but the stock</text>
  <text start="658.4" dur="6">market is surging I mean think about</text>
  <text start="661.76" dur="4.25">this for a second every time that this</text>
  <text start="664.4" dur="5.04">has happened over the last two times</text>
  <text start="666.01" dur="5.65">well it didn&amp;#39;t end well now we also</text>
  <text start="669.44" dur="5.84">looked at the Fed raising the interest</text>
  <text start="671.66" dur="5.94">rates when we look back to 2006-2007</text>
  <text start="675.28" dur="4.51">they were raising the interest rates</text>
  <text start="677.6" dur="4.47">into an economy that was completely</text>
  <text start="679.79" dur="5">falling apart where the subprime</text>
  <text start="682.07" dur="5.16">securities they were completely garbage</text>
  <text start="684.79" dur="5.35">speculators were purchasing homes the</text>
  <text start="687.23" dur="5.57">market was at 14,000 points very high</text>
  <text start="690.14" dur="5.34">that started the chain reaction and</text>
  <text start="692.8" dur="4.05">everything started to fall apart so when</text>
  <text start="695.48" dur="5.16">they started raising interest rates</text>
  <text start="696.85" dur="7.42">corporate profits in 2006 started to</text>
  <text start="700.64" dur="5.19">decline at that point here we are once</text>
  <text start="704.27" dur="5.31">again where corporate profits have been</text>
  <text start="705.83" dur="6.09">declining since 2014 but the market has</text>
  <text start="709.58" dur="5.44">been continually moving up same thing in</text>
  <text start="711.92" dur="5.65">2006 corporate profits we&amp;#39;re declining</text>
  <text start="715.02" dur="4.95">and the stock market was moving up the</text>
  <text start="717.57" dur="5.67">Fed was raising interest rates from to</text>
  <text start="719.97" dur="5.85">this 2006 on to start the chain reaction</text>
  <text start="723.24" dur="4.89">here we are in 2017 we&amp;#39;re actually in</text>
  <text start="725.82" dur="4.74">2016 where they started raising the</text>
  <text start="728.13" dur="4.92">rates actually going back to 2015 they</text>
  <text start="730.56" dur="4.83">did it once 2016 and then 2017 another</text>
  <text start="733.05" dur="6.09">time they&amp;#39;re already starting the same</text>
  <text start="735.39" dur="6.93">exact pattern so once again we are</text>
  <text start="739.14" dur="6.96">seeing the same information the same</text>
  <text start="742.32" dur="7.17">indicators letting us know that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="746.1" dur="6.75">following the same path which means</text>
  <text start="749.49" dur="7.44">we&amp;#39;re going to end up exactly how it was</text>
  <text start="752.85" dur="5.85">in 2008 except for one big problem it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="756.93" dur="5.07">going to be about a hundred times worse</text>
  <text start="758.7" dur="6.03">this time it&amp;#39;s going to be a complete</text>
  <text start="762" dur="6.15">disaster because they didn&amp;#39;t fix the</text>
  <text start="764.73" dur="5.58">problem all they did was take out</text>
  <text start="768.15" dur="5.07">another credit card another credit card</text>
  <text start="770.31" dur="6.63">another credit card and pretended that</text>
  <text start="773.22" dur="5.76">we had all this cash they pumped up the</text>
  <text start="776.94" dur="5.58">banks they pumped up the stock market</text>
  <text start="778.98" dur="5.37">made everyone feel good now it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="782.52" dur="4.17">everyone because we know that there was</text>
  <text start="784.35" dur="4.5">a lot of Americans who are getting hurt</text>
  <text start="786.69" dur="5.1">by this but the news doesn&amp;#39;t report on</text>
  <text start="788.85" dur="4.41">it people get food stamps and you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="791.79" dur="3.48">actually get the paper stamps you get</text>
  <text start="793.26" dur="3.3">the little card that you use new swipe</text>
  <text start="795.27" dur="2.73">it looks like a credit card so nobody</text>
  <text start="796.56" dur="3.84">really knows that you&amp;#39;re even on it and</text>
  <text start="798" dur="5.52">all these individuals that&amp;#39;s why we saw</text>
  <text start="800.4" dur="6.93">the food stamps rising over these years</text>
  <text start="803.52" dur="5.19">this is why we see more people being not</text>
  <text start="807.33" dur="4.56">included in the unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="808.71" dur="6.39">this was all done on purpose well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="811.89" dur="6.99">at that point already where the whole</text>
  <text start="815.1" dur="7.02">thing is coming to an end it came to an</text>
  <text start="818.88" dur="5.34">end in 2008 if I was talking like this</text>
  <text start="822.12" dur="3.57">in two thousand six people would say you</text>
  <text start="824.22" dur="4.02">have no idea what you&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="825.69" dur="4.86">the economy will never crash look at the</text>
  <text start="828.24" dur="6.11">prices of the homes look at the stock</text>
  <text start="830.55" dur="9.12">market but again look what happened in</text>
  <text start="834.35" dur="7.63">2008-2009 here we are in 2017 nothing</text>
  <text start="839.67" dur="5.01">has changed except it&amp;#39;s gotten a lot</text>
  <text start="841.98" dur="5.43">worse so get prepared for what is coming</text>
