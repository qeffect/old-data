  <text start="159.33" dur="4.05">think we all know why perhaps it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="161.25" dur="4.08">because we are moving the knee</text>

  <text start="182.94" dur="4.59">in less than half of what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="184.53" dur="5.67">generating thus far and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>

  <text start="219.33" dur="4.74">numbers might seem like they&amp;#39;re a lot</text>
  <text start="221.37" dur="4.65">but I believe they should be much much</text>
  <text start="224.07" dur="6.54">higher than that and why do I say this</text>
  <text start="226.02" dur="7.29">well michelle malkin she tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="230.61" dur="5.49">following hashtag stopped the bias</text>

  <text start="245.52" dur="7.17">time she clicks the follow button it</text>
  <text start="249.57" dur="6">seems like she&amp;#39;s following on plan but</text>
  <text start="252.69" dur="5.43">when she goes back to it it shows that</text>
  <text start="255.57" dur="5.34">she needs to click follow again so that</text>
  <text start="258.12" dur="4.65">means she&amp;#39;s actually not following it</text>
  <text start="260.91" dur="6.24">now think about this do you really think</text>
  <text start="262.77" dur="6.78">she is the only one no there&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="267.15" dur="5.58">thousands upon thousands of people that</text>
  <text start="269.55" dur="6.39">are experiencing the same thing does</text>
  <text start="272.73" dur="6.15">that mean that Twitter is purposely</text>
  <text start="275.94" dur="6.27">doing this well unplanned was brought</text>

  <text start="284.73" dur="8.64">never had any other problems until now I</text>
  <text start="289.31" dur="6.04">mean do we need any more proof I mean</text>
  <text start="293.37" dur="5.07">this is just unbelievable</text>
  <text start="295.35" dur="4.98">now the white house they are working on</text>
  <text start="298.44" dur="4.14">a secret health care plan with three</text>
  <text start="300.33" dur="4.86">conservative think things we understand</text>
  <text start="302.58" dur="3.81">that Obamacare has been ruled to be</text>
  <text start="305.19" dur="3.78">unconstitutional</text>
  <text start="306.39" dur="5.76">which means they&amp;#39;re going to get rid of</text>
  <text start="308.97" dur="5.37">Obamacare so they&amp;#39;re working on a new</text>
  <text start="312.15" dur="3.87">health care system right now so the</text>
  <text start="314.34" dur="3.78">white house mainly through the National</text>
  <text start="316.02" dur="4.08">Economic Council has been engaged on</text>
  <text start="318.12" dur="3.84">thinking about health care reform for a</text>
  <text start="320.1" dur="4.32">while now and they&amp;#39;ve been engaged with</text>
  <text start="321.96" dur="4.05">a group of center-right health policy</text>
  <text start="324.42" dur="3.84">groups to talk about various proposals</text>
  <text start="326.01" dur="3.75">and ideas the analyst said the</text>
  <text start="328.26" dur="3.36">administration has been having</text>
  <text start="329.76" dur="4.17">conversations on health care policy and</text>
  <text start="331.62" dur="4.59">has reached out to numerous think tanks</text>
  <text start="333.93" dur="4.14">including the Heritage Foundation the</text>
  <text start="336.21" dur="3.93">Mercatus Center and the Hoover Institute</text>
  <text start="338.07" dur="3.69">and I believe that they&amp;#39;ve been working</text>
  <text start="340.14" dur="4.89">on this for a lot longer than they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="341.76" dur="5.61">letting on actually it worked out a lot</text>
  <text start="345.03" dur="4.23">better this way where they didn&amp;#39;t vote</text>
  <text start="347.37" dur="4.38">down Obamacare right off the bat because</text>
  <text start="349.26" dur="5.04">you know why they really didn&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="351.75" dur="3.96">health care plan at that time and I</text>
  <text start="354.3" dur="3.93">think it would have been an absolute</text>
  <text start="355.71" dur="6.45">disaster now they had the ability to</text>
  <text start="358.23" dur="7.17">take the time to work out a solid new</text>
  <text start="362.16" dur="6.42">plan that&amp;#39;s going to benefit the</text>
  <text start="365.4" dur="4.5">American people it&amp;#39;s going to benefit</text>
  <text start="368.58" dur="2.51">them in a way that we&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="369.9" dur="3.18">before</text>
  <text start="371.09" dur="4.57">we see that the House Judiciary</text>
  <text start="373.08" dur="6.69">Committee led by Chery Chairman Jerry</text>
  <text start="375.66" dur="6.9">Nadler they voted to authorize subpoenas</text>
  <text start="379.77" dur="5.61">for a full unredacted copy of the nearly</text>
  <text start="382.56" dur="5.28">400 page Mullah report and Nadler is out</text>
  <text start="385.38" dur="5.25">there saying we want this we want this</text>
  <text start="387.84" dur="4.56">now now Barr sent Nadler and Senate</text>
  <text start="390.63" dur="3.42">Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham a</text>
  <text start="392.4" dur="3.6">letter notifying them that he was</text>
  <text start="394.05" dur="3.81">working with Muller to redact sensitive</text>
  <text start="396" dur="4.62">information which could affect ongoing</text>
  <text start="397.86" dur="4.62">matters including grand jury material</text>
  <text start="400.62" dur="3.45">information that would infringe on</text>
  <text start="402.48" dur="3.81">someone&amp;#39;s personal privacy or</text>
  <text start="404.07" dur="3.48">information which could compromise the</text>
  <text start="406.29" dur="4.74">Department of Justice sources and</text>
  <text start="407.55" dur="6.21">methods of investigation Nadler</text>
  <text start="411.03" dur="6.09">responded this isn&amp;#39;t good enough we want</text>
  <text start="413.76" dur="5.42">the whole thing on redacted so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="417.12" dur="7.2">stop and think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="419.18" dur="8.73">so the enemy wants an unredacted report</text>
  <text start="424.32" dur="6.48">and they want the whole thing</text>
  <text start="427.91" dur="4.99">transparent they don&amp;#39;t want any read</text>
  <text start="430.8" dur="6.179">actions they don&amp;#39;t care if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="432.9" dur="7.74">classified they don&amp;#39;t care if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="436.979" dur="6.091">something personal to an individual they</text>
  <text start="440.64" dur="6.96">don&amp;#39;t care about that they want to see</text>
  <text start="443.07" dur="8.04">it all so if we take what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="447.6" dur="8.7">and we apply it to the uranium one</text>
  <text start="451.11" dur="9.36">scandal the Clinton email server 911 and</text>
  <text start="456.3" dur="7.47">the rest should we not see the complete</text>
  <text start="460.47" dur="7.17">and unredacted investigations to all of</text>
  <text start="463.77" dur="7.35">that going back in time I mean like qoe</text>
  <text start="467.64" dur="6.21">says one these people are stupid too why</text>
  <text start="471.12" dur="5.01">interfere with an enemy while they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="473.85" dur="4.5">destroying themselves because we know</text>
  <text start="476.13" dur="4.38">the reports gonna say nothing but it</text>
  <text start="478.35" dur="4.26">opens them up to think about what Muller</text>
  <text start="480.51" dur="7.05">did during the investigation he pulled</text>
  <text start="482.61" dur="7.68">all these people in for lying and the</text>
  <text start="487.56" dur="5.01">mainstream media was behind it the deep</text>
  <text start="490.29" dur="5.64">state was behind it and now it can be</text>
  <text start="492.57" dur="6.3">used against them this report can be</text>
  <text start="495.93" dur="4.92">used against them because anytime they</text>
  <text start="498.87" dur="5.37">say no it has to stay redacted no you</text>
  <text start="500.85" dur="5.94">can&amp;#39;t see this well guess what you asked</text>
  <text start="504.24" dur="6.02">for an unredacted report now everything</text>
  <text start="506.79" dur="7.62">can be unredacted because as Q says</text>
  <text start="510.26" dur="6.79">transparency is the only way forward now</text>
  <text start="514.41" dur="5.069">it has been confirmed that Muller</text>
  <text start="517.05" dur="6.15">dragged out this investigation for more</text>
  <text start="519.479" dur="6.811">than a year after finishing it he</text>
  <text start="523.2" dur="4.98">exhausted his investigation into Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="526.29" dur="5.46">non-existent Russian collusion in</text>
  <text start="528.18" dur="5.37">December 2017 but kept the investigation</text>
  <text start="531.75" dur="3.9">going for more than a year even though</text>
  <text start="533.55" dur="4.05">he was warned that he was impeding</text>
  <text start="535.65" dur="4.32">Trump&amp;#39;s inability to govern the United</text>
  <text start="537.6" dur="4.59">States of America by early December</text>
  <text start="539.97" dur="4.92">he had exhausted all the evidence</text>
  <text start="542.19" dur="6.39">evidence and the witnesses Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.89" dur="5.37">former lawyer John Dowd said so now we</text>
  <text start="548.58" dur="4.02">know that the operation crossfire</text>
  <text start="550.26" dur="3.87">hurricane conspirators allowed the media</text>
  <text start="552.6" dur="4.5">narrative to continue through the 2018</text>
  <text start="554.13" dur="5.1">midterms with no evidence would that</text>
  <text start="557.1" dur="6.42">qualify as election interfere</text>
  <text start="559.23" dur="8.1">Kew says yes and once again they did</text>
  <text start="563.52" dur="6.36">this on purpose to keep the firewall in</text>
  <text start="567.33" dur="4.77">place to win the 2018 elections by</text>
  <text start="569.88" dur="5.94">saying that he&amp;#39;s under investigation for</text>
  <text start="572.1" dur="6.739">Russian collusion you imagine if the</text>
  <text start="575.82" dur="5.07">report came out before the elections I</text>
  <text start="578.839" dur="4.831">don&amp;#39;t believe they would have gotten the</text>
  <text start="580.89" dur="7.02">number of seats they would have gotten</text>
  <text start="583.67" dur="5.95">so the question is first of all does</text>
  <text start="587.91" dur="3.33">Muller have to repay all this does the</text>
  <text start="589.62" dur="3.779">mainstream media have to repay all this</text>
  <text start="591.24" dur="4.32">does the deep State have to repay all</text>
  <text start="593.399" dur="4.581">this because they went a year longer</text>
  <text start="595.56" dur="5.61">with this investigation for no reason</text>
  <text start="597.98" dur="6.01">well we know that&amp;#39;s not gonna happen but</text>
  <text start="601.17" dur="5.85">we have other surprises for them they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="603.99" dur="5.73">going down now Judicial Watch they filed</text>

  <text start="1374.75" dur="4.95">free speech because remember what</text>
  <text start="1377.81" dur="5.58">offends one group doesn&amp;#39;t offend another</text>

  <text start="1645.61" dur="4.42">that&amp;#39;s why they put it in there just</text>
  <text start="1649.19" dur="3.96">like that</text>
  <text start="1650.03" dur="6.54">because they knew that weapons would</text>

  <text start="1685.28" dur="4.29">the deep state wants to make it very</text>

  <text start="1689.57" dur="4.2">like we don&amp;#39;t have these rights and they</text>
  <text start="1691.97" dur="4.79">can take them away at any time which</text>
  <text start="1693.77" dur="6.48">they cannot we see out in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1696.76" dur="5.77">poroshenko is running an election and it</text>
  <text start="1700.25" dur="4.73">looks like poroshenko is losing ground</text>
  <text start="1702.53" dur="5.52">with 70% of a balance counted and</text>
  <text start="1704.98" dur="4.75">Vladimir Zielinski leads the race now</text>
  <text start="1708.05" dur="3.51">this is very interesting because if you</text>
  <text start="1709.73" dur="5.28">go back to the time where we had the</text>
  <text start="1711.56" dur="5.37">coup d&amp;#39;etat for regime change in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1715.01" dur="4.41">poroshenko was actually placed in this</text>
  <text start="1716.93" dur="4.83">position and he&amp;#39;s destroyed the country</text>
  <text start="1719.42" dur="5.34">actually the deep state destroyed the</text>
  <text start="1721.76" dur="5.16">entire country and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="1724.76" dur="4.65">people are fed up right now and it looks</text>
  <text start="1726.92" dur="4.5">like poroshenko is going to be pushed</text>
  <text start="1729.41" dur="5.25">out unless he does something to stay in</text>
  <text start="1731.42" dur="5.16">power and this might tell you something</text>
  <text start="1734.66" dur="3.15">things might be changing because you</text>
  <text start="1736.58" dur="3">have to remember queue has been telling</text>
  <text start="1737.81" dur="4.53">us and Trump has been telling us that</text>
  <text start="1739.58" dur="5.67">instead of Russian collusion it might be</text>
  <text start="1742.34" dur="4.74">Ukrainian collusion so we might see a</text>
  <text start="1745.25" dur="5.22">lot of things change</text>
  <text start="1747.08" dur="5.689">once this is all said and done now very</text>
  <text start="1750.47" dur="6.449">interestingly Comey has tweeted out</text>
  <text start="1752.769" dur="7.54">another strange coded message he says</text>
