  <text start="188.88" dur="7.41">illusion well this economy right now is</text>
  <text start="192.81" dur="5.18">built on the same illusion the only</text>
  <text start="196.29" dur="7.49">thing they did different this time is</text>

  <text start="211.17" dur="2.91">economy is going to be getting better</text>
  <text start="212.31" dur="5.1">because we can see from the conference</text>
  <text start="214.08" dur="6.27">board consumer confidence it has soared</text>
  <text start="217.41" dur="6.21">to 107 point 1 in November post Trump</text>
  <text start="220.35" dur="6.87">this is the highest since july of 2007</text>

  <text start="227.22" dur="5.31">saw economic confidence at its highest</text>
  <text start="228.99" dur="5.67">level since before Lehman and we know</text>
  <text start="232.53" dur="3.96">what happened in 2008 when people</text>
  <text start="234.66" dur="3.33">thought the things were going to be</text>
  <text start="236.49" dur="3.93">different when they thought there was</text>
  <text start="237.99" dur="6.54">going to be change all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="240.42" dur="7.89">economy crashed and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="244.53" dur="5.429">that Americans they feel positive not</text>
  <text start="248.31" dur="6.06">every single American but this is what</text>
  <text start="249.959" dur="8.491">the surveys are showing and this is the</text>
  <text start="254.37" dur="7.549">best Gallup a scene this is the best</text>
  <text start="258.45" dur="9.8">that the conference board has seen and</text>
  <text start="261.919" dur="10.391">we can see right now this is a setup</text>
  <text start="268.25" dur="8.7">what are they setting up well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="272.31" dur="10.44">setting up the entire economy to</text>
  <text start="276.95" dur="7.87">collapse during Trump&amp;#39;s ring what have</text>
  <text start="282.75" dur="5.7">they been doing well they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="284.82" dur="7.44">pumping this economy up in all different</text>
  <text start="288.45" dur="9">areas they created bubbles in all</text>
  <text start="292.26" dur="8.43">different economic sectors the housing</text>
  <text start="297.45" dur="5.85">bubble right now they&amp;#39;re saying that us</text>
  <text start="300.69" dur="5.28">home prices just rose above july two</text>
  <text start="303.3" dur="5.61">thousand six levels new record highs</text>
  <text start="305.97" dur="6.48">this is coming from Case Shiller and you</text>
  <text start="308.91" dur="5.7">have to remember this information that</text>
  <text start="312.45" dur="5.51">they&amp;#39;re telling us about now</text>
  <text start="314.61" dur="7.38">was from September things have changed</text>
  <text start="317.96" dur="7.06">mortgage rates have inched up mortgage</text>
  <text start="321.99" dur="5.31">apps have declined refinancing has</text>
  <text start="325.02" dur="4.649">declined but you have to remember</text>
  <text start="327.3" dur="4.95">case-shiller only looks at certain</text>
  <text start="329.669" dur="5.191">cities around the country and if you go</text>
  <text start="332.25" dur="5.819">on to like Zillow if you go on to</text>
  <text start="334.86" dur="5.489">realtor.com or any of these sites you</text>
  <text start="338.069" dur="7.19">can see in many different areas of the</text>
  <text start="340.349" dur="7.741">country housing prices are being reduced</text>
  <text start="345.259" dur="5.56">people can&amp;#39;t sell their houses houses</text>
  <text start="348.09" dur="4.049">are on the market longer and longer but</text>
  <text start="350.819" dur="3.75">they don&amp;#39;t want you to know about this</text>
  <text start="352.139" dur="4.68">just like in 2008 subprime securities</text>
  <text start="354.569" dur="4.53">were fantastic Bernanke said it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="356.819" dur="4.56">impossible for housing to drop in price</text>
  <text start="359.099" dur="5.611">we&amp;#39;ve never seen anything like this and</text>
  <text start="361.379" dur="7.26">why would I even think about that but</text>
  <text start="364.71" dur="8.489">this is all about Obama he&amp;#39;s leaving the</text>
  <text start="368.639" dur="8.39">White House he wants his legacy to show</text>
  <text start="373.199" dur="6.78">that he completely repaired the country</text>
  <text start="377.029" dur="7.721">he took us out of the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="379.979" dur="7.5">and he created a strong economy the only</text>
  <text start="384.75" dur="5.849">problem is he&amp;#39;s never had a quarter</text>
  <text start="387.479" dur="4.891">where gdp was above three percent he got</text>
  <text start="390.599" dur="2.91">close right before the election they</text>
  <text start="392.37" dur="5.579">were able to bring it up to two point</text>
  <text start="393.509" dur="7.53">nine percent when they exported soybeans</text>
  <text start="397.949" dur="5.19">which is a one-off thing but don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="401.039" dur="6.09">because they just revised the third</text>
  <text start="403.139" dur="7.53">quarter GDP and Obama got his wish it is</text>
  <text start="407.129" dur="6.54">now at three-point-two percent so he</text>
  <text start="410.669" dur="7.731">won&amp;#39;t be the only president that didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="413.669" dur="6.84">get gdp over three percent he did it</text>
  <text start="418.4" dur="4.75">amazing it&amp;#39;s almost like right before</text>
  <text start="420.509" dur="3.75">the elections the GDP number came out at</text>
  <text start="423.15" dur="3.15">two point nine percent to show the</text>
  <text start="424.259" dur="3.21">economy was doing well unemployment all</text>
  <text start="426.3" dur="5.01">of a sudden dropped a four point nine</text>
  <text start="427.469" dur="6.651">percent again a set up and actually if</text>
  <text start="431.31" dur="6.93">you look at these numbers most of it is</text>
  <text start="434.12" dur="6.849">a manipulation actually if you took the</text>
  <text start="438.24" dur="5.7">point three percent the point three</text>
  <text start="440.969" dur="7.051">percentage points and you divided by 4</text>
  <text start="443.94" dur="5.49">because GDP reports our annualized</text>
  <text start="448.02" dur="4.799">does this really look meaningful</text>
  <text start="449.43" dur="6.989">meaningful at all no it does not but the</text>
  <text start="452.819" dur="5.241">corporate media is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="456.419" dur="4.861">making a very big deal about this</text>
  <text start="458.06" dur="6.49">they&amp;#39;re saying that Obama is handing</text>
  <text start="461.28" dur="6.599">over the keys to the US economy the</text>
  <text start="464.55" dur="8.88">world&amp;#39;s largest and most important with</text>
  <text start="467.879" dur="10.051">the engine running smoothly he&amp;#39;s handing</text>
  <text start="473.43" dur="7.41">over a healthy economy you&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="477.93" dur="6.959">that Obama has overseen an impressive</text>
  <text start="480.84" dur="6.479">economic recovery and they went back in</text>
  <text start="484.889" dur="5.28">time saying when he took office back in</text>
  <text start="487.319" dur="5.13">October of 2009 unemployment was at ten</text>
  <text start="490.169" dur="5.731">percent he brought it all the way down</text>
  <text start="492.449" dur="7.44">to four point nine percent and we can</text>
  <text start="495.9" dur="11.489">see right now that job growth has been</text>
  <text start="499.889" dur="9.661">growing for 73 straight months and what</text>
  <text start="507.389" dur="5.131">they&amp;#39;re saying is once he hands this</text>
  <text start="509.55" dur="7.049">over to trump and Trump is in the</text>
  <text start="512.52" dur="10.29">driver&amp;#39;s seat will he be able to keep</text>
  <text start="516.599" dur="12.001">the engine purring or will he drive the</text>
  <text start="522.81" dur="11.339">economy into a ditch they&amp;#39;re setting</text>
  <text start="528.6" dur="10.77">this up for a major major collapse now</text>
  <text start="534.149" dur="6.93">while all this is going on and the</text>
