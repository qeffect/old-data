  <text start="58.59" dur="6.81">episode 1348 and today&amp;#39;s date is July</text>
  <text start="62.16" dur="5.4">24th 2017 and a part of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.4" dur="4.91">countries are ramping up on gold</text>
  <text start="67.56" dur="4.949">purchases as that dollar takes a dive</text>
  <text start="70.31" dur="4.75">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="72.509" dur="4.981">financial news now we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="75.06" dur="5.4">real estate over the many years now and</text>
  <text start="77.49" dur="6.18">we&amp;#39;ve always noticed that during the</text>
  <text start="80.46" dur="4.89">summer months this is the hot time for</text>
  <text start="83.67" dur="3.99">real estate where real estate is really</text>
  <text start="85.35" dur="5.129">supposed to do very very well because we</text>
  <text start="87.66" dur="6">ran to the winter months and it is now</text>
  <text start="90.479" dur="4.89">sunny it&amp;#39;s warmer the grass is green the</text>
  <text start="93.66" dur="4.23">flowers are blooming and people like to</text>
  <text start="95.369" dur="5.521">get into their homes before most likely</text>
  <text start="97.89" dur="4.83">the schools start and we see during this</text>
  <text start="100.89" dur="5.1">period of time spring going into summer</text>
  <text start="102.72" dur="5.069">that real estate does very very well and</text>
  <text start="105.99" dur="3.96">over the past couple of years we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="107.789" dur="4.711">seeing the actual opposite happen and</text>
  <text start="109.95" dur="4.949">now we are seeing this year where real</text>
  <text start="112.5" dur="4.74">estate during the summer months now it</text>
  <text start="114.899" dur="5.131">is the worst we&amp;#39;ve ever seen going all</text>
  <text start="117.24" dur="4.98">the way back to 2011 now existing home</text>
  <text start="120.03" dur="3.78">sales they have plunged and they are</text>
  <text start="122.22" dur="3.87">down by 1.8%</text>
  <text start="123.81" dur="3.869">now they declined a lot more than</text>
  <text start="126.09" dur="3.539">expected they only expected to go down</text>
  <text start="127.679" dur="4.64">point nine percent so it doubled and</text>
  <text start="129.629" dur="5.821">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="132.319" dur="5.381">people are not out there purchasing</text>
  <text start="135.45" dur="4.86">homes now we do see interest rates</text>
  <text start="137.7" dur="4.14">creeping up and once again this kicks a</text>
  <text start="140.31" dur="4.92">lot of people out of the market and if</text>
  <text start="141.84" dur="4.649">interest rates move up any further guess</text>
  <text start="145.23" dur="3.509">what&amp;#39;s going to happen to real estate</text>
  <text start="146.489" dur="4.801">it&amp;#39;s going to completely crumble and</text>
  <text start="148.739" dur="6.291">fall apart and it just doesn&amp;#39;t affect</text>
  <text start="151.29" dur="6.39">the homes it affects everything else</text>
  <text start="155.03" dur="5.86">those individuals that do the plumbing</text>
  <text start="157.68" dur="5.55">the electricity lumber sales concrete</text>
  <text start="160.89" dur="6.09">sales furnishings everything you name it</text>
  <text start="163.23" dur="6.41">it affects every piece of the economic</text>
  <text start="166.98" dur="5.009">sector that has to do with housing and</text>
  <text start="169.64" dur="5.52">what we are seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="171.989" dur="8.011">this summer selling season it is</text>
  <text start="175.16" dur="6.579">absolutely awful and we know why a lot</text>
  <text start="180" dur="4.68">of people well they just don&amp;#39;t have jobs</text>
  <text start="181.739" dur="5.821">a lot of people have part-time jobs a</text>
  <text start="184.68" dur="5.13">lot of people cannot save up to</text>
  <text start="187.56" dur="5.7">get that down payment because wages are</text>
  <text start="189.81" dur="5.13">continually decreasing and we can see</text>
  <text start="193.26" dur="4.29">right now that the National Association</text>
  <text start="194.94" dur="4.44">of Realtors Lawrence Young he&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="197.55" dur="3.87">there saying well it looks like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="199.38" dur="4.859">shaping up to be another year of below</text>
  <text start="201.42" dur="5.58">average sales for the first-time buyers</text>
  <text start="204.239" dur="5.821">despite this healthy economy and this</text>
  <text start="207" dur="5.819">low and unemployment rate now once again</text>
  <text start="210.06" dur="6.3">the unemployment rate is completely</text>
  <text start="212.819" dur="6.061">manipulated secondly the first-time</text>
  <text start="216.36" dur="4.08">homebuyers these individuals that are</text>
  <text start="218.88" dur="3.81">coming out of college they have a huge</text>
  <text start="220.44" dur="3.87">amount of student loans they can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="222.69" dur="5.129">great jobs are living with their parents</text>
  <text start="224.31" dur="6.12">and this economy is not healthy the</text>
  <text start="227.819" dur="5.431">whole thing is a complete illusion and</text>
  <text start="230.43" dur="5.309">you have to remember lawrence yun was</text>
  <text start="233.25" dur="4.89">all the way back saying back in 2008</text>
  <text start="235.739" dur="5.161">that the real estate market was going to</text>
  <text start="238.14" dur="5.58">clear up by 2009 so right there and then</text>
  <text start="240.9" dur="6.03">we know something is wrong here</text>
  <text start="243.72" dur="6.629">now caterpillar retail sales they have</text>
  <text start="246.93" dur="4.05">been improving now we need to clarify</text>
  <text start="250.349" dur="2.881">this</text>
  <text start="250.98" dur="7.349">they&amp;#39;ve been improving in the Chinese</text>
  <text start="253.23" dur="7.62">and other Asians and we can see that</text>
  <text start="258.329" dur="5.971">sales are up there and they&amp;#39;ve been up</text>
  <text start="260.85" dur="6.81">for what maybe 2 3 months now but what</text>
  <text start="264.3" dur="5.7">we see is that sales have been down for</text>
  <text start="267.66" dur="5.34">something like 51 months or something</text>
  <text start="270" dur="4.95">like that and we have a couple of months</text>
  <text start="273" dur="4.289">where it is propped up but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="274.95" dur="4.83">looking at right now is that these sales</text>
  <text start="277.289" dur="5.85">are fading once again so it looks like</text>
  <text start="279.78" dur="5.25">China pushed one more time and it looks</text>
  <text start="283.139" dur="4.291">like it&amp;#39;s not moving anywhere here in</text>
  <text start="285.03" dur="5.58">the United States sales are terrible</text>
  <text start="287.43" dur="5.43">South America sales are terrible so it</text>
  <text start="290.61" dur="4.8">looks like this is a one-off bump up</text>
  <text start="292.86" dur="4.08">that lasted maybe 2 or 3 months and it</text>
  <text start="295.41" dur="4.41">looks like we&amp;#39;re going back to the way</text>
  <text start="296.94" dur="6.87">we were because the economy has not</text>
  <text start="299.82" dur="6.12">improved whatsoever and when we look at</text>
  <text start="303.81" dur="5.34">the economy over the many many years</text>
  <text start="305.94" dur="5.19">going all the way back to the 1970s when</text>
  <text start="309.15" dur="5.06">we were put on to this petro dollar</text>
  <text start="311.13" dur="7.5">system we can see that in the last</text>
  <text start="314.21" dur="6.69">couple of years during george w bush</text>
  <text start="318.63" dur="5.42">during obama</text>
  <text start="320.9" dur="7.23">the economy has slowed now remember</text>
  <text start="324.05" dur="6.48">we&amp;#39;re at the back end of this petrol</text>
  <text start="328.13" dur="4.92">dollar system in the beginning when it</text>
  <text start="330.53" dur="4.62">was first coming online there was very</text>
  <text start="333.05" dur="4.14">little bit of debt we see interest rates</text>
  <text start="335.15" dur="5.19">were moving up very very high people</text>
  <text start="337.19" dur="4.95">were like Oh put it in CDs at 18% we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="340.34" dur="4.02">getting great returns on our money and</text>
  <text start="342.14" dur="4.83">of course the value of a dollar</text>
  <text start="344.36" dur="4.98">decreased we saw inflation people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="346.97" dur="4.89">salaries jumped housing jumped</text>
  <text start="349.34" dur="6.21">everything jumped and it sounded and it</text>
  <text start="351.86" dur="8.55">felt fantastic and the economy from 1975</text>
  <text start="355.55" dur="6.98">to around 1980 it grew by 19% from that</text>
  <text start="360.41" dur="5.37">point on it looks like it grew another</text>
  <text start="362.53" dur="5.29">21% when we hit the 90s and then all of</text>
  <text start="365.78" dur="4.29">a sudden when we hit the year 2000</text>
  <text start="367.82" dur="6.18">everything came to a screeching halt</text>
  <text start="370.07" dur="7.35">from 2000 on the economy only grew about</text>
  <text start="374" dur="5.52">four percent up to 2008 then we had this</text>
  <text start="377.42" dur="5.64">great illusion that we were in this</text>
  <text start="379.52" dur="5.79">recovery and the economy only grew 3%</text>
  <text start="383.06" dur="4.56">and what we see right now is that</text>
  <text start="385.31" dur="5.25">everything is falling apart because as</text>
  <text start="387.62" dur="5.43">we know this type of system this fayette</text>
  <text start="390.56" dur="5.43">system it only lasts for a certain</text>
  <text start="393.05" dur="5.49">period of time once you remove all the</text>
  <text start="395.99" dur="5.37">manufacturing once you remove all these</text>
  <text start="398.54" dur="8.13">service jobs once you do all of this</text>
  <text start="401.36" dur="9.12">guess what happens everything falls</text>
  <text start="406.67" dur="6.66">apart slowly but surely and look what is</text>
  <text start="410.48" dur="5.13">happening right now there is no way with</text>
  <text start="413.33" dur="4.14">the amount of debt that we have with all</text>
  <text start="415.61" dur="4.41">the manufacturing gone in this country</text>
  <text start="417.47" dur="6.27">with the service sector being hit very</text>
  <text start="420.02" dur="6.72">very hard can anything actually happen</text>
  <text start="423.74" dur="4.5">all of this has to be wiped out and we</text>
  <text start="426.74" dur="4.4">need to start over it&amp;#39;s almost like a</text>
  <text start="428.24" dur="6.53">bad business where you have so much debt</text>
  <text start="431.14" dur="5.59">revenue is not coming in the revenue is</text>
  <text start="434.77" dur="4.21">non-existent it cannot support the</text>
  <text start="436.73" dur="4.92">business and the whole thing is just</text>
  <text start="438.98" dur="4.59">bleeding money and there&amp;#39;s no way around</text>
  <text start="441.65" dur="4.32">it what happens to these corporations</text>
  <text start="443.57" dur="5.1">they declare bankruptcy they&amp;#39;ll wipe out</text>
  <text start="445.97" dur="6.3">the debt this is what happens to happen</text>
  <text start="448.67" dur="6.15">here in the United States all of this</text>
  <text start="452.27" dur="5.22">needs to be wiped out this is what we</text>
  <text start="454.82" dur="5.94">call a reset now the IMS is out there</text>
  <text start="457.49" dur="4.56">and we know that their forecasts aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="460.76" dur="4.26">that great they say oh yeah we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="462.05" dur="4.32">to be having growth about 3% 4% and we</text>
  <text start="465.02" dur="3.12">know that this is absolutely ridiculous</text>
  <text start="466.37" dur="3.42">and most of the time these GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="468.14" dur="5.52">are manipulated anyhow but they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="469.79" dur="7.26">dropped the growth rate here in the</text>
  <text start="473.66" dur="5.88">United States and in the UK now out in</text>
  <text start="477.05" dur="5.61">the UK they&amp;#39;re saying that well growth</text>
  <text start="479.54" dur="6.6">in the UK is going to be around 1.7</text>
  <text start="482.66" dur="5.1">percent now they drop this from a 2%</text>
  <text start="486.14" dur="4.11">forecast now they always start out very</text>
  <text start="487.76" dur="4.71">very high and they continually drop it</text>
  <text start="490.25" dur="5.25">as we move further and further into the</text>
  <text start="492.47" dur="5.13">year in 2018 they&amp;#39;re saying yeah it</text>
  <text start="495.5" dur="4.71">looks like growth in the UK is going to</text>
  <text start="497.6" dur="5.16">be around 1.5 here in the United States</text>
  <text start="500.21" dur="5.61">they started at like 3% they dropped it</text>
  <text start="502.76" dur="4.92">down to 2% to 0.7 percent down to 2.3</text>
  <text start="505.82" dur="5.51">percent and now they&amp;#39;re bringing it to</text>
  <text start="507.68" dur="6.96">2.1 percent now remember this is also a</text>
  <text start="511.33" dur="5.74">manipulated number this is they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="514.64" dur="4.89">changed the calculation they massaged</text>
  <text start="517.07" dur="4.74">the calculation they throw things in</text>
  <text start="519.53" dur="5.37">there and they try to make it sound and</text>
  <text start="521.81" dur="5.46">look a lot better than it really is and</text>
  <text start="524.9" dur="5.58">we can see right now as we move forward</text>
  <text start="527.27" dur="5.61">well the economy is really getting worse</text>
  <text start="530.48" dur="4.95">and worse and worse now countries</text>
  <text start="532.88" dur="4.86">realize that there is a major problem</text>
  <text start="535.43" dur="5.34">especially where the dollar is at at</text>
  <text start="537.74" dur="4.56">endgame Russia is looking at this China</text>
  <text start="540.77" dur="3.51">is looking at this India is looking at</text>
  <text start="542.3" dur="4.02">this and now Turkey all of these</text>
  <text start="544.28" dur="4.95">countries and many others have been</text>
  <text start="546.32" dur="5.4">purchasing a lot of gold and we see that</text>
  <text start="549.23" dur="4.5">Turkey well they&amp;#39;re buying gold like</text>
  <text start="551.72" dur="4.17">there&amp;#39;s no tomorrow</text>
  <text start="553.73" dur="5.79">they understand now they&amp;#39;re on board</text>
  <text start="555.89" dur="6.54">with Russia and China and we also see</text>
  <text start="559.52" dur="5.37">Belarus Kazakhstan they&amp;#39;re buying a lot</text>
  <text start="562.43" dur="4.29">of gold to all these countries are</text>
  <text start="564.89" dur="5.52">buying a lot of gold because they</text>
  <text start="566.72" dur="7.47">understand this preserves their wealth</text>
  <text start="570.41" dur="6.72">as the dollar disappears as the dollar</text>
  <text start="574.19" dur="5.04">crashes what are they going to have left</text>
  <text start="577.13" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re going to have gold and when</text>
  <text start="579.23" dur="4.32">everything is said and done and they</text>
  <text start="581.87" dur="2.37">look at what the new currency is going</text>
  <text start="583.55" dur="2.34">to be maybe it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="584.24" dur="4.27">cryptocurrency they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="585.89" dur="5.17">recalculate how much that goal</text>
  <text start="588.51" dur="4.71">is worth and over thousands and</text>
  <text start="591.06" dur="5.82">thousands of years guess what</text>
  <text start="593.22" dur="4.89">gold always maintains its value one way</text>
  <text start="596.88" dur="4.14">or another depending on what the</text>
  <text start="598.11" dur="6">currency is and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="601.02" dur="5.55">this is what countries are preparing for</text>
  <text start="604.11" dur="6.54">now we see and we mentioned this before</text>
  <text start="606.57" dur="6.75">visa they are looking to have many of</text>
  <text start="610.65" dur="4.23">the businesses go cashless and it looks</text>
  <text start="613.32" dur="4.32">like they&amp;#39;re preparing for a cash flow</text>
  <text start="614.88" dur="3.39">Society banks are preparing for a Cancer</text>
  <text start="617.64" dur="2.55">Society</text>
  <text start="618.27" dur="4.02">they don&amp;#39;t want individuals using cash</text>
  <text start="620.19" dur="4.98">they want total control but we see that</text>
  <text start="622.29" dur="5.82">Visa American Express MasterCard</text>
  <text start="625.17" dur="5.67">all these credit card credit type of</text>
  <text start="628.11" dur="3.24">systems well they&amp;#39;re doing it for one</text>
  <text start="630.84" dur="2.75">reason</text>
  <text start="631.35" dur="4.38">while the banking system and the</text>
  <text start="633.59" dur="2.59">banksters they&amp;#39;re doing it for another</text>
  <text start="635.73" dur="3.03">reason</text>
  <text start="636.18" dur="4.59">the credit system they&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="638.76" dur="4.86">have everyone on their system so they</text>
  <text start="640.77" dur="5.91">can improve profits with transaction</text>
  <text start="643.62" dur="6.3">fees and it would generate billions upon</text>
  <text start="646.68" dur="7.05">billions of dollars worth of transaction</text>
  <text start="649.92" dur="6.21">fees if everyone is off cash and the</text>
  <text start="653.73" dur="7.13">push is throughout Europe it&amp;#39;s in Asia</text>
  <text start="656.13" dur="9.66">and they&amp;#39;re preparing the entire world</text>
  <text start="660.86" dur="8.8">for the electronic currency now what we</text>
  <text start="665.79" dur="6.66">need to do is we need to get off of the</text>
  <text start="669.66" dur="5.58">baking system electronic currency and we</text>
  <text start="672.45" dur="5.79">need to establish an electronic currency</text>
  <text start="675.24" dur="6.21">that the people control that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="678.24" dur="6.3">difference here and we don&amp;#39;t need a</text>
  <text start="681.45" dur="5.43">central bank controlling the currencies</text>
  <text start="684.54" dur="3.6">of the world actually with the crypto</text>
  <text start="686.88" dur="4.41">currency where the people control it</text>
  <text start="688.14" dur="6.42">there&amp;#39;s checks and balances because</text>

  <text start="701.52" dur="5.25">we can see right now that the dollar is</text>
  <text start="704.3" dur="4.33">collapsing I mean we see it throughout</text>
  <text start="706.77" dur="4.8">the world we see many countries using</text>
  <text start="708.63" dur="4.41">other currencies instead of the dollar</text>
  <text start="711.57" dur="4.83">and Janet Yellen</text>
  <text start="713.04" dur="6.63">well she&amp;#39;s confirmed that the US dollar</text>

  <text start="728.709" dur="4.32">going to drop hard in the coming maybe</text>
  <text start="730.87" dur="5.04">18 months or so we already see signs of</text>

  <text start="741.069" dur="6.871">lower from where the US dollar is today</text>

  <text start="765.22" dur="2.34">months now</text>
  <text start="765.85" dur="3.539">numerous Fed officials have been</text>

  <text start="773.589" dur="5.821">coordinated and clear Fed PR campaigns</text>
  <text start="776.41" dur="5.4">in recent history with many Fed</text>

  <text start="806.68" dur="6.75">the feds previous hawkish miss promptly</text>
  <text start="809.26" dur="7.829">then collapsed and all of a sudden gold</text>
  <text start="813.43" dur="6.75">erupted higher so she&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="817.089" dur="5.94">signaling and we can see that once she</text>
  <text start="820.18" dur="6.36">mentioned this that dollar pretty much</text>
  <text start="823.029" dur="6.691">took a dive so what is happening here is</text>
  <text start="826.54" dur="5.399">we see that the Fed has nowhere to go</text>
  <text start="829.72" dur="5.16">right now they can&amp;#39;t raise interest</text>
  <text start="831.939" dur="4.441">rates they can&amp;#39;t lower interest rates</text>
  <text start="834.88" dur="3.959">they have to keep everything the way it</text>
  <text start="836.38" dur="4.47">is and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the</text>
  <text start="838.839" dur="4.891">economy is continually deteriorating and</text>
  <text start="840.85" dur="5.4">I&amp;#39;m talking about the economic sectors</text>

  <text start="846.25" dur="5.37">been looking at retail we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="848.649" dur="6.69">looking at the corporate tax revenues</text>
  <text start="851.62" dur="4.44">corporate debt is on the rise and we can</text>
  <text start="855.339" dur="2.371">see that</text>
  <text start="856.06" dur="4.71">Al&amp;#39;s revenue coming into corporations</text>
  <text start="857.71" dur="4.5">well it&amp;#39;s just non-existent today we see</text>
  <text start="860.77" dur="3.57">retail well they&amp;#39;re laying off like</text>
  <text start="862.21" dur="3.68">crazy businesses are closing more and</text>
  <text start="864.34" dur="3.57">more people can&amp;#39;t find work</text>
  <text start="865.89" dur="4.48">Manufacturing is completely gone in this</text>
  <text start="867.91" dur="7.05">country and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="870.37" dur="6.51">is that everything is collapsing right</text>
  <text start="874.96" dur="4.86">in front of the Fed now the Fed yeah</text>
  <text start="876.88" dur="4.5">they realize how bad the economy really</text>
  <text start="879.82" dur="2.49">is of course they&amp;#39;re not going to admit</text>
  <text start="881.38" dur="2.34">to it they&amp;#39;re not going to come out and</text>
  <text start="882.31" dur="3.42">say hey listen everything that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="883.72" dur="3.45">done completely destroyed the economy</text>
  <text start="885.73" dur="3.63">they want you looking at the stock</text>
  <text start="887.17" dur="4.2">market look at the stock market not</text>
  <text start="889.36" dur="3.3">anywhere else and we can see at this</text>
  <text start="891.37" dur="2.55">point they have no place to go they</text>
  <text start="892.66" dur="2.64">can&amp;#39;t raise interest rates they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="893.92" dur="2.97">lower interest rates they have to pretty</text>
  <text start="895.3" dur="3.81">much keep them the way they are we saw</text>
  <text start="896.89" dur="3.72">this back prior to 2008 and they were</text>
  <text start="899.11" dur="3.27">raising the rates raising the rates</text>
  <text start="900.61" dur="4.08">raising the rates they realized they</text>
  <text start="902.38" dur="3.63">raised them too much too fast they</text>
  <text start="904.69" dur="3.57">realized what was happening in the real</text>
  <text start="906.01" dur="3.6">estate market they realized what was</text>
  <text start="908.26" dur="3.57">happening in the subprime market it</text>
  <text start="909.61" dur="4.38">realized what was happening and they</text>
  <text start="911.83" dur="5.13">stopped it and they started to lower</text>
  <text start="913.99" dur="5.7">them slowly they continually to lower</text>
  <text start="916.96" dur="5.07">them and this is where they are today</text>
  <text start="919.69" dur="4.38">where they can&amp;#39;t really lower them</text>
  <text start="922.03" dur="4.35">because that would be a sign that the</text>
  <text start="924.07" dur="4.77">Fed didn&amp;#39;t do its job and that they</text>
  <text start="926.38" dur="4.14">can&amp;#39;t raise rates so they can keep them</text>
  <text start="928.84" dur="3.84">where they are but it won&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="930.52" dur="4.68">because where they are right now and</text>
  <text start="932.68" dur="5.25">what is happening in the economy they</text>
  <text start="935.2" dur="6.03">have no way of stopping the real economy</text>
  <text start="937.93" dur="6.9">from falling apart this is the main</text>
  <text start="941.23" dur="5.61">problem and we can see as time goes on</text>
  <text start="944.83" dur="4.29">the economy is going to rip itself apart</text>
  <text start="946.84" dur="4.68">and we&amp;#39;re going to have major major</text>
  <text start="949.12" dur="3.78">problems and this is why everyone needs</text>
  <text start="951.52" dur="3.75">to be ready and prepared because when</text>
  <text start="952.9" dur="4.95">this goes down then they will have the</text>
  <text start="955.27" dur="4.83">excuse to say okay let&amp;#39;s start stimulus</text>
  <text start="957.85" dur="4.74">up again let&amp;#39;s start lowering the</text>
  <text start="960.1" dur="4.5">interest rates because of the economy</text>
  <text start="962.59" dur="3.42">completely falling apart now of course</text>
  <text start="964.6" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re not going to blame this on</text>
  <text start="966.01" dur="4.23">themselves they&amp;#39;re going to create some</text>
  <text start="968.23" dur="4.08">type of an event or an event will be</text>
  <text start="970.24" dur="4.8">created for them to point the finger at</text>
  <text start="972.31" dur="5.4">this event and this is what they&amp;#39;ll use</text>
  <text start="975.04" dur="4.68">to show why the economy is falling apart</text>
  <text start="977.71" dur="3.45">maybe they&amp;#39;ll blame it on Trump maybe</text>
  <text start="979.72" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;ll Blauman blame it on something</text>
  <text start="981.16" dur="3.75">else that happens maybe there&amp;#39;ll be a</text>
  <text start="982.84" dur="4.74">cyber attack that hits the financial</text>
  <text start="984.91" dur="4.41">system but whatever happens this will be</text>
  <text start="987.58" dur="4.56">their excuse</text>
  <text start="989.32" dur="5.04">this is what they will use at that time</text>
  <text start="992.14" dur="4.53">so this is why you need to be ready and</text>
  <text start="994.36" dur="4.92">prepared for what is coming because</text>
  <text start="996.67" dur="6">there&amp;#39;s no way out for the Fed right now</text>
  <text start="999.28" dur="5.52">because they can&amp;#39;t really control the</text>
  <text start="1002.67" dur="4.53">real economy yes the manipulated numbers</text>
  <text start="1004.8" dur="4.14">yes the creation of currency stimulus</text>
  <text start="1007.2" dur="5.49">binding bonds and all this other stuff</text>
  <text start="1008.94" dur="7.68">but they never were able to control the</text>
  <text start="1012.69" dur="6">people fully on how they used their</text>
  <text start="1016.62" dur="4.65">funds yes they can try to push people</text>
  <text start="1018.69" dur="4.5">into spending but listen when you don&amp;#39;t</text>
