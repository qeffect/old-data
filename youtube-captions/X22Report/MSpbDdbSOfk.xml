  <text start="49.629" dur="6.39">geopolitical news now I believe the</text>
  <text start="52.39" dur="7.32">year&amp;#39;s 2017 2018 when Trump first came</text>
  <text start="56.019" dur="8.61">into office and cue appeared I believe</text>
  <text start="59.71" dur="6.99">these years were meant for prepping for</text>
  <text start="64.629" dur="6.06">what is to come and what I mean by that</text>
  <text start="66.7" dur="5.94">is getting everything in place and</text>
  <text start="70.689" dur="7.29">everything that cue has been telling us</text>
  <text start="72.64" dur="9.74">back in late 2017 2018 was everything</text>
  <text start="77.979" dur="6.411">that was going to happen in 2019 2020</text>
  <text start="82.38" dur="7">moving forward</text>
  <text start="84.39" dur="7.33">remember cue and the Patriots they have</text>
  <text start="89.38" dur="5.309">this planned out now they might not be</text>
  <text start="91.72" dur="6.6">exactly exactly right on every single</text>
  <text start="94.689" dur="7.831">date but they are pretty darn close and</text>
  <text start="98.32" dur="6.899">it looks like Q and team hit their</text>
  <text start="102.52" dur="5.309">marker this time and they came very very</text>
  <text start="105.219" dur="3.481">close because they knew eventually this</text>
  <text start="107.829" dur="4.74">was going to happen</text>
  <text start="108.7" dur="5.79">they knew eventually everything that</text>
  <text start="112.569" dur="4.381">they planned out and everything that</text>
  <text start="114.49" dur="5.28">they were planning it was all gonna turn</text>
  <text start="116.95" dur="4.799">out in the way they thought I think</text>
  <text start="119.77" dur="4.5">about for the thing about the wall right</text>
  <text start="121.749" dur="5.37">now where they&amp;#39;ve been telling us all</text>
  <text start="124.27" dur="5.549">along that the wall was going to be</text>
  <text start="127.119" dur="7.291">built because of a national emergency</text>
  <text start="129.819" dur="7.14">they knew the Dems would never give so</text>
  <text start="134.41" dur="4.5">far were not seeing them give at all and</text>
  <text start="136.959" dur="5.881">they knew eventually they were going to</text>
  <text start="138.91" dur="6.51">use that and they called this because</text>
  <text start="142.84" dur="5.22">they knew that the Dems were gonna get</text>
  <text start="145.42" dur="5.67">the house they were pushing for the</text>
  <text start="148.06" dur="4.11">Senate setting up a firewall to protect</text>

  <text start="154.36" dur="5.28">Senate it would be blocked</text>
  <text start="156.52" dur="5.88">they all knew this because of planning</text>
  <text start="159.64" dur="5.13">not because they have a crystal ball not</text>
  <text start="162.4" dur="4.59">because they can tell the future because</text>
  <text start="164.77" dur="5.85">of the planning they knew if they did X</text>
  <text start="166.99" dur="6.15">Y would happen and if that didn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="170.62" dur="5.82">they would have a contingency plan and</text>
  <text start="173.14" dur="5.13">then this would happen now they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="176.44" dur="5.12">exact on every single date but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="178.27" dur="5.28">pretty darn close and we can see</text>
  <text start="181.56" dur="3.46">definite things happening and we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="499.97" dur="5.67">closer now Trump tweeted out something</text>
  <text start="502.79" dur="4.44">very interesting he tweeted out billions</text>
  <text start="505.64" dur="4.26">of dollars are sent to the state of</text>
  <text start="507.23" dur="4.56">California for forest fires that with</text>

  <text start="518.18" dur="6.42">a disgraceful situation in lives and</text>
  <text start="521.03" dur="5.22">money and we talked about the forest</text>
  <text start="524.6" dur="8.34">fires before but what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="526.25" dur="10.29">about this tweet is that forest fires</text>
  <text start="532.94" dur="7.74">or just the word forest was spelt wrong</text>
  <text start="536.54" dur="8.37">it had two R&amp;#39;s in it and then it was</text>
  <text start="540.68" dur="7.85">corrected was this a message to all an</text>

  <text start="551.86" dur="8.02">maybe maybe not</text>
  <text start="554.59" dur="7.42">but that&amp;#39;s just very coincidental now we</text>
  <text start="559.88" dur="5.46">know that Trump gave a speech about the</text>
  <text start="562.01" dur="4.83">wall on Tuesday and he said something</text>
  <text start="565.34" dur="2.79">very interesting during the speech and</text>
  <text start="566.84" dur="4.02">about the wall which we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
