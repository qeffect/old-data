  <text start="98.77" dur="5.34">his fault when the system falls apart</text>
  <text start="101.89" dur="7.53">because he didn&amp;#39;t make the China deal</text>
  <text start="104.11" dur="9.8">and today we learn that all of that is</text>
  <text start="109.42" dur="7.38">fake phony and false the New York Fed</text>
  <text start="113.91" dur="6.58">admitted that what&amp;#39;s happening with the</text>
  <text start="116.8" dur="8.97">global economy has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="120.49" dur="9.06">the tariffs with the trade deal with any</text>
  <text start="125.77" dur="6.18">of it now Trump countered this message</text>
  <text start="129.55" dur="4.95">and this is why he was at the UN saying</text>
  <text start="131.95" dur="7.05">that the globalists do not have a future</text>
  <text start="134.5" dur="7.55">in this new economy Trump is countering</text>
  <text start="139" dur="6.3">with the Moab the mother of all bombs</text>
  <text start="142.05" dur="8.01">he&amp;#39;s not just trying to renegotiate a</text>
  <text start="145.3" dur="9.019">trade deal he is preparing and ready to</text>
  <text start="150.06" dur="9.879">strip the central bank the globalists of</text>
  <text start="154.319" dur="6.911">everything and move the trade to the</text>
  <text start="159.939" dur="4.83">Americas</text>
  <text start="161.23" dur="5.759">and China there will be no negotiation</text>
  <text start="164.769" dur="6.981">of a new trade deal they will have to</text>
  <text start="166.989" dur="8.64">adapt to the new system</text>
  <text start="171.75" dur="7.06">remember the central bankers what was</text>
  <text start="175.629" dur="8.22">their plan before Trump it was to move</text>
  <text start="178.81" dur="7.679">everything to China this is why China</text>
  <text start="183.849" dur="7.17">has been built up as a manufacturing</text>
  <text start="186.489" dur="6.42">powerhouse this is why China has been</text>
  <text start="191.019" dur="5.19">receiving the secrets from the United</text>
  <text start="192.909" dur="4.951">States all of this is about to change</text>
  <text start="196.209" dur="5.31">wrong to be talking about that in just a</text>
  <text start="197.86" dur="6.749">moment but first out in the UK Boris</text>
  <text start="201.519" dur="5.671">Johnson it looks like he&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="204.609" dur="5.311">the big majority the polls are in and</text>
  <text start="207.19" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;ve done it seat by seat and the</text>
  <text start="209.92" dur="5.48">same poll that predicted Teresa may</text>
  <text start="212.47" dur="8.67">shock reverse in the 2017 snap election</text>
  <text start="215.4" dur="10.089">predicts Boris Johnson will win 68 seat</text>
  <text start="221.14" dur="6.27">majority in December now remember the</text>
  <text start="225.489" dur="5.191">central bankers when they&amp;#39;re on the</text>
  <text start="227.41" dur="6.75">losing end what do they do they push</text>
  <text start="230.68" dur="9.119">fear and what are we seeing today today</text>
  <text start="234.16" dur="8.97">we see an event in the UK pushing a</text>
  <text start="239.799" dur="6.901">terror type of an event now remember</text>
  <text start="243.13" dur="6.419">this was part of the EU of their</text>
  <text start="246.7" dur="5.759">protection of what they can do if you</text>
  <text start="249.549" dur="5.821">stay in the EU well they&amp;#39;re still part</text>
  <text start="252.459" dur="7.491">of the EU why couldn&amp;#39;t they protect the</text>
  <text start="255.37" dur="7.919">UK this is all about fear this is about</text>
  <text start="259.95" dur="6.969">convincing the people that the UK needs</text>
  <text start="263.289" dur="7.711">the EU and if you don&amp;#39;t stay with the EU</text>
  <text start="266.919" dur="7.831">gonna get a lot more of this but we know</text>
  <text start="271" dur="7.62">that the people of the UK who voted for</text>
  <text start="274.75" dur="6.96">the referendum they understand that they</text>
  <text start="278.62" dur="5.579">want to control their future Boris</text>
  <text start="281.71" dur="3.989">Johnson understands this in Trump will</text>
  <text start="284.199" dur="3.061">be meeting with Boris Johnson and</text>
  <text start="285.699" dur="4.02">already the mean mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="287.26" dur="4.74">trying to play this up saying that he</text>
  <text start="289.719" dur="4.32">might mess up the elections which is</text>
  <text start="292" dur="3.18">absolutely ridiculous</text>
  <text start="294.039" dur="4.71">but we&amp;#39;ll have to see how all that plays</text>
  <text start="295.18" dur="7.079">out but here in the United States trump</text>
  <text start="298.749" dur="6.241">is pushing the agenda with the globalist</text>
  <text start="302.259" dur="5.88">with the central bank and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="304.99" dur="6.72">interesting very quietly the New York</text>
  <text start="308.139" dur="6.78">Federal Reserve made an omission</text>
  <text start="311.71" dur="5.639">not many people notice this and it was</text>
  <text start="314.919" dur="5.4">made about two days ago in the New York</text>
  <text start="317.349" dur="5.43">Fed economic blog they admitted everyone</text>
  <text start="320.319" dur="4.71">was wrong all the financial pundits the</text>
  <text start="322.779" dur="4.47">mainstream media everyone was out there</text>
  <text start="325.029" dur="6.14">saying that tariffs were going to raise</text>
  <text start="327.249" dur="7.59">prices on consumers moon that&amp;#39;s shocking</text>
  <text start="331.169" dur="6.4">Trump&amp;#39;s 2017 tariffs against China did</text>
  <text start="334.839" dur="5.73">not lead to increased US consumer prices</text>
  <text start="337.569" dur="5.28">the Fed also said imports of the Chinese</text>
  <text start="340.569" dur="5.13">products affected by US tariffs have</text>
  <text start="342.849" dur="7.55">fallen by an annualized seventy five</text>
  <text start="345.699" dur="8.19">billion that&amp;#39;s a huge amount of business</text>
  <text start="350.399" dur="7.33">US purchasers have shifted to Japan and</text>
  <text start="353.889" dur="6.06">other Southeast Asian countries remember</text>
  <text start="357.729" dur="4.381">this was part of the plan these tariffs</text>
  <text start="359.949" dur="5.22">were to move manufacturers out of China</text>
  <text start="362.11" dur="5.359">to force business away from China if</text>
  <text start="365.169" dur="5.73">back to the United States so be it</text>
  <text start="367.469" dur="8.021">China right now is suffering a slow</text>
  <text start="370.899" dur="6.42">death by thousands of paper cuts the</text>
  <text start="375.49" dur="4.709">bleeding of cash in combination with</text>
  <text start="377.319" dur="5.31">direct loss of 75 billion and annualize</text>
  <text start="380.199" dur="4.74">exported products that the US companies</text>
  <text start="382.629" dur="6.51">have now sourced from alternative Asian</text>
  <text start="384.939" dur="7.111">Nations is biting hard and the direct</text>
  <text start="389.139" dur="4.86">outcome is also a drop in China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="392.05" dur="4.139">purchasing of industrial goods they</text>
  <text start="393.999" dur="2.73">would normally use in the manufacturing</text>
  <text start="396.189" dur="5.22">process</text>
  <text start="396.729" dur="7.141">this lack of Chinese purchasing is one</text>
  <text start="401.409" dur="5.28">of the top reasons for the stall in the</text>
  <text start="403.87" dur="5.25">European economy now this is coming out</text>
  <text start="406.689" dur="5.88">of the conservative tree house the</text>
  <text start="409.12" dur="5.879">passage of the u.s. MCA is an important</text>
  <text start="412.569" dur="5.731">next step for Trump&amp;#39;s global trade reset</text>
  <text start="414.999" dur="6.84">that&amp;#39;s right it&amp;#39;s a global trade reset</text>
  <text start="418.3" dur="5.94">so the question is what is Trump doing</text>
  <text start="421.839" dur="6.841">with the trade negotiations with China</text>
  <text start="424.24" dur="6.87">what&amp;#39;s his endgame well the current</text>
  <text start="428.68" dur="5.609">status with China was the final</text>
  <text start="431.11" dur="5.25">objective Trump looks like he&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="434.289" dur="5.671">sunning lis patient because Trump</text>
  <text start="436.36" dur="6.57">already achieved his goal when no one</text>
  <text start="439.96" dur="5.7">was paying attention were already past</text>
  <text start="442.93" dur="5.76">the success point the goal is</text>
  <text start="445.66" dur="4.89">essentially achieved there is no actual</text>
  <text start="448.69" dur="4.349">intent to reach a trade deal with China</text>
  <text start="450.55" dur="7.769">where the u.s. drops the tariffs his</text>
  <text start="453.039" dur="8.37">goal is a reset a global reset and China</text>
  <text start="458.319" dur="5.461">is going to play by his new trade rules</text>
  <text start="461.409" dur="4.771">so when Trump is saying that he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="463.78" dur="5.4">to be making a trade deal what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="466.18" dur="6.03">talking about is that China is going to</text>
  <text start="469.18" dur="7.56">have to adjust to the new economic</text>
  <text start="472.21" dur="6.63">system the walk away is exactly what</text>
  <text start="476.74" dur="4.73">Trump did when he left all those</text>
  <text start="478.84" dur="5.609">meetings in Southeast Asia in 2017 and</text>
  <text start="481.47" dur="5.59">every moment since has been setting up</text>
  <text start="484.449" dur="5.931">and firming up an entirely new global</text>
  <text start="487.06" dur="7.02">supply chain without China</text>
  <text start="490.38" dur="5.89">phase one is simply Trump negotiating</text>
  <text start="494.08" dur="3.869">the terms of a big agricultural purchase</text>
  <text start="496.27" dur="4.05">commitment from Beijing and also</text>
  <text start="497.949" dur="5.851">protecting some very specific US</text>
  <text start="500.32" dur="5.129">business interests think Apple aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="503.8" dur="3.66">they building the Mac Pro here in the</text>
  <text start="505.449" dur="4.65">United States absolutely</text>
  <text start="507.46" dur="6.59">the actual goal of Trump&amp;#39;s us-china</text>
  <text start="510.099" dur="7.521">trade reset is a complete decoupling of</text>
  <text start="514.05" dur="7.57">u.s. critical manufacturing within China</text>
  <text start="517.62" dur="7.69">now we need to remember that the central</text>
  <text start="521.62" dur="9.029">bank kissinger all those deep state</text>
  <text start="525.31" dur="7.89">players their entire agenda was to get</text>
  <text start="530.649" dur="5.491">us off the gold standard to have the</text>
  <text start="533.2" dur="6.06">petrodollar system created to run that</text>
  <text start="536.14" dur="6.68">as far as they could get it have some</text>
  <text start="539.26" dur="8.19">type of an event and move everything to</text>
  <text start="542.82" dur="9.04">China the manufacturing the financial</text>
  <text start="547.45" dur="7.16">system and restarted all that was their</text>
  <text start="551.86" dur="4.94">major plan</text>
  <text start="554.61" dur="5.099">that&amp;#39;s what they wanted to do now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="556.8" dur="6.33">very interesting is that going way back</text>
  <text start="559.709" dur="7.171">Trump met with Kissinger in the Oval</text>
  <text start="563.13" dur="6.72">Office at the White House and everyone</text>
  <text start="566.88" dur="5.43">was there saying oh see Trump he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="569.85" dur="8.01">globalist he&amp;#39;s working with Kissinger</text>
  <text start="572.31" dur="7.44">and now Kissinger is in control which I</text>
  <text start="577.86" dur="4.19">do believe and I believe I said this</text>
  <text start="579.75" dur="5.88">back then it is the complete and utter</text>
  <text start="582.05" dur="7.06">opposite and now as we can see what</text>
  <text start="585.63" dur="5.49">Trump is doing we can see why it is the</text>
  <text start="589.11" dur="3.02">opposite of what everyone was trying to</text>
  <text start="591.12" dur="3.959">tell us</text>
  <text start="592.13" dur="5.17">Trump was meeting with Kissinger to let</text>
  <text start="595.079" dur="7.171">him know that the globalist system is</text>
  <text start="597.3" dur="7.5">done this is not going any further this</text>
  <text start="602.25" dur="4.44">is why Kissinger and this he recently</text>
  <text start="604.8" dur="4.469">just said this in a November I think</text>
  <text start="606.69" dur="5.459">it&amp;#39;s 21st 2019 article he was being</text>
  <text start="609.269" dur="4.231">interviewed and at the time I was</text>
  <text start="612.149" dur="3.721">looking at it saying okay something</text>
  <text start="613.5" dur="5.279">doesn&amp;#39;t sit right with me why is he</text>
  <text start="615.87" dur="6.029">saying this because he understands what</text>
  <text start="618.779" dur="4.56">Trump is doing the IMF who&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="621.899" dur="4.8">out there saying that if Trump doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="623.339" dur="6.031">make the trade deal with China well the</text>
  <text start="626.699" dur="4.351">whole global system falls apart but the</text>
  <text start="629.37" dur="3.839">New York Fed already came out and said</text>
  <text start="631.05" dur="5.07">yeah the tariffs the trade deal has no</text>
  <text start="633.209" dur="5.761">effect on any of this stuff their system</text>
  <text start="636.12" dur="5.06">is dying all by itself now Trump is</text>
  <text start="638.97" dur="5.85">going to be making the phase 1 deal</text>
  <text start="641.18" dur="5.83">which is going to show that look what</text>
  <text start="644.82" dur="6.03">I&amp;#39;m doing here is not affecting the</text>
  <text start="647.01" dur="6.48">trade anywhere else what is affecting it</text>
  <text start="650.85" dur="4.83">is that they&amp;#39;re not stealing the funds</text>
  <text start="653.49" dur="6.12">from the United States anymore and</text>
  <text start="655.68" dur="6.269">shipping it into you Europe and when</text>
  <text start="659.61" dur="4.65">Kissinger was out there giving this</text>
  <text start="661.949" dur="5.01">interview he said the fallout from a</text>
  <text start="664.26" dur="7.41">us-china trade conflict could be even</text>
  <text start="666.959" dur="9">worse than World War 1 why would he say</text>
  <text start="671.67" dur="8.69">this why would be why would a China US</text>
  <text start="675.959" dur="7.041">trade conflict be worse than World War 1</text>
  <text start="680.36" dur="5.8">because everything that they set up</text>
  <text start="683" dur="3.94">everything that they did is going to</text>
  <text start="686.16" dur="3.09">come crashing</text>
  <text start="686.94" dur="8.49">down it will be complete and utter</text>
  <text start="689.25" dur="8.79">disaster for who for them for their</text>
  <text start="695.43" dur="4.71">system was what he said the close</text>
  <text start="698.04" dur="4.38">economic and financial ties between the</text>
  <text start="700.14" dur="5.04">US and China create potentially greater</text>
  <text start="702.42" dur="5.76">risks for America&amp;#39;s global clout if the</text>
  <text start="705.18" dur="6.51">two countries separate further remember</text>
  <text start="708.18" dur="6.12">they set this up specifically to move</text>
  <text start="711.69" dur="5.34">everything into China they were linked</text>
  <text start="714.3" dur="6.99">to shift the wealth out of the United</text>
  <text start="717.03" dur="8.16">States that is now changing and they</text>
  <text start="721.29" dur="6.45">can&amp;#39;t stop it and this is why Kissinger</text>
  <text start="725.19" dur="4.56">and the central bankers this is why</text>
  <text start="727.74" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re so worried this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="729.75" dur="4.32">worried about their globalist system</text>
  <text start="731.4" dur="4.05">this is why the IMF is out there saying</text>
  <text start="734.07" dur="3.42">if there&amp;#39;s no trade deal the whole</text>
  <text start="735.45" dur="4.05">system&amp;#39;s gonna come crashing down but</text>
  <text start="737.49" dur="5.31">what Trump and the Patriots are doing</text>
  <text start="739.5" dur="6.71">right now is they&amp;#39;re shifting everything</text>
  <text start="742.8" dur="5.88">away from them not just RINO</text>
