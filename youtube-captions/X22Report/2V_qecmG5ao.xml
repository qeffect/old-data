  <text start="38.25" dur="5.43">is September 14 2016 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="41.489" dur="3.871">the episode is the clock is ticking the</text>
  <text start="43.68" dur="5.309">control the internet will shift to a</text>
  <text start="45.36" dur="5.76">foreign power let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="48.989" dur="4.831">economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="51.12" dur="6.57">geopolitical news now we understand that</text>
  <text start="53.82" dur="6.809">the US would like to have regime change</text>
  <text start="57.69" dur="5.399">in Venezuela are pushing very hard in</text>
  <text start="60.629" dur="4.771">Venezuela they are destroying the</text>
  <text start="63.089" dur="5.431">economy there they do have the power to</text>
  <text start="65.4" dur="5.969">do that we know in Brazil they were able</text>
  <text start="68.52" dur="5.34">to get rosoff out of power and they have</text>
  <text start="71.369" dur="5.221">this new government that&amp;#39;s in place</text>
  <text start="73.86" dur="5.04">which of course is controlled by the US</text>
  <text start="76.59" dur="5.16">government we talked about this in a</text>
  <text start="78.9" dur="6.63">recent report and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="81.75" dur="6.36">this new government that Brazil has well</text>
  <text start="85.53" dur="5.21">they just announced a multi-billion</text>
  <text start="88.11" dur="7.26">dollar privatization plan an attempt to</text>
  <text start="90.74" dur="6.52">help the country out of a recession now</text>
  <text start="95.37" dur="5.76">this was part of the plane because if</text>
  <text start="97.26" dur="5.88">you notice Ukraine which was put into a</text>
  <text start="101.13" dur="5.79">huge amount of debt the economy</text>
  <text start="103.14" dur="6.18">destroyed their privatizing if you look</text>
  <text start="106.92" dur="5.22">at Greece put into a huge amount of debt</text>
  <text start="109.32" dur="5.76">the economy is destroyed they are</text>
  <text start="112.14" dur="5.7">selling off their assets and we can see</text>
  <text start="115.08" dur="5.13">that Brazil is now doing the same exact</text>
  <text start="117.84" dur="6.2">thing and it looks like they plans to</text>
  <text start="120.21" dur="8.07">auction off oil and gas electricity</text>
  <text start="124.04" dur="7.6">infrastructure projects airports at</text>
  <text start="128.28" dur="7.709">least four of them to private investors</text>
  <text start="131.64" dur="6.78">and if you notice this is happening more</text>
  <text start="135.989" dur="7.291">and more so throughout the world because</text>
  <text start="138.42" dur="9.929">what happens is the central banks they</text>
  <text start="143.28" dur="9.78">are trying to buy up the assets of these</text>
  <text start="148.349" dur="7.89">countries because what they do is they</text>
  <text start="153.06" dur="8.36">put countries into debt and they move in</text>
  <text start="156.239" dur="9.041">and they buy real assets</text>
  <text start="161.42" dur="9.84">we see that Congress has pushed through</text>
  <text start="165.28" dur="10.08">this September 11th bill that allows the</text>
  <text start="171.26" dur="6.36">American people to sue Saudi Arabia now</text>
  <text start="175.36" dur="5.5">for those people who have been looking</text>
  <text start="177.62" dur="6.81">into 911 they understand that this is</text>
  <text start="180.86" dur="6.12">absolutely ridiculous because the 911</text>
  <text start="184.43" dur="6.419">false flag was an inside job and there</text>
  <text start="186.98" dur="8.27">are many other countries involved but</text>
  <text start="190.849" dur="9.36">what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is a threat to</text>
  <text start="195.25" dur="7.98">Saudi Arabia to get in line and most</text>
  <text start="200.209" dur="5.871">likely Obama will veto this legislation</text>
  <text start="203.23" dur="5.44">they just want to show Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="206.08" dur="5.35">listen if you don&amp;#39;t do what we say</text>
  <text start="208.67" dur="5.28">you&amp;#39;re going to have millions and</text>
  <text start="211.43" dur="6.8">millions of lawsuits all over the place</text>
  <text start="213.95" dur="7.2">now Saudi Arabia is threatening the US</text>
  <text start="218.23" dur="7.81">by saying listen if you want to play</text>
  <text start="221.15" dur="8.49">this game will sell our treasury bonds</text>
  <text start="226.04" dur="5.16">are US assets and will destroy your</text>
  <text start="229.64" dur="5.46">economy now think about this for a</text>
  <text start="231.2" dur="5.25">second they know these systems coming</text>
  <text start="235.1" dur="3.18">down and when I say they it&amp;#39;s the US</text>
  <text start="236.45" dur="5.43">government central bankers they know the</text>
  <text start="238.28" dur="8.34">systems coming down and if Obama decides</text>
  <text start="241.88" dur="9.57">not to veto this bill and allows it to</text>
  <text start="246.62" dur="8.369">go through this might be a signal that</text>
  <text start="251.45" dur="6.15">they want the first part of the economy</text>
  <text start="254.989" dur="5.43">to come down because if this does happen</text>
  <text start="257.6" dur="5.34">and Saudi Arabia does sell the Treasury</text>
  <text start="260.419" dur="5.221">bonds goes ahead and sells the assets</text>
  <text start="262.94" dur="5.51">and brings the economy down they have an</text>
  <text start="265.64" dur="5.85">explanation of why they need to start QE</text>
  <text start="268.45" dur="6.279">they have an explanation of why they</text>
  <text start="271.49" dur="5.79">need to start they need to start</text>
  <text start="274.729" dur="4.351">purchasing equities they have the</text>
  <text start="277.28" dur="4.92">explanation of why they can&amp;#39;t raise</text>
  <text start="279.08" dur="5.58">interest rates and what they&amp;#39;ll do is</text>
  <text start="282.2" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;ll pump the economy up to a certain</text>
  <text start="284.66" dur="5.939">point where they say okay we have it</text>
  <text start="287.12" dur="5.07">stabilized again and they don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="290.599" dur="4.13">worry about Saudi Arabia anymore and</text>
  <text start="292.19" dur="6.949">then people can go ahead and Sue them</text>
  <text start="294.729" dur="5.97">and they&amp;#39;ve taken care of them so right</text>
  <text start="299.139" dur="5.67">now the central bank would have even</text>
  <text start="300.699" dur="6.99">more control of the system and this</text>
  <text start="304.809" dur="4.2">might be the first stage of the collapse</text>
  <text start="307.689" dur="4.98">so we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch this</text>
  <text start="309.009" dur="7.951">very carefully and see what move obama</text>
  <text start="312.669" dur="6.661">takes because we know that this system</text>
  <text start="316.96" dur="6.179">is coming down we know we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="319.33" dur="5.97">very close to the US government the</text>
  <text start="323.139" dur="4.221">central bankers we&amp;#39;re getting very close</text>
  <text start="325.3" dur="4.829">for them to do something at this point</text>
  <text start="327.36" dur="6.789">because the Middle East is a complete</text>
  <text start="330.129" dur="7.56">mess the petrodollar is doomed it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="334.149" dur="6.39">under threat right now their plans are</text>
  <text start="337.689" dur="5.241">not going the way they thought and the</text>
  <text start="340.539" dur="5.52">entire outlook does not look good and</text>
  <text start="342.93" dur="5.62">you have to remember the US government</text>
  <text start="346.059" dur="7.29">central bankers they want power their</text>
  <text start="348.55" dur="6.899">whole entire agenda is to have this one</text>
  <text start="353.349" dur="3.57">world type of government it might not be</text>
  <text start="355.449" dur="4.921">what everyone thinks it is and we</text>
  <text start="356.919" dur="5.04">discuss the isds with the TPP they just</text>
  <text start="360.37" dur="3.719">want to make sure they have control over</text>
  <text start="361.959" dur="5.101">the government&amp;#39;s they might not have</text>
  <text start="364.089" dur="5.491">just you know one person sitting at the</text>
  <text start="367.06" dur="4.169">top saying i am the government they</text>
  <text start="369.58" dur="4.679">might have the ability to control the</text>
  <text start="371.229" dur="7.02">government through other means to them</text>
  <text start="374.259" dur="7.47">that is control of the world and we can</text>
  <text start="378.249" dur="6.6">see they need to move the control the</text>
  <text start="381.729" dur="6.23">internet off to this foreign body most</text>
  <text start="384.849" dur="5.82">likely the UN and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="387.959" dur="6.82">this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="390.669" dur="6.54">because the UN would then control who</text>
  <text start="394.779" dur="4.741">has access who doesn&amp;#39;t have access what</text>
  <text start="397.209" dur="4.38">can be seen what can&amp;#39;t be seen on the</text>
  <text start="399.52" dur="6.09">internet now the vote does come up</text>
  <text start="401.589" dur="8.461">October first Congress must act to try</text>
  <text start="405.61" dur="6.51">to avert what about to happen but you</text>
  <text start="410.05" dur="5.789">have to remember this is a serious</text>
  <text start="412.12" dur="7.259">situation is most likely when this is</text>
  <text start="415.839" dur="5.91">passed to the UN they are looking to</text>
  <text start="419.379" dur="5.07">establish logins for every single person</text>
  <text start="421.749" dur="6.001">may be using biometric data and once you</text>
  <text start="424.449" dur="4.231">login they will have control of what</text>
  <text start="427.75" dur="2.97">you&amp;#39;re allowed to see</text>
  <text start="428.68" dur="5.25">what you&amp;#39;re not allowed to see they will</text>
  <text start="430.72" dur="6.27">track you and they can block things very</text>
  <text start="433.93" dur="5.37">quickly I mean think about it imagine</text>
  <text start="436.99" dur="4.59">searching the internet and instead of</text>
  <text start="439.3" dur="3.899">seeing your standard search results you</text>
  <text start="441.58" dur="3.78">see a disclaimer that the information</text>
  <text start="443.199" dur="5.451">you are searching for is censored</text>
  <text start="445.36" dur="7.98">because they have one rule fits all and</text>
  <text start="448.65" dur="6.25">this will be across the globe and we can</text>
  <text start="453.34" dur="4.699">see right now they will have total</text>
  <text start="454.9" dur="6.69">control so they&amp;#39;ll be able to control</text>
  <text start="458.039" dur="6.521">the narrative of the different stories</text>
  <text start="461.59" dur="4.59">around the world think about the United</text>
  <text start="464.56" dur="3.72">States when they&amp;#39;ve taken control of the</text>
  <text start="466.18" dur="4.32">corporate media they were able to take</text>
  <text start="468.28" dur="5.639">control of the narrative of the story</text>
  <text start="470.5" dur="5.52">and they had full control until the</text>
  <text start="473.919" dur="4.28">internet came along and then they</text>
  <text start="476.02" dur="4.86">started losing the narrative because</text>
  <text start="478.199" dur="4.75">alternative media popped up saying no</text>
  <text start="480.88" dur="5.55">this doesn&amp;#39;t seem right there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="482.949" dur="6.75">something wrong here and the facts don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="486.43" dur="4.68">fit and we can see right now this is</text>
  <text start="489.699" dur="2.851">something that they don&amp;#39;t want and this</text>
  <text start="491.11" dur="3.929">is why they continually say oh it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="492.55" dur="4.26">conspiracy there is there&amp;#39;s conspiracy</text>
  <text start="495.039" dur="4.801">here and you know and they keep making</text>
  <text start="496.81" dur="5.34">this up but most of the time I would say</text>
  <text start="499.84" dur="6.15">99 percent of the time all these</text>
  <text start="502.15" dur="4.829">conspiracies are coming true because you</text>
  <text start="505.99" dur="2.88">have to remember the corporate media</text>
  <text start="506.979" dur="3.991">they don&amp;#39;t do investigate and reporting</text>
  <text start="508.87" dur="5.43">they take what the government says and</text>
  <text start="510.97" dur="6.509">they just blurt it out there and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="514.3" dur="5.4">all they do they don&amp;#39;t question they do</text>
  <text start="517.479" dur="4.05">nothing and that&amp;#39;s what journalists are</text>
  <text start="519.7" dur="5.1">supposed to be doing questioning</text>
  <text start="521.529" dur="6.841">everything digging into what is going on</text>
  <text start="524.8" dur="4.89">and there is none of that now we</text>
  <text start="528.37" dur="3.6">understand that the United States</text>
  <text start="529.69" dur="4.83">government central bankers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="531.97" dur="4.05">provoking different countries in</text>
  <text start="534.52" dur="3.3">different regions and we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="536.02" dur="3.87">provoking China in the South China Sea</text>
  <text start="537.82" dur="3.9">we know that they&amp;#39;ve been talking to</text>
  <text start="539.89" dur="4.889">other nations like Vietnam Philippines</text>
  <text start="541.72" dur="5.369">bringing in missile systems bringing in</text>
  <text start="544.779" dur="4.951">military assets in circle in China</text>
  <text start="547.089" dur="5.791">actually Obama said it himself we are</text>
  <text start="549.73" dur="7.229">encircling China and we can see right</text>
  <text start="552.88" dur="7.52">now that the US is losing one of the</text>
  <text start="556.959" dur="5.461">countries that they spent a lot of time</text>
  <text start="560.4" dur="6.67">trying to</text>
  <text start="562.42" dur="7.52">uh help out give them aid bringing in</text>
  <text start="567.07" dur="6.69">military assets making deals with them</text>
  <text start="569.94" dur="6.339">having them sail along the US ships</text>
  <text start="573.76" dur="5.12">through the South China Sea and right</text>
  <text start="576.279" dur="5.941">now the Philippines they&amp;#39;re pulling away</text>
  <text start="578.88" dur="5.73">duterte said that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="582.22" dur="5.609">pursue independent foreign and military</text>
  <text start="584.61" dur="6.82">policies separate from the US interests</text>
  <text start="587.829" dur="7.26">in the region he ordered his defense</text>
  <text start="591.43" dur="6.32">secretary to seek weapons from China and</text>
  <text start="595.089" dur="6.571">Russia to fight drug traffickers and</text>
  <text start="597.75" dur="5.32">insurgents he also said we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="601.66" dur="4.47">stop patrolling the South trying to see</text>
  <text start="603.07" dur="6.99">alongside the US Navy because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="606.13" dur="5.91">want to upset Beijing we instead he said</text>
  <text start="610.06" dur="4.98">the nation&amp;#39;s military would focus on</text>
  <text start="612.04" dur="7.68">combating drugs and terrorism he says we</text>
  <text start="615.04" dur="8.28">don&amp;#39;t need f-16s that is no use to us we</text>
  <text start="619.72" dur="4.59">don&amp;#39;t intend to fight any country now</text>
  <text start="623.32" dur="4.139">remember the United States government</text>
  <text start="624.31" dur="6.12">central bankers they want war they want</text>
  <text start="627.459" dur="5.19">all these countries on their side this</text>
  <text start="630.43" dur="3.87">is why they&amp;#39;re giving them aid this is</text>
  <text start="632.649" dur="5.18">why they&amp;#39;re giving them military assets</text>
  <text start="634.3" dur="7.17">and we can see already their plans</text>
  <text start="637.829" dur="5.891">they&amp;#39;re not going the way they thought</text>
  <text start="641.47" dur="5.64">they were going to go and countries are</text>
  <text start="643.72" dur="5.79">pulling away now the Middle East is not</text>
  <text start="647.11" dur="4.38">going the way they thought things are</text>
  <text start="649.51" dur="4.41">rapidly deteriorating for the US</text>
  <text start="651.49" dur="4.92">government central bankers which right</text>
  <text start="653.92" dur="5.37">now should be very scary to everyone</text>
  <text start="656.41" dur="5.669">because that means we&amp;#39;re getting closer</text>
  <text start="659.29" dur="4.859">and closer to them pulling off this</text>
  <text start="662.079" dur="7.711">incredible event that&amp;#39;s going to bring</text>
  <text start="664.149" dur="8.581">us into war because once they lose the</text>
  <text start="669.79" dur="5.609">upper hand and they see that everything</text>
  <text start="672.73" dur="4.62">is a loss and there&amp;#39;s no way to come</text>
  <text start="675.399" dur="5.19">back from this the only thing left is</text>
  <text start="677.35" dur="7.28">war and this is where we&amp;#39;re headed look</text>
  <text start="680.589" dur="7.68">at Libya right now we see the other</text>
  <text start="684.63" dur="6.67">governments within Libya they&amp;#39;ve taken</text>
  <text start="688.269" dur="5.281">over the four oil ports the unity</text>

  <text start="693.55" dur="5.459">government is saying okay listen</text>
  <text start="696.339" dur="5.16">let&amp;#39;s have some talks about these ports</text>
  <text start="699.009" dur="5.221">maybe we can come up with some type of</text>
  <text start="701.499" dur="5.371">deal and of course they&amp;#39;re saying well</text>
  <text start="704.23" dur="3.87">at this point we&amp;#39;re not going to use the</text>
  <text start="706.87" dur="4.199">military we&amp;#39;re going to use the</text>
  <text start="708.1" dur="5.549">political angle and we know the</text>
  <text start="711.069" dur="6.481">political angle is not going to work we</text>
  <text start="713.649" dur="6.451">know this is a period of time where the</text>
  <text start="717.55" dur="5.61">u.s. the coalition forces they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="737.17" dur="5.279">to create chaos in the country to give</text>
  <text start="740.199" dur="5.971">them an excuse to go into the country</text>
  <text start="742.449" dur="5.791">and to bring in military assets they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="746.17" dur="5.01">done this in Iraq they&amp;#39;ve done this in</text>
  <text start="748.24" dur="4.289">Syria even though they invaded Syria</text>
  <text start="751.18" dur="3.389">it&amp;#39;s a sovereign country that in his</text>
  <text start="752.529" dur="4.441">permission to go in there didn&amp;#39;t ask</text>
  <text start="754.569" dur="4.801">permission to go into Libya either but</text>
  <text start="756.97" dur="7.799">we can see right now they are losing</text>
  <text start="759.37" dur="8.399">control in all of these areas and again</text>
  <text start="764.769" dur="6.451">the clock is ticking down the economy is</text>
  <text start="767.769" dur="6.24">not going to last yes the central bank</text>
  <text start="771.22" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re trying to push Congress for more</text>
  <text start="774.009" dur="4.711">legislation to have give them more</text>
  <text start="775.66" dur="6.06">control but that takes timing doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="778.72" dur="5.13">happen overnight the only way they can</text>
  <text start="781.72" dur="5.849">get those things through is with some</text>
  <text start="783.85" dur="7.919">type of an event with maybe with Saudi</text>
  <text start="787.569" dur="9.541">Arabia like we said before so they can</text>
  <text start="791.769" dur="10.23">have that on the ready we see right now</text>
  <text start="797.11" dur="7.139">in Syria that US airstrikes they may</text>
  <text start="801.999" dur="4.5">have killed some more civilians this is</text>
  <text start="804.249" dur="4.411">coming from the Pentagon and it&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="806.499" dur="4.5">because when you think back in time they</text>
  <text start="808.66" dur="3.989">continually said Assad was killing the</text>
  <text start="810.999" dur="4.26">civilians now the Pentagon is coming out</text>
  <text start="812.649" dur="4.92">saying yes we have three separate US</text>
  <text start="815.259" dur="4.08">airstrikes over the past week and we</text>
  <text start="817.569" dur="3.841">might have killed a lot of civilians</text>
  <text start="819.339" dur="4.261">their women and children but it&amp;#39;s okay</text>
  <text start="821.41" dur="4.38">if the u.s. does it of course they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="823.6" dur="4.739">a country that they&amp;#39;re not supposed to</text>
  <text start="825.79" dur="4.2">be in they invaded a country the United</text>
  <text start="828.339" dur="4.981">States is killing the civilian</text>
  <text start="829.99" dur="6.719">in that country and it looks like what</text>
  <text start="833.32" dur="6.6">they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="836.709" dur="6.781">around and bombing all the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="839.92" dur="6.14">areas now of course the the individuals</text>
  <text start="843.49" dur="6.659">of the Islamic state have left that area</text>
  <text start="846.06" dur="8.589">but it seems like they&amp;#39;re destroying the</text>
  <text start="850.149" dur="8.371">evidence in all of these areas bombing</text>
  <text start="854.649" dur="6.481">like crazy and they&amp;#39;re rushing as fast</text>
  <text start="858.52" dur="5.069">as they can to erase the evidence of</text>
  <text start="861.13" dur="4.769">their own complicity and financing and</text>
  <text start="863.589" dur="5.101">training of the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="865.899" dur="5.94">mercenaries it&amp;#39;s a cleanup job right now</text>
  <text start="868.69" dur="5.85">because they know Syria and Russia they</text>
  <text start="871.839" dur="6.111">have the upper hand the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="874.54" dur="5.76">done actually the u.s. is done in Syria</text>
  <text start="877.95" dur="5.079">there&amp;#39;s nothing left for them to do</text>
  <text start="880.3" dur="6.42">there except leave but they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="883.029" dur="6.93">to because their goal is still to get</text>
  <text start="886.72" dur="7.5">Assad and go into Iran they will never</text>
  <text start="889.959" dur="6.591">give up we can see out in Syria when</text>
  <text start="894.22" dur="6.39">Israel flew in and tried to attack in</text>
  <text start="896.55" dur="6.76">the the Golan height area the Syrians</text>
  <text start="900.61" dur="5.4">had the s200 air defense system which</text>
  <text start="903.31" dur="6">brought down the Israeli plane and again</text>
  <text start="906.01" dur="10.11">Israel has no business flying into this</text>
  <text start="909.31" dur="12.029">area and destroying and attacking the</text>
  <text start="916.12" dur="9.18">Syrians but we can see right now this is</text>
  <text start="921.339" dur="9.081">all part of the coalition&amp;#39;s plan now</text>
  <text start="925.3" dur="10.05">Kerry is out there saying that they have</text>
  <text start="930.42" dur="6.88">different ways we find ways to separate</text>
  <text start="935.35" dur="6.239">the moderate opposition from al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="937.3" dur="6.96">and there&amp;#39;s a condition on this the</text>
  <text start="941.589" dur="5.211">Syrian opposition will not separate</text>
  <text start="944.26" dur="8.449">itself from nusrah front elements if</text>
  <text start="946.8" dur="10.659">Damascus or Russia violate the ceasefire</text>
  <text start="952.709" dur="7.721">so all they have to do is say Russia and</text>
  <text start="957.459" dur="6.061">Syria violated the ceasefire we are not</text>
  <text start="960.43" dur="7.2">separating and we can see this happening</text>
  <text start="963.52" dur="7.83">right off the bat and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="967.63" dur="6.06">watch this situation as it moves forward</text>
  <text start="971.35" dur="4.92">because we can see already Russia is</text>
  <text start="973.69" dur="5.49">calling for a 48-hour extension to the</text>
  <text start="976.27" dur="4.38">ceasefire you have to remember the</text>
  <text start="979.18" dur="3.21">moderate rebels the largest group</text>
  <text start="980.65" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re not going along with the</text>
  <text start="982.39" dur="4.74">ceasefire right now so we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="985.78" dur="3.09">have to watch this and it looks like</text>
  <text start="987.13" dur="3.81">Russia is putting a lot of pressure on</text>
  <text start="988.87" dur="6.9">the United States to get their</text>
  <text start="990.94" dur="8.31">terrorists in line and Russia is saying</text>
  <text start="995.77" dur="5.43">listen we talked with the u.s. we came</text>
  <text start="999.25" dur="5.33">up with this deal we wanted to put</text>
  <text start="1001.2" dur="5.7">everything out on the table and the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1004.58" dur="5.89">decided that they don&amp;#39;t want to reveal</text>
  <text start="1006.9" dur="5.04">sensitive issues to the ceasefire deal</text>
  <text start="1010.47" dur="3.54">now of course we all know what that is</text>
  <text start="1011.94" dur="4.26">we all know they don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="1014.01" dur="5.7">information coming out that al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="1016.2" dur="5.25">al-nusrah the rebranded al-qaeda it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1019.71" dur="5.49">all part of their network and the</text>
  <text start="1021.45" dur="5.88">moderate rebels really don&amp;#39;t exist so we</text>
  <text start="1025.2" dur="4.56">can see right now this entire agreement</text>
  <text start="1027.33" dur="5.43">which is five separate documents it</text>
  <text start="1029.76" dur="6.69">won&amp;#39;t be published it&amp;#39;s going to be kept</text>
  <text start="1032.76" dur="8.3">in the dark justwe just the way the US</text>
  <text start="1036.45" dur="7.44">likes it now we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="1041.06" dur="6.73">that the United States government</text>
  <text start="1043.89" dur="8.37">central bankers their system their</text>
  <text start="1047.79" dur="8.97">petrol dollar system is coming to its</text>
  <text start="1052.26" dur="6.66">end game right now they&amp;#39;ve lost control</text>
  <text start="1056.76" dur="5.19">the Middle East it&amp;#39;s getting worse as</text>
  <text start="1058.92" dur="5.7">time goes on they&amp;#39;re losing control in</text>
  <text start="1061.95" dur="6.27">the South China Sea already one country</text>
  <text start="1064.62" dur="8.76">is pulling away and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="1068.22" dur="7.26">that they&amp;#39;re running out of time and we</text>
  <text start="1073.38" dur="5.88">can see as we approach the election</text>
  <text start="1075.48" dur="6.6">period that is also not going the way</text>
  <text start="1079.26" dur="6.75">they want the candidate that they are</text>
  <text start="1082.08" dur="7.35">shooting for looks like she&amp;#39;s having</text>
  <text start="1086.01" dur="7.8">problems so if we put all of this</text>
  <text start="1089.43" dur="5.52">together I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised from</text>
  <text start="1093.81" dur="2.34">all these different indicators that</text>
  <text start="1094.95" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="1096.15" dur="4.95">I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="1099.15" dur="3.48">type of an event now what that events</text>
  <text start="1101.1" dur="4.17">going to be we don&amp;#39;t know we mentioned</text>
  <text start="1102.63" dur="4.98">the one with Saudi Arabia we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="1105.27" dur="4.44">watch that because that would explain</text>
  <text start="1107.61" dur="4.16">away why they need to push all this</text>
  <text start="1109.71" dur="4.89">legislation through very very quickly to</text>
  <text start="1111.77" dur="5.74">recover the economy which allows the</text>
  <text start="1114.6" dur="5.49">central bank to take full control of the</text>
  <text start="1117.51" dur="4.32">system because right now they they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1120.09" dur="4.38">have full control they don&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s not in</text>
  <text start="1121.83" dur="7.41">their mandate to buy equities they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1124.47" dur="6.87">do what they want to do and having Saudi</text>
  <text start="1129.24" dur="4.5">Arabia sell the assets sell the Treasury</text>
  <text start="1131.34" dur="5.55">bring down the economy it would allow</text>
  <text start="1133.74" dur="6.09">the Federal Reserve to do this very</text>
  <text start="1136.89" dur="5.16">quickly plus they can explain away why</text>
  <text start="1139.83" dur="3.87">the economy is failing and that is the</text>
  <text start="1142.05" dur="3.54">first part of the economy failing</text>
  <text start="1143.7" dur="4.26">because they&amp;#39;re just going to pump up</text>
  <text start="1145.59" dur="4.4">the illusion and people think that it</text>
  <text start="1147.96" dur="5.45">will be fixed but it really won&amp;#39;t be and</text>
  <text start="1149.99" dur="5.71">then they can move to the second phase</text>
  <text start="1153.41" dur="5.47">where they need to get us into war to</text>
  <text start="1155.7" dur="6.66">cover up the big disaster because you</text>
  <text start="1158.88" dur="7.82">know once this starts it&amp;#39;s like a domino</text>
  <text start="1162.36" dur="7.62">effect all of a sudden derivatives bonds</text>
  <text start="1166.7" dur="5.26">stocks things going to rapidly fall</text>
  <text start="1169.98" dur="4.29">apart they&amp;#39;re going to have to create</text>
  <text start="1171.96" dur="5.55">more and more funds the debts going to</text>
  <text start="1174.27" dur="6.63">rise I mean dramatically worse than</text>
  <text start="1177.51" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;re even seeing now we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1180.9" dur="3.81">start to see inflation because other</text>
  <text start="1182.37" dur="3.72">countries around the world are going to</text>
  <text start="1184.71" dur="2.91">be selling their oil not using the</text>
  <text start="1186.09" dur="4.2">dollar reserves are going to be coming</text>
  <text start="1187.62" dur="6.39">back to the US so we can see this</text>
  <text start="1190.29" dur="5.81">situation it&amp;#39;s escalating and it looks</text>
  <text start="1194.01" dur="5.82">like we&amp;#39;re getting to that time period</text>
  <text start="1196.1" dur="6.73">where we might see something big happen</text>
  <text start="1199.83" dur="6.66">and all of this is not to be negative</text>
  <text start="1202.83" dur="6">it&amp;#39;s not to scare people we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
