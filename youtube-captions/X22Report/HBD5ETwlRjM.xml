  <text start="125.59" dur="4.709">and they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us and</text>
  <text start="128.259" dur="4.501">they think we&amp;#39;re actually stupid where</text>
  <text start="130.299" dur="3.631">we believe that of course when Obama</text>

  <text start="133.93" dur="4.259">governmental leaders across the world</text>
  <text start="136.029" dur="4.11">they come out and they tell us that we</text>
  <text start="138.189" dur="3.111">are in a recovery you just need to</text>
  <text start="140.139" dur="4.771">believe</text>
  <text start="141.3" dur="4.99">the people in France they had it with</text>

  <text start="153.37" dur="5.16">leaders they&amp;#39;re out there telling us</text>
  <text start="155.05" dur="4.62">that yes we are in a recovery don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="158.53" dur="3.96">worry about it</text>
  <text start="159.67" dur="4.56">things will get better in Greece they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="162.49" dur="5.52">told it they told them this what for the</text>
  <text start="164.23" dur="6.06">last five to six years and guess what</text>
  <text start="168.01" dur="6.87">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing the actual opposite</text>
  <text start="170.29" dur="6.66">now in the UK the people there the young</text>
  <text start="174.88" dur="5.4">people in the UK are feeling stressed</text>
  <text start="176.95" dur="6.42">and depressed according to the Prince&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="180.28" dur="5.61">Trust Youth index report one-third of</text>
  <text start="183.37" dur="5.28">unemployed young people aged 16 to 25</text>
  <text start="185.89" dur="5.46">fall apart emotionally and tend to feel</text>
  <text start="188.65" dur="5.16">isolated during their mission to find a</text>
  <text start="191.35" dur="5.13">full-time job this is what the report is</text>
  <text start="193.81" dur="4.89">saying that they cannot find full-time</text>
  <text start="196.48" dur="4.82">work and they start to fall apart why is</text>
  <text start="198.7" dur="5.31">this happening to me I went to school I</text>
  <text start="201.3" dur="4.81">had good grades and I can&amp;#39;t find this</text>
  <text start="204.01" dur="3.81">high paying job the same things</text>
  <text start="206.11" dur="5.129">happening here in the United States this</text>
  <text start="207.82" dur="6.18">report reveals that one in ten</text>
  <text start="211.239" dur="5.881">unemployed young people feel anxious and</text>
  <text start="214" dur="5.79">uncomfortable while 46 percent avoid</text>
  <text start="217.12" dur="4.14">going outside and I can see this here</text>
  <text start="219.79" dur="3.39">also in the United States</text>
  <text start="221.26" dur="4.83">where we see a lot of college graduates</text>
  <text start="223.18" dur="4.86">and we have to remember those students</text>
  <text start="226.09" dur="3.24">those young people that are going to</text>
  <text start="228.04" dur="2.699">school they think they&amp;#39;re gonna just</text>
  <text start="229.33" dur="2.67">come out and find a job because this is</text>
  <text start="230.739" dur="4.651">what they&amp;#39;ve been brainwashed to think</text>
  <text start="232" dur="5.76">that if you go to college and you study</text>
  <text start="235.39" dur="4.92">hard you will come out and find a great</text>
  <text start="237.76" dur="5.13">job well I know many many people</text>
  <text start="240.31" dur="5.1">actually a lot of my relatives who are</text>
  <text start="242.89" dur="4.71">now graduating college who have</text>
  <text start="245.41" dur="6.049">graduated already and I know a lot of</text>
  <text start="247.6" dur="7.05">friends they cannot find full-time work</text>
  <text start="251.459" dur="6.611">period so they have to take a part-time</text>
  <text start="254.65" dur="6.869">job and that wasn&amp;#39;t easy to get there</text>
  <text start="258.07" dur="6.33">were so many applicants to these jobs it</text>
  <text start="261.519" dur="6.031">was very difficult sometimes they went 5</text>
  <text start="264.4" dur="6.06">6 7 8 months until they actually found</text>
  <text start="267.55" dur="4.679">something and this is a part-time job</text>
  <text start="270.46" dur="4.15">they can&amp;#39;t even move out of their</text>
  <text start="272.229" dur="6.701">parents house they barely afford pay</text>
  <text start="274.61" dur="6.839">their student loans now the government</text>
  <text start="278.93" dur="4.139">here in the United States as we know</text>
  <text start="281.449" dur="3.87">suppress the oil prices because they</text>
  <text start="283.069" dur="4.081">realized as we approach the holiday</text>
  <text start="285.319" dur="5.1">season that this holiday season was</text>
  <text start="287.15" dur="5.039">going to be a disaster and they knew it</text>
  <text start="290.419" dur="3.12">and they needed to do something and this</text>
  <text start="292.189" dur="3">was part of their agenda as they</text>
  <text start="293.539" dur="4.44">suppress oil prices because they thought</text>
  <text start="295.189" dur="4.47">well you know what we&amp;#39;ll do all those</text>
  <text start="297.979" dur="3.69">people have been complaining and</text>
  <text start="299.659" dur="3.451">everything like that we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll get we</text>
  <text start="301.669" dur="3.331">will give them extra money in their</text>
  <text start="303.11" dur="3.839">pockets and now they&amp;#39;ll feel a little</text>
  <text start="305" dur="4.68">bit better and they&amp;#39;ll go out and spend</text>
  <text start="306.949" dur="4.71">it during Christmas but these people are</text>
  <text start="309.68" dur="5.039">so detached on what&amp;#39;s really going on</text>
  <text start="311.659" dur="5.31">they have no idea that the people are</text>
  <text start="314.719" dur="4.741">looking at this and saying no I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="316.969" dur="4.32">to keep this money because I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="319.46" dur="4.199">when these prices are gonna go back up</text>
  <text start="321.289" dur="6.12">and I really don&amp;#39;t have extra right now</text>
  <text start="323.659" dur="7.051">and it is starting to show like I said</text>
  <text start="327.409" dur="6.32">in my previous reports US retail sales</text>
  <text start="330.71" dur="5.819">dropped a stunning 0.9% month-on-month</text>
  <text start="333.729" dur="6.071">massively missing expectations of 0.1</text>
  <text start="336.529" dur="6.531">percent drop the last time we saw a</text>
  <text start="339.8" dur="5.91">bigger monthly drop was in June 2012</text>
  <text start="343.06" dur="4.779">now the government the corporate media</text>
  <text start="345.71" dur="4.919">it&amp;#39;s amazing how they spin all as well</text>
  <text start="347.839" dur="6.661">the reason why retail is down is because</text>
  <text start="350.629" dur="5.91">oil prices are very very low and this is</text>
  <text start="354.5" dur="4.65">what dragged it right down</text>
  <text start="356.539" dur="5.13">of course now they&amp;#39;re using this as the</text>
  <text start="359.15" dur="4.56">excuse before Obama was out there saying</text>
  <text start="361.669" dur="3.12">ah lower oil prices are good for the</text>
  <text start="363.71" dur="1.739">economy it&amp;#39;s gonna be great for this</text>
  <text start="364.789" dur="1.74">holiday season</text>
  <text start="365.449" dur="3.96">people are gonna go out there and</text>
  <text start="366.529" dur="6.69">purchase like they&amp;#39;ve never done before</text>
  <text start="369.409" dur="6.091">but guess what it didn&amp;#39;t happen and now</text>
  <text start="373.219" dur="6.271">they&amp;#39;re spinning it saying ah the reason</text>
  <text start="375.5" dur="7.229">for this is the oil prices so let&amp;#39;s do</text>
  <text start="379.49" dur="5.729">something let&amp;#39;s remove the oil prices as</text>
  <text start="382.729" dur="4.951">they say is the cause of this let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="385.219" dur="4.98">remove autos from this and let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="387.68" dur="6.769">look at the retail sales</text>
  <text start="390.199" dur="8.541">well the retail sales fell by 0.3%</text>
  <text start="394.449" dur="9.76">missing expectations of a positive 0.5%</text>
  <text start="398.74" dur="8.94">so already they&amp;#39;re lying to us we have</text>
  <text start="404.209" dur="7.641">to remember this is</text>
  <text start="407.68" dur="9.2">not good this is the busiest season of</text>
  <text start="411.85" dur="9.539">the entire year this is where retailers</text>
  <text start="416.88" dur="8.89">get their income get the money to</text>
  <text start="421.389" dur="6.15">survive the rest of the year what do you</text>
  <text start="425.77" dur="5.399">think is going to happen and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="427.539" dur="6.991">already seen it stores are closing</text>
  <text start="431.169" dur="5.22">people are being laid off let&amp;#39;s break it</text>
  <text start="434.53" dur="4.32">down and let&amp;#39;s see something well when</text>
  <text start="436.389" dur="7.441">we break it down we see sales decline in</text>
  <text start="438.85" dur="6.98">9 out of 13 major categories let&amp;#39;s take</text>
  <text start="443.83" dur="4.23">a look let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s dive into this</text>
  <text start="445.83" dur="6.429">electronics and appliances down at</text>
  <text start="448.06" dur="9.12">negative 1.6% building material garden</text>
  <text start="452.259" dur="6.72">supplies negative 1.9 percent of course</text>
  <text start="457.18" dur="3.9">gasoline stations as prices came down</text>
  <text start="458.979" dur="4.021">its negative 6.5 percent but we know</text>
  <text start="461.08" dur="5.22">this is not the cause because we</text>
  <text start="463" dur="6.38">stripped it out clothing stores and</text>
  <text start="466.3" dur="5.94">clothing accessories negative 0.3%</text>
  <text start="469.38" dur="4.96">Sporting Goods hobbies books music</text>
  <text start="472.24" dur="6.5">stores negative 0.2% general merchandise</text>
  <text start="474.34" dur="7.77">departments or its negative 0.9%</text>
  <text start="478.74" dur="6.58">miscellaneous retailers negative 1.9</text>
  <text start="482.11" dur="6.63">percent so what are we seeing here we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="485.32" dur="5.4">seeing a complete implosion of retail</text>
  <text start="488.74" dur="3.09">and of course the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="490.72" dur="4.259">government&amp;#39;s out there say this is a</text>
  <text start="491.83" dur="6.809">blip it&amp;#39;s the oil prices that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="494.979" dur="6.651">causing all of this well if that is true</text>
  <text start="498.639" dur="5.541">and this is the busiest time of the year</text>
  <text start="501.63" dur="5.259">what in the world is going to happen</text>
  <text start="504.18" dur="4.9">January February March April and the</text>
  <text start="506.889" dur="5.221">rest of this year because the department</text>
  <text start="509.08" dur="6.209">stores the retailers they depend on this</text>
  <text start="512.11" dur="4.59">time of year to survive well guess what</text>
  <text start="515.289" dur="4.261">they&amp;#39;re gonna do they&amp;#39;re gonna start</text>
  <text start="516.7" dur="6.389">closing their stores we are going to see</text>
  <text start="519.55" dur="6.57">in shopping malls across America they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="586.24" dur="4.05">gonna see a lot of store closures but we</text>
  <text start="588.999" dur="3.661">have to think about this a little bit</text>
  <text start="590.29" dur="4.169">further think about those people who</text>
  <text start="592.66" dur="4.169">worked in these stores now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="594.459" dur="3.841">without jobs there will be more</text>
  <text start="596.829" dur="4.38">competition for the smaller number of</text>
  <text start="598.3" dur="5.099">jobs in America and many people will not</text>
  <text start="601.209" dur="4.831">be able to find work we&amp;#39;ll see an</text>
  <text start="603.399" dur="4.92">increase in foreclosures repossessions</text>
  <text start="606.04" dur="3.269">in welfare as they cannot find work and</text>
  <text start="608.319" dur="3.031">a lot of these people who have been</text>
  <text start="609.309" dur="3.96">part-time jobs they don&amp;#39;t meet the</text>
  <text start="611.35" dur="3.419">requirements of many states where they</text>

  <text start="619.509" dur="4.86">unemployment it&amp;#39;s even worse for them</text>
  <text start="621.939" dur="4.26">now think about all those people who</text>
  <text start="624.369" dur="3.21">provided the inventory for these stores</text>
  <text start="626.199" dur="3.541">think about those people that</text>
  <text start="627.579" dur="4.2">distributed the merchandise to all of</text>
  <text start="629.74" dur="4.05">these stores most businesses work on a</text>
