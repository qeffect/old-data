  <text start="132.68" dur="4.1">are following well they&amp;#39;re all flashing</text>
  <text start="135.049" dur="4.981">red and many of the indicators already</text>

  <text start="140.03" dur="4.37">are either in a recession or we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="142.22" dur="5.34">headed towards a major major collapse</text>

  <text start="149.66" dur="5.73">retail or any of the manipulated numbers</text>
  <text start="152.9" dur="5.01">we can see that yeah things aren&amp;#39;t as</text>
  <text start="155.39" dur="4.52">good as they are broadcasting if we look</text>
  <text start="157.91" dur="5.16">at commercial real estate for instance</text>
  <text start="159.91" dur="6.31">commercial real estate loans at banks in</text>

  <text start="177.079" dur="6.151">before it imploded during the financial</text>
  <text start="178.94" dur="6.479">crisis now in CRE leverage is everything</text>
  <text start="183.23" dur="3.81">banks particularly small regional banks</text>
  <text start="185.419" dur="4.591">that specialize in it are</text>
  <text start="187.04" dur="5.46">on the hook the Fed governors have</text>
  <text start="190.01" dur="5.309">pointed at the CRE as one of the places</text>
  <text start="192.5" dur="5.76">where elevated prices threatened</text>
  <text start="195.319" dur="5.551">financial stability because of leverage</text>
  <text start="198.26" dur="5.94">and the connection to the banks now CRE</text>
  <text start="200.87" dur="4.709">loans were in part responsible for the</text>
  <text start="204.2" dur="4.02">near collapse of the financial system</text>
  <text start="205.579" dur="4.891">during the financial crisis after CRE</text>

  <text start="210.47" dur="6.87">those loans turned down commercial real</text>
  <text start="213.859" dur="6.66">estate prices collapsed nearly 40</text>
  <text start="217.34" dur="4.319">percent during the financial crisis now</text>

  <text start="221.659" dur="7.561">commercial property price index the CPI</text>
  <text start="225.579" dur="6.731">prices more than doubled from the low in</text>
  <text start="229.22" dur="5.909">May of 2009 and peaked in September of</text>
  <text start="232.31" dur="4.53">2017 when the index was around 27</text>
  <text start="235.129" dur="5.071">percent above the crazy peak of the</text>
  <text start="236.84" dur="7.41">prior bubble but since September 2017</text>
  <text start="240.2" dur="6">the index has dropped by 1.7 percent</text>
  <text start="244.25" dur="4.409">including the one percent drop in March</text>
  <text start="246.2" dur="4.92">from February it is now down 2.1 percent</text>
  <text start="248.659" dur="6.271">from march last year and back where had</text>
  <text start="251.12" dur="4.38">been in May 2016 now we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="254.93" dur="4.04">before</text>
  <text start="255.5" dur="7.43">were the commercial property price index</text>
  <text start="258.97" dur="8.14">was shooting up and then it leveled off</text>
  <text start="262.93" dur="7.66">started to decline and then it pretty</text>
  <text start="267.11" dur="8.58">much imploded if we go back to September</text>
  <text start="270.59" dur="7.199">of 2007 the index hit a hundred and then</text>
  <text start="275.69" dur="7.32">it went south all the way down to 61</text>
  <text start="277.789" dur="10.951">point two by May of 2009 May of 2016 we</text>
  <text start="283.01" dur="8.76">are now at about 125 and it&amp;#39;s starting</text>
  <text start="288.74" dur="5.76">to fall and it looks like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="291.77" dur="4.95">following the same exact path as we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="294.5" dur="4.65">done once before during the financial</text>
  <text start="296.72" dur="5.819">crisis and this is not going to turn out</text>
  <text start="299.15" dur="6.81">very well now when we look at this and</text>
  <text start="302.539" dur="6.391">we look at the different types of real</text>
  <text start="305.96" dur="6.54">estate we can see that things really</text>
  <text start="308.93" dur="6.209">don&amp;#39;t look good for lodging because</text>
  <text start="312.5" dur="6.15">during the financial crisis the air B&amp;amp;B</text>
  <text start="315.139" dur="5.791">it took a big dive and it has never</text>
  <text start="318.65" dur="4.109">recovered offices</text>
  <text start="320.93" dur="4.23">index dropped a steep two percent in</text>
  <text start="322.759" dur="4.681">March from February and is now down 1%</text>
  <text start="325.16" dur="4.53">from March a year ago retail well this</text>
  <text start="327.44" dur="3.87">is where the biggest issues are the sex</text>
  <text start="329.69" dur="4.319">stir the sector can be split into two</text>
  <text start="331.31" dur="5.04">categories strip malls and malls the sub</text>
  <text start="334.009" dur="3.931">index for strip malls dropped 5% in</text>
  <text start="336.35" dur="4.379">March compared to March last year it</text>
  <text start="337.94" dur="6.3">peaked at the end of 2016 and has since</text>
  <text start="340.729" dur="6.211">dropped by 8% the sub index from malls</text>
  <text start="344.24" dur="5.549">dropped 14% over the past 12 months</text>
  <text start="346.94" dur="5.009">after plunging 5% in just one month</text>
  <text start="349.789" dur="5.071">now these price declines in the retail</text>
  <text start="351.949" dur="5.97">sector are starting to coalesce into a</text>
  <text start="354.86" dur="6.059">serious move and it&amp;#39;s just the beginning</text>
  <text start="357.919" dur="4.801">the mall sector will provide ample pain</text>
  <text start="360.919" dur="3.78">to lenders and holders of commercial</text>
  <text start="362.72" dur="4.64">mortgage-backed securities as this</text>
  <text start="364.699" dur="7.47">washes out over the next few years so</text>
  <text start="367.36" dur="7.869">this is another indicator now at GM we</text>
  <text start="372.169" dur="5.34">can see that sales aren&amp;#39;t going as well</text>
  <text start="375.229" dur="4.861">as they thought the Cruze the Chevy</text>
  <text start="377.509" dur="5.431">Cruze compact car is not selling well</text>
  <text start="380.09" dur="5.85">very well and we understand that this is</text>
  <text start="382.94" dur="5.13">going to lead to layoffs now the GM</text>
  <text start="385.94" dur="3.71">plant in Lordstown Ohio which only</text>
  <text start="388.07" dur="4.349">builds the chevy cruze compact car</text>
  <text start="389.65" dur="4.6">already went through layoffs in 2017</text>
  <text start="392.419" dur="3.99">when it trimmed its three shifts to two</text>
  <text start="394.25" dur="5.159">shifts and cut about 1,200 workers due</text>
  <text start="396.409" dur="5.971">to what GM said at the time was a change</text>
  <text start="399.409" dur="5.94">in consumer preference from cars to SUVs</text>
  <text start="402.38" dur="5.009">crossovers and pickups these cuts</text>
  <text start="405.349" dur="4.13">brought the workforce at the Lordstown</text>
  <text start="407.389" dur="5.191">plant down to about 3,000 employees</text>
  <text start="409.479" dur="4.81">2,700 hourly and 300 salaried now the</text>
  <text start="412.58" dur="4.53">number is going to get cut in half</text>
  <text start="414.289" dur="4.681">approximately 1500 positions will be</text>
  <text start="417.11" dur="3.869">eliminated we have to remember the</text>
  <text start="418.97" dur="4.169">delinquency rate in subprime auto loans</text>
  <text start="420.979" dur="5.881">have soared to the worst level since</text>
  <text start="423.139" dur="6.421">1996 the first three specialized small</text>
  <text start="426.86" dur="4.339">lenders have already collapsed think</text>
  <text start="429.56" dur="4.46">about what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="431.199" dur="5.801">everything is starting to reverse</text>
  <text start="434.02" dur="5.5">remember the central banks they build</text>
  <text start="437" dur="5.25">the bubbles up they keep blowing them up</text>
  <text start="439.52" dur="4.98">until they can&amp;#39;t do it anymore and there</text>
  <text start="442.25" dur="4.68">were at that point where they blown</text>
  <text start="444.5" dur="4.38">these bubbles up and now everything is</text>
  <text start="446.93" dur="4.049">starting to deflate and what happens is</text>
  <text start="448.88" dur="4.289">these bubbles will lose air very very</text>
  <text start="450.979" dur="3.451">quickly and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="453.169" dur="3.181">happen right now</text>
  <text start="454.43" dur="2.97">because when we look at all the economic</text>
  <text start="456.35" dur="3.18">indicators we look at all different</text>
  <text start="457.4" dur="4.89">sectors we can see that things are</text>
  <text start="459.53" dur="4.53">rapidly falling apart and everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="462.29" dur="3.21">trying to explain why all this is</text>
  <text start="464.06" dur="3.87">happening just like they tried to</text>
  <text start="465.5" dur="3.6">explain why retail wasn&amp;#39;t doing as well</text>
  <text start="467.93" dur="3.66">and I know there&amp;#39;s a report out there</text>
  <text start="469.1" dur="6.21">saying that retail is back retail is not</text>
  <text start="471.59" dur="6.329">back it&amp;#39;s still declining it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="475.31" dur="4.139">improving and this is what they do to</text>
  <text start="477.919" dur="3.78">make you think that everything is</text>
  <text start="479.449" dur="5.041">fantastic and you&amp;#39;ll see as we move</text>
  <text start="481.699" dur="5.041">towards the holiday season of this year</text>
  <text start="484.49" dur="4.61">it&amp;#39;s going to be even worse that&amp;#39;s if</text>
  <text start="486.74" dur="6.239">the whole system doesn&amp;#39;t come down and</text>
  <text start="489.1" dur="7.03">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a huge push to</text>
  <text start="492.979" dur="6.201">bring the entire system down now why do</text>
  <text start="496.13" dur="5.22">why do we need to bring down the system</text>
  <text start="499.18" dur="4.989">well we&amp;#39;ve explained this many many</text>
  <text start="501.35" dur="4.89">times this is a central banking system</text>
  <text start="504.169" dur="4.711">this is not a system for the people it</text>
  <text start="506.24" dur="5.19">is a system for the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="508.88" dur="4.529">deep state and this funds their</text>
  <text start="511.43" dur="4.2">operations around the world it makes</text>
  <text start="513.409" dur="6.271">them very profitable they steal hard</text>
  <text start="515.63" dur="5.969">assets by trading in paper currency and</text>
  <text start="519.68" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;ve been doing this for a very long</text>
  <text start="521.599" dur="4.651">time in it and it allows them to</text>
  <text start="523.58" dur="5.64">maintain control over the world that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="526.25" dur="5.76">the name of the game control we see</text>
  <text start="529.22" dur="5.16">Trump and Patriots now I need to clear</text>
  <text start="532.01" dur="5.4">this up Trump is not the only one doing</text>
  <text start="534.38" dur="5.72">this he&amp;#39;s the mouthpiece of all the</text>
  <text start="537.41" dur="6.24">different Patriots that are trying to</text>
  <text start="540.1" dur="7.09">remove the central banking system remove</text>
  <text start="543.65" dur="5.55">the deep state and bring America back to</text>
  <text start="547.19" dur="3.93">the way it was well it can&amp;#39;t go right</text>
  <text start="549.2" dur="4.11">back to the way it was because things</text>
  <text start="551.12" dur="5.42">have rapidly changed and the central</text>
  <text start="553.31" dur="6.719">bankers have basically ruined our</text>
  <text start="556.54" dur="5.56">manufacturing base so to bring all that</text>
  <text start="560.029" dur="4.231">back is going to take some time just</text>
  <text start="562.1" dur="5.34">like it took a lot of time to ship it</text>
  <text start="564.26" dur="5.28">all off over to the east to bring it all</text>
  <text start="567.44" dur="3.99">back you can&amp;#39;t do that in a couple of</text>
  <text start="569.54" dur="4.169">months you can&amp;#39;t do that in a year it</text>
  <text start="571.43" dur="5.279">will take a very very long time but what</text>
  <text start="573.709" dur="7.111">can be done is we can start from Ground</text>
  <text start="576.709" dur="6.931">Zero we can remove the central bank we</text>
  <text start="580.82" dur="5.37">can start to bring back companies</text>
  <text start="583.64" dur="4.68">manufacturing and let this happen over</text>
  <text start="586.19" dur="4.77">time and the only way to do</text>
  <text start="588.32" dur="4.38">of this and to basically bring America</text>
  <text start="590.96" dur="4.14">back to the way it was and to remove</text>
  <text start="592.7" dur="4.94">those factions that have destroyed the</text>
  <text start="595.1" dur="4.89">country is to destroy their system and</text>
  <text start="597.64" dur="4.81">we can see there is a battle going on</text>
  <text start="599.99" dur="4.8">right now because you need to gain the</text>
  <text start="602.45" dur="4.83">narrative of the story because whoever</text>
  <text start="604.79" dur="4.53">has the narrative whoever wins</text>
  <text start="607.28" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re the ones who explain to the</text>
  <text start="609.32" dur="4.77">American public to the global population</text>
  <text start="612.02" dur="5.42">of what actually happened just like the</text>
  <text start="614.09" dur="6.3">deep state that was in power during 1971</text>
  <text start="617.44" dur="5.68">they had control of a narrative behind</text>
  <text start="620.39" dur="5.94">the scenes they were taking us off the</text>
  <text start="623.12" dur="5.37">gold standard in 1971 bringing us on to</text>
  <text start="626.33" dur="4.11">the petro dollar system they controlled</text>
  <text start="628.49" dur="5.61">the narrative and they told the world</text>
  <text start="630.44" dur="5.88">that we were running out of oil we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="634.1" dur="4.29">find any oil this is why you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="636.32" dur="3.87">see gas lines this is why you won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="638.39" dur="3.86">able to get the fuel for your car this</text>
  <text start="640.19" dur="5.97">is why there&amp;#39;ll be high unemployment</text>
  <text start="642.25" dur="6.19">because they controlled the narrative</text>
  <text start="646.16" dur="5.04">the same thing is happening right now</text>
  <text start="648.44" dur="4.59">there&amp;#39;s a battle going on between the</text>
  <text start="651.2" dur="3.36">central bank and the Patriots on who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="653.03" dur="4.14">going to control the narrative and</text>
  <text start="654.56" dur="4.59">there&amp;#39;s different covert operations in</text>
  <text start="657.17" dur="4.74">the background that are happening right</text>
  <text start="659.15" dur="5.81">now I mean Trump came out today and he</text>
  <text start="661.91" dur="6.96">said China and Russia they are</text>
  <text start="664.96" dur="6.64">manipulating currencies their currency</text>
  <text start="668.87" dur="4.83">manipulator even though there was a</text>
  <text start="671.6" dur="4.65">report coming out of the Treasury saying</text>
  <text start="673.7" dur="4.95">that no one is manipulating the currency</text>
  <text start="676.25" dur="5.16">and it looks like what he&amp;#39;s trying to do</text>
  <text start="678.65" dur="5.76">is he&amp;#39;s trying to push the currency war</text>
  <text start="681.41" dur="4.95">forward to bring down the system because</text>
  <text start="684.41" dur="5.58">what&amp;#39;s very interesting on what he said</text>
  <text start="686.36" dur="5.19">was the following now he accuses China</text>
  <text start="689.99" dur="4.23">and Russia of playing the currency</text>
  <text start="691.55" dur="5.07">devaluation game at the time of rising</text>
  <text start="694.22" dur="7.35">interest rates which Trump slammed as</text>
  <text start="696.62" dur="7.59">not acceptable he said that as China and</text>
  <text start="701.57" dur="5.46">Russia devalue their currency the United</text>
  <text start="704.21" dur="7.65">States has to raise their rates now</text>
  <text start="707.03" dur="7.2">again are Russia and China devaluing</text>
  <text start="711.86" dur="5.85">their currencies actually not really</text>
  <text start="714.23" dur="5.55">China yes Russia not really and I think</text>
  <text start="717.71" dur="4.229">this is a sign where he wants the</text>
  <text start="719.78" dur="5.579">central bank to raise the</text>
  <text start="721.939" dur="7.531">rates to destroy the economy and I think</text>
  <text start="725.359" dur="7.08">this is the beginning phase of trying to</text>
  <text start="729.47" dur="4.919">destroy the dollar because again if he</text>
  <text start="732.439" dur="4.531">can get the central bank to continually</text>
  <text start="734.389" dur="3.87">raise the rates and say they are raising</text>
  <text start="736.97" dur="2.969">the rates because he put it out there</text>
  <text start="738.259" dur="4.08">that the United States is raising the</text>
  <text start="739.939" dur="4.8">rates he can bring down the system</text>
  <text start="742.339" dur="4.02">because we&amp;#39;ve seen it happen before now</text>
  <text start="744.739" dur="3.84">remember he&amp;#39;s already implemented</text>
  <text start="746.359" dur="4.47">tariffs he&amp;#39;s already talked about</text>
  <text start="748.579" dur="5.28">reciprocal taxes everything that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="750.829" dur="6.15">doing right now is to destroy the</text>
  <text start="753.859" dur="6.66">central banking system and to line up</text>
  <text start="756.979" dur="6.48">the entire economic structure for the</text>
  <text start="760.519" dur="4.5">transition so he&amp;#39;s doing two things at</text>
  <text start="763.459" dur="3.75">once and that&amp;#39;s not just him I just used</text>
  <text start="765.019" dur="4.38">him as saying that he&amp;#39;s the focal point</text>
  <text start="767.209" dur="5.011">but there are many individuals working</text>
  <text start="769.399" dur="4.83">with him and the deep state again they</text>
  <text start="772.22" dur="4.619">don&amp;#39;t want their system to be brought</text>
  <text start="774.229" dur="4.2">down by Trump they don&amp;#39;t want him to</text>
  <text start="776.839" dur="3.631">gain the narrative they don&amp;#39;t want him</text>
  <text start="778.429" dur="3.75">to say oh it was the central bankers</text>
  <text start="780.47" dur="5.699">fault they were raising interest rates</text>
  <text start="782.179" dur="5.7">and he can go back to 2006 2007 2008 and</text>
  <text start="786.169" dur="4.62">used that as an example saying listen</text>
  <text start="787.879" dur="5.04">they raised the rates during that period</text>
  <text start="790.789" dur="3.931">of time and when they reached a certain</text>
  <text start="792.919" dur="3.51">point and they saw the economy breaking</text>
  <text start="794.72" dur="4.469">down they started to lower the rates</text>
  <text start="796.429" dur="5.041">they can do the same thing once again</text>
  <text start="799.189" dur="5.61">and I think this is the beginning phase</text>
  <text start="801.47" dur="5.909">of trying to destroy the dollar and and</text>
  <text start="804.799" dur="5.7">you know push this currency war forward</text>
  <text start="807.379" dur="4.86">now remember we already see signs that</text>
  <text start="810.499" dur="4.38">the United States is getting prepared</text>
  <text start="812.239" dur="4.77">and ready to join the one belt one Road</text>
  <text start="814.879" dur="4.5">because we understand right now that</text>
  <text start="817.009" dur="4.98">they have the manufacturing the United</text>
  <text start="819.379" dur="5.82">States does not we need to have trade</text>
  <text start="821.989" dur="5.28">the old trade system will not work the</text>
  <text start="825.199" dur="4.58">global system will not work it has been</text>
  <text start="827.269" dur="6.48">disome it&amp;#39;s being dismantled right now</text>
  <text start="829.779" dur="6.67">once the dollar goes away well it&amp;#39;s game</text>
  <text start="833.749" dur="6.08">over and we need to switch the game</text>
  <text start="836.449" dur="5.79">around and create different type of</text>
  <text start="839.829" dur="4.03">trade with other countries this is why</text>
  <text start="842.239" dur="3.69">Trump is out there doing bilateral</text>
  <text start="843.859" dur="4.53">trades with many countries and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="845.929" dur="5.52">realizing that yes now is the time we</text>
  <text start="848.389" dur="5.73">need to go and most likely interconnect</text>
  <text start="851.449" dur="4.411">with the belt and Road and it looks like</text>
  <text start="854.119" dur="4.321">he&amp;#39;s following that</text>
  <text start="855.86" dur="3.539">step right now while destroying the</text>
  <text start="858.44" dur="2.49">economy there&amp;#39;s a lot of things</text>
  <text start="859.399" dur="4.38">happening all at once and they all enter</text>
  <text start="860.93" dur="5.839">twine remember the petrodollar right now</text>
  <text start="863.779" dur="5.671">is the Middle East the Middle East</text>
  <text start="866.769" dur="5.651">controls the petrodollar was set up this</text>
  <text start="869.45" dur="6.35">way back in 1971 and once these</text>
  <text start="872.42" dur="7.14">countries decide to govern themselves</text>
  <text start="875.8" dur="6.07">they&amp;#39;ll make decisions of how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="879.56" dur="4.68">going to sell their oil most of them</text>
  <text start="881.87" dur="4.92">just like they wanted to do going back</text>
  <text start="884.24" dur="4.71">when we invaded Libya Lebanon Iraq they</text>
  <text start="886.79" dur="4.38">all wanted to use either gold their own</text>
  <text start="888.95" dur="4.62">currency the Euro or another currency</text>
  <text start="891.17" dur="3.99">and this is why the United States went</text>
  <text start="893.57" dur="3.03">in there and said no no no you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="895.16" dur="3.179">going to do that we need regime change</text>
  <text start="896.6" dur="3.84">to make sure that everyone&amp;#39;s using the</text>
  <text start="898.339" dur="3.99">dollar because if they did that at that</text>
  <text start="900.44" dur="4.2">time countries would not have to keep</text>
  <text start="902.329" dur="5.971">the dollar in reserves they would take</text>
  <text start="904.64" dur="5.28">on other currencies and the dollar that</text>
  <text start="908.3" dur="3.12">would flow back to United States and we</text>
  <text start="909.92" dur="3.45">would see inflation and hyperinflation</text>
  <text start="911.42" dur="4.77">and the whole thing would have come down</text>
  <text start="913.37" dur="4.77">this is why they went out and they tried</text>
  <text start="916.19" dur="4.32">to control the Middle East once again</text>
  <text start="918.14" dur="4.949">now we can see that all this is coming</text>
  <text start="920.51" dur="4.38">to an end very very quickly and once</text>
  <text start="923.089" dur="3.87">they make to sit once the Middle East</text>
  <text start="924.89" dur="4.17">makes decisions on not using the dollar</text>
  <text start="926.959" dur="5.401">well guess what these dollars need to go</text>
  <text start="929.06" dur="4.709">someplace if they&amp;#39;re not in reserves in</text>
  <text start="932.36" dur="3.24">different countries to buy the oil</text>
  <text start="933.769" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re coming back to United States</text>
  <text start="935.6" dur="4.799">everything is moving from the west to</text>
  <text start="937.399" dur="4.5">the east right now this is why China has</text>
  <text start="940.399" dur="3.541">been purchasing gold Russia has been</text>
  <text start="941.899" dur="4.56">purchasing gold Russia has taken control</text>
  <text start="943.94" dur="4.2">of the private western central bank we</text>
  <text start="946.459" dur="4.051">have the petro yuyuan we have all the</text>
  <text start="948.14" dur="4.17">trading systems the gold exchange</text>
  <text start="950.51" dur="5.49">everything has been duplicated out in</text>
  <text start="952.31" dur="5.279">China and this is why the one belt one</text>
  <text start="956" dur="3.449">road is very important because these are</text>
  <text start="957.589" dur="3.781">all the routes going to all the emerging</text>
  <text start="959.449" dur="4.591">markets going into Europe going into</text>
  <text start="961.37" dur="5.94">Russia and they&amp;#39;ll be trading outside of</text>
  <text start="964.04" dur="6.72">the dollar and eventually the dollar</text>
  <text start="967.31" dur="5.04">will not be used anymore and we can see</text>
  <text start="970.76" dur="2.819">that all of this when you take all of</text>
  <text start="972.35" dur="4.95">this and you combine it together</text>
  <text start="973.579" dur="6.391">you can see this is a disaster scenario</text>
  <text start="977.3" dur="4.32">for the United States and this is why we</text>
  <text start="979.97" dur="3.57">need to transition into something else</text>
  <text start="981.62" dur="4.199">we need bilateral trade agreements we</text>
  <text start="983.54" dur="5.22">need the joy in the belton road we need</text>
  <text start="985.819" dur="4.251">to transition out of the globalist</text>
  <text start="988.76" dur="5.569">central banking</text>
  <text start="990.07" dur="6.6">into a brand new system and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="994.329" dur="4.2">we are doing right now so we are going</text>
  <text start="996.67" dur="3.75">to be going through this transition it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="998.529" dur="2.911">gonna be very rough a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1000.42" dur="2.159">aren&amp;#39;t gonna be understanding what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1001.44" dur="2.31">going on just like a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1002.579" dur="3.781">didn&amp;#39;t understand what was happening in</text>
  <text start="1003.75" dur="3.87">1971 again there was no internet very</text>
  <text start="1006.36" dur="3.029">difficult to get the information out</text>
  <text start="1007.62" dur="4.44">there people really thought there was a</text>
  <text start="1009.389" dur="6.241">gas shortage people really thought there</text>
  <text start="1012.06" dur="4.829">were people speculating in gold and this</text>
  <text start="1015.63" dur="3.75">is why we had to come off the gold</text>
  <text start="1016.889" dur="4.231">standard today people have a lot more</text>
  <text start="1019.38" dur="3.899">information today</text>

  <text start="1052.77" dur="4.529">see what is happening we will go back in</text>
  <text start="1055.11" dur="4.23">time we&amp;#39;ll see what the central bankers</text>
