  <text start="56.199" dur="5.61">to report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="57.91" dur="7.2">episode 1299 a and today&amp;#39;s date is June</text>
  <text start="61.809" dur="5.431">6 2017 and the thought of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.11" dur="4.939">the last stage of popping the bubbles</text>
  <text start="67.24" dur="5.1">has begun it&amp;#39;s only a matter of time</text>
  <text start="70.049" dur="5.051">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="72.34" dur="7.199">financial news now we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="75.1" dur="6.6">a lot of problems in the economy and</text>
  <text start="79.539" dur="4.051">it&amp;#39;s getting worse we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="81.7" dur="4.309">retail and we are seeing that retail</text>
  <text start="83.59" dur="5.61">stores they are closing left and right</text>
  <text start="86.009" dur="5.951">bankruptcies are happening and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="89.2" dur="5.07">just in the retail industry it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="91.96" dur="4.38">happening in every single sector but in</text>
  <text start="94.27" dur="4.98">the retail industry it is really</text>
  <text start="96.34" dur="6.3">noticeable and Macy&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="99.25" dur="5.13">that their profit margin well it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="102.64" dur="3.24">going to be where they think it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="104.38" dur="3.12">to be it&amp;#39;s going to be about 60 to 80</text>
  <text start="105.88" dur="3.599">basis points lower</text>
  <text start="107.5" dur="4.259">and remember they made this forecast</text>
  <text start="109.479" dur="4.59">back in February and they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="111.759" dur="4.92">realize well things aren&amp;#39;t going to be</text>
  <text start="114.069" dur="4.741">as good as we thought and a lot of</text>
  <text start="116.679" dur="5.491">stores are starting to look at this and</text>
  <text start="118.81" dur="4.74">say okay yes we had a projection we</text>
  <text start="122.17" dur="3.72">projected it out for the rest of this</text>
  <text start="123.55" dur="5.67">year but it looks like we&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="125.89" dur="6">to hit any of these goals and things are</text>
  <text start="129.22" dur="7.89">a lot worse than we originally thought</text>
  <text start="131.89" dur="7.76">now remember prior to 2008 going into</text>
  <text start="137.11" dur="5.159">2008 we started to see a rise in</text>
  <text start="139.65" dur="5.199">consumer and business bankruptcies and</text>
  <text start="142.269" dur="6.121">of course they skyrocketed right after</text>
  <text start="144.849" dur="6.091">the market fell in 2008 going into 2009</text>
  <text start="148.39" dur="4.98">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see the same exact</text>
  <text start="150.94" dur="4.47">thing happened once again we see</text>
  <text start="153.37" dur="4.56">consumer and business bankruptcies well</text>
  <text start="155.41" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;re rising again after they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="157.93" dur="7.62">declining since at my own 2010 to 2015</text>
  <text start="161.62" dur="6">and this is not a good sign bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="165.55" dur="4.189">filings for businesses from large</text>
  <text start="167.62" dur="5.369">corporations to tiny sole</text>
  <text start="169.739" dur="6.881">proprietorships well that started back</text>
  <text start="172.989" dur="5.851">in November of 2015 and at first it was</text>
  <text start="176.62" dur="3.66">the energy bust and people well it was</text>
  <text start="178.84" dur="3.78">the energy sector we could see what</text>
  <text start="180.28" dur="4.83">happened prices came down and they</text>
  <text start="182.62" dur="3.75">couldn&amp;#39;t operate and things started to</text>
  <text start="185.11" dur="3.93">fall apart</text>
  <text start="186.37" dur="6.21">but the bankruptcies of these energy</text>
  <text start="189.04" dur="5.729">companies they have tapered off and what</text>
  <text start="192.58" dur="4.939">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="194.769" dur="6.571">bankruptcies in the retail sector in</text>
  <text start="197.519" dur="7.36">consumer sector well they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="201.34" dur="7.679">pick up the slack so really here we go</text>
  <text start="204.879" dur="5.731">again total US business bankruptcies in</text>
  <text start="209.019" dur="3.961">May rose by four point seven percent</text>
  <text start="210.61" dur="3.57">year-over-year and there are about three</text>
  <text start="212.98" dur="3.089">thousand five hundred seventy two</text>
  <text start="214.18" dur="4.38">filings and this is according to the</text>
  <text start="216.069" dur="6">american bankruptcy institute that&amp;#39;s up</text>
  <text start="218.56" dur="6.45">40 percent from May 2015 and up ten</text>
  <text start="222.069" dur="5.64">percent from May 2014 and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="225.01" dur="5.819">another concern bankruptcy filings are</text>
  <text start="227.709" dur="6.241">highly seasonal they peak in the tax</text>
  <text start="230.829" dur="6.03">season around March or April and then</text>
  <text start="233.95" dur="4.649">they fall off so the decline in April</text>
  <text start="236.859" dur="4.761">after the peak of March was within the</text>
  <text start="238.599" dur="8.161">seasonal pattern but over the past years</text>
  <text start="241.62" dur="9.58">filings dropped in May but not this year</text>
  <text start="246.76" dur="6.9">this year they jumped and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="251.2" dur="4.98">seeing is total u.s. bankruptcy files</text>
  <text start="253.66" dur="4.949">and filings by consumers and businesses</text>
  <text start="256.18" dur="6.48">in May rose by 5.3 percent</text>
  <text start="258.609" dur="6.271">year-over-year to 69 thousand consumers</text>
  <text start="262.66" dur="5.25">at risk of seeking bankruptcy protection</text>
  <text start="264.88" dur="6.84">are those with insurmountable piles of</text>
  <text start="267.91" dur="9.9">debt and a stagnating or declining real</text>
  <text start="271.72" dur="11.419">income and we saw this back in 2007-2008</text>
  <text start="277.81" dur="9.75">now the amount of debt is driven by</text>
  <text start="283.139" dur="8.111">student loans auto loans revolving</text>
  <text start="287.56" dur="6.57">credit like credit cards and we can see</text>
  <text start="291.25" dur="4.919">and also medical bills and treatment</text>
  <text start="294.13" dur="4.62">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s all plays into this</text>
  <text start="296.169" dur="4.5">normally not mortgages mortgages people</text>
  <text start="298.75" dur="5.15">say okay you know what I can take a loan</text>
  <text start="300.669" dur="6.301">or an equity loan and I&amp;#39;ll be fine but</text>
  <text start="303.9" dur="4.12">normally this happens with student loans</text>
  <text start="306.97" dur="2.91">auto loans and the things that we</text>
  <text start="308.02" dur="5.04">mentioned and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="309.88" dur="5.849">now is that there&amp;#39;s a lot of this debt</text>
  <text start="313.06" dur="5.13">credit card debt is around one trillion</text>
  <text start="315.729" dur="4.261">it is just one notch below the peak</text>
  <text start="318.19" dur="4.11">during the financial crisis</text>
  <text start="319.99" dur="5.46">loan balances outstanding have surged 30</text>
  <text start="322.3" dur="8.37">36 percent from the pre-crisis peak in</text>
  <text start="325.45" dur="7.14">2006 to 1.1 2 trillion and student loan</text>
  <text start="330.67" dur="3.69">balances outstanding have surged a</text>
  <text start="332.59" dur="4.17">hundred and eighty percent of the same</text>
  <text start="334.36" dur="5.1">period to one point four four trillion</text>
  <text start="336.76" dur="6.15">this amounts to over three point five</text>
  <text start="339.46" dur="6.89">trillion plus medical debts and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="342.91" dur="7.32">starting to see bankruptcies increase</text>
  <text start="346.35" dur="7.17">where in the past they decreased during</text>
  <text start="350.23" dur="7.77">this period so it looks like things are</text>
  <text start="353.52" dur="6.91">repeating what we saw back in 2008-2009</text>
  <text start="358" dur="6.2">it looks like we&amp;#39;re back in that same</text>
  <text start="360.43" dur="6.87">situation now we understand that the</text>
  <text start="364.2" dur="4.84">budget well that only takes us to</text>
  <text start="367.3" dur="3.75">September 30th that trillion dollar</text>
  <text start="369.04" dur="4.2">budget they passed we understand that</text>
  <text start="371.05" dur="4.2">the debt ceiling is coming up and the</text>
  <text start="373.24" dur="3.54">government is running out of money which</text>
  <text start="375.25" dur="3.87">means there&amp;#39;s going to be a shutdown it</text>
  <text start="376.78" dur="4.32">really doesn&amp;#39;t affect the people but it</text>
  <text start="379.12" dur="3.3">looks really really good on the</text>
  <text start="381.1" dur="3.33">corporate media and people get all</text>
  <text start="382.42" dur="2.37">scared but all your services and</text>
  <text start="384.43" dur="3.15">everything</text>
  <text start="384.79" dur="5.31">well they don&amp;#39;t cease to exist they</text>
  <text start="387.58" dur="5.28">continue on but we see House Minority</text>
  <text start="390.1" dur="4.62">Leader Nancy Pelosi she is out there and</text>
  <text start="392.86" dur="5.99">she is saying that they&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="394.72" dur="8.48">the debt ceiling as leverage to stop</text>
  <text start="398.85" dur="6.4">Trump&amp;#39;s tax proposals and at this point</text>
  <text start="403.2" dur="4.06">looking at Trump and looking at his</text>
  <text start="405.25" dur="4.47">actions I don&amp;#39;t think he really cares</text>
  <text start="407.26" dur="4.77">because he understands that the economy</text>
  <text start="409.72" dur="3.96">is not going to last the way it is right</text>
  <text start="412.03" dur="3.39">now even if the debt ceiling is raised</text>
  <text start="413.68" dur="4.29">if it&amp;#39;s not raised it makes no</text>
  <text start="415.42" dur="5.25">difference the amount of debt the amount</text>
  <text start="417.97" dur="5.85">of tax receipts coming in it just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="420.67" dur="5.22">work any more any realizes it so if the</text>
  <text start="423.82" dur="4.2">debt ceiling is raised which is going to</text>
  <text start="425.89" dur="4.68">add more debt more people are going to</text>
  <text start="428.02" dur="3.75">lose their jobs tax receipts coming into</text>
  <text start="430.57" dur="3.57">the government will not be able to</text>
  <text start="431.77" dur="5.7">support the debt if the debt ceiling is</text>
  <text start="434.14" dur="6.33">not raised well guess what government is</text>
  <text start="437.47" dur="6.14">shut down the longer it goes well the</text>
  <text start="440.47" dur="6.18">more the government is not spending and</text>
  <text start="443.61" dur="5.14">what it means is a lot of departments</text>
  <text start="446.65" dur="4.62">will start to close slowly but surely</text>
  <text start="448.75" dur="4.449">and it&amp;#39;s a waiting game because no</text>
  <text start="451.27" dur="3.88">matter which way we look at it</text>
  <text start="453.199" dur="4.53">the economy is going to collapse and we</text>
  <text start="455.15" dur="5.549">know that these individuals in</text>
  <text start="457.729" dur="4.77">government it looks really bad if they</text>
  <text start="460.699" dur="4.861">keep something shut down for a long</text>
  <text start="462.499" dur="4.41">period of time and yes she might be</text>
  <text start="465.56" dur="3.75">saying that she&amp;#39;s going to use this as</text>
  <text start="466.909" dur="5.28">leverage but guess what just like the</text>
  <text start="469.31" dur="4.409">Republicans they will always give in and</text>
  <text start="472.189" dur="3.871">they will raise the debt ceiling and</text>
  <text start="473.719" dur="5.31">this is exactly what he wants them to do</text>
  <text start="476.06" dur="6.75">he wants the debt ceiling raised because</text>
  <text start="479.029" dur="7.14">he realizes he understands that he needs</text>
  <text start="482.81" dur="5.46">to continually add more to the debt we</text>
  <text start="486.169" dur="4.62">need to blow up these bubbles we need to</text>
  <text start="488.27" dur="5.16">bring down the system his strategy is</text>
  <text start="490.789" dur="5.4">not to repair the economy that were in</text>
  <text start="493.43" dur="4.709">today his strategy is to collapse the</text>
  <text start="496.189" dur="4.47">economy that were in today and then</text>
  <text start="498.139" dur="5.221">rebuild it through the transition this</text>
  <text start="500.659" dur="5.73">is what he&amp;#39;s been preparing for now we</text>
  <text start="503.36" dur="4.5">can see that the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="506.389" dur="3.45">are out there trying to make it look</text>
  <text start="507.86" dur="3.839">like the economy is doing fantastic and</text>
  <text start="509.839" dur="3.99">they want to do this because they&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="511.699" dur="3.541">the other side now looking at Trump</text>
  <text start="513.829" dur="2.88">saying okay we need to bring this down</text>
  <text start="515.24" dur="3.779">before he does because we need to</text>
  <text start="516.709" dur="4.231">control the narrative and the way the</text>
  <text start="519.019" dur="3.06">central bank needs to do it yes can they</text>
  <text start="520.94" dur="2.67">just push a button and just have</text>
  <text start="522.079" dur="3.901">everything come to an end of course they</text>
  <text start="523.61" dur="4.409">can but that wouldn&amp;#39;t look natural that</text>
  <text start="525.98" dur="4.2">wouldn&amp;#39;t look like a natural crash so</text>
  <text start="528.019" dur="4.371">what they need to do is they get the</text>
  <text start="530.18" dur="5.73">insiders out out of the stock market</text>
  <text start="532.39" dur="5.379">they bring in the retail investors like</text>
  <text start="535.91" dur="3.419">the Millennials which now we see on the</text>
  <text start="537.769" dur="4.111">corporate media they&amp;#39;re out there saying</text>
  <text start="539.329" dur="5.94">that since the financial crisis has</text>
  <text start="541.88" dur="5.819">ended about a year ago Millennials who</text>
  <text start="545.269" dur="4.591">were a little nervous about investing</text>
  <text start="547.699" dur="5.491">well they&amp;#39;re looking at the market once</text>
  <text start="549.86" dur="5.07">again and it looks like maybe they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="553.19" dur="3.75">start investing in the market because</text>
  <text start="554.93" dur="4.5">they can see that it&amp;#39;s stable and it</text>
  <text start="556.94" dur="5.129">continually moves up and it looks like</text>
  <text start="559.43" dur="4.29">maybe now it&amp;#39;s time now this is an</text>
  <text start="562.069" dur="3.96">article which they&amp;#39;re putting out there</text>
  <text start="563.72" dur="5.25">this one&amp;#39;s on market watch it is to</text>
  <text start="566.029" dur="6.781">convince everyone that everything is</text>
  <text start="568.97" dur="5.549">fine in the economy to get people into</text>
  <text start="572.81" dur="4.2">the stock market</text>
  <text start="574.519" dur="4.471">so the insiders can pull out the retail</text>
  <text start="577.01" dur="4.71">investors that come in because they know</text>
  <text start="578.99" dur="4.05">the bubble is about to pop this is what</text>
  <text start="581.72" dur="4.32">they do in real estate</text>
  <text start="583.04" dur="3.76">once all the speculators are out there</text>
  <text start="586.04" dur="2.979">and they have the</text>
  <text start="586.8" dur="5.46">information and they realize the housing</text>
  <text start="589.019" dur="5.611">bubbles at its maximum what they do is</text>
  <text start="592.26" dur="3.81">they start selling off their properties</text>
  <text start="594.63" dur="3.06">and the retail investors come in and</text>
  <text start="596.07" dur="2.94">they start purchasing tons of them</text>
  <text start="597.69" dur="3.269">thinking that the markets going to</text>
  <text start="599.01" dur="4.769">continually rise and then all of a</text>
  <text start="600.959" dur="5.791">sudden everything comes crashing down so</text>
  <text start="603.779" dur="4.711">we are at that point where we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="606.75" dur="3.51">to see everything start to fall apart</text>
  <text start="608.49" dur="4.65">now we need to remember something very</text>
  <text start="610.26" dur="5.1">important here the central bank they</text>
  <text start="613.14" dur="4.65">really don&amp;#39;t have any more tools to keep</text>
  <text start="615.36" dur="4.86">this economy going yes they can use</text>
  <text start="617.79" dur="3.93">stimulus they might pass stimulus off</text>
  <text start="620.22" dur="3.84">from country to country</text>
  <text start="621.72" dur="5.07">we had Mark Zuckerberg out there talking</text>
  <text start="624.06" dur="4.7">about universal basic income where</text>
  <text start="626.79" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re going to give cash to</text>
  <text start="628.76" dur="3.699">individuals we know this is not going to</text>
  <text start="631.2" dur="2.819">work this is going to cause inflation</text>
  <text start="632.459" dur="4.741">which means that there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="634.019" dur="5.731">more currency in the economy which is</text>
  <text start="637.2" dur="4.71">going to devalue the currency and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="639.75" dur="4.29">going to cause more debt the tax</text>
  <text start="641.91" dur="4.59">receipts coming in will not be able to</text>
  <text start="644.04" dur="5.19">support this and eventually this will</text>
  <text start="646.5" dur="6.149">crash the economy yes it will work for a</text>
  <text start="649.23" dur="6.45">short period of time very short and then</text>
  <text start="652.649" dur="5.25">things will start to unravel so what do</text>
  <text start="655.68" dur="5.279">they have left well they have nothing</text>
  <text start="657.899" dur="5.551">left and this is the major problem now</text>
  <text start="660.959" dur="4.38">what I see happening here is when things</text>
  <text start="663.45" dur="5.73">start to fall apart we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="665.339" dur="5.671">it happen on the outskirts around the</text>
  <text start="669.18" dur="3.24">world what I mean by that we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="671.01" dur="3.329">see it happen in many different</text>
  <text start="672.42" dur="4.62">countries of course we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="674.339" dur="4.471">it in the emerging markets first the</text>
  <text start="677.04" dur="3.87">smaller countries it&amp;#39;s going to head to</text>
  <text start="678.81" dur="3.779">Europe and then eventually here to</text>
  <text start="680.91" dur="3.36">United States just like we saw back in</text>
  <text start="682.589" dur="4.951">the Great Depression now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="684.27" dur="6.09">interesting is South Africa well they</text>
  <text start="687.54" dur="5.039">just plunged into a recession so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="690.36" dur="3.96">starting to see financial institutions</text>
  <text start="692.579" dur="3.271">continually fail we had Deutsche Bank</text>
  <text start="694.32" dur="2.94">which had to be bailed out we had</text>
  <text start="695.85" dur="4.2">Italian banks that had to be bailed out</text>
  <text start="697.26" dur="5.79">we say Banco Popular in Spain which</text>
  <text start="700.05" dur="6.539">needs a bail in or some type of investor</text>
  <text start="703.05" dur="5.729">to step in we see home capital in Canada</text>
  <text start="706.589" dur="5.011">which is a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="708.779" dur="6.151">and now we have South Africa that just</text>
  <text start="711.6" dur="6.69">entered a recession and we can see the</text>
  <text start="714.93" dur="5.04">GDP numbers are way down they tumble</text>
  <text start="718.29" dur="3.839">down to about 0.7%</text>
  <text start="719.97" dur="4.109">which is very interesting which is very</text>
  <text start="722.129" dur="5.31">close to the United States GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="724.079" dur="6.03">and we can see that it&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="727.439" dur="5.4">starting on the outskirts and it will</text>
  <text start="730.109" dur="4.59">work its way in very slowly now the</text>
  <text start="732.839" dur="4.08">central bankers realizes and we have to</text>
  <text start="734.699" dur="7.38">remember something very important we are</text>
  <text start="736.919" dur="6.99">now coming off of the dollar oil dollar</text>
  <text start="742.079" dur="5.07">system which is the petrodollar system</text>
  <text start="743.909" dur="4.95">now why Trump is doing everything behind</text>
  <text start="747.149" dur="3.6">the scenes and actually a little bit</text>
  <text start="748.859" dur="5.1">later in the next report I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="750.749" dur="5.28">explain why the corporate media might be</text>
  <text start="753.959" dur="4.68">catching on right now about what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="756.029" dur="4.5">really doing what we see happening right</text>
  <text start="758.639" dur="3.331">now is his he&amp;#39;s working behind the</text>
  <text start="760.529" dur="3">scenes trying to get everything set up</text>
  <text start="761.97" dur="3.539">he&amp;#39;s looking at the land reviewing the</text>
  <text start="763.529" dur="3.54">land that the president&amp;#39;s put aside he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="765.509" dur="4.2">looking at financial resources he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="767.069" dur="5.07">looking at oil offshore drilling</text>
  <text start="769.709" dur="4.59">drilling in Alaska because he realizes</text>
  <text start="772.139" dur="4.02">once we come off the petrodollar guess</text>
  <text start="774.299" dur="3.63">what the oil that we&amp;#39;re receiving from</text>
  <text start="776.159" dur="4.83">the Middle East is going to freeze up</text>
  <text start="777.929" dur="5.22">just like it did back in 1971 when we</text>
  <text start="780.989" dur="4.83">were going on the oil petro dollar</text>
  <text start="783.149" dur="4.62">system well we couldn&amp;#39;t get oil in there</text>
  <text start="785.819" dur="3.27">until the deal was made and this is why</text>
  <text start="787.769" dur="2.97">people this is why the corporate media</text>
  <text start="789.089" dur="3.42">and the government was out there saying</text>
  <text start="790.739" dur="3.84">there were shortages no it was because</text>
  <text start="792.509" dur="4.02">they were coming off the gold system</text>
  <text start="794.579" dur="5.85">moving on to the petro dollar system and</text>
  <text start="796.529" dur="5.67">everything wasn&amp;#39;t ironed out and we see</text>
  <text start="800.429" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;re on the back end of this now</text>
  <text start="802.199" dur="4.74">remember trade he said is very important</text>
  <text start="804.839" dur="5.18">yes we need to have some type of trade</text>
  <text start="806.939" dur="6.24">why because what we do today is</text>
  <text start="810.019" dur="6.91">countries they receive the dollars they</text>
  <text start="813.179" dur="6.15">use those dollars to buy our goods that</text>
  <text start="816.929" dur="6.21">we manufacturing and manufacturing has</text>
  <text start="819.329" dur="7.41">left this country so we&amp;#39;re we have less</text>
  <text start="823.139" dur="4.92">to give these countries and it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="826.739" dur="3.481">like when we first went out to the</text>
  <text start="828.059" dur="4.411">system where we had many many things to</text>
  <text start="830.22" dur="4.859">give these countries now we have a lot</text>
  <text start="832.47" dur="5.099">less because all manufacturing has left</text>
  <text start="835.079" dur="5.67">this country so when we come off the</text>
  <text start="837.569" dur="5.37">dollar petro dollar system guess what</text>
  <text start="840.749" dur="3.84">these countries don&amp;#39;t need to hold the</text>
  <text start="842.939" dur="3.24">dollar anymore they&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="844.589" dur="3.96">purchasing our goods with the dollar</text>
  <text start="846.179" dur="4.38">anymore so they will be off the dollar</text>
  <text start="848.549" dur="5.191">system which means we&amp;#39;re going to need</text>
  <text start="850.559" dur="6.061">to produce and trade with other</text>
  <text start="853.74" dur="5.55">trees and this is what is being set up</text>
  <text start="856.62" dur="5.52">right now it might be hard to see but</text>
  <text start="859.29" dur="4.8">this is the plan this is why trade is is</text>
  <text start="862.14" dur="4.22">so important this is why joining the</text>
  <text start="864.09" dur="6.33">belt and road is so important he</text>
  <text start="866.36" dur="5.41">unraveled the TPP this global a system</text>
  <text start="870.42" dur="2.91">that they wanted to keep the system</text>
  <text start="871.77" dur="3.69">going and bring the country down to a</text>
  <text start="873.33" dur="5.19">third world nation he removed us from</text>
  <text start="875.46" dur="5.94">the Paris climate Accord because what is</text>
  <text start="878.52" dur="5.28">happening right now is he understands</text>
  <text start="881.4" dur="4.35">and those individuals in that government</text>
  <text start="883.8" dur="4.31">that are behind him understand that this</text>
  <text start="885.75" dur="4.59">system it&amp;#39;s coming to an end and</text>
  <text start="888.11" dur="4.02">everything has to be in place now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="890.34" dur="5.13">going to go through a transition period</text>
  <text start="892.13" dur="6.94">just like we did coming off the gold</text>
  <text start="895.47" dur="6.24">system going onto the petrodollar system</text>
  <text start="899.07" dur="5.07">and many people think wow it was great</text>
  <text start="901.71" dur="4.44">then because you know my house price</text>
  <text start="904.14" dur="4.44">went up my income went up well what you</text>
  <text start="906.15" dur="5.61">didn&amp;#39;t realize was there was so much</text>
  <text start="908.58" dur="5.88">printing of money and as we came off the</text>
  <text start="911.76" dur="4.38">gold standard the dollar devalued that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="914.46" dur="3.15">why you saw inflation the way you did</text>
  <text start="916.14" dur="3.84">that&amp;#39;s why they raised the interest</text>
  <text start="917.61" dur="5.64">rates the way they did to try to control</text>
  <text start="919.98" dur="6.12">it now we&amp;#39;re on the back end interest</text>
  <text start="923.25" dur="6.06">rates very low wages going down we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="926.1" dur="5.13">see inflation right now we will because</text>
  <text start="929.31" dur="3.75">they give the dollar is going to devalue</text>
  <text start="931.23" dur="3.57">quite a bit when all these countries</text>
  <text start="933.06" dur="4.77">don&amp;#39;t need to hold on to the dollar</text>
  <text start="934.8" dur="4.89">anymore so we&amp;#39;re on the back end of all</text>
  <text start="937.83" dur="3.45">of this we&amp;#39;re going to go through this</text>
  <text start="939.69" dur="2.52">transition the corporate media is going</text>
  <text start="941.28" dur="2.73">to be out there telling you how terrible</text>
  <text start="942.21" dur="3.72">everything&amp;#39;s going to be everything that</text>
  <text start="944.01" dur="4.38">he&amp;#39;s doing is going to be awful it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="945.93" dur="3.66">going to work this is the mouthpiece of</text>
  <text start="948.39" dur="3.54">the deep state this is what the</text>
  <text start="949.59" dur="6.39">corporate media does but this is in</text>
  <text start="951.93" dur="5.28">preparation for the new system and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="955.98" dur="2.79">going to go through this transition this</text>
  <text start="957.21" dur="3.21">transition is going to be difficult</text>
  <text start="958.77" dur="4.05">because all those products that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="960.42" dur="4.35">been receiving from China the oil that</text>
  <text start="962.82" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;ve been receiving food products</text>
  <text start="964.77" dur="3.63">that&amp;#39;s going to come to a screeching</text>
  <text start="966.39" dur="3.96">halt until we get on to this new system</text>
  <text start="968.4" dur="5.36">so there&amp;#39;s going to be a time period</text>
  <text start="970.35" dur="6.15">where the entire economy will not be</text>
  <text start="973.76" dur="4.57">operational and this is what we are</text>
  <text start="976.5" dur="4.83">getting prepared for this is what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="978.33" dur="4.74">been talking about food water cash on</text>
  <text start="981.33" dur="4.05">hand gold and silver to protect your</text>
  <text start="983.07" dur="3.39">wealth a weapon because people are not</text>
  <text start="985.38" dur="2.22">going to be prepared for what is</text>
  <text start="986.46" dur="2.67">happening this is</text>
  <text start="987.6" dur="5.64">what we&amp;#39;ve been talking about all along</text>
  <text start="989.13" dur="7.29">and we are on that other end where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="993.24" dur="5.099">coming off of this petrol dollar system</text>
  <text start="996.42" dur="3.839">and it&amp;#39;s not going to be easy remember</text>
  <text start="998.339" dur="3.211">we have all this debt and all these</text>
  <text start="1000.259" dur="4.281">countries around the world are going to</text>
  <text start="1001.55" dur="5.729">say okay it&amp;#39;s not backed by oil anymore</text>
  <text start="1004.54" dur="5.289">the dollar is not backed by gold it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1007.279" dur="5.761">worth nothing and it and there&amp;#39;s debt</text>
  <text start="1009.829" dur="5.88">there&amp;#39;s so much debt attached to it why</text>
  <text start="1013.04" dur="4.77">do we want to hold this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1015.709" dur="4.291">going to take it and say we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1017.81" dur="3.449">this anymore and all those dollars are</text>
  <text start="1020" dur="3.36">going to flood back to the United States</text>
  <text start="1021.259" dur="4.621">and we&amp;#39;re going to see inflation which</text>
  <text start="1023.36" dur="6.449">is a lot of currency and circulation and</text>
