  <text start="53.45" dur="4.62">hi and welcome you listening to the ex</text>
  <text start="56.45" dur="4.74">when he to report my name is Dave and</text>
  <text start="58.07" dur="5.79">this is episode 1395 and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.19" dur="5.07">October 8th 2017 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="63.86" dur="4.98">episode is the economy has hit stall</text>
  <text start="66.26" dur="4.71">speed it&amp;#39;s not if but when the economy</text>
  <text start="68.84" dur="4.77">crashes let&amp;#39;s get right into the</text>
  <text start="70.97" dur="4.92">economic collapse news now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="73.61" dur="4.14">watching the economy and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="75.89" dur="3.03">looking at all these statistical numbers</text>
  <text start="77.75" dur="3.75">that the government has been putting out</text>
  <text start="78.92" dur="5.55">there and they and on Friday they put</text>
  <text start="81.5" dur="5.04">out the job numbers and when we really</text>
  <text start="84.47" dur="5.28">look at this we can see that well the</text>
  <text start="86.54" dur="5.61">economy is slowing down and it is</text>
  <text start="89.75" dur="4.77">approaching stall speed now economists</text>
  <text start="92.15" dur="4.2">they were projecting that we would see</text>
  <text start="94.52" dur="3.72">an increase of around 80,000 jobs last</text>
  <text start="96.35" dur="4.08">month and we need to add at least</text>
  <text start="98.24" dur="4.86">150,000 jobs each month to keep up with</text>
  <text start="100.43" dur="5.31">the population growth so the negative</text>
  <text start="103.1" dur="3.84">33000 number was a very huge</text>
  <text start="105.74" dur="2.519">disappointment and we know that they</text>
  <text start="106.94" dur="4.11">brought the unemployment number down</text>
  <text start="108.259" dur="7.321">from 4.4 percent down to 4.2 percent</text>
  <text start="111.05" dur="6.599">even though we lost 33,000 jobs this</text>
  <text start="115.58" dur="4.41">makes no sense at all but we know that</text>
  <text start="117.649" dur="3.871">their calculation the way they figure</text>
  <text start="119.99" dur="6">things out are completely manipulated</text>
  <text start="121.52" dur="7.049">massage and basically created to</text>
  <text start="125.99" dur="4.68">convince you that the economy is doing a</text>
  <text start="128.569" dur="5.611">lot better than it really is now in</text>
  <text start="130.67" dur="6.3">addition to September&amp;#39;s monthly numbers</text>
  <text start="134.18" dur="6.06">the July number was revised lower from</text>
  <text start="136.97" dur="6.3">one hundred eighty nine thousand to 138</text>
  <text start="140.24" dur="5.73">thousand now so far this year 2017 this</text>
  <text start="143.27" dur="5.22">has been the slowest job growth in at</text>
  <text start="145.97" dur="5.19">least five years so the economy is not</text>
  <text start="148.49" dur="5.88">booming at all the employment is not</text>
  <text start="151.16" dur="6.09">booming at all this is an economic</text>
  <text start="154.37" dur="4.83">slowdown that&amp;#39;s what we are experiencing</text>
  <text start="157.25" dur="3.87">right now and most of the people are</text>
  <text start="159.2" dur="5.73">totally oblivious to what is happening</text>
  <text start="161.12" dur="5.85">so let&amp;#39;s look at this we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="164.93" dur="4.29">this chart here and the chart shows that</text>
  <text start="166.97" dur="6.15">the average duration of unemployment</text>
  <text start="169.22" dur="6.78">since the late 1940s and what the chart</text>
  <text start="173.12" dur="6.15">the chart shows is that workers remain</text>
  <text start="176" dur="6.329">unemployed far longer than they did in</text>
  <text start="179.27" dur="7.86">the good old days but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="182.329" dur="6.481">here is that in today&amp;#39;s world</text>
  <text start="187.13" dur="4.98">something very interesting is happening</text>
  <text start="188.81" dur="5.58">the duration of unemployment is really</text>
  <text start="192.11" dur="4.83">starting to spike up again quite</text>
  <text start="194.39" dur="5.46">dramatically and that is very very</text>
  <text start="196.94" dur="5.16">troubling a very troubling sign for the</text>
  <text start="199.85" dur="6.06">US economy overall because spikes in</text>
  <text start="202.1" dur="8.49">this number almost always scar</text>
  <text start="205.91" dur="7.23">correspond with a recession so the</text>
  <text start="210.59" dur="3.36">Bureau of Labor Statistics says that we</text>
  <text start="213.14" dur="3.39">don&amp;#39;t have anything to be concerned</text>
  <text start="213.95" dur="4.35">about they&amp;#39;re blaming all the bad</text>
  <text start="216.53" dur="3.96">numbers on Harvey and Irma and</text>
  <text start="218.3" dur="3.39">everything else but we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="220.49" dur="3.24">this we&amp;#39;ve been tracking this we</text>
  <text start="221.69" dur="5.1">understand that this has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="223.73" dur="5.64">with these little storms or these storms</text>
  <text start="226.79" dur="5.94">that create a disaster in a small pocket</text>
  <text start="229.37" dur="6.63">area because that will pass and these</text>
  <text start="232.73" dur="5.34">numbers will continually decline we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="236" dur="3.87">see the same problems nothing will</text>
  <text start="238.07" dur="3.72">change him all they do during this time</text>
  <text start="239.87" dur="4.59">period is they manipulate the numbers</text>
  <text start="241.79" dur="5.27">further to explain away why all this is</text>
  <text start="244.46" dur="5.61">happening and we&amp;#39;re getting word from</text>
  <text start="247.06" dur="5.71">many different institutions Bank of</text>
  <text start="250.07" dur="5.13">America City a lot of the financial</text>
  <text start="252.77" dur="4.8">pundits even the central banks of</text>
  <text start="255.2" dur="4.47">central banks are warning that we have</text>
  <text start="257.57" dur="3.93">major problems in the economy because</text>
  <text start="259.67" dur="3.45">they understand that eventually it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.5" dur="3.57">going to be coming down now of course</text>
  <text start="263.12" dur="3.24">this is all gonna be blamed on something</text>
  <text start="265.07" dur="2.79">else they&amp;#39;ll pretend that they had</text>
  <text start="266.36" dur="5.19">nothing to do with it and right now</text>
  <text start="267.86" dur="7.74">Wolfgang Shia is out there and he is</text>
  <text start="271.55" dur="7.32">warning that the world is in danger of</text>
  <text start="275.6" dur="6.62">encouraging new bubbles that they are</text>
  <text start="278.87" dur="5.85">forming right now and the global debt is</text>
  <text start="282.22" dur="6.25">spiraling out of control</text>
  <text start="284.72" dur="7.05">and we&amp;#39;re hearing a lot of warnings like</text>
  <text start="288.47" dur="6.09">this and we can see that all these</text>
  <text start="291.77" dur="5.55">individuals who are leaving office</text>
  <text start="294.56" dur="6.09">resigning they&amp;#39;re all giving the same</text>
  <text start="297.32" dur="5.04">exact warning now he said there was a</text>
  <text start="300.65" dur="3.96">danger of new bubbles forming due to</text>
  <text start="302.36" dur="3.78">trillions of dollars that the central</text>
  <text start="304.61" dur="3.96">banks have pumped into the markets</text>
  <text start="306.14" dur="5.16">Charla also warned a risk of stability</text>
  <text start="308.57" dur="4.95">in the eurozone particularly those posed</text>
  <text start="311.3" dur="4.17">by bank balance sheets burden by the</text>
  <text start="313.52" dur="6.899">post-crisis legacy of non-performing</text>
  <text start="315.47" dur="5.46">loans since around 2012 now again this</text>
  <text start="320.419" dur="2.611">issue</text>
  <text start="320.93" dur="5.43">with non-performing loans remains</text>
  <text start="323.03" dur="4.65">largely unresolved now economists all</text>
  <text start="326.36" dur="3.029">over the world are concerned about the</text>
  <text start="327.68" dur="3.239">increased risk arising from the</text>
  <text start="329.389" dur="3.87">accumulation of more and more liquidity</text>
  <text start="330.919" dur="6.391">and growth of public and private debt</text>
  <text start="333.259" dur="6.451">and these individuals are starting to</text>
  <text start="337.31" dur="5.01">realize that everything all this debt</text>
  <text start="339.71" dur="6.269">everything that we&amp;#39;re seeing cannot be</text>
  <text start="342.32" dur="6.27">sustained the way the world is today</text>
  <text start="345.979" dur="3.511">now of course the globalists were</text>
  <text start="348.59" dur="2.97">planning on something completely</text>
  <text start="349.49" dur="3.84">different they were planning on having</text>
  <text start="351.56" dur="3.62">the trade deal evening out the playing</text>
  <text start="353.33" dur="5.07">field amongst all these countries and</text>
  <text start="355.18" dur="5.17">bringing us to war to get rid of this</text>
  <text start="358.4" dur="3.81">problem they are still doing the same</text>
  <text start="360.35" dur="3.599">thing but they&amp;#39;re having a very</text>
  <text start="362.21" dur="4.41">difficult time doing this because the</text>
  <text start="363.949" dur="6.181">globalists are not that much in control</text>
  <text start="366.62" dur="5.669">they&amp;#39;re still there but we can see there</text>
  <text start="370.13" dur="4.59">are other factions that are fighting</text>
  <text start="372.289" dur="4.38">this right now and they wanted the TPP</text>
  <text start="374.72" dur="3.69">they wanted to control the different</text>
  <text start="376.669" dur="5.25">countries why having a court that laid</text>
  <text start="378.41" dur="6.3">above the government which would allow</text>
  <text start="381.919" dur="6.091">them to control the countries and at</text>
  <text start="384.71" dur="6.36">this point all they have left is to</text>
  <text start="388.01" dur="5.31">start an event start an event and blame</text>
  <text start="391.07" dur="5.099">this entire economic collapse on</text>
  <text start="393.32" dur="6.99">something completely different maybe a</text>
  <text start="396.169" dur="5.701">country maybe a group maybe a terrorist</text>
  <text start="400.31" dur="3.96">organization it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter</text>
  <text start="401.87" dur="4.62">they don&amp;#39;t want to be blamed for this</text>
  <text start="404.27" dur="4.2">and we can see that they understand that</text>
  <text start="406.49" dur="3.69">this is coming very very soon this is</text>
  <text start="408.47" dur="4.37">why they&amp;#39;re manipulating all the numbers</text>
  <text start="410.18" dur="4.709">to the max at this point we see out in</text>
  <text start="412.84" dur="4.359">Catalonia things are really heating up</text>
  <text start="414.889" dur="5.46">there we see the Spanish government the</text>
  <text start="417.199" dur="5.701">Catalonian Parliament they are battling</text>
  <text start="420.349" dur="5.94">right now and we&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="422.9" dur="5.489">situation and we might see some type of</text>
  <text start="426.289" dur="4.62">violence we might see some riots we</text>
  <text start="428.389" dur="3.84">might see a civil war and I mentioned</text>
  <text start="430.909" dur="4.171">this before but we can see right now</text>
  <text start="432.229" dur="5.901">that the Catalonia and Parliament they</text>
  <text start="435.08" dur="7.079">are going to debate about secession and</text>
  <text start="438.13" dur="5.92">they&amp;#39;re looking to leave Spain and of</text>
  <text start="442.159" dur="3.391">course Spain doesn&amp;#39;t want this to happen</text>
  <text start="444.05" dur="2.609">EU doesn&amp;#39;t want this to happen the</text>
  <text start="445.55" dur="4.2">United States doesn&amp;#39;t want this to</text>
  <text start="446.659" dur="4.201">happen and we see that this is a huge</text>
  <text start="449.75" dur="4.52">possibility</text>
  <text start="450.86" dur="7.22">now what would Spain lose if cattle</text>
  <text start="454.27" dur="5.7">becomes independent well Catalonia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="458.08" dur="4.22">population is about seven point five two</text>
  <text start="459.97" dur="5.31">million their gross domestic product is</text>
  <text start="462.3" dur="7.72">around two hundred and eleven million</text>
  <text start="465.28" dur="9.51">euros we see that international exports</text>
  <text start="470.02" dur="7.11">are around 65 billion euros and we can</text>
  <text start="474.79" dur="4.95">see at this point that they would lose a</text>
  <text start="477.13" dur="6.03">lot of this and this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="479.74" dur="5.85">very very worried about and the</text>
  <text start="483.16" dur="4.14">independence for catalonia it has been a</text>
  <text start="485.59" dur="3.42">long time coming they&amp;#39;ve been trying to</text>
  <text start="487.3" dur="3.18">push this for a very long time this is</text>
  <text start="489.01" dur="4.89">not like it just popped out of nowhere</text>
  <text start="490.48" dur="6.38">and here we are now Trump is out there</text>
  <text start="493.9" dur="5.43">and he is talking about North Korea and</text>
  <text start="496.86" dur="3.82">basically saying that you know something</text>
  <text start="499.33" dur="2.93">is coming down the pike and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="500.68" dur="4.77">new report that was released by author</text>
  <text start="502.26" dur="5.8">Michael zakharik he calculates that an</text>
  <text start="505.45" dur="5.4">all-out nuclear strike launched by North</text>
  <text start="508.06" dur="5.16">Korea against Tokyo or Seoul could kill</text>
  <text start="510.85" dur="5.61">as many as 2.1 million people and injure</text>
  <text start="513.22" dur="4.74">another 8 million now combined the</text>
  <text start="516.46" dur="3.5">number of dead and injured would equal</text>
  <text start="517.96" dur="4.35">around 10% of South Korean population</text>
  <text start="519.96" dur="4.87">affirming that a nuclear strike by the</text>
  <text start="522.31" dur="4.77">north would be a considerable margin the</text>
  <text start="524.83" dur="4.74">single deadliest attack in human history</text>
  <text start="527.08" dur="3.63">by comparison is the u.s. which killed</text>
  <text start="529.57" dur="3.39">around a hundred and twenty thousand</text>
  <text start="530.71" dur="4.92">Japanese civilians when it dropped there</text>
  <text start="532.96" dur="5.7">the nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and</text>
  <text start="535.63" dur="6.45">Nagasaki now in the most likely scenario</text>
  <text start="538.66" dur="5.45">an accidental miscalculation during a</text>
  <text start="542.08" dur="5.18">missile or nuclear test in the Pacific</text>
  <text start="544.11" dur="5.56">impacts the US military assets in Guam</text>
  <text start="547.26" dur="4.48">triggering an overwhelming military</text>
  <text start="549.67" dur="5.4">response by the US and things get</text>
  <text start="551.74" dur="5.25">completely out of hand and I still</text>
  <text start="555.07" dur="4.62">believe from what has been going on in</text>
  <text start="556.99" dur="4.65">the background I think there is a lot of</text>
  <text start="559.69" dur="4.92">talks going on between Russia China the</text>
  <text start="561.64" dur="5.55">EU Tillerson through backchannels trying</text>
  <text start="564.61" dur="4.38">to calm the situation down Trump is out</text>
  <text start="567.19" dur="3.51">in the forefront letting the corporate</text>
  <text start="568.99" dur="5.01">media and all those neocons and the</text>
  <text start="570.7" dur="5.27">Cabal think that we are going to war but</text>
  <text start="574" dur="5.37">we can see that things are actually</text>
  <text start="575.97" dur="5.65">changing everywhere remember the Cabal</text>
  <text start="579.37" dur="4.86">went into many different countries Sudan</text>
  <text start="581.62" dur="4.32">Iraq Lebanon Libya they wanted the end</text>
  <text start="584.23" dur="3.21">of Syria they wanted to get into Iran</text>
  <text start="585.94" dur="3.96">and all of</text>
  <text start="587.44" dur="4.14">is falling apart right now now Trump</text>
  <text start="589.9" dur="4.17">just did something very interesting</text>
  <text start="591.58" dur="7.37">now remember Sudan wasn&amp;#39;t cooperating</text>
  <text start="594.07" dur="7.65">and they placed sanctions on Sudan and</text>
  <text start="598.95" dur="5.89">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="601.72" dur="6.24">u.s. just lifted the economic sanctions</text>
  <text start="604.84" dur="4.68">on Sudan now the United States their</text>
  <text start="607.96" dur="4.05">reasoning for this is saying that they</text>
  <text start="609.52" dur="4.47">made a huge amount of progress fighting</text>
  <text start="612.01" dur="4.86">terrorism and easing human rights</text>
  <text start="613.99" dur="4.77">situation in the country and we can see</text>
  <text start="616.87" dur="3.84">right now what is really happening is</text>
  <text start="618.76" dur="5.22">everything that was put in place by</text>
  <text start="620.71" dur="5.7">Obama and before Obama everything is</text>
  <text start="623.98" dur="4.77">starting to be removed again if you look</text>
  <text start="626.41" dur="5.79">at the serious situation we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="628.75" dur="6.54">invade with more troops Russia and Assad</text>
  <text start="632.2" dur="5.16">they are pushing the terrorists out we</text>
  <text start="635.29" dur="5.13">didn&amp;#39;t bring in more troops into the</text>
  <text start="637.36" dur="5.16">area actually things are basically</text>
  <text start="640.42" dur="4.47">falling apart there for the paid</text>
  <text start="642.52" dur="5.25">mercenary which is then pushing out the</text>
  <text start="644.89" dur="5.64">US troops because right now the people</text>
  <text start="647.77" dur="5.16">in Syria they don&amp;#39;t want a separate</text>
  <text start="650.53" dur="4.35">country they want their country to be</text>
  <text start="652.93" dur="4.17">unified they don&amp;#39;t want this to be</text>
  <text start="654.88" dur="6.06">separated now out in Turkey we can see</text>
  <text start="657.1" dur="7.2">that the u.s. decided to suspend all</text>
  <text start="660.94" dur="5.46">non-emergent visas in Turkey and we can</text>
  <text start="664.3" dur="4.68">see that Turkey is moving towards Russia</text>
  <text start="666.4" dur="4.5">we see that German has removed its</text>
  <text start="668.98" dur="4.02">military assets from Turkey moved to</text>
  <text start="670.9" dur="3.66">Jordan the United States right now put</text>
  <text start="673" dur="2.94">out this memo saying that recent events</text>
  <text start="674.56" dur="3.3">have forced the United States government</text>

  <text start="807.85" dur="3.989">it&amp;#39;s time to have our own piece of land</text>
  <text start="809.11" dur="5.91">the United States came in built the</text>

  <text start="837.1" dur="4.92">have soldiers on the ground like they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="839.02" dur="4.77">done in Iraq and Syria so we could see</text>
  <text start="842.02" dur="3.39">that things are definitely you know a</text>
  <text start="843.79" dur="3.39">little bit out of whack when the</text>
  <text start="845.41" dur="3.9">corporate media is reporting all of this</text>
  <text start="847.18" dur="4.05">but we see at this point that the people</text>
  <text start="849.31" dur="3.96">of Syria the people of Iraq they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="851.23" dur="3.81">want to have their country separated</text>
  <text start="853.27" dur="3.119">right now they&amp;#39;re not at that</text>
  <text start="855.04" dur="3.359">they&amp;#39;re just they just want their</text>
  <text start="856.389" dur="5.07">country back they want the United States</text>
  <text start="858.399" dur="5.75">to get out they don&amp;#39;t want war anymore</text>
  <text start="861.459" dur="6.091">they want to rebuild their country and</text>
  <text start="864.149" dur="4.961">again this is all these people want but</text>
  <text start="867.55" dur="2.37">we can see that the Cabal is losing</text>
  <text start="869.11" dur="3.149">control</text>
  <text start="869.92" dur="6.18">in all these areas lost control Sudan</text>
  <text start="872.259" dur="6.06">now and it&amp;#39;s continually spreading we</text>
  <text start="876.1" dur="3.9">see that the intelligence agencies</text>
  <text start="878.319" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;re trying to make their case that</text>
  <text start="880" dur="7.13">Kaspersky Labs they are infiltrating the</text>
  <text start="884.139" dur="5.101">NSA and they&amp;#39;re hacking into things and</text>
  <text start="887.13" dur="4.149">Kaspersky came out and said yeah this is</text>
  <text start="889.24" dur="4.32">completely fake phony and false and the</text>
  <text start="891.279" dur="6.48">founder of Kaspersky Eugene Kaspersky</text>
  <text start="893.56" dur="7.05">mocked the claim that Kaspersky was</text>
  <text start="897.759" dur="5.64">actually hacking into the NSA and</text>
  <text start="900.61" dur="4.649">stealing information and passing it to</text>
  <text start="903.399" dur="4.231">the Russian government he&amp;#39;s saying the</text>
  <text start="905.259" dur="4.14">real explanation for all this data loss</text>
  <text start="907.63" dur="4.86">is that the NSA tools on the computer</text>
  <text start="909.399" dur="5.761">were correct correctly identified as new</text>
  <text start="912.49" dur="6.899">forms of malware by Kaspersky and the</text>
  <text start="915.16" dur="6.81">NSA got caught and their software allows</text>
  <text start="919.389" dur="4.5">them to detect this this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="921.97" dur="4.559">been asking the corporations in the</text>
  <text start="923.889" dur="6.781">United States to get rid of Kaspersky</text>
  <text start="926.529" dur="7.591">because that picks up their spy malware</text>
  <text start="930.67" dur="4.979">on the systems and if all these</text>
  <text start="934.12" dur="3.269">countries or if all these companies are</text>
  <text start="935.649" dur="3.87">using it they&amp;#39;re gonna start detecting</text>
  <text start="937.389" dur="3.991">it and saying wait what is this why is</text>
  <text start="939.519" dur="3.481">this piece of malware on here what is it</text>
  <text start="941.38" dur="3.66">doing and they&amp;#39;re gonna figure out</text>
  <text start="943" dur="4.829">exactly what it&amp;#39;s doing and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="945.04" dur="4.529">gonna realize this was from the NSA this</text>
  <text start="947.829" dur="4.831">is why they&amp;#39;re putting up this ban</text>
  <text start="949.569" dur="5.281">saying lo hey get rid of this you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="952.66" dur="3.84">need it nobody should be using it you</text>
  <text start="954.85" dur="3.539">should be using the stuff here in the</text>
  <text start="956.5" dur="3.839">United States because of course the CIA</text>
  <text start="958.389" dur="3.68">the intelligence agencies they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="960.339" dur="4.62">involved in where they&amp;#39;re you know</text>
  <text start="962.069" dur="6.76">creating this software not to pick it up</text>
  <text start="964.959" dur="5.971">so the u.s. made homegrown detection</text>
  <text start="968.829" dur="4.141">will never pick up this stuff and this</text>
  <text start="970.93" dur="3.99">is why they&amp;#39;re coming out with all this</text>
  <text start="972.97" dur="3.45">type of stuff because they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="974.92" dur="3.419">worried that they&amp;#39;re gonna be found out</text>
  <text start="976.42" dur="3.659">and guess what the truth is always going</text>
  <text start="978.339" dur="4.021">to come out it&amp;#39;s always going to surface</text>
  <text start="980.079" dur="4.021">to the top it might take a short period</text>
  <text start="982.36" dur="3.12">of time it might take a long period of</text>
  <text start="984.1" dur="3.63">time but eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="985.48" dur="3.09">happen people will start learning the</text>
  <text start="987.73" dur="2.22">truth</text>
  <text start="988.57" dur="3.33">it&amp;#39;s a little bit different going back</text>
  <text start="989.95" dur="2.67">in years where we had a listen to the</text>
  <text start="991.9" dur="3.3">newspaper</text>
  <text start="992.62" dur="4.38">we had a listen to television maybe</text>
  <text start="995.2" dur="4.14">people you know heard about things on</text>
  <text start="997" dur="3.9">shortwave radio but today we have the</text>
  <text start="999.34" dur="3.33">Internet where a lot of people can go</text>
  <text start="1000.9" dur="2.94">out and do research they can look at</text>
  <text start="1002.67" dur="3.24">different things they can go to the</text>
  <text start="1003.84" dur="3.72">sites they can really see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1005.91" dur="3.27">happening they can film what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1007.56" dur="3.24">people can pass it around they can</text>
  <text start="1009.18" dur="5.04">analyze it they can understand it and</text>
  <text start="1010.8" dur="5.43">things are definitely changing and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1014.22" dur="3.96">becoming harder and harder for these</text>
  <text start="1016.23" dur="3.93">groups to get away with all this stuff</text>
  <text start="1018.18" dur="4.35">and as more and more people you know</text>
  <text start="1020.16" dur="3.99">awaken to this fact it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="1022.53" dur="3.75">even harder and this is why we have to</text>
  <text start="1024.15" dur="3.9">spread the message because as more and</text>
  <text start="1026.28" dur="3.87">more people know about this and more and</text>
  <text start="1028.05" dur="4.76">more people think about this and more</text>
  <text start="1030.15" dur="5.43">and more people look at it guess what</text>
  <text start="1032.81" dur="6.01">those individuals who are non elected</text>
  <text start="1035.58" dur="5.82">they lose power because all you have to</text>
  <text start="1038.82" dur="5.19">do is continually show no you&amp;#39;re lying</text>
  <text start="1041.4" dur="5.52">no you&amp;#39;re lying and you keep doing this</text>
  <text start="1044.01" dur="4.59">until guess what they can&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="1046.92" dur="2.73">anymore and this is what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1048.6" dur="3.66">right now because every time something</text>
  <text start="1049.65" dur="5.01">happens we call them out on it now look</text>
  <text start="1052.26" dur="4.65">at the Vegas shooting I mean there are</text>
  <text start="1054.66" dur="5.46">many many individuals on YouTube</text>
  <text start="1056.91" dur="5.52">pointing out all these irregularities of</text>
  <text start="1060.12" dur="3.18">what is happening here even the Clark</text>
  <text start="1062.43" dur="3.42">County Sheriff</text>
  <text start="1063.3" dur="6.81">Lombardo said something very interesting</text>
  <text start="1065.85" dur="6.6">saying listen the gunman Steven panic he</text>
  <text start="1070.11" dur="5.22">had a half he had to have some type of</text>
  <text start="1072.45" dur="4.05">help during this whole entire thing</text>
  <text start="1075.33" dur="2.73">there&amp;#39;s no way he brought all this</text>
  <text start="1076.5" dur="3.39">weapons and set up the electronics</text>
  <text start="1078.06" dur="3.96">figured out all the calculations of</text>
  <text start="1079.89" dur="4.38">where he had to be perched and he was</text>
  <text start="1082.02" dur="4.86">able to do all of this by himself it</text>
  <text start="1084.27" dur="4.41">just doesn&amp;#39;t make sense and there is</text>
  <text start="1086.88" dur="4.23">more and more individuals out there</text>
  <text start="1088.68" dur="5.16">saying no there are many more people</text>
  <text start="1091.11" dur="5.4">that involved in it or that are involved</text>
  <text start="1093.84" dur="3.78">in this or seeing video of something on</text>
  <text start="1096.51" dur="2.37">the fourth floor if people are saying</text>
  <text start="1097.62" dur="3.63">there&amp;#39;s other shooters that were on the</text>
  <text start="1098.88" dur="4.8">ground and investigators right now are</text>
  <text start="1101.25" dur="4.65">puzzled by two discoveries first a</text>
  <text start="1103.68" dur="4.17">charger was found that does not match</text>
  <text start="1105.9" dur="5.52">any of the cell phones that belonged to</text>
  <text start="1107.85" dur="5.13">the gunman a second a garage record</text>
  <text start="1111.42" dur="4.68">shows that during a period one panics</text>
  <text start="1112.98" dur="6">car left the hotel garage one of his key</text>
  <text start="1116.1" dur="6.31">cards we was used to get into his room</text>
  <text start="1118.98" dur="7.51">so here we are right now again</text>
  <text start="1122.41" dur="7.2">where there are definite irregularities</text>
  <text start="1126.49" dur="6.75">in the entire story but it gets better</text>
  <text start="1129.61" dur="6.42">according to paradox IRS IRS records the</text>
  <text start="1133.24" dur="5.19">gunman was not only a legacy millionaire</text>
  <text start="1136.03" dur="6.87">he was a successful gambler earning at</text>
  <text start="1138.43" dur="6.84">least 5 million dollars in 2015 some of</text>
  <text start="1142.9" dur="5.19">that could be from other investments but</text>
  <text start="1145.27" dur="6.06">most of it was from gambling so he was</text>
  <text start="1148.09" dur="4.98">very wealthy and we see at this point</text>
  <text start="1151.33" dur="4.71">that everything that they&amp;#39;re putting out</text>
  <text start="1153.07" dur="5.58">there should be questioned the photo of</text>
  <text start="1156.04" dur="5.67">him on the ground in the hotel room and</text>
  <text start="1158.65" dur="6.05">the gun over his foot this crazy suicide</text>
  <text start="1161.71" dur="6.69">note just perfectly all placed out</text>
  <text start="1164.7" dur="5.77">exactly just like a movie set and we can</text>
  <text start="1168.4" dur="3.66">see right now that more and more</text>
  <text start="1170.47" dur="3.03">individuals are going to be looking into</text>
  <text start="1172.06" dur="3.6">this they&amp;#39;re more and more evidence is</text>
  <text start="1173.5" dur="3.48">going to be coming out and everything</text>
  <text start="1175.66" dur="4.01">needs to be questioned you need to</text>
  <text start="1176.98" dur="6.57">question everything all the time until</text>
  <text start="1179.67" dur="5.77">it makes sense because when they tell</text>
  <text start="1183.55" dur="4.43">you something and you see different</text>
  <text start="1185.44" dur="5.19">images you see different information</text>
  <text start="1187.98" dur="4.81">guess what it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense think</text>
  <text start="1190.63" dur="3.93">about what they do here each shooting</text>
  <text start="1192.79" dur="6.69">they always tell you that the person had</text>
  <text start="1194.56" dur="7.14">30 guns 40 guns do you really need 3040</text>
  <text start="1199.48" dur="4.01">guns if you&amp;#39;re the only one shooting I</text>
  <text start="1201.7" dur="4.83">mean why would you bring a shotgun</text>
  <text start="1203.49" dur="6.37">pistols why do you need so many because</text>
  <text start="1206.53" dur="6.84">you can reload you don&amp;#39;t I mean you</text>
  <text start="1209.86" dur="6.57">can&amp;#39;t handle all of those weapons it</text>
  <text start="1213.37" dur="5.25">makes no sense but they do it because it</text>
  <text start="1216.43" dur="4.71">makes it seem shocking like he brought</text>
  <text start="1218.62" dur="4.26">in all these weapons he was going to do</text>
  <text start="1221.14" dur="5.19">something even more than what he did and</text>
  <text start="1222.88" dur="4.8">this is how they staged this and when</text>
  <text start="1226.33" dur="2.91">you look at all the evidence and you</text>
  <text start="1227.68" dur="3.24">look at everything&amp;#39;s going on a lot of</text>
  <text start="1229.24" dur="3.27">it starting to fall apart just like</text>
  <text start="1230.92" dur="3.39">everything out in the Middle East just</text>
  <text start="1232.51" dur="3.57">like the economy all the numbers that</text>
  <text start="1234.31" dur="4.5">they throw us all the propaganda because</text>
  <text start="1236.08" dur="6.09">propaganda is only as good as when you</text>
  <text start="1238.81" dur="7.74">can keep the lie up once you show proof</text>
  <text start="1242.17" dur="6.15">and the truth propaganda disappears very</text>
  <text start="1246.55" dur="2.79">very quickly because there&amp;#39;s nothing to</text>
  <text start="1248.32" dur="3.51">back it up just like the Russian</text>
  <text start="1249.34" dur="4.23">collusion they kept it they kept it up</text>
  <text start="1251.83" dur="4.29">on the news Russian collusion Russian</text>
  <text start="1253.57" dur="5.1">collusion Russian collusion guess what</text>
  <text start="1256.12" dur="4.62">they can&amp;#39;t do anything with it because</text>
