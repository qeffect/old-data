  <text start="146.26" dur="6.87">accounts they were created they were not</text>
  <text start="149.35" dur="5.88">Michael Flynn&amp;#39;s accounts and she went on</text>
  <text start="153.13" dur="4.199">to say that what do you mean these are</text>
  <text start="155.23" dur="4.17">fake these aren&amp;#39;t his Twitter accounts</text>
  <text start="157.329" dur="6.69">this is not what he said and the whole</text>
  <text start="159.4" dur="7.11">thing was a joke on her but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="164.019" dur="5.03">seeing here is that the corporate media</text>
  <text start="166.51" dur="7.62">is out there and they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="169.049" dur="7.75">propaganda right now to finish off the</text>
  <text start="174.13" dur="5.55">Trump administration but when we go</text>
  <text start="176.799" dur="4.981">underneath all of this we really see</text>
  <text start="179.68" dur="4.83">that there&amp;#39;s problems</text>
  <text start="181.78" dur="4.71">in the White House there are these</text>
  <text start="184.51" dur="3.84">leakers that are leaking a lot of</text>
  <text start="186.49" dur="6.48">information and House Intelligence</text>
  <text start="188.35" dur="7.08">Committee Chairman Devin Nunez said that</text>
  <text start="192.97" dur="3.78">those who leaked the contents of former</text>
  <text start="195.43" dur="4.34">national security adviser Michael</text>
  <text start="196.75" dur="6.36">Flynn&amp;#39;s phone calls belong in jail</text>
  <text start="199.77" dur="7.36">that&amp;#39;s nine leakers that all belong in</text>
  <text start="203.11" dur="5.4">jail he said they broke the law and he</text>
  <text start="207.13" dur="4.29">went to look to see if there was a</text>
  <text start="208.51" dur="6.479">warrant for them to tap the phones from</text>
  <text start="211.42" dur="5.97">the FBI and there was no warrant</text>
  <text start="214.989" dur="4.951">whatsoever to listen he said to an</text>
  <text start="217.39" dur="5.09">American phone call you have to go to</text>
  <text start="219.94" dur="6.09">court you have to fill out paperwork and</text>
  <text start="222.48" dur="6.49">right now he cannot find any he says it</text>
  <text start="226.03" dur="7.709">doesn&amp;#39;t exist and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="228.97" dur="8.94">right now is that those individuals they</text>
  <text start="233.739" dur="7.101">leaked information from the White House</text>
  <text start="237.91" dur="6.42">this is a national security issue and</text>
  <text start="240.84" dur="4.59">they violated the rights of this</text>
  <text start="244.33" dur="4.5">individual</text>
  <text start="245.43" dur="5.05">because they need to get a warrant now</text>
  <text start="248.83" dur="3.719">of course throw everyone looking at this</text>
  <text start="250.48" dur="3.99">saying well he shouldn&amp;#39;t have been</text>
  <text start="252.549" dur="3.69">having these phone calls but yes he</text>
  <text start="254.47" dur="5.78">shouldn&amp;#39;t have been but they obtained</text>
  <text start="256.239" dur="6.781">this illegally and I hate to say this</text>
  <text start="260.25" dur="4.99">going back in time when we had the</text>
  <text start="263.02" dur="4.77">transition teams of all different</text>
  <text start="265.24" dur="4.71">presidencies they all did the same thing</text>
  <text start="267.79" dur="5.34">they knew they were coming into office</text>
  <text start="269.95" dur="5">the Electoral College already decided</text>
  <text start="273.13" dur="5.099">that yes this is the president</text>
  <text start="274.95" dur="4.98">the team&amp;#39;s already said okay these are</text>
  <text start="278.229" dur="6.571">going to be part of my transition team</text>
  <text start="279.93" dur="6.7">start making contacts and we can see</text>
  <text start="284.8" dur="3.78">that most of the individuals most of the</text>
  <text start="286.63" dur="4.56">presidencies going back in time well</text>
  <text start="288.58" dur="6.78">they did the same exact thing but no one</text>
  <text start="291.19" dur="6.3">called them out on this but Michael</text>
  <text start="295.36" dur="4.65">Flynn he gave in his resignation letter</text>
  <text start="297.49" dur="3.87">and I don&amp;#39;t think he should have done</text>
  <text start="300.01" dur="3.27">this at this point I think they should</text>
  <text start="301.36" dur="3.72">have said you know something let&amp;#39;s go up</text>
  <text start="303.28" dur="4.86">against this because it looks like they</text>
  <text start="305.08" dur="6.269">folded too quickly on this and after</text>
  <text start="308.14" dur="4.56">examining Flynn&amp;#39;s letter to glaring</text>
  <text start="311.349" dur="3.771">things stand out first</text>
  <text start="312.7" dur="3.83">his strong rebuke of the</text>
  <text start="315.12" dur="3.03">liberal media over their</text>
  <text start="316.53" dur="4.169">characterization of the events leading</text>
  <text start="318.15" dur="4.43">up to his resignation Flynn describes</text>
  <text start="320.699" dur="4.861">his calls with Russian ambassador as</text>
  <text start="322.58" dur="5.86">standard practice in any transition of</text>
  <text start="325.56" dur="5.34">this magnitude even though the liberal</text>
  <text start="328.44" dur="4.199">media was incorrectly suggesting such</text>
  <text start="330.9" dur="2.88">communications violated the Logan Act</text>
  <text start="332.639" dur="4.411">which the FBI and Justice Department</text>
  <text start="333.78" dur="6.24">officials insist is wrong so right off</text>
  <text start="337.05" dur="7.11">the bat they&amp;#39;re saying that yeah this</text>
  <text start="340.02" dur="6.33">doesn&amp;#39;t hold water second general Flynn</text>
  <text start="344.16" dur="4.35">destroys the failed Obama legacy on</text>
  <text start="346.35" dur="5.49">foreign policy which has been totally</text>
  <text start="348.51" dur="5.4">ignored by the media in his letter Flynn</text>
  <text start="351.84" dur="4.43">explains that President Trump has</text>
  <text start="353.91" dur="5.129">reoriented American foreign policy in</text>
  <text start="356.27" dur="5.04">fundamental ways to restore America&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="359.039" dur="5.491">leadership position in the world</text>
  <text start="361.31" dur="6.12">he said the Obama legacy is one of total</text>
  <text start="364.53" dur="6.23">failure which Americans rejected and</text>
  <text start="367.43" dur="6.67">this is why they voted for Trump and</text>
  <text start="370.76" dur="7.48">he&amp;#39;s right and one other thing to point</text>
  <text start="374.1" dur="6.03">out here is that remember the elite the</text>
  <text start="378.24" dur="4.2">central banks they&amp;#39;re running the</text>
  <text start="380.13" dur="6.75">country they hold all the cards they</text>
  <text start="382.44" dur="7.8">hold all the keys they want Trump to</text>
  <text start="386.88" dur="5.49">fall in line they want war with Russia</text>
  <text start="390.24" dur="6.54">they don&amp;#39;t want him making peace with</text>
  <text start="392.37" dur="8.31">Russia and they&amp;#39;re trying to force him</text>
  <text start="396.78" dur="6.449">into a position where he gives that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="400.68" dur="6.06">what this is all about if he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="403.229" dur="5.701">give in they&amp;#39;re going to get rid of him</text>
  <text start="406.74" dur="6.209">now the New York Times is pushing this</text>
  <text start="408.93" dur="8.1">quite hard they put out a news article</text>
  <text start="412.949" dur="6.931">and the news article says Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="417.03" dur="4.8">aides had repeated contacts with Russian</text>
  <text start="419.88" dur="4.65">intelligence now of course when you read</text>
  <text start="421.83" dur="5.76">the headline you go oh oh my god this is</text>
  <text start="424.53" dur="5.1">unbelievable and this is why Flynn left</text>
  <text start="427.59" dur="4.98">and now there&amp;#39;s others that are involved</text>
  <text start="429.63" dur="6.24">in this but something very important</text>
  <text start="432.57" dur="8.34">about all of this is that they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="435.87" dur="6.66">find any evidence of collusion now if</text>
  <text start="440.91" dur="4.439">you look at the bottom of their article</text>
  <text start="442.53" dur="5.73">close to the bottom it&amp;#39;s kind of buried</text>
  <text start="445.349" dur="3.631">in there and they said that there are no</text>
  <text start="448.26" dur="4.13">facts there</text>
  <text start="448.98" dur="5.61">no evidence the FBI supports this so</text>
  <text start="452.39" dur="5.2">when you look at this you would say well</text>
  <text start="454.59" dur="6.18">wait a minute is this article based on</text>
  <text start="457.59" dur="7.89">anything no it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not even based</text>
  <text start="460.77" dur="7.11">on facts the facts are nothing was found</text>
  <text start="465.48" dur="6.45">there&amp;#39;s no evidence and the FBI confirms</text>
  <text start="467.88" dur="6.54">this an aria Fletcher says well why does</text>
  <text start="471.93" dur="5.28">the headline say Trump campaign aides</text>
  <text start="474.42" dur="5.87">had reported contacts with Russian</text>
  <text start="477.21" dur="6.93">intelligence shouldn&amp;#39;t the headline</text>
  <text start="480.29" dur="6.28">actually say officials say no evidence</text>
  <text start="484.14" dur="5.88">of cooperation between Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="486.57" dur="6.69">and Russia but you can see how the</text>
  <text start="490.02" dur="5.13">corporate media spins all of this and</text>
  <text start="493.26" dur="4.86">they do it on purpose</text>
  <text start="495.15" dur="4.68">remember this is propaganda when you see</text>
  <text start="498.12" dur="3.09">these type of headlines this is</text>
  <text start="499.83" dur="4.26">propaganda I wonder if Google and</text>
  <text start="501.21" dur="4.82">Facebook and the rest are striking these</text>
  <text start="504.09" dur="7.59">down saying this is complete fake news</text>
  <text start="506.03" dur="8.74">most likely not now Russia is out there</text>
  <text start="511.68" dur="5.22">and they&amp;#39;re saying well they&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="514.77" dur="5.22">contacted any Russian spies that we know</text>
  <text start="516.9" dur="5.28">of and the person that they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="519.99" dur="4.77">that they&amp;#39;re looking at is mr. manna</text>
  <text start="522.18" dur="4.53">fort saying listen I do business in</text>
  <text start="524.76" dur="4.65">Russia I speak to many individuals in</text>
  <text start="526.71" dur="3.84">Russia the businessmen in Russia don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="529.41" dur="3.03">tell me that hey I&amp;#39;m a Russian</text>
  <text start="530.55" dur="3.87">intelligence agent they don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="532.44" dur="3.72">sign on them saying hi I&amp;#39;m a Russian</text>
  <text start="534.42" dur="3.81">intelligence agent because as we know in</text>
  <text start="536.16" dur="4.8">Russia and Ukraine a lot of the</text>
  <text start="538.23" dur="7.41">intelligence officials welp they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="540.96" dur="6.24">deeply embedded in society and again he</text>
  <text start="545.64" dur="3.66">has no knowledge of this now WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="547.2" dur="4.74">is out there saying you know the coals</text>
  <text start="549.3" dur="5.28">from Flynn those should be public and we</text>
  <text start="551.94" dur="5.55">should be able to hear exactly what this</text>
  <text start="554.58" dur="6.24">is all about if this is the route we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="557.49" dur="5.07">going and of course most likely they</text>
  <text start="560.82" dur="3.68">don&amp;#39;t want to release these because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="562.56" dur="5.94">going to show that nothing has happened</text>
  <text start="564.5" dur="6.4">just as the FBI other government</text>
  <text start="568.5" dur="5.49">officials already reported that there</text>
  <text start="570.9" dur="6.72">was no collusion so again this whole</text>
  <text start="573.99" dur="6.06">thing was completely fake now we know</text>
  <text start="577.62" dur="5.14">that judge Rowe part when he was looking</text>
  <text start="580.05" dur="4.26">at Trump&amp;#39;s immigration policies he said</text>
  <text start="582.76" dur="4.8">that you know where is your evidence</text>
  <text start="584.31" dur="4.75">where is your evidence that terrorism is</text>
  <text start="587.56" dur="4.62">coming from these seven different</text>
  <text start="589.06" dur="8.52">countries and you have to remember that</text>
  <text start="592.18" dur="10.02">the FBI CIA they were creating these</text>
  <text start="597.58" dur="7.41">patsies to scare us into believing that</text>
  <text start="602.2" dur="4.2">terrorism was here in this country that</text>
  <text start="604.99" dur="3.48">we had to go to the Middle East and</text>
  <text start="606.4" dur="4.5">fight terrorism that was the whole point</text>
  <text start="608.47" dur="5.28">of it and what happened as time went on</text>
  <text start="610.9" dur="6.3">is they wanted to bring immigrants into</text>
  <text start="613.75" dur="5.49">the country at the same time and anyone</text>
  <text start="617.2" dur="4.53">they can get because they were trying to</text>
  <text start="619.24" dur="3.81">pass the TPP so there were a lot of</text>
  <text start="621.73" dur="2.85">agendas going on we also had the</text>
  <text start="623.05" dur="3.06">elections coming up we also had</text>
  <text start="624.58" dur="3.9">Obamacare a lot of these individuals</text>
  <text start="626.11" dur="5.01">were exempt and we can see there was a</text>
  <text start="628.48" dur="4.26">lot of agendas associated with this so</text>
  <text start="631.12" dur="3.51">there were two agendas going on so in</text>
  <text start="632.74" dur="3.6">the beginning phases they were using</text>
  <text start="634.63" dur="3.15">terrorism because they needed more</text>
  <text start="636.34" dur="3.15">forces out in the Middle East because</text>
  <text start="637.78" dur="4.2">they were losing control of Libya</text>
  <text start="639.49" dur="3.9">Lebanon Iraq they wanted to get into</text>
  <text start="641.98" dur="2.91">Syria they wanted to bring more troops</text>
  <text start="643.39" dur="3.36">into Syria they wanted to bring more</text>
  <text start="644.89" dur="4.14">troops into Iraq and this is why they</text>
  <text start="646.75" dur="5.64">were pushing the idea of terrorism so</text>
  <text start="649.03" dur="6.39">hard and what happened was the corporate</text>
  <text start="652.39" dur="5.64">media they stopped reporting on a lot of</text>
  <text start="655.42" dur="6.57">all of the of what was going on because</text>
  <text start="658.03" dur="7.17">they got instructions from the elite the</text>
  <text start="661.99" dur="5.1">central bankers from Obama that we want</text>
  <text start="665.2" dur="3.51">the illegals to come in and if we say</text>
  <text start="667.09" dur="3.87">that some of them might be terrorists</text>
  <text start="668.71" dur="5.07">this is not going to work out very well</text>
  <text start="670.96" dur="4.2">so you&amp;#39;re gonna have to just ignore some</text>
  <text start="673.78" dur="3.12">of the things that are going on even</text>
  <text start="675.16" dur="3.72">though there&amp;#39;s other agencies that are</text>
  <text start="676.9" dur="4.32">setting up patsies we just have to</text>
  <text start="678.88" dur="4.2">ignore that right now except the big</text>
  <text start="681.22" dur="3.39">ones they can&amp;#39;t ignore you know like the</text>
  <text start="683.08" dur="3.3">San Bernardino shooting and all those</text>
  <text start="684.61" dur="4.44">other things but the smaller ones they</text>
  <text start="686.38" dur="4.92">completely ignored and Trump came up and</text>
  <text start="689.05" dur="4.32">said listen no I have a report here</text>
  <text start="691.3" dur="3.33">there are 72 terror convictions against</text>
  <text start="693.37" dur="3.75">people originating from the seven</text>
  <text start="694.63" dur="4.08">countries and of course judge Robart you</text>
  <text start="697.12" dur="5.22">know said there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s no such</text>
  <text start="698.71" dur="5.55">evidence whatsoever well Trump proved</text>

  <text start="823.24" dur="6.12">North Korea has every right to defend</text>
  <text start="826.39" dur="5.94">themselves that&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="829.36" dur="5.97">because I remember John Kerry out there</text>
  <text start="832.33" dur="7.98">says the people of Ukraine have every</text>
  <text start="835.33" dur="8.43">right to defend themselves they use that</text>
  <text start="840.31" dur="7.11">all the time and now North Korea is</text>
  <text start="843.76" dur="6.24">using it against the elite saying we</text>
  <text start="847.42" dur="6.51">have every right to defend ourselves</text>
  <text start="850" dur="6.569">because if you noticed John Kerry the</text>

  <text start="856.569" dur="5.671">that phrase a lot during his term well</text>
  <text start="860.649" dur="4.531">we have every right to defend ourselves</text>
  <text start="862.24" dur="6.51">and now we can see that other countries</text>
  <text start="865.18" dur="7.29">are doing the same exact thing we see</text>
  <text start="868.75" dur="7.29">that Trump is out there and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="872.47" dur="5.4">to Russia you must return Crimea now</text>
  <text start="876.04" dur="5.07">during a call with the Kremlin with</text>
  <text start="877.87" dur="8.12">Putin Trump never mentioned or raise the</text>
  <text start="881.11" dur="7.32">issue of Crimea at all not a word and</text>
  <text start="885.99" dur="4.719">this is very interesting first of all</text>
  <text start="888.43" dur="4.199">Russia saying that listen Crimea voted</text>
  <text start="890.709" dur="2.911">themselves away 97% of the people said</text>

  <text start="903.819" dur="6.031">d&amp;#39;etat and Crimea was part of Russia and</text>
  <text start="907.87" dur="2.73">we can see that Russia didn&amp;#39;t steal</text>
  <text start="909.85" dur="2.969">anything</text>
  <text start="910.6" dur="4.589">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="912.819" dur="4.291">bankers went into Ukraine and they push</text>
  <text start="915.189" dur="4.411">an agenda because they thought they were</text>
  <text start="917.11" dur="5.219">gonna capture Ukraine capture the</text>

  <text start="922.329" dur="4.5">on the Black Sea control the pipelines</text>
  <text start="924.49" dur="3.93">to Europe they thought all this was</text>
  <text start="926.829" dur="5.221">going to happen and remember right after</text>
  <text start="928.42" dur="6.599">coup d&amp;#39;etat the Biden and Kerry</text>
  <text start="932.05" dur="4.32">well they Biden brought in his son to be</text>

  <text start="940" dur="4.589">roommate put onto the board of directors</text>
  <text start="941.92" dur="6.18">and you can see this was all planned</text>
  <text start="944.589" dur="7.951">from the beginning now Russia&amp;#39;s spy ship</text>
  <text start="948.1" dur="8.989">it is about 30 miles away from the East</text>
  <text start="952.54" dur="7.38">Coast still in international waters and</text>
  <text start="957.089" dur="6.401">we can see right now that it&amp;#39;s sailing</text>
  <text start="959.92" dur="5.219">up and down the East Coast now we see</text>
  <text start="963.49" dur="3.959">that the corporate media is making a</text>
  <text start="965.139" dur="4.831">very big deal about this but you have to</text>
  <text start="967.449" dur="5.041">remember the United States government</text>
  <text start="969.97" dur="7.4">central bankers have warships that are</text>
  <text start="972.49" dur="8.819">sailing in the Black Sea close to Russia</text>
  <text start="977.37" dur="6.51">they have tanks military personnel</text>
  <text start="981.309" dur="7.221">pushed up to the line</text>
  <text start="983.88" dur="8.28">Russian border here we have one ship off</text>
  <text start="988.53" dur="7.71">the coast and the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="992.16" dur="7.19">making the biggest deal that you&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="996.24" dur="6.57">seen now all of this is to push the idea</text>
  <text start="999.35" dur="6.73">that Russia is coming to get us</text>
  <text start="1002.81" dur="5.52">because you can already see out in the</text>
  <text start="1006.08" dur="5.97">corporate media that there was another</text>
  <text start="1008.33" dur="5.91">unsafe flyby in the Black Sea now Russia</text>
  <text start="1012.05" dur="6.12">has denied the claims saying that this</text>
  <text start="1014.24" dur="6.51">has never happened and the US Defense</text>
  <text start="1018.17" dur="5.07">Department claimed that several Russian</text>
  <text start="1020.75" dur="7.199">jets buzzed a u.s. Navy ship three times</text>
  <text start="1023.24" dur="7.44">on February 10th and according to the</text>
  <text start="1027.949" dur="5.25">Russians they&amp;#39;re saying nope the flight</text>
  <text start="1030.68" dur="3.93">was conducted and being conducted over</text>
  <text start="1033.199" dur="3.421">neutral waters of the Black Sea in</text>
  <text start="1034.61" dur="4.89">accordance with international rules and</text>
  <text start="1036.62" dur="8.55">safety requirements and we see right now</text>
  <text start="1039.5" dur="9.54">all of this is to push the idea that</text>
  <text start="1045.17" dur="5.58">Russian is being very aggressive we can</text>
  <text start="1049.04" dur="5.4">see they&amp;#39;re back on this whole thing</text>
  <text start="1050.75" dur="4.77">ever since the propaganda came out</text>
  <text start="1054.44" dur="4.38">against Flynn</text>
  <text start="1055.52" dur="5.01">ever since the cyber attack during the</text>
  <text start="1058.82" dur="4.95">elections which never happened and we</text>
  <text start="1060.53" dur="7.17">can see all of this is fake up to this</text>
  <text start="1063.77" dur="5.94">point now the u.s. is saying that Russia</text>
  <text start="1067.7" dur="4.95">deployed new missiles in a treaty</text>
  <text start="1069.71" dur="7.16">violation now listen to the headline</text>
  <text start="1072.65" dur="7.41">that Reuters put out u.s. believes</text>
  <text start="1076.87" dur="6.58">Russia deployed new missile in treaty</text>
  <text start="1080.06" dur="7.41">violation they have no facts this is</text>
  <text start="1083.45" dur="8.07">again propaganda and of course Russia is</text>
  <text start="1087.47" dur="9.3">saying this is absolutely ridiculous</text>
  <text start="1091.52" dur="8.22">that they have not violated the 1987 INF</text>
  <text start="1096.77" dur="5.84">treaty and that stands for</text>
  <text start="1099.74" dur="6.02">intermediate-range nuclear forces and</text>
  <text start="1102.61" dur="7.96">they&amp;#39;re saying these allegations are</text>
  <text start="1105.76" dur="8.47">untrue and where did you get this from</text>
  <text start="1110.57" dur="5.73">so when we look a little bit closer we</text>
  <text start="1114.23" dur="3.51">see the allocations were supported by</text>
  <text start="1116.3" dur="8.94">the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="1117.74" dur="10.59">and US Senator John McCain called on the</text>
  <text start="1125.24" dur="6.319">Trump administration to respond to the</text>
  <text start="1128.33" dur="8.849">reported violations so who do you think</text>
  <text start="1131.559" dur="9.881">set all of this up most likely it had to</text>
  <text start="1137.179" dur="7.141">do with McCain because we can see what</text>
  <text start="1141.44" dur="6.119">he&amp;#39;s doing out in Ukraine this is the</text>
  <text start="1144.32" dur="6.45">year of the offensive here he is trying</text>
  <text start="1147.559" dur="5.911">to push Trump into a decision of what</text>
  <text start="1150.77" dur="4.379">they should do with Russia right now and</text>
  <text start="1153.47" dur="5.67">this is what is happening</text>
  <text start="1155.149" dur="7.471">they don&amp;#39;t want Trump making nice-nice</text>
  <text start="1159.14" dur="7.98">with Putin they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="1162.62" dur="6.57">him that Russia is a threat and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1167.12" dur="5.669">gonna see this continue on throughout</text>
  <text start="1169.19" dur="8.04">this year because their agenda is to</text>
  <text start="1172.789" dur="6.36">bring on a war they want a war we know</text>
  <text start="1177.23" dur="4.23">what&amp;#39;s coming the collapse of the system</text>
  <text start="1179.149" dur="4.471">and like I said we already got the</text>
  <text start="1181.46" dur="4.86">signal from Yellin don&amp;#39;t blame the Fed</text>
  <text start="1183.62" dur="4.11">so they want a blame on Trump they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1186.32" dur="3.78">going to need more than that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1187.73" dur="5.64">going to need a war for distraction and</text>
  <text start="1190.1" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to push this we see</text>
  <text start="1193.37" dur="4.169">out in Syria the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="1196.01" dur="3.84">carrying out several drone strikes</text>
  <text start="1197.539" dur="4.5">against the Syrian Arab army right now</text>
  <text start="1199.85" dur="3.72">and it looks like they&amp;#39;re using drones</text>
  <text start="1202.039" dur="6.931">now the other thing that they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1203.57" dur="7.109">is that in Iraq the Iraqi forces noticed</text>
  <text start="1208.97" dur="4.47">that the Islamic state they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="1210.679" dur="4.711">tanks now when they&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="1213.44" dur="5.04">tanks these aren&amp;#39;t tanks that they</text>
  <text start="1215.39" dur="6.45">captured they&amp;#39;re being supplied tanks</text>
  <text start="1218.48" dur="6.09">right now which shows us that supplies</text>
  <text start="1221.84" dur="7.439">are filtering in to the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1224.57" dur="7.109">and if you notice there&amp;#39;s a big Islamic</text>
  <text start="1229.279" dur="5.101">state buildup in Afghanistan because the</text>
  <text start="1231.679" dur="4.921">Taliban is taking control of Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="1234.38" dur="4.11">remember wherever the United States</text>
  <text start="1236.6" dur="5.37">government central bankers wherever they</text>
  <text start="1238.49" dur="5.61">need to take control or take reap or we</text>
  <text start="1241.97" dur="3.66">control the area they&amp;#39;re going to push</text>
  <text start="1244.1" dur="4.11">the Islamic state into that area just</text>
  <text start="1245.63" dur="4.529">like when the all the talks were falling</text>
  <text start="1248.21" dur="3">apart in Libya they had the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1250.159" dur="3.571">state move into that</text>
  <text start="1251.21" dur="3.87">area which gives the excuse of the</text>
  <text start="1253.73" dur="3.329">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="1255.08" dur="5.28">it gives them an excuse of going into</text>
  <text start="1257.059" dur="7.23">that country and bombing and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1260.36" dur="6.949">getting word from Russia that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1264.289" dur="6.931">is not coordinating strikes in Palmyra</text>
  <text start="1267.309" dur="5.831">they&amp;#39;re not going after the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1271.22" dur="7.319">state together the United States is</text>
  <text start="1273.14" dur="7.86">bombing on their own which means they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1278.539" dur="3.75">helping the Islamic state and during</text>
  <text start="1281" dur="3.27">this period we&amp;#39;re seeing the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1282.289" dur="4.471">state they&amp;#39;re gaining territory for some</text>
  <text start="1284.27" dur="3.93">reason which is quite odd actually it</text>
  <text start="1286.76" dur="6.87">really isn&amp;#39;t on because we saw this back</text>
  <text start="1288.2" dur="7.859">in 2013-2014 going into 2015 where when</text>
  <text start="1293.63" dur="4.679">the Islamic state came out and the</text>
  <text start="1296.059" dur="4.261">United States started to bomb we saw the</text>
  <text start="1298.309" dur="4.021">Islamic state increase their territory</text>
  <text start="1300.32" dur="6.209">over this period of time now we</text>
  <text start="1302.33" dur="5.79">understand that Russia the Syrian forces</text>
  <text start="1306.529" dur="3.361">they&amp;#39;ve been pushing back the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1308.12" dur="5.07">state they&amp;#39;ve been taking more and more</text>
  <text start="1309.89" dur="5.82">territory away from them we understand</text>
  <text start="1313.19" dur="4.92">that the deep state the elite the</text>
  <text start="1315.71" dur="6.39">central bankers they&amp;#39;re pushing the war</text>
  <text start="1318.11" dur="6.02">with Russia and they haven&amp;#39;t forgotten</text>
  <text start="1322.1" dur="4.17">about their goal to get rid of Assad</text>
  <text start="1324.13" dur="3.779">something very interesting just came up</text>
  <text start="1326.27" dur="4.56">where the Defense Department is</text>
  <text start="1327.909" dur="6.01">considering proposing sending</text>
  <text start="1330.83" dur="5.339">conventional ground combat forces into</text>
  <text start="1333.919" dur="4.561">northern Syria for the first time as</text>
  <text start="1336.169" dur="6.36">part of an effort to speed up the fight</text>
  <text start="1338.48" dur="7.199">against the Islamic state well we know</text>
  <text start="1342.529" dur="7.231">this is not what this is about we know</text>
  <text start="1345.679" dur="6.99">that this is to trap Trump into a war</text>
  <text start="1349.76" dur="5.07">with Russia they&amp;#39;re telling him it&amp;#39;s for</text>
  <text start="1352.669" dur="4.38">the Islamic state but they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="1354.83" dur="6.719">sending conventional ground troops into</text>
  <text start="1357.049" dur="8.551">Syria to help out the moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="1361.549" dur="4.73">and to remove Assad and we can see right</text>
  <text start="1365.6" dur="4.5">now</text>
  <text start="1366.279" dur="7.561">that this is being pushed and this might</text>
  <text start="1370.1" dur="6.03">lead to the kickoff of world war 3 and</text>
  <text start="1373.84" dur="5.23">this is something that we need to look</text>
  <text start="1376.13" dur="6.21">at because we can see right now Syria</text>
  <text start="1379.07" dur="4.829">has not invited the United States in</text>
  <text start="1382.34" dur="2.64">they said they will allow the United</text>
  <text start="1383.899" dur="3.691">States and if</text>
  <text start="1384.98" dur="4.59">they coordinate with Syria and Russia so</text>
  <text start="1387.59" dur="5.31">far the United States has not courting</text>
  <text start="1389.57" dur="6.21">now Trump needs to take that next step</text>
