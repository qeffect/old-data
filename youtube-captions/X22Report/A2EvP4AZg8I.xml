  <text start="704.12" dur="3.75">was going to be held today and we can</text>
  <text start="706.91" dur="2.669">see right now that they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="707.87" dur="6.659">talking about maybe negative interest</text>
  <text start="709.579" dur="6.781">rates maybe qe4 or anything else because</text>
  <text start="714.529" dur="3.571">they realize that this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="716.36" dur="4.4">starting to fall apart now Obama and</text>
  <text start="718.1" dur="5.01">Biden are going to attend this meeting</text>
  <text start="720.76" dur="4.81">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="723.11" dur="5.63">the entire economy starting to fall</text>
  <text start="725.57" dur="6.03">apart now you don&amp;#39;t have a meeting if</text>
  <text start="728.74" dur="4.93">everything is fine in the economy you</text>
  <text start="731.6" dur="4.2">don&amp;#39;t call an emergency meeting like</text>

  <text start="735.8" dur="6.599">economy if there are troubles worldwide</text>
  <text start="739.279" dur="8.31">and it&amp;#39;s eventually going to hit America</text>
  <text start="742.399" dur="8.071">or also Canada also Australia UK and</text>
  <text start="747.589" dur="6.481">everywhere else you have a meeting to</text>
  <text start="750.47" dur="5.79">discuss what&amp;#39;s going on and you discuss</text>
  <text start="754.07" dur="5.459">ways of trying to prop the system up</text>
  <text start="756.26" dur="6.449">even further so it doesn&amp;#39;t hit just yet</text>
  <text start="759.529" dur="4.771">because remember they don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="762.709" dur="3.511">blamed for this so what the things are</text>
  <text start="764.3" dur="3.899">going to be discussing well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="766.22" dur="4.559">going to be discussing what is going on</text>
  <text start="768.199" dur="5.51">in the world because Manufacturing&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="770.779" dur="7.471">down retails down unemployment</text>
  <text start="773.709" dur="5.861">skyrocketing debt is skyrocketing a lot</text>
  <text start="778.25" dur="3.72">of the private west and central bank</text>
  <text start="779.57" dur="7.709">countries are negative interest rates</text>
  <text start="781.97" dur="9.929">and here the illusion in the United</text>
  <text start="787.279" dur="6.18">States is rapidly deteriorating it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="791.899" dur="4.261">disintegrating right in front of our</text>
  <text start="793.459" dur="5.011">eyes as more and more indicators are</text>
  <text start="796.16" dur="4.14">being put in front of us we see that</text>
  <text start="798.47" dur="4.26">things are rapidly falling apart and</text>
  <text start="800.3" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening right now things</text>
  <text start="802.73" dur="3.81">are rapidly falling apart and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="804.86" dur="3.9">trying to figure out a way how to keep</text>
  <text start="806.54" dur="4.049">the system propped up yes can they</text>
  <text start="808.76" dur="3.449">continually manipulate the statistical</text>
  <text start="810.589" dur="3.391">information but after a while people</text>
  <text start="812.209" dur="4.261">look at this and say okay this ability</text>
  <text start="813.98" dur="4.65">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense anymore stock markets</text>
  <text start="816.47" dur="5.25">going up corporations are laying off</text>
  <text start="818.63" dur="4.889">left and right profits aren&amp;#39;t there that</text>
  <text start="821.72" dur="3.979">means more retail investors are going to</text>
  <text start="823.519" dur="4.141">leave the market and try to escape</text>
  <text start="825.699" dur="3.68">precious metals are going to continually</text>
  <text start="827.66" dur="3.459">go up because more and more</text>
  <text start="829.379" dur="4.05">of the paper currency is going to be</text>
  <text start="831.119" dur="4.77">pouring into physical gold they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="833.429" dur="4.02">to lose control of that and after a</text>
  <text start="835.889" dur="4.47">while the unemployment numbers don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="837.449" dur="4.35">make sense everything starts to make no</text>
  <text start="840.359" dur="3.54">sense whatsoever and this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="841.799" dur="3.24">happening right now and this is what</text>
  <text start="843.899" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re worried about because if they</text>
  <text start="845.039" dur="3.51">don&amp;#39;t do something very quickly here the</text>
  <text start="847.379" dur="3.18">whole thing is just going to come to a</text>
  <text start="848.549" dur="4.08">screeching halt and we will blame them</text>
  <text start="850.559" dur="4.35">and this is why I&amp;#39;ve been saying</text>
  <text start="852.629" dur="4.79">everyone needs to be prepared we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="854.909" dur="6.54">heading into a period and actually this</text>
  <text start="857.419" dur="7.15">really looks very close to 2008 remember</text>
  <text start="861.449" dur="5.43">when Obama and McCain were running for</text>
  <text start="864.569" dur="5.19">election and they were telling us that</text>
  <text start="866.879" dur="4.62">the economy is absolutely fine of course</text>
  <text start="869.759" dur="3.18">the head of the Fed at the time was</text>
  <text start="871.499" dur="4.17">telling us that everything&amp;#39;s contained</text>
  <text start="872.939" dur="5.97">on forecasting recession McCain was out</text>
  <text start="875.669" dur="7.29">there saying the economy strong and then</text>
  <text start="878.909" dur="6.99">all of a sudden during this whole period</text>
  <text start="882.959" dur="6.38">in October everything started to fall</text>
  <text start="885.899" dur="6.66">apart rapidly but prior to this</text>
  <text start="889.339" dur="7">everything was fine here we aren&amp;#39;t in</text>
  <text start="892.559" dur="7.2">April already and things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="896.339" dur="5.761">falling apart of course someone sitting</text>
  <text start="899.759" dur="4.17">on the outside not following what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="902.1" dur="3.959">really been going on they&amp;#39;re thinking</text>
  <text start="903.929" dur="4.41">that things are so fine I hear people</text>
  <text start="906.059" dur="3.69">all where I live talking about how the</text>
  <text start="908.339" dur="3.15">real estate markets going to continually</text>
  <text start="909.749" dur="3.87">rise it&amp;#39;s going to go to all new highs</text>
  <text start="911.489" dur="4.981">and of course I&amp;#39;m sitting there going oh</text>
  <text start="913.619" dur="6.12">I heard this before back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="916.47" dur="5.009">eight and everything just fell apart and</text>
  <text start="919.739" dur="5.04">we&amp;#39;re hearing the same talk once again</text>
  <text start="921.479" dur="6.121">and that tells me that things are</text>
  <text start="924.779" dur="5.79">rapidly falling apart and we can see</text>
  <text start="927.6" dur="5.459">right now that things are we&amp;#39;ve been</text>

  <text start="958.919" dur="4.73">time where everything falls apart people</text>
  <text start="962.039" dur="3.84">run to the market</text>
