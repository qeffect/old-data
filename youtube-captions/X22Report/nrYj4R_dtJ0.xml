  <text start="56.85" dur="5.04">rapport my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.23" dur="6.63">episode 1666 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.89" dur="5.61">September 17th 2018 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="64.86" dur="4.7">the episode is the central bankers have</text>
  <text start="67.5" dur="4.35">already picked a date for the crash</text>
  <text start="69.56" dur="5.56">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="71.85" dur="6.33">financial news now we&amp;#39;ve been watching</text>
  <text start="75.12" dur="7.35">the economy for quite a while we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="78.18" dur="7.74">this point where the economy is really</text>
  <text start="82.47" dur="6.36">ripping itself apart you can&amp;#39;t tell if</text>
  <text start="85.92" dur="4.5">you&amp;#39;re listening to the statistics that</text>
  <text start="88.83" dur="5.039">are coming out with which is</text>
  <text start="90.42" dur="6.15">unemployment GDP stock market actually</text>
  <text start="93.869" dur="4.86">if you go back prior to 2008 when the</text>
  <text start="96.57" dur="4.68">stock market came down you really</text>
  <text start="98.729" dur="5.011">couldn&amp;#39;t tell that there were any types</text>
  <text start="101.25" dur="4.56">of problems I mean everyone thought the</text>
  <text start="103.74" dur="2.61">economy was going to continue on the way</text>
  <text start="105.81" dur="3.12">it was</text>
  <text start="106.35" dur="5.1">no one knew there were problems with</text>
  <text start="108.93" dur="6.15">certain corporations certain financial</text>
  <text start="111.45" dur="6.3">institutions insurance companies and all</text>
  <text start="115.08" dur="6.02">of a sudden the market came down out of</text>
  <text start="117.75" dur="6.869">nowhere everyone thought the economy was</text>
  <text start="121.1" dur="4.87">fantastic there were a certain few that</text>
  <text start="124.619" dur="3.691">were looking into it and saying this is</text>
  <text start="125.97" dur="4.98">a ticking time bomb they just couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="128.31" dur="3.96">put the exact date and time on it but</text>
  <text start="130.95" dur="4.35">they knew eventually this was going to</text>
  <text start="132.27" dur="5.46">happen but we need to remember that this</text>
  <text start="135.3" dur="4.86">system that were in it&amp;#39;s a central</text>
  <text start="137.73" dur="6.15">banking system it&amp;#39;s not designed to last</text>
  <text start="140.16" dur="7.409">forever it&amp;#39;s designed to keep everyone</text>
  <text start="143.88" dur="6.96">in debt and it&amp;#39;s designed to crash and</text>
  <text start="147.569" dur="6.571">then pump it up and then crash it until</text>
  <text start="150.84" dur="5.4">the system can&amp;#39;t go on any further this</text>
  <text start="154.14" dur="6.21">is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now we are at</text>
  <text start="156.24" dur="7.26">the end stage of this system and they</text>
  <text start="160.35" dur="5.7">know that the system is going to crash</text>
  <text start="163.5" dur="5.819">they know they can&amp;#39;t keep this going</text>
  <text start="166.05" dur="4.74">much further and we talked about how</text>
  <text start="169.319" dur="3.361">there&amp;#39;s two sides to this narrative</text>
  <text start="170.79" dur="6">let&amp;#39;s look at what has been happening</text>
  <text start="172.68" dur="6.63">here Trump using the deep state the</text>
  <text start="176.79" dur="6.69">central bank methods has pumped the</text>
  <text start="179.31" dur="7.02">statistical numbers up to an area that</text>
  <text start="183.48" dur="3.75">we&amp;#39;ve never seen before GDP the highest</text>
  <text start="186.33" dur="2.79">ever</text>
  <text start="187.23" dur="3.99">and I&amp;#39;m not saying the history of the</text>
  <text start="189.12" dur="4.619">entire economy I&amp;#39;m talking about since</text>
  <text start="191.22" dur="5.519">the recovery I mean really he&amp;#39;s doubled</text>
  <text start="193.739" dur="5.28">the GDP numbers just by manipulating the</text>
  <text start="196.739" dur="4.351">numbers and moving it just a little bit</text>
  <text start="199.019" dur="4.651">to make the GDP numbers look a lot</text>
  <text start="201.09" dur="6.06">better unemployment down to three point</text>
  <text start="203.67" dur="6.14">nine percent from all intents purposes</text>
  <text start="207.15" dur="5.309">it looks like the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="209.81" dur="6.16">fantastically it&amp;#39;s chugging along</text>
  <text start="212.459" dur="5.791">in reality it&amp;#39;s falling apart nothing&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="215.97" dur="5.099">changed people are still out of the</text>
  <text start="218.25" dur="4.59">workforce people didn&amp;#39;t get these jobs</text>
  <text start="221.069" dur="3.991">back there&amp;#39;s hundreds of millions of</text>
  <text start="222.84" dur="3.33">people out of the workforce there are a</text>
  <text start="225.06" dur="3.269">lot of people that are holding down one</text>
  <text start="226.17" dur="4.649">to three part-time jobs because they</text>
  <text start="228.329" dur="4.201">lost their full-time job corporations</text>
  <text start="230.819" dur="4.471">financial institutions they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="232.53" dur="5.039">buying back their stocks in stock market</text>
  <text start="235.29" dur="4.43">is still manipulated these statistical</text>
  <text start="237.569" dur="6">numbers they are still manipulated and</text>
  <text start="239.72" dur="5.859">the housing market has been pumped up</text>
  <text start="243.569" dur="4.351">into this gigantic bubble at the same</text>
  <text start="245.579" dur="5.791">time the retail industry has been</text>
  <text start="247.92" dur="5.55">falling apart so if you really look back</text>
  <text start="251.37" dur="6.26">in the time that we&amp;#39;re reporting with</text>
  <text start="253.47" dur="6.84">Obama to now not much has changed</text>
  <text start="257.63" dur="6.97">because this is a central bank economy</text>
  <text start="260.31" dur="7.859">it&amp;#39;s not going to change yes we need to</text>
  <text start="264.6" dur="5.58">bring manufacturing that back here yes</text>
  <text start="268.169" dur="4.981">we need to get rid of the globalist</text>
  <text start="270.18" dur="4.35">deals yes we need to rework certain</text>
  <text start="273.15" dur="5.01">things that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening in the</text>
  <text start="274.53" dur="6.54">background right now in the meantime it</text>
  <text start="278.16" dur="4.89">looks like Trump has repaired the</text>
  <text start="281.07" dur="4.14">economy and made it a lot better this is</text>
  <text start="283.05" dur="6.92">done on purpose this is part of the</text>
  <text start="285.21" dur="8.04">strategy so this way nobody can blame</text>
  <text start="289.97" dur="5.379">Trump remember before Trump came into</text>
  <text start="293.25" dur="3.51">office he said sock markets a bubble</text>
  <text start="295.349" dur="3.621">housings a bubble all the stuff is a</text>
  <text start="296.76" dur="4.35">bubble it&amp;#39;s manipulated he knew it and</text>
  <text start="298.97" dur="4.18">he knew what they were going to do when</text>
  <text start="301.11" dur="4.2">he got into office not just him there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="303.15" dur="6.329">many people behind him and he knew the</text>
  <text start="305.31" dur="7.859">only way around this is to take what</text>
  <text start="309.479" dur="6.541">they&amp;#39;ve done in the past and accelerate</text>
  <text start="313.169" dur="6.361">it to the extreme and this is what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="316.02" dur="5.07">done this way what are they gonna say he</text>
  <text start="319.53" dur="4.73">destroyed the economy when he</text>
  <text start="321.09" dur="5.1">GDP up from 2.1 all the way up to 4.2</text>
  <text start="324.26" dur="4.42">brought the unemployment all the way</text>
  <text start="326.19" dur="4.41">down to 3.9 even obama has been trying</text>
  <text start="328.68" dur="5.19">to get on this saying that this is his</text>
  <text start="330.6" dur="4.58">economy well when it falls apart and</text>
  <text start="333.87" dur="4.17">crashes he can have it</text>
  <text start="335.18" dur="5.65">remember this is a central bank economy</text>
  <text start="338.04" dur="4.59">and the whole push is to get out of this</text>
  <text start="340.83" dur="4.11">economy and there&amp;#39;s going to be two</text>
  <text start="342.63" dur="4.62">narratives one where you have a deep</text>
  <text start="344.94" dur="4.05">state the central banks where they want</text>
  <text start="347.25" dur="2.91">their system to continue on</text>
  <text start="348.99" dur="2.82">remember they thought they were gonna</text>
  <text start="350.16" dur="3.27">have someone else in office they thought</text>
  <text start="351.81" dur="3.78">they were going to have a war this is</text>
  <text start="353.43" dur="4.32">not happening they thought would trump</text>
  <text start="355.59" dur="4.86">implementing all these tariffs and</text>
  <text start="357.75" dur="4.77">whatnot in tax relief and things like</text>
  <text start="360.45" dur="5.55">that the this would be the perfect</text>
  <text start="362.52" dur="6.09">excuse to say everything that he&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="366" dur="4.5">has brought the economy down but he kind</text>
  <text start="368.61" dur="4.02">of tricked them by pumping the</text>
  <text start="370.5" dur="3.96">statistical number these statistical</text>
  <text start="372.63" dur="4.44">numbers up they can&amp;#39;t really come out</text>
  <text start="374.46" dur="4.38">and say hey you brought the economy down</text>
  <text start="377.07" dur="3.96">from the terrace because when you look</text>
  <text start="378.84" dur="3.69">at what&amp;#39;s going on here it looks</text>
  <text start="381.03" dur="4.11">fantastic and they&amp;#39;re not gonna call him</text>
  <text start="382.53" dur="4.71">out on manipulation because he would</text>
  <text start="385.14" dur="5.13">just point to Obama I&amp;#39;m using the same</text>
  <text start="387.24" dur="5.429">calculations so they&amp;#39;re not going to do</text>
  <text start="390.27" dur="4.47">that so he kind of has them right now</text>
  <text start="392.669" dur="5.671">now it&amp;#39;s very interesting we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="394.74" dur="6.72">hearing a lot about this date of when</text>
  <text start="398.34" dur="6.079">they think the economy&amp;#39;s gonna collapse</text>
  <text start="401.46" dur="7.95">and what we&amp;#39;re getting from JP Morgan</text>
  <text start="404.419" dur="9.691">from other bankers from the central bank</text>
  <text start="409.41" dur="8.24">system they&amp;#39;re now reporting that the</text>
  <text start="414.11" dur="8.619">global financial system will crash</text>
  <text start="417.65" dur="6.85">around 2020 now it&amp;#39;s not because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="422.729" dur="3.961">going to crash it I don&amp;#39;t think at this</text>
  <text start="424.5" dur="6.87">point I think what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="426.69" dur="8.31">here is the system finally crashes on</text>
  <text start="431.37" dur="6.39">its own this is the furthest point where</text>
  <text start="435" dur="5.88">they were going to have the system go to</text>
  <text start="437.76" dur="4.86">and then it completely breaks down think</text>
  <text start="440.88" dur="4.56">about what all the central banks are</text>
  <text start="442.62" dur="5.43">doing right now a lot of them are</text>
  <text start="445.44" dur="4.71">looking to raise interest rates some of</text>
  <text start="448.05" dur="4.38">them are looking to unwind some central</text>
  <text start="450.15" dur="4.199">banks are not the Fed is definitely</text>
  <text start="452.43" dur="2.16">doing this and I think what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="454.349" dur="2.371">here</text>
  <text start="454.59" dur="3.329">is that Trump and Powell they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="456.72" dur="5.1">cahoots with each other</text>
  <text start="457.919" dur="7.351">they are working the system to bring it</text>
  <text start="461.82" dur="5.79">down and this system remember was not</text>
  <text start="465.27" dur="3.66">designed to go much longer they thought</text>
  <text start="467.61" dur="4.89">they were going to explain this all away</text>
  <text start="468.93" dur="5.55">with an event but it didn&amp;#39;t happen so</text>
  <text start="472.5" dur="5.07">now what we&amp;#39;re getting is that this</text>
  <text start="474.48" dur="4.83">system is going to die in 2020 what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="477.57" dur="3.75">the exact date we don&amp;#39;t know they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="479.31" dur="3.87">going to say they just projected that</text>
  <text start="481.32" dur="4.319">this is when the system will not be able</text>
  <text start="483.18" dur="4.56">to function do I think this is going to</text>
  <text start="485.639" dur="3.84">come down a lot sooner than this yes</text>
  <text start="487.74" dur="2.13">because think about what Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="489.479" dur="4.741">right now</text>
  <text start="489.87" dur="6.6">he&amp;#39;s been pumping up the data and this</text>
  <text start="494.22" dur="5.36">way if there&amp;#39;s bad news or the Fed is</text>
  <text start="496.47" dur="6.63">raising rates they can just say hey I</text>
  <text start="499.58" dur="6.67">made this economy great the corruption</text>
  <text start="503.1" dur="5.22">the Fed brought it down oh it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="506.25" dur="5.789">interesting about all of this is what</text>
  <text start="508.32" dur="6.33">they&amp;#39;re saying is going to happen now an</text>
  <text start="512.039" dur="4.951">analyst at investment bank JP Morgan say</text>
  <text start="514.65" dur="6.569">the recession is going to happen in two</text>
  <text start="516.99" dur="6.179">years or maybe a little bit sooner don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="521.219" dur="3.511">know exactly but they know the system</text>
  <text start="523.169" dur="4.531">will only last for a certain period of</text>
  <text start="524.73" dur="6.3">time and they&amp;#39;re saying that during this</text>
  <text start="527.7" dur="7.95">time central banks will spiral into</text>
  <text start="531.03" dur="6.66">depression energy prices the value of</text>

  <text start="537.69" dur="6.12">markets such as Brazil Russia India and</text>

  <text start="593.28" dur="8.04">financial crisis as bad as the crash in</text>
  <text start="596.19" dur="7.77">2008 and we can see that they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="601.32" dur="6.36">worried about what is going to happen</text>
  <text start="603.96" dur="6.36">here because they know that their system</text>
  <text start="607.68" dur="5.69">will only last for a certain period of</text>
  <text start="610.32" dur="5.43">time and then it breaks down on its own</text>
  <text start="613.37" dur="5.14">this is what we this is what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="615.75" dur="5.76">experiencing all this time and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="618.51" dur="7.26">going to accelerate as time goes on the</text>
  <text start="621.51" dur="7.53">problem here is they don&amp;#39;t have any one</text>
  <text start="625.77" dur="6.45">or any country to blame this on or any</text>
  <text start="629.04" dur="8.31">type of an event like war they are stuck</text>
  <text start="632.22" dur="8.43">and it&amp;#39;s all being set up so they have</text>
  <text start="637.35" dur="6.09">no way out of this situation they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="640.65" dur="3.6">blame it on Trump the tariffs even</text>
  <text start="643.44" dur="2.67">though the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="644.25" dur="4.83">mainstream media is continually pushing</text>
  <text start="646.11" dur="5.13">that agenda where the tariffs are</text>
  <text start="649.08" dur="5.49">finally going to take effect we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="651.24" dur="6.18">see the economy fall remember Trump told</text>
  <text start="654.57" dur="4.5">Obama I have the magic wand right now to</text>
  <text start="657.42" dur="4.5">make the economy look any way he wants</text>
  <text start="659.07" dur="5.19">yes they are just numbers but he has the</text>
  <text start="661.92" dur="5.79">ability to do this this is part of the</text>
  <text start="664.26" dur="7.35">strategy because Trump the Patriots they</text>
  <text start="667.71" dur="8.28">know that news is going to come out and</text>
  <text start="671.61" dur="7.92">it&amp;#39;s going to rock not just the US but</text>
