  <text start="123.219" dur="5.701">video there let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="126.219" dur="5.791">collapse financial news now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="128.92" dur="4.71">interesting is that as we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="132.01" dur="2.729">the economy we&amp;#39;re following the economy</text>
  <text start="133.63" dur="4.979">we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on the economy</text>
  <text start="134.739" dur="7.891">we&amp;#39;ve been noticing that each economic</text>
  <text start="138.609" dur="6.511">sector is declining at its own pace and</text>
  <text start="142.63" dur="5.16">some sectors are a lot worse than others</text>
  <text start="145.12" dur="4.589">but what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that most</text>
  <text start="147.79" dur="5.419">of them I would say the majority of them</text>
  <text start="149.709" dur="6.181">they are declining now we know that the</text>
  <text start="153.209" dur="6.4">manufacturing industry the automobile</text>
  <text start="155.89" dur="6.27">industry has been pumped up we know how</text>
  <text start="159.609" dur="4.951">they&amp;#39;ve been doing it they realize what</text>
  <text start="162.16" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;ve been doing we know that to sell</text>
  <text start="164.56" dur="3.39">their automobiles they&amp;#39;re giving a huge</text>
  <text start="166.15" dur="4.05">amount of incentives they&amp;#39;re bringing in</text>
  <text start="167.95" dur="4.94">the sub-prime of subprime people just</text>
  <text start="170.2" dur="5.19">trying to push the cars off the lot and</text>
  <text start="172.89" dur="6.31">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all this</text>
  <text start="175.39" dur="8.249">Equifax chief economist Amy Cruz cuts</text>
  <text start="179.2" dur="6.31">well she pointed out that in 2016 and</text>
  <text start="183.639" dur="4.541">2017</text>
  <text start="185.51" dur="7.11">deels are mysteriously performing more</text>
  <text start="188.18" dur="8.07">like 2007 securitizations than those</text>
  <text start="192.62" dur="5.81">underwritten in 2010 and what you said</text>
  <text start="196.25" dur="4.769">is we&amp;#39;re seeing an increase in</text>
  <text start="198.43" dur="5.619">delinquencies across all credit scores</text>
  <text start="201.019" dur="7.591">but in the highest credit quality is</text>
  <text start="204.049" dur="7.321">just a basis point or two in deep</text>
  <text start="208.61" dur="5.58">subprime the rise is more substantial</text>
  <text start="211.37" dur="5.55">what stood out to me was the issuers</text>
  <text start="214.19" dur="3.99">those that have been doing this for a</text>
  <text start="216.92" dur="3.149">decade or more</text>
  <text start="218.18" dur="4.889">we&amp;#39;re showing the better performance</text>
  <text start="220.069" dur="6.841">while those that were relative newcomers</text>
  <text start="223.069" dur="6.591">were in the worst category and what</text>
  <text start="226.91" dur="6.54">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that these automobile</text>
  <text start="229.66" dur="6.699">deals these incentives they are pushing</text>
  <text start="233.45" dur="7.319">it towards the people with sub subprime</text>
  <text start="236.359" dur="8.16">so if we look at April 2017 pricing on</text>
  <text start="240.769" dur="6.511">new vehicles they include around $1500</text>
  <text start="244.519" dur="5.58">in finance rebates that have a certain</text>
  <text start="247.28" dur="4.98">credit requirement and you have to have</text>
  <text start="250.099" dur="4.67">a certain score to claim this rebate</text>
  <text start="252.26" dur="5.219">when looking at this and this is mostly</text>
  <text start="254.769" dur="5.71">American manufactured automobiles</text>
  <text start="257.479" dur="5.971">they&amp;#39;re saying that the finance office</text>
  <text start="260.479" dur="7.351">is credit score based and you must be</text>
  <text start="263.45" dur="7.649">below 620 to qualify if you are over 620</text>
  <text start="267.83" dur="5.04">you must add up to $1,500 to the price</text>
  <text start="271.099" dur="4.051">so what they&amp;#39;re saying is if you have a</text>
  <text start="272.87" dur="5.43">credit score under 620 they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="275.15" dur="6.48">take $1,500 off and if you&amp;#39;re above 620</text>
  <text start="278.3" dur="6.39">well you have to add $1,500 to the price</text>
  <text start="281.63" dur="5.099">and let me give this varies between make</text>
  <text start="284.69" dur="4.56">and model but what they&amp;#39;re doing right</text>
  <text start="286.729" dur="5.401">now is they&amp;#39;re bringing in subprime</text>
  <text start="289.25" dur="6.289">people and they&amp;#39;re trying to push the</text>
  <text start="292.13" dur="6.75">automobiles by giving them an incentive</text>
  <text start="295.539" dur="5.711">because they realize the people with the</text>
  <text start="298.88" dur="4.11">good credit well they&amp;#39;re running out of</text>
  <text start="301.25" dur="4.83">those people they need to bring those</text>
  <text start="302.99" dur="5.429">people in who might not have great</text>
  <text start="306.08" dur="5.88">credit or scores under 620 because</text>
  <text start="308.419" dur="5.631">they&amp;#39;re running out of people now think</text>
  <text start="311.96" dur="4.59">about this for a second this lender is</text>
  <text start="314.05" dur="4.869">actually trying to attract borrowers</text>
  <text start="316.55" dur="5.25">with lower credit scores</text>
  <text start="318.919" dur="8.49">than higher credit scores so they are</text>
  <text start="321.8" dur="8.729">trying to sell a $55,000 vehicle to</text>
  <text start="327.409" dur="6.331">those individuals in the sub subprime</text>
  <text start="330.529" dur="5.79">category which is unbelievable because</text>
  <text start="333.74" dur="5.13">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is basically what we</text>
  <text start="336.319" dur="8.25">saw back in the housing market before</text>
  <text start="338.87" dur="8.49">2008 now industrial production well this</text>
  <text start="344.569" dur="4.861">is continually dropping US manufacturing</text>
  <text start="347.36" dur="5.339">production is dropping right now now</text>
  <text start="349.43" dur="6">they expected manufacturing to rise by</text>
  <text start="352.699" dur="4.71">0.4% but it only came in at point two</text>
  <text start="355.43" dur="4.349">percent in July which completely missed</text>
  <text start="357.409" dur="4.98">expectations and manufacturing</text>
  <text start="359.779" dur="5.19">production actually shrank by negative</text>
  <text start="362.389" dur="6.09">0.1 percent now the biggest driver of</text>
  <text start="364.969" dur="7.831">the decline was a 3.6 percent slump in</text>
  <text start="368.479" dur="7.62">motor vehicle production and we can see</text>
  <text start="372.8" dur="4.859">right now the stock market even though</text>
  <text start="376.099" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s been down for the last couple of</text>
  <text start="377.659" dur="4.04">days is continually moving up while</text>
  <text start="379.819" dur="5.46">industrial production manufacturing is</text>
  <text start="381.699" dur="4.87">declining at the same time but it</text>
  <text start="385.279" dur="2.991">doesn&amp;#39;t really matter because we know</text>
  <text start="386.569" dur="4.41">the stock market is completely</text>
  <text start="388.27" dur="4.6">manipulated and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="390.979" dur="4.291">now is when we look at all these</text>
  <text start="392.87" dur="5.759">different economic sectors like retail</text>
  <text start="395.27" dur="6.869">for instance we see that this is having</text>
  <text start="398.629" dur="8.04">major problems a lot of stores closing a</text>
  <text start="402.139" dur="7.411">lot of people losing their jobs and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="406.669" dur="5.161">not going to online sales because</text>
  <text start="409.55" dur="4.56">remember most of these corporations they</text>
  <text start="411.83" dur="4.049">all have an online presence it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="414.11" dur="3.69">like oh we have a brick-and-mortar store</text>
  <text start="415.879" dur="4.141">and we don&amp;#39;t have an online presence</text>
  <text start="417.8" dur="3.929">actually the brick-and-mortar stores</text>
  <text start="420.02" dur="3.509">they have a little bit of an edge</text>
  <text start="421.729" dur="4.59">because you could order something online</text>
  <text start="423.529" dur="5.01">and actually drive over and pick it up</text>
  <text start="426.319" dur="4.62">the same day instead of waiting for the</text>
  <text start="428.539" dur="6.541">next day or two days to receive it in</text>
  <text start="430.939" dur="7.41">the mail so it&amp;#39;s not online sales what</text>
  <text start="435.08" dur="5.699">is happening is the people around the</text>
  <text start="438.349" dur="4.861">country who are losing their jobs who&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="440.779" dur="5.221">never recovered and those people who are</text>
  <text start="443.21" dur="4.459">just coming into the mix they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="446" dur="5.42">the funds because we know that wages</text>
  <text start="447.669" dur="7.531">salaries they are declining and this is</text>
  <text start="451.42" dur="6.45">genuine we&amp;#39;re going to see each economic</text>
  <text start="455.2" dur="4.14">sector continually decline as we move</text>
  <text start="457.87" dur="3.27">throughout this year there is no</text>
  <text start="459.34" dur="3.39">stopping it I know Trump is out there</text>
  <text start="461.14" dur="3.09">and he&amp;#39;s saying that all these jobs are</text>
  <text start="462.73" dur="4.53">coming back he created a million jobs</text>
  <text start="464.23" dur="4.2">again governments speak they like to</text>
  <text start="467.26" dur="3.33">tell you everything that they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="468.43" dur="4.11">but most of it is not true because we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="470.59" dur="3.39">been looking at the economic facts we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="472.54" dur="4.17">been looking at what has been happening</text>
  <text start="473.98" dur="4.77">and we can see that the United States is</text>
  <text start="476.71" dur="3.93">in a major decline actually the global</text>
  <text start="478.75" dur="3.93">economy is in a major decline but of</text>
  <text start="480.64" dur="4.32">course the illusion where the central</text>
  <text start="482.68" dur="3.75">bank is pushing free money and</text>
  <text start="484.96" dur="3.69">everything like that and stimulus it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="486.43" dur="4.77">making it look like everything is fine</text>
  <text start="488.65" dur="4.62">we&amp;#39;ve seen this before in different</text>
  <text start="491.2" dur="5.46">companies we&amp;#39;ve seen it before in Ponzi</text>
  <text start="493.27" dur="5.07">schemes and once again we have major</text>
  <text start="496.66" dur="4.23">problems headed our way</text>
  <text start="498.34" dur="4.86">for instance we have the debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="500.89" dur="3.9">problem that&amp;#39;s coming up are they going</text>
  <text start="503.2" dur="4.56">to raise the debt ceiling most likely</text>
  <text start="504.79" dur="4.32">yes is that going to improve anything no</text>
  <text start="507.76" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re just going to spend more money</text>
  <text start="509.11" dur="6.42">and what&amp;#39;s happening here is we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="512.23" dur="5.1">on this illusionary ride for a very long</text>
  <text start="515.53" dur="4.79">time or coming off the Obama economy</text>
  <text start="517.33" dur="6.03">where he told us that he&amp;#39;s handing this</text>
  <text start="520.32" dur="4.99">incredible economy off to Trump now</text>
  <text start="523.36" dur="3.87">Trump could have turned around and said</text>
  <text start="525.31" dur="4.47">listen this economy is a complete</text>
  <text start="527.23" dur="4.92">disaster it&amp;#39;s an illusion but I think</text>
  <text start="529.78" dur="4.38">there&amp;#39;d be panic panic in the streets I</text>
  <text start="532.15" dur="4.14">think the elite the corporate media</text>
  <text start="534.16" dur="4.31">would have been it&amp;#39;s all your fault</text>
  <text start="536.29" dur="4.56">you&amp;#39;re the one who did it Obama was</text>
  <text start="538.47" dur="4.42">giving you this healthy economy you</text>
  <text start="540.85" dur="4.88">destroyed it and I think right now Trump</text>
  <text start="542.89" dur="5.28">is going along with the ride where he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="545.73" dur="4.78">convincing everyone that yes this</text>
  <text start="548.17" dur="4.92">economy is doing well in the meantime</text>
  <text start="550.51" dur="4.35">and he&amp;#39;s not doing a very good job at</text>
  <text start="553.09" dur="4.47">this he&amp;#39;s trying to bring back</text>
  <text start="554.86" dur="5.49">manufacturing he&amp;#39;s trying to make deals</text>
  <text start="557.56" dur="4.98">to set this economy up for the</text>
  <text start="560.35" dur="4.32">transition but you can see that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="562.54" dur="4.35">major major problems because basically</text>
  <text start="564.67" dur="4.68">the corporate media the elite the deep</text>
  <text start="566.89" dur="4.53">state they want him removed I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="569.35" dur="5.04">completely obvious from what is going on</text>
  <text start="571.42" dur="5.52">here and what is happening is we are</text>
  <text start="574.39" dur="5.28">approaching certain deadlines coming up</text>
  <text start="576.94" dur="3.33">this fall with the budget with the debt</text>
  <text start="579.67" dur="3.03">ceiling</text>
  <text start="580.27" dur="4.619">with everything else Congress is going</text>
  <text start="582.7" dur="4.499">to be coming back in</text>
  <text start="584.889" dur="4.081">Labor Day and we&amp;#39;re going to see the</text>
  <text start="587.199" dur="3.66">fireworks we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot</text>
  <text start="588.97" dur="4.26">happening during that period of time and</text>
  <text start="590.859" dur="5.58">we can see that the corporate media they</text>
  <text start="593.23" dur="4.769">are primed and ready to blame everything</text>
  <text start="596.439" dur="4.291">on Trump and I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="597.999" dur="4.74">any problem whatsoever when things start</text>
  <text start="600.73" dur="3.899">to really fall apart and I think the</text>
  <text start="602.739" dur="4.35">central bank I think those who are in</text>
  <text start="604.629" dur="4.8">power they are prepared and ready to</text>
  <text start="607.089" dur="5.37">bring down the system and point the</text>
  <text start="609.429" dur="4.981">finger towards Trump and I think this is</text>
  <text start="612.459" dur="4.021">exactly what&amp;#39;s going to happen we can</text>
  <text start="614.41" dur="5.849">see that fingers are being pointed at</text>
  <text start="616.48" dur="6.99">them right now and the entire country</text>
  <text start="620.259" dur="4.98">right now is in complete chaos and the</text>
  <text start="623.47" dur="3.449">corporate media and everyone else is</text>
  <text start="625.239" dur="4.2">just keeping this up this is all</text>
  <text start="626.919" dur="5.52">building and this will feed right into</text>
  <text start="629.439" dur="4.56">the economy how what he&amp;#39;s trying to do</text>
  <text start="632.439" dur="3.15">with NAFTA and everything else is</text>
  <text start="633.999" dur="3.39">completely destroying the economy</text>
  <text start="635.589" dur="3.75">because we know that McCain and many</text>
  <text start="637.389" dur="4.17">others are out there saying hey do not</text>
  <text start="639.339" dur="4.83">touch NAFTA we don&amp;#39;t want that touched</text>
  <text start="641.559" dur="5.22">and we know this is the elite bread and</text>
  <text start="644.169" dur="4.53">butter this is why they want the the TPP</text>
  <text start="646.779" dur="3.72">this is why they were pushing for all</text>
  <text start="648.699" dur="4.95">these trade deals because it makes them</text>
  <text start="650.499" dur="5.101">a whole lot of money it doesn&amp;#39;t help the</text>
  <text start="653.649" dur="4.38">everyday person it doesn&amp;#39;t help trade</text>
  <text start="655.6" dur="4.469">with the United States because we can</text>
  <text start="658.029" dur="5.31">see it&amp;#39;s completely obvious that most of</text>
  <text start="660.069" dur="6.75">the jobs have been sent overseas so we</text>
  <text start="663.339" dur="5.73">are heading down this path and I think</text>
  <text start="666.819" dur="5.37">things are going to really accelerate as</text>
  <text start="669.069" dur="6.151">we enter the fall months and as we move</text>
  <text start="672.189" dur="5.64">into the fall the winter is just going</text>
  <text start="675.22" dur="4.469">to do going to deteriorate a lot more</text>
  <text start="677.829" dur="3.69">and it&amp;#39;s not going to improve whatsoever</text>
  <text start="679.689" dur="6.27">we&amp;#39;ve been watching this for quite a</text>
  <text start="681.519" dur="6.81">while and every holiday season every</text>
  <text start="685.959" dur="4.47">summer season we can see that real</text>
  <text start="688.329" dur="3.69">estate deteriorates a little bit more we</text>
  <text start="690.429" dur="3.541">can see that retail has been</text>
  <text start="692.019" dur="3.99">deteriorating quite a bit now I mean</text>
  <text start="693.97" dur="3.809">it&amp;#39;s really flashing red signals all</text>
  <text start="696.009" dur="3.721">over the place we can see the tax</text>
  <text start="697.779" dur="4.77">receipts coming into the government they</text>
  <text start="699.73" dur="4.68">are dropping every single day tax</text>
  <text start="702.549" dur="4.59">receipts coming into the state level</text>
  <text start="704.41" dur="5.759">they are dropping every day because what</text>
  <text start="707.139" dur="5.43">is happening here is as people lose</text>
  <text start="710.169" dur="5.97">their full-time job and as wages</text>
  <text start="712.569" dur="6.181">continually decline what happens people</text>
  <text start="716.139" dur="4.111">pay less taxes as people lose their job</text>
  <text start="718.75" dur="3.81">doesn&amp;#39;t get part-time jobs or can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="720.25" dur="4.59">a job less taxes coming to the</text>
  <text start="722.56" dur="4.71">government this is what we are seeing</text>
  <text start="724.84" dur="5.19">right now this is why under Obama</text>
  <text start="727.27" dur="5.73">they created fact Gatka because they</text>
  <text start="730.03" dur="5.19">were looking for more tax revenue this</text>
  <text start="733" dur="4.62">is why they went overseas and again</text>
  <text start="735.22" dur="3.54">there wasn&amp;#39;t that much out there they</text>
  <text start="737.62" dur="4.11">thought it was going to be a lot more</text>
  <text start="738.76" dur="4.95">and what is happening is the tax</text>
  <text start="741.73" dur="4.23">receipts are continually declining and</text>
  <text start="743.71" dur="4.2">as more and more people lose jobs in</text>
  <text start="745.96" dur="3.72">retail more people lose jobs in</text>
  <text start="747.91" dur="3.99">corporations because as we can see the</text>
  <text start="749.68" dur="4.17">revenues coming in to corporations they</text>
  <text start="751.9" dur="4.5">are not there the sales are not there</text>
  <text start="753.85" dur="4.74">earnings revenue completely different</text>
  <text start="756.4" dur="4.65">they can you know shut down plants lay</text>
  <text start="758.59" dur="4.32">off people buy back their stocks make</text>
  <text start="761.05" dur="4.26">their earnings look good but the sales</text>
  <text start="762.91" dur="4.11">on the revenue they can&amp;#39;t manipulate</text>
  <text start="765.31" dur="4.05">that part and that has been the problem</text>
  <text start="767.02" dur="5.46">all along just like the central banks</text>
  <text start="769.36" dur="4.71">cannot manipulate people into going out</text>
  <text start="772.48" dur="4.17">and spending their money it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="774.07" dur="3.96">completely impossible this is why</text>
  <text start="776.65" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re talking about helicopter money</text>
  <text start="778.03" dur="5.43">this is why they&amp;#39;re telling you hey why</text>
  <text start="780.64" dur="6.63">don&amp;#39;t you take a line of credit from</text>
  <text start="783.46" dur="6.21">your appreciation from your real estate</text>
  <text start="787.27" dur="5.1">holdings they&amp;#39;re trying to do everything</text>
  <text start="789.67" dur="4.5">possible to get you out there and spend</text>
  <text start="792.37" dur="3.21">the money that you really don&amp;#39;t have I</text>
  <text start="794.17" dur="3.66">mean if you take an equity line of</text>
  <text start="795.58" dur="5.009">credit you&amp;#39;re just borrowing money it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="797.83" dur="5.04">not really yours it&amp;#39;s on paper and if</text>
  <text start="800.589" dur="3.871">the real estate market comes down all</text>
  <text start="802.87" dur="3.24">those people who took an equity line of</text>
  <text start="804.46" dur="4.32">credit they&amp;#39;re screwed they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="806.11" dur="7.05">underwater but they don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="808.78" dur="6.54">that they want you to take out loans</text>
  <text start="813.16" dur="4.5">this is the way their system stays alive</text>
  <text start="815.32" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s why they always report on credit</text>
  <text start="817.66" dur="4.53">more people are spending money how do</text>
  <text start="820.54" dur="4.2">they know this because more people are</text>
  <text start="822.19" dur="3.78">using their credit cards that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="824.74" dur="4.02">mean people are spending their own money</text>
  <text start="825.97" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re borrowing money to keep the</text>
  <text start="828.76" dur="4.59">system alive they&amp;#39;re not looking at how</text>
  <text start="831.22" dur="3.48">much money people actually have and how</text>
  <text start="833.35" dur="4.47">much they&amp;#39;re actually spending because</text>
  <text start="834.7" dur="5.67">that money is really not yours you never</text>
  <text start="837.82" dur="4.29">had it in the first place and this is</text>
  <text start="840.37" dur="3.39">why there&amp;#39;s many people out there paying</text>
  <text start="842.11" dur="3.42">off credit cards because they</text>
  <text start="843.76" dur="4.8">continually go out and purchase and</text>
  <text start="845.53" dur="4.59">purchase and purchase their they reach</text>
  <text start="848.56" dur="3.12">the max on their credit cards and they</text>
  <text start="850.12" dur="2.159">can&amp;#39;t purchase anymore and they have to</text>
  <text start="851.68" dur="2.339">start paying</text>
  <text start="852.279" dur="4.17">it off but with the high interest rates</text>
  <text start="854.019" dur="3.841">it&amp;#39;s very very difficult and a lot of</text>
  <text start="856.449" dur="3.93">the country I would say the majority of</text>
  <text start="857.86" dur="3.57">the country this is the type of shape</text>
  <text start="860.379" dur="2.791">they&amp;#39;re in right now</text>
  <text start="861.43" dur="3.06">where they&amp;#39;re struggling to stay alive</text>
  <text start="863.17" dur="6.839">every single day</text>
  <text start="864.49" dur="8.37">how long can an economy survive it can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="870.009" dur="5.87">survive that long on this type of</text>
  <text start="872.86" dur="5.19">program on this type of an economy</text>
  <text start="875.879" dur="4.301">eventually what will happen it will</text>
