  <text start="134.32" dur="4.5">showing that yes everything is great</text>
  <text start="136.269" dur="6.331">again but what&amp;#39;s very interesting is if</text>
  <text start="138.82" dur="6.84">we go back to the year 2012 going into</text>
  <text start="142.6" dur="7.46">2013 that&amp;#39;s when everything completely</text>
  <text start="145.66" dur="8.76">fell apart and from 2013 all the way to</text>

  <text start="166.9" dur="3.059">buybacks</text>
  <text start="167.65" dur="4.77">they laid off a lot of individuals and</text>
  <text start="169.959" dur="4.351">now they&amp;#39;re telling us that the</text>
  <text start="172.42" dur="3.539">company&amp;#39;s doing well and this is not the</text>
  <text start="174.31" dur="3.84">first company that we&amp;#39;ve seen this we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="175.959" dur="4.471">seen it many many times before now very</text>
  <text start="178.15" dur="4.77">interestingly UBS is out there and</text>
  <text start="180.43" dur="4.919">they&amp;#39;re saying listen this information</text>
  <text start="182.92" dur="3.19">that&amp;#39;s coming out of all these different</text>
  <text start="185.349" dur="3.071">countries</text>
  <text start="186.11" dur="5.28">in the United States all this survey</text>
  <text start="188.42" dur="8.19">information well this stuff isn&amp;#39;t real</text>
  <text start="191.39" dur="7.5">this is fake economics and what we seen</text>
  <text start="196.61" dur="4.41">right now is that the services and</text>
  <text start="198.89" dur="4.08">manufacturing in America they came out</text>
  <text start="201.02" dur="4.35">with their new survey manufacturing PMI</text>
  <text start="202.97" dur="3.66">and this is showing that everything is</text>
  <text start="205.37" dur="4.05">fine and everything&amp;#39;s great</text>
  <text start="206.63" dur="5.94">and the UBS chief economist Paul Donovan</text>
  <text start="209.42" dur="4.65">explains that this is fake economics the</text>
  <text start="212.57" dur="3.72">trend of correlation between these</text>
  <text start="214.07" dur="4.5">numbers and reality is declining an</text>
  <text start="216.29" dur="4.77">investor should ask themselves when did</text>
  <text start="218.57" dur="5.1">I last voluntarily fill in a survey</text>
  <text start="221.06" dur="5.73">before placing faith in survey evidence</text>
  <text start="223.67" dur="7.89">and he&amp;#39;s absolutely right all this</text>
  <text start="226.79" dur="7.02">survey data is absolutely meaningless we</text>
  <text start="231.56" dur="4.62">see right now that the so-called same</text>
  <text start="233.81" dur="5.33">group of stocks which is Facebook Amazon</text>
  <text start="236.18" dur="5.04">Netflix Google fell for the fifth day</text>
  <text start="239.14" dur="3.97">yesterday this is the longest losing</text>
  <text start="241.22" dur="4.44">streak since right after the election</text>
  <text start="243.11" dur="4.56">and remember the fangs have been pumped</text>
  <text start="245.66" dur="3.78">up by the central banks by easy money</text>
  <text start="247.67" dur="4.23">and they&amp;#39;re trying to make it look like</text>
  <text start="249.44" dur="4.86">everything is fine by saying that the</text>
  <text start="251.9" dur="3.9">faying tech stocks have been doing great</text>
  <text start="254.3" dur="3.42">and we&amp;#39;ve seen this in the past before</text>
  <text start="255.8" dur="3.749">where they take a group of stocks they</text>
  <text start="257.72" dur="4.38">use this to show that everything is</text>
  <text start="259.549" dur="4.261">great while all the other companies and</text>
  <text start="262.1" dur="4.17">the smaller companies are doing horribly</text>
  <text start="263.81" dur="4.23">they show us that everything is great</text>
  <text start="266.27" dur="3.84">but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is they</text>
  <text start="268.04" dur="2.67">are starting to drop in it doesn&amp;#39;t look</text>
  <text start="270.11" dur="3.24">that great</text>
  <text start="270.71" dur="4.44">now analysts they&amp;#39;re cutting</text>
  <text start="273.35" dur="3.39">expectations for the big tech firms</text>
  <text start="275.15" dur="4.92">ahead of earnings the problem is</text>
  <text start="276.74" dur="6.06">analysts are saying that well how could</text>
  <text start="280.07" dur="6.27">this be happening because it looks like</text>
  <text start="282.8" dur="6.63">their sales their revenue well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="286.34" dur="5.46">dropping and how can their stocks be at</text>
  <text start="289.43" dur="4.23">an average 74 times earnings the</text>
  <text start="291.8" dur="5.25">multiple is three times that of the S&amp;amp;P</text>
  <text start="293.66" dur="5.79">500 and it&amp;#39;s not just the tech stocks</text>
  <text start="297.05" dur="5.73">it&amp;#39;s the biotechs they&amp;#39;re stumbling hard</text>
  <text start="299.45" dur="5.42">to down 6% from recent highs and it</text>
  <text start="302.78" dur="5.06">looks like things are getting worse now</text>
  <text start="304.87" dur="5.98">Kotlikoff who was an an economist is</text>
  <text start="307.84" dur="6.73">saying you know something isn&amp;#39;t right</text>
  <text start="310.85" dur="6.39">here and he&amp;#39;s saying that America is in</text>
  <text start="314.57" dur="5.37">worse financial shape than Russia or</text>
  <text start="317.24" dur="4.8">China now America&amp;#39;s 27</text>
  <text start="319.94" dur="5.19">fiscal gap will come in near six</text>
  <text start="322.04" dur="4.86">trillion nine times higher than the six</text>
  <text start="325.13" dur="2.82">hundred and sixty six billion deficit</text>
  <text start="326.9" dur="3.15">announced by the US Department of</text>
  <text start="327.95" dur="5.33">Treasury last week and Laurence</text>
  <text start="330.05" dur="7.44">Kotlikoff is saying that something is</text>
  <text start="333.28" dur="6.22">broke the country is broke so what is he</text>
  <text start="337.49" dur="4.14">really looking at well he&amp;#39;s looking at</text>
  <text start="339.5" dur="5.55">the accounting methods that the US</text>
  <text start="341.63" dur="6.3">government uses and by his estimates the</text>
  <text start="345.05" dur="6.21">total US government debts are more than</text>
  <text start="347.93" dur="4.17">200 trillion when unfunded liabilities</text>
  <text start="351.26" dur="4.2">are included</text>
  <text start="352.1" dur="4.89">now he&amp;#39;s explaining this to Congress</text>
  <text start="355.46" dur="4.53">because he&amp;#39;s testifying in front of</text>
  <text start="356.99" dur="5.64">Congress right now and he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="359.99" dur="5.19">government officials they are well aware</text>
  <text start="362.63" dur="4.77">that many America&amp;#39;s debts and accrued</text>
  <text start="365.18" dur="6.27">liabilities well they&amp;#39;re being written</text>
  <text start="367.4" dur="6.54">off the books and many of those</text>
  <text start="371.45" dur="4.32">individuals who know about this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="373.94" dur="4.73">keeping their mouths shut</text>
  <text start="375.77" dur="7.05">he&amp;#39;s saying we are working with a</text>
  <text start="378.67" dur="6.34">two-tiered reporting system and the</text>
  <text start="382.82" dur="5.88">two-tier financial reporting system is</text>
  <text start="385.01" dur="5.79">as follows where politicians insiders</text>
  <text start="388.7" dur="4.41">have access to key data buried in</text>
  <text start="390.8" dur="3.99">footnotes about unfunded liabilities</text>
  <text start="393.11" dur="3.69">which indicate that there are huge</text>
  <text start="394.79" dur="4.95">problems in the economy the public on</text>
  <text start="396.8" dur="4.95">the other hand well they&amp;#39;re listening to</text>
  <text start="399.74" dur="4.26">the corporate media they&amp;#39;re listening to</text>
  <text start="401.75" dur="6.21">the White House they&amp;#39;re listening to the</text>
  <text start="404" dur="6.84">Fed and they believe that everything is</text>
  <text start="407.96" dur="6.12">fine and they&amp;#39;re saying that the economy</text>
  <text start="410.84" dur="5.49">is doing well and he&amp;#39;s saying that this</text>
  <text start="414.08" dur="4.08">needs to be changed because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="416.33" dur="4.88">working with two different systems and</text>
  <text start="418.16" dur="6.21">those who are really looking at the</text>
  <text start="421.21" dur="5.86">entire budget looking at the economy of</text>
  <text start="424.37" dur="5.58">the United States they realize that the</text>
  <text start="427.07" dur="6.21">economy is not doing well but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="429.95" dur="5.13">not saying anything and there are more</text>
  <text start="433.28" dur="4.8">than 1,200 of the country&amp;#39;s top</text>
  <text start="435.08" dur="5.73">economists they have endorsed this new</text>
  <text start="438.08" dur="4.95">plan that he&amp;#39;s trying to put out there</text>
  <text start="440.81" dur="4.74">there they&amp;#39;re all trying to put this out</text>
  <text start="443.03" dur="5.509">there saying that the Congressional</text>
  <text start="445.55" dur="5.58">Budget Office needs to do fiscal gap and</text>
  <text start="448.539" dur="3.641">generational accounting on an ongoing</text>
  <text start="451.13" dur="2.31">basis</text>
  <text start="452.18" dur="4.86">now this</text>
  <text start="453.44" dur="8.67">methodology was tried once before by</text>
  <text start="457.04" dur="7.29">George Bush Senior and he included the</text>
  <text start="462.11" dur="4.53">fiscal gap accounting in some of his</text>
  <text start="464.33" dur="4.17">budgeting now it wasn&amp;#39;t widespread they</text>
  <text start="466.64" dur="3.93">started to do this but when Clinton came</text>
  <text start="468.5" dur="5.28">into office the Clinton administration</text>
  <text start="470.57" dur="7.26">killed the practice and it was never</text>
  <text start="473.78" dur="5.52">followed up so decades later few people</text>
  <text start="477.83" dur="3.54">realized that the only reason that the</text>
  <text start="479.3" dur="5.37">Clintons were able to balance their</text>
  <text start="481.37" dur="7.62">budgets was not by recording all the US</text>
  <text start="484.67" dur="5.94">government debts now george w bush also</text>
  <text start="488.99" dur="5.19">did the same thing they didn&amp;#39;t account</text>
  <text start="490.61" dur="5.79">for the wars and this has been going on</text>
  <text start="494.18" dur="4.35">for quite a while where they leave</text>
  <text start="496.4" dur="4.89">certain things out can you imagine if</text>
  <text start="498.53" dur="4.56">you were able to do this in your own</text>
  <text start="501.29" dur="5.85">household saying hey you know something</text>
  <text start="503.09" dur="6.69">I&amp;#39;m just not gonna count my car payment</text>
  <text start="507.14" dur="4.83">I&amp;#39;m not gonna have a count for I&amp;#39;m not</text>

  <text start="513.44" dur="5.729">pretend they just don&amp;#39;t exist this is</text>
  <text start="515.69" dur="4.74">what the government does and this is why</text>
  <text start="519.169" dur="4.68">when they come out with these numbers</text>
  <text start="520.43" dur="5.13">it&amp;#39;s very fancy manipulated accounting</text>
  <text start="523.849" dur="3.571">to make everyone think that everything</text>
  <text start="525.56" dur="4.23">is fine but what he&amp;#39;s uncovered is that</text>
  <text start="527.42" dur="5.55">they understand and they already know</text>
  <text start="529.79" dur="6.27">that the whole entire system is in a</text>
  <text start="532.97" dur="6.18">huge bunch of trouble and this is why</text>
  <text start="536.06" dur="6.21">they cannot stop borrowing from the Fed</text>
  <text start="539.15" dur="4.32">they can&amp;#39;t balance anything they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="542.27" dur="3.75">gonna be able to bring manufacturing</text>
  <text start="543.47" dur="4.98">back they&amp;#39;re not gonna be able to save</text>
  <text start="546.02" dur="6.14">the economy it&amp;#39;s completely impossible</text>
  <text start="548.45" dur="7.05">at this point unless we start to cut a</text>
  <text start="552.16" dur="6.61">lot of these programs and people will</text>
  <text start="555.5" dur="7.17">become very angry so we have two things</text>
  <text start="558.77" dur="6.18">that we can do at this point one we can</text>
  <text start="562.67" dur="3.99">say all right listen and this is the</text>
  <text start="564.95" dur="4.92">same that goes in anyone&amp;#39;s household</text>

  <text start="594.44" dur="5.39">lot of people can&amp;#39;t do this people you</text>
  <text start="596.06" dur="6.69">find it very difficult to do this well</text>
  <text start="599.83" dur="5.86">the government needs to do this but</text>
  <text start="602.75" dur="5.19">again the American people would become</text>
  <text start="605.69" dur="4.23">very angry and those people in</text>
  <text start="607.94" dur="4.829">government will sit there and take the</text>
  <text start="609.92" dur="5.55">blame for it or they can let the whole</text>
  <text start="612.769" dur="4.32">system crash which I think this is what</text>
  <text start="615.47" dur="6.27">they&amp;#39;re heading for because once again</text>
  <text start="617.089" dur="6.331">if the system comes down and they do all</text>
  <text start="621.74" dur="3.659">of this well the Fed is going to be</text>
  <text start="623.42" dur="4.05">blamed the government officials are</text>
  <text start="625.399" dur="6.021">gonna be blamed and they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="627.47" dur="6.48">to happen if there&amp;#39;s a collapse with</text>
  <text start="631.42" dur="3.76">someone else to blame and of course</text>
  <text start="633.95" dur="3.06">they&amp;#39;re not just gonna have a collapse</text>
  <text start="635.18" dur="3.24">and say hey it was our fault the</text>
  <text start="637.01" dur="4.17">collapse is going to be triggered by</text>
  <text start="638.42" dur="4.32">somebody else what I mean by this is</text>
  <text start="641.18" dur="3.36">going to be triggered by another country</text>
  <text start="642.74" dur="4.02">another group either through a cyber</text>
  <text start="644.54" dur="5.52">attack a cyber attack in a physical</text>
  <text start="646.76" dur="5.99">event or anything they&amp;#39;re above and they</text>
  <text start="650.06" dur="5.94">will blame this on that other group and</text>
  <text start="652.75" dur="7">this way they can say hey we were in a</text>
