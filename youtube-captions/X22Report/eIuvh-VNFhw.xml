  <text start="193.24" dur="6.24">everything I mean if we look at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="197.11" dur="5.6">going on in the world right now we</text>
  <text start="199.48" dur="6.87">understand that china is pushing their</text>
  <text start="202.71" dur="4.96">currency to be the next reserve currency</text>
  <text start="206.35" dur="3.66">we&amp;#39;re seeing they&amp;#39;re making bilateral</text>
  <text start="207.67" dur="4.74">trades all over the place we see that</text>
  <text start="210.01" dur="4.5">Zimbabwe has become the first African</text>
  <text start="212.41" dur="4.55">nation to take on new one and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="214.51" dur="5.22">seeing cracks in other African nations</text>
  <text start="216.96" dur="5.5">some of Africa&amp;#39;s largest economies</text>
  <text start="219.73" dur="5.97">including Nigeria Angola Ethiopia and</text>
  <text start="222.46" dur="6.72">many others are now restricting access</text>
  <text start="225.7" dur="5.94">to the dollar why because they have</text>
  <text start="229.18" dur="3.51">shortages in their reserves and a lot of</text>
  <text start="231.64" dur="3.6">these countries are saying you know</text>
  <text start="232.69" dur="5.67">something maybe it&amp;#39;s time to switch over</text>
  <text start="235.24" dur="6.21">to the yuan renminbi maybe it&amp;#39;s time to</text>
  <text start="238.36" dur="4.85">dump the dollar and move over and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="241.45" dur="5.91">seeing a lot of this because in Nigeria</text>
  <text start="243.21" dur="6.64">specifically their main export is oil</text>
  <text start="247.36" dur="4.65">and the dollar shortage in their</text>
  <text start="249.85" dur="4.5">reserves comes as an inflow of dollars</text>
  <text start="252.01" dur="5.22">from resources exports from oil from</text>
  <text start="254.35" dur="5.76">cotton and they have plummeted with</text>
  <text start="257.23" dur="6.84">prices of these commodities falling and</text>
  <text start="260.11" dur="5.61">declining and crashing the commodity</text>
  <text start="264.07" dur="3.75">route also is putting pressure on local</text>
  <text start="265.72" dur="3.6">currencies which some central banks are</text>
  <text start="267.82" dur="6.12">trying to support with their dwindling</text>
  <text start="269.32" dur="7.47">supply of dollars and Nigeria is</text>
  <text start="273.94" dur="5.82">introducing capital controls they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="276.79" dur="4.59">looking for a solution to this and one</text>
  <text start="279.76" dur="3.96">of their solutions are looking at is the</text>
  <text start="281.38" dur="5.34">u1 same thing within gola same thing</text>
  <text start="283.72" dur="5.34">with Ethiopia and we&amp;#39;re going to we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="286.72" dur="5.55">going to see this spread across the</text>
  <text start="289.06" dur="5.76">African nations Russia has made an</text>
  <text start="292.27" dur="4.59">agreement with India Russia will supply</text>
  <text start="294.82" dur="6.96">India oil refineries with 10</text>
  <text start="296.86" dur="6.929">tons of oil annually for 10 years indian</text>
  <text start="301.78" dur="4.62">companies have also expressed interest</text>
  <text start="303.789" dur="6">in getting natural gas from russia and</text>
  <text start="306.4" dur="6.15">most likely all of this is going to be</text>
  <text start="309.789" dur="7.711">taking place bypassing the dollar</text>
  <text start="312.55" dur="7.38">completely using their own currency or</text>
  <text start="317.5" dur="6.96">maybe the yuan or maybe the ruble but</text>
  <text start="319.93" dur="9.57">not the dollar we&amp;#39;re seeing here in the</text>
  <text start="324.46" dur="7.259">United States we understand that the US</text>
  <text start="329.5" dur="6.15">government central bankers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="331.719" dur="6.75">spying on every single person they are</text>
  <text start="335.65" dur="5.66">putting pressure on those people who are</text>
  <text start="338.469" dur="5.491">speaking out against the government and</text>
  <text start="341.31" dur="5.919">recently there&amp;#39;s been unclassified d.h</text>
  <text start="343.96" dur="5.669">documents which prove local law</text>

  <text start="375.099" dur="5.81">well they&amp;#39;re targeting individuals that</text>
  <text start="378.24" dur="6.07">recognize the government authority but</text>
  <text start="380.909" dur="5.41">those individuals that engage in acts of</text>
  <text start="384.31" dur="3.09">violence due to their perception that</text>

  <text start="402.129" dur="6.481">government and express their differences</text>
  <text start="404.77" dur="7.35">but they need to remember how this</text>
  <text start="408.61" dur="6.169">country was formed I mean these are the</text>
  <text start="412.12" dur="6.06">same activities that are going on today</text>
  <text start="414.779" dur="8.56">that happened back when our founding</text>

  <text start="430.8" dur="6">back scenario is now repeating itself</text>
  <text start="433.889" dur="6.09">and remember the founding fathers they</text>
  <text start="436.8" dur="6.839">started off very peaceful until they</text>
  <text start="439.979" dur="6.15">were forced into fighting they wanted to</text>
  <text start="443.639" dur="5.041">have a peaceful outcome to the entire</text>
  <text start="446.129" dur="5.82">situation but that didn&amp;#39;t go over well</text>

  <text start="494.09" dur="5.859">especially Libya out to Yemen they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="498.419" dur="4.321">trying to protect them because they see</text>
  <text start="499.949" dur="5.4">that Russia is actually destroying their</text>
  <text start="502.74" dur="4.289">proxy or me and they&amp;#39;re trying to stop</text>
  <text start="505.349" dur="3.901">this now out in Japan we know the United</text>
  <text start="507.029" dur="5.401">States is continually putting pressure</text>
  <text start="509.25" dur="5.37">on Japan to build this new base and the</text>
  <text start="512.43" dur="5.13">governor of Okinawa he has filed a</text>
  <text start="514.62" dur="6.33">lawsuit now and said he is not going to</text>
  <text start="517.56" dur="5.64">stop until he gets this thing through</text>
  <text start="520.95" dur="6.29">and he stops the Japanese government</text>
  <text start="523.2" dur="7.889">from building a military base on his</text>
  <text start="527.24" dur="5.83">area and he said he will resort to every</text>
  <text start="531.089" dur="5.821">possible measure and will not allow the</text>
  <text start="533.07" dur="5.37">new base to be built in Okinawa and of</text>
  <text start="536.91" dur="3.84">course they want the base built there</text>
  <text start="538.44" dur="4.98">because this way they can bring in more</text>
  <text start="540.75" dur="5.73">advanced military assets more troops to</text>
  <text start="543.42" dur="5.58">the area and this is going to help with</text>
  <text start="546.48" dur="6.93">the upcoming war they need a base in</text>
  <text start="549" dur="6.779">this area out in Ukraine we are seeing</text>
  <text start="553.41" dur="4.2">that the OSCE they are investigating</text>
  <text start="555.779" dur="4.111">shelling which was been done by the</text>
  <text start="557.61" dur="5.91">Ukrainian government and as they were</text>

  <text start="571.83" dur="4.23">entire area and now they are not</text>
  <text start="574.11" dur="3.84">investigating until they can figure out</text>
  <text start="576.06" dur="5.58">how they can get back into that area</text>
  <text start="577.95" dur="4.77">without the snipers there and of course</text>
  <text start="581.64" dur="2.85">when they talk to the Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="582.72" dur="3.57">government and they say what about these</text>
