  <text start="81.86" dur="8.6">that Greece is doing fine everything is</text>
  <text start="85.09" dur="5.37">okay now they told us this back in 2009</text>
  <text start="91.42" dur="7.78">2011-2012 2014 but each year it seems</text>
  <text start="97.369" dur="4.32">that they needed more and more of the</text>
  <text start="99.2" dur="4.909">bailout until we got to the point where</text>
  <text start="101.689" dur="6.661">they need even more of the bailout and</text>
  <text start="104.109" dur="7.21">right now the Greek economy has shrunk</text>

  <text start="133.61" dur="3.72">the bankers are trying to convince us</text>
  <text start="135.26" dur="5.4">that it&amp;#39;s doing and that is recovering</text>
  <text start="137.33" dur="7.89">because of the bailouts actually it is</text>
  <text start="140.66" dur="7.59">getting worse and as time goes on and as</text>

  <text start="209.05" dur="5.23">ranges from twelve percent all the way</text>

  <text start="216.14" dur="5.66">they&amp;#39;re unemployed not making money you</text>

  <text start="229.03" dur="7.14">now here in the states in the United</text>
  <text start="231.56" dur="6.6">States they are pushing the idea that</text>
  <text start="236.17" dur="5.77">because we&amp;#39;re at five percent</text>
  <text start="238.16" dur="8.43">unemployment we are completely at full</text>
  <text start="241.94" dur="7.26">employment and the economy is perfectly</text>
  <text start="246.59" dur="6.179">fine this is what they want you to</text>
  <text start="249.2" dur="7.8">believe at this time but something odd</text>
  <text start="252.769" dur="6.381">is happening in the US labor market the</text>
  <text start="257" dur="5.91">BLS reports in its latest jobs report</text>
  <text start="259.15" dur="6.37">the number of hires has exceeded the</text>
  <text start="262.91" dur="6.93">number of job openings for most of the</text>
  <text start="265.52" dur="7.11">jolts history so the hires exceeded the</text>
  <text start="269.84" dur="5.69">amount of jobs that were open over the</text>
  <text start="272.63" dur="6.9">past year this relationship has changed</text>
  <text start="275.53" dur="10.36">as job openings have outnumbered hires</text>
  <text start="279.53" dur="9.33">for several months they&amp;#39;ve crossed this</text>
  <text start="285.89" dur="6.27">is very odd so what is really happening</text>
  <text start="288.86" dur="5.33">is that the hires have plateaued the</text>
  <text start="292.16" dur="5.58">last time we seen such a dramatic peak</text>
  <text start="294.19" dur="6.58">was back in 2005 and 2006</text>
  <text start="297.74" dur="9.51">just before the economy and the market</text>
  <text start="300.77" dur="9.179">crashed in 2008 now the jolt economist</text>
  <text start="307.25" dur="4.169">and the BLS are very confused there</text>
  <text start="309.949" dur="3.271">they&amp;#39;re saying you know we can&amp;#39;t put our</text>
  <text start="311.419" dur="4.141">finger on this why this is happening and</text>
  <text start="313.22" dur="5.849">I mentioned this before in other reports</text>
  <text start="315.56" dur="9.27">when I work for major corporations in</text>
  <text start="319.069" dur="8.761">Manhattan many times what they did was</text>
  <text start="324.83" dur="5.07">they would have job wrecks and they</text>
  <text start="327.83" dur="3.72">would keep them open because in that</text>
  <text start="329.9" dur="4.29">department if they decided they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="331.55" dur="3.66">need that job they lose the job req and</text>
  <text start="334.19" dur="2.909">they wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to get one back</text>
  <text start="335.21" dur="3.989">because it&amp;#39;s very difficult to fight for</text>
  <text start="337.099" dur="6.781">another one so they would leave them</text>
  <text start="339.199" dur="8.31">open and say yes we do have jobs but</text>
  <text start="343.88" dur="7.529">never hire anyone because there really</text>
  <text start="347.509" dur="6.72">wasn&amp;#39;t a position and this is part of</text>
  <text start="351.409" dur="6.69">the problem here a lot of corporations</text>
  <text start="354.229" dur="9.24">are doing this type of practice of</text>
  <text start="358.099" dur="7.32">keeping the job Rex open and this is why</text>
  <text start="363.469" dur="4.891">people saying there&amp;#39;s plenty of jobs out</text>
  <text start="365.419" dur="7.291">there no they&amp;#39;re not it&amp;#39;s an illusion</text>
  <text start="368.36" dur="8">and we have to remember there&amp;#39;s 94 plus</text>
  <text start="372.71" dur="8.67">million people out on the labor force</text>
  <text start="376.36" dur="7.299">who can&amp;#39;t find work so yeah this</text>
  <text start="381.38" dur="4.95">something wrong here and I&amp;#39;m getting</text>
  <text start="383.659" dur="5.25">emails on top of emails of people saying</text>
  <text start="386.33" dur="6.03">yes I was laid off I&amp;#39;ve been putting my</text>
  <text start="388.909" dur="8.01">resume out and it&amp;#39;s like nothing is out</text>
  <text start="392.36" dur="6.119">there not no one&amp;#39;s even responding and a</text>
  <text start="396.919" dur="4.981">lot of people are getting nervous about</text>
  <text start="398.479" dur="5.901">this and we can see from challenger gray</text>
  <text start="401.9" dur="5.22">&amp;amp; christmas that layoffs are</text>
  <text start="404.38" dur="6.36">accelerating if we go back to june of</text>
  <text start="407.12" dur="7.109">2014 to the present we are approaching 1</text>
  <text start="410.74" dur="7.329">million layoffs and layoffs are</text>
  <text start="414.229" dur="5.791">continuing and they&amp;#39;re going to continue</text>
  <text start="418.069" dur="5.4">because guess what this holiday season</text>
  <text start="420.02" dur="5.579">coming up is going to be one of the</text>
  <text start="423.469" dur="5.581">biggest disasters we&amp;#39;ve seen since the</text>
  <text start="425.599" dur="6.35">Great Depression I know we&amp;#39;re at five</text>
  <text start="429.05" dur="6.419">percent unemployment near full and</text>
  <text start="431.949" dur="5.381">well that should then we should be able</text>
  <text start="435.469" dur="4.38">to take those numbers and then turn that</text>
  <text start="437.33" dur="4.079">into hmm a lot more people have money a</text>
  <text start="439.849" dur="3.81">lot more people have the ability to</text>
  <text start="441.409" dur="4.29">spend that means retail should expand</text>
  <text start="443.659" dur="8.391">they should hire more people in retail</text>
  <text start="445.699" dur="11.03">and Christmas should be incredible and</text>
  <text start="452.05" dur="7.78">we should see Black Friday Cyber Monday</text>
  <text start="456.729" dur="6.73">incredible incredible amount of sales</text>
  <text start="459.83" dur="7.039">during this time but already we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="463.459" dur="7.23">seeing that this is not the case right</text>
  <text start="466.869" dur="6.34">now retail sales are stagnant ahead of</text>
  <text start="470.689" dur="6.62">the holidays which we knew they were</text>
  <text start="473.209" dur="8.07">going to be because if you believe the</text>
  <text start="477.309" dur="8.14">government statistical manipulated</text>
  <text start="481.279" dur="5.85">numbers it would make sense that this</text>
  <text start="485.449" dur="3.541">holiday season and leading up to the</text>
  <text start="487.129" dur="6.171">holiday should be incredible because the</text>
  <text start="488.99" dur="9.179">unemployment continually decreases since</text>
  <text start="493.3" dur="6.549">2008 and as the unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="498.169" dur="3.33">decreases that means more people are</text>
  <text start="499.849" dur="3.63">working more people have money more</text>
  <text start="501.499" dur="5.51">people are saving and more people can</text>
  <text start="503.479" dur="7.65">spend but why is the opposite happening</text>
  <text start="507.009" dur="6.94">macy&amp;#39;s nordstrom JC Penney and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="511.129" dur="5.07">slew of other stores that are coming up</text>
  <text start="513.949" dur="7.32">and saying you know something sales are</text>
  <text start="516.199" dur="7.231">way down sales are falling in our store</text>
  <text start="521.269" dur="5.281">we can&amp;#39;t explain it the weather is nice</text>
  <text start="523.43" dur="5.969">maybe that&amp;#39;s why maybe we&amp;#39;ll blame it on</text>
  <text start="526.55" dur="5.58">the snow once we get into the winter but</text>
  <text start="529.399" dur="5.341">right now nobody wants to say it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="532.13" dur="5.939">economy nobody wants to say it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="534.74" dur="6.829">people cannot find jobs nobody wants to</text>
  <text start="538.069" dur="5.491">say that the unemployment rate is fake</text>
  <text start="541.569" dur="4.301">so they&amp;#39;re trying to look at all</text>
  <text start="543.56" dur="4.949">different things I mean right now</text>
  <text start="545.87" dur="5.19">October sales we&amp;#39;ve seen a decline in</text>
  <text start="548.509" dur="7.291">motor sales parts electronics food</text>
  <text start="551.06" dur="6.959">beverage gasoline general merchandise do</text>
  <text start="555.8" dur="8.729">we think this is going to get any better</text>
  <text start="558.019" dur="7.051">as we go into the holiday season now it</text>
  <text start="564.529" dur="6.531">is</text>
  <text start="565.07" dur="8.7">I mean 2014 was a complete disaster and</text>
  <text start="571.06" dur="6.1">at that point where were we almost six</text>
  <text start="573.77" dur="8.07">percent unemployment compared to 20 12</text>
  <text start="577.16" dur="7.41">2011 2010 so how is this going to be any</text>
  <text start="581.84" dur="5.67">better this year it isn&amp;#39;t because the</text>
  <text start="584.57" dur="9.5">government is lying to us now the</text>
  <text start="587.51" dur="6.56">year-over-year gains in retail is again-</text>
  <text start="594.13" dur="8.85">if we look at the retail graph we see</text>
  <text start="599.42" dur="8.94">that we&amp;#39;re in a downward trend since</text>
  <text start="602.98" dur="8.53">2008 when they pumped it up in 2009-10</text>
  <text start="608.36" dur="6">and as the economy went along and people</text>
  <text start="611.51" dur="7.29">lost their jobs because of layoffs sales</text>
  <text start="614.36" dur="9.02">declining store is closing we see the</text>
  <text start="618.8" dur="8.85">retail sales continually decline since</text>
  <text start="623.38" dur="6.67">2010 and 2010 the unemployment rate was</text>
  <text start="627.65" dur="6.12">much higher this is when they really</text>
  <text start="630.05" dur="7.5">pushed the manipulation to convince</text>
  <text start="633.77" dur="5.07">everyone that we&amp;#39;re okay and when we</text>
  <text start="637.55" dur="3.84">look at this data and we look at this</text>
  <text start="638.84" dur="4.89">information we can see that yeah this</text>
  <text start="641.39" dur="6.87">whole thing is not what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="643.73" dur="6.93">now the the the picture is very clear</text>
  <text start="648.26" dur="4.95">when you&amp;#39;re excluding the debt bubble</text>
  <text start="650.66" dur="5.4">funded auto spending spree when you</text>
  <text start="653.21" dur="4.86">exclude autos what we find is that the</text>
  <text start="656.06" dur="9.21">last two times retail sales were this</text>
  <text start="658.07" dur="11.69">week the US was already in recession the</text>
  <text start="665.27" dur="7.65">BLS also reported that October PPI is</text>
  <text start="669.76" dur="5.47">also a disaster at negative one point</text>
  <text start="672.92" dur="4.41">six percent down from negative 1 point 1</text>
  <text start="675.23" dur="4.71">percent they expected a negative one</text>
  <text start="677.33" dur="6.72">point two percent but it is much much</text>
  <text start="679.94" dur="6.6">worse than they expected I mean</text>

  <text start="691.91" dur="6.72">are plummeting and during this period</text>
  <text start="695.29" dur="5.35">sales should be doing a lot better</text>

  <text start="945.949" dur="8.841">fear of losing their principal what if</text>

  <text start="954.79" dur="7.07">people want to make interest on the</text>
  <text start="957.079" dur="8.351">money so their retirement grows</text>
  <text start="961.86" dur="5.19">and when he says that people are scared</text>
  <text start="965.43" dur="4.92">of losing their principal well guess</text>
  <text start="967.05" dur="7.56">what you put your hard-earned currency</text>
  <text start="970.35" dur="7.65">in that pension plan that money will be</text>

  <text start="999.57" dur="6.3">thirty percent there&amp;#39;s no affordability</text>

  <text start="1028.1" dur="7.17">can&amp;#39;t control it they can&amp;#39;t print with</text>
  <text start="1031.76" dur="6.9">gold because there&amp;#39;s only certain ounces</text>
  <text start="1035.27" dur="6.21">of gold in the world so it keeps the</text>
  <text start="1038.66" dur="6.33">central bankers in check but Russia</text>

  <text start="1069.64" dur="8.2">guarantee from legal and political risks</text>
  <text start="1074.83" dur="5.29">so Russia sees gold reserves as a form</text>
  <text start="1077.84" dur="5.339">of monetary hedging and financial</text>
  <text start="1080.12" dur="4.74">insurance and they say we believe it is</text>

  <text start="1088.79" dur="8.71">uncertainties yes that&amp;#39;s what it is</text>
