  <text start="331.03" dur="3">african-americans Hispanics is much</text>
  <text start="333.58" dur="3.09">better</text>
  <text start="334.03" dur="5.46">Ryan Saavedra tweeted this information</text>
  <text start="336.67" dur="5.76">out take a listen to what Robert Johnson</text>
  <text start="339.49" dur="5.61">had to say well I think the economy is</text>
  <text start="342.43" dur="5.31">doing absolutely great and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="345.1" dur="5.16">particularly reaching into populations</text>
  <text start="347.74" dur="5.25">that heretofore have had very bad</text>
  <text start="350.26" dur="4.83">problems in terms of jobs employment and</text>
  <text start="352.99" dur="2.91">the opportunities that come with full</text>
  <text start="355.09" dur="3.42">employment</text>
  <text start="355.9" dur="5.19">so african-american unemployment is at</text>
  <text start="358.51" dur="5.7">its lowest level Hispanic unemployment</text>
  <text start="361.09" dur="5.04">women so I give President Trump and I</text>
  <text start="364.21" dur="4.53">said this before on Squawk Box I gave</text>
  <text start="366.13" dur="4.56">president a lot of credit for moving the</text>
  <text start="368.74" dur="4.53">economy in a positive direction that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="370.69" dur="5.09">benefiting a large number of Americans I</text>
  <text start="373.27" dur="4.47">think the tax cuts clearly helped</text>
  <text start="375.78" dur="4.27">stimulate the economy I think</text>
  <text start="377.74" dur="4.23">businesspeople have a little bit more</text>
  <text start="380.05" dur="3.69">confident in the way the economy is</text>
  <text start="381.97" dur="4.56">going and I think it&amp;#39;s beginning to have</text>
  <text start="383.74" dur="4.56">some impact globally now we still have</text>
  <text start="386.53" dur="5.13">some issues to deal with with the China</text>
  <text start="388.3" dur="5.52">trade negotiation issues but overall if</text>
  <text start="391.66" dur="4.47">you look at the US economy and you look</text>
  <text start="393.82" dur="5.73">at the number of people who are no</text>
  <text start="396.13" dur="5.43">longer and looking for jobs but now sort</text>
  <text start="399.55" dur="5.16">of seeing the opportunities for job</text>
  <text start="401.56" dur="6.81">growth I you got to give the president a</text>
  <text start="404.71" dur="6.57">an A+ for that so as you can see we</text>
  <text start="408.37" dur="4.71">reported a couple reports ago that a lot</text>
  <text start="411.28" dur="4.32">of the jobs that were created are</text>
  <text start="413.08" dur="5.31">helping the Hispanic community the</text>
  <text start="415.6" dur="6.42">african-american community and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="418.39" dur="8.48">seeing a huge lift right now who has the</text>
  <text start="422.02" dur="8.94">magic one who is in control the Patriots</text>
  <text start="426.87" dur="4.71">all these economists the mainstream</text>
  <text start="430.96" dur="2.86">media</text>
  <text start="431.58" dur="4.2">telling everyone it was gonna be a</text>
  <text start="433.82" dur="5.41">complete disaster</text>
  <text start="435.78" dur="7.17">if Trump was elected if you notice the</text>
  <text start="439.23" dur="5.37">opposite happened look at the UK they</text>
  <text start="442.95" dur="5.49">said the entire system will completely</text>
  <text start="444.6" dur="6.18">fall apart what has happened it hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="448.44" dur="4.4">fallen apart they said if Clinton got</text>
  <text start="450.78" dur="5.19">elected the economy would be fantastic</text>
  <text start="452.84" dur="7.87">actually it would have been the opposite</text>
  <text start="455.97" dur="7.98">and we need to understand is that right</text>
  <text start="460.71" dur="7.5">now this economy were in it is a</text>
  <text start="463.95" dur="7.19">complete illusion created by the central</text>
  <text start="468.21" dur="6.72">bank system and the mainstream media and</text>
  <text start="471.14" dur="7.6">Trump right now he can make the system</text>
  <text start="474.93" dur="6.78">go any way he wants they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="478.74" dur="6.75">it for a very long time he just took</text>
  <text start="481.71" dur="6.24">control over all of it now we know the</text>
  <text start="485.49" dur="5.46">main purpose of all this is to get rid</text>
  <text start="487.95" dur="6.6">of the central bank to restructure it</text>
  <text start="490.95" dur="7.47">have them do what the Patriots won and</text>
  <text start="494.55" dur="6.45">is this happening absolutely think about</text>
  <text start="498.42" dur="4.07">it every time Trump tweets out and he</text>
  <text start="501" dur="4.44">says listen I want the Fed to do this</text>
  <text start="502.49" dur="5.5">the mainstream media goes crazy you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="505.44" dur="5.04">not allowed to tell the Fed what to do</text>
  <text start="507.99" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;re independent the Fed thinks about</text>
  <text start="510.48" dur="3.45">it the Fed says okay maybe we will maybe</text>
  <text start="513.39" dur="2.67">we won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="513.93" dur="3.96">a couple months go by and they do</text>
  <text start="516.06" dur="2.97">exactly what Trump wants of course</text>
  <text start="517.89" dur="3.59">they&amp;#39;re not gonna do it right away</text>
  <text start="519.03" dur="8.97">because that would look suspicious</text>
  <text start="521.48" dur="9.04">now Trump wants the Fed to shift their</text>
  <text start="528" dur="5.84">policy remember Q has been telling us</text>
  <text start="530.52" dur="6.09">there is going to be a restructuring and</text>
  <text start="533.84" dur="5.77">to have this restructuring you need</text>
  <text start="536.61" dur="7.23">certain key players in place and you</text>
  <text start="539.61" dur="6.87">need to shift the policy of the Fed and</text>
  <text start="543.84" dur="5.7">what was the policy of the Fed well keep</text>
  <text start="546.48" dur="5.43">unemployment very very low and make sure</text>
  <text start="549.54" dur="4.68">there&amp;#39;s no inflation well it completely</text>
  <text start="551.91" dur="4.92">failed the only way they were able to</text>
  <text start="554.22" dur="5.91">keep this mandate was to manipulate all</text>
  <text start="556.83" dur="5.45">the numbers and to manipulate precious</text>
  <text start="560.13" dur="5.61">metals manipulate the stock market</text>
  <text start="562.28" dur="6.19">create stimulus bring down interest</text>
  <text start="565.74" dur="3.99">and make sure that this wasn&amp;#39;t an open</text>
  <text start="568.47" dur="4.56">and free market because if this was an</text>
  <text start="569.73" dur="6.9">open and free market guess what the</text>
  <text start="573.03" dur="7.35">entire system would implode so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="576.63" dur="6.06">living in an illusion which was created</text>
  <text start="580.38" dur="4.62">by the central bank but something very</text>
  <text start="582.69" dur="5.21">interesting happened now we need to</text>
  <text start="585" dur="7.29">remember why this is happening</text>
  <text start="587.9" dur="6.91">Trump is redoing all the globalist trade</text>
  <text start="592.29" dur="6.48">deals getting rid of a lot of them</text>
  <text start="594.81" dur="5.31">resetting redoing them reworking them or</text>
  <text start="598.77" dur="3.99">creating new ones</text>
  <text start="600.12" dur="5.37">why because the dollar the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="602.76" dur="5.49">will no longer be the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="605.49" dur="4.83">remember the united states depended on</text>
  <text start="608.25" dur="4.17">the reserve currency for other countries</text>
  <text start="610.32" dur="4.38">to take that dollar and purchase things</text>
  <text start="612.42" dur="6.51">from the united states that&amp;#39;s how it</text>
  <text start="614.7" dur="6.18">worked the new system the united states</text>
  <text start="618.93" dur="3.98">will not have the reserve currency and</text>
  <text start="620.88" dur="4.95">the reserve currency was propped up by</text>
  <text start="622.91" dur="7.93">war by regime change</text>
  <text start="625.83" dur="8.48">now we actually need to have trade so</text>
  <text start="630.84" dur="9.86">moving forward what is the new policy</text>
  <text start="634.31" dur="12.1">trade so the Federal Reserve Powell is</text>
  <text start="640.7" dur="11.2">looking to focus the entire Fed on a</text>
  <text start="646.41" dur="7.89">trade inspired policy shift he was</text>
  <text start="651.9" dur="6.72">testifying in front of Congress and said</text>
  <text start="654.3" dur="6.77">yes we need to shift our policies what</text>
  <text start="658.62" dur="5.28">we are watching right now is the</text>
  <text start="661.07" dur="5.77">restructuring of the Fed because now</text>
  <text start="663.9" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re looking at something completely</text>
  <text start="666.84" dur="3.06">different that they never looked before</text>
  <text start="668.28" dur="2.67">now of course the mainstream media and</text>
  <text start="669.9" dur="2.79">everyone else is gonna say well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="670.95" dur="3.6">because of Trump&amp;#39;s tariffs it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="672.69" dur="3.42">of what he&amp;#39;s doing this is why there has</text>
  <text start="674.55" dur="4.68">to be a shift and this is what we call</text>
  <text start="676.11" dur="5.69">optics the mainstream media believes the</text>
  <text start="679.23" dur="5.85">deep state believes that the Fed is</text>
  <text start="681.8" dur="6">shifting right now to deal with the</text>
  <text start="685.08" dur="7.44">tariffs that Trump is putting into place</text>
  <text start="687.8" dur="7.54">but the Fed is shifting because of the</text>
  <text start="692.52" dur="5.4">new economy this is the restructuring</text>
  <text start="695.34" dur="3.96">that is happening right in front of</text>
  <text start="697.92" dur="3.78">everyone</text>
  <text start="699.3" dur="4.38">and we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot more of</text>
  <text start="701.7" dur="5.13">this they&amp;#39;re not going to come in and</text>
  <text start="703.68" dur="5.01">say oh listen we have Judy Shelton now</text>
  <text start="706.83" dur="3.27">on the Federal Reserve Board we have</text>
  <text start="708.69" dur="4.709">another person on the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="710.1" dur="5.34">Board and by the way we&amp;#39;re going to stop</text>
  <text start="713.399" dur="4.831">the petrodollar today and start the gold</text>
  <text start="715.44" dur="5.49">standard now what they&amp;#39;re doing is the</text>
  <text start="718.23" dur="5.28">same thing the private west central</text>
  <text start="720.93" dur="6.599">bankers have done they&amp;#39;re building the</text>
  <text start="723.51" dur="6.62">new economy in the shadows they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="730.13" dur="8.38">so we can easily move from this central</text>
  <text start="734.339" dur="7.62">bank system over to a new system is the</text>
  <text start="738.51" dur="6.329">Fed going to be around while we</text>
  <text start="741.959" dur="5.911">transition yes but is it going to be</text>
  <text start="744.839" dur="7.051">private most likely not it will still</text>
  <text start="747.87" dur="6.589">handle certain aspects of creating the</text>
  <text start="751.89" dur="6.33">currency but I don&amp;#39;t believe it will be</text>
  <text start="754.459" dur="6.461">private I also believe the restructuring</text>
  <text start="758.22" dur="4.26">is going to happen on an incremental</text>
  <text start="760.92" dur="4.08">basis just like we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="762.48" dur="5.52">beginning stage here of a policy shift</text>
  <text start="765" dur="5.88">where they&amp;#39;re shifting to a trade</text>
  <text start="768" dur="5.91">inspired policy I believe we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="770.88" dur="5.699">see a lot more of this because they have</text>
  <text start="773.91" dur="5.73">to shift the way the Fed is right now to</text>
  <text start="776.579" dur="5.641">fit where we&amp;#39;re going and once</text>
  <text start="779.64" dur="6">everything is set and everything is in</text>
  <text start="782.22" dur="5.369">place this is when everything will start</text>
  <text start="785.64" dur="3.3">to turn around this is when the audit</text>
  <text start="787.589" dur="4.261">will start this is when everything else</text>
  <text start="788.94" dur="5.01">will start to show the Fed was not</text>
  <text start="791.85" dur="3.45">working in the favor of the people and</text>
  <text start="793.95" dur="3.78">this is why I said the Fed will still</text>
  <text start="795.3" dur="5.19">exist but the government will actually</text>
  <text start="797.73" dur="4.68">take it over and it will no longer a be</text>
  <text start="800.49" dur="4.32">a private corporation because once the</text>
  <text start="802.41" dur="4.38">audit is done they&amp;#39;re going to see that</text>
  <text start="804.81" dur="4.589">they were involved in a lot of criminal</text>
  <text start="806.79" dur="6.72">activity so in the beginning stages</text>
  <text start="809.399" dur="7.201">they&amp;#39;re going to be restructuring their</text>
  <text start="813.51" dur="6.6">policies within the Fed changing</text>
  <text start="816.6" dur="5.76">direction to prepare for what is coming</text>
  <text start="820.11" dur="5.159">you have to remember the plan is in many</text>
  <text start="822.36" dur="5.43">many stages we need to prepare for this</text>
  <text start="825.269" dur="4.801">brand new economic system it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="827.79" dur="5.01">be completely different</text>
  <text start="830.07" dur="5.639">then the central bank system which is</text>
  <text start="832.8" dur="6.83">based on debt this is going to be based</text>
  <text start="835.709" dur="7.05">on sound money wealth creating trade</text>
  <text start="839.63" dur="5.62">producing trading with other countries</text>
  <text start="842.759" dur="4.921">this new economy is going to be</text>
  <text start="845.25" dur="4.709">incredible actually if you go back to</text>
  <text start="847.68" dur="5.099">why more the Weimar Republic in Germany</text>
  <text start="849.959" dur="5.281">when currency was being inflated they</text>
  <text start="852.779" dur="4.971">continually printed and the currency was</text>
  <text start="855.24" dur="5.399">worth absolutely nothing all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="857.75" dur="5.56">they started over it was a reset they</text>
  <text start="860.639" dur="6.721">got rid of the central bank and all of a</text>
  <text start="863.31" dur="6.509">sudden the economy was fantastic people</text>
  <text start="867.36" dur="4.979">prospered people were saying that this</text>
  <text start="869.819" dur="5.401">is some type of miracle they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="872.339" dur="6.781">believe it but again the central bankers</text>
  <text start="875.22" dur="7.08">they didn&amp;#39;t like this because the world</text>
  <text start="879.12" dur="6.06">saw this economy without a private</text>
  <text start="882.3" dur="5.219">western central bank well we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="885.18" dur="7.2">see the same exact thing we&amp;#39;re going to</text>

  <text start="902.339" dur="5.61">before and now it&amp;#39;s incredible and this</text>
  <text start="906.149" dur="5.31">is when people are going to have to</text>
  <text start="907.949" dur="6.061">learn that the central bank system it</text>
  <text start="911.459" dur="4.711">does not benefit the people it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="914.01" dur="5.129">actually bad for the people it&amp;#39;s great</text>
  <text start="916.17" dur="6.899">for the 1% but it&amp;#39;s bad for the everyday</text>
