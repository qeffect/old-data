  <text start="292.11" dur="4.2">everyone&amp;#39;s jumping ship when everything</text>
  <text start="293.76" dur="4.16">goes under everyone who was involved</text>
  <text start="296.31" dur="2.66">they start to leave</text>
  <text start="297.92" dur="4.29">because they don&amp;#39;t want to be caught up</text>
  <text start="298.97" dur="6.9">in it now we&amp;#39;ve been talking about this</text>
  <text start="302.21" dur="10.05">economic illusion and to be clear this</text>
  <text start="305.87" dur="8.37">economy has not improved since 2008 when</text>
  <text start="312.26" dur="4.98">we went through the crisis in 2008 all</text>
  <text start="314.24" dur="5.1">the central bankers did was they created</text>
  <text start="317.24" dur="3.95">an illusion they manipulated numbers</text>
  <text start="319.34" dur="5.67">with the help with the deep state and</text>
  <text start="321.19" dur="6.55">they funded many different central banks</text>
  <text start="325.01" dur="6.06">banking systems to keep the system</text>
  <text start="327.74" dur="5.4">afloat and what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="331.07" dur="3.42">is since the central banks are pulling</text>
  <text start="333.14" dur="3.09">back and remember they had a different</text>
  <text start="334.49" dur="4.32">plan they thought they were going to</text>
  <text start="336.23" dur="5.43">pull back raise interest rates blame it</text>
  <text start="338.81" dur="4.65">on Trump and then keep control of the</text>
  <text start="341.66" dur="4.29">system and get rid of Trump but what did</text>
  <text start="343.46" dur="7.1">Trump do well he turned it all around</text>
  <text start="345.95" dur="9.56">and used their manipulation against them</text>
  <text start="350.56" dur="8.41">so the central banks they were on a path</text>
  <text start="355.51" dur="5.2">to get rid of their balance sheet to</text>
  <text start="358.97" dur="4.44">raise the interest rates and they just</text>
  <text start="360.71" dur="5.85">couldn&amp;#39;t do a 180 when they saw a Trump</text>
  <text start="363.41" dur="5.52">making the economy look fantastic they</text>
  <text start="366.56" dur="4.35">were stuck so they had to move forward</text>
  <text start="368.93" dur="3.33">to make it look like oh yeah</text>
  <text start="370.91" dur="3.96">this is what we&amp;#39;re gonna do anyhow</text>
  <text start="372.26" dur="4.89">everything is great but what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="374.87" dur="5.01">happening here is that since they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="377.15" dur="6.96">been dumping everything off of their</text>
  <text start="379.88" dur="7.2">books and raising rates the global money</text>
  <text start="384.11" dur="6.09">supply has declined rapidly over the</text>
  <text start="387.08" dur="5.67">last year and a half in fact global</text>
  <text start="390.2" dur="6.92">money supply growth using M 1 is now</text>
  <text start="392.75" dur="7.2">flirting with the low seen in mid 2008</text>
  <text start="397.12" dur="4.54">lower money supply growth has often</text>
  <text start="399.95" dur="4.17">pointed to weaker global economic</text>
  <text start="401.66" dur="4.38">momentum going forward in fact if one</text>
  <text start="404.12" dur="4.26">uses global industrial production growth</text>
  <text start="406.04" dur="5.58">as a proxy for the global economic</text>
  <text start="408.38" dur="6.36">expansion or contraction the world is</text>
  <text start="411.62" dur="4.86">now almost certainly in a recession the</text>
  <text start="414.74" dur="5.22">only question is when will the</text>
  <text start="416.48" dur="6.09">economists actually acknowledge it now</text>
  <text start="419.96" dur="4.86">Trump is a businessman he went to the</text>
  <text start="422.57" dur="5.31">Wharton School of Business and we know</text>
  <text start="424.82" dur="4.38">from his tweets before he was president</text>
  <text start="427.88" dur="2.88">he was talking about how the stock</text>
  <text start="429.2" dur="2.37">market was in a bubble how things were</text>
  <text start="430.76" dur="3.6">manipulated</text>
  <text start="431.57" dur="5.49">that we needed to bring back gold how</text>
  <text start="434.36" dur="5.55">fed the Fed was printing way too much</text>
  <text start="437.06" dur="8.07">currency that the Fed needs to be dealt</text>
  <text start="439.91" dur="7.32">with he knows what they were up to he</text>
  <text start="445.13" dur="4.02">got into office and he could have said</text>
  <text start="447.23" dur="5.88">hey listen let&amp;#39;s just tell the truth</text>
  <text start="449.15" dur="5.4">that the economy is fake well if he did</text>
  <text start="453.11" dur="4.23">that we would seek complete and utter</text>
  <text start="454.55" dur="7.08">chaos it would not benefit what he</text>
  <text start="457.34" dur="6.93">wanted to do he wanted to reverse</text>
  <text start="461.63" dur="5.28">everything the globalist lelee the</text>
  <text start="464.27" dur="6.48">central bankers were doing so he had to</text>
  <text start="466.91" dur="6.6">use their weapons against them and this</text>
  <text start="470.75" dur="4.65">is exactly what he&amp;#39;s been doing this is</text>
  <text start="473.51" dur="3.84">why when the central bank if you noticed</text>
  <text start="475.4" dur="5.07">before he became president they started</text>
  <text start="477.35" dur="4.89">to raise the rates at that time and then</text>
  <text start="480.47" dur="3.75">when he became president they started to</text>
  <text start="482.24" dur="3.57">move a lot faster and raising the rates</text>
  <text start="484.22" dur="2.85">this is because they thought they had</text>
  <text start="485.81" dur="2.97">the control they thought they had the</text>
  <text start="487.07" dur="3.54">narrative if you look at the mainstream</text>
  <text start="488.78" dur="4.35">media today they&amp;#39;re all reporting the</text>
  <text start="490.61" dur="5.01">same thing they know the exact date when</text>
  <text start="493.13" dur="4.65">the recessions gonna hit that 2020 but</text>
  <text start="495.62" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;ve been in a recession it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="497.78" dur="5.46">statistical numbers that have been you</text>
  <text start="500.45" dur="6.45">know letting us see a different picture</text>
  <text start="503.24" dur="5.82">which is the illusion Trump knows all</text>
  <text start="506.9" dur="3.51">this and what he&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="509.06" dur="5.43">was he&amp;#39;s turned everything around</text>
  <text start="510.41" dur="5.939">remember he&amp;#39;s dismantling everything</text>
  <text start="514.49" dur="2.67">right now can he do it all at once and</text>
  <text start="516.349" dur="3.331">just say hey I&amp;#39;m gonna dismantle</text>
  <text start="517.16" dur="5.1">everything no he&amp;#39;s taking one piece at a</text>
  <text start="519.68" dur="4.08">time started off as a Sunni came into</text>
  <text start="522.26" dur="5.64">office it did the easiest thing possible</text>
  <text start="523.76" dur="6.18">said yeah TPP dead he wanted to get rid</text>
  <text start="527.9" dur="4.08">of NAFTA but that was tied up in</text>
  <text start="529.94" dur="4.56">Congress and it was a complete nightmare</text>
  <text start="531.98" dur="5.37">the way they designed it so I had it</text>
  <text start="534.5" dur="5.43">been renegotiated and we can see that he</text>
  <text start="537.35" dur="5.4">pulled out of the Paris climate deal he</text>
  <text start="539.93" dur="5.85">also decided to speak out about</text>
  <text start="542.75" dur="5.52">globalism he started to make bilateral</text>
  <text start="545.78" dur="5.79">trade agreements he went against the</text>
  <text start="548.27" dur="5.4">World Trade Organization and we see that</text>
  <text start="551.57" dur="4.32">the individual that was in the World</text>
  <text start="553.67" dur="6.66">Bank that individual stepped down three</text>
  <text start="555.89" dur="7.11">years before he was supposed to so</text>
  <text start="560.33" dur="4.74">what&amp;#39;s happening right now the central</text>
  <text start="563" dur="3.33">bank was on a path</text>
  <text start="565.07" dur="3.39">and they couldn&amp;#39;t get out of it because</text>
  <text start="566.33" dur="4.92">their mission was completely different</text>
  <text start="568.46" dur="5.16">than what it is right now their mission</text>
  <text start="571.25" dur="5.01">was to bring down the economy blame it</text>
  <text start="573.62" dur="5.34">on Trump Trump put Powell on to power in</text>
  <text start="576.26" dur="4.02">the Fed and their mission has changed a</text>
  <text start="578.96" dur="3.03">little bit but the bad guys behind the</text>
  <text start="580.28" dur="5.28">scenes they still believe it&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="581.99" dur="6.54">exact mission which it is not now we</text>
  <text start="585.56" dur="3.57">need to remember that all of this is</text>
  <text start="588.53" dur="5.46">happening</text>
  <text start="589.13" dur="9.87">at once and the global economic system</text>
  <text start="593.99" dur="6.87">is crashing behind the scenes and when</text>
  <text start="599" dur="4.14">we look at the shutdown which we</text>
  <text start="600.86" dur="3.15">discussed yesterday we can see the</text>
  <text start="603.14" dur="5.76">shutdowns</text>
  <text start="604.01" dur="9.51">even differ from other presidents now</text>
  <text start="608.9" dur="7.8">this shutdown that Trump is handling</text>
  <text start="613.52" dur="7.92">right now is completely different than</text>
  <text start="616.7" dur="7.5">Obama&amp;#39;s back in 2013 the marching orders</text>
  <text start="621.44" dur="4.92">in the last administration those</text>
  <text start="624.2" dur="4.74">marching orders were to weaponize the</text>
  <text start="626.36" dur="8.85">shutdown to make it as painful as</text>
  <text start="628.94" dur="8.52">possible what did they do well they were</text>
  <text start="635.21" dur="4.65">told not to keep programs from running</text>
  <text start="637.46" dur="4.95">not to keep services running not to have</text>
  <text start="639.86" dur="4.95">federal workers delivering services as a</text>
  <text start="642.41" dur="4.56">policy matter and as a planned a</text>
  <text start="644.81" dur="4.65">political matter one example the</text>
  <text start="646.97" dur="4.17">differences in action is this year the</text>
  <text start="649.46" dur="3.51">Internal Revenue Service will be able to</text>
  <text start="651.14" dur="4.62">for the first time issue tax refunds</text>
  <text start="652.97" dur="4.41">during the shutdown the senior</text>
  <text start="655.76" dur="4.08">administrative official noted that the</text>
  <text start="657.38" dur="4.71">agencies are also implementing vault</text>
  <text start="659.84" dur="5.9">directive to make the shutdown as</text>
  <text start="662.09" dur="7.5">painless as possible right now</text>
  <text start="665.74" dur="6.79">IRS right now is going to verify</text>
  <text start="669.59" dur="6.63">mortgage applications Wylder while we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="672.53" dur="5.97">in a shutdown what they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="676.22" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re giving guidance to the agencies</text>
  <text start="678.5" dur="5.12">about how to look at things and how to</text>
  <text start="681.47" dur="6.29">find money to keep everything</text>
  <text start="683.62" dur="7.69">operational and this is coming from an</text>
  <text start="687.76" dur="6.1">individual in government the Department</text>
  <text start="691.31" dur="4.08">of the Treasury determined that even</text>
