  <text start="240.43" dur="5.669">the trumps administration contention</text>

  <text start="267.85" dur="5.36">trafficking and all this in the wall and</text>
  <text start="269.68" dur="6.03">putting up guards which stop all of this</text>
  <text start="273.21" dur="5.05">Judicial Watch began investigating this</text>
  <text start="275.71" dur="5.429">matter in 2014 when a wave of</text>
  <text start="278.26" dur="5.46">unaccompanied alien children swamped the</text>
  <text start="281.139" dur="5.431">southwest border at that time the</text>

  <text start="293.41" dur="5.34">investigation judicial want to learn</text>
  <text start="295.66" dur="6.09">that the be CFS was providing consumer</text>

  <text start="301.75" dur="3">children</text>
  <text start="302.32" dur="4.409">since that time Judicial Watch has been</text>
  <text start="304.75" dur="3.99">investigating incidents of violence drug</text>
  <text start="306.729" dur="5">trafficking human trafficking and other</text>
  <text start="308.74" dur="5.31">criminal activities as well as whether</text>
  <text start="311.729" dur="5.231">innocent children were being abused</text>
  <text start="314.05" dur="5.31">while in the u.s. shelter so under that</text>
  <text start="316.96" dur="4.07">period of time there was a huge</text>
  <text start="319.36" dur="3.779">of trouble but the corporate media</text>
  <text start="321.03" dur="4.9">reported on none of this and this is</text>
  <text start="323.139" dur="4.411">when everyone from Central America they</text>
  <text start="325.93" dur="4.38">were told or South America told they</text>
  <text start="327.55" dur="5.31">were told to come up through Mexico a</text>
  <text start="330.31" dur="4.409">lot of them rode the beast train to come</text>
  <text start="332.86" dur="4.019">into the US and if they jumped over the</text>
  <text start="334.719" dur="3.991">border they were then put on buses and</text>
  <text start="336.879" dur="3.111">brought to many different areas but</text>
  <text start="338.71" dur="3.179">there were so many of these individuals</text>
  <text start="339.99" dur="3.399">they couldn&amp;#39;t keep up and then they</text>
  <text start="341.889" dur="3.96">started funding different sanctuary</text>
  <text start="343.389" dur="4.56">cities and things like that we see Tom</text>
  <text start="345.849" dur="4.891">Fenton was at the trial with general</text>
  <text start="347.949" dur="4.56">Flynn and he tweeted out I attended</text>
  <text start="350.74" dur="4.019">general Flynn&amp;#39;s hearing today before</text>
  <text start="352.509" dur="4.921">judge Sullivan came away with the</text>
  <text start="354.759" dur="4.71">impression judge Sullivan would brook no</text>
  <text start="357.43" dur="4.38">more significant delays by Mueller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="359.469" dur="4.32">team of general Flynn sentencing saying</text>
  <text start="361.81" dur="6.329">that there are no more delays</text>
  <text start="363.789" dur="6.78">there&amp;#39;s nothing and Muller needs to move</text>
  <text start="368.139" dur="4.5">forward with this and again Muller</text>
  <text start="370.569" dur="4.291">really doesn&amp;#39;t have anything on this and</text>
  <text start="372.639" dur="4.231">this is why Muller has been delaying and</text>
  <text start="374.86" dur="3.66">now he&amp;#39;s forced to move forward and</text>
  <text start="376.87" dur="4.62">we&amp;#39;ll have to see where this goes and</text>
  <text start="378.52" dur="4.44">again we go back to Q where where Q is</text>
  <text start="381.49" dur="5.91">saying that Flynn is gonna be getting</text>
  <text start="382.96" dur="7.44">off very soon now we just talked about</text>
  <text start="387.4" dur="5.85">how the Beast train was bringing all</text>
  <text start="390.4" dur="4.5">these individuals up to the US and it</text>
  <text start="393.25" dur="3.419">was a lot of children because what the</text>
  <text start="394.9" dur="4.229">plan was it was to bring these children</text>
  <text start="396.669" dur="4.231">over a lot of whom were teenagers a lot</text>
  <text start="399.129" dur="3.981">of more in their 20s and then they could</text>
  <text start="400.9" dur="4.979">have the family come over afterwards and</text>
  <text start="403.11" dur="5.44">of course everyone was saying you know</text>
  <text start="405.879" dur="5.19">oh everyone should allow the illegals to</text>
  <text start="408.55" dur="4.459">come in this is America no this is</text>
  <text start="411.069" dur="5.19">America and there&amp;#39;s no problem with</text>
  <text start="413.009" dur="6.87">immigrants coming into the US if they go</text>
  <text start="416.259" dur="5.63">to if they follow the proper procedures</text>
  <text start="419.879" dur="6.13">jumping over the border</text>
  <text start="421.889" dur="7.601">well that&amp;#39;s illegal and you have to be</text>
  <text start="426.009" dur="3.96">vetted and we need to find out who you</text>
  <text start="429.49" dur="3.12">are</text>
  <text start="429.969" dur="5.551">are these your children aren&amp;#39;t that your</text>
  <text start="432.61" dur="5.1">children are you a criminal I mean why</text>
  <text start="435.52" dur="5.31">would we want to let rapists human</text>
  <text start="437.71" dur="5.069">traffickers drug runners into this</text>
  <text start="440.83" dur="4.259">country this is why they need to go to</text>
  <text start="442.779" dur="4.051">the checkpoints they needed to be vetted</text>
  <text start="445.089" dur="3.33">they also had to prove that these were</text>
  <text start="446.83" dur="3.72">their children that they weren&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="448.419" dur="4.681">know trafficking these children into the</text>
  <text start="450.55" dur="5.1">United States but of course</text>
  <text start="453.1" dur="6.72">Obama they didn&amp;#39;t want to do any of that</text>
  <text start="455.65" dur="5.67">and they weren&amp;#39;t doing it now a lot of</text>
  <text start="459.82" dur="4.08">things have changed because Trump has</text>
  <text start="461.32" dur="6.87">been pushing the wall he set up border</text>
  <text start="463.9" dur="7.65">security and now the New Mexican</text>
  <text start="468.19" dur="6.39">president-elect intends to create a new</text>
  <text start="471.55" dur="5.67">border police force to fight illegal</text>
  <text start="474.58" dur="4.89">immigration drug trafficking and illicit</text>
  <text start="477.22" dur="5.88">firearms trafficking from Central</text>
  <text start="479.47" dur="6.86">America so basically what this new</text>
  <text start="483.1" dur="9">president in Mexico is doing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="486.33" dur="8.77">building a wall of border police to stop</text>
  <text start="492.1" dur="6.45">all these individuals coming through</text>
  <text start="495.1" dur="6.48">Mexico very interesting because what</text>
  <text start="498.55" dur="6.69">they&amp;#39;ve seen was that drug violence has</text>
  <text start="501.58" dur="5.7">gone up to record highs and they want to</text>
  <text start="505.24" dur="4.34">shut all of this down now if they do</text>
  <text start="507.28" dur="5.4">this in this on their southern border</text>
  <text start="509.58" dur="5.709">this will stop the illegals coming</text>
  <text start="512.68" dur="5.489">through Mexico on the beast&amp;#39; train and</text>
  <text start="515.289" dur="7.081">we will see the number of illegals</text>
  <text start="518.169" dur="5.821">dwindle before Mexico was just and the</text>
  <text start="522.37" dur="3.27">previous president was just allowing all</text>
  <text start="523.99" dur="4.14">of them just to come right out come</text>
  <text start="525.64" dur="6">right on up now they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="528.13" dur="8.25">stopping them all so everything is about</text>
  <text start="531.64" dur="7.05">to change in regards to illegals coming</text>
  <text start="536.38" dur="6.72">through Mexico into the United States</text>
  <text start="538.69" dur="7.71">and again all the human trafficking all</text>
  <text start="543.1" dur="6">the drug running the gangs they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="546.4" dur="4.14">going to be stopped down at the southern</text>
  <text start="549.1" dur="3.66">border yes they&amp;#39;re still individuals in</text>
  <text start="550.54" dur="5.7">Mexico but this is going to dwindle</text>
  <text start="552.76" dur="6.15">quite a bit if this new president does</text>
  <text start="556.24" dur="5.94">what he says he&amp;#39;s going to do out in</text>
  <text start="558.91" dur="6.12">South Korea we see that they have</text>
  <text start="562.18" dur="4.74">suspended its summertime&amp;#39;s civil defense</text>
  <text start="565.03" dur="4.59">drills aimed at preparing against a</text>
  <text start="566.92" dur="6.57">North Korean attack and it looks like</text>
  <text start="569.62" dur="6.72">they&amp;#39;re doing this because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="573.49" dur="5.07">talking peace and they figured if we</text>
  <text start="576.34" dur="5.13">have this summertime civil defense drill</text>
  <text start="578.56" dur="4.98">it might not look good with North Korea</text>
  <text start="581.47" dur="4.41">so they have suspended it just like they</text>
  <text start="583.54" dur="3.22">suspended all the other drills the</text>
  <text start="585.88" dur="4.54">wartime drill</text>
  <text start="586.76" dur="6.87">with the us now the u.s. is out there</text>
  <text start="590.42" dur="5.58">and they&amp;#39;re pledging to keep the Hormuz</text>
  <text start="593.63" dur="5.31">Strait open despite what Iran is saying</text>
  <text start="596" dur="5.37">now yesterday we showed that under the</text>
  <text start="598.94" dur="4.62">resolution from the UN and that these</text>
  <text start="601.37" dur="4.35">are international waters Iran really</text>
  <text start="603.56" dur="5.46">can&amp;#39;t close down the Strait of Hormuz</text>
  <text start="605.72" dur="4.47">they just can&amp;#39;t do it and the u.s.</text>
  <text start="609.02" dur="3.54">saying that they&amp;#39;re gonna keep it open</text>
  <text start="610.19" dur="5.37">this is just a lot of talk right now</text>
  <text start="612.56" dur="5.4">because they know they can&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="615.56" dur="4.38">close it down because the people have</text>
  <text start="617.96" dur="3.48">the right of passage they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="619.94" dur="4.62">to shut it down because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="621.44" dur="6.39">international waters they don&amp;#39;t own that</text>
  <text start="624.56" dur="5.61">specific body of water up to a certain</text>
  <text start="627.83" dur="5.34">point but there&amp;#39;s like 50 kilometers</text>
  <text start="630.17" dur="4.95">that people are allowed to use or you</text>
  <text start="633.17" dur="4.31">know the different people to have</text>
  <text start="635.12" dur="4.77">passage through this area so right now</text>
  <text start="637.48" dur="4.78">the United States coming out saying this</text>
  <text start="639.89" dur="4.95">this is just about saying hey we won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="642.26" dur="5.19">let them do it well they can&amp;#39;t do it so</text>
  <text start="644.84" dur="6.15">this is kind of ridiculous we see right</text>
  <text start="647.45" dur="6.45">now that Syria they&amp;#39;ve liberated all</text>
  <text start="650.99" dur="5.52">border points south of Daraa right now</text>
  <text start="653.9" dur="5.82">and it looks like they control a lot of</text>
  <text start="656.51" dur="6">the Jordanian border and it is getting</text>
  <text start="659.72" dur="4.14">very very tough right now for the</text>
  <text start="662.51" dur="4.14">moderate rebels there surrounding like</text>
  <text start="663.86" dur="4.47">crazy even the Islamic state they are</text>
  <text start="666.65" dur="3.57">surrendering and if they don&amp;#39;t surrender</text>
  <text start="668.33" dur="3.24">the Syrian armed forces and Russian</text>
  <text start="670.22" dur="3.84">forces they just come in and they just</text>
  <text start="671.57" dur="4.38">wipe them out and the only chunk of the</text>
  <text start="674.06" dur="3.24">Jordanian Syrian border in the province</text>
  <text start="675.95" dur="3.63">of Deborah which remains in the hands of</text>

  <text start="679.58" dur="4.38">east of the israeli-occupied Golan</text>

  <text start="683.96" dur="6.78">Islamic state this is the paid mercenary</text>
  <text start="686.72" dur="6.48">army yes Israel supported them yes the</text>
  <text start="690.74" dur="4.62">coalition forces supported them the u.s.</text>
  <text start="693.2" dur="4.05">supported them now remember in each one</text>
  <text start="695.36" dur="5.52">of these countries there&amp;#39;s a deep state</text>
  <text start="697.25" dur="6.66">faction in these countries and they were</text>
  <text start="700.88" dur="5.13">supporting these forces but was very</text>
  <text start="703.91" dur="3.87">interesting and we know that Netanyahu&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="706.01" dur="3.38">going to be meeting Putin we know that</text>
  <text start="707.78" dur="6.78">Trump is going to be meeting Putin</text>
  <text start="709.39" dur="7.63">Israel they have decided that they will</text>
  <text start="714.56" dur="5.93">not rule out re-establishing some ties</text>
  <text start="717.02" dur="7.28">with the Assad regime in the future now</text>
  <text start="720.49" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;ve always said Assad must go he</text>
  <text start="724.3" dur="4.62">crossed the red line we need to move in</text>
  <text start="726.67" dur="4.62">but I think what Israel is seeing and</text>
  <text start="728.92" dur="6.21">I&amp;#39;m talking about the deep state faction</text>
  <text start="731.29" dur="7.59">in Israel they&amp;#39;re seeing that there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="735.13" dur="6.12">hope here just like Makran said we might</text>
  <text start="738.88" dur="4.829">have to deal with Assad Assad can stay</text>
  <text start="741.25" dur="4.08">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see a lot of</text>
  <text start="743.709" dur="3">countries out there saying that Assad</text>
  <text start="745.33" dur="5.28">can stay because they have no choice</text>
  <text start="746.709" dur="7.641">right now now we understand that the US</text>
  <text start="750.61" dur="8.82">and Israel they want the Iranian forces</text>
  <text start="754.35" dur="7.239">to be out of Syria and I think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="759.43" dur="4.62">going to be an announcement and this</text>
  <text start="761.589" dur="4.141">announcement will be made after the</text>
  <text start="764.05" dur="3.93">meeting with Putin and I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="765.73" dur="5.4">playing this up quite a bit to let</text>
  <text start="767.98" dur="6.03">everyone know they we will back off if</text>
  <text start="771.13" dur="6.209">the Iranian forces leave Syria and</text>
  <text start="774.01" dur="5.82">basically as we know right now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="777.339" dur="4.351">advisors there there might be a couple</text>
  <text start="779.83" dur="4.08">of troops but it&amp;#39;s not what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="781.69" dur="5.07">talking about and I think they just want</text>
  <text start="783.91" dur="5.07">Iran out of this area right now and I</text>
  <text start="786.76" dur="4.199">think Putin already laid the groundwork</text>
  <text start="788.98" dur="3.99">by saying all foreign troops and that</text>
  <text start="790.959" dur="4.771">was concluding the Iranian troops must</text>
  <text start="792.97" dur="6.57">leave Syria and I think this is all</text>
  <text start="795.73" dur="5.82">about saving face at this point and we</text>
  <text start="799.54" dur="4.32">know that the deep state they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="801.55" dur="4.92">this to end and we know that coming out</text>
  <text start="803.86" dur="4.56">of different publications just like we</text>
  <text start="806.47" dur="3.51">saw out of South Korea and we know that</text>
  <text start="808.42" dur="4.26">the deep state owns many of these</text>
  <text start="809.98" dur="4.74">publications where they push a certain</text>
  <text start="812.68" dur="4.14">narrative well they&amp;#39;re pushing a</text>
  <text start="814.72" dur="3.78">narrative that Iran has already to</text>
  <text start="816.82" dur="3.6">attack Israel which is absolutely</text>
  <text start="818.5" dur="3.899">ridiculous they don&amp;#39;t have hundreds and</text>
  <text start="820.42" dur="3.81">hundreds of missiles in the southern</text>
  <text start="822.399" dur="3.121">part of Syria facing Israel getting</text>
  <text start="824.23" dur="1.849">ready to attack that&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="825.52" dur="3.75">ridiculous</text>
  <text start="826.079" dur="5.081">think about it why would Putin at this</text>
  <text start="829.27" dur="3.809">point where they spend a lot of money a</text>
  <text start="831.16" dur="6.33">lot of energy removing the terrorist</text>
  <text start="833.079" dur="8.01">groups why would they allow Iran in</text>
  <text start="837.49" dur="6.18">Syria to point missiles at Israel and</text>
  <text start="841.089" dur="4.051">actually attack Israel to start a war it</text>
  <text start="843.67" dur="4.44">would make no sense whatsoever</text>
  <text start="845.14" dur="4.439">you know that Putin has full control</text>
  <text start="848.11" dur="5.82">over this area and you really think</text>
  <text start="849.579" dur="7.801">Assad would want to have another war</text>
  <text start="853.93" dur="4.62">it makes no sense so whoever is putting</text>
  <text start="857.38" dur="3.72">this publication out whoever&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="858.55" dur="6">translating what is going on here is</text>
  <text start="861.1" dur="4.98">misleading the public to think that Iran</text>
  <text start="864.55" dur="3.36">is going to be attacking which is not</text>
  <text start="866.08" dur="4.199">going to happen at this point just like</text>
  <text start="867.91" dur="4.56">they did with North Korea where they</text>
  <text start="870.279" dur="4.081">said North Korea is going to attack the</text>
  <text start="872.47" dur="4.29">u.s. they&amp;#39;re gonna be firing a nuclear</text>
  <text start="874.36" dur="3.72">weapon it&amp;#39;s going to hit Chicago it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="876.76" dur="1.889">going to hit Alaska it&amp;#39;s going to hit</text>
  <text start="878.08" dur="3.27">everywhere</text>
  <text start="878.649" dur="5.551">and it was all fake phony and false even</text>
  <text start="881.35" dur="4.95">the South Korean newspaper the</text>
  <text start="884.2" dur="4.139">publication there they were saying that</text>
  <text start="886.3" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re going to be firing missiles into</text>
  <text start="888.339" dur="4.801">South Korea and it&amp;#39;s all fake and phony</text>
  <text start="891.07" dur="3.269">to make you think that something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="893.14" dur="3.569">happening when it&amp;#39;s really not now</text>
  <text start="894.339" dur="5.701">something does happen this is the deep</text>
  <text start="896.709" dur="5.731">state pushing a false flag but I think</text>
  <text start="900.04" dur="4.56">what&amp;#39;s happening right now is they know</text>
  <text start="902.44" dur="4.08">time is running out they know that the</text>
  <text start="904.6" dur="4.049">troops have to be moved out of this area</text>
  <text start="906.52" dur="3.72">after the Putin meeting I think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="908.649" dur="2.461">gonna see a lot of things change I think</text>
