  <text start="88.05" dur="6.429">guess what nobody wants this but look</text>
  <text start="92.08" dur="5.099">how these central bankers these</text>
  <text start="94.479" dur="5.67">corporations look how they continually</text>
  <text start="97.179" dur="5.011">push and push and push until they get</text>
  <text start="100.149" dur="5.61">their way and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="102.19" dur="7.89">right now here in the United States we</text>
  <text start="105.759" dur="6.661">have Obamacare and we talked a lot about</text>
  <text start="110.08" dur="3.84">Obamacare and what&amp;#39;s very interesting as</text>
  <text start="112.42" dur="3.18">Obamacare right now is a complete</text>
  <text start="113.92" dur="4.43">disaster I mean we went over this many</text>
  <text start="115.6" dur="6.65">many times but the architect of</text>
  <text start="118.35" dur="7.57">Obamacare MIT economics professor</text>
  <text start="122.25" dur="7">Jonathan Gruber he&amp;#39;s arguing that the</text>
  <text start="125.92" dur="5.34">law is working as designed those</text>
  <text start="129.25" dur="5.16">individuals that could never have health</text>
  <text start="131.26" dur="4.53">insurance who get subsidies now they</text>
  <text start="134.41" dur="5.46">have health insurance they don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="135.79" dur="7.039">lay out hardly any money and the reason</text>
  <text start="139.87" dur="7.53">why they&amp;#39;re having a problem is because</text>
  <text start="142.829" dur="8.291">the penalties are too small yes you</text>
  <text start="147.4" dur="8.28">heard that right the penalties are too</text>
  <text start="151.12" dur="7.709">small and they must be made larger now</text>
  <text start="155.68" dur="6.33">think about this for a second this was</text>
  <text start="158.829" dur="6.061">supposed to be a benefit to the people</text>
  <text start="162.01" dur="5.49">of the United States where everybody can</text>
  <text start="164.89" dur="5.73">get health insurance supposed to be</text>
  <text start="167.5" dur="7.17">affordable supposed to give you great</text>
  <text start="170.62" dur="6.69">benefits and they placed a penalty on</text>
  <text start="174.67" dur="4.649">and we know why they did this because</text>
  <text start="177.31" dur="2.97">otherwise the insurance companies</text>
  <text start="179.319" dur="1.651">wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to make money because</text>
  <text start="180.28" dur="2.1">people</text>
  <text start="180.97" dur="4.89">wouldn&amp;#39;t join up if people didn&amp;#39;t join</text>
  <text start="182.38" dur="6.3">up and apply for the health insurance</text>
  <text start="185.86" dur="5.58">the insurance companies well their</text>
  <text start="188.68" dur="5.91">profits would decline and they would not</text>
  <text start="191.44" dur="4.62">be able to do this scam so they created</text>
  <text start="194.59" dur="3.93">these penalties thinking that if you</text>
  <text start="196.06" dur="6.51">just heard the word penalty or another</text>
  <text start="198.52" dur="6.33">tax you would automatically elect the</text>
  <text start="202.57" dur="4.74">insurance but people started to figure</text>
  <text start="204.85" dur="5.28">out well wait a minute the benefit to me</text>
  <text start="207.31" dur="6.63">is not that great and think about this</text>
  <text start="210.13" dur="6.57">also Congress exempted themselves Obama</text>
  <text start="213.94" dur="5.37">really doesn&amp;#39;t have Obamacare if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="216.7" dur="4.49">that great our fearless leaders who call</text>
  <text start="219.31" dur="4.35">themselves leaders which they are not</text>
  <text start="221.19" dur="7.269">they do they should have been in the for</text>
  <text start="223.66" dur="7.02">right out front showing everyone how</text>
  <text start="228.459" dur="4.311">great it is by taking it and keeping it</text>
  <text start="230.68" dur="5.58">and using it but they didn&amp;#39;t do that</text>
  <text start="232.77" dur="5.74">actually for the staffers in Congress</text>
  <text start="236.26" dur="4.59">Obama said oh whoa this is too expensive</text>
  <text start="238.51" dur="6.84">for you guys all right then we&amp;#39;ll waive</text>
  <text start="240.85" dur="6.84">you you don&amp;#39;t have to get it but think</text>
  <text start="245.35" dur="5.669">about this for a second they created a</text>
  <text start="247.69" dur="7.079">penalty to get everyone into the</text>
  <text start="251.019" dur="6.061">insurance arena it didn&amp;#39;t work and now</text>
  <text start="254.769" dur="4.831">they&amp;#39;re having a problem so now we have</text>
  <text start="257.08" dur="4.85">Jonathan Gruber out there saying listen</text>
  <text start="259.6" dur="4.56">this is the only problem we have is that</text>
  <text start="261.93" dur="3.67">we didn&amp;#39;t have something to push people</text>
  <text start="264.16" dur="4.98">into the insurance market we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="265.6" dur="5.85">penalize them enough well if it was so</text>
  <text start="269.14" dur="5.25">great and such a benefit and it was</text>
  <text start="271.45" dur="5.07">affordable you wouldn&amp;#39;t have to put a</text>
  <text start="274.39" dur="5.25">penalty on there the only reason you</text>
  <text start="276.52" dur="5.52">penalize people and force them into</text>
  <text start="279.64" dur="9.68">doing something they don&amp;#39;t want to do is</text>
  <text start="282.04" dur="12.75">because they know it sucks that&amp;#39;s it and</text>
  <text start="289.32" dur="7.42">Obamacare is awful and the only reason</text>
  <text start="294.79" dur="4.439">they have anyone in Obamacare is because</text>
  <text start="296.74" dur="4.47">you have one hand those people receiving</text>
  <text start="299.229" dur="3.061">the subsidies and the other hand those</text>
  <text start="301.21" dur="3.57">people who had their health insurance</text>
  <text start="302.29" dur="4.5">they lost their health insurance so they</text>
  <text start="304.78" dur="4.199">had to go and find health insurance and</text>
  <text start="306.79" dur="4.02">where is their to go Obamacare that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="308.979" dur="4.941">the rest of the people in the country</text>
  <text start="310.81" dur="6.65">said I just can&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="313.92" dur="5.22">word it this is why no one is signing up</text>
  <text start="317.46" dur="4.92">and even those people that are signing</text>
  <text start="319.14" dur="7.41">up they&amp;#39;re dropping out it&amp;#39;s a complete</text>
  <text start="322.38" dur="8.88">disaster it was a scam on the American</text>
  <text start="326.55" dur="10.17">people now a couple of days ago the</text>
  <text start="331.26" dur="8.25">Pentagon was asking veterans to repay</text>
  <text start="336.72" dur="10.53">the salary or the bonuses they received</text>
  <text start="339.51" dur="10.29">and this has created an uproar among the</text>
  <text start="347.25" dur="4.47">public in the United States saying this</text>
  <text start="349.8" dur="3.81">is ridiculous and of course the veterans</text>
  <text start="351.72" dur="5.7">are saying this is absolutely ridiculous</text>
  <text start="353.61" dur="7.14">we have to repay the money and we have</text>
  <text start="357.42" dur="5.16">to go back in time here because surely</text>
  <text start="360.75" dur="3.68">after the US invasion of Iraq the</text>
  <text start="362.58" dur="6.6">Pentagon hired bail</text>
  <text start="364.43" dur="7.66">Pottinger a london-based PR agency the</text>
  <text start="369.18" dur="5.43">PR firm was tasked with promoting what</text>
  <text start="372.09" dur="5.82">the pendant Pentagon called democratic</text>
  <text start="374.61" dur="5.82">elections in Iraq ultimately earning</text>
  <text start="377.91" dur="4.98">over a hundred million dollars yearly</text>
  <text start="380.43" dur="4.92">part of the firm&amp;#39;s jobs included</text>
  <text start="382.89" dur="5.07">producing fake al Qaeda propaganda firm</text>
  <text start="385.35" dur="4.38">films the Bureau of Investigative</text>
  <text start="387.96" dur="3.83">Journalism recently reported this and</text>
  <text start="389.73" dur="5.01">the Pentagon seemed to have no issue</text>
  <text start="391.79" dur="5.89">allocating taxpayer resources to have</text>
  <text start="394.74" dur="4.89">these videos produced and they spent a</text>
  <text start="397.68" dur="6.27">lot of money on these millions and</text>
  <text start="399.63" dur="7.35">millions of dollars over ten years after</text>
  <text start="403.95" dur="5.87">the Iraq invasion the Pentagon is now</text>
  <text start="406.98" dur="6.33">concerned about its past appropriations</text>
  <text start="409.82" dur="7.56">well at least part of them anyhow so</text>
  <text start="413.31" dur="12.12">soldiers back then who Rhian listed in</text>
  <text start="417.38" dur="13.81">2006 and 2007 were told that they will</text>
  <text start="425.43" dur="9.36">receive a bonus of fifteen thousand</text>
  <text start="431.19" dur="7.68">dollars if they re enlisted for a</text>
  <text start="434.79" dur="6.42">six-year reenlistment and remember these</text>
  <text start="438.87" dur="6.51">individuals are sacrificing their safety</text>
  <text start="441.21" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;re leaving their homes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="445.38" dur="7.5">going to fight for the United&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="447.72" dur="8.55">dates and the Pentagon right now wants</text>
  <text start="452.88" dur="6.45">their money back from them maybe they</text>
  <text start="456.27" dur="5.39">should be looking at where that ten</text>
  <text start="459.33" dur="5.52">trillion dollar is that Rumsfeld</text>
  <text start="461.66" dur="4.96">misplaced and I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="464.85" dur="3.27">more than that that they cannot find</text>
  <text start="466.62" dur="3.45">because we&amp;#39;ve been hearing a lot of</text>
  <text start="468.12" dur="5.15">reports that there are trillions of</text>
  <text start="470.07" dur="7.59">dollars just gone out of the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="473.27" dur="7.71">and the people looked at this and said</text>
  <text start="477.66" dur="8.61">well wait a minute are you kidding me</text>
  <text start="480.98" dur="7.78">these people went out and fought for the</text>
  <text start="486.27" dur="4.08">United States now I know people are</text>
  <text start="488.76" dur="3.78">saying well it was for the central</text>
  <text start="490.35" dur="5.85">bankers but in their minds they were</text>
  <text start="492.54" dur="6.39">fighting for freedom democracy for the</text>
  <text start="496.2" dur="6.45">United States they were giving up their</text>
  <text start="498.93" dur="8">everyday lives sacrificing their lives</text>
  <text start="502.65" dur="8.31">leaving their families their homes and</text>
  <text start="506.93" dur="8.289">maybe not even see their children they</text>
  <text start="510.96" dur="7.949">were doing all of this for the country</text>
  <text start="515.219" dur="8.13">and they were promised a certain amount</text>
  <text start="518.909" dur="7.381">of money and believe me to go out and</text>
  <text start="523.349" dur="4.321">fight like this for $15,000 that&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="526.29" dur="3.51">lot of money think about what these</text>
  <text start="527.67" dur="6.6">politicians are getting to sit behind a</text>
  <text start="529.8" dur="7.53">desk and to become corrupt and to not</text>
  <text start="534.27" dur="4.86">care about the people and to work for</text>
  <text start="537.33" dur="4.38">the corporations for foreign governments</text>
  <text start="539.13" dur="7.56">for central banks so this is not even a</text>
  <text start="541.71" dur="8.79">lot and after this lie that has been</text>
  <text start="546.69" dur="5.13">exposed to the public it appears two</text>
  <text start="550.5" dur="3.12">weeks before the election that the</text>
  <text start="551.82" dur="4.5">Pentagon has backed off its demands for</text>
  <text start="553.62" dur="4.83">repayment of the re-enlistment bonuses</text>
  <text start="556.32" dur="5.25">from tens of thousands of California</text>
  <text start="558.45" dur="5.7">National Guardsmen well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="561.57" dur="5.1">absolutely right they should not be</text>
  <text start="564.15" dur="6.09">asking these individuals for the money</text>
  <text start="566.67" dur="5.61">back because they decided that they were</text>
  <text start="570.24" dur="4.14">going to allocate this money no matter</text>
  <text start="572.28" dur="4.83">how it got to them they were not</text>
  <text start="574.38" dur="5.43">responsible what they received they were</text>
  <text start="577.11" dur="4.349">promised it they received it maybe the</text>
  <text start="579.81" dur="3.54">Pentagon needs to go and look</text>
  <text start="581.459" dur="4.56">for the trillions of dollars that is</text>
  <text start="583.35" dur="4.049">missing maybe they can ask that firm for</text>
  <text start="586.019" dur="5.67">the money back where they were creating</text>
  <text start="587.399" dur="7.711">fake al Qaeda propaganda films maybe</text>
  <text start="591.689" dur="8.101">that&amp;#39;s where they can go but again you</text>
  <text start="595.11" dur="8.279">can see how these politicians how the US</text>
  <text start="599.79" dur="7.739">government really treats our veterans</text>
  <text start="603.389" dur="7.74">and our veterans they are the lifeblood</text>
  <text start="607.529" dur="8.581">of this country they make huge</text>
  <text start="611.129" dur="9.87">sacrifices to go out there and to stand</text>
  <text start="616.11" dur="9.99">up and to fight different armies</text>
  <text start="620.999" dur="7.26">different individuals now I know people</text>
  <text start="626.1" dur="4.289">are gonna say well these wars aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="628.259" dur="4.95">real but remember many of these people</text>
  <text start="630.389" dur="5.07">they don&amp;#39;t know this they do believe</text>
  <text start="633.209" dur="4.86">that they&amp;#39;re going out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="635.459" dur="4.98">fighting for our country they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="638.069" dur="5.401">realize what is happening with the</text>
  <text start="640.439" dur="5.221">central bank with corrupt politicians</text>
  <text start="643.47" dur="3.57">they know a little maybe but we have to</text>
  <text start="645.66" dur="3.959">remember a lot of the Armed Forces they</text>
  <text start="647.04" dur="4.56">block all this information they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="649.619" dur="5.45">let them see alternative media they</text>
  <text start="651.6" dur="7.049">don&amp;#39;t let them see other things and</text>
  <text start="655.069" dur="7.2">these individuals should get the same</text>
  <text start="658.649" dur="8.011">benefits as those people in Congress</text>
  <text start="662.269" dur="6.43">those people that are working in the</text>
  <text start="666.66" dur="3.69">government because if you really look at</text>
  <text start="668.699" dur="4.461">what they have they have incredible</text>
  <text start="670.35" dur="5.659">pensions they have credible insurance</text>
  <text start="673.16" dur="5.789">they have incredible everything and</text>
  <text start="676.009" dur="6.52">they&amp;#39;re the ones destroying the country</text>
  <text start="678.949" dur="6.37">actually it should be the opposite the</text>
  <text start="682.529" dur="4.56">veterans should have the pensions the</text>
  <text start="685.319" dur="4.13">veterans should have the health</text>
  <text start="687.089" dur="5.1">insurance the veterans should have</text>
  <text start="689.449" dur="4.271">whatever these politicians have these</text>
  <text start="692.189" dur="3.87">politicians actually shouldn&amp;#39;t even have</text>
  <text start="693.72" dur="4.619">these things there&amp;#39;s no reason for it</text>
  <text start="696.059" dur="4.171">there&amp;#39;s no reason for them to have the</text>
  <text start="698.339" dur="5.22">best of the best and to live like kings</text>
  <text start="700.23" dur="6.24">and queens in Washington while our</text>
  <text start="703.559" dur="7.671">veterans are waiting to be seen by a</text>
  <text start="706.47" dur="6.51">doctor where our veterans come back with</text>
  <text start="711.23" dur="4.03">problems</text>
  <text start="712.98" dur="3.99">and we can see right now this is</text>
  <text start="715.26" dur="5.16">something that needs to be completely</text>
  <text start="716.97" dur="5.13">changed in America now in the past</text>
  <text start="720.42" dur="4.95">couple of months we have been seeing</text>
  <text start="722.1" dur="4.89">North Korea they&amp;#39;ve been test firing</text>
  <text start="725.37" dur="2.85">their missile systems and the United</text>
  <text start="726.99" dur="3.24">States government central bankers in</text>
  <text start="728.22" dur="3.39">South Korea they&amp;#39;re making a very big</text>
  <text start="730.23" dur="2.94">deal about this and of course this is</text>
  <text start="731.61" dur="4.62">attached to many different agendas</text>
  <text start="733.17" dur="5.25">one of them to up military budget bring</text>
  <text start="736.23" dur="5.01">in the fed missile system bring in the</text>
  <text start="738.42" dur="5.43">tank inventory into South Korea and</text>
  <text start="741.24" dur="4.32">prepare and prepare for the next war and</text>
  <text start="743.85" dur="3.69">we can see right now the United States</text>
  <text start="745.56" dur="3.87">government central bankers they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="747.54" dur="3.299">like countries that have nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="749.43" dur="3.709">because first of all it makes it very</text>
  <text start="750.839" dur="4.44">difficult to invade a country</text>
  <text start="753.139" dur="4.931">second of all makes it very difficult to</text>
  <text start="755.279" dur="4.591">have regime change and you can see with</text>
  <text start="758.07" dur="3.69">most of the countries that they&amp;#39;ve gone</text>
  <text start="759.87" dur="3.69">into it&amp;#39;s those countries that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="761.76" dur="6.21">have nuclear weapons where they&amp;#39;re able</text>
  <text start="763.56" dur="6.36">to have regime change or invade and we</text>
  <text start="767.97" dur="3.21">see right now that everything the United</text>
  <text start="769.92" dur="3.99">States government central bankers have</text>
  <text start="771.18" dur="5.399">been doing is not working where they are</text>
  <text start="773.91" dur="6.419">placing sanctions and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="776.579" dur="5.791">control North Korea and North Korea is</text>
  <text start="780.329" dur="4.981">going to continually to try to develop</text>
  <text start="782.37" dur="4.35">nuclear weapons are they going to use it</text>
  <text start="785.31" dur="5.79">out in the United States out of the blue</text>
  <text start="786.72" dur="7.229">no this is propaganda this is what the</text>
  <text start="791.1" dur="5.669">United States uses to move military</text>
  <text start="793.949" dur="5.851">assets around the world to up military</text>
  <text start="796.769" dur="4.291">budgets and we see James clapper the</text>
  <text start="799.8" dur="5.279">head of the US Defense Intelligence</text>
  <text start="801.06" dur="6.12">Agency said that the notion of getting</text>
  <text start="805.079" dur="4.171">the North Koreans to denuclearize is</text>
  <text start="807.18" dur="4.92">probably a lost cause at this point</text>
  <text start="809.25" dur="5.3">which absolutely actually I do agree</text>
  <text start="812.1" dur="6.479">with him it is a lost cause because</text>
  <text start="814.55" dur="5.56">sanctions don&amp;#39;t work I mean Obama said</text>
  <text start="818.579" dur="3.601">it but he continually places sanctions</text>
  <text start="820.11" dur="5.76">on all different countries like Russia</text>
  <text start="822.18" dur="4.98">Syria but he tells us that sanctions</text>
  <text start="825.87" dur="4.649">don&amp;#39;t work and we have to remove them</text>
  <text start="827.16" dur="5.789">from Cuba so we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="830.519" dur="3.961">sanctions really don&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="832.949" dur="4.711">actually they make the problem even</text>
  <text start="834.48" dur="5.37">worse and every time you put pressure on</text>
  <text start="837.66" dur="4.919">a country they&amp;#39;re always going to do the</text>
  <text start="839.85" dur="4.62">opposite of what you want them to do and</text>
  <text start="842.579" dur="3.871">you can see right now that the United</text>
  <text start="844.47" dur="3.48">States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="846.45" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;ve been trying for many many years</text>
  <text start="847.95" dur="6.57">to make sure that they get North Korea</text>
  <text start="851.37" dur="5.46">and they&amp;#39;re trying to stop them from</text>
  <text start="854.52" dur="5.04">getting a nuclear weapon now they did</text>
  <text start="856.83" dur="7.26">this with Iran where they never wanted</text>
  <text start="859.56" dur="6.99">Iran to develop a nuclear weapon and we</text>
  <text start="864.09" dur="4.71">can see that the p5 plus 1 deal most</text>
  <text start="866.55" dur="4.05">likely had different agendas associated</text>
  <text start="868.8" dur="4.68">with it and think about this for a</text>
  <text start="870.6" dur="5.31">second one they were hoping that by</text>
  <text start="873.48" dur="4.95">doing this they can they would have the</text>
  <text start="875.91" dur="4.17">IMF come in regulate the central bank</text>
  <text start="878.43" dur="3.63">there and place the oil on the dollar to</text>
  <text start="880.08" dur="5.25">prop up the petro dollar system the</text>
  <text start="882.06" dur="6.09">other one is they are now sure by having</text>
  <text start="885.33" dur="5.55">all these inspections that Iran will not</text>
  <text start="888.15" dur="5.43">develop a nuclear weapon and like I said</text>
  <text start="890.88" dur="5.18">before it&amp;#39;s much easier to go into a</text>
  <text start="893.58" dur="4.58">country and invade a country without</text>
  <text start="896.06" dur="5.23">nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="898.16" dur="4.48">so you can see from what we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="901.29" dur="4.05">at here there were two agendas</text>
  <text start="902.64" dur="4.5">associated with this one trying to get</text>
  <text start="905.34" dur="4.32">the petro dollar propped up the other</text>
  <text start="907.14" dur="5.4">one if that didn&amp;#39;t work make sure they</text>
  <text start="909.66" dur="5.22">will not develop any type of nuclear</text>
  <text start="912.54" dur="3.69">weapon to make it easier later on to</text>
  <text start="914.88" dur="5.67">invade because we have to remember going</text>
  <text start="916.23" dur="6.45">back to General Wesley Clark where he</text>
  <text start="920.55" dur="5.19">listed all the different countries Syria</text>
  <text start="922.68" dur="5.6">and Iran were the last two countries the</text>
  <text start="925.74" dur="5.79">United States was going to go into and</text>
  <text start="928.28" dur="5.53">have regime change and they were going</text>
  <text start="931.53" dur="5.4">to set up a central bank put the oil on</text>
  <text start="933.81" dur="4.95">the dollar and here we are at Syria and</text>
  <text start="936.93" dur="6.3">it hasn&amp;#39;t gone any further than that</text>
  <text start="938.76" dur="7.11">and I believe the p5 plus one was to set</text>
  <text start="943.23" dur="6.33">this up so it would make it easier once</text>
  <text start="945.87" dur="7.35">they finished with Syria if Iran didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="949.56" dur="5.58">abide by what the US government central</text>
  <text start="953.22" dur="4.77">bankers wanted and that was to put the</text>
  <text start="955.14" dur="5.01">dollar on the oil now we understand that</text>
  <text start="957.99" dur="5.64">Russia is selling their battle group to</text>
  <text start="960.15" dur="6.36">the Mediterranean and at certain points</text>
  <text start="963.63" dur="5.37">they have to refuel and the Russian</text>
  <text start="966.51" dur="6.54">battle group they were making plans with</text>
  <text start="969" dur="8.67">Spain to refuel at Quetta and we can see</text>
  <text start="973.05" dur="7.26">right now NATO was furious with Spain</text>
  <text start="977.67" dur="9.24">and they didn&amp;#39;t want rush</text>
  <text start="980.31" dur="10.23">to dock their ships in this port and we</text>
  <text start="986.91" dur="8.34">can see right now that Russia has</text>
  <text start="990.54" dur="8.85">decided well we won&amp;#39;t do this we&amp;#39;ll keep</text>
  <text start="995.25" dur="6.72">going we&amp;#39;ll go past this area now Quetta</text>
  <text start="999.39" dur="4.04">sits on the tip of Africa&amp;#39;s northeast</text>
  <text start="1001.97" dur="3.69">across from the Straits of Gibraltar</text>
  <text start="1003.43" dur="5.59">from the mainland of Spain bordering</text>
  <text start="1005.66" dur="6.6">Morocco and we can see that Quetta is</text>
  <text start="1009.02" dur="5.64">part of the EU and its NATO status is</text>
  <text start="1012.26" dur="5.64">really unclear right now but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1014.66" dur="5.81">interesting since 2011 at least 60</text>
  <text start="1017.9" dur="5.07">Russian warships have docked there and</text>
  <text start="1020.47" dur="5.88">refueled and there was never a problem</text>
  <text start="1022.97" dur="6">and we can see right now that NATO is</text>
  <text start="1026.35" dur="5.77">using this propaganda because Jens</text>
  <text start="1028.97" dur="4.83">Stoltenberg he was out there warning on</text>
  <text start="1032.12" dur="4.469">Tuesday that the Russian warships</text>
  <text start="1033.8" dur="6.36">heading for Syria could be used to</text>
  <text start="1036.589" dur="4.201">target civilians which is absolutely</text>
  <text start="1040.16" dur="2.789">ridiculous</text>
  <text start="1040.79" dur="5.37">why would Russia bring their entire</text>
  <text start="1042.949" dur="6.241">battle group to target civilians they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1046.16" dur="6.05">going after the real terrorists they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1049.19" dur="6.69">trying to clean the country of terrorism</text>
  <text start="1052.21" dur="5.92">there be no purpose to hit civilians</text>
  <text start="1055.88" dur="5.76">because then the civilians would turn on</text>
  <text start="1058.13" dur="8.49">Russia and Syria it makes no sense that</text>
  <text start="1061.64" dur="8.49">is propaganda once again now Russia has</text>
  <text start="1066.62" dur="5.43">unveiled the first images of their</text>
  <text start="1070.13" dur="6.69">nuclear missile which is capable of</text>
  <text start="1072.05" dur="8.58">reaching US soil and it is a advanced</text>
  <text start="1076.82" dur="6.74">liquid fueled heavy ICBM capable of</text>
  <text start="1080.63" dur="7.41">evading anti-missile defenses and</text>
  <text start="1083.56" dur="7.63">hitting the US and this is one of the</text>
  <text start="1088.04" dur="7.11">first of its kind since I believe the</text>
  <text start="1091.19" dur="7.41">60s which is going to replace the r-36</text>
  <text start="1095.15" dur="6.36">family of Russian IC M ICBMs which</text>
  <text start="1098.6" dur="7.29">entered service during the Soviet period</text>
  <text start="1101.51" dur="10.05">and we can see that these new missile</text>
  <text start="1105.89" dur="8.34">systems they can bob weave and they can</text>
  <text start="1111.56" dur="4.02">do all these different things where the</text>
  <text start="1114.23" dur="3.39">missile shields that the United States</text>
  <text start="1115.58" dur="4.11">have set up because the United States</text>
  <text start="1117.62" dur="4.08">has changed their doctrine where they</text>
  <text start="1119.69" dur="3.81">can go after our first strike where they</text>
  <text start="1121.7" dur="3.99">believe they can win and then have the</text>
  <text start="1123.5" dur="5.73">missile shield protect the United States</text>
  <text start="1125.69" dur="6.239">from the launch of the nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="1129.23" dur="7.29">from Russia we know this is not going to</text>
  <text start="1131.929" dur="6.901">work because we can see the Russian</text>
  <text start="1136.52" dur="6.72">missile systems the Russian technology</text>
  <text start="1138.83" dur="6.65">that they have is working a lot better</text>
  <text start="1143.24" dur="5.37">than United States as technology and</text>
  <text start="1145.48" dur="5.38">it&amp;#39;s a little bit more advanced and we</text>
  <text start="1148.61" dur="4.62">can see right now the u.s. is a little</text>
  <text start="1150.86" dur="5.46">bit behind the curve on this and this is</text>
  <text start="1153.23" dur="5.37">why when they talk about war war is not</text>
  <text start="1156.32" dur="4.67">going to be good at all it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="1158.6" dur="6.99">absolutely awful because like I said</text>
  <text start="1160.99" dur="7.27">these countries today they have weapons</text>
  <text start="1165.59" dur="5.43">that will reach the United States this</text>
  <text start="1168.26" dur="7.19">war will not be fought in a far-off land</text>
  <text start="1171.02" dur="7.5">this war will be fought on our land and</text>
  <text start="1175.45" dur="7.93">believe me when it&amp;#39;s fought on our land</text>
  <text start="1178.52" dur="6.96">it is completely different and this is</text>
  <text start="1183.38" dur="4.56">why at the point where they say we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1185.48" dur="5.49">going to war even before that the entire</text>
  <text start="1187.94" dur="6.09">world needs to stand up and say we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1190.97" dur="5.04">not going along with this France is</text>
  <text start="1194.03" dur="7.26">going to extend their aircraft carrier</text>
  <text start="1196.01" dur="7.409">mission until December or so this is the</text>
  <text start="1201.29" dur="4.47">Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier and</text>
  <text start="1203.419" dur="5.161">we can see that the United States is</text>
  <text start="1205.76" dur="5.909">planning something much much larger in</text>
  <text start="1208.58" dur="5.16">this area the UK is going to deploy</text>
  <text start="1211.669" dur="3.961">tanks drones to Eastern Europe to boost</text>
  <text start="1213.74" dur="5.1">NATO presence they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="1215.63" dur="6.09">sending tactical drones challenger 2</text>
  <text start="1218.84" dur="6.11">tanks to Eastern Europe and we can see</text>
  <text start="1221.72" dur="7.17">right now they are continually moving</text>
  <text start="1224.95" dur="7.599">military assets into position now out in</text>
  <text start="1228.89" dur="7.289">Syria Russia and the Syrian military</text>
  <text start="1232.549" dur="5.971">jets have not conducted any raids 10</text>
  <text start="1236.179" dur="5.37">kilometers around Aleppo for eight days</text>
  <text start="1238.52" dur="6.48">right now they&amp;#39;re allowing civilians who</text>
  <text start="1241.549" dur="5.071">are leaving the city to use any of the</text>
  <text start="1245" dur="3.769">six humanitarian corridors which are</text>
  <text start="1246.62" dur="5.849">open 24/7</text>
  <text start="1248.769" dur="5.41">the reconciliation center that Russia</text>
  <text start="1252.469" dur="4.86">has has delivered about 10 tonnes of</text>
  <text start="1254.179" dur="5.19">humanitarian aid to Aleppo and Russia</text>
  <text start="1257.329" dur="4.32">and Syria authorities are ready to</text>
  <text start="1259.369" dur="4.77">resume humanitarian pauses in Aleppo if</text>
  <text start="1261.649" dur="4.68">it gets guarantees from international</text>
  <text start="1264.139" dur="5.01">organizations that they are ready to let</text>
  <text start="1266.329" dur="8.72">patients wounded civilians leave the</text>
  <text start="1269.149" dur="8.66">area held by the militants now turkey is</text>
  <text start="1275.049" dur="5.62">saying that they are going to continue</text>
  <text start="1277.809" dur="5.8">their Euphrates shield operation in</text>
  <text start="1280.669" dur="5.64">northern Syria and they don&amp;#39;t care what</text>
  <text start="1283.609" dur="5.55">the Syrian government says so wait</text>
  <text start="1286.309" dur="6.18">Turkey is in a sovereign nation they</text>
  <text start="1289.159" dur="6.18">invaded this country and they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="1292.489" dur="4.5">what the country says so realistically</text>
  <text start="1295.339" dur="4.89">we have turkey the United States the</text>
  <text start="1296.989" dur="5.91">coalition forces inside of Syria they</text>
  <text start="1300.229" dur="5.67">have invaded and they&amp;#39;re ignoring the</text>
  <text start="1302.899" dur="6.99">government wishes now we are getting</text>
  <text start="1305.899" dur="8.58">another indicator that an event is on</text>
  <text start="1309.889" dur="6.95">our way remember prior to 9/11 where the</text>
  <text start="1314.479" dur="6.12">owner of the World Trade Center took out</text>
  <text start="1316.839" dur="7.54">terrorism insurance well very</text>
  <text start="1320.599" dur="6.96">interestingly the American International</text>
  <text start="1324.379" dur="6.63">Group AIG said on Wednesday that it has</text>
  <text start="1327.559" dur="6.84">quadrupled its global capacity to cover</text>
  <text start="1331.009" dur="8.4">terrorist attacks on property to 1</text>
  <text start="1334.399" dur="9.6">billion dollars and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1339.409" dur="7.74">right now is companies are out there and</text>
  <text start="1343.999" dur="11.4">they&amp;#39;re taking out terrorism insurance</text>
  <text start="1347.149" dur="10.52">right now this tells us that something</text>
  <text start="1355.399" dur="5.541">is on the way because corporations</text>
  <text start="1357.669" dur="8.5">they&amp;#39;re not gonna lose any money and</text>

  <text start="1373.099" dur="7.591">insurance to cover their losses just</text>
  <text start="1375.94" dur="7.449">like the World Trade Center</text>
  <text start="1380.69" dur="3.659">took out terrorism insurance months</text>
  <text start="1383.389" dur="4.441">before it happened</text>
  <text start="1384.349" dur="6.54">to cover its losses they already knew it</text>
  <text start="1387.83" dur="7.529">was going to happen we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="1390.889" dur="7.441">same thing happen once again this is an</text>
  <text start="1395.359" dur="6.18">indicator letting us know that they are</text>
  <text start="1398.33" dur="6.269">almost ready for the next event</text>
  <text start="1401.539" dur="4.73">and everyone should be prepared for what</text>
  <text start="1404.599" dur="5.67">is coming because you have to remember</text>
  <text start="1406.269" dur="9.01">this entire system its crumbling and</text>
  <text start="1410.269" dur="8.071">falling apart and we can see that they</text>
  <text start="1415.279" dur="6.72">can&amp;#39;t keep the system operating much</text>
