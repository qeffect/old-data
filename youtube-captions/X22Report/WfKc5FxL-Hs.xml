  <text start="114.91" dur="4.51">gold and silver</text>
  <text start="116.69" dur="3.87">I do believe everyone needs to have I</text>

  <text start="129.229" dur="3.601">central banks they want their gold back</text>
  <text start="131.269" dur="4.411">and they want to hold on to gold why</text>
  <text start="132.83" dur="5.7">because the store of wealth it protects</text>
  <text start="135.68" dur="6.11">you from when the Fiat system goes south</text>
  <text start="138.53" dur="7.8">and it allows you to maintain your</text>
  <text start="141.79" dur="7.02">wealth now this new cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="146.33" dur="5.879">system that is being developed right now</text>
  <text start="148.81" dur="5.35">it&amp;#39;s electronic we use electronic</text>
  <text start="152.209" dur="5.191">currency today it&amp;#39;s called the fiat</text>
  <text start="154.16" dur="5.7">dollar the difference is is that the</text>
  <text start="157.4" dur="4.8">central bankers control the Federal</text>
  <text start="159.86" dur="4.62">Reserve Note and I&amp;#39;m not saying that</text>
  <text start="162.2" dur="6.45">fiat currency is bad</text>
  <text start="164.48" dur="5.94">it is bad when the central bank which is</text>
  <text start="168.65" dur="4.11">a private corporation a private western</text>
  <text start="170.42" dur="4.74">central bank is a private Wester is a</text>
  <text start="172.76" dur="5.07">private corporation it&amp;#39;s when they loan</text>
  <text start="175.16" dur="6.72">it to the government with interest</text>
  <text start="177.83" dur="6.62">attached and the government has to repay</text>
  <text start="181.88" dur="4.65">the principal plus the interest and</text>
  <text start="184.45" dur="5.47">basically to do this</text>
  <text start="186.53" dur="7.679">they need to tax the people and remember</text>
  <text start="189.92" dur="8.34">the central bank created the currency by</text>
  <text start="194.209" dur="6.331">pushing a button it wasn&amp;#39;t mind it like</text>
  <text start="198.26" dur="3.27">Bitcoin or any of the other</text>
  <text start="200.54" dur="3.15">cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="201.53" dur="4.11">it didn&amp;#39;t take a lot of energy or</text>
  <text start="203.69" dur="4.35">anything like that it just basically</text>
  <text start="205.64" dur="5.01">took a push of a button there was no</text>
  <text start="208.04" dur="4.59">work involved compared to gold and</text>
  <text start="210.65" dur="3.3">silver where they have to go and they</text>
  <text start="212.63" dur="2.609">have to locate it they have to dig for</text>
  <text start="213.95" dur="3.21">it they have to put a little bit of</text>
  <text start="215.239" dur="2.811">investment into it to get it out of the</text>
  <text start="217.16" dur="5.76">ground</text>
  <text start="218.05" dur="6.37">same thing with cryptocurrency you just</text>
  <text start="222.92" dur="5.49">can&amp;#39;t push a button and just have tons</text>
  <text start="224.42" dur="6">of coins pop up it takes a lot of time a</text>
  <text start="228.41" dur="5.52">lot of energy a lot of processing power</text>
  <text start="230.42" dur="6.3">to get those coins so there&amp;#39;s work</text>
  <text start="233.93" dur="5.94">involved in it and it&amp;#39;s getting harder</text>
  <text start="236.72" dur="4.799">and harder as time goes on and what</text>
  <text start="239.87" dur="3">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that we have</text>
  <text start="241.519" dur="3.151">gold and silver and we have crypto</text>
  <text start="242.87" dur="4.649">currencies I believe both of them</text>
  <text start="244.67" dur="4.71">together is what will be needed in the</text>
  <text start="247.519" dur="6">future because you need to remember</text>
  <text start="249.38" dur="7.139">right now we use an electronic currency</text>
  <text start="253.519" dur="5.371">which is created by the Fed and we go</text>
  <text start="256.519" dur="5.28">around we use our debit cards or credit</text>
  <text start="258.89" dur="5.79">cards our phones to pay for items even</text>
  <text start="261.799" dur="4.791">on the internet we send money back and</text>
  <text start="264.68" dur="3.33">forth currency back and forth</text>
  <text start="266.59" dur="4.889">cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="268.01" dur="6.36">well that would allow you to move</text>
  <text start="271.479" dur="6.19">currency back and forth the only</text>
  <text start="274.37" dur="6.06">difference with the cryptocurrency the</text>
  <text start="277.669" dur="4.171">blockchain system first of all it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="280.43" dur="4.29">ledger system where you can see all the</text>
  <text start="281.84" dur="5.01">transactions so basically criminals</text>
  <text start="284.72" dur="3.84">really wouldn&amp;#39;t use this because you can</text>
  <text start="286.85" dur="5.069">track down where the funds have gone</text>
  <text start="288.56" dur="5.46">it&amp;#39;s a truth machine this is why other</text>
  <text start="291.919" dur="5.281">countries are looking at blockchain</text>
  <text start="294.02" dur="5.73">technology they see how this can help</text>
  <text start="297.2" dur="3.719">the other thing that I like about it is</text>
  <text start="299.75" dur="2.76">that you don&amp;#39;t need a central bank</text>
  <text start="300.919" dur="6.921">you don&amp;#39;t need a centralized</text>
  <text start="302.51" dur="10.23">organization creating your currency and</text>
  <text start="307.84" dur="7.75">then you don&amp;#39;t need other banks so it</text>
  <text start="312.74" dur="5.179">kind of removes that whole banking</text>
  <text start="315.59" dur="4.77">structure which we&amp;#39;ve been fighting</text>
  <text start="317.919" dur="5.43">against for a very long time</text>
  <text start="320.36" dur="5.7">and since 1913 when the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="323.349" dur="5.771">basically bribed everyone to get into</text>
  <text start="326.06" dur="5.159">the system it is now time to get them</text>
  <text start="329.12" dur="5.22">out of the system and I think crypto</text>
  <text start="331.219" dur="5.25">currencies with gold and silver both of</text>
  <text start="334.34" dur="4.859">these together will allow this to happen</text>
  <text start="336.469" dur="5.491">and we can see that there are many</text>
  <text start="339.199" dur="4.56">different institutions and different</text>
  <text start="341.96" dur="5.479">social media companies and corporations</text>
  <text start="343.759" dur="5.88">like Google and Facebook who banned</text>
  <text start="347.439" dur="3.82">cryptocurrency ads now of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="349.639" dur="2.911">making the case that you know we want to</text>
  <text start="351.259" dur="3.87">protect you we want to make sure that</text>
  <text start="352.55" dur="5.579">you&amp;#39;re safe that you don&amp;#39;t invest in</text>
  <text start="355.129" dur="6.871">these crazy volatile things while they</text>
  <text start="358.129" dur="5.1">do allow ads for gambling which doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="362" dur="3.24">make sense because you&amp;#39;re just gambling</text>
  <text start="363.229" dur="4.981">your money away they don&amp;#39;t protect you</text>
  <text start="365.24" dur="5.669">there know what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="368.21" dur="4.259">saying listen don&amp;#39;t use any of this</text>
  <text start="370.909" dur="4.141">stuff we&amp;#39;re gonna create something that</text>
  <text start="372.469" dur="4.891">will allow you to use and we could see</text>
  <text start="375.05" dur="4.919">this already now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="377.36" dur="7.47">that Facebook banned cryptocurrency ads</text>
  <text start="379.969" dur="7.35">and now it looks like Facebook they are</text>
  <text start="384.83" dur="4.47">reorganizing shaking it up with</text>
  <text start="387.319" dur="4.38">management and we know that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="389.3" dur="4.35">testifying in front of Congress about</text>
  <text start="391.699" dur="4.56">privacy policies and stuff like that but</text>
  <text start="393.65" dur="4.259">we could see that they are preparing and</text>
  <text start="396.259" dur="5.551">they&amp;#39;re setting up a small group to</text>
  <text start="397.909" dur="6.54">explore how to best leverage blockchain</text>
  <text start="401.81" dur="5.849">across Facebook starting from scratch</text>
  <text start="404.449" dur="7.14">and they&amp;#39;re looking to create guess what</text>
  <text start="407.659" dur="6.12">their own cryptocurrency a virtual token</text>
  <text start="411.589" dur="4.021">that would allow its billions of users</text>
  <text start="413.779" dur="6.45">around the world to make electronic</text>
  <text start="415.61" dur="9">payments very interesting we also see</text>
  <text start="420.229" dur="6.93">Australia the government of Australia is</text>
  <text start="424.61" dur="5.04">considering a framework governing</text>
  <text start="427.159" dur="7.29">emerging technologies such as blockchain</text>
  <text start="429.65" dur="7.769">in order to transform trade so the move</text>
  <text start="434.449" dur="4.951">would give the DHA a further outlet into</text>
  <text start="437.419" dur="4.74">fun and legitimate trading activity and</text>
  <text start="439.4" dur="5.729">it comes as the same week as Australia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="442.159" dur="5.85">2018-2019 budget allocated for about 700</text>
  <text start="445.129" dur="4.741">thousand to blockchain research now what</text>
  <text start="448.009" dur="4.5">is the Australian government saying</text>
  <text start="449.87" dur="4.379">about blockchain well blockchain is a</text>
  <text start="452.509" dur="4.35">tool</text>
  <text start="454.249" dur="5.28">and gives you greater visibility of who</text>
  <text start="456.859" dur="6.72">entered data into the system it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="459.529" dur="6.18">truth machine you can always find out by</text>
  <text start="463.579" dur="5">going back throughout the ledger of</text>
  <text start="465.709" dur="5.88">where all these transactions occurred oh</text>
  <text start="468.579" dur="5.05">so wait a minute I thought criminals</text>
  <text start="471.589" dur="3.21">would use this I thought terrorists</text>
  <text start="473.629" dur="3.69">would use this but if it&amp;#39;s a truth</text>
  <text start="474.799" dur="4.32">machine and you can go back and find out</text>
  <text start="477.319" dur="3.36">who did the transaction how is this</text>
  <text start="479.119" dur="3.45">possible remember we talked about this</text>
  <text start="480.679" dur="4.59">report that China had where they said</text>
  <text start="482.569" dur="4.23">yeah terrorists wouldn&amp;#39;t really use the</text>
  <text start="485.269" dur="3.93">blockchain technology they really</text>
  <text start="486.799" dur="4.98">wouldn&amp;#39;t use the crypto market it just</text>
  <text start="489.199" dur="3.99">wouldn&amp;#39;t make sense and for those people</text>
  <text start="491.779" dur="3.63">are still thinking like crypto</text>
  <text start="493.189" dur="4.2">currencies it&amp;#39;s not going to happen yeah</text>
  <text start="495.409" dur="4.38">it is happening it&amp;#39;s happening just like</text>
  <text start="497.389" dur="4.471">the Internet happening and I remember</text>
  <text start="499.789" dur="4.65">going back in time and I&amp;#39;m going to date</text>
  <text start="501.86" dur="7.589">myself here when I first got my first</text>
  <text start="504.439" dur="8.37">Atari computer with a 300 baud modem and</text>
  <text start="509.449" dur="5.34">I used to visit built-in boards and back</text>
  <text start="512.809" dur="3.15">then you really couldn&amp;#39;t get on the</text>
  <text start="514.789" dur="3.63">internet it was a little bit difficult</text>
  <text start="515.959" dur="5.01">to get on the internet but then we also</text>
  <text start="518.419" dur="5.131">had you know prodigy from Sears that</text>
  <text start="520.969" dur="4.68">came on board and then we had a o L</text>
  <text start="523.55" dur="4.709">which gave you a dial-up connection into</text>
  <text start="525.649" dur="4.11">the internet and still many people were</text>
  <text start="528.259" dur="3.721">out there saying you know what is this</text>
  <text start="529.759" dur="4.83">going to be used for I it&amp;#39;s unsafe I</text>
  <text start="531.98" dur="4.289">would never put my credit card you on</text>
  <text start="534.589" dur="3.271">the internet I would never do my banking</text>
  <text start="536.269" dur="3.451">on the internet I would never do</text>
  <text start="537.86" dur="3.87">anything on the Internet I don&amp;#39;t see any</text>
  <text start="539.72" dur="4.83">use for this whatsoever but there were</text>
  <text start="541.73" dur="5.88">smart people that said hey this is going</text>
  <text start="544.55" dur="5.67">to be something that&amp;#39;s going to be huge</text>
  <text start="547.61" dur="5.61">in the future and we&amp;#39;re gonna buy up as</text>
  <text start="550.22" dur="5.76">many domain names as possible and it</text>
  <text start="553.22" dur="4.26">only cost like 25 cents 10 cents to buy</text>
  <text start="555.98" dur="3.51">these domain names so we&amp;#39;re gonna buy as</text>
  <text start="557.48" dur="4.229">many which possibly can and hopefully</text>
  <text start="559.49" dur="3.81">once thing once this thing starts to</text>
  <text start="561.709" dur="2.911">take off because all you have to do is</text>
  <text start="563.3" dur="3.45">hold them you really have to do much</text>
  <text start="564.62" dur="3.959">with them and once it starts to take off</text>
  <text start="566.75" dur="4.74">we&amp;#39;re gonna sell them back to the</text>
  <text start="568.579" dur="4.98">companies and these individuals made a</text>
  <text start="571.49" dur="3.779">huge amount of money the same thing is</text>
  <text start="573.559" dur="4.26">happening with cryptocurrency right now</text>
  <text start="575.269" dur="4.5">yes bitcoin is out there and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="577.819" dur="5.01">many other coins out there right now but</text>
  <text start="579.769" dur="5.94">this is the very very early stages we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="582.829" dur="4.891">seeing so much happen in a very short</text>
  <text start="585.709" dur="2.461">period of time that this is going to</text>
  <text start="587.72" dur="2.73">blow</text>
  <text start="588.17" dur="5.969">everything else out of the water as time</text>
  <text start="590.45" dur="6.3">goes on and you need to understand</text>
  <text start="594.139" dur="5.041">cryptocurrency you need to use it you</text>
  <text start="596.75" dur="4.769">need to get into it because once this</text>
  <text start="599.18" dur="3.779">transition occurs all these different</text>
  <text start="601.519" dur="2.971">countries that are looking at blockchain</text>

  <text start="738.02" dur="5.76">saying that they need to speed up the</text>

  <text start="804.2" dur="4.14">something this means something is not</text>

  <text start="811.13" dur="4.92">money out of the market right now taking</text>
  <text start="812.96" dur="5.94">my profits and that&amp;#39;s it we see the</text>
  <text start="816.05" dur="5.52">housing bubble is in a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="818.9" dur="5.4">trouble most Americans don&amp;#39;t know but</text>
  <text start="821.57" dur="5.85">the housing market is heading towards</text>
  <text start="824.3" dur="7.11">another epic collapse of this gigantic</text>
  <text start="827.42" dur="6.12">bubble the bubble forming today is much</text>
  <text start="831.41" dur="6.18">different than the subprime housing</text>
  <text start="833.54" dur="5.22">meltdown in 2007 back in 2007 there was</text>
  <text start="837.59" dur="4.41">an oversupply of homes</text>
  <text start="838.76" dur="5.01">whereas today there is a shortage of</text>
  <text start="842" dur="4.92">homes now why is there a shortage of</text>
  <text start="843.77" dur="5.16">homes well because a lot of hedge funds</text>
  <text start="846.92" dur="3.72">investment companies they purchased a</text>
  <text start="848.93" dur="4.2">lot of the homes they&amp;#39;re keeping them</text>
  <text start="850.64" dur="4.499">off the market banks are told not to</text>
  <text start="853.13" dur="4.709">foreclose on those homes but</text>
  <text start="855.139" dur="6.781">people live in there this drives prices</text>
  <text start="857.839" dur="7.62">up and the other problem we have today</text>
  <text start="861.92" dur="6.389">which is very different than 2007-2008</text>
  <text start="865.459" dur="5.67">crisis is that wages have not kept up</text>
  <text start="868.309" dur="4.981">with rising home values for example the</text>
  <text start="871.129" dur="6.12">average hourly earnings have only</text>
  <text start="873.29" dur="6.299">increased 21% since 2009 however the</text>
  <text start="877.249" dur="4.5">u.s. median home price of three hundred</text>
  <text start="879.589" dur="4.53">thirty three hundred and thirty thousand</text>
  <text start="881.749" dur="5.82">in the first quarter of 2018 has</text>
  <text start="884.119" dur="8.15">increased by fifty three percent a huge</text>
  <text start="887.569" dur="8.52">difference and there is a very big</text>
  <text start="892.269" dur="6.31">difference in the cost of building a new</text>
  <text start="896.089" dur="6.69">home it&amp;#39;s much higher than it was in</text>
  <text start="898.579" dur="6">2006 at the peak of 2006 the u.s. median</text>
  <text start="902.779" dur="3.96">new home price was around two hundred</text>
  <text start="904.579" dur="5.31">sixty two thousand versus three hundred</text>
  <text start="906.739" dur="5.28">and thirty seven today the u.s. median</text>
  <text start="909.889" dur="5.7">new home price is sixty percent higher</text>
  <text start="912.019" dur="7.47">than the low in 2009 now Steve st.</text>
  <text start="915.589" dur="5.34">Angelo is looking at the housing market</text>
  <text start="919.489" dur="4.35">and he&amp;#39;s saying that this is going to be</text>
  <text start="920.929" dur="5.16">a three stage collapse and this is how</text>
  <text start="923.839" dur="4.5">the housing market most likely will come</text>
  <text start="926.089" dur="4.74">down this time the first stage of the</text>
  <text start="928.339" dur="5.28">housing collapse will occur when the</text>
  <text start="930.829" dur="5.97">broader markets experience a 25 to 50</text>
  <text start="933.619" dur="5.31">percent sell-off at this point the u.s.</text>
  <text start="936.799" dur="4.5">median home price will fall around 40</text>
  <text start="938.929" dur="4.35">percent to two hundred thousand as US</text>
  <text start="941.299" dur="4.95">oil production continues to decline</text>
  <text start="943.279" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;ll enter the second stage as the u.s.</text>
  <text start="946.249" dur="4.56">median home price drops sixty percent to</text>
  <text start="948.619" dur="4.02">a hundred and twenty thousand the third</text>
  <text start="950.809" dur="5.041">stage of the US housing collapse will</text>
  <text start="952.639" dur="5.31">occur likely by 2030 or maybe a little</text>
  <text start="955.85" dur="6.389">bit sooner as domestic oil production</text>
  <text start="957.949" dur="6">Falls from 50 to 75 percent as Americans</text>
  <text start="962.239" dur="3.72">and citizens of the world understand</text>
  <text start="963.949" dur="4.29">that oil production will continue to</text>
  <text start="965.959" dur="4.74">decline the value of stocks bonds real</text>
  <text start="968.239" dur="5.611">estate will also continue to fall which</text>
  <text start="970.699" dur="5.49">is why I see the US median home price to</text>
  <text start="973.85" dur="5.569">be around 40 thousand in the third stage</text>
  <text start="976.189" dur="5.73">of the collapse and again if this is</text>
  <text start="979.419" dur="4.39">collapsing and we know the housing</text>
  <text start="981.919" dur="5.79">market the bubbles are popping in Canada</text>
  <text start="983.809" dur="5.041">Australia&amp;#39;s in a huge housing bubble we</text>
  <text start="987.709" dur="3.511">see Europe is an</text>
  <text start="988.85" dur="4.77">in bubble the UK and the United States</text>
  <text start="991.22" dur="8.369">once this falls apart we know what</text>
  <text start="993.62" dur="7.949">happened back in 2008 people lost equity</text>
  <text start="999.589" dur="4.56">in their homes a lot of people lost</text>
  <text start="1001.569" dur="5.431">their homes this time it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="1004.149" dur="6.87">much much worse the Fed has about four</text>
  <text start="1007" dur="6.93">and a half trillion of toxic assets on</text>
  <text start="1011.019" dur="6.541">their books we&amp;#39;re at the lowest interest</text>
  <text start="1013.93" dur="5.579">rate possible which well not really the</text>
  <text start="1017.56" dur="3.75">lowest we can go negative but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1019.509" dur="3.901">starting to creep up now as the interest</text>
  <text start="1021.31" dur="4.17">rates creep up it&amp;#39;s pushing a lot of</text>
  <text start="1023.41" dur="4.019">people out of the real estate market how</text>
  <text start="1025.48" dur="4.439">high can they bring it until the entire</text>
  <text start="1027.429" dur="4.051">system comes down well Michael Pento the</text>
  <text start="1029.919" dur="5.611">interview I just did with him he says</text>
  <text start="1031.48" dur="6.75">two more rate increases will invert the</text>
  <text start="1035.53" dur="5.789">yield curve and we are in a recession</text>
  <text start="1038.23" dur="5.969">now the central bankers know this Trump</text>
  <text start="1041.319" dur="5.041">Patriots they notice this is why we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1044.199" dur="5.581">been talking about controlling the</text>
  <text start="1046.36" dur="5.189">narrative we&amp;#39;re at the end cycle right</text>
  <text start="1049.78" dur="4.259">now and once the housing market falls</text>
  <text start="1051.549" dur="4.891">apart this leads into everything else it</text>
  <text start="1054.039" dur="4.5">leads into the banking system it leads</text>
  <text start="1056.44" dur="4.739">into the insurance companies it leads</text>

  <text start="1069.4" dur="3.44">apart now let&amp;#39;s talk about the banks</text>
  <text start="1071.32" dur="4.229">because that will lead into mortgages</text>
