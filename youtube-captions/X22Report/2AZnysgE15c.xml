  <text start="134.29" dur="5.43">we get to that I want to talk about</text>
  <text start="136.26" dur="5.68">political correctness and the mainstream</text>
  <text start="139.72" dur="5.06">media over the many many years have been</text>
  <text start="141.94" dur="7.89">trying to force the American people into</text>
  <text start="144.78" dur="7.75">speaking a certain way not to you know</text>
  <text start="149.83" dur="3.93">hurt someone not to spread hatreds and</text>
  <text start="152.53" dur="4.08">that that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="153.76" dur="5.729">here but there&amp;#39;s a new survey that was</text>
  <text start="156.61" dur="6.3">done and a new report called hidden</text>
  <text start="159.489" dur="5.041">tribes and it researched political</text>
  <text start="162.91" dur="4.65">correctness and what the American people</text>
  <text start="164.53" dur="5.67">think about it and contrary to the</text>
  <text start="167.56" dur="4.74">common narrative majorities of Americans</text>
  <text start="170.2" dur="4.23">of all ages income levels and racial</text>
  <text start="172.3" dur="6.39">backgrounds strongly oppose political</text>
  <text start="174.43" dur="7.05">correctness 80% of Americans say</text>
  <text start="178.69" dur="5.1">political correctness is a problem in</text>
  <text start="181.48" dur="4.53">our country and this is according to a</text>
  <text start="183.79" dur="2.94">newly released data from a nationally</text>
  <text start="186.01" dur="3.54">representative</text>
  <text start="186.73" dur="6.39">Paul drawing upon 8,000 survey</text>
  <text start="189.55" dur="6.18">respondents 31 our interviews and six</text>
  <text start="193.12" dur="6.03">focus groups some of this data compiled</text>
  <text start="195.73" dur="5.369">what compiled with help from you gov has</text>
  <text start="199.15" dur="5.309">been newly released in a report called</text>
  <text start="201.099" dur="5.401">hidden tribes now opposition against</text>
  <text start="204.459" dur="5.461">political correctness was higher among</text>
  <text start="206.5" dur="6">Asians 82% Hispanics 87 percent in</text>
  <text start="209.92" dur="4.98">American Indians 88 percent then among</text>
  <text start="212.5" dur="6.75">white Americans which is 79 percent in</text>
  <text start="214.9" dur="7.169">fact just about every single demographic</text>
  <text start="219.25" dur="5.459">study showed overwhelming objection</text>
  <text start="222.069" dur="5.881">to political correctness except the</text>
  <text start="224.709" dur="5.451">Americans the study reporting the poll</text>
  <text start="227.95" dur="3.74">resulted identified as progressive</text>
  <text start="230.16" dur="4.12">activists</text>
  <text start="231.69" dur="6.31">progressive activists the study says</text>
  <text start="234.28" dur="7.14">have an outside outsized role in</text>
  <text start="238" dur="6.03">political discourse even though they</text>
  <text start="241.42" dur="6.99">comprise of a small portion of the total</text>
  <text start="244.03" dur="7.35">population about 1 in 12 Americans so</text>
  <text start="248.41" dur="6">it&amp;#39;s this small tiny group that is</text>
  <text start="251.38" dur="5.37">pushing political correctness running it</text>
  <text start="254.41" dur="5.34">through the mainstream media making</text>
  <text start="256.75" dur="5.07">everyone think that everybody is behind</text>
  <text start="259.75" dur="4.56">this and again this is what the deep</text>
  <text start="261.82" dur="5.58">state does they use the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="264.31" dur="5.4">to think everyone is behind this and we</text>
  <text start="267.4" dur="5.76">can see that no people are not behind</text>
  <text start="269.71" dur="5.28">this we don&amp;#39;t need a government or an</text>
  <text start="273.16" dur="5.729">establishment to tell us how to speak</text>
  <text start="274.99" dur="6.66">the free freedom of speech is the</text>
  <text start="278.889" dur="4.171">freedom to say whatever you want yes</text>
  <text start="281.65" dur="4.17">there are going to be people that are</text>
  <text start="283.06" dur="5.669">offended yes it&amp;#39;s gonna sound like hate</text>
  <text start="285.82" dur="7.11">to certain groups but that&amp;#39;s the beauty</text>
  <text start="288.729" dur="6.75">of free speech some people will not want</text>
  <text start="292.93" dur="5.52">to listen that&amp;#39;s their choice other</text>
  <text start="295.479" dur="6.721">people will want to listen that&amp;#39;s their</text>
  <text start="298.45" dur="6.719">choice but you have the freedom to say</text>
  <text start="302.2" dur="5.939">what you need to say and you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="305.169" dur="6.601">to correct your wording you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="308.139" dur="6.301">to leave out certain words if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="311.77" dur="5.22">want to just like with any news</text>
  <text start="314.44" dur="5.19">broadcast with with anyone saying</text>
  <text start="316.99" dur="6.81">anything you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="319.63" dur="7.38">please every single group and person</text>
  <text start="323.8" dur="7.74">it&amp;#39;s completely impossible it does not</text>
  <text start="327.01" dur="6.36">work because if you say that oh you</text>
  <text start="331.54" dur="3.75">shouldn&amp;#39;t be saying this because people</text>
  <text start="333.37" dur="4.02">don&amp;#39;t like this another group will say</text>
  <text start="335.29" dur="4.11">well what you&amp;#39;re saying now offends us</text>
  <text start="337.39" dur="3.75">and then if you try to correct it again</text>
  <text start="339.4" dur="3.69">another group can say well you just</text>
  <text start="341.14" dur="4.86">corrected it but you&amp;#39;re offending us</text>
  <text start="343.09" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s impossible to do and the founding</text>
  <text start="346" dur="5.43">fathers knew that everyone needed to</text>
  <text start="348.28" dur="4.68">have this right of free speech and if</text>
  <text start="351.43" dur="3.18">you really don&amp;#39;t like it just like if</text>
  <text start="352.96" dur="3.3">you don&amp;#39;t like a radio show if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="354.61" dur="5.13">like a television show if you don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="356.26" dur="6.96">a movie guess what that&amp;#39;s how you show</text>
  <text start="359.74" dur="7.52">these individuals these groups that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="363.22" dur="6.39">not okay so if somebody says something</text>
  <text start="367.26" dur="5.2">nobody listen and guess what happens</text>
  <text start="369.61" dur="4.26">since nobody&amp;#39;s listening you don&amp;#39;t hear</text>
  <text start="372.46" dur="3.6">from this person that much anymore or</text>
  <text start="373.87" dur="3.62">you don&amp;#39;t see the show that much or you</text>
  <text start="376.06" dur="5.43">don&amp;#39;t hear this radio show that much</text>
  <text start="377.49" dur="9.16">that&amp;#39;s how it works we see out in</text>
  <text start="381.49" dur="6.96">Afghanistan the Taliban delegation has</text>
  <text start="386.65" dur="5.46">met the u.s. special advisor to</text>
  <text start="388.45" dur="5.28">Afghanistan in Qatar to discuss the</text>
  <text start="392.11" dur="4.53">ending of the conflict in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="393.73" dur="4.8">right now and the sides discussed a</text>
  <text start="396.64" dur="5.64">peaceful end to the invasion in</text>
  <text start="398.53" dur="6.39">Afghanistan so it looks like this is</text>
  <text start="402.28" dur="5.64">moving forward and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="404.92" dur="5.79">agreeing that there should be peace and</text>
  <text start="407.92" dur="4.92">I believe we&amp;#39;re gonna see peace and</text>
  <text start="410.71" dur="4.89">Afghanistan we&amp;#39;re going to see peace in</text>
  <text start="412.84" dur="5.37">Syria Iraq the entire Middle East</text>
  <text start="415.6" dur="4.29">remember who pushed these wars in the</text>
  <text start="418.21" dur="4.14">Middle East it was the deep state</text>
  <text start="419.89" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re the ones who pushed the war to</text>
  <text start="422.35" dur="7.83">keep their system alive the central</text>
  <text start="425.26" dur="6.93">banking system the petro dollar now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="430.18" dur="5.82">all falling apart there&amp;#39;s no reason to</text>
  <text start="432.19" dur="5.22">have all these wars especially once the</text>
  <text start="436" dur="4.92">dollar is no longer the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="437.41" dur="5.31">and the petro dollar ceases to exist and</text>
  <text start="440.92" dur="4.02">guess what there&amp;#39;s no reason to keep</text>
  <text start="442.72" dur="3.96">troops there whatsoever and we can see</text>
  <text start="444.94" dur="4.05">that these countries once the people</text>
  <text start="446.68" dur="3.39">take back their country and they decide</text>
  <text start="448.99" dur="3.39">you know something we don&amp;#39;t want to use</text>
  <text start="450.07" dur="3.43">the dollar anymore and remember this is</text>
  <text start="452.38" dur="3.55">not the US</text>
  <text start="453.5" dur="4.68">this is a Federal Reserve Note this is a</text>
  <text start="455.93" dur="4.71">Central Bank Note has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="458.18" dur="5.19">the US we didn&amp;#39;t ask for this system it</text>
  <text start="460.64" dur="5.82">was forced upon us we want a different</text>
  <text start="463.37" dur="5.46">system so this is what is happening out</text>
  <text start="466.46" dur="5.67">in the Middle East and around the world</text>
  <text start="468.83" dur="5.25">where countries are saying you know</text>
  <text start="472.13" dur="3.81">something the war needs to come to an</text>
  <text start="474.08" dur="3.18">end there&amp;#39;s no reason for it and I do</text>
  <text start="475.94" dur="3.81">believe Trump in the Patriots they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="477.26" dur="5.7">out there pushing for peace remember</text>
  <text start="479.75" dur="4.74">they need to take what this the deep</text>
  <text start="482.96" dur="3.9">state the central bank has been doing</text>
  <text start="484.49" dur="5.25">for a very long time and they need to</text>
  <text start="486.86" dur="5.85">reverse it and push peace in this area</text>
  <text start="489.74" dur="5.01">remember these countries have only known</text>
  <text start="492.71" dur="4.64">war for a very long time</text>
  <text start="494.75" dur="5.88">you think they trust the u.s. no and</text>
  <text start="497.35" dur="6.1">it&amp;#39;s very difficult to get countries to</text>
  <text start="500.63" dur="5.67">trust a country that pushed war in their</text>
  <text start="503.45" dur="4.74">country and this is why with the brunch</text>
  <text start="506.3" dur="4.59">and release where Trump is saying that</text>
  <text start="508.19" dur="6.63">we didn&amp;#39;t make a deal turkey went ahead</text>
  <text start="510.89" dur="6.05">and released Brunson this is a very huge</text>
  <text start="514.82" dur="5.28">step that means there&amp;#39;s trust there</text>
  <text start="516.94" dur="7.51">respect but of course Obama was out</text>
  <text start="520.1" dur="6.87">there and he quickly took credit for the</text>
  <text start="524.45" dur="4.98">release of Brunson and he was out</text>
  <text start="526.97" dur="4.56">talking at a press conference and he</text>
  <text start="529.43" dur="4.26">said the following look people are</text>
  <text start="531.53" dur="4.17">saying Trump&amp;#39;s strong-arm tactics like</text>
  <text start="533.69" dur="4.2">economic sanctions are responsible for</text>
  <text start="535.7" dur="4.8">Brunson&amp;#39;s release but hey don&amp;#39;t forget</text>
  <text start="537.89" dur="6.72">who should really get credit for this me</text>
  <text start="540.5" dur="7.44">Obama look when when was Brunton first</text>
  <text start="544.61" dur="4.5">arrested October 2016 that&amp;#39;s right the</text>
  <text start="547.94" dur="3.42">man gets arrested during the</text>
  <text start="549.11" dur="3.78">administration and now Republicans want</text>
  <text start="551.36" dur="3.45">to give Trump credit for his release</text>
  <text start="552.89" dur="3.89">just because he applied crippling</text>
  <text start="554.81" dur="6.06">pressure to Iran until the deed was done</text>
  <text start="556.78" dur="5.71">please he added I mean seriously he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="560.87" dur="4.26">really trying to take credit for this I</text>
  <text start="562.49" dur="5.16">mean think about the warped way this</text>
  <text start="565.13" dur="4.08">individual is thinking and how he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="567.65" dur="5.1">trying to convince the people that it</text>
  <text start="569.21" dur="5.07">was him now Trump says that there was no</text>
  <text start="572.75" dur="3.9">deal and he actually tweeted this out</text>
  <text start="574.28" dur="4.8">there was no deal made with Turkey for</text>
  <text start="576.65" dur="5.19">the release and return of Pastor Andrew</text>
  <text start="579.08" dur="6.03">Brunson I don&amp;#39;t make deals for hostages</text>
  <text start="581.84" dur="5.249">there was however great appreciation on</text>
  <text start="585.11" dur="4.679">behalf of the United States which will</text>
  <text start="587.089" dur="5.67">- good perhaps great relations between</text>
  <text start="589.789" dur="6.48">the United States and Turkey so we can</text>
  <text start="592.759" dur="6.78">see right now this was done with No Deal</text>
  <text start="596.269" dur="5.4">and Turkey decided to do this yes the</text>
  <text start="599.539" dur="3.99">Trump administration did ask to have</text>
  <text start="601.669" dur="4.5">Brunson released and I&amp;#39;m sure they were</text>
  <text start="603.529" dur="5.73">certain to go negotiations but there was</text>
  <text start="606.169" dur="6.24">no deal made now yesterday or Friday we</text>
  <text start="609.259" dur="5.58">talked about how Hillary Clinton she had</text>
  <text start="612.409" dur="6.99">her security clearance not actually</text>
  <text start="614.839" dur="6.36">taken away at her request she decided</text>
  <text start="619.399" dur="4.53">she didn&amp;#39;t want it anymore but we need</text>
  <text start="621.199" dur="5.1">to back up a little bit here now she had</text>
  <text start="623.929" dur="5.34">her security clearance withdrawn in</text>

  <text start="695.749" dur="5.97">did Clinton request that her security</text>
  <text start="699.049" dur="5.79">clearance be taken away or remember</text>
  <text start="701.719" dur="3.69">Trump took away Brennan&amp;#39;s security</text>
  <text start="704.839" dur="4.17">clearance</text>
  <text start="705.409" dur="8.1">back in August August 15th and Clinton</text>
  <text start="709.009" dur="7.65">wrote a letter on August 30th now why</text>
  <text start="713.509" dur="5.94">did she do this I think she did this</text>
  <text start="716.659" dur="3.731">because she didn&amp;#39;t want Trump to take</text>
  <text start="719.449" dur="4.961">her clear</text>
  <text start="720.39" dur="6.54">away because if this did happen this</text>
  <text start="724.41" dur="5.82">would be publicized this would be out in</text>
  <text start="726.93" dur="6.27">the open people would say why would you</text>
  <text start="730.23" dur="6.12">have to take away clinton&amp;#39;s security</text>
  <text start="733.2" dur="5.19">clearance what would be the reasoning</text>
  <text start="736.35" dur="3.9">for this and everyone at that point</text>
  <text start="738.39" dur="4.98">would think that she must have done</text>
  <text start="740.25" dur="6.269">something wrong also just like Brennan</text>
  <text start="743.37" dur="6.209">why was his taken away very interesting</text>
  <text start="746.519" dur="4.231">so she decided she&amp;#39;s going to say I</text>
  <text start="749.579" dur="3.961">don&amp;#39;t need it anymore</text>
  <text start="750.75" dur="6.87">this way it got no press pretty much</text>
  <text start="753.54" dur="6.989">whatsoever and I do believe all of this</text>
  <text start="757.62" dur="5.61">is hooked into what is going on with</text>
  <text start="760.529" dur="7.62">Saudi Arabia now remember</text>
  <text start="763.23" dur="8.7">Jamal kosugi was allegedly killed in the</text>
  <text start="768.149" dur="7.56">Saudi consulate in Turkey and right off</text>
  <text start="771.93" dur="7.08">the bat her one came out and started to</text>
  <text start="775.709" dur="4.44">say hey it wasn&amp;#39;t us it was Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="779.01" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re the ones who did it in the</text>
  <text start="780.149" dur="5.341">consulate we saw the individual walk in</text>
  <text start="782.1" dur="5.94">but never walk out and it&amp;#39;s really Saudi</text>
  <text start="785.49" dur="4.529">Arabia not us and I think her Diwan</text>
  <text start="788.04" dur="5.159">actually came out and said this right</text>
  <text start="790.019" dur="4.771">off the bat because I think he saw what</text>
  <text start="793.199" dur="3.061">was happening do I think her one</text>
  <text start="794.79" dur="3.5">actually had something to do with this I</text>
  <text start="796.26" dur="5.819">don&amp;#39;t think so at this time I think</text>
  <text start="798.29" dur="4.51">Turkey and Russia they they&amp;#39;re becoming</text>
  <text start="802.079" dur="3.421">closer</text>
  <text start="802.8" dur="4.95">I think Turkey just relieved released</text>
  <text start="805.5" dur="5.31">Brunson and what would be the point</text>
  <text start="807.75" dur="7.199">right now to start something up with</text>
  <text start="810.81" dur="7.05">Saudi Arabia and remember Russia kind of</text>
  <text start="814.949" dur="6.301">controls Iran right now and they have a</text>
  <text start="817.86" dur="5.88">mano leash so I don&amp;#39;t think her one was</text>
  <text start="821.25" dur="4.05">about to do anything like this yes he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="823.74" dur="3.659">a bad man he&amp;#39;s done many many other</text>
  <text start="825.3" dur="4.92">things before but I don&amp;#39;t think it was</text>
  <text start="827.399" dur="4.891">him I think something else is going on</text>
  <text start="830.22" dur="4.53">here and he was out there trying to say</text>
  <text start="832.29" dur="4.71">listen it wasn&amp;#39;t Turkey now remember</text>
  <text start="834.75" dur="4.68">this was a consulate inside of Turkey</text>
  <text start="837" dur="5.91">very interesting right off the bat here</text>
  <text start="839.43" dur="5.339">and yes do I think Turkey spies on the</text>
  <text start="842.91" dur="4.95">Saudis inside the consulate many others</text>
  <text start="844.769" dur="5.521">yes but let&amp;#39;s continue here because</text>
  <text start="847.86" dur="5.55">right off the bat you&amp;#39;re hearing a lot</text>
  <text start="850.29" dur="3.97">of different Senators Congressmen the</text>
  <text start="853.41" dur="2.59">mainstream</text>
  <text start="854.26" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re all out there saying we must</text>
  <text start="856" dur="5.04">halt arm sales to Saudi Arabia Trump</text>
  <text start="858.67" dur="4.47">must do something we must get to the</text>
  <text start="861.04" dur="6.72">bottom of this and this is the beginning</text>
  <text start="863.14" dur="9.35">cause of Trump to do something now we</text>
  <text start="867.76" dur="6.87">see that Trump said listen this is bad</text>
  <text start="872.49" dur="6.12">it&amp;#39;s not a good thing that happened here</text>
  <text start="874.63" dur="7.17">and he&amp;#39;s gonna call the crown prince</text>
  <text start="878.61" dur="5.65">find out what was going on here and if</text>
  <text start="881.8" dur="5.31">some and if the Saudis did do it there</text>
  <text start="884.26" dur="5.03">would be severe punishment if it ordered</text>
  <text start="887.11" dur="7.11">the murder of a Washington Post</text>
  <text start="889.29" dur="6.28">journalist who was Jamal cash hoagie so</text>
  <text start="894.22" dur="4.14">this is very interesting right off the</text>
  <text start="895.57" dur="5.79">bat it&amp;#39;s Washington Post it&amp;#39;s a Saudi</text>
  <text start="898.36" dur="8.06">who was against the Saudi government who</text>
  <text start="901.36" dur="7.62">is missing right now allegedly killed so</text>
  <text start="906.42" dur="4.69">what happened here this individual</text>
  <text start="908.98" dur="5.25">walked in supposedly looking for</text>
  <text start="911.11" dur="5.07">documents because he was trying to show</text>
  <text start="914.23" dur="4.08">that you know he was divorced from his</text>
  <text start="916.18" dur="4.55">ex-wife and he had this new girlfriend</text>
  <text start="918.31" dur="5.31">and maybe they were getting married and</text>
  <text start="920.73" dur="6.01">the report came out from Turkey saying</text>
  <text start="923.62" dur="5.76">that they had video recordings of what</text>
  <text start="926.74" dur="4.71">happened inside and then we heard this</text>
  <text start="929.38" dur="3.78">story about an Apple watch which I</text>
  <text start="931.45" dur="3.57">mentioned on Friday that he was wearing</text>
  <text start="933.16" dur="5.429">this Apple watch and everything was</text>
  <text start="935.02" dur="5.04">recorded a lot of this doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="938.589" dur="6.231">sense we&amp;#39;re gonna get into that in just</text>
  <text start="940.06" dur="9.09">a moment so what we see here is</text>
  <text start="944.82" dur="6.58">something was set up put into place and</text>
  <text start="949.15" dur="5.84">Turkey was already saying that it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="951.4" dur="6.87">them and the mainstream media and</text>
  <text start="954.99" dur="7.9">congressmen and Senators they&amp;#39;re all now</text>
  <text start="958.27" dur="6.689">looking at Trump now Saudi Arabia has</text>
  <text start="962.89" dur="4.889">put out a report saying that they will</text>
  <text start="964.959" dur="7.471">respond to any steps taking against them</text>
  <text start="967.779" dur="7.021">and they rejected any of the allegations</text>
  <text start="972.43" dur="4.14">that they did anything and then what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="974.8" dur="3.75">very interesting is this statement was</text>
  <text start="976.57" dur="5.69">then taken down from Saudi Arabia now</text>
  <text start="978.55" dur="6.61">remember what is Saudi Arabia Hugh</text>
  <text start="982.26" dur="4.999">designated Saudi Arabia as Wonderland</text>
  <text start="985.16" dur="4.349">for the deep state and we&amp;#39;ll get into</text>
  <text start="987.259" dur="5.221">that in just a minute so the mainstream</text>
  <text start="989.509" dur="5.13">media is putting up things like you know</text>
  <text start="992.48" dur="4.349">Trump&amp;#39;s response to cast hoagies</text>
  <text start="994.639" dur="4.37">murderer reveals he&amp;#39;s more than willing</text>
  <text start="996.829" dur="5.641">to look the other way for a price and</text>
  <text start="999.009" dur="6.221">they&amp;#39;re trying to drag him in here so</text>
  <text start="1002.47" dur="6.719">let&amp;#39;s kind of break this down a little</text>
  <text start="1005.23" dur="7.02">bit a Washington Post reporter who</text>
  <text start="1009.189" dur="5.52">criticized Saudi Arabia has gone missing</text>
  <text start="1012.25" dur="5.759">in Saud in the Saudi consulate in Turkey</text>
  <text start="1014.709" dur="4.68">her Dewan right now is defending Turkey</text>
  <text start="1018.009" dur="3.63">trying to say that Turkey had nothing to</text>
  <text start="1019.389" dur="4.05">do with this Saudi Arabia are the ones</text>
  <text start="1021.639" dur="5.251">who did it remember this happened in</text>
  <text start="1023.439" dur="6.091">Turkey turkey says they have video but</text>
  <text start="1026.89" dur="4.38">won&amp;#39;t release it some say there was an</text>
  <text start="1029.53" dur="3.72">Apple watch involved but there&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="1031.27" dur="4.95">no proof about that and that&amp;#39;s how they</text>
  <text start="1033.25" dur="6.27">got the recordings so why doesn&amp;#39;t her</text>
  <text start="1036.22" dur="6.51">one release the video one reason could</text>
  <text start="1039.52" dur="5.1">be that they have cameras inside that</text>
  <text start="1042.73" dur="3.569">the Saudis didn&amp;#39;t know about they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1044.62" dur="3.449">been spying on the Saudis with hidden</text>
  <text start="1046.299" dur="3.901">cameras and they don&amp;#39;t want to reveal</text>
  <text start="1048.069" dur="3.961">that they&amp;#39;ve been doing this so I</text>
  <text start="1050.2" dur="4.02">believe maybe they made up the story</text>
  <text start="1052.03" dur="3.6">that this individual is wearing an Apple</text>
  <text start="1054.22" dur="7.35">watch and this is how they know this</text>
  <text start="1055.63" dur="8.909">information let&amp;#39;s continue here so the</text>
  <text start="1061.57" dur="6.96">Saudi Arabia really care about this</text>
  <text start="1064.539" dur="6.481">reporter most likely not and if they</text>
  <text start="1068.53" dur="4.649">were going to kill him why did they do</text>
  <text start="1071.02" dur="4.11">it in the consulate let&amp;#39;s think about</text>
  <text start="1073.179" dur="3.181">this for a second what what would be the</text>
  <text start="1075.13" dur="3.33">reason for this if they were going to</text>
  <text start="1076.36" dur="4.46">get rid of them why not do it on the</text>
  <text start="1078.46" dur="4.92">street and make it look like an accident</text>
  <text start="1080.82" dur="6.849">so that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense right right</text>
  <text start="1083.38" dur="6.12">there and then why point the finger to</text>
  <text start="1087.669" dur="4.26">yourself if you&amp;#39;re going to murder</text>
  <text start="1089.5" dur="3.539">someone do it on the street make it look</text>
  <text start="1091.929" dur="2.88">like an accident there&amp;#39;s many many</text>
  <text start="1093.039" dur="6.181">different ways of doing this so this</text>
  <text start="1094.809" dur="7.681">makes no sense so the staff inside of</text>
  <text start="1099.22" dur="7.14">the consulate they were told to take the</text>
  <text start="1102.49" dur="7.29">day off on the same exact day Casa</text>
  <text start="1106.36" dur="5.309">hoagie disappeared so the Turkish staff</text>
  <text start="1109.78" dur="3.869">at the Saudi consulate we&amp;#39;re told that</text>
  <text start="1111.669" dur="3.99">the reason was an important diplomatic</text>
  <text start="1113.649" dur="4.41">meeting was going to happen in the</text>
  <text start="1115.659" dur="3.441">building and this is what&amp;#39;s coming from</text>
  <text start="1118.059" dur="4.671">the security forces</text>
  <text start="1119.1" dur="6.6">so the question is was this a hit from</text>
  <text start="1122.73" dur="6.12">the deep state to put Turkey and Saudi</text>
  <text start="1125.7" dur="6.66">Arabia against each other and then bring</text>
  <text start="1128.85" dur="6.15">in Trump into the fold push the</text>
  <text start="1132.36" dur="6.149">narrative that he will look the other</text>
  <text start="1135" dur="6.12">way for a price and he must do something</text>
  <text start="1138.509" dur="4.741">now remember Trump was out there a</text>
  <text start="1141.12" dur="5.73">couple days ago saying that maybe Saudi</text>
  <text start="1143.25" dur="6.87">Arabia should pay for us protection now</text>
  <text start="1146.85" dur="5.819">this was a dig at the petrodollar system</text>
  <text start="1150.12" dur="5.309">because back in the 70s this was set up</text>
  <text start="1152.669" dur="5.25">where listen you sell your oil using the</text>
  <text start="1155.429" dur="5.401">dollar and the US would protect you so</text>
  <text start="1157.919" dur="4.681">Trump was signaling that we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1160.83" dur="3.569">get rid of this petro dollar deal and</text>
  <text start="1162.6" dur="4.319">these Middle Eastern countries are going</text>
  <text start="1164.399" dur="7.201">to have to pay for protection now</text>
  <text start="1166.919" dur="8.071">now remember Saudi Arabia is the center</text>
  <text start="1171.6" dur="8.34">of almost all of this and the deep state</text>
  <text start="1174.99" dur="7.799">still controls Saudi Arabia now UK</text>
