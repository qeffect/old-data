  <text start="193.89" dur="4.77">successful yes in the beginning of the</text>
  <text start="196.5" dur="5.28">system it was back in the 70s the 80s</text>
  <text start="198.66" dur="5.1">when things were just all coming out and</text>
  <text start="201.78" dur="4.38">they were creating currency and their</text>
  <text start="203.76" dur="4.86">high interest rates and the value of the</text>
  <text start="206.16" dur="3.99">dollar was decreasing and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="208.62" dur="6.06">they raised the interest rates to level</text>
  <text start="210.15" dur="6.66">it off and we saw inflation people</text>

  <text start="226.68" dur="7.05">pushed up to twenty five thousand this</text>
  <text start="228.75" dur="8.34">is incredible well that time has come</text>
  <text start="233.73" dur="6.03">and gone start a business people were</text>
  <text start="237.09" dur="6.539">getting credit cards then people were</text>
  <text start="239.76" dur="6.03">taking out loans to purchase homes and</text>
  <text start="243.629" dur="5.551">it got better in the 80s interest rates</text>
  <text start="245.79" dur="7.44">came down things got even better credit</text>
  <text start="249.18" dur="6.989">was completely accessible went into the</text>
  <text start="253.23" dur="5.539">90s then things started to change and</text>
  <text start="256.169" dur="6.091">that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and</text>
  <text start="258.769" dur="5.381">America was the place in the world for</text>
  <text start="262.26" dur="4.82">those who wanted to work for themselves</text>
  <text start="264.15" dur="4.829">our free market capitalist system it</text>
  <text start="267.08" dur="3.519">created an environment which</text>
  <text start="268.979" dur="4.5">entrepreneurs and small businesses</text>
  <text start="270.599" dur="5.701">greatly thrived but everything has</text>
  <text start="273.479" dur="5.491">changed and the number of self-employed</text>
  <text start="276.3" dur="5.94">Americans is now lower than it was in</text>
  <text start="278.97" dur="5.28">nineteen ninety and if we look at this</text>
  <text start="282.24" dur="3.929">we can see in April nineteen ninety</text>
  <text start="284.25" dur="4.2">eight point seven million Americans were</text>
  <text start="286.169" dur="4.591">self-employed but today only eight point</text>
  <text start="288.45" dur="4.89">four million Americans are self-employed</text>
  <text start="290.76" dur="4.82">and that number is continually dropping</text>
  <text start="293.34" dur="5.79">why because we have the retail</text>
  <text start="295.58" dur="6.76">apocalypse and what&amp;#39;s not being reported</text>
  <text start="299.13" dur="6.719">is all the little tiny mom-and-pop</text>
  <text start="302.34" dur="7.29">retail shops that just can&amp;#39;t make it all</text>
  <text start="305.849" dur="5.431">we&amp;#39;re hearing is the big chains that are</text>
  <text start="309.63" dur="4.38">going out of business now remember our</text>
  <text start="311.28" dur="5.759">population it has grown its much larger</text>
  <text start="314.01" dur="4.38">right now and in the 90s there was two</text>
  <text start="317.039" dur="2.341">hundred and forty nine million people</text>
  <text start="318.39" dur="1.89">living the United States but today</text>
  <text start="319.38" dur="4.92">there&amp;#39;s three hundred</text>
  <text start="320.28" dur="5.67">1 million so what this means is that the</text>
  <text start="324.3" dur="4.8">percentage of population that is</text>
  <text start="325.95" dur="5.55">self-employed is way down now according</text>
  <text start="329.1" dur="5.22">to economist Tim Kaine the number of</text>
  <text start="331.5" dur="5.43">startup jobs per 1000 Americans has been</text>
  <text start="334.32" dur="5.39">declining for several consecutive</text>
  <text start="336.93" dur="5.36">presidential administrations bush senior</text>
  <text start="339.71" dur="7.2">eleven point three percent decline</text>
  <text start="342.29" dur="8.29">Clinton 11.2% Bush jr. 10.8 percent</text>
  <text start="346.91" dur="8.23">Obama seven point eight percent all in</text>
  <text start="350.58" dur="8.13">decline again every single sector that</text>
  <text start="355.14" dur="7.02">we&amp;#39;re looking at has not been improving</text>
  <text start="358.71" dur="6.36">except for the stock market of course we</text>
  <text start="362.16" dur="6.8">talked about new home sales where</text>
  <text start="365.07" dur="8.67">they&amp;#39;ve declined now existing home sales</text>
  <text start="368.96" dur="7.12">they have dropped by 2.3 percent now</text>
  <text start="373.74" dur="6.84">let&amp;#39;s think about this for a second we</text>
  <text start="376.08" dur="8.85">are at the end of May housing sales</text>
  <text start="380.58" dur="7.38">usually ramp up starting in March going</text>
  <text start="384.93" dur="6.39">into April May and by the time August</text>
  <text start="387.96" dur="6.53">hits they start to slow this is the hot</text>
  <text start="391.32" dur="7.77">season for real estate no pun intended</text>
  <text start="394.49" dur="6.06">this is when the sales come in we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="399.09" dur="4.41">supposed to see these percentages</text>
  <text start="400.55" dur="5.95">skyrocketing right now and if you go</text>
  <text start="403.5" dur="5.76">back to my reports last year we saw this</text>
  <text start="406.5" dur="5.64">same exact thing actually I think I use</text>
  <text start="409.26" dur="4.29">the same exact joke where I said this is</text>
  <text start="412.14" dur="5.94">supposed to be the hot season no pun</text>
  <text start="413.55" dur="7.4">intended and what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="418.08" dur="5.72">is interest rates are creeping up</text>
  <text start="420.95" dur="5.98">applications are completely falling and</text>
  <text start="423.8" dur="5.44">in the 20 cities where they monitor the</text>
  <text start="426.93" dur="4.95">home prices they&amp;#39;re showing that yes</text>
  <text start="429.24" dur="5.549">home prices are increasing now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="431.88" dur="5.01">not happening everywhere but they like</text>
  <text start="434.789" dur="3.63">to put that out there that well the</text>
  <text start="436.89" dur="3.42">housing market in these certain areas</text>
  <text start="438.419" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re doing well home prices are still</text>
  <text start="440.31" dur="5.31">ticking up and everywhere else we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="443.789" dur="4.461">want to report on well everywhere else</text>
  <text start="445.62" dur="6.93">that&amp;#39;s the majority of the country and</text>
  <text start="448.25" dur="5.26">if we look at the percentage of sales</text>
  <text start="452.55" dur="1.5">from a year ago</text>
  <text start="453.51" dur="3.119">the</text>
  <text start="454.05" dur="6.42">change in sales we can see according to</text>
  <text start="456.629" dur="6.391">price that things are really really bad</text>
  <text start="460.47" dur="4.199">I mean price is from zero to a hundred</text>
  <text start="463.02" dur="3.929">thousand I don&amp;#39;t know anyhow that&amp;#39;s from</text>
  <text start="464.669" dur="6.451">zero but a hundred thousand dollars or</text>
  <text start="466.949" dur="7.741">less down negative sixteen point eight</text>
  <text start="471.12" dur="6.6">percent houses from two hundred to two</text>
  <text start="474.69" dur="6.09">hundred and fifty thousand down negative</text>
  <text start="477.72" dur="6.539">six point three percent and the only</text>
  <text start="480.78" dur="6.569">homes that are actually doing well is in</text>
  <text start="484.259" dur="5.78">the upper brackets where we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="487.349" dur="5.701">at seven hundred and fifty thousand and</text>
  <text start="490.039" dur="6.19">over where they&amp;#39;re up around twelve</text>
  <text start="493.05" dur="7.29">percent again what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a</text>
  <text start="496.229" dur="8.011">shift in wealth and everyone else in</text>
  <text start="500.34" dur="8.039">between it&amp;#39;s not helping and what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="504.24" dur="8.07">been seeing is decline in real estate a</text>
  <text start="508.379" dur="7.02">decline in retail a decline in auto</text>
  <text start="512.31" dur="5.399">sales we&amp;#39;re seeing a rise in corporate</text>
  <text start="515.399" dur="4.32">defaults we&amp;#39;re seeing a rise in the</text>
  <text start="517.709" dur="5.46">amount of commercial real estate that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="519.719" dur="5.401">out there and this whole thing is going</text>
  <text start="523.169" dur="3.501">to be disaster now it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="525.12" dur="4.74">happening here in the United States</text>
  <text start="526.67" dur="5.35">Canada they have bubbles all over the</text>
  <text start="529.86" dur="4.71">place they&amp;#39;re deflating throughout</text>
  <text start="532.02" dur="5.64">Europe Australia actually the ECB was</text>
  <text start="534.57" dur="7.259">out there and they mentioned something</text>
  <text start="537.66" dur="7.41">very interesting they said well there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="541.829" dur="9.901">an excessive exuberance in house prices</text>
  <text start="545.07" dur="9.329">and they&amp;#39;re saying that well houses in</text>
  <text start="551.73" dur="5.91">the European markets they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="554.399" dur="6.151">driven by offshore buyers that this</text>
  <text start="557.64" dur="5.52">could spread to other areas in a ripple</text>
  <text start="560.55" dur="5.039">effect separately the ECB also said debt</text>
  <text start="563.16" dur="4.02">sustainability concerns have risen in</text>
  <text start="565.589" dur="3.87">the past six months amid a potential</text>
  <text start="567.18" dur="5.339">increase in yield and political</text>
  <text start="569.459" dur="5.221">uncertainty in some countries now</text>
  <text start="572.519" dur="4.5">basically what central banks like to do</text>
  <text start="574.68" dur="4.5">is I like to leak out some of these</text>
  <text start="577.019" dur="4.44">warnings but it never hits the main</text>
  <text start="579.18" dur="5.73">corporate media it&amp;#39;s in the back</text>
  <text start="581.459" dur="6.121">channels and they keep this there</text>
  <text start="584.91" dur="4.44">because when the crisis does hit they</text>
  <text start="587.58" dur="5.1">say well we did have the warning out</text>
  <text start="589.35" dur="5.67">there so you can&amp;#39;t blame us and this is</text>
  <text start="592.68" dur="3.33">what they do every single time even</text>
  <text start="595.02" dur="2.01">though it&amp;#39;s not out in the corporate</text>
  <text start="596.01" dur="3.54">media they&amp;#39;re going to still tell you</text>
  <text start="597.03" dur="4.95">that everything is fine but behind the</text>
  <text start="599.55" dur="4.59">scenes behind what is going on they put</text>
  <text start="601.98" dur="5.13">out these little warnings and they hope</text>
  <text start="604.14" dur="4.47">that nobody&amp;#39;s really looking and what is</text>
  <text start="607.11" dur="3.54">really happening right now is we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="608.61" dur="5.1">seeing warning after warning after a</text>
  <text start="610.65" dur="5.25">warning now something very interesting</text>
  <text start="613.71" dur="4.92">and David Stockman actually mentioned</text>
  <text start="615.9" dur="5.79">this that the government would not be</text>
  <text start="618.63" dur="5.16">able to make it through August and we</text>
  <text start="621.69" dur="5.52">already see White House budget director</text>
  <text start="623.79" dur="6.18">Nick Mulvaney he is warning lawmakers</text>
  <text start="627.21" dur="5.88">that they might have to vote before they</text>
  <text start="629.97" dur="5.34">leave on vacation in August because they</text>
  <text start="633.09" dur="5.22">leave August first they don&amp;#39;t come back</text>
  <text start="635.31" dur="6.42">until after Labor Day because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="638.31" dur="6.51">saying that we don&amp;#39;t have enough money</text>
  <text start="641.73" dur="6.18">to make it through August we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="644.82" dur="4.32">enough tax receipts coming into the</text>
  <text start="647.91" dur="3.48">government which is very interesting</text>
  <text start="649.14" dur="7.44">because this is exactly what David</text>
  <text start="651.39" dur="8.7">Stockman said and as we can see that we</text>
  <text start="656.58" dur="5.73">have a major problem here the tax</text>
  <text start="660.09" dur="6.33">receipts coming into the government has</text>
  <text start="662.31" dur="5.45">continually declined why even though</text>
  <text start="666.42" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;re at four point four percent</text>
  <text start="667.76" dur="5.08">unemployment we&amp;#39;re at full employment no</text>
  <text start="670.89" dur="3.36">what&amp;#39;s happening is people are losing</text>
  <text start="672.84" dur="3.54">their full-time job they lose their</text>
  <text start="674.25" dur="4.64">full-time jobs they&amp;#39;re not making the</text>
  <text start="676.38" dur="5.4">same exact money so that means less</text>
  <text start="678.89" dur="4.15">taxes are being paid now those people</text>
  <text start="681.78" dur="3.78">who are falling off the market</text>
  <text start="683.04" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re not making anything those people</text>
  <text start="685.56" dur="4.17">have taken part-time jobs most likely</text>
  <text start="687.99" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re making a quarter or half of what</text>
  <text start="689.73" dur="6.93">they were making so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="691.86" dur="8.1">right now is less money coming into the</text>
  <text start="696.66" dur="5.4">government if there&amp;#39;s less money coming</text>
  <text start="699.96" dur="4.35">into the government that means they</text>
  <text start="702.06" dur="5.34">can&amp;#39;t pay for all these programs which</text>
  <text start="704.31" dur="5.1">means they have to borrow more which</text>
  <text start="707.4" dur="6.17">means the situation gets worse and worse</text>
  <text start="709.41" dur="6.18">as time goes on and we can see that</text>
  <text start="713.57" dur="3.58">eventually what is going to happen as</text>
  <text start="715.59" dur="3.98">more and more people lose their jobs and</text>
  <text start="717.15" dur="5.749">more more retail stores closed and</text>

  <text start="816.6" dur="4.049">they&amp;#39;re saying the first quarters</text>

  <text start="861.07" dur="4.41">accelerate and bring the system down</text>
  <text start="863.32" dur="4.56">because it looks like they are running</text>
  <text start="865.48" dur="6.3">out of time and they want to be in full</text>
  <text start="867.88" dur="5.64">control of the take down of the system</text>
  <text start="871.78" dur="3.75">because this way they can point the</text>
  <text start="873.52" dur="4.56">finger they can tell you exactly what</text>
  <text start="875.53" dur="4.32">happened just like in some type of</text>

  <text start="888.52" dur="4.02">the story is written you know exactly</text>
  <text start="891.07" dur="3">what&amp;#39;s going to happen they know exactly</text>
  <text start="892.54" dur="3.48">where they are there&amp;#39;s no investigation</text>
  <text start="894.07" dur="3.78">whatsoever it&amp;#39;s done it&amp;#39;s almost like a</text>

  <text start="897.85" dur="3.66">with cyber attacks would three days</text>
  <text start="899.05" dur="3.24">later we know exactly who it was how</text>
  <text start="901.51" dur="3.15">they did it</text>
  <text start="902.29" dur="4.71">what the code is they know exactly</text>
  <text start="904.66" dur="4.65">everything this is what they want to do</text>

  <text start="911.59" dur="8.75">who was to blame for it and this is what</text>
  <text start="915.25" dur="5.09">they&amp;#39;re doing now the Fed they are also</text>
  <text start="920.37" dur="4.78">broadcasting warnings now not on the</text>
  <text start="922.51" dur="5.1">corporate media you&amp;#39;re not going to see</text>
  <text start="925.15" dur="4.35">this on CNN saying hey the Fed is</text>
  <text start="927.61" dur="4.65">warning that the vulnerabilities they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="929.5" dur="4.26">seeing elevated as valuations and it</text>
  <text start="932.26" dur="3.99">poses a risk to financial stability</text>
  <text start="933.76" dur="6.63">because that is their warning in their</text>
  <text start="936.25" dur="5.73">papers and you&amp;#39;re not going to see this</text>
  <text start="940.39" dur="4.11">on the corporate media because they</text>
  <text start="941.98" dur="4.59">don&amp;#39;t broadcast that stuff they&amp;#39;ll tell</text>
  <text start="944.5" dur="6.39">you the economy is doing fine but they</text>
  <text start="946.57" dur="6.33">need this in some type of report to show</text>
  <text start="950.89" dur="3.96">people later that no we knew this was</text>
  <text start="952.9" dur="4.23">going to happen because when you look</text>
  <text start="954.85" dur="5.64">back in time this is what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="957.13" dur="5.82">to show even though you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="960.49" dur="4.38">remember not seeing any of it or saying</text>
  <text start="962.95" dur="4.65">that we don&amp;#39;t see any of this even if we</text>
  <text start="964.87" dur="4.38">go back to 2008 with Ben Bernanke where</text>
  <text start="967.6" dur="4.59">he says in our forecasting recession and</text>
  <text start="969.25" dur="5.64">you look at their papers you show that</text>
  <text start="972.19" dur="5.13">yes something was going on they show</text>
  <text start="974.89" dur="4.17">that there was a problem they know</text>
  <text start="977.32" dur="4.23">exactly what&amp;#39;s happening they cover</text>
  <text start="979.06" dur="5.64">themselves that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re doing now</text>
  <text start="981.55" dur="4.77">they understand they realize that things</text>
  <text start="984.7" dur="2.07">are breaking apart when we have to</text>
  <text start="986.32" dur="2.61">remember</text>
  <text start="986.77" dur="5.759">Bank of America based on 20</text>
  <text start="988.93" dur="6.51">widely-used valuation metrics the SNP</text>
  <text start="992.529" dur="7.861">remains significantly overvalued on 18</text>
  <text start="995.44" dur="6.81">of the 20 valuation metrics so what is</text>
  <text start="1000.39" dur="5.009">happening right now is we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="1002.25" dur="6.17">push to bring down the system now on the</text>
  <text start="1005.399" dur="7.891">other side Trump is out of the country</text>
  <text start="1008.42" dur="6.31">but his push is to bring down the system</text>
  <text start="1013.29" dur="4.68">this is why all the bubbles are being</text>
  <text start="1014.73" dur="5.43">blown up this is why he&amp;#39;s looking at all</text>
  <text start="1017.97" dur="6.209">the different land and all the natural</text>
  <text start="1020.16" dur="5.7">resources looking to drill oil to make</text>
  <text start="1024.179" dur="3.481">sure that we have the ability to sustain</text>
  <text start="1025.86" dur="3.51">ourselves because we&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="1027.66" dur="3">able to get products from anywhere it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1029.37" dur="3.66">going to be very very difficult when the</text>
  <text start="1030.66" dur="3.679">whole system collapses all these trade</text>
  <text start="1033.03" dur="4.169">deals are gonna have to be renegotiated</text>
  <text start="1034.339" dur="5.201">everything has to be redone because the</text>
  <text start="1037.199" dur="3.63">dollar will not be involved with this it</text>
  <text start="1039.54" dur="4.74">won&amp;#39;t be the reserve currency anymore</text>
  <text start="1040.829" dur="4.771">and giving countries dollars they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1044.28" dur="2.7">just going to give us their products</text>
  <text start="1045.6" dur="2.4">it&amp;#39;s not just going to happen like that</text>
  <text start="1046.98" dur="3.18">we&amp;#39;re going to have to have some type of</text>
  <text start="1048" dur="6.179">trade and this is what he&amp;#39;s preparing</text>
  <text start="1050.16" dur="5.73">for now he&amp;#39;s pushing his budget we know</text>
  <text start="1054.179" dur="3.601">this is not going to pass and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1055.89" dur="4.65">showing that listen we have two choices</text>
  <text start="1057.78" dur="4.56">here it&amp;#39;s either we cut like there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1060.54" dur="3.06">tomorrow and people are going to have to</text>
  <text start="1062.34" dur="4.589">go out and fend for themselves</text>
  <text start="1063.6" dur="6.45">and I know this economy is not driven to</text>
  <text start="1066.929" dur="5.671">help people and this is why the central</text>
  <text start="1070.05" dur="4.56">banks this is why the government this is</text>
  <text start="1072.6" dur="4.25">why they like people on all of these</text>
  <text start="1074.61" dur="3.93">type of programs it keeps them quiet</text>
  <text start="1076.85" dur="3.459">think about if we didn&amp;#39;t have these</text>
