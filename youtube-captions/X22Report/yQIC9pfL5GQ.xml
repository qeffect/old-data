  <text start="128.75" dur="6.41">the extra step to say hey listen we have</text>
  <text start="131.84" dur="8.34">this list people are on there and</text>
  <text start="135.16" dur="8.14">they&amp;#39;re looking to come after you and we</text>

  <text start="152.42" dur="7.86">notified but the question is why didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="156.62" dur="7.26">the FBI notify them was this being used</text>
  <text start="160.28" dur="5.46">for propaganda was there no Islamic</text>
  <text start="163.88" dur="5.7">aight really going after any of these</text>
  <text start="165.74" dur="6.51">people is this completely fake because</text>
  <text start="169.58" dur="8.07">it seems like the FBI is not taking this</text>
  <text start="172.25" dur="9.11">too seriously and usually when they kind</text>
  <text start="177.65" dur="6.6">of avoid things like this it means that</text>
  <text start="181.36" dur="5.17">they&amp;#39;re not real because we know the</text>
  <text start="184.25" dur="3.72">Islamic state is the proxy army of</text>

  <text start="197.18" dur="5.25">the FBI set these people up so then we</text>
  <text start="200.09" dur="8.18">have to come to the conclusion that this</text>
  <text start="202.43" dur="10.26">is also fake so the State Department</text>
  <text start="208.27" dur="7.87">they&amp;#39;re spending 21.5 million dollars</text>

  <text start="860.7" dur="4.62">happens here in the corporate media they</text>
  <text start="862.59" dur="3.87">blame it on the other country and we can</text>
  <text start="865.32" dur="3.11">see why they&amp;#39;re doing this because</text>
  <text start="866.46" dur="4.22">they&amp;#39;re trying to build the propaganda</text>
  <text start="868.43" dur="4.75">now the u.s. is looking to deploy</text>

  <text start="887.61" dur="6.14">they&amp;#39;re loaded with military trucks</text>
  <text start="888.93" dur="8.82">tanks they&amp;#39;re heading to Syria right now</text>
  <text start="893.75" dur="5.98">we see Iran the Iran&amp;#39;s supreme National</text>

  <text start="901.56" dur="6.84">discussing what is going on in Syria now</text>
  <text start="905.46" dur="6.15">very interestingly we know in Syria the</text>
  <text start="908.4" dur="6.75">US has Special Ops teams we know France</text>
  <text start="911.61" dur="6.42">we know Germany Norway and many other</text>
  <text start="915.15" dur="5.73">countries that we probably haven&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="918.03" dur="5.64">heard of yet have their teams inside of</text>
  <text start="920.88" dur="6.9">Syria now we know they&amp;#39;ve been training</text>
  <text start="923.67" dur="5.85">the terrorist groups el Nostra al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="927.78" dur="4.89">the moderate rebels are all one in the</text>
  <text start="929.52" dur="5.51">same they&amp;#39;re training them for this</text>
  <text start="932.67" dur="4.5">major offensive we also know there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="935.03" dur="4.15">training drill that was going on in</text>
  <text start="937.17" dur="4.02">Jordan we know the military assets were</text>
  <text start="939.18" dur="4.62">all left their troops were left there</text>
  <text start="941.19" dur="4.92">and the question is what are they</text>
  <text start="943.8" dur="4.26">planning here now we know a lot of</text>
  <text start="946.11" dur="6.75">military assets have been pouring in</text>
  <text start="948.06" dur="8.13">weapons surface-to-air missiles had been</text>
  <text start="952.86" dur="6.93">handed to al-nusrah we know Turkey has</text>
  <text start="956.19" dur="6.44">received upgraded military hardware we</text>
  <text start="959.79" dur="7.7">know that there&amp;#39;s travel alerts all</text>
  <text start="962.63" dur="6.45">the place and then we get word that US</text>
  <text start="967.49" dur="3.83">Special Forces they&amp;#39;re vetting</text>
  <text start="969.08" dur="5.54">opposition group leaders in Syria and</text>
  <text start="971.32" dur="6.9">all the other terrorists leaders and</text>
  <text start="974.62" dur="8.35">training them on how to call in</text>
  <text start="978.22" dur="9.52">precision airstrikes from the coalition</text>
  <text start="982.97" dur="6.9">forces who are they striking are they</text>
  <text start="987.74" dur="4.44">striking the Islamic state are they</text>
  <text start="989.87" dur="6.03">striking al-qaeda are they striking</text>
  <text start="992.18" dur="6.81">al-nusrah of course not they&amp;#39;re the ones</text>
  <text start="995.9" dur="8.97">calling the strike in there going to be</text>
  <text start="998.99" dur="10.5">striking Assad forces so the United</text>
  <text start="1004.87" dur="5.7">States they&amp;#39;re identifying groups that</text>
  <text start="1009.49" dur="6.03">can handle this and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1010.57" dur="8.24">training them all this time this is</text>
  <text start="1015.52" dur="7.2">another indicator that something is</text>
  <text start="1018.81" dur="8.2">about to happen in this area and we just</text>
  <text start="1022.72" dur="8.13">keep piling them up we see out in Turkey</text>
  <text start="1027.01" dur="6.449">in Istanbul there was an explosion there</text>
  <text start="1030.85" dur="4.859">was gunfire it could be a false flag</text>
  <text start="1033.459" dur="4.771">depends how this all turns out most</text>
  <text start="1035.709" dur="5.161">likely it is we&amp;#39;ll see what iran says</text>
  <text start="1038.23" dur="5.94">it&amp;#39;s probably someone in Syria probably</text>
  <text start="1040.87" dur="5.459">the PKK or anything like that because</text>
  <text start="1044.17" dur="3.84">they need to get into Syria and they</text>
  <text start="1046.329" dur="3.541">keep showing us that look we&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="1048.01" dur="4.8">attacked by Syria so the United States</text>
  <text start="1049.87" dur="6.36">they extended the travel warning in</text>
  <text start="1052.81" dur="7.37">Turkey the one that was dated March 29</text>

  <text start="1091.24" dur="5.96">are still leaving this is another</text>
  <text start="1094.72" dur="2.48">indicator</text>
  <text start="1097.499" dur="6.461">we see that the Islamic state they</text>
  <text start="1101.47" dur="5.639">released a video threatening san</text>

  <text start="1107.109" dur="5.31">of this is fake we know this is all</text>
  <text start="1109.21" dur="6.539">propaganda to get us all indoctrinated</text>
  <text start="1112.419" dur="6.81">into thinking that yes the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1115.749" dur="5.52">is coming after us that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>

  <text start="1126.549" dur="7.411">they&amp;#39;re getting ready to move the next</text>
  <text start="1129.369" dur="6.5">event forward remember the economy is to</text>
  <text start="1133.96" dur="4.849">turret deteriorating very very quickly</text>
  <text start="1135.869" dur="7.12">they didn&amp;#39;t expect the brexit at all</text>
  <text start="1138.809" dur="7.75">this is a complete black swan type of</text>
  <text start="1142.989" dur="7.41">scenario here they&amp;#39;re trying to get</text>
  <text start="1146.559" dur="5.73">everything completed because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1150.399" dur="4.74">want the economy coming down so they</text>
  <text start="1152.289" dur="5.73">need the UK to step away they need to</text>
  <text start="1155.139" dur="8.4">reinforce the EU nations and say we are</text>
  <text start="1158.019" dur="10.25">a strong European force here because the</text>
  <text start="1163.539" dur="9.96">next step to all this is blaming a group</text>
  <text start="1168.269" dur="7.931">blaming a country for the entire economy</text>
  <text start="1173.499" dur="4.35">collapsing because they already have it</text>

  <text start="1179.95" dur="5.52">already have it planned on when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1182.59" dur="4.919">going to do this and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1185.47" dur="3.659">anything messing up their plans now</text>
  <text start="1187.509" dur="4.38">sometimes it does happen where their</text>
  <text start="1189.129" dur="4.591">plans are completely messed up but we</text>
  <text start="1191.889" dur="4.46">can see right now that they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1193.72" dur="7.049">do whatever they possibly can to keep</text>
  <text start="1196.349" dur="7.45">their plan on schedule and we&amp;#39;re hearing</text>
  <text start="1200.769" dur="7.35">from a lot of people that the economy</text>
  <text start="1203.799" dur="8.25">might come down this fall maybe go into</text>

  <text start="1212.049" dur="4.56">but we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of indicators</text>
  <text start="1214.539" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;re not--we&amp;#39;re noticing a lot of</text>
  <text start="1216.609" dur="4.231">economic indicators showing us that the</text>
  <text start="1218.769" dur="4.74">economy is deteriorating very very</text>
  <text start="1220.84" dur="4.339">quickly we&amp;#39;re seeing indicators that are</text>
  <text start="1223.509" dur="5.25">showing us that things are really</text>
  <text start="1225.179" dur="4.541">they&amp;#39;re ramping up out in Syria we&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="1244.48" dur="5.85">getting closer and closer to August</text>
  <text start="1246.58" dur="7.35">we&amp;#39;re getting closer to the fall and at</text>
  <text start="1250.33" dur="5.7">this point everyone needs to be prepared</text>
  <text start="1253.93" dur="4.62">now can things change of course they can</text>
  <text start="1256.03" dur="4.8">I mean we&amp;#39;re looking at indicators but</text>
  <text start="1258.55" dur="5.67">we can see already the central bankers</text>
  <text start="1260.83" dur="4.62">thought they had UK in the bag where</text>
  <text start="1264.22" dur="3.84">they were going to remain that</text>
  <text start="1265.45" dur="5.04">everything was set and it didn&amp;#39;t work</text>

  <text start="1276.73" dur="8.1">explode or implode and that can cause a</text>
  <text start="1280.51" dur="6.21">chain reaction and they realize as we</text>
  <text start="1284.83" dur="4.29">get closer and closer to this collapse</text>
  <text start="1286.72" dur="4.71">scenario that anything can trigger it</text>
