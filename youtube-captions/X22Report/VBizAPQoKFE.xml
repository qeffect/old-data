  <text start="88.02" dur="7.89">working absolutely perfectly exactly</text>
  <text start="92.42" dur="6.49">what Trump wanted to happen is happening</text>
  <text start="95.91" dur="5.519">remember Trump just tweeted out that he</text>
  <text start="98.91" dur="5.129">would like the central bank to lower</text>
  <text start="101.429" dur="5.64">interest rates that was the first tweet</text>
  <text start="104.039" dur="4.621">saying hey okay let everyone take a look</text>
  <text start="107.069" dur="4.53">at the central bank we know there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="108.66" dur="5.76">meeting coming up I want them to lower</text>
  <text start="111.599" dur="5.55">rates this should be done because the</text>
  <text start="114.42" dur="4.5">economy would boom if they don&amp;#39;t raise</text>
  <text start="117.149" dur="3.961">rates and they keep rates steady or they</text>
  <text start="118.92" dur="4.64">raise rates it&amp;#39;s going to ruin the</text>
  <text start="121.11" dur="7.2">economy and what did we see happen today</text>
  <text start="123.56" dur="7.81">well we saw the central bank do exactly</text>
  <text start="128.31" dur="4.74">what Trump wanted them to do they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="131.37" dur="4.11">raise rates now this might sound</text>
  <text start="133.05" dur="4.14">confusing but this is part of the plan</text>
  <text start="135.48" dur="3.66">which is which we&amp;#39;ll be discussing a</text>
  <text start="137.19" dur="3.6">little bit later in this report but</text>
  <text start="139.14" dur="5.099">first I wanted to go to auto sales</text>
  <text start="140.79" dur="7.529">because US auto sales in April they are</text>
  <text start="144.239" dur="7.291">declining very very rapidly they tumbled</text>
  <text start="148.319" dur="4.831">by 6.1 percent now we know going back in</text>
  <text start="151.53" dur="4.47">time how all this was done with the</text>
  <text start="153.15" dur="5.25">automobile manufacturers they took their</text>
  <text start="156" dur="5.07">cars they stuffed the dealership Lots</text>
  <text start="158.4" dur="5.22">they call them sales and sales look</text>
  <text start="161.07" dur="3.27">great on the other hand they kept</text>
  <text start="163.62" dur="2.52">lowering</text>
  <text start="164.34" dur="3.63">the credit score so more and more people</text>
  <text start="166.14" dur="4.739">went into debt they went into subprime</text>
  <text start="167.97" dur="7.23">and they kept on pushing the cars out</text>
  <text start="170.879" dur="7.371">there now there&amp;#39;s a problem the central</text>
  <text start="175.2" dur="6.66">bank system is falling apart and people</text>
  <text start="178.25" dur="6.099">well their debt level is way too high</text>
  <text start="181.86" dur="5.4">and it&amp;#39;s not just happening here in the</text>
  <text start="184.349" dur="5.461">United States it&amp;#39;s happening around the</text>
  <text start="187.26" dur="4.259">globe and this is a huge problem we know</text>
  <text start="189.81" dur="3.36">it&amp;#39;s happening in China we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="191.519" dur="4.171">happening in Europe and when we look at</text>
  <text start="193.17" dur="4.92">all the major manufacturers like Ford</text>
  <text start="195.69" dur="2.879">their sales fell by four point seven</text>
  <text start="198.09" dur="4.95">percent</text>
  <text start="198.569" dur="7.321">fiat-chrysler down 6.1 percent Toyota</text>
  <text start="203.04" dur="5.64">down four point four percent and this</text>
  <text start="205.89" dur="5.429">just goes on and on and on and what</text>
  <text start="208.68" dur="4.71">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that this is</text>
  <text start="211.319" dur="4.381">what it looks like when a system</text>
  <text start="213.39" dur="5.76">implodes on itself what system is this</text>
  <text start="215.7" dur="6.629">this is a central bank system it was</text>
  <text start="219.15" dur="6.21">never meant to last this long and Trump</text>
  <text start="222.329" dur="5.641">is doing his best to keep the system</text>
  <text start="225.36" dur="4.379">alive and this is why he needed to take</text>
  <text start="227.97" dur="3.87">control of the Fed without everyone</text>
  <text start="229.739" dur="4.801">anyone really realizing that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="231.84" dur="5.429">controlling the Fed and actually setting</text>
  <text start="234.54" dur="5.64">up the Fed in the process now when we</text>
  <text start="237.269" dur="5.761">look at US factory orders well we are</text>
  <text start="240.18" dur="5.82">seeing that they rebounded in March so</text>
  <text start="243.03" dur="4.95">US factory orders they fell four of the</text>
  <text start="246" dur="5.28">last five months and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="247.98" dur="7.08">they start to rise and they&amp;#39;ve risen by</text>
  <text start="251.28" dur="5.79">1.6 percent now what is happening here</text>
  <text start="255.06" dur="5.28">is Trump is continually bringing back</text>
  <text start="257.07" dur="5.909">jobs bringing back manufacturers having</text>
  <text start="260.34" dur="4.47">them build plants and invest in the</text>
  <text start="262.979" dur="3.991">country this takes some time and this</text>
  <text start="264.81" dur="4.05">won&amp;#39;t happen overnight it&amp;#39;s gonna slowly</text>
  <text start="266.97" dur="3.24">happen does this mean the central bank</text>
  <text start="268.86" dur="3.39">economy&amp;#39;s getting better no what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="270.21" dur="4.05">doing he&amp;#39;s bringing back the</text>
  <text start="272.25" dur="5.01">corporation&amp;#39;s the manufacturers and</text>
  <text start="274.26" dur="5.07">giving people jobs once they have jobs</text>
  <text start="277.26" dur="4.8">and they have money to spend</text>
  <text start="279.33" dur="5.82">guess what other businesses pop up</text>
  <text start="282.06" dur="5.1">around those areas and this is a very</text>
  <text start="285.15" dur="4.65">slow process but we can see that we are</text>
  <text start="287.16" dur="5.34">on our way he&amp;#39;s setting up a brand new</text>
  <text start="289.8" dur="5.429">economy once the central bank system</text>
  <text start="292.5" dur="4.62">completely implodes on itself and once</text>
  <text start="295.229" dur="4.981">we get rid of the central bank</text>
  <text start="297.12" dur="5.76">now we have some good news and some bad</text>
  <text start="300.21" dur="4.8">news the good news is that productivity</text>
  <text start="302.88" dur="5.73">is surging at its fastest rate in nine</text>
  <text start="305.01" dur="6.65">years the bad news is that it&amp;#39;s on the</text>
  <text start="308.61" dur="5.4">back of Loeb or lower labor costs and</text>
  <text start="311.66" dur="4.78">what we are seeing is that we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="314.01" dur="6.15">a mixed bag that have to do with</text>
  <text start="316.44" dur="6.78">factories producing products with people</text>
  <text start="320.16" dur="6.3">working with wages and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="323.22" dur="6.78">see a mixture moving forward because</text>
  <text start="326.46" dur="6.47">Trump is doing whatever he possibly can</text>
  <text start="330" dur="6.11">to bring back these jobs now remember</text>
  <text start="332.93" dur="6.16">before Trump was doing this wages</text>
  <text start="336.11" dur="4.09">productivity factory orders they were</text>
  <text start="339.09" dur="4.38">all declining</text>
  <text start="340.2" dur="6.3">he&amp;#39;s turning this around trying to bring</text>
  <text start="343.47" dur="5.61">back the economy so we can&amp;#39;t rent so we</text>
  <text start="346.5" dur="4.289">can transition into a new economy and</text>
  <text start="349.08" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;re going to see this mixed bag as we</text>
  <text start="350.789" dur="4.561">move forward but we need to understand</text>
  <text start="352.86" dur="5.82">is that the main mission is to get rid</text>
  <text start="355.35" dur="5.73">of the problem the problem is the</text>
  <text start="358.68" dur="5.4">central bank now he had two candidates</text>
  <text start="361.08" dur="5.13">we had Kane and we had Stephen Moore and</text>
  <text start="364.08" dur="4.589">it looks like Kane he backed out and now</text>
  <text start="366.21" dur="3.99">it looks like Stephen Moore decided to</text>
  <text start="368.669" dur="3.481">withdraw from the Fed nomination</text>
  <text start="370.2" dur="3.99">President Trump tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="372.15" dur="4.889">following Steve Moore a great growth</text>
  <text start="374.19" dur="4.5">economist and a truly fine person has</text>
  <text start="377.039" dur="4.201">decided withdraw from the Fed process</text>
  <text start="378.69" dur="5.729">Steve won the battle of ideas including</text>
  <text start="381.24" dur="5.67">tax cuts and deregulation which have</text>
  <text start="384.419" dur="4.62">produced non-inflationary prosperity for</text>
  <text start="386.91" dur="4.56">all Americans I&amp;#39;ve asked Eve to work me</text>
  <text start="389.039" dur="5.431">toward future economic growth in our</text>
  <text start="391.47" dur="4.169">country now Steven Moore and all the</text>
  <text start="394.47" dur="4.8">other people that are coming into the</text>
  <text start="395.639" dur="6.09">Fed they don&amp;#39;t know the full extent of</text>
  <text start="399.27" dur="6.149">the plan now their disagreement was on</text>
  <text start="401.729" dur="6.541">Trump&amp;#39;s wanting to cut rates and we know</text>
  <text start="405.419" dur="4.771">why this needs to be this way and these</text>
  <text start="408.27" dur="5.369">individuals they don&amp;#39;t know the full</text>
  <text start="410.19" dur="6.539">plan Trump is choosing these individuals</text>
  <text start="413.639" dur="6.181">because of their ideals and what they</text>
  <text start="416.729" dur="4.831">believe in and they believe in gold they</text>
  <text start="419.82" dur="4.349">believe in reorganization of the Federal</text>
  <text start="421.56" dur="3.659">Reserve they believe in restoring the</text>
  <text start="424.169" dur="2.851">power to the people</text>
  <text start="425.219" dur="4.761">and just because he goes through these</text>
  <text start="427.02" dur="4.76">candidates doesn&amp;#39;t mean that these</text>
  <text start="429.98" dur="4.59">are the candidates and there&amp;#39;s nobody</text>
  <text start="431.78" dur="4.41">else Trump goes through many many people</text>
  <text start="434.57" dur="3.66">and again you don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="436.19" dur="4.8">getting the right person yes you can ask</text>
  <text start="438.23" dur="4.98">many questions you can continually look</text>
  <text start="440.99" dur="5.19">at their resume you can ask them once</text>
  <text start="443.21" dur="6.42">again but you truly don&amp;#39;t know if this</text>
  <text start="446.18" dur="5.4">is the right person and sometimes they</text>
  <text start="449.63" dur="4.68">don&amp;#39;t agree with you on certain aspects</text>
  <text start="451.58" dur="5.43">he needs someone to agree on everything</text>
  <text start="454.31" dur="4.83">that he&amp;#39;s ready to do and he needs those</text>
  <text start="457.01" dur="5.16">people in the Federal Reserve so he has</text>
  <text start="459.14" dur="5.52">other choices this is part of the plan</text>
  <text start="462.17" dur="4.32">this is part of the process don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="464.66" dur="5.76">worried but what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="466.49" dur="6.44">we see gold is declining and the stock</text>
  <text start="470.42" dur="6">market is declining and the dollar is</text>
  <text start="472.93" dur="5.08">surging now once again we know Basel 3</text>
  <text start="476.42" dur="2.97">is in effect and we know there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="478.01" dur="3.12">of central banks that are purchasing</text>
  <text start="479.39" dur="4.05">gold and we know they&amp;#39;re gonna keep the</text>
  <text start="481.13" dur="4.65">gold prices down for quite a while we</text>
  <text start="483.44" dur="4.47">know that Russia China India and many</text>
  <text start="485.78" dur="4.56">other countries they&amp;#39;re accumulating</text>
  <text start="487.91" dur="5.04">gold and I believe the prices are gonna</text>
  <text start="490.34" dur="6.18">stay down very very low for a while</text>
  <text start="492.95" dur="4.89">longer maybe even up until the 2020</text>
  <text start="496.52" dur="2.73">election we might see them creep up a</text>
  <text start="497.84" dur="3.75">little bit but I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="499.25" dur="4.77">be that quick as everyone is saying</text>
  <text start="501.59" dur="4.71">because I think he needs to have</text>
  <text start="504.02" dur="4.5">everything stay the way it is so</text>
  <text start="506.3" dur="4.29">everyone believes the economy looks</text>
  <text start="508.52" dur="3.93">fantastic because he needs to set up the</text>
  <text start="510.59" dur="5.34">Fed and he needs to keep the gold price</text>
  <text start="512.45" dur="6.149">low right now so other areas can</text>
  <text start="515.93" dur="5.07">accumulate even the US even though</text>
  <text start="518.599" dur="5.701">they&amp;#39;re not saying anything and what</text>
  <text start="521" dur="7.41">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="524.3" dur="7.62">central bank has fallen right into the</text>
  <text start="528.41" dur="6.75">trap that Trump has set remember his</text>
  <text start="531.92" dur="5.84">whole entire plan is to set up the</text>
  <text start="535.16" dur="5.79">central bank to make everyone think and</text>
  <text start="537.76" dur="6.67">think logically of why this is happening</text>
  <text start="540.95" dur="6.27">and he&amp;#39;s setting it up where every time</text>
  <text start="544.43" dur="6.96">he says something and the Fed doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="547.22" dur="6.21">listen something bad happens now I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="551.39" dur="5.31">mean the world comes to an end I mean</text>
  <text start="553.43" dur="6.84">the stock market goes down so yesterday</text>
  <text start="556.7" dur="7.16">he tweeted out that he would really like</text>
  <text start="560.27" dur="6.98">a rate cut cool Oh was talking about a</text>
  <text start="563.86" dur="6.539">cut and we know that the Fed was going</text>
  <text start="567.25" dur="5.519">to have a Fed meeting he knew the Fed</text>
  <text start="570.399" dur="4.981">was going to have a Fed meeting but he</text>
  <text start="572.769" dur="6.241">didn&amp;#39;t want the Fed to cut rates just</text>
  <text start="575.38" dur="5.76">yet because he needs the mainstream</text>
  <text start="579.01" dur="4.47">media off his back he needs the deep</text>
  <text start="581.14" dur="4.62">state the others bad central bankers off</text>

  <text start="588.19" dur="4.74">them what to do I&amp;#39;m not forcing them to</text>
  <text start="590.32" dur="5.34">do anything but in reality behind the</text>
  <text start="592.93" dur="7.98">scenes he really is but he needs to make</text>
  <text start="595.66" dur="8.19">it look like he isn&amp;#39;t plus he needs to</text>
  <text start="600.91" dur="6.09">show that if the Fed doesn&amp;#39;t do what he</text>
  <text start="603.85" dur="6.51">says because he has the magic wand he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="607" dur="5.519">in control he controls the narrative the</text>
  <text start="610.36" dur="4.59">economy will fall apart and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="612.519" dur="4.56">exactly what happened think about it the</text>
