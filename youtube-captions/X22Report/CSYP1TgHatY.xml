  <text start="76.94" dur="6.39">their debt problem and right now we see</text>
  <text start="80.84" dur="8.339">that institutions agree on a common</text>
  <text start="83.33" dur="8.789">position said Sheila and he stresses</text>

  <text start="94.909" dur="6.24">point the German Fineman finance</text>
  <text start="98.149" dur="9.091">minister says that the real problem in</text>
  <text start="101.149" dur="8.97">Greece is not the debt of course it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="107.24" dur="5.58">always not the debt they always blame it</text>
  <text start="110.119" dur="6.39">on something else they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="112.82" dur="6.75">the reforms not enough austerity not</text>
  <text start="116.509" dur="6.451">enough people being laid off not enough</text>
  <text start="119.57" dur="6.99">of people giving up things well no the</text>
  <text start="122.96" dur="5.49">problem is the debt I mean if we go back</text>

  <text start="128.45" dur="5.759">Goldman Sachs where they orchestrated</text>
  <text start="131.69" dur="5.419">this entire debt deal where Goldman</text>

  <text start="137.109" dur="4.271">was put in the position of a complete</text>
  <text start="139.579" dur="5.72">disaster and the people had to pay for</text>
  <text start="141.38" dur="6.96">this and it put the entire Greek economy</text>
  <text start="145.299" dur="6.371">into a collapsed scenario where</text>
  <text start="148.34" dur="5.07">unemployment went up by you know twenty</text>
  <text start="151.67" dur="4.68">five percent or so youth unemployment</text>
  <text start="153.41" dur="7.02">went up over forty percent and it was a</text>
  <text start="156.35" dur="7.139">complete disaster in Greece and we can</text>
  <text start="160.43" dur="5.91">see as Greece continually accepted more</text>
  <text start="163.489" dur="6.991">and more debt and they implemented</text>
  <text start="166.34" dur="8.16">austerity the situation can improve it</text>
  <text start="170.48" dur="7.08">actually got worse because debt is the</text>
  <text start="174.5" dur="6.75">problem and the country had to then sell</text>
  <text start="177.56" dur="5.22">off their actual assets</text>
  <text start="181.25" dur="3.87">for pennies on the dollar to these</text>
  <text start="182.78" dur="5.13">creditors but this is what central</text>
  <text start="185.12" dur="6.21">bank&amp;#39;s actually want and we can see</text>
  <text start="187.91" dur="5.37">right now in Australia well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="191.33" dur="3.93">coming to a place where the United</text>
  <text start="193.28" dur="7.89">States was back in two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="195.26" dur="10.62">and they&amp;#39;re looking to help the everyday</text>
  <text start="201.17" dur="6.63">person with purchasing real estate now</text>

  <text start="212.18" dur="8.279">loans and this new proposal is called a</text>
  <text start="216.62" dur="7.7">creative idea now i don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="220.459" dur="8.671">what&amp;#39;s creative about this zero down</text>
  <text start="224.32" dur="7.419">bringing in subprime people this was</text>
  <text start="229.13" dur="6.72">already tried in the US and what</text>
  <text start="231.739" dur="6.511">happened it was a complete disaster so</text>
  <text start="235.85" dur="4.88">zero percent down loans depend on</text>
  <text start="238.25" dur="5.94">several things home prices keep rising</text>
  <text start="240.73" dur="5.8">buyers keep their jobs and interest</text>
  <text start="244.19" dur="5.519">rates mortgage payments rise lower than</text>
  <text start="246.53" dur="8.22">income and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="249.709" dur="7.761">this is not really happening but what we</text>
  <text start="254.75" dur="5.54">can tell is that the central bankers</text>
  <text start="257.47" dur="5.23">they&amp;#39;re trying to keep the system alive</text>
  <text start="260.29" dur="4.39">while everything is contracting and</text>
  <text start="262.7" dur="4.05">remember something very important about</text>
  <text start="264.68" dur="5.31">all of this the central bankers can</text>
  <text start="266.75" dur="7.2">create money currency i should say the</text>
  <text start="269.99" dur="6.78">central bankers can use covert QE all</text>
  <text start="273.95" dur="6.27">over the place by treasury bonds pump up</text>
  <text start="276.77" dur="5.399">the stock market keep the illusion alive</text>
  <text start="280.22" dur="4.38">have the government you know fake the</text>
  <text start="282.169" dur="5.551">statistical numbers they can do all that</text>
  <text start="284.6" dur="7.5">it sounds great but the heart of the</text>
  <text start="287.72" dur="8.18">economy that doesn&amp;#39;t reflect on what</text>
  <text start="292.1" dur="7.59">they&amp;#39;re doing the heart of the economy</text>
  <text start="295.9" dur="6.19">shows what&amp;#39;s really happening and this</text>
  <text start="299.69" dur="5.97">is the the problem of the central bank</text>
  <text start="302.09" dur="8.28">they could never get people to spend</text>
  <text start="305.66" dur="7.62">their money their currency no matter</text>
  <text start="310.37" dur="4.42">what they do with the statistics no</text>
  <text start="313.28" dur="4.75">matter what they do with the stock</text>
  <text start="314.79" dur="5.7">market no matter how much they print up</text>
  <text start="318.03" dur="5.6">it makes no difference that&amp;#39;s their</text>
  <text start="320.49" dur="5.22">biggest downfall and when the consumer</text>
  <text start="323.63" dur="4.57">stops spending because yet to remember</text>
  <text start="325.71" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s like 71 percent of GDP once the</text>
  <text start="328.2" dur="5.4">consumers stop spending this is a</text>
  <text start="330" dur="7.26">problem because this whole entire system</text>
  <text start="333.6" dur="9.33">is based on people spending money taking</text>
  <text start="337.26" dur="10.62">out loans buying things and we can see</text>
  <text start="342.93" dur="7.95">just in retail that this is taking a</text>
  <text start="347.88" dur="6.98">toll because people don&amp;#39;t have the jobs</text>
  <text start="350.88" dur="6.27">they had before wages are declining</text>
  <text start="354.86" dur="4.39">people don&amp;#39;t have the full time job</text>
  <text start="357.15" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re taking part time jobs we see</text>
  <text start="359.25" dur="4.62">Macy&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re going to close another 34</text>
  <text start="361.02" dur="7.8">stores because profits are falling</text>
  <text start="363.87" dur="9.69">nearly thirteen percent because sales</text>
  <text start="368.82" dur="7.95">are declining Walmart their sales are</text>
  <text start="373.56" dur="6.24">declining they just had a miss toys r us</text>
  <text start="376.77" dur="7.56">they laid off up to fifteen percent in</text>
  <text start="379.8" dur="8.13">their headquarters why because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="384.33" dur="9.45">struggling financially the traffic is</text>
  <text start="387.93" dur="8.64">not their sales aren&amp;#39;t there this is why</text>
  <text start="393.78" dur="6.45">we see retail stores closing left and</text>

  <text start="400.23" dur="5.43">products online they all have websites</text>
  <text start="402.69" dur="5.52">they all have a presence online but the</text>
  <text start="405.66" dur="4.68">problem is the people aren&amp;#39;t spending</text>
  <text start="408.21" dur="5.25">the money this is why they&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="410.34" dur="5.07">push universal basic income now of</text>

  <text start="415.41" dur="2.76">when the gas prices came down they</text>
  <text start="417" dur="2.34">thought everyone&amp;#39;s going to have this</text>
  <text start="418.17" dur="3.51">extra money they&amp;#39;re going to go out to</text>
  <text start="419.34" dur="4.59">retail and spend like crazy it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
