  <text start="163.959" dur="5.071">before then in January and this is</text>
  <text start="166.84" dur="3.78">exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="169.03" dur="3.239">to see everything start to break down</text>
  <text start="170.62" dur="3.929">we&amp;#39;re starting to hear that retail</text>
  <text start="172.269" dur="4.381">stores aren&amp;#39;t doing well the holiday</text>
  <text start="174.549" dur="4.53">season wasn&amp;#39;t that great we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="176.65" dur="5.91">to see inflation tick up right now the</text>
  <text start="179.079" dur="6.011">Fed warns inflation has arrived we see</text>
  <text start="182.56" dur="5.35">the Philadelphia the New York Fed the</text>
  <text start="185.09" dur="4.41">prices have soared and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="187.91" dur="3.21">see that inflation is starting to tick</text>
  <text start="189.5" dur="4.319">up now what&amp;#39;s going to happen here is</text>
  <text start="191.12" dur="6.27">that the central banking system they</text>
  <text start="193.819" dur="5.041">want inflation and when inflation hits</text>
  <text start="197.39" dur="4.349">they&amp;#39;re not going to be able to control</text>
  <text start="198.86" dur="4.769">it it&amp;#39;s gonna get out of control and all</text>
  <text start="201.739" dur="3.241">of a sudden they&amp;#39;re gonna try to control</text>
  <text start="203.629" dur="4.11">it and it&amp;#39;s going to get worse and worse</text>
  <text start="204.98" dur="6.78">as time goes on now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="207.739" dur="5.881">a surge in the regional feds and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="211.76" dur="5.13">starting to see that the prices paid</text>
  <text start="213.62" dur="5.97">index the clearest indicator of input</text>
  <text start="216.89" dur="5.25">cost inflation which in the New York Fed</text>
  <text start="219.59" dur="4.739">surged by thirty six point two two forty</text>
  <text start="222.14" dur="5.31">eight point six this is the highest in</text>
  <text start="224.329" dur="6.481">six years and what we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="227.45" dur="6.09">is that all of this is happening at once</text>
  <text start="230.81" dur="7.2">now while all this is happening in the</text>
  <text start="233.54" dur="6.69">economy is breaking down we see that the</text>
  <text start="238.01" dur="5.4">central banks they&amp;#39;re trying to control</text>
  <text start="240.23" dur="5.039">the system now eventually what they want</text>
  <text start="243.41" dur="3.06">to do is they trying to control the</text>
  <text start="245.269" dur="2.851">blockchain they&amp;#39;re trying to drive</text>
  <text start="246.47" dur="4.53">everyone away from Bitcoin and other</text>
  <text start="248.12" dur="5.85">cryptocurrencies while they push forth</text>
  <text start="251" dur="6.78">their system now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="253.97" dur="7.71">is that ripple is going to work in the</text>
  <text start="257.78" dur="7.68">banking system of the oil-rich Kingdom</text>
  <text start="261.68" dur="6.93">of Saudi Arabia now Saudi Arabia and</text>
  <text start="265.46" dur="6.9">ripple the company behind the XRP coin</text>
  <text start="268.61" dur="5.55">will cooperate using X current software</text>
  <text start="272.36" dur="4.05">that enables banks to instantly settle</text>
  <text start="274.16" dur="4.59">cross-border payments with end and</text>
  <text start="276.41" dur="5.129">tracking central banks around the world</text>
  <text start="278.75" dur="5.099">are leaning into blockchain technology</text>
  <text start="281.539" dur="4.621">and recognition of how it can transform</text>
  <text start="283.849" dur="4.531">cross-border payments resulting in lower</text>
  <text start="286.16" dur="4.91">barriers to trade and commerce for both</text>
  <text start="288.38" dur="5.52">corporates and consumers the Saudi</text>
  <text start="291.07" dur="5.8">central bank will be the first to use</text>
  <text start="293.9" dur="5.67">ripples blockchain network ripple is</text>
  <text start="296.87" dur="4.859">being traded as a crypto currency but it</text>
  <text start="299.57" dur="4.83">is more of a token than a digit than</text>
  <text start="301.729" dur="4.981">digital money it peaked at 3 dollars and</text>
  <text start="304.4" dur="4.98">31 cents in January but is training</text>
  <text start="306.71" dur="5.69">around a dollar 15 this week the idea of</text>
  <text start="309.38" dur="6.12">the token is to act as a bridge between</text>
  <text start="312.4" dur="5.29">international bank transactions not to</text>
  <text start="315.5" dur="3.539">become an alternative for fiat</text>
  <text start="317.69" dur="3.119">currencies</text>
  <text start="319.039" dur="4.38">and what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is</text>
  <text start="320.809" dur="4.651">they&amp;#39;re testing this out and eventually</text>
  <text start="323.419" dur="5.011">what is going to happen is they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="325.46" dur="6.03">to push their agenda because you have to</text>
  <text start="328.43" dur="4.769">remember the crypto market that competes</text>
  <text start="331.49" dur="3.179">against them they&amp;#39;re very afraid of it</text>
  <text start="333.199" dur="3.69">this is why they&amp;#39;ve been demonizing it</text>
  <text start="334.669" dur="4.17">and we can see right now that everything</text>
  <text start="336.889" dur="4.59">is starting to accelerate we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="338.839" dur="4.29">to see the economy come down and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="341.479" dur="3.33">talking about the stock market the</text>
  <text start="343.129" dur="3.451">manipulate these numbers none of that</text>
  <text start="344.809" dur="6.48">kind of stuff we&amp;#39;re talking about the</text>
  <text start="346.58" dur="6.75">real people&amp;#39;s economy where the central</text>
  <text start="351.289" dur="4.02">bank&amp;#39;s really don&amp;#39;t have that much</text>
  <text start="353.33" dur="4.29">control they can&amp;#39;t control what people</text>
  <text start="355.309" dur="5.491">spend they can&amp;#39;t control the people have</text>
  <text start="357.62" dur="6.329">jobs all they can do is control on how</text>
  <text start="360.8" dur="5.579">people borrow and how much debt they can</text>
  <text start="363.949" dur="5.131">get into that&amp;#39;s all they can do they can</text>
  <text start="366.379" dur="6.18">prop up the banks yes of course but they</text>
  <text start="369.08" dur="6.03">can&amp;#39;t really do that much and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="372.559" dur="4.11">seeing right now is they realize and</text>
  <text start="375.11" dur="3.449">they understand that the economy can</text>
  <text start="376.669" dur="3.9">only last for so long before the whole</text>
  <text start="378.559" dur="4.1">thing starts to fall apart and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="380.569" dur="4.981">exactly what they&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="382.659" dur="4.72">everything is starting to fall apart and</text>
  <text start="385.55" dur="4.739">I&amp;#39;m talking about the actual economy</text>
  <text start="387.379" dur="5.551">just like in 2008 where everything was</text>
  <text start="390.289" dur="5.041">falling apart before the market came</text>
  <text start="392.93" dur="4.44">down they knew it was happening they</text>
  <text start="395.33" dur="3.959">kind of kicked it off by raising</text>
  <text start="397.37" dur="2.939">interest rates and they&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="399.289" dur="4.201">same thing right now</text>
  <text start="400.309" dur="5.4">and as we move into this phase we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="403.49" dur="3.63">gonna see a lot of chaos around the</text>
  <text start="405.709" dur="3.06">world it&amp;#39;s not just going to be with the</text>
  <text start="407.12" dur="4.259">economy because everything is tied into</text>
  <text start="408.769" dur="4.02">it think about what is happening out in</text>
  <text start="411.379" dur="5.52">the Middle East with the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="412.789" dur="7.23">and how the system was built and how its</text>
  <text start="416.899" dur="6.961">sustained all of it is coming down now</text>
  <text start="420.019" dur="5.911">because their agenda to capture all of</text>
  <text start="423.86" dur="5.669">these countries and keep everyone using</text>
  <text start="425.93" dur="5.4">the petro dollar it did not work and we</text>
  <text start="429.529" dur="3.69">mentioned this many many times before</text>
  <text start="431.33" dur="3.989">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that all of</text>
  <text start="433.219" dur="4.68">this is starting to come true where</text>
  <text start="435.319" dur="5.37">there are countries now moving away from</text>
  <text start="437.899" dur="5.07">the dollar they&amp;#39;re moving into either</text>
  <text start="440.689" dur="3.96">crypto currencies or into their own</text>
  <text start="442.969" dur="4.29">currency or they&amp;#39;re trading with China</text>
  <text start="444.649" dur="4.471">and Russia using their currency but we</text>
  <text start="447.259" dur="5.601">can see right now everything is being</text>
  <text start="449.12" dur="8.04">moved away from the dollar that</text>
  <text start="452.86" dur="6.28">eventually will be toxic to many</text>
  <text start="457.16" dur="3.48">different countries and they won&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="459.14" dur="2.88">want to deal with it and I know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="460.64" dur="4.17">many people saying no the dollars gonna</text>
  <text start="462.02" dur="6.48">last forever it&amp;#39;s always gonna be here</text>
  <text start="464.81" dur="5.31">well nothing lasts forever and if you</text>
  <text start="468.5" dur="4.92">look at all the other reserve currencies</text>
  <text start="470.12" dur="5.88">in the past they don&amp;#39;t exist today and</text>
  <text start="473.42" dur="3.9">if you go back further than that the</text>
  <text start="476" dur="3.3">currencies the paper currencies that</text>
  <text start="477.32" dur="4.71">they had back then they don&amp;#39;t even exist</text>
  <text start="479.3" dur="5.58">today yes there will be some type of</text>
  <text start="482.03" dur="5.22">dollar but it won&amp;#39;t be the dollar that</text>
  <text start="484.88" dur="4.44">we know it won&amp;#39;t be the petrodollar you</text>
  <text start="487.25" dur="3.96">might even say Federal Reserve on it but</text>
  <text start="489.32" dur="6.06">when everything is said and done it</text>
  <text start="491.21" dur="6.69">might say the United States Treasury it</text>
  <text start="495.38" dur="6.15">might say nothing because it might be</text>
  <text start="497.9" dur="6.87">electronic we are definitely moving into</text>
  <text start="501.53" dur="5.94">something completely different the</text>
  <text start="504.77" dur="5.58">central bankers have driven the global</text>
  <text start="507.47" dur="5.189">economy as far as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="510.35" dur="4.74">they knew eventually they were gonna</text>
  <text start="512.659" dur="4.171">have to do something they are hoping and</text>
  <text start="515.09" dur="3.72">this is what they were planning they</text>
  <text start="516.83" dur="4.709">were hoping to have a major event they</text>
  <text start="518.81" dur="5.94">were hoping to distract everyone this is</text>
  <text start="521.539" dur="5.971">what their plan was everything is up in</text>
  <text start="524.75" dur="5.52">the air now because they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="527.51" dur="4.74">ability to create a major major</text>
  <text start="530.27" dur="3.9">distraction to say this is why the</text>
  <text start="532.25" dur="5.88">economy came down so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="534.17" dur="6.419">reorganizing they&amp;#39;re taking their old</text>
  <text start="538.13" dur="4.8">plans replacing it with their new plans</text>
  <text start="540.589" dur="3.991">and they&amp;#39;re gonna go forward with that</text>
  <text start="542.93" dur="3.27">and we can see they&amp;#39;re already starting</text>
  <text start="544.58" dur="4.53">to do this with a lot of headlines</text>
  <text start="546.2" dur="5.25">saying that Trump owns the economy once</text>
  <text start="549.11" dur="4.5">the stock market came down its Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="551.45" dur="4.5">economy now and they keep putting these</text>
  <text start="553.61" dur="5.58">articles out there pushing that type of</text>
  <text start="555.95" dur="5.46">agenda and eventually probably in the</text>
  <text start="559.19" dur="5.85">next couple of months we&amp;#39;re gonna start</text>
  <text start="561.41" dur="5.31">to see extra crazy things happening in</text>
  <text start="565.04" dur="3.39">the economy and a lot of the corporate</text>
  <text start="566.72" dur="3.18">media is going to be out there and</text>
  <text start="568.43" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re gonna be pointing the finger at</text>
  <text start="569.9" dur="5.25">the Trump administration this has been</text>
  <text start="572.27" dur="5.67">planned because their original plans</text>
  <text start="575.15" dur="4.35">they can&amp;#39;t push anymore they can&amp;#39;t push</text>
  <text start="577.94" dur="3.84">stuff in North Korea they can&amp;#39;t push</text>

  <text start="584.39" dur="6.29">nothing left so they have to resume</text>
  <text start="586.56" dur="5.86">to blame all of this on the Trump</text>
  <text start="590.68" dur="4.14">administration because this is their</text>
  <text start="592.42" dur="3.84">only out at this point and yes we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="594.82" dur="3.84">gonna see other distractions and other</text>
  <text start="596.26" dur="4.38">things happen but there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="598.66" dur="4.41">battle between what system we end up</text>
  <text start="600.64" dur="4.11">with now hopefully we end up with a</text>
  <text start="603.07" dur="3.27">system that&amp;#39;s outside of the central</text>
  <text start="604.75" dur="5.4">bank where the central bank no longer</text>
  <text start="606.34" dur="5.94">exists but if we don&amp;#39;t well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="610.15" dur="5.04">gonna control the entire situation</text>
