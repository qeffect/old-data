  <text start="48.6" dur="4.5">economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="51.239" dur="5.941">we&amp;#39;re getting more and more information</text>
  <text start="53.1" dur="7.44">about retail and retail is not doing as</text>
  <text start="57.18" dur="5.58">well as everyone thinks it is and more</text>
  <text start="60.54" dur="4.769">and more stores now are reporting in and</text>
  <text start="62.76" dur="7.46">we&amp;#39;re starting to see a pattern Grove</text>
  <text start="65.309" dur="7.741">where all the sales are declining j.crew</text>
  <text start="70.22" dur="4.71">they reported in and they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="73.05" dur="3.99">a decline of seven percent last quarter</text>
  <text start="74.93" dur="5.95">Sierra&amp;#39;s saying their first quarter loss</text>
  <text start="77.04" dur="6.86">is much worse than they thought and we</text>
  <text start="80.88" dur="6.51">see Kmart is also included in this and</text>
  <text start="83.9" dur="6.009">when we look at the entire retail sector</text>
  <text start="87.39" dur="6.72">right now we&amp;#39;re seeing store after store</text>
  <text start="89.909" dur="6.211">after store decline in sales the best</text>
  <text start="94.11" dur="4.68">buy right now is saying that their</text>
  <text start="96.12" dur="4.53">revenue has slid and we&amp;#39;re seeing about</text>
  <text start="98.79" dur="4.47">an eight percent decline internationally</text>
  <text start="100.65" dur="6.27">and they&amp;#39;ve closed many different stores</text>
  <text start="103.26" dur="6.6">they&amp;#39;ve closed the super stores and some</text>
  <text start="106.92" dur="4.62">best buy mobile locations to help out</text>
  <text start="109.86" dur="3.66">with their sales to help out with the</text>
  <text start="111.54" dur="4.53">revenue and we see this happening a lot</text>
  <text start="113.52" dur="5.85">in retail where they&amp;#39;re letting go a lot</text>
  <text start="116.07" dur="6.3">of people they&amp;#39;re closing stores to try</text>
  <text start="119.37" dur="5.07">to boost the image that retail is still</text>
  <text start="122.37" dur="3.3">working and everything is okay but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="124.44" dur="3.51">starting to see that this is further</text>
  <text start="125.67" dur="3.869">from the truth everything is continually</text>
  <text start="127.95" dur="3.509">declining and this is because the people</text>
  <text start="129.539" dur="5.461">they just don&amp;#39;t have the funds to go out</text>
  <text start="131.459" dur="5.28">and start to purchase the goods and we</text>
  <text start="135" dur="2.97">can see right now from all these layoffs</text>
  <text start="136.739" dur="2.851">that are coming down the pike and all</text>
  <text start="137.97" dur="3.95">the layoffs that have come down the pike</text>
  <text start="139.59" dur="5.429">it&amp;#39;s getting worse and worse out there</text>
  <text start="141.92" dur="5.02">now it&amp;#39;s very odd about all of this is</text>
  <text start="145.019" dur="3.811">the corporate media and the US</text>
  <text start="146.94" dur="3.39">government through manipulation they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="148.83" dur="3.75">trying to convince everyone that of</text>
  <text start="150.33" dur="4.2">course retail is okay and also actually</text>
  <text start="152.58" dur="5.01">retail doesn&amp;#39;t even matter in the</text>
  <text start="154.53" dur="6.329">economy anymore and housing is just</text>
  <text start="157.59" dur="6.3">booming now I looked around the country</text>
  <text start="160.859" dur="6.481">and let me tell you housing prices</text>
  <text start="163.89" dur="7.29">are dropping houses are on the market</text>
  <text start="167.34" dur="5.58">longer and longer and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="171.18" dur="4.02">can&amp;#39;t even tell I went around the</text>
  <text start="172.92" dur="3.69">neighborhood where I am and I started</text>
  <text start="175.2" dur="3.66">talking to people that have their houses</text>
  <text start="176.61" dur="3.84">for sale and I asked them how long do</text>
  <text start="178.86" dur="2.97">they have them for sale and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="180.45" dur="2.52">saying there&amp;#39;s no traffic whatsoever the</text>
  <text start="181.83" dur="3.36">Realtors don&amp;#39;t understand what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="182.97" dur="3.81">on there scratching their heads and the</text>
  <text start="185.19" dur="2.97">real the realtors are just continually</text>
  <text start="186.78" dur="3.51">saying drop the price drop the price</text>
  <text start="188.16" dur="5.1">dropped the price and this reminds me of</text>
  <text start="190.29" dur="5.31">prior to 2008 when the Realtors had no</text>
  <text start="193.26" dur="3.93">idea what was going on but today we had</text>
  <text start="195.6" dur="3.51">pending home sales and remember pending</text>
  <text start="197.19" dur="3.75">home sales doesn&amp;#39;t mean the sale has</text>
  <text start="199.11" dur="5.19">gone through people filled out</text>
  <text start="200.94" dur="5.549">applications they want to purchase their</text>
  <text start="204.3" dur="4.65">pending doesn&amp;#39;t mean they follow through</text>
  <text start="206.489" dur="5.581">and this is a very easy way to</text>
  <text start="208.95" dur="7.11">manipulate the housing market and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="212.07" dur="6">sword by 5.1 percent so people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="216.06" dur="4.53">out there purchasing goods in retail</text>
  <text start="218.07" dur="3.81">stores retail stores are declining more</text>
  <text start="220.59" dur="3.92">and more people are losing jobs but</text>
  <text start="221.88" dur="5.88">everyone&amp;#39;s out there purchasing homes</text>
  <text start="224.51" dur="6.58">you see the problem with this it makes</text>
  <text start="227.76" dur="4.91">no sense now of course when we</text>
  <text start="231.09" dur="4.86">continually look at this we see that</text>
  <text start="232.67" dur="6.01">there are major major problems remember</text>
  <text start="235.95" dur="5.52">the central bankers the United States</text>
  <text start="238.68" dur="5.309">government they report on the cities</text>
  <text start="241.47" dur="5.19">that they can control the areas that</text>
  <text start="243.989" dur="4.261">they created the bubbles and remember</text>
  <text start="246.66" dur="3.75">they have a lot of hedge funds a lot of</text>
  <text start="248.25" dur="5.25">investment companies a lot of foreign</text>
  <text start="250.41" dur="5.1">investors who are pouring in the free</text>
  <text start="253.5" dur="4.169">money to purchase and gobble up all</text>
  <text start="255.51" dur="4.05">these houses now of course doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="257.669" dur="4.621">anyone living in them they rent them if</text>
  <text start="259.56" dur="4.65">they can but they&amp;#39;re told to hold on to</text>
  <text start="262.29" dur="3.84">them and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing now</text>
  <text start="264.21" dur="4.14">the American people they&amp;#39;re sitting on</text>
  <text start="266.13" dur="5.61">the sidelines today they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="268.35" dur="5.58">involved and as we go throughout this</text>
  <text start="271.74" dur="5.67">summer because remember the summer is</text>
  <text start="273.93" dur="5.7">the hot time no pun intended there for</text>
  <text start="277.41" dur="3.89">real estate this is when they make the</text>
  <text start="279.63" dur="5.07">sales because everyone wants to get in</text>
  <text start="281.3" dur="4.78">before school starts of course during</text>
  <text start="284.7" dur="3.12">the summer makes it a lot easier to move</text>
  <text start="286.08" dur="3.24">because it&amp;#39;s warmer weather nicer</text>
  <text start="287.82" dur="3.09">weather and you don&amp;#39;t have to worry</text>
  <text start="289.32" dur="3.87">about snow you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about</text>
  <text start="290.91" dur="3.689">the cold you have to worry about ice now</text>
  <text start="293.19" dur="3.12">when we go throughout this year just</text>
  <text start="294.599" dur="3.09">like we did last year we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="296.31" dur="4.8">that sales</text>
  <text start="297.689" dur="5.04">don&amp;#39;t go anywhere and when we look at</text>
  <text start="301.11" dur="3.5">the graph and we step back and we look</text>
  <text start="302.729" dur="4.44">at this actually it&amp;#39;s a flat line</text>
  <text start="304.61" dur="5.139">they&amp;#39;re just keeping it steady and</text>
  <text start="307.169" dur="6.66">making everyone believe that everything</text>
  <text start="309.749" dur="6.06">is ok now core durable goods they have</text>
  <text start="313.829" dur="3.21">tumbled by point eight percent month a</text>
  <text start="315.809" dur="4.62">month and six point seven percent</text>
  <text start="317.039" dur="7.321">year-on-year down 15 of the last 18</text>
  <text start="320.429" dur="7.44">months however they we did some</text>
  <text start="324.36" dur="7.049">revisions across the entire time series</text>
  <text start="327.869" dur="6.87">and all of a sudden they added in a lot</text>
  <text start="331.409" dur="7.59">more military spending and non-defense</text>
  <text start="334.739" dur="8.04">aircraft and that pushed core durable</text>
  <text start="338.999" dur="5.52">goods up to make it look like everything</text>
  <text start="342.779" dur="3.78">is fine and of course you see it all</text>
  <text start="344.519" dur="4.04">over the corporate media and they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="346.559" dur="4.71">there saying that look this is fantastic</text>
  <text start="348.559" dur="5.26">durable goods it&amp;#39;s doing well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="351.269" dur="5.25">seeing a return of the economy</text>
  <text start="353.819" dur="7.05">everything is fine no everything is not</text>
  <text start="356.519" dur="8.33">fine they&amp;#39;re manipulating the numbers to</text>
  <text start="360.869" dur="7.44">make it look like everyone is out there</text>
  <text start="364.849" dur="8.261">purchasing and if we go back to June of</text>
  <text start="368.309" dur="7.35">2014 we saw non-defense aircraft the new</text>
  <text start="373.11" dur="5.699">waters back in June 2014 it just</text>
  <text start="375.659" dur="7.38">skyrocketed and then boom it fell right</text>
  <text start="378.809" dur="7.52">back to where it was after that it&amp;#39;s put</text>
  <text start="383.039" dur="5.73">into place to make everyone believe that</text>
  <text start="386.329" dur="5.7">everything is fine they did it once</text>
  <text start="388.769" dur="7.531">again today to make it look like</text>
  <text start="392.029" dur="6.85">everything is okay we see the Baltic Dry</text>
  <text start="396.3" dur="7.109">Index it is fallen by four points it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="398.879" dur="8.61">down to 601 and we see right now that as</text>
  <text start="403.409" dur="6.66">we move forward as the economy</text>
  <text start="407.489" dur="5.85">continually slides and declines and</text>
  <text start="410.069" dur="4.59">implodes on itself the US government the</text>
  <text start="413.339" dur="3.33">central bankers are going to continually</text>
  <text start="414.659" dur="5.4">come out and try to manipulate as much</text>
  <text start="416.669" dur="5.43">as they possibly can to keep everyone in</text>
  <text start="420.059" dur="3.57">the dark to make everyone believe that</text>
  <text start="422.099" dur="3.48">everything is fine just like we reported</text>
  <text start="423.629" dur="4.77">on Europe where they&amp;#39;re using the same</text>
  <text start="425.579" dur="6.001">exact practices of the unemployment</text>
  <text start="428.399" dur="4.561">numbers this is why out in</text>
  <text start="431.58" dur="4.619">Europe the unemployment numbers have</text>
  <text start="432.96" dur="4.739">stayed steady I mean it&amp;#39;d be kind of</text>
  <text start="436.199" dur="3.801">ridiculous if they brought the numbers</text>
  <text start="437.699" dur="4.201">way way down and everyone had no job</text>
  <text start="440" dur="5.83">people would wake up and say wait</text>
  <text start="441.9" dur="5.85">something&amp;#39;s wrong here and we see here</text>
  <text start="445.83" dur="5.22">in the United States we see out in</text>
  <text start="447.75" dur="6.689">Europe everything is manipulated there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="451.05" dur="6.239">money printing all over the place banks</text>
  <text start="454.439" dur="6.181">are manipulating the gold the silver</text>
  <text start="457.289" dur="10.461">market the interest rates banks are</text>
  <text start="460.62" dur="9.93">failing everywhere and as time goes on</text>
  <text start="467.75" dur="7.509">this is going to continually happen</text>
  <text start="470.55" dur="8.97">that&amp;#39;s not going to stop and up until</text>
  <text start="475.259" dur="8.28">the very very end they will never admit</text>
  <text start="479.52" dur="6.509">there is a problem they&amp;#39;ll tell you that</text>
  <text start="483.539" dur="5.791">everything is fine even when you&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="486.029" dur="5.221">on the street and you need you know a</text>
  <text start="489.33" dur="3.48">hundred dollars to buy a loaf of bread</text>
  <text start="491.25" dur="6.33">they&amp;#39;re going to tell you everything is</text>
  <text start="492.81" dur="7.319">okay because what the government does is</text>
  <text start="497.58" dur="4.739">that they lie they can never tell you</text>
  <text start="500.129" dur="3.66">the truth they can never tell you what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="502.319" dur="5.011">really happening so they have to do lie</text>
  <text start="503.789" dur="6.271">after lie after lie for instance like</text>
  <text start="507.33" dur="5.399">Obamacare now we know this is not a</text>
  <text start="510.06" dur="4.229">benefit to the people we know this did</text>
  <text start="512.729" dur="5.19">not help the American people we know</text>
  <text start="514.289" dur="5.04">that the Congress the president and the</text>
  <text start="517.919" dur="3.151">rest of the government employees they</text>
  <text start="519.329" dur="3.63">exempted themselves from the insurance</text>
  <text start="521.07" dur="3.6">because they knew it wasn&amp;#39;t good they</text>
  <text start="522.959" dur="4.951">had something better but it was good</text>
  <text start="524.67" dur="5.159">enough for the people there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="527.91" dur="5.1">in Obamacare called the transition</text>
  <text start="529.829" dur="5.851">reinsurance program and it was designed</text>
  <text start="533.01" dur="5.04">as a three-year experiment to help guard</text>
  <text start="535.68" dur="4.46">against major premium hikes by</text>
  <text start="538.05" dur="4.92">offsetting the high costs to insurers of</text>
  <text start="540.14" dur="6.49">providing health care coverage to the</text>
  <text start="542.97" dur="5.67">least healthy Americans and what it</text>
  <text start="546.63" dur="3.54">supposed to do it&amp;#39;s supposed to smooth</text>
  <text start="548.64" dur="5.189">out the losses for insurance companies</text>
  <text start="550.17" dur="6.359">operating in Obamacare so when those</text>
  <text start="553.829" dur="5.551">insurance companies didn&amp;#39;t do so well</text>
  <text start="556.529" dur="5.611">may lost money they would receive these</text>
  <text start="559.38" dur="6.13">funds if they did very well they would</text>
  <text start="562.14" dur="6.25">give back some funds to this and</text>
  <text start="565.51" dur="7.83">insurance program but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="568.39" dur="9.06">right now is that this TRP it&amp;#39;s paying</text>
  <text start="573.34" dur="7.23">out more than it&amp;#39;s taking in because</text>
  <text start="577.45" dur="8.01">what is happening is that Obamacare is a</text>
  <text start="580.57" dur="8.37">complete failure and there are billions</text>
  <text start="585.46" dur="5.43">about 15 billion already that has been</text>
  <text start="588.94" dur="3.59">paid out to insurance companies now</text>
  <text start="590.89" dur="4.83">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all this</text>
  <text start="592.53" dur="6.1">when a company here in the United States</text>
  <text start="595.72" dur="6.41">that is privately owned when it loses</text>
  <text start="598.63" dur="8.45">money does the government step in and</text>
  <text start="602.13" dur="8.56">make the difference up in their losses</text>
  <text start="607.08" dur="7.09">no and I&amp;#39;m not talking about GM I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="610.69" dur="5.01">talking about the major banks that are</text>
  <text start="614.17" dur="4.32">all intertwined in the government I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="615.7" dur="6.35">talking about a small company 25 50</text>
  <text start="618.49" dur="6.33">people 100 people know those companies</text>
  <text start="622.05" dur="5.53">it&amp;#39;s their responsibility it&amp;#39;s either</text>
  <text start="624.82" dur="5.76">they make sales they bring in revenue or</text>
  <text start="627.58" dur="5.64">they go bankrupt but the insurance</text>
  <text start="630.58" dur="4.5">companies who signed on to this and you</text>
  <text start="633.22" dur="4.26">have to remember what they did is they</text>
  <text start="635.08" dur="6.63">thought listen we&amp;#39;ll get every single</text>
  <text start="637.48" dur="6.68">American using Obamacare will be able to</text>
  <text start="641.71" dur="4.59">raise the premiums to whatever we want</text>
  <text start="644.16" dur="4.27">makes no difference because there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="646.3" dur="4.59">more competition we&amp;#39;re all in this</text>
  <text start="648.43" dur="5.69">together and the government with their</text>
  <text start="650.89" dur="5.52">penalties that people have no choice</text>
  <text start="654.12" dur="4.18">because if they didn&amp;#39;t go if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="656.41" dur="3.66">go into the insurance will get penalized</text>
  <text start="658.3" dur="5.31">and they thought this was going to work</text>
  <text start="660.07" dur="7.14">and it it&amp;#39;s having the opposite effect</text>
  <text start="663.61" dur="5.94">because people just don&amp;#39;t have the funds</text>
  <text start="667.21" dur="3.84">to pay for this expensive insurance so</text>
  <text start="669.55" dur="4.17">what&amp;#39;s happening right now is the</text>
