  <text start="122.14" dur="5.64">see why they are doing all this and this</text>
  <text start="125.71" dur="5.76">is the whole point of it yes it is</text>

  <text start="237.7" dur="5.31">I did I think it was my second one that</text>
  <text start="240.76" dur="5.61">I did that a cyberattack event is</text>
  <text start="243.01" dur="6.77">imminent I noticed and there are</text>
  <text start="246.37" dur="7.52">patterns that the government</text>
  <text start="249.78" dur="7.329">continuously harps on one subject and</text>
  <text start="253.89" dur="6.37">continuously throws news out about</text>
  <text start="257.109" dur="5.251">something that they&amp;#39;re going to have an</text>
  <text start="260.26" dur="3.72">event on so here we&amp;#39;re seeing cyber</text>
  <text start="262.36" dur="3.15">attack cyber like the last year</text>
  <text start="263.98" dur="4.26">cybertek&amp;#39;s but now it&amp;#39;s starting to ramp</text>
  <text start="265.51" dur="5.46">up and there are officials and Obama</text>

  <text start="270.97" dur="7.34">know cyber threats against us ramping up</text>
  <text start="273.79" dur="4.52">Obama says and he goes on to talk about</text>
  <text start="279.21" dur="5.89">that he sees how you know some of these</text>
  <text start="282.4" dur="5.639">are our government sponsored summer</text>
  <text start="285.1" dur="3.97">state-sponsored and some are just by</text>
  <text start="288.039" dur="2.981">criminal</text>
  <text start="289.07" dur="4.14">and you know they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re gonna do</text>
  <text start="291.02" dur="5.54">something about this and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="293.21" dur="6.84">you know put some plans into action and</text>
  <text start="296.56" dur="6.25">for those countries you know like China</text>
  <text start="300.05" dur="5.01">you know he&amp;#39;s been telling them that you</text>
  <text start="302.81" dur="4.92">know these making it very clear that you</text>
  <text start="305.06" dur="5.52">know you need to stop this or this could</text>
  <text start="307.73" dur="6">be some type of cyber war and it goes on</text>
  <text start="310.58" dur="4.95">and on and on and basically we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="313.73" dur="4.41">leading up to one thing we&amp;#39;re leading up</text>
  <text start="315.53" dur="5.57">to some type of event because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="318.14" dur="6.45">trying to get this loss sista passed and</text>
  <text start="321.1" dur="8.5">they&amp;#39;re trying it&amp;#39;s been reintroduced</text>
  <text start="324.59" dur="7.32">into Congress they need this law passed</text>
  <text start="329.6" dur="7.05">the president already set up the</text>
  <text start="331.91" dur="6.54">executive orders for sista and they need</text>
  <text start="336.65" dur="5.03">this past and how they going to do this</text>
  <text start="338.45" dur="5.91">if they just can&amp;#39;t do it the normal way</text>
  <text start="341.68" dur="5.83">it&amp;#39;s supposed to be done where people</text>
  <text start="344.36" dur="5.94">vote on it they will scare Americans</text>
  <text start="347.51" dur="7.17">into forcing people to vote on it in</text>
  <text start="350.3" dur="7.59">their way and we might have an event</text>
  <text start="354.68" dur="6.18">just to get this passed or if it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="357.89" dur="5.76">pass we will see an event afterwards to</text>
  <text start="360.86" dur="4.44">get it passed and they do this over and</text>
  <text start="363.65" dur="4.62">over and over you&amp;#39;ll probably see a lot</text>
  <text start="365.3" dur="6.15">more cyber warnings and eventually the</text>
  <text start="368.27" dur="5.48">event will will occur and everyone will</text>
  <text start="371.45" dur="4.64">be like wow where did this come from</text>
  <text start="373.75" dur="4.45">especially those people who aren&amp;#39;t awake</text>
  <text start="376.09" dur="3.82">they I mean they&amp;#39;ve been hearing cyber</text>
  <text start="378.2" dur="4.5">attack and they&amp;#39;re trying to you know</text>
  <text start="379.91" dur="5.19">get it let it seep into your mind that</text>
  <text start="382.7" dur="4.02">something will happen and these people</text>
  <text start="385.1" dur="3.06">will finally you know when they hear</text>
  <text start="386.72" dur="3.99">about it like oh yeah I heard about that</text>
  <text start="388.16" dur="4.5">I heard about a cyber attack and yeah we</text>
  <text start="390.71" dur="3.72">need to do something about that we we</text>
  <text start="392.66" dur="3.66">need to stop these people and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.43" dur="6.21">what will happen it happens every single</text>
  <text start="396.32" dur="6.84">time there&amp;#39;s really never they met it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="400.64" dur="4.26">funny they never do anything different</text>
  <text start="403.16" dur="3.8">same thing with the shooting you heard</text>
  <text start="404.9" dur="5.21">all the shootings up to the main event</text>
  <text start="406.96" dur="5.62">now they&amp;#39;re trying to get the law passed</text>
  <text start="410.11" dur="5.29">with the Feinstein bill and all this</text>
  <text start="412.58" dur="6.27">other stuff and they&amp;#39;re having trouble</text>
  <text start="415.4" dur="5.67">getting this done so again there right</text>
  <text start="418.85" dur="3.75">now on the cyber attack but once they</text>
  <text start="421.07" dur="3.3">finish this event</text>
  <text start="422.6" dur="3.87">we&amp;#39;ll start moving on to the next event</text>
  <text start="424.37" dur="3.69">of probably another shooting because</text>
  <text start="426.47" dur="3.57">they need to get our guns they need it</text>
  <text start="428.06" dur="3.75">before everything go sour they need to</text>
  <text start="430.04" dur="5.22">get it they need to get everyone&amp;#39;s gone</text>
  <text start="431.81" dur="10.05">away from them to make us completely</text>
  <text start="435.26" dur="8.43">helpless during this crisis now another</text>
  <text start="441.86" dur="4.86">thing in the news i just found very</text>
  <text start="443.69" dur="5.28">interesting is that there was a little</text>
  <text start="446.72" dur="4.23">blurb out there today saying that you us</text>
  <text start="448.97" dur="4.59">retail sales climb one point one percent</text>
  <text start="450.95" dur="4.14">in February and economy and you know</text>
  <text start="453.56" dur="3.81">underneath and little writing it says</text>
  <text start="455.09" dur="5.22">higher gas prices fuel again but</text>
  <text start="457.37" dur="7.44">shoppers show resilience resilience to</text>
  <text start="460.31" dur="8.7">me it makes me laugh the reason I laugh</text>
  <text start="464.81" dur="8">is is you have to think back Walmart was</text>
  <text start="469.01" dur="8.99">telling everyone that sales are horrible</text>
  <text start="472.81" dur="7.81">retail stores like radio shack JC Penney</text>
  <text start="478" dur="6.22">best buy we&amp;#39;re telling you they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="480.62" dur="5.73">clowns and noble their claim stop there</text>
  <text start="484.22" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re closing hundreds and</text>
  <text start="486.35" dur="3.77">hundreds of stores and if you add them</text>
  <text start="488.27" dur="5.1">all up it&amp;#39;s probably in the thousands</text>
  <text start="490.12" dur="7.57">now retail sales are getting better</text>
  <text start="493.37" dur="8.25">that&amp;#39;s why stores are closing Walmart is</text>
  <text start="497.69" dur="7.14">telling you that sales are are poor or</text>
  <text start="501.62" dur="6.15">dismal but sales are getting better no</text>
  <text start="504.83" dur="5.52">gas prices went up gas prices were</text>
  <text start="507.77" dur="4.68">included in retail sales so people are</text>
  <text start="510.35" dur="4.999">paying more for gas so they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="512.45" dur="6.269">at the dollar amount saying oh look</text>
  <text start="515.349" dur="5.801">sales are increasing and everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="518.719" dur="5.191">looking better which is ridiculous I</text>
  <text start="521.15" dur="11.01">mean I mean they put a spin on</text>
  <text start="523.91" dur="9.84">everything out in the news and I it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="532.16" dur="4.35">very difficult when you look at</text>
  <text start="533.75" dur="7.31">everything and they just put these</text>
  <text start="536.51" dur="8.22">headlines out there like for instance</text>
  <text start="541.06" dur="7.48">and I mean like the cyber attack</text>
  <text start="544.73" dur="5.76">warnings or the shootings or sales or</text>
