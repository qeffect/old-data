  <text start="108.06" dur="6.78">financial news now we do realize that</text>
  <text start="110.84" dur="7.029">there there are two different agendas</text>
  <text start="114.84" dur="6.15">being played out here we have the Cabal</text>
  <text start="117.869" dur="5.131">wrapped up with the central banks which</text>
  <text start="120.99" dur="4.26">is the deep state we also have a trump</text>
  <text start="123" dur="4.67">administration and the corporate media</text>
  <text start="125.25" dur="5.28">is the mouthpiece of the deep state and</text>
  <text start="127.67" dur="4.78">the central bank system we see a change</text>
  <text start="130.53" dur="2.43">of guards we see Yellen is out from the</text>
  <text start="132.45" dur="2.28">Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="132.96" dur="5.79">she was the Federal Reserve Chairman and</text>
  <text start="134.73" dur="6.33">now we see Powell is in so everything is</text>
  <text start="138.75" dur="5.55">changing we also understand that Trump</text>
  <text start="141.06" dur="6.3">has Andrew Jackson hanging on his wall</text>
  <text start="144.3" dur="6.06">in the White House now this is done on</text>
  <text start="147.36" dur="5.82">purpose because Andrew Jackson was the</text>
  <text start="150.36" dur="7.29">president that got rid of the central</text>
  <text start="153.18" dur="8.54">banking system and we can see and I do</text>
  <text start="157.65" dur="7.8">believe that this is the real hidden</text>
  <text start="161.72" dur="6.58">agenda behind all of this is to get rid</text>
  <text start="165.45" dur="6.15">of the central bank or take control of</text>
  <text start="168.3" dur="6.06">the central bank or prove the central</text>
  <text start="171.6" dur="3.21">bank is not working for the American</text>
  <text start="174.36" dur="3.599">people</text>
  <text start="174.81" dur="5.91">now we&amp;#39;re going to discuss this a little</text>
  <text start="177.959" dur="4.831">bit later in this report but let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="180.72" dur="2.92">right into what is happening in the</text>
  <text start="182.79" dur="4.33">economy</text>
  <text start="183.64" dur="6.42">now last month in November us</text>
  <text start="187.12" dur="5.85">credit-card debt had just surpassed the</text>
  <text start="190.06" dur="6.12">previous all-time high hit in July 2008</text>
  <text start="192.97" dur="5.97">and that happened right before</text>
  <text start="196.18" dur="5.13">everything fell apart when Lehman filed</text>
  <text start="198.94" dur="6.57">for bankruptcy and things started to</text>
  <text start="201.31" dur="7.11">rapidly disintegrate today well we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="205.51" dur="4.74">passed that already December total</text>
  <text start="208.42" dur="4.38">consumer credit increased by less than</text>
  <text start="210.25" dur="5.37">expected 20 billion but it was still an</text>
  <text start="212.8" dur="6.3">impressive eighteen point five billion</text>
  <text start="215.62" dur="5.22">dollars of which 5.1 billion was credit</text>
  <text start="219.1" dur="3.63">card debt and thirteen point three</text>
  <text start="220.84" dur="4.83">billion non revolving or student loan</text>
  <text start="222.73" dur="4.83">auto loans more importantly with the</text>
  <text start="225.67" dur="4.53">latest 5.1 billion increase in revolving</text>
  <text start="227.56" dur="6.27">credit card debt the total is now one</text>
  <text start="230.2" dur="8.25">point zero to seven trillion the highest</text>
  <text start="233.83" dur="11.34">number on record higher than where we</text>
  <text start="238.45" dur="9.03">were prior to the 2008 crash and what we</text>
  <text start="245.17" dur="8.48">see right now is that the personal</text>
  <text start="247.48" dur="9.99">savings rate we are down to 2008 levels</text>
  <text start="253.65" dur="7.26">so we have credit card debt very high</text>
  <text start="257.47" dur="7.74">student loan debt very high savings rate</text>
  <text start="260.91" dur="6.78">plummeting now with the student loans we</text>
  <text start="265.21" dur="6.06">can see that the student loan bubble is</text>
  <text start="267.69" dur="5.95">continually getting larger it is</text>
  <text start="271.27" dur="4.44">bursting that right now record numbers</text>
  <text start="273.64" dur="3.87">of Americans are rolling in government</text>
  <text start="275.71" dur="3.69">subsidized student loan debt Forgiveness</text>
  <text start="277.51" dur="5.79">plans known as income driven repayment</text>
  <text start="279.4" dur="7.11">are on track to send the US student loan</text>
  <text start="283.3" dur="4.26">program into negative territory now this</text>
  <text start="286.51" dur="3.68">is coming from the Department of</text>
  <text start="287.56" dur="5.06">Education inspector general and the</text>
  <text start="290.19" dur="5.68">plans known as income driven repayment</text>
  <text start="292.62" dur="5.26">these are set monthly payments as a</text>
  <text start="295.87" dur="4.95">percentage of borrower&amp;#39;s earnings and</text>
  <text start="297.88" dur="4.95">typically forgive balances after 10 to</text>
  <text start="300.82" dur="3.69">25 years depending on the borrower&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.83" dur="4.53">career field and debt amounts and all</text>
  <text start="304.51" dur="5.79">that overall borrowers in income driven</text>
  <text start="307.36" dur="5.76">repayment will repay less than what they</text>
  <text start="310.3" dur="5.64">originally borrowed now think about this</text>
  <text start="313.12" dur="4.17">for a second they needed to modify the</text>
  <text start="315.94" dur="4.77">student loans</text>
  <text start="317.29" dur="4.92">for the students coming out of college</text>
  <text start="320.71" dur="3.93">because they could not find a</text>
  <text start="322.21" dur="5.97">high-paying job they couldn&amp;#39;t pay back</text>
  <text start="324.64" dur="6.36">anything so they had to modify the loans</text>
  <text start="328.18" dur="5.16">to make it easier for them to repay but</text>
  <text start="331" dur="7.47">they&amp;#39;re gonna pay back a lot less than</text>
  <text start="333.34" dur="7.44">they borrowed because the system is not</text>
  <text start="338.47" dur="4.59">working the way it&amp;#39;s supposed to be</text>
  <text start="340.78" dur="3.42">working it&amp;#39;s breaking down and what I</text>
  <text start="343.06" dur="2.58">mean by this even though the</text>
  <text start="344.2" dur="3.09">unemployment numbers around four point</text>
  <text start="345.64" dur="5.06">one percent it makes no difference</text>
  <text start="347.29" dur="6.51">because the jobs the quality of jobs</text>
  <text start="350.7" dur="4.45">it&amp;#39;s absolutely terrible and those</text>
  <text start="353.8" dur="2.88">individuals coming out of college</text>
  <text start="355.15" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re having a very difficult time</text>
  <text start="356.68" dur="3.99">finding those high-paying jobs they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="358.84" dur="4.32">getting part-time jobs and this is why</text>
  <text start="360.67" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;re seeing this now what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="363.16" dur="5.67">right now is nearly 40% of student loans</text>
  <text start="365.35" dur="5.43">taken out in 2004 may default by 2023</text>
  <text start="368.83" dur="4.23">according to the report by Brookings</text>
  <text start="370.78" dur="4.95">Institute and this is gonna go this is</text>
  <text start="373.06" dur="6.36">gonna blow past all previous project</text>
  <text start="375.73" dur="5.91">projections now approximately 5% of</text>
  <text start="379.42" dur="5.34">undergraduates took out private student</text>
  <text start="381.64" dur="6.06">loans in 2004 which swelled to 14% of</text>
  <text start="384.76" dur="4.77">undergraduates by 2008 now private</text>
  <text start="387.7" dur="4.38">student loans as opposed to federal</text>
  <text start="389.53" dur="4.74">student loans are unable to participate</text>
  <text start="392.08" dur="4.83">in income driven government repayment</text>
  <text start="394.27" dur="5.13">programs the federal student loan system</text>
  <text start="396.91" dur="6.54">had originally been projected to turn a</text>
  <text start="399.4" dur="7.02">profit of about 25 billion on all loans</text>
  <text start="403.45" dur="6.66">made up to September 30th 2015 however</text>
  <text start="406.42" dur="7.08">that number has been revised down to</text>
  <text start="410.11" dur="6.18">five billion so they were supposed to</text>
  <text start="413.5" dur="6.39">turn a profit of 25 billion it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="416.29" dur="6.66">revised down to five billion and this is</text>
  <text start="419.89" dur="5.6">according to the IG report the income</text>
  <text start="422.95" dur="6.78">driven repayment program alone will cost</text>
  <text start="425.49" dur="8.32">yes cost the government 11.5 billion in</text>
  <text start="429.73" dur="6.9">revenue now the data the data shows the</text>
  <text start="433.81" dur="4.83">total cost for all loans approaching an</text>
  <text start="436.63" dur="5.88">overall positive subsidy which translate</text>
  <text start="438.64" dur="6.81">to a net cost to taxpayers basically the</text>
  <text start="442.51" dur="6.06">program&amp;#39;s going into the red and what</text>
  <text start="445.45" dur="5.64">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that all of</text>
  <text start="448.57" dur="4.89">this is starting to fall apart and</text>
  <text start="451.09" dur="5.549">has been falling apart for quite a while</text>
  <text start="453.46" dur="6.15">and it&amp;#39;s not going to improve anytime</text>
  <text start="456.639" dur="6.301">soon because when you&amp;#39;re living in this</text>
  <text start="459.61" dur="5.07">illusionary world and you&amp;#39;re pretending</text>
  <text start="462.94" dur="4.14">that everyone has a job and everyone has</text>
  <text start="464.68" dur="5.07">a high-paying job and you&amp;#39;re pretending</text>
  <text start="467.08" dur="4.32">that the student loan problem doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="469.75" dur="3.36">exist and everyone&amp;#39;s paying back their</text>
  <text start="471.4" dur="4.049">loans even though they&amp;#39;re modifying</text>
  <text start="473.11" dur="4.14">everything to make it look like it we</text>
  <text start="475.449" dur="4.861">have this major problem now think about</text>
  <text start="477.25" dur="7.41">this student loans credit cards auto</text>
  <text start="480.31" dur="5.91">loans all built on an illusion people</text>
  <text start="484.66" dur="3.84">aren&amp;#39;t defaulting there are</text>
  <text start="486.22" dur="5.58">delinquencies there get there</text>
  <text start="488.5" dur="5.52">accelerating now over time it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="491.8" dur="6.24">worse and think about what Congress just</text>
  <text start="494.02" dur="6.6">did well we know there&amp;#39;s a tax cut Trump</text>
  <text start="498.04" dur="7.32">pushed through his tax plan but Congress</text>
  <text start="500.62" dur="7.89">just voted to increase spending by two</text>
  <text start="505.36" dur="3.75">hundred billion dollars how is this</text>
  <text start="508.51" dur="3.75">going to work</text>
  <text start="509.11" dur="6.54">it can&amp;#39;t now think about this for a</text>
  <text start="512.26" dur="5.909">second when Obama entered the White</text>
  <text start="515.65" dur="4.74">House the US national debt was over ten</text>
  <text start="518.169" dur="4.29">point six trillion dollars when he left</text>
  <text start="520.39" dur="4.889">the White House eight years later it was</text>
  <text start="522.459" dur="5.311">around 20 trillion dollars so during</text>
  <text start="525.279" dur="4.411">those eight years more than nine</text>
  <text start="527.77" dur="4.2">trillion dollars was added to the</text>
  <text start="529.69" dur="4.68">national debt but for the purpose of</text>
  <text start="531.97" dur="5.55">this example will round down to an even</text>
  <text start="534.37" dur="6.45">nine trillion when you divide nine</text>
  <text start="537.52" dur="5.009">trillion dollars by eight you get an</text>
  <text start="540.82" dur="3.69">average of about one point one to five</text>
  <text start="542.529" dur="4.591">trillion dollars that was added to the</text>
  <text start="544.51" dur="6.63">national debt per year during the Obama</text>
  <text start="547.12" dur="7.2">era dividing that figure by 365 you find</text>
  <text start="551.14" dur="5.4">that an average of three billion was</text>
  <text start="554.32" dur="4.139">added to the national debt every single</text>
  <text start="556.54" dur="5.85">day during the Obama administration and</text>
  <text start="558.459" dur="6.871">if you take that and you divide it by</text>
  <text start="562.39" dur="4.22">ours there are 24 hours in a day that</text>
  <text start="565.33" dur="4.89">means that there&amp;#39;s an average of about</text>
  <text start="566.61" dur="6.25">128 million which was stolen from our</text>
  <text start="570.22" dur="5.58">children and our grandchildren every</text>
  <text start="572.86" dur="6.3">single hour of every single day while</text>
  <text start="575.8" dur="7.14">Obama was president and we can see this</text>
  <text start="579.16" dur="5.76">is not changing it is continuing and we</text>
  <text start="582.94" dur="5.16">are seeing the debt continually moving</text>
  <text start="584.92" dur="5.909">and they can&amp;#39;t stop because if they stop</text>
  <text start="588.1" dur="5.699">borrowing everything comes crashing down</text>
  <text start="590.829" dur="5.581">in a split second and they know this</text>
  <text start="593.799" dur="6.21">they understand this and we also have to</text>
  <text start="596.41" dur="7.589">understand a lot of this currency that</text>
  <text start="600.009" dur="5.401">was borrowed it&amp;#39;s gone missing about 21</text>
  <text start="603.999" dur="3.36">trillion probably even more than that</text>
  <text start="605.41" dur="4.5">but that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;ve researched and</text>
  <text start="607.359" dur="5.371">this is what they found and we see we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="609.91" dur="5.25">heading into a major problem here the</text>
  <text start="612.73" dur="6.87">economy cannot be sustained the way it</text>
  <text start="615.16" dur="8.099">is and we see right now the whole hidden</text>
  <text start="619.6" dur="6.509">agenda behind all of this is one control</text>
  <text start="623.259" dur="4.89">the narrative of the entire story of how</text>
  <text start="626.109" dur="4.14">the economy is going to come down to</text>
  <text start="628.149" dur="4.29">prepare us for a transition and</text>
  <text start="630.249" dur="5.851">eventually get rid of the central bank</text>
  <text start="632.439" dur="5.971">now we know in the past there have these</text>
  <text start="636.1" dur="6.539">there have been individuals that have</text>
  <text start="638.41" dur="6.57">pushed a bill to audit the Fed and every</text>
  <text start="642.639" dur="4.98">time it has failed because you know we</text>
  <text start="644.98" dur="5.279">shouldn&amp;#39;t know what this private central</text>
  <text start="647.619" dur="3.861">bank is doing for the people of the</text>
  <text start="650.259" dur="3.39">United States it&amp;#39;s none of our business</text>
  <text start="651.48" dur="4.659">you know all we need to do is</text>
  <text start="653.649" dur="4.47">continually pay taxes for all the money</text>
  <text start="656.139" dur="4.23">that they created out of thin air which</text>
  <text start="658.119" dur="3.93">they attach interest to so we have no</text>
  <text start="660.369" dur="5.91">right to this well we do have a right to</text>
  <text start="662.049" dur="6.87">this if they&amp;#39;re handling the economy we</text>
  <text start="666.279" dur="6.39">should know what they&amp;#39;re doing with all</text>
  <text start="668.919" dur="5.76">this currency that they&amp;#39;re creating who</text>
  <text start="672.669" dur="4.741">they&amp;#39;re giving it to why they&amp;#39;ve given</text>
  <text start="674.679" dur="4.83">it that we should know all of it and we</text>
  <text start="677.41" dur="3.989">know that they&amp;#39;ve tried this before and</text>
  <text start="679.509" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s always been shot down why because</text>
  <text start="681.399" dur="4.41">the Fed it&amp;#39;s a private corporation they</text>
  <text start="684.189" dur="4.921">don&amp;#39;t want to be audited because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="685.809" dur="6.33">hiding things so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="689.11" dur="6.629">now is representative Tom Massey and</text>
  <text start="692.139" dur="6.12">Senator Rand Paul they have reintroduced</text>
  <text start="695.739" dur="5.31">the legislation to order the Fed now</text>
  <text start="698.259" dur="5.52">they tried this before with different</text>
  <text start="701.049" dur="6.45">Congress&amp;#39;s with different presidents but</text>
  <text start="703.779" dur="6.87">this time around we can see we have a</text>
  <text start="707.499" dur="6.18">different Fed president we have a</text>
  <text start="710.649" dur="8.191">different president and we have a</text>
  <text start="713.679" dur="8.221">different Congress now Trump is all for</text>
  <text start="718.84" dur="7.97">auditing the Fed he agrees with Rand</text>
  <text start="721.9" dur="9.33">Paul and we can see this time around</text>
  <text start="726.81" dur="7.27">this bill might get through I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="731.23" dur="5.13">saying it&amp;#39;s going to happen but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="734.08" dur="4.92">going to make an attempt now Congress is</text>
  <text start="736.36" dur="4.5">basically Republican right now Trump is</text>
  <text start="739" dur="3.75">on board with this Rand Paul knows this</text>
  <text start="740.86" dur="6.21">and I believe this is the beginning</text>
  <text start="742.75" dur="5.97">stages of trying to bring down the</text>
  <text start="747.07" dur="3.93">central bank and you have to start</text>
  <text start="748.72" dur="6.6">someplace you need to have this bill</text>
  <text start="751" dur="6.72">passed so you can audit to find out what</text>
  <text start="755.32" dur="6.06">they have been doing and expose the</text>
  <text start="757.72" dur="7.74">Federal Reserve to the country to show</text>
  <text start="761.38" dur="6.18">that they were up to no good and you</text>
  <text start="765.46" dur="3.87">have to start very slowly you need to</text>
  <text start="767.56" dur="3.24">start a little bit at a time just like</text>
  <text start="769.33" dur="3.54">what the FISA memo and everything else</text>
  <text start="770.8" dur="4.74">you just can&amp;#39;t come out and say hey</text>
  <text start="772.87" dur="5.37">let&amp;#39;s get rid of them because what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="775.54" dur="5.22">reasoning for it I mean yes we know the</text>
  <text start="778.24" dur="4.289">reasons but most of America does not so</text>
  <text start="780.76" dur="3.21">a little bit at a time and I think this</text>
  <text start="782.529" dur="3.81">is the hidden agenda this is why Andrew</text>
  <text start="783.97" dur="5.13">Jackson is hanging on the wall in the</text>
  <text start="786.339" dur="8.791">White House because their main agenda</text>
  <text start="789.1" dur="9">the main agenda is to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="795.13" dur="6.72">central bank because the central bank is</text>
  <text start="798.1" dur="6.48">the root of all evil what they have done</text>
  <text start="801.85" dur="4.29">to our country it they have destroyed it</text>
  <text start="804.58" dur="4.009">what the central banks around the world</text>
  <text start="806.14" dur="5.46">what they have done they have destroyed</text>
  <text start="808.589" dur="5.801">countries and people say well how&amp;#39;d they</text>
  <text start="811.6" dur="4.92">destroy them when you create currency</text>
  <text start="814.39" dur="4.77">out of thin air by pushing a button or</text>
  <text start="816.52" dur="8.93">before they had a printing press and you</text>
  <text start="819.16" dur="9.6">attach interest to the currency there is</text>
  <text start="825.45" dur="7.66">not enough of this currency out there to</text>
  <text start="828.76" dur="8.46">ever repay it it&amp;#39;s impossible if they</text>
  <text start="833.11" dur="6.72">print up $100 and they say you owe 125</text>
  <text start="837.22" dur="6.72">or a hundred and ten or a hundred and</text>
  <text start="839.83" dur="7.62">five where do you get the extra $5 if it</text>
  <text start="843.94" dur="6.66">doesn&amp;#39;t exist well you have to borrow</text>
  <text start="847.45" dur="4.43">more and if you borrow more now you mo</text>
  <text start="850.6" dur="3.38">you owe more in</text>
  <text start="851.88" dur="3.93">interest and what they do is they</text>
  <text start="853.98" dur="4.89">continue this on over time and over time</text>
  <text start="855.81" dur="5.43">this system breaks down now let&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="858.87" dur="4.35">even talk about what else they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="861.24" dur="4.17">because we don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="863.22" dur="4.47">I mean yes we have some idea what the</text>
  <text start="865.41" dur="6.06">central banks have been doing but they</text>
  <text start="867.69" dur="6.96">have the ability to create currency to</text>
  <text start="871.47" dur="6.21">pay off certain government individuals</text>
  <text start="874.65" dur="6.66">to keep them quiet to keep them on their</text>
  <text start="877.68" dur="6.77">side because think about it why in the</text>
  <text start="881.31" dur="6.84">world would these government employees</text>
  <text start="884.45" dur="5.98">support a private corporation if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="888.15" dur="5.67">nothing in it for them why would they</text>
  <text start="890.43" dur="6.68">reject an audit bill it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="893.82" dur="7.32">unless they&amp;#39;re receiving funds unless</text>
  <text start="897.11" dur="8.35">they&amp;#39;re receiving tips unless they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="901.14" dur="6.72">the pockets of the central bank and this</text>
  <text start="905.46" dur="6.03">is what we are seeing right now we are</text>
  <text start="907.86" dur="6.84">seeing the corruption due to the central</text>
  <text start="911.49" dur="7.2">banking system that&amp;#39;s what this system</text>
  <text start="914.7" dur="6.87">does and they corrupt the leaders so the</text>
  <text start="918.69" dur="5.67">leaders are on the side of the central</text>
  <text start="921.57" dur="6.69">banking system and this way they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="924.36" dur="8.73">ashore that guess what they&amp;#39;ll never get</text>
  <text start="928.26" dur="7.59">rid of us but now we see things could be</text>
  <text start="933.09" dur="7.41">changing we see there&amp;#39;s a different</text>
  <text start="935.85" dur="7.77">agenda we see em hopefully this audit</text>
  <text start="940.5" dur="6.03">bill this time around will pass this</text>
  <text start="943.62" dur="5.82">audit bill will make it to the president</text>
  <text start="946.53" dur="6.51">this audit bill will be signed by the</text>
  <text start="949.44" dur="6.51">president to look into the books of the</text>
  <text start="953.04" dur="3.93">Federal Reserve to try to find out what</text>
  <text start="955.95" dur="4.26">they are up to</text>
  <text start="956.97" dur="8.1">and slowly bring out all this</text>
  <text start="960.21" dur="7.98">information to enable us to shut it down</text>
  <text start="965.07" dur="5.82">and I do believe this has been the real</text>
  <text start="968.19" dur="5.19">agenda all along and I think this is</text>
  <text start="970.89" dur="4.68">where everything is headed don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="973.38" dur="4.59">full reach it but this is where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="975.57" dur="3.78">headed this is why he has Andrew Jackson</text>
  <text start="977.97" dur="3.27">hanging on the wall in the White House</text>
  <text start="979.35" dur="3.87">because he was the president who</text>
  <text start="981.24" dur="4.71">campaigned on getting rid of the central</text>
  <text start="983.22" dur="5.01">bank now today the central bank</text>
  <text start="985.95" dur="6.06">is much much larger has been in power</text>
  <text start="988.23" dur="5.85">much longer and it&amp;#39;s intertwined with</text>
  <text start="992.01" dur="3.96">the deep state the Cabal and everything</text>
  <text start="994.08" dur="4.62">else so we&amp;#39;re gonna have to see how this</text>
  <text start="995.97" dur="6.78">plays out how far this audit bill gets</text>
  <text start="998.7" dur="7.53">but I do believe the time is right I do</text>
  <text start="1002.75" dur="6">believe that this time it might make it</text>
  <text start="1006.23" dur="5.97">through and we might have an actual</text>
