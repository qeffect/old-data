  <text start="855.08" dur="5.82">I might have to I&amp;#39;ll have to see how</text>
  <text start="857.66" dur="6.65">this all plays out now Trump he got rid</text>
  <text start="860.9" dur="7.98">of Bolton as we know he was a neocon and</text>
  <text start="864.31" dur="7.48">he decided to announce robert c obrien</text>
  <text start="868.88" dur="6.72">to replace john bolton and this</text>
  <text start="871.79" dur="5.81">individual is a presidential envoy for</text>
  <text start="875.6" dur="5.37">hostage affairs at the State Department</text>

  <text start="884.41" dur="8.68">what this individual does how he plays</text>
  <text start="889.07" dur="6.03">the game is he a white hat or is he a</text>
  <text start="893.09" dur="4.32">black hat Trump tweeted out the</text>

  <text start="910.55" dur="6.27">do a great job now Trump did consider</text>
  <text start="913.54" dur="4.54">O&amp;#39;Brien for Navy secretary 2017 but</text>
  <text start="916.82" dur="4.68">instead appointed him to the State</text>
  <text start="918.08" dur="6.57">Department position so I do believe that</text>
  <text start="921.5" dur="5.37">Trump is saying that he&amp;#39;s worked long</text>
  <text start="924.65" dur="5.7">and hard with him and he was also</text>
  <text start="926.87" dur="7.41">responsible for getting ASAP out of</text>

  <text start="939.59" dur="8.4">plays out now very interestingly Saudi</text>
  <text start="943.67" dur="9.21">Arabia they revealed the evidence that</text>
  <text start="947.99" dur="6.75">yes Iran was involved in the attacks</text>
  <text start="952.88" dur="3.48">and they laid out all the pieces the</text>
  <text start="954.74" dur="5.099">cruise missiles and what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="956.36" dur="7.469">is that there were 18 DeltaWing UAVs and</text>
  <text start="959.839" dur="6">seven cruise missiles fired at the</text>
  <text start="963.829" dur="4.771">production facility when they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="965.839" dur="5.571">it was not Yemen but they stopped short</text>
  <text start="968.6" dur="5.549">in saying that it was definitely Iran</text>
  <text start="971.41" dur="5.799">they were saying that it came from the</text>
  <text start="974.149" dur="7.321">north or so but didn&amp;#39;t say it was</text>
  <text start="977.209" dur="8.041">definitely a ram now the problem with</text>
  <text start="981.47" dur="6.96">all this is that we know their air</text>
  <text start="985.25" dur="6.98">defense missile system set up to protect</text>
  <text start="988.43" dur="9.409">the oil facilities around Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="992.23" dur="9.82">why didn&amp;#39;t the air defense systems</text>
  <text start="997.839" dur="7">launch during the attack think about</text>
  <text start="1002.05" dur="7.26">that for a second cruise missiles were</text>
  <text start="1004.839" dur="7.891">headed in I mean do they not work did</text>
  <text start="1009.31" dur="6.36">someone shut them down did someone want</text>
  <text start="1012.73" dur="6.39">this to happen it&amp;#39;s starting to seem</text>
  <text start="1015.67" dur="8.369">that way and it seems that everyone</text>
  <text start="1019.12" dur="7.589">wanted to push some type of Iran war or</text>
  <text start="1024.039" dur="7.441">having a war or have a War break out in</text>
  <text start="1026.709" dur="7.771">the Middle East but guess what Trump he</text>
  <text start="1031.48" dur="7.199">doesn&amp;#39;t play that game he&amp;#39;s not looking</text>
  <text start="1034.48" dur="5.67">for a war he tweeted out I have just</text>
  <text start="1038.679" dur="3.421">instructed the Secretary of the Treasury</text>
  <text start="1040.15" dur="6.059">to substantially increase sanctions on</text>
  <text start="1042.1" dur="6.48">the country of Iran Trump is putting</text>
  <text start="1046.209" dur="4.59">pressure on Iran but he&amp;#39;s not willing to</text>
  <text start="1048.58" dur="6.42">go to war he was not willing to go to</text>
  <text start="1050.799" dur="7.531">war North Korea Syria he is a negotiator</text>
  <text start="1055" dur="5.19">he puts pressure on the country until</text>
  <text start="1058.33" dur="4.589">they&amp;#39;re ready and willing to negotiate</text>
  <text start="1060.19" dur="5.55">now I do believe there was a backroom</text>
  <text start="1062.919" dur="4.921">deal that was already made they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1065.74" dur="4.62">playing out the show we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="1067.84" dur="5.42">before in North Korea and I believe</text>
  <text start="1070.36" dur="6.179">sooner than later we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="1073.26" dur="8.22">either side don&amp;#39;t know which most likely</text>
  <text start="1076.539" dur="8.101">Iran start to say listen we need to talk</text>
  <text start="1081.48" dur="5.08">now are they going to say that no it</text>
  <text start="1084.64" dur="6.36">will come out in another way</text>
  <text start="1086.56" dur="7.2">just like with North Korea if you</text>
  <text start="1091" dur="5.88">noticed Iran has given Europe many many</text>
  <text start="1093.76" dur="5.61">chances we know that John Kerry has been</text>
  <text start="1096.88" dur="4.62">out there and other former government</text>
  <text start="1099.37" dur="4.23">officials they were out in Iran trying</text>
  <text start="1101.5" dur="4.2">to keep this deal together and believe</text>
  <text start="1103.6" dur="7.11">me you only go out there is if you have</text>
  <text start="1105.7" dur="8.46">a stake in that deal because if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1110.71" dur="5.19">just a nuclear deal and Trump just wants</text>
  <text start="1114.16" dur="4.5">to create a new one it&amp;#39;s not really that</text>
  <text start="1115.9" dur="5.61">big of a deal but if the deal encompass</text>
  <text start="1118.66" dur="5.76">something else that affects you that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1121.51" dur="6.12">why you personally go to Iran and say</text>
  <text start="1124.42" dur="5.91">hey don&amp;#39;t drop this deal remember they</text>
  <text start="1127.63" dur="4.77">violated the Logan act yeah they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1130.33" dur="5.12">gonna get arrested or anything but they</text>
  <text start="1132.4" dur="6.9">purposely went out there because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1135.45" dur="7.6">involved you wouldn&amp;#39;t do it if it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1139.3" dur="7.5">a normal US deal did they all go to</text>
  <text start="1143.05" dur="7.56">Mexico and Canada to try to stop the</text>
  <text start="1146.8" dur="8.42">renegotiation of NAFTA now strange how</text>
  <text start="1150.61" dur="7.74">they just went to Iran to stop this</text>
  <text start="1155.22" dur="5.8">because they&amp;#39;re hiding something</text>
  <text start="1158.35" dur="6.98">we all know it we all know what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1161.02" dur="7.95">done now very interestingly there was a</text>
  <text start="1165.33" dur="7.33">driver who crashed into the lobby of</text>
  <text start="1168.97" dur="6.51">Trump Plaza in New Rochelle and the</text>

  <text start="1175.48" dur="5.82">crashed into the lobby sat on the sofa</text>
  <text start="1177.93" dur="5.38">without saying a word now we know the</text>
  <text start="1181.3" dur="3.87">deep state can control innocence it</text>
  <text start="1183.31" dur="4.4">seems like this individual was dazed</text>
  <text start="1185.17" dur="8.01">confused didn&amp;#39;t say a word</text>
  <text start="1187.71" dur="7.96">was this a message to trump because</text>
  <text start="1193.18" dur="5.16">think about it it just so happened</text>
  <text start="1195.67" dur="6.36">someone drove into Trump Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1198.34" dur="7.35">building does that I mean the odds again</text>
  <text start="1202.03" dur="6.69">are astronomical think about how many</text>
  <text start="1205.69" dur="4.8">buildings are are and I know yes on</text>
  <text start="1208.72" dur="3.93">MSNBC there was an individual saying</text>
  <text start="1210.49" dur="4.92">then I had thoughts of driving into</text>
  <text start="1212.65" dur="4.61">Trump&amp;#39;s building and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="1215.41" dur="5.149">someone did</text>
  <text start="1217.26" dur="6.27">now I believe again just like with</text>
  <text start="1220.559" dur="6.391">everything else this was a message they</text>
  <text start="1223.53" dur="5.639">know what&amp;#39;s coming remember they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1226.95" dur="4.53">gonna be dripping this stuff out there</text>

  <text start="1235.83" dur="8.88">going to turn the screws because they</text>
  <text start="1240.179" dur="7.261">want them to freak out they want to have</text>
  <text start="1244.71" dur="4.95">them panic so they do really stupid</text>
  <text start="1247.44" dur="5.989">things to expose themselves</text>
  <text start="1249.66" dur="7.53">that&amp;#39;s how Trump and the Patriots work</text>
  <text start="1253.429" dur="7.451">it&amp;#39;s all planned out it&amp;#39;s not just a one</text>
  <text start="1257.19" dur="6.27">and done thing they want them to expose</text>
  <text start="1260.88" dur="5.61">themselves think about the border with</text>
  <text start="1263.46" dur="5.849">Trump continually hit Nancy and Schumer</text>
  <text start="1266.49" dur="5.309">and the rest about the border and he</text>
  <text start="1269.309" dur="4.561">gained ground and people started to see</text>
  <text start="1271.799" dur="4.291">yeah what they don&amp;#39;t want to stop gang</text>
  <text start="1273.87" dur="4.95">members they don&amp;#39;t want to stop drug</text>

  <text start="1280.74" dur="4.5">people go to the port of entry that</text>
  <text start="1282.84" dur="5.13">doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense because if they</text>
  <text start="1285.24" dur="6">truly want to siloam and they&amp;#39;re afraid</text>
  <text start="1287.97" dur="5.9">of returning home they would go to the</text>

  <text start="1313.89" dur="6.48">Dems they were exposed at that point</text>
  <text start="1317.45" dur="5.7">Trump on the Patriots part of this</text>
  <text start="1320.37" dur="8.22">planning is to have them expose</text>
  <text start="1323.15" dur="7.54">themselves throughout this process look</text>
  <text start="1328.59" dur="5.79">at Comey who&amp;#39;s who&amp;#39;s out there saying</text>
