  <text start="32.73" dur="4.5">today&amp;#39;s date is April 4th 2014 and the</text>
  <text start="35.22" dur="4.38">title of this episode is the economic</text>
  <text start="37.23" dur="5.34">war has begun which will lead to World</text>
  <text start="39.6" dur="4.26">War 3 because we need to take a look all</text>
  <text start="42.57" dur="3.36">around the world and we have to</text>
  <text start="43.86" dur="3.96">understand what is going on we</text>
  <text start="45.93" dur="4.83">understand that the United States right</text>
  <text start="47.82" dur="6.9">now is spread out all across the world</text>
  <text start="50.76" dur="7.32">why to prop up the petro dollar to keep</text>
  <text start="54.72" dur="5.339">the dollar alive long enough to start a</text>
  <text start="58.08" dur="4.079">war because they realize that the</text>
  <text start="60.059" dur="4.17">economy is coming down so they&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="62.159" dur="4.681">middle east and they&amp;#39;re trying as best</text>
  <text start="64.229" dur="4.14">they possibly can the central bankers</text>
  <text start="66.84" dur="4.349">u.s. government with the up with the</text>
  <text start="68.369" dur="6.121">armed forces to keep the people in those</text>
  <text start="71.189" dur="5.25">countries back and to maintain the</text>
  <text start="74.49" dur="4.589">status quo in those countries and keep</text>
  <text start="76.439" dur="4.621">the puppet government in power and to</text>
  <text start="79.079" dur="4.83">keep the central bank and all their</text>
  <text start="81.06" dur="4.89">natural resources on the US dollar we</text>
  <text start="83.909" dur="5.31">see this in Africa we see this in Middle</text>
  <text start="85.95" dur="6.059">East they thought let&amp;#39;s go to Ukraine we</text>
  <text start="89.219" dur="5.22">can create this coup d&amp;#39;etat we&amp;#39;ll spend</text>
  <text start="92.009" dur="4.411">five billion dollars and we&amp;#39;ll just take</text>
  <text start="94.439" dur="4.35">over Ukraine will overthrow the</text>
  <text start="96.42" dur="4.619">government and we can prop up the system</text>
  <text start="98.789" dur="4.89">a little bit longer plus it will give us</text>
  <text start="101.039" dur="5.551">a strategic location right near Russia</text>
  <text start="103.679" dur="6.061">and along the Black Sea this kind of</text>
  <text start="106.59" dur="5.129">backfired and they&amp;#39;re not getting the</text>
  <text start="109.74" dur="3.839">Black Sea portion they&amp;#39;re not getting</text>
  <text start="111.719" dur="5.01">the entire country they&amp;#39;re getting the</text>
  <text start="113.579" dur="5.881">West and again this is what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="116.729" dur="3.84">trying to do to continually prop up the</text>
  <text start="119.46" dur="4.859">system they thought they were going to</text>
  <text start="120.569" dur="6.961">go into Syria and Iran and push Russia</text>
  <text start="124.319" dur="5.19">out of there and place a central bank a</text>
  <text start="127.53" dur="3.69">private western central bank in these</text>
  <text start="129.509" dur="4.591">countries remove the government replace</text>
  <text start="131.22" dur="5.43">them with a puppet government and put</text>
  <text start="134.1" dur="4.59">all their resources on the US dollar to</text>
  <text start="136.65" dur="3.87">continually prop up the dollar and how</text>
  <text start="138.69" dur="4.11">does this prop up the dollar well</text>
  <text start="140.52" dur="4.83">that means more and more countries need</text>
  <text start="142.8" dur="5.25">to keep the dollar in reserves to buy</text>
  <text start="145.35" dur="4.26">these natural resources if right now</text>
  <text start="148.05" dur="4.83">let&amp;#39;s say they are going to purchase</text>
  <text start="149.61" dur="4.68">from Syria or Iran they don&amp;#39;t need US</text>
  <text start="152.88" dur="4.26">dollars so they don&amp;#39;t have to hold as</text>
  <text start="154.29" dur="4.8">much this is the entire point of what</text>
  <text start="157.14" dur="3.93">they are trying to do and when I say</text>
  <text start="159.09" dur="6.15">they the central bankers US government</text>
  <text start="161.07" dur="7.08">now what have they done since to push</text>
  <text start="165.24" dur="4.86">their economic war Ford because they see</text>
  <text start="168.15" dur="3.87">what&amp;#39;s happening they&amp;#39;re losing the</text>
  <text start="170.1" dur="4.26">battle in Syria they have these peace</text>
  <text start="172.02" dur="4.62">talks with the Iran that aren&amp;#39;t going to</text>
  <text start="174.36" dur="3.45">go anywhere and they lost what they</text>
  <text start="176.64" dur="4.02">thought they were going to get in</text>
  <text start="177.81" dur="4.98">Ukraine so they push these sanctions</text>
  <text start="180.66" dur="4.47">which are absolutely ridiculous they</text>
  <text start="182.79" dur="5.58">push these sanctions on individuals and</text>
  <text start="185.13" dur="5.25">some banks which allowed Russia to say</text>
  <text start="188.37" dur="5.58">you know what if you&amp;#39;re going to make</text>
  <text start="190.38" dur="5.4">this move we&amp;#39;re going to accelerate what</text>
  <text start="193.95" dur="4.17">we&amp;#39;re going to do now we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="195.78" dur="5.13">create our own payment system we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="198.12" dur="4.62">going to put our oil on the ruble and</text>
  <text start="200.91" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;re going to call it the petro ruble</text>
  <text start="202.74" dur="5.1">we&amp;#39;re going to back our currency with</text>
  <text start="204.87" dur="4.86">gold then we&amp;#39;re going to go out there</text>
  <text start="207.84" dur="4.95">and make deals with other countries to</text>
  <text start="209.73" dur="4.62">completely bypass the dollar and this is</text>
  <text start="212.79" dur="3.87">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and this is</text>
  <text start="214.35" dur="4.17">not a coincidence this is something that</text>
  <text start="216.66" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;ve been planning for this is</text>
  <text start="218.52" dur="5.06">something that they needed to do because</text>
  <text start="220.74" dur="7.71">they understand they needed to provoke</text>
  <text start="223.58" dur="7.3">Russia and China North Korea India Iran</text>
  <text start="228.45" dur="6.69">and Syria to make a move to make deals</text>
  <text start="230.88" dur="6.42">with these countries this allows the</text>
  <text start="235.14" dur="4.59">United States and the central bankers to</text>
  <text start="237.3" dur="5.64">start the economic war between the</text>
  <text start="239.73" dur="5.34">United States the euro and Russia and is</text>
  <text start="242.94" dur="5.6">that battle of building up military</text>
  <text start="245.07" dur="6.69">assets on either side at this point as</text>
  <text start="248.54" dur="5.98">of right now NATO and the United States</text>
  <text start="251.76" dur="6.03">are now surrounding Russia they already</text>
  <text start="254.52" dur="6.21">did the pivot to Asia where they put all</text>
  <text start="257.79" dur="5.52">the missile the military assets out in</text>
  <text start="260.73" dur="5.189">the Pacific they have 60% of the fleet</text>
  <text start="263.31" dur="6.63">out in the Pacific they&amp;#39;re in Japan</text>
  <text start="265.919" dur="5.31">moving to a new location to enhance the</text>
  <text start="269.94" dur="3.06">base so they can bring in more</text>
  <text start="271.229" dur="2.91">sophisticated weapons there in the</text>
  <text start="273" dur="3.21">Philippines</text>
  <text start="274.139" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re setting up everything right now</text>
  <text start="276.21" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re even bringing in new equipment</text>
  <text start="278.699" dur="3.9">for the missile shield going from Poland</text>
  <text start="280.53" dur="3.479">all the way down to Romania and this</text>
  <text start="282.599" dur="3.72">missile shield was really there always</text>
  <text start="284.009" dur="5.011">for Russia it was never there for Iran</text>
  <text start="286.319" dur="4.59">and they realize what is happening and</text>
  <text start="289.02" dur="4.019">they&amp;#39;re pushing this agenda forward</text>
  <text start="290.909" dur="5.401">because the recovery here in the United</text>
  <text start="293.039" dur="7.141">States is an illusion and it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="296.31" dur="6.24">held together by spit tape and whatever</text>
  <text start="300.18" dur="5.699">else they have just to keep it together</text>
  <text start="302.55" dur="5.459">and they&amp;#39;re throwing out a huge amount</text>
  <text start="305.879" dur="4.41">of different statistics changing</text>
  <text start="308.009" dur="4.261">calculations manipulating all the</text>
  <text start="310.289" dur="4.5">information and we can see this</text>
  <text start="312.27" dur="5.73">happening right now and right now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="314.789" dur="6.331">you we are in economic war between the</text>
  <text start="318" dur="6.15">dollar the ruble and the yuan and this</text>
  <text start="321.12" dur="5.729">will eventually lead to World War three</text>
  <text start="324.15" dur="5.639">and of course we understand that Europe</text>
  <text start="326.849" dur="5.22">is completely in a recession slash</text>
  <text start="329.789" dur="4.35">depression they can spin the propaganda</text>
  <text start="332.069" dur="4.56">all they want they can tell us they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="334.139" dur="4.291">coming out of recovery they can say that</text>
  <text start="336.629" dur="3.391">everything&amp;#39;s getting better and next</text>
  <text start="338.43" dur="4.44">year it&amp;#39;s even going to be better than</text>
  <text start="340.02" dur="4.769">this year they said that a year ago two</text>
  <text start="342.87" dur="4.409">years ago and look where they are today</text>
  <text start="344.789" dur="4.65">all we&amp;#39;re seeing is unemployment going</text>
  <text start="347.279" dur="4.62">up we see the youth employment getting</text>
  <text start="349.439" dur="5.521">higher more and more people are getting</text>
  <text start="351.899" dur="5.49">sick and tired of the government&amp;#39;s lying</text>
  <text start="354.96" dur="5.04">to them they are rising up and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="357.389" dur="3.93">saying enough is enough and if we go out</text>
  <text start="360" dur="3.629">to Cyprus right now they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="361.319" dur="4.741">they&amp;#39;re heading down the same exact path</text>
  <text start="363.629" dur="4.731">as Greece and their unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="366.06" dur="4.529">even though they told us they were</text>
  <text start="368.36" dur="3.669">removing the capital controls and I</text>
  <text start="370.589" dur="3.06">haven&amp;#39;t seen any additional reports that</text>
  <text start="372.029" dur="4.11">they actually did it they said it</text>
  <text start="373.649" dur="3.63">doesn&amp;#39;t mean they did it and they said</text>
  <text start="376.139" dur="2.971">they were going to remove them but I</text>
  <text start="377.279" dur="4.051">haven&amp;#39;t heard of any other reports at</text>
  <text start="379.11" dur="4.26">this time but what we&amp;#39;re seeing in</text>

  <text start="390.75" dur="7.62">right now in March of their their</text>
  <text start="395.099" dur="6.06">unemployment has reached around 17% at</text>
  <text start="398.37" dur="5.31">this time and again it&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="401.159" dur="4.711">going up and up and up and all that</text>
  <text start="403.68" dur="4.09">happened there was they had a balun</text>
  <text start="405.87" dur="3.639">where they stole the people&amp;#39;s money then</text>
  <text start="407.77" dur="5.16">had bailouts which they took on more</text>
  <text start="409.509" dur="6.9">debt so again people are out of work</text>
  <text start="412.93" dur="5.459">their life savings are gone and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="416.409" dur="5.671">hoping that the economy will flourish</text>
  <text start="418.389" dur="5.611">after this how you got may look at</text>
  <text start="422.08" dur="3.839">Greece they&amp;#39;re trying to get their third</text>

  <text start="510.99" dur="4.96">opposite and we always see the opposite</text>

  <text start="649.48" dur="4.5">are these jobs that they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="651.58" dur="5.46">about that everybody&amp;#39;s getting well if</text>
  <text start="653.98" dur="6.96">we really break it down only two</text>
  <text start="657.04" dur="6.63">thousand full-time high wage jobs were</text>
  <text start="660.94" dur="5.67">added in March that means those people</text>
  <text start="663.67" dur="6.71">who are trying to get a job making the</text>
  <text start="666.61" dur="7.53">same salary of 70 80 $90,000 a year only</text>
  <text start="670.38" dur="6.97">2,000 of those were added in March the</text>
  <text start="674.14" dur="6.36">rest of the jobs were temp help which</text>
  <text start="677.35" dur="7.08">were twenty nine thousand jobs for temp</text>

  <text start="692.89" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re working and we can see that this</text>
  <text start="695.53" dur="4.53">is not a recovery we have to remember</text>
  <text start="698.44" dur="6.87">since the beginning of this year of 2014</text>
  <text start="700.06" dur="8.34">we have had mass layoffs and these</text>

  <text start="732.88" dur="4.89">same type of job they&amp;#39;re not and what</text>
  <text start="735.76" dur="4.44">happens is these people go from these</text>
  <text start="737.77" dur="5.19">high paying jobs to one to two to three</text>

  <text start="1001.98" dur="2.76">pushing climate change of course they</text>
  <text start="1003.54" dur="2.4">change it from climate warming to</text>
  <text start="1004.74" dur="5.13">climate change because it made no sense</text>
  <text start="1005.94" dur="5.31">because the entire world was cold so how</text>
  <text start="1009.87" dur="3.06">could you say you know there&amp;#39;s climate</text>
  <text start="1011.25" dur="4.17">warming so they had to claim that it</text>
  <text start="1012.93" dur="4.86">changes the climate change and of course</text>
  <text start="1015.42" dur="4.5">the president has set up you know a fund</text>
  <text start="1017.79" dur="4.62">for climate change they&amp;#39;re creating this</text>
  <text start="1019.92" dur="5.07">website and I said all of this is</text>
  <text start="1022.41" dur="4.32">because they need to raise more revenue</text>
  <text start="1024.99" dur="3.63">and this is what governments do they</text>
  <text start="1026.73" dur="3.719">look around they see what they can do</text>
  <text start="1028.62" dur="4.5">and they see what they can blame on the</text>

  <text start="1033.12" dur="4.38">they can get that guilt up in that fear</text>

  <text start="1039.209" dur="4.021">them that it&amp;#39;s the right thing to do and</text>
  <text start="1041.4" dur="3.99">this is what they&amp;#39;re actually doing with</text>
  <text start="1043.23" dur="4.589">climate change because what they&amp;#39;re that</text>
  <text start="1045.39" dur="4.26">what they need is they need more revenue</text>
  <text start="1047.819" dur="3.721">into the government because there&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1049.65" dur="4.17">not enough people working they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1051.54" dur="3.99">have the revenue to sustain what is</text>
  <text start="1053.82" dur="4.38">going on they are spending way too much</text>

  <text start="1064.11" dur="3.63">continually tax people and we see this</text>
  <text start="1065.61" dur="4.17">happening in Spain we see it in Italy we</text>
  <text start="1067.74" dur="3.54">see it in France and of course United</text>
  <text start="1069.78" dur="3.08">States is going across the ocean with</text>
  <text start="1071.28" dur="4.64">fact they&amp;#39;re looking for</text>
  <text start="1072.86" dur="5.28">uh everyone that they possibly can find</text>
  <text start="1075.92" dur="4.47">that is making an income that has a u.s.</text>
  <text start="1078.14" dur="3.63">passport and they like to tax them and</text>
  <text start="1080.39" dur="3.06">this is why people are turning in their</text>
  <text start="1081.77" dur="3.659">passports because they&amp;#39;re saying this is</text>
  <text start="1083.45" dur="4.2">ridiculous they&amp;#39;re making deals with</text>

  <text start="1087.65" dur="3.12">money in different banks and all around</text>
  <text start="1089.48" dur="3.51">the country because that money needs to</text>
  <text start="1090.77" dur="4.62">be taxed and now they&amp;#39;re turning toward</text>
  <text start="1092.99" dur="5.64">climate change because Obamacare was a</text>

  <text start="1800.05" dur="5.46">to cut off supplies from Russia gas</text>
  <text start="1803.47" dur="3.99">prices in Europe are going to rise about</text>
  <text start="1805.51" dur="3.48">50 percent and this might not be a good</text>
  <text start="1807.46" dur="3.06">idea I mention this in my other report</text>

  <text start="1835.63" dur="5.52">look at the countries that are dependent</text>
  <text start="1837.97" dur="6.06">on Russia right now I mean Poland</text>

  <text start="2185.74" dur="3.6">off the central banks and the</text>
  <text start="2187.9" dur="3.45">government&amp;#39;s because they do not want to</text>

  <text start="2197.98" dur="5.16">continually doing this over and over and</text>
  <text start="2200.41" dur="4.68">over and as we know they need to keep</text>
  <text start="2203.14" dur="5.19">the dollar propped up so they can get</text>
  <text start="2205.09" dur="5.88">this plan moving forward so right now</text>
  <text start="2208.33" dur="6.41">American commandos across the globe are</text>
  <text start="2210.97" dur="6.51">creating a new strategy to combat</text>
  <text start="2214.74" dur="9.49">al-qaeda cells in other countries</text>
  <text start="2217.48" dur="10.44">remember what I said Libya Iraq Lebanon</text>

  <text start="2233.29" dur="5.46">happening in Iraq the United States just</text>
  <text start="2235.96" dur="5.16">sent over the Apache helicopters we see</text>

  <text start="2241.12" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;ve taken back most of the country</text>
  <text start="2243.1" dur="3.66">they push the government out of the</text>
  <text start="2244.78" dur="4.23">Parliament building they want to sell</text>
  <text start="2246.76" dur="5.01">the oil not using the US dollar but of</text>
  <text start="2249.01" dur="5.1">course US forces step in and they</text>
  <text start="2251.77" dur="4.2">retrieve the oil tanker and brought it</text>
  <text start="2254.11" dur="3.42">back to Libya because they will not let</text>
  <text start="2255.97" dur="4.53">this happen in right now they&amp;#39;re setting</text>
  <text start="2257.53" dur="5.34">up these special commandos to go and</text>
  <text start="2260.5" dur="5.1">infiltrate all of these countries to</text>
  <text start="2262.87" dur="5.04">keep the people back they are trying</text>
  <text start="2265.6" dur="3.87">everything they possibly can</text>
  <text start="2267.91" dur="3.15">this goes on to say the Pentagon is</text>
  <text start="2269.47" dur="4.38">moving aggressively to establish a</text>
  <text start="2271.06" dur="5.25">network of elite American commandos</text>
  <text start="2273.85" dur="5.4">across the globe as part of its chain</text>
  <text start="2276.31" dur="5.88">strategy to combat al-qaeda cells in</text>
  <text start="2279.25" dur="5.61">places like North Africa and the Middle</text>
  <text start="2282.19" dur="6.87">East so we can see what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="2284.86" dur="6.45">they need to maintain the dollar the</text>
  <text start="2289.06" dur="4.59">petro dollar all across the world</text>
  <text start="2291.31" dur="3.84">they can&amp;#39;t invade these countries again</text>
  <text start="2293.65" dur="3.06">because they&amp;#39;ve already invaded them how</text>
  <text start="2295.15" dur="2.91">many times can you invade them they</text>
  <text start="2296.71" dur="4.14">already have the puppet government in</text>
  <text start="2298.06" dur="4.89">place but they need to push the agenda</text>
  <text start="2300.85" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re using drones and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2302.95" dur="4.71">left with sending in elite commandos</text>
  <text start="2305.44" dur="3.63">into these countries and of course most</text>
  <text start="2307.66" dur="3.6">of these countries are asking for</text>
  <text start="2309.07" dur="5.46">international help which opens the door</text>
  <text start="2311.26" dur="7.8">for troops to move into these countries</text>
  <text start="2314.53" dur="7.92">to help now we are seeing and we know</text>
  <text start="2319.06" dur="5.49">that when this event occurs there is</text>
  <text start="2322.45" dur="4.86">going to be a cyber attack on the</text>
  <text start="2324.55" dur="5.85">financial institution and in my other</text>
  <text start="2327.31" dur="5.49">reports going way back I mentioned that</text>
  <text start="2330.4" dur="5.34">the Nasdaq the stock exchange the bats</text>
  <text start="2332.8" dur="5.46">all seems to have certain glitches where</text>
  <text start="2335.74" dur="4.38">all of a sudden they all shut down for</text>
  <text start="2338.26" dur="4.7">no apparent reason no one can explain it</text>
  <text start="2340.12" dur="6.69">well it happened again the bats Nasdaq</text>
  <text start="2342.96" dur="6.73">decided to shut down we don&amp;#39;t know why</text>
  <text start="2346.81" dur="5.01">is it a glitch is it something laying</text>
  <text start="2349.69" dur="4.83">dormant are they testing the kill</text>
  <text start="2351.82" dur="5.58">switches it could be any one of these</text>
  <text start="2354.52" dur="6.09">and the reason for this is because they</text>
  <text start="2357.4" dur="5.64">are getting ready for a cyber attack now</text>
  <text start="2360.61" dur="4.92">if a.m. if they incorporated some type</text>
  <text start="2363.04" dur="4.26">of malware into the system to help bring</text>
  <text start="2365.53" dur="4.62">the systems down to make it look like</text>
  <text start="2367.3" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s someone else doing this this might</text>
  <text start="2370.15" dur="4.5">be causing havoc on the systems it might</text>
  <text start="2372.55" dur="4.17">interfere it might bring the system&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2374.65" dur="4.83">down and they might have to hit the kill</text>
  <text start="2376.72" dur="5.97">switches to stop it and and then the</text>
  <text start="2379.48" dur="5.16">whole system is brought back to life so</text>
  <text start="2382.69" dur="4.41">we can see that they are definitely</text>
  <text start="2384.64" dur="5.46">getting prepared to do something we see</text>
  <text start="2387.1" dur="6.69">this happen quite often and this is all</text>
  <text start="2390.1" dur="6.6">in preparation for the false flag event</text>
  <text start="2393.79" dur="5.4">now in the news there was this ex seal</text>
  <text start="2396.7" dur="7.11">that was talking about the power grid he</text>

  <text start="2427.42" dur="5.07">at this story and I&amp;#39;m saying well let me</text>
  <text start="2430.569" dur="4.411">get this straight you&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="2432.49" dur="6.39">the power grid growing down how easy it</text>
  <text start="2434.98" dur="7.529">would be to do and that he believes that</text>
  <text start="2438.88" dur="6.149">it will come down and all they need to</text>
  <text start="2442.509" dur="4.32">do is shoot in a certain location bring</text>
  <text start="2445.029" dur="3.75">down the Transformers the whole power</text>
  <text start="2446.829" dur="6.03">grid comes down and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="2448.779" dur="6.361">he got shot by Al Qaeda this looks like</text>
  <text start="2452.859" dur="4.71">this is propaganda and I have nothing</text>
  <text start="2455.14" dur="5.31">against the seals I they have my respect</text>
  <text start="2457.569" dur="5.881">all military personnel have my respect</text>
  <text start="2460.45" dur="6.03">but this seems to me as a propaganda</text>
  <text start="2463.45" dur="5.579">setup to make people understand that it</text>
  <text start="2466.48" dur="4.74">will be al Qaeda that will bring down</text>
  <text start="2469.029" dur="3.78">the power grid we understand that</text>
  <text start="2471.22" dur="4.319">they&amp;#39;ve been having drills that they</text>
  <text start="2472.809" dur="5.73">were there was a dry run in California</text>
  <text start="2475.539" dur="4.77">and people used a que 47s they shot down</text>
  <text start="2478.539" dur="4.131">at the Transformers and they brought</text>
  <text start="2480.309" dur="4.671">down the power grid in that region we</text>
  <text start="2482.67" dur="5.619">understand they&amp;#39;ve been practicing with</text>
  <text start="2484.98" dur="5.95">cyberattacks and this just seems another</text>
  <text start="2488.289" dur="5.611">piece of information that goes along</text>
  <text start="2490.93" dur="4.439">with yes we are bringing down the power</text>
  <text start="2493.9" dur="3.869">grid we just want to make sure you</text>
  <text start="2495.369" dur="5.4">understand that it will be from al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="2497.769" dur="4.951">and this is how this is looking to me</text>
  <text start="2500.769" dur="5.04">now the other day I think was yesterday</text>
  <text start="2502.72" dur="5.46">or the day before the Syrian there was</text>
  <text start="2505.809" dur="4.74">information intercepted that the Syrian</text>
  <text start="2508.18" dur="4.409">opposition forces these are the paid</text>
  <text start="2510.549" dur="4.74">mercenaries the rebels from the United</text>
  <text start="2512.589" dur="5.52">States we&amp;#39;re going to create this false</text>
  <text start="2515.289" dur="5.431">flag event where they were going to</text>
  <text start="2518.109" dur="4.351">launch a chemical attack and then blame</text>
  <text start="2520.72" dur="3.599">it on Assad and it looks like they</text>
  <text start="2522.46" dur="3.839">actually did it and I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="2524.319" dur="4.5">anyone&amp;#39;s buying this but it is another</text>
  <text start="2526.299" dur="5.581">false flag of attempt and I said they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2528.819" dur="5.641">going to create many many of these small</text>
  <text start="2531.88" dur="5.429">ones and they want to see if one of</text>
  <text start="2534.46" dur="4.95">these will actually work and we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="2537.309" dur="5.43">the one in Turkey we&amp;#39;ve seen this one</text>
  <text start="2539.41" dur="5.02">now where they they allege attack on the</text>
  <text start="2542.739" dur="4.301">neighborhood of Jobar and</text>
  <text start="2544.43" dur="5.37">capital of this Damascus and of course</text>
  <text start="2547.04" dur="4.29">they intercepted the information and now</text>
  <text start="2549.8" dur="3.15">it&amp;#39;s out there I saw it on Reuters and</text>
  <text start="2551.33" dur="3.78">some of the other corporate media</text>
  <text start="2552.95" dur="5.19">stations to say that yes</text>
  <text start="2555.11" dur="5.37">looks like Assad is you know using</text>
  <text start="2558.14" dur="4.53">chemical weapons again because CNN had</text>
  <text start="2560.48" dur="4.71">Intel that he was hiding chemical</text>
  <text start="2562.67" dur="4.65">weapons but we have to think here the UN</text>
  <text start="2565.19" dur="4.92">Security Council is in there removing</text>
  <text start="2567.32" dur="5.7">chemical weapons Assad has made a deal</text>
  <text start="2570.11" dur="4.44">with Russia and the United States to</text>
  <text start="2573.02" dur="3">remove the weapons they&amp;#39;ve been removing</text>
  <text start="2574.55" dur="3.54">it the rebels have been stopping them</text>
  <text start="2576.02" dur="4.47">from removing these chemical weapons and</text>
  <text start="2578.09" dur="4.05">all of a sudden he&amp;#39;s going to say hey</text>
  <text start="2580.49" dur="4.29">you know what I should use some chemical</text>
  <text start="2582.14" dur="4.83">weapons now the UN is here we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2584.78" dur="5.46">removing half of my chemical weapons at</text>
  <text start="2586.97" dur="5.49">this point now is the time to do this it</text>
  <text start="2590.24" dur="4.71">makes no sense there&amp;#39;s no motive behind</text>
  <text start="2592.46" dur="3.99">it but if we look at the paid</text>
  <text start="2594.95" dur="3.84">mercenaries and the rebels who are</text>
  <text start="2596.45" dur="4.92">losing and assad has been pushing the</text>
  <text start="2598.79" dur="4.86">back they have motive they have motive</text>
  <text start="2601.37" dur="5.1">because their motive and what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2603.65" dur="5.07">been showing us is the same thing ever</text>
  <text start="2606.47" dur="5.25">since they started this they want Assad</text>
  <text start="2608.72" dur="5.94">removed the Geneva 2 talks the agenda</text>
  <text start="2611.72" dur="4.89">remove Assad war crimes against Assad</text>
  <text start="2614.66" dur="5.37">couldn&amp;#39;t be proved the UN brought it up</text>
  <text start="2616.61" dur="5.19">the report was smuggled in to the UN by</text>
  <text start="2620.03" dur="3.84">the United States they had the</text>
  <text start="2621.8" dur="3.96">humanitarian reason they tried to say</text>
  <text start="2623.87" dur="4.29">they needed humanitarian aid because of</text>
  <text start="2625.76" dur="4.5">Assad&amp;#39;s war crimes Russia called the</text>
  <text start="2628.16" dur="6.21">United States on it that backfired we</text>
  <text start="2630.26" dur="6.24">had the turkey false flag attack or at</text>
  <text start="2634.37" dur="4.89">least they tried to sneak military</text>
  <text start="2636.5" dur="5.28">personnel from turkey into Syria to fire</text>
  <text start="2639.26" dur="5.13">missiles from Syria into Turkey to make</text>
  <text start="2641.78" dur="4.32">it look like Syria fired on Turkey that</text>
  <text start="2644.39" dur="3.75">failed and then we have this chemical</text>
  <text start="2646.1" dur="5.46">attack that they try to do again so they</text>
  <text start="2648.14" dur="4.5">have motive they have the reason to do</text>
  <text start="2651.56" dur="3.02">it and we have to understand that the</text>
  <text start="2652.64" dur="4.74">elections are coming up mid-july and</text>
  <text start="2654.58" dur="5.02">they can&amp;#39;t let Assad be reelected at</text>
  <text start="2657.38" dur="4.68">this point so they are getting very</text>
  <text start="2659.6" dur="6.39">desperate and they will make a move and</text>
  <text start="2662.06" dur="6.09">that move will be an event here on the</text>
  <text start="2665.99" dur="5.04">United States soil because again this</text>
  <text start="2668.15" dur="5.52">will enable the United States to start</text>
  <text start="2671.03" dur="5.43">war this will enable the United States</text>
  <text start="2673.67" dur="4.139">to bring Russia into this to bring China</text>
