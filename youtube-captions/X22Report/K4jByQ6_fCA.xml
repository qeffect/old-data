  <text start="81.86" dur="7.41">financial news now as we look at all the</text>
  <text start="85.52" dur="8.459">economic indicators in the economy we</text>
  <text start="89.27" dur="9.54">are realizing that most of the sectors</text>
  <text start="93.979" dur="8.611">of the economy are whispering in our ear</text>
  <text start="98.81" dur="6.3">telling us we&amp;#39;re heading towards this</text>
  <text start="102.59" dur="5.129">major collapse now we&amp;#39;ve been in this</text>
  <text start="105.11" dur="5.64">situation for quite a while remember the</text>
  <text start="107.719" dur="6.091">economy was created by the central bank</text>
  <text start="110.75" dur="5.31">it is a central bank economy bubbles</text>
  <text start="113.81" dur="4.53">have been blown up the American people</text>
  <text start="116.06" dur="4.11">are sitting on the sidelines and this is</text>
  <text start="118.34" dur="3.72">why when they&amp;#39;re continually telling</text>
  <text start="120.17" dur="4.46">everyone that we&amp;#39;re in this recovery</text>
  <text start="122.06" dur="5.099">when you really look at different</text>
  <text start="124.63" dur="8.5">aspects of the economy like housing</text>
  <text start="127.159" dur="9.031">retail manufacturing we see most of it</text>
  <text start="133.13" dur="4.949">hasn&amp;#39;t gone anywhere I mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="136.19" dur="4.38">telling us it&amp;#39;s an incredible recovery</text>
  <text start="138.079" dur="6.891">but when you look and you go back in</text>
  <text start="140.57" dur="8.25">history it&amp;#39;s basically flat line when</text>
  <text start="144.97" dur="5.92">indicators drop and they move up just a</text>
  <text start="148.82" dur="7.65">little bit they tell us it&amp;#39;s the new</text>
  <text start="150.89" dur="7.74">normal they basically recreate the story</text>
  <text start="156.47" dur="4.53">of what the economy is supposed to look</text>
  <text start="158.63" dur="4.38">like in a recovery because it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="161" dur="2.92">hard to explain that you know like the</text>
  <text start="163.01" dur="2.53">Baltic Dry Index for</text>
  <text start="163.92" dur="4.31">instance you know we were averaging</text>
  <text start="165.54" dur="5.58">around a thousand eleven hundred points</text>
  <text start="168.23" dur="8.29">1200 points 900 points and were down to</text>
  <text start="171.12" dur="7.35">300 points how do you explain this that</text>
  <text start="176.52" dur="4.799">everything is fine so what they do is</text>
  <text start="178.47" dur="5.519">they say okay here&amp;#39;s the new bottom we</text>
  <text start="181.319" dur="5.701">moved up 20 points everything&amp;#39;s fine see</text>
  <text start="183.989" dur="7.021">we&amp;#39;re increasing right now the initial</text>
  <text start="187.02" dur="6.81">jobless claims I mean they&amp;#39;re hitting</text>
  <text start="191.01" dur="4.83">all-time new lows they&amp;#39;re saying no one</text>
  <text start="193.83" dur="4.71">is applying for initial jobless claims</text>
  <text start="195.84" dur="4.59">well what happens a lot is that all</text>
  <text start="198.54" dur="5.1">these people that got laid off in the</text>
  <text start="200.43" dur="5.01">past have either gotten part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="203.64" dur="4.62">and if you don&amp;#39;t work a certain number</text>
  <text start="205.44" dur="4.23">of hours and you get laid off in that</text>
  <text start="208.26" dur="4.44">part time job and each state is</text>
  <text start="209.67" dur="5.73">different you can&amp;#39;t apply for it but</text>
  <text start="212.7" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing mass layoffs it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="215.4" dur="6.26">like five people here ten people here</text>

  <text start="221.66" dur="7.69">people at a time and they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="225.66" dur="6.299">that no one is being laid off and no one</text>
  <text start="229.35" dur="5.07">is applying and it makes no sense we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="440.93" dur="9.33">0.4% so it&amp;#39;s not as incredible as the</text>
  <text start="446.21" dur="6.27">corporate media&amp;#39;s making it seem and if</text>
  <text start="450.26" dur="5.63">you actually look at the durable goods</text>
  <text start="452.48" dur="5.85">and you strip out aircraft parts for the</text>
  <text start="455.89" dur="8.53">war that&amp;#39;s going on all throughout the</text>
  <text start="458.33" dur="8.57">world you see that durable goods they</text>
  <text start="464.42" dur="7.26">have been in the negative territory</text>
  <text start="466.9" dur="7.18">since the beginning of 2015 and in 2016</text>
  <text start="471.68" dur="5.49">it&amp;#39;s still in the negative territory it</text>
  <text start="474.08" dur="4.92">has not improved whatsoever and to give</text>
  <text start="477.17" dur="6.06">you an example of where it used to be</text>
  <text start="479" dur="8.28">durable goods used to be in the fifteen</text>
  <text start="483.23" dur="8.28">percent range they pumped it up right</text>
  <text start="487.28" dur="6.48">after the collapse of 2008-2009 all the</text>
  <text start="491.51" dur="7.22">way up to the fifteen to twenty percent</text>
  <text start="493.76" dur="8.79">range and we&amp;#39;ve seen it slide ever since</text>
  <text start="498.73" dur="5.98">and what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="502.55" dur="4.38">whatever they possibly can to make it</text>
  <text start="504.71" dur="4.59">seem like everything is absolutely fine</text>
  <text start="506.93" dur="4.38">now when we look at this it is really</text>
  <text start="509.3" dur="4.62">gone nowhere it&amp;#39;s flat line it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="511.31" dur="5.31">negative territory and if you go from a</text>
  <text start="513.92" dur="6">negative number like negative 10 to</text>
  <text start="516.62" dur="6.57">negative 5 is that really that great no</text>
  <text start="519.92" dur="8.13">it isn&amp;#39;t but they try to make you think</text>
  <text start="523.19" dur="8.82">it is we see the subprime auto loan it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="528.05" dur="7.53">completely melting down delinquencies</text>
  <text start="532.01" dur="7.65">are up to three or four months people</text>
  <text start="535.58" dur="6.03">are behind in payments and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="539.66" dur="4.5">seeing right now is the delinquency rate</text>
  <text start="541.61" dur="6.78">for subprime borrowers it has hit the</text>
  <text start="544.16" dur="6.63">highest level since 2009 in fact we are</text>
  <text start="548.39" dur="4.8">not too far away from totally smashing</text>
  <text start="550.79" dur="6.69">to the previous highs that were set</text>
  <text start="553.19" dur="7.74">during the last crisis remember these</text>
  <text start="557.48" dur="6.81">loans are being repackaged sold off to</text>
  <text start="560.93" dur="6.75">investors as solid investments</text>
  <text start="564.29" dur="6.06">we saw this in the sub prime real estate</text>
  <text start="567.68" dur="6.779">market they&amp;#39;re doing the same thing but</text>
  <text start="570.35" dur="10.049">in the auto loan market this is going to</text>
  <text start="574.459" dur="7.951">be a complete disaster it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="580.399" dur="4.831">work out because we know how the real</text>
  <text start="582.41" dur="9.33">estate subprime market worked out it was</text>
  <text start="585.23" dur="9.96">a disaster now the Kansas City fed the</text>

  <text start="760.85" dur="8.01">it really isn&amp;#39;t we realize that because</text>
  <text start="765.589" dur="4.771">of the corporate media because of the</text>
  <text start="768.86" dur="5.25">central bank they&amp;#39;re continually trying</text>
  <text start="770.36" dur="7.47">to convince us that the US economy is a</text>
  <text start="774.11" dur="7.41">strong service-based economy we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="777.83" dur="8.3">need manufacturing we don&amp;#39;t need it at</text>
  <text start="781.52" dur="7.68">all it&amp;#39;s fine and what we see is that</text>
  <text start="786.13" dur="4.39">manufacturing right now accounts for</text>
  <text start="789.2" dur="4.17">about twelve percent of the US economy</text>
  <text start="790.52" dur="5.67">and it employs about nine percent of the</text>
  <text start="793.37" dur="8.79">workforce because we&amp;#39;ve lost all our</text>
  <text start="796.19" dur="9.17">manufacturing so overall they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="802.16" dur="6.799">depending on a strong service economy</text>
  <text start="805.36" dur="7.9">because manufacturing is done so</text>
  <text start="808.959" dur="6.101">basically what they&amp;#39;re saying is don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="813.26" dur="3.84">worry about manufacturing even though</text>
  <text start="815.06" dur="4.58">it&amp;#39;s declining we need to look at the</text>
  <text start="817.1" dur="4.83">service industry portion of the economy</text>
  <text start="819.64" dur="5.05">but what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this</text>
  <text start="821.93" dur="5.159">is an Evan Cohen senior vice president</text>
  <text start="824.69" dur="3.99">at the Dallas Fed he gave a presentation</text>
  <text start="827.089" dur="4.341">that showed that manufacturing</text>
  <text start="828.68" dur="5.06">contraction preceded</text>
  <text start="831.43" dur="5.64">service contractions in the run-up of</text>
  <text start="833.74" dur="6.81">the past two recessions when the service</text>
  <text start="837.07" dur="5.64">sector growth begins to dwindle so still</text>
  <text start="840.55" dur="4.26">growth but slower growth after the</text>
  <text start="842.71" dur="4.08">manufacturing sector has already begun</text>
  <text start="844.81" dur="6.42">to shrink that&amp;#39;s the point he called</text>
  <text start="846.79" dur="6.359">prelude to recession and when the</text>
  <text start="851.23" dur="4.38">service sector begins to actually shrink</text>
  <text start="853.149" dur="4.921">that event marks that what officials</text>
  <text start="855.61" dur="5.13">call the beginning of the recession and</text>
  <text start="858.07" dur="8.579">guess what we&amp;#39;ve been talking about the</text>
  <text start="860.74" dur="8.219">manufacturing sector is declining the</text>
  <text start="866.649" dur="7.711">service sector is now declining</text>
  <text start="868.959" dur="7.681">following the manufacturing sector we</text>
  <text start="874.36" dur="7.11">are in big trouble everyone we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="876.64" dur="8.34">heading in that direction the bubbles</text>
  <text start="881.47" dur="5.67">are popping now we see the United States</text>
  <text start="884.98" dur="7.44">John Kerry&amp;#39;s out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="887.14" dur="10.83">warning that no one should buy the</text>
  <text start="892.42" dur="7.5">Russian bonds Russia is looking to sell</text>
  <text start="897.97" dur="4.98">about three billion of its foreign bonds</text>

  <text start="902.95" dur="4.62">issuance since the West imposed</text>
  <text start="905.02" dur="5.34">sanctions and basically the United</text>
  <text start="907.57" dur="6.019">States is trying to stop anyone from</text>
  <text start="910.36" dur="5.16">going and purchasing these bonds and</text>
  <text start="913.589" dur="4.181">what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re putting</text>
  <text start="915.52" dur="5.009">pressure on Russia this is exactly</text>
  <text start="917.77" dur="5.97">what&amp;#39;s happening right now they place</text>
  <text start="920.529" dur="5.331">sanctions on them they lower the oil</text>

  <text start="936.67" dur="5.85">pretty much it and as we know Russia was</text>
  <text start="939.88" dur="5.01">trying to get all the oil-producing</text>
  <text start="942.52" dur="6.78">countries together to put a freeze on</text>
  <text start="944.89" dur="6.84">the output and it looks like this didn&amp;#39;t</text>
