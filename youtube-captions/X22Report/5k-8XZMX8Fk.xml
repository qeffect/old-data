  <text start="83.7" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;ve picked up since about last year</text>
  <text start="86.82" dur="4.32">or so and things are starting to</text>
  <text start="89.16" dur="4.5">accelerate yes the statistical numbers</text>

  <text start="127.74" dur="4.86">2008 why would this come down now it</text>
  <text start="130.29" dur="4.77">makes no sense companies are very very</text>
  <text start="132.6" dur="5.55">strong the same thing is happening right</text>
  <text start="135.06" dur="3.899">now but we&amp;#39;ve been what we&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="138.15" dur="2.22">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at all these</text>
  <text start="138.959" dur="5.661">different indicators and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="140.37" dur="8.25">watching we&amp;#39;ve been observing and we are</text>
  <text start="144.62" dur="6.369">realizing that this system is about to</text>
  <text start="148.62" dur="3.51">implode on itself and they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="150.989" dur="3.691">whatever they possibly can to convince</text>
  <text start="152.13" dur="4.889">everyone that everything is great and</text>
  <text start="154.68" dur="5.279">there&amp;#39;s a reason for it there&amp;#39;s a plan</text>
  <text start="157.019" dur="5.071">in place and when we start to look at</text>
  <text start="159.959" dur="4.111">these economic indicators like housing</text>
  <text start="162.09" dur="5.7">housing is a very big one because this</text>
  <text start="164.07" dur="6.6">is the middle class here their wealth is</text>
  <text start="167.79" dur="5.039">tied up in real estate and when the</text>
  <text start="170.67" dur="6.48">middle-class feel that real estate is</text>
  <text start="172.829" dur="5.701">not doing well they contract and once</text>
  <text start="177.15" dur="2.73">they contract that means they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="178.53" dur="4.02">going to spend money anymore</text>
  <text start="179.88" dur="4.26">and this is exactly what is happening</text>
  <text start="182.55" dur="4.14">when the real estate market is doing</text>
  <text start="184.14" dur="4.44">well a lot of people refinance</text>
  <text start="186.69" dur="5.1">or take out equity lines of credit and</text>
  <text start="188.58" dur="5.88">they pull their funds out of the house</text>
  <text start="191.79" dur="5.34">because they&amp;#39;re expecting the house</text>
  <text start="194.46" dur="6.72">prices to continually move up but when</text>
  <text start="197.13" dur="9.93">this doesn&amp;#39;t happen guess what this part</text>
  <text start="201.18" dur="8.52">of the spending dries up and the younger</text>
  <text start="207.06" dur="6.27">generation the next generation coming up</text>
  <text start="209.7" dur="5.97">they don&amp;#39;t have the jobs to support the</text>
  <text start="213.33" dur="4.34">housing market they&amp;#39;re not out there</text>
  <text start="215.67" dur="4.32">purchasing houses especially with</text>
  <text start="217.67" dur="5.29">interest rates moving up right now and</text>
  <text start="219.99" dur="6">this is completely evident when we look</text>
  <text start="222.96" dur="5.1">at new home sales pending home sales and</text>
  <text start="225.99" dur="5.07">we just received the information for</text>
  <text start="228.06" dur="7.23">existing home sales and they are not</text>
  <text start="231.06" dur="7.74">doing well we know back in June we had</text>
  <text start="235.29" dur="6">really bad US housing data everyone was</text>
  <text start="238.8" dur="5.81">hoping for a rebound in July and it</text>
  <text start="241.29" dur="6.39">didn&amp;#39;t come existing home sales tumbled</text>
  <text start="244.61" dur="7.21">0.7 percent month on month it was</text>
  <text start="247.68" dur="6.3">expected to go up by 0.4% way off now</text>
  <text start="251.82" dur="5.36">this is the longest streak of declines</text>
  <text start="253.98" dur="5.67">since the taper tantrum in 2013</text>
  <text start="257.18" dur="6.46">single-family home sales fell by 0.2%</text>
  <text start="259.65" dur="5.66">month on month one it&amp;#39;s down 1.2 percent</text>
  <text start="263.64" dur="3.96">year-on-year</text>
  <text start="265.31" dur="5.71">think about what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="267.6" dur="6.9">we are in the summer months this is when</text>
  <text start="271.02" dur="5.7">people purchase homes they move in right</text>
  <text start="274.5" dur="4.08">before school they try to get settled</text>
  <text start="276.72" dur="3.449">it&amp;#39;s warm whether they want to move</text>
  <text start="278.58" dur="3.39">during warm weather they want to get</text>
  <text start="280.169" dur="7.381">into the house before the kids go off to</text>
  <text start="281.97" dur="8.37">school guess what it&amp;#39;s not happening the</text>
  <text start="287.55" dur="6.78">purchases of condominiums and co-op</text>
  <text start="290.34" dur="9.51">units drop by 4.8% month on month it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="294.33" dur="7.35">down 3.3% year-on-year and housing</text>
  <text start="299.85" dur="3.93">prices they are starting to come down</text>
  <text start="301.68" dur="4.08">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting housing</text>
  <text start="303.78" dur="4.79">prices were moving up and up and up and</text>
  <text start="305.76" dur="5.4">this is the inflating of the bubble and</text>
  <text start="308.57" dur="5.95">now they&amp;#39;re starting to come down a</text>
  <text start="311.16" dur="7.08">little bit why well interest rates they</text>
  <text start="314.52" dur="4.69">are moving up people can&amp;#39;t afford these</text>
  <text start="318.24" dur="4.12">homes</text>
  <text start="319.21" dur="7.079">and the bubble is popping not just here</text>
  <text start="322.36" dur="6.059">in the US but around the world we see</text>
  <text start="326.289" dur="6.421">the sentiment for home buying conditions</text>
  <text start="328.419" dur="6.06">are the worst since Lehman and whenever</text>
  <text start="332.71" dur="4.11">we see this when whenever we see the you</text>
  <text start="334.479" dur="4.94">much home buying conditions drop to the</text>
  <text start="336.82" dur="6.36">level that they are guess what hits a</text>
  <text start="339.419" dur="5.951">recession and this is what is happening</text>
  <text start="343.18" dur="4.68">right now the entire system is breaking</text>
  <text start="345.37" dur="4.95">apart but this is the plan the plan is</text>
  <text start="347.86" dur="5.309">not to have this economy continue on the</text>
  <text start="350.32" dur="5.43">way it is the plan is to bring it down</text>
  <text start="353.169" dur="4.291">but there&amp;#39;s two different plans there is</text>
  <text start="355.75" dur="4.86">a plan by the central bank in the deep</text>
  <text start="357.46" dur="7.67">state and there&amp;#39;s a plan by Trump and</text>
  <text start="360.61" dur="7.83">the Patriots and these two plans are</text>
  <text start="365.13" dur="5.77">working right now and eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="368.44" dur="5.099">going to happen is one of these plans</text>
  <text start="370.9" dur="4.41">are going to be the winner and we can</text>
  <text start="373.539" dur="4.201">see right now that Trump in the Patriots</text>
  <text start="375.31" dur="6.03">they are pushing their plan to the</text>
  <text start="377.74" dur="5.64">extreme and the Fed they&amp;#39;re kind of</text>
  <text start="381.34" dur="4.47">caught up in all this because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="383.38" dur="5.099">know what to do at this point because</text>
  <text start="385.81" dur="4.44">now Trump is calling out the Fed saying</text>
  <text start="388.479" dur="3.151">listen look what you&amp;#39;re doing with the</text>
  <text start="390.25" dur="3.78">interest rates look what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="391.63" dur="5.4">here now Trump is looking to bring the</text>
  <text start="394.03" dur="5.009">dollar lower and we could see right now</text>
  <text start="397.03" dur="3.48">this is going to be a huge problem for</text>
  <text start="399.039" dur="3.87">the Fed and eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="400.51" dur="3.689">happen is the Fed is going to be taken</text>
  <text start="402.909" dur="4.141">over most likely it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="404.199" dur="5.821">nationalized and we see that there are</text>
  <text start="407.05" dur="6.359">countries out there they know exactly</text>
  <text start="410.02" dur="5.67">what is going on they understand that</text>
  <text start="413.409" dur="4.411">the dollar is not going to remain the</text>
  <text start="415.69" dur="4.14">reserve currency of the world forever</text>
  <text start="417.82" dur="4.74">they know there&amp;#39;s too much debt they</text>
  <text start="419.83" dur="5.22">know that you need gold to build</text>
  <text start="422.56" dur="4.829">confidence in your country they know</text>
  <text start="425.05" dur="4.53">they need to get rid of debt they know</text>
  <text start="427.389" dur="6.06">that you need to separate themselves</text>
  <text start="429.58" dur="6.57">from the entire system because when the</text>
  <text start="433.449" dur="4.741">system comes down anyone that&amp;#39;s tied to</text>
  <text start="436.15" dur="5.549">it anyone that depends on it</text>
  <text start="438.19" dur="5.67">well they&amp;#39;re going down with it and we</text>
  <text start="441.699" dur="3.75">can see with Russia right now they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="443.86" dur="3.89">bought about a eight hundred and thirty</text>
  <text start="445.449" dur="7.781">nine thousand ounces of gold in July and</text>
  <text start="447.75" dur="10.04">their entire treasury holdings</text>
  <text start="453.23" dur="8.7">has dropped now their gold holdings they</text>
  <text start="457.79" dur="6.9">total around 76 billion they dumped</text>
  <text start="461.93" dur="6.39">around 90 billion of US Treasuries in</text>
  <text start="464.69" dur="7.37">April and May and what we&amp;#39;re seeing here</text>
  <text start="468.32" dur="8.85">is that Russia is trying to detach from</text>
  <text start="472.06" dur="7.57">the US dollar based system they created</text>
  <text start="477.17" dur="4.89">their own payment system they trade with</text>
  <text start="479.63" dur="5.13">many other countries using their</text>
  <text start="482.06" dur="3.36">national currencies they&amp;#39;re moving away</text>
  <text start="484.76" dur="2.76">from Adela</text>
  <text start="485.42" dur="3.81">China&amp;#39;s doing the same thing there are</text>
  <text start="487.52" dur="3.27">many turkeys doing the same thing then</text>
  <text start="489.23" dur="3.6">as well as doing the same thing there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="490.79" dur="4.92">a lot of countries out there that are</text>
  <text start="492.83" dur="4.29">moving away from the dollar because they</text>
  <text start="495.71" dur="4.5">understand what is happening here and</text>
  <text start="497.12" dur="4.53">China and Russia they have been doing</text>
  <text start="500.21" dur="3.69">this for quite a while right now they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="501.65" dur="5.19">been preparing their countries for this</text>
  <text start="503.9" dur="5.4">economic transition we see turkey is</text>
  <text start="506.84" dur="4.56">looking to join China&amp;#39;s belt and Road</text>
  <text start="509.3" dur="5.07">looks like they&amp;#39;re making a deal with</text>
  <text start="511.4" dur="5.4">Qatar to have transactions by passing</text>
  <text start="514.37" dur="4.35">the dollar India has done the same and</text>
  <text start="516.8" dur="4.14">we see many other countries Syria Iran</text>
  <text start="518.72" dur="3.78">and the rest they&amp;#39;re all doing the same</text>
  <text start="520.94" dur="3">thing and you think oh these are little</text>
  <text start="522.5" dur="4.89">just tiny countries in the Middle East</text>

  <text start="532.1" dur="4.26">different resources they want to do</text>
  <text start="534.29" dur="4.47">business with China they&amp;#39;re moving away</text>
  <text start="536.36" dur="4.5">from the dollar and using the you want</text>
  <text start="538.76" dur="6.26">because they have more economic deals</text>
  <text start="540.86" dur="7.86">with China than they do with the US and</text>
  <text start="545.02" dur="6.1">they want to use the you wan they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="548.72" dur="4.44">want to use the dollar China is building</text>
  <text start="551.12" dur="6.15">the infrastructure for many of the</text>
  <text start="553.16" dur="6.87">African nations and the u.s. well they</text>
  <text start="557.27" dur="4.05">have been garrison the countries to</text>
  <text start="560.03" dur="3.56">force them into doing something they</text>
  <text start="561.32" dur="4.62">really don&amp;#39;t want to do and remember</text>
  <text start="563.59" dur="4.45">many of the countries out there do not</text>
  <text start="565.94" dur="4.68">trust the United States because over</text>
  <text start="568.04" dur="3.72">many many years the United States I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="570.62" dur="2.16">talking about the deep state I&amp;#39;m not</text>

  <text start="579.26" dur="4.47">democracy freedom and everything else no</text>
  <text start="581.54" dur="4.32">it was for their system it was for the</text>
  <text start="583.73" dur="3.12">central banking system this is why we</text>
  <text start="585.86" dur="2.879">need to</text>
  <text start="586.85" dur="4.349">go into a country and take over and have</text>
  <text start="588.739" dur="6.3">regime change to keep their system in</text>
  <text start="591.199" dur="7.05">place and a lot of countries they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="595.039" dur="4.32">trust the United States even with Trump</text>
  <text start="598.249" dur="3.93">as president</text>
  <text start="599.359" dur="4.1">they still don&amp;#39;t trust the US because</text>
  <text start="602.179" dur="4.231">there&amp;#39;s been many many many many years</text>
  <text start="603.459" dur="6.451">where they did things that these</text>
  <text start="606.41" dur="5.819">countries do not like sanctions war</text>
  <text start="609.91" dur="4.329">going into countries having regime</text>
  <text start="612.229" dur="5.58">change destroying their infrastructure</text>
  <text start="614.239" dur="5.46">and many other countries are looking at</text>
  <text start="617.809" dur="3.63">this and saying you know something we</text>
  <text start="619.699" dur="4.05">know it&amp;#39;s happening we need to step away</text>
  <text start="621.439" dur="5.61">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see this all over</text>
  <text start="623.749" dur="6.42">the place why do you think Trump is out</text>
  <text start="627.049" dur="6.45">there making bilateral trade deals with</text>
  <text start="630.169" dur="6.09">all these countries first of all it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="633.499" dur="4.88">diversification this way this trade deal</text>
  <text start="636.259" dur="4.8">is not affected with this trade deal and</text>
  <text start="638.379" dur="5.531">he&amp;#39;s setting everything up right now not</text>
  <text start="641.059" dur="5.58">just him alone there&amp;#39;s many other people</text>
  <text start="643.91" dur="6.06">behind the scenes here everything is</text>
  <text start="646.639" dur="6.36">being set up to allow the United States</text>
  <text start="649.97" dur="5.579">to bring back manufacturing to become a</text>
  <text start="652.999" dur="5.34">great nation once again and the only way</text>
  <text start="655.549" dur="4.86">to do this is to break down what the</text>
  <text start="658.339" dur="4.71">deep sate the central bank has been</text>
  <text start="660.409" dur="4.561">building for a very long time now he</text>
  <text start="663.049" dur="4.5">only has a very short period of time to</text>
  <text start="664.97" dur="5.069">do this and everything can&amp;#39;t be done</text>
  <text start="667.549" dur="4.02">within a year or two when the deep state</text>
  <text start="670.039" dur="3.931">and the central banks had many many</text>
  <text start="671.569" dur="5.07">years to do what they&amp;#39;ve done to our</text>
  <text start="673.97" dur="4.979">country but we see there are other</text>
  <text start="676.639" dur="4.35">countries out there where they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="678.949" dur="4.92">you know something maybe we should</text>
  <text start="680.989" dur="5.67">separate ourselves from the US right now</text>
  <text start="683.869" dur="6.18">because we see that we shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="686.659" dur="6.42">dependent on their systems on their</text>

  <text start="693.079" dur="7.26">minister called for the creation of a</text>
  <text start="696.679" dur="6.93">new payment system independent of the</text>
  <text start="700.339" dur="5.91">u.s. that would allow Brussels to be</text>
  <text start="703.609" dur="7.56">independent in its financial operations</text>
  <text start="706.249" dur="6.87">from Washington he went on to say Europe</text>
  <text start="711.169" dur="5.4">should not allow the u.s. to act over</text>
  <text start="713.119" dur="6.18">our heads and at our expense for that</text>
  <text start="716.569" dur="4.021">reason it&amp;#39;s essential that we strengthen</text>
  <text start="719.299" dur="3.631">European</text>
  <text start="720.59" dur="4.98">by establishing payment channels that</text>
  <text start="722.93" dur="5.16">are independent of the u.s. creating a</text>
  <text start="725.57" dur="6.6">European monetary fund and building up</text>
  <text start="728.09" dur="6.6">an independent swift system and this is</text>
  <text start="732.17" dur="4.35">not the only country that is looking to</text>
  <text start="734.69" dur="3.27">do this there are others that are</text>
  <text start="736.52" dur="3.83">looking to do this and there are many</text>
  <text start="737.96" dur="5.22">others that have already done this and</text>
  <text start="740.35" dur="5.41">Russia is still out there calling for</text>
  <text start="743.18" dur="5.909">many nations to use their national</text>
  <text start="745.76" dur="5.1">currencies for trade there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="749.089" dur="4.561">to use the dollar now by pushing</text>
  <text start="750.86" dur="4.86">countries to do this they would use</text>
  <text start="753.65" dur="4.68">their currencies to do pretty much</text>
  <text start="755.72" dur="6.69">everything if they wanted to go to Libya</text>
  <text start="758.33" dur="6.27">or to Iraq or to Lebanon or to Syria to</text>
  <text start="762.41" dur="5.22">purchase oil they wouldn&amp;#39;t need to use</text>
  <text start="764.6" dur="4.8">US dollars which means they don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="767.63" dur="3.42">to keep all these dollars in their</text>
  <text start="769.4" dur="6.62">reserves they would use their own</text>
  <text start="771.05" dur="7.08">currency to buy that oil which then</text>
  <text start="776.02" dur="5.53">poses a problem for the United States</text>
  <text start="778.13" dur="6.27">for the central banking system for the</text>
  <text start="781.55" dur="5.19">petro dollar system what that means is</text>
  <text start="784.4" dur="4.52">all those dollars that have been sitting</text>
  <text start="786.74" dur="4.17">out in all these different countries</text>
  <text start="788.92" dur="5.2">well they&amp;#39;re gonna head back to the</text>
  <text start="790.91" dur="7.35">United States and everything that was</text>

  <text start="798.26" dur="5.61">Full Faith and Credit of the United</text>
  <text start="800.42" dur="6.03">States well that is going to completely</text>
  <text start="803.87" dur="5.13">fall apart because once all those</text>
  <text start="806.45" dur="6.05">dollars come back to the US we have this</text>
  <text start="809" dur="5.58">debt problem we have inflation and</text>
  <text start="812.5" dur="5.14">everything can&amp;#39;t be sustained because</text>
  <text start="814.58" dur="7.77">what is happening here is we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="817.64" dur="6.78">the working base anymore to pay for the</text>
  <text start="822.35" dur="5.75">amount of debt and the amount of</text>
  <text start="824.42" dur="8.64">principal it&amp;#39;s completely impossible</text>
  <text start="828.1" dur="7.18">it&amp;#39;s mathematically impossible and we</text>
  <text start="833.06" dur="4.649">can see once this starts to happen</text>
  <text start="835.28" dur="5.64">it is completely game over and it won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="837.709" dur="5.491">take that much time because once one</text>
  <text start="840.92" dur="4.47">country starts to do it another country</text>
  <text start="843.2" dur="6">joins on think about when the petro</text>
  <text start="845.39" dur="5.61">dollar system came about all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="849.2" dur="4.71">in the 70s we came off the gold standard</text>
  <text start="851" dur="3.73">they set up the petro dollar system in</text>
  <text start="853.91" dur="2.77">the middle</text>
  <text start="854.73" dur="4.859">and yes it was a couple of years but</text>
  <text start="856.68" dur="5.339">think how quickly countries latched on</text>
  <text start="859.589" dur="4.381">to this it won&amp;#39;t take them that long to</text>
  <text start="862.019" dur="4.8">get off of it and use their own</text>
  <text start="863.97" dur="5.58">currencies especially when those</text>
  <text start="866.819" dur="8.031">countries out in the Middle East aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="869.55" dur="8.389">forced to accept only the dollar</text>
  <text start="874.85" dur="7.239">remember what&amp;#39;s happening here that</text>
  <text start="877.939" dur="7">force full organization called the deep</text>
  <text start="882.089" dur="5.61">state they will not force these</text>
  <text start="884.939" dur="6.12">countries anymore to accept only the</text>
  <text start="887.699" dur="6.45">dollar these countries they&amp;#39;ll be able</text>
  <text start="891.059" dur="5.72">to accept anything they want that means</text>
  <text start="894.149" dur="7.41">the central bank the deep state system</text>
  <text start="896.779" dur="8.021">implodes this is the plan this has</text>
  <text start="901.559" dur="5.82">always been the plan except the deep</text>
  <text start="904.8" dur="5.87">state they&amp;#39;ve run the country for a very</text>
  <text start="907.379" dur="7.221">long time now everything is being</text>
  <text start="910.67" dur="8.95">switched the deep state they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="914.6" dur="6.599">hunted forced out and eventually a lot</text>
  <text start="919.62" dur="5.909">of these individuals we put into jail</text>
  <text start="921.199" dur="6.101">the system that funded the deep state is</text>
  <text start="925.529" dur="5.581">going to be dismantled it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="927.3" dur="6.959">taken over and we&amp;#39;re watching it happen</text>
  <text start="931.11" dur="4.649">in real time that is what is happening</text>
  <text start="934.259" dur="2.911">right now and you can&amp;#39;t do everything</text>
  <text start="935.759" dur="2.64">all at once it&amp;#39;s not gonna be like well</text>

  <text start="938.399" dur="6.36">just happens it&amp;#39;s one piece at a time</text>
  <text start="942.589" dur="4.75">but eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="944.759" dur="4.2">it&amp;#39;s all gonna come together and people</text>
  <text start="947.339" dur="3.271">are gonna look back and say wow look</text>
