  <text start="181.239" dur="6.03">to head out to Greece right now and we</text>
  <text start="184.45" dur="4.92">know that austerity it does not help the</text>
  <text start="187.269" dur="4.321">people whatsoever now the Bank of Greece</text>
  <text start="189.37" dur="5.16">is coming out and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="191.59" dur="7.59">the economic crisis the strict austerity</text>
  <text start="194.53" dur="8.459">in Greece well it is not working at all</text>
  <text start="199.18" dur="6.029">it&amp;#39;s killing the Greek people because</text>
  <text start="202.989" dur="4.83">what we are seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="205.209" dur="4.771">there&amp;#39;s a strong impact on the health of</text>
  <text start="207.819" dur="4.65">the population when you have this type</text>
  <text start="209.98" dur="3.629">of austerity and they actually broke it</text>
  <text start="212.469" dur="3.72">down of all the things that have</text>
  <text start="213.609" dur="4.5">increased since austerity and you have</text>
  <text start="216.189" dur="4.77">to remember people are very stressed</text>
  <text start="218.109" dur="5.341">they don&amp;#39;t have a health insurance they</text>
  <text start="220.959" dur="5.721">don&amp;#39;t have employment they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="223.45" dur="6.959">housing they feel that things are</text>
  <text start="226.68" dur="5.11">hopeless they they have no future in in</text>
  <text start="230.409" dur="4.44">their heads where they&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="231.79" dur="5.4">anything good and what they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="234.849" dur="5.01">that suicides they have increased</text>
  <text start="237.19" dur="4.769">because during this time period when the</text>
  <text start="239.859" dur="4.861">economy turns down we do see an increase</text>
  <text start="241.959" dur="5.37">of suicides we saw this back in 1929</text>
  <text start="244.72" dur="5.219">actually we saw in 2008 suicides</text>
  <text start="247.329" dur="5.041">increase we see infant mortality is</text>
  <text start="249.939" dur="4.32">increased by fifty percent increase of</text>
  <text start="252.37" dur="4.229">parts of population with mental illness</text>
  <text start="254.259" dur="4.861">especially depression that has increased</text>
  <text start="256.599" dur="5.13">chronic disease increased by twenty four</text>
  <text start="259.12" dur="7.38">percent in Greece so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="261.729" dur="7.051">is that austerity is really put into</text>
  <text start="266.5" dur="5.699">place to keep the bankers wealthy and</text>
  <text start="268.78" dur="6.569">happy the creditors wealthy and happy</text>
  <text start="272.199" dur="6.511">the central bank system continually</text>
  <text start="275.349" dur="6.57">operating and the people pay for all of</text>
  <text start="278.71" dur="7.59">this not just with their hard-earned</text>
  <text start="281.919" dur="9.06">money but with their health with their</text>
  <text start="286.3" dur="7.679">families and everything else now here in</text>
  <text start="290.979" dur="7.171">the United States they&amp;#39;re trying to keep</text>
  <text start="293.979" dur="8.071">the illusion alive that housing is fine</text>
  <text start="298.15" dur="6.51">retail is fine everything is working</text>
  <text start="302.05" dur="5.43">perfectly here no need to question</text>
  <text start="304.66" dur="4.47">anything now the US government hates</text>
  <text start="307.48" dur="2.85">when you question things because then</text>
  <text start="309.13" dur="3.75">they have to come up with answers and</text>
  <text start="310.33" dur="3.96">they have to prove it which becomes a</text>
  <text start="312.88" dur="4.65">little difficult because most of it is</text>
  <text start="314.29" dur="6.21">lies but we&amp;#39;re starting to look at the</text>
  <text start="317.53" dur="8.06">housing market and we see that housing</text>
  <text start="320.5" dur="8.37">starts well they declined by 2% and</text>
  <text start="325.59" dur="6.13">housing when you look at it really has</text>
  <text start="328.87" dur="5.01">gone nowhere now what they did is they</text>
  <text start="331.72" dur="4.92">went around to the city&amp;#39;s 20 of them or</text>
  <text start="333.88" dur="5.58">so and they decided you know what let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="336.64" dur="4.14">create bubbles in these cities and this</text>
  <text start="339.46" dur="3.99">is exactly what they did and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="340.78" dur="4.65">easy to create a bubble and I discussed</text>
  <text start="343.45" dur="4.59">this many many times before but what</text>
  <text start="345.43" dur="5.01">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now this is coming</text>
  <text start="348.04" dur="4.77">from a Paragon report which was released</text>
  <text start="350.44" dur="5.46">last week about home prices in San</text>
  <text start="352.81" dur="6.84">Francisco they&amp;#39;re saying they have</text>
  <text start="355.9" dur="5.94">cooled significantly in April and May</text>
  <text start="359.65" dur="4.56">the median price of a house rose two</text>
  <text start="361.84" dur="4.17">percent from the prior year to one point</text>
  <text start="364.21" dur="4.23">three eight million which pales in</text>
  <text start="366.01" dur="4.82">comparison to April and May of 2015</text>
  <text start="368.44" dur="7.56">which saw a twenty three percent</text>
  <text start="370.83" dur="7">increase from the prior year now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="376" dur="3.75">looking at this and they&amp;#39;re saying the</text>
  <text start="377.83" dur="3.63">cooling is most notable in the high-end</text>
  <text start="379.75" dur="4.05">market and that&amp;#39;s usually when it starts</text>
  <text start="381.46" dur="4.35">and then it comes down to the lower end</text>
  <text start="383.8" dur="5.16">and the lower end and this is what we</text>
  <text start="385.81" dur="5.07">saw back in two thousand eight and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="388.96" dur="5.7">starting to see the bubble pop because</text>
  <text start="390.88" dur="7.47">this is dramatic right now and venture</text>
  <text start="394.66" dur="5.67">capitalists in Silicon Valley their</text>
  <text start="398.35" dur="3.99">investments they have fallen by twenty</text>
  <text start="400.33" dur="6.63">percent in the first quarter from a year</text>
  <text start="402.34" dur="6.36">earlier so this is already showing that</text>
  <text start="406.96" dur="4.56">things are not going well now remember</text>
  <text start="408.7" dur="4.59">those 20 cities that they picked this is</text>
  <text start="411.52" dur="3.54">where they drove the prices up but all</text>
  <text start="413.29" dur="3.96">the outlying areas and I&amp;#39;m getting a lot</text>
  <text start="415.06" dur="4.77">of email from people who are living in</text>
  <text start="417.25" dur="4.68">many different towns where their houses</text>
  <text start="419.83" dur="3.96">are between two hundred thousand four</text>
  <text start="421.93" dur="4.38">hundred thousand maybe a little bit more</text>
  <text start="423.79" dur="4.86">than that they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="426.31" dur="4.32">difficult to sell the house people are</text>
  <text start="428.65" dur="3.39">not coming out to see it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="430.63" dur="3.24">lowering their prices</text>
  <text start="432.04" dur="3.42">they don&amp;#39;t understand what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="433.87" dur="4.29">because everyone is talking that</text>
  <text start="435.46" dur="5.34">everything is fine and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="438.16" dur="4.59">right now is houses they&amp;#39;re staying on</text>
  <text start="440.8" dur="3.9">the market longer and longer and longer</text>
  <text start="442.75" dur="3.39">and now we&amp;#39;re starting to see in these</text>
  <text start="444.7" dur="3.39">cities where they pumped up the bubbles</text>
  <text start="446.14" dur="5.79">everything&amp;#39;s starting to cool it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="448.09" dur="6.02">starting to pop and when this goes this</text>
  <text start="451.93" dur="4.59">is going to be a major major problem</text>
  <text start="454.11" dur="5.2">because this is going to bring down the</text>
  <text start="456.52" dur="5.19">entire economy because when people lose</text>
  <text start="459.31" dur="4.14">the faith in real estate and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="461.71" dur="3.39">see prices going up anymore they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="463.45" dur="3.81">going to scratch their head and say what</text>
  <text start="465.1" dur="5.07">is wrong here this is what happened in</text>
  <text start="467.26" dur="5.13">2008 and everything just came to a</text>
  <text start="470.17" dur="5.25">screeching halt the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="472.39" dur="7.62">we&amp;#39;ve seen as fallen another 11 points</text>
  <text start="475.42" dur="7.95">to 587 so we&amp;#39;re back in the 500 range</text>
  <text start="480.01" dur="5.97">already now something very interesting</text>
  <text start="483.37" dur="4.65">that came out of sovereign men about how</text>
  <text start="485.98" dur="5.97">the fed has brought back taxation</text>
  <text start="488.02" dur="7.11">without representation and if we go back</text>
  <text start="491.95" dur="5.24">in time we realized that the founding</text>
  <text start="495.13" dur="4.98">fathers Thomas Jefferson he included</text>
  <text start="497.19" dur="5.8">imposing taxes without our consent on</text>
  <text start="500.11" dur="4.77">the long list of grievances against</text>
  <text start="502.99" dur="5.55">Great Britain and he put this in the</text>
  <text start="504.88" dur="7.469">Declaration of Independence and this was</text>
  <text start="508.54" dur="7.05">enough to go to war but when we look at</text>
  <text start="512.349" dur="6.811">our government today we realize we have</text>
  <text start="515.59" dur="6.02">a central bank which does not have the</text>
  <text start="519.16" dur="5.37">best interest of the people in mind is</text>
  <text start="521.61" dur="7.75">not a body that is elected by the people</text>
  <text start="524.53" dur="7.02">whatsoever and they&amp;#39;re actually taxing</text>
  <text start="529.36" dur="4.95">us without our consent without</text>
  <text start="531.55" dur="6.54">representation and the Fed has the</text>
  <text start="534.31" dur="6.51">ability to kind of control what we do</text>
  <text start="538.09" dur="8.46">with our funds think about this for a</text>
  <text start="540.82" dur="7.77">second if they lower the rates or raise</text>
  <text start="546.55" dur="4.17">the rates they have the ability to</text>
  <text start="548.59" dur="5.46">induce people to adjust their spending</text>
  <text start="550.72" dur="5.4">habits if they want us little people to</text>
  <text start="554.05" dur="4.86">spend a little bit more they cut rates</text>
  <text start="556.12" dur="5.25">if they want us to spend less they raise</text>
  <text start="558.91" dur="5.88">rates so they can control us in that</text>
  <text start="561.37" dur="4.56">respect a combination of inflation and</text>
  <text start="564.79" dur="3.989">low interest rates</text>
  <text start="565.93" dur="6.69">benefits certain people and it causes</text>
  <text start="568.779" dur="8.461">the middle class their savings to lose</text>
  <text start="572.62" dur="7.98">purchasing power this is a transfer of</text>
  <text start="577.24" dur="7.92">wealth from savers to debtors in other</text>
  <text start="580.6" dur="6.299">words it&amp;#39;s a form of tax now unlike a</text>
  <text start="585.16" dur="4.46">normal attack which attacks which is</text>
  <text start="586.899" dur="5.88">passed by Congress huh this one is</text>
  <text start="589.62" dur="6.339">created by the central bank using the</text>
  <text start="592.779" dur="5.611">backdoor approach and we have to</text>
  <text start="595.959" dur="5.491">remember we didn&amp;#39;t get the vote for the</text>
  <text start="598.39" dur="5.759">12 members of the Federal Reserve we</text>
  <text start="601.45" dur="4.8">didn&amp;#39;t in fact based on the way the</text>

  <text start="606.25" dur="6.6">the committee members their appointed by</text>
  <text start="608.74" dur="6.27">the commercial banks so this is exactly</text>
  <text start="612.85" dur="6.39">what our founding fathers were talking</text>
  <text start="615.01" dur="9.9">about we&amp;#39;re being taxed without</text>

  <text start="624.91" dur="5.48">are seeing many of the stock markets to</text>
  <text start="627.82" dur="4.98">climb if we look at the Chinese economy</text>

  <text start="691.779" dur="3.091">government central bankers are</text>
  <text start="692.829" dur="6.061">desperately trying to keep this market</text>
  <text start="694.87" dur="4.38">alive because once the market falls this</text>
  <text start="698.89" dur="3.72">is what</text>
  <text start="699.25" dur="5.16">the general population looks at to gauge</text>
  <text start="702.61" dur="3.51">how the economy is doing and we know</text>
  <text start="704.41" dur="4.53">this has nothing to do with the economy</text>
  <text start="706.12" dur="5.22">whatsoever but the US government central</text>
  <text start="708.94" dur="5.22">bankers has brainwashed the everyday</text>
  <text start="711.34" dur="4.68">person to think that this is the gauge</text>
  <text start="714.16" dur="3.87">and this is why they&amp;#39;re trying so hard</text>
  <text start="716.02" dur="3.51">to keep it where it is now of course</text>
  <text start="718.03" dur="3.72">many people are making a lot of profits</text>
  <text start="719.53" dur="5.07">off of it there&amp;#39;s different agendas</text>
  <text start="721.75" dur="5.46">associated with it but you can see their</text>
  <text start="724.6" dur="10.16">main agenda is to keep everyone&amp;#39;s eyes</text>
  <text start="727.21" dur="11.28">fixated on the stock market now we see</text>
  <text start="734.76" dur="6.28">members of the European Parliament there</text>
  <text start="738.49" dur="5.19">now asking Draghi to unleash helicopter</text>
  <text start="741.04" dur="5.28">money now when we look at the central</text>
  <text start="743.68" dur="6.14">bankers they have done many many</text>
  <text start="746.32" dur="7.29">different things they&amp;#39;ve bought bonds</text>
  <text start="749.82" dur="6.67">corporate bonds they&amp;#39;ve used</text>
  <text start="753.61" dur="6.66">quantitative easing kept interest rates</text>
  <text start="756.49" dur="8">low some places negative and one of the</text>
  <text start="760.27" dur="8.12">last things they&amp;#39;re going to do is take</text>
  <text start="764.49" dur="6.91">the currency create a lot of it and</text>
  <text start="768.39" dur="5.62">inject it into the private sectors to</text>
  <text start="771.4" dur="6.24">hopefully stimulate spending by the</text>
  <text start="774.01" dur="6.57">people now this might work in the short</text>
  <text start="777.64" dur="4.59">run but in the long run it will not work</text>
  <text start="780.58" dur="4.92">because what happens when you</text>
  <text start="782.23" dur="6.72">continually put currency into the into</text>
  <text start="785.5" dur="6.06">the nations into the world it D values</text>
  <text start="788.95" dur="6.18">the currency and then you see inflation</text>
  <text start="791.56" dur="6.9">then you see hyperinflation and this is</text>
  <text start="795.13" dur="5.58">exactly what we&amp;#39;ll see and this might be</text>
  <text start="798.46" dur="3.75">their only solution that is left we</text>
  <text start="800.71" dur="3.9">don&amp;#39;t know they always come up with all</text>
  <text start="802.21" dur="4.56">different types of solutions but in this</text>
  <text start="804.61" dur="4.47">short run people go oh look it&amp;#39;s working</text>
  <text start="806.77" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;s working everything&amp;#39;s great but in</text>
  <text start="809.08" dur="4.8">the long run it&amp;#39;s going to fall apart</text>
  <text start="811.57" dur="6.57">and we&amp;#39;re going to be back in the same</text>
  <text start="813.88" dur="8.15">situation but worse now out in the UK we</text>
  <text start="818.14" dur="8.07">know joe cox 41 she was shot dead and</text>
  <text start="822.03" dur="7.78">stabbed the gun was homemade and this</text>
  <text start="826.21" dur="5.7">was done by thomas mayer he&amp;#39;s mentally</text>
  <text start="829.81" dur="3.21">ill and of course they&amp;#39;re using this to</text>
  <text start="831.91" dur="3.99">say that</text>
  <text start="833.02" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s the campaigners because supposedly</text>
  <text start="835.9" dur="4.58">allegedly which I don&amp;#39;t even think it</text>
  <text start="837.52" dur="5.49">happened he screamed Britain first and</text>
  <text start="840.48" dur="6.85">we can see this might have been done on</text>
  <text start="843.01" dur="7.26">purpose as a false flag as something to</text>
  <text start="847.33" dur="5.13">be used to stop what is going on in the</text>
  <text start="850.27" dur="5.67">UK because as soon as this happened the</text>
  <text start="852.46" dur="5.73">brexit campaign was suspended is now</text>
  <text start="855.94" dur="3.87">suspended for the second day actually</text>
  <text start="858.19" dur="3.63">the referendum vote is in limbo right</text>
  <text start="859.81" dur="3.42">now they might put it off we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="861.82" dur="4.2">so we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch that</text>
  <text start="863.23" dur="7.08">situation very very carefully the IMF</text>
  <text start="866.02" dur="6.39">right now is warning that the market</text>
  <text start="870.31" dur="4.67">rise and political risks threatens to</text>
  <text start="872.41" dur="6.21">derail the euro zone&amp;#39;s fragile recovery</text>
  <text start="874.98" dur="5.44">they&amp;#39;re already setting this up trying</text>
  <text start="878.62" dur="4.23">to explain away why the eurozone is</text>
  <text start="880.42" dur="4.98">going to fall apart actually it has</text>
  <text start="882.85" dur="3.9">never improved they&amp;#39;re manipulating the</text>
  <text start="885.4" dur="3.15">numbers just like the United States</text>
  <text start="886.75" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re manipulating unemployment those</text>
  <text start="888.55" dur="3.09">people have fallen off they don&amp;#39;t count</text>
  <text start="890.11" dur="3.15">if actually if you look at the</text>
  <text start="891.64" dur="4.65">unemployment numbers they have gone</text>
  <text start="893.26" dur="5.4">nowhere they&amp;#39;ve stayed steady and in</text>
  <text start="896.29" dur="4.62">some places increased and in those</text>
  <text start="898.66" dur="6.38">places where decreased they&amp;#39;re using the</text>
  <text start="900.91" dur="10.16">same manipulation as the United States</text>
  <text start="905.04" dur="8.14">so what does all of this mean well</text>
  <text start="911.07" dur="7.24">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been tracking up</text>
  <text start="913.18" dur="8.7">to this point we&amp;#39;ve been showing how the</text>
  <text start="918.31" dur="6.63">real economy has deteriorated how it is</text>
  <text start="921.88" dur="7.19">collapsing every single day and how the</text>
  <text start="924.94" dur="8.58">government continually manipulates and</text>
  <text start="929.07" dur="7.72">massages and lies about all the economic</text>
  <text start="933.52" dur="6.81">information just to keep people in the</text>
  <text start="936.79" dur="7.65">dark of what is really going on because</text>
  <text start="940.33" dur="6.3">all of this is being done on purpose</text>
  <text start="944.44" dur="4.89">because they know their system is</text>
  <text start="946.63" dur="4.68">failing we&amp;#39;re tracking it every day so</text>
  <text start="949.33" dur="4.14">when this whole entire system comes</text>
