  <text start="121.479" dur="6">what is going on with the economy and we</text>
  <text start="125.02" dur="4.83">can see that more and more corporations</text>
  <text start="127.479" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re laying off individuals and when</text>
  <text start="129.85" dur="4.32">I see something like this and we see a</text>
  <text start="131.799" dur="3.841">lot of retail stores closing a lot of</text>
  <text start="134.17" dur="3.539">corporations saying oh we&amp;#39;re going to go</text>
  <text start="135.64" dur="3.99">through restructuring we just don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="137.709" dur="2.641">the profits and we&amp;#39;re going to let some</text>
  <text start="139.63" dur="5.1">people go</text>
  <text start="140.35" dur="5.609">this reminds me of 2007 going into 2008</text>
  <text start="144.73" dur="4.02">where there were a lot of corporations</text>
  <text start="145.959" dur="5.4">laying off people it was very quiet at</text>
  <text start="148.75" dur="5.37">that point in time but it was happening</text>
  <text start="151.359" dur="5.13">they didn&amp;#39;t really televise it until the</text>
  <text start="154.12" dur="4.92">stock market fell down and I mean</text>
  <text start="156.489" dur="5.461">crashed and corporations were like woah</text>
  <text start="159.04" dur="5.19">hey now we can announce how many people</text>
  <text start="161.95" dur="4.56">were going to really layoffs and we saw</text>
  <text start="164.23" dur="4.589">a company after company just letting</text>
  <text start="166.51" dur="4.89">people go and we&amp;#39;re going to see the</text>
  <text start="168.819" dur="5.281">same thing but up until that period of</text>
  <text start="171.4" dur="4.919">time they were laying off individuals</text>
  <text start="174.1" dur="4.32">very quietly very slowly and they were</text>
  <text start="176.319" dur="3.39">giving reasons of why they were doing</text>
  <text start="178.42" dur="3.36">this we&amp;#39;re seeing that time right now</text>
  <text start="179.709" dur="5.011">they&amp;#39;re going to be cutting another 300</text>
  <text start="181.78" dur="5.67">jobs because they have falling</text>
  <text start="184.72" dur="4.879">circulation sales</text>
  <text start="187.45" dur="5.25">are not coming in like they used to</text>
  <text start="189.599" dur="5.561">revenue is not coming in toys-r-us</text>
  <text start="192.7" dur="4.41">they are in trouble net sales plunged by</text>
  <text start="195.16" dur="6.09">a hundred and thirteen million dollars</text>
  <text start="197.11" dur="6.75">and we received the retail numbers and</text>
  <text start="201.25" dur="4.349">remember how they calculate these retail</text>
  <text start="203.86" dur="4.05">numbers over time</text>
  <text start="205.599" dur="4.321">remember when stores shut down and they</text>
  <text start="207.91" dur="3.99">closed and they go bankrupt and the</text>
  <text start="209.92" dur="3.629">stores just don&amp;#39;t exist anymore they</text>
  <text start="211.9" dur="3.99">don&amp;#39;t say okay let&amp;#39;s cut it off</text>
  <text start="213.549" dur="4.8">they made no sales no they calculated</text>
  <text start="215.89" dur="5.01">out for the rest of the year to give us</text>
  <text start="218.349" dur="4.321">a slow slide to make it look like things</text>
  <text start="220.9" dur="3.99">aren&amp;#39;t really happening and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="222.67" dur="4.02">that bad but we can see that retail</text>
  <text start="224.89" dur="3.54">sales they have tumbled by 0.3 percent</text>
  <text start="226.69" dur="4.32">month on month this is the biggest drop</text>
  <text start="228.43" dur="5.85">since 2016 now let&amp;#39;s take a closer look</text>
  <text start="231.01" dur="5.809">at what is happening here we see retail</text>
  <text start="234.28" dur="6.59">and food services they are down negative</text>
  <text start="236.819" dur="7.301">0.3% motor-vehicle is down negative 0.2%</text>
  <text start="240.87" dur="7.69">we see electronics and applying stores</text>
  <text start="244.12" dur="6.81">down negative 2.8 percent gasoline</text>
  <text start="248.56" dur="5.13">stations down negative two point four</text>
  <text start="250.93" dur="6.6">percent sporting goods hobbies books</text>
  <text start="253.69" dur="5.31">music soars down negative 0.6% general</text>
  <text start="257.53" dur="4.37">merchandise stores department stores</text>
  <text start="259" dur="7.05">down negative 0.3% and department stores</text>
  <text start="261.9" dur="6.94">negative 1% miscellaneous stores</text>
  <text start="266.05" dur="5.97">negative 1.3 percent and we can see this</text>
  <text start="268.84" dur="5.97">is absolutely awful there is nothing</text>
  <text start="272.02" dur="5.82">good here whatsoever and this is going</text>
  <text start="274.81" dur="5.25">to continue throughout this year and it</text>
  <text start="277.84" dur="4.11">has been continuing since we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="280.06" dur="4.62">reporting it year after year and after</text>
  <text start="281.95" dur="4.35">year and like I said where everyone</text>
  <text start="284.68" dur="4.13">thought oh after the holiday season is</text>
  <text start="286.3" dur="6.089">going to be fantastic no it never</text>
  <text start="288.81" dur="7.06">happens we are in this trajectory of a</text>
  <text start="292.389" dur="6.5">downward spiral this is the retail</text>
  <text start="295.87" dur="5.13">apocalypse this is the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="298.889" dur="6.041">apocalypse this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="301" dur="6.919">right now this is the lead-up to the big</text>
  <text start="304.93" dur="5.64">one and it&amp;#39;s all falling apart</text>
  <text start="307.919" dur="5.68">GM right now will extend the typical</text>
  <text start="310.57" dur="4.71">summer shutdown at many of their us</text>
  <text start="313.599" dur="4.981">factories around the country</text>
  <text start="315.28" dur="5.849">why because of slumping sales bloated</text>
  <text start="318.58" dur="5.72">inventory their hot</text>
  <text start="321.129" dur="6.9">rique has basically come to an end and</text>
  <text start="324.3" dur="6.729">we can see that GM&amp;#39;s auto inventory in</text>
  <text start="328.029" dur="6.271">dealerships it&amp;#39;s continually moving up</text>
  <text start="331.029" dur="5.07">and up and up their channel stuffing we</text>
  <text start="334.3" dur="6.179">know how this works we discussed it many</text>
  <text start="336.099" dur="7.951">times before and we see GM once again is</text>
  <text start="340.479" dur="7.62">in big trouble so when we take all of</text>
  <text start="344.05" dur="6.239">this information and we take it and we</text>
  <text start="348.099" dur="5.58">look at it we can see that the second</text>
  <text start="350.289" dur="6.511">quarter GDP well that is in trouble</text>
  <text start="353.679" dur="3.811">this is falling like you&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="356.8" dur="3.69">before</text>
  <text start="357.49" dur="5.879">even though the Atlanta Fed the New York</text>
  <text start="360.49" dur="5.849">Fed they&amp;#39;re estimating that GDP is going</text>
  <text start="363.369" dur="6.78">to be around 4% you know 3.2 percent</text>
  <text start="366.339" dur="6.63">this is absolutely ridiculous because</text>
  <text start="370.149" dur="5.13">when we look at the hard data what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="372.969" dur="4.771">really going on in the economy we can</text>
  <text start="375.279" dur="5.25">see that it is just completely falling</text>
  <text start="377.74" dur="5.699">apart I mean there is not one piece of</text>
  <text start="380.529" dur="4.74">good economic data coming out and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="383.439" dur="4.68">not talking about the stock market at</text>
  <text start="385.269" dur="4.65">all what we&amp;#39;re looking at is what is</text>
  <text start="388.119" dur="3.63">really going on remember the GDP 70</text>
  <text start="389.919" dur="3.45">percent is made up of consumer spending</text>
  <text start="391.749" dur="4.58">and you have to remember in that</text>
  <text start="393.369" dur="6.121">consumer spending there is health care</text>
  <text start="396.329" dur="5.2">the Affordable Care Act and we need to</text>
  <text start="399.49" dur="4.5">remember something very important around</text>
  <text start="401.529" dur="3.45">two million people or so when they</text>
  <text start="403.99" dur="3.929">dropped out of it</text>
  <text start="404.979" dur="5.79">so there they won&amp;#39;t be spending those</text>
  <text start="407.919" dur="6.93">insurance premiums every month so that</text>
  <text start="410.769" dur="6.87">is also going to leave the second</text>
  <text start="414.849" dur="5.46">quarter GDP numbers and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="417.639" dur="5.851">show that consumer spending even lower</text>
  <text start="420.309" dur="4.5">than they&amp;#39;re actually reporting now so</text>
  <text start="423.49" dur="3.509">the whole thing is going to be a</text>
  <text start="424.809" dur="4.681">complete disaster and when we look at</text>
  <text start="426.999" dur="5.73">April business inventories they tumble</text>
  <text start="429.49" dur="5.189">by 0.2 percent in April and this is the</text>
  <text start="432.729" dur="5.55">biggest drop since November of 2015 and</text>
  <text start="434.679" dur="7.38">this does not help the second quarter</text>
  <text start="438.279" dur="6.9">GDP inventories to sales stagnated</text>
  <text start="442.059" dur="6.81">enable and they remain in recession</text>
  <text start="445.179" dur="6.72">signaling mode and again what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="448.869" dur="5.631">seeing is this huge collapse of the</text>
  <text start="451.899" dur="6.031">system actually bundes banks weed</text>
  <text start="454.5" dur="7.81">he&amp;#39;s out there saying that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="457.93" dur="5.73">approaching another crisis and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="462.31" dur="4.44">looking at it and he&amp;#39;s saying that we</text>
  <text start="463.66" dur="5.85">have one of the biggest asset bubbles in</text>
  <text start="466.75" dur="6.48">history and this is the head of the</text>
  <text start="469.51" dur="6.48">German central bank so think about what</text>
  <text start="473.23" dur="4.86">he&amp;#39;s saying here we have this huge asset</text>
  <text start="475.99" dur="5.13">bubble it&amp;#39;s the biggest one he&amp;#39;s ever</text>
  <text start="478.09" dur="5.46">seen and he&amp;#39;s saying it&amp;#39;s going to pop</text>
  <text start="481.12" dur="6.06">and the whole thing&amp;#39;s going to implode</text>
  <text start="483.55" dur="6.53">on itself now he did say something which</text>
  <text start="487.18" dur="6.66">was very interesting he said the culprit</text>
  <text start="490.08" dur="7.42">might be digital currencies such as</text>
  <text start="493.84" dur="6.99">Bitcoin because this could worsen the</text>
  <text start="497.5" dur="5.61">next financial crisis and this is a very</text>
  <text start="500.83" dur="4.92">interesting thing to say because right</text>
  <text start="503.11" dur="5.34">now many people don&amp;#39;t even have Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="505.75" dur="5.55">and we can see that what they&amp;#39;re worried</text>
  <text start="508.45" dur="5.16">about is that when this system comes</text>
  <text start="511.3" dur="6.869">down what they&amp;#39;re worried about is</text>
  <text start="513.61" dur="8.309">people piling into a crypto currency</text>
  <text start="518.169" dur="5.25">remember it&amp;#39;s not regulated the central</text>
  <text start="521.919" dur="5.461">bank does not control it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="523.419" dur="6.631">decentralized and basically it&amp;#39;s an open</text>
  <text start="527.38" dur="6.09">market and you can see by the way it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="530.05" dur="5.58">moving up and down naturally they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="533.47" dur="4.14">controlling it in any way and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="535.63" dur="4.23">worried that people when the system</text>
  <text start="537.61" dur="4.74">comes down people will pour out of</text>
  <text start="539.86" dur="5.04">dollars and they&amp;#39;ll go into the crypto</text>
  <text start="542.35" dur="4.56">market and what he&amp;#39;s saying is if people</text>
  <text start="544.9" dur="4.56">do do this and not just the dollar but</text>
  <text start="546.91" dur="4.86">the euro and all the other currencies</text>
  <text start="549.46" dur="6.27">around the world they&amp;#39;re saying that it</text>
  <text start="551.77" dur="6.12">will destroy the system and that will be</text>
  <text start="555.73" dur="4.8">the culprit of the destruction of the</text>
  <text start="557.89" dur="5.58">system that we see today well I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="560.53" dur="6.48">looking at the cryptocurrency as you</text>
  <text start="563.47" dur="5.61">know people are upset about the dollar</text>
  <text start="567.01" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re upset about the way the</text>
  <text start="569.08" dur="4.56">economies are run they&amp;#39;re upset about</text>
  <text start="571.15" dur="6.06">the central banks and people are using</text>
  <text start="573.64" dur="6">the cryptocurrency to move their assets</text>
  <text start="577.21" dur="4.44">now people are also putting that into</text>
  <text start="579.64" dur="3.39">silver and gold which is very important</text>
  <text start="581.65" dur="4.14">but we know that silver and gold right</text>
  <text start="583.03" dur="4.26">now are manipulated and what is</text>
  <text start="585.79" dur="2.469">happening right now is that the US</text>
  <text start="587.29" dur="3.37">government they&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="588.259" dur="4.74">look at this and they submitted a new</text>
  <text start="590.66" dur="5.31">bill and it was introduced on the floor</text>
  <text start="592.999" dur="5.9">of the US Senate entitled combating</text>
  <text start="595.97" dur="6.149">money laundering terrorist financing and</text>
  <text start="598.899" dur="4.6">counterfeiting act of 2017 and you know</text>
  <text start="602.119" dur="5.24">that this is not what it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="603.499" dur="7.02">now in there they&amp;#39;re saying cash is evil</text>
  <text start="607.359" dur="6.13">bitcoin is evil and they&amp;#39;re also saying</text>
  <text start="610.519" dur="5.701">pre-made prepaid mobile phones retail</text>
  <text start="613.489" dur="5.64">gift vouchers even electronic coupons</text>
  <text start="616.22" dur="5.489">they&amp;#39;re all evil because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="619.129" dur="5.76">your funds going into other places they</text>
  <text start="621.709" dur="6.75">want it where in the bank in digital</text>
  <text start="624.889" dur="7.88">form period and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="628.459" dur="6.15">that in this bill they basically said</text>
  <text start="632.769" dur="4">something about Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="634.609" dur="3.54">and you can tell from the bill and in</text>
  <text start="636.769" dur="3.51">the language in the bill they have</text>
  <text start="638.149" dur="4.5">really no idea how Bitcoin works</text>
  <text start="640.279" dur="4.74">remember there&amp;#39;s no central bank for</text>
  <text start="642.649" dur="5.25">Bitcoin there&amp;#39;s no chairman of Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="645.019" dur="7.29">Bitcoin is created through software it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="647.899" dur="7.41">decentralized so the Senate is trying to</text>
  <text start="652.309" dur="5.63">force the Bitcoin core software to</text>
  <text start="655.309" dur="5.7">comply with money laundering regulations</text>
  <text start="657.939" dur="4.81">the bill also attempts to drop a major</text>
  <text start="661.009" dur="4.29">bomb on Bitcoin by including it in the</text>
  <text start="662.749" dur="4.77">list of monetary instruments that must</text>
  <text start="665.299" dur="5.16">be reported when entering or leaving the</text>
  <text start="667.519" dur="4.94">u.s. so theoretically if you leave the</text>
  <text start="670.459" dur="4.891">US with more than 10,000 in Bitcoin or</text>
  <text start="672.459" dur="4.24">aetherium you&amp;#39;d have to confess this</text>
  <text start="675.35" dur="5.279">fact to the authorities</text>

  <text start="680.629" dur="4.591">or anything else they can think of so</text>
  <text start="683.509" dur="4.53">this bill is nothing more than another</text>
  <text start="685.22" dur="5.19">weapon in their ongoing war on cash and</text>
  <text start="688.039" dur="5.311">now they included crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="690.41" dur="5.909">they&amp;#39;re very worried about this now</text>
  <text start="693.35" dur="5.399">today the Fed came out and they did</text>
  <text start="696.319" dur="5.64">exactly what we thought they were going</text>
  <text start="698.749" dur="6.15">to do they raised the interest rates by</text>
  <text start="701.959" dur="5.641">a 25 basis point and when they looked at</text>
  <text start="704.899" dur="5.73">it they said well the data looks</text>
  <text start="707.6" dur="6.809">fantastic unemployment is fantastic the</text>
  <text start="710.629" dur="6.841">consumer is doing very very well the</text>
  <text start="714.409" dur="5.76">housing market is doing well we see very</text>
  <text start="717.47" dur="4.229">low inflation now we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="720.169" dur="3.39">all the data we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="721.699" dur="4.14">looking at all the information and we</text>
  <text start="723.559" dur="4.59">know that this is not true at all</text>
  <text start="725.839" dur="4.62">actually if we go back just a year ago</text>
  <text start="728.149" dur="5.31">the economic data that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="730.459" dur="5.16">looking at is worse than ever think</text>
  <text start="733.459" dur="4.23">about those individuals that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="735.619" dur="4.38">looking at the subprime securities and</text>
  <text start="737.689" dur="3.21">if you&amp;#39;ve seen the Big Short you would</text>
  <text start="739.999" dur="2.34">know what I&amp;#39;m talking about if you</text>
  <text start="740.899" dur="4.47">haven&amp;#39;t seen the Big Short see that</text>
  <text start="742.339" dur="5.4">movie they looked inside and they said</text>
  <text start="745.369" dur="4.171">what wait a minute is a rated triple-a</text>
  <text start="747.739" dur="3.87">but there&amp;#39;s all these individuals that</text>
  <text start="749.54" dur="5.399">are defaulting on the loans how could</text>
  <text start="751.609" dur="3.84">these be triple-a rated it makes no</text>
  <text start="754.939" dur="2.34">sense</text>
  <text start="755.449" dur="4.05">now they looked at this and they knew</text>
  <text start="757.279" dur="4.11">that they weren&amp;#39;t so they bet against</text>
  <text start="759.499" dur="4.14">them it took years before they were able</text>
  <text start="761.389" dur="4.2">to cash in on this people laughed at</text>
  <text start="763.639" dur="3.36">them and things like that but we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="765.589" dur="3.42">looking at the data we&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="766.999" dur="2.55">inside and we&amp;#39;re saying this doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="769.009" dur="2.82">make sense</text>
  <text start="769.549" dur="4.111">the economy is at full employment like</text>
  <text start="771.829" dur="4.081">they&amp;#39;re telling us they&amp;#39;re convincing us</text>
  <text start="773.66" dur="3.81">there&amp;#39;s no inflation and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="775.91" dur="3.149">scratching our head saying well that is</text>
  <text start="777.47" dur="3.57">true why are all these corporations</text>
  <text start="779.059" dur="3.45">laying off why is there&amp;#39;s no real</text>
  <text start="781.04" dur="4.169">revenue why aren&amp;#39;t their sales</text>
  <text start="782.509" dur="5.01">why are all these stores closing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="785.209" dur="5.73">not going to the online market what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="787.519" dur="6.51">happening here and we understand what is</text>
  <text start="790.939" dur="5.43">happening that just like those subprime</text>
  <text start="794.029" dur="6.24">security individuals that were looking</text>
  <text start="796.369" dur="7.17">inside of those securities we realize</text>
  <text start="800.269" dur="6.211">this is fake and what is happening here</text>
  <text start="803.539" dur="6.21">is that the Fed came out and they said</text>
  <text start="806.48" dur="5.969">we&amp;#39;re accelerating the process we</text>
  <text start="809.749" dur="5.34">realize that this economy is ripping</text>
  <text start="812.449" dur="5.401">itself apart we know it&amp;#39;s collapsing we</text>
  <text start="815.089" dur="4.44">know it&amp;#39;s not doing well and we&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="817.85" dur="4.019">nervous that there&amp;#39;s going to be some</text>
  <text start="819.529" dur="4.77">type of black swan we want to control</text>
  <text start="821.869" dur="4.95">the narrative and I think and I still</text>
  <text start="824.299" dur="5.07">think if they have their way they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="826.819" dur="3.841">going to try to bring down this economy</text>
  <text start="829.369" dur="3.9">and they&amp;#39;re going to try to do it in two</text>
  <text start="830.66" dur="4.289">parts the first part if they can control</text>
  <text start="833.269" dur="4.891">the narrative they&amp;#39;re going to blame</text>
  <text start="834.949" dur="6.48">this on Trump and say he&amp;#39;s the one who</text>
  <text start="838.16" dur="6.989">caused all of this and once they then</text>
  <text start="841.429" dur="5.97">start creating more stimulus trying to</text>
  <text start="845.149" dur="3.63">pump up the system well I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="847.399" dur="3.42">the rest of the world is going to look</text>
  <text start="848.779" dur="4.71">at this and say well we still trust you</text>
  <text start="850.819" dur="4.62">know they&amp;#39;re going to say hmm we saw how</text>
  <text start="853.489" dur="4.47">this worked last time and</text>
  <text start="855.439" dur="5.01">we don&amp;#39;t know if we can really trust all</text>
  <text start="857.959" dur="5.04">this but we know at this point the</text>
  <text start="860.449" dur="4.74">stimulus that they create it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="862.999" dur="4.38">to do that much they might even throw in</text>
  <text start="865.189" dur="4.95">universal basic income to get people</text>
  <text start="867.379" dur="4.08">spending in the retail market and we</text>
  <text start="870.139" dur="3.45">know that this will only last for a</text>
  <text start="871.459" dur="4.44">short period of time and this is why if</text>
  <text start="873.589" dur="4.71">they can control the narrative they will</text>
  <text start="875.899" dur="3.93">then have some type of an event some</text>
  <text start="878.299" dur="4.171">type of cyberattack where it hits the</text>
  <text start="879.829" dur="6.3">financial institutions a regional power</text>
  <text start="882.47" dur="5.459">grid outage and this way they can start</text>
  <text start="886.129" dur="4.41">the whole thing saying listen it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="887.929" dur="4.41">us we tried to bring it back up Trump</text>
  <text start="890.539" dur="3.931">wrote it down and now we have this other</text>
  <text start="892.339" dur="3.99">country or group that is really hitting</text>
  <text start="894.47" dur="5.549">the system and brought it down once</text>
  <text start="896.329" dur="5.55">again now Trump has the narrative he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="900.019" dur="4.38">going to try to maneuver this in a way</text>
  <text start="901.879" dur="4.17">where it&amp;#39;s not blame on any group or</text>
  <text start="904.399" dur="3.9">country it&amp;#39;s going to be blamed on the</text>
  <text start="906.049" dur="4.2">elite the deep state and the central</text>
  <text start="908.299" dur="3.99">bank and this is what he&amp;#39;s been trying</text>
  <text start="910.249" dur="5.78">to do and he&amp;#39;s trying to shift</text>
  <text start="912.289" dur="6.181">everything in his direction to try to</text>
  <text start="916.029" dur="4.72">control the narrative and this is where</text>
  <text start="918.47" dur="4.679">the battle is right now now something</text>
  <text start="920.749" dur="6.48">very interesting which I never thought</text>
  <text start="923.149" dur="6.571">I&amp;#39;d hear but Suze Orman was talking</text>
  <text start="927.229" dur="5.31">about the last recession and she was</text>
  <text start="929.72" dur="5.279">talking to people explaining them that</text>
  <text start="932.539" dur="5.91">hey we had this last recession it was</text>
  <text start="934.999" dur="6.721">terrible people lost their jobs and you</text>
  <text start="938.449" dur="6.48">need to be ready and prepared just in</text>
  <text start="941.72" dur="5.459">case this happens again now</text>
  <text start="944.929" dur="4.2">the central bank is out there the</text>
  <text start="947.179" dur="3.9">corporate media is out there they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="949.129" dur="3.57">telling you how great the economy is</text>
  <text start="951.079" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;ve been telling us that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="952.699" dur="6.271">in this recovery and she&amp;#39;s telling</text>
  <text start="955.489" dur="6.84">people that they should put away their</text>
  <text start="958.97" dur="5.509">funds keep it because we might be</text>
  <text start="962.329" dur="4.98">entering another type of economic</text>
  <text start="964.479" dur="6.991">situation she said this world is crazy</text>
  <text start="967.309" dur="6.96">and things happen in a crazy world and</text>
  <text start="971.47" dur="6.839">she also said the only way you can take</text>
  <text start="974.269" dur="7.56">the craziness out is to make yourself</text>
  <text start="978.309" dur="6.161">secure now she talked about losing your</text>
  <text start="981.829" dur="5.49">job she talked about actually prepping</text>
  <text start="984.47" dur="4.83">and getting prepared for another crisis</text>
  <text start="987.319" dur="4.401">which I find very</text>
  <text start="989.3" dur="5.94">interesting at this stage of the game</text>
  <text start="991.72" dur="6.429">because as we can see Obama handed off a</text>
  <text start="995.24" dur="4.59">healthy economy to trump and since that</text>
  <text start="998.149" dur="3.541">time they&amp;#39;ve been saying that the</text>
  <text start="999.83" dur="4.319">economy was doing fine we do see</text>
  <text start="1001.69" dur="5.639">rumblings now that the economy is not</text>
  <text start="1004.149" dur="4.771">doing as great as it was before and of</text>
  <text start="1007.329" dur="3.781">course this is the lead up to blame</text>
  <text start="1008.92" dur="3.87">Trump the Fed is out there telling you</text>
  <text start="1011.11" dur="4.919">how great it is they&amp;#39;re raising rates</text>
  <text start="1012.79" dur="7.58">and something we need to understand is</text>
  <text start="1016.029" dur="8.341">that when the Fed raises their rates</text>
  <text start="1020.37" dur="5.949">during a weakened stage of the economy</text>
  <text start="1024.37" dur="4.559">where it never recovered this is an</text>
  <text start="1026.319" dur="4.981">illusion what happens is and this is</text>
  <text start="1028.929" dur="5.01">according to Bank of America where</text>
  <text start="1031.3" dur="5.84">they&amp;#39;ve done this research and they</text>
  <text start="1033.939" dur="7.081">notice that every time the Fed is</text>
  <text start="1037.14" dur="6.699">determined to tighten it usually ends in</text>
  <text start="1041.02" dur="6.36">an event and they started to point it</text>
  <text start="1043.839" dur="8.451">out on their graph where they looked at</text>
  <text start="1047.38" dur="8.31">all different times 1980 to 1987 1990</text>
  <text start="1052.29" dur="6.519">2000 2007 and they said here we are</text>
  <text start="1055.69" dur="5.57">right now and if you noticed if you look</text>
  <text start="1058.809" dur="5.761">at the graph you can see that each time</text>
  <text start="1061.26" dur="6.07">they tightened they could never bring</text>
  <text start="1064.57" dur="4.68">the interest rate up to the last point</text>
  <text start="1067.33" dur="6.93">it got lower and lower let me give an</text>
  <text start="1069.25" dur="8.79">example back in 1987 the interest rates</text>
  <text start="1074.26" dur="5.58">were around 6% or so they started to</text>
  <text start="1078.04" dur="6.09">move the interest rates up when they</text>
  <text start="1079.84" dur="7.65">reached around 9% or so the economy came</text>
  <text start="1084.13" dur="7.289">down back in the 90s the interest rates</text>
  <text start="1087.49" dur="6.6">were around 2% or so they brought him up</text>
  <text start="1091.419" dur="8.161">to around 6 percent the economy came</text>
  <text start="1094.09" dur="8.7">down 2000 the same thing 2007 the</text>
  <text start="1099.58" dur="6.15">interest rates started at 1.5% they were</text>
  <text start="1102.79" dur="5.28">able to bring it up to around 4 point or</text>
  <text start="1105.73" dur="5.85">5 percent and then all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="1108.07" dur="7.08">economy came down here we are at very</text>
  <text start="1111.58" dur="6.15">close to 0% and they&amp;#39;re bringing the</text>
  <text start="1115.15" dur="5.43">rates up and it&amp;#39;s at one point two five</text>
  <text start="1117.73" dur="4.81">percent and I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1120.58" dur="4.36">get any higher than that before</text>
  <text start="1122.54" dur="5.01">or the entire system comes down maybe</text>
  <text start="1124.94" dur="6.02">they&amp;#39;ll have one more but we can see</text>
  <text start="1127.55" dur="6.15">already from the last one the economy is</text>
  <text start="1130.96" dur="5.65">accelerating to the downside we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1133.7" dur="5.49">seeing loan creation it is stalled it is</text>
  <text start="1136.61" dur="5.06">declining we see the credit impulse it</text>
  <text start="1139.19" dur="5.73">is gone deep into the negative territory</text>
  <text start="1141.67" dur="6.52">these are all the signs that are showing</text>
  <text start="1144.92" dur="6.63">us that this whole thing is about to</text>
  <text start="1148.19" dur="7.47">collapse the clock is ticking down get</text>
  <text start="1151.55" dur="6.69">prepared get ready because with a wink</text>
  <text start="1155.66" dur="4.71">of an eye one day you can be waking up</text>
  <text start="1158.24" dur="4.47">and all of a sudden you hear the stock</text>
  <text start="1160.37" dur="4.41">market is down by two thousand points</text>
  <text start="1162.71" dur="4.11">people are scrambling people are nervous</text>
  <text start="1164.78" dur="3.84">and you see it drop and drop and they</text>
  <text start="1166.82" dur="4.56">throw the switch and they stop the</text>
  <text start="1168.62" dur="4.35">market from going down and all of a</text>
  <text start="1171.38" dur="4.05">sudden you see corporations laying off</text>
  <text start="1172.97" dur="5.43">left and right and everyone is panicking</text>
  <text start="1175.43" dur="6.72">panicking at this point most likely this</text>
  <text start="1178.4" dur="5.52">will happen on a Friday so we need to</text>
