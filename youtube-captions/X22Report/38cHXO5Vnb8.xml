  <text start="92.81" dur="8.84">out of the banking system and at this</text>
  <text start="96.83" dur="8.49">point europe and the ECB they&amp;#39;re aware</text>
  <text start="101.65" dur="6.82">how insolvent the greek banks are and</text>
  <text start="105.32" dur="6.33">they realize that a new recap would need</text>
  <text start="108.47" dur="6.87">as little as 25 billion euros and as</text>
  <text start="111.65" dur="5.42">much as 50 billion euros so what are</text>
  <text start="115.34" dur="5.49">they looking to do at this point well</text>
  <text start="117.07" dur="5.98">they are looking to do balance now is</text>
  <text start="120.83" dur="3.57">this set in stone right now is this</text>
  <text start="123.05" dur="5.01">exactly what they&amp;#39;re going to do know</text>
  <text start="124.4" dur="6.15">they are looking at this germany is</text>
  <text start="128.06" dur="5.52">already demanding a ballon of large</text>
  <text start="130.55" dur="8.43">depositors those holding over the</text>
  <text start="133.58" dur="8.129">insured threshold of 100,000 euros this</text>
  <text start="138.98" dur="5.58">is a repeat of what happened in cyprus</text>
  <text start="141.709" dur="5.011">and we knew that this eventually was</text>
  <text start="144.56" dur="3.45">going to happen and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="146.72" dur="3.54">see signs of this because you have to</text>
  <text start="148.01" dur="4.11">remember greece is completely bankrupt</text>
  <text start="150.26" dur="7.14">most of the people took their money out</text>
  <text start="152.12" dur="7.53">of the banks and they need to restart</text>
  <text start="157.4" dur="5.25">the system and where are they going to</text>
  <text start="159.65" dur="4.77">find this money it&amp;#39;s nowhere to be found</text>
  <text start="162.65" dur="5.43">so they&amp;#39;re going to go in</text>
  <text start="164.42" dur="8.16">side to the banking system and this is</text>
  <text start="168.08" dur="8.7">why the eurozone United States Canada</text>
  <text start="172.58" dur="7.89">New Zealand Switzerland UK other</text>
  <text start="176.78" dur="7.679">countries this is why they created the</text>
  <text start="180.47" dur="6.63">bail-in document in situations like this</text>
  <text start="184.459" dur="6.871">because they know the government is not</text>
  <text start="187.1" dur="9.15">going to bail them out we see the brick</text>
  <text start="191.33" dur="7.409">banks AI the aiib they have pledged</text>
  <text start="196.25" dur="6.42">partnerships and like I mentioned before</text>
  <text start="198.739" dur="6.661">all loans will be issued in the u1 not</text>
  <text start="202.67" dur="6.539">the dollar they will bypass the dollar</text>
  <text start="205.4" dur="8.369">and we can see that at this point the</text>
  <text start="209.209" dur="6.03">dollar is continually losing steam they</text>
  <text start="213.769" dur="4.831">keep telling us the dollar is up</text>
  <text start="215.239" dur="6.181">everything is fine but here in the</text>
  <text start="218.6" dur="6.84">United States the dollar is continually</text>
  <text start="221.42" dur="5.64">losing its purchasing power every time</text>
  <text start="225.44" dur="4.549">you go to the store every time you</text>
  <text start="227.06" dur="6.209">purchase something those dollars</text>
  <text start="229.989" dur="5.951">purchase less and less and this is what</text>
  <text start="233.269" dur="5.31">we&amp;#39;re seeing since 1971 I mean the</text>
  <text start="235.94" dur="5.91">dollar has lost what 85 to 90 percent of</text>
  <text start="238.579" dur="8.94">its value but guess what if you look</text>
  <text start="241.85" dur="9.72">back in time since 1971 gold hasn&amp;#39;t lost</text>
  <text start="247.519" dur="7.681">its value it&amp;#39;s actually maintained its</text>
  <text start="251.57" dur="5.669">value yes it&amp;#39;s come down a little bit</text>
  <text start="255.2" dur="8.64">but if you compare to the dollar gold</text>
  <text start="257.239" dur="10.531">silver has sustained its purchasing</text>
  <text start="263.84" dur="5.699">power of course people are gonna come oh</text>
  <text start="267.77" dur="3.66">you can&amp;#39;t purchase anything for gold and</text>
  <text start="269.539" dur="5.851">silver yeah if you kept it you can trade</text>
  <text start="271.43" dur="5.489">it in for those paper dollars that are</text>
  <text start="275.39" dur="3.51">absolutely worth nothing and then you</text>
  <text start="276.919" dur="4.831">can go purchase so if you had a piece of</text>
  <text start="278.9" dur="7.38">silver if you had a piece of gold and</text>
  <text start="281.75" dur="8.639">you kept it throughout time the value of</text>
  <text start="286.28" dur="6.78">it with this dollar system if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="290.389" dur="7.221">comparing it to that has kept its value</text>
  <text start="293.06" dur="4.55">where the dollar has not</text>
  <text start="297.82" dur="7.18">we see right now that the Bank of</text>
  <text start="302.06" dur="6">International Settlement they have</text>
  <text start="305" dur="5.64">acknowledged in their annual report that</text>
  <text start="308.06" dur="7.08">the policy of cheap money has completely</text>
  <text start="310.64" dur="7.5">failed all the trillions of dollars that</text>
  <text start="315.14" dur="8.13">they created out of thin air produced no</text>
  <text start="318.14" dur="7.5">growth in the real economy and they want</text>
  <text start="323.27" dur="5.37">the governments of the world to resolve</text>
  <text start="325.64" dur="5.13">the crisis well the government&amp;#39;s are</text>
  <text start="328.64" dur="5.67">completely broke they can&amp;#39;t resolve the</text>
  <text start="330.77" dur="6.18">crisis this system that they created the</text>
  <text start="334.31" dur="4.53">central banking system where they create</text>
  <text start="336.95" dur="6.84">money out of thin air and they loan it</text>
  <text start="338.84" dur="8.19">out with interest on top of it as we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="343.79" dur="5.16">seen in Cyprus Greece France United</text>
  <text start="347.03" dur="6.39">States and many other countries it just</text>
  <text start="348.95" dur="7.44">cannot be sustained it you cannot keep</text>
  <text start="353.42" dur="6.81">this system going especially when you</text>
  <text start="356.39" dur="6.12">don&amp;#39;t have revenue coming in and this is</text>
  <text start="360.23" dur="5.04">what we see the 85th annual report</text>
  <text start="362.51" dur="5.25">analyzes the institution the situation</text>
  <text start="365.27" dur="4.41">of the global financial system seven</text>
  <text start="367.76" dur="5.43">years after the crisis they have an</text>
  <text start="369.68" dur="6.6">entire chapter devoted to biz and all</text>
  <text start="373.19" dur="6.48">the shortcomings of the IMF and other</text>
  <text start="376.28" dur="6.17">central banking systems and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="379.67" dur="6.75">saying that yeah it didn&amp;#39;t work it</text>
  <text start="382.45" dur="7.11">didn&amp;#39;t go to the everyday person it</text>
  <text start="386.42" dur="7.04">cannot be sustained it cannot work and</text>
  <text start="389.56" dur="6.82">something&amp;#39;s going to have to be done and</text>
  <text start="393.46" dur="4.24">we know what they&amp;#39;re going to do we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="396.38" dur="3.81">already discussed that many many times</text>
  <text start="397.7" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re going to go in to the banking</text>
  <text start="400.19" dur="6.9">system to take what they need to keep</text>
  <text start="402.77" dur="6.45">the system going we already know the</text>
  <text start="407.09" dur="4.8">system is crashing we already know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="409.22" dur="4.65">collapsing and we know there&amp;#39;s certain</text>
  <text start="411.89" dur="3.93">things are going to do before the</text>
  <text start="413.87" dur="4.68">collapse one of them they&amp;#39;ve been trying</text>
  <text start="415.82" dur="4.89">for many many years they&amp;#39;ve been trying</text>
  <text start="418.55" dur="3.39">to take away the weapons trying to</text>
  <text start="420.71" dur="3.42">convince everyone that you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="421.94" dur="5.04">the rights and President Obama on</text>
  <text start="424.13" dur="7.41">Thursday pledged to use his last 18</text>
  <text start="426.98" dur="7.5">months in office to work on gun control</text>
  <text start="431.54" dur="6.66">this is what they&amp;#39;re planning and we</text>
  <text start="434.48" dur="11.13">will most likely see more false flag</text>
  <text start="438.2" dur="9.54">events occur we see out in Ukraine we</text>
  <text start="445.61" dur="4.32">understand the u.s. is in their training</text>
  <text start="447.74" dur="3.66">they have been for quite a while the</text>
  <text start="449.93" dur="3.39">training the National Guard training the</text>
  <text start="451.4" dur="7.52">Regular Army now training the police</text>
  <text start="453.32" dur="9.12">force and at this point they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="458.92" dur="5.92">the head of the National Police Force</text>
  <text start="462.44" dur="5.4">might be headed up by a foreigner</text>
  <text start="464.84" dur="6.06">someone from not even from Ukraine well</text>
  <text start="467.84" dur="4.68">this makes it easier to come down hard</text>
  <text start="470.9" dur="4.8">on the people because it&amp;#39;s not your</text>
  <text start="472.52" dur="7.23">people and we see this happening in many</text>
  <text start="475.7" dur="7.14">different countries so at this point in</text>
  <text start="479.75" dur="5.64">time what are we seeing we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="482.84" dur="4.92">inside Ukraine they&amp;#39;re locking</text>
  <text start="485.39" dur="4.65">everything down bringing it in</text>
  <text start="487.76" dur="4.8">foreigners selling off pieces of the</text>
  <text start="490.04" dur="4.83">country well the selling off pieces of</text>
  <text start="492.56" dur="5.19">the country in Greece to why because</text>
  <text start="494.87" dur="4.92">both of these countries are defaulting</text>
  <text start="497.75" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re collapsing they&amp;#39;re bankrupt they</text>
  <text start="499.79" dur="3.87">have nothing in the central bankers come</text>
  <text start="501.23" dur="5.97">in and they buy up whatever they want</text>
  <text start="503.66" dur="7.08">for pennies on the dollar we understand</text>
  <text start="507.2" dur="7.41">out in Syria the situation is escalating</text>
  <text start="510.74" dur="6.54">right now and Turkey definitely wants a</text>
  <text start="514.61" dur="6.78">complete no-fly zone in the area because</text>
  <text start="517.28" dur="5.94">it benefits them it&amp;#39;s crucial for turkey</text>
  <text start="521.39" dur="5.76">united states and the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="523.22" dur="7.5">to have this no-fly zone over the safe</text>
  <text start="527.15" dur="5.55">zone because this will help them get</text>
  <text start="530.72" dur="4.17">Assad think about it why do they need a</text>
  <text start="532.7" dur="5.13">no-fly zone with the Islamic state they</text>
  <text start="534.89" dur="5.97">don&amp;#39;t have planes what&amp;#39;s the purpose of</text>
  <text start="537.83" dur="5.43">it they don&amp;#39;t need it but this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="540.86" dur="4.92">their plan their goal has always been</text>
  <text start="543.26" dur="5.55">and always will be the same to remove</text>
  <text start="545.78" dur="6.72">Assad one way or another yes can they do</text>
  <text start="548.81" dur="6.66">it politically like Iran they might try</text>
  <text start="552.5" dur="4.98">that but they&amp;#39;ve been trying for years</text>
  <text start="555.47" dur="5.03">to completely remove him they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="557.48" dur="5.13">him to be part of this government</text>
  <text start="560.5" dur="4.99">because he has a close relationship with</text>
  <text start="562.61" dur="6.72">Russia and this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="565.49" dur="6.39">problem and we can see at this time old</text>
  <text start="569.33" dur="5.1">is talk about you know turkey going</text>
  <text start="571.88" dur="5.7">after the Kurds and doing all this this</text>
  <text start="574.43" dur="6.33">whole thing is a smokescreen their main</text>
  <text start="577.58" dur="7.59">objective is to go after Assad they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="580.76" dur="6.69">wanted this for a long time the US has</text>
  <text start="585.17" dur="4.56">wanted this for a long time the</text>
  <text start="587.45" dur="3.69">coalition forces have wanted this for a</text>
  <text start="589.73" dur="3.9">long time so what are they doing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="591.14" dur="5.16">keeping the propaganda continually</text>
  <text start="593.63" dur="7.13">flowing and they&amp;#39;re talking about the</text>
  <text start="596.3" dur="7.8">chlorine gas how it&amp;#39;s taking its toll in</text>
  <text start="600.76" dur="4.99">Syria and they&amp;#39;re coming back to the</text>
  <text start="604.1" dur="4.32">barrel bombs how they&amp;#39;re filled up with</text>
  <text start="605.75" dur="4.14">chlorine and they&amp;#39;re exploding it over</text>
  <text start="608.42" dur="4.2">the people but if you really look at</text>
  <text start="609.89" dur="8.34">this there is absolutely no evidence</text>
  <text start="612.62" dur="8.55">whatsoever of Assad dropping barrel</text>
  <text start="618.23" dur="6.54">bombs on the people I mean they have</text>
  <text start="621.17" dur="6.27">some fuzzy pictures out on the net you</text>
  <text start="624.77" dur="5.61">don&amp;#39;t know where these are taken you</text>
  <text start="627.44" dur="3.99">don&amp;#39;t know who&amp;#39;s dropping a rusty ballon</text>
  <text start="630.38" dur="4.649">first of all why would they even use a</text>
  <text start="631.43" dur="6.3">rusty barrel makes no sense and this is</text>
  <text start="635.029" dur="4.861">part of their disinformation because</text>
  <text start="637.73" dur="5.12">they said so everyone must believe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="639.89" dur="8.1">true and we&amp;#39;re getting reports that yeah</text>
  <text start="642.85" dur="7.33">none of this is true just like they told</text>
  <text start="647.99" dur="5.61">us that Assad was using sarin gas and we</text>
  <text start="650.18" dur="6.93">found out the free syrian army had sarin</text>
  <text start="653.6" dur="5.67">gas and caves MIT did a calculation and</text>
  <text start="657.11" dur="3.599">the only place it could come from was</text>
  <text start="659.27" dur="5.939">the Free Syrian Army and this was back</text>
  <text start="660.709" dur="6.931">in 2013 but Assad got rid of old his gas</text>
  <text start="665.209" dur="4.471">so all they have left is to say yeah</text>
  <text start="667.64" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s chlorine gas and then we find out</text>
  <text start="669.68" dur="3.81">no the human rights organization found</text>
  <text start="672.02" dur="4.11">out no it was the Islamic state that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="673.49" dur="6.81">using chlorine gas but really they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="676.13" dur="7.709">kind of keep that on the down-low they</text>
  <text start="680.3" dur="5.58">like to continually say it&amp;#39;s Assad he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="683.839" dur="6.901">using it on his own people and of course</text>
  <text start="685.88" dur="6.81">it makes no sense whatsoever and we see</text>
  <text start="690.74" dur="6.15">at this point in time Assad is giving</text>
  <text start="692.69" dur="6.389">amnesty to army deserters he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="696.89" dur="2.6">build up his forces this battle has been</text>
  <text start="699.079" dur="4.88">going</text>
  <text start="699.49" dur="7.62">for a long time it looks like his forces</text>
  <text start="703.959" dur="6.961">are getting tired he&amp;#39;s looking for more</text>
  <text start="707.11" dur="6.24">forces and the u.s. coalition forces</text>
  <text start="710.92" dur="4.7">they realize this and it seems like</text>
  <text start="713.35" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re ready to make their move</text>
  <text start="715.62" dur="4.51">especially with the United States now</text>
  <text start="717.88" dur="5.28">using bases in Turkey setting up a</text>
  <text start="720.13" dur="6.98">partial no-fly zone using the cover</text>
  <text start="723.16" dur="7.17">story about Kurds and everything else</text>
  <text start="727.11" dur="5.86">but their goal has always been the same</text>
  <text start="730.33" dur="4.53">to remove Assad one way or another I</text>
  <text start="732.97" dur="5.01">mean they tried politically once before</text>
  <text start="734.86" dur="4.95">with the Geneva 2 talks but the only</text>
  <text start="737.98" dur="3.75">thing that was on the table was Assad</text>
  <text start="739.81" dur="4.32">must step down and now we see the</text>
