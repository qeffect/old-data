  <text start="106.99" dur="5.14">being broadcast out to the public and a</text>
  <text start="110.69" dur="3.87">lot of companies their earnings are not</text>
  <text start="112.13" dur="4.23">looking that great now these</text>
  <text start="114.56" dur="3.63">corporations they&amp;#39;ve been downsizing</text>
  <text start="116.36" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;ve been laying off people they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="118.19" dur="4.319">been shutting manufacturing plants</text>
  <text start="120.08" dur="3.959">they&amp;#39;ve been doing stock buyback but</text>
  <text start="122.509" dur="4.291">doing everything they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="124.039" dur="4.741">make their company look profitable and</text>
  <text start="126.8" dur="3.569">we&amp;#39;re starting to see that a lot of</text>
  <text start="128.78" dur="4.98">companies well they&amp;#39;re running out of</text>
  <text start="130.369" dur="6.2">ammunition to keep the illusion that</text>
  <text start="133.76" dur="7.02">they are profitable remember they need</text>
  <text start="136.569" dur="6.701">sales to stay profitable yes they can do</text>
  <text start="140.78" dur="4.02">a buyback of stocks they can close</text>
  <text start="143.27" dur="4.56">manufacturing plants they can layoff</text>
  <text start="144.8" dur="5.37">people but that will not make them</text>
  <text start="147.83" dur="4.26">profitable maybe in that quarter but</text>
  <text start="150.17" dur="4.26">long-term if they don&amp;#39;t have the sales</text>
  <text start="152.09" dur="3.869">coming in they&amp;#39;ll have to continually</text>
  <text start="154.43" dur="4.77">cut and cut and cut until there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="155.959" dur="6.091">nothing left we see Cisco right now that</text>
  <text start="159.2" dur="4.619">their revenue well it is plunged between</text>
  <text start="162.05" dur="5.36">four and six percent now Wall Street</text>
  <text start="163.819" dur="6.75">they were expecting a modest 1% drop and</text>
  <text start="167.41" dur="5.829">they&amp;#39;re looking at their sales their</text>
  <text start="170.569" dur="5.7">revenue and they&amp;#39;re saying well in the</text>
  <text start="173.239" dur="6.03">future we&amp;#39;re not seeing any type of</text>
  <text start="176.269" dur="5.791">improvement actually we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="179.269" dur="5.911">a decline of revenue moving forward now</text>
  <text start="182.06" dur="4.47">the strange thing is they really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="185.18" dur="3.18">give an explanation of</text>
  <text start="186.53" dur="4.679">why they thought this was going to</text>
  <text start="188.36" dur="4.709">happen now of course most likely they</text>
  <text start="191.209" dur="3.451">were holding back to say that well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="193.069" dur="3.631">because of the economy it&amp;#39;s not doing</text>
  <text start="194.66" dur="3.93">well and corporations that are out there</text>
  <text start="196.7" dur="3.48">that are buying our products they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="198.59" dur="3.72">really purchasing as much as they used</text>
  <text start="200.18" dur="3.87">to and we notice a lot of corporations</text>
  <text start="202.31" dur="3.84">they don&amp;#39;t like saying that the economy</text>
  <text start="204.05" dur="4.35">is not doing well until the very end</text>
  <text start="206.15" dur="5.64">where everything really starts to fall</text>
  <text start="208.4" dur="6">apart now when Trump was taking office</text>
  <text start="211.79" dur="4.56">he was promising that jobs would be</text>
  <text start="214.4" dur="4.5">coming back to the United States now</text>
  <text start="216.35" dur="4.56">this doesn&amp;#39;t mean that jobs and</text>
  <text start="218.9" dur="5.4">manufacturing that they&amp;#39;re coming back</text>
  <text start="220.91" dur="5.82">now this is not the economy that will be</text>
  <text start="224.3" dur="4.71">able to support this what he was talking</text>
  <text start="226.73" dur="4.74">about was later on now everyone thought</text>
  <text start="229.01" dur="3.63">wow since he mentioned it all these jobs</text>
  <text start="231.47" dur="2.94">are coming back and I know he was</text>
  <text start="232.64" dur="3.84">tweeting out there that look this</text>
  <text start="234.41" dur="4.32">company promised this this company</text>
  <text start="236.48" dur="4.74">promised 10,000 this company promised</text>
  <text start="238.73" dur="5.729">15,000 these were just promises they</text>
  <text start="241.22" dur="6.48">didn&amp;#39;t do anything and what we can see</text>
  <text start="244.459" dur="7.111">right now is that car sales well they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="247.7" dur="6.93">been declining we see that a lot of the</text>
  <text start="251.57" dur="5.58">automobile manufacturers well it looks</text>
  <text start="254.63" dur="7.53">like things are not going well for them</text>
  <text start="257.15" dur="8.04">and they&amp;#39;re going back on their promise</text>
  <text start="262.16" dur="4.71">they said they can&amp;#39;t do it at this time</text>
  <text start="265.19" dur="3.78">they cannot bring the amount of workers</text>
  <text start="266.87" dur="4.22">that they said into the country they</text>
  <text start="268.97" dur="4.92">can&amp;#39;t boost manufacturing right</text>
  <text start="271.09" dur="5.32">manufacturing right now and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="273.89" dur="4.23">starting to see that GM and Ford well</text>
  <text start="276.41" dur="5.84">they&amp;#39;re making cuts to their US</text>
  <text start="278.12" dur="7.169">workforces and right now it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="282.25" dur="5.56">impossibility because this economy that</text>
  <text start="285.289" dur="4.711">we are in right now it cannot support it</text>
  <text start="287.81" dur="4.79">actually auto sales right now they have</text>
  <text start="290" dur="6.09">fallen for four straight months in a row</text>
  <text start="292.6" dur="7.09">inventory is near record highs use car</text>
  <text start="296.09" dur="5.49">sales prices are falling and R&amp;amp;D budgets</text>
  <text start="299.69" dur="4.32">have become bloated and interest rates</text>
  <text start="301.58" dur="5.61">are half a percentage point higher than</text>
  <text start="304.01" dur="6.42">they were five months ago and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="307.19" dur="6.289">starting to see that they can&amp;#39;t make it</text>
  <text start="310.43" dur="5.76">and what is happening is a complete</text>
  <text start="313.479" dur="6.161">implosion of the automobile</text>
  <text start="316.19" dur="3.81">manufacturers we saw this back when -</text>
  <text start="319.64" dur="2.22">five</text>
  <text start="320" dur="4.08">and eight we&amp;#39;re starting to see the same</text>
  <text start="321.86" dur="3.81">thing once again and those individuals</text>
  <text start="324.08" dur="3.54">who are delinquent on their older loans</text>
  <text start="325.67" dur="4.02">of those people who are defaulting on</text>
  <text start="327.62" dur="3.69">their auto loans those cars are also</text>
  <text start="329.69" dur="4.56">coming back a lot of people coming off</text>
  <text start="331.31" dur="5.91">of leases the whole thing is a complete</text>
  <text start="334.25" dur="7.1">nightmare the housing market is in the</text>
  <text start="337.22" dur="6.87">same exact area where the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="341.35" dur="5.38">imploding on itself we saw that mortgage</text>
  <text start="344.09" dur="5.34">applications they were down but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="346.73" dur="5.34">more important about this is that this</text>
  <text start="349.43" dur="5.13">is not a one-off thing this continually</text>
  <text start="352.07" dur="4.98">happens where mortgage applications</text>
  <text start="354.56" dur="5.25">continually decline and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="357.05" dur="5.94">declining faster than the little pop ups</text>
  <text start="359.81" dur="5.16">here and there which means the American</text>
  <text start="362.99" dur="3.66">person the everyday American person</text>
  <text start="364.97" dur="3.36">those individuals that are coming out of</text>
  <text start="366.65" dur="3.63">college those individuals that are</text>
  <text start="368.33" dur="3.93">looking to purchase a house they just</text>
  <text start="370.28" dur="4.139">can&amp;#39;t do it actually if you look around</text>
  <text start="372.26" dur="3.33">on Zillow and you look at all the</text>
  <text start="374.419" dur="3.661">different areas you can see a lot of</text>
  <text start="375.59" dur="4.47">houses they are for sale right now and</text>
  <text start="378.08" dur="3.18">you&amp;#39;ll see because their little red dots</text>
  <text start="380.06" dur="3.3">all over the place and if you start</text>
  <text start="381.26" dur="3.719">looking at them very very closely you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="383.36" dur="3.93">start to see that many of the homes</text>
  <text start="384.979" dur="5.161">they&amp;#39;ve been on the market for a long</text>
  <text start="387.29" dur="6.6">time I mean I&amp;#39;m talking months now every</text>
  <text start="390.14" dur="5.25">area is not the same some areas are</text>
  <text start="393.89" dur="4.02">doing a little bit better than others</text>
  <text start="395.39" dur="4.71">but what happens is as I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="397.91" dur="4.85">tracking all of this it&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="400.1" dur="4.59">spreading to more and more areas and</text>
  <text start="402.76" dur="3.52">something else that&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="404.69" dur="4.289">that has to do with the job market I</text>
  <text start="406.28" dur="6.3">know a couple of individuals that work</text>
  <text start="408.979" dur="7.321">in the New York area and they have firms</text>
  <text start="412.58" dur="6.12">that basically help tech individuals get</text>
  <text start="416.3" dur="4.5">jobs in other firms either as a</text>
  <text start="418.7" dur="3.45">consultant or a full-time job lately</text>
  <text start="420.8" dur="3.14">they&amp;#39;ve been doing a lot of consultant</text>
  <text start="422.15" dur="4.44">work because there&amp;#39;s not a lot of</text>
  <text start="423.94" dur="4.87">full-time jobs out there but what</text>
  <text start="426.59" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;ve noticed in the last six months</text>
  <text start="428.81" dur="5.1">or so and they saying it&amp;#39;s gotten worse</text>
  <text start="431.09" dur="4.29">in the last month and a half jobs are</text>
  <text start="433.91" dur="5.28">drying up and actually they can&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="435.38" dur="7.47">get individuals out on interviews and</text>
  <text start="439.19" dur="6.479">they have all these people just idle and</text>
  <text start="442.85" dur="4.8">there&amp;#39;s nowhere to put them and what</text>
  <text start="445.669" dur="4.081">that means is if they&amp;#39;re not out there</text>
  <text start="447.65" dur="5.61">working and usually these individuals</text>
  <text start="449.75" dur="4.11">get a per hour rate those individuals</text>
  <text start="453.26" dur="3.24">that play</text>
  <text start="453.86" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re not getting paid either and I</text>
  <text start="456.5" dur="3.27">was talking to them the other day and</text>
  <text start="457.97" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re saying that this is a really big</text>
  <text start="459.77" dur="3.21">problem and they&amp;#39;re a little nervous</text>
  <text start="461.6" dur="2.55">about what&amp;#39;s happening in the economy</text>
  <text start="462.98" dur="2.37">because when they look at the</text>
  <text start="464.15" dur="2.58">unemployment rate they&amp;#39;re saying well</text>
  <text start="465.35" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;re down to four point four percent I</text>
  <text start="466.73" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t understand why this is a problem</text>
  <text start="468.95" dur="4.59">right now now we&amp;#39;ve been looking at this</text>
  <text start="471.2" dur="5.49">for a very long time and we understand</text>
  <text start="473.54" dur="5.04">and we know that this whole entire</text>
  <text start="476.69" dur="3.96">unemployment number is completely fake</text>
  <text start="478.58" dur="3.3">phony and false same thing with the</text>
  <text start="480.65" dur="3.06">housing numbers same thing with the</text>
  <text start="481.88" dur="3.75">retail numbers what they do is they</text>
  <text start="483.71" dur="3.98">manipulate all these numbers to make you</text>
  <text start="485.63" dur="4.44">think that the economy is doing well</text>
  <text start="487.69" dur="5.71">even though when we look at it and we</text>
  <text start="490.07" dur="5.73">strip away all the manipulation we can</text>
  <text start="493.4" dur="4.2">see what is really going on and then the</text>
  <text start="495.8" dur="3.6">other thing that we see when we go</text>
  <text start="497.6" dur="3.33">around and we drive around or we talk to</text>
  <text start="499.4" dur="4.19">other people we can see that things are</text>
  <text start="500.93" dur="5.61">rapidly falling apart very very quickly</text>
  <text start="503.59" dur="5.53">but everyone doesn&amp;#39;t like to admit this</text>
  <text start="506.54" dur="4.2">actually I remember back in 2008 when</text>
  <text start="509.12" dur="3.54">the crisis was hitting and the stock</text>
  <text start="510.74" dur="3.27">market was falling people were losing</text>
  <text start="512.66" dur="3.6">their jobs even the people in the</text>
  <text start="514.01" dur="4.92">neighborhoods no one wanted to admit if</text>
  <text start="516.26" dur="3.84">they were working or not working and you</text>
  <text start="518.93" dur="3.39">could see more and more individuals</text>
  <text start="520.1" dur="4.5">staying home because they were out of</text>
  <text start="522.32" dur="4.29">work but no one was outside saying hey I</text>
  <text start="524.6" dur="4.47">was laid off were you laid off it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="526.61" dur="4.71">like that it was very very quiet nobody</text>
  <text start="529.07" dur="4.29">wanted to admit anything and I think the</text>
  <text start="531.32" dur="3.99">same thing is happening once again where</text>
  <text start="533.36" dur="3.36">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people who have been</text>
  <text start="535.31" dur="4.43">laid off a lot of people looking for</text>
  <text start="536.72" dur="5.94">work who changed work getting a lower</text>
  <text start="539.74" dur="6.28">salary or taking on a part-time job or</text>
  <text start="542.66" dur="5.55">can&amp;#39;t find a full-time job and no one is</text>
  <text start="546.02" dur="3.45">really talking about it everyone just</text>
  <text start="548.21" dur="2.85">staying quiet about it</text>
  <text start="549.47" dur="4.8">because a lot of people get embarrassed</text>
  <text start="551.06" dur="5.34">by this so what is happening in the</text>
  <text start="554.27" dur="5.94">economy right now is that the whole</text>
  <text start="556.4" dur="6.66">entire system is breaking apart and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="560.21" dur="6.14">accelerating right now we see the Philly</text>
  <text start="563.06" dur="5.79">Fed right now well this has basically</text>
  <text start="566.35" dur="5.11">smashed all expectations</text>
  <text start="568.85" dur="7.11">it&amp;#39;s shot up but the strange thing about</text>
  <text start="571.46" dur="7.31">it is that employment dropped new orders</text>
  <text start="575.96" dur="6.72">dropped prices paid dropped but</text>
  <text start="578.77" dur="7.57">shipments surged which is kind of odd</text>
  <text start="582.68" dur="4.98">and we can see right now that most</text>
  <text start="586.34" dur="3.06">likely the neck</text>
  <text start="587.66" dur="4.17">go around we&amp;#39;re going to see the Philly</text>
  <text start="589.4" dur="5.91">Fed plummet just like all the other</text>
  <text start="591.83" dur="6.54">indicators now Trump is getting ready to</text>
  <text start="595.31" dur="5.52">push forward the NAFTA renegotiations</text>
  <text start="598.37" dur="7.26">he&amp;#39;s letting light Houser go ahead with</text>
  <text start="600.83" dur="8.28">the renegotiations and this is a 100 day</text>
  <text start="605.63" dur="5.94">or 90 day notification to Congress</text>
  <text start="609.11" dur="3.96">letting them know that they are about to</text>
  <text start="611.57" dur="3.72">do this and we&amp;#39;ll have to see how that</text>
  <text start="613.07" dur="5.76">all works out now something very</text>
  <text start="615.29" dur="7.29">interesting is that Congress they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="618.83" dur="5.7">looking at 401 k&amp;#39;s right now and we can</text>
  <text start="622.58" dur="4.77">see right now with surveys that are out</text>
  <text start="624.53" dur="6">there polls that are out there that 75%</text>
  <text start="627.35" dur="5.16">of Americans disapprove of the job our</text>
  <text start="630.53" dur="5.22">representatives are doing and the reason</text>
  <text start="632.51" dur="6.84">why I wanted to mention this is because</text>
  <text start="635.75" dur="6.15">while only about 13% of US employees</text>
  <text start="639.35" dur="7.23">nationwide enjoy a retirement fund that</text>
  <text start="641.9" dur="7.77">assures a stable lifelong income all 535</text>
  <text start="646.58" dur="6.69">members of Congress do now of course</text>
  <text start="649.67" dur="6.75">this is courtesy of Uncle Sam members of</text>
  <text start="653.27" dur="4.92">Congress they participate in a Federal</text>
  <text start="656.42" dur="4.08">Employees Retirement System which</text>
  <text start="658.19" dur="4.67">provides pension benefits of which most</text>
  <text start="660.5" dur="4.98">American workers can only dream of</text>
  <text start="662.86" dur="4.72">private retirement savers often pay</text>
  <text start="665.48" dur="4.77">management fees that exceed 1% annually</text>
  <text start="667.58" dur="5.91">on a lousy investment choice members of</text>
  <text start="670.25" dur="5.99">Congress well they pay a maximum of</text>
  <text start="673.49" dur="6.42">point zero three nine percent for funds</text>
  <text start="676.24" dur="5.89">guaranteed to match the market and of</text>
  <text start="679.91" dur="3.87">course this was explained away in the</text>
  <text start="682.13" dur="3.06">beginning because they said well</text>
  <text start="683.78" dur="3.75">government workers they don&amp;#39;t make that</text>
  <text start="685.19" dur="4.56">much and they get you know health</text>
  <text start="687.53" dur="3.81">benefits they get retirement because</text>
  <text start="689.75" dur="3.99">their salaries are very very low</text>
  <text start="691.34" dur="4.02">actually today government employees are</text>
  <text start="693.74" dur="5.49">making more than in the private industry</text>
  <text start="695.36" dur="7.53">so that whole entire argument doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="699.23" dur="7.08">pan out anymore we also see there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="702.89" dur="5.58">proposal out in Washington and what they</text>
  <text start="706.31" dur="4.47">want to do they want to end the tax</text>
  <text start="708.47" dur="5.49">deductibility of your pension</text>
  <text start="710.78" dur="6.74">contributions so they can give a 1.5</text>
  <text start="713.96" dur="6.33">billion tax break to US corporations</text>
  <text start="717.52" dur="4.03">Congress is reportedly considering</text>
  <text start="720.29" dur="4.29">whether reduce the</text>
  <text start="721.55" dur="5.31">of contributing to a 401k and similar</text>
  <text start="724.58" dur="5.37">retirement plans the new proposal we</text>
  <text start="726.86" dur="5.64">treat all 401ks and traditional IRA</text>
  <text start="729.95" dur="5.67">contributions as if they were but they</text>
  <text start="732.5" dur="5.22">were wroth and IRA contributions you</text>
  <text start="735.62" dur="5.219">lose the tax exclusion of those</text>
  <text start="737.72" dur="5.34">contributions but your future 401k IRA</text>
  <text start="740.839" dur="4.651">earnings and appreciation would be</text>
  <text start="743.06" dur="4.23">tax-free something this would this could</text>
  <text start="745.49" dur="5.159">raise about 1.5 trillion in additional</text>
  <text start="747.29" dur="6.39">tax revenue over the next decade well</text>
  <text start="750.649" dur="5.851">unless they decide to tax retirement</text>
  <text start="753.68" dur="6.45">earnings and appreciation - but right</text>
  <text start="756.5" dur="6.48">now any income and gains your 401k or</text>
  <text start="760.13" dur="5.61">traditional IRA generate don&amp;#39;t get taxed</text>
  <text start="762.98" dur="5.07">until you make withdrawals but in but</text>
  <text start="765.74" dur="4.71">this proposal would impose a fifteen</text>
  <text start="768.05" dur="5.52">percent tax on those annual gains</text>
  <text start="770.45" dur="5.85">raising another 1.5 trillion over the</text>
  <text start="773.57" dur="4.86">next decade it&amp;#39;s not really a question</text>
  <text start="776.3" dur="2.64">of whether retirement plans will get a</text>
  <text start="778.43" dur="4.62">haircut</text>
  <text start="778.94" dur="8.31">but how much and we can see that of</text>
  <text start="783.05" dur="6.42">course Congress well they&amp;#39;re safe if you</text>
  <text start="787.25" dur="5.25">notice the government always does things</text>
  <text start="789.47" dur="5.19">to the people they never touch what they</text>
  <text start="792.5" dur="6.66">have and they want you to accept</text>
  <text start="794.66" dur="6.54">anything they do and again it&amp;#39;s one set</text>
  <text start="799.16" dur="4.44">of rules for them and another set of</text>
  <text start="801.2" dur="4.71">rules for the people and again you have</text>
  <text start="803.6" dur="4.59">to remember the government is looking to</text>
  <text start="805.91" dur="5.76">get revenue they don&amp;#39;t have enough</text>
  <text start="808.19" dur="5.55">revenue coming in to support this debt</text>
  <text start="811.67" dur="4.77">to support the interest on the debt to</text>
  <text start="813.74" dur="5.57">support everything they&amp;#39;re doing this is</text>
  <text start="816.44" dur="6.74">why they continually need more and more</text>
  <text start="819.31" dur="6.94">taxes and the cycle will never end</text>
  <text start="823.18" dur="4.87">now deutsche bank they&amp;#39;re being sued for</text>
  <text start="826.25" dur="4.77">running an international criminal</text>
  <text start="828.05" dur="5.039">organization and there&amp;#39;s an italian</text>
  <text start="831.02" dur="4.259">court that&amp;#39;s bringing them up on charges</text>
  <text start="833.089" dur="4.201">and we know that all these banks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="835.279" dur="6.151">doing money laundering they&amp;#39;re part of</text>
  <text start="837.29" dur="7.289">crime they&amp;#39;re using it for drug</text>
  <text start="841.43" dur="5.37">laundering all these banks are doing the</text>
  <text start="844.579" dur="5.461">same exact thing it&amp;#39;s not just deutsche</text>
  <text start="846.8" dur="7.2">bank it&amp;#39;s hsbc and many others and we</text>
  <text start="850.04" dur="5.41">can see that more and more governments</text>
  <text start="854" dur="4.78">they&amp;#39;re starting to real</text>
  <text start="855.45" dur="6.24">what these banks are actually doing now</text>
  <text start="858.78" dur="6.18">something very interesting the market</text>
  <text start="861.69" dur="5.52">fell by like 372 points yesterday but</text>
  <text start="864.96" dur="4.82">the corporate media started a new</text>
  <text start="867.21" dur="5">campaign which I find very interesting</text>
  <text start="869.78" dur="5.5">where they&amp;#39;re out there and this is</text>
  <text start="872.21" dur="6.28">almost every major news corporate media</text>
  <text start="875.28" dur="7.26">news outlet had it they were blaming the</text>
  <text start="878.49" dur="6.63">decline of the stock market on Trump now</text>
  <text start="882.54" dur="4.47">the reason why they have started to do</text>
  <text start="885.12" dur="3.78">this because they started to brainwash</text>
  <text start="887.01" dur="3.36">the public just like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="888.9" dur="3.69">brainwashing the public about Russian</text>
  <text start="890.37" dur="4.98">collusion and everything else because</text>
  <text start="892.59" dur="6.17">what I see happening right now as they</text>
  <text start="895.35" dur="6.78">have this new FBI this ex-fbi former FBI</text>
  <text start="898.76" dur="6.4">individual Mueller come in and run this</text>
  <text start="902.13" dur="4.65">special investigation into the Russian</text>
  <text start="905.16" dur="3.93">collusion they&amp;#39;re going to come out with</text>
  <text start="906.78" dur="3.72">tidbits every so often and the market is</text>
  <text start="909.09" dur="3.42">going to go down and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="910.5" dur="4.32">continually say oh the markets going</text>
  <text start="912.51" dur="4.14">down because of Trump he&amp;#39;s corrupt and</text>
  <text start="914.82" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re going to continually go on and</text>
  <text start="916.65" dur="4.38">on about this and why are they doing</text>
  <text start="918.15" dur="6.63">this because they are setting him up to</text>
  <text start="921.03" dur="5.34">take the fall for the entire economy</text>
  <text start="924.78" dur="3.69">coming down now we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="926.37" dur="4.89">this that there&amp;#39;s a battle going on</text>
  <text start="928.47" dur="5.1">between the central bank and the Trump</text>
  <text start="931.26" dur="6.69">administration on who brings the economy</text>
  <text start="933.57" dur="6.96">down and who owns the narrative here we</text>
  <text start="937.95" dur="4.89">are with the news organizations they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="940.53" dur="3.33">out there already blaming him for what</text>
  <text start="942.84" dur="2.58">has happened and of course this has</text>
  <text start="943.86" dur="4.59">something to do with him because we know</text>
  <text start="945.42" dur="4.08">the stock market is computer driven they</text>
  <text start="948.45" dur="2.88">can bring it up they can bring it down</text>
  <text start="949.5" dur="3.95">they could do whatever they want the</text>
  <text start="951.33" dur="4.41">central bank can crash it in a second</text>
  <text start="953.45" dur="4.84">but what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="955.74" dur="6.21">creating this narrative because they</text>
  <text start="958.29" dur="5.76">want to blame it all on him and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="961.95" dur="4.86">going to see going forward now as the</text>
  <text start="964.05" dur="5.28">chaos continues and as they keep pushing</text>
  <text start="966.81" dur="4.68">their agenda they are going to</text>
  <text start="969.33" dur="4.02">continually use this to blame him and</text>
  <text start="971.49" dur="3.96">this is why you need to be prepared and</text>
  <text start="973.35" dur="6.6">ready because no matter what happens the</text>
  <text start="975.45" dur="7.41">economy is coming down and when it comes</text>
