  <text start="404.08" dur="4.71">inflation wake up Federal Reserve such</text>
  <text start="406.81" dur="6.12">growth potential almost like never</text>
  <text start="408.79" dur="6.99">before he continued so Germany is paying</text>
  <text start="412.93" dur="5.19">zero interest and is actually being paid</text>
  <text start="415.78" dur="4.08">to borrow money while the US are far</text>

  <text start="439.09" dur="4.47">all the other countries they have very</text>
  <text start="441.669" dur="4.441">low interest rates some countries are in</text>
  <text start="443.56" dur="5.97">the negative territory the United States</text>
  <text start="446.11" dur="5.97">is not there we&amp;#39;re not even close to</text>
  <text start="449.53" dur="6.56">zero yet we&amp;#39;re getting there but not</text>
  <text start="452.08" dur="7.47">there yet and he&amp;#39;s saying if the Fed</text>
  <text start="456.09" dur="6.72">doesn&amp;#39;t do what he wants the economy</text>
  <text start="459.55" dur="8.179">will crash where is the Fed right now</text>
  <text start="462.81" dur="7.84">well they&amp;#39;re stuck there cornered</text>
  <text start="467.729" dur="4.841">because if they start raising the rates</text>
  <text start="470.65" dur="3.96">and they they do the opposite of what he</text>
  <text start="472.57" dur="4.68">says what happens to the economy it</text>
  <text start="474.61" dur="4.92">falls apart he&amp;#39;s got them if he keeps</text>

  <text start="488.639" dur="4.15">that&amp;#39;s it now</text>
  <text start="490.9" dur="4.38">the other benefit of all this as he</text>
  <text start="492.789" dur="5.25">continually lowers the rates and the</text>
  <text start="495.28" dur="5.43">United States is borrowing at 0% once it</text>

  <text start="642.88" dur="7.17">using before to make the economy look</text>
  <text start="646.18" dur="7.29">absolutely incredible this is why they</text>
  <text start="650.05" dur="6.18">started the push right now remember they</text>
  <text start="653.47" dur="5.85">were hoping to push the interest rates</text>
