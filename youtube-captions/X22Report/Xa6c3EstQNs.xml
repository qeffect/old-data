  <text start="796.26" dur="4.949">America doesn&amp;#39;t care of China hogs all</text>
  <text start="798.27" dur="4.84">Iraq&amp;#39;s oil and I was thinking about this</text>
  <text start="801.209" dur="6.181">and they have a couple reasons here</text>
  <text start="803.11" dur="6.719">but my main reason is if I was China and</text>
  <text start="807.39" dur="7.72">I wanted to get rid of because if you</text>
  <text start="809.829" dur="9.421">remember Iraq was taken over by the US</text>

  <text start="851.8" dur="4.409">buying this this is how I&amp;#39;m thinking of</text>

  <text start="1426.78" dur="5.63">they&amp;#39;re dangerous but the government</text>
  <text start="1428.46" dur="8.63">officials are allowed to have them again</text>
  <text start="1432.41" dur="7.24">let&amp;#39;s use your brain let&amp;#39;s use logic</text>
  <text start="1437.09" dur="7.15">it&amp;#39;s much easier for all the other</text>
  <text start="1439.65" dur="7.29">agencies the DHS the military IRS Social</text>
  <text start="1444.24" dur="6.53">Security all these agencies to have guns</text>
  <text start="1446.94" dur="7.41">and the American people to have none and</text>
  <text start="1450.77" dur="5.59">when we see a separation of separate</text>
  <text start="1454.35" dur="5.06">laws for them and separate laws for the</text>
  <text start="1456.36" dur="8.809">people we are heading down the path</text>
  <text start="1459.41" dur="7.899">where the only outcome is martial law</text>
  <text start="1465.169" dur="4.571">rioting</text>
  <text start="1467.309" dur="6.98">them completely taking away our rights</text>
  <text start="1469.74" dur="6.899">and this is basically how it ends up and</text>
  <text start="1474.289" dur="6.401">there was also a report saying that</text>
  <text start="1476.639" dur="7.74">deasia DHS wants equipment for what riot</text>
  <text start="1480.69" dur="6.859">control nine I have to ask you when was</text>
  <text start="1484.379" dur="8.54">the last time you saw terrorists rioting</text>
  <text start="1487.549" dur="9.521">what you know when terrorists usually</text>
  <text start="1492.919" dur="7.541">plant the bomb supposedly fly planes</text>
  <text start="1497.07" dur="7.949">into buildings supposedly drive buses</text>
  <text start="1500.46" dur="9">into buildings and then run off have you</text>
  <text start="1505.019" dur="8.01">ever seen a terrorist rioting so why</text>
  <text start="1509.46" dur="8.309">else would DHS be purchasing riot gear</text>
  <text start="1513.029" dur="8.211">or have these teams of people using</text>
  <text start="1517.769" dur="7.081">Americans for drills like they did in LA</text>
  <text start="1521.24" dur="7.569">like it did in that zombie video there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1524.85" dur="7.5">only one reason they&amp;#39;re here to control</text>
  <text start="1528.809" dur="7.161">the American people before during and</text>
  <text start="1532.35" dur="6.63">after the collapse during martial law</text>
  <text start="1535.97" dur="6.25">rounding up people putting them into</text>
  <text start="1538.98" dur="5.85">groups looking at the list to see who</text>
  <text start="1542.22" dur="6.029">they have to go after using their fusion</text>
  <text start="1544.83" dur="8.299">centers to spy on everyone that is the</text>
  <text start="1548.249" dur="8.221">only reason they are doing this now</text>
  <text start="1553.129" dur="6.821">let&amp;#39;s move forward now Snowden has come</text>
  <text start="1556.47" dur="6.39">out and said that the u.s. targets</text>
  <text start="1559.95" dur="4.919">Chinese computers for cyberattacks NSA</text>
  <text start="1562.86" dur="3.299">whistleblower Edward Snowden who leaked</text>

  <text start="1566.159" dur="3.181">programs claims that the American</text>

  <text start="1569.34" dur="7.279">computers in hong kong and mainland</text>
  <text start="1571.47" dur="9.11">china for years and you know basically</text>
  <text start="1576.619" dur="6.28">the u.s. you know kind of denies it and</text>
  <text start="1580.58" dur="5.949">they never said they were hacking into</text>
  <text start="1582.899" dur="5.28">anything but you know then we get other</text>
  <text start="1586.529" dur="5.161">reports and other things that are coming</text>
  <text start="1588.179" dur="6.69">out the NSA chief says us infrastructure</text>
  <text start="1591.69" dur="4.8">highly vulnerable to cyberattacks and he</text>
  <text start="1594.869" dur="4.26">goes on to say on a scale from 1 to 10</text>
  <text start="1596.49" dur="4.26">with 10 being the strongly defended our</text>
  <text start="1599.129" dur="1.951">critical infrastructure preparedness to</text>
  <text start="1600.75" dur="2.58">which</text>
  <text start="1601.08" dur="6.15">a destructive cyber attack is about a</text>
  <text start="1603.33" dur="6.39">three based on my experience now</text>
  <text start="1607.23" dur="5.28">remember what he said here based on his</text>
  <text start="1609.72" dur="5.16">experience and he goes on to say and</text>
  <text start="1612.51" dur="4.29">I&amp;#39;ll come back to that in a minute while</text>
  <text start="1614.88" dur="3.24">we feel confident that most foreign</text>
  <text start="1616.8" dur="3.33">leaders believe that a devastating</text>
  <text start="1618.12" dur="3.51">attack on the critical infrastructure</text>
  <text start="1620.13" dur="4.34">and population in the United States by</text>
  <text start="1621.63" dur="5.31">cyber means would elicit a prompt and</text>
  <text start="1624.47" dur="5.29">proportionate response it is possible</text>
  <text start="1626.94" dur="5.01">however that some regime or cyber actor</text>
  <text start="1629.76" dur="4.47">could misjudge the impact and the</text>
  <text start="1631.95" dur="4.59">certainty of our resolve basically</text>
  <text start="1634.23" dur="7.29">saying we&amp;#39;re going to hit you and hit</text>
  <text start="1636.54" dur="10.17">you really really really hard now when I</text>
  <text start="1641.52" dur="8.7">said remember the word experience the</text>
  <text start="1646.71" dur="6.18">secret war Oh infiltration sabotage</text>
  <text start="1650.22" dur="5.58">devastating cyber attacks and this is</text>
  <text start="1652.89" dur="6.03">this what I&amp;#39;m going to read to you comes</text>
  <text start="1655.8" dur="8.12">from let me just look up here from the</text>
  <text start="1658.92" dur="9.33">Global Research Center and basically</text>
  <text start="1663.92" dur="7.26">what they have been doing and this is</text>
  <text start="1668.25" dur="6.48">why he knows from his experience and</text>
  <text start="1671.18" dur="6.1">this goes on to say but there is a flip</text>
  <text start="1674.73" dur="6.03">side to this equation that is rarely</text>
  <text start="1677.28" dur="6.81">mentioned the military has for years</text>
  <text start="1680.76" dur="6.3">been developing offensive capabilities</text>
  <text start="1684.09" dur="6.78">giving it the power not just to defend</text>
  <text start="1687.06" dur="7.13">the US but to a sale its foes using</text>
  <text start="1690.87" dur="6.84">so-called cyber kinetic attacks</text>
  <text start="1694.19" dur="7.51">Alexander and that&amp;#39;s the the general of</text>
  <text start="1697.71" dur="6.27">the NSA the one who lied about spying on</text>
  <text start="1701.7" dur="6.15">the American people the one that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1703.98" dur="8.4">telling us that Snowden is giving us</text>
  <text start="1707.85" dur="6.39">false information basically he says</text>
  <text start="1712.38" dur="4.77">Alexander and his forces now have the</text>
  <text start="1714.24" dur="5.42">capability to physically destroy an</text>
  <text start="1717.15" dur="8.28">adversaries equipment and infrastructure</text>
  <text start="1719.66" dur="7.9">and potentially even to kill Alexander</text>
  <text start="1725.43" dur="4.14">who declined to be in to interview for</text>
  <text start="1727.56" dur="4.71">this article has concluded that such</text>
  <text start="1729.57" dur="5.53">cyber weapons is crucial to 21st century</text>
  <text start="1732.27" dur="7.93">warfare as nuclear arms we&amp;#39;re in the 20s</text>
  <text start="1735.1" dur="7.38">century and basically and he and his</text>
  <text start="1740.2" dur="4.26">cyber warriors have already launched</text>
  <text start="1742.48" dur="5.01">their first attack the cyber weapon that</text>
  <text start="1744.46" dur="4.589">came to be known as Stuxnet was created</text>
  <text start="1747.49" dur="4.11">and built by the NSA in partnership with</text>
  <text start="1749.049" dur="5.401">the CIA Anna Israel intelligence in the</text>
  <text start="1751.6" dur="4.949">mid-2000s the first known piece of</text>
  <text start="1754.45" dur="6.66">malware designed to destroy physical</text>
  <text start="1756.549" dur="7.801">equipment stuck Stuxnet was aimed at</text>
  <text start="1761.11" dur="6.299">Iran&amp;#39;s nuclear facility and net nez i</text>
  <text start="1764.35" dur="6.449">hope i pronounced that right by taking</text>
  <text start="1767.409" dur="6.75">control of an industrial control link</text>
  <text start="1770.799" dur="5.941">known as SCADA supervisory control and</text>
  <text start="1774.159" dur="4.441">data acquisition system the physic the</text>
  <text start="1776.74" dur="5.25">sophisticated worm was able to damage</text>
  <text start="1778.6" dur="5.61">about a thousand centrifuges used to</text>
  <text start="1781.99" dur="5.91">enrich nuclear material so basically</text>
  <text start="1784.21" dur="7.29">they have already done this that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1787.9" dur="5.07">he said from his experience they already</text>
  <text start="1791.5" dur="6.659">know how to do this and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1792.97" dur="9.15">using it to cyber attack other countries</text>
  <text start="1798.159" dur="6.781">and what they&amp;#39;re going to do as the main</text>
  <text start="1802.12" dur="6.75">false flag is they&amp;#39;re going to use it</text>
  <text start="1804.94" dur="8.13">here and on other countries to say it</text>
  <text start="1808.87" dur="7.08">was China it was Iran it was Syria do</text>
  <text start="1813.07" dur="5.67">you see how all the pieces are coming</text>
  <text start="1815.95" dur="6.709">together now how everything is starting</text>
  <text start="1818.74" dur="6.36">to make sense and even with other</text>
  <text start="1822.659" dur="4.781">government officials in other countries</text>
  <text start="1825.1" dur="4.89">saying that their biggest worry now is</text>
  <text start="1827.44" dur="5.3">cyber attacks they&amp;#39;re trying to put it</text>
  <text start="1829.99" dur="6.27">out there that something is coming and</text>
  <text start="1832.74" dur="7.66">it will be coming because this let me</text>
  <text start="1836.26" dur="9.029">tell you is the main event this is going</text>
  <text start="1840.4" dur="8.22">to bring everyone to their knees now</text>
  <text start="1845.289" dur="7.5">someone asked me you know why would they</text>
  <text start="1848.62" dur="10.1">do this you know why would this happen</text>
  <text start="1852.789" dur="12.451">because our system our economic system</text>
  <text start="1858.72" dur="9.55">cannot be sustained and cowards like to</text>
  <text start="1865.24" dur="3.8">blame other people they cannot be blamed</text>
  <text start="1868.27" dur="4.76">themselves</text>
  <text start="1869.04" dur="8.67">so they will when they&amp;#39;re when cowards</text>
  <text start="1873.03" dur="7.47">are put into a corner they always point</text>
  <text start="1877.71" dur="6.27">the finger at other people that they did</text>
  <text start="1880.5" dur="6.09">it they don&amp;#39;t care who gets hurt they</text>
  <text start="1883.98" dur="5.73">don&amp;#39;t care who dies they don&amp;#39;t care who</text>
  <text start="1886.59" dur="8.07">gets sick they don&amp;#39;t care who suffers as</text>
  <text start="1889.71" dur="9.44">long as they are not to blame so what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1894.66" dur="9.18">going to happen if they cannot get</text>
  <text start="1899.15" dur="7.42">everything in place with all the bills</text>
  <text start="1903.84" dur="6.33">and the laws and the guns and everything</text>
  <text start="1906.57" dur="7.41">away they want it to happen they will</text>
  <text start="1910.17" dur="6.96">use this main event because they will be</text>
  <text start="1913.98" dur="6.18">put into a corner and the coward&amp;#39;s way</text>
  <text start="1917.13" dur="4.83">out is to blame someone else and it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1920.16" dur="4.47">be a lot easier to blame all this on</text>
  <text start="1921.96" dur="5.72">someone else but to do this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1924.63" dur="6.3">going to have to hurt make people suffer</text>
  <text start="1927.68" dur="8.05">make them see and wake them out of their</text>

  <text start="1944.22" dur="7.41">during this power outage and we had to</text>
  <text start="1948.36" dur="7.25">declare martial law they did this to us</text>
  <text start="1951.63" dur="6.69">and this is what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="1955.61" dur="7.57">this is their only way out and it&amp;#39;s</text>
