  <text start="105.58" dur="4.86">what they want to do and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="107.679" dur="6.381">doing it now the International Monetary</text>
  <text start="110.44" dur="6.33">Fund they are now pushing the euro zone</text>
  <text start="114.06" dur="5.83">to let Greece skip paying the interest</text>
  <text start="116.77" dur="6.08">or principal on the belt loans until</text>
  <text start="119.89" dur="6.74">2040 now they&amp;#39;re not gonna get rid of it</text>
  <text start="122.85" dur="6.129">they&amp;#39;re not gonna say okay you know</text>
  <text start="126.63" dur="4.21">let&amp;#39;s just wipe out the debt they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="128.979" dur="4.561">gonna say you know what let&amp;#39;s give them</text>
  <text start="130.84" dur="4.44">some leeway so the entire country</text>
  <text start="133.54" dur="3.57">doesn&amp;#39;t collapse because it wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="135.28" dur="4.17">look good for us they don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="137.11" dur="3.72">the country central bankers don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="139.45" dur="5.28">about the people they don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="140.83" dur="5.75">the country they care about their profit</text>
  <text start="144.73" dur="6.39">they care about debt they care about</text>
  <text start="146.58" dur="8.29">enslaving the people that&amp;#39;s first thing</text>
  <text start="151.12" dur="4.74">on their agenda so what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="154.87" dur="3.03">is that the interest rate on the</text>
  <text start="155.86" dur="6.719">eurozone loans they would be fixed for</text>
  <text start="157.9" dur="6.6">30 to 40 years and they would you know</text>
  <text start="162.579" dur="3.571">most likely not pay the interest</text>
  <text start="164.5" dur="3.78">during this time that maybe some of the</text>
  <text start="166.15" dur="5.79">principal but the loans will always be</text>
  <text start="168.28" dur="7.13">there because they realize they need to</text>
  <text start="171.94" dur="5.43">do this at this point out in France</text>
  <text start="175.41" dur="7.41">protesters have been taking to the</text>
  <text start="177.37" dur="9.3">streets once again because the</text>
  <text start="182.82" dur="9.82">government is pushing their labor laws</text>
  <text start="186.67" dur="10.53">and the law extends working hours</text>
  <text start="192.64" dur="6.87">it cuts holidays and we can see right</text>
  <text start="197.2" dur="4.77">now they&amp;#39;re putting this into place</text>
  <text start="199.51" dur="5.49">because they&amp;#39;re worried about the entire</text>
  <text start="201.97" dur="4.47">system collapsing and they&amp;#39;re preparing</text>
  <text start="205" dur="3.54">for what is coming and the people are</text>
  <text start="206.44" dur="5.72">saying ok we&amp;#39;re completely against this</text>
  <text start="208.54" dur="6.84">law this is why the government in France</text>
  <text start="212.16" dur="6.91">use this section of the constitution to</text>
  <text start="215.38" dur="8.43">get this law passed without their</text>
  <text start="219.07" dur="6.12">Congress they completely bypassed it now</text>
  <text start="223.81" dur="4.38">here in the States</text>
  <text start="225.19" dur="10.079">what are we saying well we are seeing</text>
  <text start="228.19" dur="10.62">the economy the real economy accelerate</text>
  <text start="235.269" dur="4.951">into collapse now I know a lot of people</text>
  <text start="238.81" dur="3.48">think that we&amp;#39;re in this incredible</text>
  <text start="240.22" dur="4.049">recovery I know a lot of people saying</text>
  <text start="242.29" dur="4.43">well it&amp;#39;s never gonna collapse you&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="249.76" dur="6.21">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking it following it now</text>
  <text start="252.94" dur="4.889">a lot of people were saying the economy</text>
  <text start="255.97" dur="4.739">was going to collapse prior to 2008 they</text>
  <text start="257.829" dur="6.061">said it for a very long time but guess</text>
  <text start="260.709" dur="6.991">what happened it collapsed the same</text>
  <text start="263.89" dur="6.69">thing is going to happen right now just</text>
  <text start="267.7" dur="5.85">because we&amp;#39;re following it just because</text>
  <text start="270.58" dur="6.66">we&amp;#39;re tracking it just because it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="273.55" dur="7.23">a long time doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="277.24" dur="6.12">to happen because what we&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="280.78" dur="6.87">we&amp;#39;re following the central bank the US</text>
  <text start="283.36" dur="8.19">government all the manipulation to make</text>
  <text start="287.65" dur="7.949">us believe that we have been in a</text>
  <text start="291.55" dur="6.36">recovery now as soon as it collapses all</text>
  <text start="295.599" dur="4.471">those people who said oh sorry</text>

  <text start="309.49" dur="7.79">always happens when we look at the facts</text>
  <text start="314.02" dur="8.13">and we look at what&amp;#39;s going on right now</text>
  <text start="317.28" dur="9.6">the economy is sliding deeper and deeper</text>
  <text start="322.15" dur="7.77">into the abyss it&amp;#39;s not going to improve</text>
  <text start="326.88" dur="4.66">it&amp;#39;s not gonna get better just because</text>
  <text start="329.92" dur="4.11">you&amp;#39;re saying that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="331.54" dur="5.13">right now believe me I know a lot of</text>
  <text start="334.03" dur="4.17">people who put up the illusion in their</text>
  <text start="336.67" dur="3.57">households that everything was fine</text>
  <text start="338.2" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re driving fancy cars they have a</text>

  <text start="350.98" dur="4.83">bankrupt they have no money that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="353.8" dur="3.39">what&amp;#39;s going to happen here and if you</text>
  <text start="355.81" dur="4.74">really think about it and you go back to</text>
  <text start="357.19" dur="6.12">2008 where all those people were out</text>
  <text start="360.55" dur="5.87">there saying even the government the Fed</text>
  <text start="363.31" dur="6">saying that we weren&amp;#39;t gonna collapse</text>
  <text start="366.42" dur="6.07">we&amp;#39;re in the year of 2008 we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="369.31" dur="5.91">forecasting a recession everything is</text>
  <text start="372.49" dur="4.83">fine everything is contained we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="375.22" dur="3.99">do anything illegal with the subprime</text>
  <text start="377.32" dur="6.15">securities Goldman didn&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="379.21" dur="8.61">illegal everything is fantastic actually</text>
  <text start="383.47" dur="7.07">if you look back in time who lied who</text>
  <text start="387.82" dur="6.39">said everything was going to be fine</text>
  <text start="390.54" dur="7.54">loves the US government and the Fed all</text>
  <text start="394.21" dur="7.02">those people going back to 2005-2006 who</text>
  <text start="398.08" dur="5.4">said the system is going to implode yeah</text>
  <text start="401.23" dur="5.37">it might have taken a while but guess</text>
  <text start="403.48" dur="5.34">what happened they were right and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="406.6" dur="5.67">why we&amp;#39;ve been tracking this so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="408.82" dur="9.27">no mistake of what is really going on</text>
  <text start="412.27" dur="8.91">right now that we are in a collapse</text>
  <text start="418.09" dur="7.29">scenario so we can look back in time and</text>
  <text start="421.18" dur="7.34">say yes we followed this all along we</text>
  <text start="425.38" dur="3.14">have the evidence and</text>
  <text start="428.77" dur="5.579">if this happens once again we look back</text>
  <text start="431.56" dur="4.47">at the evidence and we say aha they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="434.349" dur="2.761">repeating the same patterns or the</text>
  <text start="436.03" dur="5.16">patterns are a little different</text>
  <text start="437.11" dur="6.959">but we see the same exact signs now</text>
  <text start="441.19" dur="5.25">housing balanced by 6.6 percent now</text>
  <text start="444.069" dur="4.56">remember last month housing starts</text>
  <text start="446.44" dur="4.92">plunged by eight point eight six percent</text>
  <text start="448.629" dur="5.461">and of course we&amp;#39;ve seen this before we</text>
  <text start="451.36" dur="5.399">seen this pattern where we get a bounce</text>
  <text start="454.09" dur="4.68">up everything looks great everyone&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="456.759" dur="5.011">there saying the economy is doing well</text>
  <text start="458.77" dur="5.25">housing is back on track well we saw it</text>
  <text start="461.77" dur="4.769">with manufacturing we saw it with the</text>
  <text start="464.02" dur="4.86">ball to try index and we will</text>
  <text start="466.539" dur="6.12">continually see these patterns because</text>
  <text start="468.88" dur="7.74">the manipulation is still there but when</text>
  <text start="472.659" dur="8.391">you look at the housing market we are in</text>
  <text start="476.62" dur="6.329">a downward trend period that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="481.05" dur="6.669">there&amp;#39;s no way out of this I looked</text>
  <text start="482.949" dur="6.96">around the country and housing market</text>
  <text start="487.719" dur="4.5">and I&amp;#39;m not talking about the 20 cities</text>
  <text start="489.909" dur="4.141">that they like to choose to show that</text>
  <text start="492.219" dur="4.081">the housing prices are going up because</text>
  <text start="494.05" dur="3.66">those are the markets where they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="496.3" dur="2.82">created these bubbles I&amp;#39;m looking</text>
  <text start="497.71" dur="2.94">outside of this area because if the</text>
  <text start="499.12" dur="3.87">housing market is fantastic like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="500.65" dur="5.37">saying then we should see this in all</text>
  <text start="502.99" dur="5.85">other places they&amp;#39;re telling us how fast</text>
  <text start="506.02" dur="5.13">housing prices are rising so it went out</text>
  <text start="508.84" dur="5.67">to outside the city of New York in</text>
  <text start="511.15" dur="9.8">upstate New York about 45 minutes away</text>
  <text start="514.51" dur="9.659">and I see housing in that area declining</text>
  <text start="520.95" dur="5.35">actually a person had their house up and</text>
  <text start="524.169" dur="4.081">it was like six hundred and fifty nine</text>
  <text start="526.3" dur="4.11">thousand they&amp;#39;re down to five hundred</text>
  <text start="528.25" dur="5.67">and fifty nine thousand on the market</text>
  <text start="530.41" dur="6.119">for nine months beautiful house I went</text>
  <text start="533.92" dur="6.09">to the South I went to the Midwest I</text>
  <text start="536.529" dur="6.511">went to the West and I&amp;#39;m seeing patterns</text>
  <text start="540.01" dur="6.62">of this all over the place and that</text>
  <text start="543.04" dur="8.37">tells me something that tells me this</text>
  <text start="546.63" dur="8.88">housing market is starting to fall we</text>
  <text start="551.41" dur="6.81">saw the same patterns prior to 2008 and</text>
  <text start="555.51" dur="4.87">guess what happened the housing market</text>
  <text start="558.22" dur="6.44">collapsed</text>
  <text start="560.38" dur="9.6">we see that industrial production well</text>
  <text start="564.66" dur="8.07">they revised it for March then use that</text>
  <text start="569.98" dur="5.88">information brought it into April and</text>
  <text start="572.73" dur="4.69">month-on-month they said hey look we</text>
  <text start="575.86" dur="2.85">were expecting a point three percent</text>
  <text start="577.42" dur="5.82">increase and we got a point seven</text>
  <text start="578.71" dur="6.63">percent increase now this is a big</text>
  <text start="583.24" dur="6.03">monthly jump last time we saw this was</text>
  <text start="585.34" dur="6.51">back in November 2014 and we can thank</text>
  <text start="589.27" dur="5.4">this nice little spike to the revised</text>
  <text start="591.85" dur="5.99">numbers and the utilities that they</text>
  <text start="594.67" dur="6.81">added into this they added electrical</text>
  <text start="597.84" dur="5.17">utilities natural gas utilities which</text>
  <text start="601.48" dur="7.62">brought it up by five point four percent</text>
  <text start="603.01" dur="8.31">but year-on-year we see that industrial</text>
  <text start="609.1" dur="5.49">production has declined by negative one</text>
  <text start="611.32" dur="6.03">point zero seven percent so ye are near</text>
  <text start="614.59" dur="3.33">it has declined this is the eighth month</text>
  <text start="617.35" dur="4.05">in a row</text>
  <text start="617.92" dur="7.11">industrial production has fallen and it</text>
  <text start="621.4" dur="6.21">never fell for this long in ninety six</text>
  <text start="625.03" dur="8.24">years without the US economy being in a</text>
  <text start="627.61" dur="9.27">recession that doesn&amp;#39;t sound good</text>
  <text start="633.27" dur="6.07">so this is the longest streak of losses</text>
  <text start="636.88" dur="12.38">without a recession since records began</text>
  <text start="639.34" dur="12.9">in 1920s in the 1920s now we are in a</text>
  <text start="649.26" dur="5.5">collapse scenario some people say we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="652.24" dur="6.47">already in a recession and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="654.76" dur="6.24">accelerating because in a real economy</text>
  <text start="658.71" dur="4.12">we know that stuff is bought and sold</text>
  <text start="661" dur="4.59">and shipped around the country by trucks</text>
  <text start="662.83" dur="7.23">railroads planes when more stuff is</text>
  <text start="665.59" dur="6.15">being bought and sold guess what it more</text>
  <text start="670.06" dur="4.7">stuff is being shipped around the</text>
  <text start="671.74" dur="6.78">country and everything is growing and</text>
  <text start="674.76" dur="6.94">when less stuff is being bought less</text>
  <text start="678.52" dur="6.59">stuff is shipped around the country so</text>
  <text start="681.7" dur="6.18">when we look at April the Cass</text>
  <text start="685.11" dur="4.78">transportation index was down four point</text>
  <text start="687.88" dur="5.43">nine percent on a year-over-year basis</text>
  <text start="689.89" dur="4.08">what does this mean well a lot less</text>
  <text start="693.31" dur="2.339">stuff</text>
  <text start="693.97" dur="4.109">bought and sold and shipped around the</text>
  <text start="695.649" dur="7.08">country in April compared to April of</text>
  <text start="698.079" dur="7.26">2015 so the cash shipping index declined</text>
  <text start="702.729" dur="7.2">on a year-over-year basis for the 14th</text>
  <text start="705.339" dur="6.33">consecutive month the real economy and</text>
  <text start="709.929" dur="3.541">I&amp;#39;m not talking about the stock market</text>
  <text start="711.669" dur="3.09">which is completely manipulated to make</text>
  <text start="713.47" dur="4.349">everyone believe the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="714.759" dur="6.3">well has been slowing down for more than</text>
  <text start="717.819" dur="5.16">a year actually we saw this before</text>
  <text start="721.059" dur="5.22">remember what I talked about patterns</text>
  <text start="722.979" dur="6.77">and tracking everything so we understand</text>
  <text start="726.279" dur="7.55">what is going on here well in 2007-2008</text>
  <text start="729.749" dur="7.24">we saw the same exact thing happen and</text>
  <text start="733.829" dur="7.18">the Federal Reserve and the experts they</text>
  <text start="736.989" dur="6.42">do shirred us that this is not something</text>
