  <text start="126.14" dur="5.73">financial news now going back in time</text>
  <text start="129.19" dur="5.56">Trump and Obama they had this argument</text>
  <text start="131.87" dur="5.19">about the magic wand and many people</text>
  <text start="134.75" dur="4.83">were speculating what this wand is I do</text>
  <text start="137.06" dur="4.38">believe the magic wand is the control of</text>
  <text start="139.58" dur="3.719">the economy the control of the stock</text>
  <text start="141.44" dur="4.46">market the control of the precious</text>

  <text start="145.9" dur="7.54">statistical information the control of</text>
  <text start="148.54" dur="8.529">the Fed and we know that Trump has been</text>
  <text start="153.44" dur="5.49">pushing all this information these</text>
  <text start="157.069" dur="3.661">statistical information the stock market</text>
  <text start="158.93" dur="5.099">and everything else to make the economy</text>
  <text start="160.73" dur="4.64">look absolutely fantastic why because he</text>
  <text start="164.029" dur="4.551">has the match</text>
  <text start="165.37" dur="6.01">what was the deep state trying to do</text>
  <text start="168.58" dur="4.05">they were trying to bring us into a</text>
  <text start="171.38" dur="3.87">recession</text>
  <text start="172.63" dur="4.87">they knew the economy was not strong</text>
  <text start="175.25" dur="2.76">they knew that it was built on an</text>
  <text start="177.5" dur="2.79">illusion</text>
  <text start="178.01" dur="5.22">they knew that statistical numbers were</text>
  <text start="180.29" dur="5.67">manipulated and they knew all they had</text>
  <text start="183.23" dur="6.74">to do was raise the interest rates and</text>
  <text start="185.96" dur="7.14">the economy would rip itself apart and</text>
  <text start="189.97" dur="6.16">they knew during the presidential</text>
  <text start="193.1" dur="5.55">elections 2020 all they&amp;#39;d have to do</text>
  <text start="196.13" dur="6.39">leading up to that point was to tell</text>
  <text start="198.65" dur="6.99">everyone how bad the economy is and how</text>
  <text start="202.52" dur="6.78">bad it&amp;#39;s doing and it&amp;#39;s not gonna get</text>
  <text start="205.64" dur="6.71">better then the economy would come down</text>
  <text start="209.3" dur="6.36">and all those people who were out there</text>
  <text start="212.35" dur="5.95">preaching how bad the economy was how we</text>
  <text start="215.66" dur="5.94">were approaching recession they would</text>
  <text start="218.3" dur="6.24">look fantastic Trump would be sitting</text>
  <text start="221.6" dur="4.17">there looking like a fool because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="224.54" dur="5.73">been telling everyone how great the</text>
  <text start="225.77" dur="6.36">economy was well it seems those</text>
  <text start="230.27" dur="5.45">individuals who are running for</text>
  <text start="232.13" dur="7.56">president they didn&amp;#39;t get the memo</text>
  <text start="235.72" dur="7.63">what is the memo the memo is the</text>
  <text start="239.69" dur="8.54">Patriots are in control Trump has the</text>
  <text start="243.35" dur="8.82">magic wand the recession will not hit</text>
  <text start="248.23" dur="8.65">but we can see already they are out</text>
  <text start="252.17" dur="8.16">there attacking the economy because this</text>
  <text start="256.88" dur="8.6">is part of their plan and they still</text>
  <text start="260.33" dur="8.25">believe that their plan is active and</text>
  <text start="265.48" dur="4.42">you should hear how they are attacking</text>
  <text start="268.58" dur="3.99">and we&amp;#39;re gonna be going into that in</text>
  <text start="269.9" dur="5.31">just a minute but first I want to go out</text>
  <text start="272.57" dur="6.57">to the UK and we know that the brexit</text>
  <text start="275.21" dur="7.04">talks the brexit breakaway well it looks</text>
  <text start="279.14" dur="7.26">like it&amp;#39;s really not going anywhere and</text>
  <text start="282.25" dur="9.19">we see that Teresa may jean-claude</text>
  <text start="286.4" dur="8.88">juncker they met they had dinner at the</text>
  <text start="291.44" dur="5.64">EU headquarters in Brussels and there</text>
  <text start="295.28" dur="4.59">was no breakthrough</text>
  <text start="297.08" dur="5.01">may try to persuade the EU to revise</text>
  <text start="299.87" dur="3.6">their draft agreement on Britain&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.09" dur="2.819">withdrawal because lawmakers and</text>
  <text start="303.47" dur="5.52">Parliament have refused to approve it</text>
  <text start="304.909" dur="8.13">the EU said no way we&amp;#39;re not reopening</text>
  <text start="308.99" dur="7.47">the 585 page legal text it is what it is</text>
  <text start="313.039" dur="3.81">if you agree or you don&amp;#39;t that&amp;#39;s up to</text>
  <text start="316.46" dur="3.51">you</text>
  <text start="316.849" dur="5.421">the central bankers they are not gonna</text>
  <text start="319.97" dur="6.09">budge on this deal</text>
  <text start="322.27" dur="6.97">because they realize they need certain</text>
  <text start="326.06" dur="7.47">things in place and they have to be in</text>
  <text start="329.24" dur="6.84">place because once the UK separates from</text>
  <text start="333.53" dur="4.859">the EU they need to make sure that no</text>
  <text start="336.08" dur="4.049">one realizes that they&amp;#39;re better off and</text>
  <text start="338.389" dur="5.49">this is why they&amp;#39;re not going to budge</text>
  <text start="340.129" dur="6.09">on their entire plan so we might see a</text>
  <text start="343.879" dur="5.04">No Deal option you now of course the No</text>
  <text start="346.219" dur="4.23">Deal option they are fear-mongering like</text>
  <text start="348.919" dur="3.96">there&amp;#39;s no tomorrow like the world is</text>
  <text start="350.449" dur="3.571">going to come to an end and the reason</text>
  <text start="352.879" dur="3.151">why they&amp;#39;re doing that is because they</text>
  <text start="354.02" dur="4.859">know if there is a No Deal</text>
  <text start="356.03" dur="4.8">the UK is gonna do just fine and</text>
  <text start="358.879" dur="4.561">everyone&amp;#39;s gonna be looking at that and</text>
  <text start="360.83" dur="4.139">everyone&amp;#39;s gonna say wait a minute why</text>
  <text start="363.44" dur="2.99">don&amp;#39;t we do the same thing when I say</text>
  <text start="364.969" dur="5.961">they I&amp;#39;m talking about other countries</text>
  <text start="366.43" dur="8.109">so right now nothing has been decided</text>
  <text start="370.93" dur="6.07">here in the US we still see the central</text>
  <text start="374.539" dur="5.341">bank economy it is still deteriorating</text>
  <text start="377" dur="4.949">but it is slowed remember Trump the</text>
  <text start="379.88" dur="4.14">Patriots they&amp;#39;re in control of the</text>
  <text start="381.949" dur="3.361">central bank the central bank has</text>
  <text start="384.02" dur="3.48">indicated that they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="385.31" dur="4.979">offload their balance sheet right now</text>
  <text start="387.5" dur="5.699">they&amp;#39;re gonna hold on that they&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="390.289" dur="6.03">holding pattern in interest rates we</text>
  <text start="393.199" dur="6.09">know that China has started up the money</text>
  <text start="396.319" dur="6.21">printing engines and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="399.289" dur="5.581">see things start to slow but the economy</text>
  <text start="402.529" dur="4.621">remember is still an illusion it was</text>
  <text start="404.87" dur="5.31">created by the central bankers and they</text>
  <text start="407.15" dur="4.769">understand that the economy is not real</text>
  <text start="410.18" dur="3.63">and this is why they were trying to</text>
  <text start="411.919" dur="5.55">bring it down in 2020 so we see durable</text>
  <text start="413.81" dur="7.109">goods right now well they didn&amp;#39;t do as</text>
  <text start="417.469" dur="5.641">well as everyone expected and every time</text>
  <text start="420.919" dur="4.831">I look at this data and every time I go</text>
  <text start="423.11" dur="4.32">back to Obama to now it&amp;#39;s pretty much</text>
  <text start="425.75" dur="3.96">exactly the same</text>
  <text start="427.43" dur="5.58">the statistics are manipulated</text>
  <text start="429.71" dur="6.63">and we can see a slow deterioration of</text>
  <text start="433.01" dur="5.85">the economy now if we look at the US</text>
  <text start="436.34" dur="4.38">housing market it&amp;#39;s the same thing</text>
  <text start="438.86" dur="4.38">remember the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="440.72" dur="4.2">created these bubbles and they brought</text>
  <text start="443.24" dur="4.47">the housing market up and this is</text>
  <text start="444.92" dur="4.47">psychological because when people think</text>
  <text start="447.71" dur="3.36">their houses are worth a lot more now</text>
  <text start="449.39" dur="4.65">this is only on paper unless they sell</text>
  <text start="451.07" dur="4.44">they feel good about themselves they go</text>
  <text start="454.04" dur="3.09">out and spend they might even take</text>
  <text start="455.51" dur="4.23">equity lines of credit on their houses</text>
  <text start="457.13" dur="6.09">and they did this on purpose</text>
  <text start="459.74" dur="6.48">now the houses they&amp;#39;re becoming out of</text>
  <text start="463.22" dur="5.1">reach for many Americans and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="466.22" dur="3.51">helping we&amp;#39;re seeing that the housing</text>
  <text start="468.32" dur="5.31">market is still deteriorating even</text>
  <text start="469.73" dur="6.84">though the interest rates are not being</text>
  <text start="473.63" dur="4.8">increased any more by the Fed we see</text>
  <text start="476.57" dur="5.45">that people still can&amp;#39;t afford these</text>
  <text start="478.43" dur="6.78">homes I mean think about this for a sec</text>
  <text start="482.02" dur="7.78">we have mortgage rates at four point</text>
  <text start="485.21" dur="7.77">five percent and people still can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="489.8" dur="5.04">afford these homes in the Midwest sales</text>
  <text start="492.98" dur="5.01">have fallen by two point five percent</text>
  <text start="494.84" dur="7.11">the South by one the West two point nine</text>
  <text start="497.99" dur="5.73">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is there the</text>
  <text start="501.95" dur="3.99">housing market is still deteriorating</text>
  <text start="503.72" dur="4.08">and we&amp;#39;ll have to see what happens when</text>
  <text start="505.94" dur="3.6">we move forward because right now the</text>
  <text start="507.8" dur="6">Fed is in a holding pattern and this is</text>
  <text start="509.54" dur="8.04">on purpose because Trump stopped them</text>
  <text start="513.8" dur="7.47">from raising the interest rates further</text>
  <text start="517.58" dur="5.73">I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if the Fed says</text>
  <text start="521.27" dur="4.92">you know something because the inflation</text>
  <text start="523.31" dur="4.71">is not there and this was not there we</text>
  <text start="526.19" dur="4.71">need to drop the interest rates just a</text>
  <text start="528.02" dur="4.5">little bit I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if</text>
  <text start="530.9" dur="4.14">that happens or Trump comes out and</text>
  <text start="532.52" dur="4.56">tells them to do this remember he does</text>
  <text start="535.04" dur="5.4">have the magic wand he does have control</text>
  <text start="537.08" dur="6.51">we see China right now they have</text>
  <text start="540.44" dur="5.25">proposed to buy an additional 30 billion</text>
  <text start="543.59" dur="4.47">of US agricultural products a year</text>
  <text start="545.69" dur="6.12">including soybeans corn and wheat as</text>
  <text start="548.06" dur="4.98">part of the trade pact and the offer</text>
  <text start="551.81" dur="2.88">would be included in one of the</text>
  <text start="553.04" dur="3.9">memorandums the purchase would be added</text>
  <text start="554.69" dur="5.31">to pre trade bore levels of goods for</text>
  <text start="556.94" dur="5.01">the period covered now mainstream</text>
  <text start="560" dur="3.27">media&amp;#39;s out there and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="561.95" dur="4.32">make it seem like the tray</text>
  <text start="563.27" dur="5.94">talks they&amp;#39;re not going well and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="566.27" dur="6.6">trouble in the trade talks and the</text>
  <text start="569.21" dur="5.55">tariffs are coming well right now it</text>
  <text start="572.87" dur="4.2">looks like they might be putting off the</text>
  <text start="574.76" dur="4.47">tariffs we mentioned this before it</text>
  <text start="577.07" dur="5.07">looks like they&amp;#39;re gonna extend it past</text>
  <text start="579.23" dur="6.42">March 1st both sides are discussing this</text>
  <text start="582.14" dur="6.98">right now the u.s. been pressing Beijing</text>
  <text start="585.65" dur="6.45">to commit to keeping the yuan stable and</text>
  <text start="589.12" dur="6.97">they didn&amp;#39;t want them to devalue the one</text>
  <text start="592.1" dur="6.56">and China kept on saying no we can do</text>
  <text start="596.09" dur="6.75">whatever we want and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="598.66" dur="9.79">China the PBOC they affirmed that they</text>
  <text start="602.84" dur="9.84">would keep the yuan basically stable so</text>
  <text start="608.45" dur="6.6">it looks like the negotiations are going</text>
  <text start="612.68" dur="4.86">well and it looks like the Trump</text>
  <text start="615.05" dur="4.77">administration Xi Jinping and his</text>
  <text start="617.54" dur="6.44">administration it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="619.82" dur="9.06">working out all the different trade</text>
  <text start="623.98" dur="8.32">disagreements and again once they have a</text>
  <text start="628.88" dur="5.88">final agreement this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="632.3" dur="5.19">problem for the deep state think about</text>
  <text start="634.76" dur="4.95">what they wanted they liked it when</text>
  <text start="637.49" dur="4.68">Trump announced tariffs because they</text>
  <text start="639.71" dur="4.98">were going to use this against him he</text>
  <text start="642.17" dur="5.1">had other plans he needed to even the</text>
  <text start="644.69" dur="3.84">playing field with China remember we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="647.27" dur="4.2">not going to be the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="648.53" dur="6.62">anymore we can&amp;#39;t keep the system the way</text>
  <text start="651.47" dur="7.02">the globalists had it it will not work</text>
  <text start="655.15" dur="6.04">they were hoping they&amp;#39;d be able to bring</text>
  <text start="658.49" dur="4.98">down the economy with the Fed raising</text>
  <text start="661.19" dur="7.4">the interest rates well Trump put the</text>
  <text start="663.47" dur="8.16">kibosh on that the Fed was unwinding</text>
  <text start="668.59" dur="6.13">guess what it looks like they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="671.63" dur="5.16">going to do that anymore so the</text>
  <text start="674.72" dur="5.04">Democrats that are running in 2020 I</text>
  <text start="676.79" dur="4.86">think you didn&amp;#39;t mention that there was</text>
  <text start="679.76" dur="3.9">going to be many many running because</text>
  <text start="681.65" dur="5.54">they they would they believed that they</text>
  <text start="683.66" dur="6.5">would be safe if they ran for president</text>
  <text start="687.19" dur="6.31">but we know that nobody is safe and</text>
  <text start="690.16" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re out there and the first thing</text>
  <text start="693.5" dur="5.36">that they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re attacking</text>
  <text start="695.68" dur="5.25">the economy now why would they be doing</text>

  <text start="700.93" dur="3.99">mandate remember the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="702.91" dur="5.82">came out and through all the different</text>
  <text start="704.92" dur="5.55">mainstream media outlets they said that</text>
  <text start="708.73" dur="3.419">the economy is going to be entering a</text>
  <text start="710.47" dur="3.779">recession in 2020 it&amp;#39;s gonna slow in</text>
  <text start="712.149" dur="4.74">2019 we&amp;#39;re gonna enter a recession in</text>
  <text start="714.249" dur="7.231">2020 and they&amp;#39;re all just following</text>
  <text start="716.889" dur="7.651">along we see they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="721.48" dur="7.169">rapid growth and low unemployment under</text>
  <text start="724.54" dur="7.349">Trump isn&amp;#39;t enough why is it enough</text>
  <text start="728.649" dur="8.13">because America needs to strive for a</text>
  <text start="731.889" dur="9.48">moral economy mean an honest economy so</text>
  <text start="736.779" dur="8.24">they realize that Trump has the magic</text>
  <text start="741.369" dur="6.931">wand and he&amp;#39;s able to do everything</text>
  <text start="745.019" dur="5.56">Obama was able to do and the president</text>
  <text start="748.3" dur="5.759">before him and president before him was</text>
  <text start="750.579" dur="6.51">able to do and now they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="754.059" dur="6.541">push the narrative that we need a moral</text>
  <text start="757.089" dur="5.55">economy we see Kamala Harris out there</text>
  <text start="760.6" dur="5.729">and she&amp;#39;s saying that Trump&amp;#39;s economy</text>
  <text start="762.639" dur="7.2">for valuing job quantity over quality is</text>
  <text start="766.329" dur="7.2">not a good thing so wait a minute if we</text>
  <text start="769.839" dur="8.34">go back in time to Obama weren&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="773.529" dur="6.78">saying the same thing that quantity and</text>
  <text start="778.179" dur="4.441">quality it&amp;#39;s just not there because</text>
  <text start="780.309" dur="5.161">every time the unemployment statistics</text>
  <text start="782.62" dur="4.139">came out we said well yeah look what</text>
  <text start="785.47" dur="5.159">they did they manipulated the numbers</text>
  <text start="786.759" dur="6">one two three part-time jobs is being</text>
  <text start="790.629" dur="5.101">counted as one two three full-time jobs</text>
  <text start="792.759" dur="6.45">so yes there&amp;#39;s quantity but there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="795.73" dur="7.409">quality so you can see they&amp;#39;re gonna try</text>
  <text start="799.209" dur="5.63">to start to use everything that they</text>
  <text start="803.139" dur="5.04">were doing in the past</text>
  <text start="804.839" dur="5.86">remember Trump he&amp;#39;s using all their</text>
  <text start="808.179" dur="5.01">weapons against them and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="810.699" dur="5.37">to knock at Trump because they</text>
  <text start="813.189" dur="6.661">understand and they know what was going</text>
  <text start="816.069" dur="7.14">on before they know that most of the</text>
  <text start="819.85" dur="5.399">jobs are part-time they know that this</text>
  <text start="823.209" dur="3.42">was not an honest economy and this has</text>
  <text start="825.249" dur="2.851">nothing to do with Trump this was way</text>
  <text start="826.629" dur="2.701">before and this is why we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="828.1" dur="4.44">watching all of this</text>
  <text start="829.33" dur="6.33">tracking it so right now they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="832.54" dur="6.979">to attack the economy any way they</text>
  <text start="835.66" dur="7.44">possibly can but they can&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="839.519" dur="4.57">because Trump the Patriots they have</text>
  <text start="843.1" dur="3.51">countermeasures</text>
  <text start="844.089" dur="4.471">they&amp;#39;re prepared and ready for them</text>
  <text start="846.61" dur="4.5">remember what Trump has been doing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="848.56" dur="4.98">been bringing back manufacturing jobs</text>
  <text start="851.11" dur="5.43">remember they just can&amp;#39;t come out and</text>
  <text start="853.54" dur="5.82">say hey listen you&amp;#39;re manipulating the</text>
  <text start="856.54" dur="3.6">stator hey listen this information is</text>
  <text start="859.36" dur="3.9">all fake</text>
  <text start="860.14" dur="5.73">if they do this he can turn around and</text>
  <text start="863.26" dur="6.9">say listen I&amp;#39;m using everything Obama</text>
  <text start="865.87" dur="8.909">used the same calculations the same</text>
  <text start="870.16" dur="7.89">magic wand the same statistics you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="874.779" dur="6.06">telling me this is wrong and if they do</text>
  <text start="878.05" dur="4.92">this they&amp;#39;re screwed so they have to</text>
  <text start="880.839" dur="3.75">attack it in different ways and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="882.97" dur="7.01">hard to believe that they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="884.589" dur="10.291">going after the economy thinking that</text>
  <text start="889.98" dur="7.359">everything set to go down in 2020 what</text>
  <text start="894.88" dur="5.09">happens when the economy doesn&amp;#39;t go down</text>

  <text start="930.49" dur="6.94">the Patriots there&amp;#39;s nothing they can do</text>
  <text start="934.149" dur="6.041">how will Trump counter all of this</text>
  <text start="937.43" dur="5.79">he&amp;#39;ll just take the economy to the</text>
  <text start="940.19" dur="6.72">extreme you&amp;#39;ll see the market go way way</text>
  <text start="943.22" dur="7.62">up you&amp;#39;ll see the job numbers go way way</text>
  <text start="946.91" dur="7.08">down you&amp;#39;ll hear that more manufacturing</text>
