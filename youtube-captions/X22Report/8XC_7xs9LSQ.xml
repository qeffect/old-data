  <text start="251.879" dur="5.82">assets and surrounding Russia containing</text>
  <text start="255.54" dur="4.379">them just like they&amp;#39;ve done and the</text>
  <text start="257.699" dur="4.59">Pacific where they&amp;#39;re encircling China</text>
  <text start="259.919" dur="3.87">and they&amp;#39;re containing china just like</text>

  <text start="272.099" dur="5.07">see the UK has brought in warships which</text>
  <text start="274.56" dur="5.669">are patrolling and they are in the Black</text>
  <text start="277.169" dur="5.391">Sea they&amp;#39;re moving troops in around six</text>
  <text start="280.229" dur="5.581">thousand or so to the Baltic countries</text>
  <text start="282.56" dur="4.99">NATO right now is welcoming the</text>
  <text start="285.81" dur="4.46">announcement of us plans to</text>
  <text start="287.55" dur="6.6">significantly increase presence in</text>
  <text start="290.27" dur="7.85">Europe with what more troops heavy</text>
  <text start="294.15" dur="8.26">equipment and it&amp;#39;s all being</text>
  <text start="298.12" dur="6.81">brought in now the question is why why</text>
  <text start="302.41" dur="5.13">do they need all this what are they so</text>
  <text start="304.93" dur="4.68">worried about well they&amp;#39;re not worried</text>
  <text start="307.54" dur="7.14">about anything they&amp;#39;re getting prepare</text>
  <text start="309.61" dur="10.65">for war that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re doing at</text>
  <text start="314.68" dur="8.91">this point and we realize that turkey</text>
  <text start="320.26" dur="6.96">released all these refugees and they let</text>
  <text start="323.59" dur="5.579">them go throughout Europe and all the</text>
  <text start="327.22" dur="3.93">European countries are saying this is</text>
  <text start="329.169" dur="4.441">ridiculous as too many we can&amp;#39;t handle</text>
  <text start="331.15" dur="5.13">it and we know they have the Schengen</text>
  <text start="333.61" dur="5.839">where they can go anywhere without a</text>
  <text start="336.28" dur="6.99">passport the borders are open and</text>
  <text start="339.449" dur="6.161">normally during war or prior to war</text>
  <text start="343.27" dur="7.5">countries start to close down their</text>
  <text start="345.61" dur="10.679">borders and we know the refugees were</text>
  <text start="350.77" dur="9.06">being used to get Europe involved in</text>
  <text start="356.289" dur="6.06">Syria and when I say involved I mean</text>
  <text start="359.83" dur="6.57">more money more troops more military</text>
  <text start="362.349" dur="8.311">assets and get them very angry in what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="366.4" dur="7.949">going on in Syria and right now it looks</text>
  <text start="370.66" dur="7.1">like the European nations from a</text>
  <text start="374.349" dur="8.011">document that was released it says that</text>
  <text start="377.76" dur="7.659">they might at this point we strict</text>
  <text start="382.36" dur="5.73">passport free travel by invoking an</text>
  <text start="385.419" dur="5.671">emergency rule for two years due to the</text>
  <text start="388.09" dur="5.389">migration crisis so we know that Israel</text>
  <text start="391.09" dur="5.759">is building a fence around their country</text>
  <text start="393.479" dur="5.081">other countries now are going to throw</text>
  <text start="396.849" dur="2.971">away the Schengen they&amp;#39;re going to close</text>
  <text start="398.56" dur="4.859">their borders they&amp;#39;re going to erect</text>
  <text start="399.82" dur="9.42">fences all around set up the borders</text>
  <text start="403.419" dur="8.37">once again and we know that turkey along</text>
  <text start="409.24" dur="7.049">with jay johnson was helping turkey do</text>
  <text start="411.789" dur="9.451">this along their border so what does</text>
  <text start="416.289" dur="12.091">this all mean it means they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="421.24" dur="9.299">prepared for something very big and we</text>
  <text start="428.38" dur="3.27">all need to be worried about what is</text>
  <text start="430.539" dur="3.63">coming here</text>
  <text start="431.65" dur="5.7">because all these indicators that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="434.169" dur="7.441">been looking at is pointing in this</text>
  <text start="437.35" dur="7.17">direction we see NATO has ships out in</text>
  <text start="441.61" dur="4.26">the Mediterranean of course they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="444.52" dur="5.1">there saying that you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="445.87" dur="6.9">trying to help with pirating with the</text>
  <text start="449.62" dur="5.73">refugees scenario but we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="452.77" dur="6.33">bringing in more ships to the area to</text>
  <text start="455.35" dur="8.099">patrol the area&amp;#39;s to control the areas</text>
  <text start="459.1" dur="7.069">and now in Iraq we see that the Iraqi</text>
  <text start="463.449" dur="6">army has been taking back ramadi and</text>
  <text start="466.169" dur="5.47">they&amp;#39;re finding the Islamic state trying</text>
  <text start="469.449" dur="4.741">to sneak out of the country a lot of</text>
  <text start="471.639" dur="5.671">them are dressed as women as they try to</text>
  <text start="474.19" dur="8.09">flee from the Iraqi forces and the whole</text>
  <text start="477.31" dur="9.289">thing is completely falling apart and</text>
  <text start="482.28" dur="7.62">what we realize at this point is that</text>
  <text start="486.599" dur="8.051">NATO said something very interesting</text>
  <text start="489.9" dur="7.36">today they said NATO has decided to</text>
  <text start="494.65" dur="7.44">provide assistance in the refugee crisis</text>
  <text start="497.26" dur="7.62">because it affects all of us and we have</text>
  <text start="502.09" dur="5.009">to contribute to suck to solve it this</text>
  <text start="504.88" dur="6.06">is coming from Secretary General Jens</text>
  <text start="507.099" dur="6.271">Stoltenberg adding that the Russian</text>
  <text start="510.94" dur="7.26">raids has significantly contributed to</text>
  <text start="513.37" dur="7.159">the worsening refugee crisis and he went</text>
  <text start="518.2" dur="4.969">on to say that NATO warships in the</text>
  <text start="520.529" dur="6.241">Mediterranean and the Black Sea are</text>
  <text start="523.169" dur="7.331">ready to defend the Turkish territory in</text>
  <text start="526.77" dur="6.18">the event of a new development that</text>
  <text start="530.5" dur="9.06">would threaten turkey safety and</text>
  <text start="532.95" dur="9.759">security what new development so the</text>
  <text start="539.56" dur="6.54">ships are there for what then they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="542.709" dur="6.691">there for war for this new development</text>
  <text start="546.1" dur="7.35">they&amp;#39;re letting you know already what is</text>
  <text start="549.4" dur="6.78">about to happen right now uS Defense</text>
  <text start="553.45" dur="7.25">Secretary Ashton Carter says NATO</text>
  <text start="556.18" dur="7.34">military lines may join a coalition that</text>
  <text start="560.7" dur="4.679">will target of course the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="563.52" dur="5.7">no</text>
  <text start="565.379" dur="9.031">they&amp;#39;re building up their coalition with</text>
  <text start="569.22" dur="7.799">war and to go after Russia because this</text>
  <text start="574.41" dur="4.409">is what it&amp;#39;s about right now they know</text>
  <text start="577.019" dur="4.68">they can&amp;#39;t get Assad out of the country</text>
  <text start="578.819" dur="5.91">they know that Russia will not let this</text>
  <text start="581.699" dur="5.91">happen they know that the people in</text>
  <text start="584.729" dur="7.04">Syria they&amp;#39;re going to vote for Assad</text>
  <text start="587.609" dur="8.42">just like they did back in July of 2014</text>
  <text start="591.769" dur="8.65">so the plan has changed the plan is</text>
  <text start="596.029" dur="6.37">let&amp;#39;s go start the war with Russia this</text>
  <text start="600.419" dur="5.01">is why we&amp;#39;re seeing the build-up of the</text>
  <text start="602.399" dur="4.65">ships this is why the UK has ships there</text>
  <text start="605.429" dur="3.8">this is why the US has brought</text>
  <text start="607.049" dur="4.53">amphibious ships to the Mediterranean</text>
  <text start="609.229" dur="4.39">this is why they&amp;#39;re having drills right</text>
  <text start="611.579" dur="7.35">now in Jordan they&amp;#39;re bringing in the</text>
  <text start="613.619" dur="7.8">military assets troops into Jordan this</text>
  <text start="618.929" dur="6.06">is why Saudi Arabia keeps saying yes we</text>
  <text start="621.419" dur="8.25">will supply the armed forces to fight in</text>
  <text start="624.989" dur="7.59">Syria they&amp;#39;re planning something and</text>
  <text start="629.669" dur="6.33">they&amp;#39;re planning something big now we</text>
  <text start="632.579" dur="6.26">see that the US and Russia they got</text>
  <text start="635.999" dur="7.471">together and they created this ceasefire</text>
  <text start="638.839" dur="7.72">peace plan it&amp;#39;s an ambitious plan to end</text>
  <text start="643.47" dur="5.969">all the hostilities and they might push</text>
  <text start="646.559" dur="5.85">this within the next week and revive the</text>
  <text start="649.439" dur="5.88">Geneva 3 peace talks they want to begin</text>
  <text start="652.409" dur="6.21">delivering humanitarian aid to civilians</text>
  <text start="655.319" dur="5.07">and help out those people who are</text>
  <text start="658.619" dur="6.93">suffering which is something they need</text>
  <text start="660.389" dur="9.211">to do the main objective is to destroy</text>
  <text start="665.549" dur="6.09">the Islamic state and Lavrov is out</text>
  <text start="669.6" dur="4.289">there saying listen I know we have a</text>
  <text start="671.639" dur="4.92">ceasefire but this doesn&amp;#39;t stop us from</text>
  <text start="673.889" dur="5.04">hitting terrorists the problem I have</text>
  <text start="676.559" dur="4.291">with all this is that they never came up</text>
  <text start="678.929" dur="4.86">with a list of who the terrorists is and</text>
  <text start="680.85" dur="4.979">who the opposition is so the US could</text>
  <text start="683.789" dur="4.11">come out and say listen you&amp;#39;re hitting</text>
  <text start="685.829" dur="3.24">the opposition the Russia could say no</text>
  <text start="687.899" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;re not we&amp;#39;re hitting the terrace</text>
  <text start="689.069" dur="5.07">because it&amp;#39;s unclear at this time and</text>
  <text start="691.859" dur="5.06">the US could come back and say listen</text>
  <text start="694.139" dur="4.981">they broke the ceasefire deal once again</text>
  <text start="696.919" dur="3.821">which they never did in the first</text>
  <text start="699.12" dur="4.86">but these are the words they will use</text>
  <text start="700.74" dur="6.24">the UN official is out there and he is</text>
  <text start="703.98" dur="7.53">casting doubt on the outlook for the</text>
  <text start="706.98" dur="7.29">Syria peace talks because the United</text>
  <text start="711.51" dur="6.03">States does not want peace the Islamic</text>
  <text start="714.27" dur="6.18">state is the proxy army for the United</text>

  <text start="720.45" dur="5.43">there saying listen a deal to end</text>
  <text start="723.42" dur="5.54">fighting in Syria requires a change in</text>
  <text start="725.88" dur="6.66">behavior from the government of Assad</text>
  <text start="728.96" dur="8.08">really so we have a leader that was</text>

  <text start="796.589" dur="10.021">dead set against this and we see why the</text>
  <text start="804.63" dur="5.399">United States needs some time here</text>
  <text start="806.61" dur="7.83">because Russia destroyed the oil convoy</text>
  <text start="810.029" dur="7.981">and they have also destroyed the CIA&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="847.679" dur="6.27">can&amp;#39;t have this closed now Russia has</text>
  <text start="852.36" dur="5.37">closed off many of the pathways for the</text>
  <text start="853.949" dur="6.81">CIA and they&amp;#39;ve been stopping all of</text>
  <text start="857.73" dur="5.43">this around the area and of course the</text>
  <text start="860.759" dur="4.351">US doesn&amp;#39;t like this this is hurting</text>
  <text start="863.16" dur="6.089">their proxy army their opposition forces</text>
  <text start="865.11" dur="5.279">and we see this is a huge problem for</text>

  <text start="870.389" dur="4.92">ceasefire would stop all this and of</text>
  <text start="874.139" dur="2.94">course they&amp;#39;re allowed to bring in</text>
  <text start="875.309" dur="4.5">humanitarian aid what do you think</text>
  <text start="877.079" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re really bringing in it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="879.809" dur="4.14">going to be humanitarian aid to</text>
  <text start="880.889" dur="5.7">civilians it&amp;#39;s going to be a drop for</text>
  <text start="883.949" dur="6.57">the terrorist groups the opposition</text>
  <text start="886.589" dur="6.631">which is all one of the same now turkey</text>
  <text start="890.519" dur="5.55">is making the case of why they had to</text>
  <text start="893.22" dur="6.32">close their border because there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="896.069" dur="6.87">hundred thousand Syrian refugees that</text>
  <text start="899.54" dur="6.549">are camping outside of their border on</text>
  <text start="902.939" dur="4.921">the Syrian side they&amp;#39;re very close to</text>
  <text start="906.089" dur="5.25">the Turkish border and we just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="907.86" dur="5.88">take on more refugees they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="911.339" dur="4.321">there are nine camps on the other side</text>
  <text start="913.74" dur="5.579">of the border and there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="915.66" dur="6">people there and would be nice since we</text>
  <text start="919.319" dur="6.48">already have the camps there to make</text>
  <text start="921.66" dur="6.029">this a safe zone where we can bring in</text>
  <text start="925.799" dur="5.01">military to protect these people because</text>
  <text start="927.689" dur="7.65">we have no more room in Turkey see what</text>
  <text start="930.809" dur="7.38">they&amp;#39;re trying to do at this point well</text>
  <text start="935.339" dur="6.511">it looks like the u.s. is moving on to</text>
  <text start="938.189" dur="7.161">the next phase of the plan Kerry in an</text>
  <text start="941.85" dur="6.179">interview delivered in unmistakable</text>
  <text start="945.35" dur="5.949">threat in connection with the u.s.</text>
  <text start="948.029" dur="6.451">negotiating strategy in Munich he said</text>
  <text start="951.299" dur="6.54">what we&amp;#39;re doing is testing Russian</text>
  <text start="954.48" dur="6.51">seriousness and if they&amp;#39;re not serious</text>
  <text start="957.839" dur="6.37">then there has to be consideration of a</text>
  <text start="960.99" dur="10.899">plan B you just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="964.209" dur="9.72">sit there plan B what is plan B well</text>
  <text start="971.889" dur="5.93">this would consist of a sharp escalation</text>
  <text start="973.929" dur="8.16">of the US military intervention in Syria</text>
  <text start="977.819" dur="7.24">carried out under the cover of combating</text>
  <text start="982.089" dur="5.37">the Islamic state but directed at</text>
  <text start="985.059" dur="3.63">toppling the Assad government nothing&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="987.459" dur="5.82">changed this is what they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="988.689" dur="6.481">all along Saudi Arabia and Qatar have</text>
  <text start="993.279" dur="4.201">also reportedly spent the last several</text>
  <text start="995.17" dur="4.32">days discussing a plan B that would</text>
  <text start="997.48" dur="4.26">involve their participation in direct</text>
  <text start="999.49" dur="8.25">military intervention to save the rebels</text>
  <text start="1001.74" dur="9.659">that they have supported so we see that</text>
  <text start="1007.74" dur="6">Saudi Arabia has confirmed that the</text>
  <text start="1011.399" dur="6">House of Saud is going to send troops</text>
  <text start="1013.74" dur="8.25">into Syria of course this is an invasion</text>
  <text start="1017.399" dur="7.861">and right now in the United States there</text>
  <text start="1021.99" dur="4.62">is no support for any type of US</text>
  <text start="1025.26" dur="4.769">military intervention so they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1026.61" dur="6.089">to use other countries to do this so the</text>
  <text start="1030.029" dur="6.361">next phase is going to be the role of</text>
  <text start="1032.699" dur="6.48">Turkey and Saudi Arabia the Turkish</text>
  <text start="1036.39" dur="4.98">forces are now directly involved in</text>
  <text start="1039.179" dur="4.441">combat operations within Syrian</text>
  <text start="1041.37" dur="4.11">territory we we saw this on a video from</text>
  <text start="1043.62" dur="7.529">Russia where they showed turkey is</text>
  <text start="1045.48" dur="7.86">shelling the Syrian area in turn Saudi</text>
  <text start="1051.149" dur="4.26">Arabia which is a state sponsor of</text>
  <text start="1053.34" dur="8.79">terrorism has announced that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1055.409" dur="10.831">going to send troops in as we know Saudi</text>
  <text start="1062.13" dur="7.529">Arabia has said we will fight with the</text>
  <text start="1066.24" dur="9.169">us-led coalition allies to defeat the</text>
  <text start="1069.659" dur="12.711">Islamic state militants in Syria and</text>
  <text start="1075.409" dur="11.64">what does this really mean the proxy war</text>
  <text start="1082.37" dur="7.96">against the Islamic state is over</text>
  <text start="1087.049" dur="7.6">they&amp;#39;re removing the Islamic state from</text>
  <text start="1090.33" dur="7.2">the area a new proxy war with Turkey and</text>
  <text start="1094.649" dur="6.751">Saudi Arabia with</text>
  <text start="1097.53" dur="6.63">a ground operation is now unfolding with</text>
  <text start="1101.4" dur="9.06">us NATO pulling the strings in the</text>
  <text start="1104.16" dur="10.86">background so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="1110.46" dur="8.43">now is while they&amp;#39;re talking peace and</text>
  <text start="1115.02" dur="6.36">ceasefire the united states with the</text>
  <text start="1118.89" dur="6.6">coalition forces they have moved on to</text>
  <text start="1121.38" dur="7.7">the next phase of the plan they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1125.49" dur="7.83">to do a full-out ground invasion and</text>
  <text start="1129.08" dur="5.95">under this evolving scenario there is</text>
  <text start="1133.32" dur="4.88">also danger that Turkey and Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="1135.03" dur="5.54">forces acting on behalf of us and nato</text>
  <text start="1138.2" dur="5.44">could be involved in military</text>
  <text start="1140.57" dur="8.95">confrontations with both Russia and Iran</text>
  <text start="1143.64" dur="10.67">and what does this mean while this opens</text>
  <text start="1149.52" dur="8.37">the door towards a military escalation</text>
  <text start="1154.31" dur="7.87">because at this point when we look at</text>
  <text start="1157.89" dur="6.84">what&amp;#39;s going on here we see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1162.18" dur="4.92">giving up the possibility and the idea</text>
  <text start="1164.73" dur="6.75">of removing Assad they know this is not</text>
  <text start="1167.1" dur="6.57">possible they know they&amp;#39;re backed into a</text>
  <text start="1171.48" dur="6.6">corner the economy is crashing as we can</text>
  <text start="1173.67" dur="6.78">see they have no way of getting Assad</text>
  <text start="1178.08" dur="5.37">out of power and basically changing out</text>
  <text start="1180.45" dur="5.88">the government in Syria which means they</text>
  <text start="1183.45" dur="7.2">can&amp;#39;t get into Iran which means they</text>
  <text start="1186.33" dur="6.45">can&amp;#39;t prop up the dollar it&amp;#39;s falling</text>
  <text start="1190.65" dur="4.08">apart they don&amp;#39;t have the resources to</text>
  <text start="1192.78" dur="4.44">go back into the other countries they</text>
  <text start="1194.73" dur="4.86">have the authorization for war to go</text>
  <text start="1197.22" dur="7.23">back into the other countries so now</text>
  <text start="1199.59" dur="6.75">their new plan is all-out war this is</text>
  <text start="1204.45" dur="4.68">what they&amp;#39;re doing at this point and</text>
  <text start="1206.34" dur="5.61">this should make every single person</text>
  <text start="1209.13" dur="5.1">very very nervous this is why the draft</text>
  <text start="1211.95" dur="3.78">bill is floating around Congress this is</text>
  <text start="1214.23" dur="4.86">why they&amp;#39;re mentioning about drafting</text>
  <text start="1215.73" dur="5.93">women this is why you see the all the US</text>
  <text start="1219.09" dur="6.84">Armed Armed Forces commercials</text>
  <text start="1221.66" dur="7.87">continually rolling and running they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1225.93" dur="4.89">getting everyone prepared and ready this</text>
  <text start="1229.53" dur="4.29">is why we see the</text>
  <text start="1230.82" dur="6.54">the military assets the ship&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1233.82" dur="7.14">troops the training the drills all in</text>
  <text start="1237.36" dur="7.47">these areas they are getting prepared</text>
  <text start="1240.96" dur="12.89">and ready but the problem is turkey</text>
  <text start="1244.83" dur="11.969">Saudi Arabia Qatar UK US France Italy</text>
  <text start="1253.85" dur="6.189">just can&amp;#39;t waltz into Syria and say</text>
  <text start="1256.799" dur="9.33">we&amp;#39;ve got a ground invasion now they</text>
  <text start="1260.039" dur="12.24">need a way to explain why they need to</text>
  <text start="1266.129" dur="8.191">go into Syria why they need to go in</text>
  <text start="1272.279" dur="8.811">there why they need the ground forces</text>
  <text start="1274.32" dur="6.77">and we&amp;#39;re starting to hear all these</text>
  <text start="1281.12" dur="11.169">fear-mongering ideas from our government</text>
  <text start="1287.21" dur="7.27">that the Islamic state they&amp;#39;ve used</text>
  <text start="1292.289" dur="4.74">chemical weapons which we know they have</text>
  <text start="1294.48" dur="4.949">the capability to create chemical</text>
  <text start="1297.029" dur="4.591">weapons such as chlorine and mustard gas</text>
  <text start="1299.429" dur="4.2">they have the ability to create</text>
  <text start="1301.62" dur="4.86">biological weapons which they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="1303.629" dur="7.53">on now and they&amp;#39;re saying there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1306.48" dur="7.86">strong possibility that they might hit</text>
  <text start="1311.159" dur="4.791">the West for financial gain which makes</text>
  <text start="1314.34" dur="5.03">absolutely no sense at this point</text>
  <text start="1315.95" dur="5.74">because as we know the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="1319.37" dur="6.009">a proxy army for the United States</text>
  <text start="1321.69" dur="6.449">government they would never attack the</text>
  <text start="1325.379" dur="5.611">United States unless the u.s. gives it</text>
  <text start="1328.139" dur="6.361">the okay which they&amp;#39;re not going to do</text>
  <text start="1330.99" dur="7.11">because they need to control the next</text>
  <text start="1334.5" dur="8.149">false flag and whatever event they</text>
  <text start="1338.1" dur="9.39">choose it has to be big to explain away</text>
  <text start="1342.649" dur="7.211">why they need to go into Syria now it</text>
  <text start="1347.49" dur="4.889">just can&amp;#39;t be a shootout it has to be</text>
  <text start="1349.86" dur="3.84">something even bigger than that it might</text>
  <text start="1352.379" dur="4.26">even happen throughout europe and the</text>
  <text start="1353.7" dur="5.16">united states at once to say we need to</text>
  <text start="1356.639" dur="4.111">go in there once and for all with ground</text>
  <text start="1358.86" dur="5.12">troops to eliminate the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1360.75" dur="5.51">and you know this is not going</text>
  <text start="1363.98" dur="3.93">to be against the Islamic state it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1366.26" dur="6.24">way of getting the ground troops into</text>
  <text start="1367.91" dur="10.17">Syria and this will kick off World War</text>
  <text start="1372.5" dur="9.99">three hopefully Putin has some type of</text>
  <text start="1378.08" dur="8.61">plan to stop this because I don&amp;#39;t want a</text>

  <text start="1401.99" dur="5.55">right now to send troops and to give the</text>
  <text start="1404.84" dur="7.38">power to the president because nobody</text>
  <text start="1407.54" dur="7.86">wants war but again our government they</text>
