  <text start="41.64" dur="6.33">episode is the economy is fine if you</text>
  <text start="44.22" dur="7.26">believe in the illusion let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="47.97" dur="5.729">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="51.48" dur="3.84">today we see the market has been pushed</text>
  <text start="53.699" dur="3.93">up we know we&amp;#39;re on the eve of the</text>
  <text start="55.32" dur="5.04">brexit gold has been suppressed once</text>
  <text start="57.629" dur="5.041">again they brought it down and when</text>
  <text start="60.36" dur="5.009">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at all the economic</text>
  <text start="62.67" dur="5.46">indicators we realize and we understand</text>
  <text start="65.369" dur="5.401">that this is one gigantic illusion I</text>
  <text start="68.13" dur="4.76">mean if you believe in it yeah you&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="70.77" dur="4.92">fine for the short run you&amp;#39;ll be fine</text>
  <text start="72.89" dur="5.53">for this time period but when the</text>
  <text start="75.69" dur="7.89">illusion ends that&amp;#39;s where the problem</text>
  <text start="78.42" dur="9.33">comes in the illusion ended in 2008 most</text>
  <text start="83.58" dur="7.41">of the people were caught off guard the</text>

  <text start="90.99" dur="7.95">only manipulate cheat lie fake for so</text>
  <text start="95.61" dur="5.13">long and eventually it does catch up</text>
  <text start="98.94" dur="3.929">with you because you have to remember</text>
  <text start="100.74" dur="4.439">the strength of this economy it is the</text>
  <text start="102.869" dur="4.92">people it&amp;#39;s not the central bank</text>
  <text start="105.179" dur="4.431">creating currency out of thin air it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="107.789" dur="4.47">not the central bank blowing up bubbles</text>
  <text start="109.61" dur="4.78">it&amp;#39;s not the central brain giving free</text>
  <text start="112.259" dur="4.47">money to banks and hedge funds</text>
  <text start="114.39" dur="5.22">investment companies to pump up the</text>
  <text start="116.729" dur="6.661">market to purchase thousands and</text>
  <text start="119.61" dur="6.81">thousands of pieces of real estate the</text>
  <text start="123.39" dur="5.49">people there the driver of the economy</text>
  <text start="126.42" dur="5.49">if the people are sitting on the</text>
  <text start="128.88" dur="5.52">sidelines if the people don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="131.91" dur="4.5">jobs if the people are being laid off if</text>
  <text start="134.4" dur="5.37">the people don&amp;#39;t have discretionary</text>
  <text start="136.41" dur="7.14">funds disposable income to go out and</text>
  <text start="139.77" dur="5.76">purchase goods the economy is not going</text>
  <text start="143.55" dur="4.53">to thrive because if they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="145.53" dur="5.31">purchasing goods retail is going to</text>
  <text start="148.08" dur="5.43">direct their retail contracts there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="150.84" dur="6.57">reason to manufacture there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="153.51" dur="5.22">to manufacture the economy continually</text>
  <text start="157.41" dur="2.73">shrinks</text>
  <text start="158.73" dur="3.96">and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="160.14" dur="3.569">but of course the US government central</text>
  <text start="162.69" dur="3.439">bankers they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="163.709" dur="5.851">possibly can to manipulate the situation</text>
  <text start="166.129" dur="6.461">we see for instance the Department of</text>
  <text start="169.56" dur="6.569">Labor they&amp;#39;re saying that the initial</text>
  <text start="172.59" dur="5.58">jobless claims they have plunged to a 42</text>
  <text start="176.129" dur="5.601">year low now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="178.17" dur="6.569">about this is that the Fed they have</text>
  <text start="181.73" dur="5.95">their indicator which is the Fed labor</text>
  <text start="184.739" dur="4.771">market condition index and when you look</text>
  <text start="187.68" dur="4.29">at the Department of Labor and the Fed</text>
  <text start="189.51" dur="5.52">labor market condition index they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="191.97" dur="4.379">heading into different directions now</text>
  <text start="195.03" dur="3.569">the US government is telling us that</text>
  <text start="196.349" dur="4.401">we&amp;#39;re at 42 year lows even though we</text>
  <text start="198.599" dur="4.14">know from challenger gray &amp;amp; christmas</text>
  <text start="200.75" dur="3.609">corporations are continually laying off</text>
  <text start="202.739" dur="3.151">retails continually laying off and we</text>
  <text start="204.359" dur="3.361">know they manipulate these numbers and</text>
  <text start="205.89" dur="3.439">they massage the numbers to make it look</text>
  <text start="207.72" dur="4.859">really good and all those people that</text>
  <text start="209.329" dur="5.77">might be applying for initial claims</text>
  <text start="212.579" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re dropping off they&amp;#39;re not looking</text>
  <text start="215.099" dur="4.291">for a job we&amp;#39;re not even going to look</text>
  <text start="217.109" dur="4.921">at them and we&amp;#39;ll just manipulate this</text>
  <text start="219.39" dur="4.709">number lower and lower to make it jive</text>
  <text start="222.03" dur="4.92">with the four point seven percent</text>
  <text start="224.099" dur="5.281">unemployment number on the other hand we</text>
  <text start="226.95" dur="5.399">have the fed labor market index market</text>
  <text start="229.38" dur="7.32">condition index and this is moving in</text>
  <text start="232.349" dur="7.29">the opposite direction and we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="236.7" dur="4.969">at the situation where things are</text>
  <text start="239.639" dur="5.85">starting not to make sense anymore I</text>
  <text start="241.669" dur="6.521">mean even if we look at the Chicago feds</text>
  <text start="245.489" dur="6.18">national activity index which plunged to</text>
  <text start="248.19" dur="5.46">a negative point 51 now this is the</text>
  <text start="251.669" dur="3.69">worst level since january 2014 by the</text>
  <text start="253.65" dur="4.139">way the chicago fed national activity</text>
  <text start="255.359" dur="4.701">index this is a monthly index designed</text>
  <text start="257.789" dur="5.88">to gauge overall economic activity and</text>
  <text start="260.06" dur="7.69">related inflationary pressure and we see</text>
  <text start="263.669" dur="8.011">right now that under the surface things</text>
  <text start="267.75" dur="5.99">are ugly with only 28 of the 85 monthly</text>
  <text start="271.68" dur="4.76">individual indicators made positive</text>
  <text start="273.74" dur="6.64">contributions while 57 indicators</text>
  <text start="276.44" dur="7.39">deteriorated so this doesn&amp;#39;t bode well</text>
  <text start="280.38" dur="6.659">right now and we&amp;#39;re starting to see a</text>
  <text start="283.83" dur="5.579">lot of information economic indicators</text>
  <text start="287.039" dur="5.071">that conflict with each other yesterday</text>
  <text start="289.409" dur="5.851">we had the existing home sales</text>
  <text start="292.11" dur="6.57">they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;ve increased they</text>
  <text start="295.26" dur="6.12">surged and today we have the new home</text>
  <text start="298.68" dur="6.24">sales which have plunged the most in</text>
  <text start="301.38" dur="6.02">eight months very interesting we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="304.92" dur="5.37">seating we&amp;#39;re seeing the median price of</text>
  <text start="307.4" dur="6.43">homes tumbling to the lowest since June</text>
  <text start="310.29" dur="5.94">of 2015 and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="313.83" dur="5.37">is that the national association of</text>
  <text start="316.23" dur="4.47">realtors and the FHA they&amp;#39;re going in</text>
  <text start="319.2" dur="4.68">opposite direction and reporting the</text>
  <text start="320.7" dur="4.95">housing prices now again if we go to the</text>
  <text start="323.88" dur="4.86">street level and we start looking around</text>
  <text start="325.65" dur="5.61">and poking our nose into different real</text>
  <text start="328.74" dur="5.37">estate markets we get a sense that</text>
  <text start="331.26" dur="5.34">prices are actually coming down the</text>
  <text start="334.11" dur="4.23">bubble is popping we see it in San</text>
  <text start="336.6" dur="4.32">Francisco we see it in the luxury market</text>
  <text start="338.34" dur="4.89">in New York we&amp;#39;re starting to see it in</text>
  <text start="340.92" dur="4.44">the outskirts around all the different</text>
  <text start="343.23" dur="5.25">areas in the Northeast the South the</text>
  <text start="345.36" dur="5.28">Midwest the west and there&amp;#39;s just small</text>
  <text start="348.48" dur="5.91">pockets right now we were seeing prices</text>
  <text start="350.64" dur="5.25">continually being pushed up and when we</text>
  <text start="354.39" dur="3.84">continually look at this we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="355.89" dur="6.39">to realize that none of this is really</text>
  <text start="358.23" dur="5.85">making any sense at all because what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="362.28" dur="4.02">happening is they&amp;#39;re trying to keep this</text>
  <text start="364.08" dur="4.8">illusion alive that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="366.3" dur="3.9">that the economy is doing well remember</text>
  <text start="368.88" dur="3.54">the American people have been sitting on</text>
  <text start="370.2" dur="4.35">the sidelines while the central bank has</text>
  <text start="372.42" dur="4.62">been pumping up the bubbles in the</text>
  <text start="374.55" dur="6.26">market in the bond market in the auto</text>
  <text start="377.04" dur="6.33">loan market in the housing market and</text>
  <text start="380.81" dur="5.26">they&amp;#39;re continually doing this meanwhile</text>
  <text start="383.37" dur="4.92">as they pump up the bubbles they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="386.07" dur="5.55">manipulating the data to fit everything</text>
  <text start="388.29" dur="6.87">and what happens is as time goes on</text>
  <text start="391.62" dur="7.02">these things start to separate reality</text>
  <text start="395.16" dur="5.28">sets in and things start not to make</text>
  <text start="398.64" dur="4.08">sense and this is exactly what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="400.44" dur="4.11">happening right now the corporate media</text>
  <text start="402.72" dur="5.46">on the other hand will be out there in</text>
  <text start="404.55" dur="5.13">any little pop they&amp;#39;re going to make it</text>
  <text start="408.18" dur="4.05">seem like everything is rebounding and</text>
  <text start="409.68" dur="4.68">everything is fine but when you step</text>
  <text start="412.23" dur="6.06">back and you look at the overall picture</text>
  <text start="414.36" dur="7.05">you see there&amp;#39;s a downward trend for</text>
  <text start="418.29" dur="6.05">instance market is out there and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="421.41" dur="6.71">ma ma RK IT not the more</text>
  <text start="424.34" dur="6.42">this is markets us manufacturing PMI for</text>
  <text start="428.12" dur="8.329">June it has beat expectations and</text>
  <text start="430.76" dur="8.4">they&amp;#39;re saying it rose from 50.7 to 51.4</text>
  <text start="436.449" dur="5.921">but when we step back and we take a look</text>
  <text start="439.16" dur="4.319">at this well things don&amp;#39;t look good now</text>
  <text start="442.37" dur="4.17">of course the corporate media is out</text>
  <text start="443.479" dur="5.881">there saying this is incredible but when</text>
  <text start="446.54" dur="5.099">we look and we go back in time we see a</text>
  <text start="449.36" dur="5.839">completely different picture because</text>
  <text start="451.639" dur="7.081">when we go back to 2014 we see</text>
  <text start="455.199" dur="6.851">manufacturing was around 60 and then it</text>
  <text start="458.72" dur="6.449">dropped down to about 55 in the middle</text>
  <text start="462.05" dur="5.22">of 2014 and then we hit a surge back up</text>
  <text start="465.169" dur="4.321">to about 57 and they said the economy is</text>
  <text start="467.27" dur="4.44">rebounding Manufacturing&amp;#39;s back on track</text>
  <text start="469.49" dur="6.78">and then all of a sudden it dropped</text>
  <text start="471.71" dur="7.56">right back down to 55 and then it</text>
  <text start="476.27" dur="10.769">started to decrease decline i should say</text>
  <text start="479.27" dur="9.93">to 52.5 down to 50 and we&amp;#39;ve had this</text>
  <text start="487.039" dur="3.811">little pop-up once again and when we</text>
  <text start="489.2" dur="3.42">look at this trend we see that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="490.85" dur="5.1">going to continually trend it downward</text>
  <text start="492.62" dur="5.07">and that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re headed and this</text>
  <text start="495.95" dur="5.58">does not this is not a good sign</text>
  <text start="497.69" dur="6.24">actually the three months to june has</text>
  <text start="501.53" dur="4.139">seen the worst quarter for manufacturing</text>
  <text start="503.93" dur="5.88">in terms of both production and</text>
  <text start="505.669" dur="7.591">employment growth since 2009 so this</text>
  <text start="509.81" dur="5.43">situation that they continually tell us</text>
  <text start="513.26" dur="4.67">about and they continually put out that</text>
  <text start="515.24" dur="5.52">everything is rebounding no it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="517.93" dur="6.34">we&amp;#39;re seeing little pop-ups on the way</text>
  <text start="520.76" dur="5.97">down that&amp;#39;s not a situation where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="524.27" dur="6.95">improving it&amp;#39;s a situation where things</text>
  <text start="526.73" dur="8.52">are actually getting worse now the EU is</text>
  <text start="531.22" dur="8.17">completely off their rocker because the</text>
  <text start="535.25" dur="7.91">EU is now studying a proposal that would</text>
  <text start="539.39" dur="6.81">count robots as people for tax purposes</text>
  <text start="543.16" dur="5.32">which is absolutely ridiculous and you</text>
  <text start="546.2" dur="5.49">can see once they start heading down</text>
  <text start="548.48" dur="5.729">this path that means they&amp;#39;re in big</text>
  <text start="551.69" dur="3.84">trouble that means they need more</text>
  <text start="554.209" dur="3.331">revenue and they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out</text>
  <text start="555.53" dur="6.84">any way they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="557.54" dur="7.409">ring revenue into their system they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="562.37" dur="6.35">saying Europe&amp;#39;s robots to become</text>

  <text start="590.54" dur="8.13">ridiculous but they need revenue and you</text>
  <text start="596.839" dur="3.631">can see they&amp;#39;re going to do whatever</text>
  <text start="598.67" dur="4.979">they possibly can to bring revenue in to</text>
  <text start="600.47" dur="5.19">keep their system operational because as</text>

  <text start="612.589" dur="8.401">this system alive any way they know how</text>
  <text start="615.699" dur="9.01">and we know they will go to any lengths</text>
  <text start="620.99" dur="9.599">to do this now we see we are on the eve</text>
  <text start="624.709" dur="9.961">of the brexit and we know that the</text>
  <text start="630.589" dur="7.141">central bank the powers that be do you</text>
  <text start="634.67" dur="8.94">really think they&amp;#39;re going to let the</text>

  <text start="643.61" dur="7.169">think about it when has governments or</text>

  <text start="718.43" dur="5.01">around 7,000 eligible voters the</text>

  <text start="723.44" dur="8.04">Sicily which has about 1,700 voters now</text>
  <text start="728.81" dur="6.24">very interestingly there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="731.48" dur="6.56">no exit poll whatsoever now exit polls</text>
  <text start="735.05" dur="7.92">are actually good because it keeps an</text>
  <text start="738.04" dur="8.56">eye on the manipulation factor because</text>
  <text start="742.97" dur="5.37">as people leave the voting polls they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="746.6" dur="3.48">asked how do they vote of course why</text>
  <text start="748.34" dur="4.35">would they lie at this point there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="750.08" dur="4.26">reason to do this and they can take</text>
  <text start="752.69" dur="5.12">those exit polls and they can match them</text>
  <text start="754.34" dur="6.3">up with the results that the official</text>
  <text start="757.81" dur="5.35">government bodies are telling us the</text>
  <text start="760.64" dur="4.53">results are and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="763.16" dur="5.45">they&amp;#39;re going to be no exit polls</text>
  <text start="765.17" dur="6.03">whatsoever and this is kind of a sign of</text>
  <text start="768.61" dur="4.06">manipulation because when scotland was</text>
  <text start="771.2" dur="5.25">having their vote there were no exit</text>
  <text start="772.67" dur="5.52">polls there either now the voters are</text>
  <text start="776.45" dur="3.57">going to be given a piece of paper with</text>
  <text start="778.19" dur="3.96">a question should the United Kingdom</text>
  <text start="780.02" dur="5.85">remain a member of the European Union or</text>
  <text start="782.15" dur="5.31">leave the European Union they&amp;#39;ll ask to</text>
  <text start="785.87" dur="5.76">be they&amp;#39;ll be asked to put a cross</text>
  <text start="787.46" dur="8.76">beside either of these questions now the</text>
  <text start="791.63" dur="6.54">vote once it&amp;#39;s done it cannot be</text>
  <text start="796.22" dur="3.9">challenged this is going to be very</text>
  <text start="798.17" dur="3.69">unlikely that this will happen the</text>
  <text start="800.12" dur="5.1">Electoral Commission says the rules do</text>
  <text start="801.86" dur="6.3">not provide for a national recount under</text>
  <text start="805.22" dur="6.12">any circumstances so we&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="808.16" dur="8.31">to sit back and watch this but my take</text>
  <text start="811.34" dur="8.97">on this entire thing is at the central</text>
  <text start="816.47" dur="5.97">bankers the government body they are not</text>
  <text start="820.31" dur="5.01">going to let the people decide now if</text>
  <text start="822.44" dur="5.85">the people decide that they want</text>
  <text start="825.32" dur="6.81">to exit let&amp;#39;s think about this for a</text>
  <text start="828.29" dur="6.96">second they let the people decide to</text>
  <text start="832.13" dur="6.18">exit the EU now remember the EU is made</text>
  <text start="835.25" dur="6.51">up of a non-elected system the people</text>
  <text start="838.31" dur="5.52">have no say in what they do and the</text>
  <text start="841.76" dur="4.71">central bankers the government they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="843.83" dur="4.38">just going to let the people say yeah we</text>
  <text start="846.47" dur="4.17">want to be out of here this would have</text>
  <text start="848.21" dur="4.26">an effect where other countries will</text>
  <text start="850.64" dur="4.86">decide you know what let&amp;#39;s do the same</text>
  <text start="852.47" dur="5.6">exact thing the only reason i would say</text>
  <text start="855.5" dur="5.99">they would allow this at this point</text>
  <text start="858.07" dur="6.48">where the people say yes let&amp;#39;s leave</text>
  <text start="861.49" dur="6.78">well i think they would use it to say</text>
  <text start="864.55" dur="7.63">because the people decided to do this</text>
  <text start="868.27" dur="6.85">they crash the economies they crashed</text>
  <text start="872.18" dur="5.55">europe which bled into the united states</text>
  <text start="875.12" dur="3.87">and they brought the economy down</text>
  <text start="877.73" dur="4.08">because remember the central banking</text>
  <text start="878.99" dur="5.82">system they know that they can&amp;#39;t keep</text>
  <text start="881.81" dur="8.33">the system going for much longer and if</text>
  <text start="884.81" dur="9.03">they do allow this they will use it to</text>
  <text start="890.14" dur="8.08">benefit themselves they will use it to</text>
  <text start="893.84" dur="6.18">blame it on the people for this entire</text>
  <text start="898.22" dur="4.2">system collapsing but we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="900.02" dur="5.46">have to wait to see how this entire</text>
  <text start="902.42" dur="4.86">thing turns out listen everyone thanks a</text>
  <text start="905.48" dur="5.99">lot for listening be well be safe and</text>
