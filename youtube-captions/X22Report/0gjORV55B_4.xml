  <text start="76.07" dur="4.47">different indicators here in the US and</text>
  <text start="77.869" dur="5.461">across the world and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="80.54" dur="4.77">see things really fall apart I mean</text>
  <text start="83.33" dur="4.5">things are just declining very very</text>
  <text start="85.31" dur="4.65">rapidly and this is just not in the</text>
  <text start="87.83" dur="4.86">housing arena it&amp;#39;s just not in the</text>
  <text start="89.96" dur="4.74">retail arena it&amp;#39;s pretty much everything</text>
  <text start="92.69" dur="3.99">that we&amp;#39;re looking at if we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="94.7" dur="4.22">at student loan debt or credit card debt</text>
  <text start="96.68" dur="4.74">savings we&amp;#39;re looking at manufacturing</text>

  <text start="101.42" dur="5.15">at all automobiles we&amp;#39;re looking at all</text>
  <text start="103.97" dur="5.819">this stuff what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a</text>
  <text start="106.57" dur="4.56">decline in all these different sectors</text>
  <text start="109.789" dur="4.021">and they&amp;#39;re starting to accelerate</text>
  <text start="111.13" dur="6.22">actually in many of the countries we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="113.81" dur="5.669">starting to see certain cracks in the</text>
  <text start="117.35" dur="4.68">bubbles that have been blowing up for a</text>
  <text start="119.479" dur="4.381">very long time this is the bubbles that</text>
  <text start="122.03" dur="4.769">have been blowing up since the last</text>
  <text start="123.86" dur="6.509">financial crisis of 2008 now in the UK</text>
  <text start="126.799" dur="5.94">we can see that retailers well they have</text>
  <text start="130.369" dur="6.391">just suffered the sharpest sales drop</text>
  <text start="132.739" dur="7.681">for 22 years in April the British Retail</text>

  <text start="147.829" dur="4.38">drop in business in more than two</text>
  <text start="149.239" dur="5.791">decades and we can see out in Canada the</text>
  <text start="152.209" dur="4.741">housing bubble is popping and things are</text>
  <text start="155.03" dur="4.019">starting to really break apart here in</text>
  <text start="156.95" dur="3.9">the United States we are seeing so many</text>
  <text start="159.049" dur="4.771">different indicators they are flashing</text>
  <text start="160.85" dur="6.479">red signals saying something bad is</text>
  <text start="163.82" dur="6.24">headed our way and one of the signs is</text>
  <text start="167.329" dur="5.25">consumer debt now we we see that</text>
  <text start="170.06" dur="4.98">consumer debt has been rising since the</text>
  <text start="172.579" dur="4.981">last financial crisis during the last</text>
  <text start="175.04" dur="6.8">financial crisis we hit around 2.6</text>
  <text start="177.56" dur="8.37">trillion in consumer credit debt and</text>
  <text start="181.84" dur="5.19">today we&amp;#39;ve completely surpassed that we</text>
  <text start="185.93" dur="5.81">are now</text>
  <text start="187.03" dur="8.47">3.8 two trillion and this is just</text>
  <text start="191.74" dur="7.15">unbelievable because we are just piling</text>
  <text start="195.5" dur="6.27">on debt faster than the overall economy</text>
  <text start="198.89" dur="5.67">is growing now if we go back in time and</text>
  <text start="201.77" dur="5.66">we go back to 2008 we can see there was</text>
  <text start="204.56" dur="6.84">a short period of time between 2008 to</text>
  <text start="207.43" dur="6.1">2010 2011 where a lot of consumers they</text>
  <text start="211.4" dur="3.84">deleveraged mostly by defaulting on</text>
  <text start="213.53" dur="4.32">their debts but it didn&amp;#39;t last long</text>
  <text start="215.24" dur="3.84">because again what do we see what are we</text>
  <text start="217.85" dur="2.88">seeing in the economy a lot of people</text>
  <text start="219.08" dur="4.56">losing their jobs a lot of people</text>
  <text start="220.73" dur="5.58">getting lower paying jobs wages are</text>
  <text start="223.64" dur="4.08">decreasing and people need to survive</text>
  <text start="226.31" dur="3.21">now a lot of people don&amp;#39;t want to use</text>
  <text start="227.72" dur="4.35">the funds that are in the bank so they</text>
  <text start="229.52" dur="5.97">keep those funds in the bank and they</text>
  <text start="232.07" dur="5.16">use credit to make ends meet because you</text>
  <text start="235.49" dur="3.9">don&amp;#39;t want to have zero in the bank just</text>
  <text start="237.23" dur="3.96">in case something big does happen or</text>
  <text start="239.39" dur="3.96">your credit cards get cancelled and you</text>
  <text start="241.19" dur="3.42">need that cash so a lot of people turn</text>
  <text start="243.35" dur="3.66">to credit and this is what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="244.61" dur="5.04">saying because over the ten years since</text>
  <text start="247.01" dur="5.34">the first quarter of 2008 consumer debt</text>
  <text start="249.65" dur="4.77">has now surged 47 percent over the same</text>
  <text start="252.35" dur="4.05">period the Consumer Price Index has</text>
  <text start="254.42" dur="4.62">increased by sixteen point nine percent</text>
  <text start="256.4" dur="6.21">and when we look at credit card balances</text>
  <text start="259.04" dur="5.97">I mean we have basically beat the</text>
  <text start="262.61" dur="5.19">all-time record which was back in the</text>
  <text start="265.01" dur="4.98">fourth quarter of 2008 when everyone was</text>
  <text start="267.8" dur="4.32">just piling on a lot of debt during that</text>
  <text start="269.99" dur="4.89">period of time we had a huge housing</text>
  <text start="272.12" dur="5.1">bubble people were taking out the equity</text>
  <text start="274.88" dur="4.35">line of credits on their homes because</text>
  <text start="277.22" dur="3.03">home prices were continually moving up</text>
  <text start="279.23" dur="3.12">and up and up and everything just</text>
  <text start="280.25" dur="3.24">started to crash and people just had a</text>
  <text start="282.35" dur="3.9">lot of debt and this is why a lot of</text>
  <text start="283.49" dur="6.72">people defaulted but back then we had</text>
  <text start="286.25" dur="7.26">credit card balances of about 977</text>
  <text start="290.21" dur="5.85">billion well we beat that we&amp;#39;re at one</text>
  <text start="293.51" dur="6.54">point zero three trillion this is an</text>
  <text start="296.06" dur="7.17">all-time new record high and you need to</text>
  <text start="300.05" dur="6.63">remember the central banks they thrive</text>
  <text start="303.23" dur="5.73">on debt they love student loan debt they</text>
  <text start="306.68" dur="4.89">love credit card debt they love</text>
  <text start="308.96" dur="5.209">automobile debt because we need to</text>
  <text start="311.57" dur="6.09">understand how their system works they</text>
  <text start="314.169" dur="6.161">prosper by having people in debt they</text>
  <text start="317.66" dur="5.52">can control that they can give you</text>
  <text start="320.33" dur="5.7">where they created out of thin air and</text>
  <text start="323.18" dur="5.82">say hey take out an automobile loan you</text>
  <text start="326.03" dur="6.18">can get a car take out a student loan</text>
  <text start="329" dur="6">you can go to college use credit which</text>
  <text start="332.21" dur="4.56">is just free funny money and you can</text>
  <text start="335" dur="4.439">purchase whatever you need they can</text>
  <text start="336.77" dur="4.98">control that but they can&amp;#39;t control</text>
  <text start="339.439" dur="5.461">people getting jobs people actually</text>
  <text start="341.75" dur="5.099">saving and using real cash that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="344.9" dur="4.289">little bit more difficult and this has</text>
  <text start="346.849" dur="4.831">been their problem for a very long time</text>
  <text start="349.189" dur="5.19">right now we see host sale inventories</text>
  <text start="351.68" dur="4.59">wholesale sales and inventories they</text>
  <text start="354.379" dur="5.01">have disappointed in March they both</text>
  <text start="356.27" dur="5.31">slowed by 0.3% month on month wholesale</text>
  <text start="359.389" dur="4.5">sales slowed from an upwardly revised</text>
  <text start="361.58" dur="6.51">1.1 percent month on month in February</text>
  <text start="363.889" dur="6.691">to 0.3% month a month in March and if we</text>
  <text start="368.09" dur="5.039">look at the sales break down we can see</text>
  <text start="370.58" dur="4.619">durable goods in March they are down by</text>
  <text start="373.129" dur="3.72">negative 0.3% automotive down by</text>
  <text start="375.199" dur="3.09">negative one point six percent furniture</text>
  <text start="376.849" dur="3.57">down by negative one point seven percent</text>
  <text start="378.289" dur="3.93">lumber down negative one point three</text>
  <text start="380.419" dur="5.12">percent and it goes on and on and on and</text>
  <text start="382.219" dur="6.211">we can see that things again are</text>
  <text start="385.539" dur="5.201">indicating that we are headed to major</text>
  <text start="388.43" dur="5.07">major problems now if we look at</text>
  <text start="390.74" dur="5.549">additional indicators we can see that</text>
  <text start="393.5" dur="5.25">there are economic problems ahead and</text>
  <text start="396.289" dur="5.821">these are actually signals letting us</text>
  <text start="398.75" dur="6.06">know something bad is headed our way now</text>
  <text start="402.11" dur="4.619">again people think that the economy is</text>
  <text start="404.81" dur="4.109">doing well if you ask people on the</text>
  <text start="406.729" dur="4.021">street they&amp;#39;ll say yeah the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="408.919" dur="4.68">doing great everything looks good the</text>
  <text start="410.75" dur="5.729">corporate media is out there sending</text>
  <text start="413.599" dur="4.56">mixed messages right now some say the</text>
  <text start="416.479" dur="3.81">economy is not that great everything</text>
  <text start="418.159" dur="3.301">Trump&amp;#39;s doing is not that great others</text>
  <text start="420.289" dur="2.731">are still on the bandwagon that</text>
  <text start="421.46" dur="4.5">everything is fine because you have to</text>
  <text start="423.02" dur="4.619">remember nothing has changed all the</text>
  <text start="425.96" dur="4.53">calculations everything that&amp;#39;s been done</text>
  <text start="427.639" dur="6.03">is exactly the same and what has</text>
  <text start="430.49" dur="5.639">happened since 2008 they haven&amp;#39;t changed</text>
  <text start="433.669" dur="6.661">anything they&amp;#39;re following the same</text>
  <text start="436.129" dur="6.78">exact manipulative calculations but we</text>
  <text start="440.33" dur="4.739">can see that things are not fun right</text>
  <text start="442.909" dur="5.85">now the yield curve is dangerously close</text>
  <text start="445.069" dur="7.051">to flattening soon it will invert and if</text>
  <text start="448.759" dur="5.461">we look at the second 10 rule the spread</text>
  <text start="452.12" dur="4.41">between the 2-year Treasury and</text>
  <text start="454.22" dur="4.53">your bond we see the spread is at the</text>
  <text start="456.53" dur="5.7">lowest it&amp;#39;s been since the Great</text>
  <text start="458.75" dur="6.12">Recession of 2008 43 basis points that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="462.23" dur="5.04">it to put this all in perspective if the</text>
  <text start="464.87" dur="5.19">Fed hikes just two more times which is</text>
  <text start="467.27" dur="5.1">50 basis points and the ten-year keeps</text>
  <text start="470.06" dur="4.92">sticking below 3 percent then the yield</text>
  <text start="472.37" dur="4.77">curve will invert this is important</text>
  <text start="474.98" dur="4.35">because the yield curve inversion when</text>
  <text start="477.14" dur="6.45">the spread turns negative has preceded</text>
  <text start="479.33" dur="5.82">the last seven straight recessions if we</text>
  <text start="483.59" dur="3.48">only look at more Mardin time say the</text>
  <text start="485.15" dur="4.11">last 30 years we can see the spread</text>
  <text start="487.07" dur="5.52">collapse negative before a recession</text>
  <text start="489.26" dur="5.79">strikes so once again there is a huge</text>
  <text start="492.59" dur="5.19">problem here there is also the cash</text>
  <text start="495.05" dur="5.25">hoarding problem and that&amp;#39;s a bad signal</text>
  <text start="497.78" dur="5.37">of economic growth when things are very</text>
  <text start="500.3" dur="4.41">uncertain and become difficult and we</text>
  <text start="503.15" dur="2.91">know things are difficult for many many</text>
  <text start="504.71" dur="3.3">people where they&amp;#39;ve lost their jobs</text>
  <text start="506.06" dur="3.54">they might have gotten a part-time job</text>
  <text start="508.01" dur="3.93">or two part-time jobs but they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="509.6" dur="4.83">making the same amount of income wages</text>
  <text start="511.94" dur="5.219">they are declining many people who have</text>
  <text start="514.43" dur="5.549">lost their jobs can&amp;#39;t find a job people</text>
  <text start="517.159" dur="4.621">hoard their cash and they don&amp;#39;t like to</text>
  <text start="519.979" dur="3.211">spend their cash they&amp;#39;d rather use their</text>
  <text start="521.78" dur="4.35">credit cards like we were saying before</text>
  <text start="523.19" dur="5.399">and they&amp;#39;ll pull off dining out buying</text>
  <text start="526.13" dur="4.11">things they wanted and instead they keep</text>
  <text start="528.589" dur="2.791">their money in their bank they keep it</text>
  <text start="530.24" dur="3.27">there for a rainy day</text>
  <text start="531.38" dur="5.49">today Americans are saving at the</text>
  <text start="533.51" dur="6.42">highest levels since the 91 recession</text>
  <text start="536.87" dur="5.49">they are skittish about the future now</text>
  <text start="539.93" dur="4.44">if we go back in time we can see the</text>
  <text start="542.36" dur="3.99">difference in checking accounts</text>
  <text start="544.37" dur="6.87">the average checking account customer</text>
  <text start="546.35" dur="8.239">has around 3700 stashed away the median</text>
  <text start="551.24" dur="6.63">amount in checking account since 91 was</text>
  <text start="554.589" dur="5.471">2263 anything lower than this signifies</text>
  <text start="557.87" dur="4.89">the economy is doing well anything that</text>
  <text start="560.06" dur="5.22">is above indicates the economy is not</text>
  <text start="562.76" dur="4.05">doing well and the problem coincides</text>
  <text start="565.28" dur="3.66">with the sword and credit card debt and</text>
  <text start="566.81" dur="4.44">what that means is Americans would</text>
  <text start="568.94" dur="4.71">rather go into debt and finance their</text>
  <text start="571.25" dur="5.22">consumption while paying some interest</text>
  <text start="573.65" dur="6.03">instead of spending all of their money</text>
  <text start="576.47" dur="6.93">their actual cash up front another</text>
  <text start="579.68" dur="6.84">indicator is the South Korean export</text>
  <text start="583.4" dur="4.689">growth indicator the skeg many wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="586.52" dur="4.289">have guessed that South Korean</text>
  <text start="588.089" dur="3.87">a great leading indicator but they are</text>
  <text start="590.809" dur="3.34">historically</text>
  <text start="591.959" dur="4.86">looking back in time they&amp;#39;re an</text>
  <text start="594.149" dur="5.521">incredible indicator and what does this</text>
  <text start="596.819" dur="5.401">tell us it gives us a picture of what</text>
  <text start="599.67" dur="4.68">global corporate earnings are going to</text>
  <text start="602.22" dur="5.179">be so when we look at this we can see</text>
  <text start="604.35" dur="5.76">that the scag indicator turned negative</text>
  <text start="607.399" dur="6.1">when did it turn negative before it</text>
  <text start="610.11" dur="7.38">turned negative in 2008 it turned</text>
  <text start="613.499" dur="6.96">negative back in 2001 it turned negative</text>
  <text start="617.49" dur="5.13">going back every single time and what</text>
  <text start="620.459" dur="4.471">were we in we were in a recession and</text>
  <text start="622.62" dur="5.04">this means that the global corporate</text>
  <text start="624.93" dur="4.139">earnings will also turn negative so</text>
  <text start="627.66" dur="4.229">we&amp;#39;re looking at all these different</text>
  <text start="629.069" dur="5.19">indicators and they&amp;#39;re all showing us</text>
  <text start="631.889" dur="3.601">pretty much the same thing and if we go</text>
  <text start="634.259" dur="3.18">back in time from all the other</text>
  <text start="635.49" dur="3.839">indicators we looked at we can see that</text>
  <text start="637.439" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re all starting to make sense now</text>
  <text start="639.329" dur="4.411">now we know there is a battle right now</text>
  <text start="641.939" dur="3.51">between the central bank Trump and the</text>
  <text start="643.74" dur="5.069">Patriots where they want to gain the</text>
  <text start="645.449" dur="6.421">narrative of who brought down the</text>
  <text start="648.809" dur="6.03">economy why it was brought down who was</text>
  <text start="651.87" dur="4.649">responsible for it and this is what is</text>
  <text start="654.839" dur="3.72">happening at this point this is why the</text>
  <text start="656.519" dur="4.471">Fed it seems that they didn&amp;#39;t raise</text>

  <text start="667.499" dur="5.94">staredown game where they both want to</text>
  <text start="670.74" dur="4.829">gain the narrative but if we look at</text>
  <text start="673.439" dur="5.34">what has been going on and we look at</text>
  <text start="675.569" dur="6.12">the actual economic growth well the</text>
  <text start="678.779" dur="5.521">actual economic growth is slowing down</text>
  <text start="681.689" dur="6.57">and if we go back in time when we go</text>
  <text start="684.3" dur="5.82">back to the 70s 72 73 and we see the</text>
  <text start="688.259" dur="4.2">percentage there was that six percent if</text>
  <text start="690.12" dur="4.11">we go to 75 to nineteen eighty it has</text>
  <text start="692.459" dur="4.38">dropped down to four and a half percent</text>
  <text start="694.23" dur="5.729">if we go from eighty to eighty one the</text>
  <text start="696.839" dur="5.821">economic growth was about four point</text>
  <text start="699.959" dur="4.23">four percent if we go to 82 to 90 the</text>
  <text start="702.66" dur="4.769">economic growth was four percent if we</text>
  <text start="704.189" dur="4.71">go to 91 to 2001 the Act the economic</text>
  <text start="707.429" dur="5.07">growth was around three point five</text>
  <text start="708.899" dur="5.821">percent if we look at 2001 to 2007 the</text>
  <text start="712.499" dur="4.921">economic growth was about two point</text>
  <text start="714.72" dur="4.559">three percent and today the economic</text>
  <text start="717.42" dur="4.349">growth is much lower you have to</text>
  <text start="719.279" dur="4.17">remember the economic growth</text>
  <text start="721.769" dur="4.531">that we&amp;#39;re reporting them which is GDP</text>
  <text start="723.449" dur="4.38">they manipulated these numbers to make</text>
  <text start="726.3" dur="4.05">them a lot better if we look at the</text>
  <text start="727.829" dur="5.1">unmanipulated numbers it is well below</text>
  <text start="730.35" dur="4.679">1% actually there are some reporting</text>
  <text start="732.929" dur="4.921">that these numbers are in the negative</text>
  <text start="735.029" dur="7.23">territory so we are seeing economic</text>
  <text start="737.85" dur="6.589">growth slow and it&amp;#39;s not improving now</text>
  <text start="742.259" dur="5.281">if we take this and we look at the</text>
  <text start="744.439" dur="5.44">international GDP growth and we look at</text>
  <text start="747.54" dur="4.859">the three largest developed market</text>

  <text start="755.069" dur="6.151">improving we&amp;#39;re not seeing them increase</text>
  <text start="758.399" dur="7.62">we&amp;#39;re seeing them decline over time and</text>
  <text start="761.22" dur="7.589">if we look at 2017 to 2018 right now all</text>
  <text start="766.019" dur="6.06">we&amp;#39;re seeing is GDP growth has rolled</text>
  <text start="768.809" dur="5.671">over and it is declining right now this</text>
  <text start="772.079" dur="4.98">is not a good sign this is telling us</text>
  <text start="774.48" dur="5.43">that we are headed towards a recession</text>
  <text start="777.059" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;ve seen this before back when we had</text>
  <text start="779.91" dur="2.429">other recessions when we had the Great</text>
  <text start="781.619" dur="3.361">Depression</text>
  <text start="782.339" dur="5.1">we also see we have problems in the</text>
  <text start="784.98" dur="4.019">credit arena and we talked about that</text>
  <text start="787.439" dur="3.69">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="788.999" dur="4.82">credits going to freeze up when credit</text>
  <text start="791.129" dur="6.031">growth drops below two percent a</text>
  <text start="793.819" dur="6.041">recession almost always follows right</text>

  <text start="799.86" dur="4.529">percent since the beginning of the year</text>
  <text start="801.749" dur="4.861">this is pretty darn ugly and we see</text>
  <text start="804.389" dur="4.92">right now that all these different</text>
  <text start="806.61" dur="5.849">indicators are pointing to one thing and</text>
  <text start="809.309" dur="7.111">one thing only a recession and these are</text>
  <text start="812.459" dur="7.38">the manipulated numbers strip away the</text>
  <text start="816.42" dur="6.18">manipulation this economy is a complete</text>
  <text start="819.839" dur="4.47">and utter mess it&amp;#39;s collapsed already</text>
  <text start="822.6" dur="3.359">and we&amp;#39;re just keeping the whole thing</text>
  <text start="824.309" dur="3.36">propped up how do you keep something</text>
  <text start="825.959" dur="3.271">propped up like this without anyone</text>
  <text start="827.669" dur="3.48">noticing well let me change all the</text>
  <text start="829.23" dur="4.5">calculations you hand out the</text>
  <text start="831.149" dur="4.711">manipulated numbers you create currency</text>
  <text start="833.73" dur="4.5">you keep the banks afloat and you</text>
  <text start="835.86" dur="4.86">pretend that everything is fine they did</text>
  <text start="838.23" dur="3.899">this prior to 2008 and people say well</text>
  <text start="840.72" dur="3.059">what do you mean what did they</text>
  <text start="842.129" dur="2.94">manipulate well they told us these</text>
  <text start="843.779" dur="3.36">subprime securities for triple-a</text>
  <text start="845.069" dur="2.46">everyone believed it they kept investing</text>
  <text start="847.139" dur="2.79">in them</text>
  <text start="847.529" dur="4.56">pensions invested in them then we come</text>
  <text start="849.929" dur="4.47">to find out they lied that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="852.089" dur="3.571">manipulation same thing with all the</text>
  <text start="854.399" dur="3.301">corporations where there is</text>
  <text start="855.66" dur="4.02">that the corporations are fine AIG is</text>
  <text start="857.7" dur="3.99">fine Bear Stearns it&amp;#39;s fine Lehman&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="861.69" dur="3.48">bailout don&amp;#39;t worry about it</text>
  <text start="863.1" dur="4.11">otherwise they&amp;#39;re great oh wait we need</text>
  <text start="865.17" dur="4.59">another bailout oh we need one more</text>
  <text start="867.21" dur="4.44">bailout so if they needed three bailouts</text>
  <text start="869.76" dur="4.68">and then the automobile industry needed</text>
  <text start="871.65" dur="3.84">a bailout the banking institutions</text>
  <text start="874.44" dur="2.81">needed a bailout</text>
  <text start="875.49" dur="5.1">we relied about the subprime securities</text>
  <text start="877.25" dur="5.02">that&amp;#39;s how they kept the entire system</text>
  <text start="880.59" dur="3.45">afloat they even told us that real</text>
  <text start="882.27" dur="3.48">estate that&amp;#39;s not going to decrease it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="884.04" dur="4.14">contained everything&amp;#39;s fine</text>

  <text start="896.34" dur="4.59">couldn&amp;#39;t even lock in and many many</text>
  <text start="898.26" dur="4.89">people were just leaving their homes so</text>
  <text start="900.93" dur="4.11">they have the ability to manipulate now</text>
  <text start="903.15" dur="4.38">since that period of time they&amp;#39;ve</text>
