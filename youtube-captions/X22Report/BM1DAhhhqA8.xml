  <text start="136.15" dur="5.01">and other countries are been moving up</text>
  <text start="138.819" dur="4.191">steadily and people are having a very</text>
  <text start="141.16" dur="4.86">rough time making ends meet and right</text>
  <text start="143.01" dur="5.41">now the UN has come out with a report</text>
  <text start="146.02" dur="3.78">and they said the number of unemployed</text>
  <text start="148.42" dur="5.07">people around the world reach an</text>
  <text start="149.8" dur="6.84">estimated 200 and 1.8 million in 2013</text>
  <text start="153.49" dur="5.67">and there is a warning out there saying</text>
  <text start="156.64" dur="5.07">that the new job opportunities were not</text>
  <text start="159.16" dur="5.52">being created fast enough to absorb a</text>
  <text start="161.71" dur="5.01">growing workforce well let me just say</text>
  <text start="164.68" dur="4.77">how about all those people that got let</text>
  <text start="166.72" dur="5.25">go for austerity reasons what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="169.45" dur="4.38">reason why they can&amp;#39;t find work because</text>
  <text start="171.97" dur="4.68">they had a job at one point but they</text>
  <text start="173.83" dur="4.62">were removed from that job and now</text>
  <text start="176.65" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re looking for another job because</text>
  <text start="178.45" dur="5.27">that job doesn&amp;#39;t exist anymore and they</text>
  <text start="181.39" dur="5.28">go on to say if current trends continue</text>
  <text start="183.72" dur="5.17">global unemployment is set to worsen</text>
  <text start="186.67" dur="3.99">further the report said estimating that</text>
  <text start="188.89" dur="7.23">a global unemployment will climb to more</text>
  <text start="190.66" dur="8.94">than 215 million job seekers by 2018 I</text>
  <text start="196.12" dur="6.57">mean it is not getting better things are</text>
  <text start="199.6" dur="5.58">getting worse and it goes further into</text>
  <text start="202.69" dur="4.29">saying that you know we have we have</text>
  <text start="205.18" dur="3.779">this economic crisis right now and</text>
  <text start="206.98" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re showing that people are getting</text>
  <text start="208.959" dur="3.421">work and especially here in the US or</text>
  <text start="210.94" dur="4.47">saying oh no people are employed look</text>
  <text start="212.38" dur="5.1">unemployment sound a 6.7% but we realize</text>
  <text start="215.41" dur="4.38">that is an illusion that is a fake</text>
  <text start="217.48" dur="4.8">manipulated number and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="219.79" dur="4.62">saying now and this is a new report that</text>
  <text start="222.28" dur="4.23">just came out that the economic crisis</text>
  <text start="224.41" dur="5.43">across Europe has dramatically increased</text>
  <text start="226.51" dur="5.61">poverty among working population because</text>
  <text start="229.84" dur="5.04">what we realize is is that the people</text>
  <text start="232.12" dur="5.13">who are getting these jobs are not</text>
  <text start="234.88" dur="4.23">making the salaries to support their</text>
  <text start="237.25" dur="3.27">families if they&amp;#39;ve come from a</text>
  <text start="239.11" dur="3.36">full-time job they&amp;#39;re getting a</text>
  <text start="240.52" dur="3.99">part-time job and they&amp;#39;re making less</text>
  <text start="242.47" dur="4.32">money so it didn&amp;#39;t pull them out of</text>
  <text start="244.51" dur="6.63">poverty and they still can&amp;#39;t make ends</text>
  <text start="246.79" dur="7.23">meet and we see this all throughout</text>
  <text start="251.14" dur="5.159">Europe when we especially see it in the</text>
  <text start="254.02" dur="4.08">United States where all the numbers are</text>
  <text start="256.299" dur="3.69">completely manipulated right now I mean</text>
  <text start="258.1" dur="5.31">if we look at this we see that bammed</text>
  <text start="259.989" dur="6.631">air is laying off another 1,700 people</text>
  <text start="263.41" dur="6.509">flag start Bank Corp is laying off 700</text>
  <text start="266.62" dur="6.57">people Intel is laying off 5,000 plus</text>
  <text start="269.919" dur="4.941">more people Citibank is laying off</text>
  <text start="273.19" dur="3.77">another 650</text>
  <text start="274.86" dur="4.829">people as they&amp;#39;re selling off mortgage</text>
  <text start="276.96" dur="4.169">servicing rights and they&amp;#39;re laying off</text>
  <text start="279.689" dur="3.091">the people because they don&amp;#39;t need them</text>
  <text start="281.129" dur="3.271">because the housing market is collapsing</text>
  <text start="282.78" dur="3.81">and they don&amp;#39;t need people in their</text>
  <text start="284.4" dur="4.229">processing mortgages at this time and</text>
  <text start="286.59" dur="2.609">this is why we saw Wells Fargo lay off</text>
  <text start="288.629" dur="3.301">people</text>
  <text start="289.199" dur="4.65">Bank of America wet layoff people JP</text>
  <text start="291.93" dur="4.919">Morgan Chase lay off people because the</text>
  <text start="293.849" dur="5.1">housing market is declining and people</text>
  <text start="296.849" dur="4.741">are not taking out mortgages so they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="298.949" dur="5.94">laid off thousands and thousands of</text>
  <text start="301.59" dur="6.24">people and actually there was a Wall</text>
  <text start="304.889" dur="5.55">Street adviser and he&amp;#39;s saying that well</text>
  <text start="307.83" dur="5.489">the unreal unemployment rate is not 6.7%</text>
  <text start="310.439" dur="6.211">it&amp;#39;s around thirty seven point two</text>
  <text start="313.319" dur="6.63">percent and in a memo to clients</text>
  <text start="316.65" dur="5.579">provided two secrets David John Mirada</text>
  <text start="319.949" dur="6.27">calculates the actual unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="322.229" dur="6.69">of those not working at a sky-high 37.2%</text>
  <text start="326.219" dur="4.861">and of course it is not the six point</text>
  <text start="328.919" dur="4.56">seven that is advertised by the US</text>
  <text start="331.08" dur="6.329">government and the Fed it is completely</text>
  <text start="333.479" dur="6.93">the opposite and like we said they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="337.409" dur="6.331">changed most of the calculations they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="340.409" dur="5.461">changed GDP they in my recent reports I</text>
  <text start="343.74" dur="4.47">told you they changed inflation they</text>
  <text start="345.87" dur="5.34">changed unemployment and when things</text>
  <text start="348.21" dur="4.919">don&amp;#39;t fit their illusion what they do is</text>
  <text start="351.21" dur="3.23">they go and they change the calculations</text>
  <text start="353.129" dur="3.921">again that&amp;#39;s why they just changed</text>
  <text start="354.44" dur="5.77">inflation they had to recalculate it and</text>
  <text start="357.05" dur="5.859">just maybe about four or five months ago</text>
  <text start="360.21" dur="4.699">they had a recap we calculate GDP and</text>
  <text start="362.909" dur="5.94">they went all the way back to 1929 to</text>
  <text start="364.909" dur="5.591">recalculate GDP so GDP was in the green</text>
  <text start="368.849" dur="4.35">instead of being in the red of like</text>
  <text start="370.5" dur="3.99">negative four percent GDP that were</text>
  <text start="373.199" dur="3.301">running and now they can show that their</text>
  <text start="374.49" dur="4.709">GDP numbers are like positive two</text>
  <text start="376.5" dur="5.37">percent or so and they&amp;#39;ve done this to</text>
  <text start="379.199" dur="6.78">keep the illusion up this is what they</text>
  <text start="381.87" dur="6.78">have done now now the IMF has come out</text>
  <text start="385.979" dur="4.921">with their first forecast for 2014 and</text>
  <text start="388.65" dur="5.009">of course these numbers are very high</text>
  <text start="390.9" dur="5.46">and it is a forecast but they&amp;#39;re always</text>
  <text start="393.659" dur="4.771">wrong because instead of looking at the</text>
  <text start="396.36" dur="6.39">numbers they have given us let&amp;#39;s go back</text>
  <text start="398.43" dur="6.84">what they forecasted in 2012 for 2013</text>
  <text start="402.75" dur="4.469">and that you can see how wrong they</text>
  <text start="405.27" dur="3.24">really are that they they make these</text>
  <text start="407.219" dur="2.911">numbers up and a</text>
  <text start="408.51" dur="3.45">make people believe that things are</text>
  <text start="410.13" dur="4.89">getting better and things are going to</text>
  <text start="411.96" dur="7.34">really take off you know in the future</text>
  <text start="415.02" dur="8.64">here so back in 2012 what they said was</text>
  <text start="419.3" dur="6.61">they were expecting the the the world</text>
  <text start="423.66" dur="6.6">trade was going to grow by five point</text>
  <text start="425.91" dur="9.27">six five point six percent what actually</text>
  <text start="430.26" dur="7.8">happened in 2013 it actually grew by two</text>
  <text start="435.18" dur="5.58">point seven percent pretty much half a</text>
  <text start="438.06" dur="5.99">little more than half of what they said</text>
  <text start="440.76" dur="6.51">the same thing is going to happen they</text>
  <text start="444.05" dur="5.74">understand that we are headed for a</text>
  <text start="447.27" dur="4.89">collapse and things are not going to get</text>
  <text start="449.79" dur="4.92">better but they&amp;#39;re making and creating</text>
  <text start="452.16" dur="5.07">this illusion to make everyone believe</text>
  <text start="454.71" dur="4.29">that as we go forward people will be</text>
  <text start="457.23" dur="4.68">spending more people will be getting</text>
  <text start="459" dur="5.07">more jobs and don&amp;#39;t worry things will be</text>
  <text start="461.91" dur="4.89">getting the world trade and the world</text>
  <text start="464.07" dur="4.92">consumers and and the jobs are all going</text>
  <text start="466.8" dur="4.89">to be waiting there because we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="468.99" dur="6">to create what nothing there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="471.69" dur="6.09">for them to create they can&amp;#39;t do it all</text>
  <text start="474.99" dur="7.38">they know how to do is give each country</text>
  <text start="477.78" dur="7.14">more debt they tell each country to use</text>
  <text start="482.37" dur="4.11">austerity to control and just make sure</text>
  <text start="484.92" dur="3.42">you pay the interest on the debt and if</text>
  <text start="486.48" dur="3.93">you can&amp;#39;t we&amp;#39;ll give you more debt and</text>
  <text start="488.34" dur="4.44">you&amp;#39;ll lay off more people and cut</text>
  <text start="490.41" dur="4.5">programs and things like that that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="492.78" dur="3.63">they know here in the u.s. it&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="494.91" dur="3.42">different they have a printing press so</text>
  <text start="496.41" dur="5.01">all the government and the Fed know how</text>
  <text start="498.33" dur="5.34">to do is continually print money keep</text>
  <text start="501.42" dur="4.98">printing printing printing or creating</text>
  <text start="503.67" dur="4.29">however you want to say it they add to</text>
  <text start="506.4" dur="3.29">the debt they add to the debt they add</text>
  <text start="507.96" dur="4.62">to the debt the debt ceiling is</text>
  <text start="509.69" dur="4.659">absolutely meaningless because that has</text>
  <text start="512.58" dur="5.339">no bearing on anything anymore because</text>
  <text start="514.349" dur="6.421">if they stop borrowing this money the</text>
  <text start="517.919" dur="4.051">government cannot operate the campaign</text>
  <text start="520.77" dur="3.27">the interest they do not have the</text>
  <text start="521.97" dur="4.29">revenue from taxes this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="524.04" dur="3.93">searching around the world to get as</text>
  <text start="526.26" dur="3.57">much revenue as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="527.97" dur="3.42">because they realize that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="529.83" dur="3.54">to have to continually borrow and</text>
  <text start="531.39" dur="4.13">they&amp;#39;re going to raise the debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="533.37" dur="4.53">again because they have no choice they</text>
  <text start="535.52" dur="6.52">understand we&amp;#39;re in the endgame and</text>
  <text start="537.9" dur="7.59">there&amp;#39;s nothing else they can do now</text>
  <text start="542.04" dur="6.96">we understand that China is making its</text>
  <text start="545.49" dur="5.7">move and the dollar the US government</text>
  <text start="549" dur="4.29">the central bankers are threatened by</text>
  <text start="551.19" dur="4.08">the yuan and they see it they look</text>
  <text start="553.29" dur="4.62">around the world and we&amp;#39;re in war with</text>
  <text start="555.27" dur="4.59">China already if you look in Africa and</text>
  <text start="557.91" dur="4.74">you look in Libya and all these places</text>
  <text start="559.86" dur="5.97">China is always on the opposite side</text>
  <text start="562.65" dur="4.71">pouring in billions of dollars using US</text>
  <text start="565.83" dur="3.6">dollars because they don&amp;#39;t want to hold</text>
  <text start="567.36" dur="4.65">on to it and they&amp;#39;re using that money to</text>
  <text start="569.43" dur="4.41">build up the infrastructure of these</text>
  <text start="572.01" dur="4.5">different places in Africa they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="573.84" dur="5.13">pouring in money and there we have the</text>
  <text start="576.51" dur="4.35">puppet regime in Sudan which is</text>
  <text start="578.97" dur="4.26">controlled by the US government and the</text>
  <text start="580.86" dur="4.95">rebels which that&amp;#39;s what they call them</text>
  <text start="583.23" dur="4.41">are supported by China because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="585.81" dur="4.29">giving them money to support their</text>
  <text start="587.64" dur="4.89">infrastructure to drill for oil and to</text>
  <text start="590.1" dur="4.17">mine their natural resources same thing</text>
  <text start="592.53" dur="3.87">happened in Libya they&amp;#39;re pouring money</text>
  <text start="594.27" dur="4.62">into the infrastructure there and the</text>
  <text start="596.4" dur="4.44">u.s. invaded and put the puppet</text>
  <text start="598.89" dur="4.56">government so we&amp;#39;ve been fighting with</text>
  <text start="600.84" dur="6.21">China for quite a while at this quite a</text>
  <text start="603.45" dur="5.55">while now and the US government and the</text>
  <text start="607.05" dur="5.01">central bankers are completely</text>
  <text start="609" dur="5.13">threatened by China and the U one</text>
  <text start="612.06" dur="5.19">because they see what is happening and</text>
  <text start="614.13" dur="7.23">again the US Empire is keeping</text>
  <text start="617.25" dur="6.54">everything right now by using force by</text>
  <text start="621.36" dur="4.5">having people kill other people and this</text>
  <text start="623.79" dur="3.9">is what they&amp;#39;re doing China on the other</text>
  <text start="625.86" dur="2.28">hand and I&amp;#39;m not for China and not for</text>
  <text start="627.69" dur="3.18">Russia</text>
  <text start="628.14" dur="5.76">I&amp;#39;m an American but I&amp;#39;m just going by</text>
  <text start="630.87" dur="5.85">what I see and how I&amp;#39;m analyzing it</text>
  <text start="633.9" dur="4.2">China has been making deals they&amp;#39;ve been</text>

  <text start="724.05" dur="7.67">happening right now now China what they</text>
  <text start="726.99" dur="9.12">decided to do right now they decided to</text>
  <text start="731.72" dur="8.26">internationalize the gold market by</text>
  <text start="736.11" dur="7.26">tying a new gold spot contract to the</text>

  <text start="752.82" dur="6.12">buy the yuan so they can buy this gold</text>
  <text start="755.27" dur="6.22">contract so China&amp;#39;s complete aim in this</text>
  <text start="758.94" dur="6.389">whole thing is eventually to stand alone</text>
  <text start="761.49" dur="6.12">without the dollar so they are really</text>
  <text start="765.329" dur="5.401">starting to make their move they are</text>
  <text start="767.61" dur="6.75">pushing forward and from everything that</text>
  <text start="770.73" dur="5.07">we see they are really expanding right</text>
  <text start="774.36" dur="3.9">now there&amp;#39;s expanding their military</text>
  <text start="775.8" dur="4.14">because they understand all those</text>
  <text start="778.26" dur="4.38">countries that do not have a private</text>
  <text start="779.94" dur="4.08">western central bank realize that the</text>
  <text start="782.64" dur="2.79">central bankers are not just going to</text>
  <text start="784.02" dur="3.3">say okay you know what you just take</text>
  <text start="785.43" dur="3.45">over we&amp;#39;re just going to sit back we</text>
  <text start="787.32" dur="4.769">won&amp;#39;t be the reserve currency anymore</text>

  <text start="794.88" dur="6.63">currency China Russia North Korea all</text>
  <text start="799.11" dur="5.41">these countries realize this they</text>
  <text start="801.51" dur="5.02">realize what is going to happen</text>
  <text start="804.52" dur="3.87">and again other countries who are</text>
  <text start="806.53" dur="4.02">holding US Dollars and still making</text>
  <text start="808.39" dur="3.96">deals with China they see the writing on</text>
  <text start="810.55" dur="3.78">the wall and they see the US dollar is</text>
  <text start="812.35" dur="5.4">imploding collapsing and I said this</text>
  <text start="814.33" dur="5.04">many times once the United States the</text>
  <text start="817.75" dur="5.55">central bankers lose control the Middle</text>
  <text start="819.37" dur="6.6">East and Africa and people of these</text>
  <text start="823.3" dur="5.52">countries stop selling their natural</text>
  <text start="825.97" dur="4.89">resources using the US dollar every</text>
  <text start="828.82" dur="3.78">other country around the world will no</text>
  <text start="830.86" dur="4.05">longer need to hold on to the dollar</text>
  <text start="832.6" dur="4.44">anymore because they will not need it to</text>
  <text start="834.91" dur="4.92">buy the reserves if they want to buy oil</text>
  <text start="837.04" dur="5.94">from China right now they have to use</text>
  <text start="839.83" dur="4.95">the yuan and eventually the people that</text>
  <text start="842.98" dur="4.5">push the central bankers out of their</text>
  <text start="844.78" dur="5.13">countries and they decide to make a deal</text>
  <text start="847.48" dur="5.01">with China and say okay now we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="849.91" dur="5.28">to use the petrol you won everyone will</text>
  <text start="852.49" dur="4.77">start loading up on you wands instead of</text>
  <text start="855.19" dur="5.13">the US dollar and this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="857.26" dur="7.17">huge problem because again I said this</text>
  <text start="860.32" dur="7.08">many times those countries will not need</text>
  <text start="864.43" dur="5.31">the Treasuries they will not need the US</text>
  <text start="867.4" dur="4.74">Dollars and guess where all that goes</text>
  <text start="869.74" dur="4.64">that goes right back to the United</text>
  <text start="872.14" dur="6">States and then we have an influx of</text>
  <text start="874.38" dur="8.25">dollars hitting the streets and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="878.14" dur="8.88">going to see hyperinflation at that time</text>
  <text start="882.63" dur="7.3">okay now in regards to spying and Barack</text>
  <text start="887.02" dur="4.56">Obama out there giving his huge speech</text>
  <text start="889.93" dur="3.39">saying you know they&amp;#39;re going to rein in</text>
  <text start="891.58" dur="4.38">the NSA they&amp;#39;re going to make changes we</text>
  <text start="893.32" dur="5.79">all know this was a PR stunt but what</text>
  <text start="895.96" dur="6.09">happened was polls show that even after</text>
  <text start="899.11" dur="5.61">the speech Americans are not buying the</text>
  <text start="902.05" dur="5.04">NSA climbs they do not believe Barack</text>
  <text start="904.72" dur="7.41">Obama and they believe that he is still</text>
  <text start="907.09" dur="8.31">lying to every single person now in</text>
  <text start="912.13" dur="9.65">respect to the Middle East we realize</text>
  <text start="915.4" dur="9.54">that the goal of the central bankers is</text>
  <text start="921.78" dur="7.3">exactly the same as it always was their</text>
  <text start="924.94" dur="6.39">strategies have changed but again they</text>
  <text start="929.08" dur="3.99">want to remove Assad that is their major</text>
  <text start="931.33" dur="2.73">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s their goal pretty</text>
  <text start="933.07" dur="2.76">much</text>
  <text start="934.06" dur="5.82">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="935.83" dur="6.24">lot of these reports now come out that</text>
  <text start="939.88" dur="6.92">are coming out saying that the Assad</text>
  <text start="942.07" dur="7.41">regime is using systematic killing of</text>
  <text start="946.8" dur="4.81">detainees and they&amp;#39;re saying these are</text>
  <text start="949.48" dur="4.77">war crimes and I see more of this coming</text>
  <text start="951.61" dur="5.07">out and this one goes into saying that</text>
  <text start="954.25" dur="4.95">three international aid agencies issued</text>
  <text start="956.68" dur="4.23">a report on January 21st claiming the</text>
  <text start="959.2" dur="3.63">Syrian government is responsible for the</text>
  <text start="960.91" dur="4.5">systematic killing of approximately</text>
  <text start="962.83" dur="5.04">11,000 detainees held in Syrian jails</text>
  <text start="965.41" dur="5.37">and we can see this because they gave us</text>
  <text start="967.87" dur="5.04">a glimpse into this about a month ago</text>
  <text start="970.78" dur="6.18">when the UN said they are bringing</text>
  <text start="972.91" dur="6.18">charges up on Assad for work war crimes</text>
  <text start="976.96" dur="4.58">and they were bringing the report</text>
  <text start="979.09" dur="5.43">forward and now we see it coming out and</text>
  <text start="981.54" dur="6.15">of course among the first media outlets</text>
  <text start="984.52" dur="6.66">to obtain these reports where the UK</text>
  <text start="987.69" dur="5.11">Guardian and CNN and now CNN is running</text>
  <text start="991.18" dur="4.14">with it and the Guardian is running with</text>
  <text start="992.8" dur="6.99">it and they are definitely doing this to</text>
  <text start="995.32" dur="9.42">build up the the illusion that they need</text>
  <text start="999.79" dur="6.87">to go in there and remove Assad from but</text>
  <text start="1004.74" dur="3.78">because of the war crimes that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1006.66" dur="4.89">committing they did the same thing with</text>
  <text start="1008.52" dur="5.31">Gaddafi in Libya instead of the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1011.55" dur="5.28">going in there they had the UN forces go</text>
  <text start="1013.83" dur="5.01">in there and remove Qaddafi and of</text>
  <text start="1016.83" dur="4.23">course there were you and US forces in</text>
  <text start="1018.84" dur="5.01">there and then once he was removed what</text>
  <text start="1021.06" dur="4.38">happened was they dismantled the</text>
  <text start="1023.85" dur="4.11">government there they put in a puppet</text>
  <text start="1025.44" dur="4.38">regime and they started it using the US</text>
  <text start="1027.96" dur="3.33">dollar as a reserve currency again and</text>
  <text start="1029.82" dur="3.24">they started selling the natural</text>
  <text start="1031.29" dur="3.83">resources using the US dollar and the</text>
  <text start="1033.06" dur="4.35">same thing is going to happen here and</text>
  <text start="1035.12" dur="5.08">what the rebels</text>
  <text start="1037.41" dur="5.19">these are the CIA backed al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="1040.2" dur="4.44">faction that have been fighting against</text>
  <text start="1042.6" dur="3.6">Assad what they said is we will not</text>
  <text start="1044.64" dur="4.92">accept less than a removal of the</text>
  <text start="1046.2" dur="4.8">criminal Bashar al-assad and changing</text>
  <text start="1049.56" dur="5.19">the regime and holding the murderess</text>
  <text start="1051" dur="5.88">accountable so they have all this going</text>
  <text start="1054.75" dur="4.14">in and saying this is what they want to</text>
  <text start="1056.88" dur="3.93">do and they&amp;#39;re pretty much telling us</text>
  <text start="1058.89" dur="3.72">this John Kerry was out there telling us</text>
  <text start="1060.81" dur="5.22">this this is Rice was out there telling</text>
  <text start="1062.61" dur="4.7">telling us this and the false flag in</text>

  <text start="1067.31" dur="4.92">to do with chemical weapons the whole</text>
  <text start="1069.26" dur="7.5">name of the game was to get in there and</text>
  <text start="1072.23" dur="8.25">remove Assad from power put in a puppet</text>
  <text start="1076.76" dur="7.5">regime and put in a private western</text>
  <text start="1080.48" dur="5.25">central bank to sell the US dollar to</text>
  <text start="1084.26" dur="2.76">put the US dollar in the reserve</text>

  <text start="1087.02" dur="5.49">resources using the US dollar and this</text>
  <text start="1089.24" dur="4.92">is what they are doing right now this is</text>
  <text start="1092.51" dur="4.89">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do and they will</text>
  <text start="1094.16" dur="5.01">not stop doing this now to prove some of</text>
  <text start="1097.4" dur="4.77">their cases of course and I&amp;#39;ve mentioned</text>
  <text start="1099.17" dur="5.43">this before Syria which was reported in</text>
  <text start="1102.17" dur="4.62">CNN because they had secret Intel that</text>
  <text start="1104.6" dur="4.83">they had a cache of chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="1106.79" dur="5.31">that were hidden from the UN inspectors</text>
  <text start="1109.43" dur="6.15">and we can see that they&amp;#39;re building the</text>
  <text start="1112.1" dur="6.44">terrorists the terrorist propaganda up</text>
  <text start="1115.58" dur="6.36">and we can see out in Sochi right now</text>
  <text start="1118.54" dur="6.67">that they&amp;#39;re building this whole</text>
  <text start="1121.94" dur="4.68">terrorist propaganda up up up up to make</text>
  <text start="1125.21" dur="3.3">you believe that there are terrorists</text>
  <text start="1126.62" dur="3.48">all over the place and we are not safe</text>
  <text start="1128.51" dur="3.57">and this is why they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="1130.1" dur="3.78">terrorists are running free in the</text>
  <text start="1132.08" dur="3.96">United States and little that their lone</text>

  <text start="1138.47" dur="4.59">see this happening all over the place</text>
  <text start="1140.33" dur="6">and and they are definitely building up</text>
  <text start="1143.06" dur="4.92">for the main event because they realize</text>
  <text start="1146.33" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re headed towards the endgame here</text>
  <text start="1147.98" dur="5.64">and they need to do something and this</text>
  <text start="1151.46" dur="3.48">event is going to consist of many</text>
  <text start="1153.62" dur="2.88">different things and I believe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1154.94" dur="4.23">going to be a chemical weapon attack</text>
  <text start="1156.5" dur="5.16">it&amp;#39;ll probably like a dirty dirty nuke</text>
  <text start="1159.17" dur="5.46">attack and it will be definitely have</text>
  <text start="1161.66" dur="6.23">something to do with a what I like to</text>
  <text start="1164.63" dur="6.06">call a doomsday cyberattack event and</text>
  <text start="1167.89" dur="5.47">this is when they hit the power grid the</text>

  <text start="1566.46" dur="4.05">cancelled and reissued but it looked</text>
  <text start="1568.98" dur="3.27">like people were running and it looked</text>
  <text start="1570.51" dur="4.92">like bank runs actually when you see the</text>

  <text start="1575.43" dur="6.45">all the people there now in China they</text>
  <text start="1579.54" dur="4.89">have also got hit by a cyberattack so</text>

  <text start="1610.17" dur="5.49">more countries are getting hit and this</text>
  <text start="1612.81" dur="5.64">goes on to say that there was a major</text>

  <text start="1654.51" dur="8.16">all playing out the central bankers</text>
  <text start="1659.04" dur="5.43">realize that this is the endgame there</text>
  <text start="1662.67" dur="4.26">is no place for them to go they are</text>
  <text start="1664.47" dur="5.31">losing ground in the Middle East they&amp;#39;re</text>
