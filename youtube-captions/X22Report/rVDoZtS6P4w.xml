  <text start="91.97" dur="6.39">until Trump is sworn in but we can see</text>
  <text start="95.89" dur="4.75">parts of the illusion that they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="108.44" dur="6.66">on because what&amp;#39;s going to happen here</text>
  <text start="111.59" dur="5.849">is that as we come to the end of this</text>
  <text start="115.1" dur="6.689">year and we move into the beginning of</text>
  <text start="117.439" dur="7.14">next year and once Trump most likely if</text>

  <text start="131.69" dur="4.65">happen the day after he gets sworn in</text>
  <text start="133.42" dur="5.08">but we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot of the</text>
  <text start="136.34" dur="5.04">statistical information start to change</text>
  <text start="138.5" dur="5.75">I mean we&amp;#39;re already seeing bits and</text>

  <text start="151.43" dur="2.91">government will be out there trying to</text>
  <text start="152.78" dur="4.5">explain it away and why this is</text>
  <text start="154.34" dur="5.16">happening so quickly no say it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="157.28" dur="5.239">of Trump of course we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="159.5" dur="5.579">initial jobless claims start to move up</text>

  <text start="166.85" dur="5.28">the stores guess what they didn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="169.34" dur="5.369">do that well we&amp;#39;re gonna see other</text>
  <text start="172.13" dur="6.51">corporations start to layoff individuals</text>
  <text start="174.709" dur="7.11">and the GDP numbers are going to take a</text>
  <text start="178.64" dur="3.52">dive housing well the prices are going</text>

  <text start="184.83" dur="5.97">on the market longer longer and longer</text>
  <text start="186.57" dur="8.55">and this will be a type of creeping</text>
  <text start="190.8" dur="7.05">effect where each week each couple of</text>
  <text start="195.12" dur="5.91">weeks we will see the statistical</text>

  <text start="216.81" dur="7.47">we&amp;#39;ve been following we&amp;#39;ve been studying</text>
  <text start="219.84" dur="7.92">and when they&amp;#39;re ready to do it you will</text>
  <text start="224.28" dur="4.95">see the market come down to let everyone</text>
  <text start="227.76" dur="2.73">know that&amp;#39;s their signal that&amp;#39;s their</text>
  <text start="229.23" dur="5.52">red flare that they shoot up into the</text>
  <text start="230.49" dur="7.74">sky to say look everyone the system is</text>
  <text start="234.75" dur="7.8">done here and like I said before we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="238.23" dur="7.02">starting to see signs of this now</text>
  <text start="242.55" dur="5.97">initial jobless claims they have soared</text>
  <text start="245.25" dur="6.39">by over thirty five thousand or fifteen</text>
  <text start="248.52" dur="5.01">percent to five-month highs this is the</text>
  <text start="251.64" dur="7.469">biggest two-week rise since December of</text>
  <text start="253.53" dur="10.19">2014 now very interestingly right before</text>
  <text start="259.109" dur="8.191">the elections the initial jobless claims</text>
  <text start="263.72" dur="5.59">well they took a dive they went to 43</text>
  <text start="267.3" dur="7.41">year lows and then right after the</text>
  <text start="269.31" dur="7.73">elections boom everything changed now</text>
  <text start="274.71" dur="5.1">we&amp;#39;re starting to see this a little bit</text>
  <text start="277.04" dur="6.07">they&amp;#39;re gonna let things go a little bit</text>
  <text start="279.81" dur="7.56">at a time this is the signal that things</text>
  <text start="283.11" dur="9.09">are starting to fall apart even Dollar</text>
  <text start="287.37" dur="10.049">General the CEO Todd vasos he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="292.2" dur="7.89">something doesn&amp;#39;t seem right he his</text>
  <text start="297.419" dur="6.151">company missed its earning expectations</text>
  <text start="300.09" dur="5.79">and he&amp;#39;s saying that he&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="303.57" dur="3.57">surprised to admit that while on the</text>
  <text start="305.88" dur="1.86">surface things are supposed to be</text>
  <text start="307.14" dur="4.29">getting better</text>
  <text start="307.74" dur="7.08">the reality is vastly different for</text>
  <text start="311.43" dur="4.5">low-income US consumers he said I know</text>
  <text start="314.82" dur="3.87">that</text>
  <text start="315.93" dur="4.29">we look at globally the overall US</text>
  <text start="318.69" dur="3.99">population it seems like things are</text>
  <text start="320.22" dur="4.41">getting better but when you really start</text>
  <text start="322.68" dur="4.44">breaking it down and you look at the</text>
  <text start="324.63" dur="5.55">core consumer that we serve on the lower</text>
  <text start="327.12" dur="5.519">economic scale that&amp;#39;s out there the</text>
  <text start="330.18" dur="6">demographic things have not gotten any</text>
  <text start="332.639" dur="5.851">better for her and arguably they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="336.18" dur="4.82">worse and they&amp;#39;re worse because rents</text>
  <text start="338.49" dur="6.63">are accelerating Healthcare is</text>
  <text start="341" dur="9.19">accelerating and it&amp;#39;s doing this on a</text>
  <text start="345.12" dur="7.079">very rapid clip now we know that things</text>
  <text start="350.19" dur="8.61">are not getting better we understand</text>
  <text start="352.199" dur="11.131">this we know yes the wealthy the top</text>
  <text start="358.8" dur="7.29">individuals they are making money the</text>
  <text start="363.33" dur="7.74">middle class the lower-income suffering</text>
  <text start="366.09" dur="8.759">and this is just going to get worse now</text>
  <text start="371.07" dur="5.67">Obama is continually out there telling</text>
  <text start="374.849" dur="3.141">us that the job market is fine it sound</text>
  <text start="376.74" dur="5.94">a 4.9%</text>
  <text start="377.99" dur="8.47">everybody can get a job right then the</text>
  <text start="382.68" dur="6.09">question is why was there a hundred page</text>
  <text start="386.46" dur="4.47">report entitled federal student loans</text>
  <text start="388.77" dur="5.119">education needs to improve its income</text>
  <text start="390.93" dur="6.299">driven repayment plan budget estimates</text>
  <text start="393.889" dur="6.011">why did they put this out that said that</text>
  <text start="397.229" dur="4.5">taxpayers could be on the hook for a</text>
  <text start="399.9" dur="4.44">hundred and thirty seven billion on</text>
  <text start="401.729" dur="5.401">student loans to be forgiven over the</text>
  <text start="404.34" dur="5.34">coming years as a result of Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="407.13" dur="6.509">executive actions on income driven</text>
  <text start="409.68" dur="6.51">repayment plans now these are called</text>
  <text start="413.639" dur="4.831">IDRs they&amp;#39;re designed to help ease</text>
  <text start="416.19" dur="4.02">student debt burden by setting loan</text>
  <text start="418.47" dur="4.02">payments as a percentage of borrower</text>
  <text start="420.21" dur="4.949">income we talked about this before and</text>
  <text start="422.49" dur="5.34">they extended the repayment periods from</text>
  <text start="425.159" dur="6.54">the standard ten years up to 25 years</text>
  <text start="427.83" dur="6.66">and forgiving the remaining balances at</text>
  <text start="431.699" dur="6.601">the end of that period now my question</text>
  <text start="434.49" dur="5.07">is if this economy is so great and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="438.3" dur="2.82">down to four point nine percent</text>
  <text start="439.56" dur="4.89">unemployment if we want to go and</text>
  <text start="441.12" dur="7.26">believe the government why did we have</text>
  <text start="444.45" dur="5.189">to modify student loans where they</text>
  <text start="448.38" dur="4.8">modified</text>
  <text start="449.639" dur="7.56">back in the 80s no were they modified</text>
  <text start="453.18" dur="8.669">back in the 90s no why did they have to</text>
  <text start="457.199" dur="7.141">modify them according to the income why</text>
  <text start="461.849" dur="7.731">did they have to extend the payments up</text>
  <text start="464.34" dur="8.34">to 25 years I&amp;#39;m gonna tell you why</text>
  <text start="469.58" dur="7.42">because those individuals coming out of</text>
  <text start="472.68" dur="7.38">college they cannot find the high-paying</text>
  <text start="477" dur="6.21">jobs that they were promised most of</text>
  <text start="480.06" dur="5.219">them can find a part-time job right now</text>
  <text start="483.21" dur="6.6">a lot of them are living with their</text>
  <text start="485.279" dur="9.54">parents because there are no jobs out</text>
  <text start="489.81" dur="9.479">there for them that&amp;#39;s the main problem</text>
  <text start="494.819" dur="7.56">that&amp;#39;s why they did this and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="499.289" dur="4.74">starting to fall apart right now we see</text>
  <text start="502.379" dur="3.391">part of the illusion that they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="504.029" dur="4.44">to convince us of that everything is</text>
  <text start="505.77" dur="5.25">fine we&amp;#39;re seeing that US manufacturing</text>
  <text start="508.469" dur="6.391">PMI for November jumped to as highest</text>
  <text start="511.02" dur="5.639">since March of 2015 and as we go through</text>
  <text start="514.86" dur="4.94">this we&amp;#39;re going to see different things</text>
  <text start="516.659" dur="6.11">occur now they&amp;#39;re telling us that the</text>
  <text start="519.8" dur="6.64">manufacturing PMI has increased but net</text>
  <text start="522.769" dur="6.161">new export orders employment they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="526.44" dur="4.41">declining so part of this really doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="528.93" dur="4.67">make sense and this is what we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="530.85" dur="5.79">see we&amp;#39;re gonna see some data that is</text>
  <text start="533.6" dur="6.429">starting to break away that things are</text>
  <text start="536.64" dur="5.639">falling apart other data will be</text>
  <text start="540.029" dur="4.351">manipulated but eventually what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="542.279" dur="4.081">to happen we&amp;#39;ll see more and more of</text>
  <text start="544.38" dur="3.81">these statistical information well</text>
  <text start="546.36" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;re just gonna start letting it go</text>
  <text start="548.19" dur="3.74">they&amp;#39;re gonna they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="549.66" dur="6.119">manipulate it the way they&amp;#39;ve been and</text>
  <text start="551.93" dur="5.2">this is a signal an indicator to let you</text>
  <text start="555.779" dur="5.281">know that things are starting to rapidly</text>
  <text start="557.13" dur="7.49">fall apart we see the global bond market</text>
  <text start="561.06" dur="6.389">has lost about 1.7 trillion in November</text>
  <text start="564.62" dur="5.98">this is the worst monthly meltdown on</text>

  <text start="570.6" dur="4.71">have accelerated their war on cash and</text>
  <text start="573.36" dur="5.01">we can see what&amp;#39;s happening in India</text>
  <text start="575.31" dur="6.33">right now where they demonetised</text>
  <text start="578.37" dur="4.86">the rupee and people are now hurting but</text>
  <text start="581.64" dur="4.58">we have other instances</text>
  <text start="583.23" dur="5.76">is that show that the government is</text>
  <text start="586.22" dur="5.31">waging the war on and I should say the</text>
  <text start="588.99" dur="6.87">central bankers are waging the war on</text>

  <text start="626.01" dur="6.15">and they&amp;#39;re telling us that the reason</text>
  <text start="627.75" dur="7.08">for all of this is because we need to</text>

  <text start="639.06" dur="4.23">you do a little bit of a research you</text>
