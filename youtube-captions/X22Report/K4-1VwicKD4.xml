  <text start="104.59" dur="3.6">the US we&amp;#39;ve been looking at many</text>
  <text start="106.119" dur="4.681">different economic indicators like</text>
  <text start="108.19" dur="5.97">automobiles but looking at housing</text>
  <text start="110.8" dur="5.25">looking at retail and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="114.16" dur="5.01">is a complete breakdown of the entire</text>
  <text start="116.05" dur="6.629">system now this is happening in other</text>
  <text start="119.17" dur="7.05">countries we see there was an undercover</text>
  <text start="122.679" dur="6.781">investigation out in Europe where these</text>
  <text start="126.22" dur="5.37">European auto lenders well they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="129.46" dur="3.66">the same thing that is happening here in</text>
  <text start="131.59" dur="3.54">the United States just like in the</text>
  <text start="133.12" dur="4.29">United States where anyone that has a</text>
  <text start="135.13" dur="4.98">pulse they can get a loan for a car and</text>
  <text start="137.41" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;ve lowered the qualifications for</text>
  <text start="140.11" dur="4.23">those people getting the loans down</text>
  <text start="141.79" dur="4.71">below subprime it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter</text>
  <text start="144.34" dur="4.08">and we know already that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="146.5" dur="5.16">changing the credit scores to bring in</text>
  <text start="148.42" dur="6.96">more people now out in Europe what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="151.66" dur="6.57">seeing is that they are saying listen no</text>
  <text start="155.38" dur="6.51">cash upfront you don&amp;#39;t even have to have</text>
  <text start="158.23" dur="7.79">a job and you can drive off the lot</text>
  <text start="161.89" dur="7.41">with a car with absolutely nothing and</text>
  <text start="166.02" dur="6.22">what&amp;#39;s happening is these individuals</text>
  <text start="169.3" dur="5.19">well they can&amp;#39;t make the payments and if</text>
  <text start="172.24" dur="5.91">they can&amp;#39;t make the payments the cars</text>
  <text start="174.49" dur="5.49">are automatically repossessed with no</text>
  <text start="178.15" dur="3.81">questions or anything like that they</text>
  <text start="179.98" dur="5.04">just come and they take the car and the</text>
  <text start="181.96" dur="4.99">customers well they have to pay back</text>
  <text start="185.02" dur="5.59">hundreds of pounds</text>
  <text start="186.95" dur="5.73">month for years so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="190.61" dur="3.15">that is the same thing that is happening</text>
  <text start="192.68" dur="3.93">here in the United States it is</text>
  <text start="193.76" dur="5.97">happening out in Europe and the reason</text>
  <text start="196.61" dur="7.409">for this is because the entire global</text>
  <text start="199.73" dur="6">economic system is breaking down and we</text>
  <text start="204.019" dur="5.22">can see out in many different areas like</text>
  <text start="205.73" dur="6.18">Canada the UK the housing market is also</text>
  <text start="209.239" dur="4.86">breaking down and now in the UK there</text>
  <text start="211.91" dur="6.06">are two leading economists and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="214.099" dur="7.551">warning of a property crash they said we</text>
  <text start="217.97" dur="6.989">are due for a significant correction in</text>
  <text start="221.65" dur="6.25">housing prices they&amp;#39;re saying we might</text>
  <text start="224.959" dur="5.851">see something where we might see a 40 to</text>
  <text start="227.9" dur="6.48">50 percent correction in the housing</text>
  <text start="230.81" dur="7.95">market over 1 million mortgages are</text>
  <text start="234.38" dur="6.63">under threat in the UK and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="238.76" dur="4.65">seeing is that this is not the only</text>
  <text start="241.01" dur="4.08">place this is happening we see it out</text>
  <text start="243.41" dur="3.93">here in the United States we see in</text>
  <text start="245.09" dur="4.649">Canada we see it out in the UK like we</text>
  <text start="247.34" dur="5.989">just discussed we also see it throughout</text>
  <text start="249.739" dur="6.571">Europe in Spain in Italy in Greece</text>
  <text start="253.329" dur="4.9">because what is happening here all this</text>
  <text start="256.31" dur="4.709">debt everything that&amp;#39;s been pushed into</text>
  <text start="258.229" dur="5.701">this this gigantic illusion of these</text>
  <text start="261.019" dur="5.191">debt bubbles where everyone thinks</text>
  <text start="263.93" dur="5.82">everything is fine well everything is</text>
  <text start="266.21" dur="6.78">about to crash the party is almost over</text>
  <text start="269.75" dur="7.01">here and we are seeing a lot of economic</text>
  <text start="272.99" dur="6.69">indicators that are pointing towards a</text>
  <text start="276.76" dur="4.18">recession and from everything that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="279.68" dur="3.9">discussed and everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="280.94" dur="5.88">saying we are already in a recession now</text>
  <text start="283.58" dur="5.19">the government right now the Fed they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="286.82" dur="3.569">not going to admit to this until much</text>
  <text start="288.77" dur="4.41">much later they&amp;#39;re going to go backwards</text>
  <text start="290.389" dur="5.28">in time and say oh by the way the</text>
  <text start="293.18" dur="5.459">recession started in the mid year of</text>
  <text start="295.669" dur="4.531">2016 we didn&amp;#39;t realize it back then</text>
  <text start="298.639" dur="4.021">because everything looked fantastic but</text>
  <text start="300.2" dur="4.95">when we went back in time well then we</text>
  <text start="302.66" dur="4.59">saw where it really started and how it</text>
  <text start="305.15" dur="3.51">all unfolded but we&amp;#39;ve been tracking</text>
  <text start="307.25" dur="3.99">this for quite a while they did this</text>
  <text start="308.66" dur="4.77">back in 2008 where they went back in</text>
  <text start="311.24" dur="4.049">time and said well it really started way</text>
  <text start="313.43" dur="4.169">before the crash of the stock market and</text>
  <text start="315.289" dur="5.251">this is when it always starts way before</text>
  <text start="317.599" dur="7.171">this now city their cities centum</text>
  <text start="320.54" dur="5.91">indicator well this crashed and when you</text>
  <text start="324.77" dur="5.19">look at this you can see that their</text>
  <text start="326.45" dur="6.35">surprise index well this is also crashed</text>
  <text start="329.96" dur="5.67">we are receiving so many economic</text>
  <text start="332.8" dur="6.34">indicators letting us know that things</text>
  <text start="335.63" dur="5.4">are rapidly falling apart and Bank of</text>
  <text start="339.14" dur="4.77">America is out there saying well it</text>
  <text start="341.03" dur="6.21">looks like from our analysis the bull</text>
  <text start="343.91" dur="5.94">market is over and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="347.24" dur="6.3">right now the stock market is immaterial</text>
  <text start="349.85" dur="6.87">because the real economy is continually</text>
  <text start="353.54" dur="5.55">breaking down there&amp;#39;s no stopping it as</text>
  <text start="356.72" dur="3.45">we can see when everyone said no retail</text>
  <text start="359.09" dur="3.45">is going to be fine</text>
  <text start="360.17" dur="5.01">housing is strong we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="362.54" dur="4.62">cracks everywhere and these cracks are</text>
  <text start="365.18" dur="4.65">getting bigger they&amp;#39;re getting larger</text>
  <text start="367.16" dur="4.47">and before you know it the entire system</text>
  <text start="369.83" dur="3.75">is falling apart the stock market&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="371.63" dur="3.69">coming down and everyone all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="373.58" dur="2.67">realizes hey wait a minute we have a</text>
  <text start="375.32" dur="4.14">problem here</text>
  <text start="376.25" dur="5.43">the economy is not doing well and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="379.46" dur="4.2">when everyone wakes up that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="381.68" dur="3.63">everyone starts getting nervous this is</text>
  <text start="383.66" dur="3.72">when corporations say you know something</text>
  <text start="385.31" dur="4.44">this is the signal where we can start</text>
  <text start="387.38" dur="5.79">letting go a lot of people starting we</text>
  <text start="389.75" dur="5.94">could start to cut everything we have an</text>
  <text start="393.17" dur="5.04">excuse and this is what they&amp;#39;ve done in</text>
  <text start="395.69" dur="5.07">the past and this is what people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="398.21" dur="5.79">understand they&amp;#39;re going to do it again</text>
  <text start="400.76" dur="6.72">and we&amp;#39;re going to see waves and mass</text>
  <text start="404" dur="5.22">waves of layoffs that are going to hit</text>
  <text start="407.48" dur="4.41">each one of these companies and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="409.22" dur="6.45">going to be a lot of people out of work</text>
  <text start="411.89" dur="5.43">I mean think about it from 2008 to the</text>
  <text start="415.67" dur="4.77">present time they told us that all these</text>
  <text start="417.32" dur="7.29">jobs well we&amp;#39;ve been accruing them</text>
  <text start="420.44" dur="6.9">through retail through food and service</text>
  <text start="424.61" dur="5.4">where there&amp;#39;s bartenders waiters well if</text>
  <text start="427.34" dur="7.32">we have about 8,000 to 10,000 stores</text>
  <text start="430.01" dur="7.11">closing where all these jobs then the</text>
  <text start="434.66" dur="5.94">whole thing doesn&amp;#39;t make sense so who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="437.12" dur="6.35">getting the jobs now if all these stores</text>
  <text start="440.6" dur="5.58">are closing we sing them go bankrupt and</text>
  <text start="443.47" dur="4.99">everything is shutting down where are</text>
  <text start="446.18" dur="4.05">all the jobs if the restaurant</text>
  <text start="448.46" dur="4.26">Performance Index is continually</text>
  <text start="450.23" dur="4.23">dropping and restaurants are now in</text>
  <text start="452.72" dur="4.289">trouble</text>
  <text start="454.46" dur="6.12">where are the people going to get work</text>
  <text start="457.009" dur="5.851">well we&amp;#39;ve run out of places and this is</text>
  <text start="460.58" dur="5.309">why we&amp;#39;re seeing a collapse of the</text>
  <text start="462.86" dur="5.459">entire system right now it&amp;#39;s all falling</text>
  <text start="465.889" dur="3.93">apart yes the corporate media and the</text>
  <text start="468.319" dur="3.6">Fed they&amp;#39;re pretending that everything</text>
  <text start="469.819" dur="5.13">is fine this is all part of the Act they</text>
  <text start="471.919" dur="4.47">did it prior to 2008 they convinced us</text>
  <text start="474.949" dur="3.81">that everything was fine until the very</text>
  <text start="476.389" dur="3.691">very end and then of course they tried</text>
  <text start="478.759" dur="3.541">to blame it on the people it&amp;#39;s all those</text>
  <text start="480.08" dur="3.899">people that took out mortgages all the</text>
  <text start="482.3" dur="4.049">people that bought homes that weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="483.979" dur="5.19">really qualified to do this it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="486.349" dur="4.35">your fault that this happened no it was</text>
  <text start="489.169" dur="4.921">the government it was the central bank</text>
  <text start="490.699" dur="6.211">it was the way they created the system</text>
  <text start="494.09" dur="6.99">the system doesn&amp;#39;t work for the people</text>
  <text start="496.91" dur="8.18">the system works for them it takes the</text>
  <text start="501.08" dur="6.78">wealth and it pushes it up to them</text>
  <text start="505.09" dur="6.759">they&amp;#39;ve been stealing our wealth for a</text>
  <text start="507.86" dur="8.15">very long time now we see North Korea</text>
  <text start="511.849" dur="7.711">well they fired their first ever ICBM</text>
  <text start="516.01" dur="5.5">missile system and of course the</text>
  <text start="519.56" dur="4.71">corporate media is going crazy over this</text>
  <text start="521.51" dur="4.53">and there of course they want us to</text>
  <text start="524.27" dur="3.33">attack because remember the corporate</text>
  <text start="526.04" dur="4.109">media is part of the deep state it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="527.6" dur="4.56">deep state mouthpiece and they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="530.149" dur="4.761">there saying yes this is the time we</text>
  <text start="532.16" dur="5.429">need to act we need to do something well</text>
  <text start="534.91" dur="4.72">think about this for a second they</text>
  <text start="537.589" dur="3.511">tested a ballistic missile they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="539.63" dur="2.72">testing missiles for a very very long</text>
  <text start="541.1" dur="3.87">time</text>
  <text start="542.35" dur="9.4">other countries test missiles Russia</text>
  <text start="544.97" dur="9.059">China Turkey United States and do we</text>
  <text start="551.75" dur="5.31">attack these countries no just because a</text>
  <text start="554.029" dur="7.171">country tests a missile it doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="557.06" dur="5.46">it&amp;#39;s time for war and this missile and</text>
  <text start="561.2" dur="4.199">this is coming from the US Pacific</text>
  <text start="562.52" dur="4.02">Command confirm the test and said it was</text>
  <text start="565.399" dur="3.331">a land-based</text>
  <text start="566.54" dur="3.93">intermediate-range missile that flew for</text>
  <text start="568.73" dur="4.799">about 37 minutes before splashing down</text>
  <text start="570.47" dur="5.7">on the Sea of Japan and we could see</text>
  <text start="573.529" dur="5.25">right now Trump is out there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="576.17" dur="4.83">telling China telling Japan telling</text>
  <text start="578.779" dur="3.93">Russia we need to talk about this we</text>
  <text start="581" dur="4.14">need to come together we need to have</text>
  <text start="582.709" dur="5.251">dialogue on the situation but what is</text>
  <text start="585.14" dur="5.97">happening here is the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="587.96" dur="5.19">trying to push the agenda of we need to</text>
  <text start="591.11" dur="4.86">go into North Korea because this missile</text>
  <text start="593.15" dur="5.28">now can hit Alaska it can fly and hit</text>
  <text start="595.97" dur="5.73">other areas and we are not safe</text>
  <text start="598.43" dur="5.25">well again North Korea for them to</text>
  <text start="601.7" dur="5.04">attack the United States it would be a</text>
  <text start="603.68" dur="4.77">complete disaster and they know this</text>
  <text start="606.74" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re not going to do it actually</text>
  <text start="608.45" dur="4.26">Trump was tweeting out there and he</text>
  <text start="611" dur="3">tweeted North Korea has just launched</text>
  <text start="612.71" dur="4.08">another missile does this guy have</text>
  <text start="614" dur="5.33">anything better to do with his life hard</text>
  <text start="616.79" dur="4.65">to believe that South Korea and Japan</text>
  <text start="619.33" dur="4.6">will put up with this much longer</text>
  <text start="621.44" dur="5.13">perhaps China will put a heavy move on</text>
  <text start="623.93" dur="5.04">North Korea and end this nonsense once</text>
  <text start="626.57" dur="5.1">and for all now he didn&amp;#39;t mention war he</text>
  <text start="628.97" dur="4.5">mentioned redline because what is</text>
  <text start="631.67" dur="4.38">happening here is they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="633.47" dur="5.49">behind the scenes have a dialogue with</text>
  <text start="636.05" dur="6.18">North Korea they&amp;#39;re talking about peace</text>
  <text start="638.96" dur="6.12">about calming the situation down and we</text>
  <text start="642.23" dur="5.04">can see during this next meeting the g20</text>
  <text start="645.08" dur="5.55">meeting we know that Zhi Jing ping and</text>
  <text start="647.27" dur="5.04">Putin and Trump and many other leaders</text>
  <text start="650.63" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re going to be talking about North</text>
  <text start="652.31" dur="4.26">Korea and we see right now that Putin</text>
  <text start="655.07" dur="3.57">announced that he would coordinate with</text>
  <text start="656.57" dur="3.96">Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to</text>
  <text start="658.64" dur="4.77">promote their plan to work with North</text>
  <text start="660.53" dur="4.68">Korea we&amp;#39;ve agreed to robustly promote</text>
  <text start="663.41" dur="6.6">our joint initiative to find a solution</text>
  <text start="665.21" dur="7.26">to the Korean issue and we have a</text>
  <text start="670.01" dur="5.49">step-by-step program that we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="672.47" dur="7.35">try to implement now we need to</text>
  <text start="675.5" dur="6.75">understand why does the deep state want</text>
  <text start="679.82" dur="5.37">North Korea why are they so concerned</text>
  <text start="682.25" dur="5.63">about North Korea well one they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="685.19" dur="4.98">selling opium they&amp;#39;re in direct</text>
  <text start="687.88" dur="4.54">competition with the CIA the</text>
  <text start="690.17" dur="3.78">intelligence agencies not just here in</text>
  <text start="692.42" dur="4.89">the United States but around the world</text>
  <text start="693.95" dur="5.79">and they don&amp;#39;t like competition because</text>
  <text start="697.31" dur="4.82">it&amp;#39;s competition with them selling opium</text>
  <text start="699.74" dur="5.19">from Afghanistan in many other places</text>
  <text start="702.13" dur="5.68">also North Korea is a strategic location</text>
  <text start="704.93" dur="4.92">to hit China it would be great to have</text>
  <text start="707.81" dur="5.25">this area because they can place</text>
  <text start="709.85" dur="7.22">missiles in North Korea we also found</text>
  <text start="713.06" dur="8.06">out that North Korea has an estimated</text>
  <text start="717.07" dur="8.97">sixth to 10 trillion dollars in</text>
  <text start="721.12" dur="6.78">Minerals beneath its surface now among</text>
  <text start="726.04" dur="6.71">the 200 minerals buried beneath the</text>
  <text start="727.9" dur="8.27">madness country our iron gold</text>
  <text start="732.75" dur="4.89">magnesite zinc copper limestone and</text>
  <text start="736.17" dur="4.59">graphite</text>
  <text start="737.64" dur="5.92">what are these minerals used for</text>
  <text start="740.76" dur="5.86">technology high-tech products like</text>
  <text start="743.56" dur="6.06">smartphones computer system military</text>
  <text start="746.62" dur="6.21">equipment and we see there&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="749.62" dur="6.09">another agenda it&amp;#39;s not about their</text>
  <text start="752.83" dur="6.12">missile systems it&amp;#39;s not about the</text>
  <text start="755.71" dur="6.84">country itself it&amp;#39;s what they have and</text>
  <text start="758.95" dur="6.389">they&amp;#39;ve been using their missile test</text>
  <text start="762.55" dur="5.31">system their nuclear program to make</text>
  <text start="765.339" dur="4.471">everyone worried and afraid about what</text>
  <text start="767.86" dur="3.96">North Korea is doing well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="769.81" dur="3.96">worried and afraid because once they</text>
  <text start="771.82" dur="4.35">become a full-fledged nuclear power and</text>
  <text start="773.77" dur="4.259">they have the ability to place a nuclear</text>
  <text start="776.17" dur="4.59">weapon on top of their missile system it</text>
  <text start="778.029" dur="4.681">makes it very very difficult to go into</text>
  <text start="780.76" dur="4.019">those cut to that country and have</text>
  <text start="782.71" dur="3.36">regime change this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="784.779" dur="4.941">trying to do and they&amp;#39;re fighting</text>
  <text start="786.07" dur="7.86">against time right now now we see that</text>
  <text start="789.72" dur="7.09">out in Syria the deep state those</text>
  <text start="793.93" dur="5.61">terrorist groups within Syria they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="796.81" dur="5.88">using the propaganda that chlorine gas</text>
  <text start="799.54" dur="5.43">was used once again in Syria and Syria</text>
  <text start="802.69" dur="3.839">has come out and they&amp;#39;re saying and this</text>
  <text start="804.97" dur="3.72">is coming from the Syrian Deputy Foreign</text>
  <text start="806.529" dur="4.321">Minister saying listen the United States</text>
  <text start="808.69" dur="3.57">signed off on it Russia signed off on it</text>
  <text start="810.85" dur="3.51">the UN signed off on it</text>
  <text start="812.26" dur="4.5">we had inspections inside of our country</text>
  <text start="814.36" dur="4.86">there is no longer any chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="816.76" dur="4.62">in Syria or any toxic chemical materials</text>
  <text start="819.22" dur="6.39">or gases that could be used in military</text>
  <text start="821.38" dur="6.87">operations now Russia came out and</text>
  <text start="825.61" dur="4.61">they&amp;#39;re saying that the Western media it</text>
  <text start="828.25" dur="5.31">what they&amp;#39;re putting on a chemical shell</text>
  <text start="830.22" dur="5.59">fueled by careful crafted messages that</text>
  <text start="833.56" dur="3.66">pin the blame on Damascus for the</text>
  <text start="835.81" dur="3.09">alleged use of chemical weapons and this</text>
  <text start="837.22" dur="4.02">is the chlorine gas that&amp;#39;s being used in</text>
  <text start="838.9" dur="4.53">Damascus now of course the moderate</text>
  <text start="841.24" dur="3.87">rebels the terrorist groups are saying</text>
  <text start="843.43" dur="3.36">that the Syrian government are using</text>
  <text start="845.11" dur="4.71">chemical weapons now remember the</text>
  <text start="846.79" dur="5.91">terrorist groups are reporting this when</text>
  <text start="849.82" dur="4.26">the OPCW went in they didn&amp;#39;t inspect the</text>
  <text start="852.7" dur="2.91">area they</text>
  <text start="854.08" dur="3.48">just believe whatever the terrorist</text>
  <text start="855.61" dur="6.3">groups told them and that&amp;#39;s what they</text>
  <text start="857.56" dur="6.99">used to decide what happened in Syria</text>
  <text start="861.91" dur="8.37">there was no investigation whatsoever</text>
  <text start="864.55" dur="7.14">and Maria Zakharova is out there from</text>
  <text start="870.28" dur="4.32">Russia saying that the statement</text>
  <text start="871.69" dur="5.1">produced on behalf of the FSA is nothing</text>
  <text start="874.6" dur="4.29">more than a testament of the official</text>
  <text start="876.79" dur="3.63">disinformation campaign which has</text>
  <text start="878.89" dur="3.81">already been launched against the</text>
  <text start="880.42" dur="4.59">government and saying they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="882.7" dur="5.34">this as hard as they possibly can now</text>
  <text start="885.01" dur="6.18">once again we are seeing the deep state</text>
  <text start="888.04" dur="5.34">pushing their agenda very very hard to</text>
  <text start="891.19" dur="5.58">convince the world that Syria is using</text>
  <text start="893.38" dur="6.15">chemical weapons once again and we see</text>
  <text start="896.77" dur="5.67">at this point this is what the 30th the</text>
  <text start="899.53" dur="6.71">40th time that they tried this it is not</text>
  <text start="902.44" dur="6.72">gaining any type of traction whatsoever</text>
  <text start="906.24" dur="5.44">everything always fizzles out because</text>
  <text start="909.16" dur="5.37">once the experts get in there once the</text>
  <text start="911.68" dur="5.01">investigation starts to happen guess</text>
  <text start="914.53" dur="4.8">what happens the propaganda story</text>
  <text start="916.69" dur="5.43">completely falls apart it does this</text>
  <text start="919.33" dur="4.68">every single time and they only have a</text>
  <text start="922.12" dur="4.86">small window to push their propaganda</text>
  <text start="924.01" dur="7.17">and already it&amp;#39;s starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="926.98" dur="5.97">no one is believing this anymore and you</text>
  <text start="931.18" dur="4.64">can see this is their last act they have</text>
  <text start="932.95" dur="5.07">nothing left what else do they say</text>
  <text start="935.82" dur="4.03">because what is happening here is the</text>
  <text start="938.02" dur="5.99">terrorist groups they are losing ground</text>
  <text start="939.85" dur="7.55">in Syria they&amp;#39;re obliterated in Iraq</text>
  <text start="944.01" dur="5.89">Libya has been pushing them out and</text>
  <text start="947.4" dur="4.81">we&amp;#39;re starting to see that the Islamic</text>
  <text start="949.9" dur="5.75">state this once powerful terrorist group</text>
  <text start="952.21" dur="6.21">is disappearing now and this is the paid</text>
  <text start="955.65" dur="5.56">mercenary army of the Intelligence</text>
  <text start="958.42" dur="4.35">Agency and you know the clock is ticking</text>
  <text start="961.21" dur="4.05">down they only have a certain amount of</text>
  <text start="962.77" dur="4.41">time and you can see that they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="965.26" dur="3.99">to push war using the corporate media</text>
  <text start="967.18" dur="3.81">trying to make everyone believe that oh</text>
  <text start="969.25" dur="3.96">this is a terrible thing and they keep</text>
  <text start="970.99" dur="5.54">going back and forth Syria North Korea</text>
  <text start="973.21" dur="6.27">Syria North Korea and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="976.53" dur="6.69">push something they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="979.48" dur="7.76">the world into war and on the other side</text>
  <text start="983.22" dur="6.84">we see that China we</text>
  <text start="987.24" dur="5.099">Russia and now Trump with his</text>
  <text start="990.06" dur="5.279">administration they&amp;#39;re trying to defuse</text>
  <text start="992.339" dur="5.431">the situation they don&amp;#39;t want to have</text>
  <text start="995.339" dur="5.491">war and this has been proven over time</text>
  <text start="997.77" dur="6.18">where China and Russia have continually</text>
  <text start="1000.83" dur="5.34">said let&amp;#39;s talk about this and we can</text>
  <text start="1003.95" dur="5.43">see with Trump now there are no red</text>
  <text start="1006.17" dur="4.979">lines there are no absolutes he wants</text>
  <text start="1009.38" dur="4.59">China he wants Russia he wants a</text>
  <text start="1011.149" dur="7.171">dialogue and we see that this is being</text>
  <text start="1013.97" dur="6.57">pushed now out in North Korea and we can</text>
  <text start="1018.32" dur="5.04">see that Russia well though the</text>
  <text start="1020.54" dur="4.86">determine the fate of Assad because the</text>
  <text start="1023.36" dur="5.49">United States mission is just to get the</text>
  <text start="1025.4" dur="6.029">Islamic state and that&amp;#39;s that and I have</text>
  <text start="1028.85" dur="6.15">a funny feeling that when all said and</text>
  <text start="1031.429" dur="5.551">done Trump is going to say okay we</text>
  <text start="1035" dur="3.329">completed our mission there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="1036.98" dur="4.56">for the United States to be in there yes</text>
  <text start="1038.329" dur="4.591">there are certain rogue individuals that</text>
  <text start="1041.54" dur="4.23">are saying that we&amp;#39;re going to stay in</text>
  <text start="1042.92" dur="5.61">Iraq we&amp;#39;re going to stay in Syria but I</text>
  <text start="1045.77" dur="4.53">think as time goes on that is going to</text>
  <text start="1048.53" dur="4.89">be questioned because what we see right</text>
  <text start="1050.3" dur="6.12">now the deep state they&amp;#39;re losing ground</text>
  <text start="1053.42" dur="5.1">everywhere the walls are surrounding and</text>
  <text start="1056.42" dur="7.65">closing in on them does that mean they</text>
  <text start="1058.52" dur="8.64">are done no it means that they might do</text>
  <text start="1064.07" dur="6.27">something because when all else fails</text>
