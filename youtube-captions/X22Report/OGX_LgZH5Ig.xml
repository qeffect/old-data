  <text start="69.6" dur="3.81">yesterday Trump had a news conference</text>
  <text start="72" dur="3.75">and there were many things that were</text>
  <text start="73.41" dur="5.49">said about the media and things like</text>
  <text start="75.75" dur="5.79">that but something very interesting that</text>
  <text start="78.9" dur="7.2">he came out and said is that the economy</text>
  <text start="81.54" dur="8.969">is a mess now think about this for a</text>
  <text start="86.1" dur="6.81">second the economy is a mess just a day</text>
  <text start="90.509" dur="5.551">before we had Janet Yellen out there</text>
  <text start="92.91" dur="5.459">saying that the economy is disappointing</text>
  <text start="96.06" dur="4.65">it is getting weaker and then she came</text>
  <text start="98.369" dur="4.231">out with the phrase and you will you</text>
  <text start="100.71" dur="5.4">don&amp;#39;t blame the Fed if things start to</text>

  <text start="106.11" dur="5.25">together we&amp;#39;re starting to see what is</text>
  <text start="108.509" dur="6.301">going on here we had Mario Draghi saying</text>
  <text start="111.36" dur="6.149">if Trump puts his policies forward his</text>
  <text start="114.81" dur="6.059">economic policies and the economy starts</text>
  <text start="117.509" dur="6.03">to deteriorate well that&amp;#39;s because of</text>

  <text start="123.539" dur="6.481">same thing christine lagarde and what</text>
  <text start="126.36" dur="5.79">we&amp;#39;re starting to see right now is the</text>
  <text start="130.02" dur="4.62">truth is starting to come out the</text>
  <text start="132.15" dur="4.77">illusion that we&amp;#39;ve been under for such</text>
  <text start="134.64" dur="5.25">a long time is starting to break away</text>
  <text start="136.92" dur="4.92">and we are seeing that the economy is</text>
  <text start="139.89" dur="4.59">not what they&amp;#39;ve been telling us</text>
  <text start="141.84" dur="4.95">remember the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="144.48" dur="4.86">governments of central banks around the</text>
  <text start="146.79" dur="5.279">world they&amp;#39;re not working in the best</text>
  <text start="149.34" dur="5.13">interest of the people they are working</text>
  <text start="152.069" dur="6.78">in the best interest to their masters</text>
  <text start="154.47" dur="7.019">and what we&amp;#39;ve been tracking is the</text>
  <text start="158.849" dur="6.151">lead-up well actually it is the collapse</text>
  <text start="161.489" dur="5.341">scenario because all behind all the</text>
  <text start="165" dur="4.2">scenes behind all the headlines of the</text>
  <text start="166.83" dur="6.23">corporate media behind the stock market</text>

  <text start="204.739" dur="4.051">believed that the economy was doing well</text>
  <text start="206.78" dur="4.049">they believed the central bank when they</text>
  <text start="208.79" dur="4.589">said we&amp;#39;re not forecasting recession</text>

  <text start="225.799" dur="5.66">are these as strong as they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="229.219" dur="7.41">us and when they looked inside they saw</text>

  <text start="323.75" dur="5.49">happening right now is we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="325.97" dur="6.449">down a period of time where the truth is</text>
  <text start="329.24" dur="6.51">coming out the illusion is disappearing</text>
  <text start="332.419" dur="7.741">and for some they&amp;#39;ve been living this</text>
  <text start="335.75" dur="6.78">economic nightmare for years and just</text>
  <text start="340.16" dur="5.28">because they&amp;#39;re working at a part-time</text>
  <text start="342.53" dur="5.58">job doesn&amp;#39;t mean that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="345.44" dur="5.849">with them because at one time until you</text>
  <text start="348.11" dur="5.1">experience it at one time where maybe</text>
  <text start="351.289" dur="4.621">they had this great full-time job and</text>
  <text start="353.21" dur="4.11">they couldn&amp;#39;t find a full-time job so</text>
  <text start="355.91" dur="2.879">they had to take one or two part-time</text>
  <text start="357.32" dur="3.599">jobs they lost our house they lost their</text>

  <text start="364.58" dur="7.05">different type of nightmare compared to</text>
  <text start="367.25" dur="7.83">a person who cannot find work at all so</text>
  <text start="371.63" dur="6.259">people are all at different levels what</text>
  <text start="375.08" dur="7.95">Obama did during this period of time is</text>
  <text start="377.889" dur="8.441">he gave people government money money so</text>
  <text start="383.03" dur="6.15">they wouldn&amp;#39;t complain about what was</text>

  <text start="400.639" dur="7.77">word or guess what that flow of money</text>
  <text start="404.919" dur="6.131">stops now what the central bankers want</text>
  <text start="408.409" dur="5.341">to do is they want to start universal</text>
  <text start="411.05" dur="5.85">basic income why do they want to do this</text>
  <text start="413.75" dur="5.4">if the economy is so strong why do they</text>
  <text start="416.9" dur="6.269">want to give money to everyone to</text>
  <text start="419.15" dur="6">control them to keep them quiet so they</text>
  <text start="423.169" dur="5.481">can keep going on with what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="425.15" dur="6.09">doing but what&amp;#39;s happening right now is</text>
  <text start="428.65" dur="4.57">things are rapidly falling apart look at</text>
  <text start="431.24" dur="4.02">the UK now everyone&amp;#39;s saying oh because</text>
  <text start="433.22" dur="4.169">of the brexit the UK is doing</text>

  <text start="443.419" dur="4.651">they haven&amp;#39;t done anything yet and what</text>
  <text start="445.52" dur="3.8">we&amp;#39;re seeing out in the UK is things are</text>
  <text start="448.07" dur="4.83">breaking down</text>
  <text start="449.32" dur="6.129">UK retail sales they fell for a third</text>
  <text start="452.9" dur="5.7">month in January and what they&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="455.449" dur="6.631">right now is inflation volume of goods</text>
  <text start="458.6" dur="7.379">sold in stores and online declined by</text>

  <text start="473.15" dur="4.799">inflation hit we&amp;#39;re seeing inflation</text>
  <text start="475.19" dur="6.27">here in the United States and this is</text>
  <text start="477.949" dur="6.891">why families individuals are having a</text>
  <text start="481.46" dur="5.94">very rough time surviving right now</text>
  <text start="484.84" dur="5.17">because when the cost of living Rises</text>
  <text start="487.4" dur="5.91">faster than your paycheck year after</text>
  <text start="490.01" dur="5.4">year or the or the cost of living Rises</text>
  <text start="493.31" dur="4.169">faster than what the the government is</text>
  <text start="495.41" dur="4.259">giving you you have problems people on</text>
  <text start="497.479" dur="5.401">food stamps as the prices of food</text>
  <text start="499.669" dur="5.881">continually rise their food stamp money</text>
  <text start="502.88" dur="5.819">stays the same that doesn&amp;#39;t increase</text>
  <text start="505.55" dur="4.56">with it until the government votes and</text>
  <text start="508.699" dur="4.791">says okay this is we&amp;#39;re going to give</text>
  <text start="510.11" dur="7.38">you a more but most of the time it is</text>
  <text start="513.49" dur="5.469">basically at one level and if you are</text>
  <text start="517.49" dur="4.89">buying let&amp;#39;s say this package of cookies</text>
  <text start="518.959" dur="5.671">or meat or whatever it is at a certain</text>
  <text start="522.38" dur="4.709">amount and it just gone up to three four</text>
  <text start="524.63" dur="5.43">five dollars well guess what you have to</text>
  <text start="527.089" dur="6.75">purchase less now and they&amp;#39;re finding it</text>
  <text start="530.06" dur="7.77">very difficult to survive and since</text>
  <text start="533.839" dur="5.731">nineteen thirteen the US dollar has lost</text>
  <text start="537.83" dur="4.5">more than ninety eight percent of its</text>
  <text start="539.57" dur="4.44">value now if our paychecks were</text>
  <text start="542.33" dur="5.28">increasing the faster than inflation</text>
  <text start="544.01" dur="5.34">this wouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem now in the</text>
  <text start="547.61" dur="4.05">beginning of the system back in 1971</text>
  <text start="549.35" dur="4.02">when inflation hit because what happened</text>
  <text start="551.66" dur="4.74">was we came off the gold standard there</text>
  <text start="553.37" dur="7.11">was a lot of dollars out in circulation</text>
  <text start="556.4" dur="6.33">and we had this huge amount of inflation</text>
  <text start="560.48" dur="5.549">interest rates were very high they</text>
  <text start="562.73" dur="6.24">readjusted wages we&amp;#39;re at the end stage</text>
  <text start="566.029" dur="6.481">of the system right now that&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="568.97" dur="7.02">to work and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="572.51" dur="8.37">we&amp;#39;re seeing a price increases on food</text>
  <text start="575.99" dur="6.42">margarine up 63.6 percent uncooked</text>
  <text start="580.88" dur="3.53">ground beef up</text>
  <text start="582.41" dur="5.64">forty six point three percent</text>
  <text start="584.41" dur="6.549">prescription drugs up 43.5 percent rice</text>
  <text start="588.05" dur="5.19">pasta cornmeal up forty percent bread up</text>
  <text start="590.959" dur="6.531">thirty-eight percent what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="593.24" dur="7.279">is we&amp;#39;re seeing inflation hit right now</text>
  <text start="597.49" dur="5.38">the other thing we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="600.519" dur="4.661">Americans they&amp;#39;re not really refinancing</text>
  <text start="602.87" dur="4.949">their homes like they used to it has</text>
  <text start="605.18" dur="4.32">fallen to the lowest level since 2009</text>
  <text start="607.819" dur="3.69">now a lot of people refinance their</text>
  <text start="609.5" dur="3.689">homes they took the money and they use</text>
  <text start="611.509" dur="4.741">that money today we&amp;#39;re not saying this</text>
  <text start="613.189" dur="4.861">and if you remember we also saw a</text>
  <text start="616.25" dur="3.87">slowdown a mortgage refinancing just</text>
  <text start="618.05" dur="5.579">before the great financial crisis of</text>
  <text start="620.12" dur="5.55">2008 and we can see that mortgage</text>
  <text start="623.629" dur="4.26">applications overall well they&amp;#39;re down</text>
  <text start="625.67" dur="5.55">thirty one percent from where they were</text>
  <text start="627.889" dur="6.541">a year ago that tells you something now</text>
  <text start="631.22" dur="5.21">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking auto sales and we</text>
  <text start="634.43" dur="4.199">can see right now that vulnerable</text>
  <text start="636.43" dur="4.86">automobile manufacturers they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="638.629" dur="4.741">channel stuffing a lot of the lots and</text>
  <text start="641.29" dur="4.599">remember when they channel stuff a lot</text>
  <text start="643.37" dur="4.68">that is considered a sale not when you</text>
  <text start="645.889" dur="4.44">sell it to an individual but when the</text>
  <text start="648.05" dur="4.979">dealership receives the automobile and</text>
  <text start="650.329" dur="4.56">we can see with the low interest rates</text>
  <text start="653.029" dur="4.381">and perpetual loosening of auto lending</text>
  <text start="654.889" dur="4.741">standards we see that a lot of people</text>
  <text start="657.41" dur="4.229">went in and they purchase their cars</text>
  <text start="659.63" dur="4.59">they traded in their old leases they got</text>
  <text start="661.639" dur="6.361">a little bit better cars more expensive</text>
  <text start="664.22" dur="6.27">and with rates on the rise right now and</text>
  <text start="668" dur="6.209">a flood of lease returns driving down</text>
  <text start="670.49" dur="5.82">used car prices which pushed auto sales</text>
  <text start="674.209" dur="4.44">to record highs over the past several</text>
  <text start="676.31" dur="5.19">months well it looks like things are now</text>
  <text start="678.649" dur="4.951">changing course now in the past we</text>
  <text start="681.5" dur="4.079">talked about delinquencies and what</text>
  <text start="683.6" dur="6.78">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="685.579" dur="7.26">rise in delinquencies and delinquency</text>
  <text start="690.38" dur="8.699">rates they&amp;#39;re soaring to the highest</text>
  <text start="692.839" dur="8.341">level since 2009 2010 looking at gm7</text>
  <text start="699.079" dur="5.13">private data going back to two thousand</text>

  <text start="706.639" dur="4.981">decent indicator that all is not well</text>
  <text start="709.25" dur="7.309">and when we look at this we can see</text>
  <text start="711.62" dur="8.209">starting in July of 2012</text>
  <text start="716.559" dur="7.421">well 61 plus State delinquency rates</text>
  <text start="719.829" dur="8.11">they have lasted longer than they did in</text>
  <text start="723.98" dur="5.639">the Great Recession and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="727.939" dur="4.32">seeing from the Financial Times which</text>
  <text start="729.619" dur="4.08">pointed out it&amp;#39;s not just subprime</text>

  <text start="749.839" dur="6.901">fourth quarter of 2016 so we are headed</text>
  <text start="753.41" dur="5.549">into a complete disaster and what funny</text>
  <text start="756.74" dur="6.629">thing about this is this is what we saw</text>
  <text start="758.959" dur="6.66">to the lead up to two thousand eight so</text>
  <text start="763.369" dur="5.97">we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of the same exact</text>
  <text start="765.619" dur="7.47">things which means things are not better</text>
  <text start="769.339" dur="5.85">at all now another indicator that shows</text>
  <text start="773.089" dur="6.331">that we&amp;#39;re on the same exact path of</text>
  <text start="775.189" dur="6.93">2008 is that total u.s. household debt</text>
  <text start="779.42" dur="4.32">jumped in the fourth quarter now this</text>
  <text start="782.119" dur="6.241">was driven by the increase of credit</text>
  <text start="783.74" dur="7.379">card debt auto and student loans which</text>
  <text start="788.36" dur="5.599">is very interesting and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="791.119" dur="6.9">seeing right now is that debt level it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="793.959" dur="7.84">almost as high as it was in 2008</text>
  <text start="798.019" dur="6.81">actually after this quarter most likely</text>
  <text start="801.799" dur="5.431">will be at the same exact level that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="804.829" dur="5.401">how fast it&amp;#39;s rising because people are</text>
  <text start="807.23" dur="6.079">using credit to survive people been</text>
  <text start="810.23" dur="6.449">sucked into the auto loan market and</text>
  <text start="813.309" dur="6.58">purchase new cars they brought in</text>
  <text start="816.679" dur="7.65">subprime people you have to remember how</text>
  <text start="819.889" dur="7.74">the central bankers work they need more</text>
  <text start="824.329" dur="5.07">and more debt out there that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="827.629" dur="4.231">love it this is why the corporate media</text>
  <text start="829.399" dur="6.18">reports on it when they say wow debt is</text>
  <text start="831.86" dur="6.24">rising fast auto sales are incredible</text>
  <text start="835.579" dur="6.961">because people don&amp;#39;t buy cars with cash</text>
  <text start="838.1" dur="7.76">anymore it&amp;#39;s all loans people don&amp;#39;t buy</text>
  <text start="842.54" dur="5.759">homes with cash anymore it&amp;#39;s all loans</text>

  <text start="856.4" dur="6.27">going on it&amp;#39;s great for them bad for the</text>
  <text start="859.85" dur="6.06">economy and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="862.67" dur="6.21">is that things are rapidly falling apart</text>
  <text start="865.91" dur="6.33">and remember the US government admitted</text>
  <text start="868.88" dur="5.61">to fabricating student loan default data</text>
  <text start="872.24" dur="3.93">so it&amp;#39;s a lot worse than they were even</text>

  <text start="897.89" dur="8.82">this recovery we&amp;#39;re not it is a complete</text>
  <text start="901.04" dur="9.09">illusion now out in kirkuk Stan we see</text>
  <text start="906.71" dur="6.45">the central bank governor out there they</text>

  <text start="937.55" dur="4.38">this except here in the United States</text>
