  <text start="116.66" dur="5.67">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="118.909" dur="6.21">political ng a political news now as we</text>
  <text start="122.33" dur="4.71">can see Obamacare is it is in a complete</text>
  <text start="125.119" dur="3.87">dense pile now this is not something</text>
  <text start="127.04" dur="3.27">that just started those people have been</text>
  <text start="128.989" dur="3">following me we&amp;#39;ve been following this</text>
  <text start="130.31" dur="3.899">for quite a while we&amp;#39;ve seen exchanges</text>
  <text start="131.989" dur="4.291">closed down we&amp;#39;ve seen billions and</text>
  <text start="134.209" dur="4.201">billions of dollars lost we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="136.28" dur="3.75">looking at the enrollments and we know</text>
  <text start="138.41" dur="3.48">that there&amp;#39;s a lot of people that say</text>
  <text start="140.03" dur="4.56">listen I just can&amp;#39;t afford this I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="141.89" dur="3.99">make enough I can&amp;#39;t get the subsidies so</text>
  <text start="144.59" dur="4.739">I&amp;#39;m going to have to take the penalty</text>
  <text start="145.88" dur="7.26">actually in 2016 six point five million</text>
  <text start="149.329" dur="5.071">people paid the fine instead of taking</text>
  <text start="153.14" dur="3.33">the insurance and this is according to</text>
  <text start="154.4" dur="4.11">the IRS and what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="156.47" dur="4.859">about this is that we continually see</text>
  <text start="158.51" dur="5.25">premiums move up now the number of</text>
  <text start="161.329" dur="6.261">insurance companies participating is in</text>
  <text start="163.76" dur="6.6">is on track to shrink by 38% in 2018 and</text>
  <text start="167.59" dur="5.35">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="170.36" dur="4.469">we&amp;#39;re seeing more and more individual</text>
  <text start="172.94" dur="4.95">say you know something I&amp;#39;m going to have</text>
  <text start="174.829" dur="4.321">to opt out and the reason for this is</text>
  <text start="177.89" dur="2.34">because when we look at all the</text>
  <text start="179.15" dur="3.21">different insurance companies we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="180.23" dur="4.259">seeing you know rate hikes anywhere</text>
  <text start="182.36" dur="4.19">between twenty and fifty percent they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="184.489" dur="5.751">continually moving up and up and up</text>
  <text start="186.55" dur="6.39">this is causing a huge problem and rates</text>
  <text start="190.24" dur="4.59">have actually soared on average of about</text>
  <text start="192.94" dur="3.21">a hundred and thirteen percent over the</text>
  <text start="194.83" dur="5.9">past four years and nearly thirty</text>
  <text start="196.15" dur="7.74">percent per year so as this continually</text>
  <text start="200.73" dur="5.68">happens more and more people as they</text>
  <text start="203.89" dur="5.55">lose their job as they find a part-time</text>
  <text start="206.41" dur="5.13">job instead of a full-time job they just</text>
  <text start="209.44" dur="4.56">can&amp;#39;t make ends meet now when we look at</text>
  <text start="211.54" dur="3.63">the people with subsidies well that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="214" dur="3.51">little bit of a different story because</text>
  <text start="215.17" dur="5.43">remember the government is stepping in</text>
  <text start="217.51" dur="4.86">and paying for the insurance so it makes</text>
  <text start="220.6" dur="4.47">a little bit easier but when you look at</text>
  <text start="222.37" dur="5.01">the private sector where they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="225.07" dur="3.99">getting the subsidies and I really</text>
  <text start="227.38" dur="4.35">should say the upper-class</text>
  <text start="229.06" dur="5.79">where they don&amp;#39;t meet that criteria they</text>
  <text start="231.73" dur="4.74">can&amp;#39;t afford it and they keep talking</text>
  <text start="234.85" dur="3.18">about all these individuals that have</text>
  <text start="236.47" dur="3">who are getting the subsidies and</text>
  <text start="238.03" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re talking about those individuals</text>
  <text start="239.47" dur="3.63">who are saying that yes they need this</text>
  <text start="241.48" dur="3.15">they want this but again it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="243.1" dur="3.63">government paying for all of this</text>
  <text start="244.63" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re not out there taking the money</text>
  <text start="246.73" dur="3.15">from their own pockets and paying for</text>
  <text start="248.8" dur="3.48">this they&amp;#39;re getting these subsidies</text>
  <text start="249.88" dur="5.63">compared to six point five million</text>
  <text start="252.28" dur="5.82">people who have to say okay can I afford</text>
  <text start="255.51" dur="6.01">1800 dollars a month and most of the</text>
  <text start="258.1" dur="5.52">people are saying no I cannot and again</text>
  <text start="261.52" dur="3.48">this all depends on you know how many</text>
  <text start="263.62" dur="3.29">people are in your family what plan you</text>
  <text start="265" dur="5.64">take but we can see that many people</text>
  <text start="266.91" dur="6.7">that&amp;#39;s where the average range is now</text>
  <text start="270.64" dur="5.67">there&amp;#39;s a want group out there called</text>
  <text start="273.61" dur="5.67">fact and this is the foundation for</text>
  <text start="276.31" dur="4.14">accountability and civic trust they are</text>
  <text start="279.28" dur="3.48">going to file a complaint with the</text>
  <text start="280.45" dur="4.5">Federal Election Commission alleging</text>
  <text start="282.76" dur="4.89">that the DNC violated federal law by</text>
  <text start="284.95" dur="4.38">soliciting opposition research on the</text>
  <text start="287.65" dur="5.6">Trump campaign from a foreign government</text>
  <text start="289.33" dur="6.93">now we&amp;#39;ve heard this before this is a</text>
  <text start="293.25" dur="7.14">foreign government this entity which is</text>
  <text start="296.26" dur="7.53">Ukraine now what happened here is that</text>
  <text start="300.39" dur="6.58">this political operative Alexandra</text>
  <text start="303.79" dur="7.26">chalupa in her capacity as a DNC</text>
  <text start="306.97" dur="6.03">consultant so intelligence on Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="311.05" dur="4.58">former campaign chairman Paul Mann</text>
  <text start="313" dur="5.1">afford from Ukrainian officials now</text>
  <text start="315.63" dur="4.509">federal law and Commission regulations</text>
  <text start="318.1" dur="4.23">prohibit any person from</text>
  <text start="320.139" dur="4.53">knowingly soliciting accepting or</text>
  <text start="322.33" dur="4.709">receiving contributions or donations of</text>
  <text start="324.669" dur="5.761">money or other things of value from a</text>
  <text start="327.039" dur="5.731">foreign national now fact alleges that</text>
  <text start="330.43" dur="4.949">chalupa violated the ban by knowingly</text>
  <text start="332.77" dur="4.56">soliciting a valuable in-kind</text>
  <text start="335.379" dur="4.831">contribution in the form of opposition</text>
  <text start="337.33" dur="4.919">research and information on a Trump</text>
  <text start="340.21" dur="4.44">campaign official from a foreign</text>
  <text start="342.249" dur="5.341">national on behalf of the Democratic</text>
  <text start="344.65" dur="4.62">National Committee now remember the DNC</text>
  <text start="347.59" dur="3.329">they&amp;#39;re saying that no no she was a</text>
  <text start="349.27" dur="4.29">consultant she really wasn&amp;#39;t part of the</text>
  <text start="350.919" dur="5.4">DNC but we can see that again the DNC</text>
  <text start="353.56" dur="5.21">was accepting this information and she</text>
  <text start="356.319" dur="6.391">received this from a foreign government</text>
  <text start="358.77" dur="6.609">now Robert Mueller who is the special</text>
  <text start="362.71" dur="4.979">counsel to look into the Russian</text>
  <text start="365.379" dur="4.141">collusion well it looks like his</text>
  <text start="367.689" dur="6.241">finances are being called into question</text>
  <text start="369.52" dur="7.59">because his finances are kind of swampy</text>
  <text start="373.93" dur="5.13">and when we look at his law firm he</text>
  <text start="377.11" dur="4.019">handled clients like Facebook and we</text>
  <text start="379.06" dur="4.139">know that Mark Zuckerberg he is no fan</text>
  <text start="381.129" dur="4.021">of the president Mueller was also paid</text>
  <text start="383.199" dur="6.03">handsomely for a speech by a Mexican</text>
  <text start="385.15" dur="7.919">bank Banamex and we see that there is</text>
  <text start="389.229" dur="6.12">many other different firms different</text>
  <text start="393.069" dur="4.62">countries that he&amp;#39;s dealing with and</text>
  <text start="395.349" dur="5.88">many of these individuals they are no</text>
  <text start="397.689" dur="6.271">fan of the President and we can see that</text>
  <text start="401.229" dur="6.291">Mueller right now well he might be</text>
  <text start="403.96" dur="6.569">crossing the line because his entire</text>
  <text start="407.52" dur="7.179">investigation is moving from Russian</text>
  <text start="410.529" dur="6.211">collusion into financial crimes and</text>
  <text start="414.699" dur="3.84">looking into Trump&amp;#39;s financial crimes</text>
  <text start="416.74" dur="3.51">and it looks like we&amp;#39;re almost getting</text>
  <text start="418.539" dur="2.791">to the point where they&amp;#39;re going to say</text>
  <text start="420.25" dur="3.539">okay wait a minute</text>
  <text start="421.33" dur="5.699">have you found anything with the Russian</text>
  <text start="423.789" dur="5.701">collusion if not your time right now is</text>
  <text start="427.029" dur="4.91">up you can&amp;#39;t go in any other direction</text>
  <text start="429.49" dur="5.76">that is not what you were put here for</text>
  <text start="431.939" dur="5.051">but again we know that the Russian</text>
  <text start="435.25" dur="4.349">collusion whole thing that whole story</text>
  <text start="436.99" dur="4.47">is completely fake phony and false we</text>
  <text start="439.599" dur="3.81">know what they&amp;#39;re trying to do they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="441.46" dur="3.81">trying to figure out a way to get them</text>
  <text start="443.409" dur="4.111">any way they possibly can and this is</text>
  <text start="445.27" dur="4.079">why they need to move out of the realm</text>
  <text start="447.52" dur="3.8">of the Russian collusion and look at</text>
  <text start="449.349" dur="4.311">other things</text>
  <text start="451.32" dur="4.8">we see that Trump has thanked Putin for</text>
  <text start="453.66" dur="5.01">slashing the u.s. embassy staff he says</text>
  <text start="456.12" dur="3.9">it cuts our payroll this is really like</text>
  <text start="458.67" dur="3.83">a joke and I think what this whole thing</text>
  <text start="460.02" dur="3.93">was it was completely planned I mean</text>
  <text start="462.5" dur="4.24">think about it</text>
  <text start="463.95" dur="4.92">Obama closed the compound here in the</text>
  <text start="466.74" dur="4.2">United States removed some of the</text>
  <text start="468.87" dur="3.42">Russian officials Russia turned around</text>
  <text start="470.94" dur="2.4">and said okay let&amp;#39;s remove these</text>
  <text start="472.29" dur="4.95">individuals and I think what they were</text>
  <text start="473.34" dur="5.4">doing is they were removing individuals</text>
  <text start="477.24" dur="2.94">that were part of the deep state and</text>
  <text start="478.74" dur="4.59">what Trump was out there really saying</text>
  <text start="480.18" dur="6.53">is thank you for removing them from</text>
  <text start="483.33" dur="6.39">Russia now all over the corporate media</text>
  <text start="486.71" dur="7.54">we can see they are playing up this</text>
  <text start="489.72" dur="5.61">North Korea nuclear war like we&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="494.25" dur="5.16">seen before</text>
  <text start="495.33" dur="7.08">and of course north korea has denounced</text>
  <text start="499.41" dur="5.34">trump&amp;#39;s fire and fury threat in a</text>
  <text start="502.41" dur="4.17">massive rally and they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="504.75" dur="4.83">it look like you know something&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="506.58" dur="3.78">going to happen now to bring this to the</text>
  <text start="509.58" dur="2.49">next level</text>
  <text start="510.36" dur="4.02">the corporate media is out there</text>
  <text start="512.07" dur="4.71">fear-mongering and we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="514.38" dur="4.56">before we&amp;#39;ve seen it with Iraq we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="516.78" dur="5.639">seen it with Libya we&amp;#39;ve seen it with</text>
  <text start="518.94" dur="5.4">Syria and this is how we know this is</text>
  <text start="522.419" dur="5.521">what the deep state does think about it</text>
  <text start="524.34" dur="6.69">what month are we in right now we are in</text>
  <text start="527.94" dur="6.74">the month of August when does the deep</text>
  <text start="531.03" dur="6.51">state like to play go back to 2013</text>
  <text start="534.68" dur="6.13">well the sarin gas sarin gas attack in</text>
  <text start="537.54" dur="5.55">Syria occurred in August why in August</text>
  <text start="540.81" dur="3.72">this is when Congress goes on vacation</text>
  <text start="543.09" dur="3.02">this time they were there a little bit</text>
  <text start="544.53" dur="5.49">longer because of the whole Obama</text>
  <text start="546.11" dur="8.25">Obamacare repeal but what we&amp;#39;ve seen in</text>
  <text start="550.02" dur="7.41">the past if we look at 2014 2015 2016</text>
  <text start="554.36" dur="6.1">something always happens during this</text>
  <text start="557.43" dur="6.45">period of time we see that Japan they</text>
  <text start="560.46" dur="5.37">have deployed Patriot missile systems to</text>
  <text start="563.88" dur="3.24">shoot down North Korean rockets now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="565.83" dur="3.48">going to tell you right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="567.12" dur="4.41">going to be no rockets heading towards</text>
  <text start="569.31" dur="4.05">Japan this whole thing is to make it</text>
  <text start="571.53" dur="4.2">look really good and the corporate media</text>
  <text start="573.36" dur="3.84">well they&amp;#39;re just building this up like</text>
  <text start="575.73" dur="3.63">there&amp;#39;s no tomorrow now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="577.2" dur="4.29">interesting about this is that the North</text>
  <text start="579.36" dur="4.17">Korean media they announced that the</text>
  <text start="581.49" dur="3.3">leadership is finalizing plans for</text>
  <text start="583.53" dur="2.31">hitting Guam</text>
  <text start="584.79" dur="2.52">and they&amp;#39;re going to use their</text>
  <text start="585.84" dur="3.6">intermediate range missiles which are</text>
  <text start="587.31" dur="5.34">apparently to be launched in when oh</text>
  <text start="589.44" dur="5.34">that&amp;#39;s right mid August why again mid</text>
  <text start="592.65" dur="4.8">August because this is when the deep</text>
  <text start="594.78" dur="6.48">state plays now do you really think</text>
  <text start="597.45" dur="5.7">North Korea is going to hit Guam with</text>
  <text start="601.26" dur="3.99">their medium-range missile now if you</text>
  <text start="603.15" dur="3.84">notice they&amp;#39;re specifically saying</text>
  <text start="605.25" dur="3.45">medium-range missiles because they</text>
  <text start="606.99" dur="3.48">really don&amp;#39;t have an intercontinental</text>
  <text start="608.7" dur="3.9">ballistic missile we discussed this</text>
  <text start="610.47" dur="4.14">before that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re saying this</text>
  <text start="612.6" dur="4.83">now let&amp;#39;s think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="614.61" dur="4.92">North Korea came out they broadcasted</text>
  <text start="617.43" dur="5.07">all over the world that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="619.53" dur="5.85">be firing and you know intermediate</text>
  <text start="622.5" dur="6.21">missile intermediate medium-range</text>
  <text start="625.38" dur="7.55">missile at Guam so they&amp;#39;re telling the</text>
  <text start="628.71" dur="7.88">United States what they&amp;#39;re about to do</text>
  <text start="632.93" dur="7.63">why would they do this at this point</text>
  <text start="636.59" dur="6.61">then the United States Trump comes out</text>

  <text start="643.2" dur="7.8">and said we have a plan already set up</text>
  <text start="646.88" dur="6.73">to go into North Korea if they actually</text>
  <text start="651" dur="7.86">do fire these missiles we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="653.61" dur="9.21">use b-1b b-1b Lancer bombers and they</text>

  <text start="662.82" dur="4.29">broadcasting everything that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="665.19" dur="3.12">be done does this make any sense</text>
  <text start="667.11" dur="4.05">whatsoever</text>
  <text start="668.31" dur="5.34">if you&amp;#39;re truly going to do something</text>

  <text start="690.78" dur="7.53">Alaska those are completely fake phony</text>

  <text start="698.31" dur="4.94">strike on North Korean missile sites</text>
  <text start="699.9" dur="6.33">with bombers stationed in Guam is</text>
  <text start="703.25" dur="4.81">absolutely ridiculous on the US part</text>

  <text start="708.06" dur="6.96">exactly what they&amp;#39;re going to do so this</text>
  <text start="712.17" dur="5.49">whole thing doesn&amp;#39;t make sense at all</text>
  <text start="715.02" dur="6.45">this is propaganda that</text>

  <text start="779.9" dur="8.95">so is North Korea really going to attack</text>
  <text start="783.96" dur="9.93">Guam no North Korea they will not nuke</text>
  <text start="788.85" dur="7.44">the u.s. territory of Guam why well</text>

  <text start="818.31" dur="4.68">first of all do they have a nuclear</text>
  <text start="821.25" dur="4.29">device that they can place on a missile</text>
  <text start="822.99" dur="8.94">yes we&amp;#39;ve heard the propaganda but guess</text>
  <text start="825.54" dur="9.33">what do we have proof hard evidence no</text>

  <text start="844.44" dur="4.649">nuclear weapons as a deterrent this is</text>
  <text start="846.87" dur="4.54">why he continually is out there saying</text>

  <text start="851.41" dur="2.669">and we know what he&amp;#39;s talking about he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="852.669" dur="4.02">talking about regime change in his</text>

  <text start="856.689" dur="6.54">work before he is going to protect the</text>
  <text start="860.739" dur="3.93">country so he&amp;#39;s not crazy a lot of</text>
  <text start="863.229" dur="3">people think is the corporate media has</text>
  <text start="864.669" dur="3.96">made him out to be crazy just like they</text>

  <text start="875.559" dur="5.58">crazy and we need to get rid of him so</text>
  <text start="878.709" dur="4.44">when we look at this we can see that all</text>

  <text start="925.029" dur="4.56">Japan came out with this ridiculous 500</text>

  <text start="931.929" dur="5.73">they have this nuclear weapon again this</text>
  <text start="934.689" dur="7.77">was all speculation it was created</text>
  <text start="937.659" dur="7.04">without any proof whatsoever so right</text>
  <text start="942.459" dur="4.35">now we&amp;#39;re dealing with guesswork and</text>
  <text start="944.699" dur="5.68">speculation there&amp;#39;s no hard evidence</text>
  <text start="946.809" dur="6.84">about anything so when we really look at</text>
  <text start="950.379" dur="6.6">this and we see what&amp;#39;s happening we need</text>
  <text start="953.649" dur="4.951">to think to ourselves what is the deep</text>

  <text start="958.6" dur="4.739">create a war and what do we have to look</text>

  <text start="963.339" dur="5.52">going to do North Korea is going to do</text>

  <text start="992.41" dur="7.08">Beijing voted in favor of the sanctions</text>

  <text start="1030.059" dur="3.241">one of the reasons there&amp;#39;s many others</text>
  <text start="1031.62" dur="4.14">but we can see this is what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>

  <text start="1035.76" dur="4.949">the idea this propaganda story and</text>
  <text start="1038.76" dur="5.549">they&amp;#39;re building the narrative and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1040.709" dur="6.331">amazing how they picked August why</text>
  <text start="1044.309" dur="6.901">didn&amp;#39;t they pick June why didn&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="1047.04" dur="8.16">pick April why not after Labor Day they</text>
  <text start="1051.21" dur="8.49">always pick August it&amp;#39;s the same pattern</text>
  <text start="1055.2" dur="7.59">and a couple reports ago I said from now</text>
  <text start="1059.7" dur="6.66">until Labor Day they are going to push</text>
  <text start="1062.79" dur="6.87">this as hard as they possibly can to get</text>
  <text start="1066.36" dur="6.12">something started now we can see that a</text>
