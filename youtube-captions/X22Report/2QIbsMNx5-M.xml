  <text start="169.99" dur="6.27">economic collapse financial news now we</text>
  <text start="172.9" dur="5.7">know the central bankers their product</text>
  <text start="176.26" dur="5.49">is debt and they got to keep pushing</text>
  <text start="178.6" dur="5.88">dead out because otherwise their system</text>
  <text start="181.75" dur="4.89">fails and there always comes a point</text>
  <text start="184.48" dur="4.29">where they can&amp;#39;t push any more debt out</text>
  <text start="186.64" dur="4.35">and the whole thing just comes falling</text>
  <text start="188.77" dur="5.28">apart that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="190.99" dur="5.07">and if we go back in time we can see</text>
  <text start="194.05" dur="4.56">what the central bankers have done over</text>
  <text start="196.06" dur="5.46">time where they manipulated everything</text>
  <text start="198.61" dur="6.66">to make it possible for people to</text>
  <text start="201.52" dur="6.99">purchase a car purchase a house get an</text>
  <text start="205.27" dur="5.49">education and what they&amp;#39;ve done was they</text>
  <text start="208.51" dur="5.31">started off with you know you purchased</text>
  <text start="210.76" dur="5.1">a house with maybe cash maybe you only</text>
  <text start="213.82" dur="4.59">took out a 15 year mortgage you</text>
  <text start="215.86" dur="5.19">purchased a car with cash maybe then it</text>
  <text start="218.41" dur="4.71">went into financing for three years or</text>
  <text start="221.05" dur="5.159">four years and then eventually what</text>
  <text start="223.12" dur="6.3">happened was to purchase that car you</text>
  <text start="226.209" dur="6.301">had to finance it now for sixty or</text>
  <text start="229.42" dur="6.15">seventy two months then as time went on</text>
  <text start="232.51" dur="6.35">to purchase that car you had to lease it</text>
  <text start="235.57" dur="7.02">because basically that&amp;#39;s renting that</text>
  <text start="238.86" dur="6.69">automobile because the value of the</text>
  <text start="242.59" dur="5">dollar continually decreased which means</text>
  <text start="245.55" dur="4.27">everything got a lot more expensive</text>
  <text start="247.59" dur="5.59">which means your dollar doesn&amp;#39;t go that</text>
  <text start="249.82" dur="7.44">far so in order to you to afford any of</text>
  <text start="253.18" dur="7.26">this stuff you had to take out a bigger</text>
  <text start="257.26" dur="5.28">and bigger loan and once that dried up</text>
  <text start="260.44" dur="3.69">same thing with housing and education</text>
  <text start="262.54" dur="3.45">you know people used to go to college</text>
  <text start="264.13" dur="4.08">and they used to work a part-time job</text>
  <text start="265.99" dur="5.52">and pay for college now if you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="268.21" dur="4.98">to a school and it costs you know twenty</text>
  <text start="271.51" dur="3.42">thousand year thirty thousand year forty</text>
  <text start="273.19" dur="4.08">thousand a year it&amp;#39;s very difficult to</text>
  <text start="274.93" dur="4.17">do so and you have to take out loans and</text>
  <text start="277.27" dur="4.02">more loans and before you know it all</text>
  <text start="279.1" dur="4.89">you have is loans and the job that you</text>
  <text start="281.29" dur="4.62">get can&amp;#39;t pay for the payments on the</text>
  <text start="283.99" dur="6.21">loans so the government had to come in</text>
  <text start="285.91" dur="7.41">and readjust how you pay them back they</text>
  <text start="290.2" dur="8.31">adjusted it to your income lengthen the</text>
  <text start="293.32" dur="9.05">time frame now after all of that and all</text>
  <text start="298.51" dur="6.69">those people were in the loan market</text>
  <text start="302.37" dur="5.32">they ran out of people so then they went</text>
  <text start="305.2" dur="5.55">this subprime and they went to the sub</text>
  <text start="307.69" dur="7.47">subprime and they&amp;#39;ve run out of people</text>
  <text start="310.75" dur="7.06">again so what do you do you do what the</text>
  <text start="315.16" dur="5.56">central bankers do best</text>
  <text start="317.81" dur="6.99">you recalculate everything to allow</text>
  <text start="320.72" dur="6.72">people to take out more loans now the</text>
  <text start="324.8" dur="4.56">creator of the FICO score the most</text>
  <text start="327.44" dur="4.38">common measure of Americans credit</text>
  <text start="329.36" dur="5.61">rating they are going to roll out a new</text>
  <text start="331.82" dur="5.64">scoring system in 2019 that takes into</text>
  <text start="334.97" dur="5.19">account how consumers manage their bank</text>
  <text start="337.46" dur="5.61">accounts in order to specifically try to</text>
  <text start="340.16" dur="5.31">boost credit scores it&amp;#39;s a large shift</text>
  <text start="343.07" dur="3.96">for the FICO score and will be one of</text>
  <text start="345.47" dur="5.759">the biggest changes to the system since</text>
  <text start="347.03" dur="6.21">the 90s the new score is going to be</text>
  <text start="351.229" dur="3.361">called the ultra FICO and is being</text>
  <text start="353.24" dur="4.14">designed specifically to boost the</text>
  <text start="354.59" dur="6.12">number of approvals for credit cards and</text>
  <text start="357.38" dur="6.65">loans yes they need to put you into more</text>
  <text start="360.71" dur="6.51">debt this is what this is about</text>
  <text start="364.03" dur="4.78">so the calculation for the new score has</text>
  <text start="367.22" dur="3.48">been in the works for years they knew</text>
  <text start="368.81" dur="4.14">this was coming they already had it</text>
  <text start="370.7" dur="5.13">planned because they know their system</text>
  <text start="372.95" dur="4.08">dies and people you know they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="375.83" dur="3.93">afford anything once the dollar</text>
  <text start="377.03" dur="4.59">continually decreases in value you run</text>
  <text start="379.76" dur="3.39">up your credit cards maybe you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="381.62" dur="4.2">delinquent on certain things you lose</text>
  <text start="383.15" dur="4.56">your job what do you do well you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="385.82" dur="4.77">take out any more loans this is why the</text>
  <text start="387.71" dur="5.43">car industry went to sub subprime and</text>
  <text start="390.59" dur="5.67">anyone with a heartbeat so now they</text>
  <text start="393.14" dur="4.62">changed everything so anybody with an</text>
  <text start="396.26" dur="3.27">average balance of four hundred ollars</text>
  <text start="397.76" dur="4.11">in their bank accounts without in</text>
  <text start="399.53" dur="4.949">overdraft history over the last three</text>
  <text start="401.87" dur="5.46">months they are going to get a boost in</text>
  <text start="404.479" dur="4.621">their score now FICO thinks that about</text>
  <text start="407.33" dur="3.45">seven million potential applicants will</text>
  <text start="409.1" dur="3.81">be affected by the new calculation and</text>
  <text start="410.78" dur="4.44">new system twenty six million</text>
  <text start="412.91" dur="5.819">subprime borrowers could wind up with</text>
  <text start="415.22" dur="5.16">higher credit scores as a result which</text>
  <text start="418.729" dur="4.981">will allow them to get into the credit</text>
  <text start="420.38" dur="5.55">card increase their ceiling and what</text>
  <text start="423.71" dur="5.519">they could borrow they can go out and</text>
  <text start="425.93" dur="6.51">purchase maybe a better car take out</text>
  <text start="429.229" dur="4.471">more of a loan and we can see they</text>
  <text start="432.44" dur="4.289">needed to do this</text>
  <text start="433.7" dur="5.55">to keep their system operational this is</text>
  <text start="436.729" dur="3.601">the endgame this is what happens I mean</text>
  <text start="439.25" dur="4.62">think about what they did with real</text>
  <text start="440.33" dur="4.83">estate automobile when with real estate</text>
  <text start="443.87" dur="3.75">they were like okay</text>
  <text start="445.16" dur="4.29">you needed a 20% down payment check your</text>
  <text start="447.62" dur="4.05">credit score and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="449.45" dur="3.84">went down to 15% 10% 3%</text>
  <text start="451.67" dur="3.3">percent down with the automobile</text>
  <text start="453.29" dur="4.14">industry why do you think they started</text>
  <text start="454.97" dur="4.29">out with good credit risks then they</text>
  <text start="457.43" dur="3.63">went to subprime sub subprime anyone</text>
  <text start="459.26" dur="4.62">with a heart beat it&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="461.06" dur="6.66">running out of individuals that meet</text>
  <text start="463.88" dur="6.69">those requirements and to keep the</text>
  <text start="467.72" dur="4.32">industry chugging along they have to</text>
  <text start="470.57" dur="2.79">keep doing this and they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="472.04" dur="3.63">this for a very long time but you can</text>
  <text start="473.36" dur="6.72">see right now this means we&amp;#39;re at the</text>
  <text start="475.67" dur="6.12">end stage now very interestingly the SEC</text>
  <text start="480.08" dur="4.2">is coming out with a warning and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="481.79" dur="5.01">been talking about how the pension</text>
  <text start="484.28" dur="5.6">system state local federal they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="486.8" dur="6.54">pretty much underfunded by 40% or more</text>
  <text start="489.88" dur="6.25">now what has happened here is the SEC</text>
  <text start="493.34" dur="5.03">Commissioner warns that a retirement</text>
  <text start="496.13" dur="5.31">crisis tsunami is approaching</text>
  <text start="498.37" dur="5.98">commissioner Cara M Stein spoke to</text>
  <text start="501.44" dur="4.32">Brookings Institution on Tuesday giving</text>
  <text start="504.35" dur="3.6">a talk titled</text>
  <text start="505.76" dur="5.61">the new American Dream retirement</text>
  <text start="507.95" dur="5.64">security and this is what she said since</text>

  <text start="519.35" dur="4.74">sufficient income for their golden years</text>
  <text start="521.08" dur="5.29">due to a number of factors the financial</text>
  <text start="524.09" dur="6">health of Social Security trust fund has</text>
  <text start="526.37" dur="5.4">been declining we move from a collective</text>
  <text start="530.09" dur="4.59">retirement system to one in which each</text>
  <text start="531.77" dur="5.7">person is expected to go it alone the</text>
  <text start="534.68" dur="5.43">retirement crisis is a tsunami that is</text>
  <text start="537.47" dur="4.71">rapidly approaching we can already see</text>
  <text start="540.11" dur="4.44">it and indeed we are starting to feel</text>
  <text start="542.18" dur="4.56">its effect Americans are having to work</text>
  <text start="544.55" dur="3.84">past traditional retirement age and the</text>
  <text start="546.74" dur="4.05">number of bankruptcies for those over</text>
  <text start="548.39" dur="5.31">the age of 65 has increased dramatically</text>
  <text start="550.79" dur="5.22">the size and speed of the tsunami is</text>
  <text start="553.7" dur="5.7">likely to increase as it gets closer and</text>
  <text start="556.01" dur="5.22">closer to us our population is aging and</text>
  <text start="559.4" dur="3.75">the cost of medic medical care an</text>
  <text start="561.23" dur="3.9">important factor for retirees is</text>
  <text start="563.15" dur="4.02">increasing we must address these</text>
  <text start="565.13" dur="6.54">problems before we are collectively</text>
  <text start="567.17" dur="6.72">underwater now remember we see these</text>
  <text start="571.67" dur="5.64">pension plans like the Dallas Pension</text>
  <text start="573.89" dur="5.4">Fund the CalPERS pension fund the</text>
  <text start="577.31" dur="5.61">pension fund in Detroit the Dallas</text>
  <text start="579.29" dur="5.97">police pension fund and many others they</text>
  <text start="582.92" dur="4.02">are struggling and most of them</text>
  <text start="585.26" dur="5.31">have projected that they would get</text>
  <text start="586.94" dur="5.37">returns on 8% 7% and what they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="590.57" dur="4.38">is they&amp;#39;ve hooked themselves to the</text>
  <text start="592.31" dur="7.5">stock market this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="594.95" dur="6.93">complete and utter disaster and as we</text>
  <text start="599.81" dur="4.86">move forward it&amp;#39;s just going to get</text>
  <text start="601.88" dur="4.35">worse and when everyone says well this</text>
  <text start="604.67" dur="3.72">time it&amp;#39;s going to be different it is</text>
  <text start="606.23" dur="4.68">going to be different the difference is</text>
  <text start="608.39" dur="5.25">is that the economy is going to be</text>
  <text start="610.91" dur="6.15">brought down by the central bank and</text>
  <text start="613.64" dur="6.75">blamed on the central bank so we can do</text>
  <text start="617.06" dur="5.91">away with the private central bank that</text>
  <text start="620.39" dur="4.28">is going to be the big difference this</text>
  <text start="622.97" dur="4.65">time because we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="624.67" dur="4.96">Trump is planning along with all those</text>
  <text start="627.62" dur="5.4">people that are working behind him with</text>
  <text start="629.63" dur="5.79">the narrative of how the Fed brought the</text>
  <text start="633.02" dur="4.83">economy down he&amp;#39;s laying the bread comes</text>
  <text start="635.42" dur="3.78">with contradicting the Fed telling that</text>
  <text start="637.85" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s not a good idea to raise interest</text>
  <text start="639.2" dur="6.57">rates the Fed is his biggest threat</text>
  <text start="642.62" dur="5.55">right now and we&amp;#39;re already seeing signs</text>
  <text start="645.77" dur="5.34">that the economy is rapidly falling</text>
  <text start="648.17" dur="5.67">apart and we&amp;#39;ve already seen from Fed</text>
  <text start="651.11" dur="4.83">Kaplan that if we continually raise</text>
  <text start="653.84" dur="6.36">rates we&amp;#39;re going to hit this sometime</text>
  <text start="655.94" dur="6.24">in June of 2019 now that is the top part</text>
  <text start="660.2" dur="3.87">of when we hit it now they might go a</text>
  <text start="662.18" dur="3.33">little bit over it and then eventually</text>
  <text start="664.07" dur="3.18">once they see everything starting to</text>
  <text start="665.51" dur="4.01">fall apart and am I talking about the</text>
  <text start="667.25" dur="4.29">statistical numbers of the stock market</text>

  <text start="671.54" dur="4.47">numbers up</text>
  <text start="672.23" dur="8.61">but everything else retail people having</text>
  <text start="676.01" dur="9.63">jobs corporate profits things like that</text>
  <text start="680.84" dur="7.2">the banking institutions they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="685.64" dur="6.3">going to start to fall apart I mean</text>
  <text start="688.04" dur="6.72">think about 2008 July August September</text>
  <text start="691.94" dur="4.35">the market it was around 14,000 points</text>
  <text start="694.76" dur="2.7">it really wasn&amp;#39;t moving anywhere is up</text>
  <text start="696.29" dur="4.44">and down a little bit here and there</text>
  <text start="697.46" dur="5.07">real estate they said is fine it&amp;#39;s okay</text>
  <text start="700.73" dur="3.84">don&amp;#39;t worry about it but even though in</text>
  <text start="702.53" dur="4.31">the background traffic was drawing up</text>
  <text start="704.57" dur="4.26">dry drawing up very very quickly</text>
  <text start="706.84" dur="5.08">companies were having problems</text>
  <text start="708.83" dur="4.59">Bear Stearns Lehman AIG again in the</text>
  <text start="711.92" dur="3.78">background no one really knew about it</text>
  <text start="713.42" dur="5.57">unless you really looked at what was</text>
  <text start="715.7" dur="6.02">going on so when we hit</text>
  <text start="718.99" dur="5.219">that neutral area of 3% June July August</text>
  <text start="721.72" dur="5.28">when whenever we hit it it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="724.209" dur="6">a couple months after that might even</text>
  <text start="727" dur="7.589">bring us into the end of 2019 or the</text>
  <text start="730.209" dur="6.361">beginning of 2020 and we can see this is</text>
  <text start="734.589" dur="3.901">when the central bankers the deep state</text>
  <text start="736.57" dur="4.98">has been telling us that we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="738.49" dur="5.039">enter recession now again their plan is</text>
  <text start="741.55" dur="4.83">to bring this down and blame it on</text>
  <text start="743.529" dur="4.5">Trump&amp;#39;s policies Trump&amp;#39;s plan is to</text>
  <text start="746.38" dur="4.29">bring it down and blame it on the Fed</text>
  <text start="748.029" dur="4.831">and hopefully everything is in place to</text>
  <text start="750.67" dur="4.56">make this a smooth transition it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="752.86" dur="4.669">to be perfect no absolutely not there</text>
  <text start="755.23" dur="5.82">will be bumps but we&amp;#39;re already seeing</text>
  <text start="757.529" dur="7.031">that US banks they&amp;#39;re in trouble</text>
  <text start="761.05" dur="8.43">the Bank index is down 17 percent from</text>
  <text start="764.56" dur="8.79">January the EU baked index continues in</text>
  <text start="769.48" dur="5.609">collapse mode so u.s. KBW Bank index</text>
  <text start="773.35" dur="3.9">which tracks large US banks and serves</text>
  <text start="775.089" dur="4.801">as a benchmark for the banking sector is</text>
  <text start="777.25" dur="4.89">down 2.5 percent at the moment it has</text>
  <text start="779.89" dur="4.29">dropped 17 percent from its</text>
  <text start="782.14" dur="5.639">post-financial crisis high On January</text>
  <text start="784.18" dur="6.27">29th if the index closes at this level</text>
  <text start="787.779" dur="8.31">it will be the lowest close since</text>
  <text start="790.45" dur="8.69">September 18 2017 and we can see that</text>
  <text start="796.089" dur="6.091">with the European banks they are down</text>
  <text start="799.14" dur="5.77">26% and I know the Fed is telling us</text>
  <text start="802.18" dur="4.409">that the banks are great European the</text>
  <text start="804.91" dur="4.98">ECB is saying that the banks are great</text>
  <text start="806.589" dur="6.151">in Europe but we all know they modified</text>
  <text start="809.89" dur="4.5">they manipulated the tests to make it</text>
  <text start="812.74" dur="2.67">look like the banks are strong now they</text>
  <text start="814.39" dur="3.18">did this on purpose</text>
  <text start="815.41" dur="3.57">because after the financial crisis they</text>
  <text start="817.57" dur="3.69">wanted everyone to believe that the</text>
  <text start="818.98" dur="3.99">banks were okay they&amp;#39;re perfectly fine</text>
  <text start="821.26" dur="3.03">don&amp;#39;t worry about it and what they did</text>
  <text start="822.97" dur="2.97">was they said hey you know something</text>
  <text start="824.29" dur="4.38">we&amp;#39;ll come up with a stress test and</text>
  <text start="825.94" dur="5.07">we&amp;#39;ll you know take these banks we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="828.67" dur="5.159">apply the stress test and we&amp;#39;ll show</text>
  <text start="831.01" dur="5.4">everyone around the world how great the</text>
  <text start="833.829" dur="4.291">banking system is and of course they</text>
  <text start="836.41" dur="2.91">made these tests up they can manipulate</text>
  <text start="838.12" dur="3.209">them any way they want</text>
  <text start="839.32" dur="3.3">and they can make the tests look like</text>
  <text start="841.329" dur="3.45">any way they want and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="842.62" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;ve been doing but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="844.779" dur="5.331">right now is that countries they are</text>
  <text start="847.15" dur="5.41">moving away from the Swift system</text>
  <text start="850.11" dur="5.21">they&amp;#39;re dealing out</text>
  <text start="852.56" dur="6.27">side of the dollar they&amp;#39;re dealing in</text>
  <text start="855.32" dur="5.88">their national currencies and as time</text>
  <text start="858.83" dur="6.09">goes on more and more countries are</text>
  <text start="861.2" dur="5.97">going to hop on board remember this is a</text>
  <text start="864.92" dur="6">central bank system it&amp;#39;s a Federal</text>
  <text start="867.17" dur="6.81">Reserve Note and when you look at the</text>
  <text start="870.92" dur="5.04">bills you can see that right on top the</text>
  <text start="873.98" dur="3.48">US government does not issue these it</text>
  <text start="875.96" dur="4.319">comes from the Federal Reserve which is</text>
  <text start="877.46" dur="4.98">a private corporation yes the Treasury</text>
  <text start="880.279" dur="4.111">has to sign off on it makes it look all</text>
  <text start="882.44" dur="5.52">official and whatnot it&amp;#39;s a piece of</text>
  <text start="884.39" dur="5.4">paper that&amp;#39;s meaningless and basically</text>
  <text start="887.96" dur="5.33">they make it look like oh this is the</text>
  <text start="889.79" dur="5.97">official you know currency of the US</text>
  <text start="893.29" dur="5.68">well this is not the people&amp;#39;s currency</text>
  <text start="895.76" dur="5.73">this is not what we wanted this is not</text>
  <text start="898.97" dur="7.53">what the Constitution says this is what</text>
  <text start="901.49" dur="7.56">certain individuals back in 1913 which</text>
  <text start="906.5" dur="5.36">were wealthy bankers deep state</text>
  <text start="909.05" dur="5.85">operatives central banking community</text>
  <text start="911.86" dur="7.09">this is what they wanted to enrich</text>
  <text start="914.9" dur="6.63">themselves and to make sure they</text>
  <text start="918.95" dur="5.91">controlled the population of the United</text>
  <text start="921.53" dur="5.43">States and controlled the country what</text>
  <text start="924.86" dur="5.13">better way to control someone or a</text>
  <text start="926.96" dur="5.25">country then to put them into debt</text>
  <text start="929.99" dur="5.04">because once you have them into debt</text>
  <text start="932.21" dur="8.1">they have to do whatever you tell them</text>
  <text start="935.03" dur="7.14">to do or you collect on that debt and if</text>
  <text start="940.31" dur="5.88">you don&amp;#39;t have the funds what do you do</text>
  <text start="942.17" dur="7.56">you take their assets and what better</text>
  <text start="946.19" dur="7.17">way than to put each person the</text>
  <text start="949.73" dur="8.1">country&amp;#39;s into debt that&amp;#39;s a form of</text>
  <text start="953.36" dur="7.02">enslavement I mean we might not feel it</text>
  <text start="957.83" dur="5.58">you might think you&amp;#39;re free but in</text>
  <text start="960.38" dur="5.85">reality if you really think about it if</text>
  <text start="963.41" dur="5.73">the central bank said you know something</text>
  <text start="966.23" dur="5.609">we&amp;#39;re gonna collect now you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="969.14" dur="4.35">have to come up with what is it</text>
  <text start="971.839" dur="6.061">seventy thousand eighty thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="973.49" dur="6.42">and if it&amp;#39;s to people in your family I</text>
  <text start="977.9" dur="4.91">mean remember if it&amp;#39;s three people</text>
  <text start="979.91" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s each person it&amp;#39;s not per family</text>
  <text start="982.81" dur="2.61">might even me a little bit less a little</text>
  <text start="984.86" dur="2.06">bit more than</text>
  <text start="985.42" dur="3.66">I&amp;#39;m not looking at the exact</text>
  <text start="986.92" dur="5.16">calculations but you&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="989.08" dur="5.97">come up with that so do keep you under</text>
  <text start="992.08" dur="5.76">their control what do you do you keep</text>
  <text start="995.05" dur="5.52">working and working and working and you</text>
  <text start="997.84" dur="5.13">know what we will tax you on your work</text>
  <text start="1000.57" dur="3.03">and then we&amp;#39;ll place a hidden tax on you</text>
  <text start="1002.97" dur="2.52">which is called</text>
  <text start="1003.6" dur="3.93">inflation which means the value of the</text>
  <text start="1005.49" dur="4.32">dollar decreases and you need more of</text>
  <text start="1007.53" dur="5.82">your dollars to pay for these products I</text>
  <text start="1009.81" dur="7.14">mean that&amp;#39;s a hidden tax but it&amp;#39;s there</text>
  <text start="1013.35" dur="8.01">and you wrap all of this up and it keeps</text>
  <text start="1016.95" dur="6.54">the people enslaved in this system yes</text>
  <text start="1021.36" dur="5.37">some people do very well in the system</text>
  <text start="1023.49" dur="6.27">other people don&amp;#39;t and when you look at</text>
  <text start="1026.73" dur="5.94">the system overall there&amp;#39;s a lot more</text>
  <text start="1029.76" dur="8.06">people that don&amp;#39;t do very well in this</text>
  <text start="1032.67" dur="8.43">system and that&amp;#39;s what they really want</text>
  <text start="1037.82" dur="6.73">because they want the masses under their</text>
  <text start="1041.1" dur="6.33">control so this time when we go through</text>
  <text start="1044.55" dur="5.04">the next Depression the crash of the</text>
  <text start="1047.43" dur="4.38">system it is going to be very different</text>
  <text start="1049.59" dur="5.82">because this is going to be a turning</text>
  <text start="1051.81" dur="5.97">point where we point the finger at the</text>
  <text start="1055.41" dur="4.37">central bank where most likely we audit</text>
  <text start="1057.78" dur="4.44">the central bank and we take control</text>
  <text start="1059.78" dur="5.95">over the central bank which means we</text>
  <text start="1062.22" dur="5.01">take control over our lives once again</text>
  <text start="1065.73" dur="3.33">so everyone thanks a lot for listening</text>
