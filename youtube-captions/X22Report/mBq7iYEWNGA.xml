  <text start="74.67" dur="7.35">bankers are making their move to</text>
  <text start="78.47" dur="6.82">basically redirect everyone away from</text>
  <text start="82.02" dur="5.13">the cryptocurrencies and they are</text>
  <text start="85.29" dur="3.75">definitely making their play right now</text>
  <text start="87.15" dur="3.18">to make sure that people say yes</text>
  <text start="89.04" dur="3.78">cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="90.33" dur="5.25">it has its place but it will never</text>
  <text start="92.82" dur="4.47">replace the fiat currency system it will</text>
  <text start="95.58" dur="4.02">never replace what the central bank does</text>
  <text start="97.29" dur="4.23">and they are trying to make their case</text>
  <text start="99.6" dur="4.71">of why this isn&amp;#39;t going to happen and</text>
  <text start="101.52" dur="5.64">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="104.31" dur="6.48">trying to push their agenda of making</text>
  <text start="107.16" dur="7.29">sure that cryptocurrencies the</text>
  <text start="110.79" dur="5.82">blockchain system does not replace what</text>
  <text start="114.45" dur="3.69">the central banks are doing now which is</text>
  <text start="116.61" dur="3.539">just creating currency out of thin air</text>
  <text start="118.14" dur="3.36">they don&amp;#39;t do much of anything else yes</text>
  <text start="120.149" dur="4.201">they play with the markets they</text>
  <text start="121.5" dur="5.55">manipulate data they fund their covert</text>
  <text start="124.35" dur="5.939">operations with the deep state and other</text>
  <text start="127.05" dur="4.86">organizations but in Alton&amp;#39;s purposes we</text>
  <text start="130.289" dur="3.931">don&amp;#39;t need the central bank there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="131.91" dur="4.32">reason for them whatsoever they</text>
  <text start="134.22" dur="3.87">continually make up reasons why we need</text>
  <text start="136.23" dur="3.57">them but there is no reason why we need</text>
  <text start="138.09" dur="3.12">them a little bit later in this report</text>
  <text start="139.8" dur="3.75">I&amp;#39;m going to explain what they were</text>
  <text start="141.21" dur="3.99">trying to do and why they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="143.55" dur="2.7">make this move we already see at the</text>
  <text start="145.2" dur="4.5">same time and I mentioned this yesterday</text>
  <text start="146.25" dur="5.97">that the states they&amp;#39;re adopting crypto</text>
  <text start="149.7" dur="4.17">currencies the blockchain technology to</text>
  <text start="152.22" dur="3.96">be used as payments where you can pay</text>
  <text start="153.87" dur="3.78">your taxes corporations are looking at</text>
  <text start="156.18" dur="3.9">it saying you know something you&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="157.65" dur="4.68">able to pay for products using the</text>
  <text start="160.08" dur="4.56">blockchain technology and soon you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="162.33" dur="4.89">hear employer say you know what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="164.64" dur="4.62">gonna start paying people in crypto</text>
  <text start="167.22" dur="3.51">currencies now which one of these are</text>
  <text start="169.26" dur="3.42">going to be it might be like one it</text>
  <text start="170.73" dur="3.54">might be - it might be Bitcoin we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="172.68" dur="3.48">know as of yet but they will be using</text>
  <text start="174.27" dur="3.66">the blockchain technology there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="176.16" dur="3.54">thousands of different cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="177.93" dur="4.11">that are out there just like when the</text>
  <text start="179.7" dur="4.23">internet first came out there are a lot</text>
  <text start="182.04" dur="4.26">of websites a lot of businesses starting</text>
  <text start="183.93" dur="3.99">up and most of them didn&amp;#39;t make it</text>
  <text start="186.3" dur="4.08">same things gonna happen here in the</text>
  <text start="187.92" dur="5.31">crypto market and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="190.38" dur="5.37">there is a battle going on of who is</text>
  <text start="193.23" dur="4.29">going to control this system in the very</text>
  <text start="195.75" dur="3.21">end the central bankers want it to be</text>
  <text start="197.52" dur="4.77">them they&amp;#39;re gonna continually</text>
  <text start="198.96" dur="5.85">to demonize the blockchain technology</text>
  <text start="202.29" dur="4.41">especially Bitcoin and any other</text>
  <text start="204.81" dur="3.84">cryptocurrency they&amp;#39;re gonna tell us we</text>
  <text start="206.7" dur="4.11">need regulations they&amp;#39;re gonna say they</text>
  <text start="208.65" dur="4.35">need to control it they&amp;#39;re gonna put it</text>
  <text start="210.81" dur="4.14">down and on the other hand you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="213" dur="5.49">to see States corporations businesses</text>
  <text start="214.95" dur="8.34">the people pushing for cryptocurrency to</text>
  <text start="218.49" dur="7.32">be the system that the people run and</text>
  <text start="223.29" dur="4.65">the central bankers at this point and</text>
  <text start="225.81" dur="6.24">the banking system they won&amp;#39;t be needed</text>
  <text start="227.94" dur="7.59">but we see out in the UK the brexit</text>
  <text start="232.05" dur="6.09">right now is being pushed we know we</text>
  <text start="235.53" dur="4.83">have they had a referendum and the</text>
  <text start="238.14" dur="4.53">actual negotiations they could easily</text>
  <text start="240.36" dur="4.17">run up to the deadline in March of 2019</text>
  <text start="242.67" dur="4.86">when the when Britain is due to leave</text>
  <text start="244.53" dur="4.68">now if no agreement is forthcoming by</text>
  <text start="247.53" dur="4.23">that day both sides might agree to</text>
  <text start="249.21" dur="4.8">extend negotiations but that only seems</text>
  <text start="251.76" dur="4.199">likely if there&amp;#39;s a good prospect of an</text>
  <text start="254.01" dur="3.75">agreement otherwise Britain leaves and</text>
  <text start="255.959" dur="4.231">falls back on the World Trade</text>
  <text start="257.76" dur="5.43">Organisation training rules or does away</text>
  <text start="260.19" dur="5.43">with tariffs altogether now mais</text>
  <text start="263.19" dur="4.68">greatest problems are likely in dealing</text>
  <text start="265.62" dur="6.18">with her own advisor senior civil</text>
  <text start="267.87" dur="7.2">servants those individuals who are</text>
  <text start="271.8" dur="7.23">Keynes Ian&amp;#39;s and they don&amp;#39;t want the UK</text>
  <text start="275.07" dur="6.54">to leave the central banking system now</text>
  <text start="279.03" dur="4.68">we can see at this point time is short</text>
  <text start="281.61" dur="4.47">not only given the brexit timetable but</text>
  <text start="283.71" dur="4.77">ideally it must be concluded or at least</text>
  <text start="286.08" dur="4.95">set in stone before the disruption of</text>
  <text start="288.48" dur="5.31">the next crisis or global credit cycle</text>
  <text start="291.03" dur="4.11">and they are really running out of time</text>
  <text start="293.79" dur="3.18">at this point because when see that a</text>
  <text start="295.14" dur="5.46">lot of things are starting to break down</text>
  <text start="296.97" dur="5.52">and they have until 2019 they would like</text>
  <text start="300.6" dur="4.02">to have this done ahead of time but of</text>
  <text start="302.49" dur="5.04">course every time they tried to push it</text>
  <text start="304.62" dur="5.22">ahead the EU you know pushes back and</text>
  <text start="307.53" dur="4.41">they it&amp;#39;s very difficult to get anywhere</text>
  <text start="309.84" dur="3.63">and we see why because the central</text>
  <text start="311.94" dur="4.14">bankers they&amp;#39;re gonna do whatever they</text>
  <text start="313.47" dur="5.28">possibly can because nobody leaves their</text>
  <text start="316.08" dur="3.97">system nobody breaks away especially</text>
  <text start="318.75" dur="3.879">when they created it</text>
  <text start="320.05" dur="4.829">for everyone to be within it just like</text>
  <text start="322.629" dur="4.32">now with the crypto market with the</text>
  <text start="324.879" dur="3.69">transition the central bankers are gonna</text>
  <text start="326.949" dur="4.081">do whatever they have to to fight and</text>
  <text start="328.569" dur="4.921">keep everyone in their system in any</text>
  <text start="331.03" dur="4.949">country that is outside of their system</text>
  <text start="333.49" dur="4.95">well they become the enemy we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="335.979" dur="3.571">this before we see Amazon is doing</text>
  <text start="338.44" dur="3.06">something very interesting they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="339.55" dur="4.649">cutting about a hundred jobs at the</text>
  <text start="341.5" dur="5.759">Seattle headquarters and this is very</text>
  <text start="344.199" dur="5.25">odd because they&amp;#39;re booming in sales and</text>
  <text start="347.259" dur="3.991">they&amp;#39;re laying off people and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="349.449" dur="4.71">different stories that are going back</text>
  <text start="351.25" dur="4.409">and forth saying that Amazon you know</text>
  <text start="354.159" dur="4.621">they were subject to this New York Times</text>
  <text start="355.659" dur="5.341">bombshell article that was back in 2015</text>
  <text start="358.78" dur="3.9">that described a workplace culture where</text>
  <text start="361" dur="3.9">employees were constantly pitted against</text>
  <text start="362.68" dur="4.53">each other and managers were expected to</text>
  <text start="364.9" dur="3.989">be on call day and night the culture</text>
  <text start="367.21" dur="3.989">reportedly emanated from Jeff Bezos</text>
  <text start="368.889" dur="3.78">himself who has frequently pushed for</text>
  <text start="371.199" dur="4.59">the company to cull inadequate</text>
  <text start="372.669" dur="5.791">performers Amazon then denied the story</text>
  <text start="375.789" dur="4.741">but the Seattle Times say managers are</text>
  <text start="378.46" dur="4.889">under pressure from Bezos to weed out</text>
  <text start="380.53" dur="3.9">the lowest performing employees and this</text>
  <text start="383.349" dur="3">is what they&amp;#39;re going with right now</text>
  <text start="384.43" dur="3.93">maybe there&amp;#39;s something else that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="386.349" dur="3.54">underlying this whole entire thing but</text>
  <text start="388.36" dur="4.739">we see at this point something is</text>
  <text start="389.889" dur="5.4">definitely going on we see Trump well he</text>
  <text start="393.099" dur="5.43">has released his four trillion budget</text>
  <text start="395.289" dur="6.511">proposal and there are many different</text>
  <text start="398.529" dur="5.7">things that are within this proposal we</text>
  <text start="401.8" dur="6.149">see there is a 716 billion for defense</text>
  <text start="404.229" dur="6.99">which includes a 2% 2.6 percent pay</text>
  <text start="407.949" dur="6.93">raise for troops 80 billion in IT and</text>
  <text start="411.219" dur="6.841">cyber funding as well as 210 million for</text>
  <text start="414.879" dur="6.15">technology modernization fund nearly 17</text>
  <text start="418.06" dur="5.609">billion in opioid related spending in</text>
  <text start="421.029" dur="6.961">2019 including 10 billion in new funding</text>
  <text start="423.669" dur="5.791">for HHS requests 18 billion for border</text>
  <text start="427.99" dur="3.12">wall construction and there&amp;#39;s a whole</text>
  <text start="429.46" dur="3.6">list of other things going on here and</text>
  <text start="431.11" dur="4.26">we can see what is happening here and a</text>
  <text start="433.06" dur="4.65">lot of people are getting confused</text>
  <text start="435.37" dur="4.349">saying well this is not going to help</text>
  <text start="437.71" dur="2.4">the system this doesn&amp;#39;t help with the</text>
  <text start="439.719" dur="4.29">budget</text>
  <text start="440.11" dur="7.29">remember this fire system that the</text>
  <text start="444.009" dur="6.9">central bankers have created here it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="447.4" dur="6.299">pretty much dead take someone who is</text>
  <text start="450.909" dur="3.171">going bankrupt and they know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="453.699" dur="3.021">going to be</text>
  <text start="454.08" dur="4.2">bankrupt many of these individuals say</text>
  <text start="456.72" dur="3.87">you know what let&amp;#39;s put as much as we</text>
  <text start="458.28" dur="4.199">possibly can on the credit cards let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="460.59" dur="3.84">spend as much as we can because we know</text>
  <text start="462.479" dur="4.381">we&amp;#39;re gonna end up going bankrupt and</text>
  <text start="464.43" dur="5.1">all this is gonna be wiped away this</text>
  <text start="466.86" dur="5.07">system that we&amp;#39;re in right now well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="469.53" dur="4.319">the same thing the Chinese know this</text>
  <text start="471.93" dur="5.039">this is why they&amp;#39;ve been selling their</text>
  <text start="473.849" dur="6.12">Treasuries and using the dollars to</text>
  <text start="476.969" dur="7.741">build their infrastructure here might as</text>
  <text start="479.969" dur="7.95">well use the Fayette dollar system to</text>
  <text start="484.71" dur="5.16">build your infrastructure to pay for all</text>
  <text start="487.919" dur="5.131">this bring it up to a level that we need</text>
  <text start="489.87" dur="5.91">to bring it up to so when we transition</text>
  <text start="493.05" dur="4.29">guess what you don&amp;#39;t have to do that</text>
  <text start="495.78" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s completely out of the budget and</text>
  <text start="497.34" dur="5.46">all this fayette debt that the central</text>
  <text start="499.77" dur="4.769">bankers created and pushed it on the</text>
  <text start="502.8" dur="4.89">people well it just completely</text>
  <text start="504.539" dur="6.541">disappears now the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="507.69" dur="6.45">are pushing their agenda to create an</text>
  <text start="511.08" dur="7.29">atmosphere that the crypto market this</text>
  <text start="514.14" dur="6.72">is nothing that big it&amp;#39;s not a big deal</text>
  <text start="518.37" dur="5.849">it&amp;#39;s not gonna take over the Fayette</text>
  <text start="520.86" dur="7.2">currency system and its really nothing</text>
  <text start="524.219" dur="6.391">to look at now JP Morgan they created</text>
  <text start="528.06" dur="5.58">the Bitcoin Bible letting everyone know</text>
  <text start="530.61" dur="5.46">how cryptocurrencies works and saying</text>
  <text start="533.64" dur="5.4">you know what crypto and Bitcoin are and</text>
  <text start="536.07" dur="4.92">you know how it works and all that stuff</text>
  <text start="539.04" dur="3.75">and we know that Jamie Dimon was out</text>
  <text start="540.99" dur="4.32">there and he had this outburst against</text>
  <text start="542.79" dur="5.43">Bitcoin we know that JPMorgan they trade</text>
  <text start="545.31" dur="4.8">in Bitcoin there in the crypto market</text>
  <text start="548.22" dur="5.1">but they&amp;#39;re trying to make everyone</text>
  <text start="550.11" dur="6.51">believe that the crypto market is</text>
  <text start="553.32" dur="5.55">nothing to worry about and we could see</text>
  <text start="556.62" dur="5.459">that there&amp;#39;s about 71 pages of this</text>
  <text start="558.87" dur="5.04">Bible that they created and parts of it</text>
  <text start="562.079" dur="3.931">says you know giving the hurdles of</text>
  <text start="563.91" dur="4.289">cryptocurrencies there are more likely</text>
  <text start="566.01" dur="4.769">to be used as an ancillary payment</text>
  <text start="568.199" dur="5.791">method rather than gaining traction as a</text>
  <text start="570.779" dur="5.31">primary source of exchange while seeing</text>
  <text start="573.99" dur="3.63">a potential for the deployment of the</text>
  <text start="576.089" dur="3.301">underlying blockchain technology and</text>
  <text start="577.62" dur="3.99">payments we do not see cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="579.39" dur="5.4">competing with the central bank issued</text>
  <text start="581.61" dur="6.24">money for lawful transactions it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="584.79" dur="5.58">interesting how they put in their bang</text>
  <text start="587.85" dur="4.05">issued money for lawful transactions</text>
  <text start="590.37" dur="3.06">because what they&amp;#39;ve been trying to do</text>
  <text start="591.9" dur="4.23">is but they&amp;#39;ve been trying to show that</text>
  <text start="593.43" dur="5.82">cryptocurrencies is used by criminals</text>
  <text start="596.13" dur="4.44">terrorists and it&amp;#39;s unlawful some of the</text>
  <text start="599.25" dur="3.09">earlier buyers they said of</text>
  <text start="600.57" dur="3.36">cryptocurrencies were clearly dismayed</text>
  <text start="602.34" dur="3.93">by ballooning balance sheets of the</text>
  <text start="603.93" dur="4.8">major central banks in the aftermath of</text>
  <text start="606.27" dur="4.71">the global financial crisis but the lack</text>
  <text start="608.73" dur="5.1">of any meaningful inflation since then</text>
  <text start="610.98" dur="6.96">guess what it seems like they were wrong</text>
  <text start="613.83" dur="6.42">and everything is fine and they went on</text>
  <text start="617.94" dur="5.04">to say that several central banks as</text>
  <text start="620.25" dur="3.69">discussed in fur Olli are investigating</text>
  <text start="622.98" dur="3.66">whether they should issue</text>
  <text start="623.94" dur="5.57">cryptocurrencies in their own currency</text>
  <text start="626.64" dur="5.85">but are very far from actually doing so</text>
  <text start="629.51" dur="4.84">as any increased efficiency in payment</text>
  <text start="632.49" dur="4.05">technology does not appear to be that</text>
  <text start="634.35" dur="4.05">obvious in addition the issuance of</text>
  <text start="636.54" dur="4.92">crypto dollars for example would give</text>
  <text start="638.4" dur="5.46">non banks access to the Fed balance</text>
  <text start="641.46" dur="4.59">sheet and thus could endanger the</text>
  <text start="643.86" dur="4.8">economically and socially important</text>
  <text start="646.05" dur="4.5">financial intermediation function of</text>
  <text start="648.66" dur="3.93">commercial banks what they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="650.55" dur="4.4">saying is this would put them out of</text>
  <text start="652.59" dur="4.23">business and it would endanger</text>
  <text start="654.95" dur="4.99">everything that they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="656.82" dur="4.22">laundering money creating currency out</text>
  <text start="659.94" dur="4.05">of thin air</text>
  <text start="661.04" dur="4.72">keeping the Ponzi scheme going creating</text>
  <text start="663.99" dur="4.29">bubbles they went on to say if</text>
  <text start="665.76" dur="4.98">cryptocurrencies survive the next few</text>
  <text start="668.28" dur="2.76">years remember just listen to what</text>
  <text start="670.74" dur="2.61">they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="671.04" dur="4.98">if it survives the next few years and</text>
  <text start="673.35" dur="4.8">remains part of a global market then</text>
  <text start="676.02" dur="4.47">they will likely have exited their</text>
  <text start="678.15" dur="5.16">current speculative phase and will then</text>
  <text start="680.49" dur="8.19">have more normal returns volatilities</text>
  <text start="683.31" dur="7.23">and correlations based on its historical</text>
  <text start="688.68" dur="4.35">performance cryptocurrencies can be 10</text>
  <text start="690.54" dur="5.37">times more volatile than core assets</text>
  <text start="693.03" dur="5.91">like stocks or then portfolio hedges</text>
  <text start="695.91" dur="5.13">like commodities in the current market</text>
  <text start="698.94" dur="3.72">conditions we do not believe that in</text>
  <text start="701.04" dur="3.9">allocation to cryptocurrencies as</text>
  <text start="702.66" dur="4.32">insurance should be a portfolio&amp;#39;s main</text>
  <text start="704.94" dur="4.05">or only hedge note that even though</text>
  <text start="706.98" dur="3.78">cryptocurrencies have improved risk</text>
  <text start="708.99" dur="4.11">adjusted returns over the past several</text>
  <text start="710.76" dur="4.53">years they have not prevented portfolio</text>

  <text start="720.63" dur="5.01">February 20</text>
  <text start="721.56" dur="6.36">18 so they&amp;#39;re using those downturns in</text>
  <text start="725.64" dur="4.68">the cryptocurrency to say this is why</text>
  <text start="727.92" dur="4.89">you don&amp;#39;t want to use it so basically</text>
  <text start="730.32" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re trying to steer you away saying</text>
  <text start="732.81" dur="4.2">yes there is a place for them but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="735.12" dur="4.71">not going to replace what the banks and</text>
  <text start="737.01" dur="5.34">the central banks do now we move on to</text>
  <text start="739.83" dur="4.59">the IMF where we have Christine Lagarde</text>
  <text start="742.35" dur="3.51">she is out there saying it&amp;#39;s only a</text>
  <text start="744.42" dur="4.41">matter of time before cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="745.86" dur="6.21">come under government regulation yes</text>
  <text start="748.83" dur="5.43">regulations they are good but when they</text>
  <text start="752.07" dur="4.29">are regulated by the central banks that</text>
  <text start="754.26" dur="3.72">puts pressure on the government to make</text>
  <text start="756.36" dur="3.93">the central banks in control of</text>
  <text start="757.98" dur="5.76">everything that&amp;#39;s where there is a</text>
  <text start="760.29" dur="5.61">problem and she says it&amp;#39;s clearly a</text>
  <text start="763.74" dur="4.89">domain where we need international</text>
  <text start="765.9" dur="6.36">regular international regulation and</text>
  <text start="768.63" dur="7.14">proper supervision proper supervision by</text>
  <text start="772.26" dur="6.18">who and of course they mean them she</text>
  <text start="775.77" dur="6.06">also noted that there is probably quite</text>
  <text start="778.44" dur="7.2">a bit of dark activity in cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="781.83" dur="6.6">there&amp;#39;s no dark activity in currency</text>
  <text start="785.64" dur="3.449">that they created right there&amp;#39;s no money</text>
  <text start="788.43" dur="3.57">laundering</text>
  <text start="789.089" dur="5.581">there is no one&amp;#39;s stealing from the ATMs</text>

  <text start="804.69" dur="3.149">terrorism</text>
  <text start="805.38" dur="5.43">she said regulators need to focus less</text>

  <text start="810.81" dur="4.05">is doing what and whether they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="812.43" dur="4.59">properly licensed and supervised so</text>
  <text start="814.86" dur="4.979">basically she&amp;#39;s making the case of why</text>
  <text start="817.02" dur="5.37">the central bank system needs to control</text>
  <text start="819.839" dur="5.851">the crypto market and we can see already</text>
  <text start="822.39" dur="4.83">with Jamie Dimon with his Bitcoin Bible</text>
  <text start="825.69" dur="2.7">saying that yeah there&amp;#39;s a place for</text>
  <text start="827.22" dur="3">crypto currency but it&amp;#39;s not gonna</text>
  <text start="828.39" dur="3.69">replace a central bank then the IMF</text>
  <text start="830.22" dur="3.63">coming out saying yeah all you people</text>
  <text start="832.08" dur="4.259">that want cryptocurrency to replace us</text>
  <text start="833.85" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s not going to happen then we have</text>
  <text start="836.339" dur="5.071">the New York Fed economists out there</text>
  <text start="838.92" dur="4.85">and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York</text>
  <text start="841.41" dur="5.52">published an interview on their site on</text>
  <text start="843.77" dur="4.86">Friday February 9th in which two of its</text>
  <text start="846.93" dur="4.86">economists explained crypto currency</text>
  <text start="848.63" dur="5.829">highlighting cryptos trustless nature</text>
  <text start="851.79" dur="3.78">but expressing doubt that crypto</text>
  <text start="854.459" dur="2.941">currency could ever</text>
  <text start="855.57" dur="4.11">real is realistically compete with</text>
  <text start="857.4" dur="3.96">current payment methods on the notion</text>
  <text start="859.68" dur="4.65">that virtual currencies are not backed</text>
  <text start="861.36" dur="5.22">by anything real such as gold now they</text>
  <text start="864.33" dur="4.64">even came out and said listen crypto</text>
  <text start="866.58" dur="5.91">currencies aren&amp;#39;t backed by anything</text>
  <text start="868.97" dur="6.1">real just like it&amp;#39;s not backed by gold</text>
  <text start="872.49" dur="5.04">really than the dollars backed by gold</text>
  <text start="875.07" dur="3.9">no it&amp;#39;s not actually what is the dollar</text>
  <text start="877.53" dur="3.81">back by well that&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="878.97" dur="4.8">The Full Faith and Credit of the United</text>
  <text start="881.34" dur="3.54">States the dollar and all these</text>
  <text start="883.77" dur="3.84">currencies you see out there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="884.88" dur="6.63">backed by nothing they&amp;#39;re created out of</text>
  <text start="887.61" dur="6.21">thin air they&amp;#39;re really talking about</text>
  <text start="891.51" dur="4.38">themselves if you really think about it</text>
  <text start="893.82" dur="4.17">because if the central bankers are so</text>
  <text start="895.89" dur="4.05">concerned about having currency backed</text>
  <text start="897.99" dur="4.14">by something why didn&amp;#39;t they leave it</text>
  <text start="899.94" dur="3.39">backed by gold oh then they couldn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="902.13" dur="2.49">their dirty work then there couldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="903.33" dur="3.87">that all this money laundering and</text>
  <text start="904.62" dur="5.4">supplying funds for terrorism and all</text>
  <text start="907.2" dur="4.92">this other stuff and if you really think</text>
  <text start="910.02" dur="4.38">about it they&amp;#39;re trying to convince you</text>
  <text start="912.12" dur="5.19">that crypto currencies is a bad thing</text>
  <text start="914.4" dur="5.64">the economists went on to say that added</text>
  <text start="917.31" dur="5.79">that trust in a given currency is what</text>
  <text start="920.04" dur="5.58">gives it value in payment environment</text>
  <text start="923.1" dur="4.44">and makes it an acceptable medium of</text>
  <text start="925.62" dur="4.5">exchange in the case of crypto</text>
  <text start="927.54" dur="7.08">currencies said trust is not provided by</text>
  <text start="930.12" dur="7.38">any given government or institution only</text>
  <text start="934.62" dur="4.74">the blockchain technology hmm let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="937.5" dur="5.4">think about this for a second so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="939.36" dur="6.18">no central bank there&amp;#39;s no government or</text>
  <text start="942.9" dur="5.79">any other institution that can provide</text>
  <text start="945.54" dur="6.17">trust well the blockchain is a ledger</text>
  <text start="948.69" dur="7.53">you can go back and the ledger can&amp;#39;t lie</text>
  <text start="951.71" dur="7.3">because it&amp;#39;s diversified onto many</text>
  <text start="956.22" dur="4.68">different systems decentralized it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="959.01" dur="5.64">a central location where someone can go</text>
  <text start="960.9" dur="6.45">in and change the ledger so if you have</text>
  <text start="964.65" dur="4.65">a ledger entry in one location and it</text>
  <text start="967.35" dur="4.41">doesn&amp;#39;t match a ledger entry in three</text>
  <text start="969.3" dur="6.51">different locations guess what</text>
  <text start="971.76" dur="6.12">that one location is lying and what</text>
  <text start="975.81" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re trying to tell you is that you</text>
  <text start="977.88" dur="7.26">really want a truthful system like this</text>
  <text start="980.52" dur="6.75">ledger to be the trust machine yes we do</text>
  <text start="985.14" dur="4.199">because we can trust that because</text>
  <text start="987.27" dur="5.22">there&amp;#39;s no people involved</text>
  <text start="989.339" dur="4.62">in it like the central bank wait a</text>
  <text start="992.49" dur="3.42">minute the central bank is not</text>
  <text start="993.959" dur="5.011">transparent the central banks won&amp;#39;t let</text>
  <text start="995.91" dur="5.669">any government audit them actually the</text>
  <text start="998.97" dur="4.529">Fed won&amp;#39;t let the United States the</text>
  <text start="1001.579" dur="6.81">people of the United States audit the</text>
  <text start="1003.499" dur="9.03">Fed the entire blockchain technology is</text>
  <text start="1008.389" dur="6.901">one big Trust machine that&amp;#39;s the whole</text>
  <text start="1012.529" dur="5.67">purpose of it and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1015.29" dur="4.709">convince everyone that it isn&amp;#39;t and the</text>
  <text start="1018.199" dur="4.5">way they&amp;#39;re doing it is they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="1019.999" dur="5.641">you that you know it has a dark side it</text>
  <text start="1022.699" dur="5.34">can be used for terrorism it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1025.64" dur="4.769">trustworthy it&amp;#39;s not backed by anything</text>
  <text start="1028.039" dur="5.101">and if you really think about it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1030.409" dur="5.071">really the central bank system it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1033.14" dur="4.11">trustworthy the central banks won&amp;#39;t let</text>
  <text start="1035.48" dur="2.939">us see anything and what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1037.25" dur="4.079">we don&amp;#39;t know where the currency is</text>
  <text start="1038.419" dur="4.74">going it&amp;#39;s not backed by anything they</text>
  <text start="1041.329" dur="4.38">push a button and it&amp;#39;s created out of</text>
  <text start="1043.159" dur="5.221">thin air it&amp;#39;s used all over the world</text>
  <text start="1045.709" dur="5.371">for drug transactions to supply</text>
  <text start="1048.38" dur="6.15">terrorism with funds the intelligence</text>
  <text start="1051.08" dur="6.3">agencies use the currency to you to push</text>
  <text start="1054.53" dur="4.95">their covert operations they keep doing</text>
  <text start="1057.38" dur="4.14">this all over the place they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="1059.48" dur="4.23">talking about themselves and if you look</text>
  <text start="1061.52" dur="3.87">at the crypto market right now this is</text>
  <text start="1063.71" dur="5.28">based on a trust machine it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1065.39" dur="6">centralized where they create everything</text>
  <text start="1068.99" dur="3.87">they hide everything everything is out</text>
  <text start="1071.39" dur="4.14">in the open you can see what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1072.86" dur="3.179">they don&amp;#39;t like this they don&amp;#39;t like it</text>
  <text start="1075.53" dur="2.7">at all</text>
  <text start="1076.039" dur="5.281">yes maybe they&amp;#39;re not names attached to</text>
  <text start="1078.23" dur="5.46">everything but I have to say their</text>
  <text start="1081.32" dur="3.989">covert funding and their money</text>
  <text start="1083.69" dur="2.099">laundering there&amp;#39;s no names attached to</text>
  <text start="1085.309" dur="3.451">that either</text>
  <text start="1085.789" dur="5.671">so we can see right now they are making</text>
  <text start="1088.76" dur="4.139">their case of why and they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="1091.46" dur="4.349">worried if they&amp;#39;re doing this right now</text>
  <text start="1092.899" dur="6.301">they&amp;#39;re very worried that this is going</text>
  <text start="1095.809" dur="6.48">to overtake their system and they know</text>
  <text start="1099.2" dur="5.699">if it does they&amp;#39;re done for because</text>
  <text start="1102.289" dur="4.591">people will see that there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="1104.899" dur="3.811">to have a central bank there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="1106.88" dur="4.83">to have a bank so we have two things</text>
  <text start="1108.71" dur="6.27">happening right now we have the central</text>
  <text start="1111.71" dur="5.099">bankers pushing their agenda for the</text>
  <text start="1114.98" dur="4.65">transition they don&amp;#39;t want crypto</text>
  <text start="1116.809" dur="4.62">currencies they don&amp;#39;t want them yes</text>
  <text start="1119.63" dur="3.029">there&amp;#39;s a place for them but it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1121.429" dur="3.17">to be like</text>
  <text start="1122.659" dur="3.99">a gold market that we can control</text>
  <text start="1124.599" dur="4.361">commodities market that we can control</text>
  <text start="1126.649" dur="4.921">and don&amp;#39;t this is not going to replace</text>
  <text start="1128.96" dur="5.789">the fire currency system then we have</text>
  <text start="1131.57" dur="7.01">the people who want an open truth</text>
  <text start="1134.749" dur="9.51">machine that the people control and</text>
  <text start="1138.58" dur="9.61">nobody is borrowing this currency and no</text>
  <text start="1144.259" dur="8.461">one is expecting interest along with it</text>
  <text start="1148.19" dur="7.919">where they put people into debt that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1152.72" dur="5.639">what the central bankers do they lend</text>
  <text start="1156.109" dur="4.231">money out to governments they say now</text>
  <text start="1158.359" dur="4.89">you owe us the money that we just lent</text>
  <text start="1160.34" dur="5.069">you plus interest the blockchain doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1163.249" dur="4.38">work that way and again this goes</text>
  <text start="1165.409" dur="4.32">against their entire system so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1167.629" dur="4.23">going to see this battle rage right now</text>
  <text start="1169.729" dur="4.53">between the truth machine which is the</text>
  <text start="1171.859" dur="4.68">blockchain technology and the central</text>
  <text start="1174.259" dur="5.191">banks who are going to try to damage it</text>
  <text start="1176.539" dur="5.01">and I do believe they&amp;#39;re the ones who</text>
  <text start="1179.45" dur="4.799">bought a lot of Bitcoin they made</text>
  <text start="1181.549" dur="4.71">Bitcoin go up they sold it off they made</text>
  <text start="1184.249" dur="4.74">it drop because they wanted to show the</text>
  <text start="1186.259" dur="4.441">volatility because that&amp;#39;s the only way</text>
  <text start="1188.989" dur="5.731">and this is the only thing they can do</text>
  <text start="1190.7" dur="7.049">to make it look like it&amp;#39;s scary because</text>
  <text start="1194.72" dur="4.799">if you see this that is scary but guess</text>
  <text start="1197.749" dur="4.341">what in an open free market this is</text>
  <text start="1199.519" dur="5.191">really how it works a controlled market</text>
  <text start="1202.09" dur="4.839">everything looks like everything is</text>
  <text start="1204.71" dur="3.779">great but it&amp;#39;s an illusion because as</text>
  <text start="1206.929" dur="4.411">soon as they want to bring it down the</text>
  <text start="1208.489" dur="4.92">whole thing falls apart and we see right</text>
  <text start="1211.34" dur="4.199">now this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="1213.409" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re trying to scare everyone if you</text>
  <text start="1215.539" dur="3.51">notice every time they try to bring it</text>
  <text start="1217.159" dur="4.32">down and show people that it&amp;#39;s too scary</text>
  <text start="1219.049" dur="4.32">it shoots right back up because they</text>
  <text start="1221.479" dur="4.111">really can&amp;#39;t control it they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1223.369" dur="4.02">to with futures they&amp;#39;re trying to do it</text>
  <text start="1225.59" dur="3.569">with you know everything that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1227.389" dur="3.72">putting out there now but it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1229.159" dur="5.041">failing so we&amp;#39;re gonna see this battle</text>
