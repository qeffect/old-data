  <text start="75.58" dur="6.209">the corporate media and many alternative</text>
  <text start="78.729" dur="6.81">media channels are out there saying whoa</text>
  <text start="81.789" dur="8.28">Trump just signed a 1.3 trillion</text>
  <text start="85.539" dur="6.601">omnibus bill he&amp;#39;s betraying America this</text>
  <text start="90.069" dur="4.83">is not what we wanted a lot of the stuff</text>
  <text start="92.14" dur="5.61">in there is absolute garbage it allows</text>
  <text start="94.899" dur="5.521">the government to spy on the people but</text>
  <text start="97.75" dur="5.88">we need to look a little bit closer on</text>
  <text start="100.42" dur="5.67">what is happening here Neff nothing is</text>
  <text start="103.63" dur="4.71">by coincidence this is what queue</text>
  <text start="106.09" dur="5.13">normally says it&amp;#39;s all done for a</text>
  <text start="108.34" dur="5.61">specific reason you might not see it</text>
  <text start="111.22" dur="4.259">right now and you have to remember one</text>
  <text start="113.95" dur="4.77">thing that&amp;#39;s very important about all of</text>
  <text start="115.479" dur="6.81">this is that this isn&amp;#39;t your normal</text>
  <text start="118.72" dur="6.09">everyday politician where this</text>
  <text start="122.289" dur="4.801">individual was groomed to be a</text>
  <text start="124.81" dur="5.55">politician this individual was put out</text>
  <text start="127.09" dur="7.59">there to do a specific task this is an</text>
  <text start="130.36" dur="9.06">individual that knows how to create and</text>
  <text start="134.68" dur="7.83">work deals creates fortunes understands</text>
  <text start="139.42" dur="5.099">what happens when fortunes are lost when</text>
  <text start="142.51" dur="6.089">you need to go bankrupt no it&amp;#39;s how to</text>
  <text start="144.519" dur="8.25">basically maneuver around it and knows</text>
  <text start="148.599" dur="6.511">how to play people you need to keep all</text>
  <text start="152.769" dur="4.411">of this in mind that everything is not</text>
  <text start="155.11" dur="4.92">the same anymore and you need to look</text>
  <text start="157.18" dur="4.559">past you need to basically open your</text>
  <text start="160.03" dur="4.23">mind because your mind is like a</text>
  <text start="161.739" dur="4.981">parachute if it&amp;#39;s not open it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="164.26" dur="4.649">work so when we start to look at these</text>
  <text start="166.72" dur="4.739">things we need to look at everything in</text>
  <text start="168.909" dur="4.11">a different way just like looking at</text>
  <text start="171.459" dur="3.42">North Korea where everyone was talking</text>
  <text start="173.019" dur="3.901">about war we&amp;#39;re talking about John</text>
  <text start="174.879" dur="5.64">Bolton today and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="176.92" dur="5.489">economic situation and what is what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="180.519" dur="3.241">trying to do here not just Trump but</text>
  <text start="182.409" dur="3.871">there&amp;#39;s a lot of Patriots behind this</text>
  <text start="183.76" dur="6.63">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do and what</text>
  <text start="186.28" dur="8.88">is being done right now it is all done</text>
  <text start="190.39" dur="8.63">on purpose in a specific way to bring us</text>
  <text start="195.16" dur="9.39">out of a system that was created back in</text>
  <text start="199.02" dur="7.96">1913 which was then modified in 1971</text>
  <text start="204.55" dur="4.86">where the central bankers and the</text>
  <text start="206.98" dur="6.06">developing deep state got larger and</text>
  <text start="209.41" dur="6.39">bigger and more powerful and took over</text>
  <text start="213.04" dur="5.19">pretty much everything now yes Trump</text>
  <text start="215.8" dur="5.76">said he was going to veto this omnibus</text>
  <text start="218.23" dur="7.05">spending bill remember it is a spending</text>
  <text start="221.56" dur="7.649">bill this is not a budget don&amp;#39;t get them</text>
  <text start="225.28" dur="6.66">confused this is a spending bill Obama</text>
  <text start="229.209" dur="4.741">during his presidency signed many of</text>
  <text start="231.94" dur="5.07">these why because you don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="233.95" dur="5.16">Congress&amp;#39;s approval to spend the money</text>
  <text start="237.01" dur="5.16">this is why billions and billions and</text>
  <text start="239.11" dur="6.18">billions of it is completely gone I mean</text>
  <text start="242.17" dur="6.63">Obama signed a 1.8 trillion dollar</text>
  <text start="245.29" dur="3.9">spending bill what is happening right</text>
  <text start="248.8" dur="4.02">now</text>
  <text start="249.19" dur="6.299">is Trump is allowing Congress all these</text>
  <text start="252.82" dur="8.52">individuals to do what they do best and</text>
  <text start="255.489" dur="11.251">that is to basically spend like crazy</text>
  <text start="261.34" dur="7.44">how do you destroy a system can you come</text>
  <text start="266.74" dur="4.02">in there and say listen we&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="268.78" dur="4.44">to stop all these entitlement programs</text>
  <text start="270.76" dur="3.93">listen we&amp;#39;re gonna have to cut all this</text>
  <text start="273.22" dur="2.759">out you won&amp;#39;t be able to spend any of</text>
  <text start="274.69" dur="4.17">this money no he can&amp;#39;t say this to</text>
  <text start="275.979" dur="5.971">Congress he needs and he needs to allow</text>
  <text start="278.86" dur="5.76">them to bury themselves this is what is</text>
  <text start="281.95" dur="5.339">happening right now now this this</text>
  <text start="284.62" dur="4.59">spending bill was like 2,200 30 pages</text>
  <text start="287.289" dur="4.561">and there&amp;#39;s no way that any of them read</text>
  <text start="289.21" dur="5.16">this because they only had like 17 hours</text>
  <text start="291.85" dur="4.68">to pass it and you&amp;#39;d have to read every</text>
  <text start="294.37" dur="4.44">single page how would you do that in</text>
  <text start="296.53" dur="3.96">that specific time period it&amp;#39;d be almost</text>
  <text start="298.81" dur="4.56">impossible to really understand to grasp</text>
  <text start="300.49" dur="4.47">what was going on I think Rand Paul read</text>
  <text start="303.37" dur="3.84">about 600 pages and stopped and said</text>
  <text start="304.96" dur="4.5">this is complete garbage that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="307.21" dur="6.66">what it is but what does it allow the</text>
  <text start="309.46" dur="9.3">president to do well that&amp;#39;s the whole</text>
  <text start="313.87" dur="9.78">point of this it gives him control</text>
  <text start="318.76" dur="6.36">hower it gives him 1.3 trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="323.65" dur="3.9">now he doesn&amp;#39;t have to do anything with</text>
  <text start="325.12" dur="5.73">that he doesn&amp;#39;t have to do what Congress</text>
  <text start="327.55" dur="7.97">wants the spending bill is not a budget</text>
  <text start="330.85" dur="7.35">it&amp;#39;s a such a package that is set up as</text>
  <text start="335.52" dur="4.84">spending and the Congress gives him</text>
  <text start="338.2" dur="4.77">suggestions on what this money should be</text>
  <text start="340.36" dur="5.52">used for like the African Development</text>
  <text start="342.97" dur="5.19">Foundation 30 million the Corporation</text>
  <text start="345.88" dur="4.7">for National community service 1 billion</text>
  <text start="348.16" dur="5.19">the Corporation for Public Broadcasting</text>
  <text start="350.58" dur="5.11">445 million that&amp;#39;s PBS parent company</text>
  <text start="353.35" dur="4.98">the Delta Regional Authority 10 million</text>
  <text start="355.69" dur="6.54">the Denali Commission double budget now</text>
  <text start="358.33" dur="5.87">at 30 million and it goes on and on and</text>
  <text start="362.23" dur="5.37">I mean there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot in here and</text>
  <text start="364.2" dur="5.56">he doesn&amp;#39;t have to do any of this he can</text>
  <text start="367.6" dur="6.57">do whatever he wants with the money like</text>
  <text start="369.76" dur="6.24">maybe build a wall something that they</text>
  <text start="374.17" dur="5.34">were trying to stop him from doing it</text>
  <text start="376" dur="6.57">also allows him to go up against the</text>
  <text start="379.51" dur="6.75">deep state he has control and power now</text>
  <text start="382.57" dur="6.39">of funds that he never had before think</text>
  <text start="386.26" dur="5.97">about this this is the final stage this</text>
  <text start="388.96" dur="5.49">is why he said this type of bill will</text>
  <text start="392.23" dur="5.46">never be signed again there&amp;#39;s a reason</text>
  <text start="394.45" dur="6.57">why he said this it&amp;#39;s because when this</text>
  <text start="397.69" dur="4.58">system is reset this is not going to</text>
  <text start="401.02" dur="4.65">happen again</text>
  <text start="402.27" dur="7.48">this is the old system and he&amp;#39;s using</text>
  <text start="405.67" dur="7.98">the old system to basically get what he</text>
  <text start="409.75" dur="8.18">needs and he&amp;#39;s using it to push his</text>
  <text start="413.65" dur="6.54">agenda to bring down the system now</text>
  <text start="417.93" dur="5.5">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this this</text>
  <text start="420.19" dur="4.95">spending bill Congress the Senate House</text>
  <text start="423.43" dur="6.6">of Representatives they gave themselves</text>
  <text start="425.14" dur="6.9">raises I mean if you look at the Omnibus</text>
  <text start="430.03" dur="3.75">division one of the legislation break</text>
  <text start="432.04" dur="4.14">down the total salaries of officers</text>
  <text start="433.78" dur="4.92">employees and basically they gave them a</text>
  <text start="436.18" dur="4.41">whole raises they gave they put out this</text>
  <text start="438.7" dur="4.08">spending bill as 1.3 trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="440.59" dur="4.38">and they all think they deserve a raise</text>
  <text start="442.78" dur="4.68">actually we should be removing their</text>
  <text start="444.97" dur="3.84">funds now everyone&amp;#39;s like oh my god I</text>
  <text start="447.46" dur="3.21">can&amp;#39;t believe this Trump is doing the</text>
  <text start="448.81" dur="3.359">same thing that Obama did well let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="450.67" dur="4.23">think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="452.169" dur="5.46">Trump isn&amp;#39;t spending isn&amp;#39;t taking a</text>
  <text start="454.9" dur="4.829">salary he&amp;#39;s already a billionaire he</text>
  <text start="457.629" dur="3.81">doesn&amp;#39;t need any type of funds he</text>
  <text start="459.729" dur="5.131">doesn&amp;#39;t have to siphon this off there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="461.439" dur="5.34">no reason to do that and he&amp;#39;s not taking</text>
  <text start="464.86" dur="6.139">a salary he&amp;#39;s actually donating it to</text>
  <text start="466.779" dur="7.711">different agencies he&amp;#39;s using this to</text>
  <text start="470.999" dur="5.98">fight what is happening right now and he</text>
  <text start="474.49" dur="4.169">gives him a lot of power now let&amp;#39;s talk</text>
  <text start="476.979" dur="6.18">about what the president can and can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="478.659" dur="6.421">do with this omnes omnibus bill there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="483.159" dur="4.081">a lot of discussion both ways so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="485.08" dur="4.98">examine how money gets allocated and</text>
  <text start="487.24" dur="4.679">spent in the US government Congress</text>
  <text start="490.06" dur="3.8">allocates money to be spent the</text>
  <text start="491.919" dur="4.68">president spends the allocated money</text>
  <text start="493.86" dur="5.049">once Congress allocates money their job</text>
  <text start="496.599" dur="4.981">is oversight of the money being spent</text>
  <text start="498.909" dur="4.081">they don&amp;#39;t spend the money and have no</text>
  <text start="501.58" dur="5.22">say how it gets spent</text>
  <text start="502.99" dur="7.199">as long as it&amp;#39;s spent legally that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="506.8" dur="5.52">their job to monitor with oversight once</text>
  <text start="510.189" dur="4.14">the president is given the money with</text>
  <text start="512.32" dur="4.379">instructions to spend it he has a number</text>
  <text start="514.329" dur="4.351">of choices to make in spending it there</text>
  <text start="516.699" dur="4.561">are some rules he has to follow and some</text>
  <text start="518.68" dur="4.2">of the money is fungible replaceable by</text>
  <text start="521.26" dur="2.459">another identical item mutually</text>
  <text start="522.88" dur="3.449">interchangeable</text>
  <text start="523.719" dur="5.041">and some isn&amp;#39;t however there are some</text>
  <text start="526.329" dur="4.26">other factors that are in play here one</text>
  <text start="528.76" dur="4.5">of them is that the president has</text>
  <text start="530.589" dur="5.821">declared a human rights emergency and</text>
  <text start="533.26" dur="5.37">has notified Congress that he&amp;#39;s invoking</text>
  <text start="536.41" dur="5.64">the balanced budget and emergency</text>
  <text start="538.63" dur="6.54">deficit Control Act of 1985 this opens</text>
  <text start="542.05" dur="5.34">up new options by making these two</text>
  <text start="545.17" dur="3.539">declarations President Trump has just</text>
  <text start="547.39" dur="6.449">communicated that he has the authority</text>
  <text start="548.709" dur="8.521">to not spend any funds he doesn&amp;#39;t deem</text>
  <text start="553.839" dur="3.87">necessary and will return them to the US</text>
  <text start="557.23" dur="2.91">Treasury</text>
  <text start="557.709" dur="4.951">so funds for like Planned Parenthood and</text>
  <text start="560.14" dur="6.12">many other things he doesn&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="562.66" dur="8.01">allocate them look what he&amp;#39;s doing here</text>
  <text start="566.26" dur="8.49">already you can see how much control he</text>
  <text start="570.67" dur="6.029">has also these declarations make some</text>
  <text start="574.75" dur="3.69">funds fungible for instance if he</text>
  <text start="576.699" dur="4.14">determines that building a wall on the</text>
  <text start="578.44" dur="4.769">southern border is a defense against</text>
  <text start="580.839" dur="3.93">human trafficking he can move funds from</text>
  <text start="583.209" dur="2.401">anywhere else in the Defense Department</text>
  <text start="584.769" dur="6.441">allocation</text>
  <text start="585.61" dur="8.91">and simply build the wall it&amp;#39;s that easy</text>
  <text start="591.21" dur="6.34">now Congress is powerless to stop cash</text>
  <text start="594.52" dur="5.25">reallocations on an omnibus bill and</text>
  <text start="597.55" dur="4.26">cannot stop the Department of Defense</text>
  <text start="599.77" dur="2.85">from taking measures under a declared</text>
  <text start="601.81" dur="3.18">emergency</text>
  <text start="602.62" dur="4.86">now despite their language in the</text>
  <text start="604.99" dur="5.28">omnibus bill about the border wall it is</text>
  <text start="607.48" dur="6.75">trumped by the state of emergency that</text>
  <text start="610.27" dur="5.82">Trump declared so in summary this will</text>
  <text start="614.23" dur="3.66">go to the courts Congress will sue the</text>
  <text start="616.09" dur="3.93">president over the border wall but</text>
  <text start="617.89" dur="4.35">here&amp;#39;s how it will play out Congress and</text>
  <text start="620.02" dur="4.44">the president are co-equal branches with</text>
  <text start="622.24" dur="5.64">different functions Congress allocates</text>
  <text start="624.46" dur="6.66">the president spends guess what he will</text>
  <text start="627.88" dur="6.06">win the president has national security</text>
  <text start="631.12" dur="4.83">as his primary responsibility and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="633.94" dur="5.1">his job to use whatever funds and</text>
  <text start="635.95" dur="6.3">declarations he needs for that job no</text>
  <text start="639.04" dur="5.43">court in this nation would ever rule</text>
  <text start="642.25" dur="4.74">against the president for exercising</text>
  <text start="644.47" dur="5.07">that authority in the end the Supreme</text>
  <text start="646.99" dur="4.53">Court will fully validate the</text>
  <text start="649.54" dur="5.07">president&amp;#39;s constitutional authority and</text>
  <text start="651.52" dur="5.4">the wall will be built and anything else</text>
  <text start="654.61" dur="5.54">that he wants to do he will be allowed</text>
  <text start="656.92" dur="6.93">to do this now remember many of these</text>
  <text start="660.15" dur="6.58">government officials they put this</text>
  <text start="663.85" dur="7.62">together not to help the American people</text>
  <text start="666.73" dur="8.28">it was put together to help private</text>
  <text start="671.47" dur="6.99">groups certain entities and this was</text>
  <text start="675.01" dur="8.9">kind of like a payoff to them and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="678.46" dur="8.19">all being shut down and cut off by this</text>
  <text start="683.91" dur="6.13">balanced budget and emergency deficit</text>
  <text start="686.65" dur="5.16">Control Act of 1985 that he invoked so</text>
  <text start="690.04" dur="5.13">this is giving him control right now</text>
  <text start="691.81" dur="6.9">because this is the last stage of the</text>
  <text start="695.17" dur="5.55">economic implosion of the central</text>
  <text start="698.71" dur="5.85">banking system remember the central</text>
  <text start="700.72" dur="7.32">banking system their entire existing is</text>
  <text start="704.56" dur="6.27">existence is to keep countries from</text>
  <text start="708.04" dur="4.35">going bankrupt if you really look at</text>
  <text start="710.83" dur="3.63">what&amp;#39;s going on here I mean look at</text>
  <text start="712.39" dur="6.18">Greece for instance they will never ever</text>
  <text start="714.46" dur="4.85">allow Greece to declare bankruptcy and</text>
  <text start="718.57" dur="3.18">default</text>
  <text start="719.31" dur="4.96">because then every other country would</text>
  <text start="721.75" dur="4.86">look at this inside wait a minute we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="724.27" dur="4.68">under the central banker role they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="726.61" dur="4.59">handling our economies and this country</text>
  <text start="728.95" dur="4.82">just defaulted no they can&amp;#39;t let that</text>
  <text start="731.2" dur="5.73">happen so they always keep countries</text>
  <text start="733.77" dur="5.86">right at that space where they&amp;#39;re almost</text>
  <text start="736.93" dur="6.14">ready to default but they never will but</text>
  <text start="739.63" dur="6.48">they will push countries to push</text>
  <text start="743.07" dur="5.71">austerity on the people they will cut</text>
  <text start="746.11" dur="4.68">budgets they will cut employees that</text>
  <text start="748.78" dur="6.89">will cut everything except for the money</text>
  <text start="750.79" dur="8.76">going to the creditors here we are with</text>
  <text start="755.67" dur="6.97">this system where this is going to be</text>
  <text start="759.55" dur="5.04">the first instance where this system is</text>
  <text start="762.64" dur="4.44">going to be brought down where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="764.59" dur="4.41">going to expose the central bankers</text>
  <text start="767.08" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re headed right now now</text>
  <text start="769" dur="5.49">there are a lot of things in play at</text>
  <text start="771.07" dur="5.61">this point and the IMF they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="774.49" dur="5.61">nervous the Fed is getting nervous</text>
  <text start="776.68" dur="5.64">they realize what he&amp;#39;s up to actually</text>
  <text start="780.1" dur="6.26">Christine Lagarde was out there and she</text>
  <text start="782.32" dur="7.49">has proposed a rainy day fund for</text>
  <text start="786.36" dur="7.65">building up assets in the good times and</text>
  <text start="789.81" dur="6.91">having those available during downturns</text>
  <text start="794.01" dur="4.9">so this way countries would be able to</text>
  <text start="796.72" dur="4.77">receive funding to help offset budget</text>
  <text start="798.91" dur="5.82">shortfalls you know if we enter some</text>
  <text start="801.49" dur="6.63">type of economic crisis and this would</text>
  <text start="804.73" dur="6.6">help banks it would help the eurozone it</text>
  <text start="808.12" dur="5.55">would help anyone that needs it because</text>
  <text start="811.33" dur="4.59">they realize what&amp;#39;s approaching they</text>
  <text start="813.67" dur="4.11">realize that this system is going to be</text>
  <text start="815.92" dur="4.02">brought down and it&amp;#39;s not going to be by</text>
  <text start="817.78" dur="5.19">the central banking system it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="819.94" dur="5.58">be brought down by Trump and the</text>
  <text start="822.97" dur="4.41">Patriots those who are working to get</text>
  <text start="825.52" dur="4.29">rid of the central banks and they</text>
  <text start="827.38" dur="5.46">realize they&amp;#39;re gonna try to fight</text>
  <text start="829.81" dur="5.13">against this because remember you need</text>
  <text start="832.84" dur="4.29">to declare default you need to say we</text>
  <text start="834.94" dur="4.71">can&amp;#39;t pay any of this debt back and they</text>
  <text start="837.13" dur="3.84">need to push that and this is going to</text>
  <text start="839.65" dur="3.75">be a battle all the way up to the end</text>
  <text start="840.97" dur="4.44">now the petrol you on futures was just</text>
  <text start="843.4" dur="5.22">released and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="845.41" dur="6.93">it is a huge success in the first you</text>
  <text start="848.62" dur="4.53">know a couple of hours here and the oil</text>
  <text start="852.34" dur="2.28">futures they were</text>
  <text start="853.15" dur="4.95">launched overnight in Shanghai with</text>
  <text start="854.62" dur="6">about 60 2500 contracts traded in</text>
  <text start="858.1" dur="5.28">aggregate meaning over 62 million</text>
  <text start="860.62" dur="5.61">barrels of oil change hands for a</text>
  <text start="863.38" dur="6.45">notional volume of around 27 billion you</text>
  <text start="866.23" dur="5.7">want over four billion dollars and this</text>
  <text start="869.83" dur="4.89">surged up and then of course it evened</text>
  <text start="871.93" dur="5.34">out even bypassed the Brent crude in</text>
  <text start="874.72" dur="4.11">London the benchmark there and then it</text>
  <text start="877.27" dur="3.15">started to even out which which</text>
  <text start="878.83" dur="5.18">basically it&amp;#39;s going to do now the Petri</text>
  <text start="880.42" dur="7.89">one is challenging the petro dollar and</text>
  <text start="884.01" dur="7.99">again as we know this is going to push</text>
  <text start="888.31" dur="4.67">the petro dollar out this is the plan</text>
  <text start="892" dur="6.36">right now</text>
  <text start="892.98" dur="8.95">and we see right now once China is able</text>
  <text start="898.36" dur="5.87">to push and basically push the dollar</text>
  <text start="901.93" dur="5.37">basically push the petro dollar down</text>
  <text start="904.23" dur="6.97">China remember is the world&amp;#39;s leading</text>
  <text start="907.3" dur="7.17">consumer of oil Beijing can then exert</text>
  <text start="911.2" dur="7.59">some real leverage over Saudi Arabia to</text>
  <text start="914.47" dur="5.91">pay for crude in yuyuan I mean this is</text>
  <text start="918.79" dur="3.6">something that&amp;#39;s not going to take that</text>
  <text start="920.38" dur="5.25">much time this is something that can</text>
  <text start="922.39" dur="4.98">happen in a very short period of time</text>
  <text start="925.63" dur="4.35">where other countries say you know</text>
  <text start="927.37" dur="6.6">something we&amp;#39;re gonna use the petro yuan</text>
  <text start="929.98" dur="7.02">now instead of the petro dollar that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="933.97" dur="5.58">how quickly they can do this in 1971</text>
  <text start="937" dur="3.44">when they were bringing the new system</text>
  <text start="939.55" dur="4.56">online</text>
  <text start="940.44" dur="4.93">it didn&amp;#39;t take another 20 years Saudi</text>
  <text start="944.11" dur="2.61">Arabia and the rest of the Middle</text>
  <text start="945.37" dur="3.57">Eastern country said okay we&amp;#39;ll use the</text>
  <text start="946.72" dur="3.93">petro dollar not a big deal and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="948.94" dur="4.83">the that&amp;#39;s the only country will</text>
  <text start="950.65" dur="5.64">currency will use and every country out</text>
  <text start="953.77" dur="4.62">there will have to use the dollar it</text>
  <text start="956.29" dur="4.02">happened very quickly yes there were a</text>
  <text start="958.39" dur="4.71">couple of months maybe up to a year</text>
  <text start="960.31" dur="4.02">where everything was a little mixed up</text>
  <text start="963.1" dur="3.42">and things like that where people</text>
  <text start="964.33" dur="4.89">couldn&amp;#39;t get fuel there were lines and</text>
  <text start="966.52" dur="4.2">yet ago and odd even days with their</text>
  <text start="969.22" dur="3.33">with your plate numbers and things like</text>
  <text start="970.72" dur="3.81">red and green flags and all that kind of</text>
  <text start="972.55" dur="5.31">stuff but eventually it all evened out</text>
  <text start="974.53" dur="4.77">and again the the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="977.86" dur="3.24">were loaning the government like crazy</text>
  <text start="979.3" dur="4.47">and we are creating currency like crazy</text>
  <text start="981.1" dur="4.77">and this is why the value of the dollar</text>
  <text start="983.77" dur="2.91">decreased so rapidly interest rates went</text>
  <text start="985.87" dur="3.81">up and that</text>
  <text start="986.68" dur="4.469">was the beginning of the new petrodollar</text>
  <text start="989.68" dur="3.719">system as we came off the gold standard</text>
  <text start="991.149" dur="5.821">here we are at the end of the system</text>
  <text start="993.399" dur="6.481">interest rates very very low wages are</text>
  <text start="996.97" dur="5.66">declining the dollar is worth absolutely</text>
  <text start="999.88" dur="5.34">nothing it&amp;#39;s falling in value and</text>
  <text start="1002.63" dur="5.41">there&amp;#39;s a new system that is being</text>
  <text start="1005.22" dur="5.429">implemented right now and with the</text>
  <text start="1008.04" dur="5.97">petrodollars downfall it most likely</text>
  <text start="1010.649" dur="5.88">will lift gold and we&amp;#39;ll see gold start</text>
  <text start="1014.01" dur="5.43">to really move up and that will move up</text>
  <text start="1016.529" dur="5.971">very very quickly and we can see right</text>
  <text start="1019.44" dur="5.58">now it&amp;#39;s been moving up and when</text>
  <text start="1022.5" dur="3.839">everything is said and done the markets</text>
  <text start="1025.02" dur="3.929">will be destroyed I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="1026.339" dur="4.35">stock market the system that the central</text>
  <text start="1028.949" dur="3.331">bankers that have been controlling the</text>
  <text start="1030.689" dur="4.081">world for such a long time will be</text>
  <text start="1032.28" dur="4.529">destroyed this is where we&amp;#39;re headed</text>
  <text start="1034.77" dur="4.74">right now and we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="1036.809" dur="3.87">the central bankers well they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="1039.51" dur="2.88">their agenda they&amp;#39;re raising the</text>
  <text start="1040.679" dur="4.711">interest rates they&amp;#39;re trying to keep</text>
  <text start="1042.39" dur="4.14">their system control the narrative Trump</text>
  <text start="1045.39" dur="2.819">and the Patriots are doing the same</text>
  <text start="1046.53" dur="3.51">exact thing and you can see we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1048.209" dur="3.301">heading towards the same point where the</text>
  <text start="1050.04" dur="3.66">system&amp;#39;s coming down now one&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1051.51" dur="3.6">be a soft transition one&amp;#39;s gonna be up a</text>
  <text start="1053.7" dur="3.54">little bit rougher that&amp;#39;s the central</text>
  <text start="1055.11" dur="3.54">banker if they went out and this is what</text>
