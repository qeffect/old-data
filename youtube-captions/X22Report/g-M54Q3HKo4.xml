  <text start="93.369" dur="4.831">drivers include debt to GDP projections</text>
  <text start="96.22" dur="4.95">rising and substantially weaker economic</text>
  <text start="98.2" dur="5.12">output and forecast and I don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="101.17" dur="5.809">know if this really comes as a surprise</text>
  <text start="103.32" dur="7.42">when we look around the European nations</text>
  <text start="106.979" dur="6.911">they are on the cusp of completely</text>
  <text start="110.74" dur="6.51">breaking down and moving into a deep</text>
  <text start="113.89" dur="8.399">recession / depression I mean we look at</text>
  <text start="117.25" dur="8.88">Portugal Spain Cyprus Greece you know we</text>
  <text start="122.289" dur="7.411">see all this just completely falling</text>
  <text start="126.13" dur="7.08">apart and again here in the United</text>
  <text start="129.7" dur="7.11">States what do we see here we see the</text>
  <text start="133.21" dur="6.48">stock market reaching all-time new</text>
  <text start="136.81" dur="6.48">everyone&amp;#39;s all clapping in array and</text>
  <text start="139.69" dur="7.23">that&amp;#39;s because ben bernanke is not going</text>
  <text start="143.29" dur="7.11">to stop the money printing because</text>
  <text start="146.92" dur="7.83">basically he he cannot he cannot stop</text>
  <text start="150.4" dur="7.23">the money printing if he stops collapse</text>
  <text start="154.75" dur="7.099">right now government is not ready they</text>
  <text start="157.63" dur="7.139">need certain things to get laws passed</text>
  <text start="161.849" dur="7.45">things nailed down so they are</text>
  <text start="164.769" dur="7.05">completely ready so they are not ready</text>
  <text start="169.299" dur="5.761">for this thing to unwind and completely</text>
  <text start="171.819" dur="5.7">come tumbling down so they need to</text>
  <text start="175.06" dur="6.36">continually that the Fed needs to</text>
  <text start="177.519" dur="6.841">continually to print more money and we</text>
  <text start="181.42" dur="5.16">can see here in the states that there is</text>
  <text start="184.36" dur="6.06">a disconnect between the stock market</text>
  <text start="186.58" dur="5.34">and the economy and again with the</text>
  <text start="190.42" dur="4.22">number of people that are unemployed</text>
  <text start="191.92" dur="6.69">just from the Fed and government</text>
  <text start="194.64" dur="6.879">changing calculations on how they gauge</text>
  <text start="198.61" dur="6.33">how the economy is doing is the first</text>
  <text start="201.519" dur="6.631">sign that lets us know that things are</text>
  <text start="204.94" dur="6">an illusion I mean when the calculations</text>
  <text start="208.15" dur="5.1">change to make it better for their</text>
  <text start="210.94" dur="5.01">reporting and better for the mainstream</text>
  <text start="213.25" dur="4.92">media so those people who don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="215.95" dur="5.03">anything about you know what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="218.17" dur="4.95">going on they just here quick numbers</text>
  <text start="220.98" dur="4.42">over the media and they feel</text>
  <text start="223.12" dur="5.1">everything&amp;#39;s fine oops stock markets up</text>
  <text start="225.4" dur="5.01">unemployment is low or remaining steady</text>
  <text start="228.22" dur="3.989">gp&amp;#39;s fine inflation is not happening</text>
  <text start="230.41" dur="3.77">everything looks fantastic is all</text>
  <text start="232.209" dur="5.461">everything looks good but when you look</text>
  <text start="234.18" dur="7.119">beyond that and you look at companies</text>
  <text start="237.67" dur="7.53">and you look at other factors that are</text>
  <text start="241.299" dur="7.141">going on you see that everything is not</text>
  <text start="245.2" dur="6.8">okay I mean for instance UPS just</text>
  <text start="248.44" dur="6.329">slashed their earnings I mean for a</text>
  <text start="252" dur="4.9">slowing us industrial economy drove</text>
  <text start="254.769" dur="4.981">revenue and operating profit below</text>
  <text start="256.9" dur="5.13">expectations ups experienced some</text>
  <text start="259.75" dur="7.01">slowing in package volume growth as a</text>
  <text start="262.03" dur="7.819">result of labor negotiations now again</text>
  <text start="266.76" dur="7.439">we have to think of it this way</text>
  <text start="269.849" dur="7.29">there is every time the economy and the</text>
  <text start="274.199" dur="7.62">stock market starts separating company&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="277.139" dur="7.17">earnings seem to take a dive and a lot</text>
  <text start="281.819" dur="5.761">of times fedex and UPS are good</text>
  <text start="284.309" dur="7.021">indicators because companies retail</text>
  <text start="287.58" dur="6.66">shipping that all starts to decline and</text>
  <text start="291.33" dur="5.549">I think we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot more of</text>
  <text start="294.24" dur="6.739">this and with the corporate earnings</text>
  <text start="296.879" dur="7.05">coming out I think we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="300.979" dur="4.87">real some really bad news and of course</text>
  <text start="303.929" dur="4.47">the mainstream media will spin it into</text>
  <text start="305.849" dur="4.55">good news the market will rise because</text>
  <text start="308.399" dur="5.24">every won&amp;#39;t be expecting more QE and</text>
  <text start="310.399" dur="8.591">everything should be okay at that point</text>
  <text start="313.639" dur="10.45">but consumer confidence is mrs. for the</text>
  <text start="318.99" dur="6.81">first time in 2013 and it this goes on</text>
  <text start="324.089" dur="3.87">to say in an odd reversal of recent</text>
  <text start="325.8" dur="4.379">trends the future expectations sub-index</text>
  <text start="327.959" dur="6.83">of the you Mitch consumer confidence</text>
  <text start="330.179" dur="9.181">survey fell as the current rose notably</text>
  <text start="334.789" dur="7.24">is hope fading perhaps it is the spike</text>
  <text start="339.36" dur="7.139">in gas prices or the spike in mortgage</text>
  <text start="342.029" dur="9.18">rates I mean we have to look around fuel</text>
  <text start="346.499" dur="6.15">right now oil prices are moving up there</text>
  <text start="351.209" dur="4.14">up to I think it&amp;#39;s around one hundred</text>
  <text start="352.649" dur="4.5">and six dollars per barrel of oil right</text>
  <text start="355.349" dur="4.141">now so we&amp;#39;re going to see at the pumps</text>
  <text start="357.149" dur="5.88">we&amp;#39;re going to be approaching four</text>
  <text start="359.49" dur="6.839">dollars per gallon at the pumps the way</text>
  <text start="363.029" dur="6.66">it&amp;#39;s going and every day that we if you</text>
  <text start="366.329" dur="5.52">look at the the price of oil its</text>
  <text start="369.689" dur="6.51">continually going up every single day</text>
  <text start="371.849" dur="8.641">and you know when when the prices of oil</text>
  <text start="376.199" dur="9.59">go up the price of gallon per gallon</text>
  <text start="380.49" dur="10.469">goes up which affects food delivery and</text>
  <text start="385.789" dur="6.97">package delivery it affects a lot so you</text>
  <text start="390.959" dur="4.47">know people who have to shell out more</text>
  <text start="392.759" dur="4.89">money for all of this yeah the</text>
  <text start="395.429" dur="5.941">confidence will be sinking and and</text>
  <text start="397.649" dur="6.091">moving downward and maybe this is why</text>
  <text start="401.37" dur="4.829">we&amp;#39;re saying this or maybe</text>
  <text start="403.74" dur="6.959">because more people are becoming</text>
  <text start="406.199" dur="7.081">unemployed maybe because people have are</text>
  <text start="410.699" dur="5.011">not getting the bonuses or that they</text>
  <text start="413.28" dur="4.109">used to get maybe because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="415.71" dur="3.959">they&amp;#39;re not getting the raises they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="417.389" dur="5.84">getting I mean it could be many many</text>
  <text start="419.669" dur="7.321">different factors that go into this but</text>
  <text start="423.229" dur="11.011">it&amp;#39;s a definite sign that something is</text>
  <text start="426.99" dur="10.459">happening now Detroit is you know</text>
  <text start="434.24" dur="9.16">collapsing it&amp;#39;s declaring bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="437.449" dur="12.511">it&amp;#39;s you know all around terrible there</text>
  <text start="443.4" dur="11.48">and this could be a template of how</text>
  <text start="449.96" dur="9.579">pensions will be accessed to fund or</text>
  <text start="454.88" dur="8.439">help with failing cities across the</text>
  <text start="459.539" dur="8.041">nation and this article goes on to say</text>
  <text start="463.319" dur="7.261">that you know this could be America&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="467.58" dur="6.839">canary in the coal mine signaling what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="470.58" dur="6.45">to come for the rest of the country with</text>
  <text start="474.419" dur="5.011">the threat of a city bankruptcy looming</text>
  <text start="477.03" dur="5.129">destroyed city workers and retirees are</text>
  <text start="479.43" dur="5.31">pushing back against the state-appointed</text>
  <text start="482.159" dur="4.621">emergency manager filing lawsuits to</text>
  <text start="484.74" dur="4.229">limit his options are refusing to accept</text>
  <text start="486.78" dur="4.59">demands to keep details of their</text>
  <text start="488.969" dur="4.431">discussion secret the plan if enacted</text>
  <text start="491.37" dur="5.31">would be expected to result in</text>
  <text start="493.4" dur="5.609">significant cuts in pension payments all</text>
  <text start="496.68" dur="5.43">this although the city currently lists</text>
  <text start="499.009" dur="6.101">640 3.7 million in unfunded pension</text>
  <text start="502.11" dur="6.529">liabilities or in his report said the</text>
  <text start="505.11" dur="8.91">number is closer closer to 3.5 billion</text>
  <text start="508.639" dur="10.51">and if they do cut the pension payments</text>
  <text start="514.02" dur="6.75">to people it will make it very hard for</text>
  <text start="519.149" dur="5.491">them to live because they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="520.77" dur="5.46">receiving less money but again we have</text>
  <text start="524.64" dur="3.84">to see how they&amp;#39;re going to structure</text>
  <text start="526.23" dur="5.099">this and I especially with those people</text>
  <text start="528.48" dur="6.66">who are not collecting pensions and and</text>
  <text start="531.329" dur="6.421">what I think what might happen just like</text>
  <text start="535.14" dur="7.62">we saw the balance in Cyprus</text>
  <text start="537.75" dur="8.1">they always try to make it so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="542.76" dur="5.58">always seems better for the person so</text>
  <text start="545.85" dur="5.67">let&amp;#39;s say you have a pension plan one</text>
  <text start="548.34" dur="5.88">way they could you know take your money</text>
  <text start="551.52" dur="5.28">from your pension is to say we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="554.22" dur="5.16">to replace those funds with Treasury</text>
  <text start="556.8" dur="5.7">bonds and we will take your money out of</text>
  <text start="559.38" dur="6">your pension and we&amp;#39;ll put a Treasury</text>
  <text start="562.5" dur="6.12">bond in its place now this solves the</text>
  <text start="565.38" dur="5.58">problem of getting the Treasury bonds</text>
  <text start="568.62" dur="5.34">away from the Fed and putting it back on</text>
  <text start="570.96" dur="6.84">to the people but we can see how this</text>
  <text start="573.96" dur="9.9">can be used and how they can tailor this</text>
  <text start="577.8" dur="9.14">type of beylin type of scenario where</text>
  <text start="583.86" dur="7.07">they can bail out cities that are having</text>
  <text start="586.94" dur="7.09">problems or are right on the edge of</text>
  <text start="590.93" dur="6.28">bankruptcy and a lot of these cities who</text>
  <text start="594.03" dur="5.61">have implemented trakone ian laws like</text>
  <text start="597.21" dur="9.84">New York City Maryland Connecticut New</text>
  <text start="599.64" dur="11.1">Jersey Illinois California Colorado I</text>
  <text start="607.05" dur="8.37">mean all these places are struggling and</text>
  <text start="610.74" dur="7.62">they&amp;#39;re very close to collapse and these</text>
  <text start="615.42" dur="6.63">are the states that are mostly creating</text>
  <text start="618.36" dur="5.46">these gun laws creating all these</text>
  <text start="622.05" dur="3.539">different type of laws of you know</text>
  <text start="623.82" dur="4.26">telling your neighbor if you see a gun</text>
  <text start="625.589" dur="5.25">and you you think it&amp;#39;s illegal you get</text>
  <text start="628.08" dur="5.88">500 bucks the police are going around</text>
  <text start="630.839" dur="5.25">frisking people without any probable</text>
  <text start="633.96" dur="4.83">cause completely violating the Fourth</text>
  <text start="636.089" dur="7.081">Amendment and you see this happening in</text>
  <text start="638.79" dur="7.62">every single state that is very close</text>
  <text start="643.17" dur="6.419">and it has a very huge population center</text>
  <text start="646.41" dur="6.66">and we&amp;#39;re seeing this and Detroit you</text>
  <text start="649.589" dur="5.851">know from what comes out of this each</text>
  <text start="653.07" dur="5.31">city can look at this and if they you</text>
  <text start="655.44" dur="5.399">know create something just like in</text>
  <text start="658.38" dur="5.34">Cyprus it could be used for each city</text>
  <text start="660.839" dur="5.941">all around the country and I can</text>
  <text start="663.72" dur="5.73">definitely see them saying ok to save</text>
  <text start="666.78" dur="4.599">the city to save the the country and I</text>
  <text start="669.45" dur="4.329">mean the states and our cities</text>
  <text start="671.379" dur="5.19">what we need to do is we need to take</text>
  <text start="673.779" dur="5.58">your pensions and I believe Jim Rogers</text>
  <text start="676.569" dur="4.71">is also has said that they will be</text>
  <text start="679.359" dur="5.58">coming after your pensions and I can see</text>
  <text start="681.279" dur="7.56">them making a case where you know they</text>
  <text start="684.939" dur="8.4">just trade your your pension money for</text>
  <text start="688.839" dur="6.92">Treasury bonds I mean it would be a very</text>
  <text start="693.339" dur="4.95">simple thing for them to pull off and</text>
  <text start="695.759" dur="3.88">everyone be like oh okay for those</text>
  <text start="698.289" dur="3.45">people who don&amp;#39;t know any better who are</text>
  <text start="699.639" dur="4.17">not receiving their retirement yet say</text>
  <text start="701.739" dur="3.57">oh okay that sounds fair enough let me</text>
  <text start="703.809" dur="3.42">take a Treasury bond because it&amp;#39;s backed</text>
  <text start="705.309" dur="3.15">by The Full Faith you know of the United</text>
  <text start="707.229" dur="4.35">States government so we&amp;#39;re not to worry</text>
  <text start="708.459" dur="5.28">about that and you can take some of my</text>
  <text start="711.579" dur="5.16">money that&amp;#39;s not a big deal and but</text>
  <text start="713.739" dur="5.94">again what are you really getting you</text>

  <text start="751.989" dur="4.981">article came out and it said we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="753.909" dur="6.03">updated our projection for when treasury</text>
  <text start="756.97" dur="4.769">will exhaust its extra extraordinary</text>
  <text start="759.939" dur="4.65">measures that will allow it to borrow</text>
  <text start="761.739" dur="4.74">under the current debt ceiling we now</text>

  <text start="1313.549" dur="4.35">they actually did have chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="1315.32" dur="4.349">and they use them in New York this will</text>
  <text start="1317.899" dur="4.86">make the point of why we need to go to</text>

  <text start="1330.98" dur="3.9">now there could be many other things</text>
  <text start="1332.539" dur="5.101">there could be a dirty bomb</text>
  <text start="1334.88" dur="6.51">or some other type of explosions going</text>
  <text start="1337.64" dur="6.15">off around the country but again they</text>
  <text start="1341.39" dur="4.92">need something big they need something</text>

  <text start="1349.16" dur="7.92">going on and see why we need to get into</text>
  <text start="1354.59" dur="5.07">Syria now of course all the people who</text>
  <text start="1357.08" dur="4.05">see this and hear it on the news as CNN</text>
  <text start="1359.66" dur="6.15">continually repeated and repeats and</text>
  <text start="1361.13" dur="7.56">repeats it the people will be begging to</text>
  <text start="1365.81" dur="6.72">go into Syria because what they have</text>
  <text start="1368.69" dur="6.18">done and again we will all know that</text>
  <text start="1372.53" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s not true and this is why we need to</text>
  <text start="1374.87" dur="4.86">continually spread the word and report</text>
  <text start="1377.24" dur="5.13">because the more people that know that</text>

  <text start="1382.37" dur="6.6">by the FBI by whatever agency there is</text>
  <text start="1386.45" dur="5.76">and the more people that know about this</text>
  <text start="1388.97" dur="7.17">the less impact it has on us and it</text>
  <text start="1392.21" dur="6.78">working basically okay let&amp;#39;s move on</text>

  <text start="1430.25" dur="6.36">this will eventually turn into old or</text>
  <text start="1432.53" dur="7.08">three then we also have Japan who now</text>
  <text start="1436.61" dur="5.67">will go it alone if they decide that</text>
  <text start="1439.61" dur="6.84">china is doing something and they will</text>

  <text start="1446.45" dur="7.07">of the United States and we see all of</text>
  <text start="1451.22" dur="4.83">this happening all at the same time and</text>
  <text start="1453.52" dur="5.26">this will eventually turn into world war</text>

  <text start="1475.25" dur="6.45">to cover up what they have done and</text>
  <text start="1478.809" dur="5.141">eventually when all everything is said</text>
  <text start="1481.7" dur="5.04">and done they will be able to start a</text>
