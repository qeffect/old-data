  <text start="53.06" dur="6.83">hi and welcome you listening to the x-22</text>
  <text start="56.78" dur="6.529">report my name is Dave and zip sewed</text>
  <text start="59.89" dur="6.1">1517 a and today&amp;#39;s date is March 9th</text>
  <text start="63.309" dur="6.341">2018 and the title of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.99" dur="6.39">POTUS will ask the people do we need the</text>
  <text start="69.65" dur="5.25">Fed let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="72.38" dur="5.07">financial news now as we know since</text>
  <text start="74.9" dur="5.31">Trump came into office nothing has</text>
  <text start="77.45" dur="4.52">really changed in the economy yes Trump</text>
  <text start="80.21" dur="3.9">has been doing many different things</text>
  <text start="81.97" dur="4.24">around the world trying to bring</text>
  <text start="84.11" dur="4.56">manufacturing back to the states</text>
  <text start="86.21" dur="5.1">implemented tariffs reciprocal taxes</text>
  <text start="88.67" dur="6.809">draining the deep swamp doing a lot of</text>
  <text start="91.31" dur="7.53">things but the underlying economy that</text>
  <text start="95.479" dur="5.221">was there before has not changed</text>
  <text start="98.84" dur="4.889">remember the central banking system is</text>
  <text start="100.7" dur="4.86">still controlling the economy of course</text>
  <text start="103.729" dur="5.011">they can&amp;#39;t control how many stores stay</text>
  <text start="105.56" dur="5.79">open how people spend their money but</text>
  <text start="108.74" dur="5.16">they can control pretty much everything</text>
  <text start="111.35" dur="6.299">else and they do have the control right</text>
  <text start="113.9" dur="5.579">now now after seven straight months of</text>
  <text start="117.649" dur="3.181">growth wholesale sales tumbled in</text>
  <text start="119.479" dur="4.681">January this is the worst drop since</text>
  <text start="120.83" dur="6.33">2016 we&amp;#39;re also seeing that the housing</text>
  <text start="124.16" dur="6.87">market is having a problem and the</text>
  <text start="127.16" dur="7.02">problem is liquidity a liquidity crisis</text>
  <text start="131.03" dur="5.789">in the housing is on the way now non</text>
  <text start="134.18" dur="4.55">banks are at the center of this storm</text>
  <text start="136.819" dur="4.081">now the Brookings Institute says a</text>
  <text start="138.73" dur="5.26">liquidity crisis in the mortgage market</text>
  <text start="140.9" dur="4.05">is headed our way I mean it&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="143.99" dur="4.14">right at us</text>
  <text start="144.95" dur="6.66">now non banks they originate about half</text>
  <text start="148.13" dur="6.78">of all the mortgages in 2016 and 75% of</text>
  <text start="151.61" dur="7.53">mortgages are insured by the FHA or VA</text>
  <text start="154.91" dur="5.64">and this is a problem and when we start</text>
  <text start="159.14" dur="7.05">to look at what has been going on here</text>
  <text start="160.55" dur="9.36">the big banks have basically shifted and</text>
  <text start="166.19" dur="6">they have allowed the non banks to</text>
  <text start="169.91" dur="5.01">originate most of the mortgages now if</text>
  <text start="172.19" dur="5.22">we go back prior to 2008 it was actually</text>
  <text start="174.92" dur="4.77">the opposite and we know that the Fed</text>
  <text start="177.41" dur="3.48">they had to buy up all this toxic real</text>
  <text start="179.69" dur="3.84">estate this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="180.89" dur="6.03">unwind right now and this is very</text>
  <text start="183.53" dur="5.31">difficult to do because you got to find</text>
  <text start="186.92" dur="5.28">you know investors that are going to</text>
  <text start="188.84" dur="7.35">purchase these and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="192.2" dur="7.08">if we look closely at these non-bank</text>
  <text start="196.19" dur="5.84">companies we see there are problems and</text>
  <text start="199.28" dur="6.209">there&amp;#39;s going to be huge problems now</text>
  <text start="202.03" dur="5.32">there&amp;#39;s a lot of stress on Ginnie Mae</text>
  <text start="205.489" dur="5.821">operations from their non-bank</text>
  <text start="207.35" dur="6">counterparties and basically what the</text>
  <text start="211.31" dur="5.73">Brookings Institute came out with was it</text>
  <text start="213.35" dur="6.27">says today&amp;#39;s almost two-thirds of Ginnie</text>
  <text start="217.04" dur="4.47">Mae guaranteed securities are issued by</text>
  <text start="219.62" dur="4.47">independent mortgage banks and</text>
  <text start="221.51" dur="4.32">independent mortgage bankers are using</text>
  <text start="224.09" dur="4.44">some of the most sophisticated financial</text>
  <text start="225.83" dur="5.4">engineering that this industry has ever</text>
  <text start="228.53" dur="4.17">seen or are also seeing greater</text>
  <text start="231.23" dur="3.93">dependence on credit lines</text>
  <text start="232.7" dur="5.43">securitization involving multiple</text>
  <text start="235.16" dur="5.22">players and more frequent trading of</text>
  <text start="238.13" dur="3.72">servicing rights and all these things</text>
  <text start="240.38" dur="3.96">that have created a new and challenging</text>
  <text start="241.85" dur="4.949">environment for Ginnie Mae in other</text>
  <text start="244.34" dur="5.22">words the risk is a lot higher and</text>
  <text start="246.799" dur="5.22">business models of our issuers are a lot</text>
  <text start="249.56" dur="4.799">more complex add in sharply higher</text>
  <text start="252.019" dur="5.881">annual volumes and these risks are</text>
  <text start="254.359" dur="6.241">amplified many times over also we have</text>
  <text start="257.9" dur="4.829">depended on sheer luck luck that the</text>
  <text start="260.6" dur="5.28">economy does not fall into a recession</text>
  <text start="262.729" dur="4.861">and increase mortgage delinquencies luck</text>
  <text start="265.88" dur="3.72">that our independent mortgage bankers</text>
  <text start="267.59" dur="4.8">remain able to access their line of</text>
  <text start="269.6" dur="6">credit and luck that nothing critical</text>
  <text start="272.39" dur="6.45">falls through the cracks and once this</text>
  <text start="275.6" dur="6.87">does happen where we have a credit</text>
  <text start="278.84" dur="6.66">problem where we enter a recession well</text>
  <text start="282.47" dur="5.009">guess what we&amp;#39;re gonna see that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.5" dur="6.51">going to be a problem in this area and</text>
  <text start="287.479" dur="6.781">again the big banks have been pushing</text>
  <text start="292.01" dur="4.89">this on to the non banks and letting</text>
  <text start="294.26" dur="4.71">them pick up the slack because they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="296.9" dur="3.12">seen what has happened the last time and</text>
  <text start="298.97" dur="1.59">they don&amp;#39;t want this to happen to</text>
  <text start="300.02" dur="2.63">themselves</text>
  <text start="300.56" dur="5.06">once again when this whole thing hits</text>
  <text start="302.65" dur="5.23">now non banks are vulnerable to</text>
  <text start="305.62" dur="4.12">macroeconomic shocks rising interest</text>
  <text start="307.88" dur="4.44">rates what is the Fed doing right now</text>
  <text start="309.74" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re raising the interest rates home</text>
  <text start="312.32" dur="4.38">price declines we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="314.12" dur="5.769">home prices starting to decline and job</text>
  <text start="316.7" dur="4.899">losses now</text>
  <text start="319.889" dur="5.25">this is happening while debt-to-income</text>
  <text start="321.599" dur="6.09">ratios are on the rise and median FICO</text>
  <text start="325.139" dur="3.99">scores are dropping this is hardly</text>
  <text start="327.689" dur="2.301">surprising given homes are not</text>
  <text start="329.129" dur="4.201">affordable</text>
  <text start="329.99" dur="6.31">Brookings provides the failure hierarchy</text>
  <text start="333.33" dur="5.91">and failure is a given to keep the</text>
  <text start="336.3" dur="4.949">latest bubble going nom banks kept</text>
  <text start="339.24" dur="4.919">lowering and lowering their credit</text>
  <text start="341.249" dur="6.78">standards as home prices kept rising and</text>
  <text start="344.159" dur="8.03">rising this is a recipe for disaster and</text>
  <text start="348.029" dur="6.301">this disaster is right in front of us</text>
  <text start="352.189" dur="6.01">we&amp;#39;re starting to see credit card</text>
  <text start="354.33" dur="7.47">delinquencies well they are priced as if</text>
  <text start="358.199" dur="5.911">they will be paid back they won&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="361.8" dur="5.549">know they won&amp;#39;t and as soon as the</text>
  <text start="364.11" dur="6.089">recession hits default and charge-offs</text>
  <text start="367.349" dur="6.111">will mount in turn this will reduce the</text>
  <text start="370.199" dur="6.03">amounts banks will be willing to lend</text>
  <text start="373.46" dur="4.239">subprime corporations who had had been</text>
  <text start="376.229" dur="3.451">borrowing money quarter after quarter</text>
  <text start="377.699" dur="2.37">will find they are priced out of the</text>
  <text start="379.68" dur="2.849">market</text>
  <text start="380.069" dur="5.07">unable to roll over their debt in a fiat</text>
  <text start="382.529" dur="5.971">credit base global setup this is how the</text>
  <text start="385.139" dur="5.55">were the real world works and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="388.5" dur="5.669">going to see that all of these things</text>
  <text start="390.689" dur="7.171">where they try to use these certain</text>
  <text start="394.169" dur="5.911">strategies to offload the load of</text>
  <text start="397.86" dur="3.119">mortgages and place this over here this</text>
  <text start="400.08" dur="3.239">is almost like the subprime securities</text>
  <text start="400.979" dur="3.93">where they said oh let&amp;#39;s create these</text>
  <text start="403.319" dur="3.27">securities we&amp;#39;ll just take all the</text>
  <text start="404.909" dur="4.171">mortgages throw them in there well say</text>
  <text start="406.589" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re triple-a pensions will purchase</text>
  <text start="409.08" dur="4.949">them they&amp;#39;ll sound really great and</text>
  <text start="411.389" dur="4.921">everything will be fantastic and we find</text>
  <text start="414.029" dur="4.5">out that no this is not true we&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="416.31" dur="7.199">seeing the same thing happen now the Fed</text>
  <text start="418.529" dur="7.95">is out there and a Fed governor came out</text>
  <text start="423.509" dur="6.81">and this is Kansas City Fed president</text>
  <text start="426.479" dur="6.69">Esther George said listen the unwind is</text>
  <text start="430.319" dur="5.22">too slow right now this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="433.169" dur="6.18">seeing what we&amp;#39;re seeing in the market</text>
  <text start="435.539" dur="5.91">what we need to do is we need to speed</text>
  <text start="439.349" dur="7.081">this up and then start raising the rates</text>
  <text start="441.449" dur="8.07">rapidly well this tells me that what</text>
  <text start="446.43" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re doing is not having the effect</text>
  <text start="449.519" dur="3.69">that they really want and this is a</text>
  <text start="451.11" dur="2.7">trial balloon that they&amp;#39;re throwing out</text>
  <text start="453.209" dur="2.421">there to see</text>
  <text start="453.81" dur="3.9">if everyone says yeah let&amp;#39;s do this</text>
  <text start="455.63" dur="3.94">because what they really want to do is</text>
  <text start="457.71" dur="4.2">they want to unwind their balance sheet</text>
  <text start="459.57" dur="3.93">very very quickly raise the interest</text>
  <text start="461.91" dur="4.2">rates now she&amp;#39;s talking about raising</text>
  <text start="463.5" dur="6.54">the interest rates about six times about</text>
  <text start="466.11" dur="5.61">25 basis point each time and they want</text>
  <text start="470.04" dur="4.62">to bring the federal funds rate back up</text>
  <text start="471.72" dur="4.59">over three percent and you know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="474.66" dur="4.14">going to happen if they do this if you</text>
  <text start="476.31" dur="3.93">go back to prior to 2008 they did the</text>
  <text start="478.8" dur="3.119">same thing they started to raise the</text>
  <text start="480.24" dur="4.62">rates very very quickly now of course</text>
  <text start="481.919" dur="4.651">they didn&amp;#39;t start at around zero percent</text>
  <text start="484.86" dur="3.6">they started up a little bit higher but</text>
  <text start="486.57" dur="3.569">here we are at zero percent and they</text>
  <text start="488.46" dur="2.79">want to bring this or very close to zero</text>
  <text start="490.139" dur="2.911">percent and they want to bring this up</text>
  <text start="491.25" dur="3.81">and they want to do it very very quickly</text>
  <text start="493.05" dur="4.56">and they want to unwind very quickly</text>
  <text start="495.06" dur="4.919">which tells me that they&amp;#39;re very nervous</text>
  <text start="497.61" dur="4.44">and afraid that they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="499.979" dur="4.861">have the narrative for this whole thing</text>
  <text start="502.05" dur="4.65">coming crashing down and it looks like</text>
  <text start="504.84" dur="4.5">this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do we</text>
  <text start="506.7" dur="4.26">know that Trump went ahead and got rid</text>
  <text start="509.34" dur="3.629">of the TPP but it looks like 11</text>
  <text start="510.96" dur="5.19">countries they have signed the</text>
  <text start="512.969" dur="6.211">trans-pacific trade deal and this is</text>
  <text start="516.15" dur="4.92">Australia this is Canada Chile Japan</text>
  <text start="519.18" dur="6">Malaysia Mexico New Zealand Peru</text>
  <text start="521.07" dur="7.08">Singapore and Vietnam and once again we</text>
  <text start="525.18" dur="6.45">know why the United States Trump decided</text>
  <text start="528.15" dur="6.99">to drop the TPP because this did not</text>
  <text start="531.63" dur="6.81">benefit the people and remember most of</text>
  <text start="535.14" dur="6.71">these countries are still controlled by</text>
  <text start="538.44" dur="6.96">the deep state by the central bank and</text>
  <text start="541.85" dur="6.43">they&amp;#39;re doing what they were supposed to</text>
  <text start="545.4" dur="5.85">do sign this agreement where they have a</text>
  <text start="548.28" dur="5.64">court system which is above their</text>
  <text start="551.25" dur="5.76">government which allows them to make the</text>
  <text start="553.92" dur="5.669">laws this is part of the one-world</text>
  <text start="557.01" dur="6.39">government because the governments are</text>
  <text start="559.589" dur="5.25">no longer in control then now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="563.4" dur="4.71">very interesting I&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="564.839" dur="6.391">how Trump has Andrew Jackson hanging in</text>
  <text start="568.11" dur="8.07">his office where Andrew Jackson got rid</text>
  <text start="571.23" dur="9.57">of the central banking system and one of</text>
  <text start="576.18" dur="8.93">cue announced posts talked about how to</text>
  <text start="580.8" dur="6.69">cut the wires how to defuse a bomb and</text>
  <text start="585.11" dur="5.89">we needed the knowledge</text>
  <text start="587.49" dur="5.61">of which wires or strings to cut cutting</text>
  <text start="591" dur="6.779">the wires and the puppet master strings</text>
  <text start="593.1" dur="7.14">is the real mission of Trump yes he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="597.779" dur="3.991">going to drain the swamp but you need to</text>
  <text start="600.24" dur="6.32">go to the source and we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="601.77" dur="7.61">about that and the real mission is</text>
  <text start="606.56" dur="5.17">getting rid of the central bank the</text>
  <text start="609.38" dur="4.06">central bankers the global</text>
  <text start="611.73" dur="4.29">internationalist the New World Order</text>
  <text start="613.44" dur="5.7">crowd including the Council on Foreign</text>
  <text start="616.02" dur="7.879">Relations these are the wires and</text>
  <text start="619.14" dur="7.86">strings we need to cut president Trump</text>
  <text start="623.899" dur="4.601">he&amp;#39;s going to ask the people if we</text>
  <text start="627" dur="3.75">really need the Federal Reserve should</text>
  <text start="628.5" dur="5.55">we pull out of the United Nations and</text>
  <text start="630.75" dur="7.11">the International Monetary Fund would we</text>
  <text start="634.05" dur="8.25">ever tolerate international law imposed</text>
  <text start="637.86" dur="7.229">on us by The Hague basically what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="642.3" dur="6.03">going to do is he&amp;#39;s going to drop the</text>
  <text start="645.089" dur="7.261">Fed and of course it always comes back</text>
  <text start="648.33" dur="6.96">to the people if the people decide yes</text>
  <text start="652.35" dur="7.16">this is the right thing to do he will do</text>
  <text start="655.29" dur="9.57">this this is what q continually says</text>
  <text start="659.51" dur="9.37">what happens if he drops the Fed what</text>
  <text start="664.86" dur="5.82">happens if the Fed no longer controls</text>
  <text start="668.88" dur="6.329">the economic system now think about this</text>
  <text start="670.68" dur="11.49">for a second all those Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="675.209" dur="10.971">notes what happens well they are no</text>
  <text start="682.17" dur="7.35">longer currency for us think about JFK</text>
  <text start="686.18" dur="7.48">he tried to issue a silver certificate</text>
  <text start="689.52" dur="6.89">it was issued by the Treasury put it out</text>
  <text start="693.66" dur="6.66">into circulation the central bankers</text>
  <text start="696.41" dur="6.7">deep state got rid of them and all that</text>
  <text start="700.32" dur="4.92">currency was completely wiped off the</text>
  <text start="703.11" dur="7.41">face of the earth and the central</text>
  <text start="705.24" dur="6.81">banking system kept on going once we get</text>
  <text start="710.52" dur="3.689">rid of the Federal Reserve Note and I do</text>
  <text start="712.05" dur="5.13">believe this is why we have the $100</text>
  <text start="714.209" dur="5.671">bill because it is split in half on one</text>
  <text start="717.18" dur="4.199">side it says the Federal Reserve Note on</text>
  <text start="719.88" dur="4.919">the other side</text>
  <text start="721.379" dur="6.531">to do with gold and the it&amp;#39;s a US</text>
