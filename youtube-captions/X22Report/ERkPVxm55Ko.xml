  <text start="96.32" dur="4.87">individuals within the Fed there&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="98.82" dur="4.62">guys there&amp;#39;s bad guys they are now</text>
  <text start="101.19" dur="4.8">fighting amongst themselves about the</text>
  <text start="103.44" dur="6.92">interest rates about what they should do</text>
  <text start="105.99" dur="8.01">now this was the plan it was to divide</text>
  <text start="110.36" dur="5.41">those individuals within the Fed and we</text>
  <text start="114" dur="4.35">could see it happening right in front of</text>
  <text start="115.77" dur="5.34">our eyes now remember this is just part</text>
  <text start="118.35" dur="6.09">of the plan the bigger plan is to bring</text>
  <text start="121.11" dur="5.94">down and reset the entire system and</text>
  <text start="124.44" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s not just the economic system it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="127.05" dur="3.56">the government and everything else</text>
  <text start="129" dur="4.83">remember what Q said this is not about</text>
  <text start="130.61" dur="5.489">fixing a Fed economy or little things</text>
  <text start="133.83" dur="6">here or there or a four-year election</text>
  <text start="136.099" dur="5.231">this is about undoing everything the</text>
  <text start="139.83" dur="4.29">central banks and the deep state have</text>
  <text start="141.33" dur="3.299">have put into place over the many many</text>
  <text start="144.12" dur="4.02">years</text>
  <text start="144.629" dur="8.041">and the only way to do this is to bring</text>
  <text start="148.14" dur="7.59">it all down at once and you need to make</text>
  <text start="152.67" dur="5.52">sure that all the pieces are in place to</text>
  <text start="155.73" dur="4.349">drop the hammer you can&amp;#39;t continually</text>
  <text start="158.19" dur="5.49">drop the hammer over and over and over</text>
  <text start="160.079" dur="5.001">you need to make sure that everything is</text>
  <text start="163.68" dur="5.42">in place for that ham</text>
  <text start="165.08" dur="6.81">to come down and one of the things they</text>
  <text start="169.1" dur="5.79">need to do is they need to destroy the</text>
  <text start="171.89" dur="6.48">central bank system and that is to</text>
  <text start="174.89" dur="6.24">destroy the central bank economy this is</text>
  <text start="178.37" dur="6.24">why we see the economy right now falling</text>
  <text start="181.13" dur="6.36">apart yes the statistical number is like</text>
  <text start="184.61" dur="5.25">stock market unemployment and everything</text>
  <text start="187.49" dur="6.57">else yeah you can manipulate that any</text>
  <text start="189.86" dur="5.85">way you want it seems great but when you</text>
  <text start="194.06" dur="3.45">really look at what&amp;#39;s going on here you</text>
  <text start="195.71" dur="3.63">can see that it&amp;#39;s absolutely falling</text>
  <text start="197.51" dur="4.32">apart why do you think Jim Cramer The</text>
  <text start="199.34" dur="4.77">Wall Street Journal CNBC they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="201.83" dur="4.77">telling the Fed hey slow down the</text>
  <text start="204.11" dur="4.68">interest rates don&amp;#39;t raise the rates we</text>
  <text start="206.6" dur="4.89">see what&amp;#39;s happening here and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="208.79" dur="4.44">going to be good they&amp;#39;re doing this on</text>
  <text start="211.49" dur="5.58">purpose and there are individuals within</text>
  <text start="213.23" dur="5.28">the Fed that are now fighting about the</text>
  <text start="217.07" dur="3.33">interest rates well maybe we shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="218.51" dur="3.6">raise them once again maybe we are near</text>
  <text start="220.4" dur="3.27">that neutral point maybe and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="222.11" dur="4.849">be talking about this a little bit later</text>
  <text start="223.67" dur="6.12">in this report but when we look at the</text>
  <text start="226.959" dur="4.78">economy when we look at that housing</text>
  <text start="229.79" dur="5.34">market we&amp;#39;re starting to see things</text>
  <text start="231.739" dur="5.611">really start to fall apart now new home</text>
  <text start="235.13" dur="4.94">sales they&amp;#39;ve been plummeting home</text>
  <text start="237.35" dur="6.98">builders stocks they are declining</text>
  <text start="240.07" dur="7.75">existing home sales they are declining</text>
  <text start="244.33" dur="5.17">we have reached the next US housing</text>
  <text start="247.82" dur="4.169">crisis many people don&amp;#39;t realize this</text>
  <text start="249.5" dur="4.65">but here we are because existing home</text>
  <text start="251.989" dur="6.331">sales right now they posted their</text>
  <text start="254.15" dur="7.05">biggest decline in four years and a lot</text>
  <text start="258.32" dur="5.91">of people don&amp;#39;t realize that we are</text>
  <text start="261.2" dur="4.469">headed towards this housing crisis there</text>
  <text start="264.23" dur="3.33">are many people out there who are trying</text>
  <text start="265.669" dur="3.181">to sell their houses they think that the</text>
  <text start="267.56" dur="4.05">housing market is still going up</text>
  <text start="268.85" dur="5.19">everything is still fantastic but</text>
  <text start="271.61" dur="3.89">they&amp;#39;re gonna see as they did in 2008</text>
  <text start="274.04" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re gonna be chasing the market</text>
  <text start="275.5" dur="5.169">things are turning right now I mean</text>
  <text start="277.94" dur="5.039">remember the survey that we talked about</text>
  <text start="280.669" dur="5.641">maybe two or three reports ago that just</text>
  <text start="282.979" dur="7.371">13% of all Americans plan to purchase a</text>
  <text start="286.31" dur="6.93">home during the next year only 13% I</text>
  <text start="290.35" dur="6.37">mean that is just ridiculous I mean</text>
  <text start="293.24" dur="4.86">think about why only 13% of the people</text>
  <text start="296.72" dur="3.63">are looking to purchase a home</text>
  <text start="298.1" dur="3.87">as they watch the interest rates move up</text>
  <text start="300.35" dur="3.72">and up and up and their salaries</text>
  <text start="301.97" dur="4.14">probably stay stagnant and they see</text>
  <text start="304.07" dur="4.05">inflation they&amp;#39;re starting to realize</text>
  <text start="306.11" dur="5.43">that they&amp;#39;re being pushed out of the</text>
  <text start="308.12" dur="6.72">market and they do have to wait until</text>
  <text start="311.54" dur="6.12">things get better so they can purchase a</text>
  <text start="314.84" dur="4.02">home and this is why more and more</text>
  <text start="317.66" dur="2.85">people are going to be pushed out and</text>
  <text start="318.86" dur="5.52">you&amp;#39;re gonna see this number going down</text>
  <text start="320.51" dur="4.92">to 10 percent 9 percent 8 percent but we</text>
  <text start="324.38" dur="4.05">need to remember something very</text>
  <text start="325.43" dur="5.55">important all of this is happening for a</text>
  <text start="328.43" dur="4.2">specific reason the reason this is</text>
  <text start="330.98" dur="3.42">happening is because the economy is</text>
  <text start="332.63" dur="4.08">being pushed to the edge it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="334.4" dur="5.31">pushed to the edge on purpose to destroy</text>
  <text start="336.71" dur="5.7">the central bank system now in the</text>
  <text start="339.71" dur="4.67">meantime while this is being done Trump</text>
  <text start="342.41" dur="6.3">has been working be in the background</text>
  <text start="344.38" dur="7">getting the economy the US economy the</text>
  <text start="348.71" dur="6.96">people&amp;#39;s economy ready for this</text>
  <text start="351.38" dur="7.43">transition trying to implement new trade</text>
  <text start="355.67" dur="5.61">deals trying to bring back manufacturing</text>
  <text start="358.81" dur="4.36">doing many different things canceling</text>
  <text start="361.28" dur="4.02">the globalist trade systems and</text>
  <text start="363.17" dur="4.62">everything else that we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="365.3" dur="5.46">for the Med for the last many many years</text>
  <text start="367.79" dur="5.25">and he&amp;#39;s trying to do all this within a</text>
  <text start="370.76" dur="3.72">very short period of time and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="373.04" dur="2.79">believe that Trump and the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="374.48" dur="4.89">working alone I think he&amp;#39;s working with</text>
  <text start="375.83" dur="5.61">Xi Jingping Putin and the rest and we</text>
  <text start="379.37" dur="4.11">could see already that Trump and the</text>
  <text start="381.44" dur="3.69">Chinese leader Xi Jinping they have</text>
  <text start="383.48" dur="4.08">indicated they&amp;#39;re both ready for a</text>
  <text start="385.13" dur="5.01">highly anticipated meeting at the group</text>
  <text start="387.56" dur="4.74">of 20 summit in Argentina next week and</text>
  <text start="390.14" dur="4.71">I do believe when these two leaders get</text>
  <text start="392.3" dur="6.21">together they&amp;#39;re gonna hammer out trade</text>
  <text start="394.85" dur="7.08">deals and they&amp;#39;re going to put both</text>
  <text start="398.51" dur="5.94">countries on a path for economic</text>
  <text start="401.93" dur="4.92">prosperity now a lot of this has to do</text>
  <text start="404.45" dur="4.71">with getting rid of the central bank</text>
  <text start="406.85" dur="6">because if the central bank is involved</text>
  <text start="409.16" dur="6.63">there will be no economic prosperity so</text>
  <text start="412.85" dur="6.6">China hopes to meet the u.s. halfway in</text>
  <text start="415.79" dur="5.72">addressing trade issues china says</text>
  <text start="419.45" dur="5.01">reforms on the World Trade Organization</text>
  <text start="421.51" dur="6.969">should also be addressed within the</text>
  <text start="424.46" dur="7.1">global trade body remember the WTO that</text>
  <text start="428.479" dur="6.091">is a central bank organization</text>
  <text start="431.56" dur="4.93">what we see China doing right now is the</text>
  <text start="434.57" dur="4.74">same thing that the US is doing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="436.49" dur="6.03">making bilateral trade agreements not</text>
  <text start="439.31" dur="5.37">global trade agreements I mean China and</text>
  <text start="442.52" dur="4.62">Spain they&amp;#39;re gonna chart a new roadmap</text>
  <text start="444.68" dur="4.58">for bilateral relations China and</text>
  <text start="447.14" dur="5.04">Portugal will sign unspecified deals</text>
  <text start="449.26" dur="5.92">China Argentina will sign five-year plan</text>
  <text start="452.18" dur="5.4">for future cooperation China and Panama</text>
  <text start="455.18" dur="4.62">will sign agreements u.s. is doing the</text>
  <text start="457.58" dur="3.57">same exact thing all this is being</text>
  <text start="459.8" dur="4.37">prepared and getting and they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="461.15" dur="4.74">ready for the belt and road trade system</text>
  <text start="464.17" dur="4.09">everything&amp;#39;s going to be interconnected</text>
  <text start="465.89" dur="3.81">and there&amp;#39;s going to be all and all of</text>
  <text start="468.26" dur="3.57">this is going to be bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="469.7" dur="4.32">agreements Trump right now if you</text>
  <text start="471.83" dur="3.66">noticed is making bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="474.02" dur="3.66">agreements actually doing the same thing</text>
  <text start="475.49" dur="6">that China&amp;#39;s doing both countries are</text>
  <text start="477.68" dur="6.63">doing the same exact thing and all this</text>
  <text start="481.49" dur="4.02">is in preparation to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="484.31" dur="3.87">central bank and what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="485.51" dur="5.76">about all this is that Trump was out</text>
  <text start="488.18" dur="5.97">there and he was contradicting the World</text>
  <text start="491.27" dur="5.01">Trade Organization would like to redo</text>
  <text start="494.15" dur="5.37">the World Trade Organization and now Xi</text>
  <text start="496.28" dur="7.35">Jinping is out there saying the same</text>
  <text start="499.52" dur="8.82">exact thing now Bank of America is out</text>
  <text start="503.63" dur="10.83">there and they&amp;#39;re saying that the Fed is</text>
  <text start="508.34" dur="10.08">in a panic and they are in a panic why</text>
  <text start="514.46" dur="5.57">well the bad guys don&amp;#39;t like what is</text>
  <text start="518.42" dur="5.99">happening right now</text>
  <text start="520.03" dur="8.14">Powell is pushing the interest rates up</text>
  <text start="524.41" dur="6.13">Mendy the Fed heads of the different</text>
  <text start="528.17" dur="4.74">feds around the country don&amp;#39;t like this</text>
  <text start="530.54" dur="4.65">because they know if he continually does</text>
  <text start="532.91" dur="7.86">this the entire system falls apart I</text>
  <text start="535.19" dur="7.89">mean if we go back to 1982 well we saw</text>
  <text start="540.77" dur="6.69">that the US Fed Funds rate was around</text>
  <text start="543.08" dur="5.97">20% when it hit that area guess what the</text>
  <text start="547.46" dur="6.39">whole thing fell apart we entered a</text>
  <text start="549.05" dur="9.27">recession back in 1987 same thing we hit</text>
  <text start="553.85" dur="7.14">a all-time high of 10% for the feds fund</text>
  <text start="558.32" dur="6.35">rate and all of a sudden everything fell</text>
  <text start="560.99" dur="8.15">apart if we go back to oh seven</text>
  <text start="564.67" dur="9.59">we hit around almost 6% and everything</text>
  <text start="569.14" dur="7.11">fell apart now if you notice from 1980</text>
  <text start="574.26" dur="4.3">to the present day</text>
  <text start="576.25" dur="4.5">interest rates each time they raised</text>
  <text start="578.56" dur="4.89">them only could hit a certain point in</text>
  <text start="580.75" dur="5.01">82 that was the highest it was you know</text>
  <text start="583.45" dur="4.14">18 19 20 percent around that time period</text>
  <text start="585.76" dur="4.8">remember we came off the gold standard</text>
  <text start="587.59" dur="7.68">back in 71 the interest rates went up</text>
  <text start="590.56" dur="7.74">during these periods back in 71 they hit</text>
  <text start="595.27" dur="5.85">around 6% 74 they hit around 1011</text>
  <text start="598.3" dur="7.47">percent and then the 80s they hit around</text>
  <text start="601.12" dur="5.37">18 19 20 % then after that everything</text>
  <text start="605.77" dur="3.66">started to fall</text>
  <text start="606.49" dur="3.9">remember the central bank system doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="609.43" dur="2.43">last forever</text>
  <text start="610.39" dur="3.9">yes in the beginning stages it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="611.86" dur="5.55">fantastic because you see inflation</text>
  <text start="614.29" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re creating currency you get a bump</text>
  <text start="617.41" dur="4.14">in housing prices you get a bump in</text>
  <text start="619.15" dur="4.77">salary you get a bump everywhere you see</text>
  <text start="621.55" dur="5.85">interest rates moving up you make a lot</text>
  <text start="623.92" dur="6.18">off of your savings your CDs and things</text>
  <text start="627.4" dur="4.17">like that once we hit a middle ground</text>
  <text start="630.1" dur="4.38">point where everything starts to even</text>
  <text start="631.57" dur="4.74">out everything starts to reverse very</text>
  <text start="634.48" dur="4.56">slowly in the beginning but then it</text>
  <text start="636.31" dur="5.64">speeds up at the end so at 8 from 1982</text>
  <text start="639.04" dur="5.52">onward we see the interest rates where</text>
  <text start="641.95" dur="7.11">18 19 20 % around that range and then</text>
  <text start="644.56" dur="10.86">boom 87 we only hit 10 boom 2000 we only</text>
  <text start="649.06" dur="10.05">hit 8 2007 boom only 6% now the rate can</text>
  <text start="655.42" dur="7.35">only hit 3% before everything falls</text>
  <text start="659.11" dur="5.07">apart now the Fed is panicking and we</text>
  <text start="662.77" dur="4.26">can see this out of the New York Post</text>
  <text start="664.18" dur="5.01">and they wrote this article the Fed</text>
  <text start="667.03" dur="5.1">cannot agree on what they&amp;#39;re doing about</text>
  <text start="669.19" dur="5.01">interest rates hmm very interesting so</text>
  <text start="672.13" dur="5.1">when we look at this we can see the</text>
  <text start="674.2" dur="4.77">problems here Fair Reserve Chairman</text>
  <text start="677.23" dur="3.75">Jerome Powell said recently that the</text>
  <text start="678.97" dur="4.02">interest rates are a long way from</text>
  <text start="680.98" dur="4.74">neutral remember they have to get 3%</text>
  <text start="682.99" dur="4.77">around that target area and the right</text>
  <text start="685.72" dur="5.22">and the rates might even have to go</text>
  <text start="687.76" dur="5.46">beyond neutral hmm that is very</text>
  <text start="690.94" dur="4.26">interesting neutrals the point where</text>
  <text start="693.22" dur="4.54">borrowing costs are neither helping nor</text>
  <text start="695.2" dur="5.56">hurting the economy but</text>
  <text start="697.76" dur="4.14">Richard Clarita the feds vice-chairman</text>
  <text start="700.76" dur="2.67">claims that their rates are already</text>
  <text start="701.9" dur="4.29">close to neutral</text>
  <text start="703.43" dur="4.47">then there&amp;#39;s Charles Evans who is in</text>
  <text start="706.19" dur="3.48">charge of the Chicago Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="707.9" dur="4.35">Bank he said this week that the Fed</text>
  <text start="709.67" dur="6.66">needs to raise interest rates other Fed</text>
  <text start="712.25" dur="7.29">officials have also spoken up in various</text>
  <text start="716.33" dur="6.21">degrees of specificity on both sides of</text>
  <text start="719.54" dur="5.97">the issue Fed heads are starting to take</text>
  <text start="722.54" dur="5.52">sides they cannot agree there&amp;#39;s a battle</text>
  <text start="725.51" dur="6">forming inside the Fed now between the</text>
  <text start="728.06" dur="6.3">good guys and the bad guys and you can</text>
  <text start="731.51" dur="5.43">see this is not just happening out in</text>
  <text start="734.36" dur="4.71">the Fed where you see the good guys in</text>
  <text start="736.94" dur="5.87">the bad guys you see it in government</text>
  <text start="739.07" dur="7.05">you see it in the intelligence</text>
  <text start="742.81" dur="5.77">organizations like the FBI and the CIA</text>
  <text start="746.12" dur="4.49">and the rest you see it everywhere</text>
  <text start="748.58" dur="4.95">because right now there&amp;#39;s a division</text>
  <text start="750.61" dur="6.7">between the good guys and the bad guys</text>
  <text start="753.53" dur="7.65">there&amp;#39;s a huge battle going on between</text>
  <text start="757.31" dur="7.11">these sides and they&amp;#39;re both trying to</text>
  <text start="761.18" dur="6.45">control the situation but as you can see</text>
  <text start="764.42" dur="5.25">the good guys they have the control the</text>
  <text start="767.63" dur="4.05">bad guys are trying to hit back but the</text>
  <text start="769.67" dur="4.11">good guys are controlling what is</text>
  <text start="771.68" dur="4.08">happening right now and if you look at</text>
  <text start="773.78" dur="5.22">the Fed right now who is in control</text>
  <text start="775.76" dur="4.86">right now Jerome Powell who was most</text>
  <text start="779" dur="4.02">likely working with Trump Trump put him</text>
  <text start="780.62" dur="5.25">in the position and if you notice what</text>
  <text start="783.02" dur="5.4">Powell said he&amp;#39;s gonna continually raise</text>
  <text start="785.87" dur="7.98">their rates and might even go further</text>
  <text start="788.42" dur="8.37">past the neutral point of 3% now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="793.85" dur="6">very interesting because that will then</text>
  <text start="796.79" dur="7.53">really bring down the entire economic</text>
  <text start="799.85" dur="6.45">system we&amp;#39;ve seen it in the past we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="804.32" dur="4.08">seen it every single time they hit a</text>
  <text start="806.3" dur="4.59">certain point and then they drop the</text>
  <text start="808.4" dur="4.92">rates like there&amp;#39;s no tomorrow I mean he</text>
  <text start="810.89" dur="5.46">just comes straight down which tells us</text>
  <text start="813.32" dur="5.25">that they&amp;#39;re preparing to bring this</text>
  <text start="816.35" dur="5.13">entire system down and they want to make</text>
  <text start="818.57" dur="5.04">sure that it crashes and crashes hard</text>
  <text start="821.48" dur="4.41">they just can&amp;#39;t have a small little</text>
  <text start="823.61" dur="4.23">correction they just can&amp;#39;t have it go</text>
  <text start="825.89" dur="4.17">into a you know a little recession and</text>
  <text start="827.84" dur="3.66">everything is fine after that and we do</text>
  <text start="830.06" dur="3.87">the same thing over and over again</text>
  <text start="831.5" dur="4.23">remember what Q says this is not about a</text>
  <text start="833.93" dur="4.26">four-year election this is not about</text>
  <text start="835.73" dur="6.84">fixing anything this is about resetting</text>
  <text start="838.19" dur="6.84">the entire system sure we set the entire</text>
  <text start="842.57" dur="5.48">system to get everyone pointing to the</text>
  <text start="845.03" dur="6.48">Fed to get everyone pissed off and angry</text>
  <text start="848.05" dur="5.77">you go after their wallets when people</text>
  <text start="851.51" dur="5.49">are hit in their wallets and they see</text>
  <text start="853.82" dur="6.89">savings they see you know their life&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="857" dur="7.23">earnings disappear overnight</text>
  <text start="860.71" dur="7.15">people become angry and when people are</text>
  <text start="864.23" dur="5.4">angry they point the finger and already</text>
  <text start="867.86" dur="3.75">we can see that narrative is being set</text>
  <text start="869.63" dur="3.39">up remember to get out of this central</text>
  <text start="871.61" dur="3.69">bank system this is not going to be an</text>
  <text start="873.02" dur="4.2">easy thing this is gonna be difficult</text>
  <text start="875.3" dur="4.68">for many people if you look back in</text>
  <text start="877.22" dur="6.51">history many people get hurt going</text>
  <text start="879.98" dur="6.09">through this type of transition and this</text>
  <text start="883.73" dur="6.56">is why we&amp;#39;ve been saying prepare for it</text>
  <text start="886.07" dur="7.17">get gold get silver learn how to trade</text>
  <text start="890.29" dur="4.96">purchase crypto currencies everything</text>
  <text start="893.24" dur="4.38">the central bank hates everything that</text>
  <text start="895.25" dur="4.31">they suppress those are the things that</text>
  <text start="897.62" dur="4.23">you should be looking at right now and</text>
  <text start="899.56" dur="4.45">you could see that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="901.85" dur="4.23">suppressing for a very long time gold</text>
  <text start="904.01" dur="4.16">and silver you can see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="906.08" dur="4.53">suppressing crypto currencies right now</text>
  <text start="908.17" dur="3.34">with paper contracts they&amp;#39;ve just been</text>
  <text start="910.61" dur="3.479">dumping Everett</text>
  <text start="911.51" dur="5.37">all of it and you see right now that</text>
  <text start="914.089" dur="4.201">they continually do this now of course</text>
  <text start="916.88" dur="2.82">you have to have cash on him because</text>
  <text start="918.29" dur="3.84">when you go through this you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="919.7" dur="4.41">need cash to use during this period</text>
  <text start="922.13" dur="3.45">because you&amp;#39;re gonna see inflation and</text>
  <text start="924.11" dur="2.97">the value of the dollar is going to</text>
  <text start="925.58" dur="4.44">decrease decrease decrease so you want</text>
  <text start="927.08" dur="5.009">to use that first so as we go through</text>
  <text start="930.02" dur="3.39">this you need to be prepared for this</text>
  <text start="932.089" dur="4.831">those people that were prepared back</text>
  <text start="933.41" dur="6.929">during 1929 that held on to their gold</text>
  <text start="936.92" dur="5.73">that had silver guess what as soon as</text>
  <text start="940.339" dur="5.431">the government received enough gold they</text>
  <text start="942.65" dur="4.59">upped the price from $20 to $35 so those</text>
  <text start="945.77" dur="4.05">people that held on to their gold and</text>
  <text start="947.24" dur="5.61">silver they made out during that time</text>
  <text start="949.82" dur="5.16">period and the same thing is gonna</text>
  <text start="952.85" dur="4.17">happen once again when the system</text>
  <text start="954.98" dur="4.95">collapses those people holding the gold</text>
  <text start="957.02" dur="6.15">silver crypto currencies and everything</text>
  <text start="959.93" dur="4.71">else they are going to make out those</text>
  <text start="963.17" dur="4.38">people that kept their</text>
  <text start="964.64" dur="5.22">cash in the banks well remember we still</text>
  <text start="967.55" dur="3.59">have those bail-in documents we still</text>
  <text start="969.86" dur="4.41">have the problems with the banks</text>
  <text start="971.14" dur="8.08">remember this is a central bank currency</text>
  <text start="974.27" dur="7.56">system and if the dollar right now has</text>
  <text start="979.22" dur="4.77">lost 98 percent of the value what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="981.83" dur="6">gonna happen when the system implodes</text>
  <text start="983.99" dur="6.24">and countries start to dump the petro</text>
  <text start="987.83" dur="4.38">dollar from their reserves</text>
  <text start="990.23" dur="3.21">well those dollars are gonna flow back</text>
  <text start="992.21" dur="2.79">here and that means it&amp;#39;s gonna be a lot</text>
  <text start="993.44" dur="3.48">more dollars in circulation and that</text>
  <text start="995" dur="4.32">means the dollar is going to lose value</text>
  <text start="996.92" dur="5.82">even further so we see what is happening</text>
  <text start="999.32" dur="4.44">here we just all need to be prepared for</text>
