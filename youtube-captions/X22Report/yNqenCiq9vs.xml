  <text start="61.58" dur="5.7">August 27th 2018 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="64.519" dur="5.251">episode is as the u.s. approaches a</text>
  <text start="67.28" dur="5.67">death cross the good guys prepare the</text>
  <text start="69.77" dur="5.849">economic transition let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="72.95" dur="5.46">economic collapse financial news now how</text>
  <text start="75.619" dur="5.821">do you know when you&amp;#39;re hitting at the</text>
  <text start="78.41" dur="5.76">heart of the central bank well the</text>
  <text start="81.44" dur="5.64">central bank of all central bank&amp;#39;s comes</text>
  <text start="84.17" dur="5.63">out of the darkness behind the curtain</text>
  <text start="87.08" dur="5.52">and they come out and they say listen</text>
  <text start="89.8" dur="6.849">everything that Trump is doing is going</text>
  <text start="92.6" dur="6.299">to hurt the global economy and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="96.649" dur="3.631">already hearing from the business the</text>
  <text start="98.899" dur="3.601">Bank of International Settlements</text>
  <text start="100.28" dur="4.89">and you can see that they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="102.5" dur="6.03">nervous about what is going on here</text>
  <text start="105.17" dur="7.41">because they realize that they&amp;#39;re about</text>
  <text start="108.53" dur="5.43">to be taken down and they can see what</text>
  <text start="112.58" dur="4.039">is happening around the world and</text>
  <text start="113.96" dur="6.63">remember they spent many many years</text>
  <text start="116.619" dur="6.911">creating this system building it because</text>
  <text start="120.59" dur="5.04">they thought in their minds that this</text>
  <text start="123.53" dur="4.41">entire planet was going to be controlled</text>
  <text start="125.63" dur="5.219">by them that we were going to have a</text>
  <text start="127.94" dur="5.73">one-world government a one currency</text>
  <text start="130.849" dur="4.891">system which they controlled everyone</text>
  <text start="133.67" dur="5.88">was going to be slaves and working for</text>
  <text start="135.74" dur="6.3">them this was the major plan and now</text>
  <text start="139.55" dur="5.64">everything is falling apart and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="142.04" dur="6.39">speaking out against what is happening</text>
  <text start="145.19" dur="7.56">and that&amp;#39;s how you know that they know</text>
  <text start="148.43" dur="7.11">that the clock is ticking down but what</text>
  <text start="152.75" dur="5.94">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now in the economy is</text>
  <text start="155.54" dur="7.08">a complete breakdown of the entire</text>
  <text start="158.69" dur="6.87">economic system and yes Trump needs to</text>
  <text start="162.62" dur="5.82">keep everyone aware of how great the</text>
  <text start="165.56" dur="6.21">economy is doing this is part of the</text>
  <text start="168.44" dur="6.21">strategy they are using they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="171.77" dur="5.37">the same strategy the enemy has been</text>
  <text start="174.65" dur="5.55">using for all these years think about it</text>
  <text start="177.14" dur="5.1">go back in time every time the economy</text>
  <text start="180.2" dur="3.84">went into recession what was the central</text>
  <text start="182.24" dur="3.68">bank always telling us what was the</text>
  <text start="184.04" dur="5.57">mainstream media always telling us</text>
  <text start="185.92" dur="6.36">how great the economy is how fantastic</text>
  <text start="189.61" dur="4.709">it is look at this stock market this is</text>
  <text start="192.28" dur="3.63">exactly what Trump is doing right now</text>
  <text start="194.319" dur="3.541">and if you look at what happened with</text>
  <text start="195.91" dur="4.079">North Korea and many other things you</text>
  <text start="197.86" dur="3.87">can see that he&amp;#39;s continually using this</text>
  <text start="199.989" dur="5.311">strategy using everything that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="201.73" dur="4.38">done in the past to push this new agenda</text>
  <text start="205.3" dur="3.48">forward</text>
  <text start="206.11" dur="4.26">so just because he&amp;#39;s out they are saying</text>
  <text start="208.78" dur="2.789">that the economy is doing great look at</text>
  <text start="210.37" dur="3.21">these numbers because this is what they</text>
  <text start="211.569" dur="3.39">always did look at our GDP numbers look</text>
  <text start="213.58" dur="4.77">at the stock market look how great</text>
  <text start="214.959" dur="6">everything is he&amp;#39;s using this against</text>
  <text start="218.35" dur="5.28">them and they don&amp;#39;t know what to do at</text>
  <text start="220.959" dur="5.491">this point because when everything</text>
  <text start="223.63" dur="6.63">starts to fall apart he&amp;#39;s going to say</text>
  <text start="226.45" dur="5.52">look I made the economy great it was</text>
  <text start="230.26" dur="3.809">better than it&amp;#39;s ever made before it the</text>
  <text start="231.97" dur="4.65">GDP numbers are double unemployment is</text>
  <text start="234.069" dur="5.581">the lowest we&amp;#39;ve ever seen what has the</text>
  <text start="236.62" dur="4.74">central bank done and this is what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="239.65" dur="4.29">getting prepared for not just him all</text>
  <text start="241.36" dur="5.159">the people that are supporting everyone</text>
  <text start="243.94" dur="4.98">that is in motion everyone that is doing</text>
  <text start="246.519" dur="6.211">all of this they are prepared and ready</text>
  <text start="248.92" dur="7.59">and this is not just the US it&amp;#39;s China</text>
  <text start="252.73" dur="5.58">it&amp;#39;s Russia all working together and</text>
  <text start="256.51" dur="3.93">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="258.31" dur="4.859">seeing the yield curve and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="260.44" dur="5.039">flattening and it looks like we might</text>
  <text start="263.169" dur="5.011">even get to an inverted yield curve and</text>
  <text start="265.479" dur="5.731">this is why some individuals in the Fed</text>
  <text start="268.18" dur="7.38">wanted to change the way we calculate</text>
  <text start="271.21" dur="8.37">the yield curve now the yield curve</text>
  <text start="275.56" dur="7.74">right now is the flattest since August</text>
  <text start="279.58" dur="7.38">of 2007 well you know what happened in</text>
  <text start="283.3" dur="5.01">2008 going into 2009 we were in a</text>
  <text start="286.96" dur="3.57">recession actually we&amp;#39;re in a recession</text>
  <text start="288.31" dur="3.6">way before that but again they look at</text>
  <text start="290.53" dur="3.42">the stock market and they tell you you</text>
  <text start="291.91" dur="4.98">know later on when it were actually</text>
  <text start="293.95" dur="5.64">started so we are now seeing a</text>
  <text start="296.89" dur="4.95">flattening yield curve where short term</text>
  <text start="299.59" dur="5.52">yields and long term yields move closer</text>
  <text start="301.84" dur="5.85">together now unless the 10-year yield</text>
  <text start="305.11" dur="5.88">gets on the rate hike bandwagon and</text>
  <text start="307.69" dur="6.39">jumps it might soon be lower than the</text>
  <text start="310.99" dur="6.48">two-year yield a condition called a</text>
  <text start="314.08" dur="5.339">yield curve inversion this happens as</text>
  <text start="317.47" dur="2.43">shorter term yields rise following the</text>
  <text start="319.419" dur="3.121">feds</text>
  <text start="319.9" dur="4.98">hikes but long term yields refused to</text>
  <text start="322.54" dur="5.04">budge and then we get an inversion so</text>
  <text start="324.88" dur="6.45">we&amp;#39;re on an inversion watch right now</text>
  <text start="327.58" dur="8.399">and once the spread between the two year</text>
  <text start="331.33" dur="7.38">in the ten year move past zero that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="335.979" dur="5.881">when we hit the inversion right now</text>
  <text start="338.71" dur="6.39">we&amp;#39;re at point one nine and if we go</text>
  <text start="341.86" dur="6.119">back in time to like 2016 we were at one</text>
  <text start="345.1" dur="5.28">point two five if we go back to 2013 we</text>
  <text start="347.979" dur="5.371">were at two point five so here we are</text>
  <text start="350.38" dur="5.24">already we&amp;#39;re on inversion watch and if</text>
  <text start="353.35" dur="7.41">this drops below zero</text>
  <text start="355.62" dur="8.53">we&amp;#39;re in trouble it&amp;#39;s game over and the</text>
  <text start="360.76" dur="6">yield curve flattens when the Fed</text>
  <text start="364.15" dur="8.1">started to raise rates if we go back in</text>
  <text start="366.76" dur="8.339">time and we look at December 14 2016 all</text>
  <text start="372.25" dur="7.169">of a sudden we saw the US Treasury yield</text>
  <text start="375.099" dur="5.16">curve start to flatten so we see that</text>
  <text start="379.419" dur="2.97">it&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="380.259" dur="5.19">we know that the economy&amp;#39;s in trouble</text>
  <text start="382.389" dur="5.131">and we can see this from what is</text>
  <text start="385.449" dur="6.621">happening with the US economic data</text>
  <text start="387.52" dur="7.67">which is the death cross remember global</text>
  <text start="392.07" dur="6.879">synchronous recovering well that&amp;#39;s over</text>
  <text start="395.19" dur="6.13">for the first time since early 2015 US</text>
  <text start="398.949" dur="4.921">economic data is trending dramatically</text>
  <text start="401.32" dur="6.15">more disappointing than that of Europe</text>
  <text start="403.87" dur="6">in fact as the global synchronous</text>
  <text start="407.47" dur="5.04">recovery evaporates US and European</text>
  <text start="409.87" dur="5.46">economic data has not been so completely</text>
  <text start="412.51" dur="5.909">decoupled and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is the</text>
  <text start="415.33" dur="5.43">EU macro surprise index and the US macro</text>
  <text start="418.419" dur="3.87">surprise surprise index it looks like</text>
  <text start="420.76" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;re headed towards a death course and</text>
  <text start="422.289" dur="5.641">every time we&amp;#39;ve seen this guess what</text>
  <text start="424.18" dur="7.29">happens we enter a recession here we are</text>
  <text start="427.93" dur="5.76">once again headed in that way now the</text>
  <text start="431.47" dur="4.979">Bank of International Settlements and</text>
  <text start="433.69" dur="4.409">not just the biz but the IMF and the</text>
  <text start="436.449" dur="3.9">rest of the central bankers they see</text>
  <text start="438.099" dur="5.461">what is happening here and they do not</text>
  <text start="440.349" dur="6.991">like it whatsoever the general manager</text>
  <text start="443.56" dur="7.229">of the biz warned the greater risk is</text>
  <text start="447.34" dur="5.189">not how many points of GDP the rising</text>
  <text start="450.789" dur="2.581">tariffs will subtract from the US and</text>
  <text start="452.529" dur="3.751">China but</text>
  <text start="453.37" dur="4.829">growing danger to globalization itself</text>
  <text start="456.28" dur="4.169">and he went on to say reversing</text>
  <text start="458.199" dur="5.521">globalization could increase prices</text>
  <text start="460.449" dur="7.321">raise unemployment and crimp growth</text>
  <text start="463.72" dur="7.29">higher tariffs could actually just say</text>
  <text start="467.77" dur="5.64">would drive up US inflation and force</text>
  <text start="471.01" dur="5.159">the Fed to raise rates driving up the</text>
  <text start="473.41" dur="5.55">dollar and hurting both US exports and</text>
  <text start="476.169" dur="6.421">emerging market economies in the process</text>
  <text start="478.96" dur="5.76">he said protectionism also threatens to</text>
  <text start="482.59" dur="4.44">unsettle financial markets and put a</text>
  <text start="484.72" dur="5.009">drag on firms capital spending as</text>
  <text start="487.03" dur="6.06">investors take fright and financial</text>
  <text start="489.729" dur="5.881">conditions tighten these real and</text>
  <text start="493.09" dur="5.97">financial risks could amplify each other</text>
  <text start="495.61" dur="6.96">creating a perfect storm and exacting an</text>
  <text start="499.06" dur="5.91">even higher price basically the central</text>
  <text start="502.57" dur="3.93">bank is out there saying listen what</text>
  <text start="504.97" dur="3.93">Trump is doing and what the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="506.5" dur="5.969">doing right now they are going to unwind</text>
  <text start="508.9" dur="5.759">everything that we did and globalization</text>
  <text start="512.469" dur="4.861">is gonna fall by the wayside and our</text>
  <text start="514.659" dur="3.75">system the central banking system this</text>
  <text start="517.33" dur="3.57">is remembered this is not a people</text>
  <text start="518.409" dur="5.611">system this is their system that they</text>
  <text start="520.9" dur="5.61">created and if you go back to 1913</text>
  <text start="524.02" dur="6.63">that&amp;#39;s when it all started their system</text>
  <text start="526.51" dur="6.99">is going to fail they do not like this</text>
  <text start="530.65" dur="5.58">this is why they&amp;#39;re out there screaming</text>
  <text start="533.5" dur="5.4">and yelling warning the world that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="536.23" dur="4.41">all going to come crashing down well</text>
  <text start="538.9" dur="4.17">sometimes things need to come crashing</text>
  <text start="540.64" dur="4.92">down so we can rebuild it the right way</text>
  <text start="543.07" dur="4.8">now the good guys Trump in the Patriots</text>
  <text start="545.56" dur="5.07">they are trying to prepare everything</text>
  <text start="547.87" dur="5.1">for this transition and what we need to</text>
  <text start="550.63" dur="4.59">do is we need to get out of all these</text>
  <text start="552.97" dur="3.93">trade deals that the central bank of the</text>
  <text start="555.22" dur="3.21">deep states set up this was for</text>
  <text start="556.9" dur="2.879">globalization that was the only reason</text>
  <text start="558.43" dur="3.45">they were doing this they were taking</text>
  <text start="559.779" dur="4.531">different steps like NAFTA the next big</text>
  <text start="561.88" dur="5.85">one was TPP which is struck down NAFTA</text>
  <text start="564.31" dur="5.73">now was renegotiated and it&amp;#39;s renamed</text>
  <text start="567.73" dur="5.16">right now and you could see it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="570.04" dur="4.32">United States Mexico trade agreement now</text>
  <text start="572.89" dur="2.97">Trump couldn&amp;#39;t get rid of it all</text>
  <text start="574.36" dur="3.06">together because I had to go through</text>
  <text start="575.86" dur="3">Congress and it was going to take a very</text>
  <text start="577.42" dur="2.88">long time and what they normally do with</text>
  <text start="578.86" dur="3.599">these trade agreements they make it so</text>
  <text start="580.3" dur="4.23">intertwined so you just can&amp;#39;t come in</text>
  <text start="582.459" dur="5.391">and say okay we don&amp;#39;t want this anymore</text>
  <text start="584.53" dur="7.68">but the deal was a noun</text>
  <text start="587.85" dur="6.73">today that US and Mexico had reached a</text>
  <text start="592.21" dur="4.59">new deal that would govern they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="594.58" dur="4.71">totally out of whack trade relationship</text>
  <text start="596.8" dur="5.31">and Trump came out and said you know</text>
  <text start="599.29" dur="5.94">it&amp;#39;s a big deal looking good with Mexico</text>
  <text start="602.11" dur="6.63">and got rid of the name NAFTA now</text>
  <text start="605.23" dur="5.52">remember when they created NAFTA they</text>
  <text start="608.74" dur="3.9">told us it was going to bring jobs to</text>
  <text start="610.75" dur="5.1">the u.s. it was going to be beneficial</text>
  <text start="612.64" dur="7.29">for the US and the whole entire</text>
  <text start="615.85" dur="7.29">agreement was based around wages through</text>
  <text start="619.93" dur="5.25">the automobile manufacturers and what</text>
  <text start="623.14" dur="5.46">they thought was going to happen was</text>
  <text start="625.18" dur="5.82">they were going to allow Mexico and this</text>
  <text start="628.6" dur="4.35">is what their plan was which was never</text>
  <text start="631" dur="5.37">going to happen they were going to let</text>
  <text start="632.95" dur="6.54">the population rise up to the level of</text>
  <text start="636.37" dur="7.11">the United States and once the</text>
  <text start="639.49" dur="6.17">population in wages rose up to the level</text>
  <text start="643.48" dur="5.73">of the United States the automobile</text>
  <text start="645.66" dur="6.73">workers in Mexico would be getting paid</text>
  <text start="649.21" dur="5.94">a lot more almost equal to the United</text>
  <text start="652.39" dur="4.95">States which will which would allow the</text>
  <text start="655.15" dur="5.34">United States to keep all the jobs here</text>
  <text start="657.34" dur="6.99">but what really happened well that</text>
  <text start="660.49" dur="7.62">didn&amp;#39;t happen at all the wages were</text>
  <text start="664.33" dur="6.57">suppressed in Mexico think about this</text>
  <text start="668.11" dur="5.9">for a second in Mexico they were</text>
  <text start="670.9" dur="7.44">supposed to bring the jobs there and</text>
  <text start="674.01" dur="7.03">somehow someway they were going to bring</text>
  <text start="678.34" dur="5.46">the way of life of the everyday people</text>
  <text start="681.04" dur="4.43">up to the level of the United States I</text>
  <text start="683.8" dur="3.03">mean does that sound realistic</text>
  <text start="685.47" dur="4.39">absolutely not</text>
  <text start="686.83" dur="5.97">remember GM employs over 15,000</text>
  <text start="689.86" dur="6.44">production workers in Mexico they pay</text>
  <text start="692.8" dur="6.48">workers less than $3 per hour and</text>
  <text start="696.3" dur="7.27">exports over 80% of the vehicles to the</text>
  <text start="699.28" dur="6.36">US to sell here now think about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="703.57" dur="4.68">happening here in the United States the</text>
  <text start="705.64" dur="5.64">UAW GM workers here in the U in the u.s.</text>
  <text start="708.25" dur="6.33">are laid off and unemployed now if we</text>
  <text start="711.28" dur="5.88">look at the US assembly line worker here</text>
  <text start="714.58" dur="4.59">in the US they earn on average twenty</text>
  <text start="717.16" dur="3.659">nine dollars and sixty sixty-two cents</text>
  <text start="719.17" dur="3.99">per hour</text>
  <text start="720.819" dur="5.091">and workers at component makers earn</text>
  <text start="723.16" dur="6.989">around 20 dollars and 81 cents per our</text>
  <text start="725.91" dur="5.949">rising wages in Mexico would squeeze</text>
  <text start="730.149" dur="3.24">profits from those autumn will make</text>
  <text start="731.859" dur="2.51">automobile makers and they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="733.389" dur="3.961">to let that happen</text>
  <text start="734.369" dur="5.02">so Trump really wanted to get rid of</text>
  <text start="737.35" dur="4.919">NAFTA get rid of what was going on there</text>
  <text start="739.389" dur="4.05">and bring the jobs back here and he</text>
  <text start="742.269" dur="3.42">couldn&amp;#39;t do that because it was</text>
  <text start="743.439" dur="4.26">intertwined into Congress Congress would</text>
  <text start="745.689" dur="3.69">have to vote on it and it wasn&amp;#39;t as easy</text>
  <text start="747.699" dur="3.48">as getting rid of TPP because that</text>
  <text start="749.379" dur="3.3">wasn&amp;#39;t really established yet and with</text>
  <text start="751.179" dur="5.34">an executive order he was able to strike</text>
  <text start="752.679" dur="6.2">down TPP but a key provision of the New</text>
  <text start="756.519" dur="5.16">Deal is an increase in the mandated</text>
  <text start="758.879" dur="4.33">locally-sourced auto content from sixty</text>
  <text start="761.679" dur="5.731">two point five percent to seventy five</text>
  <text start="763.209" dur="6.27">percent and that 40% to 45% of auto</text>
  <text start="767.41" dur="5.489">contact would be made by workers earning</text>
  <text start="769.479" dur="5.76">average base wage of $16 per hour now</text>
  <text start="772.899" dur="5.91">according to the US trade rep the new</text>
  <text start="775.239" dur="6">rules will incentivize billions annually</text>
  <text start="778.809" dur="4.14">in additional u.s. vehicle and auto</text>
  <text start="781.239" dur="5.7">parts production and help preserve and</text>
  <text start="782.949" dur="6.6">reshoring distri jobs and investment the</text>
  <text start="786.939" dur="4.8">deal also maintains duty-free access in</text>
  <text start="789.549" dur="4.68">farm products while the countries have</text>
  <text start="791.739" dur="3.84">also agreed to stronger rules of origin</text>
  <text start="794.229" dur="4.02">for industrial products such as</text>
  <text start="795.579" dur="5.43">chemicals steel intensive products class</text>
  <text start="798.249" dur="6.15">an optical fiber the question remains</text>
  <text start="801.009" dur="5.04">what happens now with Canada and it</text>
  <text start="804.399" dur="3.451">looks like they&amp;#39;re going to try to work</text>
  <text start="806.049" dur="5.25">with Canada right now remember this deal</text>
  <text start="807.85" dur="7.319">was only with Mexico NAFTA well that was</text>
  <text start="811.299" dur="6.57">with Canada and Mexico and the u.s. so</text>
  <text start="815.169" dur="4.95">Trump just made a bilateral agreement</text>
  <text start="817.869" dur="4.19">now is this Agreement all said and done</text>
  <text start="820.119" dur="5.34">no I think this is the beginning stages</text>
  <text start="822.059" dur="5.35">Trump says trade deal with Mexico is</text>
  <text start="825.459" dur="5.1">very special for manufacturers and</text>
  <text start="827.409" dur="5.97">farmers Trump pitches us-mexico trade</text>
  <text start="830.559" dur="5.01">deal incredible for workers Trump says</text>
  <text start="833.379" dur="3.78">we could do a separate deal with Canada</text>
  <text start="835.569" dur="4.11">or make them part of the deal with</text>
  <text start="837.159" dur="6.93">Mexico Trump eventually will be able to</text>
  <text start="839.679" dur="6.63">work out a deal with China so we can see</text>
  <text start="844.089" dur="4.65">right now they&amp;#39;re trying to put us in</text>
  <text start="846.309" dur="5.18">the right position for this transition</text>
  <text start="848.739" dur="6.301">and I think as we move forward and</text>
  <text start="851.489" dur="5.53">everything is collapsed and</text>
  <text start="855.04" dur="4.38">and rebuilt I think this trade agreement</text>
  <text start="857.019" dur="4.891">is going to go through many many many</text>
  <text start="859.42" dur="4.74">revisions and we can see already with</text>
  <text start="861.91" dur="4.799">many other countries bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="864.16" dur="5.52">agreements are being worked on right now</text>
  <text start="866.709" dur="4.651">China is making a lot of bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="869.68" dur="3.42">agreements and these bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="871.36" dur="3.959">agreements are outside of the globalist</text>
  <text start="873.1" dur="3.479">system yes in some cases they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="875.319" dur="3.301">controlled by the World Trade</text>
  <text start="876.579" dur="4.531">Organization but we could see already</text>
  <text start="878.62" dur="4.139">Trump already has his eye on that and</text>
  <text start="881.11" dur="3.719">most likely going to get rid of that</text>
  <text start="882.759" dur="5.64">because that is part of the globalist</text>
  <text start="884.829" dur="5.76">system and remember this first stage of</text>
  <text start="888.399" dur="5.94">we working NAFTA doesn&amp;#39;t solve all our</text>
  <text start="890.589" dur="6.391">problems it&amp;#39;s impossible to solve every</text>
  <text start="894.339" dur="4.531">single problem that these deep state</text>
  <text start="896.98" dur="4.2">central bankers have done over the many</text>
  <text start="898.87" dur="5.209">many years within the first two years</text>
  <text start="901.18" dur="6.209">it&amp;#39;s completely impossible and if he was</text>
  <text start="904.079" dur="7.81">an unelected leader like those in the</text>
  <text start="907.389" dur="6.271">ECB where they can push their policies</text>
  <text start="911.889" dur="4.14">on different countries and the countries</text>
  <text start="913.66" dur="4.47">really can&amp;#39;t argue with them he&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="916.029" dur="3.781">able to take his pen write executive</text>
  <text start="918.13" dur="4.889">orders get rid of Obamacare get rid of</text>
  <text start="919.81" dur="4.469">NAFTA get rid of many of the laws but it</text>
  <text start="923.019" dur="3.271">doesn&amp;#39;t work like that way here in the</text>
  <text start="924.279" dur="3.781">United States you still have to go</text>
  <text start="926.29" dur="4.049">through Congress you still have to go</text>
  <text start="928.06" dur="5.31">through other bodies of government to</text>
  <text start="930.339" dur="5.49">get things done and we could see right</text>
  <text start="933.37" dur="5.25">now sometimes you have to take baby</text>
  <text start="935.829" dur="5.161">steps to get into the position that you</text>
  <text start="938.62" dur="4.949">want and then move forward but what</text>
  <text start="940.99" dur="5.73">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is this is in</text>
  <text start="943.569" dur="4.981">preparation for this economic transition</text>
  <text start="946.72" dur="4.109">remember we can&amp;#39;t bring all</text>
  <text start="948.55" dur="3.87">manufacturing back in a snap of a finger</text>
  <text start="950.829" dur="3.541">it&amp;#39;s going to take time it took many</text>
  <text start="952.42" dur="4.349">many years for the central bank in the</text>
  <text start="954.37" dur="4.14">deep state to move them offshore to</text>
  <text start="956.769" dur="3.93">bring them all back and to build the</text>
  <text start="958.51" dur="4.92">infrastructure to get the people trained</text>
  <text start="960.699" dur="5.25">is something quite different and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="963.43" dur="5.279">going to take much longer to do that</text>
  <text start="965.949" dur="4.651">than to move it off shore so we can see</text>
  <text start="968.709" dur="3.57">that this is the beginning stages and</text>
