  <text start="45.3" dur="5.189">Greece is still having discussions with</text>
  <text start="47.19" dur="6.06">the ECB the ECB is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="50.489" dur="5.25">saying listen if you want more money you</text>
  <text start="53.25" dur="5.07">want another loan you&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="55.739" dur="5.221">to implement austerity you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="58.32" dur="4.739">have to show us what you&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="60.96" dur="4.019">now again thus Ariza party ran on the</text>
  <text start="63.059" dur="3.361">platform that they&amp;#39;re going to going to</text>
  <text start="64.979" dur="3.96">get rid of austerity that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="66.42" dur="6.449">going to take on more debt but when we</text>
  <text start="68.939" dur="6.72">look at the Eurogroup they are showing a</text>
  <text start="72.869" dur="4.981">sign that there would be no retreat from</text>
  <text start="75.659" dur="3.57">finalizing an austerity package so</text>
  <text start="77.85" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re not moving away from austerity</text>
  <text start="79.229" dur="4.951">because every time the central bankers</text>
  <text start="81.36" dur="5.759">give you a loan they want you to</text>
  <text start="84.18" dur="6.06">implement austerity they want the in</text>

  <text start="90.24" dur="5.55">the natural resources for pennies on the</text>

  <text start="95.79" dur="6.03">country gets back on its feet or sell it</text>
  <text start="98.04" dur="5.88">to other investors and we can see this</text>
  <text start="101.82" dur="4.95">is exactly what they&amp;#39;re trying to do to</text>
  <text start="103.92" dur="6.39">Greece we see the Surrey sir government</text>
  <text start="106.77" dur="5.279">trying to step away from this and we</text>
  <text start="110.31" dur="4.05">have to continually look at the</text>
  <text start="112.049" dur="4.53">situation and try to understand what</text>
  <text start="114.36" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re doing within these four months</text>
  <text start="116.579" dur="4.14">because they receive four months of</text>
  <text start="118.5" dur="3.63">emergency loans they&amp;#39;ve been talking to</text>
  <text start="120.719" dur="4.711">Russia they&amp;#39;ve been talking to China</text>
  <text start="122.13" dur="6.12">Russia extended a hand by saying listen</text>
  <text start="125.43" dur="5.639">if you leave the eurozone we will remove</text>
  <text start="128.25" dur="4.74">the food ban we understand they redesign</text>
  <text start="131.069" dur="5.431">the drachma</text>
  <text start="132.99" dur="5.01">and they have to be the syriza party has</text>
  <text start="136.5" dur="3.9">to be very careful at this point because</text>
  <text start="138" dur="5.01">if the people see that they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="140.4" dur="5.01">making a deal with the ECB and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="143.01" dur="4.35">going to impose austerity this is going</text>
  <text start="145.41" dur="3.78">to be a huge problem for them but again</text>
  <text start="147.36" dur="4.65">we don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on behind</text>
  <text start="149.19" dur="5.61">closed doors and we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="152.01" dur="5.01">watch this closely but we can see at</text>
  <text start="154.8" dur="7.47">this point the ECB wants them to put</text>
  <text start="157.02" dur="7.83">together an austerity package now we see</text>
  <text start="162.27" dur="5.69">out in Canada and this is starting to</text>
  <text start="164.85" dur="5.4">spread now where it happened back in</text>
  <text start="167.96" dur="4.03">2007-2008 where the housing market</text>
  <text start="170.25" dur="4.88">started to fall apart and other</text>
  <text start="171.99" dur="6.32">countries started to feel it in February</text>
  <text start="175.13" dur="5.53">housing starts in Canada they dropped to</text>
  <text start="178.31" dur="5.83">16.4 percent this is the lowest since</text>
  <text start="180.66" dur="5.46">2009 of course they&amp;#39;re blaming this all</text>
  <text start="184.14" dur="4.32">on the weather it was terrible weather</text>
  <text start="186.12" dur="4.71">this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing this but the</text>
  <text start="188.46" dur="5.73">trend in housing starts decreased for a</text>
  <text start="190.83" dur="5.94">fifth consecutive month in February and</text>
  <text start="194.19" dur="5.87">reflects a decreasing trend in multiple</text>
  <text start="196.77" dur="7.44">starts at chief economist Bob Dugan and</text>
  <text start="200.06" dur="7.47">so this isn&amp;#39;t a fluke we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="204.21" dur="6.87">trend that housing is falling apart</text>
  <text start="207.53" dur="5.74">multi-family urban starts to the hardest</text>
  <text start="211.08" dur="7.56">hit in Canada they have plunged by</text>
  <text start="213.27" dur="9.75">twenty five percent no one is escaping</text>
  <text start="218.64" dur="6.21">this collapse we see that it is</text>
  <text start="223.02" dur="5.04">definitely spreading I mean look at</text>
  <text start="224.85" dur="5.76">target in Canada they closed all their</text>
  <text start="228.06" dur="5.07">stores if the economy is booming and</text>
  <text start="230.61" dur="4.68">expanding and people are going out and</text>
  <text start="233.13" dur="4.71">spending their money they wouldn&amp;#39;t close</text>
  <text start="235.29" dur="7.05">all the stores layoff 70,000 people and</text>
  <text start="237.84" dur="6.69">then cut their funds here in the United</text>
  <text start="242.34" dur="4.5">States and lay off people here in the</text>
  <text start="244.53" dur="5.19">United States and there are additionally</text>
  <text start="246.84" dur="6">closing stores here in the US many</text>
  <text start="249.72" dur="5.97">retailers are going out of business why</text>
  <text start="252.84" dur="5.97">is this well as we know consumer</text>
  <text start="255.69" dur="5.31">spending it&amp;#39;s just not there we talked</text>
  <text start="258.81" dur="4.89">about this people are not purchasing in</text>
  <text start="261" dur="4.26">cash people are not purchasing using</text>
  <text start="263.7" dur="3.21">their credit cards they&amp;#39;re only getting</text>
  <text start="265.26" dur="5.01">what they need to survive</text>
  <text start="266.91" dur="6.42">most of the people don&amp;#39;t have an income</text>
  <text start="270.27" dur="7.46">to support them going out and purchasing</text>
  <text start="273.33" dur="7.62">a new TV a new house a new car</text>
  <text start="277.73" dur="5.35">electronics or anything else so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="280.95" dur="6.06">just going out and doing what is needed</text>
  <text start="283.08" dur="6.24">to survive and we can see by lowering</text>
  <text start="287.01" dur="5.61">the gas prices is we&amp;#39;re on the fourth</text>
  <text start="289.32" dur="5.01">month right now this has not changed</text>
  <text start="292.62" dur="6.06">anything actually the situation has</text>
  <text start="294.33" dur="8.28">gotten worse lower gas prices spending</text>
  <text start="298.68" dur="7.26">has gone down not up it&amp;#39;s gone the</text>
  <text start="302.61" dur="5.45">opposite way the trend in consumer</text>
  <text start="305.94" dur="4.86">spending has slowed across many sectors</text>
  <text start="308.06" dur="5.29">sales and furniture and clothing stores</text>
  <text start="310.8" dur="5.34">have weakened reflecting a decline and</text>
  <text start="313.35" dur="4.5">demand for bigger ticket items so we can</text>
  <text start="316.14" dur="5.06">see that things are not going well and</text>
  <text start="317.85" dur="6.9">we look at companies corporations they</text>
  <text start="321.2" dur="5.16">are laying off people target they</text>
  <text start="324.75" dur="5.33">announced that they&amp;#39;re going to lay off</text>

  <text start="938.689" dur="6.57">privatization but when we look at this</text>
  <text start="942.439" dur="4.95">this has nothing to do with the</text>
  <text start="945.259" dur="5.85">government&amp;#39;s ability to generate revenue</text>

  <text start="958.249" dur="5.25">course they say well yeah if we look at</text>
  <text start="961.309" dur="3.93">the United States they&amp;#39;re able to create</text>
  <text start="963.499" dur="3.87">money and this is why they don&amp;#39;t have a</text>

  <text start="967.369" dur="4.95">bigger problem just like any household</text>
  <text start="969.919" dur="4.71">as you keep continually getting more and</text>

  <text start="976.759" dur="7.62">interest on the debt eventually what</text>
  <text start="981.589" dur="6.96">happens is the country will break down</text>

  <text start="1011.319" dur="5.1">isn&amp;#39;t there to sustain it so what is the</text>
  <text start="1014.769" dur="3.93">government look doing they&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="1016.419" dur="6.831">get more revenue in and they&amp;#39;re running</text>
  <text start="1018.699" dur="8.01">out of places to get it but don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="1023.25" dur="6.819">they&amp;#39;re always thinking of new ideas new</text>
  <text start="1026.709" dur="6.21">ways of bringing in revenue just in case</text>
  <text start="1030.069" dur="8.931">something happens now a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1032.919" dur="9.03">believe that Obama right now is helping</text>
  <text start="1039" dur="7.62">these students with their student loans</text>
  <text start="1041.949" dur="10.891">by giving them a new bankruptcy option</text>
  <text start="1046.62" dur="8.769">but this is no way true basically what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1052.84" dur="6.179">happening right now is that when you</text>
  <text start="1055.389" dur="5.461">have a loan a student loan you are</text>
  <text start="1059.019" dur="3.9">responsible for it and you cannot go</text>
  <text start="1060.85" dur="5.68">bankrupt and get rid of the student loan</text>
  <text start="1062.919" dur="5.501">it is yours and you have to repay it</text>
  <text start="1066.53" dur="3.53">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to modify the loans</text>
  <text start="1068.42" dur="4.8">to help people out because all these</text>
  <text start="1070.06" dur="4.6">kids that are coming out of college they</text>
  <text start="1073.22" dur="3.72">can&amp;#39;t find work they&amp;#39;re finding</text>
  <text start="1074.66" dur="5.85">part-time work but they&amp;#39;re not finding</text>
  <text start="1076.94" dur="6.9">those high-paying jobs and we see the</text>
  <text start="1080.51" dur="6.24">student loan bubble has grown it&amp;#39;s over</text>
  <text start="1083.84" dur="5.22">a trillion dollars right now and we see</text>
  <text start="1086.75" dur="4.67">that nine percent of these students who</text>
  <text start="1089.06" dur="4.62">have these loans are in default and</text>
  <text start="1091.42" dur="3.85">twelve percent of the loans are in</text>
  <text start="1093.68" dur="5.19">deferment and eleven percent in</text>
  <text start="1095.27" dur="8.22">forbearance and it is a risk to the</text>
  <text start="1098.87" dur="6.45">system and if the bubble pops the</text>
  <text start="1103.49" dur="4.14">government the central bank can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="1105.32" dur="3.69">the money anywhere because the people</text>
  <text start="1107.63" dur="4.38">didn&amp;#39;t have the money to pay the loan so</text>
  <text start="1109.01" dur="6.03">they have no money to get at out of them</text>
  <text start="1112.01" dur="5.52">even there&amp;#39;s no way to get it so what</text>
  <text start="1115.04" dur="5.37">Obama and the central bankers decided to</text>
  <text start="1117.53" dur="6.45">do it they said hey let&amp;#39;s give them a</text>
  <text start="1120.41" dur="5.31">bankruptcy option where they can declare</text>
  <text start="1123.98" dur="3.39">bankruptcy and get rid of their student</text>
  <text start="1125.72" dur="3.96">loan yes it helps some of the students</text>
  <text start="1127.37" dur="4.44">but what it&amp;#39;s going to help it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1129.68" dur="3.9">to help the central bank then because</text>
  <text start="1131.81" dur="4.5">when the bubble pops and all these</text>
  <text start="1133.58" dur="6.75">people are going into bankruptcy who can</text>
  <text start="1136.31" dur="6.06">bail out the system now almost like what</text>
  <text start="1140.33" dur="5.16">happened in 2008 with all corporations</text>
  <text start="1142.37" dur="6.12">they were filing bankruptcy who can bail</text>
  <text start="1145.49" dur="5.73">them out at this point the government so</text>
  <text start="1148.49" dur="6.72">this is exactly why they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="1151.22" dur="5.7">at this point it&amp;#39;s kind of makes it seem</text>
  <text start="1155.21" dur="2.94">like they&amp;#39;re helping the students but</text>
  <text start="1156.92" dur="5.7">really what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1158.15" dur="7.2">helping themselves to a new mega bailout</text>
  <text start="1162.62" dur="5.28">system by allowing these people to go</text>
  <text start="1165.35" dur="5.22">bankrupt this is this money then is</text>
  <text start="1167.9" dur="5.61">these that the debt is then freed the</text>
  <text start="1170.57" dur="4.77">taxpayers the government can say okay we</text>
  <text start="1173.51" dur="4.92">need to cover the losses in the student</text>
  <text start="1175.34" dur="5.13">loan now we can issue the money and this</text>
  <text start="1178.43" dur="5.49">is exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing at this</text>
  <text start="1180.47" dur="5.73">point now yesterday we talked about how</text>
  <text start="1183.92" dur="4.56">Obama the central bankers are out there</text>
  <text start="1186.2" dur="3.78">and they&amp;#39;ve been trying for years to ban</text>
  <text start="1188.48" dur="3.78">weapons they&amp;#39;re also trying to ban</text>
  <text start="1189.98" dur="6.63">ammunition right now we talked about how</text>
  <text start="1192.26" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re trying to ban the 556 m855 green</text>
  <text start="1196.61" dur="2.699">tip where they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s a cop</text>
  <text start="1198.17" dur="3.06">killer and</text>
  <text start="1199.309" dur="3.96">we talked about how it was that was</text>
  <text start="1201.23" dur="5.179">never used to kill any cops whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1203.269" dur="5.73">we see that fifty two senators right now</text>
  <text start="1206.409" dur="6.37">have joined to oppose the Obama</text>
  <text start="1208.999" dur="6.51">administration move to ban the ammo and</text>
  <text start="1212.779" dur="7.411">we can see that they&amp;#39;ve written a letter</text>
  <text start="1215.509" dur="7.681">the center said that the 556 m855 green</text>
  <text start="1220.19" dur="5.609">tip cartridge was exempted in the 1986</text>
  <text start="1223.19" dur="4.319">law along with other rifle ammo from</text>
  <text start="1225.799" dur="4.59">bands on armor-piercing rounds the</text>
  <text start="1227.509" dur="5.55">reason popular rifle ammo is not used in</text>
  <text start="1230.389" dur="3.931">shootouts with police they&amp;#39;ve also</text>
  <text start="1233.059" dur="3.45">raised new concerns that the</text>
  <text start="1234.32" dur="5.309">administration is now moving towards</text>
  <text start="1236.509" dur="4.92">other ammunition to ban and we can see</text>
  <text start="1239.629" dur="3.211">they&amp;#39;re heading down this path where</text>
  <text start="1241.429" dur="3.661">they&amp;#39;re going to try to get rid of all</text>
  <text start="1242.84" dur="4.709">the ammo and if you don&amp;#39;t have ammo</text>
  <text start="1245.09" dur="3.449">what&amp;#39;s what can you do with a weapon you</text>
  <text start="1247.549" dur="2.521">there&amp;#39;s nothing you can do with it</text>
  <text start="1248.539" dur="4.71">because you have nothing to put in it to</text>
  <text start="1250.07" dur="4.739">fire so we can see right now they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="1253.249" dur="3.361">there and they&amp;#39;re very concerned about</text>
  <text start="1254.809" dur="5.041">this and they&amp;#39;re saying that the Second</text>
  <text start="1256.61" dur="6.299">Amendment requires not only access to</text>
  <text start="1259.85" dur="6.12">firearms but two bullets listen if if a</text>

  <text start="1265.97" dur="5.159">find rifle ammunition or they face a</text>
  <text start="1269.539" dur="2.85">substantial difficulty in finding</text>
  <text start="1271.129" dur="4.711">ammunition available at reasonable</text>
  <text start="1272.389" dur="6.451">prices because of the government well</text>
  <text start="1275.84" dur="5.069">then the Second Amendment is at risk</text>
  <text start="1278.84" dur="3.809">again we have to look at the second man</text>
  <text start="1280.909" dur="4.26">it says it cannot be infringed upon</text>
  <text start="1282.649" dur="5.01">cannot be limited and this is what the</text>
  <text start="1285.169" dur="5.521">government is trying to do at every</text>
  <text start="1287.659" dur="5.21">single turn because they understand when</text>
  <text start="1290.69" dur="5.64">this system collapses and we know it is</text>
  <text start="1292.869" dur="5.951">we see all the indicators yes they can</text>
  <text start="1296.33" dur="4.469">keep this going for a certain period of</text>
  <text start="1298.82" dur="4.26">time but eventually one day you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1300.799" dur="4.98">to wake up and everyone is going to be</text>
  <text start="1303.08" dur="4.979">completely shocked I know it&amp;#39;s hard to</text>

  <text start="1541.3" dur="7.32">how to shoot them down that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1544.99" dur="5.85">interesting what are they afraid of are</text>
  <text start="1548.62" dur="4.23">they afraid that when this system comes</text>
  <text start="1550.84" dur="4.37">collapsing down that people are going to</text>
  <text start="1552.85" dur="5.49">use their drones to see what&amp;#39;s going on</text>

  <text start="1575.35" dur="5.52">figure out the best way to bring them</text>
  <text start="1577.6" dur="5.7">down so we see them pushing the barriers</text>
  <text start="1580.87" dur="4.53">for all government buildings further and</text>
  <text start="1583.3" dur="4.29">further out because they are using the</text>

  <text start="1674.09" dur="6.87">every country this is what they do and</text>
  <text start="1677.59" dur="7.51">again if we&amp;#39;re having problems in any</text>

  <text start="1700.18" dur="6.1">have anything to do with Venezuela at</text>
  <text start="1702.77" dur="8.54">this time but we know why they are and</text>
  <text start="1706.28" dur="11.79">think about it they&amp;#39;re going on the the</text>
  <text start="1711.31" dur="8.41">the agenda of human rights well don&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="1718.07" dur="3.66">have human rights violations right here</text>
  <text start="1719.72" dur="3.84">in this country what about the black</text>
  <text start="1721.73" dur="4.65">site in Chicago where people are being</text>
  <text start="1723.56" dur="4.74">tortured what about Gitmo gaetano obey</text>

  <text start="1734.42" dur="5.22">just torturing them the same things</text>
  <text start="1737.75" dur="4.71">happen in Chicago and we&amp;#39;re finding out</text>
  <text start="1739.64" dur="4.98">their other sites in Chicago and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1742.46" dur="4.26">sure they&amp;#39;re going to be other ones</text>
  <text start="1744.62" dur="4.05">popping up in all different cities</text>
  <text start="1746.72" dur="6.81">because if once you know there&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="1748.67" dur="8.09">there are many many more now it looks</text>
  <text start="1753.53" dur="6.03">like Kiev has paid their gas bill and</text>
  <text start="1756.76" dur="3.88">they&amp;#39;re good until March fifteenth and</text>
  <text start="1759.56" dur="3.81">again they going to have to make another</text>
  <text start="1760.64" dur="4.77">prepayment and they&amp;#39;re continually doing</text>
  <text start="1763.37" dur="4.17">this they&amp;#39;re not paying for long periods</text>
  <text start="1765.41" dur="5.97">of time they&amp;#39;re only giving a small</text>
  <text start="1767.54" dur="6.42">trunk that will last about five to ten</text>
  <text start="1771.38" dur="5.79">days because they&amp;#39;re trying to wean</text>
  <text start="1773.96" dur="5.82">themselves off of the gas from Russia</text>
  <text start="1777.17" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re trying to get the gas from the</text>
  <text start="1779.78" dur="5.34">European neighbours and it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="1782.45" dur="5.73">well at this point what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1785.12" dur="4.83">interesting when the Ukrainian armed</text>
  <text start="1788.18" dur="5.96">forces were fighting against the militia</text>
  <text start="1789.95" dur="7.35">the southeastern militias they had</text>

  <text start="1899.67" dur="5.79">bankers want all of this money is going</text>
  <text start="1903.12" dur="4.44">to help the war efforts none of it is</text>
  <text start="1905.46" dur="6.27">going to going to the people and the</text>
  <text start="1907.56" dur="6.33">people will just have to make two but</text>
  <text start="1911.73" dur="5.7">who will have to pay for all this it</text>
  <text start="1913.89" dur="6.21">goes right back to the people now the</text>
  <text start="1917.43" dur="5.52">Ukrainian forces continually say they</text>
  <text start="1920.1" dur="5.43">are removing their heavy weaponry from</text>
  <text start="1922.95" dur="6.3">the frontline and they&amp;#39;re saying almost</text>
  <text start="1925.53" dur="6.63">all of it has been fulfilled according</text>
  <text start="1929.25" dur="5.28">to the immense agreement but when we</text>
  <text start="1932.16" dur="6.45">look at exactly what they&amp;#39;ve done they</text>
  <text start="1934.53" dur="7.95">didn&amp;#39;t abide by the Minsk agreement what</text>
  <text start="1938.61" dur="7.17">they did was is they moved the military</text>
  <text start="1942.48" dur="6.96">equipment about 20 to 30 kilometers back</text>
  <text start="1945.78" dur="7.11">which is about 12 to 18 miles which then</text>
  <text start="1949.44" dur="6.06">can be returned right to the front lines</text>
  <text start="1952.89" dur="6.42">and when they say they removed their</text>
  <text start="1955.5" dur="5.73">heavy weapons they never give the exact</text>
  <text start="1959.31" dur="4.34">distance from the front line which is</text>
  <text start="1961.23" dur="4.5">required by the Minsk agreement and</text>
  <text start="1963.65" dur="4.18">again you can see they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="1965.73" dur="5.51">because they realize eventually they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1967.83" dur="6.54">going to mount a major major offensive</text>
  <text start="1971.24" dur="6.49">now it seems that the Ukraine military</text>
