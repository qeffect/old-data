  <text start="66.65" dur="5.73">suggests eurozone needs to be ready for</text>
  <text start="68.66" dur="5.91">a crisis let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="72.38" dur="4.26">collapse financial news now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="74.57" dur="4.62">following and tracking Venezuela and</text>
  <text start="76.64" dur="4.71">we&amp;#39;ve been reporting that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="79.19" dur="4.56">making their payments and we know that</text>
  <text start="81.35" dur="4.23">the EU with the u.s. they&amp;#39;re sanctioning</text>
  <text start="83.75" dur="3.24">Venezuela trying to put a lot of</text>
  <text start="85.58" dur="4.08">pressure on Venezuela and we know that</text>
  <text start="86.99" dur="6.18">Venezuela has turned to the yuyuan</text>
  <text start="89.66" dur="7.34">looking at the ruble dealing outside of</text>
  <text start="93.17" dur="7.8">the dollar and we see at this point that</text>
  <text start="97" dur="8.65">Venezuela they have not made their</text>
  <text start="100.97" dur="7.11">payment they need to make a 1.1 billion</text>
  <text start="105.65" dur="5.01">payment which was due last Friday and</text>
  <text start="108.08" dur="5.46">they didn&amp;#39;t do it and we might see</text>
  <text start="110.66" dur="5.34">Venezuela default within the next 24</text>
  <text start="113.54" dur="4.32">hours I mean we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see</text>
  <text start="116" dur="5.82">but we can see we&amp;#39;re headed in that</text>
  <text start="117.86" dur="6.42">direction and once again we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="121.82" dur="5.64">China might step in and bail them out</text>
  <text start="124.28" dur="5.24">Russia might step in bail them out and</text>
  <text start="127.46" dur="7.02">when I say this I mean loan them money</text>
  <text start="129.52" dur="7.12">to pay this debt off and at this point</text>
  <text start="134.48" dur="3.81">we know that the EU especially United</text>
  <text start="136.64" dur="3.27">States the Cabal they&amp;#39;re putting a lot</text>
  <text start="138.29" dur="5.07">of pressure on Venezuela because they</text>
  <text start="139.91" dur="5.73">want to go into this country steal their</text>
  <text start="143.36" dur="4.65">natural resources set up a private West</text>
  <text start="145.64" dur="5.13">a central bank control the entire system</text>
  <text start="148.01" dur="4.08">and place the dollar on their natural</text>
  <text start="150.77" dur="4.71">resources because this is what the</text>
  <text start="152.09" dur="6.69">central banks do and they use the armies</text>
  <text start="155.48" dur="5.4">of the country they are in to do this</text>
  <text start="158.78" dur="5.7">once they get the country as a reserve</text>
  <text start="160.88" dur="5.25">currency they push their agenda and we</text>
  <text start="164.48" dur="3.9">can see that they&amp;#39;ve been doing this for</text>
  <text start="166.13" dur="4.95">a very long time because they need to</text>
  <text start="168.38" dur="4.14">put every country into debt and they</text>
  <text start="171.08" dur="3.66">need to continually do this on a</text>
  <text start="172.52" dur="4.14">non-stop basis or their system</text>
  <text start="174.74" dur="5.28">completely falls apart and this is why</text>
  <text start="176.66" dur="5.46">the u.s. is continually invading having</text>
  <text start="180.02" dur="3.63">regime change setting up a private west</text>
  <text start="182.12" dur="3.509">central bank and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="183.65" dur="2.58">doing this we see that the precious</text>
  <text start="185.629" dur="3.961">metals mark</text>
  <text start="186.23" dur="6.45">well it looks like there were 10,000</text>
  <text start="189.59" dur="4.95">contracts 1.3 billion notional rush</text>
  <text start="192.68" dur="4.38">through and the two minutes before the</text>
  <text start="194.54" dur="5.55">US Open and it brought the precious</text>
  <text start="197.06" dur="4.8">metal prices down once again and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="200.09" dur="4.11">been seeing this quite a bit where</text>
  <text start="201.86" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re continually pushing the precious</text>
  <text start="204.2" dur="3.69">metal prices down and this is all</text>
  <text start="206.33" dur="4.409">manipulation we&amp;#39;ve been seeing it for a</text>
  <text start="207.89" dur="5.55">very long time one thing they can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="210.739" dur="4.5">is completely manipulate Bitcoin and</text>
  <text start="213.44" dur="3">other cryptocurrencies and this is why</text>
  <text start="215.239" dur="2.341">these other cryptocurrencies have been</text>
  <text start="216.44" dur="3.06">taking off because this is what a real</text>
  <text start="217.58" dur="5.01">free market looks like yes you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="219.5" dur="5.489">to see ups and downs and you know you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="222.59" dur="4.709">gonna see you know huge ups huge downs</text>
  <text start="224.989" dur="5.28">and this is what you see in a normal</text>
  <text start="227.299" dur="6.571">market in a manipulated market you</text>
  <text start="230.269" dur="5.701">continually see thousands or millions</text>
  <text start="233.87" dur="3.69">and millions of contracts thrown at the</text>
  <text start="235.97" dur="3.18">precious metal market the precious metal</text>
  <text start="237.56" dur="4.35">market never goes up it just goes down</text>
  <text start="239.15" dur="4.589">or stays steady the stock market which</text>
  <text start="241.91" dur="3.72">is the opposite where you can see it</text>
  <text start="243.739" dur="5.461">just continually moves up and up and up</text>
  <text start="245.63" dur="5.13">these are manipulated markets because in</text>
  <text start="249.2" dur="3.689">a real market people get nervous people</text>
  <text start="250.76" dur="4.5">get afraid they take their funds out</text>
  <text start="252.889" dur="3.69">they don&amp;#39;t have central banks creating</text>
  <text start="255.26" dur="3.27">currency out of thin air and just buying</text>
  <text start="256.579" dur="3.421">the stocks when people sell it saying oh</text>
  <text start="258.53" dur="3.81">no we&amp;#39;re not gonna let this mock this</text>
  <text start="260" dur="4.2">stock market go down and we see at this</text>
  <text start="262.34" dur="4.44">point this is why there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="264.2" dur="4.62">individuals now heading into the crypto</text>
  <text start="266.78" dur="3.449">market we see the real estate market</text>
  <text start="268.82" dur="4.4">well we&amp;#39;ve been talking about this for</text>
  <text start="270.229" dur="6.031">quite a while but we see out in New York</text>
  <text start="273.22" dur="6.34">the Koala a Lukas posh penthouse</text>
  <text start="276.26" dur="6.27">apartment in 157 one of Manhattan&amp;#39;s most</text>
  <text start="279.56" dur="5.55">expensive luxury towers has finally sold</text>
  <text start="282.53" dur="4.199">after months of delays in what New York</text>
  <text start="285.11" dur="3.84">Realtors agree is the most expensive</text>
  <text start="286.729" dur="5.071">residential foreclosure in the city</text>
  <text start="288.95" dur="7.2">history now the sale price is 36 million</text>
  <text start="291.8" dur="7.89">and what has happened here is that they</text>
  <text start="296.15" dur="5.69">had to reduce the price and it was on</text>
  <text start="299.69" dur="5.46">the market for a very long time actually</text>
  <text start="301.84" dur="5.259">the apartment went or the condo went on</text>
  <text start="305.15" dur="5.13">with the penthouse I should say he went</text>
  <text start="307.099" dur="6.151">on the market in 2011 and as of August</text>
  <text start="310.28" dur="4.74">there are still five units for sale and</text>
  <text start="313.25" dur="6.26">they&amp;#39;re continually reducing the price</text>
  <text start="315.02" dur="6.86">and they came down 22% below the asking</text>
  <text start="319.51" dur="4.59">yes it&amp;#39;s still in the millions but this</text>
  <text start="321.88" dur="4.05">gives you a snapshot in what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="324.1" dur="3.9">happening in the real in the real estate</text>

  <text start="331" dur="4.14">starts at the top it works its way down</text>
  <text start="332.98" dur="4.2">and we are definitely seeing this and</text>
  <text start="335.14" dur="3.66">we&amp;#39;re seeing this in many cities where</text>
  <text start="337.18" dur="3.87">there&amp;#39;s a lot of houses that are for</text>
  <text start="338.8" dur="4.35">sale and people have their houses on the</text>
  <text start="341.05" dur="3.51">market especially outside of those</text>
  <text start="343.15" dur="3.12">cities that they&amp;#39;re manipulating and</text>
  <text start="344.56" dur="2.79">people are scratching their head because</text>
  <text start="346.27" dur="2.79">they&amp;#39;re listening to the corporate media</text>
  <text start="347.35" dur="3.45">listen to the government listening to</text>

  <text start="506.47" dur="4.23">economic crisis even though everything</text>
  <text start="508.57" dur="3.779">is fine right now we should have</text>
  <text start="510.7" dur="5.219">something in place just in case</text>
  <text start="512.349" dur="5.221">something happens like in 2008 now the</text>
  <text start="515.919" dur="3.99">proposal comes as the European</text>

  <text start="546.73" dur="4.59">something just like the Fed is preparing</text>
  <text start="549.31" dur="3.96">for something just like the rest of the</text>
  <text start="551.32" dur="4.47">central banks are preparing for</text>
  <text start="553.27" dur="5.22">something and we can see right now they</text>
  <text start="555.79" dur="5.34">want all these countries on board where</text>
  <text start="558.49" dur="6.24">they need to listen to the central banks</text>
  <text start="561.13" dur="6.81">and they need to do whatever they say if</text>
  <text start="564.73" dur="7.229">we ask for austerity you must do</text>
  <text start="567.94" dur="6.33">austerity to get the money which they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="571.959" dur="4.741">gonna create out of thin air so we can</text>
  <text start="574.27" dur="5.009">see already that they are very nervous</text>
  <text start="576.7" dur="4.44">and they&amp;#39;re worried about another</text>
  <text start="579.279" dur="4.771">economic shock actually Janet Yellen</text>
  <text start="581.14" dur="5.43">came out and this was a couple of months</text>
  <text start="584.05" dur="5.25">ago where she&amp;#39;s saying that you know she</text>
  <text start="586.57" dur="4.65">worried about another economic crisis</text>
  <text start="589.3" dur="3.69">even though she said we&amp;#39;re not gonna see</text>
  <text start="591.22" dur="4.32">one in our lifetime they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="592.99" dur="6.06">preparing for another economic crisis</text>
  <text start="595.54" dur="5.49">the IMF buried in their paper is saying</text>
  <text start="599.05" dur="4.5">that yes there is a collapse of the</text>
  <text start="601.03" dur="5.49">system coming the biz is saying that</text>
  <text start="603.55" dur="4.68">this debt worldwide is unsustainable and</text>
  <text start="606.52" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re just covering themselves because</text>
  <text start="608.23" dur="4.11">they know if they can&amp;#39;t get an event</text>
  <text start="609.94" dur="3.51">started they&amp;#39;re gonna be blamed so they</text>
  <text start="612.34" dur="2.88">might as well come out now and say</text>
  <text start="613.45" dur="2.34">listen we told you we told you this was</text>
  <text start="615.22" dur="2.25">gonna happen</text>
  <text start="615.79" dur="4.65">and we could see this is exactly what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="617.47" dur="5.28">going on now we must understand that the</text>
  <text start="620.44" dur="3.69">Fed when they talk about inflation and</text>
  <text start="622.75" dur="4.68">talking about two different types of</text>
  <text start="624.13" dur="6.27">inflation in their minds there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="627.43" dur="5.52">different types in around the world one</text>
  <text start="630.4" dur="5.16">where the people feel the inflation</text>
  <text start="632.95" dur="4.23">where you go to the store you feel yeah</text>
  <text start="635.56" dur="3.09">like food is more exposure you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="637.18" dur="3.71">feel it you see that food is more</text>
  <text start="638.65" dur="4.95">expensive when you go buy an automobile</text>
  <text start="640.89" dur="4.24">it&amp;#39;s more expensive when you purchase a</text>
  <text start="643.6" dur="4.02">home it&amp;#39;s more expensive when you go to</text>
  <text start="645.13" dur="4.2">college is more expensive when you go</text>
  <text start="647.62" dur="4.68">purchase anything it&amp;#39;s more expensive</text>
  <text start="649.33" dur="5.46">and this is the inflation that people</text>
  <text start="652.3" dur="4.76">feel and this is because the purchasing</text>
  <text start="654.79" dur="5.16">power of the US dollar has declined</text>
  <text start="657.06" dur="5.47">since the inception of the dollar back</text>
  <text start="659.95" dur="5.7">in 1913 when the Federal Reserve was</text>
  <text start="662.53" dur="5.79">created and ever since then it has lost</text>
  <text start="665.65" dur="6.81">value where it&amp;#39;s hovering just above</text>
  <text start="668.32" dur="8.13">zero right now the other inflation is</text>
  <text start="672.46" dur="6.21">what central bankers talked about I mean</text>
