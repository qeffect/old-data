  <text start="108.78" dur="2.94">starting to see that the market well</text>
  <text start="110.28" dur="4.229">it&amp;#39;s starting to come down but once</text>
  <text start="111.72" dur="6.929">again the market really doesn&amp;#39;t give you</text>
  <text start="114.509" dur="7.441">the gauge of how the economy is really</text>

  <text start="121.95" dur="4.23">it really comes down and declines and</text>
  <text start="123.78" dur="4.589">loads people say hey what just happened</text>
  <text start="126.18" dur="5.1">here is there a problem with the economy</text>
  <text start="128.369" dur="5.641">the economy behind the scenes behind all</text>
  <text start="131.28" dur="5.01">of this well it&amp;#39;s been deteriorating for</text>
  <text start="134.01" dur="4.819">quite a while and there are countries</text>
  <text start="136.29" dur="5.28">all around the world that are doing</text>
  <text start="138.829" dur="5.44">terribly I mean the countries in Europe</text>
  <text start="141.57" dur="5.22">well their unemployment rate is between</text>
  <text start="144.269" dur="5.401">nine point five percent and ten point</text>
  <text start="146.79" dur="4.65">five percent since 2008 now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="149.67" dur="3.93">telling us that it&amp;#39;s come down a little</text>
  <text start="151.44" dur="4.829">bit and things are improving but we have</text>
  <text start="153.6" dur="5.04">to remember the central bank in Europe</text>
  <text start="156.269" dur="5.161">well they&amp;#39;re monetizing they&amp;#39;re buying</text>
  <text start="158.64" dur="7.26">up corporate debt they&amp;#39;re buying bonds</text>
  <text start="161.43" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re creating currency and we see</text>
  <text start="165.9" dur="3.48">right now this is what all the central</text>
  <text start="167.34" dur="5.97">banks are doing because in the end</text>
  <text start="169.38" dur="8.039">stages this is all they can do now in</text>
  <text start="173.31" dur="6.46">Greece they are continually getting loan</text>
  <text start="177.419" dur="4.181">after loan after loan</text>
  <text start="179.77" dur="5.91">and they&amp;#39;re going further and further</text>
  <text start="181.6" dur="5.46">into debt and in the next few weeks well</text>
  <text start="185.68" dur="3.33">this is going to be very interesting to</text>
  <text start="187.06" dur="3.96">see whether or not the European Union</text>
  <text start="189.01" dur="3.96">and the European Central Bank really</text>
  <text start="191.02" dur="4.86">care about the well-being of Greece and</text>
  <text start="192.97" dur="6.45">the Greek economy and we know that the</text>
  <text start="195.88" dur="7.26">IMF well they didn&amp;#39;t want to give a</text>
  <text start="199.42" dur="6.87">bailout in 2015 because they wanted some</text>
  <text start="203.14" dur="4.5">of the debt written off and are they</text>
  <text start="206.29" dur="4.83">going to go for the third bailout</text>
  <text start="207.64" dur="4.89">package with the ECB what will have to</text>
  <text start="211.12" dur="5.48">wait and see but we do understand</text>
  <text start="212.53" dur="8.52">they&amp;#39;re calling for more austerity in</text>
  <text start="216.6" dur="6.61">Greece and the IMF is saying they doubt</text>
  <text start="221.05" dur="5.7">the possibility that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="223.21" dur="5.1">reach 3.5% without additional austerity</text>
  <text start="226.75" dur="5.21">because remember today we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="228.31" dur="7.5">reach 3.5% GDP which seems a little</text>
  <text start="231.96" dur="8.14">impossible at this time but we know for</text>
  <text start="235.81" dur="7.74">a fact more debt is not going to help</text>
  <text start="240.1" dur="6.359">more austerity is not going to help and</text>
  <text start="243.55" dur="6.15">remember the central banks they prey</text>
  <text start="246.459" dur="6.091">upon the countries they like to keep</text>
  <text start="249.7" dur="6.45">them barely afloat so they can</text>
  <text start="252.55" dur="6.689">continually rob them of their assets if</text>
  <text start="256.15" dur="5.67">they have these countries go bankrupt it</text>
  <text start="259.239" dur="5.881">shows that their system doesn&amp;#39;t work if</text>
  <text start="261.82" dur="5.57">they keep them afloat continually taking</text>
  <text start="265.12" dur="5.19">on more and more debt having them cut</text>
  <text start="267.39" dur="5.68">you know jobs with austerity cut</text>
  <text start="270.31" dur="5.1">programs with austerity it allows them</text>
  <text start="273.07" dur="4.53">to go into the country because then the</text>
  <text start="275.41" dur="5.16">country has to sell their assets to get</text>
  <text start="277.6" dur="4.85">all those hard assets for the paper and</text>
  <text start="280.57" dur="5.31">ink and this is what they like to do</text>
  <text start="282.45" dur="5.89">this is why they keep countries in this</text>
  <text start="285.88" dur="5.4">limbo state they don&amp;#39;t want to bankrupt</text>
  <text start="288.34" dur="5.52">them because that looks bad we see out</text>
  <text start="291.28" dur="4.65">in the UK the British retail industry</text>
  <text start="293.86" dur="5.16">well they could lose a 1 million jobs if</text>
  <text start="295.93" dur="6">the government fails to act and this is</text>
  <text start="299.02" dur="5.04">coming from a new report a task force of</text>
  <text start="301.93" dur="3.989">retailers and unions found that some</text>
  <text start="304.06" dur="4.91">firms were squeezing costs by paying</text>
  <text start="305.919" dur="5.791">staff as little as legally possible and</text>
  <text start="308.97" dur="3.8">outsourcing entire areas of their</text>
  <text start="311.71" dur="3.04">business</text>
  <text start="312.77" dur="4.56">and of course they&amp;#39;re saying that online</text>
  <text start="314.75" dur="5.46">business is really hurting their sales</text>
  <text start="317.33" dur="3.66">not the economy not that people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="320.21" dur="2.22">have jobs</text>
  <text start="320.99" dur="3.709">nothing like that even in Germany</text>
  <text start="322.43" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re saying that retails dropped</text>
  <text start="324.699" dur="4.541">unexpectedly in December now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="326.75" dur="5.009">blaming that on the deadly terror attack</text>
  <text start="329.24" dur="6.359">in the marketplace retail sales dropped</text>
  <text start="331.759" dur="7.47">by 0.9 percent from November economics</text>
  <text start="335.599" dur="5.371">they expected at 0.5% gain and what</text>
  <text start="339.229" dur="2.66">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now since December of</text>
  <text start="340.97" dur="4.52">2015</text>
  <text start="341.889" dur="7.421">well sales are way down on a</text>
  <text start="345.49" dur="6.78">year-to-year basis and it just didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="349.31" dur="5.16">have to do with the market terror attack</text>
  <text start="352.27" dur="5.709">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do right now is</text>
  <text start="354.47" dur="5.91">explain away why retail sales are</text>
  <text start="357.979" dur="4.68">dropping in all of these countries why</text>
  <text start="360.38" dur="5.43">these countries aren&amp;#39;t doing as well as</text>
  <text start="362.659" dur="5.701">they&amp;#39;re supposed to be doing and we can</text>
  <text start="365.81" dur="4.02">see that this is spreading across the</text>
  <text start="368.36" dur="3.51">globe anyway there is that private</text>
  <text start="369.83" dur="4.86">western central bank we see retail</text>
  <text start="371.87" dur="5.13">declining and it&amp;#39;s not because everyone</text>
  <text start="374.69" dur="5.13">going to online most of these companies</text>
  <text start="377" dur="7.32">have an online presence but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="379.82" dur="6.719">going completely bankrupt now here in</text>
  <text start="384.32" dur="4.71">the United States we see the conference</text>
  <text start="386.539" dur="4.651">board which is funded by the government</text>
  <text start="389.03" dur="5.37">all of a sudden they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="391.19" dur="5.67">consumer confidence well it is starting</text>
  <text start="394.4" dur="6.29">to dip now since the first time since</text>
  <text start="396.86" dur="7.17">October right before the elections and</text>
  <text start="400.69" dur="4.539">the people are saying that well it</text>
  <text start="404.03" dur="3.87">doesn&amp;#39;t look like it&amp;#39;s a good time to</text>
  <text start="405.229" dur="4.381">buy a home or a car or major appliance</text>
  <text start="407.9" dur="5.519">this is how it&amp;#39;s always been</text>
  <text start="409.61" dur="6.029">and what they did was they pushed the</text>
  <text start="413.419" dur="4.291">surveys up to make it look really good</text>
  <text start="415.639" dur="3.9">for the election and now everything is</text>
  <text start="417.71" dur="4.41">starting to slide but nothing&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="419.539" dur="4.791">changed things are absolutely awful I</text>
  <text start="422.12" dur="5.609">mean here we have the stock market at</text>
  <text start="424.33" dur="6.369">20,000 points and everyone&amp;#39;s out there</text>
  <text start="427.729" dur="4.37">saying Oh Trump euphoria the companies</text>
  <text start="430.699" dur="4.231">are doing well now everything looks</text>
  <text start="432.099" dur="4.981">fantastic everything&amp;#39;s great and the</text>
  <text start="434.93" dur="4.859">question is why is the stock market at</text>
  <text start="437.08" dur="5.259">20,000 points at all why is it this high</text>
  <text start="439.789" dur="5.66">at all in the first place because when</text>
  <text start="442.339" dur="4.201">you really look you see revenues in 2016</text>
  <text start="445.449" dur="4.751">there</text>
  <text start="446.54" dur="7.8">lower than they had been in 2008 only</text>
  <text start="450.2" dur="8.13">2009 and 2010 were lower so in terms of</text>
  <text start="454.34" dur="7.29">revenues 2016 was for the dow components</text>
  <text start="458.33" dur="6.56">X Apple the worst year since 2010 and</text>
  <text start="461.63" dur="8.43">this despite the five year binge in</text>
  <text start="464.89" dur="8.29">acquisitions so how have the last two</text>
  <text start="470.06" dur="6.66">years been well of the 30 companies in</text>
  <text start="473.18" dur="7.26">the Dow 16 sported declining revenues in</text>
  <text start="476.72" dur="7.05">2016 and 17 sported declining revenues</text>
  <text start="480.44" dur="7.08">over the two-year span since 2014 only</text>
  <text start="483.77" dur="7.8">two of them are oil companies so why is</text>
  <text start="487.52" dur="8.13">the Dow so high called manipulation it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="491.57" dur="6.81">called this is another bubble and the</text>
  <text start="495.65" dur="5.58">insiders are getting out of the market</text>
  <text start="498.38" dur="6.24">now they&amp;#39;re selling off to retailers we</text>
  <text start="501.23" dur="6.84">see Under Armour well their revenue it</text>
  <text start="504.62" dur="6.39">completely missed we see ups fourth</text>
  <text start="508.07" dur="4.83">quarter results well they didn&amp;#39;t do what</text>
  <text start="511.01" dur="4.29">they were supposed to do I guess</text>
  <text start="512.9" dur="5.97">everyone&amp;#39;s not buying as much online as</text>
  <text start="515.3" dur="7.23">we thought because if it this was true</text>
  <text start="518.87" dur="6.54">and gas prices are very low they&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="522.53" dur="6.21">making a huge huge profit but they</text>
  <text start="525.41" dur="6.3">weren&amp;#39;t and they didn&amp;#39;t now Case Shiller</text>
  <text start="528.74" dur="5.88">is out there and they are reporting on</text>
  <text start="531.71" dur="4.98">the 20-city saying that well home prices</text>
  <text start="534.62" dur="5.37">have reached record highs in November</text>
  <text start="536.69" dur="6.32">and they&amp;#39;re saying this is incredible</text>
  <text start="539.99" dur="8.34">we&amp;#39;re at the height of where we were</text>
  <text start="543.01" dur="7.09">prior to the Great Recession in 2008 now</text>
  <text start="548.33" dur="4.13">remember they&amp;#39;re looking at 20 cities</text>
  <text start="550.1" dur="6.03">Plus this data is from November and</text>
  <text start="552.46" dur="4.93">since that time things have changed but</text>
  <text start="556.13" dur="3.3">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all this</text>
  <text start="557.39" dur="4.35">is that prices are continually moving up</text>
  <text start="559.43" dur="6.54">up up up up and mortgage applications</text>
  <text start="561.74" dur="7.22">they have imploded so this is quite odd</text>
  <text start="565.97" dur="5.97">and like we reported a couple days ago</text>
  <text start="568.96" dur="5.98">we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot less investment</text>
  <text start="571.94" dur="6.59">from China they&amp;#39;re keeping their cash</text>
  <text start="574.94" dur="5.399">within their country we see out in Miami</text>
  <text start="578.53" dur="5.859">well it looks like</text>
  <text start="580.339" dur="7.131">the condo flipping fun is completely</text>
  <text start="584.389" dur="7.2">over what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now are</text>
  <text start="587.47" dur="8.14">sagging sales understated inventories</text>
  <text start="591.589" dur="8.131">and things are not going well whatsoever</text>
  <text start="595.61" dur="6.63">it looks like it&amp;#39;s a bloodbath and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="599.72" dur="5.029">already starting to begin we saw this</text>
  <text start="602.24" dur="5.88">before prior to 2008</text>
  <text start="604.749" dur="5.981">now the Dallas Fed they&amp;#39;ve given their</text>
  <text start="608.12" dur="4.709">forecast of what the Trump accom economy</text>
  <text start="610.73" dur="3.899">will look like and they said President</text>
  <text start="612.829" dur="3.841">Trump looks to do things that will be</text>
  <text start="614.629" dur="3.51">favorable for business which would</text>
  <text start="616.67" dur="5.339">improve employment and growth if</text>
  <text start="618.139" dur="6.151">successful however protestors are all</text>
  <text start="622.009" dur="4.44">over the place so tend to think that</text>
  <text start="624.29" dur="5.63">will cause trouble for the country and</text>
  <text start="626.449" dur="6.57">for the business well that is true</text>
  <text start="629.92" dur="5.74">Chicago business barometer was revised</text>
  <text start="633.019" dur="6.661">lower in December and then crashed lower</text>
  <text start="635.66" dur="7.71">in January to 50.3 new orders employment</text>
  <text start="639.68" dur="5.639">inventories well they all fell the last</text>
  <text start="643.37" dur="5.85">time it was lower was in February of</text>
  <text start="645.319" dur="9.57">2016 and we are approaching the</text>
  <text start="649.22" dur="7.919">recession area once again so it shot up</text>
  <text start="654.889" dur="5.101">right before the elections and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="657.139" dur="6.961">back to where we were prior to the</text>
  <text start="659.99" dur="6.599">elections amazing now Obama is out there</text>
  <text start="664.1" dur="5.13">and he is proclaiming that he saved the</text>
  <text start="666.589" dur="5.25">US economy and we really need to think</text>
  <text start="669.23" dur="5.669">about this because he&amp;#39;s out there</text>
  <text start="671.839" dur="5.43">telling us that you know he was the</text>
  <text start="674.899" dur="4.92">grand master of saving the economy and</text>
  <text start="677.269" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;re supposed to believe that the</text>
  <text start="679.819" dur="4.56">community organizer with zero business</text>
  <text start="681.679" dur="5.7">experience never ran a company nothing</text>
  <text start="684.379" dur="6">let us let us out of a recession and</text>
  <text start="687.379" dur="9.81">kept us from the Great Depression with</text>
  <text start="690.379" dur="9.481">his financial savvy now we know this is</text>
  <text start="697.189" dur="5.161">not what happened what he did was he</text>
  <text start="699.86" dur="6.18">manipulated unemployment he manipulated</text>
  <text start="702.35" dur="6.81">GDP the central banks created a lot of</text>
  <text start="706.04" dur="4.799">currency gave it to the banks the banks</text>
  <text start="709.16" dur="3.119">took that currency they weren&amp;#39;t allowed</text>
  <text start="710.839" dur="2.831">to loan it out they had a prop up the</text>
