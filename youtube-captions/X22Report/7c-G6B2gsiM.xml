  <text start="77.4" dur="4.95">economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="80.159" dur="4.71">when we talk about the economy about</text>
  <text start="82.35" dur="5.309">draining the swamp we need to remember</text>
  <text start="84.869" dur="5.221">that this is not just a short little</text>
  <text start="87.659" dur="4.35">stint where we say okay let&amp;#39;s arrest a</text>
  <text start="90.09" dur="4.01">couple of people let&amp;#39;s you know what</text>
  <text start="92.009" dur="5.07">let&amp;#39;s put some gold bugs on the Fed and</text>
  <text start="94.1" dur="6.79">hopefully everything just works out this</text>
  <text start="97.079" dur="6.981">is much much more than this because to</text>
  <text start="100.89" dur="6.359">be economically free or free altogether</text>
  <text start="104.06" dur="5.68">we need to do many different things and</text>
  <text start="107.249" dur="7.381">I&amp;#39;m talking about We the People Trump</text>
  <text start="109.74" dur="6.809">the Patriots we just can&amp;#39;t say okay you</text>
  <text start="114.63" dur="4.86">know what we placed a couple of people</text>
  <text start="116.549" dur="5.161">in the Fed everything&amp;#39;s okay let the</text>
  <text start="119.49" dur="4.559">central bank go ahead and do what they</text>
  <text start="121.71" dur="4.049">normally do let all the central banks</text>
  <text start="124.049" dur="4.38">around the world do what they normally</text>
  <text start="125.759" dur="7.201">do because this would not benefit the</text>
  <text start="128.429" dur="6.78">people actually nothing would change the</text>
  <text start="132.96" dur="5.97">only way to be economically free and</text>
  <text start="135.209" dur="8.491">free of all of this is that we need to</text>
  <text start="138.93" dur="8.25">get rid of the central bank the private</text>
  <text start="143.7" dur="6.78">western central bank needs to be removed</text>
  <text start="147.18" dur="5.46">it needs to be dismantled and explain</text>
  <text start="150.48" dur="4.53">why a little bit later in this report</text>
  <text start="152.64" dur="5.46">but I wanted to head out to the UK first</text>
  <text start="155.01" dur="6.059">because yesterday we mentioned Boros</text>
  <text start="158.1" dur="5.309">jump Boris Johnson he has the deal</text>
  <text start="161.069" dur="3.871">coming up October 31st and prior to</text>
  <text start="163.409" dur="5.341">October 31st we know</text>
  <text start="164.94" dur="5.34">that Parliament is not in session and we</text>
  <text start="168.75" dur="4.65">said this would be a perfect time for</text>
  <text start="170.28" dur="5.73">Boris Johnson to move forward now</text>
  <text start="173.4" dur="5.1">remember he promised to do this or he</text>
  <text start="176.01" dur="4.56">has to resign now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="178.5" dur="5.64">interesting we know that the EU and</text>
  <text start="180.57" dur="5.25">those within government they are going</text>
  <text start="184.14" dur="3.27">to try to stop this any way they</text>
  <text start="185.82" dur="4.29">possibly can look what they did with May</text>
  <text start="187.41" dur="6.6">with the deal there it was not what the</text>
  <text start="190.11" dur="6.48">people wanted so what did they do well</text>
  <text start="194.01" dur="5.46">they knew that Parliament wasn&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="196.59" dur="7.65">to be in session prior to the October</text>
  <text start="199.47" dur="7.35">31st date so Parliament and I believe</text>
  <text start="204.24" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re not alone in doing this there</text>
  <text start="206.82" dur="6.42">were certain influential individuals</text>
  <text start="210" dur="6.12">probably from the EU that said listen we</text>
  <text start="213.24" dur="6.33">need some type of an amendment to</text>
  <text start="216.12" dur="5.99">suspend anything that happens during</text>
  <text start="219.57" dur="6.03">this period of time and that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="222.11" dur="5.59">what happened MPs in the House of</text>
  <text start="225.6" dur="6.3">Commons backed an amendment by a</text>
  <text start="227.7" dur="6.539">majority of 41 315 to 274 which blocks</text>
  <text start="231.9" dur="5.55">the suspension of Parliament between</text>
  <text start="234.239" dur="6.691">October 9th and December 18th unless a</text>
  <text start="237.45" dur="6.63">Northern Ireland Executive is formed the</text>
  <text start="240.93" dur="5.07">vote is a blow for Johnson and we know</text>
  <text start="244.08" dur="4.17">that he&amp;#39;s not the prime minister yet but</text>
  <text start="246" dur="5.07">he&amp;#39;s the frontrunner to become the prime</text>
  <text start="248.25" dur="7.11">minister and what they did was they</text>
  <text start="251.07" dur="7.05">suspended all of this so Parliament will</text>
  <text start="255.36" dur="5.52">be there and what are they going to do</text>
  <text start="258.12" dur="3.899">they&amp;#39;re going to try to block the</text>
  <text start="260.88" dur="6.99">October 31st</text>
  <text start="262.019" dur="8.481">No Deal exit remember the EU and many</text>
  <text start="267.87" dur="5.58">individuals that side with the EU</text>
  <text start="270.5" dur="5.95">they&amp;#39;re not going to let this happen</text>
  <text start="273.45" dur="5.46">very easily as you can see this is why</text>
  <text start="276.45" dur="4.5">May tried to push the deal how many</text>
  <text start="278.91" dur="3.63">times four or five six times and it</text>
  <text start="280.95" dur="4.59">failed every single time because it</text>
  <text start="282.54" dur="5.82">wasn&amp;#39;t a people&amp;#39;s deal Boris Johnson</text>
  <text start="285.54" dur="6.36">he&amp;#39;s gonna go up against the same exact</text>
  <text start="288.36" dur="5.4">thing he&amp;#39;s going to push and the EU and</text>
  <text start="291.9" dur="6.57">certain individuals are going to push</text>
  <text start="293.76" dur="7.14">back remember the central bank the EU</text>
  <text start="298.47" dur="5.16">they don&amp;#39;t want the UK to leave if the</text>
  <text start="300.9" dur="4.77">UK leaves other countries are going to</text>
  <text start="303.63" dur="6.32">see this other countries are going to</text>
  <text start="305.67" dur="6.81">see how well the UK does and when the UK</text>
  <text start="309.95" dur="4.21">prospers and does very well it makes</text>
  <text start="312.48" dur="4.17">trade agreements with the United States</text>
  <text start="314.16" dur="5.16">and other countries other countries like</text>
  <text start="316.65" dur="5.13">Italy hungry and the rest are gonna say</text>
  <text start="319.32" dur="4.68">hey wait a minute here why don&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="321.78" dur="4.62">follow in their footsteps and guess what</text>
  <text start="324" dur="5.58">happens to the EU at this point it</text>
  <text start="326.4" dur="5.34">starts to fall apart so the central</text>
  <text start="329.58" dur="5.79">bankers they don&amp;#39;t give up that easily</text>
  <text start="331.74" dur="6.21">and we know this but again this is what</text>
  <text start="335.37" dur="6.96">this is all about it&amp;#39;s the fight until</text>
  <text start="337.95" dur="6.87">the very end and we can never give just</text>
  <text start="342.33" dur="3.93">like the central bank can give Trump is</text>
  <text start="344.82" dur="6.48">out there the Patriots are out there</text>
  <text start="346.26" dur="9.75">fighting every single day to bring the</text>
  <text start="351.3" dur="5.94">people back in power now here in the</text>
  <text start="356.01" dur="4.17">United States we know that the real</text>
  <text start="357.24" dur="5.4">estate market is imploding on itself and</text>
  <text start="360.18" dur="4.47">this is very big because a lot of people</text>
  <text start="362.64" dur="5.279">look at the real estate market and this</text>
  <text start="364.65" dur="6.24">is a lot of the everyday person&amp;#39;s wealth</text>
  <text start="367.919" dur="5.281">because houses appreciate they say wow</text>
  <text start="370.89" dur="3.75">this is pretty good I bought it at a</text>
  <text start="373.2" dur="2.73">hundred thousand now it&amp;#39;s worth a</text>
  <text start="374.64" dur="3.68">hundred and fifty I&amp;#39;ve just made fifty</text>
  <text start="375.93" dur="5.16">thousand dollars I&amp;#39;m feeling good and</text>
  <text start="378.32" dur="5.32">hopefully by the time I retire the house</text>
  <text start="381.09" dur="5.04">is worth a lot more I paid off a lot of</text>
  <text start="383.64" dur="6">my mortgage and I have a light nice</text>
  <text start="386.13" dur="5.97">little nest egg and what is happening</text>
  <text start="389.64" dur="4.58">here is that with this illusion with</text>
  <text start="392.1" dur="4.53">this economic Central Bank illusion</text>
  <text start="394.22" dur="4.93">everything is falling apart right now</text>
  <text start="396.63" dur="4.71">and this is why Trump is calling for a</text>
  <text start="399.15" dur="3.269">rate cut this is why he wants stimulus</text>
  <text start="401.34" dur="3.45">it looks like the central bank is</text>
  <text start="402.419" dur="4.711">following through which they probably</text>
  <text start="404.79" dur="5.81">most likely will in the cut in the next</text>
  <text start="407.13" dur="6.27">couple of weeks and once this happens</text>
  <text start="410.6" dur="5.5">Trump the Patriots they&amp;#39;re hoping to</text>
  <text start="413.4" dur="5.28">keep everything stable it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="416.1" dur="4.379">fix the housing market but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="418.68" dur="4.799">interesting about the housing market is</text>
  <text start="420.479" dur="5.25">that there were a lot of foreign</text>
  <text start="423.479" dur="3.571">investors invested in the market</text>
  <text start="425.729" dur="4.951">remember what the central banks have</text>
  <text start="427.05" dur="4.6">done once the real estate market came</text>
  <text start="430.68" dur="3.79">down</text>
  <text start="431.65" dur="6.359">they pumped it back up and all these</text>
  <text start="434.47" dur="5.91">foreign investors hedge funds investment</text>
  <text start="438.009" dur="4.921">companies they all came into the market</text>
  <text start="440.38" dur="5.67">and bought these homes on pennies on the</text>
  <text start="442.93" dur="6.269">dollar and then we had appreciation</text>
  <text start="446.05" dur="4.589">these are the bubbles keep houses off</text>
  <text start="449.199" dur="3.72">the market buy as many as you possibly</text>
  <text start="450.639" dur="4.891">can don&amp;#39;t rent them just keep them off</text>
  <text start="452.919" dur="5.34">the market and when you keep houses off</text>
  <text start="455.53" dur="4.47">the market it looks like everyone is</text>
  <text start="458.259" dur="4.981">selling and there&amp;#39;s not that much</text>
  <text start="460" dur="6.24">inventory and people want it and prices</text>
  <text start="463.24" dur="4.649">go up and foreign investors came in and</text>
  <text start="466.24" dur="5.1">they said hey this is a good way of</text>
  <text start="467.889" dur="3.991">making a lot of money off of homes what</text>
  <text start="471.34" dur="4.02">do they do</text>
  <text start="471.88" dur="5.55">when the market hits the top they sell</text>
  <text start="475.36" dur="4.559">they don&amp;#39;t want to hold on to this they</text>
  <text start="477.43" dur="3.18">know what is happening just like the</text>
  <text start="479.919" dur="3.301">stock market</text>
  <text start="480.61" dur="5.1">those inside investors what do they do</text>
  <text start="483.22" dur="5.79">when the market hits the top they sell</text>
  <text start="485.71" dur="5.94">now art can you gauge the absolute top</text>
  <text start="489.01" dur="5.67">no but when everything rises they take</text>
  <text start="491.65" dur="5.88">their profits well it&amp;#39;s happening in</text>
  <text start="494.68" dur="6.59">real estate right now purchases by</text>
  <text start="497.53" dur="6.139">resident foreigners plunged by 43%</text>
  <text start="501.27" dur="7.679">purchases by non-resident foreigners</text>
  <text start="503.669" dur="8.981">collapsed by 56% in total that&amp;#39;s around</text>
  <text start="508.949" dur="5.741">77 billion dollars and purchases by all</text>
  <text start="512.65" dur="5.759">foreign buyers in the period between</text>
  <text start="514.69" dur="6.899">April 2018 and March 2019 that plunged</text>
  <text start="518.409" dur="5.971">by 36 percent from the same period a</text>
  <text start="521.589" dur="6.481">year ago and 49 percent from the period</text>
  <text start="524.38" dur="7.32">two years ago they&amp;#39;re understanding that</text>
  <text start="528.07" dur="6.81">the market is coming down now rate cuts</text>
  <text start="531.7" dur="5.67">stimulus that might pump it up a little</text>
  <text start="534.88" dur="5.55">bit but that&amp;#39;s not the purpose the</text>
  <text start="537.37" dur="7.409">purpose is to make sure that the system</text>
  <text start="540.43" dur="7.83">does not collapse before the 2020</text>
  <text start="544.779" dur="4.771">elections this is why Trump is pushing</text>
  <text start="548.26" dur="4.17">this remember</text>
  <text start="549.55" dur="7.44">we were talking about how the Fed was</text>
  <text start="552.43" dur="6.81">raising rates in 2017-2018 and they were</text>
  <text start="556.99" dur="3.96">supposed to raise rates in 2019 because</text>
  <text start="559.24" dur="4.14">they were going to have the economy come</text>
  <text start="560.95" dur="4.8">down right before the election cue the</text>
  <text start="563.38" dur="6.03">Patriots they reverse this they took</text>
  <text start="565.75" dur="6.54">control now everything has been reversed</text>
  <text start="569.41" dur="6.6">and the plan is to stabilize everything</text>
  <text start="572.29" dur="7.02">long enough for Trump to win the</text>
  <text start="576.01" dur="5.88">election to say we have made the economy</text>
  <text start="579.31" dur="4.32">great look at the stock market look at</text>
  <text start="581.89" dur="3.93">the unemployment numbers look at the GDP</text>
  <text start="583.63" dur="4.41">numbers and these are the same exact</text>
  <text start="585.82" dur="4.29">numbers that the deep State the central</text>
  <text start="588.04" dur="3.78">bank&amp;#39;s have been using for a very long</text>
  <text start="590.11" dur="5.19">time to convince the American people and</text>
  <text start="591.82" dur="6.93">the world that the economy is absolutely</text>
  <text start="595.3" dur="5.34">fantastic and in the meantime what are</text>
  <text start="598.75" dur="6.54">the Patriots doing they&amp;#39;re creating a</text>
  <text start="600.64" dur="8.45">shadow economy to replace the central</text>
  <text start="605.29" dur="6.99">bank economy now minuchin and Pelosi</text>
  <text start="609.09" dur="7">they supposedly have made some type of</text>
  <text start="612.28" dur="6.33">deal on a top-line budget and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="616.09" dur="4.89">saying that they have a budget for year</text>
  <text start="618.61" dur="4.71">one and year two we&amp;#39;ll have to see how</text>
  <text start="620.98" dur="4.11">this plays out and actually if there is</text>
  <text start="623.32" dur="3.06">a budget tell you the truth at this</text>
  <text start="625.09" dur="4.2">point it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="626.38" dur="6.78">budget or no budget the entire system</text>
  <text start="629.29" dur="6.21">needs to be reset and everything needs</text>
  <text start="633.16" dur="5.13">to be wiped out and a new economy has to</text>
  <text start="635.5" dur="5.91">be brought in now remember this is not</text>
  <text start="638.29" dur="5.01">about another four-year election it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="641.41" dur="5.67">just not about arresting some</text>
  <text start="643.3" dur="6.12">individuals it&amp;#39;s about changing what the</text>
  <text start="647.08" dur="4.65">central bank what the deep state the</text>
  <text start="649.42" dur="6.99">mainstream media has done over the many</text>
  <text start="651.73" dur="8.04">many years to the United States and the</text>
  <text start="656.41" dur="7.44">only way to do this is to stop the</text>
  <text start="659.77" dur="6.5">central bank system how does the deep</text>
  <text start="663.85" dur="5.27">state the central bank</text>
  <text start="666.27" dur="6.46">keep control of everything</text>
  <text start="669.12" dur="7.24">it&amp;#39;s the reserve currency the reserve</text>
  <text start="672.73" dur="5.4">currency allows the deep state to</text>
  <text start="676.36" dur="4.23">control the rest of the world via</text>
  <text start="678.13" dur="4.26">sanctions Trump is using sanctions right</text>
  <text start="680.59" dur="6.27">now to his advantage</text>
  <text start="682.39" dur="7.17">and they&amp;#39;re able to manipulate certain</text>
  <text start="686.86" dur="5.79">economies the central bank has the</text>
