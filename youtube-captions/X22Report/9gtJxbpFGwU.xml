  <text start="107.46" dur="6.36">continually getting worse as toes on and</text>
  <text start="110.64" dur="6.269">what we&amp;#39;re seeing now is things are</text>
  <text start="113.82" dur="5.189">really starting to accelerate when we</text>
  <text start="116.909" dur="3.901">look at store closings we are</text>
  <text start="119.009" dur="3.661">continually seeing more and more of</text>

  <text start="130.079" dur="4.201">going to be about 3500 stores closing</text>
  <text start="132.299" dur="4.861">and we need to think about what is</text>
  <text start="134.28" dur="5.489">happening here because as they close</text>
  <text start="137.16" dur="5.07">these stores remember how they calculate</text>
  <text start="139.769" dur="4.771">retail sales they don&amp;#39;t just cut them</text>
  <text start="142.23" dur="4.8">off and stop them and say okay retail</text>
  <text start="144.54" dur="3.99">has just stopped they wean them off over</text>
  <text start="147.03" dur="5.19">time to make it look like the economy</text>
  <text start="148.53" dur="6.929">still chugging along so in reality the</text>
  <text start="152.22" dur="5.76">economy is doing ten times worse than</text>
  <text start="155.459" dur="4.981">what they&amp;#39;re really saying because when</text>
  <text start="157.98" dur="4.65">the store closes that&amp;#39;s it the sales</text>
  <text start="160.44" dur="5.609">stop I mean we see RadioShack&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="162.63" dur="7.53">pretty much done Sears done JC Penney&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="166.049" dur="7.53">done payless shoes done all these stores</text>
  <text start="170.16" dur="5.939">they&amp;#39;re just continually closing and a</text>
  <text start="173.579" dur="6.211">lot of individuals are looking for work</text>
  <text start="176.099" dur="4.951">and they cannot find jobs and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="179.79" dur="2.79">seeing at this point</text>
  <text start="181.05" dur="4.41">is that there are so many indicators</text>
  <text start="182.58" dur="6.03">showing us and flashing a red signal</text>
  <text start="185.46" dur="6.57">saying we are in a recession we are in a</text>
  <text start="188.61" dur="5.58">recession now we can see by looking at</text>
  <text start="192.03" dur="4.08">housing we can see by looking at the</text>
  <text start="194.19" dur="4.35">auto industry we can see by looking at</text>
  <text start="196.11" dur="4.38">the GDP numbers we can see by looking at</text>
  <text start="198.54" dur="5.61">what&amp;#39;s really going on we can see that</text>
  <text start="200.49" dur="5.94">things are rapidly breaking down now and</text>
  <text start="204.15" dur="4.08">there&amp;#39;s no stopping it it&amp;#39;s just going</text>
  <text start="206.43" dur="3.36">to continually break down it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="208.23" dur="4.11">matter what the stock market does it can</text>
  <text start="209.79" dur="6">go to 1 million at this point because</text>
  <text start="212.34" dur="6.27">when most of the stores are closed when</text>
  <text start="215.79" dur="5.43">GDP is a negative territory and people</text>
  <text start="218.61" dur="5.37">are looking for jobs and the debt</text>
  <text start="221.22" dur="4.32">ceiling is hit and even if we take on</text>
  <text start="223.98" dur="4.58">more debt it makes no difference because</text>
  <text start="225.54" dur="5.97">we&amp;#39;re stuck in the same situation</text>
  <text start="228.56" dur="5.11">subprime auto loans and this was a big</text>
  <text start="231.51" dur="4.56">force behind the booming car sales in</text>
  <text start="233.67" dur="5.94">recent years are getting crushed by</text>
  <text start="236.07" dur="5.28">default it always comes back to haunt</text>
  <text start="239.61" dur="3.57">you later on everyone&amp;#39;s eggs all look</text>
  <text start="241.35" dur="3.69">the economy is doing well look at the</text>
  <text start="243.18" dur="5.43">car sales letters but you have to look</text>
  <text start="245.04" dur="5.61">at the underlying factor of why this was</text>
  <text start="248.61" dur="4.92">driven and why it has been pushed so</text>
  <text start="250.65" dur="6.36">high I mean think about 2006 think about</text>
  <text start="253.53" dur="5.25">2007 even go back to 2005 even further</text>
  <text start="257.01" dur="3.36">back than that when everyone was looking</text>
  <text start="258.78" dur="3.329">at the housing working on the Wow look</text>
  <text start="260.37" dur="3.21">it&amp;#39;s really doing well people thought</text>
  <text start="262.109" dur="2.971">their houses who they you know they</text>
  <text start="263.58" dur="2.82">bought houses at four hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="265.08" dur="3.69">five hundred thousand they thought it</text>
  <text start="266.4" dur="4.29">was going to go to a million 1.1 million</text>
  <text start="268.77" dur="4.35">and then all of a sudden the housing</text>
  <text start="270.69" dur="4.44">market crashed the reason for that is</text>
  <text start="273.12" dur="3.78">because no one was looking inside of</text>
  <text start="275.13" dur="4.95">what was really going on what was the</text>
  <text start="276.9" dur="5.31">underlying motive of pushing all this up</text>
  <text start="280.08" dur="3.57">and no one really looked at that they</text>
  <text start="282.21" dur="4.89">didn&amp;#39;t realize that the underlying</text>
  <text start="283.65" dur="6.24">motive was fake phony and forth it with</text>
  <text start="287.1" dur="5.28">a house of cards and one that once that</text>
  <text start="289.89" dur="4.32">was taken away the whole thing was going</text>
  <text start="292.38" dur="5.67">to come crumbling down this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="294.21" dur="6.42">happening right now and those loans that</text>
  <text start="298.05" dur="4.07">were originated between 2013 and 2015</text>
  <text start="300.63" dur="4.35">I&amp;#39;m talking about the automobile loans</text>
  <text start="302.12" dur="5.74">during this these are all subprime loans</text>
  <text start="304.98" dur="4.29">they were surging because the</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="3.9">underwriting standards became you know</text>
  <text start="309.27" dur="4.35">loosey-goosey and we can see what</text>
  <text start="311.76" dur="3.05">happened was they were doing the same</text>
  <text start="313.62" dur="3.32">thing as</text>
  <text start="314.81" dur="5.37">the subprime securities in real estate</text>
  <text start="316.94" dur="5.97">auto under order lenders repackage their</text>
  <text start="320.18" dur="5.459">loans into asset backed securities abss</text>
  <text start="322.91" dur="4.89">and they sold them as bonds to</text>
  <text start="325.639" dur="4.921">yield-hungry institutional investors</text>
  <text start="327.8" dur="4.98">fitch ratings which rate auto lenders</text>
  <text start="330.56" dur="4.859">and auto loan ABS just reported on the</text>
  <text start="332.78" dur="5.13">state of the industry the Fitch auto ABS</text>
  <text start="335.419" dur="5.161">indices show that 60 Plus date</text>
  <text start="337.91" dur="4.41">delinquencies were relatively low for</text>
  <text start="340.58" dur="4.29">prime auto loan at the end of the fourth</text>
  <text start="342.32" dur="4.77">quarter but these subprime loans they</text>
  <text start="344.87" dur="6.54">searched the five percent of outstanding</text>
  <text start="347.09" dur="7.079">balances the highest since 2008 now net</text>
  <text start="351.41" dur="5.7">charge-offs show a similar scenario only</text>
  <text start="354.169" dur="5.461">worse net charge-offs from prime loans</text>
  <text start="357.11" dur="5.82">tick up to still low point seven five</text>
  <text start="359.63" dur="5.91">percent of these outstanding balances</text>
  <text start="362.93" dur="4.68">but net charge-offs from subprime loans</text>
  <text start="365.54" dur="6.27">searched at 10.5 percent the highest</text>
  <text start="367.61" dur="5.94">since 2008 now why is this so important</text>
  <text start="371.81" dur="3.78">for the industry as a whole not just</text>
  <text start="373.55" dur="3.6">lenders in their investors lenders are</text>
  <text start="375.59" dur="3.87">starting to feel the bite of those</text>
  <text start="377.15" dur="4.95">losses that are made worse by extending</text>
  <text start="379.46" dur="4.74">loan terms higher to loan value ratios a</text>
  <text start="382.1" dur="5.55">higher proportion of subprime loans more</text>
  <text start="384.2" dur="5.94">negative equity for longer and and hence</text>
  <text start="387.65" dur="5.28">the subprime default in net charge-offs</text>
  <text start="390.14" dur="5.55">that are soaring to crisis levels so</text>
  <text start="392.93" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re feeling it right now and if we</text>
  <text start="395.69" dur="5.49">look at the housing market right now we</text>
  <text start="398.24" dur="5.489">see pretty much the same thing is going</text>
  <text start="401.18" dur="5.209">on that we saw back in two thousand</text>
