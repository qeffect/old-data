  <text start="109.37" dur="4.47">spreading all throughout Europe it here</text>
  <text start="112.19" dur="5.13">in the United States what are we seeing</text>

  <text start="117.32" dur="3.36">numbers that the government wants us to</text>
  <text start="118.88" dur="3.21">believe they used to have the stock</text>
  <text start="120.68" dur="2.79">market where all eyes were on that</text>
  <text start="122.09" dur="2.46">because it continually went up up we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="123.47" dur="2.61">seeing it&amp;#39;s starting to come down a</text>
  <text start="124.55" dur="2.94">little bit doesn&amp;#39;t mean that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="126.08" dur="3.84">going to try to push it back up which</text>
  <text start="127.49" dur="5.219">they most likely will try to do and it</text>
  <text start="129.92" dur="6.239">seems like the Empire Fed manual</text>
  <text start="132.709" dur="6.54">manufacturing has plunged now from</text>
  <text start="136.159" dur="3.731">five-year highs to six months lows in</text>
  <text start="139.249" dur="3.281">one</text>
  <text start="139.89" dur="5.67">months Empire fed manufacturing missed</text>
  <text start="142.53" dur="7.05">expectations by the most since jun 2010</text>
  <text start="145.56" dur="5.85">as new orders collapse now in the retail</text>
  <text start="149.58" dur="5.4">market we have to understand they</text>
  <text start="151.41" dur="7.08">include auto sales they include fuel and</text>
  <text start="154.98" dur="5.19">I mean gas and oil in retail sales now</text>
  <text start="158.49" dur="3.84">when retail sales are doing well they</text>
  <text start="160.17" dur="4.14">always mention yes retails are doing</text>
  <text start="162.33" dur="4.8">well but they don&amp;#39;t say oh the prices of</text>
  <text start="164.31" dur="5.1">gas has gone up or things like that when</text>
  <text start="167.13" dur="4.26">retail sales are doing bad they always</text>
  <text start="169.41" dur="4.02">say well you know the gas prices have</text>
  <text start="171.39" dur="4.23">come down and this is why retails doing</text>
  <text start="173.43" dur="3.99">much much worse than it normally would</text>
  <text start="175.62" dur="4.44">be doing but when we look through all of</text>
  <text start="177.42" dur="3.599">that and the propaganda that the</text>
  <text start="180.06" dur="2.82">corporate media and the federal</text>
  <text start="181.019" dur="4.951">government is putting out there we see</text>
  <text start="182.88" dur="5.88">well that&amp;#39;s not really true September</text>
  <text start="185.97" dur="5.34">retail sales were arguably the worst of</text>
  <text start="188.76" dur="4.8">the year US consumer loaded up on debt</text>
  <text start="191.31" dur="4.02">in the spring and summer the payback</text>
  <text start="193.56" dur="4.02">hangover has finally hit with the</text>
  <text start="195.33" dur="4.29">payment due and the mail resulting in a</text>
  <text start="197.58" dur="4.8">collapse and revolving credit as</text>
  <text start="199.62" dur="5.339">reported previously and as the September</text>
  <text start="202.38" dur="5.07">retail sales just confirmed headline</text>
  <text start="204.959" dur="4.171">retail sales minus point three percent</text>
  <text start="207.45" dur="4.68">missing expectations of Oh point one</text>
  <text start="209.13" dur="5.699">percent decline and down from the point</text>
  <text start="212.13" dur="5.579">six percent in August and that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="214.829" dur="6.601">positive point six in August retail</text>
  <text start="217.709" dur="6.481">sales X autos minus 0.2 percent missing</text>
  <text start="221.43" dur="5.69">expectations of positive point two</text>

  <text start="230.7" dur="5.879">sales X autos and gas down minus point</text>
  <text start="233.94" dur="5.76">one percent missing expectations of a</text>
  <text start="236.579" dur="5.761">solid point four percent rebounded down</text>
  <text start="239.7" dur="5.19">from point five percent now here are the</text>
  <text start="242.34" dur="5.459">biggest mrs. right now in the retail</text>
  <text start="244.89" dur="5.37">sector clothing stores drop by negative</text>

  <text start="263.31" dur="6.06">so we can see retail is really being hit</text>
  <text start="266.61" dur="6">hard at this time we can see right now</text>
  <text start="269.37" dur="4.35">there are a lot of stores closing we</text>
  <text start="272.61" dur="4.08">understand see</text>
  <text start="273.72" dur="5.04">kmart jcpenney radio shack and many</text>
  <text start="276.69" dur="3.45">other retailers are hoping that this</text>
  <text start="278.76" dur="3.9">holiday season is going to be fantastic</text>
  <text start="280.14" dur="4.5">and they&amp;#39;re going to need a fantastic</text>
  <text start="282.66" dur="4.44">holiday season or we are not going to</text>
  <text start="284.64" dur="4.19">see any of these stores any longer and</text>
  <text start="287.1" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;re going to see additional stores</text>
  <text start="288.83" dur="4.42">completely going out and we will never</text>
  <text start="291.78" dur="3.66">ever see them again even though they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="293.25" dur="5.04">been around for a very long time they</text>
  <text start="295.44" dur="4.5">will not Mabel to sustain what they have</text>
  <text start="298.29" dur="4.83">right now throughout this holiday season</text>
  <text start="299.94" dur="6.53">because sales are going to be absolutely</text>
  <text start="303.12" dur="6.39">terrible and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="306.47" dur="4.57">goldman sachs and other financial</text>
  <text start="309.51" dur="4.14">institutions are out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="311.04" dur="4.89">already revising the GDP numbers lower</text>
  <text start="313.65" dur="4.83">the bringing it lower Walmart was out</text>
  <text start="315.93" dur="6.54">there and they just cut sales forecast</text>
  <text start="318.48" dur="5.94">by nearly half walmart sees next three</text>
  <text start="322.47" dur="5.84">years profits growth somewhat slower</text>
  <text start="324.42" dur="7.7">walmart sees a fiscal year 16 sales</text>
  <text start="328.31" dur="6.37">growth down by two to four percent</text>
  <text start="332.12" dur="3.82">walmart sees next three years sales to</text>
  <text start="334.68" dur="3.3">grow about two-and-a-half to</text>
  <text start="335.94" dur="4.229">three-and-a-half percent so we can see</text>
  <text start="337.98" dur="5.4">right now they are not looking for a</text>
  <text start="340.169" dur="5.25">very good holiday season going forward</text>
  <text start="343.38" dur="4.59">and they continually revising their</text>
  <text start="345.419" dur="4.951">information and we can see the financial</text>
  <text start="347.97" dur="4.52">institutions are doing this in the same</text>
  <text start="350.37" dur="6.66">way and they&amp;#39;re starting to realize that</text>
  <text start="352.49" dur="6.73">yet it doesn&amp;#39;t look good now in regards</text>
  <text start="357.03" dur="3.69">to real estate what we&amp;#39;re seeing is the</text>
  <text start="359.22" dur="2.94">interest rates have come down and it</text>
  <text start="360.72" dur="3.66">looks like it picked up in mortgage</text>
  <text start="362.16" dur="4.35">applications rose a little bit but</text>
  <text start="364.38" dur="3.84">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this and</text>
  <text start="366.51" dur="3.6">we see this quite often when the</text>
  <text start="368.22" dur="3.78">interest rates come down and if they</text>
  <text start="370.11" dur="4.5">come down quite a bit people rush in and</text>
  <text start="372" dur="5.25">they apply for mortgages where they go</text>
  <text start="374.61" dur="4.41">back up people say I forget it it&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="377.25" dur="4.8">of my league I I just can&amp;#39;t do it right</text>
  <text start="379.02" dur="5.64">now but the gauge of loan requests for</text>
  <text start="382.05" dur="5.76">home purchases a leading indicator of</text>
  <text start="384.66" dur="6.93">home sales fell by point seven percent</text>
  <text start="387.81" dur="6.12">so again real estate not looking good</text>
  <text start="391.59" dur="4.52">whatsoever and as we go throughout this</text>
  <text start="393.93" dur="4.95">year we&amp;#39;re going to see retail</text>
  <text start="396.11" dur="6.13">continually slide we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="398.88" dur="6.21">real estate continually slide and the</text>
  <text start="402.24" dur="5.399">stock market again this is completely</text>
  <text start="405.09" dur="5.039">manipulated they&amp;#39;re pumping in</text>
  <text start="407.639" dur="4.5">as much as they possibly can they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="410.129" dur="4.771">using high-frequency training plunge</text>
  <text start="412.139" dur="5.43">protection just to keep this market</text>
  <text start="414.9" dur="6.15">alive right now and of course they could</text>
  <text start="417.569" dur="5.94">use the Ebola scare to explain away why</text>
  <text start="421.05" dur="6.179">the economy is family now I did a report</text>
  <text start="423.509" dur="6.66">on this about a week ago and we can see</text>
  <text start="427.229" dur="6.631">that right now this might be falling</text>
  <text start="430.169" dur="5.34">into that agenda of Ebola now again</text>
  <text start="433.86" dur="3.989">there&amp;#39;s many other agendas like vaccines</text>
  <text start="435.509" dur="4.801">and other things but right now we can</text>
  <text start="437.849" dur="4.801">see that things are starting to open up</text>
  <text start="440.31" dur="3.389">and we can see what exactly is going on</text>
  <text start="442.65" dur="3.479">here we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch the</text>
  <text start="443.699" dur="5.37">situation very very carefully now china</text>
  <text start="446.129" dur="5.13">and italy they have signed deals worth</text>

  <text start="453.479" dur="4.201">china has made deals with italy because</text>
  <text start="456.09" dur="4.109">what&amp;#39;s happening is they&amp;#39;re realizing</text>
  <text start="457.68" dur="5.459">that listen putting these countries</text>
  <text start="460.199" dur="5.821">further and further into debt imposing</text>

  <text start="474.599" dur="6.421">is more debt so these come countries are</text>

  <text start="753.11" dur="6.99">the whole thing comes tumbling down now</text>
  <text start="756.74" dur="5.64">as we know Obama is pretty much keeping</text>
  <text start="760.1" dur="4.71">the borders open he wants the illegals</text>
  <text start="762.38" dur="5.94">to come in we realize what the agenda is</text>
  <text start="764.81" dur="5.19">we want the illegals to come in he moves</text>
  <text start="768.32" dur="3.72">them around the country to 23 different</text>

  <text start="791.24" dur="3.72">numbers and we can see this is all part</text>
  <text start="793.31" dur="3.9">of the agenda and this is why they want</text>
  <text start="794.96" dur="4.55">the illegals to continually come in but</text>
  <text start="797.21" dur="4.95">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that nearly</text>
  <text start="799.51" dur="5.47">900,000 illegal aliens who have received</text>

  <text start="814.94" dur="5.839">can see right now that none of these</text>
  <text start="817.4" dur="6.24">illegals are pretty much going to their</text>
  <text start="820.779" dur="5.231">to the courts they&amp;#39;re not showing up</text>
  <text start="823.64" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re not abiding by the law because</text>
  <text start="826.01" dur="2.97">they want to stay in this country so</text>
  <text start="827.69" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re hiding they&amp;#39;re moving to</text>
  <text start="828.98" dur="3.96">different areas and again the Obama</text>
  <text start="831.23" dur="3.45">administration really wants to keep them</text>
  <text start="832.94" dur="4.47">in this country because it makes all</text>
  <text start="834.68" dur="5.07">have his programs look really good the</text>
  <text start="837.41" dur="4.71">main corporations want these illegals in</text>
  <text start="839.75" dur="4.11">here because it&amp;#39;s cheap labor and again</text>
  <text start="842.12" dur="3.96">if you really look at it the people do</text>
  <text start="843.86" dur="3.93">not want the illegals in here and this</text>
  <text start="846.08" dur="3.84">is why Obama is waiting for after the</text>
  <text start="847.79" dur="3.57">elections to sign the executive order</text>
  <text start="849.92" dur="3.18">because he realizes if he signs it</text>
  <text start="851.36" dur="4.47">before the people are going to look at</text>
  <text start="853.1" dur="5.97">this and say no no no no we do not want</text>

  <text start="859.07" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s not the people that want this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="861.11" dur="5.7">the actual corporations that want the</text>

  <text start="1326.05" dur="3.99">will say okay let&amp;#39;s start using this</text>
  <text start="1327.52" dur="4.65">test and let&amp;#39;s see if how it works in</text>
  <text start="1330.04" dur="3.45">the real world and this would be</text>
  <text start="1332.17" dur="3.81">something that we definitely definitely</text>
  <text start="1333.49" dur="4.92">need it would be a very good screening</text>

  <text start="1341.41" dur="5.43">those people you are</text>
  <text start="1344.14" dur="7.38">out there should be prepared for</text>

  <text start="1372.07" dur="4.05">control it anymore but I do have some</text>

  <text start="2016.85" dur="4.35">weapons were manufactured in 1980 when</text>
  <text start="2019.61" dur="4.5">the US and its allies were actively</text>
  <text start="2021.2" dur="4.17">supplying chemical agents to Saddam so</text>
  <text start="2024.11" dur="3.12">basically they didn&amp;#39;t have any problems</text>
  <text start="2025.37" dur="4.74">supplying chemical agents of Saddam</text>
  <text start="2027.23" dur="5.07">having Saddam use it on various groups</text>
  <text start="2030.11" dur="4.35">but they do have a problem of Assad</text>
  <text start="2032.3" dur="4.23">using chemical weapons or having</text>
  <text start="2034.46" dur="5.61">chemical weapons so it&amp;#39;s kind of a</text>
  <text start="2036.53" dur="5.91">double standard there and of course did</text>
  <text start="2040.07" dur="4.5">they really find this were they always</text>
  <text start="2042.44" dur="5.34">there because there are many different</text>
  <text start="2044.57" dur="6.09">documents stating that there were no</text>
  <text start="2047.78" dur="5.76">weapons of mass destruction found in</text>
  <text start="2050.66" dur="5.16">Iraq not even chemical weapons and</text>
  <text start="2053.54" dur="5.52">there&amp;#39;s other documents and I posted</text>
  <text start="2055.82" dur="4.95">them on the site here it&amp;#39;s a PDF you can</text>
  <text start="2059.06" dur="3.45">take a look where it says no there is</text>
  <text start="2060.77" dur="3.74">absolutely no weapons of mass</text>
  <text start="2062.51" dur="4.74">destruction they couldn&amp;#39;t find anything</text>
  <text start="2064.51" dur="5.92">anywhere in the country now of course if</text>
  <text start="2067.25" dur="7.23">this is a stockpile from 1980 or so it</text>
  <text start="2070.43" dur="6.36">is very fragile you can&amp;#39;t really touch</text>
  <text start="2074.48" dur="5.16">it a lot of these soldiers who found it</text>
  <text start="2076.79" dur="4.23">became sick its mustard gas and of</text>
  <text start="2079.64" dur="3.42">course they&amp;#39;re saying the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="2081.02" dur="4.2">is using this but again this would</text>
  <text start="2083.06" dur="4.47">pretty much have a devastating effect on</text>
  <text start="2085.22" dur="6.12">themselves and it looks like this story</text>
  <text start="2087.53" dur="6.78">is put into place to try to cover up how</text>
  <text start="2091.34" dur="5.25">the Islamic state actually got chemical</text>
  <text start="2094.31" dur="4.38">weapons and how they&amp;#39;re using it in</text>
  <text start="2096.59" dur="4.65">Syria and it&amp;#39;s just very interesting and</text>
  <text start="2098.69" dur="3.99">how this all of a sudden just came out</text>
  <text start="2101.24" dur="6.03">in the nick of time and they just</text>
  <text start="2102.68" dur="6.81">decided to reveal this now the united</text>
  <text start="2107.27" dur="4.8">states government is out there and</text>
  <text start="2109.49" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re saying listen it looks like</text>
  <text start="2112.07" dur="4.47">syria is good with their chemical</text>
  <text start="2114.17" dur="4.47">weapons they&amp;#39;re saying that you know</text>
  <text start="2116.54" dur="4.23">what the discrepancies in the chemical</text>
  <text start="2118.64" dur="3.45">weapons is not that big of a deal and of</text>
  <text start="2120.77" dur="2.94">course the reason why they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="2122.09" dur="5.28">at this point is because they can&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="2123.71" dur="6.87">anywhere with it Assad has no chemical</text>
  <text start="2127.37" dur="4.89">weapons they&amp;#39;ve trying so many different</text>
  <text start="2130.58" dur="5.04">types of propaganda to say that he</text>
  <text start="2132.26" dur="6.03">didn&amp;#39;t reveal the chemical weapon areas</text>
  <text start="2135.62" dur="4.05">which he just did they really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2138.29" dur="3.84">produce anything they didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="2139.67" dur="3.939">anything in there he handed over all the</text>
  <text start="2142.13" dur="3.07">chemical weapons and they</text>
  <text start="2143.609" dur="3.99">continually tried to go down this route</text>
  <text start="2145.2" dur="4.68">but it really isn&amp;#39;t working so it looks</text>
  <text start="2147.599" dur="4.291">like now maybe they&amp;#39;ll be going with war</text>
  <text start="2149.88" dur="4.649">crimes because they do have Caesar in</text>
  <text start="2151.89" dur="4.59">Congress showing pictures from a</text>
  <text start="2154.529" dur="4.141">hospital but of course this is not proof</text>
  <text start="2156.48" dur="4.65">this is after the effects we have no</text>
  <text start="2158.67" dur="4.29">idea where all this was where all this</text>
  <text start="2161.13" dur="3.479">has occurred and again this is how the</text>
  <text start="2162.96" dur="3.569">United States does is they do only show</text>
  <text start="2164.609" dur="4.111">the pictures of what happened but</text>
  <text start="2166.529" dur="5.401">there&amp;#39;s no evidence of where it happened</text>
  <text start="2168.72" dur="5.069">or who made it happen and again they</text>
  <text start="2171.93" dur="4.139">might be trying the war crime route</text>
  <text start="2173.789" dur="6.33">because they can&amp;#39;t get anything on the</text>
  <text start="2176.069" dur="6.51">chemical weapons point of view here now</text>
  <text start="2180.119" dur="4.051">Iran is out there and they have lashed</text>
  <text start="2182.579" dur="3.901">out at the Western countries for</text>
  <text start="2184.17" dur="4.589">supporting terrorism in the region and</text>
  <text start="2186.48" dur="5.73">renewed Iran support for political</text>
  <text start="2188.759" dur="6.03">solution in the crisis in Syria Syria is</text>
  <text start="2192.21" dur="5.909">out there and they are saying listen we</text>
  <text start="2194.789" dur="5.431">completely categorically reject calls</text>
  <text start="2198.119" dur="4.65">for the creation of buffer zones on its</text>
  <text start="2200.22" dur="5.039">territory saying it would treat any such</text>
  <text start="2202.769" dur="4.861">bid as an act of aggression the Turkish</text>
  <text start="2205.259" dur="5.1">attempts to establish a buffer zone on</text>
  <text start="2207.63" dur="4.31">the Syrian soil are flagrant violation</text>
  <text start="2210.359" dur="3.9">of the charter of the UN and</text>
  <text start="2211.94" dur="4.72">international law the ministry further</text>
  <text start="2214.259" dur="4.83">denoted the Turkish government since the</text>
  <text start="2216.66" dur="4.439">outset of the crisis in Syria has been</text>
  <text start="2219.089" dur="3.841">systematically carrying out everything</text>
  <text start="2221.099" dur="4.26">that could disrupt series to stability</text>
  <text start="2222.93" dur="5.04">and jeopardize its sovereignty and</text>
  <text start="2225.359" dur="4.351">territorial integrity the statement also</text>
  <text start="2227.97" dur="4.139">stressed that Damascus will take all</text>
  <text start="2229.71" dur="4.049">necessary measures to protect its</text>
  <text start="2232.109" dur="4.2">sovereignty and territorial integrity</text>
  <text start="2233.759" dur="3.81">and we can see right now we know for a</text>
  <text start="2236.309" dur="4.47">fact the United States government</text>
  <text start="2237.569" dur="5.46">central bankers the coalition turkey</text>
  <text start="2240.779" dur="4.411">they want a buffer zone they want a</text>
  <text start="2243.029" dur="3.391">no-fly zone but it&amp;#39;s very difficult to</text>
  <text start="2245.19" dur="2.609">get at this point because the Islamic</text>
  <text start="2246.42" dur="3.659">state does not have an air force and</text>
  <text start="2247.799" dur="4.5">what would be the reason to do this so</text>
  <text start="2250.079" dur="4.17">I&amp;#39;m sure they&amp;#39;re ginning up something</text>
  <text start="2252.299" dur="3.601">else that&amp;#39;s going to come along where</text>
  <text start="2254.249" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;re going to say ah this is why we</text>
  <text start="2255.9" dur="4.08">need the buffer zone and the no-fly zone</text>
  <text start="2258.539" dur="4.23">and we can see they&amp;#39;re moving in that</text>
  <text start="2259.98" dur="5.97">direction we understand that troops are</text>
  <text start="2262.769" dur="5.31">getting ready to be maneuvered into Iraq</text>
  <text start="2265.95" dur="4.02">and again we&amp;#39;re going to see things go</text>
  <text start="2268.079" dur="3.51">hot right after the elections they&amp;#39;re</text>
