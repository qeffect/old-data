  <text start="83.899" dur="8.811">financial news now it looks like Trump</text>
  <text start="87.17" dur="8.94">is making a move to restructure the Fed</text>
  <text start="92.71" dur="5.17">we know that he has to place individuals</text>
  <text start="96.11" dur="5.22">on the board of the Federal Reserve and</text>
  <text start="97.88" dur="6.93">the people that he&amp;#39;s choosing are those</text>

  <text start="104.81" dur="6.02">individuals that believe in gold and he</text>

  <text start="119.81" dur="4.41">other one is Christopher Waller and</text>
  <text start="122.229" dur="4.691">we&amp;#39;re gonna be talking about them in</text>
  <text start="124.22" dur="6.539">just a minute and how they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="126.92" dur="6.539">restructure the Fed if they can get onto</text>
  <text start="130.759" dur="6.331">the board remember the Patriots have a</text>
  <text start="133.459" dur="6.781">plan Q has told us the plan and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="137.09" dur="6.03">watching the plan play out but first we</text>
  <text start="140.24" dur="6.6">need to understand just like back in the</text>
  <text start="143.12" dur="7.32">70s actually before that we had two</text>
  <text start="146.84" dur="5.82">parallel economies the one that everyone</text>
  <text start="150.44" dur="5.1">is was experiencing in the 60s and</text>
  <text start="152.66" dur="5.64">before that where we were still back buy</text>
  <text start="155.54" dur="5.59">gold even though there was a Federal</text>
  <text start="158.3" dur="6.43">Reserve in place since 1913</text>
  <text start="161.13" dur="5.91">we had that economy yes during that</text>
  <text start="164.73" dur="4.97">period of time the Federal Reserve they</text>
  <text start="167.04" dur="6.87">started to create currency outside of</text>
  <text start="169.7" dur="6.43">the gold attachment which made other</text>
  <text start="173.91" dur="4.83">countries look at this and say hmm</text>
  <text start="176.13" dur="4.71">you&amp;#39;re not supposed to be doing that the</text>
  <text start="178.74" dur="5.66">reason why they started to do that was</text>
  <text start="180.84" dur="6.6">because they were creating a parallel</text>
  <text start="184.4" dur="7.36">economy which was the petrodollar system</text>
  <text start="187.44" dur="6.39">which took effect in 1971 when they said</text>
  <text start="191.76" dur="3.5">hey look at all these gold speculators</text>
  <text start="193.83" dur="3.6">we need to come off the gold standard</text>
  <text start="195.26" dur="4.18">closed the gold window and this was</text>
  <text start="197.43" dur="4.14">Nixon and all of a sudden we were</text>
  <text start="199.44" dur="4.2">switched to the petrodollar system but</text>
  <text start="201.57" dur="4.83">during this period of time we had two</text>
  <text start="203.64" dur="3.9">economic systems running parallel one</text>
  <text start="206.4" dur="4.29">was in the shadows</text>
  <text start="207.54" dur="4.95">one was that was one where the people</text>
  <text start="210.69" dur="4.44">were using it and they were using it</text>
  <text start="212.49" dur="6.09">every day today we have the same exact</text>
  <text start="215.13" dur="6.83">thing we have the central bank system</text>
  <text start="218.58" dur="6.93">and all the stats that you hear about</text>
  <text start="221.96" dur="6.64">manufacturing when you hear the</text>
  <text start="225.51" dur="5.67">employment when you hear the stock</text>
  <text start="228.6" dur="6.36">market when you hear credit card debt</text>
  <text start="231.18" dur="6.41">this is all the central bank this is</text>
  <text start="234.96" dur="4.83">their economy this is what everyone is</text>
  <text start="237.59" dur="5.17">experiencing now just like before in</text>
  <text start="239.79" dur="7.5">nineteen prior to 1971 everyone was</text>
  <text start="242.76" dur="7.02">experiencing a sound money economy here</text>
  <text start="247.29" dur="6.21">everyone is experiencing a central bank</text>
  <text start="249.78" dur="7.709">economy now in the shadows we have a</text>
  <text start="253.5" dur="7.47">parallel system the parallel system is</text>
  <text start="257.489" dur="6.691">being created by the Patriots and it</text>
  <text start="260.97" dur="5.16">will be back by sound money and we will</text>
  <text start="264.18" dur="3.92">not have the central bank there will be</text>
  <text start="266.13" dur="6.54">checks and balances to make sure that</text>
  <text start="268.1" dur="6.96">everything is accounted for we don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="272.67" dur="6.18">that economy just yet they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="275.06" dur="8.5">structuring the entire system right now</text>
  <text start="278.85" dur="7.86">and Trump is continually making moves to</text>
  <text start="283.56" dur="7.41">make this happen and the only way this</text>
  <text start="286.71" dur="8.31">can happen is to have inside people in</text>
  <text start="290.97" dur="6.39">the Fed and allow them to</text>
  <text start="295.02" dur="4.799">push their agenda to restructure the</text>
  <text start="297.36" dur="3.51">entire system we&amp;#39;ll be talking about</text>
  <text start="299.819" dur="3.6">that in just a minute</text>
  <text start="300.87" dur="4.38">but let&amp;#39;s start off with the central</text>
  <text start="303.419" dur="4.441">bank economy which we&amp;#39;re experiencing</text>
  <text start="305.25" dur="4.74">right now now what does Trump of the</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="5.19">Patriots have to do they need to keep</text>
  <text start="309.99" dur="6.51">this system operational they can&amp;#39;t let</text>
  <text start="313.05" dur="6.089">it collapse if it collapses we have a</text>
  <text start="316.5" dur="4.44">major problem here so Trump with the</text>
  <text start="319.139" dur="4.101">Patriots they&amp;#39;re gonna do whatever they</text>
  <text start="320.94" dur="5.61">need to do to keep the system</text>
  <text start="323.24" dur="6.85">operational and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="326.55" dur="5.76">doing that&amp;#39;s why Trump is continually</text>
  <text start="330.09" dur="5.009">pointing at the Fed contradicting the</text>
  <text start="332.31" dur="6.71">Fed and telling the Fed what to do and</text>
  <text start="335.099" dur="6.63">if these two people can get into the Fed</text>
  <text start="339.02" dur="6.369">guess what there&amp;#39;ll be a much easier</text>
  <text start="341.729" dur="6.481">time but when we look at the central</text>
  <text start="345.389" dur="6.481">bank numbers because we are in a central</text>
  <text start="348.21" dur="5.07">bank economy everything does not look</text>
  <text start="351.87" dur="3.93">great yes if you look at the stock</text>
  <text start="353.28" dur="4.41">market it looks fantastic if you look at</text>
  <text start="355.8" dur="4.5">the fake unemployment numbers it looks</text>
  <text start="357.69" dur="5.279">fantastic if you look at the fake GDP</text>
  <text start="360.3" dur="4.44">numbers it looks fantastic now am i</text>
  <text start="362.969" dur="3.69">saying Trump started to fake these</text>
  <text start="364.74" dur="4.47">numbers now these numbers have been</text>
  <text start="366.659" dur="5.82">faked for a very long time Trump is just</text>
  <text start="369.21" dur="6.15">using all their weapons against them</text>
  <text start="372.479" dur="5.28">this way they can&amp;#39;t counter whatever he</text>
  <text start="375.36" dur="4.08">says what are they gonna say hey those</text>
  <text start="377.759" dur="3.421">aren&amp;#39;t real he&amp;#39;s gonna say hey this is</text>
  <text start="379.44" dur="2.819">what I&amp;#39;ve been using and this is what</text>
  <text start="381.18" dur="2.639">they told me to use and this is what</text>
  <text start="382.259" dur="4.52">you&amp;#39;ve been using in the past are you</text>
  <text start="383.819" dur="5.361">trying to tell me that this is all fake</text>
  <text start="386.779" dur="4.901">they&amp;#39;re not gonna do that</text>
  <text start="389.18" dur="3.82">so Trump is using all the weapons</text>
  <text start="391.68" dur="4.769">against them and when we look at</text>
  <text start="393" dur="5.909">different numbers like ADP it looks like</text>
  <text start="396.449" dur="4.741">the employment numbers especially for</text>
  <text start="398.909" dur="5.13">small businesses it looks like it is</text>
  <text start="401.19" dur="6.81">completely collapsing and we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="404.039" dur="7.68">seen this since 2008 remember we never</text>
  <text start="408" dur="5.61">really recovered since 2008 all they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="411.719" dur="3.6">been doing is creating this illusion</text>
  <text start="413.61" dur="3.899">which has been getting bigger and bigger</text>
  <text start="415.319" dur="6.061">and bigger just like the bubbles the</text>
  <text start="417.509" dur="7.71">same thing so they were expecting June</text>
  <text start="421.38" dur="6.779">to be fantastic but it only came in at a</text>
  <text start="425.219" dur="7.17">hundred and forty thousand jobs</text>
  <text start="428.159" dur="8.94">now the small businesses employees that</text>
  <text start="432.389" dur="9.51">range from one to nineteen this is very</text>
  <text start="437.099" dur="6.87">very important and the jobs in these</text>
  <text start="441.899" dur="5.07">small businesses they&amp;#39;ve cratered in</text>
  <text start="443.969" dur="5.73">both May and June now why is this</text>
  <text start="446.969" dur="5.97">important why does it matter because the</text>
  <text start="449.699" dur="7.411">small business sector leads the cycle</text>
  <text start="452.939" dur="7.2">and it&amp;#39;s been plunging 61,000 in the</text>
  <text start="457.11" dur="6.089">past two months and we haven&amp;#39;t seen</text>
  <text start="460.139" dur="3.75">anything like this since 2008 now Trump</text>
  <text start="463.199" dur="2.82">knows this</text>
  <text start="463.889" dur="4.74">the Patriots know this why do you think</text>
  <text start="466.019" dur="5.341">they&amp;#39;re continually pushing the Fed to</text>
  <text start="468.629" dur="5.1">cut rates and start stimulus there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="471.36" dur="5.369">reason he wants this to happen because</text>
  <text start="473.729" dur="5.4">he knows that this will allow the system</text>
  <text start="476.729" dur="4.65">to continue on a little bit longer is it</text>
  <text start="479.129" dur="4.47">going to cure the system is it gonna</text>
  <text start="481.379" dur="4.22">make the economy look like it&amp;#39;s the best</text>
  <text start="483.599" dur="4.83">ever no it&amp;#39;s gonna keep the system</text>
  <text start="485.599" dur="6.06">operational that&amp;#39;s what he really wants</text>
  <text start="488.429" dur="6.2">if we look at motor vehicles well new</text>
  <text start="491.659" dur="8.71">vehicle sales fell in the second quarter</text>
  <text start="494.629" dur="8.71">sales for 2019 dropped to 1999 levels so</text>
  <text start="500.369" dur="5.34">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is new vehicles</text>
  <text start="503.339" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;ve been dropping if we look at Ford</text>
  <text start="505.709" dur="8.18">they&amp;#39;ve dropped by 4.1 percent if we</text>
  <text start="509.069" dur="7.38">look at GM 1.5 percent Toyota 0.9% and</text>
  <text start="513.889" dur="5.291">many other manufacturers have also</text>
  <text start="516.449" dur="4.89">dropped if we look at manufacturing</text>
  <text start="519.18" dur="2.639">we&amp;#39;re seeing the same exact thing there</text>
  <text start="521.339" dur="4.44">remember</text>
  <text start="521.819" dur="6.57">the manufacturing base here is still the</text>
  <text start="525.779" dur="5.191">central bank manufacturing base Trump</text>
  <text start="528.389" dur="5.88">right now is deregulating creating tax</text>
  <text start="530.97" dur="6.03">incentives placing tariffs on China</text>
  <text start="534.269" dur="4.5">forcing companies out of this area into</text>
  <text start="537" dur="5.67">other countries and back to the US and</text>
  <text start="538.769" dur="7.341">it does take time what the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="542.67" dur="6.899">doing is they&amp;#39;re setting up the system</text>
  <text start="546.11" dur="5.68">to be operational after the central bank</text>
  <text start="549.569" dur="4.531">system implodes we need to transition</text>
  <text start="551.79" dur="4.56">into something because once the central</text>
  <text start="554.1" dur="4.44">bank system implodes we&amp;#39;re all in</text>
  <text start="556.35" dur="4.86">trouble unless we have something waiting</text>
  <text start="558.54" dur="7.32">in the wings just like if we go back</text>
  <text start="561.21" dur="6.99">1971 what do they do they had a shadow</text>
  <text start="565.86" dur="4.59">economy waiting in the wings because</text>
  <text start="568.2" dur="5.6">they knew that once we came off the gold</text>
  <text start="570.45" dur="5.94">standard they needed to back the dollar</text>
  <text start="573.8" dur="4.15">with something because it was backed by</text>
  <text start="576.39" dur="4.65">nothing the whole thing would just</text>
  <text start="577.95" dur="4.26">collapse so they needed something and</text>
  <text start="581.04" dur="3.39">this is why they created the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="582.21" dur="4.62">system did it hurt</text>
  <text start="584.43" dur="5.31">yes it did unemployment was very very</text>
  <text start="586.83" dur="4.56">high we saw gas lines I mean we saw</text>
  <text start="589.74" dur="3.81">problems in the system</text>
  <text start="591.39" dur="5.1">now remember back then we had very</text>
  <text start="593.55" dur="6.09">little debt we&amp;#39;re coming off a system</text>
  <text start="596.49" dur="6.15">that was backed by sound money going on</text>
  <text start="599.64" dur="4.98">to a system that wasn&amp;#39;t and it took a</text>
  <text start="602.64" dur="5.07">little time for that to get ramped up</text>
  <text start="604.62" dur="5.67">and this is why we had those bumps in</text>
  <text start="607.71" dur="4.17">the road other countries were much worse</text>
  <text start="610.29" dur="5.27">than the United States</text>
  <text start="611.88" dur="6.93">now we&amp;#39;re going from a very debt heavy</text>
  <text start="615.56" dur="6.6">system where the value of the dollar has</text>
  <text start="618.81" dur="5.94">decreased on to a sound money system and</text>
  <text start="622.16" dur="4.69">everything else has been integrated into</text>
  <text start="624.75" dur="4.17">the old central bank system which we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="626.85" dur="4.77">in right now and they have to be very</text>
  <text start="628.92" dur="6.96">careful when we transition yes there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="631.62" dur="7.23">going to be bumps in the road but we</text>
  <text start="635.88" dur="5.82">know that Trump and the Patriots they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="638.85" dur="4.83">been planning this for a very long time</text>
  <text start="641.7" dur="6.6">and they have it all planned out just</text>
  <text start="643.68" dur="7.59">like draining the swamp Trump needs to</text>
  <text start="648.3" dur="5.82">bring in individuals into the Federal</text>
  <text start="651.27" dur="5.46">Reserve he needs to have enough in there</text>
  <text start="654.12" dur="6.03">to restructure the system and he needs</text>
  <text start="656.73" dur="6.48">to have certain individuals within the</text>
  <text start="660.15" dur="6.15">walls of the Fed that believe in sound</text>
  <text start="663.21" dur="7.08">money because they&amp;#39;re gonna rip this</text>
  <text start="666.3" dur="5.52">apart from the inside moving out now</text>
