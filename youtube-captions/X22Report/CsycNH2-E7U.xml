  <text start="35.82" dur="4.129">total this episode is central bankers</text>
  <text start="37.56" dur="4.53">continually pushing war as the economy</text>
  <text start="39.949" dur="3.79">falters and what are we seeing all over</text>
  <text start="42.09" dur="4.5">the corporate media we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="43.739" dur="5.25">consumer confidence is exploding to all</text>
  <text start="46.59" dur="7.71">time new highs and everything is</text>
  <text start="48.989" dur="7.771">fantastic the illusion is here people</text>
  <text start="54.3" dur="4.739">are believing it and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="56.76" dur="5.099">is consumer confidence exploded higher</text>
  <text start="59.039" dur="4.741">to the highest since october two</text>
  <text start="61.859" dur="4.111">thousand seven now we know what happened</text>
  <text start="63.78" dur="5.58">after october two thousand seven we</text>
  <text start="65.97" dur="6.6">completely started to implode leading up</text>
  <text start="69.36" dur="5.399">to october this is the third monthly</text>
  <text start="72.57" dur="5.07">rise in a row and the biggest beat in 13</text>
  <text start="74.759" dur="5.761">months now we have to understand how</text>
  <text start="77.64" dur="5.159">they get this consumer confidence and</text>
  <text start="80.52" dur="5.059">what questions do they actually asked</text>
  <text start="82.799" dur="5.881">when they&amp;#39;re calculating this</text>
  <text start="85.579" dur="6.851">information well what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="88.68" dur="5.46">now is they ask consumers a series of</text>
  <text start="92.43" dur="4.649">five questions and these are the five</text>
  <text start="94.14" dur="5.7">questions appraisal of current business</text>
  <text start="97.079" dur="8.131">conditions expectations regarding</text>
  <text start="99.84" dur="7.97">businesses six months from now appraisal</text>
  <text start="105.21" dur="4.5">of current employment conditions</text>
  <text start="107.81" dur="5.14">expectations regarding employment</text>
  <text start="109.71" dur="5.759">conditions six months hence expectations</text>
  <text start="112.95" dur="5.129">regarding total family income six months</text>
  <text start="115.469" dur="4.891">hence now the respondents answer either</text>
  <text start="118.079" dur="5.04">positive neutral or negative to each</text>
  <text start="120.36" dur="4.53">question and an index is then calculated</text>
  <text start="123.119" dur="5.61">according to the responsible five</text>
  <text start="124.89" dur="6.18">questions now to most Americans these</text>
  <text start="128.729" dur="4.351">questions are too abstract it is like</text>
  <text start="131.07" dur="3.78">asking them what is the weather in the</text>
  <text start="133.08" dur="4.14">United States and what do you expect the</text>
  <text start="134.85" dur="4.44">weather United States to be how does one</text>
  <text start="137.22" dur="3.48">answer this you would probably look out</text>
  <text start="139.29" dur="3.839">the window and describe</text>
  <text start="140.7" dur="5.1">what you see and guess what this is</text>
  <text start="143.129" dur="4.5">exactly what people are doing the</text>
  <text start="145.8" dur="4.56">consumer confidence questions are being</text>
  <text start="147.629" dur="4.531">answered in a similar manner respondent</text>
  <text start="150.36" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t really know how to answer such</text>
  <text start="152.16" dur="3.99">abstract questions as business and</text>
  <text start="154.5" dur="3.93">employment conditions so they describe</text>
  <text start="156.15" dur="5.43">what they think is the ultimate economic</text>
  <text start="158.43" dur="5.73">indicator and guess what that is it is</text>
  <text start="161.58" dur="5.73">the stock market people look at the</text>
  <text start="164.16" dur="4.95">stock market to gauge what is happening</text>
  <text start="167.31" dur="4.08">in the economy of the markets going up</text>
  <text start="169.11" dur="4.47">the economy is fine but what people</text>
  <text start="171.39" dur="5.31">don&amp;#39;t understand is the stock market is</text>
  <text start="173.58" dur="6.269">the last indicator that we have</text>
  <text start="176.7" dur="6.78">collapsed and when people see this it is</text>
  <text start="179.849" dur="6.42">way too late the collapse is happening</text>
  <text start="183.48" dur="4.88">businesses are laying off people who are</text>
  <text start="186.269" dur="5.131">not making money repossessed houses</text>
  <text start="188.36" dur="5.8">foreclosures repossessed automobiles it</text>
  <text start="191.4" dur="4.26">all happens once that goes down and that</text>
  <text start="194.16" dur="3.9">is like the signal to all companies</text>
  <text start="195.66" dur="5.4">saying okay you have the right to get</text>
  <text start="198.06" dur="6.179">rid of all these people and start laying</text>
  <text start="201.06" dur="5.399">off in mass and we can see right now we</text>
  <text start="204.239" dur="5.491">have been following all the indicators</text>
  <text start="206.459" dur="6.391">up to the last indicator showing you how</text>
  <text start="209.73" dur="5.729">real estate is not recovering it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="212.85" dur="5.609">actually imploding showing how retail</text>
  <text start="215.459" dur="4.921">sales are a direct reflection on how</text>
  <text start="218.459" dur="4.291">people are working how much money they</text>
  <text start="220.38" dur="5.31">have what they&amp;#39;re spending we can see</text>
  <text start="222.75" dur="4.41">right now all of this is an illusion now</text>
  <text start="225.69" dur="3.389">what&amp;#39;s very interesting there&amp;#39;s a study</text>
  <text start="227.16" dur="4.47">that came out and it&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="229.079" dur="5.22">thirty five percent of Americans facing</text>
  <text start="231.63" dur="4.829">our facing debt collections more than</text>
  <text start="234.299" dur="4.351">thirty five percent of Americans have</text>
  <text start="236.459" dur="3.481">debts and unpaid bills that have been</text>
  <text start="238.65" dur="3.57">reported to collection agencies</text>
  <text start="239.94" dur="5.519">according to a study released Tuesday by</text>
  <text start="242.22" dur="6.139">the Urban Institute these consumers fall</text>
  <text start="245.459" dur="5.911">behind on credit cards hospital bills</text>
  <text start="248.359" dur="6.91">mortgages auto loans student debts and</text>
  <text start="251.37" dur="6.81">many other things now it even includes</text>
  <text start="255.269" dur="4.861">gym membership and cell phone contracts</text>
  <text start="258.18" dur="6.51">and things like that so we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="260.13" dur="7.77">that 77 million Americans right now are</text>
  <text start="264.69" dur="6.599">facing the debt collectors so what does</text>
  <text start="267.9" dur="6.21">this really mean well this is telling us</text>
  <text start="271.289" dur="6.841">that people are</text>
  <text start="274.11" dur="6.6">not making enough money to pay for their</text>
  <text start="278.13" dur="4.41">bills now they most likely were</text>
  <text start="280.71" dur="3.06">unemployed and they try to get another</text>
  <text start="282.54" dur="2.94">job and they couldn&amp;#39;t where they did</text>
  <text start="283.77" dur="3.42">find another job and they were making</text>
  <text start="285.48" dur="3.42">less money and they&amp;#39;ve been trying to</text>
  <text start="287.19" dur="3">sell their home they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="288.9" dur="3.36">whatever they could they have car</text>
  <text start="290.19" dur="4.32">payments and things are getting very</text>
  <text start="292.26" dur="4.65">very rough for them and the study found</text>
  <text start="294.51" dur="4.35">that 35.1 percent of the people with</text>
  <text start="296.91" dur="4.23">credit records have been reported to</text>
  <text start="298.86" dur="5.67">collections for debt that average around</text>
  <text start="301.14" dur="6.54">five thousand dollars based on sep</text>
  <text start="304.53" dur="5.04">tember 2013 records wages have barely</text>
  <text start="307.68" dur="4.26">kept up with inflation during the</text>
  <text start="309.57" dur="3.96">five-year recovery according to labor</text>
  <text start="311.94" dur="3.84">department figures and a separate</text>
  <text start="313.53" dur="6.69">measure by Wells Fargo found that after</text>
  <text start="315.78" dur="5.73">tax income fell for the bottom twenty</text>
  <text start="320.22" dur="3.42">percent of earners during the same</text>
  <text start="321.51" dur="4.53">period so we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="323.64" dur="4.53">people cannot keep up with their bills</text>
  <text start="326.04" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re not making enough money this is</text>
  <text start="328.17" dur="4.89">a direct reflection on to the retail</text>
  <text start="330.39" dur="5.37">market where we&amp;#39;re seeing master closing</text>
  <text start="333.06" dur="4.08">mass layoffs and of course those people</text>
  <text start="335.76" dur="3.48">who are being laid off from businesses</text>
  <text start="337.14" dur="3.54">right now are having a very tough time</text>
  <text start="339.24" dur="3.65">because they&amp;#39;re setting out their</text>
  <text start="340.68" dur="4.71">resumes of course they&amp;#39;re getting their</text>
  <text start="342.89" dur="4.15">severance packages if they have one if</text>
  <text start="345.39" dur="4.74">they don&amp;#39;t they go right on unemployment</text>
  <text start="347.04" dur="5.4">and this is not the same income than</text>
  <text start="350.13" dur="4.65">what the person was making before so it</text>
  <text start="352.44" dur="5.19">makes people uh it makes it much harder</text>
  <text start="354.78" dur="4.41">to survive once all this starts to</text>
  <text start="357.63" dur="3.33">disappear and it takes a little bit of</text>
  <text start="359.19" dur="3.54">time and then all of a sudden people</text>
  <text start="360.96" dur="4.08">become a little bit late on their bills</text>
  <text start="362.73" dur="5.28">they run behind and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="365.04" dur="5.34">is set to send to debt collectors with</text>
  <text start="368.01" dur="4.92">automobiles they can repossess the cars</text>
  <text start="370.38" dur="5.34">banks right now are not really</text>
  <text start="372.93" dur="4.35">foreclosing on the homes they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="375.72" dur="3.36">to touch it at this point they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="377.28" dur="3.6">leaving them off the market I know a</text>
  <text start="379.08" dur="4.29">couple of people who have been living in</text>
  <text start="380.88" dur="4.56">their homes haven&amp;#39;t been paying the</text>
  <text start="383.37" dur="4.92">mortgage and the bank has not come and</text>
  <text start="385.44" dur="4.44">done anything to them now we can see</text>
  <text start="388.29" dur="3.42">that the delinquent debt is</text>
  <text start="389.88" dur="4.65">overwhelmingly concentrated in the</text>
  <text start="391.71" dur="4.02">southern and western states Texas cities</text>
  <text start="394.53" dur="3.29">have a large share of the population</text>
  <text start="395.73" dur="4.23">being reported to collection agencies</text>
  <text start="397.82" dur="5.47">Dallas is around forty four point three</text>
  <text start="399.96" dur="7.07">percent El Paso 44.4 percent Houston</text>
  <text start="403.29" dur="5.93">43.7 percent and San Antonio around four</text>
  <text start="407.03" dur="3.69">four point five percent and this is</text>
  <text start="409.22" dur="2.76">starting to spread all across the</text>
  <text start="410.72" dur="3.63">country and what does this actually tell</text>
  <text start="411.98" dur="5.22">us well this tells us that we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="414.35" dur="4.62">to see a lot of foreclosures we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="417.2" dur="3.44">to see a lot of those automobiles that</text>
  <text start="418.97" dur="4.11">were given to subprime people</text>
  <text start="420.64" dur="7.51">repossessed we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot of</text>
  <text start="423.08" dur="7.47">people living on the streets and as the</text>
  <text start="428.15" dur="4.74">credit gets worse and worse and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="430.55" dur="3.81">sent to more more debt collectors the</text>
  <text start="432.89" dur="4.38">amount of people that have disposable</text>
  <text start="434.36" dur="4.89">income completely is gone now people</text>
  <text start="437.27" dur="3.27">have to pay in cash and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="439.25" dur="3.96">seeing right now in the retail market</text>
  <text start="440.54" dur="4.98">and the real estate market is that</text>
  <text start="443.21" dur="4.77">people are not Irving earning enough to</text>
  <text start="445.52" dur="4.77">save that type of money to go out and</text>
  <text start="447.98" dur="4.32">have that disposable income to purchase</text>
  <text start="450.29" dur="4.41">goods and it&amp;#39;s all starting to catch up</text>
  <text start="452.3" dur="5.67">right now now a lot of people say that</text>
  <text start="454.7" dur="5.85">you know um the retail market their</text>
  <text start="457.97" dur="5.1">stores aren&amp;#39;t doing well because online</text>
  <text start="460.55" dur="4.74">sales are just fantastic and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="463.07" dur="4.11">there everyone is going to online well</text>
  <text start="465.29" dur="4.64">if that is the case then why during the</text>
  <text start="467.18" dur="6.54">winter monster and Christmas ups saying</text>
  <text start="469.93" dur="6.55">they had kind of a loss going on during</text>
  <text start="473.72" dur="5.22">that time period and now coming into the</text>
  <text start="476.48" dur="4.74">second quarter here profits dropped</text>
  <text start="478.94" dur="5.01">around fifty eight percent now if</text>
  <text start="481.22" dur="5.25">everyone was ordering online these</text>
  <text start="483.95" dur="5.64">shipping companies would be making huge</text>
  <text start="486.47" dur="6.17">profits but we&amp;#39;re not even seeing that</text>
  <text start="489.59" dur="6.6">online sales not moving up</text>
  <text start="492.64" dur="6.67">brick-and-mortar sales not moving up</text>
  <text start="496.19" dur="5.46">we&amp;#39;re seeing a total decline of people</text>
  <text start="499.31" dur="4.29">spending their money in these areas</text>
  <text start="501.65" dur="5.3">that&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;re either unemployed</text>
  <text start="503.6" dur="6.72">or underemployed now it looks like</text>
  <text start="506.95" dur="6.58">kellogg&amp;#39;s is going to be closing a plant</text>
  <text start="510.32" dur="8.1">in Columbus Georgia that&amp;#39;s another 325</text>
  <text start="513.53" dur="8.52">jobs JPMorgan Chase they are now going</text>
  <text start="518.42" dur="5.61">to lay off hundreds of people in their</text>
  <text start="522.05" dur="4.89">tech support jobs now a while back in my</text>
  <text start="524.03" dur="5.52">reports I told you I have a friend my</text>
  <text start="526.94" dur="6.57">wife&amp;#39;s friend that works up in New York</text>
  <text start="529.55" dur="6.78">he is a headhunter that places</text>
  <text start="533.51" dur="4.83">consultants into businesses and just</text>
  <text start="536.33" dur="4.169">last month he said you know something</text>
  <text start="538.34" dur="4.829">for some reason everything</text>
  <text start="540.499" dur="4.95">just dried up he doesn&amp;#39;t understand why</text>
  <text start="543.169" dur="5.58">he doesn&amp;#39;t realize you know he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="545.449" dur="5.76">realizing what&amp;#39;s going on people are not</text>
  <text start="548.749" dur="4.89">setting in jobs to him actually those</text>
  <text start="551.209" dur="5.91">people he&amp;#39;s placed are now being removed</text>
  <text start="553.639" dur="5.64">now he places tech support people just</text>
  <text start="557.119" dur="4.17">like JP Morgan just like yesterday I</text>
  <text start="559.279" dur="4.62">reported on all those tech jobs they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="561.289" dur="5.19">laying off he&amp;#39;s placing consultants this</text>
  <text start="563.899" dur="5.25">is the first line that disappears and</text>
  <text start="566.479" dur="5.49">then they go after the employees most of</text>
  <text start="569.149" dur="5.91">the time corporations will remove the</text>
  <text start="571.969" dur="5.1">consultants then move to the employees</text>
  <text start="575.059" dur="4.44">and then once everything settled down</text>
  <text start="577.069" dur="5.73">they hire back the consultants so they</text>
  <text start="579.499" dur="5.25">don&amp;#39;t have to give them pensions and and</text>
  <text start="582.799" dur="3.99">health benefits and things like that and</text>
  <text start="584.749" dur="4.05">we&amp;#39;re starting to see this right now</text>
  <text start="586.789" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;re heading into August when we move</text>
  <text start="588.799" dur="6.27">into September we&amp;#39;re going to see many</text>
  <text start="590.599" dur="6.51">more businesses laying off now</text>
  <text start="595.069" dur="6.03">case-shiller is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="597.109" dur="7.47">saying that home prices tumble most</text>
  <text start="601.099" dur="5.88">since 2011 this is the second month in a</text>
  <text start="604.579" dur="4.2">row that it missed and we can see right</text>
  <text start="606.979" dur="5.75">now that home prices are starting to</text>
  <text start="608.779" dur="7.74">decline against a forecast rise of 0.3%</text>
  <text start="612.729" dur="5.98">prices dropped in May by three point</text>
  <text start="616.519" dur="5.73">five point three percent this is the</text>
  <text start="618.709" dur="6">biggest drop since 2011 in April</text>

  <text start="627.139" dur="5.85">price declines in May this number stored</text>
  <text start="629.479" dur="6.63">to 14 so we can see now like I said it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="632.989" dur="5.76">starting to spread from a couple of</text>
  <text start="636.109" dur="6.54">places to other cities just like it did</text>
  <text start="638.749" dur="6.12">back in 2007 going into 2008 we saw it</text>
  <text start="642.649" dur="3.99">happen people were trying to sell their</text>
  <text start="644.869" dur="3.69">homes prices we&amp;#39;re coming down people</text>
  <text start="646.639" dur="3.42">were chasing the market and they</text>
  <text start="648.559" dur="4.32">couldn&amp;#39;t understand why real estate</text>
  <text start="650.059" dur="3.93">agents did not understand why of course</text>

  <text start="2051.639" dur="5.881">just like they did in Syria now this is</text>
  <text start="2055.51" dur="4.74">very very interesting and this just</text>
  <text start="2057.52" dur="5.79">proves the point that Hamas was dealing</text>
  <text start="2060.25" dur="5.79">with Russia back in January to extract</text>
  <text start="2063.31" dur="4.68">the natural resources right off the</text>

  <text start="2077.2" dur="4.02">guess what the United States is going to</text>
  <text start="2079.629" dur="5.431">place more sanctions on Russia because</text>
  <text start="2081.22" dur="6.929">of this now it looks like the story of</text>
  <text start="2085.06" dur="6.03">Israel is starting to lose ground here</text>
  <text start="2088.149" dur="6.331">because of all the protests around the</text>
  <text start="2091.09" dur="5.339">world there even protest in Israel and</text>
  <text start="2094.48" dur="4.5">we can see that the story is starting to</text>
  <text start="2096.429" dur="5.251">fall apart about this battle again</text>
  <text start="2098.98" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re hitting anything and everything</text>
  <text start="2101.68" dur="4.59">inside killing innocent women and</text>
  <text start="2103.84" dur="4.92">children and all these bottle rockets</text>
  <text start="2106.27" dur="4.58">are flying back to Israel really are</text>
  <text start="2108.76" dur="7.53">doing absolutely nothing and again</text>
  <text start="2110.85" dur="8.14">Israel attacked first into Gaza and if</text>
  <text start="2116.29" dur="5.85">anyone attacks me I would defend myself</text>
  <text start="2118.99" dur="6.81">any country would defend themselves so</text>
  <text start="2122.14" dur="5.88">yes they fired back and right now what</text>
  <text start="2125.8" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that Israel is caught</text>
  <text start="2128.02" dur="5.01">now and the story of them going into</text>
  <text start="2131.02" dur="4.17">Gaza is starting to fall apart and they</text>
  <text start="2133.03" dur="5.16">need an out and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="2135.19" dur="6.57">now is the u.s. is helping them pave the</text>
  <text start="2138.19" dur="5.49">way for an out will it work who knows</text>
  <text start="2141.76" dur="2.67">but this is what they&amp;#39;re doing the US</text>
  <text start="2143.68" dur="3.33">intelligence</text>
  <text start="2144.43" dur="6.629">has warned that al-qaeda could replace</text>
  <text start="2147.01" dur="5.91">Hamas in the Gaza Strip a leading member</text>
  <text start="2151.059" dur="4.56">of the US intelligence community said</text>
  <text start="2152.92" dur="5.61">the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant</text>
  <text start="2155.619" dur="4.891">could dominate the Gaza Strip Defense</text>
  <text start="2158.53" dur="4.289">Intelligence Agency director michael</text>
  <text start="2160.51" dur="4.46">Flynn said the toppling of a mosque by</text>
  <text start="2162.819" dur="5.401">Israel could facilitate the entry of</text>
  <text start="2164.97" dur="4.99">ISIL or the Islamic state if Hamas were</text>
  <text start="2168.22" dur="3.3">fully destroyed and gone we would</text>
  <text start="2169.96" dur="4.02">probably end up with something much</text>
  <text start="2171.52" dur="5.28">worse Flynn said the region would end up</text>
  <text start="2173.98" dur="4.95">with something much much worse now it</text>
  <text start="2176.8" dur="3.33">really won&amp;#39;t because the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="2178.93" dur="4.83">is controlled by the United States</text>
  <text start="2180.13" dur="5.55">Israel UK and other Arab nations so they</text>
  <text start="2183.76" dur="4.26">know that this will not affect them</text>
  <text start="2185.68" dur="4.29">whatsoever they&amp;#39;re trying to maneuver</text>
  <text start="2188.02" dur="3.539">their way out of this saying you know</text>
  <text start="2189.97" dur="4.17">what maybe we need to leave them intact</text>
  <text start="2191.559" dur="4.441">right now and we can maneuver out</text>
  <text start="2194.14" dur="4.14">because we don&amp;#39;t want something worse in</text>
  <text start="2196" dur="5.04">this area now we&amp;#39;ll have to see if this</text>
  <text start="2198.28" dur="3.75">goes forward and plays out and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2201.04" dur="3.15">have to take a look at this now</text>
  <text start="2202.03" dur="5.48">yesterday I talked about the Islamic</text>
  <text start="2204.19" dur="5.73">state smuggling oil from Syria into</text>
  <text start="2207.51" dur="4.78">Kurdistan and then selling it on the</text>
  <text start="2209.92" dur="3.84">black markets using the US dollar and of</text>
  <text start="2212.29" dur="3.15">course United States has no problems</text>
  <text start="2213.76" dur="3.45">with this whatsoever now you have to</text>
  <text start="2215.44" dur="4.95">remember in my couple reports back I</text>
  <text start="2217.21" dur="5.159">said all oil sales need to go through</text>
  <text start="2220.39" dur="4.26">Baghdad now there was a point in time</text>
  <text start="2222.369" dur="6.271">where the United States central bankers</text>
  <text start="2224.65" dur="6.39">backed Maliki on this when Kurdistan was</text>
  <text start="2228.64" dur="4.949">trying to sell oil not going through</text>
  <text start="2231.04" dur="5.19">Baghdad and the United States said no</text>
  <text start="2233.589" dur="4.921">you have to use Baghdad to sell the oil</text>
  <text start="2236.23" dur="4.05">well right now we understand there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="2238.51" dur="5.28">oil tanker sitting off the coast of</text>
  <text start="2240.28" dur="6.21">Texas and guess what the UN came out and</text>
  <text start="2243.79" dur="5.1">said and I said this yesterday that they</text>
  <text start="2246.49" dur="5.22">will impose sanctions and it is illegal</text>
  <text start="2248.89" dur="6.87">to sell this oil or purchase this oil</text>
  <text start="2251.71" dur="6.72">and from a terrorist group but this oil</text>
  <text start="2255.76" dur="6">tanker was here is still here in Texas</text>
  <text start="2258.43" dur="5.79">and the u.s. now cannot take it so</text>
  <text start="2261.76" dur="7.02">they&amp;#39;ve come out and said listen yeah</text>
  <text start="2264.22" dur="7.32">where we are sending a the National</text>
  <text start="2268.78" dur="5.4">Guard out there US Court has ordered</text>
  <text start="2271.54" dur="5.039">marshals to seize a cargo of oil from</text>
  <text start="2274.18" dur="3.84">Iraqi Kurdistan aboard a tanker off the</text>
  <text start="2276.579" dur="3.181">Texas coast</text>
  <text start="2278.02" dur="3.12">and they&amp;#39;re saying the tanker was</text>
  <text start="2279.76" dur="4.08">carrying about 1 million barrels of</text>
  <text start="2281.14" dur="6.27">crude oil worth about a hundred million</text>
  <text start="2283.84" dur="5.73">dollars and of course Iraq came out and</text>
  <text start="2287.41" dur="5.01">said no this is supposed to go through</text>
  <text start="2289.57" dur="4.17">Baghdad the UN came out and now all of a</text>
  <text start="2292.42" dur="3.84">sudden the United States is out there</text>
  <text start="2293.74" dur="4.98">saying listen yeah we&amp;#39;re not touching</text>
  <text start="2296.26" dur="5.03">this but they had no problem with the</text>
  <text start="2298.72" dur="7.29">smuggling of oil remember back to Libya</text>
  <text start="2301.29" dur="7.06">the SEAL team was on that tanker in no</text>
  <text start="2306.01" dur="4.14">time flat bringing it back this</text>
  <text start="2308.35" dur="4.41">smuggling oil has been going on for</text>
  <text start="2310.15" dur="3.87">quite a while and they&amp;#39;re looking the</text>
  <text start="2312.76" dur="4.38">other way this is how you know the</text>
  <text start="2314.02" dur="6.89">Islamic state is controlled by the US</text>
  <text start="2317.14" dur="6.96">government now the u.s. is banning</text>
  <text start="2320.91" dur="7.18">flights over these six countries right</text>
  <text start="2324.1" dur="6.24">now Ukraine Ethiopia Iraq Libya North</text>
  <text start="2328.09" dur="5.13">Korea and Somalia they&amp;#39;re saying that it</text>
  <text start="2330.34" dur="5.46">is very dangerous to fly planes and we</text>
  <text start="2333.22" dur="4.86">are pretty much banning any type of</text>
  <text start="2335.8" dur="3.96">passenger flight over this area because</text>
  <text start="2338.08" dur="4.17">what happened in Ukraine and of course</text>
  <text start="2339.76" dur="5.25">they were the cause of this too now it</text>
  <text start="2342.25" dur="5.28">looks like Chinese hackers obtained some</text>
  <text start="2345.01" dur="5.79">type of information on the Israeli Iron</text>
  <text start="2347.53" dur="5.4">Dome but what we know is that this is</text>
  <text start="2350.8" dur="5.07">probably a huge amount of propaganda</text>
  <text start="2352.93" dur="7.38">because we have to remember back the</text>
  <text start="2355.87" dur="7.44">United States rousted five Chinese</text>
  <text start="2360.31" dur="4.74">hackers inside the government of China</text>
  <text start="2363.31" dur="4.5">and said these people were committing</text>
  <text start="2365.05" dur="4.92">cyber espionage and cyber attacking of</text>
  <text start="2367.81" dur="4.86">course these are advanced actors you</text>
  <text start="2369.97" dur="4.65">cannot pinpoint and name these people of</text>
  <text start="2372.67" dur="5.22">being the ones who have been doing it</text>
  <text start="2374.62" dur="5.91">quite impossible so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="2377.89" dur="4.53">right now they&amp;#39;re showing that all they</text>
  <text start="2380.53" dur="4.74">want these really dome because it was so</text>
  <text start="2382.42" dur="4.74">successful and look China is the evil</text>
  <text start="2385.27" dur="4.76">one and they&amp;#39;re attacking in cyber</text>
  <text start="2387.16" dur="6.69">attacking at to get this information</text>
  <text start="2390.03" dur="5.95">well this again is propaganda now don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2393.85" dur="4.71">get me wrong all these countries use</text>
  <text start="2395.98" dur="4.71">cyber espionage and they do cyber</text>
  <text start="2398.56" dur="4.65">attacks against each other this is a</text>
  <text start="2400.69" dur="5.4">fact we all know it but to push this out</text>
  <text start="2403.21" dur="6.15">in the mainstream media was done for a</text>
  <text start="2406.09" dur="5.23">specific reason and this was done to</text>
  <text start="2409.36" dur="5.65">demonize China at the</text>
  <text start="2411.32" dur="6.51">time now we can see right now that the</text>
  <text start="2415.01" dur="6.12">Islamic state is being painted as the</text>
  <text start="2417.83" dur="5.34">new poster child for terrorism bagga</text>
  <text start="2421.13" dur="4.43">daddy he&amp;#39;s the center of it is replacing</text>
  <text start="2423.17" dur="5.16">bin Laden and right now it looks like</text>
  <text start="2425.56" dur="6.67">al-qaeda is not carrying the weight</text>
  <text start="2428.33" dur="6.72">right now and it seems like the Islamic</text>
  <text start="2432.23" dur="5.97">state is the new terrorist group and</text>
  <text start="2435.05" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re trying to get rid of al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="2438.2" dur="3.78">slowly because they were the American</text>
  <text start="2440.69" dur="4.17">people and the rest of the world weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2441.98" dur="5.01">affected anymore by al-qaeda it lost the</text>
  <text start="2444.86" dur="4.8">fear factor so they&amp;#39;re moving everything</text>
