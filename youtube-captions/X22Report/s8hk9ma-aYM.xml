  <text start="141.83" dur="3.9">party and he said something very</text>
  <text start="144.17" dur="4.23">interesting he appeared on the King&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="145.73" dur="7.56">own show and he said that the Patriots</text>
  <text start="148.4" dur="7.98">they must end the globalists Drive it is</text>
  <text start="153.29" dur="7.64">now time to end the outsourcing</text>
  <text start="156.38" dur="8.4">decision-making to non elected leaders</text>
  <text start="160.93" dur="7.63">because he said the elites want to see</text>
  <text start="164.78" dur="7.5">the nation-state dissolved and we know</text>
  <text start="168.56" dur="5.7">this he continued on and he said brexit</text>
  <text start="172.28" dur="3.99">is saying we want to govern our own</text>
  <text start="174.26" dur="4.35">country we want to make our own laws we</text>

  <text start="188.03" dur="4.65">election with the European Commission</text>
  <text start="189.68" dur="5.97">you can&amp;#39;t do that why because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="192.68" dur="6.54">not elected and they are controlling</text>
  <text start="195.65" dur="7.4">what the elected governments can or</text>
  <text start="199.22" dur="7.44">can&amp;#39;t do this is the same exact</text>
  <text start="203.05" dur="6.18">structure as the central bank and think</text>
  <text start="206.66" dur="7.65">about it for a second and they were</text>
  <text start="209.23" dur="7.2">using this as a framework to spread this</text>
  <text start="214.31" dur="4.68">around the world</text>
  <text start="216.43" dur="3.07">Faraj has observed that in Hungary in</text>
  <text start="218.99" dur="2.4">Italy</text>
  <text start="219.5" dur="4.65">there&amp;#39;s been a resurgence of</text>
  <text start="221.39" dur="5.64">conservatism and pro-democracy movements</text>
  <text start="224.15" dur="4.35">and expressed a hope that post brexit</text>
  <text start="227.03" dur="3.929">the United Kingdom and European nations</text>
  <text start="228.5" dur="4.31">could trade and cooperate freely as</text>
  <text start="230.959" dur="5.221">neighbors and friends</text>
  <text start="232.81" dur="5.83">he continued we&amp;#39;ve got to end this</text>
  <text start="236.18" dur="4.65">globalist drive to give away the ability</text>
  <text start="238.64" dur="4.68">to determine our own futures the whole</text>
  <text start="240.83" dur="5.28">thing&amp;#39;s effectively bought and paid for</text>
  <text start="243.32" dur="4.889">by a handful of giant multinational</text>
  <text start="246.11" dur="3.99">companies one or two very rich</text>
  <text start="248.209" dur="4.261">individuals and they basically would</text>
  <text start="250.1" dur="4.919">like to see the nation-state almost be</text>
  <text start="252.47" dur="4.44">dissolved it&amp;#39;s why in many ways the</text>
  <text start="255.019" dur="4.561">Trump victory was so important because</text>
  <text start="256.91" dur="5.1">Hillary Clinton was completely sold on</text>
  <text start="259.58" dur="4.649">this European project he added the</text>
  <text start="262.01" dur="6.3">European Union agenda is basically a</text>
  <text start="264.229" dur="6.541">prototype for a bigger form of global</text>
  <text start="268.31" dur="4.169">government and cooperation Clinton</text>
  <text start="270.77" dur="3.78">actually said to her friends in the</text>
  <text start="272.479" dur="4.741">walls in wall street that she wanted</text>
  <text start="274.55" dur="5.55">America to join a hemispheric common</text>
  <text start="277.22" dur="6.509">market because she is a globalist and</text>
  <text start="280.1" dur="6.83">he&amp;#39;s absolutely right if we allowed this</text>
  <text start="283.729" dur="5.791">to continue we would have headed down a</text>
  <text start="286.93" dur="5.47">terrible terrible path and if you notice</text>
  <text start="289.52" dur="5.43">Trump continually is out there and every</text>
  <text start="292.4" dur="4.68">time he talks to a reporter he tells him</text>
  <text start="294.95" dur="3.09">listen if I didn&amp;#39;t step in we&amp;#39;d be in a</text>
  <text start="297.08" dur="3.39">war if I</text>
  <text start="298.04" dur="5.49">step in the market would crash there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="300.47" dur="5.91">reason why he is saying this because</text>
  <text start="303.53" dur="5.49">he&amp;#39;s telling the world the people of the</text>
  <text start="306.38" dur="5.34">United States that this is what would</text>
  <text start="309.02" dur="4.38">happen if the Patriots weren&amp;#39;t in</text>
  <text start="311.72" dur="5.51">control because they already had it</text>
  <text start="313.4" dur="8.52">planned out and now there&amp;#39;s a problem</text>
  <text start="317.23" dur="8.86">they don&amp;#39;t have a plan because they</text>
  <text start="321.92" dur="5.31">didn&amp;#39;t expect Clinton to lose they</text>
  <text start="326.09" dur="5.12">expected her to win</text>
  <text start="327.23" dur="7.11">Trump won the Patriots won and now</text>
  <text start="331.21" dur="6.88">everything is being changed one thing</text>
  <text start="334.34" dur="6.75">that we do know is that this entire</text>
  <text start="338.09" dur="6.39">central bank economy is falling apart</text>
  <text start="341.09" dur="5.37">rapidly Trump noses the Patriots know</text>
  <text start="344.48" dur="7.49">this and this is why they&amp;#39;re moving so</text>
  <text start="346.46" dur="7.8">quickly to redo or reset everything and</text>
  <text start="351.97" dur="4.24">they only have a short period of time to</text>
  <text start="354.26" dur="2.79">do this if we look at some statistics</text>
  <text start="356.21" dur="3.75">here</text>
  <text start="357.05" dur="5.34">Adam data solutions published its twenty</text>
  <text start="359.96" dur="6.3">at second quarter 2019 us home</text>
  <text start="362.39" dur="5.49">affordability report it reveals median</text>
  <text start="366.26" dur="4.05">home prices last quarter weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="367.88" dur="6.51">affordable for the average American and</text>
  <text start="370.31" dur="5.49">74% of the counties analyzed three</text>
  <text start="374.39" dur="4.35">hundred and fifty three of the four</text>
  <text start="375.8" dur="6.12">hundred and eighty counties the average</text>
  <text start="378.74" dur="7.29">American 74% of them couldn&amp;#39;t afford a</text>
  <text start="381.92" dur="7.71">median price home because the central</text>
  <text start="386.03" dur="6.9">bank economy was not designed to benefit</text>
  <text start="389.63" dur="5.73">the people we&amp;#39;re at the end stage here</text>
  <text start="392.93" dur="4.65">and it&amp;#39;s just going to get worse and</text>
  <text start="395.36" dur="8.07">worse and worse and I do believe that</text>
  <text start="397.58" dur="8.88">Trump wants the people to see what the</text>
  <text start="403.43" dur="5.79">central bank is doing this is why he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="406.46" dur="5.52">going to switch it up after the 2020</text>
  <text start="409.22" dur="6.15">elections before the 2020 elections he</text>
  <text start="411.98" dur="7.95">needs the central bank to do exactly</text>
  <text start="415.37" dur="8.52">what he says why because he understands</text>
  <text start="419.93" dur="6.989">that the economy needs the inject the</text>
  <text start="423.89" dur="5.22">injection of the drug of rate cuts and</text>
  <text start="426.919" dur="4.111">stimulus</text>
  <text start="429.11" dur="4.98">because the economy right now is like a</text>
  <text start="431.03" dur="6.18">drug-addict remove both of that it goes</text>
  <text start="434.09" dur="6.509">into withdrawal it collapses you need to</text>
  <text start="437.21" dur="6.269">feed the economy with a rate cut</text>
  <text start="440.599" dur="6.54">multiple rate cuts and stimulus to keep</text>
  <text start="443.479" dur="6.03">the central bank system going this is</text>
  <text start="447.139" dur="5.821">the only thing that will keep the</text>
  <text start="449.509" dur="6.93">central bank system going but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="452.96" dur="6.329">very interesting is that the deep state</text>
  <text start="456.439" dur="5.551">central bank the mainstream media they</text>
  <text start="459.289" dur="5.731">do not want Trump to succeed remember</text>
  <text start="461.99" dur="5.729">they have different plans and everything</text>
  <text start="465.02" dur="6.179">that he tries to do they will counter</text>
  <text start="467.719" dur="6.241">one way or another they will try to gain</text>
  <text start="471.199" dur="4.411">that the economic narrative but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="473.96" dur="5.989">going to fail I mean let&amp;#39;s take for</text>
  <text start="475.61" dur="7.41">instance the trade talks with China now</text>
  <text start="479.949" dur="7.33">Trump mentioned when he was out in the</text>
  <text start="483.02" dur="8.699">g20 that he&amp;#39;s going to allow China to</text>

  <text start="613.65" dur="3.99">compliance is where China recoiled</text>
  <text start="615.87" dur="3.66">because they saw the u.s. is having</text>

  <text start="652.44" dur="4.71">light Hauser told Congress this is the</text>

  <text start="661.02" dur="5.16">now the mainstream media is really not</text>
  <text start="663.78" dur="5.58">going into this they&amp;#39;re keeping this out</text>
  <text start="666.18" dur="5.82">of the discussion because no one has</text>
  <text start="669.36" dur="4.5">ever attempted to structure a</text>

  <text start="801.149" dur="5.88">what CNN is doing this week CNN reported</text>
  <text start="804.779" dur="4.29">that a persistent low interest rate</text>
  <text start="807.029" dur="4.8">policy one pursue by the central banks</text>
