  <text start="143.41" dur="6.6">comes to the White House briefings and</text>
  <text start="146.489" dur="5.411">we see from Esquire magazine said that</text>
  <text start="150.01" dur="3.839">the incoming Trump administration is</text>
  <text start="151.9" dur="4.26">seriously considering a plan to evict</text>
  <text start="153.849" dur="5.581">the press corps from the White House and</text>
  <text start="156.16" dur="4.38">of course all these different</text>
  <text start="159.43" dur="2.61">journalists are out there this is</text>
  <text start="160.54" dur="3.69">ridiculous and all the corporate media</text>
  <text start="162.04" dur="4.44">is out there saying see we knew it</text>
  <text start="164.23" dur="4.53">he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s letting us go well that&amp;#39;s not</text>

  <text start="168.76" dur="5.46">do is expand who is coming into the</text>
  <text start="172.15" dur="5.119">White House briefings they will keep the</text>
  <text start="174.22" dur="7.9">corporate media but they&amp;#39;re going to add</text>
  <text start="177.269" dur="7.311">bloggers the alternative media</text>
  <text start="182.12" dur="6.54">there&amp;#39;s going to be more bloggers more</text>
  <text start="184.58" dur="8.97">vloggers coming in and joining in with</text>
  <text start="188.66" dur="6.93">the corporate media which means this is</text>
  <text start="193.55" dur="4.799">going to be a huge problem for the</text>
  <text start="195.59" dur="6.119">corporate media why you might ask</text>
  <text start="198.349" dur="6.241">because the bloggers and the vloggers</text>
  <text start="201.709" dur="4.801">the alternative media that&amp;#39;s there well</text>
  <text start="204.59" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re gonna report things much</text>
  <text start="206.51" dur="4.589">differently than how the corporate media</text>
  <text start="208.7" dur="3.72">is going to be reporting it the things</text>
  <text start="211.099" dur="3.991">that the corporate media is going to</text>
  <text start="212.42" dur="4.649">leave out are things that the</text>
  <text start="215.09" dur="5.52">alternative media are going to put in</text>
  <text start="217.069" dur="5.131">and the corporate media is not going to</text>
  <text start="220.61" dur="5.159">like this the alternative media doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="222.2" dur="6.66">care there&amp;#39;s no corporate back financing</text>
  <text start="225.769" dur="6.47">most of these bloggers and vloggers well</text>
  <text start="228.86" dur="6.18">we&amp;#39;re funding everything ourselves and</text>
  <text start="232.239" dur="5.321">we could see that this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="235.04" dur="4.199">huge problem for the corporate media who</text>
  <text start="237.56" dur="2.789">continually says that there&amp;#39;s fake news</text>
  <text start="239.239" dur="3.571">out there of course they&amp;#39;re taking this</text>
  <text start="240.349" dur="5.67">term back because they don&amp;#39;t want people</text>
  <text start="242.81" dur="5.31">to understand that they are the fake</text>
  <text start="246.019" dur="4.411">news because the alternative media and</text>
  <text start="248.12" dur="3.51">many people are pointing at the fake</text>
  <text start="250.43" dur="3.33">stories that the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="251.63" dur="4.13">putting out there and this is why they</text>
  <text start="253.76" dur="4.74">don&amp;#39;t like the term fake news anymore</text>
  <text start="255.76" dur="3.43">so this we can see this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="258.5" dur="3.06">big problem</text>
  <text start="259.19" dur="6.539">and of course right off the bat they got</text>
  <text start="261.56" dur="7.05">the entire story completely wrong now we</text>
  <text start="265.729" dur="6.75">see the CIA chief he&amp;#39;s warning Trump to</text>
  <text start="268.61" dur="6.9">watch his words and we see right now</text>
  <text start="272.479" dur="6.62">Trump is saying that the CIA is leaking</text>
  <text start="275.51" dur="6.21">information that they&amp;#39;re the problem and</text>
  <text start="279.099" dur="5.141">the last time somebody went up against</text>
  <text start="281.72" dur="5.16">the CIA was John F Kennedy and we know</text>
  <text start="284.24" dur="6.06">what happened to John F Kennedy but we</text>
  <text start="286.88" dur="6.89">could see at this point is that the CIA</text>
  <text start="290.3" dur="7.28">is kind of threatening Trump right now</text>
  <text start="293.77" dur="7.39">because they want him to fall in line</text>
  <text start="297.58" dur="7">really what they&amp;#39;re saying is listen you</text>
  <text start="301.16" dur="5.37">better play ball or else now remember</text>
  <text start="304.58" dur="4.23">the CIA director he&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="306.53" dur="6.42">replaced by Trump&amp;#39;s pink which is Mike</text>
  <text start="308.81" dur="7.03">Pompeo but Pompeo I&amp;#39;m not sure which way</text>
  <text start="312.95" dur="4.78">he&amp;#39;s going to move on these situations</text>
  <text start="315.84" dur="4.29">we can see that he&amp;#39;s moving towards</text>
  <text start="317.73" dur="3.3">Russian aggression and once he gets into</text>
  <text start="320.13" dur="3.87">the CIA</text>
  <text start="321.03" dur="6.12">we know those in the deep State</text>
  <text start="324" dur="5.669">well they protect themselves they take</text>
  <text start="327.15" dur="5.64">control of the situation they blackmail</text>
  <text start="329.669" dur="6.72">certain individuals into doing what they</text>
  <text start="332.79" dur="6.93">want so we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this goes</text>
  <text start="336.389" dur="6.691">and we&amp;#39;ll have to see you know is Trump</text>
  <text start="339.72" dur="5.75">going to play ball or is something else</text>
  <text start="343.08" dur="5.52">going to happen because we know already</text>
  <text start="345.47" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re worried about him he&amp;#39;s a loose</text>
  <text start="348.6" dur="5.43">cannon this is why they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="350.51" dur="6.07">interrupt the inauguration this is why</text>
  <text start="354.03" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to get him out of</text>
  <text start="356.58" dur="4.71">the White House and I don&amp;#39;t think this</text>
  <text start="358.26" dur="4.83">is done at all I think they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="361.29" dur="4.08">continually try even after the</text>
  <text start="363.09" dur="5.85">inauguration I think they&amp;#39;re gonna push</text>
  <text start="365.37" dur="7.41">their agenda forward now former</text>
  <text start="368.94" dur="8.28">newspaper editor who exposed the CIA and</text>
  <text start="372.78" dur="8.48">this is dr. Udo Wolfe cut the former</text>
  <text start="377.22" dur="6.21">German newspaper editor he wrote a book</text>
  <text start="381.26" dur="6.54">which was caught and was a best-seller</text>
  <text start="383.43" dur="7.98">which was titled bought journalists well</text>
  <text start="387.8" dur="8.29">he was killed by the CIA he was found</text>
  <text start="391.41" dur="9.48">dead he was 56 years old he was running</text>
  <text start="396.09" dur="8.49">one of the largest newspapers in Germany</text>
  <text start="400.89" dur="7.2">and he died of heart failure</text>
  <text start="404.58" dur="5.399">now we know the CIA likes to get rid of</text>
  <text start="408.09" dur="6.24">those individuals that are calling them</text>
  <text start="409.979" dur="6.301">out on certain things and they use</text>
  <text start="414.33" dur="3.78">different methods of getting rid of</text>
  <text start="416.28" dur="5.639">people maybe there&amp;#39;s an accident I know</text>
  <text start="418.11" dur="7.8">there&amp;#39;s a device that can cause heart</text>
  <text start="421.919" dur="7.31">failure that the CIA does use and we see</text>
  <text start="425.91" dur="6.99">right now that this is very suspicious</text>
  <text start="429.229" dur="8.681">when you look at who this person is the</text>
  <text start="432.9" dur="10.35">book they wrote and he might have been</text>
  <text start="437.91" dur="7.8">knocked off by the CIA and Trump who is</text>
  <text start="443.25" dur="5.37">going up against the CIA the deep state</text>
  <text start="445.71" dur="5.1">the elite well</text>
  <text start="448.62" dur="4.68">they might eventually say you know what</text>
  <text start="450.81" dur="5.34">he&amp;#39;s not playing ball we&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="453.3" dur="5.94">to get rid of him we see the globalists</text>
  <text start="456.15" dur="5.93">who are having their meeting in Davos</text>
  <text start="459.24" dur="6.66">Switzerland well they&amp;#39;re planning an</text>
  <text start="462.08" dur="5.619">emergency Washington DC meeting in 2017</text>
  <text start="465.9" dur="6.18">to talk about what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="467.699" dur="8.341">about Trump and the globalists are very</text>
  <text start="472.08" dur="5.91">worried about movements around the world</text>
  <text start="476.04" dur="5.12">and when I say movements I mean the</text>
  <text start="477.99" dur="9.03">movements away from globalization and</text>
  <text start="481.16" dur="9.729">the movement towards populism and we see</text>
  <text start="487.02" dur="5.97">there&amp;#39;s a major problem facing Davos one</text>
  <text start="490.889" dur="3.621">is the loss of credibility as the</text>
  <text start="492.99" dur="4.5">majority of people now believe the</text>
  <text start="494.51" dur="6.219">economic and political system is failing</text>
  <text start="497.49" dur="6.48">them and they&amp;#39;re starting to say you</text>
  <text start="500.729" dur="6.241">know something this whole experiment it</text>
  <text start="503.97" dur="7.38">is not working because when we really</text>
  <text start="506.97" dur="8.21">look at this the richest 1% has own more</text>
  <text start="511.35" dur="7.67">wealth than the rest of the planet and</text>
  <text start="515.18" dur="6.729">the rest of the planet is saying we have</text>
  <text start="519.02" dur="4.81">problems because what has happened over</text>
  <text start="521.909" dur="6.12">time is that the wealth has been</text>
  <text start="523.83" dur="8.16">siphoned up to the rich because under</text>
  <text start="528.029" dur="6.271">this globalist model under the central</text>
  <text start="531.99" dur="3.71">banking model which this were that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="534.3" dur="4.05">what it really is</text>
  <text start="535.7" dur="5.53">they put countries into debt</text>
  <text start="538.35" dur="5.75">they steal the hard assets they steal</text>
  <text start="541.23" dur="6.41">the wealth of the country and the people</text>
  <text start="544.1" dur="8.35">suffer for it well throughout history</text>
  <text start="547.64" dur="7.03">when this occurs and you have a huge</text>
  <text start="552.45" dur="4.92">population that is suffering the</text>
  <text start="554.67" dur="5.52">suffering population rises up and that</text>
  <text start="557.37" dur="5.64">suffering population decides to go after</text>
  <text start="560.19" dur="5.16">those individuals that caused the</text>
  <text start="563.01" dur="4.92">problem and we&amp;#39;ve seen it throughout</text>
  <text start="565.35" dur="4.53">history especially when there were kings</text>
  <text start="567.93" dur="3.96">and queens and the rest of their</text>
  <text start="569.88" dur="4.74">subjects were living in poverty and they</text>
  <text start="571.89" dur="4.47">were taxed and taxed and taxed well the</text>
  <text start="574.62" dur="3.33">people rose up and they went to the</text>
  <text start="576.36" dur="3.3">castle and they took the King Queen and</text>
  <text start="577.95" dur="4.23">they beheaded them they said is enough</text>
  <text start="579.66" dur="4.89">is enough we can&amp;#39;t take this anymore</text>
  <text start="582.18" dur="5.28">we saw it here in the US during the</text>
  <text start="584.55" dur="4.56">revolution well you know what you</text>
  <text start="587.46" dur="6.18">continually put pressure on us we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="589.11" dur="6.95">want to be subservient to the king guess</text>
  <text start="593.64" dur="4.819">what happens a revolution occurs and</text>
  <text start="596.06" dur="5.43">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="598.459" dur="7.541">people are saying enough is enough and</text>
  <text start="601.49" dur="7.12">they want a change now the elite guess</text>
  <text start="606" dur="4.83">what they&amp;#39;re not ready for this change</text>
  <text start="608.61" dur="4.5">that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re having the emergency</text>
  <text start="610.83" dur="6.54">meeting because they&amp;#39;re strategizing on</text>
  <text start="613.11" dur="6.57">how to combat this and we&amp;#39;ll have to see</text>
  <text start="617.37" dur="5.339">what they come up with now on friday&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="619.68" dur="5.4">report I mentioned that Trump was</text>
  <text start="622.709" dur="4.921">looking at lifting sanctions for Russia</text>
  <text start="625.08" dur="8.4">and it looks like he&amp;#39;s going to be using</text>
  <text start="627.63" dur="9.87">the sanctions as leverage and he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="633.48" dur="5.31">try to force Russia into reducing their</text>
  <text start="637.5" dur="3.24">nuclear arms</text>
  <text start="638.79" dur="4.56">now of course Russia is gonna say well</text>
  <text start="640.74" dur="5.34">the US has to do the same how well would</text>
  <text start="643.35" dur="4.679">this work I don&amp;#39;t really know but we</text>
  <text start="646.08" dur="4.08">need to look again at the heart of the</text>
  <text start="648.029" dur="6.421">sanctions where did this all come from</text>
  <text start="650.16" dur="6.57">why are they there and by using this as</text>
  <text start="654.45" dur="7.139">leverage this might cause more problems</text>
  <text start="656.73" dur="7.53">than the actual sanctions now it all</text>
  <text start="661.589" dur="5.161">depends on how Putin responds to this if</text>
  <text start="664.26" dur="3.48">this does go further than just Trump</text>
  <text start="666.75" dur="3.27">talking about it</text>
  <text start="667.74" dur="4.71">Putin might say okay you know something</text>
  <text start="670.02" dur="5.16">let&amp;#39;s do this let&amp;#39;s talk deals because</text>
  <text start="672.45" dur="5.37">we can see that Putin he&amp;#39;s a diplomat he</text>
  <text start="675.18" dur="6.36">wants to talk he wants to make deals and</text>
  <text start="677.82" dur="5.37">maybe there will be a deal made but</text>
  <text start="681.54" dur="6.36">we&amp;#39;ll have to wait to see how this turns</text>
  <text start="683.19" dur="7.53">out now Obama is doing one last trick</text>
  <text start="687.9" dur="5.1">before he leaves the White House</text>
  <text start="690.72" dur="5.97">the latest deployment of US troops and</text>
  <text start="693" dur="6.12">tanks to Eastern Europe well it has been</text>
  <text start="696.69" dur="5.55">arranged in a way that circumvents a</text>
  <text start="699.12" dur="5.67">Russia NATO peace deal limiting the</text>
  <text start="702.24" dur="6.18">number of permanent forces in the region</text>
  <text start="704.79" dur="5.25">in general terms it should be noted that</text>
  <text start="708.42" dur="3.539">this deployment is little more than a</text>
  <text start="710.04" dur="3.41">trick to evade the agreement between</text>
  <text start="711.959" dur="3.381">Russia and NATO</text>
  <text start="713.45" dur="6.42">because what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="715.34" dur="6.03">saying it&amp;#39;s part of a joint drill we</text>
  <text start="719.87" dur="4.2">have rotating troops</text>
  <text start="721.37" dur="6.06">there&amp;#39;s nothing permanent there and the</text>
  <text start="724.07" dur="5.64">US uses this type of trick in all</text>
  <text start="727.43" dur="5.04">different types of situation in Iraq for</text>
  <text start="729.71" dur="3.9">instance they made a deal the Unites</text>
  <text start="732.47" dur="3.18">States government central bankers made a</text>
  <text start="733.61" dur="4.8">deal with the Iraqis and they said</text>
  <text start="735.65" dur="5.1">listen you can bring in about 4500</text>

  <text start="1197.92" dur="8.13">they&amp;#39;re saying that this risk is</text>
  <text start="1201.929" dur="7.181">increasing to levels not seen since the</text>
