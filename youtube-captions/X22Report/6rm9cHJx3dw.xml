  <text start="79.72" dur="5.34">port the selling of the airports is part</text>
  <text start="82.75" dur="4.679">of a series of privatizations the Greek</text>
  <text start="85.06" dur="6.24">government has agreed to make as part of</text>
  <text start="87.429" dur="5.19">their bailout agreement and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="91.3" dur="2.55">to see a lot more of this because</text>
  <text start="92.619" dur="4.051">basically this is what the central</text>
  <text start="93.85" dur="5.21">bankers do they place a country into</text>
  <text start="96.67" dur="4.89">debt they continually add on the debt</text>

  <text start="104.409" dur="5.25">decrease we see jobs lost we see people</text>
  <text start="107.979" dur="5.131">living out on the streets then they come</text>
  <text start="109.659" dur="6.291">in for the kill and they start buying up</text>
  <text start="113.11" dur="5.93">the country on pennies on the dollar</text>
  <text start="115.95" dur="7.989">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="119.04" dur="7.09">happened to Greece because they told us</text>
  <text start="123.939" dur="3.621">if we go back to 2008 when they received</text>
  <text start="126.13" dur="5.03">their first tranche of bailout</text>
  <text start="127.56" dur="7.6">everything is fine they&amp;#39;re back on track</text>
  <text start="131.16" dur="6.49">really because fast forward to today it</text>
  <text start="135.16" dur="4.549">seems like there are a lot worse off it</text>
  <text start="137.65" dur="6.23">seems like all they have is debt and</text>
  <text start="139.709" dur="8.011">there&amp;#39;s nothing else to show except</text>
  <text start="143.88" dur="6.31">unemployment except economic collapse</text>
  <text start="147.72" dur="6.97">except for people living on the streets</text>
  <text start="150.19" dur="7.23">and we&amp;#39;re seeing that there are still</text>
  <text start="154.69" dur="7.519">talks about ballons</text>
  <text start="157.42" dur="7.65">in Greece and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="162.209" dur="8.901">bondholders</text>
  <text start="165.07" dur="9.22">might be used for the balance but this</text>
  <text start="171.11" dur="5.52">will then trickle down to depositors who</text>
  <text start="174.29" dur="6.96">represent the vast bulk of unsecured</text>
  <text start="176.63" dur="6.69">Greek bank liabilities so they are still</text>
  <text start="181.25" dur="3.57">looking at balance because they see that</text>
  <text start="183.32" dur="4.88">these banks are completely insolvent</text>
  <text start="184.82" dur="6.92">they see they&amp;#39;re going to collapse and</text>
  <text start="188.2" dur="5.68">bloomberg is reporting that a</text>
  <text start="191.74" dur="4.78">recapitalisation of Greek banks will</text>
  <text start="193.88" dur="6.66">exclude all depositors from losses until</text>

  <text start="226.1" dur="7.89">if the bank stock declines and the value</text>
  <text start="231.08" dur="7.77">continually decreases guess what happens</text>
  <text start="233.99" dur="8.49">to their savings it decreases so what</text>
  <text start="238.85" dur="7.32">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is they are</text>
  <text start="242.48" dur="6.96">preparing and getting ready to do</text>
  <text start="246.17" dur="6.09">balance if needed this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="249.44" dur="4.74">happening right now and it looks like</text>
  <text start="252.26" dur="4.11">everything is fine they&amp;#39;re coming up</text>
  <text start="254.18" dur="4.02">with this agreement and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="256.37" dur="4.11">the EU Parliament they&amp;#39;re gonna vote on</text>
  <text start="258.2" dur="5.46">it again this is not set in stone just</text>
  <text start="260.48" dur="5.88">yet there&amp;#39;s still other votes that need</text>
  <text start="263.66" dur="5.12">to be taken so everything is not done</text>
  <text start="266.36" dur="4.98">they do not have the bailout right now</text>
  <text start="268.78" dur="5.38">the IMF is looking to write off some of</text>
  <text start="271.34" dur="4.8">this debt they realize if they go</text>
  <text start="274.16" dur="3.87">through with this Greece just collapses</text>
  <text start="276.14" dur="3.33">right here on right now and of course</text>
  <text start="278.03" dur="6.06">then everyone&amp;#39;s gonna look at the</text>
  <text start="279.47" dur="9.12">bankers and say you piled on debt and</text>
  <text start="284.09" dur="7.56">you let Greece collapse they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="288.59" dur="5.04">this to happen and this is why they want</text>
  <text start="291.65" dur="3.39">some of the debt written off because</text>
  <text start="293.63" dur="3.33">they want to keep them at that point</text>
  <text start="295.04" dur="3.8">where they can take their resources</text>
  <text start="296.96" dur="4.02">that&amp;#39;s their goal</text>
  <text start="298.84" dur="4.09">their goal is to get those resources</text>
  <text start="300.98" dur="3.87">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s worth something this</text>
  <text start="302.93" dur="5.25">dollar and Inc stuff that&amp;#39;s worth</text>
  <text start="304.85" dur="6.5">nothing here in the United States we are</text>

  <text start="348.08" dur="6.51">rapidly and it looks like they might go</text>
  <text start="351.68" dur="5.48">bankrupt I mean think about all the</text>
  <text start="354.59" dur="5.76">retailers that have closed up shop and</text>
  <text start="357.16" dur="6.16">there&amp;#39;s so many that are teetering on</text>

  <text start="365.51" dur="5.55">one was the worst I mean Black Friday</text>
  <text start="367.37" dur="7.68">Cyber Monday a complete disaster there</text>
  <text start="371.06" dur="6.39">are there were retailers closing stores</text>
  <text start="375.05" dur="4.19">during the busiest time of the year</text>
  <text start="377.45" dur="4.11">think about that for a second</text>
  <text start="379.24" dur="4.48">Aeropostale we&amp;#39;re gonna be closing about</text>
  <text start="381.56" dur="4.56">75 stores then they announces during the</text>
  <text start="383.72" dur="4.86">busiest time of the year now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="386.12" dur="5.46">coming up to this holiday season once</text>
  <text start="388.58" dur="5.52">again and we understand the unemployment</text>
  <text start="391.58" dur="4.71">is now down at 5.3 percent which means</text>
  <text start="394.1" dur="3.72">there&amp;#39;s a lot more people employed a lot</text>
  <text start="396.29" dur="3.33">of people a lot more people making money</text>
  <text start="397.82" dur="4.41">because this is what the government is</text>
  <text start="399.62" dur="6.15">telling us so what we should see is an</text>
  <text start="402.23" dur="5.58">expansion of retail an expansion of</text>
  <text start="405.77" dur="4.11">people going out and using their</text>
  <text start="407.81" dur="4.08">discretionary funds to buy up those</text>
  <text start="409.88" dur="5.4">goods do you really think we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="411.89" dur="6.27">see this because guess what going back</text>
  <text start="415.28" dur="5.78">to 2009 when the government told us the</text>
  <text start="418.16" dur="7.02">unemployment rate was what 10 11 % and</text>
  <text start="421.06" dur="6.79">it&amp;#39;s come down ever since then why has</text>
  <text start="425.18" dur="5.16">everything gotten worse think about that</text>
  <text start="427.85" dur="3.689">if more and more people right now as the</text>
  <text start="430.34" dur="1.68">government is telling us if you want to</text>
  <text start="431.539" dur="4.951">believe that</text>
  <text start="432.02" dur="8.75">is employed why are stores closing why</text>
  <text start="436.49" dur="8.94">is retail contracting it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="440.77" dur="8.32">the same goes with real estate and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="445.43" dur="5.85">seeing at this point the corporate media</text>
  <text start="449.09" dur="4.049">the US government the Fed they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="451.28" dur="6.479">whatever they possibly can to spin the</text>
  <text start="453.139" dur="7.381">story that real estate is recovering</text>
  <text start="457.759" dur="6.451">it&amp;#39;s in full recovery don&amp;#39;t worry about</text>
  <text start="460.52" dur="5.959">it look the other way and after three</text>
  <text start="464.21" dur="5.1">months of exploding building permits</text>
  <text start="466.479" dur="6.37">driven exclusively by the Northeast</text>
  <text start="469.31" dur="5.94">region and this was a result of the</text>
  <text start="472.849" dur="3.201">expiring property tax breaks in New York</text>
  <text start="475.25" dur="5.819">City</text>
  <text start="476.05" dur="7.049">guess what since those expired and no</text>
  <text start="481.069" dur="5.551">one&amp;#39;s getting the breaks anymore</text>
  <text start="483.099" dur="7.481">July permits plunge sixteen point three</text>
  <text start="486.62" dur="6.299">percent the lowest since March of 2008</text>
  <text start="490.58" dur="5.91">and when we look at this graph we see a</text>
  <text start="492.919" dur="7.411">huge spike up and a huge spike straight</text>
  <text start="496.49" dur="6.45">down this was also the biggest miss on</text>
  <text start="500.33" dur="5.28">record for permits housing starts rose</text>
  <text start="502.94" dur="5.64">less than expected but thanks to a</text>
  <text start="505.61" dur="6.419">dramatic upward reversion our stable at</text>
  <text start="508.58" dur="5.19">around 1.2 million units and this is</text>
  <text start="512.029" dur="3.51">what they always do they go back and</text>
  <text start="513.77" dur="3.99">then revise the numbers to make</text>
  <text start="515.539" dur="4.531">everything look better than they are but</text>
  <text start="517.76" dur="6.66">this is actually pitiful compared to</text>
  <text start="520.07" dur="8.36">what has been happening back before 2008</text>
  <text start="524.42" dur="6.96">I mean if we&amp;#39;re in this housing recovery</text>
  <text start="528.43" dur="5.2">people should be out there purchasing</text>
  <text start="531.38" dur="5.61">homes left and right with unemployment</text>
  <text start="533.63" dur="5.55">so low but we&amp;#39;re not seeing this we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="536.99" dur="3.63">not seeing this at all I mean actually</text>
  <text start="539.18" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;re seeing mortgage applications</text>
  <text start="540.62" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;ve fallen flat in August now this</text>
  <text start="542.81" dur="6.39">is the hot season for real estate the</text>
  <text start="545.99" dur="5.219">flowers are blooming people say I want</text>
  <text start="549.2" dur="4.259">to move into a nicer house the grass is</text>
  <text start="551.209" dur="4.651">green everyone&amp;#39;s in a good mood it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="553.459" dur="4.681">warm I want to get into that house</text>
  <text start="555.86" dur="3.84">before September before school starts</text>
  <text start="558.14" dur="4.71">this is when people go out and purchase</text>
  <text start="559.7" dur="5.97">homes spring and summer we are not</text>
  <text start="562.85" dur="8.04">seeing this mortgage applications are</text>
  <text start="565.67" dur="9.32">increase by 0.1% August is a flop right</text>
  <text start="570.89" dur="7.74">now and we&amp;#39;re in the middle of August</text>
  <text start="574.99" dur="8.01">when we go into fall winter it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="578.63" dur="6.84">to completely come tumbling down and</text>
  <text start="583" dur="4.96">we&amp;#39;ve seen this before we saw it last</text>
  <text start="585.47" dur="4.2">year happen but don&amp;#39;t worry the Fed is</text>
  <text start="587.96" dur="3.39">doing whatever they possibly can to keep</text>
  <text start="589.67" dur="4.02">this bubble alive because you have to</text>
  <text start="591.35" dur="4.53">remember it&amp;#39;s a central bank economy not</text>
  <text start="593.69" dur="3.81">a people&amp;#39;s economy and they will be</text>
  <text start="595.88" dur="3.45">giving that free money to hedge funds</text>
  <text start="597.5" dur="4.44">investment companies but again what</text>
  <text start="599.33" dur="4.92">happens is they can only do so much and</text>
  <text start="601.94" dur="5.88">we&amp;#39;re starting to see things really fall</text>
  <text start="604.25" dur="5.76">apart now the Atlanta Fed is continually</text>
  <text start="607.82" dur="3.81">making forecasts they originally</text>
  <text start="610.01" dur="5.19">forecasted that the GDP numbers would be</text>
  <text start="611.63" dur="6.32">around 0.7 they upped it to 1.3 because</text>
  <text start="615.2" dur="5.3">what happened was the auto industry</text>
  <text start="617.95" dur="5.26">decided we&amp;#39;re going to increase</text>
  <text start="620.5" dur="6.22">production we&amp;#39;re going to channel stuff</text>
  <text start="623.21" dur="6.93">the dealers and auto inventories right</text>
  <text start="626.72" dur="6">now which we discussed before are at</text>
  <text start="630.14" dur="5.55">all-time highs they&amp;#39;re at record highs</text>
  <text start="632.72" dur="4.68">and this is 61 straight months in a row</text>
  <text start="635.69" dur="3.51">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="637.4" dur="4.5">doing whatever they possibly can to get</text>
  <text start="639.2" dur="5.73">these GDP numbers up and it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="641.9" dur="4.86">matter how they do it because we know</text>
  <text start="644.93" dur="3.96">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="646.76" dur="2.91">this whole system is gonna come</text>
  <text start="648.89" dur="2.76">crumbling down</text>
  <text start="649.67" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s going to collapse we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="651.65" dur="4.71">the same thing that happened in Greece</text>
  <text start="653.57" dur="5.58">there&amp;#39;ll be a point when this system</text>
  <text start="656.36" dur="8.31">cannot take it anymore the banks will be</text>
  <text start="659.15" dur="8.21">shut down balance will happen I mean</text>
  <text start="664.67" dur="6.78">think about how this is going to occur I</text>
  <text start="667.36" dur="6.28">mean this could happen in any way</text>
  <text start="671.45" dur="5.42">possible I mean it could be a</text>
  <text start="673.64" dur="5.46">cyberattack it could be anything and</text>
  <text start="676.87" dur="4.75">basically what will happen is the FDIC</text>
  <text start="679.1" dur="4.65">will take over the bank the bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="681.62" dur="3.75">managers will be forced down the banks</text>
  <text start="683.75" dur="3.78">debts and liabilities are converted into</text>
  <text start="685.37" dur="4.59">equity or the bank stocks and yes your</text>
  <text start="687.53" dur="5.31">deposits are considered a liability for</text>
  <text start="689.96" dur="4.83">the bank whatever happens to the bank</text>
  <text start="692.84" dur="4.23">stocks affects your wealth of the stocks</text>
  <text start="694.79" dur="4.65">go down guess what you lose your money</text>
  <text start="697.07" dur="3.72">if the bank stocks fall</text>
  <text start="699.44" dur="2.97">at the point because everyone has</text>
  <text start="700.79" dur="5.01">figured out the bank is in major trouble</text>
  <text start="702.41" dur="5.16">your wealth Falls to now everyone thinks</text>
  <text start="705.8" dur="3.51">well they&amp;#39;re only gonna take those</text>
  <text start="707.57" dur="3.84">accounts that have two hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="709.31" dur="3.87">thousand dollars or more everyone under</text>
