  <text start="53.15" dur="4.75">we&amp;#39;re seeing in the market not really</text>
  <text start="55.559" dur="5.761">going to wear gold pretty much holding</text>
  <text start="57.9" dur="5.7">steady right now and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="61.32" dur="4.53">interesting is that the United States</text>
  <text start="63.6" dur="4.65">government central bankers they are</text>
  <text start="65.85" dur="6.03">going to push as hard as they possibly</text>

  <text start="75.45" dur="5.16">believe us and we can already see this</text>
  <text start="77.76" dur="5.31">happening but when we look through this</text>
  <text start="80.61" dur="6.36">we see that the economy is not doing</text>
  <text start="83.07" dur="6.99">well we see that the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="86.97" dur="5.16">much much worse and we see in many</text>
  <text start="90.06" dur="3.75">different areas especially in real</text>
  <text start="92.13" dur="5.61">estate when we talked about Vancouver in</text>
  <text start="93.81" dur="7.56">Canada talked about the UK we talked</text>
  <text start="97.74" dur="6.84">about Alberta Canada where single-family</text>
  <text start="101.37" dur="7.77">construction has fallen to the lowest</text>
  <text start="104.58" dur="9.36">level since 2009 and this is coming from</text>
  <text start="109.14" dur="7.25">the statistics of Canada and what does</text>
  <text start="113.94" dur="6.84">this tell us that this is spreading now</text>
  <text start="116.39" dur="8.23">to different countries and housing</text>
  <text start="120.78" dur="5.64">prices the sales of homes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="124.62" dur="4.32">starting to decline but here in the</text>
  <text start="126.42" dur="6.03">United States the US government central</text>
  <text start="128.94" dur="6.15">bankers they want everyone to believe up</text>
  <text start="132.45" dur="3.869">to the very last minute that everything</text>
  <text start="135.09" dur="4.8">is fine now they did this back in two</text>
  <text start="136.319" dur="6.571">thousand eight because everyone most</text>
  <text start="139.89" dur="7.069">likely remembers Bernanke coming out</text>
  <text start="142.89" dur="7.319">saying listen this subprime is contained</text>
  <text start="146.959" dur="6.011">real estate will not go down real estate</text>
  <text start="150.209" dur="6.631">doesn&amp;#39;t go down and he said this during</text>
  <text start="152.97" dur="5.91">the summer months of 2008 and of course</text>
  <text start="156.84" dur="6.12">he was trying to convince everyone that</text>
  <text start="158.88" dur="7.29">everything was fine well</text>
  <text start="162.96" dur="6.85">the US government central bankers and</text>
  <text start="166.17" dur="6.64">the various agencies they&amp;#39;re a little</text>
  <text start="169.81" dur="7.02">slicker now they&amp;#39;re able to manipulate a</text>
  <text start="172.81" dur="6.81">lot of the data and they&amp;#39;ve made sure</text>
  <text start="176.83" dur="6.92">that we are in this constant state of</text>
  <text start="179.62" dur="7.11">believing what they say now the census</text>
  <text start="183.75" dur="8.77">report came out that in July the u.s.</text>
  <text start="186.73" dur="8.43">saw a whopping su 654 thousand up 12.4</text>
  <text start="192.52" dur="4.95">percent from the prior month and higher</text>
  <text start="195.16" dur="6.54">by thirty-one percent from a year ago</text>
  <text start="197.47" dur="9.48">and they completely smashed smashed the</text>
  <text start="201.7" dur="7.17">expectations of hot 580,000 well this</text>
  <text start="206.95" dur="4.88">looks suspicious right off the bat and</text>
  <text start="208.87" dur="5.49">when we look at this we can see that</text>
  <text start="211.83" dur="4.24">there was really no change out in the</text>
  <text start="214.36" dur="6.39">West actually sales have fallen out in</text>
  <text start="216.07" dur="9.78">the west and the south right now posted</text>
  <text start="220.75" dur="8.54">a massive 18.1 percent jump in the month</text>
  <text start="225.85" dur="7.22">of july up forty percent a year ago and</text>
  <text start="229.29" dur="8.26">I remember back in 2007 going into 2008</text>
  <text start="233.07" dur="6.79">when I was visiting Miami area Fort</text>
  <text start="237.55" dur="6.09">Lauderdale area there were cranes all</text>
  <text start="239.86" dur="7.05">over the place building going on like</text>
  <text start="243.64" dur="7.5">crazy you just couldn&amp;#39;t believe it how</text>
  <text start="246.91" dur="8.16">much was happening all of it came to a</text>
  <text start="251.14" dur="8.15">screeching halt all that building were</text>
  <text start="255.07" dur="7.76">speculators buying up condos like crazy</text>
  <text start="259.29" dur="6.73">we are seeing the same thing right now</text>
  <text start="262.83" dur="7.08">free money flowing in foreign</text>
  <text start="266.02" dur="7.709">speculators in the market and</text>
  <text start="269.91" dur="8.47">manipulation on top of that we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="273.729" dur="8.611">a repeat of what we saw prior to the</text>
  <text start="278.38" dur="6.63">crash of 2008 but this time it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="282.34" dur="6.389">to be worse because this time this</text>
  <text start="285.01" dur="8.13">housing bubble people aren&amp;#39;t actually in</text>
  <text start="288.729" dur="6.571">it it is the central bank it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="293.14" dur="3.33">banking systems its hedge funds</text>
  <text start="295.3" dur="4.65">investment companies</text>
  <text start="296.47" dur="6.15">where they won out they took the free</text>
  <text start="299.95" dur="5.28">money and they purchased thousands upon</text>
  <text start="302.62" dur="7.71">thousands of homes and they were</text>
  <text start="305.23" dur="10.05">instructed to hold them do not sell them</text>
  <text start="310.33" dur="8.18">rent them if you can but do not sell</text>
  <text start="315.28" dur="6.63">them the banks were instructed not to</text>
  <text start="318.51" dur="5.56">foreclose on people&amp;#39;s homes do not let</text>
  <text start="321.91" dur="4.56">them back on the market keep them off</text>
  <text start="324.07" dur="8.04">the market because it will drive prices</text>
  <text start="326.47" dur="7.64">up and they&amp;#39;re still doing the same type</text>
  <text start="332.11" dur="5.1">of tricks while all this was happening</text>
  <text start="334.11" dur="5.19">the fed was buying up the toxic real</text>
  <text start="337.21" dur="7.05">estate and put it onto its books and</text>
  <text start="339.3" dur="7.99">that&amp;#39;s where it sits we see the richmond</text>
  <text start="344.26" dur="4.95">fed manufacturing survey well it is</text>
  <text start="347.29" dur="4.92">plunged to negative 11 this is the</text>
  <text start="349.21" dur="9.209">lowest since january of 2013 it has</text>
  <text start="352.21" dur="9.39">missed expectations of a positive six so</text>
  <text start="358.419" dur="8.071">we&amp;#39;ll be looking at here well this is</text>
  <text start="361.6" dur="11.46">the largest decline on record going back</text>
  <text start="366.49" dur="11.31">to 1993 and it looks like the bounce the</text>
  <text start="373.06" dur="6.6">dead cat bounce it&amp;#39;s over we see</text>
  <text start="377.8" dur="5.16">following the eurozone&amp;#39;s disappointing</text>
  <text start="379.66" dur="7.74">drift lower and manufacturing PMI and in</text>
  <text start="382.96" dur="7.68">weakness in the German services August</text>
  <text start="387.4" dur="5.82">us preliminary manufacturing PMI while</text>
  <text start="390.64" dur="5.7">that printed a disappointing 52.1 and</text>
  <text start="393.22" dur="7.49">they expected a 52.6 there&amp;#39;s weakness</text>
  <text start="396.34" dur="9.57">and employment new orders are declining</text>
  <text start="400.71" dur="8.92">hope is fading we are getting flashing</text>
  <text start="405.91" dur="7.819">warning lights that we are heading for a</text>
  <text start="409.63" dur="8.55">major collapse and when we look at every</text>
  <text start="413.729" dur="8.531">single sector it is pointing in the same</text>
  <text start="418.18" dur="7.59">direction so what are the central banks</text>
  <text start="422.26" dur="7.5">do well the Bank of Japan they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="425.77" dur="8.67">a move they&amp;#39;re going to double their</text>
  <text start="429.76" dur="7.23">TF purchases 26 trillion yen or fifty</text>
  <text start="434.44" dur="6.9">eight billion dollars up from three</text>
  <text start="436.99" dur="6.27">point three trillion yen which is</text>
  <text start="441.34" dur="3.74">equivalent to the Fed purchasing five</text>
  <text start="443.26" dur="7.08">hundred and five hundred eighty billion</text>
  <text start="445.08" dur="8.04">ETFs so when we look at this what is the</text>
  <text start="450.34" dur="6.9">Bank of Japan actually doing well your</text>
  <text start="453.12" dur="7.78">nationalizing the stock market and what</text>
  <text start="457.24" dur="7.98">does that mean it means there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="460.9" dur="7.74">be no free and open market it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="465.22" dur="6.06">be controlled is going to be price</text>
  <text start="468.64" dur="4.08">distortions and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="471.28" dur="5.51">continue to do this to grease the</text>
  <text start="472.72" dur="6.93">economy and when the market is</text>
  <text start="476.79" dur="5.62">completely driven by the central bank</text>
  <text start="479.65" dur="7.13">and not by company&amp;#39;s earnings and</text>
  <text start="482.41" dur="8.37">anything like that the entire market is</text>
  <text start="486.78" dur="7.51">completely fake and this is the only way</text>
  <text start="490.78" dur="7.53">they can keep the system alive we see in</text>
  <text start="494.29" dur="8.78">Europe the ECB is buying private</text>
  <text start="498.31" dur="7.65">placement debt with no regard for safety</text>
  <text start="503.07" dur="5.65">or anything like that so private</text>
  <text start="505.96" dur="9.06">companies they&amp;#39;re issuing debt because</text>
  <text start="508.72" dur="9.72">they know the ECB will purchase it why</text>
  <text start="515.02" dur="8.67">are they doing this because they need to</text>
  <text start="518.44" dur="11.91">keep the system alive this whole entire</text>
  <text start="523.69" dur="8.82">thing is crashing around us and remember</text>
  <text start="530.35" dur="5.43">QE is supposed to spur lending and</text>
  <text start="532.51" dur="9.18">investment but it&amp;#39;s killing pension</text>
  <text start="535.78" dur="7.92">plans and it&amp;#39;s fostering bond bubbles so</text>
  <text start="541.69" dur="6.15">what the central banks are doing right</text>
  <text start="543.7" dur="7.14">now it is hurting the economy for the</text>
  <text start="547.84" dur="4.95">everyday person who is it helping it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="550.84" dur="4.77">helping the corporation&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s helping</text>
  <text start="552.79" dur="5.67">the banks it&amp;#39;s helping the elite it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="555.61" dur="5.97">helping those people make more and more</text>
  <text start="558.46" dur="5.6">money as the system comes down but the</text>
  <text start="561.58" dur="2.48">everyday person</text>
  <text start="564.3" dur="10.449">they can barely make it through now we</text>
  <text start="569.529" dur="8.04">see that Treasury bonds well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="574.749" dur="6.301">being dumped and the other thing that</text>
  <text start="577.569" dur="7.05">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that foreign demand for</text>
  <text start="581.05" dur="6.839">US Treasury it&amp;#39;s dried up last week&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="584.619" dur="5.041">tick data confirmed something the Fed</text>
  <text start="587.889" dur="4.2">Treasury custody account has indicated</text>
  <text start="589.66" dur="4.83">for the past several months foreign</text>
  <text start="592.089" dur="5.28">demand for US government bonds has not</text>
  <text start="594.49" dur="7.129">only tumbled but there has been</text>
  <text start="597.369" dur="6.39">aggressive selling in the past 12 months</text>
  <text start="601.619" dur="5.89">foreign central banks have sold a</text>
  <text start="603.759" dur="7.32">gargantuan 335 billion in US Treasuries</text>
  <text start="607.509" dur="6.591">and 242 billion when looking at all</text>
  <text start="611.079" dur="8.31">foreign transactions including private</text>
  <text start="614.1" dur="7.779">it&amp;#39;s declining rapidly now why are they</text>
  <text start="619.389" dur="6.81">doing this because they&amp;#39;re getting out</text>
  <text start="621.879" dur="7.46">of us paper they don&amp;#39;t want to hold it</text>
  <text start="626.199" dur="5.461">when the system comes crumbling down</text>
  <text start="629.339" dur="4.24">countries are going to get out of the</text>
  <text start="631.66" dur="4.019">dollar out of the petro dollar because</text>
  <text start="633.579" dur="6.531">they don&amp;#39;t want to have this in reserves</text>
  <text start="635.679" dur="4.431">when the system comes crashing down</text>
  <text start="640.529" dur="8.021">other countries realize this and this is</text>
  <text start="643.87" dur="9.36">why we see a huge push to get out of all</text>
  <text start="648.55" dur="7.44">US paper and people say well really do</text>
  <text start="653.23" dur="5.579">you have any proof that the government</text>
  <text start="655.99" dur="5.329">is lying about employment government is</text>
  <text start="658.809" dur="6.12">lying about everything that we see here</text>
  <text start="661.319" dur="5.14">well all we have to do is go to the</text>
  <text start="664.929" dur="5.1">receipts from the federal unemployment</text>
  <text start="666.459" dur="6.57">tax act futa and when we look at them</text>
  <text start="670.029" dur="7.47">they&amp;#39;ve been falling steadily since 2012</text>
  <text start="673.029" dur="6.87">how could that be because when you think</text>
  <text start="677.499" dur="4.26">about it the government is continually</text>
  <text start="679.899" dur="3.72">telling us that we&amp;#39;re adding more and</text>
  <text start="681.759" dur="7.5">more jobs the unemployment rate is</text>
  <text start="683.619" dur="10.65">coming down but the federal unemployment</text>
  <text start="689.259" dur="6.601">tax act that has to be the receipts have</text>
  <text start="694.269" dur="4.951">been declining</text>
  <text start="695.86" dur="7.44">and when we look at this we can see that</text>
  <text start="699.22" dur="6.239">the futa tax is levied at six percent of</text>
  <text start="703.3" dur="6.45">the first seven thousand of an</text>
  <text start="705.459" dur="7.38">employee&amp;#39;s wage since 2012 unemployment</text>
  <text start="709.75" dur="6.63">tax receipts have been falling so if the</text>
  <text start="712.839" dur="7.611">US economy is creating jobs people are</text>
  <text start="716.38" dur="6.81">working now why is the number falling</text>
  <text start="720.45" dur="6.55">well it&amp;#39;s either the BLS numbers are</text>
  <text start="723.19" dur="7.26">completely wrong or the quality of new</text>
  <text start="727" dur="6.14">jobs created must be very poor and we</text>
  <text start="730.45" dur="5.75">can see it&amp;#39;s a combination of both</text>
  <text start="733.14" dur="6.069">people are losing the high-paying jobs</text>
  <text start="736.2" dur="5.74">they&amp;#39;re finding part-time work maybe one</text>
  <text start="739.209" dur="4.681">two three jobs to make up the difference</text>
  <text start="741.94" dur="4.019">from losing that high paying job and</text>
  <text start="743.89" dur="5.31">then we have the other end where people</text>
  <text start="745.959" dur="8.101">can&amp;#39;t find work at all and when we go</text>
  <text start="749.2" dur="7.68">right to the actual facts we can see</text>
  <text start="754.06" dur="4.89">that the government is lying when we go</text>
  <text start="756.88" dur="4.5">to the actual facts that foreign</text>
  <text start="758.95" dur="5.639">governments are dumping Treasuries we</text>
  <text start="761.38" dur="5.43">can see the government is lying when we</text>
  <text start="764.589" dur="4.62">go through all the economic indicators</text>
  <text start="766.81" dur="5.91">and we see that manufacturing is</text>
  <text start="769.209" dur="7.711">declining GDP is declining the housing</text>
  <text start="772.72" dur="6.84">market is declining prices are coming</text>
  <text start="776.92" dur="4.32">down we&amp;#39;re already seeing it in many</text>
  <text start="779.56" dur="4.019">many different countries it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="781.24" dur="4.74">happening at the same time but the</text>
  <text start="783.579" dur="4.171">corporate media nobody really wants to</text>
  <text start="785.98" dur="6.719">talk about it they just want to talk</text>
  <text start="787.75" dur="8.88">about how housing is surging in one</text>
  <text start="792.699" dur="7.471">little area through manipulation through</text>
  <text start="796.63" dur="6.149">free money to convince the entire</text>
  <text start="800.17" dur="4.62">country and the world that everything is</text>
  <text start="802.779" dur="5.701">fine they did this back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="804.79" dur="9.479">eight where they told everyone it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="808.48" dur="9.09">fine real estate doesn&amp;#39;t go down that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="814.269" dur="9.151">ridiculous talk but what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="817.57" dur="8.879">right now is that the entire system it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="823.42" dur="5.159">falling apart and as we get closer and</text>
  <text start="826.449" dur="3.211">closer to collapse this is one signal</text>
  <text start="828.579" dur="2.581">that you can look at here</text>
  <text start="829.66" dur="3.27">is that the u.s. government central</text>
  <text start="831.16" dur="5.31">bankers they are going to push a</text>
  <text start="832.93" dur="4.59">recovery so hard you&amp;#39;re not even going</text>
