  <text start="57.09" dur="4.98">when the cherry pour my name is Dave and</text>
  <text start="58.71" dur="7.199">this is episode 1295 BN today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="62.07" dur="6.659">June 1st 2017 and the title yep so it is</text>
  <text start="65.909" dur="6.271">the main agenda of the Bilderberg secret</text>
  <text start="68.729" dur="5.191">meeting is Trump let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="72.18" dur="4.979">economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="73.92" dur="6.42">geopolitical news now in past reports we</text>
  <text start="77.159" dur="6.511">talked about the Paris climate Accord we</text>
  <text start="80.34" dur="5.1">talked about Trump and how he was</text>
  <text start="83.67" dur="3.33">leaning towards withdrawing the United</text>
  <text start="85.44" dur="4.89">States from the Paris climate Accord</text>
  <text start="87" dur="4.77">well today he came out and he said that</text>
  <text start="90.33" dur="4.23">the United States is now withdrawing</text>
  <text start="91.77" dur="5.099">from the Paris climate Accord now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="94.56" dur="4.83">going to go over what happened here and</text>
  <text start="96.869" dur="4.351">what he was talking about and what the</text>
  <text start="99.39" dur="3.78">Paris climate Accord was really all</text>
  <text start="101.22" dur="3.66">about but first I want to start with</text>
  <text start="103.17" dur="4.83">European Commissioner President</text>
  <text start="104.88" dur="7.2">jean-claude Juncker where he said that</text>
  <text start="108" dur="6.149">Trump he doesn&amp;#39;t understand the aspects</text>
  <text start="112.08" dur="5.099">of the Paris agreement on climate change</text>
  <text start="114.149" dur="6.841">he says that it will take at least three</text>
  <text start="117.179" dur="7.561">years to remove the United States from</text>
  <text start="120.99" dur="5.61">the Paris climate agreement now this is</text>
  <text start="124.74" dur="3.87">true it&amp;#39;s got and we discussed this</text>
  <text start="126.6" dur="4.5">before it will take three years now I</text>
  <text start="128.61" dur="6.12">think this was done on purpose when this</text>
  <text start="131.1" dur="7.229">was created and if you abide by the deal</text>
  <text start="134.73" dur="6.03">it would take the next president or her</text>
  <text start="138.329" dur="4.44">whoever&amp;#39;s in office three years to</text>
  <text start="140.76" dur="3.569">remove the United States and I think</text>
  <text start="142.769" dur="4.53">they did this on purpose because they</text>
  <text start="144.329" dur="5.701">hoped that by the time they were almost</text>
  <text start="147.299" dur="4.591">done that may be a new president would</text>
  <text start="150.03" dur="4.23">come into office and they can stop the</text>
  <text start="151.89" dur="4.62">whole process because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="154.26" dur="4.229">countries to remove themselves from this</text>
  <text start="156.51" dur="3.449">because this has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="158.489" dur="3.451">climate now a lot of people going to be</text>
  <text start="159.959" dur="4.261">out there saying well yes it does we</text>
  <text start="161.94" dur="4.71">want to keep the earth you know green we</text>
  <text start="164.22" dur="6.84">we have to reduce our carbon footprint</text>
  <text start="166.65" dur="8.13">know these are bankers bankers don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="171.06" dur="6.06">care about the climate they&amp;#39;re not doing</text>
  <text start="174.78" dur="5.34">it for the benefit of you they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="177.12" dur="7.589">doing it to help the people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="180.12" dur="6.869">doing it to help themselves because we</text>
  <text start="184.709" dur="4.471">know the climate is always changing</text>
  <text start="186.989" dur="5.761">climates have always changed throughout</text>
  <text start="189.18" dur="5.94">history and we can see that it&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="192.75" dur="4.89">actual people who are changing the</text>
  <text start="195.12" dur="6.06">climate because it&amp;#39;s always happened is</text>
  <text start="197.64" dur="5.969">there any evidence human activity is</text>
  <text start="201.18" dur="5.399">substantially contributing to the</text>
  <text start="203.609" dur="6.511">detrimental climate change that we can</text>
  <text start="206.579" dur="5.851">reproduce over and over and over where</text>
  <text start="210.12" dur="4.41">it&amp;#39;s open and free and any scientist can</text>
  <text start="212.43" dur="5.22">get to it and reproduce their</text>
  <text start="214.53" dur="5.01">experiments no they don&amp;#39;t want people</text>
  <text start="217.65" dur="6.119">reproducing what they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="219.54" dur="7.919">because it&amp;#39;s a hoax so what we are</text>
  <text start="223.769" dur="6.241">seeing right now is this climate this</text>
  <text start="227.459" dur="6.51">Paris climate Accord has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="230.01" dur="7.97">with climate so what is this all about</text>
  <text start="233.969" dur="8.63">why are multinational corporations</text>
  <text start="237.98" dur="9.25">governments bankers why are they all</text>
  <text start="242.599" dur="7.181">telling us that we need to do these</text>
  <text start="247.23" dur="6.509">things why are they pushing this hoax</text>
  <text start="249.78" dur="5.94">why are they pushing global fraud well</text>
  <text start="253.739" dur="4.411">the answer is very simple powerful</text>
  <text start="255.72" dur="4.859">people in the world who want to retain</text>
  <text start="258.15" dur="5.57">and maximize their wealth and authority</text>
  <text start="260.579" dur="6.84">they do it by lying deceiving and</text>
  <text start="263.72" dur="5.55">misleading the climate change mantra has</text>
  <text start="267.419" dur="5.191">always been about promoting two things</text>
  <text start="269.27" dur="5.41">global governance unaccountable to the</text>
  <text start="272.61" dur="4.529">people and the rule of law and</text>
  <text start="274.68" dur="5.51">redistribution of wealth on massive</text>
  <text start="277.139" dur="6.27">international scale the evidence is</text>
  <text start="280.19" dur="5.5">incontrovertible key leaders of this</text>
  <text start="283.409" dur="5.911">Freud have admitted as much in their own</text>
  <text start="285.69" dur="5.19">words in 2010 Ottmar and in Hoffer and</text>
  <text start="289.32" dur="3.599">official the United Nations</text>
  <text start="290.88" dur="4.77">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate</text>
  <text start="292.919" dur="5.301">Change told German news outlet first of</text>
  <text start="295.65" dur="4.65">all developed countries have basically</text>
  <text start="298.22" dur="4.81">expropriated the atmosphere of the world</text>
  <text start="300.3" dur="4.859">community but one must say clearly that</text>
  <text start="303.03" dur="4.71">we redistribute de facto the world</text>
  <text start="305.159" dur="5.371">wealth by climate policy what they were</text>
  <text start="307.74" dur="5.79">doing with all of this was they were</text>
  <text start="310.53" dur="6.359">going to use this to redistribute wealth</text>
  <text start="313.53" dur="5.85">and have the people pay down the debt</text>
  <text start="316.889" dur="3.871">that was one part of the agenda the</text>
  <text start="319.38" dur="4.44">other part of the agenda</text>
  <text start="320.76" dur="8.04">was to bring all the countries in line</text>
  <text start="323.82" dur="7.89">to a certain world status and this is</text>
  <text start="328.8" dur="5.19">why the deal for the United States was</text>
  <text start="331.71" dur="6.51">not that great now Trump pointed this</text>
  <text start="333.99" dur="6.9">out during his speech he said we will</text>
  <text start="338.22" dur="5.37">cease honoring all nine non-binding</text>
  <text start="340.89" dur="5.19">agreements and will stop contributing to</text>
  <text start="343.59" dur="4.08">the Green Climate Fund because this was</text>
  <text start="346.08" dur="3.69">taken billions and billions of dollars</text>
  <text start="347.67" dur="4.41">and putting it into this Green Climate</text>
  <text start="349.77" dur="4.08">Fund from the United States he said I</text>
  <text start="352.08" dur="4.56">cannot in good conscience support a deal</text>
  <text start="353.85" dur="5.58">that harms United States the bottom line</text>
  <text start="356.64" dur="4.02">is that the Paris Accord is very unfair</text>
  <text start="359.43" dur="3.39">to the United States now think about</text>
  <text start="360.66" dur="5.01">this why would it be unfair to the</text>
  <text start="362.82" dur="5.31">United States he said this agreement is</text>
  <text start="365.67" dur="4.98">less about climate and more about other</text>
  <text start="368.13" dur="5.97">countries getting a financial advantage</text>
  <text start="370.65" dur="6.75">over the United States think about what</text>
  <text start="374.1" dur="6.18">he&amp;#39;s saying right now why would that be</text>
  <text start="377.4" dur="4.35">now we talked about this before because</text>
  <text start="380.28" dur="5.73">they needed to bring the United States</text>
  <text start="381.75" dur="6.3">down to a certain level while the</text>
  <text start="386.01" dur="4.59">emerging markets they needed to bring</text>
  <text start="388.05" dur="5.37">them up this is why they were very lacks</text>
  <text start="390.6" dur="5.31">on these countries he said the agreement</text>
  <text start="393.42" dur="5.97">is a massive redistribution of United</text>
  <text start="395.91" dur="5.91">States wealth to other countries now</text>
  <text start="399.39" dur="4.92">remember this Paris climate deal was</text>
  <text start="401.82" dur="5.67">supposed to work with the TPP the TTIP</text>
  <text start="404.31" dur="6.47">and there were supposed to work in</text>
  <text start="407.49" dur="7.14">concert now what he&amp;#39;s saying is that by</text>
  <text start="410.78" dur="6.91">2040 our economy would lose about 6.5</text>
  <text start="414.63" dur="6.33">million industrial sector jobs including</text>
  <text start="417.69" dur="6.24">3.1 million manufacturing sector jobs</text>
  <text start="420.96" dur="6.03">all these jobs would be going over see</text>
  <text start="423.93" dur="6">to third world nations the United States</text>
  <text start="426.99" dur="6.96">would have to be brought down to that</text>
  <text start="429.93" dur="6.21">level and once all that was done those</text>
  <text start="433.95" dur="5.04">jobs would be coming back to the United</text>
  <text start="436.14" dur="6.21">States but the pay rate would be at a</text>
  <text start="438.99" dur="5.31">third-world status this is what they</text>
  <text start="442.35" dur="5.04">were trying to do because they were</text>
  <text start="444.3" dur="6.12">setting up the world to be a one world</text>
  <text start="447.39" dur="6.57">government and they needed to have the</text>
  <text start="450.42" dur="3.989">TPP the TTIP and the Paris climate a</text>
  <text start="453.96" dur="2.779">core</text>
  <text start="454.409" dur="4.38">they needed all of this to work together</text>
  <text start="456.739" dur="4.9">he went on to say that the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="458.789" dur="4.38">already a clean energy and oil and gas</text>
  <text start="461.639" dur="3.3">energy leader we can reduce our</text>
  <text start="463.169" dur="3.96">emissions and continue to produce</text>
  <text start="464.939" dur="5.22">American energy without the Paris Accord</text>
  <text start="467.129" dur="6.09">because this really had nothing to do</text>
  <text start="470.159" dur="6.09">with climate as he states that the whole</text>
  <text start="473.219" dur="5.91">deal had to do with business how to do</text>
  <text start="476.249" dur="4.74">with corporations how to do with taking</text>
  <text start="479.129" dur="3.96">the wealth from the United States and</text>
  <text start="480.989" dur="4.5">moving it someplace else</text>
  <text start="483.089" dur="5.07">taking manufacturing and moving it</text>
  <text start="485.489" dur="4.5">someplace else now he also brought up</text>
  <text start="488.159" dur="3.06">that well we&amp;#39;re gonna look at the Paris</text>
  <text start="489.989" dur="5.22">climate Accord and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="491.219" dur="5.79">renegotiate bits and pieces of it and</text>
  <text start="495.209" dur="4.32">I&amp;#39;m going to tell you right now most</text>
  <text start="497.009" dur="5.101">likely this is a non-starter it will not</text>
  <text start="499.529" dur="5.73">go anywhere because in the globalist</text>
  <text start="502.11" dur="5.699">plan they need things to be a certain</text>
  <text start="505.259" dur="4.11">way and for things to be beneficial to</text>
  <text start="507.809" dur="3.42">the United States this is not part of</text>
  <text start="509.369" dur="6.001">their plan because they need all the</text>
  <text start="511.229" dur="5.97">countries at a certain level and to make</text>
  <text start="515.37" dur="4.74">it beneficial for the United States it</text>
  <text start="517.199" dur="5.551">will not be a level playing field so he</text>
  <text start="520.11" dur="5.399">already knows that this is gonna this</text>
  <text start="522.75" dur="6.48">will not go anywhere but again he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="525.509" dur="6.301">playing the game he has to play the game</text>
  <text start="529.23" dur="5.13">and this is what he&amp;#39;s doing to make them</text>
  <text start="531.81" dur="4.8">think like ok he&amp;#39;s going to come back</text>
  <text start="534.36" dur="6.719">and we&amp;#39;ll make some deals just like with</text>
  <text start="536.61" dur="7.43">NAFTA most likely in the end remember it</text>
  <text start="541.079" dur="7.081">was developed to work for the globalist</text>
  <text start="544.04" dur="6.64">anything else it doesn&amp;#39;t work making it</text>
  <text start="548.16" dur="4.44">better for the u.s. it doesn&amp;#39;t help the</text>
  <text start="550.68" dur="5.49">globalists because they need to bring</text>
  <text start="552.6" dur="7.109">the u.s. down to a certain level if they</text>
  <text start="556.17" dur="5.69">can&amp;#39;t do it why have an agreement look</text>
  <text start="559.709" dur="4.38">at the brexit right now for an example</text>
  <text start="561.86" dur="5.949">ok they&amp;#39;re trying to have a negotiation</text>
  <text start="564.089" dur="5.43">and the EU is saying okay this is what</text>
  <text start="567.809" dur="4.171">we want we want billions of dollars we</text>
  <text start="569.519" dur="5.25">want this this this and this and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="571.98" dur="5.459">it because it doesn&amp;#39;t fit into their</text>
  <text start="574.769" dur="4.591">model remember they deal in absolute</text>
  <text start="577.439" dur="4.5">they don&amp;#39;t bargain there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="579.36" dur="5.61">negotiation and you can see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="581.939" dur="5.041">already telling the UK that listen this</text>
  <text start="584.97" dur="2.86">is what we want we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="586.98" dur="3.85">negotiate and</text>
  <text start="587.83" dur="5.52">these terms either do it or don&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="590.83" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s the same thing with the Paris</text>
  <text start="593.35" dur="3.96">climate Accord it&amp;#39;s the same thing with</text>
  <text start="595.21" dur="4.59">NAFTA it&amp;#39;s the same thing with all of</text>
  <text start="597.31" dur="6.36">these things because they have a certain</text>
  <text start="599.8" dur="5.85">model if they don&amp;#39;t follow it they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="603.67" dur="4.35">take over the world that&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="605.65" dur="4.86">what they&amp;#39;re doing they want a one world</text>
  <text start="608.02" dur="5.7">government one world currency and they</text>
  <text start="610.51" dur="5.1">want everyone on the same level where</text>
  <text start="613.72" dur="3.51">everyone is reporting up to them and</text>
  <text start="615.61" dur="4.68">there is no governments where the people</text>
  <text start="617.23" dur="8.06">elect governments they will be sitting</text>
  <text start="620.29" dur="8.52">at the top that is their main objective</text>
  <text start="625.29" dur="5.77">now we can see everything started with</text>
  <text start="628.81" dur="5.55">Trump getting elected the Russian</text>
  <text start="631.06" dur="6.42">collusion the Russian hacking a firing</text>
  <text start="634.36" dur="5.91">of James Comey and we can see it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="637.48" dur="4.95">coming to a head right now James Comey</text>
  <text start="640.27" dur="5.01">the former FBI director he&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="642.43" dur="5.13">testifying on June 8th starting at 10:00</text>
  <text start="645.28" dur="3.69">a.m. this should be very interesting we</text>
  <text start="647.56" dur="4.23">don&amp;#39;t know exactly what he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="648.97" dur="5.85">say but we&amp;#39;ll have to watch and see we</text>
  <text start="651.79" dur="5.28">see that Craig Gowdy he looks like he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="654.82" dur="4.98">poised to become the chair of the</text>
  <text start="657.07" dur="5.07">oversight with Russia probe because we</text>
  <text start="659.8" dur="6.66">understand that jason Chaffetz he&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="662.14" dur="6.51">leaving the oversight chair and he&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="666.46" dur="5.67">handing this over most likely to Gowdy</text>
  <text start="668.65" dur="5.84">come June 30th so this should be very</text>
  <text start="672.13" dur="4.71">interesting now we can see their</text>

  <text start="719.53" dur="4.02">unmasked</text>
  <text start="720.67" dur="5.07">now this is very interesting because</text>
  <text start="723.55" dur="4.26">this is the real important issue this is</text>
  <text start="725.74" dur="4.86">actually where a crime has been</text>
  <text start="727.81" dur="5.64">committed and there&amp;#39;s evidence where the</text>
  <text start="730.6" dur="6.36">FBI all the intelligence they all look</text>
  <text start="733.45" dur="6.42">the other way now these individuals are</text>
  <text start="736.96" dur="4.56">being subpoenaed and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="739.87" dur="4.98">try to get to the heart of the matter</text>
  <text start="741.52" dur="5.1">now will they get anywhere who knows but</text>
  <text start="744.85" dur="3.27">we can see that we&amp;#39;re heading in this</text>
  <text start="746.62" dur="4.17">direction now Trump was out there saying</text>
  <text start="748.12" dur="5.37">that yes this is what we need to do it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="750.79" dur="7.71">the leakers it&amp;#39;s the people who unmask</text>
  <text start="753.49" dur="6.96">that&amp;#39;s where the real issue lies now we</text>
  <text start="758.5" dur="3.99">can see there&amp;#39;s going to be a problem</text>
  <text start="760.45" dur="4.44">with the Russian hacking because that</text>
  <text start="762.49" dur="4.23">story is falling apart the Russian</text>
  <text start="764.89" dur="3.39">collusion story is falling apart and</text>
  <text start="766.72" dur="3.9">remember all over the corporate media</text>
  <text start="768.28" dur="5.43">when they said well the Russians were</text>
  <text start="770.62" dur="5.7">hacking into Mac Ron&amp;#39;s campaign and</text>
  <text start="773.71" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re the ones who did it well it</text>
  <text start="776.32" dur="5.13">looks like we have a problem actually</text>
  <text start="778.81" dur="6.39">not we it looks like the deep state has</text>
  <text start="781.45" dur="6.15">a problem because right now France has</text>
  <text start="785.2" dur="5.03">just confirmed that there are no traces</text>
  <text start="787.6" dur="6.63">of Russian hackers in the McCrone</text>
  <text start="790.23" dur="6.43">campaign now they looked at it and they</text>
  <text start="794.23" dur="5.54">said the hacking was so generic and</text>
  <text start="796.66" dur="6.87">simple that it could have been anybody</text>
  <text start="799.77" dur="6.61">they have no clue of course they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="803.53" dur="7.62">have a clue do you know how hard it is</text>
  <text start="806.38" dur="7.1">to find the hacker because they bounced</text>
  <text start="811.15" dur="5.67">whatever they&amp;#39;re doing offer multiple</text>
  <text start="813.48" dur="4.39">servers whatever code they&amp;#39;re using to</text>
  <text start="816.82" dur="3.38">get into the system</text>
  <text start="817.87" dur="6.06">there&amp;#39;s no breadcrumbs there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="820.2" dur="6.19">footprints inside of these pieces of</text>
  <text start="823.93" dur="4.62">malware or whatever they&amp;#39;re using they</text>
  <text start="826.39" dur="4.68">understand they need to cover their</text>
  <text start="828.55" dur="4.53">tracks and they do it very very well</text>
  <text start="831.07" dur="4.53">especially if it was a state actor like</text>
  <text start="833.08" dur="5.82">Russia they would cover their tracks</text>
  <text start="835.6" dur="5.43">and they would never find out so right</text>
  <text start="838.9" dur="3.51">from there which they&amp;#39;re the corporate</text>
  <text start="841.03" dur="3.08">media was out there saying they were</text>
  <text start="842.41" dur="4.05">absolutely positive that it was Russia</text>
  <text start="844.11" dur="5.08">well that whole thing just fell apart</text>
  <text start="846.46" dur="5.37">once again the same thing here in the</text>
  <text start="849.19" dur="4.92">United States the DNC will not let</text>
  <text start="851.83" dur="4.56">anyone look at their servers</text>
  <text start="854.11" dur="3.659">private company looked at it and said</text>
  <text start="856.39" dur="3.84">yeah we think it&amp;#39;s Russia now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="857.769" dur="4.531">actually backing off the whole entire</text>
  <text start="860.23" dur="4.2">thing is falling apart but the deep</text>
  <text start="862.3" dur="5.039">states not going to give up we can see</text>
  <text start="864.43" dur="6.029">there were many things happening across</text>
  <text start="867.339" dur="4.951">the world now we know that there are</text>
  <text start="870.459" dur="3.87">certain individuals within the Trump</text>
  <text start="872.29" dur="4.59">administration within the executive</text>
  <text start="874.329" dur="5.611">branch the Pentagon where they want to</text>
  <text start="876.88" dur="4.74">bring in a lot of forces into certain</text>

  <text start="881.62" dur="5.43">about not 5,000 troops 50,000 troops</text>
  <text start="884.23" dur="5.9">into Afghanistan and now it just so</text>
  <text start="887.05" dur="6.63">happens that we had this bomb go off in</text>
  <text start="890.13" dur="7.66">Afghanistan in Kabul in the embassy in</text>
  <text start="893.68" dur="5.79">uh in Kabul embassy district now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="897.79" dur="3.93">very interesting because Trump is going</text>
  <text start="899.47" dur="3.63">to be making the decision of should we</text>
  <text start="901.72" dur="3.09">bring troops and there shouldn&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="903.1" dur="4.91">bring troops in there and we just so</text>
  <text start="904.81" dur="6.899">happen to have a bomb that went off in</text>

  <text start="911.709" dur="4.741">Duterte is fighting the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="914.32" dur="4.05">and we know the CIA and the intelligence</text>

  <text start="938.529" dur="7.74">guess and we can see right now that this</text>
  <text start="941.47" dur="7.53">is all part of the plan one have bombs</text>
  <text start="946.269" dur="4.291">go off in Afghanistan while a decision</text>

  <text start="968.019" dur="5.041">what the deep state does and this is</text>
  <text start="970.54" dur="5.13">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now now Russia</text>
  <text start="973.06" dur="5.25">actually Putin is out there saying that</text>
  <text start="975.67" dur="4.62">listen this dad missile system and the</text>
  <text start="978.31" dur="3.96">additional sad missile systems that were</text>
  <text start="980.29" dur="5.58">found in South Korea that were hidden</text>
  <text start="982.27" dur="4.83">from the newly elected President Putin</text>
  <text start="985.87" dur="2.07">is out there saying this has nothing to</text>
  <text start="987.1" dur="3.3">do with North Korea</text>
  <text start="987.94" dur="3.72">because he says once we make a deal</text>
  <text start="990.4" dur="1.71">which is very interesting in what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="991.66" dur="3.42">saying</text>
  <text start="992.11" dur="5.97">once North Korea decides okay we will</text>
  <text start="995.08" dur="5.52">not pursue nuclear weapons if the United</text>
  <text start="998.08" dur="4.74">States decides okay we will stop the</text>
  <text start="1000.6" dur="5.31">drills will stop the provocations and we</text>
  <text start="1002.82" dur="5.55">come to this deal the THAAD system will</text>
  <text start="1005.91" dur="5.91">not be removed because it is put into</text>
  <text start="1008.37" dur="6.48">place for another reason it&amp;#39;s put in a</text>
  <text start="1011.82" dur="6.36">place for Russia and China just like the</text>
  <text start="1014.85" dur="6.36">missile shield that was supposed to be</text>
  <text start="1018.18" dur="4.89">in place for Iran and once the p5 plus</text>
  <text start="1021.21" dur="3.42">one deal was put into place and they</text>
  <text start="1023.07" dur="4.02">weren&amp;#39;t developing any type of nuclear</text>
  <text start="1024.63" dur="5.13">weapon Putin always said well why don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1027.09" dur="4.74">you take that down and of course it</text>
  <text start="1029.76" dur="5.16">never was because it was really put in</text>
  <text start="1031.83" dur="5.1">place for Russia the same thing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1034.92" dur="3.84">saying with the THAAD system in South</text>
  <text start="1036.93" dur="3.57">Korea it really had nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="1038.76" dur="3.39">North Korea but what I find very</text>
  <text start="1040.5" dur="4.38">interesting about this is that he said</text>
  <text start="1042.15" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s not about North Korea if tomorrow</text>
  <text start="1044.88" dur="3.63">North Korea declares it is stopping</text>
  <text start="1046.41" dur="4.17">nuclear tests and canceling its rocket</text>
  <text start="1048.51" dur="5.13">program the US will continue building</text>
  <text start="1050.58" dur="5.91">the ABM system under some new pretext or</text>
  <text start="1053.64" dur="5.7">without one at all and he&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="1056.49" dur="5.79">right this really has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="1059.34" dur="5.97">North Korea now we can see that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1062.28" dur="5.43">they are provoking North Korea they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1065.31" dur="4.2">having another military drill with the</text>
  <text start="1067.71" dur="5.07">USS Carl Vinson the USS Ronald Reagan</text>
  <text start="1069.51" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re having this joint drill with</text>
  <text start="1072.78" dur="4.8">Japanese destroyers and they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="1075.51" dur="5.13">this exercise right there because again</text>
  <text start="1077.58" dur="6.18">it&amp;#39;s about provoking Kim jong-un</text>
  <text start="1080.64" dur="6.06">now we know the South Korean president</text>
  <text start="1083.76" dur="5.67">we know China we know Russia trying to</text>
  <text start="1086.7" dur="6.09">create this diplomatic peace deal</text>
  <text start="1089.43" dur="5.37">between the u.s. North Korea and the</text>
  <text start="1092.79" dur="4.95">rest of the nations but the deep state</text>
  <text start="1094.8" dur="5.46">they don&amp;#39;t want this to happen this is</text>
  <text start="1097.74" dur="5.04">not part of their plan and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1100.26" dur="4.38">to continually push forward with the</text>
  <text start="1102.78" dur="6.09">provocations until they get their way</text>
  <text start="1104.64" dur="5.85">now of course China Russia Trump they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1108.87" dur="4.34">working on a completely different angle</text>
  <text start="1110.49" dur="7.16">at this time to calm the situation down</text>
  <text start="1113.21" dur="7.87">we see that Russia they are hitting the</text>
  <text start="1117.65" dur="4.54">militants as they flee Raqqa they are</text>
  <text start="1121.08" dur="3.36">hitting them</text>
  <text start="1122.19" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re bombing them and we can see</text>
  <text start="1124.44" dur="3.93">right now that there are more and more</text>
  <text start="1126.51" dur="4.08">towns there more and more villages</text>
  <text start="1128.37" dur="4.59">cities there that are being liberated</text>
  <text start="1130.59" dur="5.07">and the Islamic state they are on the</text>
  <text start="1132.96" dur="4.59">run right now now Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="1135.66" dur="6.3">something very interesting we know right</text>
  <text start="1137.55" dur="7.85">after Obama accused Russia of cyber</text>
  <text start="1141.96" dur="6.63">attacking the DNC fixing the elections</text>
  <text start="1145.4" dur="4.9">Obama decided listen would it be closing</text>
  <text start="1148.59" dur="3.3">down the two Russian compounds in</text>
  <text start="1150.3" dur="3.93">question which were located in New York</text>
  <text start="1151.89" dur="5.49">and Maryland and now Trump is saying</text>
  <text start="1154.23" dur="6.27">well it looks like we might be reopening</text>
  <text start="1157.38" dur="6.9">these and letting the Russians back in</text>
  <text start="1160.5" dur="5.55">and of course Trump he knows it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1164.28" dur="4.32">the Russians he knows this was all</text>
  <text start="1166.05" dur="5.19">completely fake phony and false and it</text>
  <text start="1168.6" dur="5.73">looks like he&amp;#39;s doing this as some type</text>
  <text start="1171.24" dur="5.31">of goodwill gesture towards the Russians</text>
  <text start="1174.33" dur="5.25">and of course during that period of time</text>
  <text start="1176.55" dur="5.04">Obama well he expelled 35 Russian</text>
  <text start="1179.58" dur="3.78">diplomats sanction for Russian</text>
  <text start="1181.59" dur="4.38">intelligence officer officials and</text>
  <text start="1183.36" dur="5.84">sanctioned three companies without any</text>
  <text start="1185.97" dur="6.63">proof whatsoever and this was done as</text>
  <text start="1189.2" dur="6.28">the transition was happening when Obama</text>
  <text start="1192.6" dur="6.15">was leaving and Trump was coming in now</text>
  <text start="1195.48" dur="6.06">Trump is actually removing everything</text>
  <text start="1198.75" dur="4.89">that Obama has done well almost</text>
  <text start="1201.54" dur="4.11">everything he&amp;#39;s allowing the diplomats</text>
  <text start="1203.64" dur="3.81">to come back in he&amp;#39;s trying to open</text>
  <text start="1205.65" dur="3.18">these compounds back up and I think</text>
  <text start="1207.45" dur="4.26">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="1208.83" dur="4.56">he&amp;#39;s going to remove the sanctions from</text>
  <text start="1211.71" dur="5.28">Russia but that will take a little bit</text>
  <text start="1213.39" dur="5.91">more time we see that NATO well they</text>
  <text start="1216.99" dur="5.34">decided that they will trigger Article</text>
  <text start="1219.3" dur="6.39">five if there is a prolonged cyber</text>
  <text start="1222.33" dur="5.73">attack against a country once they find</text>
  <text start="1225.69" dur="4.5">out who it is all the countries will</text>
  <text start="1228.06" dur="4.02">join in and attack that country that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1230.19" dur="3.42">really what this means and it looks like</text>
  <text start="1232.08" dur="6.87">they&amp;#39;re still getting prepared and ready</text>
  <text start="1233.61" dur="6.75">for some type of war now every year the</text>
