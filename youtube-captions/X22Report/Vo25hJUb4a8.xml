  <text start="249.45" dur="3.77">close to his chest to make sure that no</text>
  <text start="251.549" dur="3.541">one understands what he&amp;#39;s about to do</text>

  <text start="259.56" dur="4.65">that Trump and the Patriots they are now</text>
  <text start="261.9" dur="4.86">controlling the central bank here in the</text>
  <text start="264.21" dur="4.92">United States the Fed they&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="266.76" dur="4.83">started stimulus they&amp;#39;re pumping</text>
  <text start="269.13" dur="8.16">billions of dollars into the banking</text>
  <text start="271.59" dur="8.43">system why because without the Fed doing</text>
  <text start="277.29" dur="5.4">this without the Fed cutting rates the</text>
  <text start="280.02" dur="6.69">entire system would crash if the entire</text>
  <text start="282.69" dur="6.09">system crashes guess what we can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="286.71" dur="5.01">rid of the central bank because Trump</text>
  <text start="288.78" dur="5.04">once the economy deteriorates will not</text>
  <text start="291.72" dur="4.41">get reelected people are going to see</text>
  <text start="293.82" dur="4.77">this and say I lost my job I lost my</text>
  <text start="296.13" dur="6.03">investments I lost everything in this</text>
  <text start="298.59" dur="6.3">market I lost my savings why would I</text>
  <text start="302.16" dur="4.29">elect this individual this is why Trump</text>
  <text start="304.89" dur="4.59">and the Patriots needed to take control</text>
  <text start="306.45" dur="7.08">and that&amp;#39;s exactly what they did now</text>
  <text start="309.48" dur="7.08">already the Fed has pumped in around 400</text>
  <text start="313.53" dur="7.38">billion and this is about a hundred</text>
  <text start="316.56" dur="8.13">billion a day think about what Trump is</text>
  <text start="320.91" dur="7.71">doing right now he is driving the</text>
  <text start="324.69" dur="7.56">central bank to the edge of the cliff</text>
  <text start="328.62" dur="6.63">and why is he doing this remember they</text>
  <text start="332.25" dur="5.34">have multiple agendas here it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="335.25" dur="4.35">about cutting rates it&amp;#39;s not just about</text>
  <text start="337.59" dur="5.37">starting stimulus so he can get</text>
  <text start="339.6" dur="6.06">reelected in 2020 he needs the global</text>
  <text start="342.96" dur="5.4">system and really the Fed is controlling</text>
  <text start="345.66" dur="5.58">the global system right now he needs to</text>
  <text start="348.36" dur="6.9">bring the global system to its knees and</text>
  <text start="351.24" dur="8.76">they need to turn it all around and say</text>
  <text start="355.26" dur="7.26">this was or this is the problem they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="360" dur="5.79">going to create a crisis like we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="362.52" dur="5.13">never seen before and this time it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="365.79" dur="2.73">going to be let&amp;#39;s bail out all the</text>
  <text start="367.65" dur="3.3">corporations</text>
  <text start="368.52" dur="5.88">oh let&amp;#39;s bail out the elite and the</text>
  <text start="370.95" dur="5.85">establishment oh let&amp;#39;s give funds over</text>
  <text start="374.4" dur="5.01">to whoever whatever banking system</text>
  <text start="376.8" dur="5.22">across the world this is about saying no</text>
  <text start="379.41" dur="6.81">this ends here we&amp;#39;ve done this already</text>
  <text start="382.02" dur="7.68">in 2008 maybe we should find out why</text>
  <text start="386.22" dur="6.9">this keeps on happening was anything</text>
  <text start="389.7" dur="4.92">solved back in 2008 and that was what 11</text>
  <text start="393.12" dur="5.34">years ago we&amp;#39;re going on 12 years now</text>
  <text start="394.62" dur="7.41">and they&amp;#39;re going to push an audit they</text>
  <text start="398.46" dur="5.99">need a crisis to do this and that audit</text>
  <text start="402.03" dur="5.01">bill that just sitting in the house</text>
  <text start="404.45" dur="6.37">that&amp;#39;s gonna move and it&amp;#39;s gonna move</text>
  <text start="407.04" dur="7.86">pretty darn quickly because everyone is</text>
  <text start="410.82" dur="6.87">going to be angry and pissed off because</text>
  <text start="414.9" dur="4.32">we already bailed out everything we</text>
  <text start="417.69" dur="3.3">already let the Fed do what they needed</text>
  <text start="419.22" dur="4.14">to do in 2008 they said it was going to</text>
  <text start="420.99" dur="4.56">be a lot better and here we are today</text>
  <text start="423.36" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;re back exactly where we started</text>
  <text start="425.55" dur="3.96">because they didn&amp;#39;t make anything better</text>
  <text start="427.47" dur="4.2">the central bank system cannot be</text>
  <text start="429.51" dur="2.76">repaired Trump knows this the Patriots</text>
  <text start="431.67" dur="3.3">know</text>
  <text start="432.27" dur="6.39">this is why they&amp;#39;re driving it to the</text>
  <text start="434.97" dur="4.77">edge of the cliff to make it fall off in</text>
  <text start="438.66" dur="4.11">the very end</text>
  <text start="439.74" dur="4.56">now remember when Trump came out and he</text>
  <text start="442.77" dur="4.019">was at the UN and he talked about the</text>
  <text start="444.3" dur="7.739">globalist saying that they have no</text>
  <text start="446.789" dur="9.841">future in this world well the central</text>
  <text start="452.039" dur="6.091">bankers decided to respond to this which</text>
  <text start="456.63" dur="5.159">means they&amp;#39;re on a defensive first</text>
  <text start="458.13" dur="7.469">listen to what Trump said the future</text>
  <text start="461.789" dur="6.901">does not belong to globalists the future</text>
  <text start="465.599" dur="7.171">belongs to Patriots the future belongs</text>
  <text start="468.69" dur="6.24">to sovereign and independent nations who</text>
  <text start="472.77" dur="5.13">protect their citizens respect their</text>
  <text start="474.93" dur="7.829">neighbors and honor the differences that</text>
  <text start="477.9" dur="7.59">make each country special and unique now</text>
  <text start="482.759" dur="5.19">when Trump says globalist yes he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="485.49" dur="4.679">talking to those low-level globalists</text>
  <text start="487.949" dur="4.65">that are pushing their own agendas but</text>
  <text start="490.169" dur="6.571">mainly he&amp;#39;s talking to the central bank</text>
  <text start="492.599" dur="5.341">and the central bank understands what</text>
  <text start="496.74" dur="4.019">he&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="497.94" dur="6.779">because they received the message and</text>
  <text start="500.759" dur="5.611">they decided to respond Robert Kaplan</text>
  <text start="504.719" dur="5.581">president of the Federal Reserve Bank of</text>
  <text start="506.37" dur="6.299">Dallas said globalization and immigrants</text>
  <text start="510.3" dur="5.099">are needed for the United States to</text>
  <text start="512.669" dur="4.8">thrive he said the following the</text>
  <text start="515.399" dur="4.02">narrative in the last several years has</text>
  <text start="517.469" dur="5.37">been that if your job is being disrupted</text>
  <text start="519.419" dur="5.73">in Wisconsin or Ohio or anywhere it is</text>
  <text start="522.839" dur="4.081">probably due to globalization either an</text>
  <text start="525.149" dur="4.351">immigration may have affected your wages</text>
  <text start="526.92" dur="4.65">or taking your job or trade is the</text>
  <text start="529.5" dur="3.81">reason but if you think you are actually</text>
  <text start="531.57" dur="5.22">going to cut the number of immigrants</text>
  <text start="533.31" dur="4.44">and grow GDP those things do not quite</text>
  <text start="536.79" dur="3.15">go together</text>
  <text start="537.75" dur="4.43">in an aging population where the</text>
  <text start="539.94" dur="4.95">domestic born workforce is shrinking</text>
  <text start="542.18" dur="5.29">globalization is an opportunity for the</text>
  <text start="544.89" dur="4.71">United States if we get that diagnosis</text>
  <text start="547.47" dur="3.72">wrong we&amp;#39;re going to make poor policy</text>
  <text start="549.6" dur="5.37">decisions regarding trade and</text>
  <text start="551.19" dur="5.519">immigration and grow more slowly why did</text>
  <text start="554.97" dur="3.929">the central banker globalist one</text>
  <text start="556.709" dur="3.5">immigration well first they want to</text>
  <text start="558.899" dur="3.93">blend the countries together without</text>
  <text start="560.209" dur="4.32">identity it&amp;#39;s a lot easier for them to</text>
  <text start="562.829" dur="4.88">make a one-world government and a</text>
  <text start="564.529" dur="6.271">or bulk currency but having immigrants</text>
  <text start="567.709" dur="6.12">coming to this country and any a lot of</text>
  <text start="570.8" dur="4.5">them right now it allows the central</text>
  <text start="573.829" dur="4.351">bank system and that&amp;#39;s the key the</text>
  <text start="575.3" dur="5.699">central bank system to stay operational</text>
  <text start="578.18" dur="5.94">think about it the central bank system</text>
  <text start="580.999" dur="5.46">is continually devaluing their own</text>
  <text start="584.12" dur="5.759">currency by creating more and more</text>
  <text start="586.459" dur="6.69">currency and they are putting countries</text>
  <text start="589.879" dur="6.57">and people into debt once you hit a</text>
  <text start="593.149" dur="6.031">certain point people can&amp;#39;t take on more</text>
  <text start="596.449" dur="6.06">debt countries cannot take on more debt</text>
  <text start="599.18" dur="6.269">which means the people cannot pay that</text>
  <text start="602.509" dur="6.93">interest on that debt it&amp;#39;s quite</text>
  <text start="605.449" dur="6.87">impossible so the central bank they need</text>
  <text start="609.439" dur="6.301">to have more and more bodies in the</text>
  <text start="612.319" dur="8.341">country and why they take the low-level</text>
  <text start="615.74" dur="10.289">jobs now they can add debt and they can</text>
  <text start="620.66" dur="9.06">add to pay for the debt load of the</text>
  <text start="626.029" dur="5.761">country remember this is their system</text>
  <text start="629.72" dur="2.729">that&amp;#39;s the way it&amp;#39;s designed in their</text>
  <text start="631.79" dur="7.2">system</text>
  <text start="632.449" dur="9.99">if we remove their system guess what we</text>
  <text start="638.99" dur="5.13">don&amp;#39;t have to do what they&amp;#39;re saying yes</text>
  <text start="642.439" dur="4.38">you still have to let people into the</text>
  <text start="644.12" dur="5.459">country and again those people go to the</text>
  <text start="646.819" dur="5.661">point of entry but you don&amp;#39;t need the</text>
  <text start="649.579" dur="6.2">masses coming in like they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="652.48" dur="7.229">just remember we wouldn&amp;#39;t be borrowing</text>
  <text start="655.779" dur="5.771">the currency with interest attached</text>
  <text start="659.709" dur="5.38">where they need more and more</text>
  <text start="661.55" dur="6.389">individuals in the country to pay for</text>
  <text start="665.089" dur="6.29">that debt load because the people</text>
  <text start="667.939" dur="5.37">already here won&amp;#39;t be able to do it and</text>
  <text start="671.379" dur="4.031">he&amp;#39;s right about one thing</text>
  <text start="673.309" dur="5.13">is yes part of the population is getting</text>
  <text start="675.41" dur="6.69">older but to pay for that interest every</text>
  <text start="678.439" dur="6.63">single year it&amp;#39;s completely impossible</text>
  <text start="682.1" dur="6.63">unless you bring in thousands or even</text>
