  <text start="73.14" dur="2.88">moving up and up and up and the</text>
  <text start="74.67" dur="3.949">corporate media is making a big deal</text>
  <text start="76.02" dur="4.83">about this as a trump euphoria</text>
  <text start="78.619" dur="7.721">unbelievable and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="80.85" dur="7.769">trying to take what is happening in the</text>
  <text start="86.34" dur="5.669">market and they want to hook it to</text>
  <text start="88.619" dur="8.191">Donald Trump and what is happening right</text>
  <text start="92.009" dur="7.681">now is they&amp;#39;re trying to get everything</text>
  <text start="96.81" dur="5.88">together so they can blame it on Trump</text>
  <text start="99.69" dur="6.06">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that when</text>
  <text start="102.69" dur="4.709">Obama was in office these statistical</text>
  <text start="105.75" dur="4.53">numbers look fantastic everything was</text>
  <text start="107.399" dur="6.091">great and then once the election was</text>
  <text start="110.28" dur="5.159">over all of a sudden we can see that the</text>
  <text start="113.49" dur="4.41">statistical numbers well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="115.439" dur="5.25">starting to change and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="117.9" dur="4.89">doing slowly but surely is they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="120.689" dur="4.201">to link everything that he&amp;#39;s doing with</text>
  <text start="122.79" dur="5.37">the economy failing now this is why</text>
  <text start="124.89" dur="5.039">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking the economic</text>
  <text start="128.16" dur="4.23">collapse what has been happening in the</text>
  <text start="129.929" dur="4.861">economy for a long time so they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="132.39" dur="4.74">say hey look all of a sudden things</text>
  <text start="134.79" dur="3.33">started going the opposite direction so</text>
  <text start="137.13" dur="3.54">what they&amp;#39;re going to be doing is</text>
  <text start="138.12" dur="5.04">unemployment will start to rise initial</text>
  <text start="140.67" dur="4.11">jobless claims will start to rise the</text>
  <text start="143.16" dur="3.419">housing market will get worse and</text>
  <text start="144.78" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;ll start saying it&amp;#39;s because of</text>
  <text start="146.579" dur="5.701">Trump&amp;#39;s policies and we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="149.22" dur="5.97">starting to see some of this initial and</text>
  <text start="152.28" dur="5.09">continuing claims well they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="155.19" dur="5.12">trending lower and lower and lower</text>
  <text start="157.37" dur="6.429">towards the election period of time and</text>
  <text start="160.31" dur="7.8">while Obama was in the white house it</text>
  <text start="163.799" dur="8.611">looked fantastic was hit lows as low as</text>
  <text start="168.11" dur="6.849">1973 and ever since they&amp;#39;ve been moving</text>
  <text start="172.41" dur="4.59">up and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="174.959" dur="4.281">we talked about the Fed the feds</text>
  <text start="177" dur="4.61">national activity index</text>
  <text start="179.24" dur="5.76">that was doing absolutely awful actually</text>
  <text start="181.61" dur="5.79">was the opposite of what what was</text>
  <text start="185" dur="6.18">happening in initial jobless claims and</text>
  <text start="187.4" dur="5.28">continuing claims now as initial jobless</text>
  <text start="191.18" dur="4.19">claims and continuing claims are</text>
  <text start="192.68" dur="6.06">starting to move up we see that the Fed</text>
  <text start="195.37" dur="6.01">national activity index is going the</text>
  <text start="198.74" dur="4.74">opposite way so the central bankers</text>
  <text start="201.38" dur="4.74">right now the elite are saying hmm look</text>
  <text start="203.48" dur="7.74">at this we&amp;#39;re saying everything is fine</text>
  <text start="206.12" dur="7.88">and it looks like the economy is getting</text>
  <text start="211.22" dur="6.18">worse according to government statistics</text>
  <text start="214" dur="4.48">very interesting we see that new home</text>
  <text start="217.4" dur="5.18">sales right now</text>
  <text start="218.48" dur="6.78">well they&amp;#39;ve collapsed in December and</text>
  <text start="222.58" dur="6.73">they only expected a point seven percent</text>
  <text start="225.26" dur="7.35">decline but sales crashed by ten point</text>
  <text start="229.31" dur="6.75">four percent the most since March of</text>
  <text start="232.61" dur="6.51">2015 and they&amp;#39;re probably going to blame</text>
  <text start="236.06" dur="6.63">Trump for this why why all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="239.12" dur="4.89">would things start to change well when</text>
  <text start="242.69" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at the housing market</text>
  <text start="244.01" dur="5.22">they haven&amp;#39;t changed but now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="246.95" dur="5.31">reporting that the housing market isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="249.23" dur="5.25">doing as well as they thought and of</text>
  <text start="252.26" dur="6.8">course remember when he first came in he</text>
  <text start="254.48" dur="9.36">decided to reverse what Obama did with</text>
  <text start="259.06" dur="9.52">lowering the fees that subprime people</text>
  <text start="263.84" dur="7.1">would have to pay to get a loan so we</text>
  <text start="268.58" dur="5.67">can see already that they&amp;#39;re gonna blame</text>
  <text start="270.94" dur="5.53">the housing market turning down most</text>
  <text start="274.25" dur="4.11">likely on what he&amp;#39;s doing now this has</text>
  <text start="276.47" dur="4.46">nothing to do with that the housing</text>
  <text start="278.36" dur="5.79">market was turning down way before that</text>
  <text start="280.93" dur="6.15">they were trying to lessen the fees to</text>
  <text start="284.15" dur="5.54">bring more people in to blow up the debt</text>
  <text start="287.08" dur="5.52">but what we see happening right now is</text>
  <text start="289.69" dur="5.68">there are a lot of things occurring and</text>
  <text start="292.6" dur="5.71">things are rapidly falling apart and if</text>
  <text start="295.37" dur="7.86">we look we can see that the Midwest</text>
  <text start="298.31" dur="6.39">crashed by 41% and it&amp;#39;s just absolutely</text>
  <text start="303.23" dur="3.18">awful and mortgage apps</text>
  <text start="304.7" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;ve been declining they have a</text>
  <text start="306.41" dur="5.46">little pop up but things are actually</text>
  <text start="309.38" dur="4.77">getting worse</text>
  <text start="311.87" dur="7.019">and as time moves on it is not going to</text>
  <text start="314.15" dur="9">get any better whatsoever now it seems</text>
  <text start="318.889" dur="8.221">to be a strange coincidence that the Dow</text>
  <text start="323.15" dur="7.739">hit 20,000 points and we&amp;#39;re at almost 20</text>
  <text start="327.11" dur="7.619">trillion dollars worth of debt and we</text>
  <text start="330.889" dur="6.211">have the number 20 on both here and what</text>
  <text start="334.729" dur="6.571">that tells us is that the stock market</text>
  <text start="337.1" dur="7.62">well it&amp;#39;s been pushed up by the debt by</text>
  <text start="341.3" dur="5.64">the creation of the free money and that</text>
  <text start="344.72" dur="4.56">is what we&amp;#39;re seeing and we know that</text>
  <text start="346.94" dur="4.17">this debt is unsustainable because the</text>
  <text start="349.28" dur="4.47">budget director that trump appointed</text>
  <text start="351.11" dur="5.01">well he already told us we have major</text>
  <text start="353.75" dur="5.46">problems coming up we have the debt</text>
  <text start="356.12" dur="4.769">ceiling vote coming up in March and we</text>
  <text start="359.21" dur="3.87">can see already that Trump is cutting a</text>
  <text start="360.889" dur="5.131">lot of programs he has a hiring freeze</text>
  <text start="363.08" dur="6.27">on government workers and we know that</text>
  <text start="366.02" dur="5.13">as we move forward that things well</text>
  <text start="369.35" dur="4.069">they&amp;#39;re gonna deteriorate very very</text>
  <text start="371.15" dur="5">quickly we&amp;#39;re already starting to see it</text>
  <text start="373.419" dur="4.601">Trump&amp;#39;s expected ambassador to the EU</text>
  <text start="376.15" dur="6.519">well he&amp;#39;s looking at the situation</text>
  <text start="378.02" dur="7.56">saying short the euro the EU is going to</text>
  <text start="382.669" dur="7.831">collapse in the next 12 to 18 months</text>
  <text start="385.58" dur="9.809">maybe even sooner now that&amp;#39;s quite scary</text>
  <text start="390.5" dur="10.71">and he did say the one thing I would do</text>
  <text start="395.389" dur="8.101">in 2017 is short the euro and we can see</text>
  <text start="401.21" dur="5.34">what&amp;#39;s happening out in Europe we can</text>
  <text start="403.49" dur="4.56">see the UK is about to leave we can see</text>
  <text start="406.55" dur="3.799">that Italy France and many other</text>
  <text start="408.05" dur="5.429">countries they&amp;#39;re gonna follow suit and</text>
  <text start="410.349" dur="6.061">the central bankers well they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="413.479" dur="6.181">fight to keep all these countries and</text>
  <text start="416.41" dur="7.509">which means when these countries start</text>
  <text start="419.66" dur="7.83">to leave one way or another the EU is</text>
  <text start="423.919" dur="6.171">going to have major problems we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="427.49" dur="7.07">see the eurozone completely break up and</text>
  <text start="430.09" dur="7.449">this is going to have a domino effect</text>
  <text start="434.56" dur="6.94">across Europe and then back into the</text>
  <text start="437.539" dur="6.421">states and we see right now that the</text>
  <text start="441.5" dur="3.45">eurozone is going to break up and now we</text>
  <text start="443.96" dur="2.73">have</text>
  <text start="444.95" dur="4.86">which a bank they&amp;#39;ve come out with a</text>
  <text start="446.69" dur="6.24">warning that the global economy well</text>
  <text start="449.81" dur="5.3">it&amp;#39;s about to roll over in Deutsche</text>

  <text start="470.15" dur="5.79">their all-time high much of which has</text>
  <text start="473.3" dur="5.9">been predicated on the relentless debt</text>

  <text start="503.48" dur="7.89">that this is very low and we know that</text>
  <text start="507.43" dur="6.07">it&amp;#39;s a complete illusion and what</text>
  <text start="511.37" dur="8.4">they&amp;#39;re saying is that things are</text>
  <text start="513.5" dur="8.63">starting to freeze up and everything is</text>
  <text start="519.77" dur="4.86">about to change</text>

  <text start="535.1" dur="9.96">to come in to the market I mean at this</text>
  <text start="540.38" dur="7.37">point we can see that things are getting</text>
  <text start="545.06" dur="6.18">ready to completely reverse themselves</text>
  <text start="547.75" dur="9.01">we can see that the central bank they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="551.24" dur="7.71">getting ready to change it up and show</text>
  <text start="556.76" dur="4.65">that the economy is deteriorating right</text>
  <text start="558.95" dur="4.71">now the numbers that are going to be</text>
  <text start="561.41" dur="3.9">coming out well they&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="563.66" dur="4.38">those great numbers anymore</text>
  <text start="565.31" dur="5.7">things are gonna slowly deteriorate over</text>
  <text start="568.04" dur="6.98">time because they need to set up the</text>
  <text start="571.01" dur="6.05">narrative that the economy now is</text>
  <text start="575.02" dur="4.38">getting worse</text>
  <text start="577.06" dur="5.7">we went through eight years of</text>
  <text start="579.4" dur="7.53">incredible growth the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="582.76" dur="7.53">fantastic and now it&amp;#39;s slowing and as</text>
  <text start="586.93" dur="6.48">Trump puts his policies forward things</text>
  <text start="590.29" dur="5.52">are going to get worse this is the story</text>
  <text start="593.41" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re going to tell and we can see it</text>
  <text start="595.81" dur="6.17">has already started and we know for a</text>
  <text start="598.18" dur="7.59">fact that we&amp;#39;ve had no growth whatsoever</text>
  <text start="601.98" dur="10.9">the entire eight years it has been one</text>
  <text start="605.77" dur="9.72">big illusion to trick the people I mean</text>
  <text start="612.88" dur="5.91">if we go back in time we&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="615.49" dur="5.43">at retail has that improved no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="618.79" dur="5.52">contracted we&amp;#39;ve seen more and more</text>
  <text start="620.92" dur="6.3">stores closed every single year more and</text>
  <text start="624.31" dur="8.07">more people get laid off have corporate</text>
  <text start="627.22" dur="6.69">profits improved no they have not how</text>
  <text start="632.38" dur="2.04">did they make the housing market look</text>
  <text start="633.91" dur="2.67">good</text>
  <text start="634.42" dur="3.81">well they blew up bubbles in 20</text>
  <text start="636.58" dur="3.3">different cities with free money</text>
  <text start="638.23" dur="3.93">they told hedge funds investment</text>
  <text start="639.88" dur="4.38">companies buy as much as you can don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="642.16" dur="4.47">sell them keep them off the market banks</text>
  <text start="644.26" dur="5.7">same thing don&amp;#39;t foreclose keep them off</text>
  <text start="646.63" dur="9.24">the market pushes prices up speculators</text>
  <text start="649.96" dur="10.29">come in GDP they work they reworked</text>
  <text start="655.87" dur="6.9">those numbers they added health expenses</text>
  <text start="660.25" dur="3.72">in there they added research and</text>
  <text start="662.77" dur="3.45">development that went all the way back</text>
  <text start="663.97" dur="6.57">to 1929 we calculated all the way to the</text>
  <text start="666.22" dur="6.51">present time the last GDP numbers that</text>
  <text start="670.54" dur="6.95">came out that were 3.2 that was an</text>
  <text start="672.73" dur="8.28">export of soybeans a one-off thing</text>
  <text start="677.49" dur="6.07">so we can see that everything they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="681.01" dur="4.17">been talking about well it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="683.56" dur="4.08">illusion for a very long time and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="685.18" dur="7.47">heading towards an inflationary</text>
  <text start="687.64" dur="5.64">depression it&amp;#39;s coming and this is just</text>
