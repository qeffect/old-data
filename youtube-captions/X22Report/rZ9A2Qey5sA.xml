  <text start="163.87" dur="5.55">at this point has not helped the</text>
  <text start="166.299" dur="6.75">situation at all but we could see that</text>
  <text start="169.42" dur="6.93">this was part a of a different agenda it</text>
  <text start="173.049" dur="5.071">was to ban cash it was a test and just</text>
  <text start="176.35" dur="3.28">like they had the test of the balance in</text>
  <text start="178.12" dur="3.25">cyprus</text>
  <text start="179.63" dur="4.5">this is what the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="181.37" dur="6.78">doing they are testing different areas</text>
  <text start="184.13" dur="7.19">to see how people react to see how the</text>
  <text start="188.15" dur="7.68">country reacts the government reacts</text>
  <text start="191.32" dur="8.1">because they understand that as we move</text>
  <text start="195.83" dur="9.18">forward they need to take certain</text>
  <text start="199.42" dur="8.2">approaches to certain areas one being</text>
  <text start="205.01" dur="6.6">cash because they understand the balance</text>
  <text start="207.62" dur="5.76">work pretty darn good in Cyprus not many</text>
  <text start="211.61" dur="5.43">people complained they just went along</text>
  <text start="213.38" dur="6.57">with the entire thing then we had Greece</text>
  <text start="217.04" dur="5.1">and Greece realized what happened in</text>
  <text start="219.95" dur="4.91">Cyprus and they started to take their</text>
  <text start="222.14" dur="5.61">currency out of the banking system and</text>
  <text start="224.86" dur="4.96">what happened was well it was very</text>
  <text start="227.75" dur="3.84">difficult to do balance because they</text>
  <text start="229.82" dur="4.23">lost a lot of the currency in the</text>
  <text start="231.59" dur="3.54">banking system so and then they thought</text>
  <text start="234.05" dur="3.42">to themselves we&amp;#39;ll wait a minute</text>
  <text start="235.13" dur="3.63">okay the balance went okay but then</text>
  <text start="237.47" dur="2.82">other countries realized what was</text>
  <text start="238.76" dur="4.02">happening and they were taking their</text>
  <text start="240.29" dur="4.65">currency out of the banking system how</text>
  <text start="242.78" dur="4.47">can we stop this well we can ban cash</text>
  <text start="244.94" dur="4.08">and this is the point we&amp;#39;re at right now</text>
  <text start="247.25" dur="3.57">because they realized we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="249.02" dur="4.71">closer and closer to that point where</text>
  <text start="250.82" dur="6.45">the economy&amp;#39;s coming down now yesterday</text>

  <text start="261.049" dur="7.231">IRS from the FDIC and the search warrant</text>
  <text start="265.01" dur="4.83">right now it might be connected in part</text>
  <text start="268.28" dur="4.62">to a previous matter related to the</text>
  <text start="269.84" dur="4.95">company&amp;#39;s switzerland-based subsidiary</text>

  <text start="321.63" dur="5.13">part of a restructuring plan but really</text>
  <text start="324.09" dur="6.06">what this is is that they&amp;#39;re not doing</text>

  <text start="360.45" dur="4.08">shopping there but they&amp;#39;re getting hit</text>
  <text start="361.919" dur="5.581">by inflation and they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="364.53" dur="5.82">raising their membership fees because</text>
  <text start="367.5" dur="5.25">what is happening is the cost of</text>

  <text start="386.19" dur="4.68">have a problem but this is the first</text>
  <text start="388.86" dur="3.2">sign that they&amp;#39;re in some type of</text>
  <text start="390.87" dur="5.25">trouble</text>
  <text start="392.06" dur="8.05">now remember Costco is the second</text>
  <text start="396.12" dur="7.35">largest retailer right behind Walmart</text>

  <text start="427.35" dur="3.39">saying it&amp;#39;s a bad thing but at this</text>
  <text start="429.12" dur="4.71">point the way the economy is with the</text>
  <text start="430.74" dur="5.22">amount of debt and what all the past</text>
  <text start="433.83" dur="4.08">administrations have done along with the</text>
  <text start="435.96" dur="5.25">central bank and that is the main</text>
  <text start="437.91" dur="4.92">problem you just can&amp;#39;t say okay we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="441.21" dur="3.12">going to bring back jobs and they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="442.83" dur="3.25">here in the next couple of months and</text>
  <text start="444.33" dur="3.13">everything will be fine</text>
  <text start="446.08" dur="4.14">first of all we&amp;#39;ve gotten rid of</text>
  <text start="447.46" dur="5.729">manufacturing we&amp;#39;ve sent this all</text>
  <text start="450.22" dur="6.169">overseas we&amp;#39;d have to rebuild the</text>
  <text start="453.189" dur="8.91">infrastructure rebuild the manufacturing</text>
  <text start="456.389" dur="7.691">plants train individuals I mean there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="462.099" dur="4.47">a lot of work and this can&amp;#39;t be done in</text>
  <text start="464.08" dur="5.01">a short short period of time because the</text>
  <text start="466.569" dur="4.19">economy throughout the all the other</text>
  <text start="469.09" dur="4.859">administrations with the central bank</text>
  <text start="470.759" dur="7.861">well they&amp;#39;ve been ripping it apart for</text>
  <text start="473.949" dur="8.31">years and now the entire world is</text>
  <text start="478.62" dur="7.5">flooded with all of this debt with</text>
  <text start="482.259" dur="6.391">negative or very low interest rates and</text>
  <text start="486.12" dur="4.539">when we look we can see that there are</text>
  <text start="488.65" dur="3.81">many individuals out there saying that</text>
  <text start="490.659" dur="3.72">we&amp;#39;re not going to make it to the second</text>
  <text start="492.46" dur="4.199">half of the year now do we know for sure</text>
  <text start="494.379" dur="4.231">that this is the exact time frame now we</text>
  <text start="496.659" dur="4.891">don&amp;#39;t have a crystal ball let&amp;#39;s be</text>
  <text start="498.61" dur="5.279">serious about this but what we do know</text>
  <text start="501.55" dur="6.239">is that we&amp;#39;ve been watching indicators</text>
  <text start="503.889" dur="6.27">and we&amp;#39;ve learned how the Fed can keep</text>
  <text start="507.789" dur="7.29">the system going by kicking the can down</text>
  <text start="510.159" dur="7.38">the street the problem now is they have</text>
  <text start="515.079" dur="4.411">an individual in the White House that</text>
  <text start="517.539" dur="4.98">most likely is not going to cooperate</text>
  <text start="519.49" dur="5.55">with what they want to do and that is</text>
  <text start="522.519" dur="4.741">globalism this is a problem for them</text>
  <text start="525.04" dur="6.989">think about what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="527.26" dur="8.97">and since it is a problem they realize</text>
  <text start="532.029" dur="6.18">that the economy will not be able to</text>
  <text start="536.23" dur="6.02">survive and they don&amp;#39;t want to lose</text>
  <text start="538.209" dur="5.971">control over what is about to happen and</text>

  <text start="566.019" dur="4.801">that the Fed now is tightening and every</text>
  <text start="568.209" dur="6.841">time they tighten the system comes down</text>
