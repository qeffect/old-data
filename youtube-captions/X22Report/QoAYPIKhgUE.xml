  <text start="141.38" dur="3.9">didn&amp;#39;t want people to know about it and</text>
  <text start="142.93" dur="5.77">we see right now the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="145.28" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;re not even covering the protests</text>
  <text start="148.7" dur="9.78">and how the people do not want the TTIP</text>
  <text start="151.43" dur="11.19">the TPP seta and the protests well they</text>
  <text start="158.48" dur="6.75">stretch from Paris to Warsaw and people</text>
  <text start="162.62" dur="4.199">were out there demonstrating saying that</text>
  <text start="165.23" dur="6.45">we don&amp;#39;t want any of these trade deals</text>
  <text start="166.819" dur="8.611">and they were chanting human souls first</text>
  <text start="171.68" dur="6.69">and profits later and we can see that</text>
  <text start="175.43" dur="5.639">this is the beginning of people coming</text>
  <text start="178.37" dur="5.429">together and we need to see more of the</text>
  <text start="181.069" dur="6.051">where people look at what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="183.799" dur="6.27">around them they realize your neighbor</text>
  <text start="187.12" dur="5.56">your family members just because they</text>
  <text start="190.069" dur="5.961">have a difference of opinion a different</text>
  <text start="192.68" dur="5.369">view on who they like as a candidate or</text>
  <text start="196.03" dur="4.65">if there are different religion</text>
  <text start="198.049" dur="7.19">different color it makes no difference</text>
  <text start="200.68" dur="9.19">we&amp;#39;re all the same we are the people and</text>
  <text start="205.239" dur="8.47">we need to stop we need to come together</text>
  <text start="209.87" dur="6.539">and fight the common enemy and we can</text>
  <text start="213.709" dur="4.89">see its beginning where people have</text>
  <text start="216.409" dur="4.08">gotten together to fight this trade deal</text>
  <text start="218.599" dur="3.901">because they realized how bad it is and</text>
  <text start="220.489" dur="4.881">we need to spread this we need to</text>
  <text start="222.5" dur="6.599">continue this on because if we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="225.37" dur="8.009">these central bankers will rule us the</text>
  <text start="229.099" dur="9.801">government&amp;#39;s will be taken over by a</text>
  <text start="233.379" dur="10.48">one-world government we will lose rights</text>
  <text start="238.9" dur="6.459">they will make sure of it and we need to</text>
  <text start="243.859" dur="4.59">do something about it and we can see</text>
  <text start="245.359" dur="7.201">right now we are headed to war we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="248.449" dur="7.44">headed to a collapse this is the time</text>
  <text start="252.56" dur="7.859">where we can object to what they want to</text>
  <text start="255.889" dur="7.381">do and that is go to war send our</text>
  <text start="260.419" dur="6.301">brothers and sisters our children to be</text>
  <text start="263.27" dur="7.619">killed to reduce the population so their</text>
  <text start="266.72" dur="7.14">entire mess their lies over the years</text>
  <text start="270.889" dur="5.25">over the many many many years are</text>
  <text start="273.86" dur="7.619">completely covered up so they can repeat</text>
  <text start="276.139" dur="6.991">this whole entire process again and we</text>
  <text start="281.479" dur="3.72">can see there is a time and a place</text>
  <text start="283.13" dur="6.81">where we&amp;#39;re gonna have to come together</text>
  <text start="285.199" dur="7.381">and say no more it&amp;#39;s enough we need</text>
  <text start="289.94" dur="5.13">people in government that have a</text>
  <text start="292.58" dur="4.8">backbone that will say no to the central</text>
  <text start="295.07" dur="3.96">bank it&amp;#39;s time to get rid of you we</text>
  <text start="297.38" dur="5.759">really don&amp;#39;t need you there&amp;#39;s no purpose</text>
  <text start="299.03" dur="6.3">for a central bank the government who is</text>
  <text start="303.139" dur="4.291">working for the people can create the</text>
  <text start="305.33" dur="4.17">currency we don&amp;#39;t need to create</text>
  <text start="307.43" dur="4.289">currency attach it to interests have the</text>
  <text start="309.5" dur="5.199">government create bonds sell them back</text>
  <text start="311.719" dur="7.6">to the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="314.699" dur="10.351">and have the central bank manage the</text>
  <text start="319.319" dur="10.5">economy for them we don&amp;#39;t need that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.05" dur="7.369">meaningless now out in the Philippines</text>
  <text start="329.819" dur="5.07">we can see things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="332.419" dur="5.8">deteriorating for the central bankers</text>
  <text start="334.889" dur="5.61">the US government because Duterte right</text>
  <text start="338.219" dur="6">now decided I&amp;#39;m gonna pivot away from</text>
  <text start="340.499" dur="8.79">the United States and he signed on to</text>
  <text start="344.219" dur="6.931">China&amp;#39;s new Silk Road and this signals a</text>
  <text start="349.289" dur="5.4">start of a bilateral friendship between</text>
  <text start="351.15" dur="5.16">the two countries and this will activate</text>
  <text start="354.689" dur="5.34">trade between the Philippines and other</text>
  <text start="356.31" dur="6.449">Silk Road member countries and this will</text>
  <text start="360.029" dur="5.13">expand to other countries around the</text>
  <text start="362.759" dur="3.87">South China Sea now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="365.159" dur="2.88">interesting about this because remember</text>
  <text start="366.629" dur="4.081">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="368.039" dur="5.761">bankers have been making a very big deal</text>
  <text start="370.71" dur="6.12">about the South China Sea and the right</text>
  <text start="373.8" dur="5.429">to free navigation which by the way the</text>
  <text start="376.83" dur="4.92">United States never signed never</text>
  <text start="379.229" dur="4.41">ratified so I don&amp;#39;t even know why</text>
  <text start="381.75" dur="3.289">they&amp;#39;re out there telling everyone they</text>
  <text start="383.639" dur="5.93">have the right to free navigation</text>
  <text start="385.039" dur="8.35">because they never signed it but anyhow</text>
  <text start="389.569" dur="6.491">China and the Philippines they decided</text>
  <text start="393.389" dur="4.62">to sit down with each other the</text>
  <text start="396.06" dur="5.009">Philippine Lido duterte and the</text>

  <text start="424.979" dur="4.68">Chinese President there is no sense</text>
  <text start="427.589" dur="4.411">fighting over a body of water it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="429.659" dur="6.12">better to talk about it you signed on</text>

  <text start="451.44" dur="6.24">no reason to be hostile there&amp;#39;s no</text>

  <text start="476.22" dur="8.4">need to provoke China in this area and</text>
  <text start="480.44" dur="8.08">we can see that there&amp;#39;s absolutely no</text>
  <text start="484.62" dur="8.67">reason for this we can see that the</text>
  <text start="488.52" dur="9.24">United States created all of this again</text>
  <text start="493.29" dur="6.57">out of thin air to create a problem in</text>
  <text start="497.76" dur="3.72">this area now other countries are going</text>
  <text start="499.86" dur="4.29">to look at this and so we&amp;#39;ll wait a</text>
  <text start="501.48" dur="4.2">minute the Philippines they can bring</text>
  <text start="504.15" dur="6.3">their ships into this area and China is</text>
  <text start="505.68" dur="6.72">fine with it why don&amp;#39;t we do the same we</text>
  <text start="510.45" dur="5.21">don&amp;#39;t have to have this fight we don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="521.88" dur="5.67">especially if it goes nuclear so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="525.93" dur="4.56">saying that other countries are going to</text>
  <text start="527.55" dur="5.22">look at this and say yeah let&amp;#39;s not stay</text>
  <text start="530.49" dur="3.99">with the United States on this one let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="532.77" dur="3">do what the Philippines are doing and</text>
  <text start="534.48" dur="3.03">now the United States government central</text>
  <text start="535.77" dur="4.61">bankers they&amp;#39;re not going to like this</text>
  <text start="537.51" dur="6.75">and I would expect something to happen</text>
  <text start="540.38" dur="5.47">very shortly in this area and this is</text>
  <text start="544.26" dur="4.17">something that we need to watch because</text>
  <text start="545.85" dur="5.01">we can see right now this is not what</text>
  <text start="548.43" dur="6.6">the US government central bankers want</text>
  <text start="550.86" dur="6.45">at all now as we mentioned yesterday we</text>
  <text start="555.03" dur="5.01">have the Normandy for talks going on</text>
  <text start="557.31" dur="6.66">today we have all the leaders along</text>
  <text start="560.04" dur="6.63">merkel putin poroshenko all together</text>
  <text start="563.97" dur="5.22">talking about the Minsk agreements and</text>
  <text start="566.67" dur="5.04">right now Russia is looking at the</text>
  <text start="569.19" dur="5.61">situation saying it does not see any</text>
  <text start="571.71" dur="6.48">hope with the Minsk agreements the</text>
  <text start="574.8" dur="5.47">problem is that Kiev is never going to</text>
  <text start="578.19" dur="4.33">abide by them</text>
  <text start="580.27" dur="5.13">and it looks like they&amp;#39;re discussing it</text>
  <text start="582.52" dur="5.76">but it looks like this is gonna go</text>
  <text start="585.4" dur="5.64">nowhere and at the same time this is</text>
  <text start="588.28" dur="5.79">happening we&amp;#39;re getting reports that</text>
  <text start="591.04" dur="6.08">foreign mercenaries they have arrived on</text>
  <text start="594.07" dur="5.91">the contact line of Don bass and</text>
  <text start="597.12" dur="5.59">countries like Poland the Baltic States</text>
  <text start="599.98" dur="5.4">Canada and the US are sending in foreign</text>
  <text start="602.71" dur="5.37">mercenaries into this area they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="605.38" dur="5.97">setting up training camps right in this</text>
  <text start="608.08" dur="6.53">area and they&amp;#39;re arriving with us-made</text>
  <text start="611.35" dur="5.58">assault rifles off-road vehicles</text>
  <text start="614.61" dur="5.11">infantry combat vehicles armored</text>
  <text start="616.93" dur="4.35">fighting vehicles and we can see right</text>
  <text start="619.72" dur="5.04">now the United States government central</text>
  <text start="621.28" dur="6.21">bankers they don&amp;#39;t want ceasefire they</text>
  <text start="624.76" dur="4.71">do not want peace they want what they</text>
  <text start="627.49" dur="5.46">paid for it they paid for a coup d&amp;#39;etat</text>
  <text start="629.47" dur="7.71">cost them five billion dollars to oust</text>
  <text start="632.95" dur="6.81">the elected president in Ukraine they</text>
  <text start="637.18" dur="4.86">didn&amp;#39;t get Crimea they didn&amp;#39;t get the</text>
  <text start="639.76" dur="4.47">southeastern section and they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="642.04" dur="3.96">ready to take it back and this is</text>
  <text start="644.23" dur="4.86">something that we need to watch we see</text>
  <text start="646" dur="5.94">out in North Korea defense secretary ash</text>
  <text start="649.09" dur="5.79">Carter is out there screaming and</text>
  <text start="651.94" dur="5.28">yelling and warning north warning the</text>
  <text start="654.88" dur="4.89">United States and its allies that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="657.22" dur="7.29">worry if North Korea fires a nuclear</text>
  <text start="659.77" dur="8.6">missile the US will respond we will</text>
  <text start="664.51" dur="6.93">respond with an overwhelming US response</text>
  <text start="668.37" dur="4.6">now of course this is during the time</text>
  <text start="671.44" dur="4.08">period where they want to get that bad</text>
  <text start="672.97" dur="4.56">missile system into South Korea so</text>
  <text start="675.52" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re blowing it completely out of</text>
  <text start="677.53" dur="5.88">proportion it would make no sense</text>
  <text start="680.02" dur="5.82">whatsoever for North Korea to attack any</text>
  <text start="683.41" dur="4.8">of the allies first of all what would be</text>
  <text start="685.84" dur="5.01">the motive to fire a nuclear missile at</text>
  <text start="688.21" dur="4.62">them if they do that think about the</text>
  <text start="690.85" dur="4.11">number of nuclear weapons that would be</text>
  <text start="692.83" dur="5.76">fired back at North Korea North Korea</text>
  <text start="694.96" dur="5.76">would not exist any more so this would</text>
  <text start="698.59" dur="5.25">make no sense whatsoever this is all</text>
  <text start="700.72" dur="5.91">about bringing in more military assets</text>
  <text start="703.84" dur="5.58">into the region so when the United</text>
  <text start="706.63" dur="6.51">States starts the next war everything is</text>
  <text start="709.42" dur="3.959">in place and we can see right now this</text>
  <text start="713.14" dur="2.969">is</text>
  <text start="713.379" dur="7.71">exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing because in</text>
  <text start="716.109" dur="8.34">Norway we&amp;#39;re seeing that US troops are</text>
  <text start="721.089" dur="6.72">going to be placed inside of Norway as</text>
  <text start="724.449" dur="7.23">early as January and there will be you</text>
  <text start="727.809" dur="5.49">know on a rotating basis the first</text>
  <text start="731.679" dur="4.59">number of troops will be there will be</text>
  <text start="733.299" dur="5.16">about 300 or so and this will be right</text>
  <text start="736.269" dur="4.4">up on the border of Russia now of course</text>
  <text start="738.459" dur="5.1">this is because of Russian aggression</text>
  <text start="740.669" dur="5.59">but we can see right now military assets</text>
  <text start="743.559" dur="5.15">are being moved into position soldiers</text>
  <text start="746.259" dur="5">are being moved into position and</text>
  <text start="748.709" dur="6.22">there&amp;#39;s a reason why they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="751.259" dur="4.9">because they know eventually war is</text>
  <text start="754.929" dur="3.87">going to break out this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="756.159" dur="5.16">been placing military assets in caves</text>
  <text start="758.799" dur="6.63">replacing the old equipment bringing in</text>
  <text start="761.319" dur="6.03">new equipment and we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="765.429" dur="4.86">and tracking this for quite a while and</text>
  <text start="767.349" dur="8.78">everything is pretty much in place right</text>
  <text start="770.289" dur="8.64">now we see the United States is in Iraq</text>
  <text start="776.129" dur="6.221">they are on the front lines and muscle</text>
  <text start="778.929" dur="6.89">and the United States expects the</text>
  <text start="782.35" dur="7.739">Islamic state to use chemical weapons in</text>
  <text start="785.819" dur="8.98">muscle now if you really think about</text>
  <text start="790.089" dur="6.12">this this is a perfect cover where the</text>
  <text start="794.799" dur="3.63">United States can say they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="796.209" dur="4.261">chemical weapons everyone fall back</text>
  <text start="798.429" dur="4.65">let our soldiers who have the uniforms</text>
  <text start="800.47" dur="6.63">the protective gear to go forward it</text>
  <text start="803.079" dur="9.09">will enable them to allow the Islamic</text>
  <text start="807.1" dur="7.979">state to be moved covertly out of Iraq</text>
  <text start="812.169" dur="4.431">and into Syria and this has been their</text>
  <text start="815.079" dur="5.521">plan from the beginning they want these</text>
  <text start="816.6" dur="6.879">paid mercenaries to enter Syria</text>
  <text start="820.6" dur="5.219">to be then moved and filtered up into</text>
  <text start="823.479" dur="4.32">Aleppo area and this is what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="825.819" dur="6.84">been trying to do we see Russia they are</text>
  <text start="827.799" dur="8.04">now selling their warships to Syria they</text>
  <text start="832.659" dur="7.44">pass Norway Norway has some surveillance</text>
  <text start="835.839" dur="7.8">photos of the aircraft carrier and other</text>
  <text start="840.099" dur="5.211">warships there are seven in total and we</text>
  <text start="843.639" dur="4.431">can see right now</text>
  <text start="845.31" dur="6.78">that Russia realizes that the United</text>
  <text start="848.07" dur="7.11">States well they&amp;#39;re about to push the</text>
  <text start="852.09" dur="6.71">next event in this area it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="855.18" dur="7.23">planned they are preparing for it and</text>
  <text start="858.8" dur="5.38">Russia realizes that this is going to</text>
  <text start="862.41" dur="5.19">happen and this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="864.18" dur="6.3">bringing in the s-300 the s400 this is</text>
  <text start="867.6" dur="5.31">why their warships are sailing down into</text>
  <text start="870.48" dur="4.98">the Mediterranean this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="872.91" dur="6.33">rebuilding bases bringing you on</text>
  <text start="875.46" dur="6.66">bringing in more military assets because</text>
  <text start="879.24" dur="6.69">the United States again they&amp;#39;re backed</text>
  <text start="882.12" dur="7.79">in a corner and this is not going to end</text>
  <text start="885.93" dur="6.75">well at all we see the Syrian forces</text>
  <text start="889.91" dur="6.25">they have moved rebels and civilians</text>
  <text start="892.68" dur="6.09">from Damascus suburb and an estimated</text>
  <text start="896.16" dur="4.44">about 2,000 people including about 620</text>
  <text start="898.77" dur="3.78">rebels and their families have been</text>
  <text start="900.6" dur="5.01">bussed out of the area</text>
  <text start="902.55" dur="5.42">they took Syria up on the deal and they</text>
  <text start="905.61" dur="4.979">are moving them out of the area now</text>
  <text start="907.97" dur="6.6">Russia and Syria decided to come up with</text>
  <text start="910.589" dur="7.081">this ceasefire they started they stopped</text>
  <text start="914.57" dur="4.63">aerial bombing about 48 hours before the</text>
  <text start="917.67" dur="3.54">ceasefire and the ceasefire is about</text>
  <text start="919.2" dur="4.5">eight hours and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="921.21" dur="4.35">that the UN is refusing to deliver aid</text>
  <text start="923.7" dur="7.02">because they don&amp;#39;t have assurances or</text>
  <text start="925.56" dur="6.84">guarantees from the rebel groups because</text>
  <text start="930.72" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re worried that they will be</text>
  <text start="932.4" dur="5.01">attacked by the terrorist groups so</text>
  <text start="935.52" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re not moving aid in there at all</text>
  <text start="937.41" dur="4.74">so the United States came back and said</text>
  <text start="939.06" dur="7.22">ah see Russia is stopping the aid from</text>
  <text start="942.15" dur="7.92">coming in and Russia came back with no</text>
  <text start="946.28" dur="6.1">the Red Cross the UN said they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="950.07" dur="3.9">want to deliver the aid because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="952.38" dur="5.52">worried about what the terrorists are</text>
  <text start="953.97" dur="5.34">going to do your people and we can see</text>
  <text start="957.9" dur="5.42">right now the United States government</text>
  <text start="959.31" dur="6.42">central bankers they don&amp;#39;t want a</text>
  <text start="963.32" dur="4.99">short-term ceasefire they want a</text>
  <text start="965.73" dur="7.32">long-term ceasefire because this will</text>
  <text start="968.31" dur="7.47">keep Aleppo in limbo but Russia and</text>
  <text start="973.05" dur="4.77">Syria they realize no we need to clean</text>
  <text start="975.78" dur="3.37">this out we need to get rid of the u.s.</text>
  <text start="977.82" dur="4.54">the u.s. should</text>
  <text start="979.15" dur="5.82">even be in Syria France should not be in</text>
  <text start="982.36" dur="5.28">Syria the UK should not be in Syria they</text>
  <text start="984.97" dur="6.119">were never invited in they invaded a</text>
  <text start="987.64" dur="5.46">sovereign country we see the United</text>
  <text start="991.089" dur="3.69">States government central bankers well</text>
  <text start="993.1" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re destroying more and more</text>
  <text start="994.779" dur="7.381">infrastructure inside of Syria and Deir</text>
  <text start="997.57" dur="6.18">Ezzor they destroyed two bridges and we</text>
  <text start="1002.16" dur="4.32">can see right now they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="1003.75" dur="5.46">doing this because they&amp;#39;re trying to cut</text>
  <text start="1006.48" dur="7.4">off the area where they&amp;#39;re creating this</text>
  <text start="1009.21" dur="9.9">safe zone and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="1013.88" dur="7.93">Russia they are building an airbase or I</text>
  <text start="1019.11" dur="5.76">should say reconstructing the airfield</text>
  <text start="1021.81" dur="5.85">in eastern Syria and it&amp;#39;s the t4</text>
  <text start="1024.87" dur="6.209">military airport and this is about south</text>
  <text start="1027.66" dur="5.789">of Homs and they are reconstructing it</text>
  <text start="1031.079" dur="4.891">and they&amp;#39;re going to use it for the</text>
  <text start="1033.449" dur="6.151">attacks down in the southern part of</text>
  <text start="1035.97" dur="5.849">Syria and they&amp;#39;re saying that we can use</text>
  <text start="1039.6" dur="5.04">this airbase to attack the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1041.819" dur="4.711">to attack el Nostra to attack al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="1044.64" dur="3.569">now the United States government central</text>
  <text start="1046.53" dur="5.7">bankers and they don&amp;#39;t like this either</text>
  <text start="1048.209" dur="8.491">now Russia submitted a draft of a</text>
  <text start="1052.23" dur="7.56">proposal to the UNSC about separating</text>
  <text start="1056.7" dur="6.27">the Syrian rebels now very interestingly</text>
  <text start="1059.79" dur="6.15">and no one should be really surprised</text>
  <text start="1062.97" dur="7.38">about this the United Kingdom the United</text>
  <text start="1065.94" dur="7.02">States France Ukraine blocked Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1070.35" dur="6.69">draft supporting the eight-hour</text>
  <text start="1072.96" dur="6.3">humanitarian pause in Aleppo and the</text>
  <text start="1077.04" dur="7.56">separation of Syrian rebels and</text>
  <text start="1079.26" dur="9.48">terrorists so this is perfect</text>
  <text start="1084.6" dur="6.14">evidence right now once again that the</text>
  <text start="1088.74" dur="5.58">United States government and the</text>
  <text start="1090.74" dur="7.12">coalition forces back the terrorist</text>
  <text start="1094.32" dur="7.5">groups they&amp;#39;ve been putting this off and</text>
  <text start="1097.86" dur="5.85">off and off for a very long time because</text>
  <text start="1101.82" dur="5.46">there is no difference between the</text>
  <text start="1103.71" dur="6.12">moderate rebels and the terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="1107.28" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re one in the same and we just got</text>
  <text start="1109.83" dur="5.18">confirmation once again</text>
  <text start="1112.74" dur="6.6">we&amp;#39;re getting confirmation that the</text>
  <text start="1115.01" dur="5.85">Ecuadorian government well they were</text>
  <text start="1119.34" dur="5.61">pressured by the United States now</text>
  <text start="1120.86" dur="6.58">Ecuador saying we weren&amp;#39;t we decided to</text>
  <text start="1124.95" dur="4.88">cut the internet connection for Julian</text>
  <text start="1127.44" dur="7.859">Assange because it was a sovereign</text>
  <text start="1129.83" dur="8.05">decision what do they care they</text>
  <text start="1135.299" dur="4.38">shouldn&amp;#39;t care and really if you cut the</text>
  <text start="1137.88" dur="3.81">internet there do you think that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1139.679" dur="5.401">only place they&amp;#39;re getting the</text>
  <text start="1141.69" dur="6.719">information no they have access hubs all</text>
  <text start="1145.08" dur="6.599">around the world so this really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1148.409" dur="6.15">do anything but we can see from this the</text>
  <text start="1151.679" dur="5.281">United States government they were</text>
  <text start="1154.559" dur="5.401">trying to stop it they didn&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="1156.96" dur="6.079">information out there and that tells you</text>
  <text start="1159.96" dur="6.63">something right off the bat now Russia</text>
  <text start="1163.039" dur="7.601">they have created a closed internet</text>
  <text start="1166.59" dur="6.18">system for classified data exchange it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1170.64" dur="5.639">just like the Internet but the only way</text>
  <text start="1172.77" dur="6.269">to access it is through a Russian</text>
  <text start="1176.279" dur="7.291">computer operating system they will not</text>
  <text start="1179.039" dur="6.63">use Windows they will not use Apple they</text>
  <text start="1183.57" dur="6.329">created their own operating system and</text>
  <text start="1185.669" dur="7.801">that operating system has access to this</text>
  <text start="1189.899" dur="6.691">closed Internet system so once we get</text>
  <text start="1193.47" dur="6.3">into the world of cyber attacking this</text>
  <text start="1196.59" dur="4.86">is a closed off system where the US most</text>
  <text start="1199.77" dur="5.49">likely won&amp;#39;t be able to hit unless they</text>
  <text start="1201.45" dur="7.53">get someone inside to do something now</text>
  <text start="1205.26" dur="7.409">very interestingly we see the United</text>
  <text start="1208.98" dur="6.72">States has made an arrest and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1212.669" dur="5.911">saying we found the Russian hacker who</text>
  <text start="1215.7" dur="7.079">was hitting the election system who was</text>
  <text start="1218.58" dur="7.44">hitting the DNC and the arrest was made</text>
  <text start="1222.779" dur="7.681">on October 5th but they waited until</text>
  <text start="1226.02" dur="6.36">today to make the announcement you know</text>
  <text start="1230.46" dur="6.26">the day they&amp;#39;re going to have the</text>
  <text start="1232.38" dur="7.38">debates now this looks like it was</text>
  <text start="1236.72" dur="7.839">orchestrated it was tactically delayed</text>
  <text start="1239.76" dur="8.69">on purpose and most likely this</text>
  <text start="1244.559" dur="7.62">hacker had nothing to do whatsoever with</text>
  <text start="1248.45" dur="6.64">the DNC hack and the election hack</text>
  <text start="1252.179" dur="5.49">because as we know United States</text>
  <text start="1255.09" dur="6.99">government central bankers have never</text>
  <text start="1257.669" dur="8.97">shown any proof they only say allegedly</text>
  <text start="1262.08" dur="10.14">might have and this looks like this is</text>
  <text start="1266.639" dur="9">another stunt and of course as time will</text>
  <text start="1272.22" dur="5.669">certainly show us that this person most</text>
  <text start="1275.639" dur="7.5">likely had nothing to do it do with it</text>
  <text start="1277.889" dur="7.351">whatsoever now we understand Obama came</text>
  <text start="1283.139" dur="6.961">out and said the CIA is preparing to</text>
  <text start="1285.24" dur="6.779">cyber attack Russia now many people are</text>
  <text start="1290.1" dur="4.47">thinking well why would he announce this</text>
  <text start="1292.019" dur="5.581">why would he tell Russia they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1294.57" dur="6.12">to do this this wasn&amp;#39;t for Russia this</text>
  <text start="1297.6" dur="3.959">was for the American people and it</text>
  <text start="1300.69" dur="4.17">doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re going to do it</text>
  <text start="1301.559" dur="5.271">right this second their conditioning the</text>
  <text start="1304.86" dur="6.689">American people to understand that</text>
  <text start="1306.83" dur="9.039">Russia did something and the United</text>
  <text start="1311.549" dur="9.59">States is going to retaliate but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1315.869" dur="7.89">going to retaliate if they need to and</text>
  <text start="1321.139" dur="4.211">how do we know if they need to it all</text>
  <text start="1323.759" dur="4.561">depends on how the elections are going</text>
  <text start="1325.35" dur="6.439">and this is what they&amp;#39;ve been working on</text>
  <text start="1328.32" dur="9.839">it&amp;#39;s conditioning the American people</text>
  <text start="1331.789" dur="10.47">because if these elections are in favor</text>
  <text start="1338.159" dur="5.691">of Trump we can see they can use a</text>
  <text start="1342.259" dur="4.691">cyberattack</text>
  <text start="1343.85" dur="4.659">point the finger at Russia and say now</text>
  <text start="1346.95" dur="3.24">we need to retaliate because at this</text>
  <text start="1348.509" dur="3.721">point they don&amp;#39;t care they didn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="1350.19" dur="4.439">their person in there they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1352.23" dur="4.23">start a war and it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if</text>
  <text start="1354.629" dur="3.811">Russia knows or doesn&amp;#39;t know this was</text>
  <text start="1356.46" dur="5">precondition to let the American people</text>
  <text start="1358.44" dur="5.67">know this is what&amp;#39;s going to happen and</text>
  <text start="1361.46" dur="8.28">we can see there there were many</text>
  <text start="1364.11" dur="8.64">different events that would trigger a</text>
  <text start="1369.74" dur="5.98">state of emergency martial law in the</text>
  <text start="1372.75" dur="5.49">United States and we can see with the</text>
  <text start="1375.72" dur="3.87">elections coming up we have many</text>
  <text start="1378.24" dur="2.52">and things that they can use and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1379.59" dur="3.51">been talking about them for quite a</text>
