  <text start="162.7" dur="5.44">the UK</text>
  <text start="164.3" dur="9.03">to leave the EU now we know that they</text>
  <text start="168.14" dur="8.07">had many different plans to stop the UK</text>
  <text start="173.33" dur="6.81">from leaving but guess what they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="176.21" dur="7.11">failing and as we can see everything</text>

  <text start="220.82" dur="7.97">to block Britain&amp;#39;s exit from the</text>
  <text start="224.57" dur="7.71">collective and it will not accept terms</text>
  <text start="228.79" dur="5.89">think about what is happening here they</text>
  <text start="232.28" dur="4.5">are pushing their agenda and telling</text>

  <text start="245.44" dur="6.22">they don&amp;#39;t want them to leave they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="248.42" dur="5.97">they can&amp;#39;t allow it can you imagine if</text>
  <text start="251.66" dur="6.75">the UK set up free trade deals with many</text>
  <text start="254.39" dur="7.68">countries and the UK prospered that</text>
  <text start="258.41" dur="6.21">would be awful for the EU now Trump he</text>
  <text start="262.07" dur="5.94">is promising and he spoke to Boris</text>
  <text start="264.62" dur="6.74">Johnson on the sidelines in the g7 and</text>

  <text start="291.11" dur="3.18">that was set up the globalist trade</text>
  <text start="293" dur="4.53">deals and everything that they put into</text>
  <text start="294.29" dur="5.94">place it is now being ripped apart</text>
  <text start="297.53" dur="5.04">their economic structure is being ripped</text>
  <text start="300.23" dur="4.59">apart this is why they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="302.57" dur="3.99">writing these hit pieces against Trump</text>
  <text start="304.82" dur="3.3">letting everyone know he has no idea</text>

  <text start="438.14" dur="7.41">to be lopsided giving China the benefit</text>
  <text start="442.13" dur="6.87">this is all being done on purpose Trump</text>
  <text start="445.55" dur="5.52">is now reversing all of this now on</text>
  <text start="449" dur="3.78">Friday Trump tweeted out that the</text>
  <text start="451.07" dur="4.95">company should think about leaving China</text>
  <text start="452.78" dur="4.74">and maybe moving out of China into</text>
  <text start="456.02" dur="5.25">another country or coming back to the</text>

  <text start="461.27" dur="4.11">could order these companies to do this</text>
  <text start="463.91" dur="4.17">now the mainstream media they went crazy</text>

  <text start="468.08" dur="5.76">cannot order this he needs Congress he</text>
  <text start="470.9" dur="5.52">can&amp;#39;t just go ahead and do this and this</text>
  <text start="473.84" dur="4.74">is from CNN Trump claims he has the</text>
  <text start="476.42" dur="6.36">absolute right to order US companies out</text>
  <text start="478.58" dur="7.08">of China under 1977 law and when we look</text>
  <text start="482.78" dur="6.12">at this we can see that Trump he is out</text>
  <text start="485.66" dur="7.14">there letting everyone know he has the</text>
  <text start="488.9" dur="6.72">ability to do this it&amp;#39;s written into the</text>
  <text start="492.8" dur="5.76">law he doesn&amp;#39;t just say things to say it</text>
  <text start="495.62" dur="5.4">if he&amp;#39;s going to say something he always</text>
  <text start="498.56" dur="4.02">has something to back it up he tweeted</text>
  <text start="501.02" dur="4.02">out the following and he responded to</text>
  <text start="502.58" dur="4.2">the mainstream media for all of the fake</text>
  <text start="505.04" dur="4.29">news reporters that don&amp;#39;t have a clue as</text>
  <text start="506.78" dur="5.67">to what the law is relative to</text>
  <text start="509.33" dur="5.28">presidential powers China etc try</text>
  <text start="512.45" dur="6.41">looking at the emergency economic Powers</text>
  <text start="514.61" dur="8.22">Act of 1977 case closed</text>
  <text start="518.86" dur="6.79">now Reuters they have confirmed that yes</text>
  <text start="522.83" dur="4.2">he does have the authority even if all</text>
  <text start="525.65" dur="3.96">the mainstream media and everyone else</text>
  <text start="527.03" dur="5.46">is saying otherwise he does have the</text>
  <text start="529.61" dur="5.91">authority to do this he could treat</text>
  <text start="532.49" dur="5.25">China more like Iran and order sanctions</text>
  <text start="535.52" dur="5.37">which would involve declaring a national</text>
  <text start="537.74" dur="4.77">emergency under a 1977 law called the</text>
  <text start="540.89" dur="5.1">international emergency economic Powers</text>
  <text start="542.51" dur="5.61">Act once an emergency is declared the</text>
  <text start="545.99" dur="3.57">law gives Trump broad authority to block</text>
  <text start="548.12" dur="4.89">the activities of individual companies</text>
  <text start="549.56" dur="4.14">or even entire economic sectors and this</text>
  <text start="553.01" dur="3.33">is coming from</text>
  <text start="553.7" dur="3">legal experts and everyone else that</text>
  <text start="556.34" dur="2.82">under</text>
  <text start="556.7" dur="4.41">stands the law for example by stating</text>
  <text start="559.16" dur="3.84">that Chinese debt of US companies</text>
  <text start="561.11" dur="4.23">intellectual property constitutes a</text>
  <text start="563" dur="4.17">national emergency Trump could order US</text>
  <text start="565.34" dur="3.9">companies to avoid certain transactions</text>
  <text start="567.17" dur="3.87">such as buying Chinese technology</text>
  <text start="569.24" dur="4.74">products and we need to understand is</text>
  <text start="571.04" dur="4.47">that he used a similar strategy earlier</text>
  <text start="573.98" dur="4.5">this year when he said illegal</text>
  <text start="575.51" dur="5.55">immigrants was an emergency it was a</text>
  <text start="578.48" dur="4.28">national security threat and he</text>
  <text start="581.06" dur="4.38">threatened to put tariffs on all</text>
  <text start="582.76" dur="4.42">American imports and if there is a</text>
  <text start="585.44" dur="2.64">country out there that is a national</text>
  <text start="587.18" dur="3.57">security threat</text>
  <text start="588.08" dur="5.37">Trump has the ability to use it now do I</text>
  <text start="590.75" dur="6.57">think he&amp;#39;s going to use this most likely</text>
  <text start="593.45" dur="5.85">he&amp;#39;s going to not use it right now maybe</text>
  <text start="597.32" dur="5.67">a little bit later but he&amp;#39;s letting</text>
  <text start="599.3" dur="6.81">everyone know that he has the ability to</text>
  <text start="602.99" dur="4.83">do this and of course he wants the</text>
  <text start="606.11" dur="4.47">mainstream media to counter this and</text>
  <text start="607.82" dur="4.83">tell people no I don&amp;#39;t have the ability</text>
  <text start="610.58" dur="6.12">to do this and he comes back and says</text>
  <text start="612.65" dur="6.54">yes I do and he shows him the law and he</text>
  <text start="616.7" dur="4.68">says this is what I can do now of course</text>
