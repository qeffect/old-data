  <text start="117.85" dur="8.34">those who create currency their main</text>
  <text start="122.17" dur="5.789">objective is to control the creation of</text>

  <text start="127.959" dur="6.181">title he who controls the creation of</text>
  <text start="131.26" dur="4.65">currency controls the world because</text>
  <text start="134.14" dur="4.86">let&amp;#39;s just think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="135.91" dur="6.24">if you can create currency loan it out</text>
  <text start="139" dur="6.39">to any government in the world put them</text>
  <text start="142.15" dur="7.169">into debt put the people into debt who</text>
  <text start="145.39" dur="6.63">is the master every one reports to the</text>
  <text start="149.319" dur="5.761">central bank everyone has to do what the</text>
  <text start="152.02" dur="6.27">central bank wants the central bank can</text>
  <text start="155.08" dur="6.78">force people into doing anything because</text>
  <text start="158.29" dur="7.62">you are in debt and they hold this over</text>
  <text start="161.86" dur="6.209">you they make the people suffer by using</text>
  <text start="165.91" dur="5.61">austerity forcing the government to</text>
  <text start="168.069" dur="5.191">place austerity measures to cut back to</text>
  <text start="171.52" dur="4.77">make it difficult because their system</text>
  <text start="173.26" dur="6.12">really doesn&amp;#39;t work because as you place</text>
  <text start="176.29" dur="5.729">more and more debt on society the debt</text>
  <text start="179.38" dur="7.02">can&amp;#39;t be repaid it can&amp;#39;t be sustained</text>
  <text start="182.019" dur="8.661">and what they&amp;#39;re most nervous of is a</text>
  <text start="186.4" dur="7.649">currency that is created outside of them</text>
  <text start="190.68" dur="7.21">that would be gold and silver that would</text>
  <text start="194.049" dur="7.77">be cryptocurrency and if they see anyone</text>
  <text start="197.89" dur="8.069">trying to use this and try trying to</text>
  <text start="201.819" dur="5.821">override their system they lash out now</text>
  <text start="205.959" dur="5.101">do they come out and say oh we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="207.64" dur="6.179">get you know what they do is they force</text>
  <text start="211.06" dur="7.08">governments to create laws what they do</text>
  <text start="213.819" dur="5.691">is they try to control that currency</text>
  <text start="218.14" dur="5.069">they&amp;#39;ve done this with gold and silver</text>
  <text start="219.51" dur="5.53">where they use paper contracts to</text>
  <text start="223.209" dur="3.631">manipulate gold and silver where they</text>
  <text start="225.04" dur="3.569">suppress the price so when people look</text>
  <text start="226.84" dur="3.84">at this they say oh it&amp;#39;s better to hold</text>
  <text start="228.609" dur="3.511">the dollar than it is to hold gold and</text>
  <text start="230.68" dur="3.479">so we&amp;#39;re because you look gold and</text>
  <text start="232.12" dur="5.839">silver and other precious metals they</text>
  <text start="234.159" dur="7.17">keep going down the same thing is</text>
  <text start="237.959" dur="6.79">happening with the cryptocurrency market</text>
  <text start="241.329" dur="6.3">but right now they don&amp;#39;t have full</text>
  <text start="244.749" dur="5.52">control what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is</text>
  <text start="247.629" dur="4.801">they&amp;#39;re trying to show that crypto</text>
  <text start="250.269" dur="5.22">currencies crypto currencies are very</text>
  <text start="252.43" dur="5.04">volatile because what central banks like</text>
  <text start="255.489" dur="4.5">to do is they like to make everyone feel</text>
  <text start="257.47" dur="6.3">good make everyone think that whatever</text>
  <text start="259.989" dur="8.521">is happening is all natural and then</text>
  <text start="263.77" dur="6.66">they make that system completely implode</text>
  <text start="268.51" dur="4.32">on itself and then they go to</text>
  <text start="270.43" dur="4.26">governments and they say listen look</text>
  <text start="272.83" dur="4.14">what happened here we&amp;#39;re not in control</text>
  <text start="274.69" dur="5.28">we need some laws passed here this is</text>
  <text start="276.97" dur="5.34">really unsafe for the public and where</text>
  <text start="279.97" dur="4.83">you need to control what is happening</text>
  <text start="282.31" dur="3.78">and I see this happening with the crypto</text>
  <text start="284.8" dur="3.75">market right now because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="286.09" dur="5.64">seeing is that they created a futures</text>
  <text start="288.55" dur="4.49">market and now it looks like the New</text>
  <text start="291.73" dur="5.61">York Stock Exchange</text>
  <text start="293.04" dur="6.7">files for leverage inverse Bitcoin ETFs</text>
  <text start="297.34" dur="4.5">and again what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is</text>
  <text start="299.74" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re trying to control us now the New</text>
  <text start="301.84" dur="6.24">York Stock Exchange has asked the SEC to</text>
  <text start="304.96" dur="5.94">approve five ETFs including two times</text>
  <text start="308.08" dur="5.22">leverage and inverse flavors linked to</text>
  <text start="310.9" dur="4.829">Bitcoin futures which was launched in</text>
  <text start="313.3" dur="3.57">December and they&amp;#39;ll be Derk five</text>
  <text start="315.729" dur="4.741">derivative funds</text>
  <text start="316.87" dur="5.1">now the target Bitcoin benchmark will be</text>
  <text start="320.47" dur="4.68">calculated as the last sale price</text>
  <text start="321.97" dur="4.979">published by the CME or CBOE on or</text>
  <text start="325.15" dur="5.519">before 11:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time</text>
  <text start="326.949" dur="5.94">and should not be expected to track the</text>
  <text start="330.669" dur="3.691">performance of the target benchmark for</text>
  <text start="332.889" dur="4.5">any period longer than 1 business day</text>
  <text start="334.36" dur="5.55">now of course as the filing explicitly</text>
  <text start="337.389" dur="5.431">warns the funds are not intended for</text>
  <text start="339.91" dur="5.33">long term investing which means everyone</text>
  <text start="342.82" dur="4.8">needs to hang on to their hats because</text>
  <text start="345.24" dur="4.6">Bitcoin right now how it&amp;#39;s so volatile</text>
  <text start="347.62" dur="4.35">moving up and down it&amp;#39;s going to become</text>
  <text start="349.84" dur="4.56">even more volatile and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="351.97" dur="5.61">what they want now very interestingly</text>
  <text start="354.4" dur="6.45">out in Europe people were using Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="357.58" dur="5.399">debit cards and basically they are they</text>
  <text start="360.85" dur="4.08">put cryptocurrencies on the debit cards</text>
  <text start="362.979" dur="5.281">and they go out and they use them to pay</text>
  <text start="364.93" dur="5.91">for things and it looks like the Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="368.26" dur="5">debit cards they stopped working after a</text>
  <text start="370.84" dur="5.4">decision from the payment processor and</text>
  <text start="373.26" dur="4.75">this happened on Friday now several of</text>
  <text start="376.24" dur="4.739">the most popular Bitcoin debit cards</text>
  <text start="378.01" dur="5.64">which are basically prepaid cards topped</text>
  <text start="380.979" dur="4.731">up with cryptocurrency they stopped</text>
  <text start="383.65" dur="5.4">working in Europe after Visa Europe</text>
  <text start="385.71" dur="6.429">terminated services for wave crest a</text>
  <text start="389.05" dur="5.489">prepaid card issuer now the prepaid</text>
  <text start="392.139" dur="4.201">cards are an important way for people to</text>
  <text start="394.539" dur="3.241">use Bitcoin to pay for things even if</text>
  <text start="396.34" dur="2.94">the retailer doesn&amp;#39;t accept</text>
  <text start="397.78" dur="3.42">cryptocurrency they put the</text>
  <text start="399.28" dur="4.08">cryptocurrency on the prepaid and they</text>
  <text start="401.2" dur="5.25">were able to use this to pay for</text>
  <text start="403.36" dur="5.16">whatever they&amp;#39;re purchasing now after</text>
  <text start="406.45" dur="4.469">visas Europe decision regarding wave</text>
  <text start="408.52" dur="5.43">crest and Friday Bitcoin debit card</text>
  <text start="410.919" dur="4.261">companies bit wallet bit pay crypto pay</text>
  <text start="413.95" dur="3.51">and others announced on Twitter that</text>
  <text start="415.18" dur="5.489">cards in Europe would stop working</text>
  <text start="417.46" dur="5.25">effective immediately and the customer</text>
  <text start="420.669" dur="5.191">funds will be returned now it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="422.71" dur="5.1">unclear at this time why visa terminated</text>
  <text start="425.86" dur="2.97">wave crest services now one of the</text>
  <text start="427.81" dur="2.7">reasons they&amp;#39;re saying is that they</text>
  <text start="428.83" dur="3.959">weren&amp;#39;t in compliance with our</text>
  <text start="430.51" dur="3.3">membership regulations and I think what</text>
  <text start="432.789" dur="4.681">they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="433.81" dur="5.49">shutting this down so nobody uses crypto</text>
  <text start="437.47" dur="3.84">currencies to pay for anything and it</text>
  <text start="439.3" dur="4.95">looks like this was a way around paying</text>
  <text start="441.31" dur="6.09">for things not using the central bank</text>
  <text start="444.25" dur="5.849">system and it looks like they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="447.4" dur="3.43">this now again we understand the central</text>
  <text start="450.099" dur="4.091">bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="450.83" dur="5.519">the name of the game is control remember</text>
  <text start="454.19" dur="4.979">China is still part of that central bank</text>
  <text start="456.349" dur="4.53">system the central bank is looking to</text>
  <text start="459.169" dur="5.21">move everything from the west to the</text>
  <text start="460.879" dur="7.651">east and we see already that there is a</text>
  <text start="464.379" dur="6.85">petrol u1 which is going live in January</text>
  <text start="468.53" dur="5.099">it looks like the RMB is going to be</text>
  <text start="471.229" dur="4.981">pushed for cross-border trade or</text>
  <text start="473.629" dur="5.371">cross-border use because the People&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="476.21" dur="4.949">Bank of China said that it encouraged</text>
  <text start="479" dur="5.28">cross-border and overseas use of the</text>
  <text start="481.159" dur="6.421">remember the RMB to settle accounts and</text>
  <text start="484.28" dur="5.34">boost investment and they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="487.58" dur="6.149">this because they understand they need</text>
  <text start="489.62" dur="7.44">to allow foreign investors to use this</text>
  <text start="493.729" dur="5.611">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="497.06" dur="4.53">coming out of the International payment</text>
  <text start="499.34" dur="4.71">infrastructure company Swift it reported</text>
  <text start="501.59" dur="5.25">that the R&amp;amp;B star passed the Swiss franc</text>
  <text start="504.05" dur="5.79">and the Canadian dollar as a six month</text>
  <text start="506.84" dur="5.129">most used currency in November and I</text>
  <text start="509.84" dur="4.86">believe that the RMB is going to move</text>
  <text start="511.969" dur="6.151">even further up the chain here because</text>
  <text start="514.7" dur="6">their whole plan is to get the world to</text>
  <text start="518.12" dur="5.43">use this country&amp;#39;s I should say I think</text>
  <text start="520.7" dur="4.199">on a lower level the central banks are</text>
  <text start="523.55" dur="3.87">going to use cryptocurrencies because</text>
  <text start="524.899" dur="4.44">this will be a system where there will</text>
  <text start="527.42" dur="3.84">be no cash but again we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="529.339" dur="4.081">be using Bitcoin I think their plan is</text>
  <text start="531.26" dur="3.66">to have us use one of their coins that</text>
  <text start="533.42" dur="3.659">they&amp;#39;re creating and already we</text>
  <text start="534.92" dur="3.109">understand that they have coins waiting</text>
  <text start="537.079" dur="4.111">in the wings</text>
  <text start="538.029" dur="5.981">now we see that things are really</text>
  <text start="541.19" dur="5.399">falling apart and it&amp;#39;s starting to look</text>
  <text start="544.01" dur="4.56">bad for the Cabal the Department of</text>

  <text start="688.339" dur="4.951">jets had approached the su-30 fighter</text>
  <text start="691.04" dur="5.82">jets in two separate incidents on</text>
  <text start="693.29" dur="6.09">November 23rd and a7 December 13th near</text>
  <text start="696.86" dur="5.28">the Baltics now the route of the Russian</text>
  <text start="699.38" dur="5.43">fighter jets was agreed with the air</text>
  <text start="702.14" dur="4.5">logistic control units and was carried</text>
  <text start="704.81" dur="4.02">out in strict compliance with the</text>
  <text start="706.64" dur="4.53">international rules in both instances</text>
  <text start="708.83" dur="4.41">the f-15 fighters approach that safe</text>
  <text start="711.17" dur="5.01">distance after which they changed course</text>
  <text start="713.24" dur="5.46">and flew away now of course they want</text>
  <text start="716.18" dur="4.8">everyone to believe that</text>
  <text start="718.7" dur="4.5">my god look the two Jets came very close</text>
  <text start="720.98" dur="4.56">to each other this is Russia provoking</text>
  <text start="723.2" dur="3.5">and trying to start something that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="725.54" dur="4.2">what&amp;#39;s happening here</text>
  <text start="726.7" dur="5.32">we&amp;#39;ve proved this time and time again</text>
  <text start="729.74" dur="5.01">but this is what the Cabal the corporate</text>
  <text start="732.02" dur="3.5">media NATO this is what they want you to</text>
  <text start="734.75" dur="3.27">believe</text>
  <text start="735.52" dur="4.54">just like with North Korea they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="738.02" dur="3.66">trying to make you believe that Kim</text>
  <text start="740.06" dur="3.87">jong-un was going to fire his missiles</text>
  <text start="741.68" dur="4.11">these missiles with nuclear warheads on</text>
  <text start="743.93" dur="3.39">top of them were able to reach the</text>
  <text start="745.79" dur="3.39">United States which we know is</text>
  <text start="747.32" dur="4.41">completely fake phony and false because</text>
  <text start="749.18" dur="4.95">we know they break apart before they</text>
  <text start="751.73" dur="6.33">even hit their target and they&amp;#39;ve only</text>
  <text start="754.13" dur="7.71">flown as far as Japan and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="758.06" dur="6.6">even keep their missiles intact so we</text>
  <text start="761.84" dur="3.96">know that this is an impossibility right</text>
  <text start="764.66" dur="3.81">now but they&amp;#39;re trying to build this up</text>
  <text start="765.8" dur="5.01">and we know behind the scenes there are</text>
  <text start="768.47" dur="3.99">talks for peace this is why there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="770.81" dur="3.81">drills happening during the Olympics</text>
  <text start="772.46" dur="3.93">this is not what the Cabal wants this is</text>
  <text start="774.62" dur="5.19">why we see the South talking to the</text>
  <text start="776.39" dur="5.01">north this is why Tillerson basically</text>
  <text start="779.81" dur="4.26">came out and said hey it would be great</text>
  <text start="781.4" dur="4.83">if both sides can speak and we&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="784.07" dur="5.82">talks in the background and this was</text>
  <text start="786.23" dur="6.66">feelers to see what how and how everyone</text>
  <text start="789.89" dur="5.52">would react to this and we see right now</text>
  <text start="792.89" dur="3.96">that this plan is moving forward</text>
  <text start="795.41" dur="4.38">actually Trump is out there saying</text>
  <text start="796.85" dur="5.4">listen he&amp;#39;s willing to talk to Kim</text>
  <text start="799.79" dur="5.13">jong-un as long as he meets certain</text>
  <text start="802.25" dur="4.71">conditions now again this is the part</text>
  <text start="804.92" dur="3.72">where everyone&amp;#39;s going to take this and</text>
  <text start="806.96" dur="3.78">you know say oh see there&amp;#39;s conditions</text>
  <text start="808.64" dur="4.85">know what they&amp;#39;re doing it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="810.74" dur="6.12">introducing this very very slowly and</text>
  <text start="813.49" dur="4.74">you can see right now that Kim jong-un</text>
  <text start="816.86" dur="4.29">is in a comfortable position</text>
  <text start="818.23" dur="5.38">Russia and China is backing this the</text>
  <text start="821.15" dur="4.2">United States is now being pulled into</text>
  <text start="823.61" dur="4.79">this and it&amp;#39;s showing like okay look</text>
  <text start="825.35" dur="7.71">they made their first step South Korea</text>
  <text start="828.4" dur="7.12">did phase one they said we would like to</text>
  <text start="833.06" dur="4.83">speak to North Korea we would like to</text>
  <text start="835.52" dur="4.83">have no drills during this period of</text>
  <text start="837.89" dur="5.43">time during the Olympics the United</text>
  <text start="840.35" dur="6.09">States said okay we will do this the</text>
  <text start="843.32" dur="4.32">hotlines were opened they had an initial</text>
  <text start="846.44" dur="4.32">conversation they&amp;#39;re going to be talking</text>
  <text start="847.64" dur="4.32">on the 9th and now we see China and</text>
  <text start="850.76" dur="4.019">Russia</text>
  <text start="851.96" dur="4.62">the invitation to the United States so</text>
  <text start="854.779" dur="4.291">you can see how this is all being played</text>
  <text start="856.58" dur="4.74">out now Trump is already saying yes we</text>
  <text start="859.07" dur="4.079">are willing to speak even though he</text>
  <text start="861.32" dur="5.76">talked about you know our nukes are</text>
  <text start="863.149" dur="7.581">bigger than yours this was all words for</text>
  <text start="867.08" dur="6.42">the corporate media to make them believe</text>
  <text start="870.73" dur="4.72">that we had this strong stance that we</text>
  <text start="873.5" dur="3.87">would go to war in a minute because this</text>
  <text start="875.45" dur="5.16">is what the neocons the Cabal this is</text>
  <text start="877.37" dur="7.71">what they love and now it&amp;#39;s falling</text>
  <text start="880.61" dur="7.83">apart we also see out in Libya the</text>
  <text start="885.08" dur="6.42">Libyan Parliament speaker well it looks</text>
  <text start="888.44" dur="6.269">like they are inviting Russia in to have</text>
  <text start="891.5" dur="6.42">peace talks Russia is going to be</text>
  <text start="894.709" dur="5.911">working in reconciliation Foreign</text>
  <text start="897.92" dur="4.74">Minister Sergei Lavrov was among the</text>
  <text start="900.62" dur="4.29">first backers of the need to amend the</text>
  <text start="902.66" dur="5.25">political agreement and he&amp;#39;s in there</text>
  <text start="904.91" dur="7.14">and he&amp;#39;s going to be making deals to</text>
  <text start="907.91" dur="6.9">calm the entire situation down in Libya</text>
  <text start="912.05" dur="5.7">and probably establish new government</text>
  <text start="914.81" dur="4.86">have elections and most likely that UN</text>
  <text start="917.75" dur="4.529">backed government which their time is up</text>
  <text start="919.67" dur="5.64">will be thrown out of there we see in</text>
  <text start="922.279" dur="6.18">Iran that whole protests that was</text>
  <text start="925.31" dur="4.86">completely made up by the US where they</text>
  <text start="928.459" dur="3.481">said people were protesting for freedom</text>
  <text start="930.17" dur="3.32">and democracy no they&amp;#39;re protesting</text>
  <text start="931.94" dur="3.66">because of their economic situation</text>
  <text start="933.49" dur="4.33">where there were certain austerity</text>

  <text start="960.38" dur="5.22">they shut it all down and we can see</text>
  <text start="963.35" dur="3.54">right now Iran&amp;#39;s Revolutionary Guard has</text>
  <text start="965.6" dur="4.19">announced that the government forces</text>
  <text start="966.89" dur="6.389">have broken down the chain of unrest</text>
  <text start="969.79" dur="6.37">which was not their own people this was</text>
  <text start="973.279" dur="7.081">foreign individuals that were brought</text>
  <text start="976.16" dur="7.11">into the country and we see already that</text>
  <text start="980.36" dur="5.349">this whole protest thing it&amp;#39;s said and</text>
  <text start="983.27" dur="3.999">done it&amp;#39;s all over with it&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="985.709" dur="2.82">even though the United States the</text>
  <text start="987.269" dur="3.031">corporate media and everyone else was</text>
  <text start="988.529" dur="5.191">out there saying that this is a fight</text>
  <text start="990.3" dur="5.219">for freedom which it never was we see</text>
  <text start="993.72" dur="3.27">the free syrian army commanders there</text>

  <text start="1025.73" dur="3.78">Syria which is three times the size of</text>
  <text start="1027.47" dur="5.79">Lebanon now this sounds like propaganda</text>
  <text start="1029.51" dur="7.62">to me because once again Syria is a</text>
  <text start="1033.26" dur="6.48">sovereign country it&amp;#39;s funny the US will</text>
  <text start="1037.13" dur="6.709">recognize the Kurdish area but will not</text>
  <text start="1039.74" dur="7.469">recognize the Catalonia area in Spain</text>
  <text start="1043.839" dur="7.181">it&amp;#39;s very interesting how this is being</text>
  <text start="1047.209" dur="5.251">played here and once again Syria is a</text>
  <text start="1051.02" dur="4.409">sovereign nation the United States has</text>
  <text start="1052.46" dur="5.939">no rights to be in Syria the United</text>
  <text start="1055.429" dur="5.701">States has no right to even set up bases</text>

  <text start="1061.13" dur="3.779">people they were not invited into the</text>
  <text start="1063.71" dur="4.11">country so we&amp;#39;re gonna have to see how</text>
  <text start="1064.909" dur="7.14">that plays out but this was part of the</text>
  <text start="1067.82" dur="8.55">cabal&amp;#39;s plan it was to split up the</text>
  <text start="1072.049" dur="8.01">Middle East Kurdish area XI I re a Sunni</text>
  <text start="1076.37" dur="5.73">area Alawite area and it looks like</text>
  <text start="1080.059" dur="4.201">they&amp;#39;re still trying to push this goal</text>
  <text start="1082.1" dur="3.99">and they&amp;#39;re still putting stories out</text>
  <text start="1084.26" dur="5.01">about this but we&amp;#39;ll have to see how</text>
