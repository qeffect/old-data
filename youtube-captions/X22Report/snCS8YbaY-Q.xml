  <text start="93.91" dur="4.68">financial news now over the years we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="96.28" dur="4.08">been looking at the economy and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="98.59" dur="4.559">been watching it deteriorate day after</text>
  <text start="100.36" dur="4.11">day now during Obama&amp;#39;s presidency he was</text>
  <text start="103.149" dur="4.531">out there telling us that this is how</text>
  <text start="104.47" dur="4.41">the recovery is we know that the BLS and</text>
  <text start="107.68" dur="3.689">the rest of the agencies have been</text>
  <text start="108.88" dur="3.659">manipulating a lot of these numbers we</text>
  <text start="111.369" dur="3.75">started to realize that the unemployment</text>
  <text start="112.539" dur="4.201">number made no sense whatsoever other</text>
  <text start="115.119" dur="3.81">individuals started to jump on board</text>
  <text start="116.74" dur="3.81">where they were outspoken thing yet</text>
  <text start="118.929" dur="3.631">these numbers make no sense whatsoever</text>
  <text start="120.55" dur="3.629">and then we sort of look at what was</text>
  <text start="122.56" dur="4.64">really going on in the economy with</text>
  <text start="124.179" dur="6.03">housing with retail GDP manufacturing</text>
  <text start="127.2" dur="4.75">restaurants and everything else and we</text>
  <text start="130.209" dur="4.89">notice that the economy is actually</text>
  <text start="131.95" dur="5.55">contracting on itself not expanding</text>
  <text start="135.099" dur="7.081">during a recovery during the good times</text>
  <text start="137.5" dur="8.48">in an economy the economy expands it</text>
  <text start="142.18" dur="7.919">grows people get better paying jobs</text>
  <text start="145.98" dur="6.19">retail expands more stores open but</text>
  <text start="150.099" dur="4.291">we&amp;#39;re seeing the opposite right now and</text>
  <text start="152.17" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re starting to see these bubbles</text>
  <text start="154.39" dur="4.11">start to pop and everything that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="156.61" dur="3.78">been talking about corporate defaults</text>
  <text start="158.5" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about how the market</text>
  <text start="160.39" dur="4.17">has been rigged how precious metals has</text>
  <text start="162.94" dur="3.42">been written that&amp;#39;s been proven because</text>
  <text start="164.56" dur="5.34">of the investigation and lawsuits</text>
  <text start="166.36" dur="5.28">against certain banks we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="169.9" dur="5.64">see that all of this is starting to come</text>
  <text start="171.64" dur="5.25">down around the manipulation and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="175.54" dur="4.53">starting to see that the economy is</text>
  <text start="176.89" dur="4.03">starting to implode on itself I mean</text>
  <text start="180.07" dur="2.8">just look</text>
  <text start="180.92" dur="3.929">retail right now now i remember when i</text>
  <text start="182.87" dur="3.72">started reporting on retail on how each</text>
  <text start="184.849" dur="3.451">holiday season they were getting worse</text>
  <text start="186.59" dur="3.41">and worse as time went on and it made no</text>
  <text start="188.3" dur="5.1">sense because if unemployment is</text>
  <text start="190" dur="4.69">dropping from ten percent to nine</text>
  <text start="193.4" dur="2.699">percent and of course these are the</text>
  <text start="194.69" dur="2.91">manipulating numbers that the government</text>
  <text start="196.099" dur="4.47">put out there but we&amp;#39;ll go with those</text>
  <text start="197.6" dur="5.04">numbers and it kept falling during the</text>
  <text start="200.569" dur="5.191">time period and more people were getting</text>
  <text start="202.64" dur="5.4">jobs why was retail contracting at the</text>
  <text start="205.76" dur="4.979">same rate it makes no sense whatsoever</text>
  <text start="208.04" dur="5.52">then we started to realize ah they</text>
  <text start="210.739" dur="4.411">manipulated the unemployment rate those</text>
  <text start="213.56" dur="3.36">people who have fallen off we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="215.15" dur="3.6">been on an interview for four weeks they</text>
  <text start="216.92" dur="3.39">just don&amp;#39;t count them anymore they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="218.75" dur="2.819">given up they don&amp;#39;t want to make a</text>
  <text start="220.31" dur="2.73">living they don&amp;#39;t want to make money for</text>
  <text start="221.569" dur="2.67">their family they don&amp;#39;t want to go on</text>
  <text start="223.04" dur="3.99">vacations they don&amp;#39;t want to buy things</text>
  <text start="224.239" dur="4.681">in retail yeah that makes real a lot of</text>
  <text start="227.03" dur="4.5">sense doesn&amp;#39;t it no what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="228.92" dur="4.71">happening here is they had to keep the</text>
  <text start="231.53" dur="3.81">illusion alive and ahead of explain away</text>
  <text start="233.63" dur="4.139">why all this was happening now they</text>
  <text start="235.34" dur="4.41">started out with the weather this is why</text>
  <text start="237.769" dur="4.381">retail is not doing well during the</text>
  <text start="239.75" dur="4.56">holiday season during the spring during</text>
  <text start="242.15" dur="4.649">the summer and that kind of fell apart</text>
  <text start="244.31" dur="4.44">because how many times can you use it</text>
  <text start="246.799" dur="5.961">when retail continually falls apart and</text>
  <text start="248.75" dur="6.39">what we&amp;#39;re seeing today is that it is</text>
  <text start="252.76" dur="4.36">accelerating at a pace that we&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="255.14" dur="3.39">ever seen before and by the way all</text>
  <text start="257.12" dur="5.01">those people because i weld all of</text>
  <text start="258.53" dur="7.23">luring sales no it&amp;#39;s not all of these</text>
  <text start="262.13" dur="6.84">businesses have an online presence and</text>
  <text start="265.76" dur="6.81">online sales makes one tenth of retail</text>
  <text start="268.97" dur="5.55">sales that&amp;#39;s it yes the corporate media</text>
  <text start="272.57" dur="4.17">can throw out three billion here two</text>
  <text start="274.52" dur="4.709">billion online sales but it&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="276.74" dur="5.58">hundreds and hundreds of billions for</text>
  <text start="279.229" dur="6.031">retail sales so online sales is a very</text>
  <text start="282.32" dur="6.42">small part of it right now and we can</text>
  <text start="285.26" dur="6.54">see from these huge stores like fears</text>
  <text start="288.74" dur="5.9">well they&amp;#39;re rapidly deteriorating</text>
  <text start="291.8" dur="5.97">falling apart right now it looks like</text>
  <text start="294.64" dur="5.71">Sears is going to be cutting senior</text>
  <text start="297.77" dur="5.399">management positions they&amp;#39;re closing 92</text>
  <text start="300.35" dur="5.64">pharmacies and kmart stores 50 sears</text>
  <text start="303.169" dur="5.101">auto centers and once this starts to</text>
  <text start="305.99" dur="5.429">happen you know what happens to stores</text>
  <text start="308.27" dur="5.04">they completely fall apart we know in</text>
  <text start="311.419" dur="3.361">the beginning of 2017 there was going to</text>
  <text start="313.31" dur="4.53">be about 3500 store</text>
  <text start="314.78" dur="5.67">that would be closing well that number</text>
  <text start="317.84" dur="5.97">has now jumped much much higher actually</text>
  <text start="320.45" dur="7.02">credit Swiss they&amp;#39;re saying that barely</text>
  <text start="323.81" dur="5.22">a quarter into 2017 year-to-date retail</text>
  <text start="327.47" dur="6.54">store closings have already surpassed</text>
  <text start="329.03" dur="8.01">those of 2008 well that&amp;#39;s an incredible</text>
  <text start="334.01" dur="5.54">recovery according to credit Swiss and</text>
  <text start="337.04" dur="4.32">their calculations on a unit basis</text>
  <text start="339.55" dur="3.4">approximately two thousand eight hundred</text>
  <text start="341.36" dur="3.72">eighty store closings were announced</text>
  <text start="342.95" dur="5.94">year-to-date more than twice as many</text>
  <text start="345.08" dur="6.06">closings as a 1153 announced during the</text>
  <text start="348.89" dur="4.32">same period last year historically</text>
  <text start="351.14" dur="4.05">roughly sixty percent of store closure</text>
  <text start="353.21" dur="4.38">announcements occur in the first five</text>
  <text start="355.19" dur="4.53">months of the year by extrapolating the</text>
  <text start="357.59" dur="6.17">year-to-date announcements credit Swiss</text>
  <text start="359.72" dur="7.14">estimates that there could be more than</text>
  <text start="363.76" dur="5.65">8640 store closings this year which will</text>
  <text start="366.86" dur="6.21">be higher than the historical 2008 peak</text>
  <text start="369.41" dur="5.759">of approximately 6200 store closings</text>
  <text start="373.07" dur="5.63">which suggests that brick and mortar</text>
  <text start="375.169" dur="7.051">stores well things are about to change</text>
  <text start="378.7" dur="5.71">quite a bit and it shows us that things</text>
  <text start="382.22" dur="3.81">are rapidly changing and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="384.41" dur="3.66">accelerating and it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="386.03" dur="4.68">domino effect basically the retail</text>
  <text start="388.07" dur="4.95">bubble has popped that&amp;#39;s what this is</text>
  <text start="390.71" dur="5.91">telling us actually 10 retailers</text>
  <text start="393.02" dur="6.39">including like limited hhgregg Sporting</text>
  <text start="396.62" dur="5.19">Goods chain gander mountain and many</text>
  <text start="399.41" dur="4.62">others they&amp;#39;ve already filed bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="401.81" dur="5.07">already and this compares with nine</text>
  <text start="404.03" dur="4.74">retailers that declare bankruptcies with</text>
  <text start="406.88" dur="5.159">at least 50 million liabilities for all</text>
  <text start="408.77" dur="4.89">of 2016 we know that bebe stores on</text>
  <text start="412.039" dur="3.241">friday announced that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="413.66" dur="3.87">be closing the remaining a hundred and</text>
  <text start="415.28" dur="6.06">seventy shops and they&amp;#39;re just going to</text>
  <text start="417.53" dur="6.63">move everything and try to survive with</text>
  <text start="421.34" dur="5.76">online sales now online sales that does</text>
  <text start="424.16" dur="4.86">not handle most of their sales so we can</text>
  <text start="427.1" dur="3.6">see what&amp;#39;s going to happen here they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="429.02" dur="3.149">closing all their stores they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="430.7" dur="4.17">to depend on online sales for a little</text>
  <text start="432.169" dur="4.921">while and then their online sales that</text>
  <text start="434.87" dur="4.02">is going to disappear it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="437.09" dur="4.26">be able to survive whatsoever even</text>
  <text start="438.89" dur="4.92">though people believe that online sales</text>
  <text start="441.35" dur="6.48">well that is most of the retail</text>
  <text start="443.81" dur="4.74">purchases today it is not and the worst</text>
  <text start="447.83" dur="4.14">part about</text>
  <text start="448.55" dur="7.41">all of this is that as all these stores</text>
  <text start="451.97" dur="6.87">closed what do we have we have retail</text>
  <text start="455.96" dur="6.87">space that is opening up and you have to</text>
  <text start="458.84" dur="7.32">remember how they calculate sales for</text>
  <text start="462.83" dur="5.28">retail when stores closed down they</text>
  <text start="466.16" dur="3.87">don&amp;#39;t just say okay you know what let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="468.11" dur="4.11">subtract all those sales because the</text>
  <text start="470.03" dur="4.38">stores went out of business know when</text>
  <text start="472.22" dur="4.43">the stores are closing down and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="474.41" dur="5.34">completely out of business they actually</text>
  <text start="476.65" dur="4.57">calculated out over a period of time so</text>
  <text start="479.75" dur="2.91">they might say the stores have closed</text>
  <text start="481.22" dur="3.45">today and they&amp;#39;re all out of business</text>
  <text start="482.66" dur="3.78">and the stores are empty but they will</text>
  <text start="484.67" dur="3.93">take that number and they will calculate</text>
  <text start="486.44" dur="4.95">it out over months and months and months</text>
  <text start="488.6" dur="5.04">to even out what is happening in the</text>
  <text start="491.39" dur="4.47">real economy and of course that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="493.64" dur="5.04">type of manipulation but we have</text>
  <text start="495.86" dur="5.85">millions of square feet that are going</text>
  <text start="498.68" dur="5.76">to be available actually 49 million</text>
  <text start="501.71" dur="5.58">square feet of retail space has closed</text>
  <text start="504.44" dur="5.31">year-to-date now should this pace</text>
  <text start="507.29" dur="4.08">persist by the end of the year the total</text>
  <text start="509.75" dur="3.81">square footage reductions could reach a</text>
  <text start="511.37" dur="5.04">hundred and forty seven million square</text>
  <text start="513.56" dur="5.6">feet another all-time highs are passing</text>
  <text start="516.41" dur="7.2">the historical peak of 115 million in</text>
  <text start="519.16" dur="7.63">2001 so at this point we are seeing that</text>
  <text start="523.61" dur="5.88">this retail bubble is popping the</text>
  <text start="526.79" dur="6.39">commercial real estate bubble that is</text>
  <text start="529.49" dur="6.27">going to be a complete disaster and this</text>
  <text start="533.18" dur="4.05">will have a domino effect on the rest of</text>
  <text start="535.76" dur="4.38">the economy actually when we look at</text>
  <text start="537.23" dur="4.71">this and we look at bank defaults where</text>
  <text start="540.14" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re completely insolvent we look at</text>
  <text start="541.94" dur="4.29">corporate defaults which that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="545" dur="3.48">have an effect we have the derivative</text>
  <text start="546.23" dur="3.63">bubble we have the bottom bubble we have</text>
  <text start="548.48" dur="2.85">the stock market bubble we have the</text>
  <text start="549.86" dur="3.69">retail bubble we have the commercial</text>
  <text start="551.33" dur="3.99">real estate bubble we have a housing</text>
  <text start="553.55" dur="3.93">bubble we have the auto bubble we have</text>
  <text start="555.32" dur="4.53">the student loan bubble this entire</text>
  <text start="557.48" dur="4.59">economy is one gigantic bubble and each</text>
  <text start="559.85" dur="4.26">bubble is going to start popping one</text>
  <text start="562.07" dur="4.08">after another after another and the</text>
  <text start="564.11" dur="5.3">whole thing is just going to come down</text>
  <text start="566.15" dur="6.27">now those balls that are compared are</text>
  <text start="569.41" dur="5.32">basically trying to survive right now</text>
  <text start="572.42" dur="4.2">they are doing whatever they possibly</text>
  <text start="574.73" dur="4.89">can to survive because what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="576.62" dur="5.52">is no traffic is coming into the malls</text>
  <text start="579.62" dur="2.82">and this is because people don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="582.14" dur="2.82">the</text>
  <text start="582.44" dur="5.67">funds to go out shopping either in the</text>
  <text start="584.96" dur="5.79">brick and mortar or online that is just</text>
  <text start="588.11" dur="3.93">a fact today and what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="590.75" dur="3.17">do to drive people to the brick and</text>
  <text start="592.04" dur="4.29">mortar stores and these moles that are</text>

  <text start="640.49" dur="5.52">more people jobs buying more fleets of</text>
  <text start="643.21" dur="4.3">automobiles which needs tires parts and</text>
  <text start="646.01" dur="4.08">things like that and this is why they</text>
  <text start="647.51" dur="4.41">can spike things up and show that oh</text>
  <text start="650.09" dur="3.21">look this corporation is doing better</text>
  <text start="651.92" dur="4.29">because we just bought a million tires</text>
  <text start="653.3" dur="5.04">but the thing is this is all fake phony</text>
  <text start="656.21" dur="4.14">and false because what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="658.34" dur="4.46">they&amp;#39;re boring against a credit card</text>
  <text start="660.35" dur="5.25">using that money to give people jobs</text>
  <text start="662.8" dur="5.62">using that money or should say currency</text>
  <text start="665.6" dur="5.04">to purchase goods and this is how</text>
  <text start="668.42" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;ve been keeping the economy afloat</text>
  <text start="670.64" dur="4.32">now this is going to come to an end</text>
  <text start="673.13" dur="4.17">whether we like it or not because it</text>
  <text start="674.96" dur="4.59">always does and people say no it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="677.3" dur="3.69">this will continue forever if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="679.55" dur="4.56">never been in this situation before</text>
  <text start="680.99" dur="6.84">you&amp;#39;ll don&amp;#39;t realize how things actually</text>
  <text start="684.11" dur="6.36">do come to an end it cannot go on</text>
  <text start="687.83" dur="5.7">forever because when your revenue base</text>
  <text start="690.47" dur="5.27">drops and your interest rate and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="693.53" dur="6.42">borrowing continually increases it</text>
  <text start="695.74" dur="7.78">cannot continue forever this is a proven</text>
  <text start="699.95" dur="5.76">fact it will break because if this was</text>
  <text start="703.52" dur="5.34">the case we wouldn&amp;#39;t have had all these</text>
  <text start="705.71" dur="5.07">recessions throughout the years but we</text>
  <text start="708.86" dur="3.57">know why we&amp;#39;ve had all these recessions</text>
  <text start="710.78" dur="3.9">and the depression throughout the years</text>
  <text start="712.43" dur="3.509">this has all been caused by the central</text>
  <text start="714.68" dur="4.649">bank it has been caused</text>
  <text start="715.939" dur="6.18">by those individuals who are in control</text>
  <text start="719.329" dur="5.34">they bring down the economy this is why</text>
  <text start="722.119" dur="4.86">you need us you need us to manage the</text>
  <text start="724.669" dur="4.44">the currency you need you need us to</text>
  <text start="726.979" dur="4.86">manage the economy of the government of</text>
  <text start="729.109" dur="4.32">the world and this is what we do and</text>
  <text start="731.839" dur="4.68">this is what they continually do to</text>
  <text start="733.429" dur="5.49">prove why we need the central bank to</text>
  <text start="736.519" dur="6.84">show that they have full control of what</text>
  <text start="738.919" dur="6.6">is going on here now Charles Schwab came</text>
  <text start="743.359" dur="3.99">out a few days ago with something very</text>
  <text start="745.519" dur="4.68">interesting they announced that the</text>
  <text start="747.349" dur="4.77">number of new brokerage accounts sword</text>
  <text start="750.199" dur="4.62">forty-four percent during the first</text>
  <text start="752.119" dur="4.89">quarter of 2017 now people might be</text>
  <text start="754.819" dur="3.93">looking at this saying WOW the markets</text>
  <text start="757.009" dur="4.59">doing well people are getting into it</text>
  <text start="758.749" dur="4.59">but more specifically Schwab stated that</text>
  <text start="761.599" dur="3.99">individual investors are opening up</text>
  <text start="763.339" dur="5.09">stock trading accounts at the fastest</text>
  <text start="765.589" dur="6.87">pace the company has seen in 17 years</text>
  <text start="768.429" dur="8.35">now to me when I look at this this is a</text>
  <text start="772.459" dur="8.28">classic bubble scenario the last time we</text>
  <text start="776.779" dur="7.62">saw this 17 years ago was the dot-com</text>
  <text start="780.739" dur="6.06">bubble burst and what we saw was the</text>
  <text start="784.399" dur="6.24">stock market rising very high the</text>
  <text start="786.799" dur="8.13">insiders selling off their stocks the</text>
  <text start="790.639" dur="6.84">retail investor coming in and purchasing</text>
  <text start="794.929" dur="4.89">those stocks and we are seeing the same</text>
  <text start="797.479" dur="4.41">thing actually it happens in housing to</text>
  <text start="799.819" dur="4.41">where the insiders they purchase as many</text>
  <text start="801.889" dur="4.11">houses they possibly can and then they</text>
  <text start="804.229" dur="3.12">start selling them off to retail</text>
  <text start="805.999" dur="3.63">investors because they pumped up the</text>
  <text start="807.349" dur="4.29">bubble they pump it up far enough where</text>
  <text start="809.629" dur="4.5">people think wow housing is going to</text>
  <text start="811.639" dur="5.16">continually move up there speculators</text>
  <text start="814.129" dur="3.66">the mom and pop speculator who says you</text>
  <text start="816.799" dur="2.37">know something I&amp;#39;m going to get into</text>
  <text start="817.789" dur="3.42">housing right now i&amp;#39;m going to start</text>
  <text start="819.169" dur="3.9">flipping the first couple of times it</text>
  <text start="821.209" dur="3.39">works out very very well and they</text>
  <text start="823.069" dur="3.45">continually do it they hold on to a</text>
  <text start="824.599" dur="4.02">couple of houses they expand their</text>
  <text start="826.519" dur="3.96">businesses and they purchase one two</text>
  <text start="828.619" dur="4.29">three four homes they start redoing</text>
  <text start="830.479" dur="5.01">those and then what happens is the</text>
  <text start="832.909" dur="4.86">market comes down and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="835.489" dur="5.01">see this not just in the housing but in</text>
  <text start="837.769" dur="5.57">the stock market also and if we look</text>
  <text start="840.499" dur="5.28">back going back to the dot-com bubble</text>
  <text start="843.339" dur="4.33">investors were rushing in to open new</text>
  <text start="845.779" dur="4.081">brokerage accounts and invest their</text>
  <text start="847.669" dur="4.201">savings in the stock market because why</text>
  <text start="849.86" dur="5.219">they saw that while the markets going up</text>
  <text start="851.87" dur="6.45">dot-com is the wave of the future it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="855.079" dur="5.94">basically all created to bring in the</text>
  <text start="858.32" dur="4.769">retail investor and what happened was</text>
  <text start="861.019" dur="3.601">that the Nasdaq well that fell by nearly</text>
  <text start="863.089" dur="4.051">eighty percent over the next two and a</text>
  <text start="864.62" dur="3.99">half years and it wiped out trillions of</text>
  <text start="867.14" dur="5.3">dollars of wealth from the retail</text>
  <text start="868.61" dur="7.68">investor the last phase of any bubble is</text>
  <text start="872.44" dur="6.339">almost invariably your fork shopping</text>
  <text start="876.29" dur="5.16">spree of an irrational public that buy</text>
  <text start="878.779" dur="6.961">stocks real estate and everything else</text>
  <text start="881.45" dur="7.05">at record highs believing that prices</text>
  <text start="885.74" dur="4.409">will keep rising indefinitely that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="888.5" dur="3.959">what happened during the dot-com bubble</text>
  <text start="890.149" dur="4.261">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and</text>
  <text start="892.459" dur="3.87">if we look at what happened in 2008 what</text>
  <text start="894.41" dur="4.65">wiii happen in two thousand and all</text>
  <text start="896.329" dur="5.851">throughout history it&amp;#39;s always the same</text>
  <text start="899.06" dur="4.86">thing over and over it might switch to</text>
  <text start="902.18" dur="4.26">different sectors of the economy but</text>
  <text start="903.92" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s the same thing it&amp;#39;s one gigantic</text>
  <text start="906.44" dur="4.17">manipulation to make people believe that</text>
  <text start="909.35" dur="3.15">this is what&amp;#39;s happening and those</text>
  <text start="910.61" dur="4.44">individuals that created the bubble they</text>
  <text start="912.5" dur="4.23">get out everyone else gets in and they</text>
  <text start="915.05" dur="3.09">crash the system because now they&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="916.73" dur="3.66">the other side we&amp;#39;re going to make a</text>
  <text start="918.14" dur="3.72">profit coming down and this is what</text>
  <text start="920.39" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now but this time it</text>
  <text start="921.86" dur="6.18">is completely different because we are</text>
  <text start="925.37" dur="5.75">much worse off than we&amp;#39;ve ever been</text>
  <text start="928.04" dur="6.75">before they never fix the problems in</text>
  <text start="931.12" dur="6.339">2008 and we are going to see a collapse</text>
