  <text start="68.869" dur="5.701">messages about gold holdings let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="72.8" dur="4.77">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="74.57" dur="5.189">news now as we follow each economic</text>
  <text start="77.57" dur="4.65">indicator we&amp;#39;re starting to realize that</text>
  <text start="79.759" dur="3.871">it&amp;#39;s not just isolated to the United</text>
  <text start="82.22" dur="4.17">States and we proved it many many times</text>
  <text start="83.63" dur="3.9">where this is all happening in every</text>
  <text start="86.39" dur="3.869">single country and a lot of these</text>
  <text start="87.53" dur="6.03">countries aren&amp;#39;t a huge amount of debt</text>
  <text start="90.259" dur="5.941">they have high unemployment retail sales</text>
  <text start="93.56" dur="7.02">are declining and we&amp;#39;re getting a report</text>
  <text start="96.2" dur="6.39">from the UK and the data is from the</text>
  <text start="100.58" dur="4.2">Confederation of British industry and</text>
  <text start="102.59" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re showing that UK retail sales</text>
  <text start="104.78" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;ve dropped at the fastest pace</text>
  <text start="106.67" dur="6.63">since July of 2016 and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="110.99" dur="4.379">right now from the data is showing that</text>
  <text start="113.3" dur="4.83">34 percent of the retail said the sale</text>
  <text start="115.369" dur="6.561">volumes were up in August on a year ago</text>
  <text start="118.13" dur="7.44">while 44 percent said they were down and</text>
  <text start="121.93" dur="6.13">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the UK</text>
  <text start="125.57" dur="5.159">retailers they are seeing falling sales</text>
  <text start="128.06" dur="4.769">and they&amp;#39;re not seeing the gains that</text>
  <text start="130.729" dur="3.391">they&amp;#39;ve been seeing before and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="132.829" dur="3.511">scratching their heads trying to figure</text>
  <text start="134.12" dur="3.869">out what is going on here in the United</text>
  <text start="136.34" dur="4.23">States we are seeing the same exact</text>
  <text start="137.989" dur="5.191">thing Sears for instance their sales</text>
  <text start="140.57" dur="4.5">have plunged by 11.5 percent traffic is</text>
  <text start="143.18" dur="4.5">drying up they&amp;#39;re going to be closing</text>
  <text start="145.07" dur="6">another 28 stores and we need to</text>
  <text start="147.68" dur="5.49">remember what the CEO of dick said they</text>
  <text start="151.07" dur="4.169">are in panic mode right now because they</text>
  <text start="153.17" dur="3.659">starting to realize that these high</text>
  <text start="155.239" dur="3.661">prices you know people just don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="156.829" dur="5.511">to pay for them and yes they are going</text>
  <text start="158.9" dur="6.66">to be looking at different stores online</text>
  <text start="162.34" dur="6.429">retailers but what is happening right</text>
  <text start="165.56" dur="7.04">now is that people just don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="168.769" dur="6.181">funds to go out and purchase these goods</text>
  <text start="172.6" dur="5.5">Sears is seeing the same store sales</text>
  <text start="174.95" dur="5.849">plunged by 11.5 percent this is worse</text>
  <text start="178.1" dur="4.8">than expected they expected a 7.1</text>
  <text start="180.799" dur="4.831">percent decline and it is much much</text>
  <text start="182.9" dur="4.06">worse so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="185.63" dur="4.87">that retail</text>
  <text start="186.96" dur="6.09">is still declining it&amp;#39;s getting worse</text>
  <text start="190.5" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s not improving people are not going</text>
  <text start="193.05" dur="3.21">and saying okay I&amp;#39;m not gonna shop in</text>
  <text start="195.15" dur="3.42">the retail stores I&amp;#39;m going to be going</text>
  <text start="196.26" dur="3.99">online what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that people</text>
  <text start="198.57" dur="2.97">who are and of course these people that</text>
  <text start="200.25" dur="3.09">are losing their jobs the people that</text>
  <text start="201.54" dur="3.72">are taking part-time jobs they just</text>
  <text start="203.34" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t have the funds this is why we see</text>
  <text start="205.26" dur="4.68">all of this happening has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="207.06" dur="4.8">with the weather the solar eclipse or</text>
  <text start="209.94" dur="4.32">anything else and I know the corporate</text>
  <text start="211.86" dur="5.22">media has been trying to explain this</text>
  <text start="214.26" dur="5.34">away of why this is happening and Sears</text>
  <text start="217.08" dur="5.22">came out with why they think this is</text>
  <text start="219.6" dur="4.74">happening now the company blamed a</text>
  <text start="222.3" dur="4.47">retail environment that remained</text>
  <text start="224.34" dur="4.62">challenging with continued softness in</text>
  <text start="226.77" dur="5.91">store traffic and elevated price</text>
  <text start="228.96" dur="5.48">competition well yes traffic is drying</text>
  <text start="232.68" dur="5.28">up because people don&amp;#39;t have the money</text>
  <text start="234.44" dur="5.2">prices they are way too high because</text>
  <text start="237.96" dur="4.23">people don&amp;#39;t have that discretionary</text>
  <text start="239.64" dur="4.62">fund the discretionary funds to go out</text>
  <text start="242.19" dur="5.4">and purchase these Goods so yes these</text>
  <text start="244.26" dur="5.16">are true but why is this happening they</text>
  <text start="247.59" dur="4.11">always leave that part out it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="249.42" dur="4.62">happening because the economy is</text>
  <text start="251.7" dur="3.81">breaking down and we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="254.04" dur="3.54">this for quite a while I mean if we go</text>
  <text start="255.51" dur="3.27">back a couple of years when we said the</text>
  <text start="257.58" dur="2.76">holiday season was going to be</text>
  <text start="258.78" dur="4.08">absolutely awful in retail sales were</text>
  <text start="260.34" dur="4.83">gonna be down guess what each year after</text>
  <text start="262.86" dur="4.65">that it has come true it&amp;#39;s gotten worse</text>
  <text start="265.17" dur="5.25">and worse and worse until this year</text>
  <text start="267.51" dur="6.18">where we see stores by the thousands</text>
  <text start="270.42" dur="6.03">well they&amp;#39;re closing down we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="273.69" dur="4.8">talking about real estate how this is a</text>
  <text start="276.45" dur="4.02">complete and utter disaster even the</text>
  <text start="278.49" dur="4.05">corporate media right now is picking up</text>
  <text start="280.47" dur="3.51">on it and they&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="282.54" dur="3.3">situation saying that you know</text>
  <text start="283.98" dur="4.35">California right now is in crisis mode</text>
  <text start="285.84" dur="5.76">and first we had new home sales where</text>
  <text start="288.33" dur="7.04">they decline now we&amp;#39;re seeing existing</text>
  <text start="291.6" dur="7.47">home sales they fell back to negative</text>
  <text start="295.37" dur="6.99">2.0 percent in June and negative 1.3</text>
  <text start="299.07" dur="7.11">percent in July now remember the summer</text>
  <text start="302.36" dur="7.75">months are supposed to be the great time</text>
  <text start="306.18" dur="6.35">for real estate why because first of all</text>
  <text start="310.11" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s summer we&amp;#39;ve come out of winter</text>
  <text start="312.53" dur="5.59">people want to be in their new homes</text>
  <text start="315.36" dur="4.53">before their children start school it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="318.12" dur="2.549">easier to move into the homes and</text>
  <text start="319.89" dur="3.779">normally</text>
  <text start="320.669" dur="5.46">between the months of April and the</text>
  <text start="323.669" dur="4.53">months of September real estate does</text>
  <text start="326.129" dur="2.521">very very well once we enter the winter</text>
  <text start="328.199" dur="3.421">months</text>
  <text start="328.65" dur="6.06">guess what things start to really fall</text>
  <text start="331.62" dur="4.74">apart and here we are entering September</text>
  <text start="334.71" dur="4.62">and they&amp;#39;re telling us that June and</text>
  <text start="336.36" dur="5.85">July were awful so we have new home</text>
  <text start="339.33" dur="7.739">construction down we have existing home</text>
  <text start="342.21" dur="7.28">sales down pending home sales down this</text>
  <text start="347.069" dur="3.84">winter is going to be a complete</text>
  <text start="349.49" dur="4.51">disaster</text>
  <text start="350.909" dur="5.85">now Pam Martens and Russ Martens they</text>
  <text start="354" dur="4.59">looked into corporate debt and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="356.759" dur="5.46">saying that corporate debt threatens the</text>
  <text start="358.59" dur="6.75">u.s. economic prospects now according to</text>
  <text start="362.219" dur="5.7">a recent study US corporations their</text>
  <text start="365.34" dur="4.949">debt level well they could pose some</text>
  <text start="367.919" dur="5.28">serious headwinds for the United States</text>
  <text start="370.289" dur="5.791">economy in the next major downturn why</text>
  <text start="373.199" dur="6.3">is this what we need to go back to April</text>
  <text start="376.08" dur="5.19">the IMF announced that they see some red</text>
  <text start="379.499" dur="3.811">flags they&amp;#39;re saying that the US</text>
  <text start="381.27" dur="3.84">corporate sector has added around seven</text>
  <text start="383.31" dur="4.02">point eight trillion in debt and other</text>
  <text start="385.11" dur="4.41">liabilities since 2010 of course this is</text>
  <text start="387.33" dur="5.839">what happened during this recovery</text>
  <text start="389.52" dur="7.199">process and among the S&amp;amp;P 500 firms</text>
  <text start="393.169" dur="5.65">median net debt is close to an historic</text>
  <text start="396.719" dur="5.521">high of more than one-and-a-half times</text>
  <text start="398.819" dur="6.09">earnings now if we look at nearly 4,000</text>
  <text start="402.24" dur="4.289">firms accounting for about half of the</text>
  <text start="404.909" dur="5.03">economy wide corporate sector balance</text>
  <text start="406.529" dur="7.2">sheets we see that there is a rise in</text>
  <text start="409.939" dur="6.521">leverage across almost all sectors two</text>
  <text start="413.729" dur="6.53">levels exceeding those prevailing just</text>
  <text start="416.46" dur="7.049">before yes the 2008 global financial</text>
  <text start="420.259" dur="6.25">crisis now debt is very high right now</text>
  <text start="423.509" dur="5.52">in energy real estate utility sectors</text>
  <text start="426.509" dur="5.46">ranging between four and six times</text>
  <text start="429.029" dur="4.56">earnings and we need to understand what</text>
  <text start="431.969" dur="4.591">these corporations have been doing</text>
  <text start="433.589" dur="5.01">because much of the debt that has been</text>
  <text start="436.56" dur="5.039">sold by companies in the last couple of</text>
  <text start="438.599" dur="5.34">years guess what it has been used to buy</text>
  <text start="441.599" dur="4.651">back their own shares pay out higher</text>
  <text start="443.939" dur="6.54">dividends or finance big mergers and</text>
  <text start="446.25" dur="6.06">acquisitions well these buybacks funded</text>
  <text start="450.479" dur="4.031">by cheap borrowing have boosted earnings</text>
  <text start="452.31" dur="5.08">a missing ingredient</text>
  <text start="454.51" dur="5.46">has been spending on investment to build</text>
  <text start="457.39" dur="6.09">their business so they bought back these</text>
  <text start="459.97" dur="5.51">shares with this cheap debt because the</text>
  <text start="463.48" dur="4.56">interest rates are very very low and</text>
  <text start="465.48" dur="5.86">they boosted their earnings which is not</text>
  <text start="468.04" dur="6.9">the same as revenue and sales but they</text>
  <text start="471.34" dur="7.23">haven&amp;#39;t built their businesses up so now</text>
  <text start="474.94" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re on the hook for all this debt</text>
  <text start="478.57" dur="5.52">without increasing their revenue and</text>
  <text start="480.85" dur="6.39">sales why didn&amp;#39;t they increase their</text>
  <text start="484.09" dur="7.23">revenue in sales because they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="487.24" dur="5.85">look at Caterpillar look at IBM look at</text>
  <text start="491.32" dur="5.49">all these corporations they&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="493.09" dur="6.21">very difficult time what they could do</text>
  <text start="496.81" dur="5.04">and what they did do is they bought back</text>
  <text start="499.3" dur="6.18">their shares and made their companies</text>
  <text start="501.85" dur="5.16">look fantastic and when it all falls</text>
  <text start="505.48" dur="3.8">apart everyone&amp;#39;s gonna be looking at</text>
  <text start="507.01" dur="4.98">this saying what just happened here</text>
  <text start="509.28" dur="5.26">so we&amp;#39;re approaching the same thing that</text>
  <text start="511.99" dur="6">happened prior to the financial crisis</text>
  <text start="514.54" dur="5.129">of 2008 the corporations have done the</text>
  <text start="517.99" dur="8.01">same exact thing and we heard Bear</text>
  <text start="519.669" dur="8.341">Stearns Lehman AIG GM Chrysler and many</text>
  <text start="526" dur="3.81">other corporations welp we found out</text>
  <text start="528.01" dur="4.05">that pretty much all these corporations</text>
  <text start="529.81" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re bankrupt they should have been</text>
  <text start="532.06" dur="6.99">out of business a long time ago now we</text>
  <text start="535.03" dur="8.25">know that Steve minuchin he visited Fort</text>
  <text start="539.05" dur="6.48">Knox and he went and visited Fort Knox</text>
  <text start="543.28" dur="5.13">with Senate Majority Leader Mitch</text>
  <text start="545.53" dur="5.91">McConnell Kentucky governor Matt Bevin</text>
  <text start="548.41" dur="6.63">and Kentucky congressman Brett Guthrie</text>
  <text start="551.44" dur="5.91">and they looked at the gold storage and</text>
  <text start="555.04" dur="4.74">of course minuchin said yes everything</text>
  <text start="557.35" dur="4.77">is there don&amp;#39;t worry the gold is safe</text>
  <text start="559.78" dur="4.11">and we reported that something is kind</text>
  <text start="562.12" dur="4.38">of strange about this whole situation</text>
  <text start="563.89" dur="4.86">because there has been a Treasury</text>
  <text start="566.5" dur="5.94">secretary to visit the gold vaults in</text>
  <text start="568.75" dur="5.93">like seventy years or so now there is</text>
  <text start="572.44" dur="4.23">about four thousand eight hundred and</text>
  <text start="574.68" dur="4.36">four thousand five hundred and</text>
  <text start="576.67" dur="6.51">eighty-three tons of gold in Fort Knox</text>
  <text start="579.04" dur="6.93">well allegedly now the media they were</text>
  <text start="583.18" dur="4.89">not alerted to this visit they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="585.97" dur="3.96">invited there&amp;#39;s no pictures</text>
  <text start="588.07" dur="5.069">well there&amp;#39;s no pictures allowed in Fort</text>
  <text start="589.93" dur="4.769">Knox anyhow but the media they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="593.139" dur="3.361">really told about this which is kind of</text>
  <text start="594.699" dur="5.63">strange right off the bat</text>
  <text start="596.5" dur="7.47">now there are 13 different chambers</text>
  <text start="600.329" dur="8.531">within Fort Knox and each chamber has a</text>
  <text start="603.97" dur="6.96">seal and inside is gold now what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="608.86" dur="5.849">seen is that Senate Majority Leader</text>
  <text start="610.93" dur="6.899">Mitch McConnell he held a 27 pound gold</text>
  <text start="614.709" dur="5.791">bar in his hands saying that look here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="617.829" dur="6.24">the gold everything is great now they</text>
  <text start="620.5" dur="5.85">went into one area they broke the seal</text>
  <text start="624.069" dur="3.301">they went in and they said gold was</text>
  <text start="626.35" dur="5.58">there there&amp;#39;s no pictures</text>
  <text start="627.37" dur="7.709">the other 12 compartments they never</text>
  <text start="631.93" dur="6.24">even looked in does this prove that the</text>
  <text start="635.079" dur="6.271">gold is there no it does not it just</text>
  <text start="638.17" dur="5.51">says that they went into one compartment</text>
  <text start="641.35" dur="4.32">they showed us one bar of gold and</text>
  <text start="643.68" dur="5.86">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince the American</text>
  <text start="645.67" dur="8.01">people that everything is fine now Jim</text>
  <text start="649.54" dur="6.51">Rickards is saying that our gold in Fort</text>
  <text start="653.68" dur="3.17">Knox he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s saying that it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="656.05" dur="4.05">there</text>
  <text start="656.85" dur="5.38">now I don&amp;#39;t know this for sure a lot of</text>
  <text start="660.1" dur="5.51">people are saying absolutely not and</text>
  <text start="662.23" dur="7.26">this is why the central banks have been</text>
  <text start="665.61" dur="6.61">raiding the gold vaults of different</text>
  <text start="669.49" dur="6.3">countries like Libya like Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="672.22" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;ve been using this gold to send off</text>
  <text start="675.79" dur="2.88">to other places like Germany and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="677.41" dur="4.5">gonna talk about that in a minute</text>
  <text start="678.67" dur="5.24">but he went on to say that during the</text>
  <text start="681.91" dur="4.53">Great Depression in 1933 Roosevelt</text>
  <text start="683.91" dur="4.81">issued an executive order requiring</text>
  <text start="686.44" dur="5.28">anyone with gold to surrender it to the</text>

  <text start="696.519" dur="4.92">commercial banks to hand over their gold</text>
  <text start="698.35" dur="5.13">to the Fed now suddenly the gold went</text>

  <text start="708.31" dur="5.1">to surrender all of its gold to the</text>
  <text start="710.56" dur="4.219">Treasury Department so all the nation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="713.41" dur="4.64">gold in effect came under direct</text>
  <text start="714.779" dur="7.001">government ownership now this is the key</text>

  <text start="738.21" dur="7.63">this just compensation they issued a</text>
  <text start="741.85" dur="8.07">gold certificate to the Fed in exchange</text>
  <text start="745.84" dur="6.48">for the physical gold so if you take the</text>
  <text start="749.92" dur="4.68">face value of the gold of the Fed and on</text>
  <text start="752.32" dur="4.98">their balance sheet divided by forty two</text>
  <text start="754.6" dur="4.17">dollars an ounce and then come up with</text>
  <text start="757.3" dur="3.87">the number of ounces and convert that</text>
  <text start="758.77" dur="5.64">into tons it comes out to around eight</text>
  <text start="761.17" dur="4.98">thousand tons that&amp;#39;s highly interesting</text>
  <text start="764.41" dur="4.32">because that&amp;#39;s how much gold the</text>
  <text start="766.15" dur="4.29">Treasury currently owns the Treasury</text>
  <text start="768.73" dur="3.96">needs at least eight thousand tons of</text>

  <text start="772.69" dur="5.4">handed the Fed back in the 30s to</text>
  <text start="775.63" dur="5.46">satisfy the Fifth Amendment if you take</text>

  <text start="785.71" dur="5.91">amount is around three it&amp;#39;s well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="788.83" dur="4.53">over three hundred billion dollars so</text>
  <text start="791.62" dur="4.2">the secret to the Fed&amp;#39;s balance sheet is</text>
  <text start="793.36" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s hidden gold asset that gold</text>
  <text start="795.82" dur="4.019">certificate it received from the</text>
  <text start="797.5" dur="4.44">Treasury in the 30s nobody talks about</text>
  <text start="799.839" dur="5.671">this or admits to it but the whole</text>
  <text start="801.94" dur="6.33">system is based on gold but what about</text>
  <text start="805.51" dur="5.43">the gold in Fort Knox is it actually</text>
  <text start="808.27" dur="4.98">there now Jim Rickards is saying that he</text>
  <text start="810.94" dur="5.88">spoke to people and he&amp;#39;s saying that yes</text>
  <text start="813.25" dur="6">it is there other people have come out</text>
  <text start="816.82" dur="4.5">and said it is not there whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="819.25" dur="5.339">I&amp;#39;m under the impression that it is</text>
  <text start="821.32" dur="6.54">completely not there whatsoever this is</text>
  <text start="824.589" dur="5.341">why we&amp;#39;ve been raiding other gold vaults</text>
  <text start="827.86" dur="4.26">in different countries and sending it</text>
  <text start="829.93" dur="8.159">off and recasting it and sending it off</text>
  <text start="832.12" dur="8.07">to countries like Germany so the Fed has</text>
  <text start="838.089" dur="5.641">never been audited Fort Knox has not</text>
  <text start="840.19" dur="6.99">been audited and we know why they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="843.73" dur="5.57">want us to audit the Fed or Fort Knox</text>
  <text start="847.18" dur="4.37">because they&amp;#39;re trying to make gold look</text>
  <text start="849.3" dur="4.93">unimportant you don&amp;#39;t have to audit</text>
  <text start="851.55" dur="3.61">unimportant things and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="854.23" dur="3.149">what there</text>
  <text start="855.16" dur="4.26">trying to do they&amp;#39;re trying to say that</text>
  <text start="857.379" dur="3.63">yeah the golden four it&amp;#39;s unimportant we</text>
  <text start="859.42" dur="4.589">don&amp;#39;t need to audit it it&amp;#39;s not a really</text>
  <text start="861.009" dur="4.89">big deal it&amp;#39;s a barbarous relic because</text>
  <text start="864.009" dur="3.801">they trying to push people away from</text>
  <text start="865.899" dur="5.19">that and push them towards the dollar</text>
  <text start="867.81" dur="7.24">now the reason why I don&amp;#39;t think there</text>
  <text start="871.089" dur="6.3">is actually gold in Fort Knox is because</text>
  <text start="875.05" dur="4.68">what has happened in Germany now we know</text>
  <text start="877.389" dur="5.731">that Germany has they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="879.73" dur="5.459">repatriating their gold and there were a</text>
  <text start="883.12" dur="4.86">couple of pictures that were put up</text>
  <text start="885.189" dur="5.671">showing the gold coming back the gold</text>
  <text start="887.98" dur="5.25">bars with numbers on it some have it</text>
  <text start="890.86" dur="5.25">stamped some are stamped on the side and</text>
  <text start="893.23" dur="5.099">the bars of gold look old and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="896.11" dur="4.789">receiving gold from Paris and the US now</text>
  <text start="898.329" dur="5.671">the goal from Paris well it looks like</text>
  <text start="900.899" dur="5.88">it&amp;#39;s pretty darn old it&amp;#39;s you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="904" dur="6.689">worn the numbers are a little bit faded</text>
  <text start="906.779" dur="8.651">but the gold that they received from the</text>
  <text start="910.689" dur="9.63">US looks like it was freshly minted and</text>
  <text start="915.43" dur="7.5">they have bright labels on them which is</text>
  <text start="920.319" dur="5.731">very interesting in itself now the</text>
  <text start="922.93" dur="5.339">question is why did Germany recall all</text>
  <text start="926.05" dur="4.32">the gold why minuchin why did he go down</text>
  <text start="928.269" dur="5.791">to Fort Knox and made this make this</text>
  <text start="930.37" dur="5.819">really big deal about the gold because</text>
  <text start="934.06" dur="4.86">what is happening here and we can see it</text>
  <text start="936.189" dur="6.931">with China and Russia every single</text>
  <text start="938.92" dur="6.149">country has been acquiring gold except</text>
  <text start="943.12" dur="4.29">the United States now they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="945.069" dur="5.311">convince us they don&amp;#39;t have to because</text>
  <text start="947.41" dur="6.09">the gold is already there he already</text>
  <text start="950.38" dur="5.85">told you it is safe because these</text>
  <text start="953.5" dur="5.579">countries realize when the dollar comes</text>
  <text start="956.23" dur="5.07">down they&amp;#39;re going to need an insurance</text>
  <text start="959.079" dur="4.74">policy that insurance policy is either</text>
  <text start="961.3" dur="5.009">gold or silver this is why all the</text>
  <text start="963.819" dur="3.931">countries are going as quickly as they</text>
  <text start="966.309" dur="4.08">possibly can to get as much gold as</text>
  <text start="967.75" dur="4.41">possible this is why minutia n-- decided</text>
  <text start="970.389" dur="6.091">to show the American People that</text>
  <text start="972.16" dur="6.659">everything is fine and why the United</text>
  <text start="976.48" dur="6.99">States hasn&amp;#39;t been acquiring gold over</text>
  <text start="978.819" dur="8.37">these many many years well this shows us</text>
  <text start="983.47" dur="5.89">that the collapse is coming very very</text>
  <text start="987.189" dur="4.481">quickly because these con</text>
  <text start="989.36" dur="4.71">trees they&amp;#39;re preparing themselves for</text>
  <text start="991.67" dur="4.77">it and just by venusian going down there</text>
  <text start="994.07" dur="5.16">and looking at the goal this tells us</text>
  <text start="996.44" dur="5.97">that there is something wrong here I</text>
  <text start="999.23" dur="4.65">mean they would have shown a lot more I</text>
  <text start="1002.41" dur="3.57">know you can&amp;#39;t take pictures in there</text>
  <text start="1003.88" dur="4.17">but they could have set something up to</text>
  <text start="1005.98" dur="5.13">show the American people that yes here</text>
  <text start="1008.05" dur="7.5">it all is and they would have gone into</text>
  <text start="1011.11" dur="7.2">every single compartment not just one so</text>
  <text start="1015.55" dur="6">this tells us that we&amp;#39;re headed to</text>
  <text start="1018.31" dur="7.139">something catastrophic where the dollar</text>
  <text start="1021.55" dur="5.73">is going to die countries have been</text>
  <text start="1025.449" dur="3.691">acquiring gold they&amp;#39;re gonna use it as</text>
  <text start="1027.28" dur="3.69">an insurance policy China and Russia</text>
  <text start="1029.14" dur="4.679">have been quite quite a bit</text>
  <text start="1030.97" dur="5.699">Germany they got their goal back ahead</text>
  <text start="1033.819" dur="4.26">of schedule and the United States is</text>
  <text start="1036.669" dur="5.42">telling everyone don&amp;#39;t worry about it</text>
  <text start="1038.079" dur="6.63">everything is fine this tells us that</text>
  <text start="1042.089" dur="3.791">something big is about to happen and</text>
  <text start="1044.709" dur="3.391">this is why we&amp;#39;ve been telling you to</text>
  <text start="1045.88" dur="3.96">get prepared because we can see from all</text>
  <text start="1048.1" dur="3.24">of the different parts of the economic</text>
  <text start="1049.84" dur="4.11">sectors that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="1051.34" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re indicating that this system is</text>
  <text start="1053.95" dur="4.969">completely falling apart countries are</text>
  <text start="1055.9" dur="6.75">already moving away from the dollar so</text>
  <text start="1058.919" dur="6.101">when this thing comes down it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="1062.65" dur="4.83">come out that the u.s. really has no</text>
  <text start="1065.02" dur="4.38">gold or maybe they have half of what</text>
  <text start="1067.48" dur="4.53">they say or maybe a quarter of what they</text>
