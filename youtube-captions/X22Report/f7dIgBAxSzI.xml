  <text start="62.329" dur="5.851">September 4th 2017 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="65.21" dur="6.45">episode is D dollarization begins China</text>
  <text start="68.18" dur="5.579">ready to you wan base crude oil let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="71.66" dur="4.65">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="73.759" dur="5.311">news now the cryptocurrency market it</text>
  <text start="76.31" dur="4.98">has been taking a beating and we can see</text>
  <text start="79.07" dur="3.87">there&amp;#39;s certain countries out there and</text>
  <text start="81.29" dur="4.499">this is backed up by the central bank</text>
  <text start="82.94" dur="6.09">because we know that they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="85.789" dur="6">this decentralization of the</text>
  <text start="89.03" dur="4.65">cryptocurrency market and they want to</text>
  <text start="91.789" dur="3.931">be in control this is why UBS right now</text>
  <text start="93.68" dur="3.57">with many other banks and the central</text>
  <text start="95.72" dur="4.17">bank this is why they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="97.25" dur="4.89">control the situation with the</text>
  <text start="99.89" dur="3.96">blockchain technology and we can see</text>
  <text start="102.14" dur="2.85">right now that the Kremlin is out there</text>
  <text start="103.85" dur="3.48">saying that they need some rules for</text>
  <text start="104.99" dur="4.11">cryptocurrency circulation it should be</text>
  <text start="107.33" dur="3.539">discussed we see China is out there</text>
  <text start="109.1" dur="5.07">right now and they are talking about</text>
  <text start="110.869" dur="5.701">that the initial coin offerings they are</text>
  <text start="114.17" dur="4.11">completely illegal and even here in the</text>
  <text start="116.57" dur="3.06">United States they want to control the</text>
  <text start="118.28" dur="3.24">initial coin offerings they want to</text>
  <text start="119.63" dur="3">control Bitcoin they want to control the</text>
  <text start="121.52" dur="3.689">whole block chain the whole</text>
  <text start="122.63" dur="5.04">cryptocurrency market and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="125.209" dur="4.171">to wrap all of this around regulations</text>
  <text start="127.67" dur="4.11">which is going to be very difficult to</text>
  <text start="129.38" dur="5.07">do because again this is decentralized</text>
  <text start="131.78" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s not centralized in a certain</text>
  <text start="134.45" dur="5.31">country and we can see at this point it</text>
  <text start="136.79" dur="4.74">is very difficult for them to stop from</text>
  <text start="139.76" dur="4.949">what is happening especially when you</text>
  <text start="141.53" dur="5.789">keep a lot of your currency offline in</text>
  <text start="144.709" dur="5.071">your offline wallet and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="147.319" dur="4.771">to figure out ways on how they can</text>
  <text start="149.78" dur="4.289">create regulation how they can control</text>
  <text start="152.09" dur="3.66">this this is why the banks the central</text>
  <text start="154.069" dur="3.691">bank&amp;#39;s this is why they&amp;#39;re pushing their</text>
  <text start="155.75" dur="4.29">agenda and trying to you know take</text>
  <text start="157.76" dur="4.949">control of the market but this is going</text>
  <text start="160.04" dur="4.32">to be very difficult and we can see as</text>
  <text start="162.709" dur="3.331">we&amp;#39;re moving forward right now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="164.36" dur="3.75">gonna hear a lot more of these stories</text>
  <text start="166.04" dur="3.75">because we start and realize there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="168.11" dur="2.879">lot more people looking into this so</text>
  <text start="169.79" dur="2.43">there&amp;#39;s a lot more people saying you</text>
  <text start="170.989" dur="3.961">know something let me get into crypto</text>
  <text start="172.22" dur="4.349">currency it&amp;#39;s not widely known right now</text>
  <text start="174.95" dur="3.75">people have heard of it but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="176.569" dur="4.14">really not into it right now but as this</text>
  <text start="178.7" dur="5.7">grows just like the internet you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="180.709" dur="6.941">going to see the countries the central</text>
  <text start="184.4" dur="4.63">bank&amp;#39;s the powers that be try to control</text>
  <text start="187.65" dur="3.449">this market and this is something that</text>
  <text start="189.03" dur="3.87">we need to watch because we need to keep</text>
  <text start="191.099" dur="3.78">this separate and apart from the central</text>
  <text start="192.9" dur="3.99">banks from the banking system we need to</text>
  <text start="194.879" dur="4.021">keep this decentralized we need this we</text>
  <text start="196.89" dur="5.28">need to keep this in the hands of the</text>
  <text start="198.9" dur="6.209">people and we can see as we move forward</text>
  <text start="202.17" dur="5.129">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to take this away we</text>
  <text start="205.109" dur="4.201">see here in the United States well the</text>
  <text start="207.299" dur="3.931">working class right now they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="209.31" dur="3.48">afford the American Dream anymore and</text>
  <text start="211.23" dur="4.679">we&amp;#39;ve known this for a very long time</text>
  <text start="212.79" dur="5.88">now for millions of middle and working</text>
  <text start="215.909" dur="5.25">class Americans the American Dream well</text>
  <text start="218.67" dur="4.289">it&amp;#39;s pretty much gone and a lot of</text>
  <text start="221.159" dur="3.541">people are you know just getting by a</text>
  <text start="222.959" dur="4.321">lot of people can&amp;#39;t afford anything and</text>
  <text start="224.7" dur="4.649">from the feds latest survey on the</text>
  <text start="227.28" dur="4.2">well-being of the US households it has</text>
  <text start="229.349" dur="4.17">been revealed that nearly a quarter of</text>
  <text start="231.48" dur="4.409">Americans are unable to pay their</text>
  <text start="233.519" dur="7.5">monthly bills on time and nearly half</text>
  <text start="235.889" dur="6.69">have less than $400 in the bank and we</text>
  <text start="241.019" dur="4.47">can see right now there are certain</text>
  <text start="242.579" dur="4.621">cities where it is a lot easier to live</text>
  <text start="245.489" dur="3.241">in and there are other cities where it</text>
  <text start="247.2" dur="3.569">is much more difficult much more</text>
  <text start="248.73" dur="4.74">expensive to live in but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="250.769" dur="4.47">seeing right now is that there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="253.47" dur="3.9">of people out there that are struggling</text>
  <text start="255.239" dur="3.601">why are they struggling we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="257.37" dur="3.149">following this for a very long time</text>
  <text start="258.84" dur="3.93">people have been losing their jobs</text>
  <text start="260.519" dur="3.96">people lost their full-time jobs people</text>
  <text start="262.77" dur="3.75">have to get the part-time low-paying</text>
  <text start="264.479" dur="5.241">jobs maybe one of those maybe two of</text>
  <text start="266.52" dur="5.91">those and we can see as time went on</text>
  <text start="269.72" dur="4.36">they weren&amp;#39;t making as much as they were</text>
  <text start="272.43" dur="4.799">a lot of people lost their homes and</text>
  <text start="274.08" dur="5.519">they could never recover and it&amp;#39;s taking</text>
  <text start="277.229" dur="4.711">its toll right now and when we look at</text>
  <text start="279.599" dur="4.261">this we can see that the top five cities</text>
  <text start="281.94" dur="4.32">if you want to know what those are where</text>
  <text start="283.86" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s a little bit easier to live it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="286.26" dur="6.51">Fort Worth Texas Glendale Arizona</text>
  <text start="289.11" dur="6.779">Gilbert Arizona Mesa Arizona and the</text>
  <text start="292.77" dur="7.619">five worst cities are New York San</text>
  <text start="295.889" dur="7.5">Francisco Boston and Washington and we</text>
  <text start="300.389" dur="4.53">can see right now that as time goes on</text>
  <text start="303.389" dur="4.231">it&amp;#39;s going to get worse and worse</text>
  <text start="304.919" dur="4.591">because what happens in these areas</text>
  <text start="307.62" dur="3.269">where they&amp;#39;re pumping up the bubbles and</text>
  <text start="309.51" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re trying to make everything look</text>
  <text start="310.889" dur="4.111">like everything is fine once this starts</text>
  <text start="313.02" dur="3.48">to come down it&amp;#39;s not going to matter</text>
  <text start="315" dur="3.3">what city you&amp;#39;re in I mean it&amp;#39;ll be a</text>
  <text start="316.5" dur="3.96">little bit better than the others but</text>
  <text start="318.3" dur="3.54">it&amp;#39;s going to hit the entire country</text>
  <text start="320.46" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s not just going to be</text>
  <text start="321.84" dur="4.109">one little tiny area and what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="324.15" dur="5.7">watching what we&amp;#39;ve been tracking is</text>
  <text start="325.949" dur="6.651">that this entire system is imploding on</text>
  <text start="329.85" dur="5.4">itself and we have been seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="332.6" dur="5.319">indicators that have been showing us</text>
  <text start="335.25" dur="4.29">that we are in a recession already and</text>
  <text start="337.919" dur="3.361">of course you know the Fed the</text>
  <text start="339.54" dur="2.909">government the corporate media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="341.28" dur="3.06">not going to admit that we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="342.449" dur="3.601">recession I believe it started already</text>
  <text start="344.34" dur="2.82">in 2016 because all the indicators that</text>
  <text start="346.05" dur="3.33">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at everything that</text>
  <text start="347.16" dur="6.44">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking it&amp;#39;s pointing to a</text>
  <text start="349.38" dur="7.92">recession and we can see that a lot of</text>
  <text start="353.6" dur="6.1">the trading systems a lot of the payment</text>
  <text start="357.3" dur="4.74">systems a lot of pretty much everything</text>
  <text start="359.7" dur="4.8">has been moving from the west to the</text>
  <text start="362.04" dur="3.9">east and we know that China and Russia</text>
  <text start="364.5" dur="3.8">and many other countries they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="365.94" dur="6.6">basically bypassing the dollar now</text>
  <text start="368.3" dur="8.23">something interesting just happened the</text>
  <text start="372.54" dur="7.409">world&amp;#39;s top oil importer China they are</text>
  <text start="376.53" dur="6.72">preparing to launch a crude oil futures</text>
  <text start="379.949" dur="6.84">contract denominated in Chinese you want</text>
  <text start="383.25" dur="6.419">and convertible into gold now</text>
  <text start="386.789" dur="6.091">potentially this is going to create the</text>
  <text start="389.669" dur="7.201">most important Asian oil benchmark and</text>
  <text start="392.88" dur="8.28">allowing oil exporters to bypass the US</text>
  <text start="396.87" dur="8.19">dollar yes you heard this right they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="401.16" dur="6.6">going to bypass the US dollar now the</text>
  <text start="405.06" dur="5.22">crude oil futures will be the first</text>
  <text start="407.76" dur="5.07">commodity contract in China open to</text>
  <text start="410.28" dur="5.819">foreign investment funds trading houses</text>
  <text start="412.83" dur="5.28">and oil firms the circumvention of the</text>
  <text start="416.099" dur="5.04">US dollar trade could allow oil</text>
  <text start="418.11" dur="6.42">exporters such as Russia Iran and many</text>
  <text start="421.139" dur="8.371">other countries to bypass US sanctions</text>
  <text start="424.53" dur="8.91">by trading in the yuan so what does this</text>
  <text start="429.51" dur="6.33">mean this means that everything that we</text>
  <text start="433.44" dur="6.51">talked about about the yuan being in the</text>
  <text start="435.84" dur="7.259">basket of the SDR s China accumulating</text>
  <text start="439.95" dur="5.73">gold rush&amp;#39; accumulating gold creating</text>
  <text start="443.099" dur="5.401">the Shanghai exchange creating the</text>
  <text start="445.68" dur="5.97">payment systems moving everything from</text>
  <text start="448.5" dur="6.96">the west to east it is all coming true</text>
  <text start="451.65" dur="4.55">and they keep adding to it and as they</text>
  <text start="455.46" dur="4.13">add to it</text>
  <text start="456.2" dur="6.26">what happens well pretty soon you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="459.59" dur="7.53">need to trade in the dollar anymore</text>
  <text start="462.46" dur="6.22">countries will not need to hold on to</text>
  <text start="467.12" dur="5.94">the dollar I mean think about this for a</text>
  <text start="468.68" dur="7.44">second if they&amp;#39;re trading in the u one</text>
  <text start="473.06" dur="5.76">and it create this futures contracts and</text>
  <text start="476.12" dur="4.91">this goes even further there is no</text>
  <text start="478.82" dur="5.31">reason to have the dollar anymore and</text>
  <text start="481.03" dur="5.56">you know this is going to expand you</text>
  <text start="484.13" dur="4.05">know it&amp;#39;s going to continue on you know</text>
  <text start="486.59" dur="3.87">that more countries are going to get</text>
  <text start="488.18" dur="3.81">involved in this and if these countries</text>
  <text start="490.46" dur="3.48">say you know something we have other</text>
  <text start="491.99" dur="4.11">opportunities we don&amp;#39;t need to hold on</text>
  <text start="493.94" dur="3.6">to the dollar let&amp;#39;s get rid of the</text>
  <text start="496.1" dur="3.21">dollar in our reserves let&amp;#39;s send it</text>
  <text start="497.54" dur="3.3">back to United States let&amp;#39;s get rid of</text>
  <text start="499.31" dur="3.99">our Treasury bonds we don&amp;#39;t need them</text>
  <text start="500.84" dur="4.02">right now this all floods back to the</text>
  <text start="503.3" dur="3.81">United States which is going to be a</text>
  <text start="504.86" dur="6">complete disaster and we could see right</text>
  <text start="507.11" dur="6.63">now the powers are being they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="510.86" dur="4.98">this to happen now remember the yuyuan</text>
  <text start="513.74" dur="3.75">denominated futures contract it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="515.84" dur="3.99">like they just came up with it yesterday</text>
  <text start="517.49" dur="5.97">this contract has been in the works for</text>
  <text start="519.83" dur="5.22">years and it&amp;#39;s been delayed and it looks</text>
  <text start="523.46" dur="3.81">like it&amp;#39;s ready to be launched right now</text>
  <text start="525.05" dur="4.22">so they&amp;#39;ve been working on this and this</text>
  <text start="527.27" dur="4.32">has been planned because we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="529.27" dur="6.13">looking at this we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on</text>
  <text start="531.59" dur="5.49">this for quite a while and of course you</text>
  <text start="535.4" dur="3.3">know the corporate media and everyone</text>
  <text start="537.08" dur="3.03">else they&amp;#39;re not reporting on this</text>
  <text start="538.7" dur="5.16">because they&amp;#39;re pretending it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="540.11" dur="6.39">exist but it does exist and it takes a</text>
  <text start="543.86" dur="5.94">certain period of time to create these</text>
  <text start="546.5" dur="6.15">things and here we are already in 2017</text>
  <text start="549.8" dur="5.79">going into 2018 and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="552.65" dur="5.91">launch it this is just another nail in</text>
  <text start="555.59" dur="4.59">the dollar&amp;#39;s coffin so when people talk</text>
  <text start="558.56" dur="3.45">about oh no the dollars gonna last</text>
  <text start="560.18" dur="4.05">forever China is not doing anything</text>
  <text start="562.01" dur="4.56">think about what China has been doing</text>
  <text start="564.23" dur="5.46">think about what Russia has been doing</text>
  <text start="566.57" dur="5.16">all of this time slowly but surely no</text>
  <text start="569.69" dur="4.2">one&amp;#39;s really looking at it no one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="571.73" dur="4.08">really recognizing it yes they hear</text>
  <text start="573.89" dur="3.9">things but they&amp;#39;ve been creating the</text>
  <text start="575.81" dur="5.24">payment system they&amp;#39;ve been creating</text>
  <text start="577.79" dur="6.75">their exchange systems they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="581.05" dur="6.76">dealing without the dollar they are</text>
  <text start="584.54" dur="5.07">creating this future contract they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="587.81" dur="5.88">setting up the belton road</text>
  <text start="589.61" dur="6.93">they&amp;#39;ve established bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="593.69" dur="4.589">agreements with many many countries more</text>
  <text start="596.54" dur="5.1">countries are coming on to the belt and</text>

  <text start="617.81" dur="4.589">they&amp;#39;re moving on and this is why</text>
  <text start="620.66" dur="3.15">they&amp;#39;ve been setting all of this up this</text>
  <text start="622.399" dur="4.231">is why they&amp;#39;ve been moving everything to</text>
  <text start="623.81" dur="4.62">China because they knew the dollar only</text>
  <text start="626.63" dur="4.11">huh only had a certain period of time</text>
  <text start="628.43" dur="3.839">and they knew eventually what was going</text>
