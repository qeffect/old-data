  <text start="82.35" dur="4.68">weekend let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="84.899" dur="3.841">collapse news now yesterday we</text>
  <text start="87.03" dur="3.119">understand the unemployment numbers came</text>
  <text start="88.74" dur="4.32">out and I dropped him six point seven</text>
  <text start="90.149" dur="5.071">two six point three percent and new in</text>
  <text start="93.06" dur="4.44">the new york times they made a really</text>
  <text start="95.22" dur="5.13">great point to explain what exactly</text>
  <text start="97.5" dur="4.14">happened here and what they are saying</text>
  <text start="100.35" dur="4.199">is the number of people in the labor</text>
  <text start="101.64" dur="5.61">force fell by about eight hundred and</text>
  <text start="104.549" dur="6.091">six thousand wiping out the gains in</text>
  <text start="107.25" dur="5.64">February and march and some in january</text>
  <text start="110.64" dur="5.939">the labor force participation rate fell</text>
  <text start="112.89" dur="6">by 0.4% to about 1660 two-point-eight</text>
  <text start="116.579" dur="5.43">percent and this is returning it to the</text>
  <text start="118.89" dur="5.219">December level now if we really look at</text>
  <text start="122.009" dur="4.11">this the people reporting they were</text>
  <text start="124.109" dur="4.741">unemployed fell to about seven hundred</text>
  <text start="126.119" dur="4.951">and thirty three thousand which sounds</text>
  <text start="128.85" dur="4.23">good on its surface but paired with</text>
  <text start="131.07" dur="5.85">similar size decline in labor force</text>
  <text start="133.08" dur="7.92">points to job seekers what we are seeing</text>
  <text start="136.92" dur="7.92">is that 2.8 times as many people</text>
  <text start="141" dur="6">dropped out as found jobs so there are a</text>
  <text start="144.84" dur="4.8">lot more people dropping out than</text>
  <text start="147" dur="5.1">actually finding jobs to work in and</text>
  <text start="149.64" dur="5.1">this goes back to what has been</text>
  <text start="152.1" dur="5.73">happening and how they manipulate these</text>
  <text start="154.74" dur="6.21">numbers those people who&amp;#39;ve been on an</text>
  <text start="157.83" dur="5.58">interview or have not been in it on an</text>
  <text start="160.95" dur="4.62">interview in four weeks are not counted</text>
  <text start="163.41" dur="3.69">so if you have been on an interview with</text>
  <text start="165.57" dur="3.78">in the four weeks you are still counted</text>
  <text start="167.1" dur="4.08">if you have not you are not counted in</text>
  <text start="169.35" dur="4.83">the unemployment numbers so even though</text>
  <text start="171.18" dur="4.71">you&amp;#39;re sending out resumes two months</text>
  <text start="174.18" dur="5.309">three months four months down the line</text>
  <text start="175.89" dur="8.64">you are considered no longer looking and</text>
  <text start="179.489" dur="8.581">you completely have fallen off the job</text>
  <text start="184.53" dur="5.16">market right now and this is how they</text>
  <text start="188.07" dur="4.41">are manipulating a lot of these numbers</text>
  <text start="189.69" dur="4.44">now if you do find a job and let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="192.48" dur="3.21">you were making sixty seventy thousand</text>
  <text start="194.13" dur="4.92">in a full-time job and you found two</text>
  <text start="195.69" dur="5.31">part-time jobs you are counted twice so</text>
  <text start="199.05" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s two jobs added to the</text>
  <text start="201" dur="4.35">unemployment calculation so you can see</text>
  <text start="203.52" dur="4.17">how this is completely manipulated and</text>
  <text start="205.35" dur="5.79">you can see how they are using these</text>
  <text start="207.69" dur="6.81">numbers to convince everyone that we are</text>
  <text start="211.14" dur="5.64">up we are in a economic recovery and it</text>
  <text start="214.5" dur="4.41">is a complete illusion I mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="216.78" dur="4.26">just continually throwing numbers out</text>
  <text start="218.91" dur="4.26">there manipulating them any way they</text>
  <text start="221.04" dur="4.41">want they go back to the prior month</text>
  <text start="223.17" dur="4.74">they revise them they don&amp;#39;t say a word</text>
  <text start="225.45" dur="4.74">and nobody understands what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="227.91" dur="4.59">here now in the real estate market we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="230.19" dur="4.29">seeing the same exact thing they are</text>
  <text start="232.5" dur="4.38">manipulating a lot of the numbers</text>
  <text start="234.48" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re feeding free money into hedge</text>
  <text start="236.88" dur="7.23">funds and investment companies they are</text>
  <text start="238.98" dur="7.979">making cash purchases on homes and what</text>
  <text start="244.11" dur="4.349">this means is those Americans you know</text>
  <text start="246.959" dur="3.901">those people who&amp;#39;ve lost thirty eight</text>
  <text start="248.459" dur="5.37">percent of their wealth in 2008 lost</text>
  <text start="250.86" dur="7.349">their homes in 2008 lost their jobs in</text>
  <text start="253.829" dur="6.241">2008 lost their credit in 2008 no longer</text>
  <text start="258.209" dur="5.071">really have the ability to purchase</text>
  <text start="260.07" dur="5.22">another home at this time some people do</text>
  <text start="263.28" dur="4.53">get around it but mutton the majority of</text>
  <text start="265.29" dur="5.07">the people don&amp;#39;t have the ability and a</text>
  <text start="267.81" dur="4.74">lot of people had nice paying jobs now</text>
  <text start="270.36" dur="4.049">they&amp;#39;re in a lower paying jobs or have a</text>
  <text start="272.55" dur="3.539">couple of part-time</text>
  <text start="274.409" dur="3.451">paying jobs so they&amp;#39;re really not</text>
  <text start="276.089" dur="3.39">looking for the homes and of course the</text>
  <text start="277.86" dur="3.869">corporate media is out there saying that</text>
  <text start="279.479" dur="4.26">oh it&amp;#39;s the boomerang effect those</text>
  <text start="281.729" dur="4.23">people had bad credit lost their jobs</text>
  <text start="283.739" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re coming back into the market no</text>
  <text start="285.959" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re not that&amp;#39;s why they are putting</text>
  <text start="287.999" dur="4.77">in subprime adjustable-rate mortgages</text>
  <text start="290.879" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re trying to get anyone that has a</text>
  <text start="292.769" dur="4.62">pulse to purchase these houses from the</text>
  <text start="295.409" dur="3.84">hedge fund and the investment companies</text>
  <text start="297.389" dur="5.911">but what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing in Wells</text>
  <text start="299.249" dur="6.66">Fargo Citibank Bank of America JPMorgan</text>
  <text start="303.3" dur="5.519">Chase we&amp;#39;ve been seeing a mortgage</text>
  <text start="305.909" dur="5.19">origination continually declining since</text>
  <text start="308.819" dur="5.7">2012 since they&amp;#39;ve been pumping up this</text>
  <text start="311.099" dur="5.43">market and right now JP Morgan is out</text>
  <text start="314.519" dur="4.41">there saying yes the second quarter of</text>
  <text start="316.529" dur="4.53">housing is going to be horrible they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="318.929" dur="4.83">saying because of the interest rates are</text>
  <text start="321.059" dur="4.62">canar going to continually rise you know</text>
  <text start="323.759" dur="2.82">by point three percent a point two</text>
  <text start="325.679" dur="3.24">percent and that&amp;#39;s just going to</text>
  <text start="326.579" dur="4.95">demolish the housing market really these</text>
  <text start="328.919" dur="4.95">people do not have the cash to buy or</text>
  <text start="331.529" dur="4.14">the ability to take out a mortgage to</text>
  <text start="333.869" dur="3.27">buy these homes at this time and this is</text>
  <text start="335.669" dur="3.72">why they&amp;#39;ve been lowering the down</text>
  <text start="337.139" dur="4.14">payments also from twenty to twenty-five</text>
  <text start="339.389" dur="3.63">percent now it&amp;#39;s down to five they</text>
  <text start="341.279" dur="5.61">brought it even down to three and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="343.019" dur="5.76">seen places that are offering 0% one</text>
  <text start="346.889" dur="4.411">hundred percent financing at this time</text>
  <text start="348.779" dur="4.86">and they&amp;#39;re saying that the mortgage</text>
  <text start="351.3" dur="5.009">banking in the second quarter is going</text>
  <text start="353.639" dur="5.161">to be horrific the profits are going to</text>
  <text start="356.309" dur="5.28">be very low and we understand this</text>
  <text start="358.8" dur="5.189">because I don&amp;#39;t care what the corporate</text>
  <text start="361.589" dur="5.1">media is saying what the president is</text>
  <text start="363.989" dur="4.86">saying what the Fed is saying this is an</text>
  <text start="366.689" dur="4.77">illusion and from all the evidence of</text>
  <text start="368.849" dur="4.77">these banks with their mortgage</text>
  <text start="371.459" dur="5.28">departments laying off tens of thousands</text>
  <text start="373.619" dur="5.79">of people this is letting us know people</text>
  <text start="376.739" dur="6.9">are not taking out mortgages Americans</text>
  <text start="379.409" dur="6.75">are not buying these homes they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="383.639" dur="4.35">have the ability they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="386.159" dur="4.74">funds they don&amp;#39;t have the credit and</text>
  <text start="387.989" dur="5.7">this is going to drive the real estate</text>
  <text start="390.899" dur="4.59">market down even further it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="393.689" dur="4.95">get worse and this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="395.489" dur="5.19">retail stores closing I just went to</text>
  <text start="398.639" dur="3.6">radio shack today to get a battery and I</text>
  <text start="400.679" dur="4.47">walked up the whole thing&amp;#39;s closed</text>
  <text start="402.239" dur="5.871">cleared out and I remember back yes</text>
  <text start="405.149" dur="6.041">they&amp;#39;re closing but like 1,500 stores</text>
  <text start="408.11" dur="7.35">that the jobs the stores they are</text>
  <text start="411.19" dur="6.55">disappearing at this time now we</text>
  <text start="415.46" dur="6.03">understand in Syria the elections are</text>
  <text start="417.74" dur="7.34">coming up this June and ban ki-moon is</text>
  <text start="421.49" dur="6.24">already out there and he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="425.08" dur="5.14">the preparation for the presidential</text>
  <text start="427.73" dur="6">election in Syria scheduled for june</text>
  <text start="430.22" dur="6.75">third he believes they do not conform to</text>
  <text start="433.73" dur="5.1">the spirit of the Geneva communique the</text>
  <text start="436.97" dur="3.6">secretary-general noted that his</text>
  <text start="438.83" dur="3.99">position was shared by the United</text>
  <text start="440.57" dur="6.18">Nations the Arab League and the United</text>
  <text start="442.82" dur="6.69">States but of course it&amp;#39;s not uh in the</text>
  <text start="446.75" dur="5.07">spirit and we have to look at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="449.51" dur="4.95">going in you going on in Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="451.82" dur="5.13">what&amp;#39;s going on in Syria they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="454.46" dur="5.55">blaming Assad because he&amp;#39;s been using</text>
  <text start="456.95" dur="4.98">military force on his own people and he</text>
  <text start="460.01" dur="3.93">should not be president and we have to</text>
  <text start="461.93" dur="4.7">have him replace so we look at the</text>
  <text start="463.94" dur="7.28">acting puppet government in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="466.63" dur="8.2">using military force on their own people</text>
  <text start="471.22" dur="5.95">what is the difference here there isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="474.83" dur="5.37">any difference well Assad is elected by</text>
  <text start="477.17" dur="5.01">the people in Ukraine this government</text>
  <text start="480.2" dur="4.35">was put into place by the United States</text>
  <text start="482.18" dur="3.65">central bankers that&amp;#39;s one difference if</text>
  <text start="484.55" dur="5.07">you like this call it a difference and</text>
  <text start="485.83" dur="5.41">again we have to look at this they do</text>
  <text start="489.62" dur="3.81">not have the United States central</text>
  <text start="491.24" dur="5.04">bankers do not have a puppet government</text>
  <text start="493.43" dur="5.25">that they control in Syria so the people</text>
  <text start="496.28" dur="4.68">there behind the people they want</text>
  <text start="498.68" dur="5.04">democracy they want the right to have a</text>
  <text start="500.96" dur="5.19">different type of an election in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="503.72" dur="5.79">they put a puppet government in control</text>
  <text start="506.15" dur="7.17">and the people have no rights they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="509.51" dur="5.76">terrorists we&amp;#39;re fully behind the puppet</text>
  <text start="513.32" dur="5.07">government and even the IMF the</text>
  <text start="515.27" dur="4.8">banksters are saying listen you need to</text>
  <text start="518.39" dur="4.26">do this or you&amp;#39;re not getting your money</text>
  <text start="520.07" dur="6.36">so we can see what is happening here at</text>
  <text start="522.65" dur="7.14">the time now of course the NATO chief he</text>
  <text start="526.43" dur="5.16">is out there and he is saying Putin may</text>
  <text start="529.79" dur="4.65">be able to accomplish his objectives</text>
  <text start="531.59" dur="4.68">which simply the unrest his forces are</text>
  <text start="534.44" dur="6.54">causing it in eastern Ukraine right now</text>
  <text start="536.27" dur="6.21">there are no eastern Ukraine Russian</text>
  <text start="540.98" dur="4.44">forces there this</text>
  <text start="542.48" dur="4.409">these are the people now I put videos up</text>
  <text start="545.42" dur="4.349">in the Sentinel alerts and there&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="546.889" dur="5.161">video that shows the APC units and the</text>
  <text start="549.769" dur="4.741">military coming into a neighborhood and</text>
  <text start="552.05" dur="5.01">the people who live in the neighborhood</text>
  <text start="554.51" dur="4.8">are telling them to get out you fascist</text>
  <text start="557.06" dur="5.519">pigs and they&amp;#39;re screaming they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="559.31" dur="6.029">filming it what we are seeing here is</text>
  <text start="562.579" dur="6">that United States central bankers and</text>
  <text start="565.339" dur="6.18">NATO are trying to make it make it look</text>
  <text start="568.579" dur="5.37">like Russia is involved in this because</text>
  <text start="571.519" dur="5.19">they are trying to provoke and convince</text>
  <text start="573.949" dur="5.521">the world that we will need to go to war</text>
  <text start="576.709" dur="4.74">with Russia and they&amp;#39;re provoking all</text>
  <text start="579.47" dur="3.989">this now the people are holding the</text>
  <text start="581.449" dur="4.621">building&amp;#39;s peacefully they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="583.459" dur="5.161">armed forces there they want their right</text>
  <text start="586.07" dur="5.94">to have some type of referendum to</text>
  <text start="588.62" dur="8.64">secede from this puppet government and</text>
  <text start="592.01" dur="8.61">what is happening is Ukraine the bankers</text>
  <text start="597.26" dur="5.49">the United States central bankers will</text>
  <text start="600.62" dur="5.04">not let this happen and this is why</text>
  <text start="602.75" dur="5.459">you&amp;#39;re seeing the amount of force being</text>
  <text start="605.66" dur="6.119">used in Ukraine at this time because</text>
  <text start="608.209" dur="6.18">their whole purpose is to crush these</text>
  <text start="611.779" dur="7.161">people so they will not have any type of</text>
  <text start="614.389" dur="8.581">an election now we understand that the</text>
  <text start="618.94" dur="7.509">people of dawn ends captured spies they</text>
  <text start="622.97" dur="7.95">were posing as OSCE observers they were</text>
  <text start="626.449" dur="6.51">from NATO and they were released all 12</text>
  <text start="630.92" dur="3.69">of them they were released with the help</text>
  <text start="632.959" dur="4.261">of Russia saying let&amp;#39;s release these</text>
  <text start="634.61" dur="5.19">people it&amp;#39;s time and let&amp;#39;s send them</text>
  <text start="637.22" dur="4.59">back and they set up a route they wanted</text>
  <text start="639.8" dur="4.56">to use to bring these people back into</text>
  <text start="641.81" dur="4.44">Ukraine and the Kiev government was</text>
  <text start="644.36" dur="3.99">initially reluctant to support the</text>

  <text start="653.389" dur="3.601">because you know they had to get these</text>

  <text start="816.98" dur="7.52">moving in causing havoc and then we also</text>
  <text start="820.61" dur="7.409">saw the Opposition in masks with bats</text>
  <text start="824.5" dur="7.63">Molotov cocktails all trying to create</text>
  <text start="828.019" dur="6.81">some type of innocent incident to really</text>
  <text start="832.13" dur="4.47">rile the people up and get them doing</text>
  <text start="834.829" dur="4.32">something that they normally wouldn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="836.6" dur="4.62">and that kind of fell on its face it</text>
  <text start="839.149" dur="4.651">didn&amp;#39;t really work out and now the</text>
  <text start="841.22" dur="4.23">anti-terrorism forces are continually</text>
  <text start="843.8" dur="3.719">pushing forward and of course we had</text>
  <text start="845.45" dur="5.96">that de-escalation Geneva agreement</text>
  <text start="847.519" dur="7.38">where hmm the military didn&amp;#39;t back down</text>
  <text start="851.41" dur="6.04">whatsoever they kept all forces locked</text>
  <text start="854.899" dur="5.25">into place and a couple of hours later</text>
  <text start="857.45" dur="6.24">they went forward and moved in on the</text>
  <text start="860.149" dur="5.911">people so none of this has to do with</text>
  <text start="863.69" dur="5.73">Russia at this time there have been no</text>
  <text start="866.06" dur="6.3">Russia forces no planes there nothing in</text>
  <text start="869.42" dur="5.609">this region whatsoever all the force and</text>
  <text start="872.36" dur="5.37">all the military might is coming from</text>
  <text start="875.029" dur="6.151">the acting puppet government at this</text>
  <text start="877.73" dur="7.14">time now the Ukrainian forces are</text>

  <text start="902.06" dur="4.2">and other things not to let hardware</text>
  <text start="904.16" dur="5.609">pass and then they set the tires on</text>
  <text start="906.26" dur="5.4">fires on fire to make a barrier so they</text>
  <text start="909.769" dur="3.63">couldn&amp;#39;t get in now of course Ukraine</text>
  <text start="911.66" dur="3.539">said military operations against</text>
  <text start="913.399" dur="3.81">pro-russian separatists and of course</text>
  <text start="915.199" dur="6.121">forget pro-russian separatists these are</text>
  <text start="917.209" dur="6.24">Ukrainian people okay who want the right</text>
  <text start="921.32" dur="7.009">to secede from the puppet government and</text>
  <text start="923.449" dur="7.801">they are saying that they set these</text>
  <text start="928.329" dur="5.351">operations in motion to move into these</text>
  <text start="931.25" dur="5.07">towns and the active phase of the</text>
  <text start="933.68" dur="5.04">operation continued at dawn and avakov</text>
  <text start="936.32" dur="4.86">wrote on his facebook page we are not</text>
  <text start="938.72" dur="4.38">going to stop with these operations we</text>
  <text start="941.18" dur="4.89">are going to continue and for</text>
  <text start="943.1" dur="5.7">these people to do what we want and we</text>
  <text start="946.07" dur="4.83">can see this is exactly their whole</text>
  <text start="948.8" dur="5.55">entire thing that they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="950.9" dur="6.96">they&amp;#39;re trying to use a strong man&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="954.35" dur="7.86">hand against these people and bring them</text>
  <text start="957.86" dur="7.35">in line this or wipe them out completely</text>
  <text start="962.21" dur="6.92">I mean you can see what is going on here</text>
  <text start="965.21" dur="6.63">is clear as day and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="969.13" dur="4.3">provoking and if you notice it&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="971.84" dur="3.99">people of Ukraine as always they use</text>
  <text start="973.43" dur="4.26">always use the term pro-russian they</text>
  <text start="975.83" dur="3.87">always bring into Russia that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="977.69" dur="4.5">doing something that they&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="979.7" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re egging these people on they have</text>
  <text start="982.19" dur="6.09">the forces but all I see is the military</text>
  <text start="984.95" dur="6.12">from Ukraine and of course they named</text>
  <text start="988.28" dur="4.32">them anti-terrorism forces and you know</text>
  <text start="991.07" dur="3.63">these are the people if you look at the</text>
  <text start="992.6" dur="4.35">one video of the APC units and the</text>
  <text start="994.7" dur="3.84">military soldiers in a neighborhood it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="996.95" dur="3.36">just the people there in sweatshirts</text>
  <text start="998.54" dur="4.98">their psyche get out get out get out and</text>
  <text start="1000.31" dur="6.29">you can see how this is really going at</text>
  <text start="1003.52" dur="6.84">this point now with this missing flight</text>
  <text start="1006.6" dur="5.65">mh370 we see that a seven-minute audio</text>
  <text start="1010.36" dur="3.51">recording of the final conversations</text>
  <text start="1012.25" dur="4.05">between pilots are the missing Malaysian</text>
  <text start="1013.87" dur="4.71">jet and teams of air traffic controllers</text>
  <text start="1016.3" dur="4.83">on the ground were released the</text>
  <text start="1018.58" dur="5.43">recordings we were finding out they were</text>
  <text start="1021.13" dur="5.28">edited leading many to wonder if the</text>
  <text start="1024.01" dur="6.21">entire conversation wasn&amp;#39;t fabricated on</text>
  <text start="1026.41" dur="7.8">a soundstage and if so why would they do</text>
  <text start="1030.22" dur="6.45">this and if we really look at that if we</text>
  <text start="1034.21" dur="5.37">look at the recordings it&amp;#39;s very strange</text>
  <text start="1036.67" dur="6.63">the audio video forensic expert and</text>
  <text start="1039.58" dur="6.96">registered investigated ed premio of pre</text>
  <text start="1043.3" dur="5.61">mu forensics who has analyzed hundreds</text>
  <text start="1046.54" dur="4.17">of audio recordings has said that the</text>
  <text start="1048.91" dur="3.48">beginning and end of the recordings are</text>
  <text start="1050.71" dur="4.05">high quality with low noise floor</text>
  <text start="1052.39" dur="4.59">meaning ambient background noise is</text>
  <text start="1054.76" dur="4.89">almost silent unlike the middle</text>
  <text start="1056.98" dur="5.64">beginning at 114 continuing through 20</text>
  <text start="1059.65" dur="6.75">62 215 it&amp;#39;s a digital recording being</text>
  <text start="1062.62" dur="6.12">held up to a speaker also implying some</text>
  <text start="1066.4" dur="5.01">editing the middle section was recorded</text>
  <text start="1068.74" dur="4.59">with a microphone near a speaker but it</text>
  <text start="1071.41" dur="4.91">would be very unusual to find a</text>
  <text start="1073.33" dur="4.969">background differential at the same time</text>
  <text start="1076.32" dur="4.469">testing the Malaysian authorities who</text>
  <text start="1078.299" dur="4.771">are ever and who ever presented this</text>
  <text start="1080.789" dur="4.38">made edits for whatever reason now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1083.07" dur="5.64">going to go back to my theory that this</text>
  <text start="1085.169" dur="5.64">plane it might be repainted it might be</text>
  <text start="1088.71" dur="4.98">whatever they&amp;#39;re going to do but we will</text>
  <text start="1090.809" dur="5.46">see this plane once again it will most</text>
  <text start="1093.69" dur="5.339">likely be carrying some type of payload</text>
  <text start="1096.269" dur="5.37">headed into the United States for the</text>
  <text start="1099.029" dur="5.161">false flag event and we also understand</text>
  <text start="1101.639" dur="5.04">that Israel has a duplicate airplane</text>
  <text start="1104.19" dur="4.53">which is kept in the hangar in Israel</text>
  <text start="1106.679" dur="4.83">except the only difference between that</text>
  <text start="1108.72" dur="5.61">plane and this plane is that the Israeli</text>
  <text start="1111.509" dur="7.081">plane is the long-range model that can</text>
  <text start="1114.33" dur="6.929">fly 1200 miles so we can see that all of</text>
  <text start="1118.59" dur="5.49">this is being fabricated and this plane</text>
  <text start="1121.259" dur="4.561">will most likely be used for some type</text>
  <text start="1124.08" dur="3.54">of an event because we understand the</text>
  <text start="1125.82" dur="4.589">central bankers everything that they</text>
  <text start="1127.62" dur="5.58">plan right now is not going the way they</text>
  <text start="1130.409" dur="5.52">wanted and they&amp;#39;re losing control the</text>
  <text start="1133.2" dur="4.559">people in the Middle East are rising up</text>
